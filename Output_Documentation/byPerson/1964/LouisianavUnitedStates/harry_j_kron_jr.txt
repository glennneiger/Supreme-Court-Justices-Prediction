mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
--
members
of
this
court,
i
would
like
to
make
a
personal
observation
before
i
begin.
on
the
one
hand,
i
have
been
instructed
by
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
to
bring
his
regards
to
this
court.
secondly,
this
is
my
first
appearance
here
having
been
admitted
this
morning.
and
i
want
to
thank
this
court
and
tell
them
what
a
wonderful
thing
this
has
been
to
me
today.
as
the
court
knows,
this
is
a
suit
by
the
united
states
against
the
state
of
louisiana
and
members
of
the
board
of
the
registration
of
our
state.
it
was
instituted
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
42
u.s.c.
1971
as
amended
and
also
under
the
declaratory
judgments
act.
we,
defendants,
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
upon
the
contention
that
the
complaint
failed
to
raise
a
substantial
constitutional
question
and
failed
to
state
a
judicial
--
justiciable
controversy
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court.
the
motion
was
overruled
and
the
cause
on
the
merits
was
heard
before
the
three-judge
court.
the
district
court
judge
john
minor
wisdom
has
the
argument
that
court
rendered
the
decision
with
which
i'm
sure
all
of
you
are
thoroughly
familiar.
he
was
concor
--
he
was
concorded
by
judge
christenberry
and
dissented
for
him
by
judge
gordon
west.
in
making
the
application
to
this
court
on
appeal,
we
set
forth
to
begin
with
that
the
court's
case
should
be
heard
first
--
firstly
because
that
was
a
direct
and
absolute
contradiction
between
two
sections
of
the
district
court
in
mississippi.
the
suit
was
dismissed
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
whereas
in
our
case,
the
jurisdiction
of
question
was
maintained.
we
are
before
this
court
then,
first
of
all
in
our
brief
taking
the
position
that
we
adopt
and
subscribe
to
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
mississippi
and
maintain
that
this
suit
too
should
be
dismissed
on
the
same
grounds.
you
spend
enough
time
with
that
question.
it's
no
use
going
into
that
point
at
further.
secondly,
we
argue
that
the
board
of
registration
is
a
party
defendant.
it
is
erroneously
included
and
erroneous
like
--
erroneously
directed
to
do
certain
things
as
such
party
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
board
of
registration
has
absolutely
no
power
or
authority
over
the
registrars
of
voters.
and,
that
the
registrars
themselves
being
the
agents
of
the
state
and
it
--
and
ministerial
officers
charged
with
the
performance
and
the
--
and
the
administration
of
these
functions
should
be
before
the
court.
and
finally,
now
i
know
suddenly
that
our
statute
is
not
per
se
invalid.
and
if
there
is
any
invalidity
that
the
--
that
that
--
that
was
done
as
a
matter
of
ministerial
action.
and
that
it
should
have
and
could
be
enjoined
against
the
individual
registrars
who
have
so
violated
the
intent
and
the
intent
--
and
the
--
intent
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
the
constitutional
provision
and
the
statute.
and
finally
--
and
i
think
--
and
possibly
the
most
important
position
and
contention
that
we
make
is
that
the
lower
court
has
gone
beyond
its
authority
and
beyond
the
record
in
the
case
in
enjoining
the
use
of
the
new
citizenship
test.
particularly
in
doing
so,
in
only
21
parishes
of
the
state,
and
in
particular
--
and
it's
particularly
saying
in
so
doing,
that
it
has
pre-admitted
the
question,
that
it
has
not
ruled
on
the
question
of
the
validity
of
that
particular
amendment
to
our
law.
but
despite
that
fact
has
enjoined
the
state
in
the
use
of
this
minimum
standing
which
we,
of
course
argue
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
prescribe.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
might
explain
for
the
court's
benefit
in
the
event
that
you
are
not
completely
familiar
with
this
citizenship
test.
when
this
suit
was
first
filed,
the
only
provision
on
the
books
with
respect
to
a
requirement
to
understand
and
interpret
a
section
of
our
constitution
was
one
very
similar,
and
in
content,
and
in
purpose
almost
identical
with
the
mississippi
statute.
however,
after
this
suit
was
filed,
the
legislature
passed
a
statute
which
provided
that
the
board
--
the
powers
of
the
board
of
registration
were
expanded
and
enlarged.
whereby
said
board
acting
under
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
in
a
subsequent
constitutional
amendment,
directed
the
board
to
prescribe
a
set
of
rules
and
regulations
in
which
the
state
would
give
a
written
objective
standard
test
of
the
person's
ability
to
understand
the
--
a
republican
form
of
government.
the
--
the
--
the
test
was
formulated
and
adopted
by
the
board
of
registration
and
was
--
was
sent
out
to
the
registrars
who
are
directed
to
use
it.
at
that
point
and
this
record
will
show
this
that
at
that
point,
the
registrars
were
directed
to
discontinue
the
use
of
the
verbal
interpretation
test
and
to
use
this
new
written
objective
standard
written
test,
that
the
records
of
which
were
to
be
preserved
in
the
registrar's
office,
all
rejections
to
be
preserved
there.
if
the
court
please,
this
test
was
designed
and
issued
to
the
registrars
in
actual
compliance
with
the
formula
set
down
in
the
schnell
case.
and
the
actual
questions
for
this
test
--
these
are
now
the
cases
will
show
what
it
were
taken
from
the
manual
issued
and
published
by
the
department
of
justice
in
--
in
their
prescribed
course
of
study.
it
required
of
alien
applicants
for
citizenship
who
were
given
this
manual
for
study
in
order
that
that
may
take
a
test
of
citizenship.
of
course,
our
contention,
our
purpose
was
that
if
an
alien
applicant
for
citizenship
should
know
these
things,
then
a
citizen
of
this
country
who
is
applying
for
the
privilege
to
register
and
to
vote
should
also
know
them
and
that
that
was
not
an
unfair,
not
a
discriminatory
method
of
testing
such
knowledge.
but
it
is
one
of
the
requirements
that
we
contend
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
say.
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
anywhere
in
this
record
to
show
and
i'm
positive
that
there's
nothing
in
any
way
in
this
record
to
show
that
if
the
government
has
ever
contended
that
the
citizenship
test
has
administered
after
its
initiation
in
1962,
was
ever
discriminatorily
used
against
any
person
or
classifications.
the
simple
contention
of
the
government
there
is,
that
it
is
a
new,
more
stringent,
and
onerous
requirement
which
would
raise
the
requirements
and
establish
the
--
the
freezing
situation
which
they
have
now
ask
the
court
to
remedy
and
which
i
asked
the
court
to
remedy
by
issuing
the
injunction
against
the
21
parishes
involved.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
we
don't
dispute
--
we
don't
dispute
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph,
justice
goldberg,
but
we
do
dispute
the
conclusion
of
judge
wisdom
in
the
first
part
of
that
statement.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
he
can
find
nothing
in
this
record
to
justify
the
statement
of
the
state
board
of
registration
recently
recognized
the
arbitrary
nature
of
test
when
the
facts
will
show
that
the
board
of
registration
was
directed
to
issue
and
formulate
the
fair
and
issue
the
new
text.
although
the
act
did
not
say
in
place
of
or
in
lieu
of
the
interpretation
test,
it
is
true
that
it
was
the
legislature
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
louisiana
adopting
the
constitutional
amendment
subsequent
to
the
original
enable
the
original
statute.
it
was
the
legislature
who
changed
the
policy
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
not
the
board
of
registration,
who
gave
--
who
made
that
determination.
secondly,
it
is
also
true
that
the
constitution
and
statutes
of
the
state
permit
or
establish
as
a
standard
the
use
of
the
verbal
interpretation
test.
but,
i
have
to
disagree
with
judge
wisdom
in
that
i
--
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
requires
the
use
of
it.
we
think
it
will
be
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
state
and
its
offices
in
administering
these
statutes
to
either
give
or
not
to
give
as
the
case
may
be.
be
that
as
it
may,
even
though
it
may
still
require
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
fact
is
--
the
fact
is,
and
the
court
below
has
taken
notice
of
that
fact
which
i'll
explain
to
you
in
just
a
moment
that
the
--
the
verbal
interpretation
test
is
not
now
and
has
not,
since
april
1963
been
used.
and
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
is
any
intention
to
use
it.
now,
insofar
as
the
single
case
of
april
1963
in
webster
parish,
this
--
this
record
would
show
justice
goldberg,
that
--
that
at
the
argument
of
this
case
and
its
closure
and
submission
to
the
court,
that
i
had
at
that
time,
made
and
argued
strenuously
a
motion
of
mootness.
after
the
case
was
submitted,
one
of
the
registrars
did
begin
to
give
the
test
again.
the
government
filed
a
motion
to
reopen
the
proceedings.
they
took
to
the
position
and
she
frankly
admitted
that
she
gave
it
on
several
occasions
before
a
period
of
a
few
days.
that
was
filed
in
the
record
and
the
case
was
resubmitted.
but
since
that
time,
it
has
not
been
used,
it's
not
being
used,
nor
is
there
any
intent
to
use.
in
all
parishes
of
the
state
except
one
parish
of
either
east
or
west
of
louisiana
is
still
on
periodic
registration.
and
that
new
complete
registration
began
on
the
first
of
this
year
and
the
process
of
a
reregistration
at
this
time.
other
than
that,
all
parishes,
63,
are
on
permanent
registration.
as
i
said
before
and
just
for
purposes
of
clarity,
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
in
the
lower
court
degree
go
beyond
the
record
on
the
case.
there
is
no
evidence
to
establish
that
the
citizenship
test
is
an
additional
burden
or
is
more
difficult
than
prior
procedures.
on
the
contrary,
judge
dawkins
of
the
western
district
in
a
case,
clearly
set
forth
that
in
his
opinion,
that
the
new
citizenship
test
was
clearly
not
more
onerous,
or
more
stringent,
nor
more
than
difficult
that
it
was
a
fair
application
that
has
eliminated
the
arbitrary
discretion
of
the
registrar
that
had
been
previously
complained
of
by
the
government
and
all
of
these
suits.
that
it
was
a
simple
test
whereby
the
record
was
kept
in
the
ability
of
the
person
to
answer
the
question
to
as
in
writing
and
on
the
face
of
it
and
--
and
that
was
less
onerous.
of
course,
along
that
line
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
that,
we
don't
think
that
on
the
atkins
for
one
reason
and
of
course
under
simple
logic
for
another
that
the
state
is
at
ever
at
anytime
ever
precluded
from
making
changes
in
its
administration
and
its
laws,
in
its
statute
requiring
most
anything
under
its
police
power,
under
any
of
the
inherent
powers
of
the
state,
unless
and
until
that
change
would
be
as,
for
instance
here,
an
open
effort
to
formulate
policy
to
discriminate
against
a
class
--
a
person
or
a
class
of
persons.
we
wish
to
submit
here
that
this
record
clearly
shows
that
the
adoption
of
the
citizenship
test
in
lieu
of
the
verbal
interpretation
test
is
not
an
increase
in
the
obligations
of
the
individual.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
relaxation
of
the
test
as
easier
and
it's
simpler
and
it's
indiscriminately
applied.
we
also
feel
that
if
the
--
if
the
state
of
louisiana
does
have
the
right
first
to
--
to
make
such
a
test
and
to
establish
following
the
rule
of
schnell
in
--
in
its
every
facet.
and
that
this
test
must
in
order
to
be
enjoined
be
declared
to
be
invalid.
if
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
declared
to
be
invalid
then
it's
--
that
it
still
exists
as
a
valid
exercise
of
the
state's
right
to
use
it.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
there
is
a
master
card
of
correct
answers
for
each
of
the
tests.
i
might
add
to
your
expedition
that
--.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
it's
a
multiple
choice
thing
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
each
--
each
card
of
course
has
a
master
list
of
correct
answers
and
the
registrar
operates
from
that.
but
on
that
the
a,
b,
c
selected
is
either
correct
or
incorrect.
that's
out
of
the
six
questions,
only
four
have
to
be
answered
correctly
in
order
for
the
person
to
pass.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
the
registrar
or
the
deputy.
the
registrar
--
the
registrar
or
the
deputy.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no
sir.
the
applicant
cannot
see
the
master
card.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
in
the
--
in
the
actual
process
of
registering,
no.
the
policy
has
been
among
all
registrars
not
to
show
the
answers
to
those
cards.
however,
here
again,
is
something
not
only
in
this
record
but
i
would
think
that
this
court
knows
real
well.
that
if
there
has
been
in
the
opinion
of
anyone
in
most
stringent
and
onerous
type
of
thing,
i
think
this
court
can
take
notice
that
the
people
who
are
--
who
are
--
whom
the
government
is
intending
to
protect
here
are
actually
the
ones
who
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
new
tests
are
actually
a
less
stringent
and
a
less
onerous
kind
of
thing
because
the
negro
people
have
been
conducting
schools
and
the
whites
have
not.
and
i
think
that
is
a
fact
although
--
particularly
may
not
be
in
this
record.
it
is
a
matter
of
national
knowledge
that
these
schools
do
exist
and
they
have
been
doing
a
very
thorough
job.
so
that
when
you
talk
about
whether
or
not
the
applicants
can
see
the
answers
in
most
cases
in
many,
many
cases,
the
negro
applicant
has
the
advantage
because
they
have
been
to
the
school.
they
know
the
questions
and
they
have
been
taught
the
answers.
they
have
actually
taken
a
very
short
course
in
the
government.
the
result
of
which
is,
that
it
actually
renounce
to
that
class
benefit
and
--
and
--
and
as
a
disadvantage
to
the
ordinary
whites
who
have
up
until
this
time
at
least
not
held
any
schools
of
instruction
for
this
purpose.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
sir?
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
think
that
that
excerpt
given
there
is
a
representative
group
selected
at
random
from
this
test.
there
may
be
a
question
here
and
there
that
may
be
argued
to
be
the
most
difficult.
but
on
the
main,
these
are
questions
which
the
department
of
justice
itself
thought
was
sufficiently
important,
and
sufficiently
easy,
and
sufficiently
lenient
for
an
applicant
for
citizenship
to
understand
and
know
before
they
became
a
citizen
of
this
country.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
they're
definitely
not.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
might
answer
you,
sir
in
going
into
this.
if
you
will
note
in
this
record,
in
this
case,
the
21
parishes
enjoined
was
so
enjoined
because
there
were
depositions
taken
of
the
registrars
or
deputy
registrars
or
former
registrars
that
the
verbal
interpretation
test
had
been
given
in
those
respective
21
parishes.
now,
there
is
not
in
this
record
any
issue
of
the
existence
of
a
pattern
of
practice
of
discrimination.
there
is
no
statistical
evidence
regarding
those
21
parishes
whereby
it
was
determined.
and
there
is
no
such
finding
in
the
lower
courts
decision
that
there
was
pattern
of
practice
of
discrimination.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
of
discrimination
but
not
a
pattern
of
practice
of
such
resulting
from
statistics
of
rejections
or
statistics
of
population,
etcetera
in
the
parishes
concerned
with
which
we're
dealing.
now,
the
position
we
take
sir
there
is,
that
if
this
law
--
if
this
new
statue
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
state's
authority
to
prescribe
a
minimum
qualification,
the
--
the
--
the
possession
of
a
certain
amount
of
understanding
of
the
government.
who
is
the
fifth
president?
how
may
justices
on
the
supreme
court,
etcetera,
etcetera?
then,
if
that
--
and
the
lower
court
has
not
determined
that
statute
to
be
invalid,
then
the
state
must
of
necessity
it
seems
to
me,
either
have
the
right
to
use
it
in
all
64
parishes
of
the
state
or
not
to
use
it
in
any
of
the
parishes
of
the
state
to
--
to
-
without
--
without
definite
proof,
statistical
or
otherwise
of
the
existence
of
any
particular
pattern
or
any
evidence
to
show
that
there
has
been
specific
indiscretions
and
--
and
-
and
discriminatory
practices
in
these
21
parishes,
we
don‘t
feel
that
the
state
should
be
adjourned
from
the
use
of
it
of
a
valid
plan
and
a
valid
exercise
of
its
authority
in
establishing
and
--
and
--
and
requiring
minimum
qualifications.
the
judge
came
to
the
conclusion
--
and
i
think
you'll
find
this
to
be
correct.
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
result
in
those
parishes
as
a
result
of
the
use
of
this
verbal
interpretation
test.
now,
we
come
back
from
that
argument,
justice
goldberg,
and
we
say
that
there
is
a
remedy
at
law.
the
department
of
justice
and
the
united
states
have
been
in
court
and
our
state
beginning
with
the
mcelvin
case
some
four
or
five
years
ago.
they
have
been
constantly
in
court
contesting
the
use
of
these
so-called
citizens'
discriminatory,
illegal
perjuries.
the
fact
is,
that
the
perjuries
were
not
illegal
except
but
they
were
discriminatorily
used.
and
that
they
were
directed
solely
and
exclusively
at
negroes
who
were
on
the
rules
as
a
result
of
--
and
illegally
registered
because
of
the
disqualifications
of
our
law.
now,
what
the
--
what
the
louisiana
decision
is
doing?
and
we
cannot
follow
this
--
this
reasoning
at
all.
but
the
louisiana
decision
is
doing
is
to
first
go
on
the
theory
that
there
has
been
a
freeze.
and
now
we're
going
to
remedy
that
freeze
under
the
authority
granted
originally
in
the
--
in
the
alabama
case.
we're
going
to
remedy
this
freeze
thing.
and
we're
going
to
establish
a
minimum
standard
of
our
own
whereby
these
people
who
--
who
can
--
can
--
who
can
match
anything
that
the
white
people
have
done,
can
be
placed
back
on
the
rules
and
not
be
kept
from
voting.
we
say
that
--
that
that
is
essentially
and
fundamentally
wrong.
the
two
wrongs
never
have
made
it
right.
that
the
remedy
for
the
--
for
the
--
for
the
organization
and
if
the
negro
groups
organize
as
they
are
wish
to
good
citizens
of
this
country
and
they
wish
to
qualify
and
register
to
vote
and
we
certainly
agree
that
they
have,
if
qualified,
the
right
to
do
so,
then
they
should
be
willing
also
to
shoulder
some
of
the
responsibilities
of
that
citizenship
and
operate
within
the
framework
of
their
state
law
and
use
the
--
use
the
purging
functions
--
the
purging
statute
sat
all
there
and
perform
a
service
to
their
own
not
only
to
their
own
people,
but
to
their
state.
and
clean
off
these
--
these
rules
of
the
illegally
registered
white
people
who
are
there
and
should
not
be
there,
too.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
our
--
it's
our
firm
conviction
that
they
should
not
be
there.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
well,
because
you
see,
justice
goldberg,
what
the
--
what
the
result
of
what
this
court
did.
what
justice
--
judge
wisdom
has
done,
is
to
just
strike
down
completely
even
though
siding
the
classification
two
or
three
other.
he
has
struck
down
completely
the
right
of
the
state
to
set
any
minimum
requirement
or
standard
whatsoever.
he
has
said,
“because
you
have
been
a
bad
boy,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
do
anything.”
he
has
--
he
has
required
particularly
in
these
21
parishes,
he
has
--
he
has
--
we
believe
legislated
rather
than
--
than
--
than
issue
a
judicial
opinion.
he
has
legislated
to
the
extent
that
he
is
going
to
punish
the
state
of
louisiana
and
say,
“even
though
you
have
the
right
to
set
minimum
requirements
of
understanding
an
education,
etcetera,
literacy
and
what
not,
since
you
have
not
done
so,
we're
going
to
penalize
you
until
you
do
what
i
say”,
and
that
is
a
complete
reregistration.
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
law
to
give
authority
to
the
state
that
a
court,
equity,
or
otherwise,
can
say
to
a
state,
“you
must,
--
you
must
have
a
complete
reregistration,
otherwise
--
otherwise
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
don't
think
sir.
the
way
i
interpreted
the
opinion
that
he
necessarily
gave
that
as
an
option,
i
think
he
made
it
as
a
very,
very
strong
suggestion.
and
in
the
21
parishes
involved
actually
put
it
into
practice
by
refusing
to
permit
us
to
use
a
valid
requirement
in
the
registration
process.
justice
black,
i'm
not
quite
sure
of
my
statistics.
we
have
been
over
them
many,
many
times.
i
think
i
can
truthfully
make
this
statement
to
you.
that
in
all
--
all
of
the
21
parishes,
there
has
been
a
gradual
upward
number
of
successful
negro
applicants.
i
think
the
percentage
of
the
successful
negro
applicants
has
been
a
little
bit
larger
than
the
--
than
they
had
than
that
percentage
of
white
successful.
but
by
the
same
token
that
could
also
be
a
fallacy
of
analysis
for
the
reason
that
again
in
those
21
parishes,
we
have
found
that
those
negroes
who
are
still
failing
have
not
been
predominantly
being
failed
on
the
kind
of
this
citizenship
test
that
they
are
failing
the
all
one
application.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
mean
--
i
don't
need
to
be
testifying
but
you
ask
me
and
i'm
trying
to
give
you
to
the
best
of
knowledge.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
which
is
the
particular
one
you're
referring
to?
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
westfield,
louisiana,
there
are
--
there
has
been
a
registration
drive
there
and
there
are
some
negroes
registered
but
i
can
tell
you
now
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
there
are
some
registered
now.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
east
carroll
is
on
the
northeast
end
of
the
state
in
what
we
call
the
delta
country.
now,
that
--
that
--
that
parish
has
been
the
subject
of
a
decision
in
the
mining
case.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
oh,
yes.
there
are
over.
i
think
over
300
registered
there
now.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i'm
not
admitting
that
it
was
used
but
i
say
this
to
you,
sir.
(voice
overlap)
i
say
this
to
you
sir
that
we're
actually,
in
effect,
dealing
with
--
with
--
with
a
little
history
there
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
but
the
thing
is
it's
--
it's
smooth.
it's
not
being
used.
and
it's
no
longer
really
a
problem.
we're
complaining
up
here,
but
what
we're
complaining
up
here
is
that
just
in
the
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
to
--
to
--
to
the
complainants,
to
the
--
to
the
classroom
they're
representing.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
justice
black,
you
make
me
avenge
of
that
personally
prejudice
opinion.
i
don't
think
they
will
ever
be
satisfied.
however,
getting
back
to
the
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
to
prevent
the
repetition,
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
you
bet
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
in
these
circumstances,
yes
sir.
i
would.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
in
this
--
in
the
particular
circumstance
of
this
case,
yes.
and
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
now
the
atkins
case
i
think
was
quite—
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
by
mandatory
decree.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
by
mandatory
decree.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
we
take
this
position
that
there
is
a
remedy
at
the
law.
that
the
minimum
standard
provision
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
it's
now
available.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
it's
there
available
by
the
way
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
it
can
work.
it
hasn't
been
used.
there
has
been
no
one
thought
about
using.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no
sir,
i
can't
agree
with
that.
they
could
and
they
would
not
be
presented
from
using
it.
they
have
not
--
they
have
selected
not
to
try.
that
is
that.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
say
they
all
--
the
people
who
are
complaining
and
this
lawsuit
have
elected
not
to
try.
apparently,
so
they
have
not
so
tried.
but
the
remedy
is
there
and
it's
a
very
simple
statute
requiring
simply
that
two
persons
registered
were
voters
can
go
into
the
registration
office
and
inspect
the
applications
and
accepted
applications
of
other
registered
voters,
and
file
an
affidavit
of
challenge.
and
then
under
those
conditions,
the
registrar
is
required
mandato
--
mandatory
provision
that
each
--
that
he
or
she
is
required
to
mail
a
notice
to
the
challenged
voter
at
that
--
that
their
right
to
vote
has
been
so
challenged
and
giving
the
reasons
therefore.
the
provisions
then
relate
to
the
administrative
situation
of
the
person
coming
in,
to
either
try
to
comply
or
to
or
to
re-register
or
attempt
to
re-register
in
a
legal
and
valid
way.
and
those
provisions
are
open
to
anyone.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
but
the
fifteenth
amendment,
justice
black,
does
not
prohibit
the
state
from
setting
minimum
standards
either.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
well,
i
can't
deny
it
but
i
can't
completely
agree
either
because
let
me
say
this
if
you
please,
justice.
and
i'm
not
being
naïve
to
avoid
in
answering
anything.
but
there
are
many,
many
things
beyond
the
record
in
this
case
that
do
not
appear
in
statistical
tables.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that's
true.
there
is
--
there
are
many,
many
people
who
we
can
call
the
csi
college
who
we
can
refer
to
it,
we
can
call
in
ambitions.
we
can
call
anything
we
want.
the
fact
is,
that
this
group
of
people
until
recent
years,
when
the
--
when
it
became
important
out
of
education
and
that
group,
their
organizations,
their
leaders
are
doing,
and
we
shall
agree
to
the
fact
that
they
are
doing
a
tremendous
job
to
awaken
that
class,
not
only
to
the
importance
of
the
ballot
but
to
its
responsibilities.
the
same
token
for
years
beyond
this
and
i'm
certainly
sure,
justice
black,
that
coming
from
the
area
and
the
part
of
the
countries
from
which
you
come
that
you
know
that
i'm
telling
the
truth.
they
just
simply
want
to
be
interested
in
making
--
they
simply
we're
not
interested
as
a
class
in
making
a
start.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes
i
would,
sir.
and
i
would
say
this
and
that
it's
very
pertinent
here
that
if
this
court
will
take
a
few
moments
to
study
very
carefully
the
comparison
between
this
old
verbal
interpretation
test
and
the
new
test
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
a
copy
of
that
new
one
in
the
record.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
there
is
but
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
think
it's
explained
on
the
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
it's
in
the
record,
sir,
at
page
235,
and
explained
there
too,
the
copy
of
all
clause.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no,
sir.
however,
the
law
simply
says
that
the
registrar
is
required
to
give
this
test.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
actually
the
law,
it
says
--
it
says
the
board
of
registration
has
to
do
it
and
they
would
setup
and
set
out
this
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no,
sir.
this
is
the
complete
test
in
writing.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no,
sir
it
does
not
the
law.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
was
the
old
system.
that's
the
very
argument
i'm
making
here,
justice
black,
is
that
old
system
has
been
abandoned
and
that
although
as
judge
wisdom
says
it's
still
in
the
law.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
the
law
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir
that
section
of
the
law.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
so
that's
correct.
but
by
the
same
token
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
was
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
--
that
was
so
at
the
time
this
--
this
brief
was
filed.
it's
only
so,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
single
parish
now
in
the
state
of
louisiana
where
they're
not
registered
negroes.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
the
progress
is
being
made.
and
it's
being
made
as
a
result
of
and
despite
the
old
system
and
as
a
result
of
the
use
of
this
new
test
which
is
more
lenient
and
not
an
onerous
restriction
or
increase
in
the
obligations
of
the
individual
involved.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
they
can
ask
questions.
they
can
go
and
ask
questions
still.
it's
still
in
the
law,
sir,
that
they
can
ask
questions
about
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution,
yes.
they
can
do
that.
and
judge
wisdom
is
absolutely
correct
in
that
conclusion.
but
by
the
same
token,
we
are
telling
you
and
it
is
a
fact,
which
this
court
can
take
note,
that
it's
not
being
done
and
it
said
that
is
new
written
--
new
citizenship
test
that
has
been
substituted
for
the
old
text.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
could
do
that.
i
would
be
happy
to
do
that.
this
--
you
see
under
this
decree,
those
figures
are
already
in
the
record
in
this
case
because
the
monthly
reports
have
been
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
district
court.
and
that
information
is
already
in
this
record
and
it's
being
kept
up
the
court
has
retained
jurisdiction,
and
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
the
reports
of
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir,
no
sir,
it
is
not.
no,
sir
it
is
not.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that's
my
interpretation.
does
that
explain
to
you
sir?
and
if
do
you
still
wish
me
to
send
that
information,
i'll
arrange
that
and
be
sent
to
you
from
the
clerk?
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i'm
not
so
sure
if
it's
in
this
transcript.
i
mean
it's
not
in
the
--
in
the
transcript
but
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
the
information
is
with
the
clerk
in
the
lower
--
lower
court.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
justice
black
if
i
made
that
statement
i
was
a
little
bit,
i
was
a
little
bit
in
error.
i
didn't
intend
to
say
just
exactly
that.
what
i
was
--
what
i
was
trying
to
say
to
you
and
it
is
a
part
of
this
record.
not
since
the
decree
but
since
the
beginning
of
the
use
of
the
citizenship
test
in
1962
before
the
rendition
of
this
decree.
during
the
last
period
of
time
that
the
increases
on
the
practices
of
the
--
and
the
use
of
the
citizenship
test
has
corrected
in
great
measure
that
the
--
the
--
has
substituted
for
in
great
measure
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
verbal
test
was
a
discriminatory
device
that
the
citizenship
test
on
its
own,
one
is
not
a
discriminatory
device
and
it
follows
the
formula
to
the
letter
of
davis
versus
schnell.
and
two,
that
it
not
only
is
not
such
a
device
it
has
not
been
used
as
such.
and
three,
that
it
has
been
substituted
for
the
old
so-called
discriminatory
device.
and
fourthly,
that
it
is
not
a
more
onerous
and
stringent
requirement
but
a
more
lenient
and
fair
requirement.
now,
that
is
a
statement
that
i
intended
to
make.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no,
sir,
we're
not
complaining
about
that.
we
say
we
didn't
think
the
court
had
the
right
to
order
that.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
assuming
they
have
power,
no
sir,
i
would
agree.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
told—i
told
judge
tuttle
and
his
panel
in
october,
on
the
sixth
of
this
january.
that
rather
than
go
the
--
the
--
the
halfway
route,
rather
than
in
my
judgment
come
to
the
backdoor
where
you
could
say
you
can't
go
through
the
front,
that
we're
dealing
with
after
all
a
difference
of
opinion
and
political
ideologies.
we're
dealing
with
--
with
political
questions,
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
its
suffrage,
the
question,
the
fundamental
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
right
and
there's
also,
also
whether
or
not
that
right
of
the
voter
to
vote
is
an
absolute
right
or
whether
it's
a
limited
right
etcetera.
so
we
--
we
are
involved
here
in
--
in
fundamental
discussions
of
political
philosophies
and
ideologies.
we
maintain
of
course
that
we
have
the
right
to
maintain
a
minimal
standard.
judge
christian
barry
asked
me
on
one
occasion
whether
or
not,
if
we
set
a
minimum
standard
and
the
man
had
to
be
--
have
a
degree
as
a
phd
and
i
said
"yes,
on
theory
that
would
be
so
although
it
would
be
unreasonable
and
nobody
intends
that
sort
of
thing".
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
and
not
allowed
all
of
us
out.
but
by
the
same
token,
and
by
the
same
token,
we
maintain
that
the
state
does
have
the
right
to
set
minimum
standard
so
long
as
they
indiscriminately
apply
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
they
are
simply
taking
the
test
of
the
questionnaire
which
we
call
in
our
law
the
lr1
card,
it's
a
question
and
answer.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
of
all
classes,
yes,
there
has
been
a
tremendous
increase
in
registration
numbers
overall
because
of
our
gubernatorial
statewide
elections
this
past
fall.
but
that's
a
normal
thing
as
it
comes
around
each
four-year
period.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
sir?
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
on
the
contrary
it's
a
very
good
thing.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
exactly,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no,
on
the
contrary
he
has
--
he
has
the
authority
to
say
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
as
he
said
but
he
has
not
had.
we
contend
that
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
say.
that
even
though
this
new
requirement
is
valid
or
at
least
to
the
point
we
shall
not
at
this
time
pass
upon
its
validity
but
we
still
enjoin
its
use
and
we
say
he's
going
beyond
his
authority
to
do
just
that.
that
if
that
thing
is
under
the
freezing
prin
--
freezing
principle
is
to
be
enjoined,
and
it
must
be
enjoined
either
statewide
or
not
at
all.
because
actually
in
this
case,
if
you
become
a
little
bit
logical,
the
people
in
the
other
40
somewhat
parishes
are
being
discriminated
against
it
both
black
and
white,
as
long
as
the
people
in
21
parishes
of
the
state
do
not
have
to
take
this
test
as
a
minimum
requirement.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
it's
an
application
for
a
registration
known
as
the
lr1
card
upon
which
a
person
must
give
his
name,
his
residence,
his
age.
he
must
calculate
his
age
in
days
--
years,
months
and
days.
he
must
establish
his
citizenship
eligibility
by
saying
that
he
has
resided
in
this
ward,
and
precinct,
and
state
until
in
such
and
such
of
time.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
justice
brennan
that
is
the
issue
in
the
present
suit
which
i
just
been
submitted
to
a
three-judge
panel.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
was
about
to
--
i
was
going
into
that
to
explain.
there's
a
little
bit
more
to
it
than
a
yes
or
no.
the
fact
is
that
this
suit
contests
the
constitution
of
the
validity
of
this
particular
type
of
application.
and
there
has
been
in
that
case
much
evidence
to
show
that
there
is
not
and
has
been
some
divergence
of
--
of
application
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
--
from
parish
to
parish.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
they
have
been
denied.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes
sir;
yes
sir.
and
by
way
of
adding
i
might
say
that
although
the
government
thinks
that
the
contrary,
we
know
and
had
shown
that
whites
and
blacks
alike
and
denied
for
that
reason.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
i
don't
--
no,
i
wouldn't
but
i
would
say
this
that
those
statistics
are
in
that
other
record
and
i
don't
think
that
too
much
out
of
proportion
on
that
basis.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
right.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
right.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
no,
sir.
neither
side
has
come
in.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
and
let's
be
fair
that
it
is
a
practical
matter
both
sides
have
been
so
busy
with
other
matters
and
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
get
to
it.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
true.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
do
because
the
evidence,
he
goes
actually
beyond
what
the
evidence
purports
to
support.
the
evidence
in
these
21
parishes,
depositions
only
established
that
the
test
was
given.
there
was
no
specific
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
given
in
statistically
and
in
discriminatory
manner.
the
assumption
is
just
taken
that,
okay,
it's
given
and
it's
discriminatory
by
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
given.
now
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
actually
this,
all
of
the
other
43
parishes
did
not
give
it.
but
there
is,
i
think
in
all
its
parishes
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
not
given
in
that
and
several
of
the
other
parishes
which
again
gets
us
back
to
one
of
the
justice's
statement
a
few
moments
ago
about
justice
black
i
think
it
was
about
the
requirement
to
do
these
things
here.
here
we
find
that
the
test
complained
of
it
and
the
suit
was
not
even
given
in
over
--
in
almost
two
thirds
of
the
parishes
of
the
state
so
far
as
this
record
shows
and
that's
about
correct.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
on
a
simple
logic
--
on
a
simple
logic,
justice
goldberg,
the
two
wrongs
don't
make
it
right.
we
don't
think
the
court
has
a
right
to
say
"alright,
state
of
louisiana
through
the
registrar
voters,
you
have
destroyed
the
effect
of
your
minimum
requirements.
you
have
permitted
white
people
to
come
in
and
apply
and
to
become
illegally
registered
and
get
more
onerous
in
that
matter.
now,
you
have
set
your
own
minimum
standard
by
violating
your
own
law.
now
we're
going
to
set
your
minimum
standard
with
the
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
people.”
i
say
that
there
is
a
remedy
in
law.
that
equity
should
not,
as
in
atkins
and
as
well
so
stated
by
--
justice
--
judge
reeves
in
that
case,
that
the
court
should
not
say,
"let's
disregard
the
state
law.
let's
knock
it
down.
let's
establish
a
qualification
system
of
our
own"
just
because
you
have
been
guilty
of
doing
that.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
but
depe
--
evidence
--
the
evidence
on
those
parishes
only
went
to
the
extent
the
same
that
it
was
given.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
you
we're
questioning
that.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
now
again
i
say
that
if
--
if
this
law
is
applicable
on
a
statewide
basis,
a
right
of
a
citizen
from
x
parish
is
no
different
from
the
right
of
the
citizen
from
x
parish
over
here.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
but
you
see,
we're
overlooking
one
fact
justice
goldberg.
and
that
is
in
the
other
40
or
somewhat
parishes
after
the
new
test
was
--
was
prescribe
that
all
persons
in
all
parishes
were
having
to
take
the
objective
standard
written
examination.
so
that
now
we
have
a
situation
where
in
21
of
the
parishes
that
they
are
not
required
to
take
it
but
in
the
other
they
are
required
to
take
it.
so
in
reverse,
we
come
to
this,
this
increase
of
standards
of
a
setting
of
additional
standards
making
it
onerous
and
objectionable
as
against
the
people
in
the
21
parishes
where
the
injunctions
lie.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
well
i
--
i
don't
think
this
record
shows
that.
we're
talking
purely
about
the
inequity
of
the
--
of
the
discriminatory
and
purpose
for
use
of
the
--
of
the
verbal
test.
that's
correct.
i
think
my
time
is
up.
i
want
to
conclude
now
by
saying
that
first
again
by
reviewing
that
again
we
think
the
position
of
--
the
state
of
mississippi
should
be
maintained
and
if
it
is
of
course,
it
must
of
necessity
applied
to
this
case.
secondly,
that
our
statute
and
we
rely
on
our
brief.
we
didn't
get
time
to
cover
it
in
the
argument
here.
we
say
that
statute
is
no
invalid
per
se.
and
thirdly,
that
we
most
specifically
and
most
strongly
oppose
and
ask
this
court
to
recognize
that
the
lower
court
went
beyond
its
authority
and
beyond
the
record
in
issuing
this
injunction
against
the
use
of
a
valid
state
statute.
even
under
that
statement
of
the
lower
court
presume
not
only
presumed
to
be
valid
but
the
courts
has
expressly
says
it
is
not
at
that
time
determining
or
passing
on
its
validity.
and
that
therefore,
if
that
statute
is
valid,
the
state
has
the
right
to
use
and
then
we
must
have
been
--
that
right
should
be
recognized
in
the
injunction
and
to
these
21
parishes
desire.
and
finally
that
the
--
being
a
court
of
equity
and
this
being
an
equitable
proceeding
that
the
--
that
the
class
for
whom
this
action
was
filed
does
have
that
remedy
at
large.
and
if
so,
then
of
course,
the
--
the
--
the
injunction
should
not
have
been
issued.
mr.
harry
j.
kron,
jr.
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
yes
sir.
thank
you.
thank
you
gentlemen
very
much.
