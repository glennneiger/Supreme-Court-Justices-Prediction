j.
brennan,

is
there
a
sense
of
a
decree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
the
same?
was
a
general
rule
registered
and
being
carried
under
the
clerk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
correctly
read
judge
wisdom's
opinion
as
providing
that
if
there
would
be
a
general
new
registration
in
the
21
parishes
and
then
the
citizenship
test
might
be
used.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
authority
has
put
--
what's
happening
in
this
21
year
old,
he
can
register?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
do
they
apply?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
no
interpretation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
had
there
been
many
new
registrations
consisting
of
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
form
--
what's
the
form
that
registered
completes
now
in
the
21
counties,
what
does
that
test
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
he
is
in
error
by
a
couple
of
hours
on
his
exact
date
of
birth
does
that
--
does
that
qualify
him
--
his
application
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my
question
is,
are
registrants
denied
registration
if
they
are
erred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
i
want
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
i
want
to
get
was
the
answer
to
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
denied
registration
if
they
are
err
to
that
kind
in
the
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
injunction
against
the
use
of
the
old
test
is
statewide,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
as
i
understand
it
this
--
this
decree
enjoins
the
use
of
the
old
test
statewide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
enjoins
the
use
of
the
new
test
only
in
21
counties
on
--
except
that
--
that
it
may
be
used
in
the
event
of
a
general
reregistration
in
those
21
counties,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
i
understood
the
attorney
general
was
saying
yesterday
where
there's
some
in
those
21
counties
where
they're
using
only
the
application
form
that,
that
there
are
some
litigation
pending
about
the
use
of
that
form
--
is
that
a
--
that's
another
litigation,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
brought
by
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
have
known
that
any
registrar
is
removable
at
will?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
also
it
is
true
with
the
registrars
in
orleans
parish?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
about
grade
mr.
claiborne?
does
the
applicants
even
graded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
(voice

when
the
registrar
says
you
flunked.
the
fellow
says
“i
didn't.
i
answered
the
questions
correctly.”
now,
how
can
he
have
the
registrar
decision
“you've
flunked”
reviewed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
ten
cards.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
you
say
that
was?
