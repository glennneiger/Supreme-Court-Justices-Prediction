justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
kron,
do
you
dispute
the
finding
made
by
the
district
court
and
i'm
reading
from
83
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
which
has
the
opinion
in
the
district
court,
judge
wisdom's
opinion.
and
it
says
the
state
board
of
registration
recently
recognized
the
arbitrary
nature
of
the
test
that
was
indicated
earlier
and
this
opinion
abandoned
its
general
use
and
after
the
institution
of
the
suit.
however,
the
constitution
in
the
statute
of
louisiana
still
requires
the
use
and
understanding
the
interpretation
test.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
registrars
have
not
entirely
abandoned
it,
despite
the
institution
has
moved
it.
for
example,
this
late
april
1963,
the
reps
--
webster
register
was
using
the
interpretation
test
because
she
explained
it
still
unblocks
sometimes
she
gave
the
citizenship
test
and
sometimes
the
interpretation
test.
is
that
--
is
there
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
certainly,
i'm
correct
am
i
not
that
judge
wisdom
did
not
declare
the
citizens
to
test
them
invalidly.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
all
that
he
did
was
to
pass
a
relief
--.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand
his
order,
he
said,
until
there
is
a
general
reregistration
of
the
people
in
the
counties
that
the
interpretation
test
had
been
used
could
not
be
put
into
effect.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
why
isn't
there
actually
familiar
equitable
way
of
handling
the
relief
so
as
to
set
right
and
to
pass
the
discrimination?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
judge,
again,
i
refer
to
the
opinion
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
and
the
findings.
they
made
findings
of
discrimination?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that's
--
i
want
to
ask
you
about
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
and
would
have
to
unequal
handed
rule,
i
take
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
impliciting
your
statement.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
do
you
reach
that
the
beyond
with
this
court
did
in
equalizing
the
result?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
bad
thing?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
a
bad
thing?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
where
is
the
(inaudible).
there's
lack
of
power?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
have
no
authority
to
anyone
of
these?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
we'll
have
to
give
you
a
lot
of
questions.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
we're
trying
to
get
the
facts
correctly.
on
your
43
parishes,
am
i
correct
that
judge
wisdom
retain
jurisdiction
with
the
other
parishes?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
then
operate
the
government
the
chance
to
prove
the
same
pattern
in
discrimination
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
from
the
21
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
also
the
state
in
that
and
the
interpretation
test
was
not
saying
the
parish.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
with
that
part
of
the
case,
has
anything
happened
to
that
part?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
come
in.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
it
--
so
is
judge
wisdom's
order
or
the
district
court's
order
subject
to
attack
on
the
basis
of
the
judge
and
the
evidence
about
21
parishes,
carefully
tailoring
his
adjudication
to
where
he
has
the
evidence
with
that,
and
gave
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
offer
evidence
about
the
rest
of
the
discussion.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
would
you
say
that's
the
wrong
thing
for
the
judge
to
do?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
i'm
assuming
that
that
is
so
and
i
still
have
difficulty
in
determining
what
was
wrong
in
the
district
court's
order
and
where
to
find
the
lead
cases
where
the
court
found
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
i
understand
that
argument
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
and
requiring
about
why
you
felt
a
distinction
between
the
parishes
and
made
the
order
invalid.
i
understand
your
basic
argument
that
you've
made
it
and
i
think
it's
pretty
effectively.
but
the
--
but
the
fact
of
the
judge
said
that
if
we
have
evidence
in
these
counties
should
not
invalidate
his
order
because
he
didn't
proceed
to
make
any
declaration
about
other
parishes,
where
there
was
no
evidence.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you're
also
(voice
overlap)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
wasn't
supported
in
21.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
--
but
that's
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
claiborne,
can
you
tell
us
how
many
people
have
registered
in
this
parish
and
how
many
negroes
have
registered
since
the
district
court's
injunction
was
in
effect?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
the
registrants
whites?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
does
the
explanation
to
the
fact
that
the
disparity
in
the
application
and
the
interpretation
of
test
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
did
the
claiborne
parish
as
the
government
had
having
a
relationship
with
the
claiborne
that
we
have
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
fact,
the
--
the
district
court
(voice
overlap)
that
would
have
been
written
in
to
the
regulations
of
â€˜grandfather's
clause.'
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
claiborne,
perhaps
another
way
to
say
it
is
that
what
the
court
is
saying
to
louisiana
is
eliminate
your
past
unconstitutional
discrimination
in
voting.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
maybe
a
simple
way
of
saying
it.
