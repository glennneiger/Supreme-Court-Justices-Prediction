how
many
negroes,
in
total
are
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
your
position
that
as
to
the
difference
to
the
injunction
is
operating
against
the
new
system,
rest
not
on
the
unconstitutionality
or
invalidity
of
the
new
system
as
applied
or
as
written
but
as
it's
--
it's
being
unnecessary
adjunct
to
praise
the
effect
to
the
old
system,
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
we're
talking
about
now,
maybe
for
another
day.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
were
no
claims
that
that
was
made
in
the
application
of
the
new
system?
justice
john
m.
harlan
state
the
option
that
you
have
been
arguing
here,
arguing
or
of
reregistering
and
across
the
board
having
the
reregistration
across
the
board
to
the
effect.
