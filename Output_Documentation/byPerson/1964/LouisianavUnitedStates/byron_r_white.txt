justice
byron
r.
white
that's
quite
what
i
asked
that
you
made
the
same
objection
that
any
new
test
being
applied
to
the
group
of
people
would
then
discriminated
against
under
the
the
old
interpretation
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
must
then
--
you
must
then
--
you
--
you
have
to
get
the
character
of
the
new
test
then,
won't
you?
but,
you
say
that
is
an
issue
here.
we
know
that.
did
he
say
anything
at
all
about
this
new
test
because
if
this
is
an
issue
here,
we
have
to
put
that
aside.
let's
comp
--
litigate
that.
i
supposed
you
would
take
the
same
position,
say
they've
imposed
a
very
simple
literacy
test.
in
the
statute,
said
people
have
to
read
the
following
three
lines
than
anyone
would
take
that
anyone
who
could
read,
could
read
those
three
lines.
now,
you
would
--
would
you
take
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not,
that's
a
new
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
well
then
--
we'll
try
to
do
another
simple,
something
that's
just
new
and
simple
and
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
literacy
test
they
have
imposed
would
be
new
because
of
the
different
--
there
are
new
three
sentences.
nobody
ever
had
to
read
those
three
sentences
before.
i
know
i
suppose
you'd
object
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
we
really
do
have
to
look
--
you
didn't
have
to
look
at
the
citizenship
test,
don't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
you
said
enough
to
--
have
you
think
it's
--
do
you
think
you
said
enough
to
--
to
indicate
a
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
--
did
you
want
to
reserve
the
litigation
(inaudible)
on
one
occasion.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
it
might
--
it
might
be
dangerous
to
suppress
this
that
we
have
to
test
the
--
litigate
this
injunction.
on
the
(voice
overlap)
that
this
(voice
overlap)
must
be
constituted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
--
if
it
constitutes
to
develop
the
injunction
--
the
injunction
performed
would
mean
that
there
maybe
a
lot
of
people
in
the
record
to
assume
it
has
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
way
that
--
that
louisiana
could
then
of
course
but
we
assume
to
be
a
thousand
voter's
application
would
be
to
require
literacy
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
still
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
both
be
registered.
you
could
be
registered
under
a
valid
qualification
statute,
and
that's
the
only
way
that
louisiana
that
ever
could
ever
effectuate
this
new
--
assuming
the
--
this
new
valid
policy
or
which
we
assumed
valid
is
to
have
a
reregistration.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
how
far
it
goes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
harm
--
the
harm
really
is
that
--
that
harm
in
it's
--
if
you
allow
louisiana
to
apply
this
new
test
which
we
assume
is
valid
to
people
who
weren't
registered,
including
those
who
weren't
registered
under
the
old
law,
you
are
going
to
eliminate
a
fair
number
of
those
who
can't
pass
the
test,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
really
think
â€“
all
you're
really
saying
is
--
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
whites
registered
that
shouldn't
be
under
the
new
test.
that's
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
really
the
same
because
in
that
thing
you
would
assume
--
the
test
would
assume
to
be
valid.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
if
they
started
all
a
new
registration
campaign,
the
same
negroes
would
be
excluded
from
voting,
who
would
be
excluded
if
they
just
apply
this
new
test
to
those
who
are
not
written.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
saying
to
louisiana
if
you
want
to
--
if
you
want
to
exclude
or
--
if
it
is
--
unless
you
want
to
submit
the
white
voters
to
this
new
test,
the
price
you
must
pay
is
not
be
submitted
to
negroes
who
were
discriminated
against.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
why
shouldn't
the
court
of
equity
when
it
finds
there
has
been
a
discrimination
against
the
class
of
people
and
let's
just
assume
in
this
case
that
the
--
that
the
application
of
the
old
interpretation
test
was
discriminatory
and
that
a
great
many
negroes
were
prevented
from
registering
by
this
test.
now,
why
shouldn't
the
court
of
equity
fashion
a
remedy
which
will
eliminate
that
discrimination
not
only
for
the
future
but
to
excise
its
consequences
that
have
accumulated
in
the
past?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
normal
function
of
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
a
very
great
good
parallel
because
the
rules
--
you
may
the
right
to
change
the
rules
but,
in
this
case,
in
effect
what
you've
got
is
that
one
class
of
people
were
given
one
test
for
registration
and
another
class
of
people
were
given
another.
in
the
past,
it's
not
just
a
new
test
you
bring
up
to
the
future.
but
in
the
past
one
group
is
registered
because
it
didn't
have
to
take
the
test
and
another
group
is
registered
because
they
were.
now,
what's
the
remedy
to
those
who
have
been
excluded
--
for
those
who
have
been
excluded
from
registration
in
the
past
because
they
had
to
take
a
test
but
they
shouldn't
have
to
take?
why
shouldn't
they
be
registered
along
with
the
others
who
didn't
have
to
take
the
test?
that's
a
simple
question
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
the
--
that's
the
--
that
is
the
parallel
to
your
doctor's
case
or
the
--
those
43
parishes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
how
we've
handled
that
case
within
the
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
--
