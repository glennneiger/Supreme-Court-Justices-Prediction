i
suppose
that
that's
the
rule
that
this
man
could
be
appointed
in
notary
republic
in
maryland
even
though
he
said
what
he
believed
about
what
you're
saying?

and
to
name
these
soldiers,

what
position
would
that
place

justice
hugo

black
if
you
name
these
soldiers,
officers,
you
can
draft
these
officers
instead
of
soldiers,
would
they
come
under
that
doctrine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
that
you're
bringing
in
torcaso
which
may
or
may
not
be
relevant.
but
if
it
is,
i
would
think
that
if
the
government
could
not
require
an
officer
to
take
an
oath,
maybe
he
couldn't
require
soldiers
to
take
an
oath.

yes.

would
that
apply
for
an
officer
of

army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
at
that
point
about
socrates
you're
answering
these
questions
now
really.
are
you
saying
you
demand
in
some
ordering
position
that
socrates
wrote
in
disclosing
statement
that
it's
translated
right?
we
go
out
with
separate
ways,
i
to
die
and
you
to
live
which
is
best.
god
