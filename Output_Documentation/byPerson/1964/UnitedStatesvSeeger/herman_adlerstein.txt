mr.
herman
adlerstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
justices
of
the
court.
the
government
conceded
yesterday
that
this
respondent
believed
in
the
supreme
being.
they
only
left
one
issue
open
and
that
was
whether
he
had
personal
beliefs
or
his
beliefs
related
to
superior
duties.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
record,
pages
44
through
46,
showing
conscience
objection
was
based
upon
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
he
cites
from
moral
standards
which
his
divinely
given
reason
could
accept.
man
was
partly
akin
to
the
supreme
reality
and
partly
spiritual.
he
had
dignity
and
life
is
sacred.
therefore,
he
could
not
sacrifice
another
man's
life.
all
of
these
are
related
to
supreme
being
and
it
is
therefore
not
personal.
there
is
no
personal
connection
at
all.
the
government
still
says
that
these
beliefs
are
personal
not
related
to
a
supreme
being.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
also
to
the
government's
brief,
pages
25
and
26,
in
which
they
set
forth
at
least
eight
or
10
superior
duties
which
this
respondent
has
admitted
–
which
the
government
has
admitted
this
respondent
has
eight
or
10
superior
duties.
and
then
i
would
refer
the
court
to
--
there
are
too
many
to
consider
in
the
record
73
to
83,
100
to
102,
in
which
many
superior
duties
are
shown.
they
certainly
have
--
had
a
--
there
were
two
relationships
to
deity,
one
was
a
vertical
relationship
and
one
was
a
horizontal
relationship.
the
vertical
was
a
direct
relationship
with
man
to
god
alone.
the
horizontal
was
a
relationship
of
man
to
god
to
his
fellowmen
which
means
he
was
concerned
with
his
duties
towards
his
fellowmen
and
certainly
there's
nothing
personal
about
that
even
though
it's
related
to
man
because
that's
what
all
religion
is,
your
relationship
to
god,
to
man.
mr.
herman
adlerstein
you
started
what?
mr.
herman
adlerstein
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
i've
cited
that
in
my
brief.
if
i've
given
various
examples
of
that.
now,
he
said
they
were
givens
of
life,
givens
which
are
given
from
deity
such
as
life
which
must
be
protected.
his
duty
is
to
learn
about
it
and
protect
it.
he
said
his
acceptance
of
the
world
involved
altruism,
brotherhood,
and
love
of
fellowmen.
and
he
said
the
man
is
closer
to
god.
i
said
one
point
is
this
godness
is
deity,
and
he
says
man
is
closer
to
godness
when
he
says,
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
be
inducted
into
the
arm
services
is
because
of
the
way
i
feel
about
human
life
and
one
who
says
i
wonder
if
they'll
suddenly
overseas,
i
always
did
want
to
travel,
which
certainly
shows
a
superior
duty
to
his
fellowmen.
and
he
said
that
man
is
obeying
a
higher
law
than
a
social
or
legal
one
when
he
basis
his
action
and
attitudes
to
stem
from
the
way
he
feels
about
the
basic
givens
of
life,
the
basic
givens
means
there's
something
given
by
deity.
now,
the
government
says
all
these
beliefs
are
personal.
and
here's
what
he
says.
the
essence
of
his
religious
quest
to
seeking
knowledge
of
the
ultimate
nature
of
that
created
by
the
supreme
reality
or
man
in
searching
for
moral
standards
which
is
divinely
given
reason
could
accept
or
satisfying
the
ultimate
nature
of
man.
the
government
says
that
his
most
important
religious
lord
of
no
man
or
that
will
ever
willfully
sacrifice
another
man's
life
didn't
qualify
as
his
superior
duty.
but
respondent
preceded
this
statement
when
he
said
life
is
all
that
man
has
ever
given,
all
of
these
arranged
by
man.
divinely
given
things
are
very
warmth
joy,
sense
of
aliveness
because
of
this
life
is
sacred.
death
ends
divinely
given
things.
and
that's
why
he
couldn't
kill.
now,
the
government
says
that
respondent
did
know
the
nature
of
deity.
of
course,
that's
true.
no
religion
ever
professed
to
know
the
nature
of
deity.
we
have
that
in
the
case
of
moses
and
the
burning
bush
when
god
appeared
before
moses
in
the
form
of
a
burning
bush.
and
then
there
could
be
many
others
in
the
new
testament
in
the
form
when
a
voice
came
out
of
the
clouds.
i've
cited
these
in
my
brief.
now,
it
also
says
that
prior
forth
that
he
disagreed
with
theism.
he
didn't
disagree
with
theism.
he
merely
said
he
didn't
posit
theism.
on
the
other
hand
even
if
he
disagreed
with
theism,
paul
tillich
and
that's
quoted,
and
this
is
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
he
said
--
paul
tillich
said
that
theism
is
transcended
by
absolute
faith,
the
government
itself
in
its
argument
and
in
his
brief
said
that
paul
tillich
is
a
man
of
religion
when
they
accept
him.
the
government
further
said
that
these
views
are
political
and
sociological.
well
of
course
political
and
sociological
views
in
the
first
place
can't
be
religious
and
are
religious
if
they
are
backed
up
by
deity.
and
all
the
churches
and
all
the
center
gods
practice
politics
and
religion.
politics
and
sociology
and
economy
and
all
these
different
practices
because
that
has
to
do
with
man
and
must
be
part
of
religion
because
the
religion
is
concerned
with
these
things
as
long
as
it
is
supported
by
deity.
it
all
comes
from
the
laws
of
god
that
we
must
be
interested
in
our
fellowmen.
now,
when
i
say
these
views
are
sociological
and
political,
he
said
he
faced
his
conscientious
objection
in
the
above
convictions
which
said
that
god
is
the
creator
of
man.
life
is
all
that
he
has
ever
given.
life
is
sacred.
no
man
ought
ever
sacrificed
other
man's
life.
now,
this
certainly
is
not
a
personal,
political,
or
sociological
reason.
he
even
when
he
explained
it
into
more
detail,
he
said
that
war
is
incompatible
with
this
most
sacred
conviction.
even
the
most
deprived
persons
have
spiritual
aspect,
all
this
--
all
the
same
as
anybody
else
in
relation
to
deity.
these
are
all
values,
the
basement
was
contradicted
to
sacred
convictions.
now
he
entered
some
questions
that
regard
to
under
what
circumstances
he
would
use
force.
and
he
said
that
all
his
answers
were
these
and
so
that
anything
he
said
which
sounds
personal
was
not
personal.
i'm
not
personal
because
they
all
are
related
to
this
statement.
they
have
the
result
of
these
basic
religious
convictions
concerning
the
sanctity
of
life
and
the
dignity
of
the
individual.
now,
these
certainly
do
stem
from
deity
and
in
that
person
at
all.
and
finally
he
whines
it
up
by
saying,
one
can
stand
for
the
sanctity
of
life
by
not
killing
when
his
most
sacred
convictions
tell
him
not
to
kill.
now,
even
if
we
assume
that
some
of
these
reasons
were
personal,
i'm
not
conceding
it
but
i'm
going
to
assume
it
that
some
of
these
reasons
were
personal.
he
gave
enough
reasons
which
were
related
to
deity
to
cause
him
to
be
accepted
as
religious
statements,
the
mere
fact
that
some
people
have
certain
personal
reasons.
there
are
only
some
of
them
who
are
personal.
the
others
who
are
religious
could
not
be
tracked
from
that
and
this
court
has
actually
held
that
and
--
and
the
sicurella
case.
the
mere
fact
of
having
some
convictions,
religious
and
some
not,
if
the
religious
convictions
meet
the
statute
six,
section
6
(j)
then
all
the
religious
statements
are
accepted
and
qualify
the
person
to
be
within
the
section.
the
--
we
say
that
when
the
department
of
justice
recommended
that
these
beliefs
were
moral
beliefs
that
that
was
an
erroneous
recommendation
and
therefore
the
classification
cannot
stand.
there
was
a
very
important
paper
even
submitted
to
the
hearing
officer
in
which
religious
beliefs
were
set
forth
and
this
was
called
a
moral
statement.
and
whereas
it
actually
set
forth
statements
of
religious
convictions
in
which
he
say
it
refers
to
the
spirit
of
this
godness
and
he
said
this
godness
was
the
same
as
gandhi's
real
presence
of
god
within.
and
then
he
whined
up
by
saying
“god
is
love”.
and
these
certainly
are
religious
statements
and
when
the
court
made
--
when
the
department
of
justice
made
these
statements
that
calling
it
moral
convictions
then
of
course,
it
meant
an
erroneous
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
and
it
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
herman
adlerstein
well,
that
was
a
43-page
statement
which
was
submitted
to
the
local
boards
and
that
the
local
board
hearing
under
somebody
eighth
and
ninth.
mr.
herman
adlerstein
that
appears
in
connection
with
the
hearing
or
the
--
hearing
officer
and
the
department
of
justice
as
exhibit
42
at
page
127.
mr.
herman
adlerstein
it
starts
so
by
saying
religion
consists
of
a
deeply
felt
consistent
set
of
values
and
so
forth.
and
then
i
refer
to
the
second
paragraph
where
he
equates
his
godness
with
gandhi's
mysterious
power
and
which
he
whined
up
and
says
he
felt
the
real
presence
of
god
within
which
is
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page.
and
then
the
bottom
of
page
20
--
129
which
is
two
pages
later
says,
thus
the
expression,
“god
is
love
for
all
these
limitations,
thus
succeed
in
pointing
to
an
objective
source
of
morality.”
now,
this
god
then
was
called
by
the
hearing
officer
a
statement
on
a
moral
position
in
spite
of
all
these
references
to
deity.
the
local
board
found
the
respondent
to
be
honest
in
his
beliefs,
and
therefore
accepted
all
the
statements
and
religion,
and
otherwise.
on
the
other
hand,
the
hearing
officer
because
of
the
certain
suspicion
of
the
timing
of
his
claim
and
making
a
claim
deferment
for
a
back
injury
has
said
that
he
was
insincere
claim.
so
he
made
two
recommendations
that
he
was
insincere
and
also
that
his
belief
was
a
moral
code
and
not
a
religion.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
made
an
erroneous
recommendation
regarding
the
moral
code
instead
of
religion
and
the
appeal
board
not
having
decided
on
which
ground
it
was
making
its
classification,
therefore,
the
classification
cannot
stand
the
course
of
the
two
contradictions.
there
was
a
contradictory
report
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
which
--
which
one
was
adopted
and
that
the
court
below
assumed
that
the
adopted,
the
statement
that
these
beliefs
were
moral.
and
further
the
court
said
that
unless
a
broad
interpretation
that
was
made
by
the
statute
to
include
this
religion
as
well
as
other
religions,
it
might
be
unconstitutional
and
in
order
to
avoid
a
possible
unconstitutionality,
this
religion
must
be
considered
equal
to
all
other
religions
that
have
been
within
section
6
(j)
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
perhaps
my
time
is
up.
