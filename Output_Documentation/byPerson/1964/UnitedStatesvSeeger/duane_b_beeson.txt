mr.
duane
b.
beeson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
to
which
i
am
going
to
address
my
argument
is
the
peter
case,
number
29,
which
was
discussed
in
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
yesterday.
and
it's
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
issued
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction
of
forest
britt
peter
for
refusing
to
submit
himself
to
induction
into
the
armed
services.
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated
yesterday
peter
had
maintained
throughout
the
proceedings
before
the
draft
board,
the
trial
court,
as
he
was
entitled
to
exemption
as
a
conscientious
objector
under
section
6
(j)
of
the
act.
there
are
two
questions
before
the
court
in
the
peter
case.
one
is
the
constitutional
question
of
which
has
been
discussed
in
seeger.
but
the
threshold
of
the
question
is
whether
peter
qualifies
under
the
supreme
being
test
as
it
is
written
and
properly
construed
in
the
section
6
(j)
of
the
act.
more
specifically,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
misconstrued
and
misinterpreted
the
supreme
being
test
and
accordingly
the
wrong
rule
of
law
was
applied
in
this
case.
a
similar
case,
similar
question
will
also
be
raised
in
the
jakobson
case
because
both
jakobson
and
peter
had
taken
that
position
that
the
do
need
the
requirements
of
the
supreme
being
test
a
position
which
seeger
does
not
take.
as
the
government
has
stated,
neither
the
constitutional
nor
the
statutory
questions
in
any
of
these
cases
can
be
properly
considered
without
having
firmly
in
mind
the
nature
of
the
beliefs
which
are
involved.
and
accordingly
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
summarize
peter's
statement
of
the
belief
as
presented
in
the
record.
i
think
it's
proper
to
dispose
it
once
however
i
have
certain
misconceptions
that
i
think
may
have
arisen
in
the
solicitor
general's
argument
with
respect
to
peter
and
some
of
his
background,
some
of
his
beliefs.
i
think
that
there
are
certain
considerations
that
were
raised
here
which
cannot
be
properly
accepted
by
the
court
in
reaching
a
decision
in
this
case.
i
refer
to
several
of
the
factors
to
which
the
solicitor
general
mentioned
as
convincing
him
and
supported
the
government's
position
that
peter's
claims
were
properly
denied.
it
was
mentioned
for
example
that
peter
had
no
religious
background,
no
family
religion
in
the
course
of
his
being
raised.
it
was
also
mentioned
that
peter
did
not
originally
claim
an
exemption
at
the
time
that
he
registered
for
the
draft
or
filled
out
the
classification
form.
thirdly,
it
was
mentioned
that
he
belongs
to
no
religious
sect,
and
has
adopted
no
body
or
organized
body
of
systematic
religious
principles.
he
was
pictured
as
being
a
person
who
is
just
stubborn
in
his
own
intellectual
convictions
with
respect
to
any
number
of
things
that
he
considers
important.
now,
these
considerations
are
relevant
only
to
the
question
of
whether
peter
was
sincere
in
his
beliefs.
they
have
no
relevance
as
to
the
substantive
content
or
the
nature
of
what
suppose
the
beliefs
are.
and
of
course,
it's
perfectly
true
that
a
conscientious
objector
registrant
may
be
denied
his
exemption
status
that
he
is
shown
to
be
insincere.
but
the
question
of
insincerity
has
been
eliminated
from
this
record
altogether
for
purposes
of
decision
here.
the
ninth
circuit
and
i'm
quoting
from
its
opinion,
has
assumed
that
the
appellant
petitioner
here
was
absolutely
sincere.
instead,
the
sole
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
that
it
felt
that
peter
did
not
qualify
having
met
the
--
as
having
met
the
supreme
being
test.
so
the
question
is
not
sincerity,
the
question
is
not
whether
it
was
religious
background
and
peter
has
avoided.
or
what
time
that
he
raised
the
question
of
his
exemption
status.
the
question
is
what
is
the
content
of
his
beliefs
as
stated
in
the
record?
and
do
they
meet
the
supreme
being
test?
when
the
classification
form
was
originally
filled
out,
not
the
classification
form
that
the
forms
for
the
conscientious
objector
was
originally
filled
out
by
peter
in
this
case,
he
came
to
the
question
of
which
said,
do
you
believe
in
the
supreme
being?
and
he
wrote
in
the
form
at
that
point,
“it
depends
on
the
definition.”
he
expanded
his
views
in
a
separate
sheet
which
he
attached
to
the
form.
and
incidentally,
this
statement
of
his
that
depends
on
the
definition,
appear
throughout
all
of
the
various
proceedings
which
peter
went
through
before
the
draft
board,
the
appeal
board
even
into
the
trial
court.
he
was
never
certain
that
any
time,
what
the
government
meant
by
the
term
supreme
being.
and
i
suspect
that
our
presence
here
today
would
indicate
that
he
has
some
reason
to
be
uncertain
himself.
there
is
uncertainty
perhaps
in
the
phraseology
inherently.
but
in
the
sheet
which
he
attached
to
the
form,
he's
made
the
following
statements.
he
says,
the
human
life
for
me
is
a
final
value
like
this
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i'm
reading
from
page
27
of
the
record,
mr.
justice,
and
it's
also
reprinted
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
since
the
human
life
form
is
for
me
a
final
value,
i
considered
a
violation
of
moral
law
to
take
human
life.
i
think
i
have
reached
this
conviction
out
of
my
reading
of
such
writings
as
those
of
blake,
(a
christian
mystique)
noted
in
parenthesis,
emerson,
whitman,
and
moore,
modern
poets
who
have
touched
on
the
question.
i
consider
this
belief
to
be
superior
to
my
obligation
to
the
state.
and
insofar
as
this
conviction
is
religious,
it
has
been
best
described
by
reverend
john
haynes
holmes
as
follows.
religion
is
the
consciousness
of
some
power
manifest
in
nature
which
helps
man
in
the
ordering
of
his
life
in
harmony
with
his
demands.
it
is
the
supreme
expression
of
human
nature.
it
is
man
thinking
his
highest,
feeling
his
deepest,
and
living
his
best.
he
also
made
his
statement
in
the
same
form
on
the
same
page
of
the
record
indicating
that
he
believed
that
human
life
and
human
experience
was
--
and
the
human
spirit
was
sacred.
before
the
draft
board,
peter
submitted
other
statements
that
supported
his
position
and
an
explanation
of
his
beliefs.
and
he
wrote
as
follows
in
one
of
the
statements.
this
is
on
page
33
of
the
record
which
is
reprinted
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
i
quote,
“i
have
this
god
inside
me.
to
be
truthful,
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
long
or
short
god,
or
even
a
superior
god
much
less
a
supreme
being.
and
i
have
no
idea
what
its
sex
is.
i'm
even
worried
about
calling
it
god
that
after
all
a
great
deal
of
death
has
been
done
in
the
name
of
god.
this
god
i
have
inside
me
goes
off
every
once
in
a
while
and
opens
me
to
emotions,
to
beauty,
sadness,
and
sadness
of
the
universe.
that
is
now
and
again
i
feel
the
compulsion
to
meet
the
world
around
me,
i'm
filled
with
wonder,
i'm
possessed
as
it
were.
i
feel
so
good
i
think
i'm
crazy.
so
my
god
isn't
beyond
me,
it's
within
me.
it
opens
me
to
godliness
in
the
world.”
before
the
appeal
board,
he
furnished
a
further
statement
stating
it
very
briefly
on
page
--
this
is
on
page
57
of
the
record,
i
believe,
that
he
is
moved
by
many
of
the
elements
in
the
world
and
creation.
he
states,
he
might
say
i
believe
in
them.
i
believe
in
these
elements
because
they
are
there.
in
subsequent
statements
including
a
letter
to
general
hershey,
he
refers
to
--
now
i'm
quoting
from
page
--
from
the
letter
beginning
on
page
82
of
the
record.
he
says,
“i
place
the
stress
of
my
belief
on
the
products,
the
elements
in
creation
rather
than
on
a
reverence
towards
the
possible
creator
of
these
elements
and
this
piece
of
the
universe.
these
are
reverence
for
the
elements
in
the
universe
before
that
of
the
possible
creator
might
be
an
orthodox
but
it
does
not
foreign
to
religious
thought
(witness
the
writings
of
buddha
those
were
attributed
to
him
and
early
followers).
and
they
lay
out
to
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
think
that
there
is
certainly
biblical
support
or
precisely
to
that
point
of
view
justice
goldberg.
he
also
states
that
he
feels
that
it's
proper
to
turn
his
conviction
religious
because
it's
based
i'm
quoting,
“on
a
vision
and
a
dedication
to
that
vision.
and
i
feel
this
vision
and
my
commitment
to
it,
it's
into
a
depth
of
tradition
having
gotten
into
specific
historical
group.”
he
says
further,
“i
motivated
by
what
albert
schweitzer
calls
a
reverence
for
life.
i
think
of
myself
as
a
receptive
organ
through
which
the
tragedy
and
beauty
of
the
world
are
perceived.”
and
the
final
--
the
next
to
final
statement
that
i
will
read
is
as
follows.
“the
presence
of
other
living
beings
in
the
universe
sounds
like
call,
presents
a
vision,
a
fact,
mysterious
reality
that
i
cannot
deny
into
which
i
feel
an
impulse
to
relate.”
the
final
quotation
which
i
think
will
help
summarize
the
views
of
britt
peter
is
found
on
page
86
of
the
record,
which
he
states,
“there
is
a
love
of
life
and
reverence
toward
living
things
expressed
by
many
poets
throughout
the
ages.
they
seem
to
be
brothers,
the
heir
of
some
common
goddess
though
he
has
never
been
finally
named
or
particularized.
now
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
within
the
meaning
(voice
overlap)
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
i
have
a
conceptual
difficulty,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
comporting
the
idea
of
polytheism
into
the
term
“a
supreme
being”.
your
point
may
well
be
taken,
i
don't
know.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
it
seems
to
me
that
a
supreme
being
by
its
own
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
with
the
supreme,
it
almost
connotes
the
feeling
of
exclusiveness
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
it's
difficult
to
concede
a
co-equal
supremacies
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
we
may
be
dealing
in
semantics,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
divinity
of
course
has
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes
of
threefold
co-equal
power,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
possible
or
correct
to
use
the
term
supreme
with
respect
to
anyone
of
them
in
that
sense.
perhaps
and
i
think
that
we
agree
with
what
we're
saying
that
we
have
difficulty
with
the
words
we
used
to
articulate
our
thoughts
and
this
is
not
unique
in
this
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
it
certainly
is.
now,
it's
not
easy
of
course
to
say
in
one
or
two
sentences,
words
that
will
describe
exactly
what
mr.
peter
believed.
i
think
that
his
beliefs
probably
can
best
be
--
if
they
have
to
be
classified
at
all
into
a
--
into
the
category
of
mysticism.
he
certainly
acknowledges
some
type
of
power
by
these
beliefs,
some
type
of
power
that
exists
and
as
he
says
the
mysterious
reality
some
power
manifest
in
nature,
call
it
what
you
will.
he
doesn't
pretend
to
define
it.
he
can't.
he
doesn't
think
that
he
can.
but
its
existence
is
nonetheless
acknowledged
and
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
deal
with
the
statements
that
i
have
summarized
here
in
any
other
way
it
is
consistent
with
what
they
mean.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
determined
that
these
beliefs
did
not
come
within
the
definition
of
supreme
being.
at
this
point,
i
think
that
it's
very
important
to
understand
the
precise
question
before
the
court
in
terms
of
the
decision
that
must
make
in
view
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
and
here,
i
feel
the
government
has
not
put
the
question
with
sufficient
preciseness
with
deference
to
the
--
the
government
and
particularly
to
his
advocate
into
his
class
when
i
learned
the
law
when
he
followed
a
somewhat
different
calling.
i
think
that
the
question
is
not
whether
the
--
there
would
be
support
in
this
record
or
the
draft
board
to
find
that
peter
did
not
believe
in
a
supreme
being.
rather
the
question
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
has
applied
the
correct
rule
of
law
in
adjudicating
the
record
before
it,
in
adjudicating
peter's
case.
the
ninth
circuit,
this
is
fundamental
to
my
position
here,
has
taken
the
view
that
supreme
being
under
section
6
(j)
of
the
act
requires
a
belief
and
a
duty
indeed
i
think
--
well
i
can
go
so
far
as
to
say
an
anthropomorphic
god.
that
appears
as
far
as
i
can
discern
to
be
the
point
of
view
and
the
point
of
departure
for
the
court
below.
in
this
sense,
we
have
a
different
situation
that
we
have
in
either
of
the
jakobson
case
or
the
seeger
case
both
of
which
came
out
f
the
second
circuit.
now,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
demonstrate
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
what
i
have
stated
because
it
does
alter
the
nature
of
the
question
to
be
decided.
if
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law
and
has
misinterpreted
section
6
(j),
i
don't
think
that
this
conviction
up
here
can
stand
irrespective
of
what
the
regional
trier
of
fact
might
have
been
able
to
conclude
on
the
basis
of
the
various
fragments
in
the
record.
the
reason
that
i
give
for
my
view
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
followed
in
this
case,
are
as
follows,
the
fundamental
decision
which
the
ninth
circuit
has
followed,
since
these
world
war
ii
period
is
the
berman
case
that
was
its
own
decision.
in
berman,
the
ninth
circuit
departed
from
the
kauten
view
that
religion
and
under
the
1940
act
could
be
--
could
include
--
was
comprehensive
enough
to
include
the
voice
of
conscience,
and
said
that
it
was
--
that
religion
required
something
more
than
that,
and
to
determine,
to
articulate
what
more
was
required
the
ninth
circuit
in
berman
quoted
justice
hughes'
dissent
in
the
macintosh
case,
and
the
quote
was
as
follows.
“the
essence
of
religion
is
belief
in
a
relation
to
god
involving
duties
superior
to
those
arising
from
many
human
relations.”
and
secondly,
the
berman
case
also
quoted
justice
hughes'
language
in
the
same
case,
macintosh
case,
philosophy,
and
morals,
and
social
policy
without
the
concept
of
deity
cannot
be
said
to
be
religion
in
a
sense
of
that
term
as
it
is
used
in
the
statute.
berman,
as
i
see
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
religion
and
a
belief
in
a
deity
are
one
and
the
same
thing.
in
the
peter
case,
the
case
told
him
before
the
court
the
ninth
circuit
not
only
relied
on
the
berman
but
quoted
the
same
descending
language
of
justice
hughes
where
he
equates
religion
with
a
belief
in
god.
now
this,
in
my
view,
is
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
congress'
intent
when
it
used
the
term
supreme
being.
i
think
that
congress
meant
a
concept
broader
than
an
anthropomorphic
deity
but
it
used
supreme
being.
and
in
this
point
of
view,
i
have
the
company
of
the
government.
the
government
accepts
that
same
basic
interpretation
of
the
word
supreme
being.
but
the
government
says
nothing
about
the
berman
case
or
nothing
about
the
peter's
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
in
my
view
makes
quite
an
opposite
reading
of
the
term
supreme
being.
this
places
the
peter
case
in
a
somewhat
different
context
i
think
but
neither
the
seeger
nor
the
jakobson
case.
we
are
dealing
here
as
you
see
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below
which
has
interpreted
supreme
being
not
as
the
second
circuit
has
but
to
require
some
kind
of
acceptance
of
a
anthropomorphic
deity.
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
in
that
respect,
as
the
government
would
indicate
if
it's
so
to
use
the
import
of
the
decision,
then
the
conviction
cannot
stand.
and
i
think
that
it
becomes
incumbent
to
view
to
require
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
at
the
least
or
i
think
in
this
particular
record,
this
case
would
–-
with
this
the
court
would
have
the
option
itself
of
reviewing
the
record
and
coming
out
with
the
determination
that
peter's
beliefs
qualify
him
for
exemption
under
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute.
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute
and
here
again
the
government
and
i
in
court
is
that
acceptance
of
any
type
of
faith
or
belief
and
that
authority
beyond
that
and
there,
and
call
it
what
you
will,
some
ultimate
authority
which
goes
beyond
human
relationships,
then
there
is
an
adequate
basis
for
the
exemption.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
this
is
true,
your
honor
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
what
it
means
by
that.
i'm
sure
that
from
reading
the
rest
of
it,
the
context
is
that
there
are
two
sides
of
this
picture.
one
is
the
supreme
being
side
and
the
other
side
is
that
if
you
don't
believe
in
that,
you
necessarily
are
governed
by
--
if
you're
sincere,
governed
by
a
personal
moral
code
or
political,
sociological
other
considerations
of
that
nature.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
sets
up
the
same
dichotomy
that
this
language
of
the
statute
itself
set
so.
but
in
my
view
it
does
not
give
sufficient
breadth
to
one
facet
of
that
dichotomy
namely
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
“supreme
being”.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
it
hasn't
said
one
way
or
another,
perhaps
it
assumed
sub
silentio
in
the
--
by
the
nature
of
this
argument
that
it
makes.
but
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
as
saying
that
there
is
absolutely
no
room
for
doubt
in
the
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
either.
the
ninth
circuit
is
having
as
much
trouble
apparently
as
everyone
else
of
finding
proper
words
to
express
his
feelings.
but
the
frequency
with
which
it
uses
the
term
deity,
and
god,
and
relies
upon
that,
at
best
suggests
a
very
serious
ambiguity
and
the
more
probable
law
i
think
is
the
conclusion
that
it
is
talking
about
something
on
the
lines
of
the
fundamentalist
or
anthropomorphic
god.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
heavenly
father
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
an
identity,
it
does
not
use
the
word
anthropomorphic.
it
does
use
the
word
god.
it
does
use
the
word
deity.
perhaps,
i
am
embellishing
by
adding
that
phrase.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
we
may
all
end
up
there.
the
conclusion
to
my
argument
on
this
phase
is
the
case
is
that
peter's
beliefs
do,
i
think,
necessarily
bring
him
within
the
concept
of
a
faith
in
something
broader
than
man's
obligation
to
man
alone.
that
may,
well
be
religion
as
justice
goldberg
has
suggested
by
one
of
his
questions.
but
we
don't
have
to
stop
there
in
this
case.
peter
talks
about
some
power
manifest
in
nature.
he
talks
about
the
god
inside
him,
the
mysteries
of
the
universe,
mysterious
reality,
mystery
of
the
heart
of
the
essence
of
being
alive.
now,
those
are
all
phrases
which
i
have
taken
under
his
own
statements.
this
is
something
which
goes
beyond
near
human
relations.
it
may
not
be
god
and
indeed
he
indicated
quite
frankly
that
he
didn't
believe
in
god
and
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
that
he
didn't
believe
in
god.
but
it
goes
to
a
belief
in
some
higher
power
even
though
he
can't
define
that
power.
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
requirement
in
section
6
(j).
indeed
if
there
could
be
one
constitutionally
that
the
applicant
must
be
able
to
define
the
nature
of
the
power
in
which
he
believes
is
only
that
he
held
post
of
the
belief
in
the
existence.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
will
go
further
than
that
to
say
that
it
compels
that
conclusion.
and
that
is
why
that
i
say
that
i
think
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
remedy
in
this
case
for
this
court
to
remand
with
the
directions,
giving
a
correct
definition
of
supreme
being
with
the
directions
to
the
court
below
to
reevaluate
the
--
the
record
in
light
of
the
correct
interpretation.
i
think
that
the
record
in
here
is
clear
enough
so
that
there's
no
need
to
do
that.
that
we
have
here
a
man
that
believes
in
some
type
of
higher
authority
and
there's
the
only
possible
reasons
for
not
concluding
that
or
those
which
had
been
advanced
by
the
solicitor
general
which
are
not
pertinent
to
the
content
of
the
belief
it
only
as
to
a
sincerity.
but
sincerity
as
i've
indicated
has
been
precluded
in
consideration
by
this
court
by
the
assumption
made
below.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
only
thing
we
have
to
go
on
are
justice
--
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
report
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
hearing
officer
under
the
department
of
justice,
both
concluded
that
peter
did
not
have
a
belief
in
relation
to
a
supreme
being.
this
followed
such
questions
as
for
such
statement
in
the
report
that
he
did
not
pray
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
think
that
if
the
erroneous
standard
was
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
--
it
wouldn't
be
proper
to
go
beyond
that.
we
have
here
the
decision
of
the
court
below
not
to
deal
with
and
if
that's
–-
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
if
the
record
was
fair
enough,
perhaps
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
reverse
then.
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
i
should
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
understand
that
and
i'm
suggesting
that
you
would
not
take
–-
you'd
be
in
the
position
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
without
reversing
it
in
the
hypothesis
that
you
–-
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
oh
the
standard
there
is
a
very
strict
one
insofar
as
scope
of
reviewed
--
review
is
concerned.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
if
there's
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
support
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
this
is
true
but
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
standard
under
the
estep
case
is
whether
there's
any
evidence
to
support.
but
of
my
position
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
in
the
first
instance,
i
suppose
it's
the
job
of
the
circuit
court
rather
than
this
court
to
make
that
review
in
the
posi
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
think
that
the
record
is
not
clear
in
this
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
there's
no
question
about
that
but
this
depends
--
excuse
me.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
absolutely.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
this
is
correct.
and
i
think
that
the
record
will
certainly
bear
that
out
in
the
nature
of
the
way
which
that
report
came
down
from
the
department
of
justice.
there
is
no
indication
there
that
they
were
doing
other
than
determining
that
britt
peter
had
no
belief
in
god
and
therefore
was
not
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
there
are
answers
to
that
question
which
go
to
the
practicalities
that
exist
in
the
department
of
justice
and
his
relations
to
the
other
sections
that
deal
with
these
matters
but
i
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
questions
which
we're
consider
immediately
prior
to
making
the
recommendation
and
the
department
of
justice
report
for
such
matters
“are
prayerful?”
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
on
page
37
of
the
record.
i'm
reading
about
halfway
down
the
paragraph
that
begins
on
bottom
of
page
36.
the
hearing
officer
reported
that
he
told
the
registrant
the
belief
in
the
supreme
being
was
required
and
that
no
time
to
the
registrant
suggests
that
he
had
a
belief
in
supreme
being
and
in
answering
and
hearing
the
officer's
question
“are
you
prayerful?"
the
registrant
had
stated,
“no,
i
don't
pray”
and
there
were
other
indications
in
the
report
which
deal
not
the
content
of
his
belief
but
rather
to
whether
he
was
sincere.
this
is
about
although
we
have
in
connection
with
the
content
of
his
belief
as
against
sincerity
in
that
report.
now
my
position,
i
want
to
have
it
absolutely
clear
is
that
this
record
does
not
permit
a
conclusion
no
matter
what
the
scope
of
review
is
that
this
individual
did
not
believe
in
some
kind
of
mysterious
power
beyond
the
obligations
of
man
to
his
fellowman.
i
would
like
to
finish
simply
by
stating
few
words
that
the
constitutional
question
which
is
reached
only
if
we
are
wrong
on
our
statutory
interpretation
question
is
somewhat
different
here
than
in
the
seeger
and
jakobson
case
if
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit's
view
is
that
section
6
(j)
requires
a
belief
in
the
deity.
and
that
is
the
narrower
concept
certainly.
and
the
constitution
i
think
would
come
into
play
far
more
quickly.
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
definition
there
would
--
the
broader
definition
of
--
of
supreme
being
which
has
been
advanced
by
the
government.
thank
you.
