another
way
of
putting
your
position
i
take
it
is,
that
there's
no
wrong
so
far
as
the
religious
clause
in
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
for
any
accommodation
in
terms
of
drawing
a
line.
justice

well
you've
made
that
in
the
free
speech
area.
justice

i'm
referring
to
barenblatt
and
other
cases
at
that
time.

federal
cases,
i'm
not
talking
about
fourteenth
amendment.
i'm
talking
about
federal
cases.
justice

harlan
but
that
isn't
the
government's
argument.
the
government's
argument
is
that
there
is
a
line
that
can
be
drawn
here
in
terms
of
the
definition
as
to
how
far
this
exemption
is
going
to
go
although
in
other
areas,
the
accommodation
might
not
be
a
permissible
one.
