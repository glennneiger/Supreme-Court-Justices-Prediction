mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
argue
this
case
on
the
basis
on
which
it
was
decided
in
the
lower
courts
and
not
on
the
assumptions
which
were
being
made
in
this
court.
in
the
first
place,
the
question
presented
here
has
been
not
correctly
stated
in
my
opinion
in
the
government's
brief.
i
have
here
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
government.
and
there,
it
seems
to
me
they
correctly
presented
the
question
which
was
in
these
terms
whether
in
granting
an
exemption
from
military
service
to
those
who
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
are
conscientiously
oppose
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
congress
could
constitute
and
limit
such
exemption
to
individuals
who
have
a
belief
in
a
relation
to
a
supreme
being
involving
duty
superior
to
those
arising
from
many
human
relation.
now,
i
have
restated
that
in
our
--
in
my
brief
and
that
to
my
mind
is
the
basic
question
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
the
hearing
officer
recommended
that
if
he's
given
an
exemption
on
the
basis
of
his
religious
training
with
the
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
and
the
department
of
justice
denied
exemption
solely
on
the
ground
that
he
did
--
that
he
was
not
religious
within
the
meaning
of
the
definition
in
the
section
6
(j).
now,
there
is
not
a
single
finding
throughout
any
of
these
agencies
or
courts
that
seeger's
belief
was
based
on
any
sociological,
political,
philosophical,
ethical,
or
in
personal
moral
ground.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
you
mean
the
kauten
case?
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
yes,
that's
right.
now,
the
stipulation
on
the
trial
was
that
his
conscientious
objector
is
sincere.
there
is
certainly
no
question
about
that.
this
whole
record
was
overlaid
with
sincerity.
and
it
was
predicated
on
religious
training
and
belief
as
been
found
and
defined
in
the
kauten
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
if
he's
attacking
the
definition
of
religion
in
the
kauten
case,
he
didn't
say
so.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
i
--
the
stipulation
was
that
religious
--
that
his
conscientious
objector
was
based
with
religions,
and
was
--
would
have
been
--
would
have
qualified
him
to
exemption
under
the
religious
training
and
belief
clause
of
the
1940
act
as
defined
in
the
kauten
case
and
in
the
downer
case
and
the
badt
case
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
never
been
challenged
up
to
this
time.
now
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
and
the
stipulations
are
all
a
matter
of
record
here.
i
have
the
record
and
i
have
such
a
brief
time
to
reply
to
an
hour's
argument.
i
prefer
now
to
go
to
these
stipulations
on
the
trial.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
here's
the
whole
brief
of
the
government
and
also
the
reply
brief
is
taken
up
for
this
argument
that
seeger
is
not
religious
and
that
the
contest
here
is
between
a
nonreligious
exemption
and
a
religious
exemption.
now,
that
is
not
the
issue
at
all.
the
issue
here
is
--
it
is
between
a
religious
objector
of
a
certain
character
who
has
one
concept
of
religion
and
the
question
of
whether
he
has
to
have
a
religion
based
on
a
relationship
to
a
supreme
being.
now,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
and
that
we're
not
in
this
case
so
far
as
seeger
is
concerned
on
the
matter
of
whether
exemption
should
be
given
to
nonreligious
people.
a
lot
of
itself
was
a
very
interesting
question
and
raises
some
important
constitutional
questions
but
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
can
make
a
law
which
distinguishes
between
people
who
believe
or
religions
which
believe
in
a
supreme
being
and
those
which
do
not
believe
in
a
supreme
being.
because
the
very
first
question
on
seeger's
questionnaire
which
he
had
answered
categorically
was
this.
do
you
believe
in
a
supreme
being?
answer,
yes
or
no.
now,
that's
the
only
choice
he
has.
and
he
put
a
third
box.
he
put
it
right
there,
he
crossed
the
third
box.
and
he
said,
the
belief
in
a
supreme
being,
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
cannot
be
proved
or
disapproved
and
therefore
i
would
prefer
not
to
answer
the
question
in
this
form,
but
this
does
not
mean
to
say
that
i
have
no
faith.
and
that's
right
in
his
record.
so
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
he
had
--
he
said
that
he's
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
now,
i
–-
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
i
think
he
--
i
think
--
now
you
got
back
into
the
kauten
case
again.
in
the
kauten
case
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
know
but
in
the
kauten
case,
they
define
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
this
man
is
conscientious
objection
is
based
on
a
religion
certainly
as
defined
in
the
kauten
case.
and
that
is
a
religion
which
says
that
conscience
in
a
sense
is
the
voice
of
god.
and
if
your
--
if
your
--
if
your
commitment
or
if
your
conscience
is
against
war
as
a
totality
and
not
against
a
particular
war,
and
it's
not
political
but
it's
a
matter
of
a
religious
impulse.
and
i
want
to
say
here
now
that
certainly
if
the
commitment
against
war
is
a
religious
impulse.
there
are
many
religious
groups
including
christianity
where
this
is
a
primary
tenet
of
their
faith.
blessed
are
the
peacemakers,
said
jesus.
love
your
enemies,
and
so
on.
and
he
was
held
into
this
world
with
his
angels'
peace
on
earth
to
fill
the
man.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
alright
he
believe
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
he
believes
in
peace,
again
he's
against
war
as
a
totality.
he
says
that
this
is
a
conscientious
objection
which
has
come
to
him
through
the
inner
recesses
of
his
mind
and
he
calls
it
conscience,
and
i
--
that's
exactly
what
he
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
based
on
many
things.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
he
--
i
--
if
i
have
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
sure
i
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
when
i
--
he
said
i
believe
in
and
devotion
to
goodness
for
its
own
sake
and
not
simply
because
it's
impelled
from
an
outside
source.
now,
that's
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
in
other
words,
he
didn't
--
he
doesn't
throw
a
line
between
a
--
a
compelled
from
the
outside
and
impelled
belief
from
the
inside.
that's
one
thing
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
the
congress
couldn't
do
with
all
the
distinction
between
those
things.
and
he
said
among
other
things.
however,
skepticism
or
disbelief
in
the
existence
of
god
does
not
necessarily
mean
lack
of
faith
anything
or
whatsoever.
the
(inaudible),
there's
sufficient
proof.
the
irony
and
skepticism
may
be
constituted
with
a
positive
faith.
the
action
taken
through
fear
of
god,
a
desire
for
external
reward
is
not
moral
conduct
but
expediency.
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
believe
in
goodness
for
its
own
sake
and
not
because
it
was
compelled
from
an
outside
source.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
he
said
he
--
it
couldn't
be
proved
and
it
couldn't
be
disapproved
and
therefore,
he
left
the
question
open.
now,
that's
--
if
that's
skepticism
and
thomas
jefferson
was
also
skeptic.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
it's
based
upon
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that
certainly
has
stipulated
that
he
did
not
claim
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
we
stipulate
when
he's
in
trial.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
our
statute
says
a
supreme
being
and
i'm
not
throwing
any
line
in
my
answer
to
you
about
that.
but
i
want
you
to
--
want
to
remind
the
court
that
that
means
monotheism,
it
doesn't
mean
any
polithe
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
it
says
a
supreme
being
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i'm
not
so
sure.
that's
polytheism.
but
the
government
wants
to
expand
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
to
cover
all
sorts
of
divinities
and
gods,
minor,
and
lesser,
and
--
and
spirits
apparently
although
it
don't
include
that.
and
the
question
is,
can
they
do
it
under
this
definition
of
--
because
this
definition
comes
from
a
case
where
they
acquitted
a
supreme
being
with
god,
one
god,
a
supreme
being.
and
that
comes
from
the
berman
case
definition,
comes
eventually
back
to
chief
justice
hughes'
definition
in
the
macintosh
case
where
he
said
that
religion
was
--
he
defined
it
as
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
or
god.
now,
the
question
here
--
yes,
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
would
say
that
that's
probably
true.
i
think
judaism
and
christianity
are
based
on
belief
in
a
single
supreme
being
basically.
but
i
don't
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
i
think
also
the
doctrine
of
–-
i
think
the
doctrine
of
brotherhood
of
man
doesn't
necessarily
and
fall
upon
the
belief
or
disbelief
in
the
supreme
being
however.
and
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
and
well
not
at
all,
his
definition
says,
i
have
a
conscience
which
is
--
which
i
think
is
--
which
in
the
words
socrates
is
my
voice.
and
this
is
the
thing
that
compels
me.
it's
not
something
from
a
god.
i'm
not
doing
it
under
force.
i'm
doing
it
pursuant
to
this
in
--
internal
compulsion
by
conscience.
now,
you
define
conscience
and
--
and
that's
what
the
court
tried
to
do
in
the
kauten
case.
it
said
this
is
a
religious
impulse.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
of
course
the
statute,
i
see
what
you
mean
but
the
statute
i
--
that's
why
i
called
your
attention
to
the
holding
of
below.
it
wasn't
based
on
this
moral
or
philosophical
ground.
it
was
based
solely
on
the
ground
that
his
belief
did
not
come
within
the
belief
of
the
supreme
being.
now,
this
--
this
raises
immediately
the
question
involved
in
the
torcaso
case.
can
congress
draw
a
line?
can
they
make
a
law
that
draws
a
line
between
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
of
that
concept
of
religion
and
one
that
doesn't
believe
in
that
--
in
that
kind
of
religion.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
would
say
to
answer
to
your
question
and
i
do
it
directly
as
this.
in
this
case,
if
congress
is
going
to
give
exemptions
to
religious
people
of
religious
training
and
belief,
then
they
got
to
give
exemptions
to
every
person
of
any
religious
training
and
belief.
they
can't
distinguish
between
one
type
of
concept
of
god
or
religion
and
another
type.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
i
would
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
would
--
i
would
probably
disagree
with
you
because
i
have
here
the
laws
of
the
united
--
of
all
of
the
countries
of
the
world.
and
at
least
10
countries
have
laws
where
they
--
where
they
exempt
conscientious
objectors
without
any
strings
attached
whatever.
and
in
switzerland
for
instance,
they
--
is
the
only
other
country,
the
rest
of
them
do
it
on
--
in
england
for
instance,
the
conscientious
objector
is
exempted.
and
the
only
question
is,
is
he
sincere?
now,
in
these
other
scandinavian
and
other
countries,
and
i
don't
think
i'd
leave
this
for
the
court,
the
same
thing
applies
in
all
of
those
draft
sections.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
yes,
i
will.
and
the
only
other
one
that
i
know
about
is
switzerland
where
they
allow
a
--
an
exemption
because
of
a
religion
or
moral
ground.
in
other
words,
it's
and
--
with
the
alternative.
now,
so
far
as
i
can
see,
the
peace
draft
act
and
these
other
draft
acts
were
very
successful
on
achieving
their
result.
the
only
question
was
the
man
sincere.
and
i
say,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
i
think
you're
wrong.
i
think
that
the
experience
is
not
so
at
all.
and
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
--
on
this
but
i
think
that
the
figures
show
that
there's
a
relatively
few
number
of
people
who
claim
conscientious
objection
status.
now,
if
they
are
recognized
as
a
conscientious
objector,
then
they
can
do
nonmilitary
work,
noncombat
work
but
they
can
do
civilian
work
if
the
authorities
give
them
permission
to
do
so.
but
until
they
get
non-conscientious
status,
they
cannot
get
into
these
categories
at
all.
that's
what
happened
to
seeger.
he
was
facing
a
prison
term
because
he
couldn't
reach
the
status
of
a
non-objector.
now,
there's
also
a
clause
in
the
act
that
will
permit
--
permit
this
court
to
knock
out
the
supreme
being
clause
and
preserve
the
rest
of
the
--
of
the
act
because
there's
a
separability
provision
in
the
1951
redraft
of
this
act
which
says
that
if
part
of
it
should
be
to
try
and
valid,
the
rest
of
it
will
still
stand.
so
that
this
act
could
come
back
to
the
point
where
it
was
in
1940,
allowing
for
military
training
and
belief
exemption.
now,
i'm
not
here
to
argue
the
question
as
to
whether
they
should
not
give
exemptions,
whether
they
should
give
exemptions
to
nonreligious
people.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
reach
that
point
nor
do
i
think
the
court
has
to
reach
that
point
but
whether
under
this
prior
decisions
of
that
court,
it
might
have
to
be
reached
sometimes
on
the
question.
because
i
don't
think
seeger
under
the
stipulations
in
this
case,
is
a
nonreligious
objector,
and
i
don't
think
the
government
can
put
him
in
that
category
ready
for
the
purposes
of
arguing
this
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
don't
have
any
definition
of
religion
but
i
say
that
there
are
many
definitions
of
religion
and
there
are
many
religions
that
do
not
believe
in
a
supreme
being.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
yes,
i
would
say
that
that's
true
too
that
there
--
for
instance
i'm
not
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
what
was
stated
yesterday
as
two
distinctions
between
these
religions
but
i
would
say
that
the
ethical
culture
society
and
i
remember
standing
at
this
place
in
the
zorach
case.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
to
me,
“mr.
greenawalt,
do
you
regard
the
ethical
culture
society
as
a
religion?”
i
said,
“i
don't
know.”
he
said,
“you
go
back
to
new
york
and
look
at
their
charter
and
see.
and
the
ethical
culture
society
is
chartered
under
the
new
york
religious
corporations
law.
and
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
religion
in
their
charter,
you
would
not
see
that
there's
any
sign
of
any
belief
in
divinity.”
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
i
wouldn't
know
whether
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
religious
or
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
i
would
say
that
that
man
was
not
sincere
if
he
told
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
it
is
not
religiously
sincere
because
conscience
does
not
say
that
bed
isn't
soft
and
that's
why
i
wouldn't
serve
in
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
do
you
say
you're
an
epicurean?
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i'm
not
sure.
as
i
read
the
history
of
epicureanism,
it
is
in
my
limit
to
say
i
was
there
--
it
wasn't
very
religious
but
i'm
not
so
sure
about
this.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that
it'd
be
better
but
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
if
it
were
religious
then
i
would
say
they
would
come
within
the
first
amendment,
yes,
and
if
it
could
come
within
that
definition
of
religion.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
this
statute
goes
a
line
between
two
types
of
religion
and
he
cannot
do
that.
i'm
not
trying
to
go
the
whole
game
--
gamut
of
religions
in
this
case.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
line
it
was
drawing
as
to
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
what
is
religion
but
must
it
be
related
to
a
supreme
being
belief
in
the
--
in
the
act
drawn
by
congress.
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
it's
whether
religion
can
be
defined
and
enshrined
by
congress
to
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
and
can
the
government
overlay
the
first
amendment
with
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being?
can
they
do
that?
does
that
mean
that
religion
in
the
first
amendment
means
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being?
and
if
that
so,
does
the
--
does
the
religious
test
in
the
clau
--
in
the
sixth
--
in
article
vi
means
that
you
don't
have
to
take
a
religious
test
except
that
you
do
have
to
take
a
test
that
you
believe
in
a
supreme
being?
if
that
--
if
that
is
the
law
of
this
country,
then
it's
been
somewhat
disregarded
because
i
think
that
we
have
had
public
officials
in
this
country
who
would
have
a
hard
time
defining
their
religion.
i
think
abraham
lincoln
was
one
of
them.
lincoln
never
belonged
to
a
church.
he
was
never
under
a
priest.
he
didn't
believe
in
any
articles
of
creed.
and
he
did
his
own
reading.
he
has
his
own
training
and
belief.
he
did
his
own
reading
and
old
jefferson
was
a
member
of
a
church.
he
barely
so
went
to
church
and
his
whole
philosophy
of
religion
or
religion
was
developed
from
his
readings,
and
so
on.
and
the
feast,
if
this
test
in
article
vi,
religious
test
has
to
be
related
to
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being,
then
nobody
could
be
an
officer
of
this
government
unless
he
takes
an
oath
that
he
believes
in
a
supreme
being.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
he
wouldn't
have
gotten
a
point
what
if
he
said
that
he
was
a
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
pardon,
mr.
justice
black,
i
didn't
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
you
mean,
is
there
a
different
rule
applying
in
the
notaries
as
there
is
to
a
soldier?
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
oh
i
see--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
oh
i
see
what
you
mean.
you
mean
under
this
clause
of
article
vi
of
the
constitution?
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
yes.
well
it
says
no
religious
test
shall
be
required
and
i
think
that
the
word
religion
in
clause
six
or
article
vi
has
to
be
also
related
to
the
term
religion
in
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
think
it
can
give
two
different
meanings
to
these
--
only
two
definitions
or
only
two
statements
of
religion
in
the
constitution.
now,
let
me
say
again
as
i
said
in
my
brief,
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
refers
to
god
or
a
supreme
being.
and
there's
only
two
usages
of
the
word
religion,
one
is
in
the
first
amendment
and
one
is
in
clause
--
in
article
vi
where
it
says
no
religious
test
shall
be
required
to
a
governmental
officer.
now,
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
religious
test
clause,
it's
certain
was
a
deliberate
part
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
that
a
man
should
not
have
to
believe
in
god
to
become
an
officer
of
this
government.
because
they
put
in
that
term,
no
religious
test
shall
be
required.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
yes,
it
applies
to
any
officer,
any
officer
of
trust
under
the
united
states,
that's
right.
and
i
can
conceive
of
a
--
if
congress
had
pass
a
law
of
saying
that
in
article
vi,
no
religious
test
shall
be
required
except
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being.
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
yet
that's
precisely
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case.
they're
saying
that
the
term
religion
means
in
the
first
amendment
that
there
has
to
be
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
before
it
can
be
applied.
and
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
i
think
that
the
term
religion
is,
in
my
brief,
i
cited
a
few
definitions
but
you
ask
me
to
define
religion,
i
can't
define
religion
any
more
than
--
than
you
can.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
have
defined
religion
and
the
government
i
might
say
in
their
brief
here.
i
think
this
is
rather
a
distinct
admission.
seeger's
views
are
religious
as
some
careful
thinkers
and
writers
used
the
term.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
down
a
little
bit
further
that
these
beliefs
are
religious
in
the
definitions
here
they
are.
one
of
seeger's
views
although
is
religious
as
some
psychologist
and
theologians
used
the
term,
nevertheless,
they
are
not
religious
within
the
meanings
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
if
there
are
theologians
that
define
religion
on
the
terms
of
seeger's
belief,
how
can
this
court
or
congress
say
that
it
doesn't
include
that
kind
of
religion?
i
don't
understand
that.
is
--
was
jefferson
right
when
he
says
that
legislatures
are
not
--
legislators
are
not
in
infallible?
that's
what
he
said.
these
infallible
people
can't
determine
or
these
fallible
people
can't
determine
what
shall
be
the
religions
of
our
country
here.
and
my
point
in
this
case,
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
argue
this
thing
in
--
in
the
terms
that
i'd
like
to
argue
or
even
to
reply
to
the
to
the
government's
brief
but
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing
about
the
government's
brief.
seeger
belongs
to
no
organized
sect,
follows
no
ritual,
knows
no
catechism,
acknowledged
no
scriptures,
worsips
not
in
a
church
or
temple
and
follows
no
priest.
now,
that
covers
a
lot
of
people
including
mr.
lincoln.
if
the
quakers
don't
have
any
–-
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
he
certainly
did.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
but
the
quakers
don't
have
any
catechism.
they
don't
have
any
ritual.
i've
been
to
a
quaker
meeting
myself
where
i
sat
there
for
an
hour
and
not
a
word
was
said.
and
they
--
we'll
walk
in
and
walk
out
without
a
word
being
said.
now,
is
that
not
a
religious
meeting?
i
thought
it
was
a
very
religious
meeting.
no
church
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
he
didn't
said,
mr.
just
--
he
didn't
quite
said
that.
he
said,
“i
can't
prove
it
and
i
can't
disapprove
it.”
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
leave
the
question
open.
he
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
no,
he
didn't
say
that.
he
said
i'm
an
agno
--
he
said
in
effect,
“i'm
an
agnostic.
i
can't
prove
it
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
no,
i
don't
agree
with
you.
there
was
an
--
a
former
sect
in
this
country
called
the
seekers
and
they
kept
their
minds
open
until
they
finally
decided
where
they
were
going.
and
i
think
seeger
is
in
the
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
he's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
he
didn't
say
he
didn't
believe
in
a
divinity.
he
said,
“i
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
divinity
or
not.”
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
he
said
i
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
not
unless
you
call
it
conscience
of
divinity
which
i
like
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
in
the
kauten
case,
they
did.
and
i
think
that
that's
where
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
they
didn't
call
it
a
divinity.
they
called
it
a
--
they
say
he
--
they
equated
conscience
judge
hand
with
the
voice
of
god.
now,
it's
not
a
divinity
on
the
sense
that
it's
a
--
an
outside
other
worldly
divinity
but
it
is
an
inner
compulsion
which
most
of
us
don't
know
where
it
comes
from
but
it
comes
to
it
just
like
socrates
didn't
know
where
the
demon
ruled
and
came
from
but
at
least
it
was
a
religious
impulse.
that's
what
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
my
time
expires,
i
think
i
probably
--
i
have
five
minutes.
of
course,
i
haven't
had
chance
to
review
this
case
in
the
context
to
which
i
wanted
to
but
my
brief
is
rather
complete.
i
say
that
this
law
violates
the
establishment
clause
because
it
does
give
official
approval
to
one
type
of
religion
or
one
concept
of
religion
as
against
another
concept
of
religion.
and
it
--
and
it
punishes
directly
or
indirectly
the
person
who
does
not
accept
the
concept
set
forth
in
that
law.
it's
an
official
government
sanction
of
a
particular
concept
of
religion.
and
i
say
it
violates
the
free
exercise
clause
too.
and
i
say
that
that's
even
clearer
because
the
government
says
in
its
brief
many
times
that
these
exemptions
are
given
because
they
want
to
protect
the
free
exercise
of
those
people
who
were
covered
by
these
exemptions.
in
my
reply
to
that,
if
that
is
so,
what
happens
to
the
people
who
are
religious
but
who
do
not
come
within
this
definition
of
religion?
what
about
their
free
exercise?
and
i
say
that
the
seeger's
free
exercise
is
also
prohibited
in
this
case
--
this
doesn't
mean
to
say
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
exemption.
i
recognize
that
congress
doesn't
have
to
give
exemptions.
i
would
even
recognize
that
they
might
limit
those
exemptions
to
religious
people
although
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
but
i
do
say
that
once
they
give
exemptions,
once
they
give
a
benefit,
once
they
give
an
exemption,
once
they
give
a
privilege,
then
they've
got
to
apply
the
equality
rule.
they've
got
to
be
equal
as
between
the
people
who
are
getting
the
benefits
as
you
said
in
the
speiser
case
and
also
in
the
sherbert
case.
and
i
go
one
step
further.
i
say
this
is
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
here
was
the
classification
of
religions
not
raised
as
it
was
in
the
bolling
case
but
of
religions
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
first
amendment.
and
therefore
the
due
process
clause
and
the
embodiment
of
the
equal
protection
clause
which
is
in
the
fifth
amendment,
becomes
vey
clear
in
relation
to
the
first
amendment
because
there
you
have
an
exact
definition
of
what
congress
can't
do.
and
therefore
you're
not
rela
--
you
don't
have
to
fall
on
the
broad
definition
of
due
process.
now,
finally
i
say
that
the
selective
draft
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
well
i
think
that
case
was
wrongly
decided.
it
was
based
on
a
different
statute.
i
don't
think
congress
has
a
right
to
exempt
only
those
who
belong
to
duly
constituted
religions.
but
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
point
here.
i
simply
say
the
case
doesn't
apply.
now,
to
come
back
to
the
point
of
what
is
religion
of
the
constitution,
i
think
religion
in
the
constitution
has
to
cover
all
kinds
of
religion.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
cover
acts
which
are
not
religious.
i
don't
misunderstand
it.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
cover
acts
that
are
not
religious
simply
because
somebody
says
they're
religious.
but
i
think
it
covers
all
sincere
religious
beliefs
whether
they're
based
on
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
or
not.
and
i
don't
believe
the
congress
has
a
right
to
draw
a
line
which
was
not
drawn
in
the
constitution
in
relation
to
the
protections
and
the
benefits
of
the
first
amendment
by
distinguishing
between
theistic
and
nontheistic
religions.
and
i
think
that
the
government
--
now
unless
this
court
wants
to
overturn
the
definition
of
religion
in
the
kauten
case.
i
think
the
case
have
been
tried
and
decided
on
the
theory
that
this
man
is
religious
under
the
terms
of
religion
in
the
kauten
case.
if
you
don't
agree
with
that,
then
of
course,
then
he's
not
--
maybe
he
isn't
religious.
i
don't
know.
but
as
long
as
he
got
that
definition
in
here,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
got
to
say
the
judge
hand
was
wrong
in
his
definition
of
religion
in
the
kauten
case.
because
i
think
seeger
definitely
comes
into
that
religion
and
the
--
and
the
government
has
so
stipulated.
finally,
i
want
to
say
that
i
didn't
have
the
chance
to
refer
to
some
of
the
statements
made
in
the
argument
yesterday,
but
i
was
upset
by
this
statement
that
people
--
that
history
for
instance.
now,
history
doesn't
prove
that
congress
was
right
here
at
all.
i've
gone
through
all
the
statutes
from
the
first
statute
of
massachusetts
and
i
quoted
the
one
from
the
first
statute
in
rhode
island
to
my
brief.
there's
not
a
single
statute
of
exemption
which
defines
religion
in
terms
of
a
distinction
between
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
and
a
belief
in
not
a
supreme
being.
the
statutes
for
the
most
part
give
an
exemption
for
religions
or
maybe
specific
religions,
but
they
don't
define
the
term
religion
in
terms
of
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
so
there's
no
president
here,
just
for
this
particular
statute.
this
statute
derives
from
judge
--
chief
judges
hughes'
definition
of
religion
in
the
macintosh
case
which
was
adopted
in
the
berman
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
there's
where
this
thing
has
its
origin.
and
the
question
now
is
whether
this
court
is
going
to
overlay
or
embody
in
the
first
amendment
a
limited
concept
of
religion
which
is
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being.
and
i
say
if
you
do
it,
you
are
going
to
exclude
not
only
65
million
americans
who
are
non-church
goers
and
who
do
not
belong
to
any
religious
sects
or
whatever,
and
do
not
recognize
priest,
and
do
not
go
to
meetings,
and
to
have
no
formal
religious
training
at
all.
the
books
will
tell
you
that
that's
the
number
--
over
45%
of
americans
who
belong
to
no
church,
no
organized
religion.
they're
going
to
be
excluded
on
the
--
on
the
definition
of
religion
and
say
nothing
of
these
many
people
who
are
members
of
primitive
or
oriental
groups
who
have
different
religious
beliefs
than
that.
i
personally
think
that
mr.
seeger
is
a
very
religious
man
and
i
think
that
he's
religious
in
the
same
sense
essentially
that
some
of
our
great
statesmen
who
are
religious
that
is,
they
have
a
sense
of
religion
which
is
not
compelled
by
a
god
who's
going
to
say,
“if
you
do
this,
you're
going
to
be
punished
and
if
you
don't
do
this,
you're
not
going
to
be
punish
or
you're
going
to
get
some
afterlife
benefits
if
you
do
this,
and
so
on.”
he
believes
in
religion
in
the
sense
that
he
wants
to
think
that
goodness
should
be
related
to
this
life
and
to
the
conscience
which
is
compelling
him
to
do
these
things.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
absolutely
correct
in
this
position
that
congress
cannot
draw
this
kind
of
a
line
under
the
constitution.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
there's
no
--
there's
no
room
for
an
accommodation
that
draws
a
line
between
concepts
of
religion
or
types
of
religion,
yes
your
honor.
now,
whether
there's
room
for
an
accommodation
that
draws
a
line
between
religion
and
non-religion,
i
think
is
a
different
question.
and
i
think
that's
not
the
question
involved
in
this
case
but
it
could
be
argued
and
i
said
in
my
brief
that
it
was
--
there
are
other
statutes
and
other
countries
where
they
don't
draw
this
religious
line.
but
i
say
under
the
first
amendment,
they
cannot
draw
lines
between
different
types
or
concepts
of
religion.
that's
my
--
my
point.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right
and
there's
not
a
single
finding
in
any
of
the
administrative
boards
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
that's
one
of
the
questions
but
i
also
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
think
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
think
if
you
--
if
he
use
throughout
the
definition
of
religion
in
the
kauten
case,
that
mr.
seeger
might
have
justified
his
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
if
you'll
examine
the
record
carefully,
you
see
that
i
reserve
the
right
to
state
that
his
viewed
covered
other
than
the
definition
of
religion
in
the
kauten
case.
in
other
words,
i
accepted
their
admission
but
i
didn't
say
that
was
--
it
wasn't
confined
by
it.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
they
referred
--
they
said
the
government
was
very
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
they
did
say,
however,
that
the
government
frankly
had
conceded
that
his
views
were
religious.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
--
not
possibly,
it's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
i'm
aware
of
the
conflict
between
members
of
the
court
whether
the
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
whether
it's
an
absolute
or
whether
(voice
overlap)
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
don't
know
what
case
you're
referring
to.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
certainly,
in
the
schempp
case
and
in
the
sherbert
case
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
i
would
--
my
answer
to
this
is
i
don't
think
that
congress
can
accommodate
one
group
of
religious
people
as
against
another
group
of
religious
people.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
whether
those
cases
are
rightly
decided
or
not,
i
don't
know
but
i
would
say
this,
the
government
cannot,
the
congress
cannot,
in
my
opinion,
accommodate
under
the
exemptions
of
the
draft
act
those
who
believe
in
one
type
of
religion
and
against
those
who
don't.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
perfectly
clear
because
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
overlay
the
first
amendment
with
the
belief
in
a
supreme
being.
i
don't
think
you
can.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
is
he
what?
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
he
certainly
is
not.
i
must
say
that
my
first
connection
with
mr.
seeger
was
with
the
american
friends
service
committee.
i'm
a
non-quaker
member
of
the
american
friends
service
committee.
and
he's
working
with
the
american
friends
service
committee
so
that
i
think
he's
--
i
had
up
here
which
i
am
very
glad
to
leave
the
court.
he
said
in
his
--
he
said
in
his
dissertation
that
he
had
been
greatly
influenced
by
this
pamphlet
called
speak
truth
to
power.
now,
this
is
a
quaker
publication.
it's
written
on
a
religious
basis.
if
you're
interested
in
seeing
this
thing,
i
would
gladly
leave
it
with
the
court.
but
this
is
--
he
said,
i
have
been
greatly
influenced
by
this
pamphlet
which
is
a
religious
pamphlet,
so
that
his
views
are
very
close
to
quakerism,
although
he's
not
formally
affiliated
with
the
quaker
group.
he
really
works
for
their
friends,
the
american
friends
service
committee.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
would
say
it's
not
a
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
court
neither
mr.
seeger
nor
i
have
any
connection
whatever
with
any
communist
organization
but
i
had
been
the
chairman
of
the
bill
of
rights,
president
of
the
bar
association.
i'm
very
sensitive
to
these
questions.
now,
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
a
rational
line
or
not.
i
do
think
it's
an
arbitrary
line
and
i
think
it's
a
classification
which
is
invidious
under
terms
of
the
first
amendment.
now
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well,
that
is
the
fifth
amendment
too.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
it's
both.
i
think
it's
an
invidious
classification
under
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
would
--
the
government
raised
these
questions.
whether
they
have
to
exactly
conform?
and
they
said
it's
immaterial
whether
they
exactly
conform.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
and
i
say
they
should
exactly
conform
with
the
first
amendment
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
whatever
his
religion
under
the
first
amendment,
they've
got
to
conform
to
that.
yes,
that's
my
position.
now
what
is
not
religion
under
the
first
amendment,
is
another
story.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
would
say
either
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
no,
it
doesn't
have
to
cover
(voice
overlap).
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
so
far
as
the
first
--
the
first
part
of
the
first
amendment
that
i'm
talking
about,
the
religious
clauses,
i
say,
it
protects
religious
beliefs.
i
wasn't
talking
about
other
terms.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
should
like
to
argue
that
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
think
this
has
been
an
interesting
argument.
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
my
case
though.
my
case
here,
it
has
to
do
with
the
distinction
between
religious
beliefs
and
not
the
distinction
between
nonreligious
belief
and
religious
beliefs.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right,
it's
under
that
too.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
it's
under
that
too.
it's
under
all
of
them.
it's
under
both.
and
if
you
read
my
brief
carefully,
you'll
see
why
it
is.
because
if
the
exemptions
to
religious
people,
as
the
government
says,
is
in
exercise
of
their
--
is
to
in
--
to
give
them
their
free
exercise
of
religion.
i
say
the
government
cannot
give
the
free
exercise
to
a
religion.
there
are
certain
groups
of
people
who
are
religious
and
not
give
it
to
the
other
people
who
are
religious.
and
this
isn't
because
any
of
them
were
entitled
to
exemptions.
but
because
once
they
give
it
to
some,
they
can't
give
it
--
take
it
away
from
other.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
that's
part
of
it.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
don't
know.
this
is
a
–
this
is
a
field
–-
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
say
they
almost
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
say
that
once
they
give
it
to
any
religious
group,
they
got
to
give
it
to
all.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
i
think
you're
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
i
want
to
say
that
my
argument
does
not
go
that
far.
my
argument
does
not
say
that
government
could
not
take
that
exemption
away
from
religious
people.
i
simply
say
once
they
give
it
to
some
people,
it's
a
denial
of
the
free
exercise
of
the
people
who
they
don't
give
it
to
who
were
religious.
that's
what
i'm
saying
that
they
--
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
no,
possibly,
that's
the
way
i'm
phrasing,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
that's
right,
they
did.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
well
it's
very
(voice
overlap)
it's
a
very
distinct
case
and
i'll
take
i
under
any.
mr.
kenneth
w.
greenawalt
but
the
travel
in
this
case
is
that
the
questions
are
far
more
interesting
on
the
application
of
those
questions.
i
think
they're
really
very
interesting
questions
of
law
here.
