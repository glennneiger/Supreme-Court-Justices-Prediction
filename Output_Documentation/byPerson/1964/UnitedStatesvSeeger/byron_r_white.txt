justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
you
say
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
seeger's
views
are
religious
or
not
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
issue
was
really
precluded
by
stipulations
in
the
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
find
in
the
record
if
you
referred
to
is
that
there's
a
stipulation
by
mr.
friedman
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
orally
in
the
court
which
indicates
that
if
you
accept
that
review
in
kauten
then
seeger's
views
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
are
religious,
but
isn't
that
really
the
question
as
whether
you're
going
to
accept
kauten
or
are
you
aren't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
it
is
a
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
is
an
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
seeger's
views
are
religious
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
(voice
overlap)
religion
it
just
means
you're
throwing
out
your
--
you're
reexamining
or
not
reexamining,
we
haven't
ever
reexamine
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
second
circuit
didn't
--
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit,
it
doesn't
go
on
the
assumption
where
there
is
no
issue
about
whether
seeger's
views
are
religious
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
second
circuit
accepted
--
frankly
they
--
the
proposition
that
yes
there
is
an
issue
here
about
whether
seeger's
views
are
religious.
and
we've
got
to
decide
first
whether
they're
religious
or
not.
if
we
decide
they're
religious,
then
we
have
the
question
of
equal
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
said
was
that
the
government
has
frankly
conceded
that
his
views
are
religious
if
you
accept
the
views
of
the
kauten
case,
if
you
accept
the
definition
of
religion
in
the
kauten
case.
and
that's
what
judge
kaufman
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
judge
kaufman
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
justice
stewart's
question
was
does
any
exemption
have
to
cover
every
belief,
not
only
religious
belief,
but
other
beliefs
that
are
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that
was
his
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
based
on
the
fifth
amendment
rather
than
the
first
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standard
was
employed
in
the
administrative
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
really
the
relevant
inquiry,
isn't
it,
whether
what
standard
was
employed
at
that
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assume
we
--
let's
assume
we
decided
the
ninth
circuit
to
employ
the
wrong
standard
at
the
administrative
level,
the
right
standard
doesn't
employ
then
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
decision
of
the
administrative
level.
what
then
reverse?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
--
the
question
is
the
validity
of
the
decision
of
the
administrative
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standard
do
we
use
in
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
administrative
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
inquiry
here
then
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
wrong
standard.
you
want
us
to
turn
to
make
an
independent
review.
now,
so
and
–
and
our
approach
then
could
be
whether
or
not,
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
administrative
decision,
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
said
that
--
you
said
the
--
you
suggested
that
you
want
us
to
go
ahead
and
make
the
independent
examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
nevertheless
the
standard
we
use
in
the
proceeding
with
that
examination
of
the
record
is
to
determine
whether
there's
any
evidence
at
all
to
support
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
assume
that
the
department
of
justice
at
that
stage
took
a
different
view
of
what
the
--
of
what
that
section
meant
than
the
department
of
justice
has
not
taken.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
but
you
may
assume
that
so
i
--
but
the
answer
was
--
you
said
the
only
concrete
evidence
is
the
standard
they
use
and
the
department
of
justice
is
what
now?
