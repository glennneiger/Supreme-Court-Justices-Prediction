mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
since
the
next
three
cases
all
involved
provisions
of
the
selective
service
act
relating
to
conscientious
objectors,
the
court
approved
in
an
arrangement
between
counsel
that
i
should
present
the
government's
opening
argument
in
all
three
cases
in
one
piece,
and
at
then
each
of
the
opposing
parties
would
have
an
opportunity
to
reply
with
respect
to
his
case.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
all
three
cases
do
raise
basic
questions
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
the
provisions,
relating
to
conscientious
objector,
whereas
two
of
them
also
present
separate
questions
concerning
the
interpretation
or
application
of
the
statute.
i
shall
argue
the
seeger
case
first
and
devote
the
great
bulk
of
my
time
to
it,
because
it
does
present
the
basic
constitutional
issue,
which
is
the
one
with
which
we
are
the
most
concerned.
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
provides
as
we
all
know,
for
drafting
young
men
into
the
armed
forces
as
needed
for
national
defense.
generally
speaking,
the
obligation
is
universal,
although
the
provisions
for
deferment
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
vital
occupations.
section
6
(j)
of
the
act
provides
for
special
treatment
of
a
defined
class
imprecisely
and
i
may
say
misleadingly
known
as
conscientious
objectors.
conscientious
objectors
as
defined
in
section
6
(j)
are
not
exempt
from
national
service.
they
are
subject
either
to
service
and
noncombatant
capacities
or
to
other
important
national
service
as
determined
by
local
draft
boards
under
regulations
issued
by
the
president.
those
who
are
not
subject
to
combatant
service
are
defined
in
section
6
(j).
the
relevant
portions
of
which
are
printed
on
page
two
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
seeger
case,
number
50
in
the
fattest
of
the
briefs.
it
provides
for
an
exemption
from
combatant
training
and
service
of
anyone
who
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
define
what
is
meant
by
the
belief
part
of
religious
training
and
belief.
and
it
means,
the
statute
says,
an
individual's
belief,
in
relation
to
a
supreme
being,
involving
duties
superior
to
those
arising
from
any
human
relation,
but
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophically
views
or
merely
personal
moral
code.
the
affirmative
part
of
definition
could
be
read
doubtless
with
emphasis
upon
supreme
being
so
as
to
require
something
which
perhaps
i
might
best
describe
as
a
fundamentalist
god.
we
adopt
a
more
liberal
interpretation,
having
in
mind
not
only
the
diversity
of
religions
in
this
country,
but
also
the
fact
that
such
eminent
theologians
such
as
professor
tillich
and
dr.
robinson,
the
anglican
bishop
of
willich
defined
the
--
construe
the
idea
of
the
personal
god
and
defined
god
in
such
terms
as
the
ultimate
ground
or
root
of
our
being.
as
we
read
the
statute,
therefore,
it
does
not
require
belief
in
any
particular
kind
of
god.
the
emphasis,
we
think,
is
between
the
contrasts
on
the
one
hand
between
the
human
duties
that
arise
on
between
men
solely
from
their
relation
to
their
fellows.
and
on
the
other
hand,
duties,
as
the
statutes
put
it,
superior
to
those
arising
from
any
human
relation.
the
essence
we
think
is
the
dichotomy
between
transcendent
or
divine
obligations
and
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophically
views,
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.
it's
plain
that
seeger's
beliefs,
fall
in
the
later
half,
the
nonreligious
half
of
this
dichotomy.
the
court
will
read
his
own
statements.
“to
me,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
emphasize
four
points
about
them
that
standout."
first,
seeger's
objection
to
serving
in
the
armed
forces
was
we
agree,
sincere
and
conscientious.
he
pairs
to
have
reached
his
conclusions
after
study
and
reflection.
second,
seeger
plainly
did
not
believe
in
a
god
or
gods,
however
defined.
now,
in
duties
transcending
the
obligations
that
arise
among
men,
simply
the
fact
--
from
the
fact
that
we
are
in
a
human
society
together,
he
rejected
as
pure
expedience
--
i
mean
that's
his
words,
actions
taken
through
fear
of
god,
and
said
that
he
had
more
respect
for
the
nobler
pagan
spirit
of
antiquity,
but
for
a
belief
in
--
belief
in
and
devotion
to
goodness,
and
for
their
own
sake,
and
to
a
purely
personal
ethical
code.
third,
i
would
say
that
seeger's
philosophy
did
contain
a
sense
of
obligation.
he
spoke
rather
movingly
of
the
duty
of
a
person
to
give
his
life
meaning
by
relating
constructively,
i
think
he
put
it,
to
the
human
surroundings
in
which
he
lived.
fourth
and
most
important,
seeger's
opposition
to
war
is
overwhelmingly
political.
political
in
the
sense
that
it
is
directed
to
the
kind
of
things
that
the
government
must
consider
in
determining
of
whether
to
require
universal
military
service
in
determining
what
is
its
policy
toward
defense
would
be
and
what
its
foreign
policy
would
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
apparently,
yes.
i
think
the
part
of
the
tumble
with
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
in
the
word
religion
which
has
so
many
meanings.
and
if
i
may
just
finish
the
point
i
was
making,
i
then
going
to
direct
myself
i
think
to
that
direct
point.
i
was
emphasizing
that
i
would
say
it
was
political
and
philosophical,
that's
a
conclusion.
but
i
do
emphasize
that
his
concern
as
he
put
it,
was
with
the
welfare
of
humanity
and
the
preservation
of
democratic
values.
from
that
standpoint,
he
argued
that
the
preparation
for
war
was
wrong.
the
philoso
--
the
philosophy
behind
the
arms
race
is
that
military
preparedness
will
deter
aggression.
by
arming
ourselves
and
we're
not
provoking
others
to
arm,
was
not
this
process
--
was
it
not
this
process
that
led
to
war
in
the
past.
sooner
or
later
resentment
and
anger
will
outstrip
fear
and
war
will
break
out.
and
those
are
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
their
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
they're
part
of
their
argument
if
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
politically.
i
should
try
to
emphasize
here.
indeed,
the
essence
of
my
case
is
almost
the
proposition,
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
one
starts
at
one
end.
and
it
can
describe
things
that
are
purely
political.
and
one
can
describe
at
the
other
end
things
that
we
would
all
agree
were
clearly
religion.
and
in
between
the
two,
there
is
this
continuum.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
--
i
wouldn't
argue
that
the
congress
could
do
anything
to
affect
this
man's
belief,
to
prevent,
to
interfere
with
any
rituals,
to
prevent
any
proselytizing,
anything
that
has
to
do
with
the
holding
of
beliefs
or
the
observance
proselytizing
of
beliefs.
i
say
that
this
is
a
case
dealing
with
secular
canon.
also
again,
and
i
do
not
want
to
get
too
far
ahead
of
myself
because
this
is
a
terrible
tangle
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
again,
i
think
that
this
is
dilemma
that
to
provide
at
all
for
the
opportunity
for
men
to
follow
their
religion
in
this
area,
the
definition
of
those
who
are
exempt
has
to
be
couched
in
the
terms
of
belief,
the
terms
which
we
would
of
course
much
rather
not
have
secular
legislation
deal,
but
that
that
is
one
of
the
dilemmas,
that
congress
was
entitled
to
take
into
account.
now,
all
i'm
saying
-
seeking
to
emphasize
here
without
--
i
don't
really
mean
to
characterize
seeger's
argument
too
much.
i'm
trying
to
state
what
it
was.
and
the
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
it
is
in
terms
primarily
of
the
wisdom,
of
policy
decisions,
the
wisdom
of
defense,
the
wisdom
of
war.
he
argued
in
his
statement
the
first
two
world
wars
failed
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy.
and
world
war
iii
is
not
likely
to
be
more
successful.
war,
he
said,
was
self-defeating.
not
only
because
of
the
slaughter
of
innocent
people
but
because
it
inevitably
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
the
democratic,
social,
and
political
values
for
which
our
society
stood.
it
is
in
terms
of
social,
political,
perhaps
philosophical,
and
yes
humanitarian
objectives.
now
so
of
our
many
things,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
are
religious.
but
i
think
that
i
would
argue
that
what
is
--
that
the
center
of
religion
at
least,
remember
that
we're
dealing
with
shades
of
conduct,
it
hold
has
something
more
than
those
purely
humanitarian
arguments
to
it,
something
that
belongs
to
the
realm
of
the
spirit,
something
other
than
reason,
something
reaching
deeper
than
reason
usually.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
with
all
respect,
that
that's
quite
an
impossible
interpretation.
the
language
in
the
statute
came
from
mr.
chief
justice
hughes'
dissenting
opinion
in
the
macintosh
case,
and
both
have
it.
and
there
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
contrasting
political
and
sociological,
philosophical
views
in
a
much
broader
sense
in
the
judgment
as
to
the
particular
war.
second,
i
think
it
has
to
be
born
in
mind
that
this
particular
part
of
the
definition,
the
later
part
of
section
6
(j)
was
to
put
in
following
some
judicial
interpretations
in
the
selective
service
act
of
1940.
now,
when
the
selective
service
act
of
1940
was
enacted
going
beyond
the
old
conscientious
objector
section
of
the
world
war
i
statute,
two
kinds
of
arguments
were
presented
to
congress.
the
old
exemption
have
been
confined
to
what
i
may
put
in
members
of
the
peace
churches.
one
had
to
be
a
member
of
a
sect
that
taught
objection
to
war
in
any
form.
there
was
trouble
defining
what
was
a
sect.
the
primary
argument,
however,
i
would
say
as
i
read
the
hearings
before
the
congress
and
they
were
very
long
hearings,
was
that
it
was
felt
that
this
was
unfair
to
the
people
of
known
religions,
where
the
religion
did
not
teach
opposition
to
war
as
part
of
its
creed,
but
where
that
individual
as
part
of
his
religion
nevertheless,
have
felt
the
sincere
opposition
to
war.
then
another
line
of
argument
that
was
presented
was
that
anyone
who
was
conscientiously
opposed
to
war
should
be
exempted.
and
it
seems
quite
clear
that
when
congress
spoke
of
religious
training
and
belief
that
it
was
attempting
to
take
care
of
the
first
class
and
not
the
second.
but
even
if
that
should
be
wrong,
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
that
view.
the
government
had
always
accepted
that
view.
the
second
circuit
apparently
had
departed
from
it.
even
if
that
should
be
wrong,
congress
clearly
put
this
language
in
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
rejecting
the
second
circuit's
view
and
accepting
the
ninth
circuit's
view.
so
there's
a
matter
of
interpretation.
i
really
think
this
means
political
in
a
broad
sense
as
it's
shown,
i
submit
to
you,
by
the
--
by
the
context
that
associates
political
with
philosophical,
political
philosophy.
it
associates
it
with
socio
--
sociological,
which
surely
is
not
directed
simply
at
a
single
war.
or
a
personal
moral
code
of
which
again
could
hardly
be
directed
in
that
direction.
if
i
were
to
try
to
sum
up
seeger's
views
in
the
sentence,
i
would
say
that
he
felt
a
strong
conscientious
obligation
to
act
and
live
by
his
political
opinions,
even
to
the
point
of
resistance
to
the
duly
constituted
civil
authority.
now,
i
do
come
to
the
point
that
was
raised
about
the
use
of
the
term
religious.
it
seems
to
me
that
some
confusion
arises,
mr.
justice
stewart,
from
the
fact
that
religion
--
religious
is
being
used
here
in
a
lot
of
different
senses.
i
think
the
facts
may
be
fairly
stated
in
this
way.
it
was
stipulated
at
the
trial
that
some
theologians
whom
seeger
might
call
as
witnesses
would
testify
that
his
views
were
religious
within
the
meaning
of
the
definition
in
the
old
second
circuit
kauten
case
that
was
rejected
by
the
amendment
of
the
section
6
(j).
and
of
course,
we
stand
by
that
stipulation
that
some
theologians
would
have
so
testify.
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
usage,
there
are
people
who
use
the
word
religious
in
a
way
that
encompasses
seeger's
views.
second,
whether
seeger's
views
are
religious
in
the
sense
in
which
the
word
is
used
in
the
constitution
is
a
matter
of
argument.
well,
that
depends
of
course,
not
only
on
how
you
characterized
seeger's
views
but
on
how
one
interprets
the
term
religion
or
free
exercise
thereof
in
the
constitution.
third,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
opposed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we
would
get
lost
if
we
get
into
that
right
now.
i
don't
mean
to
be
rude
but
this
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
third,
i
think
there
is
agreement
and
certainly
we
argue
that
seeger's
views
are
not
religious
within
the
meaning
of
section
6
(j).
and
i
would
try
to
keep
the
sense
in
which
i
used
the
term
religious
clear.
i
shall
try
to
use
it
always
unless
the
context
shows
otherwise
in
the
sense
in
which
it
shows
in
the
statute,
and
not
in
some
of
the
other
sense.
now,
in
saying
that
seeger's
views
are
not
religious,
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
it.
we're
in
an
intensely
difficult
area
here.
it's
intensely
difficult
for
the
civil
authorities
to
require
any
men,
which
he
conscientiously
feels
that
he
should
not
do.
but
this
is
a
problem
after
all,
as
congress
faces
it
and
as
the
draft
authorities
face
it,
that
deal
with
awful
choices.
we're
talking
about
the
life
and
death
perhaps
of
an
entire
nation,
of
an
entire
civilization.
and
i
think
what
congress
has
essentially
tried
to
say
in
section
6
(f),
and
what
we
say
it
has
the
right
to
say
is
it
when
one
is
in
that
kind
of
area
making
these
awful
choices,
then
congress
has
the
right
to
say,
“so
long
as
your
argument
is
that
we
are
going
about
preserving
democratic
values,
western
civilization,
and
the
ideals
of
american
life.
so
long
as
your
argument
is
in
those
terms,
then
the
community
has
the
right
to
set
its
judgment
after
consideration
ahead
of
yours.
unhappy
as
it
may
be
that
someone
must
be
forced
to
act
in
a
way
that
his
reason
tells
him
he
shouldn't
act.
but
if
the
argument,
that
the
objector
made,
is
transported
to
another
realm,
if
it's
in
a
--
i
would
use
the
adjective
“higher
realm”.
but
if
it's
in
a
different
realm,
if
it's
in
the
realm
of
faith,
of
the
spirit,
of
the
divine,
transcendent,
then
the
congress
says,
“we
can't
argue
with
you
and
we
recognized
your
scoop.”
and
our
argument
simply
is
that
congress
has
the
right
to
recognize
that
division,
shady
as
the
lines
may
often
be,
and
that
congress
has
the
right
to
make
a
choice
that
draws
a
line
provided
that
it
addresses
itself,
solely
to
drawing
the
line
in
terms
of
seeking
to
promote
religious
freedom.
now,
i
want
to
say
a
word
if
i
may,
about
the
question
presented
here,
because
it's
intensely
important
that
we
be
clear
as
to
just
what
the
question
in
this
case
is.
since
seeger
does
not
fall
within
the
exemption,
granted
by
section
6
(j),
he
as
far
as
to
argue
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
draft
him
for
combatant
service
while
exempting
those
who
are
opposed
to
war
because
of
what
are
religious
reasons
within
the
statute.
the
argument
i
take
it
is
that
he
is
the
victim
of
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
that
can
be
avoided
so
long
as
those
who
are
within
the
section
6
(j)
are
exempted,
only
by
exempting
him
also.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
agree
--
well
i
think
if
the
exemption
was
only
for
precedence,
i
would
agree
that
a
catholic,
a
jew,
so
on
could
raise
the
question.
i
am
not
sure
that
seeger
could
raise
the
question.
indeed
this
is
the
part
that
i
am
seeking
to
emphasize
that
we
are
not
concerned
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no
not
seeger.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
understand
that
he
is
not
a
communicant
today
which
is
what
i
meant.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
i
think
seeger
might
show,
mr.
justice
douglas
discrimination
against
him.
that
it's
not
enough
for
him
to
argue
that
this
statute
discriminates
against
buddhists
with
gods.
but
it
discriminates
against
the
ethical
culture
society.
if
it
does,
that
the
court
can't
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
in
rem,
especially
since
its
meaning
depends
so
much
on
its
application.
and
that
seeger
must
therefore
show
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose
so,
yes.
also
when
you're
standing
in
different
senses,
i
say
it
goes
to
whether
any
constitutional
right
of
his
has
been
taken
away
as
distinguished
from
standing
to
sue.
now,
that's
what
i
was
seeking
to
keep
separate.
so
what
--
so
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
did
not
--
i
didn't
think
it
was
necessary,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
there
are
so
many
cases
one
could
put.
i
think
that
what
would
have
to
go
into
buddhism
in
some
detail
and
he
would
as
i
have
for
what
i
know
about
it
have
to
understand
the
views
of
the
particular
buddhist.
i've
quoted
a
statement
of
buddhism
in
the
footnote
in
my
reply
brief
that
would
suggest
to
me,
speaking
simply
and
intellectually
and
i
don't
know
but
we've
had
no
cases
that
we
can
we
discover.
but
i
would
think
that
a
buddhist
might
well
qualify
under
the
statute.
i
would
think
that
a
buddhist
or
a
member
of
the
ethical
culture
society
might
be
able
to
make
a
very
different
constitutional
case
than
seeger
assuming
that
the
statute
as
interpreted
does
not
include
it
which
i
--
i
don't
assume,
i
have
no
bases
either
in
the
rulings
that
have
been
made
as
best
that
i've
been
able
to
discover
them
and
they're
not
--
not
an
ibm
machine
or
in
anything
i've
been
told
that
a
buddhist
would
be
excluded.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
the
class
here
that
seeger
would
represent,
would
be
a
class
whose
views
are,
in
my
words,
essentially
political
or
sociological,
a
class
which
does
not
claim
any
of
the
indicia
of
religion
in
the
sense
of
worship,
in
the
sense
of
belonging
to
a
flat,
adhering
to
a
creed,
acknowledging
a
catechism,
any
organized
religion,
any
moral
code
that
others
adheres
to.
all
of
those
things
seem
to
be
to
be
indicia
of
religion.
and
that
really
the
problem
we're
dealing
with
in
a
sense
is
how
much
of
what
you
have
that
we
all
would
call
religion,
which
religion
in
the
traditional
conventional
said,
may
be
taken
away
and
you
still
have
religion
left.
now
in
seeger,
you
have
a
quiet
different
problem
with
than
you
would
have
with
the
buddhist
or
anyone
else.
so
that
i
say,
i
don't
think
it's
just
in
terms
of
standing
to
sue,
i
thinks
it's
in
terms
of
the
differentiation
between
seeger
and
others,
is
not
an
constitutional
differentiation
against
him
now
that
maybe
that
there
are
other
unconstitutional
differentiations.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
have
the
key
of
the
emphasis
that
i
would
put
on
the
statute.
i
don't
mean
to
rid
supreme
being
out
of
it.
the
key
of
the
emphasis
that
i
would
put
on
the
statute
is
the
difference
between
duties,
as
we
know
each
other
just
because
we
are
in
the
community
and
duties
which
to
me,
transcendent
or
divine
that
go
--
reach
over
and
above
of
human
relationship.
another
way
putting
it
which
i
try
to
suggest
was
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
the
government
debates
so
that
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
suffer
over
when
they
have
to
make
these
decisions
about
defense
or
war
and
peace,
and
the
kind
of
question
that
belongs
in
a
different
realm.
now,
those
it
seems
to
me
are
poles
apart.
and
that
the
heart
of
the
problem
here
results
from
the
fact
that
they
are
poles
apart.
the
way
i
plan
to
approach
the
constitutional
issue,
the
substance
of
it,
and
the
way
i
find
that
gets
most
quickly
into
the
heart
of
it
is
by
looking
at
this
problem
of
what
to
do
about
conscientious
objector
loosely
speaking,
as
it
faces
the
congress
or
a
legislator
because
that
forces
you,
thinking
about
the
constitution
as
well
as
what
ought
to
be
done
but
looking
at
it
prospectively
rather
in
--
than
in
arrears,
because
that
forces
you
to
really
face
up
to
the
hard
questions.
but
other
course
that
congress
might
have
followed
would
be
less
subject
to
the
objections
made
here.
what
is
it
about
this
statute
in
terms
of
what
could
be
done
that
is
unconstitutional?
now,
i
started
looking
at
it
that
way
with
three
things
that
seem
to
me
to
be
facts.
one
is
that
the
american
people
from
long
before
we
became
an
independent
nation
has
believed
that
there
are
some
men
usually
members
of
the
peace
churches,
who
should
not
be
ordered
to
fight
of
because
this
would
require
them
to
disobey
what
they
believe
to
be
the
revealed
commands
of
their
god,
of
the
doctrines,
or
perhaps
being
the
epitome
of
that
class
of
people.
and
we
have
always
felt
that
some
such
allowance
should
be
made
of
--
that
a
man
who
took
that
position,
if
he
didn't
fight
as
he
wouldn't,
should
not
be
put
in
jail.
second,
it
seems
to
me
there's
also
a
fact
that
in
the
absence
of
conscription,
men
would
have
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
they
should
not
go
into
the
army
or
perhaps
the
farthest
over
on
the
--
toward
to
pull
away
from
the
dunkard
that
we
need
to
go
is
the
man
who
reason
on
simply
practical
terms
that
defense
and
war
are
always
self-defeating,
in
practical
terms,
that
the
damage
to
human
welfare,
of
the
wealth,
on
the
opportunities
that
are
lost
in
war
never
can
be
equaled
by
the
games
from
war.
therefore
as
a
purely
material
political
man,
one
should
never
fight
any
war.
the
third,
i
suggest
as
i
have
before
us,
argued
by
the
petitioner,
that
between
those
two,
there
is
what
i've
called
the
continuum.
that
one
shades
into
the
other
or
that
the
views
in
between
have
indifferent
degrees,
different
elements
and
different
combinations
of
each
element
of
belief.
and
that
you
really
can't
tell
where
one
divides
into
the
other.
now,
given
those
facts,
it
seems
to
me
that
three
conclusions
inescapably
follow.
first,
that
although
a
sec
--
selective
service
act
that
deals
with
secular
conduct,
there
is
no
escape
for
framing
any
classification
and
easing
the
plight
of
any
conscientious
objector
in
terms
of
opinion
or
belief.
you
just
can't
appoint.
congress
might
exempt
no
one
and
override
all
objections
including
the
deepest
religious
objections
and
those
based
most
clearly
on
revealed
command.
it
might
exempt
to
everyone
who
have
some
reason
that
he
personally
thought
he
didn't
want
to
or
shouldn't
serve
in
the
armed
forces.
congress
can
go
a
good
way
to
eliminate
the
differences
as
indeed
it
has
done
because
it
requires
everyone
to
give
some
national
service
and
for
--
and
during
war
has
taken
everyone
out
of
his
home
in
civilian
intern.
but
under
any
course,
it
takes
any
account
of
religious
objectives
to
war.
it
must
frame
the
exemption
in
terms
of
a
man's
opinion
or
beliefs.
and
i
suppose
that
raises
the
initial
constitutional
question,
does
the
first
amendment
prohibit
congress
from
classifying
men
for
military
service
on
the
basis
of
their
belief,
religious,
or
otherwise.
we
think
the
answer
is
plainly
that
the
congress
may
provide
for
such
classification,
where
necessary
to
accommodate
the
demands
of
religious
liberty,
to
the
needs
of
national
defense.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
contrary
argument
based
as
they
are
in
the
briefs
on
the
quotations
from
prior
opinions
to
the
effect
that
congress
may
not
differentiate
between
religion
and
nonreligion,
or
may
not
differentiate
between
religions,
all
are
too
broad
and
too
undifferentiated.
they
failed
to
note
the
very
different
context
which
mr.
justice
douglas
has
suggested
already,
in
which
those
words
are
uttered
and
the
differences
between
that
case
and
this
one.
now,
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
set
out
three
categories
and
i
simply
want
to
refer
to
them
very
briefly.
first,
where
legislation
or
other
governmental
action
challenged
under
the
first
amendment,
attempts
to
punish
or
regulate
beliefs
or
ritual
or
the
professional
beliefs,
then
of
course
the
widest
possible
scope
is
given
to
the
protection
and
the
widest
possible
scope
may
be
given
to
the
word
religion.
here,
the
aim
after
all,
is
to
guarantee
people
freedom
of
mind.
to
guarantee
each
man
his
own
cosmology,
his
own
philosophy
in
life,
his
own
right
to
profess,
his
own
right
to
proselytize,
his
right
to
do
those
things
about
what
might
say
the
subject's
doubt
within
religion.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
his
belief
is
religious
or
nonreligious.
indeed
it's
been
suggested
and
i
think
the
very
sound
basis
that
since
the
first
amendment
protects
other
forms
of
opinion
is
really
no
need
when
you're
dealing
with
this
area
of
belief
as
such
for
proselytization,
or
profession
the
area
dealt
within
barnette,
the
area
dealt
within
torcaso,
then
there
is
no
occasion
really
to
distinguish
between
what's
religion
and
what
are
some
other
form
of
belief.
now,
it
rests
i
submit
even
within
exemption
for
conscientious
objectors
falls
in
a
quite
different
area.
it's
secular
legislation.
it
deals
with
secular
conduct
resulting
from
beliefs.
secular
conduct
of
course
may
conflict
with
religious
liberty,
either
because
it
requires
conduct
inconsistent
with
the
teachings
of
religion,
as
was
true
in
sherbert
v.
verner,
or
in
the
prince
case,
or
the
old
jakobson
case
on
vaccination,
or
because
government
regulation
in
conjunction
with
the
observance
of
one's
religious
beliefs,
the
soothing
conduct
of
the
belief
results
in
some
kind
of
economic
loss
that
is
in
braunfeld
and
brown.
but
the
court
has
always
recognized
a
difference
between
legislation
that
attempts
to
intrude
into
the
field
of
beliefs
as
such,
or
professions,
or
proselytization
and
legislation
that
regu
--
that
deals
with
the
secular
conduct
resulting
from
beliefs.
and
while
congress
is
absconded
to
its
power
in
the
latter
area,
it's
not
at
all
uninhibited.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
is
a
great
deal
broader
than
it
is
in
the
areas
like
those
in
torcaso
and
barnette.
now
the
second
category
of
cases
of
course,
the
court
at
bar
in
the
second
category
perhaps
in
many
other,
deals
with
support
of
religion
or
involvement
of
the
government
in
religion
in
one
form
or
another.
i
questioned,
as
we
have
in
our
reply
brief,
whether
the
field
that
from
which
the
government
is
excluded
here,
is
as
broad
as
it
is
where
you're
dealing
with
the
problem
like
torcaso
or
barnette.
there
are
many
things
that
are
called
by
some
people
to
be
religious,
which
i
can't
believe
the
government
may
not
aid
or
support
or
be
involved
in.
for
example
it
is
said
that
ethics
is
religion,
but
surely
one
of
the
functions
of
our
schools
is
to
convey
from
one
generation
to
the
next
some
of
the
basic
ethical
principles
of
the
community.
this
case,
however,
whatever
may
be
the
merit
of
that
suggestion,
this
case
does
not
involve,
in
any
meaningful
sense,
support
for
religion.
to
say
that
the
constitution
requires
congress
to
ignore
religious
beliefs
in
imposing
secular
duties
that
conflict
so
directly
with
the
teachings
of
religion
as
an
order
to
engage
in
combat,
in
violation
of
what
the
man,
the
individual
believes
is
the
command
of
his
--
the
literal
command
of
his
god
not
to
kill.
it
goes
way
beyond
any
meaning
that's
ever
been
put
on
the
establishment
clause.
and
to
give
such
an
exemption,
i
suggest,
is
not
in
any
sense
to
aid
religion.
the
act
deals
here,
this
act,
deals
with
the
beliefs
of
man
as
facts
neither
encouraging
them
nor
discouraging
them.
indeed
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
just
as
congress
concluded,
that
it
was
inhuman,
harsh
to
require
a
son,
all
of
whose
brothers
had
been
killed
in
the
service
to
be
drafted,
was
so
cruel
to
his
family,
so
here
there
was
a
similar
feeling
that
given
a
man
who
would
be
put
in
jail
for
disobeying
the
command
of
his
god
was
a
lack
of
humanity.
it
should
have
showed
you
compassionate
exemption
and
one
to
of
course
aim
at
promoting
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
i
think
the
contrary
argument
makes
much
to
light
of
religious
faith,
alright.
it
asserts
that
the
people
of
conscientious
objector
are
going
to
take
on
or
give
up
their
beliefs
because
of
the
differences
it
perhaps
stated.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
think
anyone
simply
by
his
assignment
to
one
form
of
national
service
or
another
is
likely
to
be
influenced
at
his
beliefs.
in
the
second
place,
the
act
makes
it
very
clear
through
the
test
of
sincerity
that
anyone
who
takes
on
a
--
what
he
calls
a
religious
belief
or
from
that
motivation
of
course
would
be
given
a
1-a
and
not
a
1-o
classification.
now,
i
do
acknowledge,
of
course,
that
there
is
some
difference
in
treatment
between
anyone
exempted
from
combatant
service
or
at
one
drafted
through
combatant
service.
and
i
suppose
there
are
those
who
would
regard
one
as
in
advantage
over
the
other.
if
there
were
any
way
of
avoiding
that
difference
of
treatment,
it
would
seem
quite
possible
that
the
first
amendment
would
require
congress
to
avoid
it.
but
here
we
come
up
to
what
i
think
is
the
second
of
the
hard
realities
of
this
case
of
the
insoluble,
inescapable
dilemmas.
and
that
is
that
you
cannot
treat
the
one
who
is
exempted
and
you
cannot
treat
the
religious
objector
like
the
man
who
has
no
religious
objections
and
still
provide
for
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
there
just
isn't
any
way
it
could
be
done.
either
you're
going
ahead
classifying
differently
because
of
his
faith
and
his
desire
to
pursue
these
conducts
to
his
faith,
or
you're
going
to
ignore
this
faith.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
i
really
hadn't
quite
come
to
that
point,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
shall
indeed.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
here
was
simple
that
if
one
is
going
to
provide
for
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
he
must
treat
the
religious
objector
somewhat
differently
from
the
general
run
of
the
community.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
he
must
draw
the
line
between
religious
objectors
and
nonreligious
objectors.
i
did
mean
to
suggest
that
he
must
draw
the
line
in
terms
of
belief
and
i
intend
to
dwell
on
that
a
little
bit
further.
but
my
point
now
is
that
simply
to
the
extent
that
there
is
in
this
classification,
anything
that
can
be
called
aid,
advantage,
benefit,
i
don't
think
it
can
fairly
be
called
support
but
anything
of
that
kind
for
religion
or
for
conscience
if
it
was
driven
and
drafted
in
those
terms,
that
it's
inescapable,
that
there
is
no
way
of
not
making
some
difference
according
to
beliefs.
now
this
--
this
is
very
important
in
terms
of
answering
the
arguments,
that
you
can't
treat
religion
differently
from
nonreligion
as
it
is
important
in
treating,
entering
the
argument
you
can't
treat
two
religions
differently,
because
it's
inescapable.
if
you're
going
to
do
anything
for
the
free
exercise
of
religion
here,
that
there
will
be
some
differentiation
between
people
according
to
their
beliefs.
now,
that
much
differentiation,
we
think
congress
has
done
everything
possible
to
reduce
it,
that
much
differentiation,
we
think,
is
permitted
or
justified
even
though
not
required
by
the
problem
of
accommodating
the
free
exercise
clause
with
the
other
requirements
of
the
first
amendment.
and
on
this
point,
it
seems
to
be
that
the
precedent
shows
very
clearly
that
we
are
right.
those
most
closely
in
point
of
course
are
the
decisions
beginning
with
the
selective
draft
cases
in
245
u.s.
where
the
court
sustained
a
narrower
exemption
than
the
present
one
both
against
the
argument
that
it
improperly
favored
religion
as
against
nonreligion,
and
against
the
argument
that
it
improperly
favored
are
the
peace
churches
or
members
of
the
peace
churches
against
those
whose
individual
religious
belief
was
opposed
to
war
in
any
form
but
who's
created
--
but
whose
church
did
not
adhere
to
such
faith.
those
cases
have
been
cited
with
approval
in
a
number
of
recent
opinions
in
this
court.
we've
gathered
them
and
quoted
from
them
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
they
include
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
sunday
blue
laws
cases.
also
the
opinion
i
think,
or
the
opinions
i
think
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
sunday
blue
laws
cases.
again
in
the
--
in
the
schempp
case,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
goldberg
suggest
very
strongly
that
congress
may
grant
exemptions
from
secular
legislation
where
necessary
to
accommodate
the
requirements
of
the
secular
legislation
to
the
free
exercise
of
religious
belief.
sherbert
and
verner
certainly
would
seem
to
support
that
proposition
indeed
it
seems
to
hold
that
under
some
circumstances
that
may
be
a
requirement,
a
constitutional
requirement
and
not
just
something
permissible.
and
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
white,
clearly
recognizes
although
they
held
that
it
was
not
a
constitutional
requirement,
that
there
is
some
leeway
for
accommodation
by
the
legislature
or
the
congress
in
working
out
this
kind
of
the
accommodation
of
between
the
demands
of
religious
freedom
and
in
this
case
the
needs
of
national
defense.
now,
i
come
to
a
point
i've
already
alluded
to
several
times
but
i
like
to
deal
with
it
more
precisely.
the
third
inescapable
fact,
if
one
asks,
what
can
congress
do
in
this
area?
the
third
inescapable
fact
that
confronts
anyone
facing
that
question,
i'm
seeking
to
allow
for
the
free
exercise
of
religion
in
relation
to
military
conscription
is
that
wherever
the
line
is
drawn,
the
any
exemption
or
classification
will
have
to
involve
inescapably
fine
shadings
of
belief.
and
really
the
question
here
i
think
when
you
come
down
to
it,
is
whether
the
first
amendment
leaves
some
room
for
congress
to
decide
where
the
line
should
be
drawn
between
the
fine
shadings
of
belief,
or
whether
the
court
or
because
the
constitution
requires
it
is
going
to
hold
that
it
must
draw
that
line.
now,
the
polar
cases
as
i've
said
before
are
relatively
easy
to
deal
with
but
no
one
has
any
trouble
distinguishing
between
that
about
18th
century
quaker,
or
the
mennonite,
the
dunkard
and
others
on
the
one
hand,
and
those
who
object
to
military
conscription
on
the
ground
that
building
up
the
national
defense
will
lead
to
further
building
up
and
mobilization
on
the
other
side
that
eventually
this
will
lead
to
war
and
that
all
war
is
defeating
in
humanistic
terms.
the
problem
is
that
these
two
merged
into
each
other.
now,
where
is
the
line
between
religion,
conscience
and
disinterested
political
or
economic
judgment?
is
the
test
one
of
the
stubbornness
of
belief
of
its
source,
of
its
ultimate
justification?
where
do
political
and
economic
policy
break
off
and
philosophy
begin?
and
where
does
philosophy
break
off
and
religion
begins?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
yes.
and
i
agree
in
substance
with
you,
your
honor,
and
i
think
i
understand
and
was
going
to
make
a
little
later
the
point
that
i
understand
you
to
suggest.
i
think
the
great
fallacy
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
and
in
the
arguments
of
counsel
here,
is
the
failure
to
recognize
that
wherever
the
line
is
drawn,
there
will
be
cases
on
opposite
sides
of
it,
which
differ
only
in
degree
at
which
other
persons
might
put
in
a
different
category
because
they
give
somewhat
different
scope
to
the
terms
ethics,
philosophy,
political
or
religious.
i
think
that
in
this
area
the
very
simple
and
attractive,
i
must
acknowledge
proposition,
that
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
prohibit
any
differentiation
between
forms
of
religion,
is
itself
too
undifferentiated.
it's
supposed
too
broad
and
too
narrow.
it's
much
too
narrow
as
applied
to
the
area
that
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
as
the
first
amendment
question
where
you're
really
regulating
a
belief.
it's
much
too
narrow
when
you're
dealing
with
support
for
religion
in
the
sense
of
engel
or
schempp
with
that
problem
regardless
of
the
result.
but
it's
much
too
simple,
too
broad
when
you
come
to
this
problem
of
classification.
it
really
is
a
gross
i
submit
with
reference
to
the
court
below
and
the
counsel,
a
gross
over
simplification
to
pretend
that
the
line
between
what
is
religion
and
what
is
not
religion,
it
vows
no
shadings
of
degree.
and
to
pretend
that
there
are
no
relevant
differences
in
terms
of
this
problem
between
what
might
be
termed
by
some
definitions
to
be
religion.
and
then
i
would
go
on
as
we
have
in
our
brief,
to
raise
the
question
whether
it
helps
very
much
to
approach
the
problem
in
terms
of
religion.
you
will
find
in
some
of
the
briefs
amicus
a
great
many
different
definitions
of
religion.
the
psychologists,
sociologists
have
a
definition.
the
fundamentalists,
the
18th
century
--
19th
century
church
had
very
different
definitions.
and
some
theologians
have
moved
towards
the
definition
of
the
psychologists,
others
have
remained
fundamentalists.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
for
the
court
to
choose,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggests,
between
one
of
those
definitions
of
religion
and
to
say
that
that
is
the
constitutional
religion
was
far
more
an
interference
with
what's
really
important
in
the
first
amendment
but
for
the
court
to
say,
that
the
congress
may
make
a
careful,
non-invidious
classification,
closely
related
to
permissible
aims.
now,
of
course
it's
suggesting
the
congressmen
make
a
classification
of
resulting
from
differences
in
belief
i
hasten
to
add
that
it
must
be
very
closely
scrutinized
so
that
there
will
not
be
the
kind
of
difference
that
mr.
justice
douglas
mentioned
before.
so
there
will
be
no
suggestion
why
we
like
catholic
and
we
don't
like
buddhist
or
catholics
have
so
many
hundred
thousand
votes
and
the
very
few
buddhists
are
sent
to
hawaii.
that
kind
of
difference
of
course
violates
the
standards
of
due
process
established
by
the
fifth
amendment
especially
when
it's
read
in
conjunction
with
the
first.
our
argument,
i
hope
and
certainly
is
not
intended
to
contain
any
suggestion
that
there's
to
be
a
difference
based
upon
on
some
kind
of
an
invidious
classification,
or
based
upon
judgments
concerning
the
orthodox,
the
truth
of
what
a
man
beliefs,
not
truth
of
whether
he
believes
it
but
the
abstract
truth
of
what
he
believes,
or
based
upon
some
notion
of
the
word
with
different
views.
that's
all
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
didn't
--
i
really
didn't
intend
to
address
myself
to
any
other
line
of
differentiation
with
this
one.
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
the
selective
service
act
of
--selective
draft
act
of
1968
or
1978
did
come
close
to
making
a
line
between
organized
religion
and
unorganized
religion.
and
the
court
held
unanimously
that
that
was
constitutional,
i
don't
intend
to
disavow
that.
i
don't
have
that
case,
but
i
don't
intend
for
a
moment
to
disavow
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
agree
that
he
uses
the
word
religious,
that
he
says
he
is
religious,
and
counsel
says
he
is
religious.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
points
i'd
like
to
suggest,
your
honor.
one,
without
meaning
to
quibble,
he
doesn't
say
that
is
his
belief.
he
says
he
has
more
respect
for
it.
second,
remember
as
the
case
comes
here,
the
question
as
what
to
draft
board
might
have
concluded
about
his
beliefs,
and
not
how
we
would
interpret
because
he
doesn't
have
to
take
everything
exactly
at
face
value.
third
what
i'm
arguing,
i
could
see
that
as
a
better
usage
many
people
would
denominate
his
beliefs
religion
but
nor
as
i
said
earlier
i'm
not
quite
sincere
about
this.
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
his
conscience
or
his
beliefs.
he's
--
depressed
by
and
he's
quite
a
fellow
unhappily,
providing
for
the
national
defense
can
be
inconsistent
with
that.
but
i
don't
think
what
i
am
suggesting
is
whether
somebody
would
call
this
religious
or
not.
in
some
sense
of
the
term,
isn't
decisive,
that
if
the
question
that
congress
had
the
power
to
say
as
i
have
tried
to
argue,
that
this
involves
drawing
a
line.
this
question
involves
shadings
from
one
view
into
another
of
what
are
easy
to
separate.
and
that
if
congress
draws
the
line
for
secular
purposes,
and
solely
either
in
terms
of
secular
differences,
or
for
the
purpose,
mr.
justice,
of
attempting
to
separate
out
what
is
religious
as
we
would
all
agree
by
any
definition,
from
what
is
political
or
philosophical
or
sociological
as
we
would
all
agree
from
any
definition,
by
any
definition.
but
if
it
is
addressing
itself
to
that
and
that
if
the
line
it
draws
can
be
justified
in
terms
of
that
objective,
then
it
doesn't
introduce
a
lot
of
other
invidious
things,
then
we
say
that
it
is
not
prohibited
even
by
the
first
or
fifth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
confess
i
don't
understand
that,
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
say,
i
don't
want
to
fight,
i
have
a
duty
to
bring
up
my
children
and
i
regard
that
as
a
transcendent
duty.
no,
i
don't
put
that
in
terms
of
religion.
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
from
my
unwillingness
to
take
a
bribe
as
to
the
position
the
solicitor
general
would
take
in
this
court
or
whether
he
will
let
91
days
go
by
before
he
files
a
petition
for
certiorari.
i
--
somewhere,
the
line
has
to
be
drawn.
i
really
don't
think
you
escape
it
by
introducing
the
word
conscience.
i
also
would
say
that
we
know
certainly
a
sharp
difference
between
of
what
is
conscience
and
what
is
religious.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
don't
think
so
really
for
two
reasons.
first,
i
think
even
the
line
in
terms
of
conscience,
if
you
think
about
it,
is
a
line
in
terms
of
beliefs.
it's
a
line
that
has
to
do
with
people's
state
of
mind.
you
would
simply
move
it
farther
out
away
from
what
we
would
all
call
religion.
but
it
still
remains
a
line
based
on
something
subjective.
second,
i
think
that
it
goes
beyond
anything
that
can
be
fairly
called
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
that
religion
does
mean
something
other
than
conscience.
the
illustrations
that
occurred
to
be
is
it
clearly
would
be
against
if
i
don't
mean
to
be
rude,
but
clearly
be
against
the
conscience
of
any
justice
of
this
court
to
let
the
substance
of
a
decision
be
known
before
the
opinion
day
on
monday,
to
friends
or
to
induce
paper
reporter
or
to
anybody
else.
i
can't
relate
that
to
religion
and
equally
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
there
are
many
cases
in
which
they
tend
to
become
the
same
thing.
all
i
am
again
saying
is
that
these
things
do
tend
to
run
together,
as
it
is
inescapable
that
someone
draws
a
line.
but
i
think
that
at
one
end
of
conscience,
that
one
end
of
religion,
they
are
virtually
separate
as
day
and
night.
i
think
we
all
know
men,
there
are
many
things
they
wouldn't
do
because
of
conscience.
but
who
of
themselves
would
say,
that
they
attributed
no
religious
significance
to
it.
now,
i
don't
--
i
think
congress
could
have
drawn
the
line
clearly
the
other
way,
mr.
justice.
it
might
be
that
if
arrive
where
the
congress
we
would
draw
the
line
and
where
the
british
drew
the
line.
i
don't
say
this
is
the
only
line
that
could
be
drawn.
i
say
that
this
is
a
constitutional
line.
i
say
that
it
is
a
reasonable
workable
line.
the
arguments
that
we
make
as
part
of
that
proposition
are
developed
at
some
lengths
in
our
belief.
i
spent
so
much
time
trying
to
show
that
one
is
free
to
take
them
into
account
that
there
really
isn't
time
to
develop
them
here.
but
you'll
recall
first
there
the
argument
of
history
shows
that
this
is
a
reasonable
line.
that
this
is
a
line
between
religion
and
conscience,
if
i
may
use
those
terms
as
been
one
of
various
forms
of
conscription
have
made
throughout
our
history.
occasionally,
you
find
conscience
used
in
early
statutes.
i
strongly
suspect
that
it
meant
religious
conscience
but
i
have
nothing
to
show
one
way
or
the
other.
but
the
line
nearly
always
has
been
in
terms
of
religion.
i
suggest
second,
that
this
has
over
the
years
through
two
world
wars,
through
korean
period,
and
the
intensely
difficult
period
of
a
drastic
peace
talks
approved
a
pretty
workable
line
both
in
the
sense
that
it's
been
administrable,
and
in
the
sense
that
both
those
drafted
and
their
families
that
all
seem
to
have
found
it
pretty
acceptable.
we
say
for
a
third
thing
that
this
line
does
take
care
of
what
seems
to
be
at
the
pole
of
what
is
clearly
religion
and
to
be
drawn
in
terms
that
has
applied
to
one
like
seeger,
do
tend
to
differentiate
some
place
of
penumbra
whether
you
call
it
religion
of
nonreligion.
and
finally
i
think
it
is
significant,
we've
argued
this
at
more
length
in
our
brief,
that
the
definition
of
religion
in
the
statute
conforms
very
closely
to
what
has
been
our
national
sense
of
what
is
religion
down
through
history.
the
court
has
often
said
that
we
are
a
religious
people
whose
institutions
presupposed
a
divine
being.
i
take
that
it
means
divine
being
only
in
the
--
somewhat
in
the
sense
certainly
today
that
i
have
used
it.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
if
the
legislation
was
trespassing
in
the
people's
belief
or
profession,
or
that
if
it
had
to
do
with
some
part
for
religion
that
in
a
national
conscientious
would
justify
that
of
course,
nor
indeed
do
i
suggest
that
this
is
the
only
justification
here
because
this
would
come
to
a
difference
that
it
might
exclude
buddhists
and
some
other
strange
sect.
what
i
do
say
is
that
along
with
the
other
considerations,
that
it
is
relevant
to
take
into
account
that
the
law
that
touches
so
many
people,
so
many
millions
of
people
so
imminently,
closely
and
so
fearsomely
at
many
times
in
our
history
that
the
national
understanding
of
what
constitutes
religion
would
certainly
affect
congress
could
take
into
account.
now,
i
plan
to
go
on,
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
may
to
the
second
of
these
cases,
the
peter's
case.
the
constitutional
arguments
that
i
have
made,
apply
equally
to
the
peter's
case
which
i
shall
argue
next,
and
to
the
jakobson
case,
the
third
of
these
cases.
i
have
no
intention
of
repeating
it.
i
shall
devote
my
self
now
simply
to
the
separate
issue
in
each
of
these
other
two
cases.
peter
first
registered
with
this
local
--
i
should
have
said
one
thing
more.
peter
claims
that
he
falls
within
the
definition
of
the
exemption
in
section
6
(j),
that
is
his
opposition
to
war,
is
based
upon
belief
in
a
supreme
being
involving
duties
superior
to
the
duties
that
arise
out
of
human
relationships
and
it's
that
point
that
i'm
going
to
address
myself
to
it.
peter
first
registered
with
this
local
draft
board
while
a
student
at
reed
college.
he
did
not
claim
at
that
time
to
be
a
kind
of
conscientious
objector.
but
a
year
later,
when
he
filled
out
a
standard
questionnaire
form
the
draft
board,
he
submitted
a
poem
expressing
opposition
to
war
even
then
he
didn't
claim
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector.
in
february
1958,
he
voluntarily
withdrew
as
a
student
at
reed
college.
and
within
a
bearing
of
few
days
or
few
weeks
if
not
few
days
thereafter
since
he
had
lost
or
having
lost
his
student
deferment,
he
requested
forms
that
he
might
express
his
conscientious
objection.
the
draft
board
denied
the
classification
and
after
a
hearing,
it
reaffirmed
his
denial
of
the
1-a
classification.
peter
appealed.
there
was
the
usual
fbi
investigation,
a
hearing
that
he
and
two
witnesses
attended
before
a
hearing
officer.
a
report
recommendation
by
the
department
of
justice
and
ultimately
his
draft
board
voted
again
to
deny
conscientious
objector
status.
out
of
those
materials,
they've
emerge
a
sketch
of
peter's
life
and
belief,
that
i
want
to
summarize
very
briefly.
peter's
family
had
no
religious
affiliation
and
he
was
not
brought
up
in
a
religious
background.
as
a
high
school
student
he
had
been
introspective
and
exceedingly
independent.
and
some
of
his
teachers
testified
that
if
he
ever
reached
the
conclusion,
that
it
was
morally
wrong
to
kill
there
would
be
no
doubt
about
having
the
perseverance
to
be
a
conscientious
objector.
he
then
went
to
reed
college,
where
he
left
a
reputation
for
good
moral
character
but
deficient
scholarship.
he's
never
been
very
good
student
apparently.
he
withdrew
from
reed
as
i
have
said
in
february
1958,
and
immediately
thereafter,
having
then
lost
the
deferment
as
a
student,
requested
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector.
after
leaving
college,
he
lived
--
rather
bohemian
existence
apparently
in
san
francisco.
most
of
it
in
the
cust
--
in
the
company
of
(inaudible).
he
was
interested,
i
would
guess
in
a
rather
unsophisticated
untutored
way
in
music,
art,
and
poetry.
he
worked
for
bree
spells
(ph)
once
as
a
hall
man,
once
as
a
photographer's
assistant,
once
as
a
temporary
clerk
at
post
office.
for
one
reason
or
another,
he
didn't
keep
any
job
very
long.
his
post
office
job,
he
left
with
the
expedition
that
the
job
involved
driving
truck
as
indeed
as
a
substitute,
and
that
he
would
not
drive
a
truck
as
he
said
as
a
matter
of
conviction.
he
explained
his
views
about
military
service,
war
and
religion
at
some
length.
but
i
think
they
could
be
epitomized
and
fairly
epitomized
by
a
short
passage
in
a
letter
that
he
wrote
to
the
director
of
the
selective
service
system
when
he
asked
him
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
president
for
the
classification
of
the
appeal
board.
in
that
letter
he
explained
his
opposition
to
military
institutions,
saying
the
presence
of
other
living
beings
in
the
universe,
sounds
a
call,
presents
a
vision,
a
fact,
a
mysterious
reality
that
i
cannot
deny
and
to
which
i
feel
the
impulse
to
relate.
i
view
physical
violence
on
the
other
hand
as
a
denial
of
life,
and
i
really
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
that
is
the
essence
although
he
used
great
many
more
words
of
his
objection
to
military
service.
the
hearing
officer
and
the
department
of
justice
recommended
denial
of
the
claim
to
exemption,
the
appeal
board
by
a
vote
of
five
to
nothing
did
deny
it.
when
peter
was
called
for
induction,
he
refused
to
submit
and
this
prosecution
followed
into
the
courts.
now
district
court
entered
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirm
because
it
found
that
peter's
belief,
involved
no
sense
to
responsibility
to
an
authority
higher
and
beyond
at
a
worldly
one.
i
would
emphasize
that
under
the
settled
course
of
decision
here,
the
only
question
is
whether
the
local
selective
service
board
and
the
appeal
board,
had
any
basis
whatever
for
concluding
that
peter
is
not
conscientiously
opposed
to
war
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief.
and
that
belief,
as
i
said
in
the
previous
case,
must
involve
duties
associated
with
some
relation,
to
something
that
can
be
called
a
divine
being.
call
it
god,
a
person,
an
ideal,
an
abstraction,
that
involves
duty
superior
to
those
arising
from
the
human
relation.
to
prevail
in
other
words,
peter
must
show
that
the
record
is
devoid
of
anything,
that
which
support
for
conclusion
that
he
had
such
a
belief.
i
make
a
good
deal
of
this
point
because
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
essence
of
the
selective
service
system
is
that
this
question
perhaps
especially
this
question,
of
where
the
ones
entitled
to
deferment
is
a
conscientious
objector,
should
be
resolved
by
the
people
who
could
see
and
hear
the
registrant
--
the
registrant,
concise
him
up
and
do
the
community
what
sort
of
people
who
are
in
it
as
possible,
and
thus
form
a
judgment
but
which
necessarily
would
involve
some
application
of
the
term
to
the
individual.
the
elements
that
convince
me,
that
there
was
such
a
basis
in
this
record,
it
convince
me
that
peter's
objections
could
be
found
not
to
be
based
on
religious
training
and
belief,
are
a
little
different
from
those
emphasized
in
our
brief.
i
think
our
brief
treats
it
a
little
too
conceptually
and
abstractly
i
should
say
my
brief,
because
i'm
not
blaming
anyone
else,
i
wrote
it.
but
i
do
think
the
essential
elements
can
be
stated
rather
frequent.
first,
peter
did
not
come
for
the
religious
background
and
had
no
religious
training.
second,
his
original
claim
to
conscien
--
to
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector
whether
he
made
did
not
assert
that
his
objection
was
based
on
any
religious
training
or
belief.
third,
he
belong
to
no
religious
sect,
he
did
not
worship,
he
had
no
form
of
creed,
he
had
no
body
apparently
of
moral
or
ethical
principles,
no
thought
out
body,
i
don't
mean
anything
other
than
that.
all
of
his
life,
he'd
been
independent
to
the
fight
of
being
a
rebel.
and
i
don't
say
that
to
criticize
him
at
the
slightest.
i
say
it
simply
to
indicate
that
he
would
be
--
he
was
a
personality
who
would
be
capable
of
challenging
the
government's
drafting
in
but
without
the
sustenance
that
comes
from
religion.
and
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
significant
point
in
deciding
the
nature
of
his
objection.
but
most
important,
peter's
life
and
his
statements
of
his
belief
convey
no
sense
of
ethical
obligation,
no
moral
code
except
concern
for
life,
no
belief
in
duty
or
belief
in
a
sense
of
obligation.
in
this
respect,
it
seems
to
me
that
peter's
case
compares
rather
unfavorably
with
seeger's
because
seeger
did
if
you
will
recall
speak
quite
movingly
of
the
moral
responsibility
to
make
one's
life
worthwhile
and
of
his
admiration
for
what
he
described
as
the
pagan
stoics.
but
there
seem
here
perhaps
i
don't
understand
peter,
but
i
do
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
basis
in
the
record,
from
which
the
draft
board
could
fairly
draw
the
conclusion,
that
peter
had
no
sense
of
religious
obligation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
must
have
a
--
page
20
of
the
peter
record?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
this
is
an
answer
to
a
question
of
what
he
means
by
religion.
alright,
in
answer
to
a
question
whether
he
acknowledges
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
of
whether
by
statement
that
his
declarations
of
the
whole
or
his
life
and
the
whole
do
not
show
that
he
had
this
kind
of
conviction
himself.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
sure,
let
me
say
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
have
no
doubt
that
peter
had
--
in
a
sense
poetic,
a
deep,
a
mystical
feeling,
a
belief
in
life,
its
existence
that
he
had
a
feeling
that
was
stirred
by
living
things,
by
the
processes
of
creation.
he
apparently
had
a
mystical
sense
of
oneness
with
those
things.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
again,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
essential
difference
between
what
it
seems
to
be
suggestive
by
your
question,
and
this
is
that
you
take
some
one
thing
that
enters
into
religion,
and
what
it
makes
that
religion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
no.
no,
but
i
really
don't
think
that
--
excuse
me.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
in
terms
of
having
a
body
of
ethical
or
moral
beliefs,
a
sense
of
obligation
that
peter
compared
unfavorably
to
see.
there
is
not
that
slight
question
i
have
fully
agreed
with,
that
to
the
extent
that
religion
involves
mystical
quality
and
i
think
that
it
is
in
its
purest
form
that
clearly
does,
that
peter
had
a
strong
mystical
quality.
i
would
emphasize
that.
i
think
with
peter's
case
reading
it
most
favorably
to
the
--
it
should
be
read
it
other
way.
but
reading
in
most
favorably
to
the
draft
board,
i
think
peter's
case
comes
down
to
this,
his
claim
to
religion.
that
he
believes
in
life
as
i
say
believes
in
existence,
that
he
feels
a
mystical
sense
of
oneness
with
living
things.
that
he
says
that
war
is
death
and
destruction,
and
therefore
he
will
not
participate.
it's
fair
to
add
that
for
the
same
reason
he
wouldn't
drive
a
truck.
he
does
have
a
very
genuine,
i'm
not
trying
--
i'm
trying
to
describe
it
not
to
make
fun
at
it.
he
does
have
a
genuine
feeling
for
life.
and
what
our
case
really
comes
down
to,
this
case
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
deism,
or
what
you
mean
by
god.
our
case
is
simple,
that
a
deeply
mystical
sense
of
the
importance
of
life
and
the
feeling
of
oneness
in
the
world
with
the
processes
of
creation.
but
devoid
of
all
other
aspects
of
religion
does
not,
we
submit,
meet
the
definition
of
religion
in
section
6
(f).
it
seems
to
me
that
--
there
are
many
illustrations
one
can
think
of
it
that
kind
of
feeling
about
life.
if
i
put
it
in
personal
terms,
it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
bring
myself
to
slaughter
a
chicken.
i've
never
understood
how
a
man
could
drown
kittens.
i
went
hunting
--
went
along
with
a
man
once
hunting,
and
while
climbing
on
the
mountain,
you
have
to
feel
a
good
beauty,
joy,
excitement,
once
he
shot
and
got
the
elk,
everything
was
death
and
ashes,
i
wouldn't
go
hunting
again.
but
i
don't
think
that
kind
of
feeling
standing
alone
meets
the
kind
of
definition
of
religion,in
terms
of
involving
higher
duties
in
those
among
men.
and
i
really
think
that's
what
our
case
comes
down
to
so
far
as
peter
is
concerned.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
there
are
these
things
i
did
learn.
i
slaughtered
chickens
quite
frequently.
i've
learn
to
do
it.
but
i
--
there
is
--
maybe
these
were
happy
illustrations
that
--
you
almost
have
to
put
these
things
in
personal
terms.
there
is
something
different
between
a
feeling
for
life,
however
poetic
or
mystical,
and
religion.
that's
really
where
my
case
stands
on,
and
so
far
as
peter
does.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
except
for
the
quotation
here,
i
don't
really
know
about
that
bratt
and
gilbert.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
again
perhaps
i
don't
understand
you.
again
of
course,
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
mysticisms
in
religions.
but
i
don't
think
that
makes
mysticism
religious.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
would
say
that
that
standing
alone
was
not
enough
to
compel
the
draft
board,
to
find
that
peter's
belief
met
this
kind
of
definition
and
religion
which
we
think
is
constitutional.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
in
his
letter
to
the
selective
service
system
which
i
think
you
will
find
begins
at
page
81
in
the
record,
mr.
justice,
81.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
third
case
is
the
jakobson
case.
let
me
say
at
the
outset,
that
jakobson
seems
to
us
to
have
a
very
serious
and
substantial
claim,
that
his
opposition
to
war
does
rest
on
religious
training
and
belief
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
indeed
for
me,
the
very
contrast
between
jakobson's
background
life
and
thought
than
peter's
is
the
most
persuasive
evidence
that
peter's
opposition
to
war
is
not
ground
for
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
the
two
are
quite
distinct.
jakobson
first
registered
with
his
local
board
on
september
2nd,
1953.
at
that
time,
he
made
no
claim
to
be
classified
as
a
conscientious
objector,
but
forwarded
a
doctor's
certificate
indicating
that
he
had
a
disabled
back
ailment,
but
he
was
classified
1-a.
he
sought
that
was
given
a
student
deferment
but
nothing
was
said
about
conscientious
objection.
in
january
'56,
where
he
took
a
leave
of
absence
from
college,
he
then
was
reclassified
1-a.
he
again
submitted
his
doctor's
certificate
pertaining
to
his
back,
and
seeking
deferment
on
grounds
of
health.
when
he
was
accepted
for
the
army
physically,
then
for
the
first
time,
he
claimed
in
a
letter
to
his
draft
board,
that
he
ought
to
be
classified
as
a
conscientious
objector.
then
he
asked
at
that
time
to
be
classified
at
section
1
(a)
(o),
which
would
require
it
to
enter
the
armed
forces,
but
would
exempt
him
from
combatant
training
and
belief,
that
he
was
granted
that
exemption.
now
sooner
when
he
got
that
exemption
then
he
wrote
and
he
said
he
decided
that
--
that
wasn't
was
what
he
was
entitled
to
by
reason
of
his
beliefs.
and
he
asked
for
exemption
classification
as
1-o,
which
would
excuse
him
from
taking
or
getting
a
part
in
the
military
service
at
all.
that
was
denied
by
the
local
draft
board.
he
then
appealed
to
the
appeal
board.
the
appeal
board
treating
the
case
de
novo
as
it
is
obliged
to
do,
classified
him
1-a.
the
appeal
board
or
rather
the
hearing
officer
of
the
appeal
board,
based
his
recommendation
that
submit
jakobson
be
classified
1-a
upon
two
grounds.
first
he
said
that
jakobson's
claim
was
based
on
a
personal
moral
code
and
that
he
was
not
sincere
in
his
belief,
that
the
second
was
lack
of
sincerity
and
first
the
moral
code.
the
appeal
board
simply
voted
four
to
nothing,
to
deny
the
exemption.
jakobson
also
refused
to
submit
to
induction.
the
district
court
entered
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
jakobson's
appealed.
the
second
circuit,
we
think
correctly,
said
that
it
couldn't
tell
of
which
theory
the
appeal
board's
determination
went.
that
therefore
either
was
inadequate,
the
conviction
must
be
reversed
with
the
selective
service
system
free
to
take
whatever
further
action
it
deemed
appropriately.
the
second
circuit
then
inquired
whether
into
jakobson's
view
assuming
their
sincerity,
amounted
to
religious
training
and
belief.
and
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
to
whom
obligations
superior
to
those
above
men
existed
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
in
an
opinion
by
judge
friendly
that
the
court
concluded
that
jakobson
did
have
such
beliefs.
again,
i
emphasize
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
record
permits
the
draft
board
to
come
to
a
contrary
conclusion.
we
do
not
quarrel
in
any
material
respect
with
judge
friendly's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i'm
also
not
inclined
that
to
stress
any
difference
really,
as
to
whether
jakobson's
presentation
of
his
views
about
the
nature
of
god,
fails
to
come
within
the
statute.
they
are
remarkably
similar
to
those
of
that
professor
tillich,
dr.
robinson.
it
does
seem
to
us,
however,
that
the
record
supports
the
conclusion
that
his
views
about
war,
what
everybody
think
about
the
existence
or
nature
of
what
he
call
goodness
or
another
occasions
as
supreme
reality,
had
very
little
--
that
they
had
very
little
to
do
with
each
other.
that
his
argumentation
about
war
was
essentially
of
political,
humanitarian,
political
philosophy
what
you
put
in
that
sense,
humanitarian
or
a
personal
moral
code.
he
stated
his
objections
at
two
places
that
appear
in
the
record,
one
is
r-46
to
48,
the
other
is
r-114,
150.
and
they
come
to
an
end
of
this.
his
first
objection
was
that
war
is
violently
destructive,
killing
thousands
of
innocent
person,
destroying
cities.
he
says
all
the
creative
effort,
all
the
time
and
money,
all
that
could
and
should
go
into
the
effort
to
relieve
poverty
and
combat
disease,
is
channeled
into
destruction.
this
i
submit
is
a
judgment
that
the
community
is
called
upon
to
make
of
course.
the
second
reason
is
that,
the
soldiers
on
the
other
side
are
often
as
innocent
as
the
soldiers
on
our
side.
third,
he
says
that
war
springs
from
and
generates
a
moral
intellectual
and
emotional
atmosphere
that
breeds
further
violence
and
more
wars.
the
ends
we
all
desire
do
not
justify
the
methods
of
war,
he
said.
but
i
also
believe
that
the
methods
of
war
are
not
a
practical
means
to
the
end.
but
again
i
think
that
he
argued
it
in
terms
of
that
policy
or
politics.
and
then
he
says
finally,
the
better
way
to
bring
about
a
peaceful
world
is
for
individual
whose
experience
is
directing
is
for
individuals,
whose
conscience
is
directed
to
do
so,
to
stand
against
the
core
of
the
problem
by
refusing
to
adopt
the
techniques
of
war.
that
again
is
in
terms
of
how
to
bring
about
the
democratic
political,
social,
humanitarian
ideals
that
the
community
holds
and
that
the
community
is
charged
in
determining
how
to
promote.
it
does
not
lift
the
argument
as
i
see
it
to
the
different
or
higher
realm
in
the
sense
of
transcendent,
that
the
statute
refers
to
when
it
speaks
about
obligation
beyond
those
arising
among
men.
