mr.
elwood
hutcheson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
we
believe
that
the
petitioner's
position
here
is
entirely
unsound
both
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
law.
first,
let
me
briefly
clarify
several
important
undisputed
factual
matters
that
have
immaterial
bearing
on
both
of
those
issues.
under
the
expressed
language
of
these
contracts,
the
mid-annual
minimum
warranty
of
the
$500
per
machine
plus
the
4%
sales
tax
was
payable
irrespective
entirely
of
the
standard
use
of
the
machines
during
any
year
and
irrespective
of
whether
the
machines
were
used
at
all.
in
other
words,
it
was
about
the
--
for
--
particularly
of
our
concern
whether
the
machines
were
used
or
the
extent
they
were
used
the
minimum
royalties
were
payable
in
any
event.
and
the
judgment
center
appealed
from
here
for
the
--
insofar
as
they
were
entered,
they
cover
a
number
of
years.
but
the
judgments
that
were
entered
for
the
years
1957
and
subsequent
years
of
--
were
only
for
the
minimum
royalty
not
for
anything
in
addition
to
the
minimum
royalty.
it
is
undisputed
that
these
two
petitioners
had
hired
the
use
of
the
competitive
larger
and
newer
stationary
machine
that
were
owned
by
their
neighbors
or
their
relatives
and
paid
for
that
use.
the
--
here,
there
is
no
monopoly
in
hop-picking
machines.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
stationery
machines
have
come
into
such
favor
although
much
more
expensive
that
since
1947,
there
has
been
a
manufacture
or
sale
of
not
a
single
new
portable
picking
machine.
on
the
other
hand,
the
suggestion
in
the
reply
brief
here
that
these
portable
machines
had
become
obsolete
is
utterly
absurd
and
completely
contrary
to
the
record.
fees
has
not
interfered
or
attempted
to
interfere
in
any
measure
with
the
use
of
any
of
these
machines
or
any
of
these
patented
inventions
subsequent
to
expiration
of
any
of
the
patents.
we've
not
brought
any
injunction
suit
or
anything
of
that
kind,
either
as
to
the
general
public
or
as
to
the
petitioners.
admittedly
as
to
--
this
is
an
over
simplification,
but
as
to
a
particular
single
patent,
permit
expires
admittedly
the
invention
becomes
in
the
public
domain
and
the
public
has
a
right
to
use
it
and
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
petitioner's
principle
contentions
here.
that
in
some
way
we're
interfering
with
that
but
we
have
not
interfered
with
that
as
to
the
general
public.
we
have
not
interfered
with
that
as
to
the
petitioners
except
merely
that
we're
asking
for
the
payment
of
certain
money
by
the
petitioners,
based
upon
the
contracts
that
they
entered
into.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
well,
the
--
there
were
several
important
patents
that
expired
at
the
end
of
the
1957
season.
in
other
words,
they
were
granted
in
1940
i
believe
or
41
and
expired
at
the
end
of
the
1957
season.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
that
is
correct,
yes.
no
payments
made
by
either
petitioner
after
52.
of
course,
there
were
by
other
purchasers
but
not
by
the
two
petitioners
here.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
well,
it
varied
with
different
contracts
--
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes.
and
as
to
brulotte,
it
expired
at
the
end
of
the
1958
season
and
as
to
charvet,
it
expired
at
the
end
of
the
1960
season.
in
other
words,
it
extended
only
a
relatively
short
time
after
the
expiration
of
these
basic
patents
at
the
end
of
the
1957
season.
here,
there
were
12
original
patents
which
were
listed
by
number,
and
title,
and
by
date
of
issue
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
those
12
being
all
that
had
been
issued
up
to
that
time.
the
contracts
also
said,
other
patents
pending
in
addition
to
the
12,
there
are
--
or
first,
one
of
the
twelve,
the
last
of
the
twelve
did
not
expire
until
after
the
expiration
of
these
royalty
contracts.
i'll
refer
to
that
again
in
the
moment.
there
were
three
additional
patents,
in
addition
to
the
twelve,
as
to
which
applications
were
pending
when
these
contracts
were
entered
into
upon
which
patent
were
later
issued
and
there
were
four
additional
ones
that
were
applied
for
later
by
fees,
and
upon
which
patents
were
later
issued.
and
thys'
testimony
is
undisputed
that
these
inventions
covered
by
these
various
patents
which
expired
later
could
have
been
incorporated
and
were
suitable,
and
available
and
beneficial
for
incorporation
in
the
machines
as
improvements
and
additions
thereto.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
very
definitely.
they
could've
utilized
several
of
them
if
--
thus
entirely
optional
with
that,
but
yes,
they
were
suitable
and
beneficial
for
use.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
well
--
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
the
manufacturer
was
willing
to
help.
in
other
words,
they
could
have
--
these
additional
devices,
for
example,
a
new
device
for
thinning
crops,
more
thinner,
eliminating
the
leaves
and
stems.
these
were
available.
they
--
it
wasn't
surely
a
theoretical
academic
matter.
they
were
available
and
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
or
others
actually
purchase
and
used
them
was
entirely
optional
with
that.
but
these
were
not
dead-letter
patents
any
of
them,
they
were
actually
used
by
large
numbers
of
people.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
were
these
patents
on
the
--
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes.
that
is
--
the
contracts
were
all
of
the
same
general
type.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
that
is
exactly
right,
yes.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
it
is
my
position
--
yes,
your
honor.
the
quid
pro
quo
referred
to
by
the
petitioner
actually
was
--
the
contract
is
elementary,
it
should
be
given
a
--
for
reason
--
reasonably
possible
in
lawful
interpretation,
just
as
a
statute
should
be
as
reasonably
possible
construed
to
be
constitution
--
in
such
a
matter
is
to
be
constitutional.
and
as
i
see
it,
the
benefits
that
were
received
by
the
petitioners,
another
similarly
situated,
was
the
right
which
the
general
public
did
not
have
without
being
subject
to
infringement
suit,
the
right
to
use
any
or
all
of
the
existing
or
future
of
these
patents.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
it
would
not
have
been
practicable
where
we
are
concern
with
a
single
machine
and
additions
and
accessories
to
a
single
machine.
it
would
have
been
very
impracticable
to
have
--
had
a
reduction
of
the
royalty
as
time
went
off.
in
other
words,
that
if
there
were
a
large
number
of
items
used
separately
and
independently,
that
might
have
been
practicable,
but
it
was
not
practicable
to
this
kind
of
a
situation
where
we
were
concern
with
a
single
machine
and
additions
on
accessories
too.and
i
submit
that
legally
it
was
not
necessary
to
do
so.
in
other
words
here,
before
the
expiration
of
any
of
these
patents,
these
parties
voluntarily
entered
into
this
contract.
if
the
farmers
had
had
the
cash
to
make
a
full
payment
not
only
of
lindleman's
charge
for
manufacturing
the
machines
but
also
the
thys'
patent
royalties
at
the
time
of
original
purchase
of
the
machine,
well
good.
but
this
patent
financing
arrangements
was
necessary
from
a
practical
standpoint.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
well,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
i
would
say
no.
in
other
words,
i
was
going
to
mention
that.
but
here,
it
is
undisputed
that
neither
these
petitioners
nor
anyone
else
ever
requested
a
license
limited
to
certain
specific
patents
or
payable
in
any
different
manner,
in
other
words,
payable
in
larger
amount
for
shorter
periods.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
no,
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
--
i'm
arguing
of
both
--
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
it
is
my
belief
that
under
the
actual
fact
as
they
exist
here,
undisputed
on
this
record,
that
the
court
should
not
even
reach
this
legal
question
as
they
are
presented
here.
in
other
words,
that
is
my
first
contention
which
is
a
factual
matter
based
on
the
record
of
the
evidence
here.
secondly,
it
is
my
--
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
if
your
honors
please,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
not
a
single
decision
of
this
court
cited
by
petitioners
is
a
patent
royalty
case.
they
are
patent
infringement,
injunction
suits
or
antitrust
suits
or
something
of
that
kind
and
the
only
one
or
two
decisions
of
lower
courts
that
they
have
cited
are
royalty
cases.
i'd
like
now
to
refer
to
the
hazeltine
decision
of
this
court
because
i
submit
that
it
is
conclusive.
it
was
a
royalty
contract
case
which
provided
for
a
royalty
based
on
a
percentage
of
the
total
gross
sales
of
the
licensee
including
both
patented
articles
and
unpatented
articles,
plus
secondly,
a
--
an
annual
minimum
royalty
not
of
a
measly
$500
as
in
this
case,
but
$10,000
per
year
annual
minimum
royalty.
and
that
this
court
affirmed
a
summary
judgment
granted
by
the
court
below
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
upheld
the
legality
of
the
contract
and
the
royalty
arrangements
in
both
respects.
the
same
defenses
were
made,
misuse
of
patents,
violation
of
antitrust
law
and
so
forth.
to
be
sure
if
one
of
them
--
and
i
say
if
the
court
had
discussed
at
greater
length
the
specific
question.
but
the
record
in
that
--
the
question
necessarily
was
decided
even
though
not
fully
discussed,
i
submit,
the
record
in
the
hazeltine
case
shows
that
a
large
number
of
patents,
i
believe
about
half
of
them
had
expired
and
others
had
been
invalidated.
the
court
there
emphasized,
which
is
true
factually
in
this
case
that
there
was
never
any
request
of
a
licensee
for
a
different
kind
of
royalty
arrangement
and/or
refusal
to
give
a
different
kind
of
royalty
arrangement
which
is
absolutely
the
fact
here
that
that's
undisputed.
either
the
petitioners
or
anyone
else
ever
requested
anything
different.
and
to
suggest,
as
petitioners
do,
that
if
i
may
say
so,
this
court
did
not
know
what
was
doing
or
that
there
was
an
oversight
in
making
a
decision,
i
submit
is
utterly
absurd
because
the
issues
were
directly
raised
in
each
of
the
three
courts,
including
this
court,
and
especially,
in
view
of
the
dissenting
opinion
which
expressly
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
case
involved,
expired
patents,
and
invalidated
patents
and
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
connection
citing
the
scott
case
which
is
--
which
petitioners
principally
relied
--
rely
on
and
had
been
decided
only
five
years
previously.
so,
i
submit
that
the
hazeltine
case
does
decide
these
matters
and
is
conclusive
and
controlling
and
has
been
generally
followed
in
many
royalty
contracts
since
that
time.
and
as
i
read
the
case,
the
court
considers
in
the
same
category
unpatented
articles
and
articles
as
to
which
the
patents
had
expired.
both
of
which
would
be
in
the
public
domain
and
which
is
in
line
with
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
the
recent
sears,
roebuck,
the
stiffel
case.
so,
i
submit
that
that
--
the
case
is
conclusive.
the
court
there
also
distinguished
and
held
inapplicable
the
line
of
cases
strongly
relied
upon
by
petitioners
here,
the
tie-in
cases.
well,
the
hazeltine
held
are
that
those
are
not
applicable
at
all
to
this
kind
of
a
situation
and
certainly
they
are
not
applicable
here
because
these
never
insisted
or
required
that
unpatented
articles
or
materials
they
used
in
connection
with
these
machines.
and
that
is
the
essence
of
the
tie-in
cases
so
that
they
are
not
applicable
here
at
all.
i
submit
that
in
final
essence,
this
is
closely
analogous,
if
i
may
say
so,
to
a
situation
of
judges
or
teachers
or
policeman's
retirement
pensions.
they
are
deferred
of
partial
compensation
for
benefits
previously
received
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
situation
here
and
certainly
there
is
nothing
immoral
or
against
public
policy
about
them.
on
these
matters
of
public
policy,
the
petitioners
rely
upon
the
scott
case
--
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
--
i'm
contending
that
were
right
on
the
facts
but
i'm
meeting
them
head-on
on
their
legal
contention,
if
i
make
myself
clear.
and
what
i'm
arguing
now,
i'm
assuming
arguendo
as
the
state's
supreme
court
did
that
their
factual
contention
is
correct.
the
--
what
the
scott
case
hold
is
that
--
and
all
that
it
holds,
that
was
not
a
royalty
but
a
patent
infringement
suit
and
it
held
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
enjoin
the
use
of
an
invention
covered
by
a
previous
expired
patent.
there,
it
had
been
assigned
by
the
defendant
to
the
plaintiff
and
they
held
the
defendant
was
not
estopped
to
raise
the
defense
of
invalidity
because
it
was
covered
by
an
expired
patent.
well,
here
as
i
mentioned
before,
we
have
not
and
are
not
withholding
from
the
public
the
use
of
anything.
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
dollars
and
not
of
use,
not
of
extension
of
the
monopoly
or
anything
of
that
kind.
i
submit
that
there's
nothing
against
public
policy
at
all
in
an
extension
of
voluntary,
neutrally
convenient
financing
arrangement
of
this
kind.
on
the
contrary,
it
seems
to
me
that
for
at
least
two
reasons
public
policy
requires
affirmance
of
these
judgments.
first,
it
is
well
settled
by
decisions
of
this
court
that
in
the
absence
of
serious
public
injury
or
possibly
fraud
in
the
state
or
something
of
that
kind,
that
public
is
a
paramount
--
public
policy
requires
freedom
of
contract.
while
here,
i
submit
there
is
no
serious
public
injury
at
all
in
permitting
recovery
on
contracts
of
this
nature.
secondly,
the
validity
and
enforceability
of
arrangements
of
this
nature,
i
submit
is
necessary
for
or
certainly
desirable
from
the
standpoint
of
agricultural
financing.
farmers
like
industry
have
to
mechanize.
many
of
them
are
small,
undercapitalized.
if
your
honors
strike
down
a
convenient
financing
arrangement
of
this
kind,
it
seems
to
me
the
effect
would
be
frankly
disastrous
for
undercapitalized
smaller
farmers
or
industries.
so
i
submit
that
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
public
policy
and
should
be
permitted.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
well,
that
is
what
the
contract
said.
the
judgments
were
not
entered
on
that
basis
but
its
true,
that's
what
the
contract
says.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
well,
they
must
pay
an
unpaid
balance
of
deferred
compensation
for
the
use
and
the
benefits
that
they
have
received
previously
under
the
contract.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
i
would
put
it
this
way
your
honor.
i
contend
that
the
--
that
that
is
lawful
and
valid
to
do
that
under
these
circumstances
where
it
is
voluntarily
entered
into
long
before
the
patents
expired.
secondly,
in
answer
to
the
question,
i
would
say
that
in
any
event
we
would
be
entitled
to
the
minimum
royalties
which
is
all
that
we
recovered
in
this
case
so
that
your
honors
take
that
view,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
in
any
event.
the
--
here,
i
submit
there's
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
there's
no
illegal
price-fixing
arrangement
or
anything
of
that
kind.
there
is
no
monopoly
because
there
is
a
very
intense
competition
of
stationary
picking
machines
and
there
is
no
unreasonable
restraint
of
a
trade
or
interstate
commerce.
we
don't
restrain
anybody.
we
don't
try
too.
we're
merely
act
--
asking
that
they
pay
the
balance
of
the
agreed
compensation
or
royalties
which
they
voluntarily
agreed
to
pay.
the
great
weight
of
authority
and
the
better
reasoning,
i
submit,
sustains
our
position
and
your
honors,
i
submit,
should
adhere
to
the
hazeltine
case.
the
tax
writers,
walker
and
ellis
and
corpus
juris
secundum
and
so
forth,
all
definitely
state
the
law
in
accordance
with
our
position.
the
lower
federal
courts
are
practically
unanimous
to
the
decisions
of
the
third
circuit
which
i
believe
are
distinguishable
which
i
won't
go
into
now
but
that
is
referred
to
into
the
briefs.
every
state
court
which
has
considered
the
matter
has
held
in
accordance
with
this
rule
mainly.
that
--
if
a
contract
is
silent
on
the
subject,
it
is
automatically
presumed
that
the
royalty
obligation
terminates
at
the
expiration
of
the
patent.
but
if
the
contract
expressly
provides
to
the
contrary,
that
is
a
valid
and
lawful
provision.
and
that
has
been
generally
understood
as
the
law
for
many
years
and
certainly
is
not
changed
by
the
scott
case
which
did
not
even
involved
royalties
at
all.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes.
that
is
one
of
my
contentions,
yes.
i
contend
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
that
would
be
true
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
elwood
hutcheson
yes,
sir,
yes.
i
urge
the
--
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
submit,
do
not
present
that
clear
cut
legal
question
as
petitioners
contend.
so,
i
am
making
both
contentions.
in
other
words,
the
matter
of
reduction
of
royalty
was
referred
to
here
and
it
is
undisputed
that
originally
these
contracts
worth
for
$5
per
bale,
a
few
years
later
and
before
these
contracts
with
petitioners
were
entered
into
which
involved
the
resale
of
these
machines,
thys
voluntarily
reduced
it
from
$5
to
$3.33
per
bale,
200-pound
bales,
$3
they
paid
by
october
15th.
the
$500
minimum
royalty
remained
in
the
same
and
thys
testified
and
it's
undisputed
that
at
time,
he
had
two
alternatives.
he
could
have
reduced
the
royalty
period
and
if
he
had,
he
might
have
avoided
this
question
but
it
was
considered
for
the
best
interest
of
the
farmers
instead
of
reducing
the
royalty
period,
to
reduce
the
royalty
rate
and
let
it
continue
for
the
same
period
as
before.
not
extending
the
period
but
remained
--
the
period
remained
in
the
same
by
reducing
the
royalty
rate.
the
advantage
to
the
farmer
has
been
that
out
of
the
economies
of
the
machine
picking
operation
they
could
pay
the
royalties
and
that
it
was
to
their
advantage
to
have
longer
time
to
do
so.no
interest
being
charged.
and
thereby
the
amount
that
they
would
pay
each
year
would
be
less
which
was
certainly
for
their
benefit
and
it
is
undisputed
that
that
perhaps
it
did
actually
occur
here.
so,
here
there
was
no
agreement
that
anyone
was
not
to
use
an
expired
patent
operation
either
the
petitioners
or
anyone
else.
we
have
merely
an
agreement
to
pay
money
in
a
manner
and
on
a
basis
that
was
not
an
excessive
financial
burden
on
the
hop
farmers.
and
these
contracts
were
voluntarily
entered
into
long
before
any
of
these
patents
expired
and
i
submit
that
they
are
not
against
public
policy.
they
are
lawful
and
valid
and
the
judgments
appealed
promptly
should
be
affirmed.
