mr.
edward
s.
irons
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
for
an
accounting
for
royalties
due
under
a
patent
license
agreement.
the
license
agreement
was
not
for
a
single
patent
but
rather
for
a
package
or
group
of
patents
many
of
which
expired
during
the
license
term.
the
action
was
brought
to
collect
the
royalties
for
the
continuing
right
to
use
machines
covered
by
the
expired
patents,
none
of
the
other
patents
in
the
package
being
incorporated
into
the
machines.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
parties
might
contract
to
pay
post-expiration
royalties
and
that
there
was
no
legal
or
equitable
reason
why
they
should
not
do
so.
the
issue
basically
for
consideration
therefore
is
whether
that
holding
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
was
correct.
the
position
of
the
petitioners
is
that
it
is
incorrect
for
two
basic
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
the
primary
premise
upon
which
the
patents
laws
are
based
is
the
constitutional
one
that
the
patent
shall
be
for
a
limited
term.
underlying
this
concept
is
the
further
consideration
that
the
patent
is
granted
on
condition
that
when
it
expires
the
invention
shall
be
available
to
the
free
use
of
the
public
and
that
the
patentee
is
foreclosed
from
compromising
in
any
way
the
dedication
which
was
the
condition
on
which
he
got
the
grant
in
the
first
place.
it
therefore
follows
that
any
attempt
to
compromise
that
dedication
by
the
collection
of
royalties
by
private
contract
after
expiration
is
of
course
contrary
and
in
violation
of
the
primary
bargain
with
the
people
which
the
patents
represents.
and
it
is
that
primary
bargain
with
the
people
requiring
the
dedication
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle
which
must
control
over
any
private
contract
which
seeks
a
different
result.
the
second
and
i
believe
equally
important
reason
why
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
was
wrong
is
because
as
has
been
repeatedly
recognized,
the
subject
matter,
the
invention
of
a
patent
which
has
expired
is
indeed
dedicated,
it
is
unpatented.
and
so
therefore,
a
private
contract
which
extends
the
right
to
collect
royalties
to
that
unpatented
subject
matter
is
on
its
face
an
extension
of
the
monopoly
to
unpatented
materials
and
derogation
not
only
of
the
principles
of
the
patent
laws
but
of
the
principles
in
antitrust
laws
as
they
had
been
applied
in
analogous
situations.
now,
these
concepts
actually
it
seems
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
the
facts
your
honor
is
this,
as
i
said
these
licenses
are
for
package
of
patents.
on
the
face
of
the
license,
your
honor,
there
are
12
patents.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
other
patents
pending,
that's
right.
now
the
court
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
it
isn't
used
in
the
machine.
it
never
was
used
in
the
machine
and
all
the
patents
that
are
used
in
the
machine
have
expired.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
none
of
them
are
used.
they
have
ever
been
used
in
the
machines.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
subject
to
correction
your
honor,
i
think
three
or
four.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
the
record
doesn't
support
seven.
that's
why
i
said
three
or
four.
i
don't
mean
to
battle
with
the
respondent
on
the
fact
point.
i
can
see
three
or
four
unexpired
pending
patents
there
within.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
actually,
there
were
only
seven
actually
used.
they
have
all
expired.
they
expired
long
before
the
end
of
the
contract
term.
that
is
why
the
court
below
found
that
the
real
consideration
for
the
continued
payment
of
the
royalties
had
to
be
for
the
expired
patents.
the
unexpired
ones
were
never
used.
i
--
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
point
in
just
a
little
bit
more
detailed
because
it
is
a
rather
important
one
and
i
think
perhaps
we
might
as
well
meet
it
right
now.
this
situation
your
honor
is
characteristic
of
so-called
package
or
fee
licensing
which
is
widespread
in
the
industry.
this
is
not
a
--
an
isolated
for
a
unique
situation.
it
is
conventional
in
the
industry
for
an
owner
--
of
the
owner
of
a
basic
patent
which
will
expire
in
a
stated
time,
to
license
it
in
a
package
with
either
unexpired
patents
or
with
the
trademark
or
with
know-how
or
with
some
form
of
right
which
exist
in
perpetuity.
now,
the
appeal
of
the
original
package
normally
is
the
basic
patent
or
patents.
the
ex
--
the
royalties
continue
however
undiminished
throughout
the
term
of
these
agreements
and
long
after
the
basic
patents
expire.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
would
say
normally
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
it's
usually
based
on
the
gross
business
to
the
licensee
whether
or
not
there
is
a
use.
although
in
some
cases,
it
is
based
on
use.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
in
this
case,
it
was
based
on
use.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
certainly
do
that.
i
want
to
finish
my
comments
that
i
was
making
on
these
package
licenses
and
essentially
it
is
this.
a
patent
owner
has
a
basic
patent
or
patents
which
are
needed.
these
are
the
appeal
to
sell
the
license.
he
does
not
license
them
alone.
he
licensed
them
--
licenses
them
in
a
package
with
other
patents
pending
with
know-how
with
trademarks
which
may
exist
in
perpetuity.
now,
it
is
self-evident
that
the
appeal,
the
reason
for
the
agreement
to
pay
the
royalty
in
the
first
place
was
the
need
for
the
basic
patents.
but
the
terms
of
these
agreements
extend
long
after
the
basic
patents
expired.
and
the
royalties
continue
undiminished
on
the
pretext
that
there
are
still
some
considerations
in
the
form
of
some
patent
maybe
not
even
thought
off
when
the
agreement
was
signed
but
it
went
to
patents
which
might
be
pending
or
trademarks
or
know-how
or
some
other
form
of
right
which
may
exist
in
perpetuity.
i
think
it
is
a
simple
matter
of
logic
that
however
much
of
that
consideration
was
allocable
to
the
basic
patents
at
the
beginning,
continuous
to
be
paid,
there's
no
provision
in
these
agreements
for
a
reallocation.
and
certainly,
any
such
arrangement
necessarily
results
in
a
perpetuation
of
the
tribute
paid
for
the
right
to
use
the
expired
inventions.
these
are
contractual
arrangements
by
which
the
consequences
of
the
dedication
which
is
the
condition
on
which
the
patent
is
granted
in
the
first
place
are
obviated
and
avoided.
these
are
standard
business
practices
in
the
sense
that
there
are
great
many
licenses
of
this
type.
my
position
is
that
--
as
this
court
has
emphasized
in
a
somewhat
different
context,
each
patent
must
stand
on
its
own
feet.
the
person
who
wishes
to
acquire
a
license
under
the
patent
must
be
free
to
deal
with
it
on
its
own
merit.
it
must
not
borrow
quality
from
some
other
patent
by
any
means,
because
if
it
does,
this
enlarges
the
monopoly
of
the
patent
from
which
it
borrows
quality.
manifestly,
that's
what
happened
in
our
case
at
the
bar.
there
were
presumably
seven
patents
that
were
needed
and
that's
why,
the
licenses
were
taken
in
the
first
place.
the
licenses
however
extended
for
years
after
those
expired.
the
court
below
found
that
the
others
were
mere
surplus
and
the
parties
gave
no
consideration
to
those
as
a
part
of
the
package
and
insofar
as
the
basis
for
consideration
was
concerned.and
so
it
recognized
that
the
license
did
require
post-expiration
royalties.
it
expressly
held
that
it
did
and
the
obligation
to
pay
them
was
enforced.
now
to
specifically
answer
your
question,
there
was
a
provision
in
these
agreements
in
paragraph
7
which
the
licensor
put
in
there
in
anticipation
of
this
very
circumstance
and
it
said
that
the
royalty
shall
continue
with
an
undiminished
rate
throughout
the
term
regardless
of
the
expiration
of
any
patents.
on
these
particular
agreements
before
the
court,
it's
not
a
matter
of
argument.
it's
a
matter
of
the
actual
provisions
in
the
agreement
itself.
the
same
principles
apply
in
a
more
general
situation
in
which
i
have
addressed
myself.
i
want
--
now
to
comment
very
briefly
on
another
argument
which
the
respondent
has
made
and
i
think
the
brief
comment
is
all
that
would
be
necessary.
it
is
argued
by
the
respondent
that
this
maybe
that
they
are
post-expiration
royalties.
but
these
were
voluntarily
agreed
to
and
they
were
not
coerced
and
since
they
were
voluntary
agreed
to
it,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is
that
this
is
clearly
wrong.
the
constitution
in
these
patent
statutes
permit
patents
only
for
limited
terms.
this
court
repeatedly
has
held
that
when
the
patent
expires,
the
monopoly
seizes
to
exist.
that
no
part
of
it
can
be
recaptured
by
any
means
and
that
no
private
contract
can
extend
the
monopoly.
and
so
i
say,
it's
just
as
illegal
to
extend
that
monopoly
by
a
so-called
voluntary
private
agreement
as
it
is
by
any
other
kind.
and
it
is
therefore,
not
material
in
the
context
of
collecting
post-expiration
royalties.
the
--
whether
or
not
the
agreement
was
coerced
ab
initio.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant
as
your
honor
recognized.
it
is
not
a
case
and
let's
look
at
the
distinction
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
but
in
this
sense
your
honor,
the
payment
was
--
in
that
case,
with
the
right
to
use
the
machine
during
the
term
of
the
patent.
it
simply
was
the
payment
which
was
extended
and
as
a
matter
of
let's
say
economics,
there
was
no
payment
for
the
right
to
use
after
the
patent
expired.
in
these
cases,
package
license
agreements
are
obviously
his
and
that
i
say
is
the
difference.
i
say
you
cannot
charge
a
royalty
for
the
right
to
use
the
invention
of
an
expired
patent.
if
you
agree
in
advance
that
this
patent
was
going
to
expire
on
a
day
certain
and
i
want
to
use
it
until
it
does
and
i'll
pay
you
$10,000
but
i
want
to
--
financially
in
a
situation
where
i
want
to
spread
that
predetermined
payment
over
a
period
of
years,
i
say,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
but
i
say
again,
that
is
not
this
case.
now,
your
honor
asked
me
in
what
way
these
agreements
restricted
the
alienation
of
the
machines
i
believe.
these
agreements
which
are
before
the
court
have
an
expressed
provision
in
them
that
the
machines
which
were
involved
shall
not
be
encumbered
in
any
way
and
that
the
agreement
shall
not
be
assigned
or
transferred
in
any
way
by
the
licensees.
the
result
was
that
when
the
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes.
but
he
did
not
permit
the
transfer
unless
the
subsequent
purchaser
agreed
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions
including
the
post-expiration
royalty
payments
and
he
there
--
therefore
guaranteed
to
himself
the
post-expiration
royalty
payments.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
that's
right.
but
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
i
think
the
alienability
of
these
machines,
it
was
sharply
restricted
and
competition
in
them
was
restricted
because
it
was
necessary
for
anyone
who
wanted
to
sell
them
to
go
out
and
find
someone
else
who
would
accept
the
same
deal
and
this
is
unique.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
circumstances
where
in
--
an
item
of
tangible
property
has
been
sold
under
any
such
restraint.
you
see
your
honor
what
happened
is,
this
respondent
did
not
sell
the
total
machine.
he
sold
what
he
called
naked
title
to
it,
but
pointedly
quote,
“without
the
right
to
use”.
so
whoever
purchase
this
for
3000
odd
dollars
add
machine
he
couldn't
use.
and
to
use
it,
he
had
to
take
this
patent
license
including
the
post-expiration
royalty
provisions
of
it.
and
to
sell
it,
he
not
only
had
to
find
the
purchaser
but
he
--
they
had
to
find
a
purchaser
who
would
also
take
the
patent
license.
now,
it
is
unique.
this
is
an
effort
to
avoid
the
normal
consequence
of
the
sale
of
the
patented
device,
and
a
license
arises
as
a
matter
of
law
when
a
patented
device
is
sold
usually.
it
--
to
use
the
shorthand
expression,
extinguishes
the
monopoly
and
the
machine
is
free
of
the
patent
after
it
is
sold.
that
law
was
avoided
in
this
case
by
the
sale
of
the
title
only,
without
the
right
to
use
and
the
requirement
that
you
get
the
right
to
use,
you
must
take
this
license
which
extended
the
monopoly
of
the
patent.
i
have,
i
think
treated
the
basic
arguments
which
are
advanced
by
the
respondent,
namely
the
voluntary
matter
and
the
matter
of
the
royalties
being
justified
as
consideration
for
unexpired
patents.
i
want
to
conclude
by
pointing
out
that
this
court
in
every
context
in
which
it
has
appeared
has
recognized
that
the
dedication
of
a
patent
is
absolute
and
cannot
be
compromised.
it
happened
early
in
the
law
of
double
patenting
which
precludes
a
second
patent
for
the
same
invention
on
exactly
these
grounds
in
the
singer
and
kellogg
cases.
it
was
held
that
when
a
patent
expired,
the
public
right
to
use
the
invention
including
the
very
form
on
which
it
was
produced
under
the
patent
passed
to
the
public,
together
with
the
right
to
use
the
name.
singer
in
one
case,
(inaudible)
in
the
other
so
that
the
right
would
not
be
qualified.
in
scott
paper
company,
it
was
held
that
a
doctrine
of
estoppel
arising
under
common
law
contract
which
would
normally
have
prevented
the
assignor
from
challenging
the
validity
of
the
signed
patent
did
not
operate
because
if
it
were
permitted
to
operate,
the
primary
public
right
would
be
compromised,
and
of
course
the
later
cases
are
sears
and
comco
which
were
decided
in
february
of
this
year
i
believe,
once
they
held
that
a
state
could
not
grant
patents
of
its
own
or
otherwise
operating
in
such
a
way
to
compromise
the
paramount
public
right
in
the
subject
matter
of
a
patent
which
had
expired
or
in
that
case
had
been
invalidated.
also,
as
i
have
said
obviously
under
these
decisions
that
which
was
once
patented
but
it
is
no
more
is
unqualifiedly
in
the
public
domain,
a
contract
which
extends
the
monopoly
to
that
material
clashes
head
on
with
the
doctrine
that
the
antitrust
laws
forbid,
the
extension
of
the
patent
monopoly
by
contract
to
unpatented
materials.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
pointedly
your
honor,
the
contract
was
for
an
original
term
perhaps
significantly
for
17
years
which
is
the
same
term
as
the
patent
term.
well,
the
patents
were
no
issue
on
the
same
time
it
just
--
perhaps
is
coincidental.
the
first
agreements
were
entered
into
in
the
early
40's.
at
the
very
beginning,
all
of
those
agreements
extended
to
a
time
subsequent
to
the
expiration
of
any
patent
then
issued
and
certainly,
passed
the
expiration
of
any
patent
then
used
in
the
machines.
on
the
face
of
it,
because
of
paragraph
7
which
provides
that
the
royalty
shall
continue
undiminished
regardless
of
the
expiration
of
the
patents.
the
contracting
terms
required
payment
of
royalties
after
expiration
for
the
right
to
use
the
inventions
of
the
expired
patents,
the
expired
ones
being
the
only
ones
ever
used
in
the
machine.
when
it
--
after
they
expire,
this
obligation
as
private
contractual
obligation
to
pay
royalties
for
the
right
to
use
the
subject
matter
of
an
expired
patent
is
in
violation
of
the
fundamental
principle
that
it
patent
this
for
a
limited
term,
and
that
when
it
expires,
the
inventions
is
dedicated.
have
i
answered
you
at
all?
mr.
edward
s.
irons
oh,
if
he
had
built
the
machine
himself,
he's
still
would
have
had
to
pay
royalties.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
and
he
had
to
pay
royalties
whether
he
used
the
machine
or
any
machine
or
not.
and
he
had
to
pay
royalties
that
based
on
the
extent
of
the
use
of
a
portable
hop-picking
machine,
so
it's
the
specific
one
so,
but
in
any
event,
a
minimum
royalty
even
if
he
junked
his
machine
and
he
couldn't
cancel.
he
has
no
right
to
cancel
during
the
term.
the
court
below
expressly
held
that
so
he
would
have
accomplished
nothing
by
building
his
own
machine.
he
will
still
under
this
royalty
obligation
at
least
just
to
the
minimum
which
was
substantial
in
the
economics
i
believe
of
the
hop
farmers.
it
was
$500
a
year.
there
were
200
of
these
contracts,
200
contracts
at
$500
a
year
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
that
i
think
is
based
on
the
--
on
an
answer
given
by
the
respondents
on
trial
record.
the
only
fact
i
can
answer
mr.
justice
white
is
the
royalty
apparently
was
reduced
from
$5
to
$3.33.b
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
choice
except
this
one
answer
of
the
respondent
thys
and
i
really
--
what
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
if
mr.
thys
had
arranged
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
i'll
answer
quite
--
of
course
any
questions.
let
me
make
my
point
this
way.
i
don't
think
the
terms
or
the
length
of
the
terms
is
important
if
to
any
extent
it
goes
beyond
the
expiration
of
the
patent
and
requires
the
payment
of
royalties
for
the
right
to
use
a
patent
which
has
expired.
now,
if
mr.
thys
meant
by
that
that
he
would
have
limited
his
agreements
so
that
no
royalties
became
due
for
the
right
to
use
patents
after
the
expired,
then
of
course
there's
no
problem.
but
a
mere
shortening
of
term
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
coincident
with
the
expiration
of
the
patents.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
and
it
make
it
down
pretty
much
to
matter
of
form
that
i
think
its
in
a
very
important
matter.
if
you
agree
that
the
price,
the
fair
value
for
the
right
to
use
your
patent
for
10
years,
let
say
its
$10,000
and
the
royalty
is
charged
only
for
the
right
to
use
it
during
those
10
years,
i
do
not
contend
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
that
even
though,
as
a
matter
of
economics
you
say,
“alright,
i
will
let
you
pay
it
over
20.”
but
if
you
contract
and
say,
“i
will
let
you
use
my
patent.
i
will
charge
you
a
royalty
for
the
right
to
use
it
for
a
period
of
10
years
after
it
expires."
to
get
to
the
$10,000
you
have
extended
the
monopoly
and
this
is
particularly
aggravated
when
the
royalty
is
based
on
the
extent
of
use
because
we
get
into
use
after
expiration
as
the
royalty
based.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
you
mean
the
right
to
use
them?
mr.
edward
s.
irons
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
treat
hazeltine
specifically
this
way.
all
hazeltine
held
and
the
statement
in
hazeltine
is
clear
was
that
it
was
not
per
se
illegal
to
base
royalties
on
the
total
volume
of
the
licensees
sales.
the
next
preceding
paragraph
made
it
clear
that
what
was
being
spoken
off
there
was
existing
patents.
i
read
existing
to
mean
unexpired
patents.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
was
not
decided
in
hazeltine.
my
point
your
honor
is
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
the
use
are
not
lust
and
i
agree,
you
can
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes.
let's
look
at
it
in
another
context
if
i
may
please.
at
the
beginning
there
were
--
let
say
12
patents.
seven
were
used,
some
were
not
used.
the
royalty
rate
was
fixed
at
that
time
at
$5
per
bale
plus
$500
a
year,
minimum
royalty.
this
royalty
was
for
package.
obviously,
and
as
the
court
below
i
think
found,
the
primary
consideration
for
that
royalty
was
for
the
patents
that
were
used.
it
had
to
be,
because
there
weren't
any
others
used.
the
court
below
said
there
was
no
interests
in
the
ones
that
there
were
not
used.
now,
they
expired.
nobody
ever
used
them.
at
the
beginning,
these
$5
a
bale
and
$500
a
year
minimum
was
in
part
allocable
certainly,
if
not
entirely
to
the
patents
which
were
used
after
they
expire.
you
have
to
make
a
reallocation
of
this
royalty
and
say,
“now,
we're
going
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
money
for
patents
we
don't
need.”
this
was
never
contemplated
in
the
minds
of
the
parties.
they
didn't
pay
anything
and
had
no
intention
of
paying
anything
for
the
right
to
use
these
patents
they
didn't
need.
but
more
particularly,
in
the
context
of
package
licenses
when
this
court
has
considered
it
particularly
in
paramount
in
laws,
it
is
repeated
again
and
again.
each
patent
must
stand
on
its
own
feet.
you
must
not
borrow
quality
one
from
the
other.
you
must
be
able
to
deal
with
them
individually
in
the
market
place.
certainly,
these
patents
that
were
needed
barred
quality
from
the
ones
that
were
--
or
it
wouldn't
be
paying
for
them
years
after
the
ones
that
were
needed
expired.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
don't
think
hazeltine
is
relevant
to
this
situation.
i
don't
think
it
decided
at
any
issue
involved
in
this
case.
i
don't
put
it
off
to
one
side.
it's
an
important
case
that
has
been
argued
by
the
respondent
here,
that
the
issue
and
the
consequences
of
patent
expiration
was
not
decided,
and
the
fact
that
the
unexpired
patents
borrowed
quality
from
the
needed
and
the
expired
ones
was
not
considered
in
that
case.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
would
say
so,
if
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
well,
it's
been
almost
universally
held
as
i
understand
it
your
honor
that
patents
which
are
misused
are
enforceable.
if
these
patents
are
misused,
they're
part
of
the
package.
the
license
agreement
on
its
face
says,
“it's
indivisible”.
the
agreement
on
its
face
went
it
was
drawn
required
post-expiration
royalty
contracts.
i
don't
think
there's
any
equity
here
which
would
justify
a
change
of
that
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
s.
irons
i
--
mr.
edward
s.
irons
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
you
--
entirely.
i
realize
i'm
overtime,
may
i
answer
it?
mr.
edward
s.
irons
the
point
is
this
your
honor.
if
you're
dealing
with
an
individual
patent,
the
problem
is
simple.
it
may
come
very
close
to
that
as
long
as
it's
done
right.
but
if
you
have
a
package
of
patents,
you
certainly
are
going
to
have
to
make
provisions
in
that
package
license
so
that
the
royalties
are
reduced
as
they
expire
or
some
other
provision
is
put
into
these
agreements
so
that
the
paramount
right
and
the
dedicated
invention
is
not
compromised.
and
in
the
context
of
a
package
license,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
mere
draftsmanship,
it
is
a
matter
of
substance.
because
when
you
continue
the
royalty
at
an
undiminished
rate
after
the
patents
which
were
--
the
primary
appeal
expire,
you
certainly
indulge
in
post-expiration
royalties
as
to
those
patents.
they
borrow
--
the
unexpired
ones
borrow
quality
from
the
expired
ones.
i
won't
repeat
myself.
