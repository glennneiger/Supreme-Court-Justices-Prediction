chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
and
also
with
sadness
that
the
court
receives
from
you
the
news
of
the
passing
of
this
great
american.
president
hoover
had
a
long
and
purposeful
life.
one
of
dedication,
dedicated
service
to
this
nation
and
to
the
world,
people
of
every
race,
on
every
continent
of
the
earth
are
indebted
to
him
for
alleviating
much
of
their
suffering
which
resulted
from
the
two
most
devastating
wars
in
history.
i
am
sure
that
they
too
had
mourned
his
passing
as
we
do.
it
is
appropriate
therefore
that
you
mr.
solicitor
general
should
make
this
motion
and
the
court
takes
some
consolation
from
the
fact
that
it
can
in
granting
it
pay
its
respect
and
veneration
to
his
memory.
accordingly,
the
court
would
transact
no
further
business
today
and
will
stand
adjourned
until
tomorrow.
