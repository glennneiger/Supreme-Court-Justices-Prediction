justice

stewart
of
course,
presumably,
if
the
statute
under
which
the
appellants
were
convicted
is
unconstitutional,
so
would
be
the
anti-miscegenation
statute.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reasoning
is
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
the
pace
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reasoning
of
the
court,
at
least
part
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
the
pace
case
was
the
same
as
that
suggested
in
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
yesterday.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
that
both
the
negro
and
the
white
person
were
punished
equally,
neither
one
was
discriminated
against
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
are
asking
us
flatly
to
reject
that
part
of
the
reasoning
of
the
pace
case,
are
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
--
under
that
act,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
negro
restaurant.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
you're
basic
position
is
that
--
well,
you
say
it's
the
most
important
issue,
you
began
by
saying
it's
not
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
your
first
argument
is
that
that
issue
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
us
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
because
these
people
--
it's
clear,
were
married
to
two
other
people.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
as
a
matter
of
reading
the
words,
this
statute
would
apply
to
a
mother
and
her
son
occupying
the
same
room
if
the
mother
happened
to
have
a
negro
husband,
in
another
state,
the
son
therefore
would
be
half-negro,
the
mother
would
be
white,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
could
apply,
isn't
it,
by
its
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
mahorner,
can
you
conceive
of
this
--
of
an
opinion
by
this
court
holding
this
particular
criminal
statute
unconstitutional
which
wouldn't
almost
a
fortiori
imply
that
any
anti-miscegenation
statute
was
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
--
now,
forgetting
the
vagueness
around
it?
justice
potter
stewart
forgetting
the
vagueness
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
how
that
--
how
could
that
happen,
people
who
think
they're
married
and
then
they're
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
it
allows
you
to
dessert
your
wife
without
--
a
person
who
would
otherwise
be
your
wife
without
getting
a
divorce,
probably.
justice
potter
stewart
it
allows
a
man
to
dessert
the
woman
who,
if
she
were
the
same
race,
would
be
his
wife
without
getting
a
divorce.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
point.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
understand
your
point.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
at
first.
you
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
emphasizing,
mr.
mahorner,
in
this
part
of
your
argument
the
tremendous
importance,
as
i
gather,
to
the
state
of
florida.
this
case
and
yet
if,
as
you
say,
florida
recognizes
interracial
marriages
contracted
outside
the
state,
is
this
really
very
important?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
your
point
as
to
the
impact,
great
or
small,
upon
existing
statuses
and
property
relationships
but,
as
to
the
public
policy
of
florida
or
as
to
any
future
action
in
view
of
the
fact
that
florida
recognizes,
any
kind
of
--
this
kind
of
a
marriage
contracted
outside
the
state,
i
find
difficulty
in
seeing
that
this
is
really
very
important
at
all
as
a
practical
matter
in
contrast
to
the
case
like
brown
against
board
of
education
to
which
you've
been
referring.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
need
to
make
quite
so
broad
an
argument?
how
about
a
statute
that
required
segregation
of
races
in
a
--
in
a
state
prison?
justice
potter
stewart
of
association
with
other
races,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
assume
that
the
physical
--
all
the
facilities
were
exactly
equal,
except
we
have
this
separation,
that's
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
this
case,
but
i
was
just
testing
out
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
should
need
to
make
so
broad
argument.
