mr.
james
g.
mahorner
good
morning
chief
justice.
i'm
james
mahorner,
assistant
attorney
general,
will
represent
the
appellee,
state
of
florida,
in
this
cause.
i
would
first,
just
to
wind
up,
i'd
liked
to
briefly
touch
on
the
facts
with
the
observation
that,
though
it
was
hearsay
evidence
for
the
proposition
that
these
defendants
were
married
to
each
--
to
other
people
and
if
they
were
not
married
to
each
other
and
that
they
were
negro
and
white
respectively,
that
all
such
hearsay
evidence
was
in
the
form
of
admissions.
while
as
far
as
the
hearsay
evidence
concerning
their
being
married
to
each
other,
it
was
hearsay
evidence
relating
to
the
representation
of
one
party
which
bore
no
admission
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
is
not
material
evidence
in
this
cause.
and,
therefore,
we
have
for
the
purpose
of
this
record
before
this
court
ample
evidence,
legal
in
nature,
that
these
parties
were
not
married
and
we
have
not
one
iota
of
evidence
when
we
consider,
limited
by
the
rules
of
law,
as
to
what
constitutes
evidence,
not
one
iota
of
evidence
that
these
parties
were
married
to
each
other.
so,
with
that
distinguishing
feature
and
with
the
realization
that
the
court
can
well
review
the
evidence
that
we
cite,
show
--
to
show
the
proposition
that
these
negroes
were
--
these
parties
were
negro
and
white
and
that
they
were
not
married
to
each
other,
according
to
what
was
the
evidence
has
shown,
i
will
proceed
into
the
argument.
the
case
is
before
this
court
on
three
propositions.
the
one
we
will
take
first,
and
i'll
give
them
in
the
order
that
we
will
give
in
the
brief,
is
first,
the
interracial
marriage,
the
constitutionality
of
the
florida
constitution
provision
which
prohibits
interracial
marriage.
the
second
is
to
do
with
discriminatory
co
--
aspects
of
section
798.05,
florida
statutes
under
which
the
accused
were
prosecuted
which
prohibited
cohabitation
between
negro
and
white
couples
who
were
not
married.
and,
the
third
is
the
concept
of
the
statute
798.05
is
unconstitutional
because
it's
ambiguous
and
it
has
used
the
term
“negro”.
now,
first,
to
take
the
first
one,
the
one
that
we
conceive
of
as
most
important
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
article
16
section
24
of
the
florida
constitution
which
prohibits
--
which
prohibits
interracial
marriage
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
your
honor.
i
said
it's
the
most
important
position
or
issue
because
i
feel
it
has
the
most
impact
on
the
client
which
i
represent.
but,
as
far
as
the
most
important
issue
to
the
case,
i
would
well
submit
that
the
issue
is
not
in
the
case.
but
because
of
the
potential
impact
on
the
client
that
i
represent,
i
submit
that,
to
my
client,
it
is
the
most
important
and
that's
why
i
wish
to
take
it
first,
but
it's
a
different
concept
and
most
important.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
absolutely.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
your
honor,
again,
we
would
have
been
in
a
position
of
having
to
prove
the
negative.
these
parties
never
got
divorced
anywhere
in
the
world
and
it
was
an
impossible
situation,
and
i
will
go
into
that
in
the
second
point.
the
impossibility
of
the
state
proving
the
negative
in
certain
instances
where
the
positive
is
--
the
state
is
not
required
to
prove
it,
given
the
case
is
decided
where
the
positive
is
well-known
by
the
two
who
are
accused
and
can
be
easily
proven.
but
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
but
even
that
would
not
have
prevented
them
from
getting
a
divorce
elsewhere.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
but
if
the
term
is
less
than
two
months
in
many
states,
as
i
understand
it,
or
less
than
three.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
justice
clark,
our
position
would
be,
and
we
give
this
concession,
i
believe,
advisedly
and
adding
also
to
the
court,
we
should
conceive
this
that,
if
the
state
had
to
prove
that
these
people
were
not
married,
that
they
were
entitled
to
that
question
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
that
perhaps
the
instruction
limited,
and
it
wouldn't
matter
how
much
evidence
we
put
on.
and
so,
our
burden
would
be
to
show
as
a
manner
of
law
that
in
this
area,
we
didn't
have
to
prove
at
all
that
they
carried
the
burden
and
the
amount
of
evidence
that
the
state
actually
put
on
only
has
emotional
aspects.
as
far
as
the
actual
legal
question,
if
the
state
was
under
the
burden
to
proof,
then
the
jury
--
they
had
the
right
to
have
a
jury
to
decide
and,
if
the
state
was
not
under
the
burden,
then
they
had
to
put
on
some
evidence
to
carry
their
burden
and
there
is
no
legal
evidence
in
this
record
which
could
possibly
sustain
any
burden
of
proving
that
they
were
married
because
none
of
the
evidence,
even
if
all
that
was
believed,
would
show
that
they
were
married.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
and
i
am
citing
multiple
cases
for
that
proposition
and
i
will
go
--
yes,
sir.
now,
our
first
approach
was
the
background
to
the
federal
constitution
beginning
with
the
introduction
of
freedmen's
bureau
bill
in
january
of
1866.
and,
we
show
there
that
this
bill
which
guaranteed
the
same
civil
rights
to
negroes
that
white
people
had
at
that
time,
that
during
the
debates
of
this
bill,
the
question
came
up
--
the
question
came
up
before
all
considering
as
to
whether
this
bill
would
prohibit
state
--
the
enactment
of
state
anti-miscegenation
provisions.
and,
the
conclusion
was
that
it
would
not
so
prohibit
and
the
rationale
given
was
the
same
rationale
recognized
by
this
court
in
pace
v.
alabama
to
whit
that
there
was
no
discrimination
because
both
parties
stood
equal
and
they
were
equally
prohibited
from
engaging
in
this
particular
enterprise.
then,
approximately
april
1866,
the
civil
rights
bill
came
in.
and,
surrounding
that
bill
was
the
same
--
same
argument
and
the
same
conclusion
reached
that
it
was
not
touched
state
anti-miscegenation
statutes.
and
then,
the
same
people,
in
june
of
1866,
just
a
few
months
later,
and
it
proposed
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
it
proposed
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
they
said,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
multiple
statements
before
the
whole
group
say
that
purpose
of
this
bill
was
to
place
the
civil
rights
bill
into
the
constitution
so
that
it
could
not
be
repealed
by
just
the
majority
and
that
it
was,
in
effect,
just
the
first
provision
the
con
--
of
the
constitutional
provision,
section
1,
was
in
effect
identical
to
the
civil
rights
provision.
these
were
the
observations
given.
these
were
the
observations
set
out
in
our
brief.
now,
we
submit
that
it
was
not
the
intent,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
the
intent
--
proposing
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
such
amendment
would
prohibit
state
anti-miscegenation
laws.
now,
they
have
come
forth
with
the
idea
--
well,
this
argument
was
thrown
aside
with
brown.
but,
we
can
distinguish
brown
and
brown
itself
well
sets
out
how
it's
distinguished.
the
rationale
of
brown
makes
its
own
distinguishing
feature.
that
rationale
is
that
education
has
developed
and
it
is
no
longer
like
it
was
then,
and
the
intent
then
applied
to
something
that
is
no
longer
even
in
existence
today
because
it
has
so
changed.
and,
the
intent
then
is
not
controlling
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed
because
education
has
developed
to
such
a
place
where
it
is
no
longer
the
same
beast
and
the
intent
to
control
it
--
that
was
controlling
it
to
the
former
beast
is
no
longer
controlling
as
to
this
newborn
beast,
but
what
about
marriage?
there
has
been
no
development
in
marriage.
there
has
been
no
development
in
marriage
and
be
comparable
to
education.
there
has
been
no
development
at
all.
it
is
the
same
institution,
and
the
intent
that
was
controlling
then
must
control
now.
and,
if
we
are
to
give
the
legislature
the
right
of
way
in
this
area
and
recognize
that
intent,
that
intent
which
was
then
should
be
given
recognition
today
and
it
does
not
matter
what
we
ourselves,
as
members
of
a
judiciary
or
bar,
believe
should
be
done
in
the
legislative
branch.
the
thing
is
that
they
didn't
intend
that
that
be
done,
and
it
wasn't
done.
and,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
ruled
by
the
educational
cases.
now,
they
have
brought
in
the
general
cases
to
do
with
prohibitions
of
boxing,
the
prohibitions
to
golf
matches
where
the
prohibition
was
to
prohibit
whites
and
negroes
from
engaging
together
in
this
particular
sport.
but
in
each
of
those
cases,
that
was
under
the
brown
decision
going
to
separate
facilities
are
inherently
unequal,
and
please,
i
hope
i
can
get
this
analogy
clear.
in
brown,
the
statute
prohibited,
they're
attending
the
same
schools
but
it
could
have
prohibited
them
from
studying
together
and
have
had
the
same
effect.
by
prohibiting
them
from
studying
together,
it
would
have
resulted
in
there
having
separate
facility
at
the
schools.
under
these
athletic
cases
where
they
are
prohibited
from
going
into
golf
matches
in
city
courses
together,
it
wasn't
limited
to
city
courses
but
it
concern
city
courses,
the
effect
is
--
where
they
were
prohibited
from
boxing
together
under
a
state
organized
boxing
games,
state
facilities
in
the
boxing,
the
idea
was
that
the
effect
of
that
was
to
cause
the
facilities
to
be
separate
just
like,
if
under
the
brown
decision,
the
statute
had
prohibited
them
from
studying
together.
they
would
not
have
made
any
difference
in
the
decision
but,
what
about
marriage?
the
rationale
is
not
applicable
there
because,
with
interracial
marriage,
there
is
no
separate
facility.
it
is
the
same
facility
denied
to
each.
it's
the
same
facility
denied
to
each.
now,
they
say
that
the
idea
of
voting
was
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
know
the
fifteenth
was
brought
in.
now,
as
far
as
the
fourteenth
application,
it
has
been
given
--
it's
been
deemed
by
this
court
to
give
equal
rights
of
voting,
but
the
arguments
given
by
howard
of
michigan
did
not
say
it
didn't
give
equal
rights
of
voting.
it
just
said
it
didn't
guarantee
voting.
the
voting
was
said
to
be
guaranteed
by
the
fifteenth
which
was
found
necessary
to
be
enacted
later
because
the
fourteenth
didn't
guarantee
this
right.
as
far
as
the
jury
question,
it
says
that
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
excuse
me.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
absolutely.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
submit
there
would
be,
and
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
the
difference
there
is
that
they're
each
denied
different
things
and
one
is
given
one
thing
and
one
is
given
another
by
the
very
terms
of
the
statute
itself.
the
terms
of
the
statute
give
one
person
a
right
in
one
and
one
the
right
in
the
other,
but
in
this
interracial
statute,
it
doesn't
give
one
a
right
in
one
and
one
a
right
in
another.
it
prohibits
both
the
interracial
marriage
and
that
is
what's
prohibited.
and,
we
submit
that
it
may
well
be
argued
that
these
two
aren't
distinguishable,
as
suggested
--
not
as
suggested
but
in
regards
to
the
question
put
forth
by
the
chief
justice.
but,
we
submit
that
they
are
distinguishable
because
one
involves
the
different
facilities,
but
here,
the
facility
is
the
same.
and,
to
have
the
state
say
“you
are
excluded
from
this
area
and
you
are
excluded
from
this
area”
is
a
different
aspect
than
to
say,
“you
are
both
excluded
from
this
area”,
and
that's
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
--
what's
involved
here.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
well
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
it
would
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
still
distinguishable.
the
thing
that
would
be
on
point
directly
would
be
if
they
took
a
particular
house
in
the
city
square
and
said
nobody
can
go
in
that
house.
and,
that's
what
they've
done
here,
and
that
is
not
distinguishable
and
anything
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
--
else
is
distinguishable.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
sir,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
is
very
pertinent.
it
has
never
been
approached
directly
in
their
brief
but
i
find
some
weakness
in
the
fact
that
it's
limited
to
only
two
races
rather
than
all
races.
but,
it
seems
that
the
florida
legislature
has
taken
the
problem
which
they
had
and
it
did
not
concern
chinese
and
it
may
also
be
presented
that
they
conceived
of
only
two
races,
the
negro
and
the
white.
and
that
others
may
conceive
it
more,
but
they
conceive
it
two.
and,
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
they
have
adopted
the
argument
that
there
were
only
two
races.
but
a
people
may
differ,
that
maybe
there
are
three,
and
some
say
there
are
five,
and
i
think
one
only
says
there's
six.
but
here,
they
have
conceived
of
it
as
two,
as
everybody
included
in
two
races,
and
the
--
both
races
were
equally
prohibited
from
the
same
house
and
i
do
think
that
the
strongest
argument
they
could
have
presented
was
to
point
out
the
chinese
were
the
favored
group,
but
that's
not
the
argument
presented,
but
i
do
think
it
has
great
merit,
and
the
court
should
consider
that
argument.
but
all
i
could
say,
and
i've
put
some
thought
on
it,
that
this
legislature
of
florida,
be
it
in
its
power,
has
said
that
there
are
two
races
and
that
those
of
one
cannot
enter
marriage
and
those,
the
other,
that
there
is
only
one
possible
house
and
that's
this
house
and
everybody
is
prohibited
from
that,
and,
it's
like
a
building,
or
a
square,
or
where
have
you
and
it's
just
all
(inaudible).
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
sir,
because
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
the
federal
constitution
did
not
--
would
simply
intent
--
could
not
support
not
prohibiting
jews
and
gentiles
but
the
intent
set
out
by
the
very
record
itself
supports
the
idea
that
this
constitutional
provision
permits
this
very
type
of
statute,
this
statute
to
do
with
negro
and
white,
and
this
is
the
statute
discussed.
and
no
one
could
come
up
with
the
same
argument
has
to
do
with
jews
and
gentiles,
but
the
thing
or
this
intent
set
out
has
to
do
with
negro-white
and
that
was
the
intent
expressed
just
prior
to
the
passing
of
the
fourteenth,
within
two
months,
and
the
analogy
of
adopting
what
it
already
proceeded
and
was
formally
discussed
in
regards
to
such
intent.
and
so,
we
submit
that
it
would
--
you
could
not
make
the
same
argument
in
relations
to
jews
and
gentiles
even
though
each
church
of
both
may
interfere
with
the
marriage
with
the
other.
but,
as
far
as
the
state,
it
could
not
be
done.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
had
mis
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
if
that
was
the
question,
i
had
misconceived
it.
did
i
understood
that
it
was
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
that
no
negro
or
white
could
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
right.
there,
we
have
a
clear
case
of
a
property
right.
that
has
already
been
discussed
in
former
cases
dealing
with
like
shelley
v.
kraemer
or
with
a
statute
--
a
city
ordinance
prohibiting
living
in
certain
areas.
those
would
be
the
same.
the
--
it
would
be
the
same
aspect
and
it's
prohibiting
one
from
utilizing
the
very
property
right,
a
real
property
right,
that
he
has
and
it's
recognized
under
the
constitution.
they
might
be
able
to
do
that
if
they
found
some
kind
of
disease
that
it's
only
transmitted
between
the
two,
but
even
if
they
did
that,
they
might
well
had
to
pay
for
sort
of
an
imminent
domain
payment
for
the
taking
of
the
property
right.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
absolutely.
but
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
this
case
is
distinguished
because
it
is
a
real
property
right
to
have
in
your
home
whom
you
won't,
whom
you
wish
and
that
is
a
real
property
right
and
quite
within
the
intent
of
the
federal
constitution,
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but,
the
argument
set
out,
i
think,
may
clearly
indicate
that
they
never
intended
that
this
constitutional
amendment
would
prohibit
interracial
marriage
statutes.
and,
if
that
was
their
intent,
i
feel
we
must
honor
it,
no
matter
how
important
it
is
to
us,
if
that
was
their
intent.
now,
if
we
can
fairly
conclude
they
didn't
intend
that,
that's
one
thing.
but,
if
we
can
only
conclude
that
they
did
intend
it
this
way
to
favor
my
particular
client,
to
let
him
enact
the
state
anti-miscegenation
statutes
and
they
say
--
if
that's
so,
we
find
that
important
to
us,
i
don't
think
we
can
change
it
here,
and
that's
the
difference.
and,
it's
not
important
to
that
constitutional
provision
in
regards
to
the
historical
facts
surrounding
it
that
the
state
be
prohibited
from
telling
one
man
that
he
can't
have
another
man
on
his
property.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
would
say
like
the
interracial
--
like
the
restaurant
cases?
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
the
argument
still
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
the
argument
still
prevails
because
if
the
third
party
did
not
want
them
on
there,
they
could
be
prosecuted.
and,
if
he
did
want
them
on
there
and
they
could
not
come
on
there
because
of
the
statute,
then
his
rights
are
again
interfered
with.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
sir,
if
they
can
prosecute
a
guest,
if
you
have
them
on,
i
submit
that
it's
the
same
limitation
on
your
property
right
as
if
they
could
prosecute
you
for
having
them
on.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
okay,
there,
we
go
to
a
moral
concept.
under
the
state
--
under
the
state
right
to
prohibit
interracial
or
non-interracial
commingling
of
sexual
--
of
the
sexes
in
such
a
manner
that
it
may
produce
or
is
conducive
that
has
a
high
potential
of
producing
illegitimate
offspring,
and
that
becomes
a
different
concept.
i
think
that
if
they
could
prohibit
a
man
with
typhoid
from
coming
onto
your
property,
under
the
same
concept,
without
interfering
with
your
property
right.
but
there,
you
get
under
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
it
does
have
to
do
with
sexual
intercourse,
your
honor.
it
does
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
now,
let
me
not
mislead
you.
let
me
clarify
because
my
answer
may
not
really
be
an
entirely
response
to
your
question.
there
is
no
case
in
the
state
of
florida
which
indicates
that
798.05
does
not
require
--
which
holds
the
798.05
does
not
require
proof
of
intercourse.
however,
the
state
felt
that
it
would
be
entirely
unfair
if
they
take
that
position
because
the
cases
indicate
by
this,
wildman
v.
state,
257
so.2d.
there
is
a
prosecution
under
both
798.02
and
798.05.
they
said
that,
in
798.02,
they
had
held
that
intercourse
was
necessary.
they
did
not
make
any
finding
as
to
798.05.
they
didn't
say
that
they
didn't
hold
it,
but
i
think
there's
a
fair
inference
that
they
don't
require
intercourse
in
798.05
and
i
didn't
feel
that
i
could
argue
this.
so,
i
think,
on
a
strict
and
logical
position
maybe
it
would
hold
up.
but
the
idea
is,
though
this
statute
does
not
require
the
proving
of
a
particular
intercourse
anymore
than
some
divorce
statutes
that
are
--
of
course
the
courts
require
that
you
prove
the
adultery
by
an
intercourse
even
though
that's
an
element
of
adultery.
all
you
have
to
show
is
they
have
potential
position,
and
for
a
man
and
a
woman
to
live
in
the
same
room
continually,
night
in
and
night
out,
i
submit
that
is
a
position
of
the
highest
potential.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
i
agree
that,
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
in
this
--
in
this
case,
they
requested
no
reference
and
he
made
no
reference,
but
that
is
not
a
holding
specifically
that
negates
that
this
statute
does
not
require
intercourse,
but
let
me
say
that
i
--
that
would
be
my
considerate
opinion
that
the
statute
would
not.
i'm
just
saying
that
there
is
no
holding
that
specifically
holds
that
this
statute,
789.05,
does
not
require
the
element
of
intercourse.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
that's
well
reasoned
and
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
not
considered
it
and
i
could
not
give
an
answer,
your
honor.
i
just
could
not
give
an
answer
to
that.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
as
far
as
i
can
see,
the
statute
does
apply.
i
think
the
question
is
well
put
forth.
now,
as
regards
to
the
question
of
whether
the
actual
question
of
interracial
marriage
is
present
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
present
for
this
reason.
first,
it
arose
by
--
it
was
never
in
the
case
until
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
and
he
instructed
the
jury
that
these
defendants
could
not
contract
a
common
law
marriage
in
this
state.
they
could
not
contract
a
common
law
marriage
in
this
state.
now,
in
reference
to
what
was
submitted
by
justice
stewart,
florida
recognizes
marriages
outside
the
state
between
negro
and
white.
if
the
person
gets
married
outside
the
state,
the
marriage
is
fully
recognized,
and
if
this
would
make
an
exception,
it
well
could.
i
have
not
studied
out
the
possibility
like
i
was
defending
such
client
as
well-possible
as
since
the
marriage
is
recognized
in
a
manner
of
law
and
the
children
are
legitimate,
that
they'd
--
it'd
be
well
an
exception
under
the
statute
and
they
could
live
together
in
the
same
room.
but,
the
only
way
it's
limitation
on
the
defendants
was
that
he
could
not
contract
a
common
law
marriage
in
the
state.
it's
not
that
he
could
not
contract
a
formal
marriage.
it
was
not
that
he
could
not
go
out
of
the
state
and
contract
either
formal
or
a
common
law
marriage.
it
was
strictly
the
common
law
marriage
in
the
state.
there
was
no
objection
made
to
that
instruction,
none
whatsoever.
now,
they've
given
the
(inaudible)
as
the
only
--
as
this
court
proposition,
they
didn't
have
to
object
because
when
you
attack
the
statute,
then
you
don't
have
to
object
to
an
instruction
that
goes
to
interpreting
the
statute.
but,
the
weakness
in
that
argument
is
that
they
were
not
attacking
the
statute
concerned
in
the
instruction.
they
were
attacking
a
statute
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
anti-miscegenation.
and
therefore,
the
(inaudible)
exception
to
the
requirement
of
the
instruction
is
not
applicable
here
because
these
people
were
not
attacking
the
uncon
--
the
miscegenation
statutes
of
florida
as
unconstitutional
in
this
case.
and,
this
instruction
was
to
a
collateral
aspect
and
was
not
directly
raised
by
a
motion
to
quash
which
attacked
directly
798.05,
which
was
not
concerned
in
the
instructions.
so,
there
is
no
ground
to
overlook
the
fact
that
they
made
no
objection
to
this
instruction
and
section
918.10
florida
statute
sets
out
the
court
should
not
consider
as
instruct
--
the
question
of
whether
the
instruction
is
erroneous,
should
not
consider
on
appeal
whether
it
is
erroneous
--
the
question
is
whether
is
erroneous
if
there
was
no
objection
made
to
it,
and
the
exception
is
not
applicable
here.
now,
furthermore,
florida
does
not
reverse
cases
just
for
error,
they
reversed
only
if
the
error
was
harmful.
now,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
instruction
was
erroneous
and
it
deprives
them
of
the
defense
of
a
common
law
marriage.
well,
that
was
only
harmful
if
they
were
entitled
to
that
defense.
and
if
the
burden
was
on
them
to
prove
it,
then
--
and
they
did
not
prove
it,
they
were
not
entitled
to
that
defense.
and
the
--
we
have
submitted
at
least
five
cases
on
the
proposition,
one
from
this
court
concerning
a
prosecution
for
an
unregistered
still
and
the
court
held
that
the
federal
government
did
not
have
to
prove
that
the
still
was
unregistered,
that
the
burden
was
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
was
registered.
and
then,
we
go
into
cases
just
about
squarely
on
point,
and
that's
pace
v.
u.s.
which
concerned
--
concern
a
prosecution
under
the
mann
act.
and
in
that
case,
defendant
was
prosecuted
for
taking
a
woman
across
state
lines
for
immoral
purposes
to
which
--
to
pay
her
to
engage
in
sexual
intercourse
with.
and
when
it
came
up
on
appeal,
the
question
was
presented,
there
was
no
proof
that
these
parties
were
married
--
were
not
--
were
not
married
and
that
if
they
had
been
married,
the
conduct
would
not
have
been
immoral
and
that
it
was
on
--
the
burden
was
on
the
prosecution
to
prove
the
immorality
of
the
conduct,
and
they
had
not
done
so.
and
this
federal
court
answered,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
answered
that
the
burden
in
a
case
involving
a
defensive
marriage
is
on
the
defendants
because
they
have
peculiar
knowledge
as
to
whether
a
marriage
exist
and
it
is
impossible
for
the
prosecution
--
impossible
for
the
prosecution
itself
to
prove
that
these
people
have
never
married
anywhere
in
the
world
at
any
time.
and,
this
same
concept
is
recognized
by
no
lesser
work
than
cjs
53
lewdness
--
53
cjs
involving
lewdness
in
section
5,
and
the
same
principle
is
set
forth
there.
and
this
isn't
an
unusual
principle.it
is
a
well
recognized
principle,
and
if
--
if
the
burden
was
on
them
to
prove
it,
then
the
state
was
entitled
to
this
instruction.
they
were
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
the
burden
was
on
the
defendants
and
they
were
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
as
a
manner
of
law,
no
proof
have
been
given.
and,
the
defense
would
have
been
deprived
of
this
defense
of
marriage
by
that
set
of
instructions,
and
what
harm
is
it
that
they
were
deprived
for
the
same
defense
that
they
could
have
been
correct
--
could
have
been
deprived
for,
for
a
correct
reason
when
they
were
deprived
of
it,
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
for
an
erroneous
reason
we'll
assume,
to
with
the
validity
of
florida
miscegenation
provisions
or
the
application
of
florida
miscegenation
provision.
and
so
we
submit
that
under
that
rationale,
the
case
is
not
before
the
court.
it's
not
before
the
court
because
they
are
to
object.
and,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
first,
before
we
go
on,
that
these
defendants
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
this
case
as
a
general
fantasy
of
what
they
conceive
of
the
social
wrongs
or
a
vehicle
that
attack
everything.
if
the
statute
on
which
they're
prosecuted
was
unconstitutional,
our
argument
with
the
defendants
has
ceased
and
they
are
with
it,
and
there
is
no
real
issue.
our
argument
is
ceased.
they'd
have
their
remedy
and
there
is
no
issue
between
the
defendants
and
the
state
of
florida.
if
the
court
--
if
the
court
would
have
to
go
on
and
keep
the
case
into
effect
to
reach
this,
then
we
submit
that
only
one
issue
should
be
reached
in
this
case,
one
or
two
but
we
--
if
they
determine
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
under
which
these
people
were
prosecuted,
the
question
of
miscegenation
would
arise.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes
sir,
i
can.
i
should
answer
this
accordingly.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
no,
i
understand
that.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
understand
--
i
understood
what
you
meant.
if
a
constitutional
prov
--
in
setting
up
a
constitutional
provision,
the
legislature
clearly
indicates
their
intent
that
they
don't
mean
it
to
affect
one
area.
but
they'd
failed
to
indicate
the
intent
that
it's
not
to
affect
another
area.
the
court
might
well
say
that
we'll
give
the
words
a
logical
application
in
this
area
where
there
was
no
expression
of
intent,
but
we
can't
carry
it
over
in
this
other
one.
now,
where
is
that
applicable
here?
they
haven't
even
given
no
clear
--
they've
given
--
by
a
reference,
you
might
adopt
the
same
rationale
over,
but
they
gave
no
clear
discussion
of
state
statutes
prohibiting
this
general
intercourse
or
prohibiting
general
cohabitation.
they
went
directly
to
state's
statutes
prohibiting
miscegenation
and
there
we
submit
the
intent
is
controlling
and
it
may
not
be
controlling
as
the
other.
and
we
may
feel
we
can
do
one
thing,
and
we
cannot
do
other.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
your
honor,
i
indicated
that
you
could
well,
by
reference,
bring
it
over.
i
was
only
answering
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
regards
to
the
possibility
of
distinguishing.
but
one
--
you
have
to
bring
it
over
by
reference
and
one
is
direct,
and
that's
the
only
example
we
were
given
as
a
possibility.
we
don't
argue
that
it
shouldn't
be
taken
over
by
reference.
we
have
even
suggested
in
our
brief
that
the
power
to
prohibit
marriage
is
nothing
but
the
power
to
prohibit
sexual
relations
or
to
refuse
to
sanction
them,
and
that
they
are
closely
related
--
the
punishment
of
unsanctioned
sexual
relations
are
closely
related
to
the
power
to
prohibit
marriage
and
that
maybe
they
should
be
carried
over.
and
i
think
--
i
think
it's
an
excellent
argument.
i
think
the
better
rationale
is
that
if
the
stat
--
the
section
14
of
the
federal
constitution
did
not
mean
to
prohibit
miscegenation,
it
was
their
intent
that
those
statutes
could
go
ahead,
i
think
it's
excellent
to
say
that
they
--
i
mean,
it's
an
--
that
you
can
reasonably
transfer
that
over
and
say
that
they
did
not
mean
to
interfere
with
these
statutes
that
prohibited
specific
conduct
between
negro
and
white.
but,
we
submit,
there
is
a
possibility
of
distinguishment.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
we
had
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
if
my
argument
of
the
legislative
history
is
rejected
and
you
decide
--
i
would,
first,
have
a
position
advocated
by
pace
v.
alabama,
and
i
would
feel
that
that
would
have
to
be
rejected
too.
and,
the
--
we
submit
that
the
naim
is
possible
support
because
there,
you
found
there
was
no
federal
question
after
the
state
found
the
party
were
so-related.
they
still
had
the
question
before
the
court
as
to
whether
the
state
could
prohibit
interracial
marriages,
and
you
found
there
was
no
federal
question,
so
we
submit
that
support.
and
these
cases
are
going
to
have
to
be
overruled.
so,
you're
going
to
have
to,
first,
reject
the
argument
as
to
the
legislative
history
and
reject
their
use
of
the
words
there
in
the
direct
argument
before
the
whole
group.
and
you're
going
to
have
to
clearly
reject
the
rationale
of
pace
and
you
may
have
to
reject
naim
and
you
will
have
to
set
aside
stevens
--
he'll
of
course
be
set
aside,
stevens
v.
u.s.
which
was
decided
in
1944.
all
the
precedent
today
from
the
federal
judiciary
supports
the
proposition
the
states
can
enact
these
statutes,
way
back
to
kenny
v.
--
ex
rel.
kenny,
tuddy
(ph),
and
v.
state
and
so
forth,
all
of
them.
there's
no
proposition
in
the
federal
courts
saying
the
states
cannot.
all
of
them
support
the
idea
that
they
can
enact
state
anti-miscegenation
laws
and
all
these
things
would
have
to
be
set
aside.
they
each
represent
some
judicial
barrier
and
these
barriers
would
have
to
be
stepped
over.
the
rationale
is
given,
contemporaneous
with
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
will
have
to
be
rejected
in
pace.
now,
they
submit
that
pace
is
so
old
that
it
no
longer
has
any
weight.
we
submit
that
the
closer
the
case
is
to
the
time
of
the
passing
the
amendment,
and
there's
been
no
change
in
the
particular
subject
matter
involved.
in
other
words,
it's
not
education.
it's
marriage.
there's
been
no
change
that
many
cases
close
to
the
passing
of
the
amendment
carry
a
great
weight,
a
great
weight.
perhaps
they
have
a
better
insight
than
any
case
after
that
can
ever
have
because
they
were
there
and
we
aren't.
now,
to
the
distinguishment
between
798.05
and
798.02
has
taken
the
proposition
that
there
is
an
invidious
discrimination
here
in
these
two
statutes,
between
798.05
and
798.02.
section
798.02
--
798.02
prohibits
--
prohibits
lascivious
cohabitation
in
general
and
provides
for
a
two-year
maximum
sentence,
and
it's
a
felony
and
it
would
be
applicable
to
white-white
and
black-black.
section
798.05
prohibits
cohabitation
between
negro
and
white
couples
and
provides
a
maximum
sentence
of
one
year.
so,
we
see
that
--
in
one,
we
have
a
sentence
of
two
years.in
one,
we
have
a
sentence
of
one
year.
now,
both
798.05
and
798.02
aim
at
the
same
thing
and
that
is
preventing
the
offspring
of
illegitimate
product,
all
illegitimate
offspring.
798.02
prevents
it,
as
held
by
the
courts,
by
prohibiting
punishment
--
by
punishing
acts
involving
living
together
and
having
intercourse.
section
798.05
apparently
punishes
just
living
together
in
the
very
same
room.
the
court
--
we
submit
that
there
is
--
as
set
out
by
williamson
versus
optical
company
where
they
said
that
this
discrimination
must
be
invidious.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination.
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination.
there
is
discrimination,
we
admit,
but
one
group
has
lesser
sins,
the
other
group
has
greater.
that's
one
element,
but
the
idea
is
to
prohibit
the
same
results
and
they
have
taken
a
mildly
different
approach
and
we
submit
the
difference
is
not
invidious,
especially
as
applicable
to
these
defendants
where
they
receive
a
very
light
jail
sentence
30
days,
i
believe,
and
a
$250-fine
with
$24-court
cost.
now,
the
next
is
a
question
of
ambiguity
and
i'll
touch
lightly
on
that.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
there
are
multiple
cases
interpreting
negro.
you
go
to
words
and
phrases,
you
will
see
many
cases
interpreting
that
term
and
saying
that
it
has
a
well-understood
meaning.
and,
we
submit
that,
where
florida
has
set
it
out
by
1.01
with
mathematical
definiteness
that
certainly
florida
should
be
not
--
it
should
not
be
found
to
be
at
fault
for
ambiguity
when
cases,
whether
it
set
out
no
definition,
have
been
found
does
not
have
the
constitutional
infirmity
of
ambiguity.
we
further
submit
that
they
abandoned
this
argument
in
florida
supreme
court.
we
gave
you
copy
of
their
brief
to
verify
it.
section
3.71
of
the
florida
supreme
court
rules
provide
--
specifically
provides
that
where
you
fail
to
argue
in
your
brief,
you
have
abandoned
the
assignment
of
error
and
that's
set
out
by
cases
cited
in
the
brief.
now
the
last
point
doing
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
is
put
in
for
one
main
purpose.
it's
to
show
the
court
the
effect
of
setting
aside
or
an
attack
of
long-established
things
we
possibly
have.
if
we
were
to
set
aside
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
would
do
away
with
a
multiplicity
of
cases
and
change
a
lot
of
rights
that
have
the
general
appearance
that
being
vested
at
this
time.
if
we
threw
away
with
this
florida
constitutional
provision,
we
likewise,
do
a
wide
variety
of
things.
this
does
not
just
reach
these
defendants,
it
reaches
other
people
who
have
taken
property
because
their
former
relationship
was
illegal.
people
who
are
now
think
they're
married
may
not
be
married.
and,
the
same
thing
that
applies
to
attack
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
okay,
very
simply,
your
honor.
let's
say
that
i
had
a
relationship
with
a
and
we
both
intend
to
get
married
and,
ordinarily,
the
common
law
relationship
would
have
arisen,
except
for
the
provision
of
miscegenation
statute
and
--
or
the
florida
constitutional
provision.
and
then,
i
go
to
b
and
i'm
advised
by
my
counsel
that,
“you
don't
have
to
worry
about
a.
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
a
divorce.
you
can
marry
b”.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i'm
no
longer
married
to
b.
i'm
married
to
a.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
the
person
is
not
your
wife
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
sir,
first
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
--
lesson,
it
could
be
put
that
way.
it
could
be
put
that
way.
it's
--
it'd
be
the
same
way
as
if
the
statute
required
you
to
go
before
a
minister
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
and
take
an
oath
to
be
married.
and,
before
that
statute
was
enacted,
you
weren't
required
to
go
before
a
minister
and
you
did
everything
up
to
that
point
and
you
didn't
do
it.
you
didn't
do
the
last
thing
required
by
the
statute,
and
the
court
would
now
say
that
this
says
that
--
requires
that
a
woman
who
ordinarily
would
be
my
wife
is
no
longer
my
wife.
it's
the
same
application.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
it
could
be
applied
in
numerous
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
now,
i
would
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
because
a
property
passing
had
been
set
up
under
the
present
laws
which
have
to
do
with
--
we
will
recognize
and
we
even
got
a
case
permitting
inheritance
from
a
marriage
outside,
but
as
the
passing
on
from
what
would
have
been
--
was
not
a
marriage
inside
is
held
to
be
invalid
and
it
will
change
what's
vested
and
what's
unvested.
i
don't
know
how
many
cases.
as
far
as
the
idea
of
com
--
contracting
a
later
marriage,
the
counsel
in
the
state
informed
their
clients
that
they
can't
contract
a
later
marriage
when
they
married
outside
the
state.
but
they
don't
inform
them
when
they
did
marry
inside
the
state.
so,
there's
no
--
there's
no
change
there.
now
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
well,
as
far
as
the
state
itself
is
concerned
--
i
mean,
like
with
the
fourteenth,
if
we
set
it
aside,
you
might
argue
“well,
it
won't
touch
anybody
involved
outside
the
country”,
and
that's
true.
and,
as
we
set
this
florida
miscegenation
statute,
it
won't
involve
acts
done
outside
the
state,
but
it
never
did.
and
in
interpreting
the
fourteenth,
you
never
applied
it
to
acts
outside
the
country.
and,
interpreting
our
constitutional
provision,
we
never
applied
it
to
acts
outside
the
state.
and
therefore,
as
far
as
setting
aside
the
fourteenth,
it
won't
affect
far
--
decisions
outside
the
country.
and
we're
setting
aside
this
one
--
affect
far-reaching
decisions
outside
the
state,
but
the
things
is
we've
always
been
consistent
there
and
the
things
that
have
been
vested
have
been
vested
in
light
of
that
--
had
been
vested
in
light
of
that
with
the
knowledge
that
if
it
was
done
outside
the
state,
it
was
okay
and
if
it
was
done
inside
the
state,
it
was
not
okay.
now,
i
would
like
to
submit
one
thing
to
the
court
that
i
would
--
i
would
not
think
it
untoward
to
comment
on
it
in
the
opinion,
and
that
is
that
after
the
civil
war,
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
adopted
by
all
the
states,
whether
they
were
southern
or
northern,
and
the
states
were
considered
in.
and
then,
for
purposes
of
proposing
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
states
were
denied
their
state
senate
seats
--
or
their
federal
senate
seats,
and
their
federal
legislation.
and,
i
think
something
should
be
put
forth
which
will
prevent
a
precedent
that
10
years
from
now,
if
the
body
across
the
street
gets
angry
or
so
forth
and
so
on,
that
51%
of
the
members
over
there
cannot
count
the
49%,
that
is
the
minority,
and
then
propose
a
constitutional
amendment
by
two-thirds
vote,
the
contents
of
which
could
be
so
favorable
to
the
state
such
as
to
take
away
all
power
from
the
federal
courts
and
put
them
in
the
state
courts.
the
contents
of
which
would
be
so
favorable
--
it
could
be
so
favorable
to
the
states
whether
it'd
be
school,
prayer,
or
what
have
you
that
they
would
quickly
ratify
and
the
only
protection
against
such
an
unwarranted
act
is
the
requirement
of
two-thirds
over
here
and
that
51%
cannot
put
out
the
other
49%.
and
that's
what
was
done
in
passing
the
fourteenth.
the
greater
percent
put
out
lesser
percent
and
it
was
then
proposed
by
the
minority
--
the
group
left
and
we
should
have
some
way
of
distinguishing
that
act
from
a
later
precedent,
the
same
thing
can
be
done
again.
now
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
it
is
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
your
honor,
i
have
no
other
information
other
than
that
in
the
record
itself.
i
was
not
down
there
and
did
not
investigate
on
that.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
well,
i
found
that
if
i
go
outside
the
record,
i
have
the
tendency
to
intermingle
my
knowledge
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
--
(voice
overlap)
and
i
couldn't
tell
the
court
things
that
i
think
are
in
the
record
and
on
--
i
just
try
not
to
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
it
indicated
that
he
had
come
from
an
island
and
i
associate
geographically
and
it
was
all
in
florida
or
somewhere,
but
i
don't
remember
where.
but
that,
of
course,
would
not
change
being
negro.
now,
and
last,
i'd
like
to
read
one
thing
from
justice
harlan's
opinion,
the
elder,
one
thing,
bring
up
one
last
point
in
deciding
the
case
of
jacobson
v.
massachusetts
dealing
with
vaccination.
and
at
that
time,
vaccination
was
thought
by
a
large
people
--
a
group
of
people
to
be
important
to
their
general
concepts.
and
he
said,
in
considering
the
validity
of
the
vaccination
statute,
it
was
not
compelled
--
the
legislature
was
not
compelled
to
be
the
matter
involving
the
public
health
and
safety
in
the
final
decision
of
the
court
or
jury.
it
is
no
part
of
the
function
of
a
court
or
jury
to
determine
which
one
of
two
modes
would
likely
to
be
the
most
effective
for
the
protection
of
the
public
against
disease.
that
was
for
the
legislative
department
to
determine
in
light
of
all
information
it
could
obtain.
here,
there
has
been
no
evidence
given
in
the
courts
below
attacking
these
statutes
as
beyond
a
legislative
purpose,
in
particular,
the
miscegenation
provision.
there
was
no
evidence
presented
to
show
that
there
was
no
legislative
purpose
here.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
one
clear
legislative
purpose
that
must
be
recognized
and
we
may
disagree
with
it
but
it
must
be
recognized,
and
that
is
this.
in
brown
--
in
brown
versus
board
of
education,
you
recognize
that
the
psychological
impact
on
people
was
of
such
significance
that
you
would
guide
--
you
guided
the
law
accordingly.
and,
what
is
the
psychological
impact
in
an
interracial
marriage?
it's
not
to
do
with
either
parent.
it's
not
to
do
with
superiority-inferiority.
the
same
argument
would
be
made
whether
the
court
before
me
went
from
black
on
robes
to
whiter
skin
or
white
on
robes
to
blacker
skin.
the
thing
is
to
do
with
the
children.
youth
individually,
and
i
--
and
we
all
know,
that
we
like
--
it's
not
a
manner
of
like
or
dislike
but
we
have
a
close
affinity
for
the
child
or
the
grandchild
that
most
looks
like
ourselves.
we
see
our
immortality
spread
in
that
group.
now,
this
isn't
to
deal
with
our
right
but
it's
to
deal
with
a
psychological
grasp
of
the
child
by
the
grandparent
or
by
other
members
of
the
family.
the
fact
that
he's
identified
through
their
concept
of
themselves,
they
associate
with
him
and
identify
strongly
with
him
and
he
has
a
strong
psychological
envelop
that
we
know
of
--
that's
so
inherent
in
most
families.
and,
where
there
are
greatly
distinguished
physical
features,
this
psychological
grasping
does
not
occur.
and
the
state,
as
a
legal
--
as
a
legal
parent,
has
a
right
to
protect
children
from
what
may
be
a
psychological
effect.
now,
we
may
say
that
it
is
not,
but
i
think
there's
ample
information
to
support
the
possibility
that
there
is,
and
we
aren't
to
conclude
here
with
no
evidence
from
below
that
we
are
right
and
they
were
wrong.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
because
ordinarily,
one
and
one
make
two.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
ordinarily,
one
and
one
make
two.
and
in
the
school
case,
it's
one
and
one
make
two.
and
in
the
golf
case,
it's
one
and
one
make
two.
and
in
the
boxing
case,
it's
one
and
one
make
two.
but,
in
interracial
marriage,
one
and
one
do
not
make
two.
it
makes
three
or
four
or
five.
and
this
is
three,
four,
or
five
--
that's
not
applicable
to
the
other
cases
that's
directly
involved
here
and
that's
where
we're
resting
it
and
that's
why
it's
distinguishable.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
don't
understand
the
question.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
the
florida
legislature
evidently
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
--
i
would
imagine
you
could.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
your
honor,
i
agree
that
there
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
i
don't
think
they're
that
--
i
don't
think
there
are
that
many
recognized
races,
your
honor.
i
--
but
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
within
the
well-recognized
areas
of
races,
i
think
they
might
and
would
be
--
that
would
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
that
would
probably
be
three
like
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
well,
they
have
been
--
in
regards
to
the
indians,
many
times.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
yes,
sir,
i
believe
they
could.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
now,
i
understand
this.
it
could
well
be
argued
that
they
should
advocate
interracial
marriage.
there
may
be
something
supporting
that,
but
we
don't
determine
here
‘what
is
the
wisest
thing',
the
idea
is
if
there's
something
a
fairer
reason
to
infer
the
possibility
of
fact
existing
to
sustain
this
legislation,
then
such
facts
must
be
presumed
until
the
record
reflects
that
they
are
not
there,
and
this
record
does
not
so
reflect.
now,
you've
held
that
in
several
cases,
the
idea
that
--
well,
one
was
borden
products
company
--
borden's
products
incorporated
versus
borden.
but,
the
idea
is
that
until
the
facts
that
could
be
there,
show
not
to
be
there
by
the
record,
then
the
legislation
should
be
sustained.
i'm
not
arguing
that
later,
in
the
next
case,
that
they
not
--
may
not
put
on
ample
evidence
to
show
that,
psychologically,
the
grasping
out
to
the
grandchild
doesn't
apply
whatsoever
that
you
love
a
colored
child
just
as
much,
that
you
identify
with
just
as
much,
and
that
the
colored
grandparent
loves
the
white
child
just
as
much
and
identifies
with
them
just
as
much.
they
might
well
show
that
later
but,
if
they
don't
show
that
or
if
there's
a
reasonable
assumption
from
the
total
evidence
that
it's
to
the
contrary,
then
there's
a
clear
legislative
purpose
in
the
state
as
a
legal
greater
parent
and
--
heaven
knows
under
our
law
it
is,
they
can
take
from
the
natural
parent
very
quickly,
the
legal
greater
parent
from
--
to
protect
these
offspring
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
inferiority.
now
one
thing,
believe
me,
i
would
make
the
same
argument
no
matter
what
--
who
i
was
before.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
stay
half
a
minute,
your
honor.
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
that
--
mr.
james
g.
mahorner
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
the
way
of
philosophy
that
there
has
been
a
change
today
in
the
world,
and
that
change
is
in
physical
sciences
and
there's
been
a
vast
improvement
in
their
knowledge.
and,
today,
we
have
great
potential
one
to
destroy
the
other.
and
eventually,
it
won't
be
limited
to
country.it
will
be
possessed
by
the
forbes
and
the
rockefellers
and
people
who
would
generally
have
intelligence,
enough
intelligence
to
understand
well
--
understand
social
concepts
as
well
as
financial.
and
today,
we
have
several
times
than
on
the
brink
and
the
reason
we've
been
on
the
brink
is
not
because
of
the
advancement
of
physical
sciences.
it's
because
the
unbalanced
cause
by
the
lag
of
the
social
sciences
and
the
duty
of
the
social
sciences
is
to
give
us
such
strong
scientific
rules
of
law
or
rules
of
personal
relations
that
we
can
live
together
even
though
there's
been
such
an
upswing
in
the
physical
science
area.
and
we
think
that
this
decision
should
come
from
a
straight
logical
concept
and
we
will
readily
concede
that
there's
much
logic
against
us,
much.
i
do
not
think
the
strongest
point
against
us
is
necessarily
the
idea
of
a
mother
being
prohibited
from
living
with
its
child
since
we
recognized
the
marriage,
i
think
that
could
be
well
a
defense.
but
there
are
strong
points
against
us.
but,
if
the
logic
is
in
our
favor
regardless
of
the
social
desirability,
we
must
have
the
opinion.
we
have
--
we
feel
that
there
is
a
duty
to
offset
any
lag
if
we
are
to
continue
into
existence,
and
there
must
be
opinion
after
opinion
from
the
bar,
the
judiciary,
and
who
have
you
setting
up
a
strong
social
concept
as
equally
scientific
to
that
we
see
physically.
thank
you.
