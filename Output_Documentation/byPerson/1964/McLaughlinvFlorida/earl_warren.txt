dewey
mclaughlin

versus

mr.
coleman,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pollak.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pollak,
weren't
both
of
these
people
married
to
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
evidence
to
the
contrary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
wasn't
her
testimony.
that
was
an
ex
parte
statement,
wasn't
it?
out
of
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mahorner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
put
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
hypothetical
to
you,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
state
of
florida
had
a
law
which
prohibited
whites
from
visiting
the
homes
of
negroes
for
the
purpose
of
having
meals
together
and
vice
versa,
prohibited
negroes
from
visiting
white
homes
for
the
purpose
of
having
meals
together,
would
there
be
any
legal
distinction
between
that
kind
of
a
statute
and
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
tell
me
what
the
difference
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
i
--
maybe
i
can
add
another
element
to
it
then,
suppose
that
it
made
both
negroes
and
whites
violative
of
the
law
wherever
they
assembled
in
the
home
of
each
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
purpose
of
dinning
together.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
does
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
have
they
said
that?
they
haven't
said
that,
in
this
case,
that
no
one
can
do
that.
this
is
just
the
point
of
the
case,
it
seems
to
me,
they
said,
“no
negro
and
no
white
can
--
can
engage
in
this
context”.
they
haven't
said
that
--
that
no
one
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
engage
in
that
context.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
do
--
they
do
the
same
with
jews
and
gentiles,
as
they've
done
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
pursue
that
just
one
--
one
question
further,
mr.
mahorner.
suppose
that
they
were
assembled
and
eating
under
the
statute
in
a
building
that
wasn't
owned
by
either
of
them,
either
the
negroes
or
the
whites
in
--
that
were
in
question
but
they
were
assembled
for
the
purpose
of
dinning
together,
would
you
--
would
your
property
argument
still
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no.
we
won't
take
--
we
won't
take
a
restaurant.
let's
say
they
were
in
a
neighbor's
house
and
there
were
both
whites
and
negroes
there,
and
they
were
prosecuted
under
the
--
under
the
statute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
neither
of
them
owned
--
neither
of
them
owned
or
had
any
interest
in
the
property
whatsoever.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
rights
aren't
--
aren't
involved
in
a
case
where
he
isn't
--
where
he
isn't
prosecuted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
necessarily
lead
you
to
the
point
where
you
must
say
that
the
state
could,
in
that
manner,
separate
all
races
from
--
from
each
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
you
do
the
same
with
the
mongolian
race?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
you
just
substitute
the
word
“mongolians”
for
negroes
in
this
statute,
then
sustain
it
on
the
same
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
what
they
evidently
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
you
if
you
couldn't
sustain
it
from
the
same
theory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
if
you
could
do
it
for
them,
couldn't
you
do
it
for
polynesians?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
go
right
down
--
go
right
down
the
line,
race
for
--
race
for
race?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
for
the
number
--
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
number
you
would
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all,
all
of
the
recognized
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
the
recognized
races
then,
you
submit,
could
be
separated
by
--
by
law
in
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say.
i
just
want
to
find
out
what
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
your
argument
takes
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
--
you
have
until
the
red
light
comes
on,
mr.
mahorner.
chief
justice
earl
warren

coleman.
