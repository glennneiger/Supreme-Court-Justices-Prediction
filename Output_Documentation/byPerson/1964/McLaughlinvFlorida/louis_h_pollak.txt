mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan,
what
mr.
coleman
was
trying
to
say
is
that
your
timing
was
exactly
perfect
because
it
is
exactly
to
this
that
i
wish
to
address
myself.
mr.
coleman
has
demonstrated,
i
think,
conclusively
that
this
case
can
be
disposed
of
if
the
court
so
chooses
wholly
on
the
invalidity
of
section
798.05
standing
alone,
as
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
yesterday
implied.
but,
we
--
we
propose
to
argue,
and
this
will
be
my
burden,
that
the
invalidity
of
that
statute
under
which
appellants
were
convicted
is
compounded
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
incorporates
the
florida
anti-miscegenation
statutes
prohibiting
marriage
between
residents
of
florida
of
the
different
races.
and,
i
say
the
invalidity
is
compounded,
the
invalidity
of
a
basic
statute
is
compounded
advisably
in
that
--
to
emphasize
our
feeling
that
however
unconstitutional
798.05
is,
standing
alone,
an
unequal
criminal
law
it
--
a
law
which
prohibits
on
racial
grounds,
prohibits
the
sacrament
of
marriage
to
persons
of
different
marital
--
races
is,
if
there
is
such
a
concept
in
our
law,
even
more
unconstitutional.
now,
i
think
--
perhaps
i
should
first
say
a
word
as
to
whether
the
issue
was
here
because
the
state
has
raised
some
question
as
to
whether
the
issue
is
here.
let
me
say
very
briefly
that,
with
respect
to
florida's
contention
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
not
on
the
state
of
showing
the
non-marriage
of
defendants
in
a
prosecution
under
798.05,
the
state's
contention
on
this,
first
of
all,
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
only
relevant
authority,
as
florida
practically
concedes
the
board
case
discussed
in
both
briefs.
but,
more
precisely
and
i
think
dispositively,
the
trial
court's
instructions
in
this
case
are
flat
at
page
--
the
record
at
page
93
indicates
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
of
demonstrating
that
ingredient
of
the
offense,
namely
that
the
defendants
are
not
married.
that's
one
of
the
three
ingredients
of
the
offense
that
the
state
must
prove
beyond
the
exclusion,
as
the
trial
judge
put
it,
of
every
reasonable
blood.
the
--
so
--
and,
the
construction
put
on
the
statute
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
case
which
is
before
this
court,
convictions
affirmed
by
the
state
supreme
court,
i
would
say
are
conclusive.
this
court's
language
in
the
case
referred
to
yesterday
by
mr.
coleman,
the
decision
in
terminiello,
337
u.s.
page
1
and
page
5,
that
language
is
absolutely
conclusive
on
this
question.
so,
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
state.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record,
i
think
it's
clear,
from
which
a
jury
could
have
concluded
that
there
was
a
common
law
marriage,
also
could
have
concluded
that
there
was
not
if
the
jury
had
been
permitted
to
reach
that
issue.
and,
i
would
particularly
refer
the
court
and
then
i
will
leave
the
factual
problems
to
the
testimony
at
the
top
of
page
30
of
the
record,
the
first
answer
in
which
the
landlady
of
appellant
refers
to
her
husband
and
her.
now
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
testimony
by
some
witnesses
that
one
or
--
that,
i
think
with
respect
to
each
the
defendants
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
they
had
made
some
such
statement.
now,
i
would
say
as
to
that,
but
it
would
be
within
the
jury's
province
to
believe
or
disbelieve
that
portion
of
the
narrator's
testimony.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
there
was
also
evidence
that
mrs.
mclaughlin
or
mrs.
hoffman,
as
she's
referred
to
in
the
record,
has
described
herself
as
married
to
mclaughlin,
mrs.
goodnick
so
said
on
page
22
of
the
record.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
but
--
but
that
was
true
of
all
the
testimony
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
testimony
with
respect
to
marriage
to
others
was
also
hearsay
or
ex
parte
testimony.
there
is
no
testimony
in
this
record
forthcoming
from
the
appellants
themselves
who
were
the
defendants
and
who
did
not
take
the
stand.
so
that,
all
the
testimony
is
of
the
same
hearsay
character
and
our
position
on
this
is
merely,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
a
jury
were
permitted
to
consider
the
testimony,
it
might
have
come
to
either
position.
when
mrs.
goodnick
says
on
page
30,
speaking
of
the
appellants,
“i
know
he
is
husband
and
wife
and
they
pay
me
the
rent.
i
didn't
bother
them”,
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
is
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
have
concluded
that
these
were
people
who
held
themselves
aught
to
be
--
and
were
thought
to
be
married
to
one
another.
but,
a
jury
could
have
certainly
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion,
i
wouldn't
begin
to
challenge
it.
now,
to
come
--
to
reach
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
granted
that
the
state
have
the
burden
of
proving
non-marriage
and
that
the
issue
is
here,
the
state's
suggestion
that
failure
to
object
to
the
challenge
keeps
it
out
of
this
record
is
in
view
of
the
terminiello
case.
and,
in
view
of
the
statutes
referred
to
the
florida
statutes,
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief,
and
i
refer
to
pages
13
through
17
of
our
reply
brief
on
the
question
of
the
state
practice,
i
think
that
issue
is
foreclosed.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
asks
whether
there
is
not
merit
in
the
contention
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
bill
of
1866
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
am,
and
i
apologize
for
rephrasing
your
question
that
way.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
properly
understood,
reflects
no
equation
between,
as
florida
has
suggested,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
no
identity,
that
is,
to
be
sure
it
was
a
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
put
the
1866
act
on
cons
--
on
a
constitutional
and
unrepealable
level.
but,
florida
suggests
that
it
was
to
do
no
more
than
that,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
limited
by
the
terms
and
immediate
explicit
purposes
of
the
1866
act.
i
suggest
that
the
--
we
have
an
exact
direct
test
of
whether
this
precise
equation
can
be
maintained.
if
we
look
to
find
whether
there
are
other
problems
excluded
from
the
ambit
of
the
1866
act
which
have
been
found
by
this
court
to
be
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
then,
i
submit,
the
asserted
equation
wholly
breaks
down.
to
make
this
test,
we
have
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
from
language
by
the
manager
of
the
bill
--
the
civil
rights
bill
showing
that
he
did
not
conceive
as
covering
questions
of
jury
service,
questions
of
suffrage,
or
questions
of
attendance
at
schools,
all
issues
are
much
mooted
in
the
debate,
with
respect
to
each
of
these,
it's
our
elementary
jurisprudence
that
this
court
has,
for
decades,
found
the
juries
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia,
suffrage
in
nixon
versus
hern
and
in
nixon
versus
condon,
schools
surely
before
brown
versus
board
of
education
at
least
back
to
missouri,
ex
rel.
gaines
against
canada,
but
all
of
these
issues
have
been
found
to
be
within
the
ambit
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
that,
unless
those
decisions,
all
of
them,
were
fundamentally
misdecided
by
this
court,
then
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
florida
breaks
down.
we
have
taken
the
liberty
of
putting
in
our
reply
brief
extensive
excerpts
from
mr.
bickel's
masterly
article
on
the
original
understanding
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
article
published
a
year
following
this
court's
decision
in
brown,
because
he
there
examines
with
a
particularity
that
i
know
of,
and
no
other
source,
the
assert
--
precisely
the
asserted
equation
which
florida
submits
and
he
--
he
takes
the
full
canvas
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
and
the
ultimate
amendment.
and
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
that
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
a
very
strong
case
can
be
made
for
that
proposition.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
cannot
offer
to
you
anything
in
the
sense
of
positive
legislative
history
that
would
support
the
notion
that
at
the
time
it
was
supposed
that
at
a
later
time,
this
issue
of
miscegenation
might
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
amendment.
at
the
same
time,
i
can't
offer
to
you
with
any
conviction
legislative
assurance
that
the
other
problems
which
have
been
judicially
determined
to
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
amendment
were
so
understood
at
the
time.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
characterization
in
the
brown
case
of
the
evidence
as
inconclusive
could
certainly
embrace
this
issue
as
well.
what
--
the
reason
that
i
--
that
we
--
that
we
offered
mr.
bickel's
conclusions
to
you
without
attempting
to
impose
on
you
all
the
substructure
of
history,
which
is
of
course
in
mr.
bickel's
article,
is
that
the
conclusions
that
he
reaches
are
in
essence,
that
the
--
that
the
coalition
of
radicals
and
conservative
republicans
who
were
the
majority,
who
were
responsible
for
the
enactment
of
the
amendment,
proposal
of
it
in
the
congress,
were
essentially
reaching
a
compromise
under
which,
as
mr.
bickel
puts
it,
the
conservatives
could
go
before
the
country
saying,
“we
did
not
pass
an
amendment
which
affects
schools
or
voting
or
jury
service
or
anti-miscegenation
laws”.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
radicals
could
feel
that
they
had
an
amendment
which,
in
the
fullness
of
time
whether
through
legislative
or
through
judicial
elaboration,
would
be
found
to
have
a
more
spacious
--
a
more
spacious
context.
now,
that
--
i
offer
you
that
simply
as
the
conclusion
of
i
think
the
best
student
of
that
legislative
history
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
is
unquestionably
true,
mr.
justice,
and
i
think
we
are
--
we
are
in
a
situation,
and
i
mean
not
just
this
court
but
the
country,
in
interpreting
--
in
the
middle
of
the
20th
century
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
we
have
to
make
ultimately
this
most
sensitive
kind
of
historic
judgment
that
can't
be
demonstrated
one
way
or
another
on
the
basis
of
an
isolated
statement
by
congressman
bingham
and
congressman
--
congressman
wilson,
or
whatever.
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
feel
--
i
wouldn't
feel
it
appropriate
to
ask
to
find
a
sentence
in
isolation
saying,
“yes,
we'll
get
rid
of
anti-miscegenation
laws
this
way
of
controlling
it
in
this
kind
of
constitutional
interpretation”.
i
only
submit,
with
respect
to
this
entire
issue,
that
to
try
to
find
a
--
to
insist
upon
a
statement
in
1866
that
the
impact
of
the
amendment
would
be
to
erase
such
statutes,
would
be
to
erect
a
narrow
standard
--
a
too
narrow
standard
of
legislative
understanding
of
a
constitutional
amendment
as
opposed
to
a
statute
which
does
violence
to
the
kind
of
constitutional
interpretation
signaled
of
course
by
the
brown
case
and
by
the
other
fundamental
cases
construing
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
think
the
state
of
florida
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
wouldn't
disagree
with
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
what
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
is
that
i
think
that
the
whole
genius
of
its
adjudications
has
been
that
--
it
has
known
that
it
is
a
constitution
which
it
--
which
you,
sirs,
and
your
predecessors
have
been
expounding
and
the
intentions
which
go
into
the
passage
of
a
constitutional
amendment
are
more
spacious
intentions
normally
than
those
that
go
into
the
statute.
and
with
respect
exactly
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
--
we
have
an
elaborate
history
demonstrative
of
just
this
--
just
this
--
the
spaciousness
and
that's
why,
without
attempting
to
impose
particularities
of
debate
on
you
at
this
time,
i
have
urged
mr.
bickel's
analysis
of
that
history.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
am
--
i
am
urging
exactly
that
approach
of
course,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
i
didn't
mean
to
think
--
to
allow
you
to
think
that,
in
urging
that
approach,
i
understood
this
court
as
--
as
rejecting
or
thinking
irrelevant
what
essentially
was
the
real
original
understanding
and
the
spaciousness
of
that
understanding
at
the
time.
the
--
in
the
two
minutes
remaining
to
me,
because
we
wish
to
save
some
time
for
mr.
coleman's
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
urge
on
this
court
that
the
--
of
course
florida
has,
as
every
state
has,
a
paramount
interest
in
the
matrimonial
institution.
the
question
is
whether
the
regulations
it
makes
are
rational
regulations,
such
as
those
that
deal
with
consanguinity.
regulations
that
have
a
racial
dimension
are
inherently,
intrinsically
suspects
in
terms
of
our
fundamental
institutions.
the
notion
that
the
federal
constitution
controls
even
the
state's
paramount
interest
in
matrimony,
as
i
think
evident
from
the
fact
that
--
at
each
term
of
court,
this
court
in
the
name
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
will
--
will
intervene
with
respect
to
one
or
another
act
of
state
authority
in
the
area
of
marriage.
the
--
and,
i
take
it
that
one
would
not
urge
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
was
a
weightier
provision
of
the
constitution
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
take
it
--
that
to
be
true
except
that
the
state
of
florida,
to
my
astonishment,
urges
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
a
part
of
the
constitution.
it
remakes
an
argument
flatly
rejected
by
this
court
with
respect
to
the
submission
of
the
amendment.
i
would
say,
only
to
that,
that
apart
from
the
rather
radical
consequences
of
reading
the
fourteenth
amendment
out
of
constitution,
florida's
argument
would
also
require
this
court
to
read
amendments
one
through
ten
out
of
the
constitution.
and,
those
amendments,
if
you
examine
the
journals
of
the
senate
and
the
house,
were
also
submitted
by
congress
by
two-thirds
of
the
senators
and
congressmen
present
under
the
guidance
of
mr.
madison,
not
by
two-thirds
of
the
--
of
the
full
membership
of
either
chamber.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
they
seem
to
me
on
a
parity,
except
to
this
extent,
mr.
justice
harlan.
as
i
think
mr.
coleman
put
it,
the
anti-miscegenation
statute
is
even
less
defensible
than
a
state
statute
requiring
segregation
of
the
schools,
in
the
sense
that
it
imposes
--
it
--
state
power
is
imposed
on
two
persons,
both
of
whom
desire
to
be
married,
desire
--
of
all
of
personal
and
present
rights
enshrined
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it's
surely
the
most
personal
and
present
right.
this
court
has
held
since
meyer
versus
nebraska,
in
261
u.s.,
that
marriage
--
the
right
to
marry
and
to
bring
up
children
is
within
the
amendment's
ambit.
and,
in
this
most
personal
and
intimate
of
relationships,
the
state
is
--
in
bringing
--
insisting
on
division.
in
the
school
cases,
rightly
as
obviously
i
think
they
were
decided,
the
states
could
at
least
urge
that
there
was
a
countervailing
interest
of
persons
who
did
not
want
themselves
or
their
children
to
be
integrated
in
schools.
one
of
this
court's
--
the
most
rigorous
critique
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
brown
case,
with
whom
i
--
i'm
in
97%
disagreement,
professor
wechsler
distinguishes
the
school
situation
from
the
miscegenation
situation
in
just
those
terms.
he
finds
the
case
for
the
--
unconstitutionality
of
the
miscegenation
statute
much
more
persuasive
because,
there,
he
says,
by
hypothesis,
both
parties
want
the
association
that
the
state
is
barring.
i
said
i
was
in
97%
difference
with
mr.
wechsler
only
because
the
3%,
i
would
agree
with
is
precisely
that
the
anti-miscegenation
case,
the
case
now
before
this
court,
is
an
easier
case
than
the
brown
case.
obviously,
i
think
the
brown
case
was
rightly
decided
and
i
think
that
a
decision
today
by
--
by
this
court
striking
down,
uprooting
--
uprooting,
root
and
branch,
the
fabric
of
the
miscegenation
laws
which
cover
some-19
states
still
though,
the
tendency
has
been
to
repeal,
such
a
decision
will,
in
the
fullness
of
time,
accomplish
what
surely
was
a
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
write
the
dred
scott
decision
out
of
our
laws.
there,
this
court
said,
“speaking
of
the
anti-miscegenation
laws,
this
stigma
of
the
deepest
degradation
was
fixed
upon
the
whole
race”.
i
submit
to
this
court,
the
time
has
come
to
remove
this
stigma
from
the
fabric
of
american
law.
