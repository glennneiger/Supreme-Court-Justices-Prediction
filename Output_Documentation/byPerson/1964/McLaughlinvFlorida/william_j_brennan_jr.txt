justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
other
words,
one
of
the
ingredients
is
the
state's
burden
of
proof
that
there
was
no
marriage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
coleman
may
i
ask,
if
we
should
agree
with
your
proposition
that
on
its
face,
because
it
applies
only
to
a
man
and
woman
of
different
races,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
we
won't
have
to
be
concerned
with
any
of
this
you're
arguing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
mean
would
this
be
a
thompson
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
this
be
thompson
form
of
element?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
one
last
question,
if
i
may,
mr.
coleman.
the
--
that
the
state
did
not
proved
the
element
of
the
offense,
you
argued
that
--
as
mr.
justice
clark
suggested,
that
also
it
has
a
problem
with
the
definition
of
negro
and
color.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
--
do
i
correctly
understand
that
argument
that
this
is
really
a
buoy
kind
of
vagueness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
statute,
on
that
ground
alone,
is
vague
in
that
sense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
unconstitutionally
applied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
if
that
argument
persuades
us
then,
i
guess,
we'll
reach
none
of
these
other
questions
in
solving
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
