mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
appeal
is
whether
in
a
country
committed
the
equality
concept
as
it
--
as
inviting
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
a
state,
one,
can
make
certain
conduct
illegal
and
criminal
exclusively
and
solely
because
persons
of
different
races
are
involved,
or
two,
can
deny
citizens
the
right
to
marry
each
other
exclusively
and
solely
because
they
are
of
different
races.
the
case
is
here
on
appeal
at
every
stage
in
the
proceeding,
the
appellants'
attack
the
constitutionality
on
federal
grounds
of
the
statute
of
which
they
stand
convicted.
the
relevant
facts
are
as
follows.
on
march
1,
1962,
appellants
described
in
the
information
which
appears
on
page
3
of
the
record
as
connie
hoffman
and
dewey
mclaughlin
were
charged
with
violation
of
section
798.05
of
the
florida
statutes.
this
statute,
which
is
found
on
page
2
of
our
brief
provides
any
negro
man
and
white
woman
or
any
white
man
and
negro
woman
who
are
not
married
to
each
other
who
shall
habitually
live
in
and
occupy
in
the
night
time
the
same
room
shall
be
punished
by
imprisonment
not
exceeding
12
months
or
by
fine
not
ex
--
not
exceeding
$500.
the
information
alleged
that
the
person
described
in
the
information
as
connie
hoffman
being
a
white
woman,
and
dewey
mclaughlin
being
a
negro
man
who
are
not
married
to
each
other
that
habitually
live
in
and
occupy
in
the
night
time
the
same
room.
the
appellants
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty.
they
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
information
which
motion
appears
on
page
5
of
the
record,
and
in
this
motion,
they
attack
the
constitutionality
of
798.05
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
federal
constitution
because
of
vagueness
that
it
denied
them
equal
protection
of
law
and
invaded
their
right
to
privacy.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
sir
i
make
the
--
sir,
i
make
the
firm
statement
that
in
first
place,
the
statute
is
not
a
cohabitation
statute,
if
you
mean
by
cohabitation
that
there
has
to
be
sexual
intercourse.
i
make
the
firm
statement
that
--
that
there
is
no
statute
in
florida
which
would
punish
this
conduct
if
done
by
two
white
persons
with
different
sexes
or
two
negroes.
and
i
thought
that
we
would
spend
some
time
in
the
brief
pointing
out
the
florida
statutes,
but
sir,
i
think
i'm
relieved
to
that
obligation
because
if
you
will
turn
to
page
55
of
the
state's
brief
which
is
a
brief
for
the
appellee,
you
will
see
where
they
say
and
they
recognize
that
the
statute
that
we're
under,
798.05,
does
not
require
proof
that
sexual
intercourse
took
place.
and
the
only
statute
that
the
state
can
come
near
to
pointing
out
that
maybe
there
is
a
similar
crime
of
people
who
are
involved
of
the
same
race
is
798.02
where
they
admit
and
concede
that
under
that
statute,
the
state
must
show
and
has
to
show
as
a
matter
of
its
proof
that
sexual
intercourse
took
place.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
sir,
this
is
called
the
lewd
and
cohabitation
statute.
under
the
fornication
statute,
i
think
every
state
that
has
one
in
the
union
clearly
requires
proof
of
sexual
intercourse.
this
statute
--
and
let's
make
this
clear
only
for
the
argument
that
this
statute
does
not
require
any
proof
of
sexual
intercourse
and
that
issue
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury.
in
fact,
i
think
at
this
stage
just
to
wrap
this
point
up
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
charge
which
appears
on
page
--
starting
on
page
92
of
the
record.
and
at
page
93
at
the
bottom
of
the
last
four
paragraph
where
the
judge
says
“i
instruct
you
that
the
elements
of
the
crime
--
charge
in
this
case
and
which
must
be
proved
to
you
beyond
--
and
beyond
the
exclusion
of
every
reasonable
blood”
and
i'm
pretty
sure
he
means
doubt
“are
as
follows.
that
one
defendant
in
this
case
has
at
least
1/8
negro
blood
and
that
the
other
defendant
has
more
than
7/8
white
blood.
two
that
defendants
have
habitually
or
did
habitually
live
in
and
occupied
the
same
room
during
the
night
time
and
three,
that
defendants
were
not
married
to
each
other
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
offense.”
you
will
note
there's
no
charge
that
you
have
to
prove
that
sexual
intercourse
took
play
and
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief
on
page
10
and
12
which
clearly
establish
that
fact.
so
here,
you
have
a
case
where
solely
because
the
parties
are
of
different
race,
they
can
go
to
jail
and
be
sentenced
with
the
same
thing
that
if
they
had
been
of
the
same
race,
they
could
not
have
been
punished
for.
as
i
pointed
out
to
sir,
not
only
did
we
attack
the
statute
by
filing
a
motion
attacking
the
information,
but
immediately
after
the
case
had
been
called
for
trial
but
before
any
witnesses
were
put
on,
the
same
constitutional
issues
were
raised
and
the
court
there
rejected
them
on
the
ground
that
have
been
raised
and
passed
upon
by
another
judge.
that
appears
on
page
18
of
the
record.
now,
as
i've
told
you,
there
were
three
things
that
the
state
had
to
prove.
now
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
first
one,
namely
that
they
lived
in
the
same
room
together
or
they
occupy
the
same
room
was
testimony
that
on
several
occasion,
dewey
mclaughlin
was
seen
in
the
apartment
rented
to
the
woman,
appellant,
and
that
he
was
seen
there
as
late
as
11
o'clock
at
night
and
as
early
as
7:30
in
the
morning.
now
that's
basically
the
testimony
on
that
and
we
don't
challenge
that
fact.
now
with
respect
to
the
marriage
or
lack
of
marriage,
and
when
i
developed
my
argument,
you
will
find
that
the
state
has
determined
that
the
existence
of
a
marriage
is
part
of
the
offense
and
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
a
marriage
did
not
exist.
now
the
testimony
on
marriage
is
in
conflict
and
it
was
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir,
there's
a
case
which
so
holds
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
was
no
marriage,
and
we
cite
that
case
in
our
brief
your
honor.
now
the
testimony
in
all
of
this
came
out
of
the
witnesses
produced
by
the
state,
was
that
the
two
appellants
had
held
themselves
out
as
being
husband
and
wife
and
they
referred
to
on
many
occasions
as
husband
and
wife.
the
state,
however,
sought
to
prove
that
a
marriage
did
not
exist,
relying
upon
testimony
that
when
the
male
appellant
applied
in
1961
which
was
two
years
--
which
was
a
year
before
the
offense,
had
stated
when
asked
his
marital
status
that
he
was
separated
from
a
person
named
willy
mclaughlin.
and
also
with
respect
to
the
woman
appellant,
the
state
attempted
to
show
that
at
different
times
in
her
life,
as
one
time
she
went
by
the
name
of
gonzales
and
then
she
went
by
the
name
of
hoffman.
now
with
respect
to
the
marriage
or
non-marriage,
our
position
on
that
is
that
perhaps
a
jury
could've
found
either
way
that
there
was
a
marriage
or
there
was
not
a
marriage
although
i
don't
think
the
testimony
is
really
that
clear
but
we
don't
have
that
problem
because
the
judge,
when
he
turned
to
that
issue,
took
that
issue
out
of
the
case
because
he
instructed
on
page
94
that
in
the
state
of
florida
that
if
the
facts
took
place
in
florida,
which
you
may
rely
upon
to
prove
a
common
law
marriage,
that
if
the
parties
were
of
different
races,
they
couldn't
enter
into
a
common
law
marriage.
there's
a
florida
constitution
provision
which
prevents
that
and
there
are
two
florida
statutes
and
i
think
there's
a
third
one
that
will
put
the
minister
in
jail
that
would
perform
that
type
of
ceremony.
so
therefore
the
issue
was
taken
away
from
the
jury.
now
the
constitution
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
was
taken
away
from
the
jury.
the
jury
said
“if
you
find
that
one
is
a
negro
and
the
other's
white
and
--
and
if
you
find
that
whatever
relation
there
depending
upon
took
place
in
florida,
and
i
instruct
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they
could
not
be
married
because
in
--
in
florida,
there
is
a
statute
which
prevents
the
intermarriage
of
negro
male,
white
person
and
white
--
and
white
people.”
therefore
that
issue
was
taken
out.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
defendant
did
not
put
on
defense
your
honor
because
they
felt
that
after
the
case
was
tried
relying
upon
the
judgment
that
lawyers
do
sometime
within
the
pit
or
they
just
feel
that
the
state
hasn't
proven
its
case
and
in
fact
that
proved
the
case
to
the
extent
that
the
appellants
would
like
it
proved,
so
why
do
you
cut
it
up
by
putting
on
the
defense.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
sir,
that
was
not
objected
to
but
there's
an
opinion
by
justice
douglas
which
is
in
337
u.s.
1,
i
know
the
citation.
i'll
try
to
pronounce
the
name,
i
think
terminiello
versus
chicago,
and
justice
douglas
before
the
court
held
that
where
the
instruction
of
the
judge
in
effect
constitutes
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
the
appellant
challenges
the
statute
as
applied,
then
there
is
no
need
to
take
a
special
exception
for
the
instruction.
and
so
for
that
basis,
and
also
because
flor
--
florida
like
many
other
states
say
that
where
it's
fundamental
that
you
do
not
have
to
object,
and
indeed
there's
a
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
--
in
our
reply
brief
at
the
henderson
case,
which
says
in
whole
specifically
that
where
the
charge
in
effect
goes
to
the
gist
of
the
statutory
crime
and
by
making
the
charge
you
take
out
part
of
the
--
the
--
the
statutory
offense
that
you
don't
have
to
object
and
you
can't
raise
that
on
appeal.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
now
with
respect
to
the
miscegenation
or
anti-miscegenation
issue
mr.
pollak
was
going
to
develop
that
part
of
the
argument
and
i
was
going
to
develop
just
the
question
you
raised
justice
--
mr.
justice
brennan
that
on
the
face,
the
statute
under
which
these
people
were
convicted
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
on
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
the
next
par
--
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
what
the
judge
said
the
law
of
florida
was
and
i
think
that
you
fairly
could
read
the
statute
because
it
says
if
you're
a
residence
or
domicile
in
florida
then
you
can't
get
married.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
no
sir,
because
the
evidence
here
was
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
to
the
extent
that
this
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
common
law
of
marriage
your
honor,
it's
clear
that
it
took
place
in
florida.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
if
at
all.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
and
so
he
took
it
out
of
the
case,
because
that's
the
facts
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
as
i
said
mr.
pollak
will
develop
that
part
of
the
argument.
i
would
like
to
turn
back
to
the
constitutionality
or
one
--
one
other
point
and
i
think
we
would
be
able
to
break.
with
respect
to
the
race
of
the
party,
i
think
that,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
read
pages
60,
65
of
the
record.
that
there
you
have
a
florida
statute
which
says
--
has
this
provision
of
1/8
which
because
you
use
mathematics,
you
just
assume
that
it
must
be
definite.
but
then
just
read
what
the
judge
said
because
once
you
had
the
1/8
problem
of
the
blood
and
the
lawyer
pointed
out
where
you
can't
prove
who
has
negro
blood
and
who
doesn't
have
negro
blood,
the
judge
is
“oh,
the
statute
can't
mean
that.”
and
then
he
moves
to
say
“well
it
must
mean
ancestors?”
then
they
said
“there's
no
proof
of
ancestors
in
the
record.”
he
says
“well
it
really
doesn't
mean
that.
what
it
really
must
mean
is
that
somebody
can
go
on
the
stand
and
testify
as
to
the
race
of
the
party
in
his
judgment
and
that's
all
the
state
has
to
do.”
now
the
person
to
testify
as
respect
to
the
race
says
“i'm
no
expert
in
this
but
in
my
judgment
one
looks
like
white
and
the
other
negro.”
so
i
do
think
you
also
have
the
issue
of
vagueness,
or
if
the
statute
isn't
vague,
you
have
the
issue
that
the
--
there's
no
proof.
there's
no
proof
in
this
record
that
one
person
had
1/8
negro
blood
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
there's
no
proof
in
this
record
that
one
party
has
1/8
negro
blood.
there's
no
place
in
the
record
that
the
other
party
has
7/8
white
blood.
well
the
only
proof
is
that
--
that
somebody
goes
on
the
stand
says
“i'm
not
an
expert
but
looking
at
them,
i
think
one's
white
and
one
is
negro.”
now
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir,
both
of
them
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
and
then
with
respect
to
the
marriage
statute,
i
know
not
--
no
relationship
and
more
personal
and
to
tell
you,
well
you
really
can't
complain
because
you
can
go
and
find
somebody
else
you
can
marry.
certainly,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
answer
the
problem
as
whether
the
statute
has
really
affected
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
mr.
justice
brennan
made
the
suggestion
by
one
of
his
questions
that
if
we
are
correct
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
or
lack
of
constitutionality
of
the
section
under
which
the
appellants
were
convicted,
because
that
statute
refers
to
race,
then
we
really
don’t
get
to
the
other
questions
we
raised,
namely
constitutionality
of
the
general
anti-miscegenation
statute.
so,
i'd
like
to
spend
my
few
remaining
moments
just
directing
my
attention
to
the
statute
under
which
the
parties
were
convicted.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
would
certainly
say
that
in
a
brief
where
we
attacked
the
anti-miscegenation
statute,
i
think
mclaughlin
versus
florida
would
play
a
prominent
part.
as
i
told
you,
we've
set
forth
the
statute
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
the
statute
refers
to
race
in
at
least
three
places.
in
addition,
the
charge
of
the
court
and
most
the
trial
made
it
quite
clear
that,
depending
upon
the
races
of
the
party,
there
would
either
be
a
conviction
or
not
a
conviction.
now,
we
think
that
there's
no
doubt
in
this
case
that
the
bite
of
the
statute,
the
guts
of
the
statute,
is
race.
and
therefore,
it's
directly
in
conflict
with
numerous
decisions
of
this
court,
all
of
which
have
been
unanimous
on
this
point
that
where
the
state
imposes
penalties
based
upon
the
race
of
a
party,
that
statute
clearly
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and,
indeed,
in
the
voting
case
written
by
mr.
justice
clark
just
last
term
that
even
though
the
appellants
were
not
able
to
show
that
it
made
a
difference,
nevertheless,
because
that
statute
referred
to
race
and
--
and
required
the
state
to
designate
the
race
of
the
party,
the
court
said
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
in
this
case,
we
not
only
have
what
we
had
in
anderson
but
we
do
have
the
fact
that
these
people
either
go
to
jail
or
they
remain
free
based
solely
upon
their
race.
and
we
think
that
certainly
the
dorsey
case
where
you
had
the
prohibition
against
interracial
boxing
and,
certainly,
the
state
could
outlaw
all
boxing
and
you
may
have
a
due
process
argument,
but
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
but,
because
they
said
that
negroes
and
whites
could
not
box,
the
court
struck
that
statute
down
because
once
again
it
refers
to
race
and,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
this
answers
your
question.
and,
there,
assuming
and
let's
go
back
to
when
we
both
remember
in
the
great
second
joe
louis-billy
con
fight,
that
if
the
statute
had
prohibited
that
fight,
mr.
con
would
have
lost
money
and
mr.
louis
would
have
lost
money.
and,
the
fact
that
one
was
white
and
one
was
negro
so
they
both
lost
money,
nevertheless,
would
not
mean
that
the
court
would
still
not
strike
the
statute
down.
so,
i
think
you
have
the
same
thing
here.
the
fact
that
one
appellant
is
said
to
be
white,
the
other
is
said
to
be
negro,
and
they
both
go
to
jail
doesn't
in
any
way
change
the
rule
of
this
court
that,
where
the
statute
refers
to
race,
it's
clearly
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
but,
sir,
with
respect
to
that,
our
position
is
that
you
really
don't
have
to
overrule
pace,
although
we
think
it
should
be
overruled,
because,
as
we
understand
pace,
there,
you
had
a
fornication
statute.
and,
the
general
statute
made
everyone
guilty
if
he
and
she
engaged
in
fornication
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
yes,
but
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
well,
we
think
it's
clear
and
the
one
thing
that
this
court's
decision,
since
1954
and
indeed
we
think
1937,
made
it
clear
that
where
the
state
inserts
race
in
the
statute
and
--
and
the
offense
or
lack
of
offense
depends
upon
the
race
of
the
party,
that
clearly
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and,
we
think
that
that
is
a
question
that
is
just
--
ought
to
be
beyond
argument
at
this
day
in
the
court.
but
getting
back,
mr.
justice
stewart,
to
the
product
--
i
mean,
to
the
pace
case,
as
we
understand
it,
there,
what
the
state
did
was
to
make
a
different
penalty
if
the
parties
were
of
a
different
race.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
and
we
--
what
we
think
that
(voice
overlap)
----
the
punishment.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
well,
we
think
that's
true
in
the
school
cases.
that's
true
in
the
bus
case.
certainly,
i
would
much
rather
argue
that
you're
really
not
giving
--
that
you're
imposing
upon
me
indiscriminant
equality
if
you
say
i
cannot
marry
a
particular
person
than
if
you
say
that
i
can't
go
to
psat
but
i
can
go
in
ps20.
i
think
that
it's
easy
--
my
case
is
easier
than
the
school
cases
because
i
think
that
it's
just
hard
for
me
to
imagine
someone
saying
that
i'm
getting
equality
because
i
can
marry
someone
else
but
i
can't
marry
the
person
i
really
want
to
marry
because
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
am.
and,
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
it
clear
that,
i
think
this
wonderful
phrase
which
appears
in
justice
--
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
also
in
one
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
of
this
superficial
equality,
and
i
think
that's
basically
what
you
have
and
this
court
has
rejected
it
and
i
think
they
ought
to
reject
it
in
this
case.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
would
think
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
right.
i
want
to
make
it
clear.
i
think
that
one
of
the
great
things
that
the
--
that
not
only
the
constitution
but
also
ever
federal
statute
that
i
have
been
able
to
read
never
refers
to
negro
or
to
white.
it
just
says
you
can't
do
something
because
of
race,
and
that's
basically
what
i
think
we
hope,
in
the
20
--
the
second
half
of
the
20th
century,
this
court
is
finally
coming
around
to.
and,
i
think
that's
what
the
decisions
represent.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
am
not
abandoning
--
i
am
not
abandoning
that
argument.
i'm
not
abandoning
the
argument
that
the
statute
is
vague.
i'm
not
abandoning
the
--
mr.
pollak
will
argue
the
anti-miscegenation,
we're
not
abandoning
that,
but
we
do
think
that
it's
so
clear
on
so
many
different
grounds
that
this
conviction
must
be
versed
--
reversed.
that
the
one
i
am
pressing
now
is
the
one
suggested
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
namely
because
the
statute
refers
to
race,
the
bite
of
the
statute
is
race,
that
every
decision
of
this
court
is
necessarily
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
true,
sir,
but
i
do
think
that
the
easier
question
under
the
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
the
decision
of
this
court
is
that
because
the
statute
mentions
race
three
times.
the
judge
said
that
you
can't
convict
these
people
if
their
race
is
different
from
what
the
state
claims.
the
fact
that
the
information
says
that
and
that's
what
the
trial
is
all
about,
that
on
that
ground,
that
even
--
that's
the
easiest
ground,
based
upon
the
previous
decision
of
this
court
in
which
to
reverse
the
conviction.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
well,
i
think
that's
why,
basically,
i
think
the
--
this
wonderful
phrase
that
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
--
race
is
constitutionally
irrelevant.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
was
going
to
deal
with
that
issue
if
it
got
to
me
before
20
minutes
after
10.
now,
it
is
--
mr.
pollak
is
going
to
deal
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
thought
i
was
in
1964,
but
for
the
last
10
minutes,
i've
almost
been
trembling
because
i
haven't
heard
such
come
from
a
governmental
body
since
hitler
used
to
make
speeches
indicating
about
the
superiority
of
one
race
or
justifying
why
jews
and
gentiles
could
not
associate.
i
think
this
--
this
statement
reaffirms
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
separate
but
equal
cannot
exist
in
a
democratic
society.
certainly,
to
say
that
the
justification
for
this
law
is
that
people
in
florida
want
to
be
able
to
live
presumably
with
a
negro
woman
but
then,
when
they
want
to
walk
away,
they
want
to
be
able
to
walk
away,
not
give
her
property,
not
go
through
a
divorce
and
yet
be
able
to
marry
someone
else,
and
that's
the
justification
for
this
law.
i'd
like
to
say
that
since
we
have
referred
to
or
my
friend
has
referred
to
justice
harlan,
the
elder
or
the
former
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
we
will
rely
upon
his
statement
that
the
constitution
is
colorblind.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
proof
of
the
marriage
in
the
record,
if
you
will
turn
to
page
82
and
83,
you
will
find
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
state
could
use
or
rely
upon
to
show
that
the
parties
had
been
married
previously.
now,
with
respect
to
the
woman
appellate,
the
sole
evidence
is
that
at
one
time,
she
was
known
as
connie
gonzales
and
another
time
as
connie
hoffman.
and
in
each
case,
she
was
asked
by
the
person
that
mainly
testify,
“were
you”
--
testified,
“were
you
legally
married
to
these
persons?”
and
she
said,
“no”,
that's
the
evidence.
and
as
my
friend
said,
apparently
in
florida
--
apparently
they
play
a
game
of
being
associated
with
someone
and
you
walk
away
because
you're
not
legally
married.
now
--
and
also,
with
respect
to
dewey
mclaughlin,
the
sole
evidence
is
on
page
82
where
he
was
asked
in
1961
whether
he
was
married,
single,
separated,
divorced,
or
a
widower
and
he
said
separated,
and
i
asked
for
the
name
of
his
wife
and
he
said
willie
mae
mclaughlin
and
he
did
not
know
her
address.
now,
this
is
in
1961.
certainly,
almost
in
--
almost
every
state
in
the
union
within
a
year,
you
can
go
through
a
formal
divorce.
the
state
did
not
prove
that.
now,
i'd
like
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
time
meeting
the
one
argument
which
i
think
the
state
advanced
and
we
should
spend
some
time
with,
and
that
is
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
i
understand
the
argument,
the
argument
asked
that
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
certain
things
were
included,
certain
things
were
excluded.
then
thereafter,
there
was
a
judgment
made
to
put
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
as
to
protect
what
was
in
the
act
of
1866.
and
he
says
that
because
he
can
point
to
a
legislative
history
in
the
act
of
1866
that
miscegenation
was
not
covered
or
anti-miscegenation
statute,
that
ergo
it
couldn't
be
within
the
range
or
the
reach
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
you
first
should
understand
and
realize
when
you
examine
his
brief
that
he
does
not
--
the
state
does
not
--
any
place,
and
i
repeat,
any
place
point
to
any
legislation
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
the
issue
of
anti-miscegenation
was
discussed.
so,
the
--
all
the
legislative
history
is
in
the
statute.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
his
first
burden
is
to
explain
in
a
way
the
fact
that
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
debate,
there's
no
such
discussion.
i
think
that's
conclusive.
secondly,
as
i
understand
his
argument,
he
says,
“well,
education
wasn't
discussed.
why?
because
education
at
that
time
wasn't
developed,
but
it
got
developed
afterwards,
therefore
the
congress
did
not
think
about
that”.
well,
i
happen
to
be
involved
in
the
1954
decision
and
our
friends
on
the
other
side
gave
us
a
lot
of
legislative
history
saying
that
schools
were
discussed.
so,
i
don't
think,
when
you
start
at
the
first
part
that
you
can
say
that
the
legislation
was
a
--
the
legislative
history
was
absent.
but
more
important,
it
seems
to
me
the
thrust
of
his
argument
is
that
if
the
item
was
fully
developed
at
the
time
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
then
you
have
to
be
able
to
look
in
the
legislative
history
and
see
what
the
resolution
was,
and
the
only
--
in
those
things
which
were
not
fully
developed,
can
you
have
the
right
now
to
determine
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
should've
mean.
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
ever
since
runney
mead
in
1215,
or
whenever
runney
mead
was
and
i'm
pretty
sure
you
could
recall
the
date,
that
trial
by
jury
existed
and
trial
by
jury
i
think
predates
public
education
and
it
probably
predates
anti-miscegenation
as
far
as
whites
with
african
negroes
are
concerned.
and
it's
clear
that
in
the
1866
act,
congress
did
not
talk
about
juries
and
juries
were
not
included,
but
nevertheless,
we
do
know
that
the
court
has
determined
that
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
to
jury
selection.
secondly,
i've
read
and
heard
about
rottenburg
in
england
long
before
the
act
of
1866,
but
yet
we
know
just
this
last
term,
the
court
met
the
issue
on
reapportionment.
and
i
could
go
down
and
indicate
a
lot
of
things
where
they
were
developed
much
more
in
education
in
that
particular
problem.
i
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
as
we
understand
the
fourteenth
amendment,
when
it
was
adopted,
the
country
thought
it
pretty
--
it
meant
pretty
much
what
we
think
it
means
today
but
what
happened,
as
a
result
of
the
compromise
of
1877,
that
there
was
a
drawing
back
on
the
amendment.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
burns
versus
state
which
was
decided
in
1872,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
and
in
1872,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
no
trouble
with
--
when
reading
the
act
of
1866
and
also
reading
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
hold
and
to
hold
clearly
that
anti-miscegenation
statutes
were
unconstitutional
and
it
was
only
because
of
this
court's
earlier
decision
which
developed
this
doctrine
of
‘separate
but
equal'
which
we
all
know
now
was
not
--
can
no
longer
endure,
that
the
states
began
to
get
the
sophistication
that
perhaps
we
could
save
these
laws.
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
you
read
this
decision
and
you
will
find
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
no
difficulty.
now
just
one
detail
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
when
you
asked
about
dewey
mclaughlin,
he
--
on
page
56,
it
says
he
was
born
in
honduras
and
if
my
geography
is
correct,
i
think
that's
in
central
america.
and
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
state
as
we
started,
that
we
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
any
statute
which
mentions
the
word
“race”
and
on
that
basis
gives
or
withholds
rights
to
american
citizens
is
clearly
unconstitutionally
--
unconstitutional
and
that's
basically
what
this
case
is
about,
whether
you
approach
the
statute
under
which
these
people
were
convicted
or
the
anti-miscegenation
statute.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
sir,
i
would
personally
think
that
statute
--
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
think
that
a
person,
because
he
happened
to
be
convicted
of
crime
a,
should
be
deprived
of
what
basically
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
but
sir,
i
--
i
frankly
don't
think
it's
different.
i'd
like
to
say,
in
our
state
of
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
we've
been
able
to
convince
the
attorney
general
that
there
should
have
been
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no,
no.
i
have
--
i
have
no
trouble
at
all
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
and
i
--
i
don't
depend
upon
association.
i
just
depend
upon
the
right
of
a
man
to
be
able
to
pick
and
choose
and
do
what
he
wishes
and
that
his
race
should
be
irrelevant.
i
don't
say
that
you
have
to
make
people
mix,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
government
--
government
just
can't
tell
a
man
and
a
woman
or
can't
tell
two
people
that
based
upon
their
relevant
accidental
consideration
of
race,
that
none
of
us
could
determine,
none
of
us
could
choose,
that
on
that
basis,
you
could
put
me
in
jail,
you
can
kick
me
out
of
school,
or
you
can
do
anything
else.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
i
would
think
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
think
it's
irrelevant
but
i
would
--
with
admirable
candor,
i
think
the
state
of
florida
has
said
that
we
are
right
as
we
read
the
law,
that
--
that
the
laws
are
different.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
--
on
that
point,
that's
the
totality
of
the
record.
there
are
at
least
five
places
in
the
record
where
there's
evidence
for
which
i
think
a
jury
could
find
that
there
was
a
common
law
marriage.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
the
problem
--
if
would
look
at
the
record
sir,
you
will
see
that
the
person
that
tried
the
case
--
the
red
light
is
on
and
i
guess
i
have
to
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh,
that
the
person
--
i
think
mr.
pollak
owes
the
court
a
minute.
i'm
trying
to
give
it
back
to
you.
but
that
the
person
that
tried
the
case
below
asked
for
an
instruction,
no.
4,
with
--
on
the
issue
of
common
law
marriage,
and
the
judge
said,
“i'm
not
going
to
give
your
instruction.
i'm
going
to
give
my
own”.
and
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh,
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
as
--
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
that
if
the
appellants
had
been
able
to
show
that
they
had
entered
into
a
common
law
marriage
outside
of
florida,
because
they've
both
been
domiciled
outside
of
florida,
then
the
conflict
rule
of
law
--
and
i
think
the
florida
statute
would
say
that
they
would've
been
married
in
florida
and
the
anti-miscegenation
law
didn't
apply,
and
when
you
read
the
charter,
i
think
that's
quite
clear.
he
said,
“he
gave
the
general
instruction
on
common
law
marriage.
he
pointed
out
that
the
statute
applied
only
outs
--
only
in
florida”,
all
the
evidence
to
this
fact
that
they
were
involved
in
a
common
law
marriage
dealt
with
the
fact
that
they
first
met
each
other
in
miami,
florida
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
ever
had
been
together
outside
of
florida.
so
therefore,
he
had
to
give
the
common
law
instruction
under
florida
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
but
then,
he
says
that
the
florida
statute,
and
indeed
the
constitution,
says
that
negro
and
white
cannot
enter
into
a
common
law
marriage
in
florida.
and
if
you
want
to
use
the
biblical
expression,
he
gave
it
to
me
in
one
hand
and
he
took
away
from
the
other.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes.
he
did,
sir.
i
think
he
did.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
well.
