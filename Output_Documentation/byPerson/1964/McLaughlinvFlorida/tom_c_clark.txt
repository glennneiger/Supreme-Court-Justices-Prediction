the
common
law
marriage
was
taken
away.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
said
the
issue
on
the
common
law
marriage
was
taken
away.
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
the
defendant
put
on
any
defense?
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
i
read
your
--
as
i
read
your
brief
--
well,
you
seem
to
contend
that
the
state
has
not
met
the
burden
of
proof,
that
is
they
have
not
proved
on
that
these
parties
are
not
married.
are
you
abandoning
that
now?
justice
tom
c.
clark
didn't
you
prove
that
they
lived
in
florida
for
a
certain
period?
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
in
mexico,
i
believe
every
state
in
the
united
states
requires
some
residence
of
some
type.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
was
wondering
whether
or
not
if
the
statute
requires
proof
of
them
not
being
married
and
you
introduce
proof
that
they
were
married
and,
therefore,
they
could
not
be
married.
it
was
about
a
year,
as
i
remember,
between
the
evidence
--
the
date
that
the
man
had
said
that
he
was
married
to
willie,
i
believe
her
name
was,
and
the
time
of
this
offense.
and,
so,
i
thought
perhaps
some
evidence
that
the
florida
records
did
not
show
any
divorce
during
that
period
might
be
of
some
probative
value.what
would
you
think
of
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
usually,
the
burden
is
on
them
to
prove
they
were
married.
