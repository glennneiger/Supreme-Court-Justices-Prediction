strongly
there's
no
cohabitation
in
the
statute
that
applies
to
people
of
the
same
race?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
this
is
the
so
called
fornication?
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

is
that
the
law
here?

(inaudible)
justice

if
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
they're
punished
on
the
same
basis?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
very
difficult
to
deal
with
the
question,
the
argument
of
vagueness
without
an
implicit
assumption
that
if
the
statute
had
not
been
vague,
it
would
have
been
alright.
it's
pretty
hard
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
we
can't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
pretty
difficult
to
avoid
this
question
by
the
vagueness
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
deal,
mr.
coleman,
or
is
mr.
pollak
going
to
deal
with
the
argument
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
taking
in
the
context
of
which
--
of
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
and
the
first
civil
rights
bill,
the
civil
rights
bill
of
1866,
was
excluded
from
the
reach
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
put
my
question
that
way.
i
said
whether
you're
going
to
discuss
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
take
--
i
take
that
you
start
from
the
premise
and
that's
the
way
i
read
your
reply
brief,
that
if
we
had
simply
the
freedmen's
bill
--
the
freedmen's
bureau
bill
or
the
civil
rights
bill
of
1866
and
we
had
this
question,
the
anti-miscegenation
question,
under
those
bills
you
would
agree
with
the
state
that
they
were
not
within
the
ambit
of
those
bills.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
seem
to
say
that
in
your
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
go
further
than
that
in
your
brief
and
recognize
it,
i
think.
now,
isn't
--
isn't
the
question
that
you
should
address
yourself
to
was,
if
that
is
the
premise,
whether
the
legislative
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
--
itself
contains
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
that
it
was
intended
to
draw
back
or
leave
the
courts
free
or
leave
the
legislature
free
to
deal
with
the
anti-miscegenation
questions
which,
on
the
premise
that
you
start
from
i
think
that
you
--
i
understood
you
to
start
from,
were
excluded
from
the
earlier
legislation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
read
mr.
bickel's
article
though,
he
doesn't
suggest
that
there
was
any
of
that
compromise
as
you
call
it.
it
was
anything
more
than
a
subjective
compromise
which
he
infers.
it
wasn't
an
expressed
compromise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
when
we
deal
with
ordinary
statutory
construction,
we
frequently,
even
sometimes
when
the
words
of
the
statute,
plain
meaning
if
you
please,
would
indicate
one
result
and
we
find
the
legislative
history
that
puts
a
gloss
on
that
interpretation,
we
of
course
interpret
this
statute
as,
we
think
it
was
the
intent
of
congress,
it
should
be
construed.
there's
no
different
approach
surely
when
it
comes
to
construing
what
is
within
and
without
a
particular
constitutional
provision
in
terms
of
the
so-called
legislative
history
that
preceded
it.
you
wouldn't
disagree
with
that,
would
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
referred
to
the
--
what
you
described
as
the
paramount
interest
of
the
state
in
this
area.
do
you
recognize
any
degree
of
the
state
difference
and
the
degree
of
the
state
interest
is
between
marriage
laws
and
education
--
public
school
education?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
i
just
have
one
question
for
you
which
is
just
a
little
bit
reverse
of
justice
stewart's.
supposing
your
premise
is
accepted
namely,
that
because
of
this
legislative
history,
miscegenation
statutes
were
excluded
from
the
reach
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
that
a
miscegenation
statute,
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned,
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
state.
why
wouldn't
it
follow
a
fortiori
that
the
state
had
power
equally
to
apply
racial
considerations
to
an
elicit
relationship
or
a
relationship
of
this
kind
where
the
parties
weren't
married?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
had
no
legislative
history
at
all.you
just
had
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
words
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
wait
a
minute,
the
words
of
it,
if
i
may,
or
supposing
that
your
argument
on
the
legislative
history
is
rejected,
what's
your
position
then?
