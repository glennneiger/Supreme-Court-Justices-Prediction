mr.
harry
norman
ball
may
it
please
the
court.
the
coverage
under
these
policies
was
the
payment
of
benefits
prescribed
in
the
policies
resulting
from
injury
through
accident
in
connection
with
an
airplane
flight.
of
course
there
was
an
infinitesimal
possibility
fortunately
that
any
liability,
whatever
accrued
and
of
course
everybody
hoped
that
the
contingency,
the
accident
would
never
occur.
now
it
is
this
fact
which
i
will
develop
which
shows
that
this
kind
of
coverage
does
not
posses
the
requirements
as
intended
by
congress
under
the
congressional
policy
which
mr.
chief
justice
asked
about
in
the
beginning.
this
type
of
policy
is
not
covered
by
the
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
1918
and
is
not
covered
by
the
intent
of
congress
which
has
persisted
to
this
very
day.
prior
to
1918,
when
the
estate
tax
was
imposed,
there
was
no
inclusion
of
life
insurance
policy
proceeds
except
those
which
came
into
the
estate
physically
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
executor
in
his
fiduciary
capacity
was
a
beneficiary.
congress
had
before
it
the
question
of
tax
evasion
or
avoidance
under
which
wealthy
persons
could
take
from
their
estates
large
sums
of
money,
put
those
sums
into
life
insurance
and
in
that
way
create
for
their
beneficiaries
distributions
which
would
escape
estate
taxation.
it
was
this
situation
which
congress
tried
to
eliminate
by
enacting
the
section
which
said
that
hereafter,
proceeds
on
life
policies
will
be
included
if
the
insured
took
out
the
policies
and
if
the
proceeds
exceed
$40,000.
the
court
will
please
observe
that
only
way
that
this
intent
could
be
translated
to
insurance
would
be
in
connection
with
the
translation
to
life
insurance.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
life
insurance
is
inherently
a
form
of
investment
or
contract
which
looks
toward
the
future
and
looks
towards
the
protection
of
beneficiaries.
and
the
reason
why
that
is
so
is
because
the
insurance
carrier,
when
he
enters
into
a
contract,
is
just
as
certain
to
have
to
pay
to
the
beneficiary
or
to
the
estate
as
the
case
may
be
as
there
is
a
certainty
of
death.
of
course
this
is
in
complete
contrast
with
a
flight
accident
policy
where
the
probability
of
payment
is
infinitesimal
and
almost
negligible
and
as
i
say,
it
is
fortunate
that,
that
is
the
situation.
now
the
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
i
would
think
that
since
that
is
truly
life
insurance
that,
that
would
fall
within
2042.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
the
statute
says
insurance
on
the
life.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
but
reading
that
statute
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
intent,
it
is
clear
we
submit
that
the
only
kind
of
insurance
that
could
have
been
useful
and
could
have
been
meant
in
thwarting
the
concept
which
the
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
was
through
life
insurance.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
it
may
not
be
specifically
covered
by
the
congressional
intent
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
probably
not
sir,
but
since
general
life
insurance
company
was
--
life
insurance
policies
were
certainly
included
under
this
intent,
then
i
must
say
that
this
type
of
insurance
even
though
it's
taken
out
for
the
purpose
of
insuring
a
creditor
is
still
life
insurance
and
the
same
treatment
would
be
accorded.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
and
may
i
answer
justice
harlan's
question
about
term
insurance.
term
insurance
in
the
usual
sense
is
nothing
more
than
regular
insurance
without
cash
value.
there
is
a
term
which
is
non-cancelable,
goes
for
life.
there
are
modifications
of
that,
but
term
insurance
in
our
view
is
covered
by
2042
for
the
reason
that
it
is
life
insurance
and
may
i
at
this
point
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
no
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
there
is
little
or
no
cash
value
in
the
true
life
insurance
policy
does
not
take
it
out
of
the
contemplation
of
congress
for
this
reason
that
in
every
life
insurance
policy,
be
it
term
or
20
payment
life
or
endowment
and
of
course
it
is
easier
to
envisage
a
situation
where
for
example,
an
insured
goes
out
and
buys
a
single
premium
payment
life
insurance
policy.
he
pays
$25,000
or
$30,000
for
a
single
premium
policy,
and
then
that
is
a
definite
depletion
of
estate
--
of
his
estate
to
that
extent,
but
the
other
life
insurance
also
has
a
built-in
value
which
must
be
considered
because
of
the
fact
that
the
insured's
expectancy
of
death
furnishes
a
value
in
all
kinds
of
life
insurance
which
the
insured
has
in
his
estate
until
such
time
as
he
dies.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
no
your
honor,
payment
had
been
made
on
that
policy
and
i
think
it
was
a
mistake.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
i
said
that
policy
was
included
by
the
department,
and
payment
of
the
tax
made,
i
think
it
was
a
mistake.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
i
hope
we're
not
too
late,
we
might
still
do
so.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
we
haven't
made
it.
we
haven't
done
anything
about
it.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
my
argument
would
be
different
if
this
was
a
straight
payment
for
death
from
any
cause;
heart
attack,
disease
or
any
other
cause
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
no,
my
argument
would
be
the
same.
i'd
say
if
it
was
a
straight
policy
for
death
alone,
it
still
would
not
be
includable.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
life
insurance
is
distinguished
from
that
kind
of
policy
because
there
is
a
certainty
of
death.
the
certainty
of
death
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
expectancy
tables
decide
that
on
the
average
an
individual,
a
human
being
will
die
over
a
certain
period
of
time.
it
is
this
certainty
of
death
and
this
certainty
payment
that
supports
the
use
of
this
kind
of
coverage
for
estate
planning.
it
is
this
kind
of
coverage
which
i
suggest
was
in
the
mind
of
congress
when
it
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
we
like
to
hope
so
your
honor.
it's
a
bad
tragedy
when
anybody
is
killed,
of
course
the
airlines
say
that
the
averages
are
wonderful
and
of
course
they
don't
count
to
the
person
who
was
struck.
but
the
possibility
on
a
mathematical
basis
is
very
slight.
now
for
example,
out
of
77
million
flights
in
1963,
there
were
264
deaths.
now
i
might
make
the
point
at
this
time
that
since
that
statistic
indicates
the
amount
of
controversy
that
there
might
have
been
involved,
i
suggest
that
it
was
so
negligible
as
not
to
be
able
to
say
that
it
was
before
congress
because
assuming
as
the
record
indicates
that
7
or
8
million
policies
of
this
kind
are
taken
out
a
year
which
would
be
about
10%
and
of
the
264
deaths,
10%
would
be
26.
now
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
that
may
be
true
your
honor,
but
it
has
not
as
yet
gone
so
far
as
to
have
congress
declare
a
different
intent.
now
it
may
very
well
be
that
congress
could
say
that
proceeds
from
policies
because
of
the
death
of
any
individual
in
an
accident
or
otherwise
are
includable.
it
may
properly
be
able
to
say
that,
but
it
has
not
done
so
as
yet
and
as
the
government
says,
they're
asking
that
this
court
say,
“now
congress,
if
you
want
to
make
an
exception
of
flight
accident
policies,
it
is
up
to
you
to
make
the
exception
out
of
2042.”
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
you
can't
make
an
exception
and
take
something
out
before
it's
put
in.
what
the
government
is
saying
to
this
court
is
that,
they're
asking
this
court
to
extend
and
stretch
the
language
of
2042
beyond
the
phrases
and
the
words
used
in
that
section
and
beyond
the
congressional
intent,
and
the
purpose
is
sought
to
be
achieved
by
congress.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
that
question
if
it
pleases
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
beneficiary
might
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
that
money,
income
tax
or
otherwise.
now
probably
congress
could
impose
a
tax
on
the
beneficiary
income
or
otherwise,
it
could
call
this
gain
or
profit
or
income
and
if
it
chose
to
do
so
and
thereby
impose
the
tax
on
the
beneficiary,
but
so
far
as
the
estate
tax
is
concerned,
we
submit
that
it
cannot
do
so.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
i
would
say
sir
in
this
type
of
policy,
it
cannot
do
so
for
the
reason
that
there
is
no
significant
value
in
the
policy
which
i
suggest
is
necessary
for
the
decedent
to
have
at
the
time
of
his
death
in
order
to
enable
the
government
to
tax
a
transfer.
in
other
words,
there
has
to
be
something
of
significant
value
in
the
decedent
at
the
time
of
his
death
in
order
to
say
well
we
are
taxing
the
transfer
of
this
economic
value
which
the
decedent
had.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
such
economic
value
in
a
flight
accident
policy
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
that
it
could
be
taxed
because
if
it
were,
it
would
be
probably
taking
property
without
due
process
and
probably
a
direct
tax
which
is
proscribed.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
your
honor
that
is,
in
someway,
there
are
some
similarities,
but
in
a
double
indemnity
policy
attached
or
part
of,
inherently
part
of
a
life
policy,
the
basic
contingency
is
death.
now
the
double
indemnity
establishes
the
amount
of
payment
and
to
that
extent,
when
you
have
it
all
in
one,
i
would
say
that
those
proceeds
might
properly
be
included.
but
if
the
double
indemnity
feature
is
taken
out
of
the
life
policy
and
is
represented
by
a
single
policy
referring
only
to
death
from
accident,
then
i
say
that
falls
within
our
position
that
it
is
not
includible
under
section
2042.
now
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
and
of
course
i
think
properly
so,
the
certainty
of
the
payment
under
a
life
insurance
policy,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
definite
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
insurance
carrier
to
pay
and
under
life
insurance,
the
built-in
value
which
i
suggested
a
moment
ago
as
being
in
there
because
of
the
expectancy
of
death
in
every
life
policy
creates
the
immediate
estate
which
if
there
is
a
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
becomes
taxable
at
the
moment
of
death
of
because
that
right
in
the
beneficiary
is
frozen.
it
cannot
be
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
i
did
sir.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
the
economic
interest
in
every
life
policy
is
the
value,
the
built-in
value
emanating
from
the
fact
that
the
insured,
every
insured
has
an
expectancy
of
death.
now
to
illustrate,
if
there
is
a
pure
term
policy
without
any
cash
values
on
an
individual
say
95
years
of
age,
say
there's
a
$100,000
policy
on
his
life,
he
has
under
the
tables
will
say
two-and-a-half
years
expectancy
or
perhaps
a
little
bit
more,
but
let's
say
three
for
the
sake
of
argument.
now,
without
any
cash
value
in
that
policy,
the
expectancy
of
death
would
make
that
policy
worth
approximately
$30,000
and
it
is
this
expectancy
of
death
which
furnishes
the
built-in
value
in
every
life
insurance
policy
which
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
yes,
assuming
that
he
had
the
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
there
is
no
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
but
your
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
but
if
the
court
pleases,
in
the
life
policy,
even
if
it
be
for
a
term
of
one
year,
there
is
a
definite
expectancy
of
death
and
not
that
the
death
is
going
to
happen
within
the
year
necessarily,
but
that
there
is
that
expectancy
on
the
basis
of
tables
which
is
measurable
but
you
don't
have
that
at
all
in
a
flight
policy
where
there
is
no
definite
assurance
that
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
that
is
my
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
and
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
make
the
point
to
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
this
insures
against
death
through
the
accident
but
the
possibility
of
death
by
accident
is
poles
apart
from
the
possibility
or
the
probability
of
death
of
every
human
being
based
on
his
life
expectancy.
you
just
don't
have
that
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
the
expectancy
of
dying
within
in
a
year
is
far
less
than
the
expectancy
of
dying
within
25
or
30,
the
life
of
expectancy
but
it's
still
there.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
well
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
really
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
possibility
of
death
in
an
airplane
accident
just
is
so
insignificant
that
it
cannot
be
mathematically
or
actually
figured
and
that's
why
i
say
that
it
is
so
far
apart
from
the
life
coverage
regardless
of
whether
the
life
coverage
is
full
life,
20
permanent
life
or
even
when
it's
on
a
limited
term
basis.
you
just
can't
talk
about
both
those
coverages
in
the
same
breath.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
because
the
government
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
indemnity
for
injury,
and
it
fixes
a
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
that's
the
argument
that
i'm
trying
to
make
sir.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
well
then
that
was
my
error.
the
whole
basis
of
the
argument
is
that
this
is
not
a
life
policy,
it's
true.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
had
he
been
injured
in
certain
ways
sir?
mr.
harry
norman
ball
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
by
accident
or
pay
the
principal
sum.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
not
an
addition,
either/or.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
as
a
result
of
an
accident.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
but
the
only
regulation
that
was
before
congress
during
these
years
is
the
regulation
which
said
insurance,
life
insurance
of
every
description
and
there
was
nothing
before
congress,
of
course
we
know
which
talked
about
the
proceeds
from
accidental
death
policies
at
all
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
great
controversy.
i
think
the
government
admits
that
there
was
not
any
great
controversy
during
that
period.
so
that
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
i
don't
know
how
much
taxes
it
did
collect
in
this
context.
mr.
harry
norman
ball
yes,
but
in
the
absence
of
controversy
or
in
the
absence
of
awareness
by
congress
it
would
seem
that
it
can't
be
said
that
congress
intended
that
this
section
which
by
its
terms
did
not
include
proceeds
from
accident
policies
should
be
included.
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
that
section
could
have
been
amended
had
they
so
desired.
now
in
that
connection
on
the
basic
differences
between
these
coverages,
i
come
to
the
question
of
the
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
which
was
the
printed
provision
in
the
policy.
incidentally
i
do
not
agree
that
the
right
of
the
insured
to
collect
if
the
injury
caused
the
loss
of
arms
or
legs
i
do
not
call
that
an
incident
of
ownership,
because
i
think
the
term
incident
of
ownership
which
was
phrased
by
this
court
in
the
chase
case
is
a
term
which
is
confined
to
life
insurance
policies.
i'm
sorry
i
see
that
my
time
is
up,
i
just
--
mr.
harry
norman
ball
that
incident
of
ownership
test
throughout
the
cases
really
covers
a
situation
where
there
was
a
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
plus
some
economic
advantage
in
the
policy
which
i
adverted
to
before
now.
if
you
don't
have
that
and
if
you're
not
--
and
you
don't
have
a
life
insurance
policy
before
you
then
the
term
incident
of
ownership
does
not
apply.
and
i
say
that
the
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
even
if
it
existed
in
this
boiler
plate
did
not
rise
to
the
incident
of
ownership.
i
say
that
the
government
should
not
take
a
part
of
this
fund
which
might
represent
the
breadwinner's
value
to
his
family
unless
there
is
a
clear
congressional
mandate
which
is
not
present
at
this
time.
thank
you
very
much.
