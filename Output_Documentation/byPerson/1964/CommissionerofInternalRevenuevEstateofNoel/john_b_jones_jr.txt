mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
applicability
of
the
federal
estate
tax
to
the
proceeds
of
airplane
flight
insurance
paid
on
the
death
of
one
who
has
died
in
an
airplane
accident.
the
facts
are
undisputed.
on
the
evening
of
june
19,
1956
the
decedent
and
his
wife
went
to
idlewild
airport
from
which
he
was
taking
a
trip
to
venezuela.
in
that
airport
he
applied
for
two
flight
insurance
policies
in
face
amount
of
$62,500
each,
totaling
a
$125,000
for
a
premium
of
$2.50
each.
he
signed
a
written
application
to
each
of
the
two
companies
and
in
that
application
he
named
his
wife
ruth
as
the
beneficiary.
he
specified
that
his
trip
was
to
be
a
roundtrip
between
new
york
and
puerto
ordaz
in
venezuela.
he
gave
application,
his
application
to
the
clerk,
who
validated
them
and
on
instructions
of
the
decedent
handed
them
to
the
wife
who
kept
them
until
they
will
later
surrendered
for
payment.
there
is
perhaps
some
disagreement
in
this
record
as
to
who
paid
the
premium
for
the
policy.
while
we
don't
think
anything
in
this
case,
in
its
present
posture
would
turn
on
that,
we
note
that
the
tax
court
judge,
although
we
had
testimonies
from
the
wife
that
she
had
paid
the
premium,
and
refused
to
make
that
finding.
they
expressed
some
question.
the
third
circuit
on
the
other
hand
in
stating
the
facts
of
the
case
did
go
ahead
and
made
that
finding
though
without
discussing
the
point.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
it's
a
sentence
of
the
record
--
it's
at
page
49
of
the
record
just
says
she
paid
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they
were
aware
in
the
third
circuit
that
they
were
making
a
finding
which
the
tax
court
have
refused
to
make.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
it
would
be
at
significance
if
he
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right.
we
have
an
additional
argument
relating
to
a
gift
in
contemplation
of
death,
which
is
before
the
court
at
this
time.
it
would
not
be
a
gift,
if
she
had
herself
paid
for
the
policy.
that
would
be
the
only
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
present
significance.
each
of
these
policies
provided
for
payments
in
specified
amounts
for
certain
bodily
injuries
such
as
loss
of
limb
or
sight
resulting
from
accident
in
the
contemplated
airplane
flight
and
provided
for
the
payment
of
the
principle
sum
on
loss
of
life.
each
policy
also
reserved
the
right
in
the
insured
to
assign
the
policy
and
to
change
beneficiaries.
at
12:31
am
approximately
just
less
than
three
hours
after
it
took
off
the
plane
crashed
into
the
atlantic
ocean
and
everyone
on
board
was
killed.
on
due
application
by
his
widow
under
the
policy,
she
received
a
$125,000
from
the
two
companies.
these
amounts
were
not
included
in
the
estate
tax
return
filed
on
behalf
of
the
decedent.
the
commissioner
asserted
a
deficiency
and
the
case
proceeded
in
due
course
to
the
tax
court
which
upheld
the
deficiency,
but
on
the
petitioner's
appeal
to
the
third
circuit,
third
circuit
reversed
the
decision
for
the
government
and
held
that
these
particular
policies
were
not
insurance
under
policies
on
the
life
of
the
decedent
as
required
by
section
2042
(2)
of
the
code.
that
code
section
is
in
relevant
portion
set
forth
at
page
16
of
our
brief
and
virtually
all
of
the
discussion
in
this
case
will
revolve
about
those
words,
insurance
under
policies
on
the
life
of
the
decedent
as
set
forth
in
page
16
there.
our
position
before
this
court
is
that
the
third
circuit
was
wrong
for
four
reasons
and
that
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
should
be
reversed
and
that
of
the
tax
court
reinstated.
first
we
would
meet
the
third
circuit
in
the
terms
in
which
it
spoke.
it
suggested
that
somehow
this
language
which
i've
just
quoted
is
not
clear
and
that
it's
necessary
to
make
considerable
construction.
we
think
that
the
third
circuit
got
into
that
error
by
equating
the
quoted
phrase
insurance
under
policies
on
the
life
of
the
decedent
with
life
insurance
and
then
find
a
fact
which
no
one
disputes
that
life
insurance
is
quite
different
from
accident
insurance
and
it
would
be
our
view
that
the
statute
rather
pointedly
refrained
from
using
the
term
life
insurance
and
says
rather
insurance
under
policies
on
the
life
of
the
decedent,
which
it
would
seem
at
least
as
reasonable
reading
and
in
our
view
the
better
reading
to
say
that
this
includes
all
policies
under
which
death
is
the
occasion
for
payment
of
the
proceeding.
and
we
think
that
this
spirit
and
the
spirit
that
animates
the
choice
of
language
in
the
section
is
picked
up
in
the
regulation,
which
have
been
with
us
for
30
or
40
years,
which
provide
that
the
term
insurance
refers
to
life
insurance
of
every
description.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
legislative
history
is
quoted
in
the
opinions
below.
i
think
it
does
not
focus
on
the
fact
that
there
might
be
ordinary
life
insurance
policies
and
accident
life
insurance
policies
that
would
cover
on
death.
what
it
does
do
and
this
comes
in
a
little
later
in
the
argument,
it
does
give
some
support
to
the
theory
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
--
at
one
time
there
was
no
tax
on
life
insurance
to
a
named
beneficiary
and
at
that
time
this
was
put
in
and
they
wanted
to
have
a
rule
which
made
it
clear
that
insurance
payable
to
a
beneficiary
other
than
the
estate
was
part
of
the
estate
and
that
is
really
all
legislative
history
deals
with.
i
don't
think
either
side
has
cited
anything
more
helpful
than
that
and
that
this
is
i
believe
amply
discussed
in
both
briefs.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
i
think
that
i've
covered
the
clarity
of
the
language
its
really
all
i
wanted
to
say
on
that
and
our
second
reason
for
doing
this
is,
for
taking
this
position
is,
it's
all
very
well
for
us
to
sit
here
and
look
at
this
one
flight
policy
which
is
after
all
is
going
to
last
for
a
very
short
time,
it
doesn't
have
much
intrinsic
value
as
a
piece
of
paper,
it
isn't
worth
any
more
than
the
$5.00
that
was
paid
on
it
until
the
fact
that
the
accident
which
instantly
makes
it
payable
in
its
full
amount
and
there's
not
going
to
be
a
trading
market
in
these
policies,
it's
not
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
transferred.
and
if
you
compare
that
with
ordinary
life
insurance,
it's
very
easy
to
see
differences
in
time,
differences
in
nature
and
if
that
was
all
that
was
involved
it
wouldn't
be
too
bad
to
have
a
different
rule
for
these
flight
insurance
policies
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ordinary
life
on
the
other,
but
the
difficulty
is
that,
in
our
view,
this
is
a
--
the
insurance
policies
really
fill
out
a
spectrum
of
which
this
policy
would
be
off
to
this
side,
let's
say
a
flight
insurance
policy
would
last
a
very
short
time
and
covers
a
single
flight.
and
maybe
the
next
one
over
in
the
line
would
be
an
annual
policy
and
some
people
are
covering
only
airplane
accidents
and
then
the
next
one
would
be
the
term
insurance
which
your
honor
mentioned
and
then
their
might
be
renewable
term
insurance
and
then
there
might
be
ordinary
life
insurance
with
double
indemnity
and
then
there
might
be
ordinary
life
insurance
without
double
indemnity.
and
our
view
is
that
the
distinction
which
was
picked
by
the
third
circuit
was
to
say
that
ordinary
life
insurance
and
that
which
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
section,
is
that
which
ensures
against
an
inevitable
event.
well
you
can't
make
that
statement
about
term
insurance,
because
term
insurance
insures
only
against
death
during
a
10
year,
20
or
whatever
the
agreed
term
is.
now
this
is
a
form
of
term
insurance,
it
covers
a
limited
cause
of
death.
it
has
a
12-month
actual
limitation
in
it,
but
it
would
be
terminated
shorter
if
the
roundtrip
terminates
before
that.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
oh,
no
question
about
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
i
would.
i
say
this,
i
don't
think
anybody
has
ever,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase,
had
the
nerve
to
suggest
that
it
was
not
includable
in
the
estate.
until
this
decision
of
the
third
circuit
i
don't
know
how
you
would
have
made
the
argument
and
i'm
not
sure
that
in
the
brief,
petitioners
go
away
from
that.
they
don't
think
that
they
can
soundly
argue
that
term
insurance
ought
to
be
excluded
and
in
fact
in
this
particular
case
if
the
record
on
pages
23
and
24
you
will
find
that
this
man
had
an
annual
airplane
accident
life
insurance
policy.
i
didn't
mean
to
use
life
insurance,
i
beg
your
pardon,
but
covering
his
loss
of
life
in
an
airplane
accident
and
he
didn't
make
any
effort
to
apply
this
rule
to
this
policy.
he
agrees
that
there
is
something
more
in
that
policy
that
he
just
--
he
couldn't
come
into
court
and
claim
that,
that
wasn't
includable
in
his
estate.
and
whereas
under
the
rationale
of
the
third
circuit
as
adopted
as
we
see
it
you
would
have
to
rule
that
it
wasn't
life
insurance.
so
my
answer
is
that
the
regulations
here,
say
life
insurance
of
every
description,
as
far
as
i
know
there
has
never
been
a
contest
or
even
a
situation
close
enough
that
it
was
necessary
to
issue
a
ruling
suggesting
that
term
insurance
was
includable.
i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
assumption
and
i'm
sure
opposing
counsel
picking
up
that
they
feel
i'm
in
error
in
this
finding.
it's
the
first
time
that
no
one
has
suggested
that
there
was
any
reason
for
exclude.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
that
raises
problems
under
the
alternative
argument
which
is
presented
in
their
brief.
it
does
not
under
the
rationale
which
the
third
circuit
adopted.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
and
that
at
the
time
this
was
advanced
to
judge
brown
he
was
talking
about,
well
if
you
say
there's
any
validity
to
this
argument
about
the
nature
of
insurance
wouldn't
it
necessarily
cover
this
other
policy
too?
and
so
your
honor's
point
is
well
taken,
absent
an
assignment,
there
might
be
very
good
reasons
for
taxing
it
but
not
under
the
third
circuit
rationale.
now,
the
second
reason
or
the
third
reason
for
--
in
our
view
reversing
the
third
circuit
is
that
this
seems
to
us
to
have
been
a
settled
area
of
law.
it
is
true
that
the
decision
is
one
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
which
is
not
high
up
in
the
judicial
structure
of
the
country,
but
it
was
promulgated
in
1929
and
as
far
as
we
know
has
not
been
contested
until
this
case,
or
successfully
contested
until
this
case.
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
page
6
that
the
degree
to
which
it's
been
accepted
by
the
three
textbook
authorities.
opposing
counsel
in
their
briefs
say
well,
they're
not
going
all
out
in
their
endorsement
of
it,
when
they
refer
to
it
in
their
treatises
perhaps
that's
true,
but
i
think
treatise
writers
are
exact
to
take
issue
with
unsound
decisions
as
anybody
and
i
think
in
these
same
treatises
if
there
are
well
established
decisions
with
which
they
are
in
disagreement,
you
will
find
that
they
do
not
hesitate
to
express
it.
and
i
will
think
that
the
fact
that
this
is
reported
is
entitled
to
some
weight,
not
in
any
sense
conclusive
but
it
adds
to
the
picture
which
we
see
here.
and
the
same
thing
maybe
said
for
the
ackerman
decision
being
known
to
congress
over
the
years.
again
respondent
here
states,
well
there's
no
showing
that
this
was
ever
called
to
congress'
attention,
which
we
say
granted
and
if
this
isn't
the
strongest
case
for
congressional
reenactment,
but
at
the
same
time
if
there
was
discontent
with
the
decision
i
think
one
could
expect
that
over
the
course
of
30
years,
it
would
have
been
called
to
the
attention
of
congress
and
fitted
into
the
picture
as
a
whole.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
congress
--
the
inaction
of
congress
supports
the
view
which
we're
now
espousing.
and
the
last
reason
which
we
would
advance
for
the
error
in
the
decision
of
third
circuit
comes
about
from
the
interrelationship
between
the
income
tax
and
the
estate
tax.
there
is
in
section
101
of
the
income
tax
which
is
printed
at
page
17
of
our
brief,
just
facing
the
2042,
a
provision
which
excludes
from
income
amounts
paid
under
a
life
insurance
contract.
and
the
regulations
under
that
section
have
always
felt
that,
that
language
was
strong
enough
to
support
exclusion
of
death
benefits
under
accident
insurance
policy.
it's
the
phrase
under
a
life
insurance
contract,
is
i
would
think
a
narrower
phrase
in
the
statute
to
be
construed
than
that
phrase
policies
on
the
life
of
the
decedent
which
we
have
in
section
2042
in
front
us
now.
and
the
reason
--
the
point
to
be
made
here
is
that
if
the
third
circuit
rationale
is
accepted
then
the
regulations
under
101
are
wrong
and
payments
under
an
accident,
so
called
accident
insurance,
accident
life
insurance
policy
should
not
be
excluded
from
income
under
101
and
the
price
of
obtaining
the
exposition
from
the
estate
would
be
to
have
it
included
in
the
income,
which
in
virtually
every
case
would
be
a
much
more
expensive
proposition
tax
wise.
we
don't
urge
that
and
i
don't
suppose
if
we
lost
this
case
we
would
even
urge
it,
but
it
does
seem
to
us
to
show
that
congress
had
a
very
clear
concept
in
mind
of
what
life
insurance
was
and
that
all
the
pieces
in
the
puzzle
fit
together
until
this
case
came
along
and
it
does
knock
it
considerably
out
of
kilter
and
that
the
uncertainty
should
be
removed
and
that
the
pattern
of
taxation
of
insurance
on
flight
accidents
should
follow
the
pattern
of
all
other
life
insurance.
now
upon
brief
here
the
tax
payer
makes
some
point
about
the
incidence
of
ownership
and
let
me
say
that
this
is
in
our
view
a
more
troubling
and
a
closer
question
under
the
--
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
point
however,
was
dealt
with
unanimously
by
--
neither
the
court
below
disagreed
on
this.
it
seemed
to
us
that
judge
brown
was
aware
of
all
the
arguments,
treated
them
very
carefully
and
was
so
satisfying
to
the
third
circuit
that
they
passed
over
in
a
sentence
with
a
statement
that
decedent
here
clearly
did
have
the
incidence
of
ownership.
if
i
just
outline
the
objections
and
our
answers
to
them
i
might
suggest
one
of
the
most
important
is
a
suggestion
that
somehow
with
the
policies
in
the
wife's
hands
and
the
insured
on
the
airplane,
there
wasn't
any
practical
way
to
exercise
the
power
to
change
the
beneficiary
and
i
would
just
point
out
that
on
that
section
2042
very
clearly
speaks
of
power
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
any
other
person.
and
since
the
most
that
could
be
set
for
facts
is
that
it
puts
it
in
the
joint
control
of
the
decedent
and
his
wife,
that
there
would
be
no
reason
for
allowing
a
person
by
their
own
act
to
just
argue
the
impossibility
of
exercise
when
congress
has
gone
so
far
in
advance
to
cover
the
possibility
of
being
exercisable
with
some
other
person.
and
another
very
practical
possibility
and
one
that
has
to
be
contemplated
is
that
man
who
buys
the
flight
insurance
contract
at
the
counter
is
not
in
a
very
effective
position
to
change
the
beneficiary,
he
goes
from
the
counter,
he
gets
on
the
airplane
and
he's
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
use
the
pilot's
radio.
there's
not,
as
a
practical
matter,
a
great
chance
of
exercising
at
that
point.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right,
but
--
and
this
one
was
roundtrip
policy
and
he
could
have
done
it
at
his
destination.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
this
happened
to
be
a
non-stop
flight
but
i
have
to
certainly
--
you
could
try
it
anyway.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
right,
right,
but
there
is.
that
is
only
significant
aspect
of
ownership
in
this
policy,
is
this
power
to
change
the
beneficiary
and
it
just
isn't
possible
to
overlook
it.
that's
all
you've
got
and
it
clearly
was
in
the
decedent.
what
we
have
considered
this
business
of
impossibility
at
the
time
he
was
on
that
airplane
he
couldn't
have
changed
the
beneficiary
on
his
own
ordinary
life
insurance
policy
either,
but
i
don't
suppose
that,
that
would
be
--
would
be
taken
seriously
as
an
argument
for
not
including
his
own
life
insurance
just
because
the
minute
he
left
he
was
in
the
airplane
where
he
couldn't
contact
the
company.
so
as
judge
brown
points
out
it
goes
too
far.
and
we
have
cases
in
the
power
of
appointment
area
which
the
heard
case
is
an
example
which
points
out
it
isn't
the
actual
likelihood
of
exercise
of
the
existence
of
the
power
which
has
to
be
controlling
for
tax
purposes.
some
comment
is
made
that
this
is
pure
broiler
plate,
but
we
note
from
the
record
at
page
28
that
the
company
involved
has
considered
this
problem
a
little
bit
more
and
now
makes
available
forms
for
assignment
which
presumably
would
permit
an
insured
to
assign
it.
but
unfortunately
for
the
decedent
here
those
forms
were
not
available
at
that
time
and
we
think
that
closer
recognition,
there
is
a
right
which
has
to
be
dealt
with
here.
and
just
lastly
on
the
incidence
of
ownership
we
would
say
that
you
can't
overlook
the
accidental
portion
here
for
loss
of
limb
and
sight
and
eye.
that's
a
benefit
which
is
payable.
it
is
payable
to
the
insured
if
that
had
been
the
result
of
the
accident
and
that
in
itself
may
have
been
incident
of
ownership.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
i
would
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
it
would.
i
fear
that
i've
expressed
mr.
justice
white
is
that
it
would
go
further,
it
would
also
settle
adversely
such
things
as
term
insurance,
double
indemnity
portions
of
regular
life
insurance
if
at
least
have
done
in
the
terms
which
the
third
circuit
has
stated.
there's
nothing
magic
to
the
airplane
nature,
just
except
the
fact
that
it
highlights
the
tangency
of
the
policy.
it
last
only
a
short
time,
it
covers
only
a
very
small
likelihood
of
death
and
as
the
court
can
recognize,
it's
not
a
very
valuable
piece
of
paper
spoken
of
generally
just
in
the
rare
case
of
an
airplane
accident
suddenly
assumes
this,
but
we
think
the
rules
set
down
by
congress
speak
to
this
policy
as
to
all
others.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
mr.
jones.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
goldberg
the
provision
on
the
indemnity
for
loss
of
life
the
principal
sum
is
at
page
40
of
the
record.
in
working
on
this
case
i've
been
a
little
concerned
on
the
fragmentation
of
the
policy
throughout
the
record
here.
i
wonder
if
the
court
would
like
to
have
submitted
to
a,
two
complete
copies
of
the
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
i
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute.
we
wish
to
arrange
that.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
not,
that
this
thing
had
resulted
at
the
airport
and
the
only
other
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no
it
would
not.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right,
in
the
manner
specified.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
alighting
from
an
aircraft,
being
hit
by
another
aircraft.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
cover
the
situation
if
another
passenger
shoots
him
or
not,
i
just
don't
know
that.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
clearly
it
would
not
cover
that.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
they
will
be
complete
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
that.
the
only
other
point
that
i'd
make
is
that
in
emphasizing
the
legislative
history
here
i
think
that
the
respondent
has
shown
a
misunderstanding
of
what
the
estate
tax
is.
the
estate
tax
is
a
revenue
raising
measure
which
produces
approximately
$2
billion
a
year
in
the
federal
budget
which
is
an
appreciable
portion
of
it.
and
i
think
this
difference
between
our
two
sides
is
shown
by
the
quotation
from
his
brief
on
page
14,
where
he
describes
the
purpose
of
the
estate
tax
to
be
the
prevention
of
accumulated
wealth
being
passed
on
undiminished
from
generation
to
generation,
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
history
of
the
same
provisions
of
the
estate
tax
which
has
been
cited
to
this
court
for
other
purposes
will
show
that
there's
an
important
revenue
measure
and
that
this
is
a
category
of
transmission
of
death
which
is
within
the
statute.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
it
would
turn
on
whether
the
company
would
accept
that.
the
company
could
prove
that
it
would
not
accept
it
then
it's
not
an
effective
assignment.
my
guess
is
that
if
that
had
been
done
it
would
be
very
hard
for
the
company
under
the
laws
of
any
state
to
resist
that
and
in
fact
if
people
do,
do
that
to
those
policies
even
though
it
says
that
nobody
can
vary
the
terms
that
some
people
aware
of
the
estate
tax
consequences
have
so
written.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
if
that
would
be
binding
on
the
insurance
company
then
it
would
take
it
out
of
the
insured's
estate.
if
it
would
not
be
binding
then
it's
an
ineffective
designate.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
a
simpler
way
is
for
the
insurance
company
to
put
a
form
out
there
and
just
say
check
here
if
you
wish
to
assign
the
rights
of
the
beneficiary
which
is
being
done.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
they
do
now
have
such
a
form,
they
did
not.
thank
you.
