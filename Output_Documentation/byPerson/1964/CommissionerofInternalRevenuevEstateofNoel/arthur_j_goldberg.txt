and
i
don't
find
any
reference
to
death
at
all
in
these
policies,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
these
policies
basically
only
cover
injury.
why
are
we
discussing
this
as
a
death
policy
at
all?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
know
a
death
occurred
but
the
policy
on
its
face
only
purports
to
cover
indemnity
for
injury,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
there
are
policies
that
talk
about
accidental
death,
we
can
have
some
of
those
policies,
but
both
of
these
policies,
i
looked
at
them
again
and
say
that
they
are
for
injury
accidental,
bodily
injury.
now
they
do
have
this
amount
and
we
can
commonly,
i
know
i've
taken
out
policy
frequently,
i
commonly
assume
what
you
have
said,
could
you
not
make
an
argument
that
this
is
not
life
insurance
at
all,
this
is
an
injury
policy?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
you
did
not
distinguish,
that's
why
when
mr.
douglas
asked
you,
do
you
distinguish
between
the
policy
which
falls
for
reimbursement
for
injury
and
the
policy
which
for
death,
you
said
you
didn't
distinguish.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
know,
you
have
been
arguing
otherwise.
you
have
said
that
the
incident,
certainty
is
so
remote
that
it's
different
from
other
life
policies
which
my
brother
white
has
just
been
asking
you
about,
but
it's
quite
a
different
argument
it
seemed
to
me
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
life
insurance
policy
at
all.
what
you
are
covering
for
is
injury
to
the
body
and
so
it
may
have
resulted
in
death,
but
if
no
death
had
resulted
here,
if
the
man
had
been
injured,
or
re-injured
there
could
have
been
a
recovery
under
this
policy.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
lost
arm,
lost
a
leg
and
bodily
injured,
he
could
have
recovered
under
this
policy.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
policy
could
be
redefined
