justice

finding
that
she
had
paid
the
premium?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
what
significance
would
this
be?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
did
not
have
any
incidence
of
ownership
it
might
be
of
significance,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
no
present
significance.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
he
could
do
it
with
the
roundtrip
policy,
i
suppose
he
could
do
it
at
his
one
way
destination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
he
arrived
there.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
kind
of
a
policy
that
the
people
sometimes
take
out
during
the
--
when
they
borrow
money
which
is
a
short-term
life
insurance
policy
to
be
sure
that
that
will
be
paid
if
they
die
during
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
now
there
is
--
where
would
you
think
that
would
fall
if
it's
some
kind
of
a
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
statute
doesn't
say
life
insurance.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you
my
question,
because
that
kind
of
an
insurance
is
not
covered
by
the
congressional
intent,
is
it?
very
short-term
life
insurance,
that's
not
covered
by
the
congressional
intent
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
kind
of
life
--
that
kind
of
insurance
on
a
person's
life
is
not
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
and
it
uses
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
it's
30
days
or
60
days
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
but
without
cash
value,
very
little
with
to
do
with
the
policy
which
you
say
congress
had
before
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
an
annual
policy
in
this
case.
there
is
the
depletion
on
that
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
happened
with
the
plan?
did
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
have
sued
for
a
refund.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter,
at
least
so
far
while
you
say
you
would
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
an
annual
policy,
the
fact
is
at
least
so
far
you
haven't
made,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
would
be
different
if
this
was
just
a
straight
payment
for
death
rather
than
an
injury,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
has
to
mr.
ball,
both
you
and
my
brother
white
have
gotten
away
a
little
bit
in
your
arguments.
you're
not
talking
about
the
expectancy
of
death.
the
point
you've
been
making
is
the
certainty
of
death,
that
a
life
insurance
policy
and
everybody
so
far,
every
human
being
dies,
presumably
anyone
is
going
to
continue
to
die
someday,
that's
your
point.
justice
potter
stewart
both
the
term
policy
and
an
accident
insurance
policy
cover,
insure
against
death
but
--
and
in
neither
one
is
there
any
certainty
of
death.
that
the
odds
are
much
longer
in
the
policy
involved
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
think
mr.
ball
that
the
debit
for
which
my
brother
goldberg
refers,
i
guess
the
excerpts
comment
that,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
the
life
policy,
this
did
pay,
each
one
of
these
paid
$62,500
in
the
event
of
death
on
this
roundtrip
airplane.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
addition
it
paid
specific
sums
for
loss
of
an
arm
or
a
leg
or
eye
or
an
ear.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
were
no
death
that
paid
to
be
insured
himself
for
the
loss
of
a
hand,
as
i
say,
or
an
eye
or
an
ear,
but
if
he
died
on
this
roundtrip
on
a
flight
it
paid,
each
one
of
these
paid
$62,500
to
the
beneficiary,
i.
e.,
the
widow.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jones
this
policy
would
not
have
covered
had
the
passenger
died
of
old
age
on
the
trip
and
the
airplane
had
landed
safely.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
only
for
accidental
death.
justice
potter
stewart
what
manner
specified?
justice
potter
stewart
either
in
flight
or
you
know
the
matter
specified
in
connection
with
this
airline?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
cover
death
from
natural
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
trip?
