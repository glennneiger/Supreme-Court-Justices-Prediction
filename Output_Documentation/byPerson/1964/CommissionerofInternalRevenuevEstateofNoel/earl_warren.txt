of

deceased,
et

mr.
jones.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
is
a
legislative
history
on
that
statute
mr.
jones
that's
convincing
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ball.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
this
was
an
annual
policy
instead
of
the
single
roundtrip
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
answer,
i
didn't
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
were
to
prevail
in
this
case,
would
that
money
be
subject
to
taxation
by
anyone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
cannot
constitutionally
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
double
indemnity
clause
in
a
life
insurance
policy?
is
that
somewhat
similar
to
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ball
i
--
bearing
on
the
question
as
to
purpose
and
intention
of
congress
i
understood
from
mr.
jones
that
the
government
has
been
collecting
taxes
on
such
moneys
since
the
ackerman
case
in
1929.
and
congress
has
changed
the
law
several
times
and
since
then
hasn't
done
anything
about
this
and
apparently
no
one
has
challenged
it
seriously
in
the
courts
until
this
time,
and
i
wonder
if
we
could
assume
that
congress
was
to
overlook
the
source
of
income
of
this
kind
or
would
permit
the
bureau
to
collect
taxes
of
this
kind,
but
it
was
such
an
important
thing
in
the
life
of
the
nation.
and
i
say
that
because
i
just
read
in
the
newspaper
a
few
days
ago
that
last
year
there
were
47,000
people
killed
in
automobile
accidents
alone
in
this
country
and
certainly
there
must
have
been
a
great
number
of
those
people
who
were
protected
by
this
kind
of
insurance
and
i
wonder
if
congress
had
intended
what
you
urge
upon
us,
if
they
would
not
have
changed
that
law
somewhere
along
the
line
and
the
government
has
been
collecting
it
all
these
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
did
the
government
collect
the
taxes
during
that
period,
all
these
periods
since
ackerman,
on
the
theory
of
the
government
is
now
arguing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whatever
the
taxes
were
they
were
collecting
them
on
this
theory,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
you
have
a
sentence
or
two
to
complete
your
thought,
go
ahead,
but
if
you
want
to
extend
time
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
do
that?
