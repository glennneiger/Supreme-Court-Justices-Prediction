mr.
jones
i
gather
this
case
really
bears
on
all
accident
policies
not
just
aircraft
accident
policies,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
either
way
it's
decided
it
would
have
a
--
rather
it
would
settle
a
lot
of
other
things
too.

but
in
common
insurance
there
is
no
expectancy
of
death
within
term,
the
credible
life
insurance
there's
no
expectancy
of
death
within
the
period
of
the
said
obligation.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
year-to-year
term
policy,
it
may
or
it
may
not
happen,
just
like
in
an
accident
policy
which
includes
death.
the
death
proceeds
may
or
may
not
be
paid.
justice
byron

because
death
may
or
may
not
happen
as
result
of
an
accident.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
i
just
buy
a
policy,
a
life
insurance
policy
for
a
year
to
satisfy
my
creditors.
now
the
expectancy
if
i
die
within
a
year
are
poles
apart,
then
the
certainty
of
death
that
everybody
has.
justice
byron
r.

still
there,
and
also
there's,
i
suppose
you
could
figure
mathematically
that
what
the
chances
are
of
dying
accidentally
within
the
year.
