wasn't
there
however
a
different
theory
advanced
for
excluding
the
other
accident
policy,
and
that
was
that
the
ownership
wasn't
transferred
to
the
wife,
whereas
here
the
theory
was
that
the
ownership
was?
justice

c.

yes,
i
understand.
justice

c.

your
argument
however
would
apply
to
any
accidental
death
policy,
whether
it's
the
automobile
or
airplane
or
anything
else,
would
it
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
there
we
have
a
very
substantial
incident,
while
it's
true
with
what
you've
said
about
airplanes
is
true,
accidental
death
by
automobile
has
assumed
the
largest
proportion
in
the
country.
