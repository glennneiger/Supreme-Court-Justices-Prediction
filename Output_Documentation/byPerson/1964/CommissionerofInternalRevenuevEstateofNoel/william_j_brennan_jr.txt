that
would
be
dangerous
to
say
if
there's
almost
a
certainty
of
no
death.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
that
form
of
life
insurance
is
taken
out,
but
the
fact
that
they've
said
it.
for
example
the
ordinary
tuition
plan
for
instance,
i
expect
many
received,
which
provides
that
if
you
don't
pay
tuition
plan
over
the
course
of
the
full
year
because
of
death
that
the
obligation
is
distinguished,
but
the
bank
is
paid
by
the
insurance
company.
what's
the
economic
interest
in
say
passing,
if
it
makes
that
passing?
i
think
you
answered
to
justice
stewart
earlier
that,
that
would
be
passable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
term?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
your
decedent
had
one
of
these
tuition
plan
policies,
are
you
suggesting
that
while
there
accident
policies
is
not
being
suitable,
whatever
is
balance
owing
to
the
extent
they
are
still
owing
tuition,
to
that
extent
this
would
be
included,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
this
certainly
insures
against
death
through
a
accident,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jones,
suppose
in
addition
to
naming
the
beneficiary
the
insured
has
written
across
the
face
of
the
policy
“i
hereby
assign
all
my
right,
title
in
this
policy
to
the
beneficiary”
change
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
would
be
the
estate
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
simpler
way,
isn't
it?
