mr.

bernnan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
what
you
said
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
you
didn't
produce
the
agent?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
do
i
get
you
mr.
terris
that
in
this
case,
you
didn't
need
this
affidavit
to
get
your
order.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
i
mean
what
--
and
this
--
well
as
i
understand
it
your
intermediate
position
if
that's
what
it
is,
that
your
ability
to
use
the
affidavit
or
not
as
the
commissioner
decides.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
i
wonder
if
you're
not
encouraging
it
in
light
of
your
position
in
thinking
that
you
have
to
have
even
an
affidavit.
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
know,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
you're
encouraging
the
litigation
by
--
if
you're
right
that
you
don't
need
an
affidavit,
you
don't
need
anything.
mr.
justice
bernnan
you're
entitled
to
an
order
just
by
going
in
and
asking
for
it
then
why
do
you
complicate
the
matter
by
coming
in
with
affidavits
which
then
create
all
the
litigation
i
don't
understand?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
when
you
asked
of
me
earlier
mr.
terris
that
this
agent
in
this
case
was
available
to
mr.
segal?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
i
understood
you
mean,
perhaps
i
got
it
incorrectly.
i
understood
you
to
mean
that
if
he
wanted
the
agent,
he'd
have
to
produce
him
as
his
witness.
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
what
you
meant?
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
and
i
going
to
produce
him
for
cross-examination
on
the
affidavit.
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
--
and
would
have
contested
an
application
to
do
some
or
did
you
--
in
fact
you
had?
mr.
justice
bernnan
as
his
witness?
mr.
justice
bernnan
not
available
for
cross-examination
as
yours,
is
that
right?
