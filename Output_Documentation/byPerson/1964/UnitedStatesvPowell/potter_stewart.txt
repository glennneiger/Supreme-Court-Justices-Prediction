justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
--
the
statute
that
is
7604
(a)
makes
this
something
quite
different
from
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
it
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
district
courts
to
issue
appropriate
process,
it
didn't
say
they
shall
do
it
automatically
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
according
to
court
and
that's
the
point
your
making
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
presumably
before
it
issues
something
is
going
to
have
a
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
are
the
issues
to
be
heard.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
case
is
that
mr.
segal?
justice
potter
stewart
one
thing
i
don't
quite
get
about
your
position
mr.
terris
is
this.
you
in
this
case
perhaps
or
maybe
it
was
in
the
previous
case
you've
conceded
that
you
--
that
the
hearing,
that
when
you
go
to
the
district
court
there
is
a
hearing,
haven't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
implicit
in
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
hearing
is
the
right
to
cross-examine.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
and
in
this
case
you
wouldn't
even
put
your
witness
on.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
don't
think
that
i
--
we
need
to
--
i
think
to
use
the
phrase
probable
cause
maybe
unfortunate
because
that
brings
all
sorts
of
fourth
amendment
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
position
that
a
self-serving
affidavit
is
sufficient,
that
you
--
that
you're
under
no
duty
to
put
your
witness
on
even
to
--
even
for
the
purpose
of
his
bidding
cross-examiner
as
to
whether
not
he
is
telling
the
truth
as
to
the
fact
that
he
suspects
fraud,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
talking
about
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
first
three
years
you
don't
--
you're
not
suggesting
there
is
any
really
serious
problem
for
the
government
because
you
--
the
statute
says
that
you
can
summon
anybody's
books
and
records
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
any
return.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
you
have
to
prove
--
you're
forgetting
about
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
simply
suggesting
that
if
you're
right,
if
your
are
right
about
the
period
after
three
years
you're
certainly
right
about
the
period
before
three
years.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
if
it
--
and
it
doesn't
apply
to
all
the
first
examinations
and
doesn't
apply
all
the
second
examinations
once
you
get
the
certificate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
take
them
if
you
will,
said
this
of
course
a
court
is
always
free
to
ensure
and
investigate
any
question
of
bad
faith
and
yeah
as
i
understand
it,
you
did
not
quarrel
at
all?
