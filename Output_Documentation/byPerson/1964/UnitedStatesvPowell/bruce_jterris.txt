mr.
bruce
j.terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
indicated
before,
this
case
involves
basically
the
same
issues
as
are
involved
in
the
ryan
case.
the
only
real
difference
being
that
here
there
were
second
examinations
of
the
taxpayer's
records
but
notices
under
section
7605
(b)
had
been
sent.
i'll
give
the
facts
briefly.
respondent
powell
is
the
president
of
respondent
william
penn
laundry
company
which
is
the
taxpayer,
which
is
involved.
mr.
powell
received
an
internal
revenue
service
summons,
give
testimony,
produced
books
and
records
of
the
company
relating
to
its
tax
liability,
the
company's
tax
liability
for
the
years
1958
and
1959.
the
time
the
summons
was
issued,
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
had
elapsed
although
not
the
six-year.
as
i've
indicated
since
they're
already
been
prior
examination
of
the
taxpayer's
books,
the
statutory
notice
was
sent
by
the
regional
commissioner.
at
the
administrative
hearing,
mr.
powell
refused
to
produce
the
books
on
the
advice
of
counsel
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
made
no
showing
of
fraud.
in
proceeding
to
enforce
the
summons
in
the
district
court,
the
government
introduced
the
affidavit,
not
the
testimony,
the
affidavit
of
an
agent
stating
that
on
the
basis
of
investigation,
he
had
reason
to
suspect
that
the
taxpayer
has
filed
false
and
fraudulent
returns
for
the
years
1958
and
1959
with
intent
to
evade
its
taxes
and
that
the
taxpayer
had
attempted
to
evade
these
taxes
and
i
quote,
“by
overstating
the
amount
of
purchases
made
which
in
turn
were
used
as
expenses,
so
as
to
fraudulently
understate
the
amount
of
taxable
income.”
the
district
court,
while
indicating
doubt
as
to
the
legal
rights
of
the
respective
parties,
apparently
compromised,
and
allowed
the
revenue
agents
one
hour
to
examine
the
taxpayer's
books.
the
third
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
the
summons
was
invalid
on
the
ground
that
after
the
running
of
three-year
statute
of
limitations
a
reexamination
of
the
taxpayer's
records
is
unnecessary
under
section
7605
(b),
unless
the
commissioner
shows
that
he
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
taxpayer
has
committed
fraud.
therefore,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
same
as
the
issue
in
the
ryan
case.
whether
the
government
must
show
probable
cause
or
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
which
is
the
equivalent
before
it
can
obtain
judicial
enforcement
of
the
summons
which
is
as
part
of
investigation
after
the
three
years
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
now,
as
i've
indicated
the
basic
arguments
of
the
government
are
the
same
as
in
the
ryan
case
and
i
will
not
repeat
them.
i
would
however,
like
to
turn
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
taxpayer's
argument
or
the
respondent's
argument.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right.
the
reason
i
say
that
this
makes
no
difference
is
once
you've
satisfied
that
part
assuming
there
are
two
parts
to
the
statute
of
7605
(b).
once
you've
satisfied
the
second
part
and
then
your
back
under
the
first
part
again.
and
so
that
is
the
issue,
whether
the
first
part
of
section
7605
(b)
can
be
read
separately
from
the
second
part
and
if
read
separately,
means
that
the
government
must
show
probable
cause
after
the
three-year
period
has
run.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
possible
sources.
one
is
the
fourth
amendment,
oklahoma
press
--
the
oklahoma
press
case
indicates
that
when
a
subpoena
is
sufficiently
burdensome,
sufficiently
broad,
and
i
assume
it
doesn't
say
this,
is
issued
in
bad
faith,
it
would
be
considered
unreasonable.
it
might
be
considered
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
there's
another
possible
ground
that
is
that
the
government
is
asking
the
courts
to
enforce
process
and
if
indeed
the
process
is
based
on
bad
faith,
i
think
that
there
would
be
substantial
argument
that
the
courts
need
not
enforce
the
summons.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
i
assume
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
i
think
that's
where
the
--
they
said
the
one
possible
source,
the
others
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right
and
reisman
and
caplin
states
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
under
this
section.
i
think
the
government
agreed
reisman
and
caplin
that
that
was
so
and
we
don't
contest
that.
the
question
is
whether
the
substantive
rights
of
the
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right.
there's
no
question
about
whether
there's
a
hearing
because
as
a
hearing
doesn't
mean
any
conceivable
standard
or
right
automatically
comes
into
play.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right,
we
don't
know
that
he
did.
in
fact,
depending
on
what
the
underlying
facts
are,
we
may
only
have
this
–
an
inkling
that
this
is
what
occur.
and
putting
into
words
of
oklahoma
press,
we
need
this
information
not
to
prove
that
a
violation
of
the
law
has
occurred
but
to
find
out
whether
there
has
been
any
kind
of
violation.
we
turn
into
the
practical
consequences
of
what
respondent's
argument
in
this
case.
if
it's
the
first
circuit
holds
and
respondents
apparently
agree
with
this,
the
standard
of
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment
applies,
i
think
it
doesn't
require
much
stretch
of
imagination
to
see
how
seriously
this
would
interfere
with
investigations
for
fraud.
it
would
mean
that
the
service
we
have
far
toward
proving
fraud
before
it
could
investigate
fraud.
that
even
if
a
lesser
standard
were
imposed,
the
service
would
be
prevented
from
pursuing
investigations
where
they
had
some
reason
to
suspect
that
fraud
had
been
committed
but
they
had
no
more.
we
think
that
under
a
self
assessment
system
of
--
for
the
tax
laws
that
it's
essential
that
the
government,
and
apparently,
congress
agreed,
should
have
broad
powers
to
investigate.
and
when
fraud
has
been
committed,
the
investigation
of
course,
is
particularly
difficult
because
it's
been
covered
up
in
most
instances.
now,
another
practical
consequence
is
the
petitioner's
argument,
as
i've
indicated
before,
is
really
asking
for
miniature
trial.
this
isn't
like
a
search
or
an
arrest
warrant,
he
wants
a
trial,
he's
got
counsel
there,
he
wants
to
cross-examine
witness,
he
wants
to
put
on
his
own
witnesses.
so
we're
going
to
have
a
trial
before
we
can
investigate.
not
only
we're
going
to
have
a
trial
but
we're
going
to
have
an
appeal
and
presumably
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
look
at
the
government's
evidence.
in
fact
of
course,
that's
what
--
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
and
has
happened
in
the
first
circuit
cases.
and
ultimately,
there
could
be
a
petition
to
this
court.
all
this
time,
investigation
will
then
stop
because
usually
the
crux
of
the
investigation,
before
you
hardly
get
off
the
ground
is
a
look
at
the
taxpayer's
records.
and
as
i've
indicated
before,
it's
virtually
certain
that
if
this
is
allowed,
there's
going
to
be
a
great
increase
in
amount
of
litigation
as
everybody
is
going
to
be
able
to
block
investigations
for
two
or
three
years
as
these
have
been
stopped.
merely,
i'm
putting
the
government
to
its
proof
and
that
litigating
whether
this
proof
is
sufficient.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
a
heavy
burden
on
the
surface
and
also
on
the
courts.
i
like
you
to
turn
quite
briefly
to
an
argument
which
is
made
in
this
case
and
was
not
made
in
the
ryan
case.
respondents
argue
that
four
early
cases
required
proof
of
probable
cause
for
enforcement
of
the
surface
summons
after
the
statute
of
limitation
had
run
and
that
the
reenactment
by
congress
of
section
7605
(b)
constitute
a
congressional
adoption
of
the
interpretation
of
these
cases.
however,
it's
interesting
that
there
was
at
least
one
other
case
that
even
if
there
was
--
at
approximately
the
same
time
as
these
early
cases
which
held
to
the
contrary,
so
there
was
some
split
of
authority
even
then.
but
even
decided
from
that,
this
rule
of
congressional
adoption,
the
judicial
decisions
is
premised
on
the
theory
that
congress
either
knew
of
the
decisions
or
at
least
could
be
assumed
to
know
of
them
such
as
decisions
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
we
can
realistically
assume
without
any
indication
of
legislative
history
that
four
lower
court
decisions
were
known
to
the
congress
when
it
embodied
the
predecessor
of
section
7605
(b)
in
the
1939
and
1954
code
among
the
thousands
of
sections
which
were
enacted.
now,
i
like
to
turn
to
the
government's
alternative
theory
which
i've
indicated
before
in
the
ryan
case
and
it
also
exists
in
this
case,
and
that
is
even
if
the
government
does
have
to
say
something
about
what
its
suspicion,
that
it
has
suspicion
or
even
it
has
to
go
beyond
that
and
has
to
make
some
kind
of
a
statement
of
what
its
suspicion
is
grounded
upon,
that
there
was
sufficient
indication
in
this
case
to
satisfy
that
kind
of
a
test.
here,
as
i've
indicated,
the
affidavit
of
the
agent
says
it
upon
investigation,
he
suspects
that
there
was
fraud
and
he
gives
inconclusive
returns
that
it's
true,
that
he
gives
conclusory
terms
the
basis
for
a
suspicion.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
well,
that's
--
that's
somewhat
complicated
your
honor.
one
problem
is
that
there
seems
to
be
a
split
on
authority
and
whether
section
7605
(b)
applies
to
third
parties
at
all.
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
third
parties
at
all,
second
circuit
seems
to
indicate
it
doesn't
apply
to
third
parties
at
all.
that
would
mean
that
we
could
presumably
go
to
the
bank
or
anything
like
that
with
just
the
showing
the
relevancy
and
materiality
and
that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
bruce
j.terris
that's
right,
7602
allows
us
to
get
a
third
party.
that
is
held
and
it
seems
to
be
accepted.
now,
if
section
7605
doesn't
--
doesn't
apply
to
third
parties
then
as
i
say
7602
applies
alone
in
and
only
relevancy
and
materiality
be
shown.
if
7605
(b)
does
apply
to
third
parties,
then
presumably
we
have
to
make
the
same
kind
of
showing
about
our
suspicion
of
fraud
with
relation
to
the
taxpayer
before
we
can
get
those
records.
i
think
that
the
first
circuit's
view,
there's
no
indication
that's
restricted
just
to
the
taxpayer
and
that
i
would
assume
that
it's
view
is
that
we're
similarly
limited
as
to
third
parties.
