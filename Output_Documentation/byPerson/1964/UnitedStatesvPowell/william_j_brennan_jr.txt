justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
terris,
turning
to
this
case
and
mr.
tiberino
or
whatever
his
name
is,
affidavit,
do
i
get
your
position
to
be
something
like
this?
what
you
said
is
he
has
reason
to
suspect
that
this
was
done
by
overstating
the
amount
of
purchase.
they're
not
claiming
that
in
fact
he
did
that
to
get
confirmation
of
the
suspicion
you
have
to
look
at
the
books
that
may
develop.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
really
did
not
overstate
the
amount
of
purchases
and
therefore,
that
you
have
no
case,
is
that
it?
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
government
ought
not
be
required
to
indicate
that
indeed
he
had
overstated
the
amount
of
purchase,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
segal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
the
standard
that
you
suggest
has
been
applied
and
not
continue
to
be
applied,
also
be
applicable
on
situation
like
the
ryan
case,
previous
case,
are
you
arguing
this
solely
as
regard
the
reexamination
of
records
already?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understood
you,
given
the
--
well,
at
least,
i
think
what
you've
been
arguing
isn't
that
mr.
segal
is
the
department
itself
had
given
that
word,
the
connotation
of
acquiring
it
to
show
a
reasonable
something
like
this,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
hear
you
correctly
as
saying
the
department
itself
has
at
least
adopted
the
first
thing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
namely
the
reasonable
basis
for
suspecting
fraud?
