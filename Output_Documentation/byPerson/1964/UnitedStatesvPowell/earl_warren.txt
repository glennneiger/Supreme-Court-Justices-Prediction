mr.
segal,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
so,
but
it
means
summary
docketed
rule
mr.
segal
and
if
you're
really
tense
for
time
you
may
take
that
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
want
it
to
be
a
custom
just
because
we
did
it
the
other
day
with
someone,
i
wish
you
wouldn't
look
at
it
from
that
point.
chief
justice

warren

different

normally
we
expect
a
man
to
finish

his
time.
chief

warren
and
this
has
a
single
issue
and
it
can
well
be
argued
in
30
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
terris.
