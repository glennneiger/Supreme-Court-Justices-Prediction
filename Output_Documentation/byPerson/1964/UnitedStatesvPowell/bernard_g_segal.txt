mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
has
asked
about
what
would
be
the
practical
result,
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
in
the
form
of
an
exclamation
that
would
be
quite
a
trial
and
the
questions
mr.
justice
white
asked
called
for
the
application
here
of
mr.
justice
holmes'
classic
comment
that
a
page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
of
logic.
because
history
shows
that
none
of
these
theories
would
be
realized
indeed
none
of
them
has
been
realized.
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
issue
has
been
litigated
in
the
courts
nor
is
it
the
first
time
that
the
governments
have
been
called
upon
to
take
a
position.
history
records
that
the
government
has
had
a
remarkable
amount
of
success
without
taking
the
position
that
it
takes
here.
the
government
today
argues
what
it
calls
an
alternative
theory.
well,
first
i
say
your
honors
that
that
alternative
theory
is
not
available
to
it,
under
the
rules
of
this
court.
it
is
not
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
in
the
lower
court
when
the
judge
insisted
on
the
witness
appearing,
the
government
refuse
to
permit
them
on
the
ground
of
testimony
could
mean
nothing.
they
were
taking
the
flock
position
that
once
the
regional
commissioner
made
a
determination
that
they
should
be
an
examination,
no
testimony,
no
showing
of
any
kind
was
required.
that
if
it
please
the
court,
is
the
issue
in
this
court
and
that
is
the
issue
to
which
i
intend
to
address
myself
unless
the
court
requests
otherwise.
now,
as
to
the
history,
first
let
me
note
that
these
are
as
has
been
indicated
old
statutes.
the
particular
section
has
been
so
much
in
discussion
here
with
the
last
of
the
four
that
have
been
under
questioning
and
answer.
7605
(b)
was
adopted
in
1921
the
others
are
all
earlier
and
i
need
not
labor
the
point
that
fraud
cases
have
arisen
since
1921
many,
many
times.
now,
during
most
of
those
years
that
the
statutes
have
been
effective,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
government
took
the
precise
position
in
court
that
we
are
taking
today.
namely,
that
if
it
wishes
to
lift
the
bar
of
6501,
if
a
taxpayer
says,
you
have
no
right
to
assess
therefore
there's
no
statutory
purpose
to
be
served
that
the
government
has
then
put
to
what,
to
a
burden
of
showing
some
reasonable
basis
not
a
proof
of
fraud,
that
was
early
rejected
by
the
courts.
some
reasonable
basis
were
singling
out
this
taxpayer
not
as
before
the
three
years
just
for
a
routine
examination
but
for
the
owners,
the
owners
to
his
employees,
the
owners
to
his
neighbors,
the
owners
to
his
business
associates,
the
owners
to
his
bankers
of
being
under
the
suspicion
of
fraud.
and
very
early,
the
commissioner
took
the
position,
“sure
we
recognize
that
we've
got
to
show
a
reasonable
basis.”
and
so,
if
the
court
please,
in
1942
in
martin
against
chandis,
the
court
expressly
said
that,
“we
have
here
two
viewpoints,
we
have
the
viewpoint
of
the
taxpayer
who
says
the
bar
cannot
be
lifted
unless
and
until
the
government
shows
fraud”
and
said
the
court,
“we
now
have
the
viewpoint
of
the
government”
who
says,
“no,
we
merely
have
to
show
a
reasonable
basis
for
suspecting
that
fraud
exists.”
i
may
say
to
your
honor
that
they
have
not
faired
badly.
there
are
eight
cases
in
which
they
produce
testimony
and
seven
of
them
in
which
they
produce
even
live
witnesses,
in
seven
of
them
the
court
of
appeals
have
granted
the
request
and
then
the
one
which
was
not
granted
o'connor
against
o'connell,
the
man
appeared
simply
to
say,
“i
won't
give
testimony.”
so
that
in
seven
out
of
the
seven
cases,
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
took
the
position
i've
enunciated
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
it
has
met
with
success.
now,
what
about
these
early
cases
that
my
friend
referred
to?
well,
first
was
the
andrews
case
in
1937.
in
that
case
judge
chesnut
in
the
district
of
maryland
rejected
the
taxpayer's
assertion
that
all
that
had
to
be
--
that
he
had
to
prove
fraud,
and
accepted
the
requirement
that
the
government
had
to
prove
a
reasonable
ground
for
suspecting
fraud.
the
--
judge
chesnut
felt
he
was
satisfied
what
the
government
was
requested
of
that
day.
i've
already
told
your
honors
about
martin
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
the
court
expressly
said
we're
not
going
to
pass
even
on
whether
government's
contention
is
correct.
we
accept
its
contention
and
we
find
it
has
here
met
the
burden
and
it
met
the
burden
by
simply
demonstrating
that
there
was
some
reasonable
ground
to
ask
that
the
bar
of
the
statute
be
lifted.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
martin
against
chandis,
c-h-a-n-d-i-s.
and
so
the
law
stood,
if
it
please
the
court,
brooklyn
pawnbrokers
and
so
on
for
many
years.
more
laterally,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
begun
to
suggest,
as
it
did
in
the
second
circuit,
and
met
a
sympathetic
response
that
it
now
has
to
show
nothing.
no
change
in
the
statute
to
explain
that
but
that
no
longer
does
it
have
to
show
anything.
it
merely
has
to
say
the
regional
commissioner
has
determined
that
an
examination
should
be
made,
period
and
then
the
man
is
subjected
to
a
fraud
examination,
make
no
mistake
about
it,
it's
labeled
a
fraud
examination
and
it
is
a
fraud
examination
and
everybody
so
understands
it,
was
told
about
it.
now,
what
have
the
circuits
done
about
that?
well,
the
first
and
third
circuit
has
said,
“no,
we're
going
to
hold
you
to
test
you
yourself
established
of
just
showing
a
reasonable
basis.
in
this
case
your
honor,
my
friend
is
not
correct
in
saying
that
we
ask
for
probable
cause.
we
said
to
the
tax
examiner,
“look,
you'll
have
a
thorough
examination
here.
you've
had
a
thorough
one.
you've
had
an
assessment.
you've
been
through
all
these
books
with
a
taxpayer
who
owned
the
business
and
who
was
the
president.
now,
he
is
dead
and
we
want
to
know
with
him
not
here.
and
with
no
one
alive
knowing
anything
about
this,
give
us
some
indication”
and
those
were
the
exact
words,
“some
indication
of
what
you
have
in
mind”
and
the
answer
to
that
was
the
hearing
is
closed.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
young
man
who
happen
to
be
a
ward
of
mine
and
died
within
five
minutes
after
he
seem
to
be
perfectly
well,
we
were
interested
in
protecting
his
honor
against
the
fraud
examination.
and
if
the
commissioner
had
shown
us
“some
indication”
he
have
had
100%
cooperation
and
i'm
here
today
because
not
that
he
wanted
to
show
anything,
he
wanted
to
show
nothing.
the
affidavit
as
judge
hastie
found
is
just
a
broad
generality
that
means
nothing.
it
isn't
even
consistent
with
itself
because
purchases
can't
be
an
expense
by
any
system
of
accounting,
but
i
don't
address
myself
to
that
because
that's
not
in
this
court.
now
going
to
the
ninth
circuit,
there
we
have
a
somewhat
different
standard
but
on
very
much
the
same
line.
in
that
case,
that
the
former
clerk
of
this
court,
judge
browning
said,
“i
don't
quite
understand
what
probable
cause
means?”
he
said,
“i
want
to
be
shown
that
the
commissioner
had
some
basis
for
a
rational
judgment
that
fraud
might
exist
in
this
case,
a
rational
judgment.”
i'd
accept
that
test,
your
honors.
i'd
accept
any
showing
that
would
persuade
a
reasonable
man
that
it
wasn't
just
a
completely
arbitrary
thing
that
they
desired
to
do”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
de
masters
against
arend,
mr.
justice
white,
decided
just
last
year
by
unanimous
court,
opinion
written
by
judge
browning.
judge
browning
said
in
that
case
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
it
is.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
de
masters,
capital
d-e,
capital
m-a-s-t-e-r-s.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
in
that
case,
judge
browning
said,
“that
once
a
statute
was
pleaded,
the
burden
shifted
to
the
government
and
he
pointed
out
it
wasn't
a
very
serious
shift.”
it
simply
said
to
the
government
if
you
want
to
come
in
and
connote
fraud
or
suspicion
of
fraud
to
this
man,
we
won't
let
you
do
it
until
you
tell
us
something
about
it.
now,
if
they
have
nothing
at
all
your
honors,
they
ought
not
to
be
in
there.
if
they
have
anything
at
all
history
records
that
the
district
judges
have
been
more
than
sympathetic
with
the
problems
of
the
taxpayer
--
of
the
tax
collector
but
they
haven't
been
completely
disregardful
of
the
rights
of
the
taxpayer.
in
the
brooklyn
pawnbroker's
case,
the
judge
there
said
that
the
bribe
that
the
taxpayer
of
that
freedom
from
unreasonable
harassment
which
he
has
the
right
to
exist
under
a
democratic
form
of
government
is
not
something
to
which
courts
should
lend
their
aid.
now,
all
we
have
here
your
honors
are
cases
that
come
to
court.
these
are
only
cases
in
which
judicial
enforcement
is
sought.
my
friend
says
there
are
about
a
hundred
fraud
cases
a
year.
well,
of
that
hundred
fraud
cases
a
year,
i
would
hope
that
the
commissioner
would
haven't
the
slightest
degree
of
trouble.
my
friend
says
that
in
the
fourth
and
seventh
circuits,
the
judges
have
not
addressed
themselves
to
the
test.
well,
i'll
tell
you
why
your
honors.
because
in
the
fourth
and
the
seventh
circuit
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief,
the
testimony
that
the
government
offered
was
so
overwhelming.
that
the
court
said,
“oh,
go
on
with
your
examination”
and
granted
them
in
both
cases
and
by
the
way
that
was
just
in
1961.
that
was
just
this
past
two
years
ago,
three
years
ago
that
the
government
was
still
appearing
and
not
taking
the
position
it
did.
in
our
case,
the
judge
begged
the
government
just
to
give
them
a
witness
and
a
remarkable
sequence
of
events
happened.
the
judge
said,
“well,
i
agree
with
the
taxpayer.
but
after
all
an
hour
is
not
going
to
hurt
anybody,
i'll
ask
them
to
be
gentlemanly
and
kind
and
sweet
and
if
you
--
will
you
promise
to
be
sweet?”
and
they
said,
“we'll
promise
to
be
sweet.”
well
he
said,
“i'll
give
you
an
hour.”
and
we
just
didn't
think
the
principle
involved.
we
didn't
think
frankly
they
could
get
anything
in
an
hour
even
if
there
were
anything
there.
but
the
principle
was
too
big
to
give
into
that
kind
of
expediency.
my
friend
says
that
the
fifth
circuit
permits
examination
under
the
theory
he
wishes.
well,
that
intrigued
me
when
it
was
said
in
the
lower
court.
it
amazes
me
when
it
said
in
this
court
because
the
same
records
i
dug
out
of
the
cage
in
louisiana
were
available
to
my
friends
on
the
other
side.
i
sent
down
to
louisiana
and
i
got
two
extensive
affidavits
and
i'm
willing
to
submit
them
to
your
honors
and
to
say
that
any
time
the
commissioner
gives
that
kind
of
proof
of
a
suspicion
of
fraud,
he's
certainly
entitled
to
go
on
with
this
examination.
the
fifth
circuit
is
a
clear
circuit
that
has
applied
the
test
to
which
the
government
requested
and
only
in
the
second
circuit,
the
foster
case
has
the
court
in
line
which
given
the
government
what
it
is
now
seeking.
and
in
fact,
the
government
gave
the
court
what
we
are
seeking,
because
in
the
foster
case,
the
government
went
much
farther
than
it
did
in
our
case.
so
that
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
far
from
being
so
onerous
as
to
render
tax
collection
difficult,
impossible,
the
fact
is
that
simple
fairness
would
dictate
that
congress
should,
if
it
didn't
as
i
hope
i
can
demonstrate
it
did,
have
provided
this
reasonable
safeguard
against
the
onus
of
a
fraud
investigation
on
innocent
people.
and
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that
even
the
innocent
must
stand
the
onus
if
there's
a
reasonable
ground
for
suspicion
of
fraud.
it
may
be
under
that
circumstance
assumed
that
fraud
will
not
be
proof
but
obviously
administratively,
we
have
to
allow
the
tax
collector
a
very
considerable
leeway.
now,
i
dispose
of
oklahoma
press
and
morton
salt
very
quickly.
those
cases
simply
have
no
relevancy
here.
what
was
involved
there
was
the
simple
question
of
whether
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
objections
to
the
statutory
power
was
valid
and
the
court
held
they
weren't
valid,
they're
very
broad
statutes
and
i
say
categorically
here
that
if
congress
wanted
to
say
broad
or
no
broad,
statute
or
no
statute,
all
the
commissioner
has
to
do
is
send
an
agent
out
without
so
much
as
a
letter.
congress
has
the
right
to
do
it.
we
just
don't
think
it
did
that
here.
now,
as
to
this
legislation
i
want
to
say
this
to
your
honors,
we
do
think
that
there
is
significance
that
in
the
face
of
all
these
cases,
the
court
--
the
congress
never
changed
the
rule.
and
we
think
that
it
is
not
correct
to
say
as
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
only
when
this
court
has
acted
will
the
rule
apply
that
congress
will
be
regarded
when
it
reenacts
a
code
and
reenacts
it
again
as
having
adopted
the
interpretation
of
the
courts.
only
when
this
court
acts
will
that
happen
and
i
cite
to
your
honors
missouri
against
ross
where
this
court
had
not
spoken,
except
admittedly
by
way
of
dictum
and
the
reliance
of
this
court
in
imposing
that
view
on
the
interpretation
of
the
congressional
act
was
based
on
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
there's
no
showing,
in
fact,
your
honor
and
i
may
say
that
i've
read
the
cases
and
in
most
of
them,
there's
not
really
fact
showing.
it's
just,
the
court
seems
to
assume
that
in
a
matter
so
vital
as
this
and
more
important
--
and
i'll
place
--
i'm
willing
to
waive
that
point,
more
important
to
me
is
the
fact
that
although
we
know
that
the
guardian
of
the
legislative
process
insofar
the
prime
actors
and
so
far
as
tax
laws
are
concerned
are
my
friends
on
the
other
side
and
some
1921
with
all
these
cases.
they
have
never
seen
fit
once
the
state
of
congress
give
us
some
relief
and
i
read
last
night
the
report
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
for
1962.
he
says
he
made
130
legislative
suggestions
in
1962,
1963
the
last
year
he
made
74,
not
one
of
them
was,
give
me
relief
here.
and
i
suggest
that
you
ought
not
ask
this
court
to
give
them
the
relief.
he
ought
to
ask
congress
and
i
suspect,
indeed
i
feel
confident
the
reason
he
doesn't
go
to
congress
is,
that
congress
is
not
going
to
take
away
this
protection
from
the
taxpayer.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
surely.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
i
want
to
get
to
that
statute
and
i'm
just
about
to
discuss.
no,
i
want
to
say
just
in
the
legislative
history,
if
it
please
your
honor,
that
actually
you
can
read
that
either
way
as
so
often
happened
in
the
legislative
history.
for
example
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
in
introducing
that
said,
“it
ought
to
be
settled
once
for
all
when
a
man
pays
his
tax”,
which
we
of
course
have
done,
“unless
there
should
be
good
cause
for
reexamination”,
that's
what
i
think
congressmen,
when
it
put
in
the
provision
that
there
should
be
no
reexamination,
unless
it
shall
be
necessary.
and
i
think
particularly
it
meant
that
because
when
it
wrote
it,
the
statute
that
was
on
the
books
incidentally,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
goldberg
was
a
five-year
statute
at
the
time.
but
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
and
they
knew
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
and
i'll
come
back
for
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'm
arguing
a
reexamination
but
i
believe
that
the
ryan
case
would
call
for
the
same
rule.
i
would
have
to
say
that
very
frankly,
your
honor,
because
the
first
part
of
that
section
which
to
my
mind
is
as
clearly
separate
from
the
rest
as
any
statute
i've
ever
read,
simply
says
that
no
taxpayer
shall
be
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
examination.
the
only
thing
they
did
as
to
reexaminations
was
to
put
in
a
kind
of
intradepartmental
rule,
which
the
commissioner
could
have
done
on
his
own.
all
the
excitement,
your
honor
wasn't
about
that
intradepartmental
rule
have
the
regional
commissioner
because
we
know
very
well
that
the
regional
commissioner
is
entirely
subject
with
his
vast
amount
of
work
to
what
this
agent
says.
if
in
the
ryan
case
it
is
true
that
the
agent
had
a
personal
grudge
because
his
brother
was
arrested,
that
wouldn't
come
to
the
regional
commissioner,
all
he
would
do
is
he
would
say;
go
ahead.
so,
it
becomes
pretty
formal,
and
that's
apparent
in
our
case.
for
example,
inadvertently,
the
cat
was
right
out
of
the
bag
because
he
wrote
his
letter
in
february
and
then
the
affidavit
of
the
agent
quite
inadvertent
and
i'm
sure
said
that
he
has
been
conducting
an
investigation
since
february.
i
don't
think
they
caught
up
with
that
yet,
because
frankly
i
didn't
catch
up
with
it
until
three
minutes
ago.
sitting
there
--
or
ten
minutes
ago
sitting
here
in
the
courtroom.
well
now,
your
honors,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
under
section
7602,
before
the
three
years
run,
the
commissioner
has
almost
plenary
power.
just
think
of
what
he's
got
to
do.
he's
got
the
cover
16
million
taxpayers
with
an
obligation
to
do
something,
so
there
it's
plenary
in
the
absence
of
oppressiveness
than
the
usual
routine
matters.
under
section
6501,
i
think
there's
a
prima
facie
presumption
necessarily
aroused.
the
--
under
6501,
a
real
change
occurs,
it
isn't
routine.
there
can
no
longer
be
an
assessment
made
by
the
collector,
unless
he
proves
an
affirmative
fact,
it's
no
longer
routine.
now,
he's
got
to
prove
something.
and
what
is
that
fact?
that
fact
is
that
there
is
fraud.
now,
7605
(b)
comes
along
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
what
the
government
is
endeavoring
to
do
is
to
sterilize
7605
(b)
which
was
held
as
a
kind
of
declaration
of
independence
for
the
taxpayer.
he's
got
to
say
as
mr.
justice
stewart
observed,
he's
got
to
say
that
that
first
sentence,
is
surplusage.
he's
got
to
say
the
first
sentence
that
no
taxpayers
shall
be
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
examination
and
surplusage
and
then
he's
got
to
say,
that
what
your
honors
said
in
reisman,
you
didn't
really
mean
because
if
it
is
true
that
section
6501
has
meaning
when
interlaced
and
intertwined
with
7602
and
7605
(b)
and
against
the
background
of
the
judicatory
adversary
hearing
permitted
and
required
under
7604.
if
that
is
true,
then
the
function
of
the
court
has
got
to
be
to
hear
and
determine
and
that's
what
the
word
unreasonable
was.
it's
the
word
like
the
word
negligence.
it's
a
word
of
flexibility.
what
is
reasonable
before
the
three
years
statute
becomes
unreasonable
after
the
three
years
statute
and
what
is
unreasonable
after
the
three-year
statute
might
very
well
be
entirely
reasonable
before
that.
but,
you
can't
read
these
provisions,
if
it
please
your
honors,
in
isolation.
it's
only
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
say
your
honors
that
unnecessary
i
would
say
you
could
take
the
meaning
of
unreasonable.
unnecessary
is
something
which
is
not
pursuant
to
the
particular
needs,
which
is
not
fair,
which
is
not
statutorily
approved.
now,
when
the
statute
has
run,
when
the
statute
has
run,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
from
that
moment
on,
the
power
becomes
a
different
power
and
unreasonable
has
a
different
meaning
and
it's
for
the
court
to
apply,
just
as
the
court
has
applied
it
in
permitting
the
examination
on
every
occasion
where
the
government
came
forward
and
gave
the
test,
because
it
found
in
each
of
those
cases
is
not
fraud.
i
think
the
court
was
at
it
should
be,
very
liberal.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
is
barred
in
this
adversary
hearing
from
determining
whether
it
is
“unreasonable.”
my
friend
say
that
because
of
a
summary
provision
later
in
that
section,
which
says,
if
you
want
a
second
examination,
then
you
got
to
have
the
regional,
you've
got
to
have
a
secretary
or
his
delegate
to
do
it
and
he's
got
to
say,
i've
done
it.
that's
nothing
but
intradepartmental
rule,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
if
it
please
the
court.
now,
in
conclusion
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
unnecessary,
unnecessary
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
certainly,
no
what
they
have
said
is
that
they
have
agreed,
they've
expressed
it
in
two
ways
in
the
cases.
one
that
they
have
to
show
a
reasonable
basis
for
suspecting
fraud.
two,
they
have
to
show
probable
cause
for
suspecting
fraud.
i
think
the
first
is
the
lesser
test
and
judge
hastie
used
the
language
both
ways,
i
think
judge
browning's
language
may
very
well
be
just
as
good,
i
don't
know
why
he
thought
it
necessary
to
introduce
still
another
term,
a
rational
judgment,
that's
to
show
a
rational
--
that
he
reached
a
rational
judgment
in
his
suspicion
from
fraud
(voice
overlap).
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
your
honor
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
if
your
honor
will,
you
see
it
throughout
the
cases.
you
will
find
it
in
martin
against
chandis
where
they
said
in
that
but
they
have
to
prove
probable
cause
which
i
think
is
probably
a
little
more
stringent
than
a
reasonable
basis.
and
in
a
word,
our
feeling
is
that
courts
have
got
to
recognize
the
realities
of
life
which
are
that
in
our
society
a
fraud
examination
does
carry
an
implication
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
someone
unfriendly
to
a
taxpayer,
unfriendly
to
a
justice
of
this
court
ought
to
have
no
right
to
cast
the
suspicion.
just
think
of
what
happens
if
word
got
around
with
full
deference
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren
that
an
unfriendly
administration
was
getting
his
bank
account,
so
i'd
asked
him
for
all
his
records,
why
you
could
never
undo
that
in
the
lifetime
of
our
distinguished
chief
justice
and
i
suggest
that
every
taxpayer
is
entitled
of
same
protection.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice,
confronted
by
the
necessity
of
answering
what
really
amounts
to
a
narrower
argument
on
the
other
side
in
two
cases
so
related,
i'm
wondering
whether
i
might
ask
for
three
or
four
additional
minutes
beside
the
30,
i'm
allowed.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
do
so
only
because
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh
no,
i
do
so
only
because
of
the
hour
devoted
to
virtually
the
same
cases
on
the
other
side.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
alright.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
fine,
but
i
will
remember
to
do
so.
now,
i
will
consider
that.
first,
i
should
like
to
correct
and
this
is
one
of
my
problems,
the
misapprehension
created
in
the
other
argument
yesterday,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
that
there
is
a
simple
expedient
here
that
the
government
can
just
go
to
the
tax
court.
your
honors,
will
remember
that,
that
was
the
answer
you
got
form
mr.
begley
when
you
asked
the
question,
that
simply
isn't
so.
in
the
first
place,
the
government
can
never
go
to
the
tax
court.
the
tax
court
is
not
available
to
the
government.
in
the
second
place,
what
would
happen
in
the
related
situation,
demonstrates
the
safeguard
that
congress
did
place
on
fraud
cases
because
what
would
happen
is
the
taxpayer
would
got
a
90-day
letter.
he
would
then
come
to
the
tax
court
and
ask
the
tax
court
to
stay
the
assessment.
then
the
government
would
have
to
raise
the
defense
of
fraud
and
the
statute
expressly
says
that,
then
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
fraud
and
the
rules
say
it
must
then
set
forth
all
the
facts
that
constitute
the
fraud.
then
it
must
improve
suspicion
of
fraud,
it
must
then
prove
fraud.
so
that
as
your
honors
can
see
that
government
even
if
allowed
to
go
the
tax
court
under
those
circumstances
never
would
because
it
would
have
to
show
all
the
facts
and
would
have
a
far
greater
burden.
so
that
simply
was
on
a
say,
with
full
deference
an
erroneous
answer
to
the
justices'
question.
second
i
should
like
to
point
out,
yesterday
i
said
that
it
was
not
available
to
the
government
in
this
case,
the
argument
on
the
affidavit's
conclusory
statement
about
over
purchases.
since
that
is
not
the
issue
presented
for
certiorari
and
it
wasn't
the
issue
argued
in
the
district
court.
but
there's
a
much
more
fundamental
reason,
i
should
like
to
refer
your
honors
to
that
argument
by
the
court,
because
it
really
shows
what
the
courts
--
what
the
government's
concept
is
of
a
fair
hearing
in
this
case.
because
what
it
means
is
that
the
court
believes
--
the
government
believes
that
all
it
has
to
do
is
file
an
affidavit,
refuse
to
permit
the
witness
to
appear,
and
on
that
conclusory
statement
get
relief.
now,
your
honors
will
remember
that
in
reisman,
this
court
held
and
the
government
contended
the
very
opposite
of
that.
it
said,
don't
permit
the
government
to
be
enjoined
by
the
taxpayer
because
he
has
the
right
to
a
full
adversary
hearing.
now
is
that
a
hearing?
you
file
an
affidavit
with
a
conclusory
statement,
you
refuse
to
produce
the
witness,
isn't
cross-examination
the
first
fundamental
of
a
fair
hearing?
so
i
say
to
your
honors
that
while
the
substance
isn't
available,
the
argument
really
points
out,
the
government's
view
point
here
that
what
the
court
is
a
rubber
stamp.
that
when
the
government
comes
to
the
court
for
enforcement
all
the
court
can
do
is
say,
"here's
an
affidavit,
you
don't
have
to
produce
the
witness,
he
doesn't
have
to
be
cross-examined."
and
now
mr.
justice
black
to
relieve
your
mind
as
to
the
length
of
the
hearings,
may
i
say
that
i
have
reviewed
all
of
the
cases.
in
only
one
case
did
the
hearing
exceed
a
day,
because
all
that's
involved
is
the
suspicion
of
fraud
and
therefore
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
to
put
the
agent
on
and
in
these
cases
what
has
happened
is
the
agent
says
"here
are
my
grounds
for
suspecting
fraud."
there
is
usually
nothing
the
taxpayer
can
do
except
cross-examine
him
as
to
the
honesty
of
whether
he
is
giving
answers
that
are
true.
on
one
or
two
occasions,
there
was
countervailing
testimony,
in
only
one
case
was
a
day-and-a-half
consumed,
usually
a
half
day
is
consumed
in
all
this
cases.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
only
issue
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
suspecting
fraud,
whether
it
can
meet
this
burden
relatively
slight
which
is
cast
upon
it.
in
the
relatively
few
cases
out
of
the
60
million
taxpayers,
where
it
wants
to
allege
fraud,
whether
before
it
can
place
on
the
taxpayer
the
onus
of
a
fraud
examination,
it
comes
into
court
and
says
"your
honor,
we'd
like
our
summons
enforced
and
we'd
like
it
enforced
because
we
have
a
suspicion
of
fraud
and
the
reason
we
suspect
fraud
is
this”
and
all
the
cases
have
used
that
test
for
alternatively
probable
cause
except
judge
browning
who
has
used
this
rational
judgment.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh
mr.
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
can
look
into
it,
but
it
can
institute
an
examination
and
as
for
records
just
think
of
what
that
would
mean.
that
would
mean
that
every
taxpayer
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
every
citizen.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
real
question
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
whether
the
government
has
any
basis
to
go
into
it.
i
say
that
a
mere
letter
is
not
a
basis.
if
the
government
thinks
it's
a
basis
it
looks
at
--
it
looks
at
the
kind
of
house
the
man
lives
in
from
the
outside,
it
tries
to
get
such
superficial
evidence
as
it
can
get,
but
it
can't
act
and
ask
the
court
to
enforce
summons.
it
can
issue
a
summons
if
it
wants
to,
but
if
the
taxpayer
objects,
then
the
court
must
have
a
hearing
and
there's
an
obligation
on
what
the
government
must
show
and
this
is
what
congress
intended
to
protect
against.
this
is
why
congress
put
on
the
government
the
burden
of
proving
fraud.
this
is
why
all
these
cases
say
you
must
show
a
suspicion
of
fraud.
it
isn't
automatic
that
the
government
ought
to
have
the
right
to
examine
each
citizen
for
fraud.
it's
automatic
that
it
has
the
right
to
examine
each
citizen's
return
and
we
must
remember
that,
mr.
justice
goldberg
how
plenary
is
the
authority
of
the
government
in
the
first
three
years
and
it
uses
this
plenary
authority.
now
to
please
the
court,
as
i
left
the
court
yesterday
and
this
is
my
last
point,
i
thought
what
could
be
said
to
counter
the
force
and
the
specific
facts
of
the
history
that
i
related
to
your
honors
yesterday
of
the
practices
and
the
decisions
under
them,
certainly,
it
can't
be
said
that
the
statute
is
not
clear.
certainly
that
they're
not
old.
certainly
it
can't
be
said
the
treasury
department
has
ever
asked
for
an
amendment
or
that
congress
has
made
an
amendment
and
i
say
it
cannot
be
asserted
that
the
government
has
not
used
this
very
test
and
i
just
quote
one
case
to
your
honors
martin
against
chandis
back
in
1942
where
the
court
said,
"it
is
appellants,
that's
government's,
contention
that
the
only
showing
required
and
we
assume
also
that
the
only
contention
required
is"
and
i
quote
the
government's
contention,
“a
showing
of
probable
cause
sometimes
called
reasonable
ground
for
suspicion
of
fraud.”
that's
right
in
the
decision
of
the
court.
therefore,
the
only
possible
confusion
that
might
result
this
from
language
used
in
cases,
and
i
discount
the
second
circuit
for
the
moment,
where
the
holdings
are
contrary
to
some
of
the
language.
in
older
cases
where
they
talk
about
the
fourth
amendment
where
the
taxpayer
raises
the
defense
of
fraud.
in
newer
cases,
few
of
them
where
they
talk
about
oklahoma
press
and
morton
salt,
which
your
honors
will
recall
is
a
case
--
are
cases
where
there
were
challenges
under
--
constitutional
challenges
under
fourth
and
fifth
amendment,
where
it
was
assumed
that
the
statutory
authority
existed.
for
example,
in
the
first
part
of
de
masters,
and
that's
the
only
one
i
can
say
to
your
honor
judge
browning's
case,
there
is
language
in
which
he
rejects
probable
cause
as
a
test
citing
oklahoma
press
and
morton
press.
but
then
what
does
he
go
on
to
do?
first,
he
shows
the
difference
in
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
in
the
three
years
and
thereafter.
second,
he
goes
on
to
show
the
--
that
after
the
bar
the
burden
had
shifted.
third,
he
just
demonstrates
the
dichotomy
of
7605
(b)
showing
that
there
are
two
distinct
prohibitions,
and
the
first,
no
one
necessary
investigation
is
mandatory
is
the
word
he
uses
and
then
he
establishes
his
test.
that
reminds
me
if
your
honors
please,
of
mr.
justice
jackson's
favorite
quotation
from
byron
and
julia
saying,
she
never
would
consent,
consented
because
eventually
what
he
holds
is
and
i
quote
him,
"the
decision
to
investigate
a
innate
of
that
purpose,
namely
to
ascertain
whether
a
suspicion
of
fraud
is
present,
was
in
fact
reached
as
a
matter
of
rational
judgment
based
on
the
circumstances
of
particular
case”
which
wipes
out
the
language
as
it
does
in
the
other
cases.
now,
your
honors
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
absolutely
but
he
couldn't
--
he
just
be
out
just
like
that
your
honor.
the
authority
is
plenary
and
the
court
has
said
again
and
again
that's
why
you
don't
have
one
case.
not
one
reported
case
in
which
a
taxpayer
came
in.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
no,
no.
they
could
come
before
couple
of
a
hundred
district
courts.
they
needn't
wait
for
this
court
to
decide
it,
just
you
haven't
decided
that
these
cases
but
they're
here.
now
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
finish
with
this,
if
it
pleases
the
court.
this
is
one
of
the
only
two
cases
in
the
whole
history
of
the
statute
where
the
court
is
being
asked
to
enforce
a
summon
in
which
the
only
averment
is
a
conclusory
averment
in
an
affidavit,
the
witness
being
refused
to
appear.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
under
those
circumstances
that
would
be
adequate
proof.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
is
the
kind
of
proof
and
it
is
the
kind
of
proof
which
it
has
adduced
in
all
of
this
cases
and
if
it
desires
to
change
it,
if
it
please
the
court,
it
ought
to
go
to
congress
to
ask
the
change.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
i
think
that's
a
very
good
statement
your
honor
of
the
government's
position.
it
flies
in
the
face
of
the
congressional
purpose
from
the
beginning
of
our
government
that
when
fraud
is
alleged,
the
government
has
a
special
burden.
there
is
--
are
civil
rules
of
procedure,
all
of
the
statutes,
every
time
that
fraud
is
alleged
by
the
government,
the
burden
changes.
if
the
government
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
they
have
alleged.
they
must
allege
to
come
in
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
the
point
that
i
make
your
honor
is
it
if
you
read
these
statutes
and
you
read
their
purpose,
if
you
start
with
6501
which
certainly
as
the
courts
have
said
marks
a
demarcation,
he
can't
assess
after
the
three
years
unless
he
finds
fraud.
now
this
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
he
can
search
for
it
but
it
shifts
the
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yeah.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
can
search
for
it,
but
when
he
asked
the
court
to
enforce
a
summons,
then
he's
got
to
show
the
court
some
reason
for
calling
on
the
court
under
an
adversary
hearing
in
view
of
the
inter-relation
of
these
statutes
when
congress
put
in
the
provision
that
there
shall
be
no
unnecessary
examination,
he
would
have
to
concede
that
an
examination
is
unnecessary,
if
there's
no
suspicion
of
fraud.
it
has
to
concede
that.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
well
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
don't
think
he
doesn't
concede
that
an
examination
after
the
three
years
is
not
unnecessary
if
there
is
not
a
suspicion
of
fraud.
he
says,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
doesn't
have
to
disclose
what
his
suspicion
of
fraud
is.
i
don't
believe
the
collector
will
ever
say
that
he
would
start
an
examination
after
a
three-year
period
unless
he
had
the
suspicion
of
fraud.
the
real
issue
here
is,
whether
he
can
blindly
assert
that
in
spite
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
reisman
case
as
to
what
the
hearing
is
for,
in
spite
of
what
these
statute
say,
whether
he
can
say
to
the
court,
you
just
enforce
it
on
my
assertion
and
i
say
to
your
honor
that
over
the
years
that
has
not
been
the
position
the
government
took,
it's
for
some
reason
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
position
that
take
just
in
this
two
cases.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
except
i
think
it
is
persuasive,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
a
whole
series
of
treasury
departments
and
a
whole
series
of
administrations
that
one
interpretation
of
the
act
which
the
courts
have
sustained,
and
that
another
commissioner
suddenly
comes
in
and
says,
oh
i
have
a
different
idea,
i
don't
have
to
show
anything,
although
i
wouldn't
bring
it
if
i
didn't
have
a
suspicion
of
fraud.
