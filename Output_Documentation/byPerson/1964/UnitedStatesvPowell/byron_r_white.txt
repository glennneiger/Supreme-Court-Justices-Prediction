justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
terris,
let
me
ask
this
one
brief
question.
if
petitioner
--
with
--
if
the
position
urged
by
ryan
or
powell
were
accepted,
will
the
practical
effect
be
that
he
government
would
get
the
books
only
if
the
taxpayer
who
himself
was
suspected
of
fraud.
if
he
--
if
he
came
into
court
and
asked
for
books,
the
taxpayer
said,
“well,
the
statute
barred.”
the
judge
says
overrule
it.
“you
must
tell
me
that
you
suspect
fraud
or
tell
me
a
reasonable
cause
of
fraud
is
i
take
that
means
fraud
in
connection
with
fact
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
7602
gives
you
authority
to
get
the
taxpayer's
books
where
you
can
look
for
gift
tax
than
somebody
else
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
is
that
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
unnecessary
mean
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
your
--
the
governments'
first
point
to
the
court
is
that
they
--
it
doesn't
need
to
say
anything
other
than
the
--
well
this
material
--
these
records
are
material
in
relevance.
you
don't
need
to
say
that
we
suspect
fraud
as
we
made
the
investigation
and
certainly
don't
have
to
show
in
fact.
it's
just
to
say
there
are
no
statute
of
limitations
on
fraud
and
we
can
search
for
fraud
anytime,
just
like
that
we
can
search
for
anything
else
more
than
three
years
and
runs
to
another
matter
and
what's
your
answer
to
that
anyway?
i
think
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
on
fraud,
why
shouldn't
the
government
be
able
to
search
for
fraud
anytime,
just
like
it
could
search
for
anything
else
within
the
three
years
and
not
constructed
to
the
act,
the
word
necessary
doesn't
make
--
it
doesn't
mean
anymore
after
three
years
in
connection
with
fraud,
does
the
word
necessary
means
before
the
three
years
of
everything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
government
hasn't
alleged
anything,
so
that
we
don't
have
to
until
we've
searched
and
we
can
go
around
and
search
any
body's
records
for
fraud
at
anytime?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say
they
don't
have
to,
that's
the
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
but
we
can
search
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
he
said,
i
can
search
for
fraud
anytime.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
can
assess
it
anytime
i
like.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
concede
that
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
we
have
dealt
with
these
case
before,
so
i
suppose
we
have
to
at
least
look
at
the
statutory
language.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
certainly
consistent
with
your
position
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
be
here
all
right,
but
i'm
not
sure
--
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
maintain
the
intermediate
grounds
either
you're
going
one
way
or
the
other
especially
with
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
with
70
--
when
that
paragraph
b
tells
you
in
plain
language,
you
know
on
the
second
examination
all
you
need
is
a
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
argue
any
way
you
want
to.
i'm
just
saying
it
sounds
very
difficult
to
maintain
the
intermediate
grounds,
that's
all.
