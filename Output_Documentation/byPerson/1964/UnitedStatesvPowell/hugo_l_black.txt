justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
how
do
you
spell
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
okay,
i
see.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
relying
on
any
word
unreasonable
some
other
part
of
it
or
you're
just
relying
on
the
word
“unnecessary”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
7605(b)
been
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
parts
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
rely
on
the
second
part
at
all?
i
haven't
heard
you
mention
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
claimed
now
the
secretary
has
the
right
to
use
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
be
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
the
legislative
history
shows
during
that
period
since
1921,
there
has
been
any
effort
to
change
7605
(b)
in
any
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
suggestions
in
the
books,
the
commentators,
the
books,
text
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
the
government
been
using
the
method
of
having
special
examinations
with
the
special
attorneys
from
the
treasury
department
and
the
ways
and
means
committee
and
the
finance
committee
in
connection
with
these
taxes?
i
recall
that
certainly
over
30
years
ago
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
go
into
them
very
carefully
paragraph
by
paragraph.
it
happened
in
the
general
revision
in
1956,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
remained
unchanged,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
would
have
to
show
the
judge,
even
if
you
didn't
have
an
affidavit,
you'd
have
to
show,
wouldn't
you,
that
the
secretary
had
given
notice
as
required
by
7605(b).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
just
one
other
thing
about
regulation,
is
that
what
happen?
but
are
they
into
regulation,
if
you
look
to
see
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
is
nothing
that's
in
your
regulation
that
could
have
misled
a
taxpayer
to
believe
that
you
had
to
do
this.
