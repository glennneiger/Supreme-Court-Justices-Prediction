mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
restate
what
the
government's
position
is
again.
we
do
take
the
position,
mr.
justice
white
that
we
do
not
have
to
suspect
fraud.
now
as
a
matter
of
practice,
we
don't
do
that.
i
indicated
yesterday
that
we
don't
do
random
sampling.
the
service
has
never
done
and
it
wouldn't
be
very
practical
to
do
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
it
could
do
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
except
for
--
it's
impractical
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
burden
on
taxpayers
and
we
do
not
do
it.
now,
our
alternative
theory
is
it's
enough
to
have
an
affidavit
saying
we
suspect
fraud
and
that
is
of
course,
what
is
done
in
this
case.
and
the
problem
of
whether
that
issue
is
now
in
the
case
because
it
wasn't
included
in
the
petition
i
think
is
hardly
a
serious
one
because
that
exact
issue
was
in
our
petition
and
the
question
in
the
petition
is
broad
enough
to
cover
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
do.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
point
your
honor,
that
we're
trying
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
--
you
can
cross-examine
on
anything
that's
an
issue,
but
there
--
what
is
not
in
issue
is
whether
the
government
has
probable
cause.
now,
that
is
an
issue
then
mr.
segal
is
quite
right
then
the
cross-examination
is
an
order.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
he
says
that
it's
reasonable
basis
to
suspect,
i
think
is
some
--
his
phrase
and
if
that's
an
issue
whether
the
government
has
reasonable
basis
to
suspect
then
cross-examination
is
an
order.
that's
our
point
that
there's
going
to
be
a
full
trial
if
mr.
segal
is
correct,
that
the
government
has
to
make
a
showing.
that
is
the
point
or
one
of
the
points
of
our
case.
now,
this
argument
that
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
be
a
rubber
stamp
was
made
to
this
court
in
the
oklahoma
press
case.
that
exact
issue
was
made,
not
only
in
constitutional
terms
but
in
statutory
terms.
this
court
rejected
it.
it
said
there
were
great
many
issues
that
could
be
raised.
the
same
kind
of
issues,
the
parallel
issue
as
can
be
raised
at
the
hearing
on
enforcement
proceeding
for
an
internal
revenue
service
summons.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
our
first
position
is
we
didn't
need
the
affidavit.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
our
alternative
position;
now,
mr.
segal
says
that
this
is
the
first
time
that's
occurred.
it
is
not
the
first
time.
the
second
circuit
in
the
forester
case
upheld
that
position
of
the
government.
we
put
on
an
--
we
gave
an
affidavit,
the
government
was
upheld.
the
fifth
circuit
did
the
same
thing
in
the
globe
construction
company
case.
so
that
this
is
not
the
first
time.
it's
at
least
the
third
time
and
in
two
previous
times
the
government
has
been
successful.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
the
hearing
would
be
confined
to
that
issue
unless
he
makes
some
kind
of
a
showing
through
the
agent
or
through
other
means,
that
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
didn't
say
that
he
wanted
to
prove
it
was
a
shake
down.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
may
say
in
addition
your
honor
that
he
could
have
called
the
agent.
we
didn't
call
the
agent.
it
was
--
there
was
no
indication
that
the
agent
wouldn't
have
appeared
if
the
other
side
had
asked
for
him
so
that,
that
question
we
really
don't
get
to
that
question
in
this
case
and
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
that
would
be
the
procedural
way
that
you
would
get
to
the
shake
down
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
our
first
position.
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
our
first
position
is
we
don't
need
an
affidavit
at
all.
the
second
one,
our
alternative
theory
is
we
do
and
we
have
one.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
same
procedure.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
and
as
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
not
up
till
now
we
haven't
had
to
make
any
kind
of
a
showing.
i
think
if
this
court
indicates
that
a
showing
is
necessary
in
a
fraud
case
unless
it's
very
careful
in
it's
opinion
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
first
--
our
first
point
is
that
it
doesn't
have
any
separate
meaning
other
the
second
part
of
the
section.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
that
is
the
issue.
then
the
second
sub-issue
of
that
is
what
does
unnecessary
mean
and
we
think
webster
makes
clear
what
it
means
and
it
doesn't
mean
when
mr.
segal
reads
into
it,
unreasonable.
that
is
not
what's
in
webster
and
i
assume
that,
that
--
unless
there
is
some
gloss
put
on
it
by
the
legislative
history
that,
that
meaning
should
be
followed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
provision
of
the
code
applies
to
after
three
years
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
purport
to
limit
that
provision.
section
7602
provides
--
covers
across
the
board
without
limitation.
now,
the
respondents
are
arguing
that
implicit
in
the
statute
of
limitations
is
this
limitation.
yet
they
themselves
admit
that
section
7605
(b)
is
not
confined.
in
terms
as
of
course
it
isn't
to
just
the
period
after
the
statute
of
limitations
is
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
that,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
if
we're
wrong
about
the
period
after
three
years,
i'm
suggesting
there
may
be
a
problem
about
the
period
before
three
years.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
the
right
to
inquire
whether
this
was
a
burdensome
request,
if
it
wasn't
i
think
that
--
in
other
words
if
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
well
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
to
suggest
a
broad
meaning
of
arbitrary
because
then
i
think
what
we're
merely
going
to
come
up
with
is
that
now
arbitrary
means
at
least
we're
going
to
be
back
to
the
same
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
it's
quite
clear
that
that
general
rule
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
make
a
showing
as
respondents'
arguments.
that's
certain,
at
least
that
much
oklahoma
press
and
morton
salt
and
the
other
cases
establish
that.
it's
not
abuse
of
process
to
even
be
doing
a
fishing
expedition,
that's
what
morton
salt
was.
that's
well
beyond
--
well,
that's
the
random
sampling
i
suppose
and
morton
salt
says
an
administrative
subpoena
is
essentially
the
equivalent
of
a
grand
jury
one.
now,
really
the
only
issue
is
whether
7605(b)
cuts
across
that
and
changes
the
rule
heretofore
--
within
the
tax
field.
i
think
that's
the
burden
of
respondents
to
show
that
the
rule
has
been
changed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
since
1921,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
positively
rely
affirmative
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
relied
in
the
sense
that
we
think
the
only
restriction
on
this
--
for
second
examinations
is
that
this
kind
of
statutory
notice
be
given
a
statutory
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
was
given
and
we
suggest
that
other
than
relevancy,
and
materiality
and
the
various
constitutional
objections
which
are
possible,
that
is
all
that
is
necessary.
that's
right
your
honor.
that
is
the
reason
we
believe
we
satisfy
section
7605
(b).
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
that's
the
only
meaning
of
necessary.
it
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
first
examinations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
one
of
our
positions.
the
second
one
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
once
the
notices
are
given.
our
second
argument
is
even
if
it
does
apply
to
first
examinations
and
the
second
examinations
when
notice
has
been
given,
it
means
useless
or
needless
which
is
essentially
is
relevancy.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there's
no
indication
that
there
has
been
any
desire
on
anybody's
part
to
change
it.
no
discussion
in
the
reenactments.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
it's
been
a
long
time
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1954
and
1939
and
there
was
no
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
i
may
say
--
let
me
turn
to
this
business
about
the
change
in
the
government's
position.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
government
didn't
have
a
position
until
very
recently.
there
were
only
a
half
dozen
cases
over
30
years
and
the
us
attorneys
handled
them
as
they
thought
best,
which
meant
essentially
the
district
court
thought
that
so
much
evidence
would
be
necessary.
the
us
attorney
tried
to
supply
that
much
evidence.
now
in
the
last
few
years,
particularly
since
the
first
circuit
rule
came
into
effect
this
of
course
has
started
a
rash
of
litigation.
immediately
then
the
government
sat
down
and
said,
"we've
got
to
come
up
with
a
position".
obviously,
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
litigation
in
this
subject
that
position
is
the
one
that
we're
arguing
here.
that's
why
we
stood
on
the
affidavit
in
this
case,
because
we
want
to
establish
that
principle.
if
we're
going
to
have
full
trials
of
these
cases
then
we're
in
difficulty
and
i
think
the
difficulty
is
shown
by
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
that
isn't
our
position.
that's
our
secondary
position.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yeah.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we'd
be
here
anyway
if
we
could
have
them
supply
an
affidavit.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
don't
see
why
we
can't
argue
alternatively
your
honor.
we
would
win
in
this
case
on
either
one.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
yes.
that
does
not
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
what
we
did.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now,
let
me
point
to
the
hardship
to
the
government.
i
think
this
case
is
an
excellent
example.
here,
the
government
didn't
have
to
show
fraud
when
this
summon
was
issued.
we
could
have
shown
25%
under
statement
of
income.
now,
what's
happened
because
of
the
delay
from
this
litigation
we
can't
assess
for
under
statement
of
income.
now,
we
have
to
show
fraud.
now,
mr.
segal
can
say,
"yes
we've
got
this
heavier
burden.
"we
didn't
have
it
originally.
well,
this
is
a
marvelous
opportunity
for
taxpayers.
before
we
can
really
get
into
an
investigation
we're
blocked
at
the
start
with
a
full
trial,
it
would
amount
to
a
miniature
trial,
an
appeal
ultimately
in
this
court
and
we
haven't
even
gotten
a
chance
to
investigate.
now,
he
says,
well
all
we
had
to
do
is
make
some
showing.
what's
obvious
that
it
wasn't
just
some
showing
that
was
required,
because
he
says
that
an
anonymous
letter
isn't
enough.
in
addition
to
that
he
says,
"well,
mr.
powell
would
have
complied
if
there
been
some
showing."
well
that's
a
very
curious
statement,
because
in
a
different
case
involving
one
of
mr.
klein's
enterprises
which
mr.
segal
cites
in
his
brief,
the
government
served
a
summons
on
mr.
powell,
he
refused
to
comply.
we
went
into
the
district
court,
we
produced
the
agent,
we
produced
third
party
affidavits,
we
produced
documentary
evidence,
he
still
didn't
comply.
the
district
court
refused
to
enforce
the
summons,
not
on
the
ground
we
hadn't
made
a
showing.
he
said
"we
have.
we
had
in
negative
all
the
other
possible
explanations
of
the
conduct
of
mr.
klein”.
now,
these
are
the
kinds
of
cases
we're
having
and
i
don't
think
it
takes
any
great
stretch
of
imagination
to
see
that
this
is
a
serious
hardship
from
the
government
which
interferes
with
our
investigations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honor
if
the
--
we
were
talking
their
about
bad
faith?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
or
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
a
shake
down
or
some
kind
of
thing
of
abuse
of
process.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
only
want
to
hesitate
in
terms
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
i
think
its
very
possible
and
we
--
this
is
hasn't
been
--
i
don't
think
that
thought
--
certainly
has
been
by
me
and
i
don't
know
what
the
services
position
would
be,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
like
it,
that
i
think
we
might
stand
on
the
idea
that
there
had
to
be
some
showing
before
this
issue
could
be
gone
into,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
our
position
would
be
your
honor.
there
haven't
been
any
cases
that
i
know
of.
like
the
closest
one
is
ryan
in
a
sense,
but
he
never
actually
articulated
to
the
district
court
this
issue.
we
just
sort
of
threw
some
evidence
in
and
then
stood
on
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
no.
we
don't
--
the
business
of
inquiry
into
good
faith,
we
definitely
accept
that.
the
question
is
only
the
procedures.
i'm
told
by
the
way
we
would
produce
the
agent.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
there
is
no
reason
to
mean
he
wasn't.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
were
not
going
to
produce
him
as
our
witness.
we
stood
on
the
affidavit
of
our
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
on
our
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
was
no
application
to
produce
and
i'm
told
that
we
wouldn't
have
contested
it.
that
our
practice
would
be
to
allow
him
to
testifying.
well
as
his
witness.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now,
but
let
me
be
clear
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
would
presume
we
would
then
get
to
cross-examine
him
like
any
other
witness
produced
for
fraud.
but,
let
me
be
clear
though
about
this.
our
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
let
me
be
clear
though
about
this.
we
would
still
argue
that
any
testimony
he
gave
on
probable
cause
was
unnecessary
that
we
don't
have
to
show
probable
cause
or
a
reasonable
basis
to
suspect.
i
want
make
clear
that
we
wouldn't
be
giving
up
our
legal
position.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
sir.
i
looked
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i've
looked
at
the
regulations
and
they
are
general
your
honor.
they
are
specific
regulations
on
reopening
cases
and
on
giving
the
statutory
notices
