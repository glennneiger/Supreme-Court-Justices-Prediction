justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
along
the
lines
of
nacp
alabama
that
something
was
done
in
this
case
which
had
not
been
done
in
other
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
an
equal
protection
argument.
now
what's
the
other
one,
i
don't
quiet
follow
the
other
one?
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said
that
indeed
this
lower
court
did
have
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
again
an
equal
protection
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
are
those
mississippi
supreme
court
decisions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
are
cited
in
the
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
in
the
first
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
second
opinion
they
said
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
on
the
motion
for
direction
was
an
argument
specifically
addressed
to
the
incompetency
of
[inaudible]
record
to
the
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
argument,
on
the
motion
for
direction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
motion
was
made
and
denied
not
at
the
end
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
argument
was
not
offered
in
support
of
the
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
the
motion
for
direction
there
was
no
argument
offered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
just
about
just
estimates.
now,
looking
at
113,
mr.
carter
does
say
and
then
proceeded
to
go
and
searched
the
car
and
clearly
this
is
a
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
it
is
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
so
the
evidence
they
have
secured
against
this
defendant
is
illegal
and
unlawful.
but
the
point
was
expressly
made
to
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
looking
at
page
225,
what
you
said
i
gathered
it's
yours.
how
it
appears
from
the
record
that
the
trial
court
did
grab
an
instruction
that
the
defended
could
not
to
trial
guilty
on
the
unsupported
and
uncorroborated
testimony
of
the
complaining
witnesses
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
lyell,
on
that
same
subject,
what
--
244
and
245
the
supreme
court
said
about
that,
this
--
that
he,
that
is
the
defendant,
also
introduced
the
same
evidence,
that
this
kind
of
a
--
by
his
own
witnesses
including
photographs
of
the
interior
of
the
car,
we
are
therefore
of
the
further
opinion,
the
admission
of
such
evidence
unlawfully
obtained
of
error
was
secured
by
the
introduction
of
the
same
testimony
by
the
defendant
and
he
is
estopped
to
complain
that
such
evidence
was
erroneously
admitted
on
trial
for
consideration
of
the
jury.
but
i
gather
that
this
not
be
so,
that
the
record
shows
that
the
record
--
that
the
evidence
to
be
introduced
which
the
supreme
court
says
is
the
same
evidence
was
introduced
on
his
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
after
he
had
made
the
motion
for
direction
which
included
the
objection
expressly
to
the
admission
of
the
illegally
obtained.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it's
--
but
that's
what
i
read.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case
and
before
he
offered
any
evidence
and
that's
where
among
other
grounds
he
urged,
he
then
proceeded
to
go
and
search
the
car
and
clearly
this
is
a
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
it
is
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
so
the
evidence
that
they
have
secured
against
this
defendant
is
illegal
and
unlawful.
now,
what
the
supreme
court
must
be
referring
to
is
244,
245,
is
that
what's
after
that
objection
had
been
made,
that
it
has
introduced
by
the
defendant,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
what
i'm
getting
at
mr.
lyell
is
this.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
is
the
ground
upon
which
the
petition
will
prevail,
but
if
shouldn't,
if
we
should
conclude
that,
that
was
a
timely
motion
and
if
it's
not
an
adequate
state
ground
relied
upon
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
that
evidence
excluded
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case,
and
i
must
to
confess
to
myself,
i'd
have
trouble
seeing
how
that
effect
was
cured
by
anything
that
the
defendant
did
on
his
own
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
same
ms.
morris
that
neither
of
the
supreme
court
opinion
is
there
anything
which
disagrees
with
the
trial
judges'
instruction
that
it
required
corroboration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
--
what
the
trial
judge
said
is
confirmed
as
the
law
of
mississippi
in
the
first
court
opinion?
