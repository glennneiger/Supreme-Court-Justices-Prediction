because
on
the
arguendo

the
arguendo
of
the
state's
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
mrs
morris
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
--
to
support
your
preliminary
statements
here
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
persecution
of
this
person
because
of
this
affidavit?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
again
are
you
arguing
that
--
once
more,
things
which
they
had
done
in
other
cases
and
indeed
did
in
the
first
opinion
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sorry.
i
realized
we're
all
--
oh,
yeah
it's
pretty
hard
to
be
--
there
are
a
string
of
citations
of
mississippi
decisions
at
the
top
of
page
244
on
the
record
that
you
just
referred
us
to
as
to,
which
are
cited
in
support
of
this
rule
which
you
now
tell
us
doesn't
exist
and
i
assume
therefore,
you're
telling
us
that
these
cases
don't
stand
for
the
proposition
to
which
they're
cited?
i
haven't
read
the
case
yet.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wouldn't
want
you
to
do
that.
i
just
wanted
to

justice

stewart
if
you
are
referring
to
page
210
of
the
record,
the
last
full
paragraphs,
i
don't
read
it
the
same
way.
they
do
say
that
this
evidence
is
corroborating
and
important,
and
therefore
they
remand
that
they
don't
direct
acquittal,
they
remand
for
a
new
trial
and
there's
no
indication
at
all
that
corroboration
is
a
matter
of
law
necessary
in
mississippi.
after
we
find
the

and
they're
remanding
a
further
trial,
it
seems
somewhat
inconsistent
the
rule
you
express
otherwise,
they
might
have
directed
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
but
in
any
event,
it's
possible
to
read
it,
we
can
both
