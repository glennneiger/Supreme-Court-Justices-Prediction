ms.
morris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
miss
morris,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
miss
morris,
we've
taken
most
of
your
time
asking
questions,
you
may
have
an
additional
five
minutes
for
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
make
it,
if
you
have
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lyell,
while
you
were
justifying
that
portion
of
your
brief,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
what
justification
do
you
have
for
the
very
last
sentence
in
your
brief?
which
in
first
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
there
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
you
think
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
think
that
the
fact
that
he
may
have
stepped
over
legal
bounds
in
presenting
his
case
justifies
the
state
of
mississippi
in
bringing
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
this
court
for
the
purpose
of
poisoning
the
mind
of
this
court
then
--
and
the
public
against
this
man
when
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it.
there
is
no
issue
of
any
--
of
that
kind
in
the
record.
even
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
that
have
anything
do
to
with
what
you
suggest
here
about
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
want
us
to
believe
that
these
acts
are
true
in
order
to
help
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
he
had
half
a
dozen
witnesses.
doesn't
he
need
to
testify
to
his
good
character
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
was
anything
against
his
character
it
couldn't
--
or
reputation
couldn't
you
then
thought
at
the
end
if
you
had
wanted
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the
vice
that
you
use
to
poison
this
court
in
this
case
by
making
it
appear
that
this
man
had
--
was
guilty
of
prior
acts
of
perversion
when
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
such
is
the
case
and
you
know
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
case
and
you
had
an
opportunity,
if
there
had
been
any
such
acts
in
his
--
on
his
part
to
establish
it
at
least
in
accordance
with
his
reputation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
the
state
of
mississippi
--
if
the
defendant
practices
a
fraud
on
the
court,
do
you
feel
justified
in
perpetrating
a
bigger
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
answer
anything
that
they
have
alleged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren

morris.
