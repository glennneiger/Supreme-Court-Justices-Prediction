ms.
barbara
a.
morris
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
request
that
i'd
be
allowed
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
any
rebuttal
that
might
be
necessary.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
this
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court
results
from
another
instance
of
the
use
and
abuse
of
criminal
process
by
a
state
to
acquire
any
cause
for
conviction
of
the
defendant
or
an
alleged
criminal
charge,
a
negro,
defendant
then
whose
engagement
in
civil
rights
activities
and
whose
associational
--
and
whose
associations
are
not
here
related
to
this
case.
a
conviction
that
is
based
on
a
record
that
has
--
is
so
fraught
with
errors
and
fundamental
denials
as
due
process
that
if
anyone
of
the
basis
which
i
intend
to
discuss
are
not
sufficient.
the
cumulative
effect
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
reversal
of
this
case.
we
have
then
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
reversing
that
judgment
followed
by
the
suggestion
of
error
of
the
attorney
general
which
again
points
out
the
association
now
with
petitioner's
counsel
and
the
reason
i
mentioned
this
is
because
i
think
that
it
has
culminated
and
that
which
appears
on
page
13
and
14
of
the
state's
brief,
in
the
guise
of
seeking
relief
which
the
state
knows
it
cannot
get
here
and
it
would
be
improper
to
receive
here,
it
has
included
this
matter
and
i
don't
think
that
it
need
be
dignified
by
any
further
discussions,
but
i
would
call
it
to
the
attention
of
this
court.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
affidavits
sir.
i'm
talking
about
that
which
appears
on
the
final
paragraph
of
the
brief.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
i
am
indeed
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
i
think
there
is.
i
think
that
it
points
to
that
and
i
will
make
record
references
as
i
go
on
to
it.
you
will
recall
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned
that
the
first
description
of
a
negro
driving
big
black
car,
given
by
the
complaining
witness
and
which
appears
in
the
--
that
portion
of
the
transcripts,
158
and
159
which
is
the
original
statement
of
the
complainant,
where
the
party
was
asked
that
--
when
were
a
party
advised
them
that
the
person
driving
the
car
was
involved
in
discussed
segregation,
his
statement,
and
i
would
read
it
to
the
court,
is
they
knew
who
i
was
talking
about
right
away,
he
said
he
was
involved
with
nacp
or
something
and
the
same
theme
prevails
this
case
throughout
it
and
i
don't
think
that
it
is
of
--
not
in
the
sense
of
importance.
i
don't
think
this
is
glaring
as
some
of
the
other
errors
here,
but
i
think
that
this
last
issue,
i
think
demanded
that
it
be
raised.
apart
from
the
conduct
of
the
investigation
in
which
whatever
original
statement
the
complaining
witness
made
never
appeared
because
there
was
no
original
affidavit.
and
i
think
the
clarification
that
there
was
a
tailoring
considering
the
difference
between
the
writ
use
of
the
complaining
witness's
original
description
of
what
happened
and
his
final
testimony
at
trial,
so
that
the
defendant
--
a
crime
was
made
the
fit
the
defendant
ultimately.
there
was
an
illegal
arrest.
it
was
a
denial
of
a
right
to
subpoenas
where
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
compulsory
right
of
process.
there
was
a
refusal
of
the
court
to
desegregate
the
courtroom.
the
attitude
of
the
court
is
clear
from
the
record,
the
addressing
of
negroes'
by
their
first
name.
finally,
conviction
of
a
court
lacking
jurisdiction
and
the
major
point
in
this
case
which
is
the
conviction
of
the
defendant
on
illegally
seized
evidence.
first,
reversed
by
the
court
below
and
then
affirmed
by
the
court
below
which
admits
that
this
evidence
was
in
fact
illegally
obtained
so
that,
that
issue
was
not
here.
i
would
like
to
devote
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
question
because
i
think
it
could
be
built
within
less
time,
if
this
court
permits.
it's
elementary
to
the
court
of
mississippi
because
it
so
states
that
trial
by
a
court
lacking
jurisdiction
is
a
fundamental
denial
of
due
process.
it
also
raises
fourteenth
amendment
issues,
that
under
the
statute
of
mississippi
and
justice
of
the
peaces
or
jurisdiction
begins
with
the
lodging
of
an
affidavit
and
that's
in
accordance
with
1832
of
the
statutes.
in
accordance
with
1205,
he
is
required
to
send
all
original
papers
to
the
trial
court,
and
in
accordance
with
1200,
he
is
required
to
certify
that,
that
record
is
the
original
record.
in
this
instance,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
on
march
3,
1962.
he
was
held
overnight
in
jail
until
march
the
4th.
on
march
the
14th
he
had
a
hearing
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
whereupon
he
was
convicted.
the
only
affidavit
in
the
county
court,
the
trial
court,
whose
jurisdiction
is
dependent
upon
that
of
the
justice
of
the
peace's
court,
was
an
affidavit
filed
by
the
county
attorney
dated
march
the14th
which
neither
reflect
that
it
was
on
information
and
belief.
now,
obviously
put,
it
had
been
on
personal
knowledge.
so
that
under
the
law
of
mississippi
even
consistent
with
that
part
of
it
that
as
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction.
it
did
not
decide
the
jurisdictional
question.
actually
what
it
did
was
define
an
amended
affidavit
and
in
finding
an
amended
affidavit
based
on
certain
representations
of
counsel
which
were
not
confident
testimony.
it
did
so
in
violation
of
its
own
law
which
has
specific
requirements
for
amendment.
the
first
of
which
is
that
an
original
be
produced
or
the
individual
who
supplied
the
original
before
whom
it
was
executed
and
who
supplied
the
contents
in
answer
to
a
complaint,
testified
to
it
from
personal
knowledge.
by
some
processes
of
invalid
reasoning
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
requires
petitioner
to
prove
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
which
he
continually
objected,
so
that
we
raise
this
not
only
on
the
due
process
grounds,
but
also
that
the
reading
of
the
law
and
application
of
the
law
in
mississippi
which
is
in
violation
of
it's
own
statues,
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
it
is
indeed.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
the
other
one
is
somewhat
complicated
because
of
references
to
statutes.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said
that
there
was
an
amended
affidavit
in
this
case
upon
which
it
rested.
the
jurisdictional
question
itself
was
never
specifically
adjudicated.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
that
the
termination
of
an
amended
affidavit
apart
from
not
being
supported
by
the
record
is
not
consistent
with
its
own
laws.
it
is
not
consistent
with
its
own
statutes.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
moreover,
the
statutes
themselves,
requiring
these
original
papers
to
go
to
the
county
court,
that
in
itself
is
conclusive
of
the
fact
that
court
lacked
jurisdiction,
so
it
is
on
two
basis.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
it
held
that
an
amended
affidavit
did
exist
and
that
this
was
sufficient
to
support
the
proceedings
in
the
county
court.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
i
think
in
fact
they
did,
yes.
they
made
no
specific
reference
to
it,
but
that
would
have
to
be
the
process
i
assume,
l
would
say
by
reason.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
other
than
this
one?
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes,
there
are
cases
to
the
contrary
as
far
as
amendments
are
concerned.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
there
are
cases
--
all
cases
wherever
amendments
have
been
allowed,
it
required
original
affidavits.
there
is
--
this
is
a
thorough
research
of
mississippi
law.
the
only
case
where
it
has
not,
the
court
has
required
that
the
person
before
whom
the
affidavit
was
made
testified
to
its
execution
and
to
the
facts
that
--
as
to
the
facts
set
forth
therein.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes,
they
are.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
they
are
cited
in
the
brief.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes,
it
is.
now,
finally,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
at
first
reversed
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
conceding
that
there
had
in
fact
been
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
under
the
mississippi
constitution.
but
that
because
the
testimony
wherein
the
illegally
seized
evidence
was
brought
into
the
record
it
was
not
objected
to
a
the
specific
time
that
it
was
brought
into
the
record.
despite
this
procedural
rule
that
they
talk
about,
there
was
a
denial
of
fundamental
fairness
to
the
petitioner
and
i'm
talking
about
this
first
opinion
by
virtue
with
the
fact
that
this
evidence
was
the
only
corroborating
evidence
to
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
upon
--
following
the
suggestion
of
error
of
the
attorney
general.
it
was
through
the
first
opinion
and
filed
that
second
which
is
in
the
record
of
which
where
it
consistently
held
the
search
to
be
illegal.
it
went
on
to
determine
that
it
had
a
procedural
rule
requiring
that
your
objection
be
made
at
the
time
that
evidence
is
submitted.
it
departed
from
its
former
opinion
only
that
it
introduced
the
element
of
waiver
and
it
stated,
it
starts
on
page
243
and
continues
to
244.
now,
since
the
defendant
did
not
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
illegally
obtained
evidence
at
the
time
it
was
offered
he
had
waived
his
right
to
object
to
such
evidence
and
that
error
could
not
be
predicated
upon
it.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
no,
it
wouldn't
be
an
unreasonable,
well
i
say
it
is
unreasonable
in
application
here
and
if
the
rule
moreover
does
not
exist.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes,
there
are.
mississippi
cases,
you're
referring
mr.
justice
clark?
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
the
difference
in
the
cases
in
mississippi,
and
they
differ
from
those
that
are
cited
in
the
opinion
below,
is
that
where
they
have
adjudicated
fundamental
right
to
constitutional
questions
they
have
applied
the
same
rule
and
it
would
be
consistent
with
rule
applied
in
the
federal
court
that
where
there
was
plain
error
or
where
the
conviction
is
supported
by
the
illegal
evidence,
where
the
constitutional
and
infirmity
is
the
basis
the
whole
basis
for
the
conviction
then
it
has
reversed
in
instances
where
the
objection
was
made
at
the
end
of
the
case,
where
the
objection
was
made
--
where
no
objection
was
raised
at
all,
and
where
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
i'm
trying
to
argue
--
the
question
that
put
me
actually
ahead
of
myself,
i'm
arguing
this
on
two
basis.
first,
that
as
opposed
to
an
independent
adequate
state
ground
that
none
exists
in
this
case
because
first
it's
not
independent.
we're
dealing
with
primarily
a
federal
issue
which
i
haven't
had
time
to
devote
any
time
to
yet
and
secondly,
this
long
procedural
rule
that
they
talk
about
does
not
exist.
so
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
i
have,
and
they
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
length.
all
of
them
i
think
are
mentioned
but
i
think
briefly
i
can
go
in
to
them
because
i
can
take
them
in
order.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yeah,
generally,
i
can
say
that
they
are
distinguishable
on
three
basis.
there
are
those
cases
that
deal
with
the
question
of
probable
cause,
where
probable
cause
had
to
be
determined
and
which
the
court
under
its
own
opinion
says
is
the
reason
for
that
rule,
it's
a
procedural
rule
so
that
the
trial
won't
be
interrupted.
there
are
those
cases
where
the
objection
was
applied
on
non-constitutional
basis
where
the
objection
went
to
the
use
of
rebuttal
testimony
to
incompetent
testimony.
there
are
only
two
cases
in
mississippi
where
there's
a
constitutional
violation
clear
on
the
record
where
there
is
no
need
for
any
probable
cause
determination
and
that
is
brooks
and
henry
versus
state.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
court.
i'd
like
to
clarify
exactly
what
our
contention
is
in
this
regard
so
that
we
don't
be
--
so
that
we
are
held
to
abandon
either
a
due
process
or
an
equal
protection
argument.
it
is
our
contention
then
in
this
case,
the
objection
made
was
timely
and
apart
from
federal
law
which
i
hope
to
reach
but
may
not,
that
is
was
timely
under
mississippi
law.
although,
it
occurred
in
a
motion
or
directed
verdict
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
113
of
the
record
where
i'd
like
to
state
exactly
what
was
said.
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
warrant
having
been
issued
and
the
testimony
of
this
mr.
collins
on
the
stand
to
the
effect
that
after
he
had
placed
this
man
under
arrest
he
then
proceeded
to
go
and
search
his
car
and
clearly,
this
is
a
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
it
is
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
so
the
evidence
that
they
have
secured
against
this
defendant
is
illegal
and
unlawful.
that
in
such
a
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
implicit
in
which
is
the
fact
that
there
is
not
sufficient
competent
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
when
does
this
timely
objection
of
the
mississippi
law
which
is
stated
by
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
on
page
243.
it
has
been
a
long
established
procedural
rule
in
the
state
that
parties
prejudiced
by
the
introduction
of
inadmissible
evidence
are
required
to
object
to
its
admissibility
at
the
time
it
is
offered
so
that
the
trial
judge
may
determine
its
admissibility
before
it
is
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is
in
essence
the
same
as
the
federal
rule.
it
connotes
an
orderly
trial,
but
the
purposes
stated
by
the
court
below
is
so
that
it
will
go
--
it
will
not
go
to
the
jury
before
the
question
is
determined.
this
was
raised
before
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
even
though
it
was
raised
in
the
form
as
a
directed
verdict
and
i
think
it
clearly
objects
to
the
type
of
evidence
used.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes
sir.
i
don't
have
a
reference
handy,
but
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
it
has
been
renewed
and
preserved
all
the
way
up.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
it's
not
that
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
without
this
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
convict,
yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
there
was
identification
but
we
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
itself
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
without
this
evidence.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
no,
they
did
not
say
it
was.
they
merely
did
not
include
it
in
their
opinion.
as
soon
as
they
got
to
the
long
standing
procedural
rule
they
then
went
directly
to
waiver
and
i
would
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
in
petitioner's
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
in
arguments
for
motion
of
--
no,
direction
as
such
as
i
have
read
it
to
you,
as
it
appears
here.
i
might
add
that
it
was
overruled
immediately
and
when
it
was
sought
to
be
restated
at
the
end
of
the
trial
it
was
overruled
before
it
could
have
been
stated.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
immediately,
yes
it
was.
and
there
was
no
consideration
of
the
court
or
no
notice
of
court
as
to
where
and
the
record
clearly
indicated
that
it
was
never
in
the
court's
mind
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
there
was
argument
in
support
of
it
and
when
it
reached
the
point
where
they
said
we
move
for
a
directed
verdict,
the
next
colloquy
is
motion
overruled,
bring
the
jury
back.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
no.
there
was
no
argument
offered
and
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
at
the
end
of
the
trial
when
it
was
sought
to
go
into
again,
it
was
not
permitted
to
be
go
into
again
because
counsel
got
as
far
as
i
would
like
to
move
and
the
court
said
motion
overruled.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
this
is
my
argument
that
implicit
in
this
part
where
i
just
read
to
the
court
which
is
on
page
113
of
the
record,
is
the
unlawfulness
and
the
inadmissibility
of
the
evidence.
it
was
not
argued
if
i
understand
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
correctly,
there
was
no
argument,
in
addition
to
that
which
appears
on
113,
but
the
point
was
raised
and
was
argued
in
that
portion
of
the
motion
for
directed
verdict.
it's
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
this
particular
portion
of
it
appears
on
113.
it
starts
with
word
second.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
on
this
specific
motion?
except
as
i
said
it
was
sought
again
to
be
repeated
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes,
it
was.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
now
to
return
to
the
mississippi
point
which
i
would
like
to
clarify.
it
is
our
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
i
think
initially
a
directed
verdict,
but
a
motion
to
disregard
would
have
taken
care
of
that
point
alone,
because
our
contention
that
without
that
evidence,
the
remainder
of
the
evidence
was
sufficient.
so,
we
would
have
been
looking
for
a
directed
verdict,
but
it
took
the
place
of
a
motion
to
strike.
this
was
testimonial
evidence.
this
was
not
a
case
where
somebody
brings
in
exhibit
a
and
says,
i
offer
this
material
evidence
in
and
do
you
object
to
it?
this
is
something
that
can
be
only
elicited
during
the
course
of
testimony
and
until
the
police
chief
actually
got
to
the
point
where
he
talked
about
something
that
he
discovered
in
the
car
which
was
somewhat
along
in
his
description
of
how
the
thing
occurred
there
was
no
time
to
object
and
there
was
no
notice
on
the
part
of
counsel
as
to
what
was
coming.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
he
testified
as
to
exactly
how
it
was
done,
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
the
point
for
an
objection
in
and
as
i
colloquy
developed
could
not
be
pinpointed
until
he
got
to
the
point
where
he
had
discovered
something.
if
he
just
got
in
and
out
of
the
car,
we
don't
have
any
illegal
search
and
seizure
because
to
our
knowledge
we
don't
have
any
evidence.
for
all
we
knew
at
that
point
he
got
in
and
out
of
the
car.
i'm
talking
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
apart
from
the
facts
which
lead
to
that
and
pertaining
to
that
directly
is
our
contention
that
it
would
not,
because
under
mississippi
laws,
as
was
pointed
out
in
their
first
opinion
which
i
realized
was
withdrawn
and
i
shall
deal
with
it
in
a
minute.
the
court
considered
that
testimony
insufficient
because
it
was
not
collaborated.
now,
the
trial
court
apparently
was
the
same
opinion,
but
it
--
because
it
charged
the
jury
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
mississippi
to
the
same
effect.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
he
testified
to
all
of
that,
that
of
course
would
have
to
be
compared
with
his
original
statement
which
would
be
the
tape
recorded
statement
taken
by
the
county
prosecutor
pearson
and
on
a
comparative
basis
to
realize
from
the
record
how
some
very
general
details
began
to
be
explicit
testimony,
which
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
that
testimony
is
on
the
record.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
corroborate
--
the
case
was
based
on
identity
as
the
court
below
observed.
the
court
below
also
observed
that
up
until
then
his
testimony
was
fairly
general
and
it
was
only
this
evidence
which
could
support
his
statement
which
apparently
did
not
consider
insufficient
and
which
we
urge
is
insufficient
and
as
i
say
the
court
below
in
its
instructions
charged
that
without
this
corroborating
testimony
it
wouldn't
be
insufficient.
so
these
represent
the
law
of
mississippi
apart
from
anything
else.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
my
time
is
up.
i'll
try
to
deal
with
it
briefly
by
saying
that
the
cases
in
support
of
it.
mississippi
has
never
--
has
not
held
this
unless
there
has
been
an
explicit
agreement
of
counsel
or
unless
they
introduce
into
evidence
later
objected
to
has
been
initially
introduced
by
the
defendant
which
was
not
the
case
here.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
now
or
[inaudible]
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
[inaudible]
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
i
like
to
devote
myself
to
this.
i
think
i'm
going
to
have
to
limit
these
things
raised.
you
had
us
to
go
first.
i
didn't
have
time
to
mention
that
on
direct,
but
on
page
237
that
finding
that
there
is
a
proper
substitution
in
the
--
of
the
affidavit
with
regard
to
the
jurisdictional
point,
is
not
supported
by
the
record
and
we
would
refer
the
court,
the
testimony
regarding
that
which
is
on
156
and
157
of
the
record,
proper
and
we
contend
here
that,
that
finding
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
refutes
that
it
was
proper
and
the
court
entered
that
word
proper.
secondly
counsel
has
urged
that
there
was
an
agreement
as
to
substitution
of
this
amended
affidavit.
i
think
there
were
about
eight
or
nine
objections
made
to
that
amended
affidavit.
they
are
consistent
throughout
the
record
and
appear
on
53,
54,
56,
62,
63,
65,
66,
112,
and
182
of
the
record.
so,
i
think
that
substantially
takes
care
of
that.
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
clarified
that
point
on
the
law
of
mississippi
as
regard
to
requiring
cooperation.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
no,
there
is
nothing
that
disagree,
no
[inaudible]
in
one
of
them,
there
is
something
which
agrees
with
it.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
in
the
first
opinion.
it
is
not
refuted
in
the
second
opinion,
although
we
concede
it
is
not
included
in
the
second
opinion.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
it
is.
they
are
consistent
on
their
point.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
no
i'm
talking
about
the
instruction
to
the
court
which
i
can
find
for
you
on
page
187
of
the
record.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
that's
the
trial
court.
and
the
point
--
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
the
only
agreement
can
be
found
in
this
language
in
the
first
opinion
which
mr.
justice
stewart
just
remark
on.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
certainly,
i
want
to
point
out
with
regard
to
our
argument
as
to
jurisdiction
of
the
court
about
which
mr.
justice
brennan
acquired.
our
argument
is
not
limited
to
equal
protection
because
our
major
argument
has
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
which
is
a
due
process
argument
case.
ms.
barbara
a.
morris
and
then
finally,
there
is
set
for
what
i
think
a
detail
on
our
brief
the
fact
that
under
these
circumstances
where
fundamental
rights
are
involved.
there
is
also
the
under
the
line
of
bailey
decisions
that
even
insofar
as
back
williams
versus
georgia,
the
right
of
this
court
to
evaluate
the
case
and
to
determine
whether
these
--
whether
in
the
light
of
these
facts,
the
rule
applied
by
the
state
was
in
fact
consistent
with
the
constitutional
requirements.
