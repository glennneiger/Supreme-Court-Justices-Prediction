mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
on
the
subject
to
the
affidavit,
you
will
find
the
statement
in
the
record
and
it's
repeated
in
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
and
i
make
note
of
it
on
page
9,
i
believe
it
is
9,
at
the
top
of
the
page
there
a
very
short
brief
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant's
attorney
admitted
that
an
amended
affidavit
was
properly
substituted
for
the
original.
now,
that
having
been
done,
naturally
there
was
no
question
raised
along
the
route
anywhere
about
the
whereabouts
of
the
original
affidavit.
i'm
going
to
proceed
here
from
if
it
just
please
the
court.
after
conviction
as
appeal
in
a
trial
de
novo
and
these
books
certified
to
the
county
or
the
circuit
court
as
the
case
maybe,
all
the
papers
that
it
has
in
the
thing
and
in
this
case,
they
only
certified
up
the
amended
affidavit
the
one
upon
which
it
was
tried
and
very
logically
so
and
understandably
so.
and
when
they
started
looking
for
the
original
affidavit
nobody
could
find
it.
but
he
was
tried
on
the
amended
affidavit
which
was
furnished
to
counsel
which
was
taken
by
them
and
which
they
agreed
had
been
substituted
for
the
original.
so
that
amended
affidavit
even
if
there
were
no
other
or
even
if
it
were
faulty
give
it
to
full
jurisdiction.
admittedly,
there
was
an
unlawful
search
of
this
petitioner's
car
by
the
chief
police
of
clarksdale,
mississippi,
after
the
petitioner
had
been
put
in
jail
and
the
complaining
witness
had
related
his
story
in
order
to
nail
down
the
evidence
so
to
speak.
the
chief
police
went
to
the
petitioner's
home.
his
wife
came
to
the
door
and
he
asked
her
could
he
look
in
his
car.
the
car
was
locked
and
she
went
in
and
got
the
key,
gave
him
the
key
and
she
and
her
mother
and
father
and
her
daughter,
i
think
about
nine
years
old
came
out
there
and
they
watched
as
the
chief
police
unlocked
the
car
and
looked
in
and
corroborated
to
him
operable
condition
of
the
cigarette
lighter
the
complaining
witness
had
told
about.
he
had
also
stored
about
two
ash
trays
up
there,
one
on
the
driver's
side
and
one
on
the
passenger's
side,
and
the
one
on
passenger's
side
had
a
lot
of
red
chewing
gum
wrappers.
well
sure
enough
the
chief
reaches
over
and
it
had
bunch
of
empty
chewing
gum
wrappers
and
he
says
what
is
this?
and
there
his
little
daughter
speaks
up
and
says,
oh,
i
put
those
at
wednesday,
i
believe
she
said.
it
is
strongly
corroborated
of
the
mere
fact
that
the
boy
was
in
the
car
with
the
petitioner.
it's
not
essential
to
his
conviction
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
clark
mentioned
that
the
testimony
of
the
boy
himself
being
sufficient.
but,
of
course,
this
corroborate
help.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it's
not
necessary
mr.
justice.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no
sir,
not
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
that's
reflected.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
had
completely
forgotten
that
--
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
judge
hadn't
looked
it,
along
with
that
question
in
mind
because
it
wasn't
necessarily
involved
[inaudible]
except
indirectly,
i
don't
recall
that
they
said
anything
about
it
in
the
opinion.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that's
right.
so,
it's
not
necessary
--
the
corroboration
was
not
necessary.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
supreme
court
just
observed
that
the
trail
court
made
a
concession
to
the
appellant
to
which
he
was
not
entitled,
i
had
forgotten
that.
any
lawyer
that
has
had
any
trial
experience
knows
very
well
that
when
your
opposition
is
about
to
introduce
something
prejudicial
and
inadmissible
in
conflict
for
any
reason,
that
at
some
way
in
the
proceedings
either
in
some
states
or
in
federal
court
by
a
free
trial
motion
to
suppress
or
by
an
objection
at
the
time
the
testimony
is
offered,
that
to
preserve
the
point
on
appeal,
one
of
those
those
steps
has
to
be
taken.
no
objection
was
made.
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
something
i
felt
i
had
to
do
in
this
case.
i've
made
an
exhibit
to
the
brief
an
affidavit
to
the
district
attorney
who
prosecuted
this
case.
as
to
what
happened
in
the
courtroom,
and
i
feel
that
while
affidavits
have
no
part
in
a
brief
before
this
court.
i
feel
that
i'm
justified
in
this
--
the
light
of
this
particular
case
and
for
the
additional
reason
that
i
have
three
times
given
counsel
for
this
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
claim
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
have
to
make
some
timely
[inaudible]
objection.
i
believe,
i've
made
a
part
of
this
record
the
brief
that
i
filed
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court
on
subjection
of
error.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
reversed
his
conviction
because
of
the
non
[inaudible]
attorneys,
who
were
down
there
defending
him.
at
the
same
time,
completely
--
well,
in
fact
that
he
had
a
resident
attorney
with
vast
trial
and
appellate
experience.
he
also
had
that
robert
l.
carter,
who
is
well
known
to
this
court,
john
sandifer
of
new
york,
and
the
supreme
court
excused
their
failure
to
object
because
they
were
non-residents
and
not
familiar
with
the
technique
of
criminal
trials
in
mississippi.
well,
the
obvious
effect
on
that
--
of
that
in
future
cases
is
momentous.
it
wouldn't
paid
the
defendant
in
mississippi,
who
wouldn't
pay
and
hire
a
mississippi
lawyer
import
one
that
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing
and
you
get
an
automatic
reversible.
so,
i
finally
suggested
there
furnished
all
nine
members
of
the
court
with
a
copy
of
it
and
they
unanimously
sustained
it
and
reinstated
the
rule
that
you
got
to
make
the
timely
[inaudible]
objection
and
furthermore
in
this
case,
the
defendant
had
put
on
similar
testimony
that
the
principle
of
estoppel
work.
you
will
note
in
that
affidavit
and
the
--
to
say
you
justified
it
to
herein
situation.
in
that
suggestion
wherever
that
filed
concluded
by
offering
to
withdraw
it
or
confess
it
to
the
mississippi
court
of
right.
if
either
one
of
those
lawyers,
not
all
of
them,
but
either
one
of
them
would
file
a
simple
affidavit
that
he
didn't
know
that
if
sometime
in
the
proceedings
either
by
free
trial
motion
or
by
objection
one
offered,
i
would
confess
that
the
court
is
right.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
a
feeling
of
apology
but
have
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
opposition
and
in
the
argument
made
this
is
indictment
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
charges
--
this
is
another
instance,
in
other
words,
this
is
a
trumped
up
case.
i
don't
know
this
petitioner
personally,
i
know
by
reputation.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that
statement
was
prompted
by
some
information
that
i
received
recently,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
trail
made
--
made
through
that
i
had
the
other
--
that
he
didn't
do
things
like
this.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
it
occurred
to
me
if
that's
your
reaction
i'm
most
humbly
apologize
because
i
didn't
mean
such
a
thing
except
to
try
to
answer
the
indictment
that
this
pleadings
they
have
filed
against
the
state
of
mississippi,
that
this
was
a
framed
case
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes
sir.
[inaudible]
along
that
line
would
tend
to
my
mind
the
negative
idea
that
this
was
a
kind
frame
up.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
was
merely
trying
to
negate
the
charges
that
the
other
side
had
made
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i'm
not
certain
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
think
he
had
some
character
witnesses,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
as
i
recall,
there
were.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
oh,
then
and
rather
previous,
actually
this
time
you
know,
but
silent
on
that,
but
as
i
recall
he
did
have
some
routine
character
witnesses.
and
i
believe
his
wife
was
examined
along
that
with
investigators
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
of
course,
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial
there
your
honor.
i
certainly
could
have.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
i
or
anybody
else
did
poison
the
minds
of
this
honorable
court,
but
there
have
been
many
efforts
to
do
so
and
i
actually
feel
justified
in
that
innuendo
as
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
earlier,
when
by
this
there
are
much
greater
innuendos
and
outright
charges
of
fraud
on
the
part
of
state
of
mississippi
and
trumping
up
a
case
against
this
man
because
of
his
civil
rights
activities.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
i
feel
that
anybody
is
entitled
to
try
to
answer
a
charge
and
in
effect
to
try
relive,
to
some
extent
relieve
the
mind
of
the
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
about
my
word,
i
think
its
not
it's
a
--
if
that's
the
court
reaction
to
it,
i
appear.
i
humbly
apologize
and
now
ask
myself
that
it
would
be
stricken.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
for
a
second,
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
court
to
[inaudible]
i
wouldn't
try
to
poison
the
mind
of
this
court
because
it
can't
be
done.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that's
the
rule.
and
it's
firmly
entrenched
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
it's
re-announced
in
the
court's
opinion,
substituted
opinion
in
this
very
case.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that's
not
timely.
it's
got
to
be
raised
when
the
evidence
was
offered
and
i
say
it's
a
firmly
entrenched
your
honor.
we
do
have
a
case
and
it
was
primarily
on
that
case
that
justice
rogers
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
wrote
the
first
opinion
reversing
his
conviction.
it's
brooks
versus
state
in
which
case,
the
man
was
charged
with
serious
felony
and
even
though
he
had
a
lawyer,
the
lawyer
sat
there
like
one,
your
predecessors
said
as
a
funny
dummy
and
let
the
district
attorney
just
run
[inaudible]
over
him
and
violated
his
constitutional
rights
in
several
respects
without
an
objection.
well,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
a
case
like
this
said
that
was
so
fundamental
and
such
an
unusual
case,
and
in
like
so
many
other
cases
it
was
just
a
mockery
of
justice
and
there's
no
trial
integrity
as
such
that
the
supreme
court
would
reverse
without
any
objection,
had
of
them
been
made.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
did
so
in
that
case
i'm
talking
about
where
it
was
just
in
several
respects
the
defendant's
rights
were
just
completely
transferred.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
here
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case
and
it's
undeniable
and
i
say
i've
given
counsel
an
opportunity
three
times
to
deny
it,
if
something
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
that
the
failure
to
object
in
this
case
was
a
conscious
and
willful
failure
to
do
so
and
a
matter
of
strategy.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
of
course,
it
wouldn't
appear
in
the
record.
but
i
learned
that
that's
what
happened,
that
actually
at
the
trial,
one
of
counsel's
[inaudible]
arose
to
object,
the
district
attorney
was
expecting
an
objection.
the
other
counsel
robert
l.
carter
literally
pulled
him
down
by
his
coat
tail
and
they
let
it
go
in,
and
then
they
tried
to
disprove
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
sincerely
hope
so
in
the
case
of
this
kind
where
it
was
obviously
a
conscious
waiver.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
you
should
try
to
review
everything
that
come
before
you,
but
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but
where
you
find
that
there
was
a
conscious
waiver
for
the
right
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
you
can't
find
it
from
the
record
your
honor,
where
there
is
no
objection
made
into
the
record.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
there's
nothing
to
find
from.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
would
say
this,
if
no
objection
is
noted
in
the
record,
how
would
you
ever
know?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
if
it
saw
fit
not
to
do
so
after
the
evidence
were
delivered
and
let
in,
they
adopted
that
trial
strategy
backed
by
it
and
it's
too
late.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
[inaudible]
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that
--
the
position
of
this
very
court
and
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
i
believe
one
other
very
thing.
and
as
recently,
i
didn't
cite
that
case
in
the
brief,
but
as
recently
as
in
escobedo
versus
illinois,
this
very
thing
was
mentioned
in
that.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
a
conscious
waiver
by
a
counsel
of
a
--
the
right
to
raise
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
haven't.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
thought
i
didn't
think
though.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
in
addition
to
the
failure
to
object.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
when
the
testimony
was
out
--
we
have
and
that
i
think
it's
pretty
well
by
putting
a
general
rule
around
the
country.
and
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
should
be
the
rule
of
the
federal
court
that
where
one
side
introduces
it
as
evidence
either
in
a
civil
or
criminal
case
which
is
incompetent
and
inadmissible
for
some
reason,
but
no
objections
made
and
then
the
other
side,
when
they
put
on
their
case
going
to
the
same
matter
as
were
done
in
this
case,
this
inadmissible
evidence
was
a
testimony
of
the
chief
of
police
as
to
what
he
found
in
the
car,
the
inoperable
cigarette
lighter
and
the
chewing
gum
wrappers.
i
believe
petitioner's
wife
on
direct
examination
by
the
defense
was
also
asked
about
what
was
found
in
the
car?
they
said,
[inaudible]
and
they
put
a
garage
mechanic
on
to
testify
with
respect
to
petitioner
bringing
the
lighter
down
to
his
place
to
have
it
fixed
which
indicated
to
me
that
this
was
definite
strategy
that
they
knew
what
the
stated
--
the
cigarette
lighter
pretty
much,
and
then
later
to
disprove
it
by
showing
the
petitioner
had
taken
it
down
and
had
it
fixed.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
that
backfired
on
because
on
cross-examination
it
was
developed,
he
came
down
and
had
it
fixed
the
day
after
this
instance
occurred
[inaudible].
it
was
the
day
after.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
not
this
type
of
estoppel,
not
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
they
have
not.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
would
have
to
check
back
in
the
record
but
i
believe
the
first
motion
for
directed
verdict
was
made
at
the
conclusion
on
the
state's
case.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
that
ground
i
don't
believe
was
set
out
in
the
motion.

mr.

lyell,

mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
what
they're
trying
to
say
is
that
regardless
of
where
the
motion
might
have
been
made,
as
long
as
it
wasn't
conceivably
objected
to
when
offered
that
you
would
still
be
estopped
to
complain
if
you
went
on
and
put
same
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
except
there
is
a
matter
of
strategy
on
a
trial
strategy.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor
and
so
does
the
federal
court
and
one
of
the
briefs
--
and
of
the
cases
cited
in
this
brief,
i
believe
is
a
ninth
circuit
case,
where
it
was
sought
in
a
very
situation
like
this,
inadmissible
evidence
to
get
to
ninth
circuit,
i
believe
it
was
that
they
bid
under
the
plain
error
rule
and
reversed.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
