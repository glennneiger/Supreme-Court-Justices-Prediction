c.
clark
the
supreme
court
held
the
amended
affidavit
was
sufficient,

right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
must
have
interpreted
their

as
permitting
that,
could
that
be
true?
justice
tom
c.
clark
mississippi

and
there's
no
cases
to
the
contrary.

tom
c.
clark
yeah.
justice
tom
c.
clark
or
you
couldn't
make
an
amendment?
justice
tom
c.
clark

you
say
that

true,
if
they
imposed
in
other

they
departed
from

this
case.

other
argument

here
about
on
this
motion

didn't
in
the
second

say
that
they
would
have
stopped
a

justice
tom
c.
clark
the
idea
--
justice
tom
c.
clark

justice
tom
c.
clark
that
answer

in
your
state?
justice
tom
c.
clark
these
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
court
on

not
been
watered
down
in
any
way?
