justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
asking
for
a
directed
verdict
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
the
argument
that
without
it
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
to
convict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
not
my
point.
you
said
a
moment
ago
--
now
you
said
it
was
not
sufficient
evidence
on
which
conviction
could
have
been
had
without
adding
the
chewing
gum
and
wrap
around
to
the
fact
that
the
neither
you
were
[inaudible].
i
was
just
wondering,
which
page
is
find
the
testimonies,
the
reason
why
i
have
read
this
reference
that
reads
the
plaintiff
[inaudible]
and
picked
up
and
get
him
a
ride
and
it
was
[inaudible]
identified
this
party
as
defendant
was
being
remanded
from
the
act,
is
that
lead
sufficient?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
also
had
the
number
of
car,
did
they
get
it?
he
testified
to
all
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
thing
that
appeared
me
that,
that
was
corroboration,
it
was
ceded
that
it
was
determined
in
records
that
it
was
found
[inaudible]
and
the
back
[inaudible]
corroboration
of
course.
corroboration
if
this
was
a
car
[inaudible]
and
also
that
car
was
owned
by
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
your
rule
mississippi
rule
on
that
direct
corroboration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
necessary
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
judge
[inaudible]
say
about
that
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
neither
rule
for
me
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
[inaudible]
about
the
rule
with
reference
to
the
corroboration.
you
said
that
it's
the
rule
that
somewhere
during
making
the
objection,
somewhere
during
the
trial
before
the
case
goes
to
the
jury,
particular
objection
must
be
made
to
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
still
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand,
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
raised
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
by
his
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
a
discretion
in
the
court
where
it
can
waive
if
it
sees
fit
under
the
particular
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
that
it's
not
an
absolutely
written,
unbreakable,
irrevocable
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
court
can
waive
it,
if
the
circumstances
in
its
judgment
justify
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
a
constitutional
matter
at
this
time
that
this
was
--
this
might
come
under
special
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
court
should
be
bound
to
accept
as
a
rule,
a
purpose
of
its
position
of
this
court
of
a
constitutional
question.
the
fact
that
the
state
court
that
because
of
a
discretionary
rule
that
if
it
should
reply
or
not,
that
this
court
is
necessarily
bound
to
accept
that
exercise
of
discretion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
how
you
are
--
the
claim
is
that
we
should
accept
this
as
an
adequate
state
ground,
but
the
rule
is
not
an
irrevocable
rule,
not
intended
to
be,
somebody
has
to
weigh
the
circumstances.
do
you
think
that
we
should
accept
that
weighing
of
the
circumstances
without
reviewing
the
file
themselves?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
arguing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
we
would
find
--
we
should
find
from
the
record
itself
that
they
was
a
conscious
waiver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
go
beyond
the
record
to
find
it,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
is
an
objection.
it
was
made
at
the
time
before
the
case
submitted
and
on
the
rules
of
the
state,
under
the
state
law
that
allowed
the
court
to
consider
it
then
if
it
so
--
if
it
did
so,
that's
striking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
saw
fit
not
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
looked
up
our
cases
on
that
point
as
to
what
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
just
a
state
ground
where
it
is
the
discretionary
with
the
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
appellate
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
escobedo
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
a
conscious
waiver
by
counsel,
but
i
have
a
weak
[inaudible]
because
that's
weighing
the
circumstances.
have
you
looked
up
our
cases
as
to
whether
we
are
bound
to
accept
it
as
adequate
ground.
the
decision
of
court
from
the
facts,
the
application
of
rules
when
the
state
supreme
court
can
waive
that
rule
in
cases
it
sees
to
fit
waive
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
113.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
ground
of
the
motion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
one
other
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
in
my
judgments
along
the
way
that
mississippi
had
a
rule
that
it
could
always
notice
plain
error
that
could
cause
an
injury
justified?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
rule
in
mississippi?
