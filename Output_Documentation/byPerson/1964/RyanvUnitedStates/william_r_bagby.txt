mr.
william
r.
bagby
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justice
of
the
court,
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
an
act
of
congress
which
relates
to
examinations
and
investigations
of
taxpayers
by
the
commissioner
and
his
agents.
the
particular
part
of
the
act
of
congress
with
which
we
are
concerned
states
restrictions
on
examination
of
taxpayers.
no
taxpayer
shall
be
subjected
to
unnecessary
examination
or
investigation.
and
only
one
inspection
of
the
taxpayer's
books
or
accounts
shall
be
made
for
each
taxable
year,
unless
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
after
investigation
notifies
the
taxpayer
in
writing
that
an
additional
inspection
is
necessary.
the
precise
question
concerned
here
is
whether
this
act
of
congress,
this
section
of
the
statute,
requires
that
an
internal
revenue
agent
should
establish
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
district
court
that
a
reasonable
basis
suggest
for
a
suspicion
of
fraud
or
probable
cause
exist
to
believe
the
taxpayer
was
guilty
of
fraud
in
order
to
justify
the
enforcement
of
a
summons
issued
by
the
agent
to
the
taxpayer
to
produce
his
books
and
records
and
testify
for
years
which
are
barred
by
all
statutes
of
limitations
and
open
only
in
the
event
of
fraud.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
the
taxpayer,
bayard
edward
ryan
of
maysville,
kentucky
filed
timely
his
federal
income
tax
returns
for
the
years
1942
to
1953
inclusive,
and
reported
a
sizable
amount
of
income
for
those
years.
an
examination
began
by
a
revenue
agent
of
the
commissioner
sometime
in
1960
of
the
returns
for
1954
to
1958.
at
the
time
i
believe
of
the
hearing
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
cincinnati,
the
case
for
the
years
1954
to
1958
had
been
settled.
the
agent
thereupon
began
investigation
of
the
years
1942
to
1953
and
issued
a
summons
requiring
the
taxpayer
to
produce
the
records
for
those
years
and
to
appear
and
testify.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
when
we
stopped
i
had
stated
that
the
taxpayer
had
received
the
summons
from
the
revenue
agent
and
he
appeared
--
but
did
not
produce
his
books
on
the
advice
of
counsel
on
the
basis
that
the
assessment
of
the
taxes
had
been
barred
by
all
statutes
of
limitations
except
by
fraud
and
he
requested
on
the
advice
of
counsel
that
some
indication
be
made
of
the
existence
of
fraud.
thereupon
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court,
in
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky,
and
the
agent
alleged
that
the
taxpayer
had
the
books
and
records
for
the
years
1942
to
1953
in
his
possession
and
that
the
agent
had
made
an
estimate
of
the
network
assets
of
the
taxpayer
and
therefore
there
was
a
strong
suspicion
of
fraud.
the
basis
apparently
of
the
complaint
was
that
the
examination
was
relevant
and
material
through
his
examinations
for
the
years
involved,
1942
to
1953.
the
taxpayer
filed
an
answer
alleging
that
the
books
and
records
for
all
the
years
involved
were
not
in
existence
and
that
neither
were
the
filed
income
tax
returns
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
itself
ever
so
often
orders
the
destruction
of
individual
income
tax
returns.
the
trial
was
held
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
took
the
position
and
made
the
ruling
that
there
was
an
automatic
and
arbitrary
right
of
the
agent
to
have
the
books
and
records
of
the
taxpayer
for
the
years
1942
to
1953
irrespective
of
fraud.
he
held
that
fraud
was
not
a
matter
of
concern
because
the
statute
7602,
gave
the
agent
the
automatic
right
to
any
books
and
records.
at
the
trial
of
the
case
however,
it
was
showed
that
--
it
was
proved
that
the
books
and
records
for
the
years
1942
to
1946
were
not
in
existence
and
part
of
the
books
for
1947
and
1948
were
not
in
existence.
and
that
--
it
was
further
revealed
that
the
income
tax
returns
themselves
for
the
years
1942
through
1950
were
no
longer
in
existence
and
that
the
only
returns
in
existence
were
those
for
1951,
1952,
and
1953.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
year
1945
had
been
checked
and
the
report
filed
in
1948,
none
of
the
other
years
apparently
had
ever
been
examined.
the
holding
of
the
district
court
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
court
gave
that
there
are
no
consideration,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
was
the
order
as
rendered
by
the
court,
and
the
ruling
during
the
trial
was
that
irrespective
of
the
fact
the
returns
were
not
in
existence
and
irrespective
of
the
books
the
order
should
be
that
it
would
cover
all
books
and
records.
the
court
apparently
did
not
give
any
consideration
at
all
to
section
7605
(a)
or
(b),
(b)
being
the
requirement
that
the
examination
be
necessary
or
putting
it
the
other
way
that
an
examination,
an
unnecessary
examination
should
not
be
made.
they
gave
no
consideration
whatsoever
to
that
part
of
the
statute,
but
followed
strictly
section
7602
which
said
that
an
examination
could
be
made.
the
books
could
be
had
if
the
examination
were
relevant
to
the
books
and
records.
and
it
goes
--
it
appears
to
go
without
saying
that
any
examination
for
an
in
--
for
a
year
of
taxes
that
the
books
would
be
relevant
to
that
examination.
actually
that
leads
in
to
the
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
no.
your
honor,
there
is
not
in
this
case
involved
a
--
any
criminal
offense
of
any
kind
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
only
question
involved
is
whether
the
agent
has
the
right
to
these
books
and
records
for
the
years
involved
where
the
statute
of
limitations
have
expired.
now
you
have
two
statutes
of
limitations,
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
which
is
ordinary
expiration.
you
also
have
the
six-year
statute.
during
the
six-year
period
after
return
is
filed,
the
government
may
set
up
additional
income
if
the
taxpayer
has
omitted
25%
of
his
income
shown
in
his
return.
the
--
there's
also
the
six-year
statute
for
criminal
prosecution
and
we
don't
have
that
here
involved,
but
it
appears
that
the
government
has
argued
in
its
brief
that
by
not
allowing
the
agent
to
have
these
books
and
records
for
these
years
that
we
are
restricting
him
unnecessarily
because
that's
when
he
needs
the
greatest
ability
to
get
to
the
facts
about
the
taxpayer's
income.
however,
they
threw
together
the
fact
that
they
said
in
their
brief
that
criminal
and
civil
while
the
constitution
itself
or
the
fifth
amendment
gives
the
taxpayer
the
privilege
if
he
feels
a
prosecution
is
eminent
and
he
has
committed
a
fraud,
he
has
the
privilege
to
keep
his
books
and
records
and
refuse
to
give
them
to
the
government
agent.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
if
you
--
the
district
court
in
doing
the
trial
stated
that
even
though
the
books
and
records
were
not
in
existence
that
didn't
deter
the
agent
from
making
a
demand
and
bringing
the
taxpayer
into
court
and
receiving
an
order.
we
objected
to
the
order
on
the
grounds
that
it
should
not
have
covered
the
years
during
which
there
were
no
books.
but
the
court
said
that
--
at
a
later
time
when
the
agent
made
the
request
for
the
books
then
it
--
there
was
a
chance
--
the
opportunity
to
say,
“well,
i
don't
have
those
books
and
therefore
i
can't
comply.”
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well,
i
would
say
it
would
your
honor.
section
7602
is
the
one
which
gives
the
agent
the
power
to
secure
the
books
and
it
was
incorporated
in
the
law
prior
to
7605.
7602
apparently
created
--
a
bit
of
a
trouble
because
of
the
fact
that
at
that
time
there
were
some
agents
who
were
apparently
taking
advantage
of
this
great
power
which
the
agent
had
of
bringing
in
the
taxpayer
and
ordering
him
to
bring
in
his
books.
thereupon
congress
receiving
a
great
many
letter
complaints
from
taxpayers
throughout
the
country
and
must
be
realized
that
this
is
in
the
early
stages
of
the
income
tax
law
and
that
1921,
the
court
--
the
congress
passed
this
statute
which
said
that
the
examinations
should
not
be
made
of
the
taxpayers'
books
unless
there
were
some
necessity.
the
words
of
the
congress
were
that
no
taxpayer
should
be
subjected
to
an
unnecessary
examination.
now
this
section
was
passed
because
of
the
complaints
of
taxpayers
to
the
congress.
and
obviously
the
congress
had
probably
discussed
the
matter
of
protecting
taxpayers
with
the
commissioner.
and
normally
under
the
7602,
the
restriction
of
an
agent
would
be
by
administrative
treatment
that
is
if
the
taxpayer
had
a
complaint
he
would
take
it
up
or
perhaps
pay
now
to
the
district
director
or
with
the
commissioner
himself.
but
that's
a
rather
slow
process
and
the
congress
realized
that
the
taxpayer
wanted
real
protection.
he
had
to
be
protected
right
at
the
time
that
the
agent
knocked
at
the
taxpayer's
front
door.
so
the
congress
passed
this,
section
7605
to
give
the
taxpayer
the
protection
that
he
needed.
now
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
it's
absolutely
superfluous,
it's
unnecessary
because
the
government
agent
already
had
the
authority
to
demand
the
books
through
7602.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well,
the
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
--
there
is
the
possibility,
although
i
would
not
agree
with
that
possibility
because
that
is
the
position
taken
by
the
government
that
this
was
designed
to
prevent
and
protect
the
taxpayer,
suppose
you
say,
from
repetitious
examinations.
i
think
that
that
was
the
main
moving
factor
in
causing
the
congress
to
write
this
into
law.
but
the
--
like
itself
says
that
there
shall
not
--
the
taxpayer
shall
not
be
subjected
to
unnecessary
examination
or
investigation.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
in
any
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
you're
right
your
honor,
but
then
you
go
ahead,
you'll
notice
that
the
word
inspection
is
used
and
shall
not
be
--
he
shall
be
subjected
only
one
inspection
of
his
books.
now
the
words
examination
and
investigation
in
the
ordinary
parlance
mean
or
the
--
of
the
whole
millrun
of
this
examination
by
an
agent
from
the
time
he
gets
the
return
to
make
the
examination.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
if
it
were
during
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
no
your
honor
it
would
not
for
this
reason.
that
under
7602,
the
agent
and
the
commissioner
are
authorized
to
examine
the
books
for
purposes
of
verification.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
good
point
because
it
gets
--
we
get
to
the
--
this
position.
the
backbone
of
the
federal
income
tax
laws
is
the
self-assessment.
each
taxpayer
assesses
himself
and
the
congress
wants
to
encourage
and
protect
the
taxpayer
in
this
self-assessment.
you
--
to
encourage
this
self-assessment
the
agent
is
authorized
to
go
out
and
verify
the
returns,
and
that's
his
purpose
during
the
open
years
is
to
verify
the
return,
to
examine
the
return
to
see
if
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
taxpayer's
books.
now
after
the
open
years
it's
a
different
situation.
you
have
the
statute
of
limitations
which
bars
the
collection
of
the
tax,
and
unless
there
is
fraud,
unless
there
is
suspicion
of
fraud
that
is,
there
could
be
no
reason
to
make
an
examination.
during
the
open
years
they
have
the
reason
that
under
this
self-assessment
system,
not
only
the
taxpayer
should
welcome
an
examination
because
they
often
get
an
overpayment,
get
a
refund.
and
the
government
of
course
gets
--
collects
taxes
where
there
are
errors
in
the
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
but
after
the
years
are
barred
when
the
years
are
only
open
by
fraud,
it
seems
that
there'd
be
no
reason
to
make
an
examination.
and
i
think
the
statute
of
limitations
itself
in
this
particular
act
7605
is
to
encourage
and
push
the
agents
into
making
the
examinations
during
the
open
years.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
--
it
has
a
--
i
don't
believe
i
understand
the
question
sir.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
oh,
i
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
indeed
yes,
indeed
yes
your
honor.
he
is
authorized
to
make
an
examination
in
case
of
fraud.
and
i
think
even
the
government
has
in
its
brief
said
where
fraud
is
present
well
he
more
or
less
assume
that
there's
a
situation
which
requires
an
examination
of
fraud.
now,
it
seems
that
in
that
line
of
thinking
that
why
would
the
commissioner
or
a
district
director,
send
out
an
agent
after
the
years
are
barred
except
by
fraud
to
make
an
examination
unless
he
had
some
indication
that
there
was
fraud.
now
this
would
not
affect
the
examination
or
investigation
by
the
government
at
all
because
if
there
is
any
seed
at
all
in
the
hands
of
the
agent
or
the
commissioner
it's
just
simply
not
to
go
into
court
and
show
it.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
it
would
your
honor,
it
would.
and
i
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
passing
this
act
and
having
the
statute
of
limitations
that
after
this
statute
has
barred
the
years,
the
taxpayer
should
have
some,
as
the
congress
has
said,
some
piece
of
mind.
he
should
have
some
rest
from
there
on
out.
and
in
that
particular
situation
the
congress
itself
orders
the
destruction
of
the
income
tax
returns
periodically.
now,
if
they
had
anticipated
that
they
wanted
a
spot
check
as
a
routine
thing,
years
would
be
barred
except
open
by
fraud
and
that
--
and
one
must
not
forget
that
we
have
the
six-year
statute
put
as
open,
but
there's
a
25%
omission.
this
is
beyond
that
where
the
years
are
barred
except
by
fraud
that
the
congress
itself
has
destroyed
the
returns,
i
believe
up
through
5th
--
1955,
well
that's
eight
years
from
this
particular
period
now,
not
from
this
case
involved.
therefore,
they
themselves
revealed
an
intent
that
there
should
not
be
spot
checks
because
it's
a
waste
of
the
government's
money
to
go
out
and
make
spot
checks
unless
they
have
some
in
hand
to
show
fraud.
because
there
again,
the
congress
has
placed
upon
the
government
a
burden,
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
case
of
fraud
penalty.
it's
the
--
and
the
taxpayer
during
the
years
that
are
open
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
that
the
agent
is
wrong.
and
there
again,
you
have
the
purpose
of
encouraging
and
pushing
agents
into
making
an
examination
during
the
open
years
so
that
the
taxpayer
can
after
the
six
years,
the
honest
taxpayer
may
sit
down
and
not
worry
so
much
about
his
records
that
he
might
sleep
in
peace.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
--
you
mean
the
statute
itself?
i
guess
i
did
not
your
honor.
i
believe
the
government
did
in
its
brief.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
think
the
government
has
in
its
brief
printed
the
section
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
it's
in
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
they
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
--
a
practical
result
of
the
government
is
not
getting
these
books
would
be
that
they
would
not
--
if
they
wanted
the
books
they'll
probably
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
reveal
some
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
a
judicial
hearing.
to
reveal
some
fact,
some
reasonable
basis
to
show
that
there
was
some
indication
of
fraud
for
the
years
1942
to
1953.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
would
be
in
the
district
court
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
yes,
if
they
could
get
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
examination
--
there
is
one
examination
began
in
1960
and
the
years
1948
or
1954
to
1958
were
examined
first,
and
then
after
that
examination
was
finished
then
a
ten-day
letter
was
issued
by
the
agent.
he
and
another
agent
appeared
at
the
doorway
of
the
taxpayer
to
ask
for
the
books
for
1950
--
for
1942
to
1953.
the
years
1954
to
1958
had
long
ago
been
settled
and
we're
only
involved
with
the
barred
years.
and
this
is
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
for
the
--
barred
for
the
statute
of
limitations
and
open
only
by
fraud.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
they're
not
barred,
that's
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
you're
right
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
government
can
go
back
to
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
precisely.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
yes
your
honor,
they
could.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
of
course
if
they
had
some
seeds
of
thought,
some
reasonable
basis,
some
fact
in
the
courts
which
have
been
hearing
these
cases
are
not
been
very
demanding
in
their
requirements
as
to
how
much
proof
there
should
be.
and
i
think
leaving
it
up
to
the
district
courts
they
will
solve
this
problem
where
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
no
sir,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
he
would.
if
he
were
an
honest
taxpayer
particularly,
he
wouldn't
want
his
books
examined
if
he's
been
honest.
and
of
course
in
this
particular
case
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
he
should
be
free,
that's
under
this
inter
--
(inaudible)
interpretation
of
the
statute.
he'd
be
--
should
be
free
from
further
bothered
--
bothered
by
an
agent
after
the
years
are
barred.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
indeed
they
have,
and
your
honor,
this
one's
a
further
factor
i
might
add.
let's
assume
that
the
government
couldn't
get
the
books
of
a
taxpayer
who
perhaps
was
dishonest.
they
can
send
a
statutory
notice
and
have
a
trial
in
the
united
states
tax
court
and
issue
him
a
subpoena
and
he
has
to
then
bring
his
books
to
court,
and
at
that
time
the
agent
will
have
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
books.
so
that
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
they'd
have
the
right
to
subpoena
the
books
and
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
--
and
get
the
books.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
precisely.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
they
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
government
has
to
have
some
reasonable
basis.
if
they
have
that
they'd
have
--
they'd
be
now
--
having
the
position
to
get
the
books
before
the
district
court,
there
would
be
no
delay
anyway.
of
course
if
they
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well
that
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well,
presuming
that
they
had
some
basis
and
the
court
didn't
recognize
it,
then
they,
thereupon
send
out
a
statutory
notice.
if
the
commission
sends
a
statutory
notice
and
the
taxpayer
filed
a
petition
over
the
tax
court
and
the
case
was
set
down
for
trial,
of
course
the
government
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
would
have
the
right
to
subpoena
the
books
and
bring
them
into
court.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
fraud.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
in
order
to
get
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
--
the
tax.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
--
to
make
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
no
your
honor,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
unless
they
have
some
basis
sir.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
you
probably
would
have
a
privilege
of
a
pleading
of
the
fifth
amendment
but
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
you
have
that
here,
that's
right,
but
you
wouldn't
have
it
before
the
grand
jury
if
they
were
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
in
some
instance
that's
true.
in
most
instances
of
this
kind,
this
type
of
a
case,
the
government
sets
up
a
net
worth
and
most
of
the
proof
is
by
reason
of
third
party
records.
now,
we
don't
have
the
problem
of
third
party
here
which
we
find
in
some
cases.
they
can
get
the
records
of
third
parties
to
establish
net
worth
and
it's
obvious
here
that
that's
the
basis
on
which
they
were
claiming
that
there
was
a
case.
that
they
were
seeking
--
they
sought
third
party
records.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
no.
the
--
he
is
not
your
honor.
he's
entitled
to
a
lawyer
yes,
but
it
won't
necessary
follow
that
he
will
have
a
lawyer
because
very
often
an
agent
will
arrive
at
the
door
of
the
taxpayer
and
ask
for
the
books,
and
of
course
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer.
but
the
agent
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
he
has
the
right
to
counsel,
the
commissioner
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
commissioner
in
those
--
well,
recognized
agents
will
say,
"you
have
the
right
to
counsel
particularly
in
a
case
of
a
fraud
case".
if
a
fraud's
involved
they
will
say,
“well,
you
have
the
right
to
counsel.”
and
they
will
usually
forewarn
the
taxpayer
that
whatever
he
says
will
be
used
against
him
at
a
later
time
of
the
trial,
and
that's
particularly
true
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well,
they
can
take
him
in
private.
they
don't
--
there's
no
reason
to
have
a
--
there's
no
--
he
has
no
right
to
an
open
hearing
and
he
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
the
only
way
he'd
have
a
right
to
an
open
hearing
would
be
to
refuse
his
--
to
give
the
tax
--
the
agent
his
books,
and
then
the
process
is
that
the
agent
goes
in,
files
a
complaint
asking
the
district
court
for
an
order
to
require
the
taxpayer
to
bring
in
his
books.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
that
would
be
an
open
hearing.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
he
would
not.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
not
required
the
government
to
prove
fraud
but
to
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
--
to
prove
some
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
you're
right
your
honor.
i
say
that
that's
enough
--
not
enough.
in
this
particular
case
they
agent
said
that
he
had
a
tentative
net
worth
of
assets.
well,
that
really
means
nothing
because
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
would
say
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
would
say
that's
right
that
they
had
--
someone
had
the
opinion
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
finding
fraud
and
that
i
won't
say
that
they
had
a
reasonable
basis
because
there
we
never
--
i
never
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
the
agent
any
questions
that
would
lead
the
court
to
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
congress
in
7605
having
passed
it
after
7602
had
its
run
for
two
or
three
years
and
they
said
that
no
tax
--
this
was
entitled
restrictions
upon
examination.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well,
the
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
think
the
--
that
combined
that
you
must
put
that
in
the
whole
sphere
of
the
income
tax
law.
you
have
this
7605
which
says
the
taxpayer
shall
not
be
subjected
to
an
unnecessary
examination.
now,
that
must
mean
more
than
something
just
that
the
examination
of
these
books
of
this
taxpayer
is
relevant
to
the
agent's
examination.
that
must
mean
something
more
than
that.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well
that's
merely
an
expression,
an
opinion
of
the
agent
without
any
basis
of
facts
for
it.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
and
the
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
we
feel
that
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
--
these
other
factors
the
govt
--
the
congress
ordering
the
destruction
of
the
income
tax
returns.
and
this
whole
system
of
self-assessment
is
based
upon
the
honesty
of
the
ordinary
taxpayer.
and
i
think
the
statistics
show
that
the
average
taxpayer
wants
to
be
honest
and
he
is
honest.
and
the
purpose
of
this
interpretation
is
fitted
into
the
picture
of
the
statute
of
limitation
is
to
give
the
taxpayer
some
protection
from
a
personal
motive
on
the
part
of
the
agent.
and
in
this
particular
case,
we
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
show
the
personal
motive.
we
made
an
offer
of
certain
indictments
with
respect
to
a
man
the
name
of
kimble.
mr.
kimble
had
been
indicted.
mr.
kimble's
brother
lived
next
to
the
examining
agent
in
louisville.
louisville
and
maysville
are
fairly
far
apart.
we
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
show
a
personal
motive.
i
think
the
reason
you
have
here
you
say
an
unnecessary
examination.
it's
almost
impossible
to
show
a
personal
motive
on
the
part
of
an
agent.
and
unless
you
say
that
the
agents
must
show
some
reasonable
basis,
you
make
it
impossible
to
show
that
there
is
a
personal
motive.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
to
that
extent
your
honor
that's
correct
that
if
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
sir?
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well,
the
limiting
--
the
trial
solely
to
the
fact
of
--
that
there's
no
reasonable
basis
to
make
the
examination.
that
in
itself
would
eliminate
any
prolonged
trial
if
we
file
this
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
at
their
--
all
they
had
to
do
is
take
the
form
and
sign
their
name.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
not
necessarily.
they
can
issue
a
summons
on
their
own
without
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
--
taking
it
up
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
don't
think
there
is
if
--
during
the
examination
they
have
the
authority
to
go
out
and
in
this
particular
case,
they
issued
the
summons,
i
think
the
next
day
after
they
made
the
demand
for
the
books.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
yes,
he
is
as
far
as
the
summons
is
concerned.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
any
agent
may
issue
a
summons.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
not
in
the
76
--
oh!
yes,
under
7602,
he
may
issue
the
summons.
under
7605
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
if
he's
asking
for
an
inspection
of
the
books
for
the
second
time
then
he
has
to
get
the
commissioner's
authorization
to
request
those
books.
and
then
the
commissioner
as
an
ordinary
practice
writes
a
letter
to
the
taxpayer
requesting
a
second
inspection
of
the
books.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
on
1945
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
government
itself
didn't
realize
that
there
haven't
been
that
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
and
then
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
he
didn't
say
he's
made
a
net
worth
computation
your
honor.
he
said
that
he
had
--
i
believe
his
words
were
that
he
had
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
for
these
years
he
had
made
a
tentative
net
worth
of
the
assets.
so
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
--
relative
only
to
the
net
worth
assets.
now,
the
assets
without
liabilities
doesn't
mean
anything
at
all.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
well,
that's
very
possible
that
he
would
see
in
1954
to
1958.
however
the
years
1954
to
1958
were
settled
irrespective
of
any
claim
of
fraud
for
the
prior
years
then
were
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
precisely.
now
you
also,
as
i
say
had
the
liabilities
and
you
--
as
you
have
said,
you'd
have
returns
to
compare
this
increase
in
net
worth.
an
increase
in
net
worth
is
the
important
item.
it's
simple
enough
for
an
agent
to
come
in
and
set
forth
a
net
worth,
but
for
an
agent
to
say
this
has
a
net
worth
assets
means
nothing,
because
you
have
to
show
a
net
worth
--
an
increase
in
the
net
worth
during
the
years
over
and
beyond
what
has
been
reported
in
the
returns
for
the
respective
years.
in
this
particular
case
the
agent
didn't
even
have
the
returns.
the
returns
for
the
years
1942
to
1950
are
not
in
existence.
the
years
for
1951,
two
and
three
were
in
existence
but
the
prior
years
were
not.
therefore,
it
would
appear
that
he
couldn't
have
had
any
reasonable
basis
to
suspect
fraud.
here,
he
didn't
have
to
retained
returns.
he
didn't
had
the
file
returns,
that
is
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
been
destroyed.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
yes.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
right.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
think
it
is
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
the
district
courts
are
going
to
go
off
the
leading
path
too
far
in
demanding
that
the
government
proved
there
were
cases
of
fraud.
they
will
hear
the
case
and
receive
as
a
minimum
amount
of
facts
to
satisfy
them
that
there's
not
any
personal
motive
involved.
that
there
is
some
small
basis
for
a
belief
that
this
taxpayer
has
committed
fraud
and
that
is
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
honest
taxpayers
from
a
personal
grudge
and
to
let
this
thing
rest
after
so
many
years
that
congress
itself
destroying
the
returns.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
would
say
that
that's
--
you're
very
right.
this
of
course,
you're
dealing
here
with
a
problem
which
involves
every
person
practically
in
the
united
states.
you
have
a
problem
here
that
concerns
every
taxpayer
and
that's
most
of
us
in
the
country
and
in
the
other
you're
not
dealing
with
very
many
people.
it's
a
limited
number
of
people
applying
from
year
to
year.
income
taxes
are
something
that
we
have
with
us
constantly
every
minute.
here,
we
have
the
current
year
then
we
have
the
next
year
and
it's
a
matter
of
applying
to
a
great
millions
of
people
who
you
find
do
worry
about
whether
or
not
they
made
some
small
error
in
their
returns
which
someone
may
feel
destroyed.
i
think
this
broad
application
to
millions
of
people
would
justify
requiring
that
some
showing
be
made
and
perhaps
a
little
more
of
a
showing
than
there
is
in
the
case
as
you
suggested
about
a
search
warrant.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
thank
you
sir.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
add
a
word
or
two.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
connection
with
the
complaint
which
was
filed
by
the
agent
to
which
he
subscribed.
he
said
there
was
a
basis
for
fraud,
but
in
this
complaint
he
also
said
that
the
taxpayer
had
all
of
his
books
and
records.
and
yet
during
the
hearing,
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
never
asked
the
taxpayer
for
his
books
and
records
and
apparently
did
not
know
whether
or
not
they
all
existed.
another
point
to
which
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
--
reveal
is
that
the
first
part
of
7605
states
that
an
examination
shall
be
at
a
reasonable
time
and
place.
this
is
for
the
protection
of
the
taxpayer
and
is
a
part
of
the
whole
picture
in
which
this
unreasonable
examination
and
investigation
must
be
placed.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
not
only
that
your
honor
but
the
fact
that
the
interpretation
of
--
under
--
of
this
clause,
7605
(b)
requires
that
the
government
reveal
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
some
facts
revealing
a
reasonable
basis,
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that
there
is
a
suspicion
of
fraud.
we
--
mr.
william
r.
bagby
sir?
mr.
william
r.
bagby
i
would
say
that
fairly
well
covers
it
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
yes,
during
the
trial
we
were
your
honor,
because
the
court
believed
that
all
the
agent
need
to
do
is
to
show
that
he
was
making
an
examination
for
these
years.
and
therefore,
everything
was
relevant
and
material
to
that
examination.
and
he
said
fraud
or
no
fraud
irrespective
of
that
that
we
must
show.
he
said
that
we
must
show
that
the
agent
was
wrongful.
however,
we
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
because
he
felt
that
the
agent,
as
he
in
his
words
said,
an
agent
has
the
right
to
stop
the
first
person
that
he
sees
on
the
street
and
demand
and
get
his
books
and
records.
mr.
william
r.
bagby
that
is
one
of
our
positions,
it's
correct.
although
we
haven't
developed
that
as
much
as
we
could've
if
we'd
had
more
evidence
to
show
further
bad
faith,
and
then
pointing
it
out
here
the
fact
that
the
agent
had
said
in
his
complaint
that
all
of
the
books
and
records
existed.
and
during
the
trial,
a
very
meager
colleague
we
had
he
said
that
he
did
not
--
he
had
not
asked
the
taxpayer.
i
--
perhaps
i'm
missing
the
--
we
do
not
feel
that
we
had
a
reasonable
hearing
on
the
basis
that
the
court
believed
that
all
the
agent
had
to
do
is
ask
for
the
books
and
records.
thank
your
honor.
