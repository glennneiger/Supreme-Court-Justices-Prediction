justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
you
say
that
to
get
the
post-statute
examination
there
must
have
been
an
investigation
in
some
suspicion
of
fraud.
for
conceding
that,
you
also
say
however
that
when
you
go
--
when
you
want
--
when
the
agent
wants
to
enforce
the
order
he
must
show
not
only
that
there
was
an
investigation.
and
if
they
do
have
a
suspicion
of
fraud
which
has
been
confirmed
by
his
superior
but
that
he
must
reveal
the
facts
upon
which
that
judgment
is
based.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
you
say
that
the
mere
assertion
by
the
agent
that
--
well
we
have
investigated,
we
do
suspect
fraud
therefore
we
want
the
books.
you
say
that
isn't
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
clear
from
this
record
that
the
agent
or
someone
had
investigated
it
and
that
they
did
suspect
fraud,
and
that
one
of
his
superiors
had
ordered
him
to
get
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
much
is
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
made
you
to
believe
that
the
(inaudible)
statute
requires
anymore
than
this
assertion
that
we
have
investigated
and
we
do
suspect
fraud?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
that
--
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
perfectly
--
it
requires
something
other
than
what
is
required
before
the
statute
has
run
if
you
require
the
agent
to
assert
that
he's
investigated
and
he
suspect
fraud?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
what
ground
is
there
to
--
in
7605,
to
show
that
something
beyond
that
assertion
is
required?
certainly
the
assertion
may
be
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
--
my
--
i
would
assume
that
it
does.
at
least
it
assumes
that
at
least
that
the
government
must
come
in
and
say,
“this
isn't
just
relevant
but
we've
investigated
and
we
suspect
fraud.
we
think
there's
a
reasonable
grounds
for
fraud
your
honor.”
now
you
say
that
is
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
an
agent
isn't
an
authorized
representative
of
the
commissioner
for
this
purpose,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
particular
agent?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
--
show,
i
suppose,
that
you
had
made
an
investigation
that
had
arrived
to
at
least
a
suspicion
of
fraud,
it
may
not
have
to
go
to
farther
but
wouldn't
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
routine
though
that
your
agent
--
the
agent
does
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
against
fraud.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
that
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
he
would
decline
to
testify
as
to
what
the
grounds
for
suspicions.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
he
could
be
able
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
effect
of
the
time
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
the
date
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
he
--
having
the
court
to
answer
the
summons
on
the
tax
or
the
--
you
ask
the
taxpayer
for
his
books
and
he
says,
"no,
you're
going
to
court."
and
say
this
books
are
relevant
and
material.
is
that
fair
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
the
taxpayer
says
(inaudible)
--
suggest
that
the
--
there's
a
--
four
years
is
barred
so
therefore
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
do
you
think
that
--
do
think
that
(inaudible)
--
you're
going
to
get
to
the
time
bar
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
that's
your
first
--
that's
your
first
point
on
that
(inaudible)
that
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever
with
the
statute
of
limitations
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you're
investigating
--
your
--
if
you
want
to
see
my
book
not
because
you
think
i
am
fraudulent,
because
it'll
help
you
prove
that
justice
brennan
is
fraudulent,
you
can
get
my
book
without
saying
anything
other
than
give
me
your
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
about
it
from
my
book
and
satisfy
the
justices
about
the
material
helping
in
the
investigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
all
--
this
is
the
line
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
line
you've
drawn
on
a
lot
of
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
been
willing
to
say
that
but
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
like
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
this
one.
