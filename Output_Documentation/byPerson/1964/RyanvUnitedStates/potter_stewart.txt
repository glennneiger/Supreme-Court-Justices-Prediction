did
the
court
give
that
any

at

but
under

authority,
his
agent,
one
of

is

is
to

and
to

justice

he
does
them
all
the
time.
justice

that's
right.
that's
right,
its
done.
justice

if
assigned
to
him
it's
going
to
be

do

it's
very
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
some
talk
to
the
--
some
talk
in
the
hearing
about
the
--
mr.
kimble
and
his
brother
mr.
chester
kimble?
that's
the
matter
to
which
you
were
referring?
justice
potter
stewart
some
indication
of
a
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
he
prevented
from
exploring
that
before
the
district
court?
he
was
--
justice

(voice

justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
mr.
terris,
i
thought
that
the
government
conceded
that
under
7604
(a),
if
i
have
the
right
section,
providing
that
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
to
comply
with
the
summons
the
government
goes
into
the
district
court.
i
thought
you
conceded
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
is
not
ex
parte
like
a
search
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
hearing
normally
implies
the
right
to
cross-examine,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
permissible
issues
are
what?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
you
have
estimated
that
there
are
probably
more
or
less
a
hundred
cases
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
where
people
have
resisted
summons.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
supposed
there
was
thousands
if
not
hundred
of
thousands
of
cases
where
people
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
just
obeyed
the
summons,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
you
don't
know
how
many
of
the
39,000
which
are
not
resisted
are
time
barred,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that's
all
they're
intending
to
do
then
they
wouldn't
have
put
in
the
first
clause
before
the
“and”
they
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
begun
with
only
one
inspection.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
would've
done
it
the
minute
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
enacted
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
1921?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
here
is
after
the
enactment
of
the
internal
revenues
code.
justice
potter
stewart
was
--
were
the
relevant
statutes
of
limitation
the
same
back
there
as
they
are
now?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
that
what
you're
thinking
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
be
valid
only
if
that
were
true
i
should
think.
justice
potter
stewart
there
would
have
to
be
no
statute
at
all
as
you
call
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
--
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
my
question
or?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
the
answer,
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
this
suggestion
or
may
be
less
than
a
suggestion,
innuendo
of
bad
faith.
were
you
prevented
from
developing
any
such
claim
as
that
in
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
that
though.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“this
is
not
to
say
that
the
court
is
without
power
to
determine
whether
the
investigation
is
being
made
in
good
faith.”
and
are
you
--
i
want
to
know
if
you're
suggesting
here
that
you
are
making
a
claim
that
this
investigation
was
not
being
made
in
good
faith
and
that
you
were
prevented
from
pursuing
that
claim
in
the
district
court?
