the
agent
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
view
--
in
your
view
of
the
statute
in
terms,
what
the
--
what
would
the
situation
be
if
the
taxpayer
comes
in
and
says,
“well,
this
agent
tried
to
shake
me
down
in
a
claim
of
fraud
and
asked
me
to
give
him
a
bribe.
i
declined
to
do
it
and
that
was
followed
by
a
subpoena
for
all
my
books.”

prove
that
to
the
