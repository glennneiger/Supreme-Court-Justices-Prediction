justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
again,
can
these
revenue
agents
issue
the
subpoenas
as
--
just
at
their
own
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
terris,
as
to
a
time
barred
case,
i
would
suppose
this
gets
into
the
category
of
a
revived
case
only
if
for
some
reason
rather
it's
been
in
the
category
of
cases
where
perhaps
there's
fraud
which
permits
--
they
open
the
time
bar,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
finding
to
get
the
administrative
procedure.
if
it's
a
time
barred
case
how
would
the
agent
get
it,
unless
somehow
it
had
the
--
that
year
had
been
picked
up
for
some
reason
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
reason
would
be
suspected
fraud,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
would
be
something
as
to
which
the
agent
assigned
the
case
would
have
no
policy
decision
to
make,
would
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to,
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
the
agent
assigned
to
work
on
the
case
would
have
anything
to
do
with
his
getting
the
case
assigned
to
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
that
circumstance,
may
the
agent
then
without
consulting
anyone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i've
been
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
part
of
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
say
it
--
we
have
a
basis,
would
you
have
also
to
say,
"we've
conducted
an
investigation
or
have
been
conducting
an
investigation
around
three
or
four
months.
we
--
that
the
a
smell
of
something
here
that
we
think
requires
further
examination
because
if
the
smell
continues
it
looks
like
fraud.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
if
something
like
that,
you
come
in
to
brennan
and
certainly
would
summons,
and
you
drag
me
in
the
court
and
i
say
that,
“your
honor
this
was
barred
back
in
1950,
why
do
they
want
my
books?”
now
what
do
you
have
to
show?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
you
have
to
go
beyond
that
to
say,
“we've
been
conducting
the
investigation.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
brennan's
return
to
someone
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
government's
position
is
as
much
as
you
have
to
say
really
is,
"we
have
reason
to
suspect",
period,
is
that
it?
