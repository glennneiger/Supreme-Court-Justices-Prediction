justice
hugo
l.
black
had
it
been
checked
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i?
what
is
practically
the
result
of
your
--
what
would
be
the
practical
result
if
you
should
win
your
case
as
far
as
the
government
getting
to
examine
the
records?
the
practical
result
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
raise
it?
how
would
the
government
have
to
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
judicial
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
in
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
that
could
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
each
one
could
come
up
here
if
they
could
get
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
this
one
been
pending?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that,
you
mean
--
you
say
barred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
not
barred
if
there's
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
agree
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
--
if
there's
--
it
can
show
fraud
to
assess
the
taxes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
although
the
government
has
the
right
to
assess
the
taxes
that's
barred
by
fraud
that
the
general
autho
--
its
general
authority
to
investigate
the
books
could
not
be
had
until
you
have
a
judicial
hearing
and
determine
finally
once
and
for
all
that
there's
a
ground
for
the
government
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
after
that
it
has
to
go
back
through
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
be
--
then
they
could
go
to
court
again
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
each
case,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
would
take
--
i'm
just
looking
at
the
practical
effect
as
it
--
that
doesn't
govern
it,
but
it
might
have
some
bearing
as
to
what
congress
intended
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
defendant
--
the
defendant
who
is
worried
about
his
tax
wouldn't
like
to
leave
it
up
to
the
district
court,
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
delay
it
as
long
as
he
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
quite
actually
more
--
in
most
instances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
he
wouldn't
want
to
be
examined
if
he
had
been
honest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
that's
undoubtedly
right,
but
if
the
government
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
it,
you
agree
that
the
government
has
a
right
then
to
summon
them
and
make
them
produce
the
books.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
do
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
the
government
just
by
following
that
course
would
get
the
right
which
you
say
it
cannot
get
under
the
other
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
get
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
regard
to
--
without
requiring
that
it
be
proven
they
had
reasonable
ground
to
believe
there's
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what's
the
practical
benefit
then
if
you
get
out
of
this
--
if
you
win
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
a
delay
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
at
all,
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
they
can
go
into
the
tax
court
to
get
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
going
to
this
prior
trial
if
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
not
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
to
establish
that
the
government
had
reasonable
grounds
to
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
was
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
entitled
to
protect
(inaudible)
as
lawyer
before
the
commissioner
for
this
--
of
this
kind
of
a
--
ask
him
to
bring
into
court
--
(inaudible)
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
when
the
agent
gets
the
man,
gets
his
books.
does
he
have
a
right
to
defend
himself
here
against
an
examination
by
the
commissioner
the
same
as
though
if
it
was
on
a
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
--
does
he
also
have
the
right
to
require
a
open
hearing
before
the
commission
or
can
they
take
him
in
private?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
sure
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
an
open
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
if
you
do
get
an
open
hearing
then,
you
would
not
be
able
to
get
one
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
seem
to
recall
having
read
that
rather
detailed
regulations
on
the
subject
to
the
issuance
of
these
--
is
that
wrong,
in
your
book
of
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wrote
something
on
it
several
years
ago,
i
don't
recall
which
case,
but
i
read
them
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
rather
detailed
in
the
way
you
have
to
conduct
these
investiga
--
examinations,
how
they're
issued
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
thousand
of
the
40?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
only
basis
for
charging
it
in
an
unreasonable
investigation
or
examination,
the
one
you
have
stated
that
they
did
not
show
sufficiently
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
he
was
guilty
of
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
only
attack?
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
are
the
only
grounds
upon
which
you
attack,
the
reasonableness
of
the
procedure.
