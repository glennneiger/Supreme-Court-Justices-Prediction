ask
you
to
hire
--
issue
on
it,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
here
you
had
a
second
inspection
on
1945.
unknown
speaker
coming
back
to
some
of
justice
white's
questions,
the
agent
as
i
understand
from
what
you
say,
inform
the
court
that
he
had
conducted
a
net
worth
computation
on
the
1954
to
1958
taxes.
unknown
speaker
from
that
computation
that
he
suspected
fraud
in
the
previous
years,
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
made
it
of
those
years
after
all.
unknown
speaker
but
if
those
were
so
large
and
untoward
--
might
not
play
--
might
not
he
then
go
to
the
returns
which
he
evidently
did,
that
it
were
filed
for
the
previous
years
and
he
saw
that
they
were
small
perhaps
and
this
large
accumulation
of
net
worth
during
1954
to
1958
might
lead
to
suspicion
of
some
either
error,
defalcation
or
some
fraud
or
something
in
the
previous
returns.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
net
comp--
in
a
net
worth,
you'd
have
to
go
back
to
a
period
which
you
could
prove
exactly
how
much
money
you
had
or
you
had
nothing
on
the
other,
then
you
deal
forward.
do
you
remember
in
a
case
i
happen
to
write
in
colorado,
i
forgot
the
name
of
it
now
--
unknown
speaker
had
been
there
but
destroyed.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
here
though.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
can
i
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
the
issue
in
a
case
--
unknown
speaker
some
large
payments.
unknown
speaker
an
agent
couldn't
just
indiscriminately
run
around
issuing
subpoenas
on
cases
that
had
not
been
assigned
to
him.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
here
--
without
remedy
because
we're
not
getting
this
with
the
problem
of
the
constitutional
level,
are
we?
