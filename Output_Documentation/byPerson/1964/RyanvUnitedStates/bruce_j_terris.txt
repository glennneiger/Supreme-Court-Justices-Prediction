mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
that
i
could
just
point
to
you
a
couple
of
the
relevant
facts
which
may
have
been
a
little
clouded.
one
is
that
none
of
the
years
which
are
involved
here
was
there
a
prior
inspection
of
the
taxpayer's
records.
we
originally
asked
for
1945,
we
do
not
press
that
any
longer.
there
was
a
prior
inspection.
we
have
not
filed
a
necessary
notice
under
section
7605
(b)
and
we
are
not
now
entitled
those
records
unless
such
a
notice
is
filed,
and
has
not
yet
been
filed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
order
--
a
summons
may
be
issued
by
ordinary
agents
and
the
purpose
of
section
7605
(b)
was
that
the
congress
thought
that
ordinary
agent
shouldn't
have
the
authority
to
issue
summonses
when
there'd
already
been
a
prior
inspection
of
the
records.
and
so
what
the
congress
did
is
pick
out
this
one
group
where
there'd
been
a
prior
inspection
and
said
for
that
purpose
you've
got
to
have
--
there's
got
to
be
a
finding
by
either
the
commissioner
or
his
delegate
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
the
powell
case.
and
the
delegate
and
--
as
under
the
present
regulations
as
the
regional
commissioner,
there
are
eight
regional
commissioners
and
then
there's
an
additional
person
in
charge
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
overseas
operations,
so
there
are
nine
people
that
can
issue
that
kind
of
a
notice.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
he
has
a
supervisor
that
assigns
in
the
case,
but
it
can
be
started.
my
understanding
is
on
that
level,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
a
supervisor.
between
him
and
his
immediate
supervisor
who,
i
am
told,
covers
fraud
investigations
in
a
given
area.
it's
not
done
alone
by
the
very
low
assertion
and
it
is
one
step
above
that,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
where
the
issue
comes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
but
it
--
all
i'm
trying
to
say
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
agents
do
it
all
the
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
all
we're
trying
to
say
that
the
case
is
not
completely
his
case.
he's
got
--
it's
done
in
conjunction
with
some
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
only
way
that
after
six
years
has
ran,
the
only
way
that
the
government
can
assess
taxes
is
on
the
basis
of
fraud
that's
right
when
they
all
limit
assessment
counts.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
yes.
that's
right
it
is
picked
up
for
some
reason.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
between
the
two
of
them
they
would
decide
whether
the
information
they
got
was
worthless,
they
didn't
have
anything
or
to
make
it
worth
their
time
and
effort
or
if
it
was
worth
pursuant.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
what
happens
is,
there
are
all
kinds
of
ways.
there
maybe
an
informant.
there
maybe
reading
the
newspapers
that
suddenly
somebody
has
come
up
with
an
awful
lot
of
money
that's
been
filing
returns
that
don't
show
he
had
very
much
income.
there
maybe
another
--
some
other
taxpayer's
return
may
be
being
audited
and
something
occurs
in
that
return
which
shun
--
it
sheds
light
out
this
particular
taxpayer.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
the
supervisor
and
the
agent
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
between
the
two
of
them
--
well,
the
supervisor
assigns
it
to
the
agent.
the
agent
then
goes
out
and
pursues
an
investigation.
one
of
the
crucial
powers
that
he
has
and
duties
is
to
issue
summonses
both
to
taxpayers
and
to
third
parties,
to
see
records
to
see
whether
fraud
has
been
committed.
he
doesn't
know
at
that
point
whether
there
has
been
any
fraud.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
and
i'm
told
that
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
do
random
sampling
after
the
three
years
has
run.
now
this
makes
perfect
sense.
it's
a
bit
--
it
would
be
really
a
waste
of
time
and
effort.
you
have
a
limited
number
of
agents
and
if
you're
going
to
do
random
sampling,
you
would
do
it
prior
to
the
three-year
period
because
virtually
any
error
you
pick
up
during
that
period
you
can
do
something
about
it
and
after
the
three-year
period
most
of
the
things
that
you
find
you
can't
do
anything
about.
so
they
don't
do
random
sampling
and
i
don't
think
that
they
would
make
any
sense
for
them
to
do
so.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
--
i
think
that's
(inaudible)
--
is
that
so?
there
are
regulations
on
it
but
they
don't
have
very
detailed
--
in
my
understanding
is
they're
not
very
detailed
in
what
the
precise
standards
are.
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
i've
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
there
are,
your
honor.
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
they're
not
--
i
don't
think
it
goes
into
tremendous
detail
of
what
kind
of
information
that
you
have
to
have
in
order
to
justify
a
summons,
but
you
--
that
they
--
it
has
to
be
that
there
--
there
has
to
be
a
reason,
a
suspicion
that
there's
been
fraud.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
i
think
the
--
yes,
i
think
he
could.
and
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
recognize
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that
the
--
that
--
if
that's
really
the
allegation,
now,
there
seems
to
be
that
allega
--
petitioner's
counsel
seems
to
be
making
that
allegation
here.
it's
not
too
clear
what
the
allegation
is
but
he
seems
to
be
making
it.
however,
he
had
--
that
certainly
wasn't
his
argument
when
the
case
was
brought
to
this
court
and
it's
not
clear
on
his
brief
exactly
what
the
allegations.
he
seems
to
say
well,
there
might've
been
something
wrong
on
that
side
that
there
may
have
been
bad
faith.
therefore,
we
ought
to
have
the
right
to
have
a
probable
cause
standard.
i
don't
think
those
two
things
follow.
our
contention
is,
if
he
can
chose
--
show
us
a
shakedown
that's
quite
a
different
thing
than
requiring
the
government
to
show
probable
cause.
we
presume
in
the
ordinary
case
there
has
to
be
a
shakedown.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
there's
another
man
too
that
i
gather
from
reading
it,
what
he's
aiming
at
is
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
that's
right.
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
spelled
out
in
the
record.
he
never
states
what
his
theory
is.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
would
--
he
was
your
honor.
he
doesn't
seem
to
state
his
theory.
i
don't
know.
he
was
prevented.
i
must
say
that
it
is
irrelevant
on
the
phase
of
it
what
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
where
there
is
other
information
is
about.
he
never
actually
states,
you
know,
that
this
is
what
i'm
driving
at.
this
is
why
i'm
offering
this
evidence.
perhaps
if
he
had
clearly
stated
that
he
was
attempting
to
prove
bad
faith
that
the
district
court
would've
said,
“well,
then
we'll
hear
this
evidence.”
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
basic
argument,
isn't
--
it
isn't
this
bad
faith
being
other
than
maybe
as
it
colors
the
case
a
little
bit.
he's
arguing
that
the
government
has
to
show
probable
cause.
and
i
take
it
that
the
standard
is
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
first
circuit
which
is
the
circuit
other
than
the
third
which
most
clearly
agrees
with
him,
it
does
use
fourth
amendment
cases.
and
i
take
it,
what
he's
doing
and
his
combining
this
fourth
amendment
standard
then
with
much
more
loose
procedures,
he's
going
to
get,
you
know,
and
he's
going
to
end
up
--
this
has
been
suggested
here
by
your
honors
with
fairly
quite
a
strict
standard
of
proof
by
the
government
and
then
a
full
adversary
trial,
and
he
--
as
he
wants
it,
he
wants
to
cross-examine
the
government
witnesses.
i
take
it,
if
he
wants
to
put
on
witnesses
of
his
own,
get
an
appeal
and
ultimately
come
to
this
court
before
the
government
can
continue
with
its
investigation.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
we
do.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
we
do
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no.
we
fully
admit
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing.
the
question
is
what
is
he
entitled
to
a
hearing
on?is
he
entitled
to
a
miniature
trial
before
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
cross-examine
on
issues
which
may
be
brought
up
at
the
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
powell
case,
we
go
through
a
long
list
of
permissible
issues
based
on
lower
court
decisions
whether
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
person
have
been
violated,
example
the
fifth
amendment.
whether
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
involved,
whether
the
--
under
section
7602,
the
materials
are
relevant,
immaterial
to
the
inquiry.
where
the
req
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
depends
a
little
bit
on
what
--
on
the
--
on
what
you
consider
the
category.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
--
as
far
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
as
we
can
--
as
far
--
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
(inaudible)
and
in
a
closed
period
then.
the
best
we
can
estimate
and
it
is
just
an
estimate,
is
approximately
a
hundred
cases.
however,
the
significant
thing
is
and
this
is
very
important,
is
that
the
numbers
have
been
steadily
growing
and
it's
been
largely
growing
because
of
the
litigation
on
this
issue.
the
issue
of
whether
the
government
is
going
to
have
to
prove
part
of
its
case
before
it
can
continue
investigation.if
this
court
holds
that,
i
think
it's
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
we're
not
dealing
with
the
constitutional
problem
at
all
your
honor.
neither
this
case
nor
the
powell
case
raises
that
question.
i
only
alluded
to
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
appears
that
the
standard
that's
being
argued
for
under
section
7605
(b)
or
the
statute
of
limitations
or
whatever.
it
is
apparently
the
probable
cause
standard
in
the
fourth
amendment,
but
if
they
are
successful
in
that,
going
back
to
your
honor's
question,
i
think
it's
a
very
good
guess
that
that
amount
of
litigation
in
this
field
is
going
to
expand
very,
very
greatly.
people
are
not
going
to
be
very
willing
to
obey
summonses.
now,
these
other
category
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
these
are
fraud
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
it
appears
that
the
number
of
summons
is
issued
in
a
year,
it's
around
40,000.
approximately
--
and
these
are
really
all
estimates
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no.
in
toto,
i'm
saying
that
about
a
thousand
of
them,
of
those
are
resisted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
a
thousand
out
of
the
40,000,
that's
right,
somewhere
around
that.
about
a
hundred
of
these
thousand
are
in
time
barred.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
i
don't
--
perhaps
--
maybe
it's
the
--
roughly
the
same
percentage,
i'm
not
sure.
maybe
more
people
that
are
--
in
a
fraud
investigation
resist.
what
i'm
--
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
though
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
is
does
--
it
does.
the
point
i'm
tying
to
make
is
these
other
defenses
which
we
admit
can
be
made
at
the
hearing
are
defenses
which
are
largely
legal
in
which
the
--
in
most
instances
there
are
just
isn't
any
decent
claim
by
the
taxpayer.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
pretty
much
the
end
of
the
matter,
that's
right.
most
of
these
defenses
are
now
ones
that
would
arise
in
the
ordinary
case.
now
sometimes
they
do.
if
we
asked
for
--
i
suppose
if
we
have
one
particular
indication
of
fraud
about
general
motors
and
we
asked
to
have
all
of
general
motors'
books
brought
in
i
think
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
question
whether
we
would
be
able
to
get
them.
and
that
could
be
litigated
at
the
hearing
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
it
isn't
done.
it
isn't
done,
but
that
--
the
fact
that
it
isn't
done
only
shows
that
the
service
uses
prudence
in
deciding
the
breadth
of
its
summonses.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
our
initial
position
is
we
wouldn't,
however
if
--
and
when
i
go
through
the
section
by
section
of
the
code
i
think
we
can
establish
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
normally
yes.
yes
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor
it
would
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
he
was
done
--
it
was
done
in
this
case.
it
was
done
in
the
powell
case.
the
complaint
here
says
that
on
the
basis
of
net
worth
computations,
reasonable
grounds
exist
for
strong
suspicion.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
here
he
did
testify
a
little
bit.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
pretty
general.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
should
be
able
to
--
that's
right.
in
powell
he
didn't.
in
other
cases
which
we've
won
in
the
courts
of
appeals
he
has
not
testified,
the
foster
case
in
the
second
circuit.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
position
that
the
government
takes
in
this
case,
we
don't
believe
it's
a
noble
one
in
the
area
of
administrative
subpoenas.
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
several
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
dealt
with
administrative
subpoenas
issued
by
other
agencies.
one
is
united
states
versus
martin
salt
company
and
that's
in
338
united
states
and
involved
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
now,
let
me
say
what
the
purpose
of
citing
these
cases
is.
it's
not
--
these
cases
are
not
dispositive
of
the
entire
litigation.
what
they
do
show
is
that
this
basic
power
given
in
section
7602
to
issue
summonses
that
that
power
does
not
require
any
showing
of
probable
cause.
that
all
we
have
to
show
is
as
the
statute
says
that
the
records
sought
are
relevant
and
material,
but
that
--
that
that's
the
basic
scheme
for
administrative
agencies
in
this
country.
that's
why
i
would
cite
martin
salt
company
for,
oklahoma
press
publishing
company,
andy
card
johnson
&
perkins,
civil
aeronautics
board
and
herman,
and
all
these
cases
are
quite
clear
that
the
basic
understanding
for
administrative
agencies
is
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
show
relevancy
and
materiality.
and
i
may
say
what
--
there
is
significant
in
martin
salt
company,
the
administrative
power
is
analogized
to
the
power
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
passing
that
and
starting
from
the
point
of
view
that
section
7602
does
give
this
general
power
to
investigate
on
the
basis
merely
of
relevancy
and
materiality
no
showing
whatsoever
by
the
government
is
necessary.
then
we
get
to
the
two
sections
of
the
code
which
are
argued
by
the
taxpayer
to
limit
this
power.
and
it
seems
to
me
here
that
theses
decisions
of
this
court
established
that
the
taxpayer
then
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
in
this
field,
congress
has
done
something
different.
it
is
more
narrowly
limited
the
commissioner
than
it
has
limited
other
administrative
agencies.
the
taxpayer
has
this
burden.
i
think
that
he
has
to
show
therefore
that
these
statutes
on
which
he
relies
were
clearly
intended
to
limit
the
power.
so
let's
go
first
to
section
7605
(b)
and
that's
on
--
set
forth
on
page
27
of
the
government's
brief
in
powell
and
it's
also
in
the
last
page
of
petitioner's
brief
here
on
the
ryan
case.
and
i
think
it's
important
enough
and
short
enough
to
be
worth
reading.
it
says
no
(inaudible)
--
it
starts
out,
“restrictions
on
examination
of
taxpayer.
no
taxpayer
shall
be
subjected
to
unnecessary
examination
or
investigations
and
only
one
inspection
of
the
taxpayer's
books
of
account
shall
be
made
for
each
taxable
year,
unless
the
taxpayer
request
otherwise
or
unless
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
parenthetically
the
regional
commissioner
after
investigation
notifies
the
taxpayer
in
writing
that
an
additional
inspection
is
necessary.”
now
the
taxpayer
reads
this
section
as
having
two
separate
provisions.
one
is
that
an
examination
can't
be
unnecessary.
the
second
there
can't
be
a
second
investigation
except
for
under
certain
conditions.
now
the
second
part
of
the
statute
merely
doesn't
apply
to
him
at
all.
there
hasn't
been
a
second
inspection.
therefore
what
he
is
arguing
is
that
the
provision
about
investigations
not
being
unnecessary
incorporates
the
standard
of
probable
cause.
now
our
first
argument
is
that
there
are
--
there
is
not.
this
section
can
not
be
divided
into
two
pieces.
now
looking
just
in
its
language
i
think
you
could
reasonably
argue
either
way.
you
could
say
that
the
conjunction
then
separates
out
two
separate
sections
or
there
is
one.
however,
we
think
that
even
looking
to
the
language
alone
that
what
congress
was
apparently
intending
to
do
was
to
prevent
second
investigations.
we
think
this
is
partic
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
very
well
could've
done
that
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
congress
always
used
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
the
narrowest
language,
i
suppose
that's
right.
i
think
though
--
the
reason
i
say
that
i'd
--
that
even
from
the
wording
--
that
even
from
the
wording
that
that's
only
one
section
with
one
purpose
is
that
in
the
second
portion,
congress
again
used
the
term
necessary
which
suggests
that
what
it
was
doing
is
saying
there
shouldn't
be
unnecessary
examinations
and
that
it
considered
unnecessary
examinations
second
investigations
unless
a
high
official
in
the
service
said
they
were
necessary.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
now
let
me
take
the
--
except
the
taxpayers
premise
however
that
there're
two
sections
to
it,
and
that
the
first
part
this
applies
to
any
investigation
whether
it's
a
first
or
second
one.
webster
defines
unnecessary
as
needless
or
useless.
in
our
view
this
is
no
different
than
what
section
7602
requires,
because
it
requires
that
the
record
sought
to
be
relevant
and
material.
if
records
--
if
the
records
are
relevant
and
material
they
certainly
are
not
needless
or
useless.
and
therefore,
we
believe
that
even
accepting
the
taxpayer's
premise
that
still
all
that
we
have
to
show,
all
that
the
service
has
to
show
is
relevancy
and
materiality
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
not
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
relevancy
and
materiality?
well
i
hope
to
show
your
honor
that
it
would
suffice.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
something.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
there
is
no
--
this
phrase
that
the
year
is
barred
is
a
shorthand
and
slightly
misleading
phrase.
there
is
no
completely
barred
year.
the
government
can
always
investigate
and
asses
for
fraud.
so
there
--
if
it
was
totally
barred
then
of
course
we'd
be
in
quite
a
different
situation.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
am
going
to
your
honor.
let
me
deal
just
for
a
moment
with
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
because
even
if
the
wording
of
section
7605
were
less
clear
than
we
think
it
is
that
the
legislative
history
which
is
set
out
in
full
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
powell
case
and
it's
quite
briefed
but
it's
--
we
think
it's
sufficient
because
both
the
committee
reports,
the
sponsors
and
the
house
and
the
senate,
and
individual
congressmen
in
both
houses
stated
in
its
purpose
was
to
prevent
the
embarrassment
of
taxpayers
by
repeated
investigations
unless
there
was
a
good
reason
for
further
examination
of
their
records.
and
congress
was
willing
to
allow
this
determination
of
whether
there
was
good
reason
to
be
left
to
the
commissioner
or
to
his
deputy,
but
not
to
ordinary
agents.
there's
not
a
single
word
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
was
even
considering
the
problem
of
initial
examinations,
and
there's
certainly
not
a
word
to
indicate
the
probable
cause
or
any
other
judicially
enforced
standard
was
being
imposed
for
the
first
time
on
the
service.
and
we
think
it's
very
strange
to
assume
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
the
absence
of
any
discussion
whatsoever
when
there
was
considerable
discussion
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
in
another
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
is
in
1921,
just
know
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
notice
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
there
was
a
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
certainly
would
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
we
--
if
there
would
have
to
be
a
statute
of
limitations
a
number
of
years
would
not
have
to
be
identical.
that
the
number
of
years
is
purely
fortuitous
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
to
make
it
--
to
make
the
situation
different.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
not
certain
of
it
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
am
almost
certain
that
there
was
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
because
my
recollection
is
that
the
first
cases
in
this
field
which
were
prior
to
the
1939
code
talked
about
the
statute
of
limitations
and
i
think
it
was
three
years.
i
may
say
that
the
cases
that
--
i
may
say
the
cases
that
do
deal
with
the
earlier
statutes
are
cited
in
the
powell
--
in
our
reply
brief
in
powell
and
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
powell,
in
re
keagan,
brooklyn
pawn
brokers,
the
andrews
case,
and
i
--
and
they
discussed
the
statue
of
limitations.
and
i'm
almost
certain
that
there
was
a
statute
and
that
it
was
three
years.
let
me
now
turn
to
the
effect
of
the
statute
of
limitation,
section
6501.
i
may
say
that
there
is
no
three
years.
there's
a
--
there
are
three
periods.
there's
a
three
years
and
then
there's
three
to
six
which
has
a
different
effect
and
then
there's
the
period
after
six
years.
before
three
all
tax
liability
is
open,
three
to
six
years,
fraud
and
under
statement
of
income
by
more
than
25%
is
open,
after
six
years
just
fraud
is
open,
or
failure
to
file
a
return
at
all.
now
on
its
phase,
section
6501
doesn't
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
with
investigations.
it
doesn't
limit
the
commissioner's
power.
it
doesn't
limit
the
commissioner's
power
to
make
his
assessments.
when
we
submit
the
absence
of
any
congressional
intent
shown,
either
in
legislative
history
on
the
phase
of
the
statute
that
the
basic
rule
of
section
7602,
which
as
i've
indicated,
is
unmodified
by
section
7605
should
mean.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
that
we
make
a
showing
of
relevancy
and
materiality
because
we've
got
to
do
that
under
section
7602.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
that's
just
the
ordinary
rules
i've
indicated
for
administrative
subpoenas.now
there
are
creations
of
--
how
far
you
can
lead
from
that.
you
can
say,
well,
we
have
to
state
that
they're
relevant
and
material
to
investigation
for
fraud.
we'll
actually
--
the
particular
summons
my
not
actually
go
to
fraud.
for
example,
we
--
they
have
other
evidence
of
fraud.if
the
summons
goes
to
a
tax
deficiency
that
tax
deficiency
is
opened
up
by
the
fraud
and
we
can
collect
50%
of
the
total
tax
deficiency
not
just
to
the
fraud
part.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
so
that
the
particular
summons
does
not
even
have
to
go
to
fraud.
it
can
go
to
ordinary
tax
liability
but
the
investigation
as
a
whole
we
can
only
make
an
assessment
on
the
basis
of
fraud.
on
the
other
hand,
we
may
be
just
starting
the
investigation
and
starting
with
tax
liability.
the
oklahoma
press
publishing
company
case
says
that
the
government
need
not
show
coverage
of
a
statute
before
it
looks
to
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
it
can
do
that
both
at
the
same
time.
so
we
could
--
or
even
separately,
so
we
could
be
issuing
a
summons
in
order
to
show
tax
liability.
later
on
then
look
to
see
whether
there
had
been
fraud.
but
alternatively,
even
if
we're
wrong
about
the
statute
of
limitations
our
alternative
argument
is
as
been
suggested
by
your
honors
that
the
complaint
in
testimony
in
this
case
were
sufficient
that
it's
enough
to
say
that
we
have
a
basis
for
suspecting
the
fraud
that's
been
committed,
and
here
of
course
we
went
beyond
that.
we
gave
it
at
least
to
some
extent
in
conclusory
terms
the
basis
for
the
statement.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
without
colorful
language
your
honor
that's
about
what
the
complaint
says.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
our
initial
position
is
all
we
have
to
show
it's
relevant
and
material
to
a
valid
investigation
that's
it.
alternatively,
we
argue
that
it's
enough
to
state
by
affidavit
or
testimony
that
we
have
reason
to
believe,
that
we
have
reason
to
suspect,
that
we
have
this
suspicion
that
fraud
has
been
committed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
here
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
then
you
can
move
up
one
more
step
and
say
that
we
have
to
give
a
little
more
information.
the
trouble
is
that
if
these
are
imperceptible
gradations,
the
next
step
that
the
taxpayer
argues
that
we
have
to
then
present
the
evidence
to
show
in
detail.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
justice
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
now
so,
--
what
happens
is
in
some
cases
we
give
the
evidence.
if
we
think
we're
going
to
lose
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
give
--
that's
right,
we
didn't
give
the
evidence
at
all
in
powell.
we
rely
entirely
on
an
affidavit,
but
here
we
gave
the
evidence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honor,
i
think
everything
i've
argued
in
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
it
would
carry
me
on
the
second
one.
thank
your
honor.
