justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
a
majority
of
dissenting
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unanimous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what's
wrong
with
quoting
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
words
rich
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
word
rich
litigant
appear
in
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
quite
different,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
altogether
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
in
the
sense
used?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
if
he
had
said,
"we
will
do
this
because
he
is
a
rich
litigant",
that
would've
been
one
thing
which
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
sense
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
it,
it
seems
to
me
is
that
they
were
bothered
what
the
court
have
said
that
the
rules
should
be
interpreted
toward
not
to
give
advantage
to
rich
litigants.
not
that
he
was
saying,
they
should
decide
against
this
litigant
because
he's
rich.
maybe
that
he
could
have
explained
more
better
than
he
did
why
he
--
judge
hadn't
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
did
not
say
that
this
case
could
be
decided
against
the
--
your
client
because
he
was
a
rich
litigant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
does
have
relevancy
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
have
relevancy
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)in
determining
the
basis
of
the
rule,
it
would
not
be
administered
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
a
certain
way
that
rich
litigants
would
get
an
unfair
advantage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
--
so
far
as
i
can
see
from
what
you've
said
and
what
i've
read
of
what
judge
weinfeld
said,
he
didn't
say
that
he
was
deciding
this
against
your
client
because
he
was
a
rich
litigant.
there's
quite
a
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
you're
like
--
maybe
you're
stretching
it
and
maybe
the
other
side
minimized
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
issue
here
so
whether
he
abuses
discretion
in
doing
it,
isn't
it,
or
whether
he
had
a
right
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
two
questions
isn't
it,
are
there
any
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
otherwise
directly
means,
according
to
your
contention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basis
of
your
contention
that
he
based
it
on
caprice
and
arbitrariness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i
was
just
trying
to
get
down
to
the
issue
on
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
cause
i
haven't
fully
understood
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
either
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
i
don't
want
to
--
i
do
want
to
get
the
issues
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
all
i
wanted
to
ask
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
find
out
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
while
you're
on
that
point
was
this.
when
we're
thinking
about
the
facts
that
these
are
witnesses,
they've
been
brought,
is
it
your
idea
that
the
court
if
it
decided
that
they
were
summoning
witnesses
that
could
just
as
well
have
given
that
evidence
by
deposition
that
the
court
cannot
reduce
costs
on
that
grounds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
that's
--
this
--
i
was
asking
(inaudible)
that
goes
to
the
point
of
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
is
it
your
position
that
--
i
recall
it
is,
about
20
witnesses
were
summoned
at
one
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
didn't.
i'm
not
talking
about
--
you
did
here.
i'm
testing
what
the
issue
is.
20
witnesses
were
summoned
for
one
point,
the
court
wouldn't
let
them
use
just
two
or
three.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
been
made
to
pay
under
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
summoned
the
witnesses
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
court
have
been
required
to
let
you
pay
those
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
one
step
further,
would
it
be
within
his
discretion
where
the
expenses
were
great
in
bringing
somebody
from
a
foreign
country
to
say,
“well,
you
could've
done
this
just
as
well
by
deposition.
we
heard
the
evidence.
we've
seen
the
case
tried
and
we've
reached
a
conclusion
that
they
could've
done
all
right
with
deposition,
if
not,
then
they
bringing
them
here
was
not
justified”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
position
is
then
that
for
a
rigid
rule,
it
says
the
court
cannot
ever
by
the
sharp
issues
of
fact,
maybe
that's
right,
cannot
ever
say,
“well,
you
could've
done
this
as
well
by
deposition.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
tax
these
costs
against
your
opponent.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
thank
you.
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
but
i
wanted
before
you
left
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
the
issue
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
you
say
had
said
that
about
the
pretty
girl?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
testify
on
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
dr.
farmer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
doctor
testify
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
testify
at
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
testify
that
he
had
or
had
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
that
the
crux
point
of
dispute
between
him
and
the
lady?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
point
of
dispute
was,
he
said
he
did,
both
of
them
agreed
that
the
test
had
been
taken.
but
she
testified,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
had
not
waited
for
them,
he
testified
he
had.
was
that
the
point
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
testify
at
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
both
of
--
i'm
trying
to
get
what
the
point
of
issue
was
if
it
--
if
the
--
that
your
--
that
the
question
of
reasonable
is
necessary.
and
the
nurse
testified
with
a
uniform,
as
i
understand
it,
that
quite
different
to
him
as
to
whether
they
--
he
had
waited
for
it
at
the
trial.
but
both
agreed
that
it
was
not
--
that
the
test
were
taken.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
(inaudible)
--
both
agreed
they
didn't
take
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
that
the
judge
has
made
this
decision
to
hear
that
evidence
from
both
sides?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
--
what
did
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you've
emphasized
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
all
you
want.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
quotation
from
which
you've
read
lead
me
to
ask
the
question,
do
you
think
that
in
order
to
hold
that
judge
weinfeld
was
wrong
that
that
would
mean
that
he
was
deciding
against
the
rich
because
the
rich
were
rich?
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
said
reasonable
and
proper,
he
puts
those
in
issue
as
i
recall
it
in
the
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
should
be
reasonable
and
proper
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
he?
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
not
be
relevant
in
construing
the
rule
according
to
the
judge
(inaudible)
as
meaning
that
it
was
not
to
have
a
set
up
in
some
way,
it
would
allow
the
person
who
is
rich
enough
to
do
so
to
oppress
the
person
who
was
poor
in
a
litigation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
was
a
philosophical
observation
there,
but
why
--
are
we
to
decide
--
if
we
decide
with
you
that
judge
weinfeld
did
this
in
order
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
rich,
because
he
were
rich?
