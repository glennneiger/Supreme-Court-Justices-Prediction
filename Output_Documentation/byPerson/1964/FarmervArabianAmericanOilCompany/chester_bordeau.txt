mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
mr.
nulman's
statement
yesterday,
he
stated
that
there
is
--
that
the
(inaudible)
respondent
in
one
case,
the
petitioner
and
another,
had
pay
--
played
fast
and
loose
with
the
court.
i'm
very
much
disturbed
about
such
a
statement
being
made
to
this
court.
in
the
first
place
i
must
say
again
as
i
said
to
mr.
nulman,
i
will
rely
on
the
record
and
i
will
rely
on
the
statements
made
in
my
reply
brief,
but
i
should
like
to
have
just
one
opportunity
to
point
out
the
type
of
fast
and
looseness
that
mr.
nulman
speaks
of.
at
page
3,
mr.
nulman's
answering
brief
in
number
33,
he
states
although
the
words
leech
--
rich
litigant
i
enclosed
by
the
defendant
in
quotation
marks
followed
by
a
reference
to
pages
754,
755,
the
reference
in
our
brief
was
t74
and
t55
of
the
transcript
of
this
record
which
is
before
this
court,
wherein
this
quotation
is
presumably
to
be
found.
the
fact
is
that
neither
at
that
place
nor
elsewhere
is
such
a
quotation
to
be
found.
judge
weinfeld
never
used
any
such
term
nor
did
he
refuse
to
award
the
defendant
an
allowance
on
any
such
ground.
and
now
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
record
before
this
court
and
i
refer
to
pages
54
and
55
of
the
record
which
is
an
opinion
by
judge
weinfeld
delivered
by
him
on
september
the
11th,
1962
relating
to
costs
that
had
been
taxed
and
on
his
review
of
the
taxation
of
those
costs
on
the
second
trial.
at
page
54,
judge
weinfeld
stated
that
rule
54
(d),
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
provides
that
cost
shall
be
allowed
as
of
cost
to
the
prevailing
party
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs,
vest
discretion
in
the
court
in
passing
upon
the
necessity
and
reasonableness
of
the
costs.
the
policy
of
the
federal
courts
has
been
to
keep
litigation
cost
down
as
particularly
enunciated
in
rule
1
of
the
rule
--
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
then
judge
weinfeld
proceeds
to
quote
from
that
rule,
“to
secure
the
just,
speedy
and
inexpensive
determination
of
every
action”.
that
is
the
end
of
the
quotation
from
the
rule.
judge
weinfeld
then
proceeds
to
stay
the
court's
discretion
should
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
that
policy
to
quote
--
to
avoid
“making
the
federal
court
only
for
rich
litigants”.
the
quotation
is
from
a
statement
contained
in
the
opinion
of
circuit
judge
clark
on
the
appeal
from
the
order
dismissing
the
complaint
for
the
failure
--
from
the
plaintiff's
failure
to
furnish
a
bond
for
security
--
for
costs.
mr.
chester
bordeau
judge
clark's?
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
was
unanimous
sir.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
was
unanimous.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i'm
not
claiming
it's
wrong
to
quote
it.
i'm
addressing
myself
mr.
justice
black
to
the
statement
made
by
my
opponent
that
we
made
a
misstatement
in
saying
and
using
the
words
rich
litigant
and
attributing
it
to
judge
weinfeld.
now
here,
judge
weinfeld
quoting
those
very
words
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
he's
adopting
those
words
and
stating
those
words,
that's
all
we're
saying,
that's
the
only
purpose
of
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
definitely,
yes.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it's
on
page
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
the
answering
brief
of
the
respondent,
he
says
although
the
words
rich
litigant
are
enclosed
by
the
defendant
in
quotation
marks
followed
by
a
reference
to
pages
7,
it
should
be
54
and
55
of
the
record,
where
this
quotation
is
presumably
to
be
found,
the
fact
is
that
neither
at
that
place
nor
elsewhere
in
such
quote
--
is
such
a
quotation
to
be
found.
judge
weinfeld
never
used
any
such
term
nor
did
he
refuse
to
award
the
defendant
an
allowance
on
any
such
ground.
i
say
he's
adoption
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
of
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
used
by
judge
weinfeld.
mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
chief
justice,
all
i
am
trying
to
do
at
this
time,
i'm
going
to
come
into
more
detail
in
answer
to
you
question
later
on,
but
if
you
want
me
to
answer
now,
i
will.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
all
i'm
doing
now
is
to
try
to
indicate
and
to
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
when
the
plaintiff
said
that
we
are
playing
fast
and
loose
with
the
court
in
making
statements
such
as
contained
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
words
rich
litigant
by
judge
weinfeld.
and
he
said
judge
weinfeld
never
used
those
terms.
all
i
wanted
to
do
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
at
this
point
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
judge
weinfeld
does
say
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court's
discretion
--
now,
he's
talking
about
a
discretion
in
the
awarding
or
denial
of
cause,
should
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
that
policy.
that
is
the
policy
referred
to
in
rule
1
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
to
avoid
“making
the
federal
court
a
court
only
for
rich
litigants”.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
it's
clear
that
judge
weinfeld
is
stating
that
a
discretion
should
not
be
used
that
a
discretion
should
be
exercised
in
conformity
to
avoid
a
court
being
used
for
only
rich
litigants
and
that's
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
the
only
point
we
made.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
(inaudible)
mr.
chester
bordeau
well.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
words
appear
in
the
opinion
of
judge
weinfeld
and
we
have
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
the
opinion
here.
mr.
chester
bordeau
not
litigant,
it's
the
word
rich
litigants.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
don't
see
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
think
that's
--
i
think
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
that's
the
sense
of
this
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
he
is
making
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
this
statement
is
made
by
judge
weinfeld
in
a
consideration
of
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
a
district
judge
in
passing
upon
cost.
i
imagine
it
must
have
some
relevancy
and
i
think
the
relevancy
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
which
we
(inaudible)
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
pardon?
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh
yes!
i
maintain
it
does.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
the
fact
is
he
did
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
the
fact
is
that
he
did
rule
against
us.
he
brought
the
cost
down
from
some
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
$6000
to
$800.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct,
that's
one
of
the
questions.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
there
are
a
number
of
questions
here
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
try
to
go
in
to
those
if
i
may.
i
think
it
would
be
of
interest
at
the
beginning
or
in
the
consideration
of
this
appeal
that
the
court's
attention
should
be
called
to
the
specific
rules
and
the
specific
statutes
that
we
are
called
upon
to
consider
in
the
disposition
of
this
appeal.
i
have
those
statutes
and
rules
in
my
appendix.
they
appear
at
pages
2
(a)
and
3
(a)
of
the
appendix.
i
think
those
are
the
things
that
we
have
to
start
off
with.
these
are
the
statutes,
these
are
the
rules,
but
the
courts
below
have
been
construing
in
what
--
which
this
court
would
--
i
believe
will
be
called
upon
to
construe.
rule
54
which
appears
at
page
2
(a)
of
the
--
of
my
appendix
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
the
federal
cost,
rule
54,
judgments,
costs,
subdivision
(b)
cost,
“except
when
expressed
provision
therefore
is
made
either
in
a
statute
of
the
united
states
or
in
these
rules,
cost
shall
be
allowed
as
of
course
to
the
prevailing
party
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs”.
and
then
it
goes
on
as
about
to
the
united
states
with
which
we're
not
concerned.
with
cost
against
the
united
states,
they
shall
be
imposed
only
to
the
extent
permitted
by
the
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i
think
what
that
means
mr.
justice
black
is
this.
that
if
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
should
determine
that
costs
should
not
be
allowed
as
a
matter
cost
but
there
must
be
some
reason,
there
must
be
some
legal
reason,
some
legal
consideration
in
the
court's
exercising
a
discretion
for
i
am
sure
that
the
congress
and
that
this
court
would
not
consider
discretion
to
be
an
exercise
of
the
will
of
the
judge
based
on
caprice,
on
arbitrariness
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
on
whimsical
--
pardon?
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
that's
--
no,
i'm
just
saying
--
i'm
talking
now
about
what
is
discretion
and
i'm
going
further.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
that's
what
i'm
coming
to.
mr.
chester
bordeau
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
then
i
say
that
the
discretion
that
the
court
is
talking
about
is
a
legal
discretion.
in
other
words,
when
should
a
court
exercise
its
discretion
this
way
and
when
should
a
court
exercise
its
discretion
that
way.
there
should
be
some
guidepost
to
direct
or
to
help
or
to
suggest
to
a
court
when
it
should
exercise
in
granting
costs
and
denying
costs,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
general
purpose
under
this
rule
seems
to
be
if
the
cost
shall
be
allowed
as
of
course
to
the
prevailing
party
unless
the
court
directs
otherwise.
now,
i
say
that
the
discretion
i
suggest
that
the
discretion
to
be
exercised
by
the
court
should
be
exercised
in
this
way.
if
there
should
be
a
determination
by
the
trial
judge
in
this,
i
say,
is
the
only
place
where
discretion
should
apply.
in
his
discretion,
if
he
should
determine
that
an
expense,
whether
it
be
travel
expense,
"study
case
expenses",
or
other
expenses
that
may
be
incurred
as
permitted
by
the
statute,
and
that
is
the
statute
we're
referring
to
here,
1920
i
think
it
is,
which
appears
on
page
4
(a)
which
list
the
items
of
cost
that
may
be
allowed.
that
he
should
determine
whether
or
not
the
incurring
of
those
expenses
which
are
referred
to
in
section
1920
of
the
judicial
code
which
as
your
honors
will
note
provides
for
the
taxation
of
cost
that
is
may
tax
again,
may
tax
discretionary,
fees
of
the
clerk,
of
the
marshal,
fees
of
the
court
reporter,
or
all
or
any
part
of
this
(inaudible)
phonographic
transcript
necessarily
obtained
for
use
in
a
case.
three,
and
this
is
the
one
that
applies
to
the
witnesses
coming
upon
places
outside
of
the
united
states
and
from
far
places
in
the
united
states.
fees
and
disbursements
for
printing
and
witnesses,
and
then
they
have
another
one,
fees
for
the
exemplification
and
copies
of
papers
necessarily
obtained
for
use
in
the
case.
now
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
it
has
no
limitation.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
might
suggest
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
for
the
witness
from
places
that
they
suggest
here
required
to
travel
between
the
territories
and
possessions
or
to
and
from
the
continental
united
states
shall
be
entitled
to
the
actual
expenses
of
travel
at
the
lowest
first
class
rate.
i
might
suggest
that
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
in
order
for
such
a
witness
to
come,
and
say
from
dhahran,
saudi
arabia
he
is
required
to
travel
from
dhahran
to
the
united
states,
i
think
it's
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
might
i
suggest
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
might
i
suggest
to
that
--
to
your
honor
that
of
course
the
subpoena
power
wouldn't
run
to
saudi
arabia
or
europe.
mr.
chester
bordeau
so,you'd
--
they
require
(inaudible)
about
subpoena's
power.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
the
only
--
i
might
call
your
honor's
attention,
i
don't
want
to
avoid
answering
you
question,
that
this
section
1900
and
i
was
speaking
of
1821,
there
is
a
reference
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
in
which
it
had
said
the
purpose
of
this
bill,
i'm
reading
now
from
the
legislative
history.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it's
referred
to
in
my
brief,
but
this
is
a
legal
document.
mr.
chester
bordeau
united
states
courts
and
commissioners'
witness
fees
and
it's
printed
from
senate
report,
number
187,
march
28,
1949
to
comp
--
to
the
company
senate
bill
635.
the
exact
references
are
given
in
my
brief
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
chester
bordeau
surely
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
know
what
that
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
if
i
answer
you
fully
--
i
was
just
about
to
give
you
this
legislative
history,
if
you
want
it?
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes,
i
do
so
contend.
mr.
chester
bordeau
because
i
say
the
deposition
--
the
use
of
deposition
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
we've
had
two
trials,
and
which
has
been
described
by
at
least
two
or
three
judges
in
the
appeal
courts
as
involving
a
very
sharp
issue
of
fact
and
i'll
go
into
those
issues
later.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
we
didn't
do
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
the
answer
to
your
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
this.
that
it
would
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
determine
whether
one,
two,
three
or
20
witnesses
were
necessary
for
the
determination
of
the
truth
with
respect
to
the
matter
testified
to
it.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
there
would
be
a
distinct
dis
--
abuse
of
discretion
in
a
case
involving
sharp
issues
of
fact.
i
think
there
is
only
one
way
to
come
to
the
truth
where
a
sharp
issue
of
fact
is
involved,
is
to
look
the
witness
in
the
eye
and
to
observe
him
in
the
giving
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
of
his
testimony.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
that's
probably
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
yes.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
appreciate
you're
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
asking
a
question.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
would
--
i
was
coming
to
that
and
i
would
like
to
have
that
opportunity,
but
i
don't
think
and
unless
--
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
is
not
been
fully
answered
on
this
--
could
you
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes.
the
purpose
of
the
this
bill
is
to
increase
the
fees
of
witnesses
appearing
at
the
united
states
courts
and
before
united
states
commissioners
from
the
presently
existing
amount
of
$2
per
day
to
the
sum
of
$4
per
day,
the
(inaudible)
--
subsistence
fee
from
$4
per
day
to
$5
per
day.
and
the
travel
allowance
from
the
presently
existing
5
cents
per
mile
to
7
cents
per
mile.
the
mere
statement
of
the
fact
that
the
present
fee
for
witnesses
is
$2
per
day,
subsistence
is
$4
per
day
and
the
mileage
is
5
cents
per
day,
points
up
the
present
inadequacy
of
such
amounts
to
fairly
compensate
the
individual
either
for
his
time
or
expenses
incident
to
his
service
as
a
witness.
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
and
require
witnesses
to
attend
court
at
a
personal
financial
loss.
and
going
on,
the
amounts
arrived
at
in
this
bill
are
considered
to
be
more
fair
than
presently
existing
to
then
existing
amounts,
although
it
is
recognized
that
certain
witnesses
will
not
under
the
proposed
rates
be
adequately
compensated
in
order
to
fairly
compensate
everyone
appearing
as
a
witness
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
either
a
graduated
scale
of
fees
or
leave
the
amount
of
such
fees
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
neither
was
con
--
neither
was
it
considered
feasible
and
therefore
the
amounts
arrived
at
herein
are
more
or
less
arbitrary
or
considered
to
be
necessary
fair
to
the
average
witness.
and
then
there
is
attached,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
to
this
statement
of
purpose.
there
is
a
statement
from
the
assistant
to
the
attorney
general,
mr.
peyton
ford,
to
the
honorable
pat
mccarran,
chairman
of
the
committee
on
judiciary
in
which
he
refers
to
these
various
items
to
which
i
have
--
from
which
i've
just
quoted.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
this,
this
is
the
assistant
to
the
attorney
general.
therefore,
doing
a
review
of
the
law
--
of
the
laws
relating
--
fixing
the
rates
of
compensation
for
witnesses
and
the
reimbursement
for
their
expenses
reveal
that
the
witnesses'
attendance
fee
and
subsistence
allowance
are
the
same
as
they
were
40
years
ago.
such
rates
--
then
he
talks
more
about
these
rates,
i
won't
burden
you
with
that.
then
he
winds
up
this
way,
for
overseas
travel,
and
i
think
is
what
you're
interested
in
mr.
justice
goldberg.
for
overseas
travel,
it
is
recommended
that
witnesses
be
allowed
their
actual
expenses
at
the
lowest
first
class
rate
available.
there
have
been
times
when
a
witness
had
been
required
to
engage
in
such
travel
at
a
personal
financial
sacrifice.
a
draft
of
the
proposed
bill
to
accomplish
the
foregoing
purposes
enclosed.
and
at
that
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
than
that
would
--
wouldn't
that
be
placed
in
a
criminal
statute,
your
honor?
mr.
chester
bordeau
this
is
--
this
1821
applies
to
civil
cases.
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes,
to
both,
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
there
in
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
goldberg
of
there
being
any
provision
in
the
law
whereby
a
citizen
of
france
or
of
england
could
be
required
to
attend
in
the
united
states,
and
that's
what
this
statute
is
talking
about,
overseas.
mr.
chester
bordeau
of
course
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
don't
rely
--
we
don't
rely
solely
on
that
amendment
to
1821
which
is
made
in
1948.
that
is
only
one
of
the
arguments
that
we
make.
now
in
order
to
follow
the
suggestion
made
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
action
was
commenced
in
the
year
1956,
i
think
these
dates
and
this
little
bit
of
history
is
quite
important.
in
1956,
in
the
original
complaint,
the
plaintiff
claimed
$4000.
an
answer
was
interposed
amounting
to
a
general
denial.
in
1958,
this
is
a
year
and
a
month
before
the
first
trial,
before
judge
palmieri
on
may
the
11th,
1958
and
in
april
of
1958
i
say,
there
was
an
order
--
an
answer
served
by
this
defendant.
and
that
answer
appears
at
page
--
maybe
at
my
record
--
appears
at
page
3
and
4
of
the
transcript
in
this
case.
you've
heard
many
statements
about
there
being
injected
various
defenses
on
the
eve
of
trial.
now
here
is
an
answer,
was
interposed
and
filed
in
the
court
in
april
of
1958,
and
it
says,
“as
and
for
its
affirmative
defense”
page
3,
“that
the
agreement
alleged
in
paragraph
third,
fourth
and
fifth
of
the
complaint
is
void
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it
was
not
in
writing.”
and
as
a
--
as
in
42nd
affirmative
defense,
page
4,
the
defense
alleges
if
and
in
the
event
that
it
is
found
that
plaintiff
was
employed
by
the
defendant
for
a
term
as
he
claimed
in
his
complaint.
defendant
alleges
that
he'd
terminated
plaintiff's
employment
for
a
good
cause
and
yet
we
have
heard
a
lot
of
the
many
statements
made
here
that
this
defense
was
not
raised
until
the
trial
commenced
in
1959.
well,
that's
just
not
true.
here,
that
answer
was
filed
and
the
docket
of
the
clerk
will
show
that
it
was
filed,
and
i
have
a
photocopy
of
that
docket
here,
and
that's
in
april
of
1958
in
the
trial
may
of
1959.
we
were
not
injecting
any
new
issues
on
the
eve
of
trial,
but
then
we
were
(inaudible)
--
that's
what
the
pleadings
were.
now,
i
conducted
an
examination
before
trial
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
1956,
of
the
--
(inaudible)
--
i
think
the
suit
was
started
in
june,
it
was
removed
and
within
the
required
time
i
think
we
interposed
an
answer
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct,
by
permission
of
the
court.
that
was
an
order
entered
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
by
permission
of
the
court
and
that
order
also
appears
in
the
record,
it's
an
order
of
mr.
justice
or
rather
chief
justice
--
chief
judge
ryan.
now,
to
proceed
pursuant
to
the
suggestion
made,
i
conducted
an
examination
before
trial,
dr.
farmer
in
new
york.
and
that
was
in
the
year
--
in
october
of
1956.
and
i
questioned
dr.
farmer
with
respect
to
the
occasion
of
his
discharge
by
the
defendant.
he
claimed
that
he
was
discharged,
i
think
this
is
very
important
in
the
background
of
this
case,
that
he
was
discharged
because
he
had
refused
to
be
intimidated
by
the
defendant's
doctors
into
making
false
reports
with
respect
to
his
findings
relating
to
trachoma.
trachoma
is
a
very
serious
eye
disease
which
in
many
cases
leads
to
blindness.
he
said
he
was
being
intimidated
and
bullied
to
make
false
entries,
to
make
false
diagnoses
of
his
findings
with
respect
to
trachoma.
and
it
was
for
that
reason,
said
he,
that
he
was
discharged.
and
i
asked
him
whether
or
not
he
wasn't
discharged
for
the
reason
that
he
had
conducted
a
non-emergency
operation
on
a
four
and
a
half
year
old
arab
boy
who
had
a
sickness
or
disease
of
the
eye,
i
think
it's
called
chalazions
which
are
growths
on
the
inner
lids
of
the
eyes.
and
that
this
operation
was
performed
under
general
anesthesia
and
i
asked
him
whether
or
not
it
was
not
an
accepted
rule
in
the
medical
profession
that
before
any
operation
is
performed
under
general
anesthesia
that
there
should
first
be
obtained
by
the
operating
surgeon
the
results
of
pre-laboratory
tests.
those
pre-laboratory
tests
are
urinalysis
and
a
blood
count.
he
said
he
never
heard
of
such
a
rule.
it
wasn't
until
he
returned
in
1956
sometime
immediately
prior
at
the
time
when
i
examined
him
that
he
has
learned
of
any
such
rule.
he
also
testified
that
he
conducted
this
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
we
are
referring
to
a
written
rule
and
also
a
rule
of
a
medical
profession
widely
and
generally
and
always
accepted
apparently
claimed,
the
medical
testimony
we
have,
both
a
written
and
a
general
rule.
it
can
actually
--
it
makes
think
right
now
about
this
pretty
lady
in
uniform
that
he'd
been
talking
to,
she
(inaudible)
--
she
testified
about
that
bulletin
board
--
about
that
rule
--
the
written
rule
being
on
a
bulletin
board.
this
is
the
pretty
lady
in
uniform
that
mr.
nulman
is
talking
about.
she
appeared
from
someplace
in
the
united
states
as
a
member
of
the
air
force
and
she
had
her
uniform
when
she
came
here.
she
was
a
member
of
the
air
force
and
was
wearing
her
uniform.
she
came
from
her
post
with
special
leave
to
come
here.
that's
the
pretty
lady
in
uniform.
mr.
chester
bordeau
what?
mr.
chester
bordeau
the
bulletin
board
right
outside
the
operating
room
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
in
this
hospital,
in
this
hospital
in
dhahran,
saudi
arabia.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
that's
what
i'm
coming
to
your
honor,
i
want
to
tell
--
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that.
on
the
--
the
examination
before
trial,
he
said
he
didn't
need
any
of
these
pre-laboratory
tests.
he
had
looked
at
the
boy,
the
boy
was
healthy.
he
didn't
need
any
of
these.
this
pretty
girl
in
uniform
who
was
a
nurse
in
the
operating
room
said
that
she
was
there
--
she
was
attending
--
was
there
and
sought
that
there
was
no
laboratory
tests
and
that
dr.
farmer
was
told
that
he
should
not
conduct
the
examination
without
the
benefit
of
these
pre-laboratory
test.
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
--
mr.
nulman,
i
think
you
may
recall
in
his
statement
your
honor,
he
talks
about
our
colleague,
this
extravaganza.
he
was
talking
about
a
pretty
girl
in
uniform.
you
may
remember
he
saying
that,
but
that's
the
girl
he's
talking
about,
and
it
is
not
an
extravaganza.
it
was
required
that
we
produce
witness
who
could
relate
the
facts
as
the
jury
finally
believed,
believed
the
facts
as
to
the
reason
for
dr.
farmer's
discharge.
mr.
chester
bordeau
in
fact
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh
yes!
in
fact
there
was.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
it
was
in
process.
dr.
farmer
had
been
requested
by
nurse
swanson,
who
also
testified
at
the
trial,
to
wait
five
or
ten
minutes
that
the
test
had
been
taken
they
were
in
the
process
of
being
developed,
but
he
waived
--
he
said
there's
no
occasion
to
wait.
and
she
was
an
anesthetist
and
she
wouldn't
attend
on
the
operation.
she
said,
“rules
require
it
that
we
have
these
tests
before
any
operation
is
performed”.
and
he
said,
“well,
i
don't
need
you”.
and
then
what
dr.
farmer
did
even
in
violation
of
another
rule
or
another
practice
in
the
medical
practice
at
least,
he
performed
the
operation
and
administered
the
anesthesia
simultaneously.
our
medical
testimony
to
which
i
will
refer
later
indicates
that
that
is
the
most
hazardous
proceeding
for
any
surgeon
to
engage
in
no
matter
how
long
or
how
short
the
operation
may
be.
that
he
said
he
could
do
both
that
he
could
observe
whatever
is
necessary
to
observe
in
the
giving
of
anesthesia
and
he
can
perform
the
operation
of
both
eyes
of
this
arab
boy
at
the
same
time.
i'll
talk
about
the
medical
angle
as
i
go
on,
there's
some
very
serious
implications
involved.
mr.
chester
bordeau
mister
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
nulman
is
referring
to
dr.
bourne.
dr.
bourne
was
an
assistant
medical
director.
he
was
stationed
from
time
to
time
in
saudi
arabia
and
sometimes
in
the
united
states.
the
medical
director
was
dr.
page
who
is
located
and
stationed
in
dhahran,
saudi
arabia.
he
was
called
and
he
testified
about
this
bulletin
board
and
about
this
rule.
now
dr.
bourne
testified
as
mr.
nulman
has
stated,
now
he
was
not
the
chief
as
noted
by
mr.
nulman
in
his
brief,
he
was
an
assistant
administrative
officer
on
the
administrative
staff
in
saudi
arabia.
the
medical
director
was
dr.
page.
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
was
there
from
time
to
time
your
honor.
he
was
in
new
york
and
he
was
in
saudi
arabia.
now,
he
said
he
didn't
recall
having
seen
such
a
rule
on
the
bulletin
board.
dr.
page
did,
dr.
lonus
(ph)
who
was
the
chief
of
surgery
did,
neil
nurse,
this
pretty
girl
in
uniform
she
did,
and
the
nurse
--
the
anesthetist
swanson
who
was
in
the
operating
room,
she
did.
and
we
also
have
on
that
very
score
your
honor
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
this
question.
after
this
occurrence
on
this
operation,
dr.
lonus
who
came
here
to
testify
stated
that
after
the
operation
dr.
farmer
admitted
to
him
that
he
had
not
received
the
results
of
these
pre-laboratory
tests.
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
testified
to
that.
he
testified
that
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
pardon?
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
you
see
that's
where
--
i
mean
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
on
this
trial
he
did
this
your
honor.
now,
i
told
you
when
he
testified
to
an
examination
before
trial
he
didn't
have
the
laboratory
test,
he
didn't
need
them,
he
hadn't
seen
them.
mr.
chester
bordeau
now,
at
the
trial
he
testified
this
way.
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes
he
did.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
was
one
of
the
disputes.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
he
did
not
testify
that
he
waited.
he
said
he
proceeded
with
the
surgery
because
it
wasn't
necessary
to
have
these
results.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
this
was
on
the
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
examination
before
trial.
mr.
chester
bordeau
at
the
trial,
now
he
changed
the
testimony
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
now,
--
at
the
trial
he
testified
that
he
didn't
have
the
results
contrary
to
what
he
testified
to
in
the
examination
for
a
trial.
mr.
chester
bordeau
were
negative.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh
yes!
now,
but
he
testified
the
point
that
i'm
making
with
respect
to
this
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
yes!
judge
palmieri
heard
this.
now
he
changed,
as
i
said,
the
testimony
on
the
trial.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
i
want
to
emphasize
this
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
the
--
comes
the
second
trial
that
follow
through
on
that.
so
on
the
first
trial,
he
said
he
got
the
results
from
a
nurse,
a
lebanese
nurse
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
but
we
hadn't
heard,
i've
never
heard
of
(inaudible)
before.
but
we
got
in
touch
with
(inaudible)
over
in
saudi
arabia
and
we
had
him
flown
over
here
on
this
first
trial
to
find
what
the
facts
were.
and
(inaudible)
took
the
stand
here
in
new
york
and
he
said,
“i
never
gave
him
the
results
of
any
such
tests.
that
is
not
true
and
i
--
the
fact
is
that
i
never
gave
him.
i'm
never
in
the
position
to
give
him
because
the
operation
was
over
by
the
time
i
have
the
results.”
now,
this
is
on
a
second
trial
--
this
on
the
first
trial.
and
then
on
the
second
trial,
mind
you
this,
on
the
second
trial
realizing
that
we
had
gotten
the
testimony
of
(inaudible)
hurriedly
and
suddenly
under
the
surprise
information
that
we
have
given
by
dr.
farmer
as
to
--
he
didn't
get
the
results
from
mr.
(inaudible),
so
we
--
as
i've
said
we've
flew
him
over
here.
but
on
the
second
trial,
he
took
it
--
well,
we
had
mr.
(inaudible)
so
he
changed
the
testimony
a
little
bit
again.
on
the
second
trial
he
says
that
--
i
asked
him
that,
“where
did
you
get
this
information
about
the
test
before
the
conducting
of
the
examination?”
oh,
he
said
it
was
from
the
nurse.
and
i
asked
him
whether
the
name
that
nurse,
(inaudible)?
“well,
i'm
not
sure”,
he
says
on
the
second
trial.
it
may
have
been
another
nurse.
and
i
tried
to
pin
him
down
on
it
and
say,
“now,
isn't
it
more
than
an
impression?
didn't
you
testify
on
the
first
trial
here
that
it
was
(inaudible)
and
you
were
positive
about
it?”
“well,
you
said
that
you're
leading
me
on
mr.
bordeau,
you're
leading
me
on”.
but
i
said,
“what
is
the
fact
--
what
is
the
fact?
well,
he
said
it
may,
this
is
the
second
trial,
“it
may
have
been
--
maybe
it
was
another
nurse”.
well,
we
don't
know
who
he's
talking
about
then
and
we
try
to
have
anybody
available
that
could
possibly
contradict
this
man's
shifting
testimony
from
time
to
time
from
examination
before
trial
to
--
first
trial
to
second
trial,
the
very
difficult
thing
to
meet
all
these
shiftings
in
the
testimony
in
this
plaintiff.
now
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
correct.
mr.
chester
bordeau
now
the
cost,
the
large
--
their
items
of
cost
here
are
probably
two
items
or
two
categories
of
items.
one
is
the
transportation
of
the
witnesses,
that's
number
one.
and
the
other
is
the
transcript,
transcript
of
deposition,
the
transcripts
of
testimony
taken
during
the
trial.
now,
i
say
that
the
transcripts
were
necessary
particularly,
and
i
say
particularly
on
the
first
and
the
second
trial
for
that
matter.
but
on
the
first
trial
these
minutes
were
ordered
with
the
approval
of
the
court.
they
were
used
by
the
court
from
day
to
day.
they
were
used
in
checking
the
record
with
mr.
nulman
who
was
in
many
disagreement,
many
dis
--
engaged
in
many
disagreements
with
the
trial
judge
as
to
what
happened
from
day
to
day.
and
judge
palmieri
had
the
record
before
him
and
read
the
record
to
him
to
correct
his
recollection
of
the
record.
and
that
daily
transcript
proved
to
be
very
important
and
very
necessary
in
the
defense
of
this
action.
it
was
also
used
by
the
jury
in
wanting
to
know
the
answers
that
had
been
given
to
various
questions
by
the
witness
farmer
and
by
other
witnesses.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
think
that
daily
transcript
is
vitally
important
your
honor
in
a
case
where
were
faced
with
a
shifting
witness.
mind
you
here
was
one
man
whose
--
that
involved
ten
or
20
people
in
his
various
contacts
with
the
defendant.
he
could
pick
out
whoever
he
thought
would
might
--
what
might
not
--
who
might
not
be
available
and
we
would
have
to
run,
as
we
did
with
(inaudible),
run
to
saudi
arabia
fast
and
get
him
here
in
order
to
use
on
the
trial.
we
are
dealing
with
a
witness
of
that
kind.
we
had
been
warned
on
the
first
trial
of
what
he
had
done
and
i
think
it
is
only
fair
that
we
should've
been
prepared
for
the
second
trial
by
having
those
witnesses
available
who
could
testify
to
what
we
thought
was
everything
he
could
say.
but
he
could
shift
and
shift
and
shift,
and
there
was
another
shift
even
on
the
second
trial.
there
was
a
shift
with
respect
to
the
charge
made
for
the
first
time.
this
is
after
an
examination
before
trial.
this
is
after
first
trial.
and
on
the
third
trial
the
charges
made
that
the
defendant
had
falsified
his
records
relating
to
this
arab
boy,
and
maybe
the
record
that
we
had
related
to
another
boy,
may
it
--
not
this
arab
boy.
mr.
chester
bordeau
pardon?
mr.
chester
bordeau
on
the
second
trial.
mr.
chester
bordeau
two,
they're
on
the
second
trial
and
made
this
charge
that
we
had
changed
these
records.
now
these
are
very
serious
charges
to
make
against
anybody
whether
the
amount
involved
is
$5
or
$5
million.
these
are
serious
charges
to
be
made
and
they
should
be
meted
effectively
as
possible.
and
we
so
--
but
we've
thought
to
be
the
most
effective
means
of
meeting
these
very
serious
grave
charges
made
against
this
defendant.
and
i
think
that
the
daily
transcripts
were
very
vital
and
very
important
and
necessary
and
it
--
for
the
defendant
in
the
defense
of
this
action.
now
with
respect
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
now
with
respect
to
the
witnesses,
i
think
what
i
have
said
it
--
here
before
indicates
the
importance
of
having
those
witnesses
available
in
new
york
physically,
live
where
they
could
be
seen
by
a
jury
to
state
the
facts
with
respect
to
these
serious
charges
made
by
this
dr.
farmer.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
you've
got
the
minutes
of
the
trials,
your
honor,
it's
two
trials.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
could
calculate
that
in
a
minute,
i
don't
have
the
figure
ready
at
hand.
it's
a
--
i
have
it
in
the
record.
i
think
we
have
indicated
by
what
i
have
said
that
the
attendance
of
these
witnesses
was
an
important
and
was
a
necessary
thing
for
us
to
do
in
the
defense
of
this
action.
and
i
say
that
any
rule
that
should
be
formulated
should
be
a
rule
that
will
permit
a
party
litigant
to
be
reimbursed
for
any
necessary
expenses
in
the
defense
or
the
prosecution
of
an
action.
and
if
the
discretion
to
be
used
by
the
court
should
be
limited
to
whether
or
not
the
expense
incurred
were
necessary
to
the
prosecution
or
defense
of
the
action.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that
was
after
the
first
trial
your
honor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes
sir.
that's
not
involved
on
this
appeal.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
do.
i
don't
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
and
i
think
it's
an
informed
discretion
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
no.
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
all
the
applications
as
i
understand
it
that
the
100
mile
rule,
in
the
allowance
by
some
courts
of
costs
limited
to
the
extent
of
100
miles
from
the
place
of
trial
emerged
from
a
consideration
of
rule
45
(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
relating
to
the
subpoena
power.
and
that
section
permits
the
service
of
a
subpoena
within
the
district
where
the
court
is
sitting
or
within
100
miles
of
the
place
where
the
court
is
sitting.
that
45
(e)
appears
at
page
2a
of
my
appendix.
some
way
or
other,
the
judges
or
the
courts
started
to
apply
the
rule
with
regards
to
the
extent
of
the
subpoena
power
in
saying
as
to
what
cost
were
recoverable.
in
other
words
that
subpoena
--
only
insofar
as
the
subpoena
could
issue
could
a
court
assess
costs
against
the
party
for
having
someone
to
attend
at
the
trial.
and
there
is
nothing
in
45
(e)
--
there
is
nothing
in
45
(e)
of
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
would
suggest
any
such
thing.
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
other
provisions
of
law
which
suggest
any
such
thing.
there
is
nothing
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
suggest
any
such
thing.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
some
courts
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
some
courts
felt
they
were
bound
and
i
think
others
did
as
your
honor
suggests
that
they
felt
that
would
be
a
way
of
doing
it,
but
there
is
nothing
to
justify.
that's
what
i
say
is
not
a
legal
reason
for
the
exercise
of
a
discretion
this
way
or
the
other.
that
is
not
a
reason.
the
fact
that
a
court
may
issue
or
may
tax
cost
for
subpoena
fees
is
not
a
reason
why
the
rule
should
be
limited
to
that.
there
is
nothing
anywhere
in
the
law
that
provides
that
accepts
some
construction
of
some
courts
with
respect
to
this.
and
i
say
that
the
appli
--
of
the
application
of
a
100-mile
expense
is
not
justified,
had
not
ever
been
justified.
mr.
chester
bordeau
do
i
have
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
mr.
justice,
i
haven't
counted
but
i
think
there
are
eight
number
both
ways.
mr.
chester
bordeau
a
great
number
both
ways.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
haven't
--
i
have
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
--
maybe
i
should've
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
prepared
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes.
mr.
chester
bordeau
(inaudible)
mr.
chester
bordeau
since
1948,
when
1821
was
amended
as
we
were
discussing
a
few
minutes
ago.
it
is
my
recollection
that
all
of
the
cases
decided
except
judge
weinfeld's
decision
here
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
have
all
determined
that
the
100-mile
limitation
is
not
applicable.
mr.
chester
bordeau
an
american
citizen?
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
that
wouldn't
apply
to
a
principle
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
it
wouldn't
apply
to
our
principle.
mr.
chester
bordeau
it
wouldn't
apply
to
a
principle.
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i
read
that
amendment
to
your
honor
to
suggest
--
i've
only
got
five
minutes
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
yes,
what
i
said
(inaudible)
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
--
the
interpretation
i
placed
on
8
20
--
1821
is
that
it's
a
suggestion
or
a
deduction
which
could
be
made
from
the
use
of
their
statute
by
congress
to
indicate
that
expenses
other
than
those
that
are
--
come
within
a
subpoena
power
are
certainly
taxable.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
i
do
not.
and
i
think
the
other
statutes
support
us.
the
foundation
for
the
argument
which
we
have
made
that
is
sections
1920
and
rule
45
--
54.
now
my
time
is
coming
to
an
end
and
i
would
like
to
make
this
last
observation.
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal
--
the
court
of
appeals,
the
reference
was
made
by
chief
judge
lumbard
to
the
effect
that
a
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
could
take
into
consideration
the
relative
wealth
of
the
parties.
i
think
that
that
suggestion
is
a
suggestion
which
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
i
think
that
there
can
only
be
one
application
of
the
rules.
they
would
have
to
apply
to
those
with
wealth
and
they
would
have
to
apply
to
those
without
wealth.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
words
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
a
lecture
given
by
him
before
the
new
york
university
school
of
law.
i
think
it
was
the
james
madison
lecture
given
on
february
11th,
1964.
there,
judge
--
mr.
justice
goldberg
after
referring
to
some
very
pertinent
and
words
of
mr.
justice
black
as
follows
providing
equal
justice
for
poor
and
rich,
weak
and
powerful
alike
is
an
age
old
problem,
those
are
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
to
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred.
and
then
mr.
justice
goldberg
went
on
to
say,
“here
is
another
aspect
of
equality.
we
derive
our
constitutional
inspiration
from
the
bible.”
and
he
quotes,
he
quotes
from
the
third
book
of
moses,
leviticus,
“you
shall
do
no
injustice
in
judgment.
you
shall
not
be
partial
to
the
poor
or
defer
to
the
great,
but
in
righteousness
shall
you
judge
your
neighbor”.
that
is
the
end
of
the
quotation
but
mr.
justice
goldberg
proceeds.
justices
of
our
court
and
many
state
courts
take
an
oath
to
do
equal
justice
to
the
poor
and
to
the
rich.
and
i
say
that
we
cannot
have
a
rule
which
would
say
because
you
are
wealthy
or
you
are
--
you're
entire
cost
can
be
taxed
against
you
and
if
you
are
not
as
wealthy
or
wealthy,
that
costs
shall
not
be
taxed
against
you.
i
think
with
those
remarks,
i
see
the
red
light
and
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
he
should
be
your
honor,
for
that
--
but
may
state
my
reason
for
that?
mr.
chester
bordeau
very
briefly.
mr.
chester
bordeau
very
briefly
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
rule
where
a
second
judge
while
he
might
--
he
should
probably
give
great
respect
to
what
his
brother
judge
has
said
in
the
disposition
of
any
preliminary
motions.
i
think
he
still
has
the
power
and
the
right
if
he
is
convinced
that
an
earlier
ruling
is
completely
erroneous.
but
i
don't
think
that
rule
applies
here
where
you
got
a
judge
who
sat
during
a
trial
from
10
or
12
days,
had
occasioned
to
observe
what
was
necessary
and
not
necessary
that
his
rulings
should
be
reversed
by
a
judge
who
did
not
sit
on
that
trial.
i
think
that
is
error
for
the
second
judge
to
do
that.
i
think
the
judge
who
sat
on
the
trial
who
was
able
to
observe
what
occurred
is
the
one
that
should
fix
those
costs.
and
if
they
should
not
be
reversed
by
a
judge
who
did
not
sit
on
that
first
trial,
i
think
that's
wrong.
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
was
not
reversed
on
that.
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
was
reversed
on
a
statute
of
frauds
question.
statute
of
frauds
question
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
two
years
later
reversed
itself
in
favor
of
what
judge
palmieri
had
done.
mr.
chester
bordeau
i
think
it
was
a
consideration
in
his
mind
if
you
read
those
opinion.
i
think
you
might
deduce
that.
otherwise,
probably
it
wouldn't
be
mentioned.
mr.
chester
bordeau
otherwise,
why
should
--
should
any
mention
be
made
of
it?
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
don't
have
to
tell
us
about
rich
and
poor
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
wouldn't
have
to
tell
us
about
rich
and
poor
then,
would
you?
mr.
chester
bordeau
he
wouldn't
have
to
tell
us
about
the
rich
and
the
poor.
mr.
chester
bordeau
why
would
he?
mr.
chester
bordeau
well,
i
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
oh,
i
don't
think
that's
necessary.
mr.
chester
bordeau
no,
i
don't
think
that's
necessary
but
i
think
the
statement
from
this
court
that
any
--
the
use
of
any
fact
or
in
the
dis
--
exercise
of
discretion
by
a
court
that's
based
on
the
comparative
wealth
of
the
party
is
not
a
proper
consideration.
that
would
not
be
out
of
order.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
mr.
chester
bordeau
but
you
don't
tax
your
opponent
with
it.
in
further
answer
to
what
your
honor
has
just
stated,
it's
been
stated
--
we're
denying
access
to
the
courts.
that's
not
so
by
the
application
of
the
rule
that
i
advocate.
there
isn't
a
denial
of
access
to
the
courts.
the
fact
is
that
you
take
poor
litigants,
if
a
poor
litigant
had
a
worthy
cause
that
he
didn't
have
the
prospect
of
collecting
the
cost
that
he
would
have
to
incur
in
a
transportation
of
witnesses
from
far
away,
he
would
be
denied.
he
would
be
denied,
effectively
denied
the
use
of
the
court
and
that
applies
to
a
poor
defendant
who
couldn't
call
for
witness
and
expect
to
be
repaid.
so
the
rule
should
permit
the
payment
of
expenses
that
are
necessarily
exerted
by
the
--
by
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant,
whether
they're
poor
or
they're
rich.
mr.
chester
bordeau
from
my
own?
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
now
my
only
suggestion
about
that
is
that
there
should
be
a
limitation
on
the
exercise
of
that
discretion.
and
that
discretion
should
be
limited
by
finding
out
or
in
determining
what
is
necessary
and
reasonable
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
--
that
the
exercise
--
mr.
chester
bordeau
that's
right.
and
in
this
case,
in
further
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
white,
judge
weinfeld
on
the
second
trial
didn't
deny
cost
on
the
ground
that
these
witnesses
were
not
necessary.
he
allowed
$16
but
he
must
have
found
they
were
necessary
otherwise
he
shouldn't
have
allowed
that.
mr.
chester
bordeau
there
is
a
statement
to
that
effect
in
that
opinion.
thank
you
your
honors.
