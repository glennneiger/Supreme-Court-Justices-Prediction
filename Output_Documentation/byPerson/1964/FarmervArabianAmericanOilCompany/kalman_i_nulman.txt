mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
these
cases
are
here
by
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
subject
is
that
of
costs
awarded
in
a
breach
of
contract
of
employment
action
after
a
second
jury
trial
which
in
the
first
instance
amounted
to
somewhat
under
$12,000.
our
--
the
principle
question
which
presents
itself
to
this
court
is
how
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
100-mile
limitation
on
witness
fees
which
may
be
taxed
after
trial.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
no,
sir,
the
larger.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
question
of
discretion
i
believe
was
merely
a
vehicle
which
enabled
the
court
of
appeals
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
action
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
question
of
discretion
is
the
real
question
in
the
case.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
the
larger
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
well
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
i
argued
this,
your
honor
did
in
the
court
below
and
the
majority
adopted
what
i
considered
to
be
an
extraordinary
view
and
said
that
the
failure
of
the
second
trial
judge
to
accept
a
concededly
erroneous
holding
by
the
first
trial
judge
constituted
such
an
abusive
discretion
as
brought
within
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
that
it
was
appealable
as
of
right.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
i
would
say
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
well,
i
would
say
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
be
correct.
in
this
court
by
reason
of
the
term
this
case
has
taken.
by
reason
of
the
holding
below
that
the
failure
of
one
judge
to
follow
the
holding
of
another
judge
constitutes
an
abuse
of
discretion.
i
think
we're
here
in
a
totally
different
posture.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
well,
if
you
don't
agree
with
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
if
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
if
you
don't
agree
with
it.
it
still
leaves
what
i
consider
to
be
the
vital
question
that
requires
determination
which
is
why
the
congress
in
enacting
in
1954,
legislation
which
increased
the
amount
of
allowable
fees
to
a
witness
intended
to
abrogate
the
long
standing
traditional
limitation
of
a
100-miles
and
to
usher
in
a
theory
of
costs
that's
wholly
alien
to
the
theory
which
has
prevailed
in
this
county
and
which
would
have
the
effect
of
closing
the
doors
of
our
court
to
the
large
numbers
of
our
citizens.
and
i
think
regardless
of
whether
or
not
congress
so
intended
or
to
put
it
differently
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
congress
did
not
so
intend.
the
fact
is
that
under
the
expressed
authority
conferred
upon
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
new
rules
of
enacting
rules
for
civil
causes
this
court
could
still
abrogate
that
100-mile
limitation
if
it
should
believe
it
to
be
a
benefit
--
a
reason.
but
the
whole
of
this
case
while
it
turns
on
the
conflict
between
the
circuits
really
brings
up
a
question
that
i
believe
that
required
authority
to
determination
almost
since
the
founding
of
this
country.
the
theory,
of
course,
has
been
characterized
by
many
of
our
text
writers
by
many
of
our
judges
as
a
jungle
which
makes
no
sense
and
which
has
been
permitted
like
toxic
growth
and
which
has
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
it.
as
i
say
our
principle
contention
here
is
that
unless
the
100-mile
limitation
is
upheld
the
great
number
of
our
citizens
will
be
unable
to
litigate.
first,
because
they'll
be
unable
to
pay
the
price
of
admission
to
our
courthouse
in
the
form
of
a
bond
or
costs,
second,
because
they
won't
be
able
to
afford
the
cost
of
litigating
itself
and
finally,
because
they
would
be
extremely
reluctant
to
undertake
a
lawsuit
which
if
they
should
not
prevail
would
result
in
their
financial
ruin.
now
the
defendant,
the
arabian
american
oil
company
has
cross-petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari
on
a
single
question
which
it
proposed
in
its
petition,
which
was
based
on
the
alleged
discrimination
of
the
district
judge
against
arabian
american
oil
company
because
it
was
as
the
defendant
put
it
in
quotes
“a
rich
litigant”.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
district
court
never
used
any
such
language,
never
made
any
such
determination.
there
is
no
such
issue
in
the
case
and
this
question
which
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
is
not
present
in
any
shape
or
form.
and
it's
--
for
that
reason
that
in
our
brief
i
indicated
that
i
proposed
to
move
for
dismissal
of
the
defendant's
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
improvidently
granted.
now
the
facts
of
these,
dr.
farmer,
a
medical
doctor
specializing
in
ophthalmology,
saw
in
the
medical
journal
what
they
certainly
designate
as
a
“blind
advertisement”.
that
is
to
say,
it
does
not
purport
to
emanate
from
any
identifiable
person
but
merely
from
a
box
member,
which
solicited
a
qualified
ophthalmology
for
employment
in
its
installation
in
saudi
arabia.
the
requirements
were
that
the
applicant
fee
under
a
certain
age
because
they
wanted
a
long
term
career
employee
and
other
qualifications
which
dr.
farmer
thought
he
had
met.
in
response
to
his
letter,
he
was
called
by
one
(inaudible)
who,
except
for
the
initial
contact
in
the
case
never
again
appeared,
who
referred
him
to
a
dr.
allen,
the
chief
of
the
defendant's
medical
installation
in
this
country
and
following
certain
meetings
and
negotiations
and
discussions.
dr.
allen
employed
dr.
farmer,
and
dr.
farmer
entered
upon
his
employment.
after
several
months
he
was
discharged.
he
came
to
new
york,
consulted
our
local
bar
association
who
referred
him
to
mr.
homans,
who
thereupon
started
a
suit
in
1956
in
the
new
york
supreme
court
for
$4000.
on
the
defendant's
application
and
petition
for
removal,
this
cost
was
removed
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
complaint
contained
a
single
cause
of
action.
it
alleged
an
oral
contract
of
employment
or
do
--
of
the
duration
of
the
operation
by
the
defendant
of
its
wells
in
saudi
arabia,
the
breach
of
the
contract
and
damages
in
the
sum
of
$4000.
defendant's
answer
initially
consisted
of
a
general
denial.
appended
to
that
answer
was
a
document
signed
by
the
plaintiff
and
of
course
of
his
processing
some
two
or
three
months
after
he
claims
to
have
been
employed
by
dr.
allen.
and
it
was
the
defendant's
claim
that
dr.
farmer
had
not
been
employed
under
the
oral
arrangement
as
alleged
but
that
he'd
been
alleged
--
employed
under
this
writing
appended
to
the
answer.
about
two
years
later,
after
all
of
the
preliminary
procedures
had
been
completed,
examinations
before
trial
and
so
forth,
the
defendant
applied
for
leave
to
amend
its
answer
to
plea
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
frauds.
and
in
connection
with
it,
urged
that
our
cause
was
not
ready
to
be
placed
upon
the
calendar
for
trial
and
it
should
not
be
so
placed.
after
that
motion
had
been
granted
and
defendant
had
amended
its
answer
to
plea
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
frauds
and
on
the
day
that
the
cause
appeared
on
the
calendar
for
trial,
the
defendant
came
in
and
applied
to
amend
its
answer
again
to
plea
the
defense
of
justifiable
cause
for
the
discharge.
that
motion
was
granted
and
the
case
was
removed
from
the
calendar
and
wasn't
reached
until
a
year
later.
i
think
i
should
state
to
this
court
that
in
the
defendant's
answering
brief
which
i
saw
for
the
first
time
on
friday.
they
state
concerning
the
statements
i
have
just
made
that
they
are
untrue.
now
in
that
regard,
i
consulted
the
record
on
file
on
this
office
and
i
asked
our
opponents
whether
they
didn't
wish
to
discuss
with
me
the
rather
serious
assertion
that
we
had
made
untruthful
statements
in
our
brief.
and
they
said,
no,
that
they
prefer
to
rest
on
the
record.
i
had
hoped
to
obviate
the
need
for
bringing
this
to
the
court's
attention.
as
a
result
of
that,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
order
filed
in
this
court
with
the
record
on
appeal
by
judge
weinfeld,
which
is
number
1586
in
the
record
on
appeal.
in
which
judge
weinfeld
granted
the
motion
to
amend
the
answer
to
plead
the
defense
of
statute
of
frauds
and
that
order
was
dated
march
20,
1958.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
that
sir
is
in
the
printed
and
typewritten
record
which
is
on
file
in
this
court
and
the
particular
order
is
typewritten.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
no,
sir.
it's
not
in
the
transcript
but
merely
in
the
record
on
file.
now,
i
also
call
attention
to
number
1607,
an
order
dated
april
15,
1958
made
by
chief
judge
ryan
of
the
united
states
district
court,
which
recites
that
the
cause
having
appeared
on
the
calendar
of
the
court
and
an
application
having
been
made
by
the
defendant
believed
to
amend
its
answer
to
allege
to
the
defense
of
just
cause
for
the
discharge
and
granting
that
motion.
now,
i
believe
that
some
explanation
is
due
to
the
court
while
the
characterization
of
our
statement
as
untrue.
i
also
and
our
brief
said,
that
a
year
later
after
the
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
we
had
completed
our
opening
to
the
jury.
the
defendant
for
the
first
time
in
its
opening
to
the
jury
injected
a
third
defense
of
lack
of
authority
to
hire
for
the
term
alleged.
now
as
in
the
case
of
previous
statement,
the
defendant
in
its
brief
asserts
that
this
statement
is
untrue
and
refers
for
the
fact
that
we
give
no
folio
reference
for
that
statement.
taking
the
latter
part
first,
it's
true
we
give
no
folio
statement.
and
the
reason
we
give
no
folio
statement
is
that
on
five
previous
separate
occasions
including
a
brief
filed
in
this
court
in
connection
with
a
prior
application
made
for
certiorari
on
another
phase
of
this
case.
we
made
the
identical
assertions
and
in
the
brief
filed
in
this
court,
we
gave
the
folio
reference
where
this
was
found.
and
i
have
the
folio
reference
here,
it's
on
page
16
of
the
transcript
of
the
first
trial
record.
what
i
didn't
say
in
my
brief
and
would
like
to
tell
this
court
is
that
after
they
had
in
their
opening
to
the
jury
injected
this
third
defense,
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
they
elaborated
upon
that
defense
and
proved
not
alone
that
there
was
no
one
in
defendant's
employ
who
had
authority
to
hire
for
the
term
alleged.
but
that
dr.
allen
had
no
authority
to
employ
dr.
farmer
but
that
one
j.
mcdonald
in
charge
of
its
new
york
office
was
the
only
one
who
had
such
authority.
now
at
the
time
that
this
third
defense
as
later
elaborated
was
injected
into
the
trial,
dr.
farmer
had
the
choice
of
pleading
surprise
and
causing
a
mistrial
with
the
disruption
and
additional
expense
that
he
could
not
afford
or
proceeding
with
the
trial
and
doing
the
best
that
he
could
under
the
circumstances
and
we
elected
to
do
that.
after
a
trial
of
about
ten
days,
the
jury
after
deliberating
11
hours
was
unable
to
reach
agreement
and
the
jury
was
discharged.
thereupon,
the
defendant
moved
for
judgment
dismissing
the
plaintiff's
complaint.
the
grounds
on
which
they
moved
were
the
lack
of
authority.
the
parole
evidence
rule
which
they
said
precluded
evidence
of
the
terms
of
the
contract
as
we
alleged
them,
the
cause
of
the
writing
appended
to
their
answer,
and
the
statute
of
frauds.
we
pointed
out
to
the
learned
trial
judge
that
two
of
these
grounds,
the
statute
of
frauds
and
parole
evidence
rule
had
been
separately
argued
on
motions
for
summary
judgment
made
before
different
judges
not
long
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
trial
and
denied
by
them.
and
the
response
made
by
the
defendant
was
that
the
rule
prevailing
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
was
that
one
judge
was
not
bound
by
the
intermediate
rulings
of
other
judges.
the
irony
of
that
is
that
at
the
later
date
when
costs
were
being
reviewed
by
the
second
trial
judge,
the
defendant
came
in
with
equally
respectable
authority
in
support
of
the
contention
that
second
judges
should
honor
the
previous
determination
of
other
judges
in
the
interest
of
comity
and
orderly
procedure.
i
talk
of
this
in
consistent
position
not
--
this
was
by
any
means
the
only
such
in
this
case.
but
to
portray
the
way
this
defendant
played
fast
and
loose
with
the
courts
and
with
us.
the
trial
court
dismissed
our
complaint
on
all
three
grounds
and
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
thereafter,
four
years
and
two
months
after
the
commencement
of
action,
defendant
applied
to
require
the
plaintiff
to
furnish
a
bond
for
security
of
costs.
now,
i
should
like
your
honors
to
interrupt
my
narrative
for
just
one
moment.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
your
honor,
one
of
the
points
that
we
make
is
that
unless
the
costs
are
limited,
it
will
enable
oppression
by
defendants
such
as
arabian
american
oil
company
or
plaintiffs
similarly
situated
to
us
of
the
kind
that
--
to
which
we
have
been
subjected.
now,
i
am
interrupting
in
order
to
call
attention
to
something
that
the
defendant
might
wish
to
verify
in
the
--
of
interval
between
now
and
tomorrow.
in
our
brief,
we
made
reference
to
a
quotation
by
the
district
judge,
the
second
trial
judge,
who
was
an
example
of
the
three
and
easy
manner
of
expenditure
by
this
defendant,
talked
of
an
incident
where
the
defendant
in
an
argument
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
had
ordered
the
minutes
of
that
hearing
which
the
cause
of
which
were
taxed
by
the
first
trial
judge
although,
those
minutes
hadn't
been
requested
or
required.
in
their
reply
brief,
the
defendant
says
that
the
trial
judge,
the
first
trial
judge,
had
passed
upon
the
matter
and
had
said
--
i'm
reading
from
page
3
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner
and
they
make
a
quotation
which
they
say
is
applicable
to
the
particular
item
we've
talked
about.
i've
verified
the
record
on
appeal,
the
three
pretrial
hearings
that
is
--
that
are
mentioned
in
this
excerpt
are
three
separate
pretrial
hearings
of
january
22,
1959,
february
6,
1959,
and
may
7,
1959,
all
of
which
have
been
typewritten
are
on
file
in
this
court
and
have
to
do
only
with
pretrial
hearings
before
the
first
trial
judge
and
do
not
include
the
minutes
we
have
mentioned.
now,
i
have
mentioned
this
at
somewhat
greater
length
that
i
had
intended
in
order
to
point
out
the
fact
that
in
a
simple
breach
of
contract
of
employment
action,
we
are
here
almost
nine
years
and
many,
many
thousands
of
dollars
later,
still
litigating,
unable
to
disengage
ourselves
and
it's
our
feeling
that
something
must
be
wrong
with
rules
of
court
that
unless
a
litigant
in
this
kind
of
activity
and
what's
more
to
the
point
if
anything
can
be
done
to
forestall
a
repetition
of
it.
i
think
it
will
be
in
the
interests
of
our
country
and
of
justice.
now,
after
the
application
was
made
for
a
bond
for
security
--
for
costs,
we
opposed
that
motion
and
argued
first
latches.
second,
that
we
had
in
the
four
years
and
two
months
incurred
over
$3000
in
disbursements,
not
counting
counsel
fees,
and
that
if
we
knew
that
we
were
required
to
furnish
a
substantial
bond
for
security
of
cost
--
for
cost
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation
we
might
have
determined
not
to
bring
it
rather
than
be
confronted
with
the
need
for
filing
a
substantial
bond
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
well,
it
has
this
to
do
with
it,
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
second
appeal
made
very
pointed
reference
to
what
it
considered
to
be
the
expensive
way
in
which
this
defendant
was
conducting
its
litigation
including
the
taking
--
the
bringing
of
witnesses
from
far
off
places.
the
second
trial
judge
in
making
his
determination
was
guided
by
the
expressions
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
occasion.
and
it's
our
position
that
for
the
second
trial
judge
who
had
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
--
who
had
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeal's
expression
before
him
to
disregard
them
in
favor
of
blind
obedience
to
the
first
trial
judge,
who
had
proved
wrong
in
the
matter
of
the
three
grounds
in
which
he
dismissed
our
complaint,
and
who
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
even
in
respect
of
the
bill
of
costs
which
they
said,
“he
should've
blindly
followed,
just
made
no
sense.”
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
may
i
say,
i'm
afraid
that
i
didn't
fully
get
the
import
of
the
question
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
me
yesterday
nor
that
did
i
as
fully
answered
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
as
i
should
have
liked.
and
i
hope
that
i
may
be
permitted
in
the
course
of
my
argument
to
return
to
both
of
these
matters.
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday's
session,
i
had
come
to
the
point
where
following
a
dismissal
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint
after
first
jury
trial
and
a
reversal
and
remand
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
had
been
an
application
made
to
require
the
plaintiff
to
furnish
a
bond
for
security
of
costs
which
was
granted.
and
a
bond
of
$10,000
required
first
modified
to
$6000
and
that
was
followed
by
dismissal
of
plaintiff's
complaint
for
failure
to
furnish
the
bond
which
resulted
in
a
second
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
court
reversed
holding
that
the
requirement
for
the
furnishing
of
the
bond
had
the
effect
of
depriving
the
plaintiff
of
his
day
in
court.
and
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
the
court
volunteered
to
grant
a
pointed
observations
concerning
what
it
described
as
the
expansive
way
of
trying
the
case
which
had
been
followed
by
the
defendant.
and
it
referred
particularly
to
the
bringing
of
witnesses
from
saudi
arabia.
and
judge
clark,
the
late
judge
clark,
speaking
for
the
unanimous
court
indicated
very
plainly
that
the
--
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
having
in
mind
the
various
factors
such
as
the
amount
involved
and
the
condition
of
the
parties,
the
plaintiff,
that
resort
could
have
been
had
and
should
have
been
had
to
the
deposition
procedures
prescribed
by
the
rules.
thereafter,
a
second
trial
was
had
before
judge
weinfeld,
the
jury
in
the
course
of
its
long
deliberations
returned
and
reported
it
was
unable
to
agree
and
after
some
additional
instructions
from
the
court
returned,
deliberated
further,
and
returned
a
verdict
for
the
defendant.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
the
first
was
$10,000
and
the
--
we
applied
for
reargument
and
the
district
judge
reduced
it
to
$6000
and
we
had
made
proof
which
the
court
of
appeals
considered
sufficient
that
we
were
unable
to
furnish
either
such
bond.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
following
the
second
dismissal,
the
defendant
tax
costs
at
the
clerk
--
with
the
clerk
and
these
costs
in
the
first
instance
amounted
to
$11,900.
we
applied
for
review
and
in
due
course,
the
second
trial
judge
after
deliberation
lasting
nine
months
rendered
an
opinion
and
decision
wherein
he
reduced
the
--
by
--
the
costs
to
the
sum
of
some
$800.
and
in
the
course
of
this
opinion,
judge
weinfeld
made
reference
first
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
its
scriptures
on
the
methods
of
trying
the
case
followed
by
the
defendant,
made
his
own
observation
as
to
the
free
and
easy
method
adopted
by
the
defendant
and
that's
the
language
of
the
judge.
and
as
an
instance
of
the
free
and
easy
method
followed
by
the
defendant,
he
gave
the
illustration
of
an
argument
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
about
a
year
prior
to
the
first
trial.
the
defendant
had,
without
any
request
of
the
court
or
any
indication
by
the
court
that
it
desired
a
transcript
of
the
minutes,
had
ordered
the
minutes
of
that
hearing
and
attached
the
cost
of
those
minutes
against
the
plaintiff
at
the
first
trial.
i
might
say
that
the
costs
of
the
first
trial
were
taxed
and
reviewed
while
our
appeal
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
had
already
served
and
filed
our
brief.
the
first
trial
judge
declined
to
stay
the
taxation
but
the
court
of
appeals,
on
our
application,
did
so.
now
judge
weinfeld
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
it
was
two
volumes
of
several
thousands
of
pages,
and
fortunately
for
us
the
defendant
had
ordered
those
minutes
and
had
filed
them
in
the
office
of
the
clerk.
that
is,
the
stenographer
had
filed
his
copy
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
and
we
made
extracts
from
that
record
and
the
actual
printed
record
of
the
appeal
amounted
to
some
60
pages
and
was
this
size.
that
is
to
say
without
the
appendix,
it
was
50
pages
and
there
were
an
additional
74
printed
pages
for
our
principal
brief
and
half
again
as
much
for
our
reply
brief,
and
that
was
the
extent
of
the
printed
record.
as
for
the
actual
court
record,
the
--
it
was
extremely
voluminous
and
the
volume
ran
to,
i
think
and
i
hope
i'm
not
in
error,
1200
to
1300
pages,
that
was
the
first
trial.
and
in
that
regard,
i
might
--
for
the
information
that
the
court
say
that
the
plaintiff
who
was
the
only
live
witness
called
in
his
behalf
took
up
just
the
smallest
part
of
that
on
his
own
direct
examination.
his
cross-examination
consumed
twice
the
extent
of
his
--
it's
direct
and
the
balance
were
taken
up
with
the
witnesses
called
by
the
defendant.
now
judge
weinfeld
said
that
here
was
an
instance
of
the
free
and
easy
approach
to
litigation
followed
by
the
defendant
who
ordered
the
minutes
of
the
argument
of
the
motion
without
any
request
from
the
court
or
any
indication
that
the
court
desired
its
use.
and
the
cost
of
those
minutes
was
taxed
by
the
first
trial
judge
without
any
reference
to
the
actual
judge
who
had
heard
the
motion
as
to
its
necessity.
now
in
our
brief
we
call
attention
to
that
portion
of
judge
weinfeld's
decision
and
the
defendant
replied
that
the
first
trial
judge
had
considered
those
minutes
as
necessary
and
included
a
quotation
from
the
first
trial's
judge's
decision
which
referred
to
three
pretrial
hearings.
while
these
pretrial
hearings
had
no
reference
to
these
particular
minutes
as
i
pointed
out
last
night,
and
they
refer
to
three
separate
pretrial
hearings
at
which
the
minutes
were
taken
and
for
which
costs
were
taxed.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
the
trial
--
the
second
trial
judge
stated
that
in
bringing
this
suit
the
plaintiff
acted
in
good
faith
and
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
live
witnesses
should
be
brought
from
far
off
places,
the
rule
laid
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
--
then
judge
harlan,
that
the
condition
of
the
respected
parties
should
be
taken
into
accounts
as
well
as
the
magnitude
of
the
matters
involved
and
the
subject
of
the
action.
and
that
in
his
opinion,
the
magnitude
and
subject
of
the
action
didn't
require
it,
and
he
said
further
it
well
may
be
that
the
various
procedures
followed
by
the
defendant
served
its
convenience
as
well
as
that
of
its
counsel
but
that
they
were
not
necessary
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
to
impose
a
staggering
burden
of
this
kind
upon
a
defeated
litigant
in
this
situation
of
this
plaintiff
could
well
have
the
effect
of
closing
the
courts
to
a
great
many
litigants.
the
language
is
my
own
but
the
sentiment
was
that
of
the
judge.
before
the
second
trial
judge,
the
defendant
argued
that
it
should
follow
the
previous
determination
of
the
first
judge
as
a
matter
of
comity
and
as
a
matter
of
orderly
procedure
but
he
declined
to
do
so.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
opposed
the
appeal
on
the
ground,
first
that
the
appeal
involved
only
the
matter
of
costs
and
that
the
costs
have
been
determined
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
that
under
these
conditions,
under
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
that
was
not
appealable.
now,
i
might
say
that
in
that
appeal,
the
defendant
did
not
urge
that
there
had
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
nor
did
it
urge
that
the
failure
to
follow
the
first
judge's
determination
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
merely
contended
that
the
first
judge's
determination
should
have
been
followed.
following
the
argument
and
submission
of
that
appeal,
the
appellate
court
apparently
divided
two
to
one
in
favor
of
affirmance,
that
is
judges
hayes
and
smith
voted
for
affirmance,
and
the
chief
judge
voted
for
reversal.
and
they
thought
that
the
importance
of
the
subject
required
that
the
entire
court
be
convened
en
banc
and
that
was
done
and
the
court
in
a
five
to
four
division
voted
to
reverse.
the
chief
judge,
judges
moore,
judge
friendly,
judge
kaufman
and
judge
marshall
voted
with
the
majority.
judge
smith
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
judge
hayes
and
judge
clark
concurred.
judge
clark
wrote
a
separate
concurring
opinion
and
judge
waterman
wrote
an
opinion
of
his
own.
now
i'll
state
judge
waterman's
position
first.
he
believed
that
the
determination
should
be
affirmed,
but
unlike
both
the
majority
and
the
minority,
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
district
judge
should
be
left
with
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
a
given
case
the
exigencies
of
that
particular
case
did
not
require
that
costs
in
a
greater
amount
than
those
prescribed
by
the
rule
or
those
limited
by
the
100-mile
limitation
should
not
be
granted.
now
as
to
that,
i
should
like
to
comment
first
that
i
feel
that
the
right
of
access
to
the
court
is
so
vital
and
so
important
and
that
it
is
a
right
and
not
a
privilege
that
it
should
not
be
left
for
the
determination
of
some
individual
judge,
in
some
circumstances
we
know
nothing
about,
but
which
we
can
imagine
from
this
very
case
as
to
whether
a
litigant
would
be
permitted
to
litigate.
we
think
he
--
every
litigant,
every
person
and
every
citizen
is
entitled
to
litigate
as
a
matter
of
right
and
not
by
reason
of
judicial
favor.
so,
i
get
back
to
the
majority
view.
the
majority
first
commented
on
our
contention
that
this
was
not
appealable.
and
they
said
that
they
believed
that
since
the
enactment
of
these
particular
rules
which
gave
the
district
judge
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
costs
should
be
taxed,
the
rule
previously
laid
down
by
this
court
to
the
effect
that
of
judgments
for
costs
alone
where
the
question
of
discretion
alone
was
involved
was
no
longer
valid.
well,
what
the
majority
overlooked
was
that
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
was
so
laid
down
precisely
because
the
district
judge
had
discretion.
and
they
said
that
because
the
district
court
had
discretion,
a
judgment
for
costs
alone
was
not
appealable.
however,
that
determination
and
this
is
the
part
of
the
answer
that
i
feel
i
should've
given
mr.
justice
goldberg
yesterday.
that
determination
isn't
--
i'm
afraid
before
this
court
although
i've
included
it
as
one
of
the
questions,
in
the
thought
that
if
this
court
wished
to
make
any
comment
on
the
subject
it
would
be
in
the
record.
it's
not
before
the
court
because
that
determination
was
not
essential
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
having
put
its
granting
of
the
right
to
appeal
on
a
totally
different
ground
namely
that
the
failure
of
the
second
judge
to
follow
the
holding
of
the
first
judge
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that
it
was
that
disregard
of
the
law
which
gave
the
defendant
the
right
to
appeal.
therefore,
the
question
as
to
whether
a
purely
discretionary
determination
as
to
cost
was
appealable
or
not,
or
whether
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
was
or
was
not
valid
while
they
passed
upon
it,
it
was
pure
dicta
so
far
as
this
determination
was
concerned.
and
it's
for
that
reason
your
honor
that
i
said
yesterday
that
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
put
the
case
in
a
different
posture
altogether.
and
i
can't
come
here
and
say
that
they
should
never
have
been
given
the
right
to
appeal
because
costs
alone
were
involved,
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
“well,
cost
alone
weren't
involved.
the
requirement
of
law
is
that
you
must
follow
the
decision
of
the
first
judge.”
and
having
violated
that
rule
of
law
there
here
is
a
matter
of
right.
now,
i
get
to
the
point
and
this
is
where
i
should
have
answered
mr.
justice
goldberg's
answer
--
question
in
the
affirmative.
it's
perfectly
true
that
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
determining
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
second
judge
was
bound
to
follow
the
ruling
of
the
first
judge,
there
need
be
no
further
determination
as
to
what
we
considered
to
be
the
main
question
of
this
appeal.
and
i
was
so
obsessed,
i
must
tell
you,
with
the
thought
of
the
importance
of
this
question
that
i
merrily
in
my
own
mind
disregarded
the
other.
and
i
hope
that
this
is
a
more
satisfactory
answer
than
the
one
i
gave
yesterday.
now,
as
to
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
the
various
decisions
and
there
have
been
many
and
various
decision
with
many
and
various
reasons
given
as
to
why
the
100-mile
limitation
should
or
should
not
be
followed.
the
one
that
seemed
to
me
to
make
the
most
sense
and
the
one
that
came
closer
to
the
heart
and
core
of
this
whole
matter
was
one
in
michigan
in
1888
by
district
court
judge
in
the
case
of
vernan
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
opinions
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
i
may
just
read
that,
it
explains
so
exactly
what
my
thought
was.
he
said,
“i
see
no
reason
why
he”
referring
to
the
litigant,
“might
not
procure
the
attendance
of
an
important
witness
from
california
or
even
australia
or
other
remote
quarter
of
the
globe
and
practically
ruin
the
opposite
party
by
the
accumulation
of
costs”.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
that
particular
court
adhered
to
the
100-mile
limitation.
but
i
must
say
that
none
of
these
cases
follow
any
routine
or
any
pattern
except
the
latter
of
the
cases
which
have
fallen
into
a
pattern.
and
each
of
the
cases
which
might
be
considered
to
have
formulated
the
rule,
all
appear
to
me
to
have
been
decided
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
it
depended
on
the
equities
of
the
particular
situation,
and
it
was
in
that
fashion
that
the
rule
evolved.
and
i
have
made
no
effort
in
our
brief
to
improve
upon
the
reasons
given
in
the
dissenting
opinions
below
as
to
the
justifications
of
the
rule.
first,
it
would
be
presumptuous
and
it
would
be
supererogation
and
frankly,
i
myself
see
no
logic
in
the
rule.
and
to
me
it's
more
important
that
there
is
such
rule
than
to
find
a
reason
for
it
any
more
than
i
would
find
a
reason
for
the
100-mile
limitation
prescribed
by
this
court
in
admiralty.
now
the
point
that
i
come
to
now
deals
with
the
requirement
that
in
exercising
his
discretion
under
the
rule
as
to
whether
to
grant
or
withhold
cost,
a
judge
is
bound
to
take
into
consideration
the
views
expressed
by
another
judge.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
very
nature
of
a
discretion
conferred
upon
a
judge,
it's
an
impossibility
to
say
to
a
judge,
“you
may
exercise
your
discretion
provided
you
give
weight
to
views
expressed
by
other
judges”.
discretion
isn't
given
by
withholding
it
at
the
time
that
you're
given
it.
secondly,
the
reason
that
was
given
seemed
to
me
not
to
be
a
very
valid
reason
and
the
court
said
with
great
concern
for
the
sensitivity
of
the
judge
affected
and
for
his
views
that
they
thought
that
it
was
not
altogether
proper
to
affront
a
judge
by
disregarding
his
views
and
having
another
judge
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
by
the
time
a
judge
has
ascended
the
bench,
he
has
become
pretty
well
accustomed
to
contrariety
of
opinion.
if
he
hasn't,
by
virtue
of
his
practice
and
by
virtue
of
his
encounter
with
his
adversaries
in
the
courts,
he
has
in
many,
many
ways.
and
once
he
ascends
the
bench,
he
encounters
contrariety
of
opinion
from
at
least
50%
of
the
lawyers
who
appear
before
him.
true,
he
has
the
ascendancy
but
every
time
appellate
court
speaks,
he
is
subjected
to
the
trauma
of
contrariety
of
opinion.
and
if
he
happens
to
be
a
married
man,
and
is
fortunate
in
having
teenage
children,
he
encounters
it
at
home
every
day
of
his
life.
and
if
i
may
borrow
an
expression
of
samuel
johnson's
in
his
essay
on
hope,
and
he
said
concerning
addison
if
contrariety
could
poison
a
politician,
he
would
not
live
a
single
day.
and
so
i
say
if
contrariety
could
poison
a
judge,
he
would
not
live
a
single
day.
so
to
say
that
a
judge
may
not
exercise
the
discretion
conferred
upon
him
by
law
for
fear
of
giving
offense
to
another
judge
who
is
previously
expressed
an
opinion
just
--
it
doesn't
conform
to
the
realities
of
the
situation
and
offers
no
justification
for
the
denial
of
justice
to
the
litigant
who
may
be
affected.
and
more
important
than
that,
the
second
judge
in
this
particular
case
had
the
advantage
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
or
withhold
costs
of
having
an
expression
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
manner
of
trying
this
case
in
various
other
factors.
and
the
discretion
conferred
by
the
statute
should
be
given
as
the
situation
stands
right
up
to
the
moment
of
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
should
not
permit
the
dead
hand
of
some
prior
determination
made
under
other
circumstances
to
control
his
conscience.
so,
i
say
that
the
rule
isn't
a
good
one.
it
could
lead
only
to
confusion.
and
in
this
particular
case
it
shows
the
extent
to
which
it
can
confuse
when
the
court
of
appeals
while
holding
that
the
second
trial
judge
was
bound
to
follow
the
first
trial
judge,
held
at
the
same
time
that
a
good
portion
of
the
first
trial
judge's
determination
was
erroneous
and
it
reversed
that
portion
of
it.
so,
i
think
your
honors
that
this
is
a
rule
that's
so
important
that
so
vitally
affects
litigants
particularly
those
who
don't
have
great
means
that
clarification
of
the
rule
for
the
guidance
of
all
of
the
circuits
should
be
made.
and
i
believe
it
should
be
made
in
the
manner
proposed
by
the
minority
below.
now,
the
next
point
that
i
come
to
is
the
point
that
we
consider
that
--
i
should
like
just
to
say
about
that
that
the
controverted
points
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
erroneous
was
that
when
application
was
made
for
re-taxation
before
the
first
judge,
we
pointed
out
that
certain
seats
on
the
company
owned
planes
had
been
unoccupied
at
the
same
time
that
these
witnesses
were
brought
in.
and
the
court
suspended
his
decision
as
to
that
portion
of
the
costs
and
asked
for
proof
under
ought
as
to
whether
or
not
first
it
was
company
plane,
secondly
whether
they
were
regularly
run
trips
or
whether
they
will
run
specially
to
accommodate
these
witnesses,
and
whether
they
would've
been
empty
seats
anyway
of
these
--
to
these
persons
had
not
occupied
them.
and
when
the
proof
was
furnished
by
the
defendants
and
it
proved
that
these
were
regularly
scheduled
runs
which
would've
run
regardless
that
if
these
witnesses
had
not
occupied
them,
those
seats
would
have
remained
empty.
to
our
great
surprise
he
nevertheless
made
the
award
and
held
that
because
the
defendants
accounting
procedures
were
perfectly
correct
and
proper
that
he
should
make
the
allowance.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
come
to
and
that
we
consider
the
really
important
point
is
the
amount
of
costs
that
were
taxed
here
and
the
great
danger
that
would
result
to
this
country
and
to
its
citizens
if
some
curb
were
not
put
upon
the
taxing
of
cost.
we
have
said
and
the
defendant
has
not
controverted,
that
if
the
limitation
were
removed
as
proposed
by
the
court
below,
the
costs
would
be
enlarged
to
such
an
amount
as
to
close
the
doors
of
our
courthouse
to
a
large
numbers
of
our
citizens.
that
has
not
been
controverted.
we
have
appended
some
summary
showing
the
earnings
of
the
citizenry
of
this
country
and
there
has
been
no
mention
made
of
this
chart
nor
of
the
conclusion
that
we
draw
from
it
by
the
defendant.
and
they
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
intend
to
argue
the
matter
but
their
briefs
had
not
discussed
the
subject
at
all.
now
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
no
sir.
the
--
in
that
--
no
testimony
was
taken
and
i
'am
not
aware
that
anybody
ever
called
upon
the
defendant
to
state
whether
or
not
they
would
suffice.
the
--
as
judge
clark
pointed
out
in
his
declaring
opinion,
not
withstanding
the
very
pointed
reference
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
second
opinion
as
to
the
--
first
termed
expensive
and
then
expect
--
expansive
way
of
trying
the
case.
the
defendant
heedless
of
that
went
ahead
and
proceeded
again
to
bring
the
witnesses.
now,
it's
not
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
we
weren't
sure
until
shortly
before
the
trial
as
to
who
would
be
brought.
as
to
their
intending
to
tax
them
for
costs,
we
had
no
idea
about
it.
we
had
thought
that
the
costs
would
be
limited
pretty
much
as
they
were
in
the
state
court.
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
examining
the
defendant's
witnesses.
we
deferred
to
the
convenience
of
the
defendant
and
exceeded
to
their
request
for
numerous
adjournments.
one
day,
we
were
told
that
we
could
examine
a
particular
witness
but
that
we
would
have
to
examine
him
that
day
and
conclude
his
examination
that
day
because
he
was
going
back
to
saudi
arabia.
we
had
to
drop
everything
that
we
were
doing
and
sit
down
and
spent
an
entire
day
without
respite.
examined
great
numbers
of
documents
and
that
was
the
end
of
that,
off
they
went.
now,
i
might
say
and
i
know
that
this
is
a
subject
that's
not
appropriate
in
this
court,
i
could
have
had
the
occasion
arisen
demonstrated
that
there
was
no
need
for
many
of
the
witnesses.
the
defendant
staged
what
i
only
could
describe
as
an
extravaganza,
complete
with
pretty
ladies
in
uniform.
and
finally
just
give
one
illustration
of
what
i
mean.
i
will
have
to
refer
again
to
the
facts.
the
defendant
did
not
for
two
years
--
for
approximately
two
years
after
the
commencement
of
trial
assert
a
defense
of
justification
for
this
charge.
it
had
examined
the
plaintiff
at
the
very
outset
of
the
case
and
had
elicited
certain
facts
upon
which
it
later
predicated
its
defense
of
justification,
but
for
two
years
it
never
moved
to
include
that
as
a
defense.
now
what
did
that
defense
consisted?
the
defendant
had
a
rule
at
its
hospital
in
saudi
arabia
that
before
any
surgical
operation,
certain
preoperative
procedures
should
be
followed,
the
taking
of
a
blood
count
and
a
blood
--
and
a
urine
analysis.
now
the
physician
or
the
surgeon
performing
the
surgery
had
no
responsibility
for
the
taking
of
these
preoperative
tests.
that
was
prescribed.
there
was
a
staff
set
up
to
do
it,
they
did
it
as
automatically
as
anything
else
could
be
done.
and
in
the
particular
instant,
i
am
talking
about
these
preoperative
procedures
were
taken
and
the
results
were
negative,
that
is
to
say
they
proved
satisfactory
for
the
operation.
the
doctor
in
his
examination
was
asked
whether
he
had
taken
these
procedures
and
he
said
truthfully
he
had
not.
and
then
thinking
to
justify
the
failure
to
take
them,
his
failure
to
take
them,
he
went
on
to
say
they
were
unnecessary.
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
these
procedures
as
i
said
were
taken
and
proved
negative.
now
the
doctor
had
said
he
had
never
seen
a
written
rule
requiring
such
procedures
and
that
same
statement
was
made
in
the
examination
before
trial
and
at
trial
by
the
doctor's
superior,
the
head
of
the
particular
medical
installation
who
said
he
also
had
never
seen
a
written
rule
to
that
effect.
now
out
of
the
doctor's
statement,
our
client's
statement
that
he
has
never
seen
such
rule,
they
called
medical
experts
to
prove
the
terrible
consequences
that
comes
from
not
following
such
rule.
they
called
the
head
of
a
former
--
of
a
hospital
at
which
the
plaintiff
had
formally
been
employed
to
say
that
while
in
that
hospital
many
years
earlier,
the
plaintiff
had
acknowledged
receipt
of
a
set
of
rules
which
included
such
rule.
well,
the
validity
or
the
usefulness
of
such
a
rule
wasn't
in
controversy
nor
did
we
challenged
the
necessity
for
the
preoperative
procedures
prescribed
and
yet
from
the
witnesses
that
were
called
it
was
made
to
appear
as
if
we
opposed
all
procedures,
we
were
against
them,
that
we
charged
ahead
and
didn't
do
them
and
the
narrow
issue
that
was
in
this
case
was
whether
the
doctor
had
been
orally
informed
of
the
results
of
these
procedures
before
commencing
the
operation.
and
on
that
narrow
issue,
they
justified
the
calling
of
all
manner
of
witnesses
and
i
think
(inaudible)
--
i
think
that
their
necessity
really
was
conjured
up
in
the
minds
of
the
defendant
but
a
rich
and
resourceful
defendant
can
justify
the
necessity
to
most
anything
if
he
thinks
it
will
help
win
the
lawsuit.
i
see
my
time
is
approaching
--
the
end
of
my
time
is
approaching.
i
regret
that
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
conclude
it
but
i
think
that
the
justice
of
the
point
we
make,
namely
that
in
a
country
where
all
of
us
are
subordinate
to
the
laws,
the
executive,
the
judiciary
and
the
administrative
departments,
where
all
our
rights
are
tied
up
in
the
constitution,
where
every
thing
that
we
cherish,
whether
be
person,
liberty
or
property,
depends
upon
the
constitution.
we
can't
depend
upon
the
dead
letter
of
the
constitution
to
ensure
to
our
citizens
those
rights
unless
they're
given
the
means
of
establishing
them
and
enforcing
them
in
a
court
of
law.
and
if
they're
forced
to
buy
a
ticket
of
admission
and
pay
as
they'd
go,
many,
many
citizens
who
can't
afford
to
purchase
the
ticket
or
pay
their
way
would
be
deprived
of
what
they're
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
right
from
the
state
which
has
taken
away
from
each
of
us
the
right
of
self-help
in
aid
of
our
rights
and
has
substituted
the
power
of
the
state
which
we
are
committed
to
extend
to
every
citizen.
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
i
want
to
request
the
chief
justice
if
i
may,
i
think
--
mr.
kalman
i.
nulman
i'll
address
myself
to
the
last
thing
that
mr.
bordeau
said.
the
argument
that
the
poor
are
benefited
by
the
allowance
of
great
--
of
costs
sounds
plausible,
but
in
the
actual
event
it's
illusory
because
it
supposes
first
that
he
has
the
funds
to
advance
during
the
trial,
and
secondly
it
fails
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
the
benefit
to
him
from
the
recoupment
is
disproportionate
to
the
financial
ruin
which
he
faces
if
he
loses.
now
as
to
the
disparity
between
the
rich
and
the
poor,
our
theory
of
law
has
always
been
that
the
individual
fitted
against
the
overwhelming
might
of
the
state
is
entitled
to
certain
equalizing
factors.
and
as
evidence
of
that,
the
first
ten
amendments
of
our
constitution
provides
safeguards
for
the
individual
against
the
might
of
the
state.
now
as
to
the
quotations
that
mr.
bordeau
read,
i'll
stand
on
the
statement
we
made
in
our
brief
about
the
two
answers
as
quoted
at
page
7
of
mr.
bordeau's
brief.
and
finally
as
to
my
statement
that
dr.
bourne
was
dr.
farmer's
chief,
these
questions
as
reflected
in
the
record
were
asked
and
answered
specifically,
“dr.
bourne,
did
you
ever
see
any
written
rule
requiring
preoperative
laboratory
procedures
such
as
the
taking
of
urine
and
blood
specimens
for
analysis?”
“i
do
not
definitely
recall
having
seen
them”.
“you
were
dr.
farmer's
chief,
were
you
not?”
“yes”.
“what
i'm
asking
you
dr.
bourne
is
was
there
any
list
of
rules
containing
among
them
such
a
rule?”
“i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
had
at
some
time
been
written
out.
i
actually
have
never
seen
such
a
written
rule
pertaining
to
it
in
our
hospital”.
