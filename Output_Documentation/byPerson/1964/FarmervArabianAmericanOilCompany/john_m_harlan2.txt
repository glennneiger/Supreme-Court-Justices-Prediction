justice
john

are
you
going
to
address
yourself
at
some
point
to
the
question
of
law
as
to
whether
the
100-mile
rule,
100-mile
limit
on
subpoena
power
should
be
imported
into
the
cost
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
ask
you
this
question?
now,
when
--
all
of
these
cases,
as
i
understand
it,
when
i
followed
the
result,
we
really
got
three
questions
in
front
of
us.
number
one
is
whether
there
is
such
a
limitation
on
the
cost
rule.
and
number
two
is
whether
there
was
an
error
of
law
as
your
opponent
claims
in
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
that
judge
weinfeld
was
bound
to
follow
judge
palmieri's
award
of
cost
on
the
first
trial.
and
number
three
whether
they're
assuming
that
both
those
things
are
actually
in
your
favor,
there
was
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
all
there
is
to
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
anything
more?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
more
than
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'd
like
to
hear
you
for
myself
on
the
question
of
the
subpoena
limitation
being
imported
into
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
courts
--
if
the
courts
did
that,
did
they
do
it
in
terms
of
rules
of
different
guidelines
that
they
