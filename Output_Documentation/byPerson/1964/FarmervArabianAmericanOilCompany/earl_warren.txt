mr.

you
may
continue
you
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
was
the
first
bond
required?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
just
(inaudible)
as
to
why
depositions
would
not
serve
the
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
know
whether
it's
important
here
or
not,
but
did
the
plaintiff
know
that
before
the
first
trial,
that
they
were
bringing
these
witnesses
here
and
intended
to
tax
them
as
cost?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bordeau.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
the
words
used
in
the
same
sets
in
both
instances?
that
would
seem
to
be
the
important
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
he
use
it
in
--
on
page

was
it
you
say
of
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
3
of
his
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
last
part
is
what
bothers
me
in
connection
with
what
you
just
read
from
the
record,
is
what
he
read
--
is
what
you
read
from
the
record
say
that
they're
not
entitled
to
these
costs
because
they're
a
rich
litigant?
didn't
he
on
the
contrary
say
that
a
rich
litigant
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
try
the
case
over
expensively
for
the
purpose
of
loading
the
costs
on
the
defendant
to
an
extent
that
would
prevent
him
from
going
into
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
he
saying
he
never
used
them
in
that
sentence?
now,
isn't
the
use
of
the
words,
what
were
more
important
--
whether
it's
more
important
to
us
and
the
fact
that
whether
that
you
can
find
them
some
place
in
the
record,
you
must
take
them
in
context?
it
seems
to
me
if
they're
justifiable,
i
don't
say
they're
not,
but
i'm
asking
you
the
question
as
to
whether
judge
weinfeld
used
the
term
rich
litigant
in
the
sense
that
you
are
now
presenting
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
that
he
said,
while
this
defendant
as
the
court
of
appeals
observed,
“with
its
rich
resources,
he
may
well
wish
to
try
the
case
expensively”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it,
as
a
successful
litigant
is
entitled
to
tax
costs
only
in
amount
specified
in
applicable
statutes
and
where
not
expressly
specified
the
allowable
costs
must
not
only
be
reasonable
but
necessary
in
resisting
the
plaintiff's
claim.
that's
on
page
54.
now,
is
that
you
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
that
he
denied
them
those
costs
because
they
were
rich
litigant.
he
says
they're
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
entitled
to
over
try
their
case
and
then
assess
the
costs
against
the
plaintiff.
chief
justice

warren
when
was
your

answer

was?

and
then
--
chief

on
the
question
of
this

notice,
i
understood
mr.

to
say
that
the

testified
that

was

no,

just
want

to
speak

could
be

chief

mr.
bordeau,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
just
one
question
about
whether
or
not
judge
weinfeld
was
foreclosed
from
fixing
costs
of
the
first
trial
by
the
order
of
judge
palmieri?
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
state
it
briefly?
we
(voice

--
chief
justice

i'd
like
to
know
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
first
judge
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice

warren
no,
but
it
was
reversed.
chief

warren
yes,
i
think
you
have
one
minute.
chief

very
well.
