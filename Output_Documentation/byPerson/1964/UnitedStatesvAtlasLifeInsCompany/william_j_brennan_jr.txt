justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
let
me
try
to
simplify
it
and
i
hope
i
don't
really
complicate
it.
(inaudilbe)
in
your
picking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
$8
is
needed
for
the
policyholders'
reserve
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
$3
for
the
company.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
actually
what
they
receive
is
$5
in
the
state
bondage
and
$5
in
general
motors.
the
problem
is
something
like
this,
we
have
to
find
$8
for
the
policyholders'
reserve.
now,
to
take
$5
of
the
general
motors
interest,
they're
still
shy
of
$3.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
you
have
to
take
three
of
the
tax
--
of
the
state
bond
interest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
wouldn't
you?
that
would
leave,
if
you
did
it
that
way
allocating
the
whole
$5
at
general
motors
plus
$3,
that
would
still
leave
$2
with
the
company's
interest
in
what
would
be
a
state
bondage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
there
would
be
no
tax
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
if
you'll
allocate
the
$5
of
state
bond
interest
to
the
policyholders
and
then
draw
$3
from
the
general
motors'
interest
to
make
up
to
$8,
then
there'd
be
$2
for
general
motors'
interest
that
would
be
taxed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
i'm
not
quite
sure
off,
the
government's
position
is
that
neither
of
those
solutions
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
government's
position
is
that
the
allocation
should
be
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
then
the
tax
is
on
$1?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
dollar.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
way
the
insurance
company
invest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
unfortunately
the
next
sentence
at
the
very
same
paragraph
suggests
differently.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
won't
take
anymore
of
your
time
in
this
mr.
goldberg
to
--
but
do
you
know
of
any
explicit
holding
you
suggest
in
pollock,
that
has
pollock?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
says
clearly
that
the
federal
government
has
no
constitutional
power
to
tax
state
and
local
bonded
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
goldberg,
did
i
understand
you
at
the
outset
to
suggest
that
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
government
in
this
case
would
have
an
impact
upon
the
market
for
taking
this
to
bonds,
not
this
life
insurance
company,
its
customers
but
other
investors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
why
would
--
why
did
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
present
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
question
that
was
last
asked
to
mr.
goldberg.
if
we
agree
with
you
that
under
this
formulation
as
far
as
103
is
concerned,
there
is
no
tax
on
income.
do
we
then
have
to
reach
a
constitutional
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
if
there
isn't,
that's
the
question.
would
the
answer
yes
then,
we
will
have
to
decide
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute
whether
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
the
constitution?
