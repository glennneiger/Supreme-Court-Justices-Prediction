justice
byron

white
isn't
this
sort
of
the
analysis
from
mr.
justice
stone
in
gehner?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
quite
prevail.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
answer
though,
mr.
solicitor
general,
to
the
national
life
i
suppose
that
if
you
have
$40,000
income
from
taxable
sources,
and
then
you
get
--
then
you
get
the
$20,000
worth
of
tax-free
income,
you
increase
your
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
by
reason
if
they
received
a
tax-exempt
income,
your
tax
bill
is
increased.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
its
--
really
a
difference
in
kind,
not
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
in
this
degree?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
darrell,
i
gather
that
you
think
is
the
“but
for”
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
which
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
national
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
gehner?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
darrell,
is
that
--
could
you
see
any
difference
between
this
proviso
that
was
put
on
in
its
present
form
and
a
proviso
which
would
have
said
if
this
results
in
unconstitutionally
taxing
interest
an
adjustment
shall
be
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
way
you
put
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
you
put
it,
you
said
the
proviso
means
that
if
this
results
in
taxing
--
tax-exempt
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
tax-exempt
interest
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
tax-exempt
by
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
national
life
and
gehner
are
constitutionally
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they're
plan
holdings
that
the
--
the
securities
of
local
governments
are
constitutionally
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
be
in
a
constitutional
discussion
with
national
life?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
just
the
--
because
of
the
1921
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
--
that's
just
because
the
congress
has
said
that
it
should
be
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
see
--
what
--
where
do
you
see
anything
in
national
life
got
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
--
i
understand
what
it
held
but
i
don't
--
i'm
wondering
when
--
what
part
of
the
constitution
it
placed
that
decision
on.
did
it
just
assumed
some
constitutional
exemption
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
even
discussed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
--
that's
a
case
cited
in
the
national
life.
well,
go
ahead.
i
was
just
wondering
whether
this
was
a
--
even
if
the
solicitor
general
were
asking
us
to
overrule
national
life
and
gehner
doesn't
mean
that
exactly
to
make
a
constitutional
decision
unless
those
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
goldberg,
you
--
do
you
still
--
you
would
agree
i
suppose
so
that
you
have
$200,000
(inaudible)
--
if
the
insurance
company
has
$200,000
worth
of
taxable
income.
it
pays
x
dollars
in
tax
and
--
but
then
if
it
has
$200,000
of
an
income
but
$50,000
of
it
is
tax-exempt
income.
it's
going
to
pay
less
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
why
isn't
that
as
meaningful
as
your
“but
for”
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes
but
if
that's
what
they
meant,
if
that's
what
they
--
if
that's
what
a
tax
on
was,
it
is
a
very
peculiar
way
of
writing
the
act
because
the
inevitable
result
was
the
elimination
of
the
allocation
to
the
policyholder's
share
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
however
yours
(inaudible)
--
ever
won't
be
an
adjustment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
need
to
spell
it
out,
meaning,
--
but
you
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
assert
that
at
least
in
some
few
instances,
the
burden
of
this
statute
will
actually
have
some
substance
in
it.
but
in
most
instances,
i
would
think
--
you
would
think
--
he
would
see
if
--
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
adjustment.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
goldberg
just
one
more.
assume
that
the
court
decided
the
--
with
considering
going
with
the
government
on
this
case,
i'm
not
suggesting
anyone
is
about
to
but
assume
they
were
and
were
--
and
we're
say
--
we're
going
to
say
that
under
the
--
under
this
proviso,
this
tax
was
not
on.
it
was
not
on
tax-exempt
interest
under
section
103,
wouldn't
that
automatically
then
have
to
go
on
and
say,
but
is
it
on
tax-exempt
interest
for
purposes
of
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
what
do
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
isn't
--
wouldn't
you
be
forced
to
get
to
the
next
step.
it
may
not
be
on
within
the
--
under
section
103
within
the
terms
of
a
proviso
but
how
about
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
to
--
don't
you
have
to
get
to
the
constitutional
argument
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
congress
i
don't
suppose
could
waive
the
constitutional
immunity
if
there
is
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
i
said
it
could
not
waive
the
constitutional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
immunity
which
the
states
enjoy
if
there
is
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
because
they
said
--
just
because
they
might
have
said,
well,
if
it
isn't
on
for
purposes
of
section
103,
we
hope
it
isn't
on
for
purposes
of
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
a
constitutional
immunity
about
that.
