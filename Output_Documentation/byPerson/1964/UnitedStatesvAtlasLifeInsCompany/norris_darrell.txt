mr.
norris
darrell
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
it
maybe
helpful
at
the
outset
to
indicate
what
we
consider
the
basic
differences
between
the
parties.
petitioner
gives
no
real
substantive
meaning
to
the
exception
clauses,
respondent
does.
petitioner
argues
as
though
the
views
of
the
majority
of
the
court
in
national
life
represented
the
rule
--
governing
rule
of
constitution
law,
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
exception
clauses
and
when
the
leaders
explained
them
to
congress
in
seeking
the
vote.
the
petitioner
says
that
where
a
life
insurance
company
receives
tax-exempt
income,
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
was
intended
to
reduce
its
major
business
expense
deduction
because
it
has
received
some
tax-exempt
interest
and
in
proportion
to
the
amount
received
because
it
is
fair
and
reasonable
to
do
so.
it
says
this
not
withstanding
that
the
expense
would
have
been
incurred
had
the
company
not
received
any
tax-exempt
interest.
the
respondent
on
the
other
hand
says
that
it
was
not
intended
and
would
be
unconstitutional
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
so
to
reduce
a
business
expense
deduction
that
would
have
been
allowed
the
taxpayer
had
he
not
received
the
tax-exempt
interest
that
when
it
finally
faced
up
to
it,
congress
added
the
exception
clauses
because
it
did
not
want
to
burden
states
and
municipal
buying
power
and
because
it
did
not
wish
to
contravene
the
decisions
of
the
this
court
which
--
in
the
light
of
which
as
the
court
below
found
the
exception
clauses
were
added.
the
record
shows
that
without
application
of
the
exception
clauses,
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
a
marginal
--
effective
marginal
rate
of
tax
on
its
tax-exempt
interest
of
29.1%
and
that
with
that
marginal
rate,
taxable
securities
with
higher
interest
rates
would
be
much
more
attractive
under
normal
market
conditions.
now,
i
should
say
parenthetically
that
this
result
would
not
be
true
in
every
case.
study
show
that
an
increase
tax
would
not
result
in
every
case
from
the
statutory
formula
and
on
page
55
of
our
brief
we
give
one
such
illustration.
in
our
brief,
we
review
the
legislative
history
of
the
1959
act
and
its
predecessors
and
show
how
the
treasury
has
persistently
sought
to
persuade
congress
to
test
anew
the
constitutional
immunity
doctrine.
the
story
starts
with
the
21
acts
which
has
then
explained
to
you
allowed
a
4%
deduction
but
reduced
the
deduction
by
the
amount
of
tax-exempt
interest
received.
if
the
computation
of
the
reserves
with
--
as
in
this
case
was
not
affected
by
tax-exempt
interest
and
the
full
4%
would
have
been
deductible
if
the
company
had
not
had
tax-exempt
interest.
now
this
court
in
national
life
held
that
by
so
diminishing
the
4%
deduction,
national
life
was
required
to
pay
an
additional
tax
because
of
the
receipt
of
the
tax-exempt
interest
and
that
this
amounted
to
imposing
a
tax
on
such
interest
contrary
to
general
--
mr.
norris
darrell
that's
what
he
means
for
the
“but
for”.
mr.
norris
darrell
i
cannot
read
that
case
and
the
other
cases
as
coming
out
the
way
of
the
learned
solicitor
general
suggested.
mr.
norris
darrell
yes.
mr.
norris
darrell
yes.
mr.
norris
darrell
in
gehner.
the
story
continues
with
the
9th
--
mr.
norris
darrell
that
is
correct
but
in
the
national
life,
the
court
decided
the
packard
motor
power
company,
a
michigan
supreme
court
case
which
involved
just
such
an
apportionment
and
inside
of
that
case
was
approval.
it
also
cited
national
life
when
it
decided
gehner
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
ready
these
cases
without
thinking
that
the
situation
is
the
same
whether
it
was
a
full
deduction
or
an
apportionment.
mr.
norris
darrell
i
think
i
do.
mr.
norris
darrell
i
think
so.
mr.
norris
darrell
that's
the
way
you
--
the
fact
said.
mr.
norris
darrell
that
is
correct.
now
the
story
continues
with
the
1932
act
which
dropped
the
appending
provision
and
--
but
the
raised
the
reserve
deduction
by
a
quarter
percent
in
order
to
restore
the
tax
basis
the
same
status
as
before.
no
one
at
that
time
suggested
that
they
could
get
around
national
life
by
a
proportionate
deduction
and
for
the
reason
we've
just
discussed
those
cases
were
all
decided
by
that
time.
and
even
slayton
had
been
decided
which
reaffirmed
national
life
and
nobody
thought
then
that
you
could
do
it.
now
this
was
the
situation
in
32
but
the
treasury
didn't
give
up.
ten
years
later
in
1942
though
these
decisions
had
in
no
way
been
modified,
the
treasury
initially
proposed
that
the
reserve
deduction
be
reduced
by
a
proportion
--
the
proportion
that
tax-exempt
interest
or
the
total
income.
this
as
objected
to
is
violating
national
life.
the
treasury
at
the
same
time
proposed
that
congress
take
a
whole
look
at
the
general
statutory
provision
exempting
those
bonds
from
tax,
the
whole
immunity
doctrine.
the
whole
matter
then
was
reviewed
by
both
tax
committees
very
carefully.
both
turned
down
a
proposal.
in
the
1942
act
is
finally
enacted
and
then
all
successive
acts
until
1959,
the
reserve
deduction
were
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
net
investment
income
to
be
computed
by
the
treasury
on
--
for
the
entire
life
insurance
industry.
while
tax-exempt
interest
was
taking
into
account
for
the
treasury
in
computing
its
formula
its
industry
wide
percentage,
an
individual
company's
tax
liability
was
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
it
received
more
or
less
tax-exempt
income.
two
companies
having
the
same
taxable
income
but
with
differing
tax-exempt
income
would
pay
exactly
the
same
tax.
thus
from
1942
to
194
--
57,
no
question
could
arise
as
to
whether
a
tax
is
imposed
on
tax-exempt
interest
from
an
individual
company
standpoint.
the
story
is
brought
up
to
date
with
the
1959
act
which
reverted
to
the
individual
company
basis
by
determining
the
reserve
deduction
and
which
for
the
first
time
taxed
insurance
--
life
insurance
companies
not
solely
on
their
investment
income
but
on
their
total
income
including
gain
from
operations
resulting
from
favorable
experience
with
mortality
and
expense
assumption.
the
house
bill
adopted
the
basic
two
phase
approach
reflected
in
the
act
as
finally
enacted
and
both
phases
contained
the
so-called
“add-back”
clauses
pursuant
to
which
the
reserve
deductions
was
reduced
by
a
proportion
of
the
tax-exempt
interest
received.
the
state
and
local
governments
were
not
alerted
until
the
bill
reached
the
senate.
in
the
senate
finance
committee,
their
representatives
and
several
senators
complained
vigorously
that
the
cost
of
borrowing
would
be
increased.
their
bonds
would
be
less
attractive.
the
“add-back”
provisions
were
unconstitutional
under
national
life
and
gehner.
mr.
lindsey,
assistant
to
the
secretary
was
questioned.
he
admitted
that
the
bill
might
well
result
in
litigation
and
in
the
subsequent
memorandum
suggested
that
subsequent
decisions
cast
out
on
national
life.
but
senatorial
opposition
mounted
and
in
the
hearings
no
committee
member
expressed
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
the
desirability
of
full
exemption
or
the
continuing
validity
of
national
life.
on
the
contrary,
both
were
made
a
basic
objection
to
the
house
bill.
the
senate
committee
then
redrafted
the
bill
to
change
the
reserve
deduction
into
an
exclusion
of
a
so-called
policyholders'
share.
i
personally
doubt
that
at
first
the
effect
of
this
plausible
sounding
change
was
fully
understood
by
all
members
of
the
finance
committee
and
state
and
municipal
representatives
but
be
that
as
it
may,
in
time
fair
words
expressed
that
the
revised
formula
did
not
adequately
take
care
of
the
tax-exemption
problem.
in
the
end
and
without
the
approval
of
the
treasury
when
it
came
to
a
showdown,
the
committee
added
the
exemption
--
exception
clauses.
these
clauses
survived
the
conference
committee
although
i
suspect
the
treasury
may
have
tried
and
may
even
have
expected
to
have
them
(inaudible)
--
eliminated
in
congress.
and
it
was
only
with
the
leaders
firm
on
qualified
insurances
that
it
was
not
intended
to
tax
tax-exempt
interest
and
that
the
exemption
clauses
had
been
added
to
make
certain
that
this
would
--
that
no
tax
would
be
posed
on
tax-exempt
interest
that
congress
enacted
the
bill.
mr.
norris
darrell
i
think
it's
an
entirely
different
thing.
i
do
not
think
congress
intended
to
raise
the
constitutional
question
in
this
court.
i
think
that
--
mr.
norris
darrell
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norris
darrell
yes,
the
proviso
does
say
that
no
--
that
it
could
result
in
imposing
a
tax
on
tax-exempt
interest,
the
interest
that
the
--
mr.
norris
darrell
i
mean
state
and
municipal
bond
interest.
mr.
norris
darrell
well
--
mr.
norris
darrell
well,
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
the
congress
meant
that
they
did
not
want
a
tax
tax-exempt
interest.
i
would
say
further
that
this
is
reinforced
for
the
fact
that
they
knew
of
the
decision
of
this
court.
i
think
also
that
you
must
look
at
this
in
connection
with
section
103
which
is
the
general
exemption
provision
that
covers
the
same
problem
and
that's
what
it
was
tied
in
with.
now,
the
petitioner
seeks
to
counter
this
compelling
legislative
history
of
the
exception
clauses
by
insisting
that
the
tax
effect
of
the
statutory
formula
was
self-evident
and
clear
and
plain
and
understood
to
everyone
and
was
not
intended
to
be
modified
by
the
exception
clauses
except
under
judicial
compulsion.
now
we
think
the
congressional
history
tells
a
contrary
story.
whatever
it
may
have
been
the
understanding
and
desire
of
the
treasury
and
some
members
of
the
committees,
the
fact
is
that
there
was
no
straightforward
disclosure
of
the
crucial
point
on
the
floor
of
either
house
when
the
many
members
of
congress
who
did
not
participate
in
the
committee
hearings
are
called
upon
to
vote.
at
no
point
even
in
response
to
a
specific
question
was
it
ever
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
house
or
the
senate
that
the
effect
of
the
revised
bill
without
the
exception
clauses
would
be
to
increase
a
life
insurance
company's
tax
liability
because
of
its
receipt
of
tax-exempt
interest.
surely
the
distinguished
congressional
leaders
who
presented
the
matter
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
who
are
fully
aware
of
national
life
would
have
been
impelled
to
point
this
out
if
they
have
not
thought
the
exception
clauses
made
it
unnecessary
to
do
so.
it
seems
to
us
that
any
other
conclusion
would
be
inappropriate,
highly
inappropriate.
the
language
of
the
exception
clauses
your
honor
is
clear.
they're
not
limited
in
their
application
to
state
and
municipal
bond
interest.
they
cover
a
certain
federal
interest
and
inner
company
dividends
as
well.
insofar
as
it
covers
state
and
municipal
bond
interest,
they
refer
to
a
tax
on
any
interest
which
under
the
general
exemption
provision
would
be
excluded
from
gross
income.
and
the
only
reasonable
meaning
that
can
be
given
to
these
words,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
insurance
companies
were
intended
to
have
the
same
exemption
as
taxpayers
generally.
this
we
submit
can
only
be
accomplished
by
making
the
adjustments
excluding
such
income
from
gross
income
calculations
as
ordered
by
the
court
below
thus
making
the
receipt
of
tax-exempt
and
come
a
neutral
factor
in
arriving
at
the
tax.
now
passing
for
the
moment
the
exception
clauses,
the
essence
of
petitioner's
case
is
that
no
tax
is
imposed
on
tax-exempt
interest
if
the
statutory
scheme
provides
a
fair
apportionment
of
deductions
between
classes
of
income.
the
question
it
is
said
is
not
whether
the
tax
is
more
but
whether
the
apportionment
is
reasonable
that
the
attempt
to
justify
the
allocation
on
the
ground
of
fairness
it
seems
to
us
must
concede
the
nature
of
the
exemption.
it
is
not
enough
that
an
allocation
be
fair
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
discriminate
against
tax-exempt
income.
if
these
were
the
test
of
immunity,
such
interest
could
always
be
taxed
by
investing
in
tax-exempts,
taxpayers
forego
the
higher
yield
they'd
get
from
taxable
securities
and
the
real
beneficiaries
are
of
course
state
and
municipal
governments.
slayton
and
independent
life
upon
which
the
petitioner
heavily
relies
do
not
support
it
in
our
opinion
neither
was
cited
or
referred
to
by
the
treasury
or
any
congressman
during
the
committee
hearings
or
the
congressional
debates
neither
sustains
a
rule
petitioners
suggest
and
vote
expressly
reaffirm
national
life.
the
expenses
disallowed
in
slayton
were
directly
incurred
in
purchasing
tax-exempts.
it
would
not
have
been
incurred.
they
had
not
bonds
bearing
tax-exempt
interest
being
bought
with
borrowed
money.
it
was
entirely
consistent
with
national
life
to
exclude
from
the
slayton
tax
computation,
the
expense
incurred
in
buying
the
bonds
along
with
the
interest
on
the
bonds.
otherwise,
the
taxpayer
would
gain
an
undue
advantage
by
reducing
the
tax
on
his
taxable
income.
now
assume
two
companies
with
identical
total
assets
arrive
from
identical
sources
with
identical
taxable
income
from
taxable
investments
and
identical
investments
in
tax-exempts
but
with
differing
income
from
tax-exempts
because
one
taxpayer
invested
in
lower
quality
tax-exempts
producing
higher
income.
under
the
1959
act,
the
income
tax
liability
of
the
two
companies
will
not
be
the
same.
income
from
tax-exempt
security
it
itself
--
in
itself
accounts
for
the
difference.
slayton
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
said
situation.
here,
the
petitioner
proposes
a
much
broader
rule
than
slayton.
deductions
would
be
denied
for
any
expense
to
which
the
income
from
tax-exempts
is
allocated
or
apportioned
even
though
the
expense
would
have
been
incurred
in
any
event
and
would
have
been
deductible
if
no
tax-exempt
interest
had
been
received.
the
annual
increase
in
the
life
insurance
companies
reserve
liabilities
is
no
more
a
cost
of
earning
tax-exempt
income
than
as
any
business
expense
of
any
taxpayer
having
tax-exempt
income.
it
occurs
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
company's
income
or
its
amount.
to
disallow
a
deduction
for
such
an
expense
because
of
the
result
of
the
receipt
of
tax-exempt
income
would
be
a
radical
departure
from
--
to
the
policy
the
exemption
long
followed
by
congress
and
committed
by
the
courts.
the
real
meaning
as
the
exemption
would
be
lost
for
the
economic
effect
of
the
denial
of
deductions
are
the
same
as
including
exempt
income
and
gross
income.
insurance
companies
do
not
sell
--
go
out
and
sell
policies
in
order
to
get
money
to
buy
tax-exempts
as
petitioner
suggest.
on
the
contrary,
they
face
investment
decisions
as
do
others
only
after
they
have
the
funds
to
suggest.
now
this
court's
discussion
in
19th
--
1959
case
of
s.c.c.
against
variable
annuity
life
insurance
company
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
seems
to
us
to
rebut
the
thought
that
reserve
increases
our
marginal
cost
of
a
company's
investment.
the
concept
of
insurance
said
the
court
involves
investment
risk
taking
with
his
present
and
policyholders
are
guaranteed
payments
in
fixed
amounts.
it
is
this
investment
risk
taking
not
the
company's
decision
as
to
investment
policy
that
is
represented
by
the
reserve
increases.
petitioner's
argument
would
be
applicable
to
every
taxpayer
whose
income
is
derived
from
business
activity
and
its
logic
could
easily
be
applied
to
reduce
deduction
--
deductions
otherwise
allowable
for
money
spent,
stolen
or
given
to
charter
--
charity
by
every
taxpayer
receiving
tax-exempt
income.
it
disregards
the
view
plainly
inherent
in
the
governing
decisions
to
which
we
have
referred
that
tax-exempt
income
should
be
ignored
for
the
purpose
of
the
exemption.
in
the
present
case,
the
company's
reserve
deduction
is
actually
--
that
is
the
policyholders'
shares
actually
reduced
by
the
--
is
actually
reduced
by
this
opinion.
as
for
independent
life
far
from
limiting
national
life,
this
court
there
recognized
that
the
problem
is
different.
independent
life
was
taxable
only
on
its
investment
income
and
only
investment
expenses
determined
under
a
statute
were
deductible.
its
attempt
to
reduce
its
tax
on
net
investment
income
by
enlarging
its
deductions
to
include
items
directly
attributable
to
the
portion
of
the
billing
occupied
by
itself
and
therefore
not
producing
taxable
income
can
actually
fail.
the
question
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
was
not
involved.
the
same
maybe
said
of
the
petitioner's
example
of
the
allocation
of
automobile
expenses
between
personal
and
business
use.
this
again
is
only
a
matter
of
identifying
expenses
directly
attributable
to
different
uses.
petitioner's
failure
to
recognize
a
difference
between
this
and
the
denial
of
deductions
for
business
expenses
that
are
relatively
fixed
and
are
denied
only
because
of
the
receipt
of
tax-exempt
interest
which
is
not
really
allocation
at
all
is
a
fundamental
defect
in
its
argument.
it's
a
tended
analogy
to
the
taxation,
their
trust
is
no
closer.
life
insurance
companies
are
not
conduits.
their
reserves
reflect
liability
under
contracts
that
are
claims
against
its
entire
assets
like
corporations
generally.
they
are
separate
taxpaying
units
and
not
trust
anything
in
the
advertising
man,
sales,
literature
for
the
contrary
not
withstanding.
in
its
reply
brief
and
again
in
argument,
petitioner
presses
its
view
that
on
the
issue
here
involved,
the
1942
act
was
very
much
like
the
1959
act.
petitioner
does
not
deny
that
from
1942
to
1958,
an
individual
company's
tax
liability
was
not
affected
by
the
amount
of
tax-exempt
interest
it
received.
under
the
1942
act,
the
reserve
deduction
against
taxable
income
never
changed
whereas
under
the
1959
act,
the
deduction
was
lowered
by
the
receipt
of
tax-exempt
interest.
but
it
says
that
because
the
tax
on
taxable
income
in
those
years
was
much
lower
than
under
the
1959
act,
the
tax-exempt
feature
of
tax-exempt
bonds
was
not
then
worth
as
much
as
it
was
under
the
1959
act
when
the
tax
on
--
taxable
income
is
greater.
in
other
words,
it
is
quite
alright
to
impose
a
tax
on
tax-exempt
interest
if
the
tax
imposed
on
taxable
income
is
efficiently
greater
than
under
prior
law
so
as
to
make
tax-exempts
more
attractive.
the
resulting
difference
in
the
attractiveness
of
course
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutory
exemption
or
constitutional
prohibitions
but
apart
from
this,
study
show
that
the
more
likely
explanation
of
changes
in
life
insurance
company
investments
and
tax-exempts
during
the
period
is
a
substantial
increase
in
yield
in
tax-exempts
from
304%
to
352%
that
occurred
during
the
five
years
following
enactment
of
the
1959
act.
the
factor
petitioner
had
--
did
not
know
--
did
not
mention.
petitioner
faced
with
the
exception
clauses
is
hard
pressed
to
explain
them
away.
its
attempt
to
avoid
the
impact
by
the
semantic
argument
focusing
on
the
words
tax
on
deprives
the
clauses
of
any
substance
and
applies
in
the
face
not
only
of
the
congressional
intent
to
meet
the
complaints
of
state
and
municipal
governments
but
what
this
court
said
in
national
life
was
tax
on
exempt
interest.
in
an
effort
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
exception
clauses,
petitioner,
we
submit
runs
into
other
inconsistencies
that
disclosed
its
real
objective.
they
were
intended
--
it
is
said
to
prevent
litigation
on
the
question
whether
tax-exempt
income
maybe
constitutionally
taxed,
yet
they
applied
as
added
only
if
it
is
first
found
that
the
formula
violate
and
assumed
constitutional
prohibition,
a
determination
that
would
raise
the
very
constitutional
question
congress
intended
to
avoid.
again,
stating
it
differently,
petitioner
says,
the
function
of
the
exception
clauses
is
to
provide
adjustments
only
if
the
statutory
formulae
cannot
be
applied
consistently
with
the
established
constitutional
immunity.
yet
in
effect
it
argues
that
the
doctrine
established
by
this
court
in
the
case
to
which
i
have
referred
should
be
disestablished
and
the
new
one
substituted
more
in
line
with
the
dissents
in
national
life.
thus
according
to
petitioner
in
legislating
with
a
view
toward
the
established
doctrine
in
this
area,
congress
meant
not
the
existing
doctrine
established
by
these
unreversed
decisions
but
a
living,
growing
body
of
principles
that
might
hopefully
be
developed
in
some
sets
of
litigations
as
this.
this
attempt
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
the
exception
clauses
when
given
their
plain
and
normal
meaning
should
we
submit
be
rejected.
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
policy,
this
court
does
not
consider
constitutional
questions
where
they
may
be
avoided.
this
policy
is
particularly
fitting
where
the
constitutional
area
involved
is
a
sensitive
area
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
it
is
all
more
fitting
where
the
statutory
interpretation
sought
would
narrow
the
tradition
immunity
and
raise
a
constitutional
question
that
has
not
been
fully
canvassed
by
the
lower
courts
and
where
the
economic
and
other
effects
of
such
action
are
not
developed
by
the
record.
this
court
currently
has
constitutional
burdens
enough
without
becoming
unnecessary
involved
in
this
delicate
one.
the
exception
clauses
we
believe
should
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
doctrine
prevailing
at
the
time
of
their
enactment.
this
rule
was
followed
by
the
second
circuit
in
shamberg's
estate
and
white's
estate
relating
to
port
of
new
york
authority
and
triborough
bridge
authority
bonds
and
the
statute
there
so
interpreted
i
note
has
not
been
modified.
helvering
against
griffiths,
the
stock
dividend
case
is
to
the
same
effect
and
dictates
we
think
that
national
life
should
not
be
reconsidered
here.
we
think
griffiths
is
very
much
closer
to
this
case
and
petitioner
admits
and
for
reasons
more
fully
developed
in
our
brief
should
be
controlling.
in
conclusion,
we
believe
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
the
exception
clauses
is
clear.
but
apart
from
this,
we
respectfully
submit
that
congress
has
not
indicated
certainly,
not
clearly
and
unequivocally,
a
desire
to
impair
the
full
tax-exemption
that
this
court
has
said
in
the
cases
to
which
i
have
referred
was
constitutionally
guaranteed.
that
congress
has
not
created
a
situation
compelling
this
court
to
reconsider
the
validity
of
the
doctrine
it
announced
in
those
cases.and
that
in
keeping
with
the
established
principles
of
--
concerning
the
judicial
approach
to
constitutional
questions
strikingly
reflected
in
griffiths.
this
court
should
refrain
from
reconsideration
of
the
constitutional
question
and
should
unhesitatingly
enforce
as
the
court
below
consistently
with
national
life,
the
congressional
mandate
contained
in
the
exception
clauses.
in
mandate,
congress
can
easily
remove
if
it
wishes.
thank
you.
