justice
tom
c.
clark
go
over
to
page
19
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
he
says
the
whole
predicate
in
his
brief
is
that
no
tax
maybe
constitutional
laid
on
income
from
state
bonds.
so
that
by
saying
that,
the
assumption
on
which
he
argues
is
this
to
accept
the
concept
that
no
tax
may
be
constitutional
laid
on
income
from
state
bond
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
is
that
correct?
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
that
constitutional
issue
is
not
important.
