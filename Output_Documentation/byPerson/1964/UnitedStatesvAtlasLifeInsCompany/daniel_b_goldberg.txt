mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
may
it
please
the
court.
my
appearance
is
on
behalf
of
the
states
and
the
local
governments
which
issue
the
bonds
whose
interest
petitioner
seeks
to
tax.
from
the
solicitor
general's
argument
would
be
almost
hard
to
deduce
that
this
is
basically
a
question
of
the
relationships
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
rather
than
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
life
insurance
companies.
only
from
the
short
range
view
is
this
is
a
controversy
between
united
states
and
life
insurance
companies.
we,
of
the
state
and
local
governments
appear
on
the
side
of
respondents
prior
to
any
identification
of
the
life
insurance
company
industry
but
because
the
burden
of
any
tax
on
our
bond
issues
must
ultimately
fall
on
state
and
local
governments.
we
have
the
greatest
stake
in
this
review.
the
benefits
of
the
exemption
involved
here
can
be
procured
to
its
true
beneficiaries,
the
issuing
governments
only
by
being
translated
into
lower
interest
rates
accepted
by
the
investors.
for
us
to
receive
the
full
measure
of
this
benefit,
the
investors
have
to
know
that
when
they
invest
in
our
bonds
and
pay
for
the
exempt
--
the
exemption
by
accepting
these
lower
rates,
the
interest
they
receive
is
not
going
to
cause
them
tax
dollars.
now
there's
only
one
significant
fact
in
this
litigation
and
it
is
undisputed.
without
the
adjustment
authorized
by
the
exception
provisions,
the
basic
formula
can
in
some
cases
like
the
present
one
but
not
in
all
cases,
impose
a
tax
on
the
investor
on
our
state
municipal
obligation
solely
as
a
result
if
its
receiving
interest
on
them.
that
is
undisputed.
and
the
basic
question
on
this
review
is
whether
the
exception
provisions
shall
be
construed
to
be
inoperative,
the
solicitor
general's
word
in
his
brief,
inoperative
or
to
authorize
the
adjustment
of
which
they
speak,
to
avoid
any
tax
increase
which
results
solely
from
the
receipt
of
state
and
local
bond
interest,
a
result
which
has
never
before
existed
in
our
law
for
an
investor
of
any
class
including
life
insurance
companies
under
the
1942
act.
there
are
many
ways
to
test
the
true
meaning
of
the
exceptions.
i
will
limit
myself
to
just
three
tests
selected
by
the
petitioner
because
i
feel
that
they
require
the
tenth
circuit
result
rather
than
the
result
with
the
petitioner
itself
to
rise
from
its
own
tests
and
there
are
tests
that
you
think
are
most
appropriate
to
represent
in
the
state
and
local
governments
to
apply.
first,
petitioner
says
at
page
15
of
its
brief
that
“the
function
of
the
exception
clauses
was
to
reassure
those
who
were
anxious
to
maintain
the
established
immunity
of
state
bonds
and
to
prevent
the
defense
of
the
statute
which
would
cast
that
immunity
invalid”.
fine,
since
we
give
the
state
and
local
governments
were
foremost
among
those
holding
that
anxiety
and
seeking
that
reassurance
from
congress,
it
becomes
significant
to
determine
exactly
what
we
were
seeking
and
why.
from
the
legislative
history,
it
is
inescapable
that
the
solicitor
general
states
only
a
part
of
what
we
were
seeking
when
he
says
that
we
sought
to
prevent
an
attack
on
our
basic
immunity.
most
of
what
we
were
seeking
was
reassurance
to
avoid
the
additional
tax
which
receipted
just
on
our
bonds
could
produce
under
both
the
house
bill
and
the
unadjusted
senate
formula.
why
we
sought
that
result
is
clear.it
was
the
only
way
we
could
protect
the
market
for
our
bonds.
by
petitioner's
own
test
of
this
function
of
the
exceptions,
its
construction
fails
miserably.
i
can't
state
it
too
broadly.
the
petitioner's
construction
only
fails
to
reassure
us,
it
increases
our
anxiety.
it
threatens
us.
it
was
extended
to
banks
and
other
investors
within
emasculation
and
truncation
of
our
traditional
immunity
and
exemption
which
could
devastate
the
market
for
our
bonds.
i
hope
that
is
not
a
constitutional
argument
although
the
solicitor
general's
brief
begins
with
33
pages
of
constitutional
argument.
this
is
the
argument
we
make
at
--
to
congress.
point
one,
a
33-point
brief.
point
one
of
the
government's
brief
as
a
constitutional
argument.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
make
these
statements
to
you.
i
should
have
prefaced
it
by
saying,
this
is
what
we
told
the
senate
and
that's
why
it's
significant.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
no
he
is
making
a
constitutional
argument
as
to
the
validity
of
the
peroration
attack
or
effect.
he
assumed
the
--
i
think
the
word
assumed
in
his
caption
is
assuming
that
there
is
any
immunity
whatsoever
but
he
is
out
and
has
made
a
vigorous
constitutional
argument
that
the
formula
without
the
adjustments
is
constitutional.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
he
uses
the
phrase
that
you
should
decide,
the
meaning
of
exceptions
by
determining
what
the
living,
growing
body
of
law
is
following
trends.
i
think
that
he
does
ask
you
to
overrule.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
i
think
he
is
asking
you
to
substitute
the
minority
views
and
national
life
and
gehner
for
the
majority
views
which
i
think
congress
enacted.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
he
has
distinctions
but
i
think
he
is
happy
with
the
minority
views
in
those
cases.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
i
didn't
get
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
the
entire
first
point
is
a
constitutional
defense
of
the
formula
without
adjustment.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
oh
yes.
they
certainly
are.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
well,
national
life
dealt
with
local
securities.
gehner
dealt
with
federal
securities
but
on
the
authority
of
national
life
so
they
do
stand
for
the
exemption
of
--
in
the
case
of
national
life,
the
interest
on
state
and
local
government
bond
interest.
and
by
extension
in
the
gehner
case
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
the
national
--
i
don't
have
the
opinion
in
front
of
me
but
the
national
life
case
did
involve
the
constitutionality
of
the
formula
in
the
1921
life
insurance
company
tax
act
which
definitely
had
if
not
been
displaced
by
the
court
on
constitutional
grounds
would
have
reduced
--
would
have
increased
the
tax
as
a
result
of
the
state
and
local
--
receipt
of
state
and
local
bond.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
the
court
struck
down
that
part
of
the
1921
statute.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
no,
the
congress
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
a
--
national
life
decision
--
in
the
national
life
decision,
this
court
disallowed
or
rejected
as
unconstitutional,
a
limitation,
a
deduction
of
the
reserve
increase
deduction
--
business
deduction
of
doing
the
business
of
life
insurance.
congress
provided
that
the
deduction
should
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
i
have--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
it
is
based
upon
the
constitutional
decision
of
this
court
in
the
pollock
case
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
--
which
is
the
case
that
first
established
the
constitutional
immunity
of
state
and
local
government
bond
interest.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
oh,
pollock.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
pollock
said
it
squarely
and
in
the
very
first
revenue
act,
it
was
enacted,
“not
to
arouse
the
antagonism
of
the
states.”
congressman
cordell
hall
in
1913
in
introducing
the
bill
to
establish
the
first
revenue
act
and
since
congress
has
kept
that
exemption
ever
since,
there's
never
been
another
occasion
except
in
dicta
for
this
court
to
retrieve
--
to
refer
to
the
issue
again.
many
dicta
all
conforming
and
following
the
pollock
rule.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that
we
--
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
we
agree
on
that.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
now
our
interest
rates
can
be
forced
up
and
our
duty
to
finance
our
local
improvements
can
be
as
effectively
destroyed
by
the
tax
which
petitioner
seeks
by
no
matter
what
name
such
a
tax
is
called.
the
damage
is
just
as
severe
if
it
is
said
that
the
tax
merely
results
from
the
receipt
of
our
bond
interest
as
if
it
is
said
and
i
think
in
one
normal
colloquial
fashion
but
the
tax
is
on
the
interest.
semantic
differences
don't
interest
the
investors.
now
solicitor
general
stressed
reality,
he
invoked
the
principle
of
reality
in
saying
no
life
insurance
company
is
going
to
keep
idle
cash
unnecessarily.
i
wish
he
would
apply
the
principle
of
reality
on
the
impact
of
the
tax
he
is
seeking
instead
of
using
a
semantic
quibble
between
the
word
on
and
the
word
resulting
from.
we
want
the
principle
of
reality
in
this
case.
and
all
these
as
i
said,
we
told
the
senate
and
protest
against
the
house
bill.
now
the
second
test
that
i
would
like
to
apply
is
that
if
approach
the
question
from
the
point
of
view
or
the
background
of
congressional
purpose,
we
come
out
with
the
same
result.
according
to
the
petitioner,
congress
was
seeking
to
avoid
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
traditional
established
immunity.
and
by
that,
he
means
pollock
alone,
granted.
but
you
can't
stop
there
if
you
want
to
know
how
far
congress
went
in
foreclosing
constitutional
controversy
in
this
sensitive
field
in
federal
state
relations.
according
to
the
petitioner,
congress
went
only
so
far
as
to
prevent
the
constitutional
reexamination
of
the
naked
existence
of
the
immunity
rule
but
not
far
enough
to
foreclose
a
reexamination
seeking
to
narrow
its
scope
which
is
i
think
the
gravamen
of
the
first
point
of
the
petition
in
this
brief.
according
to
the
tenth
circuit,
congress
sought
to
avoid
any
and
all
constitutional
questions
existence
in
(inaudible).
now
to
choose
between
these
views,
we
think
it's
necessary
to
ask
why
congress
insisted
on
heading
off
a
suspected
treasury
attack
on
the
established
state
exemption
immunity
of
being
--
can
say
to
the
congress
suspect
that
such
a
tax
can
attack
and
wanted
to
avoid
it.
now
we
submit
that
the
answer
is
found
in
the
history
of
the
running
debate
in
congress
for
decades
now
between
the
treasury
proponents
of
taxation
in
this
field
and
the
state
and
local
government
defenders
of
the
exemption.
volumes
of
testimony
on
both
sides
were
submitted
in
1938
to
1940
and
1942,
1951
to
the
congressional
committees
and
reports
were
issued
and
debates
were
had
and
votes
were
taken
on
the
committees
and
on
the
floor
of
congress.
i
remember
almost
vividly
having
work
on
this
issue
this
past
27
years.
always
the
treasury
was
defeated.
always
the
exemption
was
retained
in
the
revenue
act
in
the
basic
form
it
took
in
the
first
act
when
congressman
cordell
hall
as
i
said
before
--
mentioned
that
it
was
inserted
to
avoid
arousing
the
antagonism
of
the
states.
always
without
exception,
the
individual
investor
was
assured
that
he
could
buy
state
and
local
government
obligations
tax
free
with
no
tax
increase
resulting
from
the
interest
receipt.
now
the
history
of
this
debates
shows
that
congress
was
only
partly
motivated
by
respect
to
constitutional
proprieties
and
i
think
that
bears
on
some
other
questions
i
had
as
to
the
nature
of
the
national
life
decision.
i
don't
think
it
is
significant
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
stand
on
the
floor
on
whether
national
life
was
or
was
not
a
constitutional
decision.
in
all
these
cases,
congress
is
responding
not
merely
to
constitutional
suggestions
from
state
and
local
government
defenders
of
their
exemption
but
from
their
insistence
upon
the
importance
to
their
market
of
preserving
this
exemption.
the
treasury
was
always
arguing
a
loss
of
federal
tax
revenues
and
alleging
that
investors
received
an
unfair
advantage.
we
for
our
part
have
always
discounted
these
alleged
defects
but
more
important,
we
have
stressed
the
adverse
results
on
our
state
in
this
profound
market.
we
stressed
entries
--
an
increased
interest
cost.
we
stressed
the
total
destruction
of
the
ability
to
borrow
in
some
cases,
an
impairment
of
the
ability
in
all
cases
and
we
always
stress
the
importance
of
the
exemption
to
underpin
sound
local
finances
which
are
essential
to
the
preservation
of
state
and
local
government
in
their
proper
sphere
in
this
federal
system
of
ours.
in
short,
congress
was
always
concerned
with
these
practical
results,
reality
as
the
solicitor
general
said
was
the
guiding
principle.
why
now
should
it
suddenly
have
changed
its
purpose
and
be
satisfied
with
labels,
with
semantics
instead
of
results.
doesn't
such
a
reversal
or
form
needs
some
evidence
in
the
legislative
history?
doesn't
it
require
at
a
minimum
at
least
one
unequivocal
statement
in
the
record
after
the
exceptions
were
agreed
to
that
congress
intended
by
this
act
that
receipt
of
state
and
local
government
bond
that
it
should
increase
the
taxes
paid
by
the
investor?
and
what
do
we
find,
exactly
the
contrary.
what
could
be
more
revealing
of
the
congressional
purpose
in
the
colloquy
on
the
senate
floor
reported
on
page
45
of
our
brief.
i
won't
take
time
to
read
it
your
honors
may
care
to
glance
at
it.

committee

who
will
try
to
find
out
the

of

if
there
was
any
purpose
to
produce
the
result
of
increased
taxes
which
is
admitted,
pressed
by
the
petitioner
now,
wouldn't

byrd
had
been
duty
bound
to
say
so
when
he
was
asked
point
blank
whether
the

when
the
finance
committee
chairman
identified
the
exceptions
in
that
colloquy
as
assuring
continued
exemption
and
accepted
thanks
for
his
efforts
and
holding
on
to
them
in
conference
with
the
house.
how
can
we
impute
to
any
member
of
congress
a
hoax
which
would
have
been
perpetuated
if
there
was
to
be
a
tax
but
one
secretly
rationalized
as
not
being
on
the
interest
but
neither
result
that
its
receipt?
the
only
so-called
evidence
which
petitioner
elicits
is
the
alleged
internal
contradiction
between
the
basic
formula
and
the
statutory
exceptions.
petitioner
calls
it
schizophrenia,
the
solicitor
general's
word,
page
59
of
his
brief.
he
says,
he
calls
it
schizophrenia
for
congress
to
have
both
enacted
a
taxing
formula
and
enacted
an
exemption
to
undo
its
result
in
some
but
not
all
cases.
to
us,
this
is
normal
behavior
and
the
form
shows
a
rule
and
then
exceptions
was
particularly
acted
to
enhance
the
chance
of
concurrence
by
the
house
which
had
started
with
a
different
view
point.
this
is
the
way
things
work
when
you
have
two
houses
of
congress
trying
to
get
together
and
one
starts
off
one
way
and
the
other
wants
to
make
a
change.
but
we
would
apply
the
label
of
schizophrenia
to
a
congress
which
set
out
in
a
single
legislative
subsection
to
show
its
deep
concern
for
state
and
local
governments
by
preventing
a
constitutional
reexamine
of
their
--
reexamination
of
their
basic
immunity
doctrine
as
set
out
in
the
pollock
case.
at
the
same
time
proposed
to
damage
them
severely
by
deliberately
(inaudible)
--
provoking
a
constitutional
challenge
to
erode
the
traditional
scope
of
the
self
same
rule.
we
will
not
impel
such
self
contradiction
and
irrationality
to
congress.
nor
can
we
accept
petitioner's
claim
that
it
is
unthinkable
that
congress
had
its
own
standard
of
what
it
takes
to
authorize
a
taxpayer
to
make
the
adjustment
under
the
exceptions
to
avoid
the
tax
result
prohibited.
petitioner
claims
congress
intended,
“some
superior
external
standard
with
which
the
courts
were
more
familiar
than
the
congress”,
page
56.
in
other
words,
the
petitioner
concludes
that
congress
delegated
to
the
courts
the
completion
of
the
legislative
process.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
no
comment.
such
a
view
comes
suspiciously
close
to
offending
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
it
certainly
contradicts
the
court's
view
of
the
respective
functions
of
congress
in
the
judiciary
as
exemplified
in
the
sinclair
case
which
is
cited
on
page
52
of
our
brief.
now
the
third
test
that
i
would
like
to
apply
is
the
test
--
and
we
welcome
this
test.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
says
that
the
ultimate
test
is
that
the
exceptions
were
designed
to
preserve
the
traditional,
his
word,
and
established,
his
word,
exemption
and
immunity
and
no
more.
search
every
revenue
act
and
every
life
insurance
company
income
tax
act
and
you
will
find
that
never
has
any
investor
traditionally
been
required
to
pay
an
increase
tax
solely
by
reason
of
receiving
state
and
local
bond
interest.
the
only
time
it
could
have
happened
was
under
that
1921
act
which
this
court
struck
down.
but
read
without
that
provision
which
the
court
struck
down,
never
has
any
taxpayer,
life
insurance
company
or
otherwise
ever
been
required
to
pay
increased
taxes
by
reason
to
receive
a
state
and
local
government
bonds
and
that's
the
effects
sought
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
it's
going
to
pay
less
tax.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
my
“but
for”
test
is
the
test
that
congress
adopted
in
response
to
the
demonstrations
--
these
very
demonstrations
that
you
--
that
you're
mentioning
your
honor.
this
whole
mechanical
process
was
added
in
our
protest
to
the
senate.
the
formula
that
the
senate
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
it
doesn't
always
work
that
way.
there
are
instances
in
which
there
will
be
an
adjustment
and
instances
which
there
won't
be
an
adjustment.
under
our
interpretation
--
under
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation,
there
will
never
be
an
adjustment.
and
yet
the
language
also
calls
for
adjustment
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
oh,
there
will
--
there
were
--
there
are
situations
in
which
there
won't
be
an
adjustment.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
concentrated
on
the
game
for
operation
section,
phase
two
of
the
act.
the
phase
two
portion
will
produce
i
think
according
to
the
senate
finance
committee
is
asking
that
something
like
8%
of
the
total
revenue.
most
of
the
money
is
going
to
come
from
phase
one.
most
of
the
money
has
come
from
phase
one.and
in
the
complex
formula,
it
isn't
an
easy
one,
there
is
--
there
are
--
there's
a
so-called
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
there
are
instances.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
it
would
depend
on
the
way
the
municipal
bond
market
was
going.
if
the
life
insurance
companies
were
reducing
their
holdings
during
a
particular
period,
rates
going
down,
corporate
rates
returns
going
up,
it
wouldn't
work
that
way.
during
a
period
of
time
when
over
the
five-year
period,
there
was
an
increase
in
the
receipt
of
state
and
municipal
bond
interest,
you
would
have
an
adjustment
practically
in
all
those
cases.
it
would
depend
on
many
things.
i
hope
that
the
adjustments
would
be
made
because
i
would
hope
that
as
a
result
of
a
victory
in
this
case,
we
can
look
to
increased
investment
state
and
local
government
bonds
by
the
life
insurance
company
industry
which
has
never
been
a
great
holder
to
date
of
our
bonds.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
the
logic
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument
of
saying
that
where
you
don't
have
a
specific
authentication
as
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
there
was
where
you
don't
have
a
specific
identification
of
the
interest
received
and
of
course,
of
the
interest
paid.
you
nevertheless
can
take
the
totality
of
the
business
and
attribute
as
a
cost
of
receiving
the
interest
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
doing
business
of
the
particular
person
has
a
potential
for
application
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
not
under
the
present
statute,
absolutely
not
under
the
present
statute.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
as
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that
would
be
my
argument
if
i
had
to
make
it
mr.
justice
black.
it
is
agreed
that
congress
has
prevented
that
inquiry
and
therefore,
it
is
not
open
for
question
at
this
time.
now,
search
the
opinion
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
i
have
three
minutes
left
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that
i
can't
tackle
in
three
minutes.
search
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
you
will
find
that
the
peroration
technique
of
eroding
any
governmental
bond
exempt
--
exemption
has
never
been
countenance,
never
been
countenance.
all
the
cases
that
are
mentioned
independently
have
nothing
to
do
with
government
bonds.
where
the
cases
haven't
dealt
with
intergovernmental
immunities
has
never
been
a
case
where
there
has
been
the
payment
of
tax
by
reason
of
the
receipt
of
state
and
local
government
bond
interest.
i
do
have
to
say
this
to
you
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
question
has
been
considered
by
this
court
in
the
post
sixteenth
amendment
cases
in
the
dicta.
they
had
to
be
dicta
because
the
first
act
of
course
preserve
the
exemption
ever
since
it
makes
it
clear
that
that
was
not
affected,
no
change
was
made
by
the
sixteenth
amendment.
we
couldn't
want
a
better
standard
in
tradition
or
a
better
test
than
the
equal
treatment
of
all
classes
of
taxpayers
past
and
present.
none
of
whom
has
ever
paid
a
higher
tax
just
for
having
receive
state
and
local
government
bond
interest.
now,
just
--
on
the
question
with
which
mr.
justice
brennan
opened
with
the
$2,
$5
pieces
of
income,
i
just
--
i
know
your
example
was
hypothetical
but
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the
workings
of
this
act
with
the
adjustment
which
we
think
that
the
congress
required.
you'll
never
going
to
have
--
you
can't
have
this
type
of
a
50:50
arrangement.
you
can't
even
get
up
to
the
20%
ratio.
the
solicitor
general
talks
about.
if
he
got
up
to
five,
i
think
it'd
reach
the
point
where
you'd
practically
have
a
cut
off
by
the
economic
effect.
you
have
a
$141
billion
of
life
insurance
company
assets
to
try
to
fit
into
a
shoe
that
only
has
something
like
$89
billion
of
state
and
municipal
bonds
and
most
of
which
are
put
and
held
by
other
people.
in
conclusion,
we
of
the
state
and
local
government
submit
that
the
petitioner
has
broken
faith
with
congress
in
seeking
to
--
the
tax
and
raising
the
constitutional
issue
which
congress
so
carefully
sought
to
avoid.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
i
have
feared
that.
i
have
feared
that
and
i
think
that
is
why
congress
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
--
didn't
want
you
to
make
the
first
step.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
well,
i
have
been
relying
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
i
have
been
relying
on
the
solicitor
general's
concession
perhaps
unwisely
that
congress
did
not
leave
open
the
question
of
existence
of
our
basic
immunity
for
us
to
make
the
defense
that
would
be
necessary
to
get
into
that
would
take
--
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that
congress
could
waive?
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
oh,
i'm
missing
the
impact
of
your
question.
you're
quite
right.
you
can't
take
the
government
--
the
solicitor
general's
position
and
then
without
confronting
the
question
after
you
come
there
whether
you
have
--
you're
constitutionally
going
to
do
what
he
asked
you
to
do.
you
have
to.
now
i
have
not
cast
my
defense
about
that.
mr.
daniel
b.
goldberg
if
there
is
a
constitutional
immunity.
