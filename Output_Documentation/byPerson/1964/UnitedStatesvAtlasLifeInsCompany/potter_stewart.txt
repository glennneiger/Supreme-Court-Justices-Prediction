your

up
here?

all
the
way
at
back,
i
see.
justice

thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
about
tax
--
taxability
through
the
company
or
its
stockholders,
the
--
stock
companies
or
mutual
companies
are
treated
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
exactly
alike
here,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we're
talking
only
about
income
as

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
insurance
companies,
said
company.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
but
most
of
them
are
--
don't
have
stockholders
anymore,
if
you
know,
there's
many
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
talking
about
the
--
changing
into
those
percentages
of
tax-free
income,
income
after
the
reserved
addition
--
justice
potter
stewart

or
after?
justice
potter

(voice

justice

total?
justice

stewart
total?
justice
potter
stewart
after.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
talking
about
total
per
se.
justice
potter
stewart
taxable?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
whole
income
--
this
is
probably
a
very
stupid
question,
but
if
the
whole
income
came
from
non-taxable
sources,
state,
county
and
municipal
bonds,
there
would
be
no
question,
no
problem
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
no
taxation,
no
tax.
justice
potter
stewart
like
a
conventional
deduction?
justice
potter
stewart
in
ordinary
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
“but
for”
test
that
the
court
applied
in

stewart
wouldn't
require
