mr.
bruce
bromley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
two
principal
questions
are
presented
for
review.
first,
is
it
a
violation
of
due
process
or
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
a
district
court
to
dismiss
a
party's
counterclaims
with
prejudice
for
repeated
and
deliberate
refusals
to
obey
court
crucial
discovery
orders
and
the
final
refusal
to
prosecute
when
the
refusal
decision
was
the
client's
decision
with
full
awareness
of
the
consequences
including
a
dismissal
of
all
of
its
claim
with
prejudice.
and
the
second
question
i
apprehend
is
this,
“is
the
cab
jurisdiction
so
broad
that
the
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
over
claims
alleging
conspiracy
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
prima-facie
torts,
and
breaches
of
contract".
i
hope
i
can
show
that
the
answer
to
each
question
is
no.
in
1960,
howard
hughes
and
his
wholly
owned
company
toolco
(inaudible)
--
induced
the
insurance
companies
and
the
group
of
banks
led
by
irving
to
lend
twa
a
$165
million
to
buy
a
jet
aircraft.
because
of
the
incredible
mismanagement
which
hughes
had
inflicted
upon
twa,
the
loan
was
ultimately
conditioned
upon
toolco's
placing
it
78%
of
stock
of
twa
in
a
voting
trust.
the
purpose
of
the
voting
trust
obviously
was
to
make
sure
that
twa's
management
was
independent
of
hughes
until
our
loans
were
repaid.
now
whatever
degree
of
control
the
voting
trust
represents,
it
was
established
and
limited
by
contract.
it
was
and
is
temporary
and
can
be
terminated
at
any
time
by
twa
without
any
penalty
and
by
toolco
with
only
the
normal
provision
to
make
sure
that
if
a
third
party
buys
out
our
loan,
our
rate
of
return
on
our
money
will
be
secured.
toolco's
repeated
assertions
that
twa's
management
that
is
lender-control
is
hardly
accurate.
the
lenders
have
never
exercised
any
control
over
twa's
management
including
its
decision
to
bring
and
prosecute
the
lawsuit
in
443.
the
actions
of
the
lenders
have
been
confined.
they
were
pointing
two
entirely
independent
trustees,
mr.
hughes
appointing
a
third
which
independent
trustees
promptly
proceeded
to
elect
an
independent
and
outstanding
board
of
directors
and
that's
all
we've
ever
done.
now,
on
february
1962,
the
counterclaims
were
filed
against
twa
and
under
rule
13-h,
we
eight
were
joined
as
additional
defendants.
an
understanding
of
the
counterclaims,
i'm
sure
is
vital
to
show
how
important
discovery
was
to
us
and
also
to
show
that
toolco's
jurisdictional
argument
is
frivolous.
mr.
davis
has
saved
me
the
trouble
of
summarizing
the
counterclaims
except
that
he
hasn't
made
it
quite
accurate.
the
first,
third,
fourth
and
fifth
counterclaims
and
there
are
five
of
them
altogether,
as
the
sixth,
we're
not
concerned
with,
alleged
numerous
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
gist
of
those
charges
is
that
the
additional
defendants
have
conspired
since
prior
to
1956
if
you
please,
to
monopolize
the
trade
of
lending
money
to
air
carriers
have
conspired
to
fix
high
interest
rates
and
have
conspired
to
monopolize
the
tw
market
for
finance
--
twa
market
for
financing.
and
as
an
important
part
of
those
charges,
it
is
alleged
that
we,
the
additional
defendants,
rather
than
hughes
and
toolco
caused
delay
in
the
twa
jet
program,
and
forced
hughes
to
put
toolco's
stock
in
the
voting
trust.
now
those
underlying
facts
are
charged
as
a
prima
facie
tort.
they
are
charged
as
a
violation
of
delaware
state
law,
they
are
charged
as
breaching
a
--
breaches
of
contract.
the
counterclaims
seek
equitable
relief
and
accounting
$45
million
for
twa
derivatively
and
$308
million
for
toolco
as
damages
to
it.
now
the
second
counterclaim
which
so
far
i
have
not
mentioned
seeks
equitable
relief
only.
it
alleges
a
violation
of
section
408
of
the
aviation
act,
by
three
only
of
the
eight
additional
defendants,
metropolitan,
equitable
and
irving.
it
charges
that
metropolitan
and
equitable
are
engaged
in
the
face
of
aeronautics
within
the
meaning
of
section
08
--
408
and
have
unlawfully
obtained
control
of
twa.
now
that
counterclaim
is
the
only
counterclaim
that
has
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
federal
aviation
act
or
the
cab
jurisdiction.
it
was
dismissed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
jurisdictional
reason
as
the
three
named
additional
defendants
had
pleaded
it
should
be.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
these
voluminous
counterclaims
were
obviously
brought
to
bring
pressure
upon
twa's
financing
institutions
to
induce
or
compel
twa
to
drop
its
suit
against
toolco.
but
that
step
was
a
management
decision
with
which
we
lenders
should
not,
would
not,
and
did
not
concern
ourselves.
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
filing
of
these
counterclaims
in
1962,
not
more
than
three
years
ago,
we
additional
defendants
believe
that
the
allegations
of
the
counterclaims
were
false
in
all
material
respects.
we
believe
if
--
that
we
could
show
if
given
the
opportunity
that
hughes
was
personally
responsible
for
many
of
the
acts
alleged
in
the
counterclaims.
we
were
confident
that
we
could
show
that
hughes
himself
had
deliberately
pushed
twa
to
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
in
1960
in
order
to
reach
personal
--
to
reap
personal
tax
benefits
for
himself
and
his
company.
and
we
immediately
on
the
very
day
the
counterclaims
were
filed,
served
a
notice
to
examine
hughes.
we
immediately
started
to
seek
the
kind
of
discovery
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to.
however,
it
took
us
over
a
year
really
to
accomplish
anything
and
then
we
were
met
by
a
blank
wall
and
a
refusal
to
give
us
what
we
clearly
were
entitled
to.
now,
this
obstruction
was
directed
by
the
client.
it's
not
a
case
sir
of
an
unwise
lawyer,
a
careless
lawyer,
a
mistaken
lawyer,
not
at
all.
instead,
it
represents
a
determined
effort
by
hughes
and
his
company
in
which
this
gentleman
was
merely
an
instrument
to
maintain
the
counterclaims
as
long
as
it
could
but
to
prevent
discovery
of
the
facts
at
any
and
all
costs.
now,
there
were
three
separate
categories
of
information
which
hughes
refused
to
produce.
first,
there
were
a
group
of
documents
which
he
refused
to
produce
claiming
they
were
covered
by
the
attorney-client
privilege.
hughes
had
used
his
lawyers
as
we
showed
before
the
special
masters,
business
agents
to
negotiate
the
very
agreements
involved
in
the
counterclaims.
but
these
lawyers
had
made
affidavits
in
this
and
other
cases
as
had
their
clients
which
disclosed
all
of
the
confidential
relationship
between
the
lawyer
and
client.
and
one
of
those
affidavits
as
the
special
master
said
really
constituted
the
first
draft
of
the
counterclaims.
toolco
had
also
pleaded
as
a
defense
to
the
charges
of
the
complaint
that
everything
it
did,
it
did
on
the
advice
of
counsel.
so
do
you
wonder
that
the
special
master
after
looking
at
the
papers
and
hearing
extensive
argument
said
the
privileges
waived
--
been
waived,
produced
that
arguments.
mr.
davis
went
to
the
district
court.
we
argued
it
all
over
again.
the
district
court
affirms
and
produced
the
documents.
davis
wanted
reargument.
the
master
gave
it
to
him.
he
looked
at
the
documents
himself.
he
again
ordered
their
production.
again,
the
court
affirmed.
mr.
davis
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
then
with
the
--
an
appeal
and
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
both
of
which
were
denied
by
that
court.
and
then,
toolco
bluntly
refused
to
produce
the
documents
and
mr.
davis
wrote
a
letter
to
the
court,
the
district
court
below,
on
january
23,
saying
that
toolco
would
not
obey
the
court's
order
and
i
want
to
read
it
to
you.
it's
(b)
--
page
385
at
a
pretrial
hearing,
(b)
is
this
--
at
the
pretrial
hearing,
january
28,
1963
the
court
--
you
wrote
me
a
letter,
mr.
davis
on
january
23rd,
which
has
been
made
part
of
the
record
before
the
special
master.
i
will
just
refer
to
the
last
three
lines
of
the
second
sentence
of
the
letter,
which
read,
“i
must
respectfully
decline
to
comply
with
your
said
orders,
at
least
prior
to
a
determination
of
this
motion
to
dismiss
now
pending
before
your
honor”.
the
judge
continued,
“the
question
i
want
to
ask
you
about
these
three
lines
is,
“did
you
make
this
decision
on
your
own
or
did
you
discuss
this
with
your
client?"
mr.
davis,
“i
discussed
it
with
my
clients
your
honor”.
the
record
shows
that
those
so-called
privilege
documents
were
conveniently
assembled.
it
could
have
been
produced
in
an
instant.
and
yesterday,
mr.
davis
told
your
honors
that
he
gave
those
documents
to
the
district
court
to
do
whatever
it
wanted
with
them.
that
is
untrue.
he
gave
the
documents
to
the
district
court
to
review
in
connection
with
its
ruling
as
any
court
should
do.
the
court
then
returned
the
documents
to
davis
and
ordered
him
to
give
them
to
us
and
we
were
met
with
a
complete
and
blunt
refusal.
now
the
second
deliberate
default
of
toolco
is
with
respect
to
tax
documents.
toolco
said
in
a
footnote
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
12
and
mr.
davis
told
you
yesterday
that
the
tax
documents
after
all
were
just
toolco's
1961
and
1962
tax
returns
which
could
be
handed
over
in
a
moment.
that
is
not
true.
if
you
will
look
at
b-237
to
240,
you
will
see
that
the
documents
in
question
are
listed
in
a
long
schedule
of
23
separate
groups
of
tax
documents
with
all
of
which
we
sought
and
all
of
which
toolco
refused
to
produce.
and
only
the
last
two
of
those
23
groups
concern
1961
or
1962
returns.
all
of
the
remainder
relate
to
pre-1961
tax
information.
and
mr.
davis
knows
very
well
that
much
more
is
involved
than
merely
these
two
little
tax
returns
for
1961
and
1962.
as
page
b235
of
the
record
shows,
mr.
davis
objected
to
the
production
at
one
time
before
the
court
because
as
he
said,
"it
would
take
weeks
to
try
to
gather
all
the
material
called
for."
now
this
information
i
submit
to
the
court,
we
were
confident,
would
have
exposed
hughes'
motives
for
delaying
the
twa
financing.
from
the
document
which
he
did
produce
for
us,
we
believe
that
we
could
show
a
pattern
of
abuse
of
his
control
of
--
to
twa.
and
we
believe
we
could
show
that
the
delay
of
the
1960
financing
was
his
fault
in
the
early
record
of
the
company.
for
example,
we
were
confident
that
the
withheld
documents
would
show
that
toolco
bought
numbers
of
these
jets,
in
fact
all
of
the
jets
instead
of
twa
and
leased
them
to
twa
on
a
day-to-day
basis
in
order
to
make
large
profits
for
toolco
and
for
hughes
which
profits
increased
with
every
days
delay
in
working
out
a
financial
plan.
we
hoped
to
show
that
toolco
charged
off
the
jets
which
it
bought
and
leased
and
accelerated
depreciation
against
which
it
charged
the
daily
rentals.
and
when
it
finally
sold
the
leased
jets
to
twa,
it
sold
them
at
cost
less
straight
line
depreciation,
thus
realizing
millions
of
profits
for
toolco
and
to
the
great
damage
of
twa
and
also
being
able
to
charge
all
these
gains
as
capital
gains
and
not
as
income.
thus,
we
submit
the
documents
had
we
ever
been
able
to
get
hands
on
them,
would
have
tended
to
show
that
hughes
and
not
be
additional
defendants
who
caused
the
damage
to
twa
with
which
we
were
charged
in
the
counterclaims.
moreover,
we
expected
the
hold
--
that
to
show
that
the
withheld
documents
would
show
that
hughes
had
used
twa
as
a
device
to
avoid
tax
so
far
as
toolco
was
(inaudible)
--
concerned,
hughes
owned
a
100%
of
toolco.
toolco
made
enormous
profits,
if
it
declared
dividends,
hughes
would
have
had
to
pay
income
tax
on
them.
if
the
profits
however
were
unreasonably
accumulated
by
toolco,
it
would
have
to
pay
a
substantial
penalty
tax
under
531.
and
to
avoid
both
taxes,
hughes
may
well
have
kept
twa
impoverished
so
that
toolco
could
justify
its
otherwise
unreasonable
accumulations
by
reference
to
twa's
needs.
further
examples
of
what
we
--
were
sure
--
we
could
or
hopefully
could
prove
by
these
documents
and
by
hughes'
examination
are
18
and
19
of
our
brief.
now
both
the
special
master
and
the
court
found
good
cause
for
and
ordered
production
of
these
documents.
hughes
--
toolco
refused
to
produce
them
although
they
were
readily
available.
and
at
a
time
of
neither
of
these
defaults,
if
you
please,
was
there
any
assertion
that
they
were
justified
by
panagra
or
by
any
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
ordering
court.
the
third
default
was
hughes'
refusal
to
appear
for
examination
by
us.
he
would
have
been
i
submit
obviously
the
most
important
witness
from
our
standpoint
in
the
case.
and
with
the
aid
of
the
documents,
we
though
we
could
have
forced
him
to
admit
his
tax
manipulations
and
that
he
had
deliberate
caused
to
his
lawyers
many
of
expert
with
which
we
are
charged.
now
the
date
for
hughes'
examination
was
set
many,
many,
many
times
and
adjourned
on
toolco's
motion.
mr.
bruce
bromley
all
of
this
was
relevant
to
the
counterclaims,
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
to
the
counterclaims.
mr.
bruce
bromley
both.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes
--
but
no,
there
--
i
suppose
there
were
reference
--
they
were
relevant
to
both
because
there
is
an
overlap
between
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
counterclaims.
the
complaint
says
that
toolco
damaged
twa.
twa
says
we
damaged
--
toolco
says
that
we
damaged
twa
as
a
part
of
this.
so
there
is
that
kind
of
an
overlap,
so
these
documents
were
relevant
to
both,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
bruce
bromley
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
bromley
that's
right
your
honor.
and
that's
the
second
question
i
said
was
here
for
review.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
was
starting
to
say
the
third
default
was
hughes'
refusal
to
appear.
there's
no
doubt
that
what
he
refused
to
appear
and
there's
no
doubt
that
toolco
was
told
of
what
the
sanctions
were
and
what
might
happened
and
that
it
was
toolco's
decision
to
make
the
default
in
appearance.
dismissal
of
the
counterclaims
and
with
prejudice
was
justified
under
rule
37
and
rule
41.
now
in
the
link
case,
i
do
not
have
to
remind
you,
i'm
sure
that
his
court
sustained
dismissal
with
prejudice
for
failure
to
prosecute
where
all
that
happened
was
the
plaintiff's
counsel
had
been
lax
in
prosecuting
his
client's
personal
injury
claim
and
had
failed
to
appear
at
the
pretrial
conference.
here
i
say
again
unlikely,
this
refusal
with
the
clients
and
this
case
i
submit
is
far
more
grievous
than
either
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
in
hammond
packing
or
in
link
so
much
so,
that
i
say
to
your
honors
that
i
rely
not
only
on
the
majority
opinion
which
i
think
is
clearly
right,
but
i
also
place
almost
equal
reliance
on
the
dissent.
the
dissent
said
that
no
client
should
be
penalized
for
the
conduct
of
his
lawyer
and
i
quote
from
page
648
of
370
u.s.,
unless
notice
is
given
to
the
client
himself
that
such
a
threat
hangs
over
his
head,
"such
a
rule
would
do
nothing
more
that
incorporate
basic
constitutional
requirements
of
fairness
into
the
administration
of
justice
of
this
country".
i
turn
now
to
the
argument
that
toolco
makes
to
excuse
its
conduct
below.
mr.
bruce
bromley
we
served
a
notice
to
examine
toolco
through
hughes,
its
managing
agent.
nobody
was
ever
able
to
catch
him
to
serve
him
with
the
subpoena
except
that
finally
under
the
courts
prodding,
mr.
davis
accepted
a
subpoena
in
--
on
the
complaint
on
hughes'
behalf.
but
far
as
the
counterclaim
--
i
rely
on
my
notice
to
examine
toolco
through
hughes'
managing
agent.
that
was
never
challenged
by
the
way
that
he
was
the
manning
agent
--
managing
agent
and
the
notice
was
proper.
so
on
the
basis
of
this
complaint
it
was
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
i
didn't
get
service
on
him
himself
and
i
didn't
have
to
mr.
justice
clark
because
under
the
rule,
i
was
entitled
to
his
appearance,
as
manning
--
managing
agent
of
toolco.
i
didn't
try
to
serve
him
with
the
subpoena.
i
didn't
have
to.
now
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
which
mr.
davis
says
he
filed
with
the
cab,
he
asked
the
court
for
a
stay
and
three
times
he
told
the
court
that
he
was
not
seeking
a
voluntary
dismissal
but
only
a
stay.
he
now
concedes
the
stay
would
have
been
improper.
he
contends
now
that
the
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
counterclaims
even
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
discovery.
i
say
that
argument
as
applied
to
the
counterclaims
is
frivolous.
the
argument
that
he
makes
here
is
quite
different
from
what
he
made
to
443.
in
443,
he
said
i
have
a
lot
of
orders
from
the
cab
going
way
back
to
1944
in
which
all
of
toolco's
conduct
was
approved.
mr.
bruce
bromley
37
(d)
--
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d).
mr.
bruce
bromley
if
a
party
or
an
officer
or
a
managing
agent
of
a
party
willfully
fails
to
appear
before
the
officer
and
was
to
take
his
deposition
after
being
served
with
a
proper
notice.
mr.
bruce
bromley
the
party
sir.
mr.
bruce
bromley
of
course,
i
submit
this
rule
says
clearly
and
has
been
so
interpreted
time
and
time
again
that
it's
sufficient
to
serve
the
party.
that
calls
upon
the
party
to
produce
the
managing
agent.
and
since
here,
toolco
was
hughes
and
hughes
was
toolco,
it
was
merely
calling
upon
hughes
to
produce
himself.
i
say
in
the
complaint
mr.
davis
says,
“i
have
a
lot
orders
from
the
cab”.
in
this
case,
he
has
no
orders.
his
claim
is
that
we
defendants
may
as
a
result
of
his
complaint
sometime
in
the
future
obtain
a
good
defense
to
his
counterclaims.
he
urges
this
might
be
so
because
the
cab
at
some
future
time
he
says
may
issue
an
order
retroactively
approving
our
acquisition
of
control
of
twa
1960.
and
he
says
that
might
retroactively
exempt
all
of
our
conduct.
now,
in
fact
nothing
that
the
cab
might
ever
do,
could
in
anyway
exempt
us
from
liability
from
any
of
the
acts
alleged
in
the
counterclaims.
section
414,
the
only
exemptive
section,
provides
that
a
person
affected
by
an
order
under
408
shall
be
exempted
from
the
operations
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
other
restraints
insofar
as
maybe
necessary
to
enable
such
person
to
do
anything
authorized,
required
or
proved
by
such
order.
clearly,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
panagra
and
the
cab
confirms
in
its
amicus
brief
here,
this
section
has
only
perspective
application
and
thus
relates
only
to
acts
taken
by
an
affected
person
after
the
entry
of
an
order,
under
section
408,
if
such
an
order
in
the
future
could
not
possibly
exempt,
could
not
possibly
be
construed
to
reach
backwards
prior
to
1956
and
exempt
us
from
all
the
asserted
liabilities.
in
making
the
argument
for
the
cab
order
might
have
this
impossible
retroactive
effect
of
eliminating
private
lawsuits,
toolco
also
overlooks
entirely
section
1106
of
the
act
which
provides
that
nothing
contained
in
this
chapter
shall
in
any
way
abridge
or
alter
the
remedies
now
existing
at
common
law
or
by
statute
but
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
are
in
addition
to
such
remedies.
now,
toolco
places
so
far
up
until
today
--
maybe
today
a
great
reliance
in
panagra.
but
of
course,
as
you
all
realized
full
well,
panagra
involved
only
an
agreement
to
allocate
air
rules.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no
sir.
i
said
they'd
--
they
didn't
--
mr.
bruce
bromley
to
this
extent
sir,
i
said
they
did
not
raised
panagra
or
any
lack
of
jurisdictional
argument.
it
didn't
need
panagra
to
have
any
lawyer
realized
that
there
was
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
bruce
bromley
no,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
say
so.
well,
panagra
dealt
with
air
routes
and
air
carriers
and
tariffs
of
the
air
carrier's
subsidiary.
and
the
only
question
presented
is
that
department
of
justice
under
the
antitrust
laws
are
the
cab,
the
proper
ones
to
act.
now,
section
411
under
which
that
proceeding
was
brought
does
--
this
is
not
included
under
section
414,
the
exemptive
section.
so,
if
there
was
any
contention
that
our
act
came
under
11,
we
couldn't
possibly
be
exempted
by
it.
now,
i
submit
that
the
record
supports
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
hughes
and
toolco
in
this
matter
looked
upon
discovery
as
some
sort
of
a
gain
and
that
toolco's
position
regarding
jurisdiction
is
and
was
nothing
more
than
a
part
of
that
game,
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
harass
the
additional
defendants,
try
to
get
them
to
call
off
the
suit
against
toolco
without
giving
the
additional
defendants
an
opportunity
to
establish
that
the
counterclaims
had
no
support
in
fact.
and
i
submission
--
i
submit
for
these
two
reasons
that
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
in
all
respect.
now
finally,
the
client
here
toolco,
not
only
had
notice
and
directed
a
default
but
that
default
continued
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
after
we
got
up
there,
mr.
justice
kaufman
repeatedly
asked
davis
whether
if
that
court
reversed
on
--
conditioned
on
hughes'
appearance
--
hughes
would
comply
with
the
order
to
appear
and
mr.
davis
would
not
even
then
agree
that
hughes
would
appear
and
i
submit
sirs
that
the
time
to
negotiate
with
this
gentleman
has
passed
and
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
