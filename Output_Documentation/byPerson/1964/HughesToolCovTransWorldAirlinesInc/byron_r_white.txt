justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
ever
have
a
plan
and
under
what
circumstances
would
you
have
a
chance
to
have
reviewed
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
entry
of
the
default
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
--
i
take
it
mr.
sonnett,
it's
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
that
are
hereof?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
entry
of
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
were
perfectly
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
the
point
here.
so
that
issue
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
propriety
of
the
default
judgment,
we
think
is
here
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
want
to
reach
that
question,
do
you
have
any
objection
of
the
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
ground
before
the
matter
was
found.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
assumption
is
that
default
judgment
is
entered
on
what
was
alleged
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
ever
prove
if
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
the
complaint
said,
what
the
whole
judgment
said
that
actually
happened
didn't
happen,
how
would
you
ever
prove
that
the
judgment
was
false
if
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
is
alleged
to
have
happened
didn't
happen
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
prove
that
--
probably
how
can
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
actual
conduct
then
is
admitted.
the
actual
event
has
occurred
was
admitted.
it's
just
whether
or
not
they're
violating
the
law
and
not
what
was
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
though
what
you
said
is
this
--
i
thought
you
said
that
the
--
that
in
making
their
business
decision,
they
thought
that
the
damage
would
be
less
than
cost
examined?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
just
inconsistent.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
i
gather
it
would
be
helpful
to
both
of
you,
to
get
this
question
so
as
to
not
criticize
whether
it
really
is
open
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
--
mr.
sonnett,
do
you
think
they
made
that
decision
based
on
the
assumptions
that
they
were
wrong
on
the
cab
jurisdiction,
that
it
would
cost
them
$35
or
$45
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
really
are
saying
and
if
they
were
making
a
$145
million
business
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
--
whatever
results
that
they're
worth
that
--
that
is
exactly
what
you
are
saying
the
kind
of
decision
they
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
the
cost
of
(voice
overlap)
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
you
gamble
that
that
much
on
their
being
right
on
the
cab
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
have
been
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
--
you
still
have
a
question
on
what's
scope
of
your
(inaudible)
judgment
law
whether
in
doing
this,
you
wanted
us
to
say
that
the
district
court
(a)
could
enter
a
default
judgment
or
(b)
that
default
judgment
would
foreclose
everything
except
for
mathematical
computation
of
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
judgment,
i
take
it,
it
didn't
include
or
conceding
that
the
allegations
and
the
complaint
were
true
or
--
were
true
or
that
you
have
been
damaged
by
the
allegation
--
by
the
conduct
alleged
in
the
complaint
or
in
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
--
apparently
then
they
get
a
review
you're
--
perhaps
they're
willing
to
--
not
only
to
default
but
also
to
force
the
district
court
to
enter
default
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
would
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
except
for
the
--
except
the
default
judgment,
you
never
would
have
gotten
your
review
on
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
davis,
whether
or
not
the
cab
holds
the
--
that
these
people
have
violated
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
and
whether
or
not
we
think
here
that
there's
any
supersession
at
all,
you
were
still
interested
in
maintaining
your
counterclaim
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
even
if
the
cab
was
to
act
first,
you
nevertheless
have
the
claim
for
damages
to
be
adjudicated
to
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bromley,
are
there
some
specific
provision
of
the
rule
that
provides
for
dismissal
of
the
claim
where
a
corporation
failed
to
produce
his
managing
agent?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
where
the
--
what
line
does
--
where
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
who's
to
be
served,
the
managing
agent
or
the
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
this
--
how
does
the
managing
agent
go
for
the
--
refused
--
they
must
be
served.
