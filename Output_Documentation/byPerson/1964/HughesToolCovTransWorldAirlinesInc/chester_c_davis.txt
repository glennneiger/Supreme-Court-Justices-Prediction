mr.
chester
c.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
chester
davis,
counsel
of
the
hughes
tool
company
and
i've
lived
three-and-a-half
years
with
this
case
now
and
i
cannot
tell
you
how
much
i
appreciate
this
opportunity
to
address
to
court
with
respect
to
the
issue
which
it
involved.
number
443
and
501
which
is
on
the
counter
nearly
following
this
one
are
really
companion
cases.
it's
only
from
certiorari
granted
to
the
second
circuit,
443
involved
the
compliant,
501
involved
the
counterclaims.
the
issue
in
443
is
whether
the
district
court
had
a
jurisdiction
under
the
antitrust
laws,
there
were
no
diversity
of
citizenship,
that's
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction,
of
a
complaint
by
twa
against
its
78%
stockholder,
the
hughes
tool
company,
the
complaint
which
was
filed
by
a
new
lender
controlled
management
who
had
acquired
control
of
twa
by
insisting
upon
a
voting
trust
as
a
condition
to
making
certain
senior
financing
available
to
twa
in
1960
for
the
purpose
of
financing
some
jet
aircraft
and
who
insisted
about
a
22%
premium
as
a
condition
to
a
repayment
of
those
advances.
and
that
is
--
that
involved
the
issues
in
501.
now,
in
order
to
appreciate
the
legal
questions
which
are
here
involve,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
would
take
a
little
time
to
describe
the
origin
of
this
--
of
relationship
between
toolco,
hughes
tool
company,
we
refer
in
the
record
as
toolco
and
twa.
in
1944
the
cab
under
the
federal
aviation
act,
better
known
as
civil
aeronautics
act,
review
the
origin
of
the
interest
of
the
hughes
or
mr.
hughes
in
a
hughes
tool
company
and
twa
and
found
that
that
because
as
a
result
of
invitation
by
the
then
president
twa,
frey
inviting
mr.
hughes
to
develop
an
interest
in
the
airline
which
has
been
unquestionably
a
sick
airline.
and
mr.
hughes
develop
an
interest
in
the
development
of
the
constellation
aircraft
by
lockheed
and
as
a
result
of
that,
i'm
referring
to
now
what
the
cab
found
in
1945,
found
that
that
since
the
tool
company
had
placed
the
orders
for
these
lockheed
constellations
for
the
benefit
of
twa
with
the
intent
of
assigning
those
aircraft
of
twa,
the
tool
company
even
though
primarily
engaged
in
providing
drilling
press
to
the
oil
business
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
person
engaged
in
the
phase
of
aeronautics
within
the
meaning
of
section
408
and
as
a
“dealer”
in
aircraft.
and
therefore
had
a
public
hearing
under
408
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
relationship,
at
that
time,
the
tool
company
had
approximately
45%
of
the
outstanding
capital
stock
of
twa
and
therefore
was
a
controlling
stockholder
of
twa,
whether
or
not
that
relationship
was
permissible
under
the
standards
of
federal
aviation
act
pursuant
to
408.
it
held
hearings
and
it
concluded
in
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest.
in
so
doing,
it
said,
i'm
referring
now
to
what
appeared
in
68
(b)
at
156,
it's
also
referred
to
in
the
footnote
of
our
main
brief
at
page
13,
that
the
obvious
if
not
the
expressed
purpose
of
these
arrangements
was
to
give
twa
the
benefit
of
the
credit
and
financial
standing
of
hughes
tool
any
transaction
involving
substantial
financial
responsibility.
at
that
time,
however,
the
cab
was
aware
of
the
duty
that
the
congress
have
placed
upon
it
and
to
reconcile
the
public
interest
involved
by
antitrust
laws
and
the
public
interest
involved
under
the
federal
aviation
act.
we
were
all
aware
of
the
fact
that
prior
to
1934,
there
was,
if
i
may
describe,
the
scandalous
situation
in
existence
where
aircraft
manufacturers
were
in
control
of
commercial
airlines,
and
in
the
air
mail
act
of
1934,
there
was
flat
provision
against
it,
the
continuation
of
that
relationship
between
an
aircraft
manufacturer
supply
of
aircraft
in
an
airline.
following
the
recommendation
of
federal
aviation
commission,
the
congress
the
adopted
the
regulatory
approach
and
passed
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938,
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1950
are
identical
for
the
purposes
of
consideration
here.
namely,
to
place
the
control
relationship
of
a
person
engaged
in
the
phase
of
aeronautics
with
an
airline
under
the
regulatory
regime
of
the
cab
and
if
approved
by
the
cab,
the
exemptions
of
414
are
triggered
in
those
exempts
the
person
who
is
subject
to
a
cab
order
from
all
of
the
antitrust
laws
or
any
other
law
applicable.
now,
in
view
of
that
responsibility
and
based
upon
the
recommendation
of
department
of
justice
and
the
public
counsel
in
1945,
what
the
cab
did
was
to
impose
a
condition
upon
that
relationship.
it
prohibited
any
transaction
in
excess
of
$200
between
the
tool
company
and
twa
without
obtaining
further
cab
approval.
that
was
the
way
in
which
cab
intended
it
to
regulate
and
control
the
relationship
created
between
someone
it's
found
to
be
engaged
in
the
phase
of
aeronautics
and
the
airline.
it
is
not
disputed
that
each
and
every
subsequent
transaction
between
the
tool
company
and
twa,
rendering
financial
assistance
of
providing
or
furnishing
aircraft
was
submitted
to
cab
and
was
specifically
approved
by
the
cab
under
section
408.
in
1947,
after
some
of
--
business
--
the
business
was
given.
twa
was
in
need
of
additional
funds
and
the
tool
company
provided
it
with
it
a
loan
of
$10
million
with
an
agreement
that
it
was
to
have
a
majority
of
the
board
of
twa,
and
also
which
provided
that
additional
acquisition
of
equipment
by
twa
was
to
be
approved
by
the
hughes
tool
company.
they
want
to
control
the
condition
of
making
this
$10
million
available.
the
$10
million
loan
was
also
convertible
and
if
converted,
it
would
have
given
tool
company
in
excess
of
70%
of
the
outstanding
stock.
the
cab,
on
its
own
initiative,
started
another
set
of
hearings
in
1950
by
reason
of
what
they
referred
to
this
further
control
relationship
between
the
hughes
tool
company
and
twa.
at
that
time,
both
public
counsel
contended
and
the
examiner
held
that
it
would
--
it
would
be
necessary
to
review
the
entire
relationship,
the
matter
in
which
assistance
have
theretofore
being
given
and
the
way
to
describe
in
all
aspect
of
matters
relating
to
financing,
management,
related
activities
and
particularly
with
the
respect
to
equipment
acquisition.
the
examiner
stated
in
effect
this
requires
an
examination
of
the
activities
of
the
controlling
corporation
with
respect
to
twa
for
the
period
during
which
the
prior
approved
control
existed.
it
also
justified
having
another
public
hearing
on
the
ground
that
that
under
this
new
agreement,
a
control
relationship
has
been
established
with
the
control
company,
that
is
twa,
which
formally
responded
to
orders
from
one
person
with
the
assistance
from
others
by
proxy
having
only
45%
of
the
outstanding
stock,
now
responds
or
may
respond
to
one
person
at
its
sole
instance.
the
result
of
that
hearing
after
a
finding
by
the
cab
that
twa
occupied
a
very
important
place
of
this
country's
domestic
and
international
air
transportation
system,
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
shortly
after
they
approved
the
regional
relationship
situation
to
cab
did
immediately
thereafter
grants
some
additional
routes
in
twa
including
some
international
route,
making
it
for
the
first
time
a
competitive
pan-am
because
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
develop
a
competitive
pan-am,
pan-am
to
the
contrary,
notwithstanding.
and
therefore,
the
cab
after
making
those
findings
concluded
that
it
was
in
a
public
interest
to
permit
this
further
control
relationship
to
be
created
and
established.
following
that,
the
tool
company
from
time
to
time
furnished
assistance
to
twa
in
various
ways.
our
brief
describes
these
various
transactional
orders
as
i
call
them,
they
are
about
18
in
number
and
which
cover
each
and
every
time
that
tool
company
gave
any
assistance
to
twa
by
way
of
financing
or
by
way
of
aircraft.
the
aircraft
that
were
furnished
to
twa
through
the
tool
company
were
acquired
from
four
of
the
five
supplies
of
aircraft
to
air
carriers
in
the
first
war
period
namely,
lockheed,
boeing,
martin,
convair.
in
many
instances,
toolco
supplied
financial
assistance
to
enable
twa
to
acquire
aircraft
from
others,
this
hold
from
the
orders,
number
22,
these
transactional
orders
reveal
that.
and
from
time
to
time,
the
tool
company
furnished
further
assistance
by
giving
--
by
providing
equity
or
by
guarantying
obligations
of
twa.
now,
these
transactional
orders
do
reveal
the
facts
and
circumstances
as
to
why
it
was
necessary
for
the
tool
company
some
time
to
place
the
order
for
twa
than
assign
the
contracts
for
provider's
assistance,
most
of
the
time
it
was
because
of
the
stranglehold
the
equitable
life
insurance
company
had
over
the
airlines
with
respect
to
loans
and
financing,
versus
you
find
in
one
of
the
--
one
i‘d
have
to
pick
out
page
23
in
my
brief
of
these
transactional
orders
which
provide
that
it
is
impossible
for
twa
acquire
aircraft
without
obtaining
prior
consents
or
waivers
under
various
financial
arrangements
it
has
entered
into
in
the
past.
in
other
words,
the
equitable
had
provided
some
funds
or
through
the
use
of
negative
covenants
and
other
restrictive
provisions,
it
was
necessary
in
fact
for
twa
to
go
and
obtain
consent
with
respect
to
anything
that
they
wanted
to
do.
and
there
is
no
question
that
during
that
period
time,
a
certain
amount
of
friction
developed
between
these
lending
institutions
and
the
tool
company
which
made
reputed
efforts
to
finance
twa,
as
i
say
in
manners
not
approved
by
those
lending
institutions.
now,
this
situation
continued
until
1960,
i
may
say
the
pride
of
that
in
1956
again
became
apparent
that
twa
needed
some
funds
with
which
to
go
into
the
jet
program
and
look
another
$10
million
which
the
cab
approved,
was
made
available
through
twa
by
the
tool
company.
at
one
point,
the
tool
company
contemplated
itself
going
to
the
manufacture
of
jet
aircraft.
as
soon
as
they
did
that
the
cab
initiated
on
its
own
another
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
--
if
the
tool
company
did
become
a
manufacturer
of
aircraft,
whether
or
not
another
hearing
could
determine
the
public
interest
should
not
be
held.
it
so
happened
that
the
complaint
itself
recognized
that
the
tool
company
did
not
pursue
those
plans
and
that
investigation
by
cab
was
abandoned.
in
1960,
in
order
to
obtain
financing
for
badly
needed
jet
aircraft
by
twa,
these
lending
institutions
as
referred
to
in
the
counterclaims
in
501
got
together
and
refused
to
provide
that
financing
except
on
the
condition
that
tool
company
placed
in
a
voting
trust,
control
--
to
be
controlled
by
them
with
78%
stock
interest
for
twa
and
which
also
provide
that
tool
company
could
not
repurchase
the
obligations
of
these
insurance
company
to
receive
without
paying
the
22%
premium.
so
i
don't
suppose
insurance
company
were
really
interested
in
getting
their
money
back,
they
wish
for
something
else,
and
today
then,
thereby
acquired
control,
fully
control
of
twa
at
the
end
of
1960.
a
few
months
later,
this
complaint
was
filed.
and
this
complaint
charges
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
sherman-1,
sherman-2,
clayton-3,
clayton-7,
all
of
them,
on
the
ground
that
the
tool
company
exercised
its
control
over
twa
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
aircraft
and
the
financing
of
aircraft
in
violation
of
the
antirust
laws.
at
the
same
time,
it
is
admitted
that
we
did
not
violate
the
federal
aviation
acts,
that
there
were
no
transactions
that
were
not
approved
by
the
cab,
and
they
would
violate
any
cab
orders.
at
times,
see
this
memorandum
reply
to
our
reply
brief,
counsel
for
twa
appears
to
be
saying
that
what
they
are
claiming
is
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
not
by
their
conduct
in
supplying
aircraft
but
in
preventing
twa
from
getting
additional
aircraft,
the
more
aircraft
which
was
needed.
well,
the
complaint
is
obviously
very
well
drawn,
very
artfully
drawn
by
counsel
extremely
learned
in
the
antitrust
field,
more
so
than
i
am
certainly.
but
i
suggest
this,
your
honor,
that
no
matter
how
you
look
at
this
complaint,
there
is
one
thing
which
is
certain.
it
is
talking
about
the
conduct
to
the
tool
company
as
a
controlling
stockholder
of
twa
exercising
control
over
twa
to
be
sure.
and
it
relates
to
the
manner
in
which
twa
acquired
aircraft
from
manufacturers
either
directly
or
through
the
tool
company.
that's
all
they
can
be
talking
about.
in
fact,
i
think
that
the
most
candid
summarization
of
the
complaint
comes
from
counsel
for
twa
before
--
when
we
went
before
the
district
court
in
which
he
said,
“the
crux
of
such
violations
rest
upon
toolco's
acts
and
efforts
through
the
exercise
of
the
stock
control
over
twa,
to
control
and
dictate
the
manner
and
method
by
which
twa
acquired
aircraft,
and
the
necessary
financing
therefore.”
and
twa's
chief
executive
officer
on
deposition
described
the
compliant
as
being,
“based
upon
the
fact
that
mr.
hughes
preempted
to
himself
the
procurement
of
planes
and
the
financing
of
twa's
operations”.
he
noted,
the
compliant
does
not
charge
any
agreement
or
understanding
between
toolco,
any
manufacturer
of
aircraft,
or
any
other
so-called
supplier
of
aircraft.
it
looks
such
contention
has
made.
there
was
a
charge
of
a
conspiracy
with
atlas
corporation,
would
not
name
as
a
defendant
name
within
the
complaint,
but
that
relates
to
an
alleged
effort
to
merge
northeast
airlines
and
twa,
which
of
course
require
cab
approval.
in
fact,
the
agreements
itself
was
subject
to
cab
approval
as
well
as
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
minority
stockholders
of
twa,
by
provision
of
the
contract.
but
the
plaintiff
claims
that
this
was
part
of
conspiracy
to
enlarge
the
equipment
needs
of
twa.
i
frankly
--
i'm
always
get
lost
when
i
try
to
understand
the
just
--
where
is
the
area
of
antirust
violation
that
this
complaint
is
really
talking
about
but
i
don't
reach
that
point
to
answer
the
question
that
is
posed
because
i
am
relying
basically
upon
the
supercession
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
reflected
by
the
federal
aviation
act
when
i
have
orders
of
the
board
under
section
408,
also
under
section
409
which
deals
with
any
interlocking
relationships
between
the
person
engaged
in
the
phase
of
aeronautics
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
chester
c.
davis
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
although
when
you
refer
to
the
entry
of
default
judgment,
i
was
--
i'm
going
to
explain
the
circumstances
which
lead
to
that
order,
the
question
which
the
court
of
appeals
limited
itself
in
interlocutory
--
has
never
been
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
limited
its
interlocutory
review
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
by
reason
of
the
federal
aviation
act
and
by
the
reason
of
these
transactional
orders
of
approval.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
probably
has
a
power
to
address
itself
to
any
question
which
it
do,
and
i'm
prepared
to
address
myself
to
any
--
to
any
questions.
i
understand
the
posture
of
the
case
to
be
--
a
determination
of
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
over
this
complaint,
which
involved
to
my
mind
the
federal
aviation
act,
the
cab
orders,
whether
or
not
the
complaint
does
in
fact
state
the
cause
of
action
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
--
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
we'll
i
don't
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
it
is
correct
your
honor.
it
does
deal,
however,
with
whether
or
not
the
allegation
of
this
complaint
do
in
fact
describe
a
conduct
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
law,
irrespective
of
the
federal
aviation
act.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
yes.
in
other
words,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
--
excuse
me?
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
presumably
if
the
matter
went
a
damage
hearing,
and
the
final
judgment
entered,
i
suppose
that
that
time
i
would
have
a
rather
review
of
the
circumstances
on
which
it
was
entered.
i'm
hopeful
that
i
will
be
able
to
stop
what
i've
been
trying
to
stop
for
some
time
as
i
did
unnecessary
expenditure
of
time
and
money
when
we
know
because
at
some
point,
even
for
damages,
you've
got
to
show
some
proximate
correlational
relationship
with
that
at
some
point.
the
facts
have
to
come
out
that
there
is
no
basis
for
claiming
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
problem
we've
had
today
has
been,
we
have
a
complaint
which
said
we
violated
the
antitrust
law.
and
the
problem
which
has
been
in
the
fallacy
and
the
problem
which
we
find
running
through
cab
brief
for
example,
amicus
is,
well,
we
never
approved
any
boycotts.
we
never
approved
any
tie
end.of
course,
we
did,
nobody
asked
them
to.
but
the
thing
which
conferred
jurisdiction
upon
the
court,
i
submit,
is
not
the
use
of
evidence,
but
is
by
the
description
of
a
conduct.
it's
--
the
cab
has
jurisdictional
of
a
conduct
and
i
think
the
problem
that
has
or
the
confusion
that
developed
has
been
on
the
one
hand
saying,
“well,
this
complaint
adequately
complies
with
the
notice
pleading
requirements
that
alleges
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws”.
and
the
problem
of
when
we
our
concerned
with
jurisdiction
and
that's
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction
of
discovering
in
the
complaint
a
description
of
a
conduct
which
it
proved
could
constitute
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
otherwise,
i
submit
that
the
concept
of
primary
or
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
an
agency
over
the
court
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
skill
of
the
--
of
the
plaintiff.
if
we
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
court
merely
by
taking
any
kind
of
conduct,
losing
your
dog
if
you
please,
and
i
cast
to
the
conduct
and
say
in
losing
your
dog
or
in
spite
of
it,
you
violated
the
antitrust
laws
and
i
stop.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
yes.
but,
in
one
way
you
can
reach
that
question,
your
honor,
i
mean
that
would
be,
that
if
you
were
to
conclude
that
there
was
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
make
adequate
inquiries
of
the
plaintiff,
or
if
you
please
follow
the
recommendation
of
daily
ranking
with
the
special
master
whose
recommendation
was
rejected
by
the
district
court
of
finding
out
the
basis
for
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
support
the
contention
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
violated.
because
--
i
mean,
perhaps,
i
should
explain
how
this
so-called
order
of
default
came
about.
immediately
following
the
filling
of
the
complaint,
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
before
i
answer.
the
district
court
took
the
position
and
advised
me
in
open
court
that
based
upon
the
decisions
of
the
circuit
and
decisions
of
this
court,
it
was
very
difficult
to
dismiss
a
compliant
which
on
the
face
of
the
alleged
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
therefore
suggest
i
hold
it
in
advance.
i
had
obtained
priority
and
discovery
on
the
basis
that
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
find
out
what
the
complaint
is
all
about.
so,
i
said
that
i
thought
i
could
establish
during
the
discovery
of
twa,
for
twa,
for
them,
i
would
be
able
to
establish
that
there
was
no
basis
for
contending
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
and
so
i
proceeded
on
that
basis.
it
came
a
time
however,
when
i
found
through
discovery
and
through
documents
that
were
produced
to
me
from
these
lending
institutions
that
part
of
their
--
of
their
technique
would
go
on,
to
insist
upon
the
digging
of
deposition
of
mr.
hughes
in
california.
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
extended
one,
it
was
going
to
be
a
burdensome
one,
it
was
going
to
be
an
expensive
one.
complaint
had
been
filed
in
the
field
and
other
things
have
been
going
on.
there
came
a
time
particularly
after
i
found
that
twa
disclaimed
any
knowledge
of
any
facts.
they
were
in
the
hands
of
counsel,
and
counsel
had
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
work
product.
and
pursuant
to
the
recommendation
mr.
rankin,
i
filed
for
a
rule
16
proceeding,
i
also
submitted
a
number
of
detailed
interrogatories
to
compel
a
disclosure
of
facts
of
conduct
as
distinguished
on
conclusions
and
pleadings.
at
the
same
time,
this
court
came
down
with
the
panagra
decision,
i
see
that
i
only
have
five
minutes
left
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
save
my
time
for
rebuttal,
but
just
let
me
say
very
quickly
that
the
time
came
after
the
court
denied
by
motion
to
dismiss,
refused
to
submit
the
manner
to
--
for
interlocutory
appeal,
refused
to
certify
it,
i
came
to
the
conclusion,
i
did
it,
if
i
was
wrong
--
i'm
sorry,
but
i
did
it.
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
my
client
was
better
off
by
resting
on
the
merits
of
this
position,
than
to
undertake
the
burden
expense
of
the
kind
of
discovery
that
they
were
contemplating.
therefore,
i
rest
on
my
position,
the
court
invited
sanctions
under
37,
use
of
37
language,
calling
it
a
willful
default,
and
at
that
time
did
grant
me
a
certification,
and
the
court
of
appeals'
limited
review
on
the
matter
as
i
have
indicated.
may
i
save
the
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
chester
c.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
perhaps,
i
ought
to
address
myself
to
this
business
decision
because
it
seems
to
be
the
most
important
thing
that's
being
discussed
here
today.
i'm
responsible
for
it.
it's
rather
simple.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
immediately
after
the
compliant
was
filed,
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
i
did
not
believe
that
this
complaint
did
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
court.
when
this
court
came
down
with
its
decision
on
panagra
i
was
confident
in
my
conviction.
i
brought
on
for
hearing
my
motion
of
dismiss.
it
was
denied.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
below
denied
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
to
compel
the
plaintiff
to
disclose
the
factual
conduct
on
which
he
was
relying
for
the
purpose
of
these
allegations.
i
discussed
this
matter
with
mr.
holliday
of
the
hughes
tool
company
and
we
determine
that
to
permit
this
discovery,
which
i've
find
out
they
were
planning
upon
as
part
of
the
documentary
record
of
what
their
plan
was,
we
would
--
having
to
pay
78%
of
their
cost
meaning
78%
stockholder,
plus
the
burden
of
expense
upon
us
would
be
more
than
a
conceivable
amount
of
damages
that
could
be
established
by
reason
of
our
conduct
much
less
by
reason
of
our
conduct
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
i
was
convinced
that
was
right
on
the
law,
i
believe
so
then,
i
believe
so
now,
i
admit
the
responsibility,
i
took
it
and
i
decided
that
that
the
law
as
i
understood
it,
they
have
not
justified
this
plaintiff
to
subject
us
to
an
effect
what
was
a
judgment
for
several
million
dollars
as
what
amounted
to
the
practical
matter.
now,
should
i
be
wrong,
then
the
facts
still
have
to
come
out
i
believe.
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
find
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
this
is
our
subsidiary,
we
own
80%
of
it,
why
would
we
hurt
it,
what
difference
is
to
make
antirust
law
wise
whether
or
not
the
orders
for
aircraft
are
placed
by
mr.
tillinghast
or
by
mr.
hughes?
mr.
chester
c.
davis
no
your
honor,
no
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
i
never
had
a
review
of
that
decision
of
the
propriety
of
the
discovery
orders
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
review
them.
so
the
propriety
of
the
conduct
of
the
district
court
has
never
been
reviewed
and
i
have
an
opportunity
to
address
myself
to
any
court
on
that.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
no,
i
never
went
this
mathematical
computation.
i'd
rather
decide
not
to
talk
that
way
that
as
being
default.
actually
i
tried
to
get
a
review
of
that
question
at
the
time
that
the
court
denied
my
motion
to
dismiss
and
have
the
court
at
that
time
bearing
the
certification
of
the
question
i
could've
done
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
subsequently
did
with
any
such
default.
and
this
business
if
i'm
not
producing
documents
that
were
on
the
record
is
clear
(voice
overlap).
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
the
motion
of
dismiss
was
obviously
based
upon
the
face
of
the
complaint
as
to
whether
or
not
the
face
of
the
complaint
alleged
the
course
of
conduct
which
did
conclude
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
court.
i
question
that.
when
the
court
refused
to
grant
me
the
certification
required
for
1292
(b)
is
when
i
then
made
the
so
called
business
decision.
based
then
with
that
denial,
denied
me
a
right
to
get
a
review
of
that
question
of
law.
they
compel
me
to
undertake
the
burden
expense
of
that
discovery
is
when
i
concluded
rightly
or
wrongly
that
i
would
rest
on
the
merits
of
my
legal
position.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
i
never
--
in
my
way
i
never
defaulted
here
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
your
honor,
i
just
said
after
the
district
court
denied
my
motion
of
dismiss,
denied
my
interlocutory,
my
certification
for
review,
then
i
said
i
rested
on
the
merits
of
my
position
and
indeed
invite
that
the
district
court
is
correct
at
that
time
to
enter
whatever
it
thought
was
an
appropriate
judgment
that
would
give
me
an
appellate
review
of
this
legal
question.
what
the
court
then
did
was
to
apply
the
language
of
37
calling
it
a
willful
default
and
then
certified
the
same
legal
question
that
took
me
to
district
court.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
i
never
had
enough
opportunity
to
argue
it
your
honor.
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
--
the
record
is
there
as
to
what
occurred.
i
never
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals.
if
your
honor
would
give
me
a
little
more
time,
i
would
be
glad
to
address
myself
of
that
question.
i
just
never
have
addressed
myself
to
that
question
either
below
or
here,
not
in
my
briefs
nor
in
my
oral
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that
is
correct.
it
declined
to
do
so,
possibly
to
see
that
the
--
but
i
would
be
subject
to
do
something
if
i
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
i
mean
i
never
resisted
to
the
--
i
did
disagree
with
the
district
court
refusal
to
compel
the
plaintiff
to
disclose
the
factual
basis
of
the
complaint
by
denying
the
rule
16
proceeding
recommended
by
mr.
rankin.
i
also
disagree
as
a
matter
of
law
as
to
the
propriety
of
having
refused
the
--
mr.
rankin
had
ordered
the
answer
to
my
interrogatories
to
be
answered
and
the
district
court
failed
to
permit
that
to
take
place.
i
disagree
with
that
aspect
to
be
of
the
discovery
orders.
i
also
disagree
because
they
submitted
that
there
were
attorney-client
privilege
documents
involved.
what
i
did
there,
i
turned
them
over
to
the
court
to
do
what
is
with
them.
i
refused
if
you
want
to
use
that
word
to
waive
my
attorney-client
privilege.
i
believe
the
court
made
an
error
in
applying
the
law
as
to
what
constitutes
the
waiver
of
attorney-client
privilege
documents.
but
i
had
to
do
that.
if
i
were
to
give
them
up
voluntarily,
i
would
--
i've
lost
my
privilege
forever.
so
what
i
did,
i
turned
them
over
to
the
court
rather
than
turning
over
to
the
party.
insofar,
these
other
documents
that
he's
talking
about,
again
all
attached
documents
to
1960,
they're
talking
about
something
to
subsequently
--
subsequent
to
1960.
what
relevancy?
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
objection
giving
them
that
except
the
time
to
give
them
both
documents
came
up
after
i
take
my
notes
--
i
took
my
statement
of
position.
and
therefore,
at
that
point
there
was
--
i
was
subject
to
whatever
the
outcome
was
and
there
was
no
reason
that
i
could
see
for
them
furnishing
any
further
documents.
so,
this
talk
about
the
deliberate
refusal
to
produce
documents
just
isn't
supported
by
the
record,
however
they'd
be
construed
by
my
brother.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
and
--
no,
and
the
right
to
review
the
propriety
of
the
decision
made
by
the
court
today.
no,
i
found
my
statement
of
position
before
any
sanctions
was
imposed,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
what
happened
was
that
after
the
court
to
refuse
to
grant
certification
for
a
review
of
its
refusal
to
grant
my
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
and
before
there
was
any
date
for
mr.
hughes
aiming
it
to
take
place
but
after
conferring
with
my
client
and
discussing
this
cost
of
damages
that
was
described,
i
then
filed
a
document
to
the
court
stating
what
in
effect
unstated
in
the
record
which
was
that
the
tool
company
was
resting
on
the
merits
of
the
position
theretofore
taken
and
that
i
was
prepared
to
take
my
chances
on
appellate
review
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
legal
position
that
we
are
taking
and
then
explain
the
reason
for
it,
namely
that
i
thought
my
client
that
--
the
decision
of
the
court
to
that
point
had
a
practical
effect
as
imposing
a
judgment
of
$7
million
on
my
client.
paying
in
effect
78%
of
the
cost
to
twa
plus
100%
of
its
own
cost
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
extensive
and
burdensome
discovery
which
i
found
in
documents
produced
by
one
of
this
lending
institutions,
was
part
of
their
plan
to
make
it
expensive
for
us
to
defend
this
antitrust
action
seeking
a
divestiture
of
our
stock.
and
that
i
was
better
off
financially
to
stop
where
i
was
and
obtain
an
appellate
review
of
my
legal
position,
then
to
be
subjected
to
the
burden
and
harassment
and
cost,
78%
of
it.
i
have
to
pay
because
i'm
78%
stockholder.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
business,
same
way
as
i
explain.
the
court
then
said,
“alright,
if
that
is
your
position,
in
other
words,
you
rest
on
the
merits
of
your
position.”
i
said,
“that
is
correct.”
they
said,
“do
you
understand
that
by
doing
so,
you
take
the
risk
that
i
may
impose
sanctions
on
the
37?”
i
said,
“i
understand
that
also
but
i
understand
that
sanction
under
37
are
remedial
and
not
punitive
because
i
was
not
interfering
with
a
judicial
process
of
the
court.
i
was
not
being
contemptuous
in
the
sense
of
preventing
the
court
from
doing
whatever
it
had
a
power
to
do.
to
be
sure,
i
was
denied
a
private
right
for
my
subsidiary
suing
me,
that's
what
i
was
doing.”
but
i'm
not
in
the
position
that
my
brother
oftentimes
likes
to
refer
to
the
john
l.
louise
case
and
other
--
those
kind
of
cases
where
i
refused
to
give
up
something
and
thereby
interfere
with
the
judicial
process.
i
wasn't
doing
that.
i
--
it
is
true
i
did
not
agree
with
the
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
which
subjected
me
to
an
effect
a
penalty
by
compelling
me
to
litigate
something
which
i
don't
think
simply
litigated.
i
don't
want
to
go
to
nine
years
of
litigation
as
in
panagra
to
be
dismissed.
i
want
to
find
out
now
that
i
was
not
entitled
to
be
subjected
to
this
effort
to
retain
by
the
lending
institutions,
as
i
will
point
out
501
to
retain
control
of
twa
for
their
own
purposes.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
number
501
involves
the
basic
controversy
between
the
use
--
two
company
and
the
additional
defendants.
and
that
is
whether
twa
should
be
controlled
by
stockholders
or
by
the
lending
institutions
we
claim
have
monopolized
the
supplying
of
senior
financing
to
the
major
airlines
of
the
united
states.
in
order
to
address
myself,
or
for
the
court
to
address
itself
to
the
issues
which
are
involved
in
connection
with
the
dismissal
of
those
counterclaims
with
prejudice,
i
think
it
is
important
that
i'd
spend
sometime
to
explain
the
nature
of
those
counterclaims
and
the
facts
which
i've
described
at
those
counterclaims
in
which
underlie
the
legal
theories
under
which
they
have
been
brought.
the
counterclaims
alleged
that
the
equitable
and
the
metropolitan
together
with
another
insurance
company
have
in
fact
a
monopoly
on
the
supplying
of
senior
long-term
financing
to
major
airlines.
and
that
they
abused
their
dominant
position
in
that
field,
if
not
a
monopolistic
position
in
that
field,
to
interfere
with
and
acquire
control
over
the
management
of
various
airlines.
and
this
has
been
accomplished
by
a
variety
of
means.
now
counterclaims
described
in
some
detail
the
conduct
which
we
claimed
these
additional
defendants
have
engaged
in.
it
involves
the
use
of
the
traditional
lender
concept.
it
involves
of
the
use
of
interlocking
relationships.
it
involves
the
use
of
terms
and
conditions
in
connection
with
the
financing
they
supply
unrelated
to
--
in
a
reasonable
needs
of
a
lender
and
the
use
of
negative
covenants
in
connection
of
those
terms
and
conditions
so
as
to
achieve
their
objectives.
we
also
claim
in
these
counterclaims
that
these
additional
defendants
entered
into
a
conspiracy
among
themselves
as
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
basis
upon
which
they
would
make
their
financing
available.
more
particularly
insofar
as
twa
was
concerned,
one
of
the
principle
means
were
used
was
this
insistence
upon
management
clauses
and
voting
trusts,
not
as
means
of
remedies
in
the
events
of
default,
that
we
would
not
object
to,
but
as
conditions
preceding
to
making
any
senior
financing
available.
now
--
well,
your
honor
there's
a
difference
between
a
lender
who
said,
“if
you
don't
pay
your
interest
on
time,
if
you
don't
pay
the
installments
on
time,
i'm
going
to
take
over
control
of
the
business”.
and
it's
another
thing
for
lenders
to
get
together
and
say,
“i'm
going
to
take
control
of
your
business
before
i
lend
you
any
money”.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
the
point
the
--
your
honor
is
that
my
counterclaim
do
allege
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
violations
of
the
federal
aviation
act
from
one
single
course
of
conduct.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
i
made
a
motion
for
a
stay
actually
your
honor
which
was
denied.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
the
actual
motion
that
i
made
below
was
a
motion
for
a
stay.
i
attempted
to
suspend
litigation
when
it
became
apparent
that
i
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
complete
and
adequate
relief.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that's
the
effect
of
what
i've
done
your
honor.
the
--
my
--
the
additional
defendants
claim
that
i
should've
used
those
words.
the
words
--
what
actually
happened
was
that
after
they
filed
their
reply
asserting
as
a
defense
cab
approval.
i
decided
to
suspend
litigation.
i
made
--
i
filed
a
complaint
with
the
cab.
i
made
a
motion
for
a
stay
of
all
further
proceeding
in
the
counterclaims
until
the
cab
acted.
this
was
denied
from
the
bench,
and
i
was
told
that
in
my
--
the
imposition
of
the
dismissal
with
prejudice,
i
did
not
inform
in
those
words
make
a
motion
for
a
voluntary
nonsuit.
those
are
the
facts
of
the
record.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
my
position
on
that
is
as
the
second
circuit
did
recognized
that
additional
defendants
don't
dispute
the
cab
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
violation
of
the
federal
aviation
act
and
certainly
over
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
reverse
it
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
i
think
a
reversal
would
be
enough
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
because
i
have
a
complaint
before
the
cab,
i
am
not
asking
to
stay
in
the
court
below
until
after
the
cab
has
acted.
i
believe
that
my
statute
of
limitations
will
not
run
until
after
the
cab
has
acted,
at
least
i've
got
the
confidence
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
that
regard,
petition
for
cert
has
been
granted
and
to
some
extent,
i'm
dependent
upon
what
this
court
will
say
on
that
question.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
which
will
permit
the
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that's
right,
i
want
a
reversal
of
this
dismissal
with
prejudice
which
they
are
using
to
interfere
with
my
action
before
the
cab
claiming
that
the
cab
should
not
consider
the
complaint
i
have
before
them,
until
the
cab
has
acted
on
the
violations
of
federal
aviation
act
and
then
permit
me
to
go
after
them
to
waive
--
i
should
be
able
to
--
but
i
need
some
help
to
do
it.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that's
the
basis
they
put
it
on,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
none,
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that's
an
argument
that
the
irving
trust
has
presented
the
cab
your
honor.
and
all
i
know,
the
cab
has
not
taken
any
action
on
my
complaint.
what
is
inhibiting
them,
i
don't
know.
i'm
suggesting
to
you
the
fact
is
they
have
made
the
argument
that
after
all
these
counterclaims
involved
with
some
--
private
controversy
had
been
dismissed
with
prejudice
and
therefore
the
cab
ought
to
stay
out
of
it.
that's
the
argument
they
presented,
that's
all
i
can
say
your
honor.
i
also
want
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
--
to
point
out
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
no.
the
bureau
of
enforcement
found
that
there
was
a
probable
violation
of
federal
aviation
act,
they
took
an
appeal
to
the
board
itself
and
the
board
has
just
been
sitting
there.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
they
could
be.
it
could
very
well
be,
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
point
that
--
i
recognize
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
below
made
its
decision.
i
submit
that
it
was
error
because
the
question
was
not
whether
or
not
i
was
complying
with
discovery.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
based
upon
the
circumstance
i
was
confronted
with
as
a
claim
and
against
these
people.
i
had
a
right
to
suspend
my
litigation
of
the
counterclaims
without
any
legal
prejudice
to
these
additional
defendants.
and
if
i
have
the
right
to
do
that,
then
of
course
there's
no
discovery
question
at
all.
and
that
is
the
basic
problem
here.
and
the
reason
for
my
going
into
the
nature
--
scope
of
these
counterclaims
is
to
point
out
the
problem
that
here
exist
is
that
this
course
of
conduct
of
describing
my
counterclaim,
described
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
well
as
the
violation
of
federal
aviation
act.
admittedly,
if
it's
a
violation
of
the
federal
aviation
act,
the
cab
has
to
act
first.
if
they
are
engaged
in
the
phase
of
aeronautics
that
they
claimed
they
are,
not
because
they
are
lenders
but
because
of
the
way
they
abuse
their
power
as
lenders
and
have
meshed
themselves
with
the
management
of
other
airlines,
they
have
unquestionably
engaged
with
the
phase
of
aeronautics
now
by
the
reason
of
the
voting
trust.
my
problem
there
is
not
because
i
claimed
there
wasn't
any
approval.
i
claimed
the
cab
never
approved
this
conduct.
but
they
filed
replies
11
days
after
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
panagra
asserting
as
a
defense
that
the
cab
had
approved
their
conduct.
i
have
no
alternative
about
that
point
and
i
suspend
that
litigation
on
the
counterclaims
before
there
was
any
decision
by
judge
metzner
on
my
complaint.
and
it
is
not
a
fact
that
i
made
my
motion
to
suspend
litigation
because
of
discovery
orders
or
because
of
what
happened
to
me
on
the
complaint,
that
is
simply
not
the
fact.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
unquestionably.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
i
have
claims
for
damages.
i
have
claimed
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
other
than
through
the
federal
aviation
act.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
but
i
cannot
get
complete
relief
for
the
action
now
in
the
district
court
until
after
the
cab
has
acted.
and
i
don't
want
to
try
the
same
thing
twice,
number
one
and
number
two,
if
the
cab
were
to
accept
their
contention
that
the
--
they
had
approved
this
voting
trust,
which
the
cab
claimed
they
have
not
and
i'm
sure
they
have
not.
but
nevertheless
they
claimed
it.
then,
they
would
have
the
defense
of
it
to
that
aspect
to
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
by
treating
414
of
the
act.
so
i
claim
that
a
right
as
a
claimant
so
long
as
it
did
not
cause
them
any
legal
prejudice,
that
i
had
a
right
to
suspend
my
prosecution
of
the
counterclaims
at
the
time
that
i
did
but
when
conferred
with
as
a
dismissal
of
prejudice
because
i
found
myself
with
a
position
where
i
could
not
get
complete
and
adequate
relief
admittedly
so
because
admittedly
i
cannot
get
relief
by
reason
of
my
alleged
violation
of
federal
aviation
act.
if
i
state
below,
i
could
not
have
gotten
complete
and
adequate
relief.
and
therefore
i
decided
to
suspend
--
the
only
risk
i
was
taking
was
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
for
a
state
to
avoid
that
problem.
and
that's
the
only
reason
why
i
asked
for
a
stay
rather
than
for
a
voluntary
nonsuit.
i
have
an
absolute
right
to
withdraw
seven
days
before
they
filed
their
reply
under
the
rule.
but
of
course,
while
twa
was
making
a
motion
to
dismiss
these
counterclaims
on
various
grounds
and
implying
approval
by
the
cab,
it
was
not
until
they
filed
a
replies
on
january
23rd
1963
that
they
asserted
as
an
affirmative
defense
an
alleged
approval
by
cab
of
this
voting
trust.
it
is
not
true
to
state
but
i'm
not
before
the
cab
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
defense
by
them.
i'm
before
the
cab
because
of
what
is
a
clear
violation,
in
my
judgment
of
the
federal
aviation
act.
it
was
also
something
i
filed
before
the
cab,
your
honor,
because
of
the
most
shocking
thing
which
took
place
in
december
of
1962
and
that
is
when
after
they
took
control
of
this
airline
in
december
of
1960.
after
six
months
thereafter,
they
filed
a
complaint
seeking
divestiture
of
our
stock
which
we'd
acquire
pursuant
to
the
cab
approval.
after
they
had
imposed
upon
twa
an
additional
loan
of
$147
million
on
terms
and
conditions
that
the
entire
amount
would
mature
all
at
once
if
the
voting
trust
ever
terminated,
what
did
they
do?
without
right
to
vote
78%
of
the
stock,
but
developed
a
plan
to
merge
twa
with
pan
am.
when
the
chief
executive
of
pan
am
and
two
other
directors
were
also
directors
of
the
metropolitan
and
when
the
chief
executive
of
pan
am
is
a
chairman
of
the
finance
committee
of
the
metropolitan.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
both
president
truman
and
president
eisenhower
have
not
accepted
this
doctrine
of
the
chosen
instrument
concept
that
pan
am
has
been
advocating,
what
pan
am
has
done
was
first
to
acquire
american
overseas
airline
and
now,
through
the
metropolitan
tried
to
completely
take
over
twa.
now
that's
what
happened.
that's
what
triggered
--
and
why
is
that
merger
that
--
which
they
filed
with
the
cab
stock
because
of
the
complaint
which
we
filed
before
cab.
now,
the
latest
efforts
of
the
--
these
additional
defendants
in
this
lender
control
management
are
engaged
in
to
prevent
us
and
prevent
the
stockholders
from
controlling
this
airline
occurred
very
recently.
two
--
the
two
company
had
a
contractual
right
to
be
sure
with
the
22%
penalty
if
you
please,
to
pay
back
these
insurance
companies
and
thereby
terminate
the
voting
trust.
well
last
year,
last
summer,
we
went
to
the
cab
for
permission
to
do
just
that.
by
that
time,
the
22%
premium
reduces
and
were
down
to
about
16.5%.
but
that
way,
we'd
also
be
reacquiring
6.5%
and
those
were
presumably
the
premiums
of
the
economic
impact
on
us
with
substantial
but
something
that
--
it
was
important,
it
is
important
to
us
to
regain
control
of
this
airline.
well,
twa
opposed
that
before
the
cab.
twa
--
the
management
of
twa
opposed
before
the
cab
the
right
of
the
two
company,
its
78%
stockholder
to
take
steps
to
pay
back
these
insurance
companies
and
terminate
the
voting
trust.
the
cab
held
that
if
we
dispose
of
our
interest
or
control
of
northeast
airlines
in
1962,
they
permit
us
to
acquire
control
of
another
sick
airline,
northeast
airline.
they
said,
if
we
got
rid
of
northeast
airlines,
then
we
could
go
ahead
and
exercise
our
contractual
rights
to
payoff
these
insurance
companies
and
terminate
the
voting
trust
without
being
involved
a
new
concept,
a
new
acquisition
of
control.
what
does
twa
do?
they
appeal
for
the
second
circuit
and
i'm
sorry
to
say
your
honor,
the
second
circuit
upheld
twa
and
set
aside
the
order
of
the
cab.
that
is
a
matter
which
i
know
the
cab
is
planning
to
file
a
petition
for
a
review,
i
know
i
do.
but
that
is
the
last
thing
which
has
occurred
in
this
struggle
between
the
owners
of
this
airline
and
these
lending
institutions
to
have
acquired
control
of
twa,
to
have
kept
it
as
a
captive
market
for
their
financing
plans
and
other
plans.
and
that
is
basically
clear
your
honor
the
problem
--
the
basic
problem
which
is
involved
in
501.
our
position
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
yes.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
no.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
i
tell
you
the
answer
to
it
is,
the
decision
to
suspend
the
litigation
of
the
counterclaims
did
not
take
place
after
this
business
decision
or
with
it.
it
took
place
before.
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
was
heard
and
decided
at
the
afternoon
of
february
the
6th.on
february
1,
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
court
with
copies
to
the
additional
defendant
telling
them
that
i
was
filing
this
complaint
with
the
cab
and
the
problem
i
had
in
prosecuting
these
counterclaims.
i
filed
my
motion
for
a
stay
of
the
counterclaim
on
the
morning
of
february
6th
before
i
knew
what
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
going
to
be
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
it
is
not
true
as
a
fact
that
the
decision
to
suspend
the
counterclaims
came
after
this
business
decision
had
referred
to
namely
this
--
the
state
--
the
statement
of
position
which
i
took
on
the
complaint.
the
course
of
conduct
that
followed
in
this
counterclaim
is
entirely
independent
to
that.
that
was
the
result
of
things
which
occurred
--
i
was
--
there
were
two
of
us
working
that
--
well,
we're
more
than
two
at
that
point
there
but
we
worked
it
pretty
fast
--
pretty
fast
clearly.
the
sequence
of
events
is
their
replies
asserting
this
defense
was
filed
on
january
23,
11
days
following
the
handing
down
of
the
decision
for
(inaudible)
as
i
recall
came
down
january
14th.
by
february
1,
i
decided
to
make
the
move
before
the
cab.
i
prepared
the
papers,
i
got
them
filed.
i
notified
everybody
on
february
1
in
my
intention
to
suspend
the
litigation
to
counterclaims.
now,
on
the
afternoon
of
february
6th,
the
court
denied
my
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
and
on
february
8th,
this
is
when
i
found
my
statement
of
position
and
suspend
it.
so
far
as
the
discovery
on
the
counterclaims
was
concerned,
i
stopped
the
lit
--
i
stopped
litigating
the
counterclaims
and
announced
my
intention
to
do
so
on
february
1.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
i
announced
on
february
1
by
a
letter
to
the
court
and
to
all
party,
but
by
my
papers,
actually
it
was
not
filed
until
february
6th;
i
see,
i
believe
on
february
5th,
but
anyway,
on
the
morning
of
february
6th,
is
when
i
made
my
motion
for
a
stay.
that
afternoon,
at
five
o'clock
i
believe
it
was
when
the
court
called
us
in,
announced
its
decision
from
the
bench
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
questions
there
were,
“what
about
the
stay
on
the
counterclaims?”
which
had
been
scheduled
to
be
heard
i
think
on
february
18th
--
been
set
out
on
february
18th.
and
then
it's
when
they
--
on
the
6th
or
the
8th,
i
forget
which
date
it
was
when
the
district
court
said,
“well,
we
might
as
well
consider
that
now
too”,
and
denied
my
motion.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
that
is
correct,
but
that
took
place
after
you
see
--
the
action
i
took
on
the
complaint.
i'm
not
pacing
myself
very
well
on
this
either.
i've
got
very
little
time
left,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
in
rebuttal,
but
let
me
say
in
connection
with
something
that
was
mentioned
yesterday,
this
--
the
main
relief
i'm
seeking
on
the
counterclaim
is
to
terminate
this
voting
trust.
i'm
also
claiming
damages,
the
figure
of
$45
million
referred
yesterday
is
that
we
claim
as
damages
against
these
additional
defendants
is
primarily
for
their
conduct,
particularly
their
conduct
after
december
1960
and
has
nothing
to
do
whatever
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
twa
is
claiming
that
its
suffering
by
reason
of
--
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
chester
c.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
chester
c.
davis
if
your
honor
please,
confusion
which
i
think
arise
between
the
position
i'm
taking
of
that
--
of
mr.
--
judge
bromley
is
that
this
is
not
a
situation
of
a
claimant
who
wants
to
continue
to
litigate
and
failed
to
comply
with
the
court
order
as
was
involved
in
the
link
case,
but
this
is
a
question
of
the
right
of
the
claimant
who
said,
“i
cannot
get
complete
and
adequate
relief,
now,
i
want
to
stop
the
litigation”.
in
the
minute
he
says
that,
then
he
has
no
longer
any
obligation
as
i
see
to
produce
anything.
insofar
as
the
counterclaims
are
concerned,
the
confusion
appears
to
be
that
merely
because
in
dividing
the
single
course
of
conduct
and
why
i
claimed
to
be
the
various
ways
to
violate
the
law.
in
my
second
counterclaim
repeating
other
allegations,
i
said
and
this
furthermore
violates
the
federal
aviation
act
of
section
408.
and
everybody
admits
that
i
could
not
get
relief
and
my
central
relief
is
to
terminate
this
voting
trust
and
i
cannot
get
it
from
the
district
court.
and
mr.
bromley
would
like
us
to
overlook
the
fact
that
i
made
the
decision
to
suspend
litigation
on
the
counterclaims
before
i
was
required
to
produce
these
documents
he's
talking
about.
now
let's
talk
about
the
need
of
mr.
hughes
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
themselves
to
defend
themselves
against
the
allegations
of
the
counterclaims
by
reason
of
their
conduct
and
the
way
they
used
their
mono
(inaudible)
--
their
monopolistic
powers
and
conspired
is
beyond
belief.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
these
people
anticipated
my
counterclaims.
in
anticipation
of
my
counterclaim,
they
filed
this
complaint.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
first
the
testimony
of
mr.
tillinghast
which
appeared
in
the
(inaudible)
--
appendix
before
the
court
of
appeals,
a399
when
he
said
--
and
i
was
questioning
about
the
circumstance
under
which
he
authorized
the
filing
of
this
complaint.
i
was
trying
to
find
what
it
was
all
about.
and
he
said,
“i
believe
in
a
telephone
call
to
counsel,
say
that
i
heard
from
mr.
gilmore
some
rumor
and
i
can't
remember
just
what
it
was
at
this
point,
indicative
of
the
fact
that
the
two
companies
might
be
preparing
to
institute
an
action
out
in
los
angeles.
and
therefore
i
thought
we
ought
to
go
right
ahead
with
it
and
not
run
that
risk”.
and
that
should
be
kept
in
line
with
the
testimony
of
mr.
kokey
(ph)
which
i
quoted
in
part
in
my
brief
in
501
at
page
16.
mr.
kokey
(ph)
is
the
senior
vice-president
of
twa.
question:
“do
you
have
any
recollection
of
what
--
if
anything
was
said
about
what
interest
would
be
made
to
obtain
the
deposition
of
mr.
hughes?”
“there
was
a
discussion
that
i
recall".
he
was
referring
to
this
executive
committee
meeting
when
they
decide
to
file
this
complaint."
there
was
a
discussion
that
i
recall
that
one
of
the
reason
twa
was
to
file
the
suit
first
was
to
obtain
the
right
of
prior
deposition.
i
am
not
completely
familiar
with
these
legal
terms
but
i
can
only
state
it
was
obvious
that
twa
had
the
right
for
prior
deposition
that
the
deposition
of
mr.
hughes
will
be
taken
before
the
deposition
of
any
of
the
twa
witnesses.”
and
then
--
this
answer,
“there
had
been
discussions
that
if
it
was
necessary
for
mr.
hughes
to
make
a
deposition,
that
there
would
be
a
probability
that
it
would
be
easier
to
reach
a
settlement,
yes.”
mr.
chester
c.
davis
hughes
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
that
--
the
reason
for
my
suspension
of
the
counterclaim
is
wholly
unrelated
to
the
discovery
of
mr.
hughes
of
any
documents.
that
was
the
problem
of
not
being
able
to
get
adequate
relief.
insofar
as
mr.
bromley,
you're
quite
correct
your
honor,
mr.
bromley
does
try
to
say
that
he
needed
mr.
hughes
very
badly
for
the
purpose
of
the
defense.
the
thing
that
mr.
bromley
did
not
explain
to
your
honor
however
is
how
can
mr.
hughes'
conduct
had
anything
to
do
with
respect
to
what
they
did
subsequent
to
1960
after
the
voting
trust
was
created
and
what
did
mr.
hughes'
activities
have
to
do
with
respect
to
what
is
alleged
in
the
counterclaims
which
is
their
conspiracy
to
make
senior
financing
available
upon
certain
terms
and
conditions.
i
don't
deny
that
it
could
--
arriving
point
in
the
litigation
when
mr.
hughes'
testimony
might
be
important
to
them
and
presumably
they
will
make
a
showing
to
that
effect.
what
is
also
ignored
here
your
honor
is
that
all
the
deposition
that
took
place
by
order
of
judge
metzner,
we
would
not
and
i
was
not
permitted
to
have
any
deposition,
any
discovery
on
the
issue
of
the
counterclaim.
in
that
connection,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
error
in
referring
to
the
record
as
indicating
that
there
had
been
a
lot
of
deposition
taken
on
the
issues
of
the
counterclaims.
there
was
some
deposition
taken
on
the
issues
of
the
complaint.
no
deposition
was
taken
on
the
counterclaims.
they
were
furnished
with
a
mass
of
documents
because
they
were
asking
for
the
same
thing
twa
was
asking
for
and
so
long
as
i
was
producing
the
twa,
i
was
also
giving
it
to
them.
it
is
true.
they
did
certainly
with
a
notice
for
the
production
of
documents
and
for
the
examination
mr.
hughes
as
an
alleged
managing
agent
of
the
tool
company.
but
the
issue
that
is
involved
here
your
honor
is
not
the
question
of
discovery
permitted
or
not
permitted.
the
issue
is
two-fold
and
that
is
primarily
whether
or
not
a
claimant
who
reaches
the
point
where
he
realizes
he
cannot
get
complete
and
adequate
relief,
may
suspend
litigation
without
legal
prejudice
to
the
additional
defendants,
or
any
defendant.
and
the
moment
he
decides
to
stop
prosecuting,
what
duties
and
obligation
does
he
then
act?
the
other
question
which
is
involved
is
the
one
which
it
--
unquestionably
is
more
complicated
that
is
involved
in
443
and
that
is
by
reason
of
the
course
of
conduct
which
i
am
alleging
in
the
counterclaim,
which
unquestionably
involved
the
federal
aviation
act
and
the
cab,
they
admit
it.
there
is
where
you
have
the
question
even
though
we
claim
that
no
orders
of
approval.
they
claim
even
in
their
brief
today,
they
claim
they
got
approval
from
the
cab
for
this
voting
trust.
under
that
state
of
affairs,
i
don't
see
how
any
alternative
but
to
say
then,
i've
got
to
get
relief
from
the
cab
first
before
i
can
continue
to
litigate.
i
cannot
be
on
both
places
at
once.
i
don't
want
to
incur
the
expenses
of
litigation
if
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
the
relief
i'm
seeking,
if
i
have
to
get
relief
from
the
agency
first.
that
is
the
decision
that
was
made
on
february
1.
that
is
all
that
occurred.
what
they're
not
trying
to
do
however
are
trying
to
involve
and
make
this
things
also
complicated
that
this
was
a
question
of
a
deliberate
refusal
on
my
part
to
produce
documents
which
i
had
available
to
produce
to
them.
i
admit
that
with
respect
to
the
attorney-client
privileges
after
i've
exhausted
all
my
legal
remedies,
i
did
make
those
available
to
the
court.
i
did
refuse
to
waive
the
attorney-client
privilege.
now,
what
is
the
confusion
there
is
your
honors
and
--
that
is
a
question
which
--
did
not
plan
to
take
the
time
to
argue,
it
was
recognized
that
all
of
these
documents
that
were
withheld
where
in
fact
communication
between
attorney
and
client.
the
question
was
whether
they
had
been
waived.
we
did
not
claim
the
attorney-client
privilege
with
respect
to
negotiations
or
activities
that
the
lawyers
participated
in.
they
claim
that
it
was
waived
primarily
because
of
an
affidavit
filed
before
the
cab
and
because
of
some
assertions
made
in
my
pleading.
i
claimed
that
until
such
time
as
they
were
entitled
to
the
documents
where
i
could
waive
my
defenses
in
any
event,
so
far
as
i
was
concerned,
i
was
in
no
position
to
waive
the
attorney
client
privilege
and
if
the
court
to
whom
i
physically
surrender
the
documents,
furnished
them
through
these
additional
defendants,
then
so
far
i
was
concerned,
i
was
protecting
my
attorney-client
privilege
to
the
extent
to
which
i
could
at
least
until
after
i
had
appellate
review.
because
i
did
file
for
it,
interlocutory
appellate
review
of
that
question,
it
was
denied
to
me,
not
on
the
merits,
but
they
denied
me
of
the
interlocutory
appeal
and
denied
my
writ
to
bring
up
that
question
for
review.
now,
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
this
leases
and
tax
benefits
since
i'd
like
to
straighten
down
half
a
second.
the
lease
that
they
referred
to
of
course
are
leases
which
--
submitted
to
the
cab
and
approved
by
the
cab
and
it
is
not
true
that
we
were
realizing
any
particular
tax
benefit.
this
argument
that
the
tool
company
--
is
my
time,
i
have
five
--
mr.
chester
c.
davis
i
realized
any
tax
benefit
under
531
is
just
simply
does
not
make
any
sense.
from
the
tax
point
of
view,
it
makes
no
different
whether
the
parent
as
we
were
furnished
additional
capital
funds
to
a
subsidiary
in
form
of
cash
or
provided
that
a
systems
in
the
form
of
making
down
payments
on
orders
for
aircraft
or
for
purchasing
of
aircraft
to
be
made
available
to
the
subsidiary.
and
the
tax
point
of
view,
from
the
531
point
of
view
where
it's
done
this
way
or
that
way,
it
has
exactly
the
same
significance
insofar
as
any
unreasonable
retention
of
income
is
concerned
to
531.
chief
justice,
thank
you
very
much
for
the
extra
time
you've
given
me.
