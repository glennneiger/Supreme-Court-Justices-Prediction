justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
just
want
to
complicate
if
i
will.
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
with
(inaudible)
said,
â€œthat's
the
propriety
(inaudible)
the
complaint
is
not
before
us.
can
we
consider
all
these
financially
(inaudible)
accountability?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
that
--
we
do
not
have
here,
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
on
what
they
decided
the
default
judgment
except
insofar
as
it
relates
in
the
propriety
just
in
the
contrary?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
davis,
outside
of
this
argument
therefore
the
jurisdiction,
you
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
mr.
davis
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
excuse
me
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
a
dismissal
of
prejudice
of
a
lawsuit
because
hughes
was
not
--
mr.
hughes
was
not
available
to
discover,
that's
clear,
is
it
not?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
there
is
no
adjudication
although
it's
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
of
a
lawsuit.
there
is
no
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
the
conduct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
why
does
that
inhibit
you
before
the
cab?
why
would
the
cab
feel
inhibited
in
any
way
in
exercising
its
own
jurisdiction
because
a
court
dismissed
a
claim,
because
a
person
would
not
permit
himself
to
discover?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
are
not
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
have
not,
mr.
davis,
passed
upon
that
argument
as
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
perhaps
the
board
has
been
waiting
an
adjudication
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
davis
(inaudible)
they're
doing?
if
your
business
position
that
you
say
is
(inaudible)
do
you
say
they
have
the
right
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
what
the
(inaudible)
had
said?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
to
deny
your
motion
to
stay
was
in
--
on
february
(inaudible)
and
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
only
the
second
counterclaim
had
reference
to
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
the
court
properly
exercised
that
discretion
and
(inaudible)
allegations
of
that
kind.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
you
made
a
statement
that
they
never
raised
panagra
earlier
in
the
litigation.
but
panagra
was
decided
in
january
1963
so
they
could
not
have
raised
it
much
earlier
than
they
did.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
did
i
misunderstand
you
that
that's
what
i
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand
that,
but
they
could
not
have
raised
panagra
before
panagra
obviously
was
decided?
