mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
the
propriety
of
the
default
judgment
in
this
case
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
your
honor
will
find
that
at
page
1416
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
in
respect
of
the
questions
presented
to
this
court
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
question
was
not
presented.
i
will
cover
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
have
one
preliminary
point
which
will
suggest
and
i
will
come
to
it
right
now
that
perhaps
this
court
should
not
even
reach
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
propose
to
cover
four
points
may
it
please
the
court,
my
first,
is
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
questions,
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted
need
not
be
answered
because
of
judgment
below
was
clearly
correct
on
another
ground.
the
second
point
which
i
propose
to
cover
is
that
although
the
question
is
not
really
before
this
court,
the
compliant
that
does
in
fact
state
causes
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws.
the
complaint
is
adequate
on
its
face,
the
limited
discovery
which
the
defendants
have
permitted
to
occur
to
date
indicates
has
a
substantial
basis
in
fact
for
the
twa
claims
and
that
what
the
defendants
are
really
trying
to
do
is
to
get
partial
or
get
summary
judgment
now
on
the
basis
of
an
incomplete
record.
the
third
point
is
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
does
not
have
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
matters
alleged
in
the
compliant,
and
the
fourth
point
is
that
the
cab
did
not
exempt
in
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws,
any
of
the
conduct
alleged
in
the
complaint.
as
to
the
last
two
points,
of
course
your
honors
have
seen
the
briefs
concluding
the
excellent
belief
that
briefs
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
which
covers
the
last
two
points,
primary
jurisdiction
point
and
the
exemption
point.
should
i
not
be
able
to
reach
those
points
on
oral
argument,
i
would
not
want
it
inferred
by
this
court
that
i
have
decided
to
doubt,
but
that
the
government
was
correct
in
its
brief
anymore
than
i
have
any
doubt
that
twa
was
correct
in
its
brief
on
those
points.
we
think
the
government
brief
in
concluding
that
cab
does
not
have
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
and
in
concluding
that
cab
orders
did
not
exempt
the
matters
alleged
in
the
compliant
was
correct
and
is
correct
and
we
thoroughly
agree
with
that
position.
but
on
examination
of
the
record
of
this
rather
bitterly
contested
litigation
over
the
past
three
years
in
preparation
for
this
argument,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
first
question
stabbed
me
in
the
face
and
i
have
a
duty
to
raise
it
with
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
it
is
not
accepted
as
suggested,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
the
first
two
or
three
pages
of
our
brief.
it
is
referred
to
and
i
must
confess
that
it's
only
upon
my
own
pouring
through
this
record
in
analyzing
what
this
court
was
confronted
with.
but
it
seemed
to
me
perhaps,
that
this
was
a
case
though
they
are
rare
certainly.
they
do
occur
from
time
to
time
where
the
briefs
in
the
oral
argument
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
writ
had
been
improvidently
granted.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
points
since
it
is
not
being
briefed
and
therefore
my
oral
argument
may
be
of
some
assistance
to
the
court
in
that
connection.
the
reasons
why
i
think
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
basically
are
that
the
judgment
below
was
correct
on
the
ground
not
presented
in
the
questions
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
at
that
judgment
below
in
this
case
was
clearly
correct.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
there
was
an
order
mr.
justice
brennan
in
this
case
for
the
entry
of
a
default
judgment
subject
to
the
computation
of
amount
of
damages.
the
court,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
purport
to
consider
whether
that
was
proper
in
terms
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
of
an
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
and
as
well
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
clearly
correct.
and
i
might
say
clearly
correct
on
the
ground
stated
in
a
decision
and
clearly
correct
for
another
reason
which
i
now
come
to.
the
district
court
had
before
the
complaint
obviously
sufficient
on
its
face
at
least,
to
invoke
substantially
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
under
the
antitrust
laws
to
adjudicate
the
matters
alleged
in
that
complaint.
the
district
court
in
a
very
casually
considered
opinion
following
extensive
argument
and
briefing,
reached
the
conclusion
that
that
complaint
was
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
decision
was
not
then
reviewable,
law
was
review
had
of
that
decision.
subsequently,
and
i
might
say
that
district
judge
metzner
who
had
been
appointed
under
our
local
rule
2
as
the
judge
for
all
purposes
with
this
big
case
and
who
has
administering
this
thing
very
effectively,
that
have
been
very
bitterly
litigated
for
well
over
a
year
until
the
defendants
saw
fit
to
default.
judge
metzner
having
decided
that
the
compliant
stated
causes
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
administering
the
pretrial
discovery
and
deposition
proceedings,
having
appointed
former
solicitor
general
lee
rankin
as
a
special
master,
the
supervisor,
depositions
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
judge
metzner
and
special
master,
i
should
put
it
the
other
way
around,
special
master
and
judge
metzner,
finally
got
to
the
point
after
the
defendants
have
had
on
trial
on
discovery
for
well
over
a
year,
of
ordering
some
three
types
of
discovery
for
twa.
your
honors
will
hear
the
companion
case
that
those
orders
extended
also
to
the
benefit
of
the
so-called
additional
defendants.
i
will
not
go
into
them
in
detail.
i
need
not
for
my
purpose,
judge
bromley,
will
cover
that
matter
thoroughly
in
his
argument.
but
what
the
judge
decided
finally
after
all
this
litigation,
was
that
there
were
two
categories
of
documents
that
twa
clearly
had
the
right
to
have
under
the
appropriate
discovery
rules
and
in
light
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
and
the
district
court
held
and
directed,
as
you
will
hear
a
number
of
times,
that
the
defendants
produce
certain
financial
and
tax
information
of
the
hughes
tool
company.
that
information
was
available,
it
could
have
been
produced,
it
was
not
produced,
and
that
was
one
event
of
default.
the
second
event
of
default
related
to
the
refusal
of
the
defendants
to
produce
what
they've
describe
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
is
a
big
batch
of
documents.
these
were
documents
as
to
which
they
had
unsuccessfully
asserted,
the
attorney-client
privilege.
on
this
point,
i
think
it's
important
that
your
honors
realize
as
this
record
shows
that
hughes
tool
company
employed
attorneys
as
business
negotiators,
as
businessman
to
negotiate
deals,
and
financing,
and
plane
acquisitions
and
things
of
that
kind.
in
any
event,
after
thorough
argument,
thorough
consideration,
thorough
briefing,
the
court
below
held
that
these
documents
whatever
privilege
had
attached
to
them
before
will
no
longer
privilege
and
the
court
directed
that
the
tool
company
produce
those
documents.
this
big
batch
of
documents
were
available,
they
were
there,
they
could
have
been
produced,
they
weren't
produced.
they
were
obviously
of
the
most
significant
type
of
information.
that
was
the
second
event
of
default.
now,
the
third
and
most
egregious
of
the
three
had
to
do
with
the
court's
order
that
the
tool
company
produce
how
in
hughes,
it's
sole
stockholder
and
managing
agent
for
a
deposition.
that
history
of
how
that
order
finally
came
to
be
entered,
i
neither
try
take
your
time
on
now.
but
there
was
an
order.
the
order
was
explicit.
the
deposition
hughes
was
set
for
los
angeles
and
the
fact
is
that
on
the
friday
before
the
monday,
when
we
were
all
packing
to
go
out
there,
having
lawyers
and
clerks,
and
having
offices
and
files
and
so
on,
the
counsel
for
the
tool
company
filed
what
he
called
a
notice
of
position
which
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record
which
said
in
effect,
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
further
about
this.
we're
not
going
to
participate
many
more
discovery,
we
stand
on
the
merits
of
our
position
to
date
and
we're
just
not
going
to
participate
and
we're
aware
that
this
deprives
us
of
right
to
litigate
further
except
insofar
as
we
get
appellant
relief
to
litigate
further
on
the
merits
of
this
matter
except
as
to
the
amount
of
damages.
well,
that
led
to
the
intrigue,
led
to
the
commission
of
the
third
default,
counsel
for
the
tool
company
described
that
default
indeed
all
of
these
defaults
as
a
business
decision.
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record
in
this
notice
of
position
a
statement
that
they
calculated
that
the
damages
that
twa
would
recover
although
admittedly
twa
has
been
damaged
at
least
45
million
dollars,
at
least
45
million
admittedly.
as
your
honors
will
come
to
see
in
more
detail
later,
they
calculated
that
the
damages
which
twa
would
recover
in
the
default
hearing
were
less
than
the
expenses
in
taking
hughes'
deposition
that
was
the
alleged
reason
why
they
made
the
business
decision
to
default.
now,
quite
naturally,
i
was
concerned,
less
there
would
be
some
contention
made
that
for
some
reason,
mr.
hughes
couldn't
testify
and
quite
naturally,
district
judge
metzner
was
concerned
and
quite
naturally,
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned.
and
when
there
are
some
reference
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
tool
company
in
the
court
of
appeals
argument
on
november
13,
1963
to
the
possibility
that
perhaps
mr.
hughes
was
an
eccentric
and
maybe
he
didn't
like
to
be
bothered
with
these
kind
of
things
and
so
on.
i
felt
obliged
to
and
i
did
report
to
the
court
of
appeals
a
conference
in
chambers
with
judge
metzner.
with
your
honors
permission,
i
would
like
to
read
what
i
then
said
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
and
is
the
truth.
i
said
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
follows
and
i
read
from
page
122,
your
honors,
of
the
transcript
of
that
argument
which
is
not
in
the
printed
record
before
you.
let's
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
it
has
to
do
with
my
first
point
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
i
think
that
you
should
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
the
court
below
had
sufficient
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
this
case,
sufficient
on
its
face
to
issue
the
discovery
orders,
to
implement
them
by
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
default.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor,
regard
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor,
regardless
of
the
answer
to
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
that
consistent
with
prior
rulings
of
this
court
that
you
--
is
a
decision
below
is
clearly
correct
on
some
other
ground,
you
need
not
to
decide
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh,
none
whatsoever
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
i
do
think
however
because
of
implication
that
might
otherwise
be
created,
this
short
extract
from
the
argument
might
be
helpful
to
the
court,
the
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
may
i
say,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
that
you
need
reach
that
point
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
but
if
you
do,
certainly
i
am
prepared
to
stand
on
your
decision
and
i
think
it
would
be
quite
proper
for
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
powers
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
courts
to
have
a
look
at
that
question
even
if
the
hughes
tool
company
may
not
have
standing
to
raise
it
because
of
their
default.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
would
--
depending
on
what
your
honors
decide
and
write,
and
i
would
think
that
it
neither
would
nor
would
not.
if
your
honors
conclude
that
what
the
court
already
had
done
was
a
proper
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
district
court,
i
would
think
that
will
foreclose
the
matter
in
terms
of
reopening
the
default.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
computation
as
to
the
amount
of
damages
to
be
paid.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
in
a
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
think
there
is
a
very
respectable
authority.
what
i
believe
the
law
today
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
these
being
unliquidated
damages,
the
complaint
alleging
a
clear
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
alleging
that
those
damages
were
caused
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
is
correct,
subject
only
to
our
proof
based
on
what
will
be,
obviously
expert
evidence
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
as
to
the
amount
of
damage.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
i
would
have
difficulty,
that
of
course,
i'd
have
difficulty
proving
anything
in
this
case
without
discovery.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
may
i
suggest
this
mr.
justice
white,
the
pleadings
in
this
case,
the
complaint
and
the
counterclaims
agree
on
one
point.
twa
by
reason
of
what
is
alleged
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
time
to
try
and
describe
it.
your
honors
will
certainly
read
the
complaint.
twa
was
damaged
to
the
extent
of
many
millions
of
dollars.
when
i
made
the
first
testament
of
the
damage,
i
thought
it
was
somewhere
in
excess
of
$35
million.
when
the
hughes
tool
company
made
the
estimate,
they
said
it
was
damages
in
excess
of
45
million,
so
that
you
have
the
twa
and
the
tool
company
agree
that
there's
been
damage
to
twa.
the
only
question
is
who
caused
them?
we
say,
“the
defendants
didn't.”
they
say,
“the
additional
defendants
did
it.”
the
fact
of
damage
is
admitted.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
and
under
the
hammond
packing
case
which
we
have
on
our
brief,
i
think
that
by
reason
of
the
defaults,
certainly
by
reason
of
one,
two,
three
deliberate
and
willful
defaults,
your
honors
must
take
as
admitted
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
are
factual.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
these
are
unliquidated
on
both
cases.
these
are
estimates.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
of
the
studies
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no,
these
are
unliquidated,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
are
going
to
have
to
prove
them
in
terms
of
amount
based
on
the
studies
by
the
experts
who
might
have
working
on
this
for
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
well
over
a
year
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
that
would
be
substantial.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
the
lawyers
--
although
this
court
has
not
really
so
far
as
i
know
written
on
it,
the
first
circuit
has.
i
think
the
issue
of
causation
is
not
an
issue
in
the
hearing
to
be
held.
i
think
that
causation
is
precluded
by
the
default
as
an
allegation
of
facts
that
the
acts
alleged
in
this
complaint
caused
the
injury.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
when
you
consider
that
the
value
mr.
hughes'
investment
in
twa
since
the
new
management
took
over
in
1961
has
increased
by
over
$250
million.
it's
all
relative.
to
me
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
is
what
they
said.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
they
said
that
what
they
were
going
to
have
to
wind
up
paying
us
they
thought
was
going
to
be
last
because
my
friend
mr.
davis
will
of
course
not
agree
with
me
as
to
whether
or
not
causation
is
open.
mr.
davis
would
like
to
have
us
into
a
default
hearing
and
try
the
whole
lawsuit
without
the
benefit
of
any
discovery,
just
as
he
would
have
this
court
give
him
summary
judgment
before
we've
taken
a
word
of
testimony.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
may
i
--
may
i
say
that
in
terms
of
this
court's
having
responsibilities,
my
own
conception
of
what
should
be
done
is
that
i
think
the
court
order
dismiss,
the
writ
is
improvidently
granted.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
mr.
justice
black
which
is
in
opinion
by
mr.
justice
--
by
judge
lombard
is
an
excellent
decision
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
i
think
it
states
the
law
perhaps
as
this
court
would
state
it
but
that
is
on
the
jurisdictional
points.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
we
would
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
nor
would
it
be
to
me
mr.
justice
black
if
that
were
the
fact.
but
that's
not
the
fact
sir.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
what
happened
here
was
we
made
a
motion
for
the
entry
of
a
default
judgment
based
on
the
three
acts
of
default
which
i
have
described.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
district
judge
metzner
granted
that
motion
because
of
a
deliberate,
purposeful,
intentional,
business
decision
by
the
defendants,
not
to
defend
although
as
i
am
prepared
to
demonstrate
to
you,
they
could
have
complied
if
they
would
have
which
each
--
with
each
of
the
three
orders.
there'd
be
so
called
business
decision
was
obviously
for
the
reason
that
they
knew
that
if
we
have
ever
got
our
hands
on
the
evidence
we
were
looking
for,
it
was
going
to
cause
them
a
lot
more
money,
mr.
justice
black,
than
the
amount
they
thought
their
going
to
have
to
pay.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
say
that
under
the
old
hammond
packing
case,
i
think
that
this
court
very
long
ago
indicated
certainly
under
many
more
recent
decisions
that
your
honor
will
have
in
mind,
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
is
not
going
to
be
taken
very
lightly.
and
when
a
court
makes
three
separate
orders
for
a
defendant
to
perform
acts
which
that
defendant
can
perform
in
a
case
of
which
that
court
has
at
least
colorable
jurisdiction
and
it's
much
more
than
that
here.
there
comes
a
time,
i
submit.
when
a
defendants
going
to
comply
with
the
court
order
and
suffer
the
consequences
involved.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
under
rule
37,
your
honor
the
rule
quite
clearly
gives
the
district
court
the
power
and
discretion
to
do
exactly
what
was
done
here.
and
what
else
is
a
plaintiff
to
do?
a
plaintiff
who
has
got
the
burden
of
going
ahead
and
litigating
a
lawsuit
and
the
defendants
simply
says,
“no,
i
will
not
disclose
this
information.”
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
--
oh,
i
know.
i'm
sorry
if
i
sounded
too
(voice
overlap)
but
i've
been
trying
to
get
--
i've
been
trying
to
get
these
facts
of
the
financial
documents.
i've
been
trying
to
get
this
so-called
privilege
documents,
and
i
have
been
trying
to
examine
how
it's
used
for
several
years
without
success.
now
may
i,
before
my
time
express,
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
is
correct
and
moreover
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
with
respect
to
which
have
granted
the
writ
do
not
include
this
question
nor
do
they
include
the
question
whether
the
compliant
states
cause
of
action.
i
raise
with
this
court
the
question
whether
the
writ
should
not
be
dismissed
as
improper
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decisions
below
was
so
clearly
correct
on
another
ground,
and
that
is
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
handle
this
case.
this
is
not
a
case
of
excusable
neglect
or
accident.
this
is
a
case
of
a
deliberate
purposeful,
business
decision
not
to
produce
evidence,
which
the
united
states
district
court
said,
“you
shall
produce,”
and
it's
that
simple.
on
that
ground,
i
submit
that
the
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh,
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
that's
very
much
money
to
the
hughes
tool
company,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
so
they
said.
i
take
it
from
their
word,
with
the
kind
of
money
that
the
hughes
tool
company
derived
out
of
twa
alone,
well
that's
not
much
money.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
that's
exactly
right.
i'm
saying
that
they
were
being
artful
of
what
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
yes
and
i
want
to
make
one
point
clear
if
i
may
mr.
justice
white
before
that
red
light
is
on
and
that
is
i
want
to
have
perfectly
well
understood
by
this
court
that
there
wasn't
any
reason
suggested
below
or
suggested
here,
why
they
could've
handed
over
the
documents
that
they
had
available.
they
were
there.
there
wasn't
any
reason
either
why
mr.
hughes
couldn't
have
testified
if
he
saw
it
fit
to
do
so,
and
i
do
want
to
read
to
you
if
i
may
just
a
short
extract
from
the
court
of
appeals'
argument,
so
that,
once
and
for
all,
any
ghost
has
laid
to
rest.
this
is
not
a
case
of
inability
to
testify,
it's
a
case
of
a
deliberate,
purposeful
decision
not
to
testify.
now,
what
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
but
what
do
we
do
about
the
testimony
of
mr.
hughes,
mr.
justice
black?
he's
the
man
who
according
to
the
district
court,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
indeed
by
the
admission
of
the
tool
company
is
the
most
important
witness
in
the
case.
we
have
a
perfect
right
under
the
rules
to
take
his
deposition.
there
is
no
reason
why
he
can't
testify,
it's
simply
that
he
preferred
to
play
this
game
having
no
valid
reason.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
court
could
have
done
exactly
what
it
did
do.
the
fact
the
answer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
the
court
--
we
had
a
--
well
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
in
terms
of
the
individual,
this
takes
a
little
time
on
a
procedural
problem,
i'll
make
it
very
brief.
on
behalf
of
twa,
i
tried
to
have
a
subpoena
served
on
how
it
used
for
several
years.
we
spend
a
lot
of
money
and
we
couldn't
find
them.
it's
still
illusive.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
maybe
the
fbi
could
have.
but
our
fellows
who
are
ex-fbi
agents
couldn't
and
we
had
a
lot
of
--
and
we
couldn't.
we've
finally
got
to
the
point
where
the
court
recognize
him
and
that
he
was
the
management
agent
of
the
tool
company
directed
the
tool
company
to
produce
them
and
that
obligation
was
accepted.
it's
a
complicated
procedural
story
but
sufficed
to
say
that
tool
company
was
under
a
valid
obligation
to
produce
mr.
hughes,
mr.
hughes
who
owned
the
100%
of
the
tool
company
just
said,
“i'm
not
going
to
be
bothered,
and
that
was
that
and
do
what
you
like
about
it.”
that's
how
simple
it
is.
this
is
not
a
case
and
if
i
may
just
read
--
if
may
just
read
--
i'll
read
it
very
quickly
too.
at
page
122
of
the
transcript
of
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals,
“i
think
i
am
--”
this
is
sonnett
speaking.
“i
think
i
am
entitled
to
report
to
this
court
as
an
officer
of
this
court
that
in
a
conference
in
judge
metzner's
chambers,
on
this
very
question,
when
mr.
davis
was
filling
this
affidavit
which
he
says
is
sealed,”
incidentally
that's
of
no
consequence
i
might
add,
as
if
there
was
something
of
consequence
in
it,
there
isn't.
but
after
at
that
conference
on
january
16,
1963
judge
metzner
specifically
directed
the
question
to
mr.
davis,
“are
you
saying
that
there
is
any
medical
reason
or
any
reason
of
that
type
why
this
man
can't
testify,
because
if
you
are,
the
record
before
me
is
deficient.”
continuing
after
the
quote,
mr.
davis
specifically
and
flatly
answered
the
question
by
saying,
“no.
he
was
not
making
any
such
confession
--
contention.
this
isn't
a
case
where
the
man
can't
testify.
it's
a
case
where
the
man
won't
testify.
it
is
that
simple.”
