are
you
thinking
the
position
that
we
do
reach
the
question
of
the
default
judgment
is
either
we
should
affirm
it,
make
it
a
final
judgment
subject
to
no
further
attack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
issue
you
think
would
have
to
be
reached?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
result
confines
--
the
district
court
would
be
compelled
to
accept
your
argument
to
that
final
default
judgment
stayed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
we
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
we
do
not
reach
but
would
dispose
of
it
on
some
of
the
ground
it
advanced
do
you
still
take
the
position
that
when
you
get
back
to
the
district
court,
this
powers
to
relieve
the
defendant
from
the
default
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
would
happen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
happen
in
practical
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
this
question
because
you
fail
here
the
idea
was
45
million
or
$35
to
$45
million
default
judgment
because
the
lawyer
may
have
made
a
mistake
about
filing
the
papers.
it's
not
very
appealing
to
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
though
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
now,
do
you
still
insist
even
though
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this,
the
fact
that
they
fail
to
let
you
have
it,
justify
lender's
default
judgment
of
i
don't
care
whether
you
call
it
default
or
not,
that's
what
they
call
that
in
my
state
rather
they
failed
to
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whether
it's
a
default
judgment
or
not,
you
want
that
to
stand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
the
nature
of
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
criticizing
the
plaintiff's
arguments.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
basis,
you
would
of
course
have
a
right,
i
assume,
for
citing
for
contempt,
the
show
contempt
that
they
later
delivered
the
paper
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
order
him
to
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
it
do
to
him
if
he
didn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
something
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
--
without
settling
that
merits
of
the
whole
controversy,
they
could
have
ordered
him
to
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
find
them
whatever
it
took
to
get
him
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
made
the
court's
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let
me
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
that
was
relevant
with
reference
to
the
antitrust
proceeding,
is
that
right?
what
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
counterclaim
only?
justice
hugo

for
the
claims
only?
