chief

warren
i
understood
judge
bromley
to
say
that
your
counterclaim
alleged
certain
conduct
on
the
part
of
these
added
defendants
and
the
effect
of
that
conduct
on
their
part
so
far
as
twa
was
concerned
and
i
understood
him
to
say
that
they
proposed
to
prove
and
could
prove
that
this
was
actually
the
conduct
of
mr.
hughes
personally
and
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
effect
of
it
on
twa.
now,
i
may
have
been
mistaken
but
that's
the
way
i
understood
it.
and
if
so,
if
that
is
true,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
as
to
whether
mr.
hughes
is
a
proper
witness?
