justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
and
ask
you
one
question?
but
if
we
should
not
agree
with
your
on
your
supercession
argument,
are
you
making
any
other
argument
addressed
propriety
to
the
entry
of
the
default
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
to
say
then
that
you
can't
accept
on
the
basis
of
error
in
the
--
either
the
two
questions
decided
on
the
interlocutory
appeal,
you
can't
really
address
yourself
otherwise
on
the
default
judgment
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my,
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
hypothesis
is
that
we
may
not
agree
with
you
on
your
supercession
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
argument,
now,
what
else
--
i
don't
read
your
brief,
really
as
i'm
sure
you
haven't
enough
of
it
but
i
don't
read
them
as
dealing
otherwise
with
the
propriety
--
the
entry
with
the
default
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
independently
of
the
supercession
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
just
make
clear
the
difficulty
that
i'm
having.
this
is
on
the
premise
and
i
don't
like
to
suggesting
this,
but
of
course
thinking
it
all
that
i
don't
know
yet
whether
i'm
going
to
agree
with
you
or
not.
but
if
we
should
not
agree
with
you
either
on
the
supercession
argument
or
that
otherwise
the
compliant
is
fairly
stated
an
antirust
laws
violation,
if
we
should
not,
then
my
problems
is
how
do
we
reach
the
question
of
the
propriety
on
the
default
judgment?
i
think
it's
a
different
problem
on
--
in
the
next
case.
i
won't
bother
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
the
appeal
was
an
interlocutory
appeal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
was
it
limited
to
the
two
issues.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
position
is
that
other
--
i
gather,
that
except
this
--
the
petitioner
prevailed
on
either
of
these
two
arguments,
if
there
is
anything
else
that
he
is
entitled
to
address
to
the
default
judgment,
they
will
have
to
do
that
after
a
final
judgment
has
entered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
is
the
fourth
judgment
presented
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
whether
was,
is
that
the
judgment
you
say
rest
on
the
ground
which
suppose
to
lead
us
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it's
also
admitted
that
in
fact,
i
didn't
understand
this
mr.
sonnett,
that
this
agreement
at
least
45
million
of
damage
being
suffered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
is
this
purpose
for
mr.
rankin
that
will
accept
multiplied
by
three?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
it
was
an
--
well,
are
going
to
ask
for
more
than
45
million?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
tried
at
least
for
fourth
of
45
million?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
only
in
terms
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
in
terms
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
terms
of
amount,
not
as
mr.
justice
white
suggest
in
terms
of
causal
connection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
pretty
expensive
business
decision,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
mr.
sonnett,
i
must
confess
in
my
total
suprise,
he
tells
us
that
we
can
get
to
an
issue
to
the
propriety
of
that
default
judgment.
he
suggests
a
reason
why,
do
you
want
us
to
get
through
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
either
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
you
think
there
was
another
way
of
the
district
court
giving
you
that
review
without
entering
the
default
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
telling
us
that
the
(inaudible)
counterclaim
or
are
you
telling
us
that
this
is
part
of
your
motion
to
dismiss
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
you
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
without
prejudice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
made
a
motion
which
says
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
is
filing
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
we
have
before
us,
in
this
case
i
gather
is
the
judgment
dismissing
with
prejudice,
accepted
to
that
one
count
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
was
superseded
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
did
they
find
--
what
i
--
that
(inaudible)
all
gotten
so
confused
yesterday.
i
don't
know
that
i'm
going
straighten
that
out
today
but
--
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
dismissal
with
prejudice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
reverse
it
and
say
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you
want
then
--
do
i
understand
you
is
that
a
reversal
which
will
permit
you
to
stay
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
counterclaims?
