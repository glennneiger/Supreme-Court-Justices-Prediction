mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
august
of
24th
1958,
approximately
15
months
after
the
illegal
seizure,
searches
and
seizure
in
the
mapp
versus
ohio,
petitioner
was
subjected
to
a
series
of
illegal
searches
and
seizures
involving
his
home,
his
person
and
his
place
of
business.
i
believe
that
the
state
of
louisiana
admits
that
these
seizures
were
unconstitutional
under
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
three
weeks
after
these
searches,
he
was
charged
with
the
crime
which
was
wholly
unrelated
to
the
original
search.
he
was
convicted
of
this
crime
of
burglary
and
sentenced
to
nine
years
in
prison.
after
his,
the
case
of
mapp
versus
ohio,
the
petitioner
began
a
series
of
pro
se
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
finally
ended
in
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
below.
i
believe
that
the
state
of
louisiana
has
conceded
that
he
has
exhausted
his
advantages
by
the
opinion
below
and
the
issue
presented
in
the
opinion
below
was
whether
or
not
the
rule
of
mapp
versus
ohio
should
be
applied
retroactively
to
effect
prisoners
whose
convictions
became
final
prior
to
the
date
of
mapp
versus
ohio.
judge
reeves
speaking
for
divided
circuit
hailed
that
mapp
would
be
applied
prospectively
and
that
the
right
not
to
be
convicted
on
unconstitutionally
seized
evidence
would
not
be
accorded
to
victor
linkletter
because
his
conviction
became
final
prior
to
the
date
of
this
court's
decision
in
mapp.
the
opinion
below
was
based
perhaps
on
three
premises.
first
that
the
purpose
of
the
mapp
decision
is
deterrence
and
deterrence
of
illegal
police
action
and
this
purpose
can
only
be
served
or
is
mostly
served
by
a
prospective
application
of
mapp.
the
second
premises
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
was
that
orderly
judicial
administration
requires
a
prospective
as
opposed
to
retrospective
application.
and
the
third
premise
is
that
perhaps
mr.
linkletter
and
other
prisoners
who
have
been
convicted
on
illegal
seized
evidence
are
in
fact
guilty
and
that
the
issue
of
fairness
of
the
trial,
that
is
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
his
innocence
is
not
before
the
court
and
if
this
rule
or
constitutional
right
announced
in
mapp
should
be
given
some
sort
of
special
treatment.
now,
we
think
that
the
opinion
below
is
wrong
on
all
three
of
these
basic
premises.
the
circuits
as
this
court
knows
are
split
now
4
to
2,
4
holding
that
mapp
versus
ohio
should
be
fully
retroactive,
i
mean
sorry,
prospective
application
and
two
holding
that
the
mapp
rule
should
be
given
retrospective
application
to
all
prisoners.
we
think
that
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
are
some
refinements,
yes
sir.
basically
the
issues
have
been
of
cut
and
dry
window
i
think
as
decided
by
perhaps
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
court
has
drawn
one
refinement
by
affording
mapp
to
cases
that
had
not
been
finally
decided
by
occurrence
in
stoner
and
fay
decisions
i
believe
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir
that's
right,
procuring
the
(inaudible).
we
think
that
the
fundamental
personal
right
not
to
be
convicted
on
unconstitutionally
seized
evidence
is
the
rule
of
mapp.
by
emphasizing
the
purpose
of
deterrence,
the
fifth
circuit
has
obliterated
the
rule
itself.
now,
we
concede
that
deterrence
is
perhaps
a
purpose
or
is
a
purpose.
this
court
in
mapp
state
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
or
to
compel
respect
for
the
constitutional
guarantee
in
the
only
effective
available
way
by
removing
the
(inaudible)
to
disregard
it
as
a
quote
from
the
elkins
decision,
but
this
is
not
the
sole
and
exclusive
purpose
of
mapp.
we
submit
that
the
rule
of
mapp
or
the
purposes
of
mapp,
other
purposes
are
that
this
right
not
to
be
unconstitutionally
convicted
or
convicted
on
unconstitutional
evidence
is
reserved
to
all
persons.
this
court
stated
that
it
is
reserved
to
all
persons
as
a
specific
guarantee
and
that
this
right
should
be
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
i
think.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
justice
i've
would
hate
to
–
no
sir
i
don't
think
so
let
me
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
the
seizures
and
searches
in
the
mapp
case
and
in
the
linkletter
case
were
items
which
were
fully
--
the
seizures
were
plenary.
evidence
was
seized
which
was
totally
unrelated
to
the
original
search.
if
there
had
been
a
constitutional
seizure
there
would
not
have
been
a
prosecution.
this
right
goes
to
the
basis
of
the
whole
case.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
the
evidence
in--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
oh!
it
were
the
keys
and
clothing
and
personal
paper
and
some
perhaps
contraband
property
involving
a
premises
not
related
to
the
one
in
which
he
was
under
surveillance.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
some
was
i
think--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
it
was
contended
to
be
stolen,
the
petitioner
has
never
admitted
it
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
some
of
it
was,
some
of
it
was
his
personal
papers,
some
notes,
key
rings,
shoes,
(inaudible)
torch,
various,
various
items.
he
was
arrested
originally
for
an
alleged
burglary
occurring
on
one
street.
he
was
charged
with
that
crime.
the
crime
was
dismissed,
the
charges
were
dismissed.
he
was
later,
three
weeks
later
charged
with
another
wholly
unrelated
crime
based
on
evidence
seized
and
we
think
that
this
goes
beyond
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
trial.
this
is
something
more
base
(inaudible).
the
same
is
true
in
ms.
mapp.
she
was
--
had
been
searched
by
--
for
some
policy
paper
maybe
and
they
found
some
lewd
literature.
it
was
an
instantly
illegal
search
and
she
was
convicted
of
possession
of
lewd
literature.
so
the
--
i
think
that
i
maybe
not
evading
the
question,
but
to
me
it
seems
like
that
the
guilt
or
innocence
argument
is
even
stronger
in
this
case.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
but
the
fact
of
guilt
or
innocence
i
think
should
not
enter
into
the
decision
of
retrospective
versus
prospective
application.
to
quote
other
purposes
of
mapp
was
that
saying
was
that
this
right
is
reserved
to
all
persons
having
as
a
specific
guarantee.
the
court
stated
that
this
right
if
not
–
this
court
would
not
allow
this
right
to
stand
in
marked
contrast
to
other
rights,
declared
as
basic
to
a
free
society.
and
i
think
that
perspective
limitation
would
make
this
right
stand
in
mapp
contrast.
it
would
isolated
from
the
rights
set
forth
in
gideon
decision,
the
griffin
and
jackson
versus
denno.
these
decisions
have
been
applied
retroactive
by
this
court.
we
think
that
perspective
limitation
of
mapp
would
obliterate
the
rule
of
the
right
of
mapp
by
removing
from
victor
linkletter
this
right.
it
will
make
it
stand
in
marked
contrast.
i
think
we
mentioned
that
--
i
had
mentioned
in
the
brief
the
utility
or
perhaps
irony
of
arguing
what
this
court
meant
in
mapp
versus
ohio,
what
we
think
that
perhaps
the
intent
of
retroactive
application
was
set
forth
in
footnote
nine
of
the
mapp
decision
where
this
court
stated
that
there
are
some
who
say,
as
did
justice
cardozo,
the
undoubted
constitution
exclusionary
doctrine,
that
criminals
to
go
free
because
the
constable
has
blundered.
in
some
cases,
this
will
undoubtedly
be
the
result.
footnote
nine
stating
that,
“we
note,
moreover,
that
the
class
of
state
convictions
possibly
affected
by
this
decision
is
of
relatively
narrow
compass
when
compared
with
burns
versus
ohio,
griffin
versus
illinois,
and
herman
versus
claudy.
we
think
the
court
had
in
mind
in
this
footnote
nine,
the
fact
that
mapp
would
be
given
retroactive
application.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
those
cases,
the
same
contention
was
urged
and
later
proved
unbounded.
in
any
case,
further
delay
in
reaching
the
present
resort
would
have
no
effect
other
than
to
compound
the
difficulties.
certainly,
mr.
justice
harlan
had
retroactivity
in
mind
in
his
discernment,
dissenting
opinion
and
later
i
believe
in
the
(inaudible)
and
his
dissent
in
this
case,
he
mentioned
the
retroactive
implications
of
mapp
versus
ohio.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes,
and
i
think
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
i
think
it's
a
very
sound
approach.
i
think
professor
dan
miller
at
the
university
of
virginia
had
this
in
a
very
short
law
review
article
and
his
premises
were
based
on,
as
i
understand
on
the
--
in
part
on
the
present
effect
of
the
federal
of
the
habeas
corpus
rule
and
that
is
that
the
present
detention
must
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
that
the
person
must
be
presently
detained
and
that
the
present
detention
must
be
judged
on
the
present
constitutional
principles
and
i
think
it
is
very
sound
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
it.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
i
think
it
does
away
with
semantic
problem,
yes
sir.
he
has
another
article
that's
presently
in
gallic
form
at
the
university
of
virginia,
it's
a
leading
article
in
the
march
law
review,
i
have
been
privileged
to
read
it.
it's
an
article
by
mr.
tom
currier
entitled
time
and
changes
in
judge-made
law.
this
article
should
come
out,
the
law
review
should
come
out
in
about
three
weeks.
and
he
treats
the
whole
scope
of
retroactive
versus
prospective
application
in
civil
cases,
in
tort
contract
and
criminal
cases.
and
he
comes
to
the
same
conclusion
that
in
this,
in
mapp
versus
ohio,
the
fact
is
the
relevant
present
day
fact
is
command
retroactive
application,
that
the
quality
of
treatment
of
prisoners
far
overrides
any
reliance
that
the
state
of
louisiana
may
have
placed
on
wolf
and
this
is
a
very
excellent
article
and
i
hope
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
justice
clark,
i
would
think
that
the
law
officials
would
have
a
good
defense
on
the
fact
that
he
had
a
right
to
rely
at
that
time
on
the
person.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would,
i
have
missed
a
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
mr.
currier
would
distinguish
it,
because
the
fact
is,
in
that
situation,
we
waive
prospective
application.
you
can
see
that
the
reliance
factor
outweighs,
there
is
no
equality
of
treatment
problem
here.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
i
think
that,
yes
sir
i
think
it
would
be
an
illegal,
i
think
the
yes
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
if
i
am
follow
your
honor
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
if
there
is
any
way
to
get
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
i
may
have
to
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
i
have
some
doubt
whether
he
could.
the
fifth
circuit
put
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
disruption
at
the
orderly
administration
of
justice.
mr.
uviller
and
his
amicus
brief
dwells
at
length
on
the
wholesale
release
of
all
these
prisoners.
the
first
of
countless
past
cases
and
opening
a
thousands
of
past
cases
for
serving
under
this
new
right
or
scrutiny
under
this
new
right,
we
think
this
is
purely
speculative.
this
court
has
passed
on
this
opening
of
prison
gate
argument
in
the
gideon
case
and
i
think
again
it
answered
it
in
mapp.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
have
only
been
23
reported
decisions
in
three-and-a-half
years
since
mapp.
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
indicative
of
the
wholesale
release
of
the
number,
but
i
doubt
that
many
prisoners
are
waiting
filing
their
habeas
corpus
petitions
on
this
court
to
rule
in
linkletter.
we
think
that
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
in
fact
it
must
yield
to
the
important
fact
of
judicial
integrity
as
advanced
by
this
court
in
mapp
in
that
the
equality
of
treatment
of
prisoners
is
--
cannot
better
serve
for
--
judicial
integrity
cannot
be
better
served
than
the
equality
of
this.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
justice
brennan,
as
i
recall
this
court
gave
a
warning
several
years
after
the
wolf
decision
in
the
urban
versus
california
that
this
decision
was
coming
and
then
later
in
1959,
it
gave
another
warning
in
elkins
case.
the
reliance
of
louisiana
on
--
i
don't
think
is
a
very
important
factor.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
the
state
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
that
the
use
of
evidence
was
with
knowledge
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
this
removes
some
dignity
in
the
state's
position.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
well
i
submit
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
wolf
and
decisions
following
wolf
gave
the
states
ample
time
to
move
and
this
was
the
red
flag
that
was
waved
several
times
and
louisiana
never
moved.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
1959.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
no
irvine
was
in
1954,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
right
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
perhaps
it
is.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir
that
observation
has
been
made.
now
two
small,
not
small,
but
two
other
points
i
wish
to
make
briefly
is
that
if
this
court
should
hold
mapp
to
be
held
prospectively,
we
think
that
decision
would
not
be
right.
i
think
the
linkletter
case
should
be
reversed
because
his,
seizures
in
his
case
were
after
the
seizures
in
the
mapp
case.
he
has
some
factors
that
interrelate
with
mapp.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
had
been
a
little
more
tardy
in
its
judicial
business
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir
and
then
in
his
case
the
accident
time
was
the
deciding
factor
and
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
habeas
corpus
relief
under
a
prospective
holding
since
i
think
the
prospective
holding
you
like
to
cut
off
all
relevant
things.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir
because
and
my
client's
interest
depends
upon
the
workload
of
the
state
court
to
knock
it.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir,
no
sir.
it
could
have
--
the
louisiana
supreme
court
could
have
--
if
it
had
been
like
the
alabama
supreme
court
it
wouldn't
yet
decide
the
problem,
excuse
me.
it
might
have
been
two
or
three
years
late.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir
and
decide
it.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir
immediately
after
the
mapp
decision,
no
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
was
no
--
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
justice
clark,
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
says
that
there
was
--
that
there
were
objections
made
at
that
trial.
frankly,
i
could
not
find
any
specific
constitutional
objections
in
the
record.
there
were
objections
made
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence,
but
they
were
made
primarily
on
the
grounds
other
than
the
fourth
amendment
grounds.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
just
a
few
comments
your
honor.
mr.
uviller
comes
in
and
says
that
we
are
not
contending
that
we
are
going
to
open
the
--
this
decision
retroactively
is
going
to
open
the
jail
house
doors,
but
in
the
same
breath
he
says
the
courts
will
drown
under
the
workload
on
flood
of
litigation.
i
think
that
this
is
an
attack
upon
the
mapp
decision
itself,
not
upon
the
retroactive
application
effect.
i
think
that
this
has
been
asked
by
this
court
in
the
gideon
case,
it's
a
speculative
argument
and
is
one
that
there
is
any
legal
writers
on
one
side
as
is
there
are
on
the
other.
but
i
will
point
out
this
to
the
court,
it
is
simply
impressive
to
me
that
our
many
states
in
which
the
retroactivity
of
mapp
has
not
be
been
decided
and
there
are
several
circuits.
they
are
now
enough
cases
to
get
–
and
i
think
that
this
as
valid
as
mr.
uviller's
opening
the
door
arguments.
the
second
point
he
makes
is
there
is
no
unfairness
in
the
trail
based
on
illegalacies
tangible
evidence
and
again
i
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
trail
would
never
have
occurred
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it
was
a
legal
search
because
the
evidence
seized
could
not
be
seized
under
the
search
that
was
made
against
mr.
linkletter,
assuming
a
search
warrant.
this
guilt
or
innocence
argument,
the
fairness
of
the
trial
argument
has
been
passed
by
this
court
in
coerced
confession
cases.
it
has
been
held
as
an
immaterial
consideration
in
rogers
versus
richmond
and
hayes
versus
washington
case
and
i
could
not
see
mapp
personally
as
an
academic
principle,
but
only
as
personal
constitutional
right
which
this
court
has
said
should
be
applied
to
all
individuals.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
euel
a.
screws,
jr.
yes.
