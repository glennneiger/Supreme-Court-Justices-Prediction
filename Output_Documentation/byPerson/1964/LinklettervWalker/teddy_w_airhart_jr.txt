mr.
teddy
w.
airhart,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
a
trial
which
has
been
final
after
and
later
a
decision
rendered,
reversing
a
prior
case
upon
which
was
the
basis
of
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court
whether
or
not
that
later
decision
is
to
be
applied
retroactively,
namely
the
mapp
case.
the
lower
court
held
--
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
mapp
case
is
to
be
applied
only
prospectively.
the
court
there
set
forth
a
rule
which
is
respectfully
urged
by
the
state
of
louisiana
to
this
court
and
that
is
when
determining
whether
or
not
a
new
rule
of
law
which
previously
overruled
a
decision
on
the
same
point,
then
we
would
look
to
three
points
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
new
rule
would
be
retroactive
or
be
given
retroactive
effect.
the
first
being
to
attempt
to
identify
the
purpose
for
the
new
rule.
the
second
is
to
determine
the
balance
of
the
purpose
and
to
be
sure
--
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule
and
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
purpose
would
be
promoted.
prior
to
the
mapp
decision
this
court
recognized
the
right
to
be
free
from
illegal
search
and
seizure.
in
the
wolf
case
this
was
so
held,
but
at
that
time,
the
evidence
that
was
to
be
introduced
by
the
--
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
if
obtained
illegally,
would
not
be
excluded.
the
mapp
case
now
recognizes
the
same
rule
that
was
set
forth
in
weeks
which
is
applicable
to
the
federal
court
in
that
evidence
which
is
illegally
obtained
would
be
excluded
in
state
court
proceedings.
the
position
was
set
forth
by
the
state
in
its
brief
that
the
purpose
for
the
mapp
decision
is
to
give
purpose
to
the
right
to
be
free
from
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
this
right
prior
to
mapp
was
to
be
secured
in
other
type
of
proceeding.
i
assume
at
the
time
that
civil
proceedings
could
be
brought
against
the
officers
who
then
made
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
but
at
the
time
of
the
mapp
decision,
this
court
having
recognized
that
right
gave
impetus
to
that
right
of
freedom
from
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
by
barring
the
use
of
this
evidence
in
the
state
court.
the
primary
contention
or
one
of
the
primary
contentions
of
the
petitioner
is
that
his
act
or
his
right
to
be
secure
from
unlawful
search
and
seizure
occurred
at
a
time
which
was
after
the
illegal
search
in
mapp.
mr.
teddy
w.
airhart,
jr.
yes
sir,
those
are
correct.
i
think
that
it
is
well
to
define
what
the
is
the
state's
position
on
retro-activity.
the
question
would
have
to
be
determined
in
order
to
say
whether
or
not
this
court
is
applying
it
retroactively.
any
case
that
is
final
as
of
the
date
that
the
mapp
case
was
decided
by
this
honorable
court,
would
be
one
which
we
would
have
to
say
would
be
retroactive
if
so
applied.
this
is
a
case
which
is
being
attacked,
a
final
court
decision
which
was
valid
at
the
time
of
the
trail
is
being
attacked
collaterally
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
in
as
much
as
the
case
was
totally
finalized
at
the
time
that
mapp
decision
was
offered
by
this
court
or
held
by
this
court,
linkletter
had
completely
adjudicated
his
question.
now
the
question
is
what
was
the
purpose
for
mapp.
mapp
is
to
be
given
prospective
application
in
order
that
there
will
be
a
deterrent
against
state
offices
from
violating
constitutional
rights.
the
purpose
for
this
deterrent
would
be
in
no
way
served
by
holding
mapp
retroactive.
i
am
quite
sure
that
all
of
the
courts,
i
know
that
the
state
of
louisiana
is
following
mapp
and
therefore
the
practice
which
the
court
sought
to
bring
to
a
conclusion
or
to
finalize
was
in
its
decision
format
to
hold
that
there
is
a
deterrent
to
further
stop
the
officers
from
this
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
have
relinquished
some
time
to
the
amicus
curiae
which
i
will
now
turn
over
to
him.
