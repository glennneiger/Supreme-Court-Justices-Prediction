mr.
justice
bernnan
if
that
was
so,
could
he
be
retried,
if
you
took
that
approach,
could
he
be
retried?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i'm
stating
a
professor
meadow's
notion
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
detention
after
mapp,
and
therefore,
the
warden
should
let
him
go
free.
mr.
justice
bernnan
that
was
a
constitutional
detention
initially,
after
mapp
it
is
now
an
unconstitutional
detention
and
i
am
just
asking
you,
could
he
be
retried
again?
mr.
justice
bernnan
suppose
the
state
had
all
the
evidence
in
the
world,
but
he
has
been
in
there
eight
or
nine
years,
statute
of
limitations
have
long
since
gone.
could
you
retry
him?
mr.
justice
bernnan
yeah,
but
that
argument
i
suppose
under
wolf
no
absence
of
judicial
integrity
on
part
of
the
state
courts
relying
on
it,
was
there,
in
admitting
the
evidence?
i
doubt
the
fact
that
mapp
would
now
make
future
participation
perhaps
in
different
case,
that
changes
the
fact.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
no
i'm
just
going
to
the
argument.
you
say
that
this
is
involved
here
as
you
thought
there
was
in
elkins,
an
element
of
judicial
integrity,
the
participation
of
the
courts
in
what's
an
unconstitutional
act
in
essence
i
suppose
is
what's
involved
in
the
use
of
evidence
which
secured
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
yet
as
long
as
wolf
was
on
the
books
can
the
state
courts
be
suspect
for
admitting
that
evidence
when
wolf
said
that
they
might
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
where
they
in
any
way
partners
in
any
unconstitutional
act
in
using
that
evidence
actually?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
know,
but
this
court
had
said
in
wolf
that
was
perfectly
permissible
and
that
conviction
based
upon
the
use
of
that
evidence
was
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
year
what
that
about,
1950?
mr.
justice
bernnan
1959,
well
what
about
in
1949?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
what
about
between
1949
and
1954,
that's
five
years?
when
this
forecast
of
what
was
coming
up.
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
mean,
after
the
mapp
seizures,
but
before
the
mapp
decision?
mr.
justice
bernnan
intervening
the
mapp
seizure
and
the
mapp
decision?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
see,
is
this
an
argument
that
if
in
mapp
as
we
did,
we
held
that
mapp's
conviction
had
to
be
reversed
by
reason
of
a
seizure
which
preceded
this
seizure.
your
point
is
that
we
ought
not
to,
no
matter
what
we
do
about
prospective
or
retroactive,
that
at
least
we
ought
not
to
deny
mapp
to
those
whose
seizures
occurred
after
mapp
seizure,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
your
case
might
have
been
here
first?
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
are
these
state
rights,
the
mapp
search
was
may
23,
1957
and
the
illegal
search
in
this
case
august
24,
1958,
what
a
year-and-an-half
later.
is
that
right,
i
see
those
states
in
the
(inaudible).
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
hope
before
you
finish,
i
know
from
your
brief
what
your
position
is.
how
do
you
justify
applying
that
position
to
a
search
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
mapp
search
from
which
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
that
was
equally
true
in
august
20,
19
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
your
argument,
but
don't
take
any
more
time.
mr.
justice
bernnan
suppose
the,
suppose
the
search
was
of
dimension
of
local,
what
would
new
york
do
with
that?
mr.
justice
bernnan
are
you
making
this
distinction
now
between
so
called
evidence
and
so
called
contraband
or
are
you
making
a
further
distinction
between
testimonial
evidence
and
tangible?
mr.
justice
bernnan
yeah.
mr.
justice
bernnan
there
is
a
void
against
you
on
that.
you
have
to
avoid
[inaudible]
with
documents
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
time
served
or
sentence.
