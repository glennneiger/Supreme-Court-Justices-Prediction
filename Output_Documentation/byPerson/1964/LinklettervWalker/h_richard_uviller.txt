mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear,
i
have
the
honor
to
appear
before
this
court
representing
the
national
district
attorneys
association
as
a
friend
of
the
court,
because
of
the
overwhelming
nationwide
concern
with
the
issue
which
is
being
litigated
here
today.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
date
of
the
map
search
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
brennan
is
perhaps
the
least
significant
date
in
the
entire
transaction.
there
was
nothing
about
that
date
to
put
of
notice
any
police
officers
anywhere
in
the
country
and
presumably
police
offices
in
those
states
which
at
that
time
were
over
half
i
believe
the
jurisdictions
of
the
country,
police
officers
in
those
states
proceeded
to
rely
upon
wolf
and
the
common
law
and
the
laws
of
their
own
states,
which
permitted
them
to
introduce
such
evidence.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
precisely.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
precisely.
it
seems
to
us
a
necessary
and
logical
colliery
to
the
theory
of
a
living
and
viable
constitution,
that
our
trial
courts
should
not
be
strangled
with
the
immense
task
of
attempting
to
remake,
to
rewrite
their
own
history
where
the
truth
seeking
process
of
the
trial
itself
was
not
marred
by
unfairness.
judgment
should
be
final
and
result
should
be
secured.
i
don't
think
that
the
price
of
progress
and
the
events
of
our
understanding
of
the
essential
human
liberties
embraced
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
the
systematic
destruction
of
the
conscientious
work
of
courts
applying
standards
which
at
the
time
they
were
applied
were
deemed
equally
reasonable
by
men
of
goodwill.
it
seems
to
me
that
neither
mapp
nor
it's
progeny
were
cases
dealing
with
fair
trial.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
essential
distinction
between
those
cases
which
effect
the
validity
and
reliability
of
the
truth
seeking
process
itself.
those
cases
involving
representation
by
counsel
at
trails,
such
as
the
gideon
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
alluded
to.
those
cases
involving
confessions
which
are
traditionally
unreliable
evidence
and
always
have
deemed
unreliable
evidence.
and
those
decisions
the
focus
of
which
is
outside
the
courtroom,
is
outside
the
truth
seeking
process
which
is
embraced
by
the
concept
of
due
process.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mapp
case
did
not
create
a
new
right
i
think
perhaps
it
is
well
for
us
to
pause
and
consider
what
the
right
is
that
we
are
addressing
ourselves
to.
is
the
right
embraced
by
the
fourth
amendment,
the
right
to
retroactivity?
is
it
the
right
to
exclusion
of
evidence
and
evidence
proposition?
i
submit
that
it
is
not.
i
submit
that
the
right
announced
by
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
right
which
was
applied
to
the
states
by
wolf
against
colorado.
i
submit
that,
that
right
since
wolf
has
been
binding
upon
state
officers
and
has
been
a
right
of
the
citizens
of
the
various
states.
and
that
is
the
right
of
all
citizens,
not
just
defendants
on
trial,
but
of
all
citizens
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
unreasonable
encroachments
by
state
offices
into
their
privacy.
now
that
is
a
right
which
is
a
non
court
room
right.
that
is
a
right
which
is
violated
before
the
judicial
machinery
that
comes
into
play,
and
that
is
a
right
it
seems
to
me,
the
violation
of
which
cannot
be
remedied
by
retroactive
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
exclusionary
rule
was
adopted
we
submit
as
an
enforcement
device
to
secure
this
primary
constitutional
right.
true
it
is
itself
a
constitutional
dimension,
but
it
is
not
a
right
derived
directly
and
independently
from
the
constitution.
it
seems
to
me
as
i
read
wolf
and
mapp
that
is
court
after
announcing
the
applicability
of
the
primary
right
to
privacy
to
the
states,
allowed
the
states
an
opportunity,
very
practically
to
develop
if
they
could
means
for
securing
this
right
to
the
citizens
of
their
jurisdiction.
it
was
allowed
in
wolf
that
this
might
be
possible
to
do
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
new
york
is
a
part
of
the
rule
as
this
court
has.
new
york
is
applying
the
rule
i
should
say
of
intermediate
retroactivity,
that
is
to
say
the
benefits
of
the
mapp
decision
belong
to
all
defendants
who's
cases
are
decided
in
the
normal
course
of
appeal
with
the
point
preserved
by
objection
or
by
some
other
means
of
raising
the
issue
and
presenting
it
to
the
trial
court.
in
other
words
those
tried
before
mapp
whose
appeals
are
decided
after
mapp
get
the
benefit
of
the
rule.
however
where
the
normal
appellate
process
has
been
exhausted,
then
a
state
prisoner
who's
only
recourse
is
through
the
federal
court
is
denied
that
right
by
the
second
circuit
opinion
reviewed
in
the
companion
case
today.
so
that
i
think
retroactivity
is
itself
a
matter
of
degree.
it
seems
to
me
that
retroactivity
itself
is
not
at
all
enough
in
proposition.
even
in
jackson
against
denno
there
was
a
modified
sort
of
retroactivity
imposed
in
as
much
as
the
judgment
itself
was
allowed
to
remain
assuming
that
a
search
for
prejudice,
post-judgment
search
for
prejudice
turned
out
to
be
negative.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
assume
that
the
rowkin
(ph)
case
stands
for
a
good
law
in
new
york
state
courts
as
well
although
i
can't
cite
a
case
for
that
proposition.
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
rowkin
(ph)
case
was
a
case
of
outrage,
a
case
of
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
without
reference
to
any
of
the
first
ten,
a
case
which
where
the
procedure
was
so
brutal
and
shocking
that
something
had
to
be
done
and
remedies
were
provided.
i
fail
to
---
i
am
not
able
to
harmonize
that
decision
with
those
decisions
involved
in
the
fourth,
fifth,
even
fifth
or
sixth
amendments.
i
think
it
stands
by
itself
and
i
assume
it
would
be
applied
in
new
york
by
some
sort
of
commensurate
relief.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i,
yes,
well,
new
york
has
in
its
own
constitution
the
equivalent
of
the
fifth
amendment.
new
york
has
been
applying
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
is
perhaps
even
broader
than
the
federal
rights
for
many,
many
years.
the
effect
of
malloy
(ph)
has
not
been
disturbing
in
new
york.
i
think
that
there
is
some
problem
with
fifth
amendment
cases
as
far
as
exclusion
is
concerned.
i
would
distinguish
between
pure
fourth
amendment
cases,
where
the
evidence
is
a
tangible
object,
something
which
is
not
in
anyway
affected,
inherently
not
affected
by
the
manner
of
its
accusation.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
can
conceive
under
the
mapp
case
itself,
mr
justice
clark,
i
can
easily
conceive
of
many,
many
situations
i
think
several
of
which
have
arisen
already
since
mapp
in
which
there
is
an
inter-relationship
between
the
fifth
and
the
fourth.
i
think
that
inter-relationship
occurs
where
objects
are
obtained
as
a
result
of
coercively
obtained
information,
where
there
is
a
seizure
which
in
turn
precipitates
a
confession
or
an
inculpatory
declaration
very
frequently
investigated
techniques
of
themselves
are
intermixed.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
am
making
the
distinction
between
testimonial
evidence
and
tangible
evidence
justice
brennan.
i
have
not
prepared
to
argue
today
though
i
assume
we
will
some
day,
the
difference
between
mere
evidence
and
contraband.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
to
me
a
letter
is
a
tangible
object,
justice
white
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
realize
the
difficulties
to
avoid
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
think
for
these
purposes
and
now
we
have
to
refer
to
the
object
of
retroactivity,
that's
the
limited
question
before
us
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
context
there
might
be
very
realistic
distinction
growing
between
those
object
which
are
obtained
in
a
manner
which
might
affect
their
reliability
as
a
truth
seeking
piece
of
evidence
relating
to
the
question
of
guilt.
now,
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
unfairness.
there
was
no
unfairness
inherent
or
otherwise
essential
or
otherwise
in
a
trial
at
which
a
defendant
was
convicted
by
the
use
of
tangible
evidence,
which
was
obtained
without
warrant.
it's
entirely
possible
that
had
that
search
occurred
subsequent
to
mapp,
there
might
have
been
a
warrant,
there
might
easily
have
been
evidence
to
procure
the
warrant
had
the
police
officers
knew
--
known
that
they
could
have
done
so
or
that
they
were
obliged
to
do
so.
i
suggest
the
evidence
itself
would
have
been
the
same.
indeed,
there
are
many
very
civilized
jurisdictions
in
the
world
where
evidence
is
still
admissible
if
it
is
prohibitive
and
bears
on
the
issue
of
guilt
regardless
of
the
manner
of
its
acquisition.
i
assume
that
there
are
enforcement
devices
other
than
exclusion,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
itself
a
new
right,
a
right
commensurate
with
the
right
to
privacy
itself.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
do
you
suggest
justice
black
that
one
of
those
is
the
right
to
a
fair
trial?
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
used
it
only
as
a
shorthand
device,
justice
black.
i
am
perfectly
cognitive
of
the
fact
that
the
amendment
is
far
broader,
but
i
meant
to
merely
make
the
distinction
between
the
evidentiary
aspect
and
the
intrusion
aspect.
one
occurring
outside
the
trial
process
itself
and
the
other
within
the
trial.
indeed,
it's
interesting
i
think
that
in
the
companion
case,
the
angelet
case,
the
court
below
explicitly
found
that
while
finding
if
there
was
an
unlawful
search
which
we
do
not
concede,
but
that
was
the
finding
below.
they
found
as
well
that
there
was
no
unfairness
whatsoever
in
the
trial
on
which
this
evidence
was
admitted.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
world
of
changing
violence
where
time
itself
has
an
extremely
important
affect
upon
the
law
and
the
lives
of
men
that
we
cannot
encumber
our
trial
courts
with
re-litigation.
now,
one
of
the
practical
facts
of
life
is
that
there
is
a
(inaudible)
and
sadly
a
limited
number
of
court
hours
at
the
disposal
of
the
various
state
jurisdictions.
it
is
no
secret
that
the
court
calenders
and
dockets
of
every
court
in
the
country
are
crowded
with
defendants,
some
of
whom
are
unable
to
make
bail,
who
are
awaiting
trial
and
must
await
trial
until
there
is
a
free
hour
in
court.
counsel,
the
demands
upon
counsels
time
to
represent
indigent
clients
are
very,
very
great
and
the
courts
to
have
wait
for
the
counsel
to
be
free
to
try
a
case.
these
are
some
of
the
hard
facts
of
life
and
i
suggest
that
if
the
time
of
the
courts
is
to
be
consumed
with
the
re-litigation
of
cases
which
were
decided
fairly
according
to
standards
which
were
then
controlled,
then
i
suggest
that
the
court
will
indeed
drown
under
the
workload
and
i
do
not
say
and
we
do
not
urge
here
that
there
will
be
a
jail
delivery.
we
are
not
here
to
raise
any
specter
of
criminals
going
free
and
walking
the
streets.
our
concern
here
is
for
the
administration
of
justice
itself
in
the
courts.
our
concern
here
is
what
the
proper
business
of
a
trial
court
should
be,
should
it
be
the
current
work,
the
litigation
of
those
who
have
not
yet
been
tried
in
their
cases
or
should
it
be
an
attempt
to
rewrite,
to
remake
of
the
history
of
the
past.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
justice
harlan,
there
are
not.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
judge
nathan
sobel
did
do
some
sort
of
a
non-scientific
exploration.
i
might
say
that
if
i
receive
permission
of
the
court,
we
are
still
in
the
process
of
developing
figures
from
the
state
court
of
parole
of
new
york,
which
maybe
able
to
give
us
some
sort
of
breakdown
as
to
how
many
prisoners
in
jail
are
on
parole,
it
might
be
effective.
it
won't
be
scientific,
but
it
will
be
probably
better
that
we
have
been
able
to
submit
so
far
and
if
we
have
10
days,
i
can
certainly
submit
that
in
a
supplementary
brief.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
thank
you.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
depends
on
partly
on
how
far
back
we
go
because
the
number
of
the
states
have
recently
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
know
how
many
states
would
be
effected
i
--.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
we
will
certainly
be
included,
i
will
say
this.
i
think
the
federal
court
will
be
affected
and
i
think
that
we
must
bear
in
mind,
that
not
only
those
people
who
are
still
in
jail
or
on
parole
and
therefore
eligible
for
federal
writs
would
be
effected.
this
decision
of
retroactivity
here
would
affect
everybody
who
has
already
been
and
will
in
the
future
be
convicted
as
a
multiple
offender.
and
as
such,
it
will
reach
back
into
the
past
or
beyond
the
expiration
of
sentences
that
are
still
being
served.
i
would
also
say
that
another
deleterious
effect
will
be
that
those
who
have
received
the
longest
sentences
will
be
those
who
receive
the
benefit
of
retroactivity.
those
who
are
repeaters
will
receive
the
benefit
of
retroactivity,
while
those
on
the
present
standards
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
who
were
less
blameworthy
will
have
a
worse
deal.
i
think
that
there
are
inevitable
inequities
in
any
development
of
law
or
any
development.
when
you
live,
in
what
century,
in
what
year
you
commit
the
acts
you
do,
cannot
fail
to
have
an
effect
on
your
life
and
i
dare
say
that
maybe
beyond
the
power
of
the
score
of
the
constitution
itself
or
to
correct
or
such
inevitable
inequities
in
the
dynamic
and
developing
system
of
law.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
justice
harlan,
when
i
--
i
do
not.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
once
the
rid
of
habeas
corpus
is
opened
for
this
purpose
that
opens
the
flood
gates
of
litigation
whether
it's
in
the
federal
courts
or
in
the
state
courts.
i
do
not
think
that
the
solution
of
modified
retroactivity
which
was
adopted
in
jackson
against
denno,
will
be
helpful
even
because
again,
it's
not
the
burden
of
a
new
trial,
it's
not
the
not
the
fear
that
we
won't
be
able
to
convict
them
because
we
don't
have
the
evidence
anymore.
we
are
not
interested
in
that.
what
we
are
interested
in
is
the
number
of
courtroom
hours
that
will
be
consumed
to
litigate
the
issue,
whether
that
be
on
a
special
hearing
of
the
type
that
jackson
and
denno
advised
or
whether
it
be
by
outright
reversal
of
a
conviction
and
an
utterly
and
completely
neutral.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
justice
black
with
all
due
respect
that
that
is
not
the
issue,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
constitutional
right
that
he
was
deprived
of
is
why
he
is
in
jail.
i
think
that
he
is
in
jail
because
of
the
–-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
the
primary
constitutional
right
was
the
right
to
be
tried
without
the
use
of
this
evidence.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
that
is
the
constitutional
right,
then
we
have
a
man
who
is
in
jail
in
deprivation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that,
that
is
the
factor
which
should
affect
the
determination
of
the
court.
they
work
–
(inaudible).
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
have
a
difficulty
answering
the
question
justice
black,
only
because
i
have
difficulty
in
conceding
the
major
premise.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
man
was
convicted
by
standards
which
were
entirely
fair
and
proper
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
then
because
we
have
changed
our
notions
as
to
a
proper
enforcement
technique
or
even
if
we
have
changed
our
notions
as
to
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
and
its
dimensions
that
we
do
not
say,
therefore
that
he
is
in
jail
on
an
unconstitutional
conviction.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
–-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
the
shock
is
a
factor
in
the
dimensions
of
due
process
yes,
but
i
don't
suggest
for
a
moment
that
this
court
decides
the
dimensions
of
the
constitution
on
such
standards.
i
do
believe
that
our
consciences
as
civilized
people
as
we
progress
through
history
do
develop
and
that
our
ideas
become
refined.
now,
i
am
saying
in
a
way
that
they
change
and
the
change
is
a
fact
of
life.
i
do
not
think,
however,
that
a
change
necessarily
undoes
that
which
was
deemed
to
be
proper
and
constitutional
in
a
previous
age
by
a
court
of
equally
goodwill
at
that
time.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
sir,
i
am
sir.
in
that
respect,
i
would
subscribe
to
the
theory
of
both
courts
below
the
fifth
and
second
circuits
and
saying
that
we
must
be
legal
realists
today,
that
we
must
acknowledge
the
change
in
our
interpretation
of
our
constitution
and
we
cannot
accept
the
proposition
that
this
court
will
sit
and
say
that
its
predecessor
was
wrong
on
the
interpretation
of
immutable
law.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
you
understand
me,
i
think
justice
black
to
say
that
this
court
should
announce
what
we
today
and
what
this
court
today
feels
is
right
and
that
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
feels
is
just,
which
i
mean
the
constitutional.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
find
out
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
justice
black
and
i
dare
say
that
this
court
has
refrained
in
the
past
from
adopting
the
theory
that
any
overruling
of
a
previous
decision
on
constitutional
grounds
necessarily
carries
back
to
the
beginning
of
history.
what
disturbs
is
here
essentially
i
think,
justice
black
if
i
may
just
answer
the
question
at
a
little
bit
greater
length,
i
think
that
what
disturbs
us
here
is
the
fact
that
prisoners
carry
with
them
for
years
to
come
the
effects
of
the
adjudication
upon
them
and
consequently,
they
live
into
different
years.
if
the
judgment
were
final
and
there
were
no
effects
of
itself
in
future
years,
i
don't
think
that
we
would
seriously
trouble
ourselves
with
whether
or
not
the
person
who
has
been
convicted
ten
or
twenty
years
ago
should
have
that
conviction
overturned
as
a
matter
of
academic
interest.
it
is
only
because
of
the
fact
that
that's
certain
stretches
out
into
a
era
in
which
our
notions
of
fairness
and
due
process
have
changed
and
developed
and
improved.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
take
this
blackstonian
view
about
the
development
of
law
would
be
a
unrealistic
and
impractical
view.
i
think
that
the
–-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir
i
–-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
justice
blackstone
in
discussing
the
rule
of
stare
decious
did
i
believe
espoused
there
that
the
court
does
not
make
law,
but
merely
discovers
and
finds
it.
and
if
that
involves
informing
us
as
to
the
errors
of
judgment
of
the
predecessor
courts,
then
that
is
simply
an
announcement
of
error
in
interpretation.
i
think
that
the
courts
below
were
proper
and
they
rejected
it
soundly,
this
theory
in
favor
of
that
which
justice
cardozo
has
stood
–-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
actually
where
–-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
it
might
be
possible
if
i
understand
you
correctly
justice
harlan.
i
dare
say
that
there
would
be
a
very
large
number
of
just
this
speculation
on
capital
cases
both
those
who
were
presently
waiting
execution
or
incarcerated
on
commutations
and
also
have
already
been
executed.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
we
will
attempt
to
do
it
probably
–-
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
and
that
i
think
reflects
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
in
answer
to
justice
black,
that
these
sentences
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
we
will
try
to
do
so.
you
see
it
does
involve
an
element
of
speculation
justice
harlan
because
we
never
really
do
know
what
particular
piece
of
evidence
might
have
been
subject
to
a
exclusion.
it's
easier
to
say
in
the
contraband
cases
than
it
is
in
cases
such
as
murder
cases,
particularly
–
but
we
will
try
to
do
so
with
supporting
documents
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
were
all
felonies,
my
guess
would
be
that
it
would
be
somewhere
around
five
to
seven
years.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
that's
sentence.
we
have
a
one-third
off
the
minimum
for
good
time,
which
means
a
five
year
sentence
is
what
something
like
three
years
and
a
few
months
of
actual
sentence.
i
should
think
it
would
be
about
that,
though
of
course
it
varies
by
–-
