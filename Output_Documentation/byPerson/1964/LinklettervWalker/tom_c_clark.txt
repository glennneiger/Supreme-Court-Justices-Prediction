justice
tom
c.
clark
in
fact,
mainly
during
the
last
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
fact,
when
reading
the
last
setup
on
footnote
nine,
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
as
he
has
pointed
out
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
have
you
read
another
article,
[inaudible]
retroactive,
retrospective
and
prospective
by
saying
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
some
persons
who
had
been
convicted,
what
he
claims
to
be
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
brought
a
civil
suit
against
the
option.
they
say
he
was
convicted
prior
to
the
time
of
mapp
at
the
time
when
wolf
was
in
the
force.
what
do
you
think
would
be
the
merit
to
that
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
it
wouldn't
be
retroactive
in
support
of
that
case.
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
the
other?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
do
you
think
that
the
fact,
that
prior
to
mapp,
a
man
couldn't
bring
a
habeas
corpus
because
the
warden
could
come
in
and
say,
well
i'm
depending
on
wolf,
but
after
mapp,
he
couldn't
depend
on
wolf,
could
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
would
be
an
illegal
detention,
you
think
after
mapp?
justice
tom
c.
clark
because
i
just
--
in
irvine
i
really
can't
understand.
i
mean
[inaudible],
all
i
said
was
if
i
could
by,
i
wouldn't
know
where
to
look.
i
didn't
think
it
was
any
bigger
than
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
a
two-edged
sword
looks
like
to
me
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes
it
would.
they
depended
on
all
these
years
from
1949
to
1961
and
the
court
is
[inaudible]
let
these
people
out.
it
appears
to
me
also
in
mapp
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
that
case
the
filed
petition
here
--
the
petition
filed
in
the
--
after
the
louisiana
direct
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
is
a
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
many
petitions
or
certiorari
filed
in
this
case
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
there
any
objection
made
at
the
trial
on
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
there
any
motion?
justice
tom
c.
clark
right.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
do
you
with
the
fifth,
that's
on
the
law?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
do
you
do
with
the
fifth
amendment
self
incrimination
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
i
meant
was
my
brother
black
[inaudible]
placed
reliance
on
fifth?
