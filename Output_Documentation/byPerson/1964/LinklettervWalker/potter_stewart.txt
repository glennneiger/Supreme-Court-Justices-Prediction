if
there
are
some,
there
are
some
refinements
on
those
two
broad
categories?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
some
of
the
--
is
question
whether
or
not
on
direct
appeal
or
on
the
collateral
attack
and
whether
or
not
the
actual
search
occurred
before
or
after
mapp,
the
trial
so
on,
but
there
have
been
refinements
drawn
by
some
of
the
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
without
any
real
discussion
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
fair
trial
as
such,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
contrasted
to
the
rule
of
gideon
against
wainwright
for
instance
because
there
is
no
question
that
this
evidence
is
relevant
material
i
believe
had
it
been,
had
it
been
obtained
properly
would
have
been
fairly
admissible
without
violating
his
right
to
a
fair
trial
in
any
way,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
then
tell
me
why
please?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
introduced
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
stolen
property,
was
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
don't
have
in
it
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
no
i
am
not
asking
to
admit
anything,
but
that
was
--
the
stuff
that
was
admitted
was
allegedly
stolen
property?
justice
potter
stewart
well
of
course
this
court
doesn't
sit
here
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
uviller
if
the
data
in
the
appendix
to
the
court's
opinion
in
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states
are
more
or
less
accurate,
this
would
have
a
real
impact
in
only
something
like
about
22
states,
is
that
right?
that
is
26
or
28
states,
at
least
26
apparently
have
had
an
exclusionary
rule
of
their
own
granting
that
the
standards
may
vary
a
little
bit
from
the
standards
which
we
now
say
are
applicable
the
federal
constitutional
standards.
if
those
data
are
accurate,
would
that
be
right
that
this
would
have
any
real
impact
and
only
something
less
than
(inaudible)
states?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
we
found
only
two
or
three
as
it
is
between
the
decision
in
between
the
â€“
between
the
wolf
decision
and
the
elkins
decision
and
there
had
been
a
few
more
between
weeks
and
wolf.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
might
be
included
and
what
you
are
going
to
say?
