mr.
stanford
shmukler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
forfeiture
of
an
automobile
which
was
seized
as
it
crossed
the
stateline
from
new
jersey
to
pennsylvania.
the
car
was
stopped.
the
driver
was
arrested
and
the
car
was
seized
as
was
375
bottles
of
liquor
contained
in
the
trunk
and
the
rear
seat
of
the
car.
these
bottles
of
liquor
were
legitimate
brand
name
bottles
of
liquor
which
did
not
contain
pennsylvania
state
license
tax
stamps.
the
lower
court
denied
the
petition
for
forfeiture,
concluding
that
there
had
been
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
that
there
had
been
no
probable
cause
for
stopping
the
car.
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
reversed,
concluding
that
the
state
does
and
should
have
the
right
to
stop
travelers
to
find
out
if
they
are
transporting
any
items
upon
which
a
tax
would
be
due.
and
they
concluded
without
actually
making
a
factual
finding
that
the
search
and
seizure
had
been
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
completely
invade
--
or
avoided
this
question
by
concluding
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
applicable
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding
which
it
concluded
was
not
a
criminal
proceeding.
less
than
four
years
ago,
this
court
in
mapp
versus
ohio
concluded
that
it
was
going
to
close
the
only
courtroom
door,
remaining
open
to
evidence
secured
by
official
lawlessness
in
flagrant
abuse
of
the
basic
right
of
privacy
reserved
to
all
persons
as
a
specific
guarantee
against
that
very
same
lawless
conduct.
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
apparently
finding
the
courtroom
doors
closed
is
apparently
trying
to
get
into
the
courtroom
windows.
here,
they
are
arguing
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
it
applies
only
in
criminal
cases.
i
believe
that
the
mapp
citation
--
quotation
from
mapp
does
not
so
restrict
the
rule.
the
first
question
here
to
be
decided
i
believe,
is
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
stopping
the
car,
arresting
the
driver
and
seizing
the
liquor
and
the
automobile
without
a
warrant.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
correct
justice
stewart.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
concluded
that
there
are
no
property
rights
in
contraband
and
that
therefore,
they
never
got
to
the
question
whether
there
was
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
it's
respectfully
submitted
however
that
this
car
is
not
itself
contraband
unless
and
until
it
has
been
proved
in
a
court
of
law
that
its
use
was
illegal.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
quite
right
sir.
i
--
both
questions
have
to
be
faced
and
i'm
willing
to
face
it
now.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
we
are
not
questioning
here,
items
which
are
per
se
contraband.
we
are
questioning
here
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
of
an
automobile
which
is
not
itself
contraband,
but
which
is
contraband
only
because
evidence
is
submitted
in
a
court
of
law
showing
that
it
was
used
illegally.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
per
se
contraband
like
narcotics,
counterfeit
plates
and
other
items
which
the
--
mere
possession
would
be
a
crime.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir,
the
pennsylvania
statute
provides
that
the
possession
of
unstamped
liquor
is
a
crime
and
that
the
liquor
itself
would
be
forfeit
as
could
the
vehicle
used
in
transportation.
i
am
not
going
to
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
well
justice
brennan,
in
this
case,
the
liquor
was
forfeit
without
a
--
an
answer
being
filed
to
the
petition
and
it
was
contraband
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes
sir.
and
i'm
trying
to
(voice
overlap)
avoid
the
question
for
this
reason
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
liquor
is
here
before
us
today
and
i
would
be
sorely
pressed
to
determine
whether
a
bottle
which
does
not
contain
a
tax
stamp
is
itself
contraband.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
arrive
at
that
decision
--
that
question
at
all.
if
this
were
moonshine
liquor,
there
might
be
a
different
question.
the
mere
fact
that
the
bottle
does
not
contain
a
tax
stamp,
under
the
statute
it
appears
to
be
sufficient
to
render
it
contraband
by
itself
and
i
would
say
that
it
appears
to
be
so.
whether
that
statute
as
so
applied
would
be
constitutional,
is
not
before
this
court
really,
because
in
this
case,
the
liquor
was
forfeit
without
an
answer
being
filed.
in
this
case
though,
we
submit
that
this
is
one
step
farther
removed
even
if
the
liquor
itself
were
contraband
and
could
be
forfeit
on
the
spot
without
a
judicial
determination,
we
submit
here
that
the
car
itself
does
not
fall
on
this
category
by
any
stretch
of
reasoning
because
the
only
way
the
car
can
become
contraband
is
when
its
use
has
been
proved
in
the
court
of
law.
and
here,
the
entire
evidence
relating
to
the
use
of
the
automobile
is
expressly
excluded
from
proof
in
the
court
of
law
by
the
mapp
case
if
we
are
correct
that
there
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
of
this
car
and
its
contents.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
well
sir,
jeffers
and
trupiano
were
not
forfeiture
proceedings.
the
only
way
in
which
this
issue
came
up
in
jeffers
and
trupiano
was
that
in
the
pish
--
petition
to
suppress
the
evidence,
apparently,
the
counsel
asked
for
the
return
of
the
items.
the
court
concluded
in
both
cases
that
since
they
were
contraband,
they
could
not
be
returned,
but
jeffers
and
trupiano
involved
one
instance
narcotics,
which
by
themselves
fall
into
a
different
category,
are
clearly
contraband
because
as
in
the
--
in
other
case,
i
believe
it
was
(inaudible),
the
court
had
said
that
these
narcotics
and
i
think
in
that
case,
heroin,
are
never
valid,
never
--
the
possession
of
narcotics
is
never
valid.
and
in
the
other
case,
it
was
white
--
white
whiskey
that,
it
was
moonshine
liquor
and
distilled,
distill
equipment
which
of
course
could
never
be
used
for
a
valid
purpose.
in
this
case,
however,
we
have
an
automobile
which
of
course
is
used
for
a
valid
purpose.
the
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
valid
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir,
on
the
statute
i
believe
there
would
be
no
question
because
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
right
sir.
in
this
case
justice
white,
it
was
strictly
the
evidence
which
we
complain,
cannot
be
admitted
in
the
courtroom
under
the
mapp
rule.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
well,
if
the
government
can
illegally
keep
the
--
i
mean,
can
keep
the
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
they
could
destroy
the
liquor
if
--
at
least,
that's
what
the
facts
in
this
case
far,
that
they
did
seize
and
it
was
not
contested
and
they
could
destroy
the
liquor
but
they
cannot
introduce
it
into
a
courtroom
to
prove
that
the
car
was
being
improperly
used.
if
however,
as
justice
white
has
suggested,
the
officers
had
observed
a
violation
of
law
and
had
observed
the
automobile
being
used
illegally
for
transportation
of
illegal
liquor,
this
would
be
a
different
question
because
there,
we
would
have
evidence,
proper
evidence
in
a
courtroom
showing
the
illegal
use
and
then
the
car
would
be
forfeitable.
i
don't
really
think
that
there
is
too
much
argument
left
in
this
court
that
the
search
and
seizure
here
were
valid.
i
think
the
beck
case
has
pretty
clearly
lay
that
question
to
rest
as
does
the
henry
case.
the
factual
background
behind
the
seizure
here
is
very
short.
it
appears
on
approximately
three
or
four
pages
of
this
transcript.
a
--
an
enforcement
officer
of
the
liquor
control
board
testified
that
he
observed
this
automobile
crossing
the
bridge
from
camden
into
philadelphia,
that
it
was
riding
low
in
the
rear.
he
admitted
that
there
was
no
other
violation
of
law
observed.
he
admitted
that
he
observed
nothing
wrong
with
the
car
other
than
it
was
riding
low
in
the
rear.
they
stopped
the
car,
they
placed
the
individual
under
arrest
and
searched
the
car.
the
lower
court,
the
fact-finding
court
here,
did
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
was
no
reasonable
search
and
seizure
and
that
the
--
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
stopping
the
car
whatsoever.
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
carroll
case
and
the
beck
case,
the
factual
findings
of
the
trial
court
must
be
given
great
difference.
furthermore,
there
were
no
appellate
findings
to
the
contrary
here.
the
only
finding
in
either
of
the
appellate
courts,
the
superior
or
the
supreme
court
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
for
a
stopping
of
the
--
and0
a
search
of
the
car
was
the
broad
statement
by
the
superior
court
that
under
the
circumstances,
they
opinioned
that
search
and
seizure
were
reasonable.
they
apparently
suggested
that
because
this
was
december
the
16th,
near
a
holiday
season,
they
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
automobiles
would
be
transporting
illegal
liquor
from
new
jersey
into
pennsylvania.
i
think
that
the
dissenting
opinions
in
that
court
lay
that
question
to
rest.
the
superior
court
majority
also
points
out
that
the
--
there
was
a
very
skimpy
record
here
made
in
the
trial
court
and
couldn't
tell
whether
the
officers
could
observe
the
back
of
the
car
or
whether
they
are
--
had
observed
a
misdemeanor
thing
committed
in
their
presence.
and
i
believe
again,
that
a
search
of
the
record,
an
independent
search
of
the
record
by
this
court
taking
only
the
uncontested
facts
will
show
clearly
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
its
conclusion
that
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
illegality.
the
government
did
not
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
car
had
been
used
illegally
or
that
there
was
any
probable
cause
for
stopping
the
car
at
that
time.
in
the
beck
case
of
course,
the
facts
were
even
stronger.
there,
they
had
a
police
picture
of
the
driver
of
the
car.
they
knew
that
he
had
a
record
and
they
had
some
information
about
his
activities.
in
this
case,
we
have
none
of
that
whatsoever.
we
have
no
prior
observation
of
this
car,
although
one
of
the
officers
testified
that
he
had
observed
some
other
late
model
black
plymouth
car
traveling.
it
was
not
this
car.
he
admitted
that
he
had
never
seen
this
car
before.
he
admitted
that
they
did
not
know
the
driver
of
the
car,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
no
reason
to
stop
the
car
except
mere
suspicion,
and
the
lower
court
so
found.
in
fact
your
honor,
if
we
are
correct
that
this
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
if
the
mapp
decision
is
taken
to
exclude
from
a
courtroom,
any
evidence
direct
or
circumstantial
arising
from
that
search
and
seizure,
then
we
would
be
forced
to
strike
from
the
record
here,
almost
all
of
pages
4,
5
and
6
in
which
the
officer
testified
to
what
he
observed
and
then
the
only
thing
left
in
the
record
would
be
the
bald
statement
that
a
car
was
traveling
from
new
jersey
to
philadelphia
and
that
it
was
stopped.
if
you
strike
from
the
record
all
observations
of
the
liquor
which
was
seized
after
the
stopping
of
the
car
and
the
arrest
of
the
driver,
then
that
is
all
that
is
left
and
this
leaves
us
a
picture
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
forfeiting
a
car
on
testimony
that
is
traveled
from
new
jersey
to
pennsylvania.
now
the
rationale
of
the
mapp
case,
the
reason
for
the
decision
in
the
mapp
case
according
to
this
court
appears
to
be
that
it
is
to
deter
official
governmental
lawlessness,
to
remove
the
incentive
for
governmental
violations
of
the
constitution.
to
allow
the
government
to
benefit
from
its
lawlessness
here
in
stopping
this
car
by
seizing
that
car
and
taking
the
car
for
its
own
benefit
is
to
leave
the
same
incentive
which
this
court
in
mapp
tried
to
remove.
true,
they're
not
using
the
car
in
evidence
against
the
driver.
they
are
not
using
the
liquor
in
evidence
against
the
driver.
but
they
are
using
the
liquor
illegally
seized
against
the
driver's
property,
his
automobile.
if
it
is
not
usable
against
him,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
should
equally
be
unusable
against
him
to
forfeit
his
property.
whether
we
call
this
a
quasi
criminal
case
or
whether
we
analogize
a
forfeiture
proceeding
to
a
penalty,
a
criminal
proceeding,
we
still
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
to
allow
the
illegally
seized
evidence
to
be
used
in
this
proceeding
in
court,
would
be
to
take
a
man's
property
without
the
due
process
--
without
the
factors
which
this
court
said,
fall
within
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
by
permitting
the
exclusionary
rule
not
to
apply
here.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
yes
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir,
i
believe
that
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
answer
is
that
i
believe
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
did
not
repeal
the
other
portions
of
the
constitution.
in
the
hostetter
case
before
this
court
just
this
last
term,
the
--
this
court
said
that
to
conclude
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
repealed
the
commerce
clause
is
in
absurd
over
simplification.
in
this
case,
to
conclude
that
it
also
repeals
the
equal
protection
and
fifth
amend
--
fifth
and
fourth
amendments,
would
i
think
to
be
even
more
absurd
of
a
simplification.
i
think
your
honor
that
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
would
still
apply
to
protect
the
driver
against
the
self-incrimination,
the
--
from
the
items
that
were
seized
and
his
property
from
being
forfeited.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
and
this
is
the
second
answer
justice
stewart,
that
if
they
--
if
the
states
do
or
should
have
the
right
to
stop
cars
entering
or
travelers
entering
its
borders
to
determine
whether
a
tax
has
been
paid
on
the
items
that
were
brought,
the
remedy
is
not
necessarily
the
forfeiture
of
the
items
which
they
claim
upon
which
no
tax
had
been
paid.
the
remedy
may
very
well
be
a
civil
proceeding
to
obtain
the
tax
against
the
individual
--
from
the
individual
who
was
bringing
it
in
or
possesses
it
or
controls
it
but
not
necessarily
a
forfeiture
of
his
property
which
they
have
found
through
official
governmental
lawlessness.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
justice
goldberg,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
so
do
hold
we
would
be
creating
a
series
of
50
european
countries
rather
than
50
federated
states
and
i
shouldn't
think
that
any
state
would
have
this
right.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
states
have
still
to
follow
the
constitutional
provisions
in
order
to
protect
their
own
revenue.
although
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
question
which
is
raised
in
this
case
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
justice
brennan,
i
think
again
that
this
--
we
are
questioning
the
remedy
that
is
left
to
the
states,
i
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
think
in
those
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
in
those
instances,
the
health
of
the
community
may
require,
this
would
be
equivalent
to
something
which
is
contraband
per
se
and
no
matter
how
they
find
it
as
in
the
frank
versus
maryland
case
or
as
in
that
hypothetical
your
honor
has
suggested
once
they
find
it,
it
might
be
contraband
per
se
or
contrary
to
public
health
and
safety
and
therefore
could
be
forfeit.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
right
sir,
this
is
a
revenue
problem.
the
automobile
i
again
go
--
dodge
the
question
of
the
liquor
itself
whether
that
is
contraband
per
se,
but
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
the
automobile
itself
was
certainly
not
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
and
in
the
--
i've
got
to
go
your
honor
i
suppose
certainly
they
do
not
take
the
automobile
for
transporting
corn
with
--
or
whatever
may
be.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir,
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
except
the
statement
in
the
superior
court
that
they
are
taking
judicial
knowledge
that
around
the
holiday
season,
this
traffic
increases.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
sir
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
would
also
--
i
would
like
to
add
to
it
if
not
accept
to
it
that
at
the
same
time
of
the
year,
traffic
in
legitimate
gifts
and
the
bicycles
being
transported
in
the
back
of
automobiles
also
increases
so
the
mere
fact
that
an
automobile
is
riding
low
in
the
rear
does
not
lead
ineluctably
to
the
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
justice
white,
if
that
were
possible
then
they
could
extend
that
through
all
times
of
the
year
because
it
is
not
only
a
holiday
times
that
people
in
pennsylvania
drink
liquor
which
had
been
obtained
from
new
jersey.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
would
say
that
there
is
not
a
significant
increase
in
that
period
of
time.
of
course,
whether
my
opinion
is
important
or
not,
that
is
not
in
the
record
here
and
it
was
not
in
the
record
before
the
court
below.
i
would
say
that
has
--
if
your
honor
were
cared
about
my
opinion,
i
wouldn't
say
that
an
increased
significantly
had
christmas
time
or
easter
time
or
at
any
other
times
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
thank
you
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
correctly
--
mr.
stanford
shmukler
that's
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
i
think
the
citation
from
the
carroll
case
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
that
they
also
should
be
noted
that
in
the
carroll
case,
the
court
specifically
said
that
under
the
act
that
if
no
probable
cause
were
found,
the
driver
gets
back
his
car,
he
may
lose
the
liquor,
but
he
gets
back
his
car
and
the
evidence
cannot
be
used
against
him.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
stanford
shmukler
i
don't
wish
to
over
state
my
welcome
here
by
exceeding
the
recess
time
but
i
have
just
several
short
points
i
would
like
to
make,
if
i
may.
mr.
shannon
has
told
us
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
gave
the
states
the
right
to
prohibit
liquor
traffic
and
i'm
not
disputing
that.
however,
even
the
statute
in
pennsylvania
set
forth
in
page
2
of
our
brief,
section
2209,
requires
reasonable
and
probable
cause.
and
as
justice
goldberg
asked
mr.
shannon,
you
do
need
probable
cause
even
to
exam
--
to
stop
the
car
without
a
warrant
here,
under
the
state
statute
as
well
as
under
the
constitutional
provisions.
second
of
all,
mr.
shannon
told
us
that
there
are
no
property
rights
in
contraband
and
that
the
driver
lost
the
title
to
the
car
when
he
entered
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
to
conclude
such
is
to
allow
an
enforcement
official
to
make
the
exact
determination
which
the
constitution
requires
to
be
made
by
an
impartial
objective
individual
in
determining
whether
probable
cause
has
been
shown
for
stopping
the
car.
i
think
judge
wyzanski
in
the
berkowitz
case
sets
this
out
very
well
in
his
opinion,
in
which
he
is
talking
in
reference
to
section
7203
of
the
federal
act
and
he
points
out
that
the
congress
cannot
preclude
the
holder
of
the
interest,
the
possessor
of
the
interest
from
bringing
it
in
before
the
court
of
confident
jurisdiction
for
evaluation
and
such
vindication
as
it
deserves
on
the
merits.
somewhere
in
our
constitutional
regime,
so
long
as
it
remains
constitutional,
the
holder
of
the
interest
has
a
right
to
present
for
adjudication
and
appraisal
by
an
independent
court
his
claim
that
his
interest
has
been
cut-off
by
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
application
in
this
case
of
an
act
of
congress,
in
our
case,
by
in
act
of
pennsylvania.
if
mr.
shannon
is
correct,
then
any
law
enforcement
official
makes
that
determination
exclusively
and
solely
to
the
exclusion
of
all
court
determinations.
third
of
all,
mr.
shannon
accused
us
of
quoting
only
criminal
cases
in
which
this
doctrine
applies
and
i
think
the
very
case
from
which
this
old
line
arises,
the
boyd
case
was
itself
not
a
criminal
case
but
a
forfeiture
case.
thank
you
very
much.
