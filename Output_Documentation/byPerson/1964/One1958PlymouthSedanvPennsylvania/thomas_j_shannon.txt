mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
if
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
given
by
my
worthy
adversary
are
correct.
i
would
like
to
add
of
course
one
thing.
the
driver
of
the
car
when
he
was
stopped,
what
was
in
the
record,
stated
that
he
was
given
$30
to
go
over
the
margate,
new
jersey
and
get
this
load
of
liquor
and
bring
it
back
to
philadelphia,
that
was
his
own
testimony.
now
that
is
in
the
record
and
should
be
taken
into
consideration.
in
going
into
this
question,
we
stated
in
our
brief
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
contention
of
the
commonwealth
is
and
i
think
this
court
has
reiterated
many
times,
we
are
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding
here
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
--
not
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
and
the
basic
question
before
this
court
is
only
defining
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
that
question
is,
does
the
exclusionary
rule
which
apply
to
search
and
seizure
in
criminal
prosecutions
apply
in
the
proceedings
in
rem
for
the
contraband.
here,
we
have
contraband.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
we
do
not
have
anything
that
is
not
contraband.
it's
been
declared
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
to
be
contraband.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
yes
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
pardon
me.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
no,
it
would
not
be
an
influence.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
very
true
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that
is
correct.
the
contention
of
the
commonwealth,
however,
is
that
the
twenty-first
amendment,
gave
to
the
commonwealth
the
right
to
regulate
or
to
prohibit
the
transportation
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
a
state.
in
other
words,
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
by
this
amendment
was
given
authority
to
regulate
any
transportation.
now
this
court
has
declared
in
the
case
in
1938,
mitchell
v.
helvering
that
congress
can
pass
a
law,
providing
for
the
forfeiture
of
offending
vehicles.
here,
we
have
an
advice
that
is
stated
in
our
brief,
this
is
not
a
revenue
statute
per
se.
this
is
a
statute
to
regulate
alcoholic
beverages
in
pennsylvania.
and
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
certainly
stated
that
there's
no
place
if
the
state
is
given
greater
primary
power
to
regulate
the
sale
and
use
of
anything
as
it
is
given
in
the
sale
and
use
of
alcohol.
now
under
that,
and
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
given
by
the
twenty-first
amendment,
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
passed
not
in
the
revenue
laws
but
in
the
liquor
code,
two
things
which
are
before
the
court
of
three
two
statutes.
number
one,
it's
illegal
in
pennsylvania
to
either
posses
or
transport
liquor
without
the
seal
of
the
commonwealth
on
it.
number
two,
that
if
you
do,
you
have
no
right
--
no
property
right
in
the
vehicle
used
to
transport
it,
that
vehicle
is
contraband
and
it
maybe
forfeited
in
a
proceeding.
we
set
that
out,
those
statute
are
set
forth
in
the
commonwealth's
brief.
now,
what
we
have
here
before
us
today
and
i'd
like
to
get
into
the
case
at
the
end
of
my
argument
is
actually
the
opinion
of
judge
wyzanski
in
the
berkowitz
case.
i
won't
discuss
that
now,
but
i
will
discuss
that
opinion
and
how
far
that
goes.
but
i
think
that
the
argument
of
my
worthy
counsel
while
certainly
appealing
and
it
--
appealing
to
me
and
i
know
it's
appealing
to
the
court
by
the
reaction
i
observed,
certainly
ignores
all
the
principles
of
forfeiture
law.
the
first
thing
--
the
purpose
of
the
forfeiture
law
is
not
to
secure
additional
revenue,
nor
is
it
as
my
worthy
colleague
contends
to
penalize
a
violator
by
taking
his
property
away
from
him.
that
--
neither
one
can
be
said
to
be
the
purpose
of
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
it's
rather
to
secure
a
compliance
with
the
law
by
taking
away
from
a
possessor,
something
which
had
been
shown
to
be
the
mean,
the
method
and
the
instrument
of
violating
the
law,
that's
what
we're
getting
at,
the
main
key
instrument
and
a
method
of
violating
the
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
no,
not
as
a
punishment.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
well,
as
the
court
here
had
said
some
years
i
believe
in
1890
in
the
stillwell
case
that
these
statutes
of
this
kind
are
for
the
public
good
and
to
prevent
public
wrong
and
therefore,
they
can't
be
given
a
strained
interpretation
to
help
the
claimant
but
must
be
given
the
interpretation
to
assist
and
to
help
bring
out
the
intent
of
congress.
the
congress
passed
the
law
and
they
did,
section
7302
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
it's
the
same
as
our
section
601,
which
we're
here
before
the
court
on
today.
that
section
was
to
stop
the
importation
of
liquors
into
pennsylvania,
section
601
the
same
as
7302
was
to
stop
traffic
in
the
illicit
liquors.
they
both
have
the
same
purpose,
and
that
is
to
seek
compliance
with
the
law.
now
pennsylvania
has
a
reason
for
passing
that
law
at
section
601.
they
wish
to
keep
out
whatever
type
of
liquor
they
don't
want
in.
not
because
of
revenue
laws
but
because
it's
in
the
liquor
code,
not
in
the
revenue
laws.
so
the
purpose
is
to
secure
compliance
with
our
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
no,
it
could
not
have
been
offered
against
him
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that's
correct
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
we
do
too
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
and
the
(voice
overlap)
–
we
are
arguing
one
further
point
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that
is
right
mr.
justice
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
no,
we're
not
saying
that.
we're
not
arguing
that
at
all.
what
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
what
we're
arguing
here
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
this.
that
man
lost
the
title
to
that
property
as
soon
as
he
entered
pennsylvania.
he
cannot
even
come
in
here
to
complain
that
somebody
has
taken
that
property
from
me,
doesn't
have
title
to
it
no
more
than
a
person
can
complain
if
the
representatives
of
internal
revenue
services
go
to
a
plant
and
get
a
bank
safe
in
showing
your
deposits
and
withdrawals,
that's
not
your
property.
this
man
lost
any
right,
title
of
interest
in
this
property,
this
automobile
when
it
came
into
pennsylvania.
now
we're
saying
here
also
that
the
fact
that
is
an
automobile,
doesn't
change
it.
the
court
here
will
recall
the
ryan
case.
in
ryan
case,
you
had
the
back
bar,
the
bar
with
the
stools
and
the
other
equipments
which
go
with
the
bar.
when
you
sell
liquor,
this
was
during
prohibition,
and
this
court
very
wisely
said,
it's
not
the
object,
it's
the
use
to
which
it
is
put
and
they
permitted
the
condemnation
of
forfeiture
of
all
of
these
equipments.
they
said
that
is
being
used
to
violate
the
law.
therefore,
it
doesn't
come
within
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now
we're
contending
here
that
of
course
of
an
article
of
contraband
comes
into
the
position
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
either
one,
the
man
has
lost
his
right
to
title
and
interest
in
that
and
has
no
right
to
the
return
of
it.
now
the
automobile
is
contraband
because
it
has
been
declared
so
by
the
pennsylvania
statute.
now
this
court
also
is
--
had
two
cases,
the
jeffers
case
referred
to
previously
by
the
court
and
the
trupiano
case.
the
jeffers
was
narcotics,
trupiano
was
a
untaxed
liquor
and
distilling
equipment.
the
court
said
there,
if
it
suppressed
the
evidence
as
far
as
a
criminal
case
is
concerned,
but
when
it
came
to
the
forfeiture,
it
was
a
different
thing.
the
evidence
would
not
be
suppressed.
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
apply.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
yes,
i
believe
they
could.
our
contention
is
the
fourth
amendment,
does
not
apply
to
contraband.
and
the
car
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
well
he
--
it
couldn't
be
used
in
the
criminal
case,
very
definitely.
but
the
idea
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
i
wouldn't
want
to
pass
on
that.
we
have
here
of
course
towards
--
which
is
a
moving
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
i
would
say
no,
they
are
--
the
car
was
not
moving
if
they
get
a
warrant
to
put
someone
to
watch
there
and
get
a
warrant
and
come
back
and
get
the
car.
i
don't
think
they
could
break
into
the
house.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
well,
if
he
broke
in
for
some
other
reasons
and
then
found
it,
no
you
couldn't
win
just
to
get
the
liquors
on
a
mere
suspicion
with
liquor,
but
if
he
was
in
looking
for
something
else,
like
in
the
harris
case
and
run
across
it,
if
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
had
narcotics
in
there,
and
they're
going
to
get
in
and
then
found
the
automobile,
i
think
it
could
be
a
forfeit
have
get
in
and
then
found
the
automobile,
i
think
it
could
be
forfeited
if
it
approves.
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
yes,
it
is
different.
but
i
don't
think
he
could
just
go
in
there
to
enforce
the
liquor
on
there.
we
have
always
held
that
a
man
before
it
can
go
into
a
home
must
have
a
warrant.
now
this
was
a
moving
vehicle
that
they
followed
across
the
bridge.
this
was
not
a
vehicle
of
–-
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
–
in
motion
at
the
time
it
was
stopped.
now,
in
the
jeffers
and
trupiano
case,
the
court
clearly
definitely
stated
that
arrest,
search
and
seizure
which
apply
in
criminal
cases,
do
not
apply
in
forfeiture
cases.
a
very
--
right
at
the
end
of
both
of
those
cases,
they
come
up
with
that
conclusion.
now
under
7302
of
the
internal
revenue
law,
the
courts
have
found
that
money
can
be
contraband.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
liquor
or
narcotics
as
claimed
here,
money
can
be
contraband
if
it's
used
in
an
illegal
gambling
operation,
used
to
violate
if
it's
a
method
means
and
the
vehicle
used
to
violate
the
law,
it's
not
--
it's
certainly
contraband
and
can
be
forfeited.
and
in
interpreting
section
7302,
the
courts
have
held
this,
and
this
is
the
thing
that
i
think
is
important
in
our
case,
a
forfeiture
occurs
simultaneously
with
the
use
of
that
vehicle
to
violate
the
law,
whether
it's
an
automobile
or
money
or
whatever
it
might
be.
that
car
was
forfeited
before
it
was
stopped.
that
car
was
forfeited
to
the
commonwealth
way
before
the
officers
of
the
pennsylvania
liquor
board
stopped
that
car.
the
courts
have
also
held
and
this
court
under
helvering
v.
mitchell
case
in
1938
that
these
proceedings
for
forfeiture
of
a
vehicle
are
civil
and
not
criminal.
there's
never
been
a
case
and
my
worthy
colleagues
has
been
quoting
criminal
cases
where
the
fourth
amendment
is
applied
but
not
one
civil
case
where
the
fourth
amendment,
in
the
helvering
case
by
this
court
has
stated,
that
forfeiture
cases
are
civil
in
nature.
now
there
are
two
very
good
circuit
cases,
the
ford
tudor
case
and
the
saunders
case
in
1958,
which
definitely
hold
that
any
legal
infirmity
in
the
seizure
will
not
affect
the
forfeiture
proceeding
because
the
guarantees
of
the
fourth
amendment
the
just
do
not
apply
to
search.
because
the
right
to
the
property
has
passed,
you
don't
have
to
search.
there's
no
search
necessary
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding.
a
property
right
the
man
has
no
title
or
interest
in
that
property
and
you're
only
going
out
in
getting
your
own
property.
that
property
belongs
to
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
either
when
a
man
loaded
the
liquor
in
it
in
margate,
new
jersey
or
at
least
when
he
touched
the
soil
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
so
there's
no
search
necessary
and
the
fourth
amendment
only
guarantees
against
unreasonable
search
--
and
you
don't
need
a
search,
you
just
go
out
and
take
what
belongs
to
you,
you
seized
it.
and
there's
no
search
involved,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
involved.
now,
we'll
certainly
admit
but
there's
someone's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that
is
right,
but
no
search.
no
one
have
to
have
a
search
as
in
a
property,
you
only
have
to
go
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
that
belongs
to
us
and
we
find
it
for
--
as
this
court
has
said
comes
into
possession
as
someone
else
or
comes
into
possession
someone
unlawfully,
you
can
take
it
from
person
or
a
shop
--
i'm
going
to
get
in
to
those
cases
right
now.
the
first
case
that
we
have
on
that
i
believe
was
the
case
of
142.
mr.
justice
brandeis
speaking
for
the
court
there
stated
that
what
happened
there,
prohibition
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
prohibition
agencies
and
automobiles,
with
the
question
whether
they
had
authority
to
do
it.
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
in
that
case,
“it
doesn't
matter
if
he
didn't
have
authority
to
do
it.
once
the
united
states
accepted
it,
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
authority
in
the
beginning,
gave
the
united
states
the
right
to
forfeit
the
vehicle
because
they
had
the
right
title
and
interest
in
it
and
could
take
it
from
one
who
brought
it
in
unlawful.”
there's
no
question,
it
was
raised
there
that
that
was
unlawful
taking
of
a
vehicle.
now
that
was
followed
by
the
dodge
case,
that
was
a
ship
case.
some
local
policeman
took
this
ship.
that
was
a
adopted.
mr.
justice
holmes
in
that
case,
he
concluded
there,
the
exclusion
of
evidence
obtained
by
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
stands
on
a
different
ground
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
he
relies
on
the
cooke
case.
now
the
cooke
case
would
--
and
we
must
look
at
it
in
the
facts
in
that
case.
the
cooke
case
involves
a
treaty
with
england.
we
had
a
treaty
with
england
which
provided
that
a
ship
could
be
seized
if
it
was
within
the
area
where
you
could
get
in
the
port
within
one
hour.
we
had
the
case
of
a
ship
which
was
out
11
miles.
its
top
speed
was
10
miles
per
hour.
it
certainly
couldn't
come
in
within
one
hour.
we
seized
that
ship.
now
that
case
and
this
is
mr.
justice
brandeis,
while
quoting
the
dodge
case
in
the
ford
coupe
case
held,
and
it
should
be
only
for
this
narrow
holding
that
where
a
treaty
provides
if
you
cannot
take
a
ship
which
is
out
a
distance
which
will
not
take
it
into
port
within
one
hour,
it
cannot
be
seized.
my
worthy
colleagues
want
the
court
to
believe
that
the
cooke
case
explains
the
ford
coupe
case
and
the
dodge
case,
it
certainly
does
not.
it
must
be
taken
for
the
very
narrow
holding
which
simply
states
that
what
is
involved
is
the
effect
of
a
treaty
with
the
nation
and
that's
all,
nothing.
it
does
not
take
and
explain
either
the
ford
coupe
or
the
dodge
case
and
also
mr.
justice
brandeis
here
reiterated,
that
we're
liable
to
enforce
a
forfeiture
if
before
the
court,
the
fact
that
possession
was
obtained
by
a
wrongful
act
is
irrelevant,
immaterial
he
said,
in
that
case
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
around
50
--
mr.
thomas
j.
shannon
yes.
it
is
quite
a
problem
and
as
the
court
asked
previously,
it
is
a
problem
throughout
the
entire
year.
as
the
court
well
know,
pennsylvania
is
a
monopoly
state.
all
the
liquor
must
be
sold
through
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
our
price
is
far
much
higher
than
in
any
states,
of
ohio
and
new
jersey
principally
and
washington
d.c.
and
we
have
traffic
coming
in
from
three
areas.
the
principal
traffic
though
is
over
the
bridges
from
new
jersey
into
philadelphia.
now
there
are
a
couple
of
other
cases,
the
galveston
versus
point
case
which
was
in
1818,
and
the
court
there
talks
about
in
a
forfeiture
case,
there
must
be
rightful
possession.
but
a
reading
of
that
case
will
show
what
the
court
would
say
you
must
have
the
property
right
in
it
and
not
the
means
or
methods
by
which
it
was
taken.
i
think
a
good
analogy
in
the
answer
to
the
questions
you've
been
posing
to
me,
can
be
found
in
the
illinois
case.
it's
in
the
$4171
in
u.s.
currency.
there,
the
court
made
a
very
fine
analogy
in
that
case
and
they
said
this.
“thus,
as
i
the
judge,
do
not
have
to
inquire
how
a
person
is
before
me
in
an
in-persona
action,
neither
do
i
have
to
inquire
how
the
arrest
was
obtained.”
i
think
that
is
an
analogy
there
that
is
very
important
--
that's
in
the
united
states
--
the
united
states
versus
$4171
in
u.s.
currency.
now
these
cases
i
believe
clearly
show
that
the
seizure
of
property,
the
title
to
which
has
been
previously
forfeited
by
the
illegal
act
to
the
united
states,
stands
on
an
entirely
different
ground
than
the
fourth
amendment
prohibition
in
a
criminal
case
of
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
in
the
first
case
--
in
the
forfeiture
case,
the
title
is
already
in
the
government.
therefore,
the
government
is
entitled
to
the
property.
somebody
is
holding
that
wrongly
there,
they're
entitled
to
it.
in
the
other,
it
is
not.
in
the
criminal
case,
they're
not
entitled
to
that
property.
now
one
case
that's
quoted
here
and
quoted
by
judge
wyzanski
is
the
boyd
case
in
the
supreme
court
that
some
75
years
ago,
the
supreme
court
decided
that.
in
that
case,
you
have
plate
glass
that
the
commonwealth
wished
to
condemn
for
non-payment
of
certain
importee
and
the
attorney
then
tried
to
subpoena
the
books,
documents
and
records
of
the
person
who
had
the
glass.
that
case
is
entirely
different.
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
from
that
case
and
that
shows
in
that
case
not
what
the
other
side
which
is
to
show
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
states
that
searches
and
seizures
of
forfeited
goods
are
not
embraced
within
the
prohibition
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now
i
stated
--
i
have
five
minutes
i
think
and
i
just
like
to
make
a
few
references
to
this
berkowitz
case
in
the
first
circuit.
in
that
case,
you
had
revenue
agents
who
dealt
with
berkowitz
who
was
a
gambler
and
some
of
his
cronies.
they
saw
money
passing
and
so
on.
they
made
an
affidavit
to
that
effect.
they
seized
the
money
and
the
fourth
said
you
can't
do
that
because
there
were
not
enough
facts
in
the
affidavit,
it
was
an
unlawful
search.
now
what
the
court
does
in
the
--
judge
wyzanski
in
that
case,
he
stated
this,
that
where
you
have
contraband,
if
that
contraband
was
obtained
through
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
you
can't
forfeit
it.
now
the
minority
or
the
concurring
opinion
from
the
case
states
differently.
the
concurring
opinion
seems
to
state,
that
you
can
providing
it
is
against
public
policy
to
have
that
property.
those
cases
and
there
is
one
other
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
states
that
search
and
seizure
and
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourth
amendment
apply
in
forfeiture
cases.
there
of
course,
they
remanded
it.
the
government
got
the
money
in
that
case,
so
that's
never
was
appealed.
thank
you.
