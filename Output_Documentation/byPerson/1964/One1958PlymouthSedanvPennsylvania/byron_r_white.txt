justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
i
suppose
if
the
officer
didn't
had
a
search
warrant
or
if
they
had
followed
the
car
and
have
seen
liquor
being
taken
out
of
it
and
then
the
–
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
car
being
forfeit
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
would
--
just
the
evidence
that
they
used
here
to
prove
that
it
was
a
car
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
government
could
keep
it
even
though
they
illegally
seized
–
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
destroy
it
but
they
could
not
introduce
it
into
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
there
any
thing
in
the
record
indicating
any
amount
of
--
any
significant
amount
of
traffic
in
the
non-tax
paid
liquor
between
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
accept
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'm
suggesting
--
i'm
just
wondering
whether
they
couldn't
stop
all
cars,
not
just
one
blow
in
the
rear
but
forget
that
fact,
why
couldn't
they
stop
all
cars
coming
in
new
jersey
to
pennsylvania
at
that
time
of
the
year
if
it's
likely
that
people
coming
from
new
jersey
have
non-taxed
liquor?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
say
that
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
traffic
--
