this
is
the
way
you
distinguish
jeffers
and
trupiano?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
could
state
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
acquire
every
car
coming
into
the
state
to
file
an
affidavit
to
the
state
law
that
he
has
no
untaxed
with
it,
in
your
opinion?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
there
at
any
event
would
you
not
say
mr.
shmukler
that
carroll
pretty
much
settled
this
problem
because
at
that
time
if
i
remember
the
case,
they
had
a
national
prohibition
of
law
and
the
court
said
that
that
didn't
warrant
stopping
all
cars
to
enforce
the
national
prohibition
law,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
even
though
the
driver
said
--
what
he
said,
if
in
a
criminal
case,
this
evidence
had
been
admitted
without
probable
cause
then
the
conviction
could
not
stand.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
shannon,
if
these
were
a
criminal
case
where
they
were
prosecuted
in
a
criminal
case
is
it
in
your
view
that
this
evidence
could
have
been
offered
against
him
by
reason
of
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that's
by
reason
of
what,
fourth
amendment?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that
its
application
for
the
states
under
the
fourteenth,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
that
in
substance,
then
your
argument
is
only
that
the
fourth
amendment
as
applied
to
states
under
the
fourteenth
doesn't
apply
in
forfeiture
proceedings?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
don't
really
rely
upon
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
if
you
relied
upon
the
twenty-first
amendment,
why
shouldn't
that
apply
to
a
criminal
case?
in
fact,
you're
saying
that
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
you
can
do
things
which
otherwise
you
cannot
do
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
then
i
don't
follow
you.
then
i
--
the
only
reason
i
follow
you
is
that
it's
a
forfeiture,
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
then
the
twenty-first
amendment,
is
irrelevant
in
your
stand
because
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
as
applied
for
the
states,
applies
to
a
forfeiture
proceeding
to
see
that
it
reapplies
to
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
you
are
relying
upon
the
twenty-first
amendment
as
giving
greater
rights
then
the
problem
that
bothers
me
is
how
do
you
distinguish
carroll
in
which
this
court
said
of
notwithstanding
the
prohibition
amendment
that
gave
the
united
states
presumably
equal
rights
that
it
gave
to
the
state
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
nevertheless,
the
officers,
enforcement
officers
to
enforce
the
liquor
law
of
the
prohibition
amendment
as
chief
justice
taft
said,
may
not
stop
cars
on
the
highway
at
will.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
your
other
argument
would
be
that
the
portion
of
laws,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
the
twenty-first
amendment
could
stop
any
car
coming
into
the
state?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
accustomed.
