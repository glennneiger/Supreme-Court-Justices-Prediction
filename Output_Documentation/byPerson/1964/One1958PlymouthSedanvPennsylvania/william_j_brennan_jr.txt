were

--
distinction
to
say
the
car
in
which
they
were
is
not
contraband,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
shmukler,
i
have
the
experience
of
being
stopped
when
i
cross
from
one
state
to
another.
i
have
one
inspector
asked
if
i
had
certain
garden
items,
corn
and
that
sort
of
thing.
they'd
asked
me
to
open
the
trunk
rack
and
that
sort
of
thing.
done
as
i
understand
it
because
they
have
a
problem
of
certain
kinds
of
illegal
to
something
like
that
and
so
they
as
i
understand
what
they
do
is
they
find
the
stuff
like
that,
they
take
it.
you
think
that's
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
they
take
it
and
destroy
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
tax
stamp
--
you
mean
this
unstamped
liquor
involved
only
a
revenue
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
don't
take
my
automobile
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
can't
hear
you
when
you
stand
back
there.
