justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
a
question
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
did
not
get
to
because
they
cite
a
standard
wrong,
because
that
court
held
that
even
if
there
was
a
probable
cause,
still
a
disciplinary
rule
did
not
apply
to
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
we
should
agree
with
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
we
would
--
wouldn't
get
to
this
question
although
you
had
properly
refer
to
the
first
question
in
your
argument,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
mr.
shmukler
they
had
to
make
you
change
around
the
order
of
your
argument
at
all?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
looking
back
for
a
moment
mr.
shmukler
to
your
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
and
assuming
that
you're
correct
that
in
the
ordinary
kind
of
a
situation
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
you
would
have
a
situation
here
even
less
probable
cause,
you
could
say
that
beck
against
–
there
was
beck
against
ohio.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
is
involved
here
of
course
is
the
search
of
a
vehicle
for
--
to
find
out
whether
or
not
it
was
importing
--
illegally
importing
into
pennsylvania,
alcoholic,
intoxicating
liquors
and
while
it
may
very
well
be
true
that
there's
no
general
power
on
part
of
the
state
officers
to
search
all
or
even
any
vehicles
coming
into
the
state
for
the
general
matter
that
after
all
was
one
of
the
united
states
has
created
in
the
constitution
to
prevent
the
balkanization
of
the
newly
independent
colonies
and
see
to
it
that
there
were
not
be
failures
and
that
kind
of
thing
directed
one
state
against
the
other.
still,
we
have
in
this
case
twenty-first
amendment,
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
does
--
you
have
each
state
great
unlimited
autonomous
power
or
very
close
it,
doesn't
it,
to
take
any
steps
at
once
to
prevent
the
importation
of
intoxicating
liquors
into
its
borders
in
violation
of
its
law,
and
it
--
might
it
not
be
true
that
the
--
this
is
an
exception
to
the
--
first
to
the
general
rules
to
search
and
seizure
and
secondly,
as
to
the
general
of
prohibition
of
indiscriminate
stopping
and
searching
of
vehicles
coming
into
the
state,
when
the
purpose
is
to
--
a
purpose
clearly
covered
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
don't
want
to
detain
you
but
i
don't
see
why
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
because
what
we're
concern
with
here
is
the
probable
cause
for
stopping
and
not
for
what
happened
afterwards.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
only
the
fact
that
it
was
had
all
his
liquor
in
the
trunk
that
made
it
contraband.
justice
potter
stewart
so
without
the
introduction
of
liquor,
you
couldn't
have
forfeited
or
you
couldn't
have
any
forfeiture
of
the
car.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
making
alternative
arguments.
that's
the
point
isn't
it
mr.
shannon.
justice
potter
stewart
the
two
reviewing
courts
place
their
decisions
on
quite
different
grounds
and
you're
making
both
alternative
arguments
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
under
national
prohibition
–
under
national
prohibition
surely
the
united
states
would
stop
any
cars
coming
in
from
canada,
couldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
more
--
that's
the
analogy
here
rather
than
the
seizure
within
the
united
states
during
national
prohibition.
