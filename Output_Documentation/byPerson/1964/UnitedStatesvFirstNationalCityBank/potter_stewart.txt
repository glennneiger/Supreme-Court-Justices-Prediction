about
whether

not
the

â€“
the

this
is
the
deposit
of
a
foreign
branch
in
order
in

to
evade

mr.

it
seems
if
this
was
a
court
of
equity,
i
suppose
the
court
could
have
attached
any
conditions
of
--
reasonable
conditions
which
it
chose
to
the
issuance
of
its
restraining
order
or
injunction.
justice

do
you
suppose
it
could
have
gone
so
far
as
to
provide
that,
if
you
the
government
wants
this
injunction,
you
shall
be
required
to
hold
the
bank
harmless
and
indemnified
for
any
possible
double
liability?
justice

if
there
is

but
you
could
just
say,
if
you
want
your
injunction,
those
are
the
conditions
to
go
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
as
you
were
arguing
the
risk
is
very
slight,
that
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
very
onerous
condition?
