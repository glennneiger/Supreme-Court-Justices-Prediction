mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
question,
which
is
important
for
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
the
revenue
laws
as
they
pertain
to
the
tax
liabilities
and
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
liabilities
of
non-resident
aliens
and
foreign
corporations,
which
by
virtue
of
realizing
income
from
sources
within
the
united
states
bring
themselves
within
the
orbit
of
our
substantive
tax
laws.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
taxpayers
and
nonresident,
it's
a
foreign
corporation
omar,
s.a.
the
question,
the
narrow
question
is
the
extent
to
which
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
may
exercise
its
equity
power
under
the
classic
sources
of
equity
power
and
the
power
granted
by
the
internal
revenue
code
to
assess
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
enforcing
tax
liens
and
reducing
to
--
for
collection
the
assets
of
a
taxpayer.
in
the
circumstances
here,
the
internal
revenue
service
having
served
liens
and
notices
of
levy
on
several
organization
of
brokerage
houses
and
investment
houses
in
banks
in
new
york,
which
held
assets
of
this
foreign
corporation.
the
internal
revenue
service
through
the
department
of
justice
asked
the
district
court
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of
these
administrative
remedies
available
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
so
far
as
we're
immediately
concerned
here,
asked
the
court
for
a
temporary
injunction
restraining
the
investment
houses
in
new
york
and
the
banks
in
new
york
from
permitting
any
transactions
with
the
respect
to
the
assets
of
this
delinquent
foreign
taxpayer
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct
your
honor.
well,
it's
not
disputed
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
they
haven't
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
they
will
have
an
opportunity
either
in
this
proceeding
or
in
the
tax
court
proceeding,
which
they
have
instituted
for
adjudication
of
the
liability
if
any.
but
for
purposes
of
the
matter
as
it
was
before
the
district
court,
there
is
a
liability
in
the
amount
of
$19
million.
the
problem,
if
i
can
state
the
problem
first,
is
whether
or
not
the
district
court
in
entering
this
temporary
injunction,
running
to
the
banks
and
the
investment
houses,
which
held
assets
of
this
corporation
prior
to
service
on
the
taxpayer
can
also
cover
in
that
injunction
transactions
with
respect
to
bank
deposits,
which
are
payable
in
the
first
instance
to
the
taxpayer
by
the
bank
at
a
foreign
branch
of
the
bank.
the
bank
is
a
single
corporation.
it
receives
deposits
at
many
branches.
these
branches
are
not
separate
corporations.
in
the
corporate
sense,
in
no
sense
are
they
separate
entities
and
it
is
our
contention,
if
your
honors
please,
that
this
power
of
the
district
court
under
statute
and
under
principles
of
equity
temporarily
to
phrase
the
transactions
with
respect
to
this
taxpayer
by
an
injunction
running
against
any
stakeholder
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
includes
the
power
to
stop
transactions
anywhere
under
the
control
of
the
lienee,
the
stakeholder
including
transactions,
which
the
stakeholder
may
claim
involves
some
action
by
it
or
refraining
from
action
by
it
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
in
the
first
instance
your
honor,
when
the
--
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
two
layers
of
remedy
here.
they
are
the
administrative
remedies
of
lien
and
levy
by
which
the
internal
revenue
service
can
normally
without
leave
of
the
court.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
where
there's
a
jeopardy
assessment
go
in
and
seize
bank
deposits.
we
have
--
there
is
in
the
code
and
we
have
invoked
here
for
a
number
of
reasons,
the
additional
power
of
the
court
to
help
the
internal
revenue
service
in
this
collection
process.
in
the
first
stage,
the
administrative
stage,
the
notice
of
levy
and
notice
of
lien
were
mailed
to
omar
at
its
office
in
montevideo,
uruguay.
the
--
they
had
a
notice
in
many
other
ways
that
they
were
under
investigation
and
that
they
know
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
of
the
action
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
have
filed
a
memorandum
in
this
court,
omar.
we
have
not,
however,
until
now
served
omar
by
process
of
the
district
court.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that,
some
of
them
good
and
some
of
them
perhaps
not
so
good.
we
have
been
in
a
quandary
all
during
this
litigation.
as
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
was
one
of
the
problems
your
honor
and
we
were
concerned
about
that
when
this
decision
of
the
second
circuit
was
on
the
books
and
threatening
as
we
think
it
threatens
to
disrupt
the
orderly
enforcement
of
the
tax
law.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
your
honor,
if
i
may
advert
to
those
treasury
regulations.
one
of
the
principle
and
to
us
as
--
in
the
executive
branch
most
persuasive
arguments
raised
by
the
taxpayer
in
court
and
out
of
court
and
they've
been
raised
both
places,
is
that
the
existence
of
the
power
that
is
claimed
by
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue
here
to
act
with
respect
to
the
deposits
which
--
to
deposits
which
are
payable
at
a
foreign
branch
of
the
u.s.
bank
will
drive
away
the
business
of
the
foreign
branches
and
its
in
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states
to
have
flourishing
prosperous
foreign
branches.
and
the
hard
case,
which
was
put
on
the
basis
of
the
situation
as
we
originally
initiated
this
action
was
a
swiss
or
a
romanian
will
be
loathe
to
put
his
money
in
the
foreign
branch
of
the
u.s.
bank
in
romania
or
switzerland
if
he
realizes
that
by
doing
that
he
is
immediately
subject
to
the
vicissitudes
or
the
whims
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
of
the
united
states.
this
treasury
regulation
is
a
self-imposed,
but
nevertheless
effective
restraint
on
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
for
bidding
him
to
seek
administratively
or
by
judicial
process
any
remedy
with
respect
to
a
deposit
in
the
foreign
branch
of
a
united
states
bank
except
where
there
is
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
person,
whose
account
is
at
stake
or
whether
the
deposits
in
that
account
or
where
the
deposits
in
that
account,
the
commissioner
satisfied,
came
to
that
account
or
were
credited
to
that
account
in
an
effort
to
hinder
or
defeat
collection
of
tax
on
income
realized
from
sources
in
the
united
states.
so,
the
australian,
egyptian
or
romanian
who
wants
to
bank
with
the
united
states‘
branch
has
never
had
any
transactions
in
the
united
states
need
to
have
a
little
concern.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
still
a
very
important
area
reserved
within
which
we
hope
with
the
decision
of
this
court
will
be
--
where
would
be
continued
--
be
allowed
to
continue
and
operate.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
applies
to
this
case
in
the
sense
that
under
that
–
we
could
proceed
under
that
regulation
in
this
case.
it
does
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
your
honor,
the
question
that
would
be
one
way
to
perhaps
to
decide,
i
really
haven't
thought
thought
all
the
facets
of
that.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
if
i
am
--
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
correctly,
i
can
say
that
if
the
court
--
that
the
court
can
dispose
of
this
matter
by
dealing
simply
with
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
issue
a
temporary
injunction
under
the
--
that
would
have
been
authorized
so
far
as
the
commissioner
is
concerned
by
the
regulation.
it
need
not
consider
any
other
issue,
but
one,
but
as
your
honor
put
it
to
validity
of
the
regulation.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
indeed,
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there's
a
finding
by
the
district
court
here
that
it
seems
to
us
substantially
to
restate
--
substantially
to
meet
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
regulation
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
was
an
liquidation
and
the
court
talks
about
a
clear
present
danger
that
the
liquidation
would
leave
the
government
empty
handed.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
indeed
there
are
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
it
frames,
it's
like
--
you
could
take
the
regulation
or
you
could
take
the
statement
of
facts.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
either
one
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
justice
goldberg
pushed
me
into
that
corner.
it
can
be
decided
in
terms
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
but
within
the
scope
of
the
regulation
that
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there's
an
ultimate
question
here
of
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
enter
a
temporary
injunction
where
the
defendant,
the
taxpayer
has
not
yet
been
served.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
think
that
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
you
wouldn't
have
come
any
closer
to
the
answer.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
we
believe
that,
as
i
was
about
to
say,
the
regulations
and
the
facts
are
the
same
things
really.
the
fact
is
that
there
has
been
no
service
of
process
so
far
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
longer
we
wait,
the
better
chance
we
have
of
serving
process,
we
think.
there
is
under
rule
4(e)
of
the
federal
rules,
we're
authorized
to
invoke
the
new
york
state
procedures
for
service
of
process
on
non-residents
who
had
transacted
business
in
the
state.
we
think
that
by
virtue
of
the
transactions
out
of
which
this
tax
liability
grew
by
virtue
of
the
activities
of
the
director
of
the
taxpayer,
by
virtue,
if
your
honor
please,
of
its
petition
to
the
tax
court
for
the
--
which
is
to
re-determine
the
deficiency
that's
asserted
here.
we
have
the
basis
for
service
by
substituted
service
or
service
by
mail
and
by
publication.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it's
before
you
only
in
the
tangential
sense,
your
honor,
there
are
some
cases
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
find
that
we
are
very
comforted
by
the
recent
decision
of
judge
mclean
in
the
district
court
holding
in
somewhat
similar
circumstances
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
it's
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
personal
jurisdiction?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
have
--
that's
our
second
position
your
honor.
our
position
is
in
two
phases.
our
first
position
is
that
we're
entitled
to
the
relief
we
ask
pending
personal
service
on
omar.
our
second
position
assumes
as
your
honor's
question
does,
if
we
may
not
be
able
to
serve
omar,
in
which
event,
we
claim
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
enter
this
order
quasi
in
rem.
the
obligation
of
the
bank
to
omar
is
a
debt,
which
is
owed
to
the
bank
--
the
bank
--
is
owed
by
the
bank,
the
bank
is
in
new
york.
therefore,
under
the
concepts
that
were
in
harris
against
balk
and
all
those
cases
that
there
is
a
reice
in
new
york
with
respect
to
which
we
have
jurisdiction
and
just
to
pursue
that
for
a
moment,
because
i'm
a
little
out
of
my
order.
we
claim,
this
is
a
pointed
issue
between
us
and
the
bank,
it
is
also
the
place
where
we
parted
company
with
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
our
contention
that
if
we
reach
the
in
rem
question
that
this
debt
is
a
reice
in
new
york,
even
though
by
contract,
the
deposit
is
--
the
taxpayer
omar,
is
only
entitled
the
payment
in
the
first
instance
as
a
technical
and
legal
manner
in
montevideo.
new
york
court
say
that,
makes
lascivious
of
the
debt
montevideo,
not
new
york,
therefore,
there's
nothing
in
new
york
to
form
the
basis
for
in
rem,
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction.
we
say
that
that
obligation
to
pay
in
montevideo
is
a
condition
to
the
debt,
but
it
doesn't
destroy
the
debt
in
new
york,
because
the
corporation
is
in
new
york.
further
that
we
could
meet
that
condition
if
we
had
to,
we
could
send
somebody
down
to
montevideo
and
make
the
demand
and
he'd
probably
get
the
money,
if
he
didn't
then
we
could
sue
in
new
york.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
this
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we've
considered
this
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
and
this
would
be
a
troublesome
question
if
we
had
the
quasi
in
rem
remedy
only,
but
we
do
deal
with
it
and
we
think
that
the
double
liability
question
has
--
first
of
all,
it's
premature
and
we
think
that
when
and
if
courts
must
finally
get
to
it.
they
will
find
that
it
isn't
--
that
it's
a
red
herring.
the
double
liability
question
was
anticipated
by
the
district
court
in
a
sense
when
he
in
framing
his
order
said,
“if
anybody
thinks
that
compliance
with
this
order
will
violate
foreign
law,
please
come
in
and
tell
me”
and
the
bank
didn't
come
in
and
tell
him
that
there
was
any
double
liability.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
but
i
suppose
your
honors
are
not
supposed
to
have
heard
that,
because
they
didn't
say
it
on
the
record
in
the
district
court.
in
any
event,
we
further
contend,
although
this
is
the
frontier
you
might
say
that
even
though,
there
are
these
line
of
cases,
we
lost
one
in
canada
fairly
recently
saying
that,
the
courts
of
one
nation
will
not
enforce
the
tax
judgments
of
another
nation,
where
the
judgment
is
rendered
in
one
jurisdiction
and
then
is
followed
into
the
next
jurisdiction
for
collection.
we
think
that,
that
is
different
from
the
case
where
we
have
already
collected,
the
bank
won't
have
a
double
liability
unless
and
until
it
pays
us.
in
that
event,
we
contend
and
some
of
the
material
that
was
included
in
the
brief
of
the
bank
at
least
with
respect
to
uruguay
suggests
that,
if
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
were
pleaded
in
uruguay
as
a
defense
by
the
bank,
it
would
be
a
good
defense
in
a
claim
of
double
liability.
and
beyond
that
your
honor,
there
is
this
mcgrath
against
city
service
case,
which
suggests
that
if
the
bank
is
driven
to
the
wall
on
this
and
is
ultimately
trapped
into
this
double
liability,
there
is
a
basis
for
claiming
that
they
have
a
right
for
a
just
compensation
for
an
unlawful
taking
and
can
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
on
account
of
it.
we
think
that's
a
long
way
off.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
sorry?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
there
is
this
--
i
just
referred
to
mcgrath
against
city
service,
we
might
resist
that
when
the
time
comes,
but
as
of
the
moment
that
seems
to
be
the
law,
it
is
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
we
would
--
well,
whether
we
resist
the
claim
or
not,
they
would
ultimately
be
disposed
of
in
this
court.
and
we
don't
think
--
we
think
that
the
double
liability
problem,
particularly
at
the
temporary
injunction
stage
is
premature
and
insubstantial.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i'm
sorry
sir?
how
long?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
if
it
was
decided
that
we
could
get
personal
jurisdiction,
we
would
attempt
to
enforce
the
lien
on
the
basis
of
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
and
as
i
have
suggested
earlier,
this
is
complex
but
feasible.
either
the
vice
counsel
or
the
counsel
in
montevideo
or
a
revenue
agent,
or
a
receiver
or
an
agent
of
a
receiver
would
presumably
present
himself
to
the
bank
and
demand
the
payment.
so
far
as
the
ultimate
legal
question
is
concerned,
your
honors,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
damaging,
it's
disabling
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
because
it
wipes
out
at
any
basis
for
invoking
a
remedy
to
sort
of
hold
the
forth
in
the
interim
between
the
administrative
action
and
under
the
administrative
process
and
the
effort
to
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant,
who
may
not
just
be
a
nonresident
alien
or
a
foreign
corporation.
we
sometimes
have
trouble
serving
process,
i'm
sure
it's
an
ancient
problem
of
tax
collector
serving
process
on
people
right
here
in
the
united
states.
there's
nothing
--
there
is
this
hiatus,
which
the
order
of
the
district
court
helped
discover,
it's
not
perfect,
but
it
gives
us
an
opportunity
to
find
out
where
everything
is
and
figure
out
how
to
serve
process
and
generally
to
proceed
at
it
in
a
more
business-like
way.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
of
course
sensitive
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
proceeding
in
equity
and
mr.
harfield
framed
the
question
in
terms
of
equity.
the
equities
include
as
justice
goldberg
has
pointed
out,
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
here
was
embarked
on
a
conscious
effort
in
the
nature
of
a
transaction
in
fraud
of
creditors,
the
creditor
being
the
united
states
to
get
his
funds
out
of
the
united
states
before
they
could
be
used
to
apply
to
a
tax
liability
with
the
respect
to
which
a
taxpayer
hadn't
filed
any
returns,
much
less
paid
the
tax.
the
bank
suggests
that
its
foreign
branch,
although
it
operates
abroad
with
the
protection
and
the
prestige
backed
by
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states,
should
be
a
kind
of
privilege
sanctuary
into
which
as
i
understand
it,
a
united
states
taxpayer
can
protect
his
funds
from
application
to
satisfy
his
united
states
tax
liabilities.
even
though
he's
been
served
personally
and
even
though
as
i
understand
in
response
to
the
questions
from
justice
white,
he
is
the
united
states
corporation,
not
just
a
foreign
corporation
nor
a
united
states
individual.
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
the
question
then
is
whether
in
those
circumstances
the
bank
should
be
exposed
to
some
imaginary
unproved,
problematical,
doubtful,
possibly
nonexistent
double
liability.
if
in
those
circumstances,
a
court
of
the
united
states
entered
an
order
against
the
bank
directing
it
to
hold
on
to
funds
in
uruguay
and
after
that
order
it
had
been
entered,
this
taxpayer
who
is
described
in
the
record
and
i've
described
sued
in
uruguay,
sued
the
united
states
bank
for
some
kind
of
tort
or
breach
of
contract,
the
damages
of
which
can't
even
be
defined
and
by
some
quirk
of
uruguayan
law,
the
bank
in
spite
of
the
defense
by
--
of
the
solemn
judgment
of
the
united
states
court,
in
spite
of
the
equities,
the
bank
were
held
liable
in
uruguay
in
that
action.
now,
not
only
is
that
we
think
a
far
fetched
unlikely
academic
guess,
something
that
this
court
should
not
rely
on
in
making
a
decision,
but
the
bank
attached
to
its
brief
in
chief
and
in
an
appendix
on
page
1(a),
reports
that
it
asked
the
uruguayan
counsel
what
would
happen,
if
the
bank
in
uruguay
refused
to
pay
under
circumstances
not
as
egregious
as
the
equities
in
this
case?
and
on
page
9(a)
of
the
appendix,
there
is
included
a
letter
from
uruguayan
counsel
to
whom
the
bank
addressed
its
inquiry,
the
letter
saying
that
injunction
order
issued
by
u.s.
court
is
not
applicable
in
uruguay
that
means
this
isn't
a
defense
in
uruguay,
unless
the
injunction
is
properly
submitted
and
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
uruguay
following
the
legal
requisites
required
by
uruguayan
law.
in
other
words,
the
suggestion
is
that
if
you
come
down
to
the
ultimate
essence
of
this
double
liability
issue
and
the
bank
vigorously
defends
itself
in
uruguay
as
it
would
and
can,
as
its
defended
itself
here,
the
uruguayan
court
would
not
hold
the
bank
liable.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
would
be
a
precedent
for
that,
your
honor,
at
least
the
legal
basis
for
that
kind
of
condition
in
this
mcgrath
against
city
service
case
decided
by
this
court.
we
think
that
that
the
bank
would
have
to
make
a
better
showing
and
we
think
it
can
make
it,
but
this
double
liability
before
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
if
the
court
entered
an
order
like
that,
it
certainly
would
have
the
power
to
in
a
proceeding
inequity,
we
would
oppose
it.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
indeed
so.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
cuts
both
ways.
it
might
cause
the
bank
to
resist
less
vigorously
than
it
might
otherwise
resist
it,
if
it
were
put
upon
in
uruguay.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
think
that
--
i
haven't
thought
this
through,
we
think
he's
--
that
he's
complied
with
the
regulations.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
he
didn't
at
the
time
this
action
was
brought,
because
there
weren't
any
such
regulations,
on
remand
probably
so,
probably
so,
probably
so.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
know
that
they
do.
i
was
trying
to
project
what
would
happen
if
the
high
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
know
such
cases.
thank
you
sir.
