mr.
henry
harfield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
judgment,
the
real
and
only
issue
that's
presented
here
is
one
of
fairness.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
injunction
and
the
respondent
is
not
and
at
no
time
has
been
appealing
on
the
basis
that
the
court
had
no
power
to
issue
that
injunction.
we
have
based
our
appeal
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
abusive
discretion,
that
it
was
an
inequitable
thing
to
do
and
so
far,
the
court
of
appeals
has
agreed
with
that.
now,
this
is
a
rather
broad
statement
and
i've
got
to
support
it
by
reference
to
the
facts.
let
me
point
out
first
of
all,
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
not
the
taxpayer.
the
respondent
has
been
conducting
its
business
and
is
in
no
way
delinquent
in
taxes.
so,
we
have
here
a
restraint,
which
is
imposed
on
a
third
party,
not
on
the
ultimate
defendant.
this
is
in
effect,
a
garnishment
proceeding
and
the
respondent
bank
is
in
the
position
entirely
of
a
third
party
stakeholder.
furthermore,
we
are
talking
here
about
an
action,
which
has
as
its
only
purpose
the
acquisition,
the
taking
of
property.
this
is
a
physical
action.
mr.
justice
harlan
said
we're
talking
in
effect
about
a
sequestration
of
property
and
the
property
in
question
is
the
property
of
omar,
not
of
this
respondent.
now,
the
property
that
we're
talking
about
is
not
the
property
in
the
united
states.
this
is
so,
by
definition.
the
court
below
did
not
refer,
my
learned
adversary
has
repeatedly
in
the
briefs
and
here
again,
today
did
not
refer
to
accounts
or
property,
which
is
collectible
in
the
first
instance
abroad.
it
referred
to
deposits
and
to
property
which
collectible
only
abroad,
only
abroad.
so,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
property
that
the
government
seeks
to
get
and
it
is
property
that
they
want,
is
property
which
lies
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
this
must
be
so,
because
there
is
no
issue
as
to
any
property
in
the
united
states.
mr.
henry
harfield
no,
sir.
it's
--
it's
a
--
mr.
henry
harfield
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
suggest
that
it's
a
good
deal
more
than
a
local
ruling.
mr.
henry
harfield
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
new
york
rule,
which
expresses
what
i
believe
is
a
necessary
conclusion,
if
you
examine
the
nature
of
this
property.
the
property
that
we're
talking
about
is
a
bank
deposit,
which
is
a
contract.
it's
not
--
it
might
be
better
for
us
if
it
were
simply
a
physical
deposit.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
my
point
sir,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
relying
on
new
york
law
was
going
beyond
that.
it
relied
not
only
as
it
said
on
the
new
york
law
as
such
but
on
the
new
york
law
as
a
statement
of
an
absolutely
sound
principle
and
the
principle
is
not
that
this
is
a
legal
technicality,
but
that
the
branch
of
the
bank
doing
business
abroad
is
--
mr.
henry
harfield
it
probably
would
--
mr.
henry
harfield
that
is
--
mr.
henry
harfield
no.
i
would
not
for
this
reason.
quite
clearly,
the
new
york
rule
would
suggest
the
same
results.
mr.
henry
harfield
but
i'm
not
suggesting
nor
do
i
think
it
necessary
that
be
the
case,
because
if
the
branch
were
across
the
street,
then
the
order
of
this
court
would
protect
the
respondent,
because
it
would
protect
the
respondent
even
if
the
branch
were
in
a
different
state,
because
we
--
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
do.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
your
honor
and
as
your
honor
is
well
aware,
the
foreign
law
is
for
the
court
to
determine.
now,
we
have
put
forward
here
a
series
of
opinions,
which
we
have
necessarily
selected
at
random,
because
we
can't
go
around
the
world
and
provide
unanimity
on
this
and
they
apparently
are
now
challenged.
but
if
they
are
challenged,
then
under
the
well
accepted
rule,
i
think
we
should
presume
that
the
foreign
law
corresponds
to
our
own
and
our
own
law
is
very
clear
that
if
the
government
of
far
office
stand
and
a
court
there
were
to
make
an
order
in
that
country
of
far
office
stand
purporting
to
restrain
the
first
national
city
bank
here
in
new
york
from
paying
its
deposit,
which
i
had
made
with
it,
that
our
courts
would
not
pay
any
attention
to
that.
so,
i
don't
have
to
depend
on
what
maybe
an
inaccuracy
proof
of
the
foreign
law.
i
can
rely
on
our
own
principles
and
similarly,
i
think
for
that
reason,
we
can
rely
not
just
on
the
new
york
rule,
but
on
the
fundamental
proposition,
which
is
that
a
bank
deposit
is
localized.
in
the
case
we
are
talking
about
here,
this
was
a
uruguayan
corporation,
which
made
a
local
deposit
precisely
as
the
same
as
if
it
had
gone
to
one
of
its
local
banks
and
in
local
currency.
we're
not
talking
about
the
same
kind
of
money.
we're
not
talking
about
the
same
place,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
same
area
of
judicial
protection.
mr.
henry
harfield
i'm
inclined
to
--
mr.
henry
harfield
sorry.
mr.
henry
harfield
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
should
like
to
abide
by
the
regulation
on
that,
but
i
can't.
i
think
that
the
regulation
would
be
as
mr.
justice
white
said
just
as
much
subject
to
challenge.
the
question
is
when
does
the
money
--
mr.
henry
harfield
both,
both
because
once
the
money
is
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
deposited,
then
the
taint
of
its
birth,
so
to
speak,
the
fact
that
it
was
spirited
out
in
an
effort
to
avoid
taxes,
doesn't
affect
its
status
in
the
foreign
country.
therefore,
neither
on
the
score
of
jurisdiction
nor
on
the
score
of
fairness,
in
other
words,
if
the
jurisdiction
i
think
is
clear,
if
it
is
out
the
country,
it's
out
the
country
just
the
same
as
if
it
were
a
physical
object.
on
the
question
of
fairness,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
to
the
bank's
liability
in
the
foreign
country
whether
the
money
came
out
wrongfully
or
rightly.
so,
i
stay
on
both
points
in
that
respect.
mr.
henry
harfield
that
is
my
point
and
i'm
not
saying,
your
honor,
that
if
the
bank
had
participated
in
the
removal
of
funds
as
a
conspirator,
there
would
not
have
a
liability
for
that
and
then
it
would
not
be
--
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
equity,
but
my
point
is,
that
if
the
bank
is
used
as
a
conduit
to
move
the
funds
out
of
the
country
then
the
fact
that
once
they
have
been
moved
out.
they
are
deposited
with
the
bank
there,
so
as
to
give
in
the
bank
an
absolute
liability
in
that
country,
not
subject
to
the
defense
that
our
courts
have
ordered
otherwise
then
you
have
the
same
problem
with
double
liability
and
that
is
the
basic
problem
of
fairness,
the
inability
of
the
court
to
protect
the
bank
when
it
orders
it
to
do
something
abroad.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
don't
have
any
--
mr.
henry
harfield
i
don't
have
any
published
figures
that
i'm
aware
off,
but
i
can
say
this
with
respect
to
the
first
national
city
bank
itself,
that
unless
i'm
wrong
about
one-third
of
its
overall
assets,
business
and
alike
is
in
its
foreign
or
overseas
division.
that
would
bring
it
in
that
bank
to
several
billion
dollars.
now,
that's
pretty
rough
and
i
don't
mean
it
as
a
representation
but
--
mr.
henry
harfield
this
is
entirely
possible,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
amount
of
foreign
currencies,
which
the
american
banks
accumulate
so
to
speak
by
going
out
and
doing
business
in
the
foreign
country
subject
to
those
laws.
what
they
are
doing
instead
of
sending
money
out
of
the
united
states
to
conduct
their
business
they
go
out
with
a
relatively,
in
some
instances
with
no
capital,
and
collect
the
local
funds,
which
are
then
available
for
loans
and
hopefully
received
as
deposits
from
american
companies.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
is
so,
i
would
not
myself
regard
--
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
it's
double
liability.
it's
a
question
of
multiple
currencies
--
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
it
does,
because
as
i
was
about
to
say
--
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
branches
in
the
courts
--
of
branches
in
this
country
as
i
was
about
to
say,
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
serve
it
solely
on
the
head
office,
but
this
is
something
that
the
banks
have
got
to
live
with
and
that
they
can
live
with,
because
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
at
this
point,
once
again,
i'm
basing
my
argument
your
honor
on
the
fact
that
it
is
inequitable
for
the
court
to
attempt
to
extend
its
power
beyond
its
borders,
not
on
the
question
of
power.
there
is
no
doubt
--
mr.
henry
harfield
it's
an
equity
question.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
order
this
bank
to
do
anything
regardless
of
the
consequences.
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
has
the
power
to
order
the
bank
to
violate
a
foreign
law.
it
has
exercised
self-restrain
in
that,
but
that's
not
an
abdication
of
power,
so
i
stay
with
that
point.
this
is
a
question
essentially
of
fairness
and
the
difference
between
the
various
branches
in
the
united
states
and
the
branches
overseas,
is
that
the
branches
in
the
united
states
are
dealing
with
the
same
currency
and
when
an
order
is
made
the
order
protects
the
bank
at
all
of
those
branches.
this
is
not
the
case
where
the
branch
and
where
the
relationship
exists
outside
the
united
states
under
the
laws
of
a
totally
different
sovereign.
mr.
henry
harfield
i'm
not
sure
that
my
client
would
let
me
be
here.
i
would
want
to
be
here,
your
honor,
because
the
question
is
one
of
protection.
the
jurisdiction
which
it
would
get
would
be
entirely
in
personam
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
could
protect
us
even
then.[luncheon
recess]
mr.
henry
harfield
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
devote
myself
presently
to
the
question
of
the
in
rem
jurisdiction
or
a
lack
of
it,
but
before
doing,
i'd
like
to
revert
to
the
question,
which
the
chief
justice
put
just
before
the
recess
as
to
whether
we
would
be
here
if
there
were
jurisdiction
over
omar.
and
my
answer
to
that
was
that,
i
would
hope
that
we
would
be,
because
the
jurisdiction
over
omar
the
in
personam
jurisdiction
would
at
the
most
be
a
rather
tenuous
one.
now
quite
clearly,
if
omar
were
a
party
to
this
proceeding
and
could
be
effectively
hobbled
as
far
as
any
reprisals
against
the
bank
overseas
were
concerned,
the
practical
risk
of
multiple
liability
would
to
that
extent
be
lessened.
but
the
difficultly
is
that
as
i
see
it
here,
if
there
is
to
be
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
omar,
it
is
purely
a
conceptual
jurisdiction.
this
is
a
uruguayan
corporation,
which
is
not
doing
business
in
the
united
states
to
the
extent
that
there's
anything
that
can
bite
down
on
here.
and
even
if
our
courts
were
to
assert
the
right
to
pronounce
a
judgment
in
personam
against
omar,
i'm
far
from
satisfied
that
this
would
effectively
prevent
him
or
if
from
taking
reprisals
in
courts
of
other
countries,
which
would
not
regard
the
order
of
this
court
as
a
defense
to
that
action.
consequently,
i
feel
that
the
absence
of
omar
as
a
party
to
this
action,
while
it
aggravates
the
situation
is
not
the
sole
determinative
factor.
i'd
to
talk
for
just
a
moment
about
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction.
yes
sir?
mr.
henry
harfield
yes.
i
might
as
well
take
that
at
this
point.
the
district
court
provided
in
the
order
that
if
in
consequence
of
this
order,
the
bank
were
put
in
violation
of
foreign
law,
then
the
bank
might
come
back
and
apply
[inaudible]
for
relief.
now,
there
are
two
obvious
problems
about
that,
which
leaves
the
bank
in
an
extremely
unenviable
position.
one
is,
that
it
is
impossible
to
anticipate
what
the
law
of
every
country
that
the
bank
does
business
in
is
going
to
be
in
every
particular.
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
bank
has
74
branches
in
28
countries.
in
each
instance,
the
branch
being
approved
by
an
agency
of
this
government.
mr.
henry
harfield
the
new
regulation
as
i
read
it
mr.
justice
white
provides
that
the
commissioner
before
he
applies
to
the
court
must
in
his
own
mind
determine
that
there
is
jurisdiction
or
if
there
is
not
in
his
judgment
personal
jurisdiction,
then
he
must
determine
that
there
has
been
a
removal
of
property.
but
--
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
there
is
another
provision
of
the
regulation,
which
says
that
the
hence
forward
was
not
the
case
here.
the
commissioner
is
to
specify
in
serving
liens,
the
general
area
of
the
world
where
he
hopes
that
there
will
be
some
money.
in
other
words,
he
has
to
make
an
affirmative
showing
and
point
to
the
bank
--
mr.
henry
harfield
i
just
don't
know.
the
--
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
returning
that
point,
if
the
service
is
made
broadside,
the
problem
which
the
bank
faces
is
that
it
is
going
to
have
to
determine
at
its
peril
whether
or
not
there
is
a
violation
of
law
in
any
country
where
there
may
possibly
be
property
of
the
taxpayer,
the
alleged
taxpayer.
now,
we
have
seen
very
clearly
on
this
argument
that
the
determination
as
to
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
foreign
law
is
something
which
is
not
accepted
just
on
the
bank's
say
so.
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
provision
of
the
order
doesn't
afford
any
very
real
protection.
moreover,
in
the
case
of
a
bank
account,
a
bank
overseas
as
here,
accepts
money
on
deposit
subject
to
the
absolute
obligation
under
the
law
to
repay
a
like
kind
and
amount
of
currency
on
demand.
now,
if
that
is
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
bank
branch
is
situated
and
the
branch
in
reliance
on
the
order
here
says,
“no,
we
won't
pay,”
that
becomes
an
instant
violation,
which
can't
be
cured.
if
the
bank
comes
back
afterwards
having
then
proved
to
the
district
court
that
it
is
in
trouble
and
then
comes
back
and
says,
“i'm
sorry,
we
were
guilty
of
conversion
or
i'm
sorry
we
were
guilty
of
slandering
your
credit
by
refusing
to
pay
your
checks”
or
as
in
brazil,
where
a
failure
to
pay
where
there
is
funds
on
deposit
is
an
act
of
insolvency.
the
curative
effect
comes
too
late
and
this,
if
i
may
dwell
on
that
just
for
a
moment,
there
is
very
definitely
on
the
temporary
aspect
of
this
injunction.
the
fact
that
this
is
a
temporary
injunction
doesn't
relieve
the
bank
in
any
respect.
it
maybe
temporary,
but
it's
long
enough
to
create
the
damage,
it's
like
a
temporary
cessation
of
oxygen,
which
beyond
a
point
is
not
wholesome.
mr.
henry
harfield
because
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
bank
is
subject
abroad
at
the
place
where
the
property
is
payable
or
returnable
to
an
obligation
of
repayment,
which
is
immediate
and
if
the
bank
in
reliance
or
in
compliance
with
the
order
of
the
court
breaches
that
obligation,
then
the
moment
of
breach
fixes
its
liability
and
the
fact
that
this
is
only
a
temporary
injunction,
doesn't
relieve
it.
mr.
henry
harfield
that's
right.
and
if
in
reliance
on
in
compliance
upon
the
temporary
restraint,
it
refuses
to
pay
the
funds,
then
its
liability
to
the
person
who
is
entitled
to
demand
them
is
complete
and
perfect
and
it
is
liable.
mr.
henry
harfield
it
is
a
different
kind
of
liability,
let
me
make
this
as
the
illustration
--
mr.
henry
harfield
the
damage
maybe
the
amount
of
money,
it
will
certainly
be
the
amount
of
money
plus
interest
for
the
delay
and
it
may
very
possibly
be
for
consequential
damages.
as
in
the
event
of
--
as
i
mentioned,
in
brazil,
if
a
bank
refuses
to
pay
the
check
of
its
depositor
even
though
in
reliance
on
the
temporary
injunction
of
a
court
outside
brazil,
that
is
an
act
of
insolvency
and
the
customer
may
not
only
recover
back
the
amount
that
he
has
drawn,
but
he
may
actually
have
the
bank
put
into
jail
and
this
is
a
worse
situation,
obviously
where
it's
an
american
bank,
which
is
trying
to
do
business
as
a
guest
in
the
foreign
countries.
mr.
henry
harfield
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
your
honor
as
to
the
nature
of
any
particular
accounts.
the
allegations
of
the
internal
revenue
service
on
this
were
that
there
were
transactions
here,
which
gave
rise
to
expectation
that
there
were
some
kind
of
accounts
or
some
kind
of
property
at
some
of
the
foreign
branches
of
the
bank.
and
subsequently,
after
the
appeal
below
the
attorneys
who
represented
omar
in
the
tax
court
wrote
a
letter
in
which
they
said
that,
at
the
time
of
service,
there
was
a
current
account,
one
current
account
in
uruguayan
pesos
and
an
amount
due
in
u.s.
dollars,
the
total
aggregating
about
the
equivalent
of
$2,000
in
uruguay
and
they
said
that,
that
was
all
that
there
was,
but
we
don't
know.
the
problem
that
is
faced
and
this
comes
back
to
the
question
of
the
so-called
new
york
rule,
the
problem
of
jurisdiction
in
rem
or
quasi
in
rem
is
this,
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
practical
separation
of
function.
the
bank,
although
it
is
a
single
corporate
entity,
operates
overseas
within
the
context
of
the
laws
of
the
various
foreign
countries
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
foreign
branch
of
the
bank
as
a
practical
matter
is
exactly
the
same
and
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
it
were
a
bank,
which
were
organized
and
existing
under
the
laws
of
that
country,
as
if
it
were
a
foreign
bank.
when
a
foreign
individual
or
person
or
a
friendly
alien
as
american
in
that
country,
deals
with
that
bank,
he
deals
with
it
subject
to
the
laws
of
that
country
and
entirely
under
the
same
conditions
as
if
it
were
a
bank
in
that
country.
the
result
of
this
is
that
there
is
not
and
never
has
been
any
property
in
any
real
sense
in
new
york.
there
is
no
real
tangible
property
here.
the
only
property
that
exists
is
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
depositor,
a
contract
right
and
that
right
has
no
existence
except
at
the
place
where
it
was
made
and
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
country
under
which
it
was
made.
the
consequence
of
that
is
that,
it
is
not
only
unreasonable
in
fact,
but
unnecessary
in
law
to
create
the
fiction
that
because
the
bank
is
a
single
corporate
entity.
it
is
liable
for
every
deposit
at
every
place
where
it
does
business.
the
result
of
that
in
turn
is
that
the
banks
contract
with
its
depositor
is
simply
to
repay
a
like
kind
and
amount
of
the
currency
it
has
received
at
the
place
it
has
received
it
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
that
contract,
the
foreign
law
of
that
contract.
and
therefore,
neither
the
depositor
nor
anyone
claiming
through
him
can
demand
at
a
different
area
in
a
different
currency,
what
the
bank
has
contracted
to
give
it
back
to
him
at
a
particular
place
and
in
a
particular
currency.
referring
to
our
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
and
i
think
with
justice
that,
just
as
the
bank
cannot
be
expected
to
respond
in
london
and
pay
sterling
in
respect
of
an
account,
which
was
opened
by
someone
in
rupees
in
india,
neither
could
the
bank
having
accepted
dollars
at
an
account
in
new
york
city
hope
to
discharge
its
liability
to
its
depositor
by
tendering
him
rupees
in
india
or
sterling
in
london.
there
is
a
localization,
an
unnecessary
localization
of
international
branch
accounts.
in
consequence
of
this,
the
new
york
courts
have
recognized
consistently
that
the
account
in
a
foreign
branch
is
not
property
within
the
jurisdiction,
is
not
to
be
treated
as
property
and
that
neither
the
depositor
nor
anyone
claiming
through
him
is
entitled
to
leap
the
barrier
to
anticipate
or
alter
the
obligation
and
make
the
demand
and
be
paid
in
new
york.
now,
the
--
mr.
henry
harfield
mit's
a
different
question
and
yet
the
thing
that
runs
through
it
becomes
a
nominator
of
it
is
that
if
the
bank
cannot
be
obliged
and
should
not
be
obliged
to
payout
and
dispose
of
the
money
abroad
by
reason
of
a
pressure
put
on
its
head
office
then
the
lesser
restraint
is
equally
objectionable,
because
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
whether
you
call
this
an
injunction
or
a
lien
or
a
levy,
in
every
instance
it
is
an
effort
by
pushing
on
the
bank
here
to
passing
on
the
property
there.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
assuming
those
and
of
course
i
do,
assuming
the
accuracy
of
those,
--
mr.
henry
harfield
assuming
the
accuracy
of
--
mr.
henry
harfield
that
there
was
a
danger,
a
continuing
danger
that
the
funds
were
being
taken
out
of
the
country.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that
the
--
and
i
do
have
a
concern
in
the
government's
ability
to
collect
these
and
i
think
that
the
government
has
demonstrated
that
it
has
an
ample
opportunity
to
do
this,
ample
power
to
do
it.
in
this
case,
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
here
in
new
york,
a
combination
of
securities
and
accounts
payable
at
lazard
and
lehman
brothers,
which
were
caught.
now,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
anything
that
is
here.
the
only
problem
is
when
do
you
catch
it
and
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
and
it
does
leave
the
government
in
perhaps
less
than
the
condition
they
would
like,
but
i
think
not
less
than
in
the
condition
they
are
entitled
to
under
law,
that
once
the
property
has
been
moved
out
of
the
jurisdiction,
then
the
motive
for
moving
it
out,
should
not
affect
the
depository
where
it
ends
up,
because
if
this
property
were
moved
out
the
united
states
and
wound
up
in
the
foreign
branch
of
a
british
bank
or
a
swiss
bank,
the
fact
that
it
had
come
out
by
stealth
and
conspiracy
still
would
not
mean
that
it
was
not
beyond
the
jurisdiction.
i
think
if
i
may
take
that
as
the
basis
of
summing
up
on
this.
the
situation
is
that
we
have
here
a
claim
by
the
government
for
property.
the
property
is
unquestionably
situated
outside
the
united
states,
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
indeed,
the
complaint
and
the
action
asks
as
the
ultimate
relief
that
the
property
which
is
beyond
the
jurisdiction
be
returned
to
the
jurisdiction.
this
is
a
requirement
which
is
beyond
the
capacity
of
this
respondent
bank
to
do.
the
property
is
outside
the
jurisdiction
and
they
can
return
the
property
only
at
the
risk
of
penalty
to
themselves
at
the
place
where
they
have
received
and/or
return
of
the
property.
the
injunction
or
order
of
the
district
court
whether
temporary
or
otherwise
cannot
protect
them
against
that
liability.
there
is
no
propriety
in
my
submission
for
either
the
district
court
or
at
its
--
at
the
government's
instance
the
district
court
to
attempt
to
reach
beyond
the
borders
for
property,
which
it
can't
in
fact
control.
there
is
a
way
to
do
it.
the
whole
trend
has
been
in
the
collection
of
tightly
extraterritorial
collection
of
taxes
to
negotiate
treaties
with
the
foreign
countries.
and
then
the
government
can
proceed
in
an
orderly
fashion
through
the
techniques
of
diplomatic
and
judicial
assistance
to
do
this
without
punishing
not
the
taxpayer,
but
one
of
its
own
citizens.
and
this,
it
seems
to
me,
brings
us
back
to
the
fact
that
the
court
below
properly
vacated
this
injunction,
because
it
is
not
an
instrument
of
equity.
it
was
wrong,
it
was
unfair.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
think
it
would
necessarily
cover
that,
because
in
the
case
of
the
american
company,
there
is
the
power
to
reach
that
company
and
direct
that
company.
mr.
henry
harfield
the
argument,
that's
right.
the
argument
i'm
making
is
that,
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
say
so,
the
government
is
kicking
the
wrong
dog
here.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
henry
harfield
it
should
be
entered
against
the
company,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
if
it
were
entered
against
the
company
that
would
control
it
and
would
leave
the
bank
protected.
mr.
henry
harfield
it
would
have
to
sue
for
not
having
done
that.
