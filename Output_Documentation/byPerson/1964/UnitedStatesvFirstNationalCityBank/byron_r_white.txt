justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
the
present
regulation,
which
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
if
the
regulation
for
example
had
wholly
forbidden
this
kind
of
an
order.
if
it
were
remanded
now
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
regulation,
i
suppose
the
same
question
would
still
persist?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
come
back
up
on
the
same
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
time
it
might
not
come
back
up,
if
you
couldn't
satisfy
the
terms
of
the
regulations.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
anything
other
than
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
these
sorts
of
rules
isn't
designed
to
deal
with
foreign
deposits
as
against
domestic
deposits,
but
in
fact,
this
is
much
--
that
rule
would
be
imposed
if
the
bank
is
across
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
the
results
in
this
case
ought
to
be
the
same
as
the
branch
that
you
are
talking
about
was
it
in
this
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
the
court
wouldn't
present
him
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
foreign
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could
be
an
overseas
division,
it
could
include
deposits
by
the
american
companies
who
have
been
subject
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
feel
that
if
the
internal
revenue
service
proceeds
against
the
main
office
of
the
branch
to
sequester
or
to
enjoin
the
paying
out
of
funds
that
the
bank
may
have
in
anyone
of
its
hundred
branches
in
this
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say
that's
part
of
an
injunction
that
is
justified,
i
mean
that
the
court
would
have
power
to
enter
it,
i
think
if
you
would
say
that
this
is
the
--
that
the
main
office
is
an
appropriate
place
to
latch
on
to
whatever
kind
of
property
this
is
and
wherever
it
maybe
located.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
is
so
then,
the
only
difference
is
this
case
is
that
the
depositor
happens
to
be
or
that
the
branch
happens
to
be
located
abroad
and
you
have
just
the
extra
problem
of
double
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
where
property
is
located
or
what
kind
of
a
debt
it
is
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
couldn't
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise,
this
court
could
never
do
it
in
the
case
if
the
branch
is
in
this
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
before
it
has
any
power
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
an
equity
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harfield,
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
anyway,
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]

[inaudible]
justice

justice

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
oberdorfer.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
oberdorfer,
do
you
have
any
doubt
or
â€“
what
is
the
situation
of
this
litigation
in
regard
to
the
new
regulation?
this
is
a
pending
case
that
isn't
over?
the
bank
came
in
and
said,
the
commissioner
must
comply
with
the
new
regulation,
at
this
point
would
he
do
so
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
my
question.
i
mean,
does
he
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
probably
he
would
have
to
comply
with
it
and
do
you
have
any
argument
with
the
mr.
harfield's
statement
that
the
united
states
courts
here
regularly
refused
to
recognize
orders
of
foreign
courts
similar
to
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
says
that
--
he
makes
the
assertion
that
the
domestic
policy
of
the
court
says
that
if
a
foreign
court
entered
an
order
like
this,
it
wouldn't
get
to
first
base
in
one
of
our
courts
here?
