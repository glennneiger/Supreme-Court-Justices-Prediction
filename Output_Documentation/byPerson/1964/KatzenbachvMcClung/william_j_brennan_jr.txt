justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
didn't
you
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
rather
inconsistent.
i
gathered
from
your
brief,
you
weren't
contesting
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
it
maybe
open
whether
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
concerned
which
suggests
the
courts
will
not
allow
actions
of
this
kind,
the
leads
of
the
enactments
of
this
kind
but
rather
let
the
statute
be
enforced
in
the
manner
that
it's
set
up,
isn't
that
really
what
you're
coming
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
were
amended
out
of
the
field
adjustment,
may
we
treat
them
as
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
should
we
completely
ignore
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
relevant
to
the
sullivan
--
sullivan
then
on
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
go
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
a
minute.
you're
not
making
any
different
argument
as
to
what
i
characterize
as
general
backdrop
kind
of
business
of
interruption.
in
this
case
and
you
did
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
findings
either
in
the
congress
makes
all
of
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
commits
on
agency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
mr.
smith,
is
that
--
i'm
getting
back
to
the
first
act
before,
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gathered,
that
the
facts
as
you
see
them
in
the
statute
constitutionally
at
least
one
of
them
of
those
that
either
the
statute
didn't
say
that
every
restaurant
has
substantial
amount
of
the
loose
food
that
comes
from
out
of
state
where
discrimination
is
found
affects
commerce
or
have
said
that
in
any
case
where
a
substantial
amount
of
food
comes
out
of
the
state
and
the
charges
of
discrimination
practices
by
that
question
affects
commerce
committed
the
decision
ad
hoc
in
that
case
to
some
federal
agencies,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
-
i
think
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
and
those
lawful
activities
we're
talking
about
here
discrimination
and
choices
specifically,
the
discrimination
and
choice
of
customer,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
a
discriminate
--
discriminatory
selection
of
customers
in
any
restaurant
the
substantial
amount
of
loose
food
comes
from
other
state
affects
commerce
either
that
kind
of
finding
or
whatever
form
it
is
by
the
congress
itself
or
the
commission
by
the
congress
to
some
agency
where
they
are
making
of
that
finding
has
a
particular
restaurants,
is
that
what
your
position
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
do
you
feel
that
has
to
be
one
or
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
don't
you
think
such
a
restaurant
insofar
as
this
provision
of
the
statute
is
concerned,
could
go
in
and
get
an
injunction
looked
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
statute
doesn't
give
you
an
equal
opportunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
a
matter
of
hearing.
it's
a
matter
of
that's
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
irrational
definition
for
congress
who
made
in
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
had
all
kinds
mr.
smith,
would
suggest
something.
in
this
whole
picture,
may
we
take
some
judicial
notice
and
100
of
cases
we
have
here,
what
this
is
all
about
in
restaurants.
