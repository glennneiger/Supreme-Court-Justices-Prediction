justice

[inaudible]
before
this
court
for
the
first
time
where
you
pointed
out
this
morning
it's
of
utmost
public
importance
of
this
question
would
be
settled
and
where
he
stands
in
running
--
it's
appropriate
--
it's
a
very
different
thing
once
the
law
has
settled
down
on
the
statute
assuming
when
--
then
you
are
plagued
with
all
kinds
of
suits
that
raise
in
substantial
questions,
then
you
might
have
raised
different
situations
and
does
it
follow
that
because
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
permissible
at
this
threshold
stage
of
the
statute
that
it
would
be
permissible
in
all
cases
once
the
validity
of
the
statute
if
you
prevail
on
this
case
is
sustained.

sure
that
he
wants

justice

[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
do
with
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
congress
has
said
that
--
it's
outlawed
without
regard
if
you're
talking
about
finding
what
congress
has
said
that
if
a
man
who
has
food
[inaudible]
potential
part
of
which
has
moved
into
interstate
commerce
[inaudible]
justice
hugo

do
you
think
that
congress
might
have
found
the
people
can
[inaudible]
future
but
have
already
put
it
in
there.
if
with
that
power
if
you're
--
you're
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
that's
really
quite
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.

justice

justice

the

[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.

$70,000
[inaudible]
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
argued,
what
the
congress
had
the
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
argument
has
been
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
again
it
said
at
some
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
i
think
it's
quite
important
that,
that
argument
be
either
obliged
and
--
or
taken
out
of
the
case.
well,
i
think
your
argument
on
that
premise
that
you're
arguing
on
this
are
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
about
a
hundred
cases
i
guess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
me
gratifies
for
a
long
time,
has
settled
your
basic
point
against
you
which
is
that
the
mere
ending
of
the
commerce
coming
to
rest
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
it
doesn't
take
away
congressional
power
regulated
in
that
field
in
order
to
prevent
burden
of
commerce.
there
are
at
least
25
to
50
cases,
that's
what
it
tells.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
but
we
had
--
i
happen
to
recall
one
of
plasterer's,
plasterer's
union
where
there
was
a
combination
between
union
and
the
contracts
in
regard
to
plasterers
in
a
city.
but
we
feel
that
was
--
it
was
when
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
under
the
antitrust
law
and
the
bradford
case
which
--
long
time
ago,
we
had
this
question
about
--
it's
already
in
and
in
the
sullivan
case
that
i
mentioned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
the
basic
idea
on
which
they
rest
with
the
clause,
what
congress
has
acted
on
this,
maybe
they
were
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
basic
reason
for
those
cases
was
that
although
the
commerce
had
him
in
the
activities
with
reference
to
which
were
purely
local,
congress
still
had
power
to
regulate
it
because
it
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
what
they're
regulating
here
are
the
activities
relating
to
goods
that
it
moved
in
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
thought
they
can
because
that's
what
they're
regulating.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
thought
you
said
that
because
i
wanted
you
to
take
your
view
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
i
see
it.
that
point
is
foreclosed
by
past
cases
unless
we
overrule
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
believe
i
would
be
a
genius
enough
to
do
it.[laughter]
