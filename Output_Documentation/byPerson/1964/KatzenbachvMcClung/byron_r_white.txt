justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
--
i
got
to
say
that
we
cannot
and
could
not
take
this
case
as
though
it
would
request
for
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
he
has
the
real
thrust
--
a
thrust
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
the
fact
that
invalidly
it
did
apply
to
any
other
reference
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yours
is
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
might
be
other
reference.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reference
that
you
can
purchase
more
food
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think
this
is
--
if
you
can
find
theory
in
your
argument
i
guess
exactly
that's
still
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
even
if
congress
reach
a
restaurant
based
solely
on
its
purchases
in
the
interstate
commerce,
even
if
that
was
so,
nevertheless
congress
cannot
necessarily
conclude
that
discrimination
in
that
restaurant
affect
commerce.
are
you
making
a
separate
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
your
basic
point,
your
base
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
congress
has
declared
in
the
act
that
--
that
any
restaurant
that
makes
certain
kinds
of
purchases
--
its
operations
do
affect
commerce.
it's
declared
that
--
you
object
to
that
as
a
quite
old
restaurant
or
at
any
restaurant.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
said
that
in
the
words
that
they
--
the
operations
in
the
establishment
of
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
one
thing
they
haven't
said
in
the
act
is
that
--
in
one
of
these
kinds
of
--
in
this
kind
of
an
establishment,
discrimination
would
affect
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
you
saying
--
is
this
part
of
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
that
we
do
have
a
restaurant
where
--
where
the
50%
--
what
the
congress
has
said,
every
restaurant
[inaudible]
presented
his
customers
[inaudible]
travel.
i
take
it
that's
the
case
where
you
would
say
congress
had
--
have
power
of
the
commerce
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
event,
what
about
congress'
judgment
also
that
--
that
discrimination
in
that
class
of
restaurant
should
be
proscribed.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
once
--
if
you
say
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
the
operations
of
the
resident
that
congress
could
also
on
this
record,
reasonably
conclude
the
discrimination
in
those
operations
at
the
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
relevance
of
the
interstate
traveler
is
just
to
underpin
the
power
of
commerce,
that
power
of
congress
to
--
to
control
the
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i'm
talking
about
one
of
those
kinds
of
--
you
agree
that
congress
has
got
some
power
to
regulate
those
restaurants
to
--
in
that
traveler.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
agree
that
congress
--
would
you
that
congress
could
therefore
regulate
discrimination
in
that
category.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
i
don't
catch
up
your,
that
last
part
of
your
argument.
do
you
say
that
the
purchases
of
this
restaurant
involved
in
this
case
is
from
outside
the
state
are
substantial?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
point
is
i
gather
that
--
that
congress'
power
--
justice
byron
r.
white
congress'
power
cannot
be
rested
upon
this
mere
purchasing
from
outside
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
discrimination
and
purchasing
or
between
purchases
and
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
didn't
know
--
you
know
you
denied
that
the
purchase
would
substantially
decrease,
but
that's
not
a
burden
on
the
congress?
