justice

how
can

do

with
your
case

you
certainly

suppose

forget
about
the
injunction
for
a

certainly
the
[inaudible]
a

judge,
you
could
hardly
say
in
this
case
that
there's
controversy
involved
in
the
context
of
this
lawsuit,
could
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
sustain
your
effective
commerce
argument
in
this
case
as
distinguished
in
the
first
case,
do
you
have
to
--
do
you
rely
simply
on
the
fact
that
the
findings
or
the
evidence
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
record
shows
an
effect
on
commerce
in
relation
to
the
purchase
of
interstate,
use
of
interstate
food
or
do
you
go
further
than
that
and
rely
on
any
effect
on
commerce?
justice
john
m.
harlan
coming
to
purchase
because
they
don't
like
the
city
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
substantial
portion
of
which
is
moved
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
injunction
would
be
lifted
insofar
as
this
provision
of
the
statute
is
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
agree
with
it.
what
do
you
do
with
the
second
point
of
the
government's
argument,
that
this
statute
does
cover
and
there
is
evidence
to
support
it
any
kind
of
restraint
on
the
commerce.
maybe
this
restaurant
would
never
have
purchased
a
nickel
to
worth
approved
again
in
commerce,
but
the
fact
that
it
is
discriminating
prevents
people
from
coming
to
atlanta
and
buying
in
a
department
stores
etcetera,
which
as
i
understand
it
is
the
second
branch
of
their
argument.(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
whether
to
understand
their
abandonment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
that
isn't
quite
the
argument.
i
understood
the
argument
--
the
government's
argument
was
that
congress
stopped
short
of
that
and
they
said
“we
will
deal
with
the
restaurant
that
has
purchased
food
--
has
purchased
food
that
was
moved
in
commerce,”
but
when
it
comes
to
effect
on
commerce,
we're
not
limited
in
showing
an
affect
on
commerce
to
the
question
as
to
whether
that
restaurant
or
a
restaurants
generally
[inaudible]
food
in
commerce
but
they
can
rely
on
the
general
evidence,
as
i
get
it
that
trade
generally,
interstate
trade
generally
in
atlanta
is
affected
by
that
category
of
discrimination
and
--
or
discrimination
in
that
category
of
restaurant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
how
i
understood
their
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
there
was
a
--
i
think
throughout
the
hearings,
there
was
a
--
and
throughout
the
solicitor
general's
argument
here,
there
is
a
--
their
suggestion
that
there
was
an
effort
to
remove
the
--
to
remove
the
clause
of
the
demonstrations
and
that
the
cause
--
the
basic
cause
of
them
back
there
was
discrimination
in
restaurants.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
they
didn't.
they
didn't
report
to
proceed
in
that
case
by
case
basis.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah,
but
only
on
the
issue
is
to
whether
it
satisfy
the
statutory
test.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah,
but
once
you
approve
interstate
in
the
case
of
restaurants
wouldn't
you
prove
the
service
or
offer
to
serve
interstate
customers
or
the
purchase
of
food,
service
the
food
which
has
moved
in
commerce,
then
there's
no
other
issue
back
to
be
tried.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
you
don't,
this
is
not
a
statute
like
the
national
labor
relations
statute
where
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
commerce
issue
itself
as
it
is
an
administrative
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
--
i
thought
you
said
if
i
get
you
correctly.
i
thought
you're
argument
has
two-fold
namely
that
congress
has
put
in
a
self-liquidating,
self-defining
terms
of
affecting
commerce
that
the
definition
is
chosen,
is
a
rational
one
because
once
purchase
of
food
doesn't
mean
that
you
are
now
purchasing
food
–
you
are
serving
food
that
you
move
in
commerce.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
since
the
congress
did
not
provide
for
a
honing
on
that
question,
this
is
a
new
valid
exercise,
there's
no
effect
on
commerce
shown.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
third
approach
which
you're
going
to
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
ask
you
one
question
on
the
procedural
point.
is
your
client
willing
to
have
this
case
in
its
present
posture
regarded
as
an
appeal
from
a
declaratory
injunction
without
an
injunction?
in
other
words,
are
you
willing
to
consent
to
the
vacation
so
to
speak
of
the
injunction
that
justice
black
has
already
succeeded
the
vacation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
you're
properly
up
here
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
properly
up
here
even
though
if
--
just
as
if
this
case
had
been
brought
before
a
single
judge
court.
