but
this
was
a
regular
pattern
of
purchase
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
then,
why
wasn't
that
suggestion
made
earlier,
the
appropriate
one
that
--
this
case
should
be
tried
in
the
regular
procedure,
and
the
regular
procedures
require
it
in
the
act
itself.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
if
the
attorney
general
--
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
that
this
should
be
dismissed,
this
case
should
be
dismissed,
maybe
this
is
premature,
maybe
we
don't
know
enough
about
it,
maybe
we
should
await
a
suit
by
the
aggrieved
person.
then
it
would
go
to
a
court,
we
would
have
hearings
on
this
point.
maybe
you
could
prove
that
your
restaurant
was
--
these
are
isolated
purchases
that
the
restaurant
was
completely
out
of
this
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
do
you
mean
in
your
brief
when
you
say
that
--
in
some
way
at
some
point
a
casual
relationship
between
a
particular
local
activity
in
interstate
commerce
must
be
shown.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh!
in
the
statute?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
you've
been
adequacy
of
hearing
so
on.
