justice
potter
stewart
but
you
really
would
welcome
a
determination
of
the
substantive
constitutional
issue,
you
could
have
very
well
counter
claim
here
as
you
did
in
the
case
you
just
had
argued,
didn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
the
allegations
in
the
--
in
their
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
heart
of
atlanta
case,
you
waive
it
by
counter
claiming
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
could
have
done
that
here,
couldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
only
real
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
yes
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
agree
with
that
later,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
that
this
restaurant
could
get
out
from
under
the
statute
by
simply
being
very
careful
to
buy
food
which
was
meat
which
came
from
local
animals,
locally
slaughtered
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
that's
part
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
think
it
could
be
made
a
federal
offense
for
a
man
to
strike
his
wife
with
a
baseball
bat
and
report
it
to
another
state?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it's
quite
unnecessary
in
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
the
restaurant
(voice

and
say
we
do
not
deserve
this
in
the
precedents
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
we
go
and
say,
we
do
not
now
serve
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
north
carolina
restaurant
once
it
used
up
all
the
hams,
the
virginia
hams
that
[inaudible]
and
then
--
from
then
on
i
want
to
buy
north
carolina
ham,
it
could
go
ahead
and
get
the
injunction
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
that
the
statute
covers
you
by
its
term?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
did
raise
the
point
of
the
constitution
requires
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
statute
doesn't.
you're
under
the
words
of
the
statute
as
you
and
the
government
both
agree
but
you
said
that's
not
enough
constitutionally,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
do
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
we
would
better
wait
to
have
that
cleared
up
by
the
solicitor
general.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
really
care
the
way
mr.
justice
harlan
did
but
that's
the
matter
of
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
to
remove
them
â€“
justice
potter
stewart
the
demonstrations
were
about
restaurants
particularly
in
many
areas.
justice
potter
stewart
variety
store
or
restaurant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
you're
complaining
about.
justice
potter
stewart
this
maybe
a
lunch
time
eating
place
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
business
people
who
are
in
the
area
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well
presumably
it
is,
let's
say
it's
perfectly
a
valid
statute
so
long
as
this
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
something
else
again.
