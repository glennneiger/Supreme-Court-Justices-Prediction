mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
manner
in
which
these
cases
have
been
combined
for
argument
and
the
fact
that
court
has
heard
several
hours
now
discussions
of
the
structure
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
title
ii,
with
the
court's
permission,
we
are
going
to
depart
from
the
planned
order
of
our
argument
and
say
first
what
we
do
not
contend
and
what
we
do
contend
so
as
to
bring
the
argument
that
follows
into
a
better
focus.
we
do
not
have
any
disagreement
with
the
solicitor
general
as
to
congress
having
a
very
broad
power
to
regulate
local
activities
wholly
within
a
state
where
they
bear
a
close
and
substantial
relationship
to
interstate
commerce.
this
point
has
been
made
in
every
brief
of
memorandum
that
we
have
filed
in
this
case,
nor
do
we
contend
that
congress
may
not,
under
the
commerce
clause,
deal
with
the
question
of
racial
discrimination
and
segregation
in
certain
places
of
public
accommodation
including
certainly
some
restaurants.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
this
act
by
use
of
the
means
that
there
was
employed
and
by
the
breadth
of
the
act
has
brought
within
the
scope
of
coverage
restaurants
over
which
congress
does
not
have
any
demonstrated
or
demonstrable
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
and
it
must
therefore,
be
held
unconstitutional
certainly
as
applied
to
these
appellees
whose
factual
situation
in
and
of
itself
shows
a
typical
example
of
a
restaurant
that
it
cannot
constitutionally
apply
to.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
and
i
do
not
mean
to
be
evasive.
that
question
is
not
presented
in
our
case.
it
is
not
argued
in
our
case
by
the
government.
we
have
some
doubts
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
language
in
that
part
of
the
statute
that
is,
serves
all
office
to
serve
and
never
quite
explains
who
is
an
interstate
traveler,
but
subject
to
those
doubts,
we
would
not
question
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
regulate
certain
restaurants
that
are
related
directly
to
the
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
senate
bill,
i
believe,
the
language
was
somewhat
different
and
from
our
standpoint
considerably
better
in
limiting
it
more
than
this
fellow
--
this
--
this
offering
to
serve
device
does.
we
don't
make
that
point
and
we
concede
that
with
proper
language,
they
could
do
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
your
honor,
i'm
in
something
in
a
disadvantage
of
trying
to
reply
specifically
to
an
argument
in
that
brief
because
we
wrote
mr.
greenberg
and
told
him
that
we
would
not
consent
to
the
filing
of
the
brief
before
today
simply
because
of
the
burden
getting
this
case
ready
and
briefed
in,
in
eight
days.
i
have
not
thoroughly
read
the
brief
however
we
deal
with
it
to
some
extent
in
our
present
brief
and
we'd
be
glad
to
deal
with
it
more.
certainly
on
this
record,
there
--
there
is
no
way
on
earth
to
conclude
that
any
interstate
traveler
has
ever
been
served
in
this
restaurant
and
the
court
below
on
substantial
evidence
found
--
the
court
found
that
there
is
no
offer
to
serve.
so
if
we
think
on
this
record,
we
just
don't
have
a
case
to
get
deeply
into
that.
now
it
is
not
our
purpose,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
try
to
urge
upon
this
court
any
restrictions
upon
the
commerce
clause
or
any
retrenchment
of
position
that
has
been
maintained
in
other
cases.
what
we
see
is
that
the
deciding
cases
in
the
statutory
precedents
that
these
proponents
of
this
act
relied
upon
are
not
precedents
and
there
are
no
authorities
upon
which
to
find
that
this
act
is
constitutional.
we
don't
argue
it
on
the
basis
of
the
tenth
and
the
ninth
amendments.
we
think
it's
a
truism
that
the
commerce
acted
beyond
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause
certainly
it
violates
the
tenth
amendment.
certainly,
we
have
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
but
we
are
constrained
to
concede
that
those
rights
are
subject
to
a
considerable
amount
of
influence
at
least
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
think
the
case
must
be
decided
under
the
commerce
clause
and
in
view
of
the
questions
and
discussions
that
have
been
held
in
the
past
several
hours,
we
would
like
to
confine
our
argument
initially
at
least
primarily
to
the
kinds
of
things
that
were
asked
about.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
i
think
yes
mr.
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
take
the
position,
mr.
justice
white
that
this
act
as
it
is
drawn
with
respect
to
the
food
test
applies
to
restaurants
to
which
it
may
not
validly
be
applied
and
is
therefore
on
that
test
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
and
ours
is
one
of
them
that
happen
to
illustrate.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
might
be
other
reference.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
no
sir.
i
don't
think
that
any
--
i
don't
think
that
the
act
could
be
used
on
this
basis
to
apply
to
any
restaurant.
that
happens
to
be
my
opinion.
i
certainly
in
this
--
on
this
record,
we
don't
take
on
that
much
of
an
argument.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
are
making,
we
are
making
that
point
--
it
maybe
made
in
a
slightly
different
context.
we
say
first
--
the
congress
have
to
somehow
determine
that
a
policy
of
racial
exclusion
or
selection
in
a
restaurant
would
have
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
they
had
defined
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
don't
say,
your
honor
that
they
have
to
be
expressed
in
explicit
findings.
we
have
made
the
point
throughout
this
case
that
the
fact
that
they
did
not
make
explicit
findings
is
highly
significant.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
that
is
part
of
our
basic
point,
but
somewhere,
this
has
to
be
determined.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
and
as
i
understand
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
a
question
that
they
have
made
that
in
the
sense
of
it
--
of
it
being
a
necessarily
implied
or
even
a
permissively
implied
finding
on
the
board
of
congress,
they
have
said
that,
may
it
please
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
they
haven't
said
as
clearly
as
your
honor
has
said
it
here
and
that's
one
of
our
points.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
they
have
not
said
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir,
this
is
a
part
of
our
argument.
it's
certainly
a
part
of
our
argument.
we
think
that
what
congress
did
when
they
were
faced
with
the
president's
message
and
with
the
other
request
that
there
be
consideration
given
to
a
broad
public
accommodations
law
of
this
time
was
to
cast
about,
to
find
some
constitutional
basis
for
it.
we
think
that
legislative
history
of
nothing
else
shows
a
considerable
amount
of
doubt
as
to
the
proper
constitutional
basis.
we
know
that
respectable
authorities,
eminent
attorneys,
and
professors,
and
judges
urge
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
some
the
thirteenth
amendment,
and
then
others,
the
commerce
clause.
we
know
that
this
act
embraces
not
just
the
commerce
clause,
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
extent
that
it
refers
in
section
201
(2)
(d)
to
state
action.
it's
rather
unusual
to
have
a
commerce
clause
statute
combine
with
a
--
a
statute
under
another
section
of
the
constitutional
act
of
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
makes
it
even
more
difficult
to
say
that
congress
made
the
specific
finding
or
determination
that
your
honor
just
suggested
because
to
the
extent
that
they
apply
the
statute
to
these
restaurants
that
are
in
those
sense
using
interstate
food
but
they
have
state
action
in
some
way
involved,
certainly
the
finding
doesn't
apply.
we
think
that
what
they
did
was
find
two
separate
lines
of
authority
and
they've
--
legislative
history
is
replete
with
evidence
of
this.
first
they
had
wickard
versus
filburn.
they
had
that
and
it'd
been
talked
about
for
years.
articles
had
been
written
about
it,
as
soon
as
they've
been
called
a
judicial
auditing
which
was
correct,
that
it
was
an
unusual
factual
situation
legally
it
was
correct,
it
was
an
auditing.
they
had
that,
but
then
they
had
the
labor
board
at
cases
and
they
can't
be
any
questions
that
they
put
their
primary
reliance
in
congress
on
the
labor
board
cases
and
the
labor
board,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
of
course,
picked
up
and
use
the
terms
affecting
commerce.
every
question
had
to
be
found
to
affect
commerce.
that
is
--
it
was
a
question
of
representation
affecting
commerce
or
an
unfair
labor
practice
affecting
commerce.
and
with
all
due
respect
for
the
solicitor
general
is
to
what
the
board
actually
does,
they
actually
make
an
inference
finally
in
most
cases
but
it's
not
a
summit,
through
that
the
board
does
not
make
the
inquiry.
i
have
here
a
copy
of
the
form
issued
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
our
form
501
which
is
the
charge
that
one
starts
a
case
within
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
basis
of
the
charge
is
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
charged
are
unfair
labor
practices
affecting
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
they've
determinate
it
in
every
case.
now
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i'm
not
sure
that
i
entirely
follow
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
think
i
understand
it.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
that
they
have
either
found
--
and
we
don't
say
that
they
have
to
be
spelled
out
findings
in
a
preamble
but
in
some
way
the
act
has
to
unequivocally
show
this
is
what
they
determined,
that
these
local
activities
as
was
true
in
wickard
versus
filburn,
these
local
activities
have
got
to
be
controlled,
they're
not
commerce
and
prima
facie,
we
have
no
control
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
selection
of
customer.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
our
position
is,
that
the
act
does
neither
of
those
things
and
it
must
be
one
or
the
other.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
the
courts
can
certainly
be
used
to
determine
whether
something
affects
commerce,
may
please
your
honor,
but
the
courts
are
not
permitted
to
do
that
here.
in
this
case,
if
the
--
because
the
court
is
required
to
find
an
effect
on
the
commerce
if
in
the
individual
case,
food
has
moved
in
the
past
across
state
lines.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir,
but
it's
post
in
the
past.
may
i
illustrate
why
i
think
this
past
tense
is
rather
significant,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
rather
significant
because
of
the
statute
itself.
in
the
section
that
we
are
talking
about
is
to
restaurants,
and
bear
in
mind,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
not
arguing
the
hotel
case
or
picture
showcase,
or
anything
else,
just
a
restaurant
case.
restaurants
are
treated
separately
in
this
act,
it
test
as
separate
and
the
whole
legislative
background
is
--
is
distinguishable
as
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
show
in
a
few
minutes.
but
in
the
case
of
restaurants,
they
have
put
it
in
these
terms
--
that
the
act
--
that
the
operations
of
a
restaurant
affect
commerce.
if
the
food
which
it
serves
has
moved
in
commerce.
once
moved
in
commerce,
it
may
never
move
again
and
there
may
never
be
anymore
food.
now,
in
section
3
which
deals
with
motion
pictures
and
theaters,
these
establishments
are
said
to
affect
commerce,
if
it
customarily
presents
films,
performances,
and
so
forth
which
moved
in
commerce.
now
that's
a
current
movement.
the
man
who's
operating
the
picture
show
is
now
regularly
and
customarily
showing
films
that
reaching
through
state
lines,
across
state
lines,
an
entirely
different
thing
from
the
factual
situation
and
the
restaurant
situation.
for
example,
suppose
we
had
a
restaurant,if
i
may
use
a
hypothetical,
i
have
no
exact
case,
but
if
we
had
restaurant
that
let's
say
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
for
many
years,
it
has
featured
as
its
main
specialty
virginia
ham
and
the
proprietor
has
grown
everything
else
that
he
serves
in
a
truck
garden
in
his
backyard.
now,
some
prior
to
july
of
1964,
while
there
is
an
entire
smoke
house
full
of
ham
supply
for
a
year,
he
stops
buying
any
further
hams
from
virginia.
he
buys
from
that
point
on
only
north
carolina
hams.
if
that
man
continued
to
serve,
the
virginia
hams
in
his
north
carolina
restaurant,
it
would
come
squarely
under
the
statute.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i'm
saying,
that
this
is
one
of
the
issues.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i'm
saying
may
it
please
your
honor
and
don't
mean
the
equivocal
as
the
way
we
put
it,
that
when
you
view
this
as
a
legislative
presumption
and
that's
what
it
is,
a
conclusive
presumption
that
this
affects
commerce,
that
certainly,
you
can
illustrate
that
it
--
that
the
presumption
would
not
be
valid
in
many
instances,
and
if
it
is
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
the
trial
court
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
think
it
says
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
think
the
statute
says
that.
i
don't
say
that
it's
--
i
don't
consider
it
says
that
in
the
sense,
it
makes
that
finding
and
that
shows
an
effect
on
commerce.
that's
what
the
statute
says,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
and
only
on
that
account.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
cases
first,
we
know
of
no
case
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
context
where
there
has
not
been
a
finding
that
the
particular
matter
regulated
affects
commerce
in
the
sense
of
future
commerce
prospective
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
the
point
that
we're
making,
may
it
please
the
court,
whereas
in
the
labor
board
cases,
the
attention
that
has
been
given
to
the
movement
of
goods
across
state
lines
in
reaching
the
employer
in
certain
cases
of
which
reliance
was
one
and
there
are
many,
many
others
has
always
been
used
as
a
basis
for
inferring
from
a
past
movement
of
goods
that
there
would
be
a
future
movement
of
goods
to
this
employer
and
therefore
a
strike
or
any
other
disturbance
at
the
plant
would
result
in
an
injury
to
commerce.
if
i
may
read
just
a
short
passage
from
one
of
the
cases,
i
think
i
can
illustrate
the
point
that
we
are
trying
to
make.
in
the
denver
building
council
case,
this
court
stated
that
any
widespread
application
of
the
practices
that
they
were
dealing
with
there,
might
well
result,
future,
it
might
well
result
in
substantially
decreasing
the
influx
of
materials
into
colorado.
in
the
brandeis
case
which
has
been
cited
in
every
memorandum
that's
been
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
or
the
department
of
justice
in
this
case,
the
court
stated,
“clearly,
if
a
strike
of
the
employees
in
the
store
should
lead
to
the
closing
of
the
doors
and
stop
the
selling
of
merchandise,
the
flow
of
supplies
from
outside
the
state
would
soon
stop.”
the
effect
that
is
on
commerce
would
be
close
and
substantial.
i'm
saying,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
you
could
have
a
restaurant
under
this
statute
that
might
never
again
make
any
use
of
any
food
that
crossed
state
lines
and
therefore
it
might
not
as
all
affect
interstate
commerce
at
all.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
no
sir,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
because
the
--
the
lower
court
has
given
no
authority
here
except
to
apply
the
definition
of
affect
commerce
that
has
been
exclusively
set
out.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
i'm
assuming
the
restaurant
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
i'm
assuming
a
restaurant
that
presently
serves
food
that
at
one
time
move
across
state
lines.
you
see
we
have
--
there's
no
limit
to
how
far
back
it
may
go,
may
it
please
your
honor.
in
the
senate
judiciary
committee,
the
attorney
general
testified
that
this
would
apply.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
after
it
used
up
the
virginia
ham
that
could,
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i'm
afraid
i'm
enough
to
making
my
position
clear
to
the
court,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
talking
in
terms
now
of
what
congress'
power
might
have
been,
just
for
the
purpose
of
argument
let
us
assume,
i
don't
think
they
have
this
kind
of
a
legislative
background
but
let
us
assume
that
they
had
enough
before
them
just
to
say
that
all
racial
exclusion
in
restaurants
in
the
whole
united
states
has
some
kind
accumulative
effect
on
commerce
and
therefore
we
will
proscribe
all
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
let's
say
that
they
had
done
that.
now,
they
didn't
do
that,
they
didn't
do
it.
instead,
they
have
purported
to
apply
it
only
to
the
restaurants
whose
operations
affect
commerce.
now
those
words
have
to
mean
something
and
what
congress
has
said
is
that
in
every
case,
one
meaning
that
has
to
be
attributed
to
them
is,
that
--
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
they
serve
once
moved
in
commerce.
i
say
that
in
the
labor
board
cases,
that
past
movement
across
state
lines
in
reaching
the
employer
was
purely
evidentiary.
it
was
never
a
matter
of
law.
the
board
was
permitted
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule
in
all
those
cases
to
conclude
since
last
year
the
employer
used
materials
across
state
lines,
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
next
year,
he
might
do
the
same
thing
and
therefore
a
strike
of
labor
dispute
might
interrupt
the
flow.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
of
course,
the
board
could
only
make
it
where
it
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
your
honor
and
if
you
had
substantial
evidence
to
the
contrary
if
i
may
just
make
one
point,
then
the
board
would
--
would
make
it
in
the
other
way
too.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
be
factious
in
saying
this
but
i
wish
to
repeat,
i
only
have
a
restaurant
case.
i'm
only
talking
about
a
restaurant.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
if
the
legislative
history
doesn't
support
whatever
they
did
as
to
restaurants
and
surely
we
should
prevail.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
in
answering
that,
your
honor,
may
i
make
a
comparison
between
the
two
tests,
one
of
them
is
the
travelers
test.
i
have
never
contended
that
there
is
not
enough
legislative
history
to
support
that
test.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
certainly.
i
certainly
would
have
to
concede
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
in
that
particular
class,
the
50%
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
the
interstate
travelers.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
would
say
that
the
congress
could
easily,
in
this
particular
legislative
record,
have
had
enough
evidence
to
make
that
finding.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
think
on
the
interstate
traveler
approach
that
is
the
restaurant
located
on
the
big
highway
that
gets
the
bulk
of
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
the
only
importance.
congress
wrote
it
into
the
act
as
one
of
the
types
of
restaurants
that
would
be
covered.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
i
intended
to
include
that
in
the
agreement
on
the
first
point.
i
think
it's
an
extension
of
certain
rational
of
number
of
cases
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
i
can
conceive
of
having
an
argument
on
particular
case
but
certainly,
i
think
there's
some
legislative
background
for
concluding
that.
but
may
it
please
the
court,
in
reference
to
the
question
that
was
put
just
a
minute
ago
by
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
in
this
legislative
record
that
has
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
movement
of
goods
across
state
lines
and
the
impact
on
that
movement
because
of
discrimination.
i
can't
find
anything
in
the
legislative
record
in
--
rather
show
at
time
it
was
available
to
brief
this
case,
we
undertook
to
find
some
reference
to
food
moving
across
state
lines
and
being
in
some
way
affected
by
a
racial
selection
policy,
and
we
are
confident
that
none
exist
because
certainly,
solicitor
general
would
have
called
our
attention
to
it.
there's
ample
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
that
this
type
of
a
policy
may
impede
travel
where
the
establishment
is
on
a
traveled
route,
but
we
suggest
that
the
same
is
not
true
as
to
the
food
test
and
it's
not
merely
a
matter
of
what
congress
did
undertake
to
do.
it's
also
that
they
did
not
have
any
basis
on
which
to
do
that,
which
the
solicitor
general
claims
they
did.
now
we
don't
think
that's
what
they
really
did.
what
we
really
think
they
were
doing
was
making
an
equation
between
this
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they
were
just
legislating
a
presumption
that
has
been
evidentiary
in
those
cases.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
it
would
necessarily
be
the
common
experience
of
this
court
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
what
experience
tells
the
court
but
i
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
certainly
don't
thing
anything
has
been
submitted
that
would
show
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
your
honor,
may
we
make
it
entirely
clear.
we
are
not
in
any
sense
urging
that
congress
does
not
have
great
power
that
the
gentlemen
that
in
the
congress
that
favored
this
legislation,
we're
not
entirely
conscientious,
sincere,
and
very
intelligent
americans.
we
just
feel
that
this
act
was
not
enacted
in
the
usual
manner
at
all.
we
don't
believe
that
the
most
of
the
members
of
congress
had
any
occasion
to
really
study
the
impact
of
the
commerce
clause
cases.
we
can
with
the
legislative
history
on
it,
it
does
exist.
your
honor
put
the
--
hypothetical
if
we
didn't
have
any
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir
and
certainly,
we
don't
contend
that
you
have
to
have
legislative
findings
in
all
legislation
however.
if
you
do
not
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
in
some
way,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
think
that
there
must
be
someway
to
demonstrate,
that
the
local
activity
that
on
its
phase
is
not
within
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause
comes
within
that
power.
we
don't
think
that
this
court
can
presume
that
congress
is
always
right.
we
think,
for
example
that
there
–
well,
it's
--
it
has
not
been
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
no
sir,
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
urge
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
we're
not
dealing
with
this
in
the
sense
of
a
police
power
of
a
state.
now
in
the
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
i
confess
to
--
your
honor,
that
i'm
shocked
to
know
that
it's
a
police
power.
i
thought
it
was
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
in
every
case
that
i
know
of,
there
has
been
a
relationship
to
interstate
commerce
that
has
been
demonstrated
in
some
manner.
the
filburn
case
is
not
in
point
at
all
or
in
the
sullivan
case.
the
local
--
the
regulation
of
sullivan
was
absolutely
essential
regulation
just
as
the
regulation
of
filburn
was
to
carry
out
the
main
purpose
of
the
act
which
was
a
commercial
purpose.
that's
not
true
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
it
has
no
principle
interstate
commerce
purpose.
it's
--
the
part
we
are
talking
about
is
the
--
is
all
that
they
have.
now,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
legislation
that
has
taken
these
local
activities
that
have
never
been
regulated
before
on
any
such
basis
is
this
under
the
commerce
clause,
where
congress
didn't
make
findings.
in
the
carolene
products
case,
may
it
please
your
honor,
as
we
understand
that
case,
the
findings
the
court
was
saying
was
not
necessary
--
were
not
related
to
any
affect
on
commerce.
they
were
dealing
with
the
apparent
finding
or
conclusion
reached
by
congress
that
filled
milk
was
just
deleterious
and
they
didn't
make
any
express
finding
in
this
court,
so
it's
not
necessary,
we
don't
question
that.
but
this
court
is
now
looking
at
this
act
which
doesn't
say
we
pass
it
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
don't
–
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
it,
when
it
sales
affects
commerce.
now
if
--
the
question
is,
since
it
chooses
to
use
the
terms
affect
commerce,
has
it
been
limited
to
those
activities
that
can
be
reasonably
said
to
affect
commerce,
and
we
think
not.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
in
many
cases,
it
would
not
be,
and
those
cases
that
are
covered,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
no
sir,
i
don't
say
that.
i
haven't
got
the
authority
for
that.
i
think
that
if
the
substantial
part,
i
think
we
concede
that
is
$70,000
out
of
this
particular
restaurants
to
us
is
substantial.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
and
the
government
concede
the
statute
covers
us
and
that
we're
in
violation.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i've
never
had
occasion
to
take
that
position,
but
we've
never
questioned,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
i
don't
think
then
the
question
of
that
is
substantial.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
think
that
congress'
power
cannot
be
rested
on
a
connection
with
interstate
commerce
which
is
related
solely
and
exclusively
to
pass
movements
in
commerce,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we're
not
arguing
the
coming
to
rest
doctrine,
may
it
please
the
court,
we're
not
arguing
that.
we
want
to
make
that
clear
in
the
very
beginning.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir,
we
are
talking
about
burdens
on
the
commerce.
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
couldn't
prove
that,
your
honor.
the
record
clearly
shows
we're
under
the
act.
we're
under
the
act.
they
concede
we're
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
mean,
in
the
statute
this
must
be
shown.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
we've
showed,
we've
showed
we
come
under
the
statute.
i
don't
--
please
don't
let
me
leave
the
court
in
any
doubt
about
our
position.
we
are
under
the
statute.
we
are
not
complying
whether
it
does
cover
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
no
sir,
no
sir.
we
don't
raise
that
point.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
an
adequacy
of
hearing?
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
i
put
it
this
way,
may
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
if
you
were
to
equate
this
exactly
with
wickard
versus
filburn,
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
whether
the
particular
activity
we
are
talking
about
had
an
effect
on
commerce.
of
course,
before
mr.
filburn
was
penalized,
they
had
to
have
a
hearing,
but
we
don't
think
it
can
be
equated
with
it
at
all.
we
don't
think
that
the
background
of
the
statutes
that
matters
dealt
with
some
law
or
that
statute
is
even
drafted
in
the
similar
manner.
now
to
equate
it
with
the
national
labor
relations
act,
then
we
reach
the
point
made
by
your
honor
and
we
do
contend
that
we
had
that
of
a
hearing
in
an
opportunity
to
show
we
don't
affect
commerce,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
and
the
statute
does
not
do
this,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
thank
you
for
that
question.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
that's
right.
we
do
say
that,
your
honor.
that's
why
we
--
may
i
say
this
that
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
that's
right.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir,
in
the
light
of
common
experience.
now,
i
think
that
if
i
may
sum
up
that
question
in
relation
to
one
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
a
little
while
ago,
we've
never
said
that
we
think
findings
are
necessary
in
and
off
themselves
in
form
of
findings,
but
where
the
matter
that
congress
is
dealing
with
does
not
have
a
rational
relationship
to
the
regulation
in
common
experience
then
certainly
something
must
be
shown,
to
show
there
is
a
connection.
for
example,
in
the
statute
that
was
involved
in
united
states
versus
tot
which
this
court
held
violated
constitutional
rights
on
another
reason.
the
statute
itself
made
it
a
federal
offense
for
a
convicted
felon
to
be
in
possession
of
a
pistol
which
it
moved
in
or
found
which
had
moved
in
on
interstate
commerce.
so
far
as
i
know,
unless
the
court
could
have
had
knowledge
of
its
own
from
some
source
that
this
was
a
proper
thing
for
the
congress
to
deal
with.
it
wouldn't
have
been
upheld,
but
there
were.
there
was
a
legislative
history
and
there
was
a
--
the
justice
department
decision.
fbi
showed
that
this
was
a
very
important
problem,
this
matter
of
transporting
firearms
illegally
and
so
as
to
reach
criminals.
now
what
we
are
saying
is
that,
unless
the
legislative
history
shows
a
relationship
and
you
then
have
to
fall
back
on
common
experience
and
in
common
experience,
there
is
no
relationship
here
between
the
matter
regulated
and
an
affect
on
commerce.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
i
have
to
carry
it
one
step
further
if
i
may
your
honor
and
that
is
to
a
burden
on
commerce
or
an
interference
or
even
the
change
of
question
--
of
changing
the
flow
or
shifting
the
flow.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
under
the
statute,
i
don't
understand
that
there's
any
place
to
determine
that
purchases
are
decreased.
that's
the
very
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
it.
under
this
statute
whether
you
--
whether
it
would
affect
the
dec
--
affect
your
purchases
in
volume,
increase
them
or
decrease
them
it
doesn't
any
difference?
you'd
still
be
covered
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
on
which
congress
could
have
placed
that
determination
and
certainly,
i
don't
think
it's
a
common
experience.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
thought
[inaudible]
--
that
argument
or
at
least
express
no
willingness
to
stand
on
here.
i
take
it
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
perhaps
not
abandoned,
but
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
is
questioning
whether
congress
could
have
concluded
on
the
basis
of
whatever
was
before
it.
that
racial
discrimination
in
all
of
the
restaurants
all
over
the
country,
just
in
and
of
itself
just
has
an
effect
on
commerce
and
without
any
of
reference
to
the
operation
of
the
individual
restaurant,
they
just
proscribe.
is
that
the
argument?
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
i
did
not
understand
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
--
i
did
not
understand
them
to
press
that
argument
but
to
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
but
that's
cleared
up
when
i
was
through
the
[inaudible]
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
can
say
this.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
your
honor
on
this
broader
argument,
that
has
been
suggested,
we
would
then
be
faced
with
determining,
did
congress
make
any
such
determination
and
did
it
mean
to
apply
the
act
on
that
broader
basis.
we
think
at
the
outset
that
it
didn't,
but
if
they
are
seeing
in
effect,
they
could
have
done
it
and
therefore
they
could
have
done
it
on
a
more
restricted
basis,
then
we
say
there
is
no
basis
or
whatever
to
have
reach
that
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
restaurants.
now,
whatever
affect
the
demonstrations
of
1963
had
and
i'm
perfectly
frank
to
say
to
the
court
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
common
experience
of
this
court
or
people
generally
will
permit
those
demonstrations
to
be
given
any
great
weight.
if
any
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
solicitor
general
as
the
economic
effect
have
any
weight,
there
must
be
the
overall
economic
arguments
of
moving
business
back
and
forth
between
the
states
and
removing
what
he
refers
to
in
his
artificial
barriers.
certainly,
those
demonstrations
created
entirely
different
problem
from
what
has
existed
before
or
sense
and
certainly
they
were
not
dealt
with
by
the
congress
has
an
effort
to
avoid
further
demonstrations.
they
--
no
effort
made,
for
example
to
deal
with
the
demonstrations
themselves
at
all
and
there
certainly
was
no
determination
as
to
what
call
was
the
demonstrations.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
certainly
in
that
general
sense,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
(voice
overlap)
there
are
plenty
of
testimony
that
effect
but
i
meant
in
relation
to
restaurants
particularly.
well,
certainly
you
had
it
in
connection
with
the
–-
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
most
of
them
were
restaurants
and
the
department
stores
and
variety
stores
that
had
(voice
overlap)
that
segregated
counters
but
had
mixed
trade.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
your
honor,
the
courts
have
been
taking
judicial
notice
quite
a
number
of
things
for
a
long
time
and
certainly
anything
has
reason
of
that,
we
wouldn't
feel
it
was
unfair
for
the
court
to
consider
it
because
we
have
some
knowledge
that
the
court
knew
it.
however,
on
this
broad
approach
that
has
been
suggested
which
i
don't
believe
has
ever
been
argued
by
the
solicitor
general
before
and
i'd
like
very
much
to
deal
with
it
in
the
supplemental
briefs
that
this
unusual
procedure
of
the
court
has
permitted
us
has
contemplated,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
that
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
i
don't
believe
that
there's
anything
on
which
we
could
say
that
the
congress
could
have
made
any
such
finding
in
this
statute
when
it
clearly
undertook
and
purported
and
said
to
all
the
world,
it
applies
to
only
what
affects
commerce
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
what
is
suggested
by
your
honor
on
that
is
that
it
really
isn't
a
case
by
case
basis
at
all.
so
absolutely,
overall,
aggregate
effect
type
theory
and
i
don't
think
that
it
did
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
they
provided
in
every
case
for
hearing
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
they
have
one
or
two
tests
have
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
that's
true,
except
the
violation.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
no,
it's
not.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
it
doesn't
turn
out
to
be,
your
honor,
we
think
the
legislative
history
shows
what
it
intended
to
be,
it
does
not
turn
out
to
be.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes,
exactly.
i
think
people
ought
to
have
that
right.
i
can't
quibble
with
the
wisdom
of
congress.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
think
everything
that
your
honor
has
stated
is
compatible
with
our
position
except
that
i
don't
say
that
since
they
haven't
found
a
hearing,
it
cannot
be
upheld
on
that
basis.
the
point
that
we
were
making
is
to
a
hearing
is
that
one
of
the
authorities
they
relied
on
was
reliance
fuel
and
there
was
a
hearing,
and
there
was
substantial
evidence.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
that's
the
point
that
we
--
we
didn't
want
to
get
the
--
we
tried
to
keep
the
two
theories
separately.
it
seems
to
us
it's
entirely
clear
that
there
are
two
approaches,
the
wickard
versus
filburn
approach
and
the
reliance
approach
and
the
reliance
approach
involves
a
hearing.
so
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
and
the
third
approach
is
the
one
that
has
never
been
followed
to
our
knowledge
in
anything
of
this
nature
before
and
we
will
brief
that,
i
have
not
in
the
interested
discussing
the
interstate
commerce
aspects
stated
the
facts
of
our
case
to
add
a
few
facts.
i
realize
that
it's
laid
in
the
case
to
be
making
them
clear,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that,
this
particular
restaurant
is
11
blocks
from
an
interstate
highway,
18
blocks
from
the
railroad
station,
22
blocks
from
the
bus
station.
it
is
completely
of
by
itself
as
far
as
interstate
activity
is
concerned.
these
people,
the
appellees
know
most
of
their
customers
by
sight,
they
are
regular
customers,
they
see
them,
they
are
basically
family
and
business
people.
i
think
it's
rather
important
that
this
is
true
because
it
is
not
a
case
such
as
a
howard
johnson's
restaurant
would
present.
now
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
the
biggest
meal
is
certainly
lunch
time,
your
honor.
they
have
an
evening
meal.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes.
well,
people
get
in
their
cars
and
drive
all
the
way
out
they
are
from
downtown
birmingham
area.
yes,
sir,
it's
rather
the
popular
place.
now
--
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
it's
not
small
in
the
sense,
that
it's
a
little
counter.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
it
will
set
roughly
200
people
and
it
--
it
serves
500,000
meals
to
much
less
people
than
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
they
[inaudible]
that's
right.
now,
may
it
please
the
court
on
this
matter
of
whether
the
court
below
should
maintain
the
injunction,
now
we
have
taken
the
position
throughout
this
litigation
that
the
court
below
was
correct.
we
do
not
have
a
great
deal
of
time
left
on
the
point
but
may
i
--
in
conclusion,
call
attention
to
facts
that
relate
particularly
to
the
procedural
aspects
of
the
case.
there
was
never
any
question
that
the
appellees
were
covered
by
the
act,
at
least
their
complaint
undertook
to
show
that
and
certainly
by
the
time
of
the
hearing,
this
was
shown.
it
has
never
been
contended
they
are
not
covered
by
the
act.
in
fact,
it
has
been
stipulated
that
they
are.
so
they
were
in
a
violation
of
a
statute
which
had
immediate
application
to
them,
perhaps
not
immediate
penalty
but
it
had
an
immediate
application.
two
days
earlier,
the
department
of
justice
had
filed
a
suit
in
the
same
court
against
15
restaurants
in
one
case,
lumping
them
all
together
and
asking
for
a
joint
trial
as
to
all
of
them
on
this
matter
of
no
additional
expense
that
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general.
we
think
that
this
suggests
a
reason
why
the
remedy
afforded
under
the
act
would
not
be
as
efficient
and
as
convenient
as
the
one
that
was
available
to
us.
now
as
far
as
precedent
is
concerned
for
the
injunctive
feature
in
the
case
of
stafford
versus
wallace
which
has
been
relied
on
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
and
may
i
believe,
it
was
mentioned
this
morning
those
are
federal
statute
to
regulate
stockyards
and
there
is
hearing
provided
before
the
secretary
of
commerce
or
agriculture,
excuse
me,
secretary
of
agriculture.
whatever
he
rule
was
--
could
be
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
review
and
there
was
no
penalty
just
as
the
case
in
this
statute,
there
was
no
penalty
until
after
you
have
failed
to
comply
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture's
ruling.
i
think
the
case
was
very
close
to
the
present
case
and
the
injunction
was
held
proper
by
this
court
via,
wickard
versus
filburn,
of
course
as
already
been
mentioned
there
is
authority.
most
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
but
not
this
morning
where
cases
dealing
with
the
time
honored
rule
that
federal
courts
generally
just
do
not
interfere
with
the
administration
of
justice
in
state
courts
unless
absolutely
necessary.
that
point,
we
do
not
make
any
--
raise
any
question
about
it.
that
is
the
only
explanation
we
know
about
the
city
of
gwinnett
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
close
our
presentation
of
this
case
with
--
by
simply
reminding
the
court
that
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
any
effort
to
restrict
congress'
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
or
local
matters
that
truly
affect.
but
if
federal
system
is
to
be
maintained,
then
congress
cannot
have
under
the
commerce
powers
broad
discretion
as
states
have
under
the
police
power
and
we
don't
believe
that
historical
precedents
show
that
they
have.
now,
we
do
not
urge
any
restriction
of
any
of
any
line
of
authority
that
exists
today,
but
it's
just
plain,
i'm
sure
to
every
justice
on
this
court,
that
this
does
represent
an
area
for
which
there
is
no
immediate
authority
and
for
which
there
is
no
really
close
analogy.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
everyone
of
them
are
holdings
relating
to
a
statute
where
the
essential
and
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
regulate
the
transportation
of
goods
in
commerce
which
was
true
in
the
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
don't
have
to
quarrel
with
any
of
those
cases
your
honor.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
don't
question
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir,
but
they
were
regulating
the
goods
themselves
or
the
activities
related
directly
to
the
goods.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
let's
just
bare
point
we
wish
we
have
been
able
to
make,
apparently
we
have
not,
your
honor.
this
is
not
related
to
the
case.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
if
they're
regulate
it
to
cooking
of
the
food,
i
think
you
would
have
parallel
that
would
be
applicable,
but
here,
we're
regulating
something
that
is
totally
separate
and
apart
from
the
use
of
the
food
and
the
use
of
the
food
is
purely
incidental,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
least,
that's
our
view
of
it
and
we're
not
in
the
position
to
urge
it
against
your
honor.
we
should
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
cases
you'd
have
to
overrule,
your
honor,
to
decide
this
case
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well,
we
would
hope
enough
supplemental
brief
to
persuade
your
honor
further.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
my
answer
is
yes
because
i
understand
that
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
(voice
overlap)
if
this
court
decided
the
case
in
our
favor
on
the
merits,
it
would
remain
it
to
the
lower
court
with
orders
to
vacate
the
injunction
and
of
declaratory
judgment
force
anyway.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
we
are
here.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes,
sir
and
i
think
the
proper
result
would
be,
if
the
government
prevailed
on
that
point
would
be
to
send
it
to
the
lower
court
for
declaratory
judgment
anyway
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
say
yes.
we
would
have
an
objection
to
that.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor
and
i'm
not
saying
that
i
know
that
it's
not.
i
just
don't
know
either
way,
your
honor.
i've
not
known
of
an
instance
where
it
has
been.
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
well
i
don't
have
any
question
that
--
i
thought
that
the
question
was
asked
in
the
context
of
the
demonstrations
of
last
year.
we
didn't
have
any
this
year
so
i
don't
know
--
mr.
robert
mcdavid
smith
yes,
sir.
well
i'm
sure
that
--
that
the
ordinance
which
has
been
there
for
many,
many
years
state
statutes
still
in
effect
would
be
applied,
but
whether
they
in
this
context,
i
do
not
know
of
any
cases.
