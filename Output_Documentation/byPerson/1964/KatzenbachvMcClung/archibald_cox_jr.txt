mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
second
case
involving
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
comes
here
on
the
government’s
appeal
from
a
decree
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
northern
district
of
alabama,
temporarily
enjoining
the
acting
attorney
general
from
taking
any
steps
to
enforce
title
ii
against
the
appellees.
the
facts
are
simple
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal,
they
are
undisputed.
appellees
operate
a
restaurant
in
birmingham,
alabama
specializing
in
barbecue
meats.
they
seek
no
transient
trade
by
advertising
and
so
far
as
they
know,
they
serve
no
interstate
guests.
in
the
12-month
period
prior
to
july
1,
1964,
the
appellees
purchased
about
$150,000
worth
of
food.
included
in
that
sum
was
about
$70,000
worth
of
meat
which
was
purchased
from
the
hormel
company
at
its
birmingham,
alabama
plant.
all
the
meat
sold
at
that
plant,
about
40%
of
the
appellees
total
purchases
of
food
came
from
other
states
so
that
it
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
the
district
court
found
that
the
appellees,
not
only
practiced
racial
segregation
at
their
restaurant
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
--
of
the
title
ii,
but
since
its
enactment,
they
have
consistently
continued
and
will
continue
to
violate
the
act.
prior
to
july
31,
1964,
the
department
of
justice
had
never
heard
of
the
appellees
or
of
their
restaurant.
there's
been
no
investigation
and
no
specific
threat
to
enforce
compliance
on
the
part
of
their
restaurant.
on
that
day
nevertheless,
the
appellees
commenced
this
action
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
title
ii.
they
alleged
two
kinds
of
irreparable
injury.
first,
they
said
that
actions
to
enforce
title
ii
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
all
individual
negroes
which
subject
them
to
the
burdens
inconvenience
of
expenses
of
litigation,
and
the
aggravation
of
such
burdens
by
a
potential
multiplicity
of
suits.
second,
they
--
and
the
court
below
found,
that
the
actual
enforcement
of
the
act
that
it's
a
compliance
with,
would
subject
them
to
irreparable
injury
through
a
lost
of
customers
and
lost
profits.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
upon
two,
essentially
two
grounds.
one
was
that
the
court
had
no
equity
jurisdiction.
the
point
was
argued
on
several
grounds
that
here
we
insist
upon
it
in
the
form
of
the
big
no
injury
against
which
they're
entitled
to
be
protected
by
injunction.
we
also
argued
in
the
court
below
and
of
course
argue
here
that
if
the
merits
were
reached,
the
act
is
constitutional
as
applied
to
the
appellees.
the
district
court
ruled
against
the
government
on
both
grounds
and
issued
an
injunction
temporarily
enjoining
the
acting
attorney
general
from
taking
any
steps
to
enforce
the
act
against
the
appellees.
mr.
justice
black
granted
a
stay
on
september
23rd
and
probable
notice
of
jurisdiction
was
set
forth
in
the
order
announced
by
the
chief
justice
a
moment
ago.
in
this
court,
we
press
the
same
two
arguments.
while
we
would
welcome
a
broad
ruling
on
the
constitutionality
of
title
ii
as
applied
to
the
appellee's
restaurant
or
any
other
restaurant,
the
district
court's
assumption
of
jurisdiction
here
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
under
these
circumstances
disturbs
us
so
profoundly
in
its
implication
for
the
future
administration
of
this
and
other
statutes
that
we
do
feel
compelled
to
insist
upon
that
point
as
one
of
two
grounds
for
reversal.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
at
the
appropriate
time
for
that
–
the
department
really
didn't
have
any
knowledge
about
the
restaurant.
there
was
some
argument
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
i
suppose
we
could
have
accepted
them,
we
didn't
at
that
stage.
indeed
in
the
court
below,
there
was
some
argument,
curious
situation
really
developed.
the
appellees
were
arguing
the
statute
applies
to
us
were
in
violation
and
the
department
was
insisting
that
the
violation
hadn't
been
proved.
now
i
don't
take
that
position
here.
i
do
say
that
except
the
findings
below
and
as
the
statute
applies
for
them,
but
we
just
don't
feel
able
to
waive
this
point.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
suppose
maybe
i
don't
welcome
it
enough,
mr.
justice
stewart
to
be
willing
to
waive
it.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
it
could
have
been
done
here.
it
is
important
to
us
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
very
real
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
i'd
be
making
the
same
argument
about
it,
sued
for
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
we
would
have
objected
to
the
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
i'm
going
to
argue
here.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
don't
recall
any
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
in
mendoza
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
wickard
and
filburn,
there
clearly
was
some
penalty.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
but
still
there
is
some
penalty.
there
is
some
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
point
was
raised
there
that
--
the
small
penalty
but
there
was
something
that
happened.
here
literally
there
is
absolutely
no
occasion
for
these
appellees
to
have
taken
us
to
court.
there
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
i
don't
really
put
this
quite
in
terms
of
case
of
controversy.
i
think
that
for
the
action
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
be
appropriate
as
in
the
case
of
an
injunction
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
statute
that
there
must
be
some
showing
that
the
complainant
has
some
need
for
relief.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
that
the
last
point
of
the
rule
is
the
essence
of
it,
that
in
the
dealing
with
constitutional
problem
and
in
dealing
of
particularly
with
interference
with
the
normal
processes
of
law
enforcement
that
it's
not
appropriate
unless
there
is
some
occasion,
some
injury
to
the
complainant
that
entitled
him
to
go
to
court.
now
let
me
if
i
may
--
let
me
point
out
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
i
--
i
would
perhaps
have
to
put
it
in
somewhat
different
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i'd
argue
that
it
isn't
appropriate.
i
would
also,
perhaps
in
that
case,
argue
as
it
was
done
below
although
i
hadn't
thought
it
was
the
most
effective
argument
here
that
there
was
no
case
of
controversy.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
no.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
it's
only
i'm,
they
pressed
into
it.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
no.
i
was
being
asked
what
i
would
do
if
i
had
another
case
and
to
that
–
i
replied
to
the
question.
i
don't
have
to
argue
it.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
that's
right.
and
there
are
two
–
but
the
declaratory
judgment
has
injunction
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
but
if
that
is
a
point
we
raised,
i
would
--
as
i
said
about
a
moment
ago,
i
would
still
argue
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
case.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
i'm
really
getting
to
that
direction.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
at
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
or
no
jurisdiction
over
the
part.
i
think
the
argument
really
comes
to
that
it's
an
inappropriate
instance
for
a
court
to
intervene
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
situation
has
--
is
different
and
what
really
concerns
me
the
most
about
this
is
the
rule
that's
announced
below.
if
this
court
for
example
to
be
very
frankly
to
disapprove
that
rule
as
--
to
make
plan
that
it
didn't
agree
with
it,
i
would
have
no
objection
to
the
court
going
on.
i'd
welcome
there
going
on
and
dealing
with
the
merits.
i
think
they'd
have
the
power
to
do
it.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
that's
--
thereby
our
argument
is
precisely.
i
was
tried
first
to
state
the
absence
--
utter
absence
of
need,
on
the
party
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
don't
understand
that
one
is
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment,
whatever
he
wants.
i
think
the
courts
have
issued
--
exercised
a
great
deal
of
discretion
as
to
when
it's
appropriate
to
enter
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
if
i
might
have
just
a
minute
to
state
what
i
do
think
that
i
would
answer
a
great
many
of
these
questions.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
i'll
come
to
your
point.
i'm
attempting
to
go
at
it
directly
because
there's
really
no
disagreement
between
us,
mr.
justice
as
i
think
you
will
see.
the
situation
here
as
mr.
justice
black
said
a
moment
ago
is
one
in
which
all
the
appellees
are
asking
is
to
enjoin
the
government
from
someday
bringing
a
lawsuit
against
them,
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
there
is
no
--
i'll
point
out
several
things.
first,
that
the
statute
contains
no
provision
for
damages,
no
provision
for
criminal
prosecution,
no
provision
for
criminal
or
civil
penalty
and
i
tried
to
emphasize
in
my
discussion
of
the
statute
this
morning
that
it
is
limited
in
all
cases
to
preventive
relief.
second,
i
point
out
that
the
appellees
now
are
suffering
no
injury
or
loss
of
any
kind.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
statute
at
its
operation
injures
their
business
as
did
the
zoning
law
in
euclid
against
ambler
or
the
school
law
in
pierce
against
society
of
sisters
because
it
choose
the
market
or
discourages
customers.
they
don't
complain
that
any
customers
are
leaving
them
now
and
so
far
as
we
know,
they're
going
on
without
suffering
any
injury.
the
third
i
would
emphasize
as
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
brennan
here
that
this
is
a
statute
which
shows
a
good
deal
of
discrimination
in
what
suits
we
may
bring
and
what
suits
we
may
not
bring.
it
may
well
be
that
we
would
pursue
some
other
course
to
secure
compliance
in
this
case
or
in
other
cases.
fourth
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
the
way
the
injunction
or
for
that
matter,
the
declaration
won't
affect
the
private
individual.
he
could
go
ahead
and
bring
it
again,
bring
his
own
suit,
the
first
private
suit,
if
it
went
against
the
private
individual
would
have
i
suppose
some
effect
as
a
precedent,
just
as
much
effect
as
the
precedent
i
take
it
as
the
first
suit
against
the
attorney
general
would
have
and
no
more.
but
i
take
it
finally
that
the
expenses
of
defending
an
action
brought
by
the
attorney
general
are
no
greater
than
the
expenses
of
prosecuting
an
action
against
him.
indeed,
i
should
suppose
that
there
would
be
somewhat
less.
so
that
here,
what
we
have
is
simply
no
occasion
for
picking
a
quarrel
with
us.
well,
it
maybe
said
it
doesn't
hurt
the
government.
let
it
go
ahead
and
learn
to
defend
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
three
things
that
are
involved.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
an
established
principle
that
a
court
will
not
unnecessarily
decide
constitutional
questions.
that
was
a
principle,
the
importance
of
which
became
very
clear
during
the
1930
where
the
number
of
lower
courts
by
holding
acts
of
congress
unconstitutional
delayed
and
interfered
with
the
administration
of
important
laws,
postponed
their
effectiveness
for
two
or
three
years
while
the
issue
was
being
litigated.
this
is
of
the
utmost
importance
under
many
statutes.
i
take
it
would
be
under
this
statute
where
tremendously
important
to
be
part
of
it
is
achieving
a
voluntary
accommodation
and
adjustment
to
the
main
and
the
entertaining
of
suits
to
declare
the
act
unconstitutional
without
any
reason
increases
the
chance
that
it
will
be
so
held
unconstitutional.
now
i
suppose
that
reason
at
this
stage,
mr.
justice
black,
hardly
comes
into
play.
indeed
at
this
stage,
i
suppose
it
maybe
more
important
that
the
court
face
the
issue
and
i
couldn't
deny
that.
the
second
consideration
is
that
the
determination
of
what
case
is
to
litigant
–
to
litigate
is
an
important
part
of
the
administration
of
the
law
and
the
administration
of
justice
and
under
this
statute
as
justice
brennan
suggested,
there
are
alternative
ways
provided
of
going
at
the
question.
we
aren't
directed
to
litigate
every
case.
we
can't
afford
to
litigate
every
case
as
big
as
the
government
is
and
it's
important
that
the
ones
we
litigate
be
those
which
we
think
are
most
suited
for
litigation
in
the
sense
that
they
will
do
most
to
promote
universal
compliance
for
the
statute.
third,
i
confess
i
can't
see
anyway
except
by
drawing
a
somewhat
arbitrary
line
in
terms
of
appropriateness
for
saying
that
this
bill
was
correctly
entertained
by
the
district
court
and
entertaining
any
other
bill
by
anybody
else
who
says
that
the
statute
affects
him
or
entertaining
a
similar
bill
by
any
[inaudible]
and
challenging
it
on
constitutional
grounds.
indeed,
i
don't
know
why
it
should
stop
there.
why
shouldn't
it
be
declaratory
judgment
actions
to
find
out
whether
the
sherman
act
applies
to
a
particular
set
of
facts
and
thus
opening
the
door
wide.
now
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago,
mr.
justice
black,
those
considerations
apply
to
the
general
rule,
to
the
--
they
show
i
argue
for
the
wrongness
of
what
the
district
court
did.
when
the
case
is
here,
i
should
agree
that
the
situation
has
very
radically
changed.
i
don't
think
the
argument
i
make
applies
with
the
same
force
to
this
court.
i
had
only
that
i
do
what
that
rule
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
do
ask
this
court
to
disapprove
that
principle
somewhat
as
you've
indicated
a
moment
ago.
now
i'd
like
to
go
on
to
the
merits
of
the
case
taking
it
that
certainly
they
must
be
argued
and
submit
that
issue
as
i
describe
it.
on
the
merits,
the
only
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
201
as
applied
to
restaurants
selling
food
which
has
passed
through
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce.
the
appellees
insist
and
we
agree
that
section
201
applies
to
its
restaurant
because
the
$70,000
sales
of
the
hormel's
meat
are
a
substantial
part
of
the
food
that
it
served,
and
they
have
passed
through
interstate
commerce.
the
only
constitutional
issue
seriously
pressed
by
the
appellees
if
i
understand
their
brief,
is
that
title
ii
is
not
sustainable
under
the
commerce
clause.
they
do
say
a
great
deal
about
the
fifth
amendment
right
freely
to
select
ones
customers,
but
then
towards
the
end
of
that
argument,
they
concede,
if
i
understand
them
right,
that
the
right
is
subject
to
restriction
by
legislation
under
the
commerce
clause
and
of
course
similar
rights
have
been
restricted
by
legislation
under
the
commerce
clause
over
and
over
again.
in
the
heart
of
atlanta
case,
now
i'm
coming
to
the
commerce
clause,
i
developed
or
sought
to
develop
both
the
general
principle
that
we
rely
on
and
the
fact
sustaining
the
statute
as
applied
to
hotels
and
motels.
the
legal
principle
on
which
we
rely
here
is
the
same
one.
the
old
and
familiar
rule
that
congress
may
regulate
activities
which
may
seem
local
when
separately
considered
if
their
regulation
is
an
appropriate
way
of
eliminating
potential
burdens
or
obstructions
to
interstate
commerce.
and
the
principle
applies
as
their
countless
cases
show
to
restaurants
no
less
than
other
retail
establishments.
to
bring
this
case
within
that
general
principle,
we
rely
upon
the
testimony
before
congress
to
which
i
have
referred
earlier
or
to
some
of
which
i
referred
earlier.
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
the
description
of
the
general
conditions
which
general
business
conditions,
the
decline
of
business
conditions
which
were
shown
to
result
from
racial
segregation
and
discrimination
and
the
resulting
disputes
and
disturbances
in
various
communities.
i
refer
to
it
that,
it's
just
as
applicable
to
this
case,
indeed
more
applicable
to
this
case
than
it
was
to
the
previous
one.
here,
we
say
coming
to
restaurants
more
specifically,
that
the
factual
foundation
for
the
congressional
conclusion
that
racial
discrimination
in
a
restaurant
like
the
mcclung
burdens
and
obstructs
interstate
commerce
is
supported
by
two
lines
of
analysis.
first,
it
results
from
the
effective
demonstrations
against
segregation,
second,
it
results
from
the
artificial
narrowing
of
the
consumer
market
by
the
refusal
to
sell
a
large
class
in
many
communities
of
perspective
patronage.
whether
--
where
a
restaurant
serves
food
received
from
interstate
commerce
either
directly
or
indirectly,
any
dispute
involving
that
establishment
which
causes
it
to
close
or
which
reduces
its
patronage
necessarily
diminishes
its
purchases
and
thus
diminishes
the
flow
of
goods
into
the
state
to
meets
its
demand.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
i
think
that
the
chances
are
very,
very
great
that
it
would
distort
the
flow
even
if
it
didn't
cut
down
the
total
amount
and
that
i
think
it
does
as
much
a
interference
with
the
free
flow
of
goods
of
commerce
as
cutting
down
the
total
amount.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
yes.
it's
much
as
in
the
case
of
motion
picture
theaters
in
the
sherman
act
or
labor
disputes
at
various
restaurants.
so
i
think
the
difference
is
in
the
theory.
i
spoke
earlier
of
the
general
effect
of
these
disturbances
upon
business
condition
and
the
shipment
of
goods
in
other
state
--
from
other
states.
the
general
tendency
of
course,
could
be
expected
to
apply
to
the
particular
instance.
indeed
since
discrimination
in
place
is
a
public
accommodation
is
the
focal
point
of
most
of
the
disturbances
of
what
would
expect
the
interference
with
commerce
there
to
be
the
greatest
or
at
least
the
congress
could
so
[inaudible].
this
court
of
course
also
knows
something
about
the
effect
of
segregation
in
restaurants
upon
their
business
and
thus
on
the
shipment
of
goods
too.
at
least
two
of
the
sitting
cases
show
that
the
restaurant
was
closed
for
a
period
after
the
demonstration
took
place.
during
the
1963
demonstrations
against
restaurants
and
lunch
counters,
there
were
at
least
14
states
ranging
from
florida
to
the
carolinas
--
from
california
to
the
carolinas
and
from
delaware
to
florida
in
which
there
were
disturbances
at
restaurants
and
lunch
counters.
taking
north
carolina
alone,
there
were
demonstrations
in
chapel
hill,
done,
goreme
involving
14,000
arrests,
so
one
can
imagine
the
effect
upon
the
restaurants;
goldsboro,
greensboro,
williamstown,
wilmington,
and
winston-salem.
the
effect
of
the
disturbance
upon
the
restaurant
and
so
upon
its
purchases
would
seem
to
me
to
be
precisely
analogous
of
the
effect
of
the
disturbance
depending
upon
the
labor
dispute.
it
adds
to
that
of
course,
the
application
of
the
commerce
power
as
often
been
sustained.
now
there's
a
second
and
still
more
direct
link
between
racial
discrimination
in
restaurants
and
interstate
commerce
which
is
caused
by
the
artificial
narrowing
of
the
consumer
market
resulting
from
the
exclusion
of
bigger
patronage.
artificial
constriction
of
the
market
itself
would
result
in
a
lessened
volume
of
business,
a
lower
volume
of
purchases
or
perhaps
in
additional
restaurants
not
being
started
and
thus
would
affect
the
flow
of
goods.
senator
magnuson
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
had
summarized
this
point
after
he
had
heard
the
testimony
before
the
senate
commerce
committee
of
which
he
is
chairman.
if
these
establishments
narrow
their
potential
markets
by
artificially
restricting
their
patrons
to
non-negroes,
the
volume
of
sales
therefore
the
volume
of
interstate
purchases
will
be
less
although
the
demand
maybe
partly
filled
by
other
establishments
that
do
not
discriminate,
the
effect
will
be
substantial
where
segregation
is
practiced
on
a
large
scale.
the
economic
impact
is
dealt
into
interstate
commerce.
the
supporting
evidence
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
i'm
not
going
to
take
time
to
summarize
it
but
i
do
particularly
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
70
where
appendix
--
page
70
appendix
b
of
the
atlanta
brief.
for
there,
we
have
set
forth
in
a
table
that
you
can
study
later,
the
evidence
showing
that
apparently
as
a
result
of
discrimination,
the
amount
of
expenditures
by
southern
negroes
in
communities
where
segregation
is
practiced,
is
much
less
per
capita,
even
after
adjustments
are
made
for
differences
in
income,
that
is
true
in
the
areas
where
segregation
is
less.
now
as
i
understand
it,
the
appellees
argument
is
considerably
different
from
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
atlanta
case
or
perhaps
because
they
have
a
restaurant
to
deal
with
rather
than
a
motel,
but
i
take
it
that
they
say
essentially
this.
that
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
local
activities
affecting
commerce
is
not
as
broad
as
the
power
to
regulate
commerce,
but
is
confined
to
the
regulation
of
activity
that
do,
in
fact,
create
burdens
or
obstructions
whereas
you
could
regulate
commerce
itself
for
any
reason.
but
you
come
to
regulate
the
activities
affecting
commerce.
it
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
fostering
or
promoting
it
and
they
say
you
can't
regulate
a
man
in
all
his
activities
just
because
he
has
received
goods
in
commerce.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
we
said
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
in
all
his
activity,
yes
and
i'm
willing
to
go
a
little
bit
farther.
i'm
willing
to
accept
his
argument
up
to
that
point
if
i
understand
it
right,
arguendo
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote
that
parts
of
it
are
inconsistent
with
the
united
states
to
get
sullivan
and
the
mandel
case,
but
i
don't
intend
to
dwell
on
that
point.
and
up
to
this
point,
really,
we
marched
along
hand
in
hand.
then
the
appellee's
argument,
as
i
go
on,
says
that
the
present
statute
was
not
conceived
as
a
measurement,
we're
dealing
with
burdens
and
obstructions
to
interstate
commerce,
but
rather
it's
an
effort
to
solve
what
was
considered
to
be
a
social
problem.
that
is
the
appellees
say,
that
it's
shown
the
appellee
is
saying
by
the
absence
of
any
formal
recitals
which
they
have
said
distinguishes
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
agricultural
legislation,
and
also
by
from
--
by
the
absence
of
any
provision
for
a
specific
finding
in
every
specific
case
as
to
the
effect
of
the
discrimination
on
the
interstate
commerce.
then
they
apparently
go
on
and
assert
that
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
declares
there
is
an
interrelationship
between
discrimination
in
commerce,
but
that's
a
arbitrary
presumption,
invalid
because
contrary
to
common
experience.
now
let
me
if
i
may
deal
with
the
last
point
first
to
work
backwards
in
a
sense
because
i
think
the
whole
argument
unravels
when
you
note
the
last
point
particularly.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
because
i
want
to
deal
with
this
very
precisely
to
the
bottom
of
page
20
of
the
appellee's
mimeograph
brief.
there
they
say,
we've
been
unable
to
find
in
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
gave
any
consideration
whatever
to
or
even
had
any
testimony
bearing
upon
an
affect
on
commerce
being
generated
by
a
restaurant
serving
in
food
which
has
moved
in
commerce.
in
the
last
sentence,
aside
from
that
however,
it
is
clear
that
the
mere
fact
standing
alone,
mere
fact
standing
alone,
that
a
restaurant
serves
food
which
has
at
some
time
in
the
past
across
the
state
line,
would
not
in
every
case,
necessarily
justify
the
conclusion
that
its
racial
policy
would
have
an
actual
effect
on
commerce.
now
there
are
two
faults
in
that
argument
which
seem
to
me
really
runs
through
the
entire
brief.
the
first
is
this.
there
is
no
requirement
that
it'd
be
shown
that
the
activities
that
congress
regulates
under
the
commerce
clause
would,
in
every
case,
necessarily
affect
interstate
commerce.
as
chief
justice
marshall
held
back
in
mcclung
–
maryland,
the
word
necessary
doesn't
mean
absolutely
essential,
a
compelled
relationship
in
every
instance.
it
means
not
indispensable,
appropriate,
useful,
incidental,and
adapt
into
the
end.
and
congress
certainly
could
reach
those
local
activities
which
are
a
more
or
less
constant
practice
and
create
as
chief
justice
taft
said
in
stanford
and
wallace
a
threat
of
injury
to
commerce.
he
said
there,
whatever
is
a
more
or
less
constant
practice
that
creates
a
threat
of
injury
to
commerce
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
deal
with.
in
the
labor
board
cases,
chief
justice
hughes
pointed
out
simply
to
the
evidence
that
refusals
to
bargain
and
discrimination
were
a
prolific
source
of
labor
disputes
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
of
course,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
shown
in
the
safety
appliance
act
that
the
omission
of
a
safety
appliance
from
every
car
moving
in
intrastate
commerce
would
necessarily
affect
interstate
commerce
or
in
that
the
issuance
of
a
forged
warehouse
receipt
would
in
every
case
necessarily
affect
interstate
commerce.
we're
dealing
with
practical
things
here
with
tendency,
with
likelihoods,
with
risks,
and
that's
what
all
the
commerce
clause
cases
dealing
with
affecting
commerce
that
dealt
with
for
many,
many
years.
now
the
second
fault
in
the
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
page
20,
in
appellee's
brief,
exemplifies
what
i
think
is
another
error
that
runs
through
the
argument.
it
attempts
to
focus
attention
simply
upon
the
past
movement
of
the
goods.
it
says
we
must
look
at
that
standing
alone
and
the
fact
that
goods
have
in
the
past
moved
across
state
lines,
doesn't
show
that
racial
segregation
in
the
future
affect
commerce,
but
of
course,
that
isn't
what
congress
was
concerned
with
and
the
statute
makes
this
quite
plain.
indeed
the
statute
doesn't
even
speak
in
the
past
tense.
it
speaks
of
someone
who
serves
or
offers
to
serve
which
has
both,
but
it
gets
the
current
serves
or
offers
to
serve
and
why
is
that
important
because
the
fact
that
a
substantial
portion
that
the
food
--
of
the
food
that
he
serves
or
offers
to
serve
has
moved
in
interstate
commerce
indicates
that
if
nothing
happens
to
his
business,
there
is
every
probability
that
in
the
future,
he
will
continue
to
acquire
a
substantial
portion
of
his
good
from
out
of
state.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
then
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
it.
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
certainly
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
and,
your
honors,
right,
and
i
spoke
too
generally.
i'm
still
focusing
on
the
commerce
clause.
it
could
because
here
you
see,
congress
has
not,
as
it
might
have
done,
so
i
don't
argue,
justify
the
statute,
it
might,
i
think,
have
reached
everyone
on
the
theory
that
the
general
effect
of
business
conditions
that
i've
described
was
enough,
but
it
went
farther.
it's
said
we
don't
want
to
go
that
far
in
the
local
affairs.
we
got
to
require
an
addition
that
each
particular
establishment
have
some
link
to
commerce.
but
what
i'm
--
the
point
i'm
pressing
is
that
the
past,
the
fact
that
the
goods
have
come
in
from
out
of
state
is
important
with
respect
to
what
is
likely
to
happen
in
the
future.
well
that
is
its
irrelevant.
the
congress
was
concerned
or
certainly
could
have
been
concerned
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
with
the
effect
of
racial
segregation
now
upon
the
future
movement
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce
and
it's
the
threatened
disruption
of
that
future
movement
that
the
statute
is
reasonably
adopted
to
protecting,
preventing
future
disruption.
now
the
appellee's
answer
to
this
apparently
is,
“well
congress
didn't
say
so.”
there
are
no
express
findings
that
it
was
concerned
with
the
effect
of
the
future
movement
of
commerce.
we
have
two
answers,
both
we
think
independently
sufficient
to
that
point.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
congress
did
putting
effectively,
indicate
that
it
was
concerned
with
this.
it
found
in
section
201
(c)
that
the
operations
of
an
establishment
affect
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
this
title
if
it
serves
or
offers
to
serve
the
food
that
we
have
referred
to,
but
what
is
the
operations
of
the
restaurant
affect
commerce
mean.
i
take
it
that
that
needs
all
its
operations,
including
who
it
chooses
to
serve
food
to
it
or
who
it
doesn't
choose
to
serve
food
to
and
it
says
that
that
part
of
the
operations
like
the
others
affect
commerce
where
this
has
to
take
place
or
at
least
i
submit
that
they
had
some
entirely
reasonable
reading
and
the
statute
should
be
read,
of
course,
to
put
its
best
life
for
constitutional
purposes
rather
than
its
words.
now
second,
we
say
that
the
finding
is
quite
unnecessary.
the
court
spoke
upon
this
very
point
in
the
carolene
products
case.
i
won't
--
i've
quoted
it
in
my
brief,
but
it
said
very
clearly
that
there
was
even
in
the
absence
of
findings
supporting
the
legislative
judgment
that
the
court
would
presume
the
existence
of
those
facts.
that
principle
is
certainly
applicable
here.
the
fact
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
i
would
argue
that
you
should
treat
them
as
findings
or
draw
any
significance
from
it
at
all.
there
was
a
discussion
about
whether
congress
should
or
shouldn't
make
finding.
there
was
a
discussion
about
what
constitutional
ground
it
should
rely
on,
there
is
also
a
feeling
now
on
capital
hill
that
congress
should
give
up
the
practice
of
the
authorities
and
never
make
findings,
leaving
it
entirely
to
be
handled
as
mr.
justice
stone
suggested
in
carolene
products
case.
so
i
don't
think
your
honors,
would
either
be
warded
in
relying
on
the
previous
finding
or
in
drawing
any
inference
to
that.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
would
ignore
them.
well,
i
would
ignore
them
except
to
this
extent.
i
think
that
you
certainly
can
and
must
take
account
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
or
at
least
many
people
in
congress
were
concerned
with
the
commercial
problem
as
whether
as
the
other
aspect
of
this
problem
and
that
therefore,
the
presumption
that
congress
acted
on
this
theory
is
not
an
unreasonable
one.
when
you've
gone
that
far,
i
think
that
is
far
as
you
have
to
go
because
of
course
the
fatal
error
here
in
the
appellee's
argument
is
that
they
are
asking
the
court
to
presume
that
congress
acted
on
a
vulnerable
constitutional
theory
and
then
they
argue
that
that
theory
is
invalid
but
this
just
turns
the
world
upside
down
to
the
extent
that
the
court
will
look
into
--
on
what
theory
the
congress
acted
at
all.
it
will
presume
that
the
congress
did
its
duty
and
that
each
congress
couldn't
just
like
this
part,
they
do
it
best
to
defend
and
uphold
the
constitution.
i
hardly
need
authorities
but
the
authorities
on
that
point
again
were
collected
in
my
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
the
only
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
i
could
but
i
think
that
i'd
effect,
rely
on
both.
i
ask
the
court
in
--
i
ask
the
court
to
bear
it
in
mind
that
the
congress
in
weighing
the
effect
of
this
particular
link
was
free
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
this
is
an
aspect
of
a
much
larger
problem
that
i
described.
i
don't
like
to
say
that
i
stand
on
either
one
without
the
other
one.
i've
got
both.
i
wouldn't
take
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
no,
oh
no.
certainly
not
limited
the
first
and
i
should
point
out
so
that
there's
no
misunderstanding.
we
have
suggested
a
quite
different
theory
that
i've
not
argued
earlier
and
which
we
haven't
argued
in
our
brief,
that
is
that
on
the
basis
of
the
sullivan
case
that
congress
may
regulate
what
a
retailer
does
with
goods
that
he
has
received
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
yes,
that
is
the
appeal.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
well
as
i
say,
i'm
not
pressing
this
on
the
court.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
that
a
man
shall
not
beat
his
wife
to
making
that
a
federal
crime
because
he
strike
cigarettes
that
came
from
--
well
he
smokes
cigarettes
that
comes
from
north
carolina,
and
saying
that
one
shall
not
use
food
when
he's
gotten
in
the
interstate
commerce
in
order
to
perpetuate
a
practice
that
the
congress
regards
as
damaging
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
yes.
but
i'm
--
i
--
again,
well
i
don't
want
the
part
forgotten.
i
do
want
to
say
that
i'm
--
i'm
not
urging
it
now.
it's
a
quite
different
point
from
the
one
that
i
have
been
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
was
thinking
exactly
the
same.
i
was
thinking
exactly
the
same
and
i
rely
on
it
exactly
to
the
same
extent.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
would
think
sullivan
would
go
a
long
way
to
sustain
that,
yes.
i
don't
think
that
has
to
be
decided
here
but
i
think
that
sullivan
would
seem
to
me
to
sustain
that.
again,
i
--
i
would
--
i
draw
out
the
reason
i
insist
on
the
difference
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
statute
can
be
upheld
under
the
commerce
clause,
under
what
i
have
said
is
existing
principles
without
any
extension
of
those
principles
or
any
truly
novel
application.
i
think
that
this
hypothetical
statute
you
post
and
the
use
of
the
sullivan
case
along
the
theory
i
indicate
would
involve
maybe
an
extension
or
at
least
a
picking
up
of
the
little
used
theory
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
for
me
to
picture
my
case
or
for
the
court
to
picture
its
decision.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
think
it's
quite
unnecessary
as
that
it
is
--
this
is
just
the
kind
of
case
where
it
is
wise
to
keep
within
the
established
principles,
the
familiar
roles
that
really
haven't
been
questioned
for
years
and
go
back
as
i
say
to
chief
justice
marshall.
now
the
other
argument,
or
sub
argument,
that
goes
with
appellees'
point
is
that
here
the
statute
provides
for
no
specific
factual
inquiries
that
the
discrimination
in
this
restaurant
affects
or
it
is
likely
to
affect
the
movement
of
goods
in
interstate
commerce.
but
there's
nothing
novel
in
that.
congress
over
and
over
again
has
made
determinations
for
itself
in
the
darby
lumber
case.
mr.
chief
justice
stone
pointed
this
out
and
said
that
sometimes
congress
provides
for
an
inquiry
by
the
administrative
agency.
sometimes
it
provides
for
the
inquiry
by
the
courts.
sometimes
it
makes
its
own
determination
and
that
where
it
makes
its
own
determination,
the
only
question
going
back
to
the
passage
mr.
justice
black
was
pointing
to
this
morning
is
whether
the
end
is
within
the
power
of
congress
and
whether
this
is
a
means
of
reasonably
adapted
to
achieving
that
end.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
is
done
in
this
statute
is
identical
with
what
was
done
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
at
the
very
argument
that
was
made
here
was
pressed
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
rejected.
congress
determined
for
itself
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
the
payment
of
substandard
goods
--
wages
in
establishments
producing
goods
for
interstate
commerce
did
tend
to
burden
and
obstruct
commerce.
and
it
left
open
for
judicial
inquiry
only
the
question
whether
the
particular
establishment
produced
goods
for
interstate
commerce.
and
so
here,
commerce
determined
for
itself
that
the
practice
of
segregation
in
restaurants
that
depend
on
interstate
commerce
for
their
purchases
which
is
the
affect
of
the
past
motive
will
tend
to
burden
and
obstruct
commerce.
it
left
open
for
judicial
inquiry
the
question
whether
they
do
depend
on
commerce
for
their
purchase
so
that
the
parallel
i
submit
is
complete.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
exactly
the
same.
the
national
labor
relations
board
never
inquires
whether
a
particular
discriminatory
discharge
or
a
particular
refusal
to
bargain
may
burden
or
obstruct
interstate
commerce.
it
inquires
as
we
all
know,
of
what
is
the
volume
of
goods
of
that
establishment
ships
out
of
the
state
or
imports
into
the
state.
and
if
the
necessary
volume
is
made
out,
then
the
board
takes
jurisdiction.
indeed
the
reliance
fuel
case
decided
here
two
terms
ago,
reversed
a
rule
against
the
second
circuit
which
it
set
the
case
back
to
the
board
to
find
out
whether
the
unfair
labor
practices
in
the
particular
establishment
affected
commerce.
and
said
it
was
enough
to
prove
that
that
establishment
had
a
substantial
inflow
of
goods,
that
was
a
retail
establishment
like
this.
whether
the
board
does
have
to
--
or
because
it
takes
congress
in
effect
decided
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
called
labor
relations
in
the
particular
establishment
or
whether
it
does,
it
is
a
matter
of
its
own
laying
down
a
general
rule
really
is
immaterial
because
if
the
board
can
do
it,
then
so
can
the
congress.
and
in
this
connection,
i
should
perhaps
say,
of
course
it's
immaterial
whether
if
all
the
other
restaurants
of
birmingham
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
statute
that
nonconformance
by
this
particular
restaurant
would
not
be
very
important.
that
point
is
resolved
over
and
over
again
in
cases
under
the
--
by
really
everyone
of
these
statutes
including
wickard
and
filburn,
united
states
and
darby,
and
the
cases
that
are
dealing
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
i
don't
think
my
argument
really
goes
that
far.
i
think
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier.
i
said
perhaps
i
could
rely
on
that,
but
the
congress
didn't
go
that
far.
congress
also
said,
not
only,
it
not
also
had
this
evidence
of
general
conditions
in
front
of
it,
but
it
had
evidence
that
this
particular
establishment
made
its
own
individual
contribution
to
the
flow
of
goods
in
commerce
so
that
this
particular
establishment
is
tied
to
its
trickle
of
goods
that
will
be
coming
in
in
the
future,
trickle
that
would
be
enlarged.
the
effect
might
be
enlarged
and
congress
could
find
would
be
enlarged,
if
the
effect
of
artificially
narrowing
the
market
were
removed
at
a
trickle
which
might
be
damned
up
and
stopped
the
movement
of
the
flow
of
goods
if
a
dispute
occurred
as
a
result
of
it.
and
i
think,
mr.
justice,
i
rely
on
the
general
condition
for
choosing,
one
to
make
the
obvious
point
that
was
made
in
the
reliance
fuel
case
that
this
trickle
is
representative
of
thousands,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
similar
trickles
and
that
together
they
are
a
great
stream,
a
national
economic
problem
as
witness
has
testified
before
the
commission.
and
second,
that
the
general
description
shows
that
these
trickles
and
these
disputes
are
not
unrelated
among
themselves
and
i
think
congress
was
entitled
to
take
that
into
account
in
judging
its
action.
i
would
like
to
if
i
may
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
archibald
cox,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
late
now.
i'll
try
to
confine
myself
in
clarifying
the
client,
fairly
two
points
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised.
first,
so
far
as
the
matters
of
pleadings
go,
we
of
course,
have
no
objection
to
mr.
smith's
pleadings
being
treated
as
if
he
were
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
point
of
my
acquiescence
in
the
suggestion
stops
there.
i
don't
think
it
essentially
changes
the
case,
but
i
don't
mean
to
stand
on
any
point
of
pleading.
now
with
respect
to
our
view
on
the
effect
of
the
demonstrations
of
the
kind
that
took
place
in
birmingham,
being
directed
against
racial
segregation
in
places
of
public
accommodation
of
all
kinds,
our
view
with
respect
to
that
as
i
tried
to
state
it
and
now
i'm
trying
to
be
accurate
again
is
it
would
be
quite
possible
for
us
to
argue
and
we
do
argue
to
the
extent
that
it's
necessary.
we
certainly
don't
abandon
the
argument
that
as
racial
segregation
in
places
of
public
accommodation
generally,
causes
disturbances,
demonstrations
that
interfere
with
the
course
of
retail
business
generally
and
so
lessen
the
flow
of
goods
into
the
state
and
as
previously
shown
before
congress
did
happen,
that
is
sufficient
to
justify
prohibiting
discrimination
in
all
such
places
under
the
commerce
clause.
now
i
say
that
i
don't
stand
on
that,
meaning
only
that
that
isn't
the
whole
of
my
argument
that
i
don't
have
to
ask
the
court
to
go
that
far.
i
don't
mean
that
i
abandon
the
argument
or
that
i
hesitate
to
make
it.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
the
congress
apparently
concluded
itself
not
to
rely
upon
--
not
to
reach
that
broadly.
i
don't
know
why,
but
it
concluded
that,
so
far
as
this
case
and
this
type
of
case
goes
where
we're
not
involving
discrimination
supported
by
a
state
action,
that
it
would
make
this
applicable
only
to
all
the
restaurants
which
are
serving
food
received
in
interstate
commerce.
and
there,
there
is
another
individual
link
of
which
we
think
is
on
the
precedents
in
effect
conclusive.
we
think
its
importance
is
to
be
appraised
not
in
terms
of
the
individual
restaurant
or
the
likelihood
of
a
dispute
of
that
individual
restaurant,
but
rather
of
the
tendency
at
all
restaurants
of
this
kind
which
of
course
this
the
effect
in
wickard
and
filburn,
the
effect
in
reliance
fuel,
and
all
the
others
and
we
see
no
reason
to
suppose
that
congress
wasn't
mindful
of
that
and
took
the
cumulative
effect
in
the
view.
now
i
would
like
in
this
connection
to
emphasize
one
distinction
which
occur
one
point
which
of
course
its
the
appellees
interest
to
fuzz
over
a
bit.
i
don't
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
section
201
(c)
(2)
makes
the
act
applicable
to
every
restaurant
that
ever
has
received
some
food
from
out
of
the
state.
that
would
be
a
quite
different
case
at
least
in
respect
to
what
i
stated
second
was
the
--
the
second
thrust,
the
second
point
if
i
may
of
the
thrust
to
my
argument
because
here
it
speaks
in
terms
of
serves
or
offers
to
serve.
i
presume
that,
that
means
something
continuing.
and
while
it
is
true
in
the
case
of
virginia
hams
like
a
fine
wine
seller,
i
suppose
things
there
maybe
held
and
served
over
a
period
of
time,
that's
the
freak
case.
now
the
average
case,
of
course
would
be
of
the
90%
of
the
cases
where
if
you
are
serving
food,
a
substantial
portion
of
which
comes
from
out
of
state,
this
is
a
practice.
you're
doing
it
and
there's
a
general
turnover
and
the
freak
case,
congress
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
take
into
account
under
the
penumbra
doctrine.
it's
up
to
it
to
draw
--
to
draw
a
line
because
we
must
remember
here
that
congress
does
have
the
power
under
the
[inaudible]
purchase
of
purity
extract
&
tonic
against
lynch
and
the
other
cases
dealing
with
the
transportation
of
intoxicating
liquors
to
consider
the
interrelationship
between
these
businesses
and
to
draw
the
line
so
that
it
is
not
unfair
to
those
who
are
closer
to
congress
to
let
the
other
ones
go.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
stand
on
any
such
thing
but
again
i
don't
abandon
that.
i
might
suggest
one
final
and
general
word
here.
a
good
deal
has
been
said
about
if
congress
can
do
this
then
it
can
do
that,
if
congress
could
do
that,
then
it
can
do
--
go
further
and
this
may
swallow
up
on
the
distinction
between
the
nation
and
the
states.
of
course,
what
has
to
be
drawn
here
is
a
practical
line
and
a
line
which
the
cases
make
clear
is
for
congress
to
draw
and
the
only
question
here
is
the
burden
isn't
on
us
to
prove
the
relationship
between
these
practices
in
interstate
commerce
even
if
we
hadn't
said
--
hadn't
a
word
of
evidence
of
that
kind
as
mr.
justice
black
has
suggested.
still,
unless
the
court
could
conclude
that
there
was
no
rational
relationship
that
the
congress
could
find
but
then
the
congressional
judgment
would
be
conclusive.
and
we
simply
go
forward
to
show
that
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
of
things
that
the
congress
could
take
into
account
in
addition
to
what
they
know
of
their
own
knowledge
not
to
the
exclusion
of
it.
this
wasn't
a
matter
of
a
record.
we'll
take
this
that
congressman
knew
out
of
their
own
experience
were
relevant
for
them
to
take
into
account
here.
where
there
is
that
rational
basis,
then
as
it's
so
often
the
case,
of
course,
the
place
to
which
the
people
must
look
to
draw
the
line,
to
preserve
a
difference
between
what
is
local
and
what
is
national,
is
to
the
wisdom
and
discretion
of
the
congress.
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
pointed
this
out
in
the
gibbons
and
ogden
and
referring
to
the
congressman
said
that
they
are
the
restraints
on
which
the
people
must
often
rely
solely
as
in
all
representative
governments.
here,
we
think
that
connection
existed
that
we
have
clearly
shown
that
there's
something
which
congress
could,
indeed
i
think
must
rationally
rely
on
as
a
national
commercial
problem.
and
once
that
appears
and
the
legislation
is
shown
to
be
reasonably
adapted
to
solving
that
problem,
then
the
question
of
what
action
shall
be
taken
or
not
be
taken
as
far
as
the
congress,
that
is
the
place
where
people
must
look
for
the
final
decision
under
those
circumstances.
