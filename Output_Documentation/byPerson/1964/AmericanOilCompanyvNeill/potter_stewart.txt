there's
no
question
but
that
the
--
rather
the
strange
language
of
the
statute
does
apply
to
this
situation.
justice

stewart
that
it
was
received
by
utah
when
it
--
when
it

an
earlier

to
avoid
business
tax
which

justice
potter
stewart
--
the

is
(voice
overlap),
have
that
gone
up

itself,
but
rather
to
the
contractor?
justice
potter
stewart
just
like
then
but
--
or
is
that
in
another
case,
that's
not
this
case
and
i

the
united
states
itself
would
be
immune
from
state
accusation?
justice
potter
stewart
uh-hmm.
