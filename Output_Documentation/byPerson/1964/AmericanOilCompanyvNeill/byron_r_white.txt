justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
do
you
know
whether
in
the
bidding
there
were
some
competing
bids
that
were
submitted
by
people
who
did
not
hold
the
permit
in
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
suppose
that
albeit
the
--
everybody
submitted
a
bid
but
it
had
--
to
have
been
--
had
a
permit
when
they
--
because
of
--
wasn't
--
one
alternative
they
have
to
bid
on
actual
delivery
in
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
they
all
have
to
bid
on
the
--
on
a
situation
that
involves
delivery
in
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
meant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
government
had
wanted
to
have
the
--
have
it
delivered
at
the
installation
site
at
some
point,
the
bidder
to
be
--
the
substantial
bidder
would
have
to
be
qualified
in
idaho.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
some
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
started
out
on
this
bid
first
having
it
actually
delivered
at
the
installation
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
mr.
goodman,
when
was
your
reply
brief
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
seem
to
have
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
said,
it's
on
the
gas
or
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
words
of
the
statute
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
a
tax
on
gas
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
payable
by
the
dealers,
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
that
may
mean
that
it's
a
tax
on
the
dealer,
from
the
idaho's
standpoint,
but
the
law
says
it's
a
tax
on
gasoline.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
bound
by
these
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rules,
mr.
general,
that
the
record
of
the
courts
were
probably
literally
true,
weren't
they?
i
suppose
utah
oil
company
actually
delivered
this
gasoline
to
the
common
carrier
down
in
the
salt
lake
with
the
--
and
phillips
petroleum
company
is
probably
consignee
of
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
suggest
that
this
transaction
is
as
--
is
almost
or
fairly
a
sham,
that
through
which
we
ought
to,
at
least
take
a
brief
peek
and
that
even
if
we
did,
all
it
get
to
and
according
to
you
is
that
this
was
really
a
contract
for
delivery
inside
idaho.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
these
two
--
that
these
two
items
in
the
whole
list
should
be
treated
like
the
others,
namely
that
this
utah
oil
company
really
was
delivering
the
gasoline
to
the
united
states
in
idaho.
but
now,
what
cases
here
in
this
court
would
permit
the
state
of
idaho
to
tax
--
put
a
tax
on
the
dealer
or
in
the
gasoline
the
dealer
is
delivering,
inside
idaho
where
the
only
connection
with
the
state
of
idaho
is
just
the
delivery
of
the
gasoline.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
dealer
--
on
the
dealer,
not
on
the
government,
on
the
dealer.
justice
byron
r.
white
here
is
utah
oil
company
makes
a
contract
in
salt
lake
with
the
united
states
and
it
agrees
to
deliver
to
the
united
states
in
idaho.
and
it
does
so,
it
delivers
at
the
site
pursuant
to
the
contract.
do
you
suggest
that
under
that
situation,
idaho
most
certainly
could
impose
a
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
cases
in
this
court
would
permit
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it's
not
imposed
on
the
government,
but
it's
imposed
on
the
dealer
for
making
an
interstate
sale.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it
might
--
the
state
might
be
--
i
think
the
state
might
be
permitted
to
put
a
sales
tax
on
that
kind
of
a
transaction.
now,
how
about
putting
this
kind
of
a
tax
on
that
kind
of
a
transaction?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
goodman,
if
the
statute
of
commerce
clause
argument
is
any
good,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
either
where
--
where
it
was
delivered,
does
it?
to
the
extent
that
your
place
of
delivery
has
got
something
to
do
with
due
process,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
taxing
the
dealer
or
the
gasoline.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
even
if
--
even
if
the
--
even
if
you
look
at
this
case
as
sham
case,
the
sham
transactions
as
if
the
paper
avoidance
of
delivery
in
idaho,
you
still
would
have
that
question
left?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
goodman,
did
you
say
you
didn't
know
--
you
don't
know
of
any
cases
which,
in
this
court
which
might
sustain
the
state's
imposition
of
the
tax
on
the
dealer,
his
only
connection
with
the
state
in
a
particular
transaction,
the
delivery
of
the
gasoline
within
the
state.
now,
what's
wrong
with
norton?
i
mean
after
awhile
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
only
thing
that
happened
here
is
somewhat
in
idaho,
united
states
and
idaho
solicits
some
--
gasoline
makes
a
contract
to
buy
it
outside
the
state,
and
the
out-of-state
seller
agrees
to
sell
it
and
ships
it
interstate
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
the
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
have
you
hung
your
case
here
on,
on
the
--
i
guess
the
contractor
that
--
why
do
made
so
much
to
that
fact,
the
contract
that
made
outside
of
the
--
or
the
delivery
was
outside
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
really
make
any
difference?
