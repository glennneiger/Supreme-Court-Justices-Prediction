mr.
allan
g.
shepard
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
of
a
type
which
the
court
has
not
specifically
dealt
with
before.
i
would
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
law
which
we
contend
governs
this
case
is
not
particularly
complicated
and
has
been
enunciated
by
the
court
before.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
is
complicated
about
this
case,
extremely
complicated,
if
the
court
please,
is
the
factual
pattern.
and
i
would
further
suggest
that
this
factual
pattern
is
complicated
because
the
appellants
and
the
government
sought
to
and
did
make
it
complicated.
i
think
certain
guide
post
should
be
enunciated
at
the
outset
because
frankly,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
the
briefs.
and
i
would
say
that
the
record
is
poor
in
this
case
from
the
state
of
idaho
standpoint.
this
was
a
tax
which
was
imposed
on
a
dealer.
there
has
been
talked
around
and
about
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
there
is
a
use
tax
or
is
it
a
sales
tax,
what
type
of
tax
is
it.
it
is,
if
the
court
please,
a
tax
upon
the
dealer.
it
is
designed
for
the
idaho
supreme
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
mr.
justice?
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
well,
the
idaho's
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
yes
sir.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
the
idaho
supreme
court
has
enunciated
mr.
justice
white
but
it
is
a
tax
on
the
dealer.
however,
i
would
agree
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
this
particular
case
below
in
which
the
court
becomes
concerned
with
enunciating
perhaps
that
the
utilization
of
the
tax
is
for
the
construction
of
highways,
for
the
maintenance
of
highways.
but
essentially
it
is
a
tax
on
the
dealer,
although
i
agree
perhaps
ultimately
a
tax
on
the
gas.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
think
the
court
has
so
ruled
in
the
past,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
there
is
no
question
of
sales
or
use
tax,
and
i
think
the
only
validity
or
materiality
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
cases
as
enunciated
by
this
court
before
is
in
the
language
of
those
cases
which
announces
that
a
state
is
not
inhibited
from
reaching
apart
beyond
its
borders
to
impose
a
tax.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
would
suggest
also
to
this
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
governmental
immunity.
as
stated
before,
this
is
a
tax
on
the
dealers
and
i
don't
think
that
the
resurrection
of
mccleod
versus
maryland
adds
anything
to
the
case.
or
in
particularly
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
materiality
to
the
governmental
immunity
argument
since
the
overruling
of
the
panhandle
case.
and
i
would
take
that
it
is
a
established
law
now
as
announced
by
this
court
that
the
fact
that
a
tax
is
imposed
upon
a
person
who
deals
with
the
government
and
at
the
ultimate
result
of
that
tax
may
be
that
the
government
pays
more
for
a
product
or
for
a
contract
because
of
the
imposition
of
the
tax
upon
some
other
person
since
the
overruling
of
panhandle
is
no
longer
material.
i
would
suggest
also,
that
the
one
of
the
guide
points
in
this
case
is
that
no
tax
is
imposed
until
the
gasoline
is
received
in
idaho.
and
the
gasoline
which
is
the
subject
to
really
of
this
case
was
actually
received
in
idaho.
it
was
used
to
propel
busses
operated
by
a
private
company,
if
the
court
please,
to
transport
for
hire
its
employees
and
employees
of
other
private
companies
over
thousands
of
miles
of
highways
all
in
the
state
of
idaho,
to
and
from
the
operations
of
that
and
other
private
companies.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
it
was
received
in
the
years
1959
and
1960,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
in
the
late
months
of
1959,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
utah
oil
company,
the
predecessor
of
appellant
here.
in
conformance
with
the
statute
submitted
reports
to
the
state
of
idaho
as
it
was
required
to
do
as
a
licensed
dealer
indicating
that
it
had
shift
to
a
small
town
in
idaho
known
as
the
code
of
idaho.
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
i
can't
recall
the
precise
gallonage,
but
the
quantities
of
the
gasoline
sold
under
the
contract
here
to
phillips
petroleum
company
--
i
would
say
this,
appellants
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
suggest
that
the
submission
of
such
report
by
the
appellant
was
a
result
of
a
clerical
error
by
some
person
in
appellant's
office.
the
rest
of
the
gasoline
of
appellant
contends
at
least
was
delivered
f.o.b.
salt
lake.
the
record
is
in
controversy
mr.
chief
justice
as
to
that
point.
there
are
--
i
should
explain
further
perhaps
at
this
point
as
quickly
as
i
may,
that
this
case
was
decided
at
the
trial
level
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
therefore,
there
was
no
testimony
as
such
but
there
were
affidavits
back
and
forth
on
both
sides
as
to
the
facts.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
there
are
affidavits
in
the
record
and
i
was
about
to
make
this
point,
mr.
justice
white
by
or
i
should
say
there
were
affidavits
indicating
that
the
traffic
manager
of
phillips
petroleum
company
at
idaho
falls
stated
flatly
that
the
gasoline
was
ordered
by
phillips
petroleum
company
that
the
common
carrier
to
deliver
it
from
salt
lake
to
idaho
falls
was
designated
by
phillips
petroleum
company,
that
the
costs
of
so
transporting
the
gasoline
by
common
carrier
were
paid
by
phillips
petroleum
company,
that
the
gasoline
was
unloaded
by
phillips
petroleum
company
employees.
and
further
if
the
court
please,
this
was
not
by
the
same
traffic
manager
but
the
record
contains
an
allegation
that
the
entire
transaction,
the
statement
was
supposedly
made
by
phillips'
officials
that
the
entire
transaction
was
the
sham
paper,
wash
transaction,
however
one
might
characterize
it,
entered
into
by
the
aec,
phillips
petroleum,
and
utah
oil
for
the
sole
purpose
of
subverting
the
tax.
this
is
in
controversy
certainly
in
the
record.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
was
going
to
get
into
that,
your
honor,
when
i
try
to
lay
up
the
facts
a
little
more
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
think
i
might
turn
to
the
facts
in
the
case
in
or
about
1950,
phillips
petroleum
company
your
honor,
among
others,
had
contracts
with
the
aec
for
the
operation
of
a
reactor
test
site
in
idaho,
a
very
large
installation
approximately
the
size
of
rhode
island.
this
is
some
approximately
150
miles
north
of
the
idaho-utah
border.
phillips
as
a
part
of
this
operating
contract
for
operating
reactors
and
doing
really
complicated
nuclear
energy
work
of
--
as
a
corollary
event,
or
necessary
corollary
perhaps
operated
a
fleet
of
buses,
as
a
subject
for
transporting
for
hire
personnel
employed
by
it
and
other
private
contractors
of
g.e.,
argonne
laboratories,
westinghouse,
of
other
contractors
who
have
other
contracts
with
the
aec
to
do
the
same
thing.
varying
in
distances,
they
transported
these
employees
from
16
or
18
tunnels
in
idaho
from
distances
varying
up
to
75
miles
to
and
from
work.
i
should
point
out
that
this
reactor
test
site
is
located
in
a
desert,
a
substantial
distance
from
any
community
at
all
and
there's
no
governmental
housing
at
the
site.
it's
all
from
neighboring
tunnels.
this
was
done
over
highways
located
outside
this
test
site
which
were
constructed
and
maintained
by
the
state
of
idaho.
now,
appellant
makes
a
point
in
its
brief,
in
its
reply
brief,
i
think
it's
merely
a
carping
argument,
the
government
had
in
its
federal
aid
relationships
with
the
state
of
idaho
furnish
some
of
the
money
for
the
construction
of
these
highways,
and
certainly
this
is
true.
but
i
don't
think
the
argument
is
really
worthy
of
the
government.
the
companies
at
that
time
in
1950,
sought
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
the
idaho
gasoline
tanks.
that
effort
failed
after
the
rulings
by
the
idaho
attorney
general's
office
and
the
rulings
of
the
comptroller
general's
office.
these
rulings
are
contained
in
the
record
in
the
case
here.
and
it
was
not
until
1959
that
another
attempt
was
made
to
subvert
the
imposition
of
idaho
gasoline
tax
which
is
resulted
in
this
case
here.
in
1959,
the
general
services
administration
as
it
had
done
in
the
past
call
for
bids
for
gasoline
to
be
furnished
as
counsel
stated
to
some
607
government
sites
in
the
four
northwest
states.
now,
i
would
point
out
particularly
that
out
of
these
607
governmental
installations,
it
was
required
that
gasoline
be
delivered
to
every
single
one
of
those
sites
with
the
exception
of
two
those
here,
which
has
been
stated,
the
bidding
parties
were
permitted
to
bid
in
the
alternative
as
to
delivering
f.o.b.
salt
lake
city
or
f.o.b.
site
in
idaho.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
no,
sir.
that
had
terminated
when
the
idaho
attorney
general's
office
at
that
time
supported
i
guess
one
might
say
by
the
comptroller
general's
opinion
rule
that
the
tax
must
be
paid
and
the
contractor
then
involved
and
the
government
complied.
so
it
never
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
mr.
justice,
the
record
doesn't
show
this
but
i'm
positive
that
their
sale
was
made
at
that
time
within
the
state.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
so
that
in
that
way,
the
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
no,
i
think
it
was
made
to
the
united
states
itself.
and
i
could
be
wrong,
as
i
say,
this
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
one
would
think
so.
so
i
must
be
wrong
in
saying
it
was
united
states,
it
must
have
been
a
direct
sale
to
a
contractor.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
appellant
has
stated
that
the
appellant
bid
on
approximately
90
of
these
607.
i
may
have
misunderstood
them.
i
think
the
record
indicates
that
it
had
been
in
approximately
30
installations
through
the
northwest,
substantially
in
idaho.
it
was
a
successful
bidder
on
nine
of
these
installations
and
of
these
nine,
seven
were
to
be
delivered
in
idaho,
f.o.b.
the
site
in
idaho.
the
tax
was
to
be
paid
thereon.
they
were
delivered
at
f.o.b.
site
in
idaho,
the
tax
was
paid
thereon
and
no
demand
for
refund
has
been
made
by
appellant.
now,
i
think
the
--
i
should
discuss
here
to
some
extent
the
importance
of
this
contract
because
to
my
way
of
thinking,
appellants
in
our
case
hangs
on
the
--
to
me
rather
slender
thread
of
its
attempting,
in
its
ability
perhaps,
to
convince
this
court
that
this
is
a
completely
severable
court,
that
the
court
should
ignore
every
single
instance
of
petroleum
sales
in
this
contract
and
concentrate
merely
on
these
two
items
of
this
government
contract.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
well,
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
talking
about
two
entirely
different
types
of
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
--
tax,
you're
talking
therein
about
two
entirely
different
types
of
taxes.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
well,
i
think
this
would
fall
squarely
within
the
cases
governing
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
think
these
would
fall
within
the
cases
governing
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
yes.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
think
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
contract
had
one
seller,
utah
oil
company.
it
had
one
purchaser.
it
had
one
contract
number.
it
dealt
with
one
item,
gasoline,
of
one
quality.
it
was
each
item
in
that
contract
was
subject
to
the
whole
plethora
of
governmental
conditions
imposed
in
contracts,
the
walsh-healey
act,
the
anti-kickback
provisions
of
every
kind
and
type
of
the
many
that
the
government
imposes.
and
every
single
item
in
that
contract
was
subject
to
the
conditions
set
forth
and
yet
appellant
would
have
us
believe
that
these
can
be
severed,
these
can
tossed
up
after
one
side,
that
they
have
no
necessary
relation
to
each
other
merely
because
the
same
product
to
be
sold
to
the
same
person
in
the
same
quality,
subject
to
the
same
contractual
conditions
was
to
be
delivered
part
in
one
place
and
part
in
another.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
strictly
artificial
device
of
attempting
to
sever
this
merely
to
avoid
the
payment
of
the
tax.
and
i
think
the
court
should
view
the
contract
to
furnish
gasoline
to
the
government
by
utah
oil
both
within
and
without
the
state
of
idaho
as
a
whole
because
i
can
see
no
valid
or
logical
reason
for
severance
other
than
the
artificial
one
of
hoping
to
avoid
the
tax.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
was
just
coming
to
that
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
state
that
appellant
is
a
corporation
licensed
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
idaho
which
supplies
no
necessary
connection
in
and
of
itself,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court.
appellant,
however,
is
also
a
licensed
dealer
which
status
it
sought
voluntarily
and
while
it
is
not
an
issue
here,
i
would
state
that
the
idaho
statutes
merely
provide
that
one
may
obtain
such
status
by
paying
a
flat
fee
of
$5.
it
is
does
not
vary.
and
upon
this
basis
mr.
justice
goldberg,
as
you
point
out
of
the
idaho
court
appeared
to
hang
it
decision
that
there
was
sufficient
connection
or
sufficient
nexus
of
this
--
i
would
say,
appears
on
the
surface
and
perhaps
it
was
unfortunate
language
by
the
court.
but
i
think
the
court
meant
more
in
its
decisions
actually
when
it's
--
then
just
that
it
was
a
licensed
dealer.
because
i
think
the
contract
in
the
record
here
disclosed
the
more
far-flung
operations
of
utah
oil
successor
to
appellant
here
in
idaho,
it
was
furnishing
gasoline
within
idaho
at
points
varied
over
landscape
by
substantial
distances.
unfortunately,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
the
precise
number,
if
any,
or
miles
of
pipeline
that
the
appellant
owns
in
idaho,
the
tank
farms
that
it
owns
and
operates,
if
any,
the
number
of
service
stations
it
owns
and
operates,
the
amount
of
rolling
stock
it
owns
and
operates
in
the
state
--
all
of
these
things
i
suggest
related
directly
to
the
sale
of
its
petroleum
products.
but
i
would
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
appellant's
contention
in
its
brief,
that
the
majority
of
appellant's
petroleum
business
were
done
outside
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
well
as
i
say,
the
record
is
controversial
on
that
point
mr.
justice.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
this
court
should.
i
point
out
the
conflict
in
the
record
to
indicate
some
substantiation
of
my
contention
that
this
is
a
paper
or
a
wash
transaction
which
this
court
has
struck
down
in
cases
like
scripto
as
an
example.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
there
are
none,
your
honor
except
in
the
pleadings
in
the
trial
court,
affidavit
wise.
affidavits
by
mr.
p.
g.
neill
and
mr.
robert
bakes,
b-a-k-e-s,
and
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
the
direct
citation
of
that
in
the
record.
a
state
gasoline
tanks
levied
so
much
per
galloon
and
used
for
construction
and
maintenance
in
--
of
highways,
we
contend
this
is
not
unconstitutional
even
when
imposed
upon
gasoline
used
by
vehicles
in
interstate
commerce
is
we
take
it
to
be
clear.
we
also
suggest
that
such
taxes
are
neither
unusual
nor
exotic
every
state
in
the
federal
government
have
in.
we
also
take
the
state
may
reach
beyond
its
borders
and
tax
transaction.
if
sufficient
connection
or
nexus
exists
between
the
person
taxed
and
the
taxing
state,
and
as
this
court
stated
in
scripto,
some
definite
link,
some
minimum
connection
between
the
state
and
the
person,
property
or
transaction,
it
seeks
to
tax
must
exist.
and
such
a
connection,
it
is
our
contention
certainly
exists
in
this
instant
factual
situation,
put
in
other
way
the
cases
asked,
what
benefits
--
what
opportunities
has
the
state
afforded
this
person
or
company
it
seeks
to
tax,
an
appellant
raises
the
same
question,
and
i
would
answer
that
in
this.
first,
appellant
sought
and
gained
a
license
dealer
status
which
the
idaho
courts
states
authorized
the
appellant
to
engage
in
the
very
activity
which
it
now
claims
to
be
exempt
in
the
tax.
and
secondly,
appellant
imports
gas
in
idaho.
it
sells
gas
in
idaho.
this
tax
it
seeks
to
avoid
is
a
constitutionally
dedicated
tax
which
must
be
used
for
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
highways.
and
without
such
highways,
i
suggest
to
this
court,
the
appellant's
product
would
have
no
value,
no
usage
within
the
state
of
idaho
nor
could
it
benefit
him
to
import
it
into
idaho.
thirdly,
it
imported
a
portion
of
the
gasoline
which
it
sold
to
the
government
within
the
state
of
idaho
over
these
very
same
highways
for
which
this
tax
is
imposed.
and
fourthly,
the
gasoline
was
destined
for
and
used
to
propel
vehicles
in
commercial
use
over
these
very,
again,
idaho
highways.
appellant
stated
that
a
large
part
of
its
case
rests
on
norton.
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
substantial
differences
between
norton
and
this
case
here.
in
norton,
the
company
shipping
into
the
state
as
the
court
observed
manufactured
some
225,000
different
items
which
were
ordered
by
mail
and
it
also
maintained
a
wholesale
house
so
to
speak
in
chicago.
and
it
sold
these
items
through
the
mail
to
a
myriad
of
customs.
here,
one
seller,
one
product,
one
purchaser
and
i
suggest
that
if
the
court
that
it
had
before
in
norton,
a
factual
situation
where
it
had
been
one
company
dealing
in
product
and
selling
to
one
customer
that
the
result
in
norton
might
have
been
different.
i
would
suggest
that
very
probably
the
language
of
mr.
justice
clark
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
black
and
douglas
in
that
norton
case
is
extremely
applicable
here
in
view
of
the
government's
attempt
to
assist
this
corporation
in
avoiding
its
tax.
i
would
suggest
utah
oil
company
and
american
oil
company
forward
in
this
language
wherein
the
--
those
dissenting
justices
said
in
their
point,
“in
maintaining
a
local
establishment
of
such
magnitude,
petitioner
has
adopted
the
label
of
home-town
merchant.
after
it
has
received
the
manifold
advantages
of
that
label,
we
could
not
give
our
sanction
to
its
claim
made
at
taxpaying
time
that
with
respect
to
direct
sales
it
is
only
an
itinerant
drummer”.
i
think
that
language
is
applicable
here.
i
think
the
decision
of
the
idaho
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
yes.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
you
said
placing
tax
on
the
government?
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
where
the
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
i
would
say
there
are
none
permitted,
none
that
are
permitted,
your
honor.
this
tax
is
not
imposed
on
the
government.
it
is
not
a
sales
tax.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
probably
king
&
boozer
--
there
is
language
in
king
&
boozer
which
would
permit
that.
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
oh,
i
would
say
that
the
rationale
of
king
versus
boozer
is
not
necessary
restricted
--
mr.
allan
g.
shepard
--
to
sales
and
use
tax.
