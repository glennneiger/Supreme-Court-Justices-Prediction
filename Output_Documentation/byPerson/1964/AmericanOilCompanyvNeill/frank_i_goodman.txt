mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
idaho
may
constitutionally
tax
the
transaction
in
which
gasoline
is
sold
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
in
another
state,
utah,
for
use
by
the
commission
in
the
taxing
state,
idaho.
we
say
that
it
cannot.
in
a
nutshell,
our
position
is
this.
if
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
is
upon
the
seller,
as
both
parties
agree
that
it
is,
then
the
tax
violates
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
every
act
which
the
seller
performed
in
connection
with
this
transaction
was
performed
outside
the
state
of
idaho.
and
the
transaction
itself
was
in
no
way
related
to
any
of
the
seller's
activities
within
idaho.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
were
regarded
as
a
use
tax
with
the
legal
incidence
falling
upon
the
purchaser,
then
in
that
case,
the
tax
would
be
invalid
for
a
different
reason,
namely
because
in
this
case,
the
purchaser
was
the
united
states
government
which
enjoys
a
constitutional
immunity
from
such
taxation.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
none
whatever.
that
--
well,
the
permit
authorized
the
seller
in
this
case
to
distribute
gasoline
in
the
state
of
utah.
that
is
to
say
yes
--
it
authorizes
the
same
kind
of
business
that
this
was
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
seller
to
have
that
permit
in
order
to
make
this
sale.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it's
our
position.
i
don't
understand
it
to
be
disputed.
there's
no
expressed
concession
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
don't
think
that
appears,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it's
true
that
that
was
one
of
the
alternative
form
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
to
which
this
bid
was
submitted.
now,
whether
or
not
everyone
who
submitted
a
bid
would've
had
to
be
a
seller
in
idaho,
i
don't
know.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
all
bids
had
to
be
submitted
in
alternative
form
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
with
alternative
f.o.b.,
the
installation
site,
the
point
of
destination
and
the
other
alternative,
the
seller's
bulk
plan.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no
your
honor,
i
now
realize
the
answer
to
whatever
in
idaho.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
no,
i'm
wrong,
you're
right.
in
order
to
have
made
a
delivery
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
to
the
aec
at
its
installation
in
idaho,
i
suppose
it
would've
had
to
have
a
permit.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
but
of
course,
the
invitation
for
bids
in
this
case
provided
that
in
each
case,
the
contract
would
be
awarded
to
that
bidder
whose
bid
was
most
advantageous
to
the
government.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
bid
which
would
be
most
advantageous
to
the
government
would
be
the
one
which
didn't
include
the
tax
namely,
the
one
which
was
not
made
for
delivery
at
the
installation
site.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no
your
honor,
that
is
not
true.
that
is
alleged
in
the
appellee's
brief
but
i
think
that
is
inaccurate
as
we
show
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief.
i'd
be
glad
to
go
into
that
when
i
reach
that
point
in
my
argument.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
quite
simple
and
for
the
most
part,
except
for
the
point
you've
mentioned,
your
honor,
are
undisputed.
the
seller
was
the
utah
oil
refining
company
which
the
predecessor
in
interest
of
the
american
oil
company,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
which
was
substituted
as
a
plaintiff
during
the
litigation
below.
utah
oil
was
a
delaware
corporation
with
its
principle
office
in
salt
lake
city,
utah.
it
was
licensed
to
do
business
in
idaho
and
in
fact
did
business
in
idaho
as
well
as
in
other
states.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
when
was
it
filed?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
think
last
monday,
a
week
ago
today,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
transaction
which
idaho
seeks
to
tax
came
about
in
the
following
way.
the
general
services
administration
issued
an
invitation
to
bid
--
forbids
to
supply
the
motor
fuel
requirements
for
one
year
of
various
government
agencies
in
a
four
state
area,
idaho,
montana,
washington,
and
oregon.
the
invitation
was
issued
in
seattle,
washington
which
was
the
gsa's
regional
headquarters.
it
included
some
607
separate
items
and
it
provided
that
the
bid
on
each
item
would
be
treated
as
an
independent
offer
which
the
government
could
accept
or
reject
on
its
own
merits
without
regard
to
its
action
on
other
items.
the
particular
items
involved
in
this
case
are
number
63
and
64
which
appear
on
page
195
i
think,
or
rather
page
95
of
the
record.
and
they
called
for
delivery
of
200,000
gallons
and
one
million
gallons
respectively
for
use
of
the
national
reactor
testing
station
which
is
a
large
aec
facility
in
idaho
falls,
idaho.
utah
oil
submitted
formal
bids
on
about
75
items
and
the
government
accepted
its
bids
on
11
items
including
the
two
involved
in
this
case.
the
bids
were
submitted
in
salt
lake
city
and
they
were
accepted
by
the
government
in
seattle.
as
i've
indicated,
the
bids
were
submitted
in
alternative
form
and
the
bid
which
the
government
accepted
was
the
bid
f.o.b.,
the
seller's
both
plans
in
salt
lake
city.
the
contract
was
performed
according
to
its
terms.
the
goods
were
delivered
by
--
the
gas
was
delivered
by
the
seller
at
its
both
plans
in
salt
lake
city
to
carriers
selected
by
the
government
and
paid
by
the
government
or
by
the
government's
contracting
agent,
phillips
petroleum
company.
both
courts
below
held
the
title
pass
to
the
purchaser
in
utah
and
it's
quite
clear
i
think
that
the
purchaser
bore
the
risk
of
loss
and
transit.
in
short,
i
don't
think
it
will
be
disputed
that
utah
oil
company
had
fully
performed
its
contract
with
respect
to
each
shipment
while
the
goods
were
still
in
utah.
when
the
gas
arrived
in
idaho,
it
was
placed
in
storage
tanks
owned
by
the
government
and
eventually
it
was
consumed
in
government
owned
vehicles
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
government
employees
to
and
from
the
national
reactor
testing
station.
this
transportation
operation
was
actually
handled
by
phillips
petroleum
company
pursuant
to
its
management
contract
with
the
government.
but
the
fares
collected
from
the
passengers
were
paid
over
to
the
government
and
the
losses
regularly
incurred
in
the
operation
where
was
absorbed
by
the
government.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
with
the
exception
of
two
vehicles
which
were
leased,
they
were
owned
by
the
government,
yes
your
honor.
now
the
idaho
tax
is
not
easily
to
classify
in
any
of
the
traditional
categories.
the
statute
imposes
an
excise
tax,
which
was
called
by
the
statute
an
excise
tax
of
$0.6
per
gallon
on
all
gasoline
which
is
received
by
idaho
licensed
dealers,
that
is
by
dealers
who
hold
the
permit
to
distribute
gasoline
within
idaho.
the
tax
is
payable
as
i
say
on
all
gasoline
which
those
dealers
received.
but
the
term
received
is
given
a
rather
peculiar
definition
by
the
statute.
the
statute
provides
among
other
things
that
whenever
gasoline
is
sold
or
supplied
by
any
licensed
dealer
for
importation
into
the
state
of
idaho
from
the
point
of
origin
outside
the
state,
then
it
is
considered
to
be
received
by
the
licensed
dealer
immediately
after
it
is
unloaded
by
the
purchaser
in
idaho.
now
pursuant
to
that
provision,
the
idaho
tax
collector
demanded
that
utah
oil
pay
the
tax
and
it
paid
the
tax
under
protest,
and
filed
a
suit
for
refund
in
the
idaho
courts.
the
idaho
trial
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
think
it
clearly
does
your
honor
and
this
was
held
to
apply
by
the
idaho
supreme
court.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
was
received
by
utah
when
the
aec
unloaded
it
in
idaho.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
idaho
trial
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
utah
oil
holding
that
the
tax
was
invalid
under
the
commerce
and
due
process
clauses
because
of
its
extraterritorial
character.
but
the
idaho
supreme
court
reversed
holding
that
the
fact
that
utah
oil
held
a
valid
dealer's
permit
in
idaho
gave
the
state
the
sufficient
nexus
to
justify
taxing
this
transaction.
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
first
is
that
this
is
not
a
use
tax.
the
parties
agreed
that
it's
a
privilege
tax,
the
incidence
of
which
is
upon
this
seller
rather
than
the
purchaser.
and
unlike
the
typical
use
tax
statute,
it
neither
requires
nor
authorizes
the
dealer
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
purchaser.
the
attorney
general
of
idaho
has
twice
issued
formal
rulings
holding
that
this
tax
is
on
the
dealer
and
the
trial
--
idaho
trial
court
in
this
case
so
ruled
specifically.
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
did
not
speak
directly
to
this
point
but
i
think
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
there
are
strong
intimations
in
its
opinion
that
it
too
regarded
the
tax
as
on
the
dealer.
so
in
this
oral
argument,
i'm
going
to
assume
that
the
tax
is
on
the
dealer.
in
our
brief,
we
elaborate
the
reasons
why
the
tax
would
also
be
invalid
under
the
principle
of
mcculloch
versus
maryland
if
it
were
viewed
as
a
tax
upon
the
purchaser
for
the
use
of
the
gasoline
in
idaho.
in
that
regard,
the
claim
is
made
that
the
real
purchaser
here
was
phillips
petroleum
company
and
not
the
government
and
that
the
government
was
merely
acting
as
a
sort
of
purchasing
agent
for
phillips
when
it
brought
the
gasoline.
we
deal
with
that
contention
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief
which
i
see
is
now
have
been
distributed
to
the
members
of
the
court.
here,
i
would
only
say
this
that
the
parties
are
in
agreement
or
at
least
it's
not
disputed
that
the
purchase
price
of
this
gasoline
was
paid
by
the
government
not
by
phillips.
and
that
alone,
i
should
think,
would
be
decisive
of
who
the
purchaser
was.
beyond
that,
as
i
said,
it
was
consumed
in
government
owned
vehicles,
stored
in
government
owned
tanks,
and
used
in
a
operation
which
regularly
incurred
a
loss
which
the
government
absorbed.
so
to
say
that
the
government
in
buying
this
gas
was
acting
as
phillips'
as
agent
is
simply
to
turn
the
relationship
of
the
parties
upside
down.
the
idaho
supreme
court
recognized
that,
stated
that
it
was
--
wasn't
necessary
to
consider
the
role
of
phillips
in
this
transaction
because
phillips
was
merely
acting
as
the
government's
agent
in
everything
that
it
did.
the
basic
principle
which
we
think
governs
this
case
is
that
a
state
may
not
tax
transactions
or
activities
which
occur
outside
of
its
borders.
in
this
case,
every
activity
in
which
the
seller
participated,
took
place
outside
the
borders
of
idaho.
the
government
solicited
bids
originally
in
salt
lake
--
in
seattle,
washington.
the
bids
were
submitted
in
salt
lake
city,
utah.
bids
were
accepted
in
seattle,
washington.
the
gasoline
was
delivered
to
carriers
selected
and
paid
by
the
government
in
utah
and
title
passed
in
utah.
in
other
words,
every
act
performed
by
this
seller
in
the
course
of
soliciting,
negotiating,
executing,
and
performing
the
contract
was
extraterritorial
as
far
as
idaho
was
concerned
and
was
in
no
way
dependent
upon
any
privilege
conferred
by
the
state
of
idaho.
now,
the
argument
is
made
by
the
state
that
they're
entitled
to
tax
this
transaction
because
idaho
did
other
business
or
rather
because
utah
oil
did
other
business
in
the
state
of
idaho,
and
was
licensed
to
do
business
there.
and
we
think
that
contention
is
refuted
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
established
the
principle
that
when
a
state
taxes
a
corporation
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
within
its
borders,
it
may
not
include
within
the
measure
of
that
tax
any
interstate
transaction
or
out
of
state
transaction
which
does
not
involve
any
activities
within
the
state
and
which
is
no
way
related
or
dependent
upon
any
activities
within
the
state.
that
principle
was
laid
down
in
norton
versus
illinois
and
we
think
was
reaffirmed
by
this
court
last
term
in
general
motors
versus
washington.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
correct
an
answer
i
gave
yesterday
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
justice
white's
question
was
whether
or
not
a
supplier
who
wished
to
bid
for
this
aec
business
was
required
to
submit
two
bids
in
alternative
form.
one
based
upon
delivery
at
the
seller's
bulk
plant
and
the
other
based
upon
delivery
at
the
installation
site
in
idaho.
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
i
believe,
that
if
that
were
true,
then
sooner
or
later
the
supplier
would
be
required
to
get
an
idaho
dealer’s
license.
if
not
in
order
to
submit
his
bid
then
at
least
an
order
to
perform
the
contract
if
it
were
awarded
to
him
on
the
basis
of
delivery
in
idaho.
the
answer
to
the
question,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white
is
“no”.
there's
no
requirement
in
this
contract
by
either
expressed
or
implied
which
requires
the
bids
be
submitted
in
that
alternative
form.
and
in
the
absence
of
such
requirement,
i
think
its
clear
that
they
need
not
be.
item
63
and
64
which
are
the
two
aec
items
involved
here,
each
comprise
two
sub-items,
a
and
b.
sub-item
a
in
each
case
invites
a
bid
f.o.b.
the
bulk
plant.
sub-item
b,
invites
a
bid
f.o.b.
the
installation
site
in
idaho.
just
as
a
supplier
is
free
to
bid
on
anyone
or
more
of
the
items
in
the
invitation
without
having
to
bid
on
all
600
of
them,
by
the
same
token
he’s
free
to
bid
on
either
of
these
two
sub-items
without
necessarily
having
to
bid
on
both
of
them
unless
he
chooses
to
do
so.obviously,
it
would
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
seller
to
bid
on
both
them
if
they
were
in
a
position
to
because
that
would
give
him
two
strings
to
his
bow.
but
there's
no
indication
in
the
contract
that
the
government
would
turn
down
the
low
bid
if
were
say
on
item
--
sub-item
a
merely
because
it
were
not
accompanied
by
another
bid
on
sub-item
b.
the
upshot
of
this
is
that
even
if
utah
oil
company
had
never
done
a
dollars
worth
of
business
in
idaho
and
did
not
hold
an
idaho
dealer’s
permit,
it
could
still
a
bid
for
this
contract
and
it
would
still
have
been
awarded
this
contract
f.o.b.
its
bulk
plant
in
utah.
so
insofar
as
this
transaction
is
concerned,
the
state
of
idaho
has
given
the
seller
no
benefit
for
which
it
can
reasonably
demand
compensation.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
it
did
bid.
but
it
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no.
it
did
bid.
it
happened
to
bid
on
the
alternative
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
(voice
overlap)
it
submitted
its
bid,
f.o.b.
--
one
bid,
f.o.b.
utah
and
another
bid
f.o.b.
installation
site
in
idaho.
my
point
is
that
it
was
not
required
to
do
so
and
it
could
if
simply
submitted
a
bid
f.o.b.
utah
and
that
bid
presumably
would
have
been
accepted.
and
the
argument
is
made
that
idaho
is
entitled
to
tax
this
transaction
because
the
seller
does
other
business
within
the
state
of
idaho.
as
i
was
saying
yesterday
when
time
ran
out,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly,
the
norton
case
and
the
general
motors
case
made
it
clear
that
when
a
state
taxes
a
corporation
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
within
its
borders,
it
may
not
include
within
the
measure
of
that
tax
any
interstate
or
out
of
state
transactions,
which
do
not
grow
out
of
activities
of
the
seller
within
the
state
and
which
are
wholly
dissociated
from
any
such
activities.
the
burden
of
proof
rests
upon
the
taxpayer
to
demonstrate
this
dissociation
or
lack
of
relationship
and
in
the
general
motors
case,
the
court
concluded
that
the
taxpayer
failed
to
meet
that
burden.
so
the
majority
of
the
court
held
in
the
general
motors
case
that
the
state
of
washington
was
entitled
to
tax
general
motors
on
the
unapportioned
gross
receipts
from
all
of
its
sales
to
dealers
in
washington.
including
those
sales
in
which
the
dealers
simply
said
its
order
to
gm's
zone
headquarters
in
portland,
oregon
and
received
shipment
directly
from
portland.
but
the
basis
for
that
holding,
if
i
understand
it,
was
that
general
motors
had
within
the
state
of
washington
resident
sales
representatives
who
worked
with
the
dealers
and
who
helped
them
to
strengthen
their
sales
organizations
and
expand
their
markets
and
those
in
state
activities
indirectly
contributed
to
the
very
sales
which
the
state
of
idaho
was
trying
to
--
which
the
state
of
washington
was
trying
to
tax.
now,
in
the
present
case,
there's
no
such
relationship
between
the
sale
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
any
activities
which
utah
oil
may
have
been
conducting
within
the
state
of
idaho.
it's
quite
clear
that
this
sale
owed
nothing
to
those
activities.
it
is
true
that
utah
oil
made
deliveries
within
idaho
to
some
of
the
other
government
agencies
under
other
items
contained
in
the
same
invitation
for
bids.
but
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
the
aec
transaction
was
totally
unrelated
to
all
of
those
other
items.
the
government
could
have
accepted
the
bid
for
aec
business
and
rejected
all
of
the
others
or
could
have
accepted
the
others
and
rejected
this
bid.
and
undoubtedly,
it
would
have
done
so
had
each
been
--
bid
not
been
the
most
advantageous
one
from
the
government’s
standpoint
on
its
own
individual
merits.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
the
--
the
bid
f.o.b.
installation
site
in
idaho
included
the
tax,
the
bid
f.o.b.
bulk
plant
in
utah
excluded
the
tax.
i
would
point
out
too
that
the
contract
for
the
aec
business
was
not
awarded
even
at
the
same
time
as
the
awards
for
the
other
items.
the
other
items
were
all
awarded
on
september
15,
1959
whereas
the
aec
contract
was
awarded
43
days
later
on
october
28th.
in
our
replied
brief
on
page
4,
i
believe,
we
inaccurately
stated
that
the
time
difference
between
the
two
awards
was
two
days.that
should
have
been
43
days.
finally,
i
would
note
that
all
of
the
other
items
contained
in
this
invitation
for
bids
involved
relatively
trivial
amounts
of
gasoline
compared
to
the
amounts
involved
here.
the
nine
other
items
which
were
awarded
to
utah
oil
company
under
this
invitation
involved
a
grand
total
of
18,000
gallons
of
gasoline
whereas
our
--
our
single
aec
transaction
involves
60
times
that
much
--
1,200,000
galloons.
and
we
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
utah
oil
had
earlier
been
awarded
contracts
to
make
relatively
small
sales
to
other
government
agencies
at
other
locations
within
the
state
of
idaho,
in
no
way
gives
the
state
the
right
to
tax
this
transaction
which
was
unrelated
to
those
others
in
which
involved
no
activities
within
the
state
of
idaho.
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
shepard
has
confused
two
quite
different
issues.
the
first
issue
is
where
the
gas
was
delivered.
we
say
that
it
was
delivered
in
utah.
it
makes
no
difference
whatever
to
that
issue
whether
the
party
to
whom
it
was
delivered
was
the
phillips
petroleum
company
or
the
united
states,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
commerce
clause
or
of
the
due
process
clause,
the
important
point
is
that
the
delivery
was
made
outside
of
the
taxing
state.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
justice
white,
i
know
frankly
of
no
cases
either
way
on
the
question
of
whether
delivery
alone
within
a
state
provides
sufficient
justification
for
taxing
the
transaction
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
i
simply
cannot
think
of
any
case
which
bears
on
that
question.
so,
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
you
would.
that's
correct.
and
all
of
the
cases
that
i
can
think
of
where
sales
taxes
were
sustained
upon
the
dealer,
upon
the
seller,
there
was
more
activity
within
the
taxing
state
in
particular
where
there
was
solicitation
within
the
taxing
state
to
justify
the
imposition
of
the
tax.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
of
course,
we
say
that
that's
absurd.
it
wasn't
a
sham.
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
know
what
the
word
sham
means
in
these
circumstances.
it's
quite
true
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
it's
true
that
the
government
accepted
the
low
bid
in
this
case
and
the
bid
was
low
partly
because
of
the
fact
that
it
didn't
have
a
tax
included
within
it.
that
incidentally
was
not
the
only
reason
it
was
low.
the
bid
would
have
been
low
even
if
it
had
included
the
tax
though
this
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
on
this
question
of
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
concede
that.
that
statement
is
made
and
one
of
the
affidavit
submitted
by
the
appellees
and
that's
the
only
evidence
they
have
in
the
record.
we
do
not
concede
that
to
be
true.
now,
as
far
as
phillips
petroleum
company
is
concerned,
the
question
of
whether
phillips
or
the
government
was
the
purchaser
of
this
gasoline
and
the
owner
of
this
gasoline
after
it
was
purchased
becomes
relevant
only
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
tax
upon
the
purchaser
rather
and
upon
the
dealer.
and
both
parties
have
agreed
that
it
is
a
tax
on
the
dealer.
our
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same
if
the
tax
--
if
the
sale
had
been
made
to
someone
other
than
the
government.
it
depends
on
in
no
respect
upon
the
doctrine
of
governmental
immunity
so
long
as
the
tax
is
regarded
as
a
tax
upon
the
dealer.
and
i
would
--
i
would
say
this
too
with
respect
to
this
question
of
tax
avoidance.
we
do
not
deny
that
the
state
of
idaho
has
power
to
impose
a
tax
upon
phillips
petroleum
company
for
its
participation
in
this
overall
transaction.
undoubtedly,
phillips
does
in
a
sense
used
the
gasoline
for
its
own
profit-making
interest
and
i
would
suppose
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
union
carbide
case,
the
state
of
idaho
could
impose
a
tax
upon
phillips.
this
is
not
such
a
tax.
its
not
a
claim
that's
being
imposed
upon
phillips
and
even
it
were
imposed
upon
phillips,
the
state
of
idaho
could
not
require
this
taxpayer
utah
oil
refining
company
to
collect
the
tax
from
phillips
because
utah
oil
had
no
dealings
with
phillips,
it
receives
no
money
from
phillips,
it
has
no
way
of
obtaining
reimbursement
from
phillips
for
any
amounts
which
it
is
required
to
pay
over
to
the
state.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
could
tax
the
phillips
petroleum
company,
i
would
suppose
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
you
couldn't
tax
united
states,
no.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
it
could
tax
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
oh,
yes.
it
could
tax
any
private
purchaser
for
the
use
of
the
gasoline.
mr.
justice
stewart
in
reply
to
your
question
awhile
ago
about
the
circumstances
of
the
earlier
incidents
in
which
the
government
has
said
to
have
tried
to
evade
the
tax,
the
facts
in
those
cases
were
that
the
sales
were
being
made
within
idaho
by
idaho
sellers
to
the
united
states.
and
the
department
of
agriculture
originally
took
the
position
that
the
idaho
tax
was
a
tax
upon
the
government
and
therefore
could
not
be
imposed.
the
attorney
general
of
idaho
then
issued
a
ruling
that
the
tax
was
on
the
dealer
not
upon
purchaser.
the
comptroller
general
agreed
and
therefore
permitted
the
tax
to
be
paid.
now,
the
state
of
idaho
wants
it
the
other
way
too.
it
wants
to
say
that
it
can
even
impose
the
tax
from
the
dealer
as
an
out-of-state
dealer.
one
further
point,
the
state
of
idaho
relies
rather
heavily
in
its
briefs
and
in
this
oral
argument
too,
upon
a
series
of
cases
ending
with
scripto
versus
carson,
a
series
of
use
tax
cases
in
which
it
is
true,
the
court
has
intimated
that
a
state
may
require
an
out-of-state
seller
to
collect
for
it
a
use
tax
imposed
upon
the
in-state
user
so
long
as
there
is
some
sort
of
nexus
with
the
taxpayer,
not
necessarily
with
the
particular
transaction.
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
it
could
impose
a
tax
upon
the
out-of-state
dealer
himself
by
virtue
of
transactions
other
than
the
one
which
is
sought
to
be
taxed.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white.
in
the
norton
--
in
the
norton
case,
the
deliveries
were
made
in
illinois.
the
carriers
were
selected
by
the
--
by
the
seller,
massachusetts
seller.
so,
so
that
would
be
a
case
in
which
the
delivery
constituted
a
nexus
between
the
taxing
state
and
the
transaction.
yet,
this
court
held
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
couldn't
be
tax.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
but
the
--
even
the
direct
sales
from
massachusetts
to
illinois
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
they
were
exempted,
but
deliveries
were
made
within
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
sense
that
the
--
it
was
the
seller
rather
than
the
buyer
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
who
chose
the
carrier
and
paid
the
transportation
charges.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
so
that
would
be
an
example
of
the
kind
of
case
you
have
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
because
we
think
that
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
perhaps
not
your
honor,
but
the
fact
is
that
delivery
was
made
outside
the
state
and
that
without
more
certainly
makes
this
an
extraterritorial
transaction.
