mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
put
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case
in
its
proper
perspective
and
in
order
to
put
the
questions
actually
presented
by
this
case
in
their
proper
perspective
i
beg
to
leave
the
court
to
refer
just
briefly
that
some
of
their
real
facts
of
this
case
that
has
yet
been
developed
from
an
undisputed
record.
the
record
in
this
case
consists
in
the
main,
if
it
please
the
court,
of
exhibits
and
testimony
introduced
into
this
case
by
the
petitioners
themselves
mainly
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
in
other
words
testimony
by
the
president
of
the
whitney
national
bank
of
new
orleans,
sworn
affidavits
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
other
documents
which
have
been
filed
in
this
case
by
the
petitioners.
now,
these
facts,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
whitney
national
bank
of
new
orleans
is
the
largest
bank
by
far
in
the
entire
state
of
louisiana.
it's
one
of
the
largest
things
in
the
entire
southern
portion
of
the
united
states.
for
approximately
80
years,
whitney
has
operated
its
offices
limited
to
the
confines
of
the
city
of
new
orleans,
parish
of
orleans.
orleans
parish
being
the
same
territorial
limitation
as
the
city
of
new
orleans.
through
these
operations
which
are
admittedly
and
concededly
in
this
case
properly
restricted
by
a
combination
of
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act
and
louisiana
revised
statute
654
to
the
limits
of
new
orleans.
whitney
has
grown
to
a
position
of
banking
dominance
where
it
controls
approximately
$500
million
in
resources
approximately
$14
million
in
undivided
profit
and
approximately
$27,200
in
a
surplus
account.
whitney-new
orleans
with
these
constitutional
proper
limit
--
limitations
prescribed
by
the
congress
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
admittedly
still
fully
applicable
today
has
accumulated
at
its
bank
in
new
orleans,
its
original
bank
in
the
12
branches,
39%
of
the
total
deposits
in
all
banks
in
orleans
parish.
it
has
also
accumulated
approximately
44%
of
all
deposits
of
individuals,
partnership,
and
corporations
in
the
parish.
now,
just
as
in
the
side
comparing
notes
figured
with
the
figures
that
were
presented
to
this
court
by
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
if
the
merger
which
this
court
struck
down
has
been
approved,
it
would
have
involved
approximately
30%
of
the
banking
business
in
philadelphia
that
is
that
the
merger
is
going
through.
here,
before
the
plan
which
is
even
proposed,
has
even
going
into
effect
whitney
already
controls
approximately
40
to
44%
of
the
business
available
in
new
orleans.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
it's
overwhelming
important,
your
honor,
because
of
course
the
size
of
this
bank
as
it
poses
this
threat
of
unlawful
competition
to
the
respondents
in
this
case,
is
an
extremely
relevant
fact.
in
other
words
the
respondents
in
this
case
based
their
standing
to
sue
upon
the
contention
of
an
unlawful
competition
which
will
be
turned
lose
by
the
largest
bank
in
the
entire
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that
could
be
true,
that
could
true.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
would
say
that
it
is
correct
that
if
a
small
bank
were
precluded
from
going
into
jefferson
parish
by
a
combination
of
section
36
in
louisiana
law,
it
too
like
all
the
other
banks
in
louisiana,
would
be
precluded.
but
i'm
mentioning
this
to
your
honor
solely
because
this
does
go
right
to
the
heart
of
the
type
of
competition
which
louisiana
was
considering
when
it
adopted
the
legislation
we
have
been
discussing
through
the
petitioner's
oral
arguments
here
today.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
question,
your
honor
that
the
federal
reserve
could
or
should
have
taken
into
consideration
but
if
again
here
it's
just
a
matter
of
complete
background
to
the
type
of
competition
which
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
confronted
with.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no
your
honor.
this
argument
is
more
relevant
to
the
question
of
standing
to
sue
here
which
we're
going
to
be
getting
into
when
i
approach
it
because
it's
a
type
of
competition,
the
type
of
destructive
unlawful
competition
which
does
confront
the
respondents
in
--
in
this
case
and
indicate
--
should
indicate
why
the
statutes
have
been
passed.
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act
in
the
louisiana
statutes,
these
are
really
antitrust
statutes
in
essence
which
were
passed
to
limit
these
banks
to
the
confines
of
their
own,
the
certain
confines
in
order
to
keep
them
from
expanding
throughout
a
state
and
taking
away
the
business
of
the
other
banks.
some
states
for
example
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
can't
branch
at
all
such
as
in
illinois
and
these
statutes
have
been
passed
to
keep
banks
from
just
becoming
big
and
spreading
throughout
the
state.
but
as
i
say,
it
would
apply
your
honor
to
whether
if
you
were
a
large
or
a
small
bank
but
in
this
case
the
injury
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
this
is
the
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
now,
as
indicated
by
the
petitioners
in
their
opening
arguments,
it
is
conceded
that
whitney
national
is
absolutely
prohibited
from
going
over
into
jefferson
parish
to
open
banking
offices.
the
stipulation
is
contained
in
both
petitioners
briefs
and
as
i
understood
the
argument
made
by
mr.
spritzer
this
morning
it's
absolutely
conceived
that
whitney-new
orleans
there's
no
statutory
right
of
any
kind
to
leave
the
confines
of
new
orleans
and
open
any
banking
offices
in
jefferson
parish
and
nevertheless
as
pointed
out
by
the
government
this
morning,
whitney
is
still,
whitney-new
orleans
has
still
been
exceedingly
desire
over
a
long
period
of
years
of
leaving
new
orleans
and
opening
banking
offices
in
jefferson
parish.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
say
this
your
honor
that
they
actually
did
consider
getting
an
affiliate
and
the
president
of
whitney-new
orleans
actually
was
shown
to
testify
that
they
rejected
the
affiliate
arrangement
because
it
was
--
they
couldn't
hold
on
to
it
and
necessarily
i
think
that
was
the
type
of
testimony
he
gave.
he
said
an
affiliate
does
not
become
part
of
our
organization.
it's
just
sort
of
hanging
loosely
to
use
these
words
that
you
have
these
conflicts
of
interest
in
its
office.
so
while
they
actually
did
consider
the
possibility
of
an
affiliate
arrangement,
they
rejected
it
because
it
did
not
have
the
completeness
of
control
and
the
continuity
of
control
that
whitney
wanted
when
it
wanted
to
go
out
in
the
jefferson
parish
with
his
holding
company
approach.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
it
would
involve
some
of
the
stockholders
of
whitney
or
all
of
the
stockholders
of
whitney
going
out
in
the
jefferson
parish
and
raising
new
fresh
capital
of
their
own
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
--
and
putting
that
into
a
new
bank
which
they
would
then
organize.
now,
under
this
holding
company
approach
as
i'm
going
to
show
in
just
a
moment,
the
funds
were
actually
drawn
out
of
whitney-new
orleans
into
the
holding
company
and
then
out
of
the
holding
company
into
the
other
bank
in
jefferson
paris.
so
there
was
that
--
and
of
course
in
the
affiliate
arrangement,
those
two
banks
can
compete
for
the
same
business
and
as
they
point
out
there
are
conflicts
of
interests
between
the
two
banks.
the
bank
in
jefferson
may
compete
for
the
same
business
as
the
bank
in
new
orleans
wants
but
they
are
stopped
by
the
conflicts
of
interest
facing
substantially
the
same
board
of
directors
from
going
after
the
same
business.
so
in
order
to
avoid
all
of
this
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
have
absolute
control
over
the
two
banks
and
in
order
to
have
the
funds
drawn
out
of
whitney-new
orleans
without
the
necessity
of
raising
new
fresh
capital,
they
adopted
as
the
president
of
whitney-new
orleans
testifying,
the
holding
company
approach.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
correct
other
than
(voice
overlap)
other
than
the
absolute
rule
of
law
that
says
the
corporate
forms
will
be
disregarded
when
you
attempt
to
pro
--
to
evade
the
prohibitions
of
a
federal
estate
statute
by
simply
creating
a
corporation
to
get
around
it.
that
couldn't
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes
and
that
the
corporate
bill
should
be
passed
as
this
court
held
in
the
northern
security
case
and
as
solicitor
general
lehmann
said
should
be
done
when
he
wrote
his
opinion
in
1911
which
is
contained
in
our
supplemental
appendix.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
whenever
the
bank
holding
company
does
not
take
the
fund
it
employs
--
let's
start
from
the
beginning,
if
i
might
justice
white.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
as
you
know
held
this
to
be
a
branch
because
it
was
organized
with
the
funds
of
the
first
bank.
that
is
the
--
that
starts
to
change,
in
other
words
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
would
say
anytime
a
banks
sets
out
to
evade
section
36
and
admit
it's
trying
to
evade
section
36
by
forming
a
corporation,
a
holding
company
through
which
it
can
site
it's
own
funds
into
the
opening
of
the
other
office
and
it
intends
to
run
both
that
way
not
with
fresh
funds
invested
by
the
holding
company
but
with
the
banks
own
funds,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
the
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it
would
not
prevent
the
bank
holding
company.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
don't
think
i
can
agree
completely
with
your
honor
on
that.
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
it
feels
that
when
a
bank
sets
out
to
evade
the
branch
restrictions
of
law
solely
by
forming
its
own
holding
company
through
which
it
can
pass
its
own
funds
to
open
the
office
and
nullify
the
law,
yes,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
apply.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
know
of
no
state
law
which
would
approve
such
a
holding
company
operation
your
honor
but
assuming
a
state
law
did
provide
for
the
establishment
of
a
holding
company
to
operate
within
the
limits
of
the
state
law,
i
think
that
would
still
be
open
to
attack
if
--
if
this
type
of
procedure
will
follow
to
evade
and
to
frustrate
and
to
repeal
in
all
effect
section
36
(c)
of
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
don't
think
the
government
because
that
was
given
a
bank
of
choice
your
honor
of
evading
section
36
by
forming
so
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
that's
entirely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that's
why
i'm
reviewing
the
facts
because
i
think
these
facts
established
as
an
undisputed
record
based
on
the
testimony
of
the
petitioners
would
show
i
think
the
unheard
ventures
that
they
set
out
to
do
it.
they
did
it
in
the
most
careful
way.
they
went
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
got
his
advice
and
consent
before
they
move
one
step
down
the
road.
they
operated
with
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
the
whole
way
and
the
sole
purpose
was
to
evade
section
36
and
that's
what
i
say
the
record
in
this
case
does
show
without
any
doubt.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
very
essential
difference
from
the
very
beginning.
in
a
chain
bank,
that
is
the
affiliate
which
was
involved
in
the
camden
trust
case
in
which
i
just
discussed
with
by
justice
stewart.
you
have
the
situation
where
some
of
the
stockholders
or
all
of
the
stockholders,
if
it's
a
small
bank,
set
out
and
raise
new
money,
new
capital
to
form
a
new
bank,
in
other
words,
a
brand
new
bank
which
has
no
direct
connection
with
the
first
bank.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well
branch
bank
that
is
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
we
say
there
is
no
significant
difference,
there
is
no
difference
of
substance,
it's
all
difference
of
form
and
we
--
we
say
then
that
you
should
apply
the
rule
which
has
been
applied
for
years
back
to
the
northern
security
case
that
equity
looks
at
substance
not
form,
that
the
corporate
entities
which
are
established
for
the
purpose
of
evading
a
law,
the
law
looks,
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
going
to
let
the
law
be
frustrated
by
mere
forms
but
it's
going
to
be
governed
entirely
by
the
substance
of
the
transactions.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
say,
that's
correct,
your
honor
that
in
a
branch
bank
situation
obviously
the
--
the
parent
bank
and
the
branch
bank
do
have
to
combine
lending
authority
of
the
two
banks.
in
this
case,
the
testimony
has
been
given
in
the
record
by
mr.
gilly,
the
executive
vice
president
of
this
bank
formerly
the
executive
vice
president
of
whitney-new
orleans
is
also
the
president
of
whitney-jefferson
and
by
mr.
barry
who
is
the
president
of
whitney-new
orleans
that
the
two
banks
would
have
their
combined
deposits
to
work
with
through
the
holding
company,
would
then
have
their
combined
loans
to
be
made
through
the
two,
in
other
words
they'd
share
loans
and
it's
a
very
simple
procedure
to
follow.
if
a
borrower
comes
into
the
bank
out
in
jefferson
parish
and
wants
to
borrow
more
than
the
fixed
--
the
10%
of
the
capital
of
whitney-jefferson,
they
simply
get
an
officer
in
whitney-new
orleans
to
come
in
and
sit
down
with
him
in
the
two
banks
and
share
the
same
loan
so
it's
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no
they
cannot.
as
a
matter
of
form,
they
cannot
but
as
a
matter
of
factual
operations
of
the
two
banks
they
can
and
of
course
intended
to
do.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
say
well
and
that's
one
and
that
is
of
course
true
that
any
two
friendly
banks
can
do
that
but
in
this
case
they
specifically
kept
that
in
mind
and
of
course
using
the
funds
from
one
bank,
the
$650,000
which
was
used
to
establish
whitney-jefferson
is
drawn
right
out
of
whitney-new
orleans
and
put
over
in
whitney-jefferson
so
that
when
they
make
a
loan
out
of
whitney-jefferson,
they're
actually
using
the
funds
originally
from
whitney-new
orleans
to
make
the
loan
anyway.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
there
are
some
differences
but
they
--
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
congressional
proceedings
which
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs
and
they
pointed
out
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
that
would
be
one
of
the
very
bad
vices
of
this
whole
arrangement
that
whitney-new
orleans
can
have
all
of
the
benefits
of
this
branch
relationship
with
this
bank
and
yet
if
it
fails
and
its
depositors
would
be
left
with
its
capital
alone.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that
is
true
too,
your
honor.
so
that
is
the
difference.
but
i
say
that
these
differences,
your
honor,
and
i
say
this
from
--
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
are
differences
without
a
real
distinction.
these
are
differences
in
form.
these
are
differences
which
can
be
circumvented
any
day
in
the
week
that
can
be
dealt
with
any
day
in
the
week
by
the
banks
simply
operating
really
as
one.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
federal
reserve
board
in
this
case
as
the
record
shows
took
the
position
in
a
question
of
section
36
that
is
an
alleged
violation
of
the
branch
restrictions
of
section
36,
it's
not
for
the
board
but
it's
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
its
page
168
of
the
record.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
in
a
letter
rejecting
the
petition
for
reconsideration
of
the
re
--
of
the
respondent
bank.
the
board
took
the
--
you
see
in
this
case,
your
honor,
when
some
of
the
dissenting
stockholders
of
whitney-new
orleans
went
before
the
federal
reserve
board,
the
federal
reserve
board
didn't
hold
a
public
hearing
in
this
case
or
the
statutory
public
hearing
which
is
provided
by
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it's
168
of
the
record.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
--
which
is
administered
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
the
official
of
the
united
states
treasury
department.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it's
not
even
before
the
board.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it's
not
even
before
the
board.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it
was
the
application
for
its
existence
was
pending
before
the
comptroller.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
but
as
a
matter
of
law
it
would
never
be
because
the
application
is
filed
by
the
holding
company
simply
for
the
right
to
acquire
the
stock
of
the
bank
and
of
course
the
federal
reserve
board
in
this
case
actually
after
hearing
the
dissenting
stockholders
of
whitney-new
orleans
who
appeared
before
that
board
and
protested
vigorously
about
this
whole
thing
just
as
we
are
here,
referred
the
whole
questions
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
we
are
before
the
court
is
that
the
comptroller
refused
to
comment
on
these
alleged
violations
of
section
36
to
the
board.
the
board
of
course
taking
the
position
that
they
couldn't
pass
on
alleged
violations
of
section
36
in
having
no
position
from
the
comptroller
of
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
in
addition
they
relate
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
if
there's
in
the
--
in
addition
they
relate
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
that's
correct
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say
in
addition
they
relate
largely
to
an
alleged
violation
of
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act
which
is
administered
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
an
official
of
the
united
states
treasury
department.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well
except
that
no
your
honor
what
they
pass
orders
what
is
right
before
that
it
said
it
is
also
alleged
the
board's
action
though
unnecessarily
placed
into
the
hands
of
federally
charted
banks
a
powerful
and
unfair
competitive
advantage
of
a
state
banks.
it
says
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
those
arguments
are
without
substantial
merit.
then
they
move
on
and
say,
in
addition
they
relate
largely
to
an
alleged
violation
of
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
we
--
we
were
--
we
were
--
i
really
think
what
the
board
meant
what
i
say
the
board
intended
to
mean
your
honors
was
that
we
were
arguing
that
trying
to
get
the
board
to
listen
to
the
fact
that
this
was
in
a
violation
of
section
36
of
national
bank
act
and
the
board
took
the
position
as
they
did
during
the
proceedings
itself
that
this
was
a
question
to
be
resolved
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
they
do
not.
of
course
the
comptroller
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
my
statute
is
the
--
the
national
bank
act
and
all
violations
of
the
national
bank
act
are
exclusively
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
that
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
sole
jurisdiction
is
for
--
its
relevant
here,
the
federal
reserve
board.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
is
to
pass
on
the
holding
company's
proposed
acquisition
of
shares
in
the
subsidiary
bank.
the
board,
your
honor,
cannot
in
any
case
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
bank
a
writ
or
come
to
the
--
come
to
grips
with
what
the
congress
has
prescribed
must
become
the
grips
with
under
section
27
of
the
national
bank
act
whether
the
proposed
bank
is
--
is
lawfully
entitled
to
commence
business
and
whether
the
bank
is
proposed
to
be
open
for
a
legitimate
object
contemplated
by
the
bank
act
and
we
say
in
this
case
that
this
was
an
illegitimate
object
from
the
very
beginning
to
whip
a
proposed
intentional
purposeful
evasion
of
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
sole
thing
here
involved
is
that
the
propo
--
that
this
comptroller
in
this
case
should
be
enjoined.
as
the
court
of
appeals
have
enjoined
him,
if
the
district
court
enjoined
him
from
licensing
a
bank
to
open
for
business.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
correct
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
was
just
trying
to
get
to
this
particular
part
of
this
case
because
it
shows
that
the
real
--
the
real
defendant
is
the
comptroller
and
the
real
defendant
from
the
very
beginning
has
been
the
comptroller
and
that's
what
i
wanted
to
try
to
get
to
now
in
these
facts
and
i
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
right
now.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
none.
none
be
--
before
the
comptroller
because
he
holds
no
hearing
whatsoever.
he's
entirely
ex
parte.
there
are
no
proceedings
before
the
comptroller
of
any
kind.
he
conducts
his
procedures
entirely
off
the
record
without
any
statutory
hearing
of
any
kind.
there's
no
place
for
anyone
who
wants
to
oppose,
to
oppose
until
you
can
go
to
court
to
get
an
injunction
when
he
proposes
to
do
the
charting.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
let's
just
examine
the
statutory
way
in
which
he
participates
before
the
board.
the
application
is
filed
mr.
justice
white.
the
federal
reserve
board
then
gives
the
comptroller
a
notice
that
the
application
has
been
filed.
the
comptroller
then,
if
he
disapproves,
the
board
must
hold
a
statutory
public
hearing
in
louisiana
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
where
the
bank
can
come
in
and
add
their
views
on
the
subject
but
in
this
case,
the
minute
the
comptroller
approves
that
obviates
the
necessity
for
any
public
hearing,
statutory
hearing
before
the
board.
so
what
the
board
did
in
this
case
they
didn't
hold
the
hearing
prescribed
by
the
statute,
they
didn't
have
a
trial
examiner
or
hearing
examiner
take
testimony
cross-examine,
hear
opponents
and
so
forth,
they
simply
held
a
meeting
up
here
in
washington
before
the
board
at
which
they
accepted
a
series
of
views
presented
by
the
bank
itself
and
by
the
minority
stockholders
of
the
bank
who
came
in
and
said,
“this
is
terrible,
don't
let
them
do
it”
and
then
by
one
other
bank
official
from
louisiana
who
apparently
got
notice
of
it
or
wind
of
it
and
came
up
here
and
participated.
but
frankly,
we
had
no
notice
and
there
was
no
statutory
public
hearing
held
in
louisiana
where
we
could
rush
in
and
make
a
lot
of
objections
and
cross-examine
witnesses
and
participate.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
if
the
hearing
that
the
--
the
informal
acceptance
of
views
as
what
they
called,
it
your
honor,
was
notice
that
was
given
in
the
federal
register
but
no
personal
notice
was
served
on
anyone
and
no
one
was
give
--
written
a
letter
by
the
board
saying,
“please
come,”
and
while
we
lawyers
here
in
washington
do
read
the
federal
register,
i
don't
know
how
many
people
actually
do
it
in
new
orleans
or
in
lafayette,
louisiana.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no
actual
notice
or
no
legal
notice
or
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
there
were
supposedly
articles
in
the
new
orleans
newspapers
about
it
your
honor.
whether
my
clients
knew
about
it
from
an
article
in
the
newspaper,
is
hardly
a
notice
that
i
should
refer
to
as
notice
bef
--
before
this
court.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it's
like
a
case
in
court
where
you
get
no
notice
that
a
complaint
has
been
filed
and
they
take
it
to
follow
a
judgment
against
you,
you
would
run
in
and
say
you
have
no
notice.
but
i'm
saying
that
it
wasn't
necessarily
surreptitious
but
the
fact
is
we
got
no
notice.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
mr.
webster,
who
is
the
general
counsel
for
the
bank
of
new
orleans
said
that
through
the
newspapers,
they
had
heard
that
these
proceedings
were
being
held
before
the
federal
reserve.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
there
was
a
note.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
would
say
before
the
board.
if
you
take
newspaper
notice
and
from
that
(voice
overlap)
before
federal
reserve
board,
if
they
would
come
up
here
before
the
board.
but
when
you
study
the
proceedings,
your
honor,
which
was
set
before
the
board
then
i
have
the
traditional
type
of
proceeding
that's
conducted
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
where
you
have
the
right
to
counsel
and
cross-examination
and
all
of
the
protection
which
you
otherwise
would
have.
they
accepted
a
series
of
unsworn
views
from
the
president
of
whitney-new
orleans,
a
series
of
views
from
one
of
the
dissenting
stockholders
of
whitney-new
orleans,
a
series
of
views
from
the
attorneys
or
some
of
the
other
minority
stockholders,
and
then
a
statement
by
one
other
official
of
another
national
bank
who
did
come
up
here
and
oppose
it.
but
this
is
not
the
type
of
statutory
hearing
which
of
course
the
congress
prescribed.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
i
would
say
that
the
--
the
record
is
absolutely
complete
and
i've
been
trying
to
get
to
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
it's
complete
with
the
admissions.
in
other
words,
it
was
candidly
admitted
in
the
federal
reserve,
mr.
justice
white
that
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
right.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
correct,
just
as
it
is.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
i
--
i
think
that
his
letter,
your
honor
fails,
it
even
mention
section
36
and
it
fails
to
mention
all
of
the
other
fault
at
law.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes
and
when
the
federal
reserve
board,
your
honor,
later
in
the
record
asked
the
comptroller
to
please
comment
on
the
claims
that
the
law
which
has
been
violated
and
circumvented,
he
wrote
back
in
a
subsequent
letter
and
refused
so
to
comment
or
failed
to
comment,
claiming
that
this
letter
which
your
honor
is
looking
at
now
merits,
page
166
which
expressed
the
views
of
the
comptroller.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
discharge
his
view.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
don't
think
your
honor
that
it's
a
matter
of
my
desire
but
how
i
think
about
it.
i
think
it's
a
pure
matter
of
law
that
they
have
no
authority
to
pass
on.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that
they
have
no
authority
to
pass
on
it.
but
this
is
a
matter
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
he's
the
official
choice
by
law
to
administer
the
national
bank
act
and
if
you
have
to
sue
the
comptroller
to
enjoin
the
comptroller
from
participating
in
a
plan
like
this
from
the
beginning
and
trying
to
put
the
thing
through
although
he
knows
its
wrong
and
although
he
knows
that
it's
in
violation
of
the
national
bank
act
and
i'm
trying
to
come
right
now
to
those
facts
in
this
case
which
i
say
show
that
he
knew
it
was
wrong
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
remedy
is
--
is
our
suit
here
for
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
our
remedy,
mr.
justice
black,
is
the
suit
here.
our
only
remedy
is
the
suit
here
because
once
he
issues
the
charter,
of
course,
he's
the
only
one
who
can
possibly
question
it
or
who
can
possibly
revoke
it,
so
the
only
chance
for
the
respondent
bank
based
with
this
unlawful
competition
is
to
sue
him
for
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
which
we've
done
here
and
which
the
district
court
has
upheld,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
upheld.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
i
don't
find
that
he
has
any
findings
because
your
honor,
he
makes
no
findings,
he
simply
says,
“i'm
going
to
is
--
issue
a
charter.”
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
if
the
board
has
to
do
it,
yes,
but
that's
because
they
do
make
a
decision
under
the
federal
bank
holding
company
act
that
this
charter,
pardon
me,
that
the
comptroller,
your
honor,
has
a
completely
ex
parte
proceeding
in
which
he
makes
no
record
and
in
which
he
renders
no
decision
other
than
that
he
suffice
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest
so-called
to
issue
a
charter
so
that
you
don't
get
the
question
of
the
comptroller
until
after
the
“cow
is
out
of
the
barn”
so
to
speak.
and
that's
what
we
were
trying
to
prevent
here,
the
--
because
even
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
positively.
because
in
this
case
now,
the
statute,
the
federal
reserve
board's
statute,
the
holding
company
act
gives
you
60
days
within
which
to
appeal
for
example
from
the
decisions
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
that
is
to
go
in
and
review
the
decision
of
the
federal
reserve
board
within
a
period
of
i
think
it
was
10
or
12,
15
days
after
the
federal
reserve
board
acted
and
before
the
60-day
appeal
period
had
even
substantially
started
to
run,
the
comptroller
here
issued
a
formal
announcement
saying,
“i'm
going
to
issue
the
charter
to
whitney-jefferson
whenever
they
apply
for
it.”
then
we
brought
our
suit
and
after
the
suit
was
filed
and
again
before
the
60-day
period
was
out,
he
came
in
with
an
affidavit
before
the
district
court
saying
that
if
--
“if
the
injunction
in
this
case,
the
temporary
restraining
order
is
lifted,
i
intend
immediately
to
charter
whitney-jefferson”
and
as
i
say,
your
honor,
once
he
charters
whitney-jefferson,
the
game
is
over
as
far
as
the
banks
are
concerned
because
no
one
can
question
that
other
than
the
comptroller
or
perhaps
the
attorney
general
who
in
this
case
were
quo
warranto
--
quo
warranto
proceeding
might
do
so.
but
that's
such
a
speculative
remedy
in
most
cases
than
no
remedy
here
because
the
attorney
general
has
actually
participated
in
representing
and
defending
the
comptroller
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
once
the
bank
is
over
--
is
open,
now
the
--
the
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act
has
been
completely
evaded,
has
been
completely
nullified
and
the
bank
is
open.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
we
have
done
that,
your
honor.
we
did
petition
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
the
federal
reserve
board
decision.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
the
one
that's
pending
and
the
court
there
has
held
its
decision
because
of
course
its
action
will
be
mooted,
if
this
court
upholds
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
--
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
we
could
have
applied
for
a
stay
in
the
fifth
circuit,
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
the
point
is
that
before
we
could
even
get
into
the
court
of
appeals
or
before
we
could
even
prepare
papers
and
get
into
the
court
of
appeals,
the
comptroller
here
issued
a
written
statement
or
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
stayed
the
acquisitions
but
as
he
had
showed
in
this
record
and
as
it
stated
that
we
--
our
suit
was
really
unfair.
they
had
already
gone
out
and
acquired
the
stock,
acquired
the
stock
and
the
federal
reserve
board
of
atlanta,
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
atlanta
had
gone
out
and
made
a
lease
on
a
temporary
building
that
you
see
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
they
had
gone
out
and
purchased
a
permanent
location
out
in
jefferson
highway
so
that
we
could
have
been
in
the
event
the
federal
reserve
--
pardon
me,
in
the
event
the
fifth
circuit
had
failed
to
grant
the
stay,
the
charter
would
have
been
granted
by
the
comptroller
before
the
issues
that
have
been
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
provision
said
the
act
had
been
--
had
been
printed
in
the
whitney
brief
on
page
71
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
he's
been
enjoined
from
issuing
a
certificate
of
authority
authorizing
whitney-jefferson
to
open
its
doors
for
business.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
your
honor
but
i
do
want
to
try
to
get
one
thing
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
find
no
error
in
that.
i
find
there's
danger
on
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it's
permanent
injunction.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
but
there's
no
error
in
which
your
honor
said
either
--
that
would
be
precisely
the
extent.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well
no,
he
couldn't
because
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
made
findings
and
conclusion
that
it's
unlawful.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
this
is
the
end
of
the
road
and
this
should
be
the
end
of
the
road
in
our
position
because
it
was
illegal
from
the
beginning.
you
see
once
whitney
decided
and
the
expressed
testimony
has
--
as
set
forth
at
page
14
and
15
of
our
brief
shows
that
whitney-new
orleans
set
out
on
this
whole
device
from
the
very
beginning
knowing
he
had
one
purpose
alone
in
mind
and
that
is
to
evade
and
circumvent
section
30
(c)
the
provisions.
if
this
is
allowed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
national
interest,
any
bank
in
any
state
whether
it'd
be
illinois
which
has
no
branch
banking
or
any
other
state,
any
big
national
bank
or
any
little
national
bank
that
wants
the
branch
now
will
simply
form
its
own
holding
company,
run
its
funds
through
and
open
the
branch
bank
where
it
wanted
to
originally.
this
is
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
your
honor,
it's
absolutely
correct.
i
did
overlook
the
fact
that
illinois
for
example
the
state
mention
does
have
the
bank
holding
company
act
which
is
to
supplement
the
branch
banking
in
order
to
prohibit
the
same
things
being
done
by
a
holding
company.
but
in
a
state,
that
doesn't
have
the
holding
company
act
and
only
has
the
branch
restrictions
well,
of
course
this
would
be
a
nice
way
to
simply
get
around
the
law.
change
itself
into
a
holding
company,
use
your
own
funds
and
open
the
bank
in
a
prohibited
location,
so
that's
the
national
interest
question
which
is
before
this
court
in
this
case.
it's
not
limited
to
our
case
or
the
state
of
louisiana
alone,
it
is
a
national
interest
question.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
question
here
is
even
more
narrower
than
that
because
of
course
whitney-jefferson
has
not
yet
become
a
national
bank
it's
simply
a
national
banking
association.
it
has
not
gotten
a
charter,
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
--
i
mean
of
this
case
that
they'd
be
enjoined
so
that
they
cannot
become
a
national
bank.
so
louisiana
confronted
with
a
head
on
rush
by
a
holding
company
to
get
into
business
and
it
was
the
only
known
holding
company
operation
to
even
be
organized
or
attempt
to
get
in
business
in
louisiana.
the
question
here
is
whether
louisiana
in
the
act
of
constitutional
exercise
of
its
police
power
can
go
one
step
further
and
say,
“before
we
let
this
lose”
the
beast,
i
think
it
was
called
by
mr.
spritzer,
“the
beast
lose
on
the
state,
can
we
pay
us
an
additional
provision
constitutionally
and
say
that
they
cannot
open
for
business
and
therefore
stamp
out
before
it
gets
started”
and
in
ferguson
against
skrupa
which
this
court
decided
just
recently,
kansas
faced
with
debt
adjusting
business
which
it
did
not
approve
of,
certainly
have
passed
a
law
which
outlawed
debt
adjusters,
existing
debt
adjusters,
and
present
debt
adjusters
are
contemplated
debt
adjusters,
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
kansas
found
that
that
was
in
line
with
its
public
policy
and
also
exercise
that
in
line
with
its
police
powers.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
your
honor
first
we,
let
me
give
you
the
reasons
in
order
as
i
understand
them.
number
one,
the
question
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
the
question
which
is
before
the
court
here
and
the
questions
before
this
court
really
i
don't
think
it
properly
be
before
the
court
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
there
is
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
mr.
chief
justice
because
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
could
say
quite
properly
that
the
question
you
raised
that
is
whether
this
is
an
illegal
branch
under
section
36
is
a
question
which
should
be
litigated
against
the
comptroller
who
operates
in
a
completely
different
procedure
under
a
different
statute
to
which
the
national
bank
act.
the
only
question
to
review
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
whether
the
decision
of
the
federal
reserve
board
on
the
right
of
whitney
holding
corporation
to
acquire
the
stock
in
the
two
proposed
banks
present
city
which
i'll
go
--
wanted
to
talk
about
in
a
moment
and
the
whitney-jefferson
bank
was
within
the
--
the
statutory
limits
of
their
law
to
which
the
federal
bank
holding
company
act.
you
see
we
have
before
the
fifth
circuit
only
the
holding
corporation
and
only
the
federal
reserve
board.
the
comptroller
is
not
a
party
and
therefore
he
would
be
less
free
to
do
anything
he
wanted
to
do
in
the
interim.
if
for
any
reason,
we
did
not
get
to
stay
which
would
prevent
the
comptroller
in
some
way
from
issuing
his
certificate,
the
game
would
be
over
before
the
fifth
circuit
case
could
even
be
adjudicated,
your
honor,
because
the
question
is
different,
the
parties
are
different
and
i
think
the
question
of
the
law
involved
is
different.
that
is
procedures
under
the
federal
bank
holding
company
act,
the
procedure
by
the
comptroller
under
the
national
bank
act.
so
i
don't
think
really
and
i
don't
want
to
--
in
the
light
of
the
situation,
say
that
there
would
be
no
question
and
no
matter
in
which
that
court
could
pass
on
these
questions
but
i
don't
think
and
i
know
the
government
has
been
urging
that
they
can't
pass
on
those
questions
because
in
the
proceedings
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
government,
the
same
attorneys
who
have
been
representing
the
comptroller
here,
had
told
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
board
must
pay
us
on
applications
for
the
acquisition
or
establishment
of
subsidiaries
without
regard
to
state
prohibitions
against
branch
banking,
and
that's
number
one.
then
they
sy
none
of
the
issues
before
this
court
had
been
decided
by
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
only
issue
resolved
by
that
court
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
that
was
the
government
is
telling
the
fifth
circuit.
so
i'm
sort
of
like
the
poor
country
fellow
who
was
caught
in
between
one
courts
told,
no
jurisdiction
because
all
this
ought
to
be
urged
against
the
comptroller
and
the
other
courts
told,
no
you
ought
to
go
to
the
--
this
court,
no
don't
come
to
the
comptroller,
go
talk
to
the
federal
reserve
board.
so
we're
in
a
position
where
we
have
no
remedy
if
we're
left
that
way.
i
mean
that's
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
in
the
middle
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
if
that's
the
verdict
sir
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
we'll
stop
him
to
but
he's
trying
to
get
that
further.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
and
i
said
they
weren't
because
if
they
hadn't
done
that,
we'd
be
in
the
fifth
circuit
with
a
case
that
may
or
may
not
involve
the
issue.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
because
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit
is
taking
this
position.
it
has
taken
this
position
over
a
period
of
almost
a
year
now
or
more
that
it
should
hold
its
case,
its
decision
in
the
case
until
the
final
decision
of
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
whichever
was
to
be
final
becomes
final
because
i
think
as
i
think
the
solicitor
general,
the
assistant
solicitor
general
as
he
admitted
this
morning
that
that
case
will
really
be
moot
if
this
case
is
upheld,
if
the
court
of
appeal
is
upheld.
now
just
as
should
not
be
a
thing
that
he
has
thought
of
a
game
with
chance.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
--
well
let
me
say
this
i
--
i
can
certainly
--
if
--
if
mr.
spritzer
didn't
say
that,
i
will
say
it
myself,
i
misunderstood
it
that
certainly
the
proceedings
in
the
fifth
circuit
will
be
moot
if
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case
that
has
upheld
either
one
and
quite
frankly,
if
the
--
if
the
thing
involved
is
wrong,
if
the
thing
involved
is
unfair,
if
the
thing
involved
is
illegal,
i
don't
think
we
should
be
put
in
the
position
of
shuttled
back
and
forth
between
courts
on
a
--
in
a
--
in
a
state
of
no
relief
whatsoever
because
if
you
dismiss
our
case
here,
then
we're
left
with
a
very,
very
dubious
situation,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
fifth
circuit.
and
if
this
plan
gets
into
operation
in
the
face
of
the
louisiana
statute,
in
the
face
of
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act,
louisiana's
public
policy
will
be
thwarted,
the
respondent
banks
have
the
unlawful
competition
unleashed
upon
them
in
jefferson
parish,
and
the
possibilities
for
the
other
states
in
the
united
states
are
just
a
big
question
of
low
because
then
any
other
bank
so
desiring
to
get
out
into
an
illegal
location
will
consider
the
possibility
as
put
here
that
well
worn
possibility
of
circumventing
the
laws
through
the
holding
company.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
there
are
two
issues
here
if
you
can
believe
the
government's
own
brief.
number
one,
whether
or
not
a
national
bank
knowing
that
it
is
prohibited
by
law,
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act
from
branching
to
a
prohibited
location
promoting
an
office
in
a
prohibited
location
can
with
the
company
and
with
the
help
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
who
considers
the
end
personally
desirable
to
him
simply
form
of
synthetic
holding
corporation
through
which
he
can
put
its
own
fund
and
often
at
the
illegal
prohibited
location
through
the
holding
company
device,
that's
number
one.
the
government
says
that
the
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
has
no
right
to
look
at
the
branching
restriction,
that
it
has
to
look
only
at
the
things
that
are
set
out
in
the
statute,
the
injury
to
competition,
the
public
interest
involved
all
those
things.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
whether
--
whether
it
wouldn't
be
the
very
good
question
because
there's
no
case
on
that
subject
and
congress
has
not
chosen
to
so
provide
but
the
--
certainly
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act
administered
exclusively
by
the
comptroller,
your
honors.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
no
jurisdiction
for
a
moment
over
section
36.
it
has
no
jurisdiction
at
all
on
the
national
bank
act
for
that
matter
and
i
think
the
first
person
who
would
be
complaining
bitterly
if
the
federal
reserve
board
tried
to
seek
an
administration
of
the
national
bank
act
would
be
comptroller
saxon
himself.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
louisiana
changed
its
law
right
after
the
case
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
right.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
a
proper
position
to
take
with
the
federal
reserve
board
regarding
the
stock
acquisition
phases
of
the
case.
but
i
think
it's
also
a
perfectly
good
legal
position
to
take
against
the
comptroller
who
is
charged
by
law
only
to
license
lawful
operations
and
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
good
position
to
take
here
and
i
think
with
--
i
think
the
court
below
was
absolutely
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
it
is
your
honor
because
the
district
court
based
its
original
injunction
on
the
louisiana
statute.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
we
have
two
positions
basically,
your
honor.
the
first
position
is
that
this
injunction
is
correct
and
the
injunction
issued
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
because
the
comptroller's
action
violates
section
36.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no
relevance
to
that,
no.
if
that
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
now,
the
louisiana
statute
simply
supplements
the
branching
provisions
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
it's
the
second
question
raised
by
this
case,
your
honor
which
is
that
it's
also
unlawful
for
the
comptroller
to
--
to
issue
a
certificate
licensing
the
opening
of
a
completely
directly
illegal
operation.
that's
what
the
district
court
rule
judgment
brought
in
and
then
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“well,
this
was
illegal
from
the
very
beginning,
you
should
not
have
even
started.”
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
there
is
a
challenge
here
to
that.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
they
say
it
denies
them
equal
protection
and
of
course
we
say
to
that,
that
it
does
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
cite
ferguson
against
skrupa
as
the
most
recent
decision.
we
say
this
law
was
enacted
within
the
police
powers
of
louisiana.
we
also
say
it
doesn't
deny
them
equal
protection
because
it
applies
to
all
holding
company,
to
all
bank
subsidiaries,
all
banks
equally.
the
fact
that
whitney
is
the
only
one
that
tried
to
get
into
the
holding
company
business
and
it's
thus
the
only
holding
company
as
its
fault
not
the
state.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
it
does
not
and
in
this
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
your
honor.
they
passed
this
act,
its
preamble
states
that
it's
against
the
public
policy
of
louisiana.
the
holding
company
operations
are
against
the
public
policy
and
they
passed
this
act
honestly
with
whitney
in
mind
because
whitney
was
rushing
madly
to
be
the
first
holding
company
in
louisiana
to
open
a
bank.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that's
correct
because
they
were
not
even
a
national
bank
at
that
point.
your
honor,
in
a
few
moments
which
are
remaining
to
me,
i
would
like
to
just
say
this
that
the
dispute
against
the
comptroller
saxon
in
this
case
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
starts
on
these
grounds.
number
one,
he
met
with
whitney-new
orleans
from
the
very
beginning
here
in
washington
before
they
even
put
the
plan
into
operation
and
sat
down
with
them
and
advised
and
consented
with
them
on
--
on
how
they
could
really
get
a
bank
open
in
jefferson
parish.
number
two,
the
first
step
in
this
whole
plan
was
to
take
$350,000
of
money
out
of
whitney-new
orleans
to
buy
stock
in
the
whitney
holding
corporation.
section
24
of
the
national
bank
act
makes
it
illegal
for
a
national
bank
to
use
its
funds
to
purchase
stock
of
any
corporation.
the
comptroller
approved
it
knowing
well
that
that
was
an
illegal
step.
the
second
step
of
this
complicated
transaction
involved
the
formation
of
what
the
federal
reserve
board
called
a
phantom
bank
crescent
city
national
bank
of
new
orleans.
the
purpose
of
that
bank
was
one
thing
only,
to
eliminate
all
dissenting
stockholders
under
section
215
of
the
national
bank
act
because
under
that
section
if
a
dissenting
stockholder
doesn't
go
along
with
the
merger
of
that
phantom
bank
with
the
bank
of
new
orleans,
his
stock
can
be
appraised
and
he
can
be
bought
out.
this
was
step
number
two
looking
toward
a
complete
unitary
type
of
operation.
step
number
three
was
to
take
$650,000
out
of
the
bank
of
new
orleans
and
run
it
through
the
holding
company.
all
of
those
sections
1845
of
title
xii
a
provision
of
the
federal
bank
holding
company
act
say
that
a
bank
shall
not
invest
its
funds
in
any
of
the
securities
of
a
holding
company,
shall
not
lend
any
money
to
a
holding
company,
shall
not
engage
in
upstream
finances.
so
here's
number
three,
the
steps
of
the
comptroller
has
approved.
finally,
we
get
down
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
he's
going
to
charter
this
thing
in
jefferson
parish
in
violation
of
section
36.
so
i
complained
here,
he
goes
before
the
federal
reserve
board
under
section
1842
of
title
xii,
gives
his
approval
to
this
whole
plan
and
therefore
obviates
the
public
hearing
on
it
in
louisiana,
the
statutory
hearing
where
there
could
be
crossed
examination
and
so
forth.
so
we're
litigating
against
the
right
end
in
the
right
court.
the
suit
against
the
federal
reserve
board
when
they
--
when
they
went
to
the
comptroller
during
the
course
of
their
proceedings
and
said
look,
the
minority
stockholders
of
whitney-jefferson
who
will
be
squeezed
out
on
this
thing,
what's
your
advise
as
to
why
this
might
be
in
circumvention
of
the
national
bank
act
which
you
administer?
he
refused
to
comment
on
it.
so
we
find
and
felt
here,
your
honor
--
feeling
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
eminently
correct
and
perfectly
correct
in
every
respect
and
we
feel
also
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
upholding
the
louisiana
act.
but
on
either
ground
we
think
we're
entitled
to
judgment
of
an
--
of
an
affirmance.
