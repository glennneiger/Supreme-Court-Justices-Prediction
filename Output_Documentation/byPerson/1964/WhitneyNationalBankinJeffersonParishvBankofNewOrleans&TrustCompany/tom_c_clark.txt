could
i
--
may
i
ask
you,
are
you
going
into
the
respective
jurisdictions
of
the
comptroller
and
the
federal
reserve
board?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
--
were
the
comptroller's
has
an
independent
function
to
perform
or
is
it
ministerial
and
so
on?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
it
says
that
this
additionally
relate
largely
to
an
alleged
violation
of
provisions
of
national
bank
act?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
i
suppose
that
with
this
kind
of
problem,
we
have
here
arises
because
the
--
the
holding
company
is
the
applicant
before
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
new
subsidiary
affiliate
in
seeking
the
charter
is
the
applicants
before
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
it
can't
be
because
it's
not
in
existence?
justice
tom
c.

that
is
right
it
is.
justice
tom
c.
clark
prior
to
the
passage
of
the

they
said
that
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
board.
than
what
largely
under
(inaudible).
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
the
issue
here?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
may
be
issued
before
anybody
even
get
at
something.
justice
tom
c.
clark
sometimes
i
remember
when
i
was
in
the
government,
they
acted
predictably
and
i
mean,
is
that
it,
asserting
perhaps
you
might
get
an
injunction,
so
is
there
any
merit
for
that,
i
suppose
it
would
be
best
to
prohibit
for
it
to
have
stay.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
there
any
merit
from
the
proposition
that
should
be
a
stay,
well
perhaps
this
court
should
take
to
some
action.
justice

mr.
spritzer
you
could
say
you
need
some
homework,
what
was
the
date
of
the
louisiana
section
5
in
reference
with
reference
to
the
amended
or
what
we
call
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
board?
