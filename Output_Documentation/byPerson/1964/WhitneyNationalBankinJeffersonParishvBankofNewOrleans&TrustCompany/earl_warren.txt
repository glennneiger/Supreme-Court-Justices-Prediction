that
was
before
the
passage
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
board
have
any
function
with
relations
to
administrative
function
with
relation
to
branch
banking?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
is
the
scope
of
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
a
specific
section
on
that,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
senate
version
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
within
section
7,
leave
with
the
states
the

to
control.
chief

earl
warren
this
kind
banking
(voice

if
they
are
state
banks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
your
position
that
that
applies
only
to
state
banks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
acheson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
merrigan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
merrigan
does
the
size
of
the
bank
--
is
the
size
of
the
bank
relative
to
the
--
to
the
legal
question
that's
involved
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
--
wouldn't
your
position
be
the
same,
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
this
was
a
small
bank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
to
arrive
in
order
to
--
this
is
in
fact
was
in
effect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
sort
of
evade
the
question
when
--
when
you
say
that
if
a
bank
starts
out
to
evade
the
law
because
when
the
government
gives
them
a
choice
of
having
either
branch
bank
or
an
affiliated
bank
or
a
holding
company
bank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
that
--
that's
what
i
say,
aren't
you
evading
the
question
when
you
say
evading?
you
have
to
establish
that
to
us
that
--
that
it
is
evasion
rather
than
--
rather
than
an
attempt
to
--
to
come
under
one
of
the
regulatory
procedures
of
the
federal
government,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
essential
difference
between
this
bank
and
chain
bank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that's
an
affiliated
bank
i'm
talking
about
a
branch
bank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
any
significant
distinction
with
creating
this
bank
and
a
branch
bank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
understood
counsel
for
the
government
to
say
that
--
that
each
of
these
banks
must
stand
on
its
own
financial
structure
and
they
were
limited
and
they're
borrowing
and
they're
lending
by
their
--
by
their
assets
and
liabilities
and
that
includes
the
branch
of
a
branched
bank,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
public
notice
given
by
the
board?
was
it
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
--
why
couldn't
you
go
into
the
court
of
appeals
and
have
this
decision
of
the
board
reviewed?
why
didn't
you
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
one
that's
pending?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
this
in
the
record,
the
section
stating
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
review?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
merrigan,
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
this,
why
couldn't
you
on
the
direct
review
before
the
court
of
appeals
have
obtained
adequate
relief
under
this
language.
upon
the
filing
of
such
petition
the
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
affirm,
set
aside
or
modify
the
order
of
the
board
and
to
require
the
board
to
take
such
action
with
regard
to
the
matter
under
review
as
the
court
deems
proper.
the
findings
of
the
board
as
to
the
facts
have
supported
by
substantial
evidence
so
be
conclusive.
now,
why
couldn't
you
have
gotten
all
the
relief
you're
entitled
to
and
why
couldn't
you
have
asked
for
it
in
that
proceeding
rather
than
to
come
here
collaterally
where
this
order
could
never
be
reviewed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that's
--
that's
the
danger
of
it,
isn't
it,
that
it
is
a
direct
review
of
the
order
that
--
that
you're
complaining
against
and
--
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
you
could
have
had
that
reviewed
thoroughly
and
according
to
that
broad
language,
couldn't
you
have
obtained
any
relief
to
which
you
were
entitled?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
issue
is
there
in
this
case
that
is
not
in
the
fifth
circuit
case?

justice
