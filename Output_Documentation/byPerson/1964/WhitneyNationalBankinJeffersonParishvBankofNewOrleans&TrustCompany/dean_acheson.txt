mr.
dean
acheson
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
louisiana
statute
which
has
been
put
forward
in
this
case
as
an
alternative
ground
for
granting
the
injunction,
a
ground
that's
not
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
accepted
by
the
district
court.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
statute
itself.
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
it's
a
statute
which
reads
on
actions
by
citizens
of
louisiana.
it
has
a
section
which
makes
five
acts
illegal
and
punishable
by
fines
and
or
imprisonment.
this
section
reads,
“it
shall
be
unlawful”
and
then
follow
four
provisions
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case
and
not
applicable.
and
finally
there
is
a
fifth
section.
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
bank
holding
company
or
subsidiary
thereof
to
open
for
business
any
bank
not
now
open
for
business
whether
or
not
a
charter,
permit,
license
or
certificate
to
open
for
business
has
already
been
issued
and
this
section
is
specifically
made
applicable
to
a
national
bank
and
in
this
case
is
sought
to
be
made
applicable
to
one.
it
is
not
in
dispute
between
the
parties
in
this
litigation
that
without
some
permission
from
congress,
this
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
it
is
argued
that
congress
has
given
that
permission
in
section
7
of
the
national
bank
holding
company
act
which
has
just
been
referred
to
by
the
chief
justice.
before
attending
to
that
section,
i
should
like
to
make
one
exclusionary
point.
it
has
been
argued
in
the
brief
that
other
states
have
the
same
or
similar
statutes
to
that
of
louisiana
and
that
these
statutes
have
been
upheld.
this
is
in
error.
the
bank
examiner
of
louisiana
in
his
brief
candidly
admits
that
he
says,
“respondent
will
concede
that
there
is
no
other
state
bank
holding
company
act
which
has
the
exact
language
contained
in
section
1035
of
the
louisiana
act.”
he
could
have
gone
further
and
conceded
that
there's
no
other
state
act
which
has
any
provision
remotely
similar
to
subsection
5
of
the
act
and
indeed
that
no
state
act
undertakes
to
enforce
its
restrictions
against
bank
holding
companies
by
operating
upon
the
opening
or
closing
of
a
national
bank
so
that
the
authorities
sought
to
be
derived
from
other
statutes
and
other
decisions
is
not
correct.
mr.
dean
acheson
there
are
--
mr.
dean
acheson
now,
mr.
justice
there
are
states
which
have
the
exact
four
provisions
of
the
louisiana
statute
and
then
stopped
and
this
is
almost
the
identical
legislation
that
occurs
in
other
states.
they
are
the
same
as
louisiana
except
they
do
not
contain
section
5
which
solely
is
invoked
here.
now,
it
is
argued
as
i
said
that
section
7
permits
the
louisiana
act
as
in
section
sub
5.
section
7
reads
as
follows
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes.
section
5
is
imprinted
here
in
our
--
mr.
dean
acheson
you
have
it.
section
7
reads
as
follows,
this
is
section
7
of
the
national
bank
holding
company
act.
the
enactment
by
congress
in
this
chapter
shall
not
be
construed
as
preventing
any
state
from
exercising
such
powers
and
jurisdiction
which
it
now
has
or
may
hereafter
have
with
respect
to
banks,
bank
holding
companies
and
subsidiaries
thereof.
in
order
to
make
it
very
clear
what
the
congress
meant
by
this
section,
the
senate
committee
have
the
following
in
its
report
to
the
senate.
it
said,
a
great
deal
of
concern
has
been
expressed
that
section
7
of
this
bill
granted
new
authority
and
powers
to
states
over
national
banks
in
general
and
respecting
the
stocks
of
national
banks
in
particular.
in
order
to
clarify
the
legislative
history
of
section
7,
the
committee
wishes
to
emphasize
that
this
section
does
not
grant
any
new
authority
to
states
over
national
banks.
the
purpose
of
this
action
is
to
preserve
to
the
states
those
powers
which
they
now
have
in
our
dual
banking
system.
it
is
always
of
upper
most
importance
a
legislation
of
this
nature
to
preserve
the
dual
system
of
national
and
state
banks
and
section
7
must
be
viewed
in
that
light.
thus,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
clear
from
this
statement
that
section
7
neither
increased
nor
reduced
the
preexisting
state
powers.
it
expressed
the
congressional
intention
not
to
extend
federal
preemption
into
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
bank
holding
companies.
it
did
not
narrow
the
field
of
preemption
in
regard
to
national
banks.
it
kept
open
for
state
legislation
the
field
in
which
the
statute
operated,
that
is
the
field
of
bank
holding
companies.
it
did
not
open
to
state
legislation
the
field
which
the
national
bank
act
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
had
closed.
this
is
a
matter
of
most
important
legislative
practice
and
it's
an
area
which
we
would
be
brought
in
the
greatest
confusion
if
the
views
of
the
respondents
were
adopted.
well,
for
instance,
let
me
point
out
how
this
confusion
occurs
in
the
mind
of
the
counsel
for
louisiana,
the
state
bank
examiner.
in
his
brief
he
writes
this,
“if
the
congress
has
preserved
to
the
states
the
right
to
prohibit
and
restrict
the
expansion
of
bank
holding
companies,”
and
it
has
this
is
clearly
the
purpose
of
section
7
to
keep
open
to
the
states
the
right
to
prohibit
and
res
--
restrict
the
expansion
of
bank
holding
companies
and
he
goes
on,
“there
is
no
difference
between
provisions
which
seek
to
restrict
bank
holding
companies
by
one,
prohibiting
the
acquisition
of
stock
in
a
national
bank
or
two,
by
prohibiting
a
subsidiary
of
a
bank
holding
company
not
already
open
for
business
from
opening
for
business.”
now,
what
is
asserted
here
as
contending
no
difference
is
the
very
issue
at
stake
in
this
case
and
the
difference
is
as
plain,
as
plain
can
be.
provision
one
prevents
a
holding
company
from
acquiring
bank
stock
whether
it
is
national
bank
stock
or
other
banks
stock.
provision
two,
however,
prevents
an
approved
national
bank
from
opening
its
doors.
the
incidence
of
provision
one
falls
on
bank
holding
companies
which
are
open
for
state
regulations.
the
incidence
of
provision
two
falls
on
national
banks
which
are
closed
to
state
regulation.
congress
wished
to
leave
one
free
and
to
leave
the
other
closed.
mr.
dean
acheson
that's
the
--
they
--
they're
not
involved
here
at
all.
if
the
louisiana
statute
stopped
the
section
4,
subsection
4,
it
would
not
be
invoked
in
this
case
at
all.
it
wouldn't
be
relevant.
none
of
its
provisions
would
be
applicable.
it
is
only
when
the
statute
attempts
to
keep
close
the
bank
which
the
federal
government
is
trying
to
open
that
it
is
involved
here
and
it
is
unconstitutional.
the
system
which
is
created
by
the
holding
company
legislation
and
the
national
bank
legislation
is
very
clear
and
very
worthy.
it
is
provided
in
the
national
bank
holding
company
act
that
states
are
protected
against
the
invasion
of
foreign
holding
companies.
the
federal
reserve
board
is
prohibited
from
permitting
any
holding
company
to
buy
the
stock
of
any
bank
in
the
state
which
does
not
want
that
to
occur.
in
fact,
it
says,
it
may
permit
the
purchase
of
bank
stock
by
a
foreign
holding
company
only
in
banks
and
estate
which
expressly
by
legislation
permits
this
to
happen.
then
it
leaves
open
through
the
state
the
power
to
prohibit
holding
companies
altogether
and
to
restrict
the
expansion
of
those
which
already
exists.
there
is
a
perfect
balance
and
scheme
in
this
legislation
which
is
entirely
were.
now,
if
it
is
that
that
scheme
is
invaded
by
the
provision
sought
to
be
exactly
held
here
we
immediately
get
into
most
dangerous
situations.
there
is
a
con
--
confrontation
directly
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
let
us
presume
that
this
state
had
sought
to
be,
this
statute
had
sought
to
be
invoked
according
to
its
terms.
you
see
it
doesn't
read
now
at
all
upon
the
comptroller.
the
comptroller
is
only
enjoined
here,
i
suppose,
by
some
theory
that
if
he
issues
this
certificate
he
will
contribute
to
the
delinquency
of
a
citizen
of
louisiana.
this
is
a
criminal
statute
which
says
citizens
of
louisiana
may
not
form
holding
companies,
may
not
open
banks
including
national
banks.
presume
then
that
the
comptroller
had
issued
this
certificate
without
interference
and
that
the
state
had
then
sought
to
indict
and
toput
into
penitentiary
the
men
who
were
authorized
by
the
comptroller
to
open
the
national
bank.
there
you
would
have
a
direct
confrontation
between
the
power
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
authority
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
stemming
from
the
cook
county
case
in
1882,
the
very
last
session
of
this
court
has
been
clear
that
the
national
banking
act
creates
a
complete
system
for
the
establishment,
formation
and
operation
of
national
banks
in
which
no
state
may
interfere
in
anyway
whatever.
