justice

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
federal
reserve
board
agrees
with
you
in
this
regard.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
nothing
in
the
reserve
board's
--
in
the
proceedings
of
federal
reserve
board
in
this
case
which
indicates
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
spritzer
then
the
--
i
--
i
take
it,
the
branch
banking
restriction
is
administered
by
the
comptroller?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
holding
company
act
by
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
suggestion
is
that
the
congress
in
dealing
with
the
bank
holding
companies
deliberately
that
that
is
a
decision
by
congress
to
proscribe
the
treatment
of
--
of
holding
company
subsidiaries
as
branches.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
that
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
is
this
solely
supposed
to
be
in
section
5.
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
wouldn't
they
--
when
would
a
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
when
would
a
subsidiary
of
a
bank
holding
company
be
considered
a
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
any
time
that
happens,
the
subs
--
the
other
subsidiaries
the
holding
company
is
a
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
even
in
those
states
which
permit
bank
holding
companies
but
prevent
branches,
this
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
prevent
as
a
federal
rule
the
bank
holding
company
because
the
federal
rule
would
be,
this
is
a
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
state
law
had
approved
the
creation
of
the
holding
company,
the
federal
law
would
say,
“no
it's
a
branch?”
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
state
law
had
applied
--
had
approved
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
that
basis
any
--
any
two
friendly
banks
might
be
--
there
are
correspondent
banks
between
cities
who
do
this
all
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
--
does
the
new
bank
still
has
its
own
obligation
to
some
depositors
subject
to
its
own
liabilities,
subject
to
independent
examination
by
the
comptroller,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bank
might
fail
--
that
bank
might
fail
without
affecting
the
older
banks
at
all
or
--
or
the
reverse.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
new
bank
might
fail
without
--
without
affecting
other
banks
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
would
be
true
of
the
branch
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
that
--
why
wouldn't
these
matters
be
appropriate
for
the
board
who
considered
in
granting
this?
why
wouldn't
you
address
this
argument
that
this
is
in
effect
a
branch
to
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
--
i
saw
that
in
your
brief.
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
in
a
letter?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
is
that,
that
168
of
--
of
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
turned
you
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
unders
--
i
take
it
is
an
order
subject
to
inquiry
to
whether
when
the
comptroller
has
jurisdiction
over
the
branch
banking
law
and
the
board
has
jurisdiction
of
the
holding
company
and
under
the
holding
company
act
and
the
allegation
was
made
that
the
holding
company
is
going
to
violate
the
branch
banking
law.
there
is
a
question
as
to
what
and
in
what
form
do
you
wear
that
kind
of
an
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
is
a
--
he
is
a
party
to
the
proceedings
before
the
board
and
if
you
are
airing
arguments
about
this
being
a
violation
of
the
branch
banking
law
the
comptroller
is
well
aware
of
it
and
that
he
participated
in
the
argument
and
he
did
participate
in
the
matter
and
--
and
recommended
the
board
with
the
--
an
application
to
be
approved,
did
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
that
there's
--
that
the
record
is
inadequate
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
really
a
branch
now,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
that
they're
not
being
in
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
record
is
complete.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
merrigan
let's
assume
that
the
rule
was,
the
correct
rule
was
that
the
federal
reserve
board
should
consider
this
kind
of
an
argument
and
dispose
of
it.
if
that
were
the
correct
rule,
then
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
one
that
ought
to
tell
the
board
to
--
to
omit
it.
you
omitted
consideration
of
the
crucial
element
in
deter
--
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
approve
this
subsidiary
of
the
holding
company.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
should
or
would
--
should
pass
on
this
question.
if
that
were
the
rule,
if
that
were
the
rule
you're
saying
that
not
only
that
they
didn't
pass
on
it
and
that
they
said
that
the
comptroller
should
consider
it
but
you're
saying
that
that's
the
way
that
rule
should
be
and
that
the
comptroller
should
be
the
one
to
pass
on
this
kind
of
a
claim
rather
than
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you
100%.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
have
the
case
of
--
in
fact
that
charter
today
is
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
bank
holding
company
can
own
that
bank
it's
still
unresolved.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
the
--
that's
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
merrigan
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
however.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
not
only,
they
don't
do
it
for
this
charter
pending
appeal
of
the
fifth
circuit
don't
ever
issue
it
because
this
is
a
branch.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
merrigan,
in
--
in
the
fifth
circuit
since
the
board
--
between
the
time
the
board
acted
in
the
case
at
the
fifth
circuit,
louisiana
changed
this
law,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
is
public
policy,
right
after
the
board
acted.
and
lets
assume
that
it
hasn't
even
added
section
5
on
to
the
act
then
there
would
have
been
a
flat
provision
in
louisiana
against
the
acquisition
of
this
bank,
isn't
that
true,
under
the
new
law?
if
that
law
had
been
in
existence
prior
to
the
board's
action
of
course,
the
--
the
approval
would
have,
that
could
have
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
would
a
proper
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
you'd
be
that
--
that
these
case
isn't
final,
it
isn't
over,
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
louisiana
law
that
the
--
that
now
the
board
should
consider?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
your
position
that
as
regards
to
comptroller
license,
it
isn't
there
--
i
mean
louisiana
statute
is
not
relevant
to
your
position
as
against
the
comptroller,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
but
if
the
--
if
the
louisiana
law
prevented
the
old
bank
requiring
the
new
one
and
it
didn't,
there
wouldn't
be
a
branch
even
if
there
was
a
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
spritzer,
if
section
7
authorizes
a
statute
including
this
section
5
provision,
can
the
board
in
any
event
approve
this
acquisition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
ruling
of
the
board?
