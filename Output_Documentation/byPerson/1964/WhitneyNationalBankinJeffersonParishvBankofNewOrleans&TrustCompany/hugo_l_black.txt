justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
issue
was
attacked
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
if
--
if
it
is
really
in
genuine
a
device
perfectly
created
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
branch
banking
act
and
that
people
who
were
being
proved
by
evidence
that
the
courts
cannot
look
through
the
sham
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
quite
make
my
question
clear
or
maybe
it's
not
clear
to
me.
let
us
assume
that
this
is
not
a
genuine
holding
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
holding
company
bank
act.
but
it
is
a
genuine
branch
bank
efforts
--
branch
bank
labeled
with
the
name
holding
company,
is
it
your
idea
that
the
courts
couldn't
pass
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
fact
but
whatever
the
federal
board
says.
suppose
that
he
had
said
that
the
dog
is
a
cat.
i'm
talking
about
that
kind.
what
you
have
here
is
an
argument
as
i
understand
it.
i
don't
know
what's
right
or
what's
wrong
but
that
this
is
not
the
real,
genuine
holding
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
law
but
is
in
reality
a
branch,
branch
bank
disguised
under
the
label
of
the
holding
--
holding
company
there.
who
has
the
right
to
determine
that?
do
you
say
that
the
courts
can't
determine
that
and
that
has
to
be
determined
by
the
federal
reserve
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
then
and
i
think
i
understand
you,
you
would
say
that
even
if
you
say
this
had
all
the
incidents
of
a
holding
company.
suppose
it
could
be
held
it
had
all
the
incidents
of
a
branch
bank
disguised
as
a
holding
company,
would
you
still
stay
that
that
matter
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
federal
reserve
board
to
be
considered
on
review?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
suppose
it
had
every
incident
on
earth
of
a
branch
bank
except
they
call
it
a
holding
company.
do
i
--
is
it
the
government's
view
as
i
understood
it
was
that
that
has
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
courts
can't
decide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
would
be
reviewable
in
the
fifth
circuit
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
(inaudible)
however
that
congress
(inaudible)
that
congress
didn't
have
to
deem
to
preempt
(inaudible)
with
the
national
bank
and
holding
company.
that
of
course
(inaudible),
isn't
that
correct?
i
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
then
that
the
federal
reserve
should've
taken
into
account
for
its
business
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
treasury
department,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
did,
what's
your
remedy
and
he
just
did
it
deliberately.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
his
findings
that
--
that
it
did
not
violate
those
national
or
it's
not
a
branch
bank
that's
unduly
prohibiting,
you'll
read
that
his
findings
are
final
or
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
board
has
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
--
assuming
that
the
--
the
board
does
have
the
power
to
do
what
it's
trained
to
do
there,
foreclose
you
and
it's
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
are
you
claiming
here
that
unless
you
get
a
relief
against
the
comptroller
at
this
time,
you
will
be
irreparably
invincible
that
the
view
of
the
board's
action
can
be
taken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
trying
to
ask
you
this
question
because
i'm
much
interested
in
what
was
actually
being
done
than
what's
held
out.
in
this
order
what
has
been
held
up?
what
has
the
comptroller
been
ordered
not
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
of
course,
if
the
court
of
appeals
holds
on
indeed
that
the
board,
reserve
board
was
wrong,
there
would
be
no
harm
done
here
would
it
unless
it's
harm
to
the
comptroller
to
keep
him
from
doing
his
--
his
pending
time.
there
would
have
been
no
harm
subject
except
that
the
bank
would
have
been
open
and
it
would
have
been
held
by
the
review
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
it
never
should
have
been
open.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
why
does
it
not
--
why
is
it
--
it
is
an
error
for
the
court
here
to
enjoin
the
opening
of
a
bank
while
there
is
pending
in
the
court
of
the
fifth
circuit
a
motion
for
review
and
it
has
not
been
decided
which
if
decided
in
your
favor
would
have
made
any
issuance
of
power
to
operate
the
bank
on
local.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
in
the
position
that
the
lawyer
frequently
gets
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
playing
nice,
playing
fair,
that
something
maybe
done
by
three
or
four
people
has,
that
one
of
them
will
knock
him
out
and
he
doesn't
know
which
one
the
court
finally
going
to
hold
his
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
have
two
case
pending,
one
to
review
the
action
of
the
board
which
undoubtedly
the
statute
proviso.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
have
one
on
the
ground
that
the
comptroller
was
pertinent
to
issue
a
charter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
that
way
the
charter
would
be
out
and
you're
after
him
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
the
court
below
were
wrong
in
permanently
deciding
this
as
it
did.
you
still
insisted
it
was
not
but
assuming
that
it
was
wrong
and
permanently
decided
was
it
wrong
in
issuing
an
injunction
to
prevent
you,
to
prevent
the
comptroller
from
completing
this
as
you
would
call
it
coup
d'Ã©tat
before
you
could
finally
get
it
litigated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
after
this
argument
you
may
take
it
wise
probably,
put
could
under
the
fifth
circuit
and
see
what's
in
there,
what
else
happens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
do
is
to
stop
the
charter
being
issued
and
the
bank
operating
until
you
can
get
your
question
finally
litigated
whether
it's
legal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
determined
the
judgment
law
and
granted
it
unconstitutional
because
it
is
passed
after
the
bank
attempted
to
--
cared
to
expand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
contributes
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
to
indicate
in
anyway
that
the
state's
permission
to
outlaw
this
--
this
kind
of
procedure
depends
on
one,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
basis
of
the
holding
company
act?
was
it
on
the
basis
that
the
holding
companies
on
matters,
kinds
of
operations
should
be
furthered
in
the
public
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
contention
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
not
have
the
charter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
isn't
that
about
the
statute?
i
suppose
that
he
may,
the
comptroller
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
why
does
the
case
at
bar
that
certain
end
whether
this
act
was
passed
on
louisiana,
it
was
admitted
to
express
its
hostility
questionable
to
the
attorney
of
the
state,
this
holding
of
one
of
his
counsel
(inaudible).
why
would
did
it
bar
them
to
take
whether
that
is
constitutional
or
because
it
--
it
has
forbidden
it
--
has
been
expressed
to
pass
the
law
which
the
congress
has
said
unfair,
unless
for
some
reason
about
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
the
comptroller
be
the
proper
person
if
he's
in
doubt
that
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
waiting
like
both
of
them
will
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
reach
the
conclusion
that
he
was
right
and
enjoined
but
he
gave,
the
court
gave
their
own
reasons
(voice
overlap)
there
was
an
act
of
louisiana
because
they
have
the
right
to
pay
decided
under
section
7.
do
you
mean
that
the
event
we
should
say
that
the
total
that
i'm
talking
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
understand,
they
now
had
moved
that
it
seems
to
me
that
therefore
they
can
have
a
thought
of
amending
it.
that
is
that
even
though
section
7
fully
authorizes
the
defendant
to
withdraw
that
the
law
is
fully
apt
that
you
can't
stop
the
comptroller
from
giving
the
license
to
other
banks.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
is
section
7
does
authorize
it,
and
the
act
doesn't.
