justice
arthur
j.

now
assuming
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
is
it
called?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
statute
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

the
holding
and
not
the
national.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
does
the
holding
company
headed
by
the
provision
of
national
bank.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
you
still
have
the
authority
to
make
the
final
judgment
that
was
in
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
according
to
that
â€“
to
that
state
--
there
are
that
we
have
regarded
i
suppose.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
it
your
view
that
it
should
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
if
you're
--
this
and
i
think
that
was
left
and
that
the
federal
reserve
is
going
to
say
in
fact
the
violation
that
this
bank
is
in
whether
or
not
is
in
effect
the
claims
that
they
can
conclude
and
that
was
all.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
discharge
his
view.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
really
what
you're
saying
that
the
only
time
that
the
stipulation
was
given
is
the
substantive
part
of
your
argument
that
this
very
well,
if
we
are
to
say,
this
fact
that
(inaudible)
constituted
a
violation
of
the
section
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
think
that
the
fed
--
did
you
not
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
federal
reserve
board
happens
to
be
reserved
and
find
that
it
has
been
reviewed
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
as
you
conceded
though,
the
authorization
has
happened
and
the
fact
that
the
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
have
had
proof
for
section
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
again
there
is
the
charter
in
which
the
new
bank
holds
it
on.
they
can
have
shortcut
the
statute
and
long
after
the
court
has
stated
that
this
court
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
actually
that
before
you
answer
the
question.
wouldn't
there
(inaudible).
but
the
question
really
here
is
that
louisiana
is
not
having
been
assigned
that
all
this
could
close.
that
they
just
have
to
go
see
with
respect
to
the
banks
which
in
short
has
the
bank
holding
which
it
can

isn't
that
the
question?

temporary
restraining
order.
