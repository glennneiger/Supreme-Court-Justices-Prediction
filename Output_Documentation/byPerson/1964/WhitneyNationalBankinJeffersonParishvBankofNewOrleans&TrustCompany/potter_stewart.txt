at

without
the
knowledge
of
your
client.

afraid
we
didn't
say
that
it
was
surreptitious.

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,

kind
of
notice
--
justice

was
there
not
an
opportunity
for
your
clients
to
come
here
and
be
heard,
if
they
have
object
--
objections
before
the

now
not
before

the
state
and
the
federal

wouldn't
it?
