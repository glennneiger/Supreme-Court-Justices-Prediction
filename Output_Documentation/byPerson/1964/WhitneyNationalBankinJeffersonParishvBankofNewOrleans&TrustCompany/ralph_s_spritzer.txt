mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case
comes
here
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
the
petitions
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
of
the
whitney
national
bank
of
jefferson
parish.
at
the
suit
of
the
three
respondent
banks
all
of
them
state
banks
alleging
standing
on
the
basis
of
competitive
injury
and
at
the
suit
of
the
louisiana
banking
commissioner,
the
courts
below
have
permanently
enjoined
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
from
issuing
a
so-called
certificate
of
authority
which
is
the
last
document
of
title
that
a
national
bank
association
requires,
requires
in
order
to
open
its
doors
and
commence
doing
business
as
a
national
bank.
the
district
court
granted
its
injunction
solely
on
the
ground
that
a
louisiana
statute
was
effective
to
forbid
the
opening
of
the
national
bank.
that
statute
was
passed
as
emergency
legislation
while
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
pending
in
the
district
court.
the
louisiana
act
purports
to
forbid
any
bank
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
a
holding
company
and
whitney-jefferson
is
that.
from
opening
for
business
in
louisiana
it
--
it
has
not
yet
done
so.
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
same
conclusion
namely
that
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
comptroller
should
issue
but
it
reached
that
result
by
a
quite
different
route.
it
concluded
that
the
opening
of
whitney-jefferson
would
be
a
violation
of
federal
law
relating
to
the
establishment
of
a
branch
or
branch
office
of
a
bank.
the
court
of
appeals
was
aware
that
the
federal
reserve
board
which
administers
the
bank
holding
company
act
had
approved
after
full
administrative
proceedings
the
relationship
between
whitney-jefferson
and
its
parent
the
whitney
holding
company.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that
the
federal
reserve
board's
order
which
incidentally
has
been
appealed
by
two
of
these
same
respondents
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
a
case
which
has
been
argued
by
--
before
that
court.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that
the
board's
order
was
invalid
nor
did
it
rule
upon
the
question
whether
louisiana's
statute
relating
to
subsidiaries
of
bank
holding
companies
could
validly
forbid
the
opening
of
this
contemplated
national
bank.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
it
were
to
succeed,
i
would
assume
that
the
board's
order
would
either
be
disapproved
or
that
the
case
would
be
remanded
to
the
federal
reserve
board
and
i
think
for
all
practical
purposes
that
would
moot
this
litigation.
the
burden
of
our
argument
would
--
is
going
to
be
that
the
only
matter
which
is
really
in
controversy
here
is
properly
a
matter
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
reserve
board
and
subject
only
to
review
of
that
board's
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
board's
order
is
attacked
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
we
are
in
effect
arguing
that
this
attack
is
an
impermissible
collateral
attack
upon
a
subject
matter
which
is
committed
to
the
board
and
is
properly
reviewable
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
it
held
up
to
await
the
outcome
of
this
injunctive
action.
it
entered
a
--
an
order
stating
that
it
was
doing
that.
as
i
was
about
to
say,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
i
think
that's
basic
too.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
my
argument
too
indicated
in
advance
will
be
that
the
matter
we're
dealing
with
here
is
solely
within
the
reserve
board's
jurisdiction
and
that
his
function,
the
comptroller's
function
is
an
independent
one
relating
to
different
matters
but
it
doesn't
--
he
has
no
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
the
holding
company
relationships.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
to
issue
a
certificate
of
authority?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no
because
he
has
to
make
additional
determinations.
the
qualifications
to
be
a
national
bank
are
clearly
within
the
comptrollers
authority
but
we
say
that
any
objection
to
the
national
bank
they
simply
upon
the
fact
that
it
is
owned
by
a
holding
company
is
outside
of
his
domain
that
that's
before
the
federal
reserve
board
the
comptroller
incidentally
participates
to
the
extent
of
making
his
recommendations
to
the
federal
reserve
board
on
the
question
of
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
holding
company
relationship.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
both
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
comptroller
are
in
agreement
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh!
no,
the
proceedings
confirm
what
i'm
saying
because
the
comptroller
submitted
his
recommendation
to
the
federal
reserve
board
as
it's
contemplated
by
the
statute,
the
holding
company
act
which
sets
out
the
procedures
which
the
federal
reserve
board
is
to
follow.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
we
are
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
your
honor
it's
quite
light.
i
do
wish
to
make
perfectly
clear,
however,
that
the
objections
to
this
action
are
quite
different.
that
here
we
claim
there
is
a
fundamental
jurisdictional
bar
in
the
fifth
circuit,
we
think,
the
merits
are
open.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
ruled
that
the
comptroller
was
about
to
violate
section
36
(c)
of
the
banking
act
of
1933,
a
section
which
adopts
by
reference
to
state
laws
governing
state
banks
certain
geographical
restrictions
upon
the
opening
of
branch
offices.
now,
we
think
that
this
is
a
fundamentally
wrong
decision
on
the
court
of
appeals'
part
because
there
is
no
basis
as
we
read
the
relevant
statutes
for
treating
a
separately
chartered
institution
whether
or
not
a
subsidiary
of
a
holding
company
as
a
branch
of
a
bank.
whitney-jefferson
to
be
sure
is
a
holding
company
subsidiary.
by
the
same
token,
it
is
also
an
affiliate
of
other
subsidiaries
of
whitney
holding
company
but
it
is
not
a
branch
as
that
term
is
used
or
has
ever
been
used
in
the
banking
industry.
branch
banking
and
holding
company
banking
are
different
institutions
and
have
long
been
recognized
as
such.
back
in
1931,
in
one
of
the
leading
articles
in
the
field
being
jefferson
fordham
to
cite
one
of
many
commentators
who
had
been
unanimous,
i
think,
in
making
this
observation
noted
and
i
quote
from
him
“that
the
rapid
spread
and
growth
of
group
i.e.
holding
company
banking
is
due
in
large
part
to
the
widespread
restrictions
on
branch
banking.”
a
holding
company
affiliate
as
i
shall
elaborate
later
is
not
a
branch
in
the
language
of
the
banking
act
and
it
is
not
a
branch
for
purposes
of
the
bank
holding
company
act.
this
i
would
emphasize
is
not
a
matter
of
insisting
on
correct
terminology
for
reasons
of
nice
fit.
the
considerations
which
determine
when
a
national
bank
is
qualified
to
organize
and
to
commence
operations
and
also
when
a
national
bank
may
establish
a
branch
office
are
committed
to
the
determination
of
the
comptroller
under
certain
specified
standards.
so
far
as
branching
is
concerned,
he
is
directed
by
section
36
(c)
to
refer
to
state
geographical
restrictions
upon
branch
banking.
congress,
however,
adopted
a
separate
statute,
the
holding
company
act
in
order
to
regulate
comprehensively
the
establishment
of
bank
holding
companies
and
the
operations
and
acquisitions
of
such
holding
companies.
that
statute
has
its
own
standards.
it
has
its
own
provisions
for
the
conduct
of
administrative
proceedings
and
the
subject
matter
with
which
it
deals
embraces
the
very
question
here
at
issue,
the
propriety
of
a
holding
company's
acquisition
and
in
certain
circumstances
of
a
bank
subsidiary
that
subject
matter
is
committed
to
the
judgment
of
the
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
board
and
there
are
no
geographical,
relevant
geographical
restrictions
in
the
bank
holding
company
act.
a
bank
holding
company
may
have
subsidiaries.
many
of
them
do
in
two
different
counties
or
parishes
of
the
state,
in
circumstances
where
a
bank
in
one
of
those
counties
would
not
be
free
to
establish
a
branch
in
the
other.
this,
we
shall
argue,
represents
a
most
deliberate
decision
on
congress'
part.
let
me
anticipate
now
to
the
extent
of
quoting
senator
robertson
who
was
the
sponsor
and
manager
of
the
senate
bill
which
became
the
bank
holding
company
act.
he
stated,
and
i'm
referring
to
page
56
of
the
governments
brief,
the
committee
that
is
the
senate
committee
decided
against
the
inclusion
of
a
provision
in
the
bill,
this
was
the
house
bill
which
would
automatically
apply
state
laws
concerning
branch
banking
to
bank
holding
company
operations.
this
provision
was
contained
in
the
house
bill
and
was
advocated
by
the
independent
bankers
association.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
“a
bank
branch
is
by
form
ownership
and
functions
vastly
different
from
a
bank
holding
company
affiliate.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh!
they
are
and
no
doubt
that
the
state
of
louisiana
could
pass
a
law
that
would
prohibit
the
formation
of
holding
companies
under
any
charter
from
that
state
but
we
think
the
branch
banking
restrictions
do
not
in
any
way
control
the
federal
reserve
board.
we
also
question
the
louisiana
statute
in
this
case
not
on
the
ground
that
louisiana
could
not
prohibit
the
chartering
of
bank
holding
companies
in
that
state
but
on
the
ground
that
it
cannot
permit
a
nationa
--
forbid
a
national
bank
to
open.
we
question
the
form
of
the
regulation
which
is
adopted
and
that
is
the
point
through
which
counsel
for
the
bank
is
going
to
address
himself
in
his
argument.
i'm
going
to
concentrate
on
the
relationship
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
the
bank
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
quite
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
congress
adopted
separate
--
a
separate
statute,
separate
standard,
separate
administrative
agencies
for
the
regulation
of
branch
banking
on
the
one
hand
and
holding
company
or
group
banking
on
the
other.
if
one
confuses
to
separately
chartered
corporations
which
are
subsidiaries
of
a
holding
company
which
are
treated
throughout
the
federal
statutes
as
affiliates
with
two
branches
of
the
same
institution
and
then
i
think
the
almost
inevitable
consequence
is,
one,
to
confuse
the
provisions
of
the
holding
company
act
and
its
standards
with
those
of
the
banking
act;
two,
to
confuse
the
authority
of
the
two
separate
agencies
which
congress
has
set
up
to
regulate
these
two
separate
institutions;
and
three,
to
confuse
the
provisions
for
judicial
review
which
made
thereafter
be
available
and
all
of
these
things
have
taken
place
in
this
case
as
i
see
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no
sir.
from
the
government's
standpoint,
these
confusions
that
i
have,
i
should
pause
a
moment
and
say
that
if
branch
banks
are
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
they
would
be
subject
of
course
to
those
requirements
not
for
purposes
relevant
here.
this
confusion
of
the
authority
of
the
two
agencies
is
the
matter
of
primary
concern
from
the
government's
standpoint
here.
whether
the
arrangement
proposed
by
the
whitney
group
is
a
good
one,
whether
it
should
have
been
approved
by
the
federal
reserve
board
or
not,
is
a
question
from
our
view
secondary
to
the
fundamental
issues
which
this
case
raises.
namely,
what
is
the
system
of
regulation,
where
does
the
administrative
responsibility
lie
and
what
has
the
congress
provided
with
respect
to
judicial
review.
let
me
emphasize
that
the
sole
point
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
this
case
is
that
the
whitney
bank
program
violates
branch
banking
restrictions.
now,
those
restrictions
are
inapplicable
to
holding
company
affiliates
and
if
as
we
are
convinced,
the
appraisal
of
a
holding
company
relationship
is
in
any
event
committed
exclusively
to
the
reserve
board's
jurisdiction.
it
follows
that
the
merits
of
this
proposal
submitted
by
the
whitney
group
can
only
be
examined
in
the
board
proceeding
and
on
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
assuming
for
the
moment
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
the
comptroller
--
if
the
com
--
comptroller
concludes
that?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
comptroller's
authority
is
to
determine
whether
the
applicant
for
certificate
authority
meets
the
qualifications
of
the
banking
act.
if
there's
something
--
if
the
holding
company
relationship
is
one
which
the
board
shouldn't
have
approved
because
it
was
for
an
illegitimate
purpose
or
there
was
--
there
were
any
bad
effects
which
might
be
envisioned,
i
think
that
that
is
solely
a
matter
that
the
board
can
determine
and
which
must
be
determined
upon
review
of
the
board's
order.
of
course,
the
comptroller
can
raise
any
question
he
wishes
before
the
board.
he
is
--
the
board
is
called
upon
under
the
statute
to
solicit
the
views
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
any
case
where
the
bank
holding
company
proposes
to
acquire
an
interest
in
the
national
bank
and
in
the
same
way
to
solicit
views
of
the
responsible
state
banking
commissioners
if
the
acquisitions
relate
to
state
banks.
those
recommendations
however
are
not
binding
the
decision
of
this
issue
if
submitted
to
the
federal
reserve
board.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
sham,
your
honor.
holding
companies
doubtless
are
formulated.
they
have
been
or
formed,
they
doubtless
have
been
for
40
years
because
there
are
certain
advantages
and
certain
disadvantages
in
going
that
route
as
opposed
to
going
another
route
such
as
operating
a
chain
banking
system
or
a
branch
banking
system.
insofar
as
there
are
any
relevant
policies
that
ought
to
be
considered
by
the
responsible
agency
in
deciding
whether
a
particular
holding
company
relationship
is
good,
bad
or
indifferent,
it
seems
to
me
those
objections
must
under
the
statutory
scheme
be
presented
to
the
board.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
courts
may
pass
on
it.
the
federal
reserve
board
had
said
this
is
a
holding
company.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'd
say
that
the
courts
can
determine
it
on
review
of
the
federal
reserve
board's
order,
your
honor.
here,
what
we
have
here
is
an
application
filed
with
the
federal
reserve
board
by
a
--
to
form
a
holding
company
and
to
acquire
a
stock
of
a
subsidiary
bank.
every
formal
requirement
of
a
holding
company
and
every
incident
of
the
holding
company
is
present.
now,
if
there
are
reasons,
if
there
are
objections
to
approving
the
establishment
of
this
holding
company
or
the
acquisition
which
this
holding
company
proposes
to
make
and
if
the
board
does
not
take
proper
account
of
all
of
the
relevant
policy
considerations
which
it
should,
i
say
those
are
certainly
matters
which
are
reviewable
but
they
are
reviewable
in
the
way
that
congress
is
provided,
namely
by
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
federal
reserve
board's
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor,
there
are
overlapping
incidents
in
every
one
of
these
good
relationships.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
stand
entirely
on
the
--
on
the
labels.
when
i
say
it's
a
holding
company,
i
mean
something
more
than
the
--
than
the
fact
that
whitney
and
its
applications
said
we
wish
to
form
a
holding
company.
i
mean
also
that
the
corporate
relationships
thereby
established
were
in
the
nature
of
holding
company
relationships.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
fifth
circuit
case?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh!
yes.
congress
has
provided
that
every
order
of
the
federal
reserve
board
approving
the
formation
of
a
holding
company
or
any
acquisition
by
a
holding
company
of
bank
stock
shall
be
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
subject
to
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
there
is
a
separate
question
as
to
the
effect
of
the
louisiana
statute
and
that
i
have
put
aside,
if
i
may,
because
counsel
for
the
bank
is
going
to
develop
his
time
to
that
point.
i
am
attempting
to
show
the
nature
of
that
speech
whether
it's
a
branch
bank
or
a
holding
company
and
the
--
and
to
establish
the
proposition
that
a
holding
company
proposes
whatever
ground
it's
attacked
upon,
whether
it's
a
good
or
a
bad
one
comes
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
in
other
words,
all
objections
which
are
made
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
bank
which
is
to
be
established
is
owned
by
a
holding
company
must
be
presented
to
the
federal
reserve
board.
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
stating
a
little
more
detail,
then
i
have
a
few
of
the
facts
which
i
haven't
put
fully
before
your
honors,
whitney
national
bank
of
new
orleans,
not
jefferson
parish
is
the
largest
bank
in
that
city.
new
orleans,
like
many
cities,
has
spread
and
whitney-new
orleans
desired
to
engage
in
multiple-unit
banking
and
to
follow
its
customers
into
jefferson
parish.
it
could
not
have
established
a
branch
in
jefferson
parish
because
louisiana
law
which
is
adopted
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
by
section
36(c)
provides
that
a
bank
may
not
establish
a
branch
in
a
parish
other
than
the
one
in
which
its
head
office
is
located.
whitney's
new
orleans
considered
two
other
well
worn
avenues
for
engaging
in
multiple-unit
banking.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
using
a
term
that
will
cover
branch
banking
and
chain
banking,
both.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
multiple-unit,
i
mean
to
cover
branch
banking,
chain
banking
and
holding
company
banking.
one
method
would
have
been
for
the
stockholders
of
whitney-new
orleans
to
form
a
bank
in
jefferson
parish.
this
had
been
done
by
two
of
whitney's
competitors.
one
of
these
the
second
largest
bank
in
new
orleans
known
as
the
national
bank
of
commerce
has
established
through
the
same
stockholders
an
affiliate
bank
known
as
the
national
bank
of
commerce
in
jefferson
parish
and
it's
widely
known
as
chain
banking.
apparently
for
reasons
of
convenience,
one
of
them
that
whitney-new
orleans
had
a
very
large
body
of
shareholders.
it
decided
that
it
would
seek
permission
to
form
a
holding
company
which
once
organized
would
hold
the
stock
both
of
whitney
and
new
orleans
and
of
the
new
bank
in
contemplation,
the
whitney-jefferson.
now,
this
type
of
group
or
holding
company
banking
is
also
widely
prevalent.
there
are
some
1800
banking
units
in
the
country
which
are
controlled
by
holding
companies.
now,
how
do
this
federal
reserve
board
and
the
comptroller
fit
into
this
picture?
first,
is
to
the
federal
reserve
board.
beginning
the
1950s,
the
board
had
expressed
its
concern
to
congress
that
although
it
had
some
limited
authority
under
the
banking
act
of
1933
to
deal
with
holding
company
practices,
there
was
no
limit
whatsoever
upon
the
ability
of
bank
holding
companies
to
expand
their
acquisitions.
congress
responded
by
adopting
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
under
section
3
of
that
statute
which
is
reprinted
in
page
81
of
our
brief,
it
is
unlawful
for
a
bank
holding
company
to
be
established
without
prior
approval
of
the
board.
moreover,
the
bank
holding
company
once
it
is
established
may
not
acquire
control
of
an
additional
bank
without
board
approval.
the
section
goes
on
to
state
that
if
a
bank
holding
company
proposes
to
acquire
a
national
bank,
the
comptroller
shall
be
notified,
so
that
he
may
state
his
recommendation.
there
are
provisions
for
public
notice
and
hearing
at
which
public
officials
and
other
interested
parties
may
participate
and
the
factors
which
the
board
is
to
consider
are
set
forth
in
section
3
(c)
which
begins
on
page
82.
there
are
five
criteria.
the
financial
history
and
condition
of
the
company
and
the
bank's
concern
their
prospects,
the
character
of
their
management,
the
convenience,
needs,
and
welfare
of
the
communities,
and
area
of
concern,
and
finally
whether
or
not
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
would
be
to
expand
the
size
of
the
bank
holding
company
system
beyond
limits
consistent
with
sound
banking,
the
public
interest
and
the
preservation
of
competition.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
in
the
case
of
an
acquisition
of
a
state
bank,
the
state
banking
commissioner
rather
than
the
controller
is
solicited
to
submit
his
recommendations.
finally,
as
i
indicated,
the
act
makes
provision
for
judicial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
now,
it
follows
from
what
i'd
said
i
think
that
if
the
whitney
interest
operating
in
holding
company
form
had
proposed
to
acquire
for
some
existing
bank
in
jefferson
parish,
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
whatever
to
file
any
application
of
any
kind
with
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
obtain
the
board's
approval
of
that
acquisition.
the
added
element
is
introduced
in
this
case
only
because
it
was
proposed
both
to
establish
a
holding
company
and
to
establish
a
new
national
bank
as
to
the
latter
feature.
therefore,
it
was
necessary
to
go
before
the
comptroller.
now,
word
about
his
authority,
he
is
directed
to
authorize
a
company
to
become
a
national
bank
if
it
meets
standards
which
are
set
forth
in
the
banking
act.
this
referred
to
the
provisions
of
that
act
alone.
he
has
to
determine
whether
the
amount
of
capital
paid
in
meets
the
requirements
of
the
statute
or
the
qualifications
of
the
stockholders
and
directors
and
other
matters
of
that
character.
the
banking
act
imposed
no
limitation
upon
expansion
by
means
of
group
banking
or
chain
banking.
now,
the
comptroller
is
essentially
an
examining
official.
he
makes
his
determination
whether
to
grant
a
certificate
ex
parte.
he
makes
detailed
examinations
but
he
is
not
directed
to
conduct
any
adversary
hearings
and
there's
no
provision
in
that
statute
in
the
bank
act
for
judicial
review
with
his
determinations.
the
whitney
bank
first
submitted
its
proposal
to
establish
this
new
national
bank
that
was
then
controlled
by
mr.
gidney
to
obtain
his
preliminary
approval
for
the
establishment
of
a
separately
chartered
bank
in
jefferson
parish.
after
examining
into
the
proposed
management,
its
capital
structure
and
so
forth
mr.
gidney
concluded
that
it
would
meet
the
qualifications
of
the
bank
act
and
gave
preliminary
approval
subject
to
the
board's
approval
of
the
holding
company
aspects
of
the
arrangement.
the
holding
company
proposal
was
then
duly
submitted
to
the
reserve
board.
notice
was
published
and
three
banking
competitors
expressed
written
condition.
the
present
respondents
were
silent,
the
comptroller's
recommendation
was
solicited
and
mr.
gidney
recommended
in
favor
of
approval.
a
public
hearing
was
ordered
to
afford
further
opportunity
to
any
interesting
party
to
participate.
this
was
noticed
in
the
federal
register
and
widely
publicized.
still
none
of
the
present
respondents
appeared
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
it
went
forward.
the
board
ultimately
entered
an
opinion
in
order
with
one
governor
dissenting
approving
the
application
to
establish
the
holding
company
and
to
make
the
acquisition
of
stock
in
whitney-jefferson.
in
its
opinion,
the
board
concluded
that
the
five
statutory
criteria
i
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago
had
been
met.
it
provided
further
that
the
stock
acquisition
was
not
to
be
affected
for
a
week
thereafter.
no
petitions
for
rehearing
were
filed
during
that
time.
more
than
a
month
after
the
board
had
approved
the
establishment
of
whitney
holding
and
the
acquisition
of
the
whitney-jefferson
stock,
respondents
were
heard
from
for
the
first
time.
at
that
point
they
commenced
an
action
against
the
comptroller
charging
him
with
a
violation
of
the
branch
banking
laws
and
only
some
days
later
did
they
first
petition
the
federal
reserve
board
for
reconsideration.
that
petition
was
denied
and
that
thereafter
respondents
appealed
the
board's
order
to
the
fifth
circuit
where
they
are
making
virtually
the
same
arguments
as
they
have
made
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
though
there
are
doubtless
similarities
between
branch
and
group
banking
there
are
also
important
differences.
in
branch
banking,
all
of
the
units
constitute
a
single
enterprise
with
one
capital
structure,
one
management,
one
set
of
directors.
a
deposit
in
a
branch
office
has
the
same
status
as
one
in
the
main
office
and
is
backed
by
the
capital
and
assets
of
the
entire
bank.
in
a
holding
company
system,
each
subsidiary
is
necessarily
a
separate
corporation.
each
has
its
own
capital
funds.
there
can
be
no
transfers
between
affiliated
banks.
each
has
its
own
borrowing
and
lending
limitations.
each
set
of
directors
is
personally
liable.
but
more
importantly,
congress
was
completely
aware
of
these
differences.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
may
be
directors
on
both
of
these.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
not
unless
the
federal
reserve
board
disapprove
the
character
of
the
management
(voice
overlap)
in
particular
case.
now,
in
the
banking
act
of
1933,
the
congress
made
a
comprehensive
study
of
group
banking,
chain
banking,
and
branch
banking.
it
treated
them
differently.
for
example,
in
section
61
the
congress
--
of
the
banking
act
the
congress
provided
a
measure
of
regulation
for
holding
companies,
a
holding
company
couldn't
vote
the
stock
of
a
--
it
couldn't
vote
bank
stock
without
a
permit
from
the
board.
however
--
and
also
the
1933
act
regulated
the
loans
by
or
to
affiliates
but
it
did
not
limit
acquisitions
by
holding
companies.
in
the
1950s,
as
i
indicated,
the
reserve
board
became
concerned
that
there
was
no
limitation
upon
the
possibilities
of
expansion
through
the
holding
company
device.
when
a
proposal
to
regulate
holding
company
acquisitions
came
before
the
congress
in
1955
and
1956,
the
independent
bankers
association
specifically
proposed
that
the
law
be
drawn
so
that
a
holding
company
could
not
have
subsidiaries
in
two
different
places
where
state
law
would
prohibit
a
single
bank
from
having
two
branches.
i
noted
at
the
outset
to
senator
robertson's
comment,
let
me
refer
very
briefly,
my
time
is
running
fast,
to
what
the
committee
stated
in
its
reports
which
appeared
at
pages
55
and
56
of
the
government's
brief.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
you
will
notice
i
won't
read
the
full
excerpt
that
the
committee
states
that
a
federal
standard
should
determine
and
that
the
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
holding
company
acquisition
should
not
be
referred
to
state
law.
the
ultimate
determination,
i
quote,
of
public
interest
in
the
national
bank
system
should
rest
with
the
appropriate
federal
authorities
and
even
more
pointedly
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
the
committee
decided
against
the
inclusion
of
the
provision
in
the
bill
that
would
automatically
apply
state
laws
concerning
branch
banking
to
bank
holding
company
operations.
the
purposes
of
branch
banking
laws
are
not
identical
with
the
purpose
of
this
bill
to
control
bank
holding
companies.
it
is
believed
that
the
bill
contains
adequate
provisions
to
regulate
bank
holding
company
operations
without
an
arbitrary
tie-in
with
branch
banking
laws.
thanks
to
us
that
the
unavoidable
conclusion
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
was
empowered
to
pass
on
this
acquisition
under
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
bank
holding
company
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
adopted
without
changes
by
the
(inaudible).
the
senate
version
became
the
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
referring
to
a
national
bank
at
this
point.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
holding
company
--
what
--
the
holding
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
there
is
room
certainly
for
the
federal
reserve
board
to
consider
when
it
passes
upon
an
application
to
acquire
an
interest
in
a
state
bank,
the
policies
of
the
state,
and
that
the
public
interest
factor
and
the
reference
to
the
areas
concerned
which
appears
in
section
3
(c)
of
the
holding
company
act
furnishes
that
latitude.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well
of
course,
in
many
respects
of
course
the
states
have
their
own
means
of
control
over
state
banks
or
state
chartered
institutions.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
state
can
--
can
pass
and
section
7
clearly
reserved
that
power,
a
law
as
many
states
have
some
16
or
17,
i
believe,
which
forbids
the
formation
of
any
bank
holding
company
in
that
state.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it
can
prohibit
the
formation
of
a
bank
holding
company
under
the
law
of
that
state.
actually,
louisiana
did
not
do
that.
it
chartered
the
way
of
holding
company.
it
could
have
had
a
law
that
it
would
not
charter
any
holding
companies
and
then
the
bank
holding
company
act
in
section
3
(d)
also
permit
the
--
permits
the
state
to
say
that
it
doesn't
want
any
of
its
banks
owned
by
an
out
of
state
holding
company
because
the
board
has
directed
not
to
approve
an
acquisition
by
a
holding
company
in
the
state
a
--
of
a
bank
--
of
bank
stock
in
state
b
if
state
b
has
a
law
against
such
acquisitions.
i
would
like
to
sum
up
in
just
a
few
sentences.
the
claim
here
is
that
the
comptroller
was
about
to
violate
branch
of
banking
restrictions.
we
say,
that
this
case
properly
speaking,
does
not
involve
branches
or
branch
banking.
it
involves
holding
company
affiliates.
we
say
the
congress
has
recognized
the
difference
for
many
years
and
without
exception
that
it
has
provided
a
completely
separate
and
comprehensive
means
of
regulating
expansion
through
holding
company
systems
that
this
regulation
is
by
the
board.
accordingly,
we
would
urge
that
this
attack
must
fail
whatever
may
be
said
pro
or
con
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
board's
decision
because
these
respondents
have
relied
on
the
wrong
statute,
they've
challenged
the
wrong
order
and
they
proceeded
in
the
wrong
court
and
that
i
say
should
be
conclusive
of
this
lawsuit
whatever
it
may
leave
for
decision
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
heard
about
the
matter
of
interim
relief.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
stress
that
what
the
district
of
columbia
courts
have
done
is
not
to
attempt
to
maintain
a
status
quo
pending
an
adjudication
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
action
before
them
was
for
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
the
comptroller
at
anytime
from
issuing
this
last
document
of
title
which
this
national
bank
needed
in
order
to
open
up.
so
far
as
remedy
pendente
lite
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
are
right
in
our
view
that
the
objections
which
are
being
made
in
this
case
should
have
been
made
before
the
fifth
circuit,
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
circuit
would
have
the
power
to
do
anything
that
was
necessary
or
appropriate
to
maintain
the
status
quo
while
the
matter
was
pending
before
it.
nor
i
think
is
there
any
likelihood
that
if
there
were
any
indication
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
possible
precipitant
action
by
the
comptroller
nor
is
there
any
likelihood
that
he
would
take
such
action
pending
review
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
was
about
to,
that
is
right
your
honor.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
any
necessity
for
a
stay
of
proceedings
pending
review
of
the
board's
order
could
be
satisfied
by
an
application
for
a
stay
to
the
court
in
which
review
of
that
order
is
pending.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly,
i
was
merely
suggesting
that
i
did
not
think.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no
dissent
from
that
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
actually
the
fifth
circuit
as
matters
now
stand
is
waiting
on
your
honors.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
catch
that
last,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
question
that
this
court
had
concluded
that
the
injunction
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
improperly
issued
but
also
concluded
that
the
matter
should
be
held
in
advance
until
the
fifth
circuit
completed
its
review
that
it
could
issue
an
appropriate
direction.
the
case
with
its
conclusion
i
think
comes
back
to
the
beginning
point
and
that
is
that
the
basis
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
the
board,
well
the
basis
of
it
stems
from
the
fact
that
this
bank
which
whitney
and
chris
proposed
to
open
is
owned
by
a
holding
company.
now,
if
that
ownership
is
objectionable
for
any
reason
it
seems
to
me
that
it
must
be
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
improperly
performed
its
function
in
approving
the
relationship.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
but
to
get
to
that
your
honor
they
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
branch
in
--
they
are
really
not
prepared
to
say
that
because
you
can't
say
that.
it's
obviously
a
holding
company
relationship
so
what
they
say
in
effect
and
i'm
going
to
quote
what
they
said
to
the
fifth
circuit,
this
is
the
brief
of
the
respondent
banks
in
the
fifth
circuit.
they
say
a
respondent,
and
they're
talking
about
the
federal
reserve
board,
has
knowingly
permitted
the
use
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
to
provide
national
banks
with
an
artifice
to
evade
regulatory
state
and
federal
laws.
now,
if
--
if
they
are
right,
if
the
bank
holding
company
has
been
abused
and
this
holding
company
is
somehow
illegitimate
in
its
conception
or
in
its
proposed
operations
then
i
should
think
it's
inescapable
that
the
appraisal
of
the
claim
that
the
holding
company
is
improper
certainly
must
be
for
the
only
agency
which
is
authorized
to
pass
on
a
holding
company
relationship
and
i
think
the
very
arguments
they
make
here
emphasize
that.
for
example,
your
honors
were
told
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
--
this
acquisition
would
be
anti
competitive
in
its
effects.
well,
the
board
has
directed
to
pass
upon
competition.
your
honors
were
told
that
the
source
of
the
funds
was
improper.
the
source
of
the
funds
was
actually
undivided
profits
which
were
free
monies
and
available
to
the
payment
of
dividends
instead
of
paying
the
dividends
out
and
the
shareholders
then
subscribing
them
a
new,
these
free
monies
were
paid
directly
into
whitney
holding
company
but
if
that
were
a
violation
of
any
provision
of
law,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
section
6
of
the
holding
company
act
and
the
federal
reserve
board
is
supposed
to
enforce
that
act,
so
that
i
think
all
of
the
issues
which
are
presented
if
there
is
any
merit
to
them
which
i'm
not
conceding
are
issues
for
the
federal
reserve
board
alone.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
do
argue
that
the
louisiana
act
cannot
stand
because
of
preemption
your
honor
without
reaching
any
constitutional
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
yes,
but
in
the
ultimate
sense
it
certainly
is.
i
thought
that
perhaps
justice
black
was
referring
to
the
arguments
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
retroactivity.
we
have
relied
in
our
brief,
i
have
not
dealt
with
this
point
in
oral
argument,
on
the
contention
that
the
violation
results
from
preemption
of
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
if
you
interpreted
section
7
is
doing
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
would
be
an
answer
to
my
preemption
argument,
i
don't
think
section
7
does
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
would
still
question
the
remedy
of
an
injunction
against
the
comptroller.
i
would
think
that
the
--
whether
in
the
light
of
the
louisiana
act,
this
relationship
should
have
been
approved
or
to
have
been
presented
in
the
first
instance
to
the
reserve
board
because
all
the
comptroller
does
is
to
determine
whether
a
bank
is
qualified
under
the
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act,
he
makes
some
examination
and
the
determination
of
formal
qualifications.
he
doesn't
pass
upon
issues
of
state
law
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
would
--
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
the
board,
i
would
suppose
that
the
board
in
the
first
instance
rather
than
the
comptroller
would
make
the
initial
decision
as
to
whether
the
action
it
proposed
to
take
was
forbidden
by
any
other
provision
of
law.
if
the
board
arguably
urge
then
that
issue
could
be
taken
up
on
appeal.
i
don't
see
that
the
effect
of
the
louisiana
law
was
an
issue
before
the
comptroller
or
that
it
is
properly
an
issue
before
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
comptroller
from
issuing
a
certificate
under
the
bank
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh!
i
think
your
honors
could
certainly
examine
the
relationship
of
the
louisiana
law
to
the
bank
holding
company
act
in
the
case
now
before
you.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
can't
consider
the
point
in
this
case,
what
i
was
suggesting
to
your
honor
was
that
the
asserted
rights
in
this
case
or
relate
to
whether
a
relationship
with
the
parents
to
subsidiary
should
have
been
approved
and
as
a
matter
of
primary
jurisdiction
i
would
think
that
that
issue
to
begin
with
was
before
the
federal
reserve
board
rather
than
the
--
rather
than
the
comptroller
having
in
mind
that
the
comptroller's
functions
are
solely
to
determine
the
more
or
less
formal
qualifications
imposed
by
the
banking
act
and
not
to
pass
upon
control
relationships
or
the
public
interest
which
is
involved
or
the
policies
which
are
involved
in
such
relationships.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sure
that
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
your
honors
were
to
conclude
that
the
louisiana
act
forbad
could
properly
invalidly
forbid
the
opening
of
the
bank,
i'm
sure
that
regardless
of
what
kind
of
an
order
were
entered
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
proposal
by
whitney
bank
because
i
would
have
to
say,
it
would
attempt
to
open
in
that
circumstance.
as
to
the
legal
argument
we
make
in
relation
to
the
louisiana
act,
it
is
grounded
as
our
brief
elaborates
upon
the
claim
that
with
respect
to
the
organization,
operation,
and
establishment
of
national
banks,
the
banking
act
occupies
the
field.
that
is
not
to
deny
the
possibility
that
the
louisiana
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
direct
the
shareholders
that
is
the
holding
company
to
divest
itself
of
its
interest
in
this
national
bank.
it
is
to
argue
that
the
state
has
no
authority
under
the
bank
act
to
prevent
the
opening
of
a
chartered
national
bank
order
require
its
closing.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
to
which
i
would
add
that
this
every
indication
that
it
was
not
intended
to.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
what
i
was
saying
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
question
was
that
i
did
not
think
section
7
did
authorize
such
a
statute
that's
all
i
was
saying
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
i
think
that
is
the
difference
of
course.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
have
it
here,
which
the
board
approved
--
i'll
give
you
the
sequence
of
several
events,
if
that
will
help.
the
board
approved
on
may
3
of
1962
the
acquisition.
an
action
was
first
brought
in
the
district
court
on
june
9
of
1962,
that
was
the
first
complaint.
a
petition
for
reconsideration
was
filed
with
federal
reserve
board
on
june
13th,
that
was
the
action
and
that's
the
fact.
once
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
board
denied
rehearing
on
june
25th.
on
june
30th,
the
board's
order
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
on
july
10th
act
275
became
effective.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
brief
indicate
it,
i
don't
recall
it.
it
was
in
may,
i'm
told.
i
don't
have
the
exact
date.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
there
was
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
then
a
preliminary
injunction
by
judge
(inaudible),
as
i
recall.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
june
9,
it's
correct.
