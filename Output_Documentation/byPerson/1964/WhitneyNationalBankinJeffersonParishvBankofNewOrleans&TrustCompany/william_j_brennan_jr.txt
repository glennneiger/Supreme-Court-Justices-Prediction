justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
he
be
mandamus
to
issue
a
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
the
board
federal
reserve
get
approved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
the
comptroller
concludes
the
holding
company
devices
a
sham
is
really
branch
banking,
couldn't
he
do
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it's
--
hopefully
for
the
board,
this
argument
then
were
relevant
to
the
case
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
to
the
district
of
orleans?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
with
that
--
but
they
--
they
can't
actually
take
deposits
for
the
purposes
of
increasing
the
loan
limit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
a
piece
proportionate
to
whatever
is
its
own
loan
limit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
mr.
merrigan
i
have
difficulty
reading
that
letter
as
saying
that.
all
it
says
is
at
first
they
say
those
arguments
without
substantial
merit
and
in
any
event.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
implication
is
led
--
the
alleged
matter
from
that
letter
that
they
did
consider.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
addition
that
the
--
that's
preceded
by
and
the
judgment
of
the
board
that
those
arguments
are
without
substantial
merit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they,
meaning
those
arguments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
basically
i
gather
your
position
is
that
the
error
committed
here
is
not
necessarily
that
of
the
board.
it's
primarily
that
with
the
comptroller's.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
he
in
issuing
this
certificate
or
attempting
to
issue
it
had
done
violence
to
the
branch
banking
restrictions
of
the
act
which
he
supposed
to
administer,
that's
in
your
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
now
mr.
--
well,
are
you
going
to
get
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
participation
did
--
did
your
clients
have
in
any
of
the
proceeding
leading
to
the
certificates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
participation
if
any
was
there
before
the
comptroller
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
we're
now
reviewing
could
the
case
go
back
to
the
comptroller
or
could
he
make
findings
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
and
conclude
that
this
is
not
branch
banking
because
there's
a
valid
holding
company?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
end
of
the
road
in
other
words.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
i
thought
your
position
basically
what
you
told
me
earlier
the
comptroller
has
violated
section
36
because
this
is
actually
a
branch
bank,
isn't
that
in
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now
that
--
that
has
not
--
the
new
louisiana
statute
has
no
relevance
to
that
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
would
have
prevailed,
we
also
could
tell
him
that
your
view
would
be
pending
(voice
overlap)
in
that
case
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
why
go
through
all
the
business
with
an
application
to
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
section
7
is
authority
to
the
states
to
have
just
this
point
of
statute
premature.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
preemption
problem
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
do
you
have
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
about
--
what
--
on
the
premise
it
did?
does
the
government
have
another
position
about
the
section
5
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
may
be
right.
and
perhaps,
the
most
properly
blown
to
the
fifth
circuit
so
to
speak
but
it's
a
little
unusual
isn't
it
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
section
7
did
authorize
section
5
and
this
is
an
absolute
prohibition.
if
you
find
them
on
every
agencies
of
the
federal
government
that
we
go
all
through
the
rig
in
the
row
and
sending
them
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
section
7
can't
be
given
the
scope
in
this
act
with
modifying
that
consequence
of
the
bank
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
the
date
when
that
act
was
introduced
in
the
louisiana
legislature?
