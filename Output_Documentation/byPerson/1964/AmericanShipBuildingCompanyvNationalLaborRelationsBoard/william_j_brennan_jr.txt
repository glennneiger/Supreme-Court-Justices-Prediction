mr.
tyson,
can
you
tell
us
what
happened
in
the
last
contract
expired
on
august
15,
1963?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

insurance
agents
itself
as
i
remember,
no
impasse
is
meet
in
that
bargaining
when
the
union
resorted
to
facts
that
they're
characterized
as
legitimate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
speaking
of
insurance
agents.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
in
--
in
insurance
agents,
i
may
be
wrong
in
my
facts.
my
recollection
is
that
bargaining
had
not
reached
an
impasse
when
the
union
resorted
to
the
tactics
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
do
you
say
that
if
this
is
permissible
that
your
position
is
it's
permissible
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
use
the
lockout
only
impasse
have
been
followed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
facts
here
in
any
event
i
gather
in
the
--
on
your
facts
here
are
that
these
were
never
heard
after
impasse.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
come,
does
this
argument
finally
get
you
to
the
point
that
there
never
can
be
circumstances
in
which
outside
of
the
multiemployer
set
up
that
single
employer
may
resort
to
lockout.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
circumstances
would
the
employer
resort
to
lockout
that
would
not
have
the
effect
to
describe
the
force
on
the
right
to
strike?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we're
looking
for
general
principle
where
the
board
suggests
them
that
the
resort
to
the
lockout
weapon
is
never
permissible
except
as
a
defensive
move.
