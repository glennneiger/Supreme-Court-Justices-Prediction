justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
is
that
open
under
the
grant
of
certiorari
here.
i
thought
we
had
granted
certiorari
requesting
to
and
your
petition
which
is
a
broad
question.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
isn't
that
why
this
case
is
here.
we're
not
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
here
to
consider
whether
under
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
just
to
avoid
a
strike.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
mr.
tyson,
the
board
itself
recognizes
in
its
decisions,
a
series
of
decision,
that
a
lockout
is
permissible
under
their
view
of
the
statute
to
avoid
extraordinary
losses
threatened
by
an
imminent
strike.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
here
there
has
been
a
factual
determination
by
the
board
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
against
you
on
that
particular
phase
of
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
really,
i'll
go
back
to
what
i
said,
aren't
you
under
the
grant
here
confined
to
your
substantive
argument?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
saying
that
they're
not
confined?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
what
are
those
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
would
say
that
this
would
not
depend
upon
an
impasse
being
reached
in
the
negotiations.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
about
--
what
is
your
view
about
before
an
impasse
is
reached?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
got
to
say
that
because
you
said
in
formulating
if
you
said,
well
he's
entitled
to
go
to
the
bargaining
table
armed
with
this
economic
weapon.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
don't
have
here,
however,
any
anti-union
purpose
in
the
lockout.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
was
the
erie
resistor
you
add,
the
employer
resort
to
a
device,
the
super-seniority
for
replacements
for
people
who
didn't
have
to
come
and
strike
which
really
in
the
experience
of
industrial
experience
makes
the
final
settlement
very
difficult.
there
you
don't
have
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
assuming
that
mr.
come
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
there
is
something
about
the
spirit
of
statute
that's
involved.
you're
dealing
here
with
a
pretty
fundamental
thing.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
i
--
i
would
like
you
for
a
moment
that
anytime
in
your
argument,
address
yourself
to
the
basic
concept
that
whether
you
believe
when
the
congress
adapted
this
statute
which
was
designed
primarily
to
prevent
anti-union
device,
the
wagner
operation.
it
was
never
contemplated
that
economic
weapons
shouldn't
be
pretty
equal
in
terms
of
being
used
one
against
the
other.
short
of
what
you
have
correctly
pointed
out
that
it
was
obviously
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
prevent
to
be
used
to
destroy
a
union.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
quite
understand
the
use
of
the
word
defensive.
suppose
this
situation
--
suppose
that
the
union
as
like
the
insurance
agents'
situation
has
a
series
of
short
strikes
to
push
bargaining
law,
they
feel
the
employer
is
not
doing
well
by
then
in
the
bargaining
process.
and
suppose
that
after
that
has
taken
place
for
a
little
while,
the
employer
says,
“well,
perhaps
i
can
do
a
bit
of
the
same
and
since
they
know
this
out
they
will
shutdown
next
week,
we'll
lock
you
out.”
would
you
think
that
these
negotiations
are
dragging,
do
you
think
our
position
is
right
and
we
don't
claim
economic
necessity
that
we
think
we
ought
to
get
a
deal.
and
we
think
that
the
two
can
play
this
game.
well,
how
do
you
interpret
that
type
of
lockout?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
union
disclaimed
the
right
to
hold
full
scale
strike
in
its
literature,
in
its
resolution
then
in
its
statement.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
where
do
you
find
then
the
board's
decision,
the
position
that
one
knows
that
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
difficulty
here
is
this,
you,
i
think,
correctly
stated
strike
is
a
serious
business,
the
union
does
not
ordinarily
engage
in
a
strike
and
this
was
the
last
resort,
all
of
which
i
think
industrial
history
teach
it.
but
now
it
turned
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
it's
not
always
so.
it
turned
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
you
had
strikes
that
occur
in
every
exploration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
an
impasse
was
reached
and
this
employer,
you
could
interpret
this
case
to
be
this
employer's
said,
“well,
this
time
we're
going
to
call
the
two
a
little
bit.”
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
accepting
that
why
wouldn't
employer
justified
in
saying
to
get
the
type
of
the
agreement
that
we
need
in
order
to
carry
on
our
business
without
saying
that
there's
a
lot
of
business,
i
think
we'll
have
to
just
--
this
ought
to
be
done
to
bring
a
sense
of
realism
into
the
collective
bargaining
process.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
aren't
there
straight
focus
as
to
follow
the
--
that
has
covered
both.
aren't
their
obvious
restraints
upon
the
employer
or
not
whether
to
shut
down
the
plant,
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
what
do
you
say
from
this
fact,
that
of
85%
of
all
labor
agreement
usually
contain
a
clause.
it
says,
during
the
term
of
this
agreement,
the
union
shall
not
strike
and
the
employer
shall
not
lockout.
isn't
there
sort
of
an
implication
at
least
from
that
statement
that
when
the
agreement
expires
that
we're
both
free
to
fight
it
out
if
we
have
to?
isn't
that
the
kind
of
implication
you
get
from
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
tyson,
how
would
you
answer
this,
which
i
think
is
underlies
and
splashed
out
of
the
last
moment.
for
your
type
of
employer
here
it
seems
a
pretty
legitimate
weapon
to
lockout,
the
union
has
done
so
in
a
series
of
occasions.
take
the
newly
organized
plant
where
the
union
has
gone
through
difficult
experience
in
organizing.
it
never
has
a
contract
and
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
first
negotiation
when
the
employer
says
not
--
i
accept
the
union,
i
accept
this
certification,
but
i'm
going
to
close
this
plant
down
because
we're
not
going
to
pay
what
the
union
wants.
do
you
think
the
union
would
be
that
the
right
to
strike
or
the
survival
of
the
union
wouldn't
be
amount
too
much
if
that
were
validated?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
does
the
employer
says,
i
don't
want
to
break
the
union,
all
i
want
is
to
preserve
my
existing
wage
scale
which
i
think
is
the
only
way
economically
i
can
operate,
and
then
therefore
in
order
to
make
clear
that
i'm
serious
about
this
and
that
i
better
shut
so
the
people
will
be
able
to
influence
their
union
to
make
this
highly
reasonable
deal.
