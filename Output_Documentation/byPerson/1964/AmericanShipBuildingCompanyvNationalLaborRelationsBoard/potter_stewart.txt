justice
potter
stewart
the
rationale
of
that
case
was
--
that
that
was
permissible
there
to
protect
the
bargaining
unit,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
have
that
the
--
you
don't
have
that
here
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
more
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
equate
--
you
equate
the
employer's
rights
to
lockout
with
the
employees'
rights
to
strike?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
your
â€“
mr.
come,
is
it
your
interpretation
that
just
took
place
during
the
course
of
bargaining
or
after
an
impasse
had
been
reached?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
what
you
said
was
with
that
bargaining
position
as
though
this
was
during
the
bargaining
before
an
impasse
is
reached
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
--
i
just
wondered
about
the
legitimate
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
come
is
this
right
or
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
before
any
--
before
any
national
labor
legislation,
there's
no
question
at
all
under
the
law
of
the
employer's
right
to
lockout.
justice
potter
stewart
for
any
reason
and
there
was
considerable
question
about
the
employees'
right
to
strike
for
various
legal
reason.
and
therefore
that
was
a
very
good
reason
to
expressly
and
specifically,
explicitly
protect
the
right
to
strike
in
the
national
labor
legislation
that
there
was
no
reason
at
all
to
affirm
a
right
that
already
existed
that
is
the
employer's
right
to
--
employer's
right
to
lockout.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
discussion
of
this
at
all
in
the
--
to
be
found
with
the
legislative
history
either
wagner
act
or
the
taft-hartley
act
or
the
legislation
in
1959
the
labor
management
disclosure
act.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn't
mr.
come
that
--
you
--
you
correctly
said
that
the
basic
underlying
spirit
of
this
legislation
was
to
equalize
--
was
to
equalize
and
come
you
say
into
a
balance.
and
didn't
congress
proceed
upon
the
assumption
that
the
employer
had
the
right
to
lockout
and
didn't
the
congress
therefore
explicitly
confer
the
right
to
strike
in
order
to
equalize
this.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
agree
with
me
don't
you
that
the
employer
prior
to
any
national
legislation
did
have
the
right
to
lockout.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
agreed
further
that
the
right
to
strike
was
in
a
serious
question
in
the
said
area.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
congress
gave
it
to
him,
i
said
the
congress
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
he
had
it.
justice
potter
stewart
probably
there's
a
big
difference.
a
lockout
is
a
temporary
thing
and
the
replacement,
the
mackay
replacement
is
permanent.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
mr.
come
we
talked
about,
we
--
we've
talked
about
the
basic
purpose
of
this
legislation
as
to
give
the
equality
of
bargaining
power.
and
bargaining
power
assumes
implicit
in
bargaining
power
are
sanctions
in
the
background.
now,
both
sides
have
been
clearly
and
explicitly
recognized
with
the
basic
background
ultimate
sanction
on
the
side
of
the
employees
is
the
right
to
strike.
and
then
i
had
it
already
though,
that
implicit
also
on
the
other
side
was
the
right
to
lockout
otherwise
where
is
the
power,
where
is
the
bargaining
power
on
the
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
--
you
might
be
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
if
you
--
if
there
is
strike
or
a
lockout
before
an
impasse
or
refusal
to
bargain
and
in
good
faith
which
is
also
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
have
the
duty
to
bargain
to
an
impasse
generally
speaking.
