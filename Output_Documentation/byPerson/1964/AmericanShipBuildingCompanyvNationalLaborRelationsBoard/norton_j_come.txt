mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
that
as
we
view
it,
the
second
position
that
mr.
tyson
has
urged
is
not
before
this
court.
on
the
findings
of
a
majority
of
the
board
which
were
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
company
here
at
the
time
that
it
locked
out
or
laid
off
its
employees
did
not
have
any
reasonable
basis
to
anticipate
a
strike.
so
this
is
not
a
case
that
sits
within
the
so
called
economic
necessity
of
betts
cadillac
line
of
case.
the
dissent
of
chairman
mcculloch
and
the
board
went
simply
to
that
factual
issue.
he
did
not
just
reach
the
issue
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
indicated
that
he
was
not
reaching
or
deciding
in
a
way
different
from
the
way
the
majority
of
the
board
has
decided.
the
legal
issue
which
is
before
the
court
here
namely
whether
or
not
a
single
employer
has
the
right
to
use
the
lockout
as
an
offensive
weapon,
in
other
words,
to
advance
his
bargaining
position
even
though
he
is
not
faced
with
any
or
has
no
reasonable
basis
for
anticipating
that
a
strike
will
be
called
or
that
he
is
facing
any
unusual
operating
problem.
you
might
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
the
examiner
found
that
an
impasse
had
been
reached
and
that
finding
was
not
disturbed
by
the
board,
so
that
we
do
have
an
impasse
in
this
case.
however,
i
think
that
the
logic
of
mr.
tyson's
argument
affords
to
basis
for
impinging
it
to
an
impasse.
i
think
that
it's
logically
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
to
--
to
get
his
contract
terms
rather
than
the
terms
that
the
union
was
demanding.
i
might
add
here
that
the
union
here
offered
not
indefinitely
to
extend
the
current
contract
which
had
a
no-strike
clause
but
they
extended
until
a
new
agreement
had
been
reached.
so
there
wasn't
anything
indefinite
about
their
offer
here
to
forego
a
strike
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
continued
working
at
the
lorain
yard
which
had
worked
in
it
well
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
layoff
at
the
--
of
the
south
chicago
yard
which
is
the
only
yard
that's
involved
in
this
case.
now,
earning
to
the
legal
issue
which
we
believe
is
here,
we
don't
--
i
submit
think
that
it's
very
helpful
to
try
to
answer
it
in
terms
of
whether
the
lockout
is
the
corollary
of
the
--
of
the
strike.
that
really
begs
the
question
what
we're
dealing
with
here
are
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
what
we
find
there
is
that
section
7
and
13
of
the
act
specifically
protect
the
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
activities,
collective
bargaining
and
the
right
to
strike.
indeed,
section
13
says
that
the
right
to
strike
shall
not
be
interfered
with
except
insofar
as
the
act
specifically
provides
otherwise.
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
buffalo
linen
case,
there
is
no
specific
protection
for
employer
weapons
where
the
lockout
or
any
other
economic
weapon.
mr.
norton
j.
come
for
any
reason.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
taking
the
promise
that
the
employer
could
lockout
for
any
reason,
he
could
also
lockout
for
the
purpose
of
beating
a
union.
now,
there's
no
question
that
under
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act,
he
can
no
longer
do
that.
now,
you
don't
have
a
specific
provision
of
the
act
that
deals
with
that
problem
in
so
many
terms.
what
you
have
is
8
(a)
(1)
which
is
phrased
generally
in
terms
of
making
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
by
interference,
restraint
and
coercion
to
interfere
with
the
employee's
organizational
rights.
we
submit,
that
congress
decidedly
left
that
general
so
that
the
board
would
on
a
case-by-case
basis
have
the
power
to
balance
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
employers
against
the
impairment
of
employee
rights
involved
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
way
congress
left
the
question
of
how
much
of
the
lockout
was
to
be
left
privileged
to
be
sure
the
lockout
as
this
court
recognized
in
buffalo
linen
is
not
completely
prohibited.
but
on
the
other
hand
nor
is
it
completely
permitted
and
the
extent
to
which
it
is
privileged,
we
submit,
has
been
left
to
the
board
subject
to
judicial
review
to
be
sure
under
the
application
of
the
balancing
test
under
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
only
that
indicated
discussion
that
i
can
find
is
a
bit
of
the
wagner
act
history
which
is
referred
to
by
the
court
in
our
footnote
in
buffalo
linen.
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
wagner
act
originally
provided
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
employer
to
interfere,
restraint,
coerce,
lockout,
and
in
the
draft
as
enacted,
the
word
lockout
was
eliminated
but
i
submit
that
that
is
not
necessarily
dispositive
because
even
though
it's
eliminated
it
clearly
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
to
lockout
for
an
anti-union
purpose.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
your
honor,
you
do
not.
however,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
erie
resistor,
there
are
some
acts
that's
so
severely
impinged
upon
protected
employee
activity
that
they
may
be
made
properly
found
to
violate
the
act
even
though
there
is
not
an
anti-union
purpose
in
invidious
sense.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
true.
however,
i
reread
the
erie
resistor
again
in
the
light
of
that
observation,
your
honor
which
you've
pointed
out
in
the
brown
case
and
i
find
that
although
that
was
a
factor,
that
was
one
of
five
factors
that
the
court
enumerated
as
a
justification
for
the
board's
position.
and
the
other
four
factors
went
to
the
immediate
impact
of
the
super-seniority
in
terms
of
breaking
up
the
strike.
moreover,
buffalo
linen
which
recognized
that
this
lockout
problem
is
within
the
area
of
balancing
didn't
draw
the
line
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
merely
a
weapon
that
would
expend
itself
after
the
economic
contest
or
whether
it
went
beyond.
i
submit
further
that
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
warrants
that
sort
of
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
would
like
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
one
of
the
basic
purposes
of
the
act
is
this
evident
from
the
section
1
was
to
equalize
the
bargaining
power
of
employees
and
employers
and
the
way
that
--
one
of
the
basic
ways
in
which
the
congress
thought
to
do
that
was
to
protect
the
right
of
the
employees
to
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
and
to
engage
in
a
concerted
activities
from
mutual
aid
and
protection
and
as
part
of
that
panoply
as
this
court
has
recognized
to
safeguard
the
right
to
strike
and
now
what
i'd
like
to
show
is
the
very
serious
consequences
that
a
bargaining
lockout
has
on
the
right
of
employees
to
strike
which
this
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
affirmative
indication
that
that
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
that
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
though
that
to
give
the
employer
the
right
to
lockout
far
from
equalizing
the
situation
would
give
him
an
unduly
advantage
that
would
keep
the
scales
in
his
favor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
but
congress
took
it
away.
we
all
acknowledge
at
least
where
it's
use
to
beat
the
union.
now,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
didn't
take
it
away
in
other
situations
where
its
use
would
unduly
cripple
protected
the
employee
rights
and
i
would
like
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
what
this
does
to
the
right
to
strike.
i
should
point
out,
however,
before
i
do
that
that
this
issue
has
come
up
in
four
circuits.
the
board
has
been
sustained
in
three
circuits.
i
think
maybe
--
maybe
one.
in
the
third
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit,
the
district
of
columbia
and
most
recently
in
the
second
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
hays
which
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
only
circuit
that
i
didn't
see
it
our
way
was
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
dalton
case.
so
we've
been
erring
this
problem
through
the
circuits
but
getting
back
to
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
it
is
the
--
it
is
the
board's
judgment
and
courts
have
agreed
with
this
--
have
agreed
that
the
strike
weapon
can
be
fully
effective
only
if
the
employees
and
their
union
representative
have
the
right
to
control
its
use
to
decide
when
to
strike,
when
not
to
and
if
to
strike
for
how
long,
for
the
obvious
reasons.
generally,
a
strike
is
called
as
a
--
as
a
last
resort
where
it
involves
high
cost
to
the
employees
and
to
the
--
and
to
the
unions.
as
proof
of
that
in
the
1964
strikes
represented
a
fraction
of
1%
of
total
work
time.
because
for
the
employees,
it
means
a
lost
of
wages
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
does
not.
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
where
it
is
used
for
a
currently
defensive
purpose
and
does
not
preempt
the
use
of
the
strike
weapon.
the
betts
cadillac
situation,
if
the
union
were
to
make
it
clear
that
was
to
fall
a
strike
and
that
faced
the
employer
with
an
unusual
operating
problems
such
as
the
head
inventories
that
were
going
to
spoil,
the
working
process
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
is
basically
the
line
that
the
board
has
drawn
because
in
--
it
used
that
as
an
offensive
weapon.
it
preempts
the
use
of
the
strike
weapon
altogether.
a
union
might
never
have
intended
to
call
a
work
stoppage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
most
cases,
the
strike
weapon
achieves
its
purpose
existing
merely
as
the
threat
of
a
strike
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
discovery.
the
bargaining
lockout
enables
the
employer
to
call
a
work
stoppage
when
the
union
might
never
have
anticipated
calling
one.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
in
that
case,
you
might
well
say
that
the
union
has
already
indicated
that
it
is
going
to
use
the
strike
weapon
and
it
has
made
it
difficult
for
the
employer
to
operate
and
that
gets
you
pretty
close
to
a
betts
cadillac
line
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board's
position
is
not
so
wooden
that
it's
going
to
force
an
employer
to
operate
under
circumstances
where
the
union
is
playing
games
and
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
you
find
in
all
of
the
lockout
cases
since
duluth
bottling
in
over
the
years,
an
indication
that
the
board
looks
pretty
carefully
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
cases.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
on
the
findings
of
the
board
which
have
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
he
had
no
reasonable
basis
for
anticipating
that
there
was
going
to
be
either
a
full-pledged
strike
or
one
of
these
quickie
deals
at
any
point
in
the
picture.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
for
the
simple
reason
that
giving
the
employer
that
power
does
in
this
particular
case
under
these
facts
throws
employees
out
of
work
who
might
never
have
gone
out
on
work
and
they
are
out
of
work.
now,
the
employer
has
these
means
that
at
his
disposal,
i
mean
the
basic
justification
for
resorting
to
the
lockout
and
the
circumstances
that
we
have
here
is
for
him
to
get
his
contract
terms
rather
than
those
that
the
union
wants.
well,
he
can
do
that
without
the
lockout
weapon.after
all,
the
employer
controls
the
employment
conditions.
if
the
union
us
unwilling
to
strike,
he
can
say,
“well,
i
think
you're
early
after
an
impasse.
i'm
going
to
continue
to
operate
under
the
existing
conditions.
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it.”
and
if
they
don't
want
to
strike,
they've
got
to
continue
the
work
under
the
existing
conditions.
moreover,
after
an
impasse,
he
could
even
alter
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
the
union
cannot
alter
the
existing
conditions
unless
if
the
employer
is
unwilling,
unless
it
has
the
strike
weapon.
moreover,
the
employer,
the
other
justification
that
he
has
for
using
the
lockout
in
the
circumstances
we
have
here
is
that,
“well,
if
i'm
going
to
have
a
work
stoppage
rather
take
it
now
rather
than
later
on
when
maybe
i'm
going
to
be
busier
and
it
will
hurt
me
more.”
well,
he
has
a
substantial
means
at
his
disposal
for
alleviating
that
problem
without
the
lockout.
he
has
the
right
that
mackay
recognizes
to
replace
the
strikers
if
they
go
out
on
strike
and
for
that
reason
among
others
the
lockout
is
not
the
corollary
of
the
strike.
the
lockout
is
in
the
right
to
shut
down
the
plant
completely
under
the
--
when
the
people
strike
and
that's
a
great
deterrent
as
to
whether
they
will
strike
or
not,
they
run
the
risk
of
being
replaced.
now,
the
question
was
asked,
“well,
isn't
--
isn't
the
lockout
less
horrendous
than
super-seniority
in
erie
or
the
mackay
right
of
replacement.
i
submit
that
in
the
very
real
sense,
the
lockout
is
worst,
much
more
severe
in
its
impact
on
employee
rights
than
the
mackay
right
of
replacement
for
this
reason.
the
mackay
right
of
replacement
operates
only
after
the
union
has
decided
to
call
a
strike.
i
mean
the
union
has
made
the
choice,
they've
elected
to
take
that
drastic
step,
until
they
do
there's
no
right
of
replacement.
secondly,
having
struck
still
not
all
strikers
are
affected,
it's
only
those
that
the
employer
is
able
to
replace.
with
respect
to
the
lockout,
however,
the
employees
have
--
have
no
choice
in
the
matter.
even
those
that
may
not
have
even
had
gone
out
on
strike
had
the
union
called
one
are
thrown
out
of
work
and
we
submit
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
what
the
board
submits
that
on
the
balance
--
the
balance
on
the
one
hand,
the
impairment
of
the
right
to
strike
which
this
court
is
repeatedly
emphasized.
congress
has
shown
a
marked
solicitude
for
it
and
it
is
not
to
be
impaired
unless
you've
got
some
specific
provision
permitting
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
that
view,
i
respectfully
submit,
overlooks
the
fact
or
at
least
does
not
fully
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
these
other
alternatives
at
his
disposal,
the
utterances
that
were
made
at
the
--
at
the
time
that
the
lockout
is
the
corollary
of
the
right
to
strike
were
made
at
a
very
early
stage
of
the
development
of
this
law.
it
wasn't
until
some
years
after
the
act
was
enacted
that
this
court
recognized
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
employer's
right
to
replace.
it
wasn't
until
many
years
thereafter,
i
think
in
the
early
days
of
taft-hartley
that
it
was
finally
established
that
the
employer
had
the
right
to
act
unilaterally
after
an
impasse
has
been
reached.
and
when
you
take
into
account
these
alternatives
that
are
available
to
the
employer
under
the
scheme
of
our
act
and
put
them
into
the
equation,
i
submit,
that
the
board
was
not
unreasonable
in
concluding
in
this
that
giving
the
employer
the
right
to
lockout
in
these
circumstances
just
tips
the
scale
too
far
as
judge
hays
pointed
out
in
the
second
circuit
case.
it
blunts
the
strike
weapon
and
instead
of
establishing
the
equality
which
the
act
seeks
to
attain,
it
tips
the
scales
unduly
in
the
employer's
favor.
now,
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
--
to
be
frank
with
you
that
that's
one
interpretation.
the
other
interpretation
which
i
think
i
submit
is
equally
reasonable
is
that
many
times
collective
bargaining
agreements
contained
provisions
with
respect
to
things
that
are
admittedly
unlawful.
i
mean
you
have
provisions
in
there.
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
union
membership.
so
you
could
say
that
the
fact
that
there's
no
lockout
there,
it's
merely
an
attempt
to
cover
something
which
might
well
be
--
that
to
give
a
contract
remedy
for
something,
it
might
also
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
if
i
might
have
just
one
half
second
more
mr.
chief
justice.
the
other
question
--
reason
for
it
may
well
be
that
oftentimes
there's
a
semantic
problem
as
to
whether
you
got
a
strike
or
a
lockout.
even
though
the
union
has
taken
the
initiative
in
calling
the
work
stoppage,
it
might
be
termed
either
by
the
union
or
by
other
people
as
a
lockout
because
it
was
the
employer's
action
that
engendered
the
impasse
that's
caused
the
lockout.
and
i
think
that
part
of
the
reason
why
the
terms
are
used
together
might
be
to
cover
such
a
situation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
to
my
knowledge
your
honor,
it's
not
very
widespread
at
all.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
is
because
it's
been
pretty
well
settled.
one
of
the
reasons
may
be
that
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
the
employer
couldn't
use
a
lockout
for
this
purpose.
what
would
happen
should
this
court
rule
otherwise,
i
don't
want
to
speculate
on,
i
think
it
might
well
be
more
widespread
where
this
court
to
rule
that
it
was
a
permissible
weapon.
up
to
now,
it
has
not
been
a
significant
factor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
he
feels
that
he
can
get
a
contract
on
his
own
terms
though,
however,
it
may
be
worth
it.
particularly,
if
he
can
do
it
at
the
time
when
he
thinks
that's
a
slack
season
or
he
had
built
up
inventories.
thank
you.
