mr.
william
s.
tyson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
temporary
layoff
or
lockout
by
the
american
ship
building
company
which
occurred
on
august
11,
1961.
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
to
a
few
of
the
salient
facts
with
the
court's
permission.
the
case
was
originally
brought
charging
violations
of
section
8
(a)
(1),
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
was
brought
against
all
of
the
shipyards
which
this
company
operates
in
buffalo,
new
york,
toledo
and
lorain,
ohio
and
chicago,
illinois.
however,
the
board
dismissed
the
charge
of
failure
to
bargain
on
the
8
(a)
(5)
and
held
only
with
respect
to
the
chicago
shipyard
that
there
had
been
violations.
i'd
like
to
call
also
to
the
attention
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
right,
yes
sir.
this
is
a
single
employer
layoff
or
lockout
as
compared
with
the
one
which
you
gentlemen
heard
yesterday
involving
the
multiemployer
lockout.
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
fact
that
this
was
a
three
to
two
decision
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
chairman
of
the
board,
chairman
mcculloch
wrote
the
minority
opinion.
he
was
joined
by
a
member
rogers
in
that
opinion.
it
was
three
to
two
indicating
which
is
very
close
and
then
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
--
or
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
enforcement.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
order
should
be
enforced
and
on
petition
which
we
filed
here,
this
court
has
accepted
the
petition
of
the
american
ship
building
company
to
hear
the
case
on
a
limited
bases
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
single
employer
lockout
is
the
corollary
of
a
strike
under
the
taft-hart
--
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
no
sir.
in
--
in
december
1960,
the
american
ship
building
company
knowing
the
depressed
condition
under
which
the
industry
on
the
great
lakes
had
operated
and
knowing
that
they
were
a
seasonal
operation
because
the
great
lakes
are
frozen
over
from
november
through
to
april
decided
that
they
would
like
to
have
the
new
contract
which
expired
on
july
31,
the
old
contract.
they
just
like
to
have
that
renewed
with
the
least
disturbance
that
would
be
possible.
so
they
had
a
meeting
in
december
and
suggested
this
to
the
unit
organization
which
was
they
--
there
are
eight
craft
unions
here
and
the
boilermakers
local
no.
374
in
chicago
is
the
one
that
referred
the
charges.
subsequently,
the
parties
in
may
1961
exchanged
proposal
for
the
new
contract.
and
on
june
6,
1961,
the
first
meeting
of
the
parties
was
held.
at
that
meeting
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
july
31,
1961.
at
that
meeting,
the
negotiator
for
the
american
ship
building
company
called
attention
to
the
depressed
condition
of
the
industry
in
the
great
lakes
and
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
company
was
paying
as
much
as
42
cents
an
hour
more
than
its
competitors.
in
addition,
the
union
negotiator
stated
that
he
didn't
want
a
strike.
well
both
then
said
they
didn't
want
a
strike.
subsequent
negotiations
took
place
beginning
--
well
all
through
june
and
then
on
july
6
the
company
suggested
that
the
federal
mediations
service
to
be
called
into
the
dispute
and
a
conciliator
was
brought
into
the
dispute
of
that
day.
on
july
31,
agreement
still
had
not
been
reached.
and
the
company
had
been
asked
if
they
would
agree
to
a
six
months
extension
of
the
contract
or
to
an
indefinite
extension
of
the
contract.
the
company
would
not
agree
to
that
because
they
thought
with
the
validity
i
think
that
that
would
enable
stalling
on
the
part
of
the
negotiating
unions
to
bring
about
a
strike
during
their
busy
season
when
they
would
be
most
vulnerable
to
a
strike
effort
by
the
union.
but
they
did
agree
to
carry
on
while
the
union
took
a
vote
on
their
last
proposal.
they
also
suggested,
and
this
is
not
mentioned
in
the
facts
of
the
respondent's
brief,
but
they
also
offered
the
union
a
one
year
extension
of
the
existing
contract.
that
i
believe
is
at
page
177
or
178
of
the
record.
in
any
event,
the
conciliator
was
sufficiently
worried
about
precipitous
strike
action
to
ask
that
a
communication
be
transmitted
to
a
high
official
of
the
union
in
washington
to
ask
that
no
precipitous
strike
action
be
taken
by
the
union.
as
a
result,
and
i
believe
that
is
at
page
267
of
the
record,
as
a
result
on
august
the
2nd,
this
union
official
sent
a
telegram
in
which
he
assured
that
there
would
be
no
precipitous
strike
action
until
he
had
it
arrived
in
cleveland
where
the
negotiation
was
taking
place
on
august
7.
he
did
arrive
on
august
2nd,
further
meetings
were
held
on
august
8th
and
9th
and
on
august
the
10th,
no
agreement
having
been
reached,
the
union
had
refused
to
take
back
to
its
members
for
a
vote,
the
last
proposal
made
by
the
american
ship
building
company.
in
view
of
all
of
those
facts
and
an
impasse
having
been
reached
in
the
bargaining,
the
company
officials
met
on
august
10
and
decided
that
the
only
strategy
that
was
available
to
them
would
be
a
layoff.
so
notices
were
passed
out
and
on
the
morning
of
august
the
11th,
this
layoff
took
place
in
the
chicago
shipyard.
now,
it
is
important
to
note
and
i
typically
call
this
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
record
of
bargaining
in
this
situation
was
quite
unusual.
this
company
during
the
previous
ten
years,
beginning
in
1962,
had
been
faced
with
a
strike
and
there
had
been
a
strike
on
each
occasion
that
the
contract
expired.
in
1952,
in
1953,
in
1955,
in
1956,
in
1958,
five
strikes
with
five
contracts.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
was
going
to
get
to
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
quite
significant,
it's
not
in
the
record
but
i'd
like
to
mention
if
i
could.
and
then,
in
addition,
if
i
may,
there
were
two
walkout
strikes
in
february
1961
in
buffalo
and
chicago.
and
in
1955
if
the
court
pleases
a
large
--
a
very
large
vessel
was
held
in
the
shipyard
during
the
strike
because
of
a
slow
down
which
did
not
allow
these
repairs
to
be
completed
prior
to
this
--
to
the
layoff
--
to
the
strike.
now,
they
were
the
conditions
under
which
this
company
was
offering.
they
were
the
conditions
it
was
faced
with
when
this
impasse
was
reached
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
trial
examiner
found
that
this
lockout
was
justified.
he
found
that
there
was
legitimate
fear
of
a
strike
and
the
board
refused
by
three
to
two
decisions
to
agree
with
them
on
that
point.
now,
the
taft-hartley
act
of
course
was
enacted
to
equalize
the
bargaining
relationship
between
unions
and
employer.
prior
to
the
wagner
act,
the
union
side
had
been
without
proper
protection.
so
the
wagner
act
came
along
in
1935
and
did
give
in
section
7
and
other
sections
did
give
protections
to
the
unions
in
their
striking
and
concerted
activities.
then
in
1947
in
view
of
the
public
mood,
changes
were
made
to
more
nearly
equalize
the
bargaining
relationship
between
the
parties.
and
i
might
mention
that
in
the
wagner
act,
there
was
no
prohibition
of
a
lockout,
that's
pretty
clear.
when
the
taft-hartley
act
came
along,
there
is
still
no
prohibition
of
the
lockout
except
within
the
60-day
period
as
mentioned
in
section
8
(b)
(4),
the
notice
period
which
says
during
that
period
there
should
be
no
strike
or
lockout.
but
in
taft-hartley,
the
strike
and
the
lockout
are
coupled
in
four
sections.
and
this
court
in
what
i
termed
the
truck
drivers
case
which
was
really
a
decision
of
this
court
in
the
buffalo
linen
case,
this
court
in
that
case
with
mr.
justice
brennan
speaking
said
that
the
mention
of
the
strike
and
lockout
in
the
same
context
there
in
those
four
sections
constituted
a
recognition.
in
the
taft-hartley
act
that
lockouts
were
not
in
effect
completely
barred
and
they
were
not
illegal
per
se.
that
we
certainly
agree
with
and
we
rely
to
a
considerable
degree
on
this
truck
drivers
local
case.
in
that
case
which
i
believe,
i
can't
remember
but
i
believe
it
was
six
or
seven
or
eight
to
--
nothing
i'm
not
sure
of
that
number.
but
i
know
it
was
pretty
nearly
unanimous.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
also
said
that
the
protections
provided
by
section
7
and
13
of
the
act
for
union
activities
they
are
not
so
absolute
as
to
deny
self
help
to
employers
when
the
legitimate
interest
of
employers
and
employees
collide,
that
gentlemen
is
the
situation
here.
they
have
collided.
and
we
contend
that
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
american
ship
building
company
need
to
be
protected
by
this
--
needed
to
be
protected
by
this
layoff
which
took
place
on
august
11.
and
i
might
say
in
answer
to
the
earlier
question
of
justice
goldberg
that
according
to
information
that
i
have,
there
has
been
the
best
relationship
between
the
unions
and
the
company
subsequent
to
this
layoff
which
ended
on
october
27,
1961.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
been
told
that
the
relationship
is
now
so
good
that
instead
of
having
five
strikes
in
ten
years
that
there's
just
peace,
peace
between
the
two
different
--
different
bargaining
parties
and
that
i
think
is
very
wonderful.
but
getting
back
to
this
situation
here,
the
truck
drivers
local
case
not
only
took
the
position
that
lockouts
were
not
barred
but
they
took
a
further
position
that
the
position
of
the
board
legitimatizing
an
economic
lockout
was
not
a
full
extent
of
the
power
of
the
act
to
permit
lockout.
in
other
words,
they
indicated
or
at
least
we
think
the
court
indicated
that
there
were
other
lockouts
that
were
permissible
other
than
the
economic
lockout
and
of
course
in
that
case,
the
multiemployer
lockout
was
permitted
to
protect
the
employer
against
whipsaw
union
tactics.
now
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
well,
mr.
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
have
an
argument
i
want
to
make
on
--
on
this
case
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
--
which
i'd
like
to
get
in
that
for
just
one
minute,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
in
any
--
in
any
event,
the
board
if
i
may
get
back
to
this
economic
lockout
business,
the
national
labor
relations
board,
we
think,
without
authorization
from
the
statute
and
without
real
validity
has
attempted
to
characterized
lockouts
by
terminology
which
we
in
effect
thinks
--
think
takes
away
from
the
employer
legitimate
right
that
she
is
entitled
to
under
this
act.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
would
say
so,
yes.
i
would
like
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
am
making
and
i
was
going
to
get
that.
our
position
fundamentally
and
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
after
i
talk
about
the
insurance
agents'
case.
our
position
fundamentally
is
that
in
collective
bargaining,
the
board
has
gone
beyond
the
scope
of
the
powers
granted
to
it
by
the
congress.
we
rely
on
the
insurance
agents'
case
in
that
connection.
on
the
language
of
the
insurance
agents
case
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
suggest
there's
no
legal
bar
to
a
lockout
taking
place.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
lockouts,
generally.
i
can't
because
it
has
been
raised
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i'm
asking
you
to
do
that
all
--
all
to
find
that
this
particular
lockout
as
you
said
under
circumstances
here
is
legitimate
mr.
william
s.
tyson
yes
sir.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
yes,
that
is
correct.
however,
in
that
context,
i
think
the
alternative
answers
are
permitted.
and
we
think,
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated,
that
actually
the
lockout
is
legitimate
irrespective
but
we
say
that
in
the
context
of
the
facts
here,
we
say
that
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
which
is
the
limited
question
here
that
this
particular
lockout
is
legitimate
because
it
meets
the
test
which
we
think
and
are
arguing
to
you
are
necessary
to
legitimatize
a
lockout.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
yes.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
on
--
on
the
economic
phase
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
--
economic
laws.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
don't
think
so
--
i
don't
think
i'm
confined
as
you,
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
saying.
i
think
that
you
can
--
that
this
court
can
find
that
lockouts
generally
as
mr.
justice
white
said
are
not
barred
by
the
taft-hartley
act
over
any
other
act.
but
if
you
don't
want
to
go
that
far,
i
would
say
that
the
insurance
agents'
case
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
all
of
the
factors
indicate
to
me
that
a
lockout
where
the
employer
goes
in
to
bargain
with
the
employee
that
he
is
not
stopped
from
using
economic
pressure
in
the
form
of
a
lockout.
and
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case
that
he
is
permitted
to
use
that
economic
pressure
under
section
8
(b)
(4).
now,
i
was
getting
earlier
to
the
situation
that
the
board
has
by
terminology
we
think
to
characterize
lockouts
in
an
unfair
way.
they
called
them,
mr.
justice
goldberg
the
economic
laws
of
lockout.
the
multiemployer
lockout
to
avoid
whipsaw
tactic
and
they
called
this
one
a
bargaining
lockout.
now,
we
don't
like
to
be
placed
in
that
pigeonhole
but
we
are
there
at
least
they
say
we're
there
and
we
think
that
a
bargaining
lockout
is
permissible
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
we
think
that
an
employer
when
he
goes
to
the
bargaining
table
is
not
confined
to
defensive
tactics
while
the
union
is
able
to
engage
in
offensive
tactics
all
the
time.
we
don't
think
that's
fair.
we
don't
think
that
taft-hartley
act
meant
to
put
that
onus
on
an
employer
as
a
bargaining
table.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
yes.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
no,
i
didn't
say
that
sir.
i
didn't
say
that.
i
think
that
when
an
impasse
is
reached,
he
is
enabled
offensively
as
well
as
the
defensively
to
use
the
lockout
as
an
economic
pressure.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
believe,
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
i
would
without
probably
any
legal
reasons
but
just
because
of
the
mechanics
of
this
thing,
i
think
i
would
say
that
our
position
is
after
an
impasse.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
our
argument
here.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
now
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
well
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
--
i
can't
recall,
i
know
that
this
is
a
characterization
in
the
board's
brief
of
the
defensive
multiemployer
lock
--
lockout.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
insurance
agents.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
oh
no!
i
don't
think
it
had.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
am
so
thoroughly
relying
on
the
language
of
those
cases
which
--
in
which
you
wrote
the
opinion
and
i
may
not
be
correct
in
exactly
what
you
meant
there
but
i
am
relying
i
believe
on
the
views
expressed
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
on
--
on
this
impasse
question.
in
the
morand
brothers
case
and
in
those
other
cases
as
the
court
will
recall,
there
was
always
an
impasse
and
i
think
that
my
reasons
for
reaching
that
conclusion
based
on
the
logic
we
might
say
or
the
court,
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
other
circuits.
mr.
william
s.
tyson
that
was
an
impasse
here,
and
of
course
that
certainly
colors
my
thinking.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
again,
if
i
may,
that
this
characterization
for
the
board
of
these
lockouts
in
various
categories
is
not
realistic.
for
instance,
the
bargaining
lockout,
of
course,
is
to
advance
the
bargain
for
the
employer
to
try
to
get
him
as
good
an
employment
contract
as
his
passport.
well,
the
court
in
the
truck
drivers
local
case
at
page
96
in
speaking
of
the
multiemployer
lockout,
if
i
may
read
the
sentence,
it
says
conflict
may
arise
for
example
to
clean
the
right
strike
and
the
interest
of
the
small
employers
in
preserving
multiemployer
bargaining
as
a
means
of
bargaining
on
an
equal
basis
with
a
large
union
and
of
--
and
avoiding
the
competitive
disadvantage
resulting
from
non-uniform
contractual
term.
now,
our
point
in
reading
that
is
just
the
court
in
approving
this
multiemployer
lockout
recognized
that
the
protection
of
this
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
which
they
considered
so
important
by
the
small
employer
that
that
also
gave
the
employer
a
competitive
advantage
over
his
competitors
and
in
that
sense,
this
falls
within
the
economic
realm,
according
to
our
view,
and
therefore,
this
court
we
hope
will
not
follow
the
board's
action
in
trying
to
make
all
of
these
lockouts
different
to
fit
their
theory
because
some
of
these
lockouts
that
they
call
economic
really
advance
the
bargaining
interest
of
the
employer.
take
the
alaska
businessmen
association.
in
that
case
it
brings
out
a
very
vividly
the
difficulty
of
the
position
urged
by
the
board.
in
that
case,
the
association
had
a
selective
strike,
the
multiemployer
bargaining
organization
that
are
like
at
a
selective
strike
and
there
was
a
lockout
at
certain
unstruck
employer
but
the
question
there
and
they
held
that
the
lockout
is
illegal,
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
they
had
advanced
their
bargain
as
well
as
having
preserved
the
bargaining
unit
and
they
held
that
illegal.
and
that
shows
you
the
difficulties
of
trying
to
separate
these
inseparable
questions.
and
for
that
reason,
if
the
court
pleases,
we
argue
very
strongly
that
this
nomenclature,
this
terminology
that
the
board
is
using
is
unauthorized,
unwarranted
and
defeats
the
legitimate
interest
of
an
employer.
i
believe
i
have
five
more
minutes?
mr.
william
s.
tyson
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
a
few
scattered
thoughts
that
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
court.
in
response
to
what
justice
clark
asked
a
moment
ago,
i
believe
there's
a
statement
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
the
bargaining
lockout
has
not
brought
to
where
many
questions
as
i
understand
or
there
hadn't
been
very
widespread.
i
would
like
to
say
that
our
opponents
here
particularly
in
the
amicus
briefs
have
not
come
forward
with
any
valid
proposal
which
would
solve
this
thing.
the
only
thing
they
come
forward
with
is
let's
repeal
all
the
cases
that
are
against
us.
they
want
this
--
they
come
in
and
asked
this
court
to
repeal
or
reverse
the
mackay
radio
case,
to
reverse
the
truck
drivers
case,
to
reverse
the
insurance
agents'
case,
and
as
i
read
the
briefs,
i
am
convinced
that
they
would
deny
self-help
to
employers
or
as
this
court
has
said,
“employers
are
entitled
to
under
the
taft-hartley
act.”
mr.
william
s.
tyson
i
am
very
pleased
that
you
asked
that
question
if
your
honor
please
because
i
had
failed
to
make
clear
that
i
am
in
thorough
agreement
with
what
this
court
said
in
the
truck
drivers
case
that
the
rights
protected
under
section
7
for
the
employees
that
an
invasion
of
those
rights
in
an
attempt
to
right
the
union
or
frustrate
organizational
levels
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
of
course,
as
you
know
justice
goldberg,
neither
side
is
forced
under
this
act
to
make
a
concession
and
we
get
to
that
question
that
you
asked
a
moment
ago
about
an
impasse
and
in
further
response
to
that,
in
considering
the
questions
that
were
asked
by
you
and
by
justice
brennan,
i
think
my
thinking
on
that
probably
was
heavily
weighted
because
of
the
situation
here
where
there
was
an
impasse.
and
i'm
convinced
that
from
a
legal
standpoint,
an
impasse
may
not
be
a
prerequisite.
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
you
could
be
--
you
could
be
that
that
--
mr.
william
s.
tyson
that's
possible.
i
would
like
to
say
that
section
13,
we
think,
does
not
confer
the
protection
against
the
strike
which
is
contented
by
the
respondent.
we
think
that
that
section
was
put
into
the
act
originally
in
the
wagner
act
to
make
it
clear
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
wagner
act
did
not
proscribe
or
prohibit
strikes.
in
other
words
i
was
trying
to
show
that
strikes
were
legal
after
wagner
act
and
i
don't
think
that
has
been
changed
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
protection
against
the
lockout.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
at
all.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
this
--
as
one
of
the
amicus
brief
said,
if
the
employer
did
not
have
the
right
to
make
replacements,
your
argument
might
be
a
valid
one.
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
replacement
question
is
one
that
seems
to
be
confused
here
because
the
right
to
make
replacements,
we
think,
is
a
paper
right.
where
would
you
find
qualified
replacements
for
the
highly
technical
jobs
that
are
in
most
industrial
plants
today
and
furthermore
who
would
have
the
nerve
to
disturb
industrial
peace
in
pittsburg
or
chicago
or
new
york
by
using
replacements,
so
we
think
that
is
not
a
valid
argument
and
we
also
think
that
the
use
of
the
lockout
is
not
going
to
disturb
industrial
peace
because
as
suggested
earlier,
we
are
convinced
that
no
employer
is
going
to
shut
down
his
plant
and
take
that
chance
without
valid
and
justifiable
reasons.
thank
you
very
much.
