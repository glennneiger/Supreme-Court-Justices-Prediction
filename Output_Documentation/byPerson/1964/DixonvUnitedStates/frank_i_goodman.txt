mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
despite
the
shortage
of
time
available
today,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
restating
very
briefly
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
partnership
of
which
the
petitioners
were
members,
in
1952
purchased
$43
million
worth
of
short-term
promissory
notes,
either
directly
from
the
obligor
corporations
or
through
brokers
--
through
dealers
and
agents.
these
notes
bore
no
stated
rate
of
interest,
but
in
each
case,
they
were
issued
at
discounts
ranging
from
two
and
three-eights
to
three
and
three-quarters
percent.
by
the
end
of
the
tax
year,
the
partnership
had
sold
20
of
these
33
notes
for
an
aggregate
gain
of
$500,000,
virtually
all
of
it
should
be
result
of
discounts
at
which
the
notes
were
originally
issued.
the
other
13
notes
remained
on
hand
unmatured.
the
commissioner
determined
that
the
excess
of
the
face
amount
of
the
notes
over
the
amount
money
for
which
they
were
purchased
represented
interest,
accruing
over
the
life
of
each
note,
both
those
that
were
sold
and
those
that
were
not
sold.
and
since
the
partnership
was
on
the
accrual
basis,
the
interest
accruing
on
each
of
the
notes
was
required
to
be
included
within
the
partnership's
taxable
income
for
the
year
and
therefore,
in
the
taxpayers
distributed
shares.
the
taxpayers
concede
that
this
treatment
would
have
been
entirely
appropriate
if
the
notes
that
had
provided
for
interest
in
so
many
words.
but
they
say,
that
because
the
interest
element
--
because
the
compensation
they
received
for
the
use
of
their
money
was
not
specifically
labeled
as
such,
but
was
simply
added
to
the
amount
which
the
borrower
agreed
to
pay
on
the
maturity
of
the
notes,
that
they
are
not
required
to
accrue
it
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
treat
it
as
capital
gain
upon
the
sale
of
the
notes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right
sir.
and
that
is
true
despite
the
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
the
cases
holding
it
to
be
true
dates
from
about
1954.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
before
that
time,
i
think
that
there
was
a
considerable
degree
of
confusion
on
this
subject.
there
is
no
case
one
way
or
the
other
specifically
indicating
the
view
prior
to
1954.
we
think
this
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
of
course
we
don't
know
what
the
commissioner's
acquiescence
covered
except
a
particular
case
that
was
before
the
court.
that
was
a
non-interest
bearing
security
which
was
issued
at
a
discount
for
all
practical
purposes.
our
contention
on
that
subject
is
that
the
case
in
which
the
commissioner
acquiesced
doesn't
even
apply
to
this
case
for
a
somewhat
different
reason
that
mr.
justice
white,
you
talked
--
you
get
into
those
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
essentially
that's
right.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
that's
our
position
on
the
caulkins
case.
we
think
the
petitioners
that
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
caulkins,
that's
the
name
of
it.
we
think
that
the
petitioner's
contention
is
wholly
formalistic
and
that
it
becomes
all
the
more
extraordinary
when
one
further
fact
is
noted
which
was
not
adverted
to
by
mr.
brandes.
the
record
shows
that
as
each
of
these
notes
was
purchased,
it
was
immediately
pledged
as
security
for
a
bank
loan
in
an
amount
exactly
equal
to
the
face
amount
of
the
note.
now,
that
indicates
i
think
fairly
clearly
that
the
partnership
obtained
the
$43
million
with
which
to
purchase
these
notes
by
borrowing
it
from
a
bank
specifically
for
the
purpose.
in
1952,
it
paid
interest
on
the
money
which
it
borrowed
in
the
amount
of
$625,000
and
claimed
that
amount
as
an
ordinary
deduction
on
its
income
tax
return.
at
the
same
time,
the
profit
which
it
realized
on
the
notes
which
it
sold
amounted
to
only
$495,000.
so
the
tax
consequences
aside
the
net
effect
of
the
borrowing
and
lending
transactions
was
an
economic
loss
of
$130,000.
now,
the
explanation
for
this
seeming
folly
lies
of
course
in
the
tax
consequences.
assuming
that
the
partners
were
in
the
60%
bracket
which
seems
a
reasonable
assumption,
the
net
effect
of
their
obtaining
ordinary
interest
--
ordinary
deduction
on
the
interest
which
they
pay
while
obtaining
capital
gain
on
the
interest
which
they
received
is
to
reduce
their
overall
tax
bill
by
$250,000,
thus
not
only
completely
wiping
out
the
economic
loss
which
they
incurred
before
taxes,
but
giving
them
a
fairly
handsome
after-tax
profit
to
boot.
and
indeed
so
long
as
the
taxpayers
are
in
the
40%
bracket
or
higher,
they
stand
to
gain
on
this
arrangement.
to
us,
this
is
merely
another
illustration
of
the
fact
that
unless
the
tax
law
conforms
to
the
economic
realities
of
a
transaction,
gimmicks
and
devices
will
readily
be
found
to
exploit
the
artificiality
and
to
obtain
advantages
which
the
congress
never
dreamed
of
giving.
our
position
could
be
illustrated
by
a
simple
analogy,
a
disarming
analogy
as
mr.
brandes
has
referred
to
it
without
saying
in
anyway
why
it
isn't
completely
applicable
to
this
case.
if
a
gives
b
--
a
lends
b
a
$100
in
return
for
b's
promise
to
repay
the
$100
a
year
later,
plus
$6
extra,
this
obligation
can
be
worded
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
the
note
could
say
a
$100
plus
6%
interest.
it
could
say
a
$100
plus
6%,
a
$100
plus
$6
interest,
or
$100
plus
$6
or
as
in
the
present
case,
the
note
could
simply
say
a
$106.
now,
every
one
of
these
forms
of
expression
obviously
means
exactly
the
same
thing
and
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
tax
consequences
of
each
of
these
transactions
should
be
exactly
the
same
whether
the
interest
is
specifically
labeled
as
such
and
whether
or
not
it
is
stated
as
a
percentage
of
the
amount
borrowed
or
as
an
amount
added
to
what
the
borrower
agrees
to
repay
on
maturity.
in
each
case,
the
$6
increment
represents
exactly
the
same
thing
economically
and
that
is
compensation
paid
by
the
borrower
to
the
lender
in
exchange
for
the
use
of
the
lender's
money.
in
short,
interest
as
this
court
has
defined
it
in
deputy
versus
du
pont.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
note
with
the
stated
interest
of
6%,
everyone
agrees
that
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
has
to
accrue
the
$6
increment
ratably
over
the
term
of
the
note.
we
say
that
precisely
the
same
should
be
true
in
the
case
of
the
non-interest
bearing
note
promising
a
$106
at
maturity.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
broke
off
yesterday,
i
had
just
offered
an
analogy
which
in
our
view
aptly
illustrates
the
basic
principle
of
this
case.
i
suggested
that
if
a
lends
b
$100
today,
in
return
for
b's
promise
to
repay
the
$100
plus
$6
extra
one
year
from
today,
b's
obligation
could
be
expressed
in
the
note
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
all
of
which
mean
exactly
the
same
thing.
the
note
could
say
$100
plus
6%
interest
or
$100
plus
6%
or
$100
plus
$6
or
as
in
the
present
case,
the
note
could
simply
say
$106.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
$6
increment
simply
represents
the
compensation
which
the
borrower
agrees
to
pay
the
lender
in
return
for
the
lender's
money,
in
short,
interest
as
this
court
has
defined
it.
everyone
agrees
that
in
the
case
of
the
note
with
6%
stated
interest
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
would
be
required
to
accrue
the
$6
increment
over
the
life
of
the
note
and
we
say
exactly
the
same
result
should
obtain
in
the
case
of
$106
note
issued
at
a
$6
discount.
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
of
course
would
not
be
required
to
account
for
the
gain
until
he
sold
or
redeemed
the
note.
at
that
time,
he
would
be
deemed
to
be
selling
two
things;
first,
the
note
itself
carrying
with
it
the
right
to
interest
accruing
in
the
future,
and
secondly,
the
right
to
the
interest
that
had
already
been
earned
up
to
the
date
of
the
sale
or
redemption.
part
of
the
purchase
price
would
have
to
be
allocated
to
the
note
and
the
rest
of
it
would
have
to
be
allocated
to
the
interest
component
and
that
part
allocated
to
the
interest
component
would
be
taxable
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
well,
if
--
let's
suppose
first
that
nothing
happens
and
he
sells
the
note
at
the
end
of
six
months
for
$103.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
in
that
case,
there
would
be
no
capital
gain
or
loss
and
there
would
be
interest
income
of
$3.
if
the
market
rate
of
interest
increased
we'll
say,
so
that
he
was
able
to
sell
the
note
only
for
$102,
the
result
in
that
case
roughly
speaking,
not
quite
exactly,
but
roughly
speaking,
would
be
a
$1
capital
loss
and
$3
of
interest
income.
it
wouldn't
be
exactly
that
because
the
$102
would
have
to
be
--
well
100,
one
hundred
and
thirds
of
that
would
have
to
be
allocated
to
the
note
and
three
one
hundred
and
thirds
to
the
interest
element
and
would
come
out
that
he
had
perhaps
received
about
$2.97
of
interest
and
slightly
less
than
$100
would
be
attributable
to
the
note
in
that
case.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right,
the
54
statute
applies
only
to
securities
issued
by
a
corporation
or
by
a
governmental
entity.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i
think
for
the
most
part
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
1954
statute
was
intended
primarily
as
a
legislative
overruling
of
the
caulkins
case.
they
primarily
were
thinking
within
the
general
framework
of
that
decision
and
simply
didn't
provide
a
legislative
solution
which
went
to
the
heart
of
the
principle.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
don't
think
so.
i
maybe
wrong
about
that.
i
don't
think
they
did.
the
taxpayer
concedes
all
of
this
in
the
case
of
the
note
with
stated
interest
and
we
say
that
exactly
the
same
principle
should
apply
in
the
case
of
the
discounted
note.
this
conclusion
is
compelled
not
only
by
reason,
it
is
supported
also
by
the
overwhelming
weight
of
authority.
since
1959,
the
basic
issue
involved
in
this
case
has
come
before
six
courts
of
appeals,
the
court
of
claims
and
the
tax
court.
only
one
court,
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
midland-ross
case
has
resolved
the
matter
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
all
of
the
others,
the
first,
second,
third,
fifth
and
ninth
circuits
have
recognized
that
original
issue
discount
is
exactly
the
same
thing
as
interest
and
should
be
taxed
as
such.
the
conclusion
is
further
supported
by
the
long-standing
rule
as
to
the
treatment
of
original
issue
discount
from
the
standpoint
of
the
borrower,
that
is
to
say,
the
corporation
which
issues
the
security.
the
decisions
of
this
and
other
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
this
--
that
the
excess
of
the
amount
which
the
borrower
agrees
to
pay
upon
maturity
over
the
amount
at
which
the
security
is
issued,
represents
a
cost
of
obtaining
the
lender's
money
and
as
such
must
be
amortized
over
the
life
of
the
note
and
deductible
from
ordinary
income.
it
is
true
that
at
least
one
court
of
appeals,
the
second
circuit
has
thought
it
more
appropriate
to
regard
this
deductible
item
as
a
cost
sustained
by
the
issuing
corporation
rather
than
its
interest.
the
ninth
circuit
has
regarded
it
alternatively,
either
as
interest
or
as
a
cost.
but
three
other
courts
of
appeals,
the
third,
the
fourth
and
the
d.c.
circuit
have
concluded
unequivocally
that
original
issue
discount
is
deductible
as
an
interest
expense
by
the
issuing
corporation.
at
page
15
of
our
brief
in
the
midland-ross
case,
we
cite
the
well-reasoned
opinions
of
judge
goodrich
for
the
third
circuit
and
judge
parker
for
the
fourth
circuit.
we
neglected
to
cite
the
third
case
which
is
helvering
versus
california-oregon
power
company,
75
f.2d
64,
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
same
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
of
this
aspect?
we
regard
it
as
an
interest
deduction.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
on
both
sides
--
as
an
interest
deduction
by
the
issuer
and
as
an
interest
income
to
the
lender.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i'm
not
quite
sure,
i
understand
what
that
means
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
you're
distinguishing
the
yield
from
the
nominal
rate
of
interest.
i
believe
that's
true.
i've
read
that
mr.
justice
goldberg.
in
regard
to
the
question
that
you
just
asked,
in
view
of
the
contention
by
midland-ross
that
the
government
has
taken
a
different
view
with
regard
to
the
status
of
original
issue
of
discount
to
the
borrower,
midland-ross
says
that
the
government
regards
this
as
a
loss
rather
than
as
interest.
it's
true
that
the
government
has
been
inconsistent
about
this
over
the
course
of
the
years
and
at
times
has
regarded
it
as
a
loss.
but
so
far
as
i
know,
the
most
recent
expression
is
contained
in
the
ruling
which
we
quote
on
page
36
of
the
midland-ross
brief
which
says
--
states
as
follows,
the
final
paragraph
from
the
footnote.
the
courts
have
considered
the
nature
of
discount
in
cases
involving
private
corporations
and
have
held
it
to
be
in
the
nature
of
differed
interest
which
maybe
amortized
for
income
tax
purposes
over
the
life
of
the
bonds
by
deducting
the
annual
proportion
thereof
from
the
issuing
corporations'
gross
income
each
year
as
accrued
interest.
the
leading
decision
of
--
oh,
i
was
going
to
present
one
further
citation
which
we
didn't
give
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
to
the
longview
hilton
hotel
company
case,
9
t.c.
180,
182
and
the
case
is
cited
therein,
which
i
think
expresses
the
view
of
most
of
the
cases
of
the
tax
court
to
the
effect
that
it
is
an
interest
deduction
to
the
borrower.
the
leading
decision
of
this
court,
helvering
versus
union
pacific
company
is
a
little
bit
ambivalent.
at
some
point,
the
court
appears
to
refer
to
the
original
issue
of
discount
item
as
a
loss.
but
it
also
states
that
discount
is
a
factor
“in
arriving
at
the
actual
amount
of
interest
paid
for
the
use
of
capital
procured
by
a
bond
issue.”
the
difference
between
the
capital
realized
by
the
issuer
and
par
value
which
is
to
be
paid
at
maturity,
must
be
added
to
the
aggregate
coupon
payments
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
total
interest
paid.
now
if
as
these
authorities
seem
to
indicate,
original
issue
discount
represents
interest
paid
or
accrued
by
the
borrower,
then
necessarily
it
represents
income,
it
represents
interest
received
or
accrued
by
the
lender.
petitioners
don't
really
dispute
the
fact
that
original
issue
discount
and
stated
interest
are
in
substance
one
and
the
same
thing.
they
argue
however,
that
the
government
is
estopped
to
deny
them
capital
gains
treatment
because
of
its
earlier
acquiescence
in
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
the
caulkins
case.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
premium
logically
should
be
treated
the
same
way
as
discount
and
vice
versa
and
also
that
prior
to
1942,
i
think
it
was
the
general
understanding
that
premium
was
not
to
be
regarded
as
an
item
which
ended
into
the
computation
of
interest
but
rather
as
a
capital
item
to
use
that
terminology.
however,
the
two
questions
have
historically
been
treated
as
separate
compartments,
altogether
apart
from
one
another
at
least
much
of
the
time.
in
1942,
congress
enacted
a
statute
dealing
expressly
with
the
problem
of
bond
premium
and
said
not
a
word
about
bond
discount.
in
1954,
it
enacted
a
statute
dealing
with
original
issue
discount
and
said
not
a
word
about
premium
and
in
some
respects,
the
two
statutory
solutions
are
not
parallel.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
house
committee
as
mr.
brandes
said
yesterday
stated
that
the
prior
law
was
that
the
discount
was
a
capital
item
and
was
not
interest.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that
was
--
we
think
that
was
an
erroneous
and
overly
broad
statement.
the
senate
on
the
--
the
senate
committee
on
the
other
hand,
took
a
different
view.
it
said
that
the
law
simply
was
not
clear
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
house
bill,
the
1944
legislation
having
originated
in
the
house
was
simply
to
clarify
the
preexisting
law
and
to
remove
all
uncertainties
and
doubts.
so
at
least
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
negative
implication
in
the
1954
legislation.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
i
think
that
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
under
the
19
--
if
the
first
--
if
the
original
holder
of
the
note
sells
it,
he
is
chargeable
with
that
part
of
the
discount
interest
which
it
accrued
up
to
the
date
of
the
sale.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
is
accountable
for
the
balance
of
the
interest
as
it
accrues
during
his
holding
period.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
the
statute
applies
to
original
issue
discount.
that
result
would
have
been
true
with
--
i
think
everyone
agrees
that,
that
result
would
have
been
--
would
have
obtained
in
the
cases
where
interest
was
stated.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no.
what
i
said
yesterday
was
this.
well,
the
question
you
ask
i
believe
is
what
treatment
would
have
been
accorded
to
the
sale
of
a
security
with
accrued
interest
where
the
purchase
price
was
not
specifically
allocated
between
the
two
components.
and
my
answer
was
that
the
earliest
case
on
this
so
far
as
i
know
is
the
fischer
case
decided
in
1954.
since
then,
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
which
have
confirmed
the
result
that
you
must
allocate
the
purchase
price
between
the
interest
and
principal
component.
prior
to
that
time,
there
was
no
specific
case
and
i
think
that
the
matter
was
inconsiderable,
valid
and
confusion.
that
was
not
the
result
of
any
statutory
change
in
1954.
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
premium.
not
only
has
congress
treated
premium
and
discount
differently,
but
this
court
has
also
tended
to
regard
them
as
separate
questions.
in
1932,
a
much
criticized
decision,
the
old
colony
case,
this
court
held
in
effect
that
premium
was
not
to
be
taken
into
account
in
computing
the
interest
deductions
for
the
issuer.
the
court
said
that
interest
meant
what
everybody
--
interest
meant
what
is
called
interest.
it
meant
the
nominal
interest
rate
and
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
the
court
called
the
esoteric
notion
of
effective
interest
dreamed
up
by
accountants.
two
years
later
though
in
1936
in
the
union
pacific
case
to
which
i've
already
referred,
the
court
said
that
original
issue
discount
as
distinct
from
premium
was
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
issuer's
interest
deductions
so
that
it
treated
premium
and
interest
differently
--
premium
and
discount
differently.
and
as
i've
already
indicated,
the
lower
federal
courts
have
fairly
consistently
though
not
entirely
consistently
treated
discount
as
an
interest
item
to
the
borrower
without
so
much
as
nod
to
the
old
colony
case
and
its
ruling
as
to
premium.
this
disparity
of
treatment
was
noted
by
no
less
than
observer
than
roswell
magill
who
stated
at
page
184,
i
think
it
was.
i
have
that
somewhere,
stated
at
page
184
of
his
well
known
book
on
tax
--
204
rather,
of
his
well
known
book
on
taxable
income
that
the
union
pacific
decision
with
regard
to
discount
is
“hardly
reconcilable
on
theories
of
accrual
accounting
with
the
prior
holding
as
to
bond
premium.”
so
while
i
don't
pretend
to
defend
a
differentiation
in
treatment
between
premium
and
discount.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
need
deter
from
reaching
the
sound
and
sensible
result
in
the
case
of
discount
merely
because
of
early
and
long
since
discredited
decisions
about
premium
which
in
any
event
were
superseded
by
statute
as
early
as
1942,
long
before
the
transactions
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
can't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
don't
think
i
can
deny
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
emphasize
your
word
wrongly
though,
in
the
case
of
old
colony
decision
which
all
of
the
accounting
commentators
have
roundly
criticized
even
while
it
still
had
a
lot
of
vitality
and
i
don't
think
it
has
much
anymore.
now
turning
to
the
caulkins'
decision
and
the
contention
that
the
government
is
estopped
by
virtue
of
its
acquiescence
in
that
case,
we
think
that,
that
contention
fails
for
two
reasons.
the
first
place,
because
the
government
is
not
bound
by
its
acquiescence
and
in
the
second
place,
because
in
any
event,
the
caulkins'
decision
does
not
rule
this
case.
it's
well
settled
i
think
that
acquiescence
in
an
erroneous
decision
does
not
preclude
the
government
from
correcting
its
mistake
and
collecting
a
tax
otherwise
due.
the
taxpayer
cannot
claim
surprise
in
this
regard
because
the
cumulative
bulletin,
every
cumulative
bulletin
says
on
its
very
front
page
that
the
rulings
contain
therein
and
that
includes
acquiescence
are
not
binding
but
are
simply
intended
as
guides
to
official
administrative
prudent,
administrative
thinking.
the
statute
expressly
gives
the
commissioner
discretion
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
any
ruling
maybe
applied
without
retroactive
effect.
the
taxpayer
says
that
in
this
case,
that
abuse
--
that
discretion
was
abused
because
the
commissioner
made
the
withdrawal
of
his
acquiescence
retroactive
with
respect
to
all
taxpayers
other
than
those
who
had
purchase
the
particular
type
of
security
involved
in
the
caulkins
case.
now
we
don't
say
that
the
differentiation
between
that
type
of
security
and
other
types
of
securities
was
altogether
a
reasonable
one,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
certainly
wasn't
arbitrary
and
invidious.
the
government
simply
made
a
limited
vow
in
the
direction
of
stare
decisis
much
as
this
court
did
when
it
held
that
football
and
boxing
were
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
but
refrained
from
extending
that
principle
to
baseball
which
was
the
particular
sport
which
had
been
covered
by
the
prior
decision
in
tulsan
exempting
it
from
the
antitrust
laws.
in
any
event,
the
caulkins
case
really
isn't
in
point
here.
the
caulkins
arose
under
a
particular
statute,
section
117f
of
the
1939
code
which
dealt
only
with
the
retirement
of
bonds
and
the
decision
was
very
much
based
upon
the
particular
language
of
that
statute.
in
caulkins,
the
taxpayer
purchased
for
about
$15,000
payable
in
ten
annual
installments,
an
installment
certificate
in
the
face
amount
of
$20,000
which
he
surrendered
for
that
amount.
that
represented
the
equivalent
of
a
5.5%
return
on
his
investment.
and
indeed,
the
5.5%
was
even
written
on
the
cover
of
the
certificate.
the
court
held
that
this
was
capital
gain
under
the
language
of
section
117f
which
provided
that
amounts
received
upon
the
retirement
of
corporate
bonds
would
be
considered
to
be
received
in
exchange
therefore.
the
court
didn't
base
its
decision
upon
any
broad,
general
principle
that
original
issue
discount
was
different
from
interest
or
had
traditionally
been
treated
differently.
in
fact,
specifically
agreed
with
the
government,
that
the
discount
was
essentially
the
same
as
interest
and
that
there
was
no
practical
reason
for
taxing
it
other
than
as
ordinary
income,
but
it
felt
compelled
by
the
particular
language
of
section
117f
to
hold
it
capital
gain.
i
think
it's
quite
probable
that
the
court
would
have
reached
the
same
result
in
the
case
of
a
note
with
stated
interest
and
it
might
well
have
reached
a
different
result
had
the
discounts
been
realized
upon
a
transaction
not
covered
by
section
117f,
in
other
words,
by
a
sale.
now
this
interpretation
of
the
caulkins'
decision
is
by
no
means
a
novel
one.
even
before
the
government
withdrew
its
acquiescence
in
caulkins,
the
tax
court
held
that
the
rule
of
caulkins
was
confined
to
retirements
and
did
not
apply
to
sale
and
i'd
like
to
read
the
court
exactly
what
the
tax
court
said
in
that
regard.
it
said
in
the
paine
case
23
t.c.
391
and
401,
we
think
it
clear
that
the
decision
in
the
caulkins
case
was
based
solely
upon
the
precise
language
of
section
117f
which
left
no
doubt
that
the
entire
amount
received
as
a
result
of
the
retirement
of
notes
and
registered
form
was
to
be
deemed
received
in
exchange
for
such
notes
despite
the
recognition
of
both
courts,
both
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
--
and
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
increment
there
under
consideration
was
essentially
interest.
it
is
obvious
however
that
section
117f
is
not
here
applicable
because
there
was
no
retirement
of
the
notes
but
only
a
sale
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
notes
were
in
registered
form.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
was
reversed
on
grounds
which
are
completely
irrelevant
to
this
consideration.
it
was
reversed
essentially
on
the
ground
that
in
that
case,
the
notes
in
question
had
been
given
in
return
for
property.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no.
they
concluded
that
there
was
no
interest
element
at
all
in
the
case
because
they
didn't
know
what
the
value
of
the
property
was.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
premium
is
governed
by
a
different
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1942.
in
general,
the
treatment
is
similar.
the
treatment
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
yes,
i
suppose
it
was.
the
difference
in
treatment
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
they're
very
similar.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
they're
entirely
different.
on
the
contrary,
they're
almost
the
same,
but
only
almost
the
same.
for
example,
the
statute
dealing
with
premium
deals
with
both
market
premium
and
original
issue
premium,
the
distinction
i
haven't
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
the
statute
provides
that
it
--
the
statute
gives
the
lender
an
election
to
either
to
amortize
it
over
the
life
of
--
amortize
it
as
a
deduction
over
the
life
of
the
security
or
to
treat
it
as
a
loss
in
the
year
of
sale
or
redemption,
it
has
that
choice.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
statute
doesn't
deal
with
the
element
that
pays
it.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
he
is
required
to
amortize
it.
now
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
old
colony
case
said
that
you
don't
amortize
it
as
an
interest
deduction
but
it
left
open
the
possibility
at
least
after
1913
of
amortizing
it
as
income
received
by
the
issuer.
so
that
really,
it
is
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
we
argue
that
discount
should
be
treated,
but
i
have
to
concede
that
it
was
not
on
the
theory
that
it
was
an
interest
deduction.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i'd
like
to
correct
what
i
just
said.
i
was
a
little
bit
confused.
he
is
allowed
to
amortize
it
but
not
on
the
theory
that
it
is
an
offset
to
interest.
in
other
words,
if
a
bond
is
purchased
for
100
--
for
$94
and
it's
a
$100
bond
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
alright
if
it's
purchased
for
$100
and
it
has
a
face
amount
say
of
$94,
it's
purchased
at
a
premium.
the
$6
premium
that
is
received
by
the
issuer
is
required
to
be
amortized
as
income
by
the
issuer
over
the
term
of
the
security.
now
originally
in
the
old
colony
case,
the
government
argued
that
this
should
be
true
because
you
should
treat
the
$6
as
a
factor
which
enters
into
the
computation
of
his
interest
deduction
in
subsequent
years.
you
should
treat
it
as
an
offset
to
his
interest
deduction
in
subsequent
years
as
reducing
his
interest
deduction.
the
court
held
in
old
colony,
no
that
wasn't
the
proper
way
of
looking
at
interest,
but
it
did
leave
the
way
open
for
amortizing
it
nonetheless
and
this
would
have
the
same
effect.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
he
is
the
lender.
he
is
the
person
who
was
governed
by
the
statute
and
he
is
permitted
--
he
is
given
an
election
as
to
whether
to
amortize
it
or
as
to
whether
to
treat
it
as
a
loss
in
the
year
in
which
he
sells
the
bond
or
redeems
it.
that
was
the
statutory
solution
adopted
in
1942.
now
i
suppose
that
in
most
cases
he
would
be
--
he
would
choose
to
amortize
it
and
treat
it
as
an
ordinary
loss
so
that
the
election
aspect
of
the
statute
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no.
from
the
lender's
side,
it
is
a
deductible
item.
it
increases
his
interest
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way.
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
interest.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
increases
his
interest
deduction.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
now,
he
is
--
excuse
me.
i've
been
confusing
you
i'm
afraid.
excuse
me,
he
is
the
person
who
is
receiving
the
interest.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
he
is
the
recipient.
the
lender
is
the
recipient
of
interest.
he
has
no
interest
deduction.
the
lender
may
treat
this
$6
premium
which
he
has
had
to
pay
at
the
time
he
purchases
the
bond
as
a
deduction
amortized
over
the
life
of
the
asset.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that
is
right.
it
offsets
the
interest
which
he
received.
now
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
that's
the
theory
of
the
deduction.
it
simply
says
that
he
may
deduct
it.
now
it's
not
clear
whether
he
may
deduct
it
as
a
loss
or
as
an
offset
to
the
interest
which
he
received.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that
is
statutory
in
the
case
of
the
lender,
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct,
it
treated
--
it
changed
the
rule
of
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
case
which
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
almost
the
same,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
