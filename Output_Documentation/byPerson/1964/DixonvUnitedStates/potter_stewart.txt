these
were
the
notes,
promissory
notes?
justice
potter
stewart
purchased
from
the
obligor,
from
the
maker?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
date
of
issue
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
1952
and
then
these
sales
were
also
within
the
calendar
year
1953?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
the
only
--
that's
the
only
income
in
question
in
this
case,
is
it,
1952?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
accruals
experience
appropriate
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
not
–
i
probably
should
know
this,
but
i
don't
know
if
the
partnership
of
course
is
not
itself
a
tax
payer.--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
a
reporter
of
a
return
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
if
the
partnership
is
on
the
accrual
basis,
does
this
automatically
put
all
the
partners
on
the
accrual
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
not
such
as
the
business
--
as
to
that
part
of
the
income
account,
a
very
income
account
in
the
partnership
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they'd
be
on
a
cash
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
what
about
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
--
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
discount
is
deductible
to
the
issuer?
justice
potter
stewart
from
his
ordinary
income
whether
or
not
his
on
the
accrual
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
what
ever
his
basis
is?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
whether
it'd
be
cash
or
accrual?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
retirement
not
a
sale.
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
that
178
–
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
going
rate
of
interest
changed
between
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
note
and
the
sale
of
third
party
and
which
would
affect
the
price
because
of
the
going
of
the
change
and
the
going
rate
of
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
case
you've
already
given.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
a
good
deal
of
this
problem
has
been
explicitly
covered
in
the
1954
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
with
respect
to
the
note
of
an
individual
person
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
54
statute
does
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
get
to
that,
how
do
you
handle
the
consistent
treatment
of
premium
or
have
you
told
us
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
your
answer
--
your
explanation
does
indicate
that
plenty
of
--
there
are
plenty
of
examples
and
you've
given
us,
one
where
things
which
are
a
matter
of
economics
are
alive
have
because
of
the
labels
attributed
to
--
has
been
treated
differently
by
this
court
and
other
courts.
you've
just
told
us
about
premium
and
discount
and
the
same
might
well
be
true
about
discount
and
the
interest
even
though
economically,
these
things
are
all
in
a
parity,
still
the
labels
that
people
have
given
to
them
have
rightly
or
wrongly
influenced
the
courts
to
different
results
and
again
--
justice
potter
stewart
results
which
is
a
matter
of
economics
or
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
the
paine
case
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
didn't
get
to
this
ground
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
