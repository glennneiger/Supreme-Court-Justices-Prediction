mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
there
are
two
issues
involved
and
the
first
of
the
two
issues,
the
same
issue
is
involved
in
the
companion
case
of
the
midland-ross
corporation
in
which
the
government
is
the
petitioner.
that
case
follows
immediately
after
this
case.
so
far
as
the
first
issue
was
concerned,
the
facts
are
relatively
simple.
the
year
involved
is
the
year
1952
and
accordingly
the
provisions
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
apply.
in
that
year,
the
petitioner's
here
were
members
of
the
partnership
engaged
in
the
business
of
dealing
in
securities.
in
addition,
the
partnership
from
time
to
time
purchase
securities
for
its
own
account
as
principal.
in
early
nine
--
commencing
in
early
1952,
the
partnership
purchased
certain
securities
consisting
of
promissory
notes
that
had
been
issued
at
a
discount
and
did
not
bear
interest.
it
is
conceded
that
these
securities
were
properly
identified
and
marked
for
investment
as
is
required
of
a
deal
of
in
securities
so
that
they
constituted
in
the
hands
of
the
partnership,
capital
assets.
these
securities
were
sold
after
--
certain
of
these
notes
were
sold
in
1952
after
they
have
been
held
for
more
than
six
months.
and
the
gain
on
the
sale
was
reported
by
the
partnership
and
therefore
by
the
petitioners
as
a
long-term
capital
gain.
on
audit,
the
internal
revenue
service
held
that
the
gain
which
had
been
reported
on
sale
as
long-term
capital
gain
was
in
reality
interest
income
and
so
far
as
the
notes
which
as
of
the
end
of
the
year
had
not
yet
been
sold,
as
to
those
notes
even
though
they
had
not
yet
been
sold,
there
was
a
requirement
for
a
picking
up
on
a
pro
rata
basis
of
the
discount
at
which
those
notes
had
been
issued.
the
first
issue
is
therefore
a
very
narrow
confined
issue
with
statuary
construction
under
the
1939
code.
it
is
an
issue
that
does
not
exist
in
the
context
of
this
case
under
the
1954
code
because
as
we
propose
to
develop
the
law
that
has
been
changed.‚Äù
properly
stated
was,
the
issue
is
very
simple,
what
under
the
1939
code
was
the
status
of
issue
discount
and
to
what
is
the
answer
to
that
question
is
to
be
determined
only
in
the
light
of
the
words
of
the
statute
as
written,
in
the
light
of
a
demonstrated
intent
of
congress
and
in
the
light
of
such
precedent
as
we
have
on
the
issue
and
so
far
as
precedent
is
concerned,
the
only
precedent
close
to
this
issue
consists
of
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
in
the
court
below
and
continued
here,
the
respondent
has
offered
a
very
simple,
disarming
approach
to
the
issue.
the
respondent's
approach
basically
is,
discount
is
like
compensation
for
the
use
of
money.
interest
is
also
compensation
for
the
use
of
money.
accordingly,
discount
and
interest
must
be
related
and
the
measure
involved
of
compensation
for
the
use
of
money
must
be
the
measure
of
ordinary
taxable
income
in
the
nature
of
interest
that
must
exist.
now,
this
approach
which
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
terming
it
a
simple
and
disarmingly
simple
approach
was
fully
accepted
by
the
court
below
and
so
far
as
we
can
ascertain
from
the
opinion,
the
court
did
not
proceed
to
examine
what
it
is
that
we
there
offered
and
there
offered
again
by
way
of
material
that
shows
that
congress
was
aware,
that
obligations
were
issued
at
a
discount
and
was
aware
that
the
tax
treatment
which
attached
to
obligations
that
were
issued
at
a
discount
were
different.
further
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
in
some
instances
from
the
maker
and
in
other
instances
from
other
dealers.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
in
all
as
i
remember
about
one
instance
on
the
date
of
issue.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
these
sales
were
within
the
calendar
year
1952
as
to
certain
of
the
notes
which
were
thus
purchased.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
well,
in
1952
is
the
only
year
before
the
court.
however,
on
audit
of
1952,
the
internal
revenue
service
reclassified
the
gain
on
the
sale
of
the
notes
which
were
sold.
and
in
addition,
with
regard
to
the
unsold
notes
on
the
ground
that
the
discount
which
had
been
accumulating
on
those
unsold
notes,
was
ordinary
income
in
the
nature
of
interest
they
forced
in
accrual.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
these
are
accruals
--
the
partnership
is
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
right
sir.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
the
partnership
files
an
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
no
sir.
we
thought
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
the
individuals
are
not
on
the
accrual
basis,
but
they
must
pick
up
in
their
individual
returns,
what
it
is
that
the
partnership
return
shows
as
their
share
of
income
(voice
overlap).
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
even
though
they'd
be
on
the
cash
basis.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
the
partnership
return
is
just
an
information
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
--
that
discloses
what
it
is
that
each
of
the
partners
must
report.
returning
to
this
approach
based
on
compensation
for
the
use
of
money,
although
it
involves
the
anticipating
part
of
our
argument
here,
because
it
is
so
fundamental
to
our
position
to
point
out
and
to
have
the
court
realize
that
the
measure
of
compensation
for
the
use
of
money
is
not
the
measure
of
interest.
i
should
like
at
this
point
to
refer
the
court
to
its
decisions
in
the
bond
premium
cases.
just
as
that
obligation
is
issued
at
a
discount,
it
is
issued
at
a
premium.
this
court
has
upheld
the
treasury
in
holding
that
the
amount
of
premium
paid
does
not
reduce
the
amount
of
interest
yield
on
the
obligation,
unless
there
is
special
legislation.
in
other
words,
if
an
investor
holds
an
obligation
which
he
acquired
at
a
premium,
he
is
required
to
pick
up
and
report
the
full
amount
of
the
interest
yield
without
reduction
for
the
premium,
unless
there
is
special
legislation
which
authorizes
the
amortization
of
the
premium,
which
special
legislation
came
into
being
in
1942
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
yield
in
the
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
--
in
the
economic
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
--
or
the
investments.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
right
sir,
without
any
reduction.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
well,
or
--
if
you
use
the
terminology
of
yield,
then
all
the
interest
that
is
paid
to
him
is
not
the
yield.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
right.
turning
to
what
we
believe
that
we
are
in
a
position
to
prove
with
regard
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
connection
with
the
1939
code
as
in
support
of
our
position
that
under
the
1939
code,
unlike
under
the
1954
code,
issue
discount
is
a
capital
item.
we
should
like
to
refer
to
the
structure
of
the
statue
to
the
fact
that
there
were
specific
provisions
of
the
statue
which
should
have
been
superfluous.
if
the
rule
is
as
respondent
contends
namely,
if
the
rule
is
that
issue
discount
is
always
an
income
item.
we
also
--
to
demonstrate
the
state
of
the
lower
pride
to
the
1954
code
will
show
that
the
administrative
practice
existing
at
least
prior
to
1953
was
to
regard
issue
discount
as
a
capital
item.
the
capital
gains
and
losses
provisions
of
the
1939
code
are
very
clear.
they
define
capital
assets
and
they
further
define
that
any
gain
realized
on
the
sale
of
a
capital
asset
is
a
capital
gain
and
that
it
is
true,
is
as
far
as
they
go
and
there's
--
in
that
connection.
within
that
framework
if
we
went
no
further,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
find
why.
this
discount
when
realized
on
sale
should
not
be
a
capital
gain.
there
was
a
sale
and
there
was
a
profit
and
it
was
realized
after
six
months.
if
we
are
to
believe
that
there
are
some
hidden,
ipso
limitations
on
the
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
capital
gain,
it
is
most
material
to
observe
that
within
the
framework
of
section
117,
which
is
the
pertinent
section,
the
congress
has
inserted
a
very
explicit
exception.
securities
that
have
been
--
short-term
securities
that
have
been
issued
at
a
discount
and
without
interest,
the
statue
goes
on
to
say.
by
any
government,
do
not
constitute
capital
assets
by
excluding
them
from
the
definition.
congress
saw
to
it
that
any
gain
on
those
securities
was
ordinary
income.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
respondent
has
come
forward
with
some
explanation
of
the
background
of
that
section
of
the
statue.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
existence
of
this
section
of
the
statue
shows
that
the
congress
was
in
a
position
and
knew
how
to
deal
with
issue
discount
under
the
1939
code,
when
it
was
faced
with
the
need
so
to
deal
with
issue
discount
under
the
1939
code.
there
were
other
examples
as
specific
enactments
dealing
with
issue
discount
that
should
have
been
superfluous,
if
the
rule
under
the
1939
code
was
as
is
contended.
there
are
special
provisions
in
section
207(d)
and
207(e)
dealing
with
certain
insurance
companies
and
specifically
requiring
those
certain
insurance
companies
to
accrue
and
report
is
ordinary
income
discount
and
on
the
counter
balance
to
accrue
and
report
by
way
of
reduction
of
ordinary
income
on
premium.
going
back
into
the
legislative
history,
we
find
specific
statements
in
the
congress
wherein
they
displayed
their
understanding
and
awareness
of
the
fact
that
debt
obligations
were
issued
at
a
premium
under
the
discount
and
that
different
--
were
being
issued
with
expressed
interest
under
the
discount
and
that
different
tax
consequences
attached
to
the
different
types
of
obligations.
we
have
at
some
length
delved
upon
the
senate
debate
in
1929.
this
debate
was
occasioned
by
a
proposal
which
authorized
the
issue
of
treasury
bills
at
a
discount.
at
that
time,
interest
on
u.s.
obligations
was
exempt
from
the
tax.
it
was
recognized
that
to
make
the
treasury
bills
competitively
saleable,
there
had
to
be
some
exemption
factor
attached
to
them.
the
proposal
of
the
treasury
and
accepted
by
the
senate
finance
committee
was
to
attach
the
exemption
factor
by
providing
in
the
statue
that
all
gain
on
the
sale
or
rather
disposition
of
these
bills
should
be
exempt
from
tax.
the
debate
in
the
senate
shows
that
there
was
considerable
opposition
to
such
a
proposal,
because
it
was
felt
that
there
should
not
be
any
weakening
of
the
structure
which
required
all
capital
gains
to
be
subject
to
tax.
the
debate
in
the
senate
further
shows
that
the
senate
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
discount
at
which
these
bills
were
being
issued
represented
to
use
the
words
of
senator
reid
‚Äúhire
for
the
use
of
money‚Äù
and
further
demonstrates
that
the
senate
believes
because
it
had
been
so
advised
by
the
treasury
that
under
then
existing
regulations
of
the
treasury,
discount,
issue
discount
when
realized
would
be
taxed
as
capital
gain.
and
accordingly,
the
exemption
for
interest
which
then
existed
pertaining
to
obligations
of
the
united
states
could
not
apply
to
a
treasury
bill.
the
congress
again
displayed
the
great
awareness
of
the
situation
by
carving
out
the
discount,
by
specifically
legislating
that
the
discount
shall
be
labeled
and
classified
as
interest.
and
in
that
way,
the
congress
permitted
to
be
attached
to
the
discount
at
which
these
bills
were
issued,
the
exemption
then
applying
for
interest.
in
1938,
there
was
a
subcommittee
appointed
as
a
part
of
the
study
leading
to
1939
code.
this
subcommittee
considered
whether
or
not
to
eliminate
the
capital
gains
tax.
because
time
is
running
out,
i
cannot
now
read
to
you
the
excerpt
from
this
committee's
report,
but
i
should
like
to
refer
you
honors
to
it.
it
is
on,
page
15
of
my
brief,
and
clearly
again
shows
that
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
practice
and
was
aware
of
the
different
tax
results
that
existed.
i
have
no
place
in
the
respondent's
paper
been
able
to
find
any
statement
by
respondent,
that
his
practice
was
other
than
during
this
period
prior
to
1953,
1952
and
prior,
other
than
to
treat
issue
discount
as
capital
gain.
we
have
in
our
papers,
references
to
the
acquiescence
which
stood
through
five
major
legislative
overhauls
in
a
case
which
held
that
issue
discount
when
realized
was
capital
gain.
at
the
very
beginnings
of
1952,
there
was
a
special
ruling
issued
in
publishing
the
tax
services,
which
again
repeated
respondent's
position
that
issue
discount
when
realized
was
taxable
as
a
capital
gain.
now,
it's
true
that
the
statue
was
changed
in
1954.
however,
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
structure
of
the
statue.
it
is
as
clearly
as
prospective
an
application
as
any
statue
could
be.
it
applies
only
to
obligations
issued
after
december
31,
1954,
and
that
although
the
statue
itself
was
passed
in
august
of
1954.
furthermore,
in
one
specific
instance,
in
section
1232,
where
they
wanted
to
change
the
existing
rules,
they
have
yet
another
effective
date
of
march
1954.
in
connection
with
the
enactment
of
the
1954
code,
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
clearly
stated
that
this
is
a
change
in
the
law
that
under
the
prior
law
issue
discount
was
taxed
when
realized
as
a
capital
item.
with
regard
--
i
have
mentioned
the
situation
with
regard
to
bond
premium
and
there
legislative
history
was
the
same.
the
situation
is
to
bond
premium
to
bring
up
more
in
line
with
concepts
of
finance
and
economics
was
corrected
in
1942.
the
respondent's
answer
here
apart
from
the
argument
to
which
i
have
referred
is
primarily
that
discount
is
deductible
to
the
issuer.
now,
i
can't
find
that
that
is
an
answer
to
the
problem
because
as
regards
premium,
premium
has
always
been
an
item
of
increase
to
the
issuers
income
even
at
the
time
when
it
was
not
an
item
of
decrease
to
the
holder's
income
with
regard
to
the
obligation.
in
summary
so
far
as
this
first
point
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
under
the
regulations
of
the
treasury,
it
must
be
amortized
over
the
life
of
the
security.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
right.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
right.
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
i
have
--
there
are
several
--
there
are
two
things
about
this
first
point
that
i'd
like
to
repeat
and
reiterate.
one
is,
i
think
the
government
should
come
forward
and
clearly
state
what
it
is,
what
its
position
with
regard
to
issue
discount
prior
to
1953
since
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
year
1952.
and
further
to
explain
why,
the
government
did
not
approach
congress
prior
to
1954
to
amend
the
statue.
is
the
government
not
now
in
the
position
where
it
is
coming
to
this
court
and
presenting
to
the
court
arguments
and
reasons
that
should
have
been
more
properly
presented
to
the
congress
and
which
were
not
presented
to
the
congress
until
1954.
the
second
point
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
a
matter
of
fundamental
importance
and
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
it
involves
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
taxpayers
are
privileged
to
rely
on
public
pronouncements
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
are
privileged
to
believe
that
if
those
pronouncements
are
changed
or
if
the
position
set
forth
therein
is
changed,
they
will
be
changed
on
the
basis
that
does
not
discriminate
as
between
taxpayers
or
as
among
the
taxpayers.
the
partnership
here
purchased
the
securities
at
a
time
when
it
fully
believed,
because
of
the
preexisting
government
practice
that
had
been
announced
in
more
than
one
place
and
particularly
announced
in
the
acquiescence
in
the
fulton's
case,
that
issue
of
discount
when
realized
would
bring
about
capital
gain.
the
government
withdrew
the
caulkins
acquiescence
in
1955.
at
the
time
when
the
caulkins
acquiescence
was
withdrawn,
the
government
stated
that
it
could
not
and
there
was
no
basis
to
distinguish
the
discount
element
present
in
any
security
from
the
discount
element
present
in
any
other
security.
in
addition,
although
the
caulkins
acquiescence
which
was
a
--
well,
let
me
say
this
about
acquiescence,
that
all
of
the
things
that
the
treasury
may
say
‚Äúthe
most
significant
on
this
side
of
the
table
is
the
acquiescence.‚Äù
this
is
what
the
practitioner
and
the
businessman
go
high.
when
the
caulkins
acquiescence
was
withdrawn,
the
government
withdrew
it
not
only
retroactively
without
warning,
but
withdrew
it
on
a
basis
that
discriminated.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
no
sir.
i
ask
you
to
follow
automobile
club
of
michigan.
in
that
case
if
you
will
remember
sir,
the
automobile
clubs'
exempt
status
was
revoked
in
1945
and
carried
back
to
1943.
the
automobile
club
said
that
the
commissioner
should
not
be
permitted
retroactively
to
change
his
position.
this
court
held
that
the
commissioner
is
privileged
to
change
his
position
to
correct
the
mistake
of
law,
but
whether
he
has
acted
properly
always
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
and
in
the
discussion
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
there
are
two
aspects
that
are
emphasized.
one
is
that
the
carry
back
to
1943
gave
the
automobile
club
no
cause
for
complaint,
because
in
1943
it
had
already
been
placed
on
notice
by
a
publicly
issued
general
counsel's
memorandum
that
clubs
such
as
it
would
no
longer
be
exempt
from
tax.
and
most
importantly,
when
the
internal
revenue
service
changed
its
position,
it
was
uniformly
applied
clear
across
the
boards
to
every
taxpayer
similarly
situated.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
retroactive
application
without
warning
and
we
have
a
discriminatory
application,
because
the
withdrawal
of
the
caulkins
acquiescence
is
not
applied
as
against
particular
taxpayers
who
purchased
a
particular
kind
of
security.
even
though
at
the
same
time,
the
internal
revenue
service
admitted
that
there
was
no
basis
on
which
to
distinguish
one
discount
security
from
any
other
discount
security.
if
i
may
sir,
i
should
like
to
save
the
remaining
time.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
mr.
goodman
yesterday
afternoon
in
his
statement
of
the
facts,
inadvertently
but
yet
very
peculiarly
significant
reason,
i
am
afraid
misdescribed
the
facts.
mr.
goodman's
mistake
was
that
he
stated
that
in
the
transactions
here
involved,
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
was
an
economic
loss
of
consequence.
the
fact
is
however
that
there
was
an
economic
gain
of
substance.
this
was
examined
by
the
treasury
department
on
audit
and
they
were
satisfied.
and
that
is
why
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
economic
gain
in
this
transaction
was
not
raised
in
either
in
the
lower
courts
or
raised
until
yesterday
--
or
stated
until
yesterday
afternoon.
now
the
reason
why
mr.
goodman
made
that
mistake
is
that
he
compared
the
gain
on
the
sales
of
the
securities
made
in
1952
with
the
interest
course
of
carrying
the
entire
position
including
those
securities
which
were
first
sold
in
1953.
the
significance
of
the
mistake
is
that
it
emphasizes
the
difference
between
an
investment
including
a
discount
obligation
and
stated
interest.
you
don't
know
the
results
on
an
investment
until
the
investment
is
fully
disposed
of.
it
is
only
then
that
the
economic
consequences
are
in
hand.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
if
all
things
work
out
as
you
hope
they
will.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
if
the
lender
can
pay.
if
the
lender
remains
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
of
course,
the
lender
--
that
the
borrower
remains
solvent
and
able
to
meet
his
obligation.
now,
strangely
and
interestingly
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
no,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
it
is
conceded
that
they
were
sold
and
in
bona
fide
sales.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
a
period
of
time
that
probably
differed
as
between
various
obligations
maybe
somewhat
so
closer
to
maturity
and
others
were
so
--
at
a
period
of
time
further
removed
from
the
maturity.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
if
they
had
been
held
to
maturity
under
the
statute
as
it
existed
prior
of
1954,
the
gain
would
have
been
ordinary
income
because
these
obligations
were
not
in
registered
form
or
with
coupons
attached
and
the
significance
given
in
the
statute
on
a
retirement
was
limited
to
obligations
in
registered
form
or
with
coupons
attached.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
the
borrowers
were
solvent.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
they
were
sold
and
there
is
no
--
as
i
mentioned,
no
argument
made
about
the
sale.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
the
gain
would
not
have
been
a
capital
gain
because
the
threshold
item
of
a
sale
or
exchange
would
be
missing.
117f
which
makes
a
retirement,
a
deemed
exchange
was
then
limited
to
obligations
and
registered
form
or
with
coupons
attached.
that
requirement
was
eliminated
in
the
1954
code.
now,
i
wanted
at
this
point
to
bring
in
the
analogy
of
the
premium
case,
the
leading
case
on
premium
in
this
court,
the
new
york
life
insurance
against
edwards.
there
the
court
pointed
out
that
only
on
disposition
could
it
be
known
whether
or
not
a
security
issued
at
a
premium
would
produce
profit
or
loss
and
that
is
why
the
lender
was
not
to
be
permitted
to
amortize
his
premium
course
as
against
his
income
currently
and
i
should
like
to
take
the
liberty
of
reading
the
words
of
the
court.
obviously,
no
actual
ascertainable
loss
had
occurred.
all
of
the
securities
might
have
been
sold
thereafter
above
cost.
the
result
of
the
venture
could
not
be
known
until
they
were
either
sold
or
paid
off.
mr.
justice
goldberg
raised
the
question
of
whether
the
new
provision
in
the
1954
code
applies
to
obligations
of
an
individual.
for
some
reason,
congress
has
not
done
that
but
by
the
same
token,
the
privilege
of
amortizing
premium
is
not
allowed
with
regard
to
obligations
issued
by
individuals.
the
two
things
march
along
together
for
reasons
apparently
best
known
to
the
congress.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
premium
on
private
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
premium
paid
by
the
lender
on
a
private
security
is
distinct
from
a
municipal
security.
he
may
at
the
election
of
the
lender
be
amortized
so
as
to
reduce
his
ordinary
income
including
his
income
from
the
obligation
which
he
holds.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
his
other
election
is
not
to
make
the
election
which
i
just
described
in
which
event,
it
is
an
item
of
capital
gain
or
loss
on
disposition
of
the
obligation
in
the
same
way
as
it
was
before
the
statute
was
changed
in
1942.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
public
securities;
the
lender
is
forced
to
amortize
his
premium.
there
is
no
right
of
election
on
public
securities,
tax
exempts
and
obligation
yield
on
which
--
or
the
income
from
which,
is
not
subject
to
federal
income
tax.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
no.
he
is
forced
to
amortize
it
but
without
an
offset
to
income.
the
--
since
the
--
the
interest
on
the
municipal
security
is
not
subject
to
tax,
congress
decided
that
the
premium
which
was
paid
should
not
be
permitted
to
result
in
an
eventual
capital
loss
when
the
obligation
is
disposed
of.
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
on
the
private
security,
the
amortization
of
the
premium
is
at
the
election
of
the
lender.
he
can
elect
--
mr.
bernard
e.
brandes
the
borrower?
the
borrower
must
at
all
times,
even
at
the
time
when
the
lender
could
not
reduce
his
income
from
the
obligation,
the
borrower
must
at
all
times
increase
as
it
were
his
income
because
he
is
reducing
his
cost
with
regard
to
the
carrying
of
that
obligation.
i
thank
the
court.
