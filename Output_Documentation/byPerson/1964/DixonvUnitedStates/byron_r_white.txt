justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
yield
within
the
technical
sense?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
using
a
yield
in
any
technical
sense
or
are
you
just
using
it
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
returns
that
he
had
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
must
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
must
return
all
the
interest
that
you'd
paid
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
maybe
different
than
yield.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
that's
alright,
and
then
that
isn't
what
you
mean.
do
you
mean
that
he
has
to
return
all
the
interest
you'd
paid
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody
agreed
that
if
--
that
the
state
[inaudible]
or
that
it
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
all
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
acquiescence
that
you
talked
about
here
cover
those
very
interests?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
dealing
with
discount
to
what
the
law
was
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
your
view
of
--
your
position
is
that's
just
plain
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
1954
legislation
would
have
applied
to
the
one
who
loans
on
a
note
and
a
discount
and
what
if
he
sells
the
note
then,
meanwhile?
if
he
sells
the
note
meanwhile
then
that
fellow
gets
paid
off
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
both
of
them
have
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
buyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
discount
where
--
this
is
only
--
this
applies
only
where
there
is
a
interest
not
stated?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
you
said
yesterday
that
was
only
as
of
1954,
there
was
a
case
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
lender
received
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
offsets
the
interest
that
he
receives.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that
--
now
is
that
statutory?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
that
change
the
rule
of
the
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
cases
were
treated
as
a
capital.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
as
the
lender
is
concerned
by
statute
now,
discount
and
premium
were
treated
almost
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
know
what
the
consequences
would
be
if
you
hold
it
for
the
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
--
all
you
mean
is
that
the
lender
can
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
the
borrower
can
pay
you
back,
now
you
--
that's
the
risk.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
why
the
--
does
the
record
show
why
these
notes
were
sold?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
held
that
no
maturity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
this
pretty
solvent
borrower?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
this
must
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
now
could
you
tell
me
now
--
could
you
tell
me
what
--
how
premium
is
now
treated
under
the
statute
from
the
standpoint
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
-
the
lender.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
his
other
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
how
about
public
securities?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
a
borrower
do
with
the
same
thing,
amortize
it
and
set
it
off
against
good
faith?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
private
security?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
borrower?
