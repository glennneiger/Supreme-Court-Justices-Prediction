you
don't
think
that
involves
any
acceptance
or
non-acceptance
of
the
domination
by
a
foreign
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
those
members
--
members
of
the
--
perhaps
members
of
the
communist
party
have
not
in
the
past
nor
was
anybody
proved
that
they
had
ever
engaged
in
the
political
strike
that
what
if
you
accepted
the
fact
that
--
that
they
were
under
ordinance.
what
is
the
proof
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
say
that
--
you
say
then
that
we
must
assume
here
a
party
that
--
that
they're
not
in
the
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
congressional
findings
--
congressional
findings
in
this
regard
are
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
congressional
findings
on
this
point
are
irrelevant.

what
if
he
said
they
want
to
prove
it
over,
i've
changed.
justice
byron
r.
white
i've
changed.
i'm
a
new
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
cannot
bar
me
just
making
an
argument
or
an
inference
from
what
is
likely.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
talk
about
--
let's
talk
about
the
example
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
gave
you,
not
another
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
what
about
archie
brown
has
been
convicted
to
be
--
and
he
--
and
he
comes
in
to
say,
“i'm
a
new
man.
now
don't
bar
me
from
union
office
unless
you
prove
and
give
me
a
jury
trial
on
now
whether
i
--
give
me
another
trial
now.”
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general
what
is
that
the
risk
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
like
--
like
what
--
like,
was
it
called
that
the
congress
might
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
(voice

the
likelihood
of
political
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
--
what
is
a
political
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
over
it's
really
the
political
strike
we've
got
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
there
--
are
there
some
lawful
end
to
the
communist
party
that
the
--
that
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
without
preserving
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
that
--
what
if
that's
why
is
the
communist?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
the
--
so
it's
the
strength
of
the
inference
between
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
the
inference
of
these
--
that
these
untoward
circumstances
will
occur,
events
will
occur
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
just
a
circumstantial
evidence
question.
i
mean
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
mean
the
congress
can
--
can
base
the
--
the
claming
of
the
crime
on
that
inference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
be
allow
the
court
--
well
he
can
allow
the
court
or
order
of
the
court
to
base
it's
--
or
the
court
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
find
its
membership
--
or
the
court
has
to
find
his
membership
in
the
two
organizations
at
the
same
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
congress
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
congress
then
-
and
congress
then
say
to
the
court,
you
must
therefore
conclude
why.
