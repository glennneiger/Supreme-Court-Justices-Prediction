(inaudible)
suppose
the
communists
held
hearings
and
made
a
finding
that
the
activities
of
the
ku
klux
klan
against
the
negroes
were
a
burden
on
commerce
and
were
interfering
with
rights
of
negroes
to
work,
opportunities
for
negroes
to
work.
and
would
stir
up
labor
strike,
could
--
could
they
have
made
that
finding
and
included
them
in
with
the
communist
party
and
would
you
say
it
was
valid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
although
not
all
the
cost,
it
goes
much
farther
than
that
you
might
apply
your
argument
only
to
the
facts
of
this
case
but
the
statute
does
go
much
farther
than
that.
it
says
that
if
a
man
--
if
a
man
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
he
is
disqualified
from
this
kind
of
employment
for
five
years
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
--
after
he
withdrew
the
exit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
put
it
on
the
basis
in
what
he's
--
what
he's
doing,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
statute
is
--
is
far
too
broad
for
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
in
your
opinion
a
constitutional
difference
between
those
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
believing
--
then
believing
as
you
do
that
there
is
a
constitutional
difference,
now
do
you
believe
that
if
we
held
with
you
in
this
particular
case
that
there
would
be
an
implication
that
the
other
portion
of
it
was
also
in
accordance
with
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
what
you
neither
nor
do
you
wish
to
express
the
opinion
on
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
--
we
go
rather
--
we
go
rather
far,
don't
we
in
hypotheticals,
in
--
in
arguments
here
before
the
court
both
counsel
and
ourselves
do
that
and
isn't
it
reasonable
for
the
court
to
ask
how
far
this
would
carry
us,
if
we
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
gladstein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
gladstein,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
generally
if
we
conceive
that
power
to
--
to
congress.
where
can
we
stop,
where
can
we
say
that
this
power
of
congress
conflicts
with
first
amendment
rights
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
individual?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mostly,
we
would
not
say
that
the
government
always
wins
and
the
congress
wins.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
could
we
draw
the
constitutional
line
between
the
right
to
hold
this
position
in
the
union
and
the
right
just
to
be
a
member
and
exercise
a
--
the
other
rights
of
the
membership
in
the
union.
well,
how
do
we
draw
the
constitutional
line
between
those
two
situations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
