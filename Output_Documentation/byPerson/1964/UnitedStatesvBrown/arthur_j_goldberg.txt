justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
this
respect
the
statute
as
you
have
now
described
it
is
different.
we
don't
have
the
statute
before
us
which
would
say
that
a
union
officer
was
convicted
for
example
for
violating
the
smith
act
isn't
eligible
to
serving.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
solicitor
general,
can
we
just
pause
for
a
moment
on
that
and
see
if
i
read
the
record
correctly.
the
respondent
here,
brown,
was
an
admitted
communist
as
you
have
said
and
participated
in
its
appearance.
he
was
an
open
communist.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
say
functionary,
it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
he
was
a
working
longshoreman
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
and
he
was
not
a
functionary
in
the
sense
that
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
he
was
--
he
was
a
functionary.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
although
the
statute
–
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
assuming
then
that
congress
have
enacted
statute
of
this
kind
where
congress
hear
cases
(inaudible)
and
although
here
as
i
recall
it
that
they
have
the
north
america
strike
and
i
don't
know
what
--
what
else,
some
testimony
about
korea
and
the
(inaudible).
now,
certainly
time
passes
as
now
time
has
passed.
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
offer
proof
which
was
rejected
by
the
district
judge
and
it
is
operative
proof
he
offered
show
that
local
10
of
the
longshoremen's
union
has
never
had
a
political
strike.
in
fact
they
haven't
had
any
strike
in
many
years
at
all
and
they
have
been
cited
by
the
business
groups
in
san
francisco
as
the
example
of
a
union
that
creates
stability
and
has
good
labor
management
relations.
the
court
excluded
that
evidence.
they
did
not
permit
that
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
is
it
your
that
when
congress
makes
a
finding
no
matter
how
dated
is
the
finding
may
be,
and
how
limited
the
evidence
may
be
upon
which
the
finding
is
predicated
that
that
is
binding
for
all
times
and
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
may
not
come
in
and
say
he
did
not
say
it
in
this
case,
he
disputed
the
finding
originally
but
let's
assume
he
came
and
say
whether
there
have
been
any
substance
to
that.
but
we
mended
our
ways
and
they
don't
practice.
we
don't
believe
in
political
strikes,
that
the
congressional
finding
forecloses
judicial
review
and
that
a
defendant
may
not
have
that
issue
put
before
the
jury.

but
general,
the
government
in
the
douds
brief
as
i
remember
that
i
was
in
the
douds
cases
as
i
recall.
the
government
in
the
douds
case
was
cited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
itself
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--that
another
alternative
would
be
flatly
to
forbid
communists
and
persons
believing
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
to
be
officers
i
believe
in
organizations.
this
would
have
been
much
more
grasped
in
the
affidavit
requirement
and
later
raise
more
difficult
legal
questions.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
general,
am
i
correct
that
the
logic
of
the
argument
you're
making
leads
to
this
conclusion
that
a
man
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
sense
that
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime
in
doing
so
in
this
case
and
that
type
of
man
however
could
not
hold
union
office.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
about
lovett
and
cases
like
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
was
the
penalty
in
lovett?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
you
haven't
considered
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
(voice

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
gladstein,
did
i
understand
it
correctly
is
that
outside
of
your
other
constitutional
points
that
brown
was
entitled
to
go
to
trial
under
an
evidentiary
record
and
instructions
which
sent
to
the
jury
that
if
he
was
not
that
type
of
communist
who
would
be
convicted
under
the
smith
act,
that
he
would
not
violate
this
statute
because
congress
could
be
presumed
to
mean
when
they
said
communist
here
what
they
meant
in
the
smith
act
both
in
the
criminal
statute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
suppose
mr.
gladstein,
archie
brown
had
been
convicted
of
violating
the
smith
act,
suppose
the
statute
had
been
enlarged
to
cover
that
type
of
fellow,
would
he
ran
for
office
and
said,
“here
i
am,
i'm
archie
brown.
and
i
was
convicted
of
violating
the
smith
act.
i
admit
that
i
committed
a
felony
and
i
want
to
run
for
office
and
be
elected”,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
read
this
record
correctly
you
may
then
offer
a
proof
did
you
not,
the
dean
--
professor
keeves
where
in
brown's
qualifications
to
work
on
the
document
of
challenge
in
arbitration
made
the
finding
that
brown
did
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
the
priority
is
the
openly
and
we
have
this
record
not
proposing
to
change
of
membership
of
the
communist
party
--
you
have
--
it's
that
i'd
like
to
take
you
back
for
a
moment.
you
said
that
it
gives
it
figures
and
several,
might
be
managing
this
category
that
on
page
144
of
the
record
and
witness
testified,
a
lady
who's
been
a
member
a
the
communist
party
and
did
advise
through
the
fbi.
she
testified
that
the
decision
for
archie
brown
to
accept
nomination
for
the
national
(inaudible)
that's
being
proposed
and
i
take
it
would
have
been
a
full
time
job
was
rejected
by
the
party,
that's
been
customarily
because
archie
has
been
elected
to
an
office
of
this
union,
(inaudible)
of
what
we
--
logical
interest
of
this
government,
that
the
government
would
have
not
(inaudible)
have
ignored
it,
not
taking
election
and
we
have
archie
brown
(inaudible),
is
that
all?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
what
you
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
gladstein
would
you
straighten
me
out
on
the
point
of
fact
that
has
been
assumed
here
by
you
and
by
the
solicitor
general
that
mr.
brown
was
always
a
known
member
of
the
communist
party.
but
in
going
through
this
record,
i
don't
find
anything
that
would
indicate
that
that
knowledge
was
communicated
to
his
fellow
members
of
the
union
who
elected
him
to
office
until
mrs.
thompson
took
the
stand
at
the
trial
and
identified
him
as
a
communist.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
--
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
answer
me,
was
that
after
mrs.
thompson
testified?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
asked
that
it
may
not
be
relevant
and
i
thought
that
the
fact
issue
that
was
being
made
at
the
trial
originally
was
whether
in
fact
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there's
no
wrong
about
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
have
those
record
references
handy.
don't
bother
i
can
give
it
to
them
--
