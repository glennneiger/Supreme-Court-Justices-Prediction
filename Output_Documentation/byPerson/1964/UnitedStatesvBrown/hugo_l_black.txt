justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
would
define
as
members
of
the
naacp
could
not
be
members
of
the
--
of
a
labor
union.
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
made
--
and
they
made
findings,
broad
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
would
make
the
constitution
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
mentioned
the
douds
case,
unless
i
misread
that
too.
the
argument
was
made
there
and
the
court
held
that
because
the
abridgment
was
so
small,
it
didn't
provide
for
imprisonment
of
the
man
who
had
been
a
communist
among
other
things.
this
one
does
provide
imprisonment,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
that's
because
he
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
was
also
an
officer
in
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong?
do
you
--
don't
you
read
douds
as
pointing
out,
very
carefully
and
precisely
sure
that
they
were
not
holding
that
that
it
could
ever
be
measured
a
crime
to
belong
to
the
communist
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
--
did
they
not
point
that
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
suggesting
that
the
(inaudible)
to
send
them
to
jail
for
year
if
they
do
belong
to
the
communist
party.
if
they
want
to
do
that
with
the
most
--
the
court
may
want
to
do,
hold
some
official
in
a
union,
that's
what
it
does,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
put
him
to
jail
for
a
year.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
not
if
they
have
minor
thing,
is
it?
as
i
understood
you,
implication
was
that
that's
just
a
minor
thing.
they
just
send
them
to
jail
for
a
year
if
they
want
to
be
an
officer
of
the
union
at
the
same
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
douds
--
but
douds
certainly
pointed
out
to
this,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
douds
point
out
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
thought
it
was.
i
thought
the
whole
argument
was.
they
belong
to
this
communist
front
organization.
they
just
happened
to
be
working
for
the
government
as
i
recall
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
make
reports
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
the
very
idea
of
the
bill
of
attainder
(inaudible)
certain
groups,
certain
groups
are
marked
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
--
suppose
that
penalized
them
if
they
wanted
to
advocate
the
business
of
being
investment
bank,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
get
out
and
made
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
wouldn't
if
it
marked
it
out
to
them
of
a
particular
group.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
think
out
that
that
you
people
can't
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
people
can't
advocate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
neither
the
distinctions
is
the
one
on
which
you've
based
the
statement
that
the
charge
of
this
that
the
bill
of
attainder
is
frivolous.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
with
that
viewpoint,
i
would
think
that
would
be
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
send
them
to
jail
because
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
hereafter
insofar
as
getting
of
the
trial
according
to
due
process
of
law
whether
you
charged
with
an
attempt
have
to
prove
all
the
elements
of
it
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
congress
cannot
deprive
him
of
that
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
congress
did
make
it
a
crime
to
engage
in
a
conspiracy
to
bring
about
unlawful
strikes
whatever
strikes
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
whether
they're
communist
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
claiming
that
they
then
would
have
to
prove
that
he
had
made
engagement
to
that
conspiracy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
arguing
here
in
ref
--
reference
to
bill
of
attainder
and
due
process
that
the
congress
can't
make
that
finding
for
the
court
and
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
anything
in
the
brief
which
indicates
that
the
government
does
deliberately
refrain
from
prosecuting
these
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
had
waited
to
do
this
with
the
test
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
we
could
assume
and
i
certainly
do
assume.
the
government
has
done
its
duty
in
the
prosecuted
the
late
cases
if
they
had
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
suppose,
as
i
understand
that
you're
arguing
that
the
interest
in
preventing
political
strikes
is
sufficient
to
outweigh
the
right
of
the
public
and
freedom
of
association
and
the
right
of
the
individual's
freedom
of
association.
now,
if
that
is,
why
would
it
not
be
far
more
serious
and
more
greatly
outweigh
the
right
of
those
freedoms
for
men
to
run
for
a
political
office
called
on
the
people
to
elect
him.
why
can't
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
that
i
know
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
the
court
held
that
i
didn't
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
the
case
very
well,
g-e-r-e-n-d-e.
gerende.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it
does
follow
and
i
will
suppose
it
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it's
necessarily
follows
that
if
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
they
should
keep
labor
union
from
elected
as
an
officer.
by
reason
of
the
possibility
of
political
strike
that
that
outweighs
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
freedom
of
speech.
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
congress
could
forbid
members
of
the
communist
party
to
run
for
public
office
like
a
communist
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
--
i
think
that
people
would
take
care
of
it
and
that's
what
i
thought
the
constitution
provide
it.
but
i
didn't
think
the
congress
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
exactly
the
same.
there'd
be
more
wouldn't
it?
won't
it
be
great
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
i
agree
that
you
cannot
be
sure.
