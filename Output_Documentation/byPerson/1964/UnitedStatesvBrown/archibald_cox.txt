mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
criminal
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
involves
the
constitutionality
of
section
504
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
the
disclosure
act
of
1959.
on
section
504,
it's
reprinted
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
the
relevant
parts
of
it
read,
“no
person
who
is
or
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
series
of
major
crimes
shall
serve
as
an
officer,
director,
trustee,
member
of
any
executive
board
or
similar
governing
body
or
as
various
paid
employees
of
any
labor
organization
during
or
for
five
years
after
the
termination
of
his
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
where
it
involved
his
conviction
of
any
of
those
crimes.
violation
of
this
section
is
punishable
by
a
fine
or
imprisonment.
and
where
it
is
to
the
background
of
section
504
seems
relevant.
now,
taken
as
a
whole,
it
was
enacted
as
part
of
a
rather
comprehensive
view
--
review
of
the
national
labor
policy,
but
a
review
concerned
primarily
with
abuses
in
the
direction
of
labor
unions
and
the
management
of
their
internal
affairs.
in
the
main
and
again
taken
in
general,
now
section
504
resulted
from
evidence
before
the
mclachlan
investigating
committee
which
showed
that
a
number
of
unions
had
admitted
criminal
elements
into
office
of
the
other
important
paid
positions
for
improper
and
often
criminal
purposes
to
the
injury
both
of
the
union
members
and
the
general
public.
a
part
of
the
remedy
congress
concluded
was
to
prohibit
convicted
criminals
for
a
period
of
time
from
holding
union
office
or
from
holding
important
paid
positions.
when
i
say
for
a
shorthand
union
office,
i
don't
mean
to
exclude
the
others
in
the
string
but
that's
a
convenient
way
to
express
myself.
now,
we're
not
concerned
immediately
with
convictions
of
crime.
here,
we're
concerned
with
membership
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
indeed
--
indeed
i
believe
that
isn't
one
of
the
crimes
listed.
now,
this
is
simply
one
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
at
the
same
time,
congress
was
dealing
with
the
problem
of
criminals
in
important
positions
in
labor
unions.
it
reviewed
the
parallel
problem
although
a
somewhat
different
problem
of
permitting
the
communist
party
from
taking
over
positions
of
power
in
labor
unions
also
to
the
injury
of
union
members
and
the
general
public.
in
1959,
as
you
will
recall,
the
existing
law
was
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
now,
the
statute
upheld
that
american
communications
workers
against
douds.
section
9
(a)
which
was
designed
to
serve
the
purpose
i've
mentioned
prohibited
--
provided
that
no
labor
organization
should
enjoy
the
use
of
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
unless
they
were
on
file
affidavits
from
all
its
officers
to
the
effect
that
at
the
time
of
making
the
affidavit
they
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
this
supplied
generally
to
every
officer
of
every
union
that
wished
to
take
a
case
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
the
10
or
11
years
since
the
enactment
of
section
9(a),
it
had
proved
faulty
for
a
number
of
reasons.
for
one
thing
on
its
face,
it
was
an
obvious
upfront
to
union
officers
whose
loyalty
was
unquestioned.
it
had
proved
burdensome
and
unworkable
in
other
respects
that
i'll
outline
further
on
my
argument.
accordingly,
what
congress
did
in
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
was
to
repeal
section
9(h)
and
substitute
the
provisions
of
section
504
which
forbid
of
--
members
of
the
communist
party
to
be
officers
of
labor
unions.
now,
in
the
present
case,
i
must
emphasize,
that
we
deal
only
with
the
prohibition
against
holding
union
office
and
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
after
the
enactment
of
section
504
and
that
one
and
the
same
time,
the
statute
has
a
broader
reach
in
some
respect
but
the
evidence
at
respondent's
trial
showed
very
plainly
that
he
was
not
only
a
member
but
a
rather
active
functionary
of
the
communist
party
while
he
was
serving
on
the
executive
board
of
local
10
of
the
international
longshoreman
and
warehouse
worker's
union,
and
that
those
events
did
take
place
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
it's
indeed
the
indictment
covering
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
as
i
implied
that,
i
was
--
i
was
mistaken.
mr.
archibald
cox
indeed
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
is
to
be
taken
into
account.
my
case
in
no
way
turns
under
degree
of
his
activity.
i
guess
that
was
just
a
little
argumentation
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
but
i
don't
think
our
case
would
be
any
different.
i
don't
really
suggest
there
any
legal
consequences
turn
on
that.
but
the
point
i
am
seeking
to
emphasize
is
that
this
is
not
an
instance
in
which
the
defendant
was
indicted
for
serving
as
an
officer
of
a
labor
union
because
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1958
and
had
ceased
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
or
even
in
1962
and
had
ceased
before
coming
a
union
officer
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
here,
he
was
doing
both
at
one
in
the
same
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statute
--
the
statute
is
broader
but
i
submit
that
the
two
questions
are
clearly
separable.
and
i
direct
myself
only
to
the
question
we
have
here.
on
the
evidence,
respondent
was
convicted.
he
appealed
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
held
by
a
divided
both
that
section
504
as
applied
to
communist
party
membership
is
unconstitutional.
and
since
the
validity
of
an
act
of
the
congress
is
involved,
we
brought
the
case
here.
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
three
issues
submitted
to
the
court
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties.
one
is
whether
section
504
violates
the
first
amendment
because
it
infringes
the
rights
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
association.
another
claim
made
by
the
respondent
is
that
section
504
violates
the
fifth
amendment
under
some
of
the
reasoning
in
the
scales
and
noto
cases.
and
then
a
third
issue
raised
by
respondent
is
that
this
statute
is
an
ex
post
facto
law
and
the
bill
of
attainder.
the
real
issue,
the
troublesome
issue
is
whether
the
statute
violates
the
first
amendment.
the
other
two
seemed
to
me
really
to
be
quite
simple.
indeed
the
argument
that
this
bill
of
attainder
or
ex
post
facto
law
i
think
is
frivolous.
at
the
outset
therefore,
i
shall
direct
myself
to
the
issue
of
pre
--
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
association
and
deal
with
the
latter
points
on
the
labor.
in
dealing
with
the
issue
whether
the
statute
violates
the
first
amendment,
i
want
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
two
propositions
which
i
think
are
incontrovertible.
the
first
is
that
absent
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
bill
of
rights,
section
504
would
plainly
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
having
chosen
to
support
and
promote
collective
bargaining
as
a
means
of
encouraging
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
protecting
the
rights
of
employees,
congress
was
certainly
entitled
to
take
steps
to
prevent
abuse
of
the
power
thus
conferred
on
the
union
by
limiting
the
likelihood
that
their
energies
would
be
diverted
away
from
any
normal
trade
union
purposes
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
public
and
to
the
disadvantage
of
union
members.
to
give
one
specific
illustration
that
it's
only
one,
the
exclusion
of
members
of
the
communist
party
from
office
in
labor
unions
is
a
way
of
reducing
the
likelihood
of
political
strikes
which
would
not
only
disrupt
commerce,
interfere
with
the
public
welfare,
but
also
cause
losses
to
union
members
without
any
commensurate
hope
of
economic
benefits
and
might
well
weaken
and
destroy
the
unions
and
impair
their
ability
to
perform
the
functions
that
the
national
labor
policy
gives.
the
interest
in
that
diversion
of
union
energy,
as
we
say,
and
the
resulting
injuries
to
the
public
and
to
the
union
members
certainly
matters
within
the
legitimate
scope
of
governmental
concern,
the
legitimate
scope
of
legislative
concern.
i
should
also
emphasize
in
this
connection
that
there's
nothing
noble
about
the
approach
of
section
504
although
of
course
as
we
shall
see
in
a
moment
it
comes
closer
to
affecting
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
association
than
it's
analyzed.
but
the
principle
that
a
man
shall
not
serve
two
masters
or
attempt
to
serve
two
masters,
is
a
very
old
one.
the
common
law
recognized
the
evil
in
man's
occupying
dual
positions
in
which
they
would
be
subject
to
conflicting
loyalties.
the
united
states
code
is
for
all
instances
in
which
government
officials
are
forbidden
to
hold
interest
in
private
enterprises
with
which
they
may
have
to
deal,
the
provision
outlying
interlocking
directorates
is
a
familiar
one
and
the
board
of
governors
against
agnew
this
court
had
before
it
a
provision
forbidding
a
partner
or
employee
of
an
investment
banking
house
from
serving
as
an
officer
or
director
of
a
federal
reserve
bank.
this
is
in
other
words
a
rather
familiar
technique
and
here
in
effect
what
congress
has
done
is
the
same
thing.
it
is
said
that
a
man
shall
not
or
while
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
therefore
presumably
subject
to
loyalty
to
it
and
perhaps
to
its
discipline
at
the
same
time
hold
office
in
a
labor
union
where
he
may
be
disabled
because
of
those
conflicting
loyalties
from
performing
his
obligations
to
the
union
members
and
to
the
public
faithfully
and
wholeheartedly.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
there
were
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
our
industrial
relations,
they
parallel
in
the
evidence
that
was
available,
then
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
one
and
only
one
important
difference
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
communist
party
is
different
from
most
other
organization
that
it
is
subject
to
domination
by
a
power
and
that
this
greatly
increases
many
of
the
threats
that
it
presents.
whether
that
would
be
a
decisive
difference
i
don't
mean
to
say
but
i
think
it's
a
difference
in
our
favor
in
this
case.
i
would
also
doubt,
mr.
chief
justice,
so
i
confess
i
don't
know
the
evidence
whether
the
record
of
history
would
be
as
persuasive
on
that
point
in
terms
of
effect
through
labor
unions
as
the
evidence
dealing
with
the
communist
party
because
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
evidence
that
the
ku
klux
klan
has
engaged
in
its
activities
through
labor
unions.
and
i
would
think
therefore
that
a
law
forbidding
members
of
the
klan
from
being
officers
of
labor
unions
came
much
closer
to
being
a
penalty,
a
sanction
than
a
prophylactic
measure
directed
at
future
dangers
which
is
what
we
think
this
statute
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
this
court
is
entitled
especially
in
a
case
involving
freedom
of
association
to
scrutinize
the
findings
and
determine
whether
they
have
some
rational
basis.
we
say
here
that
history
supplies
and
i
will
relate
some
of
them,
a
very
clear
foundation
for
the
congressional
conclusion
that
the
occupancy
of
these
dual
position
does
carry
a
threat
to
commerce,
to
union
members
and
to
the
national
welfare.
i
should
emphasize
too
or
also
perhaps
i
stick
too
much
of
the
word,
your
honor,
here
that
this
statute
unlike
the
one
you
just
posed
does
not
forbid
members
of
the
communist
party
to
be
members
of
a
labor
union.
it
does
not
forbid
them
to
be
--
employment
or
it
does
not
forbid
them
some
paid
positions
in
labor
unions
also
they're
only
declarative
one.
this
is
a
rather
limited
restriction
that
was
the
second
part
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize
in
the
beginning.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
each
--
i
would
think,
yes.
i
would
think
that
the
extent
of
the
prohibition
if
you
broaden
it
from
the
holding
of
union
office
to
being
a
member
of
a
labor
union
at
all,
you
are
extending
the
sanction,
the
prohibition,
the
regulation,
a
great
deal
further
than
if
it
has
confined
the
union
office.
you
also
apply
it
to
positions
which
may
or
may
not
be
positions
of
potential
influence.
a
union
officer
and
certain
paid
officials
of
labor
unions,
paid
employees
like
organizers,
international
representatives
have
far
more
power
than
the
ordinary
union
member.
and
i
think
all
these
must
be
taken
into
account.
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize
indeed,
part
of
which
i
have
made
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
is
that
section
504
does
not
prohibit
the
holding
or
expression
of
any
views
or
call
for
the
censoring
of
speech
or
publication.
it
does
not
outlaw
any
organizational
activity
or
association
not
even
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
it
touches,
and
this
is
the
point
i
was
making
before,
a
very
limited
class
of
persons
only
those
who
wish
to
be
officers
or
paid
employees
of
a
labor
union.
and
all
it
does
with
respect
to
those
persons
is
put
them
to
a
choice.
they
may
join
the
communist
party.
they
may
engage
in
all
its
activities
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
all
its
lawful
activities
so
far
as
any
statute
is
concerned
or
they
may
be
officers
of
labor
unions.
the
only
thing
that
it
is
prohibited
is
occupying
both
positions.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
five
years
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
if
we
have
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
statute
where
the
--
its
validity
must
be
judged
as
applied
in
this
case.
but
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
validity
of
all
the
provisions
of
section
504,
as
however
applied,
are
before
the
court.
now
i
think
the
difference
is
this
that
where
--
that
the
question
that
we
ultimately
come
down
to
here
is
whether
the
evil
that
congress
was
seeking
to
remedy,
to
prevent
the
rising
is
sufficiently
great
to
justify
this
restriction
incidental
partial
abridgment
as
the
court
called
it
in
douds
as
collateral
restriction
on
freedom
of
speech
or
association
is
too
great
to
be
justified
by
the
evil
within
the
legitimate
congressional
concern
that
congress
was
trying
to
remedy.
there
is
a
difference
clearly
between
the
cases
that
your
honor
calls
my
attention
to
and
the
present
case.
one
who
is
presently
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
wants
to
be
a
union
officer
is
if
i
may
put
it
in
these
terms,
a
far
worst
risk.
the
likelihood
that
he
will
submit
to
communist
discipline,
the
likelihood
that
he
feels
a
loyalty
to
the
party
and
consistent
with
his
faithful
performance
of
his
duties
as
a
union
officer
is
clearly
greater
than
in
the
case
of
one
who
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
has
bonafidely
left
the
party.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir,
because
i
think
that
the
constitutional
issue
turns
here
on
the
degree
of
the
risk
created
by
the
man's
being
an
officer
of
a
labor
union.
if
he
simply
was
an
officer
of
the
labor
union
in
the
past,
all
we
know
is
that
one
time
he
felt
some
loyalty
to
perhaps
one
should
say
some
of
the
things
the
communist
party
was
doing
particularly
if
you
carry
far
in
effect
in
--
in
time.
he
is
nowhere
near
as
bad
a
risk
as
a
person
who
is
presently
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wound
think
that
would
depend
on
how
the
opinion
was
written.
i
am
arguing
that
the
only
case
before
the
court
is
this
case.
and
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
anything
about
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
especially
those
relating
to
past
membership
of
the
communist
party.
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
your
honor
my
--
my
duty
of
course
in
all
of
these
cases
of
acts
of
congress
is
to
defend
them.
that
hardly
has
any
choice
of
the
matter
i
think
where
congress
has
acted.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
quite
and
--
and
i'm
sorry
i
thought
i
had
been
responsive.
i
do
not
think
that
upholding
our
contention
in
this
case
would
carry
you
to
sustaining
or
indicating
in
anyway
the
validity
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
someone
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
held
the
violation
of
the
statute
--
the
--
held
the
union
office
in
violation
of
the
statute.
no,
i
meant
to
be
perfectly
unequivocal
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
case
it
isn't
here
because
of
my
position.
i
prefer
not
to
express
a
personal
opinion
of
it.
i
certainly
can't
express
an
official
opinion
which
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
archibald
cox
provides
for
imprisonment
of
a
man
who
violates
the
statute,
yes.
there
is
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
that's
because
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
an
officer
of
the
union
in
this
case
at
one
and
the
same
time
(voice
overlap)
and
that's
the
prohibited
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
i'm
sure
they
didn't
hold
that
nor
we're
making
any
such
contention.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
pointed
out
in
douds.
it
was
pointed
out
subsequently
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
aptheker
that
the
statute
in
douds
was
not
an
absolute
prohibition
against
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
a
union
officer
at
one
and
the
same
time.
and
in
this
respect,
the
statutes
are
clearly
distinguishable.
i'm
going
to
argue
as
i
get
a
little
farther
on.
i
think
it
comes
better
than
if
i
may.
that
when
you
take
the
net
effect
on
individual
rights,
on
personal
right,
that
this
statute
might
well
be
viewed
as
a
lesser
infringement
on
the
whole
than
the
statute
in
douds.
and
i
shall
still
argue
a
little
bit
further
on.
before
getting
there,
i
want
to
make
a
point.
that
under
a
line
of
cases
beginning
back
with
united
public
workers
against
mitchell,
it's
been
held
that
an
indirect
collateral
consequential
or
partial
abridgement
as
it
was
set
in
douds
of
the
freedoms
of
speech
or
association
resulting
from
congressional
action
directed
at
some
evil
conduct
that
the
congress
has
the
right
to
deal
with
is
not
to
be
judged
simply
by
whether
the
statute
does
have
some
impact
upon
speech
but
it
is
to
be
judged
by
whether
the
incidental
impact
on
speech
cannot
be
justified
by
the
need
for
a
remedy
for
dealing
with
some
evil
within
the
scope
of
congressional
concern.
we
think
that's
established
by
united
public
workers
against
mitchell
and
the
whole
line
of
cases
running
through
douds,
adler
against
board
of
education,
garner
against
the
board
of
supervisors
in
los
angeles,
that
the
holdings
of
those
cases
were
recognized
in
speiser
and
randall,
recognized
again
subsequently
in
the
--
the
case
involving
a
lawyer
from
konigsberg
against
state
bar
and
that
one
must
make
this
inquiry
by
this
balancing
if
you
will
in
this
case
unless
a
whole
line
of
this
court's
precedents
are
to
be
overturned.
i
turn
therefore
to
examine
the
public
interest
which
section
504
is
designed
to
secure
and
that
as
i've
said
of
course
is
to
prevent
persons
whose
dominant
loyalty
is
to
the
communist
party
from
subverting
labor
unions
to
the
wishes
of
a
foreign
dominated
conspiracy.
the
factual
background
was
elaborately
briefed
in
the
douds
case.
the
court
after
reviewing
it
concluded,
congress
had
a
great
mass
of
material
before
it
which
tended
to
show
that
communists
had
infiltrated
union
organizations
not
to
support
in
further
trade
union
objectives
including
the
advocacy
of
change
by
democratic
means
but
to
make
them
device
by
which
commerce
and
industry
might
be
disrupted
when
the
dictates
of
political
policy
required
such
action.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
first
your
honor's
abstract
the
question
come
to
this
case
in
a
moment.
i
take
it
that
it's
settled
that
if
there
has
been
an
apparent
radical
change
in
the
circumstances
that
a
previous
congressional
finding
is
not
binding,
there
the
world
war
i
case
is
dealing
like
that
in
the
chastleton
hotel
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
second,
i
would
doubt
--
so.
and
i
think
there's
a
bit
reasonableness
of
the
finding
is
always
open
to
scrutiny
by
the
court.
next
point,
i
would
doubt
very
much
whether
where
the
question
was
rather
general
one
of
background
that
this
was
an
item
on
which
the
court
is
required
to
take
evidence
and
make
findings
on
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
this
kind
of
constitutional
fact
is
something
that
the
court
determines
by
methods
according
to
judicial
notice
rather
than
by
being
limited
to
specific
testimony.
here,
i
would
say,
that
i
do
not
understand
that
the
evidence
went
so
far
as
to
offer
the
show
that
the
communist
party
had
changed
its
character
and
that
the
findings
of
the
congress
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
are
a
good
deal
more
current
than
the
political
strikes
that
had
taken
place
in
the
past.
and
that
the
record
over
the
past
would
sufficiently
continue.
it
may
go
farther
back
but
your
honor
we'll
recall
that
at
least
there
was
the
case
of
the
garment
workers
in
new
york
in
mid-1920s
which
david
dubinsky
is
described
how
against
the
interest
of
the
union.
the
communist
infiltrators
had
protracted
that
strike
and
almost
wiped
out
the
union
as
well
as
the
industry.
so
we
go
on
through
a
series
of
these
things
over
a
period
of
time.
they're
very
--
they're
described
better
than
i
can
describe
them
in
the
various
reports
of
the
cio
committees
when
the
seven
--
11
unions
were
expelled
in
the
early
50s
just
about
1950
from
the
cio.
one
of
those
unions
of
course
was
ciowu.
and
it
was
specifically
characterized
as
one
which
did
not
operate
for
the
benefit
of
the
american
worker
but
subject
to
the
dictates
of
a
foreign
conspiracy.
so
that
i
don't
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
can
be
said
that
there
is
any
real
reason
to
suppose
that
the
basic
facts
available
to
congress
on
which
to
make
up
its
minded
change.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
no
--
no
finding.
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
--
in
our
brief,
we've
related
to
evidence
before
other
congressional
committees.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
no.
i
--
i
would
think
that
the
view
was
the
court
was
not
bound
by
any
findings
or
any
record
before
the
congressional
committee
just
as
congressmen
were
not
bound
by
those.
i
submit
that
all
that
material,
all
the
action
of
the
cio,
the
knowledge
of
the
labor
movement
and
the
people
who
studied
the
labor
movement
which
is
available
in
literature
are
all
things
on
the
basis
of
which
congressmen
were
entitled
to
make
up
their
mind
and
which
this
court
is
entitled
to
take
into
account
too.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
it
had
the
same
aim
(voice
overlap).
let
me
--
let
me
come
directly
to
the
changes
between
9
(h)
and
this
act
but
to
just
say
a
transitional
word
in
order
to
make
my
point
clear.
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
this
material
concerning
the
record
of
the
communist
party
in
labor
unions,
the
whole
mass
of
it
shows
that
this
was
a
very
real
evil
that
communists
have
subverted
labor
union,
that
they
have
called
very
damaging
strikes
and
that
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
consider
the
consequences
of
the
east
coast
longshoremen's
strike,
another
that
we
recently
experienced,
to
realize
the
extent
of
--
at
which
communist
domination
of
the
iowu
has
been
found
to
conceive
of
those
two
facts
and
the
extent
to
which
unions
that
are
communist-dominated
have
followed
the
communist
line
and
one
can
see
the
character
of
the
evil
that
congress
was
concerned
with.
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
clearly,
we're
not.
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
imply
anything
more
than
the
cause.
i'm
glad
your
honor
brought
that
out.
i
--
last
thing
in
my
mind.
now,
it
is
said
that
congress
might
have
dealt
with
this
evil
more
narrowly
and
of
course
if
it
could
have
dealt
with
this
evil
more
narrowly
than
this
statute
which
admittedly
put
some
pressure
on
people
to
give
up
associations.
it
may
put
some
pressure
on
them
to
refrain
to
speak
would
under
the
test
of
aptheker
and
other
cases,
i
suppose
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
here
we
say
simply
that
there
is
no
effective
narrower
way
of
coming
at
it.
certainly,
the
weight
until
a
political
strike
or
until
a
union
has
been
communist
infiltrated
is
too
late.
indeed,
it's
very
difficult
to
prove
and
that
of
course
would
be
out
of
the
bond
by
that
time.
alright
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
they
can
be
union
members
and
they
can
have
jobs.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
two,
like
in
a
conflict
of
interest
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
may
if
they
violate
the
statute
just
as
if
i
upon
leaving
the
government
should
engage
in
practice
against
the
government
in
the
matter
that
came
before
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
would
certainly
be
subject
to
fines
and
i
think
to
imprisonment.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
your
honor,
my
--
what
i
sought
to
say
was
not
their
going
to
jail
for
a
year
was
a
minor
thing.
they
viewed
as
a
whole
forcing
a
person
to
make
certain
--
make
this
choice
was
a
minor
and
indirect
interference
with
freedom
of
speech
or
political
association.
now,
if
congress
can
forbid
this,
if
it
has
the
right
to
enact
such
a
blanket
prohibition,
then
i
submit
certainly
it
can
make
no
difference
of
whether
that
is
enforced
by
quo
warranto
or
by
a
civil
injunction
or
by
a
reasonable
criminal
penalty.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
of
one
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
it
--
douds
point
out
the
difference.
i
sought
state
a
moment
ago.
but
it
wasn't
an
absolute
prohibition
but
i
was
seeking
to
make
a
point
that
if
congress
may
enact
the
absolute
prohibition,
then
surely
the
character
of
the
remedy,
the
sanction
doesn't
matter.
one
doesn't
have
the
right
to
violate
law
or
pay
a
little
fine
and
the
law
is
constitutional.
but
if
he
violates
the
law
and
has
to
go
to
jail,
then
the
law
is
unconstitutional.
the
validity
of
the
law
depends
on
whether
congress
may
enact
such
a
restriction.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
now
the
differ
--
mr.
archibald
cox
for
--
for
making
false
affidavits.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
let
me
come
--
mr.
archibald
cox
let
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
the
fact
that
the
court
said
it
was
a
different
case,
i
submit,
does
not
show
that
this
unconstitutional.
it
shows
that
it's
a
case
that
has
not
been
decided.
and
that's
what
we
have
to
decide
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
true.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
solicitor
general
thought
it
would
raise
more
difficult
questions.
it
perhaps
tempers
that
a
little
that
the
government's
argument
in
douds
was
that
there
was
no
constitutional
question
at
all
because
this
was
just
a
privilege
and
of
course
the
court
disagreed
with
that.
so
the
court
did
to
some
extent
say
that
douds
was
a
harder
case
than
the
government
viewed
it
this
way.
but
i
--
i
concede,
i
can't
argue
that
douds
is
an
all
force
with
this.
it
isn't
and
the
question
is
an
open
one.
douds
wouldn't
have
to
be
overruled
to
strike
to
balance
the
other
way
here.
what
i
do
submit
is
that
if
you
take
section
9
(h)
and
take
this
statute
and
examine
the
differences
that
this
on
the
whole
is
a
much
fairer
or
more
effective,
more
workable
statute
and
i
think
that
congress
could
well
if
included
in
all
seriousness
that
this
on
the
whole
was
less
of
an
interference
with
individual
are
first
to
liberty
even
though
it
is
the
blank
--
blanket
prohibition.
now,
let
me
try
to
explain
the
thinking
that
went
in
to
the
differences
between
this
statute
in
douds
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
of
course
would
test
whether
my
statement
is
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
believe
that
this
is
the
only
one.
i
sought
to
inquire
into
this
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
had
to
do
it
by
word
of
mouth
so
that
the
records
couldn't
be
checked.
but
the
information
i
was
given
was
that
this
was
the
only
prosecution
that's
filed.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
certainly
is
from
the
respondent's
point
of
view
where
he
announced
that
he
was
making
a
test
case
of
it
and
that
we
were
confronted
with
his
desire
to
test
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
in
all
effect,
yes,
yes.
alright
now
let
me
developed
a
little
of
the
differences
between
the
9
(h)
and
the
present
statute.
the
fir
--
one
difference,
one
trouble
with
section
9
(h)
was
that
it
was
ineffectual.
one
have
--
one
violated
it
only
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
moment
he
swore
to
the
affidavit
and
this
invited
people
to
resign
their
membership,
make
the
affidavit
and
then
resume
membership.
and
there
are
some
statements,
some
testimony
to
the
effect
that
that
happened
on
a
substantial
scale.
it
is
also
true
that
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
a
strong
well-organized
union,
a
union
with
the
economic
strength
to
do
the
most
damage
could
ignore
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
retain
its
communist
member
officers.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
did.
i
don't
want
to
make
too
much
of
that
because
nearly
all
the
international
union
and
all
those
reputed
to
be
communist-infiltrated
did
come
into
compliance.
no
one's
ever
suggested
the
mine
workers
or
the
typographers
the
only
two
internationals
that
stayed
outside
had
any
communist
domination.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
typographers.
second,
section
9
(h)
posed
an
enormous
administrative
burden.
every
time
a
union
instituted
a
case,
you
have
to
check
whether
all
its
officers
and
all
the
officers
of
any
parent
organization
of
what
currently
in
compliance
with
these
involved
stacks
of
filing
cases
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
affidavits
to
be
checked
over.
furthermore,
and
more
important,
i
think,
section
9
(h)
was
unsound
from
the
standpoint
of
labor
management
relations
and
inequitable
from
the
standpoint
of
employees
and
union
members.
under
section
9
(f),
union
members
lost
much
of
the
protection
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
whenever
an
individual
officer
was
unwilling
to
file
the
affidavit.
the
officer
was
not
ousted,
the
danger
was
not
substantially
alleviated
and
the
employees
suffered
the
most.
alright,
now
i
would
emphasize
that
this
withdrawing
protection
from
employees
while
it
affects
economic
rights,
i
submit
to
you
seriously,
also
affects
a
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
affects,
whether
it
affects
the
right
to
bargain
collectively,
that
too
is
not
simply
an
economic
right
or
even
striking,
picketed,
are
not
solely
economic
rights.
and
there's
an
element
of
individual
liberty
and
association
of
freedom
on
that
side.
furthermore,
since
section
9
(h)
simply
withdrew
the
facilities
of
the
labor
board,
this
put
in
many
ways
the
effect
of
sanction
is
in
the
hands
of
the
employer.
he
could
bargain
with
the
union
if
he
wanted
to
or
he
could
raise
the
technical
objection
if
he
wanted
to.
or
if
he
wanted
to
delay
or
obstruct
proceedings
before
the
board,
he
could
raise
questions
of
bulk
of
clients
of
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
as
well
as
take
advantage
of
negligence
in
filing
affidavit.
now,
this
was,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief
a
very,
very
real
problem.
and
as
i
submit
while
those
may
seem
technical
at
the
outset,
that
they
do
affect
the
full
freedom
of
association
and
collective
bargaining
by
employees.
fourth
and
most
important,
section
9
(h)
was
in
the
front
to
union
officers
generally
because
it
singled
them
out
from
the
entire
community
and
required
them
unlike
all
other
citizens
how
to
file
oaths
that
they
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
interest
did
not
being
subjected
to
such
an
upfront.
the
interest
did
not
having
to
take
a
test
oath,
i
submit.
it
is
certainly
very
close
to
a
first
amendment
right,
if
it
is
not
in
fact
the
first
amendment
right.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
congress
could
surely
give
effect
to
that
consideration
in
devising
a
remedy
for
this
evil.
now,
if
you
tote
these
things
up,
when
it
comes
to
i
think
is
this,
one
that
section
504
is
a
more
effective
measure
both
administratively
and
in
terms
of
reaching
the
people.
second,
while
it
does,
as
mr.
justice
black
has
suggested,
put
more
pressure
on
the
man,
the
member
of
the
communist
party
to
choose
between
such
membership
and
union
officers
because
it's
an
absolute
prohibition
against
doing
both
and
not
simply
a
pressure
on
the
union
to
put
pressure
on
him.
and
to
that
extent
it
is
a
greater
infringement
of
freedom
for
association.
still
against
that
have
to
be
balanced
of
both
the
gains
in
terms
of
the
employees'
freedom
of
association,
the
union
members'
freedom
of
association,
and
the
non-communist
officers
and
the
employees
being
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
taking
a
test
oath.
i
would
say
that
whatever
when
they
think
of
the
merits
or
demerits
of
this
statute
that
it
was
a
very
great
improvement
over
section
9
(h)
on
net
effect.
from
an
overall
point
of
view
despite
the
clear
difference
on
one
point
it
does
distinguish
douds
case.
but
to
look
at
it
as
a
whole,
i
would
argue
that
this
is
not
a
greater
restriction
than
what
was
sustained
in
douds.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
to
deal
with
other
points
raised
in
the
court
below.
one
was
that
this
was
--
the
sanction
was
a
criminal
penalty.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
the
fact
that
this
is
an
absolute
prohibition
as
distinguished
from
a
stimulus
is
of
course
relevant.
and
i've
tried
to
express
the
reasons
for
thinking
that
it
is
permissible
to
have
the
absolute
prohibition.
if
it
is
permissible
to
have
the
absolute
prohibition,
then
i
submit
most
strenuously
that
it
can't
matter
whether
you
enforce
it
by
quo
warranto
or
by
criminal
penalties
or
by
an
injunction
or
by
any
other
means
of
enforcing
that
absolute
prohibition.
because
criminal
laws
aren't
bribes
to
do
and
pay
the
penalty
or
comply
with
the
statute.
the
duty
is
to
comply
with
the
statute.
the
other
case
where
the
character
of
the
penalty
might
be
relevant
or
where
the
statute
is
vague
and
a
very
heavy
penalty
would
put
pressure
on
one
to
stay
on
the
right
side
of
the
line
is
not
involved
here,
but
in
the
application
of
this
statute,
its
meaning
are
perfectly
clear.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
would
say
that's
exactly
what
is
involved
and
i
would
say
that
the
scales
case,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
is
different
because
in
the
noto
case
because
they're
forbidding
him
to
hold
union
office
is
not
a
penalty
there.
that
isn't
what's
concerned
at
all.
it's
the
cre
--
if
the
statute
looks
to
future
dangers
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
lovett
again
was
regarded
as
a
clear
case
of
a
penalty.
mr.
archibald
cox
penalty
was
a
prohibition
against
the
government
ever
paying
them.
furthermore,
those
were
singled
out
three
identified
individuals.
there
was
no
suggestion
as
i
understand
it
no
argument
was
made
in
lovett.
that
for
these
three
men
to
work
with
the
government
would
in
some
way,
threatened
the
government's
operation.
i
don't
understand
that
that
view
was
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
your
honor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
this
is
--
i
wasn't
here
reading
the
opinions.
i
didn't
realize
that
that
was
the
argument
that
perhaps
it
was.
there
is,
of
course,
another
difference
and
that
is
that
the
statute
singled
out
these
specific
individuals
when
there
were
others
who
had
belonged
to
the
same
organization
and
were
free
to
work
for
the
government.
the
fact
that
a
statute
forbids
a
particular
class
of
people
from
engaging
in
certain
activities
isn't
an
ex
post
facto
law
or
nor
is
it
the
bill
of
attainder
if
the
class
is
large
enough.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
marked
--
depends
whether
they're
marked
out
for
punishment
or
marked
out
for
forbidding
not
to
en
--
engage
in
activities
which
in
the
future
will
be
dangerous
because
of
those
in
the
group
have
certain
characteristic
which
if
they
are
in
the
other
position
will
create
conflicting
loyalty.
certainly
--
certainly
the
conflict
of
interest
laws
aren't
bills
of
attainder.
the
stat
--
federal
statute
in
effect
provides
and
that
no
attorney
now
in
the
department
of
justice
may
handle
the
case
against
the
government
within
five
years
of
his
employment
that
comes
before
any
division
of
the
department
of
justice
in
which
he
was
employed.
now,
that's
not
a
bill
of
attainder
also
it's
an
unidentifiable
group,
the
same
way
the
statute
in
board
of
governors
against
agnew
which
forbid
investment
bankers
from
being
officers
of
a
member
bank
in
the
federal
reserve
system.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
one
would
have
to
be
quite
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
first,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
it
into
a
bill
of
attainder.
it
would
raise
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
marks
them
out
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
depends
whether
he
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
depends
whether
there
is
a
--
there's
a
first
amendment
question
of
course.
but
it
depends
on
whether
the
characteristics
of
the
group
are
related
to
the
position
they
want
to
occupy
in
a
way
that
having
the
two
creates
danger
of
a
future
evil.
now
of
course
you
can't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
--
this
--
these
are,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
submit
this
is
what
the
cases
have
come
to
us
and
just
as
the
early
cases
on
bill
of
attainder
we're
very
specific
in
saying
that
the
characteristics
which
disqualified
people
from
practicing,
holding
professions
in
missouri
or
from
being
an
attorney
at
the
bar
of
this
court
could
not
in
any
sense
be
thought
of
as
desirable
qualifications
for
the
office.
that
they
had
no
relation
to
each
other,
now
of
course
any
statute
that
takes
a
particular
group
that
the
statute
says
that
“no
man
over
30
years
old
shall
be
officers
of
labor
union.”
it
would
be
very
hard
to
relate
that
characteristic
to
any
danger
that
might
result
from
there
being
in
office.
but
all
conflict
of
interest
statutes
of
course
identifies
certain
groups
to
which
they
apply.
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
reasonable
relationship
between
the
two
things.
and
it's
on
that
point
that
i
sought
to
emphasize
the
history
of
this
problem
in
the
labor
movement.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
just
two
points
that
i'd
like
to
deal
with
very
briefly.
it
has
been
intimated
perhaps
i
should
say
during
the
argument
that
there
might
be
a
question
whether
this
statute
could
be
construed
as
not
applying
the
communist
party
membership
in
the
broad
sense
of
any
knowing
membership
but
narrowed
as
in
the
sense
of
the
smith
act.
i
wouldn't
say
that
was
impossible,
i
find
two,
quite
real
difficulties
with
that
any
such
construction
that
i
would
like
just
to
mention.
one
is
that
was
never
the
construction
as
i
understand
it
given
the
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
that
it
was
always
assumed
to
at
least
cover
on
--
no
membership
when
you
knew
you
were
a
member.
and
this
--
the
legislative
history
shows
rather
plainly
was
intended
as
a
substitute
and
i
think
that
i
reflect
what
the
legislative
history
says
and
not
some
personal
knowledge
or
impressions
i
got
that
everyone
assume
that
the
two
were
coextensive.
second,
there
is
this
difference.
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act,
of
course,
was
concerned
directly
with
membership
in
an
organization
intending
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
now,
i
suppose
it's
quite
possible
that
what
might
be
a
knowing
communist
and
the
intent
to
manipulate
a
union
through
his
office
in
the
union
to
serve
communist
purposes
without
intending
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
so
that
the
narrowing
would
not
be
directed
to
the
evil
with
which
this
statute
apparently
was
directed.
i
think
those
are
things
that
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
in
weighing
that
question.
the
other
thing
to
which
i'd
like
to
direct
myself
is
to
try
once
again
with
the
risk
of
reputation
to
come
down
to
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
truly
fundamental
interest
here,
the
question
here
that
i
can
do
it
best
by
referring
to
the
argument
that
there
has
been
no
proof
of
personal
guilt.
there
certainly
has
been
proof
of
personal
guilt
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant
did
the
things
that
the
statute
forbids.
he
had
a
trial
on
those
questions.
he
had
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
he
didn't
do
them.
the
jury
found
that
he
did
them.
of
course,
they
were
hardly
controverted.
but
certainly
there
was
a
fair
trial
in
terms
of
showing
the
things
that
the
statute
forbid.
what
the
--
what
can
be
said
is
that
well,
no
one
was
forced
to
prove
that
this
man
intended
to
abuse
his
position
in
the
union
for
the
purposes
of
the
communist
party.
but
i
suggest
without
thinking
that
this
answers
the
whole
case.
that
nothing
in
the
fifth
amendment
requires
proof
before
you
can
punish
certain
things
which
create
a
danger
of
harm
that
this
man
will
in
fact
do
the
harm
or
to
take
a
--
simple
example,
i
suppose
that
i
can
be
arrested
and
prosecuted
for
driving,
if
i
do
it
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor
and
it's
no
defense
to
say
that
i
drive
better
under
that
condition.
i
equally
--
suppose
that
i
owned
stock
in
the
civil
aeronautics
enterprise
and
became
a
member
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
i
couldn't
say
the
government
has
failed
to
prove
that
i'm
not
the
sole
of
owner
who
wouldn't
possibly
be
influenced
by
my
stock
ownership
in
the
civil
aeronautics
enterprise.
the
question
here
so
that
i
--
i
think
really
that
proof
of
personal
guilt
problem
isn't
it
--
the
question
here
is
whether
the
danger
in
the
combining
of
these
two
enterprises
--
two
positions.
first,
whether
they
have
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
evil
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
there
is
arrest
that
gets
over
the
fifth
amendment.
second,
whether
the
evil
is
great
enough
to
counter
balance
the
indirect
restriction
upon
freedom
of
association
and
if
it
is
as
we
have
submit
then
that
gets,
it's
over
the
first
amendment.
but
i
think
those
are
the
issues
on
which
the
case
must
ultimately
turn.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
risk
that
a
man
who
is
subject
to
--
who
has
loyalties
to
the
communist
party
and
subject
to
a
degree
to
its
discipline
will
use
his
position
in
the
union
to
subvert
the
union
from
--
through
trade
union
purposes,
to
the
goals
of
the
communist
party
as
it
has
been
found
that
this
union
has
done
for
example.
mr.
archibald
cox
political
strike
is
a
prime
illustration.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
i
think
sir,
i
think
that
is
the
major,
when
i
think
there
are
other
instances
where
the
union
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
have
in
mind
a
strike
like
the
north
american
strike
that
called
as
the
response
to
the
dictates
of
the
communist
party
rather
than
because
they
believe
it
will
be
in
the
interest
of
the
members
of
the
union.
the
same
is
the
strike
in
the
--
of
the
--
in
the
cloak
and
suit
industry
in
new
york
in
the
20s,
of
the
allis-chalmers
strike
in
1940
and
1941
during
the
time
with
stalin-hitler
nonaggression
pact.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
i
think
that's
the
major
thing.
but
i
think
also
your
honor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
are
many
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
there
are
many
times
where
the
desire
of
the
comm
--
the
aims
of
the
communist
party
may
coincide
with
the
goals
that
the
employees
would
have
even
if
there
were
no
communist.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
they're
--
i
acknowledged
that
it
is
possible
that
brown
or
any
other
person
may
not
himself
in
any
instance
attempt
to
misuse
his
union
position
just
as
a
particular
man
may
own
stock
in
the
civil
aeronautics
enterprise
and
be
a
member
of
the
cab
and
never
misuse
his
position
as
a
member
of
the
cab.
it's
(voice
overlap)
that
the
risk
are
shown
by
his
three
or
two
grade.
mr.
archibald
cox
judged
--
judged
in
the
light
of
history
--
industrial
history
or
including
the
things
that
were
available
to
congress
as
a
result
of
the
cio
investigation
of
the
communist
unions
in
1950,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
a
matter
where
the
congress
could
draw
--
it's
a
matter
where
the
congress
could
draw
this
conclusion
from
the
materials
available
to
it,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
the
congress
bases
the
finding
of
crime
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it's
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
just
like
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
just
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
just
as
--
just
as
the
congress
might
pass
a
statute
and
i
don't
think
its
criminal
but
making
it
criminal
for
a
civil
service
employee
to
be
an
officer
of
a
political
party.
the
congress
doesn't
make
anybody
guilty
of
a
crime.
congress
says
they're
doing
certain
things
shall
constitute
a
crime.
and
if
you
don't
do
them
you're
not
criminal.
if
you
do,
you
are.
and
that
as
i
understand
is
true
of
almost
every
regulatory
statute.
it
singles
out
certain
people
to
regulate
and
says
if
you
--
if
the
people
in
this
class
do
certain
things,
they're
guilty
of
crime
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
congress
finds
them
guilty
of
crime.
congress
imposes
the
provision.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
maryland
case
and
in
effect
held
that
that
could
be
done,
didn't
it?
mr.
archibald
cox
wasn't
that
gerende?
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
one
that
--
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
did
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
character
of
the
question
of
the
balance
and
the
issue
i
was
trying
to
focus
attention
on
is
the
same.
i'm
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
opportunities
for
danger
are
exactly
the
same
in
each
instance.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
say
that
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
at
least
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
was
frivolous.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
you
can
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no,
i
take
it
as
that
it
would
be
possible
for
one
to
say
that
to
draw
a
line
between
a
statute
which
forbad
holding
union
office
and
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
same
time
to
say
that
that
was
constitutional
and
to
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
forbid
a
man
to
be
a
union
member
and
the
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
same
time
or
one
could
--
if
he
didn't
draw
the
line
there,
he
could
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
forbid
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
hold
employment
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
member.
i
think
each
of
these
things
must
be
judged
on
its
own
facts
and
that
the
two
alternative
statutes
i've
suggested
would
be
more
vulnerable
than
the
present
statute
because
the
sanction,
the
pressure
to
get
out
of
the
communist
party
would
be
much
greater
and
the
opportunities
to
work
harm
would
be
much
less.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
you
would
prior
--
i
mean
do
it
in
your
decisions
and
you
would
do
it
i
would
urge
if
it
were
to
be
such
a
line
because
you
found
that
the
congress
could
not
reasonably
believe
that
the
danger
--
that
the
harm
a
man
could
do
as
a
result
of
divided
loyalties,
would
be
sufficiently
great
as
a
member
of
a
union
to
justify
what
it
would
be
for
a
far
greater
restriction
on
his
freedom
to
association.
i
think
this
is
the
business
of
drawing
lines
which
as
it
is
often
been
said,
is
the
stuff
of
constitutional
law.
