john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice

m.
harlan
there's
no
good
deal
of
that
fact
to
get
at.
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
was
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
mean
he
was
then

--
do
you
think

of
this

as
a

m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
they
like
him
to
be
a
stockholder
of
a

justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
statute
it
had
been
drawn
in
terms
of
the
smith
act
namely,
that
anyone
who
believed
in
the
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government
could
not
be
an
officer
of
the

what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
just
said
overthrow
the
government.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
of
course
if
this
statute
is
validly
written
that
evidence
was
properly
excluded.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
statute
prevent
him
from
believing
anything?
