mr.
richard
gladstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
quite
agree
with
the
solicitor
that
the
three
basic
issues
presented
here
have
to
do
with
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
this
statute
under
the
first
amendment,
under
the
first
amendment,
and
the
fifth
amendment,
and
under
the
provisions
that
prohibit
the
adoption
of
bills
of
attainder
or
ex
post
facto
laws.
i'm
satisfied
he
is
understating
the
case
when
he
says
that
the
first
amendment
presents
for
him
a
real
troublesome
issue
and
i'm
more
than
satisfied
that
he's
completely
wrong
when
he
characterizes
as
frivolous.
our
contention
that
this
section
504
is
plainly
a
bill
of
attainder,
and
i
am
led
to
believe
that
he
is
not
as
acquainted
as
perhaps
he
ought
to
be
with
what
takes
place
when
a
man
is
indicted,
arraigned
and
tried
in
a
cri
--
court
of
criminal
justice
when
he
says
that
there
is
no,
no
presentation
here
of
serious
questions
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now
this
section,
may
it
please
your
honors,
became
law
on
september
14,
1959.
on
that
day,
my
client
who
had
been
working
as
a
longshoreman
on
the
san
francisco
waterfront
for
nearly
25
years,
was
already
a
member
of
the
executive
board
of
his
local
union,
local
10
of
the
iowu
whose
membership
varied
between
four
and
five
thousand
during
the
period
that
we're
concerned
with.
he
had
been
elected
in
the
november
1958
elections
for
one
year
term
on
a
--
on
a
board
that
comprises
35
working
longshoremen
that
comprise
that
board
plus
six
officers
who
are
not
working
longshoremen
that
is
to
say
they
--
they
work
for
the
union
and
perform
services
for
it,
a
total
therefore
of
41
people.
so
that
when
this
law
was
adopted
by
congress
on
september
14,
1959
and
it
had
as
a
provision
in
it
becoming
effective
of
that
day
that
it
was
a
crime
for
him
to
continue
in
office
as
the
elected
representative
of
the
men
who
had
voted
for
him
in
a
full
and
fair,
and
free
election.
he
was
presented
with
certain
choices.
he,
could
of
course,
and
i
take
it
this
is
what
the
counsel
argues
he
should
have
done.
he
could
have
resigned
from
the
communist
party
but
of
course
that
wouldn't
do
any
good
with
it.
because
the
provision
in
504
says
that
you
may
not
hold
union
office
if
you
are
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
if
you
have
held
such
membership
at
any
time
within
five
years.
so
resigning
from
the
party
would
have
availed
them
nothing.
he
could
of
course
have
resigned
from
the
executive
board
of
the
union.
and
this
apparently
is
what
the
government
thinks
he
should
have
done.
in
doing
so,
he
would
have
surrendered
not
only
his
right
to
continue
to
serve
the
man
who
had
imposed
their
confidence
in
him
and
selected
him
in
a
full
and
fair
election
as
the
man
they
wanted
to
represent
them,
but
he
would
have
also
had
to
surrender
their
right,
wouldn't
he?
because
he
would
have
had
to
frustrate
the
election
process
in
which
the
four
or
five
thousand
members
of
his
union
had
participated
by
saying,
“well,
i
can't
serve
as
your
officer.”
“why
not?”
“well
congress
has
said
i
can't.”
“well
we
decided
that
you
should.”
so
he
remained
until
the
end
of
his
term.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
membership
proposed
him
for
reelection
in
1959
and
he
was
reelected
and
served
for
the
year
1960
and
they
reelected
him
again.
and
he
was
serving
his
third
term
on
the
board
at
the
time
the
indictment
was
returned
in
may
of
1961.
mr.
richard
gladstein
since
what
your
honor?
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
it
happens
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
executive
board
now.
that's
what
--
what
you
want
to
know
now,
he's
not.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
think
he
ran
but
was
defeated
(voice
overlap).
i
think
he
ran
and
was
defeated
your
honor.
mr.
richard
gladstein
now,
it
is
interesting
--
i'll
have
more
to
say
about
this
later.
it
is
interesting
to
hear
an
argument
to
ask
this
court
to
trench
deeply
into
first
amendment
rights
upon
the
basis
that
there
just
is
no
other
way.
congress
has
no
other
way
of
dealing
with
this
terrible
criminal
enterprise
from
which
we
have
so
much
to
fear
and
that's
why
you
have
to
accept
section
504
even
though
it
does
these
additional
things
that
weren't
present
in
9
(h).
you've
just
got
to
let
them
have
it.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
consider
that's
different.
i
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
consider
it
so
and
i
--
i
will
make
an
argument
on
that
subject.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no,
you
can't
(voice
overlap)
well
that's
--
that's
really
different.
that's
the
just
the
same
as
saying
that
the
men
were
sent
to
jail
for
filing
--
for
filing
false
--
for
filing
false
affidavits
under
9
(h).
anybody
can
get
or
sent
to
jail
under
any
statute
for
filing
false
affidavits
with
the
government.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
comparison
between
9
(h)
and
504
for
example
and
i
would
point
out,
i
will
enumerate
point
by
point
the
distinctions
that
chief
justice
vinson
laid
out
in
the
douds
case
which
were
also
noted
by
mr.
justice
black
here
this
morning,
at
least
five
basic
ones
that
distinguish
that
section
and
implied
that
chief
justice
vinson
would
not
have
upheld
section
9
(h)
--
9
(h)
where
--
where
they're
present
those
five
characteristics
that
i
found
in
504.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
i
--
i
grant
that
there
are
contempt
powers.
i
grant
that
there
are
contempt
powers
for
violation
of
the
injunction.
i
would
welcome
and
i
think
anyone
would
welcome
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
a
judge
in
an
injunction
process
where
one
can
present
evidence
that
go
to
the
equities
of
the
case
and
listed
evidence
to
show.
for
example
that
brown
presented
no
threat
whatsoever,
that
his
union
didn't
have
power
to
nor
any
intention
to
call
a
strike,
that
notwithstanding
when
somebody
said
here
before
the
congress
as
to
what
somebody
else
did
15
years
ago
who
was
in
--
in
the
communist
party
that
my
clients
could
produce
evidence.
i
would
be
satisfied
with
that
because
i'm
satisfied
that
the
court
without
a
jury
would
have
not
issued
an
injunction.
but
of
course
if
you
gave
us
a
--
what
you
call
a
jury
trial,
what
they
call
a
jury
trial
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
--
i
don't
understand
you.
i
have
to
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well
if
you
accept
that
then
you
might
as
well
be
very
candid
about
it
and
say
we
won't
have
any
trials
at
all.
why
bother
to
go
through
a
criminal
trial
or
the
injunction
proceeding.
why
not
just
by
edict
either
imprisoned
immediately
all
communist
or
maybe
execute
them
in
the
problem
because
if
what
you
assume,
if
you
--
if
you
have
to
assume
that
they
always
are
going
to
be
under
orders
of
a
foreign
government
if
that's
the
basis
upon
which
you
legislate
then
you
could
never
get
a
fair
trial.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no
sir.
on
the
contrary
i
say
don't
make
any
assumptions.
just
let
archie
brown,
the
defendant
in
this
case
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
have
a
trial
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
i
think
they're
irrelevant
as
far
as
mr.
brown
is
concerned
in
a
criminal
case,
yes.
mr.
richard
gladstein
exactly.
mr.
richard
gladstein
exactly,
because
if
it
were
true
logically,
if
--
if
the
fact
that
a
man
has
been
a
communist
is
enough
to
justify
all
of
the
things
that
read
with
governors,
why
bother
to
have
a
trial.
why
bother
to
have
a
treason
trial,
a
sedition
trial,
or
anything
else?
the
findings
are
going
to
be
made
you
see.
we
must
support
them
or
we
must
recognize
them.
but
if
we
do
that,
the
only
thing
that
happens
is
that
apart
from
the
fact
that
congress
would
be
exercising
--
exercising
the
judicial
authority
in
matters
where
it's
--
the
judiciary
that
should
resolved
this
--
these
things.
but
in
addition,
we
might
just
as
well
forget
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
gladstein
that
was
my
contention
with
--
with
an
alternative.
that
is
to
say
either
that
it
--
it
would
require
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
establish
that
brown
held
union
office
with
the
intent
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
criminal
enterprise
discussed
under
the
smith
act
or
to
--
to
utilize
the
obvious
objective
of
congress
in
504
with
the
intent
of
urging
or
causing
or
developing
political
strikes,
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
congress
was
worried
about
it.
yes,
certainly
that
that
was
an
issue
of
fact
to
be
decided.
the
government's
position
as
it's
here
was
not
only
it
that
not
that
relevant
but
either
an
effort
on
our
part
to
offer
proof
accepting
the
burden
of
the
negative
was
not
relevant
and
therefore
there
was
no
way
by
which
we
get
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes.
but
i've
forgotten
exactly
what
office
he
held.
however,
he
was
the
member
of
the
--
of
the
state
committee
in
california.
he
was
--
and
he
attended
--
there
was
evidence
that
he
had
attended
a
national
committee
meeting
in
the
--
or
convention
in
new
york
city
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
oh
no,
there's
--
there
was
never
any
contention
that
he
was
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
there
was
never
any
contention
but
that
--
that
as
to
whether
he
was
an
active
actual
member
of
a
communist
party.
mr.
richard
gladstein
knowing
what?
mr.
richard
gladstein
knowing
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
yes.
and
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
trial
court
felt
was
always
necessary
that
he
knew
--
that
he
was
knowing
in
the
sense
that
he
knew
he
was
a
member
of
a
party
and
that
he
knew
in
the
sense
that
he
knew
he
was
serving
on
the
executive
board.
however,
as
we
argued
the
knowledge,
the
knowing
aspect
which
makes
criminal
belonging
to
the
party
is
that
which
has
to
do
with
an
intent
or
a
commitment
towards
some
evil
that
the
congress
has
legislated
against,
not
the
mere
fact
of
communist
party
membership
per
se.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
wound
assume
that.
i
would
not
argue
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
would
--
i
would
accept
that.
mr.
richard
gladstein
certainly.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes,
all
i
have
to
do
is
repeat
the
first
amendment,
the
fifth
amendment,
the
provision
on
--
against
bill
--
bills
of
attainder
that
is
as
simple
as
that
mr.
justice
black
and
i
can't
see
any
escape
from
it.
certainly
yes,
certainly
congress
could
have
adopted
the
law
denouncing
as
a
--
as
a
criminal
conspiracy
those
who
engage
in
certain
activities
or
attempt
to
engage
in
them
or
reach
others
to
engage
in
--
but
that
isn't
what
they
did.
and
as
--
as
mr.
justice
black
says,
why
confine
it
to
communists?
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
that
gives
me
trouble
only
in
this
respect.
first,
of
all
it
--
it's
wholly
irrelevant
that
question
but
i
may
say
so
sir
with
all
deference,
for
this
reason,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights
at
all
as
it
is
like
in
the
agnew
case.
we're
not
talking
about
the
conflict
of
interest
situation
whatsoever.
we're
not
talking
about
a
man
who
is
supposedly
placed
in
the
difficult
position
of
choosing
between
the
service
of
--
service
to
two
masters.
we're
not
talking
about
that
at
all.
we're
simply
talking
about
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
that's
right
sir.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes.
mr.
richard
gladstein
because
the
upholding
--
because
the
--
because
if
the
holding
of
officership
in
the
union.
our
argument
is
just
as
much
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
under
the
first
amendment
as
the
holding
of
membership
or
office
of
the
communist
party.
if
i
understood,
mr.
solicitor,
correctly
to
say
this
morning
that
the
first
amendment
protects
a
person
in
this
company
against
const
--
the
congress
putting
him
in
jail
because
he
--
he
becomes
a
member
and
officer
in
the
communist
party.
if
that's
true
then
it
is
my
contention
that
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
say
if
--
if
one
may
have
--
if
one
may
claim
constitutional
protection
to
hold
office
in
the
communist
party
it
is
my
contention
that
i
have
at
least
as
much
constitutional
protection
to
hold
union
office,
office
in
a
union,
an
american
union
one
to
which
my
fellows
elected
me
and
which
is
engaged
in
lawful
pursuits
and
which
is
participating
in
some
of
the
most
important
responsible
politica
--
political
events
in
the
country
why
would
the
constitution
--
why
--
why
should
the
constitution,
the
first
amendment
particularly
give
less
protection
to
me
in
the
holding
of
union
office
or
the
right
to
hold
union
office
if
my
fellow
workman
elect
me
then
it
would
to
somebody
who
is
--
who
is
elected
to
be
a
member
or
an
officer
in
the
communist
party.
now,
if
that's
--
if
--
if
that
argument
is
valid
and
i
submit
under
this
court's
decisions
it
has
to
be
valid.
this
court
has
upheld
again
and
again
the
associational
rights
of
the
naacp
even
though
that
is
not
a
usual
form
of
political
party.
this
court
has
also
upheld
the
individual
rights
of
members
on
individual
records
whether
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
conflicts
as
what
sir?
mr.
richard
gladstein
but
in
a
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
i
don't
think
these
are
questions
that
congress
has
either
any
prerogative
or
--
or
any
expertise
or
even
any
constitutional
right
to
decide
anymore
than
to
say
that
if
i
--
and
i
--
i'm
an
adherent
of
a
particular
religion
and
i
devowed
them
that
this
makes
me
subject
to
the
difficulty
if
i
hold
office,
public
office,
union
office,
that
i
will
be
serving
two
masters
and
not
so
long
ago
i
seemed
to
remember
such
an
argument
being
made
in
the
colloquialism
of
the
street,
the
vernacular
as
to
whether
or
not
our
country
could
afford
a
president
of
the
united
states
who
might
be
placed
in
that
kind
of
situation.
our
constitution
doesn't
recognize
anything
like
that.
and
for
the
same
reason,
for
the
same
reason
if
archie
brown
is
known
to
the
members
of
his
union
as
a
man
who
believes
in
being
a
communist
and
that
appear
apparently
is
his
legal
right
and
apparently
has
run
for
office
on
it.
nobody
has
ever
prosecuted
him
under
the
smith
act
of
anything
else.
and
they
like
him
well
enough
to
want
him
to
be
one
of
the
35
men
on
the
--
on
the
executive
board,
i
don't
think
congress
has
the
slightest
pride
under
the
constitution,
to
tell
them
or
him
anything
about
service
to
two
masters
and
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
but
i
--
a
stockholder
is
not
a
first
amendment
question.
and
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
there
is
that
difference.
i
--
i
don't
like
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
no,
because
then
of
course
his
situation
would
fall
in
the
same
category
as
this
--
these
other
cases
where
a
man
can
disqualify
himself
from
the
right
to
hold
office
or
run
for
office,
remove
himself
so
to
speak
from
that
arena
by
virtue
of
his
own
personal
misconduct
and
all
of
these
cases
where
a
man
have
been
convicted
this
was
the
evidence,
it
was
being
taken
to
support
504,
they've
had
the
judicial
trial.
they
have
the
chance
to
prove
presumably
that
the
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
oh
no
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
no,
he
doesn't.
he
has
never
had
the
chance
to
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
mr.
justice
white,
archie
brown
has
never
even
had
the
chance
to
be
--
to
show
what
--
what
he
was
like
as
an
old
man,
and
now
be
a
new
man.
mr.
richard
gladstein
oh,
well
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
i'm
not
arguing
it
and
i'm
not
required
--
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
situation.
well,
obviously
it's
not
the
situation.
that's
clear
because
he's
never
been
tried
and
convicted
of
anything.
i
guess
that
would
be
an
argument
that
could
be
advanced
to
congress
that
there
ought
to
be
some
kind
of
a
period
of
time
which
to
--
to
let
a
man
show
that
he
has
what
--
done
sufficient
payments
--
payments
accor
--
according
to
congress.
they
seemed
to
think
that
if
a
man
leaves
the
communist
party
and
that's
five
years
passed
that
he
loses
the
taint
and
the
contamination
enough
so
that
there
it's
alright.
and
of
course
as
my
brief
argues,
they
didn't
take
any
evidence
on
that.
i
don't
know
what
they
--
what
--
how
they
established
that.
i
don't
know
how
this
court
would.
i
don't
know
how
you
established
a
thing
like
that.
he
takes
a
wisdom
that
solomon
wouldn't
claim,
5
years,
10,
30,
50,
what
would
the
court
say
if
congress
said,
“well
you
have
to
wait
50
years
after
leaving
the
communist
party
before
you
can
become
a
union
officer.”
it
is
--
it
is
--
i
want
to
make
this
clear.
if
this
statute
abridged
the
rights
of
no
more
than
one
person
in
the
united
states,
that
would
be
sufficient
in
my
view
to
condemn
it.
but
in
as
much
as
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
the
size
of
the
group
effective
is
of
some
moment
it
seems
to
me
the
court
should
appreciate
the
fact
that
you
probably
have
about
a
quarter
of
a
million
to
a
half
million
persons
to
whom
this
section
applies.
and
the
reasons
for
it
are
readily
apparent
when
you
make
a
comparison
between
section
9
(h)
and
section
504.
we
no
longer
have
a
section
which
applies
to
the
officers
of
the
union
and
presumably
if
that's
just
the
titled
officers
of
president,
the
secretary
or
the
treasurer,
we
have
the
section
now
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
have
said
that
if
only
one
person
in
the
united
states
suffers
an
abridgment
of
first
amendment
rights
by
virtue
of
this
statute
that
would
be
enough
to
condemn
it.
but
in
as
much
as
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor
considered
that
the
size
of
the
group
affected
is
of
some
consequence
and
apparently
it
was
to
this
court
in
the
douds
case,
may
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
a
statistic
at
the
government's
brief,
page
42,
note
13
which
tells
us
that
in
1957
there
were
22,405
local
unions
which
had
complied
with
the
9
(h)
non-communist
affidavit
requirement.
this
does
not
tell
us
how
many
officers
there
were
which
--
which
did
so.
we
know
from
our
record
that
there
are
41
officers
and
executive
board
members,
numerous
trustees
and
others
who
fall
within
the
statute.
perhaps
our
locals
are
a
little
larger
than
the
average.
but
if
we
took
as
an
average
ten,
that's
the
president
or
vice
president,
the
secretary,
the
treasurer,
the
sergeant
at
arms,
the
business
agents,
the
organizers,
the
members
of
the
board
of
trustees,
the
members
of
the
executive
board,
ten
a
very
conservative
figure
for
each
of
those
unions.
the
statute
now
would
apply
to
224,000
people
in
the
united
states,
that
however,
that
figure
they
concede
is
inadequate.
first
of
it's
back
in
1957
and
second,
it
didn't
include
the
united
mine
workers
and
the
typographical
workers
union
who
never
did
comply.
we
have
a
figure
that
your
honors
will
find
at
page
20,
note
8
of
our
brief
which
reports
an
announcement
by
the
united
states
department
of
labor
that
is
at
the
beginning
of
this
year,
there
are
52,000
local
trade
unions
in
the
united
states.
if
you
apply
the
same
average
of
ten
again,
very
conservative,
you
have
over
a
half
a
million
men
and
women
to
whom
section
504
is
applicable.
mr.
richard
gladstein
oh,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
aren't
--
it
isn't
applicable
for
this
statute
applies
equally
to
one
who
is
not
a
communist
but
might
wish
to
become
one
tomorrow
or
one
who
is
not
a
communist
today
but
was
one
within
five
years
last
passed
or
one
who
is
a
communist
at
the
present
time.
or
let
me
put
it
to
the
court
differently.
is
it
only
a
significant
thing
that
this
court
should
be
told
that
congress,
laboring
with
this
tremendous
difficulty
solved
it
because
there
was
no
other
way,
no
less
drastic
way
by
means
of
adoption
of
this
statute,
and
yet
we
are
told
that
this
is
the
only
prosecution
under
section
504
that
has
occurred
in
the
united
states
since
the
adoption
of
the
section
in
1959,
well
that's
six
years
ago.
mr.
richard
gladstein
its
none
use.
mr.
richard
gladstein
its
none
use?
mr.
richard
gladstein
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
that
the
inference
is
the
other
way
around.
one
must
assume
therefore
what?
that
archie
brown
is
the
only
person
in
the
united
states
among
half
a
million
who
hold
some
kind
of
union
office
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
that's
an
assumption.
but
again
it's
not
a
fact
that
has
been
proved.
and
that
would
mean
that
the
mere
passage
of
the
law
apparently
is
supposed
to
be
enough
to
--
to
condemn
anyone's
first
amendment
rights.
of
course
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
wasn't
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
of
course,
i
wasn't
looking
for
any
test
case.
i
defended
the
man
who
required
a
defense
because
he
was
indicted,
and
arraigned,
and
was
brought
to
trial.
that
the
government
chose
not
to
prosecute
others
or
perhaps
it
will
answer
mr.
justice
clark's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
the
only
one
in
the
united
states,
i
don't
know.
but
if
it's
true
then
how
--
how
great
must
--
is
this
problem
really
that
the
congress
is
supposed
to
be
struggling
with
that
it
becomes
necessary
to
invade
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no,
nothing
like
that
at
all.
there's
--
there's
nothing
in
the
briefs
or
anywhere
else.
all
that
we
know
is,
insofar
as
we
know
this
is
the
only
case
under
504
involving
the
communist
party.
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
would
think
so
rather
than
wait
and
endanger
the
foundations
of
the
republic
while
a
test
is
going
up
in
the
courts
that
they
would
go
after
everybody
whom
the
fbi
told
them
was
a
member
open
or
concealed
who
also
occupied
union
office.
presumably,
we
certainly
know
that
they
have
such
--
such
informants,
the
one
appeared
in
this
case
and
testified
forth.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
first
understand
clearly
that
the
abridgement
of
the
first
amendment
rights
is
--
is
automatically
achieved
by
this
statute
and
no
better
way
of
showing
that
i
think
exist
than
to
contrast
what
was
said
by
this
court
through
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
douds
case
and
this
statute.
your
honors
will
find
at
pages
38
to
39
of
our
brief
the
five
basic
points
of
difference.
the
first
is
that
under
section
9
(h),
there
was
no
specific
prohibition
against
the
persons
holding
union
office
although
they
were
also
communist
party
members.
no
discharge
in
the
union
office
was
required,
that's
the
first.
here
of
course
the
prohibition
is
absent.
second,
in
the
douds
case,
stress
was
placed
upon
the
fact
that
the
statute
resulted
only
in
an
indirect
conditional
partial
abridgement
of
speech.
that
is
to
say
it
discouraged
membership
in
the
communist
party
to
the
extent
that
labor
unions
might
be
pinched
not
to
elect
the
communist
through
office.
so
the
court
said
that
was
a
partial
unconditioned
--
conditional
and
indirect
abridgment,
a
little
one.
the
third,
douds
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
punishment
involved.
he
said
specifically
9
(h)
does
not
prevent
or
punish
by
criminal
sanctions
the
making
of
speech
or
affiliation
with
any
organization
or
holding
or
any
belief.
well,
of
course
here,
the
communist
party
membership
is
one
of
the
two
elements
of
the
offense.
two
things
that
are
required,
one
is
communist
party
membership
and
the
other
is
the
holding
of
union
office.
so
here
you
have
just
the
opposite
of
douds.
you
have
a
punishment
for
membership
in
an
organization.
fourth,
the
handful
of
people
to
which
douds
applied
was
brought
out
in
this
manner.
the
chief
justice
said
it
touches
only
a
relative
handful
of
persons
living
the
great
majority
of
persons
of
the
identified
affiliations
and
beliefs
completely
free
from
restraint
and
at
least
those
few
who
are
affected,
free
to
maintain
their
affiliations
and
beliefs
subject
only
to
possible
loss
of
position.
now
there,
what
was
being
referred
to
is
the
fact
that
under
9
(h),
the
choice
to
which
the
solicitor
referred
this
morning
inactively
i
may
say
when
he
said
brown
was
given
a
choice.
he
was
not
given
a
choice.
under
9
(h),
a
man
was
given
a
choice.
he
could
disaffiliate
from
the
communist
party
and
remain
a
union
officer.
presumably
congress
was
giving
him
that
choice.
but
here,
the
congress
has
taken
away
that
choice
because
it
has
established
a
five-year
period
during
which
he
is
not
to
be
permitted
despite
this
affiliation
from
the
communist
party
to
be
a
union
officer.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
that
would
--
that
would
do
this.
that
would
allow
if
--
if
there
is
a
reasonable
connection
between
membership
in
a
union
and
overthrow
of
the
government
or
any
entertaining
ideas
about
this
--
about
which
there
would
be
some
question.
but
if
we
came
closer
and
said
--
and
took
the
--
the
congressional
object
here
which
is
to
prevent
political
strikes
which
it
has
said
don't
do
any
good
for
anybody
in
the
country
and
could
only
serve
the
interest
of
the
foreign
power.
alright,
let's
assume
now,
that
congress
to
safeguard
the
channels
of
congress
of
commerce
against
that
threat
as
the
statute
which
said
that
those
who
advocate,
believe
in,
organize
conspire
to
engage
in
political
strikes
however
defined
could
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
even
--
even
that
--
even
that
if
i
were
to
--
if
i
were
to
assume
that
--
if
i
were
to
concede
its
validity
it
wouldn't
be
--
it
would
be
--
it
would
still
mean
section
504.
it
does
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
for
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
this
defendant,
this
individual
on
this
record,
entertained
any
ideas
of
any
kind
or
engaged
in
any
ideas
of
any
kind
that
constitute
criminal
enterprise.
in
other
words,
the
noto
case,
if
i
may
just
with
--
in
the
noto
case,
your
honor
said,
that
it
is
on
a
particular
evidence
in
a
particular
record
that
a
particular
defendant
must
be
tried
and
either
convicted
or
acquitted
and
not
by
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
tenets
of
the
communist
party
or
what's
present
in
some
other
record,
congressional
or
judicial.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes
--
yes,
we
have
a
finding
this
man
was
at
one
time
the
employer's
association
objected
to
his
being
registered
as
a
--
as
a
longshoreman
under
the
claiming
that
his
communist
party
membership
committed
him
to
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
that
that
was
inconsistent
with
concerned
for
private
property
interest.
there
was
an
arbitration
held
before
the
then
dean
of
the
law
school
at
boalt
hall,
captain
keeve,
who
held
on
the
evidence
that
the
case
was
not
made
out
and
that
brown
did
not
believe
him,
was
not
a
member
of
the
party
who
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force.
mr.
richard
gladstein
if
it's
--
well,
if
the
statute
is
validly
written
that
no
evidence
and
this
is
my
complaint
that
no
evidence
is
admissible
to
defend
this
man
against
the
criminal
charge
in
the
criminal
court.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well
yes.
but
if
this
--
if
this
statute
is
valid,
then
the
congress
can
equally
say
that
it
becomes
a
crime
for
a
man
who
is
a
communist
--
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
also
hold
office
in
church.
or
anything
else,
any
other
field
whatsoever,
why
not?
if
one
is
going
to
a
taint,
an
entire
group
which
is
exactly
what
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
and
so
did
mr.
--
the
chief
justice
in
the
douds
case.
and
that
comes
to
the
fifth
point
of
the
distinction
between
9
(h)
and
504.
and
i'm
quoting
the
language
of
the
chief
justice.
he
said
that
the
distinction
was
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
members
of
those
groups
identified
in
9
(h),
are
free
to
serve
as
union
officers,
if
at
anytime
they
renounced
the
allegiances
which
constituted
the
bar
to
signing
the
affidavits
in
the
past,
past
conduct
actual
or
threatened
by
their
previous
adherence
to
affiliations
and
beliefs
mentioned
in
9
(h)
is
not
a
bar
to
resumption
of
the
position.
in
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
unions
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
since
the
basis
of
disqualification
was
past
action
or
loyalty
nothing
that
those
persons
proscribed
by
it's
terms
could
ever
do
would
change
the
result.
here
the
intention
is
to
forestall
future
dangerous
acts.
there
is
no
one
who
may
not
by
voluntary
alteration
of
the
loyalties
which
impel
him
to
action
become
eligible
to
signing
the
affidavit.
well
of
course,
that's
not
true
here
and
that's
why
it
is
eminently
correct
that
the
observations
made
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
are
true.
this
is
a
bill
of
attainder
because
just
like
the
cases
after
the
civil
war
and
just
like
lovett,
there
is
nothing
that
brown
can
do
to
change
the
fact
that
he
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
it's
precisely
for
that
reason
which
the
congress
adopted
this
count.
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
that's
what
she
testified
to.
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
the
--
(voice
overlap)
well,
the
evidence
is
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
executive
board
when
this
act
was
adopted
and
the
evidence
is
that
the
--
that
the
act
was
discussed
and
analyzed
in
the
union
by
the
union
president,
by
the
lawyers
and
all
of
the
correspondents
between
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
union
president's
office
and
our
office
was
made
available
to
the
members
and
they
made
a
decision
that
they
wanted
archie
brown
to
stand
for
reelection.
now,
we
don't
have
evidence
saying
precisely
that
that
this
was
--
this
was
intended
by
the
union
to
be
a
test
case.
that's
what
--
that's
the
only
evidence
of
the
record
mr.
justice
goldberg,
so
i
can't
--
i
can't
say
more
than
that.
now,
what
is
this
bill
of
attainder
that
--
that
this
court
held
in
the
--
in
the
classic
cases?
man
who
had
--
man
who
had
supported
the
southern
states,
the
civil
war
was
told
that
he
couldn't
practice
law
and
unless
he
took
a
note
that
he
had
never
done
so,
something
he
couldn't
change
or
to
be
a
minister
or
anything
else.
and
this
court
laid
--
laid
out
clearly
and
then
the
lovett
case
where
the
pains
and
penalties
were
the
loss
of
salary.
now,
here
i
would
like
to
emphasize
there's
more
than
a
question
of
loss
of
salary.
the
first
amendment
places
this
court
has
said
certain
rights
in
a
preferred
position.
those
rights
are
the
rights
to
freedom
of
speech,
to
freedom
of
the
press,
to
freedom
of
assembly,
to
freedom
of
religion.
of
course,
there
are
rights
to
hold
a
stock
interest
in
corporations
and
--
and
to
earn
a
living
and
to
do
many,
many
other
things.
and
there
are
properly
protections
that
attach
to
those.
but
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
quality
between
these
rights.
the
first
amendment
rights
are
the
most
important
in
the
life
of
a
free
nation.
and
therefore,
the
congress
may
not
because
there
is
a
ban
in
the
first
amendment.
the
congress
may
not
adopt
the
statute
which
abridges
those
rights.
now,
my
client,
this
court
has
held
that
to
be
a
communist
is
merely
an
exercise
of
his
constitutional
right.
he
could
be
foolish,
unwise,
full
hearty,
whatever
it
is.
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
foolish
then
by
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
without
more
as
long
as
that
party
does
participate
in
some
lawful
activities
or
had
some
lawful
purposes.
as
long,
in
other
words,
as
it
is
then
found
to
be
in
fact,
nothing
but
a
criminal
enterprise
in
and
of
itself.
similarly,
my
client
is
a
member
of
an
officer
of
a
trade
union.
i
have
urged
in
the
brief
and
have
said
here
earlier
today
certainly,
a
man
who
is
a
member
of
a
trade
union
has
as
much
right
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
of
our
constitution
to
hold
office
in
that
union
as
he
has
to
be
a
communist.
now,
if
that's
true
how
can
congress
by
taking
speech
and
adding
it
to
speech
say
that
it's
going
to
forbid
the
man
from
doing
one
or
other
on
pain
of
a
surrendering
at
least
one
and
not
even
giving
him
a
chance
to
make
the
surrender.
it's
exactly
what
it
amounts
to.
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
government
has
to
concede
that
if
this
is
true,
if
that's
all
there
it
is,
speech
plus
speech
remains
speech
then
the
statute
is
dead
and
should
be
declared
so
by
the
court.
this
statute
is
condemned
by
the
first
amendment.
this
is
why
they
urged
your
honors
to
distinguish
the
statute
from
the
smith
act
cases
and
others
by
calling
it
conduct
intertwined
with
expression
of
speech.
and
they
cite
in
this
court's
recent
decision
earlier
this
term
cox
against
louisiana
which
involved
a
leader
of
some
2000
people
who
picketed
in
or
near,
near
a
courthouse
and
interfered
with
judicial
proceedings.
and
there
this
court
held
that
louisiana
could
properly
regulate
such
conduct
because
it
was
conduct,
it
was
picketing.
now,
they
claim
there
is
an
analogy
and
we
say
now
that
we
--
we
can't
--
we
ask
where
is
the
analogy
between
archie
brown
sitting
down
at
the
executive
board
meeting
of
this
union
with
the
other
35
members
to
discuss
some
union
business
and
the
man
who
leads
2000
pickets
of
--
near
a
courthouse.
and
your
honor
asked
me,
do
i
--
do
i
consider
that
injunctions
and
the
proceedings
would
be
different?
yes,
certainly
because
there,
he
would
be
receiving
an
order
to
show
cause
and
it
would
be
directed
toward
him
and
he
would
have
a
hearing
at
which
he
could
offer
evidence
concerning
what
he
believes,
what
he
stands
for,
and
it
would
be
on
the
basis
of
that
where
a
judge
would
decide
whether
he
should
be
enjoined
in
order
to
keep
him
away
from
union
meeting.
it's
my
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
it
prevents
him
from
engaging
in
--
yes,
it
does.
it
prevents
him
from
engaging
in
his
associational
rights
with
his
members
on
the
executive
board.
to
that
extent
it
does.
if
free
--
if
the
assembly
of
people
in
association
with
each
other
for
the
purpose
of
exercising
together
free
speech
and
free
press
is
a
first
amendment
right
then
certainly
it
does.
well,
of
course
it
doesn't
prevent
him
from
speaking
on
the
privacy
of
his
home
but
it
prevents
him
from
speaking
at
the
executive
board
meeting
as
an
officer.
no,
that's
the
first
amendment
point
and
the
bill
of
attainder
point.
i
want
to
say
about
the
fifth
amendment
point
simply
this.
there's
--
this
is
a
criminal
case.
there
was
this
man
who
was
indicted.
he
was
arraigned.
there
are
certain
safeguards
that
our
constitution
provides
for
a
criminal
case.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
--
to
perceive
the
--
this
distinction
that
is
made
or
--
by
a
counsel
that
sort
of
assures
that
if
the
congress'
laboring
with
the
problem,
well
then
what
difference
does
it
make
what
form
of
force
they
used.
i
supposed
that
we
must
concede
that
not
only
as
a
matter
of
philosophy
it's
desirable
that
the
government
--
well,
that
that
government
rules
best
which
rules
least
but
also
that
consistent
with
our
constitution,
there
are
things
which
the
congress
may
not
do.
and
the
reason
they
may
not
do
is
not
because
this
court
says
or
anybody
else,
but
because
the
constitution
which
was
adopted
by
the
people
says
so.
now,
they
make
certain
arguments
that
this
statute
must
be
treated
as
though
congress
is
merely
concerned
with
--
with
a
special
unique
position
regard
to
trade
unions.
and
they
say
that
unions
occupy
kind
of
a
unique
position
in
our
country.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
claim
that
they
even
use
the
expression
that
unions
are
vessels
of
national
economic
policy.
we
challenge
that.
we
think
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
with
all
deference
is
the
vehicle
or
vessel
or
servant
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
and
that
every
arm
of
government
in
whom
power
is
given
and
entrusted,
it's
for
the
purpose
of
serving
the
needs
and
requirements
and
desires
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
such
at
least
is
the
form
of
our
government.
and
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
say
that
congress
has
some
special
responsibility
in
regard
to
trade
unions.
they,
as
our
brief
shows,
existed
before
congress
ever
was
convened
existed
in
this
country.
and
they
developed
out
of
special
and
peculiar
conditions
of
american
conditions
and
developments,
and
the
right
of
men
to
join
together
and
form
in
unions
antedates
congress.
and
certainly
it's
embraced
within
the
rights
of
freedom
of
speech,
press,
assembly
and
association
contained
in
the
first
amendment,
and
that
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
i
--
i
would
again
say
that
the
congress
by
its
legislation
can
influence
in
one
direction
or
another,
no
question
about
it.
and
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
complaining
that
the
congress
undertakes
to
protect
--
to
protect
against
abuses.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it's
a
mistake
to
think
that
because
congress
has
done
so,
therefore
the
unions
and
union
members
are
in
the
position
where
they
don't
have
a
right
to
complain
about
constitutional
rights
being
taken
away,
that's
the
point.
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
he
has
to
say
this
court
has
--
oh,
i
think
this
court
has
plainly
said
in
the
recent
railroad
brotherhood
case,
the
virginia
case,
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
before
the
court
plainly
holds
that
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
railroad
union
i
guess
that
would
cover
the
longshoremen's
union
too.
those
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment
just
as
much
as
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
naacp
in
the
cases
this
court
has
decided
there
and
in
respect
of
other
organizations
as
long
as
these
are
organizations
of
people
who
are
engaged
in
lawful
activity
for
legitimate
purposes
this
is
what
a
democratic
participation
on
the
part
of
the
people
and
our
type
of
government
means.
now,
if
we
are
fearful
of
abuses
of
privilege
then
as
chief
justice
hughes
said
in
the
de
jonge
case
for
unanimous
court
deal
with
the
abuses.
let
--
let
the
congress
curtail
the
abuses
but
not
curtail
the
rights
which
it
does
when
it
says
you
can't
be
an
officer.
let
congress
adopt
the
law
that
says
that
you
can't
do
this
that
or
the
other
thing
while
being
an
officer
of
the
union.
let
it
say
whether
it's
a
communist
or
not
communist
that
nobody
has
a
right
to
--
to
hold
office
in
a
union
who
believes
in
the
overthrow
of
our
form
of
government
by
unconstitutional
or
any
other
means
or
who
believes
in
the
destruction
of
private
property
or
something
else
which
is
clearly
within
the
province
of
the
congress
or
legislator
but
not
simply
by
taking
a
position,
a
status
because
that
is
a
bill
of
attainder.
it
obtains
all
of
the
people
who
have
ever
belonged.
the
argument
that
congress
had
no
other
way,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
think
that
in
a
country
whose
resources
are
so
vast
which
has
at
its
--
at
its
command
unlimited
resources
both
of
personnel
and
wealth
to
acquaint
the
government
with
all
information
necessary
as
to
the
existence
or
nonexistence
or
tendency
of
a
danger
of
a
political
strike.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
believe
or
should
this
court
accept
in
the
absence
of
some
evidence
that
no
other
way
lies
open
than
to
--
than
to
pass
a
law
which
amounts
to
amending
the
first
--
amendments
of
the
constitution
for
this
reason.
we
have
fbi.
we
have
all
kinds
of
police
officers
and
agencies.
we
have
men
who
represent
and
constitute
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities.
we
know
from
experience,
we
know
from
this
record
that
we
have
both
professional
and
volunteer
informants
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party
presumably
the
same
thing
is
true
in
unions.
nobody
could
question
of
that
any
government
has
the
right
in
the
interest
of
self-preservation
to
make
known
to
itself
to
keep
up
with
all
of
the
information
that's
relevant
to
self-preservation,
and
presumably
that's
done.
well
then
how
or
why
is
it
necessary
to
adopt
a
law
without
any
foundation
in
fact
with
all
of
these
assumptions
creates
a
conclusive
irrefutable
presumption
that
my
client
no
matter
what
the
evidence,
no
matter
what
the
proof
must
be
condemned
as
a
criminal
if
he
wants
to
remain
a
union
officer?
the
argument
is
an
unrealistic
one.
it
is
one
that's
concocted,
it
is
one
that
is
not
in
accord
with
facts
and
for
the
best
--
the
best
answer
was
to
a
question
that
was
asked,
was
the
congress
presented
with
anything
new
in
adopting
the
1959
provision?
and
the
answer
is
no.
it
all
goes
back
to
the
allis-chalmers,
and
north
american
strike
situations
about
which
testimony
was
given
back
in
the
1947.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
504
is
to
be
upheld,
this
court
would
then
have
to
close
its
eyes
to
holdings
in
its
own
opinions
case
after
case,
these
are
listed
in
our
brief.
we're
dealing
with
criminal
cases
we
remind
your
honors
of
these
cases
where
in
a
particular
trial
involving
a
particular
person
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
no
criminal
conviction
has
been
sustained
in
the
absence
of
satisfactory
proof
of
personal
activity
on
his
parts
which
shows
personal
approval
of
some
criminal
enterprise,
personal
effort
subscribing
personally
some
--
to
some
activity
or
something
that
congress
could
necessarily
and
properly
legislate
against
as
an
evil.
this
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
and
the
statute
doesn't
permit
it.
the
statute
contains
an
ipse
dixit.
it
merely
says
that
we
would
use
the
names
and
that
will
be
sufficient.
and
as
we
say
in
effect
that
is
transferring
the
trial
of
brown
to
the
halls
of
the
congress
and
trying
him
in
abstentia
without
any
evidence
that
relates
to
him
and
then
saying
you
do
not
dare
to
be
a
union
member.
i
don't
think
it's
fanciful
for
me
to
say
as
i
have
that
if
the
congress
can
apply
this
five-year
provision,
it
can
apply
a
30-year
provision,
i
mean
what's
the
difference?
where
is
the
evidence
that
justifies
five?
where
was
the
evidence
that
justified
the
congress
in
adopting
this
in
section
504.
it
wasn't
in
section
9
(h).
it
was
one
of
the
points
that
chief
justice
vinson
made
so
forcibly.
he
said
there's
nothing
that
anybody
can't
do
simply
by
changing
his
allegiance
and
wants
to
just
affiliate
from
the
communist
party.
that
no
longer
is
true.
i
have
some
comments
of
the
solicitor.
it
is
true
that
it
is
--
his
duty
i
certainly
and
the
last
person
to
raise
any
question
of
criticizing
it
or
suggesting
what
his
duty
is
but
as
--
as
he
--
said
it's
that
the
solicitor's
duty
to
certainly
make
out
of
whatever
defense
can
be
made
for
congressional
enactment
but
it
is
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
too
to
see
to
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rights
of
the
people
under
the
--
under
the
constitution
are
defended
that
has
been
done
mr.
justice
goldberg's
opinion
in
the
recent
case
quotes
testimony
given
by
mr.
pickford
when
he
was
an
assistant
attorney
general
who
made
clear
in
a
--
when
a
bill
--
when
a
bill
of
the
same
kind
was
being
considered
said
that
it
was
not
good
policy
and
would
--
would
probably
be
unconstitutional
to
condemn
and
apply
criminal
punishment
against
a
man
where
there's
no
evidence
allowed
or
required
to
show
anything
done
by
him
that
shows
criminal
intent
or
criminal
activity.
i
think
that
is
true
here.
i
do
not
understand
the
argument
that
504
is
a
lesser
infringement
than
9
(h).
and
i
think
that
the
solicitor
was
compelled
in
fact
virtually
to
abandon
that
position
when
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
quotation
from
the
prior
brief
where
the
brief
pointed
out
in
9
(h)
that
criminal
punishment
at
an
absolute
ban
would
be
more
drastic,
he
had
to
concede
that
that
was
the
government's
position
then.
now,
apparently
i
don't
know
how
he
can
consider
that
504
is
a
lesser
infringement,
if
it
puts
a
man
in
jail
for
holding
a
union
office
when
9
(h)
did
not
do
so
and
didn't
require
him
to
do
anything
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
turning
things
upside
down
to
suggest
that
it's
a
lesser
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
pardon?
mr.
richard
gladstein
not
unless
you
want
--
if
that
is,
he
could
file
--
if
he
wants
to
be
truthful,
he
could
file
an
affidavit
by
disaffiliating
or
if
he
wants
not
to
file
the
affidavit,
he
didn't
have
to.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no
(voice
overlap),
oh
no,
he
didn't
have
to
at
all.
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
that
if
he
didn't
the
local
union
or
the
union
whatever
it
was
to
which
he
belonged
was
not
permitted
access
to
the
labor
board
facilities.
mr.
richard
gladstein
that's
very
different
thing
however
from
imprisonment
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes,
that's
what
the
congress
did
and
--
mr.
richard
gladstein
well,
they
could
prosecute
anybody
under
any
circumstances
for
filing
a
false
affidavits,
certainly,
that
that's
--
that's
not
material
to
the
point
here.
i'm
not
contending
that
anybody
has
the
right
to
--
to
file
a
false
affidavit
or
that
there
shouldn't
be
criminal
punishment
for
filing
a
false
affidavit.
on
the
contrary,
criminal
punishment
should
be
imposed
precisely
for
criminal
conduct
and
my
complaint
is
that
there
is
no
criminal
conduct
here.
and
criminal
punishment
is
being
imposed.
that's
my
point,
that
there
is
opposition,
that
there
is
something
that
somebody
said
before
the
congress
as
to
what
supposed
to
have
taken
place
in
1948
somewhere
in
pittsburgh.
and
my
client
who
lives
in
san
francisco
and
works
there
wants
to
know
why
he
has
to
go
to
jail
because
somebody
said
something
before
the
congress
and
without
being
given
the
chance
to
meet
any
claim
that
he
has
done
anything
wrong
except
to
be
what,
a
communist?
this
court
has
said
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
one.
except
to
be
what?
a
union
officer?
you
come
very
close
to
saying
just
recently
that
if
the
right
to
be
a
union
member
is
a
first
amendment
right
and
you
said
so,
you
have
the
right
to
select
once
--
once
leaders
is
part
of
the
union
members
rights,
well
then
it's
a
--
it's
a
necessary
corollary
isn't
it
that
it's
a
part
of
that
constitutional
right
for
the
man
to
stand
for
office
and
if
elected
take
it.
now,
if
that's
in
the
first
amendment
what
have
we
done?
we
have
allowed
the
congress
under
this
law
to
say,
“it's
alright
if
you
want
to
use
this
first
amendment
right
but
only
that
one.”
“oh,
it's
alright
if
you
want
to
use
this
first
amendment
right,
that's
alright,
but
only
that
one.
but
don't
try
and
use
them
both.”
i
don't
understand
that
the
congress
has
been
given
that
kind
of
authority
and
that's
what
this
section
amounts
to.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no,
no.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes.
there
would
--
there's
testimony
by
four
long
time
leaders
of
the
union
who
had
known
brown
and
knew
him
by
reputation
on
the
waterfront
as
a
communist,
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
that
he
had
never
made
any
secret
of
it
and
that
those
references
are
--
you'll
find
references
in
our
brief.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes.
it
was
af
--
well
of
course
that
they
--
this
is
part
of
our
defense
and
she
testified
for
the
prosecution.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no
--
no
issue
on
that.
mr.
richard
gladstein
no
issue
was
ever
made
of
that
on
the
contrary
if
the
outset
where
i
said
that
we
--
we
made
no
issue
of
that.
he
--
he
had
been
known
and
in
fact
ran
for
the
--
ran
for
office
as
a
communist
trying
to
be
elected
governor
of
the
state
of
california
on
one
occasion.
mr.
richard
gladstein
yes
sir.
they
--
they
are
this.
i
--
your
honor
will
find
a
reference
to
the
testimony.
i
didn't
call
that
out
in
my
brief
but
it'll
be
very
close
to
the
portions
that
i
do
have
in
the
statement
at
page
4,
the
bottom
--
and
at
top
of
page
5
your
honors,
will
find
references
to
pages
173,
184,
190,
and
193
where
his
reputation
for
--
his
good
reputation
for
law
abidingness
was
given
by
four
witnesses
who'd
known
him
for
20
or
25
years
and
they
too
testified
some
if
not
all
that
he's
reputation
also
was
that
he
was
known
and
widely
known
as
a
communist.
now,
i
think
i
can
conclude
by
--
by
pointing
out
what
the
breadth
of
the
statute
really
means.
i'm
not
bothered
to
call
the
court's
attention
of
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
so
wide
of
any
mark
that
congress
really
is
--
has
the
right
to
try
--
to
do.
it
is
so
far
from
re
--
being
a
real
effort
to
try
to
come
to
grips
of
the
problem.
that
there's
even
a
provision
that
it's
a
crime
for
a
man
to
work
for
general
motors
as
a
labor
--
labor
consultant
if
he's
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
last
five
years.
now,
it
of
course
it
doesn't
make
it
a
crime
for
general
motors
but
it
is
a
crime
for
somebody
to
be
a
labor
consultant
or
employee
for
various
organizations,
employer
associations
that
deal
with
unions.
now,
how
ridiculous
can
it
be?
what
could
there
have
been
to
justify
something
like
that.
if
general
motors
wants
to
hire
somebody
who's
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
maybe
precisely
because
if
he
has
--
he
has
some
expertise
about
things
like
that
in
the
union.
why
he
shouldn't
have
the
right
to?
not
that
i
--
they
haven't
hired
me
to
make
this
argument
but
it
is
true
that
this
statute
bends
it.
i
submit
that
under
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
this
statute
goes
farther.
so
far
as
i
know
that
any
in
the
history
of
the
country,
it
is
a
dangerous
and
pernicious
type
of
statute.
it
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
this
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
i
ask,
your
honors,
to
do
the
same
and
in
addition
to
name
it
for
what
it
is
so
that
proper
guidance
can
be
given
that
it's
a
biil
of
attainder
and
an
ex
post
facto
law
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
we
have
vital
interest
in
this
country
of
course.
but
it's
not
only
the
solicitor
and
congress
who
have
those
interests
to
support,
to
defend,
the
people
do
too.
and
that
includes
the
right
to
participate
in
the
political
life
of
the
nation
which
includes
the
trade
unions
and
the
other
organizations
of
the
people.
certainly,
punished
for
crime,
certainly
stop
the
political
strike,
the
minute
it
gets
going,
if
--
if
that's
what
we
don't
want,
if
there's
a
law
against
it,
we
have
ways
of
doing
that.
the
president
has
powers.
mr.
richard
gladstein
president
has
the
powers
to
enjoin,
intercept
and
take
all
kinds
of
steps
to
prevent
the
threatened
danger
which
is
being
used
an
excuse
for
abridging
first
amendment
rights.
thank
you.
