do
you
believe
this
would
be
so
whether
this
contract
is
agreed
or
concurred
on
the
field
of
coal
they
were
brought
to?

(inaudible)

and
the
third
reason.
justice

j.

mr.
heymann,
you
say
the
government
wants
to
decide
this
case
and
the
economic
reality
and
so
we
see
to
it
that
the
high
paying
taxpayer
doesn't
get
the
deduction
and
low
paying
taxpayer
in
fact
does
but
isn't
the
practical
result
of
the
government's
position
quite
in
reverse
and
let
show
this
to
you.
that
your
equality
of
bargaining
power
here
that
you
have
read
from
the
record
demonstrates
there
is
none
if
you
take
the
same
arrangement
and
make
a
royalty.
because
after
all
the
miners
aren't
going
to
get
paid
unless
paragon
sells
and
sale
as
you
have
said
the
amount
that
it
paid
really
comes
out
of
the
process
of
sale
because
they
could
terminate
the
contract
if
they're
not
going
to
get
enough
to
pay
the
miner
and
in
that
result
aren't
the
government
looking
in
your
form
here
in
that
substance.
justice
arthur

but
he
has
no
bargaining
power
to
do
that.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
would
--
why
would
it
be
different?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
you're
demonstrating
just
that
he
doesn't
have
any
quality
of
bargaining
power.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you're
saying
the
same
thing.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you're
saying
that
the
miner
does
not
have
the
bargaining
power
which
would
give
him
the
totality
the
royalties
that
you
think
are
