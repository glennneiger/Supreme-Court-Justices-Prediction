justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
going
to
make
me
any
real
difference
that
government
in
terms
of
money
collected
in
terms
of
revenue
in
which
way
this
case
comes
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
certainly
taking
a
rather
solid
position
on
this
--
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
it
must
have
--
means
something
to
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we're
going
to
go
in
economic
reality,
that
isn't
quite
the
argument
of
your
lessee?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
say
--
say
that
the
coal
company
leases
to
an
operator,
puts
the
word
lease
on
the
top
of
it
because
i'll
buy
all
your
coal
at
reasonable
sum
in
the
lease
is
for
five
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
normally
the
lessees
share
in
depletion?
justice
byron
r.
white
depletion.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
lessee
--
but
if
the
lessee
is
selling
on
the
open
market
prices
and
he
negotiates,
agrees
to
sell
to
the
lessor
with
reasonable
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
--
you
think
this
contract
--
i
gathered
you
thought
this
contract
might
at
least
mean
that
the
owner
was
agreeing
to
pay
reasonable
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
rule
would
have
considerable
application
outside
the
mineral
business
too,
i
suppose.
i
mean
outside
oil
--
in
the
oil
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
a
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
the
term
in
their
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
you
say
the
fact
that
paragon
himself
didn't
put
out
any
money
in
developing
this
coal
and
that
the
contract
operator
did,
that
the
contract
operator
were
one
of
the
economic
interest
rather
than
paragon?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
case
will
be
stronger
or
weaker
if
there
was
a
fair
price
in
sale
of
coal
to
some
of
your
clients
to
paragon?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
more
discretion
--
the
more
discretion
you
give
the
buyer
to
set
the
price,
the
stronger
your
case
is
for
economic
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
contract,
let's
say
it
depends
on
the
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
--
you
just
said
a
word,
why
do
you
think
parsons
had
no
control
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
because
there
were
strip
miners
involved
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
capital
investment
was
the
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
it
wasn't
the
equipment
or
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whereas
in
a
strip
mining
operation
the
more
overburdened
area
is
the
closer
that
gets
to
break
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it's
measurable
or
not,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
important
to
getting
ready
to
mine
and
remove
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
thus
in
strip
mining
that's
quite
a
bit
of
overburden
to
remove,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
was
enough
--
if
there
was
enough
that
had
to
be
removed
in
order
to
sort
of
like
timber
that's
stripped,
you're
really
getting
ready
to
mine
and
the
more
of
that
there
is
most
likely
parts
he
would
control
even
though
he
is
a
strip
miner?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
these
levels
straight
or
are
they
slanted?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
shaft?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
the
--
it's
the
--
it's
the
labor
that
takes
to
put
the
mine
in
shape?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
rail
was
it
that
was
laid?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
rail
is
it's
mine
isn't
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
rail
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
--
are
these
development
costs
in
this
contract
that
these
miners
put
in
i
suppose
are
deductible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
say
1950.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
deductible
against
straight
income
from
mining.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they're
carry
over
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
forward
or
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
straight
ordinary
deduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
those
kind
of
investments
which
your
total
investment
are
deductible
on
a
formal
basis
or
an
economic
interest
so
that
you
can
deduct
it
in
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
oppose
that
--
can
the
coal
mining
business,
can
you
elect
cost
depletion?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
elected
that
way
you
would
have
include
in
your
base
the
development
cost,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you're
already
deducting
them
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
never
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
as
part
of
the
capital
