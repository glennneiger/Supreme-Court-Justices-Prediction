mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
comes
out
in
favor
of
the
mineral
lessee,
paragon
in
this
case,
and
opposed
to
the
depletion
claims
of
merritt,
the
contract
miners.
we
believe
that
that
conclusion
is
dictated
by
the
purpose
of
depletion
allowance.
depletion
is
the
deduction
that
congress
allows
taxpayers
so
that
they
can
recover
the
value
of
a
mineral
deposit
in
the
ground.
it
differs
from
all
other
tax
relationships
and
that
it
turns
on
value,
not
cost
but
it's
recover
the
value
to
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
what
wasn't
true,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
justice
douglas,
that
depends
on
how
you
define
owner
and
i
will
get
to
that
very
shortly.
okay,
the
simplest
way
of
explaining
what
depletion
is,
is
to
look
to
its
immediate
predecessor
discovery
depletion.
ideally
what
we
would
do
is
we
would
value
the
value
of
a
mine,
the
mineral
deposit
in
the
ground.
let's
say
that
$60,000.
we
would
determine
how
many
units
would
come
out
of
that
mine
but
say
100,000
units,
and
then
we
would
divide
one
into
the
other
and
we
would
conclude
that
you
got
60
cents
tax-free
recovery
every
unit
you
sell.
if
you
have
a
mine
worth
$60,000
coal
mine,
if
we
can
--
if
we
could
figure
out
you're
going
to
go
100,000
tons
of
coal
out
of
the
mine,
we
would
allow
--
we
would
figure
that
the
coal
was
worth
60
cents
a
ton
in
the
mine
and
when
you
sold
it
for
$6
a
ton,
we
would
allow
you
a
tax-free
recovery
of
60
cents
a
ton.
this
very
system
discovery
depletion
was
used
for
many
years
it
was
--
it
has
now
been
completely
replaced
by
percentage
depletion
simply
as
a
matter
of
administrative
convenience.
congress
now
says
in
the
case
of
coal
that
it
arbitrarily
assumes
that
10%
of
the
sale
--
sales
price
of
a
ton
of
coal
after
it
has
been
washed
and
cleaned
and
graded
represents
the
value
in
the
ground.
the
ton
of
coal
sells
for
$6,
congress
figures
60
cents
as
the
value
in
the
ground
and
they're
going
to
give
that
back
to
the
taxpayer
tax-free.
you're
going
to
allow
them
to
recover
that
out
of
your
sales
tax-free.
the
very
nature
of
depletion
and
here
justice
douglas,
i'm
getting
to
your
question
dictates
that
the
deduction
goes
to
the
owner
of
valuable
rights
in
mineral
in
the
ground.
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
too
free
in
saying
where
i
agree
and
where
i
disagree
with
colonel
wiener
because
i'm
not
100%
sure
that
i'm
certain.
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
government
doesn't
care
whether
its
property
rights
in
the
ground
or
contract
rights
for
one
thing.
many
of
the
early
cases
involved
are
contract
right
to
receive
retain
by
the
owner
of
lands
who
leased
the
coal
and
under
state
law
the
lease
was
equivalent
to
a
sale
of
all
the
coal.
they
retained
a
right
to
a
royalty
of
certain
number,
actually
they're
oil
case
a
certain
number
of
dollars
a
barrel
that
was
held
to
be
a
depletable
interest.
the
government
has
moreover
for
many
years
allowed
a
purchase
of
such
an
interest.
the
taxpayer
comes
along
and
pays
$200,000
for
a
royalty
interest
of
$4
a
ton
in
coal
or
$4
a
barrel
in
oil.
he
will
obtain
and
running
to
exhaustion,
he
will
obtain
a
depletable
interest.
we
say
he
has
bought
in
to
the
value
of
the
mineral
deposit
in
the
ground
and
we
don't
care
whether
he
gets
legal
title
under
property
law
or
not.
now,
in
southwest
exploration,
the
court
held
that
these
men
were
necess
--
that
the
uplands
landowners
were
necessary
to
the
mineral
--
into
the
mining,
but
if
--
i
just
take
one
step
--
i
just
take
step
one
step
back,
the
one
case
this
court
hasn't
decided
is
whether
you
can
buy
a
net
profits
interest
in
a
mining
business,
whether
you
can
buy
an
interest,
whether
you
can
spend
$200,000
and
get
a
right
to
a
quarter
of
the
profits
from
a
coal
mining
or
an
oil
production
business.
if
you
take
a
royalty,
if
you
take
$4
a
ton,
at
least
the
government
isn't
firm
on
this.
if
you
take
a
$4
a
ton
or
if
you
take
1/8
of
the
oil
out
of
the
ground,
this
can
be
bought
and
sold
and
you
get
a
depletable
interest,
whether
that
would
happen
with
net
profits
nobody
knows.
southwest
explorations
are
net
profits
case.
the
government
came
into
this
court
and
argued
that
we
believe
that
a
person
can
spend
$200,000
and
buy
net
profits
interest
in
a
mineral
business
and
he
should
be
entitled
to
the
depletion
because
he's
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
the
difficult
case
that
lurks
behind
here
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
come
out
pretty
clearly
and
squarely
on
paragon.
now,
i
really
never
got
to
my
argument
yet.
the
difficult
case
that
lurks
behind
here
is
the
one
that
you're
moving
towards.
i'm
sure
colonel
wiener
would
not
agree
with
me.
i
think
the
government
would
say
that
if
a
man
came
and
promised
to
mine
5000
tons
of
coal
in
exchange
for
1/8
royalty
interest
in
the
coal
field,
he
would
get
a
depletable
interest.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
cash.
now,
that's
the
difficult
case
that
lurks
behind
and
my
explanation
will
be
that
that
is
the
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
exactly
right,
justice
stewart.
it's
possible
though
to
promise.
the
difficulty
is
that
it
is
at
least
conceivable.
we
haven't
seen
the
depletion
case
yet
but
it's
conceivable
that
in
exchange
for
promise
of
services,
you
would
take
out
an
economic
interest
in
a
mineral.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
exactly.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
exactly.
and
that's
why
the
notion
of
capital
investment
that
mr.
merrell
emphasizes
so
much
in
his
brief
is
to
us
largely
a
question,
largely
a
read
hearing.
we
don't
care
how
much
you
spend.
you
can
be
given
a
depletable
interest
and
you
get
a
depletable
interest.
we
care
what
you
take
out
of
a
transaction
and
not
what
you
put
into
a
transaction.
well,
i
had
said
that
the
very
nature
of
depletion
drives
you
back
to
owner
and
i
have
said
that
by
owner
we
mean
owner
of
legally
enforceable
rights
to
share
in
the
value
of
the
mineral
deposit.
they
can
be
contract
rights,
they
can
bee
property
rights,
they
can
be
purchased,
they
can
be
given,
you
have
to
have
legally
enforceable
rights.
our
first
position
in
this
case
and
the
only
one
we
argued
in
our
brief
is
that
there
in
the
case
of
contract
miner
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
don't
--
yes,
your
honor
unless
you
have
any
questions.
we
don't
have
any
problem
with
southeast
--
southwest
exploration.
we
would
think
the
decision
were
correct
on
a
broader
ground
and
we
think
it's
on
and
we
think
it's
very
clearly
correct
on
a
narrow
ground.
now,
we
urge
the
broader
ground
that
that
case
is
an
alternative.
we
think
there
is
plainly
depletable
interest
in
the
huntington
upland
owners
in
that
case.
in
the
case
of
contract
miners,
we
think
that
there
are
two
minimum
conditions
and
as
i'll
go
on
to
say
we
don't
think
these
are
sufficient.
they're
just
necessary.
they're
minimum
conditions
to
getting
the
depletable
interest.
one
is
that
the
contract
miners'
rights
must
not
be
terminable
at
the
will
of
the
mineral
lessee.
merritt's
rights
must
not
be
terminable
at
the
will
of
paragon.
a
man
doesn't
have
any
legally
enforceable
rights
to
share
in
the
value
of
a
mineral
asset
if
he
can
be
cut
off
at
the
will
of
someone
else
who
then
takes
over
his
rights.
i
don't
think
that
requires
any
belaboring.
the
second
condition
which
we
think
is
equally
clear
is
that
a
man
has
no
legally
enforceable
rights
to
share
in
the
value
of
a
mineral
deposit
in
the
grounds
if
he
has
--
if
he's
obligated
to
sell
it
to
another
man
at
a
price
set
by
that
other
man.
now,
if
i
own
a
diamond
mine
and
i
give
mr.
smith
a
right
to
withdraw
all
the
diamonds
he
wishes
and
merely
limit
him
to
selling
to
me
at
a
price
set
by
me,
he
has
obtained
no
valuable
right,
no
legally
enforceable
rights
to
share
in
the
value
of
the
diamonds.
i'm
going
to
set
my
--
i
at
least
have
a
right.
i
should
be
careful
how
i
say
that.
i
at
least
have
a
right
to
set
my
price
at
the
value
of
the
services.
now,
one
thing
is
if
i'm
an
enlightened
businessman,
i'm
going
to
pay
them
more
than
the
value
of
the
services.
i'm
going
to
try
to
keep
them
happy.
i'm
not
going
to
want
turnover
and
i
may
be
enlightened
enough
that
i'm
going
to
let
him
share
in
good
times
and
cut
him
back
in
bad
times.
justice
goldberg
asked
about
the
investment
in
this
case.
he
asked
about
the
$30,000
investment
that
one
miner
made
in
a
relationship
with
another
miner
in
a
situation
where
we
put
where
we
--
i'm
about
to
argue.
we
think
that
the
price
can
be
set
completely
by
paragon
as
a
matter
of
legally
enforceable
rights.
i'd
like
to
respond
in
terms
of
an
agency
case
i
learned
in
law
school.
i
think
it
involved
the
dwain
agency,
advertising
agency,
where
a
young
associate
went
off
and
left
with
a
major
client.
i
don't
--
damages
were
astronomical,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
the
client
could
leave
that
will.
he
haven't
taken
anything
except
goodwill,
except
the
favorable
relationship.
now,
these
miners
know
that
paragon
is
going
to
treat
them
well.
they
know
that
paragon
isn't
going
to
throw
them
off
for
no
good
reason
and
is
going
to
maintain
a
fairly
steady
price.
i
think
that's
what
they
paid
for.
at
this
point,
i
have
turned
the
facts
of
this
case
as
to
whether
there
is
terminability
at
the
will
of
paragon
and
as
to
whether
paragon
has
the
right
to
set
the
price
anywhere
they
want.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
either
one
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
either
one
proves
as
a
logical
matter
that
there's
no
legally
enforceable
right
to
share
in
the
value
of
the
deposit.
you
may
be
sharing
in
some
way
as
a
matter
of
a
gift
or
purchase
of
goodwill
by
paragon
but
no
legally
enforceable
right
to
share
it.
i'd
like
to
skip
over
terminability
saying
mainly
that
the
evidence
is
quite
lacking
on
this.
no
one
seems
to
have
discussed
very
much
or
there's
no
reliable
evidence
as
to
whether
paragon
could
terminate
at
will.
on
this
basis,
the
tax
court
held
that
they
would
not
find
terminability.
they
would
not
find
the
right
to
mind
exhaustion
when
no
one
had
said
anything
about
it,
especially
in
the
light
of
the
statute
of
frauds
which
seems
to
me
to
be
directly
and
intended
to
deal
with
oral
contract
such
as
this
i
would
have
thought
that
was
a
sound
result.
the
fourth
circuit
respondent
that
you
don't
allow
a
man
to
make
sizeable
investments
or
sizeable
at
least
in
his
terms
and
then
cut
him
off
at
will,
no
court
would
allow
that.i
think
there's
a
lot
of
sense
in
that.
however,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
if
a
man
makes
sizeable
investments
under
a
contract
with
no
specific
discussion
of
a
duration
of
the
contract,
you
pay
them
quantum
meruit.
you
pay
him
what
his
investment
was
worth.
you
don't
give
him
a
right
to
stay
on
indefinitely.
but
nobody
contemplates
giving
him
two
years
or
five
years
or
ten
years
because
the
only
term
of
court
can
infer
is
contract
at
will
or
indefinite.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
again
what
i'm
distinguishing
between
is
a
legally
enforceable
right
and
a
general
expectation
of
the
parties.
these
contracts
--
when
you
look
at
these
contracts
and
when
you
look
at
what
went
on
here,
you
can
start
right
off
by
saying
we
have
--
we're
dealing
between
people
with
unequal
economic
power.
these
are
contracts
entered
into
with
nothing
said
and
with
high
hopes
and
oftentimes
little
legal
support
for
their
high
hopes.
everybody
did
expect
to
stay
on,
they
didn't
expect
to
be
turned
off
and
paragon
expected
to
keep
them
on.
paragon
didn't
expect
to
steal
their
investment
down.
i'm
just
saying
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that
paragon
has
never
thrown
one
of
these
fellows
off,
though
some
have
quit.
but
let
me
get
the
price
which
is
the
heart
of
the
government's
case.
the
heart
of
the
government's
case
is
that
paragon
retain
the
legal
right
to
set
the
price
that
they
would
pay
for
mine
coal,
for
coal
mines
either
at
will
or
at
the
very
most
at
the
fair
market
value
of
the
service
of
the
miners.
now,
the
basic
facts
of
--
i
should
begin
by
saying
that
the
tax
court
--
i
should
refer
you
to
the
two
court
opinions
on
this
issue
which
we
regard
as
crucial.
in
the
record
at
page
22
--
oh
222,
is
the
tax
court
opinion
near
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
tax
court
says,
i
would
say
about
an
inch-and-a-half
up,
there's
no
evidence
that
the
amount
paid
by
paragon
was
directly
related
either
to
the
price
it
was
getting
for
the
coal
or
to
the
sales
price
of
a
particular
contractors
coal
and
the
amount
was
apparently
changeable
at
the
will
of
paragon
and
we
take
this
to
be
a
finding
that
paragon
could
post
what
prices
it
wished.
what
to
make
of
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
is
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
reading
the
record
you'll
find
over
and
over
again
miners
saying
that
they
didn't
know
what
paragon
was
being
paid.
now,
mr.
merrell
has
an
explanation
that
may
have
some
validity
to
it.
he
says
these
miners
knew
that
the
basic
field
price
of
bituminous
coal
that
they
didn't
really
know
what
paragon
is
being
paid.
i
was
going
to
get
to
reading
you
a
passage
on
91
if
you
would
like
to
skip
around
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
we
regard
the
transaction
to
be,
basically
a
transaction
between
economic
unequals,
people
with
unequal
economic
power.
this
is
a
miner
talking.
“did
the
price
that
you
receive
for
your
coal
vary
during
the
period?”
“yes
sir,
up
and
down.”
would
go
up
and
down
--
excuse
me
mr.
merrell
is
cross
examining
him.
“yes,
and
that
was
generally
in
accordance
with
changes
in
market
price
for
coal
was
it
not?”
“i
don't
know.
in
other
words,
i
guess
it
was.
they
would
come
and
tell
us
we
have
to
cut
you
or
they
would
raise
you
market
picked
up
i
imagine.”
“when
they
came
and
told
you
they
had
to
cut
you
didn't
you
ask
why?”
“i
don't
know
as
i
did.”
“being
in
the
coal
fields,
you
usually
know
when
it
was
up
and
down.
you
usually
knew.
weren't
you
concerned
that
the
fact
you
were
getting
cut?”
“was
i,
why
sure,
anybody
would
be
concerned
but
not
much
you
can
do
about
it,
i
don't
think.”
now
that's
our
picture
what
was
going
on
in
price
in
the
coal
fields.
by
the
way,
i
don't
want
to
dispute
in
any
way
that
paragon
apparently
when
it
arranged
the
price
terms
with
these
miners
said
to
them
right
up
to
that,
we're
going
to
pay
you
$4,
we
reserve
the
right
to
change
the
price
and
the
price
will
go
up
if
things
--
if
conditions
are
good
and
will
good
down
if
conditions
are
bad.
we
just
interpret
the
latter
--
the
very
last
statement
they'll
go
up
and
down
as
mainly
--
as
merely
reassurance
general
talk.
the
reservation
of
right
to
change
price
it
seems
to
us
to
be
legally
binding.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
court
of
appeals
statement
in
page
255,
basically,
it's
in
their
concluding
paragraph.
the
operators
had
a
continuing
right
to
produce
the
coal,
that's
their
finding
of
non-terminability
that
we
would
dispute
if
we
thought
it
was
necessary.
and
to
be
paid
therefore
at
a
price
which
was
closely
related
to
the
market
price.
now,
personally
i
read
that
as
saying
they
had
a
right
to
produce
the
coal
and
to
be
paid
at
a
price
which
was
in
fact
closely
related
to
the
market
price.
it
is
possible
to
read
it
as
saying
they
had
a
right
to
have
their
price
stay
in
touch
with
the
market
price.
we
think
that
when
a
mineral
lessee
retains
the
right
--
make
specific
his
right
to
change
the
price
and
no
standard
is
set
by
which
the
changes
will
be
measured,
you'd
have
to
find
that
he
has
the
right
to
change
the
price
as
he
wishes.
at
least
at
the
very
most
he's
obligated
to
pay
the
fair
market
value
of
services.
i
was
going
to
say
that
that
was
confirmed
by
three
facts.
one
that
the
miners
didn't
seem
to
generally
know
the
prices
paragon
was
paid.
i
wanted
to
quote
from
the
testimony
that
i
read
to
justice
goldberg.
and
the
three
of
the
jewel
brief,
there
is
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
by
jewel
ridge
coal
company
which
shows
a
very
good
job
of
tracing
its
reply
brief
in
particular.
it
does
a
very
good
job
of
tracing
what
happens
to
prices
of
coal
and
prices
paid
to
miners.
they
point
out
that
on
two
of
the
nine
occasions
with
no
drop
in
price
of
coal
that's
perceptible
at
all,
the
miners
take
a
25-cent
cut
in
price
paid
them
per
ton
of
coal
and
that's
very
sizeable
break.
they
just
don't
and
--
above
all,
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
indication
that
the
miners
ever
asserted
a
right
to
be
paid
a
certain
amount.
the
most
that
happens
when
there's
a
change
in
price
is
they
move
into
a
bargaining
posture
and
they
don't
even
do
that.
they
don't
have
the
power
to
do
that,
but
no
one
asserts
a
legal
right.
no
one
suggest
they
were
right
to
evade
anything
except
what
paragon
tells
them.
finally,
and
this
i
regard
as
nearly
conclusive,
if
you
were
going
to
find
a
right
in
this
case,
the
most
you
could
find,
we
believe,
would
be
an
obligation
to
pay
the
miners
the
fair
market
value
of
their
services
including
the
value
of
the
equipment
they
bring
into
the
job
and
the
value
of
the
capital
they
contribute.
you
couldn't
find
an
obligation
to
pay
them
anything
in
respect
to
the
coal
in
the
ground
which
paragon,
the
mineral
lessee
brought
to
the
job.
i
think
paragon
would
have
screamed
in
righteous
indignation
if
any
court
told
them
that
they
not
only
had
to
pay
for
the
services
and
the
equipment
but
also
for
the
coal
which
they
brought
to
the
job,
which
paragon
brought
to
the
job.
and
if
this
is
so,
then
the
miners
have
no
legally
enforceable
rights
to
share
in
the
value
of
a
coal
in
the
ground
and
therefore
they're
not
entitled
to
depletion
which
is
the
allowance
for
the
exhaustion
of
valuable
rights
to
share
in
the
coal
in
the
ground,
that's
the
heart
of
our
case.
now,
i'd
would
like
to
move
before
concluding
i'm
getting
near
the
end.
i
have
said
these
are
minimum
standards.
though
the
case
is
harder,
we
would
reach
the
same
result
even
if
the
contractors
in
this
case
keeping
all
the
other
facts
constant
were
paid
and
had
a
right
to
be
paid
a
fixed
amount
without
change
and
could
only
be
discharged
for
cause.
now
admittedly,
this
becomes
a
much
closer
case.
but
we
would
think
the
same
result
follows.
i
begin
by
looking
at
a
contractor
who's
paid
by
the
hour
or
in
a
cost
plus
percentage
of
the
cost
basis.
he
may
be
a
contractor
extracting
coal
from
the
ground.
he
may
be
a
contractor
grading
the
coal,
sizing
it,
dusting
it,
washing
it,
maybe
a
railroad
that
runs
a
little
spur
line
between
the
mine
and
the
processing
plant
that's
paid
on
a
weekly
basis
and
has
a
sizeable
capital
contribution.
indisputably,
each
of
these
people
has
a
sizeable
capital
contribution
and
the
capital
is
going
to
run
out
with
the
life
of
the
mine.
the
railroad
tracks
are
not
going
to
be
worth
anything
when
the
mine
is
not
worth
anything.
indisputably,
they're
in
a
--
as
a
matter
of
practical
reality,
they're
paid
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
coal,
even
though
they
have
an
independent
obligation.
equally
and
indisputably,
they're
not
entitled
to
depletion.
no
one
has
thought
they
were
entitled
to
depletion.
the
reason
is
depletion
is
recovery
for
the
value
of
the
coal
in
the
ground
not
for
the
cost
of
taking
it
out,
not
for
the
cost
of
moving
it
and
not
for
the
cost
of
grading
it
and
making
it
ready
for
sale.
the
only
difference
in
this
case
is
that
the
miners
are
paid
on
a
piece
work
basis
and
we
don't
think
that
can
be
controlling.
i'm
assuming
in
all
miner
cases
that
they
have
a
right
to
stay
on
as
long
as
they
produce
adequately.
we
don't
think
that
can
be
controlling.
as
i've
said
to
justice
goldberg,
it
is
possible
that
a
man
could
in
exchange
for
promise
to
render
services
or
in
exchange
for
services
obtain
a
depletable
interest.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
familiar
process
in
oil
fields
for
a
well
to
be
dug
--
drilled
in
exchange
for
an
oil
payment
and
we
allow
depletion
on
the
oil
payment
that
the
driller
receives
for
having
dug
the
well
but
what
the
miners
got
in
this
case,
even
if
you
assume
that
they
had
a
right
to
be
paid
a
fixed
amount
and
it
couldn't
be
terminated
for
something
very
different
from
a
royalty
interest,
from
any
interest
we
know
of
in
oil
or
coal
or
on
any
mineral.
they
weren't
to
be
paid
out
of
the
proceeds.
we
know
of
no
case
yet
where
people
have
a
right
to
be
paid
by
someone
else
not
out
of
proceeds
in
which
they
get
depletion.
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
be
paid
out
of
paragon's
pocket.
their
right
to
payment
was
only
when
they
did
the
work
and
as
they
did
the
work
on
particular
coal.
they
didn't
have
a
right
out
of
coal
that
they
didn't
work
on.
the
rights
were
apparently
non-assignable.
in
ordinary
royalty
interest
you
could
assign.
you
could
sell
to
someone
else.
in
this
case
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
alright
--
i
meant
to
put
a
shift
and
say
when
i
was
getting
to
four
parts
that
could
possibly
be
disputed.
in
both
assignments
in
this
case
justice
goldberg,
they
are
very
careful
to
clear
it
with
paragon
in
both
assignments
they're
very
careful
to
go
to
paragon
and
ask
paragon's
consent
and
the
transaction
was
conditioned
on
paragon's
consent.
there
was
no
right
to
demand
production.generally
a
man
who
has
an
interest
in
the
mineral
has
a
right
to
insist
that
the
mineral
come
out
of
the
ground
and
not
lay
there
forever.
we
think
merritt
had
no
right
to
demand
production.
finally,
and
this
too
is
disputed
the
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
merritt
had
to
stop.
merritt
had
to
stop
apparently,
justice
stewart
when
paragon
said
we
got
enough
coal
for
awhile.
if
paragon's
mill
--
not
paragon's
processing
mill
where
they
graded,
dusted
and
cleaned
coal
was
filled
up,
they
could
just
tell
paragon
stop.
in
one
occasion,
apparently
this
happened.
we
believe
from
the
record
paragon
could
say
the
market
is
bad.
the
market
is
no
good.
coals
flood
on
the
market
and
they
could
say
no
coal
for
a
while.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
last
thing
i
was
going
to
say.
i
wondering
whether
i
should
go
on
to
say
another
dispute
between
tax
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
is
whether
they
had
particular
boundaries
assigned
and
we
don't
believe
they
had
particular
boundaries
assigned
to
them.
tax
court
found
they
didn't,
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
they
did
but
of
all
these
we
would
rely
on
one
as
crucial.
and
that
is,
if
a
man
is
paid
only
for
the
mineral
he
processes
or
handles
or
works
on
and
only
when
as
he
works
on
it,
we
would
say
he's
being
paid
for
services
and
not
for
the
mineral.
not
being
paid
for
coal.
merritt
has
only
paid
--
excuse
me,
justice
white.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
government's
interest
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no,
i
would
--
the
government
has
three
interests.
we
do
want
to
see
the
right
person
get
the
deduction,
that's
not
an
interest
personal
to
government.
the
government
has
a
personal
interest
in
seeing
that
a
firm
and
workable
rules
develop.
in
this
case
we
had
to
deny
that
equation
to
two
taxpayers
make
two
of
them
go
through.
unfortunately,
the
actions
were
consolidated
but
we
don't
want
to
be
left
holding
the
bag.
we
like
to
see
a
firm
and
workable
role
develop.
one
or
the
other
taxpayer
will
get
the
deduction.
we'd
like
to
see
that
one
of
them
gets
it
and
the
two
of
them
don't.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
oh,
excuse
me?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
oh!
it
might.
if
i
--
i
couldn't
guess
which
way
the
government
would
get
more
money.
if
i
had
to
guess
and
i
would
have
made
no
effort
to
try,
i
would
think
that
we
would
get
more
money
by
arguing
the
other
way
from
that
which
i'm
arguing.
i
would
think
the
bigger
taxpayer
has
the
higher
net
income
and
can
use
the
deduction
more.
we're
arguing
against
our
immediate
financial
interest.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
third
reason
is
we
do
want
to
rule
that
isn't
tied
to
technicalities.
it's
tied
to
economic
realities.
whenever
rules
tied
to
technicalities
the
government
finds
that
the
taxpayer
with
a
high
bracket
has
much,
many
deductions
and
little
income
than
taxpayer
with
a
low
bracket
that
they
would
never
need
a
technical
rule.
taxpayers
can
manipulate
it
and
we
find
that
we
have
--
the
deduction
is
going
to
the
high
bracket
taxpayer
and
the
income
going
to
low
bracket
taxpayer.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
in
terms
of
what
lessee
has?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
justice
white,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
quite
understand.
in
econo
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
would
not
--
we
would
certainly
follow
the
economic
realities
and
not
the
word
‘lease'
your
honor.
we
don't
--
we
are
totally
indifferent
to
the
word
that's
written
at
the
top
of
the
document.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
do
lessees
share
in?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
certainly
they
do.
the
normal
range
for
this
that
the
lessee
pays
for
the
lessor
in
oil
of
1/8
royalty,
in
coal
in
this
case
30
cents
a
ton
and
retains
all
the
rest
for
himself.
what
he
does
in
the
case
of
oil
is
that
the
landowner
gets
depletion
on
the
1/8
or
on
the
30
cents,
well
in
coal
on
the
1/8
in
oil
--
on
oil
on
the
1/8
and
the
lessor
gets
all
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
would
want
to
know
what
reasonable
meant
and
then
i
would
be
able
to
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
the
word
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
in
terms
of
the
fair
market
value
of
the
services
rendered,
if
they
agree
to
sell
at
a
price
that
reflects
only
--
if
its
entitled
to
lease
and
the
lessee
agrees
to
sell
the
lessor
the
price
which
reflects
only
the
fair
market
value
of
the
services
rendered
by
the
lessee,
it's
this
case,
no
depletion
to
the
lessee.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
unrelated
to
the
value
of
the
coal.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
oh!
it
would
have
application
in
the
oil
business.
the
problem
doesn't
seem
to
arise
in
oil
because
the
major
expense
of
producing
oil
is
drilling.
the
drilling
is
completed
before
the
oil
payment
is
assigned.
at
that
point,
we
have
a
very
clear
example
of
completed
services
being
exchanged
for
what
is
a
traditional
royalty
interest.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
i
think
the
substance
would
be
very
different
if
you
cast
in
the
form
of
a
royalty.
you'd
have
to
give
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
but
the
substance
would
be
different
not
only
the
tax
results
but
the
substance.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
he
would
have
to
have
the
bargaining
power
to
demand
that
exclusive
right
to
a
particular
territory
to
demand
to
be
paid
a
sum
of
money
that
was
either
fixed
or
could
be
determined
by
judicial
standard,
out
of
all
coal
from
that
area
whether
he
withdrew
it
or
not.
he
would
have
to
have
a
right
to
assign
that
royalty
such
that
if
he
quit
his
services,
he
would
be
sued
for
damages
but
he
would
still
have
the
proceeds
of
his
royalty.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i'm
demonstrating
that
he
couldn't
demand
these
things
that
would
have
made
him
the
capitalist
that
depletion
is
given
to.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it
would
give
him
the
five
additional
rights
to
become
--
that
are
necessary
to
become
an
owner
of
mineral
on
the
ground.
he
doesn't
have
the
power
to
demand
those
and
he
didn't
get
them.
thank
you
your
honor.
