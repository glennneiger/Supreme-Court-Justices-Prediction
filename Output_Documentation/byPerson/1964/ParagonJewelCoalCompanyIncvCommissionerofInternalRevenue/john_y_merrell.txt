mr.
john
y.
merrell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
get
one
thing
straight
at
the
beginning.
this
court
has
very
wisely
held
that
ownership
of
the
mineral
in
the
ground
is
not
essential
to
the
depletion
allowance.
it
has
been
written
into
the
government
regulations.
what
the
government
regulations
say
is
that
the
ownership
of
an
economic
interest
when
this
controversy
started
that
government
was
neutral.
somewhere
along
the
line
they
were
persuaded
to
abandon
their
neutrality
and
i'm
distressed
to
learn
that
the
best
reason
that
the
commissioner
can
give
is
that
it
was
a
bargain
between
unequals
and
they
chose
to
take
the
big
man.
i'll
dare
say
that
when
the
law
of
this
case
is
analyzed,
you'll
find
that
the
position
of
the
coal
mine
operators
who
were
the
respondents
in
number
237
is
more
closely
and
more
consistent
with
published
rulings
and
regulations
of
the
commissioner
and
with
opinions
of
this
court.
the
government
went
through
its
argument
here
without
once
discussing
the
most
recent
case
of
this
court
which
was
parsons
versus
smith
and
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
depletion
allowance
of
a
coalminer.
i
want
to
say
this
on
the
law.
i
feel
that
if
i
can
adequately
inform
this
court
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case
that
i
need
not
concern
myself
the
law.
it
says
that
these
general
principles
of
law
are
to
be
applied
according
to
the
peculiar
circumstances
in
the
case.
this
court
has
never
gone
into
the
question
of
drift
binding
from
a
taxation
standpoint.
it's
a
practice
that
developed
some
20
years
ago
in
the
areas
of
virginia,
west
virginia
and
kentucky
when
they
learned
that
there
were
low
thin
seams
of
coal
that
the
big
mine
operations
have
not
been
able
to
mine
out
and
could
not
be
mined
with
expensive
equipment
but
they
left
themselves
to
mining
by
hand
loading
and
that
a
small
operator
if
he
had
enough
courage
and
a
little
bit
of
resources
that
he
could
go
in
there
and
make
a
living
at
it.
it
was
high
quality
coal
but
it
lent
itself
to
handle
loading
rather
than
to
machine
loading.
now,
this
case
is
typical.
one
individual
acquired
a
certain
acreage
of
coal
leases.
he
then
forms
a
corporation
to
which
he
transfers
his
leases.
then
the
corporation
develops
what
we
call
a
processing
plant
to
receive
the
coal,
process
it,
load
it,
size
it,
enters
into
an
agreement
with
a
sales
agent
and
a
sales
agent
agrees
to
sell
it.
now,
that's
what
paragon
did
in
this
case
they
were
all
ready
to
go
in
1952
but
lacked
one
thing
that
was
production
of
coal.
none
of
this
was
a
value
to
anybody
unless
somebody
was
willing
to
mine
the
coal.
now,
paragon
was
obligated
under
its
leases
to
mine
this
coal.
it
also
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
practical
economics
had
to
mine
the
coal
in
order
to
survive
but
the
difficulty
was
and
this
is
in
the
record.
paragon
did
not
have
the
funds
to
invest
in
the
production
and
mining
the
coal
and
its
priced
and
dominant
stockholder
mr.
claiborne
said
he
would
not
expose
his
personal
funds
to
the
hazards
of
the
coal
mining
business.
now
why
it's
hazardous
because
as
i
have
said
this
is
a
thin
seam.
the
big
coal
operators
don't
bother
them
with
it.
it
never
gets
more
than
30
inches
high.
that
means
that
all
work
has
to
be
done
in
an
area
that's
never
more
than
30
inches
high.
you
can't
use
this
big
expensive
equipment.
it's
an
irregular
seam
which
means
that
it
will
be
going
on
30
inches
high
and
the
first
thing
you
know
it's
pitched
down
until
it's
two
inches
high
or
pinches
out
completely.
then
you've
got
no
coal
to
mine
but
if
you're
going
to
mine
the
coal
beyond
where
you
mine,
you
got
to
drive
through
the
sandstone
and
the
limestone
which
is
a
more
onerous
burden
than
extracting
the
coal
itself.
it's
necessary
to
develop
these
areas
by
hand
loading.
the
men
go
in
there
and
work
on
their
knees
and
as
i
said,
it's
means
by
which
a
man
of
modern
means
in
that
area
and
assemble
a
workforce
maybe
of
20
to
40
individuals
and
make
a
fairly
good
living
at
it
if
he's
got
enough
courage
and
if
he's
got
a
little
bit
of
luck.
now,
drift
mining
is
as
different
from
strip
mining
as
night
is
from
day.
now,
that's
a
pretty
good
way
to
put
it
because
when
you
strip
mine
you
have
all
the
freedom
of
good
surface
you
don't
have
it
when
you
drift
mine.
we
don't
disturb
the
surface,
we're
not
the
people
who
make
all
this
restoration
of
surface
mining
necessary
and
if
all
the
coal,
new
mine
comes
out
of
one
ton,
one
entry.
it's
all
done
underground.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
says
--
the
court
below
says,
our
decision
--
their
decision's
within
the
rationale
of
parsons
versus
smith.
paragon
says
it's
not,
the
tax
court
says
it's
not,
the
commissioners
says
it's
not.
well
let's
discuss
what
this
court
did
in
parsons
versus
smith
and
see
how
it
compares
with
the
facts
in
his
case.
this
court
reviewed
the
law,
cited
the
regulations
then
came
to
the
facts
and
it
said
first
that
in
parsons
versus
smith,
the
investment
was
an
equipment
all
of
which
was
movable
not
in
the
coal
in
place.
the
--
that
was
true.
the
strip
mining
is
no
different
than
any
large
excavation
job
such
as
road
building,
bridge
building
or
airport
building
and
you
have
a
certain
problem
moving
your
equipment
on
to
the
site,
once
you
get
it
there
and
made
a
few
minor
preparations
you're
ready
to
go
and
you
can
be
in
production
immediately,
you
just
move
the
earth
and
scoop
up
the
coal.
now,
in
both
of
those
cases,
in
the
parson's
case
if
the
agreement
was
terminated
by
the
coal
owner,
the
coal
--
the
landowner,
the
strip
miner
had
the
right
to
mine
and
be
paid
for
all
uncovered
coal
in
the
huss
case
the
agreement
was
that
the
strip
miner
was
obliged
only
to
remove
coal
which
lied
a
prescribed
distance,
more
than
a
prescribed
distance
from
the
surface.
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
that
their
operation
was
predictable,
it
was
premised
on
expensive
equipment
and
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
this
court
to
say
that
their
investment
was
in
their
equipment
rather
than
in
the
coal
in
place.
let's
contrast
it
with
the
facts
in
this
case
and
i
don't
believe
these
facts
are
subject
to
dispute.
paragon
was
obligated
to
open,
develop,
preserve
and
produce
the
coal
under
its
leases
if
more
than
anybody
else
knew
the
obligation
it
was
placing
on
the
mine
operators.
it
says,
“we'll
place
this
all
on
you
and
we'll
encourage
you
to
do
it.”
now
i've
outlined
in
my
brief
pages
5
and
6
and
11
to
7
deem
what
these
investments
were.
i'll
just
outline
them
briefly
here.
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
preparatory
work
but
had
to
be
done
at
the
mine
entry,
what
we
call
the
mouth
of
the
mine.
this
would
take
maybe
from
a
month
to
six
weeks.
after
that
was
completed
they
start
driving
them
to
mountain
and
remove
coal.
the
only
problem
they
got
is
that
the
coal
lying
near
the
outside
is
what
they
call
outcrop
coal.
it's
not
marketable
nobody
wants
it
so
it
may
go
for
20
feet,
it
may
go
for
200
feet.
they
never
know
so
they
have
to
drive
in
till
they
get
to
quality
coal
that
can
be
sold.
the
second
problem
is,
it's
low
coal
and
no
more
than
two
or
three
people
can
work
in
an
area
and
you
can't
have
a
productive
drift
mine
with
only
two
or
three
employees
so
you've
got
to
expose
enough
working
areas,
working
faces
as
they
call
it
so
you
can
engage
an
adequate
compliment
and
make
your
mine
profitable
that
you
need
to
expose
these.
sometimes
this
takes
six
months,
eight
months.
i'll
show
in
a
minute
that
in
two
of
the
mines
here
it
took
eight
months
before
they
got
into
what
we
call
a
production
end
of
the
business
rather
the
than
the
developed
end
of
it.
while
they're
doing
this,
they
have
to
comply
with
all
state
and
federal
regulations
and
these
are
very
onerous,
they
are
known
to
paragon,
they
are
known
to
the
drift
mine
operators.
they
require
safety
measures.
you're
going
to
have
to
drive
an
air
course
that
will
go
from
a
separate
entry
so
that
air
can
be
pumped
through
all
of
your
working
places.
you
set
a
large
fan
at
the
mouth
of
your
air
course.
it
pulls
the
air
through.
that
has
to
be
in
your
mind
constantly
and
if
--
before
you
can
send
and
compliment
them
in
there,
you'll
have
to
conduct
what
they
call
a
fire
bust,
running
a
gaseous
mine,
that
is
send
a
man
through
with
an
instrument
to
measure
the
methane
content
of
the
mine
and
then
if
it's
inspectors
says,
it's
alright
you
can
send
your
workers
in
there.
secondly,
you
got
to
provide
for
the
roof
of
your
mine
and
this
is
a
real
burden.
you
got
to
support
the
mine
because,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
once
that
mountain
falls
after
you've
mined
an
area
of
coal,
if
it
falls
in
the
coal
beyond
there
is,
if
not
lost,
extremely
difficult
to
obtain.
you
would
have
to
go
around
by
some
circuitous
course
and
obtain
it.
well,
you
support
the
roof
by
setting
timbers
on
what
they
call
18-inch
centers.
a
timber
is
nothing
more
than
a
piece
of
lumber
or
a
timber
that
four
to
six
inches
wide
and
as
you
mine
you
prop
it
up
to
hold
the
roof
up.
in
addition,
you
leave
what
they
call
pillars.
these
are
large
bodies
of
coal.
they
would,
sometimes
as
large
as
60
foot
square.
you
have
to
leave
them
to
support
the
mouth
as
you're
driving
back.
in
addition
you
run
into
certain
adverse
mining
conditions.
you'll
go
into
your
mind
some
morning
and
find
it's
full
of
water
and
no
choice
but
to
set
pumps
and
draw
it
to
the
outside.
this
may
take
a
day;
it
may
take
two
or
three
days.
the
worse
problem
one
that
always
brings
the
miners
down
is
what
they
call
rolls
and
that's
this
situation
where
the
coal
squeezes
out.
they
get
in
these
rolls
the
record
shows
that
one
of
these
miners
were
in
the
roll
for
87
days.
now
while
he
was
in
that
roll
he
was
not
mining
coal,
he
was
mining
rock
and
it
has
to
be
mined
and
moved
to
the
outside
of
the
mine
and
he
gets
paid
absolutely
nothing
for
it.
in
addition,
you
have
such
things
as
bad
top
and
other
problems.
now,
these
things
i've
mentioned
are
capital
investments
to
my
mind
for
this
reason.
they
serve
the
--
to
enhance
the
value
of
coal
in
place.
depletion
is
of
value
to
no
one
unless
somebody
willing
to
enter
into
the
production
end
of
it
and
the
development
of
the
mine.
it
needs
no
belaboring
that
point
that
a
developed
mine
is
worth
more
than
a
mine
at
the
time
you're
initiating
it.
these
such
costs
all
of
which
have
been
regarded
not
only
by
miners
but
by
the
internal
revenue
service
as
development
costs
until
a
mine
gets
into
what
we
call
a
production
stage.
i
asked
the
clerk
to
pass
to
you,
to
pass
a
little
schedule.
now,
this
will
give
you
an
idea
better
than
any
words
i
could
employ
this
is
the
caiva
mine.
it
started
in
august
1954.
it
shows
the
tons
mine.
they
didn't
do
any
good
in
august
and
september.
they
were
getting
ready
to
mine.
then
it
shows
their
gross
from
paragon,
their
deduction,
their
net
income.
nine
months
later
at
april
1955,
they
were
$5400
behind.
now,
this
isn't
their
total
investment.
this
is
the
amount
they
put
into
the
mine
less
what
they
received
and
i
might
say
that
this
isn't
my
answer
though.
this
is
an
exhibit
that
paragon
put
into
the
record.
they
asked
permission
the
conclusion
of
the
tax
court
hearing
to
go
down
and
check
our
records
and
make
this
exhibit.
the
exhibit
i
put
in
which
showed
a
much
more
unfortunate
picture
but
i'll
rely
on
theirs.
it
shows
that
after
nine
months
of
hard
work,
they're
$5400
behind
and
there's
another
investment
on
top
of
this
and
i
think
were
too
inclined
to
talk
about
investment
in
terms
of
money.
it's
easy
to
say
we
spent
$200,000
for
a
processing
plant
or
for
a
drag
line
but
in
addition
to
any
monetary
investment
these
men
are
full
time
miners.
they're
not
gentlemen
miners.
they
don't
do
their
mining
at
the
barbershop
or
other
local
gathering
places,
they're
everyday.
so
in
addition
to
what
i
have
indicated
there
you
have
the
services
of
three
full
time
grown
adult
miners
for
10
months.
if
you'll
check
exhibit
102,
i
believe
it
is,
that
shows
the
same
history
102
is
an
exhibit
which
paragon
put
in
with
reference
to
the
steel
well
mine.
it
shows
the
same
type
of
history.
you
work
there
for
eight
or
nine
months
before
you're
doing
any
good
at
all
and
at
that
time
your
probably
anywhere
from
$2000
to
$10,000
behind,
plus
the
time
you're
out,
plus
the
investment
that
you
put
no
the
property.
now,
make
the
statement
that
we'd
explained
any
capital
investment
in
the
coal,
that's
not
accurate.
what
they
ask
in
the
court
several
times
was
did
you
own
the
coal.
you
don't
contend
that
you
own
the
coal.
we've
never
contended
that
we
own
the
coal.
i
frankly,
don't
know
who
owns
the
coal
while
it's
there
in
the
mine
but
we
didn't
disclaim
the
fact
that
we
had
certain
rights
in
the
coal
in
place.
now,
let's
go
to
parsons
versus
smith
again.
they
said
there's
and
tying
in
with
this
question
i
just
made,
this
point
i
just
made
they
said
the
strip
miners'
investment
was
in
their
equipment
all
of
which
was
recoverable
through
depletion
and
depreciation
not
depletion
and
paragon
picks
that
up
and
it
makes
this
statement
in
its
brief
two
or
three
times.
to
allow
the
drift
miners'
depletion
what
enabled
them
to
recover
for
the
exhaustion
of
a
capital
investment
which
they
never
made.
well,
i'll
turn
it
around
on
them
to
allow
paragon
the
full
depletion
allows
would
enable
it
to
recover
for
a
capital
investment
which
it
never
made
because
it
specifically
refused
to
make
the
capital
investment
essential
to
production
of
coal.
now,
i
--
we're
not
here
saying
paragon
does
not
have
an
economic
interest.
they
do
have
they
made
certain
investments,
they
paid
the
minimum
loyalties
which
were
minor,
they
paid
the
real
estate
taxes,
they
established
the
processing
plant
and
they
had
the
right
to
receive
the
mineral
but
they
did
not
make
and
they
cannot
find
--
you
cannot
find
in
the
record
any
place
where
they
made
an
investment
for
the
production
of
coal.
they
put
that
obligation
on
the
contract
miners
and
i
don't
like
this
double
standard
they
talk
about.
everything
that
paragon
has
put
into
this
operation
they
deducted
for
tax
purposes.
you'll
find
that
on
record
84.
we
ask
their
accountant,
“is
there
anything
you
put
into
this
operation
that
you
haven't
heretofore
deducted
in
some
means
other
than
depletion?”
he
said,
“nothing.”
i
think
there
was
some
life
insurance
payments
on
their
president's
life
or
something
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
for
them
to
say
you've
deducted
these
things
so
therefore
you
shouldn't
get
depletion.
the
fact
is
they've
deducted
every
penny
they
put
into
this
operation.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
its
obligation
under
all
its
leases
was
to
pay
a
minimum
royalty
$1000
on
one
piece
of
land,
$4000
on
the
other.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
right.
on
minimum
royalty
if
you
excuse
me,
justice
white,
i
might
say
that
they
did
advance
a
little
minimum
royalty
but
it's
all
recouped
after
--
out
of
production.
they
could
recoup
it
in
later
years
out
of
production
in
any
payment
rather.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
the
term
of
their
lease,
it
varied
in
most
cases.
i
think
one
lease
was
a
five-year
with
a
right
to
renew
for
additional
period.
some
of
their
leases,
there
is
one
lease
here
where
they
have
the
right
to
terminate
themselves.
it
was
terminable
and
at
their
will,
not
any
of
these
contractors
remained
under.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
i
said
--
what
i
said
and
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
paragon
did
not
invest
in
the
development
and
production
of
the
coal.
now,
under
statute,
coal
mining
is
defined
as
including
the
production
of
coal
plus
certain
processing
factors
that
take
place.
now,
paragon
did
invest
for
the
processing
of
coal
and
they
had
the
right
to
receive
and
sell
it
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
they
invested
nothing
for
the
production
of
coal
aside
from
the
minimum
royalty
and
the
real
estate.
the
third
thing
that
this
court
mentioned
in
parsons
versus
smith
was
that
the
rights
there
were
completely
terminable
at
will
on
short
notice.
in
the
parsons
case,
the
parsons
was
a
road
builder.
he
went
there
and
they
offered
him
a
long
term
contract.
he
said
i
don't
want
it,
i'm
a
road
builder.
i
insist
on
a
10-day,
right
of
termination
in
10
days
because
if
i
get
a
good
opportunity
to
go
back
to
road
building,
i
want
to
do
it
and
they
entered
into
an
oil
contract
10-day
terminable
on
either
side.
in
the
huss
--
and
as
i
mentioned,
if
it
was
terminated
by
the
landowner,
he
could
extract
all
uncovered
coal.
in
huss,
the
agreement
terminable
without
cost
and
without
liability
on
30
days
notice.
now,
let's
go
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
nothing
was
said
at
the
time
these
agreements
were
made
about
termination.
witnesses
for
both
sides
so
testified
and
the
tax
court
so
found.
the
miners
were
going
there
with
the
idea
in
mind
of
developing
the
property.
they
knew
and
paragon
knew
that
they
could
not
make
any
income
out
of
this
operation
until
they've
been
on
the
premises
for
at
least
four
weeks
and
that
would
be
in
the
event
of
the
lucky
situation
and
probably
more
likely
than
not
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
eight
months
or
two
years
so
they
both
bargained
with
idea
in
mind
that
they
would
stay
on
the
property,
that
was
certainly
the
intent
of
the
contractors.
now,
they
refer
to
this
exhibit
86
and
87
where
it
has
a
statement
in
there
that
well
it
says,
“in
two
places
that
the
question
of
termination
never
arose
and
then
in
the
argument
part
of
the
protest
there
is
some
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
agreement
specified
the
right
of
termination
by
either
party
but
the
question
never
arouse
between
the
party
for
the
agreement.
the
tax
court
put
no
weight
on
it.
the
court
below
put
no
weight
on
it.
it's
an
inconsistent
document.
the
record
explains
clearly
how
it
was
developed,
how
it
was
created
and
the
reasons
behind
it.
mr.
merritt
testified
with
respect
thereto
and
i
won't
burden
the
court
further
with
that
at
this
time
but
i
want
to
deal
with
this
a
minute.
they
say
that
some
of
the
miners
quit.
that's
--
we
admit
that
a
number
of
them
quit.
you
have
them
quitting
all
the
time.
it's
not
an
easy
occupation.
it's
not
for
the
fainthearted
and
it's
not
for
those
who
do
not
have
sufficient
resources
to
see
it
through
and
if
a
man
goes
in
and
takes
one
of
these
operations
and
goes
broke,
he's
got
no
choice
but
to
quit
but
the
point
is
when
he
quits,
everything
that
he's
putting
to
that
operation
accrues
to
the
benefit
of
paragon
because
when
he
went
there,
they
had
nothing.
when
he
left
there
was
the
benefit
of
whatever
work
he
had
done
and
if
he
brought
it
up
to
a
point
where
it
was
a
developed
and
productive
mine,
then
paragon
had
a
developed
and
productive
mine.
and
i
want
to
put
this
point
out,
none
of
these
people
before
this
court
went.
these
people
were
going
in
there
with
the
idea
of
putting
their
own
money
and
their
own
efforts
into
it
and
they
didn't
quit
and
the
record's
also
clear
that
paragon
never
terminated
anybody.
so
i
don't
i
think
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
they
not
only
wouldn't
be
likely
to
quit
but
he
wouldn't
let
him
throw
him
off
either.
this
is
when
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
oh!
i
see
your
point.
well,
they
wouldn't
quit
if
they
got
into
a
probable
standpoint
but
say
they
got
it
50%
of
the
way.
then
if
they
weren't
able
to
make
it,
the
next
person
taking
over
would
at
least
50%
of
this
development
worked
out.
no,
it's
not
likely
that
they
would
quit
as
long
as
the
--
if
they
had
it
operating
productive
mine.
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
parsons
v.
smith
there's
some
language
in
there
to
the
effect
that
the
landowners
did
not
agree
to
surrender
and
did
not
surrender
any
interest
in
the
coal
in
place.
i'll
agree
with
that.
they
agreed
to
--
they
gave
a
right
to
mine
for
10
days
to
one,
the
right
to
mine
for
30
days
to
another.
here
paragon
surrendered.
it
didn't
own
the
coal
to
start
with.
that
did
belong
to
landowner.
it
was
lessee.
it
didn't
own
the
coal
in
the
ground
but
it
did
have
the
right
to
remove
it,
reduce
it
to
possession
and
to
sell
it.
it
surrendered
that
right
to
the
coal
mine
operator.
thereafter,
they
have
the
right
to
reduce,
extract
the
coal,
reduce
it
to
possession
and
to
be
paid
by
paragon
for
the
coal
and
i
submit
to
you
that
paragon
by
entering
into
that
agreement
and
putting
the
obligations
on
the
contractor
also
surrendered
a
real
substantive
right
in
the
coal
in
place.
the
right
to
mine
coal
is
a
very
definite
interest
in
coal
because
unless
somebody
has
the
right
to
extract
in
these
depletion
cases,
nobody
is
going
to
get
the
depletion.
the
argument
has
generally
not
been
with
the
producer.
the
man
who
is
actually
producing
the
coal
is
generally
with
some
taxpayer
who
acquires
a
lease
and
then
assigns
the
operating
interest
to
another
party
for
an
additional
interest
of
some
kind.
it's
generally
a
middle
man
that
was
the
case
in
palmer
versus
bender
and
these
other
cases.
there
hasn't
been
any
real
question
whether
a
producer
have
the
right
as
long
as
his
rights
were
absolute,
as
long
as
they
could
not
terminated.
i
have
already
touched
briefly
on
the
point
of
ownership.
they
talk
so
much
about
ownership.
i'm
not
sure
as
just
what
they
mean.
i
regard
ownership
as
a
bundle
of
rice
in
an
asset
and
certainly
among
the
bundle
of
rights
here,
the
coal
mine
operator
certainly
had
the
rights
of
real
substance.
let's
get
to
the
question
of
price
and
i'm
sticking
with
parsons
versus
smith
and
that's
the
case
the
court
below
relied
on,
that's
the
one
the
government
says
doesn't
control
here.
there
on
the
question
of
compensation,
the
parsons
was
to
receive
a
fixed
price
per
ton,
huss
was
to
receive
a
fixed
price
per
ton.
in
the
huss
case,
it
was
specifically
understood
between
the
parties
that
this
would
be
as
compensation
for
work
performed.
the
market
or
the
sale
of
the
coal
by
the
landowners
in
that
case
didn't
enter
into
the
agreement
between
parsons
and
the
landowner
in
any
way
you
can
search
the
case
from
the
district
court
up
and
you
cannot
find
where
the
market
played
any
part
with
respect
thereto.
now,
this
--
commissioner's
counsel
conceded
that
at
the
beginning
of
these
negotiations
the
operators
were
told
that
they
would
be
paid
a
certain
price
per
ton,
$4
per
ton
but
a
price
will
be
governed
to
some
extent
by
the
market.
if
the
market
drops
we
reserve
the
right
to
decrease
the
price,
if
the
market
goes
up
we
will
give
you
an
interest.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
or
has
taken
an
equitable
apportionment.
that's
what
we're
seeking
here
and
on
this
particular
point
by
making
that
provision
part
of
the
agreement,
paragon
refused
to
give
its
personal
covenant.
it
said
you've
got
to
look
behind
us
to
the
market
to
see
what
you
from
whence
you
recovery
your
investment
and
the
record
is
clear
that
the
price
did
fluctuate
in
accordance
with
the
market.
in
fact,
the
present
where
paragon
said
that
it
did
vary
indirectly
with
the
market
price
for
coal.
when
they
said,
what
do
you
mean
indirectly?
what
other
factors?
he
couldn't
mention
any
other
factors
which
entered
into
the
price
arrangement.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
the
government
has
made
a
division
in
accordance
with
its
regulations.
now,
it
works
this
way.
paragon
is
obliged
to
pay
a
royalty
which
it
pays
to
the
assignor,
mr.
claiborne
and
he
takes
that
royalty
in
and
reports
it
as
capital
gain
and
to
pay
in
any
sub-royalties,
offset
in
royalties
that
he
has
to
pay.
the
division
and
the
regulation
is
that
if
paragon
sells
it
for
6
1/2
a
ton
and
the
royalty
comes
out,
that's
its
rule
625
and
it
pays
us
$4
a
ton,
then
the
parties
themselves
have
made
the
apportionment.
we
get
it
on
$4
a
ton
and
they
get
it
on
$2.25
cents
a
ton,
that's
the
way
these
statute
works.
if
you
once
grant
the
proposition
that
the
mine
operators
are
entitled
to
it.
i
think
i
had
some
other
points
here
but
mr.
heymann
has
conceded
that
the
operators
were
interested
in
what
paragon
was
realizing
for
their
coal,
rightfully
so
because
if
paragon
did
well
then
under
their
agreement,
if
their
market
price
went
up
they
could
get
it
in.
he
quoted
certain
testimony
from
one
of
the
witnesses
which
would
happen
to
be
witness
of
paragon
who
had
some
obligation
to
paragon
where
he
said
that
he
didn't
care
about
the
price
or
the
price
didn't
mean
anything
to
him
but
i
think
the
record
is
clear
upon
analysis
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
they
were
definitely
interested
in
the
market
price.
well,
that's
the
only
industry
in
the
buchanan
county
of
any
cost
or
these
if
a
dock
changes
its
price
at
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
everybody
up
the
lunch
stop
knows
about
it
by
12.
now
the
tax
court
didn't
make
a
finding
that
the
price
was
apparently
changeable
at
the
will
of
paragon.
it
said
that
the
price
did
fluctuate
based
on
overextended
periods
based
on
market
conditions
and
then
at
the
conclusion
and
to
some
extent
on
labor
cost
then
in
its
opinion
towards
the
conclusion
it
says
that
this
amount
that
paragon
paid
was
apparently
changeable
at
the
will
of
the
paragon
suggesting
that
the
tax
court
itself
was
very
certain
about
it
but
i
think
what
it
refers
to
is
this
that
paragon
being
the
party
that
receive
the
coal
and
marketed,
it
always
initiated
the
price
changes
and
since
all
of
the
price
changes
which
it
initiated
were
in
accordance
with
the
market,
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
operators
to
object.
i
just
want
to
move
on
to
one
other
point
and
then
i
think
i'm
nearing
the
conclusion
here.
there's
been
some
testimony
here
that
the
fact
that
these
individuals
were
not
given
a
specific
area
to
mine.
the
tax
court
was
a
little
wishy
washy
on
it.
it
didn't
bother
the
court
below
any
but
upon
the
record,
you
can
examine
the
testimony
of
the
operators
and
you'll
find
that
they
testified
that
they
were
assigned
a
specific
area.
now,
the
testimony
of
the
--
i
mean
the
only
testimony
on
the
contrary
is
the
engineer
who
was
in
charge
of
the
operation
and
who
the
operators
have
to
pay
for
all
inside
engineering
work.
now,
he
at
the
beginning
of
his
testimony
jumped
all
over
the
place
as
to
whether
there
was
or
wasn't
an
error,
but
on
three
occasions
towards
the
end
of
his
testimony,
he
was
pinned
down
on
his
question.
once
by
counsel
for
the
mine
operators,
twice
by
the
tax
court
and
these
appear
at
records
78
through
83
and
he
conceded
that
no
change
that
he
had
ever
made
caused
any
operator
to
lose
coal
that
was
always
a
question
of
adding
coal,
that
all
of
it
--
that
at
no
time
did
he
make
a
change
on
the
operator's
projections
of
maps
which
cost
any
operator
operating
at
that
time
to
lose
any
coal.
it
was
always
to
add
coal.
what
would
happen
is
this.
they
drive
in
the
mine
and
operator
a
let's
take
the
merritt's,
they
would
operating.
operator
b
would
go
broke
or
quit
or
something.
after
he
had
stopped
operating
then
merritt's
would
make
a
deal
to
mind
some
coal
otherwise
it
would
have
been
mined
by
operator
b
and
a
new
allocation
would
be
made
or
paragon
would
acquire
additional
leases
then
they
would
come
to
the
operator
and
ascertain
whether
he
wanted
to
take
on
the
burden
of
mining
an
additional
amount
of
coal.
so
there
is
no
case
when
any
coal
was
ever
taken
away
from
an
operator
who
was
operating
at
that
time.
if
the
commissioner
desires
a
workable
rule
in
this
case
in
this
whole
situation,
i
submit
he's
got
one.
he
submit
--
he
issued
a
gcm
in
1950.2629
is
the
number
of
it,
which
spells
out
the
rules
with
reference
of
the
strip
mine
and
i
submit
our
case
comes
within.
i
won't
go
into
it
now.
i
submit
that
he
would
--
if
he
would
update
that
a
little,
he
hasn't
revoked
it
since
parsons
v.smith
bring
in
the
principles
of
parsons
v.
smith
either
have
not
only
a
workable
rule
but
an
equitable
rule
and
if
it's
going
to
be
workable,
it
has
got
to
be
placed
on
the
economic
realities
of
the
situation
rather
than
some
fine
legal
distinction
as
to
whether
they
own
the
coal,
whether
they
have
legal
title
to
it
because
taxation
is
a
practical
matter
and
it
is
the
burdens
that
you
place
on
people
that
should
give
rise
to
the
deductions
in
the
benefits.
we
go
in
here
our
people.
we
make
this
investment
and
when
we
don't
make
it
--
when
we
don't
make
it,
then
there's
no
income
to
pay
but
when
we
do
make
it
we
think
we're
entitled
to,
we're
obligated
to
pay
our
tax
and
also
entitled
to
any
benefits
that
true
to
us.
i
particularly
dislike
the
commissioner's
argument
in
this
case
because
it's
based
primarily
on
speculation
as
to
what
might
have
happened
or
what
could
have
happened.
he
says
that
they
have
no
rights,
that
paragon
could
just
pay
them
for
services
and
if
they
came
down
to
a
question
of
bargaining
power
--
this
is
the
little
man
and
this
is
the
big
man.
well,
i'll
close
by
saying
this
that
our
position
of
this
argument
has
been
known
to
paragon
since
1956.
at
that
time
the
stillwell
case
was
being
litigated
and
it
was
decided
favorably
to
the
coal
mine
operators
by
the
court
below.
he
has
known
since
then
our
position
with
respect
to
this.
he
has
never
attempted
to
clarify
our
contract,
never
attempted
to
renegotiate
it
and
never
even
threatened
the
prices
out
of
our
contract
by
reducing
the
level
to
a
price
at
which
we
couldn't
operate
or
any
of
these
things.
on
the
contrary,
he
has
taken
the
benefits
of
the
agreement
and
knowing
that
we
had
a
certain
understanding
with
respect
thereto.
this
has
been
onerous
litigation
for
my
people.
they're
not
wealthy
people
and
the
amounts
aren't
big
and
if
this
whole
question
if
they
have
the
right
determination
they
could
have
been
decided
for
a
fraction
of
the
expanse
that
has
been
spent
in
this
tax
litigation.
all
paragon
has
to
do
is
bring
action
of
ejectment
in
buchanan
county,
virginia
then
we
would
find
out
directly
and
quickly
whether
they
could
terminate
or
not.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
i
think
it
would
be
--
i
think
it
would
be
weaker.
i
really
don't
think
it
makes
as
much
a
difference
as
we
say
for
this
reason.
the
regulations
doesn't
say,
the
regulation
says
this.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
no,
i
think
if
the
price
depends
upon
the
market
price
of
coal
i
think
it
presents
stronger
situation,
yes.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
i
think
it
does.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
it
depends
on
market.
i
think
it
definitely
depends
on
the
market
price
of
coal.
every
change
that
was
made
during
the
term
of
this
agreement
was
made
in
accordance
with
a
significant
shift
in
the
market
price
of
coal.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
why
it
doesn't?
mr.
john
y.
merrell
no,
because
the
mine
operators
here
made
a
capital
investment
which
enhanced
the
value
of
the
unmined
coal.
their
rights
would
not
be
terminated.
they
were
given
the
right
to
mine
not
just
for
10
days
but
for
30
days
and
they
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
sure
it
was
the
work.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
the
labor,
their
labor.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
there
was
more
on
that.
it
was
the
labor.
it
was
the
timbers
that
they
put
up.
it
was
the
coal
the
facing
of
the
pillars
that
they
have
to
leave.
all
that
is
a
capital
investment
because
it
produces
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
the
--
over
by
burden
and
the
strip
mining
operation
is
generally
measurable.
in
most
strip
mining
contracts
you
don't
have
to
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
you
can
get
in
the
full
scale
production
almost
immediately
in
a
strip
mining
operation.
the
investment
is
in
equipment.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
right,
i
agree.
yes
strip
mining
can
be
a
burdensome
thing
so
there
can
be
a
large
amount
of
overburden
mr.
john
y.
merrell
no,
i
submit
because
in
strip
mining
you
can
move
from
site
to
site
or
from
location
on
a
particular
site
without
any
problem
at
all.
in
drift
mining,
it's
all
must
come
out
at
one
entry
and
one
tunnel
and
that
makes
a
real
difference
because
these
mines
i
might
say
they're
a
mile-and-a-half
deep,
they
were
at
the
time
of
trial.
what
you
did
up
here
at
the
mouth
of
the
mine
is
valuable
now
for
extracting
coal
that
lies
a
mile-and-a-half
deep.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
their
level
are
at
some
variation.
they
don't
go
straight.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
this
isn't
shaft
mining,
no.
it's
not
shaft.
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
between
this
operation
and
drift
mining.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
the
labor
and
the
supply,
yes,
and
it
will
go
on
over
period
varying
from
like
i
say
four
months,
sometimes
a
year
before
they
have
an
income
producing
mine.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
the
stilwell
brothers
always
mined
on
the
rail
and
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
in
one
mine
yes
some
mines
on
a
rail
some
mine
on
rubber.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
it
was
the
mine
operators.
they
have
to
build
a
little
railroad
into
the
mine.
it
was
there.
the
remaining
now
they
take
it
out
or
not
when
they
leave
whether
it's
worth
anything
in
another
mining
operation.
equipment
they
do
use
is
special
equipment
for
this
low
seam
of
coal
only.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
prior
to
1950
they
were
not.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
they
are
deductible,
yes.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
right.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
oh
yes,
you
can
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
you
can
have
that
if
you
have
a
lot.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
right.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
yes
and
for
this
reason.
no,
i
want
to
give
you
my
reasons
for
it
since
i
have
time.
the
question
of
what
represents
a
capital
asset
or
capital
investments
for
purposes
of
depletion
was
decided
long
before
1950.
now,
congress
by
statute
has
said
that
you
can
deduct
these
things
that
otherwise
you
would
recover
through
depletion
but
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
which
is
section
16
indicates
quite
clearly
that
they
did
not
reclassify
them
for
purposes
of
percentage
depletion.
it
was
quite
clear
that
this
was
an
additional
benefit
on
top
of
other
benefits.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
oh
yes.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
no.
no
there's
a
distinction
between
the
cost
depletion
and
the
percentage
depletion.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
there
are
nonetheless
capital
investments
and
they
were
what
this
court
has
spoke
about,
has
meant
when
it
referred
to
capital
investment.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
oh!
no.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
no,
no.
in
fact
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
well
it
depends
on
what
the
purpose
of
the
balance
sheet
was.
if
i
were
go
into
a
banker,
i
would
sure
put
them
on.
actually,
these
people
don't
keep
that
kind
balance
sheets
down
there.
the
records
were
kept
by
a
local
bookkeeper
and
he
--
they're
not
the
kind
of
you've
expect.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
if
i
were
--
if
i
were
given
a
balance
sheet
to
the
internal
revenue
service
i
would
not
put
them
on.
mr.
john
y.
merrell
if
i
were
--
if
i
were
a
certified
public
accountant
were
given
to
a
banker
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
a
loan
i
would
definitely
put
them
on
because
they're
--
mr.
john
y.
merrell
sure.
these
are
development
expenses
which
i
have
incurred
in
connection
with
bringing
a
mine
to
a
development
stage.
i
might
also
add
how
much
coal
is
there
farmed
in
a
mine
at
this
particular
time
and
how
these
were
a
value
to
them.
so
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
state
that
if
you
go
back
to
the
basic
statute,
it's
says
that
the
language
of
this
statute,
this
is
palmer
versus
bender.
it's
broad
enough
to
provide
at
least
for
every
case
in
which
the
taxpayers
acquired
by
investment,
any
interest
in
the
coal
in
place
and
secures
by
any
form
of
legal
relationship
income
derived
from
the
extraction
of
the
mineral
to
which
it
must
look
for
the
return
of
its
capital.
if
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
provide
for
middlemen,
who
can
buy
the
rights
and
transfer
them
to
others
as
in
the
various
oil
cases
which
this
case
is
beside
it,
it
certainly
broad
enough
to
provide
for
the
mine
operators
on
the
basis
of
the
obligations
which
they
assumed
and
performed
in
this
case.
we
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
of
presenting
our
positions.
