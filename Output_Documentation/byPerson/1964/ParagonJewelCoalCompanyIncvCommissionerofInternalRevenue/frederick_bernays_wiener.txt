mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
whether
a
lessee
of
coal
lands
must
share
its
depletion
allowance
with
the
persons
it
hired
to
mine
the
coal
but
who
themselves
never
own
the
coal
while
it
is
was
unmined
in
the
ground
or
own
the
coal
after
it
had
been
extracted.
tax
court
decided
this
question
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
paragon
jewel
and
against
the
respondent
contractors,
the
respondents
in
237.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
we
brought
supp
certiorari
on
the
grounds
of
conflict
with
parsons
against
smith
in
the
359th
united
states
and
the
commissioner
who
fiscally
is
a
stakeholder
agreed
with
us
and
still
agrees
with
us
and
as
your
honors
will
doubtless
discern
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
they
agree
with
us
completely
in
result
and
only
somewhat
--
disagree
only
somewhat
in
emphasis.
i
shall
take
up
first
the
facts
found
by
the
tax
court
concerning
the
agreement,
the
arrangements
between
petitioner
paragon
jewel,
the
lessee,
and
its
contractors.
i
will
then
discuss
the
statute
because
after
all
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
deduction
that
is
accorded
as
a
matter
of
legislative
grace
and
yet
the
court
below
dealt
with
that
deduction
without
discussing
the
statute
without
holding
the
statute
and
without
even
citing
the
statute.
and
then
i
will
take
up
the
common
law
of
depletion
the
decisions
here
to
show
that
the
entire
emphasis
in
your
honors'
decisions
has
been
that
depletion
is
an
allowance
to
the
owner
for
the
exhaustion
of
his
capital
investment
of
his
capital
assets
and
that
therefore
it
isn't
available
to
one
who
never
had
any
capital
investment
in
the
minimum.
let
me
first
deal
with
the
facts
found
by
the
tax
court.
petitioner
paragon
jewel
was
the
assignee
or
the
sub-lessee
of
numerous
coal
leases
in
the
hills
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
it
is
assumed
all
the
obligations
of
the
original
lessee
under
those
leases.
it
paid
all
the
royalties,
it
paid
all
the
property
taxes.
it
never
assigned
or
sublet
any
of
its
leases
and
it
never
surrendered
any
capital
interest
in
the
coal
in
place.
i
pause
to
say
that
the
expression
mineral
in
place,
coal
in
place,
oil
in
place
seems
somehow
confusing
to
some
of
the
lawyers
with
whom
i
have
discussed
it.
i
may
refer
to
it
as
the
coal
in
the
ground.
i
don't
see
that
that's
a
word
of
art
at
all,
that's
perfectly
quite.
now,
paragon
made
contracts
with
various
individual
miners
to
mine
this
coal.
these
contractors
assume
no
obligations
under
the
leases.
they
paid
no
property
taxes
on
the
mineral
on
any
mineral
interest.
they
paid
no
royalties
under
the
leases.
they
paid
nothing
for
the
coal.
they
got
no
title
to
the
coal
either
in
the
ground
or
after
it
was
mined
and
the
great
many
of
them
on
the
stand
expressly
disclaimed
any
capital
investment
in
the
unmined
coals.
they
got
nothing
by
purchase
or
lease.
they
were
not
entitled
to
sell
to
anyone
--
to
any
outsider
the
coal
that
they
mine
for
paragon.
they
had
to
deliver
every
bit
of
coal
they
mine
to
paragon
at
its
tipple
and
in
return
they
got
the
personal
covenant
of
paragon
to
be
paid
for
their
mining
operations
at
a
fixed
price
per
ton.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there
was
none.
no,
it's
plain
that
depletion
is
a
conflict
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
minute
on
whether
it
was
terminable.
there
was
no
negotiation
about
depletion.
actually,
the
depletion
issue
didn't
arrive
even
in
the
bureau
and
even
in
the
tax
court
after
these
contracts
remained.
the
price
fixed
by
paragon
varied
prospectively
so
that
the
contractors
would
know
when
how
much
they
would
get
for
the
next
ton
of
coal
they
mine.
it
was
not
changed
in
the
course
of
mining
and
not
changed
retrospectively
and
the
tax
court
found
that
paragon
could
and
did
change
this
price
at
will.
it
found
also
that
the
contractors
were
not
obligated
to
mine
any
specific
amount
of
coal
and
that
they
were
not
specifically
given
the
right
to
mine
any
particular
area
to
exhaustion.
they
couldn't
be,
because
it
was
impossible
to
determine
in
advance
what
areas
would
be
mined.
for
one
thing,
any
contractor
could
quit
and
the
good
many
of
them
did.
for
another
the
mining
operations
would
uncover
rolls
and
faults
in
the
seams
so
that
it
was
never
possible
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
operation,
you
shall
have
this
track
describing
it
either
by
means
and
bounds
or
by
natural
monuments,
it
just
wasn't
and
paragon
had
an
engineer
to
coordinate
the
mining
of
the
several
contractors
so
that
they
would
work
together,
so
that
they
extract
all
the
mineable
coal
which
paragon
under
its
leases
was
bound
to
do
and
so
they
wouldn't
blow
up
each
other's
tunnels.
now
as
determination,
the
tax
court
said
that
they
couldn't
say
that
the
contract
was
terminable
but
by
the
same
token
they
couldn't
say
it
was
non-terminable
and
they
found
that
nothing
was
said
about
terminability
at
the
time
the
contracts
were
made.
we
think
that
last
finding
is
plainly
wrong
because
a
year-and-a-half
before
any
of
these
petitions
for
review
were
in
the
tax
court,
one
of
the
respondents
in
237
in
two
separate
sworn
documents
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
service
on
behalf
of
all
the
partners
in
two
partnerships
constituting
all
of
these
respondents
set
under
oath,
the
contracts
specified
the
right
of
termination
by
either
party
at
any
time
but
the
question
never
arose
between
the
partnership
in
paragon.
we
say
that
in
view
of
these
ante
motam
litem
admissions
binding
all
the
respondents
that
particular
finding
of
the
tax
court
is
clearly
erroneous.
we
don't
have
to
rest
on
that.
even
without
that
correction,
even
taking
the
findings
of
the
tax
court
as
they
now
stand
we
say
that
on
the
facts
that
they
found
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
never
was
any
transfer
of
capital
interest
in
the
unmined
coal
by
paragon
jewel
to
any
of
these
contractors.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
your
honor,
and
if
i
can
persuade
your
honor
to
pay
me
$300,000
for
the
brooklyn
bridge
that
doesn't
pass
title
to
you
and
these
people
had
no
capital
to
settle.
they
may
have
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
there's
no
question
that
was
terminable
at
will
in
the
first
place
a
lot
of
these
miners
quit.
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
on
that
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
if
a
contractor
is
terminable
at
the
will
of
one
party,
it's
terminable
at
the
will
of
both
and
if
it
weren't
--
if
the
miners
could
quit
but
paragon
couldn't
terminate
them
it
would
lack
mutuality.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
didn't
make
it
--
they
made
an
investment,
yes,
but
not
in
coal.
and
if
--
again,
if
i
can
soft
talk,
your
honor,
into
buying
the
brooklyn
bridge,
that
wouldn't
convey
title
and
that's
what
this
was.
i
don't
know
what
they
represented
that
they
had
to
sell.
they
might
sold
them
machinery.
they
might
have
said,
“look
i
put
in
all
this
wood
and
all
this
timber
and
that
costs
me
a
lot
of
time
and
money
and
blood
and
sweat
and
if
you
want
to
take
my
place
you
got
to
pay
me
something
for
it.”
well,
that
doesn't
mean
they
had
any
interest,
capital
interest
in
the
unmined
coal
which
by
taking
money
from
a
successor
miner.
they
could
then
say
to
paragon,
“see
i
own
the
coal.
i
was
able
to
sell
it
to
the
next
fellow.”
these
miners
didn't
own
the
coal
in
the
ground.
they
admitted
that.
they
never
made
that
claim.
they
didn't
know
that
afterwards,
after
it
was
mined
because
they
weren't
free
to
dispose
of
it
and
the
entire
facts,
the
facts
are
completely
consistent
with
the
capital
investment
in
this
coal
being
in
the
lessee
only
and
none
of
it
being
in
the
contractors
and
none
of
it
ever
having
been
transferred
and
therefore
they
are
not
entitled
to
depletion
and
the
tax
court
so
held
following
parsons
against
smith
where
these
same
arguments
were
made.
now,
the
court
below
found
a
sharing
of
“economic
interest”.
now
for
that,
we
go
back
to
the
opinion
in
palmer
against
bender
in
287
united
states
but
those
words
weren't
used
alone.
what
mr.
justice
stone,
as
he
then
was,
said
an
economic
interest
representing
a
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
in
place.
in
other
words,
we
don't
care
about
legal
title.
we
don't
care
about
the
niceties
of
conveyances
if
there
is
an
ownership
interest
and
economic
interest
representing
a
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
in
place
but
here,
the
economic
interest
is
in
the
enterprise,
the
economic
interest
of
the
contractors
is
in
their
machinery,
it
may
be
in
their
labor
but
they've
never
made
an
investment
in
the
coal
in
place.
now,
let
me
go
to
the
statute
as
i
have
said
--
and
as
any
revenuer
can
always
make
any
tax
lawyer
squirm
every
deduction
is
an
act
of
legislative
grace.
well
then,
we
look
to
the
legislation
and
yet
in
this
case,
the
court
below
was
able
to
deal
with
this
legislated
deduction
without
even
citing
the
statute
much
less
quoting
it
or
discussing.
alright,
let's
go
to
the
basic
provision
which
is
613
(a)
and
i
will
read
only
short
passages.
the
allowance
for
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i'm
reading
from
page
2a
the
appendix
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
the
paragon
jewel's
brief.
section
613
(a)
beginning
of
the
third
line.
the
allowance
for
depletion
under
section
611,
611
is
the
basic
grant
of
that
deduction,
shall
be
the
percentage
specified
in
subsection
b
of
the
gross
income
from
the
property,
so
that
it's
a
percentage
of
gross
income
from
the
property.
now
we
go
over
to
page
at
the
top
of
page
4a
which
is
section
614
(a),
property
means
each
separate
interests
owned
by
the
taxpayer
in
each
mineral
deposit
in
each
separate
track
or
parcel
of
land
and
i
ask
what
mineral
depo
--
what
interest
was
owned
by
these
contractors
in
each
mineral
deposit
in
each
separate
track
of
this
aggregation
of
leases
the
paragon
jewel
had
assembled,
the
answer
is
none.
now,
there
are
additional
reasons,
statutory
reasons
that
lead
to
the
same
result.
for
many
years,
there
has
been
a
provision
in
the
tax
statute
going
back
to
at
least
1918
page
1a,
in
the
case
of
a
lease
the
deduction
under
this
section
shall
be
equitably
apportioned
between
the
lessor
and
lessee.
substantially
similar
language
has
been
on
the
books
for
45
years.
but
by
reason
of
legislation
passed
after
the
tax
years
considered
in
parsons
against
smith,
there
is
no
longer
any
apportionment
in
the
case
of
coal.
the
coal
lessor
gets
capital
gains
treatments
on
his
royalties
and
therefore
no
longer
shares
in
the
depletion
deduction
which
therefore
belongs
indivisibly
to
the
lessee
and
i
ask
where
is
the
statutory
warrant
for
making
the
lessee
share
that
depletion
now
with
the
people
he
simply
hires
to
mine
the
coal.
and
finally,
there
are
further
sections
also
dating
since
--
from
1951
but
sharpened
only
last
year,
which
show
that
congress
understood
very
well
the
difference
between
an
economic
interest
in
the
mineral
and
a
right
to
cut
or
mine
the
mineral.
page
4a,
631
(b),
the
last
three
lines
this
is
the
timber
subsection.
the
term
‘owner'
means,
any
person
who
owns
an
interest
in
such
timber
including
a
sublessor
and
a
holder
of
a
contract
to
cut
timber
and
a
holder
of
a
contract
to
cut
timber.
but
in
the
next
section
over
on
the
next
page
631
(c),
the
word
‘owner'
means
any
person
who
owns
an
economic
interest
in
coal
in
place
including
a
sublessor
and
congress
doesn't
go
on
to
say
and
the
holder
of
a
contract
to
mine
coal
and
that
section
was
amended
only
last
year
in
1964
to
include
with
the
lessor
of
coal,
the
lessor
of
domestic
iron
ore
and
congress
didn't
change
that
language,
so
that
is
perfect
it
is
just
as
clear
as
it
can
possibly
be
from
statutory
language
that
the
holder
of
a
contract
to
mine
coal
is
not
one
of
those
to
whom
congress
has
extended
the
depletion
deduction.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
so
yes,
because
the
--
and
--
in
our
view,
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
important
only
as
they
show
or
fail
to
show
a
transfer
of
capital
interest.
beyond
that
in
mr.
justice
holmes'
phrase,
the
spider's
webs
inadequate
to
control
the
dominant
fact.
i
deprecate
the
kind
of
cases
that
say,
well
if
you
pay
him
a
fixed
price
he
doesn't
get
any
depletion
but
if
you
let
him
have
a
percentage
of
the
market
price
he
does
and
that
sort
of
thing.
in
other
words,
if
i
have
a
contract
to
cut
your
honors'
loan
in
perpetuity
just
for
the
rest
of
my
life,
every
summer,
that
doesn't
give
me
any
capital
interest
in
your
honors'
front
loan
in
the
real
estate
and
that's
what
this
is.
now,
i
am
confirmed
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
but
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
when
you're
cutting
like
--
when
you're
mining
coal,
you
are
not
--
the
contractor
is
depleting
the
asset
of
the
person
who
owns
the
coal.
now,
in
parsons
v.
smith
where
this
thing
was
going
into
a
great
length,
the
key
in
paragraphs,
the
key
passage
is
at
page
220
of
359
u.s.
and
in
the
key
sentences
there
and
i'll
read
them
briefly
omitting
the
citation
the
word
‘owner'
is
used
no
less
than
three
times.
the
purpose
of
the
deduction
for
depletion
is
plain
and
has
been
many
times
declared
by
this
court.
it
is
permitted
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
mineral
deposits
are
wasting
assets
and
is
intended
as
compensation
to
the
owner
for
the
part
used
up
in
production.
the
depletion
exclusion
is
designed
to
permit
a
recoupment
of
the
owner's
capital
investment,
the
owner's
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
so
that
when
the
minerals
are
exhausted,
the
owner's
capital
is
unimpaired.
in
short
--
and
this
is
the
conclusion
of
the
paragraph,
the
purpose
of
the
depletion
deduction
is
to
permit
the
owner
of
a
capital
interest
in
mineral
in
place
to
make
a
tax
brief
recovery
of
that
depleting
mineral
asset.
and
as
far
back
as
thomas
against
perkins
in
the
301
united
states,
the
court
said
ownership
is
essential,
in
the
bankline
case
in
the
303rd
united
states,
chief
justice
hughes
said
the
phrase
‘economic
interest'
is
not
to
be
taken
as
embracing
a
mere
economic
advantage
derived
from
production
through
a
contractual
relation
to
the
owner
by
one
who
has
no
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
deposit,
skipping,
respondent
had
no
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
deposit
which
suffered
depletion
and
is
not
entitled
to
the
statutory
allowance.
now,
that
language
was
taken
over
into
the
regulations
and
it's
there
pretty
much
in
haec
verba
and
it's
there
without
substantial
change
today
on
the
next
to
last
page
--
two
next
to
last
pages
of
the
brief.
an
economic
interest
is
possessed
in
every
case
in
which
the
taxpayer
has
it
acquired
by
investment
any
interest
in
mineral
in
place.
a
person
who
has
no
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
deposit
does
not
possess
an
economic
interest
merely
because
through
a
contractual
relation
he
possess
a
mere
economic
or
pecuniary
advantage
derived
from
production
and
agreement
between
the
owner
of
an
economic
interest
and
another
entitling
the
latter
to
compensation
for
extraction
or
cutting
does
not
convey
a
depletable
economic
interest.
needless
to
say
this
regulation
was
not
mentioned
by
the
court
below.
instead
of
which,
the
court
below
and
the
contractors
here
seek
to
find
an
economic
interest
by
dropping
the
vital
qualification
representing
a
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
in
place
and
say
because
they
have
an
economic
interest
in
the
enterprise
and
because
they
invested
in
things
other
than
the
coal
and
because
they
own
things
other
than
the
coal
which
they
can
deduct
under
other
provisions,
they
have
somehow
presto
change-o
made
a
capital
investment.
we
say
that
is
a
fiction,
this
court
said
it
was
a
fiction,
this
court
dealt
with
the
--
this
precise
question
in
parsons
against
smith.
this
court
rejected
the
fiction,
this
court
said
you
must
find
a
surrender,
a
transfer
of
the
capital
interest
and
since
that
transfer,
since
that
surrender
is
absolutely
lacking
here
except
on
a
wholly
fictitious
basis
we
say
with
the
commissioner
that
the
court
below
disregarded
parsons
against
smith
and
that
its
judgment
must
therefore
be
reversed.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
commissioner
has
very
kindly
yielded
his
remaining
time
to
me
but
since
the
totality
is
only
six
minutes,
i
won't
be
detaining
your
honors
very
long
unlike
them.
i
don't
think
the
court
is
going
to
be
assisted
in
determining
this
case
by
consideration
of
whether
the
competing
taxpayers
are
rich
or
poor
or
by
dealing
with
equality
of
bargaining
power.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
statute
and
the
only
way
we
can
construe
that
statute
properly
is
to
look
at
its
language
to
avoid
fictions,
to
avoid
semantics.
now,
we
have
a
statute
and
its
interpretations
here
notably
parsons
against
smith
say
that
the
deduction
for
depletion
follows
ownership
or
capital
interest
or
capital
investment.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what.
it
is
if
you
please
a
capitalist
statute
that
makes
no
difference
but
it
might
be
a
better
statute
in
some
points
of
view
if
it
were
different.
now,
the
size
of
the
investment
made
is
immaterial.
in
the
parsons'
case
there
was
parsons.his
investment
in
machinery
was
$200,000,
costs
had
$500,000.
now,
every
investment
that
the
contractors
here
have
made
is
deductible.
the
current
expenses
are
deductible
under
section
162.
the
capital
expenses
are
deductible
under
167
and
their
development
expenses
are
deductible
under
616.
the
only
thing
they
can't
deduct
for
is
coal
but
as
mr.
merrell
revealed
in
answering
the
questions
by
mr.
justice
white,
they
didn't
capitalize
their
development
expenses.
they
expensed
in
the
jargon
of
the
tax
technician,
they
expensed
every
penny
they
spent
except
the
investment
in
machinery,
that's
the
only
thing
they
capitalized.
and
it
doesn't
do
any
--
it
doesn't
very
helpful
i
think
to
talk
about
selling
coal.
you
sell
only
what
you
own.
these
contractors
didn't
sell
paragon
its
own
coal.
they
couldn't
take
it
elsewhere.
they
couldn't
give
it
to
anyone
else.
they
couldn't
take
it
on
the
market
to
see
whether
possibly
they
could
make
a
better
bargain
with
someone
else.
it
was
paragons'
coal
they
were
paid
for
mining.
now,
everyone
of
the
seven
factors
here
with
a
possible
exception
of
terminability
on
which
your
honors
rested
in
parsons
v.
smith
is
here,
and
the
one
factor
which
the
court
in
parsons
pointed
to
as
determinative.
the
one
factor
that
dispelled
the
fiction
of
parsons
and
huss
tried
to
persuade
your
honors
to
it
adopt
was
that
there
had
never
been
any
surrender,
any
transfer,
any
conveyance
of
the
capital
interest
in
the
coal
in
the
ground.
now,
the
court
below
disregarded
the
statute,
disregarded
the
regulations
rough
shot
over
the
findings.
used
--
relied
on
authorities
that
were
patently
not
in
point.
relied
on
the
same
kind
of
semantiticized
fiction
that
parsons
v.
smith
rejected
and
reverted
to
the
pre-parsons
decisions
which
it
had
on
the
basis
of
which
parsons
was
brought
here
under
a
conflict.
the
court
below
simply
ignored
parsons
against
smith,
maybe
that
to
paraphrase
alexander
pope
only
very
slightly,
a
court
convinced
against
its
will
is
also
of
the
same
opinion
still
but
if
you
read
paragon
--
parsons
v.
smith
objectively
and
look
at
the
findings
actually
found
here,
then
i
think
your
honors
will
agree
with
the
commissioner
and
with
the
petitioner
paragon
where
there
must
be
a
reversal.
