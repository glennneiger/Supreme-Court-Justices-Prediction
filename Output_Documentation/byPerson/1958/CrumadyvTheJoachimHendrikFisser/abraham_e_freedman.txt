mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
after
all
that
discussion,
i
think
it
might
be
relaxing
to
take
a
little
secret
now.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
two
questions
posed
by
these
proceedings.
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
shipowner
is
responsible
for
an
unsafe
condition
which
is
created
by
an
independent
contractor
in
the
course
of
unloading
operations,
and
the
second
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
may
reverse
a
fact
finding
of
the
trial
judge
sitting
in
admiralty
under
circumstances
where
the
fact
finding
--
where
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge
is
not
shown
to
be
clearly
erroneous
under
the
mcallister
decision
of
this
court.
briefly,
the
circumstances
in
this
case
show
that
mr.
crumady
was
a
longshoreman,
one
of
a
group
of
longshoremen
who
were
engaged
to
discharge
a
cargo
of
lumber
from
this
vessel,
the
joachim
hendrik
fisser,
i'll
call
it
the
fisser
for
purposes
of
convenience,
in
january
of
1954.
he
was
employed
by
the
impleaded
respondent,
the
nacirema
operating
company.
they
went
to
work
on
the
morning
of
january
4th
--
2nd,
1954
and
discharged
most
of
the
cargo
which
had
been
piled
above
the
level
of
the
coaming
here
in
this
hole.
perhaps
i
should
first
state
to
the
court
that
all
of
the
gear
that
your
honors
see
on
this
model
was
designed
for
--
a
three-ton
gear,
designed
with
a
workload
capacity
of
three
tons.
that
is
the
maximum
safe
workload
capacity
of
three
tons.
that
included
these
booms
and
this
gear.
and
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
or
two
to
describe
the
various
parts
of
the
gear
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
will
certainly
be
glad
to
do
so,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
sir,
these
are
the
booms.
this
timber
right
here
is
the
mast.
this
is
the
mast
house
down
here.
it's
the
new
type
--
it's
a
foreign
vessel,
a
german
vessel,
and
this
is
the
port
boom
and
this
is
the
starboard
boom.
now,
the
port
boom
was
called
the
port
as
the
left
side
and
the
starboard
as
the
right
side.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
port
boom
was
used
as
the
so-called
up
and
down
boom.
as
your
honors
can
see,
here
is
a
cable
which
extends
between
the
two
of
them
and
this
cable
is
called
the
runner.
the
runner
is
that
part
of
the
cable
which
attaches
to
the
load
itself,
which
is
to
be
lifted.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
part
right
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
whole
of
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
--
this
one
here
at
the
right.
and
this
is
to
the
cargo,
as
we
explained
earlier,
drop
down
here
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
and
then
it's
lifted
up.
i
wanted
to
say
first,
if
this
is
the
so-called
up
and
down
boom,
this
boom
is
used
as
your
honors
can
see
it,
it
manipulates
these
cables
by
means
of
winches
that
are
located
at
this
point.
they're
not
visible
on
this
model,
but
they're
located
right
here.
so
that
the
pulleys
and
the
cables
on
this
side
lift
it
up,
and
after
this
boom
lifted
up,
then
this
boom
is
used
to
pull
these
cables
over
toward
the
shore
on
the
pier
where
the
cargo
has
landed
about
where
i
am
standing.
now,
when
--
as
i
said
before,
this
is
the
runner
and
these
two
slates
or
cables
which
your
honors
see
here,
this
is
called
a
guy.
a
guy
is
just
another
name
for
another
--
a
number
of
ropes.
and
--
and
this
is
the
so-called
preventer.
preventer
is
just
another
name
for
the
rope.
these
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
respected
booms
here,
while
these
booms
are
taking
the
strain
on
the
cargo
on
the
load
which
is
being
lifted.
and
now,
the
testimony
shows
that
when
this
operation
first
started,
this
boom
here
was
rigged
by
the
crew
so
that
the
head
of
the
boom
was
directly
over
the
center
of
the
hatch
right
here.
now,
as
the
discharging
progressed,
the
longshoreman
moved
this
head
of
the
boom
over
more
towards
the
port
side
so
that
the
head
of
the
boom
was
located
according
to
the
findings
and
the
factual
picture
which
i
am
trying
to
present
is
taken
right
from
the
fact
findings
of
judge
wortendyke
who
was
the
trial
judge.
he
found
that
the
head
of
the
port
boom
was
about
two
thirds,
about
one-third
of
the
way
for
the
center
of
the
hatch
to
the
port
and
it
was
secured
by
this
so-called
preventer
to
the
--
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
just
about
a
switch,
about
pretty
close
to
where
it
is
here.
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
athwart
--
straight
opposite,
sir.
athwartship
means
across
while
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
longitudinal
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
what
they
do
is
they
loosen
the
(inaudible)
sir,
securing
lines
right
here
and
the
others
which
hold
it.
and
they
could
swing
it
over.
there
was
some
testimony
that
the
longshoremen
were
not
permitted
to
move
the
angle
of
the
boom.
the
angle
of
the
boom
is
this
angle
right
from
here,
the
angle
between
the
boom
and
the
mast.
now,
this
cable
from
here
to
here,
which
holds
this
boom
up
is
called
the
topping-lift.
this
is
the
fellow
that
goes
on
the
trouble
that
we're
about
to
come
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
the
question
which
is
not
answered
in
the
record,
sir,
because
as
the
cargo
is
unloaded,
sir,
unloading
cargo
in
one
part
of
the
hatch
may
be
done
very
safely
and
properly
with
the
boom
directly
above.
however,
as
the
cargo
shifts
as
the
sling
shifts
over
further,
the
boom
frequently
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honors
will
find
in
the
agreement,
which
the
respondent
here
alleges
as
the
indemnity
agreement,
your
honors
will
find
in
that
agreement
a
clause
which
says
that
it
is
the
longshoremen
who
are
required
to
what
we
call
trim
the
booms,
move
these
booms
back
and
forth
as
the
cargo
is
being
unloaded
from
time
to
time.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
--
first
of
all,
irrelevant
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
because
--
because
what
it
was
at
that
moment
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
if
it
has
been
in
its
original
position,
i
don't
know
what
the
effect
would
have
been
because
there
are
no
calculations
to
show
what
the
respect
of
strains
would
have
been
from
that
point.
however,
as
the
cargo
has
unloaded,
sir,
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
only
the
function
of
the
vessel,
so
provide
in
the
first
instance
a
seaworthy
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
vessel
but
also
to
maintain
it.
this
court
said
that
in
mahnich
versus
southern
steamship
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
to
keep
it
in
order
throughout
the
entire
(inaudible)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
all
right,
sir.
i
can't
say
whether
the
boom
in
its
original
position
over
the
center
of
the
hatch
could
have
extricated
or
taken
out
the
lumber.
sufficient
to
say
that
the
longshoremen
who
were
then
unloading
it
thought
that
it
needed
trimming,
it
needed
moving
over.and
on
that
point,
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
evidence
as
i
think
my
two
friends
here
will
show.
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
that
argument
because
that
involves
the
question
of
indemnity.
but
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir,
i
take
the
evidence
--
i
take
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no
sir.
and
therefore
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
after
the
longshore
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
after
the
longshoreman
came
aboard,
they
moved
the
boom
as
the
court
found
so
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
one
which
this
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
right
here.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
they
moved
this
boom
to
a
point
just
beyond
this
hatch
board
and
then
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
moved
--
not
down,
just
across.
they
didn't
change
the
angle.
they
just
moved
it
over.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
very
easily
accomplished.
so
long
as
this
cable
right
here
is
not
moved,
is
not
touched,
it
will
swing
the
angle
between
the
boom
and
the
mast
will
not
change.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
they
could
loosen
these
preventers
and
the
guy.
these
guylines
will
swing
it
over
and
also
this
runner
right
here,
too.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
swing
it
over
to
support
to
the
left
side.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
what
was
done
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
then
--
then
the
longshoremen,
(inaudible),
secured
according
to
judge
wortendyke's
findings,
secured
this
preventer
to
avoid
athwartship
at
this
point
and
the
guylines
to
a
point
approximately
this
point.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
longshore
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
longshoreman
was
in
the
hatch
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
and
they
were
unloading
these
timbers
and
there
were
two
timbers
that
they
were
trying
to
get
out
of
this
hole.
they
were
lining
longitudinally
this
way,
longer
than
this,
they
were
almost
right
to
the
hatch
about
35
feet.
and
one
of
them
was
under
the
coaming
here.
they
took
a
sling
and
tied
it
around
these
two
timbers
near
the
after-end
and
then
they
put
the
sling
all
at
this
way
to
make
the
top.
and
--
and
the
string
was
on
this
boom
right
here
as
it
was
rigged
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
boom
right
here,
yes,
sir.
and
as
they
started
the
court
found
that
they
first
took
a
little
--
took
the
slack
out.
and
when
they
first
secured
--
there's
got
to
beat
some
slack
in
this
runner
right
here.
they
first
--
the
winchman
first
took
the
slack
out
and
then
he
put
what
he
called
a
strain
on
it.
and
then
as
he
put
the
strain
on
it,
this
thing
rolled
or
slid
unto
the
coaming
and
the
court
found
that
he
continued
to
apply
the
pressure
even
slightly
and
at
that
point,
this
topping-lift
right
here
rolled.
the
hatch
came
--
this
boom
here,
it
came
down
and
struck
the
man
down
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
lower
the
boom
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
broke,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
a
wire,
wire
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
(inaudible)
steel
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it's
--
(inaudible),
yes,
sir.
this
topping-lift
was
wrapped
in
--
was
rigged
in
what
they
call
the
double
purchase.
that
means
this
--
this
cable
here
was
smaller
or
(voice
overlap)
from
this
but
there
were
two
of
them
up
here
and
a
double
purchase,
so
that
as
to
give
it
the
necessary
strength.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
--
the
trial
judge
found
that
this
rope,
because
of
two
factors,
two
reasons,
he
said
that
these
two
lines
right
here,
this
guy
and
this
so-called
preventer
were
placed
at
a
wrong
angle.
they
should
have
been
back
here,
but
being
here,
they
placed
a
greater
strain
on
this
topping-lift
right
here
as
this
runner
was
pulling
this
up
front
against
this
timber
out.
now
then,
that
was
the
first
factor.
therefore
the
court
held
--
the
lower
court
found
that
it
was
the
improper
positioning,
the
improper
rigging
of
this
boom
over
too
far
without
securing
this
two
properly,
that
is
the
defect
of
securing
so
to
speak,
plus
one
other
factor
which
i
have
not
yet
referred
to,
and
that
is
that
the
winch
which
powered
the
entire
operation
was
equipped
with
a
governor,
a
cut-off
device
or
a
circuit
breaker
as
it
has
been
variously
characterized
here
to
stop
the
winch.
now,
as
i
said
before,
all
of
these
equipments,
including
the
booms
and
the
tack
and
everything
else
had
a
rated
three-ton
capacity,
maximum
safe
working
load
of
three
tons.
and
on
this
occasion,
however,
the
captain
himself
testified
that
this
governor
was
such
as
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
governor
and
the
winch.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
governor
inside
the
winch.
the
governor
which
regulated
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
the
current
in
the
motor.
that
was
set
to
stop
the
current
at
slightly
more
than
six
tons
which
was
more
than
100%
overload
beyond
the
maximum
safe
working
capacity.
so
that
judge
wortendyke
found
that
the
accident
resulted
from
a
combination
of
these
two
factors.
first,
because
this
boom
was
placed
in
such
a
position
at
least
not
the
boom
as
much
as
the
rigging
itself.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
opinion
doesn't
say
exactly
where
it
was
before,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
that
the
evidence
shows
that
nacirema
did
change
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
one
of
the
longshoremen.
the
governor
--
no,
the
winch
--
the
governor
on
the
winch
was
not
to
be
touch
by
anyone.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
set,
one
said,
it
was
left
alone.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
was
set
in
slightly
more
than
six
by
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
ship
itself.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
was
wrong.
that's
just
what
judge
wortendyke
said.
and
that
was
one
of
the
--
that's
one
of
the
points
here
which
we
--
which
we
make
and
holding
and
contending
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
erroneous
in
overruling
judge
wortendyke's
finding
on
that
specific
point,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
it
was
set
at
six,
six
tons,
it
would
--
it
would
mean
that
there
would
be
a
strain
of
six
tons
imposed
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
pressure
or
strain
on
these
lines
which
were
designed
only
for
a
maximum
of
three
tons.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
sir
--
your
honors
may
not
even
have
to
read
--
that's
a
fact
finding
but
we
say
to
your
honors,
that
even
before
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
(voice
overlap)
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
would
absolutely
be.
as
a
matter
fact,
sir,
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
we
--
we
relied
on
and
--
and
going
up
on
appeal,
we
were
the
appellees,
sir.
we
were
the
appellees
here
and
we
relied
on
that.
but
then
the
court
of
appeals
sua
sponte
then
held
that
this
accident
happened
because
the
rigging
here
was
better
had
been
tucked
by
the
longshoreman
and
this
didn't
make
any
difference.
then
for
the
first
time
on
rehearing,
we
said
to
the
court
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
who
rigged
it.
it
was
the
ship's
obligation
to
rig
it.
and
if
they
delegated
the
job
to
somebody
else
and
it
was
done
wrong,
they're
responsible
for
it.
as
this
--
as
the
court
said
in
the
grillea
case
and
other
cases
that
i'm
prepared
to
argue
that
i
will
cite
your
honors.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
here's
what
he
said.
he
said
that
although
the
maximum
safe
rated
workload
was
only
three
tons,
however,
he
said
as
a
--
it
had
a
tensile
strength
of
five
times
that
much.
he
said
it
had
a
factor
of
safety
of
five.
he
took
the
testimony
which
said
that
all
of
these
cables
have
a
factor
of
safety
of
five
and
he
assumes
from
that
that
it
had
a
work
capacity,
five
times
the
safe
working
load.
and
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
--
from
the
correct
position
because
when
you
say
you
have
a
factor
of
safety
of
five,
you're
not
talking
about
the
work
capacity.
you
are
talking
about
the
breaking
point.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
judge
hastie's
point
was
that
this
positioning
of
the
boom
was
wrong,
it
was
unseaworthy
but
it
had
been
done
by
the
longshoreman.
and
therefore
the
ship
was
not
responsible.
we
didn't
even
argue
that
point.
we
didn't
even
know
that
the
case
was
going
to
turn
on
that
point.
we
had
relied
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
--
an
overload
of
a
100%
on
the
governor.
however,
judge
hastie
said
that
this
was
wrong
and
then
he
came
to
the
other
point,
sir,
and
he
said
that
with
respect
to
the
governor
in
the
winch,
he
said
that
didn't
make
any
difference
because
the
factor
of
safety
of
five
really
gave
the
cables
a
working
capacity
of
15
tons
and
not
merely
of
three
tons.
well,
that's
definitely
incorrect.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
here's
the
policy
in
that
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
most
of
what
you
have
said
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
judge
hastie
found
that
this
thing
had
a
capacity
really
--
a
work
capacity
of
15
tons,
he
said
so
specifically.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
every
witness
in
the
case
including
the
respondent
said
that
the
breaking
load,
not
the
work
capacity,
it
didn't
have
a
working
--
it
has
a
breaking
load
of
five
times.
and
the
minute
you
get
over
the
three
tons,
you
are
testing
the
risk.
now
judge
hastie
said
that
the
fact
that
this
governor
was
set
at
six
tons
was
not
unsafe
even
though
it
was
a
100%
overload
because
this
cable
really
had
a
safe-work
capacity
of
15
tons
rather
than
three.
that's
the
--
that's
the
entire
(voice
overlap)
for
which
judge
hastie
said
that.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
exactly
sir.
if
i
may
state
to
your
honors
that
if
we
were
to
sue
the
manufacturer
on
the
basis
of
judge
hastie's
opinion,
he
would
consider
"high
figures."
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
plainly
marked
on
all
of
the
gear,
maximum
safe
rated
capacity,
three
tons.
if
we
had
gone
over
the
three
tons
and
it
had
broken
for
any
reason,
the
manufacturer
could
have
very
successfully
have
defended
and
said,
"you
disobeyed
the
very
instructions
of
running
the
cable
itself.
it
was
designed
only
for
three
tons.
as
soon
as
you
get
over
the
three
tons,
you
are
testing
the
risk."
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
factors.
this
cable
had
been
in
use
since
its
inception
about
a
year
and
a
half
when
the
vessel
was
first
launched.
the
testimony
shows
that
with
normal
wear
and
tear,
this
wasn't
frequently
used
in
the
caribbean,
very
quick
--
this
particular
boom,
this
equipment.
and
it
shows
that
normal
wear
and
tear
reduces
the
work
capacity,
even
the
maximum
factor
of
safety
which
in
turn,
as
the
court
found,
reduces
the
general
effect
of
the
general
maximum
safe
working
load
of
three
tons.
however,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that.
i
think
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
it
had
been
set
at
three
tons,
this
never
would
have
happened,
sir,
because
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
nothing
would
have
happened,
it
would
shut
off.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
as
soon
as
three
tons
fitted,
it
would
have
gone
off.
i
should
--
i
should
say
this
to
your
honors
that
judge
wortendyke
found
that
the
matter
in
which
this
was
rigged
imposed
a
greater
strain
on
this
topping-lift
gear
than
what
was
imposed
upon
the
gear.
we
said
that
when
--
you
see,
the
evidence
shows
also
and
this
was
admitted
by
the
defendant
that
if
to
the
accident
they
--
he
went
into
the
mast
house
and
he
found
that
the
governor,
the
switch
for
the
governor
had
thrown
--
had
turned,
that
meant
that
the
governor
had
gone
off
and
had
meant
that
at
least
more
than
six
tons
strain
had
already
been
imposed
on
the
gear.
how
much
more
judge
wortendyke
said
i
don't
know
but
it
was
at
least
six.
the
strain
on
this
part
right
here,
judge
wortendyke
found,
was
somewhere
between
17
and
21
tons.
that's
what
he
said
and
spoke
of
it.
now,
if
this
had
been
down
to
three,
the
evidence
shows
that
in
this
position
the
--
the
strain
upon
this
cable
is
many
times
what
it
is
on
this
runner
right
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
a
combination,
the
trial
judge
found
it
was
a
combination
of
the
repositioning
of
the
boom
with
the
improper
rigging
of
these
two
lines
plus
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
plus
the
exact
setting
of
the
governor
of
the
winch.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
longshoreman.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
not
to
rigging,
yes.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
at
the
ship.
that's
right,
sir.
they
didn't
even
know
about
that.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
sir.
they
don't
--
first
of
all,
there's
no
finding
on
that.
there
were
no
statistics
on
it.
there's
no
evidence
on
it
so
far
as
i
know.
the
--
the
calculations
which
are
in
evidence
are
solely
--
are
restricted
to
the
angle
of
the
boom
as
to
the
existence
of
how
many
aspects.
what
they
would
have
been
in
the
original
position,
we
don't
know.
in
addition,
i
may
say
that
the
accident
probably
would
have
happened
if
the
governor
was
at
three
tons,
then
it
would
have
shut
off
before
the
strain
got
to
any
dangerous
level.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
no
your
honor,
it
couldn't
have
because
the
more
of
a
strain
that
you
put
on
this
topping-lift
disproportionately
--
the
more
of
a
strain
is
imposed
--
rather,
the
more
of
the
strain
you
put
on
its
runner,
this
is
the
runner,
the
more
of
a
strain
disproportionately
goes
up
like
something
like
income
taxes
on
this
--
the
topping-lift
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
what
--
that's
what
judge
wortendyke
found
but
he
found
also
that
the
strain
on
this
one,
on
this
runner
was
an
excess
of
six
tons
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
here's
the
--
here's
the
point
your
honor.
if
we
have
--
let's
read
this
mathematically.
if
we
have
a
strain
of
three
tons
on
this
one,
the
--
if
we
have
strain
--
first
of
all,
let's
take
the
calculations
of
judge
wortendyke.
he
said
there
was
more
than
a
strain
of
six
on
this
one,
let's
take
six.
and
then
he
said
that
there
was
a
strain
of
18
on
this
one.
that
means
three
times
as
much.
now,
if
we
had
reduced
to
its
proper
level,
three.
and
this
had
been
three
on
this
runner
right
here
and
we
would
--
the
maximum
that
we
would
have
gotten
here
would
be
nine,
maximum
nine,
probably
a
little
less
because
i
said
this
increases
disproportionately
above.
so
that
actually,
the
strain
on
this
while
it
would've
always
have
been
more
than
the
strain
on
this
runner
right
here.
nevertheless,
it
would
have
been
within
reasonable
limits
and
wouldn't
have
broke
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
governor
had
been
set
--
if
had
been
set
to
go
off
at
three,
there
wouldn't
have
been
anymore
of
a
strain
on
here
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
than
half
of
what
it
did
go,
that
nine,
and
actually
broke
at
18,
the
17
to
21
the
judge
found.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
evidence
shows
that
as
the
--
it's
controlled
by
the
weight
of
the
load
being
lifted.
as
the
weight
of
the
load
increases
--
well,
if
--
when
the
weight
of
the
load
exceeded
six
tons
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it's
beyond
safety.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
put
it
into
play.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
there's
been
a
lot
of
--
there
were
a
lot
of
terms
used
in
the
evidence.
i
used
the
term
governor
because
it's
one
which
we
sometimes
know
about
on
an
automobile
but
i
don't
responsibly
be
able
to
characterize
it.
the
circuit
breaker,
you
could
--
it's
been
called
a
circuit
breaker,
a
governor
or
cut
off.
but
they
all
mean
the
same
thing
that
is,
that
--
as
the
load
reaches
a
certain
point,
or
exceeds
a
certain
point
it
shut
the
power
off
in
the
winch.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
the
circuit
breaker
is
supposed
to
stop
it
when
it
exceeds
that
level.
and
if
you
expose,
i
think
from
that
point,
i
think
this
court
would
find
from
--
as
a
matter
of
judicial
knowledge
that
if
you
exceed
the
safe,
maximum
workload
of
a
particular
cable,
you'll
have
an
unseaworthy
condition,
you'll
have
an
unseaworthy
device.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
--
this
wire
was
wire
cable.
all
of
it
was
wire
cable
except
this
guy
right
in
here,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
they
--
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
libellant
in
this
case
contended
that
this
--
there
was
a
sharp
dispute
whether
this
topping-lift
here
was
defective.
and
in
fact,
produced
a
length
of
cable
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
cut
at
the
time
of
the
accident
but
the
ship
produced
another
one
but
the
court
believed
the
ships
had
the
right
cable
--
ship
had
the
right
cable
and
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
have
the
right
cable.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right.
i
have
a
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
have
to
take
that
assumption,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
sir,
you
have
three-ton
booms,
you
have
10-ton
booms
and
each
one
is
designed
for
a
different
operation.
now
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
there's
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
there
is
stipulation
in
the
record
in
fact,
sir,
that
all
of
the
gear
was
designed
for
three
tons.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
gear
and
the
boom,
and
the
winch,
in
fact,
and
the
winch.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that
--
well
that's
--
that's
implicit
in
the
stipulation
that
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
your
honor,
we'll
find
it
right
in
the
mid
--
right
at
the
beginning
of
judge
wortendyke's
opinion
starting
at
about
14,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
16,
sir,
second
paragraph,
about
one-third
of
the
page
down.
at
the
commencement
of
the
trial,
the
following
facts
were
stipulated.
one,
the
topping-lift
which
admittedly
permitted
the
boom
to
pull
had
been
rigged
and
installed
following
the
launching
of
the
vessel
in
june
1952.
that
was
a
year
and
a
half
before,
and
had
not
been
replaced
prior
to
the
accident
here
involved.
two,
the
port
up
and
down
boom
winch
which
has
been
operated
at
the
time
of
the
topping-lift
cable
quarter
had
also
been
installed
following
the
launching
of
the
vessel,
had
a
rate
of
three
times
capacity
with
an
18
german
horsepower.
this
winch
was
equipped
with
a
device
which
automatically
interrupted
this
operation
upon
the
application
of
a
burden
exceeding
the
capacity
of
the
winch.
now
later
on,
we
--
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
captain
himself
who
admitted
that
this
governor,
this
circuit
breaker
and
the
winch
was
set
at
slightly
more
than
six
tons.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
there
--
there
is
a
very
--
there
is
a
point
which
they
don't
permit
--
there
is
a
post
of
regulation
which
came
into
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
there
was
--
it
was
very
vaguely
referred
to
by
the
experts
of
the
trial
but
never
really
introduced
them
to
the
evidence
judicially
or
otherwise.
and
it
says
that
in
certain
motors,
it
does
not
say
winch,
it
just
says
in
motors,
certain
motors
that
the
circuit
breaker
maybe
set
in
certain
motors
at
250%
of
current.
now,
that
does
not
say,
sir,
that
it's
not
over
100%
overload
of
the
loading
method.
and
the
evidence
here
shows
that
the
circuit
--
this
circuit
breaker
was
set
to
go
off
when
the
load
being
lifted
was
more
than
six
tons.
now
the
evidence
also
shows
that
even
though
it
takes
more
current
--
it
may
take
more
current
than
an
100%,
the
lift
recants,
but
whatever
current
they
take,
they
should
not
impose
more
current
than
is
required
the
lift
to
recant
because
the
minute
they
go
over
the
three-ton
strain,
they
are
testing
the
risk
in
the
cable,
exceeding
at
safe-workload
capacity.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
the
--
the
testimony
shows
that
in
order
to
lift
three
tons,
you've
got
to
have
something
more
than
a
100%
of
current
because
if
you
just
matched
the
current
with
the
three
tons,
it
won't
lift
it.
it's
--
it's
like
if
you
weigh
a
100
and
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right,
sir.
so
you
set
that
for
circuit
breaker,
it's
lightly
a
high
figured.
now
i
don't
know
how
much
higher
but
the
testimony
in
this
case
shows
that
whatever
the
current
might
have
been
in
the
winch,
the
captain
himself
says
that
it
was
said
to
go
off
after
the
workload
exceeded
six
tons
not
current
but
six
tons,
that's
the
testimony,
over
six
tons.
and
where
judge
hastie
went
wrong
was
in
assuming
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
exactly,
sir,
exactly.
and
i
can
refer
your
honor
to
the
testimony
that
you
desire
by
the
captain
himself
who
is
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it's
in
the
brief,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
captain
peters,
captain
of
the
vessel
who
was
there
supervising
the
construction
of
the
ship
so
testified.
he
knows
--
he
know
a
great
deal
about
it.
he
was
perhaps
obviously
someone
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
you
mean
the
excess
currents?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
didn't
say
--
they
didn't
relate
to
two.
they
did
say
--
the
respondent's
experts
said
that
it
takes
more
than
a
100%
of
current
to
lift
the
--
a
weight
of
three
tons.
they
have
to
have
a
little
more
than
100%.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
did
not
say
that,
no,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
had
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
it.
but
whatever
the
current
that
was
required,
the
testimony
is
--
does
show
that
it
was
set
at
six
tons
and
not
at
so
much
current.
i
had
planned
to
take
30
minutes
of
my
time
from
my
original
argument
and
i
had
not
yet
touched
on
my
main
point.
i
like
to
just
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
there's
no
specific
evidence
sir,
except
that
the
--
to
take
the
findings
of
judge
wortendyke
as
we
must,
the
pole,
the
strain
on
the
logs,
i
would
say
exceeded
considerably
the
weight
of
the
logs
themselves,
the
strain
when
they
were
caught
underneath
the
coaming,
underneath
this
--
this
court
right
here.
so
that
actually,
if
--
if
the
governor
had
been
set
properly,
it
would
have
shut
the
current
off
before
it
exceeded
the
proper
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh,
yes.
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
mate
admitted
that
after
the
accident
happened,
he
went
down
and
he
looked
on
the
mast
out
here
and
he
found
that
the
switch
had
been
thrown.
that
isn't
meant
that
the
governor
had
shut
off
and
that
meant
that
the
weight
of
the
load
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
that
the
weight
of
the
load
had
exceeded
six
tons.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
that's
the
pole,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh,
oh
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
timber
was
caught
underneath,
so
that
we
have
no
way
of
determining
at
that
point
how
much
the
weight
of
the
timber
was.
as
i
said,
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
would
say
it
would
be
very
close
to
it,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
record
does
not
show
that,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
close
to
the
three
tons.
i
would
assume
that
the
--
taking
two
logs,
the
logs
were
8x10
or
12x12
and
they
were
35
feet
long.
that's
a
pretty
good
lot
of
weight.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
is
not
in
evidence,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
just
speculating
on
that
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
right.
and
he
said
the
weight,
you
see,
the
governor
is
put
into
operation
by
the
weight
of
the
load
being
lifted
which
is
the
pole
here.
now,
as
soon
as
this
thing
arrived
in
a
strain,
if
it
has
been
set
at
three
tons,
soon
as
it
--
they
got
the
three
tons,
it
would
have
shut
off
the
--
shut
the
motor
off
as
it
was
and
exceeded
six
tons
which
meant
that
the
strain
on
this
topping-lift
was
building
up
disproportionately
high.
and
if
it
had
been
set
at
the
original
three
tons
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir
your
honor.
that's
exactly
right,
sir.
and
as
i
said,
the
judge
--
there
were
two
factors
which
judge
wortendyke
found
were
the
course
of
the
accident.
one
was
the
improper
positioning
of
these
two
guys,
plus
the
unseaworthy
winch
as
they
called
it.
now,
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
118,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh,
yes.
if
your
honor
will
--
will
read
it,
we'll
refer
to
this
part.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
is
judge
hastie's
opinion
but
the
conflict
was
judge
wortendyke.
he
says
15
tons
capacity
and
again
immediately,
the
sentence
--
immediately
proceeding
says,
thus
gear
rated
to
handle
a
three
ton
load,
utilizes
cable
adequate
to
withstand
a
strain
of
15
tons
and
that's
not
corrected.
it's
disputed
by
every
witness
in
the
case
including
the
respondent.
it's
not
adequate
to
withstand
a
strain
of
15
tons.
at
15
tons,
we
know
that
that
cable
is
going
to
break.
if
the
--
the
test
on
the
cable
shows
that
it's
supposed
to
break
at
15
tons,
maybe
or
less.
now,
actually
when
the
manufacturer
manufactures
any
product,
a
cable
or
any
kind
of
a
product,
and
he
puts
a
safe
workload
on
it
whether
it's
a
grinding
wheel,
he
says
it
shouldn't
go
faster
than
then
so
many
revolutions
and
so
on.
the
minute
you
get
above
that
safe
workload
and
thought
to
deteriorate
to
the
point
where
it
ultimately
breaks
and
just
like
if
i
were
to
take
this
stick
and
start
bending
it
as
i
am
now,
it
would
reach
a
point,
if
i
go
beyond
the
point
that
i
have
it
right
now,
it
would
actually
start
to
crack.
it
would
be
irreversible
damage.
the
next
time
we
use
this
stick,
it
would
not
have
the
same
capacity
that
it
has
right
now.
but
now
judge
hastie
said
that
when
you
get
to
the
15
tons,
it
can
withstand
the
strain
of
15
tons.
that's
absolutely
wrong.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it's
a
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
probably,
i
--
(inaudible)
i
tried.
well,
the
point
is
that
the
minute
you
get
over
the
three
tons,
you
start
testing
the
rest
because
you
don't
know
at
what
point
that
cable
is
going
to
be
kept
at
right.
judge
wortendyke
therefore
found
it
was
an
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
would
say
that
judge
hastie
took
a
--
as
he
called
a
mathematical
calculation
which
was
clearly
erroneous
and
in
direct
conflict
with
judge
wortendyke's
finding.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
record
will
not
sustain
that,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
that's
where
he's
wrong
and
for
this
reason
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
it
--
yes
sir,
absolutely
and
here
his
word
contradicts
it.
the
record
says
that
the
cable
at
15
tons
would
break
that
nothing
had
had
the
capacity
to
withstand
the
strain
of
15
tons.
the
record
says
that
it
did
not
have
a
capacity
of
15
tons.
that's
the
breaking
point,
the
record
says
and
i
said
it
forth
at
least
from
every
witness,
i've
said
it
forth
on
my
brief,
every
witness
says
that
the
breaking
point
is
15
tons.
now,
judge
hastie
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
my
point
is
that
judge
hastie's
statement
is
based
on
the
premise
that
this
cable
had
a
weight
working
capacity
of
15
tons.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
on
page
--
on
page
30,
i
think
it's
30
and
31.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
here's
what
judge
wortendyke
said
at
the
bottom
of
page
31.
i
may
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
page
30,
judge
wortendyke
also
makes
a
very
pertinent
observation
when
he
says
--
after
he
talks
about
what
mr.
justice
brennan
said
before
was
the
continued
application
of
the
power.
he
says
that
it
was
the
continued
application
of
the
power
which
caused
this
topping-lift
to
break.
then,
he
goes
on
to
say
and
i
may
say
that
my
friend
says
that
judge
wortendyke
found
--
made
that
statement
and
made
that
finding
out
of
the
course
of
the
accident,
but
that's
not
so
at
all
because
here's
what
judge
wortendyke
says
starting
at
the
middle
of
page
30.
immediately
after
he
talks
about
that
--
the
winchman's
continued
application.
he
says,
“the
question
immediately
arises.
why
did
the
power
running
through
the
winch
failed
to
shut
off
automatically
if
and
when
an
excessive
load
was
built
up
as
above
concluded?
assuming
the
respective
dimensions
of
safe
working
loads
of
the
respective
components
of
the
gear,
the
positions
of
the
courtroom
and
its
preventer
and
guy,
the
direction
of
the
cargo
runner
extending
from
the
boom
heads
to
the
sling
around
the
two
timbers
and
the
obstruction
by
the
lower
edge
of
the
standard
hatch
coaming
to
the
movement
into
the
hatch
square
of
the
offshore
timber.
respondent's
witness
stuart,
and
he
goes
on
to
talk
about
the
amount
of
pounds
that
were
calculated
by
the
stuart
--
by
the
witness
stuart
at
about
21
tons.
and
then
he
says
it
is
apparent
therefore
that
the
topping-lift
quarter
under
a
stain
of
between
17
and
21
tons,
several
times
the
safe
workload
of
the
topping-lift
and
the
other
components.
now,
going
down
--
back
down
to
the
bottom
of
page
31,
the
last
paragraph,
the
witness
cited
that
what
ultimately
shuts
the
current
off
is
the
resistance
to
the
horsepower
of
the
motor
to
be
found
in
the
load
which
is
being
lifted.
there
was
testimony
uncontradicted
that
after
the
boom
had
had
fallen,
bust
under
--
to
operate
the
winch,
noticed
the
cut
off
device
have
functioned
through
a
switch
necessary
to
restore
current
flow
and
then
demonstrated
that
the
winch
operated
perfectly.
the
cut
off
device
was
susceptible
of
being
so
adjusted
as
to
operate
automatically
at
different
degrees
of
excess
load
on
the
gear.
in
this
case
apparently,
the
device
was
set
to
function
at
a
much
lighter
load
than
was
imposed
upon
the
gear
although
it
was
set
to
operate
at
a
load
slightly
more
than
twice
the
safe
work
load
of
the
topping-lift.
now,
my
opinion
that
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
now,
if
your
honor
will
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes.
now,
if
your
honor
will
read
the
last
sentence
on
page
33,
the
last
sentence.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir,
that's
the
one.
i
find
that
it
failed
to
exercise
that
degree
of
care
and
that
as
a
result
thereof,
have
broaden
to
play
the
unseaworthy
condition
of
the
vessel
and
there
he's
talking
about
the
governor
on
the
winch,
the
excess
level
on
the
winch
for
which
the
latter
would
be
liable
in
damages
under
the
principles
annunciated
to
a
court
sieracki
and
the
other
cases.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
take
in
rebuttal,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
may
it
please
court.
in
view
of
the
limited
amount
of
time
which
i
have,
may
i
have
lead
to
file
a
reply
brief
to
answer
quite
a
number
of
the
comments
which
have
been
made,
which
i
believe
are
contradicted
in
the
record.
i
would
like
to
specifically
point
out
those
portions
in
the
record
which
are
inconsistent
with
what
my
good
friend
over
here
has
stated.
i
--
i
don't
have
time
to
do
it
now.
i
would
--
unless,
your
honors,
ask
me
specific
questions.
however,
i
would
like
to
summarize
very
briefly
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
of
course,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
an
order
that
he
should
have
an
opportunity.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it
is
our
position,
sir,
that
this
court
has
established
the
beyond
to
venture
that
the
shipowner
has
a
non-delegable
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work,
on
board
the
ship
for
the
longshoreman
as
well
as
the
seaman.
that
he
may
not
delegate
that
duty
although
he
may
delegate
the
job
and
if
the
job
is
performed
improperly
then
the
shipowner
is
liable.
we
had
not
go
insofar
in
this
case
as
to
state
that
for
negligence
alone
the
shipowner
is
responsible,
although
i
think
that
we
would
be
completely
justified
in
taking
that
position
on
the
basis
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
case
of
the
dixon
versus
united
states
where,
your
honor,
passed
aside
the
question
of
whether
unseaworthiness
is
involved
and
said
that
the
shipowner
is
liable
on
the
basis
of
his
non-delegable
duty
to
the
people
on
the
vessel
for
the
negligence
of
an
independent
contractor.
however,
what
we
say
here
is
based
more
on
the
petterson
case
which
your
honors
handed
down
following
the
decisions
in
sieracki
and
in
hawn
and
mahnich
versus
southern
steamship
company.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
mahnich?
no,
sir.
mahnich
is
the
case
where
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
map
case?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
that
was
not
the
mahnich
case,
your
honors.
that
was
--
i
think
that
case
was
associated
with
ron
where
there
were
a
number
of
weather
request
missing
too
in
a
court,
this
court
or
rather
a
lower
court
held
the
vessel
unseaworthy
because
she
was
not
properly
equipped
with
the
proper
charts
and
so
on.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
charts,
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
weather
--
weather
maps
and
so
on.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
court
held
there.
now
here,
following
your
honor's
decision
in
the
petterson
case
in
which,
your
honors,
will
recall
that
the
shipowner
was
held
liable
for
a
defective
block
which
had
been
brought
aboard,
supplied
and
brought
aboard
by
the
longshoreman.
following
that
in
the
case
of
grillea,
judge
hand
speaking
for
the
second
circuit
had
this
set
of
facts
before
him.
there
were
--
the
longshoremen
were
engaged
on
that
vessel
at
that
time
and
replacing
the
hatch
boards.
and
after
some
of
the
hatch
boards
had
been
replaced,
some
of
the
men
who
were
engaged
in
that
very
practice
stepped
on
one
of
the
hatch
boards
which
was
set
on
top
of
the
pot-eye
and
therefore
unsteady,
and
down
he
went
into
the
hole.
it
was
conceded
that
it
was
a
negligent
act
in
putting
it
there
by
this
very
longshoreman.
however,
the
court
there
held
that
pursuant
to
your
honors
decision
in
the
petterson
case,
it
was
an
unsafe
condition
for
which
the
shipowner
was
responsible
regardless
of
whether
the
condition
was
created
by
the
longshoreman
or
by
the
ship
--
the
ship
itself.
now,
similarly
here,
sir,
we
say
that
the
condition
which
was
created
here
whether
it
was
by
the
ship
or
whether
it
was
by
the
longshoreman
was
a
terribly
dangerous
and
unseaworhty
one.
aside
of
the
cut
off
device
completely,
let
me
cite
to
your
honors,
judge
hastie's
decision
or
part
of
his
decision
which
he
sets
forth
on
page
113
of
the
record.
my
friend
here
has
said
that
the
exclusive
and
sole
factor
which
was
the
approximate
course
of
the
accident
was
the
negligence
of
the
winch
operator
in
continuing
to
apply
pressure.
as
a
matter
of
fact
neither
courts
so
held,
neither
courts
so
find.
here
is
what
judge
hastie
said
which
was
the
--
as
to
what
was
the
deciding
factor,
“the
decisive
fact
--
this
is
the
second
paragraph
about
down
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in
record,
page
113,
“the
decisive
fact
as
the
court
found
it
was
that
the
employees
of
the
nacirema
had
so
changed
the
position
of
the
head
of
the
boom
as
to
seriously
distort
the
normal
composition
of
forces
which
is
presented
by
a
straight
lifting
operation.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
topping-lift
was
subjected
to
an
enormous,
abnormal,
and
unanticipated
strain.”
it
was
on
a
basis
of
that
unsafe
condition
therefore
and
we
urge
your
honors
that
on
a
basis
of
that
alone
there
should
be
liability
in
this
case.
and
my
friend's
contention
that
the
courts
below
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
liability
on
the
ship.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
exactly,
sir.
any
unsafe
condition.
your
honor
--
your
honors
said
it
petterson
versus
alaska
steamship
company
that
the
ship
has
the
non-delegable
duty.
it
may
delegate
the
work
but
it
cannot
delegate
that
duty.
if
it
engages
nacirema
or
any
other
independent
contractor
to
perform
the
work,
it
is
responsible
for
the
unsafe
conditions
which
may
be
created.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir,
when
a
ship
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
--
if
your
honor
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
understand
your
honor's
question.
if
your
honor
is
saying
that
while
a
ship
is
in
the
control
of
the
vessel
owner
or
while
the
ship
was
being
manned
by
its
crew
and
it
engages
an
independent
contractor
to
perform
certain
work,
let
us
say,
it
engages
instead
of
just
normal
stevedoring
work.
let's
say
it
engages
a
caterer
to
conduct
the
services
in
the
stewards
department.
and
that
caterer
obtains
a
very
bad
food
as
a
result
of
which
the
crew
is
poisoned.
this
ship,
let
us
say,
was
entirely
careful
in
selecting
a
good
caterer,
a
reputable
caterer
and
even
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
as
a
matter
of
a
fact,
that
was
the
--
that
was
almost
the
bare
statement
which
this
court
made
in
mahnich.
in
the
old
days
under
the
general
maritime
law
before
the
jones
act
was
handed
down,
there
were
numerous
cases
where
the
courts,
this
court
included
in
the
--
in
the
wily,
and
the
others
as
they
are
out
--
set
out
in
the
mahnich
case
where
the
courts
predicated
liability
on
really
negligence,
although
it
was
the
negligence
of
a
fellow
servant
which
created
an
unsafe
condition.
so
that
although
there
could
not
be
a
recovery
on
the
basis
of
pure
negligence
of
a
fellow
servant.
the
supreme
court
in
many
instances
as
is
outlined
in
the
mahnich
case,
allowed
recovery
where
that
negligence
created
an
unsafe
condition.
the
court
has
held
that
there
would
--
there
need
not
be
any
scienter.
there
was
no
notice.
the
court
has
held
that
it
is
an
absolute
duty.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
need
not
go
so
far
here,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
your
honor's
statement
is
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
much,
much
in
general
of
course
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
but
your
--
when
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
pinar
del
rio.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
he
did
overrule
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
did
overrule
it,
sir.
he
overruled
it
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
he
overruled
specifically
the
pinar
del
rio.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
pinar
del
rio
--
and
here
were
the
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
in
that
case
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
in
that
case,
your
honor
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
my
recollection
is
that
he
specifically
overruled
it.
here
were
the
facts.
in
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
under
the
--
well
under
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
under
the
old
law
--
under
the
old
law,
there
could
be
no
recovery
for
the
negligence
of
a
fellow
servant.
in
the
mahnich
case,
a
mate
and
a
bosun
selected
a
defective
piece
of
rope
from
a
group
of
rope
which
was
an
abundant
supply
of
rope
which
was
entirely
satisfactory
and
they
rigged
the
scaffold
with
it.
and
the
man
went
up
on
the
foredeck
and
started
to
paint
and
down
he
came
because
of
the
defective
rope.
it
was
their
contended
on
the
basis
of
the
pinar
del
rio
case
that
the
ship
could
not
be
responsible
because
actually
it
was
the
negligence
of
the
mate
and
of
the
bosun
which
created
this
condition.
and
therefore,
there
could
be
no
liability.
the
supreme
court
said
no,
that
rope
was
defective.
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
if
it
was
an
abundant
supply
of
good
rope,
if
there
was
an
abundant
supply
of
good
rope,
there
had
to
be
liability
because
it
was
an
unsafe
scaffold
which
had
been
rigged.
and
the
court
there
specifically
overruled
the
pinar
del
rio
which
had
held
expressly
to
the
contrary.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i'm
sure
we
didn't
overrule
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
take
that
to
mean
that
they
--
when
they
disapproved
a
decision
in
pinar
del
rio.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
sir,
i
--
i
don't
know
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
it
was
a
holding
in
the
pinar
del
rio
which
was
disapproved.
however,
in
any
event
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
i
do
want
to
express
my
appreciation
for
the
additional
time
and
the
consideration
which
is
given.
and
i
will
file
my
brief
right
--
my
memory
in
great
copy,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
sir.
