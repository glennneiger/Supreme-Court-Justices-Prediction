justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
the
thrust
of
what
he
said,
perhaps
i'm
wholly
wrong
was
that
if
this
log
or
whatever
it
was
being
hauled
up,
had
not
stuck
in
the
process
of
hauling
it
up
against
the
--
against
the
coaming,
that
that
ring
would
have
carried
that
weight
adequately.
and
that
what
happened
was
that
the
operators
of
this
rig,
instead
of
stopping
the
rig
when
they
found
the
thing
being
hauled
up
and
stuck,
they
proceeded
to
apply
more
power
and
as
a
result,
the
thing
broke.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
mistaken
in
what
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
i
understood
him
to
say?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
will
happen
if
it
has
been
set
at
three?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
have
happened?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean,
as
soon
as
the
strain
started
--
being
applied,
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
care
to
comment
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
113,
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
--
a
proper
--
a
proper
finding
of
negligence
--
negligence
of
the
(inaudible)
according
to
the
supreme
court,
the
sole
active
and
primary
cause
of
the
parting
of
the
gear.
i
think
it
goes
on
to
say
that
(inaudible)
unseaworthiness
but
in
order
to
find
--
to
bring
it
unsearworthy
in
this
case,
if
the
other
side
something
wrong
with
the
gear.
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
setting,
the
cut
off,
at
six
tons
does
not
(inaudible)
the
vessel
unseaworthy
unless
there
was
reason
to
appear
that
it's
strained
in
about
six
ton
here
which
would
activate
the
cut
off
device,
subject
cable
15-ton
capacity
in
the
topping-lift
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
excuse
me.
could
you
point
these
findings
(inaudible)
these
findings
of
judge
wortendyke
which
you
(inaudible)
judge
hastie's?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
--
that's
argued.
is
there
a
finding
of
judge
wortendyke
in
which
you
find
the
strain
of
15
tons?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
he
goes
on
at
page
32
to
say,
(inaudible)
the
primary
cause
of
the
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
find
the
details?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
(inaudible)
was
over
the
square
of
the
hatch,
meaning
on
the
hole?
justice
john
m.
harlan
tomorrow
morning,
could
you
pinpoint
those
two
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
now
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
make
or
understand
that
on
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
what
you're
saying
and
justice
brennan's
question
about
it
makes
no
(inaudible).
if
i
understand
you
now
and
correct
me,
you
say,
the
cut
off
at
six
tons,
current
stop,
is
not
at
the
same
time
cut
off
the
strain
that
has
been
already
created
(inaudible)
whatever
it
is
on
this
boom,
is
that
it?
and
that
it,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
care
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
multiplication.
but
the
point
is,
the
stopping
of
the
--
stopping
of
the
current
does
not
stop
this
--
does
not
cut
off
the
strain
on
the
boom
that's
already
been
created,
whatever.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
is
that
what
this
all
comes
down
to
and
as
to
justice
brennan's
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
say
that
before
this
accident
happened,
they
had
been
hauling
up
logs
for
an
hour.
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
weight
of
the
logs
that
they
were
hauling
at
the
time
of
the
accident
was
greater
than
the
amount
they
have
been
hauling
during
that
previous
hour?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
maximum?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
one
question,
on
page
32
of
the
record
(inaudible)
that
contains
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
approximate
cause
of
the
accident
with
the
negligence
of
the
stevedoring
company.
how
do
you
reconcile
that
finding
with
the
finding
above,
immediately
above,
reliability
of
the
vessel
where
the
district
court
says
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
has
found
that
the
winch
cut
off
device
at
the
time
that
the
winch
was
turned
over
libellants,
fellow
employees
for
operation
rendered
the
respondent
vessel
unseaworthy?
under
those
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
whenever
they
they
stack
together.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
don't
stack,
is
that
what
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
do
with
judge
hastie's
statement
where
he
expressly
says
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
justify
a
finding,
the
setting
was
cut
off
at
six
tons
was
--
rendered
the
ship
unseaworthy.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
characterized
the
statement
correctly,
haven't
i?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
quarrel
with
that
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
did
you
intend
that
we
would
be
justified
in
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
on
this
record
saying
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
setting
of
this
cut
off
at
six
was
unseaworthiness,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
right
to
do
that?
