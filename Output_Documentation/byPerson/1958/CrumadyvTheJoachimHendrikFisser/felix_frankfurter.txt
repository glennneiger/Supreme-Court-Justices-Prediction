will
you
--
and
will
you
for
the
sake
of
a
land
lover,
translate
technical
sea
--
water
terms
into
english.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
know
at
least
that
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
runner
the
black
part?
justice
felix

the
black
part
or
the
whole?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole.
all
right,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
anticipate,
but
help
me
a
little
bit
to
understand.
before
the
operation
of
the
--
of
lifting
the
lumber
begun,
was
the
relation
of
the
boom
to
the
mast,
or
both
booms
to
the
mast
subjective
to
criticism
by
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
if
--
if
it's
relevant.
if
you
tell
me
it's
irrelevant,
i'll
accept
it.
as
--
as
the
gear
was
in
position
before
the
unloading
began,
was
there
any
--
was
unseaworthiness
predicated
as
of
the
position
of
the
gear
at
the
--
before
the
operation
begin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
tell
me
that's
out
of
order
or
--
i'd
accept
your
word
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
foreclose
subsequent
unseaworthiness
through
operation.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
in
the
study
condition,
were
there
any
complaint
by
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
want
to
go
step
by
step.
one
step
are
all
enough
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
none
of
your
concern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
none
of
your
concern,
indemnity,
is
it?
indemnity
problem
is
none
of
your
concern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
did
the
wire
--
rope
break
because
the
boom
was
too
port
ward?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
may
i
break
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
and
this
brings
me
back
to
the
rigging
question.
was
the
rigging
in
which
--
was
the
rigging
in
the
original
position
in
which
the
rigging
was
before
the
boom
was
stretch
over
port
ward?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly,
was
the
--
who
was
in
charged
of
the
winch
and
governor
of
the
winch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
set
at
fix.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
why
wasn't
that
in
and
out
itself
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
it
was
set
at
six,
six
tons,
or
in
effect
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
did
it
have
to
carry
six
or
it
was
set
at
six?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pressure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
test
by
the
ship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
you're
right
about
that
and
please
tell
me
why
that
isn't
conclusive,
why
you
have
to
bother
about
the
other
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
--
if
--
since
that's
traceable
to
the
ship
and
it
should
have
been
set
at
three
rather
than
six,
why
isn't
that
in
and
of
itself
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
factor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
will
you
--
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
judge
hastie
said
--
the
case
is
out
of
my
mind.why
he
said
it
was
irrelevant
that
the
governor
was
set
at
six
when
it
should've
been
set
at
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
it
isn't
for
you
to
say,
for
the
respondent
to
say
what
is
the
point
of
making
three
--
the
norm
if
that
isn't
to
be
respected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
freedman.
when
you
say
that
three
is
safe
and
therefore
six
exceeded
the
safety
limit,
what
is
the
evidence
that
--
on
which
that
statement
is
based
that
three
is
the
standard
of
the
norm
of
safety
rather
than
are
conventional
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
generality.
i
want
--
in
this
record,
is
there
--
what
is
--
was
there
proof
and
findings
based
on
proof
that
three
really
was
the
determination
of
safety
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
would
affect
that
wire
above.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
gear,
two-three
tons?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
just
--
had
been
relying
to
a
three-ton
safety,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
then
a
stipulation?
where
is
that
exactly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
14?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
wasn't
a
record
on
the
ship
as
to
the
weight
of
the
--
to
the
summit
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
freedman,
if
i'm
not
interrupting
you,
you
said
all
the
evidence
is
clear
that
the
strain
on
the
lateral
would
be
what
--
would
--
that
the
wire
would
snap.
now,
judge
hastie
says
there's
nothing
in
this
record
which
suggests
that
such
an
eventuality
was
reasonably
to
be
feared
or
anticipated.
are
you
saying
that
that
is
a
misreading
or
a
failure
to
read
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
care
about
judge
wortendyke's
finding.
i
mean,
i
do
care
but
for
the
moment,
i'm
talking
about
what
the
record,
not
the
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
going
on
to
a
sentence
beyond
which
mr.
justice
harlan
did,
saying
it
would
subject
--
which
would
--
if
only
there
was
reason
for
fear
that
a
strain
of
above
six
tons
on
the
running
gear
which
would
activate
the
cut
off
would
subject
a
cable
of
15-ton
capacity
in
the
topping-lift
to
a
dangerous
strain.
your
argument
is
--
that
it
is
subjective
to
a
dangerous
strain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
judge
hastie
goes
on
to
say
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
and
by
record,
i
mean
testimony.
in
this
record,
i
don't
mean
to
be
disrespectful.
the
lord
knows
about
this,
wouldn't
he?
would
suggest
that
such
an
eventuality
was
reasonably
to
be
feared
or
anticipated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
the
record
--
the
record
doesn't
--
it
contradicts
that
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
--
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
the
sole
evidence
on
that
subject
bears
out
the
statement
you've
just
made.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
referring
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
do
it
later.
it'll
hold
you
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
the
--
the
only
witness,
you
say
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
on
the
function
of
this
so-called
governor
or
cut
off
or
circuit
breaker
has
to
do
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
the
load
of
the
electricity
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
with
limiting
the
load.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
through
a
translator
or
--
was
this
through
a
translator
or
difficult
english?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
little
while
ago
as
justice
brennan
was
referring
to,
you
pulled
a
rope
there
and
showed
how
the
--
how
the
accident,
the
injuries,
the
incident
occurred,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
you
pulled
the
rope,
it
wasn't
a
rope
that
was
pulled
that
brought
about
the
incident,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
bring
it
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
the
question
had
bother
some
of
us
is,
if
there
had
been
cut
off,
why
wouldn't
that
pressure
not
had
been
wanting,
why
would
there
not
have
been
an
absence
of
that
pressure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
could
it
be
--
if
--
if
saying
--
what
you've
just
said
that
that
is
also
a
purpose,
then
what
is
the
bearing
of
that
fact,
if
it
be
a
fact
on
the
conclusion
that
the
sole
--
that
the
sole
causative
factor
of
the
accident
was
what
the
law
--
what
the
stevedore
concerned
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
if
--
if
it
be
so,
if
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
cut
off
or
whatever
it's
called,
one
of
the
consequences
of
it
bears
on
the
load
then
how
can
it
be
said
--
well,
the
district
court
found
it
that
that
--
that
the
negligence
of
the
stevedoring
company
was
the
sole
operating
core
of
the
--
of
the
engine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
it
is
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
say
more
than
that,
that
it
isn't
supposed
to,
that
it
had
no
effect,
that
it
wasn't
an
ingredient
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
in
the
circumstances
of
what
actually
took
place
here,
the
fact
that
the
lumber
got
caught
and
they
couldn't
tow
up.
the
--
the
cut
off
at
six,
whether
it
was
fixed
or
even
more
it
could
be,
would
be
irrelevant.
is
that
what
they're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
further
that
if
they
had
stop
trying
to
lift,
to
get
the
lumber
from
its
--
from
its
snare,
they'd
stopped
trying
to
lift
it,
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
with
what
the
cut
off
was
and
indeed
that
the
--
whatever
the
cut
off
was,
it
had
no
effect
on
the
power
that's
gathered
up
on
the
boom
and
on
the
wire,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
--
do
i
get
from
judge
--
is
judge
hastie's
opinion
really
an
endeavor
to
make
almost
a
mathematical
demonstration
of
that
kind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
suppose
that
is
genetically
demonstrable,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
earlier
that
it
was
irrelevant.
i'll
stick
to
that
word.
that
--
that
the
cut
off,
the
six,
was
irrelevant
to
what
happened
to
the
--
of
course,
to
the
question
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
justice
black
is
asking
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
first
mr.
cichanowicz,
i
don't
mean
to
be
obsessive
on
to
point
but
you
said
a
little
while
ago
they
had
no
business
to
rely
the
cut
off
instead
of
six,
instead
of
three.
the
question
isn't
whether
they
had
any
business
to
rely
if
in
fact
that
entered
into
the
occurrence
and
if
in
fact
have
--
have
served
a
safety
purpose,
then
it
would
be
immaterial
whether
they
relied
on
it
or
not.
you
must
go
to
the
position
which
i
tried
to
express
boringly
several
times
that
it
was
irrelevant
to
the
occurrence
that
the
percentage
takes.
not
that
they
had
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
no
business
to
rely
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
had
--
know
that
it
was
not
a
contributing
factor
or
ingredient,
or
call
it
what
you
will,
that
it
didn't
enter
into
the
result
which
gives
rise
to
the
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
if
it
has
been
fitted,
what
they
wanted
it
to
be
fitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
you
give
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
impression
that
if
it
has
been
set
at
three,
they
couldn't
have
lifted
any
lumber?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
out?
then
we
have
to
consider
ryan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
that
the
--
doesn't
that
--
if
i
may
say
so,
answer
the
problem
sitting
here?
because
after
all
that
was
the
ryan
argument
that
why
should
the
--
there
too,
ryan
was
at
fault
--
i
mean,
the
ship
was
at
fault.
the
whole
question
is,
this
business
of
primary,
subsidiary
main
ship
culpability
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
against
the
person
on
whom
the
burden
rest
to
see
that
the
job
is
done.
and
i
don't
--
you
make
me
--
you
give
me
the
impression
that
you
think
it's
all
one
has
to
do
to
state
your
proposition,
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me
as
clear
as
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
we
have
them
very
widely
accepted
doctrine,
a
third
party
beneficiary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
--
when
would
that
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
asked
is
because
a
lot
of
law
is
coming
through
current,
buick
against
macpherson
and
all
of
that
kind
of
stuff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does
deal
with
who
can
rely
on
a
remote
contractually
unrelated
person's
negligence.
and
either
you
have
a
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
sole,
almost
exclusive
cause
of
this
unfortunate
episode
with
your
client.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
that
is
so,
then
there's
a
(inaudible)
of
the
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mechanics
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
seely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
what
did
you
say,
that
everybody
agreed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
trial
court
found
the
opposite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
did
the
district
court
find?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
experts
testified
about
something
that
wasn't
in
the
case.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
parenthetically,
telling
me
to
what
point,
not
just
plain,
but
to
what
proposition
are
you
expounding
what
you're
about
to
explain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
--
what
position
are
you
--
are
you
taking
in
what
you're
going
to
tell
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
--
are
you
concerned
to
prove
there
was
unseaworthiness
or
there
wasn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
disinterested
to
the
expenditure
of
a
complicated
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
confiscated
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
question
is
whether
this
contract
could
be
something
--
isn't
for
something.
i
think
that
--
i
think
there's
a
question.
i
don't
mean
to
give
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this,
this
very
question,
this
very
question.
has
that
been
adjudicated
in
the
lower
court,
did
it
come
up?
i
don't
mean
in
analogous
cases.
i
don't
mean
argumentative
decisions,
but
in
the
situation
like
this,
are
there
any
lower
court
case
who
have
rendered
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
third
circuit
it
opened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
explicitly
said
that
he
doesn't
have
to
reach
this
theory
as
well?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
monigan,
am
i
wrong
in
having
a
--
i'm
going
to
say
a
vaguish
impression
in
the
past
readings
that
there
are
instances
where
--
where
a
third
party
could
avail
of
an
arrangement,
not
made
directly
to
himself
in
this
maritime
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whether
--
all
that
this
is
--
is
something
--
the
hole
so
deep
in
admiralty
law
that
the
ship
is
the
thing,
that
this
binds
the
ship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you've
said
enough
to
perhaps
even
persuade
you
that
there's
something
for
discussion
in
this
problem
that
it
isn't
to
be
dismissed
(inaudible)
justice

non-concept
that
the
owner
may
not
have
an
eye
to
the
arrangement
made
by
the
charterer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
charter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
and
it
raises
the
whole
question
of
what
is
and
what
isn't
implied
in
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
vessel
chartered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends
on
what
that
means
that
every
--
that
--
it
said
three
--
three-tons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
that
means
and
then
the
equipment
in
view
of
the
coast
guard
saying
on
--
to
say
the
least
not
clear
in
my
mind
what
it
does
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
concept
that
the
germans
may
not
have
the
same
process
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
wholly
irrelevant
question?
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
--
am
i
--
is
there
any
doubt
that
nacirema
is
liable
under
the
longshoreman's
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
mahnich
the
map
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
map
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
the
obsolete
map
that
was
in
the
draw.
and
they
have
a
good
map
but
they
used
an
old
map.
isn't
that
mahnich?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
i
mean.
the
charts,
that's
what
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
have
said
chart.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
--
they
had
the
right
ones
there
but
they
also
had
some
old
ones
and
the
old
ones
were
used
and
that
was
deemed
unseaworthy
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
freedman,
the
most
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
but
the
most
perfect,
the
most
seaworthy
boat
can
be
twisted
out
of
shape
and
out
of
gear
by
some
conduct
of
--
of
negligent
or
misconducting
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
that
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
physical
ship,
the
gear,
the
booms,
all
the
components
that
a
make
ship
what
we
call
seaworthy.
and
every
expert
would
say
and
you
would
say
it
was
seaworthy.
but
it
could
be
twisted
out
of
shape.
it
could
be
contorted,
couldn't
it,
by
some
misconduct
of
those
who
handle
it.
and
therefore,
your
proposition
is
that
whenever
any
non-crew
members
do
these
things
that
negligence
per
se
renders
the
ship
unseaworthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
almost
your
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
any
kind
of
negligence
that
--
that
whenever
through
the
negligence
of
stevedores,
an
otherwise
seaworthy
ship
is
twisted
out
of
shape
or
contorted,
damage
is
done
to
it,
that
makes
the
ship
--
it
then
becomes
unseaworthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
there's
a
lot
of
them,
talk
in
mahnich
but
it
doesn't
stand
for
that
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
chief
justice
stone
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
explaining
away,
not
overruling,
in
explaining
away
--
i
forgot
what's
the
name
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
overruled
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
terms,
it
was
overruled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
overruled
in
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
what
the
case
is
very
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
disapprove
some
language
in
a
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
don't
overrule
the
decision
in
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
i
have
constantly
learned
new
law
but
i
thought
that
that's
still
is
good,
that
by
over
--
by
saying
we
disapprove
a
specific
statement
in
an
opinion,
we
don't
overrule
the
decision.s
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
with
the
holding?
you
keep
on
saying
the
holding.
it
was
language
in
talk.
