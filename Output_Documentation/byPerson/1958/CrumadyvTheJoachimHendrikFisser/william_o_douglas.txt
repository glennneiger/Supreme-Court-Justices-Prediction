justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
his
point
was
that
the
--
the
difference
between
unseaworthy
applied
to
the
rigging,
and
rigging
that
was
seaworthy
but
that
was
misused,
negligently
used.
there
was
nothing
here
that
was
not
unseaworthy.
justice
william
o.
douglas
rigging,
everything
with
a
control
device,
but
the
control
device
wasn't
properly
used.
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
that
his
point?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
irrelevant
in
this
--
as
to
the
matter
of
this
--
whether
it's
(inaudible)
the
question
i'm
putting
on
to
you
is
the
negligent
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
the
question
i
tried
to
get
you
answer
earlier,
with
several
injuries.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
can
you
say
that
when
the
amount
of
the
--
the
size
of
the
load
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
power
that
goes
into
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
amount
of
power.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
amount
of
power.
i
read
the
parts
of
the
record
you
refer
to
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
i
get
something
quite
different
from
them.
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
power,
that
the
--
that
the
amount
of
the
power
being
used
by
the
machines
depends
upon
the
amount
and
the
size
of
the
load.
justice
william
o.
douglas
some
effect,
it
has
a
very
--
i
think
some
effect
is
understating
it.
it
seems
to
me
they
have
--
have
a
very
important
effect.
the
greater
the
load,
the
more
power
you
use
to
lift
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you
get
to
--
you
get
to
your
cut
off
at
a
certain
load
level?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
get
an
excess
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
excessive
load
on
the
--
on
the
system.
justice
william
o.
douglas
one
way
of
getting
the
--
one
way
of
getting
the
excess
load
on
the
system
is
to
put
heavy
weights
on
the
booms.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
the
exclusive
purpose
with
--
i
do
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
it
is
not
one
of
the
purposes
of
it.
