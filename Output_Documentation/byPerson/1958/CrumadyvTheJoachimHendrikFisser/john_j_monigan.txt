mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
in
a
position
that
so
far
as
the
merits
of
the
controversy
in
which
i
find
myself
engaged,
nobody
has
mentioned
it.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
that
is
a
desirable
result
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i'm
out
of
it,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
for
whatever
reason
then
because
we
won't
reach
my
problem
and
that
the
ship
is
exculpated.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
if
--
then
i'm
out
as
well
i
believe.
i
--
i
think
that
if
the
vessel
was
cast
in
liability
for
being
unseaworthy
because
of
this
cut
off
device
then
i'm
out
because
the
vessel
contributed
to
the
mischief.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
our
contract
in
this
case
was
not
with
the
vessel
within
the
terms
of
ryan.
our
contract
was
with
the
charter
of
the
vessel
and
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
--
and
i
don't
know
whether,
your
honors,
want
to
get
into
this
aspect
of
it
currently
or
not
because
the
problem
then
presents
itself
as
to,
can
a
party
to
a
stevedore
contract
--
a
person
not
a
party
to
a
stevedoring
contract
avail
himself
of
the
principles
annunciated
by
this
court
in
ryan.
it
is
our
contention
that
to
do
so
is
lacking
any
support.
particularly,
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
main
argument
even
--
so
long
as
the
vessel
has
done
something
at
fault
even
if
a
person
can
be
the
beneficiary
of
a
contract
to
which
he
is
not
a
party
within
this
framework.
nevertheless,
i'm
quite
confident
that
no
court
would
construe
any
part
of
warranty
under
ryan
to
exculpate
a
person
from
fault
which
he
himself
has
committed.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
then
so
far
as
that
aspect
to
the
matter
is
concerned,
ryan
certainly
does
not
hold
that
a
--
that
a
person,
not
a
party
to
the
stevedoring
contract
can
avail
himself
of
the
principle
of
implied
undertaking.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
is
so,
your
honor.
except
that
this
court
has
determined
that
as
between
a
charterer
of
--
that
a
charterer
is
not
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
a
contract
to
repair
a
vessel
made
between
the
owner
of
the
craft
and
a
ship
repair
company,
so
to
make
it
possible
for
a
--
time
charterer
who
was
deprived
of
the
profits
of
his
charter
by
reason
of
the
improper
conduct
of
the
ship
repair
organization
as
a
consequence
of
which
the
propeller
was
damaged
and
the
vessel
was
out
of
commission,
so
that
the
time
charterer
could
not
make
his
profits.so,
this
court
stated
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
mr.
--
mr.
justice
holmes
decided
that
case.
it's
referred
to
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
well,
of
course
if
i
may
suggest
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
--
our
problem
of
macpherson
lies
in
negligence.
the
problem
in
macpherson,
the
theory
of
recovery
in
macpherson
was
not
upon
a
third
party
beneficiary
but
upon
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
--
primary
negligence.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
the
finding
of
the
district
court
was
that
the
craft
was
unseaworthy
because
of
this
winch
cut
off
which
was
supported
by
testimony
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
--
and
other
which
mcallister
was
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
now,
so
far
however
as
the
situation
on
indemnity
which
is
presented
in
the
matter,
the
principles
of
equating
act
has
been
passed
as
negligence
and
in
this
circumstance
doesn't
apply.
now,
the
counsel
to
the
vessel
has
suggested
that
this
matter
was
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
longshoreman.
now,
the
whole
principle
which
is
--
somewhat,
i'm
concerned
to
some
degree
in
this
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
the
accident
was
caused
by
any
mischief
of
the
longshoreman
regardless
--
of
course,
if
this
court
is
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
craft
was
not
unseaworthy
for
whatever
reason,
then
i
don't
have
to
concern
myself
about
why,
so
long
as
it
is
considered
that
it
is
not
unseaworthy.
however,
if
it
is
determined
to
be
unseaworthy
then
we
have
to
determine
upon
what
theory
is
this
vessel
unseaworthy.
now,
there
was
a
considerable
mention
yesterday
and
this
morning
about
these
parallelograms
of
forces
in
the
vertical
and
component
effects.
now,
we,
this
morning
from
the
congressional
library
got
a
couple
of
books
on
rigging
which
i
don't
know
--
i
--
these
are
not
cited
in
my
brief,
but
possibly
they
will
explain
this
for
persons
who
are
not
a
physicist,
and
i'm
not,
as
to
how
this
comes
about.
one
is
called
handbook
of
rigging
by
rossnagel,
r-o-s-s-n-a-g-e-l
at
pages
57
and
58.
it
has
a
library
of
congress
number
tj1350r58.a
nd
the
other
one
is
mechanics
for
engineers,
seely
and
ensign,
e-n-s-i-g-h
which
bears
library
of
congress
number
qa809.54,
1952.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
mechanics
for
engineers.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
seely,
s-e-e-l-y,
and
ensign,
e-n-s-i-g-n.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
--
if
we
can.
now,
counsel
--
this
case
is
taken
a
--
it's
a
steam
--
a
motor
ship
and
it's
not
a
sailing
craft,
but
--
and
i
was
about
to
say
however
that
this
case
has
taken
very
many
texts
during
the
course
of
its
procedure
through
the
courts.
when
the
unseaworthiness
theory
which
was
first
asserted
below
was
that
there
were
certain
pieces
of
wire
introduced
in
evidence
called
l13
that
comprised
this
gadget
called
the
topping-lift
which
is
the
portside
of
the
craft.
everybody
agreed
that
if
this
--
that
is
when
i
say
everybody,
all
the
experts
and
everybody
agreed
that
these
horrible
l10
and
l13
exhibits,
if
they
were
part
of
the
topping-lift
clearly
made
the
craft
unseaworthy
and
that
would
let
--
that
would
resolve
the
cause
of
the
accident.
however,
that
was
not
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
we're
not
concerned
about
facts
here.
the
trial
court
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no.
everybody
agreed
that
the
wire
that
was
introduced
as
to
this
exhibits
was
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
--
incorrect
wire.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
and
if
it
were
on
the
topping-lift
then
at
the
time
it
would've
--
by
its
own
defects
without
considering
anything
else
about
winch,
cut
offs,
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
found,
however,
that
these
pieces
of
wire
did
not
in
fact
comprise
the
topping-lift.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
and
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
as
to
that.
so,
that's
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
as
to
whether
these
pieces
of
wire
were
on
it.
we
rather
thought
that
we
had
the
edge
factually
on
that
but
the
trier
of
fact
resolved
that
against
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
what
i'm
about
to
say
is
that
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no,
all
that
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
my
degree
of
interest
depends
upon
the
resolution
of
the
basic
question,
except
that
i
am
to
some
extent
impartial,
not
i
hope
to
the
extent
that
my
impartiality
shall
cause
the
liability
to
be
visited
by
my
client.[laughter]
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
now
that
leads
us
to
where
we
were
going
before,
to
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
didn't
reach
the
legal
propositions
for
which
i
believe
there
is
sufficient
authority
to
justify
my
exculpation
from
liability.
now,
so
far
however
as
the
unseaworthiness
aspect
of
this
craft
is
concerned,
the
forces
which
are
assessed
and
i
believe
in
the
question
to
counsel,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
you
suggest
that
that
the
rotation
of
this
pole
has
an
effect
upon
this
matter
and
it
does.
and
the
position
also
of
these
matters
here
was
for
the
guy
--
preventer
also
have
a
factor.
now,
the
reasons
that
this
matter
becomes
important
is
that
the
theory
of
--
on
theory
of
act
of
negligence
which
the
trial
court
suggested
in
the
matter
was
predicated
upon
the
assumption
that
the
location
of
these
two
guy
and
preventer
was
established
without
factual
contradiction
in
order
to
have
this
astronomical
strain
which
was
in
the
vicinity
of
the
19
--
17
to
19
tons.
not
alone
does
one
have
to
assume
a
contingent
pulling,
but
he
also
has
to
assume
certain
locations
as
to
these
ropes.
now,
there
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
longshoreman
testified
that
rather
than
be
in
the
position
which
was
shown
here
and
which
was
testified
too,
by
the
vessel,
these
matters
were
--
those
--
that
being
their
position.
our
witnesses
testified
that
in
fact
they
were
in
a
position
opposite
the
block
at
the
base
of
the
mast,
so
to
create
this
position.
now,
as
a
consequence
of
that,
all
of
the
parallelograms
of
forces
and
factors
and
he
adds
up
--
effect
upon
alters
considerably.
so
that
in
this
position
and
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
as
to
that
which
conflict
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
the
trial
court
found
as
a
fact
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
it
appeared
without
contradiction
that
the
position
of
this
was
and
originally
demonstrated.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
short
conflict
assessment.
so,
if
unseaworthiness
in
the
present
case
is
to
be
predicated
upon
this
protection
for
a
location
of
the
preventer
then
our
interest
in
the
matter
is
solely
to
determine
whether
that
factual
controversy
should
not
be
resolved
because
counsel
for
the
vessel
today
has
suggested
that
the
continued
hold
is
the
factor
after
the
wire
became
or
the
logs
became
jammed
if
they
did
become
jammed.
there
is
a
finding
of
jamming
by
the
trial
court,
but
the
effect
of
the
jamming
is
projected
by
the
trial
court
upon
the
combination
of
that
assumed
location
of
the
preventer
as
being
without
contradiction.
now,
it
is
our
submission
that
the
movement
of
that
in
order
--
and
all
this
testimony
at
the
trial
court
as
to
which
was
referred
to
upon
the
several
hypotheses
was
projected
upon
the
theory
that
two
things,
and
this
the
trial
court
found
that
the
winch
was
bad.
the
combination
of
the
winch
and
the
gear
caused
the
craft
to
be
unseaworthy,
but
that
was
triggered
by
this
movement
of
the
guy
and
preventer.
but
that
movement
of
the
guy
and
preventer
can
have
no
effect
upon
the
stresses
which
are
imposed
unless
the
position
is
such
that
mathematically
on
this
parallelogram
of
forces
that
there
would
be
those
assumed
locations.
now,
the
--
as
a
consequence
then
that
this
court
should
be
inclined
to
consider
that
the
unseaworthy,
that
the
craft
was
unseaworthy
because
of
some
action
of
the
longshoreman
in
moving
gear.
then
we
submit
that
that
movement
cannot
be
predicated
upon
the
trial
court's
opinion
because
the
trial
court
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
longshoreman
testified
the
one
position
for
the
gear
and
the
vessel
officer
testified
to
another.
so,
it
was
not
without
contradiction.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
if
the
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
all
right.
all
right,
as
far
as
my
personal
position
is
concerned,
if
it
were
resolved
that
the
vessel
was
not
unseaworthy,
then
i
shouldn't
have
to
worry
about
anything
else.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
now
--
now,
assuming
that
the
vessel
is
unseaworthy
because
of
something
the
vessel
itself
has
done,
then
i
submit
that
the
--
it's
--
it
then
leads
us
into
the
possibility
that
we
are
again
exculpated,
although
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggest
the
question
is
not
that
easy,
but
--
so
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
the
district
court
did.
the
district
court's
opinion
in
that
respect,
i
regard
as
being
incorrect
and
it
certainly
is
incorrect
upon
the
theory
that
it
was
asserted.
now,
the
indemnity
argument
has
to
be
based
upon
contract
either
expressed
or
implied.
an
expressed
contract
does
not
exist
here
because
our
contract
was
with
the
charter
of
the
vessel
and
not
with
the
vessel
itself.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
at
the
time,
it's
a
time
charter
and
the
vessel's
crew
--
officers
and
crew
were
aboard.
now,
there's
no
--
because
of
the
immunity
under
section
5
of
the
longshoreman's
act
as
--
was
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
ryan
--
in
ryan
and
the
rest
of
them,
that
unless
we
have
voluntarily
done
something
by
way
of
a
contract
to
enlarge
our
section
5
or
to
destroy
our
section
5
longshoreman
immunity,
we
are
immune.
now,
--
so,
we
don't
have
a
question
of
equating
negligence
between
act
to
confess
if
negligence
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no,
i
understand.
the
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
in
the
--
in
the
lower
court?
directly,
no.
there
was
one
that
was
decided
in
the
district
court
of
maryland
that
it's
not
--
it's
dicta
really,
but
the
dicta
is
bearable.
it
says
that
--
and
also
in
the
ninth
circuit,
although
we
have
the
third
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
pretty
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
reached
it
in
their
earlier
decisions,
not
in
this
particular
case.
but
the
--
this
whole
manner
of
--
of
the
--
well,
i
say
this
is
as
far
as
the
beneficiary
of
the
undertaking
is
concerned,
the
third
circuit
in
the
case
that
is
cited
on
page
20
of
our
brief.
well,
it's
not
an
identical
situation.
it's
quite
similar
and
which
they
was
held
that
the
charterer
or
a
vessel
--
of
a
vessel
was
not
the
beneficiary
of
a
stevedoring
contract
made
between
a
stevedoring
company
and
avoids
charterer,
so
to
permit
the
time
charterer
to
sue
the
stevedoring
company
for
damages
sustained
by
reason
of
the
failure
to
discharge
a
cargo
when
there
was
a
work
stoppage.
but
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
they
suggest
in
that
obscurity
of
action
as
a
ground
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
--
as
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
well,
that
it's
true
if
--
if
there
were
a
situation
where
a
lien
was
asserted
against
the
ship,
of
course
there
was
--
this
action
was
initially
started
by
a
ammunition
and
ram
but
a
stipulation
for
value
was
filed
so
that
there
is
no
lien
problem
here.
so,
as
between
--
on
general
principles,
for
example,
i
submit
that
the
general
admiralty
law
in
respect
of
liens
is
not
applicable
to
help
us
to
resolve
the
question.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
the
reason
i
--
the
reason
i
suggested
originally
that
there
was
not
a
situation
of
a
third
party
beneficiary.
there
--
as
far
as
an
intended
beneficiary
is
concerned,
there
is
no
question
at
all
that
ordinary
mercantile
considerations
of
profit
caused
charterers
to
charter
vessels
and
owners
to
hire
them
to
charterers.
the
time
chart
--
now,
this
is
not
a
bareboat
charter
and
the
time
charterer,
when
he
enters
into
a
contract
to
cause
his
hired
vessel
to
be
unloaded
is
not
concerned
about
benefiting
the
owner
of
that
vessel
by
reason
of
that
contract.
what
he
wants
to
do
is
get
the
cargo
discharged
and
get
the
ship
on
her
way.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that's
so
and
that
he
could
put
in
his
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
he
could
put
in
his
charter
partner
if
he
so
desired
and
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
there
--
as
far
as
an
implied
contract
is
concerned
there
certainly
isn't
any
illegal
obligation
employed
--
visited
upon
charterer
which
he
is
advised
to
discharge
in
anyway
which
would
so
far
as
his
cargo
discharged
is
concerned.
as
far
as
the
negligence
is
concerned,
he
doesn't
owe
any
--
duty
in
negligence
to
his
employees,
so
there's
no
basis
for
an
employment
agreement.
and
so
far
as
security
of
action
is
concerned
that
will
arise
only
if
the
charterer
is
liable
to
the
owner,
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
possible
way
for
us
to
resolve
that
question
because
the
ship
was
a
german
vessel.
the
charterer
was
a
south
american
company.
the
charter
party
is
not
before
the
court.
we
don't
know
even
by
what
law
is
to
be
determined
of
obligations
under
the
charter
party.
so,
as
far
as
security
of
action
is
concerned
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no,
sir
and
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i
would.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
it
depends
upon
whether
the
ground
which
the
--
the
affirmance
or
rather
the
reversal
might
take.
if
the
court
is
inclined
to
predicate
unseaworthiness
upon
a
presumed
movement
of
these
two
pieces
of
rope
that's
tied
in
the
preventer,
i
think
that
would
be
incorrect
to
resolve
that
question
without
a
remand,
so
we
can
find
out
where
they
are.
and
--
and
in
the
--
an
appraisal
of
the
conflict
in
the
testimony
in
that
respect
which
we
never
had.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
my
position
in
the
trial
court
was
as
i
indicated
earlier
was
that
we
believe
that
this
wire,
l13,
was
the
one.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
but
that
we
--
that
we
lost
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
we
lost
on
in
the
trial.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no,
it
would
be
--
i
can't
do
that.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
the
only
other
position
is
that
if
the
craft
is
unseaworthy
because
of
this
cut
off
device
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
i
did.
in
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
our
position
is
--
as
outlined
in
--
pages
22
to
25
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
if
the
vessel
did
anything
with
this
cut
off
device,
if
that
cut
off
device
contributed
to
this
accident,
so
that
it
was
a
causative
factor
in
producing
the
result
that
it
achieved,
then
even
if
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
party
to
--
even
if
it's
not
--
even
if
the
fact
that
our
contract
was
with
the
charterer
and
not
with
the
vessel,
it
is
not
a
bar
to
recovery
on
the
implied
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
oh.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
oh.
i
think
that
the
cut
off
cannot
be
ignored,
that
it
did
have
something
to
do
with
it.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
it
had
something
to
do
with
it
because
there's
a
theory
which
is
projected
by
the
vessel
here
that
the
reason
the
whole
affair
happened
was
because
there
was
a
constant
hold
by
the
longshoreman
on
the
cargo
runner
because
it
was
jammed.
that
that
could
not
have
continued
to
operate
if
the
cut
off
device
had
ceased
at
three
ton
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
--
which
was
then
the
duty
of
the
gear.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
the
right
to
reliance,
there
is
nothing
on
and
whether
--
and
i
submit
that
whether
we
are
or
whether
we
should
or
should
not
have
relied
is
not
material
on
trying
to
determine
what
caused
the
accident.
that
leads
us
to
the
question
of
liability.
i
said
in
reflect
to
your
honor's
question
that
i
thought
the
three-ton
cut
off
device
was
a
factor
in
producing
the
accident.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
--
the
testimony
of
the
experts
that
--
of
the
witness
byrne
at
86
and
87
says
that
the
effect
of
this
combination
of
the
cut
off
device
is
drastic
upon
the
safety
factor.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
86
about
halfway,
just
before
the
cross
examine
notation.
the
--
well,
it
starts
actually
at
the
top
of
the
page
of
86
and
continues
over
to
87.and
he
further
says
at
60
--
67,
the
witness,
simons
testified
that
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
then
the
top
of
67,
the
witness
simons
said
that
it
was
not
safe
practice
to
have
a
rig
designed
for
three-ton
and
a
winch
with
a
cut
off
at
six.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
simons
was
witness
that
we
called.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
he
was,
yes.
he
was
a
marine
architect
and
designed
topping
rings
--
rigs
and
so
forth.
but
we
--
we
had
two
--
we
had
two
experts,
simons
and
byrne.
those
were
the
two
references
that
i
invited
to
your
honor's
attention
too.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
it
did
to
this
extent.
as
we
referred
before
to
31
and
32
or
rather
32.
the
court
concluded
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts,
it
has
found
that
the
setting
of
the
winch
cut
off
device
rendered
the
vessel
unseaworthy.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
--
that's
true,
except
that
there
isn't
anything
in
the
--
in
the
testimony
that
says
this.
but
there's
no
question
at
all
from
--
from
physical
factors
that
if
the
cause
of
this
accident
was
pulling
the
gear
apart
as
counsel
showed
that
the
gear
couldn't
have
been
pulled
apart
if
the
--
there
had
been
exerted
upon
the
gear
no
more
than
three
--
no
more
than
something
plus
three
tons
of
strain.
now,
whether
or
not
it's
designed
for
that
purpose
or
not,
it
is
the
fact
that
this
machinery
which
they
had
on
the
ship
and
about
which
we
knew
nothing
was
capable
of
putting
whether
it
was
putting
on
this
additional
load
which
even
if
the
timber
was
jammed
could
not
have
been
done
if
the
--
if
the
energy
transmitted
to
the
cargo
runner
by
this
electric
winch
could
not
have
generated
sufficient
energy
to
increase
it
over
the
safe
working
load
of
the
gear.
and
for
that
reason,
the
integration,
all
of
these
things
are
integrated
into
one
working
machine
and
when
one
puts
into
that
one
working
machine
a
device
which
creates
energy
greater
than
the
rig
can
stand,
that
is
a
cause
of
the
factor
which
--
without
which
the
accident
would
not
have
happened.
and
as
a
consequence
of
which,
the
indemnity
claim
can
--
if
we
get
that
far,
would
be
necessary
to
construe
a
contract
which
did
not
exist
between
the
parties
as
indemnifying
the
vessel
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
--
against
its
own
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes,
against
its
own
ruling,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i
--
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
except
this
that
we
--
that
every
piece
of
the
equipment
that's
there
has
on
a
three-ton
capacity.
we
have
--
i
assume
the
right
to
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
integration
of
machinery
together
would
be
such
that
it
too
would
not
be
capable
of
generating
more
power
than
the
gear
safely
could
bear.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
it
--
it
means
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
the
coast
guard
thing,
i
think
that
--
that
there
are
two
factors
which
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
two
facts
and
i
think
it's
quite
true.
there
is
the
factor
of
two
and
a
half
times
power
which
this
--
mentioned
in
the
coast
guard
regulation
which
quite
obviously
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair,
i
think,
i
submit.
because
in
the
first
place
the
vessel
was
built
in
bremerhaven
and
it
was
not
connected
with
the
coast
guard
affair
on
--
on
that.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
they
might
--
they
might
very
well.
but
in
any
event,
there
are
the
suggestions
that
that
is
put
in
to
safe
the
--
the
motor
from
burning
out.
but
it
also
has
the
effect
of
transmitting
enough
energy
to
pull
the
six-ton
and
it
is
--
it
is
that
creation
of
the
energy
sufficient
to
pull
the
six
with
gear
that
only
could
stay
in
three
which
is
the
predicate
for
the
contributing
aspect
of
--
to
the
accident
and
--
and
the
consonant
with
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
there
were
these
references
which
i
--
i
gave
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
--
to
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
not
--
not
actively
except
that
--
i
think
what
we're
doing
is
we're
getting
into
a
question
of
what
is
--
there
is
nothing
that
expressly
says
that
but
i
think
possibly
if
we
say
that's
a
drastic
combination,
it's
not
safe
practice
and
so
forth,
we
must
predicate
the
thought
that
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
those
witnesses
who
testified
to
that
that
they
believe
that
it
did
have
a
contributing
factor
and
into
that
it
is
the
inference
from
that
testimony
which
perhaps
judge
hastie
didn't
think.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
there
is
testimony
which
would
justify
the
view
that
the
trial
court's
finding
was
supported
by
testimony,
so
to
--
to
cause
the
reviewing
revealing
court
under
mcallister
to
affirm,
to
be
obliged
to
affirm.
but
there
again,
that
perhaps
is
saying
that
it
--
that
true
this
condition
existed
but
it
wasn't
triggered
by
--
by
that
combination.
now,
in
order
to
determine
what
triggers
it,
we
have
to
determine
exactly
the
circumstances
of
the
gear
and
so
forth
which
i
think
has
not
been
reviewed
by
the
--
or
has
not
been
resolved
and
proved.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
the
vessel's
people
said
that
--
that
drawing
the
lines
of
the
argument
that
it
wasn't
designed
to
having
to
deal
with
the
cut
off.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
i
don't
recall
it,
your
honor.
it
--
it's
quite
possible
that
the
ship's
officers
had
said
that
they
did
not
regard
it
as
unsafe.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that
was
the
position
that
--
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
but
not
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no,
they
were
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
they
were
invitational
but
it
is
conceited
that
this
exhibit
does
not
correctly
represent
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes,
well
--
well,
there's
what
they
called
a
clincher
stiffeners
on
the
rail
which
--
no
--
which
no
more
invites
a
particular
spotting
in
this
area
than
anyone
else
except
that
it
does
it
for
the
matter.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes,
where
--
where
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
its
not
--
it's
not
particularly
more
one
way
or
another.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no.
actually,
it
wouldn't
make
--
the
position
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
so
far
as
the
three
or
six
ton
is
concerned.
if
it
were
put
in
the
optimum
position,
which
is
--
where
our
longshoreman
said
it
was
that
would
--
would
of
course
result
in
a
transmittal
of
less
force
if
it
were
three
than
six.
but,
it
will
still
be
for
a
minimum.
now,
actually
this
other
position
is
the
worst
position
you
could
assume
and
which
no
sensible
longshoreman
including
the
witnesses
who
testified
on
our
behalf,
said
that
that
was
a
completely
unrealistic
picture
which
was
assumed
by
the
trial
court
to
have
existed
without
contradiction.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no,
assumed
to
be
established
without
contradiction.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
he
made
--
he
made
the
finding
that
it
appeared
without
contradiction.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
--
i
think
it
would
be
manifestly
erroneous
which
would
cause
an
appellate
court
correctly
to
--
to
direct
that
--
that
controversy
which
is
apparent
in
the
record
and
which
is
apparent
from
the
printed
portions
of
the
record
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
on
this
--
this
point
which
is
concerned
with
the
testimony
of
mr.
costa
which
begins
at
page
52
and
goes
through
to
57.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
--
i
think
that's
--
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
on
that
--
that
aspect
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
monigan,
jr.
no
question
(inaudible).
