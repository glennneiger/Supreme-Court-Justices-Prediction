mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
freedman,
we've
asked
you
so
many
questions.
i'm
sure
you
haven't
had
the
chance
to
sum
up
but
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
although
your
time
is
up.
you
may
take
it
now
or
to
take
it
in
rebuttal
just
as
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
may
and
--
and
other
counsel
may
have
five
minutes
in
addition
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cichanowicz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
is
that
the
reason
that
that
cut
off
should
have
come
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
much
power
was
applied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
you
come
to
that
later.
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wasn't
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
safety
factory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
cichanowicz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
61
and
62,
john
c.
crumady
versus
joachim
hendrik
fisser,
et
al.
mr.
cichanowicz,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
one
more
question
about
--
about
this
as
i
understand
you,
the
--
this
circuit
breaker
is
not
a
safety
factor
so
far
with
the
handling
of
these
booms
are
concerned
through
the
--
through
these
rotors
and
cables,
bearing
in
mind
the
strength
that
they
--
they
checked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
let
me
ask
you
this,
you
--
and
you
therefore
--
you
say
that
the
fact
that
it
is
fixed
at
six
tons
cannot
be
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
was
16
instead
of
six,
would
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
if
it
was
set
at
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
16
instead
of
six.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
then
wouldn't
you
have
to
say
that
if
--
that
there
was
a
safety
factor
involved
in
at
some
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
would
the
--
when
would
that
safety
factor
come
into
play?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
then
as
i
understand
you,
if
--
if
they
set
the
cut
off
above
75
--
seven
and
a
half
tons
here,
there
would
be
a
safety
factor
involved
and
to
have
done
so
would
constitute
negligence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
--
that's
the
dividing
line.
according
to
your
theory
this
would
be
seven
and
a
half
tons?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
of
the
tensile
--
because
of
the
three-ton
load
limit
on
the
cables.
chief
justice
earl
warren
working
load
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
--
i
recall
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monigan,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
your
position
that
the
ship
was
unseaworthy
or
was
not
unseaworthy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
care
so
far
as
your
--
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
freedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
it
and
counsel
may
answer
it,
provided
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
it
promptly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
freedman,
i'm
afraid
we'll
have
to
conclude
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
