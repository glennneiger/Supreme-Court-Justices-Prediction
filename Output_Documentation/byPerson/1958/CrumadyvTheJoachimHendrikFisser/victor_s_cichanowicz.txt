mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
if
it
please
the
court.
so
much
has
been
said
about
the
cut-off
and
about
the
shipping
of
the
topping-lift
that
sort
of
beclouds
the
issues
as
to
actually
why
this
topping-lift
broke.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
initially
when
the
vessel,
when
the
longshoreman
came
on
board,
this
boom
was
over
the
square
of
the
hatch
and
for
a
period
of
one
hour
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i'm
sorry.
this
boom
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
over
the
hole.
that's
right.
now
for
a
period
of
one
hour
the
longshoreman
discharged
timbers
with
no
problem
whatsoever.
they
were
taking
lumber
there
was
in
this
square
of
the
hatch.
now,
shortly
before
this
accident
occurred,
the
longshoreman
then
switch
this
boom
which
was
positioned
in
this
way
over
to
the
position
that
it's
indicated
on
this
model
now.
evidently,
the
purpose
was
to
getting
more
lateral
poles
so
that
they
could
remove
timbers
that
were
underneath
this
part
of
the
deck
port
ward
in
the
wings
of
the
vessel.
and
the
first
timbers
that
they
sought
to
remove
were
the
timbers
that
were
involved
in
the
accident.
one
timber
was
in
the
square
of
the
hatch.
the
other
timber
was
underneath.
the
longshoreman
took
a
sling
which
is
a
piece
of
wire
with
an
eye
at
each
end.
and
before
they
did
that,
they
lifted
the
timbers
up
with
a
crowbar
and
inserted
the
sling
around
it,
and
then
attached
the
sling
to
this
hook
that
is
on
the
runners
here.
and
then
they
started
to
pull
and
they
kept
on
pulling,
and
actually
what
happened
is
--
i
can
demonstrate
here.
they
kept
on
doing
that.
in
other
words,
they
were
trying
to
pull
the
ship
apart.
when
they
did
that,
as
they
did
that,
something
broke,
something
had
to
break.
in
this
case,
the
topping-lift
broke.
this
would
cause
the
accident.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
shifting
of
the
boom.
it's
true
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
both
have
referred
to
the
shifting
of
the
boom.
they've
also
referred
--
the
district
court
has
referred
to
the
cut
off,
that
i
will
deal
with
later.
but
this
accident
never
would
have
happened
if
the
longshoreman
have
not,
as
the
district
court
found,
it
said
the
proximate
cause
or
the
sole
act
and
primary
cause
of
this
accident
was
the
continued
application
of
power
to
the
winch
by
the
longshoreman
after
the
timber
had
become,
in
fact,
or
after
the
movement
of
the
timber
had
become
effectively
blocked.
that
is
what
caused
this
accident.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right
your
honor.
i
say
that
it
would
have
made
no
difference
whether
the
boom
was
shifted
or
not
shifted.
when
you
continue
applying
power,
something
has
got
to
give.
in
this
case,
the
topping-lift
broke.
the
runner
might
have
broken.
nobody
can
tell
what
may
have
happened.
now,
insofar
as
the
cut
off
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
your
honor.
may
i
--
now,
i'd
like
you
to
refer
to
the
cut
off.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
the
reference
to
the
cut
off.
counsel
has
been
talking
about
this
device
as
a
governor.
it
is
not
a
governor.
this
device
is
put
into
the
--
as
they
call
it
mast
blocker
which
is
away
from
all
of
the
equipment.
the
--
the
equipment,
the
winches
are
forward
here.
and
that
is
a
device
which
is
on
the
cables
or
wires
furnishing
the
current
to
the
electric
motors.
and
the
sole
purpose
of
that
and
this
is
the
only
testimony
in
the
case
on
what
the
purpose
of
that
was
and
that
was
to
prevent
an
overload
of
current
so
that
the
motors
would
not
burn
out.
that
is
the
sole
purpose.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
now
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
regulating
the
load.
counsel
talks
about
it.
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
it
that
this
is
what
i
would
say
a
load
limiting
device.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
limiting
the
load.
the
longshoreman
didn't
even
know
that
it
was
there.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
is
right.
there
was
one
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
there
was
one
witness,
(inaudible)
here
who
talks
about
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
he
was
--
he
was
an
expert
on
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
is
right.
this
expert
on
the
chief
maid
also
testifies
because
we
had
some
problem.
these
were
german
witnesses.
and
in
fact,
that
is
the
reason
why
the
captain's
testimony
may
prove
a
little
fuzzy
and
not
clear.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it
was
through
a
translator
but
i
understand
it
was
considerable
difficulty
because
of
the
dialects
that
were
spoken.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i
will,
sir.
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
once
it
--
once
the
--
once
it
--
this
cuts
the
current
off
then
it's
necessary
to
go
back
into
the
mast
house
and
all
you
do
is
--
there
is
a
button
there
that
you
push
which
restores
the
current.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
apparently
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
the
electric
power
would
go
out
when
the
load
current
reaches
--
i
mean,
the
difficulty
is
--
as
i
think
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
was
that
we
were
trying
to
relay
the
electrical
to
mechanical
problems.
in
other
words,
the
load
--
full
load
current
was
equivalent
to
about
a
little
better
six-ton.
now,
i
will
explain
why
it
was
six-ton.
aside
from
this
coast
guard
regulation
regarding
which
two
of
the
witnesses
testified.
most
--
a
witness
simon
who
was
produced
by
the
impleaded
respondent
testified
that
there
was
a
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
the
question
is
--
and
may
i
say
this.
the
court
said
it
was
17
to
21.
i
say
that
it
probably
was
even
more
than
that
because
what
happened
is
this.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
oh,
no,
it
isn't.
its
laid
--
it's
laid
off
here
and
only
controls
the
current
to
the
motor
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
and
the
power
from
the
motor
which
tends
to
transfer
it
to
the
winch
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
so
that
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
not
necessarily.
maybe
i
can
demonstrate
what
i
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i'm
going
to
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
let
me
say
this
that
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it
was
the
runner
which
was
on
the
winch
that
was
being
powered
by
the
electric
motors.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
there
the
cut
off
--
the
reason
is
that
the
cut
off
was
set
to
take
here
of
inertia
and
other
things.
that's
why
it
was
set
up
here.
but
--
i
can
--
the
reason
that
you
had
all
this
power
built
up,
maybe
this
will
answer
the
question
is
this.
if
all
that
we
were
doing
was
lifting
up
a
three-ton
load,
we
would
have
to
exert
three
tons
plus
pressure
to
raise
this.
now,
what
happens
is
when
this
is
caught,
this
is
what
happens,
you're
exerting
and
this
is
in
the
calculation.
these
are
the
mathematical
calculations
that
judge
hastie
speaks
about.
when
you
start
pulling
on
this,
you
had
three
tons
but
this
is
also
--
this
is
not
moving.
this
is
what's
building
all
this
--
actually,
the
computations
are
they
just
put
three
tons
here
and
three
tons
here,
three
tons
being
caught
here.
you've
got
something
like
five
and
a
half
tons
of
full
right
here
in
the
head
of
the
boom.
that's
why
when
you
start
talking
about
the
cut
off,
this
whole
thing
is
throwing
out
completely
when
you've
got
a
load
caught
in
here
because
you
no
longer
lifting
a
three-ton
load.
you're
not
lifting
a
six-ton
load.
you've
got
a
tremendous
amount
of
power
built
up
right
in
here
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
and
that
what
caused
this
to
break.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
actually
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
actually
your
honor,
i
--
the
computation
was
--
i'm
sorry.
the
difference
in
the
computation
was
that
this
was
just
three
tons
in
here.
that's
exactly
why,
we
just
demonstrated
it.
in
other
words,
three
and
three,
this
is
sought.
it
wasn't
six
tons.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right
except
--
may
i
--
the
positioning
of
this
though,
there's
got
to
be
a
condition
where
this
is
going
to
--
where
it
will
break
because
you're
lifting
along
through
the
portside.
that
changes
the
components
of
forces
that
you
get
when
you
have
a
strain
in
operation.
i
agree.
that's
--
in
other
words,
the
forces
that
are
exerted
on
this
topping-lift
with
the
boom
shifted
in
that
position,
pulling
in
this
way
was
greater
than
if
--
than
they
are
when
the
boom
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
is
directly
over
the
hatch.
it
doesn't
change
but
still,
it's
not
an
unseaworthy
condition
because
this
is
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
this
is
what
causes
the
all
of
the
strain.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
exactly.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
it
cut
off
around
--
it
cut
off
around
there
but
you
see,
the
forces
then
began
to
multiply
in
here.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
in
other
words
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i
believe
so.
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
hazy
on
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
at
--
at
the
time
of
the
--
at
the
--
if
--
when
the
cut
off
went
off,
it
means
that
a
certain
amount
of
pressure
was
built
up
at
that
time.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
yes,
because
it's
caught
underneath.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
it
would
not
have.
may
i
say
this
--
that
we
have
here
two
methods
by
which
this
could
have
been
shut
off.
in
fact,
those
are
the
methods
by
which
it
should
have
been
set
off.
there
was
lever.
the
longshoreman
was
operating
this
with
a
lever.
he
pushed
it
--
i
believe
forward
from
himself
it
would
raise,
if
he
put
it
in
the
middle,
it's
neutral,
if
he
pulls
it
back,
it
would
lower.
he
had
that.
he
also
had
a
switch.
it
was
shown
to
him
when
he
started
working.
here's
a
switch
that
you
can
turn
off
this
operation.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
the
winch
operator
himself.
in
other
words,
in
this
situation,
here's
a
man
standing
down
and
he
keeps
on
operating
this
winch
and
continuing
to
apply
the
pressure.
and
now
--
which
the
trial
court
and
the
parties
coming
here
and
say,
“but
the
cut
off
should've
cut
off.
this
is
the
man
who
should
have
turned
this
thing
off.
he
had
them
where
with
all
which
to
do
it.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right,
it
wouldn't
have
broken.
but
the
fact
is
this,
your
honor,
that
there's
testimony
in
this
case
which
is
uncontradicted
that
--
by
two
experts
that
the
setting
of
a
cut
off
such
as
this
is
proper
at
250%
of
the
--
a
full
load
current.
in
other
words,
250%
of
three
tons
which
was
the
safe
working
load
of
this
equipment.
i
might
point
out
that
on
each
of
these
booms,
it
was
marked
three
tons,
which
means
that
you
can.
this
it's
international
practice.
you
can't
lift
more
than
three
tons.
that's
what
guides
this
longshoreman
in
the
loads
that
they
lift.
it's
not
a
governor
or
cut
off
on
the
equipment.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it
was
proper
because
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
it
wouldn't
have
broken.
the
only
thing
is
then
you
would
never
be
able
to
lift
your
loads
because
you've
got
inertia,
you've
got
the
operation
problems
and
all.
you've
got
to
have
it
at
some
point.
you
never
could
lift
a
three
ton
load
with
three
tons
with
a
cut
off
at
three
tons.
and
the
practice
evidently,
the
standard
practice
is,
it's
shown
that
you've
got
this
--
you
can
set
it
up
to
250%
of
the
safe
working
load
and
that's
what
we
--
we
have
less
than
200
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
oh,
no.
no.
that's
not
it.
you
--
in
other
words
--
you've
got
to
--
in
order
to
lift
the
load,
that's
--
that's
where
the
problem
comes
in.
in
order
to
lift
the
load
here
of
three
tons,
you
certainly
have
to
have
more
than
three
tons
pulling
power
to
raise
it.
and
in
this
case,
the
practice,
standard
practice
is,
the
coast
guard
regulation
says
that
a
maximum
setting
is
250%
of
the
safe
working
load
because
you
have
to
remember
here,
we
have
what
is
known
as
a
instantaneous
type
or
instantaneous
electromagnetic
cut
off.
in
other
words,
what
happens
is
this.
as
soon
as
the
current
reaches
a
certain
point,
the
whole
thing
cuts
out.
there
is,
in
fact,
this
testimony
by
one
of
the
witnesses
which
i
think
possibly
have
--
may
have
misled
judge
wortendyke
in
thinking
that
this
should
have
been
set
at
some
other
point.
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
about
a
thermal
relay
which
works
in
this
instance.
you
--
there
is
a
setting.
but
when
that's
--
point
is
--
when
that
setting
is
reached
then
heat
is
built
up.
and
then
when
the
heat
reaches
a
certain
point
then
it
goes
off.
now,
the
coast
guard
regulation
here
says,
250%.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
be
wrong
in
having
it
said
within
that
regulation.
i
don't
think
its
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
thank
you.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
thank
you,
sir.
if
it
please
the
court,
as
i
previously
pointed
out,
there
is
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case
that
the
cut
off
or
circuit
breaker
was
installed
solely
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
electric
motor.
now,
in
accordance
with
mr.
justice
harlan's
request,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
this
testimony
appears
on
page
42
at
the
top,
and
that
there
is
further
testimony
on
this
point
at
--
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
42
and
continuing
to
the
middle
of
page
43,
and
that
also
on
page
44
at
the
top
thereof
commencing
with
the
court,
there
is
--
such
testimony.
that
is
the
only
testimony
which
is
in
the
case
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
circuit
breaker.
now,
in
the
words
of
the
chief
mate
of
the
vessel,
who
happens
to
be
the
only
person
here
who
had
personal
knowledge
and
personal
experience
with
this
mechanism,
it
was
nothing
more
than
what
we
know
as
a
ordinary
household
fuse.
that
was
its
sole
purpose.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
controlling
the
load.
it
would
of
course
be
unfair
to
say
that
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
the
load
--
your
honor,
it
was
not
installed
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
the
load.
the
only
--
as
i
said
--
was
going
to
say,
if
the
load
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
became
excessive
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
that
does
have
some
effect
on
it
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
lift
the
loads,
you
have
to
have
in
effect
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
that's
true.
but,
that
--
i
mean,
the
thing
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
is
correct.
that
is
right.
but
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
this
mechanism.
in
other
words,
we
--
for
instance,
we
have
a
--
take
the
household
fuse,
is
there
to
prevent
fires,
but
it
certainly
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
doesn't
control
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
on
the
system.
that's
all
that
this
was
intended
to
prevent
and
by
preventing
excessive
load
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
is
right.
that
--
that
--
that
would
happen
incidentally
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
purpose
of
this
mechanism
because
we
have
in
order
to
cut
--
cut
off
the
--
the
mechanism,
we
have
a
lever
furnished
for
that
purpose
and
we
also
had
a
switch
that
was
on
the
mechanism
itself
so
that
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
i
--
i
am
afraid
that
if
i
gave
that
impression
--
i
do
not
contend
that
but
i
say
that
that
was
not
why
it
was
installed.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
assuming
that
such
a
purpose
could
be
attributed
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
what
effect
that
has?
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
this
--
this
was
not
--
this
was
not
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes.
this
is
not
suppose
to
control
the
load.
when
it
controls
the
load,
the
longshoreman
themselves
and
what
this
--
what
--
it
points
out
to
them
what
the
load
is
or
what
load
they
should
lift
is
a
marking
which
appears
on
the
boom.
its
--
its
international
practice,
every
vessel
has
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
three
ton.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it
was
not
an
ingredient
because
of
--
because
this
happens,
sir.
at
the
motor,
you
have
a
current
with
this
set
off
--
cut
off,
said
as
it
was,
you
get
a
current
quantity
of
six
tons.
that
is
true.
but,
by
the
time
--
because
of
the
nature
on
the
operation
of
this
mechanism,
by
the
time
you
get
down
here
to
where
the
load
is,
you
cannot
lift
a
six-ton
load
because
if
you
are
lifting
a
six-ton
load
this
would
cut
off.
you
have
a
six-ton
load
here,
it
would
never
start
up
because
--
i
mean,
this
--
this
is
a
machine
and
there
are
number
of
forces
acting
here
which
require
a
setting
here,
sufficiently
high
so
that
you
can
overcome
inertia,
you
can
overcome
these
other
forces
and
raise
a
three-ton
load
at
the
end
of
the
runner.
now,
if
you
had
this
set
at
three
tons
here
so
that
the
winch
as
soon
as
the
current
quantity
which
reads
the
winch
was
three
tons,
you
would
not
lift
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
you'd
never
lift
a
three-ton
load.
you
see,
that's
--
that's
why
a
setting
at
six
tons
on
the
current
here
is
not
an
unseaworthy
condition.
it's
not
a
condition
that
causes
this
accident
because
what
happened
here
was
this,
when
the
longshoreman
permitted
the
lumber
to
become
caught
under
the
coaming
here
and
continued
coaming.
what
happened
was
this
winch
then
started
to
pull.
it
was
exerting
this
power
on
here
but
this
load
was
not
then
moving
upward
so
that
your
current
kept
on
building
up.
it
had
to
build
up
being
caught
here.
you
actually
have
strange
as
it
may
sound,
this
was
computed
by
the
expert.
you
have
the
force
is
actively
doubling
while
up
here.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it's
--
yes,
it
was
irrelevant
for
this
reason
that
if
the
longshoreman
had
not
permitted
this
timber
to
become
caught
here.
and
if
after
it
had
become
caught,
they
did
not
continue
to
operate
the
winch.
the
force
would
never
have
been
built
up
here.
this
equipment
was
not
furnished
for
the
purpose
that
these
men
were
using,
that
they
were
trying
to
jam
out
a
piece
of
timber
that
had
become
caught.
that
obviously
is
not
the
purpose
of
it.
the
purpose
was
to
raise
timber
whether
the
boom
was
in
this
position
or
in
this
position
that's
originally
had
--
it
was
when
the
vessel
came
in.
they
had
operated
this
winch
for
one
hour
and
have
discharged
lumber
this
vessel
for
one
solid
hour
without
any
trouble
at
all.
one
of
the
reasons
was
they
weren't
trying
to
pull
the
vessel
apart.
that's
why
nothing
happened.
and
that's
--
that's
the
reason
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
in
other
words,
the
power
that
was
built
up
was
the
power
that
was
caused
by
this
timber
becoming
caught
here.
and
that's
what
caused
the
build
up
of
the
power.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
i
wouldn't
say
precisely
but
he
does
speak
of
mathematics
and
i
think
the
mathematics
he's
referring
to
is
this
--
if
there
was
tremendous
amount
of
calculations.
there
were
many
exhibits.
and
one
of
the
calculations
was
showing
how
when
a
timber
is
caught
or
when
something
is
caught
here,
the
power
stops
building
up
here
so
that
it
throws
everything
else
out
of
filter.
i
mean,
it's
--
it's
not
--
no
other
than
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it
is,
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
maybe
i
--
i
might
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
it's
because
this
load
--
when
you're
lifting
a
load
(inaudible)
--
just
for
the
little
weight
on
here,
you
will
notice
that
this
--
the
boom
does
move
but
as
soon
as
it
overcomes
the
weight,
it
moves
smoothly.
in
other
words,
i'm
now
applying
three
pounds
--
say
three
tons
to
lift
three
tons
here
or
only
roughly.
so
the
sample
point
of
course
has
to
lift
that
three
tons
here.
when
i
--
when
this
becomes
caught
that
i
start
pulling
here,
this
is
--
this
was
computed
by
an
expert.
i'm
not
only
having
this
boom
that's
pulling
this
down
but
this
because
it's
not
moving
is
also
pulling
it
down
so
you
are
getting
a
build
up
of
a
force
cork
up
here
from
this
boom
and
this
--
and
the
fact
that
this
is
not
moving.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes,
it
is.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
was
an
issue
to
which
the
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
if
it
--
to
some
extent
it
is,
(inaudible).
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
oh,
that's
right
because
of
the
fact
in
here.
he
insist
from
coming
over
--
so
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
so
that
way
--
that
--
that
way
they
part
also.
in
other
words,
what
we
have
here
is
now
a
parallelogram
of
force
(inaudible)
and
this
is
one
triangle
that
we
--
i
remember
in
your
computation,
this
was
one
triangle
that
was
worked
on
and
it
develop
stability,
certain
force
established
only
by
this
triangle.
then,
there
was
additional
force
established
in
this
triangle
created
by
then.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
so
that
it's
a
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
that's
true.
you
would
not
have
--
you
might
have
some
but
it
would
be
--
i
would
say
minor.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no.
in
fact
as
i
recall,
it's
not
in
this
record.
the
testimony
was
that
the
logs'
total
weight
was
about
1600
pounds.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
--
that
was
the
weight
of
the
two
logs
that
were
being
raised
at
the
time.
it's
not
in
this
record
here
but
it
is
the
testimony
of
witnesses,
about
1600
pounds.
before
that,
they
have
been
discharging
lumber
and
the
weight
of
that
was
never
obtained
but
even
the
pieces
of
lumber
that
they
piled
up
in
there
is
another
more
than
that
weight.
the
weight
i
would
say
was
--
the
pile,
the
graphs
up
on
the
woods
rail
and
then
what
they
were
trying
to
lift
at
this
moment
here.
they
made
a
--
that
this
is
a
special
graph
that
they
when
they're
--
when
they're
discharging
lumber,
they
have
but
it's
a
certain
height
and
a
certain
width.
so
that
they
tried
to
keep
more
with
up
to
what
the
working
load
of
the
gear
is,
but
i
don't
have
--
we
don't
have
the
weight
of
that
load
of
the
timber
that
they
--
or
lumber
rather.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
1600
pounds
was
the
testimony,
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it
was
either
10
by
10
or
12
by
12,
your
honor.
and
this
was
the
heavy
mahogany
logs.
now
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right,
sir.
it
wasn't
installed
for
that
purpose.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it
was
set
at
16
instead
of
six?
i
would
say
that
then
it
constituted
an
unsafe
condition.
you
mean,
if
it
was
set
at
16
tons
instead
of
six?
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
there
is
a
safety
factor
involved.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
experts
and
according
to
this
coast
guard
regulation,
the
setting
is
permitted
up
to
250%
of
the
safe
working
load,
which
in
this
case
with
a
safe
working
load
of
three
tons
would
mean
seven
and
seven
and
a
half
tons.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
this
was
a
little
more
than
six
tons,
so
we
were
well
within
the
250%.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
now
that
--
that
is
a
--
that
is
--
not
only
this
is
a
coast
guard
regulation
and
also
when
this
is
installed,
it's
installed
by
an
electrical
contractor
who
is
qualified
to
set
these
things
up.
in
other
words,
they're
experts.
they
set
that
up
and
it
stays
that
way.
nobody
on
a
ship
is
permitted
to
or
can
make
an
adjustment
on
it.
in
other
words,
this
is
--
once
it's
set,
it's
set
on
few
some
qualified
person
like
in
electrical
contractor
who
deals
in
that
particular
type
of
equipment
resets
it
or
rechecks
or
test
it.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i
think
it
--
we
would
have
a
problem
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
then.
yes,
so
far
as
to
safety.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
it's
--
it's
--
well,
it's
a
three-ton
working
load
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
this
is
a
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
we
have
to
remember
this
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
as
a
breaking
strain
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
and
actually
they
--
i
understand
that
they
compute
the
working
load
by
taking
a
piece
of
cable
and
stretching
it
until
it
breaks
and
then
when
it
--
whatever
tonnage
it
breaks
at,
they
usually
take
one-fifth
of
that
and
say
that
that
is
the
safe
working
load.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
now,
there
is
still
with
a
three-ton
safe
working
load
and
this
cable
having
a
breaking
strain
of
15
tons,
there's
a
safety
tolerance
of
12
tons.
if
we
go
to
six,
there's
still
a
safety
tolerance
as
of
nine
tons.
so
that
in
--
in
order
--
in
permitting
something
like
this
to
be
built
up
was
--
we
are
working
with
a
safety
tolerance.
i
mean,
we
are
way
within
that
point
where
it
becomes
dangerous.
in
other
words,
this
is
--
it's
still
safe.
we
have
a
safety
tolerance
of
nine
tons
before
this
thing
will
break
and
i
dare
say
that
within
this
wire
cable,
it's
not
like
a
piece
of
wood.
it
starts
breaking
--
wire
cable
this
actually
a
machine,
this
--
these
are
parts
that
move.
i
mean
if
you
can
take
a
piece
of
wire
cable,
you'll
see
that
they
move.
they
--
it's
like
a
machine,
they
move
over
each
other.
they
don't
break
like
the
fibers
do
on
a
piece
of
wood.
so
that
by
being
used,
by
being
subjected
to,
say
in
this
case,
occasional
stresses
of
six
tons
and
that
happens
very
rarely
incidentally.
it
only
happens
when
something
like
this
occurs.
that
doesn't
weaken
this
cable.
in
fact,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
breaking
strain
of
this
cable
had
not
been
diminished,
that
the
topping-lift
was
--
the
safe
working
load
of
that
topping-lift
was
at
least
15
tons.
they
didn't
say
--
this
trial
court
didn't
say
it
was
just
15,
it
said
it
was
at
least
15
tons
and
the
wire
cable
had
been
tested
shortly
after
the
accident
occurred.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
the
man
who
was
--
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
have
made
it
but
i
am
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we're
not
talking
about
the
breaking
point
of
this
wire
here.
and
after
the
accident
occurred,
it
was
taken
to
a
testing
laboratory
and
a
test
was
made
where
the
testing
laboratory,
by
means
of
a
testing
machine
which
they
have
which
applies
pressure
to
this
cable
showed
that
this
cable
broke,
if
i
recall
correctly,
under
a
pressure
of
19,600
pounds
which
indicates
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
he
himself
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
he
himself
probably
could
not
have
done
anything
about
that
other
than
--
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
had
put
the
wire
sling
around
this
and
had
attached
it
to
this
runner
and
have
to
stand
--
he
was
standing
there,
another
man
was
giving
signals
to
the
winchman
to
go
ahead
so
that
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
he
himself
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
we
--
we
have
not
raised
any
issue
of
contributory
negligence
but
he
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it's
up
to
his
employer.
i
--
i
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well
i
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it's
his
employer's
fault.
i
mean
actually
it's
his
employers
fault
because
they
were
stevedores
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
they
are
experts.
they
know
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
in
that
operation
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
in
that
--
in
that
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
nobody
could
have
changed
the
setting
but
this
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
these
longshoremen
were
at
fault
because
they
tried
to
pull
out
--
i
mean,
i
think
it's
common
sense
when
a
timber
becomes
jammed,
you
should
stop
it
but
they
continued
pulling
it.
that's
where
the
whole
fault
lies.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
only
had
--
he
had
a
lever
on
this
winch
by
means
at
which
he
was
applying
the
power.
he
was
pushing
to
lever
ahead.
all
he
had
to
do
is
pull
it
back
into
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
he
could
--
he
could
see
that
the
timber
was
caught.
he
should
know
that
something
was
going
to
break
when
this
timber
is
not
moving
and
its
caught
here.
something
is
going
to
break.
you
can't
--
i
mean
it's
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it's
obvious
that
something
is
going
to
break
when
he
--
when
this
--
when
the
power
is
continued
to
be
applied
to
the
winch.
they're
trying
to
pull
this
thing
up,
it's
not
moving,
something
has
to
break.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right,
it's
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
he
didn't
have
any
right.
in
fact,
he
says
he
didn't
even
know
that
this
existed.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
there
was
a
cut
off
on
here.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
he
had
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
is
correct
because
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
the
employer
knows
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
we
have
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
there's
a
marking.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
on
the
first
place,
there's
a
marking
on
the
boom
that
you
shouldn't
lift
more
than
three
tons.
that's
international
practice.
it's
recognized
by
all
(inaudible)
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
the
second
thing
is
this,
your
honor,
that
when
this
became
caught
here,
anybody
should
know
that
you
can't
pull
it
out
if
it's
jammed.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i
mean,
that's
what
i
was
saying,
they
should
have
stopped.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
issues.
yes,
on
the
claim
over
that
they
--
that
their
negligence
was
what
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
because
in
not
stopping
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
the
winch
after
this
timber
became
jammed
and
it
became
perfectly
obvious
that
they
couldn't
get
it
out
by
continuing
to
apply
power
of
the
winch.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
--
i
say,
that's
the
sole
cause
of
the
accident
and
there
should
be
no
responsibility
on
the
vessel
either
under
these
facts,
that
they
are
the
ones
who
caused
the
accident.
this
cut
off
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
occurrence
of
the
accident.
they
didn't
rely
on
it.
they
had
no
business
to
rely
on
it.
it
was
not
intended
for
that
purpose.
now,
to
see
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
may
i
say,
your
honors,
not
reconcilable
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
they
don't
because
if
the
approximate
cause
of
this
accident
was
the
negligence
of
the
stevedores
in
the
way
they
tried
to
discharge
this
vessel,
then
that's
what
caused
the
accident.
it's
not
some
other
condition.
in
fact,
later
on
in
the
--
discussing
the
indemnity
claim,
the
court
says
that
--
in
fact
it's
on
page
33,
said
that
they
find
to
--
they
find
that
it's
failed
to
exercise,
it
mean
nacirema.
they
exercised
that
degree
of
care
and
that
as
a
result
thereof,
it
brought
into
play
the
unseaworthy
condition.
in
other
words,
it's
saying,
"well,
if
this
thing
failed
to
commence
with
a
backdoor
and
stopped
this
accident."
that
is
in
effect
what
the
district
court
is
saying
and
that's
why
it
held
us
responsible.
in
other
words,
because
our
equipment
did
not
prevent
these
people
from
being
negligent,
therefore,
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy.
that
is
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
which
i
submit
is
erroneous.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
what
the
district
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
what
the
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
the
district
court
--
that's
what
the
district
court
says
but
actually,
your
honor,
it
find
me
being
negligent,
they
create
a
condition.
then,
anything
that
the
vessel
furnishes
can't
be
operated
or
used
for
the
purpose
for
which
it's
intended
because
we
now
have
something
entirely
different
and
apart
from
what
this
thing
is
intended
to
be
used
for
or
the
operation.
instead
of
--
if
they
--
if
they
were
purely
discharging
timber
and
this
thing
broke
we
would
--
in
fact,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
they
--
at
the
time
this
happened,
they
weren't
there.
there
was
an
officer
who
was
in
charge.
this
is
a
two-hatch
vessel
incidentally.
the
officer
went
between
the
number
one
hatch
and
the
number
two
hatch
was
just
back
off
the
housing
that's
in
the
middle
of
the
ship.
he
had
been
here
for
some
15
or
20
minutes
before
the
accident
happened.
he
then
went
back
to
number
two
hatch.
he
was
there
for
a
period
of
time
and
while
he
was
there
this
accident
occurred,
so
that
he
was
not
aware
of
what
has
been
going
on.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
it
would
not
have
been
unseaworthy.
it
couldn't
have
been
unseaworthy.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
well,
this
--
this
still
we
--
we
get
away
from
what
the
proximate
and
in
fact
in
the
words
of
the
district
court,
the
sole
cause
of
the
accident
was
that
was
trying
to
lift
this
timber
after
it
had
become
jammed
behind
the
coaming.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
you
have
to
because
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes,
because
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
yes.
because
you
have
to.
you
--
this
couldn't
possibly
have
happened,
all
the
other
things
are
purely
conditions
that
exist.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i
say
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that
i
--
that
is
my
position,
sir.
it
does
not
answer
into
it
because
it
--
if
--
if
the
longshoreman
did
not
try
to
lift
this
timber
after
it
had
become
caught
in
there,
this
thing
would
never
have
come
into
play.
that's
what
--
you
have
to
go
back
to
that
again
and
again
in
order
to
get
the
explanation
of
this
accident
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
anything
else
that
occurred
afterward
or
it
may
have
come
into
play
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
occurrence
of
the
accident.
it
would
have
occurred
no
matter
what.
it
would
not
have
occurred
if
the
--
if
that
jamming
had
not
occurred
and
these
people
have
not
tried
to
jam
it
out.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
that's
right.
the
setting
is
not
--
as
i
say,
the
setting
is
irrelevant.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
no,
it
cut
off
at
--
it
was
--
it
didn't
reach
the
point
or
it
cut
off
at
the
place
where
it
was
said,
but
this
--
it
occurred
sometime
after
the
accident
happened
or
it
occurred
at
the
same
the
accident
happened.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it's
likely
it
did
--
that
--
that
is
right.
it's
likely
that
it
couldn't
have
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
not
--
no.
it's
likely
that
it
wouldn't.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
it's
likely
that
it
wouldn't
happen
because
we
still
have
this
other
factors
developing
even
with
a
three-ton
load,
but
that's
--
now
--
now
lifting
a
three-ton
load,
applying
this
power
of
three
tons.
i
--
i
can't
--
i
mean,
i
would
concede
if
i
could
that
that
is
so,
but
i
can't
because
there
were
other
factors
involved
here
which
make
it
so.
i
would
say
that
probably
if
it
was
set
at
three
tons,
this
might
not
have
happened,
but
i
can
guarantee
that
it
wouldn't
have
happened
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
because
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
they
--
you
can't,
then
you
can't
lift.
you
can't
lift
it.
you
couldn't
lift
a
three-ton
load
--
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
--
at
the
end
of
the
runner
here
then.
mr.
victor
s.
cichanowicz
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
not
gotten
to
my
course
--.[laughter]
