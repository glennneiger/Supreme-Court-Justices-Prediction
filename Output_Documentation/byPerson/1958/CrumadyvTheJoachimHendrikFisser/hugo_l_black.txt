supposed
just
before

we'll
assume
it

it
reached

that
he
cut

off,
would
it
have
broke?
justice

it
wouldn't?
justice
hugo

black
(voice

--
if
it
had
been
cut

back

that
there'd
been
a
safety.
that
thing
had
functioned
before
it
reached
the
breaking
point,
it
wouldn't
have
broken,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
point
you're
saying.
now,
you're
saying
that
even
though
the
cut
off
wasn't
fixed
that
it
worked,
had
restricted
the
other
place
but
that
was
proper.
justice
hugo

black
but
you
do
not
deny
--
you
do
not
deny
that
it
had
been
limited
to
the
point
of
safety
there,
so
it
cut
off
before
it
reach
the
breaking
point,
then
it
wouldn't
have
broken.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
could
--
they
could
put
on
two
and
a
half
tons
more
weight
than
this,
it
was
marked
being
safe
to
operate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
this
man
who
was
hit
make
that
computation?
i
don't
quite
understand
that
yet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
was
--
what
i
was
wondering
about
is
--
probably
because
i
have
my
mechanical
mind
is
a
little
lacking,
i
admit
it
readily.
what
i'm
wondering
is
this,
you
have
a
winch
there
or
a
circuit
breaker
and
it's
marked
three
tons,
if
that's
what
the
mark.
there's
a
man
working
down
in
this
place,
a
log
falls
--
the
boom
falls
on
him
because
this
wire
breaks.
what
did
he
do
wrong
there
himself?

could
he
have

should
have
called

if

figures

this
--
this

there
--

what
--
what
--
justice

black
that
the
--
(voice

--
justice
hugo

that's
their

do
you
say
that's
in
--

pleading?
justice

is
that
the

pleading
here,
the
--
justice

and
you
say
it
was
his

in
not
doing
what?
justice

could
we
have
changed

the

could
you

but
if
he
looked
at
that
(voice

justice

they
continued.
how
could
they
have
stop
pulling
it?
justice
hugo

black
if
giving
the
power
and
was
there
a
notice
on
that,
it
said
anything
about
when
he
was
to
stop
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
this
thing
might
break
or
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
was
getting
down
that
or
where
i
think
maybe
i
can
understand
it
and
maybe
when
the
other
man
argues
with.
as
i
understand
now,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
evidence
shows
without
dispute
that
the
asserted
fact
which
made
it
necessary
for
this
--
the
employer
of
this
man
to
refrain
from
pulling
or
putting
that
power
on
any
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
had
no
right
at
all
to
depend
on
the
fact
that
there
was
of
marked
limitation
of
the
capacity
in
connection
with
the
lifting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
know
that
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
found
out.
now,
the
--
what
you
say,
i
gather
is,
how
could
the
employer
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
much
weight
was
being
put
on
there?
what
--
what
signal
was
it?
what
kind
of
safety
device
did
you
have
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that
it
will
work
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
would
know
that
it
was
reaching
a
point
where
it
might
break.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we're
they
limiting
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
main
issue
between
you
and
the
employer
of
this
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
would
claim
that
it's
due
--
it's
their
negligence.
and
your
claim
is
that
they
were
negligent
because
of
what
in
simply
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
that
was
the
sole
cause.
they
had
no
right
to
depend
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
limitation
for
the
--
as
to
the
amount
of
power
that
should
be
turned
loose
on
that
winch?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
what
you
concluded,
meaning
holding
by
end
that
the
nacirema
was
negligent
that
brought
this
harm?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
nevertheless,
there
was
some
kind
of
non-delegable
duty
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
to
see
that
this
employee
wouldn't
hurt
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
made
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
ship's
officers
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
turned
it
over
to
nacirema
with
all
of
these
parts
that
you
talked
about
in
the
position
that
you
say
brought
them
out,
the
dangerous
condition.
that's
the
way
to
turned
it
over
to
nacirema.
would
you
say
that
then
when
they
turned
it
over
to
him
before
he
did
anything
at
all,
that
this
vessel
would
have
been
unseaworhty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
thought
it
dangerous
and
turned
it
over
and
suppose
they
did
that
and
he
--
there
was
these
logs
down
and
he
was
to
lift
them
up.
you'd
still
say
that
it
was
not
have
been
unseaworthy
and
that
--
what
seems
to
be
--
intended
to
be,
they
have
normal
place
on
one
of
these
parts
that
down
there,
whatever
they
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
always
come
back
to
that
one
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
was
just
trying
to
get
an
preference
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
i
thought
you
said,
i
gathered
from
all
the
arguments,
it
would
have
been
difference.
because
if
it
had
cut
off
before
that,
this
thing
couldn't
have
happened,
irrespective
of
every
--
of
the
necirema's
negligence.
if
it
had
cut
off
at
the
place
where
it
said
there,
it
wouldn't
have
happened,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
had
been
limited,
if
this
set
off,
if
this
thing
had
worked
in
a
way
and
when
it
got
three
ton
pressure
on
it,
or
a
tension,
or
whatever
you
call
it,
it
cut
off,
then
this
wouldn't
have
happened,
wouldn't
it?
because
they
couldn't
have
kept
pouring
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

it
couldn't
have
done
it,
could
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
power
in
it,
it
couldn't
happen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
my
fault
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
this
serve
you
now?
tell
us,
what
it
is
you
are
referring
on,
what
it's
about
in
plain
language.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
excuse
me.
may
i
ask
you,
suppose
if
we
would
affirm
what
the
district
court
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
then
you
would
be
out
according
to
your
argument,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
we
should
not
affirm
and
we
revert?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
were
called
on
the
reason
this
question
of
the
right
--
of
the
right.is
it
your
contention
that
we
should
decide
it
here
or
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
planning
to
get
down
to
what
--
what
your
point
is.
let's
suppose
now
that
we're
not
going
to
affirm
it.
so,
you've
got
to
state
your
the
position
on
something
and
you
have
indicated
that
the
court
made
a
bad
finding
at
least
on
its
ground.
the
court
had
said
that
it
made
its
finding
on
undisputed
evidence
as
to
where
this
guy
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
preventer
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
now,
let's
suppose
that
that's
not
it.
when
do
we
reach
the
point
where
you
would
take
the
position
or
when
you
did
take
the
position
in
the
court
below
on
how
this
thing
happened
and
why
you're
not
allowed
before
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
outside
of
that
one
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
defective?
justice

black
it
was
defective?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo

black
and
you're
not
asked
as
to
change
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
your
other
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
raising
that
question?
are
you
arguing
it?
did
you
take
a
position
on
it?
justice

black
what
is
--
what
was
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let's
get
away
from
the
"ifs",
i
can't
understand
your
position
here
because
of
your
"ifs".
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
--
did
you
challenge
the
law
or
do
you
challenge
here
the
statement
that
this
cut
off
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
there
was
no
defect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
way
it
was
set?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
right
did
you
have
to
rely
on
that?
what
findings
were
made
by
the
court
with
reference
to
that?
and
if
there
are
no
findings
made
with
reference
to
it,
what
do
you
point
as
to
the
(inaudible),
that
that
was
--
you
had
a
right
to
rely
on
that,
you're
not
putting
all
--
of
--
being
the
cut
off
if
it
reached
the
three-ton
threshold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
i'm
asking
you
for,
are
you
basing
it
on
findings
of
facts
on
evidence,
as
on
finding
of
facts
where
all
of
these
are
based
on
evidence.
where
is
it?
justice

what
page

what

justice

the

i'm
reading

the

the

made
no

particular
issue?
justice

now,
is
that
consistent
with
what
he
found
above
unless
you
go
to
the

instead
of
saying
that
even
though
your

the
negligence
brought
about

you
have
any
evidence

show

the

indicates
an
occurrence

the

were

work
you
were

the
right

break

is
there
any
witnesses

disputed
what
your
two
experts
said

this

standard
practice,
state
