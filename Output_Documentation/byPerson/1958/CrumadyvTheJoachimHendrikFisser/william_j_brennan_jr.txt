justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
to
teach
justice
frankfurter
here,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
they
do?
loosen
that
boom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
swung
it
over
which
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
do
you
call
the
top
of
it
and
that's
the
cable,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
was
the
cable,
core
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that
completely.
do
you
say
that
this
work
rate
now,
the
strain
on
the
topping-lift
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
might
that
not
have
been
developed
even
if
the
winch
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
those
--
i
think
you've
said
there
is
a
vagueness
of
the
finding
of
unseaworthiness,
dealing
with
the
fact
that
the
winch
--
the
governor
of
the
winch
is
set
at
six
tons.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yet
you
say
that
the
actual
strain
was
(inaudible)
somewhere
between
17
and
21?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
want
to
get
back
to
the
governor
on
the
winch.
why
--
why
wouldn't
--
if
it
went
off
at
six,
what
may
have
developed
from
the
six
to
the
17
to
21
that
wouldn't
have
been
developed
from
the
17
to
21
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
you
say,
at
three,
the
governor
has
been
set
forth
at
three.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
than
nine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
get
this.
if
--
if
it
takes
more
current
than
the
three
tons
on
the
winch
to
lift
three
tons,
then
does
it
make
it
go
off
at
some
point
higher
than
three
tons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
theoretically
affect
you
--
cut
the
circuit
breaker,
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
we
get
--
(inaudible)
with
the
power
set
at
some
surplus
sufficient
to
raise
a
little
more
than
six.
in
this
respect,
a
circuit
breaker
could
go
off
when
the
actual
weight
being
lifted
was
something
in
--
more
than
six
tons.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
waste
your
time
now
but
i
would
like
to
have
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
ask
one
other
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
testimony
at
all
of
what
the
opinion
was
on
you
that
were
--
should
have
been
above
the
amount
of
power
so
far
as
to
raise
this
current?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they're
115?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
--
what
does
it
fix
--
fix
on
the
way
of
translation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
asked
to
the
pole
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
timber
was
caught
underneath.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
weight
of
the
timber
was
still
quite
it
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
like,
about
three
tons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
actually
though,
the
--
the
pressures
that
judge
wortendyke
was
talking
about
would
give
the
application
of
the
power
to
the
runner
and
assigned
when
the
lumber
would
have
caught
the
coaming,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
strain
with
the
application
of
the
power
to
a
runner
which
was
fine
to
lift
log
from
the
court
to
this
coaming.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
the
square
over
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
might
have
happened
even
without
the
shifting
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
before
you
--
can
i
ask
this
one
first.
after
the
cut
off
(inaudible)
continued
application
of
power
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
after
trial,
how
was
it,
let's
assume
the
cut
off
power
was
still
applied
with
a
certain
pressure
on
that
stacked
--
no,
stacked
log
under
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
pulled
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
pulled
that
thing
--
it
would
show
us
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
the
--
once
you
give
it
the
application
of
electric
power
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
a
matter
of
fact.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
one
--
what
point
did
the
electric
power
go
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
want
to
miss
that
point
in
here
but
i
still
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
don't
follow.
how
is
it
that
there
were
these
pressures
with
17
to
21,
whatever
it
was,
applied
in
the
cut
off
(inaudible)
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
someone
were
to
clear
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
what
the
cable
under
which
has
already
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
the
time
of
the
cut
off?
and
there,
whatever
the
strain
is,
the
time
of
the
cut
off
which
stays
there
because
you've
got
the
timbers
stuck
into
the
coaming
and
the
whole
thing
has
been
pulled
tightly
together
for
the
winch
--
for
the
timber,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
point.
and
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
whatever
is
on
the
winch,
the
cable
off
the
winch
stays
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
went
either
way,
don't
you,
mr.
monigan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
if
whether
--
whether
his
liability
and
the
shipowner
because
of
the
defect
or
because
solely
the
negligence
of
nacirema.
aren't
you
out
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
--
suppose
that
they
were
not
correctly
respectively
cut
off
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
--
what
the
trial
judge
find
as
a
fact
as
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
location
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
district
court
held
you
liable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
what
kind
of
a
charter
this
was
