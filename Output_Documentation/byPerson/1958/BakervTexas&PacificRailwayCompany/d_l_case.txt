mr.
d.
l.
case
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
call
the
facts
to
the
court's
attention
before
going
into
the
question
of
law.
thus,
the
evidence
of
this
case
shows
that
the
respondent
entered
into
a
contract
in
writing
with
the
nichols
company
as
a
result
of
advertising
four
bids.
two
bids
were
received
and
the
bid
of
nichols
was
accepted
by
respondent.
the
deceased
was
an
employee
of
the
respondent.
the
testimony
is
uncontroverted.
that
respondent
hired
its
own
employees
including
deceased,
told
them
when
to
go
to
work
or
come
to
work,
when
to
take
off
for
lunch,
when
to
quit
for
the
day,
paid
their
salaries
or
wages,
withheld
for
social
security
and
then
all
the
other
things
that
are
usual
and
customary
in
an
employer-employee
relationship.
the
history
of
this
case
is
that
it
has
been
tried
for
the
jury
twice.
as
the
court
knows
in
texas,
our
practice
is
to
submit
cases
to
the
jury
on
special
issues.
in
both
cases,
the
jury
convicted
respondent
of
certain
acts
of
negligence
approximately
causing
the
death
and
in
both
cases
convicted
the
deceased
of
certain
acts
of
negligence
approximately
causing
his
death.
petitioners
seek
the
benefit,
i
assume,
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
comparative
negligence.
now,
as
i
view
the
petitioner's
argument,
their
first
approach
is
that
the
work
in
question
was
non-delegable.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes.
i'll
be
glad
to
add
immediately,
your
honor.
the
contracts
did
not
spell
out
in
detail
itself
the
exact
work
to
be
done.
that
is
it
didn't
say
between
mile
post
one
and
mile
post
ten
you
can
do
this
grouting.
it
gave
the
general
limits.
the
plans
and
specifications
that
were
set
out
with
the
invitations
to
bid
did
give
into
a
considerable
more
detail
and
work
to
be
done.
now,
the
contract
on
its
face
says
that
the
contract
of
nichols
shall
occupy
the
status
of
an
independent
contractor
and
not
to
be
a
subject
to
the
detail
control
of
the
respondent.
the
testimony
is
undisputed
that
the
respondent
specified
in
the
contract
and
in
the
invitations
to
bid,
the
general
limits
within
which
the
work
would
be
done.
the
work
was
not
done
continuously
and
consecutively
throughout
those
limits.
respondent's
engineering
department
determined
the
areas
of
unstable
tracks
and
advised
the
contractor
of
the
areas
in
which
the
work
was
to
be
done.
now,
before
i
forget
it
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
discharge
the
contractor
as
well,
simply,
there's
no
provision
in
the
contract
to
that
effect
and
under
the
law
of
our
state,
he
has
reasonable
time
within
which
to
do
the
work
and
a
contractor
is
not
terminable
at
will.
i
think
it
is
a
misstatement
of
the
law
by
the
petitioner
as
to
the
contract
as
being
subject
to
being
discharged
at
will.
now,
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
grouting
is
done,
i
think
that
the
petitioner
misconceives
the
actual
manner
in
which
the
work
is
done
and
that
that
leads
to
some
confusion
as
to
the
exercise
of
control.
it
was
the
obligation
under
the
contract
for
respondent
to
select
the
areas
to
be
grouted
and
to
advise
the
contractor
of
those
areas.
now,
apparently,
petitioner
conceives
of
grouting
as
being
in
the
nature
of
an
easter
egg
hunt
to
seek
out
a
particular
water
pocket
here
and
one
there
and
inject,
excuse
me,
and
inject
the
mixture
in
only
those
parts.
the
record
does
not
bear
that
out.
the
limits
of
unstable
track
are
specified
by
the
engineering
department
and
are
designated
to
the
contractor
and
within
those
limits,
the
embedment
are
right
away
as
fill
solidly
with
the
material.
it's
not
a
matter
of
finding
a
little
spot
here
and
one
across
the
track
over
there
but
within
limits
of
so
many
feet
or
yards
to
build
a
track
that's
set
forth
of
the
material.
now,
the
testimony
that
the
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
no,
that
means
that
you
pump
as
much
of
the
material
into
the
roadbed
and
that
whole
section
as
a
roadbed
will
absorb.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
l.
case
now,
as
i
conceive
or
understand
the
testimony
with
reference
to
the
engineering
department
or
to
inspect
or
marking
the
tracks
or
ties
that
was
a
designation
of
the
area
in
which
the
work
was
to
be
done
and
understanding
the
true
nature
of
the
grouting
work,
i
believe
the
record
supports
the
testimony
of
the
respondent's
witnesses
that
is
even
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner.
and
there
is
no
conflict.
that
the
inspector
merely
designated
the
area
in
which
the
points
were
to
be
inserted
in
the
mixture
pumps
as
distinguished
from
saying
bring
it
over
here,
here
is
the
spot
and
here's
the
spot
over
here.
now,
as
far
as,
i
believe
the
points
of
testimony
also
that
respondent's
inspector
had
told
them
to
move
or
at
what
distance
rather
to
set
the
machines
with
reference
to
the
tracks
right
away.
under
our
statutes
in
texas,
there
is
a
minimum
distance
of
clearance
required
for
any
obstructions
adjacent
to
a
track
and
certainly,
any
instructions
that
the
inspector
gave
in
that
connection
were
with
regard
to
safety
in
the
normal
operations
of
respondent's
operations.
now,
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
have
recognized
that
particularly
in
bond
against
railroad
that
the
giving
of
necessary
instructions
or
information
and
the
inspection
of
the
progress
of
the
work
to
see
that
the
work
is
done
in
accordance
with
the
contract,
does
not
constitute
a
taking
over
of
control
or
test
of
control
so
as
to
transform
the
otherwise
independent
contractor
into
an
employee.
we
submit
that
the
evidence
relied
upon
by
petitioners
is
nothing
more
than
that
character
of
information
which
the
contract
called
upon
respondent
to
give
the
petitioner
and
that
character
of
supervision
or
surveillance
as
it
had
arrived
to
maintain
to
see
that
it
got
what
it
bargained
for.
so
we
say
that
there
was
no
jury
issue
on
the
correct
--
the
actual
exercise
of
the
right
of
control.
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
say
that
it
is
not
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
control
which
is
important
or
controlling.
it
is
the
right
of
control.
the
contract
itself
spells
out
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
parties.
it
is
the
right
of
control
and
not
the
exercise
of
control
as
the
court
said
in
bond
against
railroad
and
that
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
sound
law
for
this
reason.
the
relationships
of
the
parties
are
entered
into
solemnly
by
written
contracts.
they
tried
to
fix
their
respective
positions.
they
say
who
shall
have
the
right
of
control
and
who
shall
not.
if
because
some
--
some
particular
employee
of
the
railroad
on
some
occasion
make
some
suggestion
or
give
some
instruction
whether
authorized
by
his
employer
or
not,
to
an
employee
of
the
contractor,
if
that
by
it
said
changes
the
whole
relationship
then
there
can
be
no
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes.
mr.
d.
l.
case
as
i
have
conceived
it,
it
may
be
evidence
that
the
contract
is
not
what
it
says
on
its
face
than
it
is
and
it
may
be
evidence
that
the
contracts
or
written
contract
was
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
it
may
mark
the
notification
of
the
contract
if
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
don't
believe
that
it
would,
your
honor
unless
it
is
a
case
of
an
oral
agreement
so
that
the
acts
done
show
what
the
agreement
was
or
unless
it
may
be
evidence
that
the
written
contract
was
merely
a
sham
or
a
substance
of
that
nature.
i
think
that
the
parties
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
well
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
well,
i
believe
the
bond
case
as
it
is
the
right
of
control
and
not
the
act.
mr.
d.
l.
case
bond
against
railroad,
cited
in
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes.
yes,
your
honor
and
i'm
relying
on
that
case
and
other
similar
to
it.
and
i
take
it
that
otherwise,
if
by
an
isolated
answer
even
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
say
not
in
isolated
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
how
many
times
whether
it
was
once
or
every
day
or
several
times
a
day
when
i
say
that
the
railroad
employee
did
was
to
give
information
as
to
where
the
work
was
to
be
done
and
to
see
that
the
railroad
got
the
job
that
it
contracted
for
and
that
it
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
that.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
think
to
its
own
employees,
it
has
a
non-delegable
duty
to
maintain
a
safe
place
in
which
they
are
to
work.
mr.
d.
l.
case
and
that
your
answer
is
that
--
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
a
particular
case
but
it
maybe
that
the
railroad
would
be
liable.
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
suppose
under
the
sinkler
case
that
the
railroad
would
be
liable.
mr.
d.
l.
case
well,
i
can
answer
your
honor
only
by
--
in
this
manner
that
it
has
never
been
held
insofar
as
i
know
that
a
railroad
owes
a
non-delegable
duty
to
its
employees
to
perform
work
of
this
character
only
by
its
employees.
in
dougall
against
spokane
railroad,
certiorari
denied.
it
was
specifically
held
that
the
railroad
does
not
have
a
non-delegable
duty
to
perform
work
only
by
--
if
that
work
was
the
cleaning
of
the
embankment
and
work
--
generally
out
doing
work
held
that
it
--
there
was
not
a
non-delegable
duty
to
perform
that
work
only
with
its
own
employee
so
that
there
could
not
be
an
independent
contractor
relationship
in
any
event.
mr.
d.
l.
case
well,
in
the
dougall
case,
it
was
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
reading
the
records
substantially,
just
ordinary
maintenance.
now,
i
would
like
to
reply
to
mr.
davis
in
that
connection
about
whether
this
is
ordinary
or
extraordinary
and
what
significance
it's
has.
mr.
d.
l.
case
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
l.
case
how
i
feel?
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
feel
that
it's
his
own
failure
to
keep
a
proper
lookout
for
his
own
safety
was
the
cause
of
it.
mr.
d.
l.
case
he
had
his
back
turned
towards
the
oncoming
train.
it
is
true
there
were
two
trains
passing
at
about
the
same
time
in
the
vicinity
of
where
the
accident
occurred.
this
was
a
double
track.
and
he
apparently
had
his
back
turned
to
the
train
which
struck
him.
he
was
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
track
if
he
had
remained
there
rather
than
looking
to
his
rear
before
he
turned
and
walked
on
to
the
track,
he
obviously
walked
on
to
the
track
and
was
killed.
mr.
d.
l.
case
the
plaintiff,
as
i
understand
the
case,
relied
on
numerous
acts
and
his
pleadings
and
then
they
requested
the
issues
which
he
request
to
submit.
he
relied
on
speed,
failure
to
give
warning
by
whistle
or
other
signal.
and
i'm
not
certain
of
this
but
he
may
have
claimed
that
the
dissident's
attention
was
diverted
by
the
train
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
on
the
opposite
track
but
in
essence,
his
claim
is
that
the
railroad
engine
crew
failed
to
keep
a
proper
lookout,
fail
to
warn
him
and
that's
about
it
and
perhaps
speed.
mr.
d.
l.
case
that's
correct.
that
was
assessed
as
though
it
were
an
ordinary
crossing
case
as
far
as
the
acts
of
negligence
are
that
they
were
allowed.
mr.
d.
l.
case
no,
i
don't
question
at
all.
mr.
d.
l.
case
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
l.
case
if
(voice
overlap)
if
he
were
an
employee,
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
law?
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
think
that
there
has
been
no
submission
of
the
issue
submitting
the
theory
of
comparative
negligence.
mr.
d.
l.
case
and
in
any
event
that
the
case,
if
reversed,
it
would
have
to
be
reversed
and
remand
it
for
this
trial.
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
think
so,
in
order
for
the
jury
to
be
able
to
compare
the
negligence
otherwise,
you'll
see
it
hardly
how
the
jury
could
file
a
percentage
of
negligence.
mr.
d.
l.
case
on
the
delegability
of
this
work,
i
would
like
to
return
to
that
again
for
a
moment
and
use
the
analogy
of
the
railroad
contracting,
let's
say
american
car
and
a
founder
company
for
box
cars.
i
think
it
would
hardly
be
asserted
that
the
railroad
couldn't
contract
with
the
manufacturer
of
box
cars
to
build
its
cars
to
its
best
cases
and
certainly,
it
owes
just
as
much
of
an
obligation
to
the
public
to
maintain
its
equipment
as
it
does
on
its
right
of
way.
therefore,
on
the
basis
of
dougall
and
the
others
cited
in
our
brief
and
on
the
basis
of
factors,
i
see
no
reason
why
the
work
can't
be
delegated.
and
the
very
act
itself
requires
the
plaintiff
to
first
establish
that
her
decedent
was
an
employee,
the
word
employee
being
used
in
its
usual
and
ordinary
sense.
that
is
also
stated
in
dougall.
i
believe
it's
stated
in
bond
and
in
robinson
and
others
cited
in
our
brief.
on
this
question,
so
we
say
that
there
is
no
question
of
non-delegable
duty
and
as
far
as
any
evidence
of
it,
there
being
any
purpose
or
intent
or
scheme
on
the
part
of
respondent
to
evade
the
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
act,
there
simply
is
no
evidence.
i
believe
counsel
for
petitioners
stated
here
that
he
agreed
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
intent
but
says
that
it
comes
from
the
necessary
effects
of
the
contract.
i
think
to
say
that
is
to
beg
the
question.
first,
he
must
show
that
he
had
an
employment
status
with
the
railroad
otherwise,
if
the
mere
fact
that
you
entered
into
a
contract
with
an
independent
contractor,
and
if
it's
sustained
as
an
independent
contract
of
necessity,
he
doesn't
come
under
the
act.
in
that
case,
every
independent
contract
would
be
a
scheme
or
device
to
evade
the
act.
there
simply
is
no
evidence
of
intent
and
in
the
case
relied
upon
by
petitioners,
the
court
specifically
stated
that
the
alleged
employee
had
the
burden
of
proving
employment
or
proving
a
scheme
or
device
to
evade
the
provisions
of
the
act.
the
petitioner
simply
has
not
met
that
burden
of
proof.
and
as
far
as
the
--
i
was
going
to
say
something
about
the
extraordinary
maintenance
character
of
the
work.
i
would
think
the
way
that
got
in
to
this
lawsuit
is
that
the
petitioner
pled
in
this
petition
that
was
extraordinary
maintenance.
apparently,
rely
--
rely
--
that
it
was
ordinary
maintenance,
apparently
relying
on
the
dicta
in
miles
whether
it's
an
old
issue
of
facts,
i
don't
know.
if
it
was
and
if
there
were
an
evidence
whatsoever,
raising
an
issue
of
the
intent
on
the
part
of
respondent
to
evade
the
provisions
of
the
act
then
under
our
procedural
rules,
the
petitioner
has
waived
any
right

the

requesting

or
desiring
a
benefit
of

finding
request
such
issue

any

mr.
d.
l.
case
state
procedure
and
i
submit
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
think
so,
your
honor
but
i
think
there
is
nothing
you
need
about
it.
it's
all
gathered
in
somewhat
rule
51
if
the
federal
rules.
so
i
think
there's
nothing.
no
advice
on
it
as
opposed
to
the
federal
procedure.
mr.
d.
l.
case
well,
certainly
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
certainly,
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
is
one
inquiring
that.
assume
that
it
does
have
the
non-delegable
duty
certainly
to
the
public
to
operate
its
trains.
and
it
may
be
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
in
the
fact
is
historical
work
--
historical
nature
of
the
work.
railroads
historically
have
operated
its
own
trains.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
railroad
or
any
other
railroad
has
historically
done
grouting
work.
it
may
be
that
there
are
certain
types
of
maintenance
work
or
unloading
and
loading
of
cars
that
because
of
the
historical
relationship
of
railroad
and
employee
could
not
be
delegated.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes.
well,
i
think
it
may
have
a
necessary
relationship
to
section
55,
your
honor.
the
cases
that
have
said
that
have
found
that
it
was
railroad
work
and
that
the
people
were
employees,
have
a
history
for
example
and
some
of
the
cases
where
the
work
was
formerly
done
by
the
railroad
and
valuable
facilities
were
donated
by
the
railroad
to
the
contractor
to
do
the
work
which
was
formerly
done
by
the
railroad
and
the
contractor
was
made
up
largely
of
the
railroad's
former
employees.
and
it's
called
logic,
looking
only
at
one
section
and
not
the
other,
i
suppose
that
there's
no
basis
for
a
distinction
unless
it
is
historical.
that's
the
only
answer
i
can
give.
is
my
time
over,
your
honor?
mr.
d.
l.
case
now,
on
the
question
of
applying
sinkler
to
this
case,
there
is
no
historical
background
in
the
act
of
congress
or
in
any
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
d.
l.
case
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
l.
case
it
was
simplified
under
the
sinkler
case
that
the
other
railroad
was
the
agent
of
the
defendant.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes,
that's
correct
and
all
of
the
cases
historically
in
this
court
and
other
federal
courts.
it
definitely
established
that
the
word
employee
is
used
in
its
natural,
normal
and
ordinary
sense.
and
the
session
such
as
robinson
holding
the
foreman
porters
were
not
railroad
employees,
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
1939
amendment
and
if
congress
had
intended
to
extend
the
scope
and
coverage
of
the
act
to
persons
who
were
not
--
would
not
normally
be
considered
as
employees,
i
assume
that
it
could
have
done
so
and
would
have.
there's
certainly
no
basis
for
extending
it
as
i
can
see
it
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
d.
l.
case
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
d.
l.
case
linstead.
as
i
recall,
linstead
was
the
fellow
that
was
taking
a
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
oh
yes,
in
that
case,
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
they
were
doing
the
acts
--
they
had
loan
an
engine
and
caboose
and
crew
to
the
cno
as
i
understand
the
case
and
they
operating
under
the
rules
of
the
cno
and
under
the
supervision
of
their
superintendent.
mr.
d.
l.
case
lone
servant,
your
honor,
is
what
that
was.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes,
temporary
lone
to
the
other.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes,
that's
right.
as
a
lone
service,
as
i
understand
it.
my
time
is
up,
i'll
take
it,
your
honor.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
impose
on
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
--
your
time
to
a
case
which
--
in
which
i
understand
an
application
is
now
pending
in
this
court
which
has
not
been
cited
by
petitioner.
it's
a
case
of
byrne
against
pennsylvania
railroad
and
i
don't
have
the
official
citation,
i
have
only
a
copy,
photostatic
copy
of
the
opinion
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
d.
l.
case
a
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
b-y-r-n-e
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
--
against
pennsylvania
that
held
that
a
certain
person
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad
and
it
will
distinguish
it
by
saying
that
that
is
a
lone
servant
case
and
not
a
case
such
as
this.
i
do
not
have
the
official
citation.
mr.
d.
l.
case
it's
a
federal
case
that
was
--
mr.
d.
l.
case
--
the
opinion
was
december
the
16th,
1958
for
the
third
circuit.
mr.
d.
l.
case
yes.
thank
you,
your
honors.
