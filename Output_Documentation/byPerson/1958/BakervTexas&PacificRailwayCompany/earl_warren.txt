petitioners,
versus
(inaudible)
railroad
company.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
case
--
mr.
case,
before
you
get
into
the
law
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
you
mind
commenting
on
--
on
the
argument
of
counsel
to
the
effect
that
this
contractor
had
the
right
to
or
not
the
contractor
but
an
assistant
engineer
of
the
railroad
company
had
the
right
even
to
discharge
the
contractor
that
he
not
only
had
the
right
to
but
he
did
direct
to
both
the
contractor
and
his
work
in
the
manner
in
which
their
--
their
work
was
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all
of
those
other
things
that
are
--
are
in
there.
you
didn't
mention
those
in
your
statement
of
facts
and
i
--
i
think
it's
rather
important
to
be
considered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
doesn't
mean
the
whole
roadbed
in
that
vicinity
is
concrete
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
for
stabilizing
the
--
the
rails
--
ties.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
case,
may
i
--
may
just
ask
a
question
to
see
how
far
your
argument
goes?
suppose
we
change
the
facts
of
this
case
just
a
little.
as
i
--
as
i
understand
that
these
men
were
working
at
this
grouting
on
the
railroad
tracks
and
a
train
passed
and
through
the
negligence
of
somebody
injured
the
deceit
or
killed.
now,
suppose
that
instead
of
him
being
injured,
the
train
was
wrecked
and
the
train
crew
itself
was
--
was
injured
and
it
could
be
traced
directly
to
this
contractor,
the
negligence
that
caused
it.
would
the
railroad
be
liable
to
those
--
under
the
fela?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
if
it
is
--
if
it
is
a
non-delegable
responsibility
for
that
purpose,
why
wouldn't
it
be
for
this
other
--
that
--
i
just
want
to
get
the
distinction
between
the
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
maintenance
of
track
seems
to
be
such
a
fundamental
thing
that
i
would
imagine
if
anything
was
non-delegable,
it
would
be
keeping
the
roadbed
in
such
condition
position
that
it
could
be
traveled
with
safety.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
red
light
is
on.
the
white
is
five
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
was
the
petitioner's
name?
chief
justice
earl
warren
byrne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
a
federal
case
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
third
circuit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
your
statement.
that
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
one
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
