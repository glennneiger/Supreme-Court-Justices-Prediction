mr.
harvey
l.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
a
texas
court
of
civil
appeal.
there
are
two
basic
questions
involved
there.
the
first
is
whether
the
petitioners
were
denied
their
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
to
determine
whether
claude
baker,
the
deceased
husband
and
father
of
petitioners
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad,
the
respondent,
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
and
the
second
basic
question
is
whether
claude
baker
was
such
an
employee
of
the
railroad
as
a
matter
of
law.
these
are
the
pertinent
facts.
claude
baker
was
hired
and
he
was
paid
by
the
w.
h.
nichols
&
company
as
a
member
of
a
crew
to
do
a
type
of
maintenance
work
called
“grouting”
along
the
main
line
roadbed
of
the
texas
&
pacific
railroad.
he
was
killed
by
the
negligence
of
one
of
the
railroad
trainman
while
he
was
working
on
the
roadbed.
now,
this
maintenance
work
of
grouting
consists
of
pumping
into
the
roadbed
by
means
of
a
hydraulic
pump,
a
mixture
of
sand,
cement
and
water
to
fill
in
voids
under
the
roadbed
and
to
force
up
water
pockets
and
its
purpose
is
to
strengthen
and
to
stabilize
and
straighten
the
roadbed.
the
location
for
the
grouting
work
was
laid
up
by
the
engineering
department
of
the
railroad,
and
claude
baker's
job
was
to
handle
the
cement.
he
would
pour
cement
into
the
cement
mixture
and
other
employees
would
pour
the
sand
and
water
in
it.
baker
would
throw
the
cement
sacks
at
his
feet
and
occasionally
would
take
the
pile
across
the
railroad
tracks
to
be
disposed
of.
after
baker
was
killed,
his
widow
filed
for
compensation
insurance
under
the
laws
of
texas
and
was
awarded
a
compensation
award
of
some
$7000
--
almost
$8000,
i
believe
it
was.
then
her
attorneys
filed
a
common
law
suit
for
negligence
against
the
railroad.
however,
in
the
subsequent
investigation
of
the
suit,
facts
were
discovered
which
led
the
attorneys
to
the
belief
that
baker
was
in
fact
and
under
the
law
an
employee
of
the
railroad
and
therefore
the
pleadings
were
amended
to
allege
a
cause
of
action
against
the
railroad
under
the
act.
now,
the
theory
of
the
pleading
was
that
the
w.
h.
nichols
company
was
not
an
independent
contractor
but
was
under
the
law
and
in
fact
an
employee
or
an
agent
of
the
railroad
and
therefore
baker
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad
and
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
act.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
certainly.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
the
right
of
subrogation
is
allowed
to
the
insurance
company,
i
believe.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
we
don't
dispute
that
whatsoever.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no,
it
accepts
employees
of
railroads
though.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
and
the
only
effective
compensation
insurance
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
is
that
it
has
some
evidence
that
--
that
it
may
be
construed
as
some
evidence
that
nichols
was
not
an
independent
contractor.
however,
there
are
cases
directly
in
point
where
it
has
been
held
by
the
court
that
the
holding
of
compensation
insurance
by
such
a
contractor
indicates
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
evade
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
and
we
believe
that
fits
this
case
here.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
if
it's
on
common
law
negligence,
there's
no
question
that
there
is
a
right
of
subrogation
by
the
insurance
company.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
there
is
--
there
is
no
law
on
that
point,
your
honor.
we
don't
contest
it
--
we've
never
raised
any
contest
about
whether
the
insurance
company
may
or
may
not
get
it
back.
they
pled
intervention
and
we
did
not
answer
their
plea.
however,
the
respondents
did
answer
and
denied
that
they
had
the
right
to
get
it
back.
we
are
unable
to
see
whether
it
is
any
of
the
concern
of
the
respondent,
whether
the
insurance
company
gets
it
back
or
not.
it
is
their
liability
that
we
seek.
and
then
the
compensation
insurance
is
completely
irrelevant
to
the
liability
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no,
it
wouldn't
exclude
it.
but
now
in
this
case
--
i'll
answer
it
this
way.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
the
widow
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
legal
case
that
her
employee
under
the
law
was
an
employee
of
the
railway.
it
was
the
lawyers
who
determined
that
that
possibility
arose.
she
collected
the
compensation
insurance
believing
he
was
only
an
employee
of
the
nichols
company.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no
sir.
there
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no,
sir.
there
are
no
--
there
are
cases
directly
in
point
on
that
that
it
is
not
a
stopple.
further,
the
respondents
have
not
pled
that
as
a
defense
and
have
not
argued
except,
i
believe,
they
put
it
in
their
brief
in
this
final
brief.
we
discovered
during
the
investigation
of
the
case
that
the
respondent
through
its
inspector
slaton,
exercised
actual
control
and
have
the
right
to
control
almost
all
of
the
minute
details
of
the
work
of
baker
and
the
other
employees
of
nichols.
and
also,
in
considering
the
written
contract
between
nichols
and
the
railroad,
we
discovered
that
they
had
an
indemnity
clause,
the
effect
of
which
was
to
completely
exempt
the
railroad
from
any
liabilities
for
doing
this
maintenance
work.
and
therefore,
we
concluded
that
it
was
in
the
teeth
of
section
55
of
the
act
and
was
void.so
our
first
and
our
main
point
is
that
the
petitioners
were
deprived
of
their
right
of
a
jury
trial
because
of
the
substantial
evidence
that
was
introduced
in
the
trial
that
the
employee,
claude
baker,
of
the
nichols
company,
doing
maintenance
work
on
the
railroads
main
land
tracks
was
not
an
independent
contractor.
now,
the
test
to
determine
whether
the
nichols
company
was
an
independent
contractor
that
have
been
approved
by
this
honorable
court,
are
primarily
whether
the
railroad
have
the
control
or
the
right
to
control
the
details
of
the
work.
that
was
approved
in
the
bond
case
cited
on
page
19
of
our
brief.
now,
there's
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
workmen
were
told
to
obey
slaton
and
that
they
did
obey
him.
slaton
being
the
respondent's
inspector.
that
slaton
told
them
when
and
where
to
move
these
hydraulic
jacks
that
only
slaton
would
mark
the
points
where
the
hydraulic
jack
point
would
be
inserted
in
the
roadbed
for
pumping
the
grout
mixture.
that
slaton
told
them
how
to
mix
the
grout
mixture,
when
to
thicken
it,
when
to
thin
it
and
he
admonish
the
inattentiveness
of
the
men
if
they
allowed
the
grout
mixture
to
escape
from
the
roadbed
that
he
watch
to
see
that
they
didn't
put
too
much
grout
mixture
in
the
roadbed
so
as
to
hump
the
tracks
and
get
it
out
of
level
and
that
he
took
care
to
see
that
the
operation
of
the
grouting
work
did
not
interfere
with
the
trains.
now,
we
believe
that
the
jury
was
entitled
to
find
these
things
as
facts
to
show
that
the
railroad
through
slaton
exercised
actual
control
and
had
the
right
to
control
the
details
of
the
work.
but
the
trail
court
refused
to
submit
any
issues
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
the
jury
and
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
nichols
company
was
not
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no,
sir.
one
or
the
other.
and
in
that
regard,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
its
opinion
on
page
217
in
the
record
and
as
summarized
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
admitted
that
the
petitioners
exercise
actual
control
of
the
details
of
the
work
but
then
they
held
that
that
exercise
of
actual
control
was
quote
immaterial
and
then
they
disregard
at
all
the
evidence
that
we
had
introduced
about
the
right
of
the
railroad
to
control
the
details
of
work
and
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
railroad
did
not
have
the
right
of
control
relying
on
the
written
contract
alone
which
said
that
there
was
no
right
of
control
by
the
railroad.
this
proposition
of
law,
we
feel,
is
completely
unfounded
and
wrong
on
its
phase
and
there
is
no
case
in
the
books
that
says
actual
control
is
not
material
and
would
not
be
a
jury
issue.
they
cited
the
cimorelli
case
which
is
also
discussed
on
28
--
on
page
28
of
our
brief
as
authority
but
the
cimorelli
case
did
not
hold
that
or
mean
that
at
all.
the
cimorelli
case
held
that
if
the
railroad
had
the
right
of
control
of
the
details
of
the
work,
they
then
did
not
even
have
to
exercise
acts
of
control
for
the
contractor
to
be
held
not
independent.
throughout
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
they
violated
the
rule
laid
down
in
this
--
by
this
court
to
consider
only
the
evidence
favorable
to
the
petitioners
and
the
inferences
therefrom
and
determining
whether
there
is
jury
issue.
instead,
they
looked
at
the
evidence
favorable
to
respondent
and
the
inferences
therefrom
and
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
nichols
company
was
not
an
independent
contractor.
we
feel
that
there
is
no
question
that
there
was
a
jury
issue
and
on
that
point,
we
would
ask
that
this
case
be
remanded
for
a
jury
trial
of
the
issues
of
whether
nichols
was
an
independent
contractor.
however,
i
believe
also
that
there
are
enough
factors
in
this
case
where
this
court
can
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
nichols
was
not
an
independent
contractor.
we
be
--
believe
first
that
nichols
was
not
an
independent
contractor
because
this
maintenance
work
was
a
non-delegable
duty
of
the
railroad
to
perform
either
by
their
own
maintenance
man
or
by
others
but
it's
their
statutory
duty
by
the
federal
statute
and
the
state
statutes.
that
plus
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
this
contract
was
to
permit
the
railroad
to
have
this
work
perform
--
this
non-delegable
work
perform
with
complete
indemn
--
indemnity
to
it
and
therefore
exempt
itself
from
liabilities
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
there
is
direct
authority
for
that
proposition
in
the
case
--
in
the
erie
case
cited
on
page
41
of
our
brief.
now,
the
texas
court
opinion
on
that
point
attempts
to
do
a
way
with
the
argument
by
labeling
the
maintenance
work
as
special
or
extraordinary
using
the
terms
of
the
witnesses
for
the
respondent.
however,
the
only
case
they
cite
for
that
is
the
norman
case
cited
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
and
in
the
norman
case,
every
issue,
that
was
--
that
is
involved
in
this
case
was
stipulated
in
favor
of
the
railroad
by
count.
for
instance,
in
the
norman
case,
they
stipulated
that
the
contractor
involved
in
that
case
was
really
an
independent
contractor.
they
stipulated
that
the
contract
was
in
fact
not
made
to
evade
or
exempt
the
railroad
from
the
liabilities
of
the
act
and
they
also
stipulated
that
the
1939
amendment
to
the
act
should
not
be
considered
with
reference
to
determining
who
were
employees
of
the
railroad.
we
submit
that
the
use
of
the
adjectives,
special
or
extraordinary,
cannot
possibly
change
the
fact
that
this
was
maintenance
work
imposed
upon
the
railroad
by
statute
as
a
matter
of
law
as
a
duty
not
to
our
deceased
but
to
the
public
that
they
had
to
maintain
it
and
calling
it
special
grouting
work
or
extraordinary
work
doesn't
change
it.
it
was
maintenance
work.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
it
had
to
be
done
either
by
grouting
or
by
some
other
means
to
strengthen
and
stabilize
and
keep
the
railroad
tracks
straight.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
grouting
is
the
pumping
of
this
cement
mixture
under
pressure
into
the
roadbed.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
well,
mr.
justice
clark,
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
--
with
all
the
working
aspects
but
if
you
see
a
cement
mixture
alongside
of
the
track
with
common
laborers
inserting
these
things
in
the
track
under
the
directions
of
the
--
of
the
railroad
maintenance
employees,
it
probably
is
grouting.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
but
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
in
machine.
now
these
machines,
hydraulic
mudjacks
are
ordinary
machines
used
in
highway
construction.
there's
nothing
special
about
them.
it
doesn't
require
any
skill
to
operate
them.
all
of
which
we
believe
indicates
that
they
could
have
had
this
maintenance
work
done
by
their
own
employees
at
the
chores.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
there
is
any
skill
was
the
pattern
for
the
placing
of
the
points
and
these
were
laid
out
in
the
engineering
department
of
the
railroad
and
also
inspector
slaton
marked
these
points
for
the
man
to
insert
the
hydraulic
pressure.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no
i
don't
believe
we
have
any
cases.
there
are
some
--
there
are
some
other
state
courts
that
have
held
that
they
are
non-delegable
and
there
is
--
there
are
two
federal
cases
that
have
held
precisely
that
they're
non-delegable.
the
--
one
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
--
of
them
is
the
mark
case.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
i
--
i
don't
know.
now,
on
that
point,
the
respondents
in
their
brief
say
that
the
record
shows
they
never
have
done
it
and
that
they
always
know
other
railroad
driver
have
done.
however,
the
reference
in
record
that
is
made
is
about
two
pages
of
testimony
dealing
with
pole
driving
rather
than
grouting
and
all
of
their
statements
about
the
history
of
grouting
really
referred
to
pole
driving.
there
has
been
an
error
on
the
exact
testimony
there.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no.
no,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
their
statutory
duty
to
see
that
it
is
performed.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
that
plus
the
fact
that
they
cannot
exempt
themselves
from
liabilities
for
having
it
done
by
immunity-indemnity
such
as
they've
tried
to
do
here.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
under
the
authority
of
the
hubert
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
well,
the
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
i
don't
--
i
don't
claim
or
say
that
they
may
have
had
the
actually
intent
to
exempt
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no,
i
believe
that
if
it's
a
necessary
operation
and
practical
effect
to
that.
i
think
that
what
he
hubert
case
says,
we
quote
the
language
in
the
hubert
case
which
says
that
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
the
part
that
provide
for
the
employees
of
the
railroad
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no,
the
only
evidence
was
the
testimony
of
respondent
and
witnesses
that
they
didn't
--
it
was
--
they
didn't
make
the
contract
to
--
to
get
around
the
act.
we
don't
have
any
evidence
as
to
what
their
actual
intent
was
but
the
combination
of
the
non-delegable
duty
being
performed
over
contract
where
the
railroad
can
have
no
liability
whatsoever
for
their
maintenance
work
that
they
have
to
do.
the
necessary
and
practical
effect
of
the
contract
is
to
exempt
them
from
any
liabilities
under
the
act.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
well,
no.
i
believe
if
this
court
says
and
hold
that
this
is
non-delegable
work
and
that
the
effect
of
the
--
of
the
contract
is
to
completely
indemnify
the
railroad
and
the
performance
of
that
work.
and
section
51
also
says
that
they
are
to
perform
it
that
it
could
be
held
so.
however,
i
would
like
to
approach
--
give
another
approach
as
to
the
possibility
of
holding
the
nichols
company,
an
independent
contractor
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
is
on
the
analogy
of
the
sinkler
case
decided
in
this
court
last
year.
baker
was
doing
the
railroad
work
here
as
part
of
the
unitary
enterprise
and
he
was
exposed
to
all
of
its
inherent
danger
just
as
other
maintenance
workers
were.
and
therefore
we
believe
he
should
be
classified
as
an
employee
of
the
railroad
under
the
act.
now,
in
the
sinkler
case,
you
consider
the
accommodating
scope
of
the
word
agent.
here,
we
think
you
should
consider
the
accommodating
scope
of
the
word
employee.
in
the
sinkler,
the
railroad
was
held
liable
for
the
negligence
of
a
truly
independent
contractor
because
that
independent
contractor
was
engaged
with
them
in
a
common
enterprise.
here,
nichols
and
baker
and
the
other
employees
were
engaged
in
the
railroad
in
a
common
enterprise,
maintenance
work.
and
in
this
case,
it
is
the
railroad
itself
who
is
negligent.
in
the
sinkler
case,
it
was
the
independent
contractor
who
was
negligent.
and
further
in
this
case,
the
railroad
maintained
the
control
and
the
right
to
control
these
workers.
that
was
not
done
the
in
the
sinkler
case.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right,
your
honor.
no
question
that
he
--
but
he
was
an
employee.
but
the
question
was,
was
this
independent
contractor
an
agent
of
the
railroad?
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
i
think
that
theory
is
sound
and
i
think
it's
just
as
sound
to
say
that
because
he
was
doing
this
maintenance
work,
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
rest
of
the
employees
of
the
railroad
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
act,
he
should
be
considered
an
employee
also.
we
believe
that
the
movement
of
the
trains
and
maintenance
work
are
equally
as
much
the
railroad
work.
therefore,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
point
out
these
factors
whereby
this
court
may
hold
that
baker
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
was
doing
the
railroad
work.
he
was
exposed
to
all
of
the
inherent
risk
of
a
railroad
worker.
he
was
doing
a
part
of
the
railroad
unitary
enterprise.
the
work
was
a
franchise
obligation.
it
was
non-delegable.
they
had
to
have
it
done.
the
necessary
operation
and
effect
of
the
contract
between
nichols
and
the
company
was
to
exempt
the
railroad
of
some
of
its
obligations
under
that
and
the
details
of
the
act
were
actually
controlled
by
the
railroad
--
details
of
the
work,
pardon
me.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
well,
that's
our
--
that's
our
main
and
first
argument.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes,
that's
our
first
argument.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
that's
right.
however,
we
are
also
urging
that
he
is
an
employee
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
no
the
act
--
the
act
says
he
should
be
an
employee.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
well,
agent
would
do
but
we
believe
being
a
common
labor
that
employee
best
fits
his
category.
the
nichols
company
might
be
contained
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
probably
the
byrne
case
opinion
being
officially
reported
may
be
waiting
on
the
court's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
the
bond
case
on
the
--
on
our
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
yes,
the
bond
case,
the
issue
of
a
jury
whether
there
was
evidence
for
a
jury
trial
was
not
at
all
involved,
that's
our
main
point
here
that
there
was
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
that
was
involved
in
the
--
in
the
bond
case.
now,
in
the
bond
case,
the
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
control
or
right
to
control
and
that
the
operations
of
bond
could
be
performed
without
being
involved
with
the
railroad's
operation.
in
this
case,
it
is
completely
different.
part
of
my
argument
about
the
non-delegable
duty
is
the
fact
that
the
operation
here,
the
maintenance
of
track
is
so
interwoven
with
the
railroad's
operation
that
the
--
that
the
railroad
as
of
necessity
has
to
have
the
right
to
control
the
detail
of
the
work
of
these
--
of
these
men.
it's
so
intimate
with
their
own
statutory
obligation.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
right.
now,
counsel
for
respondent
has
picked
up
the
evidence
favorable
to
them
and
said
that
there
was
no
right
of
control.
however,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
question
that
there
is
sufficient
substantive
evidence
here
or
an
inference
is
there
from
whereby
the
issues
to
the
jury
--
issues
should
have
gone
to
the
jury
to
let
them
decide
whether
there
was
any
control
or
right
to
control.
and
also,
as
far
as
the
exercise
of
actual
control,
we
don't
say
that
that
is
the
prime
and
most
important
element
but
we
do
say
that
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
of
actual
control
whereby
the
jury
could
have
found
as
a
fact
that
there
was
actual
control
and
that
is
part
of
the
--
of
the
element
of
--
of
independent
contract.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
pardon?
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
the
work
had
to
be
done
on
the
railroad
property,
on
their
main
line
roadbed.
it
was
maintenance
work
that
had
to
be
done
there
and
it
had
to
be
done
by
the
railroad
by
the
statue.
and
i
don't
believe
there
can
be
any
distinction
historically
or
otherwise
between
the
operation
of
the
railroad
and
this
maintenance
work.
and
there
are
four
or
five
cases
directly
in
point
where
the
courts
have
held.
in
cimorelli,
barlion,
roth,
(inaudible)
and
mark
cases
all
have
held
that
these
so-called
independent
contractor
employees
were
employees
of
the
--
of
the
railroad.
two
of
those
cases
were
maintenance
cases.
and
the
dougall
case
cited
by
counsel
relied
again
on
that
norman
case
where
all
the
issues
in
favor
of
the
railroad
were
stipulated
by
the
parties.
we
also
requested
an
issue
on
comparative
negligence
in
this
case
in
the
trial
but
the
court
refused
to
submit.
the
court
in
fact
kept
every
aspect
of
the
federal
act
from
the
jury
and
--
my
time
is
up.
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
well
--
mr.
harvey
l.
davis
i
--
i
was
just
going
to
start
on
something
new.
so
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
