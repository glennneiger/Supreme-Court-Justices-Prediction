justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
would
be
the
situation
if
you
did
have
a
recovery
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act?
as
i
understand
workmen's
compensation
was
almost
$8000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
happens
to
that
$8000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
even
to
an
award
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
using
non-delegable
in
the
sense
that
it's
unlawful
for
them
the
contract
out
the
billing
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
it's
performed
by
an
independent
contractor
and
some
third
party
is
injured,
it's
no
defense
that
it
was
done
by
an
independent
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
that
--
that
requires
a
finding
--
is
that
under
section
55?
that
it
was
done
with
the
purpose
and
intent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
avoiding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
on
this
record
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
should
conclude
that
this
--
that
this
contracting
was
done
with
the
purpose
and
intent
of
avoiding
obligations
of
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
very
different.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
is
there
in
this
record
to
support
--
perhaps
you're
right
that
it
may
support
a
jury
finding
that
it
was
done
on
that,
right?
but
what
is
there
to
support
a
finding
that
that
was
the
reason
this
contract
was
--
was
entered
into
to
avoid
obligation
on
the
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
they
have
to
under
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
the
wording
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apart
from
your
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
that
depend
or
would
that
depend
on
the
extent
to
which
it
was
done.
for
example,
notwithstanding
the
language
of
this
--
of
the
agreement
between
the
railroad
and
the
contractor
if
in
fact
all
the
directions
of
the
method
and
manner
of
doing
the
work
in
terms
of
an
ordinary
foreman
employed
by
nichols
would
provide
that
direction,
were
provided
by
some
railroad
employee.
i
don't
suppose
it
at
least
be
a
question
of
such
control
that
a
jury
might
find
the
petitioner
here
was
an
employee
of
the
railroad.
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
this
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
it
could
be,
could
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
part
from
that
even
if
it
were
not,
even
for
another
door.
they
entered
into
the
contract
and
then
whatever
may
be
the
circumstance,
the
actual
direction
and
control
of
the
manner
of
doing
the
work
is
assumed
by
a
railroad
employee
rather
than
by
a
nichols
foreman
or
supervisor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
have
a
bearing
on
the
--
on
the
fact
question
whether
he
was
or
was
not
an
employee
of
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
why
it
has
to
be
a
sham.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however,
your
formula
--
formulate
the
way
you
say
it.
now
wouldn't
there
be
a
fact
question
than
in
any
event
under
the
standard
for
determining
employment
relationship
which
this
court
said
down
in
robinson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
what
you
say
this
record
shows
that
in
any
event,
if
any
railroad
employee
had
anything
to
do
with
directing
how
this
grouting
was
to
be
done,
that
was
true
only
in
isolated
instances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
i
though
--
did
the
jury
find
here
those
negligence
of
the
railroad
and
negligence
of
the
deceased.
and
you
don't
question
those
findings
here,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
the
only
issue
before
us
is
whether
he
was
an
employee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he
was
then
i
gather
he'd
be
what,
entitled
to
restatement
of
this
verdict,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
he
was
--
as
far
as
there's
a
basis
upon
which
a
legally
finding
may
be
sustained
of
employment
and
then
there's
no
issue
of
negligence
or
his
negligence
or
the
railroad's
negligence
to
be
litigated
again,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
--
on
the
issues
of
negligence
also?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
state
procedure.
