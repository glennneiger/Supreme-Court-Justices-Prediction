which
part
of
section

you
relying
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
duty
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
to
take
care
of
his
car
and
engines,
appliances,
machinery,
truck,
roadbed,
works
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.

that
was
in
the
evidence,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
is
not
an
employee,
what
would
you
say
about
any
other
words
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
an
officer,
agent
or
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
doing
something
for
them
that
the
statute
requires
them
to
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
arguing
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
it
would
bother
you.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
use
your
time
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
precisely
how
you
find
from
this
record
this
man
was
injured
and
what
caused
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
man
here
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
about
his
injury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
do
you
understand
is
the
evidence
--
could
be
found
from
the
evidence
was
the
plaintiff's
version
of
what
caused
him
to
be
hurt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
in
connection
with
the
way
the
track
was
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
there's
any
more
responsibility
on
the
railroad
to
operate
its
trains
under
the
act
than
there
is
to
maintain
its
right
of
way
and
tracks
in
good
condition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
about
the
maintenance
of
its
train?
what
distinction
do
you
draw
the
act
provide
for
the
negligence
of
the
employees
in
operating
and
so
forth
and
provides
for
the
liability
of
the
company
of
negligence,
keeping
its
engines,
appliances,
tracks
and
so
forth.
how
can
you
draw
a
distinction
and
say
that
independent
contractors
and
employees
--
with
the
employees
of
the
railroad
operating
the
train
but
would
not
be
employees
of
the
railroad
or
agents
of
the
railroad
for
maintaining
the
tracks?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
act
--
the
act
itself
controls,
i
suppose,
it
wouldn't
be
governed
by
history
or
unless
it
is
governed
by
history,
what
distinction
can
you
draw
between
saying
that
the
employee
of
the
independent
contractor
operating
the
train,
an
employee
of
the
railroad,
an
employee
of
an
independent
contractor
keeping
up
the
tracks
as
the
law
requires,
is
it
not?
i'm
not
talking
about
this
section
55
