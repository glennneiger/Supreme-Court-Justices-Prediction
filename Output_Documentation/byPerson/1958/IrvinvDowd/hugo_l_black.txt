was
he
challenged?
justice

where
is
that?

that
was
the

ruling.

36
to
58.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
state
contend
that
you
could
now
raise
this
question
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
admitted
that
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
no
remedy
in
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far,
whenever
it
is
waived,
you
have
exhausted
the
possibility
of
getting
a
remedy
in
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
question
whether
if
there
has
been
assumed
to
be
a
violation
of
due
process,
you
can
get
a
remedy
in
the
federal
court
even
though
the
state
will
not
give
it
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
not
consider
them
because
he
was
an
escapee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
i
understand
that
the
argument
is
that
the
state,
you
have
forfeited
--
he
forfeited
his
right
by
escaping.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
his
rights
to
appeal,
and
that
the
state
therefore
will
give
him
no
remedy
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
did
escape.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
he
has
exhausted
his
remedies
and
that
the
federal
court
should
not
deny
him
relief
if
there's
an
unconstitutional
--
if
he
has
been
on
the
constitutional
--
deprive
of
his
life
of
liberty
on
the
ground
that
he
is
an
escapee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
the
state
does,
that's
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
when
he
started
making
the
allegations
of
--
on
the
constitution
of
conviction
that
he
did,
he
had
alleged
that
there
was
mob
domination
of
the
trial.
that
was
in
the
record
that
was
shown
by
the
record
to
some
extent
and
the
court
refused
to
consider
it
on
the
ground
that
he
was
an
escapee.
would
that
be
an
adequate
state
ground
so
that
the
federal
court
could
not
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
thing
is
here
except
that
the
he
alleges
mob
domination,
trial
under
mob
domination.
justice

in

--
justice

black
and
--
and
he
couldn't
do
it
because
he
escaped.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
say
about
moore
versus
dempsey
on
that
regard?
moore
versus
dempsey
was
the
case
in
which
the
state
refused
to
consider
this
ground
alleged
on
the
constitutionality
on
the
ground
that
it
came
too
late.
it
was
insisted
that
that
was
inadequate

a
denial
of

opinion,
mr.

mr.
justice

tell
that
that
was
not
true,
that
he
could
raise
this
constitutional
question
even
though
the
state
ruled,
did
say
he
couldn't.
what's
the
difference
in
principle
between
that
case
and
this
one?
justice

both

depravation
of

and
the
other
is
the
series
of

justice

in
each
instance,
the

they

they

the
federal

there
was
an
adequate

it
was

here,
you
say
that
federal

cannot
consider
this
because
as
to

disposed

if
moore
versus
dempsey
was
right,
how
can
you
defend
your
position
here?
justice

what
the
--
what
the
state
said
was
there,
that
in
substance,
it
would
be
absent
of
the
sufficient
directive
process
afforded
by
the

courts.
the

held
under

death
sentence.
said
--
that
fact
showing
a
conviction
resulted
from
a
trial
denying

process.
the
court
said
that
that
could
be
raised
in
a
federal
court
even
though
state
court
refused
to
do
it
because
the
appeal
was
too
late.
justice
hugo

but
what
he
--
what
the
situation
as
leslie
irvin
is
that
he
alleges
that
his
life
is
about
to
be
taken.
justice
hugo
l.

--
under
a
conviction
which
was
rendered
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
and
if
that
situation,
you
--
under
the
federal
constitution,
because
that
situation,
you
have
to
make.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
the
fact
that
he
was
not
there,
the
state
had
a
rule,
they
wouldn't
consider
his
appeal,
means
that
he
has
forfeited
his
right
to
have
his
federal
constitutional
rights
protected
in
the
federal
courts.

what's

the

it's
that
about

they've
done

in

even

they'd
gone
