justice

mr.
lockyear,
as
justice
harlan
suggests
and
--
and
without
any
intent
on
my
part
to
interfere
with
your
argument.
i
hope
you
are
trying
to
address
yourself
before
you're
finished
to
the
--
to
the
important
preliminary
question
here.
the
fact
is
that
the
federal
district
court
and
a
unanimous
unites
states
court
of
appeals
including
chief
judge
duffy,
whom
you
quoted,
squarely
held
that
this
man
had
not
exhausted
his
state
remedies
and
that
therefore,
the
district
--
the
federal
courts
were
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
writ.
now,
and
they
did
so
by
referring
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
which
said
that
since
the
appellant
had
no
standing
in
court
at
the
time
he
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
situation
is
the
same
as
if
no
motion
for
a
new
trial
had
been
filed,
or
he
had
voluntarily
permitted
the
time
to
expire
for
such
filing,
and
i'm
now
quoting
under
the
supreme
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
court
of
indiana.
that
quite
before
--
ahead
of
the
merits
which
you've
been
discussing.
it
is
--
is
certainly
the
--
the
basis
of
the
decisions
below
both
--
as
i
say,
by
the
district
court
and
the
unanimous
court
of
appeals,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
even
judge
duffy
who
--
even
judge
duffy
who
agreed
with
you
that
this
man's
constitutional
rights
had
been
impaired
still
said
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
it
because
he
did
not
exhaust
his
state

state

justice

he
did,
but
didn't
he
also
squarely
hold
--
justice

--
and
not
exhaust
his
state
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
my
--
my
only
request
to
you
is
that
you
address
yourself
to
that
threshold
question
sometime
before
you
complete
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
there
had
never
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
motion
for
a
new
trial,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
givan,
then
--
then
you
have
no
case
but
you
certainly
have
the
indiana
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
didn't
that
court
view
the
question
as
you
suggest
as
one
of
--
as
one
standing,
one
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i'm
reading,
i
think
i
assume
a
direct
quotation
from
the
opinion
of
the
indiana
supreme
court.
they
said,
“cynthia
talbot
had
no
standing
in
court
at
the
time
he
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.”
the
situation
is
the
same
as
if
no
motion
for
a
new
trial
had
been
filed
or
he
had
voluntarily
permitted
the
time
to
expire
for
such
filling.
now,
by
equating
the
petitioners
absence
with
having
escaped
--
with
voluntarily
having
permitted
the
time
to
expire
for
such
filing,
doesn't
the
indiana
supreme
court
itself
bring
this
case
very
close
to
moore
against
dempsey?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
to
the
effect
of
this
man
having
escaped.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

then
you
put
him
in
the
same
position.
justice
potter
stewart
as
though
he
left
--
left
the
time.
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
you
do
know
is
what
the
indiana
supreme
court
held
to
be
the
law
of
indiana
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
these
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
telling
us
you
don't
know
what
they
would
have
held
if
the
law
of
indiana
came
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
the
supposititious
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
also
a
motion
for
a
continuance
of
this
refusal,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
givan,
just
before
you
sit
down
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
--
do
you
agree
with
mr.
lockyear
as
to
--
on
the
preliminary
question
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
that
there
is
now
no
remedy
available
in
the
state
of
indiana?
justice
potter
stewart
no
possibility
of
reviewing
the
fairness
of
this
trial
by
the
state
of
indiana
at
this
time.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
did
not
the
court
accept
into
evidence
the
letter
written
to
mr.
lockyear
by
the
--
by
the
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
letter
somehow
incorporated
with
the
order
or
perhaps
not,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
lopp,
do
we
have
in
the
record
here
the
briefs
of
the
parties
eventually
filed
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
brief
of
the
state,
did
it
take
the
position
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
trial
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it
refers
to
me
that
maybe
in
your
state
practice,
it's
not
necessary
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss,
maybe
the
argument
on
the
appeal
was
just
that
this
motion
was
properly
denied
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
could
