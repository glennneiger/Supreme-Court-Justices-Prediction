mr.
richard
m.
givan
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
before
i
start
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
again
remind
the
court
that
mr.
paul
weaver,
who
was
a
prosecuting
attorney
of
vanderburgh
county
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
leslie
irvin,
is
in
the
court.
now,
the
reason
for
his
presence
here
is
because
of
the
nature
of
personal
attack
levied
against
him
and
because
of
the
statements
made
by
chief
judge
duffy
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
mr.
weaver
requested
that
he
be
permitted
to
come
with
us
and
talk
to
us
concerning
the
handling
of
this
case
in
this
court,
although
it
is
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
of
indiana
to
handle
the
case.
mr.
weaver
made
that
request
which
mr.
steers,
the
attorney
general
of
indiana
granted
because
of
the
nature
of
the
personal
attack
against
mr.
weaver.
he
is
here
and
i
realized
it's
highly
irregular,
but
if
the
court
feel
that
they
have
questions
they
would
like
to
address
mr.
weaver
while
he
welcomes
those
questions,
he
would
love
--
he
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
answering
questions
the
court
might
have
to
direct
to
him,
although
he
does
not
anticipate
making
any
part
of
the
argument.
i
would
like
first
to
address
my
argument
to
this
matter
of
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedy.
we
of
course
have
the
basic
case
brown
versus
allen
that
a
petitioner
must
have
exhausted
the
available
state
remedies
before
he
is
permitted
to
go
into
the
federal
courts.
that
case
of
course
is
supported
by
statute
dated
28
u.s.c.
section
2254
which
sets
out
that
prerequisite.
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
we
have
the
case
of
united
states
ex
rel.
touhy
versus
ragen
decided
in
1955
by
chief
judge
duffy,
as
chief
judge
duffy
wrote
the
deciding
opinion
in
that
case.
and
that
statement
was
again
reiterated
by
the
court
at
the
--
and
remedies
must
be
exhausted.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
here,
i
believe
chief
--
or
justice
--
one
of
the
justice,
i
can't
recall
which
one.
one
of
the
justices
through
this
bench
addressed
a
question
to
mr.
lockyear
concerning
the
--
whether
or
not
the
remedies
had
been
exhausted.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
remedies
have
not
been
to
this
day
exhausted.
the
mere
fact
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
does
not,
your
honor.
because
as
was
held
by
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
maybe
waved,
that
is
the
question.
it
is
--
it's
either
been
exercised,
it
exists
today,
or
it
has
been
waived
in
the
past.
in
all
three
situations,
you
come
up
with
the
same
answer.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
i
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
is
a
waiver
in
this
case.
the
remedy
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
of
the
escape,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
that
is
not
a
statute.
it
is
a
rule
of
our
court
following
this
court.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
will,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
let
us
start
with
the
presumption,
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
leslie
irvin
was
denied
due
process
of
law
in
the
trial
court.
at
that
time,
the
state
of
indiana
afforded
an
adequate
remedy
if
that
were
the
situation.
he
had,
from
the
rendering
of
the
verdict
of
guilty
by
the
jury.
30
days
within
which
to
address
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
the
trial
court
setting
out
the
specifications
assigned
--
assigned
for
new
trial.
the
petitioner
then
following
30
days,
he
--
let's
assume
that
he
would
file
such
a
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
did,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
yes
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
escaped.
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
if
i
may
take
this,
the
hypothetical
and
--
and
carry
through
that
he
would
file
his
motion
for
new
trial
30
days,
the
court
would
rule
on
that
motion.
let's
assume
not
the
irvin
case
but
a
case
that
was
--
where
they
--
there's
no
question
about
filing
a
motion
for
new
trial
within
the
time,
to
file
his
motion
30
days.
he
then
has
90
days
within
which
to
file
a
transcript
in
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
then
would
consider
his
appeal
based
upon
an
assignment
of
error
which
act
as
a
complaint
in
our
court
on
appeal.
the
assignment
of
error,
one
of
those
things
which
may
be
assigned
is
the
ruling
of
the
court
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
now,
that
was
the
situation
--
that
situation
would
afford
a
remedy
in
indiana
to
any
person
convicted
as
leslie
irvin
was.
now,
let
us
examine
the
facts
to
see
why
the
state
maintains
that
leslie
irvin
did
not
afford
himself
of
that
remedy.
the
conviction
or
the
verdict
of
the
jury
was
rendered
on
the
19th
day
or
the
20th
day
of
december
of
1955.
the
last
day
for
the
filing,
as
had
been
pointed
out
here,
where
--
of
a
motion
for
new
trial
was
on
the
19th
day
of
january
1956.
on
the
18th
day
of
january
1956,
leslie
irvin
escaped,
and
i
insist
on
using
those
words
if
i
may
digress
for
a
moment
here
and
--
and
that
time.
there,
the
time
element
was
regulated
by
snowfall
which
--
and
there
were
no
tracks
and
so
the
time
was
fairly
well
fixed
as
before
midnight.
leslie
irvin
manufactured,
if
you
please,
a
key
from
cardboard
and
so
forth
and
--
and
opened
the
locks
of
the
jail
door.
now,
about
that,
i
--
i
realized
it's
outside
of
the
record,
but
if
i
may
say
it
to
explain
the
language
of
his
letter
that
his
--
his
letter
in
stating
that
he
had
done
the
wrong
thing
and
he
would
return
was
a
letter
written
advisedly
knowing
that
everyone
concerned
was
well
aware
of
the
factual
situation
concerning
his
escape
and
his
absence
in
the
court.
now,
the
question
was
raised,
“is
the
letter
the
only
evidence
of
his
escape?”
we
say
that
the
letter
is
not
the
only
evidence
to
--
it's
in
--
in
this
record.
it
is
not
the
only
evidence,
your
honor.
the
sheriff
of
the
court
who
had
charged
of
the
man
and
who
is
an
arm
of
the
court
and
a
duty
to
inform
the
court
of
the
goings
on
concerning
the
custody
of
the
prisoners,
did
in
open
court
and
it
is
in
the
record,
informed
the
judge
on
the
two
occasions
that
the
defendant
was
absent
and
that
he
had
escaped
from
the
jail,
his
whereabouts
were
unknown.
now,
leslie
irvin
therefore
escaped
on
the
18th
of
january.
on
the
morning
of
the
19th
of
january,
his
attorney's
appeared
in
court
to
present
the
motion
for
new
trial.
simultaneously,
the
sheriff
appeared
in
court
and
informed
the
court
the
defendant
was
gone.
the
attorneys,
nevertheless,
filed
the
motion
for
new
trial.
now,
they
say
that
no
question
was
raised
concerning
their
ability
to
do
that,
that
it
was
not
objected
to,
they
had
no
right.
i'd
like
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
the
time
had
not
yet
expired.
this
was
the
last
day,
but
it
was
early
in
the
last
day.
it's
presumed
--
presumed
i
--
i
believe
that
if
leslie
irvin
hadn't
shown
up
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
and
being
presented
in
court
sometime
that
day,
that
he
would
have
been
before
the
court
and
would
have
had
a
proper
motion
before
the
court.
so
the
court
i
think
rightly
entertained
the
motion
and
took
it
under
advisement
at
the
time
it
was
filed.
now,
later
on
the
23rd
of
january,
the
court
again
took
the
matter
up,
again
the
sheriff
came
in
and
advised
that
this
man
was
not
yet
in
custody.
he
was
still
at
large.
at
that
time,
the
letter
which
we
have
just
discussed
was
put
in
the
record.
and
there
upon,
the
court
overruled
the
motion
for
new
trial.
now,
and
we
take
the
position
that
that
was
all
he
could
do
under
the
circumstances,
under
the
authority
as
indiana
has
two
old
cases
on
it
and
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
at
page
11,
sutherland
versus
state
and
sargent
versus
state.
and
incidentally,
sargent
versus
state
is
quoted
in
allen
versus
georgia
by
this
court,
quoted
with
approval
to
the
proposition
that
a
person
--
while
an
escapee
has
no
standing
in
court.
now,
later,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
in
california,
was
returned
to
the
state
of
indiana
and
started
his
time
or
--
well,
he
didn't
start
time,
this
is
a
death
sentence.
he
was
incarcerated
way
out
to
a
week,
the
death
sentence
in
the
indiana
state
prison.
within
time,
the
attorney
as
concerning
and
considering
the
extensions
of
time
which
were
granted
by
the
court.
the
attorneys
for
leslie
irvin
filed
their
record
in
the
court.
now,
it
is
true
that
still
no
objection
to
their
so
filing
of
the
record
was
made
by
the
state
of
indiana.
they
were
permitted
to
file
that
record
and
address
a
brief
to
that
record
to
the
court.
we,
in
turn
after
an
extension
of
time
which
i
think
is
quite
understandable,
even
of
the
voluminous
nature
of
his
brief,
filed
our
own
brief.
and
the
first
proposition
which
we
set
forth
in
the
brief
is
for
his
proposition
which
we
must
consider
here.
did
leslie
irvin
file
a
proper
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
assignment
of
error.
the
only
assignment
of
error
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
was
the
ruling
of
the
court
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
we
took
the
position
that
the
court
ruled
properly
in
overruling
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
because
leslie
irvin
was
not
before
the
court.
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
there
had
never
been.
no,
sir.
we
felt
that
at
that
time
it
was
filed
that
no
one
knew
whether
leslie
irvin
would
be
back
in
court
before
the
time
it
expired
and
of
course
there
is
a
--
may
be
a
hazy
feel
whether
--
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
says
irony
on
the
matter
as
to
where
--
if
he
had
been
returned
afterwards
but
before
the
court
ruled
on
it,
and
was
brought
before
the
court
because
it
was
filed.
and
that
--
that's
a
question
that
we
don't
need
to
deal
with
here,
but
it
was
a
question
that
we
were
faced
with
at
that
time
as
to
whether
we
would
address
a
dilatory
motion
to
it.
and
due
to
the
severity
of
the
punishment
here,
we
felt
that
every
opportunity
should
be
given
to
be
heard
as
because
it
went
along.
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
that
we
have
the
same
factual
situation
concerning
the
filing
of
motion
for
new
trial
but
we'd
--
we
had
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
think
it
is
all
the
same,
your
honor
that
he
must
have
exhausted
the
state
remedy
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
that
he
had
to
this
mob
trial
that
he
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
i'm
not
prepared
to
state
an
actual
difference
in
principle
with
the
two
cases.
i
can
only
state
the
proposition
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i'm
not
prepared
really
to
--
to
compare
the
two
cases
and
such
i'm
not
fairly
conversant
with
the
--
in
the
factual
situation
you
have
stated,
your
honor.
that
in
the
moore
versus
dempsey
case
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
if
that
is
the
true
holding
in
your
court,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
take
issue
with
it
because
i
don't
think
that
is
the
true
state
of
the
law.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
have
the
case
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
have
the
later
case
also,
your
honor,
of
mitchell
versus
louisiana.
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
discuss
the
mitchell
case
in
which
mr.
justice
black,
he
dissented
believe.
in
--
in
mitchell
versus
louisiana,
we
had
a
situation
of
escape
and
a
waiver
(inaudible)
and
mr.
justice
douglas
also
dissented
and
mr.
chief
justice
warren
i
believe
concurred
without
opinion
in
that
--
in
those
dissents.
but
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
was
in
a
escape
actually
before
arraignment,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
wish
to
make
here
that
in
--
i
feel
in
the
mitchell
case
which
was
decided
in
1955
that
this
court
clearly
stated
that
the
man
having
escaped
and
--
that
he
had
no
standing
in
court.
and
the
--
there,
the
dissenting
opinions
were
grounded
i
believe
on
the
fact
that
the
man
had
escaped
or
hadn't
escaped
really,
he
had
fled
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
before
arraignment
and
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
grand
jury.
this
was
a
question
of
challenging
the
grand
jury,
had
--
never
had
the
opportunity
to
challenge
the
grand
jury.
and
he
then
later
was
arrested
and
returned
to
louisiana
and
they
claimed
he
was
too
late
to
challenge
the
grand
jury.
there
again,
the
question
of
whether
the
state
remedy
came
too
late.
and
the
dissenting
justices
held
that
he
was
--
had
never
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
that
question
because
he
had
not
been
taken
in
custody
and
that
there
was
a
good
likelihood
that
he
had
--
did
not
know
that
he
was
charged
by
this
grand
jury
until
he
was
brought
into
custody
and
it
was
too
late.
we
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
very
different
situation
in
the
irvin
case
here
that
leslie
irvin
was
before
the
court,
was
represented
by
a
competent
counsel
at
the
trial,
consulted
with
a
competent
counsel
that
they
did
attempt
to
afford
him
every
remedy.
and
it
was
leslie
irvin
who
by
his
own
act
chose
to
remove
himself
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
it
has
under
brown
versus
allen
in
1953,
this
court
held
that
and
it
is
held
that
not
only
the
remedy
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
exhaustion
of
remedy.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
could
have
it.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
maybe
i
should
back
up
and
get
back
to
the
habeas
corpus
remedy.
what
is
the
habeas
corpus
remedy?
i
think
this
court
and
the
indiana
courts
have
long
held,
and
i
think
without
any
dispute
that
the
habeas
corpus
writ
may
not
be
used
as
a
--
an
appeal.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
had
the
right.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
but
our
point
is,
your
honor,
he
could
have.
the
state
--
rather,
he's
afforded.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
--
he
could
have
raised
them
and
i
take
it,
even
though
he
had
escaped.
that
--
that
--
the
escape
does
nothing,
your
honor.
if
he
had
returned
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
within
his
30
days
and
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial,
he
would
have
--
he
would
have
been
there
within
the
30
days.
and
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
escape
and
the
interim
would
have
been
of
no
harm.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
sir.
that
--
we
have
no
case
directly
in
that
--
on
that
point.
but
following
the
federal
authorities
and
following
the
two
indiana
cases
on
that
point,
we
take
--
there
is
no
statement
in
the
--
in
any
of
those
cases
indicating
that
the
escape
itself
does
anything
to
this
man
in
(inaudible).
that
the
only
proposition
is
that
at
the
time
he
is
asking
a
court
to
act
in
his
favor,
he
must
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
and
if
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
oh
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
of
course.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
absolutely.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
they
have
done
this.
they
have
said
that
at
the
present
--
at
--
now,
no
remedy
exist.
they
don't
say
that
there
never
was
right
now.
i
come
back
to
the
moore
versus
dempsey
as
it's
been
stated
here
that
moore
versus
dempsey
said
that
there
was
one
time
a
remedy.
but
in
indiana,
this
--
this
man
did
have
a
remedy.
and
if
that
is
the
holding
in
the
moore
versus
dempsey
case,
i
--
i
suppose
this
does,
this
brings
it
fairly
close
to
the
--
to
the
situation.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
right.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
right.
now,
let
me
make
--
i
think
there's
a
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
same
situation
would
prevail,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
i
don't
--
well,
i
think
that
could
be
a
question,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
but
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
right.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
his
counsel
are
completely
without
clause,
your
honor
and
then
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
he
--
he's
--
he
has
been
adequately
represented.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
did
come
within
the
30-day
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
filed
within
the
30-day
rule
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
counsel
did
everything
that
was
physically
possible
for
them
to
do.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
was
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
that
is
--
as
far
as
counsel
was
concerned,
it
was
met.
as
far
as
leslie
irvin
was
concerned,
he
was
not
before
the
court
and
they
refused
to
consider
the
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
would
take
that
position
although
there's
no
case
over
that
fact.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
get
down
to
the
fact
that
he
--
his
appeal
was
predicated
upon
the
court's
ruling
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
and
the
court
overruled
the
motion
for
new
trial
for
the
reason
that
the
man
was
not
before
the
court.
that's
what
we
get
right
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
denied
the
motion.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
overruled.
and
i
should
use
the
exact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
overruled
the
motion.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
did
for
a
few
days,
your
honor.
he
held
that's
been
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
seriously
doubt
that
we
would,
your
honor,
although
i
mentioned
that
earlier.
irvin
and
i
are
happily
we're
not
faced
with
it.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
but
if
the
court
had
--
and
just
to
have
it,
well,
let's
say,
the
court
ruled
on
--
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
in
eisler.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
can
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
take
it
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
certainly
not
the
way
i'm
making
it
now.
no.
i
--
my
point
is
that
he
was
absent
when
the
court
purported
to
act
on
his
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
19th,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
don't
know
the
exact
day,
your
honor.
it
was
several
weeks
later.
he
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it's
something
like
that,
yes.
i
don't
know
the
exact.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
with
--
would
at
least
not
have
a
strong
a
case
as
we
have.
i
--
i
have
no
authority
for
that.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
that
he
would
have.
although
i
have
no
real
way
of
knowing
that.
there
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
and
it
was
--
and
there
is
no
authority
on
that
precise
factual
first
situation.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
i
do.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
am
in
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
what
they
held,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
maybe
i
should
explain
myself
a
little
more
thoroughly
here,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
indiana
has
a
procedure
whereby
a
man
can
file
a
belated
motion
for
new
trial.
this
30-day
period
is
a
--
a
statutory
period,
but
the
court
in
his
discretion
upon
matters
addressed
to
him
made
grant
additional
time,
a
belated
motion
for
new
trial.
and
had
the
judge
held
that
and
waited
until
the
man
returned,
it's
conceivable,
he
should
--
he
could
have
awarded
an
order
saying
that
he
has
treated
this
as
a
belated
motion
for
new
trial
and
handle
it
very
easily.
and
i
think
the
inference
would
have
been
that
if
he
had
purported
to
act
it
on
--
upon
the
merits,
it
would
--
that
would
have
been
the
situation,
but
we
don't
have
that.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
--
it's
not
a
--
it's
a
--
it's
case
law,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes.
we
have
the
two
cases,
sutherland
versus
state
of
indiana.
they're
cited
in
my
brief
at
page
11
and
sargent
versus
state.
and
that
the
sargent
versus
state
was
cited
in
allen
versus
georgia
by
this
court
with
approval
and
it's
a
well-established
principle
of
law
again
reiterated
in
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
don't
think
they
did,
your
honor.
i
think
justice
finnegan
of
the
--
judge
finnegan
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
makes
the
most
astute
observation
of
that.
he
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
even
though
they
said
that,
i
think
justice
finnegan
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
correct
when
he
says
that
what
they
said
in
regard
to
the
merits
was
dictum
in
the
case.
i
--
i
think
that
is
obvious
because
they
did
say
that
he
had
no
standing
in
court.
and
that
was
--
that's
--
was
finality.
then
they
went
ahead
and
said
at
--
as
though
to
--
went
outside
their
feeling
or
wherever
you
want
to
put
it.
here's
a
man
that's
going
to
die
and
i
know
from
my
own
small
part
in
this,
it's
no
easy
thing
to
address
yourself
to
a
case
where
a
human
life
is
at
stake
and
i
--
i
can
understand
the
reluctance.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
does,
your
honor
and
there
again,
the
--
the
belated
--
the
post-conviction
remedies
that
indiana
affords,
they
--
not
only
can
the
trial
court
entertain
a
belated
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
supreme
court
can
entertain
a
belated
appeal.
and
they
could,
i
take
it,
have
treated
this
as
though
it
were
a
belated
appeal
or
sent
it
back
and
ask
--
order
the
trial
judge
to
entertain
a
belated
motion
for
new
trial,
but
they
didn't
treat
it
in
that
fashion.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
had
not
been
asked
directly
to
do
that
but
because
i
think
--
i
don't
think
they
would
have
done
it
in
the
ordinary
case
but
because
in
a
capital
case,
i
think
they
took
requirements
out
to
do
that.
now,
i'm
only
presupposing
what
the
court
had
in
mind.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
before
the
supreme
court,
it's
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
i
--
in
--
before
the
court,
20
days.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
one
petition
to
rehearing,
yes.
we
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
you
see
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
right.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
see,
the
rule
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
not
directly.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
your
honor.
see,
no
motion
was
addressed
to
them.
i
--
i
say
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
they
--
they
recite
--
they
reviewed
them,
your
honor
but
i
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
feel
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
said
that,
your
honor,
yes.
but
--
but
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
i
don't
deny
that
they
would
have
had
the
power
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
think
this,
your
honor.
i
say
they
had
the
power.
i
think
with
proper
exercises
of
the
judicial
power,
that
power
would
have
been
exercised
in
conjunction
with
the
motion
to
that
effect
if
they
would
have
entertained
the
motion
approximate
to
that
effect
but
they
didn't.
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well
i
again,
track
back
to
judge
finnegan's
opinion.
i
think
he's
correct
in
saying
they
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
what
they
did
passed
on
and
considered,
your
honor,
was
the
fact
that
he
was
an
escapee
at
the
time
he
filed
his
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
didn't
discuss
it
at
any
length
or
--
or
any
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
just
--
they
make
up
a
statement,
a
--
a
cover
all
statement
concerning
the
merits.
they
don't
take
them
one
at
a
time
and
say,
this
is
no
indication
that
they
actually
examined
all
of
the
assignments.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
said
that.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
did.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
address
my
remaining
time
to
the
--
what
little
there
is
to
the
question
of
the
merits
of
this
case
arrived
here.
i
take
it
that
--
not
that
this
first
question
isn't
of
the
merits
actually
but
that
--
to
the
question
of
the
procedures
in
the
trial
court.
now,
the
first
question
that
is
raised
in
that
respect
is
a
question
on
the
voir
dire
examination.
mr.
lockyear
read
a
--
a
few
of
the
excerpts
that
they
have
incorporated
in
their
brief.
unfortunately,
this
record
as
you
know,
is
not
printed
and
we
have
their
excerpts.
we
have
placed
a
few
more
excerpts
in
our
brief
starting
at
page
15
and
continue
on
to
page
22.
and
those
are
only
exemplary
to
this
--
the
--
the
bulk
of
this
big
record,
this
voir
dire
examination.
and
to
go
into
all
this
would
have
been
quite
voluminous
as
far
as
the
briefs
are
concerned.
but
with
what
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
that
the
citation
is
therein
contained,
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
portions
questioned
by
the
petitioner
here
are
small
portions
of
the
voir
dire
examination
occurring
early
in
the
examination
of
these
particular
witnesses
that
there
are,
is
much
more
in
the
record,
contained
on
the
subject
that
the
--
the
prospective
jurors
were
examined
at
length
that
they
demonstrated
confusion
as
to
the
state
of
law
and
that
they
did
qualify
under
the
indiana
statute
on
that
subject.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
is
not
the
complete
story,
your
honor.
and
for
--
i
think
there
again,
we
have
no
record
to
refer
to.
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
in
the
record
that
that
was
continued
on
in
transcript
volume
5
page
3659,
this
citation
appears
on
our
brief.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
3659.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
59.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
line
19
to
page
3667,
line
5.
that
citation,
your
honor,
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
--
on
page
16
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
and
a
summation
of
what
is
contained
therein
appears
just
ahead
of
that
in
our
brief.
and
we
take
the
position
that
the
record
clearly
discloses
there
that
juror
hensley
was
qualified
under
the
statute
in
indiana.
we
also
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
this
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
something
that's
absolutely
essential
to
the
qualification
of
jurors.
we
--
in
the
case
of
reynolds
against
united
states,
that's
referred
to
in
--
by
judge
parkinson,
has
the
district
court
opinion
on
this
case.
that's
in
98
united
states
155,
united
states
report.
the
principle
was
laid
down
--
was
stated
that
in
this
year
or
--
and
this
was
in
1879
that
they
--
and
certainly
if
it
prevailed
and
it
prevails
today,
they
said
there
that
in
this
era
of
fast
communication
and
public
information
and
so
forth
that
people
must,
by
necessity,
be
informed
of
the
happenings
in
their
community.
and
that
goes
and
states
why
jurors
must
be
qualified
although
they
may
entertain
some
opinion
as
to
what
transpired
in
this
particular
instant
that
they
nevertheless
must
be
qualified
or
--
and
must
--
state
must
be
permitted
to
qualify
them
to
try
a
case.
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
for
recess,
we're
discussing
the
jurors.
now,
i
would
just
again
stress
that
we
most
strongly
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
examine
the
entire
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jurors
who
did
serve
and
those
jurors
--
or
the
jurors
who
are
questioned,
i
should
say,
and
those
jurors
are
set
out
in
our
brief
starting
at
page
15
and
thereafter.
and
comments
and
citations
to
the
direct
comments
upon
and
citations
to
the
record
concerning
their
voir
dire
examination
are
contained
there.
and
i
think,
at
most,
i
can
serve
as
an
--
serve
an
index
for
you
to
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
was
over
200,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
can't
state
the
exact
number,
but
i
think
it
was
over
200.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
was
in
the
nature
of
two
weeks,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
four
weeks.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
was
four
weeks.
this
was
quite
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
lengthy.
this
record
largely
consists
of
the
voir
dire
examination,
and
it
is
near
6000
pages.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
don't
know
the
exact
time
on
that.
again,
i
refer
to
trial
counsel.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
about
a
week
he
says
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
now,
we
submit
that
after
an
examination
of
this
record
concerning
the
qualifications
of
these
jurors,
it
would
become
evident
to
the
court
that
the
jury
or
each
member
of
the
jury
who
actually
sat
in
this
case
was
qualified
under
the
indiana
statute,
that
the
indiana
statute
is
a
statement
in
the
reynolds
--
of
the
reynolds
case.
actually,
the
reasoning
is
set
out
in
the
reynolds
case
that
--
that
is
a
necessary
view
under
our
present
civilization.
we
--
it's
impossible
to
keep
things
of
this
matter
out
of
the
newspapers.
i
think
it
would
be
unadvisable
to
keep
them
out
of
the
newspaper.
now,
we
often
know
--
we
all
know
of
instances
where
newspapers
may
go
too
far
and
try
to
use
their
own
influence,
but
as
far
as
a
factual
reporting
in
what
does
occur,
i
think,
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
type
of
civilization
which
we
live.
i
think
it
has
a
very
significant
benefit
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
your
honor.
i
said
the
reporting
in
news
is
essential
and
very
often
they
do
overstepped
their
boundaries.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
against
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
certainly
that
they
very
often
do
exceed
the
boundaries.
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
only
two
of
the
murders
in
indiana,
your
honor,
the
remainder
was
in
kentucky.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
you
see
this
--
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
let
me
explain
this
very
briefly,
the
physical
setup.
evansville
is
in
southern
tip
of
indiana.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
the
--
and
murders,
although,
occurring
in
kentucky
where
in
the
same
community
actually,
right
across
the
river,
and
so
--
although
--
somewhere
in
kentucky
and
somewhere
in
evansville,
this
is
actually
a
community
episode.
there
are
series
of
episodes
within
a
single
community.
but
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
makes
the
--
an
observation
here
that
they
don't
always
report
it
like
they
should
and
that's
--
i
think
that's
correct.
now,
that
gets
us
to
the
point
of
the
necessity
of
the
statute
as
it
exists
here.
we
know
we
can't
control
newspapers
absolutely
and
maybe
we
don't
want
to
but
we
have
a
faced
with
a
factual
situation,
what
does
actually
occur?
now,
we
have
to
presume
that
those
persons
chosen
for
jury
duty
are
literate
person.
they
--
they
are
persons
who
read
and
they
listen
to
radio
and
watch
television
in
a
community.
we
hope
that
they,
at
least,
have
that
much
intelligence
to
serve
on
a
jury.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
now,
that's
questionable
too,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
know
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
there
is
a
man
in
evansville
who
has
a
news
program
and
he
sought
out
and
interviewed
the
attorneys
and
he
talks
to
various
people
concerning
the
trial.
he
observed
that
i
presume
himself.
and
--
and
he
made
a
report
and
--
and
news
happen
as
was
done
on
many,
many
cases
and
cases
that
we
are
all
familiar.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
doubt
that,
your
honor.
but
we
are
faced
with
that
factual
situation.
and
so,
we
--
we
must
speak
from
a
community
people
who
are
qualified
to
try
the
case.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
oh,
no,
your
honor,
this
is
a
fairly
old
statute
in
indiana.
i
think
it
came
in
about
1905.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
but
i
--
i
stand
up
for
the
statute.
i
think
the
statute
is
a
good
statute.
it
qualified
--
once
a
man
is
qualified
--
otherwise
if
--
if
we
didn't
--
if
we
couldn't
qualify
a
juror
in
that
manner,
i
submit
that
we
--
we
have
no
--
we'd
have
--
well,
we
have
two
choices.
we'd
have
a
--
an
ability
to
have
an
illiterate
juror
that
couldn't
read
and
hadn't
heard
any
television
show
and
he
must
obliviously
to
the
facts
or
we'd
have
some
thought
deliberately
lied
and
said
they
didn't
hear
anything
and
that
his
mind
wasn't
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
just
think
the
statute
is
a
wording
of
--
really,
the
essential
of
this
--
the
fundamental
reading
is
laid
down
in
the
reynolds
case
was
laid
down
about
years
ago
by
this
court
and
that's
all
it
is.
it's
just
--
it's
really
a
guide
for
the
court,
and
i
think
a
very
good
guide,
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
didn't
take
a
change
in
venue,
your
honor.
you
see,
this
case
was
venued
from
vanderburgh
county.
this
case
originated
in
vanderburgh
county
and
it
was
venued
to
posey
county
where
the
trial
occurred.
gibson
county,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
it's
fairly
close.
it's
[laughs]
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
statute
says
the
most
convenient
county,
your
honor,
the
general
practice
in
indiana
is
adjoining.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
take
it,
i
take
it.
it
--
they
--
at
least
we
there's
the
practice
is
adjoining
counties.
the
statute
--
the
actual
language
of
the
statute
is
most
convenient,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
our
supreme
court
has
held
not,
your
honor.
an
attempt
was
made
at
that
in
state
ex
rel.
fox
into
fourth
circuit
court
and
which
was
decided
just
prior
to
or
while
this
case
was
really
in
process.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
the
judge
could
not
do
that.
that's
what
he
had
in
fact
done.
he
had
made
a
finding
that
there
was
prejudice
in
the
community
and
had
ordered
the
venue
and
the
court
said
he
could
not
do
that
and
entered
a
prohibition
against
him
doing
such
a
thing.
but
--
and
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
by
one
of
our
best
judges
in
many
years,
judge
emmert
on
that
subject.
he
dissents
to
that.
and
i
would
refer
to
his
dissenting
opinion
and
submit
that
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
they
--
they
appear
--
sought
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
a
change
of
venue.
and
i
would
say
that
although
judge
emmert
says
that
this
is
improper,
he
bases
his
decision
on
the
ground
that
the
judge
in
that
case
had
found
that
there
was
prejudice
in
the
community.
therefore,
it
should
have
been
taken
out.
in
the
irvin
case,
it
--
the
opposite
was
true.
the
judge
made
an
affirmative
finding.
there
was
not
prejudice
in
the
community.
he
refused
to
send
it.
well,
he
didn't
--
that's
not
exactly
true
either.
he
followed
the
statute,
i
should
say,
but
he
refused
to
put
that
one.
he
refused
to
grant
the
writ.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
that
gets
us
to
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
relation
to
the
continuance
situation.
first
of
all,
continuance
in
indiana,
as
it
is
most
place,
is
a
discretionary
matter,
a
--
an
old
case
walker
versus
state,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
at
page
25
thereabouts
so
hold.
and
i
think
that's
a
universal
rule.
now
--
and
it
gets
to
be
a
matter
then,
did
the
court
abuse
his
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
grant
his
continuance
in
this
community
where
possible
prejudice
exist?
now,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
dates
involved
here.
this
crime
was
committed
on
december
23rd,
1954.
publicity,
of
course,
immediately
started.
as
you
will
note
from
the
publications
there
and
this
is
rather
bizarre
crime.
these
people
were
methodically
executed
following
a
robbery,
a
think
that
was
sort
of
terrifying
to
the
community.
and
they
were
publicized
widely.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
that
started
on
december
23rd,
1954.
leslie
irvin
was
arrested
on
april
8,
1955
as
a
parole
violator
not
for
this
crime.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
as
far
as
the
--
the
occurrence
is.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
couldn't
tell
you
just
to
how
--
for
how
--
what
length
of
period
this
occurred.
but
the
--
the
arrest
of
leslie
irvin
occurred
on
april
8,
1955.
he
was
arrested
not
for
these
murders
but
as
a
parole
violator
and
so
held
in
custody.
while
he
was
being
held
as
a
parole
violator,
then
he
was
interrogated
concerning
these
murders
because
they
knew
him
and
so
for
certain
things
pointed
to
his
guilt
in
this
case,
and
they
barked
on
interrogation.
now,
the
voir
dire
examination
in
this
case
did
not
start
until
november
the
14th,
1955.
and
we
see
from
those
dates
that
it
was
four
months
from
the
time
this
kerr
murder
was
committed
until
leslie
irvin
was
arrested.
it
was
seven
more
months
from
the
time
he
was
arrested
and
held
in
custody
continuously.
it
was
seven
more
months
before
the
--
they
started
to
pick
a
jury
to
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
publicity
concerning
the
confessions
was,
your
honor,
around
december
or
april
the
14th
of
1955.
and
that
was
shortly
after
he
was
arrested
on
april
8th.
and
on
april
14th,
i
believe,
he
was
--
he
made
his
statements
and
that
was
when
the
--
the
glaring
headlines
concerning
confessed
--
confession.
so
and
now
--
of
course,
they
carry
the
same
theme.
every
time
this
would
come
up,
they
carry
the
same
thing.
they
did
the
same
--
the
same
publicity
more
or
less
occurred
when
judge
parkinson
had
it
before
him.
and
i
dare
say
the
same
publicity
will
appear
in
evansville
tomorrow
after
this
hearing.
his
--
this
is
something
that
comes
up
every
time
the
man
has
heard.
and
so,
i
think
judge
parkinson
made
a
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
you
may
be
furnishing
some
fuel
for
the
fire,
your
honor.
[laughter]
a
--
nevertheless,
this
had
been
seven
months
from
the
time
the
man
had
been
arrested,
and
seven
months
possibly
less
a
couple
of
days
from
the
time
he
had
entered
his
confession
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
same,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
same
thing,
it's
--
publicity,
interviews
with
radio
and
so
forth,
attendance,
heavy
attendance
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
at
the
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
oh,
no,
your
honor.
it
didn't
continue.
this
--
every
time
something
important
came
up
in
the
case
and
the
newspaper
people
who
are
there
to
follow.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it's
a
sensational
thing.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think,
your
honor,
that
i
--
that
examination
of
the
jury
panel,
i
think,
should
be
examined
very
closely.
you'll
note
in
my
brief
i
set
out
one
of
the
statements
made
by
a
juror
in
which
he
said,
“i've
learned
more
here
than
i
ever
did
from
the
newspaper.”
because
the
--
the
juror
--
jury
panel
was
there
and
then
they
--
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
would
methodically
go
through
this
whole
business
about
these
other
murders.
and
so
we're
reviewing
the
newspaper
and
if
stories
--
and
if
any
juror
was
not
informed
at
that
time,
he
certainly
became
informed
before
he
ever
was
questioned
because
he
heard
the
whole
business
recited
over
and
over
again.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
is,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
he
was.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
don't
think
his
account
of
the
alleged
confession
was
published.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
sir,
that
is
another
point
that
i
should
make,
and
i
was
his
--
would
be
one
of
my
next
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
just
a
substance
of
what
he
said.
this
was
not
a
written
confession,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
this
was
an
oral
confession.
i
think
the
substance
of
what
he
said
was
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
didn't
hear
what
you
say,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir,
this
started
in
april
was
when
--
his
confession
was
in
april.
now,
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
assume
that
these
things
were
reiterated
from
time
to
time
by
news
carrying
agencies.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
that
--
it
hasn't
stopped
yet,
this
--
the
publicity
will
still,
i
--
i
take
it.
they
all
carry
the
same
sort
of
thing,
“confessed
killer”,
“mad
dog
killer”
and
so
forth.
i
--
i
take
it
that
those
--
that
same
terminology
will
still
be
used.
now,
that
brings
us
to
the
confession.
we
have
had
the
statement
made
here
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
have
leslie
irvin
testify
as
to
his
side
of
this
confession.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
the
true
picture.
that
from
the
--
and
it's
set
up
in
my
--
the
citations
of
the
record
are
set
out
in
my
brief
at
page
29.
and
if
you
start
at
the
record
of
transcript,
volume
2,
page
1306
and
go
to
volume
3
to
page
13
or
1613,
it's
in
my
brief
at
page
29,
citation.
if
you
start
there
and
read,
you
will
discover
that
there
was
a
complete
hearing
as
to
all
aspects
of
leslie
irvin's
arrest
and
his
interrogation
and
the
statements
he
made.
and
those
statements
that
he
made
were,
i
submit,
given
without
any
kind
of
coercion
at
all.
he
--
i
think
this
record
is
very
clear
that
he
had
every
opportunity,
if
he
so
chose,
to
testify.
never
--
no
place.
now,
things
were
made,
he
was
denied
the
right
to
testify.
i
submit
you
will
find
nowhere
in
the
record
where
he
was
denied
the
right
to
testify.
he
certainly
could
have
testified
if
he
so
desire
but
he
did
not
choose
to
--
to
testify.
now,
i
submit
that
the
--
the
court
did
laid
--
they
do
quote
language
where
the
court
overruled
the
motion
without
having
any
hearing.
but
he
--
this
was
immediately
following
this
exhaustive
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
this
confession.
and
i
submit
that
it
would've
been
completely
useless
to
have
had
that
hearing
over
again.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
was
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
that
brings
us
to
paul
wever
and
his
part
that
he
played
in
this
confession.
now,
this
confession
was
not
heard
alone
by
paul
wever.
it
was
heard
by
the
chief
of
detective
hudson
and
certain
portions
of
it
actually
were
wire
recorded
in
many
likewise
appeared
and
it's
--
and
--
but
that's
here
and
there.
this
time
they
were
concerned
with
paul
wever's
testimony
concerning
the
confession.
paul
wever
merely
testified
that
he
was
call
--
summoned
by
leslie
irvin
to
tell
him
a
story.
and
it
was
roughly
this,
he
said,
“are
you
going
to
try
me
in
kentucky
or
you're
going
to
--
are
you
going
to
try
me
in
indiana,
you're
going
send
me
back
to
kentucky?”
paul
wever
said,
“they
don't
have
enough
evidence
to
try
you
in
indiana
at
this
time
unless
there
is
a
weapon
you
need.
i
need
the
gun
for
one
thing,
and
he
said,
“well,
take
me
out
and
i'll
show
you
where
it
was.”
well,
it's
--
to
be
very
brief
about
it,
he
took
him
out
and
they
found
the
gun
eventually
where
leslie
irvin
had
indicated
and
so
forth.
that
was
what
paul
wever
testified
too
but
this
was
also
testified
too
by
chief
of
detective
hudson.
and
paul
wever's
testimony
was
just
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
mr.
wever
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
mr.
wever
testified
as
to
what
leslie
irvin
told
him
just
roughly
what
i
have
said
about.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
this
--
that
was
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
confession
and
i've
short
--
considered
he
gave
a
detailed
story
of
what
he
said
but
so
did
the
detective
who
was
there.
paul
wever's
testimony
was
merely
cumulative.
it
was
in
keeping
with
the
cases
that
we
have
in
indiana
along
the
lines
that
he
can
testify
to
something
of
this
nature.
he
was
--
not
that
it's
--
i'm
not
advocating
that
a
thing
necessarily
but
i
say
this,
that
it
was
not
something
that
would
be
prejudicial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
only
thing
that
he
said
and
their
--
their
remark
have
referred
to
it.
my
best
memory
of
it
is
that
he
says,
“you,
yourself,
heard
what
i
told
you
about
this.”
i
think
that's
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
it's
pretty
strong.
i
guess
that's
the
effect
of
what
he
said
that's
going
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
pretty
far
but
i
did
still
think
it
fall
short
of
it
than
i
would
do
promptly.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
strong,
your
honor,
that
he
says
--
he's
saying
--
he's
just
saying
--
he's
summing
up
to
the
jury
and
he's
saying
that
you
heard
what
i
told.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
your
honor,
the
--
there's
no
authority
that
i
know
of,
anywhere
in
indiana
for
the
reporting
of
the
final
argument
of
counsel
to
the
jury
to
become
a
part
of
the
record.
he's
not
a
part
of
the
record.
there's
no
way
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
that
--
that
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
none
of
it
was
transcribed.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
it's
still
none
of
it
--
that
part
that
was
--
or
that
part
that
was
placed
in
a
record
and
it
is
today
in
the
record
is
only
the
part
that
paul
wever
say
concerning
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
correct.
no
further
proceeding
that
we
had
in
indiana.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
a
man
named
whitney
wesley
kerr
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
who
--
he
was
a
filling
station
attendant.
this
was
a
filling
station
in
vanderburgh.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
this
--
each
case
said
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
he
is
accused
of
having
committed.
it
was
a
robbery
case
and
in
each
instance
the
victim,
i
believe,
was
shot
at
the
back
of
the
head.
it
was
a
rather
bizarre
thing.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
substantially
so,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
thank
you.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
did
invoke
that
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
--
yes,
sir.
we
took
the
position
that
we
were
not
trying
to
dismiss
this
case,
that
the
assignment
of
error
was
that
the
court
overruled
the
appellant's
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
we
were
taking
the
position
that
he
was
justified
in
so
doing,
and
we
addressed
our
argument
to
that
fact.
we
--
this
was
--
we
didn't
take
the
position
ever
in
this
case
that
we
were
trying
to
have
a
--
an
appeal
dismissed.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
did,
your
honor,
and
that
was
our
first
opposition
to
it
and
our
first
statement
address
to
the
--
to
the
assignment
of
error
that
the
court
erred
in
overruling
appellant's
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
oh,
no.
we
took
the
position
that
the
appeal
was
properly
there.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
this,
your
honor,
we
said
that
the
court
did
not
err
in
overruling
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
we
submitted
that
his
reason
for
overruling
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
that
the
man
was
not
there,
that
he
never
got
to
the
merits,
that
he
overrule
it
because
the
man
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
was
not
there.
we
never
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
questioned
the
right
to
the
appeal.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
right.
we
--
that
was
the
first
point
in
our
brief.
we
just
--
we
didn't
try
to
do
this
by
a
motion
to
dismiss.
we
submitted
this
as
the
first
part
of
our
brief
on
the
merits
of
the
thing.
that
was
our
first
reason
for
stating
to
the
court
that
the
trial
court
did
not
err
in
overruling
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
this
--
the
whole
case
on
the
so-called
merits
that
we
--
and
we're
using
the
term
“merits”
useally
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
understand
what
we're
saying
the
only
--
the
argument
on
the
merits
was,
of
course,
the
--
they
did.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
--
no,
they
don't,
your
honor.
they
--
they
--
i'd
still
go
back
that
they
based
it
on
the
--
this
--
this
one
proposition
and
then
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
pass
on
the
other
in
passing.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
there's
not
much
of
a
statement.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
just
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
was
our
position.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
did.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
not
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
hate
to
belabor
that
because
i
don't
know
it
makes
too
much
difference
in
a
case,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
still
go
back
to
their
language
what
they
say
and
they
--
they
indicated
that
they
were
--
they
were
deciding
it
on
this
one
point
and
then
they
--
they
passed
on
to
the
others.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
did
not
and
they
were
never
asked
to,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
they
affirmed
the
appeal.
they
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
they
were
never
asked
to
dismiss.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
we
could
not
have.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we
had
filed
--
we
anticipated
none.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
absolutely.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
(voice
overlap)
the
number
of
copies,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
have
a
copy
with
the
court.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
there
is
no
index.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
we're
happy
to
do
that,
your
honor.
