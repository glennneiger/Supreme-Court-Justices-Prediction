mr.
theodore
lockyear
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
20th
of
december
in
the
year
1955,
petitioner,
leslie
irvin,
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
on
the
circuit
--
a
jury
on
the
circuit
court
of
gibson
county,
indiana,
and
sentenced
to
death.
thereafter,
the
cause
was
appealed
to
the
indiana
supreme
court.
certiorari
was
sought
in
this
court
but
denied
with
the
notation
without
prejudice
to
the
petitioner's
right,
filed
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
courts
after
exhaustion
of
his
state
remedy.
habeas
corpus
was
found,
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
sought
in
the
united
states
district
court,
northern
district
of
indiana.
court
issued
the
writ,
matter
was
heard
and
thereafter,
the
writ
was
dissolved.
cause
was
then
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
certiorari
was
again
sought
and
granted.
we
feel
this
a
most
unusual
case
and
the
facts
are
principally
in
the
record
that
was
presented
to
the
indiana
supreme
court.
and
by
stipulation
of
the
parties
entered
into
the
hearing
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
time
of
the
hearing.
the
court
were
advised
by
the
--
a
clerk
waved
the
printing
of
this
record,
5000
pages,
petitioner
comes
here
as
a
proper.
the
record
in
the
district
court
was
not
printed
because
the
parties
were
unable
to
stipulate
as
to
what
portion
should
be
printed.
but
we
feel
that
the
facts,
if
the
court
will
permit,
as
each
point
is
presented
will
present
the
facts
applicable
to
that
particular
point.
today
we
feel
is
a
historical
day
in
the
history
of
this
court.
for
the
first
time
in
history,
i
believe,
a
witness
who
participated
in
a
trial
is
here
in
this
courtroom
assisting
the
attorney
general
of
the
--
of
the
state
of
indiana
in
a
prosecution
of
the
appeal
in
this
cause,
is
that
with
great
significance.
and
it
turns
out
that
this
man
is
also
the
man
who
has
prosecutor
participated
in
the
selection
of
the
jury,
testified
as
a
witness
after
having
examined
witnesses
in
the
state's
case,
and
thereafter
was
permitted
to
make
a
closing
argument
to
the
jury
and
comment
on
his
own
testimony.
this
man,
mr.
weaver
is
in
the
courtroom
today.
he's
been
here
all
week.
justice
duffy
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
violated
a
petitioner's
rights
with
regards
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
due
process.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
was
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
was
allowed
to
examine
the
jurors,
examine
witnesses
and
then
was
allowed
over
our
objection.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
to
--
to
be
a
witness.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
with
reference
to
a
confession
purportedly
made
to
him.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
an
oral
confession
made
to
him.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
this
at
the
trial,
yes,
sir.
and
heard
by
the
jury,
it
was
introduced
in
the
evidence.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
it's
our
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
whole
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
--
course
of
conduct
and
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no.
but
if
--
nor
would
it
be
a
violation
of
canon
19.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
but
after
he
has
once
taken
the
stand
and
testified,
then
he
should
withdraw
from
the
cause
that
he
is
presenting.
he
should
leave
the
trial
to
other
counsel.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
we
think
when
he
is
permitted
then
to
argue
the
case
to
the
jury
and
comment
on
his
own
testimony.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
--
and
there
is
a
very
serious
question
which
we
get
into
later
on
as
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
a
confession.
the
objection
was
not
--
no
evidence
was
ever
heard
on
that
question,
and
that
--
that
is
one
of
my
other
points.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
was
permitted.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
permitted
him
and
we
have
in
the
record.
i
told
you
what
was
told
to
me
myself.
the
court
refused
to
permit
this
to
be
reported.
the
entire
brief
and
proceedings
of
--
in
the
lower
court
are
reported
except
this
oral
argument.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
court
refused
to
let
us
report
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
i
--
and
the
way
we
did
it,
the
court
would
not
permit
the
oral
argument
to
be
reported.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
any
of
mr.
weaver's
oral
argument.
that's
right.
then
we,
under
an
indiana
procedure,
prepared
affidavits
and
--
mr.
loft
and
myself
prepared
affidavits
based
upon
part
of
this
testimony
which
includes
his
comment
that
i
told
my
--
you
myself
what
was
told
to
me.
and
then
the
court
approved
that,
that
is
a
bill
of
exceptions
which
is
in
the
record
and
then
the
court
approved
that
as
being
a
part
of
the
record
and
what
was
said
at
that
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
it
is
a
part
of
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
all
this
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
in
gibson
county,
indiana
which
is
in
the
town
of
princeton,
indiana.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
community
of
30,000,
community
of
30,000.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
just
his
memory.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
of
all
of
them,
your
honor.
what
happened
and
that
gets
me
--
i
can
get
over
to
that
point
real
quickly.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
on
april
the
8th,
the
question
was
asked.
this
is
found
in
transcript
page
1306,
“what
did
the
petitioner
say
to
you
on
april
8,
1955?”
and
we
objected
and
a
hearing
was
had
at
that
time.
and
the
court,
after
hearing
the
evidence
--
and
the
answer
was
that
he
didn't
say
anything
about
the
murder
of
whitney
wesley
kerr.
then
on
april
the
12th,
the
question
was
asked,
not
--
the
question
was
asked,
“what
did
he
say
to
you
on
april
the
12th,
1955?”
and
then
we
made
an
objection
and
in
an
offer
to
prove
as
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession,
and
the
court
denied
that
motion,
denied
the
offer
to
prove
and
the
witness
was
permitted
to
testify
of
what
he
said.
no
hearing
was
had
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
we've
raised
here.
the
same
objection
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
offer
to
prove,
it's
found
on
our
brief
at
page
60,
the
last
part
of
it,
page
67.
“that
the
defendant
did
not
voluntarily,
freely
under
any
circumstances
make
any
statement
or
confession
to
this
witness
or
any
other
police
officer,
in
whose
custody
he
was
at
the
said
time
or
which
the
defendant
now
ask
leave
of
court
to
prove
and
introduce
evidence
to
prove
the
same.”
the
court,
“objection
overruled.”
witness
answering,
“he
told
me
that
he
had
shot
and
killed
wesley
kerr.”
mr.
theodore
lockyear
shooting
wesley
kerr.
yes,
sir.
and
the
same
objection
was
made
thereafter
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
weaver
and
several
other
police
officers.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no,
sir.
that
was
at
the
trial.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no,
sir.
no.
the
state
would
contend
at
this
time
that
a
hearing
was
had
on
the
question,
“what
was
said
on
april
the
8th?”
and
that
--
that
was
all
the
hearing
that
you
were
entitled
to
because
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
a
hearing
was
had
at
that
time.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
on
the
voluntariness
and
that
was
principally
on
the
arrest
and
the
--
what
occurred
there
--
there
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
thereafter.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
not
all
of
it,
your
honor
because
he
was
not
permitted
to
testify
himself
nor
was
he
permitted
to
introduce
other
evidence
that
would
have
covered
the
period
of
time
of
april
the
12th
and
april
the
15th.
the
question
was
limited
to
what
was
said
on
april
8th.
and
the
answer
was
that
--
as
we
got
into
that
after
the
hearing
was
started,
he
didn't
say
anything.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
state
supreme
court
took
the
position
that
he
had
escaped
and
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
that
any
motion
of
new
trial
had
been
filed
on
his
behalf.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
and
that,
although
they
didn't
consider
this
point,
they
took
the
position
that
the
evidence
heard
on
the
8th,
question
on
the
8th
was
controlling.
and
they
took
the
position
that
the
escape
was
the
controlling
fact
in
the
case.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
none
of
these
questions,
except
that
in
their
opinion,
they
sum
up
on
--
in
139
n.e.
2d,
902
and
this
is
all
they
have
to
say.
it
does
not
appear
from
the
record
in
all
--
an
argument
had
that
the
appellant
was
denied
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
due
course
of
law
under
the
bill
of
rights,
constitution
article
i,
section
12.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
sir?
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
--
that's
their
--
that's
this
old
decision
that
they
made.
they
didn't
make
an
individual.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
we
feel
that
very
strongly,
and
the
same
position
that
was
taken
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
followed
the
indiana
court
in
holding
at
the
escape
bar
him
the
right
to
appeal,
but
the
district
court
uses
these
almost
the
same
words,
although
this
court
could
rest
its
decision
here
squarely
upon
the
failure
of
the
petitioner
to
exhaust
his
remedies
in
the
state
courts
of
indiana.
we
will
come
--
we
will
consider
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
where
he
claims
denial
of
due
process,
whether
they
present
nonfederal
question
--
procedural
question
under
law
of
indiana
or
federal
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
he
made
the
same
basic
decision.
he
took
the
position
and
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
to
have
another
hearing
but
he
ignores
the
fact
that
that
would
--
we
would
have
had
the
right
to
present
other
evidence
including
the
petitioner's
own
right
to
testify
as
to
the
april
12th.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
time
when
escape
came
in
at
--
on
--
the
trifle,
we
don't
know,
we
weren't
there.
but
on
the
morning
of
the
19th
of
january,
when
we
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
court
was
advised
by
the
sheriff
that
he
was
not
entrusted.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
after
conviction.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
was
rearrested
some
three
weeks
later,
within
a
month
he
was
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
about
three
weeks
and
was
back
in
michigan
city
within
a
month,
almost
that
day.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
what?
he
was
not
in
custody.
now,
the
escape,
whether
it's
an
escape
or
not
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
all
right.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
was
not
there,
that's
right,
sir.
but
there
was
no
objection
entered
at
that
time
we
filed
the
motion.
no
objection
made
by
counsel
for
the
attorney
general
or
for
the
prosecutors.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
they
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
they
did
not
dismiss
the
appeal.
they
did
not.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
they
affirmed
and
commented.
they
held
that
we
had
no
authority
to
file
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
but
they
did
say
what
i've
just
read
to
you
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
--
as
to
the
deprivation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
yes,
sir.
the
appeal
--
and
no
--
no
motion
was
ever
made
to
dismiss
this
appeal
in
the
indiana
supreme
court.
motions
were
made
to
appeal
as
proper.
they
were
granted
extensions
of
time,
printing
of
the
record,
all
of
those
things
were
made
by
mr.
loft
and
myself
on
behalf
of
petitioner,
mr.
givan
has
represented
the
attorney
general
and
no
objection
was
ever
made
to
our
proceeding.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
in
bland
versus
state
which
is
in
our
opinion
--
in
our
brief
which
is
back
to
indiana
which
is
1839
that
they
did
consider
the
man's
appeal.
he
had
--
he
had
escape
while
the
appeal
was
pending.
and
while
he
was
gone,
the
time
for
which
the
--for
his
sentence
of
death
had
expired.
he
came
back
and
objected
to
resentencing
him
to
death.
he
said
that,
“the
time
has
expired.
you
can't
sentence
me
to
death.”
and
the
court
said
that
we
--
that
that
is
of
course
no
merit,
but
they
considered
every
ground
raised
in
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
raised
on
appeal,
case
of
bland
versus
state
which
is
in
our
brief
on
page
126,
justice
harlan.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right.
that
was
a
hundred
years
ago.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
but
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
only
difference
is
in
the
time
for
filing
a
motion
for
new
trial,
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
i
think
it
had.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
you're
asking
if
our
man
has
--
hadn't
escaped
at
that
time
for
filing
a
motion
for
new
trial.
he
was
out
of
the
custody
of
the
sheriff.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
i
--
that
is
part
of
my
argument.
now,
the
escape
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
as
to
the
date
of
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
well
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
all
right.
he
was
--
all
right.
the
murder
was
alleged
have
happened
in
december
of
1954.
thereafter,
on
the
8th
of
april
1955,
petitioner
was
arrested
for
the
first
time.
some
seven
days
later,
he
was
arraigned
for
the
first
time
after
having
purportedly
made
an
oral
confession
two
days
prior
to
his
arraignment.
he
was
indicted
that
same
month,
april
1955.
and
then
in
may
1955,
the
cause
was
venue
out
of
vanderburgh
county
to
gibson
county,
indiana.
thereafter,
from
may
1955
until
november
the
14th
1955,
he
was
in
the
gibson
county,
indiana
jail
awaiting
trial.
the
trial
was
commenced
on
november
the
14th
1955
by
the
selection
of
the
jury
which
consumed
some
three
and
a
half
weeks.
i
could
get
into
the
facts
then
into
the
selection
of
the
jury
if
the
court
would
want
me
to
at
this
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
it's
certainly
an
issue.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
all
right.
the

consisted
of
examining
431

269

mr.

no,
sir.
the

remained

had
10

mr.
theodore

we
had
20
in

mr.

now,
prior

for

for

continuous
delay
of
the
trial.
we
had
a
week
prior

also
filed
a
motion
for
a

existing

the

the

a

an
interview.
now,
this
interview
is
significant
and
that
they
never

in

anything
that

for

mr.

“
i
think
probably
the
most
unusual
thing
in
this
case
is
the
unusual
coverage
given
to
the
case
by
the
newspapers
and
radio.
this
is
what
has
caused
us
so
much
trouble
in
the
getting
of
jury
of
people
who
are
not
unbiased
and
unprejudiced
in
the
case.
and
the
publicity
attached
to
this
case
has
made
it
difficult
to
begin
trying
it.
”answer,
“very.”
mr.

no,
sir.
it
was
not

where
--
where
is
the
record
that
we
had
here?
it's
significant
in
that
record
likewise
that
this
press
release
which
gave
the
details
of
this
crime
--
these
crimes
to
the
newspaper
and
radiomen.
there
is
a

here
of
mr.

the
same
prosecutor
who
testified.
mr.

he
was
the
one
who
was
on

this
is
on

of

that
is
the
full,
yes.
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
significant.
that
is
an
admission
on
the
state's
part
that
the
jury
was
prejudiced
and
that
the
jurors
who
were
coming
through
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
well,
i
haven't
had
that
much
experience,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
the
experience
--
the
common
practice.
now,
after
these
three-week
examination
of
prospective
jurors
and
the
number
that
were
interviewed,
as
set
out
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
is
part
of
the
testimony
of
those
jurors
who
served
including
juror
ernest
hensley
who
testified
over
on
page
19
to
set
aside
this
opinion,
“would
it
require
any
evidence?”
“oh,
yes,
it
would
require
evidence
to
set
it
aside.”
“it
would
require
some
evidence?”
“yes.”
“so
you
think
that
it
would
require
evidence
from
the
defendant?”
“evidence
direct
from
the
defendant.”
and
over
on
page
20
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
says
--
his
answer
is
evidence
direct
from
the
defendant.
and
then
the
next
question
was,
“are
from
somebody
on
his
behalf,
somebody
on
his
behalf?”
“yes,
i
think
so.”
that's
down
about
the
bottom
third
of
the
page,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
and
then
over
on
page
20
about
midway,
question
was
asked.
“now,
you
understand
the
law
to
be
that
the
defendant
ordinarily
in
a
criminal
case
is
presumed
to
be
innocent?”
“yes.”
question,
“until
proven
guilty?
now,
in
this
particular
case
because
of
this
opinion
of
yours,
would
you
presume
the
defendant
be
guilty?”
“well,
i
wouldn't
until
i
heard
evidence
otherwise.”
and
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
“so
on
this
particular
case
--“
mr.
theodore
lockyear
“you
would
until
you
heard
some
other
evidence
of
his
innocence,
wouldn't
you?”
“that's
right.”
“then
you
would
presume
then
starting
out
on
the
trial
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
until
you
heard
evidence
from
him
or
someone
else
on
his
behalf
of
his
innocence.”
“yes,
sir.”
it
--
it
repeats
itself,
your
honor.
and
on
page
21,
“so
on
this
particular
case,
you
could
not
enter
in
to
this
matter
and
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
he
is
innocent.”
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
“and
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
rather
impractical
for
you
to
render
a
fair
and
impart
a
verdict
based
solely
upon
the
evidence?”
“that's
right.”
mr.
theodore
lockyear
challenged
for
cause.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
on
page
21,
the
defendant
challenged
the
juror
for
cause,
cause
being
then
he
could
not
render
an
impartial
verdict
based
solely
upon
the
evidence
and
he
has
a
fixed
thing
that
would
require
evidence
rule.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
court's
ruling
would
be
right
after
that,
your
honor.
that
would
be
on
page
36
to
58
of
the
transcript.
it's
not
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
and
then
to
show
that
these
were
not
answers
given
strictly
to
the
defense
counsel,
mr.
mcgregor
asked
the
question
for
the
state.
“i
mean
your
opinion,
could
it
be
disregarded
by
you?”
he
says,
“only
by
evidence.”
“only
by
evidence?”
answer,
“that
is
right,
sir.”
and
then
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me
and
turn
to
page
30
of
our
brief
and
starting
about
a
third
down.
“and
whether
or
not
this
opinion
that
you
have
formed,”
and
this
is
still
juror
ernest
hensley.
“and
whether
or
not
this
opinion
that
you
formed
and
expressed
as
to
the
defendant
was
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
particular
crime
charged
just
in
my
own
mind.”
“that's
right.”
in
that
opinion,
you
also
formed
--“
mr.
theodore
lockyear
page
30,
your
honor.
that's
right.
“in
the
opinion
--
in
that
opinion,
you
also
formed
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
the
defendant
confessed
to
this
particular
crime.”
“well,
i
don't
know
whether
i
said
that
or
not,
but
i
understand
from
the
papers
that
he
did.”
question,
“you
have
the
opinion
that
he
did
confess
to
the
crime?”
“that's
right.”
“and
you
have
the
opinion
that
he
confessed
to
other
crimes?”
“i
believe
so.”
“and
you
have
an
opinion
that
the
defendant
shot,
killed,
and
murdered
kerr?
and
that's
for
the
crime
in
which
he
is
charged,
isn't
that
right?”
“yes,
sir.
that's
right.”
question,
“and
you
have
formed
the
opinion
that
the
defendant
shot,
killed
and
murdered
kerr
while
the
defendant
was
perpetrating
a
robbery?”
answer,
“yes,
that's
right.”
of
course,
here,
he
changed
it.
“have
you
formed
any
opinion
as
to
affixing
on
the
penalty
in
this
case?”
“i
don't
know
what
i
did.
i
just
formed
that
as
the
one
law.”
mr.
theodore
lockyear
as
i
recall,
he
was
a
farmer.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
i
could
read
out
the
jurors
who
testified
similarly
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
it
is
our
position
and
under
the
decision
in
baker
versus
(inaudible),
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
that
a
conviction
based
upon
the
testimony
of
such
a
juror
is
void
and
that
the
conviction
is
of
no
effect
that
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
only
thing,
your
honor.
they
did
consider
the
questions
as
evidence
for
what
i
read
to
the
court
a
while
ago.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
we
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
did
comfort
with
the
fact
that
this
man
has
never
been
charged
with
an
escape.
the
--
escape
if
any
is
a
separate
crime.
now,
why
this
man
was
not
in
custody,
we
know
not.
the
record
does
not
show.
we
do
know
that
this
man
has
never
been
tried
with
an
--
for
an
escape,
never
been
charged.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
state
has
a
remedy
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
man
is
an
awfully
out
of
the
custody
of
the
sheriff,
or
whether
he
--
by
insanity
or
other
means
was
out
of
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
at
that
time.
and
we
take
the
position
here
that
the
conviction
causes
a
serious
deprivation
to
this
man's
constitutional
right.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
a
letter
to
me,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
we
felt
that
--
i
received
the
letter
and
we
felt
it
our
duty
to
file
a
letter
with
the
court.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
he
says
that
i
know
this
is
a
wrong
thing
to
do
and
that
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
now,
that's
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
there
are
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
there
are
three
others
who
we
feel
would
require
evidence.
there
are
four
others
who
were
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
four
others
who
were
of
the
opinion
or
the
impression
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
being
charged,
a
total
of
8.now
admittedly,
four
of
them
i
think
are
qualified
generally
speaking
because
they
had
no
fixed
opinion
and
no
impression
that
the
man
was
guilty
of
this
crime.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
our
opinion
is
that
a
man
who
says
that
is
an
--
as
a
statement
of
fact
that
he
believes
this
defendant
guilty.
and
then
later
says
that
the
--
that
he
can
set
that
opinion
aside
or
that
he
would
disregard
that
opinion,
is
merely
the
statement
of
an
opinion,
and
therefore
permits
the
juror
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
qualified
rather
than
the
court
determining
whether
or
not
the
man
is
qualified.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right.
and
that
was
a
similar
statute
that
was
involved
in
julie
versus
united
states
case
down
in
georgia.
but
the
court
there
said
that
in
--
under
circumstances
such
as
that
where
a
juror
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
and
has
expressed
that
opinion
would
require
evidence
to
remove
it
that
he
is
not
qualified
even
under
a
similar
statute.
and
that
is
our
position
that
a
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
i
think
you
can
under
certain
--
certain
circumstances
and
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no,
we
attack
the
--
whether
or
not
this
man
had
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
we
claim
that
he
did
not
have
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right.
but
when
you
have
eight
of
them
who
are
in
the
opinion
that
he
is
guilty
before
the
trial
even
starts.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
in
some
total
and
in
any
one
individual,
one
of
them,
we
think
is
sufficient.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
it's
not
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
but
judge
parkinson
in
the
district
court
did
consider
them.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
from
now
the
finality
of
the
punishment
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
well,
we
--
and
we
feel
that
the
decision
in
this
court
in
allen
versus
georgia
is
in
our
favor
in
this
cause
because
it
said,
in
denying
in
that
particular
instance,
they
might
in
the
right
to
appeal
because
he
was
doing
this
in
the
status
of
an
escapee
at
the
time
his
case
was
dismissed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
held
that
he
could
only
be
on
a
very
exceptional
circumstances
as
this
court
would
be
--
feel
justified
in
saying
there
had
been
a
fair
legal
process.
the
plaintiff
in
there
must
have
established
--
been
deprived
of
one
of
those
fundamental
rights,
the
observance
of
which
is
in
dismissible
to
the
liberty
of
the
citizen
to
justify
and
affirm.
and
we
feel
uncertain
in
this
case
or
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
it's
allen
versus
georgia.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
we
have
no
remedy
in
the
state.
they
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
admitted.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
in
the
light
in
the
allen
case,
we
feel
this
is
one
of
the
exceptional
cases
that
they
didn't
refer
to.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no,
because
as
he
mentioned
here
as
to
habeas
corpus.
habeas
corpus
is
available
in
--
in
the
state
of
indiana
in
only
four
counties.
that
is
the
county
in
which
you
were
incarcerated
and
tried.
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
is
only
available
in
those
instances
which
appear
outside
of
the
court
--
court's
record.
and
all
of
the
questions
which
we
have
raised
are
--
appear
in
the
record
of
the
court.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
no,
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
habeas
corpus
or
coram
nobis.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
not
covered
with
the
fact
that
they
did
hear
us
on
the
merits
of
the
thing.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear
well,
i
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
the
court
is
that,
it
is
our
position
that
a
conviction
based
upon
this
various
deprivation
on
this
constitutional
right
is
void
and
that's
the
language
used
by
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
holding
--
he
says
that
his
conviction
where
a
man
is
deprived
due
process
law,
in
the
selection
of
jury,
or
in
the
--
and
it
denied
a
