mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen.
mr.
lockyear
and
i
participated
in
this
trial
as
pauper's
attorneys
appointed
for
the
lower
court
in
gibson
county
at
the
time
of
this
hearing.
i'd
like
to
review
just
a
little
bit
about
this
so-called
appeal
filed
in
a
motion
such
as
that.
mr.
lockyear
and
i
spent
four
weeks
picking
this
jury,
approximately
one
week
in
trying
the
case.
after
the
case
was
tried,
there
was
a
finding
of
guilty
and
sentence
was
passed.
and
then
we
spent
approximately
30
days
in
preparing
our
motion
for
a
new
trial.
we
went
to
gibson
county
that
particular
morning.
and
there,
we
had
--
we
learned
from
the
sheriff
that
the
lieutenant
was
not
present.
mr.
lockyear
and
i
nevertheless
filed
our
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
the
record
was
--
showed
to
be
the
filing
of
the
same

page

and
now
said

filed

the

and
now,
irvin

that

the
sheriff

the

then
at
the
time
of
the
overruling
of

the
entry

advisement,

overrules
the

which
ruling
of

the

accept.
now,
that
part
of
the
book
entry
shows
no
reason
why
the
court
overruled
it.
it
doesn't
say
because
he
has
escaped
or
because
he
was
gone

not

or
nothing

it's

mr.

was
there

your
honor,
i
will
have
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
indiana
supreme
court
record
itself,
their
opinion.
it
says
here
he

expertly
defended

point
in

415

mr.

they
were
argued.
briefs
were
filed
in
the
court.
after
the
defendant
was
apprehended,
brought
back
into
the
custody
of
the
court,
judge
eby
appointed
mr.
lockyear
and
i
as
pauper
attorneys
for
the
purpose
of
appealing
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
we
accepted
that
job.
we
prepared
briefs
and
they
were
submitted
to
the
court
in
indianapolis.
the
case
was
argued.
the
briefs
reserved
on
the
attorney
general
and
everything
was
in
due
form
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
those
briefs
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
the

the
supreme
court
granted
us
further
time
to
file
our
assignment

the
supreme

granted
us
further
time
to
do
that.
mr.

no,
irvin
had
been
apprehended.
he
was
back
in
custody.
he's
only
gone
about
three
weeks.
and
we
went
to
the
supreme
court,
we
filed
our
petition
for
an
extension
of
time
to
file
our
transcript
and
assignment
of
error,
and
they
granted
that.
mr.
james
d.

yes,
he
was
back
in
custody
now.
mr.

they
took
it
up.
mr.

mr.

yes.
mr.

after
irvin
was
back
in
custody,
judge
eby
then
appointed
mr.
lockyear
and
i
as
the
attorneys
to
appeal
this
case.
so,
the
first
thing
we
did
was
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
got
an
extension
of
time
to
file
our
transcript
and
assignment
of
errors
because
it
would
be
impossible
with
such
a
large
transcript
here,
5000
pages,
to
do
that.
they
granted
that
extension
of
time.
now,
all
through
the
stage
here,
there's
never
been
any
objections,
no
motions
to
dismiss
that
appeal
and
the
supreme
court
heard
it
on
its
merit
and
one
other
particular
--
mr.
james
d.
lopp
they
most
certainly
did
know.
we
had
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court's
office
there.
and
i
believe
this
gentleman
would
be
honest
enough
to
--
to
admit
to
this
court
that
they
did,
at
that
time,
call
to
the
supreme
court's
attention,
and
the
supreme
court
went
and
decided
the
matter
and
permitted
us
to
file
--
give
us
time
to
file
our
briefs,
isn't
that
right?
as
extension
of
time.
mr.

they
sure
did.

now
--
and
another
thing
--
mr.
james

yes,
to
appeal
--
to
appeal
a
case
in
the
state
of
indiana,
as
--
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
important,
the
same
as
the
evidence
that
you're
going
to
appeal
on
or
whatever
it
maybe.
but
to
institute
an
appeal
in
the
state
of
indiana,
it's
not
necessary
a
condition
precedent
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
to
file
a
--
to
file
an
appeal
you
file
a
praecipe
in
our
court.
the
filing
of
a
praecipe
is
the
first
step
to
get
an
appeal.
then
when
you
file
a
praecipe,
then
the
next
thing
to
do
is
to
file
your
assignment
of
errors
with
the
supreme
court
and
transcript.
your
assignment
of
errors
is
the
same
as
your
complaint.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
no,
never
filed
that
in
person.
he
couldn't
have.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
the
--
yes,
that's
true.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
did.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
the
state
of
indiana
asked
for
an
extension
of
time
to
file
their
briefs
and
the
court
gave
them
an
extension
of
time
to
file
their
briefs
and
by
virtue
of
that,
under
our
laws,
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
they
waived
any
preliminary
motions
to
dismiss
or
otherwise
and
that
is
rule
2-16,
set
out
on
page
123
of
our
brief
and
that
--
and
that
reads
as
follows,
“the
petition,”
see,
they
filed
--
the
state
of
indiana
asked
for
an
extension
of
time
to
file
their
brief.
when
they
did
that
they
had
to
sign
this
petition
which
says
in
effect,
“the
petition
shall
state
facts
showing
that
the
court
in
which
the
cause
is
pending
has
jurisdiction
and
that
the
briefs
will
be
on
the
merits
and
when
filed
by
the
appellee,”
which
is
the
state
of
indiana's
case,
“the
petition
shall
show
that
all
motions
to
dismiss
and
all
dilatory
motions
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
have
been
filed.”
and
that's
what
the
state
of
indiana
did
in
this
case
so
this
waived
your
business
as
a
two-way
street.
the
state
of
indiana
has
waived
their
right
then
too.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
all
right
it
would
have
to
be
discretionary
with
the
court
but
in
this
particular
--
mr.
james
d.
lopp
the
appeal
sets
out
assignment
of
error.
ordinarily,
the
assignment
of
error
is
the
overruling
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
but
once
it
gets
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
the
supreme
court
can
search
the
record
for
any
kind
of
error
to
determine
the
case
whether
or
not
there
was
error
and
that's
exactly
what
they
did
in
this
case,
and
they
did
search
this
record.
and
in
their
opinion,
of
course,
there
was
no
error.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
that's
right.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
they
are
of
record.
mr.
james
d.

well,
right.
this

so
there's

that's
exactly
what
happened.
mr.

i'll
try
to
answer
that.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
first,
we
--
when
we
were
appointed
to
represent
this
defendant,
we
went
to
the
supreme
court
with
a
petition
for
an
extension
of
time
to
file
our
transcript
and
assignment
of
errors.
the
attorney
general's
office
more
or
less
objected
because
he
had
escaped.
the
supreme
court
heard
that
and
granted
us
the
right
to
--
to
--
mr.
james
d.
lopp
--
file
that.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
that's
right.
then
we
filed
our
briefs,
then
the
attorney
general
felt
that
he
didn't
have
time
or
something
to
file
his
brief
so
he
went
to
the
supreme
court
and
asked
the
supreme
court
for
an
extension
of
time
to
file
his
briefs.
now,
as
a
condition
precedent
before
you
can
get
an
extension
of
time
to
file
briefs,
you
have
to
follow
this
rule
of
court
to
day
16
which
you
have
to
set
out
that
you
waived,
that
you
admit
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
you
waived
all
rights
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
mr.
james

that
was
done
by
the
state
of
indiana's
attorney
general.
mr.

mr.

they
asked
for
an
extension

time.
and
that's
the
only
way
you
can
get
an
extension
of
time
by
stating
in
your
petition
that
you
admit
the
court
