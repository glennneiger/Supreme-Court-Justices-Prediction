justice
william
o.
douglas
this
happened
at
the
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
as
i
read
your
supreme
court
decisions
(inaudible)
february
1957,
it
goes
on
two
grounds.
one,
that
the
defendant
being
a
fugitive.
he
has
no
right
to
move
for
a
new
trial
while
he
was
in
that
status
of
fugitive.
and
secondly,
that
even
on
the
merits,
there
was
no
error
in
the
trial
below.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you
have
--
you
have
two
grounds,
not
a
denial
of
all
relief
but
a
grant
of
--
of
the
relief
in
the
form
of
review
on
the
merits
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
indiana
supreme
court.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
so
far
as
the
merits
of
this
--
of
these
questions,
you're
now
presenting,
in
one
--
in
one
sense
of
the
word,
you
--
you
did
get
--
you
did
exhaust
the
state
remedy
by
getting
a
review
on
the
merits
of
the
errors
unless
it's
a
criminal
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
you
may.
very
well.
mr.
givan,
you
may
proceed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
--
as
i
recall,
it
was
the
escape
pending
trial,
was
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
before
arraignment,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
after
saying
all
that,
the
supreme
court
did
go
ahead
and
reviewed
the
case
on
the
merits?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
they
said
was,
“we
have
--
because
of
finality
of
the
sentence,
we
have
reviewed
the
evidence
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
there's
no
miscarriage
of
justice
in
this
case.”
then
they
go
on
to
review
the
--
the
matter
as
you
know
point
my
point.
