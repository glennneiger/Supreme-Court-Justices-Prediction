e.
dowd,
warden
of
the

of
indiana
prison.
mr.
lockyear,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
confession
concerning
which
the
prosecutor
testified
reduced
to
writing
at
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
his
memory,
his
recollection.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
at
the
trial
not
in
the
preliminary
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
--
any
reason
given
by
the
court
as
to
--
to
why
that
was
not
admissible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
when
a
--
when
the
response
was
that
he
didn't
say
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
supreme
court
comment
on
--
on
this
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
put
the
facts
chronologically
that
we
might
get
it
in
our
minds
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
--
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly,
because
at
the
moment
we're
all
talking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
--
that's
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
an
--
an
issue
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you'd
better
--
you'd
better
state
all
the
facts
there
in
issue
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
his
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see
it
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
--
there's
some
more
following
that
that
i
think
is
rather
significant,
would
you
read
that
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
this
you're
reading
from
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
away
from
that
jury
question.
how
many
other
jurors
whether
who
--
were
in
a
comparable
position
to
this
one
that
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
tell
us
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
addition
to
that,
four?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
have
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
i
was
going
to
ask
you
anyway.
tell
me
what
--
what
he
said
--
mr.
wever
said
about
the
confession
itself?
did
he
repeat
the
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
confession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
referred
to
the
confession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
argue
the
credibility
of
his
own
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
givan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lopp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
those
argued
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
it
appear
in
that
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
this,
did
--
what
--
was
this
--
was
this
merely
an
oral
presentation
before
the
supreme
court
or
was
that
brief
filed
and
whether
oral
or
briefs,
did
the
state
of
indiana
in
asking
for
an
extension
of
time
at
the
same
time
insist
on
the
jurisdictional
ground
that
they're
now
taking,
namely,
that
the
escape
had
constituted
a
waiver
of
the
right
of
filing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
can
see
that
both
the
briefs
of
both
sides
are
--
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
filed.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
refer
to
which,
your
honor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
givan,
would
you
mind
telling
us
if
the
state
did
invoke
rule
2-16
and
if
so,
what
the
effect
of
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
invoke.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
couldn't
ask
the
court
to
dismiss
after
availing
yourself
of
2-16,
could
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you're
bound
by
this
language
in
2-16,
“the
petition
shall
state
the
fact
showing
that
the
court
in
which
the
cause
is
pending
has
jurisdiction
and
that
the
brief
will
be
on
the
merits.
when
filed
by
the
appellee,
the
petition
shall
show
that
all
motions
to
dismiss
and
all
dilatory
motions
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
had
been
filed.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
had
filed
none.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
bound
by
that
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
i
--
i
would
--
i
--
i
want
to
thank
you,
mr.
lockyear
and
mr.
lopp
for
--
for
having
undertaken
the
defense
of
this
--
this
impecunious
defendant.
you've
had
a
long
journey
all
through
state
courts
and
through
the
federal
courts,
and
it's
a
great
comfort
to
the
court
to
know
that
men
will
--
will
do
that
out
of
respect
to
their
public
obligations
as
counsel
and
without
--
without
obligation,
i
mean,
without
compensation.
unfortunately,
the
whole
american
public
doesn't
--
doesn't
understand
that
lawyers
do
--
do
that.
we
always
appreciate
it.
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
givan,
we
want
to
thank
you
for
your
very
able
presentation
of
--
of
the
case
of
the
state
of
indiana.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
appreciate
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
think
we
better
have
them,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
copy
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
will
just
leave
it
with
the
clerk
and
--
and
if
they
have
one,
they
can
do
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
don't
do
anymore
printing
or
anything
that
--
i
just
--
just
let
us
have
the
briefs
that
are
available
or
what's
available.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
