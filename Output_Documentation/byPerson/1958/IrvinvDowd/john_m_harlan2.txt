justice
john
m.
harlan
with
--
with
reference
to
what
subject
matter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
indiana
law,
despite
this
escape,
the
ground
in
which
the
--
your
court
put
it,
would
they
have
had
a
right
in
their
discretion
to
hear
the
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
misunderstood
my
question.
my
question
is,
the
state
board
of
indiana
held
they
could
not
reach
the
merits
to
the
class
of
case.
(inaudible)
indiana
supreme
court.
he
had
no
right
to
the
cases.
that
is
a
proper
--
on
the
state
ground.
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
what
you
rely
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
would
--
wouldn't
the
supreme
court's
opinion
at
least
indicate
this
much.
if
they
had
filed
this,
there
had
been
a
serious
violation
to
this
man's
constitutional
rights.
it's
non-constant
to
their
escapee
rule,
they
would
have
had
power
to
review
it.
it
indicates
that
much,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
--
so
that
really,
you
--
you
would
agree
then
that
what
they
in
effect
did
was
to
say,
â€œafter
looking
at
this
record
ourselves,
we
do
not
consider
this
as
a
case
where
we
have
to
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
we
should
or
should
not
exercise
our
discretion
the
way
of
our
own
state
rule.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
considered
a
little
more
to
that.
they
said
that
this
being
a
final
--
final
judgment
as
they
call
it,
capital
case.
they'd
scrutinized
the
record
and
that
they
reached
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
substance
for
the
constitution
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
if
you
take
it
at
face
value,
that
he
did
a
conscientious
job
on
what
the
record
satisfy
themselves
before
they
hear
it
to
their
state
ground,
state
rule
that
there
was
not
a
violation
of
constitutional
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
to
go
that
far,
surely.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
of
the
431
jurors
that
were
originally
called
for
excuse
by
the
court
because
they
formed
fixed
opinions
about
the
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
over
200?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
opinion
written
by
the
trial
courts,
reasons
for
denying
a
continuance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
is
the
victim
of
this
murder?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
connection
with
the
robbery,
was
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
at
that
time,
when
you
got
an
extension
of
time
to
file
your
record,
i
suppose
the
supreme
court
didn't
know
that
this
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
--
could
you
appeal
under
your
state
practice
without
filing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
this.
assuming
you
had
appealed
directly
from
the
judgment
instead
of
filing
--
without
filing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
what
would
your
local
rule
then
be
as
to
the
right
of
the
court
to
entertain
that
appeal
even
though
the
defendant
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction,
he'd
escaped
or
he
was
not
present
at
the
time
the
appeal
was
filed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
rule
--
is
the
rule
different
in
respect
to
the
appeal
from
an
order
for
a
new
trial
or
than
it
is
when
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question,
if
it's
all
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
from
what
you
just
told
justice
frankfurter,
the
state's
position
in
effect
was
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal,
we
urge
you
to
affirm
this
case
on
two
grounds.
number
one,
that
the
court,
trial
court
properly
denied
the
motion
because
this
man
was
an
escapee
and
number
two,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
constitutional
--
this
man's
constitutional
rights,
is
that
what
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
just
what
the
supreme
court
did,
adopt
both
of
your
position,
didn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then,
don't
you
consider
that
the
--
the
second
branch
of
its
decision
was
an
alternate
ground
of
holding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
didn't
dismiss
the
appeal,
did
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
affirmed.
