of
what
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
you
mean
that
in
his
summation,
he
tried
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
persuade
the
jury
that
it
must
have
been
voluntary
because
he
is
the
one
who
testified
to
have
a
witness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

any
of
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
tell
us,
might
want
to
disrupt
your
argument,
but
you
said
there
was
an
issue
of
the
voluntariness
in
that
statement,
that
all
statements
of
the
prosecutor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
--
it
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
made
an
offer
--
you
made
an
offer
of
proof
as
--
in
the
sense
that
you
offered
to
prove
facts
which
--
to
establish
it
was
not
a
voluntary
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
that,
in
the
--
on
the
trial
cause
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
never
reached
any
of
these
constitutional
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
makes
a
disposition
on
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
disposition
on
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
it
is
a
disposition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
on
the
merits
of
all
your
constitutional
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
--
what
(inaudible)
and
then
many
of
them
murdered
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
--
was
that
a
significant
factor
as
to
why
the
community
was
--
formed
fixed
opinions
on
something
about
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
--
is
this
the
case
on
which
the
prosecutor
went
on
to
some
radio
show
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
while
your
picketing
a
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
placards
on
the
sides
of
the
truck?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
the
one
who
was
on
the
radio
station?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
announcing
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
one
of
the
jurors
who
actually
served
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
there
a
letter
here
somewhere.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
--
what
use
was
made
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
have
recall
reading
it
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
when
i
read
this
brief
but
wasn't
there
some
kind
of
admission
in
that
letter
on
his
part
that
he
had
escaped
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
evidence
of
that
all
as
to
--
in
this
record
as
to
why
he
was
absent
to
--
to
present
the
evidence
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you're
taking
the
whole
picture,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
--
you're
not
saying
anyone
alone
establishes
lack
of
due
process.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i
--
i
wasn't
--
you
--
you
have
several
points
here,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
was,
the
community
was
inflamed
that
the
jury
wasn't
an
unbiased
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
conduct
that
you
charged
to
the
prosecutor.
and
you
say
in
some
total
of
all
those
things,
he
was
denied
a
fair
trial
and
thus,
denied
due
process,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here
under
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
although
he
filed

all
the
necessary
proscribed
(inaudible)refused
to
hear
him
but
we're
assuming
he
escaped.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
filed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
trial
court
file
a
memorandum
when
the
--
what
did
they
do?
denied
the
motion
or
dismissed
the
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
denied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
--
do
i
understand
that
on
the
chronology,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
--
that
his
actual
firing
was
on
what,
the
19th
of
january
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
was
the
30th
day,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
was
brought
back
from
california
on
what
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
several
weeks
within
the
couple
of
months,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
if
i
understand
you.
had
the
trial
judge
not
acted
on
the
23rd,
four
days
later,
but
had
simply
sat
on
the
motion
and
held
it
until
after
--
for
eight
or
nine
weeks,
the
issue
we
now
--
that
now
confronts
us
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
you're
telling
me
that
if
that
had
been
in
the
situation
under
indiana
law,
your
indiana
supreme
court,
i
would
then
have
passed
upon
all
the
--
or
rather
the
trial
judge
would
have
passed
upon
the
motion,
would
he
not,
on
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
where
--
i
think
you
told
us
that
this
rule
not
to
hear
such
motions
when
the
applicant
has
escaped.
it
is
a
rule
of
the
supreme
court,
is
it?
i
mean,
well,
how
is
that
recorded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
case
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
please
tell
me,
how
many
of
these
murders
were
alleged
to
have
been
committed
in
--
in
indiana?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
all
this
publicity,
those
headlines
you
shown
before
was
murder
of
six
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
confessed
to
six
murders
and
all
that
stuff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
know
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
read
anything
else
from
the
headlines
that
were
shown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
questionable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
what
was
this?
a
--
a
nightly
broadcast
while
the
trial
was
going
on,
interviews
and
what
happened
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
statute
provides
a
standard
guide
for
the
judges'
determinations
different
from
what
the
standard
would
be
without
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
almost
across
the
street
for
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
the
last
of
this
series
of
alleged
murder
for
this
trial
murder?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
continued
from
april
through
the
time
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
from
--
from
the
examinations
of
this
jury
panel
it
certainly
took
hold
and
stop?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
don't
you
think
that's
a
questionable
thing
for
the
attorney
who
was
trying
the
case
for
the
state
to
argue
the
jury
after
he's
testified?
you
must
believe
me
because
i
said
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
--
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
the
effect
of
it
on
this
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
