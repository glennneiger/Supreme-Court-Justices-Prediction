justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
was
this
person
you
referred
to
an
official
at
that
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
allowed
to
take
the
witness
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
a
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
--
is
it
one
of
your
propositions
that
that
in
and
of
itself
violates
due
process
for
a
prosecutor
to
be
a
witness?
i'm
quite
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
highly
undesirable
thing
to
do
for
a
lawyer
in
the
case
to
be
a
witness.
but
is
that
in
and
--
is
--
is
it
your
contention?
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
--
that
that
in
and
of
itself
or
in
connection
with
other
things
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
mere
fact
that
the
prosecutor
takes
the
stand
would
not
in
and
of
itself
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
--
maybe
that's
the
right
thing
to
do.
but
suppose
he
doesn't,
will
that
in
and
of
itself
be
a
violation
of
due
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
interesting.
you
said,
the
court
refused
to
have
that
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
--
that
a
statement
was
made
in
summing
the
jury
by
the
prosecutors,
summed
up.
and
because
of
it,
he
made
a
statement.
that
was
taken
down
by
the
particular
sentence
which
you
deemed
important,
was
excised,
was
not
allowed
to
be
incorporated
in
the
stenographic
minutes?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
is
not
a
part
--
so
that
it
is
part
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
all
this
before
the
court
--
supreme
court
of
indiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
take
any
note
of
what
you've
just
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
--
i
should
have
mentioned
--
noticed
but
i
don't.
where
was
this
trial
and
what's
in
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
big
a
town
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
will
(inaudible)
begin
at
the
beginning
and
go
right
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
isn't
--
are
you
raising
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
the
record
include
a
--
of
a
--
in
case
there's
no
copies
of
--
filed
on
the
papers
to
show
the
unclaimed
state
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
date
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
he
arraigned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
this
kind
of
thing
continuing
in
the
--
what
is
it,
the
evansville?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
was
--
was
that
kind
of
inflamed
exploitation
of
a
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
continues?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
that
is
before
us
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
we
got
a
copy
of
the
actual
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
what
--
what
was
actually
said
by
him
over
the
radio?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
the
full
text
of
what
the
prosecutors
said
is
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lockyear,
the
--
if
that's
all
that
was
said
--
that's
the
full
utterance
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
i
take
it,
the
significance
is
that
what
you
have
italicized
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely
in
his
statement
of
the
unusual
coverage
given
to
the
case
by
the
newspapers,
it
made
it
difficult
to
get
an
unbiased
jury.
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
size
of
what
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
that
--
i
don't
think
i
can
quite
go
that
far.
you
make
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
what
has
caused
us
so
much
trouble
in
getting
a
jury
of
people
who
are
not
unbiased
and
are
unprejudiced.
you
can
go
on
and
argue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
what
he
did
but
he
says
the
opposite.
is
this
the
--
is
--
is
that
a
more
or
less
customary
thing
for
a
prosecutor
to
be
talking
to
the
community
while
the
case
goes
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
would
you
mind
telling
us,
unless
it
appears,
what
juror
hensley's
occupation
or
profession
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
a
farmer.
that
business
associates
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
you're
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
have
you
no
remedy
on
the
state
court
because
under
state
law,
an
escapee,
ugly
word,
can't
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
putting
to
--
putting
that
one
side
if
you
can
establish
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
did
in
fact
although
by
their
own
law,
they
were
not
required
to.
they
did
in
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
it
was
waived
that
he
couldn't
appeal
because
he
is
a
known
escapee,
they
went
ahead.
that's
one
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
put
that
to
one
side
and
face
the
question,
do
you
have
to
face
the
question
that
justice
harlan
put
and
that
justice
stewart
suggested
you
should
deal
with,
namely,
is
it
violative
of
due
process
for
a
state
to
say
that
the
convicted
defendant
cannot
raise
errors
that
may
have
vitiate
that
otherwise
would
have
vitiated
the
sentence
if
he
escaped
after
the
sentence
and
before
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
dealt
with
that
problem
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
normally
--
normally,
you
can't
come
into
a
federal
court.
you
can
come
here
directly
from
a
state
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
to
which
an
appeal
lies
in
a
criminal
case.
you
can't
get
into
the
federal
court
--
lower
federal
courts
until
you
go
on
through
the
state
process.
now,
the
question
is,
the
state
process
is
available
for
raising
all
these
questions.
but
if
the
state
says,
“a
fellow
doesn't
take
the
lawful
task
of
having
us,
the
supreme
court,
passed
on
that
but
run
the
way,
is
he
barred
for
raising
these
questions?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
novel
question.
this
court
have
to
consider
in
the
case
of
eisler.
what
we
should
do
with
an
appeal
for
a
fellow
who
escaped
or
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
there
is
a
remedy
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that
is
was
waived.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
it
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
because
of
the
escape?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
raises
the
--
i
hope
you
will
address
yourself
to
this
as
to
--
to
that
a
problem.
namely,
it
really
gets
down
--
by
the
way,
that
--
that's
a
rule
of
your
court,
isn't
it?
that's
not
a
statute
that
an
escapee
has
no
right
of
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
very
well.
so
this
is
--
is
the
law
of
indiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please
consider
the
unavailability
of
a
remedy
to
an
escapee,
although
confess
it
or
concede
it
for
purposes
of
the
argument?
there
may
have
been
denial
of
--
of
constitutional
right
of
united
states
constitutional
rights
at
the
trial
resulting
in
the
burden.
will
you
please
consider
that
question
that
--
because
escape
cuts
off
the
opportunity
to
review
those
in
the
state
court,
and
therefore,
bringing
into
play,
the
non-exhaustion
of
state
remedy.
will
you
please
consider
that
in
connection
with
the
mooney
decision
of
this
court,
that
although
a
state
may
not
affor
relief
for
subsequently
proved
prejudice,
these
are
all
the
record.
if
the
state
doesn't
give
such
relief,
such
relief
may
be
had
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
a
later
case
--
later
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
a
later
case
in
which
--
and
even
a
murder
case
was
filed
a
day
too
late.
and
this
court
said,
“that's
too
bad
but
we
can't
do
anything
about
it.”
and
that
was
a
very
strange
decision
but
there
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
part
of
brown
and
allen?
you
mean
the
exhaustion
of
remedy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
aren't
we
sort
of
--
well,
using
an
undistributed
middle
when
you
say
he
hasn't
exhausted
his
remedy
when
he
couldn't
exhaust
it.
but
there's
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
non-exhaustion
of
a
remedy
that
isn't
opened
and
he
could
have
it
if
he
haven't
--
if
he
haven't
been
an
escapee.
but
the
state
says
an
escapee
can't
avail
himself
of
this
remedy.
they
say
it's
--
that's
non-exhaustion.
that's
inability
to
exhaust
but
it
is
non-exhaustion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
explains
why
in
indiana,
you
provide
--
he
has
no
remedy
by
a
virtue
of
habeas
corpus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
explain
why
he's
shut
out
from
having
these
constitutional
questions
considered
by
your
supreme
court,
except
on
the
ground
that
he's
an
escapee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
well
understand
and
i
have
no
trouble
what
the
state
say
that
you
can't
raise
on
the
habeas
corpus
but
you
could've
raised
on
appeal.
but
here,
he
couldn't
have
raised
it
on
appeal.
he
wasn't
allowed
to
raise
it
rather
because
he
is
an
escapee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
hasn't
been
an
escapee,
he
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
do
not
deny
the
right
of
appeal
to
a
convicted
defendant
merely
because
he
escapes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
supposing
--
may
i
ask
this
for
me
to
clarify.
suppose
he
hadn't
escaped
and
he
just
let
the
time
run.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
question
is,
then
could
a
man
at
the
time
run,
moore
--
brown
and
allen
was
a
case
where
i
believe
--
who
i
believe,
negligence
of
counsel.
there's
a
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
until
the
31st
day.
and
this
court
held
there
it
is
that
--
that
the
state
may
put
a
limitation
upon
the
time
where
the
mentioned
appeal
may
be
taken.
now,
if
this
fellow
haven't
escaped
and
he
let
the
30
days
run,
you
would
say,
“you
haven't
availed
yourself
of
the
procedural
provisions
that
state
makes
for
an
appeal.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
is
whether
the
fact
that
he
has
escaped
puts
him
in
a
more
favorable
position
than
if
he
hasn't
escaped.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
that
--
then
we
--
we
have
to
take
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
four.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
in
fact
--
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't.
was
there
in
fact
on
the
test
made
by
counsel
on
behalf
of
irvin
to
come
within
the
30-day
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
there
was
a
compliance
with
the
state
law
where
some
nugatory
by
the
fact
that
he
was
an
escapee,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
the
different
situation
from
brown
and
allen.
there
was
a
meeting
that
--
that
the
state
requirement
was
met.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
indiana
supreme
court
says,
“it
isn't
met
because
we
don't
entertain
an
appeal
while
the
fellow
has
escaped.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
do
i
understand
you
said
there's
no
case.
i
mean
you
just
made
the
statement,
that
if
he
comes
back
within
the
30
days,
the
appeal
would
have
been
entertained,
the
motion
for
new
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
therefore,
that's
supposed
to
mean
whether
--
although
on
his
behalf,
proper
steps
were
taken
within
the
time,
and
eventually,
did
come
back.
is
that
all
(inaudible)
by
--
by
the
fact
that
while
the
steps
were
taken,
he
was
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
that's
really
the
--
we'll
get
down
to
that
narrow
point
in
the
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
trial
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
trial
court
had
done
what
this
court
did
in
eisler,
held
the
case,
hadn't
ruled
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
he
held
it
without
--
suppose
there
had
been
no
cut
off
within
the
statutory
period
and
then
irvin
would
have
come
back.
would
you
be
here
on
your
--
on
your
understanding
of
indiana
law
saying
that
he
had
no
right
of
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
submitted
in
the
heisler
case.
that's
what
the
court
did
in
the
beginning.
suppose
it's
this
court
and
heisler
escaped
--
is
this
heisler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
eisler
escaped,
this
court
then
just
held
the
appeal
which
has
been
--
about
to
rely
after
what
we
saw.
now,
suppose
your
--
your
courts
have
done
that,
held
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
has
been
a
proper
--
a
proper
availing
of
the
local
remedy
within
the
time
the
court
held
this
and
then
irvin
returned
after
the
filing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
have
--
you
would
--
you
would
indicate
that
--
you
indicate
that
you
wouldn't
then
make
the
point
you're
now
making,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
consideration
isn't
it?
you
--
you
can't
get
away
from
the
fact
if
they
considered
the
merits
and
the
only
one.
on
the
merits,
a
man
was
not
entitled
to
get
out,
not
entitled
to
(inaudible).
isn't
that
what
they
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
--
i'd
like
to
infer
from
what
you've
just
said
that
what
it
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
about
juror
(inaudible)
is
not
a
representative
portion
of
the
examination
of
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
36
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
originals
here
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
36
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
expressed
that
--
expressed
that
under
the
statute
of
indiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
anything
--
it
is
(inaudible)
are
we
special
about
indiana
statute
as
qualifications
of
jurors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
--
how
long
was
the
total
examination
of
jurors
before
the
jury
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
four
weeks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
we
can
get
a
jury
in
one
week
to
get
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
--
to
spread
out
before
the
community,
out
of
which
impartial
men
are
to
be
selected
what
is
or
may
not
be
prudent
or
may
not
be
allowed
to
be
prudent
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
center
of
that
civilization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
a
man
was
indicted
he's
charged
and
visited
his
lawyer
and
he
plead
--
and
he's
arraigned
and
he's
going
to
be
tried.
and
that's
a
fair
account
of
what
takes
place.
that's
the
news.
all
the
rest
is
--
is
exploitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
not
just
a
speculation
not
exploitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

restrained
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
first
choice,
mr.
attorney
general,
and
that
is
a
change
in
venue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it

they
did
have
a
hearing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
court
en
banc,
the
whole
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lopp,
this
proceeding
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
on
which
you
predicate
states
waiver
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
satisfying
the
requirements
for
(inaudible)
there
must
be
a
matter
of
some
records,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
are
they
(inaudible)
you
give
us
the
references
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
certified
copy
of

justice

frankfurter
(voice

or
whatever
you
call
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

of

justice
felix

and
that's
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
of
that
entry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
oral
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
already
heard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
they
explicitly
--
that
they
explicitly
brought
themselves
within
your
rule
2-16?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
explicitly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
invoking
rule
2-16
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
they
asked
for
an
extension
of
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
--
you
tendered
the
merits
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
appeal
properly
before
the
supreme
court
and
you
didn't
stand
head
on
such
a
position
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
could
the
appeal
be
properly
there
if
--
if
the
appellant
didn't
bring
himself
within
the
30-day
or
whatever
the
rule
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
or
the
supreme
court
tendered
the
merits,
meaning
the
validity
of
the
confession
biased
(inaudible)
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
position
of
yours
that
you
just
stated
shed
some
light
on
why
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
went
into
the
merit
although
it
could
have
stopped
yours
if
it
has
gone
entirely
on
the
question
of
no
standing
or
whatever
you
call
it.
it
could
have
stopped
right
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
ask
you
one
more
thing
(inaudible).
i
noticed
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
there
is
no
reference
to
the
--
to
the
newspapers
or
the
enveloping
bias.
was
that
argued
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
make
no
reference
to
that
as
i
--
as
i
read
their
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
they
did
deal
with
all
the
other
courts
more
or
less,
they
dealt
with
the
wever
point,
they
dealt
with
jury
bias,
they
dealt
with
the
confession
but
they
pay
no
attention
to
their
discussions,
what
you
call
dicta
to
the
question
of
the
enveloping
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
only
one
paragraph
about
all
of
the
so-called
merits
set
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
they
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
like
what
you
just
said
about
mr.
justice
emmert.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
difficulty?
