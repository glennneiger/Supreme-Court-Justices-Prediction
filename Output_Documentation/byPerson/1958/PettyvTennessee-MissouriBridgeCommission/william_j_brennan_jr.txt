justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
even
if
the
--
that
constitute
consent
to
sue
and
be
sued,
you're
still
though
--
you
do
not
have
to
get
over
the
hurdle,
whether
there
is
any
substantive
obligation,
in
other
words
whether
the
--
there
is
any
immunity
involved
here
because
this
is
a
government
obligation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
respondent's
superior?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
that
there
--
that
there's
no
eleventh
amendment
problem
in
terms
of
your
ability
to
bring
a
suit
against
this
bi-state
agency
because
of
the
clause
that
you
referred
to,
in
other
words,
that
the
agency
might
sue
or
be
sued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
--
they're
still
involved
in
this
case.
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
agency
is
a
governmental
agency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
tort
involved
here
in
place
of
the
actions
ordinarily
if
any
respond,
they
have
the
superior
obligation
by
a
public
body
in
respect
to
the
governmental
function.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you're
drawing
a
distinction
between
proprietary
and
governmental
function.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
was
--
that's
because
of
the
maritime
law
had
taken
over,
those
distinctions
of
the
states,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
tort
submitted
by
a
fire-boat,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
a
maritime
tort.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
i
believe
the
--
i
believe
something
didn't
carry
over
the
state
distinctions
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
case
then,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
your
case
then,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
one
way
of
disposing
it
in
your
favor,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
--
you
wouldn't
abandon
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
--
what
--
you
must
see
some
problems
there
that
make
it
advisable
for
you
not
to
rest
on
--
on
that
approach.
what
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
reference
that
were
made
to
our
decision
in
the
keifer
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
those
were
respondeat
superior
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
line
with
distinction
on
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
the
tenth
--
that's
the
missouri
case,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
is
the
same
language,
given
one

and
a

meaning

(voice

the

it
