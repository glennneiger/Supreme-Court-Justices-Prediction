mr.
james
m.
reeves
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
an
article
in
1925.
it's
recorded
in
volume
34,
i
believe,
yale
law
journal.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
read
that.
it's
cited
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
but
that
article
goes
a
very
fine
historical
background
to
compacts
between
states,
has
a
beginning
way
back
in
the
early
colonial
days
when
a
colonist
had
disputed
boundary
alliance
and
all
of
that.
so,
it's
been
--
been
brought
down
to
present
day
through
provision
in
our
constitution.
that
is,
that
two
states
may
contract
with
each
other
provided
congress
gives
its
consent.
now,
this
contract
or
compact
between
tennessee
and
missouri
was
set
up
to
perform
one
function.
that
was
to
plan,
build,
and
maintain
a
bridge
at
or
near
caruthersville,
missouri
across
the
mississippi
river.
and
when
the
bridge
was
paid
for
by
the
use
of
some
toll
bonds,
income
bonds,
the
property
was
to
become
the
--
the
ownership
of
that
property
was
divested
in
two
states,
tennessee
and
missouri.
now,
the
commission
was
also
authorized
to
operate
ferries
within
a
radius
of
25
miles
off
caruthersville,
during
the
progress
of
the
planning
and
the
construction
of
this
bridge.
and
the
commission
did
obtain,
by
the
issuance
of
revenue
bonds
of
$200,000
title
to
the
--
what's
known
as
the
tiptonville
ferry,
and
that's
where
this
disaster
occurred.
an
employee
on
the
ferry
was
killed,
the
accident
happened
--
happening
in
the
mid-channel
of
the
mississippi
river.
now,
the
income
of
these
bonds
issued
and
to
be
issued
by
this
commission,
by
contract
with
the
federal
treasury
department
are
tax-free,
recognizing
that
it
is
a
governmental
agency.
not
all
of
that,
but
the
two
states
with
the
aid
of
the
federal
government
has
allocated
$100,000
to
assist
in
the
planning,
the
engineering
designs
and
so
forth
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
this
bridge.
now,
that's
the
rule,
insofar
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
all
over
the
united
states,
including
the
federal
courts
that
the
building
and
maintaining
of
bridges
and
roads
are
governmental
functions.
i
have
not
seen
anything
to
the
contrary
and
the
able
counsel
have
not
cited
anything
to
the
contrary
in
his
brief.
so,
we
start
out
here
with
this
commission.
incidentally
the
commission
was
appointed
by
the
two
governors
with
senate
--
senate
consent,
five
from
tennessee,
five
from
missouri
and
then
the
--
the
governor
of
each
state
has
veto
power
over
any
action
they
may
take.
now,
this
--
this
commission
then
was
set
up
as
an
arm
of
the
two
states
to
perform
a
governmental
function.
now,
it's
unlike
a
municipality,
that
one
member
of
the
court
mentioned
a
while
ago.
this
proprietary
or
governmental
functions,
one,
you're
liable,
and
the
other
you're
not
liable
is
brought
into
play
in
--
all
i
have
seen
in
cities,
municipalities.
that
can't
be
true
here
because
this
commission
had
no
function
to
perform
except
the
one
which
the
courts
have
held
to
be
a
governmental
function.
a
reference
has
been
made
and
admitted
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
believe,
that
there's
no
doubt
about
the
law
of
tennessee
and
missouri
with
reference
to
the
granting
of
power
to
contract
to
sue
and
be
sued,
not
giving
the
governmental
agencies
so
set
up
the
capacity
to
be
sued
in
tort
action.
we
held
--
mr.
james
m.
reeves
i
haven't
investigated
that
--
mr.
james
m.
reeves
--
rule,
but
i
think
on
principle,
the
answer
is
yes.
i
know
no
reason
why
the
sovereign
cannot
maintain
a
suit
against
an
individual
or
some
other
person
or
corporation
which
commits
a
wrong
against
this
property.
it
has
been
done,
i
do
know
that.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
if
chief
justice,
please,
i
would
not
claim
that
right
by
a
virtue
of
the
grant
of
the
power
in
the
statutory
enactment.
i
would
claim
the
right
to
bring
the
suit
because
it's
a
sovereign
and
it
has
always,
as
i
understand
it,
exercised
that
power
without
regard
to
any
statutory
enactment.
why,
of
course,
now
it's
strange
to
say
but
all
of
these
agencies
which
are
set
up
in
the
states,
and
i
think
all
of
them
without
exception,
are
granted
the
capacity
to
sue
and
be
sued.
we
have
the
state
of
highway
commission
which
is
a
--
a
commission
set
up
similar
to
this
except
it's
wholly
within
the
state
of
missouri
which
builds
all
of
our
highways.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
that's
a
crucial
question.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
whenever
a
compact
is
entered
into,
it
does
become
a
federal
question
of
interpretation.
but
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
two
contracting
parties
are
the
states
of
missouri
and
tennessee.
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
would
be
trying
to
interpret
what
they
meant
by
the
language
used
in
the
compact.
you
would
be
interpreting
the
language.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
fortunately,
we
don't
have
that
condition
here.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
i
couldn't
answer
it.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well
--
mr.
james
m.
reeves
i
think
then,
your
honor,
it
would
be
terrible
and
the
--
your
jurisdiction
to
determine.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
i
--
i
have
to
say,
i
wouldn't
know.
that's
the
question
i
haven't
investigated
because
it's
not
in
this
record.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
here,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
have
two
contracting
parties.
it
is
my
understanding
that
you
always
try
to
get
the
intent
of
the
contracting
parties.
now,
the
interpretation
of
that
consent
is
a
federal
interpretation,
but
don't
you
still
go
back
to
find
out
what
the
intent
was
when
they
entered
into
it
by
the
nature
of
their
local
laws.
now,
my
opponent
says
that
this
and
he
says
is
a
maritime
tort,
and
maritime
law
should
be
applied.
i
agree
that
it
is
maritime
in
nature
on
the
jones
act,
but
the
--
this
court
has
always
held
that
the
fact
that
an
action
is
under
the
maritime
law
or
in
admiralty
still
does
not
give
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
tort
involving
maritime
--
maritime
action.
that's
always
been
held
as
i
understand
it.
now,
the
--
you
mentioned
the
workman
case
a
moment
ago,
the
workman
case
was
what
i
was
trying
to
mention
in
my
argument
a
moment
ago.
the
workmen
case,
if
the
court
please,
was
a
suit
in
admiralty
against
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
the
court
was
very
careful
to
point
out
in
the
workman
case
that
qualify,
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction.
and
that
this
court
held
that
it
did
have
jurisdiction
for
the
reason
that
the
fire
department
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
liable
in
damages
for
negligence
and
that
was
governed
by
the
maritime
law
not
the
jurisdiction,
but
it
was
governed
by
the
maritime
law.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
indeed,
it
was
under
the
jones
act.
but
this
court
has
explained
in
the
workman
case
in
--
in
two
different
decisions
in
which
it
--
its
--
this
court
said
that
the
workman
case
did
not
mean
that
because
it
was
a
maritime
tort
that
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction.
they
didn't
mean
that
at
all
and
it
was
a
unanimous
opinion
by
this
court.
the
california
case,
the
simple
answer
to
the
california
case
is
a
fact
that
that
law,
says
it's
a
superior
sovereign
suing
an
inferior
sovereign
and
as
--
mr.
james
m.
reeves
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well
--
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well
--
well,
that's
my
own
language.
that's
--
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
quote
from
the
case,
but
what
i'm
getting
at,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
was
not
involved
because
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
the
united
states
from
suing
another
state
in
one
of
its
own
courts.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
yes.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
it
would
be
liable
at
a
suit
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
it
might
--
mr.
james
m.
reeves
--
it
might
be
but
you
haven't
held
that
it
was
liable
to
an
individual.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
correct.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
correct,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
i
haven't
seen
one
later
than
the
california
case.
but
in
the
california
case,
the
--
the
--
this
court
held
that
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction
because
the
interstate
commerce
act
applied
against
all
persons
or
corporations
and
even
the
state
if
they
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
but
they
--
they
--
you
didn't
hold
in
that
case
that
an
individual
could
sue
the
state
of
california
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
and
this
decision
by
the
state
of
california
following
your
decision
held
that
since
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
had
gone
through
the
procedure
provided
by
the
state
of
california
in
negligent
actions
that
he
had
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence,
created
by
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
but
the
state
of
california
had
given
its
consent
to
be
sued
in
this
substantive
case
subsequent
to
united
states
against
california.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
sure.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
workman
doctrine
would
not
rule
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
no,
i
didn't
mean
--
i
didn't
mean
to
make
that
admission.
he
qualified
by
asking
me
i
had
several
question,
i'd
said,
“yes.”
if,
if
--
well
then,
we
would
be
out
of
the
jones
act."
but
i
don't
concede
that
the
workman
case
has
anything
to
do
with
this
because
there,
this
court
was
interpreting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty
courts
and
applying
a
measure
of
liability,
not
a
question
of
whether
they
could
be
sued
or
not
sued
but
you
--
you
were
--
mentioned
the
--
the
question
of
liability
of
the
fire
department
for
a
tort
committed
on
the
high
seas
or
in
the
harbor
in
that
particular
case.
and
you
held
that
as
to
whether
the
fire
department
was
liable
or
not
liable
was
governed
not
by
the
local
law
of
--
of
new
york,
but
was
governed
by
the
maritime
law
because
it
was
maritime
tort.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon?
mr.
james
m.
reeves
you
held
that.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
yes.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
yes.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
no,
you
held
that
in
the
256.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
you
held
it
--
you
couldn't
sue
the
state
of
new
york
for
a
maritime
tort.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
wrong
to
say
that,
if
the
justice
please,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
liability
would
be
governed
by
the
jones
act
and
in
turn
by
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
but
it
would
be,
the
overall
governing
law
would
be
maritime
in
nature.
yes,
i
--
i
agree
to
that.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
i'm
not
questioning
that,
if
the
court
please.
there's
no
question
about
it
if
--
if
we
have
given
consent
to
be
sued,
we're
in
court.
if
we
haven't,
we're
not.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
thank
you,
but
i
believe
this
is
a
good
time
to
quit.
thank
you.
and
i
wonder
if
i
could
be
excused.
my
plane
reservation
is
at
six
o'clock.
mr.
james
m.
reeves
i
thought
--
well,
i
thought
you
mentioned
we're
going
to
finish
it
later
in
the
evening.
go
and
finish
it
now,
(inaudible)
