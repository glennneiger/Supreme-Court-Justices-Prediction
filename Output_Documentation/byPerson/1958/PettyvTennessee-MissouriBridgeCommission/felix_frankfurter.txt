justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
this
suit
in
admiralty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
congress
say
this
is
a
maritime
tort
that
if
congress
can
simply
give
members
of
the
crew
the
same
right
it
gave
since
it's
not
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
that
means
if
there
wasn't
recovery
on
the
maritime
law,
and
congress
granted
a
new
statutory
right,
that's
all
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
i
understand
your
desire
to
have
another
string
to
your
bow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
that
by
reading
the
condition
that
congress
imposed
made
part
of
its
consent
to
the
compact,
what's
the
relevance
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt
you?
did
by
congress
by
that
--
by
that
provision
condition
new
rights
or
if
--
if
they
said
nothing
that
our
contention
--
take
away
anything
that
you
got
otherwise.
that's
all
it
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
the
most
common
thing
in
laws
to
be
sure
that
you
don't
deprive
and
undo
something
that
you
don't
want
to
undo
and
this
is
just
a
nice
caveat
that
this
doesn't
change
anything
that
there
before
existed.
that's
all
i
can
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
create
any
right.
if
you
didn't
have
any
right
before
that
compact,
what
language
is
there
in
which
you
can
say,
is
the
creation
of
a
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
not
--
but
not
a
state
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
really
suggesting
that
this
proviso
more
than
affect
statement
by
congress
and
not
really
talking
about
the
workmen's
act.
that
congress
implied
and
said,
"although,
before
this
compact,
you
couldn't
be
sued
without
your
consent
and
we
now
(inaudible)"
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
you
suggesting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
rule
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
what
is
the
rule
they
gave
you?
they
say
nothing
herein
contained
shall
be
construed
to
affect
the
care
or
diminish
any
rights
by
jurisdiction
of
any
court,
(inaudible)
so
i've
look
what
the
rights
were
that
was
abridged,
not
to
say,
something
new
was
added.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
leave
--
before
you
go
on
to
the
next.
they
relied
you
said
on
the
missouri
and
tennessee
cases,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
understand
by
that
--
i
understand
that
you
are
arguing
that
in
those
two
states
--
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
it
(inaudible),
what
the
law
of
missouri
and
tennessee
is
as
to
the
scope
of
the
provision
with
reference
to
a
public
body
giving
us
the
authority
of
just
having
a
provision
(inaudible).
is
it
the
local
law
of
those
states
that
that
provision
with
the
creation
of
a
public
body
has
a
very
limited
--
locally
limited
meaning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
of
these
are
more
specific,
does
that
mean
and
i
can
infer
from
that
basing
on
the
judgment
for
me
that
in
those
states
that's
brazen
to
see
a
construction,
the
equivalent
of
which
is
the
writing
in
it,
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
contract
but
not
in
tort.
is
that
what
your
case
was
told?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
as
to
their
local
affair,
tennessee
and
missouri
could
by
the
legislature
say,
suppose
tennessee
and
missouri
by
their
legislature
say,
"when
we
all
grow
and
we
create
a
public
body
with
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued,
we
merely
waive
the
state
sovereignty
to
the
tune
of
contract
but
not
the
tort."
can
this
court
say,
“if
you
do
that,
you
must
waive
more?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
says
so
even
though
that
the
tort
involved
the
jones
act,
this
court
that
comes
to
the
united
states
can
create
a
jones
act
but
can
it
decide
to
what
extent
a
state
may
waive
its
immunity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you're
back
--
you're
back
on
your
compact.
you
have
--
you
have
to
get
a
good
deal
of
support
from
your
view,
putting
workman
on
side
from
the
way
in
which
you
read
the
proviso
and
the
compact
can
stand,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
it
more
(inaudible)
putting
workman
to
one
side
and
putting
the
limitation
which
the
states
of
tennessee
and
missouri,
on
what
you
tell
me,
have
put
upon
the
extent
to
which
they
waive
their
national
--
their
state
sovereignty.
do
you
rely
--
i
mean
i'd
have
to
rely
on
your
reading
of
the
proviso
that
that
proviso
was
a
--
was
a
determination
by
the
congress
that
we
agree
to
this
context,
we
give
consent,
but
we
add
that
to
the
condition
that
you
must
waive
the
consent
which
otherwise
you
wouldn't,
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
entirely,
that
congress
has
conditioned
the
consent
that
is
implied
constitutionally
to
give
but
the
legality
of
the
compact
by
appropriate
condition.
and
the
question
is
whether
it
didn't,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
we
should
--
we
should
make
an
independent
determination
to
what
the
law
of
missouri
intended
to
use?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
are
free
--
you're
a
free
speaker.
that's
one,
your
reading
of
the
proviso
is
a
compact.
two,
the
workman
(inaudible)
immunity.
and
three,
that
in
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there's
been
a
waiver,
is
that
right?
now,
as
to
this
latter,
may
ask
whether
one
reaches
that
whether
you're
asking
this
court
to
determine
what
tennessee
and
missouri
law
is
and
against
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
holding
--
or
controlling
on
this,
which
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
suppose
--
suppose
one
is
against
you
on
the
proviso,
suppose
one
is
against
you
on
workman
and
then
says,
“well,
why
is
there
a
waiver
(inaudible)
in
the
court
of
appeals
tells
us
that
the
local
law
has
given
that
a
restrictive,
as
you
read
a
narrow,
unjustified
interpretation
but
such
is
the
local
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
you
decide
that
that
isn't
the
local
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
and
the
law
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
is
the
local
law,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
said
but
as
it
is
the
statute
limitations
run
against
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
workman
case
had
no
justification
for
holding
that
somebody
could
sue
the
state
of
new
york
for
a
maritime
tort
committed
by
or
told
by
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
action
of
a
specific
authorization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
be
sued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
technical
type,
they
owned
vessels
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
was
(inaudible)
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
--
if
such
a
vessel
commits
and
changes
to
a
private
--
if
there
is
such
a
private
person,
sue
apart
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
could
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
power
to
sue
here,
there
is
no
question
that
(inaudible)
