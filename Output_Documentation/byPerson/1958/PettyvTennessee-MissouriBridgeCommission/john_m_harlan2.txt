justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
a
question?
i
understood
you
to
say
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
agreed
with
him
that
if
the
workman
doctrine
applied,
it
would
apply
to
this
jones
act
situation,
a
jones
act
case
even
though
it
isn't
technically
brought
into
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
admiralty
in
every
side.
supposing
we
came
to
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
construing
the
missouri
law
and
the
tennessee
law
had
not
been
aware
of
the
workman
doctrine,
what
should
we
do
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
it
would.
