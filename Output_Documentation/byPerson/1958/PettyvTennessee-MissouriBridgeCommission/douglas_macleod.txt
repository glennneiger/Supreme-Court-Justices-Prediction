mr.
douglas
macleod
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
death
of
a
crew
member
of
a
ferryboat
which
happened
back
in
july
of
1956,
on
the
occasion
of
a
collision
between
his
ferry
and
an
up
bound
barge
pusher
or
a
towboat,
that
was
pushing
some
barges,
the
ferry
crossing
from
missouri
to
tennessee
and
the
towboat
coming
upstream
in
the
mississippi
river.
the
collision
happened
in
the
channel
of
navigation.
the
suit
originated
as
a
jones
act
suit
by
the
administratrix
of
the
deckhand
of
the
ferry
who
was
drowned
and
the
defendant
in
the
original
action,
the
tennessee-missouri
bridge
commission
came
in
on
a
motion
in
the
district
court
asserting
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states
of
tennessee
and
missouri
and
this
motion
was
sustained.
we
were
thrown
out
of
court.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court.
now,
we
know
who
the
plaintiff
is,
the
petitioner.
the
difficulty
in
this
case
arises
with
the
respondent,
the
defendant
in
the
jones
act
action
below.
what
sort
of
a
creature?
what
sort
of
standing
in
court
in
federal
court
particularly,
does
the
federal
--
do
the
federal
courts
have
any
jurisdiction
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
first,
is
it
the
sovereignty?
is
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
of
missouri
and
tennessee
involved?
are
we
dealing
with
the
sovereign
states
of
tennessee
and
missouri?
that's
one
question
which,
as
of
a
purely
substantive
character,
goes
to
the
very
essence
of
the
right
to
sue
at
all
in
this
type
of
situation
by
anybody.
the
second
question,
even
if
there
is
a
right
to
sue,
does
the
eleventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
preclude
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states?
tennessee-missouri
bridge
commission
is
a
body,
a
corporate,
and
politic
to
use
the
language
of
its
charter
or
compact
set
up
by
joint
action,
simultaneous
action
of
the
legislators
of
tennessee
and
missouri
with
the
consent
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
without
which
consent
such
compact
would
be
null
and
void
under
the
constitution.
the
congress
gave
conditional
consent
at
the
time
that
it
gave
us
consent
and
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
petitioner,
the
conditions
under
which
congress
gave
its
consent.
the
language
of
congress,
in
approving
the
compact,
provided
“that
nothing
contained
herein
shall
be
construed
to
affect,
impair
or
diminish
any
right,
power
or
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
court,
department,
board,
bureau,
officer,
or
official
of
the
united
states,
over
or
in
regard
to
any
navigable
waters,
or
any
commerce
between
the
states
or
with
foreign
countries,
or
any
other
matter,
any
other
person,
matter
or
thing
forming
the
subject
matter
of
the
aforesaid
compact
or
agreement
or
otherwise
affected
by
the
terms
thereof.”
now,
that's
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
it's
listed
in
the
body
of
the
brief
as
pages
8,
3
and
4.
the
printer,
however,
continued
in
directing
numerical
sequence.
so,
it
begins
on
page
19
and
that
will
be
page
21
of
the
brief.
that's
the
public
law
411
of
the
81st
congress,
the
consent
statute
approving
this
compact,
just
by
a
state
compact,
and
it's
our
position
that
the
compact
itself
and
all
language
contained
therein
must
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
and
there
is
language
in
the
compact
conferring
upon
the
respondent
commission,
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued.
that's
in
language
that
has
become
familiar
in
granting
powers
to
public
corporate
bodies,
the
languages,
the
power
to
contract,
to
sue
and
be
sued.
what
does
it
mean?
does
it
mean
what
it
says
or
does
it
mean
that
the
words
to
sue
and
be
sued
are
limited
by
the
word
preceding
to
contract?
mr.
douglas
macleod
if
the
government
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
if
the
court
please,
first,
we
--
assuming
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
sovereign
states
themselves,
then
we
must
find
either
consent
or
the
equivalent
thereof
in
terms
of
waiver.
mr.
douglas
macleod
yes.
mr.
douglas
macleod
that
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
well,
the
question
of
governmental
function
is
one
which
is
an
open
question
in
this
case.
for
purposes
of
argument,
it
has
been
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
compact
as
to
whether
this
was,
in
fact,
a
governmental
function,
purely
a
question
of
law
in
this
state.
mr.
douglas
macleod
and
governmental
function.
i
am
not,
in
my
brief,
drawing
this
distinction
because
i
don't
think
the
solution
of
the
problem
depends
upon
that.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
public
corporate
body
and
if
the
decision
of
this
court,
workman
against
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york,
1900,
decided
by
this
court
in
1900,
is
valid
law,
then
being
a
public
corporate
body
as
distinguished
from
the
states
themselves,
there's
no
problem.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
in
a
governmental
or
proprietary
capacity.
mr.
douglas
macleod
that's
because
the
maritime
law
as
interpreted
in
that
case
in
the
supreme
court,
doesn't
recognize
local
rules
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
it
was
indeed.
mr.
douglas
macleod
it
was
maritime
tort.
mr.
douglas
macleod
and
we
have
a
maritime
tort
here
also,
then
we
have
an
analogous
situation
except
that
we
don't
have
a
fire-boat.
we
have
a
common
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
--
the
common
carrier
charging
ferries.
mr.
douglas
macleod
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that's
not
my
case.
that's
one
way
of
disposing
of
the
case
and
if
the
court
sees
fit
to
follow
workman
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
precisely.
and
if
the
court
sees
fit
to
follow
workman,
then
there's
very
little
--
very
little
else
to
do
and
no
worries
and
no
headaches.
however,
even
if
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
well,
no
indeed,
sir.
mr.
douglas
macleod
no,
sir,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i
think
that
this
is
a
sound
decision
for
a
reasons
which
are
not
fully
developed
in
the
opinion,
but
which
are
developed
later
on
in
the
brief
in
connection
with
the
additional
reasons
why
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
there
are
--
i
have
a
worthy
opponent
here
and
i
have
asked
if
he's
going
to
have
another
side
to
argue
in
this
case,
justice
brennan.
i
--
i
feel
that
--
that
maybe
i
have
another
string
to
my
bow
and
i
do.
i
have
two
more.
one
is
that
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
this
is
an
--
it's
a
jones
act
action
at
the
law,
but
the
substantive
rights
are
maritime.
this
is
a
maritime
law
we're
dealing
with.
we're
dealing
with
the
jones
act
which
is
an
inevitable
part
of
the
maritime
law.
mr.
douglas
macleod
it
did,
but
in
so
doing
i
believe,
mr
justice,
that
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
this
constituted
an
amendment
to
the
body
of
the
maritime
law
and
it
has
been
so
regarded
as
an
integral
part.
mr.
douglas
macleod
well,
the
maritime
law,
if
the
court
please,
i
believe,
is
whatever
this
court
and
congress
have
adopted
and
what
congress
has
amended
from
the
whole
body
of
the
maritime
law,
going
back
to
what
it
was
at
the
times
of
the
colonies.
mr.
douglas
macleod
the
provisions
of
the
consent
statute
of
congress,
it
seems
to
me,
require
a
finding
of
waiver
of
governmental
immunity
even
if
this
be
regarded
as
a
suit
in
essence
against
the
states
of
tennessee
and
missouri
themselves.
i'm
willing,
if
i
have
to,
to
defend
on
that
ground.
mr.
douglas
macleod
the
relevance
of
that
is,
that
here,
states
are
setting
up
an
agency,
an
instrumentality
to
carry
on
activities
in
two
areas
which
are
exclusively
federal
in
nature
and
control,
which
the
federal
government
has
priority
to
control,
first,
interstate
commerce.
that's
a
common
carrier
charging
ferries.
this
ferry
is
a
common
carrier.
mr.
douglas
macleod
in
the
reference
to
the
particular
compact,
what
meaning
could
the
words
have
other
than
mere
surplusage
except
as
a
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
two
states
to
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
compact
as
they
saw
fit
according
to
their
own
local
rules.
mr.
douglas
macleod
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
the
--
every
seaman
has
a
right
under
the
jones
act
to
sue
his
employer
for
negligence.
except
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
except
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
douglas
macleod
i'm
suggesting
that
two
states
who
are
doing
something
which
--
without
the
consent
of
congress,
they'd
be
otherwise,
unable
to
do.
and
that
is
to
enter
a
bi-state
compact
to
run
a
ferry
over
navigable
waters
controlled
by
the
federal
government,
and
interstate
commerce
also
controlled
by
the
federal
government,
that
congress
says,
“all
right,
fine,
but
if
you
do
that,
you
have
to
play
it
according
to
our
rules."
mr.
douglas
macleod
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
douglas
macleod
it's
preserved
the
status
quo
as
to
the
right
of
the
united
states
government,
not
only
as
to
its
authority
over
these
matters,
but
also,
as
to
any
other
person,
matter
or
thing
forming
the
subject
matter
or
a
thing
forming
the
subject
matter
of
the
aforesaid
compact
or
agreement
or
otherwise
affected
by
the
terms
thereof.
in
other
words,
any
vessel
on
navigable
waters,
any
ferry,
any
individuals
working
on
navigable
waters
or
in
interstate
commerce,
that's
my
view
of
the
meaning
of
--
to
be
ascribed
in
this
language
and
to
--
to
take
this
meaning
away
would
render
it
absolutely
meaningless.
it
will
have
no
meaning,
whatsoever,
it
seems
to
me,
unless
that
meaning
be
ascribed.
mr.
douglas
macleod
they
went
along
with
the
state
courts
in
missouri
and
tennessee
both
of
which
give
a
narrow
construction,
both
of
which
follow
a
narrow
construction.
it
says
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
no
reference
made
in
your
decision
in
the
keifer
case.
the
only
authority
--
the
only
authority
that
is
quoted
was
the
district
court
with
the
missouri
case
and
i
believe
the
missouri
and
tennessee
cases
were
quoted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
douglas
macleod
i
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
in
--
in
the
main,
those
were
respondeat
superior
cases.
mr.
douglas
macleod
yes.
now,
that
is
the
third
string.
mr.
douglas
macleod
yes.
mr.
douglas
macleod
it
means
that
suit
is
permitted
in
contract
but
not
in
tort
where
the
language
to
contract
to
sue
and
be
sued
is
used
in
such
--
in
such
bodies
in
both
tennessee
and
missouri.
mr.
douglas
macleod
if
in
respect
to
their
local
affairs,
purely
and
simply.
mr.
douglas
macleod
yes.
mr.
douglas
macleod
without
more,
this
court
cannot
say
so.
however,
the
--
an
interstate
compact
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
this
congress
--
congress
can
decide
to
the
--
which
compacts
it
will
approve
between
states
and
the
conditions.
mr.
douglas
macleod
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
follow
your
last
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
douglas
macleod
that
is
part
of
it,
yes,
sir,
correct.
that
the
congress
has
said
that,
here,
in
order
to
get
approval
of
this
context,
you
must
subordinate
yourself
to
the
power
of
the
federal
government
over
into
interstate
commerce
and
also
over
navigable
waters
and
that
is
maritime.
mr.
douglas
macleod
correct.
the
third
point,
regardless
of
a
congressional
compact
--
act
of
consent
of
congress
with
the
compact
by
engaging
in
activities
in
an
area
where
congress
under
the
powers
granted
the
federal
government,
has
legislated
and
set
up
standards,
the
states
have
subordinated
themselves
and
yet
by
the
mere
fact
of
engaging
in
those
activity.
mr.
douglas
macleod
they're
subject
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
as
respects
all
regulation
set
up
by
congress,
all
rules,
all
laws
enacted
by
congress
and
all
regulations
of
proper
administrative
bodies
in
the
federal
government
or
interstate
commerce
and
over
navigable
waters.
in
so
doing,
by
the
mere
act
of
doing
it,
and
as
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
the
united
states
against
california,
which
is
directly
in
point
on
this
question,
and
that
a
terminal
railroad
was
operated
by
the
state
of
california.
as
in
this
case,
they
charged
rates,
freight
rates
for
moving
cars,
but
ultimately
it
was
nonprofit.
it
was
all
filed
back
into
harbour
improvement.
the
united
states
undertook
to
collect
a
penalty
--
penalty
provisions
of
the
safety
appliance
act
and
california
pleaded
sovereign
immunity
and
also
pleaded
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
said
that
since
it
was
stated,
entitled
to
be
tried
even
if
there
was
no
sovereign
immunity
only
by
the
supreme
court.
and
this
--
this
court
rejected
both
pleas
and
said,
“that
in
this
situation,
the
state
of
california
by
the
mere
act
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
has
subordinated
itself
to
the
safety
--
the
--
the
safety
appliance
act.”
now,
the
safely
appliance
act
is
a
companion
legislation
to
the
fela.
the
fela
is
the
jones
act
for
maritime
workers.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
very
strikingly
lanalogous
situation
and
a
subsequent
state
court
of
--
from
california
the
--
the
appellate
court
of
the
state
of
california
following
the
united
states
against
california
held
that
an
fela
suit
by
an
employee
of
the
railroad
against
the
state
of
california
directly
is
perfectly
good.
now,
so
here
we
have
not
only
the
question
of
the
workman
problem,
the
corporate
--
public
corporate
body
as
distinguished
from
the
state
and
even
there
that
you
could
easily
find
and
then
there's
plenty
of
authority
that
this
is
not
necessarily
governmental.
this
is
maybe
is
proprietary.
there
are
cases
both
ways.
that's
one
thing.
second
point,
we
have
this
--
the
consent
statute
of
congress
which
imposes
the
conditions
and
subsequent
to
which
the
states
did
set
this
commission
up
and
accept
money
from
the
federal
government
as
well
as
contribute
themselves.
and
thirdly,
they
did
in
fact
go
into
this
area,
this
area
of
interstate
commerce
and
operation
of
vessel
on
navigable
waters.
they
subjected
themselves
to
the
authority
of
the
united
states
government
and
they've
subordinated
themselves
and
they
have
waived
their
sovereign
immunity
and
they
have
waived
any
privilege
they
have
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
which
of
course,
as
this
court
is
quite
familiar,
no
(inaudible)
of
authority
is
needed
that
the
privilege
of
the
eleventh
amendment
may
be
waived
and
they
have
certainly
done
so
here.
mr.
douglas
macleod
well,
the
language
to
contract
to
sue
and
be
sued
without
more.
mr.
douglas
macleod
the
--
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
in
a
number
of
instances
cited
in
respondent's
brief
where
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
so
held,
that
where
this
language
was
employed
by
the
state
legislature
in
setting
up
a
body
whether
the
whether
it
be
a
road
district
or
whatever
it
might
be
and
the
language
to
contract,
“to
sue
and
be
sued”
was
employed
that
that
meant
that
suit
could
be
in
contract
but
not
in
tort.
but
just
to
pose
the
problem
in
another
way,
suppose
that
this
ferryboat,
ferry
commission
had
been
completely
in
the
clear
on
this
collision
and
suppose
it
had
undertaken
to
sue
this
big
towboat
company
that
was
--
big
towboat
that
was
coming
up
the
river.
do
you
think
that
then
that
the
commission
would
take
the
position
that
this
language
referred
only
to
contract
and
not
the
tort
if
they
were
the
plaintiffs
in
a
tort
suit?
what
about
a
collision
between
that
ferry
and
another
vessel?
they'd
be
the
first
to
come
in,
of
course.
well,
if
they
can't
be
the
defendant
in
a
tort
suit,
they
can't
be
the
plaintiff
in
a
tort
suit,
either.
and
then
how
can
they
serve
the
public,
have
passengers,
people
in
automobiles,
hire
people
to
work
for
them
and
say,
"we're
immune.
you
can't
sue
us."
mr.
douglas
macleod
no,
sir.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
should
determine
this
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
as
this
court
has
in
very
early
case
held,
that
the
construction
of
a
compact
of
this
nature
is
not
a
matter
in
which
the
rules
of
decision
of
the
courts
of
the
participating
states
even
should
be
considered.
mr.
douglas
macleod
attributes.
mr.
douglas
macleod
i
think
that
you
are
to
determine
for
your
own,
on
your
own,
in
--
in
terms
of
international
law
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
i'm
not
going
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
i'm
not
trying
--
i'm
not
asking
this
court
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
--
to
change
--
to
change
the
determination
of
the
local
law
of
missouri
or
tennessee.
mr.
douglas
macleod
it
did.
mr.
douglas
macleod
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it's
not
important.
mr.
douglas
macleod
i
think
i
have
one
minute
only
--
mr.
douglas
macleod
the
new
york
case
which
i
think
is
the
principal
weapon
in
my
opponent's
arsenal
differs
in
several
respects
from
the
instant
case.
first,
it
is
the
state
of
new
york
by
definition.
so,
that's
separate
and
distinct
from
our
case.
second,
it
did
not
involve
an
interstate
compact
which
we
have
here,
which
changes
the
whole
complexion.
we
can
never
get
away
from
this
interstate
compact
anywhere
in
this
case,
no
matter
what
theory
you
go
on.
it's
not
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
new
york
case.
and
thirdly,
in
my
view,
the
new
york
case
was
wrongly
decided
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
arguments
advanced
in
the
california
case
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce
were
not
advanced
in
the
state
of
new
york
case,
with
respect
to
navigable
waters
and
matters
of
maritime
and
the
power
of
the
united
states
government
to
control
in
this
area
--
in
this
area
of
navigable
waters.
this
was
not
advanced
apparently
at
any
level
in
--
in
the
case
of
in
re
state
of
new
york.
