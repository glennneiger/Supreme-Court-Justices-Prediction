justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
suggest
you
can
be
overruled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
you
stated
and
answered
the
question
that
local
law
that
they
construed
--
that
they
construed
in
making
that
a
consent
to
sue
and
be
sued
must
be
construed
as
not
applying
to
tort
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
scope
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
the
question
because
i
do
not
see
whether
the
court
of
appeals
held
it.
it
did
hold
that
that
was
the
law
of
missouri.
it
does
not
hold
it
in
such
(inaudible)
tennessee
that's
quite
a
different
rule
in
tennessee.
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
difference
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
i
was
curious
to
know
because
it
did
hold
(inaudible)
missouri
that
they
didn't
have
in
tennessee.
they
made
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
based
--
was
it
based
on
that?
i
didn't
think
so
and
i
thought
we
had
laid
on
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
know
it
was
held
on
--
based
on
the
fact
that
that
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
commerce
clause
gives
the
congress
power
to
grant
legislation
and
it
regulates
the
interstate
commerce.
it
had
regulated
railroad
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
that
the
railroads
were
owned
by
the
state
would
not
be
liable
under
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
--
the
federal
government
couldn't
make
it
liable
if
it
went
into
railroad
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
rather
thought
that
the
california
case
was
based
on
the
idea
that
congress
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
held
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
thought
we
had
another
case
and
you
looked
it
up
which
happened
to
be
in
the
brief
case
we
have.
