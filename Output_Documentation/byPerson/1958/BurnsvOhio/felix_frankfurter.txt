justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
get
permission
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
the
supreme
court
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
is
there
--
will
an
appeal
lie
at
any
time
after
the
court
of
appeals
make
an
adjunct
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
says
that,
he
says
that,
the
clerk
says
that
what
you
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
there,
clear
me
up,
was
there
after
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
appellate
division
turned
it
down
(inaudible),
did
he
then
file
a
notice
to
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
anything
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
he
abandoned,
formally
or
how
do
you
express
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
is
now
worse
off
than
having
file
something
(inaudible)
than
if
he
hadn't
done
anything
and
began
to
file
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
view
of
your
actual
statute
of
limitation
anybody
has
been
convicted,
no
matter
how
far
back,
the
conviction
was
reviewed
in
your
courts
of
appeals
and
your
appellate
courts,
it
can
now
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
an
estimate
of
yours
or
have
any
statistical
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
the
question
is
how
many
convictions
affirmed
in
appellate,
your
intermediate
appellate
court
for
which
review
was
sought,
no
reason
given
and
no
reason
was
sought,
proceedings
cannot
be
brought
saying
he
didn't
--
we
couldn't
because
he
didn't
have
$20.
but
you
just
say
that's
your
guess
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
illinois
but
â€“
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what's
that
phrase
that
you
use
in
ohio
in
denying
these
leaves
of
appeals,
a
regular
phrase
about
no
constitutional
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
record
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
said
pleas
to
appeal
will
only
be
granted
if
there
is
a
constitutional
question,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
asking,
i
want
to
know
whether
on
what
grounds,
if
may
i
ask
this,
on
what
grounds
can
you
ask
the
supreme
court
to
review
the
affirmance
of
a
conviction
in
the
appellate
court,
on
which
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
so
that
insofar
as
anybody
knows,
if
he
had
his
$20,
he
said
he
could
have
been
heard
in
the
supreme
court
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
anybody
knows?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
leave
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
in
--
is
there
any
decision
of
the
supreme
court
or
this
merely
a
what
shall
i
say,
careful
clerk
or
clerk
(inaudible)
$20
is
there
any
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
if
in
fact
an
application
is
made
for
the
supreme
court
to
take
the
case,
with
an
affidavit
that
he
is
a
pauper,
he
is
indigent,
is
there
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
that
they
(inaudible)
but
they
can't
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
forbid
it,
does
the
statute
forbid
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
it
say
anything
about
--
is
the
statute
--
the
statute
hasn't
been
construed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
rule
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
that
rule
exclude
application
to
the
court
to
be
relieved
from
the
operation
of
the
rule
because
of
poverty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that,
we
have
such
a
rule
too
you're
your
application
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
a
good
reason,
why
didn't
you
say
there
is
no
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
before
us,
the
clerk
isn't
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says
on
writ
of
certiorari
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
implies
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
did
something,
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
which
is
the
record
of
the
court,
there
is
no
record
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
from
the
clerk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
can
go
to
the
supreme
court
and
ask
mandamus
or
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
--
have
you
(inaudible)
--
has
your
supreme
court
(inaudible)
jurisdiction
of
mandamus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
yet
got
a
letter
from
the
clerk
saying
i
would
accept
your
petition
for
mandamus,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
constant,
i
mean
(inaudible),
not
so
long
ago
was
a
case
that
this
court,
but
not
this
court,
but
a
case
where
the
question
was
what
the
power
of
the
supreme
court
(inaudible)
was
and
it
was
argued
them
that
statute
is
clear
and
every
thing
else
and
chief
judge
mcgruder
wrote
for
that
court
that
i
believe
that
when
i
told
so,
but
not
before.
how
do
we
know
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
may
do
(inaudible),
does
anybody
know?
are
you
prepared
to
tell
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
washington
prepared
to
tell
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
inaudible)
he
was
able
to
file
the
document
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
i
know
(inaudible)
and
other
courts
are,
but
perhaps
you
can
do
the
same
even
in
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
he
didn't,
he
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
instead
have
a
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
foreclose
people
saying
there
is
no
judgment
because
you
didn't
raise
it.
is
there
a
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wallace
gets
many
number
of
letters
addressed
to
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
treat
it
as
though
they
were
form
of
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
clerks
are
not
(inaudible)
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
binding
--
i
want
to
ask
--
that
is
binding
on
us.
we
have
held
again
and
again
what
the
state
court
thinks
of
a
judgment
is
not
in
our
view
necessarily
of
a
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
discrimination
have
you
in
mind
in
which
you
can
classify
the
granting
and
the
not
granting,
has
the
element
of
time
within
which
you
must
file
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
a
distinction
is
there
between
--
is
there
discrimination
in
any
sense
of
that
meaning,
that
one
fellow
you
must
give
notice
as
against
the
fellow
who
didn't
have
to
give
notice,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
discrimination
in
any
invidious
or
hurtful
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
have
that
because
you
didn't
have
the
griffin
case
until
recently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
griffin
case
didn't
make
a
distinction.
for
my
point
of
view
it's
least
fiction
to
say
that
was
the
law
all
long,
it
wasn't,
it
was
made
so
in
griffin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
automatically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
he
doesn't
get
anything
for
extra
--
you
haven't
got
occupational
labors
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
very
different
question,
that
question
comes
up
all
the
time
in
the
federal
court,
and
even
in
this
court.
we
have
applications
here
asking
for
relief
(inaudible)
and
it
has
(inaudible)
but
that
isn't
the
problem
in
this
case
is
it?
your
problem
is
what
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested,
that
the
instances
in
which
make
men
really
want
to
appeal
to
your
supreme
court
for
another
review,
haven't
got
the
necessary
$20,
it's
so
insignificant,
so
unreal
a
limitation
upon
the
power
of
getting
hearing
from
that
court,
that
the
legislature
or
the
judiciary
has
the
right
to
make
that
decision.
that's
what
this
case
turns
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
now
read
the
two
wanamaker
cases
and
it
doesn't
help
me
in
the
slightest
with
my
problem
(inaudible).
the
first
wanamaker
case
says
that
a
lower
court
can't
mandamus
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court,
and
tell
that
clerk
what
did
you
do
with
reference
to
matters
before
that
court,
(inaudible).
and
the
second
wanamaker
case
simply
would
be
the
general
rule
that
involved
this
problem
at
all,
that
the
clerk
has
always
the
duty
of
seeing
that
the
formal
requirements
are
satisfying
and
he
can't
pass
on
the
merits
of
a
mandamus,
any
connection
with
that
and
we
should
think
that
it's
properly
prepared
or
accompanied
by
regular
filing
fee,
that
doesn't
deal
with
my
problem
at
all
whether
action
could
be
added
to
the
court,
so
that
the
court
when
it
held
to
waive
its
requirement
of
fee,
will
respond,
and
not
the
clerk
in
giving
the
general
rule,
he
is
just
(inaudible)
in
that
regard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
appellant
in
those
two
cases,
with
all
due
respect
to
mrs.
washington,
you
shed
no
light
on
my
problem
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
you
know,
how
do
i
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
simply
says
this
is
the
regular
thing,
that
you
require
a
filing
fee,
but
the
specific
problem
whether
a
specific
appeal,
it
then
raises
the
general
question
whereby
a
court
could
say,
is
it
a
new
problem
for
us
hereafter
to
indigently
establish,
he
weighs
this,
was
not
before
the
wanamaker
court
and
is
not
to
be
inferred
from
the
clerk's
letter,
it
is
just
telling
a
routine
order
of
(inaudible)
