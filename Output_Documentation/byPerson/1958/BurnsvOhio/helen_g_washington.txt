ms.
helen
g.
washington
may
it
please
the
court,
my
argument
will
be
very
brief.
as
in
griffin
against
illinois
and
eskridge
against
washington
state
prison
board
recently
decided
by
this
court,
this
case
concerns
an
indigent
convicted
defendant
who
was
deprived
of
the
appeal
rights
given
him
by
state
law,
solely
because
he
was
too
poor
to
pay
one
of
the
costs
of
appeal,
here
the
docket
fee
demanded
in
advance
for
docketing
his
appeal
papers.
as
in
the
griffin
and
eskridge
case
the
only
question
is
whether
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibited
the
state
from
denying
appeal
rights
given
to
others,
to
one
who
does
not
have
the
money
to
pay
the
cost.
the
details
giving
rise
to
this
question
maybe
quickly
stated.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
by
a
jury
of
a
felony
in
a
trial
court
in
ohio.
he
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
state
penitentiary.
upon
an
appeal
to
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
his
conviction
was
affirmed.
ohio
law
gave
him
further
appeal
rights
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
under
the
law
there
is
an
appeal
as
of
right
if
a
constitutional
question
is
involved.
in
other
cases
one
whose
conviction
of
a
felony
has
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
may
move
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
for
leave
to
appeal
and
will
have
leave
granted
if
good
cause
for
the
appeal
is
shown.
the
state
statute
and
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
provide,
however,
for
the
payment
of
the
docket
fee
of
$20
before
the
appeal
papers
will
be
docketed.
this
petitioner
who
was
in
the
penitentiary
without
the
assistant
of
counsel
prepared
a
motion
for
leave
to
appeal,
a
motion
for
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
and
then
affidavit
of
poverty.
he
transmitted
these
papers
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
together
with
a
copy
of
the
notice
of
appeal
filed
in
the
court
of
appeal.
the
supreme
court,
acting
through
its
clerk,
immediately
returned
his
papers
to
him,
with
the
explanation
that
the
docket
fee
required
by
statute
and
the
court's
rule
had
not
have
been
paid
and
that
an
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
was
not
an
acceptable
substitute.
thus
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
construed
the
statute
and
its
rules
as
denying
access
through
the
court
to
those
who
were
unable
to
pay
the
fee,
although
everyone
else
could
have
his
appeal
docketed.
under
the
griffin
and
eskridge
decision
such
a
discriminatory
interpretation
of
the
statute
cannot
stand.
since
ohio
has
a
general
policy
of
allowing
appeals,
or
appeal
rights
in
the
supreme
court,
it
under
those
decisions
cannot
consistently
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
deny
them
to
one
who
does
not
have
the
money
to
pay
the
cost.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
elaborate
anymore
on
that
point.
we
rest
our
case
on
the
decisions
in
the
griffin
and
eskridge
cases.
on
brief
the
state
advances
only
one
reason
why
those
cases
should
not
apply
here.
the
state
says
that
the
petitioner
has
had
one
appeal
here,
his
conviction
was
affirmed
and
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
anything
more,
that
when
ohio
does
give
a
second
appeal
it
can
establish
any
conditions
for
it
that
it
sees
fit.
i
think
that
this
is
a
misreading
of
griffin.
the
teaching
of
that
case
certainly
is
that
if
a
state
does
grant
appeal,
it
should
grant
it
to
rich
and
poor
alike,
that
would
be
regardless
of
the
level
at
which
appeal
was,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
the
first,
second
or
tenth
appeal.
and
we
submit
that
this
case
could
return
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
with
appropriate
instructions
to
give
petitioner
his
rights.
ms.
helen
g.
washington
i
don't
know
whether
i
ought
to
get
into
this
view
of
counsel's
concession
that
the
letter
of
the
clerk
should
be
treated
as
the
judgment
of
the
court.
but
the
wanamaker
case,
if
they
--
that
when
the
clerk
carries
out
the
instructions
of
the
court
he
is
acting
for
the
court,
and
in
this
case
the
clerk
was
carrying
out
the
instructions
of
the
court,
the
letter
say
so
--
ms.
helen
g.
washington
his
letter
says
so.
ms.
helen
g.
washington
well,
the
clerk's
letter
does
indicate
that
the
court
has
ruled
on
this
question
and
that
he
is
following
that
ruling,
at
least
that
is
my
interpretation
of
it,
and
i
think
for
practical
purposes
it
has
to
be
treated
as
the
order
or
the
judgment
of
the
court.
