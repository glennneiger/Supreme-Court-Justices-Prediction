mr.
william
m.
vance
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
please
the
court.
i
think
the
whole
question
before
this
court
here
is
whether
or
not
the
effect
of
griffin
should
be
extended
because
in
griffin
under
the
statues
of
the
state
of
illinois,
felony
cases
are
appealed
only
and
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
misdemeanor
cases
are
appealed
to
the
appellate
court.
before
our
case
can
be
appealed
or
considered
on
appeal
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois,
they
had
to
have
a
transcript.
griffin
had
no
transcript
and
he
said
he
had
no
money
to
buy
one,
therefore,
his
case
was
heard
in
lower
court
one
appeal.
in
ohio
it
is
different.
our
primary
appellate
court
is
the
court
of
appeals,
a
three-judge
court
of
which
we
have
ten
in
the
state.
in
this
case
burns
was
convicted
in
the
trial
court.
he
had
self
retained
counsel.
he
was
not
a
poor
man.
he
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
he
had
his
transcript.
he
got
a
full
appellate
review
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
his
case
was
affirmed.
now
at
that
stage,
he
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
he
did
the
necessary
administrative
step
two
of
notifying
the
prosecuting
attorney
before
he
filed
his
application
for
an
appeal.
at
that
time
as
i
say
he
apparently
was
not
indigent,
he
had
his
own
self
retained
counsel.
he
went
out
and
he
had
his
review.
he
dropped
and
abandoned,
at
that
time
that
contemplated
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
it
was
not
until
years
later
after
griffin,
the
griffin
decision
had
been
announced
and
after
he
had
spent
those
intervening
years
in
the
penitentiary
where
whatever
resources
that
he
might
have
had
when
he
first
went
in
were
undoubtedly
dissipated
and
he
was
in
truth
and
in
fact
a
pauper,
that
he
then
goes
and
without
taking
that
necessary
step
of
notifying
the
prosecuting
the
attorney,
he
files
his
notice
of
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
one
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
tries
to
do
it
on
a
pauperis
affidavit
and
they
send
back
and
say
it
takes
$20
to
get
here
in
this
court
on
that
kind
of
a
motion.
mr.
william
m.
vance
the
date
of
the
conviction,
if
it
please
the
court,
was
in
1953.
it
was
four
years
later
that
he
attempted
this
second
attempt
to
appeal,
the
first
one
having
been
abandoned.
mr.
william
m.
vance
he
would
not
because
he
had
not,
before
doing
that,
notified
the
prosecuting
attorney.
i
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
don't
know,
if
it
please
the
court,
whether
that
question
has
ever
been
raised,
because
i
think
that
just
routinely
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
notified,
before
they
file
the
motion.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes,
with
the
prosecution.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
vance
get
permission
of
the
prosecuting
attorney?
mr.
william
m.
vance
oh
yes,
what
he
attempted
to
do,
file
is
nothing
but
a
motion
for
leave
â€“
mr.
william
m.
vance
--
a
motion
for
leave,
and
there
is
no
matter
of
right
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
vance
right,
i
take
it
from
the
statute
if
your
honor
please
he
would,
because
that
reason
is
as
follows.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes
it
is
a
practice.
it
says
that
before
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
or
a
motion
for
leave,
for
leave
must
first
be
obtained
a
copy
thereof
must
be
served
upon
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
william
m.
vance
not
in
this
latest
attempt,
he
did
on
the
first
attempt
when
he
abandoned,
which
he
abandoned.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
correct.
he
filed
with
the
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
no.
mr.
william
m.
vance
never
got
beyond
the
clerk's
office.
mr.
william
m.
vance
not
in
the
1957
attempt,
no,
although
required
by
statute,
he
had
not
done
that
and
hasn't
done
so
yet.
but
back
in
1950
or
1951
when
he
filed
his
motion
for
leave
to
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
he
had
complied
with
the
statute
and
given
a
copy
of
it
to
the
prosecuting
attorney,
and
then
he
went
no
further
with
it,
he
just
dropped
it.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no
that's
the
peculiar
thing.
it's
merely
here
on
a
letter
from
the
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
william
m.
vance
by
$20,
that's
it.
mr.
william
m.
vance
well
i
think
that's
significance
in
this,
that
even
if
he
had
sent
his
$20
he
wouldn't
have
been
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
think
you
honor
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
think
he
probably
must
because
there
is
nothing
except
for
my
statement
in
the
record,
to
indicate
there
was
that
debate,
it's
in
my
brief.
mr.
william
m.
vance
he
had
no
lawyers,
at
his
time,
in
1957.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes
we
have
no
time
limitation
for
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
raised
that
question
in
my
own
mind
frankly,
whether
or
not
the
effect
of
that
first
notice
would
carry
over,
but
the
statute
says
that
when
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
is
--
a
motion
for
leave
to
appeal
is
filed,
a
copy
of
it
shall
served
first
upon
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
that
this
was
not
a
proceeding
on
the
notice
filed
back
in
1950,
but
it
was
an
entirely
new
notice
and
an
entirely
new
proceeding.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
correct
and
i
can
say
in
all
candor
to
this
court
that,
that
was
not
why
the
clerk
returned
the
paper.
he
returned
the
paper
because
the
rule
of
the
court
says
that
he
will
accept
no
filing
except
when
the
$20
docketing
fee
is
paid,
now
that's
squarely
before
the
court.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes.
mr.
william
m.
vance
he
did
and
also
served
to
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yeah.
mr.
william
m.
vance
he
abandoned.
mr.
william
m.
vance
there
was
nothing
ever
--
never
filed,
there
was
no
transcript
brought
up
for
any
thing.
actually
he
brought
about
that
time
a
mandamus
action
to
compel
the
court
to
proceed
on
other
indictments
that
were
pending
against
him
and
in
the
litigation
of
that
he
was
defeated
by
the
appellate
court
of
hamilton
county,
and
then
he
simply
went
to
jail
and
proceeded
no
further
with
any
appeal.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
quite
true,
that's
quite
true.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes,
and
that
that
is
of
course
what
makes
it
such
tremendous
importance
in
the
state
of
ohio.
we
have
some
16,000
felons
in
our
penal
institutions
and
literally
thousands
of
them
would
come
within
that
category,
where
if
griffin
is
extended,
to
say
it
that
covers
not
only
the
furnishing
of
a
transcript,
but
the
payment
of
this
minimum
fee
of
$20,
we
are
faced
with
simply
thousands
and
thousands
of
belated
appeals,
based
upon
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
have
no
statistical
basis.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
just
my
guess,
yes,
i'm
rather
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
of
course
we
think
there
is
a
tremendous
difference
a
transcript
of
testimony
which
run
in
to
the
hundreds
of
dollars
and
a
$20
filing
fee.
now
griffin
draws
this
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
well
it's
a
lot
easy
to
get
$20,
than
it
is
to
get
$2,000
to
get
a
transcript,
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
william
m.
vance
there
is
no
constitution
question.
he
could
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
did.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no
he
--
unless
is
there
a
constitutional
question
involved,
then
he
can
only
appeal
by
leave
of
court,
in
a
felony
case.
mr.
william
m.
vance
there
were
none
involved
in
his
case.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no
debatable
constitutional
rights
involved.
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
don't
think
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no.
i
simply
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
wasn't
involved
in
that
case
at
that
time,
i
wasn't
even
in
the
country
at
that
time,
but
mr.
schoettmer
who
will
share
my
time
is
the
assistant
prosecuting
attorney
and
he
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
factual
background
of
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
vance
the
record
is
not
here
accept
that
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
oh
no,
no
appeal
is
a
matter
of
right,
if
there
is
a
constitutional
question
involved.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes
same
thing.
mr.
william
m.
vance
but
in
the
court
of
appeal
you
can
appeal
without
leave.
mr.
william
m.
vance
on
any
ground,
even
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
if
the
--
on
the
hearing
of
their
motion
for
leave,
they
are
convinced
that
there
was
some
injustice
done
here
in
the
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
it's
my
opinion
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
by
the
leave
of
the
court.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
vance
in
the
court
of
appeals,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no
they
do
accept,
it
lose
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
no
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
the
statute
says
that
the
clerk
shall
not
accept
a
filing
until
the
following
fee
is
paid.
mr.
william
m.
vance
construed
not
in
a
case,
but
by
the
rules
of
the
court.
the
court
has
adopted
a
rule,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes.
mr.
william
m.
vance
not
specifically.
it
simply
says
that
the
no
case
shall
be
docketed
unless
it
is
the
--
that
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes.
mr.
william
m.
vance
what
mr.
wallace,
the
clerk
means
there,
there
has
been
no
decided
cases
determining
it,
but
the
justices
of
the
court
under
whom
the
clerk
operates
has
told
him
on
many
occasions
not
to
take
anything
unless
he
gets
the
$20.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no,
he
says
the
court
has
determined,
but
it
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
enjoin
administrative
determinations.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that's
what
we
are
contending,
there
is
no
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
for
this
court
to
review.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yeah.
mr.
william
m.
vance
you
have
nothing
here
but
a
letter
from
a
clerk.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yeah
that's
quite
true.
mr.
william
m.
vance
if
the
face
of
the
record
shows
that
there
is
a
constitutional
record.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes,
he
alleges
it.
mr.
william
m.
vance
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
vance
right.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes,
the
supreme
court
has.
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
of
our
courts
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
no,
no,
and
there
has
been
no
effort
to
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
am
not.
mr.
william
m.
vance
if
he
has
a
case
pending,
i
handle
habeas
corpus
cases
and
i
have
had
many
prisoners
who
come
over
and
go
before
a
supreme
court
and
act
as
their
own
counsel,
they
are
always
brought
over
and
make
a
personal
appearance.
mr.
william
m.
vance
they
have
a
guard
with
them,
but
they
do
an
admirable
job
of
arguing
their
own
case
sometimes.
mr.
william
m.
vance
(inaudible)
mr.
william
m.
vance
wyoming
(inaudible)
mr.
william
m.
vance
we
do
not.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes
it
is,
i
didn't
raise
it.
the
court
raised
it
and
asked
me
that
i
(inaudible)
thought
about
it.
mr.
william
m.
vance
no
there
is
only
a
letter
from
clerk.
mr.
william
m.
vance
we
feel
here
that
the
due
process,
equal
protection
is
not
involved,
the
same
rule
applies
in
this
man
as
to
all
other
people
who
file
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
he
had
his
appeal,
he
had
his
transcript,
and
the
griffin
decision
is
rather
a
black
and
white
affair,
it
says
the
rich
here
and
the
poor
here,
actually
we
as
all
know
life
is
great
mass
of
grays,
with
all
degrees
of
fluence
in
it.
that
here
is
a
man
who
has
$100
saved
up,
a
hard
working
man
who
has
$100
to
pay
the
matriculation
fee
of
his
son,
who
wants
to
go
to
college
and
he
gets
into
some
trouble
and
he
wants
to
appeal
his
case
and
he
has
to
reach
down
and
take
this
$100
to
get
in.
but
here
is
the
other
fellow
on
the
other
hand
who
stole
a
$1,000
and
blew
it
up
in
one
wild
night
of
entertainment,
so
he
is
broke
and
he
gets
into
that
fix
and
the
taxpayers
have
to
let
him
in
for
free
and
furnish
him
with
a
lawyer
and
give
him
a
transcript
and
let
him
file
a
(inaudible),
where
the
man
with
a,
just
a
modicum
of
money
has
to
expend
that
until
he
too
is
a
pauper.
mr.
william
m.
vance
he
could
not
ender
the
existing
rules
of
the
court,
with
this
exception
and
we
--
i
was
afraid
that
question
might
be
asked.
mr.
william
m.
vance
and
i
thought
over
the
lunch
period
what
i
would
say
to
you
and
i
do
believe
that
this
is
it,
that
the
rule
making
power
is
the
court
itself
and
if
they
can
make
rules
they
can
modify
rules
and
i
think
in
a
hard
situation
where
they
were
caught
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
the
court
has
the
plenary
power
to
say
that
although
this
is
not
customary
with
this
court,
in
this
case
we
want
to
hear
in
this
case
and
you
can
come
in
without
paying
this
$20.
mr.
william
m.
vance
i
think
they
could,
i
think
it's
within
the
plenary
powers
of
the
court.
mr.
william
m.
vance
and
the
answer
is
that
he
couldn't,
unless
the
court
through
the
communications
between
the
clerk
and
the
court
became
aware
that
there
was
a
crucial
matter
that
they
wanted
to
hear.
mr.
william
m.
vance
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes.
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes.
mr.
william
m.
vance
well
--
mr.
william
m.
vance
yes
it's
a
series
of
letters,
but
what
i
thought
the
justice
meant
was
has
anyone
got
himself
into
a
position
where
the
court
has
overridden
its
own
rule.
mr.
william
m.
vance
as
i
suggest
it
might
have;
mr.
schoettmer
of
the
prosecuting
attorney's
office.
