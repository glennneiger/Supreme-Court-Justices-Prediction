william
w.
burns,
petitioner,
versus
state
of
ohio.
mrs.
washington.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
had
the
$20
and
had
paid
it
to
the
court,
would
he
have
been
properly
before
the
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
problem
construed
that
way
by
your
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
to
file
notice
before
they
appeal
to
your
court
of
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
another
one
to
--
before
he
appeals
to
the
supreme
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
to
file
both
times?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
that
is
your
procedure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i'm
--
my
point
is
does
he
have
to
--
suppose
he
had
the
money,
he
has
already
filed
one
with
notice
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
under
his
original
appeal,
now
when
he
seeks
to
go
to
the
supreme
court,
if
he
had
$20
and
paid
it,
would
he
have
to
file
another
notice
with
the
prosecuting
attorney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
practice
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
he
serve
it
on
the
prosecuting
attorney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
why
wouldn't
the
first
notice
be
sufficient?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
the
same
thing
was
said
about
griffin
when
it
was
here,
but
i
haven't
seen
that
happen
in
illinois
or
the
other
states
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
vance
the
clerk
in
his
letter
said
this
will
served
to
acknowledge
receipt
of
your
motion
for
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
motion
for
leave
to
appeal
and
notice
of
appeal,
we
must
advice
that
the
supreme
court
has
determined
on
numerous
occasions
that
the
docket
fee
required
by
section
1512
of
the
general
code
of
ohio
and
the
rules
of
practice
take
precedence
over
any
other
statute
which
may
allow
a
pauperis
affidavit
to
be
filed
in
lieu
of
a
docket
fee.
so
either
the
clerk
is
wrong
or
your
court
has
construed
it
to
mean
that
there
is
no
access
to
that
court
at
all
unless
the
$20
fee
is
paid.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
doesn't
say
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
supreme
court
has
determined
on
numerous
occasions
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
vance
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vance
i
understood
you
to
say
that
its
been
your
contention
all
along
that
this
was
not
--
he
was
not
appealing
from
the
judge
on
the
court,
but
this
was
only
a
letter
from
the
clerk,
do
you
raise
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
raise
at
any
place
along
the
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
little
late
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
vance
let
me
ask
you
this
please,
suppose
this
was
a
constitutional
case
and
nothing
else
in
it,
and
the
defendant
had
no
money,
made
his
affidavit
such
as
he
did
here,
could
he
file
it,
could
he
document
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
(inaudible)[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright
now
could
they
do
that
just
as
well
if
it
wasn't
a
constitutional
case,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
get
back
to
justice
black's
question,
how
could
a
man
avail
himself
of
that,
how
could
he
get
into
court
to
have
that
determined
by
the
supreme
court
if
their
clerk
wouldn't
file
because
he
didn't
have
$20,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
vance
you
have
answered
justice
harlan
that
as
far
as
you
knew
no
one
had
ever
tried
to
do
that,
what
was
the
clerk
referring
to
when
he
said
on
numerous
occasions
the
court
has
held
that
they
cannot
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
there
must
have
been
somebody
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schoettmer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
exactly
the
question
i
ask.
i
assumed
of
course
that
the
court
could
waive
its
own
rule
if
it
wanted
to
do
it,
but
my
question
was,
were
there
any
cases
where
the
defendant
was
the
one
who
wanted
to
have
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
and
where
the
supreme
court
gave
him
that
relief
even
though
he
could
not
pay
the
$20.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
well
that's
my
only
question.
i
can
see
the
other
very,
very
plainly,
but
this
a
little
different,
you
must
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
it
denies
to
an
indigent
person
a
right
that
a
person
with
money
could
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
every
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
pay
him
for
work
in
ohio?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what,
how
much
per
day?
how
many
days
would
he
have
to
work
to
earn
$20?
chief
justice
earl
warren
three
months?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
supposedly
if
he
had
money
the
warden
would
know
it,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
make
no
question,
you
raise
no
question
as
to
whether
he
is
a
pauper
or
not
in
your
papers,
as
i
read
them,
as
a
fact
i
thought
mr.
vance
conceded
it,
said
he
is
wholly
without
funds
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
didn't
know,
i
didn't
know
that
you
had
raised
that
in
your
briefs
or
below.
as
i
understood,
the
state
does
not
assert
the
petitioner's
allegation
of
poverty
is
in
bad
faith.
if
you've
briefed
that
question
in
your
brief
please
call
my
attention
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
on
the
contrary
haven't
you
conceded
that
it's
not
done
that
in
bad
faith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
why
you
raise
it
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
concede
at
one
time
and
then
rely
on
it
later?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
not
interested
in
the
type
of
case,
we're
interested
in
this
particular
case
right
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
that
such
a
small
amount
that
it
doesn't
--
that
it
shouldn't
preclude
any
indigent
from
paying
it,
why
would
it
be
such
a
burden
on
the
state
to
waive
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
isn't
hardly
in
the
case
as
i
see
it.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
people
here
and
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
not
about
a
person,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
record
on
that,
but
what
is
the
answer
to
that
question?
now
i
can
see
where
it's
quiet
a
burden
on
the
state
or
at
least
on
some
state,
where
you
have
a
trial
that
involves
2,000
or
3,000
or
4,000
pages
of
testimony
that
require
them,
require
the
state
to
pay
for
that
transcript,
that's
quite
an
amount
of
money,
but
if
as
you
say,
any
indigent
in
prison
or
in
america,
could
if
he
wanted
to
pay
$20
for
access
to
your
supreme
court,
why
it
would
be
such
a
burden
on
the
state
to
waive
that
fee
when
in
order
to
give
indigents
exactly
the
same
standing
before
the
courts
to
people
with
money.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
why
it
is
such
an
important
issue
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
no
one
would
disagree
with
you,
if
you
said
that
everybody
could
have
but
one
appeal
in
the
ohio
and
that,
that
stopped
right
there
at
the
court
of
appeals,
but
when
you
prescribe
another
procedure,
above
that
whereby
people
who
have
means
can
have
access
to
the
supreme
court,
but
through
which
indigents
can
have
no
access,
then
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
an
entirely
different
problem.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
think
it
is
just
a
per
se
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
washington.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
washington
before
you
sit
down
i
would
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
assuming
this
responsibility
of
defending
this
indigent
prisoner.
we
are
always
comforted
by
the
fact
that
members
of
our
bar
are
willing
to
do
that
as
a
public
service
and
we
feel
very
much
indebted
to
you.
and
gentlemen
may
i
say
that
we
appreciate
the
prudent
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
state
of
ohio
and
also
for
your
very
extreme
frankness
that
you
have
displayed
in
this
case
and
that
of
course
without
regard
to
decision
in
this
case,
very
well.
