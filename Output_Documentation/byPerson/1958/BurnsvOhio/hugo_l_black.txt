justice
hugo
l.
black
now
may
i
ask
you
this
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
but
let
me
ask
you
this,
in
his
motion
for
leave
to
appeal,
you
say
that
if
you
raise
a
constitutional
question
in
this
appeal,
he
had
a
right
to
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
his
motion
has
not
been
denied,
has
there?
i
mean
the
facts
(inaudible)
have
not
been
denied
and
he
alleges
that
in
his
motion
for
leave
to
appeal,
the
judgment
against
him
was
rendered
upon
error,
prejudicial
conflicting
with
his
constitutional
guarantees
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
he
alleges
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
ground
on
which
he
sought
the
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
there
is
a
genuine
constitutional
question
as
well,
he
can
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
and
not
merely
by
leave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
prepared
to
tell
us
whether
this
prisoner
can
go
up
and
see
the
supreme
court
personally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
man
leaves
the
jail
and
goes
to
see
the
supreme
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
$20
is
so
small,
that
to
be
ignored
what
about
50
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
would
you
go
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
any
circumstances
(inaudible),
you
maintain
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
$20
just
be
ignored?
justice
hugo
l.
black
through
(inaudible)
in
the
united
states.
