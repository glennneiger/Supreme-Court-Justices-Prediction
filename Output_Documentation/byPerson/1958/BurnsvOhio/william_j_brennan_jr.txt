j.
brennan,
jr.
never
got
beyond
the
clerk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
vance
this
case
is
not
before
us
(inaudible)
in
ohio
that
indicates
that
his
failure
to
serve
this
notice
had
anything
whatever
to
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
far
as
we
know,
all
that
we
have
is
that
it
was
not
accepted
in
the
supreme
court
because
it
was
not
accompanied
by
payment
of
$20.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
significance
can
we
attach
to
if
it's
the
fact,
i
assume
it
must
be,
that
he
didn't
serve
the
required
statutory
notice
on
the
prosecutor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
significance
can
we
attach
to
it?
there
is
nothing
before
us
in
this
case
that
anything
whatever
to
do
with
his
failure
to
be
heard
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
the
fact,
the
fact
you
are
telling
us
that
ohio
concedes
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
this
court
may
treat
the
letter
as
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
tried
together?

was
this
robbery
or
what?
