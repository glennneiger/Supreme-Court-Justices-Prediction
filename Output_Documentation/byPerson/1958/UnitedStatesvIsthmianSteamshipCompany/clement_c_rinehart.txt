mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
for
the
united
states
has
obscured
the
only
question
presented
by
the
record
produced
to
its
real
substance.
the
sole
question
presented
is
merely
this.
whether
as
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
suits
against
the
united
states
in
admiralty
shall,
as
section
3
of
the
act
expressly
requires,
proceed
and
to
be
heard
and
determined
according
to
the
principles
of
law
and
to
the
rules
of
practice
obtaining
in
like
cases
between
private
parties.
that's
the
express
language
of
the
statute.
the
district
court,
applying
a
rule
of
practice
regarding
setoffs
which
would
unquestionably
guard
in
a
suit
between
private
parties,
sustained
exceptions
to
the
answer
of
the
united
states
which
have
admitted
the
claim
in
the
libel
but
have
sought
contrary
to
the
rule
to
set
off
a
claim
of
the
united
states
against
the
respondent
which
was
wholly
unrelated
to
the
contract
upon
which
the
libel
was
based.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
there
are
31
decisions
all
uniform
on
the
point
in
the
various
circuits
where
maritime
cases
have
been
dealt
within.
they've
been
the
rules
since
about
1832
at
least
when
mr.
justice
story
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
perhaps
it
is.
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
it
is
the
rule
and
that
the
only
way
in
which
a
--
a
rule
of
practice
in
admiralty
may
properly
be
changed
is
to
follow
the
statutory
procedure
laid
down
in
title
--
in
section
2073,
which
i've
quoted
in
the
brief.
just
as
you
have
to
have
certain
procedures
to
change
the
rules
of
civil
practice
or
--
well,
they're
all
equity
and
law
oppose
together
in
the
civil
suits
now.
you
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
there
is
no
case
one
way
or
the
other
in
this
court,
your
honor,
but
the
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
there
are
31
decisions
which
i
cited
in
the
margin
of
pages
12
--
13
and
14
of
my
brief
and
many
of
them
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
many
of
them
quite
recent
ones.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
of
course,
as
your
honor
will
recall,
setoff
is
the
--
is
the
creature
of
statute.
it
--
it
wasn't
something
that
existed
all
the
time.
it's
been
cut
down
by
admiralty.
the
--
the
--
it's
the
other
way
around.
the
statute
have
set
off
--
enlarge
what
was
the
rule
in
common
law
proceedings.
and
it
wasn't
until
1910
when
the
equity
rules
were
changed
to
permit.
up
until
1910,
equity
was
like
admiralty
as
now.
and
there
was
a
statutory
rule
changed
by
rule
merging.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
admiralty
presents
very
particular
situations
which
do
not
exist
in
either
law
or
in
equity.
and
i
tried
to
set
out
in
--
on
pages
15
and
16
of
my
brief
some
of
the
considerations
which
make
it
a
special
situation
in
admiralty.
but
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
the
rule
does
exist
and
that
the
statutes
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
have
said
that
they
only
may
change
the
rule
by
the
rulemaking
procedures
that
are
specified
in
the
title
28,
section
2073.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
they
could
enunciate
a
new
admiralty
rule
so
i
suppose
if
you
disregard
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
that
they
have
to
be
proclaimed
in
a
certain
way
before
this
session
of
congress
begins
to
take
effect
90
days
after
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
being
announced
and
things
of
that
sort
that
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
sir.
that
is
expressly
the
--
the
section
that
deals
expressly
with
changes
in
the
admiralty
rules.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
right
or
wrong
the
rule
exist
and
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
requires
that
it'd
be
observed
and
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
it's
a
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
it's
not
only
a
general
rule
announced
in
these
uniform
decisions
throughout
the
admiralty
courts
of
the
country
from
their
very
inception
but
also,
it
is
recognized
in
the
general
rules
of
this
court
in
rule
44
of
the
general
admiralty
rules
and
in
the
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
if
your
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
it
--
by
that
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
your
honor,
perhaps,
i
don't
understand
but
do
you
mean
a
--
a
specific
statement
in
the
rules
as
promulgated
now
by
this
court?
there
is
no
such
actual
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
that's
quoted.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
that's
quoted
right
on
the
--
in
my
brief.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
no,
it's
in
the
government's
brief.
excuse
me.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
rule
16,
page
4,
your
honor.
it's
a
--
it's
a
different
(voice
overlap)
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
it's
been
repeated
in
decision
from
time
to
time.
they
are
saying
that
--
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
admiralty
to
consider
an
unrelated
setoff.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
you
mean
related
to
government
suits,
your
honor?
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
in
the
--
that's
rule
16.
you
--
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
distinction
between
a
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
general
rule
and
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
and
a
rule.
that's
a
rule.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor,
and
also
rule
44.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
to
appoint
but
i
think
mr.
spritzer
gave
a
wrong
impression
about
the
second
suit,
the
independent
suit
filed
by
the
government
on
the
--
the
identical
cause
of
action,
the
identical
words,
was
brought
before,
the
set
off
was
pleaded
in
this
case.
and
that
suit
still
is
going
on
to
--
to
the
issue
and
testimony
has
been
taken
but
the
government
doesn't
proceed
with
it
because
they're
waiting
to
hear
how
this
case
comes
out.
so
we
have
the
result
that
the
identical
words
appeal
on
two
pieces
of
paper,
one
of
them
is
called
an
answer
in
this
suit
and
the
other
is
called
a
libel
in
the
independent
suit
that's
still
pending
and
they
will
be
decided
before
the
same
judges
and
the
merits
of
the
case
will
be
determined.
and
that
also
satisfies
the
--
the
requirement
of
section
227
that
you
spoke
of,
mr.
justice
whittaker
because
that
only
requires
a
new
suit
to
be
brought
by
the
government
in
case
a
judgment
is
recovered
against
the
government
on
the
--
respondents
claim
here.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
if
the
debt
is
not
already
in
suit.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
our
--
our
client
gains
exactly
the
thing
that
i
think
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
government
doesn't
want
this
to
happen.
if
the
government
--
if
we
obtain
the
decree
or
hold
the
decree
which
we
now
have,
then
the
government
is
required
to
either
accept
our
claim
or
to
assert
its
--
or
prosecute
its
suit,
its
independent
suit
to
a
conclusion.
and
if
it
fails
to
do
so,
then
we
are
entitled
successfully,
then
the
statute
expressly
provides
section
227
of
title
31
that
as
compensation
for
the
delay,
our
client
is
entitled
to
interest.
congress
has
so
provided
and
that's
the
remedy
that
they
were
entitled
to
have
of
what
--
they
get
to
this
set
off
voice,
why
of
course,
that's
a
different
sort
of
situation.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
sir.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
we
wouldn't
get
any
cash,
your
honor,
until
their
suit
had
been
concluded
because
they
have
a
suit
pending
and
the
general
accounting
office
would
be
entitled
to
withhold
payment
of
our
judgment
until
that
other
suit
was
concluded.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
as
i
understood
the
suit
--
i
mean
the
question
that
was
asked
by,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
what
difference
it
makes
to
us
now
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
to
our
client
now.
and
i
--
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
that
was
my
answer.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
think
that
that
is
probably
so
except
that
within
the
violation
of
the
admiralty
rule
and
that
is
--
that's
in
this
particular
case
was
because
i
think
that
the
cross
claim
that
the
government
has
set
up
is
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
but
the
moment
you
--
you
depart
from
the
rule,
you
get
into
all
the
troubles
that
you
have
in
admiralty
where
you
have
limited
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
you
have
actions
in
rem
and
you
--
and
all
sorts
of
complications
that
would
arise
and
that's
one
reason
why
i
think
that
it
would
be
wrong
for
the
court,
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
one
particular
litigation
to
make
a
change
in
the
general
rule
which
has
existed
for
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
and
presumably
with
good
reason.
and
it
--
it
should
be
done
by
independent
rule
making
if
it
is
to
be
done
when
all
the
pros
and
cons
can
properly
be
considered,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
record
of
particular
facts
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
it
--
227
of
course
doesn't
--
that
if
the
matter
is
all
--
not
already
in
suit,
the
government
shall
bring
suit,
that's
what
section
227
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
that's
what
i
understand
that
section
to
be.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
don't
understand
that
that
entitles
the
--
the
section
227
entitles
the
united
states
to
prosecute
the
suit
that's
called
for,
in
a
way,
was
in
violation
of
the
rules
of
practice
of
the
particular
court.
and
this
would
be
in
violation
of
the
rules
of
admiralty
to
permit
the
set
off
of
an
unrelated
counterclaim,
was
in
the
same
suit.
i
don't
understand
that
section
227
is
intended
to
overrule
the
practice
that
exist
and
which
another
statute,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
requires
to
be
observed
in
the
case.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well
your
honor,
i
--
i
really
don't
see
any
difference
between
a
prosecuting
--
a
--
a
claim
which
the
government's
claim
is
labeled
as
set
off
in
the
one
hand
and
taking
the
same
claim
and
labeling
it
a
libel
in
the
same
trials
and
the
same
considerations
have
to
be
brought
before
the
court
and
the
court
has
to
make
its
decision.
and
then
there's
no
--
and
so,
there's
nothing
impracticable
in
--
in
letting
the
government
go
ahead,
doesn't
--
has
done
with
an
independent
suit.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
that
will
be
done.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
sir.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
and
that's
--
that's
what
the
district
judge
held,
there
was
a
motion
to
consolidate
by
the
government.
and
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
because
it
--
it
offends
--
it
makes
--
you
can
only
file
a
cross-libel,
that's
what
it
would
technically
be.
this
independency
will
be
a
cross-libel.
if
it
arises
out
of
the
same
transaction
as
the
original
libel,
now
the
--
that's
what
the
--
the
rule
of
this
court
says
too,
rule
44
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
your
honor,
of
course
that
--
that
isn't
the
hypothesis
on
which
the
government's
argument
proceeds.
they
say
they
admit
our
claim
so
there
wasn't
any
issue
to
be
fought
out
and
brought
up
to
this
court
on
whether
we
had
a
--
our
client
had
a
good
claim
or
not.
the
whole
thing
is
the
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
that's
--
that's
what
i
failed
to
understand,
your
honor.
the
same
cause
of
action
asserted
by
the
government
in
the
same
words
is
going
to
be
tried,
whether
we
try
it
and
call
it
a
setoff
or
whether
you
try
it
and
call
it
a
libel.
and
that
--
and
the
merits
of
the
government's
claim
are
going
to
be
adjudicated.
now,
that
takes
only
one
trial,
one
judge's
time
and
he
--
he
--
perhaps
the
same
judge
had
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
it
may
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
of
course
there
may
be
a
different
judge
but
it's
in
the
same
court
at
any
rate.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
no,
the
same
clerks
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
same
--
same
room,
one
has
a
different
number
on
it
than
the
other,
that's
all.
but
result
--
result
would
be
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
entirely
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
you're
--
you're
assuming
there
isn't
any
existing
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
absolutely.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
fundamentally,
of
course
,
there's
nothing
in
this
particular
state
of
facts
that
i
can
see
that
would
make
it
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
oh,
no
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that
that
--
that
this
is
a
unique
case
at
all
but
i
do
say
there
are
plenty
of
them
in
admiralty
that
aren't
anything
like
this.
that
it
would
be
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
affected
by
a
change
in
the
rule.
and
that
it
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well
if
--
just
so
long
as
the
certainty
is
in
the
practice,
that's
what
is
the
main
consideration
because
of
course,
you
can't
keep
changing
the
--
the
rules
all
the
time
very
happily
for
the
members
of
the
bar
at
any
rate.
of
course,
one
judge
may
think,
well
the
reason
for
the
rule
doesn't
apply
in
this
case
and
we
won't
pay
any
attention
to
the
statute
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
we
would
be.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
think
that
your
honor
is
right
and
i
agree
with
you
fully
but
of
course,
you
always
run
the
risk
that
somebody
may
take
a
different
view
of
the
thing,
and
here
we
--
we
have
a
claim
that
is
undisputed.
we're
entitled
to
have
it
paid
and
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
only
one
way
or
another,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
what
do
you
mean,
get
cash
for
it?
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
no
your
honor,
we
cannot
until
the
other
case
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
has
been
concluded.
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
no.
no,
the
--
the
suit
is
already
pending.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
oh,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
no,
it
--
it
would
be
simply
because
they
--
they
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
they
held
back
money
that
was
owing
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
on
--
on
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
why
--
and
certainly
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
i
think
it
should
be
allowed,
your
honor.
if
the
government
doesn't
maintain
its
counterclaims
successfully
then
i
think
that
the
interest
should
be
allowed
on
our
undisputed
claim.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
or
we
get
it
automatically
under
the
statute
the
way
it
is
now.
it
isn't
led
to
the
discretion
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
of
any
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
it
isn't
anything
that
the
second
circuit
has
adopted,
your
honor.
this
is
the
--
the
rule
in
admiralty
has
existed
from
the
beginning.
it's
never
been
enlarged
by
statute
presumably
because
they've
got
a
special
situation
of
limited
jurisdiction,
peculiar
jurisdiction
in
rem
in
all
sorts
of
things
that
make
it
--
i
think
inadvisable
to
have
a
rule
permitting
unlimited
settlements.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
--
i
know
but
the
rule
applies,
your
honor
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
whether
the
reasons
for
a
rule
applies
or
not,
it's
another
point.
but
the
point
is
that
congress
has
passed
the
law
which
says
that
the
rules
that
govern
private
litigation
shall
govern
suits
against
the
government.
and
the
first
thing
the
government
does
in
this
suit
is
to
ask
for
a
special
rule,
an
exception
to
be
made
in
favor
of
the
government
when
congress
says
that
--
that
the
ground
rules
that
apply
to
the
other
litigants
also
apply
to
the
government.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
they're
not
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
they're
not
being
deprived
of
any
right
whatsoever
in
this
case.
there's
no
prejudice
whatever
that
the
government
suffer
--
suffers.
now
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
i
hope
we
--
[laughter]
but
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
which
is
the
same
as
the
--
this
court's
general
rule
to
rule
44.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
you
--
you
--
if
you
may
not
do
it
by
setoff,
you
may
not
do
it
by
cross-libel
either
in
admiralty.
you
have
to
--
to
the
difference
between
setoff
and
cross-libel
is
simply
this.
that
you
can't
recover
affirmatively
on
a
setoff
which
is
pleading
on
the
answer.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
but
you
may
recover
affirmatively
on
a
cross-libel.
but
in
both
cases,
the
cross-libel
and
the
setoff
must
relate
to
the
transaction
or
cause
of
action
that
is
alleged
in
the
libel.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes,
sir.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
apart
from
the
--
the
interest
question
which
i
have
already
spoken
of,
i
don't
--
the
--
and
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
we
would
lose
but
under
section
227,
we
have
a
clear
right
to
the
interest.
now,
if
the
case
is
reversed
and
it
goes
back
for
trial
on
the
setoff,
then
of
course
it's
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
or
not,
assuming
the
government
is
unsuccessful,
he
allows
interest
on
our
claim.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
it
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
it
would
be
either
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
government
recovered
interest
from
us
under
their
claim.
of
course,
if
it's
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
if
these
independent
suits
was
tried.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
the
same
decision
in
both
cases,
i
don't
see
any
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
any
in
this
particular
suit.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
suits,
your
honor,
of
course,
you're
putting
a
question
to
me
that
i
--
i'm
not
entirely
sure
about.
that
just
now
i
don't
see
how
that
would
--
there'll
be
any
defense
that
we'd
be
deprived
of,
we
couldn't
assert
against
the
government's
setoff.
but
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
as
to
what
the
statute
requires
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
your
honor.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
no.
then
--
then
there's
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
mention
before
my
time
is
up
and
that
is
if
the
rule
is
changed,
where
you
come
to
suits
by
the
government
against
private
parties
so
as
to
permit
the
government
to
interpose
the
setoffs.
they're
going
to
be
left
with
a
very
incongruous
situation
because
by
statute,
under
the
public
vessels
act,
when
the
government
is
the
actor
and
sues
the
private
party
in
admiralty,
you
may
not
by
statutory
rule,
section
3
of
the
public
vessels
act
assert
against
the
government
any
setoff
unless
that
--
these
are
words
arising
out
of
the
subject
matter
for
cause
of
action
contained
in
the
government's
libel.
in
other
words,
the
private
party,
when
he
sues
the
government,
has
to
observe
the
admiralty
rule
and
will
have
to
no
matter
what
the
court
does
about
any
rule
in
this
case
because
no
decisional
rule
could
change
that
statute
and
the
government
would
have
the
admiralty
rule
applicable
in
cases
where
it
was
the
litigant
or
of
in
the
libel.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
yes.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
--
that
--
that's
certainly
--
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
--
their
--
indifferent
views
if
there
was.
mr.
clement
c.
rinehart
well,
i
--
i
won't
say
that
--
that
all
the
decisions
are
--
are
entirely
harmonious
but
i
don't
think
there's
very
much
spread
or
conflict
between
them
on
that
particular
point,
your
honor.
now,
of
course
i
have
the
--
i
have
a
number
of
other
points
but
now
i'll
have
to
rely
on
my
brief
for
those.
but
i
do
think
that
the
--
no
prejudice
whatever
can
result
to
the
government
and
i
do
think
that
if
the
rule
is
to
be
changed,
it
ought
to
be
changed
in
the
rule
making
procedure
that's
proscribed
by
the
statute
so
that
all
the
pros
and
cons
can
be
brought
out.
