justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
clear
up
one
thing
for
me?
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
the
government
contends
or
rather
does
not
contend
that
the
legality
or
correctness
of
its
claim
has
the
validity
of
the
claim
or
the
amount
of
the
claim
could
all
had
been
settled
in
this
libel
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
most
specifically
that
whether
or
not
--
was
it
audit
a
general
--
properly
withheld
could
have
been
contested
by
the
respondent
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
it
more
concretely
to
my
simple
mind.
the
controversy
here
is
whether
this
claim
by
isthmian
as
against
the
claim
by
the
government
unrelated,
if
you
please,
unrelated
claim,
all
been
settled
in
this
single
litigation
or
whether
the
government
owing
this
thing
should
have
paid
and
then
brought
a
separate
suit
for
its
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
controversy
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
it
is
about,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
claim
is
that
something
inherent
in
admiralty
precludes
this
thing
from
being
settled
in
a
single
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
--
that's
a
claim,
that's
an
argument
that
was
--
was
appealed
to
(inaudible)
let
us
say
(inaudible)
i
mean
what
difference?
that's
--
that's
a
legal
technical
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
court
is
in
satisfaction
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
whether
you
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
even
the
disturbing
factor,
jury
trial
or
not
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
need
to
have
those
consequences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
need
to
have
those
consequences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
mere
fact
that
you
allow
this
to
be
settled
in
one
suit
doesn't
disallow
you
to
say,
of
course,
it
must
be
a
billing
claim
and
not
one
which
is
told
as
to
which
the
statute
has
filed
the
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
quite
or
does
it
reach
my
suggestion,
my
feeling
that
the
mere
fact
if
you're
allowed
to
settle
it
all
in
one
litigation
for
the
right
to
challenge
judicially,
the
rightness
of,
whatever
you
call
it,
counterclaim
setoff
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ought
not
to
enlarge
the
substantive
rights
of
the
government
on
what
they
would
be
if
the
government
had
to
sue
independently?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
statute
of
limitation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
justice
harlan's
suggestion
prevails
for
the
instance
that
the
possibility
of
what
he
suggested.you
would
enlarge
it
if
a
suit
by
the
government
would
have
a
good
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
that
defense
ought
not
to
be
(inaudible)
because
you
set
it
off
in
a
--
in
a
libel
suit
by
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
libelant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
construing
that
statute
--
that
statute
not
to
give
power
to
the
accounting
office
to
get
something
by
way
of
setoff
which
they
couldn't
get
by
way
of
independent
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
--
that's
the
construction
of
the
statute
i'm
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
you're
usually
very
unequivocally
clear
but
i
do
not
yet
know
whether
you're
contending,
though
this
isn't
in
this
case,
that
by
virtue
of
this
statute,
a
stale
claim,
i.e.
one
that
could
not
be
sued
upon,
could
be
used
to
wipe
out
a
claim
against
the
government.
that
you
read
the
statute
so
as
to
dispense,
so
as
to
told
the
statute
of
limitations
that
otherwise
would
be
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
meant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
not
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
merely
the
statute
of
limitation
if
you
forgive
me.
it's
not
merely
statute
of
limitation
but
other
defenses.
i
don't
have
to
read
this
statute
as
a
personal
advice.
i
see
no
reason
for
reading
it
so
as
to
lift
all
defenses
that
would
be
available
against
the
government
if
separate
suits
were
brought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
case
it's
a
--
in
case
it's
a
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
fraud
overreaching
would
be
a
good
defense
assumed
--
assumed
for
the
moment
that
that
limitation
has
gone
the
other
way.
that
would
be
a
good
defense
if
brought
separately.
now,
i
don't
see
no
reason
why
one
should
construe
the
statute
so
as
to
erase
all
such
defenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
barred
by
decisions
of
this
court
to
hold
that
this
kind
of
a
case
between
private
parties
was
not
allowed
the
defense
that
was
--
to
be
adjudicated
in
this
libel
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
be
the
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
controlling
case
to
which
you
would
refer
holding
that
non-related
--
that
the
defense
not
arising
out
in
the
same
transaction
can't
be
dispose
of
in
a
single
libel
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
am
a
little
troubled
as
i
used
to
think
that
admiralty
was
very
advance
in
its
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
procedural
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
haven't
we
have
--
haven't
we
saw
change
that
rule
outlaws
that
one
might
say
a
progressive
body
of
law
like
admiralty
would
have
absorbed
it
by
now
without
formal
absorption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
obey.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court

monday
enunciated
new
admiralty
rules.
justice

(voice

that
is
put
by
admiralty
rules
too,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
of
their
rule
that
expressly
--
is
there
a
specific
rule
governing
this
situation?
you
read
the
general
rule.
and
that
general
rule
like
(voice

--
justice

--
statutes
that
have
grow
with
time
or
sought
new
conditions.
justice
felix

the
general
rule,
not
that
it
should
be
in
accordance
with
but
is
there
an
admiralty
rule
that
specifically
deals
with
the
problem
of
this
kind
of
a
defense
not
allowed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
specific
rule?
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right
on
the
general
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
if
there's
a
specific
rule
dealing
with
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
--
is
there
a
specific
rule
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
dealing
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
very
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
that's
what
i
call
a
general
rule,
mr.
rinehart.
is
there
a
rule
which
says
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
rule
which
says
that
no
setoff
can
be
allowed
except
arising
out
at
the
same
transaction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
that.
and
that
may
be
binding
on
me.
but
i
regard
it
as
a
general
rule
and
not
a
rule
that
specifically
deals
with
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
any
suit.
is
there
a
rule
that
deals
with
setoff
and
counterclaims?
is
there
a
statute

is
there
a
rule
promulgated
by
the

--
justice

where
is
it?
justice
felix

(voice

--
justice
felix

all
right.
justice
felix

well,
you
--
you
point
me
to
rule

all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rinehart,
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ask
you
this.
buttoning
on
to
what
you've
just
said.
you
brought
this
libel
against
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
government
filed
an
independent
libel
for
its
charter
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
two
libels
--
is
there
anything
in
the
rule
or
in
admiralty
practice
that
bars
the
court
from
consolidating
those
two
proceedings
in
a
single
hearing
before
a
single
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
why
--
what
route
--
what
rule
is
that
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
there
is
a
difference,
deal
--
take
--
take
this
court.
a
suit
is
filed
here,
a
petition
for
certiorari
filed,
is
granted
and
we
set
the
case
down
for
argument,
be
granted.
two
weeks
later
or
a
month
later,
there's
another
petition,
fully
independent
party,
totally
different
party.
and
this
court
consolidates
those
two
cases
in
argument,
fused
within
one
case
in
argument,
dividing
time
appropriately,
dispose
of
it
in
one
opinion.
now,
why
--
just
tell
me
what
rule,
either
explicit
rule
or
what
practice
in
admiralty
and
the
reason
for
it
that
disabled
the
district
courts
from
granting
a
libel
that's
filed
by
--
is
--
by
--
is
--
by
isthmian
steamship
company
against
the
united
states
in
a
totally
separate
libel
filed
on
a
separate
day
by
uncle
sam
against
the
isthmian
company.
what
is
there
in
rules,
either
of
the
local,
of
the
--
the
southern
district
or
this
court
or
admiralty
practice
with
bars
consolidating
those
two
proceedings
and
having
them
heard
by
a
single
judge.
assuming
both
--
assuming
further
that
they're
both
plain
admiralty
cases,
not
raising
questions
of
jury
trial,
i
don't
see
why
i
have
to
--
i
like
to
disclose
my
mind
to
counsel.
i
see
no
reason
why
i
can't
devise
a
limited
rule
because
i
can't
devise
a
larger
rule.
but
why
i
can't
decide
one
type
of
case
because
some
other
type
of
case
would
be
different
and
raise
different
considerations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
there
is
this
--
this
wastefulness
of
--
of
--
i'll
come
back
to
what
you
say
you
might
lose
and
the
government
doesn't
want
to
give.
there
is
this
waste
of
--
of
judicial
--
i
don't
mean
time
but
judicial
energy
and
--
and
a
lot
of
waste
in
having
extra
security
of
action
to
which
justice
whittaker
referred
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
--
perhaps,
you
are
raising
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
objective
conditions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
have
all
these
separate
courts,
separate
judges,
separate
papers,
different
clerks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
i
can
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
well
understand
and
that's
why
a
person's
descriptive.
i
can
well
understand
if
the
claiming,
the
libeling
would
lose
anything.
i'm
just
now
--
i'm
putting
to
one
side
the
rule
of
the
court
and
your
rightful
appeal
that
it's
my
business
to
obey
the
law,
i
try
to.
and
i'm
assuming
that
there's
no
block
in
the
room,
i'm
assuming
this
is
the
reason
taken,
what
is
there
that
prevents
this
thing
from
being
cleaned
up
in
a
single
proceeding
provided
--
provided
that
you're
not
--
your
client
is
not
of
pocket
or
isn't
inconvenience
or
hasn't
his
claim
in
the
slightest
degree
impaired.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
yes.
yes.
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
this
isn't
a
--
this
isn't
a
white
crow,
this
isn't
the
case,
the
libel
which
never
will
arise
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
why
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
if
other
cases
present
embarrassment
to
the
prosecution
of
a
rightful
claim,
then
that's
a
good
reason
for
qualifying
it
and
say
that's
not
a
case
in
which
cross
claims,
using
the
word
“broadly”
should
be
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
but
you
suggested
a
little
while
ago
that
it
would
be
disadvantaged
as
to
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
you're
disadvantaged,
that
raises
that
--
that
sort
of
--
that
--
that's
a
very
relevant,
substantial
--
now
why
would
you
be
disadvantaged?
why
couldn't
the
judgment
be
entered
on
your
claim?
i
think
you
shouldn't
be
disadvantaged
merely
because
the
government
can
say,
“we've
done
it
at
defense.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask,
mr.
rinehart?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
reason
why
i'm
very
unsympathetic
to
the
ancient
distinction,
the
only
distinction
between
setoff
in
congress'
way
and
then
so
on.
and
also
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction,
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction.
as
you
well
know,
the
courts
have
done
all
sorts
of
things
under
that
phrase,
“arising
out
of.”
i
mean
to
say,
they've
arisen
out
of
something
that
didn't
arise
off,
merely
because
of
hostility
to
that
narrow
procedure.
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
yes,
while
you
call
it
different
view.
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
this.
admiralty
courts
in
applying
the
rule
for
which
you
contend,
have
they
been
--
have
they
been
--
what
shall
i
call
it,
latitude
(inaudible)
in
finding
whether
they
did
or
didn't
arise
out
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
done
pretty
well.
