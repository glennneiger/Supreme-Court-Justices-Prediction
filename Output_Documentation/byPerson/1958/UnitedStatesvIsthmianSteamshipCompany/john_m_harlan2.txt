of
course,
you
haven't
got
any
statute
of
limitation's
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
you're
right
in
a
case
where
the
statute
of
limitation
is
involved,
that
the
government
has
this
power
to
apply
so
as
to
enable
it
to
set
up
a
defense
of
payment,
it
could
do
that
even
though
the
statute
limitations
had
run
on
its
affirmative
claim
if
it
had
chosen
to
sue
separately?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that'd
be
a
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
it
does
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
may
be
a
procedural
quirk
in
this
instance
but
it
does
have
consequences
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
leave
behind
this,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
your
argument
is
that
one
of
the
virtue,
one
of
the
arguments
in
your
favor
is
that
it
does
permit
the
government
to
deal
as
a
practical
matter
with
the
enormous
amount
of
business
it
has
not
to
worry
about
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
payment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
it's
construed
as
payment
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
then
it's
necessary
--
if
it's
construed
as
payment,
then
i
suggest
it
necessary
carries
the
consequence
that
in
a
statute
of
limitations
case,
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
this
way.
the
statute
is
in
no
effect
as
against
the
government
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
would
get
--
in
other
words,
you
would
get
the
full
amount
of
your
judgment
in
cash
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
subject
to
the
government's
right
in
this
other
suit
or
under
a
new
proceeding
under
this
other
section
to
suit
to
recover
the
amount
on
the
other
claim.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you,
one
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
rule
--
assuming
that
one
were
to
agree
with
you
on
rule
16.
the
reason
that
judge
dimmick
as
i
see
it
refused
to
consolidate
was
because
of
the
local
admiralty
rule,
rule
13.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
--
that's
consolidation
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
assuming
that
you
couldn't
plead
--
the
government
couldn't
plead
this
--
the
subject
matter
of
its
independent
suit
by
way
of
set
off
to
your
suit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
maybe
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
the
district
court,
you
think
if
rule
13
is
to
be
observed,
would
have
had
no
right
to
exercise
the
discretion
to
consolidate,
a
general
discretion
to
consolidate
that
justice
frankfurter
is
suggesting.
