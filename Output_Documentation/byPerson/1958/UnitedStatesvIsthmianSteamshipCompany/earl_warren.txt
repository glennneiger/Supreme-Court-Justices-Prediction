we'll

mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rinehart,
as
i
understand
that
the
--
the
government
has
two
arguments.
one
is
that
it
is
entitled
under
the
--
under
the
rules
to
maintain
this
counterclaim
and
the
second
one
is
that
if
the
rule
is
different,
it
wants
us
to
reconsider
the
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
assume
that
--
assume
that
we
decide
the
case
on
that
second
issue,
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
some
of
the
members
of
the
court,
i'm
sure
i
would,
would
like
to
know
what
financial
injury
would
occur
to
your
client
if
we
decide
against
your
position
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
wouldn't
the
judge
in
the
same
--
be
entitled?
the
same
discretion
if
it
tried
it
in
the
two
lawsuits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
if
it
tried
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
--
well,
but
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
judge
decides
your
interest
in
one
lawsuit
instead
of
two
so
far
as
your
financial
interest
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
you
deprived
of
any
--
any
defenses
or
you
--
in
the
government's
case
that
--
that
you
couldn't
have
in
this
--
in
this
one
suit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
really
what
--
what
you're
arguing
for
is
just
a
strict
maintenance
of
that
--
an
adherence
to
that
rule
because
it
is
the
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
see.
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
you
are
not
--
because
it
will
result
in
any
--
any
financial
injury
to
you.
