the
thought
of
the
interest
is
to
overrule
a
motion
to
consolidate
(inaudible)
in
fact
strike
out
the
cross-libel.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
but
i
have
no
trouble
here
and
that
is
the
rule,
as
you
denounce
it,
i
had
a
(inaudible)
and
to
the
extent
they
(inaudible)
a
pro
tanto
discharge
of
that.
now,
would
it
be
fair
that
(inaudible)
announcement
of
the
judges
to
make
findings
but
only
the
(inaudible)
rent
is
not
liquidated.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
why
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection
then?
what
effect
does
it
give
to
the
local
rules
that
in
the
admiralty
courts
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
payment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rinehart,
may
i
see
if
i
understand
what
you
said
that
interest
only
is
involved.
isn't
what
the
government
sought
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
prosecute
this
independent
claim
at
the
same
trial?
and
would
you
not
be
entitled
to
interest
in
any
case
on
your
claim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask,
as
in
that
connection
for
any
statutes,
mr.
rinehart.
are
not
rules
16
and
17
of
the
district
court
in
new
york
rules
of
practice?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
isn't
section
227
a
substantive
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
i
wonder
then
if
that's
so,
whether
or
not
227
being
substantive
if
it
is,
wouldn't
take
precedence
over
those
rules
of
practice
and
in
this
particular
case,
allow
the
court
to
determine
both
of
those
claims
in
one
suit.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
it
says
a
little
more.
it
says
that,
“if
there's
are
judgment
against
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
has
a
claim
against
the
judgment
creditor,
the
controller
must
withhold
payment.
and
if
the
government's
claim
is
not
in
suit,
then
he
must
put
it
in
suit
and
continue
to
withhold
until
the
government
claim
is
liquidated
and
then
off
set.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
now
that
i
don't
quite
understand
if
that's
--
if
that's
a
rule
of
substantive
law,
then
why
wouldn't
that
supersede
these
local
rules
of
practice
which
the
district
court
was
authorized
to
promulgate
and
did
under
the
names
--
numbers
of
16
and
17.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
thinking
about
this
practicality.
and
here
you've
got
both
parties
in
the
court.
and
there
is
the
original
libel
in
the
cross-libel.
the
government
can't
pay
on
the
--
in
a
judgment
rendered
on
the
original
libel
until
the
cross-libel
has
been
liquidated,
under
rule
220
--
under
rule
--
statute
227.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
then
why
in
the
interest
of
direct
settlement
and
conservation
of
motion,
wouldn't
it
be
best
to
settle
those
matters
into
one
action
and
get
this
thing
closed
up?
