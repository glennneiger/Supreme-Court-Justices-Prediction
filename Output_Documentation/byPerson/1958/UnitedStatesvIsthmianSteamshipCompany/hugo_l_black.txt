justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
entitled
to
have
it
paid.
suppose
you
get
a
judgment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
get
a
judgment
now,
can
you
get
it
paid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
cannot
get
cash.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
not
get
cash
until
the
government
filed
a
new
suit
or
filed
some
closer
suits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
his
case
it's
already
pending.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
don't
have
to
be
tried
out
too
in
all
the
courts
into
that
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
the
government
would
have
to
continue
to
pay
you
interest
because
it
was
not
all
decided
in
one
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
government
lost
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
government's
lost
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
is
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
all
right.
if
the
government
losses
--
but
why
if
it
were
decided
that
this
rule
does
pay
the
substantive
rule
of
law.
wouldn't
it
also
be
true
that
your
interest
would
be
protected
if
you
tried
it
all
that
in
one
suit,
the
same
as
though
you
waited
until
a
second
suit
could
be
filed
and
maybe
go
through
another
court,
somebody
have
to
pay
some
extra
cost.
but
why
--
why
shouldn't
this
and
justice
frankfurter
asked
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
shouldn't
the
others
be
allowed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
it
be
any
how
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
anyhow
if
congress
has
given
the
right
to
the
government
to
have
its
claims
tried
in
this
way,
what
right
has
the
circuit
up
there
to
adopt
rules,
it
deprive
it
of
the
benefit
of
this
kind
of
a
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
you
raise
all
these
questions
but
none
of
them
apply
to
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
may
--
may
be
so,
that
may
be
so
that
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
congress
has
also
said
that
the
government
shall
have
certain
rights
in
connection
with
its
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
227.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
somebody's
got
to
suffer
some
prejudice
in
having
the
basis
of
extra
cost.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least
that
much.
