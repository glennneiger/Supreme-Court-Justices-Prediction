mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
is
an
admiralty
case
which
presents
two
issues.
the
first
of
these
which
i'll
state
quite
generally
for
the
moment
involves
the
question
whether
the
courts
below
improperly
delimited
or
restricted
the
controversy
which
was
tendered
for
trial.
the
second
question
which
is
quite
distinct
is
whether
the
district
court,
having
rendered
judgment
for
the
respondent,
the
isthmian
steamship
company,
made
an
award
of
the
interest,
compound
interest
which
exceeds
the
statutory
limit
imposed
by
these
suits
in
admiralty
act.
the
libel
in
this
case
was
filed
by
the
isthmian
steamship
company
against
united
states.
and
the
pleadings
disclosed
that
there
are
two
commercial
transactions
involved.
i
need
not
go
into
any
of
the
detail
of
those
transactions
merely
it
is,
however,
necessary
to
state
their
substance.
first,
in
1946,
the
united
states,
through
its
agency,
the
war
shipping
administration,
leased
or
chartered
eight
government-owned
vessels
to
isthmian.
the
amount
of
the
charter
hire
was
to
be
determined
on
a
sliding
scale.
it
was
made
dependent
upon
the
amount
of
net
voyage
profits
that
were
realized
from
the
operation
of
the
ships.
a
disagreement
led
ultimately
to
dispute,
and
the
united
states
claimed
isthmian
not
acquiescing.
the
isthmian
owed
some
$115,000
in
charter
hire
beyond
what
it
had
paid.
now,
the
second
transaction,
in
1953,
an
isthmian
vessel
known
as
the
steelworker,
which
is
not
one
of
the
vessels
involved
in
the
charter
parties,
carried
a
large
quantity
of
military
freight
for
the
government
and
in
due
course,
submitted
a
freight
bill.
that
bill
was
for
$116,000
using
round
figures.
at
this
point,
the
united
states
paid
isthmian
roughly
$1000
in
cash
and
advised
isthmian
that
it
was
applying
the
balance
of
the
amount
due
on
the
affreightment
in
satisfaction
of
the
government's
preexisting
claim
against
isthmian
for
additional
charter
hire.
isthmian
thereupon
went
to
court
initially
as
it
happens
to
the
wrong
court.
it
filed
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
alleging
all
of
the
facts,
which
i've
just
outlined.
it
asserted
in
the
court
of
claims
complaint
that
the
government's
claim
for
additional
charter
hire
was
groundless
and
that
the
government
was
withholding
money
which
was
due
to
isthmian.
now,
the
court
of
claims
dismissed
that
complaint
on
the
government's
motion.
the
government
argued,
we
think
correctly
in
its
motion,
that
whether
one
view
the
subject
of
the
litigation
as
being
isthmian's
claim
for
maritime
freight
or
a
claim
that
the
government
was
improperly
withholding
money
because
it
--
charter
hire
claim
was
groundless.
in
either
event,
it
was
a
maritime
transaction
and
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
and
the
court
of
claims
agreed
and
isthmian
thereupon
when
into
the
district
court,
filed
a
libel
there
but
followed
a
different
tactic
at
this
point.
wherein
its
libel,
it
makes
no
reference
whatever
to
the
government's
claim
for
additional
charter
hire.
isthmian's
libel
as
the
court
will
note
in
the
record
merely
pleads
that
it
had
performed
within
the
limitations
period
certain
freight
services
that
it
submitted
a
bill
for
$416,000
and
that
it
received
only
$1000.
now,
the
government's
answer
to
that
libel
unqualifiedly
admitted
the
correctness
of
isthmian's
freight
bill.
the
government
then
pleaded
that
it
had
applied
the
balance,
that
is
the
$115,000,
in
satisfaction
of
a
claim
which
the
united
states
asserted
against
isthmian,
and
the
answer
then
proceeded
to
set
forth
the
facts
upon
which
that
additional
claim
for
charter
hire
is
based.
in
addition
to
filing
this
--
in
addition
to
making
this
affirmative
defense,
the
government
also
filed
a
cross-libel
in
which
it
repeated
its
claim
for
additional
charter
hire.
now,
isthmian's
response
to
the
government's
position
in
the
pleading
was
two-fold.
first,
it
said
that
the
government's
defense
that
it
had
withheld
the
amount
due
on
the
freight
bill
and
applied
it
to
the
government's
preexisting
claim
could
not
be
regarded
as
a
plea
in
the
nature
of
payment
or
satisfaction,
could
not
be
regarded
as
an
affirmative
defense.
it
said
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
counterclaim.secondly,
it
argued
if
you
regard
it
as
a
counterclaim,
then
it
is
not
in
our
--
in
isthmian's
view,
cognizable
in
admiralty
because
isthmian
argues
admiralty
can
only
recognize
counterclaims
which
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
which
is
the
basis
of
the
libel.
both
courts
below
accepted
that
position
and
concluded
on
that
basis
that
a
judgment
pro
confesso
should
be
entered
for
isthmian
and
that
the
united
states
then
should
institute
a
second
suit
to
determine
if
it
is
entitled
to
get
back
with
the
right
hand
what
it
has
just
been
ordered
to
pay
over
was
left.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
district
court
did
that.
it
said
once
it
struck
out
the
affirmative
defense,
there
was
no
common
issue
and
that
it
was
then
independent
counterclaim
and
that
admiralty
could
not
hear
an
independent
counterclaim.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
he
first
ruled,
as
i
recall
it,
that
this
was
not
a
matter
of
affirmative
defense
and
he
struck
that
from
the
answer.
then
he
said
at
this
point
the
libel
and
the
cross-libel
no
longer
have
a
common
issue
and
therefore
cannot
be
heard
and
the
government
has
relegated
to
bringing
it
back
in
lawsuit.
i
should
add
one
further
word
about
the
proceedings
below.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
here
is
really
the
opinion
in
the
grace
line's
case
and
not
in
this
case.
we
reprinted
the
grace
line's
opinion
as
an
appendix
to
our
petition.
the
grace
line's
case
involved
the
same
issue
as
this
but
involved
additional
issues,
and
we
did
not
petition
in
the
grace
line
case
because
of
the
fact
that
there
were
these
additional
complicating
factors
in
that
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
involved
a
limitation
problem
in
addition.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they're
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
correct,
your
honor.
now,
it's
apparent,
i
think,
that
the
result
which
--
of
the
kind
which
has
been
reached
here
would
certainly
not
be
required
inequity
or
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
whether
one
views
the
government's
position
here
as
the
assertion
of
an
affirmative
defense
or
as
the
assertion
of
a
permissive
counterclaim.
and
the
question
which
this
case
presents
is
whether
the
result
is
required
in
admiralty.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
it
arose
from
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
same
transaction.
i
perhaps
been
using
the
term
“setoff”
and
“counterclaim”
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
more
loosely
as
synonymous.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying.
yes.
now,
our
first
line
of
argument
doesn't
involve
a
consideration
of
the
admiralty
rules
at
all
because
the
argument
is
this,
that
the
united
states
has
a
right
which
is
founded
on
statute
and
finds
support
in
decisions
of
the
court
over
many
decades,
its
substantive
right
to
withhold
and
apply
when
it
is
both
debtor
and
creditor.
at
that
so,
if
there
is
such
a
power
in
the
united
states,
then
the
courts
are,
of
course,
open
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
had
a
valid
claim,
open
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
had
a
proper
basis
for
making
this
administrative
setoff.
we
say
however
if
there
is
this
right
to
withhold
and
apply
when
the
united
states
is
both
debtor
and
creditor,
one
doesn't
reach
any
question
under
the
admiralty
rules
because
our
defense
then
is
that
we've
made
satisfaction
we
paid.
it
is
a
plea
in
the
nature
of
satisfaction.
and
we
say
in
that
situation,
the
--
the
controversy,
the
real
controversy
as
the
court
to
put
it
in
the
somewhat
similar
new
haven
case
last
term,
the
real
controversy
is
whether
the
claim
to
--
upon
which
the
government
is
resting
when
it
says
we're
applying
what
we
owe
you
in
satisfaction
of
what
you
owe
us,
whether
that
claim
of
the
government
is
a
valid
one.
now,
basically,
the
--
the
position
of
the
respondent
which
we
have
to
meet
its
basic
objection
to
this
line
of
argument,
i
think,
is
summed
up
by
what
is
said
at
page
23
of
the
respondent's
brief.
and
they
quote
williston
for
the
proposition
that
mutual
debts
do
not
extinguish
one
another
either
automatically
or
by
manifestation
of
election
of
one
party
either
agreement
of
the
parties
or
judicial
action
is
necessary.
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
lapse
of
time
may
borrow
recovery
on
one-forth
debt
and
leave
the
other
still
enforceable.now,
acknowledging
that
this
may
be
the
general
rule,
and
we
don't
think
it
would
add
exception,
we
don't
think
it
touches
the
question
whether
the
united
states
has
a
statutory
right
to
make
it
administrative
setoff
without
agreement
of
the
other
party
when
it
is
both
debtor
and
creditor.
now,
such
a
right
is
not
unknown,
we
think,
to
private
party
relationships.
a
primary
example
of
it
in
the
common
law
is
what
is
often
times
referred
to
as
the
banker's
right
of
setoff.
i
think
it's
settled
in
almost
every
jurisdiction
in
this
country
perhaps
in
all
that
if
a
bank
holds
my
note
and
i'm
delinquent
on
it
or
to
demand
note,
and
i
have
a
deposit
with
the
bank
that
the
bank
may
apply
that
deposit
in
satisfaction
of
my
obligation
on
the
note.
if
i
think
that
the
bank
has
made
a
mistake
and
that
i'm
not
obligated
on
my
note
and
i
sue
to
get
my
deposit
from
the
bank,
the
bank
has
a
good
defense
if
it
can
show
that
it
in
fact
had
a
valid
enforceable
claim
against
me
based
on
the
note.
now,
we
think
this
is
analogous
--
excuse
me.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
is,
your
honors,
quite
correct
in
suggesting
that
in
most
jurisdictions
at
least
the
banker's
setoff
is
limited
to
liquidated
debts.
and
i
am
imposing
that
by
way
of
an
analogy
to
--
to
illustrate
the
kind
of
power
which
we
are
claiming.obviously,
we
must
rest
upon
statutes
which
pertain
to
the
united
states
and
decisions
which
pertain
to
it.
now,
turning
then
from
the
--
this
private
banker
illustration
to
the
public
banker,
to
the
position
of
the
comptroller
general
of
the
united
states.
we
believe
there's
a
long
tradition
which
finds
its
counterpart
in
continental
law
countries
as
well
as
at
common
law
that
the
sovereign
may
settle
accounts
between
itself
and
those
with
whom
it
deals
in
the
situation
where
it
finds
itself
both
debtor
and
creditor.
and
that
goes
back
that
power
at
least
to
the
--
so
far
as
statutory
basis
is
concerned,
to
at
least
to
1817
when
congress
enacted
the
predecessor
of
31
u.s.c.
71
upon
which
we
here
rely.
and
that
statute
provides
broadly
that
all
claims
or
demands
by
or
against
the
united
states
government
shall
be
settled
and
adjusted
in
the
general
accounting
office.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
think
it
has
been
construed
time
and
again
as
giving
a
power
entirely
beyond
the
power
to
adjust
between
different
departments
of
the
government,
a
power
to
settle
where
the
government
is
both
creditor
and
debtor
and
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
private
party
involved.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.it
has
--
has
been
so
applied.
this,
i
would
like
to
make
perfectly
clear,
does
not
suggest
that
the
adverse
party
can't
secure
a
full
determination
by
the
court
as
to
whether
the
government's
claim
which
gives
it
--
its
asserted
basis
for
withholding
as
a
valid
claim.
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
the
government
has
a
quite
independent
power
in
section
227
to
withhold
payment
of
judgments.
and
i
think
that's
quite
apart
from
31
u.s.c.
71
and
the
cases
which
have
relied
on
31
u.s.c.
71.
at
least
since
the
mcknight
case
in
98
u.s.,
we
think
the
court
has
repeatedly
indicated
or
held
that
the
government
has
the
authority
and
as
the
court
has
indicated
the
duty
to
set
off
one
against
the
other
when
it
is
both
debtor
and
creditor.
more
recently
in
the
munsey
trust
case,
the
court
used
the
language
that
when
the
government
acts
under
this
code
section,
it
strikes
a
balance
between
the
debts
and
credits
of
the
government.
now,
what
happens
when
the
government
follows
this
practice
which
has
been
traditional
with
the
general
accounting
office?
well,
normally,
the
complaining
party
filed
a
complaint
if
he
doesn't
acquiesce
that
the
government
has
a
basis
for
withholding
in
which
he
alleges
that
the
government's
claim,
the
claim
upon
the
basis
of
which
it
made
the
deductions
is
invalid
and
that
issue
gets
determined.
that,
for
example,
was
the
situation
in
the
alcoa
steamship
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
a
case
which
was
before
the
second
circuit
and
later
came
here.
in
that
case,
the
government
paid
a
freight
bill
which
was
submitted
by
alcoa
and
later
on
decided
that
the
maritime
freight
had
not
in
fact
been
earned.
it
then
withheld
an
equivalent
amount
in
paying
a
subsequent
bill.
alcoa
sued
upon
the
subsequent
bill
reciting
the
facts
as
to
both
transactions.
and
judge
learned
hand
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
that
case
that
the
question
in
the
case,
i
think
one
may
interpolate
only,
the
only
question
in
the
case
was
whether
the
united
states
overpaid
when
it
paid
the
first
bill.
now,
we're,
of
course,
not
questioning
that
the
government
made
itself
liable
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
or
amenable
to
the
ordinary
admiralty
practice.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
doesn't
touch
the
question
whether
the
government
has
what
we
urge
to
be
this
long
settled
power
to
settle
and
adjust
debts
in
a
manner
i've
indicated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
our
contention.
yes.
that
it
all
should
have
been
settled
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
one
litigation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
but
we
say
that
there
were
--
the
--
the
government
acknowledged
when
it
withheld
that
it
owed
the
freight.
owed
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
money
on
the
freight
bill.
the
government
said,
“we're
holding
that
money
in
satisfaction
of
our
claim
for
additional
charter
hire.”
we
say
when
isthmian
does
not
acquiesce
in
our
view
that
we
can
properly
withhold
and
apply
that
the
real
complaint,
the
real
subject
matter
of
the
litigation
is
whether
we
have
a
basis
for
withholding
in
applying.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
what
the
controversy
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
what
this
is
about.
that's
all.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
i
have
been,
up
to
this
point,
contending
that
this
was
properly
a
matter
of
affirmative
defense
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
plea
of
satisfaction
or
payment.
if
it
was
that,
then
nobody
would
doubt
that
it
was
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
further
--
to
the
other
side
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
is
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
a
technical
matter
but
in
this
instance,
the
technical
argument,
as
it
were,
enables
the
court
to
deal
with
the
reality
and
not
with
the
mere
formality
that
it
enables
the
court
to
decide
the
one
issue,
the
only
issue
that's
really
in
dispute
between
the
parties.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
namely,
whether
we
have
a
good
claim
for
additional
charter
hire.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
in
this
case
probably
the
only
practical
difference
is
that
the
result
reached
below
requires
a
multiplicity
of
litigation
rather
than
a
single
one.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
and
that
brings
up
to
the
point
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
this
case.
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
suppose
that
that
would
depend
upon
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
the
statute
and
how
you
construe
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
as
to
whether
the
statute
applies
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
to
the
claims
or
to
lawsuits.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
does.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
does.
may
i
point
out
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon,
sir?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
let
me
point,
if
i
may,
to
--
to
this
practical
consequence,
your
honor.
if
we
suppose,
and
this
is
not
the
case
here,
that
the
government
is
subject
to
a
one-year
or
two-year
statute
of
limitation,
if
that
so
and
the
general
accounting
office
follows
its
usual
practice
and
withholds
payment
on
a
subsequent
bill
because
it
has
a
preexisting
claim,
if
we
do
that
and
our
action
of
withholding
is
not
available
to
us
as
a
defense
but
must
be
asserted
as
an
--
as
the
basis
of
an
independent
suit,
we
cannot
afford
to
rest
and
wait
to
be
sued.
we
cannot
wait
until
our
action
of
withholding
is
challenged
because
time
may
run
out.
in
other
words,
we
may
be
required
to
give
up
this
method
of
adjusting.
and
--
and
the
government
is
involved
in
multiple
transactions,
of
course,
with
all
of
these
major
shipping
companies.we
may
have
to
go
ahead
and
make
sure
that
we
bring
suit
on
every
claim
which
involves
a
point
of
difference
rather
than
wait
for
the
other
party
to
decide
to
what
extent
it's
going
to
challenge
the
government's
action
and
withholding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
our
initial
argument
is
that
the
--
we
are
not
seeking
to
enlarge
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
that
the
government
has
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
but
our
first
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
our
first
line
of
argument
is
that
we
are
not
seeking
to
enlarge
the
government's
powers
but
are
resting
on
what
we
believed
to
be
a
statutory
power
which
has
a
long
history.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
in
this
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
think
that
it
gets
back
to
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
in
most
instances
--
in
many
instances,
i
should
say,
the
government
does
not
have
to
worry
in
any
event
because
it's
not
subject
to
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
specific
statute
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
(voice
overlap)
such
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
the
grace
line's
case
did
involve
a
statute
of
limitations
question.
that
is,
i
suspect,
the
--
the
more
unusual
rather
than
the
customary.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
of
the
stale
claim
because
there's
no
statute
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
limitations
to
apply.
if
the
government
does
have
this
power
to
withhold
and
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
applicable,
then,
i
think,
one
would
have
to
construe
that
statute
in
order
to
decide
whether
the
statute
not
only
relates
to
the
filing
of
suit
but
also
relates
to
administrative
action
by
way
of
effectuating
an
administrative
setoff.
now,
i
--
i
don't
think
the
court
has
resolved
--
has
had
occasion
to
deal
with
that
second
possibility.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
know
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
know
of
no
possible
effect
which
this
--
which
deciding
this
case
in
one
lawsuit
could
have
upon
the
respondent's
rights
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
this
litigation.
now,
the
only
other
possible
question
is
the
operation
in
unrelated
--
in
other
situations
of
the
statute
of
limitation.
i
don't
see
how
it
would
affect
any
defenses
which
go
to
the
merits
at
all
or
burden
of
proof
for
that
matter.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
can't
see
how
the
opposing
party
would
be
any
more
limited
if
it
had
to
set
out
its
claim
in
--
its
full
claim
in
its
libel
other
than
--
than
that
it
is
at
present.
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
--
that
isthmian
in
the
court
of
claims
said
the
government
is
not
paying
us
because
it's
withholding
on
the
basis
of
a
groundless
claim.
when
it
got
to
the
district
court,
it
said
the
government
is
not
paying
us
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
then.
at
that
point,
the
government
said,
“well,
this
is
the
full
story.”
and
we
pleaded
the
additional
facts
in
our
answer,
and
we
failed
to
see
why
the
court
can't
make
as
full
disposition
by
reading
both
sides
pleading
as
it
can
in
the
situation
where
the
full
story
is
told
in
the
libel
by
the
moving
party.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
our
--
our
first
argument,
as
i've
attempted
to
indicate,
is
that
the
rules
do
not
apply
because
this
is
a
matter
of
defense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
satisfaction
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
the
nature
of
satisfaction
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
would
think
that
that
would
depend
upon
a
construction
of
the
particular
statute,
your
honor.
i
--
i
agree
that
it
might
have
consequences
from
the
standpoint
of
limitations
problem.
now,
our
--
our
argument
on
the
rules
is
that
admiralty's
reluctance
to
hear
independent
counterclaims
and
the
reasons
which
prompt
that
have
no
application
to
a
situation
where
there
are
only
two
parties,
no
third
party
rights,
where
there's
only
one
real
matter
in
dispute
and
that
matter
is
admittedly
a
maritime
matter.
and
we
think
if
the
rules
are
to
be
--
are
construed
as
barring
the
local
rules,
as
barring
a
full
disposition
of
the
controversy
in
that
situation,
that
they
would
run
counter
to
the
basic
policy
of
the
general
admiralty
rules
which
is
to
promote
the
effective
and
fair
disposition
of
maritime
matters
in
a
single
case.
i
am
going
to
have
to
rest
as
to
the
interest
question
on
the
government's
brief,
your
honor.
