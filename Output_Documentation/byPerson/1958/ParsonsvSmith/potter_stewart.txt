so
the
--
the
total
amount
of
depletion,
of
the
--
of
the
depletion
deduction
would
be
the
same
in
either
case.
it
would
be
5%
of
$4.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
assuming
that
--
which
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
would
make
sense,
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
if
my
arithmetic
is
right,
that's
20
cents
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
--
and
the
only
question
is
whether
you
take
a
dime
of
the
depletion
per
ton
and
the
owner
takes
a
dime,
or
whether
he
gets
full
20
cents.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
more
than
5%
of
the
gross
income.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
did
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
generally
speaking,
the
--
the
government's
position
here
is
that
of
a
stakeholder
except
insofar
as
the
owner
and
the
--
and
the
strip
mine
contractor,
whatever
--
whatever
your
client
is
called,
might
have
different
--
might
be
taxed
to
different
rates,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
if
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact,
if
this
court
should
agree
with
you
with
your
position,
wouldn't
it
be
very
easy
for
the
parties
to
just
change
the
labels
and
terminology
in
the
written
agreement
and
have
the
--
have
the
stripper
pay
a
dollar
for
something
that
was
called
a
“license
subject
to
cancellation,”
dress
it
up
as
over
a
property
right,
would
then
in
--
by
practical
fact,
should
be
the
same
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
now
under
the
--
under
the
regulations,
as
i
understand
them,
even
if
one
party
does
have
the
power
to
revoke
so
long
as
it's
--
that
--
that
there's
at
least
a
year
is
irrevocable
relationship
provided
why
this
deduction
is
available,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
this
one
year
period?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
let
me
ask
you
one
other
practical
question,
mr.
heffron,
if
i
may.
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
understand
of
course
why
it
is
important
to
the
government
that
this
issue
be
decided.
there's
been
a
conflict
and
confusion
in
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts.
it's
important
to
the
government
that
an
answer
be
given
to
why
does
the
government
press
so
strongly
that
the
answer
you
suggest
be
given,
isn't
it
--
isn't
an
answer
the
only
thing
that
the
government
is
actually
interested
in?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
say,
there's
a
lot
of
confusion
consistently
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
