justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you've
defined
things
so
well.
would
you
define
the
dragline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
dragline.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it's
just
--
is
that
the
word
--
that
was
used?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
all
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
what
did
he
get
--
on
your
example,
did
he
get
it
on
$4
or
$2
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
as
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
put
any
label
to
that
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
interest
that
you
acquired?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i'm
thinking
about
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
to
you.
you
said
that
you
had
"an
interest"
in
the
coal
as
i
understood
it,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
interest
in
the
coal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
not
true
as
to
the
coal,
i
understand,
which
actually
was
stripped.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
to
that
--
to
that
extent
of
your
argument,
that
would
be
true
only
as
to
the
coal
remaining
in
place
on
the
effect
of
date
of
the
termination,
isn't
that
so?
anything
that
had
been
brought
to
the
surface,
they
were
still
entitled
to
deliver
and
receive
the
stipulated
compensation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
heffron,
as
--
as
i
understand
it
under
each
of
these
contracts,
the
risk
at
least
to
the
extent
of
--
extent
of
expenses
are
was
entirely
the
stripper's,
isn't
it?
if
he
doesn't
find
coal,
he
gets
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
give
any
weight
at
all
on
the
issue
of
economic
burden
to
the
fact
that
he
carries
that
list?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
saying
then
that
it
in
fact,
it
was
impossible
not
to
find
coals,
the
operation
started.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
are
not
concerned
(inaudible)
and
that
provision
is
act
of
relation
to
leases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
far
as
(inaudible)
he
has
no
interest
that
he
can
sell
his
right
to
strip
and
can't
sell
to
someone
else?
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
coal
itself.
