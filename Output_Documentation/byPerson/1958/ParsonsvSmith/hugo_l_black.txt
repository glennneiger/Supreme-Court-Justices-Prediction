you
put
any
label
on
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
my
recollection
directly,
they
were
indispensable
to
this
--
to
the
work
they've
done
there
and
their
property
was
indispensable
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
could
it
have
been
produced
without
excess
to
and
from
their
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you,
in
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there,
this
was
a
part
of
the
setup
itself.
it
was
a
--
he
had
an
asset
there
and
that
he
was
a
part
of
it
just
as
much
as
though
he
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
are
other
men
on
--
over
--
on
that
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
owned
the
part
of
the
assets
as
i
recall
it.
i
have
read
it.
he
owned
the
part
of
assets
which
were
indispensable
for
the
production
of
that
oil.
and
the
more
oil
that
is
produced,
the
less
his
land
would
be
worth,
so
it's
wasted
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
owned
the
part
--
he
owned
the
part
of
the
property
that
was
indispensable
for
the
production
of
the
oil.
suppose
if
--
if
the
company
had
owned
all
that,
they
would've
used
it
just
as
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
he
actually
sustained
a
law
in
connection
with
the
assets
that
were
utilized
both
for
the
production
over
the
properties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
a
coal
miner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
the
coal
miner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
--
he
have
an
interest
to
that
extent,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
was
his
own
account,
he'd
get
some
wages
for
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
loses
that
interest.
if
he
loses
--
if
there
--
all
that's
depleted,
he
loses
his
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
clause
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
didn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
take
--
take
your
time.
i've
looked
at
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
admin
in
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
under

on
page

which
says
reading
in
its
discretion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
case
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
involved
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
contention
here
on
either
case
is
why
the
lease
was
under
that
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
contention
here
in
either
case
that
this
should
be
treated
as
a
lease
under
that
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
your
test
in
simple
words?
is
it
did
the
regulation?
you
think
that
is
a
sufficient
definition
of
--
of
a
boundary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
saying
for
a
test
that

definitely
