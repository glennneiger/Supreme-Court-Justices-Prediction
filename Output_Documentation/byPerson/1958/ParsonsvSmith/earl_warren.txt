mr.
mcdowell
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suggest
you
keep
track
of
your
own
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
we
can't
do
that
for
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
share,
mr.
--
as
you
see
it,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me?
suppose
your
--
your
client
employed
an
independent
contractor
to
do
a
certain
portion
of
his
--
his
job
such
as
the
trucking
or
loading
cars
or
something
of
that
kind,
would
he
be
entitled
to
a
share
of
the
depletion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
if
--
if
that
portion
of
your
--
of
your
obligation
under
the
contract
is
not
mining,
how
would
you
be
entitled
to
a
depletion?
why
should
you
be
entitled
to
a
depletion
for
that
portion
of
your
--
of
your
work?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
there
is
mining
or
not?
i
mean,
on
those
parts
of
the
operation,
your
operations
that
are
not
mining,
you're
entitled
to
--
according
to
your
theory,
you're
entitled
to
depletion
on
that
the
same
as
you
are
on
the
portion
that
does
constitute
mining?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
parceled
any
of
that
out
to
anybody,
it
--
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
depletion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcdowell,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
of
course,
i
--
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
finding
of
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
finding
number
30
that
on
page
34
which
said
reading
in
its
discretion
could
entirely
cancel
and
terminate
the
contracts
prior
to
the
completion
of
the
stripping
by
giving
30
days
written
notice
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
plaintiffs
of
his
intention
to
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
article
23
in
the
contract,
the
suspension
of
work
is
ambiguous
or
uncertain
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
haven't
read
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
heffron.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
he
doesn't
have
the
right
either
to
--
to
determine
for
himself
how
much
he
will
uncover
before
he
starts
to
mine
any
coal,
he'd
rather
be
--
if
he
didn't
bring
any
coal
up
for
the
--
for
the
coal
company
and
did
nothing
but
uncover
the
strips
so
he
could
exhaust
them
in
the
future.
i
suppose
they'll
terminate
the
contract
on
him,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
why
he
wouldn't
have
--
he
wouldn't
have
control
to
exhaustion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
never
plan
to
--
to
go
to
exhaustion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
position
regarding
that
article
23
that
--
which
is
the
termination
clause
of
the
contract?
is
that
ambiguous
in
your
opinion
so
that
it
cause
relentless
to
--
to
establish
its
meaning,
or
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
that
does
express
the
true
will
of
the
parties?

justice
