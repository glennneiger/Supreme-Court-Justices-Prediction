mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
see
this
case,
it
comes
down
to
a
search
for
some
capital
investment
that
the
strippers
made
in
the
mineral
in
place
here
which
would
give
rise
to
a
right
to
depletion.
the
statute
is
designed
to
return
to
the
taxpayer
his
capital
represented
by
the
wasting
mineral
asset.
the
theory
being,
as
justice
brandeis
stated
speaking
for
the
court,
that
depletion
is
like
depreciation.
the
taxpayer
has
an
asset
represented
by
the
mineral.
as
that
asset
is
converted
into
cash,
a
portion
of
the
cash
represents
a
return
of
his
capital.
it
would
be
unfair
to
tax
him
on
those
proceeds
without
granting
to
him
an
offsetting
deduction.
so
that
it
comes
down
to
this
as
we
see
it.
did
the
taxpayer
have
that
kind
of
ownership
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place
which
entitles
him
to
say,
at
least
in
part,
this
was
my
mineral?
and
as
it
is
wasted,
as
it
is
exhausted,
it
is
unfair
to
tax
me
on
the
proceeds
i
have
obtained
in
connection
with
that
mineral
without
granting
the
deduction.
now,
the
statute,
insofar
as
it
deals
with
the
question
of
the
parties
who
are
entitled
to
the
depletion
deduction,
says
only
the
following.
in
the
case
of
leases,
the
deduction
shall
be
equitably
apportioned
between
the
lessor
and
the
lessee.
that
is
the
fountainhead
of
the
law
on
this
subject
as
we
have
it.
now,
as
it
is,
that
section
of
the
statute
merely
reiterates
what
this
court
had
already
held
before
it
was
even
enacted
into
law.
in
lynch
and
all
work
stevens,
this
court
stated
dealing
with
the
case
of
a
lessee,
the
lessee
is
entitled
to
depletion
because
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
deposits
and
the
valuable
right
of
removing
and
reducing
the
ore
to
ownership
is
a
very
real
and
substantial
interest
therein,
it
is
property.
and
so,
we
say
that
is
precisely
what
the
statute
enacted.
the
rule
of
the
taxpayer
must
show
he
has
a
real
and
substantial
interest
which
is
property
as
represented
by
a
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
in
place.
now,
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
taxpayers
made
various
claims
in
contesting
each
other's
rights
to
the
depletion
deduction.
lessors
argue
that
lessees
were
not
entitled
to
it
because
under
state
law,
title
had
not
passed
to
the
mineral
and
title
was
a
material
factor.
it
was
arguments
of
that
type
which
were
the
occasion
for
this
court
to
formulate
the
economic
interest
test.
and
what
we
think
the
court
was
in
effect
reaching
for
was
a
method
of
formulation
which
would
describe
the
economic
attributes
of
ownership
held
by
the
taxpayer
which
made
it
only
fair
that
he
receive
depletion,
although
he
might
not
have
the
particular
legal
incidence
of
title
which
might
be
required
under
any
particular
state
law.
now,
the
economic
interest
test,
in
fact,
was
stated
by
this
court
in
palmer
and
bender,
which
was
a
case
where
precisely
that
sort
of
argument
was
made.
and
the
economic
interest
test
was
restated
by
this
court
time
and
again
in
cases
dealing
with
lessees,
sublessees,
sublessors,
assignees.
and
the
court
said,
“if
you
have
an
economic
interest
in
the
mineral,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
legal
incidence
of
title
here.”
now,
as
we
see
it
then,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
to
determine
whether
the
incidence
of
ownership
which
the
taxpayer
can
be
said
to
have
acquired
over
the
mineral
in
place,
place
him
in
a
position
similar
to
that
of
the
lessor
or
lessee
so
that
it
can
fairly
be
stated
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
in
place
which
makes
it
fair
that
he
be
given
a
return
of
capital
tax-free
as
represented
by
the
proceeds
of
the
coal.
now,
when
we
turn
to
the
specific
facts
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
of
a
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir,
in
these
cases
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
we
have
a
situation.
persons
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
strip
mining.
their
job
is
to
remove
coal
for
the
owner.
their
job
is
then
having
removed
it
to
turn
it
over
to
the
owner
and
to
be
paid
a
fixed
price
for
the
services
which
they
rendered.
and
the
taxpayers
here
assert
that
that
right
to
do
a
job,
a
right
which
in
itself
is
terminable
at
will
by
the
other
side,
a
right
which
contains
no
control
over
the
mineral
itself,
which
grants
no
right
of
disposition
over
the
mineral.
that
the
rights
which
the
taxpayers
acquired
under
these
contracts
if
they
can
be
termed
rights
such
as
to
entitle
them
to
depletion.
now,
the
question
here
as
we
see
it
is
the
nature
of
the
interest
acquired
by
the
taxpayers.
now,
turning
first
to
the
terminable
feature
of
these
contracts,
we
say
that
that
factor
in
and
of
itself
shows
that
the
taxpayers
had
nothing
to
deplete
here.
whatever
connection
they
had
with
the
mineral,
since
it
could
be
turned
off
at
any
time
by
the
owner
of
the
property,
they
had
no
real
nexus
with
the
mineral
in
place.
they
had
no
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place.
they
can
point
to
nothing
for
that
reason
which
can
be
depleted.
the
application
of
such
a
test
here
is
substantially
similar
to
the
kind
of
test
this
court
has
applied
in
dealing
with
other
kinds
of
transfers
because
essentially,
the
taxpayers
are
arguing
here
that
they
are
transferees
of
some
kind
of
an
interest
in
the
property,
an
economic
interest.
now,
this
court
has
said
in
many
other
context
that
the
right,
the
retention
of
an
absolute
power
to
revoke
the
transaction
renders
that
transaction
illusory
for
tax
purposes.
there
has
been
no
substantial
transfer
if
the
donor
may
revoke
the
gift
at
any
time.
there
has
been
no
substantial
transfer
--
transfer
--
the
transferor
entrust,
may
cancel
and
revoke
the
trust
at
any
time.he
is
still
taxed
on
the
income.
he
hasn't
disposed
off
the
property.
it
remains
in
his
gross
estate.
and
so,
we
say
here
that
the
retention
of
the
absolute
power
to
revoke
in
effect
renders
any
transfer
here
illusory.
the
taxpayers
got
nothing.
they
got
nothing
because
the
other
side
could
always
take
it
back
and
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
your
honor
pleases,
as
to
the
coal
which
actually
was
stripped
in
the
one
case,
the
taxpayers
did
retain
the
right
to
deliver
that
coal.
however,
in
the
event
that
that
did
occur,
of
course,
the
taxpayer's
rights
with
respect
to
the
track
would
have
terminated.
at
the
time
the
taxpayers
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
parsons
case,
if
your
honor
pleases.
when
the
power
to
terminate
with
--
were
exercised,
the
taxpayers
would
have
the
right
to
take
any
coal
which
had
actually
been
uncovered
and
turn
it
over
to
the
owner
and
receive
their
pay,
and
in
that
case,
leave
the
premises.
they
would
be
finished
if
that
right
were
exercised.
however
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
if
your
honor
please,
if
there
had
been
no
termination
clause,
we
think
the
case
would
have
been
a
better
one
for
the
strippers
to
argue.
but
we
say
that
there
are
other
factors
in
this
case
which,
nevertheless,
militate
against
the
transfer
of
an
interest
in
the
mineral.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
your
honor
pleases,
when
the
--
what
that
provision
meant
was
that
when
the
stripper
had
been
working
on
the
track
and
he
had
removed
the
overburden
on
any
particular
strip,
if
at
that
time
the
power
of
termination
was
exercised
since
he
would
have
had
that
kind
of
an
outlay
in
removing
the
overburden
which
is
the
major
part
of
the
job,
he
ought
to
be
able
to
collect
for
the
coal
which
he
actually
uncovered.
it
went
no
more
than
that.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
would
again
depend
upon
how
much
overburden
he
had
in
fact
removed.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
he
could
remove
that
coal.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that
man
knows
that
he
has
the
right
to
mine
all
of
the
mineral
deposit
to
exhaustion.
it
is
subject
to
no
one
else's
unfettered
command.
he
has
the
undisputed
control
over
it.
now,
if
we
examine
that
the
same
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
as
we
see
it,
while
the
stripper
mined,
he
at
no
time
was
assured
that
he
could
mine
the
track
to
exhaustion.
he
was
at
no
time
assured
that
he
could
mine
the
mineral
deposit
to
exhaustion.
all
he
was
assured
of
was
that
to
the
extent
that
he
had
uncovered
any
particular
segment
to
that
extent,
he
could
conclude
and
remove
the
coal.
but
insofar
as
we're
talking
about
the
areas,
and
there
are
many
different
mining
areas
which
are
involved
here
covered
by
the
oral
agreement,
insofar
as
those
mineral
deposits
are
concerned,
the
stripper
at
no
time
had
the
unrestricted
power
to
remove
all
of
the
coal
in
place.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
say
that
is
in
fact
what
was
done
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
as
a
practical
and
economic
matter,
the
stripper
would
be
concerned
with
the
ratio
of
removal
of
overburden
to
coal
which
he
found.
and
in
order
to
assure
that
he
had
an
economic
operation,
he
would
insist
upon
removing
such
coal
as
he
found
and
derive
the
revenues
from
that
coal
or
else,
he
could
never
know
whether
he
were
removing
overburden
over
a
seam
of
coal
which
it
was
uneconomical
to
remove
the
overburden
from.
he
would,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
minute
he
hit
upon
a
seam
of
coal
which
showed
that
it
was
of
the
extent
and
depth
such
as
to
make
it
economical
in
fact
to
remove,
he
would
remove
it.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
as
a
--
as
a
theoretical
matter,
that
would
undoubtedly
be
so
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
mining
area
which
was
so
small
that
within
10
days,
the
stripper
would
in
fact
have
removed
all
of
the
overburden.
because
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
mining
area
as
is
the
case
here,
that
within
a
10-day
period,
the
stripper
could
not
conceivably
have
removed
any
significant
portion
of
the
overburden,
he
of
course
then
would
have
no
right
whatever
to
that
vast
bulk
of
the
deposit
which
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
at
all.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
precisely,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
first
to
indicate
just
what
type
of
a
risk
it
was.
these
strippers
were
not
in
the
stereotype
picture
of
the
prospector
who
goes
out
in
the
desert
with
the
shovel
on
his
back.
these
strippers
were
dealing
with
known
coal
fields.
the
coal
fields
had
all
been
drilled.
they
had
all
been
surveyed.
some
portions
of
them
had
been
deep
mined.
in
one
instance,
a
portion
of
it
had
been
strip
mined.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
these
--
the
strippers
knew
that
there
was
coal
here.
in
fact
in
one
instance,
the
stripper
said
he
didn't
have
to
go
out
on
the
track
and
make
any
inspection
himself.
he
knew
there
was
coal
there.
and
the
court
in
fact
found
that
the
risk,
if
any
there
was,
was
minimal,
so
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
situation
where
the
risk
element
is
any
significant
factor.
but
in
any
event,
the
same
type
of
argument,
the
same
type
of
formulation
has
been
placed
before
the
court
before
in
other
cases
which
have
been
argued,
and
the
court
has
answered
time
and
time
again
that
the
statute
and
its
purpose
was
not
to
reward
the
risks
of
mining
but
rather
to
permit
the
taxpayer
a
tax-free
return
of
his
capital
because
his
asset
had
in
fact
been
exhausted.
and
this
court
in
the
bankline
oil
case
specifically
made
that
formulation.
we're
not
here
concerned
with
the
risk
of
mining,
we
are
concerned
with
a
return
to
the
taxpayer
of
his
capital
investment
in
the
mineral.
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
he
has
acquired
such
a
capital
investment
in
the
mineral
in
place.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
by
that
provision,
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
do
not
have
a
lease
here.
that
is
correct.
and
we
say
that
because
the
taxpayers
are
neither
lessees
nor
holders
of
any
of
the
substantial
attributes
of
ownership
which
would
place
them
in
a
situation
substantially
similar
to
lessees
but
there's
no
authorization
for
an
award
of
the
depletion
deduction
to
them.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
we
--
we
would
say
how
--
whatever
dress
we'd
put
upon
it,
if
one
side
reserved
the
absolute
power
to
revoke
without
cause
as
was
done
in
these
cases,
there
would
be
no
transfer;
that
the
whole
transaction
so
far
as
the
transfer
of
an
economic
interest
in
the
mineral
would
be
illusory.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
regulations
themselves
don't
deal
with
this
question
at
all.
the
regulations
simply
repeat
the
economic
interest
test
that
this
court
enunciated
in
precisely
the
same
language
stated
in
the
opinion,
so
that
so
far
as
the
regulations
are
concerned,
we're
still
dealing
with
the
judicial
gloss
that
has
been
placed
upon
the
statute
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
think
counsel
is
referring
to
a
gcm
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
in
one
sense
i
think
that's
true,
sir.
but
in
another
sense,
we're
pressing
for
an
answer
which
we
think
is
the
answer
authorized
by
the
statute
and
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
we're
pressing
for
an
answer
which
we
think
would
provide
a
test
which
will
resolve
many
of
the
difficulties
which
have
arisen
in
the
circuit
courts
and
in
cases
now
pending.
we
think
that
the
answer
we
request
here
in
essence
returns
to
the
framework
of
the
statute
itself
and
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
result
which
the
taxpayers
press
upon
the
court
here
as
a
result
which
in
effect
states
that
anyone
who
derives
income
from
the
extraction
of
a
mineral
shall
be
entitled
to
depletion
regardless
of
whether
he
owns
the
mineral,
regardless
of
whether
he
invested
in
the
mineral.
anyone
in
fact
connected
with
the
production
of
the
mineral
itself
is
entitled
to
a
depletion
deduction,
and
of
course
in
these
cases,
the
proceeds
which
the
taxpayers
receive
from
the
owner
of
the
coal
lands
were
in
no
sense
intended
to
compensate
the
taxpayers
for
the
wasting
of
their
--
of
any
asset
they
held
in
the
coal,
they
were
intended
to
compensate
the
taxpayers
for
the
services
rendered
and
the
use
of
their
equipment.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
as
i
said
it,
if
your
honor
please,
before,
the
regulation
simply
paraphrases
almost
directly
quotes
from
the
language
of
this
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
oh,
not
a
test
which
we
conceive
as
different
from
the
test
already
applied
by
this
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
it's
a
test
which
has
done
that
only
because
--
only
in
this
context,
in
the
context
of
the
strip
mining
contract.
it's
a
test
which
has
been
applied,
we
think,
with
some
degree
of
success
in
the
other
context
it
has
arisen.
and
we
think
it's
only
because
the
taxpayers
have
relied
upon
certain
phrases
and
picked
them
out
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
that
there's
been
any
difficulty
with
it.
as
we
understand
this
test,
and
when
we
said
it
in
the
framework
of
the
actual
factual
problem
which
was
presented
to
the
court
in
those
cases,
it's
a
test
which
we
think
clearly
applies
in
this
situation.
i
mean,
granted,
it
is
a
generalized
formulation
and
to
the
extent
that
in
this
area
of
the
law,
we
deal
with
any
generalized
formulation,
someone
who
refrains
from
examining
the
particular
fact
which
provoked
the
generalization,
they
ran
a
foul
of
the
basic
purpose
of
the
rule.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
our
suggestion
in
this
case,
if
your
honor
pleases
is
to
return
to
the
basic
test
formulated
by
the
statute
and
in
effect
to
a
hold
that
the
words
“lessee”
in
the
statute
as
stated
in
palmer
and
bender
do
not
mean
legal
lessee
but
in
effect,
one
who
has
the
economic
incidence
of
the
lessee,
the
economic
ownership
that
a
lessee
has.
and
we
think
that
if
that
were
the
test,
it
would
be
a
relatively
simple
matter
to
apply
it
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
have
been
several.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
insofar
as
the
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion
is
concerned,
there
have
been
no
differences
of
opinion.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
i
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
think
if
the
--
we
think
that
the
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion
need
not
necessarily
be
the
automatic
test
here.
we
say
that,
for
example,
the
lessee
has
a
good
deal
more
than
the
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion;
he
has
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
proceeds
of
the
mining
process.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
right.
the
strippers
could
not
dispose
of
the
coal.
they
had
none
of
the
attributes
of
ownership
over
this
coal.
so
some
cases
below
have
placed
weight
on
whether
or
not
the
stripper
had
this
right
of
disposal
on
the
theory
that
the
lessee
and
the
substantial
attributes
of
ownership
include
more
than
just
the
right
to
mine
because
that
may
only
be
the
right
to
do
the
job.
it
includes
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
mineral
in
place,
which
is
essentially
the
capital
asset
which
theoretically
is
being
depleted
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
i
--
i
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
would
--
yes.
as
--
as
i
understand
it,
this
discussion
is
revolving
about
the
coal
which
has
actually
been
mined.
and
as
we
see
it,
although
the
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion
is
a
--
would
be
a
substantial
element
of
the
case
which
the
stripper
would
have
to
make,
we
say
that
it
goes
beyond
that.
the
lessee
has
rights
over
the
mineral
deposit
which
go
beyond
the
right
to
mine
it
to
exhaustion.
he
has
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
proceeds
as
he
sees
fit.
now,
the
stripper
in
this
case
has
no
right
to
dispose
of
the
proceeds
as
he
sees
fit.
he
has
no
unfettered
control
over
the
mineral
deposit.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
mean,
well,
it
would
be
one
thing
if
the
stripper
were
given
the
right
to
dispose
off
the
mineral,
he
would
then
have
all
the
substantial
attributes
of
ownership.
he
would
be
a
lessee
in
effect
if
he
then
chose
to
contract
to
dispose
of
the
entire
contents
of
the
mine
to
a
particular
purchaser.
it
would
be
another
matter,
we
think,
because
then
he
would
have
exercised
or
he
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
exercise
that
control
over
the
mineral
deposit.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
do,
if
your
honor
pleases,
if
i
may
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
then
i'll
just
state
it
again,
we
--
we
would
concede
that
the
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion
is
a
substantial
part
of
the
case
which
the
taxpayer
should
make.
and
we
think
that
whether
or
not
that
element
proves
dispositive
may
well
depend
upon
the
other
facts
which
are
in
the
case.
that's
why
i
hesitate
to
concede
that
automatically
and
in
every
case,
the
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion
would
dispose
of
the
question.
we
think
it
may
well
depend
upon
the
other
facts
which
are
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
if
there
were
no
other
facts,
the
--
the
taxpayer
would
have
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
you
would
probably
have
the
right
to
depletion.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
we're
dealing
with
the
case
where
the
strip
is
the
mineral
deposit
and
the
taxpayer
in
fact
has
the
right
to
mine
that
strip
as
the
mineral
deposit
to
exhaustion,
i
--
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
justice
harlan.
but
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
case
where
the
stripper
does
not
have
unfettered
control
over
the
mineral
deposit,
and
such
control
as
he
has
is
limited
to
what
he
can
remove
from
the
overburden
in
which
he
has
removed.
we
think
that's
a
different
case.
i
--
i
think
if
i
understand
your
honor's
harking
back
to
the
question
you
put
a
little
while
ago.
we
say
in
that
case,
the
stripper
at
no
time
has
unfettered
control
over
the
mineral
deposit.
such
rights
as
he
does
have,
is
subject
to
the
--
to
revocation
by
the
coal
company
at
any
time.
consequently,
he
cannot
point
to
any
portion
of
this
mineral
deposit
and
say,
“i
have
a
right
to
it.”
the
best
he
can
do
is
say,
“if
i
have
removed
the
overburden
from
this
area,
the
coal
company
cannot
get
the
benefit
of
my
services
for
nothing.
they
have
to
pay
me
for
it
and
then
i
pull
out.”
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
could
never
plan
on
removing
the
coal.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
in
fact,
in
one
of
these
cases,
in
the
parsons
case,
the
record
shows
that
the
stripper
was
offered
a
written
contract
and
the
stripper
said,
“no,
i
don't
want
a
written
contract.
i
want
an
oral
contract
which
is
terminable
at
will
so
that
i
can
move
to
more
profitable
lines
of
endeavor
in
road
building
if
they
come
up.”
so
that
in
this
--
in
the
parsons
case
at
least,
not
only
do
we
have
the
case
where
the
coal
company
can
take
it
back,
we
have
a
case
where
the
stripper
didn't
want
to
be
tied
to
the
mineral
deposit.
he
wanted
to
be
free
to
remove
himself.
we
think
that's
another
fact
which
shows
the
lack
of
nexus
which
the
stripper
had
to
the
mineral
deposit.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
--
that's
correct.
if
the
--
if
the
taxpayers
were
here
contesting
the
right
to
depletion
on
the
amount
of
coal
which
they
had
in
fact
uncovered
and
as
to
which
the
coal
company
had
in
fact
invoked
the
right
of
revocation,
the
case
might
be
a
different
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
--
the
ultimate
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
phrased
in
that
term.
“does
the
stripper
have
an
economic
interest
in
the
mineral
deposit?”
and
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
tests
or
one
of
the
constituents
in
that
ultimate
finding
has
been
stated
by
this
court
as
did
the
taxpayer,
acquired
by
investment,
any
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place.
and
we
say
that
the
right
of
termination
affects
a
decision
on
whether
the
stripper
has
complied
with
that
requirement
of
attaining
an
economic
interest.
there's
been
some
question
raised
in
the
huss
case
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact,
the
coal
company
retained
the
30-day
right
of
termination,
which
is
explicitly
set
forth
in
four
of
its
written
contracts.
and
whether
it
retained
the
absolute
right
of
termination
with
no
notice,
which
was
explicitly
set
forth
in
another
of
the
contract.
that
is
the
same
kind
of
factual
contention
which
these
taxpayers
made
to
the
district
court
and
lost.
they
made
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
lost.
they
made
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
rehearing
and
they
lost.
and
we
think
that
the
finding
of
fact
which
has
been
sustained
so
many
times
ought
--
ought
to
set
the
matter
at
rest
here.
in
fact,
there
was
testimony
by
the
coal
company
that
they
had
very
good
reason
for
putting
these
termination
clauses
in.
they
wanted
to
protect
themselves
if
the
whole
operation
became
uneconomical
for
any
reason.
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
pull
out.
turning
to
the
southwest
case,
as
we
read
that
decision,
the
strippers
can
derive
no
comfort
from
it.
the
upland
owners,
we
submit,
were
in
an
entirely
different
position
vis-a-vis
the
mineral
than
the
strippers
here.
here,
before
the
agreements
were
signed,
the
strippers
had
no
interest
whatever
in
the
mineral.
we
submit
they
were
the
strangers
to
the
lease
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
southwest
case.
the
strangers
to
the
lease
which
this
court
said,
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
covering
by
its
decision
granting
depletion
to
the
upland
owners.
the
upland
owners
on
the
other
hand,
even
before
they
entered
into
any
agreement
with
the
actual
operator
of
the
oil
wells,
had
their
land
in
such
a
position
that
it
was
in
--
in
a
sense
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
oil
in
place
by
reason
of
the
situation
of
their
land.
so
that
the
southwest
case
as
we
understand
it
is
a
case
where
this
court
in
effect
held
that
the
taxpayers
had
an
interest
before
they
entered
the
arrangement
which
was
tantamount
to
an
economic
interest
because
their
land
was
so
situated
with
relation
to
the
oil,
that
their
land
had
a
proprietary
relationship
to
the
oil.
so
that
we
think
in
no
event
can
the
taxpayers
rely
upon
the
southwest
case
further
in
the
southwest
case
of
course,
as
--
as
was
already
been
indicated.
the
upland
owners
were
in
a
real
sense
indispensable
to
the
production
of
oil.
absent
the
upland
owners,
there
could
be
no
production
of
oil.
if
i
may
summarize
the
government's
position
here.
as
we
see
this
case,
the
taxpayers
have
failed
to
demonstrate
that
the
wasting
mineral
deposit
represents
a
capital
investment
of
theirs
and
that
is
the
language
which
this
court
has
formulated.
the
taxpayer
must
show
that
he
has
acquired
by
investment
an
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place.
now,
we
say
that
in
effect
means
that
the
taxpayer
must
convert
his
capital
from
one
form
into
another
form.
that
other
form
is
an
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place
because
the
taxpayer
here
at
no
time
had
unfettered
control
over
the
mineral
deposit
or
any
substantial
portion
of
it,
because
he
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
the
fruits
of
mining.
for
both
of
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
he
lacked
those
essential
attributes
of
ownership
which
can
be
summed
up
in
the
phrase
“a
capital
investment
or
capital
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place,”
and
therefore
he
should
be
denied
reversal.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
think
it
expresses
the
true
will
of
the
parties
and
that
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
district
court,
which
has
been
sustained
so
many
times,
resolves
all
doubts
as
to
the
explicit
language.
