mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
consolidation
of
these
cases,
counsel
for
the
petitioners
have
agreed
that
each
will
speak
for
25
minutes,
reserving
with
the
permission
of
the
court
10
minutes
of
the
allotted
time
for
rebuttal
argument
after
respondent
presents
his
case
which
will
be
made
by
mr.
berger.
these
cases
involved
the
right
of
coal
operator
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
i
understand
that
we
have.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
thank
you,
sir.
these
cases
involved
the
right
of
coal
operators
engaged
in
the
business
of
strip
mining
coal
to
present
its
depletion
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
is
not
only
the
first
case
involving
strip
miners
to
come
before
the
court,
but
to
our
knowledge,
it
is
the
first
case
ever
to
come
before
this
court
in
which
the
right
of
the
person
actually
producing
the
minerals
to
depletion
was
ever
challenged.
the
facts
in
both
cases
are
essentially
the
same.
i
will
state
the
facts
in
the
parsons
case
and
due
to
the
extent
there
are
differences,
mr.
berger
will
state
them
in
the
huss
case.
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
consider
briefly
the
operation
known
as
"strip
mining."
a
strip
miner
mines
from
the
surface
of
the
earth.
unlike
a
deep
miner,
he
does
not
drive
shafts
into
the
earth
to
reach
the
coal.
basically,
the
operation
is
performed
by
removing
the
earth
which
lies
over
the
coal
known
as
"overburden."
this
overburden
is
removed
by
making
massive
cuts
in
the
earth.
the
overburden
from
one
cut
being
deposited
into
the
adjacent
cut
from
which
the
coal
has
already
been
removed.
the
operation
resembles
to
a
degree
plowing
a
field
except
that
the
furrows
may
be
as
much
as
200
feet
deep.
strip
mining
of
course,
is
feasible
only
where
the
coal
does
not
lie
at
too
great
a
depth
beneath
the
surface,
and
also
the
thickness
of
the
seam
of
coal
has
a
bearing
because
it
is
profitable
to
remove
more
overburden
to
reach
a
thick
seam
than
a
thin
one.seams
of
coal
do
not
lie
or
run
at
a
uniform
depth
beneath
the
surface.
they
may
crop,
fault
or
pitch.
coal
crops
when
it
comes
to
the
surface
of
the
earth.
it
faults
where
the
vein
is
cut
off
beneath
the
surface
usually
by
a
rock
upheaval,
and
it
pitches
where
it
goes
into
the
earth
at
a
sharper
incline.
the
overburden
is
removed
in
several
ways,
by
scrapers
which
are
the
ordinary
road
scrapers
with
which
one
is
generally
familiar
by
high-lift
shovels
which
are
basically
the
standard
form
of
steam
shovel
with
a
little
longer
boom
to
enable
the
bucket
of
the
shovel
to
be
raised
to
a
greater
height.
in
other
words
the
high-lift
shovel
in
effect
digs
itself
down
into
a
hole
in
order
to
reach
the
coal.
and
lastly,
coal
is
removed
--
overburden
is
removed
by
the
use
of
draglines.
these
vary
in
size
but
basically,
they're
all
the
same.
they
operate
on
the
same
principle.
they
consist
of
a
machinery
housing
and
a
long
boom
perhaps
60
to
135
feet
from
which
is
suspended
a
huge
bucket
by
a
cable.
this
bucket
is
capable
of
removing
great
quantities
of
earth
at
one
scoop.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
sir
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
i
think
a
fair
answer
to
that,
sir,
would
be
that
bulldozers,
scrapers,
trucks
may
generally
be
used
in
--
in
road
building
and
in
other
instances
where
it
is
necessary
to
remove
quantities
of
earth.
a
dragline
is
generally
limited
to
a
stripping
operation,
although
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
remove
great
quantities
of
earth
in
a
road
building
operation,
i
presume
that
a
dragline
would
be
used
for
the
purpose.
draglines
are
customarily
used
in
coal
stripping
because
of
the
fact
that
they
do
remove
great
quantities
of
earth
with
one
scoop
or
bite,
and
also
because
they
can
work
at
practically
any
depth
because
of
the
fact
that
their
limitation
really
is
only
the
extent
of
the
cable
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
sir?
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
a
dragline?
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
d-r-a-g-l-i-n-e.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
i
--
i
think,
if
i
may,
that
the
definition
comes
from
the
fact
that
there's
a
long
boom
with
a
cable
and
a
bucket
is
suspended
from
it.
the
bucket
is
dropped
into
the
hole
in
the
earth.
the
machinery
draws
it
back
up.
in
other
words,
it
drags
it
up
on
the
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
--
cable
line.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
once
the
overburden
has
been
removed
exposing
the
coal,
the
coal
is
cleaned,
loosened
and
placed
usually
by
dynamiting
so
that
it
may
be
removed
from
the
vein.
this
removal
is
accomplished
by
placing
a
loading
shovel,
which
is
generally
a
steam
shovel
on
the
coal
in
place
bringing
trucks
down
into
the
cut
and
loading
the
trucks
with
the
steam
--
with
the
steam
shovel.
it's
obvious
of
course,
that
roads
must
be
built
for
this
operation
not
only
to
enable
the
strip
miner
to
move
his
heavy-duty
equipment
in
but
also
to
enable
the
coal
to
be
hauled
out
in
trucks.
in
the
parsons
case,
the
partnership
parsons
mined
the
coal
under
an
oral
contract
with
rockhill
coal
company,
the
owner
of
the
land.
this
contract,
is
what
is
known
in
the
industry
as
a
salvage
contract,
that
is
to
say,
parsons
bore
all
the
expenses
of
the
operation
and
furnished
the
equipment
and
received
payment
only
if
it
was
successful
in
discovering
and
extracting
marketable
coal.
parsons
was
paid
a
stated
price
per
ton
by
the
coal
company
on
whose
lands
they
were
operating.
the
contract
was
terminable
on
10
days
notice
by
either
party,
but
if
the
contract
was
terminated,
parsons
had
the
absolute
right
to
remove
and
be
paid
for
all
coal
which
he
had
uncovered
even
though
that
took
more
than
10
days.
parsons
had
the
exclusive
right
strip
areas
allocated
to
it.
parsons
controlled
the
amount
of
equipment,
the
number
of
workers
used
in
the
job,
and
the
quantity
of
coal
to
be
stripped.
the
value
of
the
equipment
used
on
the
job
by
parsons
ranged
from
$60,000
in
the
four-part
of
the
operation
to
as
high
as
$250,000
in
the
latter
part
of
the
operation.in
fact,
parsons'
agreement
was
never
terminated
by
the
landowner.
parsons
stripped
on
the
landowner's
land
continuously
for
over
eight
years.
the
stripping
ended
when
parsons
gave
the
landowner
notice
that
it
intended
to
cease
operations
after
30
days
if
that
was
satisfactory.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir,
it
was
mutual.
after
giving
the
notice
which
--
30
days
which
was
satisfactory
to
the
landowner,
rockhill,
parsons
ceased
operation
about
five
weeks
later,
which
was
the
time
required
to
remove
the
coal
it
had
been
cleared
of
overburden.
the
petitioners
brought
suit
upon
rejected
claims
for
refund
of
federal
income
tax
for
the
years
1945
through
1949.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
concluded
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
depletion
and
it
is
this
conclusion
which
is
before
this
court
for
review.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
petitioners
here
seek
only
a
share
of
the
depletion,
not
all
of
it.
this
is
so
because
the
statute
provides
for
a
deduction
of
a
--
for
depletion
in
the
form
of
a
flat
percentage
of
gross
income
from
the
property
which
is
defined
as
the
gross
income
from
mining.
there
is
no
dispute
here
as
to
the
gross
income
from
mining.
the
dispute
is
whether
the
strip
miner
who
mined
the
coal
is
entitled
to
percentage
depletion
on
his
share
of
that
gross
income
from
mining.
assume,
for
example
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
that
share
is
the
price
per
ton
he
received
from
the
landowner
for
the
coal.
in
other
words,
his
gross
income
from
mining,
your
honor,
would
be
--
if
he
will
pay
$1.50
a
ton
as
he
was
here
the
price
was
varied
upward,
but
his
gross
income
from
mining
in
respect
of
that
ton
of
coal
would
be
what
he
was
paid
for
it.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
perhaps
i
could
handle
that
by
an
example,
sir.
a
little
easier
than
using
the
actual
figures
but
the
principle
is
the
same.
let
us
assume
that
the
landowner
sold
the
coal
for
$4
a
ton.
now,
that's
the
gross
income
from
mining
because
at
that
point,
the
coal
goes
off
the
market.
let
us
also
assume
that
the
landowner
paid
the
strip
miner
who
mined
the
coal
$2
a
ton.
the
question
is
whether
the
landowner
is
entitled
to
percentage
depletion
on
$4
and
the
strip
miner
nothing.
or
whether
the
strip
miner
is
entitled
to
depletion
on
$2
which
is
his
gross
income
and
the
landowner
on
the
remaining
$2
of
the
gross
income
from
mining
after
deducting
what
he
has
paid
the
strip
miner
for
the
coal.
so
that
it
is
a
question
of
sharing
the
depletion
not
endeavoring
to
increase
the
depletion
dollar
above
$1
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
informed
that
he
got
it
on
$4
in
my
--
using
my
example.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir,
that
is
right.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
and
all
we
ask
is
a
share
of
the
5%
of
$4.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
we're
not
asking
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
20
cents,
yes,
sir.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
that
is
precisely
it,
sir.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
but
it
will
never
be
more
than
20
cents.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
now
however
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
that
is
correct.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
that's
how
the
pie
is
cut
up.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
that
is
--
that
is
essentially
correct,
sir.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
in
our
view
of
the
case,
he
would
not,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
he
would
not
be
engaged
in
mining.
we
were
engaged
in
mining
but
someone
that
may
be
hired
as
an
employee
or
may
perform
part
of
the
process
subsequent
to
the
actual
mining
is
not
engaged
in
mining
and
therefore
would
not
be
entitled
to
depletion.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
because
the
statute
your
honor
does
not
--
does
not
require
a
division
of
the
portion
of
the
work
that
is
performed.
if
we
are
in
the
business
of
mining,
we
derive
gross
income
from
mining
by
the
whole
of
the
operation
that
we
perform.
and
our
gross
income
from
that
your
honor
is
as
we
see
it,
what
we
get
paid
per
ton
for
the
coal
which
we
deliver
after
we
discover
it.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
i
--
if
i
may
put
it
this
way,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
all
mining
for
two
reasons.
one,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
to
say
that
delivering
the
coal
to
the
tipple
is
part
of
the
mining
but
beyond
that
there
is
a
very
elaborate
statutory
definition
of
the
process
of
mining
which
includes
a
number
of
treatment
processes
going
beyond
the
actual
process
of
digging
the
coal
out
of
the
ground
so
that
on
either
score,
as
i
see
it,
the
whole
of
it
would
be
mining,
the
whole
of
what
we
did.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
i
would
have
some
hesitancy
to
making
of
a
--
a
flat
agreement
because
i
think
that
it
would
depend
in
part
on
how
that
was
done.
but
to
the
extent
it
was
done
simply
by
virtue
of
our
engaging
somebody
to
perform
part
of
it,
my
answer
would
be,
"yes,
sir.
they
are
not
entitled
to
--
to
depletion."
now,
of
course
whether
the
strip
miner
is
entitled
to
this
share
of
depletion
we
seek
depends
upon
whether
he
has
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
an
economic
interest
in
the
coal
in
place.
first,
we
should
observe
that
economic
interest
does
not
mean
legal
title
to
or
ownership
of
the
coal.
indeed,
the
term
"economic
interest"
includes,
as
this
court
has
held
in
palmer
against
bender,
every
case
in
which
the
taxpayer
is
acquired
by
investment,
any
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place
and
secures
by
any
form
of
legal
relationship
income
derived
from
the
extraction
of
the
mineral
to
which
he
must
look
for
a
return
of
his
capital.
this
principle
was
most
recently
restated
by
this
court
in
the
commissioner
versus
southwest
exploration
company.
in
that
case,
a
--
an
oil
operator,
got
a
lease
from
the
state
to
drill
for
offshore
oil.
as
required
by
a
state
law
in
the
absence
of
an
artificial
--
a
natural
or
artificial
drilling
island
from
which
he
could
drill,
he
secured
the
right
from
the
adjacent
upland
owners
to
erect
drilling
equipment
on
their
lands
and
by
the
process
known
as
"whipstock
drilling"
reach
the
offshore
oil.
he
agreed
to
pay
the
upland
owners
a
stated
percentage
of
his
net
profits
for
the
right
to
use
their
land.
the
issue
before
this
court
was
whether
the
upland
owners
had
an
economic
interest
in
the
offshore
oil.
this
court
held
that
they
did,
that
the
upland
owners'
contribution,
their
land,
was
an
investment
in
the
oil
in
place
sufficient
to
establish
their
economic
interest.
their
income
was
dependent
solely
upon
production
and
the
value
of
their
interest
declined
with
each
barrel
of
oil
produced.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
if
i
might
answer
that
this
way,
your
honor.
actually,
there
were
contracts
made
there
in
that
case
with
five
upland
owners.
actually,
the
land
of
only
three
were
used
to
reach
the
oil
so
that
--
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
while
the
upland
owners
were
essential
as
a
class,
no
single
one
of
them
was
essential
to
--
to
make
it
possible
for
the
oil
deposit
to
be
reached.
the
requirements
as
we
stated
in
the
southwest
case
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
there
are
three.
first,
the
taxpayer
must
apply
by
investment
an
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place.
second,
he
must
derive
income
solely
from
production.
and
thirdly,
his
interest
must
decline
with
production.
the
petitioners
here
urged
that
we
meet
precisely
these
requirements.
first,
by
the
contracts,
we
acquired
an
interest
in
the
coal
namely,
the
right
to
mine
it,
and
be
paid
for
it.
this
interest
like
the
interest
of
the
upland
owners
in
the
southwest
case
was
essential
to
the
mining
operation.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
the
right
to
be
paid
for
the
coal,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
when
after
we
mined
it.
in
other
words,
we
took
the
risk
of
discovery
and
after
we
got
marketable
coal
above
the
ground
and
delivered
it
to
the
landowner,
we
were
paid
for
that
coal.
so
i
was
--
when
i
said
"it"
i
meant
coal.
yes,
sir.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
no,
sir.
we
had
no
title
as
such
to
the
coal.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
we
were
being
paid
for
work
because
you
have
to
have
regard
for
the
circumstance
under
which
this
arrangement
arises.
in
other
words,
we
received
absolutely
no
pay
unless,
under
the
salvage
contract,
unless
after
furnishing
all
of
the
equipment
and
doing
all
of
the
work
we
found
coal
that
was
marketable
and
delivered
it
to
the
owner.
our
position
is
that
the
contribution
of
the
strip
miner
who
does
the
mining
is
equally
essential
--
equally
as
essential
as
the
contribution
of
the
landowner
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
to
the
contribution?
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
no,
sir.
i
--
my
answer
would
be,
i
don't
think
a
label
is
necessary
because
the
court
has
said
by
any
equal
relationship
and
we
were
not
trespassers.
we
were
in
there
as
of
right
so
that
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessary
to
define
the
--
the
--
by
label
the
right
that
we
had
under
our
contract.
i
would
not
regard
it
as
important
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
our
position
is
that
we
had
an
interest
in
the
coal
in
the
same
--
in
the
same
way
in
which
the
upland
owners
in
the
southwest
case
were
regarded
as
having
an
interest
in
the
offshore
oil
that
was
out
beyond
their
--
the
actual
line
of
their
ownership.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
think
the
answer
is
this,
that
the
court
held
that
the
upland
owners
had
an
economic
interest
in
the
oil
in
place.
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
quotation
from
the
southwest
case
which
i
think
is
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
all
right.
but
you
will
find
in
there,
sir,
a
statement
to
the
effect
because
under
the
law
as
it
has
developed
in
this
court
under
these
economic
interest
decisions,
the
ultimate
conclusion
is
that
the
man
who
has
a
depletable
interest
has
an
economic
interest
in
the
mineral
in
place.
the
second
requirement
of
the
three
i
summarized,
namely,
that
our
income
must
be
dependent
upon
production
is
clearly
met
here,
and
as
we
understand
it,
the
respondent
has
conceded
that.
and
the
third
requirement,
namely,
that
the
interest
must
decline
in
value
as
the
coal
is
exhausted
is
likewise
met
here
because
with
each
ton
of
coal
removed,
the
strip
miners
were
that
--
there
remained
that
much
less
coal
from
which
the
strip
miners
might
thereafter
derive
income.
we
believe
that
perhaps
an
apt
way
of
demonstrating
our
position
that
the
strip
miners
in
this
case
had
an
economic
interest
in
the
coal
in
place
is
to
paraphrase
the
words
of
this
court
in
the
southwest
case
and
substitute
the
word
"strip
miners"
for
the
word
"upland
owners"
as
used
in
that
case.
here,
the
strip
miners
chose
to
contribute
their
organization
and
equipment
to
the
coal-stripping
venture
in
return
for
income
based
upon
production.
this
contribution
was
an
investment
in
the
coal
in
place
sufficient
to
establish
their
economic
interest.
their
income
was
dependent
entirely
upon
production
and
the
value
of
their
interest
decreased
with
each
ton
of
coal
produced.
no
more
is
required
by
any
of
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
mr.
justice
black,
their
property
was
indispensable
as
a
class
and
if
--
if
i
may
--
if
i
may,
sir
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
as
a
practical
matter,
no,
because
it
would've
been
too
expensive,
apparently.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir,
we
--
it
takes
a
coal
stripper
to
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
--
produce
this
coal.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
except
this
one
--
this
one
fact,
sir,
which
i
understand
from
the
case
there
were
five
upland
owners
from
whom
drill
sites
were
secured
and
ultimately,
wells
were
drilled
on
the
land
of
three,
so
that
the
oil
deposit
to
the
extent
of
the
oil
operator
desired
to
reach
it
was
reached
from
the
land
of
three
not
the
original
five
upland
owners.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
as
i
understand
it
--
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
clark,
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
lease
arrangement
which
the
oil
operator
made
with
the
state.
the
record
in
that
case,
i
believe,
discloses
that
it
was
stipulated
indeed
that
he
had
no
interest
in
that
lease.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
that
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
that
is
--
that
is
correct
sir,
because
as
i
understand
that
the
state
required
him
or
required
the
oil
operator
to
demonstrate
that
he
had
a
drill
site,
so
he
brought
his
agreement
in.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
but
of
course
you
understand,
mr.
justice
black,
that
he
didn't
sit
over
and
owned
any
of
the
oil
as
such.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
his
land
was
here
and
the
oil
was
offshore.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
sir.
well,
i
--
that
is
--
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
he
--
he
owns
something
which
in
those
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
but
we
maintain,
your
honor,
that
we
did
here
too
because
with
each
ton
of
coal
produced,
our
right
to
produce
coal
under
this
arrangement
necessarily
declined.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
you
mean
an
--
well
--
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
no,
sir.
a
coal
miner
would
be,
in
our
view
of
the
matter,
mr.
justice
black,
an
employee,
he
would
not
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
mining
for
his
own
account
as
these
strip
miners
were.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
well,
if
--
well,
to
that
extent,
yes,
right
--
right
so.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
yes,
but
he
is
not
deriving
gross
income
from
mining
sir,
in
the
sense
that
he
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
mining
as
an
entrepreneur.
he's
an
employee.
mr.
sherwin
t.
mcdowell
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
point,
if
i
may,
and
that
is
with
respect
to
determination
clause
in
this
contract.
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
under
our
contract
agreed
that
if
10-days
notice
was
given,
parsons
had
the
absolute
right
to
take
out
all
the
coal
it
had
been
uncovered
irrespective
of
how
long
that
required.
so
that
as
to
the
coal
which
was
actually
removed
and
the
coal
with
respect
to
which
depletion
is
sought,
our
contract
in
fact
was
not
terminal
because
the
minute
the
overburden
was
removed,
that
coal
was
coal
which
could
not
be
taken
away
from
us
by
termination
and
that
was
coal
which
we
had
the
absolute
right
to
take
out,
and
sell
to
the
landowner
for
the
stated
price.
