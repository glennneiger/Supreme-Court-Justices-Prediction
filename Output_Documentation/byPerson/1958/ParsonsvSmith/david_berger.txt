mr.
david
berger
mr.
mcdowell
has
concluded
his
argument,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
david
berger
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioners,
huss,
were
a
partnership
were
engaged
in
essentially
the
same
kind
of
stripping
and
mining
operation
which
was
described
by
my
colleague,
mr.
mcdowell.
now,
we
naturally
agree
with
his
outline
to
your
honors
of
the
law.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
which
is
here
involved
as
a
matter
of
law
entitles
the
petitioners
to
the
depletion
allowance.
and
we
have
printed
the
statute
in
our
appendix
at
page
20
of
our
brief
and
in
very
plain
language
defines
the
gross
income
as
to
which
the
5%
depletion
allowance
shall
be
made
as
gross
income
from
mining.
it
is
therefore
our
position
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
unchallenged,
i
may
add,
that
the
petitioners,
huss,
derived
over
$1.5
million
of
gross
income
for
the
years
1944
to
1947,
inclusive
from
mining
and
therefore,
are
within
the
plain
language
and
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
entitled
to
the
depletion
allowance.
a
question
was
asked
from
the
bench
this
morning
as
to
what
if
any
label
might
have
been
attached
to
the
interest
of
the
parties,
the
petitioners
here?
to
the
extent
that
we
have
written
contracts
in
this
case,
the
huss
case
differs
factually
from
the
parsons
case,
which
you
will
recall,
was
based
on
oral
--
an
oral
arrangement.
but
at
page
89
of
the
record,
your
honors
--
mr.
david
berger
oh
no,
sir.
no
sir.
it's
just
that
i
think
for
the
enlightenment
of
all
of
us,
it
would
be
well
to
refer
very
briefly
to
the
written
contract
which
was
one
of
six
executed
by
huss
in
this
case
and
which
i
think
very
clearly
demonstrates
and
indeed
beyond
for
adventure
of
doubt,
that
the
stripping
and
mining
operations
which
produced
the
income
here
were
mining
operations
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now,
the
contract
was
a
contract
and
this
is
the
label
put
on
it
by
the
coal
company,
owner
of
the
land,
and
drafted
by
the
lawyers
for
the
grantor
of
the
interest
which
we
had
here.
it
says,
“a
contract
for,”
and
i'm
quoting,
“stripping
and
mining
the
various
veins
on
the
north
and
south
depths
of
the
tower
city
section.”
and
then
it
goes
on
to
describe
what
the
project
is
as
a
salvage
stripping
project,
and
at
page
92
of
the
record
it
says,
“salvage
stripping
as
used
herein
shall
be
deemed
to
mean
a
project
wherein
coal
company
reserves
a
coal-bearing
area
for
contractor,
gives
contractor
permission
to
enter
upon
this
area
and
strip
it
and
agrees
to
pay
contractor
a
specified
amount
of
money
for
each
ton
of
raw
coal
that
he
delivers
to
coal
company.”
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
coal
company
assumes
no
responsibility
for
the
discovery
of
coal,
gives
the
contractor
no
guarantee
of
the
quantity
of
coal
in
the
stripping
area,
and
places
upon
contractor
all
risk
in
connection
with
the
prospecting,
discovery,
and
recovery
of
coal
in
the
operation
of
the
entire
stripping
project.
it
goes
on
to
require
huss
to
perform
all
work
required
for
the
prospecting,
discovery,
and
recovery
of
all
coal,
the
removal
of
overburden,
and
for
the
delivery
of
raw
coal
into
the
raw
coal
chute.
and
then
it
expressly
defines
on
page
94
the
scope
of
the
work
as
understood
by
the
parties
to
refer
to
everything
required
too.
now,
these
are
the
keywords,
extract,
process,
and
deliver
into
the
raw
coal
chute
at
westwood
breaker
or
of
the
raw
coal
that
is
recoverable
by
stripping.
and
so
we
have,
your
honors,
an
agreement
under
which
the
owner
of
the
coal
land
has
reserved
that
coal-bearing
track
for
the
contractor,
and
has
actually
given
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
an
exclusive
right
to
strip
and
mine
the
coal,
to
recover
all
the
coal
recoverable,
and
requires
itself
to
pay
by
taking
all
of
his
output
only
for
the
coal.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
a
cancellation
clause
in
our
written
agreement.
we
are
not
in
accord
with
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
who
said
that
this
cancellation
clause
was
operable
solely
within
the
discretion
of
the
coal
company.
we
think
the
record
shows
that
on
the
contrary,
that
before
huss
moved
his
very
substantial
equipment,
worked
in
the
end
approximately
$500,000,
he
asked
at
the
beginning
whether
or
not
this
clause
which
apparently
permitted
a
--
an
unqualified
termination
applied
to
him.
and
he
was
advised
that
it
didn't
because
it
was
something
that
was
put
in
there
as
a
precaution
to
protect
the
coal
company
against
unsatisfactory
strip
miners.
mr.
david
berger
that
clause
was
clause
--
well,
it's
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
it's
--
mr.
david
berger
it
--
we
have
a
clause.
it's
a
finding
of
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
david
berger
it
--
it's
in
there.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
david
berger
yes.
that
would
be
in
the
finding
of
fact.
finding
of
fact
number
--
mr.
david
berger
yes,
that's
a
finding
of
fact.
what
page
is
it,
90?
oh,
on
page
98,
my
colleague
advises
me,
article
23.
now,
it's
rather
lengthy
but
this
is
the
point
that
we
make
in
that
regard.
we
have
a
dual
point.
first,
that
in
respect
to
the
cancellation
clause,
if
you
read
this
agreement
through
and
i'm
sure,
your
honors'
leisure
will
--
your
leisure
will
be
able
to
do
that,
you
will
see
that
there
--
the
contractor
was
under
an
obligation
to
begin
work
within
30
days.
now,
the
record
shows
that
he
was
required
and
also
under
the
contract
to
strip
out
and
mine
out
all
of
the
coal
that
is
recoverable.
now
then,
it
is
our
position
that
the
practice
of
the
parties
in
respect
to
the
six
contracts
in
the
huss
case
demonstrates
that
they
did
not
regard
this
as
being
in
arrangement
unilaterally
terminable
by
reading.
but
on
the
contrary,
and
the
record
shows
this,
your
honor,
there
are
six
written
agreements
of
cancellation,
each
one
covering
each
of
the
six
contracts.
now,
however,
so
there'll
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
position
of
huss,
we
say
that
while
that
clause
was
not
applicable
to
huss
even
if
it
should
be
regarded
by
this
court
as
applicable
to
huss,
that
that
would
not
deprive
huss
of
the
right
of
depletion.
and
we
are
relying
upon
the
reasoning
and
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
uplands
case
to
which
reference
was
made.
now
--
mr.
david
berger
yes.
mr.
david
berger
i
have
--
i
--
i
agree,
sir,
that
the
--
the
trial
judge
found
that
as
a
fact.
i
maintained
that
under
rule
52
(a)
that
that's
a
clearly
erroneous
finding
because
if
one
reads
the
cancellation
language
in
connection
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
contract
and
with
the
practice
of
the
parties,
which
in
this
case
was
that
in
no
single
instance
had
there
been
a
unilateral
termination.
but
on
the
contrary,
there
had
been
written
agreements
of
cancellation
that
one
should
infer,
as
judge
kalodner
indicated
in
his
dissent
that
that
clause
really
was
inapplicable
to
huss.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
your
honor.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
david
berger
and
i've
made
--
i
tried
this
case,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
very
point
i
made
with
judge
van
dusen.
mr.
david
berger
now,
i
know
that.
that
was
the
main
--
that
was
the
point
i
maintained.
and
judge
van
dusen,
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
opinion
he
wrote,
took
the
position
that
i
failed
to
sustain
my
burden
of
proving
a
variance
from
what
he
call
a
written
provision
of
the
contract.
i
think
that
was
error
of
law
and
we've
maintained
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
wrong
and
on
the
petition
for
rehearing,
we
pointed
out
specifically,
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
mistake
as
to
the
content
of
the
record
because
judge
hastie
said,
“the
record
doesn't
indicate
why
the
cause
was
put
in.”
but
we
pointed
out,
and
judge
kalodner
made
note
of
that
in
his
dissent
why
it
was
put
in.
however,
regardless
of
that
question
of
facts,
sir,
we
strongly
urge
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
depletion
allowance
because
we
did
the
mining
here.
now,
let
us
analyze
for
a
moment
the
import,
if
any,
of
this
cancellation
clause
assuming
arguendo
that
we
are
bound
by
it.
first
of
all,
it
was
a
30-day
notice
provision.
now,
the
record
shows,
and
this
is
undisputed,
that
huss
mined
so
extensively
that
on
occasion,
he
had
50,000
tons
of
coal
on
the
surface
and
that
coal,
of
course
ultimately,
he
delivered
to
reading
for
which
he
received
the
stated
price
per
ton.
now,
certainly
no
one
can
deny
that
while
that
clause
remained
unexercised
that
he,
huss,
had
a
right
to
mine
the
coal.
and
the
contract
is
clear
that
had
the
coal
which
was
on
the
surface
been
destroyed
by
fire
or
flood
or
by
some
other
catastrophe,
that
huss
would
have
suffered
the
loss
and
not
ready
because
huss
was
not
entitled
to
one
penny
unless
he
stripped,
and
mined,
and
delivered
the
coal,
all
of
the
coal
to
the
raw
chute,
or
to
the
chutes
of
the
coal
company.
but
i
say
that
there's
a
more
important
reason
why
the
cancellation
clause
is
inoperative
here
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that
is
that
in
point
of
fact,
it
never
had
been
exercised.
and
we
must
consider
the
question
of
tax
liability
and
our
rights
as
of
the
time
when
the
end
of
the
tax
year
occurred.
now,
we
have
four
years
in
question
here,
your
honors,
1944
to
1947
inclusive.
it
is
a
fact
that
judge
kalodner
pointed
out
that
at
the
end
of
1944
when
we
had
a
gross
income
of
$520,000
from
our
stripping
mining
operations
that
this
clause
had
not
been
exercised.
and
therefore,
i
strongly
contend
that
we
were
entitled
to
take
a
5%
depletion
allowance.but
more
important,
it
never
was
exercised.
we
actually
mined
the
coal
to
exhaustion
and
judge
van
dusen
so
found.we
had
the
control
as
he
finds
in
his
extensive
findings
of
fact.
we
had
the
control
of
the
mining
operation.
now,
we've
come
back
to
the
question
of
terminability.
in
the
fourth
circuit
where
this
question
had
come
up
or
where
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
terminability
clause
applied
--
mr.
david
berger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
we
exhausted
these
tracks,
your
honor,
and
when
we
finished
the
mining,
each
time
we
finished
it,
we
entered
into
a
written
agreement
with
the
coal
company
cancelling
the
agreement.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
took
us
some
three
years
roughly
to
mine
out
and
exhaust
all
of
the
coal
here.
mr.
david
berger
i
think
it
is
dependent
upon
both,
sir.
i
say,
first,
that
is
dependent
upon
economic
interest;
that
we
had
an
economic
interest
the
minute
we
entered
into
the
contracts
with
reading.
we
were
granted
an
exclusive
right
to
mine.
coal
lands,
your
honors,
have
no
economic
value
absent
the
right
to
mine
the
coal.
so
we
had
that
economic
interest.moreover,
for
its
entire
income
was
derived
solely
from
the
extraction
and
delivery
of
the
coal.
for
example,
if
we
had
spent
$1,000,000
removing
overburden
and
had
come
up
with
nothing
but
slate,
we
would
not
have
been
paid
one
penny,
your
honor.
now,
as
to
the
terminability,
i
say
it
is
what
actually
happened
that
counts,
and
this
court
says
so.
i
rely
on
the
southwestern
exploration
case
wherein
this
court
declared
that
many
things
might
have
happened.
for
example,
the
contractor,
the
oil
driller
in
the
southwest
case
might
have
built
an
artificial
island
and
used
that
and
that
was
perfectly
proper
under
the
existing
law.
he
didn't
do
it.
there
were
five
upland
owners.he
might
have
selected
another
upland
owner.
he
did
not
select
another
one.
he
selected
the
taxpayer.
and
this
court
declared,
as
mr.
justice
clark
undoubtedly
recalls,
but
none
of
these
possibilities
occurred.
tax
viabilities
are
rights
depend
upon
realities.
mr.
david
berger
he
had
his
choices.
i
understand
the
fact,
sir,
among
several
upland
owners.
he
also
had
a
choice,
sir,
of
building
an
artificial
island
from
which
he
could
drill
the
oil
in
accordance
with
california
law.
moreover,
it
was
argued
in
that
case
by
south
--
by
southwest,
the
driller,
that
california
might
have
passed
the
statute
revoking
the
right
to
drill
oil
completely.
there
were
many
possibilities
of
terminability
in
that
case,
but
none
of
these
possibilities
occurred
and
neither
did
anyone
of
these
possibilities
if
they
existed
in
this
case
occur.
mr.
david
berger
it
is
my
position,
sir,
that
with
respect
to
the
coal
that
he
mined
before
termination.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
your
honor.
i
take
that
position
because
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
were
the
miners.
they
took
out
and
complied
with
the
laws
relating
to
permits
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
for
mining.
they
paid
the
employees,
they
built
roads,
they
built
houses
and
supply
buildings.
they
furnished
the
water.
they
furnished
the
power.
they
made
an
agreement
with
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
and
i
daresay
would
come
as
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
john
l.
lewis
to
hear,
as
the
government
suggested
in
this
case,
that
the
petitioners
here
were
mere
employees.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
mr.
david
berger
i
think
it
is
dependent
upon
two
things,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
first,
the
terms
of
the
grant
and
secondly,
upon
what
actually
happened.
but
where
you
have
a
conflict
if
it
does
exist,
and
in
my
mind
it
does
not,
then
i
say
that
that
conflict
should
be
resolved
by
this
court
in
terms
of
what
actually
happened
not
what
might
have
happened.
mr.
david
berger
your
honor,
that
would
depend
on
some
other
facts
which
you
have
not
stated
and
i
would
like
to
explain
my
answer
in
this
way,
sir.
that
we
must
return
to
the
statute.
i
think
that's
a
good
practice.
and
the
statute
says
you're
entitled
to
the
depletion
allowance
if
you'll
derive
gross
income
from
mining.
now,
in
your
case
you
would
have
to
tell
me
so
i
could
properly
answer
you,
who
got
the
permits
that
is
under
local
law?
who
is
the
one
who
complied
with
the
local
law?
who
bore
all
the
risks
of
mining?
who
acted
as
the
entrepreneur,
the
--
the
employer
all
the
way
down
the
line?
and
what
kind
of
a
right
did
he
get
from
the
owner
of
the
land?
and
in
this
case,
he
got
the
right,
the
exclusive
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion.
therefore,
i
would
say
he
got
an
economic
interest.
now,
may
i
say
another
word,
your
honors?
mr.
david
berger
to
the
extent
to
which
it
is
inconsistent
with
my
position,
i
say
it
is
incorrect
and
unsupported
by
the
statute
and
it's
plain
unambiguous
words.
may
i
say,
your
honors,
that
i
have
studied
these
cases
and
i
realized
that
the
concept
of
economic
interest
and
economic
advantage
is
as
has
been
referred
to
by
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court,
a
gossamer-like
concept.
but
it
is
my
belief
that
the
cases
are
not
that
as
difficult
as
they
appear
to
be,
that
they
really
breakdown
into
three
categories.
category
number
one
is
the
situation
where
the
taxpayer,
who
was
claiming
depletion
allowance,
is
the
entrepreneur
who
actually
drills
the
oil
or
mines
the
coal.
category
number
two
is
the
--
where
the
taxpayer
does
not
himself
drill
the
oil
or
mine
the
coal
but
by
virtue
of
a
legal
relationship
to
the
mineral,
maintains
control
over
its
production
to
a
certain
extent
and
derives
income
directly
from
the
oil
or
coal.
now,
category
number
three
is
where
the
taxpayer
has
some
sort
of
tenuous
connection
with
the
mineral
as
a
result
of
the
production
of
which
he
gets
some
income.
he
might
or
might
not.
now,
where
a
case
falls
within
category
number
one,
there
should
be
no
doubt
in
anyone's
mind
that
that
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
depletion
allowance
because
he
comes
plainly
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
difficulty
has
arisen
in
categories
two
and
three.
when
is
a
case
in
two
and
when
is
it
in
three?
this
court
has
given
the
ultimate
determination
or
a
label,
if
i
may
use
the
word,
by
saying
when
it
allows
the
depletion
allowance,
he
has
an
economic
interest
and
when
it
denies
it
he
has
only
an
economic
advantage.
now,
i
have
concluded
that
the
cases
which
gave
rise
to
the
doctrine
of
economic
advantage
in
this
court
were
cases
where
the
person
involved
did
not
do
the
mining,
did
not
do
the
drilling
for
oil,
but
got
some
kind
of
income
as
a
result
of
a
tenuous
connection
for
--
and
they
came
from
a
trilogy
of
cases
decided
on
the
same
day
by
this
court
20
years
ago.
and
these
cases
were
the
bankline,
the
elbe
case
and
the
o'donnell
case.
now,
the
bankline
case,
the
taxpayer
claimed
the
depletion
allowance
was
merely
a
man
who
bought
certain
number
of
barrels
of
gas.
that's
all
he
did
and
he
claimed
that
he
had
the
right
of
depletion
allowance.
this
court
said
he
doesn't.
i
would
say
that
a
man
who
bought
all
the
coal
after
it
was
finished
would
have
no
right
to
the
depletion
allowance,
a
coal
broker.
in
the
o'donnell
and
the
elbe
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
seller
of
stock
in
one
case
and
a
seller
of
land
in
another
where
the
--
where
the
seller
received
the
purchase
price
and
in
addition,
in
case
there
were
some
net
profits,
he
was
to
get
a
share
of
the
net
profits.
this
court
declared
in
all
of
those
three
cases
that
he
had
merely
an
economic
advantage
but
no
economic
interest.
mr.
david
berger
the
government
itself
says,
yes,
on
that
one.
the
internal
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
that
point
is
off
the
policy,
sir.
it
is
arbitrary
to
say,
yes,
for
one
year
but,
no,
for
11
months
and
30
days
or
29
days.
mr.
david
berger
well,
i
don't
think
it
was.
i
think
--
i
think
it
was
arbitrary,
sir.
for
example,
if
you
say
a
year
like
mr.
--
the
huss
has
actually
produced
more
in
the
shorter
period
of
time
than
parsons
did
in
a
longer
period.
and
this
will
depend
upon
so
many
factors
to
mention
in
my
limited
time
like
the
coal
itself,
the
kind
of
equipment.
and
i
personally
know
because
i
come
from
the
coal
regions
that
as
a
result
of
the
impact
of
mechanical
advancement,
the
rate
of
production
has
increased
enormously
so
that
today,
you
can
produce
more
in
one
day
than
you
used
to
be
able
to
produce
in
a
month.
if
your
honors
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
berger
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
david
berger
--
i
say
that
a
finding
of
fact
has
not
been
sustained
so
many
times.
and
if
your
honors
will
read
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit,
you
will
see
that
the
position
taken
by
the
majority
of
the
third
circuit
in
effect
was
this
whole
thing
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
trial
judge.
a
reasonable
man
could
reach
different
opinions,
different
results
on
the
same
evidence.
and
i
feel
that
that
was
not
a
correct
decision.
i
feel
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
were
right,
we
were
entitled
to
it.
that
they
are
winning
or
losing,
the
depletion
allowance
may
not
be
rested
or
based
in
the
uncontrolled
or
unreviewed
discretion
of
a
trial
judge,
that
if
we
took
judge
van
dusen,
we
lose
it,
but
if
we
got
judge
jackson,
we
might
win
it.
now,
secondly,
i'm
surprised
to
hear
government
counsel
say
that
he
--
he
offers
no
test
when
asked
by
this
court
what
is
a
test
if
my
test
of
mining
isn't
the
test.
on
page
32
of
the
government's
brief
they
set
forth
the
test.
and
it
is
conceited,
and
i'm
not
going
to
waste
my
time
for
rebuttal
in
reading
what
they
say
except
to
paraphrase
it
to
say.
and
as
i
read,
the
plain
language
of
page
32,
they
concede
that
a
stripper
may
have
an
economic
interest,
then
they
give
three
situations
in
anyone
of
which
he
will
have
such
an
economic
interest
as
to
entitle
him
to
depletion
allowance.
one,
to
mine
all
or
a
substantial
portion
of
the
track.
we
had
the
right
to
and
we
did
mined
all
of
the
track.
two,
to
extract
a
substantial
number
of
tons
of
the
mineral.
we
have
the
right
to
mine
to
exhaustion.
we
extracted
almost
a
million
tons
of
coal.
three,
to
continue
stripping
operations
for
a
sufficient
time
so
that
i
can
--
he
can
be
certain
of
being
able
to
remove
a
substantial
amount
of
coal.
that
is
in
the
alternative,
t
says
or
three.
we
had
that
right.
now,
even
if
our
right
were
subject
to
termination,
the
law
has
always
protected
contractual
relationships
terminable
at
will.
if
i
am
buying
merchandise
from
you,
sir,
and
a
third-party
should
interfere
with
my
purchasing
of
merchandise
from
you
even
though
i
may
terminate
it
myself,
that
right
can
be
actionable.
that
termination
can
be
--
that
interference
is
actionable.
the
restatement
of
torts
recognizes
that.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
that
quite
--
mr.
david
berger
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that,
sir,
and
i
have
to
concede
that.
and
the
reason
it
isn't
is
that
we
always
took
the
position
that
we
were
entitled
to
mine
to
exhaustion
and
we
did
mine
to
exhaustion.
we
never
went
into
that.
if
that
fact
is
essential
and
i'm
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
it,
i'll
prove
it.
i
don't
know
whether
--
in
whether
that
was
the
case
because
we
--
we
only
mined
to
exhaustion.
we
know
this
that
it
is
clear
in
this
record
that
there
are
over
50,000
tons
of
coal
very
frequently
stacked
up
on
the
surface
of
the
ground.
and
as
to
that
coal,
it
is
certainly
not
the
fact.
but
we
would
like
--
mr.
david
berger
it
may
--
it
may
on
this
record.
i
don't
know
if
it
does
in
fact
in
all
candor,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
yes.
well,
that
fact
was
not
previously
considered
to
be
one
of
relevance.
i
believe
that
in
--
in
summary,
sir,
that
the
--
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
page
16,
a
purpose
of
a
statute
is
to
award
the
--
where
a
person
who
takes
the
risk
of
prospecting
and
this
we
did
very
clearly.
there
are
economic
interest
in
all
cases
whether
we
call
this
a
lease
or
a
license
or
however
we
label
it,
is
the
right
to
mine.
this
we
had
in
exercise.
thank
you,
sirs.
