or
for
the
mining?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
have
any
title
as
such
to
the
coal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
now
do
you
get
paid
for
the
work,
were
you

as
the

depletion
amount
dependent
upon
what

happen?
in
fact
or
on
economic
interest
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
would
have
been
your
position
as
to
depletion
allowance
if
the
contract
had
been
terminated
within
the
60
days?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he'd
get
it
anyway?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
would
not
the
economic

they
have
one,
is
dependent
--
depends
on
what
they
may
have
done
to
which
was
now
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
they
assume
that
is
wholly
assumptious
that
one
does
to
prevent
that
of
such
economic
interest
(inaudible)
if
the
contract
is
terminable
here
at
will
or
arrived
from,
then
would
you
not
get
--
it
was
not
just
any
given
any
interest
that
the
contract
(inaudible)
justice

probably,
he
could
hold
on
to.
then,
under

(inaudible)
he
would
have
the
right

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
it
not
seem
very
well
thought
out
(inaudible)
removing
the

they're
not
selling
the

because
that
cost
money
picked
up
by

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
case
of
leases,
the
deduction
shall
be
equitably
apportioned.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
in
that
as
a
matter
of
abstract
law,
does
the
question
of
economic
interest
depend
upon
the
right
to
terminate
at
will
or
is
that
but
one
matters
in
determining
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
they
do
have
an
economic
interest?
