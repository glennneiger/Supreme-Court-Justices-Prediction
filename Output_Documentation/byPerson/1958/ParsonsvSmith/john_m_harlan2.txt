to
what
extent
is
the
equipment
that
you
use
you
need
for
strip
mining?
justice
john

as
distinguished
from
its
use

usability
and
generally
in
other
types
of
operation?
justice
john

the
right
to

was
it
mutual
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
be
the
share
the
owner
would
get?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wasn't
--
wasn't
that
a
situation
in
which
the
taxpayer
who
--
the
landowner
had
land
which
was
--
could
only
be
used
--
there
wasn't
any
other
land
that
could
be
used
for
this
offshore
drilling,
was
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
sir.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
was
no
suggestion
that
in
other
cases
the
--
the
contract
wasn't
intended
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
have
a
cancellation
clause?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
all
the
coal
been
mined
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
mined
to
exhaustion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
justice
whittaker.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
feel
were
the
language
of
the
regulation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
in
this
case,
a
strip
miner
gets
a
contract
to
operate
the
mine
for
a
year.
the
mine
has
a
30-year
exhaustion.
do
the
strip
miner
get
a
depletion
allowance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
make
it
six
months.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
have
been
a
little
more
generous
in
that
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
termination
clause
here
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
your
question.
parsons,
is
that
in
the
record,
(inaudible)
under
those
determination
if
(inaudible)
has
the
right
to
operate
the
coal,
he
have
troubles
himself
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
he
worked
that
strip
to
exhaustion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
whatever
it
was
(inaudible)
stripped
and
laid
out
that
he
uncovered
the
overburden
on
this
courtroom,
he
operate
the
coal
underneath
that
presumption.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
is
that
different
from
a
situation
where
the
man
has
the
right
to
strip
the
mine
out
of
the
cancellation
clause,
in
respect
with
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
in
the
case
of
this
kind
of
cancellation
clause.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
that
this
has
to
be
regarded
as
an
individual
contract.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
strip
miners
protect
themselves
against
cancellation,
but
to
strip
the
surface
at
the
entire
time
and
he'd
be
able
not
to
stand
in
process,
the
cancellation
clause
operate
for
a
long
time,
the
exhaustion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
hasn't
the
furnishing
of
that
right
obligate
a
mine,
(inaudible)
or
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
another
way.
how
many
--
how
many
courts
of
appeals
cases
are
there
that
have
a
--
have
upheld
the
right
to
depletion
in
a
situation
where
there's
been
no
right
of
termination
on
the
part
of
the
owner
of
the
strip
mine
whether
he
was
entitled?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
there
been
any
differences
of
view
among
them
on
--
in
that
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
--
what
would
you
--
when
i
asked
you
the
question
first,
you
said
that
you
thought
that
the
taxpayer
would
have
an
easier
case
or
a
more
arguable
case,
but
you
shied
away
from
saying
that
he
had
a
case
that
you'd
have
to
agree
with.
now,
why
is
it
that
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
government
would
say,
non-const
there
is
no
economic
interest?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
he's
disposing
of
it
but
he's
disposing
of
it
to
the
owner
at
a
fixed
price,
disposing
of
it,
that's
where
his
income
comes
from.
what
difference
does
it
make
to
whom
it's
disposed
to
as
far
as
economic
interest
is
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
as
to
why
that
deprives
him
that
economic
interest.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
be
clearer
(voice
overlap)
--
it
would
be
clearer
but
i
thought
you
were
in
agreement
with
the
taxpayers
here
at
least
to
the
extent
where
economic
interest
is
not
defined
in
terms
of
some
legal
caption
“laborer”
as
mr.
justice
brennan
called
it,
but
you
looked
at
it
from
the
economic
standpoint
rather
than
the
legal
standpoint,
if
you
choose
to
call
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
are
no
other
facts,
how
would
you
deal
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
right
to
depletion.
you
do
know
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
--
can
i
put
this
question
to
you
that
in
the
case
of
a
termination
lease
where
the
right
to
work,
the
strip
to
exhaustion
is
the
only
fact
in
the
case,
what
difference
is
there
between
that
case
and
as
far
as
that
strip
is
concerned,
and
the
case
that
you
just
agreed
with
me
now
would
entitle
the
taxpayer
to
a
right
to
depletion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
would
agree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
i
understand
your
answer
to
chief
justice.
your
answer
to
my
difficulty
is
that
you've
got
to
look
at
this
contract
as
a
whole
rather
than
in
the
particular
segments
where
the
right
to
terminate
might
not
affect
the
right
to
work
that
particular
mine
to
exhaustion.
is
that
--
is
that
what
i
understand
you
to
say?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
mr.
berger,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?did
your
--
assuming
your
contract
had
a
termination
clause
in
it
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
did
you
have
the
right
to
work
to
exhaustion
in
the
coal
that
was
uncovered?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
fact,
a
very
different
question
as
to
what
you
did
in
practice
and
what
you
have
in
the
rights
of
business,
as
i
understand
in
respect
to
that
respect,
your
case
is
different
as
in
parsons.
justice
john
m.
harlan
