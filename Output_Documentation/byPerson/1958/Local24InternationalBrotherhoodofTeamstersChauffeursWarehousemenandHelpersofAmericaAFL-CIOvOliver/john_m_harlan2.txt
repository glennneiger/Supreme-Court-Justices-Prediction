there

therefore
those

for

not

mr.
previant,
what
if
preemptions
were
held
here,
what
could
the
labor
board
do
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
depend
would
it
not
on
whether
--
what
the
status
is
--
of
your
client
was
in
fact
that
the
contractors

antitrust
provision

justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
antitrust
provision
--
do
you
think
the
federal
government
could
have
brought
an
antitrust
suit
to
enjoin
this
contract
--
enforcement
of
this
contract
being
restraint
of
trade?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
the
federal
government
couldn't
have
brought
such
a
suit,
it
might
be,
might
it
not,
that
the
state
would
similarly
be
foreclosing,
bring
such
a
suit
in
a
theory
of
preemption
there.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
raised
the
question
is
i
didn't
see
any
discussion
in
either
side
in
these
briefs
to
the
norris-laguardia
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
act,
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
your
opponents
don't
either.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
--
oh,
you
assumed
that
there's
no
--
assume
for
the
moment
that
there's
no
preemption
under
the
labor
act
or
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
where
do
you
come
off
under
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or,
maybe
more
specific.
supposing
you
reached
that
stage
and
one
reaches
the
conclusion
that
an
antitrust
suit
could
not
be
brought
in
the
federal
courts
to
enjoin
this
contract
because
it
runs
afoul
in
the
norris-laguardia
act.
where
does
that
leave
you
in
the
state
courts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
the
view
of
mr.
previant
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
i
got
it,
you
don't
think
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
take
that
position,
i'm
not
sure
but
so
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
want
the
brief.
