justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
i
understand
mr.
previant
that
the
--
what
do
you
call
it?
kind
of
a
lease,
not
the
actual
lease.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
lease?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
underway
for
the
use
of
his
--
this
equipment
as
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
all
of
it
for
this
particular
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
by
whom
the
drivers
of
a
leased
equipment
employed
by
this
respondent
certificated
carriers
of
--
by
oliver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
when
they
leased
a
piece
of
equipment,
the
tractors
or
something,
the
lessor
was
--
by
the
driver,
his
own
employee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
said,
i
think
that
on
occasions
or
did
you
say
more
frequently,
oliver
himself
drove
a
piece
of
equipment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
complaint
addressed
as
a
whole
of
that
seven
pages
or
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
that
this
agreement
is
stated,
that
is
quite
collective
bargaining
agreement
executed
by
the
negotiating
committee
with
the
carriers.
i
think
it's
january
1955
that
it
became
effective
later
upon
gratification
by
the
locals.
but
like
following
that
at
145
was
the
motor
trade
transportation
agreement
between
a.
c.
e.
and
oliver
and
that
fair
state
in
december
of
1954,
is
that
right?
oh,
1953.
december
28,
1953,
it
appears
at
149.
now
is
that
the
law
that
we're
concerned
with
at
least
as
the
a.
c.
e.?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
seems
to
be
the
one
with
interstate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
previant,
does
any
of
the
state
court
determinations
turn
on
the
existence
or
not
of
an
employment
relationship
between
oliver
and
the
respondent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
thinking
for
the
purposes
of
the
advancement
point
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
are
we
going
to
--
do
we
have
an
issue
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
of
oliver,
himself
or
his
employees
are
employees
for
the
purposes
in
that
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
on
the
pleadings,
actually
this
bargaining,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
(inaudible)
negotiated
on
behalf
of
the
fact
that
the
actual
employees
(inaudible)
under
the
unit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
which
you
were
bargaining.
and
that
you
were
insisting
upon
this
provision
to
protect
the
wages,
hours
and
other
conditions
that
you
would
obtained
for
those
who
are
in
the
unit
for
which
you
bargained,
namely,
the
members
of
the
employees
of
the
certificated
carriers.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
insist
that
that
was
the
kind
of
issue
that
would
get
into
controversy
which
is
properly
for
this
position
by
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
they're
not
by
reason
of
the
agreement,
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
reason
of
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
the
case
of
oliver
(inaudible)
he
gets
no
rights
than
any
driver
(inaudible)
there's
a
threat
to
the
wage
structure
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
arguing
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
is
properly
exclusive
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
protected
activity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bringing
out
that,
how
far
would
it
cover?
are
you
suggesting
(inaudible)
will
subcontract
to
--
any
subcontracts
in
ohio
or
unless
the
employee
or
that
firm
should
pay
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
denlinger?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
no
such
contracts
had
existed,
would
there
have
been
any
application
of
the
ohio
antitrust
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is
whether
the
existence
of
those
contracts
is
necessary
to
establish
a
case
under
the
ohio
antitrust
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
think
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
arrangement
had
just
been
at
will
of
some
kind
between
oliver
and
the
sophisticated
carriers,
you
might
nevertheless
have
had
a
lawsuit
under
the
ohio
antitrust
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
existence
of
the
contracts
would
have
been
the
basis
for
the
relief
you
had
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
state
court
without
reference
to
the
state's
antitrust
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
then
that
under
your
ohio
law,
interference
with
the
contract
of
this
kind
entitles
due
to
a
remedy
by
way
of
restraint
and
not
limited
to
damages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
did
this
restraint
run
also
against
the
certificated
carriers
or
just
against
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
these
are
lengthy
opinions
of
the
court
below
and
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
don't
know
that
i
have
done
a
good
a
job
of
studying
it
as
i
should.
do
you
suggest
that
they're
actually
based,
the
lease
you
have
was
based
upon
interference
with
the
contract
independent
of
the
valentine
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
specifically
subdivision
4
of
the
valentine
act
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
has
a
standard
of
figure,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
the
--
do
we
--
does
either
opinion
suggest
that
these
are
alternate
grounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
suggest
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
prior
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
you
said
it
was
hardly
permissible.
i'm
wondering
if
you
find
(inaudible),
this
subject
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
general
--
the
general
subject,
mr.
iden,
i
ought
--
suppose
those
would
require
subject
to
bargaining
namely
whether
or
not
an
employer
with
whom
a
union
is
bargaining
for
its
members
or
the
group
that
represents
shall
or
shall
not
subcontract
the
out
part
of
the
employers
work.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
that
reason
maybe
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
informing
of
the
practice
has
certainly
been
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
difference
--
what's
the
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
wasn't
because
you
agreed.
you
agreed
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
iden,
may
i
just
ask
you
this.
doesn't
this
case
really
come
down
to
this
simple
question?
if
this
case,
a
legitimate
subject
to
collective
bargaining
as
a
protective
right
under
federal
law,
to
what
extent
may
the
state,
through
its
courts,
by
this
valentine
act
or
otherwise
enforce
this
agreement
of
oliver's
in
such
why
as
to
nullify
the
agreement
made
between
you
and
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
it
go
down
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
--
what
about
hill
and
florida?
that
was
a
matter
that
they
couldn't
possibly
have
gotten
before
the
labor
board
and
yet
this
court
held
that
the
basic
federal
policy
to
allow
employees
to
complete
premium
of
choice
of
representatives
so
preempted
that
subject
matter
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
state
of
florida
could
not
require
union
agents
to
register
in
florida.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
pertain
to
the
issue
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
the
result
but
isn't
that
basically
the
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
isn't
it
basically
the
same
issue?
if
this
is
the
proper
subject
to
collective
bargaining
protected
by
federal
law
made
the
state
in
anyways
interfere
with
through
enforcement
of
these
independent
contractors.
mr.
justice
black
said
what
difference
does
it
make,
whether
this
independent
contract
is
all
we
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
problem
is
whether
the
state
may
enforce
that
independent
contract
in
place
of
the
superior
federal
right
to
bargain
collectively
upon
the
matters
covered
by
32.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
actually,
supposed
it's
been
a
breach
of
this
agreement.
where
would
have
been
action
as
against
the
union
on
the
part
of
your
client?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
have
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
have
been
sued
at
all
under
section
3
of
the
labor
act,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
federal
law
would've
applied?
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
sue
him
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
order
to
apply
(inaudible)
with
the
ohio
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
by
the
state
laws?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
iden,
does
it
appear
whether
you're
willing
to
sign
it,
the
32
in
it,
that
your
clients
were
willing
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
restraint
actually
was
against
carrying
out
the
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
contract
was
signed
including
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
against
you're
carrying
it
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
a
picketing
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
i
mean,
those
cases
you've
mentioned,
aren't
they
all
picketing?
