mr.
stanley
denlinger
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i
will
devote
the
time
allotted
your
honors
to
the
position
of
revel
oliver,
the
owner
operator
and
plaintiff
below
in
the
trial
courts
of
ohio.
and
mr.
iden
will
devote
his
time
to
the
position
of
the
carriers,
interstate
and
a.c.e.
and
we
will
try
to
keep
our
arguments
and
positions
as
to
those
respective
parties
are
separate
as
we
can.
throughout
the
briefs
of
the
teamsters
union
and
their
position
in
this
court,
they
have
studiously
and
methodically
ignored
the
keystone
of
foundation
contract
on
which
this
litigation
began.
justice
whittaker
has
saved
me
some
time
in
ascertaining
that
the
contracts
on
which
the
plaintiff
relied
in
the
trial
courts
and
the
contract
which
was
given
interpretation
on
the
question
of
relationship
and
status
was
the
contract
existing
and
in
full
force
and
effect
for
more
than
three
years
prior
to
the
execution
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
known
as
the
“over
the
road
agreement”
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
this
record.
this
contract
between
revel
oliver
and
the
carriers
with
a.c.e.
was
dated
december
28th
1953
as
appears
on
pages
145
and
149
of
the
record.
for
a
period
of
many
years
before
that,
identical
contracts
were
in
existence
varying
only
in
description
and
license
number
of
the
tractor
and
trailer
leased.
oliver's
lease
dated
june
the
20,
1955
for
the
mac
truck
in
ohio
body
trailer
with
interstate,
was
a
replacement
of
equipment
that
he
had
leased
at
this
company's
business
since
1952.
and
so
we
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
contracts
between
oliver
and
the
carriers
where
all
existing
prior
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now
the
a.c.e.
contract
with
oliver
provides
among
other
things
on
page
147
of
the
record
the
relationship
created
is
that
of
independent
contractor
and
not
that
of
employer
and
employee,
the
operator
is
a
contractor
only
and
not
the
employee
of
the
carrier
and
that
is
the
quote
from
that
contract.
secondly,
the
interstate
calls
oliver
the
leasor
and
provides
an
addition
to
the
lease
of
the
equipment
that
oliver
and
i
quote,
“will
also
furnish
one
or
more
competent
drivers
as
maybe
the
case,”
from
page
150
of
the
record.
we
conclude
that
the
independent
contractor
relationship
was
established
by
the
wording
of
these
contracts
themselves
existing
at
the
time
that
the
collective
bargaining
arrangement
was
entered
in
to
between
the
carriers
and
the
union.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
if
no
contracts
are
existed
we
would
not
have
had
this
lawsuit
either
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
in
respect
to
the
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
valentine
act
or
the
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
no,
we
think
not.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
we
think
not.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
we
think
that
any
citizen
or
the
state
might
have
brought
such
an
action,
but
justice
brennan
we
feel
that
the
finding
of
the
court
relative
to
the
invalidity
of
article
32
is
not
necessary
to
the
determination
of
the
case
and
that
the
state
court
neither
the
trial
or
the
appellate
court
relied
wholly
upon
the
valentine
act
to
find
that
the
existing
agreement
should
not
be
interfered
with.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
i
--
i
--
i
say
that
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
i
say
that,
if
your
honor
please,
for
the
reason
that
the
trial
judge
who
i
might
say
off
the
records,
spent
an
entire
summer
in
looking
up
this
question
and
writing
his
opinion
after
careful
study
found
in
his
opinion,
it
was
not
absolutely
necessary
to
determine
either
the
question
of
independent
contractor
of
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
ohio
because
oliver
was
being
damaged
by
an
interference
with
his
existing
contract.
now
that
is
the
basis
of
our
claim
and
the
angle
of
the
voidness
or
illegality
of
article
32
is
something
on
which
the
carriers
themselves
i
think
rely
more
than
we
as
an
owner-operator
felt
was
necessary
to
establish
the
remedy
which
the
courts
of
ohio
purported.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
it
ran
against
both
the
certificated
carriers,
apparently
the
union
and
that
was
based
on
two
reasons,
that
article
32
itself
required
a
modification,
cancellation,
or
obliteration
of
the
existing
agreements
within
30
days
after
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
went
into
effect.
in
addition
to
that,
these
characters
particularly
notifying
mr.
oliver
and
all
other
owner-operators
at
a.c.e
and
interstate
that
they
were
advised
that
the
leases
would
have
to
be
canceled
because
of
the
agreement.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
certainly.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
oh,
i
think
the
courts
tied
the
two
together.
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
because
in
each
instance,
the
courts
found
that
this
article
32
was
on
its
face,
a
tendency
to
create
a
monopoly
under
the
valentine
act
of
ohio
by
establishing
rates
which
all
owner-operators
had
to
charge
throughout
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
i
don't
think
it
shows
any
alternate
grounds
at
all,
your
honor,
i
think
they're
tied
together
as
i
understand
it
from
reading
the
opinions
and
findings
of
both
courts.
now,
if
i
can
go
back
to
the
point
of
discussion
of
independent
contractors
neither
the
trial
court
nor
the
appellate
court
trying
this
case
de
novo.
and
i
say
that
your
honors
because
this
matter
was
not
carelessly
litigated
in
either
courts
but
quite
fully
and
carefully
and
the
teamsters
brought
new
testimony
into
the
appellate
court
by
way
of
mr.
james
hopper
of
detroit
testifying
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
from
the
evidence
and
not
standing
alone
on
the
name
or
designation
given
to
the
relationship
in
the
contracts
of
the
carriers
and
the
owner-operator,
the
court
found
that
oliver
purchased
his
equipment
in
his
own
name,
this
was
of
his
own
choice,
make,
type,
and
horsepower.
that
he
paid
the
drivers
the
union
scale,
that
he
withheld
the
withholding
tax
and
accounted
to
his
--
the
revenue
department
for
it.
he
paid
the
social
security
and
unemployment
benefits
under
the
federal
and
state
firms.oliver
alone
discharged
or
fired
employees,
the
carriers
never
did.
and
oliver
pays
the
ohio
drivers
insurance.
he
pays
for
the
fuel
permits
for
all
oil,
gas,
tires,
and
repair,
collision,
fire,
and
prep
insurance.
he
pays
his
driver's
health
and
welfare
benefits.
he
pays
all
the
bridge
tolls.
he
takes
his
equipment
to
service
station
of
his
own
choice
for
service.
his
trucks
are
dispatched
at
the
terminals
of
the
company
on
the
basis
of
first
in,
first
out
along
with
company
equipment.
his
drivers
comply
with
all
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
icc
and
oliver
pays
for
all
fines
or
charges
or
any
violation
of
any
kind.
the
trial
court
had
complete
authority
to
determine
the
status
and
relationship
of
the
parties
under
the
lease
contract
without
going
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
anyways,
shape,
or
form.
and,
this
was
a
contract
entered
into
or
wholly
beyond
the
authority,
jurisdiction,
or
direction,
or
enforcement
of
any
kind
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
it
was
a
contract
dealing
not
with
wages,
hours
or
working
conditions
of
employees.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
we
think
not
your
honor
because
this
was
not
a
labor
dispute.
we
do
not
think
that
an
attempt
upon
any
third
party
combining
with
a
contracting
party
to
breach
an
existing
agreement
presents
a
problem
of
labor
dispute.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
no.
i
can't
accept
that
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
as
the
trial
court
said,
whether
mr.
oliver
was
an
independent
contractor
or
whether
he
was
some
other
name
you
might
assign
to
him.
he
had
a
contract,
perfectly
bona
fide
regarding
the
leasing
of
equipment
and
driver
and
so
forth
and
no
one,
union,
anybody.
it
--
it
didn't
have
to
be
a
union
who
brought
about
a
breach
of
this
contract.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
labor
and
strife
and
the
prevention
of
stoppages
of
work
and
so
on
is
no
feature
of
a
contract
of
this
nature
between
a
carrier
and
an
individual
or
between
anyone
in
industry.
that
is
our
position,
i
think
largely
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
was
that
of
a
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
think
that
it
might
have.
but
i
--
i
do
not
think
that,
that
was
the
remedy
afforded
to
a
citizen
of
ohio
entering
into
a
contract
between
citizens
of
the
same
state
and
involving
subject
matter
to
be
enforced
into
the
state.
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
might
have
instituted
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
federal
wise
was
a
remedy
which
preempted
the
hearing
of
the
matter
in
federal
court
as
distinguished
from
the
right
of
the
state
of
ohio
to
pass
upon
the
question
just
before
it.
that
is
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
in
--
if
i
may
say
this
your
honor,
on
the
valentine
act
of
ohio.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
it
may
be
enforced
by
individuals
and
with
the
damage
arising
in
connection
with
it
as
distinguished
from
enforcement
solely
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
state.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
that
is
possible
under
the
act.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
to
discuss
that
until
your
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
honor
has
presented
the
question
now
to
me
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
but
i
feel
that
--
that
in
the
light
of
your
decisions
lately
in
gonzales
and
russell
that
the
fact
that
even
though
there
might
have
been
a
remedy
from
a
federal
wise
action
to
be
taken
that
unless
that
remedy
gave
all
of
the
relief
which
our
state
court
might
have
given
oliver
in
this
case
that
it
would
present
no
question
of
preemption
to
the
federal
courts,
to
the
ouster
of
the
courts
of
ohio.
that's
our
position
on
that,
but
it
doesn't
answer
your
honors
question,
but
it's
the
best
answer
i
have.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
certainly.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
that
is
not
my
point
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
i
said
there
was
no
labor
dispute
as
we
understood
our
transaction,
but
that
--
if
the
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
take
application
here
and
the
court
or
the
government
sought
to
find
the
carriers
and
the
union
in
violation
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act,
that
all
of
the
procedures
furnished
either
by
the
sherman
antitrust
act
or
by
the
application
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
to
federal
labor
disputes
would
not
here
furnish
a
basis
of
ouster
of
our
state
courts
and
the
preemption
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
for
the
reason
that
the
remedy
under
either
the
norris-laguardia
act
or
the
sherman
antitrust
would
not
furnish
the
remedy
to
which
we
are
entitled
under
a
set
of
facts
of
the
nature
here
presented.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes.
but
there
your
problem
was
not
an
existing
agreement
between
the
--
one
of
the
party's
defendant
and
the
plaintiff
your
honor.
we
do
not
think
that
applies
to
our
set
of
facts
here
at
all.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
oh,
yes.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
well,
i
--
i
don't
understand
that
the
problem
of
contract
is
presented
here
is
in
the
case
your
honor
cited
at
all.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
but
the
parties
were
different.
there
you
--
you'll
have
in
effect
what
would
be
the
carriers
here
in
that
position.
you
do
not
have
the
owner-operator
as
the
party
plaintiff
seeking
the
relief,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
that
was
a
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
and
the
employer
was
making
the
claim
that
it
was
not
a
labor
dispute
because
it
involved
independent
contract.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
yes.
i
think
it
makes
a
great
difference
whether
the
man
who
has
a
contract,
that
whose
--
which
breach
is
sought
and
complete
it
by
third
parties
or
whether
it
is
the
employer
and
the
union
if
your
honor
please,
who
raises
the
question?
i
think
the
rights
of
parties
are
very
distinguishable
there.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
well,
that
is
one
of
the
findings
the
court
has
made
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
the
--
but
first
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
we
say
that
he
--
that
he
cannot
enter
into
such
an
agreement
as
is
provided
in
article
32,
your
honor.
we
--
we
say
to
your
honor
that
the
destruction
of
an
existing
contract
terminated
by
the
terms
of
an
agreement
of
third
parties
is
not
a
negotiable
subject
for
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
say
that
a
clause
in
a
collective
bargaining
contract
that
requires
an
owner-operator
are
independent
contractor
to
vary
the
terms
and
conditions
of
his
existing
agreement
at
the
peril
of
having
his
contract
cancelled
is
not
a
negotiable
subject
for
unions
and
management.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
no,
i
don't
say
that's
not
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
if
they
negotiated
such
an
agreement,
it
would
then
be
subject
to
the
objections
of
the
contracting
parties
who
would
be
affected
by
such
a
change
of
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
configuration
to
which
they
were
not
a
party.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
we
think
so,
definitely.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
well,
may
i
answer
your
honor
this
way.
we
have
not
attacked
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
we
have
attacked
one
clause
that
is
separate
and
distinct,
completely
dealing
with
a
specific
classification
that
on
its
faces
thereby
admitted
by
the
terms
of
the
agreement
is
not
a
part
of
wages,
hours,
or
condition
of
employment
of
employee.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
if
your
honor
please,
our
court
said
not
sought
to
punish
anyone.
our
courts
have
taken
the
position
that
such
a
contract
interferes
with
a
valid
agreement
existing
in
the
state
and
therefore
we
will
protect
the
existing
contract
against
the
onslaught.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
if
your
honor
please,
i'll
have
to
answer
that
question
by
saying,
“i
don't
know
how
this
question
could
have
gotten
to
the
labor
board.”
i
see
no
way
that
we
could
have
had
a
determination
of
the
fact
on
which
your
honor
bases
the
question
on
what
our
courts
of
ohio
might
do.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
no,
i
would
not
go
that
far
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
in
other
words,
we
have
meticulously
tried
since
your
decision
on
the
(inaudible)
case
in
ohio
to
follow
the
admonitions
that
you
have
on
preemption
on
jurisdiction
and
i
am
guessing
of
course,
but
i
do
not
think
that
our
courts
of
ohio
would
run
crosswise
to
a
declaration
of
this
court
or
of
the
board
as
to
a
contract
that
we
might
otherwise
feel
interfere
with
our
operations
in
ohio.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
if
your
honor
please,
we
think
that
that
problem
was
not
presented
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
we
are
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
--
attempting
to
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
no.
we
think
that
is
not
the
heart
of
it.
we
think
the
heart
of
this
case
is,
may
the
union
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
carrier
who
already
has
an
existing
contract
with
which
requires
by
its
very
terms
a
complete
elimination
or
modification
of
an
existing
bona
fide
enforceable
contract
that
would
result
in
the
complete
elimination
of
that
legal
agreement.
we
think
that
that
is
our
plaintiff's
case
here.
now
this
--
this
arrangement
of
leasing,
if
your
honor
please,
is
just
as
common
a
business
as
this
so-called
collective
bargaining
of
the
teamsters
over
the
various
states.
and
this
very
court
in
the
mc-43
case
held
that
it's
perfectly
proper
for
a
carrier
to
operate
on
the
basis
of
owning
his
own
equipment
or
leasing
equipment.
and
there,
the
majority
of
this
court
found
that
the
regulation
of
the
icc
with
reference
to
trip
leases
was
the
perfectly
validly
regulation
which
the
commission
was
authorized
to
make
and
which
this
court
would
approve.
two
of
the
members
of
this
court
took
the
position
that
even
that
interfered
with
the
legal
right
of
the
carrier
to
choose,
whether
or
not
he
should
use
leased
or
company-owned
equipment.
now,
in
that
very
case,
this
court
approved
the
leasing
of
equipment
in
accordance
with
icc
regulations.
and
if
there
is
any
question
here
on
the
part
of
the
union
as
to
inroads
into
wages
or
other
conditions
because
of
the
lack
of
proper
regulation
with
the
icc,
then
the
task
lies
not
in
making
contracts
which
compel
the
elimination
of
existing
agreements,
but
lies
in
the
teamsters'
approach
to
the
icc
for
such
a
regulation
as
will
correct
the
evils
that
they
may
charge
is
being
perpetrated.
now,
we
--
mr.
stanley
denlinger
sir?
mr.
stanley
denlinger
all
right.
now
if
your
honors
please,
unless
you
have
some
questions
i
will
stop
with
that
and
not
bear
upon
the
time
of
mr.
iden
who
desires
to
present
the
carriers'
position.
if
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
shall
honestly
attempt
to
answer
them
before
your
honors.
mr.
stanley
denlinger
thank
you,
sir.
