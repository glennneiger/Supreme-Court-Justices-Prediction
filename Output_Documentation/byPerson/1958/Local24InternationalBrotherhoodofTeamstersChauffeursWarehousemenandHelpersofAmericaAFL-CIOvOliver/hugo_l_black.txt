that

justice

l.

your
--
your
argument
is
based
on
the
act
of
preemption,
is
all
you
are
arguing.
justice

black
preemption,
what
do
you
claim
as
preempted?
what
could
the
board
do?
justice

suppose
he
did
something.
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
whole
that
this
contract
is
a
kind
that's
not
protected
by
the
act,
what
would
be
the
result
then?
should
it
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
it
did?
justice
hugo

black
then
what
you
are
saying
is
as
i
understand
it,
the
sum
total
of
what
you're
saying
and
the
consequence
of
what
you're
saying
would
be
that
the
board
has
the
right
to
pass
on
this
rather
than
the
state
of
ohio
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
first
inference,
at
least.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
anything
unique
in
the
holding,
if
there
should
be
a
holding
that
in
the
labor
appeal
that
a
man
specified
as
an
independent
contractor
by
state
law
is
an
employee
under
this
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
merely
about
drivers
but
is
there
anything
unique
in
holding
in
other
types
of
activity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we
have
some
cases
on
that
a
number
of
times.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
be
true
that
--
there
has
to
be
a
review
of
a
--
of
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
man
is
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor,
should
we
decide
that
before
the
board
act
upon
it?
justice

black
uelmen,
you
may
proceed
with
the
case
which
you
have
before
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
denlinger.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
following
up
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
question
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
--
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
ground
on
which
you
say
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
no
relationship
to
it.
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
because
this
was
not
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
what
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
latter
argument
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
first
one.
but
if
you
are
saying
it
is
not
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
i'd
like
you
to
explain
why
it
was
not
under
our
opinion
which
i
had
thought
i
wrote.
i
had
thought
you
said
that
negotiating
over
with
independent,
whatever
you
call
them,
buys
--
buy
their
own
goods
and
have
their
own
wagon.
i
thought
we
he
had
said
that
was
a
labor
dispute
in
the
drivers'
union
against
lake
valley
company,
311,
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
there's
any
difference
in
the
type
of
contracts
that
were
made
there
and
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
what
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
argument
was
that
it
couldn't
be
a
labor
dispute
because
these
were
vendors
of
milk,
they
bought
milk.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wasn't
--
what
was
held
there
was
that
that
was
a
labor
dispute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
involved
that
system
of
doing
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
who
raises
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
labor
dispute?
in
negotiation
was
in
connection
with
the
system
that
was
conducted.
connection
with
the
wages
and
said
that
these
independent
vendors
were
breaking
down
the
wage
scale.
therefore,
they
negotiated
in
connection
with
that
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can't
understand
how
there'd
be
a
--
if
your
court
had
found
that
there
was
--
what's
generally
termed
the
tort
of
malicious
interference
of
contract
rights.
if
they
had
based
their
ruling
on
that,
you
would
have
a
different
argument
here,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
not
an
independent
basis
for
this.and
even
if
it
were,
you
would
have
other
questions
that
come
up.
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
they
cannot
negotiate
on
this
with
the
different
employers
there
and
this
man
who
drove
the
truck
part
of
the
time
and
hired
others
to
drive
it
part
of
the
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
i
suppose
that
the
driver
did
all
his
driving
in
spite
the
equipment,
every
bit
of
it.
and
many
of
them
did.
and
the
union
went
to
the
employers
and
said,
“now,
this
system
is
destroying
our
wage
scale
and
our
working
hours
scale,
we
want
to
negotiate.
we
don't
want
you
to
do
business
with
them.”
would
you
say
that
was
not
a
labor
dispute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
say
that
the
--
that
wouldn't
come
within
the
range
of
things
about
which
they
could
negotiate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
are
many
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
many
regulatory
laws
that
do
not
--
that
involve
contracts
either
directly
or
incidentally.
and
suppose
that
--
suppose
you
assumed
for
the
moment,
that
this
is
a
proper
subject
to
negotiation
between
a
labor
union
composed
of
drivers
and
composed
of
companies
who
drive
--
who
employ
them.
supposed
it's
a
proper
subject
to
negotiation
for
them
to
say,
to
make
a
contract,
to
try
to
make
a
contract
to
the
effect
that
they've
got
to
amend
in
that
system
entirely
or
else
they've
got
to
pay
a
certain
amounts.
would
that
be
an
improper
question
to
negotiate
under
the
taft-hartley
act
or
the
other
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
would
definitely
could
not
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
who
do
you
think
should
pass
on
that?
who
should
have
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
that's
within
the
range
of
things
that
are
permissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
collect
--
you
have
attacked
one
term
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
supposed
it
were,
suppose
congress
had
made
it
such,
would
you
say
that
ohio
could
make
--
could
punish
a
man
or
a
company
or
a
union
or
anybody
else
for
entering
into
an
agreement
or
negotiating
over
an
agreement
that
congress
had
permitted
to
be
negotiated
in
connection
with
interstate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
supposed
--
suppose
it
would
be
decided.
suppose
the
labor
board
had
decided
and
the
courts
had
sustained
the
decision
that
this
is
a
proper
subject
of
negotiation
under
the
circumstances
here.
would
you
still
say
that
ohio
could
make
it
an
illegal
part
of
a
contract
and
nullify
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
different
argument
that
you're
making
now.
suppose
it
had
gotten
before
the
labor
board
and
it
decided
it
and
the
court
sustained
it.
would
you
say
that
still
that
ohio
could
nullify
the
contract
on
the
ground
that
they
shouldn't
have
negotiated
it
even
though
the
federal
government
permitted
it
in
connection
with
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
this
question
frankly
because
i
don't
know,
but
i'm
wondering.
i
had
supposed
that
this
was
a
very
common
type
of
contract
and
the
people
negotiated
quite
all
the
time.
i
haven't
written
or
given
also
which
is
quite
a
different
case
but
i
had
suppose
it
were
rather
come
as
--
say
at
least
since
the
milk
wagon
drivers'
case
that
there
were
negotiations
about
people,
where
they
call
them
independent
contractors
or
anything
else
but
it
was
interfering
with
the
wage
system
claimed
to
be
that
the
parties
would
negotiate
that.
and
sometimes
it
might
result
in
saying
if
these
contracts
--
where
you're
not
going
to
make
these
contracts,
not
going
to
--
you
--
you're
not
--
we'll
negotiate
with
you
on
whether
you
will
bar
this
kind
of
--
or
whether
you
can
do
business
this
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
the
--
the
heart
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
denlinger.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
iden.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
any
challenge
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
insofar
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
it's
valid,
it's
binding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
this
subject?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
that
make
on
the
issue
here
whether
you
call
him
an
independent
contract
or
something
else?
if
there's
a
power
to
negotiate
to
do
this,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
calls
himself
an
independent
contractor
or
just
a
contractor
or
something
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
problem
--
isn't
the
problem
whether
they
have
a
right
to
negotiate
over
that
and
enter
the
contract.
and
may
i
ask
you
this,
i
don't
--
maybe
you're
right.
can
it
be
true
that
you
can
assume
that
it's
unlawful
to
enter
into
a
contract
and
yet
that
the
labor
board
or
the
other
board
has
the
power
to
force
you
to
negotiate
it
over
it
in
the
other
end
of
a
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
but
in
determining
whether
it's
a
negotiable
thing
and
whether
they
should
enter
into
it,
is
the
board
barred
from
saying,
“we'll,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
negotiate
over
this
because
that's
a
plain
violation
of
the
law.
suppose
there's
a
--
negotiating
on
whether
seven
people
should
be
assaulted."
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it.
it
doesn't
have
antitrust
jurisdiction
but
does
it
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
or
not

is
a
legitimate
subject

--
on

legitimate
subject
of

justice

black
is
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
combination
of
a
union
with
competing
companies?
justice

black
i'm
not
talking
about
so
far
as
your
client
is
concerned.
that

that

where

did
you

what

what
did
your

have
to
do
with
it?
did
he
sign

how
much

you
