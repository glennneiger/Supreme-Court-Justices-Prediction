mr.
david
previant
the
court
please.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right
your
honor.
thank
you.
this
is
quite
another
antitrust
case,
equity
case,
in
quite
a
different
posture.
it
is
here
under
the
--
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
judicial
district
of
ohio,
presents
the
question
of
whether
a
state
has
the
jurisdiction
to
declare
illegal
under
a
state
antitrust
act,
a
provision
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
between
a
union
and
employers
who
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
it
is,
in
short,
a
preemption
case.
the
petitioners
are
a
local
labor
union
and
its
officers
who
have
their
office
in
ohio
and
whose
membership
is
domicile
and
principally
in
ohio.
the
respondent's
transportation
companies
are
common
carriers.
they
are
certificated,
both
by
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
are
downside
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
they
make
deliveries
in
many
states
outside
of
that
state.
and
the
court
below,
they
were
defendants.
here,
they
are
respondents
since
they
have
taken
any
position
which
is
the
same
as
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
court
below,
the
respondent,
revel
oliver,
who
also
is
a
resident
of
ohio.
he
is
a
member
of
the
petitioner
union.
he
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
leasing
trucking
equipment
to
the
respondent
carrier.
i
say,
he
leases
trucking
equipment.
he
himself
is
not
in
the
transportation
business.
he
occasionally
drives
his
own
truck
in
the
service
of
the
carrier.
the
contract
which
is
involved
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
many
unions,
many
carriers,
many
employer
associations
in
the
midwest
area.
it
is
known
as
the
“central
states
over-the-road
motor
freight
agreement,”
and
it
covers
principally
what
is
known
as
“over-the-road
or
inter-city
trucking.”
there
are
some
3500
employers
who
are
parties
to
this
agreement.
they
were
at
the
time
that
the
litigation
started
some
45,000
to
50,000
truck
drivers
who
were
covered
by
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
in
ohio,
there
are
some
500
employers
who
are
parties
to
the
agreement,
some
6000
drivers
at
the
start
of
this
litigation
who
are
also
covered
by
the
agreement.
from
5
to
10%
of
those
drivers
own
their
own
equipment
and
leased
that
equipment
and
drive
it
in
the
service
of
a
certificated
carrier.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
well,
they
were
a
series
of
contracts.
i
believe
the
particular
contract
was
negotiated
after
those
leases.
there
were
other
similar
contracts
which
were
negotiated
before
the
leases.
there
had
been
earlier
litigation
in
this
matter.
this
is
the
latest
of
that
litigation.
mr.
oliver
had
prior
to
this
instant
litigation
started,
other
litigation
involving
the
predecessor
contract.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
can't
tell
you
that
directly
because
i
know
that
there
were
a
series
of
contracts
and
we
have
never
been
able
to
enforce
this
particular
contract
with
respect
to
the
respondent
oliver
or
with
respect
to
the
respondent
carrier
because
of
ex
parte
restraining
orders
which
had
been
entered
against
such
enforcement
which
i
think
puts
those
leases,
those
individual
contracts
in
a
different
situation
than
they
would
ordinarily
be.
the
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
there
are
leases.
mr.
david
previant
there
are
--
yes
the
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
the
respondent
oliver
owns,
i
think,
six
tractors
and
four
trailers.
he
leases
these
equipments
to
carriers
who
are
certificated
and
are
permitted
to
engage
in
a
transportation
business.
mr.
david
previant
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
i
think
the
two
respondent
carriers
were
under
lease
arrangements
with
the
respondent
oliver.
he
is
not
necessarily
limited.
he
can
enter
into
that
kind
of
a
lease
arrangement
with
any
certificated
carrier.
he
needs
no
certificate
to
do
so.
mr.
david
previant
that's
--
that's
the
depth
of
our
argument,
your
honor.
the
drivers
in
this
case
were
employed
by
revel
oliver
contrary
to
and
in
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
the
carriers
had
entered
into
with
the
union.
but
the
enforcement
of
which
both
the
carriers
and
the
union
had
been
restrained
from.
that
gave
rise
to
this
litigation.
mr.
david
previant
in
this
particular
case,
that's
right.
and
as
we
shall
show,
that
is
not
a
common
practice.
mr.
david
previant
very
rare
occasions.
on
very
rare
occasions
according
to
this
record,
he
would
drive
himself
a
piece
of
equipment
in
the
service
of
one
of
these
respondent
carriers.
the
--
i
think
it
is
also
pertinent
to
note
because
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
case
that
the
identical
contract
provision
is
found
also
in
a
multiemployer,
multistate
contract,
covering
some
10
southern
states.
it
is
also
found
in
a
multiemployer,
multistate
contract
covering
the
new
england
states.
it
is
also
found
in
a
multiemployer
unit
in
new
york
and
pennsylvania,
and
virginia.
and
i
think
the
significance,
of
course,
will
demonstrate
itself
as
the
points
that
are
involved
--
are
developed
here.
it
is
only
one
article
of
this
particular
contract
which
is
involved.
incidentally
the
contract
has
been
bodily
placed
into
the
record
at
page
144.
the
court
will
note
that
it
is
approximately
100
pages
long
and
at
the
particular
contract
provision
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
is
approximately
7
pages
long.
now,
the
one
article
that
is
involved
--
mr.
david
previant
that
is
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
in
order
to
avoid
confusion
of
--
i
will
refer
to
a
lease
when
i
refer
to
the
arrangement
between
the
lessor
and
the
carriers,
and
i'll
refer
to
the
contract
when
i'm
referring
to
this
collective
bargaining
contract
or
labor
contract.
the
article
32
which
is
here
involved
deals
principally
with
this
relationship
between
the
employers
and
what
is
known
in
this
industry
as
an
owner-operator.
it
is
sometimes
referred
to
with
the
contract
also
as
an
owner-driver.
in
other
industries,
he
may
be
called
a
vendor
or
peddler.
he
may
be
called
a
gypsy
but
it's
essentially
a
man
who
owns
his
own
piece
of
trucking
equipment
and
drives
it
himself.
and
this
article
32,
as
i
say,
deals
principally
with
that
kind
of
employee.
and
in
that
regard,
as
i've
said,
the
respondent
revel
oliver
is
not
typical
because
he
owns
more
than
one
piece
of
equipment
and
he
himself
drives
infrequently.
the
owner-operator
incidentally
has
no
certificates
and
no
licenses.
he
cannot
engage
in
the
transportation
business
as
such.
the
only
way
he
can
use
his
vehicle
in
common
carriage
is
by
associating
himself
by
lease
with
a
certificated
carrier.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
this
court
has
--
has
had
before
a
litigation
involving
the
kinds
of
leases
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
thinks
it
ought
to
have.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that's
right.
and
that
again
is
one
of
our
problems
here.
well
anyway,
in
this
particular
instance,
revel
oliver
brought
this
action
to
restrain
the
labor
unions
and
the
employers
from
enforcing
this
particular
provision,
article
32
of
the
labor
union
agreement.
it
was
his
complaint
that
this
agreement
restrained
competition
in
the
leasing
of
motor
vehicle
equipment
to
certificated
carriers.
mr.
david
previant
and
is
--
excuse
me.
mr.
david
previant
no.
this
complaint
was
addressed
to
all
of
article
32
and
it
is
all
of
article
32
which
the
court
adjudicated.
mr.
david
previant
surely.
mr.
david
previant
that
is
one
of
them.
now,
you
will
notice
that
there's
a
whole
series
of
them
your
honor.
there's
one
following
that,
that
is
dated
june
20th,
1955.
mr.
david
previant
interstate.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
there
are
others,
well
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
they
do
and
the
record
shows
that
was
a
series
of
renewals
or
substitutions
as
equipment
may
have
been
change
or
transferred
or
purchased.
that's
right.
the
--
and
part
of
the
complaint
was
that
this
particular
provision
of
the
labor
of
contract
was
a
price
fixing
device
in
violation
of
the
ohio
antitrust
act.
that
case
was
tried
before
a
court
of
original
jurisdiction
which
found
against
the
union
over
the
union's
contention
that
it
neither
violated
the
ohio
act
and
the
principal
contention
that
the
lower
courts
had
--
the
ohio
court
had
no
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
because
it
was
a
matter
which
is
covered
solely
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
on
appeal
to
the
intermediate
appellate
court
in
ohio,
the
determination
of
the
trial
court
was
affirmed
and
that
court
made
these
findings
and
they're
set
forth
in
the
record
at
pages
256
to
257
and
summarized
in
our
brief
at
page
23.
prior
to
that,
mr.
oliver
was
an
independent
contractor
in
his
relationship
to
the
certificated
carrier,
that
this
particular
provision
of
the
contract,
article
32,
was
not
protected
by
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
article
32
had
violated
the
ohio
antitrust
act.
that
mr.
oliver
would
be
damage
and
injured
if
it
were
enforced
as
against
him.
that
he
has
no
remedy
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction.
and
therefore
a
restraint
was
entered
which
restraints
the
--
both
the
carriers
and
the
union
from
interfering
with
any
of
revel
oliver's
leasing
arrangements,
from
interfering
with
the
rates
which
might
be
charged
for
the
equipment
which
is
leased
and
from
enforcing
article
32,
to
fixed
rates
in
any
manner.
upon
appeal
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
debatable
constitutional
question
we're
here
now.
the
general
background
of
article
32,
i
think,
is
familiar
to
this
court
because
of
matters
that
had
been
before
the
court
involving
the
same
kind
of
a
provision.
it
has
been
in
the
--
in
this
uniform
multistate,
multiemployer
agreement
from
the
inception
of
multistate
negotiations
in
1938.
it
has
been
amended
and
modified
from
time
to
time
to
meet
the
changing
of
circumstances,
but
essentially,
it
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
unions
together
with
the
employers
sometimes
willingly
and
sometimes
reluctantly
to
meet
and
attempt
to
cure
the
various
evils
which
were
attended
upon
in
owner-operator
kind
of
an
operation.
mr.
david
previant
there
was
a
determination
in
the
lower
court
who
thought
it
was
immaterial
to
the
case
that
revel
oliver
was
an
independent
contractor.
the
appellate
court
indicated
the
same
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
they
were
talking
about
him
as
an
independent
contractor
in
the
leasing
of
vehicles
plus
drivers
or
whether
he
was
--
they
were
talking
of
him
as
an
independent
contractor
when
he
himself
drove
the
vehicle
in
the
service
of
one
of
these
certificated
carriers.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
the
issue
this
court
has
to
determine
is
that
if
there's
a
debatable
question
that
should
have
been
determined
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
not
by
the
ohio
court.
mr.
david
previant
the
earlier
cases
in
this
court
involving
the
milk
wagon
drivers
and
the
bakery
sales
drivers
delineates
fairly
well,
the
kind
of
economic
problem
that
has
been
created
by
the
so-called
owner-operator
or
vendor
system.
and
this
court
that
far
back
said
that
the
realities
of
industrial
such
strike
require
that
the
court
take
cognizance
of
the
problem
of
competition
for
wages
that
is
created
with
the
owner-operator
method
of
distribution
as
distinguished
from
an
employee-driver
distribution.
similarly,
when
the
american
trucking
association
case
was
before
this
court,
this
court
took
judicial
knowledge
and
accepted
i
should
say
the
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
its
regulation
known
as
mc-43.
that
the
owner-operator
created
a
very
serious
safety
problem
in
this
industry
and
this
court
affirmed
the
right
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
meet
that
problem
by
promulgating
regulations
with
respect
to
what
shall
be
the
contents
of
those
leases
and
what
shall
be
the
method
of
compensation
under
those
leases
and
what
shall
be
the
requirements
for
examination
and
inspection
in
interchange
of
equipment
if
those
owner-operators
or
any
person
leasing
vehicles
were
to
lease
them
to
a
certificated
carrier.
article
32
generally
ensures
the
employee
status
of
the
owner-driver
and
i
will
break
it
down
a
little
bit
more
in
detail.
but
just
to
get
a
general
picture,
it
assures
the
payment
of
union
wages
and
the
enjoyment
of
union
conditions,
the
protection
of
seniority,
it
requires
payment
of
social
security
upon
these
owner-drivers,
workmen's
compensation,
unemployment
compensation.
they
must
get
their
health
and
welfare
benefits,
their
pension
benefits,
their
vacations,
their
seniority
just
as
any
other
driver
under
the
particular
provision
which
is
now
before
the
court.
the
inquiry
of
course,
now
it
is
whether
or
not
the
specific
provisions
of
this
article
directed
to
this
purposes
come
within
the
matrix
of
collective
bargaining
which
is
protected,
fostered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
whether
a
state
may
say,
“we
have
an
antitrust
act
here,
we
find
this
thing
to
be
in
violation
of
antitrust
act
regardless
of
his
repercussions
with
respect
to
collective
bargaining
in
this
multiemployer,
multistate
area,
regardless
of
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
we
have
come
to.
whether
release
rates
provided
for
in
this
agreement
there
are
reasonable
relationship
to
the
protection
of
wages,
whether
or
not
the
subcontracting
clause,
there
is
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
purposes
for
which
labor
unions
are
formed
that
we
can
ignore
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
we
can
assert
the
illegality
of
this
particular
contract
clause
because
for
suits
that
violates
the
antitrust
act
of
the
state
of
ohio
regardless
of
whether
it
maybe
legal
or
illegal
in
any
other
state
or
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.”
it
is
of
course
our
position
that
it
clearly
falls
within
the
area
of
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
contemplated
by
the
congress,
whether
adopted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
david
previant
i
refer
to
article
32
and
i
should
like
to
break
down
article
32
and
its
essential
provisions
so
that
you
may
understand
why
we
take
the
position
we
do
that
this
is
so
closely
related.
mr.
david
previant
surely.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
think
that
if
you
will
permit
me
to
rephrase
the
question.
the
union
does
have
a
right
to
negotiate
with
respect
to
employees
of
that
employer.
if
in
that
negation,
it
should
say,
there
shall
be
no
subcontracting,
it
has
got
to
affect
a
transportation
contract
with
someone
else
because
he
could
not
then
subcontract.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
--
that
is
the
entire
question
if
i
may
say
you
mr.
justice
whittaker.
because
if
we
are
right
in
a
particular
provision
that
it
does
relate
--
relate
itself
directly
to
wages,
hours,
and
conditions
of
employment,
any
other
agreement
must
have
necessity
yield
although
we
are
not
trying
to
inject
ourselves
into
an
area
in
which
we
don't
belong.
and
again
i
say
this.
supposing
we
say
that
there
shall
be
no
subcontracting,
there
shall
be
no
use
of
other
equipment
until
all
of
the
equipment
of
this
particular
employer
is
put
in
service
which
is
a
provision
found
in
this
contract.
now,
that
of
necessity
is
going
to
restrict
somebody
else
who
wants
to
lease
a
piece
of
equipment
to
this
carrier,
from
leasing
it
at
anytime
when
there's
unused
equipment.
we
say
in
this
contract
that
if
equipment
is
leased
we
want
that
equipment
to
be
driven
by
an
employee
of
the
carrier.
now
this
affects
revel
oliver
because
he
wants
to
lease
the
equipment
with
a
driver.
now
he
may
do
it
to
anybody
he
wants,
he
can
enter
into
that
lease.
but
if
we
have
an
agreement
with
a
particular
carrier
and
this
is
a
legitimate
labor
agreement,
it's
legitimate,
(inaudible)
clause.
he
is
going
to
be
inhibited
from
exercising
a
privilege
of
having
a
lease
which
has
a
different
term.
and
we
don't
say
we
have
the
right
to
rewrite
those
leases.
but
we
say
if
we
have
a
right
which
the
act
gives
us
and
we
insist
it
does
have,
to
negotiate
in
the
area
of
wages,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment,
we
will
on
necessity
from
time
to
time
infringe
upon
other
relationships
which
our
employer
may
have
with
other
persons.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
we're
getting
into
an
area
of
balance
at
that
particular
point.
in
other
words,
we
wouldn't
say
that
in
order
to
protect
our
wages,
we're
going
to
keep
everybody
from
baltimore
from
working
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now
that
may
have
a
direct
effect
upon
us
and
it
might,
under
reasonable
circumstances
be
a
negotiable
matter.
but
that
--
but
again
it's
a
matter
of
balance
if
in
doing
that,
other
conflicting
social
or
economic
interest
are
involved,
that
i
think
the
job
is
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
ultimately
i
suppose
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
are
confining
ourselves
to
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
in
a
reasonable
and
in
a
contemplated
matter
or
whether
under
the
guise
of
that
kind
of
negotiation,
we
have
extended
ourselves
into
areas
in
which
we
do
not
properly
belong.
mr.
david
previant
it
has
--
it
has
one
further
jurisdiction
in
that
regard
or
perhaps
two.
there's
a
provision
of
the
act
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
--
in
every
union
to
coerce
an
employer
or
an
independent
contractor
into
membership
in
the
labor
union.
so,
we'd
have
at
least
that.
i
think
you
would
then
--
mr.
david
previant
relating
to
independent
contractors.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
think
this
raise
--
it
might,
within
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
it
says
to
the
union
or
it
says
to
the
independent
contractor.
should
any
union
try
to
force
you
in,
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
we'll
adjudicate
it.
mr.
david
previant
independent
contractors
and
not
employees
for
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
they
--
as
they
have
defined
in
the
act.
but
there
are
many
places
in
which
activities
of
an
independent
contractor
or
matters
relating
to
an
independent
contractor
will
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
act.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
frankly
to
say
on
what
basis
with
it.
we
--
we
don't
quarrel
about
it,
that
revel
oliver
being
an
independent
contractor
and
so
far
he
is
in
the
leasing
business.
but
that's
not
incompatible
with
his
being
an
employee
when
he
drives
a
truck.
and
that's
not
incompatible
with
our
saying,
we
don't
care
if
he
leases
the
equipment
but
when
you
do,
we
want
our
employees
to
be
driving
that
equipment
and
not
strangers
from
the
outside
because
we
want
to
preserve
our
work
for
the
people
who
are
right
here
at
this
plant,
working
for
this
carrier.
in
other
words,
if
we've
got
10
people
who
are
employed
by
this
particular
carrier,
we
wouldn't
want
that
carrier
to
hire
10
pieces
of
equipment
driven
by
persons
who
are
stranger
to
the
carrier
with
our
people
who
are
employed.
now
that's
a
matter
for
negotiation.
we
have
negotiated
that
kind
of
a
provision.
now
insofar
as
the
negotiation
of
that
kind
of
a
provision
may
do
some
damage
to
mr.
oliver,
then
we
plead
guilty.
but
we
say
this
is
a
matter
which
we
have
a
right
to
do
and
we
can't
conceive
of
any
economic
negotiation
that
it
was
not
going
to
in
some
ways
embarrass
or
injure
in
some
way
some
similar
or
competing
economic
interest.
that
is
what
collective
bargaining
is.
mr.
david
previant
precisely
so.
mr.
david
previant
meadowbrook
carrier,
precisely
so.
you
also
held
so
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
involving
the
bakeries.
you
also
held
so
in
the
--
i
think
it
was
another
bakery
case.
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
that
is
precisely
our
position,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
previant
that
--
that
is
our
position
and
that
has
been
our
position
throughout
this
litigation.
section
4
which
we
have
been
talking
about
at
least
obliquely
and
perhaps
directly
of
article
32,
deals
with
this
problem
of
who
shall
drive
leased
equipment.
now
that
--
that
section
provides
that
all
leased
equipment
shall
be
operated
by
an
employee
of
the
carrier.
and
it
also
provides,
the
language
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
this
court
has
used.
that
the
carrier
reserves
the
right
to
control
the
manner,
means
and
details
often
by
which
the
owner-operator
performs
the
services
as
well
as
the
ends
to
be
accomplished.
in
other
words,
we
wanted
to
make
perfectly
sure
that
this
man
on
a
piece
of
leased
equipment,
usually
the
fellow
who
owns
just
that
single
piece
of
equipment.
when
he
enters
the
service
of
a
carrier
with
whom
we
have
a
contract
will
become
an
employee
of
that
carrier.
will
be
subject
to
and
get
the
benefits
of
the
labor
agreement
which
we
have
negotiated
with
that
character
--
with
that
carrier.
and
so
we
wrote
the
right
of
control
test
into
that
particular
section
so
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
we
were
talking
and
not
what
we
wanted
and
what
we
negotiated
was
the
fact
that
only
employees
of
the
carrier
would
be
driving
leased
equipment.
section
5,
incidentally
has
the
other
requirement
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
that
the
carrier
must
use
his
own
available
equipment
before
he
goes
to
the
outside
and
use
the
equipment.
mr.
david
previant
there
is
a
union
shop
provision,
i
believe
it's
article
2,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
previant
it
--
well,
it
so
happens
that
revel
oliver
has
been
a
member
of
the
union
for
a
number
of
years.
but
it
would
apply
to
him
if
under
the
language
of
the
contract
and
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
if
he
drove
in
the
service
of
the
carrier
for
30
days
or
more,
he
would
then
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
it
does.
and
--
and
only
however
in
his
situation
as
a
driver
of
equipment
and
apparently
we
were
unsuccessful
in
selling
this
concept
to
the
ohio
courts.
they
kept
on
looking
at
mr.
oliver
as
a
lessor
of
equipment.
the
--
in
our
opinion
ignored
the
aspect
of
his
relationship
in
which
he's
a
driver,
driving
like
everybody
else
on
the
highway
subject
to
all
of
the
terms
and
conditions.
and
who
--
if
we
have
no
right
to
negotiate
his
wages
and
conditions
could
very
well
destroy
the
very
wages
and
conditions
we
have
negotiated
for
every
driver
who
sits
on
the
same
truck
and
drives
on
the
same
highway
and
is
subject
to
the
same
environmental
problems
of
stresses
and
strains,
and
economic
stresses
and
strains
as
any
other
driver.
mr.
david
previant
they
would
become
--
yes,
because
they
would
become
employees
of
the
carrier.
they
are
not
his
employees.
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
by
reason
of
our
agreement
with
the
carrier
that
anybody
who
drives
equipment
in
his
service
shall
be
his
employee
and
shall
receive
the
full
benefit
of
the
union
contract.
now,
as
i
say
this
is
a
subcontracting
clause
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
board's
decisions
on
the
right
of
the
union
to
negotiate
subcontracting
clauses,
the
court
decisions,
the
arbitration,
decisions,
i
don't
think
at
this
date,
there
can
be
any
argument
about
it.
nevertheless,
the
ohio
court
in
voiding
article
32
in
toto
also
voided
article
4
and
said
that
we
could
not
negotiate
the
employee
status
of
drivers
of
leased
equipment
who
are
operating
in
the
service
of
an
employer
with
whom
we
have
a
contract.
now
the
other
provisions
of
this
contract
and
instead
of
going
into
detail,
we
have
them
analyzed
in
the
brief.
eliminate
a
lot
of
common
evils
which
had
grown
up
in
connection
with
this
and
we
have
the
record
on
it.
we
have
the
--
one
of
the
chief
employer
negotiators
who
testified
section
by
section
as
to
the
origin
of
the
article.
how
it
came
about.
why
the
union
wanted
it?
what
was
the
specific
condition
which
they
were
seeking
to
meet?
all
of
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
it.
i
want
to
get
to
section
12
which
is
the
key
provision
and
which
we
feel
the
ohio
courts
were
so
obsessed
with
that
they
lost
complete
cite
of
the
general
picture
and
perhaps
this
is
our
fault
and
not
the
ohio
court's
fault,
perhaps
we
didn't
present
it
properly.
but
section
12
of
this
agreement
--
of
article
32
sets
forth
minimum
lease
rates
for
a
certain
described
and
defined
types
of
equipment.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
has
no
application
to
any
equipment
which
is
not
driven
by
the
owner.
when
revel
oliver
leases
six
pieces
of
equipment
to
a
carrier,
he
can
lease
it
for
any
rate
he
wants.
the
only
way
this
contract
infringes
upon
that
is
we
say
that
the
driver
of
that
equipment
must
be
an
employee
and
receive
the
benefits
of
this
contract.
but
he
is
free
to
negotiate
any
kind
of
a
lease
rate
he
wants
for
the
use
of
his
equipment.
but
when
he
drives
his
own
equipment,
this
minimum
lease
rate
applies
just
as
it
applies
to
the
more
typical
owner-operator
who
owns
only
one
piece
of
equipment
and
comes
to
the
service
of
the
carrier
who
has
a
contract
with
us
and
starts
to
drive
that
piece
of
equipment
in
the
service
of
that
carrier.
and
i
--
and
i
think
the
reason
is
so
simple
perhaps
that's
why
we
--
we
haven't
persuaded
the
ohio
courts.
and
let
me
give
you
--
we
have
the
exact
example
in
the
brief
with
the
exact
rates
which
are
set
forth
in
the
brief.
but
in
the
interest
of
simplicity,
let
me
give
you
a
simple
example.
in
this
kind
of
operation
generally,
the
rate
of
pay
is
per
mile.
over
the
road
long
distance
drivers
and
they
get
paid
per
mile
as
to
the
total
number
of
miles
which
they
may
have
driven
during
the
course
rule.
now
let's
assume
that
this
particular
driver's
rate
is
10
cents
a
mile.
now
he
has
leased
his
equipment
to
the
carrier,
and
understand
this
again,
it
is
only
when
he
is
driving
his
own
equipment
that
this
particular
article
5
section
applies.
now,
he
has
leased
his
equipment
to
the
carrier,
too
and
he
has
leased
this
equipment
to
the
carrier
for
5
cents
per
mile.
now
he's
getting
a
total
of
15
cents
a
mile
for
every
mile
he
is
driving
in
the
service
of
carrier.
but
lo
and
behold
after
several
weeks
he
finds
out
that
it
is
costing
him
8
cents
a
mile
to
operate
his
equipment.
in
other
words,
he
is
taking
a
beating
in
his
equipment
pocket
for
3
cents
a
mile.
where
does
it
come
from?
now,
the
10
cents
a
mile
driver's
rate
is
no
longer
a
10
cents
a
mile
driver's
rate.
it's
a
7
cents
a
mile
driver's
rate.
because
he
has
had
to
take
that
3
cents
subtracted
from
his
driver's
rate
and
put
into
his
equipment
pocket
so
that
he
comes
out
on
the
equipment.
this
kind
of
a
thing
is
what
this
contract
was
designed
to
prevent
and
only
that.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
you're
right
your
honor
but
they
didn't
decide
that.
we
--
we
would
not
have
complained
if
they
had
said
that
because
we
haven't
tried
to
fix
the
rates
on
the
other
trucks.
we
haven't
tried
to
fix
the
rates
on
any
truck
belonging
to
revel
oliver
except
the
truck
which
he
himself
drives.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
doubt
that
that
is
sufficient
but
i
say
it
is
not
because
again,
if
we
are
right
in
our
basic
premise,
that
what
we
have
done
here
is
negotiated
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions,
the
fact
that
one
person
maybe
an
employee
only
occasionally
would
not
mean
that
we
were
wrong
in
principle
or
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
lost
its
jurisdiction
because
he's
only
a
sometime
employee
as
compared
to
a
full-time
employee.
and
that's
all
that
--
that's
happened
here
and
he
was
a
sometime
employee.
but
he
was
no
different
than
any
other
employee
who
might
drive
occasionally.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
he
does
not
undercut
the
contractual
provision
whether
he's
an
owner-operator
or
whether
he's
a
driver
himself.
if
we're
right
in
our
basic
theory
and
believe
we
are
that
we've
got
a
right
to
protect
these
wages
and
that
what
we
have
done
here
is
not
negotiated
a
profit
for
anybody.
but
have
merely
established
a
minimum
lease
rate
to
assure
the
payment
of
wages
and
incidentally
owner-operators
can
go
out
and
negotiate
anything
about
the
minimum
they
pleased.
there
is
no
inhibition
on
that.
the
record
shows
that
this
minimum
lease
rate
is
set
so
low
that
as
a
matter
of
practical
effect,
most
carriers
are
paying
more
than
the
minimum
lease
rate.
and
the
one
carrier
who
testified
is
one
of
the
largest
carriers
in
the
country.
he
said
that
he
could
not
operate
his
equipment
for
what
we
establish
as
a
minimum
lease
rate
in
order
to
protect
wages.
in
other
words,
we
may
not
actually
be
giving
those
drivers
all
of
the
protection
that
we
try
to
give
them.
we
may
have
set
a
lower
rate
than
is
required
by
the
circumstances.
but
in
setting
that
rate
and
the
record
shows
this,
intensive
studies
were
made
of
the
various
factors
which
entered
into
determining
how
much
it
does
cost
to
operate
trucks
of
various
sizes
over
their
normal
life
span.
the
carriers
did
most
of
the
work
i
believe
and
the
union
did
some
on
their
own.
we
--
we
have
to
find
out
the
cost
of
the
equipment
and
depreciate
it.
the
gas,
the
oil,
the
tires,
the
maintenance,
everything
that
enters
into
the
cost
of
operation
of
the
piece
of
equipment
was
considered
when
we
set
the
minimum
lease
rate
and
we
tried
to
fix
it
right
there.
mr.
david
previant
well,
he's
not
an
independent
contractor
mr.
justice
whittaker
because
under
our
contract
he
becomes
an
employee.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
the
answer
is
that
we
were
in
the
very
unfortunate
position
of
not
being
able
to
enforce
the
contract
that
made
him
an
employee
so
the
court
said
that
he's
an
independent
contractor.
but
the
very
courts
that
said
we
can't
make
him
an
employee,
the
courts
have
found
he
was
an
independent
contractor.
in
other
words,
and
it's
in
the
record,
but
for
the
restraining
orders
that
had
been
entered
in
this
case,
the
carriers,
and
they
so
testified,
would
have
complied
fully
with
the
provisions
of
our
contract.
have
they
complied
fully
with
the
provisions
of
our
contract?
it
would
have
been
no
doubt
that
revel
oliver
when
he
drove
his
own
truck
was
an
employee
and
we
had
established
a
minimum
lease
rate
only
for
that
piece
of
equipment.
and
again,
i
beg
to
emphasize
just
as
strenuously
as
i
can,
we
have
no
interest
in
any
other
piece
of
equipment
which
revel
oliver
may
own
or
lease
to
anybody
except
the
piece
he
drives
and
then
we
are
interested
in
the
rates.
the
only
other
interest
we
have
is
that
when
he
leases
that
equipment
to
somebody
else,
that
equipment
be
driven
by
an
employee
of
that
one
and
that
mr.
revel
oliver,
not
the
brokery,
human
services,
as
well
as
equipment.
that's
our
interest.
mr.
david
previant
we
--
we
have
another
argument
here
on
--
i
see
preemption
but
it's
preemption
of
one
form
or
the
other,
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
well,
first
let
me
say
that
i
don't
believe
that
whether
the
board
could
do
something
or
not
is
necessarily
pertinent
because
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there's
a
remedy.
mr.
david
previant
well,
there
are
many
things
--
there
are
many
things
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
--
i
think
the
board
can
do
that.
mr.
david
previant
if
--
if
the
board
did
that,
we
would
have
to
find
some
other
way
in
which
we
could
afford
protection
through
this
particular
kind
of
thing.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right
mr.
justice
black.
and
if
the
board
disagrees
with
that,
then
we're
subject
to
the
antitrust
act
in
ohio
and
every
place
else.
if
the
board
disagrees
with
us
that,
number
one,
we've
got
a
right
to
get
the
subcontracting
clause.
number
two,
that
these
minimum
lease
rates,
if
the
board
disagrees,
says
that
these
minimum
lease
rates
do
not
in
its
opinion,
have
a
reasonable
and
direct
relationship
to
this
entire
matrix
of
collective
bargaining
which
has
been
confided
to
them
by
the
congress
then
we're
through
with
this
kind
of
provision
in
any
state
unless
the
state
has
more
than
an
antitrust
act.
mr.
david
previant
unless
we
have
the
other
preemption
trial
in
which
we
have
raised
here
and
we
think
that
there's
great
merit
because
of
the
fact
that
we
do
have
this
detailed
regulation
of
leases
at
least
up
to
this
point
made
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
mc-43.
mr.
david
previant
excuse
me.
mr.
david
previant
that's
our
sole
interest.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
because
if
you
multiply
revel
oliver
by
many
hundreds
or
thousands
in
this
area
then
we
have
of
course
lost
the
protection
of
the
contract
because
each
one
of
those
fellows
driving
his
own
equipment,
taking
a
beating
on
the
equipment
then,
has
got
to
take
a
beating
on
the
wage
end
and
he's
undercutting
our
wages
and
he
does
that.
we're
not
getting
the
benefits
of
our
agreement.
now,
to
show
that
there
is
some
reasonable
relationship
to
what
we're
doing
into
collective
bargaining,
we
only
point
out
that
the
board
has
said
that
items
like
stock
ownership
options
are
vulnerable.
the
cost
of
meals
in
company-owned
cafeteria,
the
rent
paid
for
company-owned
homes,
group
insurance,
pension,
all
of
these
things
while
they
are
not
stated
in
terms
of
8
cents
an
hour
or
8
cents
a
week
have
a
direct
relationship
to
the
wage
structure
at
a
particular
place,
and
we
say
that
this
too
has
that
direct
relationship.
and
this
court
has
said
in
this
seniority
case
involving
the
ford
motor
company
that
the
union
has
a
wide
discretion
in
dealing
with
both
exceptional
and
typical
employment
conditions.
and
this
is
one
of
the
unusual
employment
conditions
which
--
at
least
it's
an
--
it's
unusual
in
industry
generally.
it's
peculiar
to
the
trucking
industry.
it's
a
matter
which
as
i've
said,
the
unions
have
been
negotiating
on
and
had
tried
to
protect
the
employees
and
the
owner-operators
on
for
some
20
years
already
under
this
contract.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
and
i
--
i
would
not
want
to
have
my
answer
considered
in
agreement
that
a
charge
is
necessary
because
there
--
there
are
many
areas
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
well,
yes.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that's
true
but
we
also
argued
that
whether
or
not
there's
a
remedy
is
not
important
because
just
like
picketing
and
striking
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
but
where
the
board
or
this
court
has
had
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
and
they're
not
to
be
--
need
not
be
remedied.
but
--
and
we
have
set
this
forth
i
believe
more
extensively
in
our
reply
brief,
revel
oliver
could
have
complained
that
when
we
went
up
on
a
strike
in
1955,
we
were
trying
to
compel
him,
an
independent
contractor
to
join
a
union
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
i
referred
to.
he
could
have
filed
a
petition
for
an
election
trying
to
establish
a
unit
of
his
own
trucks
and
the
people
who
drove
his
own
trucks.
the
employers
might
have
filed
a
charge
of
unfair
labor
practice
saying
that
this
was
not
a
bargain
of
the
matter
to
begin
with.
we
went
on
strike
among
other
things
to
get
this.
now,
the
employers
at
that
point
might
have
--
might
have
gone
to
the
board
and
said,
“wait
a
minute,
these
fellows
are
striking
to
get
us
to
violate
the
ohio
antitrust
act.
we
want
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charged
against
them.”
this
is
not
bargaining
matter
that's
why
they're
not
bargaining
collectively
in
good
faith.
they
could
have
done
that.
there
were
and
are
remedies
available
that
that
becomes
important.
we
don't
believe
it
is.
i
think
what
is
important
is
what
was
the
intent?
is
there
a
reasonable
relationship
to
that
intent
and
have
we
gone
about
our
business
in
such
a
manner
although
we
may
have
violated
a
state
law.
that
state
law
should
not
be
part
of
us,
a
right
which
the
federal
act
gives
to
us.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
initially
it
has
some
significance
that
he
might
had
been
bound
by
the
contract
that
was
made.
it
was
never
seriously
urged
and
--
but
i
don't
believe
it
has
--
has
any
significance
except
that
it
may
very
well
be
so
that
in
other
relationships
in
past
years
under
this
contract,
he
did
become
an
employee
and
became
a
member
of
the
union.
the
--
i
suppose
the
thing
that
i
or
i
should
keep
on
emphasizing
because
again
i
--
i'm
afraid
that
we
didn't
do
it
hard
enough,
is
that
we
don't
care
what
revel
oliver
gets
for
his
equipment.
if
he
is
an
owner-operator
like
every
other
owner-operator,
he
is
driving
his
own
piece
of
equipment.
we
want
to
be
sure
he
gets
the
wages.
and
we
believe
we
have
a
right
to
say
that
when
he
leases
his
equipment
to
somebody
under
contract
with
us
and
he
doesn't
have
to
but
when
he
does,
then
the
people
who
drive
those
trucks
shall
be
employees
of
the
carrier
and
come
under
this
contract.
and
at
that
point,
of
course
we
don't
care
what
the
--
what
revel
oliver
is
getting
for
the
piece
of
equipment
they
drive.
again,
we're
interested
principally
in
the
man
who
owns
and
drives
his
own
single
piece
of
equipment
and
that's
all
that
this
contract
is
about.
and
we
don't
know
if
it's
immaterial,
whether
the
state
property
in
terms
of
this
antitrust
act.
it's
immaterial
whether
the
state
was
right
or
wrong
under
its
law,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
is
an
independent
contract.
the
inquiry
didn't
have
a
jurisdiction
to
make
those
determinations
and
come
to
that
result
without
impinging
upon
rights
which
we
have
under
the
federal
act
or
which
the
federal
government
has
said
shall
be
adjudicated
solely
in
the
federal
process.
mr.
david
previant
oh
no.
it
happens
in
all
fields
and
especially
in
the
labor
dispute.
i
mean
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
cases
in
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
said,
“this
man
can
be
a
lessor
when
he
leases
his
equipment
but
he
can
also
be
an
employee
when
he
drives
it.”
and
--
mr.
david
previant
i
don't
believe
so
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
i'm
sure.
this
court
has
--
has
always
said
that
what
maybe
an
employee
under
the
internal
revenue
act
may
not
be
an
employee
under
the
wagner
act
or
vice-versa.
i
think
this
court
has
always
looked
upon
the
--
that
question
in
the
context
of
the
particular
law
which
is
before
of
the
court
and
what
was
the
purpose
and
the
intent
of
the
congress
when
that
law
was
drafted?
who
did
they
intend
to
encompass
within
the
reach
of
that
law?
and
it
can
depend
also
upon
the
different
facts
but
surely
it
should
not
depend
upon
the
different
adjudications
in
48
different
states
which
is
what
we
would
get
into
if
we
say
here
ohio
is
going
to
make
the
adjudication
under
its
antitrust
act.
and
then
per
chance
new
york
at
a
later
date
and
per
chance
kansas
at
a
later
date
and
per
chance
mississippi
at
a
later
date.and
we
think
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
this
court
has
in
some
cases
made
the
ultimate
determination
and
in
some
cases
it
has
said
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
make
a
determination
but
for
the
labor
board.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
these
kinds
of
cases
where
you
--
you
do
have
a
lot
of
room
for
expertise
because
the
question
of
what
is
directly
related
to
negotiable
matters,
it
would
be
well
for
the
board
to
make
the
initial
determination
rather
than
for
this
court
to
do
so.
but
i
would
not
presume
to
say
to
this
court
that
it
has
to
be
one
way
or
the
other
because
i
believe
this
court
in
preemption
cases
has
in
some
instances
made
the
determination
without
the
matter
as
going
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
that
this
was
a
protected
activity
or
this
was
in
a
preempted
field
and
therefore
the
states
had
no
jurisdiction.
in
other
instances,
this
court
has
said,
“well,
we
don't
know
what
the
board
will
do
when
it
gets
to
it.
when
the
particular
matter
gets
to
the
board
but
we
do
know
that
the
state
can't
do
anything
about
it.
that
it
is
a
matter
for
board
adjudication."
they
say
what
the
--
what
the
court
feels
might
be
appropriate
and
in
this
case
--
well,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
court
feels
because
just
reading
the
court's
decisions,
you
--
you
would
then
adjust
to
that
in
--
in
different
types
of
situations.
in
the
short
work
stoppages,
you
--
you
said
no,
you
called
a
halt
right
there.
in
the
strike
situations,
in
the
public
utility
situations,
you
said
no
right
there.
in
some
of
the
secondary
boycott
situations,
you
said,
“well,
we
don't
know
what
the
board
will
do
but
surely
the
state
has
no
right
to
do
anything
about
it.
we
will
let
the
board
make
the
final
decision
in
these
kinds
of
matters.”
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
don't
think
we've
done
this
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
the
automobile
workers
like
any
other
union
can
go
to
their
employer
and
say,
“we've
got
a
machine
shop.
we've
got
confident
help.
don't
you
find
this
workout?
we
want
it
here.”
i
think
they've
got
a
right
to
do
it.
they
do
it
particularly,
i
think
you'll
find
it
in
most
major
contracts
in
the
country.
we
haven't
tried
to
set
a
price
for
anybody.
we
could
--
i
believe
that
we
had
wanted
to.
i
believe
that
we
might
have
forced
a
nationwide
strike
and
said
that
we'd
do
it
in
under
any
circumstances
on
any
carrier
under
contract
with
us
to
ever
use
an
owner-operator.
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
marketing
demand.
it
always
has
been.
now,
we
affected
the
compromise.
mr.
david
previant
if
the
court
please.
i
think
that
i
have
some
five
minutes
left
of
my
time.
i
was
so
advised
and
i
should
like
to
devote
that
very
brief
time
to
making
more
definitive
answer
to
a
question
which
was
put
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument
yesterday.
the
question
as
i
recall
it
was
whether
or
not
there
was
any
significance
to
the
fact
or
should
be
attached
to
the
fact
that
these
leases
or
contracts
of
transportation
or
at
least
the
one
which
appears
in
the
record
was
executed
prior
to
the
execution
of
the
1955
contract
which
was
the
subject
of
litigation.
i
feel
that
the
findings
of
the
ohio
courts
and
the
judgment
of
the
ohio
courts
make
it
clear
that
this
case
was
not
litigated
on
the
idea
of
any
malicious
interference
with
an
existing
contract
right,
but
that
it
was
litigated
on
the
idea
that
this
contract
was
per
se
in
violation
of
the
particular
statute
of
the
state
of
ohio
which
is
here
involved.
at
page
256
of
the
record,
it
appears
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
and
i
would
call
to
this
court's
attention,
finding
2
(d)
that
article
32
squarely
is
in
conflict
with
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
ohio
as
reflected
on
section
1331.01
revised
code.
and
it
is
void
and
unenforceable.
the
court
goes
on
in
its
judgment
and
it's
the
first
paragraph
of
its
judgment
to
say
that
the
defendants
are
hereby
perpetually
restrained
and
enjoined
from
entering
into
any
agreements
one
with
the
other
or
carrying
out
the
effects,
requirements
or
terms
of
any
such
agreement
which
will
require
the
alteration,
cancellation,
or
violation
of
plaintiff-appellee's
existing
lease
or
leasing
agreement
or
any
such
agreement
hereafter
renewed
or
renegotiated
and
entered
into.
the
court
then
goes
on
in
subsequent
paragraphs
to
restrain
these
defendants
from
any
such
contracts
in
the
future
and
perpetually
enjoins
and
restrains
us
from
it
anytime
enforcing
section
30
--
article
32
of
the
contract.
i
think
throughout
the
litigation,
the
opinions
of
the
court,
the
findings
of
the
courts
below,
the
judgment
of
the
courts
below,
the
question
presented
was
whether
or
not,
this
article
of
this
contract
was
per
se
void
not
whether
or
not
it
happened
to
interfere
with
any
particular
existing
lease
arrangement
of
revel
oliver
or
anybody
else
is.
i
might
say
in
that
regard
that
if
that
were
all
that
were
involved
in
this
case,
that
matter
could
have
and
probably
would
have
been
settled
in
the
collective
bargaining
table.
and
i
would
assume
that
we
do
not
have
any
right
to
enter
into
a
contract
at
this
time
which
would
completely
destroy
existing
contracts
which
a
carrier
may
have
with
someone
else.
that's
a
matter
for
bargaining
and
i
supposed
it's
a
matter
for
exclusion
of
existing
contracts
during
the
course
of
bargaining.
but
that
isn't
this
case.
this
is
not
the
case
of
where
the
plaintiff
comes
in
and
asked
only
that
we
refrained
from
maliciously
interfering
with
an
existing
agreement.
he
comes
in
and
says
that
our
collective
bargaining
contract
is
completely
void
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
ohio
as
expressed
in
the
antitrust
act
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
therefore
we
are
perpetually
restrained
from
enforcing
that
contract
as
to
him
and
as
to
anybody
else.
not
only
as
to
existing
contracts
but
as
to
contracts
he
made,
enter
into
with
carriers
in
the
future.
so
we
believe
that
that
particular
point
was
not
an
issue.
i
would
further
point
out
as
i
indicated
yesterday
that
the
1952
contract
containing
the
identical
provision,
article
32
was
restrained
upon
its
execution
and
while
it
was
under
the
cover
of
that
restraint,
that
the
1953
lease
was
entered
into.
and
then
that
restraint
was
again
imposed
upon
the
1955
contract
subsequently
litigated
all
the
way
through
to
completion.
so,
as
i
said
yesterday,
if
these
restraints
have
not
been
imposed,
the
carrier
as
he
testified
would
have
been
in
compliance
with
the
contract
and
many
of
the
issues
which
were
adjudicated
in
ohio
under
--
under
those
facts
would
not
have
been
subject
to
adjudication
in
our
opinion.
the
--
mr.
david
previant
article
32
is
set
forth
--
mr.
david
previant
--
bodily
at
page
144
of
the
record
in
which
the
contract
itself
appears
--
mr.
david
previant
--
and
the
particular
article
itself
your
honor.
mr.
david
previant
can
be
located
it
at
page
38.
it
is
also
set
forth
in
each
opinion
of
the
--
of
each
ohio
court
and
it
is
also
set
forth
i
think
at
length
that
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents
here.
mr.
david
previant
well,
if
the
--
i
think
there
are
number
of
ways
in
which
it
can
be
submitted
to
the
labor
board.
it
can
be
submitted
in
the
posture
of
whether
or
not
when
we
ask
for
this
kind
of
an
agreement
whether
we
are
bargaining
collectively
and
in
good
faith.
in
other
words,
is
this
within
the
area
of
either
compulsory
or
permissive
bargaining
which
this
court
refer
to
in
the
borg-warner
case.
now
if
we
are
insisting
that
an
employer
signed
this
agreement
with
this
article
in
it
and
if
the
labor
board
is
satisfied
that
it
so
unrelated
to
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions,
it
could
find
us
guilty,
so
to
speak,
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
do
an
order
restraining
us
from
seeking
to
negotiate
this
particular
article.
that
is
one
way
in
which
it
could
have
been
presented
to
the
board.
it
could
have
been
presented
to
the
board
by
mr.
oliver
in
one
or
two
postures.
he
might
have
gone
to
the
board
and
said
that
we
were
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
we
were
insisting
that
he,
as
an
independent
contractor,
become
a
member
of
our
labor
union.
that
is
a
specific
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act.
labor
union
has
no
right
to
force
an
independent
contractor
to
become
a
member
of
a
labor
union.
he
could
have
complained
about
that.
he
might
have
filed
a
petition
for
representation
claiming
that
he
and
his
employees
or
rather
that
his
employees
were
a
separate
unit
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
and
the
board
in
that
proceeding
could
have
determined
whether
or
not
he
was
an
employer,
whether
or
not
his
employees
--
were
employees
of
his
and
whether
or
not,
we
could
make
them
employees
of
someone
else.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
proceeding
now
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
growing
out
of
these
very
same
circumstances
although
the
parties
are
not
identical,
in
which
as
a
result
of
this
restraining
order,
the
union
did
make
a
request
upon
the
so-called
fleet
owners
to
bargain
with
the
union
pending
the
resolution
of
this
problem
in
the
courts.
and
when
the
fleet
owners
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union,
the
union
struck
the
fleet
owners
and
picketed
at
the
premises
of
a.c.e.
now
the
board,
contrary
to
the
finding
of
what
i
should
i
say
this.
the
trial
examiner
found
that
a.c.e.
and
the
fleet
owners
were
co-employers.
and
therefore,
this
was
not
a
secondary
boycott
situation.
the
board
reversed
that
finding
of
the
trial
examiner.
the
board
found
that
the
fleet
owner
was
the
sole
employer
and
therefore
when
we
picketed
at
the
a.c.e.
premises.
we
were
engaging
in
a
secondary
boycott.
we
have
taken
that
matter
on
appeal,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
things,
number
one,
this
is
a
fine
example
of
how
productive
of
strike
the
interference
of
the
state
court
and
the
state
agencies
has
been
in
this
case
because
were
it
not
for
the
restraining
order
entered
in
this
case
which
is
now
before
this
court
saying
that
we
could
not
enforce
the
provisions
of
this
contract,
there
would
have
been
no
question
but
that
these
people
would
have
been
employees
of
a.c.e.
and
that
we
would
have
been
in
the
legitimate
labor
dispute.
thank
you.
mr.
david
previant
i
believed
that's
the
answer
to
the
problem
with
norris-laguardia
that
affects
only
to
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
not
the
state
courts.
mr.
david
previant
it's
a
limitation
on
federal
court
jurisdiction.
