mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
think
the
question
that
you
have
asked
was
probably
more
important
to
you
than
the
subject
that
i
might
discuss
and
i
would
like
to
continue
on
if
nothing
to
answer
the
question
which
you
have
raised.
now,
you're
a
supposition,
of
course,
it
isn't
in
the
case.
it
didn't
occur.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
supposition
would
be
that
the
carriers,
let's
say,
did
not
sign
the
contract,
so
that
the
question
could
have
been
presented
to
the
board.
see
the
facts
are
that
this
contract
is
negotiated
in
--
in
the
chicago
for
very
few
deputies
representing
these
3500
carriers,
so
that
my
two
clients
would
have
very
little
voice
in
the
ultimate
result
of
the
negotiation.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
no.
oh,
no.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
no.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
--
this
could
have
gone
to
the
board
if
we
would
have
refused
to
sign
the
contract.
and
then
there
would
have
been
a
complaint
made
that
here
that
there
was
a
demand
that
the
negotiated
contract
which
is
made
by
our
agent
should
be
put
in
writing.
that
could
have
gone
to
the
board
that
way
if
we
had
refused
to
sign.
the
union
could
have
taken
it
there.
and
under
the
law
and
the
board
would
had
only
one
duty
to
perform.had
the
contract
been
negotiated?
was
it
made
on
our
behalf?
had
our
agents
agreed
to
it?
they
would
have
ordered
us
to
sign
it.
now
bear
in
mind
that
the
board,
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
a
statutory
board,
it
does
not
have
the
jurisdiction
that
any
court
has.
it
has
that
narrow
jurisdiction
of
looking
at
one
statute,
interpreting
that
statute
and
enforcing
that
statute
with
blinders
on
the
side
of
its
heads
as
to
the
other
laws
affecting
the
relations
of
the
parties.
that
board
has
no
antitrust
jurisdiction.
it
has
no
duties
or
responsibilities
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws.
so
that
when
this
question
would
come
up
as
to
the
narrow
issue
then
we
either
had
refused
to
bargain
on
this
article
32
or
we
refused
to
sign
a
contract
with
that
in
it,
all
the
board
would
have
said,
it
was
a
--
they
probably
would
have
said
that
it
was
a
subject
to
bargain.
that
one
was
requiring
subjects
but
a
permissible
subject
to
bargaining.
it
would
have
told
us
to
bargain
on
it.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that
board
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
it
--
i
would
say
that
possibly
the
board
could
have
ordered
us
to
bargain
on
it.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
on
this?
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh
no,
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
no.
i'm
making
an
assumption
to
approach
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
i
don't
think
that
if
--
they
would
have
--
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
--
all
of
those
requirements
that
you
will
find
in
article
32
never
been
required
except
in
bargaining
required
that
we
give
up
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
that
maybe
the
case
where
there
was
an
accusation
that
we
were
affirming
it
out
to
interfere
with
the
union
or
interfere
with
some
of
their
rights.
this
was
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
this
has
been
historical.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
i'll
go
along
with
your
assumption
that
they
would
have
ordered
us
to
bargain
on
it
because
that
won't
change
my
result.
the
board
still
would
have
been
looking
at
the
narrow
issue
of
a.c.e.
in
the
one
case,
interstate
in
the
other
case
versus
the
board
and
the
employees
and
it
still
would
not
have
had
at
any
jurisdiction
under
the
antitrust.
the
question
wouldn't
even
been
presented
to
them.
now,
i
wanted
to
discuss
just
a
little
bit
the
icc
section,
the
question
in
which
it
was
raised
in
brief
and
wasn't
argued
here
and
i'm
only
saying
that
now
because
a
decision
of
this
court
germane
to
that
subject,
i
believe
will
answer
the
question
we're
on.
in
the
southern
rate
case,
the
state
of
georgia
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
that's
not
cited
in
my
brief,
324
u.s.439.
in
that
case,
the
state
of
georgia
was
accusing
the
northern
railroads
of
preferring
northern
industry
and
northern
states
above
the
interest
of
the
southern
states
particularly
state
of
georgia
and
their
industry.
and
so
they
made
a
request
to
file
an
original
action
in
this
case,
in
this
court
under
the
constitution.
and
this
case
was
a
discussion
of
that
--
of
the
right
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
bring
that
action
in
this
court
under
that
constitutional
provision.
there
was
no
question
in
this
--
in
the
decision
to
what
the
icc
was
the
only
body
that
could
remove
the
rates
or
could
control
the
rates.
this
court
had
no
authority
on
that
subject.
but
the
court
recognized
this
and
said
this.
that
these
subordinate
congressional
boards
do
not
have
antitrust
jurisdiction.
and
so
while
the
icc
would
look
at
an
isolated
rate
by
a
particular
railroad
and
would
say
the
rate
was
good
or
bad,
the
icc
would
not
look
at
the
whole
picture
to
see
--
say
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
conspiracy
which
affected
the
filing
of
these
rates.
so
that
this
court
said
that
this
court
sitting
here
is
the
only
court
that
can
look
at
the
whole
picture
to
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
conspiracy
behind
these
moving
the
railroads
in
filing
their
rates
tothe
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
so
this
court
said
this,
“this
action
will
free
the
rate
making
function
of
the
influences
of
a
conspiracy
over
which
the
commission,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
no
authority,
but
which
he
had
proven
to
exist
can
only
hinder
the
commission
in
the
tasks
with
which
it
is
confronted.”
and
the
court
said,
further
if
--
this
court,
it
will
eliminate
from
ratemaking
the
collusive,
the
practices
which
the
antitrust
laws
condemn
and
which
are
not
sanctioned
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
so
i
say
here,
assuming
that
the
board
had
said
that
this
was
a
proper
subject
to
bargain
and
assuming
the
board
said,
“sign
the
contract,”
in
the
case
it
would
been
negotiated
when
we
refused
to
sign
it.
still,
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
inquire
into
the
broad
subject
to
determine
that
this
identical
clause
affecting
the
lease
of
equipment
was
being
enforced
and
put
as
against
every
carrier
in
the
state
of
ohio.
that's
the
jurisdiction
of
board
wouldn't
have.
so
that
under
your
decision
in
the
southern
rate
making
case,
the
antitrust
laws
are
still
enforceable
by
the
court
because
we
can't
make
the
assumption
that
oliver
is
not
an
independent
contractor.
that
fact
has
been
found
by
the
trial
court.
it's
been
found
by
a
three-judge
appellate
trial
court.
it's
been
confirmed
by
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court.
this
identical
lease
was
at
issue
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
at
about
the
same
time.
in
the
120
nlrb,
150,
identical
lease,
after
the
decision
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oliver
for
some
reason
that
i
do
recall
now
was
not
a
party
to
it.
but
as
a
result
of
this
decision
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
a.c.e
was.
the
identical
lease
that's
in
effect
between
oliver
and
a.c.e
was
at
issue
in
the
nlrb
case.
you
see
after
this
injunction,
the
union
then
decided
to
exercise
the
rights
which
it
had
under
the
law
and
organized
and
seek
a
contract
with
these
employers.
and
in
their
zeal,
instead
of
--
they
say
we
should
--
that
oliver
and
the
owner-operators
should
have
petitioned
for
an
election.
well,
that
right
is
--
they
have
that
right
to
petition
with
the
election,
too.
they
chose
to
strike
the
owner-operators
and
a.c.e
and
they
also
chose
to
strike
a.c.e.
and
so
the
owner-operators,
a
large
group
of
them
and
big
companies
filed
charges
for
the
secondary
boycott
with
the
board.
and
that
the
identical
leases
were
in
effect
and
the
trial
examiner
found
that
these
leases
made
the
lessees
independent
contractors,
the
one
that
was
appealed
to
the
board,
the
board
confirmed
that
position.
so
we
have
--
we've
had
four
people
that
have
examined
the
relationship
between
these
lessors
and
a.c.e,
four
courts,
four
tribunals
and
everyone
of
them
just
said
that
they're
independent
contractors
that
we
can't
beat
them.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i'm
not
making
the
assumption
that
removes
that
from
the
case.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
when
he's
called
a
contractor,
he
was
a
--
he
was
a
separate
employer.
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
each
case,
where
the
union
would
make
a
contract
and
with
--
a
rubber
company
to
determine
the
price
of
tires
or
the
wages
of
their
suppliers
or
that
type
of
thing,
they
wouldn't
call
him
an
independent
contractor
in
the
contract
but
he
was
an
independent
employer.
he
was
an
employer
under
the
act,
that's
--
that's
the
reason.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
because
the
board
has
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
--
i
would
--
well,
assaulting
would
be
a
little
different.
but
i
would
like
to
agree
with
you
on
that
but
following
my
piece
of
though,
i
can't,
that
board
does
not
have
an
antitrust
jurisdiction
whereas
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
probably
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
now
that,
it
was
properly
presented
but
there
was
no
opportunity
to
present
this.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
yes,
we
agreed.
but
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
--
the
fact
that
it
was
accomplished
fact.
as
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
we'd
get
down
to
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
we
get
down
to
the
garner
decisions
and
the
decisions
in
your
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
r.
iden
but
that
was
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
that
was
a
protective
matter
that
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
no,
that
was
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that
was
a
protective
matter
in
protecting
the
right
of
organizations.
that
question
isn't
in
this.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
now,
let
me
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
the
theory
of
the
act
is
to
protect
employees
in
their
right
to
organize
and
in
the
negotiation
for
contracts
and
upon
the
negotiation
of
the
contract,
the
aim
of
the
act
is
to
require
it
to
be
reused
to
writing
and
signed
for
the
parties
that
that
request
was
made.
there
the
act
stops.
the
entire
debate
in
the
congress,
the
decision
to
this
court
have
inclusively
emphasized
that
once
the
contract
was
made
then
it
is
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
courts,
provision
shall
be
enforce
with
the
court.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
they
--
they
could
have
been
sued
in
any
court
with
which
jurisdiction
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
it
could
have
suable
in
federal
court
under
that
section
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
in
--
in
that
case,
the
federal
law
would
apply,
he
could
have
been
sued
in
the
state
court
because
in
the
debate
in
the
house
and
that
debate
is
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
yes.
the
--
the
reason
for
301
in
the
examination
of
the
debate
in
the
house
which
appears
as
a
supplement
in
a
--
to
an
opinion
in
a
recent
case,
that
was
the
--
yes,
textile
worker
--
lincoln
mills,
the
debate
is
largely
there.
originally,
they
provided
that
the
breach
of
a
contract
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
was
taken
out
because
for
the
definite
reason
that
the
suits
for
damages
or
the
enforcement
should
be
in
the
court.
at
one
time,
they
said
it
should
be
--
could
be
brought
in
the
courts
of
any
state
and
in
the
united
state's
courts.
and
the
--
and
the
reference
to
the
states
was
withdrawn
for
this
reason.
why
--
congress
tell
they
could
not
impose
their
will
upon
the
states
because
some
states
you
can't
sue
labor
unions
without
serving
every
individual
union.
that
doesn't
--
in
ohio
we
don't
have
that.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
we
can
sue
an
incorporate
organization
for
suing
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
r.
iden
yes,
it's
right.
and
so
that
--
we're
not
as
familiar
with
that.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
ohio
courts
can
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
--
would
apply
state
law
and
federal
law
where
the
federal
law
had
preempted.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
--
we
certainly
couldn't
interpret
the
state
law
to
the
extent
of
saying
something
with
--
was
unlawful
which
the
congress
had
said
was
lawful.
i
don't
go
that
far
but
certainly
the
forum
would
apply
its
own
procedure
and
its
own
rule.
and
the
reason
that
they
took
out
and
the
state
courts
is
for
the
very
reason
that
in
--
i
think
35
of
the
states,
the
debate
determined
that
--
you
could
bring
the
action
in
a
state
court.
some
of
the
debate
would
--
well,
what
the
federal
court
didn't
act
at
all
because
you
can
sue
it
in
a
state
court
to
get
plenty
of
jurisdiction
historically
there,
bringing
that
action
there,
and
it's
up
to
those
remaining
states
if
they
want
to
get
in
line
so
that
the
action
should
--
can
be
brought
there.
that's
their
problem.
well,
they
--
the
debates
still
went
on.
that
--
and
they
quote
it
from
truman's
report
and
that
all
is
in
there
that
there
should
be
a
remedy.
if
you're
going
to
have
a
contract,
it
should
be
enforceable.
and
so
that
we
are
going
to
--
the
congress
is
going
to
put
some
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
so
that
even
in
those
states
where
you
can't
sue
in
the
state
courts,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
go
the
federal
court
without
worrying
about
the
jurisdictional
amount
or
citizenship.
and
they
--
so
that
there's
no
question
if
congress
intended
that
these
contracts
be
enforced
in
this
--
in
the
courts
where
the
broad
picture
could
be
had.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
that
this
case
was
tried
as
an
antitrust
case
and
as
an
antitrust
case
it
can
be
enforced
in
the
state
or
federal
courts
depending
which
anti
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
allen
bradley
and
in
gibbony,
the
whole
line
of
antitrust
cases.
i
have
discussed
norris-laguardia
not
directly
but
in
my
section
of
my
brief
in
the
application
of
the
antitrust
statutes
on
page
31.
i
see
that
i've
mentioned
the
act,
i
had
it
in
my
mind,
and
i
went
on
to
cite
allen
bradley
where
a
union
contract
was
held
to
violate
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
certainly
a
tribunal
not
the
board
interpreted
that
contract
and
this
court
said
they
have
the
authority.
then
in
the
gibbony
case,
the
state
courts
of
missouri
interpreted
the
state
--
a
union
contract
that
held
what
was
contrary
to
missouri
antitrust
laws
and
this
court
affirmed
it.
i
like
to
refer
this
court
to
one
case
that
i
think
says
--
gives
my
argument
better
than
i
can
and
that's
the
massachusetts
case
of
commonwealth
versus
mccue.
the
decision
obviously
is
not
binding
upon
this
court.
it
wasn't
binding
upon
the
courts
of
ohio.
but
that
was
the
basis
where
the
decision
in
the
court
of
ohio
is
in
the
mccue
case.
in
that
case,
the
state
court
told
that
certain
activities
violated
the
massachusetts
antitrust
laws
and
then
they
arrested
the
union
leaders
and
tried
them
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws
and
found
them
guilty.
that
--
it
--
if
this
court
would
read
common
law
versus
the
mccue
cited
in
my
brief
and
if
they
can
find
that
that
court
was
right,
then
it
will
have
to
find
that
the
courts
in
the
state
of
ohio
were
right.
every
issue
was
in
there.
every
argument
made
and
fought
bitterly.
in
that
case
they
even
removed
it
to
the
federal
courts,
and
the
federal
court
remanded
it
back.
they
used
every
device
in
that
case
to
test
jurisdiction.
i
would
entirely
rely
in
my
case
on
that
massachusetts'
decision
to
commonwealth
versus
mccue.
that
was
--
in
that
case
the
state
was
the
plaintiff.
there
was
the
common
pleas
decision
in
ohio
in
which
the
same
statute
was
enforced
that
the
--
an
action
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
so
that
the
state
can
bring
antitrust
actions
against
unions.
but
in
my
section
on
page
31
on
the
antitrust
statute
this
is
a
question
that
the
courts
had
the
jurisdiction
to
interpret
the
statutes.
now,
where
are
we
going
to
get
if
that
isn't
the
law?
last
week,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
held
that
the
union
contracts
providing
for
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
was
contrary
to
the
statutes
of
ohio
with
respect
to
unemployment
compensation.
well,
certainly
are
we
going
to
close
every
contract
that
the
union
makes
with
a
complete
immunity
from
scrutiny?
could
the
--
the
antitrust
divisions
of
the
government
is
always
looking
down
their
nose
if
the
rubber
companies
enacting
for
their
pricing
method.
now,
if
we're
taking
the
argument
that
only
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
even
view
and
review
a
union
contract,
all
we
have
to
do
to
get
around
any
law
is
to
have
the
union
sign
the
contract
fixing
the
price
of
tires
with
the
company.
certainly
the
price
of
tires
affects
the
ability
to
cut,
i
mean,
to
pay
wages
to
their
employees.
and
so
if
the
rubber
workers
can
make
a
contract
with
goodyear
fixing
the
price
of
their
tires
and
then
go
to
the
goodrich
and
fix
with
identical
price
with
goodrich
tires
and
for
firestone,
and
if
this
court
or
any
other
court
would
say,
“well,
you
can't
inquire
in,
i'll
bring
your
prosecution
on
the
antitrust
laws
nor
can
you
easily
inquire
into
it
because
the
union
is
a
part
of
that
contract,”
where
are
we
going?
once
the
contract
is
negotiated,
the
functions
of
the
board
has
ceased.
there's
no
way
to
go
there.
there
is
no
provision
in
which
the
board
can
review
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
it's
only
left
to
the
courts
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
--
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
all
this
antitrust
cases.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
neither
of
them
were
competing.
certainly,
there's
500
carriers
in
equity.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
in
my
view,
this
is
an
antitrust
case.
this
is
not
a
labor
case.
this
is
an
antitrust
case
and
the
view
of
the
court
in
my
opinion
while
they
don't
--
without
question
the
court
was
taking
into
consideration
that
it
violated
the
prior
existing
contract.
but
it
also
was
an
antitrust
case
that
in
my
view
of
it
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
--
it
was
primarily
an
antitrust
case.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
contract
was
enjoined
before
we
signed
it
then
the
court
from
the
journal
entry
authorizing
the
provisions
of
the
contract
to
be
signed,
saved,
article
32
would
not
be
effective.
so
then
we
signed
it.
but
we
had
not
signed
it
until
the
court
authorized
it
to
be
signed
freed
of
article
32.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
action
was
brought,
an
injunction
was
granted
against
signing
the
contract.
we
did
not
sign
it
because
we
were
enjoined
and
then
--
there
was
a
motion
made
and
the
contracts
had
with
the
court
and
the
court
put
--
signed
an
entry
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
which
it
authorized
the
contract
to
be
signed
by
our
--
by
our
clients
and
the
carrier.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
the
union
contract.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
and
it
saved
--
and
except
article
32.
so
the
entire
contract
became
then
effective.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
think
the
evidence
showed
that
we
have
negotiated
it
with
--
by
our
agents
and
the
--
under
the
law
once
the
contract
--
we
couldn't
--
we
knew
we
couldn't
refute
the
authority
of
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
but
for
the
restraining
order,
we
wouldn't
have
signed.
that's
in
the
record,
no
question
about
it.
this
journal
entry
i
was
referring
to
appears
on
page
14
of
the
record
in
which
the
contract
--
the
party
--
carriers
were
authorized
to
sign
it.
originally
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
and
the
union.
after
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
what?
mr.
charles
r.
iden
no,
that
was
--
it
was
a
contract
--
the
labor
contract
between
the
union
and
the
carriers.
it's
signed
by
every
carrier
in
the
state.
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
yes,
which
was
--
mostly
the
same.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
well,
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
yes,
it's
saved
--
it's
saved
article
32.
so
that
the
labor
contract
portion
of
it
which
have
affected
our
employees
was
in
effect.
the
--
the
federal
court
in
c.l.
mead
versus
teamsters,
230
f.2d
576
was
not
in
my
brief.
there
was
a
strike
contrary
to
this
union
contract
in
effect
between
the
teamsters
and
the
c.l.
mead
and
they
had
a
strike
and
the
carriers
sued
the
teamsters
for
breach
of
contract
and
that
case
in
the
federal
court.
and
the
--
in
that
case
it
was
held
that
the
action
would
lie.
well,
certainly
whatever
you're
suing
for
damages
under
any
contract,
union
or
otherwise
there's
certainly
a
requirement
that
the
court
look
at
the
contract
and
interpret
it
to
see
whether
there's
a
--
the
plaintiff
show
this
to
the
defendant.
this
certainly
--
implicit
in
all
these
cases
is
the
fact
that
courts
can
interpret
these
contracts.
but
i
say
allen
bradley
is
the
leading
case,
you
got
gibbony
which
is
the
reverse
that
the
state
antitrust
laws
can
be
enforced.
we
got
the
plasterers
case.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
by
the
--
no,
it
was
not
a
picketing
case.
if
you
start
getting
strike,
then
you
get
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
oh,
the
allen
bradley
knows
the
combination
between
the
electrical
contractors
and
electrical
unions
and
new
york
provided
that
the
contractors
wouldn't
purchase
any
electrical
equipment
by
what
was
manufactured
by
the
unions
in
new
york
then
effectively
cut
everybody
else
out
of
the
electrical
field
in
new
york
city
and
the
--
this
court
held
that
was
contrary
to
antitrust
laws
and
certainly
you
permitted
some
court
to
interpret
and
interfere
with
the
union
contract
and
it
wasn't
the
board.
and
the
same
thing
happened
in
gibbony.
there's
no
strike
there.
they
thought
about
a
strike
here.
no
question
about
it.
it's
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
there
was
no
strike.
the
plasterers
case
was
a
similar
combination
between
the
plastering
contractors
and
the
unions
in
chicago.
these
are
antitrust
cases.
the
massachusetts
fisheries
case
was
an
antitrust
case
which
arose
--
the
facts
are
identical
other
than
in
the
case,
when
we're
talking
about
boats
and
fish,
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
trucks
and
freight.
it
was
the
same
combination.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
this
case
was
tried
in
theory
that
the
--
that
the
union
contract
so
far
as
in
my
opinion
affected
all
of
his
equipments
and
certainly
affected
of
all,
he
was
driving
it.
well,
he
was
driving
it
that
it
gets
within
the
contract
and
he
did
drive
it.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
and
that
he
--
that
was
the
theory
it
was
tried
on.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
he
assumed
the
right
and
did
drive
any
truck
indiscriminately.
so
that
certainly
the
--
this
contract
would
--
and
the
union's
view
would
have
been
effective
while
he
was
driving
this
--
this
--
the
little
truck
he
was
driving.
so,
that
i
would
say
that
while
he
is
driving
a
truck
and
as
long
he
assumes
that
right
then
as
to
those
trucks
that
those
days
then
this
contract
that
the
union
attempted
to
put
in
would
have
been
effective
had
it
been
signed
in
but
for
the
injunction.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
we
should
be
pleased
to
do
so
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
within
the
limitations
established
by
the
court.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
on
the
time
limitation.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
think
we
can
have
it
here
within
10
days,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
seven
days.
i
assume
that
you
would
prefer
to
have
it
printed,
that
--
that
would
be
the
only
problem,
printing
it.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
have
it
here
in
five
days.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
would
you
want
simultaneous
memos
or
you
want
to
chance
to
reply
to
each
other?
it
makes
no
difference
to
me.
well,
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
if
our
--
if
our
reports,
we'll
put
a
memo
in,
i'm
sure
we
will
exercise
the
same
prerogative.
this
is
--
we
don't
give
a
quarter
in
this
case.
we
have
to
get
--
we're
not
starting.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
there's
a
--
there's
a
weekend
intervening,
i've
been
in
washington
for
--
since
monday
and
[laughs]
--
mr.
charles
r.
iden
i
think
that
that
refers
only
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
with
the
matter
of
litigated
in
the
court,
i
believe
that's
the
answer
to
it.
mr.
charles
r.
iden
we
will
have
it
right
here
about
monday
morning
your
honor.
our
position
