mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
we
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
cases
are
involved.
the
statute
tells
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
statute
itself
has
expired.
the
applications
had
been
made
before
december
1955.
we
do
know
that
under
this
statute,
about
40,000
aliens
were
naturalized.
mr.
john
f.
davis
had
been.
well,
none
can
be
now.
i
mean
the
applications
had
to
be
filed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes,
i
would
--
i
wouldn't
think
that
we
would
--
there'd
be
any
volume
of
litigation
in
this
matter
now.
i
would
think
it
was
--
there's
enough
time
that's
passed
since
the
application
from
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
so
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
--
there
has
been
--
in
new
york,
there's
been
a
series
of
these
cases
under
this
statute.
i
--
i
know
of
no
others.
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
there'd
be
any
or
not.
there
might
be
some
applications
to
--
to
terminate
naturalization
on
--
on
the
ground
that
it
was
improperly
granted
but
i
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
but
i
--
i
think
it
is
not
a
large
problem
as
far
as
volume
of
--
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
very
important
to
the
fellow.
and
we
must
remember
in
these
cases
that
we're
dealing
not
only
with
1440
(a)
of
the
--
of
title
8,
but
we
are
dealing
with
an
individual,
an
individual
chinese
who
--
whose
interests
are
very
really
at
stake
in
this
case.
but
we
also
must
realize
that
congress
has
set
a
policy
on
what
people
can
come
in,
and
we
shouldn't
necessarily
give
--
if
--
if
the
man
comes
in
illegally,
we
are
not
really
doing
any
good
by
--
by
giving
him
rights,
which
we
don't
give
to
people
who
wait
patiently
for
their
term
to
come
in
and
wait
under
the
quarter.
so
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
i
have
no
--
i
have
no
idea
that
any
of
them
are
wrong.
i
mean
as
far
as
i
know,
those
are
--
those
are
properly
granted.
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
that
they
would
be
thrown
out
on
this
case.i
don't
say
that
there
were
40,000
people
who
came
in
illegally
and
were
naturalized.
i'm
--
i'm
just
merely
saying
that
there
were
40,000
aliens.
and
undoubtedly,
only
a
handful
of
cases,
if
any,
that
there
--
where
we
would
claim
that
there
was
anything
improper
about
the
grant.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
--
none.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
know
of
none.
that's
the
total
number
of
cases
of
naturalization
under
the
statute.
on
the
facts,
i
think
it
first
should
be
made
clear
that
the
entry
in
honolulu
was
purely
a
temporary
grant
to
a
seaman
to
come
on
shore
while
his
ship
was
in
port.
there
was
no
formal
approval
of
his
character,
no
right
to
stay,
merely
a
right
to
land,
to
walk
around
in
--
in
honolulu
while
the
ship
was
in
port.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
we'd
have
a
much
more
difficult
case
under
this
statute,
then
there
would
have
been
a
legal
entry
and
a
physical
presence
in
the
term
of
the
statute
which
would
have
been
connected.
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
he
hadn't
fulfilled
the
terms
of
the
statute,
although
the
sponsors
of
the
statute
stated
to
the
--
to
the
congress
that
he
must
be
here
lawfully,
not
only
that
he
would
have
to
be
here
physically
but
here
lawfully.
but
under
the
words
of
the
statute
as
enacted,
if
he
came
in
lawfully
and
physically
stayed
after
that
lawful,
overstayed
his
leave,
in
other
words,
we'd
have
a
much
more
difficult
case.
what
happened
in
this
case,
however,
was
that
he
left
the
country
entirely
and
his
landing
at
newport
news,
had
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
coming
ashore
in
honolulu.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
that
--
that
would
be
an
entry
into
the
united
states
under
the
statute.
there
isn't
really,
i
think,
any
dispute
between
mr.
mahoney
and
myself,
any
dispute
which
has
any
legal
significance
as
to
the
terms
of
his
landing
at
newport
news.
mr.
mahoney
claims
that
the
alien
had
permission
from
an
official,
and
this
is
based
on
his
testimony
in
the
immigration
proceeding,
he
had
permission
from
an
officer
on
the
ship
to
land,
and
that
taking
this
as
permission
he
came
ashore
and
went
to
new
york.
this
would
not
make
his
entry
legal.
he
had
no
landing
permit
from
the
immigration
people.
he
had
no
other
permit
from
the
immigration
people.
and
if
we
accept
what
mr.
mahoney
says
in
full,
his
entry
was
still
without
--
outside
of
the
law.
it
may
have
to
do
with
his
--
based
whether
or
not
he
was
trying
to
stay
here,
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
he
legally
came
into
the
country.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
is
given
--
he
is
given
an
actual
piece
of
paper,
a
landing
permit
which
is
given
by
the
immigration
authorities
who
go
on
board
the
ship
when
it
comes
in.
and
unless
he
has
this
landing
permit,
he
is
not
--
he
--
he
has
no
right
to
come
ashore
at
all.
he
has
no
right
to
leave
the
ship.
now,
this
landing
permit
is
given
by
the
immigration
authorities
to
bona
fide
seaman.
it's
part
of
the
part
--
it
is
considered
part
of
the
policy
of
the
immigration
law
that
--
that
these
people
should
be
permitted
to
get
ashore
and
stretch
their
legs
if
they
are
bona
fide
seaman
and
if
you
believe
that
they
are
going
to
get
back
on
the
vessel
and
sail
when
it
sails.
actually,
they
imposed
quite
a
penalty
on
the
ship
when
they
don't
return
to
it,
so
they
try
to
get
the
--
the
owners
of
the
ship
to
help
enforce
the
law.
but
if
the
man
is
a
bona
fide
seaman
and
they
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
going
to
do
damage
in
the
united
states,
this
little
--
the
man
at
the
dock
will
give
the
seaman
this
landing
permit.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
has
been
so
held
that
it
is
an
entry.
it
generally
comes
up
in
the
case
of
a
man
overstaying
his
leave
and
the
question
is
does
he
enter
illegally
and
it's
been
held
he
doesn't
enter
illegally
but
he
overstays
his
leave
and
can
be
thrown
out
on
that
ground.
now,
historically,
congress
has,
for
a
long
time,
given
special
privileges
with
respect
to
naturalization
to
aliens
who
have
served
in
the
--
in
the
armed
forces.
and
how
much
benefit
they
have
given
has
differed
from
time
to
time.
during
the
civil
war,
they
--
in
--
i
think
in
1862,
the
first
of
these
statutes
was
passed
which
cut
down
the
period
of
required
residence
from
five
years
to
one
year.
that
was
the
only
--
the
benefit
that
was
given.
they
gave
privileges
for
expediting
naturalization
in
world
war
i
and
again
in
world
war
ii.
and
there
are
several
reasons,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
--
to
understand
these
reasons
for
giving
this
right
which
is
largely
a
right
to
expedite
naturalization.
one
of
the
reasons
is
that,
and
this
is
particularly
applicable
when
--
when
soldiers
are
going
overseas,
that
if
a
--
american
member
of
the
armed
forces
is
captured
overseas,
it's
particularly
important
that
that
man
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
so
that
he
will
be
entitled
to
all
of
the
--
the
rights
and
the
protections
of
being
a
citizen,
so
--
so
to
speak,
of
the
united
states.
a
second
reason
that
they
expedite
naturalization
is
in
order
to
make
available
to
the
armed
forces
in
--
as
officers
as
well
as
anything
else,
people
who
would
otherwise
be
aliens.
you
sometimes
get
a
situation
where
you
have,
and
we
had
it
in
world
war
ii,
where
you
have
people
who
had
military
training
and
could
be
useful
to
the
government
in
--
in
--
as
officers,
but
in
order
to
be
an
officer,
one
must
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
this
is
a
second
reason
referred
to
by
congress
for
expediting
naturalization.
and
the
third
reason
is,
of
course,
to
add
another
incentive
to
people
being
--
joining
the
armed
force.
it's
a
--
it's
an
advantage
which
they
get
and
it
--
it
aids
in
recruitment,
it
gives
them
a
benefit
for
--
for
service
which
they
have
performed
for
the
united
states.
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
background
which
congress
considered
this
act
in
1953.
they
had
tried
to
pass
an
act
in
1952
but
there
was
a
difference
between
the
house
and
the
senate
as
to
the
terms
of
the
act.
the
house
had
wanted
to
grant
the
--
the
privilege
of
naturalization
to
those
who
had
come
in
temporarily
and
had
joined
the
armed
forces,
while
the
senate,
largely
on
the
--
on
the
pressure
from
senator
mccarran
felt
that
the
man
would
have
had
to
have
been
admitted
for
permanent
residence
before
he
should
be
given
the
privilege
of
the
expeditious
naturalization.
because
of
this
difference,
the
legislation
failed
in
1952.
this
was
a
serious
thing
because
at
this
time,
the
conflict
in
korea
was
going
on.
we
had
soldiers
there.
and
in
1953,
it
became
apparent
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
two
houses
to
get
together
and
they
did
pass
this
bill,
which
we
have
before
us
and
which
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
and
it
does
grant
the
right
of
expeditious
naturalization
not
only
to
those
who
have
been
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
but
it
also
granted
the
right
to
those
who
had
been
lawfully
admitted
under
any
circumstances,
provided
they
spent
--
were
physically
present
for
one
year
at
the
time
that
they
entered
the
armed
forces.
this
relaxed
the
existing
immigration
law
which
required
one
that
there'd
be
admission
for
permanent
residence
and
two
that
there'd
be
a
five-year
resident
--
five-year
residence.
in
both
of
these
respects,
it
was
relaxed
by
this
new
law.
now,
we
believe
that
a
reasonable
construction
of
this
statute
means
that
there
must
be
a
relationship,
that
there
was
intended
to
be
a
relationship
between
the
lawful
admission
and
the
physical
presence.
we
base
this
on
two
--
on
three
--
on
three
factors,
one,
the
natural
reading
of
the
--
of
the
statute
and
the
structure
of
--
of
the
entire
naturalization
act
and
two,
on
the
legislative
history
and
three,
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
bonetti
case.
if
we
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute
alone,
we
find
that
there
are
stated
in
conjunction,
the
two
conditions
having
been
lawfully
admitted
to
the
united
states
and
having
been
physically
present
within
the
united
states
for
a
single
period
of
at
least
one
year.
it
seems
to
us
that
those
two
terms
are
reasonably
read
conjunctively.
and
this
is
particularly
so
when
it
appears
that
congress
could
have
had
no
--
there
is
no
apparent
purpose
in
giving
any
recognition
to
a
lawful
admission
for
temporary
--
temporary
admission
only
which
has
been
passed.
at
no
place
in
the
present
immigration
law,
not
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
any
of
the
past
immigration
laws,
is
any
status
given
because
of
the
fact
that
a
person
has
been
lawfully
admitted
for
temporary
period
and
then
left.
i
mean
if
he
leaves,
he
gives
up
whatever
privileges
he
has.
and
i
find
no
place
anywhere
in
the
law
where
congress
has
said
that
this
gives
him
any
advantage
and
indeed,
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
--
i
--
i
think
some
light
is
given
on
that
by
the
reason
for
putting
in
the
one
year
physical
presence
which
would
indicate
that
it
had
to
be
a
year
after
the
lawful
entry
rather
than
a
year
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
the
year
has
to
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
the
term
of
the
statute
is
--
and
having
been
physically
present
within
the
united
states
for
a
single
period
of
at
least
one
year
at
the
time
of
entering
the
armed
forces.
mr.
john
f.
davis
at
the
time
of
entering
the
service?
mr.
john
f.
davis
at
the
time
of
entering
the
service?
you
would
have
been
here
a
year
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
there
is
one
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
--
there
is
one
case
which
--
which
puts
such
a
construction
on
this,
one
district
court
case.
i
suggest,
however,
that
what
congress
put
in
the
year
period
because
of
a
term
in
the
selective
service
act
which
says
that
an
alien
who
was
only
temporarily
resident
here
maybe
called
on
for
service
if
he
is
physically
present
here
for
a
year.
if
an
--
if
an
alien
is
here
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
it
--
i
think
this
means
at
the
time
he
is
called
on
for
service.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right,
although
i
think
that
the
armed
--
that
the
selective
service
act
doesn't
say
a
single
period
and
it's
possible
that
under
the
selective
--
this
don't
exactly
match.
under
the
selective
service
act,
it
may
be
that
it
could
be
interrupted
by
a
trip
back
home,
whereas
this
is
a
single
period.but
that's
--
the
senate
--
the
senate
which
put
this
one
year
physical
presence
into
the
bill
said
they
did
this
in
order
to
have
this
act
working
with
the
selective
service
act.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
means
that
it
should
be
year
at
the
time
of
induction.
otherwise,
you
don't
get
this
interest
which
the
alien
has
in
here.
he
is
--
he
is
only
a
visitor.
he
hasn't
got
--
there
isn't
any
reason
to
call
upon
him,
no
relationship
to
the
country
which
would
lead
you
to
call
upon
him
to
--
to
go
into
the
armed
services.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
i
think
he
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
that
is
not
--
we
have
in
fact
cases
only
useful
for
analysis
on
our
case.
it's
not
our
case,
of
course.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
would
say
that
he
had
to
be
here
one
year
just
preceding
his
induction.
that's
why
i
would
read
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
addition
to
the
--
to
the
structure
and
the
language
of
the
act,
the
congressman
who
was
sponsoring
the
act
in
the
house,
chairman
of
the
--
of
the
house
committee
on
inquiry
from
congressman
walter
specifically
stated
that
this
bill
was
supposed
to
grant
citizenship
to
those
who
were
lawfully
in
the
united
states.
this
seems
to
me
to
--
to
give
support
to
the
--
to
the
--
what
i
would
say
was
the
natural
reading
of
the
--
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that
appears
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
page
14.
congressman
walter,
“is
this
not
the
bill
that
is
identical
with
the
law
as
it
existed
during
the
war
with
the
exception
that
it
applied
only
to
aliens
who
are
legally
and
lawfully
in
the
united
states?”
and
congressman
graham,
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
committee
replied,
i
am
reading
from
page
14,
“that
is
a
correct
statement.”
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
i
--
i
agree
that
if
we
were
going
to
have
to
try
to
--
to
try
to
change
the
language
of
the
statute
by
what
was
said,
but
this
indicates
rather
a
--
a
feeling
on
the
part
and
it's
the
same
thing
--
it's
true
in
the
senate
that
they
weren't
doing
anything
as
violent
as
suggested
on
the
other
side
to
grant
citizenship
to
those
who
were
here
illegally.
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
the
--
the
reason
that
i
stated,
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
stated
in
--
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
senate
did
put
it
in.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
yes,
they
did
give
reasons.
they
stated
the
reason
they
put
it
in
was
that
an
alien
is
not
subject
to
induction
under
the
selective
service
act
unless
he
has
been
here
for
a
year.
he's
--
he
has
to
register
after
he
has
been
here
six
months,
but
he
cannot
be
called
up
for
service
and
that
he
has
been
here
for
a
year.
and
they
wanted
to
tie
in
the
provision
for
granting
citizenship
with
a
provision
of
the
selective
service
act
requiring
military
service.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
i
wonder
if
i
have
the
language
of
it
here.
this
is
--
i
am
reading
--
this
is
from
the
selective
service
act
of
1948.
i
don't
have
the
code
citation
to
it
but
it's
the
present
act,
"provided
further
that
any
male
alien
who
is
between
the
age
of
18
years
and
six
months
and
26
years
at
the
time
of
registration
or
attains
the
age
after
being
registered
who
has
remained
in
the
united
states
in
a
status
other
than
that
of
a
permanent
resident
for
a
period
exceeding
one
year."
i
am
not
sure
that's
much
--
much
more
definite
than
--
than
the
naturalization
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
says
"provided
further
that
any
male
alien
who
is
between
the
age
of,"
so
and
so
and
so
and
so,
"who
has
remained
in
the
united
states
in
a
status
other
than
that
of
a
permanent
resident
for
a
period
exceeding
one
year
shall
be
liable
for
training
and
service."
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
makes
--
they
feel
is
different.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
may
--
may
i
comment
on
that?
mr.
john
f.
davis
with
respect
senator
lehman's
position,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
16
of
our
brief,
senator
lehman
was
not
urging
that
those
who
were
here
unlawfully
should
be
given
the
privilege
of
expeditious
naturalization.
he
was
trying
to
get
the
same
treatment
given
in
the
senate
that
was
given
in
the
house
to
give
those
who
were
not
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
the
--
the
law
at
that
time
required
permanent
residence.
the
house
was
going
to
relax
this
to
permit
those
who
were
admitted
for
temporary
residences
as
well
as
permanent
residence.
senator
mccarran
wouldn't
go
along
with
it.
senator
lehman
wasn't
talking
about
those
who
were
here
illegally,
but
he
was
talking
about
those
who
had
been
admitted
only
temporarily.
and
so
that,
we
don't
find
any
--
any
senator
who
was
urging
that
those
who
were
here
illegally
should
be
granted
naturalization
in
either
house.
there
is
no
word
of
debate
in
either
house
that
those
were
here
illegally
--
who
have
entered
illegally
should
be
granted
this
thing.
then
when
the
department
of
justice
made
its
recommendation
to
both
houses,
it
was
dealing
with
a
bill
which
did
not
have
the
provision
for
one
year's
physical
presence
in
it.
they
were
dealing
with
a
separate
--
with
a
different
bill,
and
i
believe
that
there,
the
judgment
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
that
different
bill
since
i
think
they
have
--
would
--
would
not
have
been
made,
wouldn't
have
the
same
connotation
if
they
had
had
this
one
year's
physical
presence
which
we
are
now
concerned
with.
now,
the
--
the
decision
of
this
court
last
term
in
--
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
was
--
he
was
referring,
as
i
say,
to
the
bill
before
it
was
amended
to
put
in
the
one
year
of
physical
presence.
he
was
dealing
with
the
bill
which
merely
said,
"legally
admitted".
so
that
his
--
the
--
the
attorney
general's
suggestions
really
have
no
reference.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
his
own
suggestion
he
said
this
bill
is
supposed
to
grant
naturalization
to
those
who
are
legally
in
the
united
states.
that
term
is
--
is
included
in
this
letter.
but
he
was
dealing
with
a
situation
where
there
was
no
period
for
one
year's
physical
presence.
and
he
said
that
the
--
they
didn't
need
to
exempt
these
aliens
from
their
requirement
of
proving
a
continuation
of
their
legal
--
of
their
legal
entry.
then
the
senate
changed
the
bill
to
put
in
a
provision
for
physical
presence
for
one
year
and
that
--
that
makes
the
change
which,
i
think,
cuts
--
cuts
the
ground
out
from
any
--
any
reason
for
--
for
putting
in
what
the
attorney
general
had
suggested.
the
--
changes
of
the
situation,
how
much
it
changes
it?
i
don't
know.
now,
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
was
in
the
--
it
was
in
the
committee
report.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
they
did
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
they
accepted
--
they
accepted
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
--
the
reason
that
--
one
reason
they
wanted
that
year
in
was
to
prevent
someone
from
getting
a
quick
naturalization
by
coming
in,
getting
a
temporary
entry
and
going
into
the
armed
service
whether
he
was
subject
to
the
--
to
the
selective
service
act
or
not.
they
wanted
to
tie
this
in
with
the
selective
service
provision.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
may
not
even
above
the
state,
he
may
still
have
been
here.
he
may
--
he
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
would
cover
the
period,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
could
have
been
lawful
or
unlawfully.
it
wouldn't,
under
the
act
as
passed
by
the
senate,
in
either
case.
he
had
to
be
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
i
believe
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
believe
that
the
army
took
the
men
only
through
the
selective
service
system
and
the
way
he
would
come
in,
would
come
in
and
register
with
the
selective
service.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
army
did
not
accept
enlistments
from
aliens.
i
may
be
wrong
on
that,
but
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
there
is
at
present.
it
was
--
this
is
a
little
complicated.
during
world
war
ii,
there
was
a
provision
in
order
to
take
care
of
aliens
who
were
serving
abroad
and
that
provision
gave
them
a
right
to
be
naturalized
and
also
naturalized
in
the
field
whether
or
not
they
came
in
legally
at
all.
this
was
specific
in
the
statute.
it
wasn't
in
--
i
think
enacted
in
1944.
the
1942
act
wasn't
--
they
didn't
feel
--
gave
enough
protection.
in
1944,
they
amended
it
so
that
he
could
be
naturalized
from
the
field.
now,
present
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he
had
to
be
in
this
country.
he
had
to
--
he
had
to
enter
the
service
while
he
was
in
this
country
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
under
that
provision.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
under
this
provision.
he
could
get
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he
--
they
couldn't.
although
if
they
thereafter
were
legally
admitted
to
the
united
states,
then
that
service
would
give
them
--
would
take
the
place
of
--
of
residence
here.
but
in
order
to
complete
the
--
that
--
that
question,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
present
provision
of
8
u.s.c.
1440
which
provide
for
those
who
didn't
actually
get
naturalized
during
world
war
i
or
world
war
ii.
and
for
some
reason,
and
i
don't
know
why
this
is,
in
about
1948,
congress
passed
the
provision
saying
that
they
too
could
be
naturalized
whether
or
not
they
entered
legally.
so,
presently,
on
our
books,
we
have
a
provision
for
naturalization
of
aliens
who
came
in,
actually
came
in
illegally.
this
is
--
this
is
specific
by
--
by
the
specific
provision.
mr.
john
f.
davis
1440.
it's
the
section
in
--
in
the
u.s.
code
which
immediately
precedes
this
one
dealing
with
the
korean
war.
this
was
not
the
term
--
these
were
not
the
terms
of
the
statutes
during
the
war,
these
were
something
that
was
passed
later
on,
and
as
i
say,
i
think,
in
1948.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
believe
--
i
--
i
checked
with
the
selective
service
on
this
and
i
was
told
by
the
selective
service
that
they
--
the
only
way
they
took
aliens
into
the
army
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
i
didn't
check
on
the
navy,
but
the
only
way
they
took
it
into
the
army
was
through
the
selective
service
system
itself.
just
one
more
word
and
that
is
i
wanted
to
say
that
--
that
this
court
shouldn't
get
the
impression
that
this
particular
petitioner
was
dragged
into
the
army
against
his
will
and
made
to
serve
in
the
army.
he
had
an
exemption
from
service,
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
claim
his
exemption
as
an
alien
and
he
could
have
been
accepted
immediately
from
service,
and
he
didn't
go
in
there
with
any
--
under
any
contract
implied
or
any
otherwise
that
he
could
get
citizenship.
this
particular
statute
was
not
on
the
books
at
the
time
he
was
inducted
into
the
service.
so,
there
is
no
--
he
went
in
then.
there's
no
misconception.
there
wasn't
any
law
which
gave
him
any
right
at
the
time
he
was
inducted.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
it
does
redound
to
his
credit
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
but
i
think
that
it
shows
that
there
was
no
obligation
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
no
--
no
type
of
--
of
holding
out
to
him
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
on
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
had
been
a
good
many
special
bills
with
respect
to
deportation
on
an
entry
into
the
country.
i
don't
know
about
granting
naturalization
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
although
i
must
--
i
must,
in
order
to
be
frank,
say
that
the
naturalization
and
the
deportation
probably
go
hand
in
hand
in
this
case.
and
that
if
the
man
is
not
given
citizenship,
he
will
be
subject
to
deportation.
and
--
and
in
that
case,
frequently,
you
get
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
and
in
order
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
of
course.
and
in
order
--
and
in
order
to
cut
down,
however,
on
special
legislation
on
deportation,
they
have
given
authority,
of
course,
to
the
--
to
the
department
of
justice
to
suspend
deportation
when
a
man
meets
the
requirements
of
--
of
the
act
and
then
the
--
a
report
is
made
to
congress
and
congress
either
reaffirms
or
--
or
lets
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
under
the
present
law,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
his
--
well,
so
far
as
i
know,
he
has
no
dependence
for
one
thing.
for
another
thing,
he
didn't
have
--
come
in
legally,
and
when
he
doesn't
come
in
legally,
he
has
to
have
10
years
residence
before
it's
a
suspendable
case.
and
i
think
there
are
other
reasons,
but
i
think
it
is
not
at
present
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
came
from
tianjin
originally.
that's
where
he
was
born.
he
signed
on
this
vessel
from
hong
kong.
and
in
the
proceedings,
he
has
indicated
a
desire
--
some
of
the
deportation
proceedings
show
that
he
would
go
back
to
formosa.
