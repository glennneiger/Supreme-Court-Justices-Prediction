chief

we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mahoney,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
there
--
and
this
has
a
rather
long
legislative
history
that
goes
back
into
a
previous
session
of
the
senate.
and
at
that
time,
congressman
walter
made
it
plain
that
he
not
--
that
it
was
to
apply
only
to
those
who
were
lawfully
in
the
united
states
at
that
time.
and
senator
lehman
objected
to
the
word
"lawful"
and
said
that
aliens
who
enter
the
service
should
be
entitled
to
this
relief
even
though
they
were
--
were
not
lawfully
and
at
the
time
they
didn't
pass
that
time,
then
congressman
graham
introduced
his
bill
4233
and
said,
as
you
have
stated
that
it
applied
only
to
aliens
who
are
legally
and
lawfully
in
the
united
states
and
at
the
same
time,
the
--
the
department
of
justice
tried
to
make
that
very
plain
by
having
them
insert
"who
have
been
lawfully
admitted
to
the
united
states,
who
shall
have
been,
at
the
time
of
entering
the
armed
forces,
lawfully
within
such
area."
but
that
was
rejected.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
not
put
in
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
left
it
in
this
--
this
rather
nebulous
state
that
it
is
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
was
the
significance
of
the
letter
that
the
deputy
attorney
general
tried
to
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
that's
--
if
that's
of
any
importance
at
all,
shouldn't
it
redound
to
his
credit
rather
than
against
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
