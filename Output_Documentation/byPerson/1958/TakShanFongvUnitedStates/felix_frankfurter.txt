justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
one
thing
is
clear
that
mere
service
in
the
army
and
honorable
discharge,
that
alone
isn't
sufficient
to
be
--
get
naturalization.
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
congress
did
want
something
in
addition
to
the
great
service
that
a
man
does
by
joining
the
army
when
he
can
--
thought
of
it
and
serving
it
faithfully
and
honorably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
--
that
citizenship,
the
right
to
citizenship
isn't
--
isn't
wholly
correct
to
say
but
that's
the
reward
for
serving
uncle
sam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
i'm
--
i'm
pointing
out
that
there
isn't
that
equation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mahoney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
none
of
these
facts
are
true,
that
we
--
we
may
have
cases
where
not
one
of
those
facts
that
you've
just
recited
happened
or
took
place,
and
yet,
the
problem
would
be
exactly
the
same.
you
--
you
--
these
facts
indicate
hardship
and
--
are
appealing.
but
they
seem
to
me
just
as
irrelevant
as
the
--
to
the
issue
as
mr.
justice
whittaker's
hard
case
put
to
you
of
a
child
coming
here
--
firstly,
coming
here
as
a
child
and
then
leaving
and
then
smuggling
himself
in
and
then
serving,
isn't
that
true?
you
said
quite
correctly.
from
my
point
of
view,
it
makes
no
difference
from
yours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
these
--
these
merciful
elements
that
you
just
narrated
are
equally
indifferent
to
the
problem,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
to
point
up
--
point
up
the
hardship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
justice
whittaker's
case
also
points
up
the
--
the
[laughs]
non-appeal
in
the
other
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
launch
into
your
argument,
i
haven't
looked
at
the
brief,
you
may
have
told
me
there
the
act.
do
we
know
that
the
problem
is
approximately
how
many
potential
cases
of
this
sort
are
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
would
move
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
potentially
i
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
been
already.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
may
not
have
come
up
here.
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
a
few
cases,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
--
these
two
cases
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
go
back
on
the
40,000
so
that
non-jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
is
no
jurisdiction
or
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
raising
to
the
appellant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
raising
to
the
petitioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
the
--
the
legal
relevance,
just
want
to
know
what
the
scale
of
the
problem
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you
about
the
case
put
by
mr.
justice
whittaker.
a
kid
is
brought
in
by
his
alien
parents
and
they
then
--
and
they
stay
here
two
years,
the
family
stays
here
two
years,
then
they
go
back
for
a
month
or
two
(inaudible)
go
back.
now,
and
then
he
comes
here
unlawfully
himself,
stays
less
than
a
year
or
comes
here
lawfully
and
stays
less
than
a
year,
does
the
--
does
the
juvenile
--
does
the
minority
here
comes?
what
about
that?
i
can
follow
your
argument
that
the
--
that
the
lawful
entry
and
a
--
and
a
year's
physical
present
conditions
for
getting
naturalization
should
conjoin,
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
in
the
case
but
i
put
--
drawing
it
from
justice
whittaker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
not
--
no
connection
with
the
--
that
the
year
can
be
wholly
unrelated
to
the
subsequent
service
in
the
army.
justice
felix
frankfurter
immediately
preceding
the
service?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
i
was
here,
as
i
was
from,
what,
1894
and
1895
and
then
my
parents
show
and
go
back
to
the
vienna,
i
would
have
been
here
a
year
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
of
entering,
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
immediately
preceding
the
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
anytime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
year
must
have
--
must
have
been
at
least
a
year
at
the
moment
that
he
is
called
out,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i
feel
in
--
clouding
my
own
mind
whether
you
say
that
the
statute
required
that
when
he
called
out,
he
should
have
been
continuously
at
least
for
a
year
preceding
the
call
up
been
here
rather
than
allowing
a
hiatus
between
the
year
plus
--
he
may
have
been
here
after
the
call
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
there
must
be
continuity
there,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
break
in
the
time
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
printed
that
statement
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
of
the
policy,
it
makes
me
so
suspicious
that
a
great
weight
be
attached
to
this
(inaudible)
interchanges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
reading
again
why
--
why
the
senate
--
what
--
what
statement
we
have
from
the
senate
that's
authoritative
as
to
the
physical
presence
for
a
year?
what
was
the
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
the
senate
put
that
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
gave
no
reasons
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
selective
service
act,
the
requirement
is
that
he
--
at
the
time
that
he
must
--
just
call
up,
if
that's
the
term,
he
--
he
then
was
in
the
process
of
continuously
having
been
and
still
being
here
and
not
a
prior
presence
here,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
read
again
the
tense,
who
has
been,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
has
remained,
this
is
having
been
physically
present.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
--
do
i
understand,
i'm
still
hopping
on
that
amendment
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
senate.
was
that
--
was
that
written
in
by
the
committee
as
it
reported
the
bill
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
permitted
in
the
assembly
except
what
you
reported,
namely,
it
should
be
more
in
alignment
with
the
selective
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
no
--
i
just
want
to
know
whether
i
get
this.
there
was
no
discussion
of
that
in
the
senate,
then
they
had
to
go
back
to
the
house
and
a
conference
committee
had
to
be
appointed,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
nothing
was
said
in
the
conference
committee
on
this
subject
at
all,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
comment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
have
to
come
to
this
country
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
for
instance,
free
french
couldn't
join
the
american
units?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
under
this
provision,
there
was
no
other
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
have
been
special
acts
granting
naturalization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
at
this
time,
i
mean
congress
has
passed
individual
naturalization
acts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
a
number
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
a
suspendable
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
