mr.
william
b.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
judges.
this
matter
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
second
circuit
which
court
reversed
an
order
of
the
honorable
thomas
j.
murphy,
a
united
states
district
judge
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
which
had
disapproved
the
findings
of
a
naturalization
commissioner
and
ordered
that
the
application
of
tak
shan
fong
for
naturalization
under
title
8,
section
1440a
of
the
united
states
code
be
granted.
the
statute
that
we're
concerned
with
your
honors
is,
as
i
have
stated,
section
1440a,
and
we
are
more
concerned
with
an
interpretation
order,
a
construction
of
subdivision
ii
which
we'll
find
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
brief
of
having
been
lawfully
admitted
to
the
united
states
and
having
been
physically
present
within
the
united
states
for
a
single
period
of
at
least
one
year
at
the
time
of
entering
the
armed
forces.
under
those
circumstances
an
alien
maybe
naturalized
under
the
requirements
of
that
chapter.
the
factual
situation
in
this
particular
matter
is
that
tak
shan
fong,
a
native
of
china,
shipped
from
china
in
1951
on
board
a
boat
known
as
the
ocean
star
and
he
--
the
boat
docked
at
honolulu
in
the
territory
of
hawaii
and
he
was
granted
a
29-day
seaman
pass.
as
a
result
of
receiving
that
pass
he
was
in
honolulu
for
a
period
of
29
days
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
time,
he
boarded
his
vessel
again
and
left
honolulu.
and
in
january
of
1952,
approximately
four
months
thereafter,
the
same
ship
docked
at
newport
news,
virginia
and
that
was
in
january
of
1952.
now
on
that
particular
question
you
will
find
some
conflict
at
page
8
of
the
record
in
as
much
as
the
exhibit
attached
to
the
record
shows
that
the
man
allegedly
jumped
ship.
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
reference
to
testimony
on
the
part
of
tak
shan
fong
to
the
affect
that
he
was
given
permission
by
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
ship
for
shore
leave
that
he
left
newport
news,
virginia
went
to
new
york
and
upon
his
return
four
days
later
the
ship
had
left
port
and
he
was
without
ship.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
the
--
yes,
they
have
held
that.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
essential
to
do
it
in
view
of
the
sparsity
of
the
record
in
this
particular
case,
particularly
as
to
what
appeared
before
the
naturalization
examiner
sometime
in
january
of
1956.
as
i
said
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
no,
i
don't,
i
really
don't.
i
think
we
have
a
more
substantial
question
involved
here.
as
i
said
that
was
january
1952,
when
it's
alleged
that
he
jumped
ship
and
it
was
in
june
of
1952
that
he
was
apprehended
in
new
york
city
and
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
tak
shan
fong.
while
those
proceedings
were
pending
and
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
selective
service
act,
he
was
compelled
to
register.
and
in
may
of
1953,
he
was
inducted
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
and
he
served
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
from
may
4th,
1953
until
may
3rd,
1955
when
he
was
honorably
discharged.
now,
in
between
that
particular
period
that
i
have
just
indicated
induction
of
may
4th,
1953
and
may
3rd,
1955,
the
local
board,
that
is
the
selective
service
board
received
a
communication
from
the
immigration
service
in
new
york
city
asking
for
official
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
this
man
had
been
inducted
into
service,
that
was
in
september
of
1953.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
ever
a
reply
to
that
communication,
but
it's
quite
logical
that
a
reply
was
given
to
the
immigration
service
in
new
york
city
to
the
affect
that
the
man
was
already
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
nothing
was
done
by
the
immigration
knowing
that
the
man
now
was
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
but
in
january
of
1954
an
order
of
deportation
was
issued,
but
the
delivery
bond
was
suspended
and
the
proceedings
updated
because
of
the
fact
that
they
then
have
knowledge
that
he
was
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
was
january
of
1954.
they
do
nothing
about
it.
they
left
the
man
go
on
and
continue
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
as
i
said
before,
he
was
honorably
discharged
on
may
3rd
of
1955.
and
from
that
period
up
to
and
including
december
22nd,
1955,
the
immigration
authorities
take
no
action
whatsoever.
but
on
december
22nd,
1955,
he
filed
a
petition
for
naturalization
under
the
provisions
of
section
1440a
of
8
united
states
code
and
immediately
a
hearing
was
directed.
at
that
particular
hearing,
the
naturalization
examiner
knew
nothing
of
his
legal
entry
into
the
united
states
in
1951.
and
although
he
found
that
tak
shan
fong
came
within
all
the
other
provisions
of
section
1440a,
he
nevertheless
found
that
he
had
entered
the
united
states
unlawfully
basing
it
upon
this
so-called
jumping
ship
in
january
of
1952.
so
that
he
made
a
finding
to
the
effect
that
the
man
was
unlawfully
in
the
country
therefore
he
doesn't
come
within
the
purview
of
the
provisions
of
section
1440a.
and
he
recommended
the
denial
of
the
petition.
that
came
on
before
justice
murphy
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
at
that
particular
time
counsel
who
was
then
representing
tak
shan
fong
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
this
man
had
been
legally
in
the
united
states
in
1951
in
august.
an
opportunity
was
given
to
the
examiner
to
verify
that
particular
fact
from
the
official
records,
and
it
was
so
verified.
and
as
a
result
of
it,
justice
murphy
made
new
findings
of
fact
wherein
he
decided
that
the
man
was
lawfully
in
the
united
states
and
that
he
came
within
the
purview
of
all
of
the
provisions
of
section
1440a.
he
directed
that
an
order
of
naturalization
issue.
the
order
was
issued.the
man
appeared,
qualified,
certificate
of
naturalization
was
granted.
the
government
took
an
appeal
from
that
particular
order
and
it
came
on
before
the
circuit
court
for
the
second
circuit.
and
when
this
came
on
for
argument
that
court
had
already
decided
in
the
matter
of
u.s.against
boubaris
which
the
court
will
find
in
244
f2.d
at
98.
that
was
before
a
bench
made
up
of
justices
lumbard,
waterman
and
judge
hincks.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
thank
you,
your
honor.
as
i
stated,
your
honor,
the
boubaris
case
had
reached
the
circuit
court
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal
in
this
particular
matter.
and
in
that
particular
case,
judges
lumbard
and
waterman
reversed
the
lower
court
that
had
held
and
held
at
that
particular
time
that
the
provision
in
section
1440a
relative
to
lawful
entry
and
the
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
a
year
before
induction
into
the
armed
services
must
be
consecutive.
in
other
words,
no
breach
could
occur
within
the
lawful
entry
and
the
physical
presence
of
a
year
in
the
united
states.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
hincks
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
and
judge
hincks
dissented.
and
then
when,
as
i
said,
that
case
was
decided
while
this
one
was
coming
up
on
appeal
and
when
it
came
up
on
appeal,
again
justices
lumbard
and
waterman
sat,
but
justice
moore
sat
in
place
of
justice
hincks
on
the
tak
shan
fong
case.
and
this,
of
course,
judge
murphy
was
unanimously
reversed
on
the
opinion
or
rather
the
decision
in
u.s.
against
boubaris.
now,
in
order
to
come
to
some
analyzation
of
this
particular
statute,
it
would
seem
to
me
as
though
with
the
government
conceding
practically
everything
in
the
case,
namely,
that
fong
was
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
year
prior
to
his
induction
into
the
service
of
the
united
states,
that
he
served
in
the
united
states
army
for
a
period
of
two
years,
that
he
was
honorably
discharged,
and
that
he
had
made
a
lawful
entry
into
the
united
states
in
august
of
1951.
we
come
right
down
to
the
one
question
that
the
government
seems
to
base
everything
on
and
that
is
that
the
lawful
entry
and
the
physical
presence
was
not
continuous.
that's
the
only
claim
that
they
seem
to
make.
and
may
i
say
to
the
court
here
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
lawful
entry
and
the
physical
presence
for
a
year
must
be
consecutive.
it
--
it
would
seem
to
me
as
though
that
circuit
court
just
wrote
that
particular
provision
into
section
1440a.
now,
resort
to
the
--
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
situation
reveals
this
that
when
it
was
before
the
house
committee,
congressman
graham
on
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
was
asked
as
to
who
was
excluded
under
the
bill.
and
his
statement
was,
and
this
is
taken
from
the
first
session
of
the
house
of
representatives
for
the
83rd
congress,
subversives
are
excluded,
a
conscientious
objector
who
performs
no
military
duties
or
refuses
to
wear
the
uniform
are
excluded
or
a
person
discharged
from
service
under
oath
other
than
honorable
conditions
are
excluded
or
pursuant
to
an
application
for
discharge
made
by
him
on
the
ground
that
he
is
an
alien.
now,
that
seemed
to
be
the
thinking
of
the
members
of
the
house
as
to
who
were
excluded
under
this
particular
bill,
although
there
was
phraseology
that
its
application
was
limited
to
those
who
were
lawfully
entered
into
the
united
states
without
designating
any
time
element
whatsoever.
however,
when
this
bill
was
pending
before
the
house,
the
attorney
general
rogers
sent
a
letter
to
the
house
in
which
he
tried
to
have
incorporated
the
provisions
of
section
1429
of
8
united
states
code
into
the
bill
itself.
and
it's
under
1429,
you'll
recall,
that
the
burden
rests
upon
the
applicant
to
show
at
the
time
that
he
applies
for
naturalization
that
he
was
lawfully
admitted
to
the
united
states.
and
the
letters,
just
a
short
part
of
it,
was
to
the
effect
since
the
bill
would
require
the
lawful
admission
of
a
person
as
a
prerequisite
to
eligibility
thereunder.
there
would
appear
to
be
no
reason
why
such
a
person
should
not
be
required
to
bear
the
burden
of
proving
such
lawful
admission
to
the
same
extent
as
is
required
of
petitioners
for
naturalization
generally.
now,
that
was
definitely
ignored
by
the
house.
and
in
addition
to
it,
it
was
definitely
ignored
by
the
senate
who
had
the
same
letter
before
it
and
that
provision
or
anything
bearing
any
comparability
to
it
was
enacted
into
the
statute
itself.
and
it
would
seem
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
--
the
attorney
general
tried
to
continue
the
burden
upon
an
applicant
to
show
that
his
lawful
entry
or
rather
that
his
entry
into
the
united
states
was
lawful.
and
when
you
find
the
house
reacting
to
the
suggestion
of
an
attorney
general
in
this
particular
nature
while
lawful
admission
as
an
immigrant
or
a
non-immigrant
is
held
to
be
a
prerequisite
to
naturalization,
the
committee
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
technicalities
involved
in
connection
with
the
continuance
of
such
status
at
the
time
of
entering
the
armed
forces
would
place
an
unwarranted
burden
on
servicemen
and
practically
nullify
the
purpose
of
the
legislation.
and
as
to
the
senate
itself,
they
merely
stated
that
the
proposal
that
the
serviceman
be
required
to
have
a
lawful
status
at
the
time
of
entering
the
armed
forces
was
not
included
in
the
bill,
so
much
for
whatever
assistance
that
we
might
get
from
the
legislative
history
behind
this
particular
bill.
but
i
could
point
out
to
the
court
at
this
particular
time
that
if
congress
were
of
the
mind
that
the
government
attempts
at
the
present
time
to
state
what
the
thought
of
congress
was
at
the
time,
it
would
seem
to
me
as
though
they
could
have
legislated
as
they
did
relative
to
section
392
(b)
of
the
same
title
8
of
the
united
states
code.
and
you'll
recall,
this
is
found
on
page
9
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
that
under
those
circumstances
where
they
were
endeavoring
to
confer
citizenship
on
alien
veterans
relative
to
world
war
i,
the
court
will
find
that
an
alien
in
this
particular
section
392
(b),
an
alien
veteran
is
entitled
at
any
time
to
naturalization
upon
the
same
terms
and
conditions
except
one
that
such
alien
shall
be
required
to
prove
that
immediately
preceding
the
date
of
his
petition,
he
has
resided
continuously
within
united
states
for
at
least
two
years
in
pursuance
of
a
legal
admission
for
permanent
residence.
now,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
word
"immediately"
in
there
is
significant
and
"legal
admission"
is
significant
and
if
congress
were
of
the
trend
of
thinking
that
the
government
attempts
to
suggest
at
the
present
time,
it
would
seem
to
me
as
though
they
could
have
readily
enacted
some
specific
provision
in
here
showing
that
such
was
their
intention,
namely,
that
lawful
entry
and
physical
presence
for
a
year
had
to
be
consecutive.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
certainly
do,
your
honor,
because
you
can
appreciate
that
there
are
a
number
of
individuals
who
are
in
the
united
states
and
have
been
lawfully
admitted
but
not
for
permanent
residence.
they
put
those
people
of
permanent
residence
in
one
category.
and
i
think
in
this
order
that
they
had
mind
that
any
of
those
individuals
who
were
in
the
united
states
and
had
been
in
lawfully
at
any
time
as
long
as
they
did
what
was
necessary
to
be
done
under
section
1440a,
namely,
that
they
lent
their
services
whether
it
was
mental,
moral,
physical
to
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
during
the
korean
conflict.we
held
this
out
to
those
people
that
there
would
be
a
reward
attached
to
the
services
that
they
render.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
as
broad
as
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
can't
see
that
under
the
circumstances
that
are
contained
in
this
statute
and
i
am
not
just
limiting
it
to
the
phraseology
that
you've
pointed
out
to
me
but
to
the
statute
in
toto
that
i
can't
see
under
those
circumstances
where
there
would
be
any
difference,
as
long
as
he
came
into
the
country
legally
at
some
time
prior
to
the
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
a
year
and
that
he
had
served
beyond
90
days
which
is
the
minimum
requirement
of
the
statute
and
that
he
was
honorable
discharged.
i
just
don't
go
for
and
i
can't
conceive
that
a
court
would
accept
a
solution
of
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
we
hold
out
these
rewards
or
anticipated
rewards
to
aliens
with
some
subtle
variations
to
them
that
spring
up
after
we've
taken
from
the
individual
that
which
they
were
capable
of
giving
under
the
selective
service
act.
that
just
doesn't
seem
to
savvy
with
the
policy
of
the
united
states.and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
time
element
would
make
no
difference
in
this
particular
matter.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that
alone
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
think
you're
quite
right.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
and
they
wanted
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
one
year
prior
to
his
induction
or
his
--
and
i
think,
for
the
opportunity
of
ascertaining
from
his
record
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
oh,
no,
i
say
standing
alone,
your
honor,
i
definitely
would
accede
to
that
query.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
not
one
bit.
now,
in
addition
to
what
i've
just
stated
to
the
court
here,
relative
to
the
legislative
history,
i
would
merely
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
where
there
is
an
ambiguity
and
certainty,
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
section
1440a,
and
i
think
quite
a
substantial
one,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
trend
of
thinking
of
this
particular
court
has
been
to
resolve
that
ambiguity
in
favor
of
lenity.
and
the
court
will
recall
that
in
bell
against
the
united
states
that
that
was
a
principle
who
has
stated
and
also
it
was
recently
reiterated
in
the
matter
of
bonetti
against
rogers
in
this
particular
court.
but
another
factor
that
i
think
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
this
particular
matter
is
this
factor.
you
will
recall
what
i
said
that
in
september
1953,
the
exclusion
section
of
the
immigration
department
knew
of
the
fact
that
this
man
was
in
the
military
service
of
the
united
states.
in
january
of
1954
with
the
order
of
deportation
when
they
suspended
the
delivery
bond,
they
knew
that
he
was
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
they
continued
to
allow
him
to
serve
for
19
months
after
the
verification
of
september
1953,
they
allowed
him
to
serve
16
months
after
the
deportation
order
was
served
and
then
they
allowed
him
to
continue
in
the
united
states
from
may
of
1955
until
december
of
1955
when
he
filed
his
petition
under
section
1448
of
title
8
of
the
united
states
code.
in
the
--
in
the
interim
they
just
allowed
everything
to
abate.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
think
that
they
only
sort
of
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that
is
a
point
up
of
the
hardship
and
i
think
that
they
have
some
relevance
as
to
the
ambiguity
which
i
assert
is
contained
in
this
particular
statute.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that's
very
true,
i
merely
like
to
say
this,
your
honors,
and
just
cite
this
last
factor
to
you,
and
this
is
on
the
proposition
that
when
an
ambiguity
is
existent
under
those
circumstances
that
ambiguity
is
always
resolved
in
favor
of
lenity.
we
had
a
similar
--
somewhat
of
a
similar
situation
in
fong
haw
tan
against
phelan
in
333
u.s.
6.
and
in
that
particular
situation
with
an
opinion
by
justice
douglas,
he
said
that
we
resolve
the
doubts
in
favor
of
that
construction
because
deportation
is
a
drastic
measure
and
at
times,
the
equivalent
of
banishment
or
exile.
it
is
the
forfeiture
for
misconduct
of
a
residence
in
this
country,
that
was
somewhat
dissimilar
from
our
factual
background
but
such
forfeiture
is
a
penalty.
and
i
say
that
what
was
read
into
this
particular
boubaris
case
in
the
first
instance
and
carried
over
into
tak
shan
fong
was
strictly
an
infliction
of
a
penalty
upon
tak
shan
fong
in
writing
into
section
1440
(a),
the
fact
that
lawful
entry
and
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
must
be
immediately
consecutive.
and
i
ask
the
court,
for
those
reasons,
to
reverse
the
circuit
court
and
reinstate
judge
murphy's
order.
