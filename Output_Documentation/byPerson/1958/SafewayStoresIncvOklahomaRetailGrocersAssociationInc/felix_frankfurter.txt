justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
if
the
local
law
has
decided
that
trading
stamps,
giving
trading
stamps
did
not
involve
a
reduction
of
the
cost
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
that
through
discounts
you
would
be
part
of
the
list
it
has
through
discounts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
--
do
they
sell
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
i
not
hear
you
say
a
little
earlier
that
safeway
before
reducing
in
response
to
the
benefit,
if
i
may
call
it
that,
the
trading
stamps
figured
out
exactly
what's
the
monetary
end
it
was,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
we
have
fairly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
say
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
option
was
better
than
the
one
way
of
talking,
but
my
question
was
whether
the
money
value
of
the
trading
stamp
is
reasonably
as
ascertainable
whether
the
--
what
it
means
in
cents,
or
the
accumulated
cents
amounting
to
dollars
to
the
housewives
to
get
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
acceptable
has
gone
for
that
need
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
basis
of
who
--
that
has
weight?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
housewife
trying
to
do
was
the
two
2.5
cents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
all
of
the
purchase
it
would
be
worth
5
cents
to
the
housewife
is
she
gives
the
payment
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
is
that
common
ground
between
you
and
the
appellees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
evidence
as
to
the
volume
of
the
retention
of
these
trading
stamps?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
having
to
--
have
considered
how
many
states
have
forbidden
trading
stamps?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
(inaudible)
case
that
dedication
not
only
one
--
came
up
with
several
states
as
i
remember,
that
outlawed
the
giving
of
trading
stamps.
i'm
just
curious
to
know
how
wide-spread
the
restriction
of
the
--
of
traffic
--
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
happened
--
mostly
it
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
driven
--
you
are
driven
from
your
point
of
view
that
had
the
allowability
(inaudible)
how
that
oklahoma
say
that
trading
stamps
are
not
the
kind
of
reduction
of
cost
has
enabled
the
competitor
to
meet
that
reduction
because
now
that
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
has
given
that
meaning
for
that
statute
it
doesn't
show
that
in
the
--
by
the
legislation
and
you
must
take
it
at
that,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i
didn't
suggest
that
therefore
it
is
valid.
i'm
merely
suggesting
therefore,
whether
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
to
make
the
complete
even
arbitrary
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
for
us
to
say.
there
it
is
and
for
(inaudible)
it
is
as
though
it
had
been
spelled
out
by
the
legislature,
the
way
the
supreme
court
has
now
spelled
it
out
then
if
you
take
the
problem
that
you
put
to
us
mainly
is
a
statute.
would
that
(inaudible)
of
the
allowable
freedom
of
merchants
to
deal
with
one
another
through
competition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
should
get
you
to
believe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
if
reading
of
the
oklahoma
statute
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
any
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
dare
say
before
that
court
if
you
argue
(inaudible)
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
think
that
the
--
we
have
no
choice.
that's
supposed
the
way
the
court
--
the
statement
has
no
choice,
did
you
have
a
choice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
an
issue
the
correctness
of
that
claim
or
is
that
relevant
to
--
to
the
problem
that
you
have
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
does
that
indicate
that
--
that
you
may
call
it
a
discount
but
a
money
discount
is
something
else
than
a
trading
stamp
discount
rather
to
have
this
psychological
element,
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it's
just
dollars
--
or
just
cents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
merely
needing
--
merely
needing
a
trading
stamp
as
money
--
with
money
differential
doesn't
meet
the
province
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
returning
the
cash,
would
that
meet
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
turn
it
around
the
other
way.
if
they
can
stand
to
have
factors
that
are
not
measurable
by
cents
and
therefore
a
dollar,
then
you
got
a
different
ingredient
having
to
do
with
your
problem
and
then
the
question
comes
that
the
legislature,
because
that's
the
way
i
take
the
decision
of
the
court,
a
failure
of
the
construction
of
the
statute
then
your
supreme
court,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
rather
has
made
a
difference
between
money
inducement
and
--
and
calls
illogical
inducement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
not
--
and
that
is
not
a
consideration
relevant
to
the
problem
before
us,
mr.
clark?
that
issue
is
not
here
on
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
this
is
not
within
the
below-cost,
specific.
they
say
this
is
not
--
you
are
not
allowed
under
the
fair
trading
act
of
oklahoma
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
they
give
trading
stamp.
you
would
be
able
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
they
give
back
to
the
cents
wouldn't
you,
under
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
times
of,
mr.
lane,
at
the
times
of
the
trading
stamps
cases
were
here
and
minute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hear
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
it's
not
fair
to
call
that
minute
but
there
were
--
there
were
more
than
two
states
or
three
states
then
that
outlawed
it,
is
that
true?
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
rast
against
van
deman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
--
the
rast
case
or
one
of
these
that
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mckenna's,
i
cherish
for
having
cut
out
the
diagram
of
one
of
the
most
important
observations
on
constitutional
adjudication
that
we
should
go
from
judgment
by
speculation
to
judgment
by
securing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
give
for
justice
black's
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
lane?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
same
stipulation
is
supposed
to
be
certain
without
legal
justification,
does
--
does
that
phraseology
is
that
accusation
--
include
testing
by
the
very
act
which
is
in
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
to
include
the
lack
of
legal
justification
by
assuming
that
they
litigate
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
can
understand
but
if
he
is
meeting
competition,
on
the
assumption
that
giving
away
trading
stamps
enables
him
to
do
what
he
does
and
then
the
argument
is,
no,
giving
away
of
trading
stamps
is
in
fact,
that
implicates
configuration
of
the
scope
and
validity
of
the
statute,
that's
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
would
he
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
all
business
may
do
and
they're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
forbidden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
there's
some
either
a
statutory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
decisional
limitation
of
findings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
my
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
is
that
i
dare
say
this
and
maybe
you
need
to
answer
that.
my
only
question
was
what
is
wrapped
up
in
this
place
without
legal
justification
and
i
was
wondering
whether
there
was
also
wrapped
up
in
it
that
under
the
statute,
without
we
can't
meet
trading
stamps
accepting
distribution
in
the
way
which
he
has
because
a
trading
stamp
is
not
anything
that
affects
price
but
it's
just
a
psychologically
inducement.
that's
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
reject
the
argument.
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
the
argument
of
mr.
clark
here,
that
to
make
such
legal
determination
or
such
statutory
prohibitions
against
trading
stamp
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state.
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
a
very
different
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
that
stage
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
way
in
which
the
modern
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
this
man
can't
cut
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
prices,
not
through
a
competition
but
because
he
hates
the
other
fellow
and
wants
to
drive
him
out
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
that
--
as
i
understand
modern
law
of
thought
even
in
my
day,
way
back
in
the
law
school,
even
way
back
as
a
student,
there's
already
emerging
disaster
whether
mankind
exercises
property
rights
merely
out
of
custom.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
isn't
but
the
suggestion
here
isn't
that
kind
question
in
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i
don't
understand
pinning
on
it
the
label,
“therefore,
it
was
in
bad
faith.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lane,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
but
before
i
do
so,
it
was
supposedly
drafted
in
oklahoma.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
form
of
--
of
your
suggestion
earlier
that
they
couldn't
construe
it
a
certain
way
because
the
penalties.
so
i
get
the
impression
that
certain
indefiniteness
was
allowed
when
there
are
civil
remedies
but
not
when
there
are
criminal
remedies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
there
isn't
a
distinction.
i
just
don't
know
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
fact,
under
this
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
indefiniteness
so-called
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
not
found,
it
would
not
be
found
as
to
injunction
or
money
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
damages,
but
would
be,
if
there
were
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you
set
it
a
little
earlier.
what
causes
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
court
construe
that
since
there
was
a
criminal
affect
into
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
reason
--
mr.
clark,
is
the
reason
that
according
to
this
figures,
trading
stamps
are
not
included
by
the
smaller
stores,
if
the
reason
either
that
it
took
costly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
size
of
their
business
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
effective
power
of
trading
stamps,
isn't
equal
to
the
investment
of
the
--
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
have
--
do
they
have
their
own
trading
stamp
devices?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lane
spoke
of
what
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
lane
said
that
in
the
district
in
which
the
trading
stamp
is
formally
outlawed
or
statutorily
outlawed,
from
what
mr.
lane
had
said,
he
indicated
that
in
fact
some
kind
of
certification
goes
on,
on
which
you
eventually
can
cash
in,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
the
terms
of
the
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
one
that
--
that
requires
interpretation
whether
a
cash
return
would
be
within
or
without
the
terms
of
the
prohibition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
trading
stamps,
cash
register
receipts
or
other
evidences
of
credit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
would
cover
cash?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
clark,
suppose
oklahoma
has
this
kind
of
a
statute,
it
prohibited
outright
all
sales
below
cost,
except
--
all
sales
below
cost
in
the
grocery
business
and
allowed
no
kind
of
--
to
carry
over
the
terms
in
the
labor
field
fringe
benefits,
except
trading
stamps.
there's
the
flat
rule,
no
sale
below
cost
and
no
additional
advantage
from
the
price
except
trading
stamps
flat,
making
an
exemption
against
the
local
corner
grocery
who's
not
part
of
a
chain
or
hasn't
more
than
two
stores.
what
would
you
say
to
such
a
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
--
would
--
as
a
legislative
which
--
could
certainly
pass
legislation
against
credit
purchases,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
provides
it
should
be
only
a
cash
sale.
it
provides
that
you
shouldn't
undercut
because
while
there
might
be
leaders
or
et
cetera
on
the
whole
that
brings
in
or
permits
(inaudible)
in
all
sorts
of
abuses,
they
--
you're
going
to
have
a
--
a
flat
rule.
no
sale
below
cost,
but
you
can
get
some
advantages
by
the
trading
stamp.
justice
felix
frankfurter
lots
of
legislation
makes
no
rhyme
and
reason
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
legislative
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
this
amounts
in
a
way,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
your
view,
this
trading
stamp,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
why,
because
the
law
enforcing
officers
aren't
on
the
job
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
ask
you
what
i
asked
mr.
lane,
most
of
these
tactics
were
made
for
--
for
business
reasons
and
not
for
malicious
reasons,
aren't
they?
this
is
the
way
of
making
money.
