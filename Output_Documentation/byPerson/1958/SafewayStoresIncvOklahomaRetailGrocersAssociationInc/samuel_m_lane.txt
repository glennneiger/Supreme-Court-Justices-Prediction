mr.
samuel
m.
lane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
becomes
more
of
a
trading
stamp
case
every
minute.
i
really
think
that
when
it
was
tried
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
it
wasn't
nearly
as
much
on
this
trading
stamp
question
as
it
has
become
right
here
in
this
oral
argument.
perhaps,
because
of
the
interest
that
the
court
has
shown
in
trading
stamps
or
i
should
go
back
over
some
of
the
ground
that
mr.
clark
covered
particularly
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
answer
the
questions
would
you
put
to
mr.
clark
about
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
trading
stamps
business
because
surely
you
should
have
a
clear
understanding
of
it,
since
as
i
say
that
it
appears
now
to
become
a
trading
stamp
case.
the
trading
stamps
have
been
in
general
use
through
out
the
united
states
at
least
since
1896.
like
every
other
promotional
device
this
being
a
device
to
promote
sales
through
the
giving
of
trading
stamps
which
effect
a
cash
discount
for
business
has
gone
through
swings
of
prosperity
and
declined.
but
the
sperry
&
hutchinson
company
has
been
in
that
business
continually
since
1896,
never
defaulting
on
any
of
its
obligations.
you
are
all,
i
am
sure,
aware
of
the
increase
since
world
war
ii
in
the
volume
of
trading
stamps
or
that
has
come
about
particularly
through
the
use
of
trading
stamps
in
the
supermarket.
trading
stamps
have
not,
as
my
brother
clark
has
indicated,
caused
the
demise
of
the
independent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
trading
stamps
have
been
traditionally
the
bulwark
of
the
independent
against
the
great
chain
for
their
enormous
purchasing
power.
the
specific
trading
stamps
are
now
prohibited
in
just
two
states,
plus
the
district
of
columbia.
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
a
so-called
gift
enterprise
act
which
bars
the
use
of
trading
stamps
and
manufacturer's
coupons
and
soap
wrap
and
everything
of
that
kind
and
it's
honored
only
in
the
breach
except
as
to
trading
stamps.
so,
your
wives
can
go
into
any
of
the
stores
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
get
manufacturer's
coupons
with
whatever
they
buy
notwithstanding
this
law
but
she
can't
get
trading
stamps
because
the
trading
stamp
companies
haven't
wanted
to
provoke
an
issue
on
that
question.
kansas
prohibits
trading
stamps
and
the
state
of
wyoming
prohibits
trading
stamps.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
right
now
trying
to
touch
the
constitutionality
of
that
act
and
we
have
a
case
pending
in
wyoming
for
the
purpose.
mr.
clark
said
that
--
i
think
at
the
1957
session
of
the
state
legislatures,
there
were
some
30
or
40
bills
for
hospitals
had
trading
stamps.
mr.
clark
wants
to
know
because
the
safeway
company
largely
backs
those
bills
and
this
argument
which
you
are
now
hearing
is
only
an
incident
or
perhaps
a
collateral
one
in
the
attempt
of
the
safeway
company
to
do
away
with
trading
stamps.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
1918,
they
were
here.
there
were
three
cases
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
it
has
waxed
and
waned.
that
is
all
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
i
have
said.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
it's
very
interesting
that
you
read
the
body
of
the
law.
it's
quite
a
--
esoteric
group
of
cases
but
you
see
that
the
--
and
--and
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
it's
a
trading
stamp's
uses,
those
who
use
them
are
most
widely
enthusiastic
about
them
and
conversely
those
who
don't
get
them
are
bitterly
opposed
and
the
opposition
to
the
trading
stamps
has
come
in
waves
from
decade
to
decade.
in
the
beginning,
there
were
statutes
which
sought
absolutely
to
prohibit
trading
stamps.
they
were
called
gift
enterprise
laws.
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
engage
in
the
gift
enterprise
in
which
something
should
be
given
when
something's
purchased
and
those
laws
were
struck
down
as
unconstitutional,
that
is
to
say,
a
deprivation
of
right
to
freedom
to
contract
and
to
sell
for
what
you
want
to.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
in
--
in
the
states,
they
were
struck
down
over
and
over.
that's
just
from
let's
say
1900
to
1910.
then
the
next
wave
that
followed
that
was
a
series
of
decisions
in
which
the
states
sought
to
tax
the
stamps
out
of
existence
and
the
court
said
it
is
the
same
thing.
we'll
treat
it
the
same
way.
it's
a
discriminatory
tax
and
banned.
then
in
1918,
you
had
three
cases
that
reached
this
court.
one
from
the
state
of
florida
and
two
from
the
state
of
washington
and
pitney
against
washington
was
the
trading
stamp
case
and
in
that
case,
this
court
said,
“we
will
look
at
this
tax
on
trading
stamps
redeemable
in
merchandise
for
what
it
really
is.
it's
a
prohibitive
tax,
so
we
will
consider
that
the
state
of
washington
has
prohibited
the
use
of
trading
stamps
redeemable
in
merchandise.
and
as
to
that,
we
will
sustain
it
because
there
is
something
so
indefinite
about
stamps
redeemable
in
merchandise,
but
perhaps
an
ignorant
person
with
the
attraction
of
trading
stamps
might
be
led
--
might
be
misled
rather
to
pay
her
money
unwisely
but
this
court
pointed
out
that
if
trading
stamps
were
redeemable
in
cash
about
which
there
could
be
no
uncertainty.
so
then
this
court
would
not
sustain
a
prohibition
whether
it
was
couched
as
a
tax
or
not.
and
consequently,
from
that
day
to
this,
trading
stamps
have
been
used
in
the
state
of
washington
but
in
that
state,
they
are
redeemable
only
in
cash
and
the
consequence
in
substance
to
the
people
of
washington
is
that
they
don't
get
as
great
a
value
for
their
stamps
as
they
would
otherwise
because
naturally,
the
trading
stamp
company
can't
give
as
large
a
value
in
cash
as
they
would
in
merchandise
since
their
great
purchasing
power
enables
them
to
give
a
better
value
in
merchandise
than
in
cash.
so,
in
fact
we
come
down
to
the
case
at
bar
because
i
think
the
case
at
bar
is
really
quite
different
than
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well
the
other
two,
one
was
something
about
rolly
or
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
rast
against
van
deman
was
a
case
involving
manufacturer's
coupon,
state
against
pitney
involved
trading
stamps
and
the
tanner
against
little
involved
the
coupons
that
came
in
united
tobacco
cigarettes
or
something
of
that
kind.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
i
may
say
then,
your
honor,
you
probably
mean
by
that
because
i
find
that
running
through
your
opinions
time
and
time
again
that
this
field
that
were
talking
about
is
an
empirical
field
and
not
a
pragmatic
or
purely
logical
field.
i
think
actually
on
the
(inaudible)
of
this
case
when
we
come
to
it.
and
i
would
say,
too,
as
i
leave
those
cases
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
were
imperative
in
three
decisions
which
came
down
right
after
them.
one
at
kansas,
one
in
maryland
i
can't
recall
where
the
other
one
was.
but
after
that
and
as
early
as
1921,
no
court
has
ever
followed
this
court.
no
state
court,
in
upholding
the
prohibition
of
trading
stamps
and
back
to
massachusetts
where
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
come
from.
it
has
been
repeatedly
held
by
the
court.
one
decision
i
recall
by
justice
holmes
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
now,
what
are
we
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
to
--
to
what
a
--
a
--
to
ban
the
use
of
trading
stamps,
it
being
a
perfectly
legitimate
business,
which
brings
me
mr.
justice
black,
to
what
you
have
asked
several
times
of
my
opponent.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
today.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
the
light
of
recent
decisions
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
perhaps
today,
the
decision
might
go
the
other
way.
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
in
this
case
is
one
of
state
power
and
if
the
state
adopts
a
policy
which
is
either
favorable
to
or
hostile
to
this
particular
economic
device,
now
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it's
not
up
to
this
court
to
strike
that
down.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
morey
against
doud
as
i
recall
it
is
the
only
case
in
this
court
in
the
last
25
years
which
has
struck
down
under
the
due
process
or
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
state
regulatory
statute
and
that
i
suggest
was
a
most
extreme
case
and
that
it
doesn't
i
think
represent
so
much
a
split
in
this
court
on
the
law
as
it
does
in
the
interpretation
of
the
facts.
i
think
the
very
strong
dissent
indicated
that
there
was
in
fact,
economic
justification
for
exempting
the
american
express
company
imposed
of
telegraph
and
the
western
union
and
then
when
the
facts
changed
then
the
law
might
change.
but
as
the
facts
stood,
the
law
was
constitutional.
the
majority
have
crossed,
took
the
other
view
but
compare
that
case
to
this
case,
when
you
--
as
i
hope
you
will
do
understand
the
fact
and
this
then
is
a
very
much
easier
case
to
decide.
now,
may
i
come
back
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
easier
for
both
justice
black
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
black
and
yourself.[laughter]
now,
may
i
come
down
to
this
case
because
we
--
we
shouldn't
be
discussing
this
thing
here
in
--
in
vacuo
it
seems
to
me.
what
happened
here
was
that
in
july
1954,
the
safeway
company
deliberately
went
out
for
a
larger
share
of
the
business
in
oklahoma.
i
think
there
were
18,
not
28
safeway
stores
in
oklahoma
city
and
they
enjoyed
at
that
time
17%
of
the
total
volume
of
the
grocery
business
in
oklahoma.
there
were
about
400
competing
stores
there.
the
record
shows
that
safeway
operated
by
quotas.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
quotas.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that
it
had
an
objective
to
reach
the
quota
for
oklahoma
city
was
20%
now
they're
only
--
enjoyed
17%.
so
in
july
1954,
it
cut
prices
on
the
--
on
--
on
a
handful
of
traffic
items
like
sugar
and
lard
and
shortening
and
things
like
that
which
were
all
selling
at
about
the
same
price
in
the
oklahoma
market.
the
effect
of
that
was,
of
course,
immediate.
there
was
a
price
war
which
started
immediately.
and
in
order
to
nip
that
price
war
in
the
bud,
the
oklahoma
grocers
association
applied
for
a
restraining
order
and
a
temporary
injunction.
there
was
a
two-day
trial
and
the
temporary
injunction
was
granted.
all
during
that
trial
in
those
two
days,
the
questions
about
trading
stamps
were
discussed
at
length.
the
effect
of
trading
stamps
was
discussed
at
length
leading
mandate
of
the
statutes
which
says
that
the
remedy
here
is
by
injunction
was
discussed
at
length
and
safeway's
position
was
not
successful.
now
it
isn't
--
opening
in
the
grocery's
business
likes
to
sue
one
another,
obviously,
and
when
the
oklahoma
retail
grocers
association
had
secured
this
temporary
injunction
and
made
their
point,
they
then
discontinued
the
action.
two
weeks
later,
safeway
came
back
and
hit
them
again,
this
time
with
price
cuts
not
only
in
oklahoma
city
but
also
in
enid,
shawnee,
tulsa
and
norman
without
pretending
at
all
that
in
enid,
shawnee,
norman
and
tulsa
they
were
matching
trading
stamp
prices.
they
merely
contended
that
as
to
those
cities,
one
or
more
of
their
competitors
was
selling
at
a
price
below
cost
and
that
was
what
they
said
permitted
them
under
this
act
to
cut
the
price
of
the
same
articles
against
all
their
competitors
whether
or
not
the
other
competitors
cut
the
price.
it
was
only
in
oklahoma
city
that
they
claim
to
be
doing
this
as
a
defense
against
trading
stamps.
the
trial
court
on
to
hearing
all
of
the
elements
made
the
following
finding
of
fact
which
appears
on
the
record
at
page
447.
“the
court
finds
that
on
the
dates
alleged
in
plaintiff's
petition
the
defendant
safeway
without
legal
justification
willfully
and
intentionally
reduced
its
prices
in
an
effort
to
increase
its
volume
to
the
detriment
of
the
other
grocers.”
the
significance
of
that
will
be
readily
apparent
to
you,
because
in
this
court,
what
the
appellant
is
arguing
is
that
it
has
been
denied
the
right
in
good
faith
to
meet
the
lower
cost
of
its
competitors.
it
cut,
i
submit,
even
claimed
the
right
to
meet
the
lower
prices
of
its
competitors
unless
it
proceeds
in
good
faith.
i
know
that
if
it
were
here
under
the
robinson-patman
act
instead
of
under
the
oklahoma
sales
act,
it
would
not
be
heard
to
say
that
it
has
the
right
in
bad
faith
to
meet
the
lower
cost
of
its
competitors
which
costs
also
are
illegal
costs.
here
is
a
finding
of
fact
against
the
appellant
on
the
question
of
good
faith
and
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that
is
on
page
447
at
the
top
of
the
page.
it
seems
to
me
that
having
been
found
on
the
facts
in
a
hotly
contested
trial
to
have
acted
in
bad
faith,
we're
left
with
nothing
but
a
hypothetical
as
to
what
the
situation
would
be
had
the
company
acted
in
good
faith.
the
court
also
or
rather
the
court
of
the
--
the
supreme
court
in
affirming
the
lower
court
had
this
to
say.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that
it
seems
to
me
is
one
phase
of
it.
the
court
--
this
trial
court
had
a
good
deal
to
say
on
that.
if
your
honor
would
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
442,
you
will
see
what
the
trial
judge
said
after
that.
he
said,
"gentlemen,
to
attempt
to
handle
these
problems
in
any
other
manner”,
that
is
to
say,
“in
any
manner
other
than
by
the
orderly
process
of
an
injunction
couldn't
have
any
other
effect
than
to
bring
chaos
for
safeway
sets
a
price,
blakemore
and
my
district
reduces
it.”
safeway
says,
“they're
going
to
meet
it.”
the
red
(inaudible)
stores
then
reduced
their
price
and
there
we
go.
“it
has
nothing
but
chaos
gentlemen.
one
violation
just
brings
about
another.
i
say
to
handle
it
in
any
other
manner
except
in
the
orderly
manner
as
provided
by
the
statute
will
only
bring
chaos
in
the
grocery
business
and
have
the
net
results
of
ruining
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
small
independent
merchants,”
and
that's
the
only
logical
conclusion
the
court
can
come
to
here.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i'm
probably
stupid.
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
your
question
is
a
very
easy
one
but
i
don't
follow
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
a
question
of
fact
here
of
the
--
the
statute
says
that
you
can
in
good
faith
meet
the
price
of
your
competitor
who
is
selling
at
cost
to
him.
now,
there
are
several
questions
there
of
fact.
the
first
is
when
you
meet
his
price,
do
you
really
believe
that
the
price
you're
meeting
is
his
cost
to
him
or
do
you
know
in
fact
that
he's
selling
below
his
cost
and
in
violation
of
the
statute?
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
but
in
the
first
place,
he
lost
as
a
question
of
fact
as
to
what
he
was
trying
to
do.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
they
found
as
the
question
of
fact
that
this
wasn't
his
purpose
at
all.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
the
purpose
was
to
grab
more
of
the
business.
now
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that's
right,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
frankfurter.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
i
assume
that
--
that
could
fall
under
this
phrase
that
we
read
without
legal
justifications
but
that's
only
one
of
a
number
of
things.
look
at
this
business
about
whether
trading
stamps
do
or
don't
cut
prices.
it's
been
decided
by
the
highest
courts
in
california,
in
pennsylvania.
i
would
say
in
new
jersey,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
trading
stamps
do
not
have
the
effect
of
cutting
price
because
they
are
a
method
of
giving
a
discount
for
the
payment
of
cash
and
a
discount
for
the
payment
of
cash
relates
to
the
terms
of
sales
and
doesn't
alter
the
price.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes,
but
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
what
the
frame
of
reference
is
when
they
made
this
attack
that
they
made.
now,
they
knew
about
that
body
of
the
law.
they
knew
in
addition
to
that
that
the
attorney
general
of
oklahoma
in
an
opinion
in
1950
when
asked
whether
or
not
trading
stamps
given
with
--
in
the
--
in
the
dry
cleaning
business
have
the
effect
of
violating
the
price
minimums
established
there.
they
knew
that
the
attorney
general
had
ruled
that
trading
stamps
do
not
have
the
effect
of
cutting
prices.
on
top
of
that,
they
knew
when
they
started,
when
they
cut
here
in
this
--
this
case,
they've
been
all
through
it.
just
six
weeks
before,
they'd
had
their
noses
rubbed
in
it
and
still
they
came
back
and
cut
prices.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
all
right.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
let
me
come
to
that.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
now,
what
we're
coming
down
to
now
is,
could
--
can
the
state
make
a
distinction
between
trading
stamps
and
discounts
for
cash
in
cash
for
example.
i
would
love
to
talk
about
that
in
mr.
clark's
argument.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
not
only
can
but
they
did
in
this
case
and
the
distinction
is
sustained
by
the
record.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
don't
think
that
they
did
for
that
reason.
i
wouldn't
say
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
what
was
in
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
their
mind.
i
can't
say
but
i
wouldn't
pin
the
label
on
for
that
reason.
now,
may
i
come,
your
honors
to
what
the
question
is,
that
was
in
fact
presented
here.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
not
a
single
point.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
not
at
all.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no.
no,
your
honor,
but
the
point
is
that
mr.
clark
says
that
the
net
to
price
was
to
take
a
3%
discount
for
example.
he
says
that
safeway
can
cut
a
dollar
item
to
97
cents
and
that
what
it's
done
is
to
give
a
cash
discount.
no,
i
say
that's
not
a
cash
discount.
a
discount
for
cash
is
something
that's
done
for
cash,
not
to
sell
tomatoes.
if
you
mark
tomatoes
down
from
a
dollar
to
97
cents,
you
haven't
given
a
discount.
you've
have
cut
the
price
three
cents
for
the
safeway
who
wanted
to
adopt
its
own
cash
discount
system
in
cash.
it
could
say
we're
in
the
cash
business,
we
want
to
encourage
cash
trade
in
order
to
encourage
cash
trade,
we
will
give
a
discount
of
2%
in
cash
and
then
when
the
housewife
comes
through
the
check
out
counter,
if
she
has
a
$10.00
charge
to
pay,
they
give
her
back
20
cents
and
there's
nothing
under
this
injunction
or
under
this
law
which
would
forbid
it,
but
that's
quite
definitely
not
what
safeway
did.
what
safeway
did
was
to
take
two-page
ads
and
say,
who
is
selling
tomatoes
at
97
cents
when
it
knew
that
everybody
else
was
selling
them
at
a
dollar
and
that's
what
started
the
price
war
and
that's
why
trading
stamps
are
so
different
from
what
safeway's
price
cuts
were
and
that's
why
we
say
there's
a
perfectly
valid
distinction
between
how
safeway's
practices
should
be
treated
under
this
law
and
how
the
trading
stamps
should
be
treated
under
this
law
and
please
bear
in
mind
that
trading
stamps
had
been
used
in
oklahoma
for
45
years
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
at
all
that
they
ever
provoked
a
price
war
in
oklahoma
nor
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
sustain
mr.
clark's
statement
that
there
was
“a
brisk
trade
war
provoked
by
the
trading
stamps
at
the
time
this
litigation
began.”
the
price
war
that
was
provoked
was
provoked
by
safeway's
price
cuts
and
not
by
the
trading
stamps.
all
was
peaceful
before
the
price
cuts.
now,
may
i
really
try
to
emphasize
what
the
question
was
--
that
was
presented
in
the
answer
to
the
petition.
paragraph
9
which
appears
on
page
56
of
the
record
and
this
is
a
petition
for
the
injunction.
the
question
raised
had
to
do
with
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
has
--
something
that
just
crept
in
there
but
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
is
that
when
issue
was
joined,
so
far
as
due
process
and
equal
protection
or
any
federal
question
is
concerned,
it
was
pitched
solely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
then
when
the
safeway
lost
in
the
trial
court
and
petition
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
as
appears
from
page
4,
paragraph
21
of
the
record,
again,
it
was
only
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
and
no
other
federal
question.
then
when
safeway
lost
in
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
and
petitioned
for
a
rehearing
the
record
shows
at
page
648
and
649,
the
assignments
of
--
of
the
petition
in
error
again
speaks
only
of
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendments.
then
when
the
safeway
company
came
here
in
its
notice
of
appeal
which
appears
on
pages
693,
694
and
695,
there
are
four
grounds
or
sub-grounds
in
paragraph
iii
for
appealing
to
this
court
and
in
each
case,
the
appeal
is
for
violation
of
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
finally,
when
you
come
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
again
it's
only
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
said
to
present
a
federal
question.
now,
in
this
court,
in
the
--
in
the
brief
in
this
court,
safeway
now
claims
that
there
is,
a
question
of
the
federal
supremacy,
presented.
i
suppose
really
now
that
i've
reached
this
point
that
is
perhaps
carrying
coals
to
newcastle
to
argue
the
non-availability
of
a
federal
question
not
raised
in
the
state
court
and
not
preserved
in
the
notice
of
appeal
and
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
but
even
at
the
risk
of
carrying
some
coals
to
newcastle,
i
would
suggest
that
in
mcgoldrick
against
compagnie
generale
transatlantique,
309
u.s.
430,
which
i
am
embarrassed
to
say
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief
contains
the
complete
answer
to
the
attempt
to
raise
in
this
court
a
question
which
was
never
presented
nor
litigated
in
the
state
court
having
been
present
at
the
trial.
i
can
assure
this
court
that
there
wasn't
a
word
of
oral
argument
on
that
point
nor
was
there
a
written
word
in
any
of
the
briefs
and
you
will
search
in
vain
through
the
record
to
find
that
the
federal
supremacy
question
was
ever
raised
at
all
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
why
this
court
should
not
attempt
to
pass
upon
a
federal
question
not
raised
in
the
court
below
is
pretty
obvious
that
the
state
court
should
have
its
own
opportunity
to
so
construe
its
statute
as
to
bring
it
within
constitutional
requirements
before
this
court
should
attempt
itself
to
pass
upon
it
and
in
the
mcgoldrick
against
the
compagnie
generale
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
309
u.s.430
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
the
rule
was
cited
as
follows.i
paraphrase
it.
“in
an
appeal
to
this
court
from
a
three-man
federal
court,
the
appellee
may
sustain
for
judgment
which
he
secured
below
on
additional
ground,
not
raised
below.
the
appellant
may
do
so
in
extraordinary
cases.”
i
don't
know
what
the
extraordinary
cases
would
be,
but
on
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
court
of
last
resort
of
a
state,
neither
the
appellee
to
support
his
judgment
nor
the
appellant
to
attack
it.
they
refer
to
federal
questions
not
raised
in
the
lower
court.
if
--
am
i
out
of
order
by
suggesting
that
there
are
other
cases
not
mentioned
in
the
brief
which
i
could
give
you
just
very
quickly
that
you
might
like
to
look
at
on
that
same
point
such
as
new
york
ex
rel.
cohn
against
graves
which
is
in
300
u.s.
308,
lynch
against
new
york
ex
rel.
pierson
in
293
u.s.
52.
i
think
there's
no
doubt
on
the
rule
and
since
i
believe
it
so
strongly,
i
won't
take
any
further
time
with
it
unless
the
court
wishes
it.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
federal
supremacy
question
had
not
been
raised
below
on
the
--
it
would
not
be
available
here.
in
their
reply
brief,
the
--
appellant
suggests
that
the
federal
supremacy
question
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction
and
since
jurisdiction
can
never
be
waived,
then
this
federal
question
of
supremacy
is
always
available.
i
don't
think
it
needs
extended
argument
to
indicate
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
question.
this
is
merely
a
federal
question,
the
same
as
all
the
federal
questions
presented
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
therefore,
not
having
been
raised
below,
nor
preserved
here,
need
not
be
considered.
feeling
as
strongly
as
i
do
about
that,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
i
should
take
much
of
any
of
the
court's
time
on
arguing
the
merits
of
the
federal
supremacy
question,
which
is
sought
to
be
raised,
i
think
stated
in
a
nutshell,
the
contention
that
is
made
on
this
ground
by
the
appellant
is
that
since
the
federal
government
has
itself
antitrust
laws
and
other
laws
regulating
business
practices
that
the
federal
government
has
pre-empted
the
entire
field.
if
that
was
so,
in
the
case
of
the
antitrust
laws,
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
question
would
have
been
tested
long
since
in
such
cases
as
the
waters-pierce
oil
company
against
the
texas
in
1909
or
more
recently
in
tigner
against
texas
or
in
parker
against
brown.
but
the
state
antitrust
laws
and
the
federal
antitrust
laws
have
existed
side-by-side
or
i
suppose
now,
nearly
70
years
and
it's
apparent
that
the
state
antitrust
laws
and
here,
the
state
sales
below
cost
laws
seek
the
same
objectives
and
supplement
one
another.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
among
the
recent
cases
in
this
court,
the
one
that
provoked
the
--
the
most
--
the
sharpest
split
in
this
court
was
rice
against
santa
fe
which
had
to
do,
as
you
will
recall,
on
whether
or
not,
the
warehouse
receipts
act
has
amended
using
the
word,
“exclusive”
in
the
amendment
was
intended
--
supplied
all
the
state
acts.
and
there,
there
was
--
you
--
i
realize
a
--
a
split,
but
there
has
been
no
court
--
no
decisions
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
government,
through
its
antitrust
laws
or
through
the
robinson-patman
act,
have
pre-empted
this
entire
field.
and
since,
there's
nothing
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
regulation
or
pure
food
and
drug
law
or
anything
of
that
kind
that
requires
a
central
and
uniform
and
exclusive
administration
from
a
practical
point
of
view.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
merits,
there's
nothing
to
this
preemption
question
either
and
so
i
will
draft
it
without
more
ado.
now,
having
disposed
of
that
question,
i
hoped
satisfactorily
on
the
federal
supremacy,
you
might
suppose
that
i
would
now
come
to
the
question
of
the
possible
or
the
alleged
violation
of
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
there
is
still
another
hurdle
over
which,
i
think,
this
appellant
does
not
get.
there
is
a
procedural
obstacle
to
the
appeal
here
which
it
seems
to
me,
should
cut
off
the
consideration
of
any
federal
question
before
you
arrive
at
it.
the
state
court
--
the
trial
court,
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court,
held
that
the
remedy
in
such
a
case
is
this,
was
to
apply
for
an
injunction
and
that
remedy
was
speedy,
inadequate
and
complete.
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
law
is
well
settled.
but
since
this
judgment
can
rest
upon
a
non-federal
adequate
basis,
then
this
court
should
not
go
into
the
federal
question
which
is
sought
to
be
raised.
if
your
honors
would
look
at
pages
636
and
637
of
the
records,
you
will
find
the
supreme
court's
discussion
of
the
subject
which
is
very
pointed.
in
considering
unfair
sales
practice
acts
from
a
procedural
viewpoint,
commentators
have
observed
the
wisdom
of
the
legislatures
in
providing
the
remedy
by
injunction
and
the
increasing
tendency
of
the
courts
to
enjoin
that
the
suit
of
competitors,
repeated
violations
affecting
the
unfair
conduct
of
business.
availability
of
the
injunction
remedy
and
that
of
interlocutory
decrees
based
on
actions,
therefore,
precludes
the
practice
endorsed
in
by
many
fair-minded
competitors
immediately
to
meet
competition
by
resorting
to
the
same
practice
itself.
since
actions
for
injunctions
maybe
filed
by
a
trade
association
for
the
benefit
of
all
its
members,
the
practice
of
resorting
to
the
same
practices
to
meet
competition
is
materially
reduced.
that
is
the
practice
of
meeting
cut
by
cut
in
the
marketplace
is
materially
reduced.
well
the
natural
restraint
against
suing
a
competitor
is
less
present
in
the
seeking
of
immediate
relief
against
threatened
heretical
price
was.
and
then
the
court
says
specifically,
“we
are
of
the
opinion
that
this
injunction
granted
by
the
trial
court
against
safeway,
was
proper
because
under
our
statute,
the
appropriate
remedy
was
by
an
injunction
and
not
by
retaliation
or
retaliatory
action
such
as
was
practiced
by
safeway."
in
this
respect,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
affirmed.
this
court
so
far
as
i
know
in
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
of
which
one
of
the
leading
is
murdock
against
memphis,
decided
in
1874
and
coming
on
down
through
fox
film
against
muller,
in
1935,
has
consistently
held
that
where
there
was
in
fact,
an
adequate,
independent,
non-federal
grounds
upon
which
to
base
the
judgment,
this
court
will
not
disturb
it,
because
there
was
a
federal
question.
i
would
suppose
that
an
exception
to
that
would
be
whether
the
federal
question
was
a
controlling
question.
or
--
but
the
rule
is
as
i
have
--
i
think,
stated
it
and
i
take
a
certain
delight
in
pointing
out
that
in
mccoy
against
shaw,
state
auditor,
in
1928,
the
attorney
who
prevailed
on
this
very
issue
was
mr.
v.
p.
crowe
whose
name
leads
all
the
rest
on
the
appellant's
brief
in
this
court
here.
this
then
brings
me,
at
last,
to
the
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
and
equal
protection.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
a
state
or
reasons,
which
seem
adequate
to
its
legislature
determined
that
there
is
a
--
an
economic
vise
in
loss-leader
merchandising,
it
is
for
that
state
alone,
to
decide
that
question
of
policy
and
not
for
this
court
to
disturb
it.
the
state
legislature,
of
course,
in
exercising
that
power
must
do
so
in
a
way
which
is
not
arbitrary
or
--
and
--
and
when
in
the
enforcement
of
the
statute,
it
must
also
enforce
it
in
a
way
which
is
not
arbitrary.
i
heard
your
honors
speaking
this
morning
about
the
(inaudible)
case.
that's
the
latter
situation,
of
course.
now,
you
take
this
particular
type
of
legislation,
it's
not
new.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
south
carolina
had
this
type
of
statute
as
long
ago
as
1902.
most
of
the
current
statutes,
however,
were
originated
during
the
hard
times
of
the
early
1930s
and
they
all
follow
a
pretty
consistent
pattern,
and
they've
been
tested
repeatedly
in
the
highest
courts
of
their
respective
states
that
passed
those
laws,
unlike
this
one,
they
all
forbid
sales
below
cost.
then
because
it
is
so
difficult,
mechanically,
i
assume
or
administratively
to
ascertain
what
proportion
of
overhead
should
rest
upon
each
particular
item
sold.
these
statutes
have
a
built-in
cost
formula
which
is
that
cost
you
can
now
call
it
statutory
cost,
is
invoice
or
replacement
cost
plus
transportation,
plus
cottage,
plus
taxes,
plus
an
arbitrary
6%,
unless
the
person
accused
of
violating
the
act
can
prove
that
in
fact
his
cost
was
less
than
6%.
and
in
each
of
these
statutes,
it
is
provided
that
a
competitor
can
meet
--
a
competitor,
in
good
faith,
can
meet
the
prices
of
his
competitor,
but
sometimes
that
is
couched
a
little
differently
than
others.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
state
had
wished,
it
could
have
enacted
such
a
statute
saying
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
sell
below
cost
where
the
effect
alone
is
to
injure
competition.
but
actually,
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
felt
that
it
couldn't
sustain
such
a
statute
because
it
has
criminal
penalties,
a
misdemeanor
to
violate
the
statute.
and
so,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
required
that
for
a
violation
of
this
statute,
the
sales
should
be
with
the
intent
and
purpose
of
ensuring
competition.
other
states
had
held
otherwise
on
that,
at
least
one
had
and
it
seems
to
me
too
that
under
section
2
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
there's
no
requirement
for
a
wrongful
intent.
now,
my
opponent
argues
vigorously
that
there's
something
wrong
about
this
statute
because
he
says,
“this
statute
permits
me
to
--
only
to
meet
the
prices
of
my
competitors
who
are
selling
at
cost.”
and
he
says,
“since
the
statute
or
a
violation
requires
a
wrongful
intent,
perhaps
my
competitor
would
be
selling
below
cost,
but
with
pure
motives
and
therefore,
his
sale
is
legal
and
i
can't
meet
it.”
now,
answer
number
one,
if
the
legislature
of
oklahoma
wanted
so
to
provide
whether
we
think
that
it's
a
wise
thing
or
not,
i
say
that
they
could
so
provide.
answer
number
two
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
they
could
provide
that
a
competitor
that
is
not
--
that
they
could
provide
that
you
can
only
meet
the
lawful
prices
of
your
--
you
can
only
meet
the
price
of
your
competitors
selling
at
cost.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
mean
the
situation
which
--
yes,
but
they
don't
say
--
or
what
the
situation
of
which
safeway
complains
is,
we
are
allowed
--
we
are
permitted
to
meet
our
competitor
only
so
long
as
he
is
selling
at
his
cost.
i
say
that
that
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
if
they
so
provided
it.
that
would
be
for
the
state
to
decide
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
it
--
it
is
purely
a
practical
question.
what
happens
in
--
in
fact
is
that
you
get
tremendous
buying
organizations
like
the
big
chains
and
because
of
their
purchasing
power.
you
know
that
they're
buying
it
--
when
they
sell
at
cost,
that's
probably
been
arrived,
then
the
other
independents
who
compete
with
them,
form
buying
associations
like
iga.
and
they
buy
through
the
association
which
polices
prices,
checks
them
all
the
time
and
sends
them
weekly
or
one
--
perhaps
more
frequently.
i
don't
know
a
list
of
what
the
prices
are
at
cost.
but
when
you've
been
in
the
grocery
businesses,
these
people
--
or
have
been
all
their
lives,
they
know
within
reasons
when
an
opponent
--
a
competitor
is
selling
below
cost
in
violation
to
the
statute.
what
they
do
is
they
call
the
secretary
of
the
grocers
association
and
say,
“charlie
is
going
below
again.”
and
he
calls
charlie
out
and
puts
him
back
in
line.
that's
the
way
it
works
in
practice.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
oh,
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
was
thinking
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
think
so
and
that
seems
to
me
that
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
that
they
refer
to
some
statutes
in
existence
today.
and
of
course,
the
question
that
your
honor
raises
has
been
raised
many
times
in
the
state
courts
on
that
very
subject
and
where
it
has
been
raised.
it's
been
held
that
it's
within
reason
and
constitutes
no
such
uncertainty
as
to
void
the
statutes.
the
second
answer
to
this
is
that
the
question
as
to
whether
safeway
can,
in
good
faith,
meet
the
cost
--
meet
the
price
of
a
competitor
who
is
selling
below
cost
in
good
faith,
had
never
been
litigated.
it
wasn't
raised
here.
it
wasn't
considered
here.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
should
be
considered
in
this
court
now.
surely,
when
that
question
arises,
it
will
be
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
in
oklahoma
to
come
up
with
the
right
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
meet
it.
i
say
that
because
your
honors
will
search
the
record
in
vain
to
find
anything
that
indicates
that
any
of
the
prices,
which
safeway
said
it
was
meeting
here,
were
lawful
prices
below
cost.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
will
not
decide
constitutional
questions
on
hypothetical
issues.
one
of
the
cases
which
comes
to
my
mind
as
i
--
i
speak
of
this
is
a
case
i
think
it
came
up
from
oklahoma
or
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
recall
it.
but
i
think
it
was
oklahoma,
a
well-known
case,
nobel
state
bank
against
haskell,
you
will
remember
that
the
state
enacted
a
statute
which
assessed
a
1%
levy
on
the
average
annual
deposits
of
state
chartered
banks,
the
noble
state
bank.
this
was
to
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
this
was
to
--
your
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
the
(inaudible)
--
well,
it
was
a
famous
case
and
judge
holmes
wrote
the
opinion
and
it
--
and
he
said,
“as
to
your
argument
about
what's
going
to
happen
when
the
state
says
that
each
grocer
must
contribute
1%
to
ensure
the
solvency
of
his
fellow
grocers,
we'll
decide
that
case
when
we
come
to
it.”
and
this
court,
in
yazoo
&
mississippi
railroad
against
jackson
vinegar
company,
in
226
u.s.
had
before
it,
a
state
statute
which
visited
a
penalty
of
$25
upon
any
railroad
which
didn't
settle
its
damage
claims
for
property
shipped
within
60
days.
and
in
the
case
in
question,
the
jackson
vinegar
company
recovered,
i
forgot
what
it
was,
$7
or
$8
for
loses
plus
$25
penalty.
the
railroad
said,
“but
what's
going
to
happen
when
an
unjust
claim
is
presented
and
we
have
to
settle
that
within
25
--
within
60
days?"
this
court
said,
"when
that
situation
arises,
it
will
be
time
enough
for
us
to
consider
it."
but
it
wasn't
presented
in
this
case.
and
so
i
say
to
your
honors
in
this
case,
the
plea
which
is
made
over
and
over
and
over
again
by
the
appellant
that
something
is
wrong
here
because
the
appellant
was
not
committed
under
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
meet
the
lawful
below
cost
prices
of
its
competitors.
it
is
not
presented
here
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
reason,
the
first
reason
is
that
it
was
never
raised.
the
second
reason
was
that
the
facts
show
that
the
prices
that
it
was
trying
to
meet,
or
said
it
was
trying
to
meet
were
unlawful.
and
the
third
reason
is
that
it
was
found
as
a
fact
that
the
appellant
was
not
proceeding
in
good
faith.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
what
is
it?
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
don't
know
whether
you
do,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
do,
and
i
think
that
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
that's
a
distinction
which
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
valid
one
but
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
but
i
have
never
seen
it
rose.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
what
i
said,
i'd
--
i'll
say
better,
perhaps.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
let
me
go
back
and
give
it
to
you
straight.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
when
the
statute
was
first
enacted,
it
said
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
sell
below
cost
with
the
intent
or
effect
of
injuring
competition.
the
state
supreme
court
said,
“nobody
can
tell
here,
whether
it's
a
violation,
where
there's
no
bad
intent,
but
there
is
in
effect.
and
since
this
has
criminal
penalties,
there
must
be
a
criminal
intent.”
and
hence,
they
voided
the
statute
and
it
was
immediately
reenacted
and
the
worded
phrase
was
changed
to
intent
and
purpose.
and
under
this
question
of
fact
here,
the
intent
and
purpose
was
in
fact
found
against
safeway.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
hope
i've
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
then
i
make
to
say
very
quickly
if
i
--
i
may.
so
far
as
due
process
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
well
within
the
power
of
the
state
legislature
to
enact
this
type
of
legislation.
so
far
as
equal
protection
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
valid
ground
to
complain
the
statute
defects
everybody
in
this
business
equally,
the
things
of
which
safeway
complains
this
business
about
meeting
the
lawful
law
of
price
of
a
competitor.
safeway
can
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
oh,
yes,
i
would.
because
morey
and
doud
had
a
perfectly
legitimate
--
i
think
morey
and
doud
showed
a
statute
which
is
very
ineptly
drawn.
in
the
morey
and
doud
situation,
the
state
of
illinois
said,
“you
must
do
this
and
this
and
this
and
this
and
pay
a
license
fee
and
submit
the
annual
inspection
and
put
up
a
bond
unless
your
name
is
american
express
postal
telegraph
or
western
union.”
on
this
case,
the
statute
doesn't
refer
to
anybody
at
all,
not
even
the
grocers,
anybody
in
the
retail
business
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
is
equally
covered
by
this
law
and
there
are
no
exceptions
to
it
at
all.
thank
you
very
much.
