mr.
ramsey
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
a
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
last
october.
it
involves
the
unfair
sales
act
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
it's
the
first
such
act
that
has
come
before
this
court
for
review.
it
is
also
the
only
unfair
sales
act
among
the
31
in
existence
in
the
united
states
and
the
various
states
today
that
treats
the
right
to
meet
competition
as
it
is
here
treated.
this
statute
was
originally
the
act
in
1941.
it
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
in
1949
and
before
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
had
become
final
in
less
than
35
days,
the
new
act
had
gone
to
the
legislature
and
had
been
passed
removing
the
particular
objections
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
have
had.
in
that
course
to
the
legislature
in
a
period
of
35
days,
there
was
added
a
new
type
of
meeting
competition
defense.
under
the
statute,
a
--
an
offense
involves
three
elements,
a
sale
below
cost,
the
intent
on
the
part
of
the
seller
by
that
sale
to
damage
competition
and
the
effect
on
competition
by
that
sale
of
damaging
competition
and
the
market
and
competitors
in
the
market.
the
“meeting
competition”
defense
in
this
statute
says
that
you
shall
have
the
right
to
meet
a
competitor
selling
at
his
cost
or
above.
it
does
not
say
that
you
can
meet
the
lawful
price
of
a
competitor.
it
does
not
say
that
you
can
meet
legal
competition.
every
other
unfair
sales
act
permits
specifically
the
meeting
of
lawful
competition,
legal
prices
or
the
unqualified
meeting
of
competition.
this
statute
alone
prohibits
the
meeting
of
competition
that
is
selling
below
its
cost.
about
a
year
after
the
re-enactment
of
the
unfair
sales
act,
another
condition
in
the
market
came
into
being
which
created
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
trading
stamps,
which
will
be
described
more
fully
here
and
after,
arrived
on
the
scene
in
oklahoma.
in
1952,
sperry
&
hutchinson,
the
large
--
the
largest
trading
stamp
company
in
the
world
had
only
two
accounts
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
by
1954,
the
time
at
which
this
case
was
filed,
over
100
different
merchants,
some
with
numbers
of
stores
were
giving
--
were
getting
trading
stamps
in
connection
with
sales
of
groceries
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
thus
the
statute
created
two
problems,
for
the
merchants
in
oklahoma.this
case
was
admittedly
a
test
case
to
answer
these
two
questions.
the
questions
were
generally,
when
under
this
statute
can
the
right
to
meet
competition
prevail
and
what
can
a
merchant
do
to
meet
the
competition
of
trading
stamps
given
by
a
competitor
in
connection
with
his
sales
at
cost.
now,
very
briefly,
what
happened
is
this.
in
the
summer
of
1954,
the
retail
grocery
competition
in
the
state
quickened.
prior
to
that
time
the
--
the
no
injunction
suit
--
only
one
injunction
suit,
excuse
me
only
one
injunction
suit
has
ever
been
brought
under
this
act.
it's
been
on
the
books
for
three
years.
in
1954,
competition
quickened
in
the
cities
of
shawnee,
enid,
norman
and
tulsa,
competitors
of
this
appellant
commenced
selling
below
their
cost,
their
statutory
cost.
now,
statutory
cost
is
not
the
cost
in
the
usual
connotation.
it
is
invoice
cost
plus
incidentals
to
placing
the
goods
in
the
store
such
as
taxes,
transportation
and
carriage
plus
a
proportionate
part
of
the
doing
--
of
the
cost
of
doing
business,
which
is
set
by
the
statute
at
6%
for
the
cost
of
doing
business,
in
the
absence
of
proof
of
a
different
policy
of
doing
business.
so,
under
any
circumstances
cost
under
the
statute
is
6%
above
the
cost
to
the
grocer
of
putting
the
merchandise
on
his
shelf
for
sale.
in
oklahoma
city,
a
brisk
trading
stamp
war
erupted
and
there
were
numerous
instances
by
trading
stamp
merchants
at
which
they
gave
trading
stamps
in
connection
with
sales
made
at
their
statutory
cost.
in
this
connection,
the
record
shows
no
variation
from
this
rule,
the
traffic
items
and
the
grocery
stores
which
are
those
that
handful
of
items
perhaps
50
out
of
7500
up
to
10,000
different
items
sold
by
the
store,
the
traffic
items,
the
staples,
the
items
the
housewife
buy
each
week.
the
items
that
the
housewife
has,
the
most
consciousness
at
the
prices
on,
were
being
sold
by
the
merchants
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
at
identical
prices.
the
trading
stamp
merchants
envision
thereto,
were
giving
trading
stamps
in
connection
with
these
sales.
appellant,
safeway
stores,
reduced
its
prices
to
meet
this
competition.
it
was
enjoined
by
the
oklahoma
retail
grocers
association.
it
was
sued
for
an
injunction
and
subsequently
enjoined
from
selling
below
cost
in
violation
of
the
act.
appellant
filed
a
cross
action.
originally
the
cross
action
involve
all
of
the
retail
grocers
in
the
association.
by
stipulation
it
was
later
agreed
that
only
louie
speed
would
be
involved,
louie
speed
being
a
stamp-giving
merchant.
louie
speed
in
two
of
his
stores
sold
strictly
for
cash
no
credit
sales.
it
was
stipulated
and
the
record
shows
without
equivocation
that
every
price
violation
charged
to
safeway
was
sent
to
meet
competition
and
was
equal
to
prices
set
by
that
competition.
as
to
the
trading
stamps,
the
appellant
calculated
their
value
by
an
exhaustive
survey
and
reduced
its
prices
to
meet
the
price
at
which
each
competitor
sold
that
commodity
less
the
value
of
the
trading
stamps.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
believe
there
are
28.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
only
--
only
in
the
market.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
in
what
--
in
what
was
considered
to
be
the
trade
area
of
that
competitive
store.
in
other
words,
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
that
indicates
that
they
would
use
a
price
of
a
competitor
to
reduce
prices
statewide.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
they
did
this
before
they
reduced
any
prices.
first,
they
notified
the
secretary
and
manager
of
the
oklahoma
retail
grocers
association
that
this
particular
store
out
here
was
selling
at
what
appeared
to
be
below
cost
and
that
if
it
did
not
raise
its
prices
to
cost,
it
would
be
necessary
for
safeway
to
meet
that
price.in
a
number
that
you
see
there's
the
manager,
the
secretary
and
the
manager
of
this
association
testified
that
competitor
raised
its
prices
back
to
the
statutory
price,
cost
of
price.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
has
held
that
trading
stamps
constitute
merely
and
solely
a
discount
for
cash
and
did
not
have
the
effect
to
reducing
price.
despite
the
fact
that
these
merchants
were
not
selling
for
credit,
they
were
selling
only
for
cash.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
evidence
at
the
trial
level
was
uniform
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
cash
discount
in
a
retail
sale
between
the
whole
seller
and
the
retail,
between
the
manufacture
and
the
whole
seller,
yes.
but
the
retail
grocery
industry
knows
no
cash
discount.
now,
there
are
certain
exemptions
to
that
in
the
record,
apparently.
however,
the
record
is
clear
and
it
is
stipulated
that
most
stamp
merchants
sold
strictly
for
cash,
in
which
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
it's
entirely
fictitious.
if
you
don't
sell
for
credit
how
can
you
give
a
--
an
incentive
to
buy
for
cash?
in
addition
to
this,
they
made
surveys
which
show
that
trading
stamps
were
creating
a
drastic
diversion
of
their
trade.
the
surveys
appear
in
the
appendixes
to
the
record
here.
they
reduced
prices
on
over
200
non-traffic
items.
they
did
not
reduce
these
prices
below
cost
and
they
advertised
extensively
saying
we
have
reduced
prices
on
200
items
and
they
listed
the
prices
and
they
found
that
these
did
not
offset
the
value
of
the
trading
stamps.
these
prices
were
not
below
cost.
there's
no
question
of
the
violation
of
the
act
in
reducing
these
prices.
they
made
purchases
at
prices
and
the
stores
of
their
competitors
that
they
met
and
they
had
their
people
go
into
the
store
and
make
the
purchase
to
ascertain
for
sure
that
this
is
the
price
at
which
the
commodity
was
being
sold.
in
the
case
of
the
--
of
the
trading
stamp,
they
took
the
cash
register
receipt,
the
commodity
and
the
trading
stamps
and
calculated
the
price.
it
was
from
the
beginning
clearly
designed
to
be
a
test
case
to
test
these,
the
rights
to
meet
competition
if
they
arise
or
to
the
extent
that
they
arise
under
the
statute.
now,
everyone
at
the
trial
level,
ever
quits
in
the
grocery
industry
to
testify
agreed
that
a
retail
grocer
cannot
stay
in
business
unless
he
can
meet
the
price
of
his
competitors
on
traffic
items
and,
too,
the
people
who
testified
to
that
were
none
other
than
the
president
of
the
oklahoma
retail
grocers
association,
who
specifically
said
you
go
out
of
business
if
you
don't
meet
the
price
of
the
competitor
on
these
traffic
items
and
the
treasurer
of
that
association
who
said
the
same
thing.
now,
the
trial
court
after
about
a
three-day
hearing
enjoined
appellant
from
selling
below
its
cost
to
meet
the
price
of
a
merchant
selling
below
his
cost
and
from
reducing
its
price
below
cost
to
meet
the
value
of
trading
stamps
refused
to
enjoin
the
appellee
who
was
giving
the
trading
stamps
from
the
continuance
of
that
practice.
the
supreme
court
affirmed
this
ruling
by
the
trial
court.
it
said
that
safeway
could
not
justify
its
below
cost
price
on
competitors
below
cost
price.
with
that
regard
to
whether
competitor's
below
cost
price
was
lawful
or
unlawful.
if
that
competitor's
price
was
below
cost,
below
cost
of
the
competitor,
it
could
not
be
met.
this
immediately
created
the
vacuum
that
competitor
could
be
selling
below
his
cost
for
a
lawful
purpose,
traffic
items,
a
few
meeting
or
if
safeway
met
him
now
under
this
injunction.
they
could
be
enjoined
by
the
very
--
very
person
whose
prices
they
remit.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
i'll
go
into
that
more
fully
later
on
but
that
--
that
is
the
basis
to
that,
yes
sir.
the
supreme
court
as
i
just
mentioned
further
said
that
trading
stamps
do
constitute
a
price
cut
--
did
not
have
the
--
the
effect
of
lowering
price
but
were
merely
a
discount
for
cash.
it
said
and
it
is
clear
in
the
record
that
the
sole
purpose
of
safeway
in
reducing
its
prices
was
to
meet
the
prices
of
its
competitors,
the
sole
purpose
that's
the
exact
language
of
the
court
below.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
that
is
right
with
the
exception
to
the
use
of
word
exactly
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
it's
not
quite
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes
to
the
best
of
their
ability,
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes.
and
there've
been
no
challenge
to
that.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
was
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
the
basis
of
proof
and
a
stipulation
at
the,
before
the
close
in
the
trial.
it
was
stipulated
that
trading
stamps,
single
trading
stamps
at
a
value
of
not
less
than
2.5%
not
less
than
that
on
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
and
on
double
stamp
they
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
matter
of
stipulation
in
the
record.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that's
on
page
200,
your
honor.
it's
also
exhibit
g.
i
missed
the
(inaudible)
as
they
sent
in
oklahoma
with
reading
this
stipulation
in
the
record
at
the
bottom
of
page
199
and
also
at
the
--
at
the
top
of
page
200.
it
said
speed,
that's
one
of
the
appellees,
they
gave
double
stamps
with
the
sale
of
such
items
and
on
every
other
day
of
the
week
gave
single
trading
stamps
with
the
minimum
priced
items.
if
the
stamps
valued
at
not
less
than
2.5%,
now
that's
the
single
stamps,
had
the
effect
of
reducing
the
sale
price
at
which
the
items
were
sold,
then
the
result
of
sales
prices
were
less
than
the
minimum
allowed
by
the
oklahoma
unfair
sales
act.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
yes,
that's
a
matter
of
tremendous
controversy.
the
department
of
agriculture,
the
department
of
--
of
labor
and
commerce
have
all
tried
to
ascertain
that.
i
believe
that
sperry
&
hutchinson
sales
96%
are
redeemed
and
about
the
lowest
figure
i've
seen
is
about
80%.
but
as
we
were
trying
to
show
them,
we
think
the
economic
conditions
in
this
country
show
trading
and
as
was
stated
by
counsel
for
s&h
stamps
at
trial
level.
trading
stamps
are
worth
far
more
as
a
competitive
device
than
their
actual
monetary
value.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
i
--
we
have
considered
that
a
number
of
the
district
of
colombia,
of
course,
forbids
trading
stamps
in
the
old
case
and
an
old
case,
1930
and
this
court
said
that
they
are
a
lure
to
the
impoverished.
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
should
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
mr.
ramsey
clark
they
have
--
i
know
this,
that
in
1957,
40
states
had
legislative
sessions
and
37
states
had
bills
either
outlawing
or
taxing
trading
stamps.
now,
under
the
fair
trade
laws
i
think
22
states
have
put
in
what
they
call
anti-concession
clauses
which
specifically
prohibit
you
from
giving
trading
stamps
in
connection
with
their
fair
traded
items.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
ordinary
trading
stamp
is
not
redeemable
for
cash.
there
is
nothing
in
this
injunction
here
which
prohibit
and
in
fact
the
injunction
permits
safeway
to
give
trading
stamps,
cash
register
receipts,
or
other
evidences
of
credit
to
meet
as
a
cash
discount,
is
what
they
say,
not
to
meet
competition
it's
a
cash
discount.
now,
cash
register
receipts
are
ordinarily
redeemed
in
either
cash
or
the
commodities
that
the
purchaser
is
giving
them
--
of
the
self
giving
them,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
record
shows
that
safeway
can
use
stamps
if
safeway
does
not
desire
to
use
stamps,
if
safeway
by
virtue
of
the
injunction
below
has
been
forced
to
use
stamps
since
the
effective
date
of
the
injunction
to
meet
competition.
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
think
that
if
a
state,
after
serious
legislative
study,
undertook
to
so
regulate
the
business
and
--
and
unless
they
could
show
some
policy
which
we
have
not
been
able
to
conceive,
we
don't
think
that
it
could
require
a
merchant
to
give,
in
addition
to
that
which
he
wishes
to
sell
something
else.
now,
ordinarily
these
trading
stamps
are
this
way,
70%
of
the
trading
stamp
industry
is
in
the
hands
of
10
companies.
they
are
tremendous
companies.
they
sell
their
stamps
by
books
which
under
contract,
to
various
merchants
over
the
country.
this
contract
requires
the
merchant
to
give
trading
stamps
to
the
costumers
as
they
make
purchases.
as
an
illustration
which
is
shown
clearly
in
this
record,
sperry
&
hutchinson
required
you
to
give
a
trading
stamp
for
this
ten
cents
of
purchase.
the
trading
stamp
is
worth
two
mills
or
rather
the
trading
stamp
costs
the
grocer
two
mills.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
a
merchant
giving
trading
stamps,
sperry
&
hutchinson
trading
stamps
which
predominate
in
this
record,
pays
2%
of
his
gross
sales
to
the
trading
stamp
company.
the
record
always
or
also
shows
and
it's
an
incredible
fact
that
that
is
twice
the
net
profit
of
the
industry
leaders.
that
is
twice
the
net
profit
of
the
industry
leaders.
there's
only
one
way
that
you
can
give
trading
stamps
and
make
money
on
them
and
that
is
to
increase
your
volume
tremendously,
ordinarily
about
33%,
i
think
sperry
&
hutchinson
figure
is
that
if
you
don't
increase
your
volume
20%
with
the
use
of
trading
stamps,
then
you're
going
to
lose
money
on
because
they‘re
costing
you
2%
of
your
gross
sales
and
in
this
--
in
this
grocery
industry,
you
don't
make
much
on
your
gross
sales.
i
think
there's
some
department
of
commerce
statistics
in
the
record
that
say
that
these
large
independent
supermarkets
make
about
2.5%
on
the
gross
sales,
but
a&p,
kroger,
safeway,
the
--
the
national,
the
big
chains
they
equate
in
26
states,
i
believe,
they
make
less
than
1%
ordinarily.
now,
four
justices
on
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
dissented.
i
said
they
dissented
on
the
trading
stamp
issue.
i
said
that
there's
--
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
you
can
give
a
cash
discount.
they
weren't
giving
a
cash
discount.
and
the
trading
stamps
have
--
have
other
purposes
anyway
and
that
they
in
any
effect
reduced
the
price
below
statutory
cost.
now,
as
construed
and
applied,
this
act
prohibits
absolutely
the
meeting
of
below
cost
prices
whether
they're
lawful
or
unlawful.
and
the
question
is,
this
first
question
is,
whether
this
so
--
so
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
as
to
violate
due
process.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
it
does
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
what,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
where
is
that
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well.
mr.
ramsey
clark
now
the
--
the
dilemma
that
safeway
faces
here
is
not
caused
by
the
statute.
it
is
caused
by
the
supreme
court's
decision
which
does
not
go
to
the
intention
of
the
legislature
but
says
merely
that
trading
stamps
as
a
matter
of
law
are
cash
discounts
and
do
not
reduce
prices.
this
is
not
a
thing
that
was
ever
before
the
legislature
or
ever
considered
by
the
legislature.
they
had
no
--
there's
nothing
about
trading
stamps
for
legislature.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
it
is
to
a
limited
degree.
certainly,
you
don't
become
involved
in
the
considerations
for
nebbia
v.
new
york
in
a
situation
like
that
--
like
this
where
justice
roberts
talked
a
great
length
about
the
legislative
history,
about
the
purpose,
the
emergency,
the
temporary
nature
of
the
--
of
the
thing.
mr.
ramsey
clark
with
--
with
the
qualification
and
as
i
tried
to
make
that
is
--
could
in
fact
in
our
brief
we
said
that
this
is
exactly
as
though
the
state
legislature
have
said
that
you
can
give
a
discount
for
cash
by
way
of
trading
stamps,
cash
register
receipts
or
other
evidences
of
credit
provided
that
you
cannot
give
one
in
any
other
way.
on
the
other
hand,
the
reason
--
the
reason
for
upholding
a
legislative
act,
the
reason
for
giving
validity
to
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature
is
because
it
has
not
acted
arbitrarily
but
it
has
exercised
its
discretion
and
here
you
have
no
exercise
of
discretion.
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
doesn't
contend
that
there
has
been
an
exercise
of
discretion,
an
attempt
to
meet
a
problem
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
this
is
merely
a
case
of
an
interpretation
of
the
state
and
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
without
any
legislative
investigation
or
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
study.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
an
effect
of
the
three.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
certainly
it
is.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
ramsey
clark
they
didn't
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
they
didn't
say
that
we
must
read
it
that
way.
they
said
that
this
is
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
cash
discount.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
--
i'm
certainly
glad
that
you
raised
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
we
have
been
operating
under
the
presumption
that
there
is
not.
in
its
brief,
for
the
first
time
to
my
knowledge,
after
at
least
i
have
said
that
there's
nothing
in
there
to
prevent
you
from
giving
a
cash
discount
in
cash.
now,
if
they
are
right,
they
have
two
peculiarities
about
the
situation.
first
of
all,
the
injunction
didn't
say
so.
the
injunction
said
only
this,
in
--
not
in
mandatory
language
but
in
specific
language
it
said,
“you
can
give
a
cash
discount
in
these
ways.
you
can
give
them
by
trading
stamps,
that
was
the
first
listed
by
cash
register
receipts
or
by
other
evidences
of
credit.
no
other
way.
no
other
way
it
was
mentioned
and
what
we
were
prohibited
from
doing
in
the
first
place
was
netting
our
price.
in
other
words,
instead
of
taking
a
dollar
on
a
purchase
of
10-pound
purchase
of
sugar,
we
netted
the
price
to
97
cents
or
98
cents.
we
set
the
price
at
the
competitor
price
less
the
value
of
trading
stamps.
now
the
question
is,
could
we
have
said
it
--
your
question
is,
under
the
injunction
can
we
sell
it
for
a
dollar
and
then
give
two
cents
back?
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
would
certainly
fear
contempt
of
court
if
we
did
that
because
we
were
enjoined
from
netting
in
the
first
place.
we
see
no
difference
at
all
between
the
two.
and
in
the
second
place,
we
were
told
that
we
can
give
cash
discounts
in
these
ways
and
those
ways
it
did
not
include
money.
there
--
there
is
further
a
--
there
was
an
effort
by
counsel
for
sperry
&hutchinson
at
the
--
at
the
trial
level
to
show
that
a
trading
stamps
had
an
advantage
over
a
return
of
cash.
they
were
trying
to
put
on
evidence
by
mr.
william
sperry
beinecke,
general
counsel
and
vice
president
of
sperry
&
hutchinson
trading
company
and
the
court
refused
yet
sustained
objections
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence.
mr.
lane
who
--
who
said
on
the
trial
court
that
he
was
there
on
behalf
of
sperry
&
hutchinson
and
who
will
argue
here,
said,
“i
would
like
to
show
for
the
record
what
mr.
beinecke,
general
counsel
and
vice
president,
my
company
would
have
said.”
and
on
page
375,
he
said,
“in
integrated
family
retail
accounts
they
--
speaking
of
trading
stamps
provide
an
inducement
which
a
discount
in
cash
purely
would
not
provide.
in
other
words
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
an
inducement
to
a
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
customer
to
come
here
and
buy
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
now
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
it's
relevant
to
this
problem.
mr.
ramsey
clark
at
that
time
we
were
talking
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
disagree,
it's
a
different
thing.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
correctly
state
our
position.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
ramsey
clark
there
is
a
difference
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
between
(inaudible)
cash
and
giving
a
trading
stamp.
mr.
ramsey
clark
not
the
money
differential.
no,
sir.
i
was
speaking
in
terms
of
returning
the
cash.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
would
not
meet
it
that
--
that
is
the
claim
that
the
sperry
&
hutchinson
make
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
that
is
ready.
mr.
ramsey
clark
they
now
say
that
we
can
do
that,
by
the
way.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
--
that
is
true.
the
question
is
if
you
want
to
put
it
on
the
legislative
level
whether
the
legislature
can
relegate
competition
to
the
area
of
trading
stamps.
who
gives
the
best
trading
stamps?
they
--
that
--
that
could
be
one
way
of
looking
at
the
question.
in
other
words
when
we
compete
in
a
retail
grocery
industry
in
oklahoma
for
now
on,
it's
not
where
you
can
get
the
most
for
money.
it's
where
you
can
get
the
best
trading
stamps.
that
is
the
area
of
competition.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
below.
i
definitely
think
it
is
below
this
court.
the
court
below
is
involved
within
--
with
the
interpretation
as
to
the
below-cost
provision
and
what
in
the
world
trading
stamps
are
as
to
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
trading
stamps.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
--
that
is
--
is
questionable.
i
don't
know
if
--
if
there
would
be
any
difference
between
the
two
cents
and
the
--
and
the
trading
stamps.
if
they
said
the
trade
--
that
the
two
cents
is
a
varied
discount
of
cash,
the
customer
in
a
way
of
giving
a
discount
of
cash
is
by
a
net
price,
although
there's
no
costumer
at
the
retail
level
because
there's
no
practice
at
the
retail
level.
that's
what
we
do.
we
get
--
if
--
if
it
could
be
said
that
this
is
meeting
cash
discounts
then
we
meant
a
person
giving
cash
discounts
by
giving
cash
discounts
in
the
customary
way
by
netting
the
price
not
by
giving
him
a
green
piece
of
paper.
now,
under
the
reasoning
of
justice
brandeis
in
--
in
the
oklahoma
ice
case
that
the
arbitrary
nature
of
a
statute
is
dependent
entirely
upon
the
relevant
facts
as
to
which
it
operates.
we
think
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
to
show
to
the
court
facts
as
to
trading
stamps
and
the
effect
of
trading
stamps.
what
they
have
done
and
what
they
are.
trading
stamps
are
an
incredible
phenomena
on
the
american
scene.
they
have
swept
through
the
retail
grocery
industry
and
other
industries.
the
retail
grocery
industry
in
1957
paid
two
trading
stamp
companies,
one
half
of
1%
of
its
gross
income.
30%
of
the
retail
brochures
in
the
united
states
were
found
by
the
department
of
agriculture
to
be
giving
trading
stamps
and
these
were
the
big
operators.
it
was
found
also
by
the
department
of
agriculture
that
the
giving
of
stamps
tended
to
hasten
the
elimination
policy
of
the
small
merchant
because
he
cannot
compete
with
the
stamps.
now,
here
are
some
examples
of
--
of
what
has
happened
in
the
trading
stamp
wars
that
have
been
created
across
the
country.
this
is
the
type
of
thing
that
a
legislature
would
have
to
consider.
this
is
the
type
of
the
--
of
thing
that
this
court
have
to
consider
in
determining
whether
there
is
something
unconstitutionally
arbitrary
about
the
imposition
on
the
retail
grocery
--
grocery
industry
in
oklahoma,
are
relegating
it
to
the
giving
of
trading
stamps
insofar
as
competition
is
concerned.
mr.
ramsey
clark
because
we
feel
that
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
demonstrably
irrelevant
to
any
purpose
that
the
legislature
could
have.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
the
--
that
is
certainly
the
effect
that
this
has
had
in
oklahoma
because
the
market
is
today
saturated
with
stamps
safeway
finds
that
all
of
its
competitors
are
giving
stamps
and
it
has
to
give
stamps.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
you
say
that
there's
no
difference
between
a
consideration
of
a
problem
by
the
legislature
and
the
--
the
capricious
effect
overruling
by
a
court
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
if
that
is
the
case,
then
we
have
come
along
way
from
nebbia
v.
new
york
where
we
--
where
the
very
--
the
very
life
of
the
opinion
was
based
upon
the
intensive
and
exhaustive
studies
made
of
the
milk
problem.
of
course,
that
was
only
milk
and,
of
course,
also
they
set
the
price
as
uniformly
on
milk.
one
person
didn't
sell
below
another
person
and
enjoined
the
other
person
for
meeting
it.
if
--
if
that
is
so,
then
--
then
we
have
come
a
long
way.
certainly,
there
is
nothing
like
that
indicated
in
the
opinion
nebbia
v.
new
york,
or
in
the
dissents
of
justice
stone
in
tyson
&
brother
v.
banton
or
justice
brandeis
in
the
liebmann
case,
the
oklahoma
ice
case.
here
are
some
illustrations
of
what
stamps
have
done
because
i'm
going
to
sit
down,
i
see
the
red
light
just
went
and
i've
reserved
20
minutes
and
will
sit
down
and
take
the
rest
of
my
time
later.
mr.
ramsey
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
first
several
items
i
would
like
to
make
specific
response
to.
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument,
counsel
for
appellee
stated
that
trading
stamp
had
been
the
bulwark
of
the
small
grocer.
i
think
this
goes
to
whether
this
is
arbitrary
or
unreasonable.
in
december
1958,
the
department
of
agriculture
issued
an
extensive
report
which
said
that
trading
stamps
definitely
appeared
to
be
hastening
to
decline
of
the
fall
of
the
small
food
store.
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics,
back
earlier,
had
made
an
exhaustive
survey
that
shows
that
42%
of
the
chains'
enlarged
independents
offered
stamps,
42%,
but
only
12%
of
the
small
independents.
of
course,
there
are
many
more
small
independents
than
there
are
large
and
the
percentage
is
--
is
much
smaller
as
to
them.
a
specific
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
the
reason
that
it
took
cost,
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
they
simply
cannot
afford
to
pay
2%
of
their
gross,
but
there's
a
(inaudible)
cost.
mr.
ramsey
clark
how
should
they
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
they
have
--
they
--
everybody
have
promotions.
they'll
give
you
a
kewpie
doll
or
they'll
give
a
--
have
a
raffle
and
send
somebody
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
i'm
sure
that
there
are
instances
aren't
there.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
the
rule.
i
think
it
is
the
exception.
now,
in
response
again
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
whether
you
can
return
money
as
a
discount,
we
will
say
that
we
are
under
an
injunction
that
states,
the
type
of
discount
that
we
can
give,
it
must
be
exclusive,
at
least
if
it
is
not
exclusive,
why,
there
is
only
one
place
that
we
can
find
that
out
and
that's
the
courts
of
oklahoma.
and
also
if
it
is
not
exclusive,
then
it
has
no
real
efficacy
or
meaning.
it's
just
in
the
injunction
that
it
is
dicta
that
says,
“by
the
way,
you
can
give
--
you
can
give
discounts
for
cash
in
the
form
of
trading
stamps,
cash
register
receipts
and
other
evidences
of
credit."
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
injunction
commences
on
page
--
the
injunctive
features
commence
on
page
450.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that's
--
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
where
it
will
be.
it's
the
second
paragraph
on
452.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
say
it
will
not
cover
cash.
i
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
say
that's
exclusive
and
we
cannot
give
cash.
now
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
would,
if
i
may
get
to
that
later.
mr.
ramsey
clark
this
--
the
statute,
this
statute
--
the
unfair
sales
act
permits
cash
discounts
between
a
wholesaler
and
a
retailer
and
between
a
manufacturer
and
a
wholesaler
or
retailer,
but
it
makes
no
reference
at
all.
that's
one
of
the
main
points
in
dissent.
it
makes
no
reference
at
all
to
a
cash
discount
at
the
retailer.what
is
--
from
the
retailer
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
that
may
claim
that
that
is
cost
to
the
retailer.
that's
the
retailer's
cost
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
and
not
his
price.
now,
the
discounts
that
we're
talking
about
are
discounts
that
the
retailer
gives.
mr.
ramsey
clark
not
that
the
retailer
receives.
these
had
reference
to
discounts
that
the
retailer
receives
from
his
wholesaler
or
the
manufacture
from
whom
he
orders
direct
would
prompt
payment
of
cash.
mr.
ramsey
clark
in
determining
his
cost
in
that.
now,
in
reference
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
as
to
the
bad
faith
finding
and
the
predicate
on
which
it
rests.
it
rests
simply
and
strictly
upon
two
things.
it
rests
upon
the
conclusion
of
judge
spellman,
the
trial
court
that
safeway
knew
when
it
met
these
prices
that
they
were
below
cost,
because
as
a
large
chain,
it
knew
that
it
could
buy
at
a
lower
price
or
as
lower
price
as
anyone
else.
that
does
not
mean
that
they
knew
they
were
meeting
an
unlawful
price
to
determine
which
they
would
have
to
know
the
intent
of
the
person
who
set
the
price
they
were
meeting
and
the
ultimate
effect
in
the
market
of
the
price
that
they
met.
the
other
basis,
the
other
predicate
for
that
finding
is
the
alternative
pleadings
of
safeway.
in
the
alternative,
if
we
cannot
meet
these
prices,
then
they
are
illegal
and
should
be
enjoined.
and
the
supreme
court
clearly
shows
that
in
its
opinion
because
it
said,
"for
the
sole
purpose
of
meeting
the
prices
of
its
competitors,
safeway
reduced
prices
to
levels
which
it
thought
--
going
back
to
judge
spellman,
were
below
cost."
now,
as
to
the
question
is
this
arbitrary,
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
and
the
ultimate
question
on
this
issue,
is
it
arbitrary,
why
should
the
housewives
of
oklahoma
and
buying
baby
food
be
required
to
pay
for
trading
stamps?
why
should
the
merchant
who
wants
to
sell
groceries,
who
is
in
the
grocery
business,
be
required
to
use
this
costly
device,
if
he
does
not
wished
to?
why
cannot
he
meet
it
in
the
competitive
marketplace?
this
is
the
very
thing,
the
very
thing
that
justice
stone
was
talking
about
in
his
descent
in
tyson
&
brother
v.
banton.
he
said,
"all
justifications
--
all
justifications
for
price
regulation
are
found
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
the
condition
priors
the
price
regulation
damaged
the
competitive
nature
of
the
market.
we
have
here
something
that
forecloses
the
competitive
nature
of
the
market
and
relegates
competition
in
the
market
to
trading
stamps.
and
we're
talking
about
the
retail
grocery
business.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
would
not,
sir.
it
would
not.
they
can
do
that.
they
don't
want
to
do
that
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
is
time
consuming
and
costly.
second
of
all,
you're
talking
about
hard
money
when
you
talk
about
giving
back
two
cents
on
the
dollar,
because
the
trading
stamp
companies
buy
at
wholesale
prices.
they
price
at
retail
prices
and
there's
a
tremendous
difference
in
there.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
he
could
be
given
cash
register
receipts
that
would
be
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
redeemable,
no.
that
would
be
redeemable
in
the
merchandise
of
the
store,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
because
we
have
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
we
are
limited
to
trading
stamps,
cash
register
receipts
and
other
evidences
of
credit,
not
to
credit,
not
to
cash.
we
can't
give
cash.
as
we
construe
this
injunction,
and
certainly,
that
was
the
level
of
the
argument
throughout
the
trial
court.
mr.
ramsey
clark
our
position
would
still
be
that
there
is
no
difference
between
giving
a
net
price
and
having
to
go
through
this
manipulation
because
somebody
else
wants
to
give
trading
stamps
and
we
want
a
meeting.
this
manipulation
of
calculating
cash
register
receipts
to
added
burden
to
the
store,
to
check
out
time
delays,
the
delay
at
the
stand.
we
had
--
we
might
have
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
didn't
do
it
when
we
found
ourselves
under
this
injunction
because
we
knew
that
we
could
give
trading
stamps
under
the
injunction
that
they
would
cost
us
less
and
be
more
effective
competitively.
people
like
trading
stamps
better
than
they
like
cash
register
receipts.
that's
how
i
experience
in
the
marketplace.
so,
it's
a
practical
aspect,
if
it's
a
nullity
meaning
the
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
would
say
it
would
probably
be
arbitrary
and
unreasonable.
i
don't
see
that
it
would
accomplish
any
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
i
think
they
could.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
would
make
no
rhyme,
no
reasons
in
our
experience
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
it's
arbitrary.
it's
supposed
to
make
reason.
if
it's
unreasonable,
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it's
this
matter
of
degree,
if
it
is
unreasonable
and
the
contention
of
the
constitution,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
must
be
stricken
down.
certainly,
there
is
no
such
stringent
price
fixing
by
any
state
anywhere
and
has
not
been
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
because
it
permits
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
it
certainly
did.
it
drove
us
to
trading
stamps
at
the
same
time,
everyday
in
oklahoma,
there
are
merchants
selling
below
cost.
we
cannot
meet
them.
we
cannot
enjoin
them.
that's
going
on
right
now.
mr.
ramsey
clark
they're
not
in
our
price.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
because
they
open
up
a
new
store
and
there
are
cases
on
this
and
they
say,
“this
is
a
new
store
promotion.
we're
trying
to
get
in
business.
it's
our
only
purpose.
we
have
no
purpose
of
harming
anybody.
this
will
not
have
any
effect.
they
can
hold
out
those
prices
down
for
three
months
and
draw
off
the
trademark
store,
we
can't
meet
them.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
it's
--
its
competition.
i
would
like
first
to
own
that
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
cash
register
receipt
in
the
trade
would
be
the
receipt
that
you
get
for
the
payment
of
groceries.
it
would
show
the
amount
of
cash
that
you
paid
and
the
items
would
be
rang
up
individually
on
there.
mr.
ramsey
clark
you
would
get
amount
of
bundle
and
when
you
get
so
many,
not
to
have
a
value
in
excess
of
3%
of
the
total
amount
of
those
cash
register
receipts
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
you
can
redeem
them
in
the
store
for
tomato
juice
or
whatever
you
want.
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
get
that
from
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
which
says
that
you
cannot
give,
except
evidences
of
credit,
cash
register
receipts
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
certainly
think
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
intention
of
the
injunction.
we
feel
that
is
a
matter
that
was
threshed
out
throughout
the
courts
of
oklahoma
and
we
feel,
we
know
clearly
what
would
happen
if
we
did
that.
we
would
be
cited
for
contempt.
if,
when
this
injunction
was
written
by
attorneys
on
the
other
side,
they
had
thought
that
we
could
do
that.
that
would've
been
put
in
the
injunction.
its
absence
makes
the
provisions
of
the
injunction
to
us
exclusive,
at
least
short
of
the
jeopardy
of
contempt.
i
notice,
i
just
one
or
two
more
minutes
and
i
have
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
--
two
very
important
things.
first,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
your
question,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
adequate
state
basis.
we
say
that
the
--
our
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied.
we
say
that
an
injunction
would
not
lie
and
we
filed
an
injunction
suit,
initially
just
like
an
injunction
did
not
lie
in
this
case
on
our
cross-action.
we
say
that
the
remedy
in
--
in
the
--
when
they
speak
of
remedy,
they
mean
what
you
fellas
could
have
done.
that's
what
they
mean.
they
don't
mean
you
have
to
come
into
this
court
and
file
this
injunction
suit
because
there
had
been
no
injunction
suit
filed
throughout
the
history
of
the
act
to
1954.
and
even
--
even
if
that
is
what
they
did
mean,
why,
clearly
we
would
not
have
gotten
the
injunction.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that
because
we
were
denied
the
injunction
here
on
our
cross-action.
now
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
was
because
they
said
trading
stamps
that
are
--
our
counterclaim
went
only
to
the
trading
stamps.
it
was
because
they
said
trading
stamps
do
not
--
do
not
constitute
a
price
reduction.
they
are
merely
a
cash
discount.
by
the
way,
a
number
of
course,
including
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
have
said
that
a
--
the
word,
"cash
discount"
is
merely
a
euphemism
for
price
cut.
now,
we
have
one
very
important
matter.
that's
the
matter
of
preemption.
i
just
have
a
moment.
preemption
was
not
mentioned
specifically
in
the
trial
court.
the
cases
under
preemption
were
outriders
throughout
this
case.
we
feel
first
that
the
question
is
one
of
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court.
second,
that
there
is
continuing
jurisdiction
in
the
trial
court.
this
--
this
injunction
still
plays
in
oklahoma.
we
feel
third,
that
in
the
field
of
preemption,
the
best
interest
under
the
federal
system,
under
this
constitution
is
that
preemption
be
treated
whenever
raised
and
there
is
no
law
to
the
contrary
that
we
have
seen.
the
reason
for
this
is
to
avoid,
at
the
earliest
possible
time,
collisions
between
federal
and
state
legislation.
finally,
there
is
without
question,
an
intervening
act
of
congress
that
gives
jurisdiction
over
this
subject
matter
to
the
federal
trade
commission.
on
september
2nd,
1958,
by
amendment
to
the
packers
and
stockyards
act,
jurisdiction
which
in
1921
by
section
227,
had
been
specifically
removed
over
packers
from
the
federal
trade
commission
was
placed
in
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
in
1957
and
prior
to
that,
it
was
held
that
15
of
the
largest
retail
grocers
in
the
country
were
packers.
that
they
were
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
that
is
in
re
food
fair
in
which
federal
trade
commission
refused
and
dismissed
--
refused
to
find
all
the
complaint
and
dismissed
from
all
the
jurisdiction
they
complaint
against
food
fair,
the
238
store
chain
here
on
the
east
coast
for
violation
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
robinson-patman
act
because
5%
of
their
business
was
in
meat.
it
has
been
described
throughout
the
legislative
history
as
a
quirk.
but
the
15
largest
retail
grocers
in
the
country
have
unquestionably
--
but
according
to
mr.
gwynne,
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
--
according
to
the
general
counsel
for
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
15
largest
retail
chains
in
the
country
have
been
packers
until
september
2nd,
1958
under
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
with
--
with
the
court's
permission,
we
would
like
to
file
a
three-page
memorandum
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment
to
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
because
it
has
not
been
fully
covered
in
our
brief.
this
would
not
be
more
three
pages.
we
could
get
it
into
mark.
mr.
ramsey
clark
thank
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
thank
you
very
much.
