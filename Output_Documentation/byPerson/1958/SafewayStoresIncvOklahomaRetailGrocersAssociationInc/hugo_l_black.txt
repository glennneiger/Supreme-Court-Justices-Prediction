does
the

show
whether
safeway
may

could
use
that

justice

suppose
the
state
had
set
the
law
which
required
all
of
the
scope
of
the
use
of
trading
stamp,
would
you
say
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice

aren't
you

it
didn't
you
quite
say

very
indefinitely
trade
stamps
to
finally
get
back
to
lots
of
other
--
the
state
can
require
the
use
of
trading
stamps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
the
same
as
it
is
though
they
had
set
at
some
stores
must
sell
it
at
a
lower
price
than
others.
justice

or
can
sell
at
a
lower
price
than
the
others.
justice

it
gets
back
to
the
question
of
whether
they
can
require
to
use
trading
stamps
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
might
have
the
purpose
of
reaching
the
conclusion
wrongfully
perhaps
and
a
fine
thing
for
the
state
to
have
trading
stamps,
for
everybody
to
have
them
since
so
many
have
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
really
asked
you
that
question
because
it
seems
to
me
like,
finally
perhaps,
we
get
down
to
the
question
as
to
whether
a
state
has
to
finally
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
we
have
to
do
that.
now,
that's
it.
if
such
this,
the
supreme
court
has
held
that's
what
the
statute
means
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
for
what
it
is?
and
how
can
we
say
that
the
state
supreme
court's
wrong
in
saying
that's
what
the
legislature
meant
to
do.

mr.
clark,
i
--
it
wouldn't
bother
you.
i'd
like
to
return
a
moment
to
the
injunction
--
justice
hugo
l.

--
on
page
452.
why
under
that
injunction
would
it
--
but
why
would
it
violate
that
injunction,
or
would
it,
if
safeway
whether
provides
cash
register
receipts
to
be
given,
every
purchaser
who
came
into
the
stores,
so
long
as
it
did
not
exceed
3%
of
the
selling
price?
justice
hugo
l.

why?

but
you
could
as
to

am
i
right

in
thinking
that
you
could
without

--
without
violating
the
injunction
provide
that
every
customer
who
came
in

be
given
2%
after

after
you
rang
up
his
account
on
the

where'd
you

to
what?
why
is
it
limited

merchandise
of

justice

why
not
cash?
justice

suppose
you
--
suppose
you
could,
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
would
object
to
doing
it,
but
would
that
put
you
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
others?
