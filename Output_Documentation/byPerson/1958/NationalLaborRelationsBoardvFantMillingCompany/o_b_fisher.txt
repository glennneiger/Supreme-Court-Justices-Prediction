mr.
o.
b.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
first,
by
way
of
introduction
in
this
case,
i
want
to
say
to
the
court
that
counsel
here
in
this
court
are
the
counsel
who
conducted
the
negotiations
which
are
brought
in
to
question.
there
is
no
embarrassment
on
the
part
of
the
counsel
by
reason
of
having
engaged
in
those
negotiations
notwithstanding
the
charges
that
are
made
by
the
labor
board.
fant
milling
company
is
a
relatively
small
industry
engaged
in
the
processing
of
wheat
and
grain
manufacturing
flour
and
feed,
during
--
was
two
plants,
one
in
sherman
and
one
mckinney,
texas
both
near
red
river.
the
number
of
employees
within
what
referred
to
as
the
bargaining
unit
or
the
hourly
paid
employees
were
about
200
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
this
proceeding
that's
now
reached
this
court.
the
union
sought
representation
of
those
employees.
and
in
due
course,
an
election
was
held.
and
approximately,
180
of
the
200
employees
voted
in
the
election.
those
voting
for
representations
by
the
union
outnumbered
those
voting
against
representation
of
--
by
the
union
by
about
eight
or
exactly
eight,
i
believe.
counsel
in
this
case
in
conducting
or
participating
certainly
more
expressive
and
in
participating
in
the
negotiations
made
subject
matter
of
this
litigation.
sincerely
as
the
capacity
of
counsel
would
permit
attempted
to
serve
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
thereby
serving
the
public
and
likewise
to
the
extent
of
the
capacity
of
possessed
attempted
to
serve
the
employees
of
fant
milling
company
as
a
part
of
the
public
and
of
course,
attempted
to
serve
fant
milling
company
are
declined.
now,
so
that
it
may
not
be
overlooked
by
the
court,
at
the
outset,
it
is
an
adjudicated
fact
in
this
case,
so
adjudicated
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
in
this
matter,
this
country
milling
company
paid
two
local
attorneys,
one
living
in
paris
and
one
in
sherman
against
the
experts
of
who
were
representing
the
union
in
the
negotiations
or
the
employees,
if
you
please.
so
let
us
not
be
misled
by
the
statement
of
counsel
for
the
board
or
general
counsel
rather
with
reference
to
charges
being
made
by
uninformed
persons
or
persons
who
are
not
informed
to
the
extent
that
they
know
how
to
frame
charges.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
particulars
that
are
urged
would
constitute
and
operate
effectively
and
conclusively
as
a
repel
of
section
10
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
additionally,
would
repel
and
hold
for
not
pertinent
provisions
of
the
administrative
act
and
likewise,
would
set
aside
regulations
of
the
board
itself.
mention
has
been
made
of
the
usual
time
for
the
issuance
of
a
complaint
if
a
complaint
is
issued
by
the
board
after
the
filing
of
a
charge.
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
issued
some
15
months
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
and
the
charge
will
be
referred
to,
i
hope,
as
well
as
the
complaint.
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
charge
and
the
complaint.there
is
only
one
common
expression
that
can
be
found
in
the
mete
of
the
two.
the
board
issued
the
complaint
august
17th,
i
believe,
or
the
regional
director
issued
the
complaint
august
17th,
1955.
the
charge
was
filed
march
20th
--
may
20th,
1954.
and
before
we
get
to
that,
if
you
please,
so
that
the
question
of
bargaining
in
good
faith
will
not
be
completely
left
out
of
this
presentation
by
the
respondent,
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
the
bargain
in
good
faith
that
there
was
done
by
the
representatives
of
the
respondent
everything
that
is
contemplated
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
the
respondent
sought
a
contract,
that
the
respondent
in
dealing
with
the
negotiating
committee
that
was
to
represent
the
respondent,
mr.
fant,
himself,
the
owner
and
manager,
said
to
those
persons
that
he
wanted
them
to
obtain
a
workable
contract
with
the
union
that
the
--
a
small
majority
of
the
employees
had
expressed
themselves.
and
what
he
wanted
was
a
contract
and
that
he
did
not
want
or
he
preferred
not
to
have
a
contract
of
that
carried
in
--
that
carried
in
it
a
seniority
clause
based
solely
upon
seniority,
that
is
that
no
promotion
would
be
made
except
based
upon
the
length
of
time
of
service,
that
he
preferred
that
there
be
no
arbitration
clause
because
he
felt
took
--
that
took
the
management
out
of
his
hands
and
out
of
the
hands
of
the
union
so
for
as
that's
concerned.
and
to
that,
he
hoped
and
desired
that
any
clause
in
the
contract
with
reference
to
a
no-lockout
and
no-strike
would
carry
a
penalty
of
some
guy
against
any
person
who
offended
against
that
clause,
so
that
he
could
feel
secure
in
his
operation
and
have
tranquility
between
himself
and
the
employees.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
the
october
17th
wage
increase
which
has
been
referred
to
was
authorized
and
necessary
that
if
the
board
had
been
entitled
to
consider
and
if
the
court
was
entitled
to
consider
it
that
it
would
not
constitute
bad
faith
bargaining,
it
would
not
constitute
a
refusal
to
bargain.
but
if
that
wage
increase
was
made
under
circumstances
that
are
authorized
in
sanction
by
the
labor
act
itself.
considerable
negotiation
had
been
carried
on
some
probably
17
or
18
conferences
before
that
time.
and
wages
had
been
discussed
and
at
the
most
recent
meetings,
they
had
not
been
discussed
because
the
union
refused
to
discuss
it.
it
had
been
the
position
of
mr.
fant
throughout
a
lifetime
that
he
would
pay
wages
at
that
plant
equal
to
or
in
excess
of
wages
paid
by
his
competitors.
and
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
grant
a
wage
increase
of
7
cents
an
hour
if
he
was
to
maintain
that
lifelong
position
that
he
had
tried
to
occupy
in
this
county
seat
community.
we
do
not
think
the
question
of
substantial
evidence
is
before
this
court
for
determination
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
pittsburgh
steam
ship
company
case,
i
believe
it
is,
or
in
this
court
said.
but
congress
has
charged
the
courts
of
appeals
and
not
this
court
and
i
mean
this
court
said
with
reference
to
this
subject
matter
with
a
normal
and
primary
responsibility
for
granting
or
denying
enforcement
of
labor
board
orders,
the
same
consideration
that
should
lead
us
to
leave
undisturbed
by
denying
certiorari
decisions
of
courts
of
appeals
involved
solely
a
fair
assessment
of
a
record
on
the
issue
of
insubstantiality
ought
to
lead
us
to
do
no
more
than
decide
that
there
was
such
a
fair
assessment
when
the
case
is
here
as
this
is
on
other
legal
issues.
this
is
not
the
place
to
review
a
conflict
of
evidence
nor
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
because
were
we
in
its
place,
we
would
find
the
record
tilting
one
way
rather
than
the
other
though
fair
minded
judges
could
find
it
tilting
either
way.
it
is
not
for
us
to
invite
review
by
this
court
of
decisions
turning
solely
on
evaluation
of
testimony
or
on
a
contentious
consideration
of
the
record
and
so
forth
of
that
determination
had
been
made
by
a
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
definitely
and
expressly
decided
this
question
of
substantial
evidence
when
and
if
the
law
of
questions
are
ever
determined
adversely
to
the
decision
of
that
court.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
that
the
october
17th
wage
increase
should
not
be
considered
that
it
was
barred
by
section
10
(b)
of
the
labor
act.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
mr.
justice
black,
we
do
not.
now,
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
judge
hutcheson,
judge
hutcheson
said
in
substance
that
he
did
not
agree
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
supporting
the
charge
even
though
the
october
17th
wage
increase
was
considered
that
even
if
it
was
considered,
why,
he
did
not
agree
or
something
to
that
sense.
i'm
not
looking
at
the
--
i'm
not
looking
at
the
opinion.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
all
right,
sir,
it
is
at
--
on
page
--
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
it's
on
page
548
of
the
record.
and
he
used
this
language,
i
believe,
on
that
subject
matter
were
the
only
question
in
this
case
whether
the
record
as
a
whole
supports
the
board's
finding
that
is
charge
by
the
union
and
alleged
in
paragraph
(8)
of
the
complaint,
respondent
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
union
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
(1)
of
the
act.
i
would
content
myself
with
concurring
in
the
view
of
the
majority
that
under
said
law,
n.l.r.b.
v.
american
national
insurance
company
343
u.s.
395,
it
does
not.
and
that
reference
is
to
opinion
of
this
court,
i
believe.
it
appears
to
the
respondent
that
the
issue
has
not
been
determined
as
to
whether
substantial
evidence
exists
by
the
court,
that
is
a
concurring
--
that
is
a
statement
in
a
concurring
opinion.
in
the
event
that
that
court
should
be
called
upon
to
consider
of
the
october
17th
wage
increase
even
though
that
judge
hutcheson
has
indicated
his
feeling
by
what
he
said,
it
seems
to
me,
with
some
certainty,
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
foreclosed
and
it's
not
determined
so
far
as
the
opinion
is
concerned.
the
respondent
considers
that
the
procedural
issues
are
serious.
we
feel
that
they
are
important
to
the
public.
we
feel
that
they
are
important
to
the
labor
board
itself.
and
such
questions
are
certainly
important
fant
milling
company.
the
charge
was
filed
may
20th,
1954
and
served
may
21,
1954.
the
charge
is
in
the
record
at
page
20
and
an
attention
is
directed
to
two
parts
of
that
charge,
one,
this
broad
and
usual
and
customary
allegation
that
found
in
complaints
and
charges
universally
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
and
that
doesn't
extend
very
far,
if
you
please.
two,
on
or
about
november
20th,
1953,
it,
by
its
officers,
agents
and
employees,
refused
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
authorized
agents
of
american
federation
of
grain
millers
a.f.
of
l.
chosen
by
a
majority
of
its
employees
at
its
plant
to
represent
them
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
in
respect
to
the
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment
and
other
conditions
of
employment,
which
follows
the
language
of
the
act
itself
and
is
the
usual
allegation
in
a
charge
and
in
every
charge,
so
far
as
i
am
concern.
and
then
it's
alleged
in
the
next
paragraph
to
top
of
page
21,
on
or
about
to
date
set
out
as
fair
names
below,
it,
by
its
officers,
agents
and
employees,
terminated
the
employment
of
four
named
persons
because
of
their
membership
and
activities
in
behalf
of
american
federation
of
grain
millers
a.f.
of
l.,
a
labor
organization.and
at
all
times
since
such
date,
it
has
refused
and
does
now
refused
to
employ
the
above
named
employees.
attention
is
directed
to
the
charge
because
it's
considered
by
the
respondent
to
be
important
in
this
case.
that
charge
was
filed
--
was
served
may
21st
on
the
respondent.
and
true
as
said
by
mr.
manoli,
it
contains
in
the
printed
form
has
engaged
in
and
is
now
engaging
in
unfair
labor
practice.
and
we
say
that
the
most
it
can
say
is
that
on
march
--
on
may
20th,
the
date
of
filing
that
is
alleged
an
unfair
labor
practice
was
being
engaged
in.
please
note,
as
shown
by
the
record,
page
25,
that
on
july
13th,
1904,
the
regional
director
advised
the
parties
and
gave
notice
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
the
allegations
contained
in
the
charge
and
that
he
was
refusing
to
issue
a
complaint
on
the
charge.
that
was
july
13th,
1954.
in
that
notice
as
usual,
he
directed
the
procedure
for
perfecting
an
appeal
from
his
ruling
and
decision.
that
was
made
after
the
investigation
that
was
referred
to
by
our
adversaries.
and
he
--
the
regional
director
acted,
refused
to
issue
the
complaint
and
the
union
then,
through
the
same
persons
that
filed
the
charge,
are
represented
by
counsel,
filed
a
petition
or
a
request,
i
believe,
is
called
in
the
act
or
in
the
regulation,
with
the
general
counsel
to
review
that
decision
by
the
regional
director.
and
the
rules
and
regulations
are
specific
on
that
subject
matter.
the
administrative
act
provides,
among
other
things,
of
course,
section
1002,
every
agencies
shall
separately
state
and
currently
publish
in
the
federal
register,
one,
description
of
its
central
field
organization
and
so
forth,
statements
of
general
course,
two,
statements
of
general
course
and
method
by
which
it
functions
are
channeled
and
determined
including
the
nature
and
requirements
of
all
formal
or
informal
procedure
available
as
well
as
forms
and
instructions
as
to
the
scope
and
contents
of
all
papers
and
so
forth,
three,
shall
make
and
publish
by
interrelation
substantiative
rules
adapted
as
authorized
by
law
and
statements
of
general
policy
or
interpretation
formulated
and
adapted
by
the
agency
for
the
guidance
of
the
public.
and
then,
if
you
please,
no
person
shall,
in
any
manner,
be
required
to
resort
to
organization
or
procedure
not
so
published.
now,
pursuing
to
that
requirement,
the
labor
board
did
publish
its
rules
and
regulations
including
section
102.12
wherein
it
sets
out
what
a
charge
shall
contain
a
clear
and
precise
statement
of
the
facts
upon
which
of
the
facts
affecting
commerce
and
so
forth.
100
--
section
101,
that
section
thus
mentioned
provides
for
the
filing
of
the
section
102.19
provide
for
the
filing
of
the
charge.
and
then,
if,
after
the
charge
has
been
filed,
the
regional
director
declines
to
issue
a
complaint,
he
shall
so
advise
the
parties
from
writing
accompanied
by
a
sample
statement
of
the
procedural
or
other
grounds.
the
person
making
the
charge
may
obtain
a
review
of
such
action
by
filing
a
request.
that
was
done.
and
seeing
the
warning
on
my
time,
i
certainly
will
not
proceed
further
with
that
except
to
say,
that
to
now
hope,
that
for
the
first
time
that
the
regional
director
can
withdraw
an
action
while
it's
on
appeal
before
it
is
acted
on
by
the
general
counsel
will
superimpose
his
functions
above
that
of
the
general
council
adversely
to
what
is
intended
by
the
law
as
understood
by
us.
the
fatal
question
in
this
proceeding
is
with
reference
to
the
limitation
of
requirement
that
the
six
months
shall
be
a
cutoff
date.
the
board
found
that
november
21st,
1953
was
the
cutoff
date.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
issued
some
10
months
after
the
alleged
wage
increase.
the
charge
was
filed
some
five
months
ahead
of
that
time,
so
you
have
some
14
or
15
months
of
intervening
in
which
this
wage
increase
occurred.
if
is
to
be
held
that
this
--
the
board
has
jurisdiction
in
such
case,
you
certainly
will
be
giving
to
the
board
carte
blanche
authority
to
proceed
and
file
any
character
of
complaint,
as
was
mentioned
by
justice
black
maybe
as
having
been
done
at
one
time
without
regard
to
whether
a
charge
has
been
filed
or
what's
contained
in
the
charge.
there
is
nothing
related
--
there
is
no
relation
between
the
wage
increase
and
the
allegation
contained
in
the
charge.
the
national
licorice
case,
we
think,
supports
our
position
very
definitely.
and
i
regret
that
time
will
not
permit
reading
an
excerpt
from
that
decision.
there,
and
the
question
presented
with
the
board
in
this
case,
is
presented
to
this
court
in
such
a
way
that
if
this
case
is
reversed
in
the
language
of
the
question
submitted
by
the
board,
then
there
will
go
out
the
window
everything
that
has
been
stated
in
this
argument
by
the
petitioner
with
reference
to
related
acts
because
the
question
is
so
framed
that
there
need
be
no
connection
between
the
charge
or
any
allegation
in
the
charge
and
the
complaint.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
listening
to
me.
