may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
that
when
every
charges
is
filed
alleging
the
commission
of
unfair
labor
practice,
the
board
may
issue
a
complaint
stating
the
charges
in
that
respect.
the
principal
question
here
is
whether
the
board's
complaint
must
be
confined
to
the
allegations
of
the
charge
or
whether
the
complaint
may
include
matters
or
events
which
occur
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
and
pending
the
board's
investigation
of
that
charge.
the
court
below
answered
this
question
in
the
negative.
and
i
shall
faithfully
summarize
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
our
problem
here.
in
1953,
the
board
certified
the
union
which
is
involved
in
these
proceedings
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
company's
employees.
thereafter,
between
august
of
that
year
and
november
of
the
following
year,
representatives
of
the
union
and
of
the
company
engaged
in
a
series
of
20
almost
--
about
20
conferences
for
the
purposes
of
arriving
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
they
were
unable
to
do
so.
among
the
principle
obstacles
that
prevented
agreement
were
the
company's
insistence
upon
a
contract
which
would
give
it
the
unilateral
right
during
the
life
of
the
contract
to
either
raise
or
lower
the
wages
that
were
agreed
to
in
the
contract.
the
company's
refusal
to
incorporate
in
any
agreement
provisions
of
the
respect
to
existing
employment
practices
at
the
plant
despite
the
fact
that
some
of
these
had
been
in
existence
for
some
time
and
despite
the
further
fact
that
the
company
said
that
it
had
no
present
intention
of
changing
them.
and
--
and
further,
the
company's
insistence
upon
a
no-strike
provision
with
a
--
with
a
monetary
penalty
for
its
breach,
coupled
with
the
company's
refusal
to
give
to
the
union
the
normal
quid
pro
quo
for
that
kind
of
a
--
an
agreement,
namely,
a
grievance
procedure
with
arbitration.
the
company
insisted
that
any
grievances
should
be
ultimately
be
--
ultimately
be
resolved
by
the
presence
of
the
company.
the
atmosphere
of
these
negotiations
was
not
enhanced
when,
in
april
of
1954,
the
company
made
certain
individual
wage
adjustments
which
the
union
had
indicated
that
it
want
to
discuss
but
the
company
did
this,
however,
without
first
notifying
or
consulting
with
the
union
that
it
was
putting
these
changes
into
effect.
in
may
of
1954,
the
union
filed
a
charge
with
the
board
and
this
charge
alleged
that
the
company
had
engaged
and
was
engaging
in
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
85
of
the
act,
that's
the
bargaining
provision
of
the
statute.
and
also
that
the
company
on
or
about
november
20th,
1953
had
refused
to
bargain
with
the
--
with
the
union
collectively.
the
board's
regional
director,
with
whom
this
charge
was
filed
after
investigation,
informed
the
parties
that
he
was
declining
to
issue
a
complaint
because
in
his
view,
the
--
the
investigation
did
not
disclose
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
issuance
of
a
complaint.
the
union
thereupon
appealed
from
the
regional
director's
action
to
the
board's
general
counsel.
while
the
appeal
was
pending
before
the
board's
general
counsel,
the
company
and
the
union
continued
to
negotiate.
and
then
october
of
1954,
the
company
unilaterally
without
prior
notice
or
consultation
with
the
union
put
into
effect
a
--
a
general
wage
increase
for
all
of
the
employers
and
after
having
done
so,
notified
the
union.
in
fact,
the
union
discovered
it
quite
fortuitously
through
the
employers
of
another
plant.
the
negotiations
continued
after
this
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
the
employer
for
two
more
meetings.
and
on
the
last
of
these
meetings,
the
company
abruptly
terminated
the
negotiations
when
it
notified
the
union
that
it
had
worth
--
word-of-mouth
information
that
the
union
no
longer
represented
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
the
plant.
the
union
reported
these
matters
to
the
board's
regional
director.
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
board's
regional
director
wrote
to
the
parties,
both
to
the
union
and
to
the
company,
that
he
was
withdrawing
his
earlier
refusal
to
issue
a
complaint
on
the
union's
charges
and
that
the
matter
would
be
investigated
further.
in
august
of
that
year,
this
was
some
time
in
january
of
1955,
in
august
of
that
year,
the
board's
general
counsel
notified
the
parties
that
in
view
of
the
regional
director's
action
withdrawing
his
earlier
refusal
to
issue
a
complaint
that
all
further
inquiry
should
be
addressed
to
the
regional
director.
and
--
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
regional
director
issued
a
complaint
against
the
company.
and
the
complaint,
in
relevant
part,
alleged
that
the
company
on
and
after
november
21st,
1953
had
refused
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
union
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
further
that
on
or
about
october
7th,
1954,
1954,
the
company
had
put
into
effect
the
unilateral
wage
increase
without
prior
notice
to
the
union.
upon
the
record
that
was
made
on
this
complaint
before
the
board's
hearing
officer,
hearing
examiner
which
also
included
the
transcript
of
the
negotiations
between
the
company
and
the
union
that
continued
for
nearly
15
months,
the
board
found
that
the
record
clearly
evidenced
the
company's
refusal
throughout
the
course
of
the
negotiations
to
bargain
in
good
evidence
--
clearly
evidence
the
company's
failure
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
that
this
conclusion
was
confirmed
by
the
unilateral
wage
increase
of
october
1954.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
unilateral
wage
increase
occurred
after,
after
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
after
the
charge
was
filed.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
charge,
your
honor,
alleged
that,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
within
general
terms
that
the
union
--
that
the
company
had
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practices
and
was
engaging
within
the
meaning
of
(a)
(5).
and
further,
that
on
or
about
november
21st,
the
company
had
refused
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
union.
now,
i'll
--
the
six
months
provision
to
which
your
honor
is
referring
to
provides
that
the
board
shall
not
issue
a
complaint
based
upon
charges
occurring
more
than
six
months
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge.
and
i
will
come
to
it
later
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
point.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
because
there
has
been
some
confusion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
board's
findings
with
respect
to
the
company's
good
faith,
i
believe
it
will
be
helpful
because
this
will
be
significant
later
on
in
the
course
of
the
argument
that
i
found
to
make.
if
i
may
read
very
briefly,
this
is
at
page
119
of
the
record,
the
page
upon
top,
119,
the
board
said,
"we
have
no
difficulty
in
determining
the
respondent's
bad
faith
throughout
these
protracted
negotiations
particularly
in
view
of
the
respondent's
unilateral
effectuation
of
a
general
wage
increase
early
in
october
1954
while
the
negotiations
were
still
in
progress
but
without
consultation
with
or
even
notice
to
the
union,"
and
then
skipping
over
to
page
128
in
order
to
fill
out
this,
at
--
on
page
126
rather
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
the
board
in
conclusionary
term
said,
"we
find
rather
that
the
giving
of
this
general
increase
while
negotiations
were
still
continuing
and
in
complete
disregard
of
the
union's
representative
status
provide
the
final
insight
into
the
respondent's
conduct
of
negotiations
with
the
union.”
it
clearly
shows
that
after
november
21st,
1953,
the
cutoff
date
determined
by
the
general
counsel
pursuant
provisions
of
section
10
(b),
respondent
was
merely
going
through
the
motions
of
collective
bargaining
without
a
genuine
intention
of
trying
to
negotiate
an
agreement
over
the
union.
now,
the
court
below
read
the
board's
decision
to
mean
and
parenthetically,
i
may
say
that
we
think
it
was
an
error,
the
court
below
read
the
board's
decision
to
mean
that
a
part
from
the
unilateral
wage
increase
of
october
1954,
the
record
of
the
negotiations
between
the
company
and
the
union
would
not
support,
would
not
support
a
finding
that
the
company
had
bargained
in
bad
faith
during
these
negotiations.
accordingly,
accordingly,
the
critical
question
for
the
court
below
became
whether
the
board's
complaint
could
take
cognizance
of
the
unilateral
wage
increase
which
occurred
after
the
filing
of
the
union's
charge.
the
answer
which
the
court
below
gave
is
this,
“the
principal
opinion
of
the
court
below
said
that
the
board's
complaint
must
be
confined
to
the
specific
allegations
of
the
charge
and
that
the
board's
complaint
may
not
take
cognizance
of
the
events
which
occur
after
the
filing
of
the
charge.”
the
concurring
opinion
by
judge
hutcheson
took
the
position
that
the
unilateral
wage
increase
of
october
was
a
completely
new
and
independent
cause
of
action
unrelated,
unrelated
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge
and
that
therefore,
the
board
was
powerless
to
take
that
into
consideration,
judge
reeves
who
dissented
--
dissented
on
both
counts.
it
is
our
position
that
the
board
may
take
cognizance,
the
board
may
take
cognizance
of
the
events
which
occur
after
the
filing
of
the
charge
which
are
either
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
--
which
are
either
grow
out
of
or
are
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge
pending
the
board's
investigation
of
the
charge
and
secondly
that
the
unilateral
wage
increase
which
took
place
here
after
the
filing
of
charge
is
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge
which
was
filed
in
--
in
may
of
1954.
now,
let
me
address
myself
first
to
the
second,
what
i
regard
as
the
subsidiary
question,
namely,
whether
the
unilateral
wage
increase,
which
occurred
after
the
filing
of
the
charge,
was
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
union's
charge.
the
charge,
in
effect,
called
upon
the
board
to
investigate
the
bargaining
relationship
between
the
company
and
the
union.
this
unilateral
wage
increase
took
place
in
the
course
of
that
bargaining
relationship.
indeed,
it
went
to
the
very
heart
of
that
relationship
for
as
this
court
has
set
such
action
of
that
kind
on
the
part
of
an
employer
constitutes
the
very
antithesis
of
collective
bargaining
and
a
negation,
and
a
negation
of
the
union's
representative
status.
more
than
that,
the
unilateral
wage
increase
was
a
further
reflection,
a
further
manifestation
and
further
continuation,
if
you
will,
of
the
company's
persistent
attitude
throughout
the
negotiations
on
the
base
which
lead
to
the
charge
of
the
company's
persistent
attitude
of
maintaining
a
completely
freehand
with
respect,
with
respect
to
the
terms
and
the
conditions
of
employment.
we
think
that
in
every
meaningful,
in
any
meaningful
sense,
it
must
be
said
that
the
unilateral
wage
increase
of
october
is
--
directly
bears
upon
the
bargaining
relationship
which
the
board
was
called
upon
to
investigate
and
is
directly
related
to
us.
the
argument
is
made,
however,
that
since
the
board
did
not
find
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
basis
of
the
pre-charge
conduct,
that
the
post-charge
unilateral
wage
increase
is
not
related,
is
not
related
to
the
pre-charge
conduct.
apart
from
the
fact
that
this
argument
misreads
initially,
it
misreads
initially
the
board's
--
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
because,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
and
this
is
the
one
with
the
reasons
why
i
read
the
board's
decision,
the
board
found
that
the
company,
throughout
the
course
of
these
negotiations,
had
manifested
at
bad
faith.
the
argument
is
made
that
they
say
on
this
reading
of
the
board's
--
on
this
reading
of
the
board's
decision
that
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
on
--
during
--
committed
during
the
time
preceding
the
charge.
the
argument
is
made
that
the
post-charge
unilateral
wage
increase
is
not
related
to
any
unfair
labor
practice
which
is
a
subject
of
the
--
of
the
charge.
as
i
say,
this
does
not
only
misreads
the
board's
decision
but
it
doesn't
hold
any
--
doesn't
--
the
argument
doesn't
have
any
merit
because
the
critical
factor
is
whether,
for
our
purposes
of
relationship,
for
determining
relationship
in
this
context,
the
critical
factors
whether
the
post-charge
events
or
matters
have
immaterial
and
logical
connection
with
the
subject
matter,
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge.
now,
that
connection
exist
or
does
not
exist,
it
seems
to
us,
without
regard
to
what
the
board's
ultimate
conclusions
may
be
as
to
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
conduct
in
question.
now,
let
me
turn
now
to
what
we
believe
is
the
principle
question,
the
more
important
question
in
this
case,
namely,
whether
the
board
may
take
cognizance
of
events
or
matters
which
occur
after
the
filing
of
a
charge
but
which
are
grow
out
of,
as
we
or
are
--
as
in
this
case,
or
are
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge.
the
principal
opinion
below,
as
i
have
indicated,
took
the
positions
that
the
complaint
of
the
board
must
be
confined,
must
be
confined
to
the
subject
--
to
the
--
the
allegations
of
the
charge
and
that
the
board
may
--
may
not
look
or
take
cognizance
of
the
events
which
occur
after
the
filing
of
the
charge.
we
believe
that
this
view
rest
upon
a
mistaken
conception
of
what
a
charge
is,
what
a
complaint
is,
and
what
the
board's
role
is
in
the
investigation
on
the
prosecution
of
charges.
the
statute
provides,
as
i
briefly
alluded
to
a
moment
ago,
the
statute
provides
that
when
--
whenever
a
charge
is
filed
alleging
that
a
person
is
engaging
or
has
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practices,
the
board
is
empowered
to
issue
a
complaint
stating
the
charges
in
that
respect.
the
statute
also
provides
that
the
board
shall
not
issue
a
complaint
with
respect
to
unfair
labor
practice
that
occur
--
that
have
occurred
more
than
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge.
now,
a
charge
under
the
statute
may
be
filed
by
anyone.
it
is
all
compiled
by
people
who,
in
the
nature
of
things,
have
limited
perception,
understanding
of
the
conducts
to
which
they
are
complaining,
its
ramifications
and
its
legal
significance.
a
charge
is
not
a
pleading.
all
that
the
charge
does
is
merely
set
the
board's
machinery
in
the
motion.
now,
once
the
--
the
charge
has
been
filed
and
the
board's
machinery
has
been
set
in
motion,
then
the
--
the
burden,
the
responsibility
for
investigating
the
charge
rest
with
the
board.
and
if
the
board
determines
on
the
basis
of
its
investigation
that
a
complaint
should
issue,
like
the
complaint
issues
and
the
statute
also
expressly
provides
that
the
board
may
amend
that
complaint
at
anytime
prior
to
the
issuance
of
a
final
order.
the
statutory
scheme,
it
seems
to
us,
suggest
that
it
is
the
board's
obligation
to
frame
the
issues
between
itself
and
the
party
charged
and
the
complaint
serves
this
purpose.
it
has
often
been
said
that
the
case
between
the
board
and
the
particular
respondent
starts
not
with
the
charge
really
but
actually
--
but
rather
with
the
complaint.
and
this,
we
think,
is
in
keeping
with
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
statute,
namely,
that
the
board's
function
is
to
vindicate
public
rights
and
not
private
rights.
now,
if
the
court
below
is
right
that
the
board
must
stick
closely,
must
stick
closely
to
the
allegations
of
the
charge
and
be
oblivious,
and
be
oblivious
to
related
conduct
whether
it
occurs
before
the
filing
of
the
charge
or
after,
that,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
result
is,
the
result
is
that
the
vindication
of
the
public
rights
which
the
statute
has
in
mind
rest
largely,
upon
the
necessarily
and
often
limited
perception,
judgement
and
certainly,
inadequate
investigation
of
a
private
party
rather
upon
the
informed
judgement
of
the
board
after
a
full
investigation.
more
than
that,
i
think
that
such
an
artificial
restriction
upon
the
board's
power
would
often
hamper
the
board
in
addressing
itself
in
a
comprehensive
and
meaningful
manner
of
fashion
to
the
picture
which
its
investigation
has
disclosed.
and
i
think
the
instant
case
here
illustrates
that
point.
here,
the
charge,
in
effect,
called
upon
the
board
to
investigate
the
bargaining
relationship
between
the
company
--
company
and
the
union.
that
relationship
was
a
continuing
one.
it
did
not
end
with
a
filing
of
the
charge
but
continued
thereafter.
and
yet,
the
court
below
would
say
to
the
board,
that
the
board
must
stop
in
its
investigation
of
a
continuing
course
of
conduct
must
stop
with
the
date
of
the
charge,
with
the
date
of
the
charge
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
do
we
have
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
do
we
have
this
problem
very
often?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
we
do
have
that.
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
so
when
i
--
we
speak
of
variance,
i
don't
--
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
would
not
introduce
a
new
and
unrelated
subject.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
would
often
be
in
terms
of
the
company
on
and
after
such
--
such
date
has
refused
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
union
and
no
more
than
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
the
complaint
will
also
be
in
very
general
terms
that,
of
course,
it
always
has
to
be
within
a
period
that
does
not
go
beyond
more
than
six
months
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
there
--
if
there
is
a
--
an
allegation
of
complaint
that
the
company
has
refused
to
bargain
collectively,
obviously,
that
open
up
--
opens
up
a
wide
area
of
investigating
the
course
of
the
negotiations
between
the
company
and
the
--
and
the
particular
union.
and
there
can
sometimes
new
matter
maybe
introduced
and
the
statute
expressively
permits
the
board
to
amend
its
complaint
at
any
time
prior
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
indeed.
in
--
not
only
do
we
introduce
matters
which,
we
think,
are
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
--
of
the
charge
which
have
occurred
after
but
also,
of
course,
we
obviously
will
use
witnesses
and
documentary
evidence
to
support
that
kind
of
an
allegation.
that
happens
quite
often.
and
we
haven't
had
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
now,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
i
think
that
the
restriction
which
the
court
below
has
imposed
upon
the
board's
power
with
respect
to
this
complaint
will
seriously
hamper
--
will
seriously
hamper
the
board
in
addressing
itself
in
a
meaningful
manner
to
the
--
in
a
comprehensive
matter
to
the
picture
which
this
investigation
discloses
and
this
case
here,
as
i
say,
illustrates
that
point
because
here,
here,
the
court
below
would
have
the
board
stop,
would
have
the
board
stop
short
with
the
date
of
the
charge
despite
the
fact
that
the
negotiations
between
the
company
did
not
end,
did
not
end
with
the
filing
of
the
charge
but
continue
thereafter.
in
other
words,
the
court
below
is
saying
that
the
board
can
only
look,
can
only
look
to
that
piece
of
negotiations
which
preceded
the
filing
of
the
charge
but
did
not
end,
did
not
end
with
the
filing
of
the
charge
and
despite
the
fact,
as
i
have
indicated
earlier,
what
happened
after
the
charge
is
directly
related.
in
fact,
it's
part
of
a
continuous
and
unfolding
picture
of
the
negotiations
between
the
company
and
the
union.
now,
we
don't
say,
we
don't
say
that
the
board
has
a
completely
freehand
in
framing
its
complaint
that
it
--
that
the
board
may
go
off
on
a
frolic
of
its
own
and
introduce
new
independent
and
unrelated
matters,
matters
that
are
unrelated
to
the
subject
matter
of
--
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
board
is
powerless
to
act
independently
of
a
charge.
we
do
need
a
charge
in
order
to
set
our
machinery
into
motion
and
presumably
that
kind
of
scheme
requires
a
degree
of
correlation
between
charge
and
complaint.
but
we
submit
that
that
degree
of
correlation
should
not
be
converted
into
a
straitjacket
so
as
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
--
i
think
we
have
some
figures
on
this,
which
i'm
--
which
i
do
not
have
in
my
own
mind.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
i
would
say
within
a
matter
of
two
or
three
months
at
the
outside
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
then
we
would
be
issuing
a
complaint.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i
might
say
that
at
one
time,
the
board
took
exactly
that
position
that
it
felt
that
once
there
was
a
charge
filed
that
the
complaint
that
simply
covered
the
whole
waterfront
without
being
limited
at
a
specific
charges
of
the
allegations.
we
had
a
little
rough
flooding
with
that
proposition
in
the
courts
particularly
here
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
whether
it
was
as
a
consequence
of
that
--
of
those
decisions
or
whether
it
was
as
a
result
of
further
study
by
the
board,
the
board
has
finally
narrowed
its
position
on
this
and
its
present
position
is
and
its
position
which
governs
this
case
--
would
governs
this
case
that
where
the
post-charge
events
are
--
grow
out
off
or
are
related,
or
are
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge,
the
board
will
take
cognizance
of
those
matters
in
its
complaint
and
its
decision.
and
we
--
we
believe
that
the
board's
position
in
this
respect
is
supported
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
national
licorice
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
we
[laughs]
--
well,
i
hope
that
the
larger
includes
the
lesser
[laughs].
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
you
asked
me,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
you
spoken
on
this,
yes.
you
spoke
--
the
court
spoke
on
this
problem
in
the
national
licorice
case
which
was
decided
in
1940.
now,
it's
true
that
that
case
was
decided
under
the
original
act
and
--
but
the
language,
the
controlling
language
is
the
same.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
which
warranted
a
restriction
upon
the
board's
power
to
include,
in
its
complaint,
matters
which
either
grew
out
of
or
are
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
charge.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
was.
yes,
the
court
addresses
itself
fully
to
that
--
to
that
issue.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
the
--
we
could,
i
think
[laughs],
except
that
for
one
factor,
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
has
already
alluded
to
this,
and
that
is
that
while
we
think
that
controlling
language
remains
the
same
in
the
new
statute
as
it
was
in
the
old
statute,
there
is
this
now
in
the
new
statute
a
provision
which
says,
which
says
that
the
board
may
not
issue
a
complaint
based
upon
charges
occurring
more
than
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge.
and
suggestions
has
been
made
here
that
here,
there
was
no
charge
with
respect
to
this
post-charge
unilateral
wage
increase
and
in
some
fashion
or
other,
this
particular
restriction
bars
the
board
from
taking
cognizance
of
it.
now,
i
frankly
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
that
provision
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
our
problem
in
this
case.
what
that
provision
is,
is
a
statute
of
limitations
which
simply
says,
which
simply
says
that
the
board
may
not
base
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding
on
matters
which
occurs
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge.
it's
a
--
they
say
it's
a
statute
of
limitations
which
cuts
off,
cuts
off
that
liability
with
respective
matters
that
have
occurred
more
than
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge.
this
court's
decision
in
national
licorice
was
on
the
books
when
congress
considered
this
--
considered
the
amendments
and
there
is
not
a
suggestion,
there
is
not
a
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
limitations
proviso
that
congress,
that
congress
intended
to
--
to
wipe
out,
to
amend
in
anyway
the
rule
which
this
court
had
laid
down
in
the
national
licorice
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
on
our
last
problem,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
a
peripheral
at
best,
at
best
but
i
think
when
you
finally
come
down
to
it,
at
least
we
have
come
up
for
the
answer
that
we
don't
think
it
really
has
any
bearing
upon
this
problem.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
beginning
november
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
on
or
about
november
20th,
1953.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
20th,
1954.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
you
--
if
you
begin
from
the
date
november
20
--
let
me
add
this,
your
honor.
that
the
--
the
charge
says
on
or
about
november
20th.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
the
argument
is
made
on
the
other
side
that
this
means
november
20.
there's
no
other
date
and
that
therefore,
that
charge
is
filed
more
than
six
calendar
months
after.
the
charge
was
filed
more
than
six
calendar
months
after
november
20th.
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
should
read
the
phrase
as
it
occurs
in
the
charge
on
or
about
november
20th
was
such
a
constricting
narrowness,
after
all,
the
charge
is
not
a
will
that
we're
construing.
the
phrase
on
or
about
november
20th
gives
us
a
certain
amount
of
leeway.
now,
let
me
answer
what
i
think
is
fact
of
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
don't
particularly
have
to
rely
upon
what
occurred
prior
to
november
20th
because
there
were
only
three
conferences
that
took
place
between
the
company
and
the
union
prior
to
november
20th,
1953.
after
november
20th,
1953,
there
were
seven
conferences
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charges.
and
during
those
seven
conferences
the
position
of
this
company
with
respect
to
the
bargaining
of
your
changes
had
been
laid
out
on
the
record
and
made
perfectly
clear
so
that
the
board
does
not
have
to
look
back
to
the
three
conferences
that
occurred
more
than
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charge.
do
i
answer
your
question,
sir?
