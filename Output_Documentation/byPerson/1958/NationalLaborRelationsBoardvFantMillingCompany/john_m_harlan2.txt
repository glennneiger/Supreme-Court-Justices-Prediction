could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
charge,
as
i
understand
it,
was
not
the
unilateral
wage
increase
but
the
failure
to
bargain.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
turns
on
the
question
that
you
come
into
is
with
when
the
six-month
period
did
arise.
and
--
that's
why
i
want
to
know
what
the
charge
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
six
months.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
let's
get
it
up
then.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
courts
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
the
courts
of
appeals
has
split
up
the
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
fifth
circuit
and
third
circuit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
it
does
have
some
peripheral
relevance
to
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
the
question
that
bothers
me
directly
to
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
these
charges
were
--
were
based
on
an
unfair
labor
practice
beginning
in
--
in
august
of
1953,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
november
1953.
the
charges
were
--
the
complaint
was
filed
when?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
much
more
than
six
months.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
understand
you.
i
understand
you.
