can
i
ask
you
--
can
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
before
--
what
you've
just
said
that
the
complaint
stand
as
it
will
go
for
appeal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
be
unrelated
to
what
was
in
the
complaint?
why
is
that
so
in
light
of
the
general
guide
which
you
asked
us
today
in
mind,
namely,
that
the
board
represent
the
public
interest
which
an
individual
starts
by
--
why
(inaudible)
limitation
is
so
as
between
a
charge
and
a
filing
of
a
complaint,
is
there
any
medium
--
medium
or
norm
of
time
between
(inaudible)
promptly
between
the
party
of
the
complaint,
the
charge
and
the
complaint,
what
is
the
usual
time?
months,
weeks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
varies
greatly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
it?
what
--
what
magnitude?
months
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
during
those
--
during
that
period
wherein
which
i
presume
inquiries
make,
studies
make
by
the
board,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
are
developed
new
kind
of
disobedience
in
violation
of
the
--
the
taft-hartley
or
the
wagner
act,
what
--
what
is
the
reason
why
that
cannot
be
incorporated
in
a
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
bearing?
in
other
words,
what
is
the
legal
relation
if
the
complaint
is
not
to
be
bounded
by
the
(inaudible)
by
the
complaint?
why
should
it
not
be
free
to
make
any
charges
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
seems
appropriate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
--
have
we
spoken
at
all
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
the
original
position
be
--
be
more
rational
with
the
present
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it
doesn't
involve
any
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
has
so
many
important
points.
i
didn't
know
that
that
was
one
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
know,
i
don't
mean
to
say
it
wasn't
said
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
it
wasn't
if
you
said
so
but
i
didn't
know
that
was
one
of
the
controverted
question
in
there.
was
that
an
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
couldn't
you
cite
that
case
in
the
record?
