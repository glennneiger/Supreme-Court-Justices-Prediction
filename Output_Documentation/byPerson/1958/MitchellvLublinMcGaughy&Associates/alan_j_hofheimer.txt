mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
that
has
been
brought
with
two
parts
by
the
labor
department
against
an
independent
engineering
and
architectural
firm
just
as
local
we
submit
as
any
architectural
and
engineering
firm
maybe.
it
was
started
off
in
norfolk
and
eventually
enough
business
was
produced
up
here
in
washington
to
open
a
branch
in
washington.
there
are
i
think
about
20
employers
in
washington
office
now
and
about
30
in
the
norfolk
office.
since
the
washington
office
was
opened,
this
firm
has
taken
on
some
engagements
overseas
that
as
a
subsidiary
firm
as
or
that
one
of
the
partners
has
been
over
there
attending
to
it
for
the
united
states
government,
for
the
army
and
it
was
stipulated
i
believe
that
those
employees
didn't
enter
into
this
controversy
at
all.
now,
the
department
of
labor
has
built
up
a
vast
empire
here
or
attempted
to
of
architects
and
engineers
who
are
doing
business
from
one
state
to
another
and
are
doing
business
almost
internationally.
we
submit
that
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
we
submit
that
the
stipulation
doesn't
show
it
and
also,
that
seven
of
witnesses
in
addition
to
the
stipulation
that
were
put
on
in
a
district
court
by
the
labor
department
did
not
bear
out
the
labor
department's
intention
in
this
respect.
it
is
purely
a
local
firm
with
the
branch
office
in
washington.
now,
i
said
at
the
out
set
that
the
labor
department
had
launched
the
two
prong
attack
upon
this
firm
and
i
say
that
advice
only
because
–
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
--
i've
said
that
the
department
of
labor
launched
a
two-pronged
attack
against
that
firm,
the
firm
that
we
represent
and
i
used
that
divisively
for
this
reason
that
both
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
department
of
labor
stressed
the
point
that
plans
and
specifications
were
goods.
that
was
their
main
frontal
attack.
they
set
out
i
think
to
prove
that
plans
and
specifications
were
goods
if
they
could
and
of
course
they
did
not
succeed
in
either
tribunal.
failing
that,
and
as
a
second
prong
of
the
attack
was
the
contention
that
the
employees
of
this
firm
were
engaged
in
commerce.
i
note
that
in
the
appeal
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
the
--
the
seal
has
been
slightly
reversed
and
now
the
first
frontal
attack
is
that
the
employees
are
engaged
in
commerce
and
secondly,
we
meet
the
issue
that
plans
and
specifications
are
goods.
i
should
like
to
say
at
outset
that
--
and
i
think
it
should
be
clearly
understood,
that
our
clients
in
this
case,
the
respondent
--
respondents
are
independent
art
--
architects
and
engineers.
case
after
case
in
the
various
courts
of
appeal
have
been
resolved,
some
one
way
and
some
the
other
where
draftsmen
and
chainmen
and
other
people
who
do
the
same
type
of
work
that
our
employees
do
who
are
employed
by
contractors.
i
think
there
is
not
a
large
contractual
firm
that
doesn't
employ
chainmen
and
draftsmen
and
other
people
similarly
to
those
employed
by
an
independent
firm,
but
we
think
that
under
the
act,
it's
very
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
fact
because
we
get
to
the
question
eventually
of
remoteness
to
bear
mind
in
the
fact,
that
the
firm
that
we
represent
the
defendants
in
this
case
as
originally
brought,
do
not
participate
in
any
construction
whatsoever.
they
--
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
their
having
any
job
site
engineers
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
their
participating
actively
in
any
construction
work
at
all.
now
with
that
as
a
background
i
should
like
first
to
direct
my
argument
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
plans
and
specifications
are
goods
under
this
act.
i'd
like
to
say
here
that
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
a
single
court
in
the
country
that
has
held
that
plans
and
specifications
are
goods.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
in
the
brown
case
mr.
justice
it
was
particularly
held
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
brown
case
that
we
will
not
pass
upon
that
point
because
we
will
hold
that
the
employees
are
engaged
in
commerce
and
the
judge
in
the
brown
case
particularly
said
that
he
wouldn't
decide
whether
or
not
plans
and
specifications
are
goods.
he
wasn't
called
upon
to
pass
on
that
fact.
the
case
that
we
think
is
the
leading
exposition,
in
other
words,
in
the
brown
case
--
we
think
the
case
that
is
the
leading
case
on
this
point
in
that
it
discusses
the
matter
or
one
of
the
leading
cases
because
judge
learned
hand
did
in
a
case
dealing
with
the
--
not
with
plans
and
specifications
but
with
a
--
a
similar
typewritten
manifestation.
in
the
--
in
the
case
that
the
appellant
refers
to
as
the
old
turpin
case,
which
is
a
district
court
case
decided
by
judge
chesnut
down
in
baltimore.
he
went
into
the
matter
in
great
detail
and
we
think
with
a
great
deal
of
effectiveness
and
conviction
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
should
like
to
read
what
judge
chesnut
said.
this
is
case
is
mccomb
against
turpin.
it's
in
81
f.supp.
86
and
i'm
reading
from
that
brief.
judge
chesnut
with
impressive
clarity
and
reason
then
he
explained
why
plans,
drawings,
and
specifications
are
not
goods.
they
are
only
a
physical
embodiment
in
words
of
professional
conclusions.
the
opinion
continues
in
the
words
of
justice
holmes
in
federal
base
ball
club
of
baltimore
against
national
league
of
professional
base
ball
clubs,
259
u.s.
200
and
i
quote,
“personal
effort,
not
related
to
production,
is
not
a
subject
of
commerce.
that
which
in
its
consummation
is
not
commerce
does
not
become
commerce
among
the
states
because
the
transportation
that
we
have
mentioned
takes
place.
a
firm
of
lawyers
sending
out
a
member
to
argue
a
case,
on
the
chautauqua
lecture
bureau
--
or
the
--
or
the
chautauqua
lecture
bureau
sending
out
lecturers,
does
not
engage
in
such
commerce
because
the
lawyer
or
lecturer
goes
to
another
state.
certainly
the
word
goods
could
not
be
construed
to
include
professional
advices
and
its
definition
should
not
be
construed
to
include
the
type-written
or
mechanical
expression
by
which
the
advice
is
given.
now
that
was
the
opinion
of
judge
chesnut
on
plans
and
specifications
which
we
think
is
the
only
case
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
and
i
think
our
adversary
certainly
would
have
found
the
other
if
he
could
tell
the
other
way,
this
is
the
only
case
we've
been
able
to
find,
dealing
directly
with
plans
and
specifications.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
i
think
it
will
probably
sweep
them
all
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
it
would
try
to
sweep
under
it
all
of
the
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
i
should
say
it
would,
yes.
if
plans
and
specifications
are
goods
i
think
it
would
keep
everybody
and
the
employee
under
that.
certainly
it
wouldn't
include
the
professional
employee
that
they're
specifically
exempt.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
but
i
think
it
would
include
the
field
men.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
that's
correct
yes.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
--
that
question
will
have
to
be
resolved
i
think
as
to
whether
not
the
work
is
remote
on
that
--
whether
it's
in
a
direct
causation,
whether
it's
directly
essential
or
not,
but
the
i
think
if
plans
and
specifications
are
goods,
we
certainly
from
time
to
time
send
some
plans
and
specifications
across
state
lines.
now,
we
don't
do
much
of
that.
most
--
most
of
that
which
is
done
by
our
client
is
done
by
the
government,
but
we
do
some
of
it.
i
think
the
record
will
show
and
in
our
brief
that
we
do
a
little
bit
in
2%
of
cases
do
we
send
plans
and
specifications
across
the
state
line,
but
if
plans
and
specifications
are
goods,
i
would
say
that
--
engaged
that
the
--
that
we
ship
them
across
the
state
lines
in
2%
of
the
cases.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
we
think
that
the
telegram
in
the
leonard
case
well,
we
omit
in
our
brief
and
judge
soper
met
that
in
his
opinion.
we
think
that
the
telegram
is
a
subject
of
commerce
undoubtedly.
and
we
think
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
sir?
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well
the
court
held
that
is
was
the
subject
of
commerce
and
therefore
came
under
the
act.
of
course
--
that
was
the
child
labor
act
i
think
it
was
in
term
then,
but
the
difference,
but
the
distinction
i
think
is
--
is
that
if
we
were
representing
a
firm
that
was
preparing
plans
and
specifications
and
advertising
in
magazines
for
sale,
we
would
think
then
that
we
would
be
producing
--
goods
under
this
act.
but
we
say
that
all
we're
doing
is
the
same
thing
that
a
lawyer
does
when
a
he
gives
a
written
opinion
that
we're
taking
the
professional
expression
of
a
professional
advice
and
resolving
to
a
written
instrument
and
that
it
has
no
particular
value,
no
value
at
all
except
for
the
person
for
whom
it
is
prepared.
now
that
isn't
true
with
the
people
who
were
sent
out
selling,
compiling
and
selling
standard
plans
and
specifications
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
we
don't
think
the
act
should
cover
a
lawyer's
secretary,
no
sir.
we
don't
think
so
because
we
think
that
is
too
incidental
to
what
she
does.
we
think
that
it
is
not
directly
essential
to
the
works
of
a
lawyer.
it's
--
it's
--
and
we
would
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
in
a
moment
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
if
you
want
me
so.
in
the
meantime
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well
of
course,
your
honor,
it
isn't
because
these
do
too.
as
judge
chestnut
said
in
his
opinion,
this
is
not
the
mischief
that
the
act
was
meant
to
remedy.
there
isn't
anybody
being
employed
of
--
of
--
who
doesn't
make
a
lot
more
money
than
you
would
ordinarily
expect
a
minimum
wage
employee
to
make.
the
point
is
at
the
time
when
they
have
overtime
it
makes
you
so
(inaudible)
regardless
of
how
much
they
making
at
the
time.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
on
that
so
on
that
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
i
know
that
but
i
just
--
we're
not
dealing
on
that
pay
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
now,
along
that
line
in
as
to
why
these
plans
and
specifications
are
not
goods
i
would
like
with
the
court
permission
to
quote
a
small
portion
of
judge
soper's
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
we
think
that
deals
directly
with
this
question
and
as
expressed
(inaudible)
we
ourselves
can
express
and
i'm
recording
this
is
from
page
147a
of
the
record.
certainly
the
words
“goods”
could
not
be
construed
to
include
professional
advices
and
its
definition
should
not
be
construed
to
include
the
typewritten
or
mechanical
expression
by
which
the
advice
is
given.
these
plans,
drawings
and
specifications
are
not
themselves
the
subject
of
border
or
sale
but
only
the
written
embodiment
of
professional
advice
incidental
thereto
--
and
incidental
thereto.
they
are
specifically
prepared
to
meet
the
particular
problem
of
specific
plan
and
are
not
sold
or
offered
for
sale
to
the
public
generally.
they
are
of
course
quite
unlike
stocks,
bonds,
and
commercial
paper
which
call
themselves
instrumentalities
of
commerce,
bozant
against
bank
of
new
york.
this
distinction
was
well
made
by
circuit
judge
learned
hand
in
the
case
cited
the
156
f.2d
789
as
follows.
some
of
the
activities
which
went
on
we
agree
should
on
no
theory
be
counted.
a
lawyer
who
in
the
course
of
his
practice
writes
letters
or
draws
deeds
or
wills,
(inaudible)
in
the
record,
is
not
on
that
account
within
203
(j)
and
the
same
as
true
of
the
correspondence
of
a
broker
and
of
a
banker.
and
if
your
honor
please
that,
is
we
come
to
that
--
we
think
would
obtain
to
lawyers
analogous
as
well
as
to
us
analogous
too
incidental.
the
definition
of
goods
in
203
(i)
might
literally
go
so
far
even
as
that,
but
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
the
last
degree
to
suppose
that
congress
meant
to
cover
such
incidents
of
a
bidder
whose
purpose
did
not
comprise
the
production
of
goods
at
all.
and
if
your
honor
please
that
we
think
it
disposes
of
the
question
and
we
think
it
disposes
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
plans
and
specifications
are
goods.
we
think
the
judge
chestnut's
opinion
and
judge
hand's
opinion
in
the
absence
of
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
leads
us
to
believe
that
it's
just
with
these
two
judges
--
that
they
are
just
what
these
two
judges
say
they
are,
typewritten
manifestation
or
expressions
if
you
will
of
professional
ideas.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well
of
course
the
--
the
plans
and
specifications
that
we
turned
over
to
the
government
the
government
did
send
from
place
to
place
to
get
contractors
to
bid
on
it.
they
sent
them
themselves,
but
we
don't
think
that
that
means
they
are
goods
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
there
were
no
great
benefits,
if
the
government
wanted
to
build
a
particular
way
to
the
particular
place
and
we
do
a
planned
specification
for
it
which
we
did
as
a
part
of
their
advanced
planning,
in
many
instances
the
place
was
never
built
at
all.
now
our
professionals
--
professional
men
of
the
firm
would
get
paid
for
those
plans
and
specifications.
what
the
government
did
with
them
we
don't
know.
we
do
believe
and
i
think
the
record
shows
--
i
mean
it's
not
about
business.
we
know
as
a
matter
of
practice
the
government
very
often
distributes
them
for
bids.
i
mean
they
mail
them
and
they
(inaudible)
for
bids,
but
that
was
accurate
that
left
our
ends.
now
we
did
that
to
vary
and
we
did
--
the
clients
themselves
would
do
that,
but
the
plans
that
we
turned
over
to
the
government
was
ours,
but
we
don't
think
that's
the
same
as
making
them
--
that
that
makes
them
goods.
we
think
still
what
judge
chestnut
did,
we're
still
with
judge
hand
said
that
it's
a
professional
thing
and
after
all
professionals
are
exempt
under
the
act.
now
if
the
professionals
who
in
--
in
architects
and
engineers
engrave
them,
those
professional
men
make
plans
and
specifications.
they
have
them
prepared
in
their
office
or
do
it
themselves
in
some
instances
they
do,
you
can't
afford
(inaudible)
and
then
they
send
those
and
have
them
blueprinted.
now
we
don't
think
the
fact
and
we
don't
think
if
there's
any
law
anywhere
although
the
labor
department
contends
that
that
makes
them
goods
just
because
anymore
than
a
lawyer's
brief
would
be
goods.
they're
no
goods
as
i
said
to
anybody
except
to
particular
person
who
is
employed
with
professional
architect
and
engineer
for
that
particular
work.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
yes
all
professionals
are
exempt
for
a
sale.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well,
we
know
of
no
administrative
case
where
--
that
there
was
no
administrative
case
that
have
been
brought
to
our
attention
where
a
lawyer's
secretaries
have
been
placed
under
the
act.
now
maybe
sometimes
they
have
no
--
they're
no
--
there's
no
case
of
--
i
don't
think
there's
no
reported
case
of
any
such
things
that
have
occurred.
we
--
we
contend
that
if
--
if
our
plans
are
brought
under
the
act
that
--
that
there
is
no
professional
exempt.
lawyers
and
doctors
and
artists,
the
man
who
paints
the
picture
and
the
lawyer
who
draws
a
brief
and
the
doctors
who
performs
the
operation
and
who
makes
the
autopsy
all
of
them
must
read
into
the
laws
of
fair
labor
standard
act.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
make
(inaudible)
and
we
don't
think
of
courts
(inaudible).
we
just
think
that
those
fine
lines
that
have
been
drawn
from
time
to
time
between
cases
would
just
be
eliminated
so
far
as
professions
are
concerned.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
no
sir.
no
your
honor.(voice
overlap)
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
yes,
sir.
absolutely,
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
no,
sir
we
don't
think
it
does
follow
for
this
reason
as
i
said
earlier
and
that
we
think
that
a
construction
company
does
it
engage
directly
engaged
in
--
referring
to
an
instrumentality
of
commerce.
now
we
think
that
a
--
a
professional
man
will
say
who
was
engaged
or
who
gets
up
with
business
of
selling
plans,
you
see
them
advertised
in
all
the
magazines,
standard
plans,
standard
blueprints
and
specifications
for
homes
on
certain-sized
lots.
now
we
think
if
they
are
employees
and
are
invariably
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
that
they
should
be
under
the
act.
but
we
don't
think
that
a
lawyer's
stenographer
should
be
under
the
act
and
we
think
it
has
not
been
intended
by
congress.
i
mean
the
--
from
the
walling
case
on
who
this
court
has
time
and
time
again
said
that
congress
did
not
make
this
act
all
extensive.
judge
learned
hand
said
so
that
they
fiddle,
but
they
didn't
and
until
such
time
as
they
do
we
think
that
employees
such
as
we
represent
are
intended
for
exemption.
now
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we're
in
no
position
to
affirm
or
deny
that.
we
don't
know.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
no
sir,
but
we've
never
seen
any
of
that.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well,
that
is
a
matter
--
served
in
last
but
usually
within
her
knowledge
and
the
knowledge
is
very
far,
the
reason
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
deny
it.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well
we
do
say
that
we
know
nothing
about
it
and
i
do
say
that
as
far
as
any
law
which
is
in
my
hometown
is
concerned,
i've
never
heard
of
any
them
for
being
approached
by
the
department
of
labor
to
find
out
whether
they
are
secretaries
working
more
than
40
hours
a
week.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
no
sir.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
no
sir.
in
fact
it's
accepted
(inaudible)
now,
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
proceed
with
the
question
as
to
whether
of
not
our
employees
are
engaged
in
commerce.
we
contend
that
they're
not.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
pointed
out,
we
are
not
engaged
in
any
construction
work.
we
are
independent,
professional
architects
and
engineers
and
that
what
we
do
for
anything
that
is,
has
an
interstate
characteristic
or
aspect
is
too
remote
from
it,
by
virtue
of
our
insulation
from
it
to
be
included
within
the
act
and
i
should
like
with
court's
permission
just
to
read
a
--
a
few
lines
from
the
callus
case
to
which
with
ms.
margolin
referred
in
regard
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
and
a
part
of
this
opinion
was
quoted
by
judge
--
judge
soper
in
his
opinion.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
yes
sir.
merely
because
an
occupation
involves
a
function
not
indispensible
to
the
production
of
goods
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
done
without,
does
not
exclude
it
from
the
scope
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
conversely,
merely
because
an
occupation
is
indispensible
in
the
sense
of
being
included
in
the
long
chain
of
causation
which
brings
about
so
complicated
result
as
finished
good
does
not
bring
it
within
the
scope
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
in
giving
a
fair
application,
i'm
reading
on
page
582
of
the
opinion,
in
giving
a
fair
application
to
3
(j),
courts
must
be
remember
that
the
necessary,
in
a
phrase,
“necessary
to
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce”
is
covered
by
the
context
not
only
of
the
terms
of
this
legislation,
but
of
its
implications
in
the
relation
between
state
and
national
authority,
kirschbaum
against
walling,
for
as
it
pointed
out
walling
against
jacksonville
paper
company,
we
cannot
be
in
module
with
congress
in
enacting
this
statute
plainly
indicated
its
purpose
to
leave
a
local
business
to
the
protection
of
the
states.
we
must
be
alert
therefore,
not
to
absorb
by
adjudication
essentially
local
activities
that
congress
didn't
deem
fit
to
take
over
by
legislation
and
then
skipping
a
sentence,
we
come
to
the
part
that
ms.
margolin
referred
to
as
being
incorporated
in
judge
soper's
opinion,
“mere
separation
of
an
occupation
from
the
physical
process
of
production
does
not
preclude
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
but
remoteness
of
a
particular
occupation
from
the
physical
process
is
a
relevant
factor
in
drawing
the
line.
running
an
office
building
as
an
entirely
independent
enterprise
is
too
many
steps
removed
from
the
physical
process
of
the
production
of
goods.
such
remoteness
is
insulated
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
by
those
considerations
pertinent
to
the
federal
system
which
led
congress
not
to
sweep
predominantly
local
situations
within
the
confines
of
the
act.
to
assign
the
maintenance
men
of
such
an
office
building
to
the
productive
processes
because
some
proportion
of
the
offices
in
the
building
may,
for
the
time
being,
be
offices
of
manufacturing
enterprises
is
to
indulge
in
an
analysis
too
attenuated
for
appropriate
regard
to
the
regulatory
power
of
the
states
which
congress
saw
fit
to
reserve
to
them.”
if
your
honor
please
we
think
that
insulation
that
was
spoken
of
in
that
case
with
those
maintenance
men
also
applies
to
us.
there's
no
direct
relationship
between
our
work
and
the
contractors
who
build
the
goods.
we
think
that
it's
just
as
remote
as
the
--
as
are
the
maintenance
men
in
callus
case.
i
will
like
in
a
few
many
minutes
to
the
elect
for
me
to
distinguish
this
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
none
for
the
government
at
all.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
in
view
of
the
30%
above
other
people
incidentally
the
government
was
that
85%
in
washington,
60%
in
norfolk.
now,
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses
was,
one
of
partners
that
about
50%
of
the
other
work
that
was,
they
had
supervisory,
they
had
supervisory
contract
for
--
but
all
that
supervision
is
done
by
a
professional
man.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
if
they'd
done
that
in
other
states.
i
mean,
most
of
their
work
is
local
in
nature
and
they
don't,
where
they
furnish
supervision,
they
furnish
no
supervision
in
government
contract
at
all,
where
they
furnish
supervision,
it
is
--
it
is
done
by
--
by
a
partner
or
at
least
a
professional
employee
who
is
exempt
anyhow.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well
do
they
--
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
there's
no
doubt,
yes.
mr.
alan
j.
hofheimer
well,
on
occasion,
there
isn't
any
element
in
here
it
having
been
done
this
way.
i
couldn't
say
that
it
isn't,
but
there
isn't
any
evidence
of
any
supervision
that
was
done
for
instance
in
washington
outside
of
maryland
where
that's
over
the
west
end
of
the
washington
office
almost
is
on
a
--
a
residential
sewerage
thing.
it
was
constructed
in
maryland
and
if
any
supervision
had
furnished
that
--
of
course
it's
done
outside
of
the
district.
i
think
there's
no
evidence
of
any
supervision
done
by
the
norfolk
office
outside
of
norfolk.
but
as
i
say
if
we
did,
it
would
be
done
by
a
professional
man
who
would
be
exempt.
now,
the
case,
and
the
only
case
that
we
know
of
and
the
only
case
that
the
government
has
produced
in
support
of
its
position
is
the
eight
circuit
case,
the
brown
case
and
i
would
just
like
to
read
just
one
part
of
the
brown
case
that
i
think
distinguishes
from
this
case
completely.
and
the
judge
said,
he
spoke
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
constituting
in
laudadio
against
white.
and,
that
was
the
case
where
the
draftsmen
in
that
case
were
employees
of
a
contractual
firm.
so
here,
now
this
is
a
judge,
and
this
is
a
case
that
held
and
the
only
case
we
know
that
held
that
an
independent
engineer
was
under
the
act.
so,
here
defendant
employee's
preparation
of
plans
and
specifications
for
the
repair
and
improvement
of
existing
instrumentalities
of
commerce
together
with
the
activities
of
the
resident
engineer
at
the
actual
job
site
was
sufficient
to
bring
him
within
the
coverage
of
the
in
commerce
rights.
now
we
submit
that
we
have
no
evidence
in
this
record
about
having
done
any
work
on
an
existing
instrumentality
of
commerce
nor
is
there
any
record,
any
evidence
in
the
record
about
having
ever
had
a
man
at
a
job
site
a
resident
engineer
at
the
job
site
to
supervise
construction.
we
just
don't
do
it.
we
have
never
done
it
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
we
did
that.
so
we
submit
that
--
that
this
independent
profession
firm
is
not
producing
goods
in
commerce
and
it's
too
remote
to
be
considered
as
an
employee
engaged
in
this.
thank
you.
