department
of

petitioner,

lublin,
mcgaughy
and
associates.
ms.
margolin,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
hofheimer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
hofheimer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
mr.
hofheimer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
hofheimer
can
you
be
a
little
more
--
a
little
more
than
that
here
didn't
work
these
plans
and
specifications
that
went
to
the
government
distributed
to
--
to
prospective
bidders
and
didn't
the
prospective
bidders
use
those
in
determining
whether
they
were
going
to
bid
or
not
and
how
much
they
were
going
to
bid
and
then
when
they
did
bid
then
they
used
those
in
the
construction
of
the
building,
isn't
that
a
little
more
than
just
professional
advice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
lawyers
who
--
who
have
a
national
business
for
instance
who
are
exempted
from
this
act
that
is,
they're
employees
who
are
engaged
in
these
this
services?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
mean
they're
--
they're
employees.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
by
the
same
reason
that
the
employees
of
your
client
are
not
under
the
act,
no
employees
of
professional
people
would
be
under
the
act,
is
that
to
follow?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question
mr.
hofheimer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
your
clients'
character
as
engineers,
do
they
do
any
supervisory
work
on
any
of
these
jobs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
how
about
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
when
they
--
when
they
do
this
in
other
--
in
other
states,
don't
they
use
the
plans
and
specifications?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
he'd
be
used
in
the
work,
would
he
not?
he'd
be
using
the
goods
if
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
these
other
people
have
produced
these
plans
and
specifications.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
just
wondered.
