justice

frankfurter
what
bearing
is
that
on
the
(inaudible)
--
on
the
problem
of
the
case
that
it's
done
for
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
because
of
that,
not
--
all
i
meant
to
ask
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
facts
that
it's
done
for
the
government
as
such
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
as
such
it's
not
(inaudible)
you
can't
associate
but
as
such
is
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
--
the
washington
d.c.
offices
of
new
york
and
chicago
firms?
i
suppose
this
--
i
hope
i
know
but
i
don't.
does
the
statute
apply
in
the
house
of
the
districts
without
any
problems
of
interstate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
my
question
is
taken
care
of
so
to
speak
the
clerical
and
stenographic
reporter
in
washington
offices
or
new
york
and
chicago
firms
wouldn't
raise
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
haven't
--
but
necessary
if
the
act
applies
to
the
different
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
they
do
have
the
same
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
pursue
justice
brennan's
question
have
those
situations
administratively
occurred
namely,
the
clerical
and
stenographic
reporter
that
--
i
don't
know
how
many
in
washington's
substations
of
new
york
and
chicago
firms,
san
francisco
firms
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
covered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
arresting
telegram
--
arresting
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
goods?
justice
felix
frankfurter
goods,
goods
have
very
expansive
meaning
to
the
telegram
is
goods
for
the
--
for
making
up
a
telegram.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
go
on
that
excess
you
will
get
it
from
the
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
amount
of
money
that
seem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
think
of
--
some
of
the
figures
i've
seen
of
lawyers'
exempted
(inaudible)
were
not
lawyers
or
professionals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
can
do
it
--
go
into
that
then
we
must.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hofheimer,
this
might
bother
you.
if
i
heard
it
correctly,
indicated
that
as
a
matter
of
administrative
application,
this
has
been
applied
to
out-of-state
law
officers,
to
their
stenographers
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
that
would
be
controlling
on
you
--
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
an
acceptance
and
she
also
indicated
that
if
the
lawyers
presumably
they
would
have
agreed,
unless
it's
too
trivial,
unless
they
make
so
much
money,
it's
doesn't
matter.
i
wouldn't
know
about
that
but
they
don't
contest
it.
they
didn't
expect
lawyers
to
contest
something
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
that's
into
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down,
ms.
margolin.
the
definition
of
goods
after
giving,
reciting
various
categories
of
what
it
means
to
be
goods,
and
all
of
which
i
want
to
understand
where
products,
commodities,
merchandize
or
other
--
or
subjects
of
commerce
of
any
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
subject
of
commerce
of
any
character
is
the
inclusive
category
which
obtained
everything
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
articles
or
subjects
of
commerce.
does
that
mean
regulations
under
the
commerce
law
are
subject
to
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
we've
held
the
and
you
well
know
(inaudible)
--
isn't
that
extensive
as
the
commerce
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
that's
something
said
in
the
opposite
in
kirschbaum
which
enforces
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
i
happen
to
know
what
i
get
from
your
reply
is
that
the
phrase
or
subject
of
commerce
of
any
character
were
intended
to
construe
--
to
convey
that
the
legal
term
subject
--
subject
of
anything
that
under
the
commerce
clause
maybe
regulated
by
commerce
short
of
the
shreveport
doctrine,
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
jefferson
would
regard
these
--
these
architectural
plans
as
goods
under
this
definition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
architects
who
are
doing
that
protection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
the
court
--
(voice
overlap)
and
this
--
were
adopted
as
you
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
the
act
that
the
commerce
--
it
can
out
of
the
commerce
enforcement.
jefferson's
draft
told
by
some
of
these
or
by
the
auctioneer
from
new
york
that
they
are
articles
of
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
ask
us
to
take
this
case
because
of
it's
conflict
with
brown?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
conflict
point
was
in
this
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
they
raise
it
in
parenthetically
moving
the
equipment,
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
goods
including
marine
equipment.
