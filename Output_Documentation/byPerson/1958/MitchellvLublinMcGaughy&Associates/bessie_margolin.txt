ms.
bessie
margolin
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
the
non-professional
workers
employed
by
an
architectural
engineering
firm.
the
question
is
whether
such
employees
are
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
within
the
statutory
terms
as
specifically
defined
in
the
act.
respondents
are
--
are
on
architectural
engineering
firm
which
maintains
offices
in
two
states,
that
is
at
virginia
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
has
overseas
associates.
its
business
consists
of
preparing
architectural
and
engineering
plans
and
specifications
draft
and
drawing
primarily
for
industrial
and
governmental
projects
as
distinguished
from
residential.
now
though
respondents
take
issue
with
our
characterization
of
the
fact,
i
don't
think
there's
any
substantial
dispute
on
as
to
just
what
those
facts
actually
are.
our
statement
in
the
brief
is
based
largely
on
the
stipulation
of
facts
and
on
the
findings
of
the
two
courts
below.
respondents
admittedly
do
not
confine
their
operations
to
a
single
state
and
those
offices
perform
substantial
work
both
for
out-of-state
clientele
and
for
out-of-state
construction
projects.
it's
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
would
say
that
they
are
fairly
stated
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
is
quite
extensive
and
we
would
say
that
they're
fairly
stated.
they
are
all
somewhat
supplemented
by
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
and
by
the
stipulation.
it's
--
there's
no
question
that
they
deal
with
those
out-of-state
clientele
and
on
out-of-state
projects
and
that
many
of
their
plans
and
specifications
are
prepared
--
transmitted
out-of-state.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
as
to
those
facts.
it's
also
undisputed
as
to
what
these
non-professional
workers
do.
they
do
the
non-routine
--
they
do
their
routine
work,
the
clerical
work
of
routine
draftsmanship
of
the
fields
that
they
work
that
is
necessary
for
the
preparation
of
the
plans
and
specifications.
it's
also
undisputed
that
substantial
amount
of
their
work
is
for
the
federal
government,
most
of
it
is
for
governmental
agencies.
60%
of
the
work
with
the
virginia
office
is
stipulated
is
done
pursuant
to
contract
with
the
united
states
army
and
navy
agencies
and
85%
of
the
washington
office
work
is
done
either
for
the
army
and
navy
or
for
the
state,
municipal
and
government
agencies.
respondents
employed
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it's
the
--
i'm
coming
to
the
fact
that
--
that's
what
require
so
much
of
the
--
of
the
interstate
transmission
of
these
documents.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
and
also
because
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
think
as
such
but
if
--
that
shows
it's
very
likely
to
be
of
a
national
character
and
interstate
in
character.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
associates
that
from
national
and
interstate
commerce.
they
employ
about
65
to
70
employees,
including
professional
and
non-professional,
about
30
in
the
norfolk
office
and
about
20
in
the
washington
office
and
from
15
to
20
employees
overseas.
i
want
to
emphasize
it
because
i
think
there's
some
confusion
over
the
professional
exemption
and
may
have
been
responsible
for
the
decision
below.
but
the
case
is
concerned
only
with
respondents
of
non-professional
employees,
not
with
professional
architects
and
engineers
to
which
qualify
on
this
specific
exemption
in
the
act
for
any
employee
employed
in
a
bona
fide
professional
capacity
of
those
terms
are
defined
and
diminutive
by
regulations
of
the
administrator.
respondents
admittedly
employ
quite
a
number
of
employees
as
clerks
and
(inaudible)
field
men
and
routine
draftsmen.
and
these
employees
engage
in
all
of
the
interstate
activities
that
are
necessary
to
conduct
the
two-state
businesses
with
an
out-of-state
clientele
and
overseas
clientele.
and
there's
no
question
but
what
that
requires
constant
and
practice
both
courts
below
noticed
that
requires
constant
interstate
communication
and
transmission
of
information
and
documents.
now,
the
government's
position
is
that
there's
no
question
but
what
the
activities
of
these
employees,
their
regular
and
substantial
activities,
constitute
both
engagement
in
commerce
and
production
of
goods
for
commerce
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
act
and
within
the
intent
--
the
legislative
intent
in
enacting
those
broad
terms.
the
court
below
with
three
separate
--
three
general
separate
grounds
and
several
subsidiary
grounds
on
which
our
contention
is
based
and
withdrawn
fully
into
the
judicial,
legislative
and
statutory
authority
for
each
of
those
grounds
in
our
brief,
i'm
afraid
are
now
beyond
and
obviously
the
time
for
oral
argument
would
not
permit
going
into
them
in
detail
here.
but
i
believe
that
the
--
the
best
way
to
approach
the
--
the
issue
here
is
to
consider
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
because
i
think
it's
the
same
basic
reasoning
explained
their
ruling
on
each
particular
grounds
of
coverage
which
the
government
advanced.
and
there,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
was
that
none
of
these
employees
--
none
of
the
employees
of
this
firm
were
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
within
the
act
despite
their
findings
and
their
recognition
of
all
their
interstate
activities
of
individual
employees.
that
none
of
them
was
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
because
it
viewed
architectural
engineering
work,
preparation
of
plans
and
specifications
as
to
use
this
term
in
essentially
local
business,
an
independent
enterprise
which
was
engaged
in
an
essentially
local
business
and
that
any
interstate
activities
that
were
required
to
carry
on
that
essentially
local
business
but
took
the
local
character
and
were
not
--
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
intent
despite
the
language,
the
broad
language
of
the
statute,
there
was
no
intent
to
cover
interstate
activities
which
are
merely
incidental
to
an
otherwise
local
enterprise.
now,
we
think
that
the
error
of
that
approach
is
clear
beyond
doubt.
the
court
indicated
that
it
realized
that
both
the
statute
and
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
has
settled
the
principle
that
the
coverage
of
this
act
is
to
be
determined
not
by
the
employer
business
or
by
the
nature
of
this
business
but
by
the
particular
duties
of
the
employee.
the
congress
intended
that
any
employee
who
was
regularly
engaged
in
interstate
activities
within
the
statutory
definition
and
it
said
any
and
each
employee
should
be
paid
the
standard
of
the
act
and
that
this
principle
applied
even
though
the
employer's
business
and
i
think
i'm
quoting,
“even
though
the
employer
was
not
engaged
in
an
industry
for
taking
of
interstate
commerce.”
the
court
was
also
obviously
influenced,
the
court
below,
by
the
professional
--
by
the
fact
that
it
felt
that
professional
work
is
necessarily
--
necessarily
local
apparently.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court.
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
the
district
court
went
almost
entirely
off
on
the
(inaudible)
decision
which
the
--
the
district
court
of
maryland,
and
also
on
the
grounds
that
work
for
military
installations
could
not
be
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
anything
about
either
on
those
grounds
because
i
think
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
this
court's
decision
in
powell
took
any
thunder
out
of
the
argument
that
because
work
is
(inaudible)
it
cannot
be
for
commerce.
the
court
of
appeals
did
though
follow
the
lower
court
to
the
extent
of
adopting
the
reasoning
of
the
--
of
the
maryland
district
court
decision
that
goods
does
not
include
plans
and
specifications
because
they
are
not
ordinarily
sold
commercially
to
the
public
generally,
and
were
not
articles
--
that
they
represented
just
the
embodiment
of
the
idea
and
plan
to
get
to
that.
i
did
want
to
make
it
clear
though
that
all
three
of
the
grounds
of
coverage,
any
one
of
the
three
separately
would
be
sufficient
to
hold
these
employees,
if
you
look
it
to
the
activities
of
the
employees,
with
this
or
either
anyone
of
the
grounds
will
be
sufficient
to
bring
them
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
and
so
that
it
is
apparent
that
the
court
necessarily
went
off
on
an
erroneous
concept
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion,
it
did.
because,
if
it
had
looked
to
the
activities
of
the
employee,
apparently
it
considered
that
the
activities
of
the
employees
were
wholly
irrelevant
that
since
this
was
at
this
unit
and
as
we
say,
it's
contradicted
by
the
record
that
it
certainly
is
not
a
local,
essentially
a
local
enterprise
with
it's
two-state
organization,
its
overseas
association,
its
out-of-state
clientele,
and
it's
out-of-state
projects
and
its
constant
transmission
of
information
materials
across
the
state
lines
that
the
court's
basic
--
factual
assumption
is
contradicted
by
the
record.
but,
even
if
the
court
was
factually
correct
and
if
it
were
an
essentially
local
business,
it
would
not
follow
that
the
employees
engaged
in
the
activity
--
in
interstate
activities
necessary
to
conduct
that
business
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
act
provided
that
they
perform
their
duties
were
regularly
were
the
intestate
activity
and
not
simply
a
sporadic
and
occasional.
now
we
don't
claim
that
because
an
employee
occasionally
has
to
write
letters
to
out-of
--
to
out-of-the-state
for
an
essentially
local
business
and
an
occasional
sporadic
intestate
communication
brings
him
in
within
the
act.
but
we
do
claim
that
where
his
regular
and
substantial
duty
requires
continuous
and
regular
use
of
the
intestate
channels
or
activities
specifically
related
to
intestate
instrumentality,
then,
he
is
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
even
though
substantial
part
or
most
of
the
employer's
business
may
not
be
covered
by
the
act.
now,
they
--
we
think
it's
significant
that
of
all
the
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
on
construing
the
coverage
of
this
act,
that
the
only
one
in
which
the
court
below
found
anything
that
seemed
to
substantiate
its
decision
was
10
e
40th
street,
decatur.
now
that
was
the
office
building's
maintenance
employee's
case
which
this
court
distinguished
from
the
kirschbaum
case,
the
kirchbaum
being
the
earliest
decision
construing
the
coverage
of
this
act
where
the
court
first
announced
the
employee
test
of
coverage.
and
where
the
court
applied
it
there
to
an
independent
enterprise
whose
business
was
certainly
no
more
essentially
local
than
the
business
and
it's
certainly
more
essentially
local
than
the
business
here
because
it
was
maintenance
of
a
--
of
a
building
and
rental
and
maintenance
of
the
building
in
new
york
city
and
in
kirschbaum,
the
court
held
that
the
maintenance
employees'
activities
were
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
despite
the
fact
that
their
employer
was
an
independent
enterprise
and
not
himself
engaged
in
intestate
commerce.
now,
the
case
that
the
court
below
relied
on
was
the
callus
case
which
this
court
distinguished
in
a
five
to
four
decision
i
might
add
on
the
basis
that
the
evidence
of
the
relationship
to
intestate
production
as
a
tenant
was
too
thin
in
callus.
and
it
was
too
thin
because
none
of
the
tenants
carried
on
any
production
in
the
building
and
the
claim
of
relationship
to
commerce
being
only
that
the
few
of
the
tenants
elsewhere
carried
on
for
the
manufacturing
activity.
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
court
below
found
it
necessary
to
rely
primarily
on
that
decision,
if
not
solely,
is
indicative
of
the
error
of
its
reasoning.
it
--
it
was
impressed
apparently
with
some
particular
language
and
particular
language
it
was
impressed
with
in
that
case
was
the
independent
enterprise
--
that
callus
was
an
independent
enterprise
serving
a
general
miscellaneous
customer.
well,
that
language
does
appear
in
there
and
undoubtedly,
that
was
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
case
which
led
the
court
to
think
that
the
–
to
rule,
this
court
to
rule
that
the
maintenance
of
the
building
was
too
remote
from
the
commerce.
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
else
in
the
callus
decision
which
is
at
all
applicable
to
this
case.
in
callus,
neither
the
employer
nor
the
employees
were
engaged
directly
in
any
interstate
commerce.
it
was
just
the
same
relationship
which
was
all
that
was
urged.
and
if
that
language
--
if
that
language
cannot
be
taken
out
as
a
test
of
determining
coverage
of
employees
who
were
directly
engaged
in
interstate
activity,
it's
clear
beyond
doubt
from
the
numerous
decisions
both
from
this
court
and
all
of
too
many
lower
court
decisions
even
to
cite,
holding
the
act
applicable
to
employees
of
businesses
which
are
independent
enterprises
and
which
serve
a
general
miscellany
of
customers.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
stenographers
there,
well
it
was,
the
finding
below
was
that
there
was
constant
communication
required
between
the
two
offices
and
with
out-of-state
clientele.
they
typed
up
the
specifications
and
the
explanations
and
i'm
sure,
your
honors
know
what
these
bulky
specifications
are.
they
did
the
typing,
preparing
of
the
--
of
a
great
deal
of
materials
in
the
specifications.
they
handled
the
office
calls,
they
made
up
the
payrolls
for
both
offices
and
for
overseas
employees,
and
it's
--
in
fact
the
district
court
said
it's
freely
conceded
that
the
clerical
workers
engaged
in
--
in
this
--
regularly
in
this
all
with
interstate
communication
correspondence
and
transmission
of
documents.
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
rely
on
both.
because
they
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
in
this
case,
we
certainly
don't
have
to
rely
on
general
correspondence
although
we
say
it's
certainly
related
to
the
fact
that
this
was
an
interstate
operation.
but,
they
typed
--
they
actually
typed
up
great
part
of
the
materials
that
went
into
the
plans
and
specifications
and
they
handled,
they
put
the
calls,
all
the
interstate
calls
through
as
a
private
line
between
the
two
offices
which
was
in
constant
use
and
they
handled
the
interstate
communications
call.
and
they
took
--
the
bookkeeper's
took
--
prepared
the
payroll
for
all
the
employees
in
the
district
of
virginia
and
overseas,
they
arranged
for
sending
the
checks
out
and
i
believe
the
court
is
bringing
the
findings
as
they
stated
in
the
district's
opinion
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals
will
see
that
there
is
considerable
there
besides
mere
correspondence.
now,
i
don't
want
to
shy
away
from
that
question
because
i
think
that
if
an
employee
is
constantly
engaged
in
handling
the
interstate
correspondence
for
a
friend,
that
that
particular
employee
would
be
within
the
terms
and
coverage
of
the
act.
and
i
base
that
on
the
language
of
the
act
and
the
legislative
history
too
that
this
--
the
language
says
every
employer
shall
pay
each
of
his
employees
and
no
employer
shall
fail
to
pay
at
any
of
--
of
the
employers
for
section
6
and
7.
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
if
you
have
a
law
firm
that
has
a
substantial
out-of-state
clientele
and
does
regularly
or
substantially
have
to
use
its
employees
for
interstate
correspondence
and
communications,
i
don't
think
the
law
firms
themselves
would
be
or
have
been
shocked
to
learn
that
--
that
those
employees
are
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
department
has
held
that
a
law
firm
that
--
that
has
substantial
interstate
clientele
or
substantial
business
where
they
have
employees
who
are
regularly
used
to
handle
that
interstate
correspondence
and
interstate
communication,
those
employees
are
covered.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
that's
explicit.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
it
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
if
there's
constant
communication
between
the
offices
that
they
would
be
clearly
covered.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
it
doesn't
apply
to
these
internally.
no,
no.
they
have
the
same
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
have
the
same
problem.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
certainly
have
had
the
problem
administratively
and
we
held
–
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
have
--
we
held
they
are
covered.
the
things
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
there
has
been
some
litigation
and
--
and
that
some
of
the
districts
courts
and
some
of
the
decisions
were
not
on
the
opposing
counsel
have
--
we
have
not
instituted
actions
out
there.
i
think
they
are
usually
employee
actions
and
a
couple
of
cases
that
have
gone
off
on
the
basis
that
it
was
just
sporadic
and
related
to
one
specific
local,
the
kelly
ford
and
davis
cases
which
where
they
have
one
specific
local
construction
project
and
the
correspondence
related
simply
to
that.
we
have
now
as
i
believe
--
i
have
been
informed
that
we
don't
have
trouble
as
to
those
that
use
employees
continuously
in
interstate
communication.
now,
the
legislative
history
i
think
makes
it
clear
that
--
that
congress
intended
to
bar
to
closing
interstate
channels
of
transportation,
communication
and
transmission
to
close
it
to
employment
under
substandard
conditions.
and
this
language
of
applying
it
to
each
and
any
employee
was
very
deliberately
chosen
over
the
employer
language
and
--
insofar
as
anything
was
spared
about
closing
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
it
was
made
clear
that
congress
intended
to
go
and
as
court
has
said
to
the
farthest
reach
it
intended
to
go
to
the
constitutional
limits
of
prohibiting
any
employer
who
wanted
to
use
the
interstate
channels
of
commerce,
transportation
and
communication.
any
employer
who
wanted
to
use
--
to
use
those
had
to
do
so
under
the
prescribed
labor
standard.
ms.
bessie
margolin
there
is
certainly
as
to
some
of
the
employees.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
might
not
be
true
as
to
--
well,
there
are
usually
two
or
three
grounds
on
each
group
of
employees.
the
field
men
have
considerable
interstate
travel
for
example.
the
draftsman
i
think
would
have
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
prepared
materials
for
these
plans
and
specifications
and
so
the
draftsmen
would
raise
that
in
that
problem.
i
see
that
i
have
only
about
five
minutes
which
i
would
appreciate
reserving
for
rebuttal.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
have
a
slight
amendment
to
make
to
my
statement
as
to
draftsman
here
would
be
covered
with
--
with
the
good
point
would
necessarily
be
drawn
into
it
and
we
also
of
course
rely
on
the
eight
circuit's
decision
that
the
plans
and
specifications
are
--
are
a
part
of
the
improvement
to
the
interstate
instrumentality
for
which
they're
specifically
designed.
now,
we
do
not
construe
the
eight
circuit
as
having
limited
itself
to
the
case
where
the
--
resident
engineer
goes
out.
they
very
--
made
it
very
clear
that
they
regarded
the
plans
and
specifications
as
a
part
of
the
improvement
project
because
every
detail
is
guarded.
every
detail
of
the
--
of
the
construction,
the
materials
that
go
in
to
the
construction
are
guarded
by
these
plans
and
specifications,
but
i
do
want
to
spend
a
little
time
on
the
good
point
because
it's
unquestionably
is
the
as
counsel,
my
adversaries
conceded
that
if
these
plans
and
specifications
are
goods
that
in
itself
would
--
would
cover
all
the
employees
involved
here.
and
we
think
that
the
--
it's
so
clear
that
they
are
goods,
that
even
the
way
respondents
themselves
have
treated
them
are
goods
that
that
alone
should
be
sufficient
to
hold
the
--
that
there
is
coverage
here.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
draftsmen?
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
they
gather
the
--
they
make
the
surveys
and
gather
the
materials
which
are
then
incorporated
into
the
blueprints
and
the
drawings
and
the
plans.
there
--
may
do
--
they
actually
do
the
work
that
goes
into
those
plans
then
those
are
shipped
into
state
of
course,
the
plans
themselves.
now
the
--
in
the
stipulation
it
stipulated
these
plans
and
specifications
are
called
property.
it's
stipulated
that
they
become
the
property
as
when
they
are
prepared
for
the
government
projects.
they
become
the
property
of
the
government.
it's
stipulated
that
for
private
concerns,
they
remain
the
property
of
the
respondents
and
copies
are
given
to
the
clients
so
that
they
can
use
them
later
if
they
need
repairs
on
their
project.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
but
now
the
definition
of
goods
in
this
act
was
certainly
broad
enough
to
cover
any
kind
property.
now
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
what
judge
soper's
reasoning
was.
this
--
his
first
reasoning
and
he
rested
largely
on
the
turpin
case
which
was
the
district
of
maryland
which
was
decided
some
four
years
i
think
before
the
powell
decision
came
down.
the
powell
decision
made
it
very
clear
that
the
act
was
not
limited
to
articles
of
trade.
western
union
had
already
made
it
clear,
it's
true.
that
this
was
--
what
not
was
so
limited,
it
was
specifically
amended,
the
definition
of
goods
so
as
not
to
limit
it
to
all
articles
of
trade
and
in
powell,
this
court
said
congress
was
concerned
with
eliminating
widespread
existence
of
substandard
working
conditions
which
could
be
reached
by
congress
through
its
through
interstate,
through
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
transportation
of
the
products
of
those
conditions.
in
other
words
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
the
work
product
of
substandard
condition
--
of
substandard
conditions
and
there's
no
question
but
what
these
plans
and
specifications
are
the
work
products
of
employees
who
are
doing
routine
work,
they're
the
same
kind
of
workers
that
congress
was
concerned
with
and
in
fact
that
the
plans
and
specifications
are
not
merely
the
architect's
ideas
or
the
engineer's
ideas.
they're
the
composite
of
the
work
of
ordinary
laborers
and
the
architect
and
what
seems
to
be
obvious
here
is
that
because
professional
people
supervise
these
ordinary
laborers,
ordinary
employees
that
therefore
the
employees
should
be
exempt
their
--
as
these
professionals
here.
ms.
bessie
margolin
of
any
kind.
ms.
bessie
margolin
articles
are
subject.
well,
they
put
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
that
they're
intended
to
mean
where
anything
that
was
regular
both
under
the
commerce
clause.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes
and
i
--
and
we
in
out
reply
brief
as
i
think
have
undertaken
to
answer
that
argument
which
we
think
misled
the
court
and
has
misled
a
lot
of
--
of
other
people
and
with
choosing
as
administrative
extent.
we've
gone
into
them
--
which
--
which
may
be
the
forgotten
legislative
history
to
show
what
--
what
congress
did
intend
to
limit
us
to
and
we
did
recognize
that
the
--
that
the
act
is
not
co-extensive
with
the
constitutional
power
but
the
statutory
language
that
congress
showed
insofar
as
they
did
go,
they
did
intend
to
go
the
whole
way
and
this
court
has
said
so
repeatedly.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
don't
think
so.
you
pointed
out
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
you
pointed
out
in
kirschbaum
that
congress
did
not
go
the
whole
way
and
you
pointed
to
the
fact
that
they
have
dropped
the
effect
in
commerce
language
and
they
had
also
dropped
the
specific
provision
which
would
have
covered
intrastate
production,
producers
who
do
not
sell
across
state
line
but
who
would
be
covered
because
they
competed
with
interstate
producers.
those
are
the
two
things
the
kirschbaum
opinion
referred
to
and
we
point
out
that
those
are
the
two
things
that's
about
all
that
congress
intended
was
the
--
not
to
get
the
intrastate
producers
because
everything
else
is
specifically
exempted.
it
did
take
out
that
provision
based
on
the
shreveport
case
but
then
they're
adapted.
now
the
effect
in
commerce
language
was
in
the
house
bill
and
all
these
we
have
gone
through
for
the
benefit
of
the
--
of
the
court
we
have
put
it
in
a
our
reply
brief
and
i
think
that
the
net
result
the
court
will
see
that
actually
the
act
adopted,
went
much
further
than
any
previous
bill
except
for
dropping
the
shreveport
doctrine.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
subject
--
well,
subject
of
commerce
and
as
commerce
is
defined
in
the
act
which
is
transportation,
communication,
transmission
and
thirdly
these
plans
and
specifications
are
subjects
that
can
be
transported
across
state
lines
and
all.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
think
that
i
doubt
if
he
was
--
that
he
was
engaging
in
this
type
of
industrial
act
or
--
this
production.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
of
course
i
think
he
might
have
regarded
it
as
such
if
he
would
--
using
it
in
industry
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
but
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
congress
changed
that
language
to
--
to
get
beyond
just
ordinary
articles.
now
judge
soper
says
nobody
would
ordinarily
think
of
it
as
saying
–
goods,
but
this
court
had
said
specifically
that
congress
adopted
unusual
definition
here
and
they
take
precedence
over
the
ordinary
colloquial
use
--
usage
and
as
i
say
that
there's
no
question
but
what
plans
and
specifications
are
used
for
a
lot
of
things
and
they
all
sometimes
show
that
they
were
regarded
as
property
and
valuable
property.
and
on
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
you're
talking
about
the
commerce
in
the
commercial
sense
which
i
think
judge
soper
was
too
which
doesn't
apply
here.
i
think
the
subject
--
if
--
it
read
before
articles
of
trades
and
congress
took
out
the
trade
and
said
subjects
of
commerce
of
any
character.
and
i
think
that
was
done
deliberately
to
--
because
they
wanted
to
get
a
broad
coverage
in
this
act.
they
didn't
--
they
want
to
keep
within
the
constitutional
scope
and
so
--
insofar
as
it
was
limited,
congress
--
it's
obvious
from
the
debates
that
it
limited
it
only
it
thought
it
might
get
into
trouble
constitutionally.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
was
one
of
the
grounds.
the
other
was
of
its
importance
because
there
are
so
many
architectural
or
engineering
firms
that
--
and
many
employees
that
are
affected.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
conflict
point
was
involved.
the
eight
circuit
did
not
decide
the
goods
point
but
they
held
that
the
plans
and
specifications
were
so
closely
and
vitally
indispensable.
it's
admitted
here
that
the
type
of
structures
on
which
respondents
for
which
they
prepare
plans
couldn't
be
built
without
these
--
without
these
plans.
they
--
they
get
every
detail
of
the
building
and
the
materials
and
everything
else
from
the
plan
and
eight
circuit
held
that
--
that
anything
that
close
to
the
actual
instrumentality
and
its
improvement
is
a
part
of
it.

marine
equipment.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i've
never
looked
up
the
legislative
history
of
that.
