mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
in
this
court
by
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
edward
leon
williams,
was
charged
in
muskogee
county,
oklahoma
of
the
murder
of
tommy
cooke.
the
murder
was
--
have
taken
place
on
june
17th,
1956.on
november
the
19th
of
1956,
the
petitioner
here
pled
guilty
and
received
a
life
sentence
to
the
charge
of
murder
in
muskogee
county.
then
--
then
on
december
17th
of
1956,
approximately,
in
other
words
30
days
after
the
plea
of
guilty
in
muskogee
county
where
he
received
life
for
the
murder,
the
county
attorney
of
tulsa
county
had
the
petitioner
brought
to
tulsa
county
and
there
he
was
charged
with
two
other
crimes.
he
was
charged
with
armed
robbery
and
he
was
charged
with
kidnapping.
the
kidnapping
was
of
this
same
victim
namely
tommy
cooke.
the
kidnapping
took
place
also
on
june
the
17th,
1956.
the
robbery
with
firearms
was
of
another
victim
and
there
is
no
appeal
to
this
court
on
the
robbery
with
firearms.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
kidnapping
prosecution.
on
january
the
30th,
1957
the
petitioner
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
both
of
the
charges,
both
the
armed
robbery
and
the
kidnapping.
at
that
time
a
long
statement
was
made
by
the
county
attorney
and
which
was
set
forth
in
full
in
the
record
of
this
case.
this
is
of
course
an
appeal
from
a
sentence
which
was
entered
by
the
court,
not
by
a
jury
and
entered
on
a
plea
of
guilty.
at
the
same
time
the
petitioner
through
his
counsel
entered
the
record
of
the
trial
judge
in
muskogee
county
who
had
handled
the
previous
murder
conviction
of
this
same
tommy
cooke,
this
was
done
of
course
purposely.
and
the
record
of
the
muskogee
judge
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
record
before
this
court
from
the
point
that
the
petitioner
entered
his
plea
of
guilty
in
muskogee
county.
and
i
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
because
it
indicates
in
there
why
the
trial
judge
in
muskogee
county
gave
this
petitioner
a
life
sentence
for
the
murder
of
this
tommy
robert
cooke.
now,
i
should
also
add
that
the
petitioner
was
represented
by
two
public
defenders
myself
and
mr.
fred
woodson,
we
were
both
assigned
to
the
case
in
about
the
1st
of
january,
1957.
he
had
already
been
arraigned
and
was
then
before
the
district
court.
on
february
the
1st,
the
court
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
50
years
for
the
armed
robbery,
and
as
i've
mentioned
that
was
of
another
victim,
but
the
armed
robbery
occurred
on
june
the
16th,
just
one
day
before
this
kidnapping
that
we
are
appealing
on
and
the
murder.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
one
day
before.
he
received
50
years
for
the
armed
robbery.
then
the
court
sentenced
the
man,
petitioner-defendant,
to
death
for
the
kidnapping.
this
was
on
the
recommendation
of
the
county
attorney
of
tulsa
county.
following
that
--
actually
i
should
also
add
this
that
i
did
not
represent
the
man
at
these
hearings.
you
will
note
in
the
record
that
mr.
fred
woodson,
the
other
public
defendant
represented
the
petitioner
during
the
actual
hearing
before
the
court,
however,
naturally
we
discussed
the
case
thoroughly
and
i
felt
that
we
were
doing
the
right
thing.
following
the
death
sentence
we
gave
notice
of
appeal,
filed
a
motion
for
trial,
which
was
overruled.
we
appealed
to
the
criminal
court
of
appeals,
oklahoma,
briefs
were
filed
and
oral
argument
was
heard.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
the
record
will
show
clearly
that
the
information
on
the
kidnapping
and
the
information
on
the
armed
robbery
and
the
hearings
on
both,
while
the
information
were
separate,
the
hearings
were
combined.
it
--
you
can't
distinguish
actually
between
what's
being
said
about
the
armed
robbery
and
what's
being
said
about
the
kidnapping.
and
for
that
matter,
the
whole
gory
mess
of
the
murder
has
gone
through
again
at
the
kidnapping
hearing.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
in
the
record
the
--
the
sentence,
that
was
by
judge
carroll
in
muskogee
county,
everything
that
he
said
and
everything
that
the
court
reporter
took
down
following
the
entering
of
the
plea
of
guilty
in
muskogee
county
is
reflected
in
the
record
here.
he
recites
in
there
for
instance
that
he
held
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
quash,
at
which
time
evidence
was
presented.
and
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
to
quash
the
information,
yes,
sir,
to
quash
the
evidence
of
the
murder.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
court
apparently
overruled
that.
i
do
not
--
that
is
not
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
our
point
in
introducing
the
record
of
what
was
said
in
muskogee
county
was
simply
to
let
the
trial
court
in
tulsa
county
know
why
a
life
sentence
had
been
imposed
for
the
murder.
and
also
give
him
some
foundation
or
precedent
or
realizing
that
that
was
the
solemn
judicial
determination
of
a
coordinate
trial
judge.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
honor,
the
reasons
given,
there
were
about
three
or
four
reasons.
for
one
--
for
one
thing
and
i
will
concede
this,
the
trial
judge
was
operating
or
proceeding
under
the
mistaken
notion
that
there
had
never
been
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
a
sentence
of
death
for
murder
on
a
plea
of
guilty.
now
he
is
wrong
about
death,
i'll
concede
that
point,
there
have
been
some
three
or
four
cases
where
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
the
death
sentence
has
been
given
for
the
murder
but
he
also
recites
some
other
reasons.
for
one
thing
in
oklahoma,
we
have
a
statute
prohibiting
a
man
being
handcuffed
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
at
one
point
during
the
proceedings
the
selection
of
the
jury
and
they
were
having
a
very
difficult
time
in
paneling
a
jury.
at
one
point
during
the
selection
of
the
jury,
the
man
was
apparently
handcuffed
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
he
recites
that
as
one
reason
in
addition
to,
as
i
say,
the
mistaken
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
there
was
--
there
was
no
trial.
they
had
proceeded
along
with
the
impaneling
of
the
jury
in
anticipation
of
the
trial.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
then
the
man
enters
his
plea
of
guilty
and
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
of
not
guilty,
yes,
sir,
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
weighing
of
course
only
to
the
extent
that
i
can
what
the
trial
judge's
reasons
were.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
and
the
other
reason
that
he
gave
was
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
defendant,
there
were
two
confessions
alleged
here.
now,
i
have
never
seen
the
long
confession.
there
was
apparently
a
long
confession
made,
telling
in
detail
how
these
two
or
three
crimes
came
about.
as
i
say,
i
have
never
seen
those
confessions.
but
the
trial
judge
down
there
who
heard
the
motion
to
quash
these
confessions
and
the
evidence
against
this
man,
tells
and
recites
that
there
were
two
confessions
alleged,
one
of
which
he
says
was
destroyed
and
he
has
never
seen.
the
other
one,
there
was
testimony
that
it
was
gained
only
after
the
petitioner
was
beaten.
those
are
the
reasons
essentially
that
the
trial
judge
recites
for
giving
this
man
the
life
sentence.
and
may
i
make
this
as
clear
as
possible,
the
trial
judge
in
muskogee
county
recites
in
there,
that
i
am
--
he
said
in
effect,
“i
maybe
criticized
for
what
i
am
about
to
do.”
but
he
felt
and
i
am
--
i
admire
courage
of
that
kind.
that
regardless
of
what
the
popular
outcry
might
be,
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing.
no
error
in
that
proceeding
on
the
murder
conviction
is
appointed
to
anywhere
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
then
or
now.
the
only
error
apparently
in
that
proceeding
existed
in
the
minds
of
--
in
the
mind
rather
of
the
prosecutor
of
tulsa
county.
and
the
error
that
he
felt
was
that
this
man
should
have
received
the
death
penalty
for
that
murder.
so
he
brings
it
back,
and
starts
all
over
again.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
honor,
that
is
the
entire
proceeding
on
november
19,
1956
from
the
time
that
mr.
williams,
the
petitioner,
enters
his
plea
of
guilty.
that
shows
all
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
gave
for
giving
a
life
sentence.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
he
was
sent
to
mcalester
to
start
serving
it
and
he
--
mcalester
is
the
state
penitentiary
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
he
will
serve
that
sentence.
he
had
--
that
sentence
had
begun.
he
had
started
to
execute
that
life
sentence.
and
as
i
say,
then
approximately
30
days
after
he
went
down
there
or
30
days
after
he
was
sentenced
in
the
murder,
he
was
brought
back
to
tulsa
county.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that's
right.
and
then
faced
with
these
two
other
charges,
the
armed
robbery,
which
was
of
another
victim,
i
point
that,
and
we
do
not
appeal
from
that,
he
received
50
years
for
that
charge,
and
this
kidnapping
for
which
he
received
the
death
penalty,
which
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
they
were
both
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
if
at
that
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
at
that
time
your
honor
a
plea
of
double
jeopardy
or
double
punishment
was
not
entered,
but
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
it
was
entered.
and
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
considered
that
fact
as
well
as
of
course
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
was
brought
into
the
issue.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor
it
is
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
honor,
it
violates
the
fundamental
fairness
that
is
required
and
that
this
court
has
set
forth
in
more
than
one
opinion,
that
is
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
will
--
i
will
elaborate
on
that
point,
i
hope
to
elaborate
on
that
point
at
some
little
length.
i
should
add
this
too
before
we
get
into
the
merits
of
this.
on
december
1,
1957
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
which
is
a
three
justice
court
rendered
a
two-to-one
decision
in
which
there
was
a
very
strong
dissenting
opinion
written
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record.
the
opinions
are
starting
at
page
--
starting
at
page
39.
and
along
with
that,
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
that
is
also
under
the
rulings
of
our
supreme
court
that
that's
part
of
the
law.
on
page
30
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
no,
sir.
you
--
the
law
can
be
taken
from
any
part
of
the
case.
of
course,
the
--
the
head
notes
put
there
by
the
publisher
are
not
part
of
it.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
the
syllabus
is
written
by
the
court,
your
honor.
along
with
this
opinion
you
will
find
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
nix
starting
at
page
50,
in
which
he
mentions
that
he
--
double
jeopardy
and
along
with
--
there
is
no
question
of
what
they
discussed
and
are
considering
the
due
process
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
intended
that
they
should.
now
of
course
this
--
this
opinion,
two-to-one
opinion
here
affirmed
the
trial
court's
death
sentence,
therefore
i
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing,
which
was
orally
argued
and
in
which
they
again
by
a
two-to-one
decision
affirmed,
again
the
trial
court.
however,
this
time
the
other
justice
affirming
also
wrote
a
special
concurring
opinion
which
is
set
forth
in
here.
i
think
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
starting
at
page
--
actually
at
--
that's
right,
at
page
68,
in
conjunction
with
the
order
again
affirming
their
earlier
holding
and
overruling
our
first
petition
for
rehearing.
a
second
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
following
that
special
concurring
opinion
and
following
their
--
affirming
the
pervious
holding.
now,
i
should
also
add
this
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
of
course
been
in
death
row
as
it's
called
of
the
penitentiary
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
since
--
approximately
february
1,
1957,
when
this
sentence
was
entered.
and
i
should
also
add
that
the
other
public
defender
and
myself
of
course
are
on
the
private
practice
of
law
and
we
are
here
on
forma
pauperis.
and
also
it
should
be
added
that
the
county
attorney
of
tulsa
county
who
prosecuted
this
case
is
now
the
governor
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
i
say
further
in
regard
to
the
facts
that
are
set
forth
by
the
county
attorney
in
this
case,
and
i
will
return
to
this,
but
those
facts
that
are
set
forth
there,
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
say
one
way
or
another
as
to
their
correctness
but
i
cannot.
i
do
not
know
all
of
the
minute
detail
of
how
this
happened.
i
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
is
on
page
--
the
county
attorney's
statement
starts
on
about
page
--
it
starts
on
page
10
of
the
record,
labeled
under
statement
of
facts
on
behalf
of
the
state
read
by
mr.
edmonson.
as
you
note
there,
he
says
therefore
we
have
typed
up
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts
concerning
both
of
these
crimes
and
the
actions
of
this
defendant,
and
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
would
be
admissible
in
court
on
the
trial
of
either
of
these
cases,
and
rather
than
reading
the
entire
thing,
i'll
make
reference
to
it.
well,
the
judge
asked
him
to
read
the
entire
thing.
but
i
call
also
to
your
attention
that
this
is
an
ex
parte
statement
by
the
county
attorney,
it's
unsworn,
un-vouched
for
and
he
does
not
even
name
the
source
of
the
statement.
and
yet
consistently
through
the
statement,
not
once
but
many
times,
the
county
attorney
says,
williams
admitted,
by
williams'
own
statement.
william
said
this
and
william
says
that.
well
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don't
know
where
he
got
that
idea,
because
if
he
ever
talked
to
williams
in
person
i
am
not
aware
of
it
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
if
it
--
if
it
please
the
court,
this
was
not
an
affidavit.
the
man
was
not
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
no,
no.
this
is
tulsa
county.
let
me
make
myself
clear
again.
the
statement
made
by
the
county
attorney
which
is
noted
on
pages
10
through
about
20,
10
through
21,
in
which
he
cites
cases
and
urges
the
death
penalty
for
the
kidnapping.
that
is
in
the
sentence
hearing
in
tulsa
county
on
both
the
armed
robbery
and
on
the
kidnapping.
as
you
will
note,
the
court
is
considering
them
both
at
the
same
time.
and
we
can't
complain
about
that
too
much
because
at
the
time
mr.
woodson
did
not
object
that.
now
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
honor,
i
--
i
feel
this
way
about
it.
considering
the
gravity
and
the
awful
finality
of
a
death
sentence,
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
be
faced
with
an
ex
parte
statement
by
the
county
attorney
upon
which
my
death
penalty
is
going
to
be
affected.
i
think
the
if
the
county
attorney
have
these
admissions
and
these
confessions
as
he
says
he
has,
it
would
have
taken
about
a
brief
moment
to
say,
your
honor,
i
have
the
confessions
here
and
i
introduce
them
into
evidence
and
let
them
become
a
part
of
the
record.
instead,
he
makes
a
long
ex
parte
unsworn,
un-vouched
for,
unverified
in
any
respect,
a
statement.
he
goes
through
the
awful
details
of
this
murder
again
including
the
fact
that
the
gun
was
held
say
six
inches
from
the
back
of
a
man's
head,
including
the
fact
that
the
angle
of
the
bullet
is
such
and
such,
including
every
thing
that
he
possibly
can
about
this
murder.
now,
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
the
courts
of
this
country
and
our
trial
courts
in
our
own
locality
notwithstanding
but
they
are
human
beings,
they
are
subject
to
error.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
your
honor
has
reference
to
in
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
no,
they
were
made,
may
it
please
the
court,
they
were
made
by
mr.
woodson.
mr.
woodson,
the
other
public
defender
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
--
of
course
is
objecting
to
this
ex
parte
statement.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
well,
i
recognize
that
this
is
an
ex
parte
statement
and
i
am
considering
it
as
such.
and
it's
another
thing
to
let
the
record
show
that
you
--
that
you
must
have
considered
it
more
than
just
an
ex
parte
statement.
not
only
did
you
consider
it
but
you
were
moved
by
it,
moved
to
commit
the
error
of
making
the
death
penalty
in
a
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
believe
that
in
reading
what
the
court
in
the
time
of
sentencing,
which
is
at
page
--
i
had
it
marked
in
my
brief
here,
i
can
find
it
a
little
easier.
yes.
i
have
it
marked
in
my
brief
at
page
25
and
i
note
in
my
brief
that
it
comes
from
the
record
at
page
29.
i
have
in
the
middle
of
my
brief
at
page
25
there
a
quotation
from
the
trial
judge
at
the
sentencing
or
the
kidnapping,
the
main
portion
of
which,
of
course
he
can
--
he
tells
how
he's
given
hours
of
consideration
the
facts
which
have
been
alleged
and
so
on,
then
he
says
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
of
course
there
has
been
some
allegation
made
and
that's
another
point
and
of
course
i
have
to
cover.
but
there's
been
the
allegation
made
that
you
see
--
the
trial
court
asked
the
petitioner,
“now,”
he
says,
“you've
heard
the
county
attorney's
statement,
is
there
any
correction
that
you
want
to
make?
is
there
any
--
"
then
in
the
record
the
petitioner
tries
to
correct
some
of
the
errors
and
then
frankly
he
does
not
go
any
further.
the
court
finally
then
says,
"well,
are
those
statements
true?"
the
man
says,
“yes,
sir.”
now,
he
says,
“yes
--
”
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes.
however,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
this,
that
statement
of
the
prosecutor
covers
some
10
pages
or
so
of
the
record.
it's
a
long
statement.
it's
liberally
loaded
with
inflammatory
prejudicial
language.
when
this
petitioner
said,
"yes,
sir,"
in
answer
to
the
categorical
question,
is
it
true
and
correct,
he
made
that
answer
with
the
understanding
that
objections
had
been
entered
and
certainly
they
were
entered
by
his
counsel
to
this
statement.
also,
i
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
certainly
we
did
not
mean
to
waive
the
objection
as
entered
and
very
definitely
we
did
not
mean
to
waive
this
man's
life
away
by
the
mere
answering
of
that
question.
this
court
has
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
--
i'm
glad
that
that
was
approached.
may
i
back
up
a
little
bit.
i
fully
contend
that
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
of
oklahoma
has
probably
misconstrued
that
statute.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i'm
unable
to
say
yes
or
no
to
that
because
i
am
not
sure
what
this
court
has
held,
that's
the
truth
of
matter.
i
go
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
isn't
it
binding
on
this
court,
in
other
words.
[laughs]
well,
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
there'd
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
let
me
back
up
to
this
extent.
if
you
go
back
to
yick
wo
versus
hopkins,
many
years
ago
the
ordinance
there
under
construction
was
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
case
was
considered
there
and
held
that
the
trial
court
in
california
was
correct.
this
court
on
appeal
says
that
all
right
if
--
best
discretion
say
that
we
should
be
bound
by
what
they
say
about
the
ordinance.
but
it
does
not
bind
this
court
from
reconsidering
the
ordinance
as
it
has
been
administered.
and
when
an
ordinance
or
a
statute
of
a
state
has
been
so
misconstrued
and
so
mal-administered
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
and
the
administration
of
a
statute
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
am
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
all
right,
if
the
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
am
trying
to
indicate,
of
course
perhaps
i
am
not
being
successful.
but
i
am
trying
to
indicate
here,
that
the
procedure
used
under
the
statute,
even
if
this
court
feels
or
assuming
that
we
are
bound
here
by
the
construction
of
the
oklahoma
criminal
court
of
appeals,
i
am
trying
to
indicate
and
i
think
that
the
doctrine
of
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
is
broad
enough
to
say
particularly
when
it's
considered
with
many
of
these
recent
illinois
cases
which
have
come
down
from
this
court,
concerning
the
names
of
which
escaped
me.
but
for
instance
the
one
where
we
said
here
that
the
procedure
of
a
state
which
did
not
grant
an
appellate
record
and
so
on
to
a
pauper
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
the
case,
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process
of
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i'm
--
i
don't
want
this
--
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
as
so
construed
and
applied,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
as
applied
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
in
this
--
i'm
only
asking
this
court
to
pass
on
this
case.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
--
if
it
please
the
court,
my
--
my
element
of
discrimination
is
the
long
ex
parte
hearsay
statement
which
even
though
this
court
says
it
can
be
done,
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
cases
which
you
have
cited
in
which
i
am
in
--
couldn't
agree
with
more
at
my
brief,
page
38
and
39,
the
case
of
williams
versus
new
york
there
indicated,
i
quote
from
that
case,
“leaving
a
sentencing
judge
free
to
avail
himself
of
out
of
court
of
information
in
making
such
a
faithful
choice
of
sentence
does
secure
to
him
a
broad
discretionary
power,
one
susceptible
of
abuse”,
of
abuse
in
another
words.
now,
this
is
not
an
improper
turn
signal
case,
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
--
of
a
second
degree
burglary
or
such
as
that.
we're
talking
about
a
capital
punishment
case.
the
court
has
made
distinction
before
in
capital
punishment
cases,
bute
versus
illinois,
you
held
that
you
must
have
counsel
in
any
capital
case
and
how
much
more
true
that
must
be
where
a
capital
punishment
is
actually
inflicted.
now,
one
could
easily
ask,
of
course
then
do
we
want
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
fact
that
this
is
a
capital
case
and
it
might
not
have
been
a
capital
case,
would
we
still
have
appealed,
i
can't
pass
on
that.
but
i
know
the
man's
life
isn't
--
is
going
to
be
taken
here,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
procedures
used,
and
i
want
to
make
this
perfectly
clear.
i
come
to
this
court
not
under
the
mistaken
idea
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
come
here,
we
are
here
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
which
this
court
in
palko
versus
connecticut
and
many
others
has
held
that
there
must
be
fundamental
fairness,
justice.
now,
how
has
that
defined
the
rights
of
--
of
people,
of
individuals
within
a
state,
rights
which
are
basic
to
a
free
society?
that
is
the
problem.
this
case
has
two
aspects
then,
is
this
a
repeated
arbitrary
concerted
attempt
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
to
achieve
the
death
penalty
for
a
crime
taking
in
--
and
keeping
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
man
has
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
he's
been
sentenced
for
the
ultimate
crime.
and
i
don't
--
i
have
never
seen
any
dissertation
on
it
but
i
doubt
if
we
can
have
very
much
a
difference
of
opinion
about
the
fact
that
murder
in
its
awfulness
is
probably
the
ultimate
crime
that
be
--
that
can
be
committed
by
man.
if
we
take
the
ultimate
crime,
then
prosecute
for
every
crime
which
is
part
of
that
transaction
simply
because
we
feel
that
some
error
and
i
don't
mean
an
error
of
law,
i
simply
mean
an
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
in
muskogee
county,
if
one
could
say
that.
frankly,
i
don't
feel
there
was
any
error
on
the
part
of
that
trial
judge
in
muskogee
county.
i
think
he
was
doing
what
he
considered
his
solemn
duty
and
regardless
of
public
criticism.
and
believe
me,
this
case
as
you
can
well
imagine
raised
an
awful
lot
of
human
cry
as
people
have
always
done
for
in
effect
crucify
the
man
throughout
the
state.
now,
this
judge
knew
of
that,
still
he
gives
him
a
life
sentence.
now
in
the
minds
of
certain
other
people
including
the
broad
populace
of
our
fine
state,
that
wasn't
good
enough.
let's
start
all
over
again,
isn't
there
some
other
crime
or
crimes
that
we
can
bring
against
him?
we'll
try
it
again.
murder
is
a
capital
offense
in
oklahoma.
kidnapping
carries
from
10
years
to
death
in
oklahoma.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
set
forth
in
my
brief
at
page
two,
oklahoma
statutes
1951,
title
21,
section
745.
i
also
set
forth
there
for
the
court's
information
section
701
of
the
same
title,
which
defines
murder
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
also
the
statutes
which
our
criminal
court
of
appeals
construed
about
the
sentencing
procedure
are
also
set
forth.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
the
statute
allows
our
court
to
reduce
or
modify
sentences,
their
answer
to
that
--
to
our
plea
on
that
basis
was,
that
this
court
won't
extend
mercy,
that's
for
the
governor.
well,
i
do
want
to
call
this
to
your
attention.
the
pardon
and
parole
board
will
not
very
likely
be
extending
any
mercy
in
this
case
seeing
as
how
the
man
who
prosecuted
is
now
the
governor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
to
reduce
and
modify,
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
no.
they
--
they
merely
meant
that
they
wouldn't
extend
mercy.
that
--
they're
drawing
the
fine
line
of
distinction
there
between
what
is
mercy
and
what
is
actually
a
justifiable
modification
of
a
sentence.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
is
exactly
my
contention
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
it
is
on
that
basis
your
honor
and
may
we
read
just
a
little
further
there.
it
is
the
court's
opinion
that
there
has
never
been
in
the
history
of
tulsa
county
a
more
brutal
vicious
crime
committed,
this
crime
to
which
you
have
pled
guilty
here.
well,
that's
just
not
so.
what
he
was
thinking
of
is
the
murder.
what
he
had
in
his
mind
during
this
entire
sentencing
was
the
murder.
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
is
in
my
humble
judgment
of
thinly,
thinly
disguised
repeated
prosecution
again
for
the
murder.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
by
definition
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
of
course
if
--
if
i
can
see
that
fact,
i
concede
myself
in
effect
into
a
corner
perhaps.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
in
a
hypothetical
case
it
may
be
possible
to
prosecute
a
man
under
our
law
for
these
various
criminal
offenses,
but
i
say
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
do
so
purely
on
the
basis
of
the
ultimate
crime
and
to
again
sentence
the
man
for
the
ultimate
crime
which
is
what
they
are
doing
here.
the
maximum
ever
given
in
our
state
before
for
kidnapping
was
30
years.
if
you
average,
there
are
only
five
previous
cases
and
incidentally
each
one
of
those
cases,
i
have
cited
them
in
my
brief,
each
one
of
those
cases
was
decided
since
we
amended
our
statute
which
was
in
about
1935
following
the
lindbergh
act.
each
one
of
those
cases,
one
of
them
in
particular,
the
defendant
had
a
previous
record
of
a
couple
of
murders
and
another
armed
robbery.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
was
in
the
federal
court.
i
have
--
incidentally,
i
have
tried
to
limit
myself
here
to
state
court
cases.
i
--
i
certainly
don't
want
to
get
off
on
constructions
of
acts
of
congress
and
such,
and
we
have
none
here
unfortunately.
that
case
that
i
have
referenced
to
is
norris
versus
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
jury
--
jury
gave
him
30
years
in
that
case.
now,
i
admit
we
have
inflation
in
everything
but
we
ought
not
to
have
inflation
in
the
--
in
the
sentences
that
we
give
a
man
so
that
what
was
30
years
sometime
back
is
now
a
death
penalty.
in
any
event,
our
kidnapping
statute
and
the
legislature
had
this
in
mind
when
they
enacted
it,
allows
from
10
years
to
death.
and
they
didn't
mean
that
per
se
the
statute
or
any
time
you
have
a
kidnapping
case
that
it
has
to
be
a
death
penalty.
i
have
cited
many
cases
in
my
brief
even
early
cases
that
point
out
the
fundamental
unfairness
of
this
case.
as
i
say,
the
case
has
two
aspects.
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
arbitrary
attempt,
the
concerted
effort
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
to
make
sure
that
this
man
gets
the
death
penalty
and
therefore
brings
a
repeated
prosecution
is
a
violation
of
due
process
in
its
most
fundamental
sense.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
starting
in
tulsa
county.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
under
the
definition
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
under
the
statutory
definitions,
two
distinct
crimes
by
virtue
of
the
statutes
were
committed.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
all
over
again.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
am
glad
that
that
--
it's
another
point
i
need
to
make.
i
naturally
recognize
the
value
of
considering
prior
convictions
in
sentencing
a
man.
i
don't
condone
crime.
i
do
know
that
the
court
has
the
right
to
consider
prior
crimes.
i've
heard
it
done.
i
have
represented
people
where
it
has
been
done.
but
the
way
it's
done,
the
court
will
ask,
does
this
man
have
any
past
record?
now
the
fbi
report
or
some
other
evidence
usually
particularly
in
a
serious
case,
considering
the
gravity
of
a
capital
case
for
instance,
ordinarily
a
county
attorney
or
someone
else,
or
the
court
custodian
of
records
will
come
forth
and
say,
this
man
in
1952
was
convicted
of
second
degree
burglary,
he
served
two
years
in
the
state
penitentiary
of
missouri
or
wherever
it
might
have
been.
but
he
doesn't
--
suppose
the
man
had
been
convicted
once
before
of
a
murder,
the
court
in
considering
prior
convictions,
does
that
give
the
court
the
right
to
say,
"well
now,
let
me
see
what
were
the
circumstances
of
the
murder,
let
me
judge
again."
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
have
it
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
--
your
honor's
memory
is
correct,
i
believe
to
that
--
to
that
extent
except
there
is
one
other
factor
that
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
case
on,
and
that
is
that
the
report
was
requested
by
the
court
there
and
under
a
statutory
procedure
which
authorized
and
encouraged
the
courts
to
consider
the
past
record.
but
it
was
made
by
an
officer
of
the
court,
not
a
prosecutor.
it
was
made
as
you
recall
by
a
probation
worker
and
this
court
said,
“probation
workers
making
reports
of
their
investigation
have
not
been
trained
to
prosecute
but
to
aid
offenders.”
now,
i
say
that's
entirely
different
from
a
allowing
prosecuting
attorneys
in
coming
forward
and
giving
all
of
the
gory
details
of
every
crime
that
they
can
find
on
records
to
make
sure
they
--
that
they
have
judge,
that
they
mislead
the
judge
frankly
into
the
error
of
giving
this
man
a
sentence
that
the
prosecutor
personally
wants.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
in
that
particular
case
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
they
have,
your
honor,
in
oklahoma
procedure,
the
jury
can't
fix
the
sentence.
if
they
cannot
arrive
at
the
sentence
then
it
can
be
left
to
the
judge.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
before
the
jury?
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
before
the
jury?
of
course
that
gets
to
the
fundamental
problem
that
we
had
in
ciucci
versus
illinois
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
introduce
any
evidence
you
want
to
at
any
crime
as
part
of
the
same
transaction.
i
know
this
and
had
we
gone
to
trial
on
this
kidnapping
i
would
have
objected,
seriously
objected
to
the
introduction
of
the
gory
details
of
this
murder
all
over
again.
when
you
consider
this
kidnapping
if
you
want
to
break
these
things
down
into
their
separate
elements
and
convicting
say
along
the
way
he
also
carried
a
concealed
weapon
and
you
want
to
convict
him
apparently
a
concealed
weapon.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
was
--
i
was
merely
trying
to
answer
the
court's
question
here
as
to
what
would
have
happened
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
i
--
i
say
that
this
is
a
different
thing,
but
i
say
that
this
discretion
that
we
want
to
allow
these
trial
judges
is
subject
to
abuse.
i
--
it's
subject
to
error
and
mistake.
and
one
other
thing
please,
i
do
not
wish
to
base
my
whole
case
on
the
fact
that
this
county
attorney
came
in
and
made
this
long
statement
as
incredible
as
i
think
it
is,
that
we
allow
a
man
to
receive
the
death
penalty
based
on
that
kind
of
a
statement.
i
wouldn't
want
it
and
i
don't
think
anyone
in
this
court
would
want
that
were
our
places
exchanged.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
no,
i
say
--
i'm
glad
you
raised
that
because
i
want
to
say
that
i
do
not
base
my
whole
case,
i
do
not
want
to
attach
an
over
importance
on
that.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
the
mere
fact
that
he
--
this
is
what
the
--
your
honor
means
is
this,
i
--
i
believe
that
he
could
--
he
could
have
considered
that
this
man
had
also
committed
a
murder
and
that
he
received
a
life
sentence.
not
only
could
he
have
done
that
but
he
was
duty
bound
to
do
that,
and
also
consider
that
it
was
the
part
of
the
same
transaction
that
a
coordinate
trial
judge
had
given
the
man
the
life
sentence.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
doubt
it
your
honor,
because
we
need
something.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
in
the
ciucci
versus
illinois
--
ciucci
i
guess
it
is.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
ciucci.
i
--
well,
in
any
event,
in
that
case
this
--
this
court
in
a
divided
opinion
did
say
that
if
we
could
find
something
that
announced
the
determined
purpose
to
prosecute
the
petitioner
until
the
death
sentence
was
obtained,
then
that
would
be
another
matter.
and
two
of
the
justices
who
were
on
the
affirming
side
of
the
case,
of
the
split
decision
said
that
if
there
were
matters
in
the
record
set
forth,
that
is
if
established
would
require
a
ruling
that
fundamental
and
fairness
existed,
then
they
would
--
they
might
consider
it
otherwise,
and
that's
why
i'm
here.
because
i
think
there
is
fundamental
unfairness,
not
--
not
in
just
one
respect,
not
in
just
this
statement,
i
mean
in
examining
the
record
as
a
whole,
starting
with
the
basic
proposition
of
how
illogical,
how
fundamentally
unsound
it
is
to
give
a
man
a
life
sentence
for
murder,
turn
right
around,
and
give
him
the
death
for
the
kidnapping
of
the
same
victim.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
--
i
believe
that
the
venue
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
would
make
no
difference.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
think
the
same
application
would
apply
here.
let
me
make
one
other
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
--
that
they
--
that
they
could
not,
because
if
they
did
it
the
way
they
did
it
here,
and
that
is
let's
go
through
one
proceeding
and
see
how
we
do,
then
if
we
miss
it
there,
i
mean
we're
talking
not
about
legal
errors
on
the
record.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
we're
taking
about
so-called
mistakes
because
we
want
the
death
penalty,
then
we'll
try
it
all
over
again
on
the
kidnapping,
then
we'll
try
it
all
over
again
say
on
an
armed
robbery
or
whatever
else
there
might
have
been,
no
it
can't
be
done
that
way
and
every
case
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
rely
on
the
fact
that
that
violates
our
constitutional
rights.
i
am
not
sure.
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
used,
i
believe
in
my
own
judgment,
conflicting
language
about
that,
because
they
have
said
that
they
will
go
by
what
name
is
attached
to
a
crime,
they
used
the
word
eo
nomine.
they
look
through
the
thing
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
do
here,
let's
look
through
this
kidnapping
and
see
what
it
really
does
amount
to.
the
whole
thing
amounts
to
another
prosecution
for
murder,
on
that
basis
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
that
is
want
i'm
saying
is
not
fair.
now,
if
under
our
procedure
as
was
done
in
the
hoag
versus
new
jersey,
we
could
have
in
one
indictment
set
forth
all
of
these
crimes
and
had
one
trial,
one
trail
free
from
error
which
is
of
course
another
consideration
that
this
court
has
used
more
than
once.
a
trial
free
from
error
that's
all
that
we've
said
here,
that
if
the
state,
all
we're
trying
to
do
is
get
the
state
a
trial
free
from
error.
and
the
--
the
court
said
in
hoag
versus
new
jersey
that
there
was
an
unexpected
turn
of
events.
we
cannot
say
and
i'm
quoting
the
court,
“we
cannot
say
that
after
such
an
expected
turn
of
events,
the
state's
decision
to
try
petitioner
for
yeager
--
for
the
yeager
robbery
was
so
arbitrary
or
lacking
in
justification
that
it
amounted
to
a
denial
of
those
concepts
constituting
the
very
essence
of
a
scheme
of
ordered
justice
which
is
due
process.
and
you
cite
brock
versus
north
carolina,
which
i
also
cite
and
quote
from
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
now,
if
it
please
the
court.
you
--
you
are
indicating
a
situation
where
the
--
there
was
no
kidnapping
prosecution
first
or
was
there
was
a
kidnapping
prosecution?
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
see.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
as
a
practical
matter
of
course
i'm
trying
to
look
at
things
as
a
practical
matter,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
sidestep
the
question,
but
i
--
i'm
quite
sure
of
this,
first
of
all
tulsa
county
would
have
never
allowed
muskogee
to
come
up
there
and
get
him,
but
had
they
allowed
them
to
do
that,
and
he
had
gone
to
muskogee
county,
and
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
--
had
pled
guilty
to
the
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
oh,
i
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
all
right.
in
that
case,
i
think
the
same
theory
would
have
to
apply,
namely
that
he
could
not
--
if
he
is
--
if
he
is
--
if
the
sentence
is
entered
in
muskogee
county
for
the
murder,
in
other
words
the
ultimate
crime
where
--
not
--
not
the
crime
of
lesser
magnitude,
but
the
ultimate
crime,
then
to
turn
around
and
even
charge
him
again,
regardless
of
the
time
that
the
charges
are
filed,
which
one
might
precede
the
other,
the
fact
that
muskogee
got
him
first,
sentenced
him
first,
would
be
conclusive
on
the
--
on
the
tulsa
court.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
used
the
language
of
merger
in
prince
versus
united
states,
construing
the
federal
statute
there
and
i
think
to
this
extent,
i
believe
i'm
sure
that
i
quote
prince
versus
new
york
in
there,
to
this
extent,
where
the
breaking
and
entering,
as
i
recall
the
bank,
and
then
the
robbery.
the
court
went
along
with
the
idea
that
the
intent
was
the
same
and
here
it
was
the
same,
the
reason
for
the
kidnapping
presumably,
and
the
reason
for
the
murder
was
to
escape
capture.
and
of
course,
attach
whatever
intent
you
must
to
it,
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
in
--
just
how
it
was.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
that
there
is
authority
for
saying
that
there
is
a
merger.
and
i
have
seen
the
use
of
the
word
merger
in
many
criminal
cases.
i
believe
also
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
applies
and
i
cite
that
in
my
brief.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
for
rebuttal,
i
don't
how
--
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
--
in
a
separate
class
from
all
of
the
counties
in
creating
the
offices.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
only
in
tulsa.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
--
i
saw
him
--
he
was
in
jail
in
tulsa.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
that's
the
(inaudible)
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
in
desperate
need
of
time,
but
to
sum
up
just
as
quickly
as
i
can
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
don't
intend
to
file
a
reply
brief
in
this
case,
at
least,
on
this
consideration,
i
may
later.
but
to
--
to
sum
up
my
rebuttal
to
the
state's
position
as
they
put
it
in
this
brief,
and
as
i
think
i
heard
it
here
today,
first
of
all,
there's
--
the
cases
that
they
cite,
morgan
versus
devine
and
certain
other
cases
involving
the
construction
of
congressional
acts,
i
don't
believe
have
one
moment's
applicability
to
our
situation
here.
in
rebuttal
to
morgan
versus
devine
and
one
or
two
of
the
other
cases
there,
i
cite
to
this
court
the
later
decisions
of
prince
versus
united
states
and
of
the
--
the
latest
advance
sheet,
my
namesake
ladner
versus
united
states
where
you
held
under
the
act
of
congress
that
one
shot
at
two
federal
officers
is
one
offense
rather
than
two
assaults.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
john
a.
ladner,
jr.
absolutely.
and
i
do
not
rely
on
those
cases
but
i
say
that
by
the
same
token,
neither
can
they.
i
am
interested
in
state
cases
here,
cases
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
--
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
made
the
same
mistake
throughout
their
entire
brief.
they
consider
that
i
am
here
under
the
fifth
amendment,
i
am
not.
when
i
mention
double
jeopardy,
i
am
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
mean
double
jeopardy
only
to
the
extent
that
that
doctrine
applies
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
double
punishment.
and
your
cases
that
i
have
cited,
many
of
them
here
bear
me
out
on
that
absolutely.
now,
let's
--
let's
understand
my
feeling
on
this.
if
we
want
to
go
into
how
heinous
a
crime
is,
if
we
want
to
say
how
despicable
a
man
is
and
deny
him
his
constitutional
rights
on
that
basis,
then
that's
new
law
indeed.
these
constitutional
guarantees
apply
to
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty,
and
this
man
admitted
his
guilt
to
the
kidnapping.
these
--
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
i
would
hesitate
to
be
any
part
of
a
speculation
or
a
conjecture
that
puts
the
switch
on
anybody
in
the
electric
chair,
and
i
don't
mean
by
that
to
depart
from
rationale
thinking
and
get
into
the
purely
emotional
anymore
than
perhaps
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
intended
to
do
that,
but
that's
just
exactly
what
he
did.
he
was
misled.
the
statement
by
the
county
attorney
that
there
are
plenty
of
cases
as
precedent
by
which
we
can
give
this
man
the
death
penalty
for
kidnapping
is
not
so
at
all.
if
clarence
darrow
would
have
been
in
tulsa
and
tried
to
figure
out
what
this
man
would
have
gotten
for
the
kidnapping,
he
would
have
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
we
did.
i
don't
care
how
experienced
the
trial
attorney.
what
do
you
do?
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
kidnapping
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
the
juries
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
and
barring
a
type
of
legal
or
judicial
entrapment,
which,
if
i
am
not
stepping
out
of
the
bounds
of
propriety,
is
exactly
what
happened
here,
through
the
co-work
of
the
prosecuting
attorney,
barring
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
rely
on
the
precedent
of
those
kidnapping
cases
taking
similar
fact
situations.
we
--
absolutely,
we
discussed
this
case
with
the
defendant.
he
wanted
to
get
it
off
his
chest.
now,
taking
that
into
consideration,
it
was
incredible
to
us
to
find
what
transpired
here
and
to
find
even
more,
let
us
say,
and
in
all
due
respect
to
our
courts
that
it
was
upheld
by
the
criminal
court
of
appeals.
we
don't
come
here
asking
mercy,
we
come
asking
justice.
and
for
that
matter,
i
just
--
i
just
feel
that
commendation
to
me
as
a
public
defender,
as
even
the
--
our
criminal
court
of
appeals
did
is
not
what
--
what
we're
--
what
i
want
here.
i
want
to
see,
now
that
we
are
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water,
that
we
can
step
into
it
because
ciucci,
i
believe
is
the
way
its
pronounced,
versus
illinois,
hoag
versus
new
jersey,
if
i
had
the
time
i'd
like
to
distinguish
those
two
cases
and
use
them
because
i
feel
that
hoag
can
be
very
definitely
distinguished
on
the
fact
that
the
first
three
robberies
wound
up
in
a
mistrial
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
so
this
court
says
that's
an
unexpected
turn
of
events.
that
doesn't
happen
in
our
case.
we
had
a
trial
or
at
least
a
plea
of
guilty
in
muskogee
free
from
any
error.
and
in
hoag
versus
new
jersey,
you
said
it
was
all
right
for
them
to
prosecute
the
man
again.
in
ciucci
versus
illinois,
without
getting
allophonic
question
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
of
all
three
or
four
murders,
that
prosecutor,
just
sure
as
this
world,
was
repeatedly
trying
to
do
the
very
same
thing
that
the
prosecutor
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
he
was
not
satisfied.
and
this
court
said
in
--
in
ciucci
versus
illinois
that
if
it
could
be
established
by
the
record
that
that
was
the
situation,
then
they
might
consider
the
case
otherwise,
and
i
think
that's
definitely
the
situation
in
--
in
this
case.
