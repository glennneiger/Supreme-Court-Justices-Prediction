mr.
mac
q.
williamson
mr.
chief
justice.
got
a
frog
in
my
throat,
excuse
me
please.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
that
is
what
(inaudible)
applies
here,
although
not
on
the
count
of
the
type
of
this
case
that
we're
privileged
to
come
back
here
again.
we
have
here
as
my
young
friend
from
tulsa
has
so
aptly
expressed
a
criminal
prosecution
in
the
courts
of
eastern
oklahoma
for
three
high
felonies,
where
they're
--
if
i
may
allude
to
it,
a
one
man
crime
wave
and
it
struck
me
that
it
might
be
highly
appropriate
that
in
order
that
the
court
obtain
and
retain
a
correct
perspective
of
what
happened,
that
i
would
try
to
be
of
help,
dividing
time
with
my
associate
and
assistant
in
oklahoma
city,
mr.
sam
lattimore.
and
so
with
the
permission
of
the
court
i
would
like
to
launch
into
the
events
that
happened
chronologically.
i
would
like
to
do
so
if
it
please
the
court
after
the
fashion
perhaps
of
a
newspaper
man
who
answers
questions,
how,
who,
what
and
when,
and
i
believe
once
the
rather
march
so
to
speak
has
been
established
in
the
minds
of
court
together,
with
the
happening
at
each
stop
on
the
route,
that
with
my
assistant
will
have
appropriate
law
to
cover
the
points
involved.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
your
honor,
may
i
say
this
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes,
sir.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
that's
really
the
take
off
point
on
my
route
of
march
that
i
was
about
to
launch
on.
i
was
about
to
say
to
this
court,
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
as
provided
by
two
special
legislative
acts,
the
office
and
position
of
a
public
defender
in
the
two
major
metropolitan
counties
of
the
state,
that
would
be
oklahoma
county
and
tulsa
county.
those
counties
have
rather
large
and
populous
cities
and
those
counties
have
public
defenders.
no
other
counties
have.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes
sir,
on
the
basis
of
population
and
valuation,
classification
setting
them
apart
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
now,
it's
my
understanding
and
i
think
the
record
will
bear
me
out,
that
this
man
who
is
dubbed
here,
edward
leon
williams,
but
who
like
many
men
both
of
good
and
bad
repute
has
a
nickname,
his
name
is
pete
williams,
i
think
that's
correct.
and
i
have
been
accustomed
in
the
few
days
i
have
looked
at
the
case
to
call
him
pete,
however
his
name
is
edward
leon
williams
and
i
would
like
with
permission
of
the
court
to
introduce
by
mapping
out
the
route
of
march
of
misconduct
of
this
edward
leon
williams,
so
that
this
court
may
know
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
trial
judges
of
tulsa
county
upon
two
criminal
charges
and
of
muskogee
county
upon
the
murder
charge.
now,
these
things
were
emblazoned
in
the
newspapers,
public
newspapers
of
the
state.
and
thus
this
crime
spree
began
in
the
wee
hours
of
a
saturday
morning
in
tulsa.
tulsa
city,
i
would
say
of
300,000
people,
am
i
right?
maybe
a
little
wrong,
oklahoma
city
is
about
400,000.
these
are
the
two
cities.
oklahoma
city
is
not
mentioned
or
mixed
up
in
this
route
of
march
that
i
am
going
to
delineate.
and
in
tulsa,
at
1
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
friday
the
16th
of
june,
this
young
man
comes
upon
the
scene.
i
say
young,
he
is
27
years
of
age
at
the
time
he
was
arraigned,
and
he
was
about
20,
between
25
and
26
at
the
time
he
showed
up
at
a
filling
station,
an
all
night
filling
station
in
tulsa
at
1
o'clock
in
the
morning.
at
south
park,
tulsa
he
showed
up
in
his
car,
a
pontiac
or
somebody's
car
he
was
driving
and
he
ordered
the
tank
filled
and
the
attendant
at
1
o'clock
in
the
morning
filled
the
tank
and
the
young
man
as
a
method
of
payment,
reached
in
the
seat
of
his
car
and
pulled
out
a
.38
pistol
and
told
the
young
man
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
he
wanted
--
he
had
got
the
gasoline,
that
he
wanted
the
money
and
he
took
$30
from
this
young
tenant
there
in
the
morning
and
drove
away.
and
then
he
somehow
or
other
somebody
must
have
known
something
because
the
law,
the
police,
the
city
police
of
tulsa
came
upon
him
perhaps
two
or
three
hours
later
and
there
ensued
an
automobile
chase
in
the
southeastern
part
of
tulsa,
this
was
after
daylight,
the
stick
up
was
1
o'clock
in
the
morning.
and
the
chase
was
on.
and
this
fellow
wrecked
his
pontiac
car
in
his
anxiety
and
in
his
speed
to
elude
the
local
police,
he
wrecked
it
and
here
is
the
thing
that
happened
at
the
wreck.
somehow
or
other
he
got
away
from
the
wreck
and
entered
a
concrete
culvert,
evidently
under
a
street
down
there
in
southeast
tulsa
and
made
his
escape
by
crawling
through
a
concrete
culvert
and
thus
upon
the
other
side
of
the
road
or
railroad
or
whatever
it
was
eluding
the
police.
and
he
stayed
ahead,
he
doesn't
come
upon
the
scene
then,
that
was
saturday.
he
comes
upon
the
scene
then
sunday
evening
in
tulsa,
at
5:30
in
the
evening.
when
he
is
standing
at
a
stoplight,
an
operating
stoplight
after
a
place,
a
corner
in
the
metropolitan
section
of
tulsa,
which
is
known
as
third
and
cheyenne
street,
a
stoplight
was
operating,
cars
were
passing
to
and
fro.
this
fellow
with
the
pistol
and
the
one
successful
hold
up
saw
a
car,
approached
and
stopped
--
the
stoplight.
he
went
out,
opened
the
door,
and
introduced
and
reinforced
by
his
.38
pistol,
he
took
a
seat
by
the
side
of
this
total
stranger
who
happened
to
be
a
young
ministerial
student.
and
if
i
maybe
pardoned
for
this
--
for
this
statement,
if
your
honors
please,
i
have
never
--
i
can't
imagine
two
men
of
more
singularly
different
strides
being
thrown
together
as
were
these
two
people
forcibly
when
this
man
had
introduced
himself,
entered
the
car,
and
the
car
sped
away.
and
the
hijacker,
the
same
fellow,
required
this
young
ministerial
student
to
drive
southeast
and
he
got
out
in
the
country
as
rapidly
as
possible
because
it's
obvious
that
he
is
wanted
for
at
least
one
hijacking
and
had
one
run
away
from
the
police.
and
so
he
required
this
young
man
to
drive
from
tulsa
in
a
southeasterly
direction.
this
whole
thing,
the
site
of
this
whole
thing
is
in
eastern
oklahoma,
tulsa
is
in
a
little
bit
northeastern,
muskogee
is
about
65
miles
southeast
of
tulsa,
still
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state.
they
drove
in
the
muskogee
direction.
and
by
the
time
that
they
got
about
seven
or
eight
miles
northwest
of
the
metropolis
or
the
local
metropolis
of
muskogee,
town
of
about
70,000
people.
why,
this
fellow
--
this
fellow
leon
pete
williams
was
in
country
which
he
knew.
and
so,
he
drove
there
to
this
wooded
area,
partially
settled
area
about
10
miles
northwest
of
muskogee
and
he
even
picked
out
a
dead
end
dirt
road
out
from
country.
he
drove
up
this
dead
end
road,
made
his
driver
get
out
of
the
car
and
the
driver
with
his
hands
up,
and
where
we
get
this
information
if
your
honors
please,
its
leon
pete
williams
telling.
the
driver,
the
man
he
was
about
to
kill
with
his
hands
up
to
his
head
stood
there
and
received
in
the
back
of
his
head,
behind
his
right
ear
one
bullet
that
passed
him
from
life
to
death.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
exactly.
now,
i
was
going
to
elaborate,
i
will
say
it
now,
that
this
information
which
i'm
trying
to
furnish
to
the
--
this
court
comes
from
the
county
attorney's
statement
who
got
his
information
from
pete
williams
who
admitted
in
this
record
that
everything
he
said
was
true.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well,
it
doesn't
appear,
of
course
the
court
will
understand
that
this
leon
williams,
i
shall
call
him
pete
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
that's
his
name,
one
of
them.
and
pete
williams
as
you
understand
was
in
jail,
i
assume
he
is
in
jail,
wherein
i
didn't
see
him,
wasn't
he
mr.--
wasn't
pete
williams
in
jail?
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
he
was
--
yes.
your
client.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes.
so,
well
i'm
sure
of
course
he
was
there
on
two
or
three
different
occasions.
excuse
me
--
on
two
or
three
different
occasion.
i
mean
by
that
in
the
course
of
the
weeks
that's
passed.
now,
he
was
taken
of
course
to
muskogee
first
and
i
want
to
arrive
at
that
as
we
go
on
our
route
march
here
in
a
minute.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well,
it
appears
out
of
--
not
within
a
great
particularity.
but
it
was
admitted,
williams'
admission
appears
in
the
record
here
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
--
where
he
knows,
he
heard
the
whole
thing
read,
the
statement
of
the
county
attorney
and
that
he
i
think
merely
said
he
furnished
part
of
it.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well,
actually
your
honor
the
court
i
think
will
understand
there
in
pursuance
of
my
duties
to
oklahoma
city
i
was
never
around
the
district
court
of
tulsa
or
the
jail
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
feel
sure
that
--
that
mr.
leon
williams'
admission
in
this
record
that
he
knew
and
had
heard
the
county
attorney's
statement
and
that
the
things
the
county
attorney
said
therein
were
true.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
that's
on
page
28
and
29.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
oh,
yes.
if
your
honor
please,
the
record
is
replete
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
--
with
that.
i
mean,
there's
just
be
--
not
the
slightest
question.
as
--
but
what
he
had,
the
advise
of
the
public
defenders.
and
so
those
pleas
were
entered
on
the
two
tulsa
county
charges
on
or
about
the
30th,
am
i
right
on
that,
30th
of
january,
1957?
is
that
correct?
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
thank
you.
(inaudible)
studies
this
case
a
great
deal
longer
than
i
have
but
i'll
kind
of
stay
in
the
record.
all
right,
on
the
30th
of
january
these
--
this
man
entered
pleas
of
guilty
to
kidnapping
and
to
robbery
with
firearms,
both
of
them
capital
offenses.
the
man
and
this
round
that
we
have
gone
on,
occupying
some
48,
some
60
hours
to
72
hours,
he
had
committed
three
capital
crimes,
murder,
kidnapping,
robbery
with
firearm.
and
having
pled
guilty
to
the
last
two,
the
authorities
at
tulsa
began
to
move
in
on
him
and
he
was
given
a
time
for
sentencing,
i
don't
recall.
the
court
was
very
liberal
and
very
thoughtful
about
it
and
gave
him
several
days.
and
in
the
mean
time,
the
statement
which
is
really
one
of
bones
of
contention
in
this
lawsuit
and
which
is
--
appears
in
full
in
the
record,
beginning
at
page
10
as
i
have
it
and
going
perhaps
page
19
--
18.
now
that
is
the
controversy
of
the
statement
and
the
court
would
bear
in
mind
that
with
the
murder
--
with
the
murder
penalty
already
assessed,
interwoven
as
it
was
with
and
as
a
climax
to
the
kidnapping
that
here
comes
this
subject
of
kidnapping
on.
and
the
county
attorney
after
the
plea
of
guilty
was
permitted
by
the
district
judge
to
read
a
rather
lengthy
statement
that
the
county
attorney
had
typed
and
which
the
man
williams
agreed
to
tell
the
truth.
and
so
this
statement
here
by
the
county
attorney
is
very
truthful.
i
mean,
it
goes
into
the
many
records
of
the
happenings
of
the
moment,
current
happenings
and
it
also,
if
your
honors
please,
takes
up
what
we
lawyers
call
and
officers
of
the
law
call,
the
rap
sheet
of
an
individual
of
poor
reputation.
he
has
a
rap
sheet
and
the
rap
sheet
is
the
record
of
his
convictions
about
over
the
country
in
the
various
courts
and
the
organizations
in
washington,
the
fbi,
are
very
good
bookkeepers
on
keeping
these
rap
sheets
current.
and
so,
with
permission
of
the
court,
i
want
to
show
what
the
evidence
shows
that
constitutes
the
record
of
this
young
man
in
which
the
young
man
himself
verifies
that
this
is
the
truth.
mr.
edmondson
by
the
way,
i
believe
the
court
understands
that
since
january
12th,
he's
incidentally
been
the
new
governor
of
oklahoma.
he
was
the
county
attorney
at
this
trial.
mr.
edmondson
according
to
the
record
of
the
fbi
in
washington
the
defendant
started
his
first
criminal
act
for
which
there
is
a
record
on
october
16
1944.
and
this
was
1956,
he
had
12
years
experience
at
that
time,
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
october
16,
1944
long
beach,
california,
where
he
is
arrested
for
grand
theft,
automobile
and
burglary
and
released
to
juvenile
bureau.
january
22,
1945,
williams
was
arrested
in
tulsa
for
automobile
theft.
and
on
august
1,
1945,
was
released
the
united
state
marshal
for
prosecution
of
violations
of
the
dyer
act.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
--
i'm
quite
clear
that
it
bears,
it's
what
the
trial
court,
the
sentencing
court
knew,
he
took
this
into
consideration
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
--
and
it
goes
to
show
that
this
young
man
was
in
this
business
practically
all
his
life.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
correct.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
it
is
significant
only
that
it
adds
as
much
fuel
to
flames
that
already
burning
to
show
that
the
man
was
wicked,
malevolent,
knave.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
and
the
court
had
that
in
mind
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
--
when
he
gave
him
the
death
penalty
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
--
among
other
things.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes.
well,
that
and
that
only
is
the
reason,
there
are
several
other
items
on
the
rap
sheets
and
i'm
purposely
willing
to
waive
them
because
it's
rather
evident
that
he
was
not
a
good
citizen.
that's
an
understatement.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
we
might
pay
some
little
attention
to
the
edmondson
statement
by
hitting
two
or
three
of
the
high
points.
the
record,
page
11
--
page
11,
i
shall
not
read
but
10,11,12,
and
13
go
into
specific
detail,
all
admitted
by
this
petitioner
as
being
true
to
the
effect
that
he
has
participated
in
the
activities
i
have
gone
over.
now
--
actually,
judge
webb,
judge
webb
was
the
district
--
trial
district
judge
at
tulsa
who
accepted
the
two
pleas
of
guilty
on
kidnapping
and
the
hijacking
case.
judge
webb
was
very
technically
careful
and
the
record
will
show
and
there
will
be
no
contest
on
that.
to
make
it
clear
that
he
wanted
this
--
this
defendant
to
be
assured
of
his
extra
time
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
think
this
over
before
he
entered
the
plea.
and
the
judge
of
his
own
volition
after
the
plea
was
entered
with
full
warning
and
knowledge
of
his
rights,
the
judge
granted
him
an
additional
two
days
extra
before
he
imposed
the
sentence.
and
then
went
ahead
and
with
the
receipt
of
the
seven
or
eight
page
statement
from
the
county
attorney
proceeded
to
pronounce
sentence
of
death
for
the
kidnapping
which
of
course
began
on
the
streets
of
tulsa
and
wound
up
in
the
lonely
field
area
about
--
via
muskogee.
he
was
just
given
death
for
that.
the
county
attorney
made
this
long
statement
and
actually
mr.
woodson
who
was
the
other
public
defender
along
with
mr.
ladner
was
--
was
active
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court.
and
mr.
woodson
objected
to
some
of
the
statements
of
the
county
attorney.
and
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
they
were
going
into
angles
that
--
all
mr.
woodson
said
had
already
been
covered
by
the
filing
of
a
charge
of
murder
and
the
sentencing
of
the
man
to
life
imprisonment.
anyhow
these
--
these
case
were
--
were
interwoven.
the
tulsa
kidnapping
case
was
completely
interwoven
with
the
murder
case
at
muskogee,
in
that
the
murder
case
was
the
final
act,
the
end
of
the
road
of
kidnapping.
now,
it's
our
contention
that
both
judge
webb
who
was
the
district
court
judge
at
tulsa
and
judge
carroll
our
very
experienced
judges
and
that
they
like
all
other
state
district
judges
in
oklahoma,
had
a
right
which
has
become
a
tradition
in
oklahoma
for
judges
who
are
called
upon
to
sentence
men
who
have
pled
guilty.
our
judges
traditionally
understand
and
our
people
understand
that
a
judge
had
the
right
to
call
upon
the
prosecutors
or
the
sheriff
or
anybody
else
that
who
is
an
officer
of
the
court
there
who
might
know
something
about
this
man
or
this
party
whose
plea
of
guilty
has
just
been
received.
it's
standard
operating
procedure
in
oklahoma
for
judges
to
want
to
know
something
about
the
nature
and
character
and
the
type
of
person
who
had
just
pled
guilty
to
a
violation
of
the
law.
and
so,
mr.
woodson
made
no
outcry
at
all.
he
--
he
was
representing
leon
williams
when
this
seven
or
eight
page
statement
of
the
county
attorney
was
read.
he
did
object
to
some
of
the
questions.
he
finally
agreed
that
some
of
them
were
--
that
he
thought
were
all
right
or
he
agreed
at
least
to
proceed,
i
have
them
marked
here
where
mr.
woodson
on
one
occasion
said
--
it's
on
page
11
of
the
record,
counsel
for
edwards
said,
all
right
to
the
court
who
was
hearing
the
county
attorney's
statement.
he
--
they
didn't
oppose
this
thing
with
a
vigor
that
lasted
all
through
the
hearing
and
culminated
with
a
motion,
at
the
conclusion
of
this
hearing
which
he
had
a
right
to
make,
if
he'd
wanted
to
make
it,
a
motion
to
strike
the
county
attorney's
statement
from
the
record.
now,
in
the
--
he
understand
the
custom
there
that
judges
are
supposed
to
have
enough
balance
to
take
statements
from
the
county
attorneys
of
our
state
and
then
to
use
them
appropriately
in
pronouncing
a
sensible
and
logical,
and
just
sentence
on
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well,
as
i
--
as
i
understand
the
argument
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
i
--
i
agree
entirely,
that
is
the
basic
argument
and
of
course
actually
one
has
to
be
--
as
i
see
that
argument
it's
not
supported
by
the
record.
it
is
supported
by
the
record
to
a
certain
extent
and
that
is
that
there
was
some
considerable
information
given
the
judge
at
tulsa
about
the
murder
case
over
at
muskogee,
not
a
great
deal,
but
they
were
some
in
them.
but
the
fact
that
here
the
state
comes
up
with
malevolent
purpose
and
design
and
says
we're
going
after
him
again.
we
didn't
get
enough
that
time.
there's
none
of
that
in
the
record.
that
all
arises
in
the
imagination
of
some
of
the
folks
who
are
highly
interested
in
this
case
and
i
guess
i
would
have
a
sort
of
imagination
too
if
i
were
interested
on
the
other
side.
but
--
but
so
far
as
being
any
evidence
to
support
this
malevolent
or
stealthy
or
vicious
purpose
of
the
state
to
go
out
and
seek
further
and
more
and
heavier
impositions
on
this
fellow,
i
don't
know
where
the
line,
is
that
anywhere
in
the
record.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
pardon?
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well,
you
would
have
a
different
case
if
the
judge
spoke
of
to
that
effect
or
even
if
he
handed
it
privately
to
that
effect.
but
still,
if
your
honor
please,
that
isn't
in
the
record.
i
mean,
in
order
to
get
this
situation
in
to
the
slaughter,
the
channel
of
a
malevolent
purpose
of
state
officials
to
help
take
this
man's
life
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
--
you've
got
to
imagine
something.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes,
i
quite
agree.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
and
the
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes,
we
do,
that's
true,
that's
the
fact.
now,
we
also
have
decisions
of
the
court
there
that
persons
can
be
--
can
be
tried
and
convicted
for
one
of
the
segments
of
an
entire
all
encompassing
crime,
just
for
the
same
reason
that
we
have
a
federal
law
which
prohibits
people
from
taking
mail
bags.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well
--
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
no.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
no,
no,
not
at
all.
he
could've
been
tried
once
for
that
offence
and
that
offence
was
perhaps
one
of
the
essential
elements
that
finally
led
to
murder.
had
there
been
no
kidnapping,
there'd
been
no
murder.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
sir,
that's
our
construction,
if
your
honor
please,
and
it's
that
(inaudible)
because
we
--
our
criminal
court
of
appeals
studied
this
matter
very
carefully.
it
upheld
the
--
the
laws
of
our
state
which
provide
and
permit
that
sort
of
prosecution
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
that's
right.
yes,
i
think
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes,
sir,
they
were.
and
the
--
the
date
was
changed.
it
was
--
was
put
forward
from
january
30,
1957
to
february
1st,
there
are
two
days
as
an
intervention
there.
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
yes.
that's
correct.
and
he
had
given
him
that
time
to
study
it
over.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
lost
track
of
my
time,
i
wonder
if
i
can
be
advised
by
somebody.
have
we
used
45?
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
of
the
hour?
mr.
mac
q.
williamson
well,
i
desire
to
waive
in
favor
of
mr.
lattimore.
