already
been
punished?

black
given

life
sentence.
justice

that
your
point
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
having
been
sentenced
to
life
for
the
crime.
then,
one
county
he
could
not
be
violating
due
process
to
trial
and
sentence
him
to
death.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
39?
there's
a
syllabus
count
in
your
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
are
you
referring
to?
what
affidavits?
where
is
it
printed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
this
affidavit
used
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
statement
used
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
muskogee
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
complaints
do
you
think
its
--
just
isn't
--
not
customary
for
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
make
statements
from
the
judge
in
the
time
of
sentencing
and
for
the
defendant's
attorney
could
make
a
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
the
--
what
you
have
here,
(inaudible)
a
murder
was
committed
in
muskogee
county.
the
victim
was
cooke.
justice
hugo
l.
black
cooke
had
been
kidnapped
in
tulsa
county.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
--
in
the
kidnapping,
he
was
killed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
pled
guilty
to
murderer
and
was
given
life
in
muskogee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
charged
that
--
they
had
a
right
to
charge
him,
did
they
not,
for
kidnapping
and
robbery.
these
were
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
tulsa?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
court
has
passed
on
this
question
similarly
before
in
hoag
versus
new
jersey
which
i
will
get
to
here
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
compliant
is,
isn't
it
that
after
he
pleaded
guilty
and
the
court
then
considering
it,
took
into
consideration
not
merely
the
kidnapping
but
the
murder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
also
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
he
had
been
embarked
as
he
set
up
on
a
career
of
crime
since
he
was
a
very
young
man,
series
of
hijacking,
robbery,
was
found,
resulting
and
ending
up
in
murder
and
kidnapping.
i
suppose
he
had
not
considered
the
murder,
would
you
say
that
was
--
without
that
the
province
of
the
court
had
violated
due
process
for
them
to
consider
the
prior
crimes
that
had
been
committed
in
fixing
the
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
application
do
you
--
what
consideration
should
this
be
given
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
by
that,
i
suppose
that
muskogee
could've
tried
him
for
kidnapping,
because
he
was
there
--
kidnapped
in
that
part
of
the
time
and
then
the
other
county
could
have
tried
--
tulsa
could
have
tried
him
for
kidnapping
because
part
of
it
took
place
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
he
could
have
been
tried
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
twice
for
kidnapping?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
is,
he
was
tried
for
murder
in
one
county
and
given
life.
tried
for
kidnapping
in
the
other
one,
they
had
a
right
to
give
him
death
and
they
took
into
consideration
the
kind
of
life
he'd
led
including
the
murder
he
committed,
that's
your
concerns,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
thing,
as
i
understand
the
record,
he
was
brought
in
on
the
basis
he
pleaded
guilty.
at
that
time,
30th
of
january,
at
that
time
the
prosecuting
attorney
wanted
to
make
a
statement
and
did,
stated
all
these
facts,
brought
back
on
february
the
1st,
the
judge
asked
him
if
he
heard
all
that
and
understood
it
all,
and
if
he
had
any
corrections
to
make.
he
did
make
one
or
two
corrections,
didn't
he?
and
he
asked
him
if
the
rest
were
true,
and
he
said
it
was.
was
it
--
is
that
--
am
i
right
about
those
two
dates
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
counsel
there
at
both
times?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that
the
judge,
as
i
recall
it,
asked
him
if
he
had
time
and
considered
it.
