chief
justice
earl
warren
number
124,
edward
leon
williams,
petitioner,
versus
the
state
of
oklahoma.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
indeed,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ladner
may
be
so
admitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ladner,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
justice
harlan's
question
was
what
did
the
judge
in
this
muskogee
county
give
--
say
as
a
reason
for
his
--
for
giving
a
life
sentence
instead
of
a
death
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
what
difference
does
it
make
if
he
was
handcuffed
before
a
jury,
if
the
jury
didn't
act
and
he
pled
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
all
right.
go
right
ahead
and
finish
the
plea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
statement
of
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
statement
of
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ciucci,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ladner
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
going
to
ask
you
this
mr.
ladner,
suppose
this
man
had
been
charged
in
muskogee
with
--
muskogee
with
murder,
kidnapping
and
robbery,
could
he
have
been
convicted
and
sentenced
on
all
three?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
assume
that
the
kidnapping
had
occurred
in
muskogee
county.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
they
could
or
they
could
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
that
under
state
law
or
is
that
under
--
does
that
violate
the
constitutional
rights,
which
do
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
suppose
in
tulsa
county,
the
man
had
been
charged
first
with
kidnapping
and
then
later
he
went
down
to
muskogee
and
got
himself
indicted
and
very
promptly
pled
guilty
and
--
and
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
would
that
under
your
state
law
have
divested
the
court
in
--
in
the
tulsa
county
from
trying
him
for
the
--
for
the
kidnapping?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
kidnapping
prosecution
was
started
first
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
tulsa.
and
thereafter
he
was
--
he
was
charged
with
murder
down
in
muskogee
county
and
he
stepped
right
up
and
pled
guilty
and
got
life
imprisonment
there.
would
the
--
would
the
court
be
divested
to
jurisdiction
in
tulsa
on
that
kidnapping
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
might
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
might
have
caught
him
in
--
in
muskogee
county.
he
might
have
been
indicted
for
kidnapping
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
tulsa.
he
might
have
been
caught
in
muskogee,
so
you
won't
have
that
--
you
won't
have
to
worry
about
getting
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
any
authority
for
the
fact
that
kidnapping
is
the
kind
of
crime
that
merges
in
murder
if
the
murder
is
committed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
attorney
general
williamson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
many
of
us
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
just
as
a
matter
of
general
information
may
i
ask
you
do
have
a
county
defender's
--
public
defender's
office
in
oklahoma
or
is
public
defender
a
name
that
you
give
to
lawyer's
society?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
assume
that
because
we
have
public
defender
system
in
our
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
very
few
states
that
do
and
i
--
i
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
is
that
--
is
that
jurisdiction
just
county
wide?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i'll
tell
you
what
raises
my
curiosity,
i
--
i
noticed
that
mr.
williams
or
mr.
ladner
in
it
--
is
(inaudible)
as
being
from
tulsa,
oklahoma
and
i
understood
from
him
that
he
represented
the
defendant
as
--
at
muskogee,
is
that
right?
or,
you
were
not
there
at
that
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
only
the
second
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
--
i
misunderstood
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
is
this
--
do
this
go
to
this
--
in
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
--
of
the
sentence
of
death
or
does
this
bear
on
some
legal
problem
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you're
willing
to
discuss
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
that's
not
the
question
hardly
that
even
it's
in
there,
it's
the
legal
question
that
we
were
interested
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
if
it
wasn't
for
these
legal
problems
that
are
raised
by
--
by
mr.
ladner,
that
there
would
be
no
question
about
whether
this
was
adequate
punishment
for
a
crime
of
kidnapping,
robbery,
and
murder
so
we're
--
unless
it
has
some
legal
significance
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
think
that
we
might
go
and
get
into
some
of
the
legal
problems
involved
here
because
that's
what
we
must
decide.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
i
think
even
mr.
ladner
would
--
would
concede
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
legal
problems
there
are
involved
in
here
that
the
ones
he
had
raised,
that
the
crime
was
one
that
was
punishable
by
death
under
the
oklahoma
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
15
minutes
left.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lattimore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
with
robbery?
chief
justice
earl
warren
include
robbery?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
lattimore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
deny
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
he
deny
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
he
deny
or
contest
any
of
these
statements
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lattimore,
you
may
take
one
minute
or
so
to
sum
up,
but
your
time
is
up
and
we
must
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
conclude
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ladner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ladner
while
i'm
sure
you
didn't
--
hadn't
given
your
services
to
this
man
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
commendation,
the
court
does
appreciate
what
you
have
done.
we
realize
you
have
left
the
public
defender's
office
and
are
giving
your
own
--
your
own
time
as
a
lawyer
in
the
interest
of
what
you
consider
to
be
the
cause
of
justice
and
for
that,
we
--
we
do
commend
you.
and
it
just
--
does
give
us
comfort
to
know
that
lawyers
will
--
will
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
of
course,
gentlemen,
we
appreciate
the
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
interest
of
your
state.
