what
justice
stewart
is
suggesting
is
--
isn't
that
oklahoma
law
for
our
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they're
very
different
things
mr.
ladner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
--
between
a
construction
of
a
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
truth
that
was
offered
in
yick
wo
that
although
on
the
face
of
it,
it
was
a
fair
statute
in
the
sense
that
it
didn't
discriminate
against
chinese
laundrymen.
that's
an
old
recollection
of
service.
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
what
this
court
said
in
yick
wo
is
that
no
matter
how
fairly
it's
written,
it's
(inaudible)
often
that
in
fact
this
statute
was
only
construed
against
chinese
laundrymen
and
no
other
laundrymen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
a
disregard
of
the
construction
of
the
statute.
that's
proving
a
federal
claim
that
although
the
statute
on
the
face
is
all
right,
in
enforcement
it's
all
wrong,
those
are
very
different
things.
this
court
in
yick
wo
didn't
say
we
did
agree
with
california
court
as
to
what
it
meant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
disagreed
with
the
california
court
in
saying
that
despite
this
demonstration
in
fact
you
can
just
look
at
the
statute
and
be
bind
what
happens
under
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
particular
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
is
the
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
must
find
the
variation
between
this
particular
case
and
the
norm
of
a
conventional
application
of
that
statute
in
other
cases
in
oklahoma.
because
when
you
say
you
don't
ask
this
court
to
construe
the
statute
as
unconstitutional,
you
must
find
an
element
of
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
adding
that
in
the
williams
case
we
said
that
you
may
sentence
on
ex
parte
undisclosed
information
as
under
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
relatively,
probation,
the
whole
probation
system
all
these
experts
advices
is
relative
reason
thing
though
it
began
in
massachusetts
as
i
recall
over
a
100
odd
years
ago,
why
a
shoemaker
was
interested
in
this
problem.
but
do
you
think
in
--
before
we
had
the
--
this
probation
system,
courts
would
get
their
information
from
the
prosecutor.
and
you
are
suggesting
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
the
due
process
clause,
it
makes
a
difference
that
the
information
comes
through
the
judge
from
this
system
of
probation
that
they
should
rather
than
from
a
prosecutor.
that's
true,
isn't
it,
that
you
learn
a
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
objected
to
it
if
it
had
been
--
if
they'd
put
--
been
put
before
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
very
different
thing,
isn't
it?
because
those
are
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
ciucci
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
the
question
of
construction
not
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
constitutionality.
