justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ladner
aren't
you
--
or
are
you
or
aren't
you
faced
with
the
difficulty
that
your
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
this
was
a
compliance
with
title
2,
section
973
of
your
statutes
because
of
the
waiver
of
the
provisions
of
section
974
and
if
that
is
a
matter
of
the
law
of
oklahoma
as
to
how
these
matters
can
get
before
the
sentencing
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
that
a
matter
of
state
law?
i
mean,
how
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
the
oklahoma
court
in
your
opinion
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
oklahoma
lawyers'
opinion
is
wrong
in
its
construction
of
statute,
isn't
that
still
binding
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
you
are
saying
then
are
--
are
you,
is
that
if
this
is
what
this
statute
means,
if
what
the
oklahoma
court
has
said
this
statute
means,
if
that's
the
law
of
oklahoma
then
you
are
telling
us
that
that's
unconstitutional.
that
that
--
that
that
law,
that
state
law
violates
the
federal
constitution,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
so
construed,
i
mean,
isn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
different.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
your
court
does
have
power
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
referred
otherwise
from
paragraph
seven
of
the
syllabus,
but
i
was
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
is
not.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
you're
suggesting
that
laying
aside
all
of
the
ex
parte
statement
of
the
prosecutor,
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
given
murder
or
rather
given
death
by
the
judge,
who
basically
i
suppose
you
would
concede,
could
take
traditional
notice
of
the
fact
that
this
fellow
had
been
indicted
for
murder
and
had
been
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
the
mere
fact
that
he
took
that
into
account
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
there
were
nothing
in
this
record,
except
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
judge
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
had
committed
a
murder,
had
pleaded
guilty
to
it,
and
had
been
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
and
nevertheless
had
given
the
death
penalty
as
he
did,
would
you
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
so,
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
your
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
general
williamson,
you
said
something
that
isn't
quite
clear
to
me,
you
say
where
we
get
this
information
is
from
the
petitioner
himself.
well
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
it's
contained
in
the
statement
of
the
prosecuting
attorney,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
and
how
and
where
did
he
get
the
information
from
petitioner,
is
that
appear?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he's
under
a
life
sentence
at
the
time
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i'm
still
interest
in
making
this
route
march
as
to
how
and
where
this
information
was
imported
by
williams
to
the
county
prosecuting
attorney,
does
that
appear
in
any?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
in
mind
the
--
i
have
in
mind
general
williamson
that
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
that
it
--
when
they
were
getting
ready
for
the
first
jury
trial
in
muskogee,
which
ended
in
the
withdrawal
of
the
not
guilty
plea
and
a
plea
of
guilty
and
a
life
sentence,
that
the
trial
court
there
said
that
there
were
two
confessions,
one
of
which
had
been
--
had
been
lost
or
disappeared.
and
that
therefore
even
the
trial
court
had
no
idea
of
what
was
contained
in
it.
and
that
with
respect
to
the
other
confession
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
had
been
coerced.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
only
indication
in
the
record
that
i
can
see
that
williams
imparted
this
information
in
any
way.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand,
i
can
--
you
know
the
record
better
than
i
do
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
point
something.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
sir.
and
it's
again
found
mr.--
if
your
honor
please,
on
page
--
just
a
restatement,
i
believe
it's
on
page
77,
75
to
77.
i
mean
it's
perhaps
a
little
bit
more
in
detail
there.
well,
may
i
go
there
and
ahead,
i'll
try
to
reach
that
in
further
detail
as
we
go
on.
now,
this
--
this
man
leon
williams
when
he
took
the
young
baptist
minister
and
drove
him
to
a
secluded
spot
or
had
him
to
drive
to
this
spot
some
eight
or
10
miles
from
the
city
of
muskogee
and
took
him
out
and
shot
him
down,
we
got
that
information
from
this
man.
he
was
later
apprehended.
however,
after
he
had
performed
some
more
of
his
acts
in
disregard
of
law,
he
--
he
drove
from
this
point
of
death
there
in
the
baptist
minister's
old
mobile
convertible.
he
drove
up
farther,
i
believe
it
was
talihina,
a
little
indian
town
there,
that's
on
beyond
muskogee,
on
a
general
direction
toward
the
arkansas
line.
he
seemed
to
know,
very
acquainted
around
talihina,
he
got
there,
i
don't
know
just
what
hour
in
the
day
time,
but
he
took
this
trusty
pistol
and
pulled
another,
hijacked
him
in
the
little
town
of
talihina,
when
he
held
up
a
fellow
that
he
had
worked
for
as
i
understand
it
and
charged
$1000
for
dropping
in
on
him
with
a
pistol.
then
he
--
i
believe
the
officers
got
after
him
around
--
i
think
the
record
will
show
that,
that
they
got
after
him,
that
he
abandoned
this
car
of
the
young
preacher's
and
took
to
the
woods,
that's
a
heavily
wooded
section,
southeast
oklahoma.
and
that
he
finally
came
out
of
the
woods
on
foot
and
worked
his
way
into
the
town
of
wilburton,
oklahoma,
which
is
a
county
seat
in
a
rural
county
just
maybe
40
miles
from
the
arkansas
line.
he
paid
somebody
$30
to
take
him
from
the
brush
where
he'd
been
hiding
to
wilburton.
at
wilburton
he
boarded
a
bus,
a
commercial
bus
for
--
bound
for
fort
smith,
arkansas.
and
actually
the
officers
were
not
far
behind.
it
was
on
that
bus,
on
his
way
eastward
out
of
oklahoma
toward
arkansas,
that
he
was
placed
under
arrest
by
state
highwaymen.
state
highway
patrolmen
arrested
him
and
it
wasn't
--
but
a
very
short
time
until
he
voluntarily
agreed
to
go
back
with
the
officers
to
the
muskogee
country.
he
stopped
on
the
way
and
showed
them
where
he
had
hid
his
.38
pistol
and
of
course
the
.38
pistol
was
found
in
the
body
of
this
young
minister,
tommy
cooke,
was
found,
and
the
statements
was
made
by
this
young
man.
he
--
he
of
course
was
lodged
in
the
muskogee
county
jail
as
i
understand
it.
the
record
apparently
shows
that
and
he
was
charged
with
murder.
and
it's
--
the
record
would
show
that
he
pled
not
guilty
first
and
that
he
stood
for
trial
that
i
believe
the
jury
was
impaneled
and
sworn
and
at
the
trial
of
leon
williams
here
on
a
charge
of
murder
proceeded.
and
during
this
trial
that
something
happened,
where
he
decided
to
change
his
plea
perhaps
as
it
might
be
said
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
he
changed
his
plea
from
not
guilty
to
guilty.
and
of
course
the
judge
as
understood
it,
the
judge,
the
jury
and
--
and
probably
with
a
wait
of
two
days
accepted
his
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charge
of
murder.
and
the
district
judge
there,
judge
e.
j.
carroll
upon
the
arrival
of
the
day
for
sentencing
did
sentence
leon
williams
in
the
district
court
at
muskogee,
that
is
the
first
time
now
that
he
had
been
charged
and
stood
trial
on
this
(inaudible).
he
was
given
by
judge
carroll
a
sentence
of
life
in
a
state
penitentiary.
and
then
he
was
sent
to
mcalester
in
accordance
with
that
sentence
and
then
stalled
in
the
penitentiary,
and
authorities
of
tulsa
county
did
not
know
the
machinery
by
which
they
got
control
of
this
prisoner,
but
i
know
they
did,
i
don't
know
that
but
i
don't
know
what
--
from
a
mr.--
my
friend
here
mr.
ladner
would
know
all
about
that.
anyhow,
the
man
was
turned
over
to
tulsa
county
and
it
was
then
that
the
young
county
attorney
of
tulsa
county
began
to
get
acquainted
with
this
fellow
leon
williams.
the
attorney
there,
the
county
attorney
filed
two
charges
against
him
as
a
result
of
this
48
hours
trips
that
we
just
took
with
him
awhile
ago,
which
started
out
with
hijacking
in
the
filling
station
and
then
would
later
on
kidnapping
the
young
baptist
preacher
and
taking
him
out
of
the
county
and
killing
him.
well,
the
county
attorney
filed
the
charges
against
this
man,
williams,
after
they
recovered
the
--
had
gotten
hold
of
him
in
the
county
jail
at
tulsa.
the
county
attorney
filed
a
hijacking
or
robbery
charge
against
him.
that
is
where
he
has
robbed
the
all
night
station,
took
$30
of
the
young
fellow
and
threatened
to
blow
his
head
off
so
he
didn't
stay
in
the
--
this
filling
station
until
he
got
away.
any
how
the
other
charge
was
the
kidnapping
charge.
now
bear
in
mind,
if
your
honors
please,
in
the
mean
time
when
this
kidnapping
charge
was
filed
the
murder
charge
had
already
been
filed
at
muskogee
and
he
had
been
given
life
for
that.
but
nevertheless
county
attorney
still
--
had
filed
a
kidnapping
and
they
went
ahead
and
williams
thought
it
over
i
presume
maybe
talked
to
his
lawyers,
there
are
two
public
defenders
i
believe
that's
right
maybe
in
tulsa
county.
and
mr.
fred
woods
is
one
and
the
gentleman
far
here
is
the
other
one.
anyhow,
that
for
some
reason
which
was
sufficient
and
to
himself,
as
leon
williams
entered
pleas
of
guilty
both
to
the
$30
midnight
filling
station
hijacking
and
to
the
kidnapping
charge
of
taking
the
young
baptist
minister.
he
had
before
entering
those
pleas
had
--
had
an
opportunity
to
confer
and
had
conferred
with
the
public
defenders
office?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
general
williamson,
whatever
may
have
been
done
in
the
trial
court,
as
i
understand
the
basic
argument
here
by
mr.
ladner,
it's
not
that
it
was
improper
or
inappropriate
for
the
sentencing
judge
to
consider
petitioner's
prior
record
or
to
consider
the
background
and
surrounding
circumstances
of
the
offense
for
which
he
was
being
sentenced,
the
kidnapping
or
the
fact
that
it
was
done
and
--
or
what
happened
at
the
conclusion
of
the
kidnapping.
the
basic
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
where
the
depravation
of
a
constitutional
right
lies
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
not
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
only
life
imprisonment
for
murder
the
first
time,
in
fact
and
in
effect
went
after
him
a
second
time,
with
vengeance
determined
upon
seeing
to
it
that
he
be
sentenced
to
death,
that's
the
basic
argument
that
he
makes
in
his
brief,
not
that
--
that
it
was
improper
for
the
sentencing
judge
to
consider
surrounding
circumstances,
because
obviously
it's
not.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
what
you
have
to
say
to
--
in
answer
to
that
basic,
more
basic
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--it
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
malevolence
is
necessary,
if
you
do
have
a
clear
case
of
double
jeopardy,
there
can
be
double
jeopardy
without
any
malevolence
at
all
of
course,
can't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
so
malevolence
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
essential
to
a
constitutional
depravation.
you
--
you
do
have
in
--
also
in
your
state
constitution
a
guarantee
against
double
jeopardy,
don't
you?
