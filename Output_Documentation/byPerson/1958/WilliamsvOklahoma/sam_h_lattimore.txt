mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
if
the
court
please.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
may
i
first
just
to
express
commendation
of
mr.
ladner
as
a
public
prosecutor
--
a
public
defender
in
oklahoma.
he
had
absolutely
no
duty
to
perform
after
the
trial
in
the
trial
court.
and
yet
he
and
mr.
woodson
brought
the
matter
to
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
and
then
he
brought
on
up
here.
it
certainly
is
a
shining
proof
of
the
fact
that
in
oklahoma
at
least,
our
public
defenders
are
uninfluenced
by
the
fact
that
they
are
employed
and
paid
by
the
state
and
that
they
don't
have
any
official
duty
after
the
trial
in
the
trial
court.
we
are
proud
of
our
public
defender
type.
may
i
first
answer
a
question
that's
been
asked
with
reference
to
the
venue
in
this
case
on
what
could
have
been
done
in
muskogee
county
and
tulsa
county?
this
defendant
could
have
been
prosecuted
for
kidnapping
in
muskogee
county,
because
according
to
our
statute,
the
venue,
in
kidnapping
cases
is
wherever
the
kidnapping
originated,
where
he
was
taken
or
in
any
county
through
which
he
is
carried,
or
in
any
county
into
which
he
is
brought.
so
that
there
were
--
both
counties
would
have
had
jurisdiction
and
the
county
which
tried
him
first
on
the
subject
would
have
ended
the
possibility
of
prosecuting
him
for
the
kidnapping.
if
he
had
been
charged
with
that
in
muskogee
county
and
they
tried
him
on
it,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
any
jurisdiction
in
tulsa
county.
so
far
as
the
murder
was
concerned
however
muskogee
county
was
the
only
one
that
did
have
venue.
that
occurred
in
muskogee
county.
tulsa
county
could
not
have
prosecuted
him
for
murder.
in
the
kidnapping
charge,
there
is
no
reference
to
the
murder,
no
reference
to
the
death
of
the
victim.
we
have
two
kidnapping
statutes.
one
of
them
applies
where
the
kidnapping
is
simply
for
the
purpose
of
detention.
the
other,
this
one,
applies
where
the
kidnapping
is
for
the
purpose
of
extortion;
money,
property,
or
thing
of
value
or
advantage.
it
has
been
held
to
include
a
kidnapping
for
the
purpose
of
rape.
it
might
be
held
to
include
also
the
purpose
of
kidnapping
for
taking
a
man's
life.
however,
that
was
not
charged
in
the
information
in
this
case.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
sir?
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
extortion
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
--
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
--
thing
of
value
--
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
--
or
advantage.
and
the
one
of
the
crimes
that
was
immediately
committed
in
further
--
pursuant
to
that
kidnapping
was
his
robbery
of
his
victim.
now,
that
was
charged
in
tulsa
county
and
there
isn't
any
contention
here
that
the
fact
that
he
was
charged
with
and
pled
guilty
with
the
crime
of
robbery
in
tulsa
county
was
any
bar
to
his
prosecution
for
the
kidnapping.
and
if
the
principle
for
which
they
contend
were
true
then
he
couldn't
have
been
prosecuted
for
both
the
kidnapping
and
robbery
in
tulsa
county
for
one
would
have
been
barred
with
the
other.
now,
in
our
own
opinion
in
this
case,
i'm
using
a
typewritten
copy
and
i
can't
give
you
the
page.
it
is
further
urged,
the
crime
of
kidnapping
merged
into
the
crime
of
murder,
now
in
that
connection
there,
i
call
attention
to
a
parallel
--
i
can't
present
you
a
case
where
a
man
was
charged
and
tried
both
for
kidnapping
and
for
murder,
this
isn't
in
--
the
one
i
present
to
you.
but
we
do
have
parallels
in
principle.
for
instance,
the
conspiracy
statute,
a
man
is
charged
with
conspiracy
and
he
may
also
be
charged
with
and
convicted
of
the
things
that
are
done
pursuant
to
the
conspiracy
because
the
court
has
held
that
they
are
separate
and
distinct
crimes
and
our
court
did
it
in
burns
case.
they're
not
the
same
and
that
one
does
not
merge
in
the
other
and
that
a
man
maybe
prosecuted
for
both.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
court
says
it
has
further
urged
the
crime
of
kidnapping
merged
into
the
crime
of
murder.
neither
of
these
contentions
are
talking
about
two
others
have
been
made
just
about
it.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
--
may
i
--
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
the
confessions
on
where
the
information
might
be
--
can
be
verified.
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
giving
the
history
of
the
case,
the
court
said
thereafter,
he
was
arrested
on
a
bus
by
a
member.
now,
he
had
--
had
paid
a
bus
driver
to
haul
him
over
into
another
part
of
eastern
oklahoma.
thereafter,
he
was
arrested
by
--
on
a
bus
by
a
member
of
the
highway
patrol
at
poteau,
oklahoma.
and
a
short
time
later
confessed
the
murder
of
tommy
cooke,
taking
the
officers
to
the
point
in
le
flore
county,
oklahoma,
where
he
had
disposed
of
the
gun,
which
the
officers
recovered
and
which
ballistic
experts
established
was
the
gun
that
killed
cooke.
another
question
was
asked
several
times
with
reference
to
the
procedure
of
the
court
in
volume
--
sections
973,
that's
a
sequence
here.
the
court
passed
on
that
very
clearly
in
this
case.
when
--
the
court
referring
to
that
contention
said
that
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
both
the
provisions
of
974
and
973
are
contingent
--
contingent
upon
the
request
for
evidence
under
the
provisions
of
974
and
975
are
contingent
upon
the
request
for
evidence
under
the
provisions
of
973
or
is
--
it
was
in
the
trial
court's
discretion
to
pursue
some
other
reasonable
method,
and
that's
the
question.
when
the
parties
fail
to
make
a
request
for
the
privilege
thereof,
the
same
is
waived
and
some
other
method
of
supplying
the
court
with
the
necessary
information
for
the
pronouncement
of
judgment
and
sentence
may
be
substituted
therefore.
i
am
citing
a
large
number
of
cases
from
other
states.
it
is
therefore
--
in
this
record
at
no
time
did
the
defendant
attempt
to
invoke
the
principles
of
this
statute.
he
did
not,
at
any
time,
request
the
taking
of
evidence
in
mitigation
or
offered
the
slightest
statement
by
a
way
of
litigation.
he
only
asked
for
mercy,
something
he
did
not
show
the
victim.
we
are
therefore
of
the
opinion
that
the
defendant's
first
contention
under
both
the
law
and
the
facts
cannot
be
sustained.
in
that
connection,
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
in
the
making
of
those
statements,
the
county
attorney
wasn't
the
only
one
who
made
the
statement.
mr.
woodson,
who
represented
the
defendant,
made
an
extended
statement.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
coming
back
to
the
--
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
the
--
no,
sir.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
when
mr.
woodson
was
asked
if
he
had
anything
further
to
say
he
said
no.
and
then
when
the
court
asked
the
defendant
very
specifically
and
it's
set
out
in
both
--
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
--
the
opinions
of
the
judge
brett's
opinion
and
judge
powell's
opinion.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
said
he
had
nothing
further
to
say
and
that
all
of
the
statements
made
by
the
county
attorney
were
true.
with
reference
to
the
contention
as
to
the
merger,
our
court
said,
"it
is
further
urged
that
the
crime
of
kidnapping
merged
into
the
crime
of
murder.
neither
of
these
contentions
can
be
sustained
for
the
law
defines
murder
and
kidnapping
as
two
separate
and
distinct
offenses.
therefore,
there
would
not
be
such
as
--
be
such
things
as
merger
of
these
separate
offenses.
furthermore,
oklahoma
does
not
recognize
such
doctrine,"
citing
a
number
of
cases."
it
is
urged
that
these
crimes
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction,
but
such
fact
will
not
result
in
a
merger
of
these
separate
and
distinct
offenses,"
citing
another
case.
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
a
number
of
cases
to
which
i
will
not
have
reference
to
refer.
as
i
said
a
while
ago,
we
can't
present
you
a
case
just
on
the
exact
state
of
facts
but
we
do
have
the
parallels
and
i
refer
to
a
charge
of
conspiracy,
which
our
court
has
held
repeatedly,
does
not
merge
in
the
offenses
that
are
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
and
i
reported
in
my
brief
to
several
other
cases
from
other
states,
including
cases
from
california,
where
they
expressly
held
that
there
was
no
merger.
in
the
case
of
morgan
versus
devine,
237
u.s.,
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
section
192
of
the
u.s.
penal
code
declares
it
to
be
a
crime
for
any
person
to
forcibly
break
into
or
attempt
to
break
into
any
post
office,
with
intent
to
commit
in
such
post
office
any
larceny
or
depredation.
section
190
makes
it
a
crime
to
steal,
purloin
or
embezzle
any
mail
bag
or
other
property
in
use
or
belonging
to
the
post
office
department
or
to
appropriate
any
such
property
to
one's
own
use
or
to
any
other
use
than
its
proper
use.
in
morgan
versus
devine,
the
court
held
that
the
breaking
into
the
post
office
in
violation
of
192
did
not
merge
in
the
crime
of
larceny,
of
property
taken
out
of
the
post
office
and
that
the
two
crimes
under
these
two
sections
were
distinct
and
separate
crimes,
one
other
part
to
the
other.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
that
it
doesn't
mean
at
all
that
the
penalty
of
death
was
imposed
on
--
on
a
charge
of
murder
and
the
two
crimes
were
separate
and
distinct.
suppose
that
--
suppose
that
he
had
been
given
it
as
penalty
in
muskogee
county
--
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
--
it
would
--
yes,
sir,
it
would
not
have
prevented
the
court
in
tulsa
county
from
imposing
a
death
penalty
following
the
kidnapping.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
certainly
he
took
into
consideration.
they
murdered
a
felon.
if
he
hadn't
committed
anything
except
just
to
simply
kidnap
this
young
man
and
had
later
released
him
unharmed,
either
been
given
a
pardon
or
life
penalty.
now,
we
wouldn't
have
such
a
wide
stretch
in
the
penalty
law,
going
all
the
--
going
all
the
way
--
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
no,
sir,
it
was
the
second
--
it
was
a
heavier
penalty
for
kidnapping.
in
--
in
imposing
the
penalty
in
a
kidnapping
case,
the
court
is
going
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
things
that
it
done,
following
that
kidnapping,
your
federal
statute
provides
for
a
death
penalty
but
prevents
its
imposition
if
the
victim
is
released
unharmed.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
yes.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
he
also
--
yes,
sir,
he
also
took
into
consideration
crime
of
robbery
for
which
he
had
given
him
50
years.
he
also
took
into
consideration
the
other
crimes
that
he
--
he
perpetrated.
the
whole
thing
came
into
the
picture
--
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
well,
there
isn't
any
denial
at
all
that
the
fact
that
he
took
that
into
consideration.
but
he
could
have
done
that
if
he
had
received
a
death
penalty
in
this
court
again.
he
wouldn't
have
barred
that.
there
isn't
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
sam
h.
lattimore
i
have
cited
other
parallels
in
my
brief
beside
that
of
conspiracy.
and
this
federal
case
is
arising
under
those
two
statutes.
the
second
offense
statutes
constitute,
to
me,
a
parallel
on
the
same
principle,
and
i
haven't
cited
the
cases
because
there
are
so
many
of
them.
but
in
this
court
here,
this
court
in
the
case
of
graham
versus
west
virginia,
in
224
u.s.
went
into
the
subject
of
these
second
offense
statutes.
and
this
court
said
that
even
though
the
former
conviction
is
taken
into
consideration
in
giving
the
man
a
heavier
punishment
for
the
second
offense,
he
is
not
being
sentenced
because
of
the
--
and
or
punished
because
of
the
former
conviction.
but
this
is
a
new
punishment
but
a
heavier
one
imposed
because
of
his
first
conviction.
and
in
the
last
case
that
was
before
this
court,
it
came
up
from
the
supreme
--
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
kansas,
involved
this
question
and
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question,
and
that's
in
the
--
law
addition,
the
u.s.
--
and
that's
exactly
--
in
my
opinion
is
what
ought
to
be
done
with
this
case.
