mr.
frederick
t.
gray
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
as
always
when
i
commence
an
argument
i'd
--
i've
been
held
to
say
about
12
different
things
at
once
because
there
are
so
many
things
particularly
when
you
follow
learned
from
the
counsel
on
the
other
side.
but
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
in
opening
to
--
if
they
would
please
look
at
page
31
of
the
record
because
i
can
see
that
a
good
deal
of
the
argument
that
has
been
heard
has
had
to
do
with
the
amount
of
the
tax.
and
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
31
of
the
record,
the
appellant's
only
witness
is
leaving
the
stand,
mr.
callaway
asked,
“have
you
any
other
witnesses
mr.
gay?”
and
mr.
gay
says,
“no
that
is
our
case.”
then
if
you
would
turn
to
page
32,
so
little
had
been
said
about
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
commissioner
callaway
asked
-
“in
your
petition
you
have
a
paragraph
stating
that
the
amount
of
the
tax,
the
amount
of
$139,000
was
not
correctly
computed,
do
you
now
waive
that
point?”
“no
sir
we
don't
waive
it
because
now
opinion
from
a
legal
standpoint
there
is
no
way
that
a
tax
could
be
computed
with
a
yearly
franchise
tax
of
the
state
of
virginia
based
on
gross
receipts
which
would
not
be
unconstitutional.”
now,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
the
commission
and
the
virginia
court
both
felt
that
the
only
issue
which
was
being
raised
here
seriously
and
which
was
being
litigated
here
was
whether
this
was
a
property
tax
or
whether
this
was
a
--
same
old
privilege
tax
and
the
amount
of
the
tax
has
never
really
since
gone
into
fully
by
the
commission
or
by
the
virginia
court.
now
next
i
feel
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
no
your
honor.
not
the
amount
of
the
tax
has
been
determined
from
that
standing
point.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
have
to
say
that
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
really
did
not
put
on
any
evidence
to
show
that
this
tax
was
not
correctly
computed
though.
that
it
just
--
it
wasn't
put
that
way.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no.
they
challenged
the
fact
that
a
$139,000
tax
just
as
mr.
gay's
argument
has
done
today
but
$139,000
tax
that
is
so
excessive
that
it
couldn't
possibly
be
imposed
against
them.
but
the
formula
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes
that's
the
--
one
of
the
important
facts
of
this
case
which
i
believe
will
draw
a
contest
in
this
case
in
the
prior
appeal
between
these
two
parties
is
the
fact
that
all
of
the
property
of
this
appellant,
the
delaware
corporation,
is
being
used
in
intrastate
commerce
and
the
delaware
corporation
is
compensated
for
the
use
of
that
property
in
intrastate
commerce.
now
that
comes
about
in
this
manner.
the
delaware
corporation
has
a
contract
with
the
various
carriers
throughout
the
country,
177
railroads,
a
number
of
airlines,
boat
lines
and
electric
lines
many
of
which
operate
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
under
this
contract
with
the
various
carriers,
the
delaware
company
has
obligations
to
perform
express
services
intrastate
within
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
now
it
had
the
problem
of
doing
intrastate
business
in
virginia
as
a
foreign
public
service
corporation
so
it
created
a
wholly-owned,
wholly-controlled
virginia
subsidiary,
which
i
shall
call
the
virginia
corporation,
the
virginia
company.
it
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
virginia
company
under
the
terms
of
which
the
virginia
company
is
obligated
to
perform
the
intrastate
activities
and
obligations
of
the
delaware
company.
it
does
not
go
out
and
make
its
own
contracts.
it
performs
the
obligations
of
the
delaware
company
in
virginia.
and
under
the
contract
the
delaware
company
agreed
to
permit
the
virginia
company
to
use
its
property
in
the
performance
of
the
interstate
function
and
under
the
contract
the
del
--
the
virginia
company
agreed
to
turn
over
to
the
delaware
company
all
of
its
revenue
and
the
delaware
company
assumes
all
the
bills
and
saves
the
virginia
company
owns.
so,
that
we
have
a
situation
of
a
foreign
corporation,
not
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
but
permitting
its
wholly-owned
and
controlled
subsidiary
could
use
its
property
to
engage
in
intrastate
commerce,
and
the
parent
corporation
receiving
all
of
the
revenue.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
stipulation
in
the
record
that
delaware
company
does
no
intrastate
commerce
in
virginia.
what
a
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
am
not
suggesting,
sir
that
the
delaware
company
does
intrastate
commerce.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
permits
its
property
in
virginia
to
be
used
in
intrastate
commerce.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that
was
not
--
that
was
of
the
virginia
constitution,
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
fact
the
corporation
does
not
engage
in
intrastate
commerce
is
a
consequence
of
the
virginia
constitution.
the
fact
that
it
permits
its
property
to
be
used
in
virginia
is
not
a
consequence
of
the
constitution
of
virginia.
it
is
done
and
it's
testified
to
by
mr.
(inaudible),
it
is
done
for
the
economic
advantage
of
the
company
–
that's
why
they
do
it
–
because
it
is
economically
advantageous
to
them
to
permit
the
virginia
company
to
use
that
property
and
do
it;
they
don't
have
to
do
that
under
our
constitution
at
all.
now
i
make
this
point
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
for
two
reasons.
one,
i
believe
that
the
use
of
the
property
in
the
state
would
afford
a
basis
for
taxation
and
secondly,
because
from
a
factual
standpoint
when
you
deal
with
the
amount
of
the
tax
and
the
value
of
the
delaware
company's
property,
i
believe
it
can
readily
be
seen
that
the
privilege
of
using,
having
the
joint
use
of
properties
between
these
two
companies
would
make
the
delaware
company's
property
in
virginia
more
valuable.
a
truck,
one
truck,
which
has
the
privilege
along
with
it
of
using
two
other
trucks,
is
certainly
more
valuable
than
one
truck
standing
alone.
so
that
the
virginia
company
--
the
delaware
company's
property
has
increased
value
because
it
can
be
used
in
conjunction
with
the
virginia
company's
value
for
more
compensation.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
it's
available.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
believe
that
your
honor,
please
the
stipulation
precludes
my
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
from
insisting
that
they
do
intrastate
business.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
also,
this
joint
use
of
property
is
important
when
we
get
to
the
--
to
the
other
argument
which
has
not
been
reached
in
oral
argument
but
it
was
contained
in
the
brief
that
due
to
the
proportion
of
the
tax
or
the
revenues
which
are
attributable
to
virginia,
it
was
said
in
our
brief
that
the
1.7
of
the
revenues
are
attributed
to
virginia
under
the
formula
whereas,
only
six-tenths
of
1%
of
their
property
is
located
in
virginia.
obviously,
because
part
of
their
ownership
is
in
a
separate
corporation
in
virginia
that
is
going
to
follow
that
their
revenues
in
virginia,
since
they
can
use
the
virginia
property
to
help
earn
those
revenues,
their
--
their
revenues
will
be
proportionately
greater
in
virginia.
now,
i
would
like
also
in
the
very
early
stages,
to
comment
upon
the
amendments
to
this
act.
i
believe,
technically,
this
was
not
--
mr.
justice
brennan
this
statute,
it
was
an
amendment
and
reenactment
of
the
old
act.
the
appellant
says
that
there
were
three
changes
and
only
three
changes
made
in
this
law.
well,
after
this
part
of
the
field
was
decided,
virginia
has
re-funded
the
taxes
through
the
entire
period
of
limitation
and
did
not
thereafter
assess
the
so-called
license
act
against
the
appellate.
and
in
1956
they
re-amend
--
they
amended
and
reenacted
the
statute.
appellant
says
it
is
identical
in
all
material
respects
and
made
only
were
only
three
changes.
one,
they
changed
the
name;
two,
they
make
it
in
lieu
of
rather
than
in
addition
to
certain
other
state
property
taxes;
and
three,
that
they
omitted
the
phrase
that
is,
“for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
virginia.”
we
say
that
there
were
three
additional
very
material
changes
in
this
tax.
the
first
of
these
is
this.
under
the
1954
statute,
there
was
contained
in
the
statute
a
provision
that
the
intangible
property
of
express
company
should
be
taxed
at
the
rate
of
50
cents
per
$100
in
value
and
that
the
money
of
express
company
should
be
taxed
at
the
rate
of
20
cents
per
$100
in
value.
both
of
those
taxes
were
received
in
the
process
of
amending
and
re-enacting
this
act
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
the
use
of
this
50
cents
per
$100
value
formula
which
runs
their
going
concern
value
up
to
$27
million,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
believe
you
were
having
trouble
with
how
we
arrived
with
a
$27
million
figure,
but
he
does
define
a
very
simple
process
of
taking
the
amount
of
the
tax
$139,000
and
he
says
“if
you
were
going
to
raise
$139,000
taxes
using
the
tax
rate
of
50
cents
per
100
you'd
have
to
have
$27
million
in
value.”
well
the
fallacy
in
the
argument
is
that
there
isn't
a
tax
rate
of
50
cents
per
$100
in
value
applicable
to
express
companies.
there
was
found
in
the
prior
appeal
and
this
court
used
that
very
mathematical
process
in
the
opinion
of
saying
that
if
you
treated
it
as
an
intangible
property,
the
tax
rate
on
intangible
was
this
50
cents
per
100
then
it
would
have
to
have
a
value
of
x
number
of
million
dollars.
but
where
there
is
no
such
tax
rate
applicable
to
express
companies;
that's
just
dreaming
up
a
tax
formula.
we
may
as
well
use
10
cents
on
$100
and
make
it
$250
million
in
value
that
you'd
have
to
have.
the
tax
rate,
if
there
has
to
be
a
tax
rate,
the
tax
rate
here
is
$2.15
--
that's
the
tax
rate
if
--
if
you
have
to
find
value
and
rate
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
tax.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
believe,
under
the
court's
decisions,
your
honor
that
it
could
not
exceed
a
sum
which
could
be
levied
against
that
could
be
not
constitutionally
levied.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that's
right,
exactly.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
we
don't
really
know.
that
is
--
that
is
why
i
say
your
honor
that
we
didn't
go
in
to
the
amount
of
these
taxes
in
that
sense.
what
is
the
value
of
their
contract?
that's
--
that
is
the
answer.
what
is
the
value?
what
would
one
pay
for
a
--
an
exclusive
privilege
to
ship
express
material
over
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
a
monopoly
in
a
contract
which
is
indeterminant
in
rate?
i
don't
know
what
it's
worth.
i
don't
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
what
would
railway
express
pay
you
today,
your
honor
to
buy
that
contract
and
to
buy
the
clause
of
the
contract?
what
other
privilege
is
worth?
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that
would
measure
the
value
of
the
privileges
to
the
company
too
--
to
the
express
company.
what
would
you
pay
to
continue
these
privileges?
they
paid
$2.5
million
in
1956
for
the
privilege.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
if
your
honor,
please,
we
say
that
the
worth
of
the
contract
is
the
worth
of
the
privileges
which
they
enjoy.
what
they
do
with
their
income
after
they
get
it
we
can't
control
that
but
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it
does
value.
i
think
it
has
potential
value.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well
they
can't
--
they
don't
keep
anything
on
it.
they
are
as
a
separate
corporate
entity.
they
like
to
give
their
proceeds
away.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well
of
course
the
railroads
are
the
owners
of
the
company.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
they
took
that
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
not
on
this
income.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
pay
taxes
on
their
income.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
if
your
honor,
please,
i
--
in
trying
to
work
here
some
–
it
falls
along
that
line.
it
seems
to
me
it
works
out
this
way.
if
i
were
permitted
to
take
my
income
and
assign
part
of
it
to
my
groceries,
and
part
of
it
to
my
doctor,
and
part
of
it
to
my
clothing
store,
and
part
of
it
to
my
fuel
bill
so
that
i
would
have
no
net
income
for
the
federal
government
to
tax,
this
tax
is
all
in
the
hands
of
the
people
that
i
purchased
from.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
–
you're
missing
one
step
of
the
tax,
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
what
i
believe
is
the
answer
to
is
your
honor,
if
your
honor
please,
is
if
railway
express
agency
of
delaware
is
not
a
separate
corporation
then
the
virginia
company
is
not
a
separate
corporation.
now
we
have
no
problem
because
then
they
are
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce.
i
don't
think
you
can
separate
one
of
them
and
not
separate
the
other
and
i
don't
think
you
can
tie
on
the
other
end
without
tying
the
other.
if
--
if
we're
going
to
say
that
the
express
company
of
delaware
is
really
a
part
of
the
railroads
then
the
virginia
company
is
merely
a
part
of
the
railroads
too,
and
they're
doing
an
intrastate
commerce
in
virginia.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
to
try
to
complete
just
the
two
other
changes
in
the
statute
now
before
the
lunch
hour,
i
have
mentioned
that
they
took
out
the
tax
on
intangibles;
they
took
out
the
tax
on
the
money.
they
also
amended
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
include
within
rolling
stock,
within
the
term
“rolling
stock,”
automotive
equipment.
now
the
appellant
has
never
conceded
that
that
statute
was
changed
to
that
effect
and
they
still
contend
that
the
corporation
commission
made
a
strained
construction
in
order
to
get
to
that,
but
regardless
of
whether
it
was
strained
or
unstrained,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
determined
that
under
the
amended
statute,
the
automotive
equipment
and
trucks
are
exempt
from
taxation
in
virginia.
that
was
an
additional
change
of
the
statute
claimed
and
the
final
change
is
that
the
mileage
formula,
which
was
contained
in
the
prior
statute,
is
not
contained
in
this
statute,
the
apportioned
that
formula,
they
--
they
apportioned
the
formula
by
mileage.
under
the
present
statute,
the
way
that
you
arrive
at
gross
receipts
is
for
the
company
to
report
what
its
gross
receipts
are.
and
the
only
reason
we
ever
came
to
a
mileage
or
an
apportionment
formula
in
this
case
is
that
the
company
failed
to
report
its
gross
receipt.
at

“all
receipts
earned
in
virginia
on
business
passing
through
into
or
out
of
this
state”
and
the
answer
which
they
gave
was
“none.”
and
they
appended
a
statement
saying
we
--
we
have
no
way
of
determining
what
our
gross
receipts
are.
now
in
reply
brief
the
first
time
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
thank
you,
sir.
as
we
pause
for
recess,
if
your
honors
please,
i
was
concluding
my
remark
with
respect
to
the
three
additional
changes
in
the
statute
which
we
say
were
made
and
which
appellants
have
failed
to
recognize
as
being
changes
in
the
statute.
it's
been
pointed
out
that
the
mileage
formula
which
was
formerly
in
the
statute,
the
apportionment
formula
is
not
in
this
statute
and
that
the
appellant,
in
making
its
return,
did
not
attempt
to
assert
any
value
for
gross
receipts
in
virginia
at
all
but
rather
answer
that
it
had
no
gross
receipts
in
virginia.
and
the
commission
had
to
apply
the
section
of
the
law
which
provides
that
where
a
--
a
taxpayer
fails
or
refuses
to
report,
they
shall
make
the
return
on
the
best
information
available.
and
in
so
doing,
the
commission
has
reached
a
mileage
formula
to
determine
what
gross
receipts
are.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
a
rather
strange
concept
that
a
taxpayer
can
thus
fail
to
report,
and
then
come
into
court
and
complain
that
i
didn't
know
what
my
gross
receipts
were,
and
i
didn't
report
any
gross
receipts
but
the
method
you
use
is
wrong.
either
they
did
know
or
didn't
know.
the
position
they
take
is
we
don't
know
what
our
receipts
were
but
we
do
know
that
what
you
say
our
receipts
were
--
were
not
our
receipts
in
virginia.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
if
it
were
not
a
property
tax.
if
your
honor
please,
if
this
is
not
a
property
tax,
the
only
basis
on
which
i
say
that
the
tax
could
be
sustained
would
be
that
by
virtue
of
the
use
of
its
property,
the
delaware
company's
property
by
the
virginia
company
that
that
would
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
tax.
that
is
the
only
other
basis
on
which
it
could
be
sustained.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
believe
substantially
that
mr.
gay,
when
he
stated
that
the
noble
of
this
case
is
whether
a
gross
receipts
tax
can
be
used
to
measure
property
taxes
in
lieu
of
which
the
gross
receipt
tax
is
levied,
that
is
the
part
of
this
matter.
and
if
--
if
the
decisions
of
the
court
are
such
that
no
gross
receipts
tax,
no
matter
how
fairly
apportioned
or
no
matter
what
property
it
stands
in
lieu
of,
if
gross
receipts
as
such
can
never
be
used
as
a
measure
of
a
property
tax,
then
i
think
i
have
very
rough
pleading
from
therein.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
we
do
not
believe
that
the
cases
of
this
court
are
to
that
effect.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
oh.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that
would
go
to
amount.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
oh,
that's
correct.
but
i
think
the
answer
--
in
answer
to
--
to
the
question
that
if
--
if
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
that
you
can
never
have
a
gross
receipts
tax,
if
--
if
the
fact
that
it's
gross
receipts
denotes
it
as
a
privilege
tax,
then
i
don't
get
to
amount.
i'll
stop
it
below.
i
say,
in
connection
with
that,
now,
i
would
like
to
get
in
to
what
i
conceived
to
be
the
nature
of
this
tax
and
why
i
conceived
it
would
be
nature.
the
court
will
remember
that
under
the
prior
tax,
there
was
a
decided
--
a
divided
opinion
of
the
court.
the
court
was
divided
5-to-4
as
to
the
nature
of
the
prior
tax.
and
the
majority
of
the
court,
as
we
read
the
opinions,
as
we
understand
what
the
court
held,
the
court
laid
great
stress
on
what
it
characterized
as
a
trinity
of
characterizations
which
it
found
in
the
statute
in
1954.
the
court
said,
we
start
with
the
taxing
statute
in
which
the
legislature
gave
a
trinity
of
characterizations
to
the
tax.
it
was
declared
to
be
in
addition
to
the
property
tax
not
an
additional
property
tax.
it
was
named
an
annual
license
tax.
it
was
laid
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
the
court
went
on,
it
is
not
an
easy
conclusion
that
the
legislature
did
not
know
the
actual
character
of
the
taxes
it
was
laying.
all
that
it
misconceived
what
it
was
taxing.
now,
to
look
at
the
amended
statute
in
the
light
of
that
language
of
the
court,
let
us
look
at
the
three
amendments
which
the
appellant
says
were
made
in
the
statute.
first,
he
says,
at
two
places
in
brief
and
repeated
in
oral
argument
today
that
one
of
the
amendment
was,
that
we
levied
a
tax
in
lieu
of
a
tax
on
other
property
rather
than
a
tax
in
addition
to
the
tax
on
other
property.
the
error
in
his
statement
is
that
the
old
tax
was
not
said
to
be
in
addition
to
a
tax
on
other
property.
it
was
said
to
be
a
tax
in
addition
to
the
tax
on
property
not
on
other
property.
and
this
court
used
that
as
one
of
the
trinity
of
characterizations
that
it
wasn't
an
additional
property
tax
or
tax
in
addition
to
the
tax
on
other
property.
this
time,
it
is
a
tax
in
lieu
of
a
tax
on
intangible
property
and
rolling
stock.
secondly,
the
court
found
that
it
was
labelled
a
license
tax.
we
certainly
agree.
we
urged
last
time
that
the
license
or
the
--
the
label
had
no
particular
significance.
we
still
make
that
argument.
but
now,
as
before,
we
have
taken
the
name
license
tax
off
of
it,
it
should
never
have
been
there
because
it
does
not
operate
as
a
license
tax.
licenses
are
not
issued.
it
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
the
doing
of
business
in
the
state
of
virginia.
it
just
doesn't
operate
as
license
tax.
and
the
collection
of
the
tax
is
left
to
the
ordinary
process,
it's
for
collection.
finally,
the
term
for
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
--
they
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
changed
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
it
is
merely
an
indicia
of
the
nature
of
the
tax.
it
is
one
of
the
things
which
the
court
the
found
to
be
an
indicia
of
the
nature
of
the
tax.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
now
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
if
your
honor
please.
but
i
think
in
this
particular
situation,
it
becomes
important
because
that
was
one
of
the
basis
on
which
the
court
reached
its
conclusion
last
time.
i
believe
in
--
in
argument
with
--
in
the
minnesota
case
on
yesterday,
your
honor
indicated
that
it
was
rather
difficult
for
the
court
to
--
even
though
a
state
court
may
say
this
is
a
property
tax,
it's
rather
difficult
when
the
language
of
the
statute
says
this
is
levied
for
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
doing
business
--
for
the
purpose
of
doing
business
in
the
state.
but
it's
rather
hard
to
make
the
jump
and
that
label
license
tax
was
taken
out
of
the
statute.
and
also
the
language
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
was
taken
out
of
the
statute.
the
minority
opinion
in
the
prior
case,
a
dissenting
opinion
seems
to
point
out
very
clearly
to
us
that
the
basis
of
decision
had
largely
been
the
fact
that
the
legislature
had
characterized
the
tax
as
a
privilege
tax
because
in
the
minority
opinion,
this
appears
in
some
virginia's
tax
should
not
be
held
unconstitutional
merely
because
of
the
name
the
state
legislature
gave
it.
the
constitutionality
of
a
state's
tax
laws
should
not
depend
on
ability
of
state
legislatures
to
foresee
what
tax
language
would
most
likely
meet
this
court's
approach.
now,
we
say
that
these
changes
which
were
made
not
only
change
the
label
of
the
tax
but
under
this
court's
decision,
change
the
nature
of
the
tax.
it
is
our
position
--
it
was
our
position
before
that
virginia
has
attempted
to
levy
a
property
tax.
its
constitution,
section
170
of
the
constitution
of
virginia
envisions
a
property
tax
on
this
type
of
corporation.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
this
--
public
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
public
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
public
service
corporation.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
any
other
property
tax
that's
measured
by
gross
receipts.
i
believe
not,
sir.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
are
--
they
are
tax
differently,
if
your
honor
please,
in
this
very
material
respect.
the
tangible
property
of
a
public
utility
is
taxed
by
the
localities.
the
constitution
provides
and
the
court
has
held
prior
to
--
with
respect
to
mode,
in
the
case
of
city
of
richmond
against
the
commonwealth,
the
court
has
held
that
in
assessing
the
value
of
tangible
property
for
local
taxation,
the
corporation
commission
must
consider
the
bare
bones
value
of
the
property
for
local
taxation.
that
the
going
concern
or
intangible
value
of
such
corporations
is
left
to
the
state
for
taxation
and
that
is
what
is
called
the
state
franchise
tax.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that's
the
office
of
the
american
railway.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
they
would
pay
income
taxes.
public
utilities
do
not
pay
income
tax.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
oh,
between
physical
property.
physical
property
of
the
grocery
business
would
be
taxed
by
the
locality
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
at
full
value.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
mean,
whatever
value
that
--
i
mean
whatever
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
formula
is
that
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
would
be
taxed
by
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
no,
no
--
not.
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
if
it's
a
public
utility,
it
would
be
taxed
the
same
way
that
this
--
just
as
the
virginia
company
is.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
there
is
absolute
and
no
distinction
or
discrimination
between
a
foreign
corporation
and
a
local
corporation
if
that
is
your
honor's
question.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
the
virginia
company
here
which
would
be
the
closest
analogy
we
could
find
in
the
same
business
is
taxed
exactly
the
same
way
that
this
company
is
taxed.
this
is
a
tax
against
all
express
companies
in
virginia
and
is
a
part
of
a
system
of
taxing
all
utilities
in
virginia.
they
all
tax
alike.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
just
--
just
speaking
to
(inaudible)
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
i
believe
under
one
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
clearly
as
anything
i
have
been
able
to
find
demonstrates
the
difference
between
this
tax
which
was
here
in
the
prior
case
and
the
tax
which
is
here
now.
in
the
cudahy
packing
company
case,
the
court
discusses
two
earlier
which
were
decided
by
this
court
on
the
same
--
very
same
day.
they
being
the
meyer
against
wells
fargo
and
the
united
states
express
company
case,
both
reported
in
223
us.
the
meyer
case,
there
was
a
gross
receipts
tax
which
was
levied
in
addition
to
the
tax
on
property.
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
bad,
that
was
a
void
tax,
that
there
was
--
since
there
was
a
tax
on
the
property
already,
you
couldn't
say
it
was
a
property
tax,
it
had
to
be
a
privilege
tax
and
therefore
the
tax
fell.
but
on
the
same
day,
they
decided
the
united
states
express
company
case
which
on
facts
is
very,
very
similar
to
this
case.
it
did
business
in
the
same
manner.
and
there,
the
gross
receipts
tax
was
levied
in
lieu
of
a
tax
on
property,
and
the
court
held
that
this
is
but
a
measure
of
the
value
of
the
corporation's
property
and
the
tax
was
sustained.
in
addition,
the
court
said
that
this
is
the
only
tax
in
the
state
that
falls
upon
this
property.
now,
when
this
case
was
here
before,
there
was
a
tax
of
50
cents
per
$100
in
value
in
the
statute
on
the
intangibles
of
the
company.
this
time,
that
tax
on
intangible
values
has
been
removed
from
the
statute.
and
if
this
tax
be
stricken,
there
will
be
no
tax
in
virginia
which
reaches
the
going
concern
or
goodwill
value
of
this
property
at
all.
the
localities
are
taxing
the
tangible
property
merely
on
its
bare
bones
value.
the
goodwill
or
going
concern
value
which
no
one
denies
exist
in
a
going
corporation
is
completely
immune
from
tax
unless
it'd
be
reach
by
this
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
it
does
not
follow,
no,
your
honor.
we
say
that
we
are
reaching
it
this
way
and
measuring
it
by
gross
receipts,
but
that
is
what
this
tax
is.
it
is
a
gross
receipts
tax
in
lieu
of
a
tax
on
property.
now,
the
appellant
cites
the
united
states
glue
company
case
has
authority
for
the
proposition
that
gross
receipts
cannot
be
used
to
measure
going
concern
value
or
property
values
that
gross
receipts
indicates
a
privilege
tax
and
it
always
has
to
be
a
privilege
tax
if
it's
measured
by
gross
receipts.
in
the
first
place,
the
united
states
glue
company
case,
it
was
decided
in
1918,
it
did
not
have
--
the
court
did
not
have
before
a
gross
receipts
tax.
it
had
before
a
net
tax.
and
--
and
what
we
submit
was
dicta,
the
court
said
that
a
net
tax
does
not
have
the
vice
which
could
be
inherit
in
a
gross
receipts
tax.
and
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
gwin
case
pointed
out
that
u.s.
glue,
the
comments
with
respect
to
gross
receipts
in
u.s.
glue
was
really
dicta.
as
we
have
read
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
gross
receipts
taxes,
those
taxes
which
have
fallen,
fell
because
they
were
not
fairly
or
properly
apportioned
within
the
state.
they
have
not
fallen
just
because
the
tax
was
a
gross
receipts
tax.
and
in
that
connection,
there
is
in
the
case
of
western
live
stock,
mr.
justice
stone's
opinion
a
discussion
of
gross
receipts
taxes.
and
if
i
may
just
very
briefly,
i
will
not
try
to
read
it
in
full
but
just
to
hit
the
highlights
of
it.
taxation
measured
by
gross
receipts
from
interstate
commerce
has
been
sustained
when
fairly
apportioned
to
the
commerce
carried
on
within
the
taxing
state.
say,
maine
--
maine
against
grand
trunk,
cudahy
packing,
united
states
express
against
minnesota,
which
i
have
just
referred
to
you,
has
been
rejected
in
other
cases
only
because
the
apportionment
was
found
to
be
inadequate
or
unfair.
now,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
it
is
a
practical
way
of
laying
upon
commerce
its
share
of
the
local
tax
burden
without
subjecting
it
to
multiple
taxation,
it
would
be
fairly
apportioned.
as
we
read
the
prior
decision
of
this
court,
we
understood
the
prior
decision
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
would
not
have
gone
to
the
great
lengths
that
it
did
go
to
analyze
the
virginia
tax
to
point
out
that
it
was
labeled
license
tax,
that
it
was
said
to
be
in
addition
to
property
and
that
it
was
said
to
be
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
if
the
law
is
that
a
gross
receipts
tax
per
se
is
a
privilege
tax,
the
court
could
have
said
that
and
no
more
in
the
prior
virginia
case.
they
could
merely
have
said,
"this
tax
is
measured
by
gross
receipts
hence,
it
is
a
privilege
tax,
hence,
it
has
to
fall
under
the
facts
of
this
case."
now,
we
--
we
do
not
believed
that
this
court
has
laid
down
a
rule
that
every
gross
receipts
tax,
no
matter
how
fairly
apportioned
is
invalid.
i
see
that
i
--
my
time
is
quickly
passing.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
a
few
other
factors.
that
number
one,
the
constitution
of
virginia
in
section
170
provides
that
we
can
levy
a
franchise
tax
in
lieu
of
a
tax
or
other
property
or
corporation
such
as
this.
so
that
the
constitution
--
the
language
of
the
constitution,
when
it
says
in
lieu
of
a
tax
on
other
property,
clearly
envisions
this
type
of
tax
to
be
a
tax
on
the
going
concern
or
the
intangible
value
of
the
corporation.
that
was
what
it
meant.
the
debates,
some
of
the
debates
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
it
can
clearly
be
seen
from
those
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
envision
a
system
of
taxation
where
the
going
concern
value
would
be
reached
by
tax
measured
by
gross
receipts.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
if
your
honor,
i
--
excuse
me.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
did
not
refer
to
it
directly.
i
--
i
--
it
is
referred
to
in
brief
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
i
--
i
believe
you
would
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
that's
right.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
believe
we
had
some
comments
with
respect
to
the
galveston
case
last
time
in
the
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
interpretation
that
i
put
on
maine
against
grand
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
--
trunk
if
i
recall
correctly.
we
submit
--
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
of
course,
if
we
are
taxing
the
privilege,
there
is
no
question.
and
as
the
virginia
court
had
recognized
that
very
recently
wherein
in
the
olan
mills
case
where
the
photographers
were
coming
in
and
doing
business.
and
--
and
the
virginia
court
itself
brought
down
local
license
taxes
against
this
people,
then
you
can't
so
burden
this
company.
but
whereas
here,
the
state
sets
up
a
system
of
taxation
and
says,
“now,
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
it
all
the
value
of
this
company,
all
of
their
value.
their
bare
bones,
their
tracks,
their
bridges,
their
trucks,
everything
they
have.”
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
are
fairly
entitled
to
tax
the
intangible
element
of
value
which
it
has
as
a
going
concern.
that
piece
of
track
is
worth
nothing
but
as
a
part
of
this
railroad,
it
has
a
value.
now,
in
order
to
do
this,
we
are
going
to
allow
the
localities
to
tax
the
bare
bones.
no
good
will,
no
going
concern
value
but
mere
bare
bones.
and
we
are
going
to
allow
the
state
to
impose
what
is
called
a
“franchise
tax”
measured
by
the
gross
receipts
of
this
company
to
reach
this
increment
of
the
value
of
this
corporation.
now,
that
is
a
scheme
of
taxation.
then
they
go
on
and
say,
“when
you
have
done
that,
then
we
will
not
tax
the
dividend
of
this
company
in
the
hands
of
its
own.
that
we
have
gone
far
in
--
in
the
stockholders.
and
we
have
gone
far
enough
when
we
get
all
of
the
value,
then
that's
all
that
we
should
tax.”
that
is
the
virginia
scheme
of
taxation.
now,
we
say
that
it
is
a
fair
scheme
and
it
does
not
over
burden
or
does
not
burden
interstate
commerce.
it
certainly
does
not
discriminate
to
use
just
a
little
--
something
little
straight
which
is
in
the
brief
to
point
up
what
we
would
come
to
this
tax
falls
in
virginia.
two
shipments
could
be
made
out
of
the
city
of
richmond,
one
going
to
bristol,
virginia,
one
going
to
bristol,
tennessee
across
the
street
from
one
another.
they
could
be
held
by
the
same
employee
of
this
company.
they
could
be
written
up
on
the
same
bill
of
lading.
they
could
ride
in
the
same
trucks,
in
the
same
railroad
cars
and
one
of
them
would
be
taxed
because
it's
intrastate,
the
other
with
state
tax
because
it
goes
across
the
street
to
tennessee.
so,
certainly
we
can
see
that
there
is
no
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
under
this
scheme
of
taxation.
what
we
are
trying
to
reach
is
a
tax
on
the
going
concern
value
measured
by
what
we
conceive
to
be
a
fairly
apportioned
gross
receipt.
mr.
frederick
t.
gray
well,
[laughter]
--
well,
i
would
certainly
have
to
read
the
decision
first,
if
your
honor
please.[laughter]
