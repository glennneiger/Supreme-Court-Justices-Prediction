mr.
thomas
b.
gay
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
railway
express
agency
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
which
has
found
an
order
of
the
state
corporation
commission
imposing
upon
the
appellant
a
“franchise
tax”
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$140,000
based
on
what
it
--
determined
to
be
its
intrastate
gross
receipts
for
the
preceding
year
of
1955
of
roughly
$6.5
million.
the
tax
is
said
to
be
a
--
a
franchise
tax
imposed
in
lieu
of
taxes
on
other
intangible
property
and
rolling
stock.
the
applicable
statutes
are
printed
in
appendix
a
to
the
white
book
in
our
opening
brief,
and
it
might
probably
use
for
the
purpose
to
read
the
first
two
sections
which
are
the
applicable
statutes,
page29.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
no,
this
is
a
--
the
same
tax
under
a
different
name,
but
it's
not
the
same
statute,
your
honor,
please.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
passed
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1954.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
no,
it
was
an
entirely
new
statute.
the
--
the
old
law
is
printed
in
appendix
b
and
if
the
court
care
to
do
so
it
--
you
can
see
the
differences,
if
any,
between
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
i
desire
to
do
that,
your
honor
because
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
positions
that
we
wish
to
take.
section
58-546
says
“franchise
tax”
on
express
companies;
“each
express
company
doing
business
in
this
state
shall
on
or
before
the
first
day
of
june
of
each
year
pay
to
the
state
a
franchise
tax
which
shall
be
in
lieu
of
taxes
upon
all
of
its
other
intangible
property
and
in
lieu
of
property
taxes
on
its
rolling
stock.”
the
next
section,
model
franchise
tax;
“the
franchise
tax
shall
be
equal
to
2
3/20
%
of
the
gross
receipts
derived
from
operations
within
the
state.
if
its
operations
are
partly
within
and
part
of
an
intrastate
the
gross
receipts
derived
from
operations
within
the
state
shall
be
deemed
to
be
all
receipts
on
business
beginning
and
ending
within
the
state,
and
all
receipts
derived
from
transportation
within
the
state
of
express
transported
through,
into
or
out
of
the
state.”
although,
the
question
is
not
before
the
court,
in
view
of
what
i
understand
to
be
its
acceptance
of
interpretation
of
constitutional
and
statutory
application
by
state
courts,
it
is
significant
and
i
--
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
since
the
commission
under
virginia
court
held
that
this
tax
was
imposed
pursuant
to
the
authority
conferred
by
section
170
of
the
constitution
of
virginia,
and
that
section
reads
“the
general
assembly
may
impose
state
franchise
taxes,
and
in
imposing
a
franchise
tax
may,
in
its
discretion,
make
the
same
in
lieu
of
taxes
upon
other
property,
in
whole
or
in
part,
of
a
transportation,
industrial
or
commercial
corporation.”
now
it
is
our
contention
in
the
lower
court
and
we
think
that
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
two
sections
of
the
constitution
makes
it
apparent
that
that
section
in
authorizing
the
imposition
of
a
franchise
tax
had
reference
only
to
corporations
doing
as
a
fully
and
intrastate
business,
or
at
least
on
inter
--
any
intrastate
business
since
section
163
of
the
constitution
inhibits
any
foreign
corporation,
no
foreign
corporation
shall
be
authorized
to
carry
on
in
the
state
the
business
or
to
exercise
any
of
the
powers
or
functions
of
a
public
service
corporation.
so
we
urged
upon
the
law
of
court
that
this
section
170,
authorizing
the
imposition
of
franchise
taxes,
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
related
section
of
the
constitution
to
mean
and
to
apply
to,
and
to
authorize
the
imposition
of
franchise
taxes
on
only
those
corporations
that
you
are
indeed
solely
in
intrastate
business
or
inter
and
intrastate
business.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
we
were
inhibited
from
being
licensed
as
this
court
held
--
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
i'd
like
to
answer
that
by
saying
that
when
the
--
if
i
may
anticipate
my
argument
a
little
bit,
in
1928
when
the
express
company
was
organized
–
it
was
a
delaware
corporation.
it
was
qualified
to
do
business
intra
and
interstate
in
every
state
in
the
union.
it
applied
to
the
state
of
virginia
for
authority
to
do
an
intrastate
business,
was
denied
by
the
corporation
commission
under
this
section
163
of
the
constitution,
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
affirmed
and
this
court
affirmed
that
decision.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
yes,
sir
--
actually
interstate
business.
now
appellant
contends
that
the
tax
imposed
on
it
in
this
case,
although
named
or
called
a
“franchise
tax,”
and
although
stated
to
be
in
lieu
of
certain
property
taxes,
is
nothing
but
the
old
license
tax
which
was
previously
before
this
court
and
therefore,
it's
--
it's
a
privilege
imposed
upon
the
right
to
transact
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
void
of
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause;
and
secondly,
that
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
such
and
the
amount
in
which
it
was
assessed
is
such
as
to
constitute
denial
of
due
process
in
the
substantive
sense
to
the
appellant
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
we
don't
think
under
the
constitution
170
it
could
impose
or
even
you
know
a
property
tax
--
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
i'll
answer
that
this
way.
under
the
constitutional
system
in
virginia,
there
is
a
segregation
of
property
for
state
purposes
and
for
local
purposes.
all
intangible
property
is
segregated
for
state
taxation;
all
tangible
--
personal
property
and
real
estate
--
is
segregated
for
local
taxation.
now
our
contention
is
that
the
state
of
virginia
has
the
perfect
right
to
try
and
to
--
to
tax
any
intangible
element
of
value
that
this
corporation
may
have
in
--
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
they
did
so.
so
the
tax
was
paid.
it
also
had
the
right
to
pay
a
tax
rolling
stock,
it
did
so
and
the
tax
was
paid.
but
it
has
--
and
the
courts
found
that
this
tax
is
a
tax
upon
the
going
concern
of
goodwill
value
of
the
business,
and
the
whole
nub
of
case
is
that
you
can't
measure
goodwill
or
going
concern
value
by
gross
receipts.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
it
no
longer
taxes
receivables
or
rolling
stock.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
that,
if
i
may,
anticipate
what
i'm
about
to
say
that
assuming,
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
has
not
violated
with
the
commerce
clause
we'd
get
into
that
element
of
my
--
our
case
which
goes
to
their
amount
of
the
tax.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
now
as
i've
said
the
--
this
statute
that
one's
that's
been
enacted
1906
resulted
from
the
prior
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
railway
express
agency
versus
virginia
which
was
decided
in
1954.
in
that
case,
a
license
tax
was
imposed
upon
the
appellate
for
the
privilege
of
conducting
its
business
in
the
state.
now
appellant
here
in
this
appeal
contends
that
under
the
doctrine
respect
the
case
and
under
the
rule
of
law
laid
down
in
the
prior
decision
between
the
same
party
in
1954,
that
the
tax
imposed
under
the
present
statute
being
on
gross
receipts
just
as
it
was
in
the
prior
act,
and
since
those
gross
receipts
are
derived
exclusively
from
interstate
commerce,
that
the
tax
is
in
fact
a
privilege
and
not
a
property
tax.
if
i
may
give
just
a
brief
historical
statement
as
to
the
nature
of
this
company's
business
and
the
prior
litigation
between
it
and
the
state
so
that
in
that
background
the
court
may
better
understand
the
issue
arising
here.
as
i've
said,
the
express
when
it
was
organized
in
1928
to
take
over
all
the
express
business.
it
was
organized
by
the
railroad
and
is
presently
owned
by
the
railroad.
it
went
to
and
obtained
authority
to
do
business
in
every
state
in
the
union,
interstate
and
intrastate
except
the
state
of
virginia.
it
was
denied
a
part
that
to
do
an
intrastate
business
in
virginia
because
of
this
provision
of
the
constitution
as
i've
read
and
the
virginia
freighters
were
affirmed
by
this
court
in
reaching
that
decision.
now
in
consequence,
as
this
court
said
on
a
prior
appeal
--
it's
just
the
word
--
as
a
consequence
of
the
state's
own
policy,
this
appellate
does
no
business
in
virginia,
which
a
state
has
the
power
to
prohibit,
but
thus
holds
as
such
as
it
can
conduct
on
the
protection
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
(inaudible)
state
express
falls
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
control,
a
separate
virginia
subsidiary
necessarily
was
organized.
so
the
virginia
company,
the
railway
express
agency
company
of
virginia
was
organized
and
the
record
shows
that
under
a
stipulation
that's
--
from
that
time
until
now
the
virginia
company
has
done
wholly
on
intrastate
business
in
virginia
and
the
appellant
has
done
solely
on
interstate
business
in
virginia.
the
virginia
company
has
paid
all
of
its
profit
taxes
without
complaint.
it
paid
the
prior
license
tax;
and
it
has
paid
this
franchise
tax
based
on
its
gross
receipts
derived
from
intrastate
commerce.
the
appellate
here
has
paid
all
of
its
property
taxes
from
the
time
it
came
down
until
the
present
year;
it
paid
a
prior
license
tax
on
the
protest
until
this
court
decided
the
spector
motor
company
case
when
it
filed
a
petition
for
correction.
and
it
has
been
almost
successful
in
that
appeal.
it
has
not
to
pay
it.
thus
it
has
paid
the
present
franchise
tax
which
was
the
first
year,
1956,
after
legislature
passed
this
new
act.
it
paid
it
under
protest,
and
filed
a
petition
with
the
commission
for
it's
correction
on
the
ground,
as
i've
said,
that
it
was
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
and
that
was
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
its
not
--
not
enforced
as
a
law.
the
commission
and
the
virginia
court
held
that
property
--
the
tax
to
be
a
property
tax
and
this
is
--
this
is
the
meat
of
the
case,
upon
the
going
concern
or
goodwill
value
of
the
business.
now
that
is
the
property
that
it
has
--
it
has
sought
to
be
taxed.
so
that
--
so
that
was,
i
think
it
was,
that
was
what
the
virginia
court
had
held
in
the
prior
case
under
the
license
tax
statute.
and
this
court
reversed
that
holding
that
this
statute
was
--
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
was
not
a
property
tax,
but
a
privilege
tax,
or
the
virginia
court
had
held
it
to
be
such
on
a
so-called
“system
or
scheme”
of
allocating
values
for
taxation
of
state
and
local
purposes.
then
the
virginia
legislature
passed
this
1956
act
which
i
have
read
to
the
court.
now
a
further
statute,
mr.
justice
douglas,
let
these
three
changes.
it
changed
the
need
from
a
franchise
--
from
a
privilege
to
a
franchise
tax
but
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
labels
don't
control
its
judgment.
the
second,
here
the
taxes
made
in
lieu
of
certain
other
property
whereas
the
old
tax
were
in
addition
to
other
property
taxes.
our
contention
is,
is
that
the
tax
--
if
a
direct
tax
on
gross
receipts
was
merely
measured
the
extent
of
the
privilege
exercised
and
does
not
determine
the
value
of
the
property
employed
in
the
business
to
produce
those
earnings.
thirdly,
the
present
tax
does
not
say
expressly
that
it's
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
but
the
important
thing
is
since
the
sole
basis
of
a
levy
is
the
fact
you
have
done
business
and
is
computed
on
the
basis
of
your
gross
receipts
for
the
prior
year,
the
absence
of
that
language
is
unimportant.
so
those
three
differences
are
the
only
differences
in
the
(inaudible)
between
the
old
tax
and
the
new
tax.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
determining
factor
in
this
court's
prior
decision
which
has
not
recognized
or
considered
or
if
it
was,
it
was
not
accepted,
the
(inaudible)
virginia
commission
or
the
virginia
court
was
that
gross
receipts
are
no
proper
measure
of
value
in
the
formal
appeal,
this
court
said,
but
the
taxing
dispute
deal
does
not
depend
on
owning
any
physical
property
nor
upon
the
value
thereon
but
would
be
levied
on
gross
revenues
even
if
it'd
come
to
find
some
way
to
dispense
with
all
local
and
physical
property.
the
fact
that
it's
measured
as
gross
revenue
is
consistent
with
the
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
a
volume
of
business
which
would
yield
that
revenue
just
as
that
legislature
indicated.
now
--
but
we
have
declined
with
your
mere
gross
receipts
as
a
sound
measure
of
going
concern
value
in
a
practical
world
of
commerce
where
value
depend
on
profitableness
of
a
business
not
merely
it's
volume
citing
the
case
of
united
states
(inaudible)
oak
creek.
we
said
that
that
is
the
nub
of
this
case.
it
was
the
principle
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
prior
decision.
it
was
ignored
by
both
the
commission
and
the
virginia
court
and
we
say
that
the
determinating
factor
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
is
a
property
or
privilege
tax.
now
it's
significant
too
that
the
virginia
commission
never
un
--
undertook
to
determine
the
value
of
this
going
concern
or
goodwill.
it
made
no
ascertainment
of
what
it
was
worth.
on
the
contrary,
as
the
formula
which
it
worked
out,
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
found
at
page
109
of
the
record,
gross
receipts
could
be
taxed
$6.5
million,
taxed
at
2.15%,
$139,000.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
yes,
the
rate
was
the
same.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
that
was
in
--
that
would
involve
the
year
1951
as
i
recall
it
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
it's
been
like
most
taxes.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
no,
the
rate
is
the
same
but
the
gross
receipts
of
what
has
affected
the
amount.
now
this
tax
as
i've
said
is
levied
in
the
direct
proportion
to
the
extent
of
which
the
virginia
commission
found
that
the
privilege
of
carrying
on
the
appellant's
business
was
exercised
in
virginia.
it
has
--
it's
done
nothing
else.
now
as
i've
said
a
moment
ago
under
the
virginia's
scheme
of
taxation
intangible
property
is
segregated
for
--
to
state
taxation.
this
return
was
made
of
intangible
property,
so
much
money,
that's
all
the
intangible
property
had.
i
digress
a
moment
to
--
to
point
out
at
what
seems
to
us
the
--
the
labored
manner
in
which
the
commission
tried
to
justify
this
tax
traditionally
and
historically
from
the
time
--
for
this
to
come
--
that
came
into
virginia.
it's
automotive
equipment,
that
is
its
trucks
that
run
around
the
streets
and
these
little
dolly
trucks
in
the
stations
have
been
taxed
as
tangible
personal
property.
and
their
value
is
certified
to
the
local
authorities
as
--
as
a
basis
of
a
local
property
tax.
the
rolling
stock
of
this
company
had
been
so
infrequent
in
virginia.
and
at
--
on
the
mileage
basis,
the
taxes
for
the
years
up
to
1950
had
been
so
negligible
that
after
that
the
commission,
there
were
assessments.
if
you
had
assessed
them
in
--
in
1956
on
the
same
basis
you've
had
an
assessment
before,
it
would
have
been
about
$200
and
some
dollars
as
i
recall
it.
but
the
commission
said,
“no
longer
do
we
regard
this
automotive
equipment
and
these
little
dolly
trucks
as
tangible
personal
property.
we're
going
to
call
them
rolling
stock.
now,
everything
that
moves
on
wheels,
the
commission
said
is
rolling
stock.
so
they
increased
the
value
of
the
property
in
lieu
of
which,
this
tax
is
imposed
and
then
i
would
deal
with
that
point
in
a
moment.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
oh
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
every
--
every
taxing
jurisdiction
in
the
state,
county
or
city
more
or
less
have
a
different
rate.
and
the
state
corporation
commission,
i
think
i
anticipate
on
what
you
have
in
mind,
the
state
corporation
commission
is
the
assessing
body
for
all
forms
of
property
of
public
service
corporations.
it
merely
determines
the
value
of
the
intangible
property
and
real
estate
and
certifies
it
to
the
local
taxing
authorities.
it
certifies
the
amount
of
intangible
property,
securities,
tax
and
certifies
it
to
the
state
treasurer
for
collection
for
state
tax.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
i
don't
believe
so
if
your
honor
please,
there
has
been
traditionally
but
in
the
commission
an
accepted
formula
whereby
it
tries
to
equalize
a
tangible
and
real
estate
values
throughout
the
state
on
a
40%
ratio.
and
to
that
extent,
public
service
corporations
on
--
it
maybe
said,
are
not
taxed
at
a
100%
of
their
tangible
and
across
property
in
real
estate
values.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
but
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
intangibles
are
assessed
at
their
full
value
and
so
certified
for
state
taxation.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
i
would
say
as
to
intangible,
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
i
will
go
to
enumerate
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
i'll
give
it
to
you
fully
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
it
had
no
intangible
property
except
money.
it
had
no
rolling
stock
within
the
constitutional
law
or
statutory
sense
that
the
commission
had
ever
assessed
that
such
part
are
here
because
it
had
treated
it
as
--
as
tangible
personal
property
and
allocate
it
for
local
assessment.
so
the
commission
and
the
court
took
this
approach
to
the
case.
they
said,
“this
appellant
has
these
exclusive
express
privileges
under
their
contracts
to
the
railroads.
it's
a
nice
little
monopoly
--
monopoly”
and
therefore
these
contracts
certainly
held
--
goodwill
or
going
concern
value.
well
let's
assume
that
could
be
a
fact
which
it
isn't
that
value
has
been
determined
to
be
$6.5
million
in
virginia
which
happens
to
be
the
exact
with
the
gross
receipts
of
this
company.
now
to
put
it
in
another
way,
if
virginia
gross
receipts
of
$6.5
million
establishes
an
equal
dollar
amount
of
goodwill
value
for
tax
purposes
in
virginia,
then
appellant's
total
gross
receipts
of
$387,500,000
establishes
that,
it
has
a
system
goodwill
value
over
an
amount,
equal
to
that
of
$387
million.
that
there
in
determining
goodwill
value
implies
that
every
dollar
earned
is
a
dollar
made
regardless
of
the
cost
of
earning
that
dollar.
well
now
that
is
just
not
realistic
in
the
--
in
the
modern
concept
of
our
economy
and
that
is
the
whole
case.
that's
the
whole
basis
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
i
said
gross
receipts
if
--
if
what
the
commission
determined
to
be
the
gross
receipts
derived
by
this
company
from
purely
interstate
commerce
of
$6.5
million
established
an
equal
dollar
amount
of
goodwill
value
for
purpose
of
taxation
in
virginia
and
that's
what
it
did
because
they
took
exactly
the
amount
of
the
gross
receipts
and
considered
that
to
be
the
goodwill
value,
then
appellant's
total
gross
receipts
from
its
system
operation
which
is
$387,500,000
must
demonstrate
that
this
company
has
a
--
a
national
goodwill
value,
close
to
$387
million
or
in
other
words,
to
reduce
it
a
little
more
simply,
every
dollar
earned
is
a
dollar
made
regardless
of
what
the
cost
maybe
of
earning
that
dollar.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
that
is
true
your
honor
but
i
--
i'm
only
applying
the
formula
which
the
state
of
virginia
uses
and
if
it
can
be
applied
logically
to
virginia,
it
can
be
applied
logically
every
--
elsewhere.
now
let
me
deal
with
the
--
the
subject
matter
of
this
--
of
this
so
called
goodwill.
that
is
these
express
contracts
with
the
railroads.
the
important
part
of
it
is
printed
in
the
record.
it
shows
that
after
its
operating
expenses,
maintenance
and
--
and
what
taxes
it
has
to
pay,
all
of
the
income
of
this
company
are
paid
over
to
its
owners,
railways
or
the
various
railroads
in
the
united
states.
so
the
company
has
no
net
income
in
the
--
in
the
taxable
or
practical
concept
of
that
term.
well
if
it
has
no
net
income
as
a
--
what's
said
in
the
case
of
southern
railway
company
v.
against
kentucky,
274
u.s.
if
taken
separately,
it
is
clear
talking
about
this
so-called
property
value
arising
from
use,
if
taken
separately,
it
is
clear
that
the
cause
of
lack
of
net
earnings,
no
substantial
and
tangible
elements
of
value
could
be
reasonably
be
attributed
to
the
railroad
of
that
company.
and
that's
the
case
on
the
question
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
we
submit
that
the
use
of
gross
receipts
as
an
effort
to
determine
property
value
reflected
by
going
concern
or
goodwill
value
establishes
the
tax
as
a
privilege
rather
than
a
property
tax
and
it
can't
be
--
it
can't
be
practically
applied
any
other
way.
now
come
to
--
i
have
to
briefly
deal
with
the
question
involved
with
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
right
now
--
right
now
if
your
honor,
please.
this
company's
return
showed
it
had
a
$120,000
in
cash
on
a
taxable
date.
let
me
--
maybe
your
honor
would
like
to
see
that
written
rather
than
stated.
it
is
set
out
fully
in
our
brief.
well,
i'll
state
it.
it
has
a
$120,000
of
cash.
it
had
a
rolling
stock
in
its
true
sense
which
if
taxed
at
the
prior
--
on
the
prior
method
would
have
yielded
a
tax
of
over
--
that
would
be
$27.
the
50
cent
tax
on
a
$120,000
would
have
yielded
$252.
now
if
you
add
to
that
the
automotive
equipment
and
little
dolly
trucks
which
the
commission
had
traditionally
have
assessed
as
tangible
property
subject
to
local
taxation
but
reclassified
by
it
for
the
premise
of
this
case
as
rolling
stock
and
therefore
a
subject
of
estate
taxation,
you
would
add
a
value
of
$262,719.63
which
at
this
tax
toll
rate
of
250
would
have
yielded
a
tax
of
$6567.99
or
a
total
tax
of
$7,247.76;
now
that
does
not
take
into
account,
as
i
have
said,
the
so
called
goodwill
value,
arising
out
of
the
existence
of
these
contracts
for
the
railroads.
the
total
profit
of
tangible
and
the
intangible,
office
furniture,
real
estate
intent
for
the
way
of
money
was
$456,565.
now,
it's
obvious
that
a
tax
of
$140,000
on
actual
computed
values
of
$456,000
is
about
a
33%
tax
on
the
product.
so
where
--
where
does
the
--
all
the
justification
come
from?
it
comes
from
and
only
from
this
so
called
goodwill
value.
as
i've
said
the
commission
has
never
found
what
that
value
was.
but
if
we
know
what
the
tax
is
its
$120,000,
we
know
what
the
rate
of
taxation
of
intangible,
or
personal
property.
it
is
50
cents
on
$100
of
value.
so
if
you
apply
the
rate
to
the
actual
tax
we
will
have
to
have
a
goodwill
value
of
$27,947,000
to
justify
this
tax.
now
we
said
that
under
the
in
lieu
provisions
of
the
tax
if
your
honors
please
that
the
tax
must
fall
because
it
is
not
in
an
amount
which
would
have
been
legitimate
to
impose
all
the
property
in
lieu
of
which
it
is
imposed.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
it's
exactly
the
same
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
that's
what
--
that's
what
they
put
on
it.
but
i
have
tried
to
demonstrate
a
moment
ago
that's
a
fallacious
--
that's
a
fallacious
assumption
because
it
would
mean
every
dollar
earned
was
a
dollar
gained
without
any
account
for
the
cost
to
earning
that
dollar
and
said
that
no
goodwill
can
arrive
until
you
had
something
profitable
up
--
for
your
operation.
but
i'm
going
a
step
further
now
and
showing
that
if
the
commission
had
found
some
value
distinct
and
so
stated
to
be
for
this
goodwill
or
going
concern
it
didn't
do
it
but
if
it
had
done
so
it
will
have
--
have
to
amount
to
$27,947,000
because
by
applying
the
50
cents
to
a
hundred
tax
rate
to
the
tax
of
$140,000
that
--
that
is
the
amount
of
property
you
would
have
to
add
to
(inaudible).
now
it
comes
to
all
your
great
deal
in
that
brief,
that's
a
false
tax
rate.
there's
nothing
false
about
it
at
all.
it's
what
the
--
what
the
state
has
imposed
on
all
the
intangible
or
personal
property,
50
cents.
and
it's
what
should
be
applied
here
if
you
would
work
out
an
analogy
to
determine
what
value
the
commission
really
attributed
to
this
going
concern.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
i
didn't
say
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
that's
not
implicit
in
my
argument
either.
i
was
--
i
was
just
saying
that
from
the
standpoint
expediency
i
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
state
of
virginia
would
impose
a
33%
tax.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
it
certainly
would
have
to
have
some
basis
of
property
upon
which
to
impose
a
tax.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
what
i
said
was
that
the
tax
of
$120,000
how
could
it
be
33
and
1/3
%
of
the
physical
value
of
property
of
the
state?
that's
all.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
unless
you
want
it.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well,
the
--
you
would
--
if
--
if
the
state
found
itself
to
impose
a
tax
of
33
and
1/3
%
it
would
be
confined
to
a
physical
values.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
now
--
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well
that
wasn't
my
statement,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
that's
perfect.
the
assessed
tangible
is
localized,
but
intangible
you
go
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
so
i
was
trying
to
make
the
court
to
ask
your
honor
please
that
the
taxes
--
the
credibility
that
anyone
feels
--
that's
--
that
this
$140,000
tax
is
made
up
by
physical
value
in
--
in
a
rationale
of
this
case
and
the
only
way
that
you
can
assume
that
it
was
trying
to
reach
the
intangible
value
which
a
state
has
filed
a
tax
is
to
find
some
sum
which
the
commission
didn't
determine
to
represent
this
goodwill
value.
and
i
said
to
--
to
determine
that
you
should
apply
the
rate
of
50
cents
to
$100
to
the
tax
of
a
$140,000
and
you
get
this
$27.5
million
of
value.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
well,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
for
this
reason.
as
an
in
lieu
--
in
lieu
--
as
an
in
lieu
tax
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
property,
the
tax
fee
yielded
by
the
processor
to
employ,
call
it
the
franchise
or
any
other
competition,
if
that
--
that
tax
is
in
lieu
of
a
property
tax
it
must
not
be
greater
in
amount
then
would
be
legitimate
directly
taxed
on
the
profit
so
imposed.
now
your
honor
puts
to
me
the
question,
would
--
could
virginia
legitimately
tax
all
the
intangible
values
and
tangible
values
at
33%,
my
answer
of
course
is
yes.
of
course
it
has
the
constitutional
power
to
do
that,
but
it
hasn't
done
that
your
honor,
please
and
that's
not
the
test
before
the
court
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve
mr.
chief
justice
what
time
i
have
left.
mr.
thomas
b.
gay
if
your
honor
please,
just
a
few
words.
we
have
been
summarizing
our
position
as
this.
the
spector
motor
case
laid
down
in
a
clear
and
definitive
way,
and
i
last
said
to
have
adopted
a
phrase
that
has
--
had
quite
reasons
of
significance,
had
been
accepted
as
the
law
of
the
land
in
12
states
as
controlling
on
the
principle
that
gross
receipts
or
--
or
net
income
however
fairly
apportioned
and
however
non-discriminatory
may
not
be
imposed
on
either
gross
or
net
income
from
a
corporation
engaged
solely
in
the
interstate
commerce.
now,
that's
the
--
that's
the
--
they're
not
in
the
shell
of
spector
motor
case.
and
we
rely
on
that
for
our
premise
and
that
is
that
if,
and
it
is
a
lot
of
talk
these
briefs
but
the
stipulation
set
me
--
there,
the
record
sustained
that
this
corporation
is
engaged
solely
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
this
tax
is
solely
on
gross
receipts
derived
from
interstate
commerce.
now,
while
it'd
be
fairly
apportioned
or
whether
be
non-discriminatory,
under
the
spector
motor
case,
it's
invalid
if
it's
a
tax
on
the
gross
receipts.
now,
therefore,
we
–
and
--
and
it's
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
argued,
it
is
a
tax
on
gross
receipts
and
nothing
else.
if
it
however
be
considered
to
be
property
tax,
then
this
--
we
rely
on
what
this
court
said
in
the
prior
appeal
in
this
case
in
which
was
considered
--
we
have
said
but
we
have
declined
for
a
judge
mere
gross
receipts
of
the
sound
measure
of
going
concern
value
in
a
practical
world
of
commerce
where
value
is
obtained
on
profits
of
a
business
and
not
as
mere
volume.
now,
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
they
have
filed
the
measure,
this
intangible
or
so-called
“goodwill
value
by
gross
receipts”.
and
the
court
meant
what
it
said
in
that
case,
in
we
certainly
feel
it
did.
that's
not
a
proper
measure
of
value
to
determine
the
value
of
property.
now,
we
don't
question
the
power
of
the
state
to
tax
all
property
of
a
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
where
it'd
be
tangible
or
intangible.
it
has
taxed
all
the
tangible
property
and
the
taxes
have
been
paid.
it's
seeks
to
reach
this
in
quitting
this
goodwill
value
by
measurement
by
gross
receipts.
well,
now,
if
it
--
what
does
this
court
said
in
the
prior
appeal
in
this
case
is
sound
long,
we
accept
it
--
believe
it
could
be,
then
you
can't
use
that
measure
of
determining
goodwill
value.
and
that's
this
whole
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
