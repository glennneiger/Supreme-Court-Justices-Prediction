justice
charles
e.
whittaker
where
did
they
did
seek
to
(inaudible)
that
the
income
for
the
same
amount
that
the
goodwill
value
assessed
by
virginia
was
the
same
amount
as
it
was
supposed
to
be?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
not
only
$6,000,000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
immediately
it's
available
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
don't
intend
that
--
not
the
fact
if
the
some
fraction
were
introduced
of
the
local
business
by
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
what
we
have
is
the
question
whether
or
not
you
may
levy
this
tax
on
interstate.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
did
--
mr.
gray,
what
did
you
say
in
respect
to
this?
you'd
have
to
take
the
contract,
if
at
all,
in
whole
with
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
contract
contains
a
covenant
with
all
of
the
avails,
the
same
operating
cost
that
would
be
paid
over
to
somebody
else.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
so
the
contract
would
have
no
value,
would
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
would
they
pay
to
get
rid
of
that
covenant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that's
exactly
what
measures
the
value
of
the
contract
to
the
railroad.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
contract
as
it
extends
now
is
it
worth
it
--
would
it
worth
a
dime
to
--
to
amass
the
meaning
of
express
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
but
the
contract
is
this
thing
that
contains
the
covenant
that
binds
you
to
pay
out
all
their
debt.
now
what
about
the
value
of
the
contract
which
is
what
you
say
you
were
going
to
tax?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
does
the
--
in
matter
of
law
have
no
value?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
i
don't
see
how
they
cannot
keep
anything
like
this.
it's
what
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
value
to
the
railways.
but
what
would
it
do
to
the
express
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
they
taxed
it
which
is
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
this
income?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
they
didn't
have
to
call
for
an
income
they
--
part
of
their
income
is
the
income
they
get
from
the
express
company
out
of
the
contract,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
if
it
could
be,
you
still
have
to
point,
is
it
not,
mr.
gray,
in
some
property
is
subject
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
the
tax.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
there'd
be
no
amount
involved
if
the
record
affirmatively
showed
there
was
no
property.
