justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
were
not
a
virginia-licensed
corporation
and
you
were
not
required
to
be
licensed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
inhibited
from
being
licensed
to
do
business
unless
you
were
licensed
and
that's
why
i
asked
whether
you
never
did
--
you
never
compelled
to
be
licensed
in
order
to
do
what
you
did
do,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
stood
there
on
your
own
delaware
charges
was
moved
in
--
to
the
outside
of
delaware.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gay,
would
it
disturb
your
old
order
of
argument
if
you
told
it
at
the
outset,
since
this
is
an
in
lieu
tax
--
this
is
an
in
lieu
tax,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
denominated.
what
taxes,
in
your
view,
the
state
of
virginia
or
the
commonwealth,
if
i
may
say
so
of
virginia,
could
have
imposed
on
property
or
what
--
what
taxes
the
state,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
could
have
imposed
on
you
for
which
this
is
in
lieu?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
and
not
--
not
under
your
constitution
because
that's
the
question
for
your
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
from
your
point
of
view,
and
since
this
is
in
lieu
statute
of
tax
of
--
of
what
allowable
under
the
federal
constitution,
what
allowable
tax
could
virginia
impose
for
which
this
tax
is
in
lieu
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
bank
account
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
ask
whether
in
view
of
these
56
statutes,
virginia
no
longer
taxes
receivables
or
rolling
stock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
want
to
go
into
argument.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
taxes
are
in
virginia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
rate
of
--
the
local
rate
of
taxation
for
tangibles
and
the
state
taxation
for
intangibles
are
varying
rates
in
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
the
base
--
is
the
base
of
taxation
--
is
the
gamut
considerable
mr.
gay?
i
mean,
did
a
100%
value
or
80%
or
10%,
could
it
vary?
could
by
changing
the
base
the
amount
of
the
tax
vary
considerably?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
believe
from
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court,
in
other
states
and
yours,
utility
tangible
was
taxed
at
a
higher
--
on
a
higher
basis
than
non-utility
tax.
specifically,
we
had
a
case
from
tennessee
as
you
probably
know,
the
browning
case
where
that
very
question
came
up
whether
a
--
a
higher
base
of
taxation
of
the
railroad
companies
as
against
the
general
property
tax
of
the
state
and
that
at
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
that
again?
what
you
think
is
the
whole
basis
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
all
depends
on
the
basis
on
which
other
taxing
authorities
may
assess
goodwill
and
we
know
that
that
isn't
so,
that
it
varies
from
state
to
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gay,
do
i
infer
correctly
the
records
if
i
do
not
but
implied
in
your
argument
is
the
suggestion
that
state
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
could
not
impose
the
33%
tax
on
intangibles
and
intangibles
within
virginia
except
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
didn't
say
that
but
is
that
implied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
it
constitutionally
could
then
would
you
please
tell
me
why
i
couldn't
say
you
will
help
me
constitutionally
can
do
we're
doing
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
they
have
property
worth
more
than
$65,000
and
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
obtain
the
dollar
tax
that
is
left
it
is
hinged
on
tangible
and
intangible
tax
rate.
it
would
have
to
accept
the
33%
tax,
or
did
i
misunderstand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
my
question
is
whether
the
federal
constitution
apart
or
--
or
it
could
not
assess
such
a
tax
except
by
appending
the
federal
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
would
though.
it's
just
--
i'm
asking
because
my
problem
and
i
want
to
put
it
to
you
is
--
my
problem
is
this.
if
virginia
could
impose
a
tax,
not
that
it
did,
but
that
it
could
constitutionally
without
running
afoul
to
the
united
states
constitution,
if
it
could
impose
such
a
tax
then
what
in
united
states
constitution
barred
it
from
--
for
imposing
an
in
lieu
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
physical
and
in
--
and
intangible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
said
that
--
that
under
your
law,
the
taxation
law,
they
may
tax
intangible
so
called
localized
in
virginia,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
court
insofar
as
the
united
states
constitution
is
concerned,
both
to
commerce
clause
and
the
due
process
clause,
a
state
may
do
something
that
is
very
unwise
and
it
could
plead
a
similar
presence
so
far
that
we
go
over
the
bounds
of
the
federal
constitution,
that
is
correct,
mr.
gay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i'm
asking
you
is
this,
suppose
the
legislature
of
virginia
says
and
it
recites,
“we
are
free
to
impose
a
tax
up
to
33%
of
all
values,
tangible
and
intangible,
of
this
corporation
doing
business
with
virginia.
we
choose
not
to
do
it
that
way.
we
think
it's
a
fair
way
to
assess
the
power
that
we
could
exercise
by
letting
our
corporation
commission
to
determine
what
the
goodwill
of
this
company
is.”
suppose
they
said
that,
would
that
be
the
same
case
as
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
to
drop
you
down
to
scale,
does
that
mean
that
if
--
if
this
should
be
--
if
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
your
court,
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
tax
or
that
is
foreclosed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
it
wasn't
an
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
contested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
they
challenge
the
basis
on
which
you
computed
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
talking
how
numerically
so
excessive
but
the
basis
on
which
it
was
reached.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
in
lieu,
the
professed
in
lieuness
have
to
have
any
rational
relation
to
what
it
is
in
lieu
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
--
without
being
astronomical
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
is
the
situation
as
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
standing
--
are
you
saying
in
effect
what
mr.
justice
harlan
put
to
you
namely
that
the
express
company
is
not
a
–
an
empty
conduit
for
its
income
to
the
railroads
if
you're
going
to
treat
the
railway
express
constitutionally
as
it
coerced
person
within
--
within
virginia,
it's
coerce
that
should
be
deemed
as
a
separate
entity
from
--
from
the
alternate
receiver
for
the
purpose
of
the
income
that
it
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
virginia
was
constitutionally
authorized
as
it
were
--
was
by
the
decision
in
282
to
compel
the
local
railway
express
company
from
coming
into
being,
and
from
the
part
of
your
virginia
in
constitutional
law,
it
has
held
the
same
thing.
you
don't
have
to
bother
about
where
the
money
is
going
eventually.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
not
--
but
that's
not
important
(inaudible)
in
fact
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
they
don't
--
they
can
do
business
and
that
they
have
right
to
do
business,
it
hasn't
forfeited.
that
is
not
very
important
otherwise
in
easy
way
to
put
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
way
around,
it's
very
important.
if
the
state
tells
us,
"we
want
a
license,
you
can
do
business,
that's
very
important."
avoid
using
the
label
is
not
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
tax
public
utility
differently
from
ordinary
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
take
a
--
take
a
--
state
for
your
--
any
of
the
other
(inaudible)
is
a
store
at
richmond
or
in
orleans,
are
they
taxed
the
same
way
that
the
office
of
the
--
of
the
railway
express
company
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
concern
or
that
they
--
have
they
got
offices?
have
they
got
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
offices
in
different
cities
of
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
difference
in
taxation
between
property,
physical
property
of
the
grocery
business
and
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
electric
--
a
local
gas
or
electric
or
water
company
whatnot
utility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
the
grocery
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
is
the
local
business
of
a
--
once
a
telephone
company
that
says
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
speaking
to
(inaudible)
is
the
intrastate
telephone
business,
just
as
you
told
it,
taxed
the
way
this
company
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
follow.
it
isn't
reachable
by
some
other
taxing
measure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gray,
i
noticed
that
we
--
i'm
sure
about
--
i
noticed
that
you
--
you
or
mr.
gay
referred
to
a
case
that
has
always
given
need
more
light
in
any
other
single
case
on
this
subject,
galveston-texas
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i've
looked
at
the
(inaudible)
i'm
not
--
people
have
different
views
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
want
to
ask
you
--
that
isn't
--
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
just
note
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
wondered
if
you
address
yourself
to
the
remark
made
by
justice
holmes
in
that
opinion.
as
a
generality,
it
doesn't
help
me
decide
any
one
of
these
cases
but
it
(inaudible)
argue,
he
said
that
for
the
court,
if
it
attached
right
this
on
the
railroad
or
what
do
you
call
the
organic
value
of
the
property,
if
it
bares
upon
commerce
among
the
state,
first
by
presenting
the
whole
(inaudible)
taxation
that
must
be
taken
into
account.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
--
i
am
impressing
mr.
gay
as
much
as
i
have
and
you
are
part
of
the
other
kinds
of
(inaudible)
they
could
levy.
if
it
is
upon
commerce
among
the
state
so
directly
as
to
amount
to
a
regulation
in
a
relatively
immediate
way,
in
a
relatively
immediate
way,
it
will
not
be
saved
by
name
or
(inaudible)
now,
your
gaps,
so
far
as
i'm
concern,
is
to
prove
that
this
had
been
so
far
as
my
(inaudible)
about
this
concern
that
this
is
not
amount
to
a
regulation
in
a
relatively
immediate
way
by
an
indirection,
when
you've
been
denied
to
do
it
directly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
put
the
question
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
forecasting
my
--
because
i
--
i
couldn't.
i
don't
know
what
else
is
about
(inaudible)

i
don't
think
that
the
court
would
decide
against
you

fold
your

decide
the

that
they
can't
do
anything

you?
