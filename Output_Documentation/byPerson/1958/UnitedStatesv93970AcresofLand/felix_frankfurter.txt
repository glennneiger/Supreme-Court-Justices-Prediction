justice

just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
spritzer,
can
the
government
begin
condemnation
proceedings,
government
of
the
united
states,
in
a
state
court
of
the
(inaudible)
it's
not
relevant,
i'm
just
curious.
and
it
might
be
that
if
they
sought
the
illinois
courts
for
that
purpose,
they
would
have
to
go
through
their
equal
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
they
--
their
jurisdiction
couldn't
be
extended
because
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
scores
of
such
oversights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
subsequently
corrected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
would
have
to
determine
this
originally,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
your
position
that
in
this
situation,
there's
no
reason
why
we
should
not
determine
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
skepticism
about
congressional
legislation
isn't
restricted
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
have
a
hole
in
it
but
you
could
prove
that
the
hole
made
it
relatively
worthless?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
suggestion
that
be
included
of
the
secretary
of
war
diluted
the
secretary
of
the
navy
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
only
question
in
the
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
was
your
declaratory
judgments
dismissed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
there
was
no
declaratory
judgment
mode
of
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
because
of
a
summary
way,
you
tried
to
give
consent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
everyday
common
matter.
that's
the
kind
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so-called
unfairness,
it
always
exist
against
the
civil
and
--
and
the
other
controversies
of
government
except
that
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
under
the
proper
act
into
the
various
district
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
division
--
the
division
by
transition
of
the
illinois
law
in
an
eminent
domain
proceeding,
if
illinois
laws
mode
of
dealing
with
the
procedural
problems
arising
out
of
condemnation.
as
i
understand
it,
unless
you
correct
me.
as
i
understand
it
under
illinois
law,
you
first
go
in
to
ascertain
the
respective
interest
in
the
property,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
you
take
the
government
--
can't
you
at
all
determine
the
interest
in
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
foreclosed
under
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
i
didn't
say
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
preceeding
in
the
condemnation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
under
the
illinois
law,
you
take
two
(inaudible)
you
first
determine
what
the
property
interests
are
having
ascertained
what
they
are,
you
don't
need
to
go
in
and
condemn
what
you
want
to
condemn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
illinois'
laws
of
dealing
with
the
condemnation
proceeding
by
taking
two
steps,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
71
you
place
a
condemnation
rule,
it's
a
federal
rule
but
didn't
have
to
cover
the
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
it
must
be
engrafted
on
to
the
illinois
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
away
the
labor
to
adopt
it
to
election
of
remedy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
law
has
one
procedure,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
we
should
mean
to
take
away
the
label.
justice
felix
frankfurter
illinois
has
two
steps
for
condemning
--
in
resolving
the
condemnation
of
property,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
if
the
state
want
to
condemn
a
lease
hold
interest,
it
first
ascertain
who
has
the
lease
hold
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
that's
what
i
call
the
first
step.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
after
that
passing
in,
it
goes
ahead
and
sit
down
on
the
to
condemnor's
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
illinois'
way
of
doing
it,
is
that
right?
the
federal
rules'
way
of
doing
it
is
something
else.
suppose
there
was
no
illinois
statute,
could
you
determine
interest
in
property
as
well
as
the
right
to
condemn
in
the
same
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
illinois'
common
law,
illinois'
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
forget.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
were
in
wyoming?
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably,
wyoming
has
a
different
set
of
law
or
massachusetts
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
somebody
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
supposed
wyoming
has
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
saying
that
despite
the
doctrine
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
if
we
look
today,
not
only
among
the
rules
but
in
the
rules
committee
but
in
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
our
conference
on
this
question,
and
after
this
court
adopted
it
and
promulgated
and
congress
then
set
it
aside.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
there
would
still,
as
of
those
--
as
of
that
be
really
48
different
ways
to
condemning
government
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
no
longer
the
law
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
been
changed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
it's
caught
up
in
a
lot
of
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
just
for
the
purpose
of
my
next
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assume
that
it's
no
longer
the
law
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
it
isn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
it
wasn't
inadvertently,
it
wasn't
meant
to
be
continued
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
it
was
unconstitutional
for
congress
later
to
say
retroactive.
we
wipe
this
out
into
the
pure
inadvertent,
has
happened
when
the
revised
statutes
were
promulgated
in
75
and
78
and
when
this
court
has
promulgated
in
the
way
in
which
it
was
not
by
scientifically,
retroactive
then
you
wipe
it
out
because
it
was
never
meant
to
be
there,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
position
is
then
that
today,
50
or
the
assumedly
50
--
formally
50
states
that
the
government's
power
of
condemnation
to
--
to
the
58
states
to
turn
down
the
procedure
of
each
one
of
those
50
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
congress
couldn't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wiped
that
out
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
they
didn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
case
has
been
going
through
the
courts?
and
perhaps
since
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
interest
in
the
length
of
this
for
today.
