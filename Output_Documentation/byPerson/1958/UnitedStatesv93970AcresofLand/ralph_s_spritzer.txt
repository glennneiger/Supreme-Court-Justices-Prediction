mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
is
a
condemnation
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit.
without
attempting
to
state
the
facts
in
detail,
let
me
sketch
them
very
briefly
in
order
to
provide
some
background
for
a
statement
of
the
two
questions
which
the
case
presents.
the
land
involved
some
90
acres
located
on
the
outskirts
of
chicago,
was
used
as
a
naval
airfield
during
world
war
ii.
after
the
wars,
the
court
knows,
much
government
property
was
disposed
of
as
surplus.
certain
property,
however,
was
leased
rather
than
sold.
this
was
done
and
done
pursuant
to
statutory
authorization.
when
it
was
believed
that
property
not
immediately
or
contemporaneously
required
for
public
use
should
be
retained
in
stand-by
status
because
of
the
possibility
or
the
likelihood
that
it
might
be
desirable
or
necessary
to
reactivate
the
facility
at
a
later
date.
this
was
such
a
case.
and
the
airfield
in
question
was
leased
accordingly
in
1947
for
a
five-year
term
with
an
option
to
renew
to
the
respondent
here,
the
illinois
aircraft
company
which
proposed
to
operate
a
flying
school
at
the
field.
the
field
under
the
lease
was
to
be
maintained
according
to
certain
specifications.
and
the
lease
was
revocable
by
the
government
on
conditions
to
which
i
shall
refer
more
specifically
later
on
60-day
notice.
respondent
also
could
terminate
on
such
notice.
some
seven
years
later,
in
july
of
1954,
when
the
lease
as
then
renewed
for
a
second
term
had
about
three
years
to
run,
the
government
delivered
a
notice
of
revocation.
this
notice
as
the
note
itself
recited
had
been
prompted
by
a
military
decision
that
the
deal
should
be
used
as
a
nike
missile
base.
respondent
at
this
point
took
the
position
that
the
notice
of
revocation
was
invalid
contending
that
the
use
planned
by
the
government
was
not
the
kind
of
use
contemplated
by
the
revocation
provision
in
the
lease.
in
respondent's
view,
the
government
was
entitled
to
revoke
only
if
it
decided
to
restore
the
field
to
its
former
use
as
a
conventional
naval
airfield.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
reference
to
naval
aviation
upon
which
respondent
relies
is
in
the
preamble.
the
revocation
provision
which
is
paragraph
14
of
the
lease
uses
simply
the
word
“essential”
that
the
government
may
revoke
on
a
determination
that
it's
essential.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right,
it's
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
their
principle
reliance
so
far
as
the
provisions
of
the
language
in
the
lease
is
concerned
is
on
the
paragraph
to
which
your
honors
just
referred
which
is
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
at
record
12.
that
is
correct.
and
on
this
basis,
respondent
refused
to
turn
over
the
premises.as
a
result
of
the
insistence
by
respondent
that
it
had
a
right
to
remain,
the
government
some
several
months
after
it
sent
the
notice
of
revocation
to
it
in
october
of
1954,
instituted
a
condemnation
proceeding.
and
it
obtained
on
the
same
day
that
it
filed
its
condemnation
complaint
and
order
for
delivery
of
possession
a
few
days
after
construction
of
the
missile
base
began.
now
the
government's
condemnation
complaint
stated
in
paragraph
4,
which
is
at
record
10,
that
the
interest
in
the
property
to
be
acquired
is
all
remaining
outstanding
right
to
title
and
interest
if
any,
of
the
illinois
company.
the
answer
asserted
and
i
refer
now
to
record
31
and
32,
reading
from
the
bottom
of
31,
“by
filing
the
complaint
in
condemnation
in
the
instant
case,
the
united
states
elected
to
pursue
a
remedy
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
the
defendant
has
no
possessory
rights
and
therefore
implicitly
recognizes
the
existence
of
a
leasehold
interest
and
is
precluded
as
a
matter
of
law
from
asserting
that
the
lease
has
been
terminated.”
the
government
proceeded
to
challenge
this
position,
this
doctrine
of
estoppel,
it
could
be
that.
both
in
a
motion
to
strike
and
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
they
were
denied.
the
case
went
on
for
trial
before
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
throughout
the
trial
accepted
the
defendant's
theory
and
ruled
throughout
the
trial
over
government
objection
that
the
government
could
make
no
reference
to
the
matter
of
cancellation,
whatever.
and
the
court
consistently,
with
that
view
charged
the
jury
that
it
must
create
the
lease
as
continuing
in
effect
and
valuate
for
the
five
remainder
rather
of
the
five-year
term.
the
court
of
appeals
with
one
judge
dissenting,
likewise
accepted
this
theory.
and
it
affirm
the
jury's
award
though
it
struck
down
as
unauthorized,
an
increase
in
that
award
which
had
been
made
by
the
trial
judge
on
his
own,
that
point
is
--
is
not
here.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
government
had
made
an
election
of
remedies,
that
is
to
say
proceeding
by
way
of
condemnation
rather
than
by
bringing
a
preliminary
suit
in
ejectment
or
to
try
title.
and
that
it
was
thereby
estopped
from
denying
that
respondent
had
the
property
interest
which
it
claimed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
court
said
as
soon
as
the
government
elected
to
proceed
by
way
of
condemnation,
it
forced
war
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
any
opportunity
to
say
that
the
respondent
did
not
have
a
subsisting
leasehold
interest
in
the
property.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
to
the
end
of
the
term,
yes,
indeed.
and
the
court
said
that
this
was
so
whether
federal
or
state
law
applies.
as
perhaps,
my
statement
already
indicates
the
first
question
which
we
raised
and
we
think
the
more
important
question
is
whether
the
government
by
bringing
an
action
in
condemnation,
which
is
of
course
an
in
rem
proceeding,
thereby
admits
that
they
are
valid
outstanding
interests
as
claimed
by
the
private
parties.
and
it
is
our
position
in
a
word
that
the
district
court
proceeding
in
a
condemnation
case
must
determine
a
dispute
existing
two
matters.
first,
the
nature
and
the
scope
of
the
outstanding
interests
and
having
established
that,
their
worth.
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling,
as
we
see
it,
has
no
support
in
any
decided
federal
case
and
it
is
also
a
ruling
which
it
seems
to
us
has
far-reaching
implications.
in
varying
many
condemnation
cases,
the
government
does
not
know
the
identity
of
all
of
the
interested
parties
and
certainly
does
not
know
what
the
scope
of
the
interest
to
the
various
private
parties
may
be.
now,
this
occurs
most
often,
of
course,
where
there
are
competing
private
claims
to
the
same
property.
but
it
may
also
occur,
as
it
does
here,
where
the
dispute
over
right
or
title
is
between
the
government
and
the
private
claimant.
and
we
simply
urge
that
the
government
forfeits
no
right
by
undertaking
to
condemn
such
interest
as
may
be
outstanding.
let
me
state
briefly
the
second
question,
the
question
as
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
perhaps
failed
to
make
a
full
disposition
because
of
its
ruling
on
the
first
issue.
and
that
is
simply
whether
the
government's
revocation
here
was
a
valid
revocation.
we
argue
that
so
far
as
the
lease
is
concerned,
it
conferred
a
right
to
revoke
whatever
the
precise
nature
of
the
military
need
and
that
it's
immaterial
whether
the
lease
was
revoked
in
order
to
operate
a
navy
base
or
an
army
base
in
order
to
service
manned
aircraft
or
unmanned
missiles.
but
more
fundamentally,
we
rely
as
to
this
point
on
the
proposition
that
an
act
of
congress,
the
very
military
leasing
statute
under
which
this
lease
was
authorized
and
executed
in
terms
provided
that
such
leases
are
to
be
revocable
at
any
time.
i
shall
return
later
to
this
revocation
point,
but
i'd
like
to
get
on
first
with
the
broader
issue
which
involves
the
nature
and
the
scope
of
condemnation,
the
issue
whether
the
government
could
assert
its
right
to
the
property
or
respondent's
lack
of
right
in
resistance
to
respondent's
claim
for
just
compensation.
now,
the
court
below
has
said
that
the
government
had
an
election.
we
say
that
the
--
that
the
decision
below
really
gives
us
a
hobson's
choice
because
assuming
that
the
revocation
was
valid,
assuming
that,
the
government,
according
to
the
courts
below,
had
a
choice,
one,
of
paying
for
that
which
already
belonged
to
the
government,
or
two,
foregoing
prompt
possession,
which
here
was
urgently
required.
otherwise
stated,
the
government
had
to
abandon
the
constitutional
power
of
eminent
domain
designed
to
enable
the
united
states
to
acquire
immediately
and
unreservedly
property
needed
for
a
public
purpose
or
it
had
to
forgo
its
claim
of
pre-existing
right
to
the
property
and
pay
the
respondent
for
all
the
windfall
in
order
to
get
him
out
of
that.
certainly,
as
the
court
below
says
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly.
respondent
with
--
however
be
no
better
off.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
and
i
think
there's
no
question
of
the
power
to
seize
by,
if
you
will,
by
way
of
judicial
proceeding.
i
suppose
the
respondent
did
see
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
suppose
we
might
be
met
in
the
court
of
claims
with
quite
--
with
exactly
the
same
argument
that
having
elected
to
exercise
the
eminent
domain
powered
by
seizure
that
we
had
admitted
that
the
property
wasn't
ours.
we
didn't
proceed
by
ejectment.
so,
i
suppose
the
same
argument
would
--
would
or
might
been
an
aid
in
--
in
the
context
of
the
court
of
claims.
putting
aside
for
the
moment
whether
--
of
any
positive
virtue
and
having
two
lawsuits
here
rather
than
one,
a
preliminary
action
and
ejectment
followed
by
evaluation
proceeding,
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
practical
consequence
of
proceeding
by
way
of
ejectment.
if
we've
been
fortunate,
i
suppose
we
might
have
obtained
a
lower
court
decision
within
a
few
months.
and
then
i
suppose
an
appeal
on
the
question
of
title
might
have
been
taken
and
that
might
mean
another
six
months
to
a
year.
of
course,
if
we
prevail
in
that,
there'd
be
an
opportunity
to
apply
90
days
for
a
writ
from
this
court.
and
i
think
with
any
kind
of
good
fortune,
a
resourceful
opposing
counsel
might
have
been
able
to
spin
out
the
ejectment
proceeding
for
most
or
all
of
the
balance
of
the
lease
term.
in
the
meantime,
of
course,
the
united
states
in
lieu
of
having
a
--
an
operating
missile
base
would
have
a
going
lawsuit.
i'd
also
like
to
stress
that
the
government's
condemnation
complaint
which
tendered
the
question,
what
if
anything
is
respondent
entitled
to
by
way
of
just
compensation,
deprived
respondent
of
no
right,
whatever.
certainly,
the
government
had
the
indisputable
authority
to
take
this
land
for
a
public
use
regardless
of
the
identity
of
the
persons
who
held
the
adverse
interests
regardless
of
the
distribution
of
those
interests.
and
the
only
possible
unfairness,
it
seems
to
us,
flows
from
respondent's
theory,
which
means
if
it
is
accepted
that
in
a
case
where
the
government
feels
it's
urgent
to
take
over
the
property,
it
may
have
to
pay
what
may
--
for
what
may
already
belong
to
it.
the
only
opinions
which
are
cited
by
the
court
below,
which
seemed
to
us
to
furnish
any
support
at
all
for
the
result
reached,
are
illinois
state
court
decisions.at
record
469,
the
court
will
note
several
references
to
state
court
decisions
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
it's
true
that
the
state
courts
in
illinois
have
held
that
a
corporation
possessing
eminent
domain
powers
under
the
law
of
that
state,
that
such
corporations
have
the
duty
to
determine
in
advance
of
condemnation
the
outstanding
title
that
they
have
the
duty
to
make
that
determination
at
their
peril
and
that
they
cannot
try
any
issues
as
to
title
in
the
condemnation
proceeding.
we
have
no
dispute
that
under
illinois
procedures,
you
apparently
cannot
try
a
title
or
a
question
of
title
and
a
question
of
valuation
in
the
same
case.
and
certainly,
illinois
may
circumscribe
the
powers
of
eminent
domain
exercised
by
illinois
corporations
as
it
chooses.
now,
our
point
is
simply
that
illinois
law
cannot
control
the
exercise
by
the
united
states
of
its
eminent
domain
power.
if
this
so-called
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies,
which
was
applied
here,
goes
to
substance
as
respondent
argues
at
page
8
of
its
brief,
then
we
think
it
follows
necessarily
that
federal
law
controls.
as
this
court
has
often
stated
notably
in
united
states
against
miller
in
317
u.s.,
a
case
incidentally
decided
when
there
was
still
conformity
with
local
procedure,
state
rules,
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion,
“do
not
and
could
not
effect
questions
of
substantive
right
grounded
upon
the
federal
eminent
domain
power”.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
maybe
because
in
some
states,
the
state
condemnation
courts
have
very
limited
jurisdiction.
and
some
jurisdictions,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
--
the
states
have
appraisal
commissions
which
can't
try
a
title
under
their
jurisdictional
grant
under
limited
value
of
questions.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
exactly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
illinois
decisions
themselves
in
holding
--
making
the
holding
to
which
i've
just
referred,
state
that
in
illinois,
condemnation
is
special
and
statutory
and
the
court
has
statutory
jurisdiction,
limited
jurisdiction.
now,
if
this
question
of
election
of
remedy
so-called
is
one
of
procedure,
the
result,
we
think,
is
the
same
for
since
1951,
when
rule
71a
was
promulgated,
the
federal
rules
have
governed
and
governed
exclusively
condemnation
by
the
united
states.
now,
rule
71a
does
not
contemplate,
does
not
require
an
independent
proceeding
for
purposes
of
ascertaining
or
defining
the
respective
interests
of
those
whose
property
is
taken
rather
it
provides
that
the
government
shall
proceed
in
rem
and
then
declares
that
the
government
shall
join,
as
defendants,
those
persons
whose
names
are
then
known,
“having
or
claiming,”
this
is
the
exact
language
of
rule,
“having
or
claiming
an
interest
in
the
property.”
then
there's
further
provision
of
the
rule
for
designating
other
persons
as
unknown
owners.
respondent
makes
an
argument,
which
we
don't
think
is
substantial,
that
state
rules
may
be
applied
notwithstanding
the
enactment
of
rule
71a.
and
this
is
an
argument
which
takes
several
steps,
and
perhaps
i'd
better
go
briefly
through
it.
there
is
a
federal
statute,
50
u.s.c.
171
which
dates
back
to
1890,
which
declares
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
may
cause
condemnation
proceedings
to
be
instituted
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
for
various
designated
purposes.
and
that
statute,
in
keeping
with
the
old
conformity
provisions,
declared
that
such
proceedings
were
to
be
instituted
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
of
the
state
wherein
the
proceeding
was
instituted.
now,
rule
71a,
of
course,
was
designed
to
do
away
with
conformity
to
state
procedures
and
indeed,
the
advisory
note
to
the
rule
cited
this
50
u.s.c.
171
as
one
of
the
statutes
which
occasioned
the
need
for
the
rule.
but
we
come
now
to
a
minor
complication.
in
1956,
congress
adopted
a
recodification
of
the
various
previously
scattered
statutes
relating
to
the
armed
forces
and
it
put
them
all
in
title
10.
50
u.s.c.
171
was
incorporated
and
became
10
u.s.c.
2663.
when
that
recodification
took
place,
the
old
language
in
50
u.s.c.
71
relating
to
conformity
with
state
procedures
was
not
deleted.
so,
the
provision
remained
until
1958
when
congress
making
various
directions
in
the
code
made
--
enacted
a
provision
retroactively
deleting
this
sentence
relating
to
conformity
from
10
u.s.c.
2663.
and
then
the
relevant
reports
accompanying
that
1958
act,
congress
declared
that
the
earlier
failure
to
delete
that
particular
language
at
the
time
the
recodification
took
place
had
been
an
oversight.
we
failed
to
see,
though
the
respondent
seeks
comfort
from
this
history,
how
it
aides
respondent.
in
the
first
place,
rule
71a
became
effective
in
1951.
this
condemnation
was
brought
in
1954.
that
was
the
only
time
the
government
could
possibly
be
charged
on
any
theory
with
having
made
an
election.
the
recodification
taking
place
in
1956
but
thus
have
no
bearing
on
this
case.
but
more
than
that,
we
don't
think
the
recodification
in
1956
can
have
any
proper
bearing
on
any
case
because
at
the
time
of
the
recodification,
congress
made
clear
in
the
statute
which
put
the
recodification
into
effect
that
no
change
in
existing
law
was
either
made
or
intended
thereby.
this
was
purely
a
formal
revision
and
of
course,
the
earlier
1951
adoption
of
the
federal
rule
relating
condemnation
proceedings
must
govern.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
very
58
statute
which
corrected
this
one
corrected
scores
of
others,
your
honor,
apply.
and
getting
back
to
the
mainstream,
i
have
already
stated
that
rule
71a,
as
we
view
it,
contemplates
the
joining
of
defendants
who
claim
to
have
an
interest
in
the
property.
and
this,
we
think,
necessarily
implies
that
the
condemnation
court
is
to
determine
both
the
validity
of
the
claim
and
the
value
of
any
interest
which
may
be
established.
and
i
think
it's
pertinent
to
add,
though
there
are
certainly
no
need
to
labor
the
point
in
this
court,
that
the
basic
scheme
of
the
federal
rules
is
to
provide
a
single
form
of
action
and
to
avoid
unnecessary
multiplicity.
considers,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
the
common
situation
where
the
government
is
condemning
land
as
to
which
the
private
parties
may
have
competing
claims
or
overlapping
interests.
suppose
the
government
names,
as
it
--
as
it
is
supposed
to
do,
all
persons
claiming
an
interest,
names
these
persons
with
overlapping
claims,
would
it
be
contended
then
that
by
naming
both,
we
recognize
both
claims
and
we're
stopped
to
deny
them
and
we're
required
to
take
of
the
same
thing
twice
over?well,
obviously
not,
we'd
say
for
it's
the
burden
of
the
claimant
to
establish
his
right
to
compensation.
and
the
first
step
in
his
proof,
as
we
see
it,
is
that
he
has
an
interest
in
the
property
which
is
to
be
recompensed.
another
common
situation
is
where
the
government
contracts
to
buy
land
at
an
agreed
price
and
then
condemns
that
same
land
in
order
to
remove
any
possible
infirmities
in
the
title,
a
procedure
incidentally
which
has
explicit
congressional
authorization.
we
refer
to
the
relevant
statute
at
page
29
of
our
brief.
now,
the
case
we
have
here
is
not
materially
different
nor
is
it
a
unique
case.
there
are
at
least
two
courts
of
appeals
which
have
dealt
expressly
with
the
contention
which
respondent
made
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case.
the
first
and
the
fifth
circuits,
we
refer
to
those
cases
at
pages
25
to
27
of
our
brief.
in
the
fifth
circuit
turner
case,
the
court
will
note
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
united
states
does
not
waive
any
right
or
title
that
it
may
have
by
proceeding
in
condemnation.
in
the
first
circuit,
san
geronimo
case,
which
is
rather
closely
analogous
on
its
facts
to
this
one,
judge
magruder
pointed
out
that
the
government
there
was
asserting
a
right
to
use
the
premises
in
question
under
the
terms
of
a
lease,
and
that
it
sought
alternatively,
if
that
position
were
denied,
to
condemn
an
interest
in
the
fact.
and
he
said
that
the
pursuit
of
these
alternatives
in
a
single
proceeding
was
characterized
by
much
good
sense.
we
agree,
of
course.
we
say
that
claims
to
property
interests
and
claims
of
title
are
regularly
adjudicated
in
federal
condemnation
cases
as
they
are
in
many
of
the
states
where
the
condemnation
court
has
general
jurisdiction
and
where
it
is
proceeding
under
a
court
with
code
which
provides
a
single
form
of
action.
respondent
is
not
prejudiced
in
this
case
because
his
claim
to
compensation
may
be
defeated
here
by
the
government's
claim
of
right,
whereas
in
the
more
common
situation,
his
claimed
compensation
might
be
defeated
by
a
competing
claim
of
right
asserted
by
another
private
party.
i
come
then,
and
i
shall
attempt
to
treat
it
more
briefly
to
the
second
question,
whether
the
government's
revocation
of
the
lease
was
valid.
this
was
the
issue,
of
course,
that
we
weren't
permitted
to
try
before
the
district
court,
the
issue
as
to
which
it
was
said
we
were
foreclosed.
now,
as
i've
said,
we
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
think
that
is
so.
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
definitive
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals.
however,
i
think
it
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
reading
the
lease
because
in
our
view,
irrespective
of
there
being
in
a
provision
for
revocation
in
the
lease,
the
statute
would
require
the
conclusion
that
the
lease
was
revocable.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
adverted
to
the
statute
and
it
said
that
it
couldn't
really
believe
that
congress
meant
it
when
it
said
that
the
government
was
have
--
was
to
have
the
authority
to
revoke
these
leases
at
anytime
and
that
we
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
[laughs]
now,
in
this
case,
we
--
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
--
is
mandatory
language
and
that
we
find
no
cause
for
skepticism
because
our
reading
of
the
reports
indicates
that
congress
meant
to
do
what
it
was
in
turn
is
doing.
now,
the
military
leasing
statutes,
two
of
them,
one
enacted
in
1916
and
the
other
in
1947
are
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
main
brief.
both,
whichever
one
applies,
both
provide
for
revocation
at
any
time.
we
think
that
the
1947
act
is
probably
the
one
that
controls
here.
and
i
--
i
therefore
concentrate
on
it.
and
i
say
that
we
think
it
controls
because,
as
the
court
may
recall,
the
renewal
of
this
lease
five
years
after
the
original
lease
was
in
1952.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
renewal
must
probably
be
deemed
innovation,
a
new
contract.
and
that
would
seem
to
be
so
because
leases
in
excess
of
five
years
were
prohibited
by
the
1916
act
and
also
because
the
secretary,
under
the
lease,
had
very
broad
powers
to
refuse
the
extension.
turning
then
to
the
1947
act,
that
act,
after
providing
generally
for
the
leasing
of
military
properties
not
contemporaneously
required
by
the
government,
goes
on
to
state
in
the
last
two
sentences
which
appear
at
page
3
of
our
brief,
“each
such
lease
shall
contain
a
provision
permitting
the
secretary
concerned
to
revoke
the
lease
at
any
time,
unless
the
secretary
shall
determine
that
the
omission
of
such
provision
from
the
lease
will
promote
the
national
defense
or
will
be
in
the
public
interest,”
and
then
this,
“in
any
event,
in
any
event
such
lease
shall
be
revocable
by
the
secretary
of
the
department
concerned
during
a
national
emergency
declared
by
the
president.”
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
said
to
the
language
which
requires
or
permits
interpretation,
its
mandatory
language.
and
of
course,
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
in
1950,
the
president
had
declared
a
national
emergency.
and
thus,
in
our
view,
the
lease
was
revocable
in
1954,
whether
or
not,
whether
or
not
the
lease
itself
provided
for
revocation.
now,
since
the
seventh
circuit
seemed
doubtful
that
congress
really
meant
this
provision,
let
me
take
a
moment
to
read
a
single
sentence
from
the
accompanying
house
report
and
that's
house
report
623,
which
we've
cited
in
the
brief.
and
that
report
states,
“regardless
of
whether
the
secretary
does
insert
such
a
clause
in
references
to
a
revocation
clause,
each
lease
made
under
this
law
shall
be
revocable
by
the
secretary
during
a
national
emergency
declared
by
the
president.”
let
me
observe
finally
that
the
lease
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
the
emergency
had
been
declared
in
december
of
1950,
four
years
before
the
revocation
and
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
revocation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
excuse
me.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
i
wanted
to
observe
finally
that
this
revocation
could
not
by
--
in
any
event
be
deemed
a
surprise
by
the
respondent
for
the
lease
in
this
case
did
itself
put
the
respondent
unnoticed
that
it
might
be
revoked
at
any
time
upon
the
60-day
notification.
the
lease,
appears
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
12
as
justice
whittaker
indicated
in
his
question
earlier
in
the
argument,
there
is
a
paragraph
in
the
preamble.
it's
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
on
page
12
upon
which
respondent
relies.
they
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
whereas
clause
refers
to
naval
aviation.
“whereas”
because
of
its
strategic
value,
it
is
considered
essential
that
the
airfield
be
retained
in
standby
status
proposed
for
use
in
connection
with
naval
aviation
activities.
and
of
course,
the
plain
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
this
paragraph
in
the
preamble
is
that
the
secretary
wasn't
authorized
to
lease
property
unless
he
determines
that
it
was
necessary
to
keep
it
in
standby
status.
if
it
were
surplus
and
there
was
no
need
to
keep
it
in
standby
status,
he
was
required
under
the
surplus
property
act
to
dispose
of
it
by
outright
sale.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
the
question
of
value.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
having
been
thrown
out
of
the
front
door,
the
issue
got
in
the
backdoor
in
this
way.
we
could
not
plead
cancellation
but
the
trial
court
did
instruct
the
jury
that
it
could
consider
the
revocation
provision
in
deciding
what
the
value
of
such
a
lease
was,
what
the
market
value
of
it
was.
in
other
words,
a
lease
which
has
some
provision
for
revocation
in
it
has
a
lesser
market
value
than
one
which
is
on
restriction.
and
so
it
came
back
into
the
case
in
that
way
and
the
trial
court
said
in
instructing
the
jury
on
this
valuation
act
back,
that
it
was
revocable
only
for
naval
aviation
purpose.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
couldn't
contend
that
it
had
been
revoked
because
we
had
proceeded
in
condemnation.
but
in
valuing
the
leasehold
interest,
the
jury
could
consider
abstractly
the
value
of
the
lease
which
had
an
unexercised
provision
for
revocation
in
it
and
that
tells
that
fact
into
the
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
court
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
--
well,
the
court
said
that
it
was
revocable
only
for
naval
aviation
purposes
and
that
the
jury
could
estimate
the
likelihood
if
it's
being
revoked
for
that
purpose
in
arriving
at
a
valuation
figure,
perhaps
rather
difficult
task
for
the
jury.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
would
say
so
though
the
jury
was
not
told
anything
about
the
revocation
for
nike
missile
base.
we
weren't
supposed
to
refer
to
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
we
weren't
allowed
to
refer
at
the
trial
to
the
claim
that
we've
cancelled
the
lease.
we
were
stopped.
we've
given
up
our
right
to
--
to
cancel
or
to
rely
on
cancellation
when
we
fail
to
bring
an
action
and
eject
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
had
the
lease
terms
before
it
and
that
expert
of
course.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
court
--
the
district
court's
construction
was
that
the
revocation
power
was
only
a
power
to
revoke,
as
i
have
said,
in
order
to
use
for
naval
aviation
base.
the
court
of
appeals
said
our
power
to
revoke
was
restricted
to
revoking
for
aviation
purposes.
i
don't
know
whether
the
failure
will
include
naval
and
was
inadvertent
or
not
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
i
was
about
to
say
that
we
think
when
one
is
going
to
determine
the
power
of
revocation
from
the
lease,
one
has
to
look
at
the
operative
provision,
which
is
paragraph
14
not
to
the
preamble.
that
paragraph
appears
at
record
19,
and
you
will
note
that
the
parties
agree
that
it
will
--
that
the
lease
will
at
all
times
be
revocable
at
will
by
the
government
upon
presentation
of
60
days
notice
in
the
event
of
default
of
any
of
the
covenants
of
the
lease
or
in
event
of
a
national
emergency
and
the
decision
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
that
such
revocation
is
essential,
and
essential
is
not
there
qualified
by
any
reference
to
naval
aviation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
--
the
revocation
was
signed
jointly
by
the
secretary
of
the
army
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
navy
had
ceded
jurisdiction
over
the
property
to
the
army
but
both
secretaries
acted
in
--
the
notice
of
revocation
shows.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
think
the
defense
establishment
as
a
matter
of
caution
had
the
both
secretaries
on.
i
wanted
to
refer
the
court
for
a
moment
to
paragraph
1
of
the
lease
also
because
this
bears
on
the
--
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
“essential”
as
it
have
used
in
the
revocation
provisions.
paragraph
1
is
the
provision
for
renewal.
you
will
note
that
that
paragraph
gives
the
tenant
the
power
to
terminate
on
60
days
notice.
then
going
on
to
the
matter
of
renewal,
says,
it
may
be
renewed
upon
the
same
conditions
with
the
original
lease
for
another
five
years
provided
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
the
premises
are
not
essential
for
governmental
purposes
only.
and
we
suggest
that
the
word
“essential”
in
the
renewal
provision
is
to
be
given
the
same
meaning
as
the
word
“essential”
as
it
appears
in
the
revocation
provision.
accordingly,
even
if
this
lease
stood
alone,
we
think
respondent
would
be
in
no
position
to
complain
that
the
revocation
was
prompted
by
a
decision
to
use
the
field
for
a
nike
base
rather
than
a
conventional
airfield.
but
it
has
already
argued
the
lease
does
not
stand
alone.
and
we
think
that
the
leasing
statute
would
control
during
a
period
of
national
emergency
even
if
there
were
no
provision
whatever
in
the
contract
for
revocation.
