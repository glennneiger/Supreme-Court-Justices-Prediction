mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
issue
in
the
case
is
what
did
the
parties
intend
by
the
cancellation
clause?
both
the
trial
court
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
there
was
no
question
whatsoever
regarding
the
intention
of
the
parties.
and
that
was
that
the
lease
could
be
canceled
only
for
naval
aviation
activities
which
did
not
include
an
army
nike
site.
now,
this
is
an
extremely
interesting
and
fascinating
legal
interpretation
of
the
lease.
but
it
was
arrived
at
through
the
exercise
of
elementary
rules
of
construction
such
as
one
must
not
take
out
of
context
one
sentence
or
paragraph
of
a
lease
even
if
you
must
construe
the
entire
lease.
also,
this
lease
was
drafted
by
the
government
and
therefore,
it
must
construe
most
strongly
against
the
government.
also,
the
government
is
the
lessor
and
therefore,
the
lease
must
be
construed
most
strongly
against
the
lessor.
also,
the
factual
circumstances
surrounding
the
execution
of
the
lease
and
the
action
of
the
parties
during
the
term
of
the
lease
showing
their
construction
and
understanding
of
the
term
of
--
of
the
meaning
of
the
lease
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court.
and
the
inevitable
conclusion
was
that
the
parties
intended
that
this
lease
could
be
canceled
only
for
naval
aviation
activities
and
for
no
other
purpose.
now,
this
may
be
a
very
novel
--
may
be
a
very
interesting
lease
interpretation
problem,
but
it
certainly
is
not
a
novel
legal
point
or
any
novel
national
interest
point
which,
in
the
opinion
of
respondent,
should
be
of
importance
to
this
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
ample
justification
for
this
court
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals'
experienced
judges
below
have
exhaustedly
reviewed
this
record
and
found
that
this
lease
could
be
canceled
only
for
the
purposes
desired
by
the
parties
which
was
the
naval
aviation
activities.
now,
i
am
talking
strictly
to
the
question
of
the
intention
of
the
parties
which
is
the
first
question
in
the
case.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
court
should
not
go
into
the
question
of
a
leasing
statute
and
the
authority
of
the
parties
to
enter
into
this
type
of
lease
but
to
get
into
the
question
of
what
did
the
parties
intend
necessarily
involves
a
very
laborious
test,
and
i
will
have
to
devote
considerable
part
of
my
argument
to
explaining
the
details
--
the
detail
arguments
giving
rise
to
this
conclusion.
nevertheless,
to
give
ample
justice
to
both
parties
in
this
case,
that
laborious
process
must
be
followed
unless
this
court
takes
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
or
experienced
judges
and
that
this
is
very
close
to
the
type
of
cases
in
which
this
court
does
not
want
to
be
burdened
such
as
disputed
matters
of
fact.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part
of
your
sentence.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
your
honor,
the
amount
of
money
is
trivial
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
but
not
to
the
respondent
who
is
financially
modest
circumstances.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir,
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
what
did
the
parties
intend
by
this
lease.
that
is
the
only
question
i
say
because
in
order
to
decide
that
question,
as
you
will
see,
your
honor,
from
my
argument,
it
involves
a
very
laborious
construction
problem
which
gets
into
factual
situations
in
the
weighing
of
facts.
what
did
the
parties
mean
by
these
things
that
they
did
during
the
term
of
the
lease?
what
was
the
situation
when
the
lease
was
executed?
those
are
really
factual
questions
that
have
direct
bearing
upon
the
meaning
of
this
lease
as
far
as
the
intent
of
the
parties
are
concerned.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
oh,
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
because
of
the
more
important
questions
that
i'm
sure,
your
honor,
that
we
are
in
this
court,
united
states
supreme
court
only
because
of
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
problem.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
your
honor.
they'll
still
open
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
navy
leasing
statutes.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
your
honor,
because
we
would
still
have
to
convince
this
court
that
the
parties
were
authorized
by
the
navy
leasing
statutes
to
enter
into
a
lease
which
had
this
intention.
in
other
words,
do
it
--
does
a
navy
leasing
statutes
authorize
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
enter
into
a
lease
which
is
limited
in
cancellation
scope
to
only
naval
aviation
activities,
which
is
a
second
issue
in
the
case,
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that
later,
your
honor,
unless
you
desire
me
to
talk
about
it
now.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
at
this
point,
the
intention
of
the
parties
is
all
that
i
am
talking
about.
what
did
they
intend
by
the
lease?
now,
if
they
intended
that
the
lease
should
be
canceled
only
for
naval
aviation
activities,
then
it
is
my
burden
to
establish
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
it
that
they
have
the
power
under
the
navy
leasing
statutes
to
do
so.
now,
in
the
event
the
court
--
this
court
does
desire
and
conclude
that
it
is
necessary
to
construe
the
terms
of
this
lease
and
all
the
circumstances
surrounding
its
execution
and
the
acts
of
the
parties
after
the
lease
was
executed,
if
it
is
necessary
to
do
this,
then
the
respondents
suggest
the
following
considerations.
first,
let
us
examine
the
background
of
the
parties
at
the
time
this
lease
was
executed
back
in
1947.
the
navy
had
used
this
airport
which
was
a
small
96-acre
piece
of
land
with
a
hanger
on
it
and
one
barracks
building
and
the
rest
was
all
grass
which
was
used
for
the
landing
and
take
off
of
aircraft.
the
navy
had
no
congressional
appropriations
to
maintain
this
field
as
navy
property,
it
have
the
choice
between
selling
it
as
surplus
property
or
to
retain
it
by
keeping
title
in
the
united
states
government
and
leasing
to
a
private
airport
operators
such
as
the
respondent
who
would
maintain
the
property
during
the
term
of
the
lease
so
that
the
navy
could
have
the
property
back
in
case
of
another
international
emergency.
now,
it's
very
important,
your
honor,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
evidence
is
conclusive
on
this,
there's
no
dispute
between
the
parties
at
all
on
these
--
of
these
--
these
facts
that
i
am
stating.
now,
the
navy
had
only
one
thing
in
mind
at
this
time
and
that
was
if
they
have
a
navy
airport
which
they
might
want
back
in
the
case
of
another
future
national
emergency
or
a
war.
the
respondent
was
a
small
--
financially
small
company
but
it
was
vastly
experienced
the
aviation
and
airport
operations.
and
the
parties
were
thinking
of
only
one
simple
fact.
there
is
an
airport
with
aircraft
flying
off
of
it.
we
have
it.
the
navy
says
“we
have
the
airport,
we
don't
need
it.
do
you
want
to
undertake
the
obligation
of
maintaining
it
and
sharing
the
buildings,”
which
incidentally
was
a
very
expensive
thing,
“and
giving
in
fact
to
us
in
case
we
need
it
again
for
naval
aviation
activities?”
there
could
be
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
this
is
what
the
parties
thought.
now,
they
placed
all
this
thinking
in
the
preamble
of
the
lease.
and
on
page
12
of
the
record,
we
find
that
the
preamble
states,
“whereas,
because
of
a
strategic
value,
it
is
considered
essential
that
the
said
airfield
and
the
facilities
thereon,
comprising
the
united
states
naval
outlying
airfield,
be
retained
in
a
stand-by
status
for
post-war
use
in
connection
with
naval
aviation
activities.”
there
isn't
any
doubt
in
the
world
that
this
sentence
expresses
exactly
what
the
parties
wanted.
in
the
next
paragraph
of
the
preamble
states
that
--
that
lessee
desires
to
lease
the
airfield
and
the
facilities
thereon
for
use
as
an
airport
and
for
such
other
uses
as
may
be
necessary
or
incidental
for
this
purpose.
now,
the
third
--
on
top
of
page
13,
the
preamble
also
states
that
this
leasing
--
that
this
lease
is
deemed
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
government.
now,
the
important
words
are
the
following,
appearing
at
the
top
of
page
13
in
the
consideration
clause,
the
parties
then
stated
after
reciting
their
intention
above,
“now,
therefore
in
consideration
of
the
foregoing,”
now,
that
--
those
words
in
consideration
of
the
foregoing
show
that
the
parties
had
in
mind
the
premise
--
the
premises
or
the
preamble
and
intended
to
bring
the
preamble
into
the
body
of
the
lease
just
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
set
forth
in
full
in
the
body
of
the
lease.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
an
identical
case,
not
involving
airport
property
of
course,
where
the
words
were
“now,
therefore
in
consideration
of
the
premises,”
which
is
even
weaker
than
our
case,
which
says,
“now,
therefore,
in
consideration
of
the
foregoing,”
so
there
can
be
doubt
what
foregoing
means,
held
that
the
preamble
must
be
construed
as
an
operative
part
of
the
lease
where
that
those
words
appear
in
the
consideration
clause
of
the
lease.
now,
relying
upon
that
case,
which
certainly
is
consistent
with
any
state
or
federal
law
on
the
construction
of
contracts
is
a
simple
construction
problem,
so
i
think
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
decision
is
certainly
a
good
authority
in
the
federal
courts.
i
think
the
federal
courts
undoubtedly
should
reach
and
will
reach
that
conclusion
as
the
seventh
circuit
did.
relying
upon
that
case,
the
court
then
also
took
into
consideration
the
following
language
of
this
lease.
paragraph
12
of
the
lease,
on
the
record
page
19,
states
that
the
lessee
agrees,
they
will
prevent
any
use
of
the
premises
and
facilities
herein
demised
to
its
possession
including
the
construction,
erection,
alteration
or
growth
of
any
structure
or
other
object
thereon
which
would
be
a
hazard
to
the
landing,
taking
off
or
maneuvering
of
aircraft
at
the
airfield.
this
is
a
prohibition
against
the
lessee
respondent
ever
using
that
property
in
a
way
which
would
interfere
with
flying
operations
of
aircraft.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
your
honor,
i'm
sorry
i
should
have
--
may
i
answer
that,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
paragraph
14
merely
states
that
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
the
power
to
cancel
the
lease
upon
60
days
notice
in
case
of
a
national
emergency,
national
emergency
is
not
in
this
case
because
we
concede
that
it
was
an
existence
at
the
time,
but
the
decision
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
that
such
revocation
is
essential.
now,
the
word
“essential”
must
refer
to
something.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
the
word
“essential”
refers
to
the
preamble
which
clearly
expresses
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
government
to
keep
this
property
only
for
naval
aviation
purposes.
and
that
is
why
the
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
pardon
me.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
you
mean
turn
them
over
so
it
became
a
naval
nike
operation?
no,
your
honor,
because,
as
i
will
later
explain,
under
no
conceivable
interpretation
as
it's
possible
in
this
case
to
argue
that
nike
is
naval
--
is
naval
aviation.
number
one,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
prove
that
nike
is
aviation
or
an
aviation
activity.
on
the
contrary,
the
only
testimony
on
that
point
is
in
favor
of
the
respondent
where,
at
page
307
of
the
record,
it
appears
from
the
testimony
that
nike
is
not
aviation.
now,
if
nike
is
aviation,
then
i
think
it's
up
to
the
burden
of
this
--
of
the
government
to
approve
in
that
fact
in
the
court.
we
proved
it
by
having
the
only
testimony
in
the
case
that
it
wasn't
aviation.
so
we
certainly
did
our
burden
but
the
government
never
proved
it
and
it's
a
little
late
for
the
government
to
at
this
time
make
these
arguments,
your
honor.
but
there
is
even
a
more
fundamental
point
on
that.
and
nike
is
a
guided
missile
which
is
no
more
different
than
an
army
anti-aircraft
gun.
now,
an
anti-aircraft
gun
is
not
aviation
because
the
shell
flies
through
the
air
neither
is
nike
aviation
because
the
missile
flies
through
the
air.
if
that
is
true,
an
arrow
flying
through
the
air
would
be
aviation.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
understood
and
the
trial
court
understood
when
they
held
this
way.
so,
the
government,
in
effect,
has
not
proven
that
nike
is
aviation
or
it
comes
within
the
definition
of
naval
aviation
by
failing
to
introduce
any
evidence
whatsoever
about
it.
but
even
if
this
court
were
to
take
judicial
notice
of
what
nike
is,
they
couldn't
conceivably
hold,
we
respectfully
submit,
that
this
is
aviation,
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
--
at
least
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
intention
of
parties
as
expressed
in
this
lease
because,
as
i
mentioned
before,
certain
paragraphs
of
this
lease
expressly
prohibit
the
lessee
from
using
the
field
in
anyway
to
obstruct
flying.
now,
flying
means
aircraft.
it
doesn't
need
guided
missiles.
now,
this
is
very
forcefully
demonstrated
by
defendant's
exhibit
2b,
appearing
at
page
433
of
the
record.
now,
in
our
opinion,
probably
the
best
authority
in
the
world
to
decide
what
is
meant
by
naval
aviation
is
the
bureau
of
aeronautics
of
the
navy
department.
they
have
cognizance
of
naval
aviation.
and
at
page
--
i'm
sorry,
on
page
433
of
the
record
is
a
letter
from
the
bureau
of
aeronautics
to
the
chief
of
the
yards
and
docks
via
the
chief
of
naval
operations
dated
26th,
june
1953,
which
was
one
year
before
our
lease
was
--
which
was
one
year
before
the
government
attempted
to
revoke
our
lease.
in
this
letter,
the
bureau
of
aeronautics
states
that
it
knows
of
no
prior
immobilization
plans
which
are
required
the
use
of
this
property
for
aeronautical
purposes.
consequently,
it's
recommended
that
the
outlying
arlington
heights
be
declared
as
excess
to
the
needs
of
naval
aviation
and
unless
needed
by
some
other
naval
activity
disposed
of
as
surplus
property.
now,
the
crucial
part
of
this
letter
is
the
last
paragraph,
number
two.
“in
as
much
as
it
is
indicated
that
the
area
surrounding
the
field
as
being
build
up
rapidly
and
hence
holds
no
promise
for
future
naval
aviation
usage,
practically
the
same
words
of
the
lease.it
is
recommended
that
the
field
be
disposed
of
without
any
conditions
as
to
recapture
or
use.”
now,
the
importance
of
that
paragraph
is
that
the
navy
recognized
that
because
the
field
was
being
crowded
by
homes
at
that
time,
it
became
dangerous
to
use
the
field
for
naval
aviation
purposes
which
was
applying
of
aircraft.
now,
if
the
navy
--
if
the
bureau
of
aeronautics
which
has
cognizance
of
what
is
naval
aviation
thought
that
guided
missiles
were
part
of
this
naval
aviation,
they
would
not
be
worrying
about
approach
areas
over
homes
such
as
airplanes
have
to
do
and
airplanes
can't
fall
down
which
is
one
of
the
big
problems
of
the
navy
with
these
airports
around
the
country.
in
fact,
the
nike
site
that
is
there
today
is
surrounded
since
that
time
strictly
by
homes
because
nike
does
not
have
to
make
an
approach
over
the
homes
in
order
to
be
useful.
so,
on
all
points,
your
honor,
as
we
respectively
submit
that
the
--
the
government's
position
is
--
is
incorrect
on
the
interpretation
of
the
lease.
in
addition,
i'd
like
to
mention
just
one
more
point
because
too
much
time
is
--
i'm
forced
to
put
too
much
time
on
this
interpretation
problem.
but
the
record
shows,
at
208
of
the
record,
that
a
year
after
this
lease
was
executed
in
1947,
the
lessee
spent
over
$60,000
of
its
money
in
improving
the
barracks
buildings
and
changing
them
into
apartments
for
public
housing
and
in
building
a
trailer
park
on
the
premises
adjacent
to
the
barracks.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
navy,
not
only
knew
of
this
project,
but
approved
of
it
in
advance.
they
gave
their
approval
to
the
lessee
doing
so.
now,
it
just
doesn't
stand
through
reason
that
any
lessee
would
spend
$60,000
not
at
least
the
lessee
of
this
character
about
the
circumstances.
on
the
--
it
would
spend
$60,000
of
its
own
money
on
the
assumption
that
it
could
be
canceled
out
on
60
days
notice
for
any
governmental
purpose
at
all
as
now
contended
for
by
the
government.
it
was
relying
upon
the
preamble
of
the
lease
and
the
intention
of
the
parties
right
down
the
line
that
it
could
be
canceled
only
for
naval
aviation
activities.
this
was
a
calculated
risk
that
the
lessee,
as
an
aviation
expert,
could
understand
and
could
take
and
use
his
own
judgment
on
as
a
sensible
businessman.
but
he
could
not
possibly
foresee
of
how
--
what
million
and
one
chances
the
government
might
have
to
revoke
this
lease
for
governmental
purposes
only.
it's
just
as
beyond
belief
to
believe
that
the
parties
so
intended
in
view
of
the
language
and
their
conduct.
if
the
navy
thought
that
this
could
be
canceled
for
governmental
purposes,
it
would
never,
i
am
sure,
have
permitted
the
lessee
to
go
ahead
and
spend
$60,000
on
the
property
on
that
basis
of
revocation.
mr.
leonard

a
defense
facility
for
an

--
mr.
leonard
r.

--
if
it's
used
for
air
--
airplanes
landing
and
taking
of
airplanes,
it
would
come
within
the
definition
of
aviation,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
and
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
this
--
this
was
never
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
in
the
case,
your
honor.
for
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
absolutely,
your
honor.
this
field,
they
have
completely
built
nike
which
is
a
very
heavy
structure
extension
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
of
the
ground.
throughout
the
landing
area,
it
would
be
impossible
today
to
land
a
plane
there
without
spending
more
money
than
this
property
is
worth
to
remove
nike
and
this
is
an
actual
fact,
and
the
juries
thought,
and
this
is
one
of
the
factors
incidentally,
your
honor,
that
impressed
the
trial
court
and
the
jury
on
this
question.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes.
we
took
the
jury
out
with
the
permission
of
the
court
to
view
the
premises
and
they
are
very
much
impressed
by
the
nike
and
the
fact
that
it
destroyed
the
field
for
aviation
purposes.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
oh,
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
they
knew
all
about
nike.
the
only
thing
that
the
jury
did
not
know
about
was
the
fact
that
the
lease
had
been
canceled
or
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
whether
by
the
government
to
cancel
the
lease.
now,
we
got
into
some
very
peculiar
trial
procedures
primarily
and
this
is
one
reason
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
it
was
an
incredible
problem.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
oh,
there's
no
question
about
it.
everyone
conceded
the
fact
at
the
trial
in
oral
argument
and
right
down
the
line.
everybody
knew
that
we're
talking
about
the
nike
site.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that's
right.
there's
no
question
about
that,
your
honor
and
i
think
the
trial
court
was
right
because
that
is
a
construction
placed
upon
the
lease
by
not
only
of
the
trial
court
but
the
very
experienced
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
there
is
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well,
it
really
got
us
--
no,
actually,
i
think
the
trial
judge
was
wrong
in
the
sense
of
permitting
the
government
to
use
the
theory
before
the
jury
that
this
lease
has
no
value
because
it
could
be
canceled
for
any
reason
whatsoever
of
governmental
purpose.
we,
of
course,
testified
to
the
jury
that
the
lease
could
be
canceled
only
for
naval
aviation
purposes.
unfortunately,
the
trial
court
did
not
make
up
his
or
did
not
instruct
the
jury
rather
on
this
issue
until
after
all
the
evidence
was
in.
so,
throughout
this
trial,
the
jury
was
hearing
for
all
it
can,
the
government
appraiser
sells
worth
nothing,
our
appraisers
test
--
i
mean
our
witnesses
testified
of
a
value
close
to
$200,000.
based
upon
our
theory,
the
government
saw
this
worth
nothing.
the
jury
was
confused,
that
is
why
the
court
granted
an
arbitrary
in
the
case
of
an
additional
$50,000
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
refused
to
consider
the
evident
questions
as
a
matter
of
dispute.
but
it's
an
interesting
point,
your
honor,
when
we
come
to
the
question
over
the
stuff
over
the
election
of
remedies.
this
comes
to
a
very
major
consideration.
so
much
time
has
been
spent
on
the
interpretation
of
the
lease.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
leasing
statutes,
if
i
may,
at
this
point,
rather
hurriedly.
pardon
me,
i've
lost
the
amount
of
time
i
have
available.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
thank
you.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
statutes
gave,
and
regardless
of
which
of
the
statutes
we
talked
about
the
1916
act
or
the
1947
navy
leasing
statute,
they
read
practically
the
same
that
if
a
national
emergency
occurs,
the
navy
has
a
right
to
cancel
the
lease,
must
retain
the
right
to
cancel
the
lease
at
anytime,
and
that
is
roughly
or
exactly
the
language
of
--
of
both
acts.
and
the
government
and
the
respondent
both
concede
that
it
makes
no
difference
under
which
act
we
are
discussing
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
statute
gave
the
navy
--
these
both
statutes
gave
the
navy
the
power
to
lease
on
a
limited
revocability
basis,
namely,
naval
aviation
instead
of
limiting
them
for
the
navy
leases
to
those
which
be
--
could
be
canceled
for
only
governmental
purposes.
now,
this
decision
is
a
tremendous
advantage
to
the
government,
to
the
--
to
the
navy,
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
by
construing
the
statutes
the
way
they
did,
the
--
the
navy
is
given
the
power
to
use
either
one
of
these
two
methods.
they
can
either
put
into
the
lease.
the
--
it
must
be
canceled
for
any
reason
whatsoever,
governmental
purposes,
or
they
can
do
what
they
do
on
our
lease
so
that
they
can
cancel
for
only
naval
aviation
purposes
or
some
other
specific
purpose
which
is
the
basic
reason
for
the
property
being
recaptured
by
the
navy.
in
other
words,
if
the
shipyard,
then
the
revocation
clause
would
be
pinpointed
to
one
who
may
be
needed
that
shipyard
again.
now,
oddly
enough,
the
government
in
this
case
is
challenging
the
grant
to
it
a
broad
discretionary
power
is
vested
into
it
under
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision.
usually,
the
government
is
always
saying,
“you're
taking
away
our
powers.
we
don't
like
it.”
here,
the
government
is
getting
an
additional
power
by
the
construction
of
the
acts
by
the
seventh
circuit.
now,
it's
a
strange
thing
that
the
government
is
now
asking
this
court
to
deprive
the
government
of
powers
granted
to
it
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
the
government
is
coming
into
this
court
and
saying,
“your
honors,
we
don't
want
these
broad
powers.
we
only
want
to
be
able
to
lease
on
the
basis
of
a
revocation
where
any
governmental
purpose
is
the
basis
for
the
revocation.”
now,
this
just
doesn't
sound
like
a
federal
agency.
this
is
a
futile
and
needless
request
being
made
by
the
government
in
this
case
upon
this
court
because
all
the
navy
has
to
do
in
the
future
in
its
leases
is
to
put
into
the
recaptured
clause
or
the
cancellation
clause
of
its
leases
whichever
provision
it
want
if
they
want
to
put
in
broad
powers
so
that
it
can
be
revoked
only
for
governmental
purposes,
let
them
put
it
in.
if
they
want
to
restrict
it
to
shipyard
purposes
or
any
other
purpose
or
in
naval
aviation
purposes,
let
the
navy
put
it
in.
now,
this
advantage
is
tremendous
because
here,
we
have
the
secretary
of
navy
engaged
in
one
of
the
largest,
most
comprehensive
leasing
programs
in
the
united
states.
it's
got
shipyards,
it's
got
airports,
it's
got
practically
everything.
and
the
1947
act,
i
believe,
if
my
memory
is
correct,
also
includes
personal
property
as
well
as
real
estate.
the
vastness
of
this
leasing
program
is
tremendous.the
statute
in
its
own
wording
says
that
he
shall
have
complete
discretion
as
to
what
he
does
until
we
come
to
the
one
question
that
he
--
one
sentence
that
it
must
be
cancelable
at
any
time.
now,
that
word
“at
any
time,”
the
government
is
now
adding
the
additional
words
for
any
governmental
purpose.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
saying
any
governmental
purpose
or
isn't
one
word
in
there.
all
the
statute
say
is
that
the
lease
must
be
canceled
at
any
time
during
a
national
emergency.
this
is
exactly
what
our
lease
does.
our
lease
says
that
it
can
be
canceled
for
naval
aviation
activities
at
any
time
during
the
national
emergency.
this
is
the
whole
purpose
of
leasing
to
us
in
the
first
place.
the
navy
had
an
airport.
the
navy
wanted
back
in
case
of
another
war
or
national
emergency
and
they
reserve
that
right
to
have
it
back
in
case
of
another
national
emergency
or
war.
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
it
is
absurd.
it's
ridiculous
to
construe
a
statute
any
other
way.
and
a
sensible
reasonable
businessman
doing
business
with
the
government,
they
have
to
--
you
have
to
place
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
a
position
where
he
can
negotiate
contracts
which
will
benefit
the
navy
in
a
sense
that
they
will
get
solvent
and
financially
responsible
people
to
become
lessees.
now,
a
sensible
businessman
will
simply
not
expose
himself
to
the
hazards
of
a
lease
which
can
be
cancelable
for
any
reason
whatsoever.
and
on
that
point,
interestingly
enough,
the
only
case
that
has
ever
been
decided
to
my
knowledge
on
the
very
point
we're
talking
about
in
the
1916
or
the
1947
act,
there's
a
hingham
management
case
which
is
cited
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
now,
interestingly
first
of
all,
that
case
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this
one
because
the
language
is
explicitly
clear
that
--
that
it
followed
--
that
it
can
be
--
release
can
be
canceled
at
any
time
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
any
purpose.
there's
no
question
the
language
is
completely
different.
there
is
no
preamble.
there
are
no
circumstances
or
anything
else
such
as
in
this
case.
but
it's
an
interesting
case
from
this
point
of
view.
it
was
a
case
that
involved
lessees
who
turned
into
crooks
and
who
stole
the
navy's
property.
now,
that
is
the
kind
of
an
operator
or
a
lessee
the
navy
is
going
to
end
up
with
if
this
court
is
to
hold
that
the
leasing
statutes
must
be
construed
to
mean
that
they
can
be
canceled
for
any
governmental
purpose
whatsoever.
it's
just
inconceivable
as
reasonable
businessman
or
anyone
to
get
into
a
venture
like
that.
the
only
type
of
person
that
i
can
even
think
of
who
would
get
into
a
lease
with
the
government
which
said
he
could
be
canceled
for
any
governmental
purpose
whatsoever
is
a
sheepherder
who
has
got
maybe
a
thousand
sheep
and
he
has
to
run
them
over
some
grass
that
the
navy
owns
this
practically
revocable
permit.
they
do
this
all
the
time
in
california.
but
a
man
who
is
leasing
a
shipyard
and
who
has
a
payroll
of
thousands
of
people
and
who
is
putting
in
improvements
on
the
property
as
we
did
just
cannot
take
that
type
of
a
hazard.
so
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
it's
unreasonable
and
absurd
to
construe
the
navy
leasing
statutes
in
the
manner
which
the
government
is
now
contending
the
board.
now,
on
page
38
of
respondent's
brief
is
an
excerpt
from
the
senate
committee
report
and
the
joint
army
and
navy
department
letters
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
which
tells
the
purpose
of
a
1947
statute
and
this
is
exactly
the
way
i
have
been
explaining
it.
this
is
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
passed
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
38,
your
honor.
well,
the
excerpt
brief,
while
all
of
these
plans
and
that
would
refer
to
airports
or
anything
else,
they
have
to
be
talking
about
plans,
may
not
be
adaptable
to
peacetime
uses
as
many
as
possible
will
be
leased
to
responsible
companies
which
can
operate
them
without
making
such
changes
as
to
prevent
their
being
rapidly
put
back
into
operation
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
navy
gave
us
the
lease
and
they
wanted
the
property
back
exactly
the
way
they
gave
it
to
us
in
1947,
and
we're
obligated
as
lessee
to
give
it
back
to
them
exactly
as
this
committee
report
says
so
that
the
navy
could
rapidly
put
the
airport
back
in
the
operation
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
it
is
conclusive,
your
honor,
that
congress
never
intended
the
ridiculous
construction
of
these
--
of
these
leasing
statutes
that
the
government
is
now
contending
for.
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
didn't
make
sense
and
the
trial
court
said
it
didn't
make
sense.
on
the
election
around
this
point,
i
think
--
i
--
i
say
this
with
all
deference
to
the
counsel
for
the
government.
my
--
our
position,
respondent's
position
on
election
of
remedies
was
not
stated
exactly
correctly.
number
one,
and
i
think
the
--
the
guts
of
our
argument
might
be
summarized
in
two
statements.
by
trying
to
contest
title
in
condemnation,
the
government
wants
to
have
its
cake
and
also
to
eat
it
on
the
grounds
of
expediency.
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
will
prevent
this
unconscionable
result.
and
i
would
like
to
later
describe
how
unconscionable
it
is
to
let
this
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
not
apply
to
condemnation
when
it
applies
to
every
other
field
of
law.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--the
election
of
remedies
issue
and
it
isn't
as
simple
as
the
government's
argument
seems
to
--
might
indicate.
first
of
all,
if
this
court
is
to
--
does
sustain
our
position
on
the
lease,
obviously,
the
election
of
remedies
issue
is
no
longer
pertinent.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
court
does
not
agree
with
our
position
on
the
lease
then
the
election
of
remedy
issue
becomes
of
great
importance
to
the
condemnee.
now,
the
facts
in
every
case
are
important
and
it
is
pretty
difficult
to
discuss
general
principles
of
law
without
saying,
“what
are
the
facts
in
the
particular
case?”
and
therefore,
on
this
argument
of
election
of
remedies,
i
would
appreciate
if
this
court
would
start
with
the
simple
fundamental
proposition
that
we
are
not
in
the
position
of
squatters.
i
don't
know
what
the
law
is
with
reference
to
squatters
but
i
do
know
that
we
held
possession
for
seven
and
one-half
years
under
color
of
a
formal
naval
lease.
we
operated
the
property
and
maintained
that
on
behalf
of
the
navy
and
we
did
everything
in
compliance
faithfully
with
that
lease.
we
think
it's
most
unconscionable
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
now
seek
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
by
taking
two
inconsistent
positions,
number
one,
that
you
don't
have
a
title
to
this
--
to
the
lease,
under
the
lease.
or
number
two,
we're
going
to
grab
it
anyhow
regardless.
and
i
would
like
to
show
later
in
this
argument
how
this
works
and
will
work
a
tremendous
hardship
upon
all
condemnees
situated
such
as
this
lessee
was
situated
if
the
government's
theory
of
this
case
on
election
of
remedies
is
followed
by
this
court.
prior
to
the
case
at
bar,
there
are
only
four
cases
in
the
whole
history
of
united
states
in
which
the
right
of
the
government
to
contest
title
of
the
condemnee
was
an
issue.
in
all
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
government
except
the
u.s.
versus
turner
and
u.s.
versus
san
geronimo,
in
all
the
other
cases,
the
issue
of
election
of
remedies
was
never
made
a
part
of
the
case
so
they
weren't
discussed
in
the
case.
now,
it
is
important
to
understand
that
a
determination
in
our
favor
in
this
case
will
not
in
any
way
affect
the
governmental
procedures
that
have
been
going
out
for
years
about
title
contest
as
between
claimants
to
different
funds.
and
the
court
of
appeals
makes
this
distinction
very
clearly.
in
fact
because
of
the
paucity
of
election
on
remedy
cases
such
us
ours
where
there
was
a
title
contest
in
the
condemnation
proceeding
and
the
point
was
actually
argued
and
decided
since
there
are
only
four
of
those
cases
in
the
whole
history
of
the
country,
the
occasion
can't
arise
very
often
and
the
possibilities
of
it
arising
hereafter
again
is
very
remote.
therefore,
when
the
government
argues
expediency,
justifies
the
result
in
this
case,
it
is
a
fallacious
argument.
now,
the
government
relies
u.s.
versus
turner
and
u.s.
versus
san
geronimo
development
company,
both
of
which
held
that
the
condemnee's
title
can
be
contested
in
a
condemnation
proceeding.
in
other
words,
these
two
cases
do
support
the
government's
position.
the
turner
case
was
decided
in
1949
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
decided
the
san
geronimo
case
in
1946.
on
the
other
hand,
interestingly
enough,
there
are
exactly
two
cases
supporting
our
position
and
the
court
of
appeals
below.
one
was
u.s.
versus
chicago
b
&
q.
railroad
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
back
in
very
early
days
and
u.s.
versus
1148
of
acres
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1954.
u.s.
versus
11
acres
is
an
election
of
remedies
case
saying
that
you
cannot
contest
title
in
a
condemnation
proceeding.
you
cannot
test
the
title
of
the
condemnee
in
a
condemnation
proceeding.
it
directly
overrules
the
holding
in
u.s.
versus
turner
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
government
and
which
was
decided
it
by
the
same
fifth
circuit,
seven
or
so
years
before.
now,
it
overrules
the
turner
case,
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
turner
case.
but
the
net
result
is
that
it
overrules
that
there's
any
doubt
about
it.
and
the
turner
case
and
--
and
--
pardon
me.
in
the
u.s.
versus
11
acres
as
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
one
of
the
federal
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
below,
as
one
of
the
federal
cases
establishing
a
federal
law
of
this
country
to
be,
that
you
cannot
contest
title
in
a
condemnation
proceeding.
now,
the
net
result
is
that
the
government
in
this
case
has
only
the
old
san
geronimo
case
to
rely
upon
as
far
as
what
the
court
of
appeals
below
has
done.
the
san
geronimo
case,
the
court
in
that
case
and
there's
no
evidence
if
the
parties
really
brought
up
the
election
of
remedies
point,
in
that
decision,
from
reading
it
as,
that
may
very
well
have
been
that
the
judge
just
passingly
said
that
this
is
a
hybrid
proceeding
justified
only
by
the
peculiar
circumstances.
so
that
even
the
first
circuit
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
government
on
san
geronimo
case,
admits
that
it
applies
only
with
our
peculiar
circumstances
justifying
the
government
to
try
a
title
in
a
case
--
try
a
title
of
the
condemnee
in
the
case.
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
dissent
in
the
turner
case,
that
was
a
split
decision,
which
i
would
like
to
read
if
i
may
out
of
page
five
of
our
brief.
now,
the
turner
case
was
subsequently,
as
i
mentioned
before,
overruled
by
u.s.
versus
11
acres
but
the
dissent
in
the
turner
case
at
page
five
stated
the
following.
“the
government
initially
set
out
towards
the
goal
of
acquiring
title
to
the
lands
by
a
condemnation
suit
but
now
has
reversed
the
field
and
is
trying
to
run
with
the
ball
in
the
opposite
direction.”
it's
assertion
that
it
does
not
now
want
condemnation
but
confirmation
of
a
title
that
it
already
owns
seems
to
me
to
be
so
utterly
and
violently
inconsistent
with
proceedings
and
eminent
domain
as
not
to
be
permissible.
and
that
is
exactly
how
the
court
of
appeals
below
felt
about
this
case.
they
were
the
two
judges,
judge
major
and
judge
schnackenberg
have
had
years
of
experience
with
condemnation
proceedings
in
the
state
courts.
as
soon
as
the
oral
arguments
started,
they
immediately
jumped
on
government
counsel
saying,
“how
can
you
adopt
such
an
inconsistent
procedure?”
it
is
inconsistent
with
everything
that
is
brought
up
in
--
in
condemnation
proceedings.
in
fact,
the
customary
jury
verdict
that
every
federal
court
in
the
land
uses
on
a
condemnation
case
merely
has
one
short
sentence,
“how
much
is
the
condemnee
entitled
to
receive
his
just
compensation?”
that
is
the
instruction
that
goes
out
in
every
condemnation
in
this
country.
and
that's
how
simple
--
that's
a
simple
basic
issue
in
an
orthodox
condemnation
proceeding.
well
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
pardon
me.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
your
honor.
that's
a
very
good
question
there.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
oh
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
not
explain
that.
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
there
are
maybe
10
or
15
people
asserting
title
to
the
same
land
in
the
proceeding.
well,
the
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
so
far
different
parts,
sir.
are
they
are
each
contesting
with
each
other?
so
if
there's
a
conflict
over
the
fund
that's
going
to
be
awarded.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there's
absolutely
no
problem
because
the
condemnation
proceeding
is
actually
instituting
--
there's
an
action
which
is
seizing
possession
of
somebody
and
the
only
question
is
one
of
title
so
you
really
have
an
orthodox
condemnation
proceeding
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
says.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
only
if
you
draw
the
analysis
from
the
other
situation,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
under
the
federal
statutes
i
will
mention
later
which
require
the
application
of
state
law.
under
the
fifth
circuit
case
that
i've
mentioned,
u.s.
versus
11
acres
as
against
an
individual
whom
that
government
is
trying
to
seek
title
from.
they
cannot
contest
their
title.
in
other
words,
if
i
claim
title,
and
let
us
talk
about
the
illinois
law
if
i
may
for
a
minute.
the
condemnor
has
before
acquiesces
under
illinois
law
in
the
condemnee's
title
by
the
mere
filing
of
the
condemnation
proceeding.
there's
no
way
in
the
world
that
the
condemnor
in
illinois
and
wisconsin
and
most
states
that
i
know
can
contest
title
of
the
condemnee.
now,
where
there
are
many
people
who
are
asserting
claims
for
--
the
just
asserting
the
title
to
the
lands
so
that
the
real
contest
is
not
whether
the
government
is
going
to
pay
for
that
land
that's
being
contended
but
who
gets
the
money
when
the
government
does
pay.
that's
a
completely
different
situation,
your
honor.
that
is
the
basis
of
our
whole
case
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
says.
in
other
words,
if
i
may
read
one
sentence
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
below's
decision
with
reference
to
the
cases
cited
by
the
government.
the
government
argues
that
claims
based
on
liens
or
contracts
may
be
settled
and
clouds
on
titles
resolved
in
condemnation
proceedings.
this
is
true,
no
doubt,
where
such
claims
or
rights
are
incidental
to
the
taking
of
property
for
which
just
compensation
is
to
be
awarded.
but
where
there
is
to
be
no
just
compensation
awarded
to
anybody,
whatsoever,
then
you
just
don't
have
a
condemnation
suit
because
a
condemnation
suit
necessarily
presupposes
under
the
statutes
of
--
setting
forth
what
is
condemnation.
presupposes
that
the
government
is
taking
by
force
something
which
they
can't
get
any
other
way
and
they're
paying
just
compensation
to
somebody
for
the
taking
of
their
property.
that
is
exactly
what
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes
sir,
your
honor.
there
has
to
be
a
taking
by
the
united
states
in
order
to
have
a
condemnation
proceeding.
that
is
the
fundamental
premise
of
our
case.
now,
there
has
to
be
a
taking
by
--
from
somebody.
now,
if
they're
not
taking
property
by
virtue
of
the
condemnation
proceeding,
then
they
are
not
taking
by
virtue
of
condemnation,
they're
taking
by
virtue
of
a
possessory
action
which
are
disguising
this
condemnation.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
there's
a
very
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well,
as
a
matter
of
justice,
i'm
very
happy
you
mentioned
because
this
is
really
what
the
crux
of
it
is,
is
the
justice
to
the
condemnee
and
to
the
courts.
if
the
procedure
followed
by
government
were
to
be
followed,
the
courts
would
be
burdened
with
unnecessary
litigation
which
just
makes
no
sense
at
all.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
and
--
and
the
condemnee
would
likewise
be
burdened.
for
example,
in
our
case,
that's
very
easily
to
understand
if
you
assume
--
well,
which
actually
happened.
as
soon
as
our
case
started,
the
government
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
our
answer
setting
up
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
and
was
overruled
by
the
court.
and
if
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
before
the
trial
had
been
granted,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
problem
actually
because
we'd
be
out
of
court
as
a
matter
of
law.
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
condemnation
trial.
but
because
we
won
on
the
question
of
our
lease
and
our
right
to
be
in
the
court,
we
had
to
go
through
an
eight
weeks
trial
of
a
condemnation
proceeding
which
is
a
proceeding
to
determine
the
value
of
the
property.
how
much
compensation
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well
this,
i
wish
they
had
honor
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
at
least
we
would
have
inverted
that.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
your
honor.
basically,
this
might
be
my
statement
of
the
case.
it
was
one
proviso
that
the
federal
statute
requires
that.
and
that
is
50
u.s.
v.
u.s.c.
171,
requires
the
application
of
the
federal
law
--
i
mean
of
the
state
law,
i'm
sorry.
and
in
illinois,
that
is
the
state
law
exactly
as
you
expressed
it.
now,
that
--
if
i
may
digress
and
get
back
to
the
hardship
later
because
i'm
not
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
find
an
answer
to
this
question.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
but,
your
honor,
50
u.s.c.,
the
federal
statute
requires
the
federal
courts
to
follow
the
state
procedures.
that
statute
has
been
construed
to
require
--
i
mean
there's
no
question
that
the
federal
courts
have
to
follow
it
under
that
statute,
and
that
statute
was
in
fact,
at
the
time
the
order
of
possession
was
entered
in
our
case
which
is
the
decisive
point.
even
the
government
concedes
that
--
in
its
brief
that
this
is
the
decisive
point
when
the
election
of
remedies
occurred
for
the
current
law,
was
when
we
were
deprived
of
our
property
irrevocably.
now
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well,
your
honor,
one
federal
statute
is
cited
which
purports
to
say
that.
that
statute,
i
don't
think
is
involved
in
this
case
often,
i
don't
recall
but
it
isn't
--
that
isn't
50
u.s.c.
section
171.
it
isn't
the
basic
statute
which
--
upon
which
the
complaint
was
filed.
now,
what
this
other
statute
says
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
but
aside
from
that,
even
that
statute
that
counsel
talks
about,
is
talking
about
quieting
title
where
there
are
may
be
16
different
people
claiming
for
the
same
amount
of
money.
that's
not
our
situation.
(voive
overlap)
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
for
same
piece
of
land.
that's
what
all
the
statutes
is
really
talking
about,
the
same
with
rule
71a
when
it
talks
about
various
people
be
enjoined
as
parties
wholly
frequently
in
these
cases,
you
may
have
a
hundred
people.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
because
the
government
is
condemning
an
interest
in
the
land
and
is
paying
somebody
some
money
for
it
and
therefore,
it
is
not
electing
any
remedy
in
a
sense
in
our
case
where
they're
--
they're
contesting
our
title.
and
the
cases
your
talking
about,
your
honor,
the
government
admits
that
there's
always
for
somebody,
admits
that
the
title
is
not
in
the
government.
the
condemnation
proceeding
must
go
ahead
in
order
to
get
the
title
to
the
government
and
the
government
is
willing
to
pay
the
money.
that
isn't
our
situation.
in
our
case,
the
government
is
saying
that
they
--
that
we
shouldn't
be
paid
anything
because
our
lease
was
cancelled.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
but
what
it's
trying
to
do
is
decide
the
legal
question
of
whether
it
owes
us
any
money
in
the
condemnation
proceeding.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
what
i
would
like
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that
is
right.
now,
if
i
may
elaborate
on
that,
your
honor.
in
this
case
before
the
government
filed
this
condemnation
proceeding,
we
are
anxious
to
have
this
matter
determined,
the
lease
question
determined
and
we
file
suit
in
the
federal
court
for
declaratory
judgment
action
hoping
that
the
government
would
come
in
and
join
with
us
a
summary
proceeding
which
would
of
course
is
very
little.
we
could
have
litigated
the
matter
of
in
that
proceeding.
there,
it
was
simply
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
they
never
offered
to
--
we
would
have
been
glad
to
let
them
take
possession
if
it
was
possible
to
work
it
out
through
the
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
but
they
never
asked
us.
instead,
they
asserted
their
immunity
to
sue.
we
had
to
dismiss
our
declaratory
action
and
they
immediately
filed
a
condemnation
suit.
so
we
did
everything
in
the
world
to
try
and
get
a
summary
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
because
the
government
asserted
its
immunity
to
sue.
they
said
you
can't
sue
uncle
sam
and
we
agreed
we
couldn't.
we
hope
that
they'd
join
in.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
because
the
government
refused
to
litigate
the
matter
in
a
summary
problem.
that's
one
of
the
unconscionable
things
about
this
case.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that's
right.
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
i
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
i
agree.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
i
agree,
your
honor.
i'm
merely
trying
to
explain
that
we
did
everything
we
could
to
get
a
summary
inexpensive
adjudication
to
the
problem.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
correct.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
now,
there's
two
basic
reasons
why
we
think
it's
unjust
to
follow
the
condemnor's
position
in
this
case,
number
one
is
the
50
u.s.c.
171
expressly
provides
that
the
federal
court
shall
follow
the
state
law.
now,
the
government
argues
that
rule
71a
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
institution
of
the
condemnation
suit
which
is
a
decisive
factor
when
the
order
of
possession
was
entered,
and
they
argue
from
that
that
rule
71
overcame
the
statute.
well
actually,
rule
71a
is
merely
a
procedural
device.
it's
merely
our
--
just
as
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
stated,
merely
pertains
to
a
procedure.
it
does
not
apply
to
substantive
law.
and
the
government
admits
in
its
brief
that
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
is
a
substantive
matter
because
it's
substantially
affects
the
rights
of
the
government
if
you
bar
the
government
from
having
the
right
to
contest
title
in
condemnation.
now,
if
it
is
a
substantive
matter,
obviously,
rule
71a
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
substantive
provisions
of
50
u.s.c.
171.
those
still
remain
in
effect
and
under
those
substantive
provisions,
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
precludes
the
government
and
under
illinois
law
and
federal
courts
from
contesting
our
title.
this
is
just
clear
cut
and
the
government
has
not
answered
this
in
their
oral
argument
or
in
their
briefs.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
illinois,
your
honor,
if
you
go
in
at
all,
you've
elected
your
remedy
if
you're
the
condemnor
and
you're
bound
to
acquiesce
--
acquiesce
in
the
interest
which
the
condemnee
have.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
absolutely,
your
honor,
by
a
condemnation
suit
and
it's
the
same
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
in
wisconsin.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
same
in
wisconsin.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
oh,
before,
that
suits
your
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well,
couldn't
possibly.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
i
said,
to
your
honor,
the
rule
71a
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
case
because
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
is
a
substantive
matter.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well,
election
of
remedies
is
not
a
procedure,
your
honor.
that's
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
the
facts
of
the
issue.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well,
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well
only
--
there's
only
one
step
in
the
sense
of
legal
proceedings
but
of
course,
the
state
or
whoever
is
condemning
looks
ahead
and
sees
alone
as
a
property
before
they
condemn.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
before
filing
a
suit.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
if
there's
no
illinois
statute?
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
well,
this
is
illinois
common
law
as
well
as
statutory,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
you
have
to
follow
the
wyoming
law,
your
honor.
under
the
--
under
the
federal
statute,
you
have
to
follow
whatever
the
wyoming
law
was.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
oh,
if
they
don't
have
it,
if
--
then
you
have
to
follow
whatever
they've
got
not
just
start
our
--
i
mean
illinois,
you
--
the
federal
courts
in
illinois
would
follow
the
illinois
law.
in
wyoming,
they
follow
the
wyoming
law.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that
rule
7
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
that
is
correct,
your
honor
for
this
reason.
the
notes
of
the
advisory
committee
on
the
rules
cited
at
page
9
of
our
brief
specifically
say
that
the
substantive
portions
of
50
u.s.
171
were
not
repealed
by
rule
71a.
the
only
portions
of
50
u.s.c.
171
which
were
repealed
are
affected
by
rule
71a
with
the
procedural
aspects
of
50
u.s.c.
171.
now,
the
only
way
this
argument
can
be
compared
to
this
to
come
up
and
say
that
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
is
a
procedural
device
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
and
not
a
substantive
matter.
but
the
government
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
your
--
oh
no,
t's
been
changed
because
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
it
might
still
be
the
law.
that
gets
us
involved
in
the
title
10
and
other
things
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
your
honor.
we're
caught
up
in
a
lot
of
statutes
there.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
your
honor
because
i
don't
think
--
if
you're
referring
to
the
1958
amendment,
it's
on
title
10.
there
has
nothing
to
argue
with
the
case
and
we
concede
that
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
with
10
u.s.c.
we've
never
taken
it.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
i
believe
you
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
congress,
maybe
not
understands
it
but
if
we
once
assume
that
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies
is
a
substantive
matter,
then
there's
no
way
in
the
world
of
saying
that
rule
71a
changes
that
old
law.
now,
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
they
did
repeal
10
u.s.c.
and
10
u.s.c.
repealed
50
u.c.s.
so
therefore,
there
is
no
50
u.s.c.
or
10
u.s.c.
to
rely
upon
today.
so
you
--
the
answer
is
that
there
isn't
any
48th
state
law
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
but
that
it's
not
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
no,
they
could
have,
sir,
they
could
have.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
as
at
the
time
of
our
case,
they
haven't.
ours
was
decided
in
1954
before
10
u.s.c.
was
even
enacted
and
that
is
--
and
1958,
of
course,
would
have
no
effect
upon
what
happened
back
in
1954.
our
trial
was
in
1954,
your
honor.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
since
1954.
yes,
sir.
we've
been
fighting
all
the
way
from
the
supreme
court.
and
we've
been
successful
all
the
way,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
just
mentioned
that
because
it
brings
up
the
next
point,
if
i
may
go
into
the
question
of
hardship.
now,
we
tried
to
get
a
summary
judgment
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
oh,
this
will
be
just
one
second,
your
honor,
to
find
--
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
--
and
indulge
--
i
need
just
one
second
because
this
is
important
to
answer.
mr.
leonard
r.
hartenfeld
now,
because
we
won
the
lawsuit
below,
we
had
to
go
through
this
tremendous
eight-day
condemnation
proceeding
trial
evaluation.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
says
that
our
case
was
the
most
complicated
valuation
question
in
the
history
of
all
the
law
books.
this
is
really
a
state,
when
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
had
to
go
through
that
for
eight
days,
answer
all
kinds
of
complicated
questions
of
law
in
fact
with
appraisers
and
all
the
kinds
of
expenses
to
try
the
question
of
value.
and
yet,
even
today,
we
don't
know
if
were
entitled
of
the
kind.
and
likewise,
the
trial
court
had
to
spend
eight
days
of
its
time
closing
of
this
case
and
the
trial
court
doesn't
know
if
it
hasn't
wasted
its
time.
that
is
why
we
say
there's
a
hardship
on
the
court
and
on
the
litigants
also
to
follow
this
theory
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
felt,
too.
the
--
if
i
may
have
just
one
sentence
more,
your
honor,
i
hate
to
overindulge
in
this
but
under
our
theory,
the
scope
of
--
of
election
of
remedies
would
wipe
out
any
claim
by
the
government
as
to
the
statutory
power
to
lease
or
this
--
or
the
intention
of
the
parties
in
drafting
the
lease.
and
we
say
that
because
under
the
illinois
which
is
effective
law
and
which
is
effective
here,
the
condemnee
concedes
the
full
title
of
the
condemnee
--
the
condemnor
concedes
the
full
title
of
the
condemnee
by
merely
filing
the
condemnation
suit.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
addition.
