how
about
the
seizure?
don't
--
doesn't
the
government
have
power
to
seize
and
then
relegate
the
alleged
donor
to
a
claim
of
the
court
of
claims?
justice
potter
stewart
no
better
off
but
there's
no
question
of
that
power,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
you're
misdirecting
my
question.
do
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
thought
that
you
had
a
hobson's
choice,
i'm
suggesting
that
there
was
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
that
likelihood
is
rather
small
particularly
after
it
had
been
used
for
some
other
purpose,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
was
before
the
jury,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
was
before
the
jury
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
about
the
nike
base.
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury
was
told
about
the
lease
and
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
construed
the
meaning
of
the
lease
as
a
matter
of
law
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
instructed
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
the
statement
that
i
have
understood
previously,
i
have
understood
previously
that
the
jury
--
that
the
--
that
the
trial
judge
kept
in
the
jury
any
knowledge
of
this
nike
business.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
--
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
--
going
to
the
question
of
value
of
the
property
that
the
government
had
power
edge
(inaudible)
who
cancelled
the
lease
only
for
use
for
naval
aviation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
a
time
when
the
jury
was
fully
aware
that
the
use
was
not
going
to
be
for
naval
aviation,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
really,
there
was
no
real
purpose
in
giving
that
instruction
as
to
evaluation
of
the
trial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
mr.
hartenfeld
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
government
condemnation
proceedings
have
been
utilized
quite
frequently
for
the
very
purpose
of
--
of
clearing
title
and
quieting
title.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
complaint
because
each
claims
ownership
to
the
land?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
--
how
was
--
except
the
degree
is
that
different
from
this
case?
it
does
