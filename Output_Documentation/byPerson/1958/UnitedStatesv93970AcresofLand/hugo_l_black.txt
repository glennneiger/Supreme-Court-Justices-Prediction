was
there
a
national
emergency
at
the
time
it
was
revoked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
suggesting
that
we
dismiss
that
it
was
(inaudible)
granted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
said
are
you
suggesting
that
we
dismiss
that
it
was
(inaudible)
granted
because
it's
trivial
and
it
only
involves
a
little
money
between
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
the
kind
of
case
that
we
should
leave
to
the
experienced
judges
below
on
determining
that
question
of
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
should
adopt
your
viewpoint,
would
that
dispose
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
say
so
far
as
the
--
if
we
dispose
of
--
if
we
said
that
clear
that
the
court
had
decided
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
parties
intended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
all
the
contract
did
not
authorize
revocation
for
this
record.
could
that
be
in
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
fundamentally
is
wrong
with
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
matter
of
the
justice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
you
had
not
done
that
and
the
government
had
just
sued
you
to
acquire
a
title?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
have
--
it
might
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
have
done.
what
--
what
you're
saying
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
under
the
law
or
as
justice
requires
as
a
very
--
government
had
mostly
condemned
property,
it's
not
absolutely
sure
whether
someone
else
has
an
outstanding
interest
or
title,
there
might
be
cloud.
the
government
would
first
have
to
remove
the
could
on
title
and
then
bring
an
action
to
condemnation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
okay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
illinois
wants
to
have
that
as
its
condemnation
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
admits
that
it
may
owed
you
by
filing
a
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
that
is
unjust?
justice
hugo
l.
black
thus,
interpreting
to
the
fair
rules.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
government
had
taken
possession
of
this
property
which
it
claimed
was
needed,
during
that
time?
