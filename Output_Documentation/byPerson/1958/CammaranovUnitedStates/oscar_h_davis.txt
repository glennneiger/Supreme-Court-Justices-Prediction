mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
arising
under
the
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
it
is
not
a
case
involving
prohibition
or
direct
restriction
of
any
kind
upon
the
use
of
advertising
in
political
campaigns.
and
as
a
income
tax
case,
as
what
most
income
tax
cases,
it
comes
here
with
a
great
long
history
which
i
believe
has
not
been
fully
opened
to
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
summarize
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
the
four
factors
which
we
believe
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
and
which
lead
inevitably
in
our
view
to
a
conclusion
opposed
to
that
advanced
by
colonel
reiner
--
wiener.
the
first
factor
is
the
statutory
term
"ordinary
and
necessary."
when
this
--
when
that
term
first
came
before
this
court,
justice
--
or
not
first
--
in
the
classic
case
in
which
it
came
before
the
court,
justice
cardozo
said
it
doesn't
impose
a
rule
of
law
or
a
verbal
formula.
he
called
it
a
way
of
life
in
fact.
and
in
the
textile
mills
case
to
which
colonel
wiener
referred,
the
court
ref
--
said
it's
certainly
not
clear
and
unambiguous.
the
words
are
general,
indefinite,
imprecise.
and
because
they
are
general,
definite
--
indefinite
and
imprecise,
they
are
capable
of
specific
diminution
through
the
course
of
years
by
judicial
decision,
by
regulation
and
that
is
what
has
happened.
they're
not
only
capable
and
susceptible
of
that,
that
has
been
the
course
of
history
under
this
regulation.
if
i
may
use
an
analogy
from
the
sherman
act,
i
don't
--
the
sherman
act
uses
the
general
expression
contract
in
--
in
restraint
of
trade.
now
today,
we
don't
look
at
--
at
a
particular
case
before
the
court
and
decide
whether
fresh
de
novo,
looking
at
it
as
a
matter
of
dictionary
definition
a
particular
contract
or
combination
isn't
restraint
of
trade
--
trade
because
various
per
se
rules
of
law
had
been
developed
over
the
years
such
as
a
--
a
combination
to
fix
prices
is
a
perceived
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
well
similarly
in
--
in
this
field,
the
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses,
certain
rules
of
law
have
been
developed
over
the
years
and
one
rule
of
law
that
has
been
developed
both
by
regulation
and
by
judicial
decision
is
that
you
cannot
deduct
as
a
business
expense
these
expenditures
for
advertising
and
publicity
campaigns
for
the
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation.
now,
about
the
statutory
terms,
more
than
unnecessary,
i'd
like
to
say
just
two
other
things.
one
is
that
they
do
not
cover
capital
expenses.
justice
cardozo
also
said
that
there
are
many
necessary
payments
which
are
capital
charges
and
therefore
not
deductible
under
this
phrase.
and
the
last
thing
i'd
like
to
say
about
the
statute
is
that
it's
recently
as
the
sullivan
case
at
--
handed
down
by
this
court
last
term,
the
court
said
that
deductions
are
a
matter
of
grace
and
you
have
to
fall
within
the
statutory
terms
as
they
have
been
interpreted
over
the
years.
now
the
important
thing
in
this
case
is
the
regulation.
the
regulation
to
which
colonel
wiener
has
adverted.
i
will
--
i
hope
to
go
into
that
at
greater
length.
what
i
want
to
say
in
the
beginning
is
this
is
not
a
--
a
baby
infant
regulation
untested
in
the
courts
which
comes
here
for
the
first
time.
this
is
a
regulation
which
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
income
tax
act.
the
first
income
tax
act
under
the
sixteenth
amendment
was
passed
in
1913.
in
1915,
the
commissioner
published
a
regulation
or
published
a
decision
in
which
he
said
that
lobbying
expenses
and
campaign
contributions
are
not
deductible
as
business
expenses.
that
was
not
a
regulation,
it
was
a
decision.
but
in
1918,
still
under
the
original
1913
act,
he
published
the
regulation
which
is
identical
with
the
regulation
which
is
in
effect
today,
or
the
regulation
which
was
in
effect
at
that
time
the
--
this
case
--
this
case
and
the
succeeding
case
arose.
he
added
to
the
phrases
lobbying
and
contribution
of
campaign
expenses,
the
two
phrases
"promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation"
and
the
"exploitation
of
propaganda"
including
advertising
other
than
trade
advertising.
so
the
regulation
comes
down
to
us
from
1918
issued
successively
under
the
various
--
various
income
tax
acts
that
have
been
passed.
there
had
been
13
re-issuances
of
this
regulation
under
each
of
the
income
tax
act
that
was
--
have
been
enacted
since
1918.
so,
it
is
a
regulation
that
comes
down
to
us
with
not
only
the
commissioner's
sanction
behind
it
but
with
the
rule
of
this
court
relating
to
reenactment
and
congressional
acquiescence
in
federal
income
tax
regulations.
then
there
are
--
the
third
factor
i'd
like
to
mention
are
the
judicial
decisions.
there
is
the
textile
mills
decision
of
this
court
in
1941,
almost
17
years
ago
which
we
believe
is
almost
wholly,
almost
but
not
quite
because
it
didn't
deal
with
an
initiative.
but
otherwise,
we
believe
it's
wholly
dispositive
of
this
--
of
this
case.
and
then
that
decision
from
1941
on
has
been
generally
followed
in
the
tax
court
and
in
the
courts
of
appeals
so
that
i
think
i
can
fairly
say,
leaving
out
for
one
moment
the
luther
ely
smith
case
to
which
the
tax
court
case
to
which
colonel
wiener
referred.
i
think
that
--
with
that
possible
exception
which
i
do
not
think
is
an
exception
but
with
that
--
leaving
that
aside,
there
is
no
dispute
or
conflict
among
the
circuits
or
the
tax
court
that
this
kind
of
expenditure
for
publicity
cam
--
campaign
to
promote
or
defeat
legislation
is
not
deductible
under
the
regulation
on
the
statute.
and
finally,
the
fourth
factor
that
i'd
like
to
mention
is
the
congressional
policy.
i
have
already
referred
to
the
--
the
constant
reenactment
of
this
--
of
the
income
tax
act
in
the
light
of
this
continuing
regulation.
mr.
justice
whittaker
adverted
to
the
specific
enactments
by
congress
with
relations
to
--
with
relation
to
charitable
contribution
and
ex
--
exemption
of
charitable
organizations.
and
then
there
is
--
the
further
fact
that
i
would
like
to
mention
preliminary
and
that
is,
that
this
is
not
a
--
what
shall
i
say
a
capricious
or
arbitrary
determination
by
congress
and
congress'
delegate
the
commissioner
acting
together.
there
is
a
very
decided
public
policy
behind
--
behind
this
regulation.
and
that
public
policy
also
adverted
to
i
believe
in
a
question
by
the
chief
justice
is
the
--
is
the
policy
of
tax
equilibrium
that
the
federal
fist
for
treasury
will
stand
apart
from
all
--
from
attempts
to
defeat
or
promote
legislation,
that
either
businessmen
or
non-businessmen
who
seek
to
have
legislation
change
will
have
to
bear
the
entire
burden
of
their
own
expenses.
that
is
the
policy
which
has
been
properly
referred
to
as
the
policy
of
tax
equilibrium.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
no
it's
a
--
it's
a
financial
matter
that
the
--
the
federal
government
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
but
it
has
to
do
with
both
sides
in
a
--
in
a
controversy.
take
this
initiative
before
the
state
of
washington.
it
was
supported
by
the
--
the
beer
wholesalers
and
the
wine
wholesalers,
restaurants,
groceries
and
so
forth.
it
was
opposed
by
the
temperance
people
and
they
formed
a
committee.
now
the
temperance
people,
if
they
had
advertising,
would
not
get
a
deduction
because
it
would
not
be
part
of
any
business
of
which
they
--
of
which
they
were
carrying
on.
they
would
have
to
bear
the
full
100%
dollar
cost
of
all
the
publicity
that
they
issued
in
the
course
of
their
campaign.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
congress
has
indicated
--
congress
has
indicated
that
if
u.s.
steel
gives
--
gives
a
contribution
to
a
charity
which
is
engaged
substantially
in
propaganda
for
the
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation,
it
cannot
deduct
it.
so
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
congress
has
been
particularly
interested.
congress
has
--
congress
and
the
commissioner
working
together,
i
think
that
the
analogy
i
would
use
is
of
a
tree
and
a
vine,
a
vine
having
really
become
part
of
the
tree
in
the
course
of
the
40
years
since
this
regulation
was
first
promulgated,
that
the
policy
here
is
that
in
the
field
of
a
electoral
matters,
in
the
field
of
legislation,
in
that
particular
field,
the
federal
treasury
should
stay
aside.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
issue
is
a
--
is
a
novel
issue.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
the
background
is
not
novel,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
may
be
so.
well,
i
would
try
to
explain
it
on
the
course
of
my
argument,
that
is
not
so,
that
the
same
factors
apply.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
leonard
smith
case.
that
was
a
decision
in
1944.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
that
--
that's
right.
we
think
that
the
decision
is
clearly
distinguishable.
we
also
think
it
is
wrong.
those
are
two
separate
arguments.
that
this
--
that
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
there's
a
difference,
mr.
justice
stewart
between
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
between
a
single
decision
of
the
tax
court.
in
fact
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
this
court
indicated
in
the
glenshaw
glass
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
that
the
reenactment
doctrine
doesn't
apply
to
a
single
decision
of
the
tax
court.
a
difference
between
that
and
the
consistent
history
of
--
of
regulations
that
you
have
here.
but
relate
--
with
relations
to
the
luther
ely
smith
case,
i
would
say
this,
one
is,
it
related
to
a
constitutional
provision
of
the
missouri
constitution.
and
the
tax
court
went
on
that
ground.
it
says
that
it
was
a
self-operating
constitutional
provision
of
the
missouri
constitution.
we
do
not
have
here
a
constitutional
provision.
this
was
an
initiative
which
is
going
to
become
a
statute
of
the
state
of
washington.
so
there
is
a
--
there
is
that
distinction
between
a
constitutional
provision
and
then
--
and
a
--
and
a
statute.
the
tax
court
itself
in
later
decisions,
applied
its
--
it's
--
the
other
rule,
the
rule
in
which
we
advocate
to
referenda
and
--
and
initiatives.
in
fact,
it
even
applied
it
to
a
constitutional
provision
of
the
state
of
kansas
which
brings
me
to
my
second
point
that
the
luther
ely
case
--
excuse
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
don't
think
it
is
and
that's
why
i
think
the
decision
is
wrong,
mr.
justice
[laughter]
whittaker.
but
i
will
--
i
will
think
--
i
will
say
that's
the
distinction
which
the
tax
court
thought
was
the
--
was
the
appropriate
one.
and
that
is
why
the
commissioner
finally
was
convinced
that
he
ought
to
withdraw
his
acquiescence
from
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
he
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
--
there
are
two
different
passage.
leaving
aside
the
initiative,
i'm
saying
that
there's
been
congressional
acquiescence
in
the
general
part
of
the
regulation
which
deals
with
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
colonel
wiener
did
and
that's
what
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
he
--
he
had
two
arguments.
he
--
his
first
argument
was
that
the
only
part
of
the
statute
which
was
valid
was
the
lobbying,
the
direct
lobbying
but
that
any
publicity
campaign
as
in
the
textile
mills
case
for
the
promotion
of
defeat
of
--
of
legislation
enacted
by
a
--
a
legislature
could
be
still
deducted
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
was
done
in
the
--
in
the
textile
mills
case
which
i
would
like
to
--
to
go
into
a
greater
detail.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
would
do
it
right
now,
mr.
justice,
because
i
--
as
i
say
we
stand
in
large
measure
on
that
case.
that
case
did
not
involve
direct
lobbying.
that
case
did
not
involve
any
approaches
to
legislatures
at
all.
what
happened
there
was
that
the
textile
mills
corporation
was
a
company
which
engaged
to
--
to
put
on
a
publicity
campaign
in
order
to
secure
the
return
of
assets
which
had
been
invested
during
the
world
war
i
to
--
by
--
enemy
alien
assets
which
have
invested.
the
textile
mills
company
hired
the
famous
publicist
ivy
lee
to
put
on
a
publicity
campaign
and
they
hired
two
lawyers
to
write
law
review
articles
without
disclosing
the
--
the
personal
interest
of
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
of
the
company.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
we
have
here
too.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
was
very
so.
the
--
but
there
was
no
direct
approach
to
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
to
the
congress
in
any
way.
it
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
didn't
talk
to
congressmen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
law
review
articles
were
--
were
directed
to
the
general
public.
the
--
there
were
no
--
they
were
directed
to
the
public
in
the
sense
that
the
lawyers
and
other
people
interested.
they
weren't
directed
to
the
congressmen
directly.
and
the
case
came
here
on
that
basis
and
the
court
decided
that
this
regulation
which
--
which
i'm
talking
apply
and
was
valid.
and
so
we
have
there,
we
think
the
--
at
least
this
much
of
this
case.
we
have
a
general
publicity
campaign,
ivy
lee
and
legislation,
the
settlement
of
war
claims
act
which
returned
the
--
enemy
alien
assets
to
germans.
and
the
court
held
not
this
--
that
this
was
nondeductible
because
it
was
illegal.
it
said
specifically
we
--
it
--
it's
a
material
whether
it
was
illegal
that
the
regulation
was
properly
adopted
by
the
commissioner,
and
the
regulation
covers
this
situation.
so,
it
carried
this,
i
say
this
far.
it
carries
us
to
a
publicity
campaign
such
as
we
have
here
and
it
carries
us
to
a
statute.
it
does
not
carry
--
carry
us
to
the
initiative
but
it
does
carry
us
beyond
the
button
holding
problem
with
--
which
--
on
which
colonel
wiener
rested
part
of
his
case.
now,
if
i
can
return
for
a
moment
to
the
--
the
luther
ely
smith
case
about
which
you
questioned
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
tax
court
itself
made
that
distinction.
i
agree
with
you,
the
commissioner
now
agree
with
you
that
that
is
not
much
of
a
distinction
but
the
tax
court
thought
it
was
because
it
applied
it
only
in
the
case
of
a
constitutional
amendment.
it
continued
to
apply
the
regulation
in
cases
relating
to
initiatives
and
in
cases
relating
to
publicity
campaigns
relating
to
acts
of
state
legislatures
or
--
or
of
congress.
so
the
tax
court
thought
that
was
the
distinction,
a
--
a
self-operating
provision
of
this
--
of
the
constitution.
the
reason
why
the
commissioner
acquiesced
because
at
that
time
he
thought
that
was
a
proper
distinction.
he
had
seen
the
light.
he
withdrew
his
acquiescence
because
it
was
thought
that
it
would
be
embarrassing
to
us
to
come
up
here
and
have
to
defend
both
throngs
of
the
--
of
the
situation
in
which
it
would
--
because
there
was
no
sound
distinction
between
the
two
just
as
you
pointed
out.
but
i
do
think
that
this
much
is
true
that
these
petitioners
and
other
similarly
situated
could
not
properly
rest
on
the
luther
ely
smith
case
because
they
don't
have
a
case
involving
a
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
but
the
--
that's
the
distinction
which
the
tax
court
itself
made
in
--
in
other
cases
that
have
--
that
have
gone
on.
since
1944,
there
have
been
at
least
two,
maybe
three
cases
by
the
tax
court
in
which
they
themselves
did
not
apply
the
luther
ely
smith
case
to
an
initiative,
in
fact,
to
this
initiative
in
another
earlier
case,
and
to
a
canvas
situation
so
that
whatever
the
rightness
or
the
wrongness,
and
i
think
it
is
wrong,
these
petitioners
had
no
right
to
rely
upon
it.
as
far
as
congressional
reenactment,
there
has
been
no
congressional
reenactment
relating
to
them
since
the
--
the
luther
ely
smith
--
luther
ely
smith
case
came
down
in
1944,
date
here
was
1948
and
there
was
no
statute
in
between
1944
and
1948.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
and
it
did.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
not
many.
one
is
the
tax
court
case
in
the
companion
case,
the
strauss
case
which
is
a
--
which
is
a
initiative
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
then
there
was
case
in
the
tax
court
involving
this
same
initiative
in
the
state
of
washington
in
the
mcclintock-trunkey
case
cited
in
our
brief.
and
then
there
is
the
tax
court
case
involving
a
kansas
--
in
fact
it's
a
kansas
constitutional
amendment,
the
moseley
hotel
case.
there
are
three
tax
court
cases
involving
--
in
addition
to
the
luther
ely
smith
case,
involving
the
problem
of
referendum
initiative
of
votes
by
the
people
on.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
moseley
case
was
the
--
was
the
--
an
amendment
to
the
kansas
constitution.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
when?
1954.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
another
ground
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
a
--
this
issue
was
not
taken
to
the
--
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
now,
let
me
go
at
once
to
the
congressional
policy
which
is
probably
at
the
heart
of
--
of
this
case.
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
congress
in
1934
to
1936
adopted
two
provisions
which
we
believe
have
a
bearing.
one
is
the
provision
which
mr.
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
referred
to,
forbidding
the
deduction
of
contributions
to
charitable
organizations
of
those
charitable
organizations
engaged
in
propaganda
to
promote
or
defeat
legislations.
the
second
provision
was
a
provision
saying
that
charitable
organizations
which
engaged
in
that
kind
of
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation
would
no
longer
be
tax
exempt.
now,
these
two
legislative
provisions
i
think
are
clear
indication
that
congress
does
not
want
federal
subvention,
federal
support,
federal
subsidy
for
the
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation.
and
this
general
policy
was
foreshadowed
in
the
decision
by
justice
--
judge
learned
hand
in
1930
in
the
slee
case,
s-l-e-e,
that
involves
the
american
birth
control
league,
involved
the
contributions
of
the
birth
control
league.
and
the
second
circuit
court
consisting
of
judge
hand,
judge
mack
and
judge
chase
refused
to
allow
the
charitable
deduction
even
though
at
that
time
there
was
no
such
statutory
provision,
just
came
in
to
the
statute
later.
at
that
time,
it
was
simply
a
provision
for
deduction
for
charitable
contributions.
judge
hand
said
as
mr.
wiener
has
referred
to
and
i
--
in
alignment
to
that,
i'd
like
to
reach
the
court.
political
agitation
as
such
is
outside
the
statute,
that
is
outside
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
however
innocent
the
aim
though
--
though
it
had
nothing
to
doubt
--
to
doubt
a
propaganda
which
is
a
polemical
word
used
to
describe
a
publicity
of
the
other
side.
controversies
of
that
sort
much
be
conducted
without
public
subventions.
the
treasury
stands
aside
from
that.
that
we
think
is
the
basis
of
the
--
of
the
entire
policy
of
this
regulation
and
of
the
statute
which
congress
has
enacted.
let
me
--
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
if
i
may
how
our
view
which
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
is
the
prevailing
view
works
in
this
situation.
petitioners
--
mr.
wiener's
client
and
other
similar
situated
can
certainly
go
out
and
spend
money
for
a
publicity
campaign
to
defeat
this
initiative
in
the
state
of
washington.
they
are
certainly
free
to
do
that
within
the
limits
of
federal
and
state
legislation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
mean
if
there
are
--
if
they
may
--
maybe
limits
on
the
amount
--
on
--
on
the
amount
of
expenditures.
i
--
i
just
want
to
leave
that
issue
out
of
the
case
because
it
isn't
here.
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
--
i
do
not
because
we
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
it
exists
in
this
case
and
i
--
i
don't
have
time
to
--
to
go
into
it
at
length
but
the
--
we
have
printed
it
in
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
record
the
various
or
selection
from
the
various
advertisements
which
are
published.
the
thing
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
is
that
nowhere,
nowhere
and
this
is
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
isn't
indicated
that
the
people
who
are
publishing
these
advertisements
are
really
the
beer
and
wine
wholesalers
in
the
state
0of
washington.
it
is
put
out
under
the
title,
men
and
women
against
prohibition
with
an
executive
secretary's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
names
and
so
forth.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
believe
you
do,
mr.
justice.
what
i'm
saying
--
no.
but
they
--
they
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
they
--
they
published
--
they
were
the
--
the
publishers
of
these
advertisements
in
reality.
they
did
not
put
their
names
to
it.
they
did
not
indicate
to
the
people
of
washington
that
they
--
the
liquor
interests
were
opposing
the
state
initiative.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
made
it
appear
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
concealed
their
interests.
they
--
they
made
it
appear
that
they
were
the
--
“the
men
and
women
against
--
of
washington
against
prohibition."
as
if
they
were
a
--
an
organization
of
disinterested
organization
and
their
advertisements
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
don't
condemn
it
as
reprehensible
but
i
condemn
it
as
--
with
it
--
i
--
i
state
that
it
was
with
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
is
--
it
is
within
the
--
the
thing
with
which
congress
has
always
been
concerned
that
is
advertising
in
electoral
campaigns
which
does
not
reveal
the
source
of
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
carries
partially
within.
it
is
not
as
bad
as
lobbying
in
the
old-fashioned
sense
but
it
carries
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
yes,
it
carries
within
it
the
same
refined
--
the
refined
idealist
sense,
exactly
that
because
what
--
what
happens
is
that
a
large
amount
of
money
is
spent
for
some
advertising,
some
of
which
is
quite
lurid.
there
are
pictures
of
some
of
which
i
think
can
fairly
be
said
to
be
cut.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
i
mean
this
--
this
is
--
this
is
the
idealist
sense.
advertising
which
it
--
the
source
of
which
is
concealed
from
the
general
public
of
the
state
of
washington
so
that
the
public
has
no
means
of
evaluating
the
interests
of
the
writ
of
the
publisher
of
the
advertisement.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
no
indication
that
it's
these
people.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
--
as
colonel
wiener
says
they
might
just
have
been
people
who
like
taverns.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
suggestion
is
that
--
that
these
were
the
brewers
or
--
or
the
wholesalers
and
that
they
did
not
reveal
their
interests.
the
second
point
i
have
to
make
on
this
issue
is
that
there
is
a
degree
of
personal
solicitation.
you
will
see
in
these
advertisements
as
in
the
companion
case
lists
of
people
of
the
state
of
washington
who
support
these
advertisements.
now
these
people
didn't
arise
out
of
the
blue.
they
were
solicited.
people
--
in
fact
the
--
the
records
shows
that
on
--
on
the
--
the
trust
fund,
the
beer
wholesalers'
trust
fund
which
published
this
advertisement
on
behalf
of
these
taxpayers
and
other
similarly
situated
had
field
men
who
apparently
went
out
and
collected
names
or
--
or
got
people
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
who
had
agreed
to
do
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
have
the
deductibility
of
the
advertisements
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
that
all
--
of
all
the
expenses,
yes,
we
have
all
the
expenses
including
--
you
see,
these
people
made
a
contribution
to
a
trust
fund.
the
trust
fund
paid
all
these
expenses
so
they
--
they
have
a
pro
rata
share
of
all
the
expenses
of
the
trust
fund.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh
yes.
i
don't
deny
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
on
the
first
half
of
your
--
of
your
statement
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
i
agree
perfectly.
they
have
the
right
to
it
--
to
address
--
address
the
public.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
it
will
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
reason
why
it
should
be
denied
the
quality
of
a
business
expense,
in
addition
to
the
history
which
i
have
--
have
in
mind
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
policy
of
tax
equilibrium
that
the
brewers
and
the
wholesalers
should
not
get
a
business
expense
where
the
temperance
--
temperance
advocates
would
not.
particularly
since
the
brewers
will
be
able
to
spend
more
money
on
this
--
on
this
basis
being
wealthier
organizations
and
--
and
the
graduated
income
tax
will
allow
them
to
really
pay
only
perhaps
52%
of
the
cost
of
all
these
advertising
whereas
the
temperance
advocates,
the
people
on
the
other
side
will
have
to
bear
100%
of
the
cost
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
--
that
is
–-
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
maybe
true
and
i
would
not
say
that
congress
couldn't
adopt
the
other
view.
my
position
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
did
but
they
--
congress
has
also
acquiesced
as
this
court
has
said
several
times,
acquiesced
over
a
long
period
of
years
in
a
--
in
a
regulation
which
says
gladly
that
if
you
expend
money
for
the
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation
--
legislation,
you
cannot
deduct
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
now
that
--
that
this
court
has
never
decided.
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh
--
oh,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
well,
i
--
it
had
decided.
it
is
clear
that
initiative
in
referendum
are
legislation
in
the
general
sense.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
cases
from
the
supreme
court
of
california,
washington,
north
dakota
which
makes
it
very
clear
that
on
--
in
those
days
and
i
presume
this
is
true
generally
of
initiative
in
referendum
states
that
initiative
in
referendum
aside
from
constitutional
amendments
are
ordinary
legislation
of
the
state.
the
--
that
--
that's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
and
that's
indicate
--
that
that's
--
that
the
state
is
going
to
bear
the
cost
of
--
of
the
--
the
publicity
campaign
for
the
--
the
promotion
or
defeat
of
the
particular
legislation
and
--
and
the
federal
government
should
not
be
required
to
bear
that
another
additional
portion
through
the
use
of
the
deduction
for
ordinary
and
business
expense.
before
my
time
is
up,
i
just
like
to
say
in
this
case
that
perhaps
this
court
has
never
passed
upon
the
issue
of
whether
this
business
deduction
is
--
is
allowable
with
respect
to
an
initiative
of
referendum
but
three
federal
circuit
courts
repeal
have
done.
the
two
involved
in
this
case
and
the
next
case,
that
is
the
eighth
and
the
ninth
circuit,
not
only
in
these
two
cases
but
in
earlier
cases
going
back
1934
and
the
ninth
circuit
at
least
went
back
to
two
cases
in
1934
and
1936
and
the
first
circuit
in
a
recent
case
involving
a
greyhound
referendum
in
--
in
suffolk
county
in
--
in
massachusetts,
the
revere
racing
company
case
in
which
there
is
a
referendum
as
to
whether
greyhound
racing
should
be
continued
in
the
--
in
that
particular
county
and
publicity
campaign
was
indulged
in
as
here
and
the
expenses
of
that
campaign
were
not
allowed
to
be
deducted
under
this
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
they
were
all
23
(a)
(1)
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
have
not
tried
to
mr.
justice.
if
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
i
will
in
--
in
the
second
case
and
i
will
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
will
--
i
will
certainly
deal
with
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
has
not
previously
furnished
to
us
the
material
on
the
colorado
united
contribution
which
he
discussed
with
accorded
--
appears
clearly
from
the
excerpt
that
he
read
in
the
research
institute
of
america.
and
my
colleague
informs
me
that
the
amendment
in
the
--
that
the
provision
in
that
case
was
a
constitutional
amendment
and
the
commissioner
was
then
following
the
decision
in
luther
ely
smith
at
which
he
--
in
which
he
had
acquiesced,
so
that
the
decision
that
the
grant
of
an
allowance
of
the
contribution
in
that
case
went
under
this
old
decision
in
which
the
commissioner
had
then
acquiesced
which
he
does
not
know
acquiesced
and
which
we
believe
to
be
totally
wrong.
i
have
reserved
to
this
case
the
discussion
of
the
heininger
case
because
we
conceive
that
in
this
case,
the
adoption
of
prohibition
in
the
state
of
arkansas
would
have
put
the
petitioner
out
of
business.
i
should,
perhaps,
have
said
in
the
earlier
case
that
we
do
not
concede
that
the
adoption
of
the
washington
initiative
would've
put
the
tax
person
in
that
case
out
of
business.
we
will
not
press
the
point
that
they
would've
been
financially
effective.
we
do
not
concede
that
they
would've
been
put
out
of
business.
in
this
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir,
the
--
the
--
only
the
finding
was
that
90%
of
the
wholesalers
would've
been
put
out
of
business.
but
there's
no
showing
which
particular
wholesalers
would've
remained
in
existence.
and
it
could
very
well
been
that
those
particular
wholesalers
would've
been
able
to
remain
in
--
in
existence.
and
the
district
court
as
colonel
wiener
pointed
out
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
even
no
showing
that
they
would
be
affected
by
the
--
by
the
injuriously
affected
by
the
initiative.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
question.
and
--
so
i
would
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
here,
it's
clear
that
they've
been
put
out.i
would
say,
and
i
said,
that
the
(inaudible)
in
the
other
case.
there
were
--
90%
of
the
wholesalers
had
been
put
out
of
business.
and
it
would
depend
upon
the
financial
status
and
other
factors
whether
a
particular
wholesale
would've
been
able
to
--
the
wholesalers
aren't
fungible
and
--
that's
what
[laughs]
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
the
distinction
turns
on
that
at
all.
but
i
just
say
that
in
case
it
is
thought
that
the
distinction
should
turn
on
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
think
so.
but
it
is
possible
that
others
might.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
now,
to
the
discussion
of
the
heininger
case
that
debt
is
to
engage
in
false
and
fraudulent
advertising
through
the
mails.
the
first
thing
to
point
out,
i
think,
is
that
that
case
involve
litigation
expenses
and
not
lobbying.
litigation
expenses
have
had
a
long
and
different
history
under
the
internal
revenue
code
from
lobbying
expenses
and
expenses
for
the
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation.
there
is
no
comparable
tax
equilibrium
policy,
we
believe.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
indebted
to
professor
stanley
surrey
of
harvard
law
school
for
the
phrase.
the
--
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
believe
after
he
got
there.[laughs]
the
--
the
concept
--[laughter]
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
mr.
justice,
the
concept,
as
you
know,
goes
back
to
--
to
judge
learned
hand
or
even
earlier.
but
stanley
surrey
is
the
author
of
the
particular
phrase.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
shorthand
(inaudible)
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
tax
equilibrium,
tax
equilibrium.
to
--
to
make
sure
that
people
supporting
an
opposing
particular
aspects
of
legislation
do
not
get
a
benefit
from
the
federal
--
from
the
federal
treasury,
that
is
if
i
can
repeat
what
i've
said
before
and
elaborate
on
a
little
bit,
the
tax
person
in
this
and
in
the
preceding
case
would
be
able
to
get
a
very
sizable
deduction
of
--
not
in
their
particular
case,
to
call
the
brewers
of
--
or
liquor
interest
of
arkansas.
it
spent
about
a
$100,000
to
defeat
prohibition
in
arkansas,
and
the
other
case
about
over
$200,000
was
spent.
they
would
--
the
various
interests
involved
would
be
able
to
deduct
under
the
theory
of
the
petitioners
in
these
cases,
the
--
the
cost
of
this
advertising
completely.
their
opponent
who
were
not
engaged
in
business
would
not
be
able
to
deduct
it
at
all.
they
would
have
to
pay
out
of
their
own
pocket
the
full
amount
of
any
countervailing
advertising
and
publicity.
also
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no,
no
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
--
as
far
as
i
know
--
at
least
that
they
were
--
it
was
within
--
they
were
within
the
--
the
limits
of
--
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think,
in
this
respect
--
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
respect
to
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
to
the
financial
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think,
yes.
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
it's
terribly
important
in
--
in
political
life.
how
much
money
you
have
to
spend
and
if
the
amount
of
money
you
have
to
spend
is
going
to
be
half
or
maybe
more
than
that
because
the
--
your
federal
income
tax
is
--
is
going
to
take
it
up,
then
you're
better
able
to
spend
a
lot
of
money.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
but
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
--
if
i
may
use
your
suggestion,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
what
this
regulation
has
done
and
what
congress
in
--
in
reenacting
an
acquiescing
in
this
regulation.
and
the
word
“acquiescing”
in
the
regulation
is
this
court's
word
two
or
three
times
in
decisions
in
other
fields
not
my
word
alone.
what
congress
has
done
really
is
to
say
that
in
the
field
of
elections
and
on
the
field
of
legislation,
you
have
to
act
as
a
citizen.
you
cannot
act
as
a
businessman.
you
have
to
act
as
a
citizen,
whether
you
support
or
oppose,
you
have
to
act
as
a
citizen.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
the
--
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
we
were
faced
here
with
just
the
words
of
the
statute
and
this
problem
arose
the
first
time
in
1958,
i
do
not
deny
that
i
would
have
a
very
hard
case.
but
i
am
not
faced
with
that
situation.
i
am
faced
with
a
statute
and
a
regulation,
a
regulation
which
is
almost
contemporaneous
with
the
first
income
tax
act,
a
regulation
which
has
been
interpreted
through
the
years,
particularly
since
this
court
decided
the
textile
mills
case
in
1941
as
disallowing
this
kind
of
deduction.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
bare
the
burden
of
what
one
would
have
to
decide
they
know
but
with
all
the
--
without
the
benefit
of
this
past
history.
i
have
--
i
think
i
can
properly
rely
on
the
fact
that
this
regulation
which
--
which
adopt
and
incorporate
the
notion
of
tax
equilibrium
has
been
on
the
book
since
1918
and
was
foreshadowed
even
in
1915.
and
i
think
i
can
rely
greatly
on
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
rely
on
--
on
slee.
i
just
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
mentioned
slee
as
a
case
which
really
first
articulated
this
notion
which
we
think
was
incorporated
in
--
in
the
regulation
previously
and
which
has
been
carry
on
through.
the
cases
that
i
rely
on
the
lower
court
are
cases
all
under
23
(a)
(1),
all
the
cases
that
i
rely
on
in
this
court,
the
case
particularly.
the
textile
mills
case
is
a
--
is
a
similar
case.
i
rely
on
no
case
really
under
the
charitable
contribution.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
a
deduction
for
a
publicity
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
yes,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
a
deduction
for
a
publicity
campaign.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
that
if
--
if
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
publicity
having
to
do
--
it's
--
again
i
say,
it's
not
a
question
of
disallowing
or
prohibiting
the
publicity.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there's
a
question
of
how
much
the
--
the
regulation
says
advertising
other
than
trade
advertising
is
not
allowable.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
well,
on
the
house
of
lords,
if
i
may
go
off
in
a
minute,
the
statute
is
different.
it
does
not
contain
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
as
colonel
wiener
mentioned,
i'd
like
to
say
the
statute
is
different.
it
was
accredit
to
a
decision
of
the
house
of
lords.
there
was
no
such
history
as
we
have
here
and
no
regulation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
true.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
cannot
with
a
wiser
result.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
still
disagreed.[laughter]
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
return
to
the
heininger
case
because
i
do
think
that
it
has
a
bearing
here,
and
i
don't
mean
to
avoid
this
cut.
the
first
thing,
as
i
said
before,
it
involve
litigation
expenses
which
has
a
different
history.
the
second
thing
is,
that
there
was
no
regulation
involve
there.
and
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
opinion,
mr.
justice
black
for
the
court
said,
“we
do
not
have
here
the
aid
of
an
interpretive
regulation
of
the
commissioner
as
we
had
in
the
textile
mills
case.”
so
that
there,
the
court
was
being
asked
to
decide
a
question
without
the
aid
of
the
--
of
the
regulation
and
the
history
which
we
have
here.
and
the
third
thing
about
that
case
was
that
the
aspect
of
destruction
of
business,
i
think,
was
not
central
to
the
case.
i
think
that
if
dr.
heininger's
business
had
not
been
destroyed,
but
just
been
seriously
affected,
but
it
--
they
didn't
stop
all
this
math
only
part
of
this
mess,
the
decision
of
the
court
would've
been
the
same.
and
certainly,
since
--
decision
of
the
court
went
on
the
ground
that
the
--
that
the
postal
fraud
statutes
did
not
require
the
disallowance
of
his
litigation
expenses.
and
that
would've
been
true
whether
his
--
his
business
was
destroyed
or
whether
his
business
was
only
seriously
affected.
so
that
on
the
whole
i
think
that
the
heininger
case
does
not
control
this
case.
i
don't
deny
it
has
a
bearing
on
the
case
--
on
the
case,
but
i
think
it
doesn't
control
the
case.
the
--
back
for
a
moment
to
the
issue
of
the
matter
of
tax
equilibrium
if
i
may
be
pardoned
to
use
that
shorthand
expression.
i
would
like
to
--
to
point
out
one
further
thing
that
i
think
failed
to
make
clear
to
the
court,
and
that
is
that
in
this
day
and
age
when
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
initiatives
and
referenda
throughout
the
country
on
all
matters
of
importance
involving
matters
of
taxation,
matters
of
regulation,
matters
in
which
the
public
is
--
is
largely
concerned
and
then
--
which
industries
are
concerned.
what
you
will
have
if
businesses
can
deduct
their
publicity
campaigns
is
a
great
advantage
to
the
larger
businesses
which
have
--
which
have
better
--
which
have
higher
rates
of
taxation
and
therefore
get
a
greater
benefit
from
their
expenditures,
that
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice
whitaker.
the
government
would
pay
52%
of
the
cost
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
true.
but
the
--
but
the
person
on
the
other
side
there
is
the
government.
on
the
other
side
here,
there
are
other
businesses
maybe
or
private
citizens
who
also
have
an
interest
as
private
--
as
citizens
in
the
adoption
or
defeat
of
the
proposed
legislation.
and
it's
not
only
--
if
the
corporation,
if
that's
true,
with
individual
taxpayers,
it
may
be
even
70%
to
80%
of
the
government
would
bear
in
--
in
--
and
we
think
this
is
an
important
factor
that
this
is
not
an
issue
which
relates
only
to
this
particular
tax.
but
it
also
relates
to
things
as
the
--
as
the
court
knows
are
going
out
throughout
the
country
today
that
is
more
and
more,
these
issues
are
coming
before
the
public
in
initiative
and
in
referenda.
and
they're
very
important
issues
relating
to
taxation
and
--
and
business
regulation.
and
great
sums
of
money
are
--
are
being
expended
and
having
expended
in
the
past
for
promotion
or
defeat
of
this
various
projects.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
say
there's
anything
wrong
about
this.
there
isn't
anything
wrong
except
into
far
as
--
as
it
may
violate
a
particular
statute
or
regulation
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
in
the
liquor
industry,
maybe
all
really.
and
that's
another
fact
that
i'd
like
to
say.
these
people
are
in
the
liquor
industry.
the
liquor
industry
has
historically
been
subject
to
--
to
regulation
and
prohibition
more
than
any
other
industry.
they
ought
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
should
--
to
put
it
perhaps
rather
bluntly
and
crudely.
it's
the
one
industry
that
has
to
expect
this
kind
of
thing
in
--
in
the
future.
so
that
i
don't
think
that
if
i
--
if
any
industry
has
to
be
singled
out
for
bailing
out
with
respect
to
this,
that
it's
the
liquor
industry
that
should
be
singled
out
because
both
prior
to
--
to
prohibition
--
during
prohibition
and
certainly
under
the
21st
amendment,
the
--
the
liquor
industry
knows
that
it's
going
to
have
face
and
it
does
face
regularly
these
various
attempts
to
--
to
change
and
--
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
--
you
mean
that
they
ought
--
that
--
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
don't
deny
that
perhaps
it
does
make
it
more
of
an
ordinary
expense.
but
i
--
i
think
that
perhaps
it
indicates
the
--
the
kind
of
capital
expense
which
can't
be
considered
an
ordinary
expense
that
--
it's
something
that
they
have
to
take
into
account
and
appreciate
over
the
years
rather
--
