mr.
e.
chas.
eichenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
certiorari
to
the
eight
circuit
tried
in
the
tax
court,
there
ruled
against
the
petitioner
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
lobbying.
there
was
a
practically
similar
fact
situation
as
in
the
case
described
by
colonel
wiener
and
initiative
in
referendum
measured
opposed
by
the
clients
f.
strauss,
incorporated,
a
liquor
wholesaler.
mr.
e.
chas.
eichenbaum
it
was
an
initiated
act.
and
the
initiated
act
would
have
brought
back
prohibition
to
the
state
of
arkansas.
and
i
may
say
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
90%
question
of
whether
or
not
the
business
of
the
taxpayer
would've
been
destroyed.
there
is
no
question
as
to
percentage.
the
record
clearly
indicates,
and
it
has
never
been
contravened,
our
taxpayer
would've
been
out
of
business.
i
should
like
to
say
that
our
record
differs
but
it's
likely
with
reference
to
the
state
of
facts
other
than
with
that
situation.
there
are,
in
this
record,
a
typical
advertisement
such
as
have
been
heretofore
discussed.
i
should
also
like
to
say,
and
i
think
that
it
is
the
crux
of
this
situation
that
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expense
undergone
by
this
taxpayer
apart
from
the
regulation
would
be
completely
allowed.
i
repeat,
apart
from
the
regulation,
the
expenditures
would
have
been
ordinary
and
necessary
expense.
now,
why
ordinary
and
necessary?
we
may
deal
slightly
with
the
elementals
for
a
moment,
but
i
think
it
gets
back
to
something
that
was
in
the
question
by
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice
a
few
moments
ago.
what
is
ordinary
in
the
sense
of
the
statute
and
the
deductions
which
are
permitted
under
the
statute?
ordinary
or
the
expenses
in
the
sense
that
they
are
usual
and
customary
in
the
business
community
and
so
to
the
challenge
and
so
to
defend
is
ordinary.
i
--
if
i
may
say
so
that
which
embarks
upon
a
new
course,
a
new
venture,
again
becomes
an
ad
hoc
situation,
again
becomes
a
matter
for
determination
of
whether
it
is
ordinary
and
necessary.
but
there
can
be
no
dispute
that
to
defend
the
preservation
of
the
taxpayer,
i
need
not
cite
the
well-known
phrases
in
heininger
from
the
circuit
court
which
is
--
i
have
cited
approvingly
by
this
court
in
the
levy
case
that
if
you
have
no
business,
you
have
no
income,
if
you
have
no
income,
you
have
no
tax.
in
this
case,
ordinary
is
in
the
sense
of
the
usual
and
customary
and
it
becomes
ordinary
to
defend
against
the
challenge.
and
necessary
is
necessary,
necessary
in
the
usual
sense
and
in
the
tax
import.
necessary,
because
it
becomes
appropriate
and
helpful
and
in
this
sense,
necessary
for
survival.
so,
apart
from
the
regulation
with
which
we
shall
deal
in
this
case
expense
allowable
ordinary
and
necessary.
now,
we
take
the
position
and
we
differ
slightly
probably
only
in
the
order
of
presentation
with
our
brother
colonel
wiener,
we
take
the
position
that
the
regulation
does
not
apply.
we
take
the
--
the
position
that
it
is
not
intended
by
its
terms
so
to
apply.
now,
the
reason
that
we
take
that
position
is
that
we
say
that
legislation,
in
its
ordinary
sense,
does
not
include
the
initiative
and
referendum
procedures
or
the
constitutional
procedures
of
amendment.
and
we
advance
that
reason
for
--
on
two
bases.
the
first
is
that
we
think
that
it
may
well
have
been
out
of
contemplation
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute
or
out
of
contemplation
by
the
commissioner
in
the
promulgation
of
the
regulation
that
those
appeals
directly
to
the
people
should
have
supervision
or
governing
restrictions.
now,
we
do
say
that
with
reference
to
such
basis
that
luther
ely
smith
is,
of
course,
highly
significant
and
the
acquiescence
of
the
commissioner
for
the
period
of
14
years
which
we
shall
touch
upon
in
the
matter
of
the
question
of
reenactment
again
even
more
highly
significant.
what
we
say
beyond
that
that
the
purpose
of
the
regulation,
if
not,
if
--
if
applicable
to
matters
of
all
technical
character
in
legislation
and
one
can
characterize
technically
initiative
in
referendum
procedures
and
constitutional
amendment
as
a
type
of
legislation,
we
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
safeguards
are
to
reach
the
influencing
of
legislative
procedures
so
as
to
safeguard
against
improper
acts,
that
is
to
say
that
the
regulation,
the
regulation
itself
is
not
applicable
because
it
is
intended
to
pertain
to
illegal
activities.
and
why
may
we
say
that?
we
say
that
because
of
all
reasons
textile
mills
decision
itself
indicates
the
applicability.
those
were
not
idle
words
that
were
written
when
defining
the
--
the
prerogatives
of
determination
by
the
commissioner.
this
court
said
that
ordinary
and
necessary
may
be
construed
and
interpreted
to
mean
--
to
--
to
convey
certain
meanings,
and
what
meanings?
meanings
of
ordinary
and
necessary
as
distinguished
from
the
illegal
and
not
necessarily
always
the
definitive
certainties
of
illegality.
in
textile
mills,
there
may
have
been
no
certainty
upon
which
--
that
some
could
be
placed.
but
as
the
court
said,
it
belongs
to
that
class
of
contracts,
that
class
of
contracts
which
might
be
and
which
you
use
the
word
“tainting”.
ordinary
and
necessary
have
their
specific
meanings
in
the
interpretation
of
tax
law
in
the
opinion
in
the
hubert
case.
necessary
had
a
certain
meaning.
it
was
not
necessary
to
violate
the
law.
it
is
always
within
the
prerogatives
of
the
commissioner
to
interpret,
interpret
but
not
extend.
interpret
but
not
subtract
from
the
substantiality
of
the
provisions.
why
do
we
argue
initially
that
the
regulation
is
invalid?
we
do
it
for
a
reason.
because
we
say
that
by
giving
this
interpretation,
we
have
avoided
the
question
as
under
the
rules
of
interpretation,
we
think
we
should
proceed
to
avoid
the
questions
of
constitutionality.
because
certainly,
if
applied,
i
will
say
in
--
invalidity
and
unconstitutionality,
because
if
applied
to
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
to
the
same
degree,
as
may
have
been
argued
in
the
preceding
case,
to
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses,
it
is
an
obvious
over
extension
of
the
statute.
applied
so,
applied
so
the
regulation,
applied
to
the
facts
in
these
cases,
constitutes
a
reaching
out
into
the
area
of
legitimate
business
expense
and
ringing
from
the
business
itself
the
right
to
defend.
now,
why
constitutional?
and
we
think
this
is
a
necessary
position
which
we
must
take.
we
think
that
it
is
apparent,
that
not
only
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
stated
in
the
companion
case,
not
only
our
deductions
matter
of
--
matters
of
grace,
but
deductions
when
extended
cannot
be
invaded
for
the
purpose
of
distinction.
and
there,
if
we
may
say
so
again,
we
urge
that
speiser
versus
randall,
first
unitarian
church
obviously
extend
to
a
situation.
it
is
more
than
a
deduction
immunities
granted
under
the
law
cannot
be
invaded
justly.
deductions
cannot
be
invaded
justly.
now,
let's
talk
about
establishing
a
tax
equilibrium,
that
sounds
very
good
except
that
there's
no
tax
equilibrium
between
one
who
has
income
and
one
who
has
an
income.
there
is
no
tax
equilibrium
between
the
individual
and
the
corporation,
between
the
individual
who
is
in
business
and
not
making
income,
not
earning
income
and
one
who
has.
a
tax
equilibrium
has
no
place
here.
nor
do
i
think
that
tax
equilibrium
has
any
point
in
the
history
of
this.
i
should
like
to
touch
upon
that
history.
i
think
it
varies
upon
the
question
of
reenactment.
now,
there
has
been
mentioned
here
and
i
touched
upon
the
arguments
which
preceded
of
that
during
this
period
in
which
the
regulation
was
on
the
books
that
there
was
only
one
case,
the
luther
ely
smith
case,
the
tax
court
case.
i
beg
to
differ.
now,
let's
see
what
cases
there
were
during
the
period
prior
to
1939
as
being
recognized
by
counsel
in
statement
that
post
1939,
no
enactment
to
the
tax
year.
well,
now,
we
recall
lucas
versus
wofford,
fifth
circuit.
what
was
lucas
versus
wofford?
well-known
to
this
court,
appearance
before
legislative
committee,
deduction
allowed,
ground
legal
methods
of
presentation
in
matters
of
legislation.
los
angeles
and
utah
rail
--
los
angeles
and
salt
lake
city
railroad
company
and
all
the
companion
railroad
company
cases
which,
as
the
court
will
recall,
were
the
cases
in
which
railroads
subsequent
to
world
war
i
and
the
time
in
which
the
government
took
over
the
operation
of
railroads
were
about
to
return
them.
and
all
the
railroad
companies
filed,
issued
it
--
advertisements
with
reference
to
the
type
of
legislation
and
the
type
of
conditions
because
it
would
be
done
by
legislation
that
the
railroad
should
be
returned
in.
now,
during
these
years
--
during
the
years
pre
1939,
there
was
no
single
instance.
no,
i
--
i
am
in
error.
there
was.
there
was
one
case,
and
it
was
not
in
accord
with
the
majority,
the
sunset
scavenger
case,
if
i
may
refer
to
it.
but
all
other
cases
during
that
period,
completely
distinguished
the
legal
from
that
which
was
within
the
tainted
class
from
that
which
the
commissioner
should
properly
define
and
determine
and
interpret.
and
so,
up
to
1939,
what
was
the
situation?
could
there
be
acquiescence
by
--
and
the
eighth
court
suggested
that
there
might
be
reenactment
by
acquiescence
with
reference
to
cases
which
favor
the
petitioners?
and
i
should
add
that
textile
mills
in
setting
forth
that
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
was
to
permit
the
commissioner
to
define
that
class,
that
deduction
which
should
be
disallowed
only
again
serves
to
point
up
the
reenactment.
reenactment
is
the
acceptance
of
long,
well-continued,
well-settled
rules.
now,
did
that
exist
here?
counsel
would
indicate
it
existed.
but
i
have
this
to
say
about
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
certainly,
one
would
think,
certainly
one
would
think
that
the
person
most
likely
to
know
that
rule
if
it
existed
would
be
the
respondent,
would
be
the
government.
but
up
until
1950,
the
year
our
tax
year
involve
the
respondent
himself,
the
united
states
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
was
himself
interpreting,
was
himself
interpreting
the
regulation
not
as
counsel
has
argued.
there

i
--
i
must
suggest
that
the

is
not

if
i
were
able
to
learn
something
--
bring
something

i

they
told

didn't

may
i
read
it?
