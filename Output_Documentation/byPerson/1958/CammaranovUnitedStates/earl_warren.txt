colonel
wiener,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
before
you
--
you
proceed
farther,
may
i
ask
if
the
regulation
implies
that
it
would
be
illegal
for
your
clients
to
spend
money
on
this
cause
or
does
it
just
say
that
the
--
the
expenditures
are
not
deductible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
--
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this
and
that
do
you
make
any
--
any
differentiation
between
affecting
a
man's
business
and
affect
--
affecting
his
personal
rights
let
us
say.
or
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
any
expenditure
by
anybody
in
a
--
in
an
initiative
election
should
be
deducted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i'd
like
to
know
the
distinction
between
the
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
colonel,
do
you
--
you
make
--
you
stress
the
fact
that
this
would
put
your
clients
out
of
business.
would
your
argument
be
different
if
it
only
affected
them
in
a
slight
degree?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
who
would
decide
--
now,
if
it's
a
different
question
of
fact,
who
would
decide
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
how
seriously
a
man's
business
rights
would
be
affected
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
purpose
of
deduction
of
taxes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
colonel
wiener.
chief
justice
earl
warren
colonel,
could
i
ask
you
this?
if
we
should
decide
that
these
expenditures
are
deductible,
would
it
not
follow
that
expenses
of
a
--
an
organization
like
your
own
putting
an
initiative
measure
on
the
ballot
for
the
benefit
of
its
own
business
should
be
deductible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
follow.
i
--
i
don't
see
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
difference
it
would
make
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
side
of
the
fence
you're
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
so
many
--
there's
so
many
businesses
that
--
that
contend
that
if
there's
any
regulation
of
their
business
at
all,
it
will
destroy
their
business
and
many
of
them
contend
that
there
are
shackles
on
them
at
the
present
time.
and
if
your
people
decided
to
initiate
a
measure
and
pay
the
expenses
of
it
to
take
off
the
shackles
of
the
businesses
they
claim,
why
wouldn't
that
be
just
as
deductible
as
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
i
take
it
as
entirely
different.

mr.
eichenbaum,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
initiative
or
referendum
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
use
whatever
time
you
wish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
still
disagreed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
