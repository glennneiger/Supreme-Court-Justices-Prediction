now
isn't
it
true
though,
mr.
davis
that
part
of
the
vine
and
part
of
the
tree
has
been
the
tax
court
decision
in
the
--
what's
his
name,
leonard
smith,
the
missouri
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
so
for
14
years
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
any
event,
that
--
that
decision
has
been
on
the
books
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
14
years
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
any
reenactments
--
reenactments
by
congress
during
that
period
would
be
subject
to
whatever
worth
in
this
case,
the
reenactment
doctrine
at
hand.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
tax
court,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
one
was
the
moseley
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
when?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
davis,
i've
never
read
the
mcclintock-trunkey
case
but
it's
indicated
in
your
brief
that
the
--
the
tax
court
decision
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
on
another
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
davis,
were
all
these
cases
23
(a)
(1)
(a)
cases
or
were
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
23
(o)
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
because
you've
addressed
a
good
deal
of
your
argument
to
the
--
to
this
proposition
as
though
it
were
a
23
(o)
case.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
you
have
tried
to
but
you
haven't
for
example
as
--
so
far
as
i
know
even
mentioned
the
heininger
case.
justice
potter
stewart
very
well.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
eichenbaum,
did
--
does
it
appear
in
there
what
colorado
united
incorporated
is?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
davis,
as
you
pointed
out
this
phrase
“tax
equilibrium”
which
has
a
very
nice
ring
to
it,
originated
perhaps
as
such
with
professor
surrey.
but
it
was
--
it
dates
back
to
cases
like
slee
against
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
commissioner
in
the
second
circuit.
but
isn't
it
true
that
those
were
23
old
cases
that
they
were
contributions
made.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
therefore,
isn't
it
also
true
that
--
that
in
addition
to
--
philosophically,
also
looking
back
to
the
terms
of
the
statute.
there's
a
very,
very
deal
in
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said
that
the
reason
that
the
proponents
of
prohibition
couldn't
deduct
this,
and
that
the
reason
that
these
petitioners,
perhaps,
could
deduct
this
was
that
in
the
one
case,
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
their
business,
then
in
the
other
case,
it
meant
the
destruction
of
their
business.
in
one
case,
it
was
a
business
--
not
a
business
expense.
in
the
other
case,
it
clearly
was.
now,
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
only
--
my
only
query
with
was
how
much
can
you
rely
on
cases
such
as
slee
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
business
expense
to
the
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
very
few,
wouldn't
you
say,
and
neither
one
of
us
knows,
but
wouldn't
you
guess
there
are
very
few
of
these
referenda
that
have
the
effect
of
absolutely
destroying
somebody's
business?
