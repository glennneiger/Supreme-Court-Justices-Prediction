could
--
could
the
state
itself
not
have
participated
going
into
the
venture
of
business
but
if
not
have
bought
from
these
wholesalers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
instead,
they
could
have
bought
only
from
one
and
that's
what,
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
would've
been
only
one
retailer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
consumptive
capacity
of
the
citizens
of
washington
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
(inaudible)
judge
said
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
these
--
one
of
the
advertisements
constitutionally
protected
is
a
form
of
free
speech?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
it
be
a
point
--
could
--
could
an
individual
citizen
putting
to
one
side
the
corporations,
could
a
citizen
be
prohibited
from
getting
a
full
page
ad
as
to
endorse
(inaudible)
why
a
private
enterprise
is
better
than
public
entitlements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
talked
a
little
out
of
this
--
this
interest
with
the
devotion
into
biology,
put
in
a
front
--
full-page
ad
in
the
new
york
times
saying
that
he
wants
to
reserve
this
foolish
notions
that
smoking
is
deleterious,
prevention
as
to
instability.
that
would
not
be
propaganda,
but
if
he
doesn't
as
an
expert
with
a
tobacco
interest,
it
would
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
disinterestedness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
suggesting
the
little
hypothesis
to
show
on
satisfaction,
the
notion
of
what
is
and
what
isn't
propaganda.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
think
it
might
implicate
the
federal
government
in
being
for
or
against
prohibition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
trying
to
--
every
question
that
arises
here
was
whether
the
government
could
get
the
money
or
not
get
the
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
same
reason
that
u.s.
steel
and
all
the
big
industries
had
not
support
universities
and
colleges
as
being
good
for
business,
i
suppose
he
deduct
those
things
in
business
expenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
people
advertise
their
money,
can't
deduct
the
small
--
except
to
the
limit
of
charitable
deductions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
brand
new
question
as
you
indicate
mainly
whether
the
considerations
of
policy
begins
to
align
contributions
but
they
aren't
being
pressured
to
bear
upon
congress
all
or
some
are
difficult
that
are
involved
in
that.
all
the
abuses
that
we
know
may
fairly
be
transferred
to
those
dates
which
allowed
the
initiatives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
but
the
facts
maybe
so
different
that
the
background
that
we
see
swaying
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
we
denied
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
not
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
a
protest
--
how
you
can
promote
legislation
by
conventional
legislature
without
getting
into
the
territory
of
lobbying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
--
do
you
think
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
already
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
(inaudible)
when
you
come
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
write
letters
to
congressmen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wrote
law
review
articles
then
they
got
to
congressmen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
also
putting
to
one
side
any
suggestion
of
any
kind
of
blackening
aspects
to
this
kind
of
activity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
don't
you
--
why
don't
you
say
they
have
no
standing
to
understand
this.
maybe
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
guess
i
don't
apprehend
what
you've
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
did
more
to
me
than
they're
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
concealed
that
there
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
a
lot
of
adversary
would
have
to
be
condemned
as
reprehensible,
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
stated
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
stated
the
way
lobbying
is
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
rejecting
your
legal
conclusion.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
it
carried
within
the
sea
of
mystery
that
lobbying
--
and
that's
the
other
thing
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
do
they
find
idealist
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
understanding
that
that
domain
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
guess
that
these
people
didn't
want
to
be
put
out
of
business
or
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
--
they
certainly
could
guess
they
didn't
want
the
state
of
washington
to
go
into
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
you
had
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
happens
with
deductibility
of
those
two
before
doing
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
great
difficulty
with
general
proposition
being
out
that
--
that
if
legislation
comes
to
the
people,
that
the
people
most
affected
by
the
action
to
be
taken
shouldn't
be
able
to
address
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
could
we
--
and
is
that
just
--
just
as
much
of
a
business
expense
as
--
as
paying
for
the
raw
materials
that
goes
into
manufacturing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
myself
i
should
be
clear,
it
could
not
be
prohibited
constitutionally,
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
has
that
measure
of
legal
protection
then
i
find
it
very
hard
to
deny
the
quality
of
a
business
expense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
it's
the
usual
experience
in
life,
advertently
it's
own
reward,
that
you
don't
get
paid
for
with
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
a
--
we're
a
private
enterprise
society.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
it
--
it
may
have
adopted
the
other
view
in
saying,
“people
who
are
in
it
mainly
for

have

people
who
are
in
business
should
be
allowed
to
conduct
their
business
enterprise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
supposing,
what
is
the
case
where
this
court
had
to
decide
or
to
initiate
that
the
referendum
was
legislated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
it
can.
there's
one
(inaudible)
justice
felix

certainly
at
times.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
decided
by
a
state
in
--
of
this
(inaudible)
it
is
at
most
initiative
states.
the
state
itself
puts
out
supporting
arguments
for
the
adoption.
justice

do
you
think
we
could
reverse
this
case
and
not
mr.
wiener's
case?
justice

wonderful
phrase.
i

i
mean
to
be

after
get
up
there
or
before

got
there.
justice

put
it
in
words
that
fix
the
idea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
do
you
think
bishop
cannon
would
like
to
be
put

on

be

justice

--
justice

you
brushed
off
my
suggestion
that
virtue
is
not
intangible.
justice
felix

mr.
davis,
may
i
just
give
you
the
suggestion
that
that
the
crux
of
the
question,
milking
the
coconut,
which
you
so
subtly
administered
the
word,
when
you
used
the
word
--
phrase,
“this
kind
of
deduction,”
the
whole
question
is
whether
it's
--
whether
it
is
this
kind
of
deduction.
justice
felix

that's
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
just
publicity
because
certainly
publicity
having

having
to
do
with

justice

--
any
of
the

that
process
are
allowed.
justice

well,
i
mean
allow
--
justice

--
deductibles.
justice
felix

well,
i
do
commend
the
house
of
lords
on
that

what
they
do
and
mostly
--
justice

i
mean
--
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it
governs
this
case.
justice

i
wanted

i
want

justice

i
want
to

to
make
one
commendatory
remark,
mandatory

it
