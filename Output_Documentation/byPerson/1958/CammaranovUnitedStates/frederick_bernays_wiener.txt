mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
expenditures
made
by
taxpayers
to
save
an
existing
business
from
destruction
ceased
to
be
deductible
as
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
because
incurred
in
an
effort
to
convey
arguments
to
the
taxpayers'
fellow
citizens
to
persuade
them
to
vote
against
an
initiative
measure
which
would've
destroyed
their
business.
the
facts
are
very
simple.
petitioners
husband
and
wife
on
a
partnership
interest
in
the
firm
of
beer
wholesalers
in
the
state
of
washington.
in
1948,
there
was
submitted
to
the
voters
of
that
state
under
the
initiative
provisions
of
its
constitution,
an
initiative
measure
which
proposed
to
close
all
retail
beer
outlets
and
to
place
all
retail
sales
of
beer
in
state
hands
just
as
hard
liquor
had
been
under
state
control
since
repealed.
now,
this
measure
closing
all
retail
stores
permitting
retail
sales
of
beer
only
by
the
state
would've
reduced
the
number
of
retail
establishments
in
the
state
to
one,
to
wit,
the
state
of
washington
and
would've
put
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
beer
supposed
sellers
out
of
business.
so
in
order
to
defend
themselves
against
this
imminently
threatened
destruction
of
their
livelihood,
petitioners'
expended
money
together
with
other
similarly
situated
to
persuade
their
fellow
citizens
to
vote
against
this
initiative.
these
arguments
were
presented
in
the
form
of
radio
broadcasts,
newspaper
advertising,
streetcar
cards
and
the
like.
they
were
successful.
the
initiative
was
defeated.
they
stayed
in
business
and
on
their
tax
return
for
that
year,
they
took
as
a
deduction
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
the
amount
of
money
attributable
to
their
interest
in
the
partnership
that
had
been
expended
for
these
purposes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
were
wholesalers.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
closed
the
retail
stores
and
made
the
state
of
washington
the
only
retail
salesman
in
the
state.
the
deduction
was
disallowed
and
this
action
was
brought
to
recover
the
payment
under
--
made
under
protest,
judgment
went
for
the
united
states
in
the
district
court.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
it's
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
it
could
have
bought
from
one
but
the
testimony
in
the
record
was
that
with
only
one
retailer
in
the
state,
90%
of
the
existing
wholesalers
would
have
been
out
of
business.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
because
only
the
state
of
washington
was
the
--
the
state
of
washington
would
be
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
would
not
--
would
not
have
been
impaired
but
--
but
the
one
retailer
would
--
would
have
kept
in
business
only
about
10%
of
the
wholesalers.
in
other
words,
these
people
faced
a
90%
chance
of
the
extinction
of
their
business.
now,
in
the
district
court,
the
--
the
judge
said,
“it
isn't
clear
to
me
how
the
destruct
--
the
closing
of
retail
stores
affects
wholesale
business.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
ceased
on
this
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
where
we
showed
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
i'm
afraid
we
labored
the
point
pretty
hard
that
of
course
if
you
close
the
retail
stores,
the
wholesalers
are
out
of
business
and
the
government
doesn't
make
any
attempt
here
to
support
that
alternative
holding.
so,
we're
all
in
accord
that
there
was
at
least
a
90%
chance
over
this
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
am
not
familiar
with
judge
boggs'
views
on
the
subject
of
--
even
light
wines
or
beer.
i
don't
know.
he
may
have
been
confused
by
the
fact
that
there
were
two
different
words
and
he
didn't
think
about
it.
at
any
rate,
there
is
no
attempt
made
here
by
the
government
to
support
the
alternative
holding.
so
that
we're
all
here
in
agreement
on
the
fact
that
this
had
a
90%
chance
of
destroying
these
taxpayers'
business
and
we
think
that
is
the
most
important
single
fact
in
the
entire
case,
that
what
they
were
fighting
would
have
put
them
out
of
business.
and
reflexly,
reflexly,
the
government
agrees
with
us
because
in
the
entire
50
pages
of
their
brief,
there
is
no
reference
to
the
business
effect
of
this
initiative
on
petitioner's
business.
read
--
reading
the
government's
brief,
you
would
suppose
that
petitioner's
were
wholesale
florists
who
like
to
go
to
the
tavern
and
drink
beer
with
the
nature
lovers
and
talk
about
motion,
all
the
stuff
--
a
nasty
backbreaking
stuff
you
can
have
in
a
garden.
but
this
had
a
business
effect
and
that's
what
the
government
doesn't
admit.
now
the
leading
case,
the
leading
case
here
on
the
proposition
that
it
is
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
to
expend
money
to
save
one's
business
from
destruction
is
of
course
commissioner
against
heininger
in
the
320th
united
states,
and
we
think
that
is
the
leading
case
and
we
discussed
it
at
some
length.
and
again,
the
government
reflexly
agrees
with
us
because
they
don't
state
the
heininger
case,
they
don't
discuss
it,
they
cite
it
twice
as
a
compare
and
wants
us
to
see
also.
now,
this
being
a
measure
that
threatened
the
taxpayer's
business
which
we
think
as
a
matter
of
law
involved
in
expenditures
that's
ordinary
and
necessary,
what
is
there
to
support
the
result
below?
well,
there's
a
regulation.
there
is
a
three-throng
regulation
and
i
will
take
each
of
the
throngs
in
order.
first,
it
says
that
some
spent
for
lobby
may
not
be
deducted.
well,
we
don't
quarrel
with
that
at
all.
lobbying
in
the
sense
of
the
use
of
personal
influence
on
and
personal
solicitation
of
members
of
a
legislature
is
so
far
against
public
policy
that
a
contract
for
it
is
unenforceable
and
it's
been
held
here
over
many
years.
and
of
course
in
the
textile
mills
case
in
the
314th
united
states,
that
regulation
was
sustained.
now
we
say,
the
decision
goes
on
the
unenforceability,
on
the
--
the
--
of
lobbying.
the
fact
that
lobbying
is
against
public
policy
on
the
illegality
of
the
practice
because
the
opinions
speaks
of
insidious
influences
and
legislative
halls
and
that
family
of
contracts
to
which
the
law
has
given
those
sanction.
and
of
course
if
it's
unenforceable,
it's
illegal
and
we
don't
borrow
of
course
with
the
regulation
that
says
that
kind
of
an
expenditure
is
not
ordinary
and
necessary.
but,
when
the
regulation
goes
on
to
condemn
some
spent
for
the
promotion
or
defeat
of
legislation
not
involving
lobbying,
then
we
have
something
else.
we
have
a
two-fold
argument
on
that
branch
of
the
regulation.
we
say
first,
it's
invalid
and
second,
that
if
it's
thought
to
be
applied
to
an
initiative
provision,
it
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
says
the
expenditures
are
not
deductible
and
we
say
the
only
way
you
can
properly
deny
an
expenditure
which
in
every
other
way
qualifies
within
the
statute
is
because
of
the
semblance
of
the
illegality,
the
textile
mills
lobby,
the
tank
truck
rentals
penalty,
but
--
but
that
to
say
that
simply
because
the
activity
concerns
legislation,
it
is
not
ordinary
and
necessary
we
think
is
arbitrary.
it
--
it
say
--
it
carves
out,
attempts
to
carve
out
one
particular
type
of
expenditure
without
any
reasonable
ground
for
differentiation.
now
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
we
make
only
the
--
we
make
only
the
point
that
a
--
an
expenditure
and
--
and
i
will
narrow
--
narrow
my
arguments
to
the
sole
ground
that
is
necessary
here.
that
an
expenditure
made
by
a
taxpayer
to
save
his
business
from
destruction
does
not
cease
which
is
otherwise
deductible
under
the
rule
of
the
heininger
case.
it
doesn't
lose
its
deductibility
when
he
is
engaged
in
a
legitimate
over
an
open
effort
to
defeat
legislation
which
would
have
destroyed
that
business.
and
the
reason
is
this,
we
say
quite
briefly,
legislation
isn't
a
dirty
word.
now
contacts
for
lobbying
are
unenforceable
but
if
i
am
retained
by
a
client
to
appear
before
committees
and
procure
the
passage
of
legislations
even
if
i
have
that
contract
on
a
contingent
basis,
that
contract
is
enforceable,
that
contract
is
valid
and
this
court
has
upheld
those
contracts
so
that
there
is
nothing
reprehensible
about
legislative
activity
as
such.
there
is
no
taint
and
to
exclude
legitimate
legislative
activity
from
the
reach
of
the
statute
is
just
as
arbitrary
as
the
attempt
in
being
on
distrust
which
was
the
nonbusiness
expense
of
attempting
to
preserve
property
and
the
commissioner
had
said,
“yes.
you
can
deduct
all
the
expenses
incurred
in
protecting
your
property
except
--
except
in
expenses
incurred
in
fighting
an
additional
tax
assessment
which
we
put
upon
you.”
that's
wrong.
well
of
course,
the
court
held
that
invalid
because
it
was
contrary
to
the
statute
and
we
say
the
same
thing
is
here
as
long
you
don't
have
lobby.
now,
a
fortiori
when
you
get
--
and
this
is
the
second
thought
--
second
branch
of
our
argument
under
that
clause
of
the
regulation
when
you
get
to
legislation
pending
not
before
a
legislature
but
before
the
people,
then
you
have
something
entirely
different.
and
i
recall,
to
your
honors'
minds
the
--
the
tremendous
struggle
in
the
last
--
last
years
--
the
last
century
and
then
the
early
years
of
this
century
to
introduce
under
the
constitutions
of
so
many
states'
provisions
for
initiative
and
referendum.
and
the
purpose
was
--
the
purpose
was
to
free
the
people
from
the
frailties
of
their
legislators,
to
make
it
possible
for
the
people
to
legislate
directly,
and
to
make
it
impossible
for
particular
interests
to
buckle
up
measures
in
a
legislature
through
pressure
directed
against
a
very
few
people
so
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
a
great
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
of
--
of
course
not.
but
the
line
we've
drawn
and
the
--
and
i
will
answer
the
question
now.
the
line
we
draw
is
the
business
advertising.
now,
if
as
i
say,
if
my
clients
had
been
wholesale
florists
who
like
to
go
to
the
tavern,
they
couldn't
claim
this
as
a
business
expense.
the
regulation,
the
very
same
regulation
which
allows
trade
advertising
as
a
business
expense
denies
the
deduction
of
a
non-trade
advertising
and
i
don't
quarrel
with
that.
i
mean,
the
non-trade
advertising
isn't
a
business
expense.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
business
expense
of
something
to
save
the
business
from
destruction.
and
when
you
have
the
--
when
you're
dealing
with
an
initiative,
i
say
unless
you're
prepared
to
say
that
this
great
struggle
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
was
the
term
ballot,
then
there
is
a
--
a
marked
difference
between
legislation
pending
in
the
legislature
and
legislation
pending
before
the
entire
direct
and
that
to
--
to
say
as
the
government
does
that
here,
“oh,
well
the
people
were
the
legislators
is
to
--
could
realize
a
basic
distinction
and
to
resort
to
the
techniques
of
the
late
kurt
goldstein.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
sir.
that
is
--
your
honor
has
quoted
from
23
(o)
which
is
the
contribution
section.
we
are
claiming
under
23
(a)
the
business
expense
section.
there
are
three
basic
differences.
the
business
expense
deals
with
the
activity
of
the
taxpayer.
the
contribution
section
deals
with
the
activity
of
the
person
to
whom
the
payment
is
made.
the
two
subjects
are
entirely
different.
and
finally,
there
is
a
percentage
limitation
in
23
(o)
on
the
amount
of
contributions
that
can
be
taken
as
a
deduction
and
there
is
no
such
percentage
contribution
in
23
(a)
and
we
say
it
is
just
as
wrong
to
try
to
write
the
--
the
substantive
limitation
of
23
(o)
into
23
(a)
as
it
would
be
to
write
to
--
to
attempt
to
write
the
percentage
limitation
of
23
(o)
into
23
(a).
now
for
instance,
if
i
am
a
rockefeller,
rockefeller
,
i
cannot
give
60%
of
my
gross
income
to
worthy
charitable
causes
such
as
foundations,
colleges,
churches
and
the
like.
there's
a
limitation
in
percentage.
but
if
i
am
an
unsuccessful
businessman
with
a
poorly
developed
acquisitive
instinct
and
60%
of
my
gross
goes
for
expenses,
not
even
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
will
say,
(inaudible)
if
they're
otherwise
proper
expenditures.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
and
i
say
that
--
that
the
commissioner
can
no
more
write
the
percentage
limitation
of
subsection
o
into
subsection
a
than
he
can
write
the
substantive
limitations
on
contributions
into
a
business
expenses
that
are
otherwise
ordinary
and
necessary.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
we
don't
have
a
due
process,
sir.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
no.
i
think
the
regulation
is
invalid
because
it's
not
warranted
by
the
statute.
it's
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
--
the
statute
says
ordinary
and
necessary
and
although,
that
--
those
aren't
words
of
art.
but
we
do
know
that
ordinary
and
necessary
includes
expenditures
necessary
to
save
one's
business
even
if
that
business
is
as
doubtful
as
the
business
of
dr.
heininger
who
was
not
only
guilty
of
inaccurate
statements
to
pass
through
the
mails
but
also
a
very
incompetent
damage.
now,
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
the
attorney's
fee
to
try
to
keep
heininger
in
business.
he
was
facing
a
postal
fraud
order
and
if
your
honor
will
read
the
report
of
heininger
against
farley
in
the
105
f.2d,
you
will
see
that
the
postal
authorities
had
ample
grounds
for
shutting
him
down.
and
then
he
was
permitted
to
deduct
his
attorney's
fee
and
the
court
said,
“well,
his
business
was
about
to
be
destroyed.
the
normal
response
to
that
threat
was
to
try
to
save
his
business.
the
attorney's
fee
being
otherwise
reasonable,
he
can
deduct
it
even
though
in
fact
he
was
put
out
of
business.”
now,
this
was
just
as
much
a
threat
to
our
business
as
postmaster
general
farley
was
to
dr.
heininger's
business
and
there's
nothing
--
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
our
business.
our
business
was
lawful.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
i
know,
but
--
but
on
the
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
business
expense
section
that
says
efforts
to
influence
legislation
and
my
point
is
that
if
the
expenditure
is
otherwise
ordinary
and
necessary,
you
can't
single
it
out
on
the
ground
that
it
involved
efforts
to
influence
legislation
unless
those
efforts
transgress
the
lines
of
public
policies
so
that
they
became
efforts
of
lobbying
and
hands
on
enforcement.
and
--
and
that
--
that's
our
position
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
as
applied
to
legitimate
efforts
in
the
legislature
but
a
fortiori,
it
is
invalid
as
applied
to
attempts
to
--
where
the
legislation
is
pending
before
the
people
and
where
the
taxpayers
are
bringing
there
if
effort
is
to
saturate
the
thinking
of
the
community
and
not
simply
to
deal
with
the
legislature.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
form
of
direct
legislation.
now
in
the
case
of
luther
ely
smith
which
i
think
is
worth
more
than
passing
mention.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
a
tax
court
case.
luther
ely
smith
was
a
missouri
lawyer
who
thought
rightly
or
not,
i
cannot
say
that
the
public
had
lost
confidence
in
the
courts
and
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
and
he
spent
money
to
adopt
that
constitutional
amendment
and
the
tax
court
said
that
this
regulation
was
inapplicable,
no
action
by
the
legislature
was
necessary.
the
commissioner
acquiesced
and
that
acquiescence
remained
enforced
for
14
years
until
your
honors
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
and
then
the
commissioner
did
a
hasty
post
like
--
most
enlightened
flip-flop
and
said,
“oh
well,
the
constitutional
amendment
is
general
legislation
and
therefore
the
legislature
replied.”
but
we
say,
if
you
can
address
communications
relating
to
the
taxpayer's
business
to
the
public
to
say
drink
lots
of
beer
or
drink
acme
beer
or
drink
any
other
kind
of
krispy
kreme
thirst-quencher
and
that
is
the
proper
business
expense
then
to
say
that
when
you
address
a
--
an
appeal
to
them
to
vote
against
this
initiative
which
would
put
us
out
of
business,
that
would
raise
the
question
which
was
pointed
out
in
speiser
versus
randall,
that
there's
a
discrimination
among
identical
types
of
speech
and
that
certainly
would
raise
the
constitutional
question.
we
say
the
only
way
to
avoid
raising
that
question
is
to
construe
this
legislation
if
we
get
to
the
second
stage
of
the
argument
as
not
as
meaning
legislation
before
a
legislature
which
is
the
normal
sense
and
not
legislation
before
the
people.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
would
be
a
difference
of
degree
eventually
and
the
question
of
fact.
now
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
suppose
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
suppose
in
the
first
instance,
it
would
be
the
commissioner
and
then
the
tax
court
and
then
ultimately
this
court.
although
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
make
a
--
get
a
fact
question
here
on
certiorari
certainly
after
the
decision
of
10
days
ago.
but
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact
as
to
the
business
effect.
i
recur
to
my
wholesale
florist,
the
wholesale
florist
couldn't
claim
this.
the
wholesale
grocer
might
because
after
all
without
the
--
in
the
state
of
washington
the
wholesale
--
the
grocer
can
sell
beer.
the
manufacturer
of
tavern
equipment
i
think
could
raise.
it
would
be
a
question
of
degree
how
far
it
affects
business,
but
we
don't
have
to
decide
any
of
those
questions
on
where
to
draw
the
line
or
how
far
in
this
direction,
how
far
in
that
direction
because
here
we
have
something
clear.
this
would've
destroyed
their
business
or
at
least
there
was
a
90%
chance
that
they
would
have
been
among
the
wholesalers
who
would've
been
closed
down.
now,
finally
there
is
the
clause
of
the
regulation
that
deals
with
propaganda.
there
are
technical
object
--
obstacles
in
the
way
of
that
govern
--
argument
on
the
part
of
the
government
which
are
fully
discussed
in
the
brief.
i
think
it's
foreclosed
by
the
plaintiffs
and
i
won't
--
i'll
rest
on
my
brief
there.
but
let
me
briefly
deal
with
the
question
of
propaganda.
i
don't
think
it
adds
anything
except
an
epithet
because
after
all
what
is
propaganda?
in
a
sense,
any
appeal
to
the
people
can
be
labeled
propaganda.
i've
once
worked
for
a
cabinet
officer
since
deceased
who
had
a
very
simple
life,
anything
in
his
--
his
arguments
were
based
on
facts
and
his
opponents'
arguments
were
purely
propaganda.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
i
think
there's
a
--
in
the
companion
case,
they
quote
judge
learned
hand
in
the
slee
case,
42
f.2d
propaganda
being
a
polemic
to
denote
the
publicity
of
the
other
side.
i
think
--
i
think
the
other
propaganda,
the
other
fellow's
arguments
because
ultimately,
any
kind
of
appeal
to
the
people
and
that
is
what
an
argument
addressed
to
the
people
in
connection
with
an
initiative
is.
any
argument
addressed
to
the
people
in
--
in
a
census
propaganda,
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
federalist,
the
emancipation
proclamation,
any
attempt
to
persuade,
if
you
happen
not
to
like
the
--
the
context
of
it
is
propaganda.
but
what
we
have
here
is
business
propaganda.
business
propaganda
that
is
quite
like
any
other
kind
of
advertising
because
this
wasn't
a
--
an
argument
against
the
initiative
brought
by
the
rugged
individualist
who
didn't
want
the
--
the
state
of
washington
in
the
retail
beer
business.
this
was
a
--
a
campaign
by
the
people
who
would
have
been
placed
out
of
business.
and
there
again,
the
difficulty
with
the
government's
arguments
is
not
only
that
they
appear
to
denigrate
the
very
essence
of
popular
government
but
throughout,
consistently
and
not
accidentally,
they
are
ignoring
or
seeking
to
ignore
the
basic
business
aspect
of
the
taxpayer's
appeal
to
their
fellow
citizens
to
vote
down
this
measure
which
would
have
destroyed
their
business.
and
that's
why
we
think
that
the
judgment
below
was
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
i
think
it's
in
--
in
one
sense,
mr.
justice
it
goes
back
great
many,
many
years.
and
insofar
as
it
is
applied
to
--
in
the
--
to
--
in
the
contribution
section,
i
--
we
don't
quarrel
with
it.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
if
you
can
contribute
to
the
national
committee.
it's
different
from
contributing
to
--
to
georgetown
university
law
school.
and
--
and
when
the
--
when
congress
says
it's
got
to
be
an
educational,
charitable,
and
so
forth
the
institution,
i'm
not
troubled
by
the
regulation
which
says
this
excludes
propaganda.
but
this
has
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
corporate
regulation
has
never
been
under
business
expenses
except
for
one
year
since
1915
and
the
regulation,
the
--
against
propaganda
hasn't
been
in
the
individual
taxpayers'
regulations
until
1938.
and
the
--
it's
--
the
individual
regulation
has
always
been
under
contributions.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
suppose
that's
about
the
only
line
possible.
and
--
and
--
and
yet
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
i
don't
think
it's
disinterestedness.
they
--
the
--
the
very
core
of
this
case
is
the
--
is
the
deep
and
sharp
interest
that
the
petitioners
had
in
the
preservation
of
their
business.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
if
--
it's
utterly
unsatisfactory.
it's
utterly
--
it
doesn't
add
anything
except
an
epithet.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
court
please.
i
was
about
to
say
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
namely
that
mr.
davis
kept
as
far
away
from
the
heininger
case
and
from
the
business
effect
of
this
initiative
on
my
client's
business
in
his
argument
as
his
colleagues
did
in
their
brief,
and
he
talked
public
subvention.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
public
subvention
of
legislative
activity
anymore
than
the
decision
in
the
heininger
amounted
to
public
subvention
of
third
rates
and
fraudulent
dentists.
now
about
these
advertisements
in
the
allegation
which
is
an
afterthought
that
the
source
wasn't
revealed.
in
the
first
place,
the
argument
circulated
against
the
initiative
that
state
expends
under
the
washington
statute
particularly
pointed
out
at
100
page,
101
of
this
record
that
it
would
put
a
lot
of
people
out
of
business
including
not
only
the
beer
capitalists
but
the
poor
working
men
and
the
laborers
who
carted
the
kegs
and
who
brewed
the
beer
and
who
turned
the
handles
on
the
--
at
the
bar.
now,
so
the
business
interests
of
these
people
was
clearly
expressed.
men
and
women
against
prohibition,
who
is
to
say
whether
that
wasn't
an
accurate
collective
description
of
the
people
who
contributed.
the
important
thing
here
is
that
the
composition
of
the
group
was
never
mentioned
at
the
trial.
it
was
never
litigated.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
everything
that
was
done
was
perfectly
legitimate.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
advertisements
were
not
in
the
printed
record
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
weren't
brought
here
in
any
form
until
after
certiorari
was
granted.
and
of
course
it
isn't
surprising
that
being
afterthoughts
they
--
these
arguments
have
some
very
obvious
defects.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
possibly
so
but
that's
a
further
step.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
--
if
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
in
one
sense,
it
might
be,
in
another
sense,
it
might
not
be.
now,
the
mcdonald
case,
the
campaign
expenditures
back
in
323
u.s.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
but
the
--
the
prevailing
opinion
said
his
expenses
were
incurred
not
in
being
a
judge
but
in
trying
to
become
one.
there
might
be
a
difference
there
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
might
also
be
this
line.
suppose
a
concerned
puts
out
a
new
product,
why
can't
it
--
is
its
deductibility
for
advertising
expenses
limited
to
existing
products
or
can
forth
--
put
out
the
ad
so
on
trying
to
sell
that
to
the
public.
also
on
the
shackles,
we
--
there
is
a
case
that
we
have
cited,
a
very
interesting
case
in
the
house
of
lords
where
a
--
and
in
england,
they
have
virtually
the
same
ordinary
and
necessary
deductibility
provision
that
we
have
here.
the
difference
is
verbal,
there
is
no
difference
in
substance.
this
was
a
firm
of
sugar
manufacturers
who
campaigned
to
resist
nationalization
by
the
british
parliament.
and
the
house
of
lords
said
the
money
expended
to
resist
that
nationalization
was
an
expense
incurred
to
save
their
business
and
therefore
it
was
deductible.
but
the
--
the
point
here
is
we
don't
have
to
delimit
at
this
time
the
outer
reaches
of
the
contention
that
my
clients
are
making.
all
we
are
relying
on
is
the
heininger
case,
the
doctrine
of
a
right
of
business
self-defense
to
protect
an
existing
business
against
destruction,
and
to
protect
it
against
destruction
by
appealing
to
the
people
and
not
appealing
to
the
legislature.
now,
that
being
so,
whether
the
arguments
are
lurid
as
my
brother
davis
contends,
whether
they
were
"lurid"
in
response
to
some
rather
extreme
views
put
forth
in
there
on
the
record
by
the
proponents
of
the
--
of
the
measure,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
decide
because
i
take
it
that's
the
--
the
merit
of
the
argument
isn't
the
deciding
factor
whether
you
have
the
right
to
make
it
nor
in
this
case,
whether
you
have
the
right
to
deduct
the
cost.
