justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gravatt.
justice
potter
stewart
any
proceedings
have
been
initiated
in
the
state
courts
with
respect
to
33
and
36?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
their
status?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
then
of
the
availability
of
that
kind
of
a
remedy?
justice
potter
stewart
and
pending
final
decision
by
the
state
court,
would
the
courts
have
power
to
issue
any
restraining
or
injunctive
orders
necessary?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
in
mind
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
you
to
say
the
statute
requires
that
the
--
that
the
person
have
any
--
have
any
intent
to
cause
violence?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
do,
sir.
but
as
i
understand
it,
you're
not
then
saying
that
the
statute
requires
that
there
be
an
intent
to
cause
racial
--
racial
violence
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
read
it
to
me?
justice
potter
stewart
basically
the
advise,
it
appears
on
page
93
doesn't
it,
since
chapters
33
and
36
are
vague
and
ambiguous
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
do
not
pass
upon
their
constitutionality,
that's
the
basic
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
marshall,
on
the
question
of
equitable
abstention,
could
you
make
clear
to
me,
because
it's
not
now
clear,
what
prejudice
to
the
appellees
would
ensue
if
the
district
court
should
retain
jurisdiction,
pending
a
determination
on
a
construction
of
an
interpretation
of
these
statutes
by
the
courts
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
has
already
done
that
with
respect
to
33
and
36,
what
prejudice
if
any
would
follow
if
the
same
thing
were
done
with
31,
32
and
35?
and
also
in
view
of
what
i
understood
mr.
gravatt
say
and
that
is
that
pending
a
final
determination
by
the
state
courts,
there
would
be
no
proceedings
would
be
initiated
under
any
of
this
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn't
that
equally
true
of
33
and
36?
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
and
as
to
those,
the
district
court
did
exactly
what
mr.
gravatt
is
arguing
that
should
be
done
with
these
other
three.
and
since
the
district
court
did
so,
what
additional
prejudice
would
ensue
if
the
same
thing
were
done
with
these
other
three?
justice
potter
stewart
there
have
been
in
the
state
courts
of
virginia,
have
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
fully
and
appreciate
what
you've
said.
perhaps
i
didn't
express
myself
clearly
in
my
question
in
any
event,
i
don't
know
that
you
--
you've
have
answered
it
completely.
my
point
is
this
that
since
the
district
court
did
refer
to
the
state
courts
33
and
36,
from
which
you've
taken
no
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
but
prejudice
would
be
involved
if
the
same
thing
were
now
done
with
the
balance
of
these.
justice
potter
stewart
just
--
it
would
--
the
sword
is
there
now
though,
isn't
it,
with
33
and
36?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
the
federal
court
had
made
it
effective
by
temporary
injunction.
