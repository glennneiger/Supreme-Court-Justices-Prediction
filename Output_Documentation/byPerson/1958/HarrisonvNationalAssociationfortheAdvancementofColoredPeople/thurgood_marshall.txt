mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
one
point
i
feel
obliged
to
correct
on
the
question
about
the
reason
for
sending
chapter
36
over
to
the
state
court.
mr.
gravatt,
i
am
certain
inadvertently
read
from
the
dissenting
opinion
of
record
119.
the
opinion,
i
understood
the
question
to
be,
why
did
the
court
do
it?
and
the
court
i
assume
was
intended
to
be
the
district
court,
the
majority.
and
the
question
about
chapter
36
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
of
judges
soper
and
judge
hoffman
appears
on
pages
91
through
93
is
the
reason
for
those
statutes
going
out.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
it's
pretty
hard
to
put
it
as
the
one
reason,
i
--
because
when
you
start
on
91
and
run
over
to
92
as
i
remember,
its
obscure
and
difficult
to
understand
what
the
general
purpose
seems
to
be.
i
think
the
whole
purpose
and
the
language
tied
up
together
made
it
quite
difficult
for
any
court
to
--
any
federal
court
rather,
to
properly
interpret
it.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
it's
time
in
this
case
to
put
these
statutes
into
proper
perspective.
that
is,
these
are
just
not
run
of
the
mill
statutes
that
came
down
the
road,
at
least
not
statutes
concerning
any
speed
limits.
it's
a
statute
concerning,
as
mr.
gravatt
said
on
one
side,
they
charges
as
with
the
effort
to
tie
the
hands
of
virginia.
there
is
nothing
in
record
on
that
but
the
record
is
replete
what
the
deliberate
calculated
purpose
of
the
executive
and
legislative
department
of
virginia
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
the
record
will
show
that
immediately
after
the
may
17th
decision
of
this
court,
in
the
brown
case,
and
i
want
to
pinpoint
one
question
there
and
that
is
that
in
those
four
decisions
was
the
prince
edward
county
case
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
and
immediately
after
those
opinions,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
started
out
to
do
the
opposite
of
what
this
court
said
september
in
the
cooper
case,
the
little
rock
case.
the
cooper
case
said
that
the
brown
decision
imposed
upon
all
agencies
of
government
in
a
state
and
here
it
would
apply
to
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
and
the
court
from
your
decision
in
the
cooper
case,
“a
duty
to
devote
every
effort
toward
initiating
desegregation
and
bringing
about
the
elimination
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
public
school
system."
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
a
positive
duty
on
the
state
to
proceed
toward
compliance
with
the
decision
of
this
court.
yet
in
the
state
where
one
of
the
cases
actually
came
from,
the
governor
and
the
legislature
of
virginia
with
the
active
support
of
nearly
every
political
faction
in
the
state
set
about
to
do
just
the
opposite.
and
the
record
shows
it
and
the
district
court
found
it.
and
they
first
had
what
became
known
and
is
in
the
record
and
is
in
the
opinion,
virginia
started
upon
massive
resistance.
this
massive
resistance
involved
two
main
causes,
one
was
the
enactment
of
a
pupil
assignment
law
in
an
effort
to
get
around
the
brown
decision.
then
they
enacted
laws
closing
and
cutting
off
the
funds
supporting
non-segregated
public
schools.
then
they
passed
other
implementing
laws.
all
of
them
directed
toward
making
it
well
(inaudible)
possible
for
white
and
negro
children
to
attend,
to
go
to
any
school
within
the
state,
this
is
all
in
the
record.
the
other
course
consisted
in
the
enactment
of
laws
designed
to
exterminate
at
least
in
virginia
the
two
organizations
which
had
assisted
in
school
litigation
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
lawyers
to
represent
these
people
in
these
cases,
unless
the
plaintiffs
themselves
had
some
connection
with
the
lawsuit.
and
we
have
these
--
a
lot
of
cases,
i
mean
statutes
before
us
today.
and
the
constitutionality
of
these
statutes
as
said
in
the
opening
argument
for
the
appellants
must
be
all
considered
in
the
atmosphere,
well
let's
consider
them,
as
they
were
enacted.
on
august
the
30th,
1954
the
governor
of
virginia
appointed
a
commission
on
public
education
to
study
the
brown
decision
of
this
court
and
to
make
recommendations.
and
on
record,
the
record
turning
to
page
55,
there
appears
the
report
and
the
commission
declared
that
the
decision
of
this
court
means
that
the
most
fundamental
rights
of
the
states
and
of
their
citizens
exist
by
the
court
sufferings
and
that
the
law
of
the
land
is
whatever
the
court
maybe
determined
to
be
by
the
process
of
judicial
legislation.
and
the
commission
further
included
again
on
page
55
that
separate
faculties
in
our
public
schools
are
in
the
best
interest
of
both
races,
educationally
and
otherwise
and
the
compulsory
integration
should
be
resisted
by
all
proper
means
in
our
power,
which
i
gather
from
mr.
gravatt
means
that
any
law
passed
by
the
state,
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
for
this
purpose
is
insulated
from
attack,
any
place
other
than
in
the
same
commonwealth.
and
the
commission
recommended
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
indeed,
they
had
one
beginning
on
february
1
of
1936.
and
there,
they
passed
there
interposition
resolution
stating
that
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
“emphatically
disapproves”
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
brown
case,
which
they
characterized
as
a
deliberate,
culpable,
and
dangerous
attempt
of
the
court
itself
to
use
of
the
mandatory
power.
and
the
on
the
record
at
518
it
will
show
that
if
this
--
if
the
resolution
challenges
the
usurped
authority
that
would
inflict
upon
their
citizens
the
consequences
of
that
decision,
and
then
pledged,
“our
firm
intention
to
take
all
appropriate
measures
honorably,
legally
and
constitutionally
available
to
us,
to
resist
this
illegal
encroachment
upon
our
sovereign
powers.”
it's
on
522
--
520.
and
then
the
general
assembly
was
actually
called
into
general
session
on
exposition
on
august
27th
pursuant
to
the
requirement
of
the
constitution
and
the
governor
shall
recommend
to
the
assembly
what
should
be
done.
and
the
governor
did
declare
that,
“i
am
before
you
today
for
the
purpose
of
submitting
recommendations
to
continue
our
system
of
segregated
public
schools,”
page
626.
and
later
on
page
633
and
634
of
the
record,
the
governor
said,
“the
proposed
legislation
recognizes
the
fact
that
this
is
a
time
for
a
decisive
and
clear
answer
to
these
questions.
(1)
do
we
accept
the
attempt
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
without
constitutional
or
any
other
legal
basis,
to
usurp
the
rights
of
the
states
and
dictate
the
administration
of
their
internal
affairs?
(2)
do
we
accept
integration?
(3)
do
we
want
to
permit
the
destruction
of
our
schools
by
permitting
'a
little
integration'
and
witness
its
subsequent
sure
and
certain
insidious
spread
throughout
the
commonwealth?”
the
governor
then
said,
“my
answer
is
a
positive
no."
and
on
the
other
hand,
shall
we
take
all
appropriate
measures
honorably,
legally,
and
constitutionally
available
to
us,
to
resist
this
illegal
encroachment
upon
our
sovereign
powers?"
my
answer
to
this
is
a
definite
yes.
i
believe
it
is
to
be
the
answer
of
the
people
of
virginia,
etcetera,
etcetera,
the
end
of
the
quote
of
the
government.
and
in
response
to
this
assertion
the
legislature
did
enact
a
whole
series
of
statutes
and
what
was
characterized
by
the
district
court
in
its
findings
as
a
“general
plan
to
obstruct
the
integration
of
the
races
in
schools
of
virginia,
of
which
plan
the
statutes
in
suit
constitute
an
important
part.”
and
there,
the
pupil
assigned
with
law
and
the
other
things
(inaudible).
the
importance
of
this
legislative
history
if
it
could
be
called
that,
i
don't
consider
it
legislative
history
because
it's
too
close
in
hand
to
the
history,
was
that
on
one
hand
every
effort
would
be
made
through
pupil
assignment,
cut
off
of
funds,
every
means
they
could
think
of
to
prevent
integration
on
a
voluntary
basis
or
any
other
basis,
once
having
done
that,
the
--
a
general
assembly
of
virginia
obviously
realized
that
they
had
then
shut
the
door
on
every
possible
means
of
getting
it
done
except
by
public
meetings,
political
actions,
and
resort
to
the
courts.
so
near
the
end
of
that
session
we
get
these
five
statutes.
these
five
statutes,
31
first
of
all,
there
is
no
question
about
who
it's
aimed
at.
and
indeed
the
district
court
found
as
to
what
organization
it
was
aimed
at.
it
moves
into
the
theory
of
requiring
the
listing
of
members,
the
other
things
about
listing
of
corporation
papers
or
public
documents
anyhow,
would
be
one
thing.
but
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
alabama
case,
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
and
i
notice
that
there
is
not
too
much
argument
on
the
other
side
about
it,
about
the
merits
of
this.
the
only
argument
is
let
it
go
to
the
state
courts,
because
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
argument.
the
difference
mr.
justice
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand
is
that
in
the
meantime
the
irreparable
injury
is
there
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
at
this
point.
once
the
membership
list
is
released
and
under
this
statute
is
made
public,
then
the
interference
with
the
first
amendment
rights
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
alabama
case
immediately
take
effect
as
of
the
adoption
of
the
statute,
because
this
statute
in
the
light
of
its
purpose,
in
light
of
the
record
in
this
case,
is
in
the
same
category
as
a
self
executing
statute
which
this
court
has
uniformly
struck
down.
such
self
executing
statutes
has
appeared
in
the
pierce
case,
pierce
against
the
sisters,
and
if
it
please
the
court,
the
interesting
thing
about
that
case
about
going
over
to
the
state
court.
that
case
was
filed,
decided,
appealed
to
this
court
and
decided
before
it
became
effective,
before
it
even
became
effective.
the
second
case
is
the
truax
against
raich
case,
in
which
it
held
the
mere
passing
of
the
statute
that
interfered
with
the
rights
of
the
aliens
to
work,
that
without
enforcement
the
passage
of
the
statute
would
make
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
get
a
job
if
he
were
an
alien.
and
the
third
case
is
the
decision
more
recently
of
this
of
court
in
barrows
against
jackson,
which
involved
restrictive
covenants
and
came
from
california.
in
this
particular
case,
these
statutes
once
passed
with
the
conditions
as
they
existed
in
virginia,
as
shown
by
the
record
and
as
found
by
the
court,
meant
that
from
that
day
on,
membership
would
be
impossible
and
that
plus
the
fact
that
if
the
membership
list
whatever
left,
that
--
i
mean
released,
that's
a
different
point.
but
the
mere
passage
of
the
statute
creates
the
damage
to
these
first
amendment
rights,
the
freedom
of
assembly,
etcetera.
and,
i
think
it's
significant
that
there
is
little
argument
against
that.
in
section
--
the
chapter
32
to
the
same
extent
requiring
the
handing
over
of
this
information
runs
into
the
same
category
of
interfering
with
the
rights
of
freedom
of
association
and
it's
very
interesting
that
in
chapter
32,
while
objecting
and
prohibiting
all
types
of
action
toward
political
activities,
it's
significant
that
the
statute
particularly
exempts
all
political
parties
and
it
significantly
didn't
name
them,
it
just
exempts
all
political
parties.
and
if
the
court
pleases
on
chapter
35,
you
really
get
the
exact
purpose
of
the
whole
package
of
bills.
for
if
they
can,
one,
in
31
and
32
prevent
these
organizations
from
being
organizations
and
existing,
and
if
they
can
prevent
money
from
being
used
in
litigation,
that
should
do
the
job,
but
chapter
35
goes
a
step
further,
and
says
that
any
rates
the
lawyers
are
going
to
be
in
trouble
in
any
organization,
that
participates,
even
if
you
get
over
all
of
the
other
hurdles.
i
think
that
this
court
must
recognize
that
when
we
talk
about
free
access
to
the
court,
and
when
we
find
that
as
far
back
as
crandall
against
nevada,
there
have
been
other
cases
since
that
time,
free
access
must
mean
access.
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
need
for
the
record
showing,
but
it
does
show
that
this
litigation
cost
considerable
money.
and
if,
as
virginia
would
have
it
done,
the
doors
of
the
court
are
open,
but
it
is
only
open
to
those
who
are
able
to
finance
litigation.
the
doors
would
effectively
be
reasonably
closed,
because
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
in
virginia,
you
have
a
line
of
litigation
which
on
one
side
has
the
whole
panoply
of
the
state
government,
the
entire
attorney
general's
office,
the
county
lawyers
for
each
county
and
the
treasury
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
to
support
it.
now
i
believe
that
in
any
such
litigation,
i
don't
believe
anybody
could
imagine
that
a
poor
individual
or
--
not
a
--
i
don't
mean
poor
as
a
pauper,
but
there
are
very
few
individuals
that
could
cope
with
that
side
of
money.
and
so
the
reason
for
31
and
32
is
to
cut
off
the
money.
the
answer
of
course
made
in
their
brief
and
made
in
part
in
argument
is
that
in
35
all
they
are
doing
is
just
codifying
the
law
of
barratry.
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
they
did
just
the
opposite.
for
the
common
lore
of
barratry,
of
maintenance,
and
champerty,
it's
confusing
as
it
might
be
at
times
of
the
overlapping
of
the
three.
there's
never
been
any
question,
although
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
of
a
lawyer,
if
it's
not
for
personal
or
what
have
you
gained
to
himself,
to
be
able
to
render
his
legal
services
for
the
benefit
of
his
community.
it's
never
been
any
question
and
if
there
were
any
question,
in
chapter
35
they
go
into
the
most
minute
detail
to
accept
everybody
from
the
statute
but
the
naacp.
for
example,
legal
aid
societies
are
specifically
exempt,
everybody
else
is
exempted,
so
obviously
the
legislature
realized
exactly
what
it
was
doing.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
difference
was
that
33
and
36
had
those
two
sections
which
are
set
on
page
91
and
92,
and
runs
over
to
--
stops
at
the
bottom
of
page
91.
i
think
that
the
district
--
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
they
were
so
ambiguous
and
i
think
it's
a
judgment
as
between
the
two
which
the
district
court
made,
which
i
think
is
very
significant.
and
that
the
court
did
not
just
cast
aside
the
abstention
or
judicial
self
restraint
doctrine,
they
actually
applied
it.
you
see
the
language
especially
on
93,
the
instigation
or
suit
or
to
whether
the
giving
of
money
to
needy
litigants
amounts
to
an
inducement.
that
language
as
i
understand
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
that
the
language
in
35
has
no
possibility
of
ambiguity
because
it
starts
off,
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
you'll
notice
in
the
beginning
the
statutes
are
in
the
back
of
the
appellant's
brief.
they
start
off
with
the
definition
in
the
very
beginning
on
35
and
they
run
on
and
on
and
on,
they
took
great
pains
to
--
appears
on
appendix
page
9.
i
think
that's
the
--
it's
pretty
hard
to
find
ambiguity
in
chapter
35.
notice
mr.
justice
harlan
on
appendix
page
10,
all
of
the
exemptions
under
there
i
think
that
helps
to
clarify
it.
but
that's
the
basis
of
the
sending
over
the
two
statutes,
and
if
i
may
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i'll
state
our
position
clearly
on
the
points
about
sending
them
over
to
the
state
court.
in
the
brief
the
appellants
put
it
on
two
points.
one
is,
that
where
there
is
need
for
construction
and
the
other
is
--
well,
these
are
criminal
statutes
and
that
equity
and
especially
the
federal
equitable
cause
do
not
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
criminal
statutes
even
if
they're
unconstitutional.
and
in
that
particular
argument,
in
their
brief,
it's
a
very
good
statement
as
far
as
it
goes,
the
end
of
it
is
unless
there
are
exceptional
circumstances.
and
we
alleged
exceptional
circumstances.
we
produced
testimony
on
exceptional
circumstances
and
the
district
court
found
exceptional
circumstances.
secondly,
as
i
understand
mr.
gravatt's
argument,
he
said
that
all
they're
arguing
for
is
that
the
case
go
back
to
be
held
by
the
district
court
while
it's
litigated
in
the
state
courts
and
that's
of
course
is
not
the
rule
of
--
it's
a
criminal
statute
and
there
hasn't
been
a
prosecution
then
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
so
on
the
prosecution
point,
we
think
that
the
three
cases
i
mentioned,
the
sisters,
truax
against
raich,
and
the
barrows
against
jackson
take
care
of
that
point
of
the
lack
of
prosecution.
on
the
point
that
as
to
the
general
enforcement,
i
think
the
irreparable
injuries
that
are
in
this
record
are
there
because
it's
not
there
is
to
be
a
threat
of
prosecution
of
these
corporations
that
is
the
evil
inherent
in
these
statutes,
it
is
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
statutes
on
the
books
prevent
the
members,
the
contributors,
and
the
people
that
make
the
organization
move
from
cooperating
with
the
organizations,
the
presence
of
the
statute
will
do
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
they
mention
all
are
summed
up
in
watson
against
buck.
and
if
the
court
pleases,
we
take
the
position
that
watson
against
buck
is
not
at
all
controlling
in
this
case
because
in
the
case
of
watson
against
buck,
there
were
40
odd
sections
of
that
statute
that
ran
some
30
pages
in
the
record.
i
would
--
i
think
the
court
when
it
said
that
it
was
an
evolved
statute,
really
used
the
correct
language.
and
in
that
particular
one,
there
was
no
showing
of
irreparable
harm
which
would
negate
the
need
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court.
and
the
court
did
reverse
it,
send
it
back,
and
ordered
it
dismissed.
i
think
that
the
argument
so
far
is
that
the
court
should
use
the
doctrine
of
abstention
or
judicial
self
restraint.
i
haven't
--
their
brief
pays
very
little
attention
to
the
basic
rights
here
involved
which
are
these
rights.
one,
that
these
statutes
interfere
with
first
amendment
rights
or
freedom
of
association
and
freedom
of
expression.
they
also
violate
the
right
of
freedom
of
excess
to
the
courts.
they
also
violate
the
right
summed
up
in
the
liberty
to
pursue
your
profession,
your
business
or
what
have
you.
we
also
take
the
position
secondly
that
that
being
true,
the
appellants
even
if
it
might
have
been
possible
to
show
it
and
so
far
by
the
record,
their
brief
and
argument
been
unable
to
show
the
basis
for
the
invokement
--
invoking
of
the
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention.
in
the
first
place,
the
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention
is
in
equitable
doctrine
and
here
you
have
is
clearly
as
you
ever
will
have
the
statement
of
the
lawyer
for
the
appellants
that
virginia
must
have
the
right
to
stop
compliance
with
this
court's
decision.
but
if
you
are
going
to
balance
equities,
i
don't
have
any
problem
when
that
statement
is
made
clear.
in
addition,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
when
these
statutes
were
passed,
the
prince
edward
case
had
been
returned
to
the
district
court
and
indeed
it's
still
there.
and
if
these
statutes
are
constitutional
and
are
applied,
this
court
and
the
district
court
are
effectively
denied
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
whatever
might
happen
in
the
prince
edward
county
case
because
there's
nobody
else
to
finance
it.
it
also
is
shown
in
the
record
and
it's
shown
in
judge
soper's
opinion,
the
number
of
cases
pending
in
virginia
admittedly
financed
or
financial
assistance
given
by
the
two
appellants,
appellees
herein.
and
every
one
of
them
is
a
federal
tort
case.
i
think
that
when
this
court
says
that
there
are
times
when
restraint
should
be
used,
i
would
be
the
last
one
to
object.
i
mean
i
--
i've
always
agreed,
but
the
question
as
to
when
it
is
to
be
exercised
and
as
of
this
moment
record,
briefs,
and
argument,
i
say
the
state
of
--
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
hasn't
yet
shown
even
the
basis
for
exercising
it,
let
alone
than
to
use
it,
i'm
raising
the
consideration
in
this
case
yet.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
because
--
i
wouldn't
assume
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
i
don't
think
ever
get
to
that
point.
i'm
not
arguing
that
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
theory
is
that
there
is
no
construction
that
can
save
this.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
the
last
clause
by
itself
would
be
meaningless,
and
i
agree
that
judge
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
with
judge
soper
that
it's
that
vague.
it
is
in
the
vague
status
where
it
is
--
is
--
it's
unconstitutional
because
of
vagueness.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
that
it
needs
construction.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
the
other
hand
that
--
that's
a
different
point
if
i
may,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
construes
it
on
the
state
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it
pleases
the
court
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
should
go
that
far,
because
if
the
court
wants
--
takes
the
position
that
there
is
--
although
the
court
cannot
imagine
it,
and
nobody
else
can
imagine
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
we
--
we
have
said
to
this
opinion,
i
can't
imagine
a
court
doing
it,
and
my
point
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
--
that
if
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
-
i
don't
say
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
--
and
further
mr.
justice
frankfurter
really
that
position
adds
up
to
this.
and
it's
more
clearly
set
out
throughout
the
brief
than
in
the
argument,
that
is
that
anytime
a
statute
comes
up,
if
it
is
--
hasn't
been
construed
by
a
state
court,
the
federal
court
should
not
touch
it
until
it's
construed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
certainly
agree
sir.
but
the
--
the
point
to
me
is
that
i
think
that
this
court
has
a
perfect
right
to
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
should
be
applied
in
this
case,
that
i
recognize.
i
also
recognize
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
real
substantial
basis
for
that,
i
think
that's
my
position
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
because
otherwise
the
district
courts
would
be
almost
completely
prevented
from
hearing
the
cases
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
state
statutes.
and
in
these
cases
where
the
statute
itself,
there
is
no
question,
there
might
be
questions
on
what
mr.
gravatt
was
saying,
as
to
whether
this
statute
might
not
apply
to
somebody
else,
but
there
is
no
question
that
these
statutes
apply
appellees.
there's
no
question
that
--
that
anybody
can
get
out.
and
this
case
is
a
case
seeking
an
injunction
because
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
two
appellees.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
what
the
district
court
held.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
is
true
sir.
well
this
one
--
my
position
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
this
one
clearly
applies
to
the
two
appellees,
the
record
shows
it.
and
the
record
also
shows
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no,
sir.
the
--
the
interesting
thing
though
to
show
from
the
record
in
this
case,
the
justification
for
the
statute,
i
mean
the
argument
was
made
that
this
statute
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public
from
fraud,
there's
not
one
word
in
the
testimony
in
the
record
on
it,
not
one
single
word.
the
justification
for
the
statute,
for
the
barratry
statute,
if
it
please
the
court,
for
this
barratry
statute
here
is
a
witness
who
testified
that
he
was
the
head
of
the
examiners
for
the
railroad
association.
and
they
needed
this
type
of
statute
to
protect
the
railroads
from
trumped
up
litigation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
--
mr.
justice
there
are
quite
a
few
other
justices
on
that
point.
the
point
though
if
your
honor
please,
i
mean,
if
it
please
the
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
do
think
that
it
is
important
to
this
case
to
recognize
for
example
as
to
whether
or
not
these
statutes
apply
to
us,
to
the
appellees
here
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
hazardous,
but
i
think
that
on
the
other
side
that
where
even
doing
that
procedure
you
find
admissions
that
are
helpful
to
one
side,
i
think
i
like
to
use
them.[laughter]
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
afraid
that's
--
for
example,
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
testified
and
admitted
that
in
this
cross-examination
that
he
came
up
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
giving
testimony
against
the
naacp.
not
in
--
not
--
not
in
favor
of
the
statutes.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
but
that
the
statutes
apply
to
the
appellees
here.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
statutes
do
interfere
with
these
particular
rights
that
i
have
set
aside,
that's
freedom
of
expression,
freedom
of
association,
access
to
the
courts,
and
liberty
to
follow
your
profession
or
business
without
unlawful
restraint
by
the
state.
i
think
the
real
difference
between
mr.
gravatt's
argument
and
our
argument
is
that
he
takes
the
position
that
the
state
in
order
to
“maintain
peace”
can
do
anything.
and
we
maintain
that
whatever
the
state
does
through
its
legislature
has
to
be
measured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
insofar
as
this
particular
point
is
concerned,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
real
basic
difference
between
the
two.
i
don't
see
the
--
any
offer
that's
been
made
by
the
state
that
--
that
requires
this
court
to
excise
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
--
there
are
two
answers
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
first
one
is
that
under
the
pierce
and
the
other
two
cases
i
mentioned,
truax
and
barrows,
these
self
executing
statutes,
the
injury
starts
whether
you
have
enforcement
or
not.
in
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
injury
could
possibly
yes,
yes,
yes,
certainly.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
--
the
difference
is
that
in
this
particular
case
we
have
an
injunction
which
protects
for
example,
bear
in
mind
that
the
people
i'm
worried
about
in
this
particular
litigation
not
the
appellees
as
such.
but
among
them
are
the
lawyers
and
it's
pretty
hard
for
a
lawyer
to
take
the
prince
edward
case
which
is
a
case
decided
by
this
court
and
further
litigate
while
he
was
going
to
the
state
courts.
he'd
be
in
trouble
with
this
problem
and
what
have
you,
providing
the
statute
was
upheld.
he'd
be
in
considerable
trouble
and
i
--
i'm
not
to
sure
that
it's
the
job
of
a
lawyer
to
deliberately
violate
a
law
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
i
think
he's
one
of
the
few
people
that's
--
a
law
is
a
law.
and
it's
our
position
that
to
go
over
into
the
state
courts
would
be
one
of
them.
but
i
say
that
this
court
must
not
ignore
the
fact
that
here
is
a
state
deliberately
interfering
with
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts.
and
i
don't
believe
that's
the
business
of
a
state
court.
i
believe
it's
the
peculiar
business
of
the
federal
court
to
see
to
it
that
its
doors
are
open.if
a
state
passed
a
law
preventing
litigants
from
coming
into
a
federal
court
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
about
it.
and
these,
the
history
and
the
statutes
themselves
when
they
say
cases
involving
racial,
what
have
you,
it's
obviously
they
are
talking
about
the
federal
courts,
there
had
been
no
cases
in
the
state
courts
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
and
recently
in
the
state
court
of
virginia
was
the
statute
--
the
case
i
mentioned
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
was
not
--
the
negroes
didn't
bring
that
case,
the
state
of
virginia
brought
it
for
interpretation
of
the
statute,
some
state
office
had
brought
it,
we
didn't.
the
only
cases
that
are
in
this
record
are
federal
court
cases
and
if
they
can
keep
litigation
out
of
the
federal
courts,
they
can
maintain
their
massive
resistance.
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
get
to
the
point
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
sent
over.
i
don't
think
a
case
has
been
made
for
the
implication
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
prejudice
would
be
done
on
two
ways.
one
is
that
the
sword
of
damocles
hanging
over
the
plaintiffs
--
the
appelles
in
this
case
would
just
be
hanging
a
little,
that's
one.
number
two.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
with
33
and
36
as
i
read
those
statutes
we
can
continue
to
operate
without
violating
33
and
36
if
we
--
the
organizations
wanted
to
do
it.
they
are
still
bad
because
if
we
would
be
precluded
in
some
efforts,
but
if
they
are
all,
then
there
is
no
operation,
there
is
none.
and
with
an
organization
that
has
been
organizing
and
existing,
as
long
as
these
two
organizations
--
the
naacp
has
been
in
existence
since
1909
and
the
second
appellee
naacp
legal
defense
has
been
in
--
since
1940.
i
think
that
the
real
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
harm
is
yes
continuing.
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
the
district
court
to
hold
it,
pending
that
the
harm
will
come
up
again
bearing
in
mind
that
considerable
of
the
in
terrorem
effect
of
these
statutes
was
eased
with
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
once
that's
reestablished
then
we
have
that
same
problem
again
as
witnessed
to
the
fact
that
when
you
read
in
this
case
you
can't
help
but
being
moved
by
the
fact
that
just
one
after
the
other
the
plaintiffs
in
the
prince
edward
county
case
have
to
be
talked
about
legislative
committee
coming
and
testify
against
their
own
case.
this
--
this
atmosphere
down
in
virginia,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
it
and
i
think
that
the
real
argument
about
the
injury
would
be
on
that
basis.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
black
i
--
i'd
would
like
to
go
through
two
points,
one
the
record
shows
and
it
was
found
that
if
the
membership
list
is
disclosed
that
the
membership
would
drop
off,
i
mean
just
it's
not
possible
to
determine
how
far
it
would
drop
off.
well
a
membership
corporation
cannot
operate
without
members,
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned.
as
to
the
actual
helping
out
financially
with
the
litigation
the
trouble
there
is
that
although
possibly
money
could
be
raised,
for
example,
the
district
of
columbia
and
around,
to
helping
those
cases,
the
statute
prevents
you
from
giving
the
money.
it
not
only
prevents
you
from
raising
it,
it
prevents
you
from
paying
it
over.
and
as
to
the
lawyers,
the
statute
says
that
any
lawyer
that
doesn't
have
this
relationship
required
by
the
statute
is
violating
the
law,
so
that
there'd
be
no
question
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
statute
is
very
specific
on
that
i'd
rather
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
if
the
lawyer
is
--
gets
the
money
from
anybody
other
than
the
client
and
if
the
client
gets
the
money
from
anybody
but
somebody
close
to
him,
the
lawyer
is
a
party
to
this
barratry
and
it
includes
everybody
in
the
three
first
definitions
in
the
statute.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
criminal
penalties.
the
penalty
is
--
and
this
bond
with
the
lawyer
too,
i
have
the
penalties,
penalty
on
35
is,
a
$500
fine
or
a
year's
imprisonment
or
both
if
the
violator
is
a
person
and
subjects
the
corporation
to
$10,000
fine
and
revocation
of
authorization
to
carry
on
work
in
virginia.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
by
--
in
35,
there
is
no
escape,
in
31
and
32,
by
filing
on
membership
lists,
we
could
operate
rather
or
we
could
at
least
operate.
but
under
35
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
way
we
can
qualify,
so
stop
what
we
are
doing.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
--
it
was
my
understanding
in
this
particular
case
that
at
the
suggestion
of
judge
soper
the
appellants
did
agree
that
there
would
be
no
enforcement
of
any
of
those
statutes
until
this
case
was
finally
determined.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
it
was
all
five
them
were
in.
they
were
all
in
at
that
time.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
that
was
in
there
but
i
would
assume
that
that
was
the
only
--
the
real
problem
is
mr.
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
represent
all
of
the
enforcement
officers.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we're
in
trouble
if
--
we
now
have
the
third
attorney
general
since
this
case
started.
first,
we
had
attorney
general
almond,
then
we
had
attorney
general
patty,
and
now
we've
got
attorney
general
harrison.
now,
if
i
understand,
an
agreement
was
many
when
attorney
general
almond
was
there,
i
assume
that
the
others
were
on
it.
but
the
--
the
point
if
i
may
mention
it
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
members
would
be
afraid
to
join
even
now
for
fear
that
at
sometimes
the
statute
might
be
declared
constitutional
to
see
membership,
their
name
would
be
on
the
list
whenever
it
was
forced
to
be
turned
over.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know.
i
have
to
ask
the
virginia
lawyers.
well,
the
--
the
one
answer
that's
made
from
the
other
counsel
is
at
least
the
lawyers
will
have
no
assurance
of
what
would
have
happen
to
them
on
disbarment.
i
mean,
that
--
that
wouldn't
be
--
but
that
point
doesn't
worry
me.
i
think
this
mr.
justice
black
and
i
am
not
frankly
familiar
with
the
virginia
law,
but
in
most
instances
a
prosecutor
can
nol
pros
or
what
have
you
or
refuse
to
prosecute,
but
i
don't
believe
that
he
can
make
an
agreement
to
that
effect
that
would
be
binding.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
go
behind
the
motives
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
at
all.
i
assume
that
he
would
not
do
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
no
problem
once
that
is
done,
but
this
was
done
in
lieu
of
it.
and
if
i
may
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
other
point
when
i
was
talking
to
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
statutes
that
are
not
over
--
are
now
over
in
the
state
courts
do
not
require
disclosure
of
membership,
neither
one
of
them.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
two
cases.
may
it
please
the
court,
then
if
unless
there
are
questions,
it
appears
to
me
that
i
would
urge
respectfully
upon
this
court
the
affirmance
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
i
believe
that
it
is
particularly
timely
that
following
the
alabama
decision,
that
it
would
be
made
clear
that
the
federal
judiciary,
the
federal
courts,
are
to
be
freely
open
to
litigants.
and
that
that
is
the
problem
for
the
federal
courts
and
not
the
state
courts.
there
are
considerable
actions
pending
in
virginia.
no
one
knows
what
will
happen
to
those
court
cases.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
on
appeal
from
the
latest
ruling
of
judge
hutchinson
and
brief
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
brief
was
filed
by
the
(inaudible).
the
argument
on
april
the
14th,
it's
a
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
one.
that's
the
on,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
under
these
statutes
we
--
we
would
be
prevented
from
appearing
in
the
case,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
and
unless
that
--
unless
one
of
us
would
take
the
position
that
we
just
didn't
care
what
would
happen.
and
i
don't
think
that
anybody
should
be
required
to
do
that,
that
applies
to
all
these
cases
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
judge
soper
sets
them
all
out
because
he
is
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
he
knows
about
it,
he
sets
them
all
out
in
a
footnote.
i
think
that
this
is
not
the
case
that
the
state,
the
commonwealth
would
have
this
court
to
believe,
have
been
ordinary
regulatory
statute.
it's
not
a
case
of
a
justification
for
interference
with
the
lawful
rights
or
the
members
to
associate
with
each
other,
the
members
and
the
organizations
to
exercise
their
right
of
freedom
of
expression
that
the
state
has
deliberately
entered
into
that
field.
and
in
doing
so,
they
have
awfully
failed
to
show
the
justification
required
in
every
instance
by
this
court
of
showing
the
overwriting
necessity
to
do
it.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
at
least
in
my
mind
as
to
what
will
happen
in
virginia
if
these
statutes
are
by
this
court
either
declared
constitutional
or
sent
back
to
the
state
courts.
i
think
that
once
that's
done
in
the
posture
of
this
case.
and
when
i
mean
posture,
i
mean
the
legislative
history,
i
mean
the
record
in
this
case,
and
i
mean
the
argument
before
this
court
that
there
is
not
a
person
connected
with
either
of
these
organizations
who
wouldn't
be
worried
to
the
end
of
not
being
able
to
do
the
job
that
has
to
be
done,
and
for
that
reason
not
on
behalf
of
the
two
organizations,
but
on
behalf
of
the
people
in
virginia.
and
now
there
are
other
people
coming
forward
that
those
people
should
be
able
to
continue
what
is
always
since
there
has
been
law
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
find
in
our
research
the
right
of
people
to
pull
their
resources
for
charitable
work
in
helping
somebody
that's
being
mistreated
and
is
unable
to
get
his
legal
justice
in
a
courtroom.
i
think
virginia
instead
of
codifying
the
law
has
deliberately
flown
into
the
teeth
not
only
of
the
constitution,
not
only
of
the
common
law
rights
of
barratry,
but
seek
to
destroy
what
i
consider
to
be
as
important
as
any
duty
of
a
lawyer
and
that
is
the
duty
to
see
that
no
man
goes
undefended
whether
or
not
he
has
the
money.
and
virginia
has
struck
all
of
that
down
with
one
blow
including
five
statutes.
and
i
submit
virginia
cannot
be
permitted
to
continue
in
that
path.
