to

clause

justice
hugo
l.
black
section
2.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
explaining
what
you
meant
by
saying,
that
this
act
that
goes
by
it,
can
you
absolutely
preclude
any
operation
of
any
kind
by
your
organization
or
its
lawyers
in
virginia,
what
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
not
have
the
relationship,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
just
stating
if
you
can
briefly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
exactly
what
you
understand
this
statute
forbids?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
subject
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
statute
as
you
understand
it
how
can
the
organization
escape
that
consequence
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
go
far
enough
to
mean
that
if
the
statute
should
later
be
held
the
statute
should
later
be
held
constitutional,
what
had
been
done
prior
to
that
time
could
not
be
prosecuted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
they
waive
that
if
it's
a
valid
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
couldn't
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
speak
for
the
enforcement
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
they
point
out
--
then
was
in
connection
with
preserving
the
status
quo
along
the
lines
suggested.
does
any
attorney
general
or
interstate
officer
have
the
right
or
the
power
to
say
that
he
will
forgive
all
past
offenses
under
a
statute
which
is
held
constitutional,
which
is
under
attack
as
being
unconstitutional?
