what
was
the
basis
of
differentiation
by
the
lower
court
as
between
36
and
the
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
--
does
that
mean
that
for
--
if
the
district
court
to
have
construed
chapter
36
would
have
been
an
abstract,
practically
in
the
advice,
the
opinion
speaking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
rather
than
saying
whatever
the
statute
--
the
statute's
meaning
must
be
derived
from
the
particular
facts
of
a
case
or
adjudication
by
a
court
and
therefore
your
local
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
trying
to
elicit
is
whether
the
distinction
made
by
the
district
court
was
that
31
and
32
according
to
the
numbers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
ones
that
they
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
do
i
gather
the
court
thought
32
and
33
permit
or
invite
the
construction
on
the
face
of
a
statute
whereas
35
and
36
precludes
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
could
your
--
could
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
your
court
of
appeal
construe
31
and
32
in
such
a
way
within
its
power,
undoubted
power
from
my
point
of
view
of
its
power
of
construction,
that
was
not
the
basis
of
a
district
court's
decision
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
the
difference
of
opinion
as
to
validity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
meaning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
which
would
it
be
--
would
or
would
not
be
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
your
--
under
your
procedure,
to
elicit
a
state
construction,
does
one
have
to
go
through
the
whole
hierarchy
of
courts
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
court
of
appeal,
your
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
saying
that
under
your
severability
clause
or
either
specific
or
general
provisions,
all
the
others
maybe
a
--
offensive
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
maybe
invalid,
but
that
the
final
clause
can
be
sustained
and
if
severed
is
not
an
integral
part
of
an
organic
role
can
stand
--
rather,
it'd
be
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
people
understand
your
argument.
is
it
that
if
this
statute
with
its
four
or
five
provisions,
its
disjunctive
provision
came
before
the
supreme
court
of
appeal
of
virginia,
that
court
may
say
we
have
to
find
all
appeal
for
first
clauses
invalid,
but
we
construe
the
last
clause
to
mean,
as
though
there
had
been
a
separate
statute
saying
anybody
whose
activities
are
purposefully
designed
to
beget
physical
conflict
and
so
construe
you
say,
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
have
sustained
it.
and
you
further
argued
this
court
would
be
called
upon
to
sustain
it.
and
since
we
do
not
know
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
may
or
would
give
such
a
construction,
it
should
be
allowed
to
do
so,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
with
that,
but
may
i
put
the
matter
differently?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
to
determine
whether
virginia
or
any
other
state
court,
i'm
sure
you
would
be
the
last
to
say
that
there's
any
difference
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
right
to
legislate
constitutionally
may
be
determined
by
the
scope,
the
intended
scope
of
legislation.
you're
familiar
with
the
case
of
yick
wo
against
--
what
is
it,
yick
wo
against
california
--
if
--
hopkins,
if
--
if
legislation
though
apparently
covering
all
that
the
base
of
a
statute
makes
it
cover
is
in
fact
either
as
a
matter
of
enforcement
or
by
other
proof
directed
against
some
singled
out
individual
or
class,
that
may
make
a
difference,
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
was
that
you
cannot
--
that
this
court
cannot
define
a
discriminatory
purpose
qualifying
a
generally
appearing
statute
by
the
expressed
design
indicated
by
the
legislative
and
executive
authority
of
a
state
as
to
what
the
legislation
is
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
what
you
said
to
justice
harlan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
give
an
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
you
agree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
you
agree
that
they
couldn't
shut
out
--
that
although
they
tried
to
shut
out
russian
automobiles,
they
couldn't
shut
out
german
volkswagen
who
were
subject
to
the
same
infirmity.
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
couldn't
single
out
russians
cars
from
the
german
cars
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
argument
is
we
don't
know
the
merits
of
--
we
can't
tell
the
merits
until
the
state
court
decides
what
the
statutes
mean,
that's
the
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
profess
to
you
mr.
marshall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
invalidated
legislation,
has
itself
invalidated
legislation
designed
towards
carrying
of
our
position
manifested
by
its
political
leaders
of
the
(inaudible)
segregation.
have
you
taken
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judicial
notice
of
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
i
assumed
that
if
this
were
referred
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
it
wouldn't
invalid
legislation
that
ought
to
be
invalidated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
--
if
the
meaning
of
legislation
is
referred
--
if
the
other
--
31
and
32
are
referred
as
33
and
36
were
for
construction,
unless
you
say
there
is
nothing
to
mr.
gravatt's
argument,
that
the
last
clause
of
31
maybe
give
him
a
construction
that
can
withstand
the
constitution
of
the
act,
and
as
of
the
sheer
brutality,
to
refer
to
the
state
courts
for
construction,
which
no
construction
can
save.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
do
you
say
to
this
last
clause
of
31?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
court
has
again
and
again
construed
legislation
that
appeared
vague
and
saved
it
by
giving
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
this
court
can
decide
whether
it's
susceptible
of
a
meaning
no
matter
how
(inaudible)
was
construed.
the
state
court
can
say
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
take
that
position
and
it's
unimaginable
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
the
supreme
court
of
appeal
of
virginia
can
cut
the
last
clause
31
down
to
the
proportions
or
to
the
meaning
mr.
gravatt
has
given
us,
namely
that
it
should
apply
only
to
cases
of
designed
inducing
of
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
answer.
do
you
say
that
the
words
aren't
--
by
any
fair
intendment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
for
state
authority,
susceptible
of
any
such
limitation,
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
have
to
take
the
--
i
don't
have
to
take
an
accepted
position
by
counsel,
in
order
to
deny
myself
the
right
of
taking
a
reasonable
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
marshall,
the
statute
maybe
invalid
because
it
singled
out
a
specific
individual
unit
or
a
class,
the
singling
out
of
which
would
constitute
an
unfair
discrimination
under
the
protection
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
the
statute
maybe
invalid
or
it
applies
to
everybody,
it
couldn't
apply
to
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
it
applies
to
your
contention
that
it
applies
to
those
two
appellees
discriminatorily
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
it
might
also
apply
to
others.
now,
would
you
contend
that
if
it
weren't
discriminatory,
it
would
be
valid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
like
to
say
for
myself,
that
nothing
seems
to
me
more
treacherous
for
purposes
of
constitutional
adjudication
and
to
have
evidence
as
to
what
the
purpose
and
meaning
and
motive
of
a
statute
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
have
evidence
in
order
to
establish
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
establish
discrimination,
but
the
general
tendency
of
putting
on
witnesses
to
find
out
what
the
purpose
of
congress
was
or
the
purpose
of
the
general
assembly
seems
to
mean,
it's
not
indicated,
most
hazardous
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
side
has
--
to
finish
your
case,
you
ought
not
to
be
so
charitable
as
to
eject
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
misunderstand
mr.
gravatt
to
say
that
all
action
under
all
statute
would
be
stayed
until
the
supreme
court
of
appeal
would
pass
on
that,
did
i
misunderstand
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
that
isn't
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
state
of
the
prince
edward
litigation
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
if
this
were
referred
to
the
virginia
court,
you
and
your
associates
couldn't
participate
in
that
argument
or
by
brief?
