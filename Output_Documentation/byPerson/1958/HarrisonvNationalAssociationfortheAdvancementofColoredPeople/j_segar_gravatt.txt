mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
honors,
please.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
statutory
court
sitting
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
by
virtue
of
title
28
u.s.
c
1253.
the
controversy,
here,
arises
from
a
bill
filed
in
an
equity
proceeding
by
the
national
association
for
colored
people
and
--and
associate
organization,
the
national
association
for
colored
people
legal
defense
fund,
in
which
they
asked
the
lower
court
to
declare
five
virginia
statutes
unconstitutional
upon
the
ground
that
they
violated
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
and
rights
of
the
complainants
under
the
fourteenth
and
first
amendment.
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
among
the
grounds
stated
is
that
one
of
the
principal
contentions
which
we
wish
to
make
here,
namely,
that
the
court
should
have
withheld
its
extension
of
equity
jurisdiction
and
should
have
remanded
the
case
or
held
the
case
upon
its
doctrine
pending
a
state
construction
of
these
actions.
the
matter
was
--
the
motion,
of
course,
overruled
by
the
lower
court,
answers
were
filed
and
evidence
was
heard.
the
majority
opinion
written
by
two
justices,
judge
soper
and
district
judge
hoffman
over
--
held
three
of
the
statutes,
chapter
31,
32
and
35
to
be
plainly
in
violation
of
the
constitution
to
be
without
any
ambiguity
and
referred
or
retained
the
case
upon
the
doctrine,
and
directed
the
plaintiffs
to
apply
to
the
state
court
for
a
construction
of
the
remaining
two
statutes
33
and
36.
the
statutes
briefly,
these
three
statutes
that
we
have
here
under
consideration
fall
into
two
classes,
chapter
31
and
chapter
32,
what
you
would
commonly
characterize
as
registration
statutes
in
that,
they
require
the
registry
of
the
name
of
the
corporation
in
this
case
and
the
supplying
of
certain
information
there
with
--
with
the
state
--
the
clerk
of
the
state
corporation
commission
provided
the
corporation
or
association
is
engaged
in
certain
activities
defined
in
the
statute.
the
other
statute,
which
is
section
--
chapter
35
of
the
1956
act
that
were
exercised
in
the
general
assembly
is
a
statute
which
deals
with
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
it
is
quite
closely
akin
to
the
other
two
statutes
which
the
court
directed
be
referred
to
the
state
courts
for
a
construction.
we
shall
argue
here,
if
the
court,
please,
two
questions.
they
are
somewhat
related
to
each
other.
the
first
suggestion,
the
first
question
is,
should
the
lower
court
have
exercised,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
retained
these
--
this
case
upon
its
doctrine
with
a
suggestion
to
the
plaintiffs
that
they
apply
to
state
court
for
a
construction
of
these
statutes.
i
do
not
suppose
that,
in
fact,
the
appellees
in
their
brief
recognized
the
validity
of
that
principle.
they
have
undertaken
to
develop
an
exception
to
it
on
the
basis
that
that
can
--
will
only
be
done,
that
a
federal
equity
court
will
only
submit
a
statute
and
withhold
its
exercise
of
its
equity
jurisdiction,
will
only
do
so
when
it
is
apparent
to
the
federal
court
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
upon
which
the
statute
in
question
could
be
construed
or
interpreted
in
a
manner
which
would
make
it
constitutional.
the
problem
which
we
present
is
a
problem
which
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
and
by
judges
and
statesmen
through
the
years
as
being
a
delicate
and
an
extremely
serious
function
and
an
extremely
serious
matter.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
is
concerned
with
one
of
the
most
delicate
areas
in
which
federal
courts
are
required
to
discharge
their
duties,
namely,
though
that
area
in
which
they
come
in
conflict
with
state
powers
and
state
courts.
i
do
not
suppose
that
anyone
would
question
the
fact
that
the
power
to
define
crime,
to
define
what
acts
are
punishable
acts
is
a
power
reserved
to
the
states
under
the
ninth
and
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
of
course,
that
power
has
to
be
exercised,
subject
always
to
the
limitations
imposed
upon
the
states
in
the
federal
constitution
including
the
fourteenth
amendment
limitations
which
are
contended
for
here.
i
do
not
suppose
that
anyone
will
question
that
the
final
authority
for
the
interpretation
and
the
construction
of
state
statutes
on
our
system
of
government
lies
in
the
state
courts
and
appropriately
should
be
exercised
then.
i
further
do
not
suppose
that
anyone
would
question
the
fact
that
once
such
a
statute
is
construed
by
the
state
courts,
once
the
state
court
has
determined
the
scope,
has
determined
the
meaning
of
its
language,
the
area
within
its
--
which
it
operates,
the
class,
or
those
persons
to
whom
it
will
apply
that
this
court,
then
is
the
final
--
has
the
final
responsibility
to
determine
whether,
as
thus
interpreted,
or
interpreted,
the
statute
is
in
conflict
with
those
limitations
opposed
--
imposed
upon
the
states
in
our
constitution.
those
principles
and
the
doctrine
that
has
been
characterized
in
some
of
the
decisions
and
which
it
seems
to
me
very
aptly
described
as
a
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention
from
the
assumption
of
power
and
of
jurisdiction
which
a
federal
court
has,
that
doctrine,
if
you
please,
is
predicated
upon
those
principles
which
i
have
mentioned
to
you,
which
on
their
origin
in
the
very
structure
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it
is
--
it
is
a
doctrine
that
is
exercised
in
deference
to
the
division
of
congress
ordained
in
the
constitution.
there
is
another,
however.
there
is
another
great
and
compelling
reason
that
supports
and
directs
the
discretion
of
a
chance
this
court
in
withholding
its
jurisdiction
and
that
is
that
this
court,
the
function
and
the
responsibility,
as
i
apologize
for
suggesting,
is
a
heavy
and
a
great
and
an
enduring
responsibility.
what
is
done
here
in
the
construction
of
our
federal
constitution
reaches
on
down
the
ages
whenever
and
wherever
it
may
be
appropriate
for
it
to
be
considered.
for
that
reason,
this
court
has
always,
it
has
always
been
a
maxim
or
canon
of
the
exercise
of
its
power
that
it
would
avoid
deciding
a
case
upon
a
constitutional
issue
if
the
case
could
be
properly
disposed
of
upon
another
brand.
all
of
those
considerations
are
not
-
if
your
honors
please
simply
considerations
of
form.
they
are
considerations
that
reach
to
the
very
substance
of
our
system
of
government.
they
are
considerations
that
are
of
the
most
compelling
nature
when
we
come
to
consider
the
friction
that
may
be
generated
by
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
federal
power
in
an
area
that
primarily
is
the
responsibility
for
the
states
to
operate
in.
and
i
am
confident
that
a
court
of
equity
and
that
this
court
will
always
recognize
that
a
chance
here
sitting
with
such
great
power
to
be
exercised
upon
a
state
legislature
and
upon
all
its
people
will
use
that
forbearance
in
applying
it
that
is
dictated
by
the
considerations
and
the
constitutional
principles
which
i
have
very
briefly
referred
to.
this
doctrine
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
it
applies
as
far
as
i
know,
sir
to
--
to
--
there
are
a
great
line
of
cases
in
which
the
court
has
applied
it
in
a
great
many
different
situations.
i
think
it
applies
to
this
principle
here
and
i
think
it
applies
in
all
areas.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
they
--
they
are
--
are
provisioned
with
respect
to
legal
aid
society
of
the
bar
association,
yes,
sir.
they
are
general
provisions
that
apply
to
everybody
that
falls
within
them.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
do
not
think
it's
necessary
to
refer
further
to
the
principles
supporting
the
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention
contended
for
by
the
appellants
here.
on
yesterday
afternoon
when
we
can
--
when
the
court
adjourned,
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
me
a
question
which
i
confess
i
did
not
understand
sir,
but
i
gather
that
it
indicated
a
desire
that
we
go
into
a
discussion
of
the
statutes
involving
themselves
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
there
are
three
statutes
and
with
your
consent
sir,
i
will
--
would
like
to
discuss
all
three
of
them
with
that
in
view
and
with
the
other
aspects
of
the
statutes
in
mind.
the
first
statute
here
is
referred
to
the
in
the
record
as
chapter
31
of
the
extra
session
1956.
its
principle
provision
is
as
follows,
no
person
shall
engage
in
the
solicitation
of
funds
from
the
public
or
any
segment
thereof
when
such
funds
will
be
used
in
whole
or
in
part
to
commence
or
to
prosecute
further
any
original
proceeding
unless
such
person
is
a
party
or
unless
he
has
pecuniary
right
or
liability
in
--
therein.
or
shall
any
person
extend
on
this
from
whatever
source
received
to
commence
or
to
prosecute
further
any
original
proceeding
unless
such
person
is
a
party
or
has
a
pecuniary
right
or
liability
therein
until
any
person
shall
first,
and
then
this
--
the
second
section
begins
which
requires
the
information.
the
information
required
of
a
corporation
and
this
is
substantially
the
same
information
that
is
required
of
the
second
registration
statute
which
i
have
mentioned,
which
is
chapter
32.
certified

of

or

not
on

of

of
the
names
and

of

(c)

showing

of

or

if
required
by
the
state
corporation
commission,
the
name
and
address
of
each
and
every
person
or
corporation
or
association
making
any
donation
or
contribution.
a
certified
statement
showing
in
detail
by
each
transaction,
the
expanded
interest
of
such
partnership,
corporation,
or
association
on
the
preceding

objects

which
made
it
and
have
the
information
routed
thereto,
required
by
a
state
corporation
commission.
and
a
certified
statement
showing
the
location
of
each
office
or
branch
of
such
partnership,
association,
corporation
or
association
in
the
counties
and
cities
in
which
it
proposes
to
or
does
finance
or
maintain
litigation
to
which
it
is
not
a
party.
the
statute,
if
the
court
please,
undertakes
to
regulate
two
things,
one
is
the
solicitation
and
expenditure
of
funds
from
the
public
for
the
purpose
defined.
the
purpose
defined
is
the
use
of
solicitation
of
money
to
prosecute
and
maintain
litigation
in
which
the
party
or
the
corporation
has
no
personal
interest,
no
direct
personal
pecuniary
liability
or
interest.
so
that
there
are
two
propositions
involved
in
a
consideration
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
the
first
place,
i
believe
that
this
court
will
recognize
the
fact
that
in
a
number
of
cases
that
have
--
has
--
have
come
before
the
court
where
there
have
been
raised
a
question
of
registration
and
those
statutes
have
been
construed
to
apply
the
limit
freedom
of
speech,
i
refer
particularly
to
thomas
against
collins,
cantwell
against
connecticut
is
another
of
those
cases.
in
each
of
those
opinions
and
in
the
case
of
murdock
against
pennsylvania,
this
court
has
indicated
rather
clearly
that
it
did
not
undertake
to
pass
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
solicitation
of
funds
from
the
public.
so
that
you
have
here
a
question
that
so
far
as
i
know
this
court
has
not
as
yet
passed
upon
and
the
indication
from
the
opinions
that
i
have
mentioned
to
you
are
--
that
the
court
has
indicated
that
there
is
certainly
an
area
in
which
that
regulation
is
justified.
now,
the
second
thing
that
is
dealt
with
in
the
statute
is
the
use
--
that
the
money
as
they
put
to,
that
is,
that
it
is
money
that's
been
solicited
to
finance
litigation
in
the
courts.
there
are
many
reasons
why
that
aspect
of
this
statute
should
require
a
consideration
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
virginia
before
it
comes
here
for
this
court
to
pass
upon.
in
the
first
place,
the
lower
court
has
already
referred
two
of
these
statutes
to
the
state
court
namely
chapters
33
and
36.
chapter
36
deals
directly
in
particular
with
this
aspect
of
the
statute
namely
the
proper
construction
of
a
provision
in
the
statutes
that
runs
through
several
of
them,
prohibiting
the
expenditure
of
money
to
finance
litigation
to
which
a
person
is
not
a
party.
so
that
if
the
court
were
to
--
the
lower
court,
if
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
this
court
takes
jurisdiction
of
this
matter
upon
its
merit,
to
pass
on
the
constitutional
issues,
you
may
immediately
be
confronted
with
a
construction
in
the
state
court
of
a
companion
statute
that
must
be
construed,
entire
materials
with
these
provisions
which
would
be
a
construction
that
would
relieve
the
court
of
the
responsibility
of
meeting
the
constitutional
issue,
or
that
if
i
put
a
constitutional
interpretation
upon
the
statute
which
would
be
different
from
the
interpretation
which
had
been
applied
to
it
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
it
was
--
that
was
--
very
brief
in
his
opinion,
if
your
honor
please,
and
he
just
--
he
criticized
the
statute
but
say
for
--
in
chapter
6
--
36,
and
i
am
reading
from
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court,
the
majority
opinion
at
page
119
of
the
record.
in
chapter
36
a
significant
language
to
be
construed
relates
to
inducing
one
to
act
in
the
giving
of
advice
by
one
whose
professional
advice
has
not
been
sought
in
accordance
with
the
canons
of
legal
ethics.
but
he
referred
the
entire
statute.
it
clearly
appears
that
language
employed
must
be
construed
as
applied
to
the
facts
involved
upon
such
construction
will
depend
the
decision
of
whether
the
statutes
applied
to
the
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
members
of
the
bar
employed
by
them.
that
is
what
the
court
said
as
to
chapter
36.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
rather
than
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
two
statutes
that
were
sent
back
are
statutes
which
deal
in
addition
to
this
question
of
soliciting
money
or
spending
money
to
maintain
litigation
that
a
man
is
--
the
person
is
not
a
party
to.
those
two
statutes
also
dealt
with
improper
solicitation
of
law
business.
and
chapter
36,
which
i
have
here
in
my
hand
and
i
would
glad
if
your
honor
would
leave
copies
of
this
section,
i
find
that
chapter
36
is
not
in
this
record.
the
other
statute
is
in
the
record
and
i
think
it's
quite
material
that
the
court
should
have
chapter
36
before
it
and
if
you
permit
me
i'll
hand
these
copies
to
the
clerk
or
to
the
court
at
this
moment.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
all
right,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
35
and
--
33
and
36
are
the
ones
that
they
referred
back.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
ones
that
they
didn't
are
32
and
33.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
court
said
--
i
think
not
31
and
32,
as
best
i
can
gather
from
the
lower
court's
opinion,
upon
the
basis
that
it
required
the
disclosure
of
information
that
in
the
registration
that
the
court
construed
the
statute
to
require
the
disclosure
of
the
rank
and
file
members
of
this
organization.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
and
i
think
that's
a
question
that
here
--
in
his
opinion
he
indicates
that
he
knocked
the
statute
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
if
i
am
correct
in
my
understanding
of
the
district
court's
decision
i
think
unquestionably
that
it
can
as
to
the
statute
that
we
are
now
discussing
and
i
will
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
as
to
construction
--
yes.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
understand
your
question
perfectly,
i
hope
so.
now,
in
--
you
can
move
to
section
1,
subparagraph
1
of
section
2
of
chapter
31,
which
is
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
if
you
wish
to
refer
to
it.
and
here
are
the
parts
that
the
court
knocked
out,
a
certified
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
officers,
directors,
stockholders,
members,
agents,
and
employees
or
other
persons
acting
for
or
in
behalf
of
such
partnership.
i
submit
to
the
court,
now
let
me
--
let
me
read
this
other
part
of
the
statute,
section
5,
there
is
no
punishment
for
an
individual
whose
name
is
not
filed.
that
is
a
penalty
on
the
corporation
for
not
supplying
the
information,
here
in
section
5,
any
individual
acting
as
an
agent
or
employee
of
any
partnership,
corporation
or
association
in
any
activity
in
violation
of
this
act
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
and
maybe
punished
as
provided
by
law.
so
that
the
penal
provisions
of
the
statute
do
not
reach
anybody
except
the
agent
of
the
other
corporation.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
will
read
section
1,
the
language
which
i
have
just
read
to
you,
where
it
says
members,
it
does
not
at
that
part
qualify
a
member
as
being
a
member
agent,
but
the
statute
is
dealing
with
soliciting.
the
statute
is
dealing
with
expanding
of
funds,
and
when
it
follows
the
words
stockholders,
members,
agents,
and
employees,
all
other
persons
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
such
partnership,
corporation
or
association,
if
the
court
is
required
to
give
a
statute
a
constitutional
construction
rather
than
an
unconstitutional
construction,
i
most
respectfully
submit
to
your
honor
that
it
conforms
to
the
purpose
of
this
law,
and
it
conforms
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
to
interpret
it,
so
as
to
require
registration
of
those
members
who
act,
as
those
members
and
others
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
such
partnership.
that's
what
this
thing
--
what
this
law
is
designed
to
do,
that
it's
wide
open
to
a
construction
by
any
reasonable
application
of
this
language.
and
in
the
light
of
--
of
this
court's
opinion
in
naacp
against
alabama
which
has
been
decided
since
this
statute
was
written,
i
think
that
certainly
the
--
the
state
court,
that
would
be
strong
and
persuasive
reason
taken
with
the
basic
purpose
of
this
statute
for
the
state
court
to
construe
it,
to
apply
only
to
those
persons
who
represent
the
corporation
in
soliciting
firms
as
provided
in
the
statute
for
the
public.
in
any
event,
i
most
respectfully
submit
to
--
to
the
court
that
there
are
grave
questions
of
interpretation
and
constitutional
construction
in
the
statute
--
construction
of
the
statute
that
bear
directly
upon
the
question
of
its
constitutionality.
and
in
the
recent
case
of
government
employees
against
windsor,
this
court
laid
down
the
proposition
that
the
state's
construction
of
the
statute
had
to
be
a
state
construction
in
the
light
and
testing
of
the
constitutional
freedoms
which
are
here
urged
against
these
statutes.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir,
they
have.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
they
have
--
they
have
been
tried
in
the
lower
court
and
an
opinion
has
been
rendered
and
in
that
opinion
the
statutes
were
held
not
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
--
i
was
not
in
that
case
and
i
do
not
know
if
the
opinion
has
not
been
published,
but
i
understand
that
those
two
sections
have
been
held
by
the
circuit
court
in
the
city
of
richmond
i
think
to
meet
the
requirements
of
constitutionality,
i
assume
that
they
would
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
so
that
the
court
is
confronted
in
this
same
proposition,
runs
through
every
one
of
these
statutes,
not
only
--
i
say,
the
same
proposition,
this
proposition
runs
through
every
one
of
them.
it
shall
be
unlawful,
i
read
now
from
36,
which
is
in
the
state
court,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
not
having
a
direct
interest
in
the
proceedings
either
before
or
after
the
proceedings
commences,
to
promise
gift,
offer,
conspire
or
agree
or
so
forth,
any
money,
bank
loan
and
so
forth,
personal
services
or
great
many
different
things
described
there,
or
any
other
assistance
as
an
inducement
to
any
person
to
commence.
so
that
you
got
in
section
36
the
question
of
--
that's
involved
here
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
association
has
a
right
to
spend
money
in
promoting
litigation
in
which
they
do
not
have
an
interest.
and
it
raises
--
that
is
one
of
the
principle
questions
that's
raised
here
on
this
appeal
and
it's
a
question
that
is
before
the
state
court
at
the
present
time
that
they
must
determine.
now,
if
there's
any
question
that
any
--
that
is
found
by
the
court
would
like
to
ask
me
about
that
section
i
will
be
glad
to
undertake
to
supply
the
matter
of
listing
the
names
of
persons
who
contribute.
we
recognize
as
a
serious
matter,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
be
required
to
disclose
who
has
made
the
contribution.
but
if
the
statute
is
--
it's
a
question
of
how
far
the
state
can
go
in
undertaking
to
protect
the
public
from
fraud,
and
to
what
extent
and
what
effect
that
this
thing
has
upon
these
people
and
i
submit
to
the
--
that
we
need
a
state
construction
and
that
the
state
court
ought
to
be
required
to
meet
those
issues
before
they
come
in,
because
if
--
this
has
been
pointed
out
in
several
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinions
on
this
subject.
and
it
is
a
situation
that
existed
before
the
court
applied
this
to
clarify
this
principle.
there
were
in
several
cases
that
--
i
have
a
citation
to
here,
the
court
was
(inaudible)
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
state
statutes
and
granting
permission
to
come
back
to
the
court
after
the
state
had
--
after
there
was
a
state
construction
so
that
you
were
construing
state
statutes
and
interpreting
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
on
a
tentative
basis
as
to
what
the
result
might
be
in
litigation
in
the
state
courts.
and
this
question
of
contribution
is
such
a
question.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
i
think
through
the
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
you
cannot
--
i
do
not
think
that
this
--
there
are
situations
where
you
can
get
the
record
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
do
that
in
this
instance.
i
think
that
the
statute
provides
a
proceeding
attacking
a
state
statute.
it's
to
be
brought
in,
i
believe
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
or
one
of
the
richmond
courts
anyhow
and
the
appeal
goes
from
there,
it
is
--
we
of
course
have
in
virginia,
the
trial
court
judgment
procedure
which
authorizes,
expressly
authorizes
their
application
to
the
court
under
proper
circumstances
for
the
construction
of
state
statutes
and
that
is
the
proceeding
that
has
been
invoked
here
by
these
--
by
our
opponents
for
the
construction
of
these
state
statutes.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
none
whatever,
none
whatever.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
sir,
that
--
we
have
never
undertaken
to
enforce
the
statute
in
anyway.
when
we
came
into
the
three
judge
court,
we
suggested
to
the
court
and
agreed
with
our
opponents
that
we
would
not
undertake
to
enforce
these
statutes
upon
them
until
this
matter
was
finally
determined.
i
understand
from
counsel
that
the
same
arrangement
is
in
existence
now
with
counsel
pending
the
procedure
in
the
state
court.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
you
also
have
a
retention
upon
the
doctrine,
a
provision
in
--
that
has
been
used,
and
i
think
it's
a
wholesome
and
a
proper
one,
that
the
federal
court
should
retain
this
matter,
in
event
there
might
be
somebody
in
virginia
that
perhaps
the
attorney
general
could
not
control.
the
federal
court
is
wide
open
for
an
injunction
to
restrain
any
such
prosecution
but
i
have
no
idea
at
all
that
it
--
that
such
a
thing
would
take
place.
so
that
there
would
be
no
risk
as
i
see
it
to
these
interests
to
proceed
in
an
orderly
and
normal
fashion
that
would
certainly
bring
about
a
final
solution
of
this
problem
that
would
be
much
more
in
conformity
with
the
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
they
were
commenced
after
the
judge
rendered
his
decision
in
which
he
split
these
statutes.
he
declared
three
of
these
statutes
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
he
said
two
of
them
need
local
construction
and
those
two
he
would
--
as
to
those
two,
he
retained
the
matter
on
the
docket
of
the
court,
with
the
right
reserved
to
the
complainants
to
apply
to
the
court
for
further
relief
pending
a
state
construction
of
the
statute,
a
very
anomalous,
i
think
if
you
pardon
me,
i
don't
--
it's
a
rather
anomalous
kind
of
an
order.
i
think
that
if
he
was
going
to
take
that
position
that
it
certainly
should've
--
would've
been
much
more
desirable
he
had
said
all
of
it
goes.
his
opinion
was
based
upon
the
idea
that
this
was
a
kind
of
a
plan
and
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
virginia
to
deny
--
directly
direct
that
to
naacp
and
yet
these
other
two
statutes
are
tainted
with
exactly
the
same
kind
of
deleterious
or
purpose
if
that
is
--
it
is
what
it
is
and
he
sent
them
back
for
interpretation
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
they
were,
yes,
sir.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
next
statute
that
we
have
to
deal
with
is
a
registration
statute
also
and
it
requires
substantially,
the
same
information
that
is
required
in
the
31,
as
chapter
32.
it
describes
--
it
starts
out
with
a
preempt
which
states
a
policy
of
the
state
to
preserve
the
peaceful
relations
among
races
in
the
midst
of
these
distressing
problems
that
we
are
having
to
cope
with.
i
might
call
your
attention,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
have
had
had
no
trouble
in
virginia.
we
have
had
law
suits
and
we've
litigated
and
i
regret
that
our
people
have
not
been
pleased
or
have
been.
but
we
have
had
no
violence.
we
have
had
nobody
--
no
riots.
and
--
and
these
--
this
section
is
designed
to
try
to
keep
the
name
of
virginia,
which
most
virginians
love
un-smudged,
by
that
kind
of
a
contest
about
this
matter.
and
i
think
that
the
requirements
that
are
setup
in
the
statute
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
that
purpose,
expressed
purpose
of
the
legislature.
there
are
three
--
four
things
required
in
order
to
require
a
registration
under
this
statute.
one,
at
first
a
corporation
engages
as
one
of
its
principal
functions
of
the
activities
in
promoting
or
closing
in
any
matter
to
pass
the
legislation.
two,
who
or
which
has
as
one
of
its
principal
functions
or
activity
the
advocating
of
racial
integration
or
segregation.
three,
whose
activities
cause
or
tend
to
cause
racial
conflicts
or
violence.
now,
very
hardly,
the
first
one
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
is
susceptible
of
a
state
construction
as
to
who
or
what
constitutes
principal
function
or
activity,
it's
a
lobbying
statute,
it
had
to
do
with
lobbying
in
the
legislature.
and
the
case
of
united
states
against
harris
is
pertinent
to
a
discussion
and
a
decision
of
that
question
by
the
lower
court.
the
other
--
who
or
which
has
one
of
its
principle
functions
or
activities
advocating
a
racial
integration
or
segregation,
or
whose
activities
cause
or
tend
to
cause
racial
conflicts
or
violence.
judge
soper
throughout
that
last
phrase,
whose
activities
--
whose
activities
cause
or
tend
to
cause
racial
conflicts
or
violence
has
been
an
unconstitutional
restrain.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
in
the
case
beauharnais
against
illinois,
a
similar
language
was
construed
by
this
court
to
mean
conduct
tending
to
a
breach
of
the
peace.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
nothing
else,
if
all
of
it
in
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
that
provision
of
it
is
severable.
and
anybody
in
virginia
who
goes
out
at
this
time
to
advocate
racial
segregation
or
racial
integration
under
such
circumstances
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
bring
about
and
to
show
an
intention
to
bring
about
a
breach
of
the
public
peace
is
a
person
that
virginia
ought
to
have
the
power
and
the
opportunity
to
control.
and
if
you
stick
to
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
upon
this
issue,
you
have
now
on
the
constitution
a
provision
and
a
statute
that
under
a
state
construction
in
my
opinion
would
be
a
severable
provision
of
the
statute
that
would
take
from
the
hand
of
the
state
the
only
remaining
weapon
that
they
have
to
protect
and
to
control
the
people
in
this
hour
when
we
need
so
much
to
have
that
done.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
sir?
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
am
referring
to
clause
number
3,
whose
activities
cause
or
--
cause
or
tend
to
cause
racial
conflicts
or
violence,
it's
on
appendix
--
page
5,
section
2.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
about
the
--
1,
2,
3
--
it's
on
down
about
the
seventh
or
eighth
line
of
that
paragraph,
there
are
four
things
required
in
that
statute.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
that
thing
is
so
important,
judge,
and
i
know
i
haven't
much
time
and
i
wanted
to
plant
that
with
the
court.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
i
did
--
did
refer
to
it
and
i
think
that
in
that
decision
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
there
was
language
used
--
the
judge
threw
that
out
--
the
lower
court
threw
that
language
out
as
being
too
vague.
being
unconstitutional
in
the
sense,
it
was
too
vague.
it
didn't
give
a
person
notice
of
what
they
--
the
offence
might
be.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
statute
sir,
used
as
a
language
who
or
which
is
engaged
or
--
wait
a
minute,
whose
activities
cause
or
tend
to
cause
racial
conflicts
or
violence.
the
preamble
of
the
statute,
that
language
it
seems
to
me
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
express
purpose
of
the
statute
to
preserve
the
public
peace.
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
can
say
that
this
statute
does
not
mean
that
all
advocacy
of
racial
integration
or
segregation
is
unlawful
under
this
provision
of
the
law.
but
that
racial
integration,
they
advocate
their
racial
integration
or
segregation
so
as
to
and
under
circumstances
as
to
cause
racial
conflict
or
violence
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
do
you
understand?
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
--
i
am
not
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
so
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
but,
i
am
not
sure
that
that
is
not
something
that
perhaps
the
court
should
read
into
it
in
construing
a
criminal
statute,
there's
always
an
element
of
circumstances
and
intent
that
enters
into
it
i
think
unless
it
is
dispensed
there
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that
is
correct
sir.
we
had
gone
--
cast
it
in
virginia,
just
at
the
time
that
this
thing
was
done.
and
if
your
honors
will
refer
to
the
case
of
(inaudible)
against
britton,
you
will
find
out
the
reason
for
that
--
the
necessity
of
that
provision.
now,
the
other
things
that
ought
to
be
said,
i'm
afraid
about
these
statutes,
i
come
now
if
the
court
please
to
the
last
one
which
is
a
statute
that
is
known
as
a
barratry
statute.
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
instigation
or
stirring
up
of
litigation
and
it
also
deals
with
the
payment
of
extensive
litigation
by
people
that
are
not
a
party
and
do
not
have
an
interest
or
not
justified
by
a
relation
of
parent-child
or
trust
relation
or
in
some
other
way
related
to
the
litigation.
the
court
held
that
that
statute
was
an
improper
infringement.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
language
in
the
statute
must
be
construed
in
the
light
of
what
the
whole
thing
is
designed
to
deal
with
and
that
is
that
the
money
has
to
be
paid
to
support
the
litigation,
as
the
moving
cause
of
the
litigation,
that
but
for
the
payment
of
the
money,
by
the
person
who
stirs
up
the
litigation,
that
that
action
would
not
have
been
brought.
and
that
construction
the
court
rejected
and
simply
found
out
of
hand
that
with
the
very
best
of
intentions,
that
any
wrongful
purpose
at
all
to
stir
up
or
to
instigate
intermeddling
in
litigation,
that
this
statute
means
that
anybody
who
pays
out
money
is
simply
to
the
financing
litigation,
that
they
are
not
a
party
to
comes
in
to
the
hands
of
it.
it
may
be
so
construed,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
state
court
can
construe
this
statute
in
the
light
of
the
other
statutes
that
was
referred
to,
namely
section
33,
which
the
state
court
now
has
to
construe.
and
which
is
directly
directed
by
an
amendment
to
statute
with
respect
to
professional
ethics
in
virginia
that
fell
on
the
books
for
many,
many
years,
is
directed
at
improper
solicitation
of
business
and
the
improper
inducement
of
people
to
institute
and
to
carry
on
lawsuits.
i
believe
that
the
court
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
a
question
that
i
--
i
do
not
think
--
i
think
the
rights
of
virginia,
if
i
may
be
frank,
in
this
area
sir
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
maybe
we
--
in
this
area,
i
think
that
the
rights
of
virginia
to
legislate
on
these
subjects
are
constitutional
rights.
i
think
they
are
rights
that
are
reserved.
and
i
do
not
think
that
any
motive
or
any
purpose
by
the
governor,
by
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people,
however
it
might
be
expressed
can't
deny
it
to
the
state
of
virginia
the
right
to
legislate
in
areas
that
are
reserved
to
them
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
none
in
the
world,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
agree,
sir.
and
i
think
that
we
ought
to
be
convicted
after
the
case
is
in.
in
other
words,
i
think
if
this
statute
is
enforced
improperly,
if
it
isn't
enforced
against
(inaudible)
organizations
in
virginia,
then
doing
on
the
other
side
of
this
issue,
what
these
gentlemen
are
doing,
and
we'll
have
others.
if
there
is
any
impartiality
or
any
abuse
in
the
enforcement
of
it,
i
think
it's
a
question,
a
serious
question
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
sir,
the
language
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
--
i
mean
to
say
that
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
want
to
give
you
--
give
you
an
illustration
of
what
i
do
mean.
let's
assume
that
russia
is
making
motor
vehicles
that
are
outselling
american
vehicles,
but
they
won't
function
properly
if
you
drive
them
less
than
60
miles
an
hour.
and
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
said,
"we
don't
want
any
russian
automobiles
in
virginia.
we
won't
have
them.
our
speed
limit
has
been
too
high
anyhow,
we've
got
a
60
mile
speed
limit,
it's
been
too
high
anyhow.
now
let's
cut
the
speed
limit
down
to
45
so
we
can
get
those
things
out
here."
if
they
had
that
deliberate
purpose,
i
think
they
had
the
power
to
pass
that
statute
and
reduce
the
speed
limit.
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
russians
could
come
in
and
say,
"because
you
had
a
wrong
purpose,
you
put
the
speed
limit
down,
because
the
government
said
you
had
a
wrong
purpose
or
because
the
constitutional
convention
said
you
had
a
wrong
purpose.
we
don't
--
we
say
that
you
haven't
got
the
power
to
regulate
speed
limit
on
you
public
roads
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
--
even
though
it
may
also
have
relevancy
to
the
public
safety
and
other
aspects
of
it,
of
the
road."
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
well,
the
law
might
do
it.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
think
if
they
--
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
they
couldn't,
if
any,
if
it
were
granted
on
an
exercisable
power,
sir
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
all
of
that
fall
under
the
same
rule.
and
the
rule
had
to
be
applied
to
everybody.
but
if
its
effect
was
to
knock
the
russian
or
german
cars
out,
i
think
that
would
be
incidental.
now,
i
wish
to
say
just
this
other
one
thing
to
your
honors
about
this
matter
that
justice
harlan
asked
me
about.
though
some
of
the
language
may
not
appear,
and
some
of
the
expressions
may
not
appear
to
this
court,
as
being
becoming
expression,
this
has
been
a
trial
for
people
of
virginia,
and
in
those
--
in
the
interposition
rather,
and
in
every
address
that
the
government
had
made,
all
that
they
have
ever
declared
that
they
had
a
purpose
to
do
of
what
is
legal
and
honorable
and
constitutional,
that's
what
they
said
they
wanted
to
do.
and
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
negative
thing,
acting
negatively
upon
virginia
and
the
other
states,
prohibiting
them
from
doing
things,
if
virginia
can
find
a
lawful,
honorable,
constitutional
way
to
arrange
a
thing
that
all
of
the
people
of
virginia
conceded
they
want,
certainly
most
of
them,
then
what
would
be
wrong?
that
ought
not
to
condemn
legislation
here
in
this
court,
simply
because
it
is
to
--
made
incidental
of
meeting
a
purpose
that
lies
beyond
or
that
is
within
the
bounds
of
what
the
state
can
probably
do.
i
do
not
concede
that
these
statutes
have
any
such
purpose.
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
these
statutes
are
designed
to
cope
with
all
organizations
and
they
have
been
so
enforced
up
until
now.
and
what
the
future
holds
with
respect
to
those
matters,
i
submit
to
this
honorable
court
none
of
us
know.
and
we
shan't
--
should
not
tie
our
hands
or
tie
virginia's
hands,
so
far
as
the
future
maybe
concerned
in
the
light
or
developments
that
may
take
place
with
a
blanket
announcement
and
withdraw
a
power
to
legislate
in
this
area
which
may
become
so
terribly
vital.
i
thank
you
very
much.
