mr.
david
j.
mays
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
my
time
is
very
brief
and
i
will
make
my
points
as
rapid
as
i
can
and
then
maybe
a
bit
disjointed.
there
has
much
in
the
record
as
to
history
of
these
statutes
and
it
has
been
said
to
your
honor
as
it
was
said
in
the
lower
court
that
all
of
it
was
a
part
of
a
the
then
governor's
plan
to
defeat
the
opinion
of
this
court.
when
your
honors
have
an
opportunity,
if
you
will
look
at
page
470
of
the
record
you
will
find
that
mr.
harrison
mann
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates
from
arlington
county
was
the
patron,
the
chief
patron
of
all
five
of
these
bills
and
that
he
had
written
himself
chapters
32,
dealing
with
the
matter
of
filing
membership
list,
registration,
and
35
which
had
to
do
with
barratry
and
bought
them
--
brought
them
as
it
were
in
his
saddlebags
down
to
richmond.
they
were
no
part
of
the
plans
of
the
governor.
they
were
no
part
of
the
plans
of
any
commission.
it
was
done
at
the
instance
of
that
particular
member
of
the
general
assembly.
i
don't
know
that
that's
vital
at
all,
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
i
think
it
should
be
brought
to
your
attention.
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
matter
of
so-called
massive
resistance.
mr.
david
j.
mays
430.
mr.
david
j.
mays
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes.
down
a
little
bit
towards
the
end
of
the
page
on
430.
now,
this
registration
statute
doesn't
apply
just
to
the
naacp.
it
applies
to
any
organization
which
comes
within
the
purview
of
the
statute.
it
applies
to
white
organizations.
we
have
some
in
our
counties.
it
applies
to
any
statewide
white
organization
which
is
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
in
dealing
with
this
particular
problem.
they
are
bound
to
register
just
as
well
as
the
naacp
is.
so
there
is
no
distinction
made,
it's
done
as
a
matter
of
safety.
it's
done
as
a
matter
of
preventing
violence
and
everybody
is
in
the
same
boat
so
far
as
compliance
with
the
law
is
concerned.
in
the
barratry
statute
which
has
occasioned
considerable
comments
from
adverse
counsel,
it
is
stated
that
this
is
not
a
codification
of
common
law
and
one
of
the
particulars,
it
isn't.
barratry
was
a
common
law
that
frequents
stirring
up
of
litigation.
according
to
blackson
(ph),
that
was
true.
under
this
statute
one
offense
is
enough,
that
distinction
is
clearly
there.
it
is
true
also
that
this
particular
section
has
some
exception
which
are
not
in
blackson
(ph).
but
to
say
that
because
some
exceptions
appear
in
this
particular
chapter
35,
is
that
it
is
aimed
only
at
the
naacp
is
clearly
untrue
because
the
naacp
at
pages
29
and
30
of
its
brief
has
enumerated
many
types
of
association
which
act
in
concept,
i
will
not
take
time
to
read
them,
they
have
used
a
number
of
them
here
by
way
of
illustration,
and
none
of
them
are
excluded
as
exceptions
under
this
act.
so
it
cannot
be
fairly
said,
that
only
the
naacp
would
be
exempt
from
its
terms.
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes.
mr.
david
j.
mays
i
am
not
certain,
sir.
but
here,
there
has
to
be
a
stirring
up
of
litigation
and
a
supplying
of
money
too
in
order
to
make
this
statute
operative.
now,
one
thing
that
has
puzzled
us
very
greatly
in
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
we
have
great
respect
for
that
court,
but
your
honors
will
notice
on
page
93
of
the
record,
beginning
about
line
six.
the
court
there
says
that
chapter
33
and
36
are
vague
and
ambiguous,
and
we
do
not
pass
upon
that
constitutionality.
and
because
these
statutes
are
vague
and
ambiguous,
they
are
sent
on
to
the
state
court
for
determination.
and
yet
chapter
32
is
said
by
the
court
to
be
so
vague
and
indefinite,
that
it
can't
pass
the
test
of
constitutionality.
and,
i've
made
some
limitations
myself,
and
i'm
not
saying
this
out
of
sarcasm,
but
the
subtlety
is
too
great
for
me,
i
do
not
know
why.
if
two
statutes
are
vague
and
ambiguous,
they
go
to
the
state
court
for
interpretation,
but
if
they
are
vague
and
indefinite
they
can
be
declared
constitutional
out
of
hand.
and
of
course
if
the
major
argument
made
by
adverse
counsel,
that
is
that
all
of
these
statutes
are
tainted,
then
why
is
that
two
of
the
tainted
statutes
go
to
the
state
court
for
interpretation
and
three
of
that
are
tainted
are
declared
unconstitutional
out
of
hand?
those
are
the
distinctions
we
have
not
been
able
to
make.
mr.
marshall
has
stated
to
the
court
that
the
lawyers
themselves
on
considerable
fear
here,
there
is
no
reason
there
should
be,
certainly
their
activities
have
not
indicated
any
such
fear,
they
continue
with
all
of
the
cases.
they
are
receiving
fees.
things
are
going
on
as
far
as
i
can
see,
as
have
been
going
on
before.
and
i
think
that
well
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice
question
i
think
it
was,
i
can
--
i
realize
that
a
commonwealth
attorney,
or
attorney
general
of
virginia,
cannot
enter
into
any
commitment
to
free
people
from
prosecution
for
past
acts,
i
don't
think
he
has
that
right.
at
the
same
time
there
are
practicalities
in
this
situation.
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
authorized
us
to
say
in
the
litigation
pending
before
the
three
judge
court,
that
no
prosecutions
would
be
had
under
these
statutes
until
they
could
finally
be
determined
by
the
courts.
that
applies
to
them
all.
and
i
think
that
it
is
every
right
to
believe
that
these
lawyers
be
--
need
be
in
no
fear,
while
they
pursue
the
constitutional
questions
and
any
other
questions
that
are
involved.
certainly
they
are
pursuing
them
now.
there
has
not
been
any
reference
in
the
argument
at
all
to
a
very
important
case
and
that
is
the
alabama
case,
in
which
registration
was
involved,
i
have
no
time
to
make
the
differentiation
unless
your
honors
would
like
me
to
pursue
it,
and
i
think
our
brief
covers
it,
there
where
was
a
situation
where
the
case
had
gone
up
to
the
appellate
court
twice,
certiorari
had
been
sought
and
denied
twice,
there
was
a
fine
of
$10,000
one
day
and
it
was
$100,000
the
next.
and
it
was
obvious
that
the
people
who
were
involved
could
do
only
one
of
two
things
and
that
was
come
here
or
go
to
the
bank
and
get
the
$100,000.
now
in
virginia
the
whole
picture
is
different.
i
won't
say
the
atmosphere
of
the
two
states
are
different,
i
don't
know
that
the
atmosphere
of
alabama.
i
simply
know
the
action
is
different.
they
are
perfectly
free
here
to
pursue
their
remedies
without
risk
of
hurt,
and
the
situation
is
not
parallel
at
all.
thereto
in
alabama,
it
was
found
by
this
court
that
there
was
economic
pressure,
there
were
threats,
there
all
sorts
of
things
brought
to
bear.
but
all
of
the
testimonies
in
this
case
shows
that
the
threats
have
not
gone
beyond
the
prank
stages.
there
were
one
or
two
fiery
crosses
burnt
which
was
charged
in
part
at
least
to
a
gentleman
who
comes
visiting
our
different
states
to
serve
these
things.
there
were
other
things
in
the
prank
stage,
that's
about
as
far
as
they
got.
there
were
anonymous
phone
calls.
but
mr.
harrison
who
sponsored
these
statutes
got
the
anonymous
insulting
phone
calls
too,
just
as
people
on
the
other
side
of
this
controversy.
there
was
not
one
single
case
produced
of
economic
pressure,
of
anybody
who
was
a
member
of
naacp.
and
i'm
sure
(inaudible)
to
do
it.
it
so
happened
that
they
brought
the
testimony
in
of
one
colored
woman
from
the
city
of
charlotte
and
she
said
that
she
worked
for
some
white
folk
there
and
one
white
lady
didn't
like
it
because
she
was
a
plaintiff
in
one
of
the
school
cases
and
told
her
she
couldn't
work
for
her
anymore.
but
there
were
so
many
white
people
that
were
glad
to
have
her
services,
she
never
missed
a
lick
from
work,
she
was
working
merrily
along
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
now
that
is
the
sum
total
of
economic
pressure
in
virginia.
that
is
all
that's
shown
by
this
record.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
she
belonged
to
the
naacp
at
all,
she
was
a
plaintiff.
and
may
i
make
this
one
observation,
if
the
naacp
is
so
extremely
anxious
to
avoid
its
membership
list
being
made
public,
why
is
it,
that
instead
of
getting
one
or
two
people
to
pursue
these
school
cases,
they
get
as
many
of
them
as
possible,
instead
of
having
one
or
two
or
three
plaintiffs,
why
have
100.
and
surely,
it
must
be
obvious
to
anyone
that
economic
pressure
is
far
more
like
against
someone
who
is
actively
adjudicating
the
school
cases
as
against
the
supine
member
of
an
organization
which
has
thousands
of
members.
i
thank
you
honors.
