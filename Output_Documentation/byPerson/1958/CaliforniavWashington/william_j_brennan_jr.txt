justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
howland,
in
your
position
that
california
has
standing
to
maintain
these
actions,
there's
no
suggestion
you
say
that
the
california
wine
industry
or
members
of
it
could
not
also
maintain
an
action
of
their
own
and
they
challenge
to
these
washington
statutes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
else
is
concerned
beside
the
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
howland,
if
there
were
an
action
by
members
of
the
california
wine
industry
which
were
successful
on
an
attack
on
both
of
these
statutes
and
the
regulations
in
washington,
would
there
remain
any
other
--
anything
else
of
the
state
of
california
be
vindicated,
any
other
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
assuming
that
the
relief
on
the
merits
that
you're
insisting
upon
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
obtained
--
that
could
be
obtained,
i
take
it,
could
it
not,
in
a
--
an
action
by
the
members
of
the
california
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
so,
then
there'd
be
no
remaining
interests
to
california
to
vindicate
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
though
california
could
have
curiae
amicus
in
any
action
brought
by
california
business
that
are
not
against
washington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
-
done
recently,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what?
and
i
don't
mean
in
this
field.
what
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
one
in
texas,
the
district
court
allowed
that
one
of
the
states,
one
of
the
federal
states,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
howland,
is
the
sunkist
program
a
privately-financed
or
is
that
state-financed?
and
(inaudible)
sunkist
program
out
of
california
for
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
oranges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
privately
or
was
that
state-financed
promotion
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
potatoes,
it
was
milk,
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
will
it
bother
you
if
i
ask
you
first
to
say
whether
you
deny
that
washington
has
a
program
designed
further,
the
sale
of
washington
wine,
and
that
in
carrying
out
that
program,
one
of
the
means
is
to
curtail
the
use
of
california
wine?
is
there
a
dispute
of
fact
on
that
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr
o'connell,
i
noticed
at
page
5,
subdivision
(c)
of
paragraph
(2)
of
the
complaint,
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
discriminatory
scheme
of
regulation
is
unreasonably
distress
competition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
restrictions
in
the
hard
liquor
field?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
hardly
describe
this
program
and
washington
as
being
a
temperance
program.
