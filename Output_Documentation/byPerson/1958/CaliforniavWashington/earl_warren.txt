chief

mr.
howland,
how
does
it
happen
that
they
sell
california
wines
in
the
state
stores,
but
not
washington
wine?
chief

we'll

mr.
howland,
had
you
completed
your
opening
argument?
if
not,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howland,
is
the
--
does
the
magnitude
of
this
business
greatly
affect
your
argument
here
or
would
--
or
would
the
same
thing
apply
to
--
to
anyone
of
the
207
commercial,
agricultural
products
that
--
that
california
has?
could
they
--
would
california
have
a
program
of
this
kind
in
--
in
everyone
of
those
212
commercial
products
and
thus
--
thus
make
itself
a
plaintiff
in
an
original
action
in
this
court
to
--
against
discrimination
as
you
have
done
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
there
are
only
about
--
there
are
only
three
other
states
that
--
that
really
produce
any
--
any
wine,
washington,
michigan,
ohio,
and
new
york,
four,
i
would
say.
well
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
how
--
what
would
this
mean
monetarily
to
the
state
--
to
the
vendors
of
california
if
they
sold
all
of
the
--
the
wine
in
washington
that
--
that
they
are
not
now
selling?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
have
the
monopoly
of
all
the
wine
--
wine
in
washington,
how
much
would
it
mean
in
dollars?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
much
--
how
--
what
percentage
of
the
wine
--
wines
that
are
sold
in
washington
are
california
wines?
chief
justice
earl
warren
45%?
and
roughly,
what
is
the
total
value
of
--
of
the
wine
sold
in
washington?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
winery
level.
well,
then
--
then
this
would
probably
amount
to
about
$3,000,000
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
go
55%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all
--
all
states
don't
consume
the
same
amount
of
wine
per
capita,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
states
did
not
use
the
same
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
amount
of
wine
per
capita.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pretty
hard
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
determine
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howland,
one
--
one
thing
that
bothers
me
is
this
that
as
you
know,
there
are
a
tremendous
number
of
trade
barriers
throughout
the
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
there
are
very
few
states
that
are
not
affected
adversely
by
one
or
another
or
maybe
many
of
those
trade
barriers
or
so.
now,
does
your
argument
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
if
any
trade
barrier
raised
by
a
state
adversely
affects
any
segment
of
the
economy
of
another,
does
that
gives
the
state
the
right
to
bring
an
original
action
against
the
other
in
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
you
differentiate
and
--
and
just
try
to
tell
me
where
the
--
where
the
line
is
drawn
because
that
--
that
does
bother
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
it
could
occur
in
--
in
any
--
any
state
or
in
any
--
any
product,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
have
or
did
--
or
did
have
in
california
a
number
of
marketing
orders
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
were
somewhat
in
the
same
relationship
as
this.
is
it
your
belief
that
in
any
of
those
instances,
california,
because
it
had
evolved
these
marketing
orders,
would
have
the
right
to
represent
that
segment
of
the
industry
and
original
action?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that's
an
incident
that
it
could
--
it
could
very,
very
easily,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
but
wouldn't
it
--
wouldn't
it
be
a
very
easy
step
to
--
to
put
a
clause
of
that
kind
in
each
marketing
order
where
--
wherein
would
it
be
different
with
any
--
any
industry,
take
the
--
take
the
peach
industry
or
any
other
industry.
why
couldn't
we
do
the
same
thing
there
as
we
do
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
the
mere
--
do
you
rest
your
case
then
on
the
fact
that
the
state
has
adopted
this
program?
is
that
--
if
--
if
you
didn't
have
this
program,
would
the
state
be
in
here
as
if
in
the
position
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
properly
here
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
think
properly
here
because
of
the
importance
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
o'donnell
or
o'connell,
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
what
the
dollar
volume
is
mr.
attorney
general?
