justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
suppose
prior
with
that,
the
fact
the
suits
could
be
brought
as
they
bring
complete
relief
might
be
relevant
consideration
from
the
court
in
determining
whether
(inaudible)
would
it
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
connection
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
--
what
constitutional
provision
do
you
rely
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
sanction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
the
twenty-first
amendment
give
washington
the
right
and
power
to
dispose
of
liquors
and
wines
that
it
sees
fit?
is
that
the
issue
between
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
it
very
near
this
case
if
--
if
washington
has
--
was
granted
power
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
have
a
liquor
business
as
it
saw
fit
without
regard
of
the
liquor
from
any
other
place
or
any
other
town,
how
could
it
not
be
limited
to
its
own
people,
production
or
limited
to
production
--
any
production
(inaudible)
if
they're
given
exclusive
power
by
that
amendment
to
control
the
liquor
ban
without
regard
with
the
commerce
clause
and
the
other
clauses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
seems
to
me
frankly
from
my
view
point,
that's
the
issue.
i
--
i
have
some
familiarity
with
that
with
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
the
--
the
time
it
started
--
before
it
started
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
decisive,
is
it
not,
if
it
decided
one
more
here,
it
disposes
of
any
reason
to
go
any
further,
was
that
not
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
question,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
at
this
time
in
that
--
on
that
amendment,
the
question
whether
the
--
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
designedly
intended.
the
--
it
was
--
whether
it
was
intended
to
leave
the
states,
free
to
handle
liquor
ban
to
keep
the
federal
government
out
of
it
entirely
on
any
--
any
score
on
any
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
said
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
recall
that
new
york
within
the
state
was
the
most
insistent
that
before
that
amendment
was
adopted
through
the
effect
that
everything
that
--
that
should
be
able
to
appeal,
everything
should
be
left
to
the
state
to
decide
the
matters
if
so
fit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
state
i
think
came
to
the
main
arguments
in
favor
of
that
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
a
little
more
than
that.
the
intendment
was
to
do
away
with
prohibition
as
a
national
doctrine,
and
as
a
national
law
and
to
leave
it
up
to
the
state
to
determine
wholly
for
itself
what
would
happen
in
its
boundaries
of
reference
to
the
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
if
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
similarity
between
your
raisin
program
and
the
washington
wine
program?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
we
had
up
some
years
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
just
thought
you'd
know
whether
that
was
--
what
your
program
did
so
if
we
could
--
if
that's
the
case,
it
gets
down
probably
to
a
question
of
whether
the
twenty-first
amendment
controlled
it
which
might
have
to
be
decided
or
might
probably
be
decided
at
this
time.
if
--
if
washington
is
doing
it
and
says
it's
doing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
one
of
the
consequences
might
result
from
not
knowing
whether
that
is
a
bonafide
issue
of
opinions,
that
is,
if
the
court
might
do
(inaudible)
that
--
but
should
not
the
right
kind
of
case
to
decide
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
do
argue
the
substantive
questions
in
the
third
subdivision
of
your
brief
with
reference
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
take
the
words,
you
use
there
as
the
standard,
which
one
of
three
would
you
say
is
not
met
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
allegations
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
to
a
substantial
portion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
you
think
substantial
(inaudible)
if
that's
the
standard
or
the
keyword?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
say
the
grapes
people
--
all
the
people
that
raise
grapes
which
is
the
biggest
farm
crop
they
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
the
automobile
industry,
for
instance,
would
be
--
affect
the
substantial
number
of
people
in
michigan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
would
have
standing
in
the
new
york
or
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
question
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
washington
constitution
permit
suits
to
be
brought
against
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
even
have
to
go
through
the
suit
of
the
(inaudible)
officially
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
direct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can
do
either?
