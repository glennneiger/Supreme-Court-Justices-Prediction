mr.
john
j.
o'connell
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
distinguished
counsel.
to
answer
first
an
inquiry
by
justice
brennan
in
regards
to
the
attorney
general
as
amicus,
in
our
brief,
we
cite
verbatim
--
report
verbatim
a
case
called
(inaudible)
versus
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
it
was
milk.
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
attorney
general
appeared
as
amicus.
if
i
might
just
capsulize
the
facts
of
each,
california
produces
more
than
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
--
85%
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
do
not
recall,
your
honor,
exactly
what
the
precise
allegations
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint
are
in
that
regard.
i
do
not
know
whether
he
specifically
alleges
that
washington
is
in
a
conspiracy
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well,
whether
washington
specifically
does
that
or
not,
i
don't
know
whether
he
still
alleges
but
of
course,
if
he
does,
we
would
have
to
admit
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument.
but,
were
we
allowed
or
would
this
matter
proceed
further,
we
would
make
certain
affirmative
allegations
in
that
and
attempt
to
show
otherwise.
does
your
honor
understand
me?
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
practically
couldn't
say,
your
honor.
i
imagine
that
one
could
get
varying
opinions
from
the
effect
of
washington's
statutes.
i
know
privately,
i
thought,
that
washington
discriminated
against
its
own
wine
and
found
out
later
that
it
was
alleged
in
many
sources
that
washington
in
fact
discriminated
it
against
california
wine.
and
that's
because,
if
i
should
go
to
a
state
liquor
store,
i
couldn't
buy
washington
wine
but
i
could
buy
california.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well,
for
that
purpose,
your
honor,
perhaps
we
would
say,
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
we
admit
as
true
california's
allegations
and
we
will
assume
they
go
that
far.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
precise
allegations
to
california
contain
that
fact
or
not.
but
i
assume
the
entire
purport
and
intent
of
california's
allegations
are
in
that
direction.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well,
california
does
allege
that
washington
treats
california
wine
differently
than
it
does
washington
wine
or
domestic
wine
and
that
the
effects
of
these
treatment
is
to
damage
the
state
in
its
governmental
interests
and
it's
private
citizens
in
their
economic
interests.
what
california
does
definitely
make
that
allegation
that
the
effects
of
washington's
statute
are
discriminatory
to
california's
interest.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
then
if
that
is
in
the
complaint,
your
honor,
we
admit
it
to
be
true
for
this
purpose
that
the
purpose
was
discrimination.
then
it
is
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that
is
precisely
our
defense,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
we
have
to.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
we
did
not
bring
this
complaint.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
--
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
--
we
are
required
to
take
this
position.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
be
perfectly
fair
in
this
regard
too
and
not
take
undue
advantage
to
california
because
it
is
substantially
alleged
partly
that
this
is
the
effect
of
washington's
regulations.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
we
do,
we
do.
and
as
the
court
can
clearly
see,
there
are
not
--
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
and
i
would
hesitate
to
say
which
of
the
two
is
the
most
important
or
the
more
important
and
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court
in
this
brief
time,
i
will
address
myself
to
the
first,
that
of
original
jurisdiction
and
my
associate
mr.
garrington
will
address
himself
fully
to
the
second,
that
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
other
constitutional
involvements.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
exactly.
our
statutory
distinction
is
between
domestic
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
--
and
non-domestic.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
it
has
been
pointed
out,
california
has
85%
of
the
national
market
including
wines
from
other
countries.
there
are
four
states
that
engage
in
some
wine-producing
activity,
new
york,
ohio,
michigan,
washington,
roughly
in
that
order.
california
sells
45%
of
the
wine
consumed
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
domestic
winery
sell
50%,
other
wine
in
the
states
and
foreign
wine
from
out
of
the
united
states
comprise
5%.
the
total
consumption
is
slightly
in
excess
of
2,000,000
million
gallons
per
year.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
have
it
some
place
but
it
isn't
immediately
available.
washington
by
statute
and
regulations
confined,
first
of
all,
it's
a
monopoly
state.
all
liquor
is
involved
with
the
state
of
washington.
hard
liquor,
if
i
might
use
that
expression,
distilled
spirits
have
to
be
sold
through
a
state
monopoly
store.
beer
can
be
sold
anywhere
without
regard
to
the
state
monopoly
store.
the
statutes
make
a
distinction
on
domestic
and
non-domestic
wine.domestic
wine
can
be
sold
directly
through
a
wholesaler
to
a
retail.
non-domestic
wine
has
to
be
sold
through
the
state
monopoly
board.
the
only
purchaser
directly
of
non-domestic
wine
in
the
state
of
washington
is
the
state
liquor
control
board.
in
this
instance,
it
buys
california
wine
in
california
f.o.b.
it
ships
it
to
its
warehouse
within
the
state
of
washington.
it
disperses
without
further
costs
to
its
various
retail
store
outlets
around
the
state
from
which
it
is
purchased
by
the
eventual
consumer.
the
argument
of
california
in
regard
to
original
jurisdiction
is
basically
threefold.
number
one,
they
say
that
the
pure
governmental
interest
of
the
state
of
california
is
restrictive.
number
two,
they
say
they
have
the
responsibility
by
the
declarations
of
their
legislature
to
commence
and
initiate
actions
of
this
kind.
number
three,
they
say
because
of
the
possible
damage
to
their
private
citizens
by
the
activities
of
the
state
of
washington,
they
have
the
duty
to
bring
suit
in
a
quasi-sovereign
capacity.
california
urges
that
this
case
in
regard
to
original
jurisdiction
is
unique.
it's
unique
in
its
factual
pattern
as
perhaps
all
cases
are.
but
it
is
certainly
not
unique
to
this
court
in
its
question
of
original
jurisdiction.
in
answer
to
california's
argument,
number
one,
that
they
had
a
pure
governmental
interest
involved
in
this
case,
it
is
our
position
that
the
agency
of
the
state
of
california
created
through
its
agricultural
code
and
a
marketing
order
which
sort
of
puts
the
state,
if
you
please,
in
the
wine
business.
we
contend
that
our
statutes
and
our
regulations
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
official
arm
of
the
state
of
california.
all
of
our
regulations
are
directed
to
manufacturers,
seller,
wholesalers.
they
can't
do
this
or
that
in
regard
to
non-domestic
wine.
california
by
its
very
constitution
prohibits
the
state
of
california
from
being
a
manufacturer
or
a
seller
of
wine.
how
in
the
world
then,
if
california
contends
that
this
arm
of
the
state
of
california
is
the
state
of
california
in
its
sovereign
capacity,
how
in
the
world
then
does
the
state
of
washington
restrict
the
activities
of
the
state
of
california?
of
course,
we
do
not.
nor
is
this
quibbling
on
our
part.
we
do
believe
if
the
state
is
suing
in
a
purely
proprietary
or
government
capacity
it
must
stand
and
fall
as
an
individual,
integral
party
plaintiff
in
that
regard.
however,
california
alleges
that
because
of
the
effect
of
our
regulations
on
its
private
businessmen,
they
are
somewhat
affected
because
their
whole
program
is
disturbed
by
our
specific
regulations
or
statutes
that
refer
to
their
private
citizens.
we
have
cited
to
your
honors
to
many
cases
in
this
regard
specifically
if
california
has
any
interest
because
of
that
indirect
connection
at
all.
we
have
cited
the
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper
case,
where
the
state
of
georgia
claimed
it
had
some
interest
because
its
rules
were
being
eroded
by
the
action
of
the
noxious
gases
of
the
tennessee
company.
this
court
calls
such
interest
to
make
way
similarly,
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania.
the
interest
of
the
state
as
the
owner
of
a
railroad
or
of
many
--
the
owner
of
many
institutions
needing
railroad
services
this
court
also
called
such
an
alleged
direct
interest
make
way.
we
have
referred
your
honors
to
the
case
in
this
regard
of
oklahoma
versus
cook
which
we
think
somewhat
directly
parallels
this
instant
case.
in
the
case
of
oklahoma
versus
cook,
by
the
oklahoma
statutes,
the
state
itself
brought
an
action
following
the
insolvency
of
a
bank
against
the
shareholders
of
the
bank
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
california,
in
its
briefs
states
this,
the
wine
sales
promotion
activities
of
the
state
are
those
of
a
commercial
or
industrial
organization
promoting
nationwide
sales
of
its
products.
in
the
oklahoma
case,
the
court
said
the
protection
of
depositors
of
insolvent
state
banks
as
a
distinct
economic
policy
of
the
state
oklahoma.
and
our
court
said
this,
“we
must
look
beyond
the
mere
legal
title
of
the
complaining
state
to
the
cause
of
action
asserted
into
the
nature
of
the
state's
interest
further.
but
this
principle
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
permit
resort
to
our
original
jurisdiction
in
the
name
of
the
state,
but
in
reality,
for
the
benefit
of
particular
individuals.”
albeit,
the
state
assert
economic
interest
in
the
claims
and
declare
their
enforcement
to
be
a
matter
of
state
policy.
california's
second
argument
can
be
quickly
disposed
of,
in
our
opinion.
the
legislative
declarations
of
the
legislature
of
california
have
urged
the
proper
officials
of
california
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
to
bring
actions
to
a
limit
--
to
eliminate
trade
barriers
with
--
with
specific
reference
to
the
wine
industry,
now
under
consideration.
of
course,
this
argument
has
been
early
answered
and
often
answered
by
this
court.
an
individual
state
legislature
cannot
give
it
state
power
of
its
state
powers
that
would
cause
it
to
have
an
original
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
this
court
is
the
decider
of
that
issue.
the
early
case
was
that
of
new
hampshire
versus
louisiana,
a
case
again
similar
was
the
case
just
cited
the
case
of
oklahoma
versus
cook.
california
must
have
this
power
or
this
right
of
original
jurisdiction
directly
in
her
own
right
and
not
because
of
anything,
her
legislature
however,
impelling
that
might
be
to
the
people
of
california.
the
third
argument
of
california
is
that
it
has
original
jurisdiction
because
of
the
economic
interest
of
its
citizens.
we
have
done
a
little
mathematics
in
our
brief
in
regard
to
the
amount
or
the
quantum
of
this
interest
affected.
and
we
assume
but
that
by
some
wizardry,
the
state
of
california
would
gather
in
the
entire
washington
state
wine
market.
and
we
compared
the
amount
that
would
be
in
comparison
to
the
general
farming
economy
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
economic
impact
assuming
this
unlikely
fact
of
total
appropriation
of
the
washington
wine
industry
or
the
washington
wine
market
is
18
thousands
of
1%.
that
is
the
impact
on
the
farm
economy
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
have
not
made
a
thorough
study,
your
honor
of
other
states.
but
i
think
that
michigan
does
somewhat,
similar
activity
to
the
state
of
washington,
but
exactly
what
other
states
do
this,
in
what
regard,
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
don't
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
oh,
by
all
means.
if
california
sold
85%
of
the
national
wine
market,
it
can
be
readily
seen
how
much
wine
goes
out
of
california.
although,
as
mr.
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
consumption
ratio
of
states
is
different.
california's
rate
of
consumption,
for
example,
is
twice
that
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
in
relation
to
the
same
question,
the
economic
interest
of
the
state
of
california,
suing
a
quasi-sovereign
capacity
as
parens
patriae,
there
are
many
cases
as
the
court
well
knows.
these
cases
generally
have
three
requirements
number
one;
the
injury
or
threatened
injury
must
be
to
all
the,
or
a
substantial
portion
of
the
state's
citizens.
number
two
the
threat
must
be
to
the
health,
safety
and
general
welfare
of
those
citizens.
number
three;
the
invasion
must
be
of
serious
magnitude.
the
court
well
knows
that
most
of
these
cases
divide
themselves
into
three
groups
boundary,
disputes,
water
diversion
cases
and
cases
of
pollution
or
public
nuisance.
in
all
of
these
of
cases,
the
court
explored
the
facts
thoroughly
in
order
to
find
a
genuine
sovereign
interest,
a
fact
that
would
seem
to
be
lacking
in
this
case.
the
two
cases
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
the
genuine
sovereign
interest
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
--
because
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
two.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
the
injury
is
not
to
all
or
a
substantial
portion
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
right.
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
--
although,
that
again
could
be
a
matter
of
opinion.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well,
i
think
the
substantial
portion
means
a
great
deal
more
than
the
wineries
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
true,
but
it
isn't
as
big
as
it
would
appear.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
it
isn't
as
big
as
it
would
appear.
i
think,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
it
represents
4%
of
agriculture
economy
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
it
might
under
some
circumstances.
if
i
might
point
this
out
a
little
further,
your
honor,
and
take
the
two
cases
that
are
a
little
bit
different
than
the
standard,
quasi-sovereign
cases,
that's
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia
and
georgia
versus
pennsylvania.
in
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia,
west
virginia
restricted
the
interstate
transportation
of
its
natural
gas,
to
pennsylvania
and
ohio,
states
that
had
been
using
that
natural
gas
in
their
industry
and
then
their
homes
for
many,
many
years.
and
this
is
what
this
court
said
about
the
magnitude
or
the
impact
of
that
invasion.
the
private
consumers
in
each
state
not
only
include
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
many
urban
communities
but
constitute
a
substantial
portion
of
the
state's
population.
their
health,
comfort
and
welfare
are
seriously
jeopardized
by
the
threatened
withdrawal
of
the
gas
from
the
interstate
stream.
this
is
a
matter
of
grave
public
concern
in
which
the
state
as
the
representative
of
the
public
has
an
interest
apart
from
that
of
the
individuals
affected.
and
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
regard
to
the
magnitude
of
the
matter
involved.georgia
as
a
representative
of
the
public
is
complaining
of
her
role
which
they
have
proven
limits
the
opportunities
of
her
people,
shackles
her
industries,
retards
her
development
and
relegates
her
to
an
inferior
economic
position
among
her
sister
states.
these
are
matters
of
grave
public
concern
in
which
georgia
has
an
interest
apart
from
that
of
the
particular
individuals
who
may
be
affected.
and
indeed,
in
these
two
somewhat
extensions
of
the
basic
quasi-sovereign
cases,
the
court
can
readily
see
how
strong
the
impact
of
the
invasion
laws
on
those
two
cases.
in
the
instant
case
if
i
submit,
this
invasion
--
this
impact,
this
magnitude
does
not
exist.
we
say
that
the
real
parties
and
interest
in
this
case
is
not
the
state
of
california.
the
real
party
and
interest
is
the
private
wine
industry
of
california
and
i
submit,
perhaps
only
the
larger
or
the
most
important,
of
these
particular
wine.
finally
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
do
indeed,
sir.
and
in
that
regard,
we
argue
that
this
court
is
not
the
proper
forum
to
decide
the
matters
in
this
case.
in
louisiana
versus
texas,
this
court
said
jurisdictions,
they
gave
original
jurisdiction
is
a
so
delicate
and
grave
in
character
that
it
was
not
contemplated
that
it
would
be
exercised,
save
when
the
necessity
was
absolute.
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
sparingly,
carefully
and
gravely
given.
i
am
not
one
to
speak
with
authority
on
the
dockets
of
this
court
but
may
i
say
this,
commodity
commissions
of
the
type
involved
here
are
a
growing
thing.
the
number
runs
in
my
mind
in
the
state
of
california
in
the
amount
of
47.
i
don't
claim
that
to
be
wholly
accurate
but
i
know
that
there
are
dozens
of
these
commissions
engaged
in
the
trade
promotion,
advertising
and
research
activities
of
the
various
products
they
are
designed
to
promote.
these
products
are
principally
in
interstate
commerce
particularly
with
respect
to
california.
these
products
in
the
main,
will
go
outside
the
state
of
california.
i
can
speak
for
our
state
which
is
new
in
this
commodity
commission
way
of
doing
business.
we
already,
although
we
started
much
later
than
in
california,
have
seven
of
these
commissions.
i
could
imagine
if
jurisdiction
were
granted
in
this
instance
that
any
group
of
citizens
engaged
in
the
business
of
any
kind
can
find
a
denying
state
to
act
in
a
so
--
somewhat
governmental
capacity
towards
them.
and
finding,
thereby,
some
discrimination
in
some
state
of
the
union
to
which
they
export,
come
to
this
court
and
on
the
basis
of
finding
an
original
jurisdiction,
herein,
ask
the
court
for
an
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
again,
your
honor,
the
matter
is
just
one
of
magnitude.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
and
if
the
court
desires
to
open
up
these
gates
to
this
type
of
activity
toward
a
course
as
its
own
desire
in
that
regard.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
although
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
if
it
isn't,
it
should
be.
and
certainly,
we
would
have
a
right
to
rely
on
the
consistency
in
that
regard
and
i
could
think
in
our
own
state
of
two
or
three
suits
that
we
would
be
interested
in
exploring
possibilities
of
instituting
in
regard
to
our
commodity
commissions.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
that
wholeheartedly
and
in
the
west
virginia
case,
the
impact
was
of
a
substantial
nature
involving
a
great
many
of
the
citizens
of
both
states.
although
counsel
for
california
has
indicated
that
there
might
not
be
a
factual
dispute
in
this
regard,
i
think
your
honors
can
clearly
see
that
there
very
possibly
would
be
such
a
factual
dispute.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
the
question
of
temperance
in
the
state
of
california
or
in
the
state
of
washington
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
temperance,
the
promotion
of
temperance
by
these
regulations.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion,
if
your
honor,
please.
but
i
don't
think
it's
without
the
realm
of
possibility
that
should
these
restrictions
be
dissolved,
the
state
of
washington
would
be
deluge
by
highly
competitive
cheap
wine
that
would
certainly
increase
the
per
capita
consumption
of
our
citizens.
that
is
a
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
there
are
none.
do
you
mean
there
are
no
discriminatory
restrictions
in
that
sense?
but,
of
course,
our
law
was
always
monopoly
for
distilled
spirits
or
hard
liquor
and
we
have
no
comparable
area
with
which
to
compare
the
consumption
in
that
regard.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
but,
i
think
if
your
honor
will
find
many
of
these
cases
in
the
twenty-first
amendment
field,
that
is
one
of
the
matters
in
which
the
court
has
seen
fit
to
be
interested.
we'll
be
interested
in
the
quality
of
the
non-domestic
wine,
the
reasonableness
of
our
regulations,
matters
of
that
kind.
the
--
this
case
can
be
totally
disposed
as
it
was
mentioned
somewhat
yesterday
where
the
fact
that
there
was
another
form
available,
had
any
effect
upon
this
court
granting
jurisdiction
originally.
every
allegation
in
california's
complaint
and
every
remedy
which
california
seeks
can
be
obtained
at
one
suit.
this
isn't
the
case
like
georgia
versus
tennessee
proper
where
there
were
a
numerous
--
or
there
were
numerous
citizens
that
would
have
to
bring
a
multiplicity
of
suits.
one
suit
could
answer
this.
we
submit
that
that
suit
can
be
brought
either
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
washington
or
in
the
federal
courts
within
its
boundaries
and
every
issue
therein
can
be
decided.
washington
is
not
going
to
run
away.
it
is
servable
and
it
is
suable
in
either
of
the
courts
that
i
refer
to.
and
every
matter
raised
in
this
complaint
of
california
can
be
resolved
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
we
submit,
you
can
do
that
also.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes.
thank
you,
your
honors.
