justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
were
--
you
do
not
intend
to
address
yourself
to
the
merits
of
the
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
gathered
that
--
that
the
merits
are
going
to
be
strikingly
treated
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
will
be
moved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
ohio
an
important
state
of
production
line?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
wines
consumed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
you
think
it
describes
me
and
i
heard,
you
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
of
all
the
wines
consumed
in
continent
of
the
united
states,
of
all
the
wines,
importation
from
the
plants
is
relief
(inaudible)
itself
of
all
the
wines.
85%
of
the
total
is
california
product.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
washington
--
is
washington
exporters,
so
to
speak,
for
the
other
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
that
the
state
consumes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
howland,
would
you
be
here
if
washington
decided
to
be
a
dry
state?
in
other
words,
to
ban
all
liquors
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
domestically
created
or
brought
in
from
without?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
if
she
--
if
she
allows
--
if
she
(inaudible)
the
liquor
traffic,
and
she
--
then
she
can
pay
(inaudible)
are
all
producers,
if
we're
taking
california
and
new
york
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
my
memory
versus
yours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
in
the
georgia
--
georgia
and
tennessee
copper.
i
suppose
the
individual
concern
that
were
affected
by
the
fumes
tennessee
copper
would've
brought
some
--
assuming
there
was
--
could've
bought
suit
against
the
tennessee
copper
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
nuisance
against
them
and
individual
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose,
indeed,
the
river
in
new
jersey
and
the
case
involving
delaware
river,
i
suppose,
the
misuse
of
the
river
in
individual
riparian
owner
might
as
if
the
cause
of
action
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wouldn't
necessarily
displace
through
either
the
state
to
sue,
because
of
pervasive
effect
upon
the
state
interest.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
this
case,
but
i
do
not
think
the
mere
fact
that
individuals
may
impose
rights
to
preclude
the
states
from
having
an
interest.
it
exceeded
those
of
the
individuals
put
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
conflict
between
you
and
the
attorney
general
of
washington
that
washington
in
fact
purposed
discrimination
against
california
wine?
is
that
contested
in
this
case?
or
is
the
question
merely
whether
washington
can
promote
its
own
wine
industry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
--
have
we
started
at
the
fact
that
washington
is
seeking
to
exclude
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
is
california
wines?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wondered
therefore
whether
it's
necessary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
prove
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
start
off
from
there,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
california
wine
had
to
be
transported
into
to
get
in
to
washington?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
washington
keep
it
out
altogether?
keep
--
keep
out
california
wine
and
allow
the
vending,
to
sale,
exclusively,
of
washington
wine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
s
why,
mr.
(inaudible)
you
said
you're
going
to
address
yourself
to
it
briefly.
that
implies
that
it's
so
obvious
or
so
predominantly
obvious
that
you
don't
have
to
pay
much
attention
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
the
essential
nature
of
the
--
isn't
that
the
essence
of
the
question
namely,
whether
the
twenty-first
amendment
limited
itself
to
the
old
cases
--
i'm
doing
the
old
cases
in
re
rahrer
and
so
on
or
whether,
and
it's
so
often
of
a
case,
when
congress
begins
to
deal
with
the
subject
either
by
statute
or
submission
of
an
amendment,
it
goes
beyond
the
cases
of
this
court
which
it
seeks
to
affect.
isn't
that
the
real
question
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
not
could
be,
isn't
it?
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
suggesting
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
if
the
amendment
goes
beyond
those
cases,
then,
it
is
enough
to
show
that
what
washington
did
was
to
go
beyond
those
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
washington
treating
california
differently
than
it's
treating
ohio
and
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
discrimination
--
i'm
not
using
that
legal
term
but
the
differentiation
that
washington
makes
is
between
wine
from
washington
and
wine
coming
from
any
other
47
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
question
whether
she
can
make
that
discrimination
is
the
heart
of
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
pleading
myself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
course,
if
my
previous
opinion
in
the
(inaudible)
i've
had
my
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
should
like
to
join
justice
black
has
indicating
that
at
least
for
one
more
member
of
this
court,
that
seems
to
me
the
crucial
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
you
hurdle,
the
question
of
standards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
--
the
threshold
query
so
that's
--
that's
not
a
constitutional
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i'm
--
i'm
surprised
--
or
rather
i
was
surprised
that
we've
talked
about
it
(inaudible)
that
you're
remarking
--
address
yourself
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
briefly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
implied
to
me
that
you
thought
that
was
an
easy
aspect
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me,
it's
the
most
difficult.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
would
you
prefer
to
leave
it
on
the
brief?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
saying
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
isn't
so
all-inclusive
that
no
other
provisions
of
constitution,
such
as
when
treating
new
york
and
california
different,
in
showing
the
preference
from
new
york
and
against
california
is
within
the
scope
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
as
a
practical
fact,
why
do
you
take
that
position.
why
is
it
--
do
you
not
say,
i'm
asking.
but,
of
course,
it
affects
the
wine
industry
and
the
money
that's
made
by
private
people
who
own
it
but
the
relation
to
the
wine
industry
to
the
economy
of
the
whole
state
as
such,
that
it
has
deeper
significance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
say
if
you
can't
take
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
roads
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
roads
--
the
upkeep
of
roads
derive
largely
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
highway
taxes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
couldn't
you
--
couldn't
california
start
the
litigation
even
in
the
state
court
of
washington
or
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states,
district
court
in
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
says
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
come
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
could
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
you
--
couldn't
california
sue
the
washington
state
of
officials
on
the
basis
of
ex
parte
young?
if
your
claim
is
right,
then
--
then
the
-
the
(inaudible)
of
washington
are
null
and
void
and
as
for
the
officials
of
washington
are
acting
out
--
they
are
acting
illegally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
these
are
the
questions
of
this
mr.
howland.
but,
of
course,
either
--
either
in
a
controversy
between
the
state
and
the
state,
this
court
(inaudible)
evidence
is
required.
all
your
argument
is
based
on
the
assumption,
i
think,
(inaudible)
judicial
notice
of
economics,
facts
and
the
consequences
of
those
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
--
you
would
say
except
(inaudible)
because
--
unless
i'm
wrong,
the
wine
industry
is
more
important
than
the
raisin
industry.
is
it
in
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
relation
to
economy
is
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
to
justice
black's
question
may
be
important
at
least
to
some
of
us
because
if
you
can't
state
that,
that
is
a
question
of
fact
whether
there
is
discrimination,
and
we
may
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
whether
discrimination
is
permitted
under
--
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i,
for
one,
don't
want
the
consent
of
admission
which
may
be
contrary
to
fact
on
the
basis
of
which
a
constitutional
opinion
should
be
elicited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
counsel,
not
even
the
attorney
general
of
two
states
can
agree
on
--
on
a
hypothetical
case
in
order
to
elicit
from
this
court
a
constitutional
adjudication.
as
justice
black
has
indicated,
we
have
refused
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
any
--
any
action
or
pleading
on
your
part
not
within
your
appropriate
powers.
i'm
merely
suggesting
the
difficulty
of
a
ourt
bounded
in
--
this
court
is
in
dealing
with
hypothetical
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
don't
care
on
what
ground
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
questions
from
the
bench
elicit
that
it's
a
hypothetical
case,
then
the
court
regards
that
in
arguments
and
that,
i
take
it,
is
the
inference
drawn
from
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question.
you're
in
a
comfortable
position
if
i
may
say
so.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
states
doing
that
which
washington
is
argumentatively
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
state
that
mr.
attorney,
what
percentage
of
california
wine
goes
outside
of
california,
roughly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
problem
before
us
may
be
beyond
washington
in
isolation
vis-à-vis
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does
make
a
difference
in
life
than
an
industry
plays
a
major
part
in
the
well
being
and
the
economic
well
being
of
a
state
as
against
some
industry
(inaudible)
part
and
if
it
plays
that
important
part
in
life,
why
shouldn't
in
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
these
questions
usually
are
questions
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--if
you
open
a
gate,
you
don't
have
to
let
everybody
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
west
virginia
against
pennsylvania,
the
other
way
around
(inaudible)
the
question
of
quantity
if
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
quantity
is
a
--
is
a
function
of
this
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
california
wine
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
--
mr.
attorney,
is
there
anything
in
the
available
legislative
history
meaning
by
that
the
(inaudible)
statements
by
those
who
spoke
to
the
--
submitted
the
amendment
either
in
the
senate
or
house
or
where
there
reports
which
give
any
light
on
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
in
charge
of
the
proposed
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
true
--
if
that
is
true,
certainly,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
rely
on?
what
does
washington
rely
on?
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
responsible
spokesman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
submission
of
the
amendment
does
washington
rely
on,
a
shedding
light?
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
