well,
at
the
present
time,
the
state
--
the
california
wine
is
the
--
is
the
wine
that
is
sold
in
the
state
stores
in
washington,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
not
--
it's
the
only
wine,
i
think,
that's
sold,
is
it
not,
in
the
state
stores
of
washington?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
know
what
percentage
of
the
market
in
the
--
the
state
stores
of
washington
that
california
has?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
a
very
large
percentage,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
--
the
only
wines
i've
seen
in
the
state
stores
in
washington
are
california
wines.
and
there'd
be
others.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
complaint
here
is
that
you
can't
sell
in
the
grocery
stores
and
--
and
other
retail
outlets
in
washington,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
grocery
stores.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
--
as
i
remember
in
the
state
of
washington,
you
can
buy
washington
wine
in
your
corner
grocery
store,
but
you
can't
buy
california
wine
there.
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
--
if
the
retail
stores
in
the
same
basis
as
washington
state
wine,
is
that
right?
it
can't
--
it
can't
be
carried
by
the
retail
grocery
on
the
same
basis
as
he
can
carry
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
washington
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
your
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
the
complaint?
is
that
the
basis
of
the
complaint
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
that
it
can't
--
it
doesn't
have
the
same
access
to
the
state
liquor
stores
as
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
to
the
retail
outlet?
justice
william
o.
douglas
can't
sell
to
the
state
liquor
stores.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
it
was
the
--
that
it
is
--
that
the
pressure
of
the
interest
of
the
washington
state
wine
liquors
restrict
california
to
the
state
liquor
stores.
that
was
the
reason.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
washington
wanted
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
if
washington
provided
that
california
wine
could
be
admitted
only
for
say,
religious
purposes
or
medicinal
purposes,
would
you
have
any
question
here?
