mr.
wallace
howland
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
on
behalf
of
the
motion
made
by
the
state
of
california.
california,
as
leave
of
the
court,
with
permission
to
file
a
complaint
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
the
defendant
is
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
two
states
are
the
only
parties
to
the
proceeding.
the
case
involves
trade
barriers
between
those
two
states.
washington
has
discriminated
and
thus
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
in
wine.
in
so
doing,
washington
denies
the
citizens
of
other
states,
trade
privileges,
in
the
sale
and
distribution
of
wine,
which
it
freely
accords
to
its
own
citizens.
it
does
so
in
order
to
protect
its
own
wine
industry
against
the
competition
of
out-of-state
and
foreign
wines.
and
for
this,
we
submit,
there
is
no
sanction
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
violated
by
these
statutes,
another
official
acts
of
the
state
of
washington,
are
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
state
of
california
itself,
as
a
state,
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
its
citizens
and
industry.
the
purpose
of
this
action
is
to
enjoin
official
acts
of
the
state
of
washington
which,
we
submit,
violate
the
federal
constitution.
supporting
the
position
taken
by
california
in
this
case,
the
state
of
new
york
has
filed
a
brief,
amicus
curiae.
this
was
(inaudible)
from
a
significant
source,
because
second
only
to
the
state
of
california,
the
state
of
new
york
is
the
next
largest
wine-producing
state
in
the
union.
washington
opposes
the
filing
of
this
complaint.
the
principle
argument
is
that
california
has
no
standing
to
sue,
that
it
is
not
a
proper
plaintiff.
and
that
in
filing
--
this
seeking
to
file
its
complaint,
the
california
is
acting
only
as
a
nominal
plaintiff
on
behalf
of
its
wine
industry
and
the
members
of
its
wine
industry.
issue
has
been
joined
on
this
point
in
the
briefs
which
have
been
filed.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
my
main
effort,
in
this
oral
argument,
will
be
addressed
to
the
proposition
that
--
that
california
thus
have
standing
to
sue.
indeed,
i
shall
show
that
california
is
the
only
plaintiff
legally
capable
of
bringing
this
action.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
complaint
amongst
other
things,
alleges
an
injury
to
the
state
as
--
that
is
to
say
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
state
government.
the
complaint
in
this
case
discloses
two
aspects
to
the
case.
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
a
case
of
the
type
which
is
some
--
has
previously
been
before
the
court,
where
a
state
sues
his
plaintiff
in
the
role
of
parens
patriae
to
assert
its
--
to
assert
an
injury
to
its
quasi-sovereign
rights
and
where
it
is
suing
on
cause
of
--
causes
of
action,
which
it
derives
from
its
citizens.
that
is
one
aspect
of
the
case.
but
also
very
much
in
the
case
and
which
bears
directly
upon
this
question
of
california
standing
to
sue
is
the
fact
that
california
alleges
its
own
cause
of
action.
california
has
searched
that
it,
as
a
state,
independently
of
its
citizens,
has
been
denied
constitutional
rights
which
it
enjoys.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
i
said
that
my
--
my
principal
effort
in
this
argument,
with
the
court's
permission,
would
be
to
demonstrate
california
standing
to
sue.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
i
will
do
it
if
he
reminds.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes.
mr.
wallace
howland
in
the
--
in
--
in
establishing
california
standing
to
sue,
i
think
that
there's
no
great
disagreement
concerning
the
applicable
law.
in
order
to
invoke
the
--
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
the
complaint
state
must
establish
two
things.
and
i'm
speaking
now,
particularly
about
the
--
the
parens
patriae
aspects
of
this
case.
the
complainant's
state
must
show
that
it
has
an
interest
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation
which
is
independent
of
an
--
in
--
in
addition
to
for
whatever
rights
of
its
citizens
maybe
involved.
and,
of
course,
complainant's
state
must
also
show
that
there
is
an
injury
to
the
state
interest,
although
which
there
is
a
judicial
remedy.
if
these
two
tests
are
met,
then
the
complainant's
state
has
standing
to
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
washington
state
stores
also
deal
in
new
york
wine,
the
wine
of
other
states
and
the
wine
of
our
nations.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wallace
howland
in
--
in
order
that
the
court
may
understand
the
interest
that
the
state
has
in
this,
i
should
like,
for
the
next
few
moments,
to
explain
the
rather
extraordinary
situation
or
which
exists
in
the
state
of
washington
and
i
will
deal
directly
--
mr.
wallace
howland
there
are
others,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
may
i
answer
that
this
way,
your
honor,
california
produces
85%
of
all
the
wine
that
is
consumed
in
this
country
including
foreign
wine.
in
the
remaining
15
--
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir.
including
in
the
remaining
15%,
the
non-california
15%,
new
york,
ohio
and
michigan
and
the
state
of
washington
are
the
principal
wine-producing
states.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir,
approximately
that
rate.
mr.
wallace
howland
our
--
our
complaint
of
all
three
broad
types
of
discrimination,
one
of
them
is
the
battle
that
you've
touched
on
and
that
is
that
washington
wine
is
distributed
in
washington
entirely
by
private
enterprise.
mr.
wallace
howland
from
wholesaler,
to
--
from
--
from
winery
to
private
wholesaler,
to
grocery
store,
tavern,
hotel
--
mr.
wallace
howland
you've
can
buy
california
wine,
if
your
grocery
store
has
gone
to
state
liquor
store
and
paid
the
same
retail
price
per
bottle,
as
if
you
went
there
yourself.
then
--
and
there
are
grocery
stores
in
washington,
of
course,
that
do
carry
california
wine
having
purchased
it
already
at
a
consumer
price.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
washington
law
places
no
restriction
--
mr.
wallace
howland
--
on
the
wine
which
a
--
any
of
the
4800
retailers
can
sell.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
complaint
is,
sir,
that
we
cannot
--
that
california
wine
does
not
have
the
same
access
to
these
4800
licensed
retail
out
--
outlets
that
is
freely
accorded
to
washington
wine
and
its
distribution.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
that
it
doesn't
have
the
same
access
to
the
retail
outlet.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir.
california
--
pardon
me.
washington
consumes
about
one
million
--
about
two
million
gallons
of
wine
a
year.
mr.
wallace
howland
they
are
in
precisely
--
mr.
wallace
howland
--
the
same
situation
as
the
california
wine
is,
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
only
distinction
made
in
washington
law
is
between
what
they
called
domestic
wine
which
is
wine
produced
in
the
state
of
washington
from
washington
ground
fruits
and
all
other
wines.
washington
consumes
about
two
million
gallons
a
year
and
about
half
of
it
is
washington
wines
produced
in
that
state.
the
other
half
of
it
comes
from
out
of
the
state.
mr.
wallace
howland
for
all
practical
purposes,
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
there
is
about
2500
gallons
of
certain
types
of
fruit
brandies
that
are
--
that
are
exported,
but
it's
--
it's
miniscule.
of
the
million
gallons
a
year
that
is
lawfully
imported
into
the
state
of
washington,
about
90%
is
california
wine
in
excess
of
900,000
gallons
a
year.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
correct.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
by
california
wine,
i
mean
wine
that
is
produced
in
the
state
of
california
by
private
producers.
the
state
of
california
does
not
manufacture
or
sell
or
deal
in
any
of
these
products
in
any
capacity.
after
this
california
wine
has
been
lawfully
transported
into
washington,
it
is
then
subjected
to
three
principal
types
of
discrimination.
one
is
the
discrimination
of
the
channels
of
distribution
by
which
it
reaches
the
consumer.
the
second
is
discrimination
in
the
state
controls
which
are
exercised
over
the
pricing
of
wine.
and
the
third
is
discrimination
in
the
washington
laws
and
policies
in
connection
with
the
promotion
of
the
sale
of
the
wine
to
retailers,
who
are
authorized
to
sell
it
to
the
public.
at
the
wholesale
level,
washington
has
two
distinct
and
separate
discriminatory
economic
systems,
as
i
call
them,
for
the
distribution
of
wine
and
i
call
them
different
economic
systems.
because
it's
not
only
the
rules
and
the
regulations
which
are
different,
but
under
washington
law
it
is
the
very
nature
of
the
corporate
entities
and
the
business
--
business
establishments
which
are
permitted
to
exist.
this
discrimination
--
this
first
discrimination
has
to
do,
as
i
said,
over
the
channels
of
distribution.
washington
wine,
the
distribution
and
sale
or
marketing
within
that
state
is
entirely
a
function
of
private
enterprise,
from
winery,
to
wholesaler,
to
retailer
to
consumer.
the
state
of
washington
does
not
deal
in
washington
wines
at
any
level
of
its
marketing
or
distribution.
there
are
13
wineries
in
washington.
and
each
one
of
them
is
given
of
a
free
choice
by
washington
law
in
two
respects.
the
washington
winery
can
choose
its
own
channels
of
distribution.
it
may
decide
--
the
winery
may
decide
to
sell
directly
to
the
4800
licensed
retailers,
or
the
washington
winery
may
decide
to
use
the
--
the
services
of
private
wholesalers.
and
through
the
private
wholesalers
have
distribution
made
on
a
statewide
basis.
but
--
mr.
wallace
howland
they
are
prohibited
by
law
from
doing
so,
justice
douglas.
but
since
prior
to
1948,
at
least,
the
state
liquor
stores
have
never
dealt
in
washington
wine.
mr.
wallace
howland
no.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
i
would
not.
mr.
wallace
howland
i
--
i
believe
that
justice
frankfurter
is
almost
paraphrasing
his
own
words
from
the
concurring
opinion
in
frankfurt
distilleries.
i
quite
agree.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
a
direct
function
of
the
washington
statute.
the
washington
statute
provides
expressly
as
follows
and
i
should
like
to
read
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
discrimination
to
which
we
complain
about
is
right
--
there's
apparent
right
on
the
face
of
the
statutes.
all
wines
manufactured
or
produced
in
domestic
wineries,
that
means
washington
wineries,
maybe
sold
by
the
manufacturer
or
producer
thereof,
direct
to
persons
holding
licenses
entitling
them
to
sell
wine
at
retail,
under
the
provisions
of
this
title
or
to
license
domestic
wine
wholesalers
or
to
license
domestic
wineries.
no
wines
except
domestic
wines
shall
be
sold
within
the
state
except
to
the
liquor
control
board
or
by
the
board
or
through
the
state
liquor
stores.
the
exception
for
domestic
wines,
no
wines
except
domestic
wines,
shall
be
sold
within
the
state
except
to
the
state
liquor
control
board.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
if
i
follow
you,
sir,
i
think
it's
a
very
fair
assumption
that
the
pressure
for
this
legislature
and
the
--
the
legislation
that
did
emanate
in
the
washington
wine
industry.
washington
wine
industry
is
trying
to
isolate
california
wine
from
the
lawful
washington
market
where
different
brands
of
washington
wine
are
competing
on
a
private
industry
competitive
business
basis
for
the
trade
--
the
trade
and
custom
of
washington
consumers.
there
are
135
private
wholesalers
of
washington
wine.
there
are
wholesalers
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word.
they
do
not
handle
california
wine
or
any
out-of-state
wine.
the
very
terms
of
their
license
calls
them
a
domestic
wine
wholesaler.
these
are
the
only
private
enterprise
wholesalers
of
wine
in
the
whole
state
of
washington,
135
of
them.
and
the
wineries
--
that
the
washington
wineries
have
a
free
choice
in
selecting
which
of
these
wholesalers
they
want
to
distribute
their
respective
brands
and
trade
names
of
--
of
wine.
these
wholesalers
operate
in
limited
areas
of
the
state.
they
have
a
territorial
franchise
from
the
winery
that
they
represent.
and
all
of
these
wholesalers
have
substantial
sales
organizations.
they
employ
wine
salesman
who
go
out
on
regular
routes
and
contact
the
retail
trade
and
actively
solicit
the
purchase
of
their
washington
wine
and
promote
it
--
promote
its
sale
in
other
ways
which
i
will
also
mention.
then
you
have
the
4800
licensed
retailers,
these
--
these
private
retailers,
i'm
not
speaking
now
about
the
state
liquor
stores.
these
are
envisioned.
there
are
4800
private
businessmen
in
washington,
who
are
licensed
to
sell
wine
at
retail,
some
are
licensed
to
sell
by
the
bottle.
these
would
be
the
grocery
stores,
the
--
the
grocery
stores,
the
supermarkets,
the
hotels
and
there
are
others
license
to
sell
wine
by
the
drink.
these
would
be
the
taverns,
the
bars,
and
some
types
of
licensee,
or
both
types
of
license.
these
4800
retailers
are
solicited
by
salesmen
representing
every
brand
of
washington
wine
that
is
produced
to
please
buy
of
these
brands
of
washington
wine
and
can
i
take
your
order
this
morning.
note
that
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
wine
which
the
4800
retail
licensees
are
authorized
to
sell.
the
retail
licensee
who
is
the
man
dealing
with
the
consuming
public,
can
sell
california
wine,
washington
wine,
new
york
wine,
or
foreign
wine
one,
without
any
restriction
based
upon
its
source
placed
upon
him
or
by
the
state
of
washington.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
discriminations
which
we
complain
are
all
discriminations
that
bear
on
the
wholesale
distribution,
because
after
the
wine
has
reached
the
point
of
the
retailer,
then
so
far
as
the
retailer
is
concerned,
the
state
of
washington
exercises
no
further
control
upon
him.
the
second
type
of
discrimination
involved
in
this
case
is
the
discriminatory
of
policies
and
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
concerning
the
place
of
wine.
concerning
washington
wine,
the
state
exercises
no
control
over
the
level
of
the
prices
at
which
washington
wine
is
sold
at
any
stage
of
its
distribution,
winery,
wholesaler,
retailer.
no
control
over
the
price
of
washington
wine.
there
is
one
requirement
that
is
significant,
washington
law
requires
that
washington
wineries
post
and
specify
a
delivered
price.
a
price
of
washington
wine
delivered
to
the
retailer
and
that
price
must
be
uniform
throughout
the
state.
the
fact
is
that
washington
wine
is
actually
delivered
to
retailers'
establishments
by
the
wholesaler.
the
--
the
salesman
and
the
delivery
people
come
into
the
retail
establishment.
they
service
the
shelves.
they
arrange
the
bottles
of
washington
wine
on
the
retailer
shelf.
they
go
in
the
back
room,
open
up
the
cartons
from
the
stock
and
bring
it
out
and
keep
fresh
and
full
stock
on
the
retailer
shelves.
the
washington
winery
set
the
price
of
their
wine
to
the
retailer
by
their
own
individual
judgment
and
in
the
light
of
the
market
conditions
from
day-to-day
--
or
that
they
find
in
the
competitive
situation
in
which
they
are
brand-for-brand
amongst
the
washington
wines.
and
this
privilege
too,
is
denied
of
the
california
producers
of
wine.
california
producers
or
any
out-of-state
producer
of
wine
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
price
at
which
his
product
shall
be
sold
within
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
wallace
howland
oh,
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
this
is
--
this
is
quite
true,
justice
brennan.
their
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
they
are
legally
entitled
to
bring
their
own
action.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
fact
that
the
washington
state
liquor
control
board
is
the
only
lawful
customer
for
washington
wine
anywhere
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
threat
of
administrative
reprisal
just
about
getting
to
this,
that
so
far
as
california
wine
is
concerned,
the
washington
state
liquor
board
has
non-reviewable
authority.
it
used
its
own
discretion
as
to
what
level
or
on
what
price
it
will
put
on
every
bottle
of
california
wine
with
that
it
--
that
it
imports
and
for
which
--
which
the
state
liquor
board,
of
course,
being
the
only
lawful
outlet
in
the
state
of
washington
for
california
wine.
and
so
you
have
the
--
the
remarkable
situation
that
the
--
the
regulatory
agency
against
whose
regulations
as
you
might
expect
some
form
of
protest,
also
happens
to
be
the
only
lawful
customer
for
your
product
in
the
whole
state.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
would
depend
entirely
upon
the
details
of
the
relief
that
were
obtained
in
--
in
that
kind
of
a
(inaudible)
--
mr.
wallace
howland
well
--
mr.
wallace
howland
it
is
possible.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
possible.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
individual
property
owners
who
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
certainly,
they
could.
certainly
they
could've.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes.
mr.
wallace
howland
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
i
--
i
quite
agree
with
that
because
your
--
in
your
parens
patriae
case,
the
court
has
insisted
that
the
state
must
demonstrate
an
interest
of
its
own.
and,
of
course,
if
the
state
has
an
interest
of
its
own,
it
is
--
it
is
entitled
to
sue.
and
actually
in
the
--
in
the
nuisance
cases
that
you
refer
to,
the
air
pollution
case,
georgia
and
tennessee
cooper
and
the
sewage
cases.
the
causes
of
action
of
the
state
in
those
cases
were
technical
point
of
view.
the
legal
cause
of
action
is
really
the
cause
of
action
of
the
individual
citizens.
we
take
the
cases
where
the
court
has
said
that
the
--
that
the
state
or
the
complaining
state
has
an
interest
in
the
health,
comfort,
and
welfare
of
its
citizens.
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
state
has
no
health.
this
--
you
can't
be
the
health
of
the
--
of
state
government.
state
government
can't
have
health.
state
government
can't
have
comfort.
what
the
cause
of
action
that
is
sued
upon
is
the
injury
to
the
health
of
the
citizens,
the
injury
to
the
comfort
of
the
citizens,
the
interest
--
the
injury
to
the
prosperity
of
the
citizens.
and
what
the
court
has
said
in
those
cases
is
that
the
state
--
the
complainant
state
has
an
interest
of
its
own
in
presenting
or
pursuing
these
derivative
causes
of
action.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
as
i
shall
show,
mr.
justice
black,
the
--
in
this
case
when
i
get
to
the
third
of
these
discriminations,
in
the
matter
of
--
of
the
sales
promotion
program,
the
state
of
california
has
a
--
a
direct
interest
of
its
own.
it
has
certain
official
functions
which
its
law
requires
that
if
it
discharge
and
there
is
no
other
plaintiff
that
is
capable
of
getting
relief
to
the
state
of
california
for
the
injury
to
--
for
the
--
for
the
frustration
of
its
public
policies
for
the
restraints
and
the
restrictions
put
upon
its
employees
and
officials
in
the
pursuit
of
their
--
of
their
duties.
it
might
be
that
the
--
a
private
case,
if
a
private
case
were
brought,
would
in
some
way
result
in
an
injunction
that
would
afford
some
relief
to
a
practical
point
of
view
to
the
state
of
california.
but
this
is
not
securing
redress
to
the
legal
injuries
which
the
state
of
california
itself
had
suffered
and
which
gives
rise
to
a
controversy
between
two
states
of
the
very
type
that
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
was
created
to
determine.
the
--
i've
mentioned
that
the
authority
of
the
washington
state
liquor
control
board
gives
a
complete
discretion
over
the
prices
of
california
wine.
and
the
board
has
only
one
price
and
that
is
a
retail
price
per
bottle
at
which
they
sell
to
all
commerce,
be
they
retailers
purchasing
for
resale,
hotels,
taverns
or
whether
it'd
be
the
individual
consumer.
there
is
no
trade
discount
on
wine.
and
i
think
it
fairly
significant
that
although
washington
law
prohibits
the
trade
discount
on
wine,
washington
law
requires
that
the
board
give
not
less
than
15%
trade
discount
on
distilled
spirits
to
what
are
known
as
class
h
licensees,
which
are
hotels,
restaurants
and
other
bars
of
that
type,
who
sell
mixed
drinks.
but
where
--
where
they
--
they
are
mandated
by
the
statute
to
give
a
15%
discount
to
a
hotel
who
owns
a
bottle
of
whiskey
to
use
for
serving
mixed
drinks,
the
law
forbid
--
forbids
the
state
liquor
board
to
give
any
trade
discount
on
a
bottle
of
wine
to
a
hotel
that
wants
to
sell
and
has
the
authority
to
sell
a
wine
by
the
director.
the
price
levels
which
the
liquor
board
has
set
before
--
for
california
and
other
out-of-state
wines
over
a
long
period
of
time
have
been,
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
arbitrary
and
unreasonably
high.
the
board
has
purchased
california
wine
at
prices
which
is
--
have
resulted
in
a
markup
of
over
100%
at
the
--
taking
into
account
of
this
--
the
--
the
price
at
which
it
was
then
put
on
the
shelves
of
the
retail
stores
for
sale.
the
board
price
is
fob
state
liquor
store.
there
is
no
delivery
service
for
california
wine
from
the
state
store.
the
washington
retailers
who
want
california
wine
must
not
only
pay
cartage
from
the
state
liquor
store,
but
he
has
to
go
to
the
added
inconvenience
of
arranging
for
cartage.
whereas,
as
i've
already
said
in
connection
with
washington
wine,
the
--
the
washington
law
requires
that
the
washington
winery
specify
a
delivered
price
--
a
price
delivered
at
the
retailer's
establishment.
the
net
effects
of
these
pricing
policies
are
simply
this,
that
there
are
two
retail
markups,
not
one,
but
two
retail
markups
on
california
wine.
first
is
the
--
the
markup
of
anywhere
from
68%
to
100%
which
state
liquor
board
puts
on
the
wine
as
it
goes
through
its
store.
and
the
second
is
the
markup
that
anyone
of
the
4800
retail
licensees
must
necessarily
put
under
his
cost,
if
he
wants
to
avoid
selling
at
a
loss
and
if
he
wants
to
even
breakeven
on
his
cost
of
doing
business.
the
retailer
--
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
your
honor,
i
have
not.
may
it
please
the
court.
last
evening
at
the
recess,
i
have
just
completed
my
demonstration
of
the
manner
in
which
washington,
the
state
of
washington
in
a
discriminatory
manner
that
does
everything
possible
to
destroy
the
economic
incentive
of
the
4800
retail
licensees
in
that
state
who
are
authorized
to
sell
at
california
as
well
as
the
wines
of
other
origins.
i
turn
now
to
the
matter
on
which
directly
affects
the
interest
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
cause
of
action
which
the
state
of
california
has
in
its
own
right.
and
this
has
to
do
with
the
discriminations
practiced
by
the
state
of
washington
in
connection
with
sales
promotion
work,
having
to
do,
of
course,
with
the
sale
of
wine.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
define
what
i
mean
by
sales
promotion.
i
am
not
talking
about
advertising.
by
advertising,
i
mean
the
use
of
newspapers
and
other
printed
media,
television,
radio
for
advertising
purposes.
by
sales
promotion,
i
mean
essentially,
personal
contact
work
with
prospective
buyers.
i
mean
the
dissemination
of
product
information
in
such
form
that
it
can
be
used
in
retail
stores.
this
product
information
is
sometimes
known
in
this
trade
as
point
of
sale
material,
graphic
sales
aids,
posters,
displays,
bottle
holders,
racks
for
the
display
of
merchandise.
it
also
--
wine
being
of
the
nature
that
it
is,
it
also
includes
such
things
as
wine
selection
charts,
showing
the
proper
use
or
the
preferred
use
of
various
types
of
wine.
and
it
also
because
wine
is
--
is
used
to
a
large
extent
in
cooking,
it
also
includes
recipe
books
and
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
so
far
as
washington
wine
is
concerned,
the
state
of
washington
places
no
limitation
on
sales
promotion
activity
on
behalf
of
the
sale
of
washington
wine.
but
with
respect
to
california
wine,
again,
washington
law
is
completely
merciless
in
the
flatness
of
its
prohibition
against
sales
promotion
work
on
behalf
of
california
wine.
and
again,
because
this
discrimination
is
so
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
statutes
of
the
state
and
the
regulations
of
the
state
liquor
board,
i
should
like
to
read
a
brief
excerpt.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
the
issue
--
the
--
our
contention,
sir,
is
that
the
state
of
washington
may
not
discriminate
--
mr.
wallace
howland
yes.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
the
--
my
friend,
the
attorney
general
conceives
that
purposes
of
this
argument,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
must
be
taken
to
be
true.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes.
mr.
wallace
howland
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
there
is
any
substantial
dispute
concerning
factual
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
wallace
howland
very
nearly.
mr.
wallace
howland
very
briefly,
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
howland
we're
--
we
rely
on
the
violation
of
commerce
clause,
the
violation
of
the
privilege
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv,
section
2
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
sanction
for
those
violations
to
be
found
in
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
the
--
the
issue
on
that
point
is,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
twenty-first
amendment
simply
has
no
application
to
this
case
because
we
do
not
protest
against
any
regulation
or
other
act
of
the
state
of
washington
having
to
do
with
the
transportation
or
the
importation
of
liquor
into
the
state
of
washington.
and
this,
of
course,
is
the
entire
subject
matter
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
twenty-first
amendment
as
your
honor
knows
says
that
the
transportation
or
importation
of
intoxicating
liquor
into
a
state
in
violation
of
its
laws
is
prohibited.
mr.
wallace
howland
(inaudible)
mr.
wallace
howland
this
is
true.
but
the
discriminations
that
we
complain
of,
sir,
occur
only
after
california
wine
has
been
lawfully
imported
into
washington
by
the
state
liquor
control
board.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
sir
that
is
not
this
case.
if
it
were
this
case,
i
would
take
the
position
that
that
was
not
authorized
by
the
congress
--
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede,
justice
black,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
what
you
say.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes.
mr.
wallace
howland
i'm
quite
sure,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes.
but
fundamentally,
this
will
be
one
of
the
substantive
issues
on
--
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
we
have
referred
to
these
matters
in
our
--
in
our
opening
brief.
but,
so
far
as
the
--
as
the
substantive
law
of
the
case
is
concerned,
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
that
on
the
language
of
the
amendment,
in
the
light
of
the
court's
decisions
to
date,
that
we
have
here
presented
the
court
with
an
open
question
for
which
there
is
no
precedent
to
be
found
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
is
a
question
of
--
of
the
utmost
constitutional
gravity.
as
i
shall
demonstrate
in
a
moment,
it
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
the
state
of
california
and
its
economy.
the
matters
cannot
be
summarily
treated.
mr.
wallace
howland
it
--
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
word,
that
is
correct.
and
when
i
say
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
word,
there
are
a
number
of
related
questions.
it
is
not
just
one
question.
the
--
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
i'm
quite
confident,
sir,
that
that
was
not
the
intendment.
the
intendment
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
as
--
was
nicely
--
it
was
concisely
put
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
to
make
dry
states
dryer
not
wet
states
wetter.
the
intendment
of
--
mr.
wallace
howland
that's
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
describing
the
effect
in
the
intendment
of
--
mr.
wallace
howland
well
--
mr.
wallace
howland
in
this
case,
may
i
say,
the
state
of
california
makes
no
argument
for
any
limitation
on
the
power
of
any
state
to
exclusively
determine
its
own
policy
with
respect
to
liquor,
whether
that
be
a
policy
of
prohibition,
of
partial
prohibition
or
of
no
prohibition.
whatever
policy
a
state
sees
fit
to
make,
we
will
defend
the
right
of
the
states
to
adopt
their
policy
free
from
interference
from
other
states
and
free
from
interference
from
the
federal
government.
the
question
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
very
briefly
is
simply
this,
that
for
60
years,
this
court
was
confronted
by
a
series
of
cases
in
which
it
appeared
that
the
commerce
clause,
what
this
court
has
called
the
immunity
characteristic
of
the
commerce
clause
was
used
to
prevent
dry
states
or
states
that
were
partially
dry
from
preventing
the
influx
of
liquor
from
other
states
into
their
jurisdiction.
it
was
consistently
held
right
down
to
the
--
the
adoption
of
the
webb-kenyon
act
in
1913.
then,
when
the
twenty-first
amendment
came
along,
the
intendment
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
this,
the
intendment
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
to
assist
dry
states
or
states
that
had
a
policy
of
partial
or
total
exclusion
of
liquor
to
aid
them
and
to
make
that
policy
effective.
mr.
wallace
howland
i
would
prefer
to
--
to
state
it
this
way
mr.
justice
black,
the
twenty-first
amendment
did
not
accept
in
its
precise
phraseology,
in
any
way
detract
from
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
the
twenty-first
amendment
had
to
the
peculiar
effect
of
make
it
--
making
it
impossible
for
congress
to
repeal
its
webb-kenyon
act.
the
prohibition
against
congress
in
1913
had
said
that
the
transportation
of
liquor
into
a
state
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
that
state
shall
be
unlawful
it
said
that
in
statute.
the
twenty-first
amendment
elevated
that
to
a
constitutional
status.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
could
be
a
question.
mr.
wallace
howland
no.
it
is
--
it
is
--
mr.
wallace
howland
--
it
is
a
question
in
the
case,
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
(inaudible)
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
but
then
we
have
--
we
have
--
but
that
would
raise
the
further
problem
of
how
far
beyond
those
cases
and
in
what
respect
it
goes
beyond
those
cases.
take
for
example
the
--
it
has
been
said
that
since
the
twenty-first
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause
no
longer
applies
to
liquor
legislation.
well,
this
is
obviously
not
the
law.
mr.
wallace
howland
because
this
court
in
goesaert
against
cleary
debated
and
decided
a
question
in
which
the
sole
issue
was
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
the
--
of
the
fourth
--
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
certain
liquor
regulations
of
the
state
of
michigan.
so
that
if
your
statute
has
to
do
that
with
the
internal
liquor
administration
of
the
state's
laws,
there
is
equal
protection.
mr.
wallace
howland
that's
--
mr.
wallace
howland
not
if
that
were
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis,
no,
sir.
we
honor
the
policies
of
the
dry
states.
there
are
two
bone-dry
states
still
in
this
country.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
but
it's
treating
--
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
--
that
--
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
the
--
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
correct.
mr.
wallace
howland
no
--
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
no.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
it
is
–
it
is
the
most
difficult
and
it
will
require
the
most
extended
treatment.
mr.
wallace
howland
i
prefer
to
--
to
leave
it
on
the
brief.
mr.
wallace
howland
it
has
no
application
to
this
case.
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
date
of
the
four
cases,
young's
market,
the
triner
case,
the
retaliation
cases,
all
have
to
do
with
state
laws
that
directly
regulated
or
prohibited
the
importation
of
liquor.
now,
in
this
case,
we
don't
even
refer
in
our
complaint.
mr.
wallace
howland
--
through
the
washington
statute,
that
makes
the
washington
state
liquor
board
the
only
lawful
transporter
or
importer
of
liquor
into
that
state.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
is
my
position.
yes,
sir.
the
washington
wineries,
if
i
may
return
to
the
matter
of
the
sales
promotion
program,
the
washington
wineries
not
only
promote
the
sale
of
their
own
respective
brands
of
washington
wine,
they
also
do
institutional
promotion.
and
by
institutional
promotions,
i
mean,
promoting
the
sale
of
washington
wine
generically,
without
respect
to
any
particular
brand
or
trade
name.
and
the
promotion
work
that
is
in
fact
done
in
the
state
of
washington,
is
done
at
the
wholesale
level
through
the
135
private
wholesalers
of
washington
wine.
this
actually
is
the
only
efficient
way
to
conduct
this
type
on
operation.
there
are
only
a
135
wholesalers
as
against
4800
retailers.
and
the
key
to
this
type
of
promotional
work,
of
course,
is
the
manpower
of
the
wholesaler's
organizations,
the
personal
and
frequent
contacts
which
the
salesmen
have
are
with
the
retailers.
and
it's
the
economic
existence
of
these
washington
retailers
that
makes
possible
the
kind
of
sales
promotion
that
washington
does.
now,
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
an
activity
that
the
state
of
california
through
its
own
official
agencies
has
been
carrying
on
for
20
years.
to
date,
the
state
has
spent
about
$25,000,000
in
this
activity
and
its
current
activity
is
at
the
rate
of
about
$2,700,000
a
year.
california
maintains
representatives
all
over
the
united
states,
19
of
them
outside
the
state
of
california.
we
have
an
office
in
new
york
city,
one
in
chicago
and
in
this
promotion
work,
the
state
devices
promotional
programs
to
use
a
commercial
term.
these
are
--
these
are
very
frequently
seasonal
in
their
nature.
the
state
has
a
contract
with
--
with
the
advertising
agency.
and
these
graphic
sales
aids,
posters,
colored
photographs,
store
displays
and
so
forth
are
all
designed
for
a
particular
promotion.
when
one
of
these
comes
on,
the
state
representatives
contact
every
wholesaler
in
their
area.
they
instruct
the
wholesaler's
salesmen
in
the
use
of
this
particular
promotional
material
and
the
wholesaler's
salesmen
then
in
the
--
their
routine
contact
with
the
retailers
take
this
material
around,
distribute
it,
set
it
up
in
the
stores
and
so
on.
this
is
exactly
what
washington
wineries
do
in
the
state
of
washington.
this
is
exactly
what
the
state
of
california
does
all
over
the
united
states
except
in
washington.
and
the
reason
we
cannot
do
it
in
washington
is,
of
course,
the
practical
effect
of
these
washington
statutes
which
i
have
referred
to
yesterday.
it
is
this
projection
of
the
official
functions
of
california
beyond
its
borders.
this
actual
interstate
activity
or
interstate
intercourse
in
which
california
is
engaged,
is
what
gives
california
undeniable
standing
to
sue
in
this
case.
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
washington,
the
point
is
made
that
while
this
activity
is
conducted
actually
by
an
agency
of
the
state
of
california,
that
actually
a
--
the
washington
position
is
that
it
is
on
behalf
of
--
of
the
--
the
california
wine
industry.
and
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
this
point
for
a
moment
because
that
is
not
true.
the
california
sales
promotion
program
is
exclusively
in
aid
of
the
state's
own
statewide
policy.
mr.
wallace
howland
that's
just
about
what
i
was
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
howland
well,
i
--
i
was
about
to
differentiate
the
difference
between
the
state's
own
interest
and
the
obvious
benefits
from
the
state
program,
which
in
your
--
to
the
wine
industry.
no
one,
it
would
be
silly
to
deny
that
the
wine
industry
benefits
from
this
activity
of
the
state.
but
the
state's
motivation
is
not
simply
to
help
a
few
private
businessmen.
the
state's
motivation
principally,
is
to
protect
its
own
unique
agricultural
structure.
agriculture
is
not
only
the
biggest
business
in
california.
it
is
peculiarly
dependent
upon
free
access
to
the
markets
of
the
country.
i
think
that
there
is
no
state
in
the
united
states
that
is
so
peculiarly
dependent
for
--
for
at
least
in
the
food
stuffs
in
the
kind
of
agricultural
products
that
is
directly
consumed
by
humans.
there
is
no
state
comparable
to
california
in
its
dependence
upon
free
markets.
california
produces
a
third
of
all
the
commercial
fruits,
a
quarter
of
all
the
commercial
vegetables.
it's
quite
true
that
in
recent
months,
we
in
california,
as
well
as
our
friends
in
texas
have
had
to
take
the
back
seat,
statistically,
so
far
as
the
size
of
a
state
is
concerned.
alaska
has
got
us
both
(inaudible)
but
so
far
as
the
question
of
the
disposal
of
our
agricultural
surpluses
are
concerned,
california
yields
to
no
state,
when
we
have
90%
of
all
the
peaches
that
are
produced
in
this
country,
90%
of
all
the
carloads
of
lettuce
that
are
shipped
commercially.
mr.
wallace
howland
we
have
under
our
marketing
act
a
program
for
peaches.
there
have
--
have
been
at
times
programs
concerning
lettuce.
and
i
--
i
cannot
answer
your
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
lettuce
program
in
effect
at
the
moment.
but
under
this
statute
--
mr.
wallace
howland
that's
on
the
wine
promotion
program.
mr.
wallace
howland
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
raised
by
a
special
excise
tax
on
wine
which
is
readied
for
market,
under
the
--
mr.
wallace
howland
the
industry
itself
is
the
source
of
the
money.
but
this
is
true
in
a
great
deal
of
--
of
state
government
activities
in
california.
mr.
wallace
howland
sir?
mr.
wallace
howland
for
highway
taxes.
mr.
wallace
howland
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
--
the
decisions
of
the
--
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court,
that
say
that
in
parens
patriae
action
that
the
injury
must
be
of
great
magnitude.
there
may
be
some
question
arise
to
some
of
the
lesser
industries
where
if
--
that
whether
or
not
that
would
be
true.
in
this
case,
it
is
not
a
question
because
of
all
the
products
that
california
raises,
grapes
are
the
largest
and
most
valuable
single
crop
produced
for
human
consumption.
mr.
wallace
howland
in
a
--
in
a
--
mr.
wallace
howland
in
a
free
economy,
that
--
that's
impossible
to
predict.
mr.
wallace
howland
roughly,
45%.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
california
wine
sold
in
washington
at
the
present
time
is
worth
about
$2,500,000
at
the
winery
level.
mr.
wallace
howland
or
it
would
go
--
mr.
wallace
howland
statistically,
we
have
shown
in
our
complaints,
sir,
that
the
traffic
in
wine
in
the
state
of
washington
has
actually
been
curtailed
as
a
result
of
these
discriminations.
based
upon
the
--
the
experience
in
the
other
monopoly
states
where
there
is
no
discrimination,
the
amount
will
be
considerably
more
than
--
than
the
figures
you
mentioned
would
indicate.
mr.
wallace
howland
sir?
mr.
wallace
howland
no.
mr.
wallace
howland
no.
mr.
wallace
howland
no.
mr.
wallace
howland
there's
--
there's
a
--
mr.
wallace
howland
--
a
wide
--
wide
variation
there.
but
i
would
like
to
close
with
--
with
a
--
a
reference
to
a
point
that
was
brought
up
yesterday.
and
that
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
a
hypothetical
question,
of
whether
or
not
if
a
suit
were
brought
by
a
different
plaintiff,
on
a
different
cause
of
action,
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
there
would
be
some
relief
to
the
state
of
california.
this
is
a
legal
possibility.
anything
is
possible.
the
practical
point
of
view,
it
is
most
unlikely,
and
i
should
like
to
briefly
say
why.
in
all
of
the
court's
prior
decisions
dealing
with
its
original
jurisdiction,
the
question
has
not
been,
“can
this
plaintiff
get
relief
at
the
instance
of
suit
by
another
plaintiff?”
the
question
before
that
this
court
has
previously
considered
was
whether
or
not
there
was
an
alternative
for
a
different
trial
court
for
this
particular
plaintiff
to
take
his
cause
of
action
to.
there
are
a
great
many
situations
in
the
law
where
an
injury,
a
fact,
results
in
common
injury
to
many
and
simply
because
one
injured
party
doesn't
or
hasn't
sued,
has
never
been
considered
to
be
a
reason
why
an
--
the
--
another
injured
party
could
not
sue
on
his
own
cause
of
action.
mr.
wallace
howland
no,
sir.
we
are
barred
by
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
wallace
howland
from
bringing
this
cause
in
the
district
court.
this
is
section
1251
(a)
(1)
of
title
28,
which
states
that
in
controversies
between
two
or
more
states
--
mr.
wallace
howland
--
the
--
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
exclusive.
mr.
wallace
howland
there
is
a
serious
question,
justice
brennan,
in
my
mind
--
mr.
wallace
howland
--
as
to
--
mr.
wallace
howland
there's
no
private
litigation
in
this
field
pending.
mr.
wallace
howland
in
any
court.
mr.
wallace
howland
i'm
not
familiar
--
mr.
wallace
howland
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
point
--
the
point
i
--
i
should
like
to
make
is
that
there
--
there
--
that
a
california
wine
producer
seeking
to
bring
that
action
against
the
state
of
washington
has
really
got
problems.
if
he
is
a
california
wine
producer,
whose
wine
is
now
being
sold
in
washington,
having
disposed
of
his
complete
right,
title
and
interest
when
he
sells
that
wine
to
the
washington
state
liquor
board,
does
he
have
any
standing
to
sue
as
to
what
the
state
liquor
board
does
with
that
wine
after
he
has
voluntarily
committed
it
to
them?
if
the
california
winery
was
one
of
the
many
who
does
not
have
any
of
its
wine
sold
in
the
state
of
washington,
then
on
what
can
it
complain?
in
what
respect
has
it
been
injured?
i
simply
suggest
that
there
are
greater
problems
here
in
formulating
a
suit
by
a
private
litigant.
mr.
wallace
howland
this
is
the
--
mr.
wallace
howland
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
disputed
question
of
fact
in
this
case.
i
think
that
this
case
if
it
couldn't
be
submitted
on
the
pleadings
that
we
would
be
able
to
stipulate
with
our
friends
from
washington
upon
facts.
and
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case,
georgia
against
pennsylvania
railroad,
where
in
the
dissenting
opinion
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
reason
why
this
court
is
concerned
about
its
original
jurisdiction,
and
the
reason
why
a
court
looks
at
the
possibility
of
an
alternative
forum
is
because
of
the
relatively
heavy
demands
upon
the
time
of
this
court
in
cases
where
it
must
evaluate
the
evidence
even
if
it's
been
referred
out
to
(inaudible)
and
i
simply
suggest
that
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
substantial
issue
of
fact
that
that
reason
or
--
or
that
line
of
reason
has
no
application.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
not
in
all
circumstances.
mr.
wallace
howland
in
--
well,
in
this
–
in
this
case,
it
can
be
drawn
on
the
basis
of
the
--
this
extraordinary
thing
in
the
american
economy
of
a
state
through
its
own
official
agencies
going
out
and
itself
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
with
its
activities
being
intermeshed
and
intertwined
with
those
of
private
industry.
so
that
in
this
case,
we
actually
have
the
state's
own
cause
of
action.
now,
this
does
not
occur
very
often.
mr.
wallace
howland
certainly.
and
this
--
this
court
has
more
than
once
rejected
the
--
the
task
of
trying
to
definitively
define
its
original
jurisdiction.
there
could
be
other
cases.
but
i
say
that
--
that
this
is
not
opening
up
pandora's
box
because
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
court
that
the
case
with
the
state's
own
cause
of
action
built
into
it,
that
we
have
here,
has
never
been
submitted.
the
--
that
is
where
this
case
differs
from
the
parens
patriae
cases.
this
is
a
parens
patriae
case
but
we
also
have
the
state
of
california
being
denied
its
own
constitutional
rights
because
of
the
effect
of
the
washington
statutes,
the
washington
discriminatory
system
upon
the
state's
trade
promotion
program.
and
this
--
this
is
a
fact
in
this
case.
it's
a
situation
of
that
--
well,
i
can
say
that
it's
never
been
presented
to
the
court
before.
mr.
wallace
howland
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
many
--
many,
in
fact,
most
of
our
marketing
orders
have
nothing
to
do
with
sales
promotion
programs.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
--
the
state
does
not
have
the
extraterritorial
activity.
the
state
does
not
inject
itself
into
interstate
commerce
in
the
types
of
marketing
order
that
are
concerned
with
other
things
than
trade
promotion.
mr.
wallace
howland
the
--
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
the
state
of
california
could
promote
the
sale
of
california
peaches
--
mr.
wallace
howland
(voice
overlap)
statute
but
we
don't.
mr.
wallace
howland
if
we
didn't
have
the
program,
we
would
then
be
here
in
the
same
situation
of
the
state
of
georgia
was
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case.
mr.
wallace
howland
there's
got
to
be
a
straight
--
a
straight
parens
patriae
type
of
situation.
mr.
wallace
howland
and
i
think
you
would
properly
be
here
because
of
the
importance
of
this
industry
to
the
economy
of
the
state,
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
howland
but
--
but
we
have
a
stronger
case
for
this
--
mr.
wallace
howland
--
because
--
mr.
wallace
howland
the
--
the
--
there
is
a
raisin
--
you
mean
the
state's
--
mr.
wallace
howland
you
mean
the
prorate
case?
mr.
wallace
howland
there
is
direct
similarity
in
the
operation
of
--
within
california.
