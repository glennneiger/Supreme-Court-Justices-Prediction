mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
california
has
stated
the
cause
of
action.
this
assumes
that
somehow,
the
court
has
determined
there
is
original
jurisdiction,
so
far
as
their
capacity
is
concerned.
it
is
our
position
she
has
not
stated
the
cause
of
action.
now,
of
course,
the
complaint
of
the
state
of
california
is
that
the
particular
statutes
and
regulations,
restricting
her
wine
in
our
state,
violate
two
constitutional
provisions,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv,
section
2
and
the
commerce
clause.
if
i
may
first
briefly
address
myself
to
the
first
of
these
points
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
so
as
far
as
we
can
see,
this
clause
is
--
or
provision
is
simply
not
available
to
the
state
of
california.
as
your
honors
know,
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibits
all
suits
against
the
state
by
or
for
citizens
of
other
states,
new
hampshire
versus
louisiana.
therefore,
california
has
been
put
in
a
position
of
bringing
this
action
in
a
quasi-sovereign
capacity.
now,
this
is
important
and
material
to
the
question
of
privileges
and
immunities
because
we
have
to
examine
the
capacity
in
which
california
brings
this
suit
to
see
if
it's
a
person
or
a
citizen
within
the
protection
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
what
is
the
capacity,
that
of
california?
she
has
likened
her
capacity
to
that
of
georgia.
in
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper
company
where
--
mr.
justice
holmes
described
it,
in
that
capacity
the
state
has
an
interest
independent
of
and
behind
the
title
of
its
citizens
in
all
the
air,
earth
and
within
its
domain.
and
again
and
again,
the
court
has
defined
this
quasi-sovereign
interest
as
being
an
interest
apart
from
that
of
the
individual's
concern.
so
clearly,
california,
as
a
sovereign
state,
is
bringing
this
as
a
state,
not
as
a
group
of
citizens.
now,
accordingly,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
not
applicable
to
this
suit.
it
is
a
protection
afforded
only
natural
persons.
i
think
an
interesting
case
in
this
regard
is
bank
of
augusta
versus
earle.
there,
the
bank
of
georgia
corporation
was
seeking
to
sustain
its
right
to
exercise
corporate
powers
in
another
state,
namely
alabama.
and
that
right
to
exercise
these
corporate
powers
outside
its
own
state
was
challenged.
it
invoked
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
and
it
was
there
held
--
well
first,
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
bank
was
that
if
all
it's
members
of
the
corporation
were
rather
than
of
georgia
and
they
were
within
the
protection
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
then
the
corporation
should
be,
too.
that
was
rejected
and
it
was
held
there
that
the
corporation,
not
being
a
natural
person
was
not
within
the
protection
of
the
clause.
and
excellent
discussion
of
the
nature
of
the
clause
is
contained
against
paul
versus
virginia,
decided
in
1868
where
the
court
said,
“the
term
citizens
as
used
applies
only
to
natural
persons,
members
of
the
body
politic
owing
allegiance
to
the
state,
not
to
artificial
persons
created
by
the
legislature
possessing
only
the
attribute
--
attributes
which
the
legislature
has
prescribed.”
in
blake
against
mcclung,
a
case
involving
an
insolvency
statute
where
residents
of
the
state
were
preferred
over
non-residents.
the
court
held
that
it
--
there
was
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
with
respect
to
natural
persons
residing
out
of
tennessee
but
the
foreign
corporation
could
not
avail
itself
of
that
provision.
accordingly,
it
would
seem
that
through
this
clear
line
of
authority,
california,
not
being
a
natural
person,
may
not
invoke
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
and
on
authority
of
hill
versus
district
of
columbia
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
we
would
suggest
that
she
cannot
invoke
it,
invoke
this
provision
since
she
is
not
within
the
class
of
persons
with
respect
to
whom
the
alleged
acts
of
washington
are
unconstitutional.
now,
i
will
discuss
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
wish
only
to
add
before
leaving
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
that
what
i
shall
say
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause,
applies
equally
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
namely
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
taken
the
restrictive
and
regulatory
acts
of
a
state
with
respect
to
imported
liquor
outside
these
provisions
of
the
constitution.
now,
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause,
it
is
said
that
not
only
is
our
legislation
and
regulations
a
burden
but
it
is
discriminatory
with
respect
to
california
wine
which
squarely
presents
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
in
it's
brief,
and
as
i
understand
it
today,
california
has
contended
that
the
true
meaning
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
still
in
doubt.
suggested
that
what
courts
--
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
with
respect
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
mostly
dicta.
it
implied
that
this
court
has
never
adequately
considered
the
twenty-first
amendment
or
it's
economic
significance.
well,
this
is
certainly
not
so.
the
amendment
has
been
carefully
and
fully
considered
by
this
court.
the
arguments
of
california
in
this
case,
as
many
of
your
honors
know,
are
mere
repetitions
of
ones
that
have
been
made
many
times
before.
in
the
course
of
its
brief,
california
has
contended,
as
i
understand
its
contentions,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
should
apply
only
to
imports
into
dry
states.
that
the
amendment
prohibits
imports
of
liquor
into
a
state
only
when,
in
violation
of
proper
or
reasonable
state
laws,
rather
than
state
laws,
as
the
amendment
reads.
that
finally,
that
somehow
the
webb-kenyon
act
was
overlooked
by
this
court
when
it
first
construed
the
twenty-first
amendment.
now,
i
find
the
complete
answer
to
all
of
these
contentions
in
the
state
border
of
equalization
of
california
versus
young's
market
company.
therein,
justice
brandeis
did
a
remarkable
thing
in
that
he
set
up
each
of
these
contentions
in
concise
language
and
answered
each
in
concise,
clear,
understandable
language.
i
can't
improve
on
his
language
and
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
some
of
it
because
it
is
so
completely
applicable
to
this
case.
there,
the
court
held
--
what
the
plaintiff's
complaint
of
is
the
refusal
to
let
them
import
beer.
now,
of
course,
this
case
involved
a
license
fee
for
the
privilege
of
importing
beer
into
the
state
of
california.
it
squarely
presented
the
meaning
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
the
court.
the
court
held,
what
the
plaintiff's
complaint
of
is
the
refusal
to
let
them
import
beer
without
paying
for
the
privilege
of
importation.
prior
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
it
would
obviously
been
unconstitutional
to
impose
a
fee
for
that
privilege.
the
position
would
have
been
--
would
have
been
void,
not
because
it
resulted
in
discrimination
but
--
but
because
that
he
was
a
direct
burden
on
commerce.
the
amendment
which
prohibited
the
transportation
or
importation
of
intoxicating
liquors
into
any
state
in
violation
of
the
laws
,thereof,
abrogated
the
right
to
import
free,
so
far
as
concerns
intoxicating
liquor.
now,
justice
brandeis
gave
the
basic
construction
to
the
amendment.
he
said,
“the
words
used
are
apt
to
confer
upon
the
state
the
power
to
forbid
all
importations
which
do
not
comply
with
the
conditions
which
it
prescribes.”
i
think
the
word,
“conditions”
are
important.
then,
he
analyzed
the
contentions
of
the
plaintiff.
he
said
the
plaintiffs
asked
us
to
limit
this
broad
command.
they
request
us
to
construe
the
amendment,
they're
saying
in
effect,
the
state
may
prohibit
the
importation
of
liquors,
providing
it
prohibits
the
manufacture
and
stay
within
its
borders.
that's
one
of
the
contentions
that
i
understand,
of
california.
it
only
applies
to
the
dry
states.
but
if
it
permits
such
manufacture
and
sale,
then
it
must
compete
on
equal
terms
with
the
domestic
intoxicants.
to
say
this
would
involve
not
a
construction
of
the
amendment
but
a
rewriting
of
it.
then
he
answers
the
question
that
the
--
the
contention
that
the
state
regulation
must
be
reasonable.
plaintiff
argued
that,
despite
the
amendment,
the
state
may
not
regulate
importations
except
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public
health,
safety
or
morals.
the
importer's
license
fee
was
not
imposed
to
that
end.
same
contention
that
california
has
made
here.
surely,
the
state
may
adopt
the
lesser
degree
of
regulations
said
justice
brandeis,
than
total
prohibition.
can
it
be
doubted
that
a
state
might
establish
a
state
monopoly
of
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
beer
and
either
prohibit
all
competing
importations
or
discourage
importation
by
levying
a
heavy
impost
or
channelize
desired
importations
by
confining
them
to
a
single
consignee.
and
in
that
last
language,
of
course,
he
identified
the
practices
of
the
state
of
washington
in
confining
our
imports
to
the
single
consignee,
of
namely,
the
state
liquor
board.
then
with
respect
to
the
charge
that
the
court
had
overlooked
the
webb-kenyon
act,
justice
brandeis
said,
“as
we
think
the
language
of
the
amendment
is
clear,
we
do
not
discuss
these
matters.”
referring
to
the
prior
interpretations
given
the
webb-kenyon
act
which
being
an
act
of
congress,
was
not
subject
to
the
same
rules
of
construction
as
the
constitutional
amendment.
he
said,
the
claim
that
the
statutory
provisions
and
the
regulations
are
void
under
the
equal
protection
clause
may
be
briefly
disposed
of,
classification
recognized
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
cannot
be
deemed
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth.
well,
since
this
case,
young's
market
case,
involved
and
required
the
construction
of
the
meaning
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
it
did
not
constitute
dicta,
merely
because
the
principles
announced
in
construing
this
amendment
governed
other
fact
patterns
certainly
does
not
mean
that
it
was
dicta.
these
determinations
were
given
in
response
to
contentions
made
in
the
case
and
were
necessary
to
the
case.
and
the
principles
laid
down
there
by
justice
brandeis
are
the
law
and
not
dicta.
now,
california
in
the
face
of
young's
market
case
says
our
case
is
different
in
that
it
involved
discrimination
whereas
young's
market
case
did
not.
but
california
has,
in
this
respect,
overlooked
indianapolis
brewing
company
versus
the
liquor
control
commission.
that
case
involved
a
michigan
act
which
prohibited
local
dealers
from
selling
beer
manufactured
in
another
state
that
discriminated
against
michigan.
this
was
clearly
a
discrimination
type
law
and
the
very
worst
type
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause.
it
was
a
clear
burden
and
a
discrimination
on
interstate
commerce.
it
was
contended
that
it
did
violate
the
commerce
clause,
the
due
process
clause,
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
held
for
whatever
its
character,
the
law
is
valid.
since
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
held
in
the
young's
market
company
case,
the
right
of
a
state
to
prohibit
or
regulate
the
importation
of
intoxicating
liquor
is
not
limited
by
the
commerce
clause.
another
clear
case
of
discrimination
was
that
involved
in
joseph
s.
finch
and
co.
versus
mckittrick,
also
decided
in
1939
by
district
justice
brandeis,
involving
the
michigan's
and
missouri's
statute,
which
is
similar
to
the
other
--
at
which
i
described
prohibited
imports
from
states
that
discriminated
against
missouri.
again,
it
was
attacked
on
the
basis
of
violating
the
commerce
clause
and
the
several
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
said,
“the
claim
for
the
unconstitutionality
has
rested
in
this
court,
substantially
on
the
contention
that
the
statute
violates
the
commerce
clause.”
it's
urged
that
the
missouri
law
does
not
relate
to
the
protection
of
health,
safety,
and
morality
or
the
promotion
of
their
social
welfare,
but
it
is
merely
an
economic
weapon
of
retaliation.
and
hence,
the
twenty-first
amendment
should
not
be
interpreted
as
granting
power
to
enact
it.”
since
that
amendment,
the
right
of
a
state
to
prohibit
or
regulate
the
importation
of
intoxicating
liquor
is
not
limited
by
the
commerce
clause,
and
it
was
citing
young's
market
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
a
noble
contention
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
by
the
state
of
california.
of
course,
as
your
honor
will
readily
apprehend,
the
language
and
the
scope
of
the
language
as
it
has
referred
to
the
commerce
clause
and
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
can
--
is
indistinguishable
from
its
operations
upon
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
and
that
is
our
second
contention
with
respect
to
that
clause
which
you
cannot
distinguish
the
protection
of
that
privileges
and
immunities
clause
over
the
protection
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
these
purposes.
and
the
case
in
point,
which
particularly
discussed
the
matter
of
the
equal
protection
clause
is
mahoney
versus
joseph
triner
corporation
decided
in
1938,
again,
by
justice
brandeis.
in
that
case,
the
state
of
minnesota
passed
a
clearly
discriminatory
law
which
prevented
the
--
the
sale
of
liquor
in
minnesota
if
it
contained
more
than
25%
alcohol,
unless
it
would
register
with
the
patent
office.
the
particular
economic
purpose
of
the
status
at
the
time,
but
it
obviously
had
no
relationship
to
any
police
power
purpose.
it
was
challenged
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
held
the
statute
clearly
discriminates
in
favor
of
liquor
process
within
the
state
as
against
liquor
process
(inaudible)
but
only
the
locally
processed
may
be
sold
regardless
of
whether
the
brand
has
been
registered,
that
under
the
amendment,
discrimination
against
imported
liquor
is
permissible,
although
it
is
not
an
incident
of
reasonable
regulation
of
the
liquor
traffic,
was
settled
by
state
board
of
equalization
versus
young's
market
case.
now,
california
has
made
another
contention
in
its
reply
brief
which
i
feel
must
answered.
and
that
is
that,
and
again,
in
the
argument
today,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
applies
only
to
incidents
of
regulations
at
the
border
apparently,
at
the
importation.
so
--
as
soon
as
that
liquor
is
within
the
state,
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
no
longer
applicable.
well,
first
of
all,
let
us
understand
the
operation
of
the
washington
statutes
as
set
out.
it
does
prohibit
the
importation
of
wine
into
the
state
of
washington,
except
that
purchased
by
the
liquor
board.
the
wine
purchased
by
the
state
liquor
control
board
is
purchased
pursuant
to
statutes,
which
governs
its
sale
and
distribution
and
so
forth
inside
the
state
of
washington.
and
that
is
the
condition
upon
which
any
california
wine
comes
into
the
state.
and
it
is
a
condition
which
is
rightfully
imposed
by
the
state
of
washington
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
now,
this
court,
i
am
sure,
has
never
understood
the
operation
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
apply
only
to
the
act
of
importation,
but
ceasing
to
have
effect
after
the
liquor
became
--
came
inside
the
territory
of
the
state.
the
understanding
of
mr.
justice
black
is
set
out
in
united
states
versus
frankfort
distilleries,
decided
in
1945.
this
case,
you
may
recall,
involved
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
against
price
conspiracy
by
liquor
companies.
it
was
contended
by
the
defendants
that
since
the
sherman
act
derived
its
power
from
the
commerce
clause,
the
commerce
clause
no
longer
operated
with
respect
to
liquor
that
they
had
a
defense.
and,
of
course,
the
court
decided
that
that
was
true
only
if
the
states
had
indicated
they
approved
of
the
price
regulation.
but
for
our
purposes
here,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
twenty-first
amendment
applies
to
the
control
of
liquor
within
a
state,
mr.
justice
black
said,
it
is
argued,
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
the
constitution
bars
its
prosecution.
that
amendment
bestowed
upon
the
states
broad
regulatory
power
over
the
liquor
traffic
within
their
territories.
it
has
not
given
the
states
plenary
and
exclusive
power
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
persons
doing
an
interstate
liquor
business
outside
their
boundaries.
granting
the
states
--
this
is
the
important
language,
granting
the
state's
full
authority
to
determine
the
conditions
upon
which
liquor
can
come
into
its
territory
and
what
will
be
done
with
it
after
it
gets
there,
it
does
not
follow
from
this
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
without
power
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
those
engaged
in
interstate
trade
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
colorado.
and,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
indicated
his
understanding
in
this
respect,
if
a
state,
for
its
own
sufficient
reasons,
deems
that
the
desirable
policy
to
standardize
the
price
of
liquor
within
its
borders,
either
by
direct
price
fixing
statute
or
by
permissive
sanction,
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
it
the
power
and
the
commerce
clause
as
not
being
said.
the
understanding
being
that
this
applied
equally
to
regulation
within
the
state
after
the
liquor
had
arrived
as
well
as
the
act
of
importation.
and
i
think
the
case
of
ziffrin
versus
reeves,
decided
in
1939,
wherein
the
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
held
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
actually
freed
the
states
of
restrictions
on
the
export
of
liquor
as
well
as
the
import,
again,
an
activity
that
was
commencing
within
the
state.
there
is
no
basis,
of
course,
for
the
proposition
that
it
must
--
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
applies
only
to
the
act
of
passing
the
liquor
across
the
border.
it
does
apply,
of
course,
with
respect
to
regulations
within
the
border.
now,
the
interpretation
placed
upon
the
twenty-first
amendment
by
this
court
has
been
criticized
by
some
as
being
unrealistic,
permitting
trade
discrimination
and
yet,
it's
been
praised
by
many,
too.
and
certainly,
there
are
very
sound
policy
reasons
as
well
as
simply
interpreting
the
amendment
as
it
was
written
or
interpreting
it
as
it
has
been.
those
are
contained
in
carter
versus
virginia
and
had
been
written
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
frankfurter.
i
see
it
had
(inaudible)
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
i
--
i
might
comment
on
those.
we
have
conflicting
quotations
in
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant's
briefs.
one
statement
by
senator
blaine
indicated
that
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
i
have
--
insofar
as
the
plaintiff's
brief
is
concerned,
i
believe
it's
page
47,
the
yellow
one.
yes,
page
48.
senator
blaine
was
quoted
as
saying
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
i
believe
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee,
my
recollection
is,
your
honor.
his
language
was
--
i
thought
his
language
is
quoted
in
the
plaintiff's
brief.
in
any
case,
there
is
some
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
--
language
which
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
oh,
yes.
they
said
to
ensure
this
so
called
dry
states
against
the
importation
of
intoxicating
liquors
into
those
states,
the
language
which
has
been
quoted
in
the
law
review
articles.
then
he
also
said,
which
we
have
quoted
on
page
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
well,
that
is
true.
that
--
that's
sort
of
an
a
fortiori
situation.
that
is
included
within
the
greater
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
--
our
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
none.
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
flatly,
none.
we
--
we
thought
we
would
counter
their
language,
perhaps
that
was
superfluous.
but
of
course,
the
language
of
a
senator
with
respect
to
a
constitutional
amendment
has
no
bearing,
whatsoever,
upon
its
construction.
mr.
thomas
r.
garlington
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
justice
frankfurter
more
or
less
disposed
of
the
point
with
his
question.
well,
certainly
the
interpretation,
by
this
court,
of
the
twenty
first
amendment
is
reasonable.
and
it
stemmed
from
a
history
of
very
great
difficulty
in
trying
to
adjust
the
extensive
and
admitted
police
powers
of
a
state
in
regulating
liquor
with
the
commerce
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
so
this
language
is
asked
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
carter
versus
virginia.
it
is
now
suggested
that
a
state
must
keep
within
the
limits
of
reasonable
necessity
and
this
court
must
judge
whether
or
not
virginia
has
adopted
regulations
reasonably
necessary
to
enforce
its
local
liquor
laws.
such
canons
of
adjudication
open
wide
the
door
of
conflict
and
confusion,
which
have
in
the
past
characterized
the
liquor
controversies
in
this
court
and
in
no
small
measure
form
part
of
the
unedifying
history
which
led
first
to
the
eighteenth
and
then
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
less
than
six
years
ago,
this
court
rejected
the
impossible
task
of
deciding
instead
of
leaving
it
for
legislatures
to
decide
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
regulation
of
the
liquor
traffic.
the
issue
was
fairly
presented
in
mahoney-triner
corporation,
and
that
was
the
holding.
therefore,
the
state
of
washington
first,
because
california
has
not
demonstrated
a
capacity
to
maintain
this
action,
secondly,
because
she
has
not
stated
the
cause
of
action
in
view
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
respectfully
ask
this
court
that
her
--
her
petition
to
file
her
original
complaint
be
denied.
