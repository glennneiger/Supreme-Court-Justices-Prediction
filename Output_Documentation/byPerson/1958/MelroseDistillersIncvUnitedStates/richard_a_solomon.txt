mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
antitrust
action
under
section
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
in
which
a
large
number
of
corporations
and
their
subsidiaries
and
substantial
number
of
individual
were
indicted
for
conspiracy
to
fix
prices
and
for
attempting
to
monopoly.
and
all
of
the
corporations
and
all
of
the
defendants,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
pleaded
nolo
contendere
and
fines
have
been
imposed.
the
question
here
relates
to
three
of
the
corporations.
one
of
which
is
the
delaware
corporation,
the
other
of
which
--
other
two
of
which
are
maryland
corporations.
who
after
the
indictment
were
dissolved
and
their
functions
were
taken
over
by
other
aspects
of
their
parent
corporation.
now,
the
court
below
decided
this
matter
by
a
construction
of
the
delaware
and
maryland
law.
and
they
looked
into
the
problem
that
judge
marks
discussed
with
you
here
today
as
to
whether
under
this
relevant
state
law,
the
law
provided
for
the
continuance
on
of
criminal
prosecutions
which
had
been
brought
prior
to
dissolution
after
the
dissolution.
and
the
court
below,
for
reasons
which
we
think
are
correct
and
which
i'll
go
into
briefly,
decided
that
under
the
delaware
and
maryland
laws,
these
criminal
prosecutions
which
had
been
began
prior
to
dissolution
did
continue.
but
we
do
not
think,
if
it
will
please
the
court,
that
it
is
necessary
or
even
advisable
to
rest
the
decision
on
these
grounds.
because
as
we
shall
argue
in
our
alternative
ground
which
we
take
very
seriously,
your
honor,
under
section
8
of
the
sherman
act
--
excuse
me,
under
section
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act,
any
person
who
violates
the
law
is
guilty
of
a
criminal
act.
now,
section
8
of
the
sherman
act,
defines
the
term
person
there
and
it
defines
it
as
including
any
corporation
existing
under
or
authorized
by
the
laws
of
any
state.
therefore,
we
suggest
that
you
don't
have
to
determine
whether
maryland
law
or
delaware
law
or
the
laws
of
all
48
other
states
because
this
would
all
come
up
in
other
states
from
time
to
time.
you
don't
have
to
determine
whether
those
laws
provide
the
state
could
continue
to
prosecute
a
criminal
action
after
dissolution.
all
you
have
to
do
under
the
plain
language
of
section
8
of
the
sherman
act
is
to
determine
whether
the
corporation
is
in
existence.
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
very
advantageous
ground
upon
which
this
court
might
wish
to
raise.
this
case
is
an
important
one
because
it
involves
delaware
because
obviously
a
large
percentage
of
the
corporations
involved
in
interstate
commerce
are
delaware
corporations.
but
if
you
decide
this
case
by
upholding
the
court
below
and
we
think
that
their
position
is
perfectly
sound.
but
if
you'll
limit
yourself
to
the
position
that
the
court
below
took,
then
inevitably
because
of
the
difference
in
languages
of
the
other
statutes
either
other
lower
courts
or
eventually
this
court
is
going
to
be
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
language
in
delaware
is
or
is
not
applicable
to
the
language
in
new
jersey,
new
york,
texas
or
california
or
what
have
you.
and
the
lower
court
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
which
do
in
fact
go
off
on
to
analysis
of
other
state
laws
as
well
show
you
that
you're
going
to
have
48
positions
instead
of
one.
now,
very
briefly,
we
think
it
clear
that
the
value
of
corporate
criminal
liability
isn't
up
for
question
here.
their
course
or
interest
in
legal
or
philosophical
arguments
that
can
be
made
as
to
what
--
how
a
corporation
can
or
cannot
be
criminally
liable
for
anything.
but
it
certainly
well
settled
by
this
time
that
corporate
criminal
liability
particularly
under
the
sherman
act
is
one
of
the
important
and
effective
deterrents
on
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
this
is
true
even
though
it
is
also
true
as
judge
marks
stated
that
the
individual
corporate
officials
are
also
liable.
and
it's
true,
as
the
cases
have
held
despite
the
fact
that
a
parent
corporation
has
in
this
case,
may
also
be
liable.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
also
clear
that
if
by
voluntary
dissolution
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
and
in
most
of
the
other
case.
if
by
voluntary
dissolution
a
cooperation
which
has
been
indicted
or
is
about
to
be
indicted
can
evade
its
criminal
responsibilities.
but
to
that
extent
of
it,
a
fairly
significant
extent,
the
basic
sanctions
which
congress
intends
to
keep
the
sherman
act
from
being
violated
have
been
limited.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
sir.
there's
no
suggestion
in
this
case
and
it
may
very
well
be
as
they
argue
in
this
case
and
as
they
have
argued
in
other
cases
that
the
dissolution
isn't
directly
or
indirectly
related
to
escaping
fines.
however,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
we've
cited
on
page
11
of
our
brief
in
a
footnote
there
some
10
or
11
cases
in
recent
years
where
dissolution
has
suddenly
taken
place
either
immediately
before
or
immediately
after
in
a
criminal
indictment
under
the
antitrust
laws.
we
suggest
that
the
problem
is
likely
to
become
more
serious
because
congress
just
recently
has
raised
the
maximum
find
from
$5000
to
$50,000.
and
we
also
suggest,
your
honor
that
assuming
that
a
corporation
dissolves
for
reasons
of
its
own,
we
do
not
know
of
any
reason,
policy
wise
certainly,
why
the
business
judgment
to
dissolve
for
other
reason
should
carry
with
it
an
exemption
from
the
criminal
liability
for
acts
they
have
already
committed.
now,
again,
briefly,
i
don't
think
i
have
to
take
much
time
with
respect
to
the
argument
that's
made
at
some
extent
with
the
briefs
with
respect
to
debt
of
a
corporation
being
analogist
to
death
of
an
individual.
this
was
a
valid
concept
in
the
18th
century
when
corporations
--
when
they
were
dissolved
did
die
completely
and
no
further
actions
of
any
sort
are
possible.
but
as
the
modern
business
corporation
evolved
in
the
19th
century
was
obvious
that
this
was
not
in
appropriate
concept.
and
therefore,
over
a
period
of
time
starting
i
think
about
1819
in
massachusetts,
all
of
the
states
have
developed
special
statutory
provisions
which
keep
the
corporation
in
effect
for
certain
purposes
after
it
is
dissolved.
normally,
the
corporation
can
wind
up
its
business,
can
sue
and
be
sued
and
as
one
court
has
said
in
a
quotation
cited
in
our
brief,
in
effect
do
everything
necessary
to
wind
up
its
affairs
other
than
carrying
on
the
business
it
was
originally
incorporated
for.
according
to
this
court
and
all
other
courts
while
i
occasionally
have
referred
to
the
old
common
law
rule
and
occasionally
have
mentioned
that
under
the
common
law,
a
corporation
was
dead
and
it
was
dead,
have
recognized
that
dissolution
is
not
the
death
of
the
corporation
and
if
any
analogy
is
correct,
i
should
think
it
would
probably
would
be
that
dissolution
is
a
retirement,
a
force
retirement
of
a
corporation
which
you
can't
continue
in
business
but
he's
going
to
be
liable
for
what's
happened
prior
to
his
retirement.
now,
because
statute
had
taken
the
place
of
the
common
law
concepts
which
are
out
of
date
here,
this
court
has
held
that
what
must
be
done
when
the
question
comes
up
as
to
the
extent
to
which
a
corporation
exist
after
dissolution
is
look
at
the
relevant
law.
now,
this
relevant
law
starts
out
of
course
with
section
8
of
the
sherman
act,
which
says
that
a
corporation
is
liable
criminally
if
it
exist
under
the
laws
of
the
states.
while
some
of
the
judges
of
the
lower
court
level
have
in
dictum
suggested
that
the
government's
alternative
position
is
a
sound
one.
i'll
make
it
fair
to
say
that
all
of
the
decisions
today
have
gone
on
analysis
of
whether
state
law
provides
for
continuance
of
criminal
liability
after
dissolution.
and
the
court
below
here
found
that
both
the
delaware
law
and
the
maryland
law
did
provide
for
continuance.
but
we
turn
briefly
to
the
delaware
law,
and
i'll
turn
to
this
first
because
the
conflict
of
the
circuits
which
i
presume
is
the
reason
why
this
court
is
listening
to
this
case,
arises
with
respect
to
delaware
law,
there's
no
conflict
with
respect
to
maryland
law,
there
are
only
two
cases
with
respect
to
maryland
law,
both
cited
in
our
brief
and
both
cases
the
courts
have
found
that
maryland
law
does
not
abate.
the
court
--
under
maryland
law
a
criminal
action
is
not
abated
by
dissolution.
but
let's
look
at
delaware
law
upon
which
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuit.
now,
the
crucial
section
of
the
delaware
law
is
the
section
278
which
judge
marks
read
to.
and
in
our
view,
the
crucial
aspect
of
this
section
is
the
second
sentence
thereof
which
reads
with
respect
to
any
action,
suit
or
proceeding
began
before
the
corporation
is
dissolved
or
within
a
three-year
period
after
it
is
dissolve.
that
action
shall
continue
in
force
until
any
judgments
orders
or
decrees
therein
shall
be
fully
executed.
now,
that's
a
fairly
broad
language.
it
doesn't
say
with
respect
to
any
civil
action
suit
or
proceeding.
it
doesn't
use
the
word
suit
which
has
been
alone,
which
has
been
the
subject
of
conflicting
decisions
in
lower
courts.
it
doesn't
say
with
respect
to
any
action,
suit
or
proceeding
except
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
uses
the
broadest
possible
language
which
respect
to
any
action,
suit
or
proceeding
and
therefore
the
court
below
has
held
that
--
that
language
given
the
normal
meaning,
particularly
the
word
proceeding
has
always
been
given.
thus,
include
criminal
proceedings
and
that
therefore
where
you
have
a
criminal
proceeding
started
before
dissolution
or
within
a
three-year
period
thereafter,
you
have
liability
continuing
until
that
suit
is
decided.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
mean
to
be
into
and
qualifying
it,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
even
think
it's
a
court.
it's
a
very
great
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
your
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct
and,
however,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
distinguished
lower
courts
have
taken
a
narrow
ground
and
my
friend
here
spent
all
his
time
on
this
narrow
ground
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
--
i
wanted
to
at
least
go
in
to
it
somewhat.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
have
equal
confidence
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
let
me
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
let
me
get
to
the
second
ground
right
away.
i
think
there's
only
one
real
problem
about
the
second
ground.
as
far
back
as
the
northern
securities
case,
this
court
indicated
that
states
by
their
corporate
laws
cannot
immunize
corporations
from
the
sherman
act.
in
other
words,
starting
with
northern
security,
it's
quite
clear
that
delaware
could
not
have
established
a
corporation
and
said
this
corporation
shall
have
x,
y,
z
functions
but
one
of
the
functions
it
will
not
have
is
being
liable
to
federal
criminal
suit.
now,
that's
northern
securities
that's
one
with
the
law.
the
problem
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
your
honor's
difficulty
in
finding
the
difficulty
with
this
case
is
our
difficulty
too.
as
far
as
i
can
see,
the
only
grounds
that
the
petitioners
have
for
disputing
our
ultimate
position
is
some
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
chicago
title
and
trust
company
case
appearing
at
302
u.s.
120
.
now,
in
that
case,
what
had
happened
was
that
illinois
corporation
had
been
dissolved
by
the
state
of
illinois
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
illinois
law.
and
two
years
after
or
more
than
two
years
afterwards,
after
the
time
when
under
illinois
law
of
this
dissolved
corporation
could
sue
or
be
sued.
at
that
subsequent
period,
some
new
people
got
in
control
of
this
dissolved
corporation
and
they
attempted
to
utilize
section
77
(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
to
reorganize
the
corporation
and
the
question
that
the
court
passed
upon
in
the
chicago
title
and
trust
company
case
was
whether
that
was
appropriate,
whether
the
corporation
was
dead
or
not.
and
the
majority
of
this
court
in
that
case
in
an
opinion
by
judge
(inaudible)
did
find
that
after
the
time
had
expired
under
the
illinois
law
for
dissolved
corporation
to
sue
or
be
sued,
that
the
corporation
could
not
voluntarily
go
in
to
the
federal
court.
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
which
was
written
by
judge
cardozo
and
i
think
concurred
in
by
judge
stone
--
justice
stone
and
justice
black
which
indicated
that
in
their
opinion
there
was
still
a
sufficient
spark
of
life
even
though
the
corporation
could
not
be
sued
or
sue,
even
though
the
two-year
period
after
dissolution
have
expired.
who
are
this
people
to
take
advantage
of
the
bankruptcy
act?
but
my
friends
argue,
that
since
the
disposition
of
justice
cardozo
was
not
adopted
by
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
were
stopped
from
arguing
what
they
call
our
ultimate
position
which
i
would
like
to
make
our
major
position
here.
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
chicago
title
company
case
at
most
when
you
read
it
through,
indicates
an
unwillingness
on
the
part
of
the
majority
to
allow
a
corporation
which
have
been
dissolved
for
malfeasance
of
its
own
to
voluntarily
take
advantage
of
the
federal
law
after
the
period
for
which
it
could
do
anything
under
the
state
law
had
expired.
and
whether
you
agree
with
the
majority
or
the
minority
position
there,
i
suggest
that
is
not
this
case
where
the
problem
is
on
the
contrary
whether
criminal
actions
under
the
sherman
act
commenced
prior
to
the
dissolution
of
this
corporation
should
be
abated
by
the
voluntary
action
of
the
corporation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
sir.
there
(voice
overlap)
the
money
--
the
indictment
was
filed
and
then
the
corporations
were
dissolved.
they
came
into
court
and
put
up
as
one
defense
their
dissolution.
the
court
overruled
it
and
then
it
went
on
to
a
nolo
contendere
plea.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.the
case
has
not
gone
to
judgment.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
that
allows
my
friend
here
to
make
this
argument
about
existing
obligations
and
you
asked
about
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
actually,
we've
cited
in
our
brief
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
discuss.
we
cited
in
our
brief
at
least
two
lower
court
opinions
in
the
new
york
district.
but
you've
indicated
that
this
are
existing
obligation
(voice
overlap)
the
contention
what
criminal
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they're
equally
and
potentially
guilty,
i
submit,
as
if
this
corporation
two
days
before
it
had
dissolved
had
been
involved
in
some
major
tort
action.
and
yet
my
friend,
i
don't
presume
but
they
come
in
to
court
and
say
that
that
tort
action,
although
the
damages
and
all
the
other
defenses
had
not
been
determined
and
how
much
it
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
it
all
depends
on
the
law
of
the
corporation
and
the
law
of
the
corporations
if
we're
going
to
discuss
the
law
of
the
corporations
as
i've
indicated
in
delaware
any
action,
suit
or
proceeding
and
in
maryland,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
cannot
sir.
there
are
no
statutes
in
maryland
and
or
delaware
that
construe
this
matter
in
either
respect.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
with
respect
to
criminal
actions?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh
yes,
there
are
quite
a
lot
civil,
yes
but
very
few
criminal.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you
know,
i
think
they
have
given
you
some
light.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
the
addy
case.
i've
cited
on
page
26
of
our
brief
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
made
clear
that
a
dissolved
corporation
continues
in
existence
during
this
three-year
period
and
this
is
their
quote
“with
whatever
rights
it
had
or
whatever
nature
preserved
in
full
vigor.”
now,
that
is
obviously
a
quote
taken
out
of
context.
i
can
only
say
that
if
you
examine
that
position
in
full,
you'll
find
that
the
delaware
court
there
although
it
wasn't
discussing
a
criminal
problem,
was
saying
type
of
remedial
legislation
should
be
given
a
broad
construction.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
the
body
of
decisions
in
the
state
courts
is
very,
very
meager
on
this
point
if
it
exists
at
all.
this
court
as
a
matter
fact
when
it
granted
certiorari
here,
gave
leave
to
the
attorney
generals
of
both
delaware
and
maryland
to
come
in
here
if
they
had
anything
to
say
but
unfortunately
they
haven't
help
with
this
either
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
wouldn't
disagree
with
that
either.
i
would
like
to
say
in
the
brief
time
i
have
remaining
that
we've
tried
to
analyze
in
our
brief,
the
arguments
which
had
been
made
in
the
safe
safeway
case
and
in
the
line
material
case,
cases
coming
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
in
which
they
construe
the
delaware
statute
as
not
saving
criminal
actions
after
dissolution
of
the
court.
and
i
think
that
we've
shown
that
those
decisions
simply
cannot
stand
up.
the
court
in
the
safeway
case,
with
all
due
respect,
simply
focused
on
the
word
suit
and
went
off
into
a
long
analysis
of
what
the
word
suit
meant
and
didn't
even
discuss
the
word
proceeding
or
the
word
action
or
the
word
judgment,
words
which
obviously
have
a
much
broader
scope.
similarly,
the
court
in
the
line
material
case
was
able
to
find
that
criminal
actions
did
not
survive
in
delaware
by
saying,
yes,
the
word
proceeding
and
action
is
broader
but
it
merely
is
tacked
on
and
therefore
since
suit
is
the
important
word,
we're
going
to
stick
by
what
the
court
said
in
the
safeway
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
you
might
be
right
with
respect
to
the
word
suit.
i
would
say
it
was
much
more
arguable
with
respect
to
the
word
action.
but
with
respect
to
the
word
proceeding,
i
would
say
there's
no
real
argument
whatsoever.
proceeding
is
generally
a
word
used
with
respect
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
for
instance,
in
the
federal
rules
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
federal
rules
as
we
have
pointed
out,
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
throughout
used
the
term
proceeding.
the
maryland
rules
of
criminal
procedure
used
the
word
proceeding.
the
delaware
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
right.
it's
an
inclusive
term
and
therefore
when
the
statute
says
all
proceedings,
we
submit,
that
if
you
used
an
inclusive
term
and
attack
on
the
adjective
all,
you
don't
end
up
with
a
restrictive
answer
and
therefore
--
so
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
good
guess
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you
are
asked
if
you
find
it
necessary
to
construe
the
state
statute
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
they
are
providing
for
state
criminal
prosecutions.
you
are
act
to
give
reasonable
reading
to
broad
language
bearing
in
mind
the
purposes
for
which
the
broad
language
would
be
adopted.
you
are
i
think
have
to
do
so
without
the
benefit
of
any
state
interpretations
but
you
do
have
the
benefit,
i
submit,
of
some
very
good
interpretations
by
the
federal
courts.
i
would
refer,
your
honor
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
would
refer
your
honors
to
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
i
would
refer
you
honors
particularly
to
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
collier
case.
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
what
i
think
is
a
very
interesting
decision
of
the
district
court,
judge
weinfeld
in
united
states
versus
cigarette
merchandisers
association.
this
is
not
a
case
of
first
impression
as
far
the
lower
courts
are
concerned.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
united
states
versus
cigarette
merchandisers
association,
136
f.
supp.
214.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
is
a
case
--
sherman
act
case.
he
happens
to
be
construing
new
york
law
there
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
same
type
of
situation.
it's
new
york
law
but
his
analysis
of
the
reason
--
actually,
judge
weinfeld
and
the
cigarette
manufacturers
case
was
able
to
decide
it
on
a
strictly
new
york
technical
point
and
he
also
went
on
and
decided
on
the
general
construction.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
united
states
v.
cigarette
manufacturers
association,
136
f.
supp.
214.
and
the
collier
case
was
208
f.
2d
936.
well,
let
me
take
up
the
cigarette
case
first
because
it's
easy
to
answer.
the
new
york
general
construction
law
defined
action
as
including
punishment
for
a
public
offense.
so
by
the
new
york
law,
there,
are
an
action
survived
and
that
action
was
defined
by
the
new
york
law
as
including
criminal
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
new
york
general
construction
law.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
includes
punishment
for
a
public
offense.
i'm
quoting.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
three
quotation
marks,
punishment
or
a
public
offense
contrary.
in
maryland,
we
do
have
to
say
which
i've
read
to
the
courts
before
and
i
don't
think
i
need
to
read
it
again
because
it
takes
too
much
time
to
read
where
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
affirmatively
said
action
does
not
include
criminal
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
well
as
the
opposite.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
un
--
under
definition,
new
york
defined
action
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
as
including
a
public
offense
under
definitions
and
under
their
definitions
say,
action
shall
not
include
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
in
this
whole
book
which
includes
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
otherwise.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
one
other
thing
about
delaware.
the
delaware
statute
was
construed
in
the
safeway
case
in
1944
and
i
may
say
that
i
have
the
privilege
of
arguing
before
the
same
court
a
companion
case
the
kroger
case
which
was
not
reported
except
as
a
memorandum
in
which
the
same
question
was
involved
and
the
same
decision.
that
was
1944.
it's
a
long
time
since
then
and
delaware
is
quite
cognizant
to
how
its
laws
had
been
construed
and
it's
made
no
change
in
them.
so
presumably,
they
did
not
feel
that
any
change
was
necessary
by
reason
of
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
several
cases
that
criminal
cases
did
not
survive
under
the
delaware
law.
now,
i
want
to
talk
about
this
alternative
ground
for
a
moment
which
counsel
designates
himself
as
the
alternative
ground.
i
think
so
designating
which
is
fairly
with
the
secondary
ground
which
now
says,
it's
a
major
ground.
well,
the
difficulty
it
seems
to
us
at
least
is
that
(inaudible)
the
so-called
spark
of
life
theory
which
was
found
in
this
famous
case
of
the
chicago
title
and
trust
company
against
the
wilcox
building
corporation,
302
u.s.
in
that
case
as
counsel
has
properly
said,
there
was
an
illinois
corporation
which
was
dissolved.
there
it
was
dissolved
because
of
its
own
misconduct.
corporations
can
be
dissolved
because
of
the
limitation
on
their
existence,
they
can
be
dissolved
by
voluntary
act,
they
can
be
dissolved
by
failure
to
pay
their
taxes
and
having
an
action
brought
against
them
or
against
by
the
state.
here,
this
corporation
was
dissolved
but
under
illinois
law
it
could
continue
for
certain
purposes
and
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
said,
that
any
corporation
could
avail
itself
a
bankruptcy
and
so
this
corporation
which
had
a
spark
of
life,
i
use
that
word
because
that's
the
word
in
the
court's
own
opinion,
was
taken
over
by
some
other
stockholders
not
the
stockholders
who
were
guilty
and
they
filed
an
action
in
bankruptcy.
and
the
question
was,
does
that
corporation
exist
and
can
it
avail
itself
of
the
federal
law
which
says
any
corporation
which
exists
may
take
the
step.
and
here's
what
the
majority
of
the
court
said,
“how
long
and
upon
what
terms
a
state
created
corporation
may
continue
to
exist
as
a
matter
exclusively
of
state
power?”
i
won't
read
it
all.
it
hardly
will
be
claimed
that
the
federal
government
may
breathe
life
into
a
corporate
entity
thus
put
to
death
for
the
state
in
a
lawful
exercise
of
its
sovereign
power.
the
power
to
take
the
long
step
of
putting
an
end
to
the
court
with
existence
of
a
state
created
corporation
without
limitation,
connotes
the
power
to
take
the
shorter
one
of
putting
an
end
to
it
which
such
limitations
as
the
legislature
sees
fit
to
enact.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
justice
cardozo
did
too.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
justice
cardozo
thought
so
too.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
--
i
wouldn't
undertake
to
answer
it
except
for
the
court's
own
answer.
and
since
the
federal
government
is
powerful
to
resurrect
a
court
or
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
it
had
a
spark
of
life
so
justice
cardozo's.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
they
say
that
the
state
has
put
it
and
since
the
federal
government's
power
is
to
resurrect
a
corporation
which
a
state
has
put
out
of
existence
for
all
purposes,
the
conclusion
seems
inevitable
that
if
the
state
attaches
qualifications
to
its
sentence
of
extinction
nothing
can
been
added
or
taken
from
these
qualifications
by
federal
authority.
now,
i
think
that
is
the
court's
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
now,
going
on
from
that,
i
may
say
that
there
were
two
or
three
members
of
the
court
who
disagree
and
filed
their
able
dissenting
opinions,
i
confess
that
when
i
read
the
majority
and
sometimes
the
dissents
that
--
i'm
glad
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
court.
it
has
to
decide
between
the
two.
but
nevertheless
i
take
the
law
as
it's
finally
declared
by
this
court
and
never
departed
from
since
that
case.
now,
counsel
says
that
we're
going
back
to
the
18th
century
to
say
that
the
death
of
a
corporation
maybe
pointed
to
the
death
of
an
individual.
but
i
happen
to
have
been
a
member
of
a
court
where
chief
justice
pass
on
to
get
his
judicial
career
and
i
have
a
high
respect
for
chief
justice
taft's
opinions
and
i
don't
think
they're
an
acronyms
of
the
18th
century.
speaking
for
this
court,
he
said,
in
oklahoma
natural
gas
company
against
oklahoma
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
there
is
no
specific
provision
in
our
rules
for
the
substitution
of
the
party
litigant
of
a
successor
to
a
dissolved
corporation.
it
is
well
settled
that
a
common
law
and
in
the
federal
jurisdiction,
a
corporation
who
has
been
dissolved
as
if
it
did
not
exist
and
resulted
in
a
dissolution
cannot
be
distinguished
from
the
death
of
a
natural
person
in
its
effect.citing
cases
and
going
on
and
completing
the
equation
because
of
time
limitations,
i
will
not
read
anymore.
the
court
asked
and
counsel
properly
replied,
this
corporation
did
not
endeavor
these
corporations
which
were
dissolved,
did
not
endeavor
to
evade
any
responsibility.
it
was
somewhat
of
a
coincidence
if
the
solution
occurred
at
the
time
that
it
was
predetermined
as
the
affidavit
shows
here
by
an
endeavor
to
comply
with
the
federal
trade
commission
rule
which
rule
that
there
should
not
be
separate
selling
companies
but
there
should
be
one
selling
company,
and
therefore
these
corporations
were
dissolved.
when
they
say
that
action
is
--
or
suit
is
enlarged
by
the
word
proceeding
because
we
have
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i
want
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
wherever
you
find
the
word
procedure
being
used
as
meaning
something
criminal,
it's
always
proceeded
by
the
word
criminal
procedure,
criminal
procedure
and
that's
to
be
found
if
you
just
open
their
own
brief
and
read
it
every
time
they
quote
where
it
says
proceeding
and
means
criminal,
it
says
criminal
proceeding
and
nowhere
have
either
of
these
states
ever
used
that
term.
now,
as
far
as
the
addy
case
is
concerned
which
he
speaks
of
a
showing
light
on
this
situation,
in
the
addy
case,
a
dissolved
corporation
became
the
reverter
under
a
deed
whereby
it
was
provided
that
if
the
government,
i
think,
failed
to
use
certain
land
as
a
life
saving
station,
it
reverted
to
the
corporation
which
gave
it.
and
so
they
said,
“yes”
under
the
very
language
of
the
legislature.
they
can
--
they
have
a
sufficient
spark
of
life
to
get
their
property
back
and
distribute
it.
that's
the
--
it's
a
winding
up
process
the
same
as
the
executors
or
administrators
of
a
dead
man's
estate
would
get
a
reverter.
