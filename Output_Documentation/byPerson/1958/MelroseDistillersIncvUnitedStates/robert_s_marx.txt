mr.
robert
s.
marx
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
take
it
that
you
are
all
familiar
with
the
question
presented
so
i'll
plunge
immediately
into
the
statutes
that
are
involved.
the
common
law,
as
your
honors
know,
when
a
corporation
was
dissolved
or
put
to
death
either
by
limitation
or
forfeiture
or
by
its
own
act,
that
was
the
end
of
the
whole
situation
and
the
corporation
could
no
longer
prosecute
any
claims
that
it
might
have
for
its
property
and
anyone
who
had
a
claim
against
it
for
compensation
or
for
money
was
without
remedy.
therefore,
it
was
an
order
to
relieve
against
the
harshness
of
the
common
law
that
statutes
such
as
we
have
here
in
maryland
and
delaware
were
enacted
to
enable
a
corporation
to
--
for
a
limited
period
to
recover
any
property
that
it
might
have
or
to
enable
those
who
had
been
injured
by
some
civil
act
of
the
corporation
to
recover.
the
maryland's
--
that
is
fully
set
forth
at
page
15
of
our
brief
where
we
quote
from
fletcher
on
corporations
in
which
he
says,
“statutes
of
this
type
are
broadly
remedial
and
statutes
for
whining
up
the
affairs
of
dissolved
corporations
or
embodiment
of
equitable
doctrine.
they
are
remedial
and
should
receive
liberal
constructions.
and
that
they
do
not
extend
the
right
to
sue
such
corporations
on
debts
not
in
existence
--
mr.
robert
s.
marx
unfortunately,
no,
ironically.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
unfortunately,
we
have
no
guide.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
that's
unfortunately
it.
that's
why
i've
said
i
would
plunge
immediately
into
a
discussion
of
those
maryland
laws.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
i
don't
think
that
the
government's
second
point
rises
beyond
the
maryland
law
because
if
these
corporations
are
not
in
existence
for
criminal
purposes
after
they
have
been
dissolved
then
they
are
not
in
existence,
the
government
is
not
(inaudible)
by
its
alternative
contentions.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
--
maryland
statute
which
is
referred
to
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
very
short.
the
dissolution
of
a
corporation
shall
be
effective
when
the
articles
of
dissolution
have
been
accepted
for
a
record
by
the
commission.
the
record
here
shows
that
it
was
accepted.
provided,
however,
that
the
corporation
shall
continue
in
existence
for
the
purpose
of
paying,
satisfying
and
discharging
any
existing
debts
and
obligations.
collecting
and
distributing
its
assets
and
doing
all
other
acts
required
to
liquidate
and
wind
up
its
business
and
affairs.
now,
there's
no
other
purpose
for
which
exists.
it
exists
for
the
purpose
of
paying,
satisfying
and
discharging
any
existing
debts
and
obligations.
it's
well
settled
that
a
fine
in
a
criminal
case
imposed
after
a
determination
of
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
long
after
the
dissolution
of
a
corporation
is
not
an
existing
debt
or
obligation.
now
that
is
followed
by
another
sentence
--
mr.
robert
s.
marx
no,
if
your
honor
please,
it
cannot.
this
court
so
held
on
the
mitchell
case.
senator
mitchell,
it's
quoted
in
our
brief,
i
believe
he
was
senator.
he
was
found
guilty
and
fined
and
during
the
appeal
he
died.
and
that
caused
the
criminal
prosecution
to
be
moot
and
the
case
was
dismissed
but
the
government
sought
to
collect
the
fine
from
its
estate
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
debt.
it
was
held
it
was
not
--
mr.
robert
s.
marx
well,
i
believe,
if
the
court
please,
that
i
would
sort
of
categorically
say
that
is
the
law
that
it's
not
a
debt.
it's
about
or
a
fine.
it
carries
no
interest.
you
cannot
be
imprisoned
for
it.
it
has
no
characteristics
of
it
--
it
can
be
imprisoned
for
it.
you
cannot
be
imprisoned
for
a
debt.
well,
i'm
going
to
pass
that
point
because
we
covered
enough
--
mr.
robert
s.
marx
no.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
well,
you
could
have
(voice
overlap)
--
no
but
if
it
was
an
individual,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
that's
true.
we
--
we
cover
that
fully
on
our
brief
and
the
next
section
i
think
throws
further
light
on
this
situation.
the
dissolution
of
a
corporation
--
this
is
section
78
(a)
shall
not
relieve
its
stockholders,
directors
or
officers
from
any
obligation
and
liability
imposed
on
them
by
law.
now,
i
take
if
that
would
mean
that
if
in
case
of
stockholders
double
liability,
they
are
not
relieved.
in
case
of
director's
liability
they
are
not
relieved.
in
case
of
unpaid
stock
subscriptions
they
are
not
relieved.
labor
claims
sometimes
are
imposed
upon
the
officers
or
directors.
that
is
the
end
of
the
section
insofar
as
the
substance
of
law
is
concerned.
that
is
the
semicolon.
then
follows
what
i
submit
and
on
very
good
authority
is
purely
procedural.
nor
shall
such
dissolution
abate
any
pending
suit
or
proceeding
by
or
against
the
corporation.
and
all
such
suits
maybe
continued
with
such
substitution
of
parties,
if
any
as
the
court
directs.
well,
of
course
there
cannot
be
any
substitution
of
parties
in
a
criminal
case.
this
acts
as
procedural
provision
relates
to
civil
procedure
as
i
will
demonstrate
in
just
a
moment.
no
receiver
shall
institute
suit
except
by
order
of
the
court
appointing
him
and
such
suit
maybe
brought
in
his
own
name
as
receiver
or
notwithstanding
its
dissolution
in
the
name
of
the
corporation
to
refuse.
now,
in
1956,
the
supreme
court
of
maryland
undertook
to
codify
the
maryland
rules
of
procedure
and
they
provided
in
those
rules
of
procedure
under
rule
222,
under
the
heading,
dissolution
of
a
corporation.
an
action
by
or
against
the
corporation
shall
not
abate
by
reason
of
the
dissolution,
forfeiture
of
charter,
merger
or
consolidation
of
such
corporation.
such
action
maybe
continued
with
such
change
of
parties
as
the
court
may
direct.
now,
i
take
that
court
will
immediately
ask,
well
couldn't
that
be
a
criminal
action?
and
the
answer
is
found
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
under
rule
5
definition.
it
has
used
in
these
rules
the
following
terms
have
the
following
meanings.
action,
action
shall
include
all
the
steps
by
which
a
party
seeks
to
enforce
any
right
in
a
court
of
law
or
equity.
unless,
otherwise,
indicated
the
word
action
shall
include
in
appeal,
take
into
a
court
of
record
from
the
final
decision
of
an
inferior
core
of
administrative
body
where
such
appeal
is
authorized
by
statute.
action
shall
not
include
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
i
call,
your
honor's
attention
to
whenever
the
word
proceeding
is
used
to
indicate
criminal
proceedings
it's
always
preceded
by
the
word
criminal.
in
other
words,
the
two
are
coupled
together
as
they
are
here.
now,
as
further
evidence,
that
this
provision
after
the
semi-calling
nor
shall
dissolution
abate
any
pending
suit
or
proceeding
was
purely
procedural
and
not
part
of
the
substantive
law.
after
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
as
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
had
codified
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
as
well.
the
legislature
came
along
and
in
the
laws
of
maryland
of
1957,
and
this
i
do
not
think
it's
in
our
brief,
they
enacted
a
long
list
of
laws
to
remove
any
procedural
matters
from
the
statutes.
and
so
as
eliminating
doubt
that
this
was
procedural,
the
enacting
clause
says,
“to
remove
from
the
code
of
public
general
laws
of
maryland,
procedural
provisions
superseded
by
or
inconsistent
with
the
rules
or
procedure
approved
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
on
july
18th,
1956
to
take
effect
on
january
1,
1957
and
known
as
the
maryland
rules.”
now,
if
anyone
wishes
to
make
a
note
of
it.
mr.
robert
s.
marx
the
citation
is
to
chapter
399
of
the
laws
of
maryland
and
what
i've
just
read
will
be
found
at
the
bottom
of
page
524,
the
laws
of
maryland
of
1957.
it's
a
long
and
acting
law
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
pointing
out
where
it's
to
be
found.
it's
four
or
five
pages
long
so
that's
the
part
that's
important
here.
now,
when
we
come
to
chapter
399
at
page
544,
the
same
volume,
we
find
the
act
passed
by
the
legislation
which
is
entitled
“effective
dissolution”.
and
it
simply
says
the
dissolution
of
a
corporation
shall
not
relieve
its
stockholders,
directors
or
officers
from
any
obligations
and
liabilities
imposed
on
them
by
law.
in
other
words,
all
of
the
procedural
part
which
follows
the
semicolon
is
deleted
because
that
is
procedural.
it's
covered
by
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
so
recognized
by
the
legislature.
so
i
think
it's
quite
clear.
now,
if
there
ever
was
any
doubt,
it's
been
clarified
by
the
legislature
and
by
the
highest
court
of
maryland
that
the
only
thing
that
continues
is
a
civil
action
and
that
suit
or
proceeding
relates
to
civil
actions
and
does
not
embrace
criminal
actions.
and
since
the
law
is
also
quite
clear
that
the
state
which
brings
a
corporation
into
life
may
also
put
in
to
death
or
may
enable
it
to
continue
for
certain
specific
purposes
and
no
other
that
maryland
has
permitted
by
a
remedial
legislation
a
corporation
to
continue
for
the
purpose
of
winding
up,
so
to
speak,
and
pay
existing
obligations
but
criminal
actions
are
not
continued
and
therefore
abate.
in
our
brief,
we've
endeavored
to
set
forth
the
distinction
which
probably
is
arguing
the
obvious
between
civil
and
the
criminal
prosecutions
and
i
do
not
think
it's
necessary
to
argue
the
obvious
here
in
that
respect.
certainly,
the
issue
in
a
criminal
case
is
guilt
or
innocence.
and
the
fine
which
is
all
that
could
be
imposed
against
the
corporation
does
not
come
into
existence
until
the
preliminary
issue
is
determined.
in
a
civil
case
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
corporation
had
any
liability
to
respond
or
compensate
for
matters
which
arose
prior
to
its
dissolution
or
whether
he
had
any
title
of
the
property
which
it
could
recover.
now,
when
we
come
to
the
law
of
delaware,
we
find
that,
in
substance,
the
same
although
the
wording
is
somewhat
different.
the
delaware
statute
is
also
in
our
brief
and
it's
not
too
long.
it's
at
bottom
of
page
5,
all
corporations
whether
they
expire
by
their
own
limitation
or
otherwise
dissolved,
shall
be
continued
for
three
years
from
such
expiration
or
dissolution
embodies
corporate
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
and
defending
suits
by
and
against
them
and
enable
them
to
gradually
settle
and
close
their
business
to
dispose
off
and
convey
their
property
and
divide
their
capital
stock
but
not
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
the
business
for
which
the
corporation
shall
have
been
established.
with
respect
to
any
action,
suit
or
proceedings
began
or
commenced
by
or
against
the
corporation,
prior
to
the
expiration
or

with
respect
to

corporation

only

the
purpose
of
such
action,
suit
or
proceedings
so
began
or
commenced
be
continued
body
is
corporate.
now,
there
is
another
section
of
the
law
which
says
what
those
persons
who
continually
may
do
after
dissolutions?
it's
quite
clear
from
that
section
that
they
must
apply
the
assets
to
the
existing
obligations
and
that
no
debt
or
claim
exists
at
the
time
of
dissolution
or
until
the
fine
is
levied
in
this
case,
two
years
thereafter.
at
page
25
of
our
brief,
your
honors
will
find
that
other
section
quoted.it's
section
281
and
i
think
it
appears
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
trustees
are
receivers
of
a
dissolved
corporation.
after
the
payment
of
all
allowances,
expenses
and
costs
and
the
satisfaction
of
all
special
and
general
liens
upon
the
funds
of
the
corporation,
the
extent
of
the
lawful
priority
shall
pay
other
debts
due
from
the
corporation
if
the
funds
are
sufficient,
if
not,
they
shall
distribute
the
same
ratably
among
the
creditors
who
shall
prove
their
debts.
and
any
balance
remaining
after
the
payment
of
the
debts
and
necessary
expenses,
they
shall
distribute
and
pay
to
those
who
maybe
justly
entitled
thereto.
rather,
this
clearly
has
reference
to
the
civil
creditors
and
civil
liabilities
and
that
is
the
only
purpose
for
which
is
continued
the
same
as
under
the
maryland
statute.
now,
the
government
argues
that
the
public
policy
should
motivate
the
court
to
interpret
the
statutes
so
as
to
include
criminal
cases.
we
have
submitted
that
there's
no
need
for
doing
so,
particularly
in
this
case
because
first
place,
the
question
is
moot.
the
company
is
no
longer
in
existence.
secondly,
the
individuals
who
are
its
directors
and
officers
are
liable
to
punishment
particularly
under
the
antitrust
laws
which
specifically
provide
that
every
director
and
officer
of
a
corporation
shall
--
who
participated
in
the
acts
of
the
corporation
shall
be
equally
guilty
with
the
corporation
that
personal
liability
to
punish
or
continue
in
this
particular
case,
an
individual
officer
of
each
one
of
these
companies
was
indicted
and
was
fined.
the
stockholders
whom
the
corpora
--
whom
the
counsel
for
the
government
argues
ought
to
be
punished,
it
would
be
a
startling
doctrine.
stockholders
are
not
guilty
of
the
crimes
of
the
corporation.
and
the
corporation
is
a
completely
separate
and
distinct
entity.
and
if
we
were
endeavored
to
break
down
that
doctrine,
we
would
be
molding
a
policy
of
far
reaching
consequences
which
would
destroy
the
separate
corporate
entity
under
which
stockholders
enjoy
various
immunities
and
certainly
it's
a
unique
doctrine
that
you
will
punish
the
stockholders
for
the
crimes
of
the
corporation.
stockholders
may
even
change
from
day
to
day.
i
endeavor
to
reserve
some
time
for
reply
and
i'll
