justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
--
do
we
have
to
determine
what
maryland
and
delaware
cases
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no?
you
said
unfortunately
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
but
we
have
to
determine
what
maryland
and
delaware
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
that's
really
is,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
--
why
do
you
say
that?
it
can
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
prove
that
maryland
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
imprison
the
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
haven't
got
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
it
is
individuals
of
the
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
second
ground
rule,
i
don't
quite
follow
why
(inaudible)
has
taken
careful
analysis
with
the
delaware
law.
as
i
understand
your
second
ground
is
that
if
by
the
law
of
--
by
the
law
of
the
two
corporations,
a
corporation
isn't
out
of
existence
is
indeed
for
whatever
purposes
a
state
chooses
(inaudible)
then
it
is
a
corporation
however
made
and
disabled
and
therefore
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
should
be
liable
to
a
federal
statute,
is
a
question
for
it
in
--
in
construing
or
rather
implying
a
federal
statute.
so
that
i
don't
see
why
you
--
in
the
argument
you
now
make
a
proceeding
--
why
you
don't
fit
into
and
qualify
your
own
second
contention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
seek
to
establish
that
by
factual
analysis
in
reduction,
even
in
the
delaware
law,
there's
a
good
deal
of
vitality
to
this
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
what
is
said
to
be
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
second
proposition
--
your
second
basis
is
the
one
you
urge
here
isn't
properly
enough
that
if
there'd
be
enough
life
in
it
and
what
was
the
full
corporation
other
meaning
and
maybe
it
is.
and
that's
all
that
you
have
to
look
to
for
state
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
of
federal
--
construction
of
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
is
it
going
for
sherman
law
basis
on
the
basis
of
state
law
for
a
fortiori
but
the
manner
in
which
you
started
out
and
indicated
that
you
have
much
more
confidence
on
the
second
ground
than
on
the
third.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
but
you
--
you
don't
want
to
forget
the
second
ground
and
indeed
you
want
to
embrace
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
a
nearer
--
a
more
nearly
accurate
application
--
the
application
you're
making
with
northern
securities
is
that
what
many
state
statutes
corporate
--
corporation
laws
have
said,
it
has
functions
and
policy
a,
c
and
d
and
it
can't
consolidate
with
another
railroad
at
the
common
railroad
corporate
statute
and
nothing
the
delaware
could
do
and
could
disable
that
would
foreclose
the
government
of
the
united
states
said
in
fact
to
northern
pacific
and
the
union
pacific
did
apply
and
therefore
--
i
mean
a
question
of
violating
the
sherman
law,
the
question
of
fact
in
such
a
case
did
consolidate
having
engaged
or
did
get
together
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
if
--
are
you
sitting
down?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
or
perhaps
you
can
dispose
this
if
permitted
mr.
marx
here.
here,
there
was
a
money
judgment
ended
while
the
corporation
was
alive,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there
wasn't
a
judgment
held
and
then
a
dissolution
and
then
the
question
of
whether
that
money
judgment,
that
raises
--
i
happen
to
be
interested
in
a
way
in
a
very
abstract
way
--
that
was
a
very
interesting
question
where
it
involves
behind
the
money
judgment
as
to
the
source
of
the
money
judgment
in
that
appeal
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
you
didn't
even
have
a
money
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
having
gone
to
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
any
existing
obligation
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
if
they're
found
guilty,
then
they
enacted
judgment
for
x
dollars
and
then
you'll
have
the
obligation
to
fix
it,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
potentially
--
they're
potentially
guilty,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
law
depends
on
the
law
of
the
corporation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
for
one,
i
will
be
greatly
interested
if
you
could
point
to
indication
(inaudible)
decision,
maryland
and/or
delaware
in
which
they
construe
the
three
words
that
you've
just
uttered
as
applying
to
penal
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
there
been
many
decisions
construing
the
scope
of
survivability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
generally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
object
in
so
constrained
if
i
was
to
state
that
they
haven't
talked
beyond
their
(voice
overlap)
of
some
light?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
want
to
know
whether
the
body
of
decision
indicates
an
attitude
of
holding
the
corporation
amenable
--
an
attitude
of
amenability
of
subjection
to
responsibility
--
to
contingent
liabilities
or
the
other
way
around.
for
me,
that
would
be
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
ought
to
be
commended
if
they
have
nothing
to
say.
i
should
think
that's
most
commendable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
give
you
a
little
more
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
words
suit,
proceeding
etcetera,
are
words
found
in
other
kinds
of
statute
where
courts
have
to
construe
their
applicability
to
criminal
consequences
of
criminal
proceedings.
now,
am
i
wrong
in
having
a
not
very
firm
notion
on
the
whole,
the
tendency
has
been
to
restrict
those
terms
not
to
include
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
instance
if
the
statute
of
limitations
or
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
inclusive
term.
that
is
an
inclusive
term,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
were
asked
to
make
a
good
guess,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
asked
to
make
a
good
guess
if
a
fair
descent
reasonable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
federal?
by
the
federal
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
in
your
brief
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judge
weinfeld,
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
same
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
see
it
again.
what
law
of
new
york
defines
action
to
include
punishments?
the
survival
provision
of
the
corporation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
whenever
you
see
the
word
action
in
new
york,
it
means
also
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
much
at
large
of
new
york
city
opposite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
they
--
did
they
if
i
may
--
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
say,
as
general
maryland
law
action
does
not
include
criminal
prosecution
or
did
they
say
it
in
a
special
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
general
maryland
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
any
doubt
that
congress
if
it
wants
to
do,
would
provide
--
i
think
just
to
settle
in
the
prima
facie
respectfully
takes
the
question
there
from
the
results
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
not
the
common
enterprise
of
us
lawyers
if
we
all
(inaudible).
but
if
he
--
if
a
corporation
has
legal
capacity
for
certain
purposes,
you
don't
suggest
that
congress
couldn't
say,
so
long
as
you
have
legal
capacity
to
some
purposes,
you
must
continue
liable
for
what
you
did
while
you
have
a
full
capacity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
question
is
it
dead
--
you
don't
get
to
resurrection
and
tell
me
i'm
dead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
