--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hazard,
is
your
claim
here
any
less
general
that
in
procter
and
gamble
merely
because
you
ask
for
the
transcript
of
one
witness
where
all
you
ask
was,
“were
you
a
witness?”
and
he
said
“yes,”
“then,
we
want
the
transcript.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
you
could
just
as
well
do
that
for
every
witness
and
the
sum
of
those
requests
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
in
procter
and
gamble
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
asked
him
no
other
questions,
except,
“did
you
testify?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
right?

chief
justice
earl

then
if
you
contend
here
that
your
client
was
entitled
to
this
statement
--
this
testimony
as
a
matter
of
right
or
that
the

abused
his
discretion
in
this
situation
and
not
giving
it
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
in
your
own
time.

justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.

earl
warren
mr.
elman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

the
time
that
this
request

the
other
witnesses
testified
those
that
the
counsel
said
--
showed
animosity
on
the
part
of
jonas
toward
his
client,
or
did
mr.

was
mr.

an
early
--
chief
justice

warren
--
witness
to

justice

justice

may
finish
your
statement.

justice
earl
warren
mr.

you
may
conclude.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.

for
a
second.
