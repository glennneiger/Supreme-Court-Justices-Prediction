justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
question
of
--
your
opposing
counsel
makes
a
point
that
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
about
which
we've
read
a
great
deal
and
many
people
had
read
a
great
deal,
may
just
me
a
kind
of
chivalrous
anyway,
that
it
doesn't
amount
to
much.
he
says,
“first
of
all,
you've
been
protected
entirely
simply
by
not
having
a
transcript
made.”
and,
that's
completely
within
the
control
of
the
government,
isn't
that
correct?
secondly,
he
says
“if
you
do
go
to
trial
after
a
grand
jury
indictment,
since
the
transcript,
if
the
transcript
is
available
to
the
government,
then
anything
that
happened
in
the
grand
jury
will
or
may
be
made
public.
first
of
all,
if
the
witness
testifies,
as
he
did,
before
the
grand
jury,
then
the
beans
are
spilled.
if
he
testifies
in
some
other
way,
then
the
grand
jury
transcript
can
be
used
to
impeach
him,
and
then,
the
beans
are
spilled.”
now,
what
do
you
say
to
that
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
that
may
--
that
may
be
two
or
three.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
you
realize
that.
do
you
concede
that
those
arguments
do
have
some
validity
as
an
objection
to
the
trial
court's
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is
that,
in
this
context,
secrecy
has
disappeared
anyway,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt,
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
we
don't
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
here,
in
any
form,
the
grand
jury
testimony,
do
we,
mr.
elman?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
was
correct.
