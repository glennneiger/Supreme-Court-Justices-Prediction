justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
said
in
jencks
about
grand
jury
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
why
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jencks
is
dealing
with
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
why
do
you
--
then,
why
do
read
jencks
as
dealing
with
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
am
always
in
the
federal
court
that
stood
on
different
basis,
from
the
beginning
of
time
down
to
date
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
on
this
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
i
--
that's
why
i
came
down
here
today.
i
was
maybe
leaving
room
for
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
socony.
you
couldn't
do
with
reference
to
any
other
refreshment
what
was
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
socony,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
you
couldn't
do
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
non-grand
jury
refreshments,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
you
couldn't
--
in
that,
you
couldn't
do,
you
couldn't
refresh,
the
hundreds
of
refreshments
that
were
made
in
that
case
through
any
other
aid
except
grand
jury
without
showing
it
to
the
other
side,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
motion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
that
motion
renewed
later
in
any
qualified
form?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
elman,
i
am
one
member
of
the
court.
i
hope
you
don't
rest
merely
on
the
fact
that
these
are
not
new
arguments.
they
might
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
good
even
though
old.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
unless
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that,
unless
you
were
a
practitioner
in
new
york
over
a
good
many
years
and
had
seen
the
two
systems
in
the
operation,
grand
jury
minutes
allowed
in
the
state
courts
are
not
allowed
in
the
federal
courts,
you
couldn't
present
one
of
the
most
important
arguments
relevant
to
this
subject
matter.
that's
why
all
the
new
york
judges
and
the
federal
courts
feel
as
strongly
as
they
do
about
that
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
elman,
just
to
reach
the
brief,
our
tune
is
whether
the
government
refers
to
the
douds,
the
case
where
the
second
circuit,
which
feels
very
strongly
on
this
subject,
reversed
for
failure
to
disclose
the
grand
jury
minutes
in
the
remington
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because,
there,
that
was
a
charge
of
perjury
and,
there,
the
court
--
judge
swan,
i
believe.
i
forget.
i
don't
remember.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
judge
swan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
that
perjury
is
something
else
began,
that
it
is
so
vital
where
truth-telling
or
confidence
that's
in
his
present
testimony
may
be
derived
from
the
fact
that
he
told
it
previously
makes
it
necessary
to
allow
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
be
seen
because
they're
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
not
wounded
in
the
second
circuit
about
that.
that's
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
really
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
say
they
do
open
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
repeating
it?
2
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
all
the
cases
of
reversals
for
failure
to
make
accessible
the
grand
jury
minutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
rose
case
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
rose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
allowed
it
in
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
trial
court
allowed
it
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
in
the
johnson
case,
he
indicated
that
he
can't
get
the
grand
jury
minutes
just
in
order
to
invalidate
or
subvert
the
legality
of
the
grand
jury.
that
was
the
johnson
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
amended
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
those
witnesses,
the
other
nine
witnesses
for
the
government,
witnesses
to
matters
of
--
technical
matters
not
dealing
with
the
merits
of
the
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
--
at
what
stage
was
this
request
for
the
grand
jury
minutes?
that
is,
at
what
stage
of
the
cross-examination
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right
after
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
any
cross-examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
there
was
--
if
i
were
to
read
the
direct
and
cross,
i
would
not
find
that,
on
the
cross,
he's
already
been
hemming
and
hawing
and
shown
to
a
visitation
of
some
resolving.
generally
showed
himself
to
be
a
shifty
and
not
fully
reliable
witness.
that
is
not
his
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
merely
on
the
basis
of
his
opening
--
at
the
opening
inquiry
by
you
or
by
your
counsel
associate."
did
you
testify
in
the
grand
jury?"
"yes."
"was
it
referring
to
the
same
subject
matter?"
"i
ask
for
the
grand
jury
minutes."
that's
the
record,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
he
show
on
the
cross
that
he
was
a
--
or
that
the
experienced
trial
judge,
such
as
judge
paul
is,
in
the
court
of
appeal
that
this
is
not
a
truth-telling
witness?
on
the
basis
of
the
direct,
could
you
say
that
if
you
read
it
in
the
court
prints?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
whether
the
judge
would
have
had
his
suspicion
as
a
very
experienced
judge.
judge
paul,
like
all
experienced
judges,
has
the
notes,
different
kinds
of
notes
from
opposing
counsel,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
their
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
two
kinds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
say
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
--
did
he
say
it
was
mechanical?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
that
does
not
preclude
that
if
judge
paul
had
been
in
--
as
he
sat
there
and
listened,
as
a
careful
trial
judge
does,
perhaps
he
even
get
to
call
and
even
takes
notes,
doesn't
he?
did
he?
did
he
ask?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
listening
with
the
experienced
old
facts
and
nerves,
if
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
this
is
a
very
shifty
witness,
non-constant,
he
wouldn't
have
found
contradiction
or
suspicion
for
the
basis
of
contradiction
in
that
very
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
he
didn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
non-constant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
as
easy,
indeed,
easier
for
me
to
incur
from
that,
that
he
thought,
so
far
as
he
was
a
judge
of
a
witness'
truth-telling
capacity,
this
was
a
--
this
is
a
truth-telling
witness.
that's
the
impression
he
made
on
him
and,
that
being
my
impression
of
the
trial
judge,
unless
you
give
me
some
good
ground
for
disturbing
that
clear
impression,
i
won't
ask
for
the
grand
jury
minutes
based
--
that
the
request
was
merely
on
the
fact
that
he's
been
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
damaging
testimony
may
be
truthful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
cross-examination
is
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
bring
up
those
points
and
to
make
the
jury
alert
to
the
fact
that
a
fellow
who
has
an
extreme
bias
is
likely
to
color
his
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
second
circuit
required
an
allegation
of
inconsistency,
not
to
establish
it
but
merely
an
assertion
by
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
turned
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
panel
in
that
case?
do
you
happen
to
remember?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i'm
very
confident
i
could
think
of
at
least
three
circuit
judges
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
who
would
not
deem
that
as
a
basis,
mere
assertion
by
counsel,
in
that
circuit,
who
would
not
deem
that
as
a
ground
for
even
reading
the
minutes
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
for
the
government
to
waive
that
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
--
