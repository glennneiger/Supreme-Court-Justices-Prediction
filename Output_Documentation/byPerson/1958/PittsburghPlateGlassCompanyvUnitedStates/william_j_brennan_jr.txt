that
doesn't
quite
apply
where
the
government
needs
the
witness.
we
know
now
who
the
witness
is
and
the
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
here
is
whether
that
witness',
and
only
that
witness',
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
falsely
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
mean,
not
necessarily
consciously
precariously
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
different
argument
and,
if
i
may
say
so,
i
think
a
much
better
one
than
any
notion
of
the
identity
of
the
witnesses
has
to
be
this
one,
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
type
of
testimony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
makes
a
little
more
sense
to
me
than
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
elman
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
this
is
a
suggestion
that
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
to
turn
over
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
a
witness
to
the
defense
for
purposes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
cross-examination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
interest
--
how
would
you
go
about
it?
now,
here,
your
suggestion
is,
i
gather,
that
the
motion
was
just
shotgun,
“give
us
the
whole
--
all
of
his
testimony,”
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
to
--
what
form
of
motion
should
have
been
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
on
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
premise
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
would
expect
defense
counsel
to
pinpoint
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
that
particular
portion
of
his
grand
jury
testimony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
refer
us
in
the
record
where
it
is,
where
the
press
con
for
his
testimony
was
made
on
behalf
of
your
client
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
me.
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
mean
that
the
request
which
was
referred
to
yesterday
is
the
same
in
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
behalf
of
your
client?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
