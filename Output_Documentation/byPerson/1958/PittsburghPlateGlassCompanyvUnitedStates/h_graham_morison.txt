mr.
h.
graham
morison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
individual
defendant
in
this
case,
john
messer,
sr.
and
two
corporations,
the
mt.
airy
mirror
company,
and
the
galax
mirror
company
of
which
mr.
messer
is
a
corporate
officer.
the
issues
here
are
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
pittsburgh,
which
was
heard
at
the
end
of
the
session
yesterday.
mr.
chief
justice,
on
yesterday,
you
asked
counsel
for
pittsburgh
if
the
defendants
contended
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
grand
jury
testimony
of
all
witnesses,
and
we'd
like
to
clear
that
up
so
far
as
these
defendants
are
concerned.
the
answer,
of
course,
is
no.
in
this
case,
however,
as
i
will
demonstrate,
the
facts
were
that
there
was
one
key
witness.
he
is
so
characterized
by
the
government,
jonas,
and
this
man
jonas
decimated
the
defendants
by
his
testimony,
one
witness.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
might
point
out
that
there
were
10
defendants
in
this
case
and,
as
a
working
rule
of
court
and
with
the
court
in
chambers,
it
was
understood
that
an
objection
by
any
counsel
for
defense
would
be
applicable
to
each
of
the
others
unless
counsel
should
accept
and
show
--
so
notify
the
court.
now,
as
to
whether
mr.
chief
justice,
under
other
circumstances,
it
would
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes?
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
it
is.
it
was
made
on
behalf
of
all
defendants.
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
was
saying,
of
course,
whether
under
other
circumstances,
in
another
fact
situation,
in
another
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
trial
jury
--
trial
judge
to
make
a
grand
jury
testimony
made
available
to
any
number
of
witnesses
would
be
10
--
would
depend,
we
believe,
upon
the
particular
facts
in
each
situation.
but,
as
i
pointed
out
here,
10
defendants
requested
the
grand
jury
testimony
only
of
jonas,
although
there
were
numerous
other
government
witnesses
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
who
testified
at
trial,
and
no
request
was
made
for
their
testimony.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
no,
sir.
there
--
there
were
certainly
two
witnesses
for
the
government.
mr.
buchan
and
mr.
stroupe,
who
testified
as
to
the
critical
issues
of
fact
of
what
occurred
at
this
meeting
at
the
bluffs
where
the
government
contends,
there
was
an
agreement.
but,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
that's
all
right
sir.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
contend
here
that
the
standards
that
we
seek
--
think
are
appropriate,
in
any
weight
of
this,
the
trial
judge's
discretion.
that
is
not
contended.
we
do
not
believe
it
involves
any
change
of
rule
6
(e).
we
do
not
believe
that
it
involves
the
overruling
of
any
case
decided
by
this
court
on
this
issue.
and,
i'd
like
to
develop
that,
if
i
could,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
now,
it
is
our
contention,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
you
cannot
understand
the
sinuous
of
fundamentals
in
this
case
unless
you
look
at
the
facts
as
it
pertains
to
my
client.
john
messer,
a
man
of
advanced
years,
a
man
of
very
positive
and
determinative
personality
who
had
been
a
vigorous
price
competitor,
who
completely
controlled
the
price
policies
of
his
company,
went
to
the
asheville
meeting
which
was
with
the
mirror
manufacturer's
association
and,
quite
in
character,
as
we
reveal
from
the
testimony
of
others,
i'll
tell
you
later
why
john
messer
didn't
testify.
he
announced
to
two
members
of
the
industry,
"i,
in
view
of
the
critical
shortage
of
plate
glass
and
the
increased
demand
for
mirrors,
i'm
going
to
raise
my
price."
he
didn't
say,
"i
want
to
raise
it."
but,
"i'm
going
to
raise
it."
and,
quite
understandably,
from
this
man,
that
set
off
quite
a
discussion
among
the
members
of
the
industry
at
that
meeting.
subsequently,
a
man
named
kenneth
hearn
called
jonas
who
was
not
present
at
the
asheville
meeting
and
told
him
what
messer
had
said.
and,
we
get
the
first
evidence
advice
of
bias
of
the
witness
jonas
on
his
reply.
the
testimony
is
when
he
heard
that
on
the
telephone
he
said,
"i
wouldn't
believe
john
messer
on
anything."
the
second
evidence
of
bias
is
the
witness
is
--
comes
from
the
witness
buchan
who
said,
"jonas
was
bitter
towards
messer
because
of
the
price
war."
but
the
most
dramatic
evidence
of
this
witness'
bias
against
my
man
messer
occurred
at
the
critical
meeting
at
the
bluffs
where
jonas
precipitated
a
fight,
a
verbal
duel
with
messer
that
was
so
intense,
one
witness
said,
"i
thought
they
were
going
to
come
to
blows."
and,
the
second
witness,
that,
"i
thought
messer
was
going
to
have
a
stroke."
now,
what
is
the
testimony?
keep
in
mind
this
meeting.
there
were
only
four
people
that
are
important
that
attended
that
meeting.
one
was
john
messer,
the
other
was
grady
stroupe
of
stroupe
mirror,
the
third
was
ralph
buchan
of
carolina
mirror,
and
the
fourth
was
messer.
now,
two
of
the
witnesses,
buchan
and
stroupe,
are
in
agreement
on
what
occurred.
here's
what
they
said,
in
essence.
they
said,
first,
that
when
the
meeting
opened,
messer
restated
what
he'd
said
at
ashville
to
one
and
all,
"i'm
going
to
raise
my
price
to
78,
an
increase
of
about
10%."
at
that
point,
jonas
jumped
on
it
and,
in
effect,
doubted
his
veracity.
and,
this
terrible,
as
they
described
it
in
the
record,
hassle
between
the
two
men
occurred.
then,
after
that
had
subsided,
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
price
situation.
and
next,
finally,
when
messer,
still
thoroughly
mad,
he
said,
"all
right,
you're
going
to
all
have
to
get
out
a
letter
on
the
same
day,"
and
what
happened
then?
both
buchan
and
stroupe
said
as
follows.
stroupe
said,
"i
didn't
come
here
for
that
purpose
and
i
won't
do
it."
buchan
said,
"i
am
not
authorized
to
make
any
sort
of
an
arrangement.
i'm
here
only
as
an
observer."
he
was
a
subordinate
of
carolina.
he
was
sent
there
by
ed
gardner,
the
president
of
the
company.
and,
they
both
agree
that,
in
--
at
that
posture
of
the
events
at
the
bluff,
messer
said,
"you
can
all
go
to
hell.
i'm
going
to
78
and
the
rest
of
you
can
do
what
you
want."
now,
the
testimony
is
that
buchan
reported
that
last
and
significant
fact
to
his
superior,
gardner.
and,
gardner
had
to
deal
with
that
and
evaluate
it
as
to
what
he
would
do.
it's
significant
that
neither
buchan
nor
stroupe
testified
that
there
was
an
agreement,
but
jonas
did.
now,
i
want
to
talk
about
john
messer
again.
you've
got
to
understand
that
--
i
believe
the
court
have
got
to
understand
this
man.
john
messer
was
a
man
of
advanced
years,
i
have
stated
he
was
a
very
positive
and
assertive
man,
a
tough,
vigorous
price
competitor.
he
was
examined
extensively
by
dr.
david
c.
wilson
of
the
university
of
virginia
hospital,
a
specialist
of
neurology
and
psychiatry.
dr.
wilson
testified
that
messer
had
advanced
arteriosclerosis,
hardening
of
the
arteries
in
--
particularly
in
the
brain,
that
he'd
suffered
several
minor
strokes,
and
that
he'd
suffered,
as
is
usual
in
the
--
such
cases,
a
profound
loss
of
memory,
and
that
his
recollection
of
the
events
--
critical
events
in
this
case
at
ashville
and
at
the
bluffs
were
vague
and
unreliable.
now,
obviously,
he
was
not
put
on
the
stand,
and
i
don't
think
i
take
liberties
with
the
record,
if
i
suggest
to
this
court,
that
he
was
of
no
help
to
his
counsel
in
giving
us
the
elemental
facts
of
what
occurred
in
ashville
and
at
the
bluffs.
that
had
to
come
from
his
competitors,
including
this
man,
jonas.
now,
certainly,
i
think
it
is
abundantly
clear,
this
man
jonas,
described
by
the
government
as
a
principal
and
key
witness,
he
was.
his
bias
towards
messer,
i
have
just
described,
stands
out
in
the
record.
this
man
jonas,
i
said,
decimated
our
man.
he
did.
he
glibly
supplied
every
missing
detail
from
the
meeting
at
the
bluffs
necessary
to
support
the
government's
case
against
messer.
now,
let
me
tell
you
how
he
did
that.
he
--
jonas
testified
messer
didn't
say,
"i'm
going
to
raise
my
price."
he
said,
"i
want
to
raise
it."
when
jonas
testified
that
when
he
got
the
assurance
of
the
others
that
he
agreed
that
he
had
raised
his
price,
he
said,
"we
just
agreed
that
78
was
about
fair
and
we
went
along,"
that
they
let
messer
dictate,
sending
out
a
letter.
and,
he
significantly
did
not
remember
that,
at
the
end
of
the
meeting,
this
peppery
language
of
messer
saying,
"you
can
all
go
to
hell.
i'm
going
to
78
and
the
rest
of
you
do
what
you
want
to."
he
didn't
remember
that.
now,
buchan
testified
that
he
recalled
no
arrangements
made
at
that
meeting
at
the
bluffs
for
calling
other
participants,
the
other
mirror
companies
not
represented,
but
jonas
did.
he
tied
it
all
together.
now,
i
want
to
talk
about
--
i'm
talking
again
about
the
critical
effect
of
jonas,
this
one
man,
this
one
witness,
on
the
defense,
and
to
show
you
the
posture
in
which
we
find
jonas.
neither
jonas,
his
company,
the
lenoir
mirror
company,
nor
another
mirror
company,
a
co-defendant
not
named
as
a
defendant,
the
slane
company
which
owned
the
big
interest
in
his
company,
were
indicted.
suspect
one,
second
in
our
dilemma
of
defense
when
we
sought
to
interview
jonas,
government
counsel
instructed
him
not
to
talk
to
defense
counsel.
and,
third,
the
record
shows
jonas
testified
not
once,
as
most
of
the
others
did,
but
three
times
before
the
grand
jury
and
was
interviewed
extensively
by
government
counsel,
each
and
every
time.
now,
keep
in
mind,
there
were
no
signed
statements
that
jonas
had
given
to
the
government.
the
jencks
statute
discovery
that
was
exceeded
to
us
were
notes
and
memorandums
of
government
counsel
preparing
for
trial
to
examine
jonas.
we
knew
that
the
only
way
in
which
you
could
attack
the
credibility
of
this
key
witness
who
would
lie
in
that
grand
jury
testimony.
and,
it's
not
enough
to
say
you
could
have
cross-examined.
every
trial
lawyer
knows
that
when
you
get
a
sense
and
instinct,
don't
do
it
if
you
don't
have
the
foundation
and
let
him,
before
the
jury,
say,
"i've
told
the
truth
before
the
grand
jury
and
i've
told
it
here."
and,
at
that
point,
10
defendants,
each
for
different
reasons,
sought
from
the
trial
judge
the
testimony
of
jonas
who
stated
that
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
covered
the
same
batter
as
he
testified
to
at
the
trial.
and,
the
court
--
the
district
court
summarily
denied
it
because
he
said,
"you've
got
to
make
a
showing
of
prior
inconsistency
before
i'll
even
listen
to
it."
now,
here
was
jonas,
the
critical
witness.
certainly,
in
the
phrase
of
this
court,
it
was
one
of
particularized
need
that
we
were
faced
with."
and,
the
only
policy
against
exceeding
to
the
disclosure
we
sought
is
the
traditional
one
of
secrecy.
now,
we
believe,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
philosophy
expressed
in
jencks
and
in
the
andolscheck
case
in
the
second
circuit
by
judge
hand
is
the
correct
philosophy
that
should
have
been
applicable
under
these
facts.
we
interpret
that
philosophy
to
be
that
fullest
access
to
documents
and
material
reasonably
necessary
for
defense
be
given
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
we
believe
that
it
is
an
--
a
philosophy
of
evenhanded
justice
and
a
fair
play
in
a
criminal
case.
but
we
point
out
that
if
the
public
interest
requires
that
such
a
strict
rule
of
secrecy
of
--
be
cloaked
around
the
grand
jury,
then
we
say
that
the
government
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
a
witness
who
made
such
damaging
inroads
upon
our
defense
and
then
to
deny
us
the
means
of
impeaching
that
witness.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
after
the
witness
jonas
had
testified
in
chief
for
the
government,
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
that
is
not
his
case.
this
was
a
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
that
is
correct.
after
he
had
testified
in
chief
and,
mind
you,
if
you
read
the
record,
the
character
of
this
witness
jonas,
he's
a
skillful
and
intelligent
man.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
well,
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
put
me
in
a
role
that
i
can't
assume.
i
can
tell
you
i
was
trial
counsel
there.
my
heckles
were
out
three
feet.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
i
just
knew
this
was
a
suspect.
now,
how
he
struck
judge
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
that
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
you
concede,
there
are
two
kinds
of
notices.
i'll
agree
with
you.
now,
he
didn't,
apparently.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
because
in
--
although
we
don't
think
that,
in
the
rule
that
he
--
that
judge
paul
applied
here,
that
he
exercised
any
discretion.
i
will
develop
that
later.
he
applied,
mechanically,
a
rule
which
even
the
government
concedes
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
is
improper.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
i'd
like
to
read
that
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
no,
he
didn't
say
it
was
mechanical.
those
are
my
words.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
in
the
context
of
the
record.
now,
here's
the
way
--
this
is
on
page
259
of
the
record.
mr.
homer
carlson
was
speaking
for
all
defendants,
all
10."
then,
i
want
to
move
for
the
production
of
the
grand
jury
minutes."
the
court
"exactly
what
i
thought
you
were
and
you're
not
going
to
get
them."
mr.
homer
carlson
"we
want
to
make
the
record."
the
court
"unless
you
can
show
me
--
can
show
some
sound
basis
that
contradicts
between
what
happened
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
and
his
testimony
in
this
trial,
i'm
not
going
to
require
the
production
of
the
grand
jury
records.
it
would
be
easy
for
an
attorney
to
get
access
to
the
records
of
the
grand
jury
by
just
such
a
motion
as
you're
making
here."
now
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
i
can't
answer
that,
sir.
i
don't
know.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
but,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
point
out
that
if
he
were
pursuing
a
much
better
standard,
as
the
one
you
suggest,
sensing
that
there
was
truly
in
this
witness
something
shifty
and
unreliable,
he
didn't
apply
that.
he
didn't
say.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
well,
all
i
know
is
what
the
record
said
and
the
impact
on
us,
"unless
you
can
show,"
which
we
couldn't.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
"unless
you
show
a
contradiction
between
what
he
said
before
the
grand
jury
and
before
this
trial,
i
will
not
let
you."
mr.
h.
graham
morison
well,
may
i
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
--
in
reply
to
that,
i
think
the
most
important
thing
i
have
just
tried
to
patiently
spell
out,
the
damaging
effect
of
this
witness
on
us,
the
incidence
which
led
us
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
--
to
his
suspension
which
were
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
here's
a
man
who
had
testified
not
once
but
three
times.
that's
suspicious
to
a
trial
lawyer.
second,
here
is
a
witness
who
had
expressed
his
bias
against
the
defendant
messer,
extreme
bias,
and
he
testified
to
it
at
trial
on
direct.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
that's
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes,
sir.
well,
if
i
may
go
on,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
hope
i've
tried
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now,
we
believe,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
what
is
presented
here
is
what
is
the
appropriate
standard
that
should
be
applied
in
situations
of
this
kind,
of
--
where,
here,
a
key
government
witness
covers
the
same
matter
at
--
in
his
grand
jury
testimony
as
he
covered
at
trial,
and
it's
crucial
to
the
defense,
and
it's
relevant.
we
believe
that
that
testimony
should
be
made
available
to
the
defense
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
on
yesterday,
you
asked
counsel
for
pittsburgh
if
it's
the
defendant's
view
that
trial
judge
retained
any
discretion
in
dealing
with
requests
like
those
made
here.
well,
our
answer
is,
of
course,
we
do
believe
that
he
has
discretion
and
that
it
must
be
exercised
at
all
times
of
course.
but,
i
affirm
--
our
view,
again,
that
we
believe,
here,
that
the
trial
judge
in
denying
access
based
upon
the
standard
which
the
government
concedes
is
wrong
of
requiring
prior
inconsistencies
was
not
exercising
his
discretion.
he
was
mechanically
--
applying
a
standard.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
that
--
in
that
term.
in
the
first
place,
jencks
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
grand
juries.
the
second
thing,
of
course,
in
procter
and
gamble,
this
court
reserved
that
point.
but,
we
believe
this,
that
the
philosophy
of
fair
play,
the
philosophy
of
equal-handed
justice
that
was
annunciated
in
the
jencks
case
is
something
that
no
judge
can
ignore,
whether
it
applies
to
the
government
document
situation
or
grand
jury.
the
defendant
is
in
the
same
impossible
situation
that
he's
in.
now,
we
don't
say
that
jencks
controls
this
case.of
course
it
doesn't.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
yes,
sir.
as
i
--
i
told
the
court,
my
heckles
were
up
and
they
were
up
two-feet
long.
if
that
be
called
discretion,
it
was
not
an
exercised
discretion
that
yields
the
fair
play
that
i
think
the
federal
judicial
system
and
administration
of
criminal
law
intends.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
i
do
not,
sir.
i
--
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
review
of
discretion.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
--
what
the
court
--
mr.
h.
graham
morison
--
has
before
it
here
is
what
is
the
appropriate
standard?
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
are
many
standards
in
effect
in
the
circuits,
and
the
first
--
the
first
standard
which
the
government
concedes
is
wrong
is
the
one
exercised
by
the
trial
judge
here.
the
second
is
the
very
limited
in
camera
inspection
which
is
announced
by
the
court
below
in
this
case.
the
third
is
the
more
liberal
intermediate
inspection
granted
where
the
court
is
required
to
review
the
entire
transcript
of
grand
jury
and
trial
testimony
as
annunciated
in
spangelet.
and,
the
last,
of
course,
is
the
third
circuit's
rule
which
more
conforms
to
the
jencks
procedure.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may,
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
first
want
to
come
back,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
first
point
i
addressed
to
you.
it's
raised
again
by
government
counsel.
the
implication
seems
to
be
raised
by
my
brother
that
there
is
something
inherent
in
the
facts
in
this
case
that
would
entitle
us
to
ask
for
every
witness'
grand
jury
testimony,
and
we
have
denied
that
that's
true.
now,
a
discussion
ensued
yesterday
with
pittsburgh
counsel
about
the
ruling
in
socony-vacuum.
and,
i
want
to
compare
that
case
with
this
to
show
you
that
we
think
that
if
the
trial
judge
does
exercise
and
must
exercise
his
discretion
that
has
got
to
value
the
impact
of
the
witness
on
the
defense
in
every
case,
and
that
when
he
finds,
as
in
this
case,
that
it
was
damaging,
then,
justice
would
require
that
access
be
given.
now,
in
socony-vacuum,
what
was
the
situation?
there,
the
government's
witnesses
were
employees
of
the
defendants.
when
the
government
put
them
on
the
stand,
they
were
less
than
--
they
needed
to
be
prodded
along
and
the
government
used
the
grand
jury
transcript
to
refresh
their
recollection.
at
that
moment,
counsel
for
defense
jumped
and
said,
"now,
we
want
your
honor
to
read
all
of
these
witnesses'
grand
jury
--
all
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
into
the
record,"
and
the
judge
properly
said,
"no.
these
are
friendly
witnesses.
you
undoubtedly
have
talked
with
these
witnesses
and
they've
told
you
what
the
questions
were
before
the
grand
jury
and
what
their
answers
were."
again,
we
think
in
socony-vacuum
that
the
court
properly
exercised
that
discretion.
now,
the
government
note
that
we
--
as
they
often
do,
that
we
didn't
cross-examine
extensively.
i
adverted
to
that
earlier
by
saying
this
is
a
trial
lawyer's
judgment
in
the
forum
as
to
what
you
should
do.
we
exercised
it
one
way.
now,
this
court
will
recall
that,
in
the
palermo
case
argued
here
yesterday,
the
government
said
they
can't
have
access
to
documents
because
you
had
extensive
cross-examination.
now,
all
i
am
saying,
your
honors,
is
this.
my
brother
elman,
like
myself,
is
an
advocate.
he
seeks
to
aid
the
prosecution
and
what
he
has
said
is
to
restrict
this
in
order
that
the
prosecution
may
be
aided.
now,
this
business
about
who
raised
the
privilege,
well,
the
government
raised
the
privilege
in
this
case
of
course.
their
voice
could
hardly
be
heard,
however,
because
of
the
judge's
ruling
which
was
so
quick.
now,
coming
to
the
second
phase
of
the
question,
what
is
the
trial
judge's
discretion?
and,
i
want
to
say
it
again
that
we
believe
the
proper
standard
says
that
the
trial
judge
of
course
retains
under
6
(e)
his
discretion
in
every
phase
of
the
case
and
that
when
a
request
comes,
he
must
of
necessity,
in
the
proper
exercise
of
his
discretion,
evaluate
the
impact
of
the
government's
witness
upon
the
defense.
and,
if
he
finds,
as
here,
that
he
was
extremely
damaging,
then
we
believe
that
he
should
give
access
to
those
grand
jury
minutes
for
the
purpose
--
the
most
essential
purpose
in
criminal
jurisprudence,
to
attack
the
credibility
of
the
witness.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
again
mr.
elman
has
been
very
helpful
in
almost
a
seminar
way
in
suggesting
that
this
is
a
difficult
problem
of
the
public
interest
of
weighing
and
balancing.
we
concede
that
it
is,
but
we
don't
think
that
advances
the
situation
to
simply
say
that
there
must
be
some
inherent
change
in
6
(e)
that
calls
for
congress
and
great
convening
of
jurors
to
decide
it.
we
believe
that
this
is
something
that
this
court
has
had
to
decide
over
and
over,
and
over
again.
what
are
the
proper
standards
in
fair
play
in
justice
that
must
be
applied
as
a
guide
to
the
courts
to
see
that
justice
is
done?
now,
i'd
like
mr.
chief
justice
to
note
the
impact
of
the
court
below's
standards,
if
i
may.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
just
briefly,
sir.
mr.
h.
graham
morison
we'd
like
to
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
court
below,
noting
that
the
judge
had
applied
this
improper
standard
of
prior
inconsistency,
they
nevertheless
sustained
him
on
the
basis
that
we
had
not
specifically
requested
in
camera
inspection.
but,
whether
that
was
an
error
or
not,
certainly
the
prejudice
of
this
defendant
should
not
be
permitted
to
continue.
and,
i
challenge
this
thing
that
the
dogs
might
sleep
at
night.
i
have
never
seen
the
grand
jury
testimony.
the
trial
judge
has
never
seen
it.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fourth
circuit
has
never
seen
it.
and
this
court
has
never
seen
it.
and,
i
submit
your
honors,
let
us
suppose,
as
suppose
we
must,
that
in
three
days
of
grand
jury
testimony,
there
is
exculpatory
material
helpful
in
clarifying
the
search
for
truth
for
this
defendant
messer
who
could
not
speak
for
himself.
that's
the
problem.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
in
dealing
with
that
has
rejected
the
third
circuit's
rule
in
the
--
in
rosenberg.
it
has
adopted
a
rule
and
the
government
seeks
this
court
to
support
a
rule
which
modifies
the
more
intermediate
second
circuit
rule,
as
in
spangelet,
in
these
respects.
first,
the
trial
judge
is
not
required
to
make
any
inspection.
second,
if
he
does
make
an
inspection,
it
must
be
limited
to
particular
points,
sharply
in
issue.
and
third,
even
if
the
judge
does
find
an
inconsistency,
he
is
not
required
to
reveal
it
if
he
believes
it
to
be
inconsequential.
and
we
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
means
that
there
will
never
be
inspection.
thank
you,
sir.
