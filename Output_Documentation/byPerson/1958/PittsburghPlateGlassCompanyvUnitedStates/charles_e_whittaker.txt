hazard,
may
i
ask
you
how
you
square
your
argument
with
rule
6
of
criminal

in
denying
the
request
which
you
say
you
have
a
right
to
make,
i
--
i
think
i
understand
you
to
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
abuses
his
discretion
when
he
refuses
it?

do
you
not
consider
the
words
“may
be
--
may
--
that
is
a
delivery
may
be
made
only
when
so
directed
by
the
court
as
--
this
first
starts
out
saying
“disclosure
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
other
than
its
deliberations,”
etcetera,
“may
be
made
then
only
when
so
directed
by
the
court.”

then
say
that
gives
the
court
a
discretion
to
do
it?

e.
whittaker
