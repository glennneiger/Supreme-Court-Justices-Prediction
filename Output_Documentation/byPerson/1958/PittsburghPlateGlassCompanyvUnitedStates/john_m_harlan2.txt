justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
position
go
so
far
as
to
say
that,
in
every
case
where
the
government
has
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
calls
a
witness
to
testify,
that
the
defendants
in
an
antitrust
case
should
be
entitled
to
grand
jury
minutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and,
it
would,
i
suppose,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
read
the
statute
and
read
--
certainly,
the
statute
is
not
as
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
doing
away
with
the
traditional
rule
of
secrecy
in
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
this
extent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
hazard.
you
don't
stand
on
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
stand
on
jencks?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
not
your
basic
contention
here
that
jencks
has
made
an
incursion
into
the
traditional
rule
regarding
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
minutes?
isn't
that
the
basic
position
of
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
you
would
have
been
up
here
if
jencks
hadn't
come
down?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
your
argument
is,
this
is
a
pure
question
of
whether
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
request
that
the
judge
himself
should
look
at
the
grand
jury
minutes?
no,
sir,
there
was
not
and
judge
sobeloff,
in
his
opinion
below,
points
that
out.
on
page
855,
he
says,
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
"the
defendants
at
no
time
requested
the
judge
to
make
a
preliminary
inspection
of
the
transcript
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
inconsistency.
on
the
contrary,
they
insist
that
they
and
not
the
trial
judge
are
to
determine
the
existence
well-known
of
inconsistency."
they
rely
on
rosenberg
and
jencks.
that's
the
issue
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless
the
practice
has
changed,
in
theory
at
least.
i
was
trying
the
cases
there,
you
just
couldn't
go
in
and
say,
"judge,
i'd
like
to
have
you
look
at
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
see
if
there
is
some
inconsistencies."
you
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
persuasive
showing
that
would
move
the
judge
to
undertake
that
job.
i
don't
think
judge
frankfurter
is
being
difficult
in
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
can
without
--
i'm
interrupting
you,
mr.
hazard.
