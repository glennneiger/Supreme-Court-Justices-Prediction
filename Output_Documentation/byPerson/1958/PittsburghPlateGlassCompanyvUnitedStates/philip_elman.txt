mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
the
reason
why
the
petitioners
do
not
stand
on
the
jencks
statute
is
clear
from
the
terms
of
the
statute,
as
well
as
the
legislative
history.
the
statute
refers
to
statements
made
to
an
agent
of
the
government.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
all
the
legislators
made
the
courts
recognize
that
a
grand
jury
is
not
an
agent
of
the
government
and,
for
that
reason,
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
statute
is
irrelevant.
we
do
not
believe
the
statute
is
irrelevant,
but
we
do
not
rely
on
it
as
the
source
for
our
position.
if
i
may
begin
by
stating
what
we
believe
to
be
the
issue
presented
for
decision
by
the
court,
the
only
issue
that's
presented
by
the
record
in
this
case,
the
only
issue
that
was
tendered
to
judge
paul
who
tried
the
case,
the
only
issue
which
he
decided,
the
only
issue
that
was
considered
and
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
this.
whether,
in
a
criminal
case,
after
a
witness
for
the
government
has
concluded
his
direct
examination,
and
it
appears
that
that
witness
has
testified
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
same
general
subject
matter,
whether,
for
that
reason,
and
for
that
reason
alone,
the
defendant
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right,
and
not
as
a
matter
addressed
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
but
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
right,
to
delivery
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
of
that
witness'
testimony
directly
to
the
defendant
without
any
prior
inspection
or
examination
of
any
kind
by
the
judge.
and,
wether
he's
entitled
to
all
of
the
testimony
given
by
that
witness,
rather
than
to
any
particular
selected
portions
indicated
by
the
defendant.
that
was
the
motion
that
was
made
by
the
defense
counsel
in
this
case.
it
appears
in
the
record,
pages
263
and
264.
mr.
jonas
was
an
important
witness
for
the
government.
he
was
characterized
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
principal
witness
for
the
prosecution,
but
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
he
was
the
only
important
or
principal
witness
for
the
government.
the
government
case
here
was
presented
on
a
basis
of
testimony
given
by
officials,
employees
of
the
defendant
corporations.
and,
their
testimony,
as
i
hope
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate,
corroborated
in
every
important
particular
in
mr.
jonas'
testimony,
but
mr.
jonas
was,
as
i
say,
an
important,
if
not
perhaps
the
most
important,
of
the
government
witnesses.
he
had
given
testimony
in
expressed
terms
as
to
the
formation
of
a
price-fixing
conspiracy
and
as
to
the
existence
of
an
agreement.
the
other
witnesses,
while
they
had
presented
testimony
as
to
the
meetings,
as
to
the
discussions,
as
to
the
price,
as
to
the
participation
of
the
defendants,
as
to
the
issuance
of
identical
letters
by
them
to
their
customers
as
to
the
prices,
they
had
not
used
the
word
“agreement”.
and,
mr.
jonas
had
and,
for
that
reason,
as
i
say,
he
was
an
--
he
was
a
very
--
he
was
a
key
witness.
and,
on
--
on
page
263,
after
he
had
concluded
the
direct
examination
he
was
asked
by
--
on
cross-examination,
whether
he
had
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
given
testimony
on
the
same
general
subject
matter,
he
said,
“yes,
three
times.”

mr.
humrickhouse,
who
was
trial
counsel
for
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
“now,
your
honor,
i
move
for
the
formal
production
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
for
this
witness'
testimony.”
“the
motion
is
denied.”
that
is
on
mr.
jonas.
mr.
philip
elman
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
was
not.
now,
the
basis
for
that
motion,
the
groundwork
for
it
had
been
laid
a
few
minutes
earlier
in
a
colloquy
between
court
and
counsel
that
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
258
of
the
record.
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
defendant
should
receive
certain
government
papers.
and
mr.
humrickhouse,
at
the
bottom
of
page
258,
said,
“your
honor,
we
would
like
to
call
mr.
jonas
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
and
ask
him
two
or
three
questions
going
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury.”
the
court,
“what
do
you
want
to
ask
him?”
“i
want
to
ask
him
did
he
testify
before
the
grand
jury
in
roanoke
in
december
of
1956
and
january
--
february
or
march
of
1957,
how
many
times
did
he
testify
before
the
grand
jury,
and
so
on.”
and,
the
court,
this
is
--
this
is
in
the
middle
of
page
259,
judge
paul
says
“i
thought
--
exactly
what
i
thought
you
were
going
to
do,
move
for
the
production
of
the
grand
jury
minutes,
and
you
are
not
going
to
get
them.”
mr.
humrickhouse,
“we
want
to
make
the
record.”
and,
the
court
goes
on
and
--
and
says
that
if
they
could
get
mr.
jonas'
testimony
here,
“you
can
--
i'm
reading
now
from
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“you
can
do
that
for
each
witness
and
get
a
complete
transcript
of
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
and
that
is
not
permissible.”
now,
the
starting
point
in
this
case
is
a
proposition
upon
which
the
petitioners
and
the
government
are
in
complete
accord.
there
is
not
disagreement
that
the
matter
here
is
governed
here
by
rule
6
(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
promulgated
by
this
court
in
1946,
after
submission
to
congress.
it
is
also
common
ground
between
us
that,
prior
to
june
3,
1957,
when
this
court
delivered
the
decision
in
the
jencks
case,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
no
court
had
ever
decided
or
even
seriously
suggested
that
a
motion
of
this
sort
for
automatic
delivery
to
the
defense
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
given
by
a
government
witness
should
be
granted
simply
on
the
ground
that
the
witness
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
same
subject
matter.
and,
for
that
reason,
that
there
might
possibly
be
some
prior
inconsistencies
which
could
be
used
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
prior
to
the
jencks
decision,
it
was
the
law,
as
clear
as
any
proposition
has
ever
been
the
law,
that
the
principle
of
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings
in
this
regard
was
go
--
was
controlling
and
that
the
defendant
could
not
lift
that
secrecy
for
that
purpose.
and,
the
argument
which
is
made
here
today
is
that
the
jencks
decision
changed
that
and
we
--
the
government's
position,
in
response,
can
be
summarized
very
briefly.
we
think
that
the
jencks
decision
does
not
deal
with
grand
jury
testimony.
we
think
that
when
congress,
shortly
after
the
jencks
decision,
dealt
with
this
problem,
it
--
evidence
to
recognition
on
both
sides,
both
the
proponents
of
a
broad
disclosure
rule
and
the
proponents
of
a
narrow
disclosure
rule,
were
united
in
their
view
that
the
jencks
case
had
--
did
not
deal
with
grand
jury
transcripts.
those
who
opposed
the
legislation
or
argue
that
there
was
no
reason
for
it
because
jencks
didn't
deal
with
grand
jury
transcripts
and
that
the
fears
as
to
the
abuse
and
the
lengths
to
which
the
decision
might
be
applied
were
grounders.
those
who
argued
for
the
legislation
in
congress
pointed
to
the
rosenberg
case
which,
incidentally,
was
the
case
immediately
be
--
argued
before
this
one.
the
rosenburg
decision
in
the
third
circuit,
in
--
late
in
june
of
1957,
within
a
few
weeks
after
this
court's
decision
in
jencks,
the
third
circuit,
in
a
short
per
curiam,
had
held
that
grand
jury
minutes,
as
well
as
the
statements
of
the
witness
meyer
and
dirks
in
the
preceding
case
should
have
been
turned
over
to
the
defense.
and,
that
was
pointed
to
as
a
horrible
example
of
lower
court
misconstruction
of
the
jencks
case
which
ne
--
which
called
congressional
delimitation
of
the
scope
of
jencks.
so
that,
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
understood
that
the
jencks
decision
did
not
extend
to
the
production
of
grand
jury
minutes.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
that
was
the
reason
why
no
--
nothing
was
included
in
the
statute
to
deal
with
it
and,
if
the
petitioners
are
right
in
their
contention
that
they
are
entitled
to
this
automatic
delivery
without
judicial
inspection,
without
any
sort
of
screening
by
the
judge
in
the
elimination
of
irrelevant
matter,
the
elimination
of
matter
referring
to
innocent
third
persons,
matter
containing
questions
asked
by
the
grand
jurors,
and
so
on,
they
just
get
it
all
intact,
you
will
have
the
anomalous
result.
the
grand
jury
minutes
which
have
always
been
regarded
is
entitled
to
the
highest
degree
of
protection
from
disclosure
will
be
in
--
will
have
less
protection
than
statements
made
to
the
f.b.i.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir,
certainly,
and
it's
available
to
the
government
because
rule
6
(e),
in
its
first
sentence,
specifically
said
that
they
shall
be
used
by
government.
this
court,
in
the
rule,
has
affirmatively
provided
that
the
--
that
this
--
that
the
attorneys
for
the
government,
for
the
use
in
the
performance
of
their
duties,
shall
have
the
right
to
use
the
grand
jury
minutes.
now,
that
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
secrecy
explicitly
provided
by
the
court
in
its
rules
and
the
reason,
of
course,
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
by
the
court
and
the
congress.
and
--
and
while
--
while
i'm
on
that
point,
mr.
justice,
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
rule
is,
to
our
minds,
of
great
importance.
this
court,
yesterday,
in
the
isthmian
case,
was
also
dealing
with
a
rule.
that
happened
to
be
an
admiralty
rule.
and,
the
--
it
would
had
--
it
was
argued
to
the
court
there
that
the
rule
was
archaic,
that
it
was
inflexible,
that
perhaps
it
should
be
changed.
and,
the
court
recognized
that,
perhaps,
that
might
be
so,
but
the
court
said
--
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
it
said
if
the
rule
is
to
be
changed,
it
ought
to
be
changed
either
by
legislation
or
by
an
amendment
to
the
rule,
and
the
change
should
not
be
made
in
the
decisional
process.
and
the
--
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
if
the
change
were
made
in
the
context
of
an
amendment
to
the
rule,
it
would
be
opportunity
for
hearings,
for
receiving
data,
and
perhaps,
more
important
than
anything
else,
for
receiving
the
recommendations
of
the
judicial
conference.
there
are
arguments
that
are
being
made
here
as
if
there
was
--
this
were
a
de
novo
proposition
that
if
we
should
reexamine
for
the
first
time
the
question
whether
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
is
or
is
not
a
good
thing,
whether
it
hurts
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
my
first
response
--
mr.
philip
elman
my
first
response,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
these
aren't
new
arguments.
these
arguments
have
been
made
before.
they
were
--
they've
been
made
by
eminent
scholars.
professor
wigmore
is,
perhaps,
the
most
eminent
proponent
of
that
view.
if
professor
wigmore
is
right,
then
this
court's
decision
in
the
socony-vacuum
case
is
wrong.
if
he
is
right,
then
this
court's
decision
in
the
johnson
case
is
wrong.
if
he
is
right,
the
decision
in
procter
and
gamble
case
is
wrong
because,
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
grand
jury's
function
had
terminated.
if
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
is
a
temporary
provisional
thing,
as
professor
wigmore
argues,
then
there
was
certainly
no
reason
for
it
to
be
continued.
but,
if
i
may
go,
it
isn't
--
mr.
philip
elman
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
my
--
my
argument
on
that
point
is
this.
i
--
i
am
very
conscious
of
the
fact
that
this
problem
is
not
a
new
one.
it's
a
problem
that
has
existed,
certainly,
ever
since
the
institution
of
the
grand
jury,
which
goes
back
to
before
the
norman
conquest.
i'm
very
conscious
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
addressed
itself
many
times
to
the
broad
proposition
of
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
whether,
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
logic,
it's
desirable
to
continue
it.
and,
the
court
has
always
rejected
any
attempt
to
violate
the
principle.
in
the
--
in
the
johnson
case,
there's
reference
made
to
the
indispensible
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury.
in
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
in
the
costello
case,
he
refers
to
the
grand
jury
as
part
of
our
federal
constitutional
system.
it's
a
--
it
was
put
--
it's
explicitly
referred
to
in
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
--
as
the
initial
step
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
it's
there
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
government,
but
it's
there
for
the
benefit
of
the
accused
because
our
history
is
full
of
instances
where
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury
has
been
an
obstacle,
a
barrier
against
unfounded
prosecution.
now,
i'm
conscious
of
the
fact
that
our
greatest
judges,
judges
with
the
most
intimate
experience
with
this
problem,
such
as
judge
augustus
hand,
the
judge
learned
hand,
whenever
they've
talked
about
the
grand
jury,
they've
expressed
horror
at
the
thought
that
--
one
might
be
able
to
inspect
grand
jury
minutes
freely.
now,
it's
against
that
background
of
centuries
of
history
that
we
consider
these
contentions
that
are
being
made.
now,
if
--
as
a
matter
of
abstract
theory,
if
we
were
sitting
in
a
room
where
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
the
grand
jury
and
someone
said
“let's
establish
this
and
organize
an
institution
called
the
grand
jury,”
what
about
the
matter
of
secrecy?
i
--
i
agree
that
there
are
weighty
arguments
to
be
made
on
both
sides
of
the
proposition,
but
those
arguments
have
been
--
had
been
weighed.
they
have
been
resolved,
and
rule
6
(e)
has
resolved
them.
and,
rule
6
(e)
didn't
me
--
introduce
anything
new.
as
i
say,
it's
--
this
is
old
law.
and,
certainly,
it's
surprising
to
us
to
find
that,
in
1959,
it's
argued
--
this
point
is
being
argued
to
your
honors
as
if
it
were
a
new
one
and
that
the
jencks
case,
somehow,
had
wiped
the
slate
entirely
clean
and
that
we
start
form
scratch.
mr.
philip
elman
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
hasten
to
embrace
your
suggestion.
of
course,
there
--
of
course,
the
history
has
--
is
relevant
here
not
simply
as
a
matter
of
history
because
it
show
--
but
it's
relevant
here
to
show
that
these
arguments
which
--
have
been
weighed
and
they've
been
rejected.
and,
the
reason
they
have
been
rejected
is
that
it's
been
considered
essential
to
the
functioning
of
a
grand
jury
as
an
institution
that
it
be
able
to
operate
without
the
--
without
publicity,
that
the
jurors,
as
well
as
the
witnesses,
be
free
from
any
possible
restraints
or
intimidation
or
inhibitions.
we
know
that
anti
--
in
the
antitrust
cases,
particularly,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
last
year
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case,
the
witness
is
before
the
grand
jury
may
be
employees
of
the
defendants,
they
may
be
customers,
they
may
be
suppliers,
they
may
be
other
people
to
whom
it's
important
to
maintain
good
friendly
economic
relations.
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
suggestion
is
that,
once
the
witness
testifies
at
the
trial,
his
identity
has
been
disclosed.
so,
it's
all
out
in
the
public
and
either
he
has
--
either
his
testimony
is
the
same
as
it
was
before
the
grand
jury,
in
which
case,
there's
nothing
new,
or
else,
it's
different,
in
which
case,
he
must
have
testified
falsely
one
place
or
the
other.
now,
that,
i
say
with
all
respect
to
professor
wigmore
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
is
false
--
i
mean
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that
there
may
be,
let's
use
a
neutral
word
like
“discrepancies”
or
“inconsistencies.”
now,
that,
i
say
with
--
with
all
respect
to
the
proponents
of
the
view,
creates
a
false
dichotomy.
it
assumes
--
it
assumes
a
--
a
notion.
it
assumes
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
something
different
from
what
they
actually
are.
now,
the
--
the
basic
characteristic
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding
is
that
it
is
not
--
it's
not
a
proceeding
in
which
a
judge
presides.
it's
a
proceeding
--
proceeding
which
is
informal
in
nature.
it's
a
--
there
are
laymen,
23
jurors,
drawn
from
the
community.
it's
an
informal
proceeding.
it's
not
--
it's
not
an
adjudicatory
proceeding.
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
it's
an
inquisitorial
investigative
body.
and
--
and
it's
--
and
those
who
appeared
before
grand
juries,
those
who
are
familiar
with
grand
juries
--
jury
operations
have
always
remarked
on
the
importance
of
preserving
the
informal,
free,
and
easy
atmosphere
of
the
grand
jury
in
which
witnesses
are
not
bound
by
the
technical
rules
of
evidence.
they
may
speculate.
they
may
--
they
may
testify
as
to
hearsay.
they
may
test
--
they
may
present
rumors,
anything
that
will
give
the
grand
jury
leads
in
its
investigation,
so
that,
you
can't
compare
the
testimony
of
the
witness
at
the
trial
--
mr.
philip
elman
oh,
there
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
don't
think
that
i'll
be
able
to
present
every
argument
that
can
be
made
in
support
of
secrecy
within
the
time
available,
but
i
do
think
that
all
of
these
arguments
that
had
been
made
against
secrecy
have
been
considered
by
the
courts.
mr.
philip
elman
and
have
been
rejected.
mr.
philip
elman
of
course
another
difference
is
that,
in
the
federal
judicial
system,
the
grand
jury
is
expressly
provided
for
by
the
bill
of
rights.
it's
part
of
our
constitutional
system
for
trying
criminal
cases.
that's
not
true
in
the
states.
in
many
states,
grand
juries
have
either
been
abolished
or
is
trial
by
information.
in
some
states,
i
believe,
california
is
one
of
them,
it's
--
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that
the
defendant
may
get
the
grand
jury
transcript
simply
by
paying
for
it.
in
new
york
--
in
new
york,
there's
the
--
new
york
adopted
the
arguments
which
were
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
costello
case.
in
new
york,
defendant
may
challenge
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
to
justify
the
indictment.
so,
in
new
york,
in
order
to
permit
a
defendant
to
make
that
kind
of
an
argument,
they
are
very
liberal
in
giving
him
access
to
the
grand
jury
minutes.
and,
i
think
that,
to
some
extent,
explains
the
liberality
of
the
second
circuit
rule
as
to
the
inspection
of
grand
jury
minutes.
i
think
there's
been
an
influence
of
the
state
practice
in
this
respect.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
point
out,
in
that
regard,
that
the
fourth
circuit
in
its
opinion
here,
opinion
by
chief
judge
sobeloff,
did
not
deal
with
this
problem
in
terms
of
absolutes.
judge
sobeloff
did
not
say
that
the
defendant
never
gets
an
opportunity
to
inspect
the
grand
jury
minutes.
the
--
the
court
recognized
that
we're
dealing
here
with
two
very
important
interests.
interests
that
are
of
concern
to
both
sides,
to
the
government,
as
well
as
to
the
accused.
the
interest
of
a
defendant
in
having
a
fair
trial,
the
interest
of
a
defendant
in
having
fair
opportunity
for
cross-examination,
that's
of
concern
to
the
government,
too,
as
well
as
the
accused.
and,
the
interest
of
the
--
and,
the
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity,
the
independence,
the
efficiency
of
the
grand
jury,
well,
that's
not
merely
of
concern
to
the
government.
that's
of
vital
concern
to
defendants,
to
the
accused,
to
have
that
kind
of
an
institution
and,
because
it's
a
question
of
balancing
two
principles,
two
interests,
accommodating
each
as
much
as
possible
to
the
other,
that
judge
swan
in
the
alper
case,
the
leading
case
in
the
second
circuit
and
judge
sobeloff
here
said
it's
dangerous
to
lay
down
any
fixed
rules.
that,
ultimately,
it's
--
it
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
a
sound
judicial
discretion
that
a
trial
judge
is
always
under
a
duty
to
examine
the
grand
jury
minutes
if
he
has
any
reason
at
all
to
suspect
that
the
witness
may
be
unreliable,
that
he
may
be
untrustworthy,
that
he
may
be
giving
testimony
which
is
at
variance
with
what
he
testified
elsewhere.
the
trial
judge
is
always
under
that
obligation
and
he
cannot
escape
it.
he
--
the
trial
judge
always
has,
in
the
courtroom,
the
prosecutor
who
has
those
grand
mi
--
who
has
seen
the
grand
jury
minutes.
and,
if
the
court
so
desires,
it
can
call
upon
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
philip
elman
for
assistance
in
that
regard.
mr.
philip
elman
certainly.
mr.
philip
elman
certainly.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
as
the
court
below
characterizes,
there's
a
motion
for
automatic
delivery
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
on
demand.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
argument
here
is
that
jonas'
testimony
as
to
the
telephone
calls
of
this
man
prichard
in
pittsburgh
were
crucial.
they
link
ppg
to
the
conspiracy.
we
disagree.
in
our
brief,
we
argue
that
was
not
a
crucial
part.
mr.
philip
elman
and,
the
judge
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
judge
--
judge
paul
agreed
with
us
on
it,
but
passing
that.
assuming
it
was
a
crucial
part
--
portion
of
jonas'
testimony,
we
think
it's
significant
in
here
that
he
wasn't
cross-examined
by
the
defense
as
to
that.
there
was
no
cross-examination
whatsoever.
if
there
had
been
cross-examination,
conceivably,
jonas
might
have
been
caught
in
some
inconsistencies.
going
beyond
that,
supposed
they
have
asked
jonas
whether
he
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
as
to
these
telephone
calls.
suppose
jonas
had
said
“well,
i
don't
remember,”
and
they
pursued
that
a
little
further
and
they
found
out
that
he
was
really
very
vague
as
to
what
his
recollection
had
been
six
months
earlier,
or
suppose
they
asked
him
if
he
--
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
as
to
this
thing
was
exactly
the
same
and
he
said
“well,
no.
frankly,
i
don't
think
so.
i've
--
i've
checked
my
records
lately
and
i
find
that
i
did
make
these
calls
but
when
i
was
before
the
grand
jury,
i
testified
otherwise.”
now,
if
you
had
any
basis
at
all,
anything
at
all,
you
--
mr.
philip
elman
go
to
the
judge.
mr.
philip
elman
exactly
what
the
court
was
talking
about
last
year
in
procter
and
gamble.
if
there's
a
--
that
there's
a
particularized
need.
in
procter
and
gambler,
the
court
said
“we'll
breach
the
secrecy
if
there's
compelling
necessity,
but
you
have
to
make
a
showing.
you
just
can't
say
this
man
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
that's
enough.”
now
--
excuse
me,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
--
we
believe
that
there
--
if
there
are
any
circumstances
which
would
afford
any
basis
at
all
for
an
argument
to
the
judge,
“please
exercise
your
discretion.
take
a
look
at
this
grand
jury
minutes.
if
you
find
anything
at
all
that
we
can
use
as
a
basis
for
cross-examination
of
this
witness,
we
think
we
ought
to
have
them.”
i
think
that
--
that's
the
way
they
go
about
it.
now,
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
wait
for
that.
i
think
the
judge,
if
he
looks
at
this
witness
and
he
has
a
feeling
that
this
man
just
isn't
telling
a
very
convincing
story,
or
suppose
jonas's
testimony
was
contradicted
by
another
witness
that
the
judge
believed,
the
judge
might
say,
“well,
i
think,
in
my
exercise
of
my
responsibility
here
to
preside
over
the
trial
and
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
defendant,
i
think
i
ought
to
look
at
the
in
--
the
grand
jury
minutes.”
now,
i
think
if
this
court
declares
that
it's
his
duty,
he
will
do
so.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
it
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
that
was
judge
swan.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
it
was.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
not
only
the
remington
--
mr.
philip
elman
not
only
the
remington
case
in
the
second
circuit,
but
the
rose
case
in
the
third
circuit.
may
--
may
i,
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
elman
in
the
herzog
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
all
hold
that
where
it
appears
that
the
defendant
has
told
a
different
story,
not
necessarily
an
inconsistent
one
but
a
different
story,
then
the
defendant
does
have
the
right
to
get
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
rose
case
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
referred
to,
the
remington
case
is,
the
herzog
case
is
226
f.2d
561.
i
believe
it's
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
226
f.2d
561,
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case,
and
that
is
not
the
only
instance
in
which
the
defendant
may
get
the
grand
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
i
don't
believe
they
are
all
reversals.
mr.
philip
elman
they
were
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
rose
case
was,
but
that
the
herzog
case
was
an
affirmance
but
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
that
was
a
proper
--
mr.
philip
elman
situation
for
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes
and,
of
course,
the
defendant
--
then,
it
may
get
the
grand
jury
transcript
where
he's
challenging
the
regularity
of
the
proceeding
--
mr.
philip
elman
before
the
grand
jury.
if
he
says
an
unauthorized
person
was
present,
for
example,
there,
he
may
get
it
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right,
but
that
turned
on
the
nature
of
the
matters
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
before
the
grand
jury.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
elman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
if
there
are
two
points
that
standout
very
clearly
from
this
record,
they
are
these.
first,
that
though
jonas
was
an
important
witness
for
the
government,
the
government
had
a
case
without
him,
that
the
government's
case,
based
upon
the
testimony
of
employees
of
defendant
corporations
was
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
entirely
without
jonas,
that
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses,
hostile
to
the
government,
substantially
corroborated
jonas'
testimony
on
every
point.
second,
the
second
observation
as
to
the
facts
in
the
record
which
i
think
should
be
made
here
is
that
the
arguments
as
to
the
need
for
just
jonas'
testimony
that
he
was
a
key
witness,
he
devastated
the
defense,
that
he
hadn't
been
indicted
himself,
that
he
was
suspect.
all
these
arguments
which
are
really
addressed
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
inspection
or
production
should
be
made,
those
arguments
were
not
made
in
the
trial
court.
that
issue
was
not
tendered
to
judge
paul.
it
was
not
argued
to
judge
paul
that
there
was
something
special
about
jonas
that
required
that
his
grand
jury
testimony
be
presented.
now,
let
me
document
these
general
assertions
that
i've
made.
first,
as
to
jonas'
testimony
being
substantially
corroborated,
my
first
reference
shall
be
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
the
record
at
page
854,
judge
sobeloff,
dealing
with
the
argument
that
the
trial
court
should
have
given
an
instruction
as
to
jonas'
testimony
being
received
with
caution
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
was
an
accomplice
or
conspirator,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
record
854,
judge
sobeloff
says,
"moreover,
jonas'
testimony
was,
in
many
respects,
corroborated
by
other
witnesses."
that
statement
does
not
go
as
far
as
some
of
the
statements
made
by
judge
paul
who
heard
the
testimony
and
presided
over
this
case.
i
should
like
to
refer,
first,
to
page
414
of
the
record.
there,
in
the
colloquy
between
the
court
and
defense
counsel,
defense
counsel
asked
judge
paul
to
give
this
instruction
to
the
jury
that
the
uncorroborated
statement
of
a
--
of
a
--
of
a
conspirator
isn't
enough.
the
court,
this
is
about
a-third
of
the
page
down,
"there
are
uncorroborated
statements
by
every
witness
in
here
as
to
certain
things.
there
is
certainly
corroboration
for
involving
all
these
parties
in
this
conspiracy
without
the
testimony
of
mr.
jonas."
i
asked
the
court,
too,
to
turn
to
page
422
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
which
is
a
continuation
of
the
same
colloquy.
here,
they're
referring
to
the
testimony
of
jonas
as
an
accomplice
and
they
wanted
special
instruction
as
to
that.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
judge
paul
says,
"in
this
case,
the
testimony
of
mr.
jonas
is
not
only
not
uncorroborated,
but
it
is
strongly
corroborated
by
the
officials,
or
at
least
the
employees
of
the
defendant
companies
themselves.
further
than
that,
there
is
no
denial
whatever
of
mr.
justice
as
to
jonas'
testimony
so
far
as
i
can
recollect."
then,
over
in
the
next
page,
there's
a
discussion
of
as
to
--
between
pittsburgh's
counsel
as
to
these
--
the
inconsistency
as
--
between
jonas'
testimony
as
to
these
telephone
calls
to
mr.
prichard
in
pittsburgh.
and,
the
court
says,
"that's
the
only
instance
i
can
recollect
in
which
his
testimony
was
denied,"
and
he
thinks
that's
completely
out
of
the
case
because
mr.
gordon
who
is
the
individual
official
of
pittsburgh
who
was
tried
here,
judge
paul
has
directed
his
acquittal.
judge
paul
thought
that
inconsistency
was
out
of
the
case.
now,
that's
page
422,
if
i
may
impose
on
the
court
still
further,
page
471,
these
are
the
actual
instructions
to
the
jury
given
by
judge
paul
and
he's
referring
to
jonas'
testimony
there.
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
471,
he
says,
"i
am
--,"
you
see,
it's
referring
to
the
attacks
that
were
made
on
jonas'
testimony
during
the
closing
arguments.
he
says,
"i
am
frank
to
say,
i
did
not
see
anything
in
mr.
jonas'
testimony
that
was
any
worse
or
as
bad
as
what
mr.
messer's
own
counsel
said
about
him
in
the
opening
statement
when
he
said
that
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
price-cutter
and
a
double-crosser."
and,
i
think
it
is
not
improper
to
say
that
mr.
jonas'
testimony
is
in
no
way
denied
in
any
substantial
particular.
i'm
not
vouching
for
his
testimony
nor
am
i
a
part
as
to
mr.
jonas.
he
says
the
attack
on
him
was
about
justification
of
the
evidence.
in
the
second
paragraph
there,
he
says
his
testimony
was
corroborated
by
mr.
stroupe.
now,
mr.
stroupe
was
the
--
was
the
president
of
the
stroupe
mirror
company,
one
of
the
defendants
here.
and,
he
says,
"i
think
you're
entitled
to
consider
that
fact."
and
he
points
out
the
strains
that
mr.
hearn,
who
was
one
of
the
active
participants
in
this
conspiracy,
was
not
called
here.
now,
that's
judge
paul's
version
of
the
facts.
that's
judge
--
that's
the
court
of
appeals'
version
of
the
facts
as
to
jonas'
testimony.
and
then,
we
have
the
question
of
whether
this
motion
for
the
production
of
the
grand
jury
testimony,
which
was
made
to
judge
paul,
it
was
addressed
to
his
discretion,
whether
it
made
the
arguments
that
mr.
morrison
has
made
here
this
morning,
and
the
answer
to
that
appears
very
clearly
in
the
record,
263
and
264,
the
motion
is
for
the
production
of
mr.
jonas'
testimony.
there
are
no
reasons
given
for
it
on
the
ground
that
jonas
is
crucial
but
his
testimony
is
suspect,
and
so
on.
mr.
morison
has
referred
your
honors
to
the
colloquy
on
page
259.
well,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
there,
mr.
homer
carlson,
speaking
for
all
the
defense
counsels
says,
"we
want
a
transcript
of
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
regarding
the
subjects
to
which
he,
jonas,
has
testified
on
direct
examination."
the
court
"exactly,
and
you
can
do
that
for
each
witness
and
you
get
a
complete
transcript
of
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
and
that
is
not
permissible."
now,
what
was
the
response
for
that?
was
the
response,
"well,
jonas
is
unique
and
he's
a
crucial
witness?
no."
the
answer
--
their
response
to
that,
on
the
next
page
was,
"well,
we're
relying
on
the
jencks
case.
we're
relying
on
the
rosenberg
case.and
once
a
witness
has
testified,
once
the
grand
jury
has
returned
its
indictment,
the
secrecy
reason
fades
into
a
mist."
that's
on
the
bottom
of
page
260
of
the
record.
now,
that's
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
district
court
and
it
is
argued
here
that
that
was
--
it
was
reversible
error
on
the
basis
of
that
showing
for
judge
paul
to
deny
the
motions.
mr.
philip
elman
sir
--
i
believe,
sir,
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
made
the
arguments
that
they
are
making
here.
conceivably,
although
i
--
from
my
reading
of
this
record,
i
doubt
it
very
much,
conceivably,
had
they
said
to
judge
paul,
"we
think
that
there's
--
the
circumstances
here
are
such
in
view
of
the
fact
that
jonas
wasn't
indicted,"
and
so
on,
"that
we
think
that
we
have
made
enough
of
a
showing
to
justify
you,
to
--
in
exercising
a
discretion,
to
inspect
yourself."
i
think
that
would
have
raised
a
different
issue.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
all
fairness
--
mr.
philip
elman
you
do
not
have
it
and
i
have
not
seen
it.
i
don't
know
what's
in
it.
mr.
philip
elman
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
second
--
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
second
circuit
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
in
this
regard.
it's
--
that
the
point
of
conflict
is
not
presented
by
this
case
because
there
was
no
request
to
inspect
by
the
judge
but,
in
the
second
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
the
government
believes
the
practice
to
be
on
a
basis
of
--
particularly
of
judge
frank's
--
general
frank's
opinion
in
the
h.j.k.
theatre's
case,
upon
the
mere
allegation
of
a
possible
inconsistency
by
defense,
it's
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
to
read
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
there
is
some
--
there
has
been,
i
think,
a
slight
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
camera.
i
think
one
can't
be
too
dogmatic
about
the
second
circuit
practice
now
because
there
have
been
subsequent
opinions,
particularly,
the
spangelet
opinion
in
258
f.
2d
in
which
judge
hincks
refers
to
the
burden
of
the
trial
judge
and
refers
to
the
necessity
of
the
defense
to
particularize
what
portions
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
that
they
want
the
judge
to
read.
judge
sobeloff
in
this
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
herzog
case
was
concerned
about
making
the
--
putting
an
--
the
burden
of
--
on
the
trial
judge
who
has
got
a
lot
of
other
things
to
do,
of
scanning
the
grand
jury
minutes,
particularly,
when
they,
as
an
antitrust
case,
they
may
cover
volumes.
and,
judge
sobeloff,
here,
while
he
didn't
dissent
from
the
proposition
that
the
trial
judge
should
inspect
the
grand
jury
minutes,
whenever
there
was
--
there
were
any
circumstances
at
all
that
he
felt
justified
that
was
very
careful
not
to
impose
any
mandatory
duty
on
the
trial
judges,
not
to
make
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
the
h.j.k.
theatre's
opinion
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
you'll
find
a
sentence
in
judge
frank's
opinion
that
says,
"that
where
the
--
where
inconsistency
is
alleged
or
shown."
mr.
philip
elman
and,
reading
it
literally,
it
sounds
as
if
the
mere
allegation
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
am
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
i
must
confess
that
my
knowledge
of
the
second
circuit
practice
is
based
solely
on
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
do
not
have
any
personal
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
district
court
practice.
the
--
there
is
an
opinion,
a
very
extensive
opinion,
by
judge
palmieri
in
the
consolidated
laundries
case
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
it's
159
f.
supp.
which
takes
a
view
which
i
think
is
in
accord
with
mr.
justice
harlan's
statement
of
the
practice.
it
suggests
that
there
is
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
judges
and
that
it
is
not
automatic,
but
i
--
as
i
say,
i
cannot
enlighten
the
court
beyond
that.
now,
on
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
mr.
jonas
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
jonas
was
the
last
government
witness
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
the
other
witnesses
had
referred
to
this
animosity
between
messer
and
jonas.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
inquired
as
to
whether
there
was
any
appearance
on
mr.
jonas'
cross-examination
that
he
was
an
unreliable
shifting
witness
and
so
on.
well,
the
record
thereto
is
quite
clear.
after
mr.
jonas
completed
his
direct
--
direct
testimony,
the
defense
asked
not
only
for
the
grand
jury
minutes,
but
they
also
asked
for
the
records
of
the
lenoir
corporation,
of
which
mr.
jonas
was
present,
and
they
also
asked
for
the
notes,
the
working
notes
of
the
government
counsel
--
government
trial
counsel,
and
that
request
was
granted
by
judge
paul
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
that
these
papers
would
give
them
a
basis
for
impeachment
of
jonas'
testimony.
and
those
records
were
all
turned
over,
those
notes
were
given
over
to
the
defense,
and
after
they
had
examined
them,
they
came
back
and
in
effect
said,
"judge
paul,
we
do
not
wish
to
cross-examine
jonas."
the
subs
--
the
cross-examination
of
jonas
was
almost
negligible.
he
was
not
cross-examined
by
defense
counsel
on
any
of
the
really
important
points
which
they
say
here
were
decisive
in
the
case.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
philip
elman
may
i
--
may
i
refer
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
karp,
who
was
government's
trial
counsel,
had
interviewed
jonas
prior
to
the
trial,
and
he
had
made
some
notes
on
the
basis
of
such
interviews
and
those
notes
were
turned
over
to
the
court.
the
--
judge
paul
looked
at
them.
he
said,
"i
don't"
--
he
said
to
the
defense,
"i
don't
think
you're
entitled
and
i
don't
think
they
come
under
the
jencks
statute.
they
look
to
me
like
summaries
and
i
--
they
--
and
they
bear
out
everything
that
jonas
testified,
but
i
have
no
objection
to
your
looking
at
them,"
and
they
were
turned
over.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
may
i?
mr.
philip
elman
251,
thank
you
very
much.
now,
on
this
--
if
i
may
--
if
i
might
give
you
a
record
reference
for
what
i
said
just
a
moment
ago
about
their
not
cross-examining
jonas
after
this
effort
to
discredit
him.
this
--
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
296
and
297.
can
--
this
is
a
colloquy
between
court
and
counsel,
and
judge
paul
refers,
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
296,
"you
gentlemen,
yesterday,
mr.
gilmore
made
a
great
furor
and
he
want
to
examine
all
these
records
of
mr.
jonas
to
discredit
him
to
affect
his
credibility.
he
wanted
the
statements
given
to
counsel
for
the
government
and
they
were
furnished
to
you.
you
went
in
there
and
spent
an
hour
at
this
morning
examining
mr.
jonas'
records,
and
then,
you
come
in
and
say,
"we
have
nothing
to
ask
him".
that
is
exactly
the
same
way
you
want
to
get
hold
of
these
grand
jury
minutes.
you
have
no
reason
to
think
that
there
is
any
contradiction
in
there.
you
just
want
to
get
hold
of
grand
jury
minutes
and
that's
not
permissible."
and
then,
as
the
saying
"a
repetition
of
what
appears
earlier."
in
other
words,
this
case
and
this
record,
we
respectfully
submit,
do
not
present
the
question
which
has
been
argued
here
this
morning
that
there
was
in
this
case
a
particularized
showing
as
to
a
particular
portion
of
a
particular
witness'
testimony
of
a
sort
that
made
it
an
abusive
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
to
refuse
to
inspect
the
minutes.
that
was
not
what
they
asked
for.
that
is
not
the
showing
they
made.
what
they
asked
for
here
was
an
automatic
delivery
of
the
entire
transcript
with
jonas'
testimony
and
the
court
of
appeals,
we
say,
was
absolutely
correct
in
holding
that
no
defendant
either
before
or
after
jencks
was
entitled
to
that.
now,
the
argument
was
made
this
morning
that
this
does
not
mean
any
wholesale
disclosure
of
the
grand
jury
testimony.
well,
the
--
the
only
basis
for
the
inspection
of
disclosure
here
was
he
testified
before
the
--
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
and
we
see
no
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
observation
yesterday
that
you
can
make
the
same
showing
as
to
every
witness
at
the
trial
who
has
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and,
presumably
when
the
grand
jury
indicts,
it
does
so
on
the
basis
of
incriminating
testimony
and
the
witnesses,
or
at
least
many
of
them
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
are
bound
to
be
called
to
testify
at
the
trial.
and,
if
every
witness
who
has
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
who
testifies
at
the
trial
has
his
grand
jury
testimony
turned
over
to
the
defense,
we
think
you
have
the
same
kind
of
wholesale
disclosure,
the
same
kind
of
wholesale
breach
of
secrecy
that
this
court
last
term,
in
the
procter
and
gamble
case,
rejected.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
we
think
--
we
think,
in
the
first
place,
it's
always
--
it's
always
open
to
the
defense
to
cross-examine
the
witness
as
to
whether
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
what
his
testimony
was.
it's
--
the
defense
in
cross-examination
can
attempt
to
breakdown
his
story
in
every
way
it
can.
it
--
the
defense
can
present
other
witnesses
who
contradict
the
particular
witness'
testimony.
we
think
that
once
that
is
done
at
the
trial,
they
will
have
a
foundation
of
some
sort
upon
which
to
invoke
the
judicial
discretion
of
the
judge.
we
don't
think
it
can
--
you
can
lay
down
an
absolute
rule
that
the
defendant
always
gets
it
simply
on
the
showing
that
the
witness
has
testified.
we
don't
think
you
can
lay
down
an
absolute
rule
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
lay
down
an
absolute
rule
that
the
defendant
never
gets
it.
and,
every
judge
that
has
considered
this
problem,
except
for
the
judges
in
the
third
circuit
who
we
think
acted
in
almost
a
mechanical
response
to
the
jencks
decision,
every
judge
who
said,
in
the
last
analysis,
"you've
got
to
--
you've
make
--
you
have
to
balance
these
rights
of
the
defendant
and
of
the
grand
jury
and
exercise
a
discretion,"
and
it's
a
reviewable
discretion.
it's
a
--
and
it's
a
discretion
which
we
think
is
no
different
from
the
discretion
which
in
other
respects,
a
trial
judge
has
to
exercise
to
protect
the
right
of
the
defendant,
the
constitutional
right
of
the
defendant
to
a
fair
trial.
now,
there's
been
some
reference
to
this
being
the
government's
choice.
the
government
choose
--
chose
to
call
this
witness
and
the
government
by
doing
that
is
waived
secrecy.
well,
one
thing
is
clear.
it
is
that
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
isn't
the
government
privilege.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
executive
privilege.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
papers
that
belong
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
we're
dealing
here
with
what
is
really
a
judicial
privilege.
the
grand
jury
is
an
arm
of
the
court
and
the
reasons
for
secrecy
aren't
to
--
help
the
government
or
to
help
or
to
protect
the
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury.
the
reasons
for
secrecy
are,
as
this
court
has
said
several
times,
that
it
is
indispensable
to
the
grand
jury
as
an
institution
which
is
--
which
is
recognized
in
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
fifth
amendment
as
the
method,
the
sole
method,
for
initiating
serious
criminal
charges.
you've
got
to
preserve
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury.
you've
got
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury.
you've
got
to
protect
the
grand
jury
sometimes
from
the
state,
the
prosecution,
and
all
that,
all
these
reasons
are
for
the
grand
jury's
protection
and
for
the
protection
of
the
community
and
not
for
the
government.
now,
rule
6
(e)
recognizes
that
very
specifically.
i
could
give
you
a
simple
example
of
that.
i
have
not
read
the
grand
jury
transcript
in
this
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
rule
6
(e)
says
it
may
be
read
by
government
attorneys
only
for
use
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
i
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
--
in
the
performance
of
my
duties
as
counsel
for
the
government
in
this
case
in
this
court
to
read
the
grand
--
to
read
the
grand
jury
minutes.
but,
suppose
i
had
done
so
and
suppose
i
had
considered
that
it
wasn't
fair
to
my
associates
on
the
other
side
that
i
should
have
had
the
benefit
of
that
reading
and
that
they
had
not.
suppose
i
thought
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
justice
that
they
read
those
grand
jury
minutes
and
suppose
i
had
secured
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
to
have
them
see
those
grand
jury
minutes.
could
i
have
done
so?
the
answer
is
i
clearly
could
not
because
rule
6
(e)
says
in
the
second
sentence
that
a
--
an
attorney
may
disclose
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
only
when
so
directed
by
the
court
preliminarily
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding.
i
would
have
had
to
secure
an
order
of
this
court
and
the
permission
of
this
court
to
have
counsel
on
the
other
side
see
these
grand
jury
minutes.
it
couldn't
have
a
clear
illustration
of
the
fact
that
this
isn't
--
these
grand
jury
minutes
don't
belong
to
the
department
of
justice.
the
rule
permits
the
government
to
make
a
record
of
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
permits
attorneys
to
use
them
in
connection
with
their
duties.
well,
there's
a
very
good
reason
why
rule
6
(e)
does
that.
it's
helpful
not
only
to
the
government,
but
it's
helpful
to
the
grand
jury
that
there'd
be
a
record
of
the
proceedings,
particularly,
in
an
antitrust
case
such
as
this
one
where
you
have
an
industry-wide
investigation
and
the
grand
jury
sits
over
a
period
of
months
hearing
scores
of
witnesses.
it
would
be
wasteful.
it
would
be
uneconomical.
it
would
be
a
very
foolish
way
of
doing
business
not
to
have
some
record
of
the
testimony.
it
would
be
very
important
not
only
to
determine
whom
to
indict,
but
whom
not
to
indict,
to
know
what
the
testimony
was.
leads
given
by
the
testimony
have
to
be
explored.
the
use
of
the
making
of
a
record
and
the
use
of
that
record
is
--
has
been
deemed
by
the
court
and
the
rule.
and,
the
rule
as
i
--
the
court
knows,
was
submitted
by
congress
as
the
force
of
statute.
it
was
deemed
appropriate
and
right
that
the
government
should
be
able
to
use
that
procedure.
now,
are
we
to
say
that,
because
that
procedure
is
followed
and
the
government
does
make
a
record
that
somehow
the
government's
action
prejudices
the
right
of
the
grand
jury
as
secrecy?
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
you
can,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
elman
you
can.
this
--
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
there's
no
--
mr.
philip
elman
you
can
ask
the
witness
because
the
rule
imposes
no
obligation
of
secrecy
on
the
witness.
you
can
ask
him
what
he
testified
to.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right
and
he
may
say,
"i
did
testify
before
the
grand
jury
and
what
i
testified
to
there
is
different
from
what
i'm
testifying
today,"
and
the
reason
--
mr.
philip
elman
suppose
he
said
it
was
the
same.
well,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
you
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
there,
again,
you
have
to
leave
it
to
the
trial
judge
who
is
on
the
spot.
he
can
see
the
witness.
he
may
think
that
this
witness
is
lying,
or
he
may
be
troubled
by
it,
or
the
inconsistencies
that
are
alleged
may
relate
to
a
specific
narrow
part
of
the
grand
jury
minutes.
so,
that
isn't
--
it's
a
very
simple
matter
for
the
judge
to
say,
"you
prosecute
now.
you
let
me
take
a
look
at
those
minutes.
i
just
--
i
want
to
see
what
he
said
before
the
grand
jury."
now,
i
--
we
recognize
that
protection
of
the
rights
of
the
defendant
in
this
particular
regard
must
be
left
to
the
good
sense,
the
wisdom
of
the
trial
judge,
but
if
--
but
that
is
the
only
way,
you
can
--
we
think,
that
you
can
balance
these
two
rights,
both
of
them
of
importance
to
the
accused.
it's
just
as
important
to
the
accused,
to
the
citizens,
that
there'd
be
an
independent
grand
jury
which
can
have
testimony
before
it
which
is
uninhibited
and
unrestrained
by
publicity.
and,
as
the
court
said
last
term
in
procter
and
gamble,
the
grand
jury,
as
a
public
institution
serving
the
community,
might
suffer
if
those
testifying
today
knew
that
the
secrecy
of
their
testimony
would
be
lifted
tomorrow.
so
that,
it's
no
answer
to
say
that
once
the
witness
has
testified,
once
the
grand
jury
has
concluded
its
deliberations,
then
all
the
reasons
for
secrecy
disappear.
that
were
an
answer
--
that
would
have
been
an
answer
long
before
the
jencks
case
and
there's
nothing
new
about
the
jencks
case
that
deals
with
this
proposition.
what
--
what
your
honors
are
being
asked
now
is
to
make
a
drastic
far-reaching
departure
from
established
law
and
we
think
that
if
the
court
is
to
consider
that,
it
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
experience,
and
it
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
views
of
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
grand
jury
as
a
functioning
institution.
mr.
philip
elman
with
--
as
the
court
said,
in
the
isthmian
case,
it
should
be
able
to
act
on
the
basis
of
information
and
not
speculation.
and,
if
the
matter
were
dealt
with
in
--
through
the
rule
making
process,
the
court
could
then
call
upon
experienced
trial
judges
--
experienced
federal
trial
judges
who
are
--
who
have
first-hand
experience
with
the
trial
jury
and
who
can
tell
your
honors
whether
it
would
not
--
would
or
would
not
impair
the
efficiency
of
the
grand
jury
to
lift
the
secrecy
of
its
proceedings
in
this
regard.
you
could
--
you
could
call
upon
those
who
were
experienced
with
the
state
court
and
who
could
tell
your
honors
whether
or
not
the
decline
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
states
is
or
is
not
attributable
to
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
breach
of
secrecy
to
a
large
extent
in
state
procedure.
thank
you
very
much.
