mr.
leland
hazard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
antitrust
case
in
which
the
petitioner,
pittsburgh
plate
glass
company,
and
six
other
defendants
and
two
individuals
were
convicted
of
a
price-fixing
conspiracy.
the
conviction
was
sustained
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
limited
to
the
--
granted
and
limited
to
the
question
whether
a
grand
jury
testimony
may
be
a
prior
statement
within
the
meaning
of
jencks
versus
united
states.
i'll
state
just
enough
of
the
facts
to
eliminate
that
issue.
a
trade
association
known
as
the
mirror
manufacturers
association
of
which
pittsburgh
plate
glass
company,
if
i
may,
i'll
refer
to
that
company
as
ppg
hereafter,
ppg
was
not
a
member
of
the
trade
association.
it
held
its
1954
annual
meeting
at
asheville,
north
carolina.
a
representative
of
ppg,
w.
a.
gordon,
a
manager
of
plate
glass
sales,
the
only
defendant
--
individual
defendant
who
was
acquitted
in
the
case,
was
present
at
this
association
meeting
for
the
purpose
of
cultivating
customers
for
polished
plate
glass.
mirrors
are
made,
as
i
am
sure
the
court
knows,
by
the
silvering
of
one
side
of
a
certain
quality
of
plate
glass.
now,
another
name,
jonas,
a
name
which
will
loom
--
does
loom
large
in
the
issue
before
us.
the
government's
principal
witness,
jonas
was
the
president
of
one
of
the
larger
mirror
manufactures,
not
indicted
in
the
case.
jonas
was
not
present
at
asheville.
there
was
concern
there
among
the
mirror
manufactures
present
in
asheville
about
a
shortage
of
plate
glass,
a
shortage
which
was
occurring
particularly
at
the
time
when
the
market,
which
had
been
quite
bad
for
mirrors,
was
looking
up.
and,
there
was
discussion
at
asheville
among
some
of
the
mirror
manufactures
about
an
increase
in
price.
some
of
them
made
a
telephone
call
and
a
joint
call
to
jonas
who
was
not
there
and
reported
to
him
the
discussion
about
the
price
of
--
of
plate
glass
mirrors.
jonas
expressed
disbelief.
there
had
been
a
price
war.
it
was
not
the
best
feeling,
apparently,
in
some
quarters.
and,
jonas
said
he'd
liked
to
talk
to
gordon.
and
gordon
was
requested
to
--
to
call
jonas
by
some
of
those
who
had
first
called
jonas,
and
gordon
did.
the
only
testimony
we
have
on
what
was
said
in
that
telephone
conversation
between
gordon
and
jonas
is
the
testimony
of
jonas.
he
said,
first,
that
he
--
jonas
was
not
much
in
favor
of
raising
my
prices
at
that
time,
but
he
asked
gordon
if
there
was
anything
to
this
discussion
and
gordon
said
he
had
heard,
in
some
of
the
rooms,
some
conversation
about
price.
we
must
look
again
to
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
jonas
as
to
this
portion
of
the
record.
jonas
said
in
his
testimony
that
gordon
might
have
said,
just
like
anybody
would
say,
“you
ought
to
be
getting
more
for
the
product
than
we
were
getting
for
it.”
now,
jonas
testified
that
the
alleged
conspiracy
could
not
have
been
effectuated
without
jonas'
participation.
and,
he,
himself,
confessed
--
conspirator
claimed
for
himself
indispensability.
the
asheville
meeting
ended
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
and,
on
the
next
day
following,
there
was
a
meeting
at
a
place
called
the
“bluffs,”
an
inn
on
blue
ridge
parkway.
and,
those
present
at
this
meeting
were
messer,
one
of
the
defendants,
buchan,
representing
one
of
the
corporate
defendants,
stroupe,
representing
one
of
the
corporate
defendants,
and
jonas
who
had
not
been
present
at
asheville
but
did
go
to
the
meeting
at
the
bluffs.
no
one
representing
ppg
was
present
at
the
meeting
at
the
bluffs.
jonas
was
the
only
witness
who
testified
that
an
agreement
was
reached
at
the
bluffs.
other
witnesses
testified
that
the
meeting
was
held
but
it
was
jonas,
and
only
jonas,
who
testified
that
an
agreement
was
reached
there
to
increase
the
price
to
78%
off
list.
this
meeting
at
the
bluffs
occurred
on
a
thursday.
and,
on
friday,
six
companies
announced
a
price
change
to
78
off
list.
on
the
next
day,
one
company
followed,
and
then,
on
the
following
monday,
ppg
announced
from
its
high
point
warehouse,
which
had
not
been
represented
at
asheville,
a
price
change
to
that
same
figure.
jonas
testified
that
he
called
gordon
in
pittsburgh
on
friday,
the
day
following
the
meeting
at
the
bluffs,
and,
not
reaching
gordon,
that
he
gave
to
prichard,
an
associate
of
gordon's,
the
message
of
the
bluffs
meeting.
jonas
testified
that,
again,
on
the
following
monday,
he
called
prichard
and
asked
prichard
if
had
given
gordon
the
message
that
jonas
had
given
to
prichard
of
the
meeting
about
the
bluffs,
and
jonas
testified
that
prichard
said
that
he
had.
this
was
categorically
denied
by
prichard.
he
took
the
stand
and
testified
that,
although
jonas
frequently
called
ppg,
ppg
was
jonas'
supplier
of
plate
glass,
about
shipments
of
glass,
that
jonas
had
never
reported
to
prichard
or
spoken
to
prichard
about
the
meeting
at
the
bluffs
or
about
the
alleged
conspiracy.
i
--
these
are
the
facts.
i
come
now
to
the
question
whether
a
record
of
grand
jury
testimony,
having
been
kept,
the
transcript
of
that
testimony
constitutes
a
prior
statement
of
the
trial
witness,
subject
to
the
standards
of
jencks.
the
government
makes
a
candid
concession
which,
i
think,
justifies
the
notice
of
the
court.
it
appears
at
page
30
of
the
brief
and,
while
the
court
is
turning
to
that,
i
need
mention
only
that
jencks
holds
that
there's
no
need
for
a
prior
showing
of
conflict,
that
it's
sufficient
if
the
prior
statement
relates
to
the
testimony
of
the
witness,
that
only
the
defendant
may
inspect,
that
is,
that
inspection
by
the
defendant
through
his
counsel
was
the
only
adequate
inspection,
that
inspection
in
camera
is
disapproved,
and
that
executive
privilege
in
that
case,
in
the
jencks
case,
was
no
bar
to
the
inspection.
now,
the
government
says,
on
page
30,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
opposite
of
numeral
1,
“there
is
no
need
to
deny
that
many
of
the
considerations
which
led
this
court
in
jencks
to
order
production
of
the
informer's
statements
also
tend
to
support
petitioner's
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
equally
free
access
to
a
witness
prior
grand
jury
testimony,
but
there
is
here
present
an
important
countervailing
consideration
which
was
absent
in
jencks,
the
long-established
policy
that
maintains
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
in
the
federal
courts,
citing
united
states
against
procter
and
gamble.”
well,
i
need
only
mention
that,
in
procter
and
gamble,
no
witness
had
taken
the
stand.
i
--
i
do
need
to
mention
that
it
was
in
that
decision
in
which
this
court,
not
reaching
the
point
that
we
have
before
us,
noted
that
use
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
at
the
trial
to
impeach
a
witness,
to
refresh
his
recollection,
to
test
his
credibility,
and
the
like,
that
these
would
be
cases
of
particularized
need
where
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
is
lifted
discretely
and
limitedly.
the
government
relies
on
hailing,
may
i
say,
after
the
concession,
almost
exclusively,
on
one
of
the
foundations
for
the
policy
of
grand
jury
secrecy
mentioned
in
procter
and
gamble
and
else
where,
that
is,
the
policy
to
encourage
by
the
rule
of
secrecy
free
disclosures
by
persons
who
have
information
with
respect
to
the
commission
of
--
commission
of
crimes.
the
government
argues
that
the
grand
jury
witnesses
might
not
testify
fully
if
they
did
not
have
the
assurance
of
secrecy.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
no
grand
jury
witness
ever
had
such
an
assurance
or
could
have.
the
witness
knows
that
the
government
may
call
him
at
the
trial
and,
using
the
grand
jury
transcript,
make
him
testify
to
that
which
he
testified
to
at
the
grand
jury.
the
witness
knows
that
his
trial
testimony
will
not
be
limited
to
what
he
may
wish
to
testify
to
there,
regardless
of
what
he
said
before
the
grand
jury.
and,
if
the
government
could
give
such
an
assurance,
perjury
would
be
encouraged.
if
the
trial
testimony
is
consistent
with
the
grand
jury
testimony,
then
disclosure
occurs.
the
secrecy
has
been
destroyed
by
the
act
of
the
government
in
calling
the
witness
and,
if
the
trial
testimony
is
not
consistent
with
the
grand
jury
testimony,
then
that
is
precisely
the
particularize
need
which
entitles
the
defense
to
the
examination
of
that
record
by
counsel.
if
the
government
wishes
to
assure
witnesses
that
there
grand
jury
testimony
will
never
be
disclosed,
the
government
has
a
method
for
that.
it
is
the
government
which
decides
whether
or
not
to
keep
the
record.
no
law
requires
the
taking
of
a
transcript
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
but,
the
government,
having
once
elected
to
take
that
record,
must
then
make
it
available
in
a
particularized
need
case
for
use
on
cross-examination.
if
the
government
wishes
to
protect
that
witness
under
the
rule
of
secrecy,
then
it
need
only
refrain
from
taking
the
record.
mr.
leland
hazard
if
the
--
mr.
leland
hazard
if
the
witness
testifies
at
the
trial,
that
his
testimony
there
covered
the
same
subject
matter
--
mr.
leland
hazard
as
--
at
the
grand
jury,
then
my
--
mr.
leland
hazard
i
read
jencks
--
mr.
leland
hazard
i
think
that
the
statute
does
not
purport
to
bear
on
the
case
we
have
here,
but
i
read
jencks
to
mean
that
when
the
government
has
called
a
witness
and
record
shows
he
testified
that
he
had
testified
on
the
same
subject
matter
at
the
trial.
mr.
leland
hazard
no.
mr.
leland
hazard
no,
sir,
no.
mr.
leland
hazard
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
leland
hazard
no,
sir,
i
think
not.
mr.
leland
hazard
because
jencks
establishes
standards
which
have
ends
of
justice
standards
mentioned
in
both
--
mr.
leland
hazard
i
think
--
mr.
leland
hazard
i
think
that
is
what
is
before
this
court.
mr.
leland
hazard
i
have
--
i
have
examined
the
reasons
for
grand
jury
secrecy
enunciated
by
this
court
in
several
cases,
as
late
as
procter
and
gamble,
and
i
submit,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
those
foundations
well
stated
out
there
do
not
include
this
case.
mr.
leland
hazard
well,
that
was
the
case
which
was
--
mr.
leland
hazard
--
confined
--
mr.
leland
hazard
entirely
to
refreshments.
mr.
leland
hazard
and
--
mr.
leland
hazard
and
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
it
had
to
--
the
refreshment
had
to
do
with
menutia.
mr.
leland
hazard
i
think
that's
right.
if
the
court
please,
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
leland
hazard
yes,
you
could.
mr.
leland
hazard
that's
right.
mr.
leland
hazard
that's
right.
i
think
we
would
have
been
here,
regardless
of
jencks,
on
the
same
fundamental
of
what
is
a
fair
trial.
mr.
leland
hazard
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
disclaim
for
the
petitioner
any
intent
to
wipe
the
slate
clean.
the
foundations
of
the
phrase
says
the
grand
jury
secrecy
are
multiple
and
there
is
no
intent
here
to
shatter
those
foundations,
for
example,
to
prevent
the
escape
of
those
who
are
about
to
be
indicted
with
no
attack
on
that
foundation.
i'm
--
i'm
extracting
these
from
procter
and
gamble,
recently
enunciated
by
this
court,
and
the
only
witness
for
it.
to
ensure
the
utmost
freedom
to
the
grand
jury
in
its
deliberation,
that
is,
you
can't
have
cameras,
and
the
newspapers,
reporters
in
television
in
the
grand
jury
room
or
anything
else.
there
is
no
attack
on
that
foundation.
mr.
leland
hazard
that
is
my
point.
mr.
leland
hazard
it's
--
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
leland
hazard
to
prevent
subornation
of
perjury
or
tampering
with
the
witness
who
may
testify
before
the
grand
jury
and,
later,
appear
at
the
trial.
there's
no
attack
on
that
foundation.
to
encourage
free
disclosures,
i
have
discussed
that.
it's
only
by
osmosis
that
this
case
might
be
drawn
into
that,
number
4.
and,
the
fifth
reason,
and
the
last
one,
enunciated
by
this
court
in
procter
and
gamble,
to
protect
an
innocent
accused
who
is
exonerated
from
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
he
was
under.
in
fact,
there's
no
attack
on
that
--
on
that
foundation.
procter
and
gamble
was
a
case,
a
civil
case
first,
it
was
the
case
in
which
the
defense,
knowing
that
a
grand
jury
transcript
was
going
to
be
used
in
preparing
a
bill
in
a
civil
case,
sought
to
get
the
same
material.
and,
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
blanket
approach
and
didn't
allow
it.
but,
this
is
a
particularized
approach
in
this
case.
this
is
pinpoint.
here
is
a
self-confessed
conspirator,
not
indicted
himself,
his
company
not
indicted,
who
testified
that
he
was
indispensable
to
the
conspiracy.
that
it
couldn't
have
been
effectuated
without
him.
and,
he
put
the
words
in
gordon's
mouth
and
he
put
the
words
in
prichard's
mouth.
now,
it
said
here
that
he
was
not
the
only
principal
witness,
but
i
heard
no
other
name
fall
from
the
lips
of
my
brother,
nor
--
mr.
leland
hazard
--
did
i
hear
--
mr.
leland
hazard
this
--
mr.
leland
hazard
we
do
not
--
mr.
leland
hazard
we
do
not
ask
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
only
if
the
witness
takes
the
stand
and
only
--
mr.
leland
hazard
if
he
testifies
on
the
stand
that
he
testified
on
the
same
subject
matter
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
leland
hazard
not
“did
you
testify?”
“did
you
testify
on
the
same
--
mr.
leland
hazard
--
subject
matter?”
mr.
leland
hazard
and
here,
he
testified
that
he
did
on
that
same
subject
matter,
the
price
conspiracy.
mr.
leland
hazard
and
it
is
for
that
reason.
now,
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
although
there
is
evidence
--
laudable
evidence
of
candor
here,
what
the
government
is
really
after
is
an
advantage
which,
in
a
fair
trial,
it
cannot
have.
the
government
wants
the
privilege
of
using
that
grand
jury
transcript
to
keep
this
witness
on
the
stand
in
a
--
in
a
channel
which
the
government
takes.
and
having
used
that
transcript
for
that
purpose,
it
then
asks
that
this
court
approve
its
refusal
to
withhold
it
from
the
defense.
mr.
leland
hazard
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
leland
hazard
i
say
that
either
he
does
not
have
the
discretion
under
rule
6
or
he
abuses
it.
i
don't
care
which
it
is.
rule
6
gives
a
permission.
it
does
not
contain
a
prohibition.
and,
i
say
that
the
permission
given
in
that
rule
was
not
validly
exercised
here
by
withholding
the
--
the
transcript.
mr.
leland
hazard
i
--
i
--
well,
otherwise,
the
jury
or
attorney,
interpreter
or
stenographer
may
disclose
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
only
when
so
directed
by
the
--
by
the
court.
this,
i
say,
gives
the
court
a
discretion.
there
is
one
point,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
i
--
i
want
to
make
clear
in
this
connection.
that
is,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
production
and
use.
our
position
is
that
once
the
witness
has
been
put
on
the
stand,
once
he
has
testified
to
the
same
subject
matter
as
he
testified
to
before
the
grand
jury,
then
counsel
for
the
defense
must
have
access
to
the
transcript.
otherwise,
the
defendant
is
denied
the
right
of
counsel,
unless
his
counsel
can
examine.
now,
having
examined
that
it's
entirely
conceivable
that
the
government
may
bring
many
matters
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge,
the
judge
--
trial
judge
himself
may,
on
his
own
motion,
consider
many
matters
which
will
be
withheld
but
only
after
counsel
for
the
accused
has
had
the
acces
and
has
made
the
examination
or
the
right
to
make
the
examination.
i
would
invite
the
attention
of
the
court,
in
closing,
to
what
i
believe
the
government
is
after
here.
it
simply
wishes
to
keep
the
grand
jury
testimony
as
its
exclusive
tactical
weapon,
for
its
own
use,
to
trial.
now,
in
a
democracy,
we
allow
the
grand
jury,
a
great
body
of
inquisitorial
powers,
and
this
is
necessary
in
the
interest
of
discovering
the
evidences
of
crime.
but,
to
extend
the
inquisition
into
the
courtroom
by
the
devise
of
withholding
that
transcript
from
the
defense
which
has
been
used
for
the
prosecution,
that
goes
too
far.
that's
our
case.
