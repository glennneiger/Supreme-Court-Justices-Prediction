mr.
malcolm
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
in
dismissing
an
information.
since
it
seems
to
involve
the
construction
of
section
214
of
title
18,
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted.
brief
of
this
or
the
record
is
of
course
extremely
brief.
the
information
is
one
paragraph
long.
it
read
as
follows
on
or
about
of
the
5th
of
december
1953,
in
the
city
of
york,
pennsylvania,
in
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
and
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
in
violation
of
section
213,
the
defendant
did
knowingly,
willfully
and
unlawfully
offered
or
promised
to
congressman
stauffer
to
donate
to
the
republican
party
the
sum
of
$1000
a
year
in
consideration
of
the
use
of
influence
to
procure
the
office
of
postmaster
of
york,
pennsylvania.
the
defendant,
through
his
counsel,
this
information
was
filed
on
july
of
1954
and
the
defendant,
through
his
counsel,
immediately
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
this
information
did
not
state
a
cause
or
crime
within
section
214.
the
matter
was
briefed
and
argued
in
september
of
1954
and
then
march
17,
1958.
the
decision
was
handed
down
and
the
order
dismissing
the
information.
the
court
below
looked
at
the
information,
looked
back
at
the
statute
and
said
that
the
offer
of
$1000,
to
donate
$1000
to
the
republican
party
made
the
republican
party
the
offeree,
and
that
the
language
of
section
214
read,
“whoever…offers
or
promises
money
or
a
thing
of
value,
to
any
person,
firm
or
corporation
in
consideration
use
of
influence
is
guilty
of
misdemeanor,”
pointed
out
that
the
republican
party
is
not
a
firm,
person
or
corporation
and
therefore,
not
within
--
not
proscribed
by
the
act.
the
judge
went
on
to
point
out
that
section
215,
which
he
called
the
counterpart,
was
originally
enacted
in
1926
with
section
214,
as
two
sections
of
one
act.
and
that
this
other
section
specifically
provides
for
political
contribution
says,
“whoever
here
in
the
form
of
political
contribution
or
for
personal
emolument
solicits
money
or
a
thing
of
value
shall
be
guilty
of
misdemeanor.”
he
points
that
this
indicates
that
it
was
not
intended
to
proscribe
the
use
of
an
offer
of
a
political
contribution
in
section
214.
we
think
that
first,
the
lower
court
misconceived
the
issue
but
in
any
event,
that
the
republican
party
is
a
person
within
the
broad
meaning
of
that
term
in
criminal
law.
to
go
to
the
second
point
first,
and
i
would
rather
but
the
case
did
not
go
off
on
that
because
it
doesn't
sit
very
well.
it
is
not
an
easy
feeling
but
nevertheless,
it
is
a
supportable
one
that
the
republican
party
is
a
person
within
section
1
of
title
1,
which
was
enacted
one
year
prior
to
the
reenactment
of
section
214,
includes,
except
where
the
context
indicates
otherwise
a
--
an
association
of
persons.
this
matter
was
recently
before
this
court
in
the
matter
of
a
partnership
as
was
there
it
could
be
an
entity
that
could
be
prosecuted
under
criminal
statute,
which
began
with
the
words
“whoever”
and
it
was
determined
in
the
a
&
p
trucking
company
case
decided
last
month,
that
such
a
broad
interpretation,
the
word
“whoever”
came
within
the
criminal
proscription
of
that
particular
act.
and
we
believe
that
a
republican
party
is
a
person
within
the
broad
meaning
of
the
word
“person”
in
section
1
of
title
1
of
the
united
states
code,
but
this
is
a
stiff
and
stilted
interpretation.
the
indictment
or
the
information
says
that
the
offer
or
promise
was
to
congressman
stauffer,
and
we
think
that
the
real
issue
is
whether
he
was
offered
anything
of
value.
and
the
defendant,
the
defense
counsel
on
page
14
of
this
brief
says,
“this
is
the
basic
policy
of
our
brief,
at
least
we
agree
this
is
the
main
point
on
which
the
issue
should
be
determined
that
here
is
an
offer
to
a
party,
to
support
this
party
if
he
gets
a
public
office
or
inconsideration
of
the
congressman
using
his
efforts
to
get
this
man
a
political
appointed
office.”
the
first
point,
first
hurl
i
think,
we
have
to
get
over
is
the
fact
that
this
is
money,
a
$1000,
it
is
money
and
we're
coming
in
under
the
phrase,
“thing
of
value”.
the
defendant
in
his
brief
points
out
that
the
money
or
thing
of
value
is
in
the
disjuncture
and
that
one
cannot
be
the
other.
although
later
in
--
on
page
14
on
the
top
page
15,
in
order
to
limit
the
broad
scope
of
the
word
or
phrase,
“thing
of
value,”
he
says
that
the
words
“money”
modify
color
and
give
meaning
to
the
phrase,
“thing
of
value.”
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
i
believe
that
money
to
another
person
can
be
a
thing
of
value
to
the
first
person.
i
think
perhaps
if
we
change
the
illustration
just
enough
that
this
offer
was
a
$1000
a
year
to
his
law
partner,
we
can
see
that
it
would
not
be
the
equivalent
of
a
$1000
a
year
at
the
end
but
it
would
be
something
very
definitely
a
thing
of
value.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
in
--
in
form,
it
was
money,
but
the
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
that's
right.
that
is
all
it's
charging.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
that's
right.
but
money,
i
believe,
to
a
third
person,
can
be
a
thing
of
value
to
the
actual
recipient
of
the
promise.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
well,
of
course,
he
didn't
promise
that.
our
difficulty
is
he
immediately
did
not
promise
a
$1000
to
congressman
stauffer.
it
would
be
a
far
more
direct
case
if
he
had,
he
did
not?
mr.
malcolm
anderson
this
--
we
believe,
the
benefit,
would
come
to
congressman
stauffer
but
not
maybe
perhaps
a
full
$1000
worth.
it
is
a
thing
of
value
claim,
the
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
the
information
is
silent
on
that
and
i
would
believe
that
it
would
be
paid
to
the
republican
party,
and
not
through
congressman
stauffer.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
that
is
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
well
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
we
assume
that
the
congressman
would
take
credit
for
having
acquired
it
if
he
accepted
the
offer.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
position.
that
the
promise
ran
through
the
congressman
that
it
was
not
money
to
him,
it
was
a
thing
of
value
to
him,
it
was
money
to
the
party.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
no.
the
word
“pay”
obviously
has
a
connotation
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
--
of
turning
over
money
rather
than
a
thing
of
value,
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
the
--
the
payment
would
be
by
the
defendant.
the
congressman
would
be
required
to
use
his
influence.
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
way
we
read
the
information,
we
feel
it
is
only
reasonable,
mr.
malcolm
anderson
no,
sir.
that
would
raise
a
--
a
far
more
difficult
question
which
i
would
like
to
avoid.
would
it
be
a
crime
if
it
was
offered
solely
to
the
party
to
use
its
influence?
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
this
is
the
way
we
would
like
the
issue
to
go
as
contrary
to
the
proposition
that
the
republican
party
is
a
person,
which
as
i
said
i
feel
is
a
rather
stiff
and
stilted
the
interpretation
of
the
language.
the
“thing
of
value”
phrase
is
much
used
in
the
bribery
chapter
of
title
18,
in
15
sections
of
the
23,
in
the
--
in
chapter
xi
of
the
penal
code,
the
words
“thing
of
value”
are
used
to
this
bribery
and
graft
chapters.
and
in
agents,
it
is
modified
or
there
are
other
words
used
in
conjunction
with
“thing
of
value”
and
in
several
instances
where
we
have
the
offer
of
a
bribe
being
prohibited,
we
have
one
set
of
words
used
and
where
we
have
the
solicitation
of
a
bribe,
we
another
set
of
words
used
in
connection
with
“thing
of
value”.
“thing
of
value”
has
had
just
about
as
broad
interpretation
in
the
law,
as
such
general
words
could
have,
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
which
is
pointed
out
by
the
defense
counsel
in
his
brief
that
almost
anything
then
could
be
challenged
in
the
--
in
this
area
as
a
thing
of
value
and
offer
to
do
a
good
job
as
postmaster
and
so
on.
this,
i
think,
is
something
that
is
inherent
though
in
the
criminal
law
procedure.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
well,
i
think
it
probably
it
does,
but
i
would
hesitate
to
be
bound
tightly
to
that.
in
--
in
the
words
and
phrases,
as
i
read
through,
yesterday,
i
found
that
the
“thing
of
value”
is
included
a
--
a
fur
cape,
a
cat,
a
dog.
the
--
and
such
the
ephemeral
things
as
the
endorsement
on
a
check
or
even
in
one
instance
the
use
of
a
machine
gun
and
a
car
to
make
a
getaway.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
have
no
objection
in
this
instance
to
its
being
joined
with
money.
i
think
perhaps
that
i
ought
not
to
be
restricted
too
much
because
i
find
that
the
conscience
and
judgment
of
the
prosecutors
in
the
control
of
the
courts
and
the
wisdom
of
the
juries
will
keep
us
from
attempting
to
extend
the
concept
of
the
“thing
of
value”
too
far
in
--
in
prosecuting
a
judgment
or
opinion.
and
i
think
this
is
something
that
is
true
also
of
immoral
conduct
as
in
the
manner.
yes,
sir?
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
think
that's
inherent
in
the
language.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
may
it
please
the
court.
the
one
issue
that
is
raised
is
the
desirability
of
encouraging
as
a
policy
in
our
republican
form
of
government,
the
contributions
to
political
parties.
this
is
of
course
a
major
problem
with
both
political
parties.
it
is
estimated
that
as
much
as
$40,000
is
needed
to
elect
a
congressman.
if
we
are
to
have
a
representative
form
of
government,
we
can't
limit
the
representatives
as
--
the
congressman
to
persons
who
are
able
to
afford
that,
so
that
we
do
agree
that
it
is
proper
to
encourage
contributions
to
political
parties.
both
major
parties
have
endeavored
to
broaden
the
base
so
that
the
contributions
will
come
more
from
the
actual
person's
representatives
numerically,
but
i'm
quite
sure
that
neither
major
party,
no
matter
how
great
this
problem
would
want
to
encourage
the
--
this
method
of
obtaining
money
for
political
parties.
in
other
words,
i
believe
the
policy
is
not
applicable
where
you're
--
apply
it
to
a
fact
situation
of
selling
or
buying
public
office.
and
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
congress
setting
forth
this
policy
of
the
country
that
this
is
one
way
in
which
money
is
not
to
be
raised
for
political
parties.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
then
we
come
and
that
is
true
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
term,
“thing
of
value”,
we
could
get
down
to
charitable
contributions
could
possibly
be
a
thing
of
value
to
the
offeree.
then,
i
say,
we
come
into
that
area
where
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
faith
placed
in
the
processes
of
the
law,
and
the
district
attorney
and
the
judges,
and
the
juries.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
best
illustration
of
its
working,
day
in
and
day
out
isn't
the
main
act
where
we
have
a
very
general
provision
that
any
person
who
takes
a
female
across
a
state
line
for
immoral
purposes
and
that
is
a
broad
term,
and
yet,
as
it
is
used
and
exercised,
it
is
limited
largely
to
commercialization,
the
overreaching
of
children,
female
children
of
tender
years.
but
it
is
capable
of
all
sorts
of
interpretations
of
what
is
an
immoral
purpose
and
for
that
reason,
i
say
that
this
falls,
not
because
it
would
not
be
a
thing
of
value,
but
because
in
the
processes
in
carrying
out
criminal
law,
there
has
to
be
some
faith
placed
in
the
offices
of
the
prosecuting
judge.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
of
course,
both
statutes
were
passed
at
the
same
time
and
the
only
language
we
find
is
that
they
were
considered
together
and
that
they
were
considered
as
both
aimed
at
the
bad
practice
of
buying
and
selling
offices.
and
we
believe
that
it
is
in
the
solicitation
section
as
an
additional
word
to
define
or
give
color
to
a
thing
of
value
because
they
anticipated
this
difficulty
arising
more
specifically
with
the
solicitor.
the
solicitor
is
saying,
“if
you
will
make
a
contribution
of
$10,000
to
the
party,
i'll
support
you
for
this
job.”
and
then
later,
the
solicitor
is
saying
that
this
was
not
the
sale
of
an
office
but
a
legitimate
political
activity
and
they
aimed
that
section
at
a
specific
hazard
which
they've
had
testimony
on.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
from
my
reading
of
the
congressional
issue,
i
would
say
that
elected
on
dead
center,
they
talked
generally
about
this
evil
of
buying
and
selling
offices.
there
is
no
explanation
that
i
could
find
as
to
why
it
was
put
in
one
section
and
not
in
the
other,
no
discussion
of
it.
as
we
point
out,
this
is
--
this
is
not
unique
in
these
two
sections.
in
our
brief,
we
pointed
out
at
least
two
other
instances
where
in
this
same
chapter,
between
bribery
and
graft,
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
language
used
defining
thing
of
value
or
not
defining
it
but
--
run
in
with
it
between
the
person
who
solicits
and
the
person
who
offers.
and
we
think
this
is
just
the
overall
attempt
of
congress
to
anticipate
some
sort
of
an
offer
of
a
thing
of
value
which
could
not
be
specific
--
specifically
spelled
out
and
be
safe
to
cover
the
whole
area
that
they
wish
to
cover.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
it
--
it--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
no,
sir.
there
is
no
explanation
of
it.
it
worried
me
and
i
must
confess,
i
didn't
resolve
my
worry.
it
seems
that
congress
was
getting
bound
to
place
where
they
were
just
throwing
in
all
other
type
of
solicitation
that
might
come
to
pass.
i
think
they
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
could
be
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
--
speculating
to
say.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
--i
think
that
the
whole
trend
of
reforming
criminal
law
has
been
towards
brevity.
i
noticed
in
reading
the
american
law
institute's
various
investigations
into
the
criminal
procedure.
they
suggest
an
information
should
be
a
murdered
thing
and
estoppel
that
statutes
then
would
be
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
murder.
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
sell
a
public
office
and
allow
the
interpretation
to
come
from
the
fact
situations
as
they're
brought
forward
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
perhaps
that
is
what
it
was
being
done
here.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
well,
it
certainly
seems,
when
you
step
back
from
the
language
of
this
and
look
at
what
was
actually
done.
here
is
a
man
coming
to
a
person.
the
postmaster
shifts
are
generally
considered
to
be
congressional
patriotism
of
coming
to
a
person
who
is
very
likely
to
be
the
person
who
makes
the
decision
as
to
who
will
be
the
postmaster
in
york
and
making
this
offer
to
him.
and
i
say
that
this
is
exactly
what
congress
meant
when
they
said,
you
shall
not
sell
a
public
office
or
offer
the
bottom.
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
think
that
i
don't
think
we
can
take
a
thing
or
part
from
value
because
i
think
that
the
endorsement
on
a
check
could
scarcely
be
called
a
thing
but
that
might
be
sufficient
to
be
a
bribe.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir,
but
the
‘thing
of
value”
is
word
they've
used
many
times.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
don't
think
it's
other
thing
of
value,
no,
sir.
in
fact,
there
is
a
considerable
doubt
whether
ejusdem
generis
should
apply
but
i
feel
it
here
there
is
problem
in
this
specific
fact
situation
because,
a
thing
of
value
and
money
are
very
closely
related
in
this
fact
situation.
but
i
think
that
a
thing
of
value
should
go
clear
on
out
to
include
absolutely
unrelated
things,
a
partnership
in
a
firm
or
something
of
that
sort
to
this
value.
or
we
feel
that
enclosing,
i'd
like
to
say
that
we
feel
this
is
the
specific
evil
that
congress
intended
to
meet.
this
is
an
offer
to
buy
a
public
office.
we
feel
that
we
urge
upon
this
court
to
so
hold.
thank
you.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
oh,
this
--
this
may
be,
but
my
personal
opinion
has
always
been
that
this
is
a
bad
trend
in
formal
procedure
that
we
should
not
go
off
into
detail
and
informations
or
indictments,
that
we
should
be
broad
in
scope
and
then
if
is
--
if
it
is
clear
that
the
man
is
not
able
to
defend,
then
we
should
answer
the
bill
of
particulars.
i
don't
think
than
an
information
should
be
thrown
out
or
an
indictment
thrown
out
because
of
particulars.
i
feel
that's
a
step
backwards
in
--
in
the
advance
in
history
of
criminal
law.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
think
the
court
could
say
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
would
say
that
that
i
would
determine
that
not
to
be
within
the
need
of
a
thing
of
value.
in
other
words,
i
would,
as
a
prosecutor
and
urge
upon
the
court
if
this
is
too
much,
if
this
is
going
too
far
with
the
meaning
and
a
thing
of
value.
but
i
wouldn't
be
concerned
that
thing
of
value
is
capable
of
such
broad.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
think
you
could
spell
it
out.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
could
spell
it
out.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
this
is
something
you
dearly
wanted
and
it
was
of
real
value.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
as
i
say,
this
runs
contrary
to
my
whole
feeling
in
the
field
of
criminal
law
that
we
should
spell
out
informations
and
indictments
in
such
detail.
i
think
the
defendant
is
absolutely
entitled
to
know
what
he
is
charged
with.
and
if
he
doesn't
understand
it,
it
should
be
given
the
fellow
particulars,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
indictment
should
fail
by
a
reason
of
not
spelling
things
out.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
yes,
sir.
that's
my
point.
that's
my
feeling.
i
don't
--
i
don't
like
to
see
cases
go
off
on
technicalities
in
the
indictment
or
information.
that's
just
too
personal.
thank
you.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
would
only
say
one
word,
your
honor,
that
is
this
problem
of
nexus.
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
getting
away
from
the
issue
and
that
is
what
was
in
the
mind
of
mr.
shirey?
would
this
what
he
offers
to
the
congressman,
persuade
the
congressman
to
give
him
an
office
improperly?
and
so,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
was
paid
or
not
paid
whether
anybody
else
would
know
about
it
or
not,
at
that
moment,
was
mr.
shirey
trying
to
corrupt
the
congressman
to
sell
a
public
office.
he
may
have
in
his
heart
never
intended
to
make
the
first
contribution,
but
was
he
offering
to
buy
a
public
office.
we
think
that
the
reading
of
the
information
would
indicate
that
he
was
offering
to
buy
a
public
office.
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i'm
sorry,
sir,
i
can't
add
the
--
mr.
malcolm
anderson
i
think
that
should
always
apply.
i
have
no
objection
of
that
rule.
i
don't
see
that
it
applies
here.
i
think
there
are
things
that
should
be
said.
i
think
this
man
should
not
have
been
hovering
of
whether
he's
guilty
or
not
guilty
for
six-year
or
four
years
that
he's
been
on
the
distance
of
punishment
perhaps
he
should
not
have
had,
but
i
think
that's
not
our
problem
today.
i
do
see
though
that
there
are
many
items
needs
be
seen
involved
in
this
case.
