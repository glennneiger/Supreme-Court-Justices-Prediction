he
promised
it
to
him
as
a
conduct,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
conduct
of
the
promise
said
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
promised
to
him
that
he
would
give
$1000
to
some
x.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
promise
run
through
the
congressman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whoever
paid
for
policies,
the
statute
if
it
--
if
the
statute
merely
--
well,
whoever
pays,
any
person
for
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
then
it
would
be
sustainable,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
vis-à-vis
shirey,
this
would
be
the
appellee,
the
congressman
of
the
republican
party,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
“thing
of
value”
gets
a
color
for
money
namely,
that
it
has
a
monetary
content?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
the
phrase
of
“thing
of
value”
is
standing
by
itself
may
have
a
latitude
of
meaning
that
it
may
not
add
which
is
joined
through
though
it
is
injunctive
with
money?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
strange
difference
and
it's
odd
to
me
on
a
casual
reading
between
the
first
and
second
paragraph
of
215.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
both
the
214
and
the
215
have
any
money
or
a
thing
of
value?
but
the
next
and
the
second
solicits
and
receives
any
thing
of
value
in
consideration
agency,
a
money
that's
out
there
altogether.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
being
--
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
obvious
what
that
--
they
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
to
know
on
what
committee
the
--
did
this
come
out
in
the
judiciary
committee
or
some
other
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
ought
from
here.
it
looks
as
if
they
were
rational
and
carefully
considered
--
considerations
in
favor
and
very
often
the
--
actually,
they're
the
one
actually
considered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
both
houses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
judicial
notice
is
dictating
that
the
congressman
was
a
republican?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
congressional
directory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
if
a
part
from
other
difficulty
to
demanding
to
represent
if
an
offer
or
promise
of
money
was
made
to
a
republican
congressman
and
he
drastically
thinking
that
the
democratic
party
has
disadvantage
in
the
funds
and
can
get
--
issue
his
money
as
a
subject
and
gives
it
to
the
democratic
party,
does
that
come
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
a
money
actually
was
given
to
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
a
republican
congress
with
the
understanding
to
give
or
nor
give
it
to
the
democratic
treasurer
or
to
the
national
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
because
he
is
a
highlighted
man
who
likes
to
have
opponents
to
be
about
equally
matched
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
they
don't
have
the
democratic
office
to
tell
a
bit
more
than
it
were
the
other
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
we
have
$1000
given
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
must
--
the
point
i
want
to
raise
whether
the
--
whether
--
we
have
to
bother
about
judicial
notice.
if
it
gives
you
a
congressman,
assume
--
assume
all
of
the
difficulties
that
you
are
raising
or
will
raise
were
not
in
the
case.
suppose
you
had
an
outright
to
give
for
a
$1000
to
the
republican
congressman
with
the
understanding
if
he's
going
to
give
it
to
a
democratic
fund.
the
fact
that
either
republican,
the
ultimate
beneficiary
of
the
democrat,
the
opposing
body
would
make
any
difference,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
it
would
be
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
he
can
spend
it
and
he
gives
a
$1000
to
red
cross
or
to
whoever
the
democratic
treasure
is
would
make
any
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cohen,
you
really
surprised
me
in
so
far
as
its
relevance
whether
we
could
or
should
rather
take
judicial
notice
to
the
party
affiliation
of
the
congressman
that
you
exclude
that
from
the
scope
of
judicial
notice.
i
should
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
surprised
at
it
because
it
seems
to
be
who
are
the
occupants
of
the
public
office.
i
could
take
judicial
notice,
i
should
think
who
is
the
new
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania,
so
i
suspect
most
people
in
this
room
would
know
who
it
was.
i
happened
to
have
interest
in
that
fact
but
i
could
simply
take
judicial
notice
if
i
never
heard
of
the
occupant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
to
say
and
i
couldn't
go
to
the
congressional
directory
stipulated
in
the
indictment
is
--
this
information
was
filed
in
a
locality
where
a
lot
of
them
can
be
taking
judicial
notice.
what
is
the
whole
point?
you
do
notice
to
give
me
they're
earnest
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
statute
itself
--
either
pays
or
offers
to
pay.
in
other
words,
if
a
congressman
is
a
approached
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
with
a
promise
of
$1,000
or
a
jaguar
car,
and
he
repels
it,
then
he
repels
it,
that's
an
offense,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
according
to
you,
nothing
--
nobody
knows
what
a
thing
of
value
to
him
because
it's
merely
an
offer
may
not
eventually.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
indictment
and
you
asked
us
to
pass
likely
of
course
upon
the
indictment.
the
indictment
explicitly
alleges
the
offense
as
being
a
promise
to
contribute
$1,000
to
be
sure
that
the
republican
party
has
to
convey.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
indictment
doesn't
turn
on
mr.
anderson's
argument
the
thing
of
value
but
he
is
entitled
for
the
indictments
to
be
judged
by
this
court
on
the
basis
of
whatever
is
fairly
chargeable
under
the
allegations
of
the
information
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
whole
case
is
--
is
switched
around
and
when
discussing
the
thing
of
value
and
the
indictment
doesn't
talk
about
the
thing
of
value.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
still
leaves
open
whether
the
information
isn't
sustainable
as
an
offer
of
$1000
to
this
congressman
to
be
sure
the
beneficiary
which
was
to
be
the
republican
executive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
it
was.
the
direction
of
the
money
was
a
third
person
but
the
whole
--
the
whole
doctrine
of
dead
body
beneficiaries,
the
one
man
makes
a
promise
which
the
other
fellow
to
get
the
full
benefit.
a
promise
is
made
by
or
two
fellow
written
on
the
benefit
by
the
promise
or
the
execution
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
indictment
says
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
is
an
unrelated
character.
he's
one
--
after
all,
we
--
innocence
as
we
are
on
the
court,
we
must
know
that
the
party
operate
certain
officials
to
members
of
congress
that
if
they
do
promise
a
congressman
$1000
to
go
to
the
party,
but
he
isn't
an
innocent
bystander,
he
has
some
relation
to
it.
he
is,
by
event
let's
say
the
candidate
of
this
eventual
$1000.
you
can't
--
of
course
you
can,
as
long
as
you
can
send
them
a
check
with
the
treasurer,
but
politically,
that
isn't
the
way
business
is
done
in
these
localities
is
it?
or
can
we
take
judicial
notice
of
how
far
this
operates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
really
--
you
suggested
ought
to
be
more
interested
that
i
think
we
really
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
denote.
justice
felix
frankfurter
charities
are
frequently
given.
a
promise
is
made
to
jones
in
the
name
of
so
and
so.
for
one
reason
or
other,
people
either
for
duly
interested
reasons
or
for
other
reasons
like
there
have
the
charity
in
the
name
of
somebody,
but
they
promises
to
the
collector.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
marked
my
word
the
other
way
around
since
way
it
really
required
in
malum
prohibitum
and
it
is
such
a
threatening
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
isn't
--
i'm
suggesting
that
it
makes
it
less
derogatory
to
be
convicted
under
it.
punishment
isn't
as
severe
as
a
severe
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
go
on
that
generality,
the
general
propositions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
it's
a
common
law
to
bribe
a
member
of
the
house
of
common,
probably
it
was
a
common
law
then
to
being
under
the
generality
of
offenses
that
is
inimical
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
cavalry
of
the
kingdom.
