justice
potter
stewart
then
i
think
the
legislative
history
that
points
either
direction
as
to
the
distinction
between
the
solicitation
and
the
offering
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
the
coverage?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
welcome.
is
that
your
answer
to
the
question?
you
said
that
under
the
arguments
that
you've
made,
it
would
be
possible
to
consider
a
promise
to
make
a
contribution
to
a
charity
as
a
thing
of
value,
but
you
argued
that
we
must
count
on
prosecuting
officials
and
judges
and
juries,
not
to
reach
ridiculous
results
as
possibly
support
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
but
would
it
not
in
that
case
be
necessary
for
the
information
to
allege?
why
and
how
the
contribution
to
the
red
cross
or
the
parch
of
dimes
or
whatever
would
be
a
thing
of
value
to
the
promises
to
the
congressman?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
sufficient
information
or
indictment
simply
to
allege
that
john
smith
promised
congressman
jones
to
give
a
$1000
to
the
red
cross?
justice
potter
stewart
congressman
jones
is
supporting
him
--?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
information
alleged
that
congressman
jones
is
very
ambitious
to
be
elected
head
of
the
red
cross
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
information
could
spell
it
out
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
the
information
have
to
spell
it
out
or
it
would
be
sufficient
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
privilege
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
by
that,
to
say
the
thing
of
value
means
it's
something
tangible?
justice
potter
stewart
so
money
is
paid
until
people
hand
and
tell
for
those
people
to
know
that
it
was
congressman
who
was
responsible
for
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
the
rule
of
cases
like
bell
against
united
states,
the
recent
--
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
of
lenity
so-called
or
the
criminal
statute
is
ambiguous
resulted
to
ambiguity
in
favor
of
the
common
law.
