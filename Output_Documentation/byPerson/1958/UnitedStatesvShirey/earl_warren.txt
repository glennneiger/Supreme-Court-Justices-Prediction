number

united
states
of
america,
appellant,
versus
george
donald
shirey,
mr.
anderson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
anderson,
i
think
i'm
bothered
too
the
same
way
as
justice
whittaker.
why
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
come
in
under
the
phrase,
“thing
of
value”
rather
than
money
if
he
promise
a
$1000
to
congressman
stauffer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
understood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
the
$1000
to
have
been
paid
through
congressman
stauffer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
because
it
was
not
--
because
congressman
stauffer
was
not
to
be
the
conduct
for
the
money.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
reason
you
say
that
he
was
promised
a
thing
of
value
rather
than
the
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps,
you
can
finish
the
answer
after
lunch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cohen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
collins,
supposed
the
information
merely
charged
that
the
offer
was
made
to
congressman
stauffer
to
give
a
4100,000
--
or
to
give
a
$1000
a
year
to
john
dough,
would
it
be
necessary
in
the
information
to
allege
the
nexus
that
you
say
it
is
not
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
the
congressman
and
john
dough?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
would
be
your
authority
for
that?
now,
i
may
be
a
little
sense
of
it
because
the
pleading
i've
had
experienced
within
the
state
courts
at
least
have
been
very
simple.
it
can
--
we
can
say
a
stole
so
many
dollars
from
b,
e.
a
murdered
b.
a
did
so
and
so
to
c
and
it
never
been
considered
that
that
wasn't
adequate
pleading.
now,
in
this
case,
why
wouldn't
this
be
a
matter
of
proof
in
the
case,
what
the
relationship
was
between
congressman
stauffer
and
the
john
doe
that
the
$1000
a
year
is
to
--
is
to
go
to.
perhaps,
it
might
be
wholly
innocent.
there
might
be
no
connection
at
all
and
maybe
--
maybe
the
jury
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
find
that
it
was
anything
of
value
to
the
congressman,
but
on
the
same
reasoning,
why
wouldn't
be
hear
be
able
to
say
what
the
--
the
matter
of
proof,
what
the
relationship
between
the
congressman
and
the
republican
party
was
and
whether
or
not
the
monetary
thing
of
value.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
here?
isn't
it
that
to
the
fact
that
someone
promises
to
pay
some
money
to
get
a
federal
job?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
matter,
rather
common
knowledge
that
if
a
congressman
can
appoint
the
postmaster
of
his
--
of
his
home
city
that
it
can
help
him
very
greatly
in
his
politics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
he's
contributing
$1000
to
--
to
the
party
that's
in
power,
$1000
a
year
during
the
time
the
man
is
in
the
office,
wouldn't
that
--
couldn't
that
contribute
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
it
will
get
back
to
the
same
question.
isn't
that
evidentiary?
isn't
that
a
matter
that
they
might
--
they
might
require
proof
of
that?
i
don't
know
if
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
he
might
require
proof
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
something
further
mr.
anderson?
