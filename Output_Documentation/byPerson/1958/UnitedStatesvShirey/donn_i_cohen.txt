mr.
donn
i.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
an
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
question
in
this
act
did
come
from
the
judiciary
committee.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
at
least
in
the
house
of
representative,
sir.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
an
answer
to
the
question
presented
with
regard
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
on
what
the
government
contends
as
its
main
position,
and
this
contention
that
is
its
main
position
appears
at
page
10
of
the
government's
brief
where
they
say,
“our
main
position
is
that
the
offer
to
an
individual
(congressman
stauffer)
to
contribute
money
to
his
political
party
(the
republican
party)
is
an
offer
of
thing
of
value
to
the
individual
person
in
the
prohibition
of
18
usc
214.”
this
does
not
take
into
account
the
requirements
of
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
(7)(c),
which
states
that
the
indictment
or
information
shall
be
a
plain
concise
and
a
definite
written
statement
of
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged.
and
when
the
rule
says
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged,
i
presume
that
they
mean
all
of
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charge
and
not
just
the
selection
of
them.
now,
the
government
would
have
this
court
conclude
from
the
fact
that
we
have
an
offer
to
donate
a
$1000
to
the
republican
party
to
use
as
they
see
fit.
ipso
facto,
that
is
a
thing
of
value
to
congressman
stauffer.
it
may
or
may
not
be
a
thing
of
value
to
congressman
stauffer.
these
funds
contributed
to
the
republican
party
may
indeed
be
used
against
them
if
you
were
not
in
favor
with
the
--
in
favor
with
the
recipient
of
those
funds.
but
the
important
thing
is
not
whether
it
is
used
for
or
against
them,
but
initially,
the
important
thing
is
whether
there
is
any
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
he
stood
in
anyway,
whatsoever,
to
benefit
from
the
contribution
of
these
funds,
the
republican
party.
it
is
not
inherent.
it
is
not
like
the
rule
of
gravity.
the
money
contributed
to
a
political
party
enure
to
the
benefit
of
a
congressman,
though
he
be
of
that
party.
i
am
sure
that
these
moneys
did
not
enure
to
the
benefit
of
joseph
martin
or
any
other
member
of
the
house
of
representatives.
they
may
have
enured
to
the
benefit
of
congressman
stauffer,
they
may
not
have,
but
the
point
initially
is
that
in
the
information
and
it's
not
alleged
that
they
did.
and
no
nexus,
no
nexus
whatever
is
said
forth
in
the
information
between
congressman
stauffer
and
the
republican
party.
they're
completely
separate
and
they
are
not
connected
in
any
way.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
if
the
court
please,
i
know
have
no
authority
and
the
government
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that
fact.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
even
if
it
could,
your
honor,
even
if
it
could
take
judicial
notice
that
it
is
--
that
the
--
the
congressman
is
a
republican.
could
it
take
also
judicial
notice
of
the
(inaudible)
facts
which
would
have
to
show
that
these
were
a
thing
of
value
to
him?
if
this
court
--
if
this
information
has
alleged
that
an
offer
of
$1000
was
given
to
the
xyz
corporation
of
which
congressman
stauffer
was
a
stockholder,
a
common
stockholder,
under
that
sub
position
of
facts,
conceivably,
we
could
say
that
it
is
inherently
true
that
an
offer
to
contribute
money
to
a
corporation
is
a
value
to
a
stockholder,
a
common
stockholder
of
any
rate
of
such
a
corporation.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
if
the
--
if
the
offer
were
to
give
money
to
the
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
republican
congressman.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
and
it
was
the
republican's
congress
whose
--
congressman
whose
influence
was
solicited?
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
shall
not
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
should
not
think
that
that
would
be
a
thing
of
value
to
the
republican
congressman.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
then
--
then
it
would
be
money
and
come
under
that
section.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
a
thing
of
value
to
him.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
it
would
be
money
to
him,
yes.
and
in
that
regard,
it
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
no,
not
on
that
part.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
yes.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
yes.
absolutely,
that
is
our
decision.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
my
authority
for
that,
your
honor,
is
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
7(c)
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
--
which
quite
specifically
says
that
the
information
shall
be
a
definite
written
statement
of
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
here,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
an
offer
or
promise
of
money
or
a
thing
or
value
to
a
person,
firm,
or
corporation.
and
the
defendant's
position
is
that
the
information
must
allege
somewhere
that
there
was
a
thing
of
value
offered
to
a
person,
firm,
or
corporation,
taking
the
government's
main
position.
and
if
there
is
no
allegation,
either
by
conclusionary
words
such
as
the
use
of
the
word
“thing
or
value”
or
by
statement
of
facts
to
the
--
to
show
the
relationship
between
one
and
another,
then
a
crime
has
not
been
stated.
to
give
money
to
another
person
is
not
a
crime.
it
is
only
a
crime
in
the
event
that
that
other
person,
using
the
government's
posture
this
case
stands
the
benefit
from
that
gift,
and
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
and
the
information
whatsoever
indicating
in
anyway,
that
congressman
stauffer
stood
to
benefit
from
that
gift.
and
i
am
using
the
word
“stand
to
benefit”
now,
because
the
government
seems
to
construe
the
words
“thing
or
value”
as
meaning
stand
to
benefit,
which
i
don't
believe
they
do.
but
taking
the
government's
position
at
least
on
that
point,
the
information
must
show
because
its
--
it
is
an
essential
fact
of
the
offense
charged
that
there'd
be
a
thing
of
value
and
to
be
a
thing
of
value
to
congressman
stauffer
under
their
consideration.
now,
there
is
nothing
here
to
show
that
congressman
stauffer
benefit
in
any
way
whatsoever
and
therefore,
now
crime
is
stated.
we
can
suppose
that
he
might
benefit.
we
can
suppose
that
all
of
the
republican
party
would
take
this
money
or
the
recipients
of
these
funds
and
put
it
into
his
campaign
or
future
campaign
for
congress,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
information
stated
indicating
that.
all
we
have
now
is
an
offer
of
money
to
the
republican
party,
ipso
facto,
the
government's
contention
is
that
that's
a
thing
of
value
to
s.
walter
stauffer.
there
is
no
connection
between
the
two.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
would
think
that
the
information
would
have
to
indicate
that
there
was
some
value
accruing
to
congressman
stauffer
as
a
result
of
that
gift
to
his
son.
this
is
closer
of
course.
we
can
more
readily
assume
that
a
gift
to
a
son
is
a
gift,
but
if
congressman
stauffer
is
alienated
from
his
son,
and
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
matter
of
proof
as
being
suggested.
i
think
this
is
an
essential
fact
necessary
to
constitute
the
offense
charged,
because
we
must
have
charge
that
a
thing
of
value
was
offered
or
promised.
and
if
the
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
the
point
and
i
think
if
these
facts
and
the
information
were
proven
and
only
these
facts
were
proven,
a
crime
would
not
have
been
committed
because
under
that
posture,
you
would
not
know
one
way
or
the
other
whether
it
was
a
thing
of
value.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
republicans
sometimes
do
benefit
from
contributions
to
the
party
and
sometimes,
it
hurts
them,
and
sometimes
it's
completely
neutral.
and
i
think
if
we're
going
to
pin
the
statute
down
and
call
for
it
and
it
calls
for
an
offer
of
a
thing
of
value,
then
the
information
was
alleged
that
there
was
a
thing
of
value
offered
to
s.
walter
stauffer.
and
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
alleged,
and
therefore,
insufficient
under
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
7(c)
insufficient
because
it
does
not
state
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged.
now,
with
regard
to
the
statute
itself
aside
from
the
sufficiency
of
the
information,
the
thing
of
value
contemplated
by
the
government
is
quite
different
from
what
the
defendant
believes
the
thing
of
value
contemplated
by
the
united
states
congress
was.
in
the
first
place,
the
word
“thing
of
value”
follows
to
word
“money,”
and
it
is
given
some
coloration
by
that
word.
now,
the
defendant
readily
admits
that
the
word
“thing
of
value”
is
a
broad
thing,
as
a
broad
connotation
but
it
has
to
be
something
measurable
and
not
the
illusory
meaning
that
the
government
would
give
to
it.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
this
--
this,
your
honor,
is
what
--
is
the
--
is
substantially
the
same
question
that
was
asked
if
we
take
judicial
notice
of
the
party
affiliation
of
this
claim.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
if
that
were
in
the
indictment
itself,
it
would
still
be
insufficient.
our
position
is
that
it
must
be
shown
that
it
is
a
thing
of
value,
otherwise,
it's
not
a
crime.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
some
times
it
would
benefit
him
as
a
thing
of
value
and
we
can
hypothesize
a
the
government
would
have
it
hypothesized,
at
page
14
of
its
brief
when
it
says,
“it
is
obvious
that
it
would
be
a
great
value
to
a
congressman
to
be
the
person
responsible
for
obtaining
such
contributions.”
indeed,
the
increasing
party
funds
might
well
be
available
for
a
future
campaign
of
its
own.
they
might
well
be
available
and
they
might
not
well
be
available,
but
the
point
is
it's
not
alleged
in
the
information
that
any
thing
of
value
accrued
to
congressman
stauffer.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
i
didn't
want
to
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
it's
readily
available,
your
honor,
the
information
as
to
the
party
affiliation
but
--
and
i
would
not
press
that
point
too
hard,
but
i
would
say
that
if
and
if
judicial
notice
were
taken
to
a
party
affiliation
of
congressman
stauffer,
that
no
nexus
is
established
in
this
information
indicating
any
relationship
between
these
funds
allegedly
contributed
to
the
republican
party
in
any
benefit
that
he
might
stand
in
that
allegation
under
rule
7(c)
is
and
essential
allegation
to
constitute
the
offense
charged.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
the
--
the
fact
that
he
has
that
--
that
patronage
at
his
disposal
and
quite
naturally,
it
would
help
him
in
his
political
problem.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
it
could,
it
could
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
must
be
alleged
that
it
did
in
the
information.
that's
our
position.
that
is
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
think
not.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
think
not
because
i
think
that
is
an
essential
fact
to
constitute
the
offense
charged.
with
regard
now
to
the
statute
itself
and
what
is
a
thing
of
value.
i
submit
that
that
has
given
some
coloration
by
the
word
“money”
and
that
while
it
is
a
broad
concept,
it
is
at
least
something
measurable.
now,
the
government's
position
is
that
it
would
inure
congressman
stauffer's
benefit
some
time
in
the
future
and
therefore
is
a
thing
of
value.
and
i
think
the
government
argued
basically
the
thing
of
value
and
inured
to
the
benefit
of
another
or
one
in
the
same,
and
i
think
they
are
not.
for
if
the
government's
example
were
correct,
the
examples
they
give
at
page
14
of
their
brief,
then
if
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
offered
to
work
hard
as
a
postmaster,
in
consideration
or
receiving
that
appointment,
it
would,
under
the
government's
contention
the
equal
thing
value
and
i
don't
think
congress
intended
prescription
to
that
effect.
also,
money
was
not
paid
here.
it
was
only
offered
and
in
order
to
prove
these
benefits
which
the
government
conflicts
as
inuring
to
congressman
stauffer,
payment
would
have
in
fact
had
to
be
made.
one
proof
of
this
case,
under
this
--
under
this
information
in
any
rate,
all
we
have
is
an
offer.
you
can
never
know
whether
it
was
or
it
only
did
turn
into
a
thing
of
value
to
congressman
stauffer.
and
finally,
we
have
an
offer
of
money,
$1,000
a
year
to
the
republican
party
to
use
as
they
see
fit.
now,
that
is
used
in
money
or
thing
of
value
in
its
injunctive
sense
and
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
when
you
have
an
information
plainly
alleging
offer
of
money,
then
substantiate
that
information
as
an
offer
with
thing
of
value.
with
regard
to
these
two
points
stand
are
in
a
sense
distinguishable.
they
are,
one,
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
and
secondly,
even
assuming
the
information
is
sufficient,
the
words
--
the
meaning
that
the
government
would
seek
to
give
the
word,
“thing
of
value,“
is
not
the
meaning
intended
by
congress.
it
is
something
i
think
measurable
and
not
something
so
illusory
and
true
by
only
such
as
secured
as
fashion.
and
i
believe
the
fact
that
we
are
construing
a
penal
statute
here
which
requires
its
construction
in
strict
terms
substantiates
this
position
and
limits
the
meaning
of
the
words,
“thing
of
value”
to
something
at
least
measurable.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
not
necessarily
tangible
but
measurable
in
some
way.
the
benefits
that
are
going
to
accrue
to
congressman
stauffer,
assuming
they
do
accrue,
as
contemplated
by
the
government,
are
not
at
all
measurable
and
they
are
not
going
to
accrue
until
money
is
actually
paid,
and
this
information
does
not
allege
any
payment.
it
only
alleges
an
operative
pay.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
and
then
or
--
either
until
money
is
paid
or
until
it's
generally
known
that
he
is
the
big
collector
of
party
funds,
thus
raising
his
stature.
i
don't
think
this
was
in
the
contemplation
of
congress
in
enacting
a
penal
statute
and
the
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
yes.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
that's
an
offense,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
the
thing
of
value
which
the
government
contemplates
here
is
not
money.
it's
an
offer
to
congressman
stauffer
of
these
benefits
which
they
contemplate
accruing
on
page
14
of
their
brief.
that
is
what's
being
offered
to
him.
no
money
is
being
offered
to
congressman
stauffer.
on
page
14
of
their
brief,
they
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
yes.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
exactly,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
and
i
think
this
was
not
in
the
contemplation
of
the
united
states
attorney
when
the
indictment
was
drafted,
nor
is
it
even
discussed
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
this
thing
of
value
argument.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
now
the
--
the
act
itself
--
the
act
itself
reads,
“whoever
pays
or
offers
or
promises
any
money
or
thing
of
value,
to
any
person.”
now,
if
you
take
out
the
unnecessary
words
under
this
particular
case,
it
would
read,
“"whoever
offers
or
promises
any
money
to
any
person.”
now,
no
money
was
offered
or
promised
to
s.
walter
stauffer.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
if
your
honor
please,
our
position
is
that
there
was
not
an
offer
or
promise
of
money
to
s.
walter
stauffer.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
the
indictment
says
that
there
is
an
operative
promise
that
s.
walter
stauffer
to
donate
$1000
a
year
to
the
republican
party
and
we
do
not
construe
that
as
thing
of
offer
or
promise
of
money
to
s.
walter
stauffer.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
don't
know
whether
we
can
take
judicial
notice
to
that
fact.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
i
don't
suggest
him
to
be
innocent.
i
only
suggest
that
if
the
indictment
says
an
offer
or
promise
of
money
to
a
person,
a
firm,
or
corporation
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
--
that
it
must
--
that
it
must
offer
money
to
a
person,
firm,
or
corporation
and
congressman
stauffer,
being
a
person,
if
there
was
an
offer
of
money
to
congressman
stauffer
would
have
been
a
crime.
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
i
don't
think
that
would
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
government
at
one
point
has
argued
that
the
republican
party
is
a
person
and
therefore,
regardless
of
the
other
arguments
thus
made
that
this
is
an
offer
of
money
to
a
person
and
they
conclude
this
by
an
application
of
title
i
section
1
of
the
united
states
code
which
defines
person
to
include
such
words
as,
“partnership,
firm,
corporation,
association,
joint
stock
company,
or
society,”
then
they
take
from
that
and
to
plant
association
into
the
word
“person”
in
18
u.s.c.
214.
and
the
question
is,
is
this
supplantable
because
1
u.s.c.
1
specifically
says
that
these
meanings
described
to
the
word
“person”
apply
only
in
less
--
apply
unless
the
context
indicates
otherwise.
and
it's
the
position
of
the
defendant
to
the
context
of
18
u.s.c.
214
does
indicate
otherwise
and
that
immediately,
following
the
word
“person”
in
18
u.s.c.
214,
come
the
words
“firm
or
corporation”.
now,
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
this
exhaust
of
specification
would
exclude
further
entity
by
implication.
and
also,
the
fact
that
the
word
“firm
and
corporation”
are
also
mentioned
in
191
u.s.c.
1,
if
we
take
the
meanings
described
in
1
u.s.c.
1
and
apply
it
to
18
u.s.c.
214,
then
the
words
“firm
and
corporation”
in
title
18
section
214
united
states
code
become
complete
superfluous.
and
it
is
submitted
that
congress
would
not
place
in
the
statute
words
which
would
intends
to
be
superfluous.
finally,
i
think
we
must
recall
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
penal
or
criminal
statute,
and
that
statute
requires
strict
construction.
the
rule
of
strict
construction
is
the
reason
as
the
decision
of
this
court
in
december
of
this
year
in
which
justice
douglas
and
its
decent
referred
to
united
states
versus
wiltberger
with
approval
and
applied
the
rule
of
strict
construction.
that
case
was
united
states
versus
a
&
p
trucking
company
and
hopelet
trucking
company.
but
not
only
is
this
a
criminal
statute,
but
it
is
a
peculiar
criminal
statute
and
that
it
would
seem
to
involve
a
crime
which
is
truly
the
creature
of
the
congress
that
it
is,
in
short,
malum
prohibitum
and
not
mala
prohibita
as
said,
and
that
therefore
the
rule
of
strict
construction
applies
with
even
greater
strength.
and
finally,
the
act
of
making
political
contribution
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
there's
no
mandatory
required
in
this
act
except
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
oh,
i
shouldn't
think
that
the
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
well,
these
generalities
aren't
very
helpful
usually
but
i
think
it's
applied
to
this
case
where
you
do
have
a
crime
that
is
--
does
not
have
any
common
law
or
inherent
moral
background
to
it.
that
--
the
strict
construction
rule
should
apply
more
strongly.
and
finally,
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
--
mr.
donn
i.
cohen
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
in
the
act
in
and
of
itself
with
which
we
are
dealing,
namely
the
act
of
making
a
political
contribution
assigned
for
the
moment
or
the
purposes
for
which
that
act
may
be
done
is
in
of
itself
laudatory
act
and
while
certainly
it
may
be
proscribed
and
certainly
under
certain
conditions,
it
is
wrong.
if
that
proscription
is
to
be
made,
it
would
seem
that
it
should
in
explicit
terms.
and
the
comparison
between
18
u.s.c.
214
and
18
u.s.c.
215,
the
latter
in
which
a
section
does
contain
an
explicit
proscription
would
seem
to
indicate
that
congress
do
not
intend
the
proscription
of
political
contributions
in
the
context
of
18
u.s.c.
214.
for
these
reasons
therefore,
the
defense
submit,
number
one,
that
the
information
is
insufficient
to
allege
a
crime
under
title
18
section
214
united
states
code
because
it
does
not
contain
the
essential
facts
necessary
to
constitute
the
offense
charged
and
that
there
is
no
allegation
that
a
thing
of
value
was
offered
to
congressman
stauffer.
and
secondly,
even
if
it
were
sufficient,
in
other
words,
even
if
all
the
essential
facts
stated
were
there,
the
construction
placed
on
the
statute
by
the
government
gives
two
broader
meaning
to
words
“thing
of
value”
and
gives
an
inappropriate
meaning
to
the
word,
“republican
party”.
now,
i
might
mention
at
this
point
also
that
the
republican
party
is
not
identified
as
being
in
association
or
a
person
in
the
information.
and
if
this
offer
or
if
the
proscribed
offer
would
be
to
a
retail
shoe
store,
then
it
must
be
alleged
that
it
was
a
retail
shoe
store
in
the
information
and
we
have
no
knowledge
whatsoever
as
to
the
nature
of
the
republican
party.
it
is
not
alleged
in
the
information
and
on
that
ground,
the
information
is
insufficient
aside
from
the
fact
that
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
the
republican
party
is
not
an
association
but
rather
a
concept.
thank
you.
