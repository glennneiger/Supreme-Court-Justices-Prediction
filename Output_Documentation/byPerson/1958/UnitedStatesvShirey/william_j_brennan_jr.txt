brennan,

i
think
it's
sort
of
a
victim
of
a
shuttlecock
or
barrel
door
they
squatly
want
to
particularize
and
probably
don't
want
to
particularize
enough
and
therefore
generalize
and
you
fail
to
get
a
hodgepodge
of
obscurity
or
at
least
the
irrationality
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
information
that
alleged
that
the
defendant
promised
to
give
$1000
a
year
to
congressman
stauffer's
son?
would
that
be
enough
or
would
you
have
to
--
where
the
information
and
you
--
you
have
to
spell
out
how
and
why
this
would
be
a
thing
a
value
to
the
congressman?
