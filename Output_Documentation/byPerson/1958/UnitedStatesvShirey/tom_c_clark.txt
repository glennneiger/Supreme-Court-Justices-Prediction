did
congress
say
that
of
what
you
said
about
a
thing?
justice
tom
c.

(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
question
though
is
what
congress
might
offer
to
what
you
have
said,
or
what
you
have
insisted.
justice
tom
c.
clark
why?
(inaudible)
as
this
person
offers
any
money
or
other
thing
of
value?
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
they
did
that
and
then
--
the
information
that
the
congressman
was
being
a
member
of
the
republican
party.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
said
it
could.
i
say
suppose
they
put
in
the
indictment
itself.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
it
shows
some
time
between
he
and
the
party
receiving
the
money.
