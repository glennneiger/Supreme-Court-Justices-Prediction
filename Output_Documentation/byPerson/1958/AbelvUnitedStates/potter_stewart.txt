justice
potter
stewart
it
--
you
vindicated
that
in
your
view
at
this
time,
the
f.b.i.
did
have
information
sufficient
under
this
court's
decisions
in
brinegar
and
draper
to
themselves,
effecting
arrest
without
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
--
in
your
view
could
have
arrested
him
and
made
a
search
incident
to
that
arrest
at
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
--
perhaps
my
question
wasn't
clear,
was
this,
that
forgetting
now,
the
i.n.s.
just
a
few
minutes
ago,
we
tried
to
insulate
the
f.b.i.
just
assuming
these
f.b.i.
agents
had
been
there,
it's
your
position,
i
think,
that
they,
the
f.b.i.
agents
at
that
time,
had
evidence
sufficient
under
this
court's
decisions,
draper
most
recently,
themselves,
to
effect
a
lawful
arrest
for
this
man
at
that
time,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
also
follow
that
in
connection
with
that
lawful
arrest,
they
could've
made
a
search
incident
to
that
arrest,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
the
point
in
your
answer
that
if
--
that
if
they
haven't
made
that
kind
of
an
arrest,
the
kind
that
was
made
in
draper,
then
this
man
would
have
been
--
there
would
have
been
sued
all
sorts
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
protection,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
this
done,
mr.
rankin,
the
time
of
the
search
--
does
it
have
to
be
done
or
only
at
that
time
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
attacks
the
legality
of
the
search?
justice
potter
stewart
couldn't
that
also
prove
at
least
one
criminal
offense,
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
criminal
offenses
did
it
prove,
the
failure
to
register
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
attorney
general.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
misdemeanor
carrying
how
much
year
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
illegal
entry
itself
is
also
a
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
no
--
no
prior
--
there
was
no
actual
effort
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
prosecute
him
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
man
now
is
under
a
deportation
order,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
which
came
first,
the
--
well,
the
deportation
hearing
was
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
coming
from
the
district
of
connecticut.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
general,
surely
in
a
case
of
this
kind
involving
a
man
allegedly
with
his
identity,
the
matter
must
have
gone
pretty
high
into
the
justice
department
for
a
decision,
did
it
not?
what's
the
record
showing
that?
justice
potter
stewart
my
--
my
last
--
my
question
was
directed
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
your
--
what
you've
told
us
about
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
which
were
accepted
--
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
a
good
faith
decision
on
the
part
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
people
to
effect
this
arrest,
that
there
was
evidence
of
corroboration
between
that
part
of
the
justice
department
and
between
the
f.b.i.,
another
part
of
the
justice
department,
but
the
one
was
not
acting
as
the
secret
agent
of
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
wondering
if
--
if
there
was
any
effort
in
addition
to
that
of
--
of
--
if
there
was
any
evidence
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
cooperation,
if
there
was
any
evidence
of
coordination
by
somebody
above
each
of
these
departments
using
one
where
it
would
be
useful
and
the
other
where
it
would
be
useful.
is
there
any
such
evidence
out
of
coordination
from
above?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
don't
accept
the
theory
of
the
petitioner
that
the
record
shows
that
what
the
government
perhaps
really
had
in
mind
was
the
hope
that
this
man,
abel,
might
cooperate
with
the
government
and
become
a
dual
agent
for.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
--
you
say
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
affidavit
admitted
in
connection
with
the
motion
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
suppress
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
is
there
--
where
--
where
can
the
--
are
there
any
materials
available
anywhere
in
the
court's
decisions
or
rules
of
the
department
or
anything
else
as
to
--
to
support
your
statement,
which,
of
course,
i
don't
doubt
that
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
standard
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
of
course,
if
there
had
been
that
kind
of
arrest
by
the
f.b.i.,
the
arrest
would
have
been
followed
by
immediately
under
the
criminal
code
of
procedure
by
--
by
an
arraignment
and
under
which
this
man
would
have
had
various
protections.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
from
then
on.
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
including
any
oral
statement
that
they
may
have
made
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
hearing,
he
--
he
admitted
he
was
a
russian
illegally
in
this
country?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
prima
facie
case
for
deportation?
justice
potter
stewart
in
answer
to
a
question
of
justice
harlan's
before
lunch,
you
reminded
us
that
the
failure
to
advice
the
--
was
it
the
secretary
of
state
or
attorney
--
attorney
general
or
at
least
his
presence,
is
not
only
subjects
him
to
deportation
but
also
a
misdemeanor
–
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
the
statute,
under
the
criminal
statute?
would
that
certainly
insofar
as
the
misdemeanor
goes,
an
administrative
arrest
warrant
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
entitle
these
agents
to
enter
his
room
and
arrest
him,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
--
in
order
to
arrest
for
felony,
they
couldn't
certainly
do
it
under
an
administrative
warrant,
could
they?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
private
person.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
law
of
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
law
of
new
york
wouldn't
entitle
a
private
person
to
go
up
and
knock
on
the
door
and
go
in
a
man's
room
and
see
whether
or
not
a
crime
were
being
committed
in
his
presence,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
would
the
law
permit
him
to
visit
the
man's
hotel
room
for
the
very
purpose
and
so
--
only
purpose
of
seeing
whether
or
not
the
crime
was
being
--
was
going
to
be
committed
in
his
presence?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
the
visit
by
the
fbi
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
--
and
the
half
hour
conversation?
justice
potter
stewart
because
martin
collins
–
if
there
was
such
a
person
was
supposedly
born
in
this
country
and
was
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
same
is
true
of
goldfus.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
(inaudible)
proposition,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
--
how
did
they
know
about
the
name
abel
by
this
time
because
hayhanen
only
knew
this
man
as
mark,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
any
where
has
to
--
that
anybody
knew
this
man's
true
name
was
abel
or
one
of
his
names
is
abel?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
in
this
report?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
how
and
when
they
got
into
the
waste
basket?
