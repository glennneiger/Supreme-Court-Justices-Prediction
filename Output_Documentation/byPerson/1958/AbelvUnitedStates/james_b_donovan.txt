mr.
james
b.
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
writ
was
granted
by
this
court
with
respect
to
two
specific
questions
which
are,
(1)
whether
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
is
violated
by
a
search
and
a
the
seizure
of
evidence
without
a
search
warrant,
after
an
alien
suspected
and
officially
accused
of
espionage
has
been
taken
into
custody
for
deportation
pursuant
to
an
administrative
immigration
service
warrant,
but
has
not
been
arrested
for
the
commission
of
a
crime.
and
(2),
whether
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
are
violated
when
articles
so
seized
are
unrelated
to
the
deportation
warrant
and
together
with
other
articles
obtained
from
such
leads,
are
introduced
as
evidence
in
a
prosecution
for
espionage.
the
petitioner,
abel,
was
indicted
on
august
7th,
1957
on
a
three-count
indictment
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
charging,
in
summary,
the
capital
crime
of
conspiring
to
commit
espionage
on
behalf
of
soviet
russia.
abel
is
a
russian
national.
after
a
jury
trial,
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
thirty
years
in
prison,
a
term
that
he's
now
serving
in
the
federal
prison
in
atlanta.
the
conviction,
thereafter,
was
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
will
be
my
contention
today
that
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendments
were
violated
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
which
are
set
forth
by
the
introduction
in
--
to
evidence,
in
this
case,
of
various
materials
that
had
been
seized
pursuant
to
this
administrative
immigration
warrant
and
unsupported
by
any
search
warrant
or
normal
warrant
of
arrest.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
substantially
undisputed
although
there
are
disputes
with
respect
to
the
conclusions,
both
legal
and
factual,
which
that
should
be
drawn
from
those
and
their
various
inferences.
in
early
may
1957,
one,
reino
hayhanen,
entered
the
american
embassy
in
paris
and
stated
that
since
1952,
he
had
been
serving
as
a
lieutenant
colonel
in
russian
secret
intelligence
in
the
united
states
performing
espionage
duties.
he
told
about
the
fact
that
in
the
united
states,
he
reported
to,
as
the
so-called,
"resident
agent,"
a
man
named,
"mark,"
whom
he
did
not
further
identified,
but
who
he
stated
was
a
colonel
in
russian
military
intelligence.
he
also
stated
that
this
man,
while
living
about
in
the
various
cheap
hotels
in
new
york
city,
maintained
an
art
studio
in
brooklyn
which
was
employed
as
a
cover.
hayhanen
was
returned
to
the
united
states
and
his
story
was
promptly
and
very
thoroughly
investigated.
he
took
the
f.b.i.
to
his
home
in
peekskill,
new
york,
where
various
materials,
all
tending
to
connect
him
with
espionage
and
to
give
credence
to
his
story
were
uncovered.
he
furthermore,
with
respect
to
his
statements
concerning,
mark,
subsequently
identified
as
the
petitioner
here,
abel,
the
f.b.i.
at
the
same
time
they
were
investigating
for
corroboration
of
hayhanen's
story,
they
also
began
to
shadow
abel.
they
watched
the
studio.
they
found
out
that
there
was
such
a
man.
that
he
did
maintain
an
art
studio
and
that
meanwhile
he
was
not
living
there.
annexed
to
our
brief,
as
appendix
b,
the
court
will
find
a
compilation
of
all
of
the
various
materials
that
were
in
the
possession
of
the
department
of
justice
and
could
constitute
evidence
of
espionage
prior
to
the
detention
for
deportation
of
abel
which
occurred
on
june
21st.
it
accordingly,
would
be
our
contention
and
not
simply
that
there
was
probable
cause
prior
to
this
apprehension
i'll
describe,
not
simply
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
--
that
the
man
occupying
the
art
studio
and
as
it
turned
out
also
room
839
in
the
hotel
latham,
had
committed
espionage,
but
the
evidence
was
rather
clear
and
convincing
unless
controverted.
this,
of
course,
is
important
in
our
judgment
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
germane
to
the
issue
here,
that
such
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
man
had
committed
the
capital
crime
of
espionage
did
exist.
in
fact,
if
the
court
would
turn
to
the
affidavit
that
was
submitted
by
government
attorney,
maroney,
in
the
district
court,
the
court
will
find
that
--
that
he
very
well
summarizes
this
matter.
it's
on
page
57
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
will
show
that
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
department
of
justice
at
that
time,
the
internal
security
division,
was
that
because
hayhanen
said,
he,
while
he
would
tell
the
story,
must
refuse
to
testify
publicly
for
fear
of
implicating
his
family
in
russia,
that
they
believe
that
they
could
not
successfully
prosecute
for
espionage
at
that
time,
lacking
the
testimony
of
hayhanen
in
open
court.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
in
that
kind
of
detail.
furthermore,
as,
your
honor,
knows
these
warrants
can
be
sealed
and
indeed,
one
was
in
this
case,
so
that
for
a
--
a
period
of
time
this
--
this
could
be
kept
confidential.
but
this
is
not
set
forth
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
government's
brief
in
this
court
as
determined
to
the
question.
mr.
maroney
explains
that
they
believe
that
because
he
wouldn't
testify
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
successfully
prosecute.
now,
under
the
brinegar
case,
and
the
very
recent
draper
case,
unreported
before
the
court,
we
say
that
this
question
is
quite
irrelevant
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
that
there's
just
no
question,
but
that
we
believe
such
a
search
warrant
could
have
been
obtained
on
affidavits
by
the
f.b.i.
agents
as
to
what
they
had
been
informed
and
corroborated
by
this
massive
evidence
which
is
set
forth
in
--
in
exhibit
b
to
our
brief.
now
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
the
department
of
justice,
the
solicitor
general
would
be
much
better
informed
on
this.
needless
to
say,
than
i
would
be,
but
i
can't
point
out
to
your
honor
that
in
this
specific
case,
a
warrant
--
a
search
warrant,
was
obtained
as
the
docket
in
the
case
and
the
very
front
of
our
transcript
will
show.
a
search
warrant
was
obtained
on
june
28th
,
based
upon
affidavits
by
an
f.b.i.
agent
and
an
i.n.s.
agent.
and
it
was
not
until
after
the
man
was
indicted
that
there
was
any
public
disclosure
of
this
matter.
it
was
the
first
public
knowledge
of
it
and
your
honor
will
find
an
entry
in
the
docket
at
the
very
commencement
of
this
transcript
of
august
7th
by
(inaudible)
order
for
sealing
of
search
warrant
and
by
(inaudible)
order
for
opening
of
search
warrant,
affidavits
and
exhibits
file.
so
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
these
search
warrants,
your
honor,
the
actual
search
warrant
issued,
your
honor,
will
find
set
forth
the
recitals
that
were
made
from
pages
47
to
page
55
of
the
transcript.
and
your
honor,
will
find
that
if,
and
as
i'll
advert
to
this
a
little
later,
because
it
is
rather
important
to
show
how
this
search
warrant,
this
latest
search
warrant,
was
completely
based
on
the
latham
search
to
which
we're
objecting.
your
honor,
will
find
that
there's
a
recital
in
here
about
the
fact
of
how
on
june
21st,
goldfus
was
taken
into
custody
and
the
investigation
was
made,
what
was
seized
and
so
on
and
therefore,
they
asked
for
a
search
warrant
to
search
the
art
studio
in
brooklyn
having
completed
this
search
of
the
hotel
room
which
is
the
specific
search
before
this
court.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
these
warrants
were
executed
based
upon
the
information
they
secured
in
the
latham
search
which
was
--
had
--
there
was
no
search
warrant
for
it
whatsoever.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
june
21st,
your
honor.
so
that
on
--
on
june
21st
was
the
latham
search.
june
28th,
these
affidavits
were
made
and
the
warrant
obtained.
the
first
public
disclosure,
the
record
shows,
is
august
7th,
after
his
indictment.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
under
the
brinegar
case
and
under
the
--
under
this
latest
draper
case,
but
as
a
matter
of
--
of
law
long
before
either
of
those
cases,
that
based
upon
everything
that
was
available,
everything
that
was
available
set
forth
in
exhibit
d
in
our
brief.
and
based
upon
what
the
f.b.i.
agents
could
recite
as
to
what
they
had
been
informed
by
this
man
that
there'd
be
no
question
that
they
could
--
that
there
was
probable
cause.
any
reasonable
person
would
have
said
that
--
that
the
--
that
there
was
brave
reason
to
believe
that
the
--
the
man
had
committed
espionage.
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
will
find
that
on
analysis
of
the
--
the
affidavits
that
had
been
submitted
that
it
--
a
fairest
summary
of
what
was
involved
was
that
--
that
on
this
particular
thing
that
they
believed
that
they'd
unsuccessfully
prosecute.
now,
i
wouldn't
necessarily
even
agree
with
that.
but
while
they
do
say
that
the
available
evidence
was
insufficient
to
secure
a
warranted
complaint,
all
that
i
could
say,
your
honor,
is,
i
think,
that
they
misconceive
the
law.
and
i
think
that
the
brinegar
case
and
the
draper
case
make
that
perfectly
evident.
if
the
draper
case
could
be
upheld
in
this
case
where
it
isn't
simply
a
question
of
hearsay
or
anything
else
of
that
kind,
but
every
element
which
led
justice
black
to
dissent
in
the
draper
case
is
clearly
evident
here.
every
--
every
bit
of
the
story
that
had
been
given
to
the
f.b.i.
was
corroborated
by
this
massive
material
set
forth
on
pages
38
to
42
of
our
brief.
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
your
honor,
before
they
ever
searched
abel's
room,
apprehended
him,
or
anything
else,
we're
talking
about
the
fact
that
hayhanen,
to
corroborate
his
story,
had
turned
over
to
them
such
items
as
microfilm
messages,
radio-receiving
headsets,
hollowed-out
coins
to
contain
microfilm
messages
and
a
wide
variety
of
other
things
which
a
normal
person
would
conclude,
would
be
espionage
materials.
now,
having
reached
the
conclusion
then,
that
they
should
act
otherwise
and,
of
course,
in
our
brief,
we
explained
why
we
believe
they
chose
this
cause
of
action,
i
should
like
to
read
what
the
department
of
justice
decided
and
this
is
exceedingly
important.
indeed,
the
--
the
crux
of
this
case,
in
a
great
many
ways,
because
for
one
specific
reason,
it
completely
knocks
out
in
my
judgement
the
--
the
so-called
findings
made
by
the
courts
below,
simply
because
of
a
misconception.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
you
--
your
honor
will
find
that
the
circuit
court
opinion
and
indeed
the
district
court
opinion,
but
the
circuit
court
opinion
at
much
great
length,
dwells
on
the
fact
that
the
i.n.s.
officers
employed
for
a
specific
purpose,
i'll
explain
in
a
minute,
deserves
special
papers
that
they,
in
good
faith,
other
words,
this
is
an
argument
which
go
around
the
harris
case.
that
they,
in
good
faith,
were
performing
the
unlimited
i.n.s.
functions
with
blind
desire.
the
f.b.i.,
so
too,
in
good
faith,
they
were
performing
their
specific
functions
with
blindness
on
those
specific
limited
functions.
but
the
whole
point,
your
honor,
and
may
i
add
then
to
carry
that
further,
both
courts
below
that
it
conclude
that
there's
no
reason
why
each
one
of
these
services,
each
bearing
in
mind
this
specific
jurisdictional
function,
there
was
no
reason
they
should
not
cooperate
together.
now,
the
misconception
that
i'm
explaining
is
that
this
completely
overlooks
the
fact
that
both
of
those
services
are
simply
component
parts
of
the
department
of
justice.
this
entire
thing
is
a
function
of
the
department
of
justice.
what
we
are
complaining
about,
what
indeed
if
this
court
should
find
that
under
the
harris
case,
so-called
good
faith
is
lacking,
it's
not
good
faith
in
the
part
of
the
f.b.i.,
it's
not
good
faith
on
the
part
of
i.n.s.,
obviously,
each
is
performing
is
limited.
but
our
whole
point
is
that
this
was
a
department
of
justice
decision
that
was
made.
both
of
these
components
with
injustice
would
give
in
their
orders
and
it
was
justice
that
made
these
determinations.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
the
united
states
attorney
first,
so
we'd
be
clear
on
this,
is
really
not
involved
in
this.
this
entire
thing
was
handled
--
was
handled
out
of
washington
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
by
a
special
assistant
attorney
general.
if
your
honors
would
turn
please
to
pages
56
and
57
of
the
record,
to
the
affidavit
of
mr.
maroney,
one
of
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
case,
i
believe
your
honors
will
find
that
what
i
have
just
stated
is
completely
borne
out.
your
honors
will
know
--
note
that
in
the
bottom
of
page
56,
mr.
maroney
stated
in
may
of
1957
information
reflecting
possible
espionage
activity
on
the
part
of
abel,
known
then
only
by
the
cryptonym,
mark,
was
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
immediately
conducted
an
intensive
investigation
of
abel
and
his
alleged
espionage
activities
and
the
results,
thereof,
were
furnished
to
the
internal
security
division.
he
then
goes
on
--
and
as
i
say,
explained
--
that
they
believe
that
they
didn't
have
enough
evidence
to
get
a
warrant,
to
get
an
indictment.
and
again,
as
i
say,
insofar
as
having
enough
evidence
to
obtain
a
warrant,
i
say
that
both
the
brinegar
case
and
the
draper
case
ran
to
any
of
such
concept
of
misconception.
and
then
i
point
out
to
your
honor
that
down
on
the
bottom
of
page
57,
this
is
very
well
summarized.
thus,
on
june
19th,
1957,
the
department
of
justice
had
information
that
a
soviet
national
was
in
the
united
states
illegally
and
was
heading
up
a
soviet
espionage
apparatus.
the
department
was
unable
to
proceed
under
the
espionage
statutes,
but
could
proceed
under
the
immigration
laws,
the
duty
and
obligation
to
do
so
seems
to
us
clear.
in
other
words,
your
honor,
it's
perfectly
evident
and
as
you'll
see
cited
in
our
brief
under
the
reorganization
act
a
few
years
ago,
both
of
these
services
are
just
components
within
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
but
regrettably,
the
courts
below
didn't
see
fit
to
--
to
carry
through
this.
and
the
result
was
that
your
honor
will
find
that
the
circuit
court
opinion
rationalizes
that
i.n.s.
have
performed
their
duty
and
f.b.i.
performed
their
duty
and,
of
course,
the
two
services
could
cooperate.
and
we,
of
course,
believe
that
--
that
this
is
a
grave
oversimplification
of
the
matter.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
your
honor
--
your
honor,
the
statements
that
i
have
just
read
i
believe
explain
when
this
matter
and
in
no
credit
detail
do
i
know
in
this
record.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no,
sir.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
certainly,
is
a
matter
of
law,
that's
true,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
time,
i
believe
i
can
trace
it
for
your
honor
in
this
fashion.
when
hayhanen
walked
into
the
american
embassy
in
paris,
he
turned
himself
over
to
a
representative
of
the
central
intelligence
agency,
which
would
have
no
internal
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states.
so
he,
accordingly,
would
transmit
this
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
which
does
have
such
jurisdiction.that
would
be
in
early
may.
i
would
assume
that
the
bureau
would
promptly
notify
the
internal
security
division
what,
as
your
honor
will
see,
it
was
only
very
much
later
that
they
called
in
the
immigration
service
and
informed
them.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
would
say
that
the
detail
to
the
--
to
the
extent
i
just
gave
you
did
come
out
at
the
hearing
and
is
pointed
out
by
the
record.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
as
your
honor
will
find
in
our
brief,
we
frankly
simply
reject
this
entire
theory
and
believe
that
it's
incredible.
and
what
--
what
we
bring
out
in
our
brief
is
that
i.n.s.
was
called
in
because
they
believe
they
had
technical
jurisdiction,
that
they
could
draw
on
administrative
warrant
returnable
to
themselves
and
that
they
could
endeavor
what
perspectively
we
certainly
concede,
would
be
in
the
country's
interest
to
endeavor
to
get
this
chief
of
russian
espionage
in
the
united
states
to
do
what
his
assistant
had
done.
he'd
been
living
in
the
united
states
for
nine
years.
now,
if
--
if
they
could
solicit
his
cooperation,
keep
the
entire
amount
of
secret,
it's
perfectly
evident
that
a
tremendous
coup
in
intelligence
work
could
be
accomplished.
at
a
very
minimum,
if
the
man
is
that
important,
at
a
very
--
very
minimum,
you
would
secure
a
complete
information
on
an
enemy
apparatus.
you
would
secure
the
names
of
all
the
various
people
in
the
security.
you'd
secure
keys
to
cyphers.
and
at
a
maximum,
if
--
if
the
fact
that
he
had
come
over
to
the
united
states
side
could
be
kept
secret,
at
a
maximum,
you
would
achieve
what
is
every
intelligence
chief's
dream,
the
creation
of
a
double
agent.
so
that
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
b.
donovan
oh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
b.
donovan
oh
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
just
coming
to
that
--
i
was
seeking
to
answer
justice
clark's
question.
but
that
in
short,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
--
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
overwhelmingly
shows
that
this
was
the
objective.
and
to
sum
up
what
actually
we
will
be
contending,
it
is
not
that
we
have
condemned
the
department
of
justice
for
what
was
done
or
the
f.b.i.,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
any
person
of
common
sense,
it
probably,
prospectively,
was
worth
the
gamble.
however,
what
we
say
is
that
you
cannot
do
what
was
done
in
this
case,
which
is
to
take
an
administrative
warrant
--
first,
by
the
way,
as
i'll
bring
out
in
a
moment,
without
warrant
try
to
get
his
cooperation.
then
when
that
failed,
then
have
the
f.b.i.
call
in
i.n.s.
officers
waiting
outside
the
hall,
have
them
serve
him
with
this
warrant,
grab
everything,
hustle
them
off
in
the
plane
to
a
remote
place
in
--
in
texas
and
hold
them
incommunicado
for
three
days.
now,
the
whole
point
of
my
argument
is
that
i'm
not
complaining
about
this.
this
isn't
a
case
in
which
i'm
making
some
passionate
plea
that
this
poor
man
was
deprived
of
civil
liberties
and
so
on.
the
whole
point
is
that
if,
under
any
kind
of
extraordinary
powers
that
these
people
may
possess,
if
they
could
do
that,
my
point
is
that
having
gone
down
that
road,
employed
such
a
process,
having
him
drop
out
of
sight
for
three
days,
then
for
six
weeks
holding
him
down
in
texas,
offering
him
a
job,
offering
him
every
other
inducement
to
come
over
our
side,
none
of
this
ever
contradicted
in
the
court
below.
i
say
that
having
taken
that
gamble
and
having
lost,
that
then
you
cannot
come
back
up
the
other
road
and
seek
to
get
an
indictment
and
pretend
the
due
process
of
laws
been
followed.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
it
will
be
my
contention
that
the
--
that
there
was
no
right
to
search.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well
--
and
your
honor,
our
answer
to
that
is
that
--
that
this
was
literally
a
search
and
seizure
by
subterfuge
and
i
believe
that
the
facts
will
bear
out
what
--
what
i'm
saying.
what
should
be
understood
is
this.
having
made
in
the
internal
security
division
the
determination
that
mr.
maroney's
affidavit
states,
then
the
f.b.i.
called
in
i.n.s.
and
reviewed
the
matter
with
them,
and
as
a
result
on
june
20th,
here
in
washington,
it
was
agreed
that
i.n.s.
should
execute
an
administrative
warrant
returnable
to
themselves,
as
you
know,
an
administrative
warrant
to
pick
up
the
man
in
new
york,
but
that
--
but
that
this
was
to
be
served
only
at
the
signal
of
the
f.b.i.
and
that
the
f.b.i.
was
to
get
the
first
opportunity
to
go
in
without
any
warrant
and
solicit
his
cooperation.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
he's
been
ordered
deport.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
is
precisely
right.
and
--
and,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
did
not
say
that.
what
i
said,
your
honor,
was
that
in
no
way
is
there
involved
in
this
case
at
any
of
our
contentions
because
it's
quite
irrelevant
to
the
case,
a
contesting
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
deportation
process.
what
we're
saying
is
that
you
cannot
use
the
deportation
process,
conduct
a
search
and
seizure,
and
as
justice
frankfurter
said,
"perhaps,
it's
perfectly
all
right
to
use
anything
seized
in
that
process."
but
what
we're
saying
is
you
cannot,
with
full
knowledge
and
--
and
with
full
opportunity
and
time,
to
have
followed
the
other
road,
you
cannot
use
this
process
search
and
seize,
make
no
public
return
before
any
public
official
and
then
use
what's
seized
as
the
basis
to
convict
a
man
of
a
capital
crime.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
have
found
no
decision
of
this
court,
nor
has
the
department
of
justice
cited
one
that
would
say
the
contrary.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
and
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
point
out
to
your
honor
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not,
but
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
the
question.
and
what
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
this,
justice
brennan.
let
us
not
think
that
in
talking
of
the
two
roads
that
i
have,
(1)
of
going
down
this
road
of
no
public
return,
keeping
it
entirely
secret,
using
administrative
warrant,
that
the
only
other
road,
the
road
of
due
process
was
to
indict
for
espionage.
it's
a
crime
to
illegally
enter
the
united
states.
and
the
record
shows
that
a
determination
had
been
made
in
the
immigration
division.
the
record
shows
this
not
to
institute
criminal
proceedings
at
that
time.
so
that
in
answer
to
your
question,
even
if
you
didn't
have
this
espionage
thing,
i
would
say
--
and
although
as
justice
frankfurter
points
out,
it's
not
necessary
to
my
argument
--
i
would
say
that
to
have
made
such
a
decision
that
they
wouldn't
institute
criminal
proceeding
and
then
to
seize
the
evidence
of
this
fashion
and
then
perhaps
commence
an
indictment
for
illegal
entry,
i
believe
that
the
same
valid
objection
do
exist.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
yes,
in
my
judgment.
however,
quite
apart
from
that,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
--
that
under
the
brinegar
case
and
under
the
draper
case,
there
would
be
no
need
to
disclose
the
name
of
--
of
this
particular
informant
at
all.
and
may
i
also
point
out
that
mr.
maroney's
affidavit
on
page
57
of
the
record
makes
perfectly
clear
that
they
weren't
seeking
to
keep
this
testimony
secret.
what
they
were
seeking
was
to
try
to
persuade
him
to
make
it
public,
but
he
said,
he
would
refuse
to
take
the
stand
and
he
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
if
he
were
called.
and
this
is
stated
by
mr.
maroney,
so
it
is
not
and
in
any
way
that
they
were
seeking
not
to
go
forward
at
that
time,
according
to
this
affidavit,
but
rather
that
they
didn't
think
they
had
enough
to
get
an
--
a
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
say,
your
honor,
that
under
all
the
facts
of
--
of
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i'm
taking
--
i'm
taking
to
your
case,
your
honor,
excluding
the
f.b.i.,
but
i
am
also
taking
what
happened
in
this
case
in
the
light
of
your
decision
in
the
kremen
case.
and
i
say
that
--
that
be
graved
out
in
my
judgment
as
to
whether
where
the
choice
--
i'm
assuming
on
your
honors
facts
that
they
did
have
probable
cause,
enough
to
have
gotten
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
for
the
illegal
entry
to
the
united
states.
but
they
deliberately
held
back
on
that,
instead
went
in,
used
an
administrative
warrant,
got
--
made
a
general
search,
got
to
all
of
this,
rushed
them
off
as
they
did
down
to
texas,
had
him
dropped
out
of
sight
and
then
turn
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
think
it
does
very
materially,
your
honor,
because
it
--
it
renders
--
it
renders
clear
what
happened
here
and
renders
clear
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
administrative
warrant
was
being
used
to
accomplish
what
we
call
search
and
seizure
by
subterfuge.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
your
honor,
if
i
could
get
to
exactly
what
did
happen
the
day
of
june
21st,
i
think
that
perhaps
this
will
become
--
become
clearer.
now,
having
made
this
decision
in
washington
on
june
20th,
early
the
morning
of
june
21st,
the
i.n.s.
men
had
slept
overnight
at
the
f.b.i.
headquarters
in
new
york.
they
proceeded
down
with
the
f.b.i.
men
to
the
hotel
latham
and
meanwhile,
a
--
a
warrant
of
--
of
arrest
so-called,
and
in
order
to
show
cause
for
deportation
had
been
issued
by
i.n.s.
they
then
enter
the
hotel
latham.
the
f.b.i.
already
was
occupying
the
room
next
to
abel.
it
had
been
previously
agreed
and
there
is
no
contradiction
of
this
in
the
evidence
that
i.n.s.
was
to
--
to
serve
its
--
its
warrant
only
when
beckoned
to
do
so
by
the
f.b.i.
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
to
the
fact
that
the
i.n.s.
officers
say,
“well,
we
were
just
there
to
do
--
to
do
our
duty
and
to
--
we
didn't
render
any
--
to
make
anything
contention.”
but
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
they
had
agreed
rather
to
what
actually
happened.
now,
what
happened
was
at
7
o'clock
in
the
morning,
they
knocked
on
abel's
door,
the
f.b.i.
the
i.n.s.
officers
were
kept
outside
of
the
door.
when
abel
opened
the
door,
they
pushed
their
way
in.
three
f.b.i.
men
came
in,
identified
themselves
and
then
proceeded
to
attempt
to
interrogate
him
about
espionage.
now,
all
of
this
is
brought
out,
incidentally.
all
the
evidence
that
we're
discussing
was
furnished
by
government
witnesses
or
was
undisputed
in
the
court
below.
agent
blasco
who
testified
at
the
hearing
below
testified
that
after
identifying
themselves,
they
explained
to
abel
the
internal
security
functions
of
the
f.b.i.
they
said,
"colonel,
we
have
information
connecting
you
with
espionage
in
the
united
states."
and
your
honors
will
find,
he
said
this
several
times,
“we
said
to
him
several
times,
‘unless,
colonel,
you
cooperate
with
us,
you
will
be
arrested
before
you
leave
this
room."
now,
to
--
in
response
to
this
questioning,
now
understand
--
understand
the
f.b.i.
had
no
warrant
of
any
type
whatsoever.
now,
having
spent
a
half
an
hour
of
this
--
on
things
of
this
kind
and
getting
absolutely
nowhere,
they
gave
up,
opened
the
door,
beckoned
to
the
i.n.s.
officers
who
then
proceeded
to
come
in
and
to
serve
the
--
this
administrative
warrant
in
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor
--
your
honor,
having
--
having
done
this,
they
proceeded
to
make
a
general
search
of
the
room.
as
in
the
kremen
case,
it
was
a
superficial
search
there,
but
a
complete
seizure.
they
took
it
over
to
i.n.s.
headquarters.
he
was
fingerprinted
and
then
rushed
out
the
same
day
over
to
newark
airport
where
a
special
plane
was
waiting
with
two
armed
guards.
he's
put
in
a
special
plane
and
is
taken
off
to
this
remote
detention
center
down
in
mcallen,
texas.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
think
the
draper
case
would
so
hold,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
my
--
my
main
point
of
course
here
is
that
in
the
event
that
they
followed
normal
due
process,
they
had
to
make
an
immediate
public
return.
he
had
to
be
brought
before
a
district
court
or
united
states
commissioner.he
had
to
be
immediately
given
counsel.
he
had
to
be
remanded
the
custody
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
and
all
of
those
things
would
have
occurred.
this
way,
literally,
a
man
disappeared
off
the
face
of
the
earth
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
three
days.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
every
indication
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
every
indication,
your
honor,
is
that
the
process
employed
was
sought
to
keep
the
things
safer.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
wouldn't
know,
your
honor.
i
would
know,
however,
that
they
would
immediately
have
to
have
taken
him
over
publicly
before
a
united
states
district
judge
or
a
commissioner
and
he
would
have
the
right
to
counsel
and
so
on.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
under
the
kremen
case,
your
honor,
i
would
have
great
doubt.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
i
was
answering
a
specific
question,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
perhaps
it'd
be
simple
for
me
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
has
ever
passed
on
this
point.
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
this
has
ever
arisen
before.
if
i
could
direct,
your
honors'
attention
though
to
page
33
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
b.
donovan
not
always,
your
honor.
if
--
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
page
33,
your
honor
will
find
that
in
many
cases
the
--
the
man
would
--
would
be
permitted
to
stay
home.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
it's
--
however
--
however,
your
honor,
perhaps
we
at
least
could
agree
that
it's
unusual
to
--
to
hustle
a
man
out
the
back
door
of
a
hotel,
put
him
in
a
waiting
car
and
take
him
over
in
handcuffs
with
armed
guards
to
fingerprint
him
and
then
take
him
over
to
a
especially
waiting
plane
at
newark
airport
where
he's
the
only
passenger
with
two
armed
guards.
he
isn't
told
where
he's
going
and
thirteen
hours
later,
he
winds
up
at
mcallen,
texas.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
it
does,
your
honor.
it
does.
and
this
is
of
course
a
unique
case.
on
page
33
on
the
transcript,
from
33
to
37,
you
will
find
what
purport
to
be
the
documents
on
which
the
legality
of
these
unusual
procedures
may
rests.
now,
i
just
like
to
point
out
very
quickly
a
few
things
about
these.
the
--
in
the
first
place
in
page
33,
both
of
these
papers
were
served
on
abel
when
they
seized
him.
it's
--
the
first
one
is
called
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
an
alien
and
there's
a
statute
authorizing
this.
briefly,
it
lacks
every
characteristic
traditionally
associated
with
an
arrest.
arrest
traditionally
is
a
judicial
process.
it's
a
writ
returnable
before
a
public
--
public
officer
in
a
judicial
capacity.
this
is
literally
an
executive
--
the
executive
warrant.
he
--
you
--
your
honors
will
note
that
there's
no
provision
for
return
before
a
judicial
officer,
number
one.
number
two,
there's
no
statement
that
he
has
the
right
to
immediate
counsel.
in
fact,
in
our
reply
brief,
we
showed
that
under
i.n.s.
regulations,
the
only
provision
for
counsel
is
that
the
deportation
hearing.
number
three,
this
contains
no
direction
or
authorization
to
search
or
seize.
number
four,
and
perhaps
most
important,
your
honors
will
note,
there's
no
requirement
that
this
be
issued
even
based
on
any
one's
affidavit.
there's
no
sworn
statement
connected
with
the
entire
thing.
all
of
these
things,
we
say,
completely
are
lacking.
next,
on
the
next
page,
the
order
to
show
cause
and
notice
of
hearing,
your
honors
will
--
will
notice
that
here,
we're
talking
about
a
writ.
it
appearing
no
statement
as
to
what
it
was
issued
on.
there's
no
requirement
of
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
one
of
these.
there's
no
requirement
that
any
--
any
person
have
submitted
an
affidavit
in
support
of
this.
the
warrant
is
then
returnable
to
the
man
himself.
could
i
also
point
out
on
page
35
in
--
as
part
of
these
unusual
documents,
he--
the
man
is
ordered
to
appear
at
a
hearing
of
i.n.s.
for
deportation
and
understand
these
documents
are
expressly
limited
to
deportation
procedures,
which
this
court
have
frequently
helped
to
take
of
a
civil
process
and
the
men
are
entitled
to
jury
trial,
the
very
sort
of
thing.
but,
the
point
is,
here,
to
show
--
to
bring
out
the
interrelationship
that
i
was
speaking
of
with
mr.
justice
harlan
before.
the
man
is
being
notified
that
he's
to
have
a
hearing
at
70
columbus
avenue
new
york,
new
york
on
july
1,
1957.
at
the
very
time
the
man
was
served
with
this
on
june
21st,
the
plane
was
warming
up
out
in
newark
to
take
him
down
to
mcallen,
texas
where
he
was
incommunicado
for
three
days
and
where,
for
six
weeks,
both
f.b.i.
and
i.n.s.
agents
interrogated
him,
offered
him
cooperation
if
he
would
--
if
he
would
cooperate
and
so
on.
now
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
he
did,
your
honor.
at
the
end
of
three
days,
he
--
he
--
well,
he
decided
to
state
that
his
name
was
rudolf
ivanovich
abel,
that
he
was
a
russian
citizen;
that
he
desired
to
be
deported
to
russia.
having
made
that
statement,
he
was
allowed
counsel,
called
up
and
obtained
counsel
from
a
telephone
directory
down
there.
counsel
came
over
and
on
june
20
--
20th,
he
was
given
a
hearing
at
which
he
was
the
only
witness
and
was
ordered
deported
to
russia.
now,
while
he
was
given
that
hearing
on
june
27th
down
in
texas,
on
june
28th,
up
in
brooklyn,
they
were
proceeding
to
go
forward
with
preparations
for
a
criminal
prosecution
because
they
were
obtaining
the
search
warrant
and
so
on.
now,
with
respect
to
--
to
this
case,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
even
if
through
some
extraordinary
power
that
i'm
not
familiar
with,
the
f.b.i.
or
department
of
justice
can
take
people
that
they
think
are
spies
and
do
these
things
with
them,
i'm
saying
even
if
they
had
that,
you
can't
--
after
going
down
that
road
and
losing,
you
can't
come
back
and
indict
the
man
and
pretend
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
clear
in
the
past
that
every
one
of
these
cases
should
stand
on
every
pertinent
fact.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
under
the
harris
case,
every
fact
which
i
have
mentioned
is
exceedingly
important
in
determining
what
was
the
objective
of
the
department
of
justice
in
doing
these
extraordinary
things.
were
they
interested
in
just
picking
up
an
alien
and
deporting
him
or
were
they
interested
in
trying
to
pick
up
the
chief
of
russian
espionage
in
the
united
states,
trying
to
get
him
to
cooperate
with
us
and
if
it
fails
to
prosecute
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
obviously,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
it's
highly
illegal,
but
among
the
reasons
why
are
all
of
these
facts.
and
under
the
harris
case,
i
believe
that
all
of
these
facts
are
--
are
pertinent.
now,
may
i
say
that
this
isn't
a
case
in
which
there
are
just
--
a
few
items
were
seized
that
were
introduced.
in
exhibit
c
to
our
brief,
your
honor,
we'll
find
over
40
such
items.
and
furthermore,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
we're
arguing
on
specific
decisions
that
under
the
harris
case
with
an
overtone
of
the
rabinowitz
decision
and
so
on
that
such
and
such
was
proper
or
illegal.
this,
we
say,
is
a
classic
case
of
proceedings
directly
contrary
to
the
expressed
text
of
the
fourth
amendment
designed
to
prevent
writs
of
assistance
at
similar
process
of
this
nature.
thank
you.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
may
it
please
the
court.
although
i
reserved
time
for
a
reply,
i'll
make
no
detailed
reply.
i
believe
that
most
of
the
arguments
that
i'd
set
forth
are
contained
in
my
reply
brief,
which
i
commend
to
your
earnest
asserting.
however,
i
should
like
to
--
to
make
a
--
a
few
observations
with
respect
to
some
of
these
matters
that
have
been
brought
out
this
morning
on
questioning
by
the
court.
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
discussion
of
seven
items
can
be
very
misleading.
if
i
could
direct
your
attention
to
page
41
of
our
brief,
appendix
c,
your
honor
will
find
that
there
are
over
40
items
involved
here
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
either
--
either,
your
honor,
as
you
will
see,
that
all
of
these
items
were
used
by
the
department
of
justice
in
the
case
and
they
were
either
seized
in
latham
or
else
obtained
in
the
studio
on
a
search
warrant,
which
was
obtained
solely
by
residing
everything
found
at
the
latham.
so
that
all
of
these
items,
we
believe
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
are
involved
in
this
case.
that's
point
number
one.
our
point
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
these
are
all
set
forth,
your
honor,
in
appendix
c.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
those
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor,
as
exhibits
and
we've
--
we've
listed
here
not
only
--
not
only
on
page
41,
not
only
identification
of
the
record
where
it
was
offered
but
also
where
received.
now,
second
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
now,
secondly
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
--
your
honor,
to
clarify
for
the
court,
we
have
divided
them
into
four
different
categories.
item
c
is
to
the
latham
which
were
introduced
as
exhibits.
item
c
is
to
the
latham
which
were
used
to
obtain
the
exhibits
introduced.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
your
honor,
these
are
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
do
they
take
from
the
room,
your
honor,
they
cleaned
out
the
room.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
by
i.n.s.
they
cleaned
out
the
room
of
everything
--
everything
that
was
in
there,
except
these
items
which
the
government
say
he
voluntarily
abandoned
while,
believing
he
was
under
arrest
and
surrounded
by
armed
guards
and
so
on,
but
he
voluntarily
abandoned
these
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
it's
perfectly
obvious
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
that
someone
may
--
of
course,
someone
may
be
helping
me
pack
but
if
he
has
a
gun
on
me
at
the
same
time,
which
is
not
a
way
to
describe
what
he's
doing
to
say
he's
helping
me
pack.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
your
honor,
he
was
naked
when
he
was
seized.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
with
respect
to
justice
frankfurter's
question
about
the
harris
case,
the
point
involved
here
is
far
more
fundamental
than
relying
on
the
harris
case.
i've
used
the
harris
case,
the
terminology
used
and
it's
simply
because
that
the
decision
of
the
court
is
applicable.
the
point
here
is
far
more
fundamental.
no
matter
how
we
try
to
get
around
it,
by
any
kind
of
elaborate
argument,
the
fact
remains
that
a
man
was
made
to
disappear
in
the
united
states
for
three
days
with
all
its
effects
based
on
an
administrative
process,
which
is
returnable
to
no
one
except
the
man
who
issues
it,
makes
no
provisions
for
counsel,
makes
no
provision
for
search
or
seizure
and
the
man
is
hold
off
to
a
distant
place
and
on
this
evidence
is
convicted
of
a
capital
crime.
now,
i
see
that
in
our
time,
the
only
place
that
criminal
procedures
have
been
based
on
such
a
process
have
been
in
the
police
states
of
nazi
germany,
soviet
russia
on
their
satellites
never
in
this
country.
now,
finally,
throughout
this
case,
there's
been
elaborate
discussion
of
the
national
defense
and
how
that's
so
important
with
respect
to
this
man's
conviction.
but
i
wonder
if
this
isn't
a
very
unwise
oversimplification
of
this
matter.
the
fact
is
that
--
that
if
we
look
perhaps
20
years,
i
suggest
to
the
court,
25
years,
when
god
willing,
the
russian
people
are
really
free,
perhaps
aligned
with
us
against
great
china
as
a
common
foe.
looking
back
with
a
benefit
of
hindsight,
what
will
we
see
as
having
been
the
most
important
weapon
in
--
on
national
defense?
i
think
we
will
see
what
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
how
important
it
was
to
keep
military
preparedness,
how
important
it
was
to
use
the
f.b.i.
and
other
internal
security
agents
to
prevent
suppression
at
home.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
will
be
found
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
that
the
most
potent
weapon
in
our
arsenal
defense
turns
out
to
be
our
way
of
life.
best
epitomized
perhaps
in
that
simple
phrase
due
process
of
law
and
it
is
that
maintenance
of
that
way
of
life,
the
maintenance
of
due
process
of
law
held
before
the
other
peoples
in
the
world
that
i
suggest
to
you
in
an
age
of
intercontinental
missiles
with
hydrogen
warheads
will
turn
out
to
have
been
a
strongest
weapon
of
defense.
i
close
my
argument
the
same
words
with
which
i
closed
my
affidavit
in
the
district
court
in
commencing
a
proceeding
to
suppress
this
evidence,
and
i
quote
“able
is
an
alien
charged
with
the
capital
offense
of
soviet
espionage.
it
may
seem
anomalous
that
our
constitutional
guarantees
protect
such
a
man.
the
0(inaudible)
may
view
america's
conscientious
adherence
to
the
principles
of
a
free
society
as
altruism
so
scrupulous,
that
self-destruction
must
result.
yet
our
principles
are
engraved
in
the
history,
in
the
law
of
this
land.
if
the
free
world
is
not
faithful
to
its
own
moral
code,
there
remains
no
society
for
which
others
may
hunger.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
know
of
none.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
reargument.
it
was
argued
in
february
this
year.
in
march
the
court
ordered
reargument
on
specific
constitutional
issues
concerning
our
contention
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
pertaining
to
search
and
seizure.
it
will
be
my
plan
on
reargument
to
briefly
review
the
facts
once
again
for
the
court
and
then
advance
to
my
contention
that
this
case
involves
issues
of
great
importance
to
united
states,
not
only
with
respect
to
important
phases
of
its
national
security,
but
also
with
respect
to
what
i
shall
contend
of
violations
of
fundamental
rights
and
liberties
that
affect
every
person
living
in
the
united
states.
to
briefly
review
the
facts,
this
case
began
in
may
of
1957,
when
the
man
named
reino
hayhanen
appeared
in
the
american
embassy
in
paris
and
stated
to
the
local
representative
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
attached
to
that
embassy
that
for
several
years,
he
had
been
engaged
in
espionage
in
the
united
states,
where
he
operated
under
a
man
known
to
him
only
as
“mark”.
he
described
the
man
with
some
particularity.
he
produced
indeed
a
hollowed
out
coin
which
was
recognized
by
the
local
attaché
as
a
type
that
could
be
used
in
the
transmittal
of
espionage
materials.
he
was
brought
back
to
the
united
states
and
turned
over
to
the
f.b.i.,
who
then
proceeded
to
go
to
his
home
in
peekskill,
new
york,
where
a
great
many
other
objects
which
would
tend
to
sustain
his
story,
were
uncovered.
now,
meanwhile,
he,
having
identified
not
only
mark,
but
also
the
--
the
place
in
which
he
was
maintaining
an
artist's
studio
on
fulton
street
in
brooklyn,
the
f.b.i.
commenced
a
complete
surveillance
of
this
individual
not
only
where
he
operated
the
artist's
studio
in
brooklyn,
but
also
where
he
lived
in
the
hotel
latham
in
manhattan,
across
the
river.
on
june
20th,
1957,
the
f.b.i.
having
previously
alerted
immigration
and
naturalization,
both
being
component
parts
of
the
department
of
justice,
to
the
existence
of
the
suspected
espionage
agent,
on
june
20th,
conferred
in
washington
with
immigration
and
naturalization
and
requested
immigration
and
naturalization
to
apprehend
the
man
on
an
administrative
warrant
normally
used
by
immigration
and
naturalization
to
apprehend
the
person
with
deportation.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
a
memorandum
was
submitted,
your
honor,
to
immigration
and
naturalization,
which
on
the
one
hand
identified
the
man
as
an
alien,
living
illegally
in
the
united
states.
but
as
your
honor
will
find,
this
memorandum
originally
came
up
under
seal
to
this
court.
it
since
has
been
declassified,
has
been
made
available
to
the
court.
and
as
your
honor
will
find,
the
great
bulk
of
the
memorandum
deals
with
the
man
as
a
suspected
espionage
agent.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
now,
at
this
meeting
in
washington,
it
was
agreed
then
that
this
procedure
should
be
followed
and
that
evening
of
june
20th,
men
from
immigration
and
naturalization
and
from
the
f.b.i.
went
to
new
york
where
they
took
a
prepared
warrant
for
his
apprehension
to
the
acting
district
director
of
immigration,
who
proceeded
to
execute
that
warrant.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
officers
then
spent
the
night
at
f.b.i.
headquarters
in
new
york.
and
the
following
morning,
in
accordance
with
a
prearranged
plan,
proceeded
to
the
hotel
latham.
also
in
accordance
with
a
prearranged
plan,
instead
of
immigration
and
naturalization
participating
in
the
first
discussions
with
the
suspect,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
officers
remained
outside
in
the
hall
and
also
in
a
room
next
door
to
the
suspect
which
was
occupied
by
the
f.b.i.
and
in
accordance
with
prearrangement,
the
f.b.i.
agents
knocked
on
the
door.
it
was
7
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
june
21st.
when
a
man
opened
the
door
in
response
to
the
knock,
two
agents
of
the
f.b.i.
pushed
their
way
in
and
proceeded
to
identify
themselves
to
the
suspect.
after
identifying
themselves
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
words
that
i
used,
your
honor,
that
they
pushed
their
way
into
the
room,
a
direct
quote
from
the
f.b.i.
agent's
testimony
in
the
hearing
below.
the
extent
of
the
--
of
the
forcible
entry
is
neither
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
need
for
that.
he
had
opened
the
door
in
response
to
the
knock.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes.
i
believe
there
was
testimony
that
he
slightly
opened
the
door
and
said,
“who's
there?”
and
they
pushed
their
way
in
and
they
then
produced
their
credentials
and
explained
that
they
were
agents
of
the
f.b.i.,
all
incidentally,
what
i'm
telling
is
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
undisputed
facts,
developed
from
the
government
witnesses.
they
proceeded
not
only
to
identify
themselves
as
agents
of
the
f.b.i.,
but
as
they
explained,
their
first
act
was
to
explain
to
the
suspect
whom
they
addressed
as
colonel,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
f.b.i.
with
respect
to
internal
security
matters.
they
further
more
said
to
him,
"colonel,
we
have
information
leading
us
to
believe
that
you
had
been
involved
in
espionage."
they
said,
"unless
you
will
cooperate"
and
this
is
an
important
phrase
in
this
context,
"unless
you
will
cooperate
with
us
and
tell
us
what
we
ask
you,
unless
you
do
that,
you
will
be
put
under
arrest
before
you
leave
this
room."
abel
refused
in
effect
to
say
anything.
he
stated
that
his
name
was
emil
goldfus,
at
one
point.
another
point,
he
stated
that
he
was
registered
in
the
hotel
under
the
other
name
of
collins.
he
made
some
references
to
having
then
born
in
the
united
states
and
having
principally
lived
in
new
york,
but
he
refused
to
discuss
anything
else.
now,
after
a
half
hour
had
been
devoted
by,
now,
three
f.b.i.
agents,
where
a
third
have
subsequently
entered
the
room,
after
a
half
hour
of
a
fruitless
endeavor
to
persuade
him
to
cooperate,
the
f.b.i.
agents
went
to
the
door,
signaled
to
the
waiting
immigration
officers,
who
then
entered
the
room
and
proceeded
to
serve
abel
with
the
two
warrants,
which
have
been
discussed
at
great
length
before
the
court.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
he
answered
it.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
virtually
one
book
law
in
law
enforcement
that
before
a
man
can
be
confronted
and
questioned,
he
is
to
be
put
under
arrest.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
it
is
--
it
is,
your
honor,
a
established
law
that
before
a
man
can
be
subjected
to
questioning
in
this
manner
and
apprehend,
if
we
want
to
call
it
that,
two
armed
men,
wake
you
up
at
7
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
push
their
way
in
into
the
room,
display
credentials,
proceed
to
question
you
for
a
half
hour.
i'm
saying
that
there
is
case
law
to
be
effect
that
that
cannot
be
done
until
a
person
has
been
legally
put
under
arrest.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
sir.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
believe
that
you
will
find,
your
honor,
that
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
that
we've
raised
every
conceivable
argument
that
can
be
raised
with
respect
the
entire
set
circumstances
that
we're
talking
about.
now,
could
i
for
a
moment,
divert
from
my
narrative
to
deal
with
this
question.
in
the
last
two
briefs
that
the
government
submitted,
i
find
that
they
have
contended
that
some
of
these
issues
that
are
now
before
this
court,
where
never
raised
for
consideration
in
the
united
states
district
court.
well,
i've
stated
in
my
brief
that
these
contentions
rather
belated
by
the
government
are
probably
attributable
to
a
reluctance
to
face
these
issues.
however,
first
of
all,
you
will
find
that
in
the
government's
brief
why
--
what
is
almost
a
play
on
language
they
have
taken
out,
i
believe
out
of
context,
some
statements
that
were
made
in
colloquy
in
the
district
court.
those
statements,
your
honor,
will
find
deal
with
our
responses
to
such
questions
as,
"do
you
contend
that
immigration
and
naturalization
had
no
valid
right
to
apprehend
this
man
for
deportation?”
our
answer
is,
and
it
still
is,
no.
i
have
never
contented
that
this
warrants
are
invalid
for
oral
purposes.
there's
no
reason
i
should,
i
don't
have
a
deportation
case,
i
have
a
case
where
a
man
was
indicted,
tried
and
convicted
of
a
capital
crime
on
this
process.
and
there's
no
reason
why
i
have
to
go
beyond.
what
i'm
arguing,
my
defendant
did
not
receive
due
process
of
law.
these
questions
about
whether
or
not
they
could
be
valid
with
respect
to
deportation
are
hypothetical
questions
that
aren't
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
if
your
honor
would
like
that,
i
will
assume
it
arguendo.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
conceded
--
he's
accepted
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i'm
explaining,
your
honor,
i've
never
even
researched
the
point.
the
government
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
that
is
not
the
gravamen
of
my
province.
now
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
now,
these
until
recently,
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
my
original
affidavit
put
in,
in
united
states
district
court
and
which
is
printed
in
the
record
before
this
court,
made
so
clear
these
fundamental
contentions
that
i'm
making
that
it
would
be
perfectly
evident
that
there
is
no
ground
to
say
that
some
new
issue
is
being
raised
before
this
court.
however,
in
the
last
brief
of
the
government,
you
will
find
at
least
a
half
dozen
references
to
these
new
contentions
and
these
new
issues.
now,
it
maybe
that
the
government
never
fully
understood
my
contentions,
but
so
far
as
saying
that
they
weren't
advanced
in
the
district
court,
this
is
simply
nonsense.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
this
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
this
--
this,
your
honor,
would
be
highly
compartmentalized
thinking.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
furthermore,
may
i
point
out
that
if
you
go
down
that
road
and
you
try
to
examine
each
one
of
these
propositions
in
its
own
little
compartment,
the
rule
of
law
laid
down
by
this
court
to
govern
the
procedure
in
future
cases
of
suspected
alien
espionage
agents,
obviously
will
permit
the
end
of
any
criminal
warrants
being
obtained.
obviously,
these
warrants
are
very
handy
little
instruments.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
if
--
and
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
they
certainly
are
involved,
your
honor.
but,
while
i
have
said
to
justice
harlan
that
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
assume
arguendo,
the
legality
and
validity
of
those
warrants
with
respect
to
deportation,
i
again
want
to
emphasize
that
i
have
not
researched
this
question
and
indeed
in
my
judgment,
in
certain
cases
of
deportation,
i
would
think
that
lacking
fundamental
procedural
safeguard
for
the
lacking
and
the
present
form
of
these
warrants
that
there
could
be
great
question
as
to
their
constitutionality
even
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
but
isn't
my
case.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
now,
in
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
administrative
warrant,
your
honor,
is
valid
in
the
sense
that
it
can
conforms
to
the
statutes.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
warrant
complies
with
the
statute,
but
i'm
explaining,
if
instead
of
being
assigned
to
an
espionage
case
that
put
aside
to
a
deportation
case,
i
might
have
made
other
arguments
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
not
before
me,
it's
a
hypothetical
question.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
insofar
--
again
say
as
this
case
is
concerned,
i
claim
the
entire
process
is
invalid
with
respect
to
how
it
would
come
up
under
rather
circumstances
in
a
deportation
case,
where
they
did
deport
the
man,
as
i
say
that
--
that's
a
separate
question.
but
i
agree
with
you
that
my
argument
does
not
necessarily
rest
on
this
invalidity.
now,
with
the
court
in
of
course
reviewing
my
case,
concludes
that
these
warrants
are
invalid
for
all
purposes.
that's
within
the
province
of
the
court.
but
such
a
contention
is
not
essential
to
my
case
and
my
judgment.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
it's
a
matter
of
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
it
would
be
absurd
to
do
so,
your
honor.
it's
like
writing
a
series
of
seven
different
law
review
articles,
each
dealing
with
it.
you
take
the
government's
brief,
the
latest
government
brief
and
you
will
find
that
they
talked
about
the
arrest
over
here
as
though
it
were
a
separate
subject
and
the
search
and
seizure
over
here
as
an
entirely
separate
matter,
this
is
absurd.
the
search
and
seizure
i'm
complaining
about
is
not
with
respect
to
the
how
it
--
perhaps
a
short
wave
radio,
i'm
talking
about
the
seizure
and
search
of
a
human
thing.
a
man
who
was
held
incommunicado
for
at
least
the
government
can
say
three
days.
the
search
and
seizure
and
the
arrest
whatever
we
wish
to
quote,
they're
all
part
and
parcel
or
inextricably
entwined.
the
part
of
process
used
in
this
case.
now,
because
in
the
government's
last
brief,
there
are
a
half
dozen
references
to
these
new
issues
that
have
come
up
before
the
court
that
the
fourth
district
judge
never
had
a
chance
to
consider
and
which
might
have
bravely
all
to
mistakenly
suggest,
this
showed
such
as
a
monumental
lapse
of
memory
on
the
part
of
department
of
justice
that
it
began
to
give
me
some
concern
for
my
own.
so,
accordingly,
notwithstanding
the
presence
in
the
record
of
my
affidavit,
last
friday,
i
went
over
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
and
dug
out
of
their
files
and
borrowed
from
them,
a
copy
of
the
first
memorandum
of
law,
which
i
submitted
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
when
i
brought
this
action
to
compel
the
suppression
of
this
property
as
evidence,
i
not
only
supported
it
with
that
affidavit
which
is
printed
in
the
record,
but
i
supported
it
with
a
memorandum
of
law.
now,
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
the
last
couple
of
paragraphs
of
this
memorandum
of
law.
and
i
do
this
not
only
because
it
will
show
the
court
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
government's
contentions
that
these
are
new
issues,
but
also
because
it
happens
to
be
as
able
a
summary
of
my
entire
case
today
as
i
possibly
could
make.
this
is
page
15
of
the
original
memorandum
of
law,
“from
the
foregoing,
it
is
clear
that
an
immigration
warrant
issued
by
agents
of
the
department
of
justice,
is
not
a
warrant
charging
the
alien
with
the
commission
of
a
crime.
therefore,
it
cannot
be
the
basis
of
the
lawful
search
and
seizure,”

against
richardson,

gray
454,
cited
with
approval
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
boyd
against
the
united
states,
supra.
an
executive
procedure
such
as
that
employed
to
obtain
an
immigration
warrant
in
which
the
attorney
general
is
accountable
only
to
himself
without
any
of
the
safeguards
discussed
above,
cannot
and
should
not
be
the
basis
for
a
lawful
search
and
seizure
to
procure
evidence
for
use
in
the
prosecution
of
a
capital
crime.
petitioner's
property
in
room
839
of
the
hotel
latham
was
search
and
seized
on
june
21,
1957,
without
legal
warrant.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
rule
41
(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
are
clear
in
providing
that
such
property
must
be
returned
and
suppressed
for
use
as
evidence
in
any
criminal
proceeding
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
now,
with
respect
to
matters
of
this
sort
first
of
all,
to
be
practical
about
it,
it
is
very
difficult
in
the
course
of
the
heat
of
the
trial
of
this
magnitude
to
make
every
legal
contention
the
trial
counsel
makes,
with
all
the
learning
and
the
accuracy
that
he
might
--
the
following
--
some
are
spend
in
an
article
for
the
harvard
law
review,
that's
axiomatic.
and
secondly
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
secondly,
it's
been
my
experience
that
counsel
on
any
given
point,
becomes
a
little
more
articulate
on
it
the
longer
he
lives
with
it.
however,
in
all
planners
not
withstanding
those,
what
i'm
saying
is
based
on
the
original
memorandum
of
law,
the
only
embarrassment
that
i
find
in
this
entire
matter,
is
that,
it's
quite
evident
that
i
haven't
had
a
new
thought
on
this
subject
in
the
past
two
years.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
simplest
way
to
state
my
position
is
that
insofar
as
anyone
of
these
procedures
is
pertinent
to
my
case
which
is
the
conviction
of
the
man
for
the
capital
crime
of
espionage,
i
challenge
it
insofar
as
it's
not
pertinent
to
my
case
and
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
beyond
it,
i'm
assuming,
i'm
arguendo.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
ordinarily
--
ordinarily,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
of
the
rules
of
this
court
indeed,
that
the
court
doesn't
pass
on
hypothetical
questions
and
i
have
simply
studied
this
and
challenged
it
and
did
in
the
district
court,
as
i
believe
this
memorandum
showed
there's
no
change
from
my
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
i
do
--
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that
to
the
extent
that
--
that
it
was
in
this
case
--
i
challenged
it
on
every
one
of
those
grounds.
now,
i've
pointed
out
to
justice
harlan
and
indeed,
have
pointed
out
not
only
in
my
oral
argument
the
last
time,
but
you
will
find
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
that
i
pointed
out
with
respect
to
this
warrant
itself
that
it
--
it
is
quite
totally
lacking
in
normal
procedural
safeguards.
i
pointed
that
out.
i
furthermore,
pointed
out
that
there's
a
legislative
history
to
these
warrants
and
that
i
gave
citations
to
how
at
one
point
in
the
past,
procedural
safeguards
were
created
with
respect
to
these
warrants,
but
then,
that
that
was
removed.
so,
that
all
--
all
of
these
arguments,
your
honor,
i
did
make.
the
only
thing
i
do
again
come
back
to
is
that
if
the
court
finds
that
i
have
not
treated
the
deportation
phase
of
this
in
the
sanctity
that
i
have
everything
else,
it
is
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
have
never
felt
i
was
handling
a
deportation
case.
the
man
was
not
deported.
the
man
instead
was
indicted,
tried
and
convicted
of
a
capital
crime.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes.
i
did
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
did,
i
did,
your
honor,
but
could
i
point
out
that
--
that
my
first
question
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
far
broad
and
more
fundamental.
the
first
question
is,
whether
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
stated
are
violated
by
a
search
and
the
seizure
of
evidence
without
a
search
warrant.
after
an
alien
suspected
and
officially
accused
of
espionage
was
been
taken
into
custody
for
deportation
pursuant
to
an
administrative
immigration
service
warrant,
but
is
not
been
arrested
for
the
commission
of
a
crime.
and
this
court
granted
me
certiorari
with
respect
to
that
first
basic
question.
this
second
question,
your
honor,
is
related,
but
is
separable.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
if
you
can
win
this
case
for
me
[laughter]
i
hope
it
was
more
than
appreciative.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
[laughs]
now,
at
the
same
time
that
this
man
was
served
with
these
warrants
in
room
839
of
the
latham,
at
7:30,
the
morning
of
june
21st,
he
then
had
all
his
effects
in
his
room
seats
this
by
immigration
and
naturalization,
but
in
the
presence
of
the
f.b.i.
officers.
they
then
took
abel
and
his
effects
to
immigration
headquarters
where
he's
fingerprinted.
and
then
that
afternoon
was
taken
to
north
airport,
placed
in
a
special
plane
with
two
immigration
and
naturalization
agents
and
flown
down
to
mcallen,
texas,
where
for
three
days,
he
was
questioned
repeatedly,
continually
by
agents
of
the
f.b.i.
and
immigration
officials.
two
of
the
men
who
had
been
in
on
the
original
seizure
of
abel
in
the
hotel
room
were
flown
immediately
down
to
texas
and
participated
in
what
transpired.
now,
i
won't
go
into
what
has
never
really
been
contradicted
by
the
government
and
which
abel
has
sworn
to
in
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
he
was
offered
every
kind
of
inducement
to
cooperate
and
come
over
with
the
united
states
including
the
offer
of
the
position
in
the
federal
government.
but,
suffice
to
say
that
for
that
period
of
time,
and
until
he
was
given
a
deportation
hearing
which
is
a
departmental
hearing,
which
he
had
local
counsel
down
in
texas,
it
was
six
weeks
later
that
for
the
first
time
upon
his
being
indicted
back
in
brooklyn,
it
was
six
weeks
after
his
seizure
that
for
the
first
time
this
man
appeared
in
a
unites
states
court.
now,
this
is
the
set
of
facts
with
which
we
have
to
deal.
now,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
issues
that
are
before
the
court?
is
this
just
another
case
such
as
those
that
the
government
has
been
citing
in
their
brief
of
(inaudible)
against
the
commissioner
and
whether
or
not,
he
should
have
used
the
bread
knife
when
they
apprehended
him
for
deportation.
is
that
all
that's
involved
in
this
case?
definitely
not.
this
case
involves
tremendous
problems
of
great
importance
to
the
united
states.
these
problems
are
very
old
problems
in
world
history.
they
happen
for
reasons
which
i
will
explain
in
a
moment,
to
come
for
the
first
time
before
this
court,
because
they
couldn't
quite
have
come
in
the
present
context
before
this
court
until
1947.
now,
what
are
these
problems
and
what
are
the
basic
issues
that
this
court
should
resolve?
the
basic
issue
is
the
measure
to
which
it
--
a
--
those
possessing
power
of
internal
security
in
any
country
are
permitted,
in
the
interest
of
internal
security,
to
infringe
the
constitutional
rights
of
people
living
in
that
country.
now,
this
is
a
very
old
problem.
it
existed
back
with
the
roman
emperors
as
to
who
controlled
the
praetorian
guard.
it
existed
under
the
medicis.
it
existed
in
england
for
centuries,
existed
under
richelieu,
france.
it
existed
in
our
own
date,
culminating
in
the
gestapo
in
nazi
germany
and
the
cheka
in
soviet
russia.
this
is
a
tremendous
problem
to
what
degree
in
the
interest
of
internal
security
do
you
permit?
those
living
in
the
country
to
be
deprived
of
basic
liberties.
we
will
have
seen
in
our
own
time
examples
of
these.
of
both
phases
of
what
i
have
mentioned
actually,
we
not
only
have
seen
the
manner
in
which
a
tyranny
can
keep
itself
in
power
by
the
control
of
its
internal
security
forces,
we
have
also
seen
when
korea
became
premier
of
russia,
how
he
who
controls
internal
security
can
assume
the
throne.
now,
in
the
united
states,
until
the
national
intelligence
act
of
1947,
the
united
states
had
never
had
a
true
intelligence
and
counterintelligence
setup.
in
england,
they've
had
it
since
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth.
but
in
the
united
states,
we
never
did.
actually,
during
war
time,
officers
would
be
assigned
to
g2
or
o&i
normally
as
anyone
with
service
experience
knows
at
that
time,
peak
on
the
ground,
they're
either
too
young
or
not
properly
fitted
to
command
troops
or
command
a
ship.
and
g2
and
o&i,
and
these
various
set
of
forces
actually
worked
all
alone
--
it
is
very
little
communication
between
them.
for
the
first
time
during
world
war
ii,
a
coordinated
united
states
intelligence
service
was
created.
now,
at
the
conclusion
of
world
war
ii,
with
the
dissolution
of
the
office
of
strategic
services,
this
tremendously
important
problem
was
reviewed
by
congress.
it's
perfectly
evident
that
in
a
day
of
intercontinental
missiles
armed
with
thermonuclear
warheads,
it
is
vitally
important
to
the
united
states
that
we
--
the
--
the
decisions
that
we
make
are
policy
decisions
by
the
president,
by
the
state
department,
be
informed
decisions.
this
is
very
important.
to
what
extent
can
we
ascertain
the
--
not
only
the
capabilities
of
foreign
nations,
but
their
intentions
toward
the
united
states.
if
for
example
we
had
reliable
intelligence
that
the
communist
world
did
not
intend
military
conquests,
but
were
relying
on
economic
warfare
and
propaganda,
think
of
the
tremendous
impact
his
would
have
on
the
day-to-day
economy
and
tax
problems
in
the
united
states.
now,
bearing
all
these
in
mind,
in
1947,
after
several
years
of
study
of
this
problem,
congress
acted
and
congress
created
the
central
intelligence
agency.
now,
citations
to
all
these
appear
in
my
briefs.
you'll
find
no
reference
to
any
of
these
matters
in
any
of
the
government's
brief.
but
the
court
will
find
when
it
examines
these
statutes
and
the
legislative
history
of
them
that
while
on
the
one
hand,
congress
was
very
determined
to
--
to
create
a
permanent
central
intelligence
agency
such
as
now
exist.
it
was
equally
determined
to
see
to
it
that
that
agency
did
not
operate
within
the
continental
borders
of
the
united
states,
where
it
could
become
an
agency
in
which
the
internal
security
functions
began
to
transcend
the
rights
of
our
individual
residents
in
the
united
states.
accordingly,
the
court
will
find
that
just
as
congress
caught
out
this
area
for
the
central
intelligence
agency,
they
reserved
all
domestic
problems
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
within
the
department
of
justice.
now,
this
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
this
is
not
a
simple
deportation
matter.
these
are
matters
of
fundamental
importance.
now,
in
my
principal
briefs,
on
page
12,
i
caught
the
court's
attention
to
an
extraordinary
statement.
and
i
would
like
to
read
this
statement
to
the
court
because
it
is
so
pertinent
to
what
this
case
is
really
all
about.
and
i
want
to
read
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
although
this
statement
was
included
in
the
first
affidavits
i
submitted
in
the
united
states
district
court,
from
that
day
to
this,
no
reference
to
this
statement
has
ever
appeared
in
any
government
brief,
nor
any
reference
by
the
district
court,
nor
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
now,
what
does
this
say?
first
of
all,
it
is
taken
from
a
bestseller
which
by
now
has
been
read
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
the
united
states
citizens.
the
title
of
the
book
is,
“the
fbi
story”
by
whitehead.
and
as
i
point
out,
the
foreword
is
authoritative.
it's
by
j.
edgar
hoover,
director
of
the
f.b.i.
he
states
that
the
f.b.i.
has
complete
confidence
in
the
author's
integrity,
ability
and
objectivity
and
the
facts
reported
are
supported
by
the
bureau's
record.
now,
with
respect
to
how
this
law
enforcement
agency
which
has
these
counterintelligence
powers
is
operating
today
with
respect
to
a
suspected
espionage
agent,
what
do
they
say?
“the
f.b.i.
conducts
two
types
of
security
investigations,
one-to-one
cover
admissible
evidence,
to
be
used
in
the
prosecution
of
an
individual
or
group
in
federal
court.
the
other
for
intelligence
purposes
only.”
the
intelligence
investigation
is
intended
to
identify
and
determine
the
activities
of
individuals
who
are
potentially
dangerous
to
the
nation's
security,
thereby
supplying
information
on
which
to
--
base
preventive
or
counter
espionage
action.
often
clandestine
methods
are
necessary
to
uncover
clandestine
operations.
as
for
example,
obtaining
an
espionage
agent's
diary
for
secret
papers,
the
evidence
in
the
diary
maybe
inadmissible
in
federal
court,
but
it
may
contain
information
which
would
enable
the
united
states
to
protect
itself
at
a
later
date.
this
is
in
contrast
to
a
case
where
legal
evidence
admissible
in
court
has
to
be
obtained
to
convict
the
espionage
agent
of
violating
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
this
is
a
full
statement
that
investigations
of
searches
and
seizures
are
regularly
conducted
in
--
in
this
area
and
that's
the
area
of
this
case,
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
i
am
not
being
critical
of
mr.
hoover
in
any
manner.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no.
and
i
--
the
last
objective
in
the
world
i
have
in
getting
into
this
is
in
anyway
to
--
to
embarrass
his
grey
evidence.
however,
all
i
am
pointing
out
is,
this
is
the
most
important
part
of
this
case.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
statement
should
be
disavowed
by
the
government
or
explained
by
the
government.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
either
case
where
this
court
is
dealing
with
fundamentals
charting
a
cause
of
action
as
to
this
entire
vital
area,
surely
the
court
is
entitled
to
have
it
discussed.
at
least
we're
entitled
to
know
more
about
these
clandestine
operations.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
it's
perfectly
evident
that
--
that
if
they
wish
to
--
to
seize
articles
which
they
must
show
were
seized
in
compliance
with
the
federal
constitution
and
laws,
the
statement
is
that
they
operate
one
way
and
that
otherwise
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
that
they
operate
in
what
they
term,
a
clandestine
way.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
this
is
not
my
statement;
this
is
a
statement
of
a
man
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that's
the
--
that's
the
[laughs]
only
way
i
would
construe
with
this
use
of
the
english
language.
now,
all
that
i
am
saying
is
at
least
this
should
be
discussed
and
i've
pointed
out,
it's
been
ignored
in
every
government
brief.
now,
with
respect
to
mr.
hoover,
to
me,
this
is
the
forthright
direct
statement
of
a
forthright
man.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
these
forthright
qualities
in
mr.
hoover,
which
i
find
quite
admirable,
the
government
seems
to
find
rather
disconcerting.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
mr.
hoover
gave
his
unqualified
endorsement
to
these
statements,
your
honor,
in
the
preface
to
the
book.
now,
while
we're
on
this
subject
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
these
are
facts.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
do
you
think,
your
honor,
it
would've
been
a
bestseller
if
--
if
mr.
hoover
in
the
--
in
the
preface
had
not
said
that
the
f.b.i.'s
complete
competence
and
his
integrity,
ability
and
objectivity
and
the
facts
reported
as
supported
by
bureau's
record?
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
we're
in
an
area
where
there
is
not
too
much
material
on
this
preside
subject
for
rather
obvious
reasons
which
i
could
present
to
the
court.
i
regard
it
as
my
duty
to
bring
before
you
anything
that
is
pertinent
to
the
controversy.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
now,
i
have
further
argued
at
my
brief,
your
honor,
that
precisely
this
clandestine
method
of
operation
is
an
accurate
description
of
what
happened
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
it's
perfectly
evident,
incidentally,
that
throughout
this
entire
controversy,
the
court
will
note
that
on
oral
argument
the
last
time.
i
carefully
stated
that
i
was
not
quarreling
with
what
was
done
in
this
case
in
that
prospectively,
it
obviously
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states
instead
of
arresting
him
for
the
misdemeanor
of
being
illegally
in
the
country.
that
since
his
confederate
had
already
come
over
to
our
side,
prospectively,
it
is
obviously
in
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states
that
an
effort
be
made
to
secure
a
man
who
is
said
to
be
the
chief
of
all
russian
espionage
in
the
united
states
and
try
to
induce
him
to
follow
his
subordinate
and
come
over
to
our
side.
if
this
can
be
done,
it's
a
triumph
in
counterintelligence.
at
a
minimum,
you
obtain
complete
information
on
the
enemy's
spy
apparatus.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
beg
your
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
haven't
suggested
that,
your
honor.
i
haven't
suggested
that.
i
am
saying
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
this
actually
gets
back
to
the
discussion
i
was
having
with
justice
harlan.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
i
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
criticize
what
they
did
in
making
the
effort
to
convert
an
enemy
intelligence
agency.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
having
gone
down
that
road
and
spent
six
weeks
down
in
texas
without
public
disclosure
in
this
endeavor,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
having
taken
that
gamble
and
failed,
that
they
cannot
come
back
up
to
new
york,
indict
him,
try
among
all
the
evidences
that
they
seized
is
in
that
manner
and
then
pretend
to
give
lip
service
to
due
process
of
law.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
they
violated
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
i
think
--
i
think
that
we
can
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
these
administrative
alien
warrants
served
many
such
handy
purposes
and
that
a
great
many
similar
gentlemen
wind
up
in
mexico.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i'm
defending
due
process
of
law
in
the
united
states
in
this
case
and
i'm
saying
it
was
violated
in
this
case
and
that
if
this
court
permits
this
to
--
to
continue
and
lays
down
a
rule
of
law,
that
this
can
be
done,
it's
perfectly
evident
the
department
of
justice
no
longer
will
obtain
criminal
warrants
and
alien
espionage
cases.
they'll
simply
use
methods
of
this
type
and
i'm
saying
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
sanction
this
kind
of
thing
when
a
man
is
prosecuted
for
a
capital
crime
and
convicted
on
the
evidence
thus
obtained.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
justice
frankfurter
and
i
were
debating
really
more
the
morality
of
what
was
the
--
that
the
legality.
i'm
trying
as
best
i
can
to
say
that
in
this
case,
the
man's
legal
rights
were
violated
and
in
the
other
hand
that
that
obviously
is
enormously
in
the
national
interest
to
have
effective
counterintelligence.
and
i'm
saying
that
it's
up
to
this
court
in
this
case,
in
my
judgment,
on
these
issues
to
lay
out
the
pattern
of
conduct
as
to
what
is
constitutional
and
what
is
not.
and
until
this
court
speaks,
all
i
can
have
are
personal
opinions.
now,
with
respect
--
again,
to
what
i
am
describing
as
the
jugular
vein
of
this
case,
since
the
oral
argument,
further
light
has
been
shed
on
this
field
and
this
time
justice
frankfurter,
on
this
specific
case
and
under
the
signature
of
j.
edgar
hoover.
a
new
book
has
been
published
which
currently
is
a
bestseller
which
is
entitled,
“masters
of
deceit
-
the
story
of
communism
in
america
and
how
to
fight
it.”
and
i
pointed
out
in
my
supplemental
brief
that
on
page
298
of
that
book,
director
hoover
has
made
the
following
statements.
and
i
suggest
that
they'd
be
read
very
carefully.
such
was
the
case
of
colonel
rudolf
ivanovich
abel
of
soviet
intelligence,
who
was
arrested
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
june
1957,
at
the
request
of
the
f.b.i.,
after
we
had
identified
them
as
a
concealed
agent.
after
his
indictment
in
august
1957
on
espionage
charges,
information
was
made
public
concerning
him,
which
the
f.b.i.
could
not
previously
disclose.
now,
what
does
this
mean?
this
means
that
it
is
exactly
as
though
i
asked
director
hoover
who
as
i
have
repeatedly
said,
is
a
very
forthright
individual,
two
questions,
one,
“mr.
hoover,
did
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
take
the
steps
which
they
did
using
these
warrants,
getting
him
onto
the
plane,
throwing
him
into
solitary
confinement
in
mcallen,
texas,
did
they
take
their
actions
at
your
request?”
and
his
answer
is,
yes.
now
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
important,
“mr.
hoover,
was
it
your
best
judgment
at
the
time
that
until
the
man
was
indicted,
that
information
concerning
his
activity
should
not
be
made
public?”
now,
i
am
just
pointing
out
that
here
are
two
statements
which
--
of
which
in
my
judgment,
this
court
will
take
judicial
notice.
here
are
two
statements
on
this
precise
field
and
this
precise
case.
and
on
what
is
the
big
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
the
extent
to
which
this
court
is
going
to
tell
our
law
enforcement
officials,
the
extent
to
which
they
can
use
this
new
counter-intelligent
powers
which
they've
invested
in
the
united
states
and
where
the
borderline
must
be
drawn
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
liberties
and
rights
of
those
who
live
in
the
united
states.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
your
honor,
first,
i've
never
had
such
a
case
and
i'm
not
sure
i'd
take
it
if
i
were
offered
it,
but
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
but,
in
answer
to
you
question,
it
would
be
my
best
judgment
that
the
bureau
possessing
such
information
has
indeed
a
duty
to
transmit
it
to
immigration
and
naturalization.
but
with
respect
to
whether
i
could
successfully
protest
the
steps
that
followed
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
but
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
but
they
did
use
--
but
they
did
use,
your
honor,
under
your
hypothetical,
they
did
use
these
administrative
warrants.
and
as
i
explain
to
justice
harlan
before,
in
a
case
where
it
did
become
very
important
to
go
in
to
every
phase
of
those,
i
believe
i
would
develop
the
point
which
i
did
make
in
my
petition
pertaining
to
the
lack
of
procedural
safeguards
in
these
warrants.
in
other
words,
your
honor,
if
you
recall,
we
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
the
last
argument.
it
lacks
virtually
every
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
--
if
immigration
and
naturalization
can't
rely
in
information
they
kept
from
the
f.b.i.,
i
don't
know
on
what
else
they
could
act.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
and
the
two
are
agencies
--
should
cooperate
together,
but
all
i'm
explaining
is
that
there
is
a
degree
here
and
this
entire
case
shows
us
that
in
which
in
my
judgment,
this
man
was
denied
due
process
of
law.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
no.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
--
and
couldn't,
because
actually
under
the
federal
reorganization
act,
immigration
and
naturalization,
it
should
never
be
forgotten
and
the
f.b.i.
of
both
component
parts
with
injustice.
in
other
words,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
director
of
the
f.b.i.
does
report
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
as
does
the
director
of
immigration
and
naturalization.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
as
a
citizen,
i
would
--
i
would
hope
that
many
such
conversations
take
place,
your
honor,
on
matters
of
mutual
interest.
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
procedures
available
to
the
one
for
certain
purposes
can't
be
used
in
another
way.
accordingly,
for
all
the
reasons
which
i've
set
forth
before
the
court
and
with
the
authorities
that
i
have
set
forth
in
the
briefs
that
have
been
submitted
to
the
court,
it's
my
contention
as
it
was
in
the
district
court,
that
the
seizure
of
this
man,
seizure
of
all
its
effect,
using
these
administrative
warrants,
taking
him
down
to
texas,
and
six
weeks
after
he
was
seized,
first
seeing
the
inside
of
a
court
and
then
on
that
background,
that
the
man
be
indicted
for
a
capital
crime,
tried
and
convicted
on
the
massive
evidence
produced
in
that
manner
is
my
contention
that
the
rights
granted
to
all
in
the
united
states
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
have
been
violated
that
this
judgment
must
be
reversed,
the
matter
remanded
to
district
court
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
have
this,
your
honor,
but
this
belongs
to
the
eastern
district
court
and
i
promised
to
return
it,
but
i
can
if
your
honors
would
wish
this,
i
--
i
frankly
assumed
that
copies
of
these
came
up
with
the
entire
record.
i
only
found
yesterday
afternoon
that
there
comes
up
to
this
court
only
what's
on
the
docket
and
they
don't
docket
these.
i
will
be
very
happy
to
have
this
reproduced
and
properly
furnished
and
its
sufficient
member
to
the
court.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i'm
very
glad
to,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
intend
to
make
no
details
of
why,
but
nevertheless,
there
are
i
think
a
variety
of
matters
here
that
should
be
cleared
up
because
at
certain
times
this
afternoon
i
was
gradually
coming
to
the
impression
that
i
was
in
three
other
cases.
now
in
the
first
place,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
this
time
within
which
to
get
a
warrant,
you
will
find
that
appendix
b
in
our
principal
brief
makes
very
clear
that
they
had
over
a
month
in
which
to
obtain
a
warrant
because
over
a
month
before
this
they
not
only
had
hayhanen's
testimony
but
had
corroboration
from
what
was
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
next
your
honor,
with
respect
to
his
being
advised
that
he
could
have
counsel,
you
will
find
that
such
a
statement
was
made
but
no
statement
as
to
when
he
could
have
the
counsel.
you
will
find
that
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
we
carefully
set
forth
the
citation
to
the
provision
of
these
regulations
and
the
warrant
makes
this
also
clear
that
under
the
existing
rules,
this
right
to
counsel
is
the
right
to
be
represented
later
at
the
formal
proceeding.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
so
far
--
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
your
honor,
you
will
find
that
this
statement
he
was
told
he
could
have
counsel
but
not
as
to
when
he
could
have
counsel
and
i'm
explaining
that
under
that
customary
procedures
which
i've
cited
in
the
appendix,
it's
in
a
from
of
regulation.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
a
man
from
immigration
and
naturalization,
your
honor.
they
agreed
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
at
--
at
the
hearing
which
preceded
the
trial.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
i'm
beginning
to
wonder
about
that,
your
honor.
if
the
--
several
of
these
discussions
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
(voice
overlap)
have
to
know
that
i
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
the
answer
is
yes
and
he
got
a
lawyer
that
made
everyone
of
these
points.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
with
a
(voice
overlap)
great
difficulty
in
the
court
below
i'd
like
to
call
to
your
attention
that
one
of
my
four
points
of
certiorari
was
that
the
conduct
of
the
court
below
including
the
difficulties
of
the
defense
was
such
as
to
exercise
or
call
for
an
exercise
of
this
court's
supervisory
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
it's
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
believe
it
was
when
mr.
maroney
was
examined
by
one
of
the
ins
agents.
a
question
was
asked
was
he
told.
and
this
was
corroborated
by
one
of
the
fbi
agents.
but
i'm
just
pointing
out
your
honor
that
under
this
regulation,
it
says,
“notice
of
right
to
counsel
and
release
from
custody.
on
service
of
the
warrant
of
arrest,
the
alien
shall
be
advised
of
his
right
to
representation
by
counsel,
at
no
expense
to
the
government
at
the
hearing
to
be
held
under
the
warrant
of
arrest.”
and
so
too,
as
amended
that
this
so
far
as
i
know
is
still
a
procedure.
this
again
justice
harlan,
in
the
event
of
a
deportation
proceeding,
this
again
would
be
something
that
would
have
to
be
brought
into
a
great
detail,
but
i'm
just
--
just
pointing
that
out
and
with
respect
to
his
knowing
his
rights
under
these
circumstances
of
course
is
absurd.
now
this
argument,
justice
brennan,
about
the
fact
that
a
crime
was
being
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
arresting
officers,
this
isn't
a
fraud
and
this
--
this
is
a
new
thought
in
the
government
side.
this
cuts
two
ways
because
if
that
was
so,
under
the
harris
case,
they
had
a
great
duty
to
have
with
that
foreknowledge
to
have
obtained
a
warrant
for
the
man's
arrest.
now,
with
respect
to
how
general
was
the
seizure,
i
can't
make
it
more
unqualified
than
this.
they
seized
everything
belonging
to
that
man
in
that
room.
every
one
of
his
possessions
and
after
leaving,
came
back
and
searched
the
waste
paper
basket.
there
could
be
no
more
general
a
seizure
than
was
made,
that's
number
one.
number
two,
to
what
did
i
object?
you
will
find
that
the
papers
that
i
drew
at
that
time
objected
to
every
item
which
they
seized.
now,
before
this
--
the
trial
commenced,
judge
byers
in
what's
a
perfect
normal
thing,
said,
“well,
with
how
many
items
are
we
dealing?”
he
had
hundreds
of
paintings
for
example.
“are
all
these
involved
in
this
motion?
it
would
aid
me
if
counsel
could
agree
as
to
what
are
involved.”
whereupon,
the
government
said,
“well
this
is
involved,
this
isn't
so.”
now,
what's
involved
in
the
question
before
this
court?
in
appendix
c,
on
page
41
of
my
principal
brief,
i
made
reference
to
this
on
the
original
argument.
we
have
set
forth
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
dozens
and
dozens
of
items
that
are
involved
in
this
question
and
as
to
every
one
of
those
items,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
question
embraced
under
my
original
motion
and
i
have
never
withdrawn
one
contention
in
this
respect
as
from
the
first
day
that
i
commenced
to
proceed.
we
divided
these
items
for
your
convenience
into
one.
item
c
is
at
the
latham
which
were
introduced
as
exhibits
of
the
espionage
trial.
we've
given
a
page
number
where
they
were
identified
the
page
number
were
received.
(b)
item
(c)
is
at
the
latham
which
were
used
to
obtain
exhibits
introduced
at
the
espionage
trial.
item
c,
additional
item
c
is
at
the
latham
concerning
which
testimony
was
offered
at
the
espionage
trial.
and
finally
item
c
is
at
the
latham
which
were
used
by
the
department
of
justice
to
procure
a
search
warrant
for
espionage
materials.
and
then
finally,
several
other
items
all
of
which
were
identified
and
received
at
the
trial,
it's
this
whole
mass
of
evidence
that
we're
dealing
with.
and
this
discussion
about
five
items
or
seven
items
is
--
is
in
my
judgment
absurd.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
all
of
these
was
used.
in
appendix
c,
i've
given
page
number
of
when
it
was
identified
and
when
it
was
received
in
evidence.
we're
talking
about
several
hundred
items.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
it
obviously
is
the
argument
which
was
given
to
the
circuit
court
and
the
circuit
court
adopted
that
this
is
a
little
evidence.
this
is
just
a
little
evidence.
there
were
only
seven
items.
and
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
i'm
not
responsible
for
computation.
i'm
just
explaining
that
without
contradiction
by
the
government,
we
spent
weeks
compiling
all
these
items.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
and
that
is
correct.
in
other
words
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
but
--
but
your
honor,
the
--
the
--
this
massive
evidence
was
obtained
by
using
search
warrants
which
are
in
the
record,
which
were
obtained
on
the
basis
of
reciting
everything
that
was
seized
at
the
hotel
latham.
so
under
established
decisions
of
this
court,
they
are
involved
just
as
much
as
those
original.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
let
me
explain,
your
honor.
they
--
they
first
made
this
general
seizure.
we
can
talk
about
the
seven
items
that
were
in
that
hotel
room.
then
armed
with
the
information
obtained
as
the
result
of
what
i
contend
as
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
they
went
and
got
several
search
warrants
over
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
and
used
these
to
go
through
his
studio
over
in
brooklyn
at
which
they
obtained
additional
(inaudible).
they
also
obtained
leads
and
so
on
from,
all
stemming
from
the
original
illegal
search
and
seizure
at
the
latham.
and
under
the
rules
of
this
court
and
of
the
second
circuit,
i
have
sought
to
bundle
all
these
together
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
but
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is,
that
this
entire
mass
of
evidence
objected
to
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
not
only
are
we
--
of
my
affidavits
in
the
court
below
but
also
of
this
memoranda
of
law
to
which
i've
made
reference
will
show
that
we
contested
every
bit
of
what
was
evidence.
now,
with
respect
to
this
arrest
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
believe
the
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
believe,
yes.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
they
were
in
the
hollowed
out
pencil,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor
--
your
honor,
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
--
that
my
motion
was
addressed
to
my
objections
to
the
trial
were
addressed
to
and
my
argument
in
this
court
is
addressed
to
this
entire
mass
of
evidence.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
these
two
letters
--
my
recollection
your
honor,
are
the
ones
which
purported
to
be
in
his
family.
is
that
correct?
they
were
in
microfilms
too,
your
honor.
now,
turning
to
this
question
of
the
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
well,
your
honor,
in
their
opinion
that
is
what
they
decided
on
but
i
made
to
that
court
the
same
argument
i'm
making
here.
and
your
honor
will
find
that
all
the
proceedings
of
the
district
court
relate
in
the
broadest
possible
language
to
every
thing
not
only
seized
at
the
latham
but
on
leads,
on
leads
obtained
at
latham.
this
is
made
perfectly
clear
in
the
affidavits
of
the
district
court
and
in
the
memoranda
of
law.
now,
turning
to
this
question
of
what
was
the
arrest?
first,
let
me
--
let
me
say
that
as
i
would
understand
the
government's
argument
this
afternoon,
it
is
as
say,
gertrude
stein
might
have
expressed
it,
“an
arrest
is
an
arrest
is
an
arrest”.
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
an
arrest
was
made
in
this
case,
until
the
decision
of
this
court.
i
know
that
i
won't
because
as
justice
black
suggested,
in
the
memorandum
of
law
which
i've
now
submitted
to
justice
clark,
you
will
find
that
--
that
my
point
was,
this
was
not
a
criminal
arrest.
therefore,
it
must
be
a
civil
arrest
and
not
only
am
i
confused
in
the
point
but
the
last
i
know
so
is
the
department
of
justice
because
their
answering
memorandum
to
me
said
that
it
was
an
arrest
sui
generis.
i
have
never
heard
of
arrest
sui
generis
and
i
still
don't
quite
understand
that.
now,
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
whatever
you
decide,
whatever
kind
of
an
arrest
it
was,
i
object
to
it
in
this
case.
[laughter]
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor,
any
morning
at
7:30,
when
two
men
push
their
into
my
house
and
while
i'm
naked,
as
the
evidence
shows
in
this
case,
and
begin
to
question
me
showing
me
envelopes
from
the
fbi,
this
could
be
a
little
difficult.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
most
assuredly
would.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
your
honor
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
this
suggestion
that
they
really
were
there,
i'm
beginning
to
learn
to
helpfully
pack
them
in.
they
were
really
being
--
mr.
james
b.
donovan
--
helpful.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
would
only
be
discourteous.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
would
only
be
discourteous
but
i
suggest
that
it
perfectly
evident
in
this
case
that
more
than
discourtesy
was
involved.
it's
perfectly
everyone
knows
that
the
f.b.i
is
under
regulations
to
always
be
armed.
that
two
armed
men
break
into
my
house
in
the
--
in
the
morning
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
here
and
precisely
the
same
rule's
involved
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
b.
donovan
i
do.
now,
finally,
i
again
want
respectfully
to
bring
the
court
back
to
what
i
contend
is
the
major
issue
in
this
case.
at
one
point
this
afternoon,
i
thought
that
the
major
issue
was
whether
the
rule
of
the
court
that
now
only
extends
to
four
rooms
whether
it
should
be
extended
to
a
room
and
bed.
what
is
at
stake
in
this
matter?
and
the
issue
that
must
be
decided
by
you
is
the
extent
to
which
internal
security
shall
be
permitted
to
prevail
over
constitutional
guarantees.
now,
what
does
this
issue
mean?
it
means
that
there
are
inherent
difficulties
in
a
democracy
in
attempting
efficient
counter
intelligence
and
there
are
degrees
of
efficiency.
does
a
decision
in
this
case
that
these
methods
can't
be
permitted
mean
that
we
have
no
counter
intelligence?
no.
but
on
the
other
hand,
do
we
want
so
efficient
a
counter
intelligence
in
the
united
states
as
the
gestapo
or
la
chica.
this
is
an
inherent
part
of
democracy.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
in
deciding
this
question,
which
i
would
assume
is
the
only
reason
this
court
would
have
taken
certiorari
in
this
case,
that
in
deciding
that
question
that
the
court
advert
to
the
argument
which
i've
made
in
my
original
argument,
and
that
is
that
even
as
a
matter
of
national
defense,
the
most
important
thing
to
united
states
today
is
to
maintain
our
way
of
life
in
a
free
society
held
out
to
the
other
nations
of
the
world
that
they
have
something
to
aspire
to.
now,
i
say
that
kind
of
a
way
of
life
is
the
kind
of
way
of
life
that
is
threatened
in
precisely
this
case
and
that
violates
a
democracy
that
was
created
by
people
who
had
fled
from
precisely
this
kind
of
thing
and
who
carefully
provided
in
the
fourth
amendment
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizure
shall
not
be
violated
and
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause,
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched,
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
that
kind
of
simple
language
is
what
created
the
society
we
live
in.
that
rule
has
been
violated
in
this
case,
and
i
respectfully
ask
that
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed.
thank
you.
