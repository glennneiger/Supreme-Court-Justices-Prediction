justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
as
the
interrogation
was
done
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
interrogation
by
you
at
the
trial
to
--
that
used
evidence
that
could
support
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
get
anywhere
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
get
anywhere
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
donovan,
you
go
beyond
what
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested.
namely,
this
far,
that
even
though
this
whole
operation
had
been
an
i.n.s.
operation
originally
conceived
as
such,
carried
out
as
such,
the
evidence
then
seized,
even
though
usable
in
the
deportation
proceeding,
could
not,
however,
honestly
purpose
of
the
department
in
conducting
that
operation
the
way
they
did,
but
not
have
been
used
as
evidence
on
the
criminal
prosecution.
are
you
going
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
are
you
--
you're
going
so
far
then
as
to
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
or
not
this
was
a
subterfuge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nevertheless,
since
it
was
received
incident
through
a
--
an
i.n.s.
administrative
warrant,
the
evidence
could
not
be
used
to
support
a
criminal
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
donovan,
let
me
button
up
one
more
thing
before
you
--
before
i
let
you
go.
very
early
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
whether
the
procedure
that
was
followed
here
wasn't
justified
or
induced
by
the
conviction
of
the
department
that
to
make
any
kind
of
disclosure
or
even
to
(inaudible)
the
disclosure
being
made
illegal
would
frustrate
the
whole
purpose
of
what
you
yourself
regard
as
a
highly
desirable
end.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
whether
a
search
warrant
could
have
been
filed
under
seize,
seeking
to
get
the
things
that
the
administrative
process
sought
to
get
without
imperiling
or
embarrassing
or
jeopardizing
in
the
slightest,
that
laudable
desire.

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
on
this
occasion
that
that's
a
--
an
affidavit
of
a
matter
of
any
attention
that
you
would
have
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that's
a
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
relation
to
the
--
search
in
relation
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understood
it,
the
first
presentation
to
the
grand
jury
was
after
july
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
no
--
he
--
he
was
naked,
as
i
understand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
when
the
officers
came
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
one
was
this
--
the
code
message,
that's
the
one
that
he
was
attempting
to
put
up
the
sleeve.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
who
took
that?
the
--
the
immigration
agents
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
immigration.
then
the
second
group
consisted
of
the
false
martin
collins
birth
certificate,
the
false
emil
goldfus
birth
certificate,
the
vaccination
certificate,
mark
collins
and
the
bank
book
in
favor
of
goldfus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
where
--
where
were
each
of
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
not
quite
clear
about
is
when
you
say
“in
his
belongings,”
in
the
suits
of
clothes
or
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
dress
drawers
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
again,
who
--
who
was
it
that
--
that
found
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
immigration
agent.
then
finally,
there's
this
trick
sandpaper
block,
which
had
the
cipher
pad
and
a
hollowed-out
wooden
pencil
with
a
microfilm.
now,
both
of
those
were
in
the
wastepaper
basket.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
those
are
the
two,
are
they,
that
the
f.b.i.
agents
recovered
from
the
wastepaper
basket
after
he
had
left
the
room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
can
you
tell
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
defend
the
use
of
these
three
categories
on
the
same
ground
or
on
different
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
then
--
that
would
cover
the
sandpaper
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
block
and
the
hollowed-out
wooden
pencil.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
how
about
the
other
two
categories?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
birth
certificates,
the
vaccination
certificate
and
the
bank
book,
i
take
it,
would
all
be
relevant
to
a
deportation
proceeding,
would
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
the
--
what
about
the
code
message?
that
would
not
be
relevant,
would
it,
to
the
deportation
as
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
get
one
other
thing
straight.
you've
already
told
us
that
on
the
third
category,
those
you
--
the
government's
position
is
they're
admissible
since
they
have
been
abandoned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
on
the
other
two
categories,
do
you
rest
the
admissibility
of
them
as
incident
to
the
administrative
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
on
any
other
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
arrest,
their
admissibility
as
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
or
as
incident
to
the
use
of
the
administrative
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
whether
the
government
is
or
isn't
resting
their
admissibility
as
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
before
you
get
to
answering
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
which
i'm
also
anxious
to
hear
you
answer,
gets
the
more
on
the
bright
side
out
of
the
way.
if
you
are
wrong,
the
government
is
wrong
that
any
or
all
of
this
search
and
seizure
cannot
be
supported
on
the
administrative
warrant,
are
you
making
any
argument
as
to
any
of
those
items
and
if
so,
which
ones
that
their
admission
in
face
of
the
fact
that
you
get
hayhanen
finally
to
testify
was
harmless
error?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
there
were
any
harmless
error,
you'd
limit
that
to
those
which
are
really
related
to
the
deportation,
i
gather,
not
so
much
to
the
espionage
and
that's
the
birth
certificates,
vaccination
certificate
and
the
bank
book.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
did
the
order
to
show
cause
or
turn
into
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
already
waiting
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
that's
the
hearing
in
response
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
provision
of
the
order
to
show
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
--
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question
earlier
that
i
want
to
be
clear
that
you
are
resting
upon
the
legality
of
this
--
use
of
this
administrative
warrant
and
nothing
more.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
glad
now
that
it
came
up
again
because
i
have
the
other
understanding
from
your
answer
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
crime
was
being
a
crime
or
crimes
that
was
being
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
arresting
officer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
would
that
then
to
say
that
the
possession
of
the
two
birth
certificates
or
the
vaccination
certificate
and
of
the
bank
book
were
evidence
of
the
commission
in
the
presence
of
officers
of
that
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
those
then
were
the
evidence
of
the
commission
in
their
presence
of
the
crime
you
just
described.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
as
to
the
code
up
the
sleeve,
what
was
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
commission
of
the
crime
of
espionage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
so
were
they
all
taken
from
the
latham,
mr.
donovan,
or
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
--
they
break
the
door
down?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
mr.
donovan
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
you
raised
this
under
most
of
the
threats
that
constitutes
acquittal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
what
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
those
who
prove
the
indictment?
everything
that
talks
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
may,
but
it's
on
the
--
but
i
had
the
impression
in
effect,
but
in
this
context,
it's
not
--
would
have
been
the
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
related
to
everything
else
that
the
warrants,
whatever
use
they
might
have
--
valid
use
for
other
purposes
was
not
to
be
relied
on
to
support
the
use
of
the
evidence
here,
against
him
in
the
--
under
the
espionage
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor
general,
to
the
extent
that
you
were
relying
upon
a
crime
being
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
officers,
this
presupposes
a
lawful
entity
for
the
purposes
of
making
an
arrest,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
could
any
of
this
had
happened
if
they
had
not
entered
the
room
for
the
purposes
of
making
an
arrest
to
the
extent
you
rely
on
the
crime
being
committed
in
their
presence
as
justifying
the
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
--
suppose
though
one
is
invited
in
and
the
officer
invited
in
doesn't
know
that
this
chap
is
an
alien
illegally
in
the
united
states
somehow
under
these
you've
picked
up
aren't
the
issue
here.
later,
the
government
learns
that
in
fact
this
fellow
was
an
alien
illegally
in
the
united
states.
may
you
then
justify
picking
these
things
and
using
him
an
evidence
on
the
ground
that
well
in
fact
he
was
committing
a
crime
in
the
presence
of
the
officer
or
the
officer
didn't
know
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
was
trying
get
clear
is
that
your
position
then
is
that
there
must
be
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
arresting
officer
that
the
crime
is
being
committed
in
his
presence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
way
that
knowledge
existed
here
was
that
they
had
foreknowledge
that
he
probably
was
the
agent
masquerading
as
goldfus
and
collins,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
knew
that
at
time
they
entered
the
room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
your
whole
argument
then
is
premised
on
their
actual
knowledge
that
this
particular
individual
had
not
registered
and
therefore
while
in
the
presence
of
the
officers,
he
was
still
committing
that
same
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
the
record
show
they
had
checked
in
fact,
whether
a
martin
collins
had
registered
or
whether
an
emil
goldfus
had
registered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
three?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
based
on
the
fact
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
knew
he
was
abel
not
that
he
was
using
the
name
collins
or
goldfus
or
that
he
was
collins
or
goldfus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
had
in
fact
the
martin
collins,
he
wouldn't
have
to
register
because
then
he
would
have
been
an
american-born
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he'd
in
fact
been
goldfus,
he
would
not
have
had
to
register.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it
must
have
rested
on
the
fact
that
one
abel
hadn't
registered,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
in
this
record,
there
is
a
testimony
in
this
record
that
whoever
it
was
and
said
he
might
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
leave
it
mr.
donovan,
just
look
at
your
(a),
your
item
(a)
there
at
--
at
page
41.
now,
there
under
(a),
you
have
here
ten
exhibit
numbers
and
the
pages
that
which
respectively,
they
were
received.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
87
is
the
hollow
pencils,
now
when
was
that?
is
that
what
they
took
from
the
waste
paper
basket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
true
also
of
the
hollow
block
of
wood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
about
the
microfilms,
97.
is
that
--
were
those
microfilms
included
in
either
the
pencil
or
the
block
of
wood
when
they
found
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
there
are
10
items
and
we're
talking
about
seven.
now,
how
--
how
do
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
are
the
two
letters,
98
(a)?
what
are
the
two
letters?
what
are
they?
are
they
any
of
the
seven
that
have
been
mentioned?
