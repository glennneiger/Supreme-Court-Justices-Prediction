mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
try
to
clear
up
a
few
things
before
getting
into
my
main
argument.
in
regard
to
the
question
about
whether
or
not
a
search
warrant
could
have
been
issued
without
revealing
the
affidavit
that
the
search
warrant
was
based
upon,
the
law,
of
course,
would
give
little
value
to
the
fourth
amendment
if
you
could
swear
out
the
warrant
and
then
hide
what
affidavits
were
in
support
--
support
of.
now,
you
have
to
reveal
to
the
person
interested
in
the
search,
the
affidavit,
you
have
to
serve
it
on
and
this
is
exactly
what
was
done
when
--
in
regard
to
one
of
these
warrants
in
this
case.
it
was
not
revealed
to
the
public,
it
was
sealed
against
the
public
examination.
but
the
party
himself
was
given
an
opportunity
to
see
whether
there
was
any
legal
basis
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
that
time
the
warrant
is
served
upon.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
recited
in
this
--
on
261.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
page
261
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
assist
us
later.
this
is
the
one
in
regard
to
the
(.
but
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
left
at
the
place
of
the
search.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
this
is
a
different
--
different
case.
yes,
this
is
a
later
search
and
the
search
warrant
was
served
on
him
by
registered
mail
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
if
you
would
try
to
get
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
informed
that
the
--
the
warrant
and
the
return
is
served
on
him.
the
affidavit
is
available
to
him
at
any
time
upon
motion.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
that
--
that
would
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
amendment
so
that
if
we
would
try
to
get
the
evidence
in
this
case,
which
i
don't
think
the
--
the
facts
bear
that
inference
out
--
but
if
we
try
to
get
it
by
that
kind
of
a
procedure,
it
would
readily
be
available
to
abel,
this
chief
of
the
espionage
apparatus.
the
fact
that
hayhanen
had
been
willing
to
testify
defected
and
the
reason
hayhanen
was
unwilling
to
testify
was
that
he
had
family
in
soviet
russia,
that
he
was
fearful
of
being
injured
or
disappeared.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
did
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
my
impression
that
the
probable
cause
would
require
the
--
at
least
the
revelation
to
the
f.b.i.
agent
of
that
information
so
that
he
could
swear
to
the
fact
that
it
had
been
given
to
him
directly.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
whatever
he
disclosed
would
have
revealed
who
the
--
the
only
informant
could
have
been
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
the
various
activities
of
the
apparatus
were
such
as
revealed
by
this
showing
in
the
various
drops
that
they
had
and
the
containers
they
used
and
the
means
of
communication
they
had,
that
all
abel
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
count
out
the
people
that
were
not
involved,
that
he
knew
couldn't
have
given
the
information
and
he
would
readily
come
back
to
hayhanen
as
the
only
source.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
but
in
this
case,
it
was
also
clear
to
the
department
--
and
i
concede
of
course
that
the
attorney
general
is
the
head
of
the
department
of
justice.
that
the
f.b.i.
and
the
i.n.s.
are
not
watertight
compartments,
that
they
are
part
of
the
same
department
and
the
attorney
general
is
responsible
for
their
respective
acts.
and
so
--
and
i
think
they
also,
by
law
and
implication
have
a
duty
to
cooperate
with
each
other
in
seeing
that
criminal
action
is
punished
insofar
as
they
can
in
accordance
with
law.
now,
in
this
case,
they
carefully
examined
the
evidence.
they
thought,
as
counsel
has
conceded
that
there
was
ample
evidence
to
present
this
for
an
indictment
for
a
criminal
conspiracy
or
espionage.
but
the
--
the
effecting
witness
that
was
the
key
to
the
whole
thing
was
unwilling
to
testify.
he
was
a
coconspirator,
by
admission,
and
he
could've
fallen
back
upon
the
fifth
amendment
as
he
threatened
to
do
to
--
so
that
his
testimony
could
not
have
been
obtained
in
court.
and
all
of
the
other
material
that
they
had
was
corroborated,
but
was
not
a
descriptive
and
sufficient
proof
in
the
opinion
of
the
department
to
be
able
to
convict
this
man
for
espionage
or
conspiracy
to
commit
espionage.
so
at
that
point,
it
was
a
question
of
what
could
be
done,
and
i
contend
on
behalf
of
the
government,
without
any
hesitation
that
they
didn't
have
to
sit
back
and
say,
“here's
the
man
as
he'd
been
in
this
country
illegally
for
nine
years,
we
can't
get
him
on
the
charge
of
espionage
because
of
this
defector's
unwillingness
to
testify.
therefore,
we'll
do
nothing.”
i
think
they
had
a
right
to
try
to
get
that
man
deported
from
the
united
states
and
not
let
him
hurt
the
country
anymore.
and
they
proceeded
to
act
in
that
regard.
now,
their
testimony
is
--
is
this
is
the
man's
own
testimony
in
this
case
at
mcallen,
texas
that
he
was
in
this
country
illegally,
he
was
a
citizen
of
soviet
russia,
he
gave
his
name
and
that
he
came
illegally
through
the
canadian
border
at
an
unknown
point.so
all
of
the
elements
for
deportation
were
proved
by
his
own
statements
within
three
days
after
the
date
he
was
taken
down.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
also
did.
but
i
take
the
position
on
behalf
of
the
government.
i
maybe
wrong,
but
i
take
it.
but
the
government
has
the
right
to
choose
between
the
various
opportunities
for
prosecution
or
action
that
it
has.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
attorney
general.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
that's
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
less
than
a
year,
if
i
recall.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
so,
but
i
wouldn't
--
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
to
prosecute
in
that
regard.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
he's
convicted
of
this
conspiracy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
it
was
held
and
he
was
ordered
deported
before
he
was
indicted
under
the
espionage
charges.
now,
at
that
point,
the
liaison
man
for
the
f.b.i.
went
to
mr.
noto,
who
was
the
head
of
special
investigations
for
the
i.n.s.,
and
told
him
this
information
that
he
had.
and
that
here
was
a
man
whom
they
had
evidence,
believed
is
guilty
of
espionage
on
behalf
of
the
soviet
union
and
he's
also
illegally
was
in
the
country
and
has
been
using
fictitious
birth
certificates
and
other
information
to
remain
here
and
to
conceal
his
identity.
and
then
mr.
noto
went
over
to
the
f.b.i.,
talked
with
them
further
and
said
he
would
decide
himself
whether
or
not
he
would
act
to
bring
a
deportation
proceeding.
he
went
and
talked
to
general
(inaudible)
and
told
him
and
said
he
thought
he
had
enough,
but
he
was
going
to
talk
to
the
f.b.i.
further
and
see
what
further
material
they
had.
he
did
that
on
the
subsequent
date
and
then
told
them
that
he
felt
that
there
was
enough
and
instructed
his
immediate
--
the
man
immediate
below
him
to
prepare
the
warrant
and
the
order
to
show
cause
and
to
go
up
the
next
day
and
serve
upon
the
defendant.
and
at
that
time,
these
men,
when
they
went
to
new
york,
were
instructed
to
see
the
acting
director
of
the
immigration
service
there
and
to
--
to
check
with
the
f.b.i.
in
new
york
before
serving
this
--
as
to
the
identity
and
locating
the
man.
so
they
proceeded
to
do
that.
they
satisfied
murff,
the
acting
director,
that
they
did
have
reasonable
cause
believing
this
man
was
--
was
deportable
and
they
asked
him
to
sign
the
order
to
show
cause
and
this
administrative
warrant.
now,
there's
no
question
but
--
about
the
statute.
it
doesn't
provide
for
any
judicial
hearing
on
--
in
regard
to
anything
like
that.
it
never
has
for
all
the
years
it's
been
used
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
there's
no
provision
for
it
as
to
the
order
to
show
cause.
but
the
statute
was
complied
with.
there
isn't
any
contention
in
this
case
that
the
statute
was
not
complied
with
in
regard
to
both
the
order
to
show
cause
and
the
warrant.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
sometime
after
the
--
the
search
and
seizure
that
july
20th
is
the
date
i'm
given
by
counsel,
mr.
maroney.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
evidence
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
august
6th
and
7th
and
the
search
warrant
for
going
into
his
studio
was
on
the
28th
of
june.
and
it
was
the
21st
that
the
search
in
question
here
was
involved.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
they
will.
now,
the
decision
--
the
decision
as
to
the
deportation
was
entirely
made
by
the
immigration
service
and
there
was
no
agreement
that
the
warrant
would
not
be
served
between
the
f.b.i.
and
the
immigration
service.
there
was
a
request
when
they
got
to
new
york
that
they
--
that
the
immigration
service,
before
serving
the
warrant,
permit
the
f.b.i.
to
interrogate
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
and
see
if
he
would
cooperate.
and
the
record
is
--
was
going
into
a
great
length
by
counsel
here
for
petitioner
as
to
what
cooperate
meant
and
it
was
very
clear
in
the
record
and
recited
by
both
courts
below
on
their
finding
for
good
--
that
there
was
good
faith
that
cooperation
was
cooperating
and
answering
the
questions
that
were
put
to
him.
he
answered
some
of
them.
he
refused
to
answer
others
and
it
was
soon
clear
after
some
15,
20
minutes
that
he
would
not
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
--
in
trying
to
answer
the
last
inquiry
from
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
--
the
question
was
in
regard
to
interviews
with
mr.
hayhanen
and
when
he
might
have
been
indicated
his
willingness
for
the
first
time
to
testify
as
i
understood
the
question.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
first
time
that
there
was
any
indication
that
he
was
willing
to
testify
in
july
21st
of
that
same
year,
1957,
they
interviewed
him
again
after
the
interviews
on
the
18th
and
19th
of
june
in
which
he
refused.
on
july
11th,
the
first
time
following
june
18th
and
19th,
he
continued
to
refuse
to
be
willing
to
testify
and
then
he
was
interviewed
from
time
to
time
up
to
the
21st
when
he
did
indicate
his
willingness
to
--
to
testify.
he
was
then
--
he
was
then
presented
to
the
grand
jury
as
of
the
5th
and
6th
and
the
indictment
was
returned
on
the
7th
of
august.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
an
inquiry
was
made
by
justice
stewart
in
regard
to
prosecution
for
illegal
entry,
and
there
is
a
statute
providing
that
that
is
a
misdemeanor,
but
the
statute
is
--
has
a
five-year
limitation.
the
evidence
is
that
this
man
entered
the
country
back
in
1949,
according
to
his
own
testimony.
we
thought
perhaps
it
might
have
been
1948.
we
checked
it
back
through
and
found
from
a
manifest
that
he
did
enter
under
the
name
he
gave
in
1949
and
so,
that
statute
would
have
run.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
fact
that
he
refused
to
report
to
the
attorney
general's
continued
offense.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
probably
could
be.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[laughs]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
a
misdemeanor
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
had
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
would
be
open,
but
we
would
have
to
have
the
testimony
of
hayhanen
to
establish
that
misdemeanor
and
convict
him
under
it.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
latham
hotel
was
entered
for
the
arrest
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
there
were
--
there
was
probable
cause
although
we
didn't
have
--
we
couldn't
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
hayhanen
for
the
trial
and
therefore,
we
felt
we
had
no
chance
to
convict.
nevertheless,
there
was
probable
cause
on
the
violation
of
the
statute
in
regard
to
the
misdemeanor
for
not
reporting
to
the
attorney
general.
there
was
probable
cause
with
--
that's
been
conceded
here
in
regard
to
the
violations
of
the
conspiracy
to
commit
espionage.
there
was
probable
cause
in
regard
to
the
right
of
deportation.
and
if
the
statute
of
limitations
hadn't
run,
there
was
probable
cause
in
regard
to
the
illegal
entry,
all
of
those
at
the
time
of
the
entry
into
the
hotel
latham.
before
closing
last
night,
i
related
the
evidence
in
regard
to
the
immigration
service
determining
that
this
man
should
be
deported.
the
lower
court
found
that
the
immigration
service
did
make
that
decision
and
that
the
f.b.i.did
not
make
it.
the
lower
court
also
found
that
the
good
faith
of
the
government
and
the
immigration
service
throughout
in
this
proceeding
of
trying
to
deport
this
man,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
after
reviewing
the
evidence
and
the
position
of
the
government
that
in
light
of
that,
unless,
there
is
an
error
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
should
be
accepted
in
this
court
and
a
matter
of
good
faith
is
peculiarly
a
--
a
question
of
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
appearing
before
the
court
and
therefore,
it
is
a
matter
that
the
court
--
this
court
should
leave
unless
there
is
an
error
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
keeping
in
mind
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
highest
that
it
shows
was
that
there
was
the
information
--
the
examination
of
it
by
the
internal
security
division.
and
they
concluded
that
without
hayhanen's
testimony,
they
could
not
prove
the
case
in
a
trial
under
an
indictment.
then
it
went
to
general
swing,
the
commissioner
of
immigration
service,
in
that
the
probable
cause
information
for
a
warrant
for
deportation
was
related
to
him,
but
the
evidence
is
that
mr.
noto,
who
is
in
charge
of
special
investigations
for
immigration
service,
was
the
one
who
made
the
decision
to
deport
and
to
issue
the
warrant
and
he
had
the
authority
under
the
regulations.
he
did
direct
that
the
warrant
be
prepared
and
issued
and
that
the
order
to
show
cause
be
prepared
and
issued.
so,
that
the
problem
of
the
department
had
at
that
time
was
that
here
was
a
man
who
has
many
question,
who
was
a
colonel
in
the
espionage
apparatus,
one
--
the
highest
man
we've
ever
located
in
this
country,
that
had
been
working
in
this
country
in
that
service
for
a
period
of
eight
or
nine
years
at
this
time.
we
knew
that
he
had
been
active.
we
had
all
these
evidence
to
the
fact
of
his
activity
in
this
espionage
work
during
this
period
and
corroborating
evidence.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
in
--
in
that
respect.
i
think
that
the
--
the
inference
can
be
drawn
that
it
was
concluded
that
internal
security
division
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
couldn't
prosecute
because
without
hayhanen,
and
therefore,
the
question
was,
“what
could
be
done
to
stop
this
man
from
continuing
as
an
espionage
agent
working
in
this
country?”
and
that
the
best
thing
left
was
to
deport
him.
at
least
he
couldn't
keep
on
working
to
try
to
obtain
and
divulge
the
securities
about
the
internal
security
of
this
country
and
its
defense.
and
so
i
think
that
it's
apparent
from
the
record
and
both
courts
concluded
that
that
was
the
purpose
that
they
felt
they
couldn't
prove
the
others,
although
they
had
probable
cause
and
grounds
for
an
arrest,
they
--
they
couldn't
go
in
the
court
and
prove
it
and
therefore,
they
want
to
stop
this
man
from
continuing
to
operate
on
the
country
as
an
espionage
agent.
so
they
proceeded
this
other
way
that
the
statutes
give
the
power
to
the
attorney
general
to
act,
and
he
proceeded
to
do
it
and
act
in
good
faith.
and
then
they
came
upon
this
additional
evidence,
which
was
not
necessary
if
they
had
hayhanen,
what
was
cumulated.
no
question
about
it
in
regard
to
the
espionage
matter.
and
it's
a
question
of
whether
under
the
decisions
they
had
to
pass
that
up
or
whether
they
could
take
it
as
a
part
of
a
proper
search
and
seizure
and
--
and
actually
the
deportation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
he
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
not
shown.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
harris
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
harris
case
does
speak
of
good
faith
and
the
fact
that
there
was
good
faith
in
the
search
and
seizure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
there's
also
a
claim
here
that
we
didn't
really
want
to
deport
this
man,
that
we
were
just
using
it
as
a
subterfuge
or
device,
and
that
therefore,
by
such
a
device,
we
couldn't
go
around
and
collect
evidence
in
a
search
and
seizure
by
that
means.
and
they
compared
it
with
a
case
where
the
man
slipped
into
the
office
of
a
man
on
the
representation
we're
just
making
a
visit.
you
recall
(inaudible)
case.
and
in
that
case,
he
then
proceeded
to
make
a
search
and
seizure
in
a
clumsy
manner
after
he'd
gotten
in
that
way.
the
court
said
that
was
not
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure
in
accordance
with
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that's
the
effort
here
to
try
to
make
it
appear
to
be
a
subterfuge
and
not
a
valid
deportation
proceeding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
it
was
in
a
bad
faith
and
a
subterfuge,
then
you
don't
reach
the
basic
question,
i
think,
that
you're
directing
to
of
whether
or
not
it's
proper
to
have
a
search
and
seizure
under
a
deportation
warrant
in
any
event
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
or
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
proceeding
to
that,
it
seems
to
us
in
examining
the
cases
the
question
is
under
the
amendment,
what
is
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure?
because
that's
what
the
amendment
says
and
that's
what
this
court
had
said.
and
when
you
get
the
latham
hotel,
the
search
and
the
seizure
that's
involved
in
the
first
part,
and
i'll
deal
with
the
latter
--
with
the
next
step
a
little
later,
was
by
the
immigration
service
and
after
they
asked
for
this
hearing
as
to
cooperation
and
they
got
pass
that
and
they
got
no
cooperation,
then
the
immigration
service
proceeded
to
make
themselves
known
and
that
--
and
present
their
credentials.
they
asked
the
man
what
his
name
was.
and
he
said
it
was
martin
collins,
which
was
one
of
the
names
on
the
--
was
the
name
on
one
of
the
fraudulent
birth
certificates
that
he
had
that
was
discovered
in
the
search.
they
then
proceeded,
he
was
not
dressed,
and
they
told
him
to
get
dressed.
they
presented
their
arrest
warrant
and
their
order
to
show
cause
and
he
receded
the
order
to
show
cause.
they
then
asked
him
what
clothes
he
want
to
take,
what
he
--
what
--
what
he
want
to
wear
first,
and
they
searched
the
clothes
he
was
going
to
wear
as
to
weapons
and
evidence
of
nationality
or
alienage.
and
then
they
proceeded
to
ask
him
what
he
wanted
to
do
about
its
things.
did
he
want
to
take
all
his
belongings
with
him?
and
he
said
he
did
except
for
certain
reservations.
and
then
they
started
it
from
a
job
of
packing
up.
now,
the
only
reason
that
you
allow,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
cases,
the
man
to
be
searched
with
regard
to
weapons
and
anything
that
he
might
make
an
escape
with
is
to
protect
the
officers
in
carrying
out
their
duty
of
serving
the
warrant.
and
certainly
that
is
necessary
if
you
assume
that
a
man
has
to
be
taken
into
custody
for
deportation,
and
certainly,
he
has
to
be
taken
into
custody
if
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
protection
of
the
country,
which
this
certainly
was
within
espionage
agent.
all
right.
when
you
--
when
they
examined
him
with
regard
to
weapons
and
means
of
escape
then
the
cases
have
held
that
if
you
run
across
evidence
of
the
fruits
of
the
transaction,
illegal
transaction,
he's
got
some
money
on
him,
a
robbery
or
anything
like
that,
you
can
take
that.
if
he's
got
the
means
of
committing
other
crimes,
you
can
take
that.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
none
of
them
on
this
person.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
tried
to
slip
it
up
the
sleeve
after
he
got
dressed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
that
got
on
later.
he
was
--
he
was
not
even
dressed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
later.
yes,
by
the
f.b.i.
after
he'd
given
up
the
room.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes.
they
were
taken
from
the
room
in
the
process
of
packing
up
his
belongings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
he
--
he
said
he
wanted
to
take
his
belongings
with
him.
and
they
helped
him
pack.
and
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
it's
unreasonable
not
to
permit
them
to
go
through
these
various
belongings
and
see
whether
he
had
any
weapons
or
means
of
escape
or
any
of
the
other
contraband
or
any
other
unlawful
means.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
room
was
only
8
by
12.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
some
of
them
were.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
immigration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
immigration
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
those
were
in
his
belongings
that
were
being
packed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
isn't
clear.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
isn't
clear
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
from
the
evidence.
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
immigration
agent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
after
he'd
given
up
the
room
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
checked
out
and
they
got
a
consent
from
the
hotel
to
examine
the
room
at
night.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
on
different
grounds.
the
f.b.i.
search,
it
seems
to
us,
is
clearly
after
an
abandonment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
wastepaper.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
he'd
thrown
those
in
the
wastebasket.
and
we
thought
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
other
two
categories
are
in
the
ground
that
they
were
helping
him
pack
and
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
look
through
the
things
that
they
pack
before
they
gave
him
to
him
so
that
he
could
do
them
any
harm
or
use
them
if
they
were
in
violation
of
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
they
would
be
a
means
by
which
he
could
maintain
his
--
his
fictitious
identity
as
he
claimed
he
was
martin
collins
here.
he
also
used
the
name
goldfus
at
his
studio.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
that
he
was
trying
to
slip
up
his
arm
and
was
evidence,
clear
evidence
of
espionage.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
so
it
was
a
means
of
committing
a
crime
and
the
courts
held
that
you
don't
have
to
pass
up
a
material
of
that
kind,
that
you
can
take
it
if
you
run
across
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
--
we
think
there's
no
question
of
what
--
there
is
grounds
for
an
arrest,
but
he's
criminal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
urged
before
the
court
the
administrative
warrant
each
time
and
its
question
whether
the
fact
that
there
was
grounds
for
arrest
otherwise
are
sufficient
under
the
--
the
law
or
not.
they
are,
in
some
of
the
cases
the
court
has
handed
down
and
you
might
not
be
willing
to
recognize
it
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
take
the
position
that
the
immigration
warrant
was
a
justification
of
warrant.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
at
all
times,
there
was
no
question
of
what
--
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
would
get
--
would
get
him
to
testify
for
an
espionage
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
not
exactly
because
if
we
could
have
gotten
a
--
an
espionage
case
against
them,
we
certainly
wouldn't
have
sought
an
immigration
--
a
deportation
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
--
it
was
if
we
can
get
hayhanen
to
testify,
but
we
couldn't
at
that
time
and
so,
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
yes,
it
had.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
had
been
in
a
sense
that
they
had
concluded
that
they
couldn't
get
hayhanen
to
testify
and
the
best
thing
to
do
is
deport
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
think
it
would
have,
but
he
was
very
remote
that
could
happen
with
such
a
skilled
person.
and
it's
--
they
didn't
anticipate
they
could
get
the
independent
evidence
that
would
be
sufficient
for
that
purpose.
they
always
had
plenty
and
more
than
enough
if
hayhanen
would
testify,
but
this
man
was
a
--
a
very
skilled
operator
and
it
was
not
expecting
that
he
would
leave
around
anything.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
i
--
that
was
my
answer,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
says
there
may
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
may
not
be
unreasonable
search
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
court
may
reexamine
harris
and
decide
that
a
warrant
is
necessary
if
there's
time
to
secure,
and
we
don't
claim
that
there
was
not
time
to
secure
it
in
this
matter
because
there
was,
but
we
weren't
trying
to
search
for
anything
in
this
case.
we
were
trying
to
deal
with
a
very
serious
problem
of
an
espionage
agent
and
trying
to
take
care
of
it
since
we
couldn't
have
the
witness
by
deporting
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
record
on
that
is
the
claim
of
the
petitioner
himself,
his
affidavit.
he
never
did
take
the
stand
in
this
matter
in
support
of
that.
there's
no
other
evidence,
all
the
other
evidence
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
think
it
--
they
were
accumulated
and
the
other
evidence
were
so
overwhelming
that
they
would
not
be
controlling
in
the
case,
but
the
code
book
is
an
important
evidence
on
espionage
in
identifying
abel
with
us.
and
certainly
the
code
message
was.
so
those
two
items
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they've
been
used
in
the
court
as
--
tacitly
recognizable
that
give
her
70
years
or
more.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they've
--
they've
always
been
accompanied
by
a
search
to
be
sure
they
wouldn't
kill
the
man
that
was
trying
to
serve
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
also
the
surroundings
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
otherwise,
they'd
be
leaving
themselves
open
to
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
standard
practice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
difference
that
there
was
in
this
case
that
i
think
there
might
not
be
in
all
cases
was
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
he
wanted
to
take
his
belongings
because
he
was
in
the
hotel
room
and
he
said
he
did.
and
so
that
would
necessitate
the
examination
of
those
belongings
to
see
if
there
was
any
weapons
or
anything
of
that
kind
in
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
an
affidavit
by
mr.
farley
of
the
immigration
service
on
page
68
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
68.
and
then
if
you
go
down
to
the
second
full
paragraph,
the
last
sentence,
this
is
customary
practice
after
he's
related
the
search
and
all,
when
aliens
are
arrested
by
immigration
and
naturalization
service
officials
on
charges
similar
to
those
which
led
to
this
arrest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
only
maximum
security
point
that
the
immigration
service
had.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
new
york,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
was
the
24th,
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
10
days
later.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
it
wasn't
already
waiting,
they
certainly
plan
for
it,
i'm
sure.
and
he
went
to
that
hearing.
he's
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
objection
was
made.
and
he
then
admitted
that
he
was
illegally
in
the
country,
that
he
come
across
canada
and
--
and
the
whole
case
was
admitted
right
there
in
regard
to
deportation.
he
was
already
deported.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice,
the
(inaudible)
has
been
changed
in
recent
years.
we've
given
that
up.
but
if
it
doesn't
involve
security,
they
are
provided
in
--
now
in
hotel
rooms
or
other
divisions
in
the
--
in
the
area
there
in
new
york.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
the
statute
gives
a
commission
of
the
discretion.
in
many
of
the
cases,
they're
not
retaining
custody
at
all,
but
this
was
one
where
they
didn't
want
him
to
operate
another
day,
another
moment
on
this
espionage
operation
that
they
could
help.
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
trying
to
deport
him,
it
was
to
get
him
so
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
operate
anymore.
and
the
only
place
they
had
was
this
one
at
mcallen,
texas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
rabinowitz
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seems
to
me
in
rabinowitz,
you
express
the
overrule
of
the
trupiano
case
in
--
in
which
there
was
a
requirement
if
there
was
time
to
get
the
search
warrant
and
you
expressly
overrule
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
--
in
this
case
you
--
we
must
look
at
the
fact
that
this
wasn't
done
for
the
purpose
of
getting
any
search
or
seizure
at
all.
that
isn't
what
they
went
there
for.
they
were
going
to
deport
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
the
--
the
discovery,
the
search
and
the
seizure
were
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
it
was
a
lawful
entry
and
lawful
action,
and
so
the
search
and
seizure
were
lawfully.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
--
all
of
the
reasons
for
applying
those
principles
in
the
criminal
cases
are
here
in
regard
to
this
deportation
case.
and
so
we
say
that
if
a
person
being
prosecuted
for
a
crime
would
not
be
this
--
be
barred
from
such
a
search
and
seizure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
this
would
satisfy
all
the
requirements
of
harris
or
rabinowitz
in
that
event.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
agree
with
your
last
statement
but
i
say
that
if
it
was
a
criminal
proceeding
as
distinguished
from
one
for
deportation,
it
would
come
within
all
standards
and
requirements
of
harris
and
rabinowitz.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
question
that
justice
brennan
asked
me,
and
i
said
i
think
that's
true
but
i
don't
think
we
argued
that
before
in
the
other
two
courts
and
so
the
court
--
unless
they
will
let
us
argue
that
here
the
first
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
would
argue
that
the
arrest
was
legal
in
regard
to
the
criminal
matters.
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
officers
to
be
there
but
i'm
arguing,
i
want
to
clearly
understood
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
and
it
was
not
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
to
sustain.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
may
not
be
willing
to
grant
it
to
me
but
i'm
arguing
it
anyway
on
both
grounds
and
i
think
they're
both
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
answer
it
that
way
and
i
also
add
that
it
was
a
lawful
--
there
was
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
because
of
conspiracy
to
commit
espionage
and
for
violation
of
the
statute
about
reporting
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
said
we
didn't
argue
before
the
other
two
courts
on
any
other
ground.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
do
think
that
there's
adequate
ground
here.
there
was
probable
cause
for
arrest
for
the
criminal
matters
that
i
have
described.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
bothers
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
--
yes.
but
i
still
want
you
to
consider
it,
if
you
will.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
it's
all
there
and
the
facts
were
all
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
admitted.
it's
clear
in
the
record
and
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
would
affect
the
search
or
the
seizure.
that
would
affect
whether
or
not
the
due
process
from
then
on.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
we
had
done
that,
you
would
say
it
was
a
mere
subterfuge
or
device
to
get
the
evidence
for
that
purpose
instead
of
for
purposes
of
deportation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
we
had
gone
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
claimed
that
it
was
an
arrest
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
all
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
there's
probable
cause,
there
is
--
the
question
is
whether
the
officers
are
lawfully
there.
now,
if
there's
probable
cause,
they
are
lawfully
there
in
--
in
order
to
make
an
arrest
and
the
rest
of
it,
the
search
and
seizure
follows
just
like
day
after
night.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
the
probable
cause
is
there
as
admitted
here
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
doesn't
disappear.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that's
the
justification
for
the
search
and
seizure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
have
argued
throughout.
and
the
department
would
argue
in
the
lower
courts
that
there
was
probable
cause
in
regard
at
least
two
offenses,
criminal
offences,
and
there
was
ample
ground
for
search
and
seizure
at
all
times.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
rely
on
both
by
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
we
did
have
one.
that
is
the
fact.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
they
could
--
they
wouldn't
issue
the
warrant
but
the
warrant
was
issued
under
the
statute.
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
it
was
in
regard
to
a
crime?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
wouldn't
have
to
have
the
--
a
warrant.
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
man
right
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
a
--
a
crime
was
being
committed
right
then.
he
was
not
reporting
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
the
--
the
--
there
are
cases
by
the
court
that
if
there
are
acts
in
their
presence
that
amount
to
a
commission
of
a
crime
that
that's
probable
cause.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
was
at
that
time
claimed
to
be
martin
collins
under
a
fraudulent
birth
certificate
in
their
presence
and
that
was
a
--
a
violation
of
the
statutes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
to
dilemma
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
no.
i
think
there
is
a
different
kind
of
a
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
you
have
a
--
a
crime
involves
punishment.
this
court
has
held
that
deportation
does
not
involve
punishment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
--
rest
in
that
sense,
although,
it's
taking
a
person
in
custody
in
order
to
carry
out
the
deportation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
our
argument
is
that
you
shouldn't
certainly
impose
a
more
stricter
rule
on
that
kind
of
a
warrant
and
an
arrest
where
they
come
in
lawfully
under
such
in
a
warrant
than
you
do
in
a
criminal
case
and
therefore,
this
at
least
complies
with
all
of
the
court's
requirements
in
harris
and
rabinowitz
for
--
if
this
was
a
criminal
procedure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
same
--
same
factors
for
the
search
and
seizure
are
involved
in
that
kind
of
an
arrest
that
is
protection
of
the
man
making
the
arrest
that
are
involved
in
a
criminal
arrest.
and
so
we
take
the
position
that
you
should
not
apply
a
stricter
rule
to
that
kind
of
arrest
than
you
do
to
the
other.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
recognize
that
he
has
to
be
taken
into
custody
in
order
to
deport
him
like
the
court
has
a
number
of
times
in
different
cases,
then
you
have
to
--
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
follow
out
just
like
you
have
in
the
criminal
cases
that
there
has
to
be
some
search,
at
least
to
this
person,
so
that
they
don't
kill
the
officer
that's
making
the
arrest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
but
i
don't
want
you
to
misunderstand
me.
i
will
--
i
am
the
warrant
of
the
immigration
service
and
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
which
is
an
authorization
to
take
possession
of
this
man,
take
him
into
custody.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
been
done
for
great
many
years
when
the
court
has
tacitly
at
least
in
the
carlson
case
recognized.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
admit
that
the
--
the
arrest
was
proper.
it
was
conceded
throughout
the
--
the
lower
courts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
still
less
than
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
that
the
record
so
sustains
and
the
record
was
made
by
the
petitioner,
we're
calling
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
testimony
was
exhausted
on
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
was
claiming
to
--
trying
to
maintain
a
fictitious
identify
and
was
not
--
at
that
time
had
not
reported
and
was
not
reporting
at
the
moment
his
location
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
he
also
stated
that
his
name
was
martin
collins.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
evidence
of
the
espionage.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
while
it's
pressuring
the
minds
of
the
court
for
the
argument
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i'd
like
to
deal
just
for
a
moment,
with
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
issue
is
properly
before
the
court
and
later
i
would
like
to
develop
that
at
length,
but
since
it's
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
the
evidence
on
that
question
and
there's
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
issue
that
i
think
is
not
properly
before
the
court,
is
whether
or
not
the
arrest,
under
the
administrative
warrant
was
legally
valid
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
for
the
purpose
of
taking
him
into
custody
and
incidents
in
relation
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
want
to
claim
too
much
in
that
regard
because
i
think
he
was
very
specific
about
saying
that
he
thought
the
arrest
was
legal
and
they
were
not
attacking
the
arrest.
there
are
problems
as
to
how
far
that
carries
you
in
the
case
that
i
think
are
involved
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
way
i
would
construe
his
remarks
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
i
think
in
--
involved
in
that
position
is
the
problem
that
he
assumes
that
evidence
once
legally
obtained
or
instruments
of
a
crime,
or
a
contraband,
or
--
or
weapons
that
might
be
used
for
escape,
once
they're
legally
obtained
in
any
kind
of
a
legal
proceeding,
are
not
available
for
any
kind
of
a
prosecution.
i
don't
think
that's
the
law
and
i'll
try
to
show
the
court
that
its
spoken
on
that's
a
question
a
number
of
times.
but
i
--
i
think
involved
in
the
particular
questions
the
court
has
asked
us
as
to
whether
these
questions
are
properly
before
the
court,
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
--
the
arrest
was
legal.
and
there
are
some
problems
that
i
think
get
in
a
shaded
area
which
he
could
properly
have
before
this
court
and
i
think
they're
in
the
questions
that
he
had
before
the
court
in
the
other
argument.
but
i
want
to
call
attention
to
how
explicit
they
were
about
this
arrest
being
legal
as
they
viewed
it,
so
that
the
--
the
trial
court
tried
to
find
out
that
very
thing
on
page
19
of
the
government's
supplemental
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
first
you
--
despite
what
counsel
says
you
have
to
comport
(inaudible).
you
first
have
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
thinks
it
does.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
want
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
this
way
that
we
--
the
government
takes
the
position
that
if
the
arrest
is
lawful,
then,
there
are
certain
rights
that
the
officers
have
by
reason
of
being
a
lawful
arrest.
and
that
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
permits
certain
things
and
it
permits
a
search
of
the
person,
of
the
person
taken
into
custody
and
for
any
contraband,
for
instruments
of
crime,
for
weapons
or
other
means
of
escape.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes.
that's
our
position.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
i
--
i
think
it
is
important
in
that
concept
--
i'm
not
relying
upon
what
you
said
as
the
court
prior
to
this
time,
for
this
last
statement
of,
yes.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
examine
what
the
nature
of
arrest
is
in
regard
to
whether
you
would
find
properly
that
the
incidence
of
arrest
that
you
recognized
in
criminal
proceedings
should
attach.
and
the
--
the
reason
that
that
has
been
permitted
in
the
past
in
regard
to
arrests,
to
take
into
custody
for
criminal
purposes
or
for
several
things
that
you've
discussed
in
your
opinions
over
the
years.
and
i
think
in
this
particular
area,
there
is
not
much
division
in
the
court
as
to
--
assuming
this
was
a
crime,
an
arrest
for
a
crime,
what
were
the
proper
things
that
could
be
done
in
--
in
regard
to
a
search.
when
you
get
away
from
the
person
or
what's
immediately
in
his
presence,
then
there
is
--
has
been
a
difference
in
the
court
in
some
of
the
opinions
as
to
how
far
you
could
go
in
regard
to
the
search.
and
harris
permitted
it
and
even
so
far
as
four
rooms.
but
the
reason
that
has
been
traditionally
recognized
in
this
court,
as
long
as
this
subject
has
been
discussed
by
the
court's
opinion,
has
been
that
you
can't
expect
a
man
to
be
an
officer
--
to
arrest
a
man
without
giving
him
a
certain
basic
authority
to
protect
himself.
now,
so
you
always
permit,
if
you're
going
to
let
him
take
somebody
in
custody
and
i
say
this
is
always
--
this
is
only
been
applied
to
criminal
cases
up
to
date,
but
i
--
i'm
trying
to
show
that
it
applies
properly
to
an
immigration
case
to
where
you
take
him
into
custody.
because
you
have
the
same
problems
of
whether
the
man
is
going
to
try
to
escape
and
whether
or
not,
if
you
find
on
this
person
and
looking
for
anything
that
he
might
try
to
use
in
--
to
escape,
like
a
physical
weapon
of
that
kind
or
a
blunt
instrument
or
anything
else,
that
knife
that
he
could
use,
then
if
you
find
instrumentalities
of
a
crime,
or
if
you
find
contraband
on
this
person,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
been
generally
in
agreement
over
the
years
that
you
could
take
those
as
a
part.
now,
it's
the
same
problem
that
the
officer
has
in
regard
to
taking
the
man
into
custody
for
immigration
purposes
that
it
is
for
taking
him
into
custody
for
a
crime.
and
that
--
if
you
don't
--
you
can't
accomplish
anything,
if
a
man
is
going
to
be
able
to
keep
his
gun
and
get
away
right
away
or
a
knife
or
other
instruments.
and
it's
always
been
recognized
that
once
that
if
you
can
do
that,
then
if
you
run
across
instruments
out
of
a
--
a
crime
or
contraband,
that
the
government
just
doesn't
have
to
say,
“well;
we
he
won't
pay
any
attention
to
those”
and
has
been
--
been
permitted
to
take
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
if
you
get
in
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
the
general
search,
it's
a
much
more
difficult
problem
than
it
is
if
it's
a
limited
search
under
the
decisions
of
the
court.
although,
i
think
harris
and
rabinowitz
goes
a
great
place
in
regard
to
permitting
a
--
a
general
search.
always,
you
can't
search
for
evidence
so
that's
conceited.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
--
i
will
--
i'll
--
mr.
chief
justice,
we
--
the
government
takes
the
position
that
these
--
every
one
of
these
seven
items
that
are
in
issue
here,
were
instrumentalities
of
crime.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i'll
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
takes
the
position
it
was
a
limited
search.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
also,
if
this
was
an
illegal
arrest,
we
would
concede
that
you
have
no
right
to
search
or
seize.
that
all
of
the
proceeds
from
first
determining
whether
the
parties
or
officers
were
legally
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
clark.
it
was
so
explicitly
asked,
they
were
asked
several
times
when
we
set
it
out
on
page
19
of
our
brief
and
they
said
they
weren't
even
so
far
as
to
say,
we
are
not
contesting
that
at
all,
we
thought
--
we
agree
that
it
was
their
duty
to
arrest
this
man.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
say
by
that
but
they
were
saying
that
there
was
a
--
a
right
to
arrest
and
make
all
the
search
because
they
claimed
the
search
was
in
bad
faith.
that
was
their
basic
claim
in
this
case.
that
even
though
the
arrest
was
legal,
the
government
was
trying
to
get
this
evidence
all
the
time
from
the
beginning
for
the
espionage
case
and
was
not
in
good
faith
in
trying
to
get
this
man
arrested
and
take
whatever
was
properly
a
matter
of
search
in
connection
with
that
purpose.
now,
that
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
clash
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
two
courts
have
decided
this
question
below
in
regard
to
the
good
faith
of
the
matter
and
we've
tried
to
present
that
in
our
last
argument
in
our
briefs
in
great
detail
should
be
a
great
weight
before
this
court.
so,
we
then
--
i'll
followup
later
where
this
issue
was
properly
before
the
court,
but
we
then
turn
to
the
questions
that
the
court
asked
now
as
to
rearguing.
and
bear
that
as
we
understand
it,
the
first
question
is,
was
this
warrant
properly
issued
in
the
first
place?
and
we
think
that
means
whether
or
not,
it
was
properly
issued
under
the
statute
and
was
lawful.
now,
then
whether
or
not
it
was
a
valid
warrant
for
the
arrest
and
further
whether
before
the
search
and
seizure.
i'd
like
to
treat
that
first
as
to
whether
or
not,
it
was
lawful
under
the
statutes.
and
i
think
that
involves
first,
the
assumption
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply,
then
i'll
proceed
next
to
the
fact
that
if
the
fourth
amendment
applied,
we
satisfied
that.
and
last,
the
effect
on
the
search
and
seizure.
now,
the
statute
for
great
many
years,
some
75
years
and
then
you
go
back
to
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
clear
back
to
1798,
provided
for
the
warrant
of
arrest
or
the
right
to
take
into
custody
a
person
who
was
to
be
deported,
to
be
a
matter
of
executive
action
and
has
not
provided
at
anytime
throughout
our
history
for
a
judicial
review
--
or
a
requirement
that
the
warrant
be
issued
by
a
magistrate
as
distinguished
from
the
executive
officer.
now,
the
statute
we
have
set
out
in
--
as
if
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
prior
brief,
not
this
last
supplemental
brief,
provides
explicitly
that
the
attorney
general
shall
have
the
authority
to
issue
such
a
warrant.
and
then
there's
authority
for
the
attorney
general
to
delegate
his
duties
and
there
is
a
provision
in
the
regulations
for
how
that
shall
be
done
and
then
there
are
special
instructions.
and
the
instructions
provide
that
deportation
shall
be
brought
in
a
certain
manner
and
that
it
provides
for
a
requirement
that
the
warrant
shall
be
issued
only
upon
the
--
being
developed,
the
prima
facie
case
or
the
district
director
or
a
deputy
director
to
be
satisfied
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
just
by
a
deportation.
and
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
a
--
the
appendix
to
our
supplemental
brief,
our
last
brief
on
page
52.
and
that's
the
instruction
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
arrest
is
covered
on
page
64.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
of
the
original
brief.
and
that
authorizes
the
taking
into
custody
under
a
warrant
of
arrest,
when
it
appears
necessary
or
desired.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
implied.
i
don't
recall
the
language
after
but
--
but,
i
think
it's
implied
in
connection
with
the
deportations
at
the
commencement
that
if
you
--
mr.
justice
black
on
page
63,
i
think
refers
back
to
the
deportation
procedures.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
supervision
is
directed
because
it's
left
in
the
hands
of
the
district
director
at
that
level
and
presumed
to
be
an
act
with
the
attorney
general.
there
is
no
supervision
of
a
court
or
a
magistrate
involved.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
--
it's
our
argument
that
they
should
be,
because
the
same
problems
are
involved
in
taking
a
person
into
custody
for
this
purpose
and
the
reasons
that
the
courts
have
allowed
such
as
search
and
seizure
in
criminal
cases
pertaining
to
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
in
like
manner.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
relate
it
to
criminal
proceedings,
what
you
--
permit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
is
not
criminal
and
the
court
said
it's
civil.
and
the
government
takes
position
that
there
should
be
greater
latitude
in
the
civil
proceeding
than
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
but
separate
and
apart
from
that,
you
--
and
if
the
court
has
--
the
courts
have
recognized
that
when
a
person
has
to
be
taken
into
custody,
there
are
certain
searches
allowed
in
early
english
times
down
through
the
years
because
of
the
problems
involved
in
taking
them
into
custody.
and
amongst
those
are
--
are
that
you
search
this
person.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
for
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
weapons
and
instruments
that
might
be
used
to
escape
or
to
destroy
the
officer.
you
can
also
search
him
for
instruments
of
criminality
and
contraband.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
these
particular
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
these
particular
evidences
or
these
particular
things
that
were
secured
by
the
search
were
directly
connected
with
crime.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
no.
but
if
--
if
the
officers
properly
on
the
premises,
lawfully
there,
you
don't
say
to
him
if
he
finds
a
body
there
or
some
instruments,
the
tools
of
a
burglar
that
he
can't
take
those
into
his
custody.
it's
always
been.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
know
why
would
--
i
think
that
davis
and
zap
would
hold
that.
i
think
they're
--
they
were
locally
making
an
examination
into
the
records
in
the
one
case
and
they
discovered
these
coupons,
gasoline
coupons,
ration
coupons
and
the
court
held
they
could
lawfully
take
those.
and
in
zap,
you
can
have
the
case
where
they
have
discovered
a
check
and
the
majority
of
the
court
held
that
was
an
instrument
of
the
crime
as
a
majority
of
those
sitting
and
held
that
even
though
that
was
not
in
that
particular
matter,
a
criminal
inquiry
that
the
evidence
of
instrumentality
of
crime
itself
could
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
i
recall,
they
had
a
warrant
in
one
of
the
cases,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
i
agree
with
that
except
that
i
--
whether
the
government
takes
davis
and
zap
and
harris
and
rabinowitz
as
the
law
in
regard
to
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i
--
i
recognized
that,
your
honor,
as
the
difference
in
regards
to
those,
but
i
was
trying
to
take
first
to
the
question
of
search
of
the
person
and
then
the
court
has
in
davis
and
zap
and
harris
and
rabinowitz
recognized
that
that
search
of
a
person
could
be
extended
to
what
was
reasonably
within
his
control.
and
harris
has
gone
so
far
as
to
recognize
in
the
four
rooms
that
he
--
he
had
that
--
those
were
under
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
yes.
the
--
the
same
acts
of
not
reporting
the
address
of
the
petitioner
to
the
attorney
general
was
an
offense
under
the
immigration
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
a
failure
to
report
his
address
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
that
identical
act
without
more
was
--
so
that
the
very
same
thing
that
was
a
deportation
offense
and
for
which
he
was
arrested
was
also
a
misdemeanor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
--
this
position
of
the
government
of
the
four
items
in
regard
to
alien
issue
that
is
the
--
the
fictitious
birth
certificate
about
martin
collins,
this
spurious
birth
certificate
about
goldfus,
the
savings
bankbook
in
the
name
of
goldfus
and
the
vaccination
certificate
that's
the
four
items
were
all
involved
in
his
trying
to
preserve
or
establish
that
he
was
lawfully
within
the
united
states
when
he
wasn't.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
beyond
that,
the
other
three
items,
two
of
them
were
taken
out
of
the
wastebasket
and
thrown
away
by
the
petitioner
before
the
search
ever
occurred.
and
the
other
one,
he
was
slipping
up
his
arm
at
the
time
and
they
caught
him
all
he
was
doing.
and
that
seems
to
us
that
those
are
clear
items,
the
two
that
he
abandoned
the
wastebasket
were
certainly
items
that
the
--
the
officers
could
search
for
and
if
they
got
a
permission
from
the
only
man
that
could
have
any
control
of
it,
which
was
the
hotel
owner
or
the
hotel
manager.
so
those
two
items
were
--
and
they
were
evidence
and
there
was
more
than
evidence.
they
were
instrumentalities
for
carrying
on
the
crime
of
espionage.
one
of
them
was
a
sandpaper
block
that
was
so
made
that
it
could
be
cut
--
it
could
be
opened
up,
it
was
cut
apart
and
it
conceals
some
microfilm
that
revealed
the
time
of
radio
broadcast
that
could
be
received
in
regard
to
espionage
and
the
defense
department
checked
that
and
found
that
there
were
communications
of
the
exact
type
that
was
--
were
contained
in
one
of
these
receptacles
that
was
a
code,
special
code
in
red
and
black
letters
of
five
inches.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
evidence
beyond
that
was
overwhelming
that
they
had
without
these
items.
and
if
they
had
raised
the
question
in
the
manner
that
--
of
objecting
to
the
arrest
and
saying
that
these
items
were
not
admissible
for
that
reason
and
the
court
--
and
the
court
could
then
in
the
--
in
the
lower
court
could
either
have
decided
that
this
kind
of
an
arrest
was
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment
if
it
had
and
if
it
was
--
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
have
not
--
the
right
to
search
and
seize
these
items
because
of
that.
they
could
have
eliminated
--
eliminated
them
and
we
would've
had
overwhelming
proof
against
this
petitioner
of
his
espionage
activities.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
he
was
--
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that's
in
regard
to
the
crime.
well,
that
is
something
that
was
not
done.
but,
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
you
don't
go
back
of
the
point
of
the
search
and
seizure,
but
whatever
--
whatever
wrong
occurred
was
at
that
point
and
the
action
with
that
question
would
be
--
it
would
have
to
be
raised
and
would
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
search
and
seizure
or
the
arrest
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
would
have
to
be
squarely
raised
in
regard
to
that.
now,
he
--
he
could've
made
a
motion
and
say
--
said
that
he
had
not
been
taken
before
a
magistrate.
i
think
the
mitchell
case
would
have
some
bearing
on
that
because
even
though
--
if
you
recall
this
--
the
defendant
or
petitioner
in
--
in
mitchell
was
kept
--
a
period
of
time
as
recognized
is
unlawful,
after
his
confession.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
the
confession
having
occurred
properly
even
though
they
kept
him
--
they
didn't
take
him
to
an
officer
for
a
long
time
later,
the
confession
was
admissible.
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
you'd
have
to
--
compartment
this
case
in
order
to
examine
the
various
steps
and
you
don't
go
back
of
where
the
error
occurred
to
condemn
the
evidence.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
spoken
beyond
four
rooms
so
far
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
--
in
harris,
the
court
found
that
there
was
sufficient
control
to
permit
the
--
a
search
and
seizure
over
the
whole
four
rooms.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you're
going
to
apply
the
fourth
amendment,
if
--
i
would
seem
that
you
have
--
you
want
to
apply
it
so
that
it
permits
the
same
latitude
because
certainly,
this
deportation
case
is
no
worst
than
a
criminal
case
if
you're
going
to
apply
it.
you
--
it
would
be
as
extreme
a
rule
as
the
court
has
to
require
that
they
have
--
they'd
be
there
lawfully
in
order
to
make
the
search.
and
once
they
are,
they
can
exercise
the
search
and
seizure
within
the
area
that
the
--
that
is
within
--
that
is
under
the
control
of
the
petitioner.
now,
under
that
kind
of
an
assumption,
i
think
it's
very
proper
that
with
the
administrative
warrant,
you
wouldn't
apply
any
--
any
worst
rule
than
you
would
if
it
was
a
criminal
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
control
this
case?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
first
--
first,
mr.
justice,
if
the
position
in
harris
was
the
minority
position
and
i
don't
think
that
would
control
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
we
didn't
search
any
four
rooms.
we
searched
those
that
--
the
only
room
that
was
right
there
under
his
control
and
i
think
the
difference
between
the
control
is
very
real,
where
he
had
a
small
hotel
room
like
this
as
the
evidence
shows
and
four
rooms
of
the
house
that
include
a
kitchen,
a
bathroom,
as
well
as
a
living
room
and
a
bedroom.
but
beyond
that,
i
don't
think
that
we
have
a
comparable
situation,
because
what
the
only
items
in
issue
here
were
the
--
these
alienage,
four
items
that
i
referred
to
and
the
three
items,
two
of
which
were
in
the
wastebasket
and
the
one
is
slipping
up
his
sleeve.
now,
that
the
government,
we
think
that
the
wastebasket
that
was
abandoned
was
clearly
outside
of
any
--
of
the
--
the
most
extreme
position.
in
the
harris,
the
other
way,
would
not
affect
in
any
way
our
right
to
take
that.
then
when
we
take
what
was
up
his
sleeve,
we
say
that's
a
special
case.
and
all
the
cases,
if
you're
going
to
let
us
search
at
all
of
his
person
would
permit
an
instrument
of
--
of
criminality
if
you've
taken
out
of
his
sleeve.
then,
when
you
get
to
the
items
of
alienage,
it
isn't
clear
just
what
part
of
his
things
those
were
taken
from.
we
think
that
burden
was
on
the
petitioner
to
show
exactly
where
they
were
taken
in
order
to
be
able
to
say,
“he
couldn't
do
this
or
that.”
but
beyond
that,
we
say
that
the
--
this
man
was
asked,
“are
you
going
to
keep
your
things
here,
in
this
hotel
room,
or
you
--
you
want
to
go?”
he
says,
“i
want
to
take
my
things.”
if
you're
going
to
go
and
i
told
him
where,
they
were
going
to
take
him
and
arrest,
“i
want
to
take
my
things
with
me.”
now,
they
--
they
then
--
and
he
said
he
wanted
to
leave
a
few
things.
he
wouldn't
take
them.
he
was
going
to
throw
them
away.
then
they
proceeded
to
help
him
pack.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
its
--
under
all
of
those
rules
regardless
of
the
dissent
in
harris
and
rabinowitz
in
other
cases
that
its
unreasonable
to
ask
these
officers
to
--
if
they
were
going
to
help
him
to
not
--
when
they
put
--
picked
up
a
piece
of
apparel
or
some
other
thing
and
help
him
put
in
the
suitcase,
it
was
wrapped
around
a
gun
and
say,
“oh,
we
forget
about
that.
maybe
he
can't
get
to
the
suitcase
as
fast
as
we
can
and
we
don't
have
to
--
we
can't
touch
that
and
the
other
things.”
so,
it
seems
to
me,
its
quite
different
when
you
pick
up
these
things
to
move
it
and
by
the
very
nature,
they
have
to
be
picked
up
pretty
much
his
items
and
put
in
the
suitcase
to
see
whether
there's
any
instruments
of
criminality
or
contraband
in
connection
with
him,
than
if
you're
going
around
and
pulling
suit
files
or
if
he
wasn't
going
to
move
from
there,
if
they've
gone
through
all
the
covers
and
search
his
things
and
handled
in
that
matter.
now,
that's
what
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
repeat
what
those
were.one
was
a
fictitious
birth
certificate
in
the
name
of
martin
collins
and
that
was
the
evidence
otherwise
shows
very
clearly
that
the
government
knew
long
before
this
and
these
immigration
officers
knew
that
that
was
one
of
the
aliases
he
used.
another
was
a
spurious
birth
certificate.
one
of
them,
there
was
the
martin
collins,
there
was
someone
in
existence
and
i
think
that
was
when
it's
forged.
the
goldfus
one
was
the
--
for
a
child
that
had
died
and
the
parents
by
very
curious
situation
had
named
the
second
child
by
exactly
the
same
name,
which
he
didn't
know
but
he
developed
this
spurious
in
the
name
of
goldfus
which
was
another
one
of
his
aliases.
and
then
he
had
a
fraudulent
vaccination
certificate
that
he
would
need
in
connection
with
maintaining
his
position
in
the
country.
that
was
in
the
name
of
goldfus
as
i
recall.
and
the
fourth
one
was
a
savings
bank
of
the
east
river
savings
bank,
a
bank
deposit
book
that
was
in
the
name
of
goldfus.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
proceed
at
this
point
briefly
to
call
attention
to
the
procedures
in
instituting
an
immigration
deportation
case.
prior
to
the
1956,
it
was
a
regularly
a
procedure
to
take
every
petitioner
or
person
who
was
to
be
deported
into
custody
and
you
recall
that
the
court
dealt
with
that
a
number
of
times.
i
think
the
last
case
was
in
carlson
against
landon.
now,
i
don't
mean
that
the
--
this
question
of
whether
it
was
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
ever
squarely
raised
before
the
court
and
it
was
not,
but,
if
you
will
recall
that
in
carlson
against
landon,
the
issue
of
bail
was
raised
and
there
was
a
division
in
the
court
and
certainly,
it
was
said
that
it
was
a
civil
proceeding
in
that
case
and
it
was
a
clear
implication
that
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
it
being
a
civil
proceeding
that
it
certainly
would
be
raised
and
the
court
in
–
back,
as
far
as
fong
yue
ting
said
in
--
in
dicta
that
the
constitution
as
to
searches
and
seizures
and
a
number
of
other
things
did
not
apply.
now
i
don't
mean
for
a
moment
that
this
court
cannot
properly
now
examine
that
question
squarely,
because
it
has
not
has
been
before
the
court
squarely
except
now
with
the
caveat
that
we
don't
think
it's
properly
here
now.
but,
it
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
question
that
the
court
can
always
properly
examine
on
its
own
unless,
as
we've
try
to
point
out
there's
some
factors
that
does
result
and
do
result
in
unfairness
in
this
particular
proceeding
to
have
it
raised
at
this
late
date.
but,
i
want
to
deal
with
it
squarely
anyway
and
try
to
show
that
we
--
we
would
satisfy
the
requirements
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
did
apply.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
if
there
was
nothing
about
this
procedure
that
would
require
taking
into
custody
the
way
it
is
done,
then
i
think
the
incidence
to
that
procedure
that
the
courts
have
recognized
that
officers
have
a
right
to
do,
could
not
be
recognized
as
proper
and
legal.
but
taking
into
custody,
as
i
see
it,
for
a
person
who
is
being
deported
is
just
as
--
has
all
of
the
elements
of
an
arrest
for
a
criminal
proceeding
insofar
as
the
problems
dealing
with
trying
to
keep
that
person
in
custody.
and
that's
--
that's
the
reason
that
the
courts
have
recognized
since
the
early
english
cases,
that
once
you
arrest
a
man,
and
you're
going
to
take
him
into
custody,
you
have
to
have
certain
powers
to
go
with
it.
now,
if
you
think
--
are
satisfied
by
our
argument
that
they
are
comparable
and
parallel
in
that
regard,
then
i
think
you
would
say
regardless
of
how
you
characterize
this
particular
proceeding,
civil
or
quasi-civil
or
--
or
criminal,
you
still
have
to
have
the
power
to
do
these,
the
kind
of
searches
to
protect
the
officers
and
maintain
your
custody
that
you
do
for
any
other
kind
of
a
proceeding
where
you
have
to
take
into
custody.
now,
that's
what
we're
trying
to
point
out
in
that
regard.
we
think
that
there's
no
difference
between
the
problem
of
the
officers.
this
is
an
extreme
case
because
i
think
we
could
all
concede
that
a
man
that's
taken
into
custody
that
has
for
a
deportation
offense,
but
is
an
active
spy
for
a
foreign
government
would
do
all
he
could
where
the
penalties
are
so
great
as
they
are
for
that
as
well
as
the
deportation
problem
for
him
to
get
away.
because,
if
he
could
get
over
either
border,
with
the
kind
of
materials
that
he
had
developed
for
himself
to
try
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
not
properly
within
the
country,
he
would
be
protected
against
the
deportation
or
the
--
or
anything
else
that
would
result
from
it.
so,
his
desire
to
do
away
with
the
officer
or
do
anything
he
could
with
any
kind
of
a
weapon
that
he
could
get,
seem
to
me
would
be
just
as
great
as
any
kind
of
a
criminal
that
you
would
pick
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
follows.
i
think
if
the
courts
--
either
court
before
this
or
this
court
was
satisfied
that
that's
all
this
proceeding
was,
that
this
was
just
a
device
or
scheme
by
means
of
which
they
went
in
for
one
purpose
in
order
to
get
evidence
for
another
purpose,
but
then
under
your
holdings,
you'd
have
to
hold
that
the
search
was
improper,
entirely.
so,
he
is
assuming
that
kind
of
a
conclusion
as
a
justification
for
the
legal
conclusion,
but
if
you
assume
it
was
in
good
faith,
and
that
it
was
done
for
the
purposes
of
deportation,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
fits
in
as
a
parallel
to
the
cases
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
where
you
go
in
for
one
purpose
the
mere
fact
that
you
discover
all
kinds
of
criminal
evidence
--
not
evidence
but
instruments
of
criminality
at
the
time
you're
in
there
lawfully,
doesn't
mean
that
the
officer
has
to
walk
away
and
say,
“i'm
not
interested
in
what
anybody
can
do
to
the
united
states
or
in
criminal
way
by
reason
of
these
instruments
--
i
--
i
just
close
my
eyes
to
those
things.”
now,
the
courts
have
said
before
that
if
you
go
there
for
--
in
ordinary
civil
matters
and
you
discover
those
particular
things
that
are
instruments
of
a
crime
or
contraband,
you
don't
have
to
turn
your
back
on
them
and
you
can
pick
them
up,
but,
i
think
his
statement
assumes
that
this
is
done
in
bad
faith
and
if
it
was,
then
i
think
that
your
--
that
harris
would
--
wouldn't
permit
anything
like
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
isn't
any
question
mr.
chief
justice
but
what,
there
was
time
in
this
case
to
get
a
search
warrant.
the
government
would
concede
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
got
what
the
kind
they
want.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
law
doesn't
require
there's
a
difference
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
concede
mr.
chief
justice
that
would
simplify
everything.
we
probably
wouldn't
have
the
--
the
lawsuit
at
least
about
that,
but
if
this
was
a
criminal
case,
in
the
start,
as
i
read
--
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
you
wouldn't
have
to
get
a
warrant
even
if
you
had
time
and
could.
you
see,
that
was
the
issue
in
trupiano
that
the
court
overruled
and
held
that
you
didn't,
even
though
you
could,
have
to
get
it,
if
it
was
a
criminal
case.
now,
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
if
we
--
we
deal
with
that
as
still
being
the
law
of
the
court,
unless
the
court
decides
that
it
wants
to
go
to
some
other
rule,
and
we
shouldn't
have
a
rule
that
applies
to
this
kind
of
a
case
that's
less
of
--
it's
some
kind
of
less
than
a
criminal
case,
but
is
more
strict
than
a
criminal,
is
all
i
say
and
if
this
was
just
an
ordinary
criminal
case,
or
any
kind
of
a
crime,
the
most
extreme
that
you
could
have
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
and
get
a
warrant
to
make
the
search
and
seizure
even
though
you
had
time
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
you
were
properly
there
and
if
the
--
there
is
--
items
were
under
the
control
of
the
--
as
the
court
has
read
it,
of
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
say
--
before
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
concede
there
was
time
at
the
time
they
got
the
administrative
warrant,
before
they
went
there.
now,
after
that,
i
think
everything
points
to
the
fact
that
whatever
was
there
would
have
disappeared.
we
have
proof
that
this
man
tried
to
slip
up
his
sleeves,
and
the
only
purpose
was
concealment,
a
very
important
evidence
of
his
or
instrument
of
his
activity
as
an
espionage
agent.
it
was
communications.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
after
we
had
him
--
had
taken
him
away
under
our
custody,
we
certainly
could
have
controlled
anything
that
he
would
not
--
have
not
been
able
to
conceal.
but
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
nothing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
--
that's
what
it
--
the
court's
position
has
been
at
all
times
that
if
they're
lawfully
there,
up
to
trupiano,
and
in
trupiano
the
court
said,
“if
you
have
time,
you've
got
to
go
out
and
get
it”
and
after
the
--
and
then
the
court
to
expressly
overrule
trupiano,
and
said
that
you
don't
have
to
get
it
if
you
have
--
if
you're
lawfully
there.
and
i
would
think
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
that's
less
than
a
full
criminal
case,
under
the
decisions
of
the
court,
you
wouldn't
expect
the
officers
to
go
out
and
do
that.
now,
i
don't
say
they
--
it
--
it
was
physically
possible
or
couldn't
be
done.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
don't
--
the
government
doesn't
think
that
they
forced
their
way
into
the
room.
they
came
to
the
door,
and
at
that
point,
they
had
more
than
reasonable
cause.
they
had
a
prima
facie
case
which
is
what
is
required
from
immigration
cases,
it's
substantially
more
than
probable
cause
which
is
enough
for
an
arrest
and
at
the
door,
they
didn't
break
the
door
in
at
all.
they
rapped
on
the
door
and
asked
him
if
they
could
come
in
and
he
didn't
invite
them
in
but
they
went
on
in.
now,
there
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
their
construction
of
it
is
pushed
their
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
--
and
went
into
the
room
and
i
--
i
didn't
conceive
of
it
as
being
a
forceful
entry
under
the
decisions
of
the
court.
it
seemed
to
me
that
that's
more
like
your
cases
where
the
door
is
closed
and
they
break
even
though
there
is
a
screen
door
if
you
recall
the
case,
they
broke
the
catch
on
the
door
and
went
on
in
or
they
break
in
the
room
and
so
forth.
and
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
right,
but
if
under
your
decisions,
if
you
have
probable
cause,
you
have
a
right
go
in
and
arrest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
both
--
both
mr.
chief
justice
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
only
rely
on
that
as
far
as
satisfying
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
statute
requires
that
there
be
an
administrative
warrant.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
wouldn't
concede
that
was
an
arrest
at
that
point.
they
hadn't
taken
him
into
custody
at
all.
they
--
the
fbi
people
didn't
at
all
take
him
into
custody,
arrest
him
or
say
that
they
arrested
him
or
purport
to
hold
him
on
anything.
if
you
recall
they
said
to
him,
“are
you
so
and
so?
we
believe
we
know
these
things
about
you”
and
they
made
inquiries
to
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
for
half
an
hour.
now
they
could
do
that
with
anybody
lawfully
unless
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
because
at
--
when
they
got
through,
they
said,
“you're
going
to
be
arrested
before
you
leave
this
room,”
but
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that
was
immediately
the
immigration
people
came
in
and
served
it
on
him
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
the
chief
justice
was
asking
about
the
warrant
i
think
and
we
were
saying
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
said
that
during
this
half
hour,
wasn't
their
arrest.
now,
i
didn't
--
i
don't
conceive
of
that
as
being
an
arrest
of
this
man.
if
he
had
tried
to
leave,
i
think
that
they
would
have
--
the
immigration
people
would
have
picked
him
up
under
their
warrant
right
then
or
that
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
wasn't.
none
of
them
were.
none
of
them
were
involved.
they
were
all
found
and
seized
after
that
event.
and
as
you
recall,
that
that
occurred
because
the
fbi
asked
if
they
could
have
a
time
to
see
if
he
would
cooperate
with
them.
and
they
want
to
discuss
the
matter
with
him.
now,
he
--
there
isn't
any
evidence
that
he
had
any
time
asked
if
he
could
leave
or
whether
he
was
being
restrained
or
anything
of
that
character.
there
is
evidence
although
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
there
was
not.
all
of
the
search
was
after
that
and
there
was
nothing
in
a
way
of
search
while
he
was
down
in
texas,
either
and
in
that
regard,
i
want
to
say
that
--
well,
they
say
that
he
was
kept
incommunicado.
that
is
not
an
accurate
statement
of
what
the
record
shows.
the
record
is
clear
that
he
was
told
at
the
time
that
the
order
to
show
cause
was
served
upon
him
and
that
he
was
taken
into
custody
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer.
he
never
asked
for
a
lawyer
at
anytime
until
three
days
after
he
was
down
in
mcallen,
texas.
and
immediately
upon
his
asking
for
it,
he
was
given
a
telephone
book
and
made
a
communication
and
got
the
lawyer
of
his
selection.
and
that
lawyer
represented
him
in
the
proceeding
from
that
time
on.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
were
none
of
those
things
in
regard
to
anything
that's
in
issue
here.
i
can't
say
clearly
that
there
weren't
--
there
wasn't
some
kind
of
search
of
his
belongings
later
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
think
there
were
none.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
those
are
all
statements
that
he
made
in
--
no
they
were
statements
during
the
hearing
only
represented
by
counsel
and
there
was
no
objection
to
them
at
anytime.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
--
and
when
that
was
introduced
to
the
hearing
there
was
no
objection
to
it
at
the
trial.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
motion
was
much
broader
than
the
seven
items
at
the
time.
and
then,
he
--
during
the
argument
as
we
presented
in
our
first
brief,
he
took
the
seven
items
and
said
those
were
the
ones
he
was
relying
on.
and
the
--
all
of
the
items
that
were
taken
were
offered
back
to
him
except
the
seven
items
at
various
times
but
he
indicated
that
he
had
no
place
to
keep
them
and
at
one
time
and
that
he'd
rather
we
--
the
government
kept
them
until
such
time
as
he
was
able
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
were
never
used
anyway.
the
seven
were
the
only
ones
that
were
--
that
were
involved
that
were
ever
used.
so
that,
the
only
issue
of
law
that
could
be
in
the
case
would
be
the
seven
items
that
were
used
in
the
case
against
him.
i'm
advised
that
all
except
16
of
the
items
were
removed
by
stipulation
by
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
from
the
motion
to
suppress
and
that
the
only
items
that
were
introduced
against
him
were
the
seven
and
those
are
the
only
ones
that
could
involve
any
error
as
far
he
is
concerned.
now,
if
we
were
required
to
meet
the
--
the
requirements
or
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment,
in
regard
to
searches
and
seizures,
then
it's
a
question
of
whether
we
were
lawfully
in
the
room
at
the
time
just
prior
to
the
search
and
that
question
is
determined
by
whether
or
not
we
have
we
had
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
you
have
probable
cause
and
the
most
recent
one
is
draper,
then,
you
have
a
right
to
proceed
from
that
point.
now,
we
had
more
than
probable
cause
at
all
times
for
every
officer
that
had
anything
to
do
with
this
matter,
prior
to
the
time
that
he
came
up
there
to
make
the
arrest.
we
had
a
prima
facie
case
and
that's
the
requirement
of
the
immigration
act
and
as
the
regulations
and
instructions
provide
and
we
had
it
in
this
case
and
this
court
has
said
a
prima
facie
case
is
more
than
probable
cause
because
the
prima
facie
case,
if
not
rebutted,
establishes
the
case
and
probable
cause
is
merely
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
crime
was
committed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice,
but
if
you
had
a
--
and
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
warrant
of
any
kind
for
the
immigration
officers
if
they
are
going
to
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor.
there's
no
provision
about
it.
there's
a
provision
in
regard
to
arresting
for
a
felony
or
for
deportation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
because
the
statute
is
too
explicit
about
requiring
a
warrant
from
the
immigration
officers
and
the
same
is
true
if
we're
going
to
arrest
and
take
into
custody
for
the
purposes
of
deportation.
so,
since
there
is
no
provision
under
the
statute,
you
look
to
what
the
provisions
of
state
law
are
in
regard
to
it
and
in
that
case,
if
the
crime
is
being
committed
in
your
presence,
then
you
have
the
right
to
arrest,
the
officers
in
the
same
position
as
the
position
of
the
citizen.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
in
new
york.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
he's
knocked
on
the
door
and
he
was
let
in
and
the
man
was
then
engaged
in
committing
a
crime,
the
law
would
certainly
permit
him
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know
as
to
that.
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
case.
i
think
that
there
was
involved
in
knocking
on
his
door
the
inquiry
that
the
fbi
wanted
first
to
make
as
to
whether
he
would
cooperate
and
i
think
they
could
ask
that
of
any
person,
a
citizen
or
alien
in
the
country
whether
it's
a
reasonable
inquiry
and
i
don't
see
why
they
couldn't
come
and
if
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
them
he
could
say
so
and
say,
“get
out”
and
they
did
toss
to
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
then
the
door
was
opened
and
the
ins
people
went
in
there
and
this
was
a
continuing
crime
of
not
advising
the
attorney
general
of
where
he
was
under
the
statute,
and
since
it
was
continuing
crime
it
was
being
committed
in
their
presence
and
was
ample
ground
for
them
to
make
the
arrest
and
everything
proceeds
from
that.
they
were
lawfully
there.
so,
if
you
assume
that
a
prima
facie
case
is
that
this
court
has
said
more
than
probable
cause,
then
the
immigration
warrant
for
deportation
requires
more
in
that
regard
than
would
be
required
for
an
arrest
that
this
court
has
recognized
would
allow
this
kind
of
search
and
seizure
in
any
event
and
they
had
ample
evidence
of
it.
they
had
all
the
testimony
of
the
statement
of
hayhanen
--
hayhanen
about
this
man
being
a
spy
in
his
background
and
the
various
activities
and
they
have
this
fbi
statement
that
gives
in
detail
his
various
activities.
they
have
the
statement
that
he
purported
to
be,
that
he
was
an
alien
and
purported
to
be
a
citizen.
they
searched
the
records
at
--
when
this
was
brought
to
their
attention
and
found
that
the
record
showed
that
he
hadn't
made
any
report
to
the
attorney
general.
they
had
that
proof
that
he
had
not
complied
with
the
law
in
that
regard
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that
issue
was
tried
out
in
at
great
--
in
great
detail
and
both
lower
courts
found
against
him
on
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
a
good
faith.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
he
had
every
opportunity
to
produce
his
proof
and
did
and
the
government
introduced
its
proof
and
it
was
found
against
him
on
that
issue
of
good
faith
in
both
lower
courts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
harris
decides
that,
but
if
there's
bad
faith,
if
you're
really
using
an
arrest
as
a
device
to
try
to
get
evidence
that
it
would
be
unlawful
and
that
it's
only
when
you
act
in
good
faith,
that's
a
prerequisite.
then
after
you
proceed
in
good
faith,
if
you
find
instrumentalities
of
the
crime,
in
contraband
and
those
things
that
you
don't
have
to
“turn
around
and
close
your
eyes
to
them
and
go
away.”
that
you
can
take
them
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
--
i
just
--
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
have
to
--
do
not
concede
the
word
evidence
because
the
court
has
said
that
it
has
to
be
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
and
these
all
were,
these
seven
items.
so,
conceding
that,
there's
no
question
under
the
decisions
with
what
--
once
you're
lawfully
there
and
you
try
to
make
a
search
that
is
within
the
area
of
--
under
the
control
of
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant,
then,
any
instrumentalities
like
crime
and
contraband
or
weapons
or
other
means
of
escape
are
lawful
to
search
for
and
to
seize.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
i
--
i
was
trying
to
include
that
within
the
lawfully
there.
i
--
i
--
you
have
to
be
able
to
make
the
arrest.
you
have
to
have
probable
cause
for
believing
a
crime
has
been
committed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
or
the
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
public
wrong
is
enough
under
davis
and
zep.
that
you
then
have
a
right
to
search
the
person
and
what's
within
his
control
and
you
have
the
right
to
seize
--
those
are
two
factors
anything
that's
an
instrumentality
to
the
crime
or
contraband
or
a
means
of
escape.
now,
i
do
--
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
government
is
not
in
a
--
unfair
or
bad
position
in
regard
to
the
procedures
in
regard
to
deportation
action.
that
it
is
a
fair
proceeding
that
since
1956
only,
arrests
have
been
only
instituted
in
cases
where
it's
either
necessary
or
desirable
under
the
regulations
and
that
has
to
be
decided
by
the
district
director
or
his
deputy
and
obviously,
a
case
like
this
is
one
where
that
we
would
certainly
agree
that
was
both
necessary
and
desirable
to
take
into
custody
anybody
who
was
then
engaged
in
espionage
activities.
but,
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
has
to
be
a
prima
facie
case
instead
of
--
case
of
only
probable
cause.
so,
then
an
effort
has
been
made
by
the
congress
and
the
government
to
have
a
completely
fair
proceeding
in
regard
to
deportation
matters.
and
this
court
has
not
squarely
passed
upon
that
but
in
carlson
against
landon,
the
court
did
say
that
it
was
obvious
that
if
you're
going
to
deport
a
man,
you'll
have
to
take
him
into
custody
and
refer
to
the
statute
where
the
attorney
general
was
given
that
power
to
act
under
an
administrative
warrant
and
didn't
squarely
pass
on
it
but
certainly
by
inference,
recognized
that
it
was
a
valid
procedure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
can
answer
that
that
if
none
of
it
could
be
except
that
if
i
--
i
think
there
is
the
aspect
that
if
you
invite
me
into
your
house
and
i
--
happen
to
be
an
officer,
and
i
visit
with
you
awhile,
and
then
see
anything
that
you're
doing
is
unlawful,
i
haven't
committed
any
wrong
up
to
the
time
as
long
as
you're
not
putting
me
up.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no.
you've
got
to
have
the
probable
cause
when
--
when
you
try
to
arrest
him,
at
that
time,
you've
got
to
have
sufficient
probable
cause.
i
think
the
case
of
the
court
in
regard
to
smelling
the
heroine
out
in
the
hall
is
exactly
that
kind
of
thing
where
they
were
going
to
guess
about
who
might
be
there
and
there
was
only
one
man
in
the
room.
they
found
out
later
that
they
--
there
could
have
been
many
other
aspects
but
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
it
is
different
or
when
they
were
there,
they
knew
all
these
things.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
he
has
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
also
knew
that
before
that
that
they
had
searched
the
records
and
they
found
the
express
element
of
the
crime
that
he
had
not
reported
his
address
you
see.
that
is
what
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
he
was
continuing
not
to
register
and
that
was
the
--
that's
a
continuing
crime
in
accordance
with
the
other
holdings
of
the
case
of
the
court
along
the
same
line.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they've
checked
according
to
the
record,
a
martin
collins,
emil
goldfus
and
abel.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
noto
said
they
checked
the
records
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
of
course
that
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
well,
abel
too,
but
i
think
they
are
entitled
to
a
presumption
that
this
man
wouldn't
register.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
they
examined
the
records
for
all
three
according
to
the
record
and
they
found
that
he
--
that
he
hadn't
registered
under
any
of
them.
now,
if
they'd
--
if
he
had
registered
on
under
martin
collins
and
they
could
identify
him,
it
would
--
that
--
it
might
have
been
an
offense
because
it
couldn't
be
properly
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
the
further
fact
that
they
--
that
record
is
clear
that
they
did
search
the
record
for
each
of
those.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
record
says
they
searched
for
abel,
martin
collins
and
goldfus.
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
not
clear
as
whether
the
fbi
did
at
that
time.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
had
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
noto,
who
said
he
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
noto.
n-o-t-o,
who
said
he
searched
for
each
of
these
three
names
and
how
he
made
that
search
is
not
explained.
i
do
think
if
they
had
thought
there
was
some
discrepancy
on
--
in
regard
to
that,
it
was
up
to
them
to
bring
it
out
and
show
what
--
how
he
happened
to
know
because
it's
very
clear
that
he
made
a
search
according
to
his
testimony
and
it's
uncontradicted.
i
think
the
fact
that
this
was
not
properly
developed
before
the
lower
court
is
an
important
problem
in
this
case
and
that
the
court
should
give
serious
consideration
to.
i
tried
to
point
out
the
fact
that
the
legality
of
the
rest
was
not
raised.
in
fact,
they
conceded
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
immigration
service
to
make
the
arrest.
but
also
the
--
the
handling
of
the
case
could
have
been
much
different
and
the
government
could
have
either
had
the
--
the
court
could
have
excluded
these
items
from
the
record
and
then
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem
here.
or,
if
they
failed
to
--
if
the
court
failed
to
do
it,
then
the
government
could
have
done
it
in
light
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
that
they
had
and
avoided
any
complaint
of
error
at
this
point.
the
seven
items
are
a
very
small
part
of
the
case.
we
--
the
government
concedes
that
the
three
items
or
two
in
the
waste
basket,
and
the
one
he
tried
to
slip
up
to
his
sleeve,
would
be
prejudicial
because
those
are
the
very
kind
of
things
that
espionage
agents
use,
the
alienage
materials
that
he
had
which
were
the
spurious
and
fictitious
birth
certificates
including
another
vaccination
certificate
and
the
savings
bank
book
were
all
cumulative.
the
government
had
overwhelming
evidence
in
regard
to
all
of
those
different
activities
prior
to
the
time
that
there
was
--
the
search
was
made
for
those
and
the
seizure
was
made.
they
had
the
knowledge
of
his
bank
account
that
he
had
a
ledger
account,
that
he
had
signature
cards
under
the
name
goldfus.
they
had
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
--
and
they've
proved
all
this
in
the
case.
that
he
was
renting
and
had
lease
on
the
14th
street
property
under
the
name
of
goldfus.
they
had
the
evidence
with
regard
to
the
latham
hotel
in
fact
that
he
rented
or
took
that
room
under
the
name
of
collins.
they
had
the
fact
that
all
the
testimony
of
hayhanen
about
his
activities
as
both
gold
--
goldfus
and
collins.
they
had
the
fact
that
he
had
suggested
to
hayhanen
that
he
would
procure
for
him
and
did
procure
a
fictitious
birth
certificate
for
him
that
could
be
used
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was,
that
hayhanen
was
illegally
within
the
country.
they
had
hayhanen's
statements
to
them
that
the
petitioner
was
illegally
in
the
country
and
had
told
him
so
that
he
had
these
means
by
which
to
try
to
establish
his
identity
--
identity
as
a
citizen
if
the
question
came
up.
they
had
the
statements
of
hayhanen
that
he
--
could
escape
across
the
border
if
the
question
came
up
as
to
the
fact
that
he
was
illegally
within
the
country
as
an
alien.
all
of
those
things,
they
had
in
proof
in
the
trial.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
these
weren't
of
some
evidence,
but
i
don't
think
they
added
very
much
when
you
add
all
the
evidence
that
the
government
had
in
regard
with
alienage
question
and
his
activities
as
far
as
these
four
items
that
were
not
obtained
from
the
waste
basket
or
from
his
sleeve.
so
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
after
he
left
--
that
the
record
is
clear
that
after
they
left,
the
fbi
went
to
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
asked
kehoe
to
search
the
waste
basket
in
the
room
and
they
proceeded
to
do
it
and
these
items
were
items
that
were
concealed
as
you
probably
recall
from
the
record
the
code
book
and
the
microfilm
were
contained
in
the
--
in
this
pencil
that
could
be
taken
apart
and
the
sand
--
sanding
block
that
could
be
taken
apart.
so,
they
had
to
take
these
items
which
were
not
obviously
contraband
or
instruments
of
illegal
action
and
take
them
and
examine
them
in
a
laboratory
to
see
how
they
could
be
--
whether
they
can
be
taken
apart
and
just
how
because
it
was
very
skillfully
done.
they
also
had
of
course
evidence
of
this
petitioner's
using
these
kinds
of
instruments,
a
large
number
of
them.
in
regard
to
communications,
they
found
in
one
of
the
drops
the
--
one
of
the
messages
that
he
had
sent
but
nobody
picked
up
and
it
just
happened
that
someone
apparently
of
the
park
people
had
cemented
over
the
place
where
the
drop
was
left
and
this
bolt
that
could
be
taken
apart
that
have
been
left
there
with
the
message
in
it
but
apparently
it
was
a
message
between
hayhanen
and
the
petitioner
in
regards
to
some
of
their
activities.
so,
that
they
had
all
of
that
--
that
evidence
in
regard
to
this
case
to
just
add
these
items
on
to.
now,
it
seems
obvious
to
the
government
that
to
us
in
behalf
of
the
government
that
if
there
was
a
serious
question
raised
about
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
whether
the
arrest
could
be
made
at
that
time
and
they
have
brought
it
up
with
the
--
all
of
these
issues
about
the
fourth
amendment
and
so
forth
that
it
would
not
have
been
wise
and
that
the
government
would
have
--
would
not
have
proceeded
to
use
those
items
when
it
had
so
much
other
evidence
in
this
case
of
the
espionage
activities
and
everything
else.
and
so,
then,
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
the
court
can
properly
examine
and
of
course
i
concede
that
the
court
can
always
examine
a
constitutional
question,
but
in
regard
to
a
matter
of
this
kind,
whether
it's
properly
here,
you
said
in
the
past
that
unless
it
was
a
constitutional
question
where
you
think
that
it
will
reflect
unfairly
as
to
the
conduct
of
judicial
proceedings,
or
if
it's
an
obvious
misconstruction
of
the
law,
and
matters
of
that
kind
that
you
would
not
go
back
and
examine
here
errors
that
were
not
properly
called
to
the
attention
of
the
lower
courts.
and
you
said
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it's
unfair
that
the
litigants
should
raise
their
questions
before
the
lower
courts
so
they
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
them,
and
also
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
try
to
settle
these
matters
without
having
them
go
on
indefinitely.
and
there
isn't
any
reason
why
these
questions
couldn't
have
been
properly
raised
in
the
lower
court
if
they
had
seen
fit.
so,
we
think
that
that
alone
will
be
accumulative
character
of
this
evidence,
the
--
such
positions
are
not
properly
raised
here
and
should
not
be
considered
because
they
are
not
developed
in
this
court
under
the
rules
that
you
have
generally
adhered
to
with
regard
to
such
matters.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--i
can't
answer
that
question.
it
wasn't
developed
in
the
evidence
with
specificity
so
that
i
could
tell
you
just
where
they
came
from.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
record
fairly
shows
that
they
must
have
been
in
the
room
rather
then
the
bathroom
because
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
there
are
only
some
small
items
like
paints
and
so
forth
on
the
window
sill
of
the
bathroom.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
just
have
to
try
to
conclude
from
the
records
generally
that
they
were
in
the
room
and
they
were
in
some
of
this
closing
--
clothing
that
they
packed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
isn't
clearly
developed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there
is
some
evidence
that
one
may
examine
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
the
headquarters
that
there
were
two
of
them.
whether
they
came
under
those
in
the
room
is
not
developed
in
the
evidence.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
with
the
two
up
at
the
headquarters,
there
was
an
active
search.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
--
as
i
read
the
record,
they
didn't
discover
these
documents
until
they
started
to
tracking
them
up
and
went
through
them.
now,
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
that
they
did
make
a
search
of
the
closet
as
i
understand
the
record
before
they
found
any
of
them,
but
they
didn't
find
it
then.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
i
read
the
record
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
find
that
they
were
--
and
they
found
them
in
their
search
of
the
closet.
but
i
--
i
thought
they
did
find
them
when
they
helped
him
pack
up.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
they
have
made
very
clear
claim
that
the
room
was
searched.
and
that
to
choose
--
the
--
record
of
the
search
they
found
these
documents.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
the
issue
was
that
we
claim
that
he
asked
--
he
was
asked
whether
he
wanted
to
leave
and
they
offered
to
help
him
pack
and
they
did.
and
they
went
through
his
things
as
they
packed,
but
i
think
there
is
evidence
also
that
the
officers
went
through
the
closet
before
they
could
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
think
so.
now,
we
did
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
were
taken
after
he
left
and
after
they
got
permission
of
the
manager
to
search
the
place
after
he'd
given
up
the
room.
we
do
take
the
position,
the
government
does
that
any
discrepancies
in
clarifying
where
it
was
and
if
the
search
was
beyond
or
the
seizure
beyond
where
it
should
have
been,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
petitioner
to
show
that
in
support
of
his
action
that
if
he
left
some
loophole
as
to
what
really
happened,
that
might
be
helpful
to
him,
he
should
have
moved
forward
and
proved
it.
