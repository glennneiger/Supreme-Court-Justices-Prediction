justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you,
mr.
donovan
now
before
sealing
in
this
warrant,
do
i
understand
you
that
if
warrants
are
sworn
out
and
granted,
those
personal
research,
misrepresentations
maybe
made
to
the
district
judge
or
the
commissioner,
that
in
the
interest
--
in
public
interest,
the
warrant
should
be
kept
under
seal,
but
that
those
warrants
so
kept
under
seal
would
be
legal
warrants
for
the
action
taken
by
the
enforcing
officer,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
--
and
what
was
--
and
what
was
authorized
in
these
warrants
were
subject
to
the
same
potential
infirmity
to
which
justice
harlan
referred
namely
the
disclosure
with
--
with
half
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
called
the
same
kind
of
incriminating
non-desirably
disposable
materials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
affidavit
on
the
basis
of
which
judge
(inaudible)
made
the
order
on
august
7th
and
this
was
the
warranty
--
warrant
not
executed
as
a
means
of
getting
what
you're
complaining
of.is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
of
the
latham
search?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
conceived
to
be
the
misconception?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
donovan,
does
--
does
the
record
disclose
at
all
when
the
united
states
attorney
had
any
responsibility
in
the
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
that,
mr.
donovan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
which,
i
hope,
there's
not
an
incursion
upon
your
needed
time.
i
want
to
know
whether
the
record
shows
--
not
that
you
would
know,
the
assistant
general
would
--
might
know
--
but
does
the
record
show
the
overall
(inaudible)
this
case
came
to
trial,
is
there
anything
to
bring
the
more
concrete
(inaudible)
just
did
was
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
department
of
justice.
now,
the
department
of
justice
is
a
monstrous
great
big
building
and
a
great
big
organization.
does
it
appear
to
whom
who
was
co-ad
hoc
to
the
department
of
justice
to
whose
attentions
were
brought?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
if
there's
a
--
for
me
the
fifth
general
contention
in
mind,
the
federal
bureau
--
it
must
have
been
some
human
beings
whose
attention
was
brought,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
merely
conducted.
now,
did
they
do
it
on
their
own
or
was
there
some
legal
oversight
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
again
--
and
the
results
thereof
are
furnished
to
the
internal
security
division.
now,
that's
a
division
of
the
department
of
justice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
i
suppose
by
an
assistant
attorney
general
--
and
then
again,
on
the
bottom
of
the
page,
this
department
of
justice
had
information.
if
one
could
have
some
light,
has
bearing
on
what
your
argument
is
namely
that
these
aren't
independent
sovereignties
we're
dealing
with.
we're
dealing
subdivisions
of
a
--
of
--
with
one
top
head
officer
in
charge,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
simply
ask
whether
the
thought
--
the
details
that
might
have
come
out
at
the
trial,
but
you
say
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this.
was
this
a
deportable
alien?
was
he
a
deportable
alien?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
now,
are
you
denying
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question,
a
denial
of
the
fact
that
the
purposes
of
deportation
proceeding.
supposed
i've
had
been
calling
independence
so
far
as
the
i.n.s.
is
concerned,
for
purposes
of
deportation
proceedings,
the
i.n.s.
could've
proceeded
the
way
they
did
proceed.
are
you
denying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying,
if
i
get
your
argument
is
that
this
was
not
an
independent
deportation
determinable
--
determined
proceeding,
but
this
was
a
blind
(inaudible),
the
department
of
justice
on
its
criminal
side
in
case
the
hope
or
expectation
or
desire
that
he
make
full
disclosure
should
pay.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
do
you
--
but
on
your
statement,
on
your
statement
of
facts,
is
that
necessary
or
even
desirable
for
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
have
--
even
though
they
averse
--
would
have
been
lawful?
could
they
have
made
the
comprehensive
seizure
that
was
made
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
failure
to
do
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
failure
to
have
taken
to
the
united
commission
on
a
--
bringing
one
up
(inaudible)
but
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
as
to
the
right
of
seizure
of
all
this
materials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
261.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
ask
this,
do
i
understand
from
what
you
say
that
you
would
deny
that
an
f.b.i.
agent
could
make
an
affidavit
setting
for
--
that
information
that
comes
to
him
on
the
--
from
reliable
sources,
the
identity
of
the
informant
not
disclosable
for
this
and
this
reason,
giving
the
following
information
that
that
would
not
furnish
an
affidavit
on
the
basis
of
a
warrant
could
legally
be
issued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
wouldn't
have
to
disclose
the
name
of
this
informant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
wouldn't
have
to
reveal
the
source.
he
just
say
and
i'm
reliably
informed
that
the
following
fact
or
event
that
in
fact
exist
or
event
that
taken
place
on
the
basis
at
which
it
is
necessary
to
apprehend
john
jones.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
been
pretty
--
pretty
regardful
of
the
difficulties
of
--
of
enforcement
and
the
indication
of
criminal
code
to
allow
his
hearsay
and
all
sorts
of
things,
but
cutting
short
the
kind
of
information
on
which
men
act
in
their
daily
lives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
roughly
speaking,
that's
been
enough
to
get
it
to
sustain
a
legal
warrant,
hasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we'd
rather
to
take
that
off
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
this
particularly
if
you
have
time
to
deal
with
it
at
the
time
that
you
have
left?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
relevance
of
good
faith
(inaudible)
so
the
test
to
the
fact
of
good
faith
is
the
question
whether
or
not
the
fourth
amendment
has
or
has
not
in
this
regard.
what's
the
relevance
of
that?
even
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assuming
that
the
harris
case
says
so
known
use
to
you
that
the
harris
case
had
been
constantly
on
the
trier
in
this
court
raising
a
constitutional
question
which
can
only
be
opened
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
have
time
in
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
scheme
of
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
simple
question
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
i
do
not
doubt
meaning
by
good
faith
that
it
was
conscientiously
being
this
is
the
wise
and
right
thing
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
fair
definition
of
good
faith?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
didn't
proceed
from
that
assumption.
it
proceeded
from
the
contrary
assumption.
this
was
simply
the
high-minded
conscientiously
conceived
procedure
on
the
part
of
the
enforcing
authority.
what
i
want
to
bring
is
what
difference
it
makes
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
fourth
amendment
whether
in
a
search
or
a
seizure,
they
are
not
identical,
which
if
there
weren't
some
excuse
with
reference
to
deportation,
would
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
fourth
amendment.
what
difference
does
it
make
that
on
the
right
side
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
--
that
the
steps
that
were
taking
or
excusable
or
justifiable
for
purposes
of
deportation,
but
the
proof
of
the
enterprise
is
not
to
secure
deportation
but
to
get
a
conviction
for
a
capital
offense
or
maybe
a
capital
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
to
have
it
for
purpose
of
deportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
usable
for
purposes
of
a
criminal
conviction,
particularly
of
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
--
is
it
fair
to
say
or
to
assume
that
at
no
time
during
the
period
that
the
administrative
warrant
--
let
me
rephrase,
i
mean,
that
from
the
time
that
an
administrative
warrant
was
determined
upon
(inaudible)
that
from
that
time
on,
there
was
already
reasonable
ground,
speaking
out
technically
or
administratively
that
there
--
in
the
minds
of
the
department
that
this
is
a
potential
espionage
case
as
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
coincident
with
pursuing
means
for
getting
in
deported
was
the
hope
and
desire
that
he
--
that
he
also
would
be
charged
with
a
crime
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
that
you
had
sufficient
evidence
in
justifying
the
government
to
go
into
court
and
put
him
to
trial
but
it
was
in
the
mind
of
the
authority
that
this
is
a
potential
spy
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
thought
of
getting
but
not
abandoned,
in
other
words,
the
open
expectation
that
it
would
turn
out,
as
it
did
turn
out
had
not
been
abandoned
or
--
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
had
been
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
had
been
abandoned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
answered
--
you
answered
in
--
didn't
answer
to
a
question
of
mine
yesterday
that
it
was
not
feasible
to
swear
out
of
search
warrant
on
secondary
evidence
by
an
f.b.i.
agent
because
there
would
have
been
a
disclosure
which
the
government
was
naturally
not
--
not
willing
to
make,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
to
that
point.
now,
the
question
i
put
to
you
this
morning
is
on
a
different
attack,
namely,
assuming
such
a
difficulty
confronted
the
government
could
had
circumvent,
that
--
that
carries
an
odium
which
i
do
not
need
to
carry
--
convey,
could
the
government,
as
a
matter
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
new
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment,
could
the
government
abandon
because
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
appropriate
witness
or
witnesses,
could
the
government
abandon
both
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
yet
proceed,
assuming
it
could
legally
proceed,
by
way
of
deportation
and
make
the
administrative
enforcer,
the
administrative
warrant
in
the
course
of
that
make
a
search
and
make
seizure
which
independently
considered
would
not
be
warranted
in
the
criminal
case,
nevertheless,
use
such
products,
a
proof
thereof
in,
what
turned
out
to
be
happily,
the
basis
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
that's
my
problem
that
i
put
to
you,
and
i
hope
you
would
have
something
to
say
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
do
that,
i
just
want
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
you
naturally
enough
because
the
court's
opinion
that
even
you
leave
to
do
so
or
lead
you
do
to
so,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
say
there
may
be
reasonable
search.
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
not
be
unreasonably
that
goes
on
as
part
of
the
same
sentence
to
indicate
what
an
unreasonable
search
is,
namely,
one
without
a
warrant
and
the
warrant
specified
to
carry
with
it
the
detailed
and
the
particularity
that
the
fourth
amendment
enumerate
and
all
the
rest
seizures
without
any
warrant
historically
was
doubtful,
but
(inaudible)
was
talked
about.
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
you
could
make
seizure
even
with
a
warrant.
and
the
fourth
amendment
put
in
the
qualification
which
illuminated
the
first
half
of
the
fourth
amendment
what
it
is
that
constitutes
an
unreasonable
search,
namely,
one
without
a
warrant,
and
the
case
here
is
a
matter
of
necessity
like
a
fellow
running
away
or
there
isn't
group
time
for
it,
have
read
into
that
amendment
the
qualifications
that
i
--
i
insist,
if
i
may
respectfully,
that
it's
very
important
not
to
read
that
amendment
as
authorizing
reasonable
search.
that's
a
gloss
in
--
from
my
point
of
view
and
on
warrant
of
a
gloss
on
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
takes
them
to
get
filed
up,
i
started
out
by
saying
you
have
every
warrant
to
say
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
--
in
calling
out
cases,
i
should,
after
probing,
you're
saying
there
was
time
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
that
--
what
did
you
say
about
it?
that
if
there
is
time
you
must
get
a
warrant,
have
we
ever
--
have
we
ever
held
that
as
adoption
or
said
merely
because
there
was
time,
doesn't
exclude
consideration
of
other
factors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
matters
of
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
case
(inaudible)
doesn't
matter.
the
--
the
rabinowitz
case
went
on
some
petition
or
ground,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
say
it's
an
immaterial
factor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
but
this
doesn't
--
therefore,
you
defend
this
man.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
was
time
or
not.
you
justify
the
legality
of
it
being
an
independent
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
time
you
argued
doesn't
displace
those
other
legalizing
evidence,
isn't
not
what
the
position
you
take?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
the
course
of
--
of
illegal
enterprise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
transfer
that
which
was
legal
with
reference
to
the
pursuit
that
was
made,
i.e.
deportation,
does
not
bar
the
use
of
testimony
so
secured
in
what
subsequent
they
became
a
criminal
prosecution
and
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
still
troubled
by
what
seems
to
me
a
necessary
(inaudible)
and
i'd
say
he
can't
be
taken
but
it
does
require
a
transfer.
you
argue
in
the
first
place
that
the
restrictions
as
to
search
and
seizure
that
applied
to
an
unembarrassed
or
an
unequivocal
criminal
prosecution
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
this
was
just
a
criminal
prosecution,
for
all
i
know,
you
wouldn't
be
here
defending.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
deportation
proceeding.
i
thought
you
do
--
you
do
rely
on
it
and
say
since
what
you've
got,
you
got
in
the
course
of
a
proceeding
which
is
legal
because
it
is
for
purpose
of
the
deportation,
you
then
had
a
windfall
and
you
can
process
by
the
windfall
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
that's
what
i
call
making
a
jump,
that
because
you
would
be
justified
in
using
this
materials
under
this
procedure
to
be
brought
in,
you're
also
justified
in
using
it
in
order
to
convict
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you've
got
two
grounds
and
say
you
--
you
got
this
in
a
legal
--
in
a
legal
deportation
proceeding,
therefore,
you
can
use
it,
there's
no
taint
to
it,
but
in
any
event,
you
say
even
if
you
didn't
have
that,
the
search
and
seizure
here
were
incident,
your
lawful
arrest
when
you
could
--
you
could
have
made
these
things
to
move,
legally
made
procedure
and
to
get
the
benefit
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
bar
you
from
arguing
anymore
to
debar
me
from
sustaining
their
judgment
below
on
a
ground
which
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
take.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
wouldn't
it
shed
a
light
under
justification,
if
you
do
not
treat
--
so
if
you
do
not
treat
the
seizure
as
incident
to
an
arrest
for
which
you
have
probable
cause
and
you
do
not
so
treat
it
because
you
do
not
follow
the
consequences,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
just
suggest,
then
you
can
justify
it
because
the
conduct
negative
the
justification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
if
we
have
done
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
claim
it's
an
arrest
for
purpose
of
search
and
seizure,
but
not
an
arrest
for
purpose
of
protecting
him
in
a
way
in
which
an
arrested
person
is
protected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
--
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that.
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
probability
is
negative
by
the
fact
that
you
don't
draw
the
consequences
of
what
--
of
what
you
justify
as
probability
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
and
it
exhaust
itself
in
seizing
and
therefore,
one
has
a
right
to
say,
you
seize
because
you
wanted
to
seize
and
not
because
it
was
incident
to
an
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
say
it
does
evaporate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me,
all
the
shed
light
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
a
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
a
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
they
got
on
the
premises
--
they
got
on
the
premises
because
in
their
head,
there
was
a
conviction
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
if
that
is
true,
then
they
have
no
business,
as
i
understand
it,
then
they
would
have
to
get
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
you
say
they
knew
they
had
all
this
fact
in
their
head,
that
constituted
probable
cause.
i
suggest
it
constitutes
probable
cause
for
getting
a
warrant
for
arrest
but
not
for
going
in
and
arresting
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
acts
were
they
permitted
in,
except
the
evidence
of
what
the
basis
on
which
they
proceeded
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
the
consequences
of
this
is
far-reaching,
mr.
solicitor,
being
that
if
arrest
--
if
--
if
the
department
of
justice
officials
have
good
reasons
for
getting
a
warrant
of
arrest
for
a
man
but
they
don't
get
a
warrant
of
arrest,
they
enter
his
premises,
they
ask
him
a
question,
they
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he's
going
to
lie,
they
now
say,
"oh,
you
liar
because
we
know
that
isn't
your
true
name."
that
would
make
hash
of
the
duty
to
get
a
warrant
of
arrest
as
well
as
the
duty
to
get
a
warrant
for
search.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
effect
of
making
the
so-called
administrative
office‘s
magistrate,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
i
must
trouble
you
with
one
more
question,
and
i
think
i
am
praying
on
your
side
as
on
that
in
this
question.
the
giordenello
case,
let's
get
things
straight,
i
will
understand
that
if
the
government
or
anybody
else
seeks
to
justify
a
judgment
on
a
theory
which
would
have
involved
examination
of
a
witness
in
order
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
theory
and
those
such
examination
was
made
or
opportunity
given
because
the
theory
wasn't
advanced,
you
can't
espouse
that
theory
in
sustaining
the
judgment.
that's
giordenello.
you
got
a
different
doctrine
which
may
or
may
not
be
applicable
to
this
situation
that
if
the
record
that
it
comes
here
permits
sustaining
a
judgment
which
doesn't
require
any
testimony
to
contradict
or
to
qualify,
but
on
the
face
of
the
record
permits
the
judgment
to
be
vindicated
on
a
theory
not
advanced
for
anybody
neither
counsel
or
the
lower
court.
this
court
is
not
debarred,
indeed
it
--
its
duty
to
sustain
that
judgment
because
we
hear
review
judgments
and
not
talk
and
therefore,
i
suggested
to
you,
that
you
could
sustain
this
judgment
on
any
theory
so
not
advanced
heretofore
subject
to
the
qualification
of
the
giordenello
case,
namely,
that
it
wouldn't
have
required
examination
of
witnesses
because
in
the
giordenello
case,
what
was
involved
for
the
examination
of
witnesses
in
order
to
satisfy,
if
it
could
be
satisfied,
the
requirements
of
texas
law.
i
do
not
know
on
this
record
whether
the
second
theory,
the
other
theory,
which
you
say
you
advanced
here
for
the
first
time,
namely,
that
on
this
record,
the
arrest
and
the
search
were
justified,
not
merely
on
the
administrative
process
so-called
but
because
a
crime
was
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
arresting
officers
and
the
searching
officers.
if
the
record
sustains
that,
then
i
think
you'll
open
to
sustaining
it
on
that
ground
and
this
court
is
--
is
open
and
entitled
to
it,
indeed
must,
if
it
can
sustain
the
judgment
below
on
that
ground.
those
are
two
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
it
may
have
been
by
the
petitioner
but
on
the
basis
of
the
issue
as
shaped
by
the
government.
and
that
would
--
if
that
is
so,
and
the
testimony
might
bring
out
a
--
a
different
result,
then
you
would
in
giordenello,
but
if
the
record
doesn't
present
such
a
situation,
then
giordenello
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
then
it
isn't
giordenello.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
exhibit
number,
if
you
give
the
exhibit
numbers,
those
are
admitted
into
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
donovan,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
sit
down
--
before
you
sit
down,
i'll
try
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
only
to
minimize
your
(inaudible)
by
asking
a
technical
question.
is
there
any
case
in
this
court,
i
should
have
asked
this
to
the
solicitor
general,
is
there
any
case
in
this
court
dealing
with
deportation
in
which
this
court
considered
the
scope
of
the
right
of
search
and
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
relation
to
deportation
(voice

--
justice
felix

none.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
anything
come
through
immigration
and
naturalization
to
indicate
that
this
presented
our
case
where
they
have
duty
of
investigation
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
a
reference
to
his
illegal
presence
in
the
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
before
this
meeting,
this
confabulation
between
the
f.b.i.
and
naturalization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
know
how
far
the
door
was
opened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
donovan,
may
i
ask
you
not
to
argue,
but
just
to
state
your
conclusion
whether
what
happened
up
to
the
time
that
they
signaled
that
you
just
put
in?
the
naturalization
immigration
people
to
make
the
arrest,
up
to
that
point,
did
you
claim
below
or
do
you
claim
here,
there
was
any
violation
of
any
provision
of
the
constitution
or
any
statute
of
the
united
states?
i
don't
want
an
argument,
i
just
want
an
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
improbable
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
donovan,
may
i
suggest
this,
i
think
i'm
--
he
claims
for
breaking
into
your
narrative,
i
just
want
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest,
instead
of
presenting
that
--
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
one
of
apprehension
for
illegal
presence
in
the
country,
a
deportability
on
that
ground
was
not
an
illegal
--
that
apprehension
for
that
purpose
was
not
illegal,
then
a
question
may
arise,
i
do
not
say
it
does
arise,
it
may
arise,
whether
certain
consequences
on
the
basis
of
that
legal
apprehension
do
not
cloak
in
relation
to
the
seizure
--
of
a
search
and
seizure
of
government.
i'm
not
suggesting
you
should
argue
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
that
makes
it
irrelevant
as
i
understood
it
of
the
question
put
by
my
brother
harlan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
im
not
saying
it
is
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
side
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
other
side
is,
mr.
donovan
that
the
fact
that
a
man
may
also
be
an
espionage
suspect,
ought
not
to
preclude
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
carrying
out
the
law
against
illegal
residents
in
this
country.
i'm
not
suggesting
either
of
these
your
proposition
of
mind
answer
the
problem
of
this
case.i
merely
suggest
that
they're
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say,
you
do
not
want
him
to
discover
the
immigration
warrant
from
the
brutality
of
the
arrest,
trial
and
conviction,
an
affirmative
conviction
of
the
petitioner
for
the
crimes
for
he
was
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you're
argument,
to
get
a
--
you're
arguing
your
case
not
ours,
but
it
is
my
case.
as
i
understand
your
argument
a
little
differently,
it
is
that
you're
not
here
to
challenge
(inaudible)
the
arrest,
the
apprehension
under
the
administrative
warrant
for
legal
cases.
you're
not
here
to
challenging
what
inquiredly
under
such
authority
of
the
arrest
--
for
arrest.
either
didn't
the
search
and
seizure
of
documents
relevant
to
--
exclusively
relevant
to
deportation,
you're
saying
things
that
right
here
has
travelled
far
outside
what
an
administrative
warrant
or
any
implied
right
from
search
and
seizure
would
have
justified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
whether
you
challenge
it,
whether
you
not
challenge
it,
it
maybe
very
important
to
whether
--
it
maybe
very
important
whether
or
not,
being
(inaudible)
or
whatever
reasons
you
chose
not
to
challenge
the
legality
of
arrest
for
deportation,
you
just
challenged
that.
now,
as
justice
harlan
said
the
consequences
of
that
maybe
another
case,
but
you
can't
come
here
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
and
say
you
now
have
a
challenge,
the
warrant
for
apprehension
for
deportation,
restricted
to
that
legal
act
on
the
consequence
of
that
legal
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
a
missing
hypothetical
to
consider
whether
it
is
relevant
that
if
the
warrant
of
arrest
or
deportation
not
challenged
impliedly
in
law
to
authorize
and
use
--
make
certain
doctrine
of
--
and
it
didn't
challenge
that,
that
maybe
relevant
to
the
consequences
of
that
as
far
as
the
criminal
prosecution.
i'm
not
saying
it
is,
but
it's
made
it.
justice

the
question
regarding
your

i

point
you
make

that

i'm
not

question?
which
domain

i
don't

is

suppose

gathering
finds
out
that
john
smith
is
a
deportable
alien.
and
suppose
up
to
that
time,
the
naturalization
and
immigration
service
had
never
known
the
existence
of
john
smith
or
it's
his
illegal
presence
in
the
country.
suppose
they
then
issue
an
administrative
warrant
for
his
arrest,
let's
call
it
that
and
he
is
--
that
the
court
order
following
it
was
deportation.
is
that
a
risk,
if
there's
nothing
more,
took
the
facts
until
your

are
made,
is
that
a
risk
and
court
order

invalid

all

was

that
the

case?

he's
indifferent.
he's
indifferent
with
the
determination
whether
the
administrative
warrant
of
arrest
was
legal
and
he's
indifferent
to
that
because
he
says
“none
of
the
subsequent
--
none
of
the
things
that
flowed
from
that
arrest
are
thereby
legalized.”
and
you
say
if
i
get
your
argument
that
you
can't
tell
whether
what
was
done
after
the
arrest
was
legal
or
not,
until
you
determine
whether
the
arrest
is
legal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
arrest
--
if
the
arrest
doesn't
bear
on
what
was
done
in
texas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
arrest
is
from
your
point
of
view,
bears
on
whatever
search
and
seizure
may
have
taken
place
at
the
hotel
and
in
mr.
latham's
--
in
mr.
donovan's
view,
is
irrelevant
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
clash
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
have
two
separate
questions
if
i
may
suggest,
mr.
solicitor,
namely,
how
far
you
may
search
the
person
upon
a
legal
arrest
for
the
things
in
his
possession
and
it's
totally
different
--
for
me,
a
totally
different
question,
is
what
the
range
of
what
is
called
a
search
of
person?
what
may
you
take
that's
physically
not
on
this
person
or
not
visible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
two
very
different
questions.
and
i
think
--
and
i
think
the
proposition
you're
tendering
as
i
understand
you
is
that
if
there's
a
legal
arrest,
you
may
search
the
person
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
arrested
person
isn't
going
to
do
violence
or
have
means
of
escape
to
avoid
the
arrest.
and
if
in
the
course
of
searching
a
person,
you
find
for
instance,
a
pocketful
of
narcotics,
illegal
narcotics,
illegally
possessed,
you
may
take
also
those
off.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
matter
what
the
--
no
matter
what
he's
arrested
for,
if
the
arrest
is
legal,
then
you
may
search
this
person.
but
i
suggest
there's
a
totally
different
question
and
that's
the
one
that
was
raised
in
davis,
in
zap,
harris,
et
cetera,
all
the
rest
of
them
namely,
what
the
range
of
that
implication
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
you
shouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
arrive
at
mr.
chief
justice's
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
before
you
sit
down,
can
you
speak
and
answer,
could
you,
suppose
harris
have
been
decided
contrary
wise,
suppose
it
would
--
that's
in
--
that's
in
a
reversal
there
instead
of
an
affirmance
(inaudible)
would
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
make
it
different
at
least,
not
--
would
that
make
a
difference?
or
what
would
be
the
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
what
will
be
the
bearing
on
the
government
condition
that
harris
had
been
reversed
instead
of
what's
now?
well,
you
couldn't
answer.
those
are
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
wouldn't,
of
course,
in
your
own
arranged
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
understand
you
to
answer
justice
harlan
a
little
earlier
that
all
the
four
items,
the
other
four
items,
were
--
were
tied
to
or
related
to
or
relevant
to
his
deportability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
when
you
say
there
was
time
for
a
search
warrant,
as
of
what
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
say
--
begin
with
--
beginning
with
the
issue
of
the
administrative
warrant
or
there
was
time
that
--
as
judge
learned
hand
(inaudible)
one
of
these
cases
that
when
they
found
these
things,
there
was
--
there
was
opportunity
to
hold
him
to
be
--
to
assure
that
he
would
not
escape
then
go
out
and
get
a
search
warrant
while
the
appropriate
officials
took
--
took
care
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
one
--
which
one
do
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
position
is,
you
relied
on
the
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you're
on
--
since
you're
in
texas,
before
you
leave
texas,
could
you
please
state
to
us
--
in
texas
during
his
sojourn
in
texas,
there
were
any
searches
and
seizures.
i'm
not
now
addressing
myself
whether
they
were
illegal
or
not.
was
there
anything
taken
from
him,
against
his
wish
either
implied
or
explicit
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
of
the
trial
or
were
there
any
communications
made
by
him
to
any
of
the
officers
which
could
--
he
could
have
resisted
upon,
proposed
the
introduction
of
the
trial
as
being
coerced
confession
which
affected
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
took
place,
both
accepting
it
was
resisted
at
the
trial
either
by
a
motion
to
suppress
or
an
objection
to
an
offer
heard
inside
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
could
knock
on
the
door
and
he
could
let
him
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
come
to
you
in
some
of
the
--
not
to
summarize
but
to
deal
in
particularity
with
the
four
so-called
identifying
items
bearing
on
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
(inaudible)
just
whether
those
four
documents
were
when
--
where
they
were
when
the
officer
entered
the
room
and
of
course
by
reaching
the
place
from
which
they
came
into
their
possession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
for
the
--
in
the
--
does
the
record
show
whether
they
were
in
the
room
in
which
the
transactions
--
or
in
which
they
were
present
or
in
some
--
they
were
in
the
bathroom
or
bedroom,
or
whatever.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
what
does
appear
from
the
records
to
show
the
--
the
spatial
relation
in
the
room
that
they
faced,
between
those
documents
and
the
officers
when
they
took
hold
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
they
come
up
on
them
as
they
put
the
clothing
in
the
suitcase
or
trunk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
the
evidence
doesn't
disclose
there
wasn't
--
that
they
came
into
the
possession
of
the
officers
through
an
active
search
of
the
premises.
can
you
answer
that?
was
there
an
active
search
which
resulted
in
the
discovery
in
those
three
--
in
the
subsequent
seizure
of
these
documents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
after
the
--
after
the
baggage
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
in
the
room
--
was
there
a
search
in
the
room
--
was
there
a
search
out
of
the
room?
the
officer
which
disclosed
the
existence
of
documents
which
the
officers
then
took
hold
off.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
developed
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
didn't
do
with
the
tracking,
i
am
treading
on
dangerous
territories,
they
did
do
the
tracking
after
they
asked
his
wishes
about
it,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
in
the
mouth
of
the
closet
that
these
four
documents
or
any
of
them.
they
didn't
come
out
of
the
closet.
to
their
conscious
knowledge
they
didn't
come
out
of
the
closet
in
some
clothing
they
took.
i
bother
you
with
these
questions
because
for
reasons
that
you
(inaudible)
the
mind
--
you
know
the
attitude
about
these
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
wasn't
--
can
you
--
can
you
say
this
even
at
the
risk
of
boring
repetition,
there
wasn't
a
claim
made
by
the
defendant
below
that
in
fact
there
was
a
search
of
the
room
and
in
the
course
of
that
search,
they
came
upon
these
documents.
was
that
claim
made
explicitly
like
that
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
evidence
that
these
--
these
papers
were
the
fruit
of
that
closet
search?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
wasn't
he
told
that
he
could
have
counsel
was
there
no
telling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
witness
that
--
who
testified
that
he
was
told
he
could
have
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
there
a
--
lawyer
in
person?
did
it
--
abel
have
a
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
know
that
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
you
got
one
now,
haven't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
we
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let's
get
back
to
the
question
that
he
was
told
that
he
could
have
a
lawyer.
where
do
i
find
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
regulation,
but
the
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
indicating
your
(inaudible)
what
there
is
about
the
seven
items
that
makes
the
government
club
them
together
and
so
they
constitute
a
separate
class?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
a
seven,
why
not
six
or
nine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
isn't
talking
about
arrest,
we
talked
about
lawfully
on
the
premises.
would
you
--
would
you
agree
or
disagree
that
first
the
fbi
could
knock
at
my
house
tonight
and
asked
to
be
let
in
and
then
i
ask
me
would
i
gladly
tell
about
john
jones?
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
tell
them
to
get
out,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
you
willing
to
say
that
--
or
you
can
say
that
knock
at
the
door
--
on
the
door
and
not
seeking
to
arrest
you
or
not
being
lawfully
on
the
premises,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i
wouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
my
question
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is
whether
the
f.b.i
simply
could
come
to
me
7:30
and
rouse
my
maid
instead
of
the
sleepy
masters
and
ask
them,
could
we
see
the
justice
we
want
to
ask
him
about
john
jones?
would
that
be
unlawful?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
whom
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
also
perfectly
well-known
and
you
thought
it
was
in
the
height
public
or
in
the
height
of
public
interest
that
fbi
simply
might
ask
somebody
who
is
under
the
decision
for
espionage
to
become
a
defectively
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
also
well-known.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
thought
that
was
in
a
high
public
service?
