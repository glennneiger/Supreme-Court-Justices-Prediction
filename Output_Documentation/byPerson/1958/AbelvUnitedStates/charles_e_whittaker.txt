this
exhibit
shown

appendix
c.
it
all
takes
it
from
petitioner's
room
on
his
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
talking
about
derivative
matters,
now.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
contend
that
there
was
taken
by
the
i.n.s.
agents
from
this
room
anything
more
than
the
two
birth
certificates,
the
vaccination
certificate
and
the
bank
book
and
this
numerical
coded
message?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
by
i.n.s.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
your
argument
that
what
he
took,
in
the
way
of
his
clothing,
they
took.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
--

you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
understand
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
(inaudible)
to
understand
how
important,
you
see
the
other
warrant,
well
had
there
been
any
other
warrant
before
the
one
served
by
the
immigration
officers?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you
bring,
if
i
may
ask,
that
is
your
thought
to
be
suppressed
or
claim
to
have
been
seized
by
the
fbi
during
that
30-minute
interview
or
period?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
--
was
there
any
search
made
or
anything
at
all
taken
into
possession
prior
to
the
time
the
immigration
officials
served
this
administrative
arrest
warrant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
i
would
like
to
know
what
happened
with
respect
to
items
in
the
suitcase
other
than
these
two
birth
certificates,
the
vaccination
certificate
and
the
bank
book
and
the
three
pieces
of
paper
that
he
was
putting
up
his
sleeve.
now,
the
rest
of
this
material
in
the
room
was
put
in
the
suitcases.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
was
taken
out
with
him.
now,
was
there
a
motion
to
suppress
other
things?
did
the
motion
contain
a
list
of
the
other
things
and
seek
to
suppress
them?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
the
motion
to
suppress
sustained
as
to
all
items
except
these
seven?
or
were
they
withdrawn
from
the
motion
or
what
happened?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
removed
from
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
was
to
obtain
evidence
of
espionage.
now,
that
is
tried
out?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
contested
evidence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
would
concede
that
isn't
it
that
if
the
contents
of
his
argument
were
not
true,
would
that
--
would
the
search
would
be
valid?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
i
understand
your
argument,
(inaudible)
that
for
one
type
of
evidence
and
you
record
in
this
(inaudible)
you
got
one
to
other
evidence
and
made
it
other
times,
you
may
take
that
lawfully
also?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
is
the
crime
lawfully
there
like
the
right
response
or
it
resulted
to
the
arrest
which
still
happened
to
be
lawful?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
crime,
it
has
to
be
crime?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
public
wrong?
