(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
affidavit
transferred
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
one
of
their
statements
and
arguments
(inaudible)
the
reason
they
did
not
proceed
by
an
arrest
warrant
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
this
--
at
this
point
in
your
argument
--
i
want
to
get
oriented
--
at
this
point
in
your
argument,
are
you
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
right
to
search
incident
to
the
administrative
warrant
or
is
it
part
of
your
argument
that
there
was
no
such
right
to
search?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
why
do
--
what
if
--
if
that's
true,
what
difference
does
it
make
about
all
of
this
good
faith
argument
if
there
was
no
such
right
to
search,
because
the
government
doesn't
seek
to
defend
this
search
on
any
basis
other
than
its
being
incident
to
a
valid
administrative
warrant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
place
that
i
get
completely
lost
on
that
is
this.
i
understood
you
just
say
a
moment
ago
that
it
was
your
position
that
even
though
the
administrative
warrant
was
legally
issued,
there
was
no
right
of
search
which
was
appurtenant
to
the
execution
of
such
a
warrant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
follow
through
on
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
for
a
moment.supposing
the
f.b.i.
had
not
shown
its
hand
in
this
case
at
all,
they
weren't
in
it
and
exactly
the
same
chain
of
circumstances
had
happened,
the
i.n.s.
proceeding
wholly,
independently,
the
search
made
pursuant
to
an
independent
warrant,
do
you
say
they
then
could
not
have
turned
over
that
information
to
the
--
to
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
this
case
--
take
my
case
--
take
my
case
please.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
those
things
are
perfectly
arguable
things.my
difficulty
is
that
i
don't
see
where
the
presence
of
the
f.b.i.
in
this
situation
either
adds
or
detracts
in
your
case.
that's
my
thought.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
hayhanen
testify
at
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
brought
about
his
change
of
attitude?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
shown
on
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
were
the
--
was
there
anything
on
the
record
--
perhaps
the
record
will
say
what's
been
the
practice
of
these
--
these
administrative
warrants.
i
--
are
you
opening
that
warrant
by
a
search
by
the
district?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
surroundings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
your
argument
--
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter
is
that
you
say
you
have
a
right
to
search
incident
to
an
administrative
arrest
that
the
scope
of
that
right
to
search
is
certainly
no
narrower
than
the
scope
under
harris,
that
testing
their
search
by
the
harris
standards
is
good
as
an
administrative
search,
isn't
--
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
what
you
meant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
--
well,
that's
justice
brennan's
question
and
i
have
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
same
confusion
that
he
does.
i
understood
you
to
say
to
him
first
that
if
your
administrative
search
defense
was
not
accepted
by
the
court,
you
then
felt
that
you
would
--
could
not
testify
this
on
any
other
ground.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
you
don't
argue
it,
i
take
it,
is
because
of
what
we
said
in
the
giordenello
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
these
people
did
not
have
a
chance
to
justify
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
on
a
basis
that
wasn't
advanced
by
you
there.
that's
the
problem
and
you're
rubbing
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
--
as
i
understand
your
brief
(inaudible)
being
led
to
making
an
argument
by
the
questions
of
the
court
if
you
don't
make
in
your
brief
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
other
words,
you
do
not
depend
in
your
brief
the
search
and
seizure
independently
of
its
being
a
valid
search
incident
to
be
administrative
arrest.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
draw
assessments
from
the
giordenello
case
on
another
basis,
namely,
when
you
come
to
answering
your
adversary's
arguments
as
to
the
scope
of
the
search
you
say
therefore,
closed
in
raising
that
up
here
because
they
didn't
raise
it
below
and
under
the
giordenello
doctrine,
they
can't
be
heard
to
argue
that
when
you
had
no
opportunity
to
depend
them
on
that
score
in
the
court
below.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
you
were
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
seems
to
me
you
are
being
--
you
are
being
led
into
an
argument
here
which
puts
you
in
an
inconsistent
position
and
it's
quite
different
from
the
one
that
you
make
in
your
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statute
of
congress
purports
to
authorize
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
opponents
don't
question
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
they
admitted
into
evidence
under
those
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
admitted
into
evidence
of
the
crime?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
means
that
qua
deportation,
you
concede
the
validity
of
this
warrant,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
point
is
you
do
not
rely
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
--
in
your
case
on
the
--
any
alleged
infirmity
of
the
warrant
qua
a
deportation
warrant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
i'm
wondering
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
not
your
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
just
want
to
be
--
make
sure
i
understand
specifically.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
relation
to
the
questions
put
by
the
court
or
some
of
the
questions
put
by
the
court
in
the
order
for
reargument,
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
contend
in
this
case
that
the
administrative
warrant
was
invalid
under
any
statute
which
governed
its
issuance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
what
i
mean,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
consequences
that
throw
him
the
warrant.
i'm
just
taking
about
the
validity
of
the
warrant
itself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
about
the
validity
of
the
warrant
within
the
confines
whatever
they
are
the
deportation
case.
you're
not
questioning
the
validity
of
the
warrants.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
includes
no
attack
on
the
validity
of
the
warrant
qua
deportation
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we'd
be
going
outside
the
four
corners
of
the
argument,
if
we
viewed
the
case
in
that
standpoint.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
court
sua
sponte
so
to
speak,
wants
to
inquire
into
the
validity
of
this
warrant,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
the
search
following
from
the
warrant,
has
stated
the
record
as
such
that
the
court
is
not
foreclosed
in
considering
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
first,
you
got
to
go
down.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
i'm
obtuse,
but
i
don't
understand
what
substance
you
get
out
of
this
statement
to
your
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
premise
of
that
argument
is
and
what
they
did
is
illegal
which
is
the
thing
we're
here
to
decide.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
an
interstitial
question
before
you
go
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
an
immigration
offense
--
offense
under
the
immigration
law
as
distinguished
from
the
events
of
espionage
that
was
involved
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
offense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
was
the
offense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
failure
to
register.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
do
you
--
do
you
argue
that
some
of
the
things
that
were
seized
here
were
instrumentalities
of
that
immigration
offense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
that
extent,
you
don't
have
to
go
beyond
whatever
rights
if
it's
the
man
in
search,
if
he
or
if
there
are
any,
we
don't
have
to
go
beyond
the
case
of
those
under
the
immigration
laws.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
anything
you
except
for
that
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
only
items
that
were
received
in
evidence
of
the
trial
is
--
of
which
he
was
convicted
was
the
seven
items
we've
been
talking
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
the
validity
of
the
search
and
seizure
that
produced
these
seven
items
that
we
have?
