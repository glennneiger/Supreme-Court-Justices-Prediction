justice

(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
to
get
clarification,
i
don't
quite
understand.
suppose
there
had
been
no
so-called
administrative
warrant
at
hold,
would
your
argument
has
been
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
--
you
do
not
put
and
it
relies
then
on
the
administrative
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
how
can
you
rely
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
it
comply?
could
--
could
the
f.b.i.
issue
a
warrant
like
that
without
going
to
a
magistrate
to
arrest
the
man
for
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
i'm
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i
understand
that
what
you
are
saying
is,
that's
what
i
asked,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
that
they
didn't
have
to
have
anyone
either
from
a
magistrate
or
from
the
administrative
officer
for
whatever
that's
worth.
i
don't
know
what
its
worth.
you're
saying
they
didn't
have
to
have
any
warrant
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
go
in
and
arrest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
may
say
that
i'm
puzzled
still.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
--
maybe
it
is
contrary
to
what
your
argument
is
as
being
imposed
with
me.
do
you
think
if
the
fourth
amendment
is
justifying
no
less
by
for
administrative
warrant,
then
it
is
for
a
warrant
by
a
magistrate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
would
the
administration
have
--
administrative
agents
have
more
right
to
bring
about
the
arrest
of
the
man
under
the
fourth
amendment?
another
circumstance
is
different
to
what
the
courts
--
through
magistrate
to
him.
i
don't
get
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
fourth
amendment,
it
talks
about
arrest
and
seizure.
it
doesn't
talk
about
punishment,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
seized.
he
is
seized
by
officers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
government
is
--
i
--
i
want
to
get
this
clearly
in
my
own
mind
because
i
have
somewhat
different
ideas
about
this,
the
fact
of
the
search
and
seizure
clause
of
the
constitution
and
some
of
the
--
and
some
of
the
other.
do
i
understand
that
the
government
is
taking
the
position
here
that
administrative
agents
can
issue
warrant
to
seize
a
man
because
they
say
it's
something
administratively
where
they're
not
going
to
punish
him
that
would
--
would
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment,
so
far
the
magistrates
are
concern?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
my
--
when
this
case
came
up,
we
brought
it
here,
i
suppose
the
point
was
the
difference
between
--
if
there
was
any
difference
between
the
fourth
amendment's
requirement
in
connection
with
administrative
arrest
or
--
for
deportation
or
anything
else
and
any
other.
now,
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
you
are
saying
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
you
had
probable
cause
to
make
this
arrest
and
that
the
circumstances
will
not
search
to
make
it
unreasonable
to
go
and
arrest
him
without
going
--
to
go
magistrate.
but
i
do
not
in
my
circuits,
where
you
can
get
much
help
from
this
so-called
administrative
warrant,
nobody
swore
anything.
it
wasn't
before
a
magistrate
and
it
just
--
just
an
order
from
one
superior
to
another
to
go
arrest
the
man
and
seize
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can
understand
that.
if
that's
what
you're
arguing,
then
i
don't
see
whether
the
administrative
warrant
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
if
that's
to
be
given
much
weight,
i
--
i
haven't
yet
seen
--
heard
the
argument
which
justifies
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
go
back
to
the
validity
of
the
arrest
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
a
warrant
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
claim
that
administrative
agent
has
a
right
to
order
somebody
seized
without
going
before
a
magistrate
even
though
there's
ample
time,
nobody
doubts
this
ample
time
that
they
can
go
grab
him
whenever
they
see
fit
without
going
before
magistrate
and
seize
him
and
whisk
him
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you're
going
to
take
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
inclined
as
to
the
forcible
entry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
inclined
as
to
the
forcible
entry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
regulation
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
deported?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
for
the
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
63
and
64
of
the
original
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
purpose
did
it
say?
there's
some
(inaudible)
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
what
just
comes
into
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
subject
to
supervision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
your
argument,
i'm
not
quite
clear
whether
--
if
it's
your
argument
that
when
arrest
of
this
kind
for
this
purpose,
the
rules
that
courts
have
worked
out
with
reference
to
search
and
seizure
as
an
arrest
for
crime
are
equally
applicable
to
this
so
called
arrest
for
deportation
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
then
would
be
--
they
have
a
right
to
search
and
seize
here
under
an
arrest
of
this
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
not
criminal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
weapons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
--
the
criminality,
but
there
is
no
criminality
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
kind
of
a
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
but
--
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
deportation,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
in
the
old
days,
when
they
could
arrest
a
man
to
death,
for
instance?
they
did
arrest
him
for
death?
the
officers
would've
had
the
same
rights
to
search
and
seize
both
what
he
had
in
this
possession
and
all
around
in
his
room
and
house
as
they
would
if
they
arrest
him
for
--
for
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
arrest
him
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
those
are
sufficient
to
give
the
officers
reason
to
believe
he
was
guilty
of
espionage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
1357
(inaudible)
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1357?
