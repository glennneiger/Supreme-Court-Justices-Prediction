mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief

do
they
have
any
kind
of
a
hearing
during
those

weeks?

that

mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
a
different
statute
that
requires
him
to
report
to
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
a
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
misdemeanor
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
statute
run
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
also
the
government
had
in
mind
if
it
would
locate
enough
evidence
of
crime
by
a
search
that
it
would
prosecute
him
for
the
--
the
subversion
even
though
hayhanen
didn't
testify.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donovan,
before
you
--
before
you
sit
down,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
the
service
that
you
have
rendered
to
the
cause
of
justice
by
appearing
for
this
defendant
because
we
understand
the
situation.
he
was
unrepresented
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
judge
requested
the
bar
associations
of
brooklyn
and
of
queens
county
to
recommend
names
of
lawyers
who
were
capable
of
and
who
might
be
willing
to
conduct
the
defense
of
this
man
as
a
public
service
and
not
for
compensation,
that
the
bar
associations
did
recommend
you
that
the
--
that
the
court
appointed
you
that
you
served
during
this
long
and
arduous
trial
in
the
trial
court.
you
pursued
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
this
court.
i
--
i
think
i
can
say
that
in
the
time
i
have
been
on
this
court
that
no
man
is
to
undertake
him
for
that
reason,
for
that
purpose,
a
more
arduous
nor
self-sacrificing
service.
and
we
feel
indebted
to
you
and
to
your
associate,
mr.
debevoise,
for
--
for
having
done
so.
it
gives
us
a
great
feeling
of
comfort
to
know
that
judges,
trial
judges
and
members
of
bar
associations
and
members
of
our
bar
are
willing
to
undertake
this
sort
of
public
service
in
a
type
of
case
which
would
normally
be
offensive
to
them.
we
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
mr.
solicitor
general,
of
course,
as
always,
we
--
we
appreciate
the
--
the
fervent
manners
in
which
you
represent
the
interest
of
the
united
states
of
america.

mr.
donovan,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
memorandum
was
from
the
f.b.i.,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
you
read
this
as
saying
that
where
they're
interested
in
internal
security,
they're
lawless
and
where
they're
interested
in
getting
evidence
for
use
in
court,
they
behave
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
is
that
the
way
you
want
--
want
this
read.
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we
can
--
we
can
relieve
you
of
that
responsibility,
mr.
donovan,
if
you
would
leave
that
with
us,
we'll
--
we
--
we
can
post
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
are
necessary.
thank
you
mr.
donovan.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
before
you
get
to
that,
you
--
you
stated
the
issue
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question.
now,
does
that
include
the
--
the
right
to
the
search
that
was
made
here
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there's
a
legal
--
and
to
the
legal
principle,
as
the
legal
principle
in
this
--
in
this
case,
does
the
administrative
warrant
itself,
support
the
search
that
was
made
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
part
of
this
issue
as
you
have
--
have
stated
it
in
response
to
mr.
frankfurter's
question
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
without
regard
to
whether
it
is
arrest
--
an
arrest
for
a
crime
or
for
deportability
under
--
under
a
warrant
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question
and
i'll
try
not
to
interrupt
you
anymore,
but
does
your
argument
depend
at
all
upon
the
character
of
this
search
as
to
whether
it
was
a
--
a
limited
search
or
as
to
whether
it
was
a
general
search
of
the
premises?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
--
what
was
this?
do
you
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
i'm
talking
about
the
search
now.
all
i'm
interested
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
search.
was
this
a
general
search
or
was
this
a
limited
search?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
can
argue
that
on
your
own
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
to
get
the
point
in
my
--
in
my
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
just
to
get
back
to
the
search
again.
suppose
this
man's
home
instead
of
being
just
one
room
and
one
small
room
and
a
bachelor
has
been
a
10-room
house,
would
this
warrant
have
supported
searching
through
his
entire
home
has
--
that
was
done
with
this
man's
entire
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
well,
let's
take
it
forward
(inaudible)
i
--
i
didn't
pick
that
in
my
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i'm
speaking
of
the
administrative
warrant
to
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
doesn't
that
characterization
of
the
deportation
proceeding
against
is
a
civil
proceeding
cut
both
ways
insofar
as
the
government
arguing
this
concern,
if
it
is
a
civil
proceeding,
would
it
follow
that
the
--
that
it
was
contemplated
that
that
should
be
able
to
--
should
entitle
the
government
to
--
to
eliminate
the
necessity
for
search
warrants
to
arrest
for
a
serious
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
what
--
what
your
thought
would
be
concerning
what
mr.
donovan
suggested
that
if
we
say
that
an
administrative
warrant
of
this
kind
was
adequate
to
support
a
search
such
as
had
been
made
here,
that
it
would
no
longer
be
necessary
for
them
to
use
the
search
procedure,
i
mean,
added
to
the
use
of
search
warrant
procedure
in
any
subversive
cases
involving
aliens.
all
they
have
--
all
they
have
to
do
is
just
issue
--
issue
a
deportation
warrant,
go
in
and
search
the
place
for
--
for
evidence
of
subversion
and
--
and
entirely
avoid
the
search
and
seizure
clause
of
constitution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here,
why
couldn't
--why
couldn't
they
have
said,
“now
you
come
along
with
us
mr.
abel,
we're
going
to
take
you
into
custody
and
then
leave
the
officers
there
and
--
and
get
a
search
warrant
and
search
the
place
in
a
regular
manner.
what
--
what
burden
would
that
put
on
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
(inaudible)
them
in
anyway
by
having
done
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
that
--
that's
--
that's
what
brings
us
all
here
and
this
case
is
taking
a
long
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
time
going
through
all
the
courts
and
--
and
wouldn't
it
have
been
simplified
and
should
have
been
simplified
in
this
--
in
this
situation
by
the
--
by
them
saying,
“well,
we'll
get
a
search
warrant
and
search
this
place.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
had
four
--
you
had
four
officers
there,
did
you
not?
you
had
two
fbi
officers
and
two
--
two
immigration
officers.
you
had
just
one
man
involved
and
he
was
--
he
was
under
arrest.
if
you
had
taken
him
out
of
the
room
and
any
place,
any
place
you
wanted
to
take
him
after
he
was
under
arrest,
how
could
anything
has
happened
while
he
was
getting
searched
with
the
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
did
handcuff
him
even
when
he
was
there
right
in
the
room,
what
could
it
--
they
have
done
with
four
officers
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
entry
into
the
room
of
the
fbi
agents?
did
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
have
--
did
they
go
in
to
execute
that
warrant,
the
administrative
warrant
or
did
they
just
force
their
way
into
the
room
as
being
argued
by
mr.
donovan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
used
a
little
stronger
language
than
that,
didn't
they?
didn't
they
say
they
forced
their
way
in
--
or
--
or
perhaps
pushed
their
way
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pushed
their
way
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
was
before
--
this
was
before
you
--
you
did
anything
to
execute
the
--
the
deportation
warrant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
you
base
--
then
you
base
your
argument
not
on
the
--
on
the
--
the
warrant
of
deportation,
but
on
the
knowledge
that
the
fbi
agents
had
when
they
pushed
their
way
into
the
room,
was
that
a
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
you
have
to
--
you
rely
on
--
on
the
knowledge
they
have
and
the
information
they
have
at
the
time
they
knocked
on
the
door
and
pushed
their
way
into
the
room.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
wasn't
being
executed
at
the
time.
those
people
were
deliberately
left
at
a
distance
away
from
--
from
him
and
it
was
only
after
they
have
arrested
the
man
that
they
went
--
went
and
told
that
the
immigration
people,
“now
you
can
--
you
can
come
in
with
your
warrant,”
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
how
long?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
--
could
have
left
anytime
he
wanted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
before
the
--
the
other
warrant
was
executed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
the
administrative
warrant
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
the
one
that
i
was
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
items
--
general,
were
the
items
they
took
from
the
waste
basket,
did
it
take
them
in
the
course
of
the
search
or
in
the
course
of
helping
him
pack
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donovan,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
