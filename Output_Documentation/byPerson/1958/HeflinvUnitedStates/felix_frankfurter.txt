how
big
a
record
is
it?
justice
felix

that
wouldn't
be
a
jury
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wouldn't
be
a
jury
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
take
special
verdict,
unless
you
--
unless
the
facts
were
in
dispute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
he
given
under
(d)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
you
--
that's
because
you're
not
even
younger
than
you
really
are
so
--
that
you
have
been
later
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
later,
you
would
have.[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
may
i
ask
this
question?
if
i
understood
your
answer,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you're
happily
aren't
confronted
with
the
problem
of
robbery
one
day,
secreting
the
loot
and
then
coming
back
a
month
later
or
a
week
later
and
disposing
of
it?
you're
not
confronted
with
that
question
you
say,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
you
are
confronted
with
that
question,
well,
not
explicitly
because
of
your
claim
that
(d)
applies
to
somebody
else
but
not
the
robber.
you
say
you
partly
rely
on
the
caption
and
you
say
that
--
that
(c)
deals
with
another
person
than
--
than
the
other
fellow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thereby
--
i
should
think
--
i
suppose
it's
right,
you're
not
confronted
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
you're
right
about
that,
then
the
answer
ought
to
be
simple.
if
it's
the
same
person,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
same
day
or
two
weeks
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see,
i
see.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
make
--
you
make
two
arguments,
as
i
understand
it,
that
(c)
only
applies
to
a
person
other
than
the
robber.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
two,
that
if
words
like
receive,
possess
or
conceal,
stores,
barters,
sells
or
disposes
maybe
applied
to
the
robber,
there
must
be
some
discontinuity
in
the
--
in
the
activity
involved,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
--
that
wouldn't
apply
to
robbing
today
and
getting
away
with
the
loot
to
extent,
i
mean
your
argument
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
say
even
though,
you
don't
even
argue.
you
stand
on
that
proposition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
comprehensively
and
you
don't
even
fear
assuming
it
could
be
applied
to
this
situation,
it
doesn't
--
the
record
here
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
shows
an
organic
single
thing
contemporaneously
transpired.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
--
if
you
concede
in
your
position,
you
will
be
going
beyond
what
you're
doing
for
this
fellow,
you'll
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
have
to
construe
the
statute,
don't
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
under
--
a
motion
under
rule
35
brought
before
the
concededly
valid
terms
whether
or
not
he
is
in
confinement,
a
concededly
valid
term,
he
brings
--
applies
under
rule
35
for
the
exertion
of
an
allegedly
illegal
extension
of
that
term
if
and
when
it
expired
for
the
district
judge
deny
that
motion,
is
that
appealable?
is
that
a
final
judgment
or
appealable?
i
should
think
it's
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
we
--
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
review
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
just
wondering
--
i'm
just
interested
whether
because
that
makes
it
less
than
a
--
i
should
think
that,
i
maybe
all
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
final
judgment.
i
don't
think
it
would
happen
anyhow
until
the
fellow's
full
term
has
expired
(inaudible)
2255
or
--
or
on
the
other
hand,
it
might
be
argued
that
it's
the
motion,
since
rule
35
is
intended
to
serve
some
purpose,
perhaps,
the
ability
is
implied.
however,
we
haven't
got
the
proper
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
when
you
say
they
had
a
prototype,
you
are
implying
a
process
of
rationality
to
congressional
legislation
that
i
wish
were
justified,
but
i
don't
think
is,
i
don't
know
anything
about
your
statute
except
what
you
told
me
and
the
35
stat.
that
means
somewhere
1900
and
whatever
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
9,
somewhere
around
there,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you've
got
a
statute
passed
some
30
years
before,
at
least
30
years
before,
coming
out
of,
the
lord
knows
what,
committee
of
the
congress,
framed
by,
the
lord
knows,
what
draftsman
and
when
you
say
prototype,
you
assume
that
congress
dealt
with
this
problem
in
1940,
the
draftsman
of
this
committee
has
that
before
it
and
said,
“ah,
this
is
my
example
i
shall
not
follow.”
that's
a
--
that's
a
little
too
irrational,
what
goes
on
under
hill,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
not
think
(inaudible)
argument
is
that
you
don't
read
any
statute
that
i
do
not
know
maybe
criminal
statute
literally
just
as
a
matter
of
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
in
connection
with
this,
he
gave
it.
he
says
this
contemplates
the
first
(inaudible)
not
the
original
robbery.
you
are
going
to
tell
us
why
the
legislative
history
(inaudible)
aren't
you?
that's
what
you
have
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
making
a
jump
there?
it
means
--
it
means
saying
that
the
attorney
general
recommended
that
congress
exceeded
his
recommendations.
we
had
a
separate
substantive
offense,
we
still
have
to
decide
what
the
scope
of
the
offense
is
which
they
created.
and
automatically,
it
doesn't
follow
that
--
doesn't
reject
the
view
that
the
new
section
dealt
with
recipient
of
loot,
that
there
was
already
enough
--
there
were
enough
penal
provision,
penal
feature
being
with
the
perpetrators
of
--
of
the
--
getting
the
loot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
the
fact
you
emphasize
--
you
emphasize
very
strongly
that
(inaudible)
that
congress
meant
to
create
a
new
substantive
offense.
the
attorney
general
said
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
they
have
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
they
have
a
regular
meaning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
national
--
take
the
national
stolen
property
act,
what
is
quoted,
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
a
u.s.c.
title
18,
section
460
(inaudible)
that
must
be
different
from
your
1940
101,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
section
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
section,
416,
and
the
federal
kidnapping
act,
18
section
408
(a)
and
(c)
(1).
was
the
proposal
of
the
attorney
general
jackson
based
on
legislation
then
on
the
books
for
all
practical
purposes,
it
then
would
be
a
prototype
for
all
practical
purposes
as
(d)
is
now
phrased
which
had
been
construed
by
court
to
include
as
a
disclosure
the
original
purpose,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
your
brief,
i
take
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
documents
--
documents
the
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
construe
legislation
and
you're
arguing
that
when
the
attorney
general
opposes
legislation
to
fill
a
gap
which
he
found
to
have
been
filled
in
other
domains
of
national
concern.
presumably
he
took
along
the
construction
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
attorney
general
cummings
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
the
prime
mover
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
do
that
and
--
and
perhaps
before
the
hour
is
up,
i
--
i
need
your
help,
mr.
gilinsky.
i
now
looked
at
the
two
sections
to
which
attorney
general
jackson
refers
in
his
letter,
namely,
the
national
stolen
property
act
and
the
lindbergh
act,
i
find
that
this
section
(c)
which
is,
as
i
understand,
what
he
submitted
and
what
was
passed,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
sudden
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sudden
--
sudden
condemnation.
i
find
that
416
and
408
respectively
have
difference
but
he
is
taking
--
he
has
clubbed
all
the
verbs
from
the
two
sections.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
that
is
--
my
point
is
that
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
that
there
were
rulings
certainly
in
the
lower
court
under
408
(c)
and
416
respectively
and
with
the
chief
justice's
permission
i
would
like
very
much
if
you
could
submit
a
memorandum
indicating
what
decisions
there
were
which
construed
those
two
respective
sections.
all
of
which
was
then
compounded
into
present
(c).
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
dyer
act
is
the
parent
of
the
national
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
stolen
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
said
(inaudible)
under
the
dyer
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which,
presumably
(inaudible)
that
was
taking
your
words
(inaudible)
does
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
fair
--
they
could
say
that
the
encrustation
of
the
decision
under
the
dyer
act
would
apply
to
the
stolen
act
and
therefore,
your
argument
is
to
this
act.
now,
what
about
the
lindbergh
act,
any
decision
under
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
--
so
that
we
would
have
to
decide
--
we
may
have
to
decide
in
the
future
whether
a
group
of
kidnappers
(inaudible)
finally
get
a
ransom
of
$50,000.
one
of
them
does
all
the
operating
and
they
then
divide
the
$50,000
whether
they
could
be
convicted
both
for
the
attempted
kidnapping,
assuming
there
was
no
death,
as
i
happily
assume,
and
also
under
408
(c)
for
the
disposition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
that
--
we
--
we
have
to
construe
that,
wouldn't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
so
that
--
so
that
--
unless
the
dyer
or
national
stolen
property
act
helps
you
out
a
little,
we
still
have
the
problem
of
what
the
--
of
what
the
meaning
of
the
two
statutes
relied
upon
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
dyer
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
well,
are
--
those
are
the
only
ones
then
and
they
are
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
are
all
in
your
brief.
are
they
all
set
forth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
then
readily
available
in
--
in
the
department?
i
mean
(inaudible)
you
could
have
a
memorandum
tomorrow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
--
all
right,
i
thought
you
might
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
hold?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
listen
--
but
you're
quite
right
in
saying
that
and
there
is
language
in
hayman
which
justifies
you,
but
the
great
point
that
is
decisive,
importance
of
2255
is
the
one
that
you
just
indicated,
namely,
that
the
matter
should
be
brought
before
the
sentencing
court
and
not
where
the
man
is
detained.
and
i
suggest
that
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
not
--
is
not
foreclose
by
the
talk
or
what
said
in
hayman,
in
that
you
have
got
a
different
situation
that
2255
isn't
habeas
corpus,
it
doesn't
require
custody
of
the
person.
so
that
if
we
have
--
if
we
--
if
a
problem
of
not
releasing
from
custody,
which
is
what
habeas
corpus
would
mean,
habeas
corpus
would
mean
he
is
let
out.
2255
doesn't
mean
such
thing
at
the
time.
it's
a
declaration
of
rights
in
a
way,
isn't
it?
and
therefore,
i
think
the
point
that
justice
whittaker
raises
is
of
detention,
whether
a
rule
which
you
rightly
say
was
the
rule
under
habeas
corpus
isn't
affected
by
the
difference,
the
--
the
important
difference
that
2255
introduced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute,
you
mean
2255?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cooper,
i
--
i
think
you
do
well
to
take
the
vigorous
line
that
you
are
taking
on
this
point.
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
other
hand,
in
view
of
the
still
cloudy
condition
in
which
the
construction
or
the
scope
of
2255
remains,
what
this
court
said
and
what
it
didn't
say
in
hayman,
etcetera,
etcetera,
the
only
way
of
--
of,
perhaps,
getting
a
rationale
and
a
clear
system
for
practice
or
ruling
in
this
deal
is
for
the
government
to
raise
these
questions
instead
of
leaving
it
all
to
--
to
laxity
and
to
oversight
or
--
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
aren't
troubled
if
the
trouble
isn't
put
before
them,
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
--
if
the
cases
don't
bear
out,
as
i
understood
to
be
the
government's
claim,
that
it
had
been
the
settled
construction
of
the
dyer
act
that
a
thief,
that
he
is
also
through
an
independent
act
of
concealment,
not
inherent
in
(inaudible)
be
punished,
subject
to
punishment
if
the
cases
don't
bear
that
out
as
--
as
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
--
if
they
do,
then
there's
a
very
serious
question,
as
least
to
my
mind,
when
the
attorney
general
makes
a
suggestion,
asks
congress
to
pass
a
statute
based
on
other
statutes
derived
from
a
series
of
rulings,
although
he
doesn't
disclose
it,
he
would
say
undisclosed,
one
knows
how
the
attorney
general
and
particularly
this
one
operated.
this
is
a
suggestion
that
was
made
to
him
by
the
criminal
division
of
the
department.
they
refer
to
past
statutes,
any
lawyer
except
a
stupid
or
a
lax
one,
in
dealing
with
a
statute
would
consider
the
instructions
given
to
that
statute
and
therefore,
there
is
a
gloss
put
on
it
by
prior
decisions.
now,
if
there
is
no
such
gloss,
then
--
then
you
are
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
argumentatively
--
it's
argumentatively
persuasive
but
the
fact
is
that
captions
of
legislation
very
often
only
give
one
part
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
you
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
