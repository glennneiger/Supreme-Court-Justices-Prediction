petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
cooper,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
only
one
that's
in
issue
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilinsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
helpful
legislative
history
on
--
on
the
national
stolen
property
act
or
the
federal
kidnapping
act,
mr.
gilinsky?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
there
to
show
whether
these
--
these
two
acts
were
--
were
enacted
to
apply
to
offenses
rather
as
--
as
to
where
it
is
in
the
underworld
as
distinguished
from
the
thieves
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
gilinsky,
it's
your
theory
as
--
that
the
moment
that
the
robber
scoops
up
the
money
in
the
bank
that
he
commits
two
crimes
in
that
--
at
that
precise
moment,
he
both
took
and
received
the
money.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
then
--
where
then
is
the
dividing
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
you've
got
--
i
don't
think
it's
exactly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
on
the
facts
not
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
same
but
can
you
answer
that
precise
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
of
course.
no
questions
that
if
the
government
wanted
to
do
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
especially
that
the
congress
did
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
--
where
in
this
case,
mr.
gilinsky,
would
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
receiving
entered
into
--
into
the
case
of
this
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think,
then
he
--
then
how
could
he
committed
that
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
sold
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
you
conceive
of
a
man
who
--
who
robs
a
bank,
who
doesn't,
at
the
same
time,
have
the
--
the
impulse
to
--
to
conceal
the
--
the
property
that
he
steals
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
the
precise
moment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
think
it's
that
by
--
isn't
the
most
evading
instinct,
the
most
evading
impulse
of
the
man
when
he
stills
it
to
take
it
for
himself
and
keep
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
--
it
isn't
collateral
thing,
it's
--
it's
not
something
he
doesn't
think
through.
he
does
it
because
he
wants
it
for
himself
when
he
takes
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
in
the
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case
do
you
consider
the
concealment
to
have
started?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
--
you
don't
think
they
didn't
take
the
same
trouble
to
conceal
it
when
they
took
it
to
this
place
where
they
divided
up
an
hour
later?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
purpose
of
concealing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
in
your
--
under
your
theory,
did
they
catch
him
--
a
robber
immediately
after
the
robbery
is
committed
one
crime
but
they
don't
get
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
years
committed
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he's
--
he's
concealed
it
for
a
year
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
--
as
you
say
and
if
that's
--
if
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
evidence
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
rely
on
for
concealment,
you
say
the
things
that
happened
right
afterwards
don't
count
if
--
so
--
since
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
main
factor
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
what
acts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course,
there's
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
cite
your
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cooper,
the
--
we've
arrived
at
adjournment
time
but
if
would
you
like
to
finish
tonight,
we'd
be
very
glad
to
accommodate
you
under
the
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
well,
no,
you
--
you
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
as
you
please.
we'll
be
willing
to
hear
you
now
if
--
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
take.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.

mr.
cooper,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cooper
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
thanks
for
the
services
that
you
have
rendered
in
this
particular
case.
we
know
it
took
some
sacrifice
to
you.
and
i
--
i
can't
help
thinking
of
the
fact
that,
as
i
stated
in
an
earlier
case,
that
in
this
week's
argument,
there
are
four
people
who
are
unable
to
come
to
this
court,
although
they
are
totally
without
means
because
of
the
public
spiritedness
of
lawyers
who
are
willing
without
compensation
that
the
assignment
of
this
in
other
courts
to
conduct
their
defenses
for
them,
and
we
are
deeply
grateful
for
it.
thank
you.
and
thank
you,
mr.
gilinsky,
for
your
able
representation
of
the
government
in
this
matter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
indeed.
