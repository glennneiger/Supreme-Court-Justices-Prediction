justice

with
respect
to
the
prince
case,
what
if
the
man
who
enters
the
bank,
national
or
federally
insured
bank
today,
then
robbing
the
bank
and
for
some
reason,
his
plans
go
arise,
so
he
walks
out
of
the
bank
and
then
he
and
his
confederate
plan
to
do
this
whole
thing
all
over
again
the
next
week,
he
enters
the
bank
and
this
time,
he's
successful
in
robbing
it,
suppose
proof
of
all
that
under
the
prince
case,
is
that
still
all
you
want
to
(inaudible)
don't
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
omitting
that
question
to
your
case,
the
present
case,
what
if
the
man
robs
a
bank
today
and
hides
the
money
for
a
week,
for
a
month
and
then
disposes
them,
would
he
then
be
guilty
of
a
separate
offence
under
subsection
(c)
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unless,
they
prove
that
it's
loot
--
it's
been
stolen
on
receipt
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
a
month
later
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
say
that
we
don't
need
to
answer
that
question
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gilinsky
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gilinsky,
the
risk
of
confusing
two
separate
issues
in
this
case,
two
separate
arguments,
may
i
ask
you
this?
is
there
any
language
in
either
the
--
in
the
dyer
act
or
the
national
stolen
property
act
or
in
the
so-called
lindbergh
receivers
part
of
that
act,
similar
to
the
language
that
we
have
here
imposing
by
reference
the
punishment
provided
by
another
subdivision
for
the
taker?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
point
is
--
and
your
point
is
just
like
--
let's
see
if
i
have
it,
that
these
other
statutes
do
not
have
this
language
in
it,
this
language
as
you
say
did
not
come
until
the
re-codification
of
the
law
because
in
these
other
statutes,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
--
in
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
dependent
upon
the
amount,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
usually
transportation.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
in
answer
to
the
question
i
originally
asked
you,
i
--
the
answer
i
expect
is
no.the
other
statutes
do
not
have
this
language
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
is
--
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
his
argument
is
a
little
different.
wasn't
it
that
the
government
had
to
take
its
choice
between
these
sections?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
a
mere
suggestion
though,
isn't
it,
on
the
part
of
the
government?
isn't
that
--
hasn't
that
been
the
square
holding
of,
at
least,
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
unlike
factual
issues
that
juries
are
called
upon
everyday
to
determine,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
we
can
understand
what
the
legal
test
is
under
the
statute
and
then
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
find
out
what
the
facts
are.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
another
case,
you
might
get
an
acquittal
and
there
would
be
no
punishment
at
all.that
happens
every
day,
doesn't
it?
