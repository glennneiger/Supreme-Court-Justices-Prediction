mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
this
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
there
is
a
preliminary
question
for
decision
which
i
feel
obligated
to
call
to
this
court's
attention
before
i
discuss
the
matters
of
multiple
sentencing
here.
very
briefly,
petitioner
has
filed
a
motion
under
either
2255
or
rule
35.
very
briefly,
it
is
the
government's
position
that
under
either
case,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
matter.
under
2255,
we
feel
that
this
is
an
outgrowth
of
habeas
corpus.
as
such
and
as
the
statute,
itself,
notes
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we
did
not
raise
this
in
the
district
court
in
those
terms
and
it
was
not
raised
in
those
terms
in
the
appellate
court.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
makes
any
difference
on
jurisdiction
because
mcnally
versus
hill
upon
which
we
rely
also
very
clearly
noted
that
the
jurisdictional
question
was
not
raised
below.
under
2255,
it's
premature
because
he
is
presently
in
custody
under
an
admittedly
valid
10-year
sentence
to
be
followed
by
a
sentence
which
he
is
not
contesting
of
three
years
or
a
total
of
13
years,
that
he
is
uncontesting
here,
to
be
followed
by
the
year
and
a
day
sentence
which
he
is
presently
arguing
about.
therefore,
under
habeas
corpus
as
well
as
well
as,
we
believe,
under
2255,
since
he
cannot
be
released
from
custody,
he
has
no
standard
either
in
habeas
corpus
or
2255
to
bring
this
type
of
motion
under
that
section.
under
rule
35,
which
is
unrelated,
as
we
feel,
to
the
question
of
custody,
however,
is
a
rule
of
a
federal
criminal
procedure
and
has
so
been
held
by
this
court.
as
such,
if
this
is
under
rule
35
where
we
think
most
probably
this
type
of
matter
lies,
he
is
also
late
in
coming
to
this
court
because
he
has
filed
an
untimely
petition
for
certiorari.
i
say
parenthetically
that
this
is
no
fault
of
his
present
counsel
because
his
present
counsel
was
not
in
the
case,
so
the
fact
that
he
is
late,
however,
is
not
to
be
relegated
to
his
present
attorney,
nevertheless,
he
is
late.
as
such,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
then.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
can
go
back
and
make
a
motion
all
over
again
under
rule
35.
that
is
true.
that
does
not
--
i
assume
that
is
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
your
honor
please.
i
--
i
believe
it's
a
little
more
than
rigmarole.
the
petitioner
here
has
already
gone
through,
for
example,
a
rigmarole
because
what
he
has
done
here
is
sought
review
of
a
1955
ruling
by
starting
all
over
again.
in
1955,
at
the
court
of
appeals,
he
directly
attacked
exactly
the
same
thing
he
is
attacking
now,
and
he
got
partial
relief.
he
didn't
seek
review
of
that.
but
what
he
did
was
go
through
the
rigmarole
of
starting
all
over
again
by
--
and
incidentally,
consolidating
his
gains,
he
started
all
over
again
in
the
district
court
with
a
2255,
rule
35.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
practice
which
has
gone
through.
i
think
it
also
possibly
has
some
merits
however
because
after
all,
this
is
a
rule
of
this
court,
supreme
court
rule
of
30
days.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
i
have
difficulty
with
it.
but
i
do
know
this,
that
that
is
what
happened
in
prince,
so
that
it
did
get
here.
in
prince,
if
this
court
will
recall,
the
court
--
the
district
court
considered
the
motion
under
rule
35
in
this
court's
opinion
in
prince,
very
carefully,
i
--
at
least,
i
thought,
noted
that
that
was
a
motion
under
rule
35.
also,
i
should
mention,
although
it's
not
in
our
brief,
holiday
versus
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
pardon
me.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
this
court
once
had
(inaudible)
which
had
this
problem.
and
while
it
doesn't
deal
directly
with
this
issue
that
you
raised
--
treated
it,
and
--
so
i
--
i
can't
answer
any
further
on
that
--
on
that
point.
but
i
--
i
feel
called
upon
at
least
to
bring
either
of
these
to
this
court's
attention.
lest,
however,
as
we
say,
petitioner
be
mislead
into
thinking
that
an
otherwise
meritorious
contention
which
first
was
turned
down
in
1955
is
again
rejected
solely
because
of
some
procedural
defect
--
defect
which
he
has
been
noted,
he
can
start
all
over
again.
we
submit
that
petitioner's
great
reliance
upon
the
prince
decision,
the
facts
or
the
legislative
history
therein
is
in
this
context
misplaced
and
this
bring
us
to
the
second
issue,
whether
one,
who
has
successfully
consummated
a
bank
robbery
of
a
bank
which
either
is
insured
by
the
united
states
or
is
a
national
bank,
can
then
proceed
to
conceal
for
future
use
or
dispose
of
the
fruits
of
this
crime
to
the
detriment,
obviously,
of
the
united
states
without
any
fear
of
prosecution
or
punishment
for
such
further
separate
activity.
and
this
--
there
are
two
very
clear
points
to
be
made,
we
feel.
usually
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
insists
upon
a
strict
construction
of
the
penal
statute.
we
feel
that
what
the
petitioner
here
desires
is
to
the
contrary.
he
wishes
to
write
into
subsection
(c)
an
exception
to
the
fact
that
he
was
the
bank
robber.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court,
and
this
is
not
what
congress
did
in
the
statute,
he
used
all
inclusive
language
and
they
did
not
write
in
the
exception
that
this
property
must
be
first
stolen
by
any
other
person.
now,
i
go
further
in
this
case
or
we
can
always
imagine
and
figure
out
words
to
be
placed
in
statute
to
create
a
favorable
situation.
in
this
particular
instance,
however,
congress
did
have
a
prototype.
now,
this,
unfortunately,
is
not
in
our
brief
but
we
feel
that
because
of
what
has
been
discussed
in
regard
to
what
language
could
go
into
statutes,
it
is
very
necessary
that
we
call
this
to
the
court's
attention.
in
1940
when
this
statute
was
passed,
there
was
on
the
books,
title
18
united
states
code,
1946
edition,
101
also
35
statute
1098.
now,
i
emphasize
the
1946
code
because
it
has
been
subsequently
changed.
but
in
other
words,
this
statute
that
i
have
now
cited
was
on
the
books
in
1940
when
subsection
(c)
was
added
to
the
bank
robbery
statute.
now,
this
section
held
in
connection
with
the
theft
of
government
property
in
regard
to
the
receiver
and
it
had
this
wording,
“whoever
shall
receive,
conceal
and
so
forth,”
the
typical
wording,
“with
intent
to
convert
to
his
own
use
and
so
forth,
any
money
property
and
so
forth
of
the
united
states
which
has
heretofore
been
embezzled,
stolen
or
purloined
by
any
other
person,
by
any
other
person,”
i
emphasize,
“knowing
the
same
have
been
embezzled
and
so
forth
shall
be
punished.”
in
other
words,
what
we
are
saying
to
this
court
is
what
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
write
into
subsection
(c)
of
the
bank
robbery
statute,
whoever
does
these
things
with
money
which
has
been
stolen
by
some
other
person
shall
be
punished
and
so
forth,
but
we
suggest
not
only
is
that
not
what
was
done
by
congress
but
we
further
suggest
that
if
that
was
what
they
wanted
to
do,
if
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do,
they
have
the
prototype
at
the
time
in
the
context
of
not
just
transporting,
which
gets
to
another
jurisdictional
constitutional
problem,
but
in
the
context
of
theft
which
is
what
we
have
in
the
bank
robbery
statute.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
1909.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that
--
it
was
in
before
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
agree
that
that
is
not
the
type
of
thing
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
not
what
happened.
so
i
mean
we
don't
have
to
speculate
because
i
think
the
legislative
history,
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
is
much
clear
than
that,
so
we
don't
have
to
speculate.
this
--
this
was
not
said
in
so
many
words,
as
i
am
saying.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
is
what
the
petitioner
is
reading
the
statute
to
read,
and
i
am
saying
that
in
the
usual
criminal
case,
it's
just
the
opposite.
he
doesn't
want
to
have
anybody
change
any
words.
he
wants
to
read
it
as
it
is.
and
i
suggest
as
it
is,
as
it
is,
it
covers
“whoever”
and
as
such,
covers
bank
robber
and
anyone
else.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
am
going
to
come
not
quite
in
that
context
but
it
will
come
close.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
did
not.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
will
give
it
again
to
you.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh,
i
--
i
did
not
say
it
in
brief.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
sir.
this
statute
--
first
i
give
the
united
states
code,
it's
1946
edition,
18
united
states
code
101,
35
statutes
1098.
this,
by
the
way,
is
now
18
united
states
code
641.
it
does
not
contain
that
language.
i
move
on
to
the
legislative
history
because
i
think
this
also
is
not
as
simple
as
petitioner
would
have
this
court
believe
and
does
not
lead
us
into
the
same
type
of
problem
that
prince
led
us
into.
the
legislative
history
of
this
subsection
is
brief
but
it
is
very
much
to
the
point.
it
is
based
almost
entirely,
almost
entirely
upon
a
letter
which
was
sent
by
the
then
attorney
general
to
both
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate.
there
was
no
debate
on
the
floor
of
the
house
or
the
senate.
there
were
no
amendments
made
to
the
proposal.
i
can
find
no
discussion
of
it.
we
are
therefore
left
with
solely
this
letter,
which,
by
the
way,
composes
almost
the
whole
of
the
report
of
the
senate
and
composes
almost
the
whole
of
the
report
of
the
house.
in
this
letter,
which
we
have
set
out
for
the
greater
part
on
page
15
and
16
of
our
brief,
the
court
will
note
that
one
thing
--
that
certain
things
are
made
very
clear.
first
of
all,
the
letter
clearly
called
for
a
separate
substantive
offense
in
specific
language,
it
called
for
that
and
i
assume
that's
what
it
meant,
number
one.
number
two,
unlike
prince,
this
was
not
a
problem
that
arose
because
somebody
got
into
a
bank
that
they
weren't
able
to
convict
him
of.
this
clearly
came
from
two
other
statutes,
the
wording
of
--
of
the
bank
robbery
receiving
statute,
in
other
words,
clearly
came
from
the
national
stolen
property
act
and
the
ransom
provision
in
the
federal
kidnapping
act.
i
say
“clearly
came”
because
the
present
statute
contains
seven
verbs
and
the
only
way
you
can
get
them
is
to
put
these
two
together.
but
the
legislative
history
clearly
says
that's
where
they
got
this
provision.
i
should
also
mention
at
this
time
then
in
order
to
relate
it
to
the
previous
case
that
there
is
also
no
question
that
the
national
stolen
property
act
wording
came
directly
from
the
dyer
act.
so
what
we
have,
what
we
have
in
this
section
are
a
series
of
words
which,
i
assume,
have
some
meaning
then
in
relation
to
theft
of
cars,
transportation
of
cars,
interstate
transportation
of
other
property
and
securities
in
relation
to
the
disposition
of
ransom
money
and
although
it's
not
mentioned
here,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
same
provision
is
also
involved
in
receiving
stolen
cattle.
and
there
are
numerous
others
federal
statutes,
in
other
words,
that
have
exactly
the
same
meaning.
now,
this
becomes
important
in
this
sense.
this
statute,
subsection
(c)
was
passed
in
1904.
the
bank
robbery
provisions
which
this
court
considered
in
prince
were
substantially
completed
by
1937
with
almost
all
their
amendments.
this
came
in,
in
other
word,
at
a
separate
time
and
at
a
time
when
these
same
words,
these
same
words
in
the
context
of
some
of
these
other
acts
had
--
we
believe
already
had
a
uniform
consistent
interpretation.
in
other
words,
by
1940,
for
example,
there
was
no
question,
at
least
it
had
not
been
raised
as
a
question
which
had
been
cited
adverse
to
the
government
that
the
transporter
as
well
as
the
receiver
could
be
the
same
person
under
the
dyer
act.
as
such,
we
suggest
then,
if
these
are
the
same
words,
and
it's
such
a
much
later
date
and
written
and
suggested
coming
from
attorney
general
who
we
suggest
most
probably
knew
of
these
other
cases,
then
if
we
read
anything
from
this,
as
to
intent
of
the
legislation,
we
suggest
it
should
be
read
that
they
intended,
that
they
intended
then
that
both
sections
could
apply
to
the
same
one
and
the
same
person.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
agree
with
what
you
have
said.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
--
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
made
an
extra
jump
because
to
my
mind
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
as
i
--
i
thought
i
mentioned.
maybe
this
is
not
an
answer.
at
the
time,
i
don't
mean
to
be
repeating
but
i
am
not
sure,
at
the
time
i
feel
these
words
did
have
a
regular
meaning
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
1940.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
because
there
were
a
number
of
cases
by
1940.
in
other
words
what
i
am
saying
is
that
by
1940,
when
this
section
came
in,
there
were
already
a
number
of
cases
which
had
been
decided
under
the
similar
wording
in
these
other
statutes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
is.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
but
it
is
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
sir.
but
it
is.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
that's
what
i
am
saying.
but
i
am
saying
it
a
little
further
because
i
must
go
one
more
step
and
that
is
i
have
said
that
the
national
stolen
property
act
in
turn
came
directly
from
the
dyer
act.
now,
the
dyer
act
is
the
one
that
was
involved
in
the
woody
case.
but
i
say
that
because
by
1940,
the
bulk
of
the
cases
are
obviously
transportation
of
stolen
motor
vehicle
rather
than
of
securities.
but
i
say
this,
that
by
1940,
it
was
a
consistent
and
only
one
that
the
perpetrator
of
the
transportation
could
be
the
same
person
who
also
could
be
charged
and
convicted
as
the
receiver.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
cites
on
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
on
page
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
we
cite
from
three
jurisdictions,
court
of
appeals,
at
various
times
before
1940
what
we
think
are
representative
examples.
and
i
--
i
can't
say
that
i
checked
every
case
but
all
that
i
have
read,
i
find
that
this
is
the
consistent
position.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
will
recognize
that
we
have
gone
still
further
and
said
that
even
up
to
now
and
as
many
courts
have
understood
there
has
still
been
no
radical
change
from
this
in
these
transportation
and
receiving
cases
that
should
have
bothered
any
one
up
to
now.
so
that
certainly,
by
--
by
1940,
what
i
am
saying
is,
a
construction
had
been
put
on
these
words,
and
the
attorney
general,
i
assume
and
i
--
i
think
should
assume
this,
knew
that.
and
when
he
recommended
these
words
and
directly
from
these
statute
he
says
so
that
that's
what
he
meant
at
least.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
not
as
far
as
i
could
find
that
is
helpful
in
the
context
of
our
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
statutes
of
the
national
stolen
property
act
as
well
as
kidnapping
came
in
at
a
time,
i
believe
it's
1934,
when
there
were
a
number
of
anti-gangster
statutes,
i
believe
they
were
called.
and
as
i
recall,
there
were
seven
or
eight
various
acts
which
were
put
in
all
at
one
time
in
this
one
period.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
and
if
this
court
will
recall,
that
--
that
was
the
background
of
these
two
statutes,
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
national
stolen
property
act
came
from
the
dyer
act,
that
is
the
motor
vehicle
which
is
much
older
because
all
the
way
through
that
history,
they
say
that
all
we
are
doing
is
extending
the
dyer
act
to
the
national
stolen
property
situation.
i
might
say
here
there
is
good
reason
to
suppose
that
the
attorney
general
wasn't
--
could
not
get
at
the
same
result
by
using
the
national
stolen
property
act.
although
in
a
typical
bank
robbery
case
are
--
there
is
no
doubt,
i
suppose,
that
in
an
ordinary
run,
there
is
an
interstate
transportation
also
so
that
they
would
have
another
receiver
clause
that
he
could
have
used.
although,
i
think
it's
clear
that
what
he
wanted
here
was
something
that
was
not
limited
by
an
interstate
jurisdictional
problem,
one.
and
two,
they
didn't
want
to
have
any
limitation
as
to
amount
which
the
national
stolen
property
act
has
a
limitation
on
in
order
to
avoid
every
offense
that
goes
across
state
lines.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
i
better
explain
if
we
go
back
a
little
bit
and
explain
how
this
gets
in
there
first.
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
that
might
explain
it.
this
is
another
part
of
legislative
history.
the
act
--
subsection
(c),
as
originally
passed,
did
not
have
this
language
in
it.
now,
we
have
set
this
out
also
in
our
brief.
it
had
a
separate
penalty
clause,
unrelated
to
this
question
and
the
taker.
in
1948,
in
the
general
codification
of
the
whole
criminal
code,
a
number
of
changes
were
made
in
all
--
in
other
sections
including
this
section.
the
thought
being
to
make
a
uniformity
of
punishment,
in
other
words,
the
reason
this
word
gets
in
there
now
at
least
as
far
as
we
can
see
is
this.
prior
to
this
--
to
the
1948
re-codification,
there
was
a
possibility,
you
see,
under
the
change
in
the
robbery
provision
that
a
difference
in
amount
robbed
could
lead
to
different
sentences.
this
was
not
in
the
receiving
clause
because
it
had
its
own
penalty
provision.
as
explained
in
not
only
this
statute
but
in
all
the
others
in
the
attempt
to
make
uniformity
without
separately
spelling
out
the
uniformity,
this
was
one
of
the
means.
in
other
words,
to
put
this
phrase
in
then
made
it
so
that
whoever
receives
and
so
forth
under
this
amount
will
not
be
punished
by
the
greater
penalty.
that
--
now,
we
don't
think
it
has
--
makes
one
--
helps
one
way
or
the
other.
and
we
further
cite
in
our
--
in
our
brief
but
we
--
we
suggest
that
at
the
time
of
the
1948
codification,
not
only
in
the
report,
but
on
the
floor,
senator
taft
asked
the
question
of
what
--
what
is
this
huge
bill?
is
there
any
real
changes
in
here?
and
he
was
told
that
in
the
1948
codification,
the
intent
of
congress
was
not
to
change
the
purpose,
not
to
change
the
purpose
of
any
of
this
legislature.
whatever
we
can
draw
from,
we
suggest
that
the
words
in
the
penalty
clause
now
do
not
help
us
one
way
or
the
other
in
regard
to
construction
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
present
statute
is.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they
mean
this.
they
mean
that
whoever
receives,
disposes,
conceals
and
so
forth
shall
be
punished
depending
upon
the
amount,
depending
upon
the
amount
that
he
disposes,
conceals
and
so
forth
which
is
as
the
taker
because
as
the
taker,
you
see,
can
be
punished
now
differently
depending
upon
whether
he
takes
more
money
or
less.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
can't
answer
that
for
sure
because
i've
not
made
a
detailed
analysis
for
that.
but
i
--
i
think
i'd
be
called
upon
to
make
--
to
answer
for
sure.but
one
of
the
problems,
you
see,
is
this.
there
are
very
few
federal
crimes
of
theft.
as
such,
you
don't
--
you
don't
find
the
taker
in
the
ordinary
statute
because
we
--
we
don't
have
a
constitutional
basis
to
grab
on
to
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
so
that
we
don't
--
we
--
we
just
--
chances
are
we
don't
get
this
type
of
relationship
so
that
i
--
i
can't
positively
say
without
studying
many
of
the
others.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
suspect
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
suspect
that's
correct.
although
they
would
have
--
there
are
other
codifications
which
have
taken
out
penalty
provisions
and
referred
them
to
other
section
which
i
--
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
that's
all
this
does.
it
refers
to
penalty
to
another
section.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
that
is
not
my
position.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
your
honor,
this
--
as
i
understand,
the
same
type
of
question
we
had
in
woody
and
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
i
think
it's
consistent
to
say.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
it
isn't
exactly
the
same.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
problem
of
offenses.
now,
i
may
explain
it
in
different
terms
and
it
has
been
explained
before,
but
i'm
trying
to
say
the
same
thing.what
we
have
here
are
different
offenses.
to
me,
to
my
mind
at
least,
it
requires
something
other
than
an
initial
impulse.
in
other
words,
i
would
say
to
you
if
receiving
means
the
same
as
when
he
scoops
up
the
money,
and
i
don't
believe
it
does,
but
if
it
means
that,
then
i
would
say
no,
you
cannot
convict
a
man
twice
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
who
robs
the
bank.
you
cannot
do
that.
under
this
statute,
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
think
you
do
either.
to
--
let
me
start
here.
although
these
are
not
dictionary
words,
to
my
mind,
they
--
to
start
with,
they
have
a
different
--
they
have
somewhat
of
a
different
meaning.
in
other
words,
when
a
man
receives
something,
at
least,
i
assume
there's
been
a
tender.
you
don't
have
that
with
a
taker.
a
taker
--
there's
no
tender
to
a
taker.
but
more
--
and
a
more
--
but
more
important,
i
think
the
word
“receiving”
in
this
statute
takes
on
meaning
from
the
rest
of
the
words
in
the
statute
as
well
as
the
whole
purpose
and
purport
of
the
section.
in
other
words,
what
we
had
in
the
previous
sections,
as
you
stated
in
prince,
i
believe,
was
the
gist
of
the
crime
is
to
steal.
all
of
the
words,
entering
or
robbing,
all
relate
to
this
--
to
this
intent
of
stealing.
but
these
words,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
do
not
relate
to
this.
these
words
are
a
group
of
words
intended
to
cover
all
possibilities,
not
necessary
that
they
all
apply
it
once,
but
all
possibilities
of
people
who
are
dealing
with
funds
which
had
been
taken
from
banks
and,
i
suggest,
which
the
government
obviously
in
the
case
of
insured
or
a
national
bank
has
certainly
a
perfect
right
to
deter.
in
other
words,
if
they're
taking
our
money
and
disposing
of
it,
certainly,
the
government
should
have
the
right
to
penalize
someone.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
now,
there's
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
think
it
did.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
let's
--
let's
just
before
careful.
let
see
what
he
was
charged
with.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
you
see,
he
is
charged
--
he
--
he
is
also
charged
with
disposing
and
concealing.
now,
if
--
if
we
get
to
the
facts,
counsel
has
said
that
they
are
not
--
that
--
that
they
--
they
don't
hurt
him,
i
think
they
do.
let
me
call
this
court's
attention
to
this.
he
--
he
doesn't
seem
to
think
there
--
as
much
to
the
fact
that
the
government
didn't
get
back
or
the
bank
didn't
get
back
its
money,
didn't
get
it
back.
i
suggest
that
this
is
really
evidence
of
disposition.
this
is
more
than
--
than
an
ordinary
type
of
thing.
this
isn't
a
question
of
a
man
who
just
robbed
a
bank.
this
is
a
man
who
has
done
something
entirely
separate.
he
is
disposed
of
the
money.
he
is
concealed
it
or
disposed
of
it.
now,
it's
true,
the
government
can't
prove
maybe
where
he
has
buried
it
or
can't
prove
where
he
has
got
rid
of
it
but
certainly,
we
can
prove
that
we
didn't
get
it
back.
now,
he
has
done
something
to
it.
we
think
this
is
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
or
sold
it.
let's
say
he
sold
it
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
or
--
or
handed
it
somebody
else
to
get
rid
of
it
because
he
was
afraid
that
there
was
--
that
the
serial
numbers
would
be
found
out
or
he
is
--
maybe
he
has
got
it
still
buried.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
but
in
any
event,
certainly,
this
came
as
a
separate
matter.
it
--
it
comes
as
a
separate
impulse.
it
could
--
there
could
be
more
than
one
crime
here
and
certainly,
the
government
having
insured
the
bank
or
if
it's
a
national
bank
has
a
right
to
deter
this
action.
now,
we
think
that
when
you
get
a
separate
impulse
or
separate
facts,
and
as
previously
mentioned
in
woody,
most
of
these
cases
have
separate
facts,
then
you
certainly
do
have
two
crimes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
let
me
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
think
the
problem
is
this,
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
someone
who
starts
on
a
course
of
crime
doesn't
really
consider
some
of
the
end
results.
and
i
think
that's
true.
in
other
words
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
very
true.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
but
there
is
also
this,
your
honor,
that
i
think
--
and
i
think
it's
probable
and
possible
that
after
committing
that
act
--
and
i
--
i
will
say
this.
he
is
--
he
is
going
to
rob
a
bank
and
there
is
no
question
that
he
is
going
to
get
some
profit
out
of
it.
he
is
either
going
to
sell
it
or
something.
after
he
robs
the
bank,
then
the
next
question
is
what
does
he
do?
i
am
not
so
sure
in
the
typical
case
he
has
thought
the
whole
thing
through.
and
if
this
is
possible,
then
we
may
be
able
to
show
separate
acts
of
concealing
which
are
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
could
very
well
be
thought
of
afterward
separate
acts,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
which
do
not
relate
even
to
the
same
sum
of
money
because
he
is
obviously
now
relegated
to
do
it,
for
instance,
in
this
case.
well,
i
--
it's
hard
to
tell
whether
it's
a
four
but
they
split
it
up
some
way,
so
he
isn't
dealing
even
with
the
same
amount
when
he
is
concealing
as
when
he
was
stealing.
he
may
do
even
further.
he
may
conceal
part
of
it
and
he
may
spend
part
of
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
facts
of
this
case
were
these,
that
the
--
that
the
concealment
came
into
effect
after
the
bank
robbery
had
been
committed.
what
are
facts
of
concealment?
number
one,
i
think,
is
the
fact
that
a
number
--
two
witnesses
here
testified
that
over
a
year
and
three
or
four
months
later,
none
of
this
money
has
come
into
--
has
come
back.
number
two,
i
think
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
that
he
--
they
went
to
this
house
that
night
and
they
spent
considerable
time
dividing
the
money
and
the
next
day,
the
next
day,
they
packed
it
away
separately
into
these
bags
and
in
the
cars
and
took
off.
the
evidence
produced
in
this
particular
case
shows
that
on
the
following
the
day,
they
arrived
at
a
place
where
they
picked
his
wife
and
there
is
some
more
talk
now
about.
and
one
of
the
accomplices
is
with
them
about
where
the
money
was
at
that
time
because
the
landlady
who
helps
put
him
some
luggage
doesn't
see
the
money
in
the
car.
he
--
it
has
been
concealed
as
more
evidence
of
purposeful
now
not
just
part
of
scooping
up
but
purposeful
concealment.
now,
certainly,
it's
been
disposed
of.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
know
they
didn't
because
the
facts
are
that
petitioner
did
not
take
any
of
the
money
from
the
bank,
he
did
not
conceal
anything
because
he
walked
out
of
the
bank
without
any
money.
the
--
of
--
some
of
the
others
took
the
money.
they
took
it
in
two
stolen
cars
as
getaway
cars
in
separate
directions.
they
got
the
money
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
purpose
of
concealing.
but
we
can't
charge
him
with
that.
they
also
get
into
this
house
and
they
don't
bring
all
the
money
in
at
the
same
time.
and
he
doesn't
have
it
even
then.
they
talk
about
splitting
the
money
as
to
what
division
should
be
made,
so
i
assume
that
the
jury
has
a
right
to
suppose
they
weren't
even
sure
how
they
were
going
to
divide
it
yet.
so
that
even
at
this
point,
petitioner
doesn't
know
how
much
money
he
is
going
to
profitably
get
rid
of.
it
is
split
and
part
of
it
is
not
split
evenly
because
there
is
some
talk
about
whether
others
have
debts.
and
i
only
mention
this
because
i
think
that
is
an
indication
of
a
possibility
of
disposing
of
something
prior
to
the
time
even
he
even
have
it
so
that
there
wasn't
possible
talk
of
a
crime
then.
in
other
words,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
there
are
number
of
acts,
i
think,
that
anyone
and
at
anytime
could
have
been
suffered.
and
i
am
saying
further
that
from
this
whole
set
of
facts
which
goes
on
for
a
period
of
time
after
the
bank
robbery.
and
certainly,
none
of
this
is
admissible
if
all
we
have
is
a
bank
robbery
because
anything
happens
after
it
becomes
irrelevant
really,
if
all
we
are
going
to
do
is
charge
a
man
with
bank
robbery.
all
this
becomes
--
all
of
this
evidence
becomes
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so
that
--
what
--
what
all
this
evidence
adds
up
to
is
this,
that
a
year
and
four
months
later,
the
government
still
hasn't
found
the
money,
so
it
has
been
concealed
part
of
it.
and
i
emphasize
not
the
money
that
has
been
robbed
but
the
part
of
the
petitioner
has
as
not
been
returned
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
not
--
not
necessarily.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
if
--
if
there
is
some
evidence
of
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
there
is
some
evidence
of
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
there
is
some
evidence.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
it
isn't
solely
a
matter
of
time,
your
honor.
at
least,
i
don't
relate
this
problem
solely
to
a
matter
of
time.
i
think
time
is
a
factor
but
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
what
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
it's
separate
acts,
entirely,
separate
acts.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
acts
of
putting
it
into
a
bank
and
concealing
it
in
a
different
form
than
it
was
because
--
let
me
--
let
me
pose
this.
i
think
that
in
an
ordinary
case,
if
you
see
a
brown
paper
bag,
a
brown
paper
bag
in
a
backseat
of
a
car,
this
--
an
ordinary
shopping
grocery
bag,
this
is
not
a
suspicious
article.
this
is
not
a
suspicious
article.
i
think,
in
other
words,
that
that
is
not
just
an
innocuous
or
a
happenstance
that
they
did
that.
i
think
this
is
a
purposeful
concealment
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
just
as
painting
of
the
car
in
the
stolen
car
case
is
a
purposeful
concealment
while
not
the
mere
driving
of
the
car
across
the
line.
driving
may
not
be
the
concealment,
although
it
has
--
has
been
suggested
it
could
be.
and
that's
not
a
separate
one.
so
that
--
but,
in
any
event,
i
think
that's
--
that's
what
the
acts
are.
but
furthermore,
in
this
case,
and
i
--
i
should
say
this
to
the
court,
the
reason
we
didn't
put
a
lot
of
facts
into
our
brief
is
not
because
we
don't
believe
they
substantiate
our
position,
we
do
believe
they
do,
we
think
what
--
we
didn't
want
to
be
inconsistent
with
woody
and
just
not
bring
this
case
here
because
that
would
be
suspicious.
but
we
think
that
petitioner
and
rightfully
so,
petitioner's
counsel
has
posed
the
question
here
unrelated,
unrelated
to
the
factual
context.
in
other
words,
after
--
you
couldn't
tell
this
from
the
petitioner's
petition
as
he
wrote
it
to
united
states
but
in
counsel's
word
and
as
the
brief
is
prepared,
we
feel
that
he
has
presented
a
question
which
is
unrelated
to
the
facts.
in
other
words,
he
is
saying
no
robber
regardless
of
the
factual
situation,
no
robber
can
ever
be
charged
and
indicted
for
the
crime
of
concealing
and
disposing.
and
in
that
context
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that
was
a
subsequent
argument.
i
think
the
argument
in
the
brief
is
directed
to
this.
now,
the
question
of
choice
of
--
and
--
and
this
--
and
i
will
say
this,
this
question
of
choice
came
up,
i
think,
in
the
relation
to
some
other
suggestions
in
prince
because
that
was
the
type
of
situation
suggested
by
prince.
and
if
that
is
so,
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
go
to
this
case
and
point
out
what
we
feel
are
some
of
the
distinguishing
factors.
why
this
is
not
prince?
perhaps,
that
would
in
turn
show
why
the
--
the
question
of
multiple
choice
on
the
government's
part
is
not
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
can
make
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
it
simple,
i
believe.
i
can
say
this.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
am
afraid
i
can't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
if
that's
what
i
said,
although
the
reasoning
is
the
same.
i
--
i
said
that
the
subsection
(c)
in
the
bank
robbery
statute
came
from
the
two
that
you
have
recited.
i
made
a
further
statement
though
that
i
think
is
essential
here,
and
that
is
that
the
national
stolen
property
act
came
from
the
dyer
act.
now,
i
say
that
because
a
great
bulk
of
cases,
down
to
1940,
that
arrived
at
the
court
of
appeals
are
under
the
dyer
act
and
are
not
under
the
national
stolen
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
property
act.
now,
i
have
documented
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
is
only
--
there
is
only
one
decision,
which
i
attend
gently,
uses
this
section
and
it's
not
in
point.
for
your
benefit,
it
is
ben
laska
versus
united
states.
i
say
i
attend
generally
because
laska
was
convicted
of
conspiracy
and
really
was
convicted
prior
to
the
--
unconnected
with
the
ransom
section.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i'm
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
believe
so.
i
believe
it's
the
same
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
all
the
--
i
think
all
the
problems
are
the
same.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
--
if
they
are
all
the
same,
your
honor,
then
i
suggest
i
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
down
to
1940
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
dyer
cases.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
only
one
that
they
have
found.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they
are.
now,
i'll
--
i
can
explain
perhaps
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
except
the
woody
brief
goes
beyond
1940.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
you
mean
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
that
is
not
--
oh,
i
take
it
back.
that
is
not
all
the
cases
down
to
1940.
this
is
--
these
are
cases
from
three
separate
circuits,
three
different
times.
i
mean
i
didn't
--
i
do
not
have
all.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
have
not
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
might
check
the
others
but
i
have
not.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
was
going
to
mention
briefly
a
fact.
this
is
not
prince
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one,
i
think
this
is
not
the
unique
type
of
statute
that
we
had
in
prince.
there
is
not
conflict
below
by
the
way.
there
is
one
other
bank
robbery
case
of
a
consecutive
type
and
i
should
mention
this
because
they
also
do
not
get
the
money
again,
so
that
they
have
a
similar
factual
problem.
but
i
think
we
noticed
in
woody
that
is
the
typical
problem
where
there
are
other
facts.
this
also
is
not
prince
because
it
was
not
put
into
--
cover
any
loopholes
somebody
trying
to
rob
a
bank,
they
got
away
with
it.
it
has
no
connection
with
that.
so
--
so
it
was
put
in
at
a
separate
time
for
different
reasons
and
is
clearly
to
--
at
least
in
my
mind,
is
related
unlike
some
of
the
prince
section.
this
section
is
clearly
related
to
other
statutes.
i
mean
regardless
of
how
you
may
interpret
the
other
statute,
certainly
it
is
the
same
words
that
are
used
in
other
statutes,
and
i
would
assume
we
cannot
give
to
these
words
one
meaning
here
and
a
different
meaning
in
the
other
statutes.
now,
one
brief
word
on
a
problem
posed
but
not
argued
too
greatly
about
petitioner
in
regard
to
double
jeopardy.
i
do
not
believe
this
case
poses
this
question
either
under
the
constitution
as
an
offense
and
i
suggest
that
holiday
versus
johnson
clearly
rules
that
this
was
not
a
double
jeopardy
problem
as
well
as
that
case
holding
that
it
is
a
--
not
a
habeas
corpus
question
but
a
rule
35.
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
in
all
of
the
three
questions
which
we
have
submitted,
one,
jurisdiction,
two,
the
meaning
of
subsection
3
and
(c)
on
the
double
jeopardy.
in
each
instance,
we
can
go
to
the
statute
and
the
jurisdictional
statutes,
we
think,
like
we
are
reading
of
it
that
what
we
have
suggested
is
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
2255,
that
a
clear
reading
of
subsection
(c)
includes
the
robber
and
does
not
have
any
language
which
excludes
the
robber
and
that
so
far
as
double
jeopardy,
the
constitution
has
a
separate
offense.
the
legislative
history
here,
if
there
is
this
power,
has
clearly
said
at
least
that
this
is
a
separate
offense.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
--
he
is
subject
to
parole.
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
case
which
clearly,
by
a
unanimous
court,
held
that
and
solely
on
the
question
of
parole
because
i
am
sure
the
petitioner
is
not
in
that
position
yet,
but
solely
on
that
question
is
mcnally
versus
hill
in
the
293rd
united
states.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
not
only
that
this
is
consistently
refused
to
review
this
type
of
thing
upon
habeas
corpus
but
the
petitioner
in
mcnally
claimed
that
the
reason
he
had
a
right
to
bring
the
habeas
corpus
was
because
he
was
being
denied
a
right,
you
see,
on
a
parole.
he
said,
"well,
i
can
--
he
made
exactly
the
argument
that
your
honor
has
made.
he
said,
"well,
i
can't
get
my
parole
going."
and
the
court
unanimously
held
that
"you
cannot
be
released
from
custody,"
which
is
the
purpose
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
is
not
--
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
whether
someone
will
give
you
a
parole.
and
there
--
that's
the
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
might
except
that
united
states
versus
hayman,
i
feel,
said
that
2255
was
put
in,
in
order
to
--
to
take
the
place
of
a
habeas
corpus
in
a
different
forum.
but
the
purpose
of
2255
was
that
all
of
the
habeas
corpus
petitions
not
be
presented
out
of
alcatraz
but
be
presented
in
a
forum
where
the
prisoner
had
been
convicted.
so
that
what
we
had
in
2255
both
by
history
and
as
a
long
judicial
conference
history
as
well
as
anything
else
as
well
as
supreme
court
case
law
is
to
the
effect,
i
believe,
that
2255
is
merely
a
substitute
for
and
not
an
extension
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
different
forum.
2255
also
provides
for
habeas
corpus
in
its
last
section,
if
there
is
something
else
that
comes
up
that
can't
be
handled.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
shouldn't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
take
time
to
answer.
