mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
if
the
court
pleases.
we
are
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
matter
arising
under
the
federal
bank
robbery
act.
the
petition
seeks
review
of
a
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
in
turn
had
affirmed
a
decree
of
the
district
court,
northern
district
of
alabama
which
refused
to
vacate
or
reduce
or
correct
a
sentence
which
as
then
existed
was
in
three
counts
before
the
district
court.
there
is
a
little
history
to
this
case
prior
to
the
action
on
that
motion
to
the
district
court,
which
was
a
2255
motion
and,
which
i
mentioned
parenthetically,
was
not
opposed
on
any
procedural
or
jurisdictional
ground
by
the
u.s.
attorney
who
had
notice
and
appealed
and
argued
and
was
not
--
when
it
eventually
reached
the
fifth
circuit
challenged
on
any
jurisdictional
or
preliminary
or
premature
argument
and
was
read
by
the
u.s.
attorney
in
the
fifth
circuit.
prior
to
the
action
of
the
district
court
of
which
we
complain
here,
there
had
been,
in
1954,
a
trial
on
a
five-count
indictment
arising
out
of
a
single
bank
robbery
and
charging
three
individuals
on
five
counts
with
participation
in
a
bank
robbery
and
receipt
and
disposition
and
so
forth
of
the
stolen
funds.
an
appeal
was
taken
from
the
conviction
of
guilty
on
all
five
counts
by
the
counsel
who
were
--
who
was
appointed
by
the
district
court
to
serve
the
then
appellant
before
the
fifth
circuit.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
on
the
direct
appeal
from
the
conviction,
various
arguments
were
raised
by
the
appellant
including
the
argument
that
he
had
been
subjected
improperly
to
successive
sentencing
when
that
was
not
allowed
by
the
statute.
the
government
confessed
there
apparently
in
that
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
two
counts
were
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
then
to
be
incorrect
and
were
ordered
eliminated.
those
were
counts
which
charged
the
defendant
with
both
being
guilty
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
making
robbery
a
crime
and
the
provision
making
larceny
a
crime,
so
that
on
remand,
from
the
fifth
circuit
then,
the
district
court
was
ordered
to
eliminate
two
counts
and
we
were
left
with
three
counts.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
all
five.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
sir.
and
as
will
later
appear,
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
enacting
in
the
--
in
the
decree,
which
i
now
challenge,
in
part
rested
its
present
decision
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
repetition
of
the
argument
which
had
been
made
in
the
first
direct
appeal
to
it.
so
that
when
we
got
back
to
the
--
when
they
got
back
to
the
district
court,
i
have
not
yet
in
the
case,
the
sentence
was
reduced
from
20
years
and
two
days
to
10
--
to
14
years
and
one
day
which
results
from
the
three
counts
based
on
robbery,
aggravated
robbery,
that
is
robbery
in
which
an
assault
upon
an
individual
was
committed,
conspiracy
and
the
count,
which
i
now
challenge
here,
the
count
based
on
subsection
(c)
for
receiving
and
possessing
and
disposing
of
the
funds
which
were
taken
in
the
robbery.
on
that
count,
we
were
given
a
year
and
a
day,
basically,
therefore,
the
issue
we
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that's
the
only
one
that's
in
issue
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
issue,
yes,
sir.
basically,
therefore,
we
have
the
--
the
question
under
the
bank
robbery
act
can
the
crimes
of
robbery
and
the
crime
of
the
receipt
of
stolen
money
be
made
the
basis
of
separate
indictments
and
separate
sentences
--
separate
counts,
excuse
me.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
beg
your
pardon?
and
disposition,
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
would
say
though
in
regard
to
that
there's
very
little
evidence
in
this
matter
of
what
disposition
if
any
was
made.
and
i
am
--
although
i
am
getting
little
ahead
of
it,
i
--
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
can
do
one
of
two
things,
it
can
decide
and
dispose
of
the
question
of
the
validity
of
count
4,
the
one
that
i
am
now
challenging
because
the
indictment
itself
in
the
record,
the
--
the
true
record
that's
before
this
court
shows
that
they
were
considering
--
both
courts
below
were
considering
a
single
robbery,
a
single
transaction
or
single
impulse,
however
you
wish
to
put
it.
and
if,
as
i
was
surprised
to
find,
that
it
is
possible
to
bring
before
this
court
now,
as
the
government
is
doing,
a
transcript
of
the
evidence
taken
in
the
first
trial
at
this
late
hour,
i
would
technically
think
that's
wrong.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
it.
i
think
that
that
is
--
that
creates
a
situation
in
which
a
petitioner
likely
might
be
prejudiced,
but
i
don't
feel
that
we
are
here.
i
don't
think
the
facts
are
much
in
dispute.
i
am
prepared
either
to
stipulate
the
facts,
although
i
have
not
been
invited
to
do
so
and
only
learned
quite
recently
that
the
government
wished
to
file
here
a
transcript
of
the
evidence.
and
when
i
use
the
term
“transcript
of
the
evidence”
i
am
talking
about
the
testimony
that
was
taken
in
the
trial
as
distinguished
from
what
i
considered
to
be
the
--
the
true
record
that's
before
this
court.
there
is
a
printed
record
here.
that
transcript
of
evidence
will
show
that
our
position,
i
think,
is
unassailable.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
no,
sir,
it's
just
in
the
folios
of
the
court
reporter,
and
i
might
say
that
we
had
a
problem
about
that
because
when
i
got
into
the
case
and
decided
that
that
record
was
not
before
the
court,
i
sort
of
dismissed
it
from
my
mind.
but
later,
i
thought
that
i
ought
to
know
what
had
taken
place
in
the
trial,
and
i
said
about
trying
to
get
hold
of
the
transcript
of
the
evidence.
none
was
available.
apparently,
the
government
had
lost
it,
so
i
didn't
get
one.
the
only
one
that
we
could
find
was
the
one
that's
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
of
the
district
court.
and
the
court
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
withdraw
that
so
that
i
might
read
it.
and
then
the
government
--
the
attorney
general's
office
got
after
us
to
let
them
use
the
copy
that
we
had
withdrawn,
which
we
were
glad
to
do.
and
now,
they
want
to
file
that
with
the
court
over
my
objection,
but
i
am
really
not
objecting
because
i
don't
think
the
facts
are
here
us
at
all.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
it's
about
800
somewhat
pages.
it's
four
folios
of
--
that
does
include,
mr.
justice,
the
argument
and,
as
i
recall,
and
the
court's
charge.
the
court's
charge
unfortunately
for
my
client
was
more
or
less
just
a
reading
of
the
statute.
there
wasn't
much
discussion
of
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
you
can
convict
a
man
twice
for
robbing
a
bank
of
money
and
then
for
receiving
that
money
that
you
--
that
he
--
he
took
in
the
robbery.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
sir?
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
wouldn't
be
a
jury
question
but
i
think
it
would
have
been
helpful
to
the
defendant
if
the
jury
had
--
had
explained
to
him.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that
problem,
yes.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
the
facts
were
in
dispute
because
my
man
denies
and
still
denies
guilt.
and
there
was
a
total
issue.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
he
was
convicted
of
both,
as
we
now
stand
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
now
stand
on
--
through
--
with
three
counts.we
are
convicted
of
aggravated
robbery,
that's
section
(d),
as
i
recall,
of
the
act
where
a
man
commits
a
robbery
and
an
assault
takes
place
in
the
course
of
it.
we
are
convicted
of
the
receipt
disposition
and
so
forth
of
the
stolen
money
on
a
second
count
and
then
a
third
count
under
the
conspiracy
statute.
i
am
not
in
position
to
raise
the
question
of
the
conspiracy
because
that
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
i
did
not
file
and
--
and
so,
i
--
as
i
indicated
before,
we
--
we
have
a
limited
problem.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
he
--
he
was
given
10
years
under
the
aggravated
assault
and
three
years
on
the
conspiracy
and
a
year
and
a
day
on
the
count
which
i
am
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
--
one
reason
that
impels
me
as
--
as
litigant
to
be
willing
to
admit
the
facts
or
stipulate
that
other
record
is
that
my
man,
if
he
is
to
get
some
relief,
can
only
get
a
year
and
a
day
reduced
from
his
sentence.
and
i
don't
want
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
litigate
anything
with
respect
to
what
the
facts
are
or
to
the
circuit
court
because
we
are
getting
near
the
point
at
which
we'll
be
eligible
for
parole,
as
i
understand.
and
if
we
don't
get
the
benefit
of
the
decree
now
determining
that
count
4
is
invalid
and
we
will
win
rather
empty
victory,
assuming
that
we'll
win
at
all.
and
for
that
reason,
we
--
we
think
that
you
--
you
are
in
position
to
do
just
what
you
did
in
prince.
you
are
in
a
position
to
say
here
that
you've
got
a
--
a
typical
bank
robbery
that
has
then,
for
purposes
of
congress,
dealt
with
in
stages
but
for
purposes
of
punishment,
does
not
warrant
imposition
of
--
of
successive
sentences
where
all
the
man
does
is
rob
the
bank
and
take
the
money
at
the
time
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
so
to
speak.
now,
we
think
that
our
argument
is
supported
a
little
bit
better
in
this
instance
by
the
history
of
the
act
and
by
what
the
act
itself
says.
the
government
belittles
the
fact
that
the
1948
codification
eliminated
from
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
deals
with
receipt
and
disposition
and
so
forth,
a
provision
for
$5000
fine
and
so
forth
and
instead,
merely
says
in
effect
that
a
man
who
receives
the
stolen
money
should
be
punished
in
the
same
manner
as
the
taker.
in
common
ordinary
english,
that
dealing
with
one,
the
receiver
and
two,
the
taker.
it
--
you
can't
mean
anything
else.
the
government
has
found
some
difficulty
itself
in
deciding
what
this
act
provides
with
respect
to
successive
sentencing
because
they
went
into
the
fifth
circuit,
as
i
understand,
in
the
heflin
--
in
the
case,
the
heflin
case
on
the
first
appeal
and
confessed
error,
said,
“you're
right,
you
can't
convict
a
man
for
robbery
and
larceny
at
the
same
time.”
and
then
according
to
one
of
the
footnotes
as
i
recall
in
the
position
of
this
court
in
the
prince
case,
they
said
we
were
wrong
in
doing
that,
we
still
think
now
that
you
can
sentence
him
for
everything,
for
entering,
for
robbery,
for
larceny
and
aggravated
larceny
--
robbery
and
so
forth.
so
that
the
government
finds
itself
unable,
at
all
times,
to
be
sure
just
what
this
act
provides.
and
i
think
probably
a
little
more,
definitely
than
--
it
occurs
in
most
of
the
legislative
history
that
was
considered
in
prince.
our
legislative
history
shows
what
congress
had
in
mind.
the
senate
report,
for
instance,
and
we've
set
it
out
on
page
9,
we
refer
to
it,
of
our
brief,
it
says,
captions,
“senate
report
number
1801”
which
was
the
report
from
the
senate
leading
to
the
1940
amendment
which
added
the
crime
that
we
are
concerned
with
in
the
receiving
count.
that
senate
report
was
captioned
“punishment
for
receivers
of
loot
from
bank
robbers.”
and
i
think
a
common
sense
reading
of
that
obviously
means
that
they
were
dealing
with
the
receiver
distinctly
from
the
man
who
is
the
robber
and
that
basically
is
our
case.
now,
certainly,
in
view
of
the
doubts
which
the
government
has
had
in
view
of
the
--
at
best,
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
the
doctrine
of
lenity
has
some
--
has
some
real
application
here.
the
court
has
been
considering
that
problem
and
has
heard
argument
about
it
for
two
days,
and
i'm
not
going
to
go
back
over
those
cases.
however,
i
--
i
think
that
if
ever
there
was
a
--
a
perfect
case
for
the
application
of
that
doctrine
of
construction,
this
is
it,
which
leads
me
finally
in
--
to
consideration
of
the
prince
case
itself.
we've
said
frankly
to
the
court
in
our
brief,
we
think
the
prince
case
decides
this.
we
think
it
does.
we
think
that
as
near
as
possible,
the
prince
case
has
said,
“you've
got
a
statute
here
that
deals
with
bank
robbery.”
it
--
it
deals
with
all
phases
of
bank
robbery.
however,
although
congress
has
seen
fit
to
deal
with
a
bank
robbery
as
a
crime
which
can
have
various
phases
before,
during
and
after,
those
phases
are
not,
when
committed
by
one
who
completes
a
bank
robbery,
each
entitled
to
be
made
the
basis
of
a
separate
count
and
a
separate
sentence.
in
prince,
of
course,
the
man
committed
the
first
phase.
he
entered
the
bank
and
then
the
robbery
occurred,
and
he
was
found
--
and
this
decision
--
the
court
--
the
decision
of
this
court
in
prince
holds
that
he
couldn't
be
sentenced
twice
for
that.
well,
what
we
are
looking
at
here
is
what
happened
after
he
robbed
the
bank
and
he
left
and
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
so
to
speak.
if
there
is
any
distinction
between
prince
and
my
case,
it's
chronological
and
nothing
else
because
in
--
in
the
amendment
that
we
are
dealing
with,
the
1940
amendment,
congress
reached
out
to
be
sure
that
it
brought
within
the
net
people
who
deal
with
bank
loot
after
the
robbery
has
been
completed.
in
the
1937
amendment,
as
i
recall,
that
was
before
the
court,
prince,
congress
was
dealing
with
--
with
people
who
were
intended
felons
but
for
some
reason,
did
not
complete
their
bank
robbery.
and
i
submit
that
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
man
in
prince,
for
instance,
might
enter
a
bank
and
remain
there
several
hours
and
decide
not
to
complete
the
robbery
or
the
--
his
confederates
fail
to
appear
or
the
--
the
strategy
doesn't
work
out,
and
he'd
be
guilty
if
proven
to
have
had
this
plan
underway.
and
he
may
spend
--
he
may
very
well
spend
considerably
more
time
than
was
spent
after
the
bank
robbery
by
my
--
by
this
petitioner
who,
as
the
record
will
show
if
the
court
does
look
at
this
transcript,
immediately
after
the
robbery
which
occurred
in
the
west
end
branch
of
the
first
national
bank
of
birmingham
in
west
end,
they
drove
using
two
cars,
drove
several
blocks
to
their
apartment
and
they
proceeded
immediately
within
a
matter
of
an
hour
or
two
to
divide
up
the
loot
according
to
the
testimony.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes
sir.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
think
it
might
be.
i
am
prepared
to
go
that
far
for
this
reason,
nothing
is
being
sacrificed
by
that.
if
this
--
if
it's
the
same
bank
and
the
same
plan,
the
same
intended
robbery,
nothing
is
being
sacrificed
from
a
public
policy
point
of
view
because
they
are
going
to
convict
this
fellow
as
being
a
bank
robber
and
they
can
give
him
the
maximum
as
a
bank
robber
anyway,
and
you
won't
have
the
problem
that
--
that
might
trouble
us
of
someone
of
--
state
in
punishment.
if
--
when
they
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
complete
the
robbery
the
second
time,
he
is
--
he
is
liable
to
25
years
and
he
will
probably
get
it,
if
--
and
he
will
get
it
if
he
is
guilty
so
that
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
mr.
justice,
when
i
started
worrying
about
this
case,
that
was
one
of
the
problems
that
worried
me
and
i
was
grateful
after
i
read
the
transcript
to
find
that
i
didn't
have
that
problem
in
my
case.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
however,
my
personal
opinion
is
that
--
that
if
he
is
dealing
with
the
same
loot
that
he
robbed,
it's
this
--
i
give
the
same
answer
i
gave
a
while
ago,
he
can
--
they
can't
--
they
can't
prove
that
he
is
disposing
of
loot
unless
they
prove
that
it
is
loot
which
he
stole
and
therefore,
at
any
--
i
mean
and
--
and
get
a
conviction
so
that
there
is
no
public
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
if
they've
proven
it
--
proven
it
was
stolen
by
somebody
else,
we
don't
have
the
problem
because
there,
he
--
that's
--
that's
entirely
different
set
of
facts.
i
am
assuming
you
are
addressing
your
question
to
the
situation
where
the
man
robs
a
bank
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
takes
the
same
loot
and
does
something
with
it.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
in
--
in
that
event,
i
say
the
maximum
punishment
he
gets
is
as
a
robber.as
long
as
the
criminality
that
they
are
trying
to
impose
upon
him
relates
to
the
money
that
he
stole.
i
think
congress
has
given
him
a
maximum
sentence
--
subjected
him
to
a
maximum
sentence.
i
think
the
government
has
got
to
elect
that.
that's
what
they
want
to
try
him
for.
that's
all
they
could
try.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
do,
yes,
sir,
because
the
facts
are,
as
i
put
them
to
you,
roughly,
and
they
--
the
--
i
didn't
mention
that
in
my
brief.
i
--
at
the
time
i
wrote
the
brief,
i
didn't
understand
this
practice
of
presenting
to
this
court
in
2255,
in
fact,
i
didn't
understand
2255
of
the
fact
but
[laughter]
matters
that
had
not
been
considered
by
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
sir?
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
i
[laughter]
--
i'm
in
the
less
select
portion
of
the
company
because
i
hadn't
heard
of
it.
i
mean
there
may
be
others
who
heard
of
it
and
didn't
understand
it.[laughter]
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
should
have
heard
of
it,
however,
we
feel
that
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
we
--
we
still
in
alabama
just
have
--
the
old
fashion
habeas
corpus
in
that
--
before
we
are
very
familiar
with
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i'm
not.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
it
does
not.
and
i
--
i
meant
to
take
that
position
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
question.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
the
government
has
--
has
not
made
much
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
after
i
read
the
brief
and
heard
the
argument
that
my
colleague
has
made
preceding
me,
i
can
understand
why
they
wanted
to
argue
most
about
the
facts
in
the
woody
case.
they
--
the
government
gets
considerable
comfort
as
they
frankly
admit
it
from
the
facts
in
the
woody
case
but
they
don't
get
much
comfort
and
they
relegate
the
facts
to
a
footnote
number
7
on
page
22
of
their
brief
in
my
case.
there,
they
make
this
argument.
they
say
that
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
did
not
even
carry
the
money
from
the
bank.
i
don't
know
what
the
relevance
of
that
is
because
he
was
convicted
of
it.
he
was
the
head
of
[laughter]
group
of
men
that
were
carrying
it
for
him.
the
loot
consisted
of
currency
and
redeemed
t-bonds.
it
was
counted
later.
now,
that
was
within
--
that
was
right
afterwards
not
just
later.
they
got
in
their
car
and
drove
over
to
the
apartment
and
divided
up
the
loot.
i
think
i
now
too
may
have
a
lapse
because
they
left
part
of
it
in
one
escape
automobile
and
had
to
go
back
and
get
that.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that
is
the
testimony
that
the
jury
heard,
yes.of
course,
the
petitioner
--
i
--
it
isn't
relevant
and
we're
not
litigating
it
but
the
--
the
petitioner
denied
all
participation
in
--
in
this.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
there
was
testimony
by
the
--
i
think,
by
one
of
the
bank
officers
that
it
had
never
been
recovered,
and
they
mentioned
that
in
--
in
this
footnote.
but
the
interesting
thing
that
i
wanted
to
call
the
court's
attention
to,
and
i
am
not
being
facetious
is
that
they
--
they
found
it
necessary
to
point
out
that
they
concealed
it
in
brown
paper
bags.
well,
actually,
it
was
a
lot
of
money
according
to
the
testimony,
and
they
had
to
pick
it
up.
so
they
picked
it
up,
put
it
in
paper
bags
out
of
a
gripper
or
briefcase,
something
they
were
carrying
which
is
a
same
act
as
putting
it
in
--
in
the
robber's
pocket
obviously.
now,
that's
a
long
way
from
committing,
it
seems
to
me,
subsequent
acts
of
concealment
involving
independent
impulses
or
involving
independently
begun
transactions
subsequent
to
the
main
robbery.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
it
does
not.
no,
sir.
i
--
i
thought,
however,
that
i
might
point
out
--
it
--
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
indicate
that
the
government
had
not
borne
down
very
hard
on
the
facts
in
this
case
at
all
because
they
--
they
get
very
little
--
little
aid
from
them.
now,
as
i
say,
i
was
surprised
to
learn
of
this
procedure
or
i've
learned
from
reading
the
briefs
and
looking
at
the
proceedings
in
the
gore
case
that
the
government
or
the
parties
do
make
available
to
this
court
the
trial
transcript
at
the
time
and
--
and
i
am
agreeable
to
that
here
because
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
already
indicated.
i
think
that
the
evidence
will
at
least
sustain
me
in
part
in
the
argument
that
i
have
made
briefly
to
the
effect
that
this
is
the
--
this
--
most
appealing
type
of
situation
in
which
a
doctrine
of
lenity
will
be
applied
in
construing
what
is,
at
best,
an
ambiguous
statute.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
haven't
found
it
necessary
actually
to
go
--
to
make
that
concession
that
there
may
be
some
discontinuity.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
have
--
i
have
adopted
the
conception
of
this
crime
as
being
--
as
i
tried
to
explain
before.
if
the
criminality
--
if
--
if
the
culpable
act
of
the
defendant,
who
is
charged,
relates
to
the
money
that
he
stole,
they're
going
to
have
to
prove
in
that
proceeding
that
he
stole
the
money
and
therefore,
i
say
the
maximum
and
only
punishment
for
him
is
as
a
stealer
of
money,
a
taker.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
--
i
would
reply
to
that.
i
would
reply
to
that.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
as
long
it's
the
same
loot
because
he
is
still
the
bank
robber
and
he's
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
i
do.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
i
--
i
meant
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
meant
to
suggest,
of
course,
i
was
saying
the
matter
that
--
that's
why
i'm
willing
to
--
in
oppose,
no
objections
to
considering
the
--
the
evidence
and
so
forth.
but
what
i
meant
to
conclude
with
was
the
fact
that
reading
this
record,
it
makes
such
an
appealing
case
for
the
doctrine
which
this
court
has
--
has
evolved
in
bell
and
the
universal
c.i.t.
case
and
--
and
has
repeated
in
the
ladner
case
recently
that
here,
the
--
the
disadvantage
is,
in
this
type
of
proceeding,
are
all
against
the
--
the
accused
and
largely
with
the
government.
it's
--
it's
an
eye
opener
to
read
a
record
like
this
and
realize
that
this
man,
and
here
again,
his
guilt
is
not
before,
but
he
was
convicted
largely
over
his
denial,
largely
on
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice
who
was
indicted
with
him
and
turns
state
evidence.
it
was
--
the
court
of
appeals
found
some
corroborative
evidence
in
the
--
at
best,
i
would
call
sort
of
tremulous
uncertainty
of
the
ladies
in
the
bank
whose
testimony
was
--
was
hardly
positive.
they
--
the
--
the
jury
convicted
this
man
largely
on
the
testimony
of
that
accomplice
who
was
brought
there
by
the
government
from
some
federal
institution,
as
i
recall,
in
indiana
or
somewhere,
and
whose
wife
was
under
sentence
at
the
same
time,
whereas,
the
defendant,
represented
by
the
court-appointed
counsel,
was
unable
to
obtain
the
testimony
of
the
other
--
the
other
co-conspirator
who
was
at
the
time
waiting
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
a
florida
institution
and
who,
according
to
a
showing
which
the
court
permitted,
was
prepared
to
say,
as
he
faced
this
maker
that
--
that
this
man,
heflin,
was
not
a
participant
in
the
robbery.
and
the
only
way
that
information
got
to
the
jury
was
through
a
showing.
it
would
permit
it
--
the
counsel
was
permitted
to
read,
which
is
considerably
less
effective
as
we
all
know.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
it
was
what
we
call
a
showing,
mr.
justice.
in
other
words,
counsel
for
the
accused
was
permitted
to
read
a
statement
and
say
to
the
jury,
“if
i
could
get
this
man
here,
he
would
testify
to
this
effect.”
and,
of
course,
the
government,
by
agreeing
to
that
showing,
does
not
wave
its
right
to
impeach
it
or
attack
it
and
does
not
actually
do
anything
more
than
agree
that
that's
what
the
man
would
say.
however,
after
that
showing
was
in,
and
i'm
getting
pretty
far-field
but
i
think
it's
very
interesting.
after
that
showing
was
in,
the
government
was
permitted
to
put
the
wife
on
of
the
man,
whose
statement
had
been
read,
to
testify
over
objection
of
the
accused
that
that
was
not
a
correct
statement
of
his
views
and
that
he
had
previously
stated
something
to
the
contrary.
that
was
obvious
hearsay
and
inadmissible,
incompetent.
and
counsel
did
at
best
to
keep
it
out
and
later,
the
judge
charged
the
jury
--
reconsidered
and
don't
consider
that.
that
--
that
was
incompetent
ever,
saying
we
should
not
have
heard
it
but
juries
are
--
juries,
they
--
that
--
that
was
a
--
a
sort
of
thing
that,
i
think,
happens
in
the
course
of
trials
frequently
and
the
judge
was
doing
the
best
he
could
ruling
hurriedly.
but
i
say
that
this
fellow
has
been
put
to
enough
burden
without
having
a
strict
construction
of
the
statute
imposed
on
him.
i
don't
think
congress
meant
for
him
to
be
subject
to
consecutive
sentences
for
what
the
indictment
shows
and
what
the
evidence
will
show.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
i
--
i
think
that
because
we
are
having
so
much
trouble
in
this
field,
i
didn't
realize
until
i
started
reading
all
these
cases
that
perhaps
a
pronouncement,
a
little
more
general
than
the
facts
of
my
case
require
for,
would
be
helpful
to
the
bar.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
i
appreciate
that
very
much,
chief
--
chief
justice
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
but
i
--
i
don't
think
my
time
is
important
enough
to
ask
the
court
to
(inaudible)
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
and
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
if
it
is
convenient
and
if
it
will
not
inconvenient
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
the
court,
i
will
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
undertake
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
briefly
to
reply
but
i
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
i
hesitate
to
do
it.
it
will
not
inconvenience
me
greatly
to
return
in
the
morning,
and
i'll
be
happy
to
take
a
few
minutes
in
the
morning,
if
i
may
do
so,
to
reply
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
(inaudible)
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
thank
you,
sir.
if
the
court
pleases,
at
the
close
of
the
day
yesterday,
i
think
the
court
was
giving
some
attention
to
the
argument
which
the
government
has
suggested
that
our
case
is
premature
under
section
2255
and
late,
under
rule
35
of
the
criminal
rules.
we
did
not
argue
this
in
our
brief.
we
were
not
at
--
in
the
preparation
of
that
brief,
aware
of
the
tenacity
of
the
government
on
this
point.
we
thought,
and
i
think
with
good
reason,
that
that
matter
was
sufficiently
at
rest.
we
drew
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
argument
was
made
at
length
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
was
granted
over
that
opposition.
we
realized
that
gore
against
the
united
states
had
proceeded
as
a
case
under
2255
and
had
been
entertained
although
custody
under
successive
sentences
there
was
precisely
involved.
and
finally,
we
relied
on
what
the
statute
itself
says
that
it
may
be
--
that
relief
under
it
may
be
sought
at
anytime.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
both
the
statute
and
the
rule
provides
substantially
the
same,
mr.
justice.
of
course
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
2255,
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
there's
one
court
of
appeals,
i
believe,
it's
the
district
court
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
--
in
the
holloway
case,
i
think,
which
doesn't
involve
the
problem
we
have
here
but
saw
fit
to
comment
that
under
rule
35
of
the
criminal
rules
and
under
2255,
the
party
concerned
was
entitled
to
seek
relief
at
any
time,
and
that
that's
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
those
words
anytime.
now,
i
think
we
have
trouble
with
rule
35
if
this
is
precisely
--
if
this
is
only
a
proceeding
in
the
original
criminal
case,
then
we
are
probably
caught
by
the
rule
22,
as
i
recall,
of
this
court.
however,
i
don't
think
that
rule
35
of
the
criminal
rules,
although
it
appears
in
that
section
of
--
of
the
rule,
should
be
dealt
with
as
only
a
--
a
provision
for
further
proceedings
in
the
original
criminal
case.
i
--
i
think
there's
a
good
reason
and
some
authority
to
say
that
that
rule,
just
like
2255,
invites
a
collateral
inquiry
into
a
criminal
judgment.
and
collateral
inquiry
into
a
criminal
judgment
traditionally
by
habeas
corpus
has
always
been
considered
in
the
nature
of
--
of
a
civil
proceeding,
not
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
so,
i
think
we're
--
we're
--
actually
we
are
here
in
a
something
like
a
civil
proceeding
and
therefore,
we
should
not
be
caught
by
rule
22
of
this
court,
if
that
is
the
government's
contention.
and
i
think
certainly,
that
we
are
not
premature
under
the
statute.
i
think
it's
the
most
harsh
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
this
statute
that
obviously
was
designed
to
create
benefits
and
to
make
it
easier
and
more
simple
for
people
under
sentence
to
obtain
relief
against
illegal
and
incorrect
and
invalid
sentences.
it's
the
most
harsh
thing
for
the
government
to
say
that
before
you
get
that
benefit,
you've
got
to
serve
part
of
the
illegal
sentence
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
relieve
against.
so
as
i
say,
we
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
don't
think
so.
i
could
be
in
error
about
that.
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
for
instance,
the
language
of
this
court
recently
in
ladner
indicates
certainly
that
this
type
of
thing
is
not
jurisdictional.
and
if
the
government
doesn't
see
--
see
fit
to
raise
it
below,
it's
--
the
government,
itself,
is
untimely
in
making
the
argument
that
our
case
is
premature
because
we
are
not
as
yet
serving
time
under
the
consecutive
sentence
that
we
ought
to
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
think
the
--
there
was
a
temporary
commitment.
the
trial
was
1954.
and
i
think
there
was
a
temporary
commitment
then
--
and
--
and
as
far
as
i
can
determine
from
the
record,
approximately
four
and
a
half
or
possibly
five
years,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
sir,
we
are
getting
close
to
the
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
will
say
that
i
have
the
impression
from
reading
the
record
that
neither
the
district
judge,
who
is
a
--
an
able
and
experienced
district
judge,
neither
he
nor
the
parties
nor
the
court
of
appeals
were
troubled
by
the
thing.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that's
correct.
of
course,
i
think
that
i
can
agree
with
you
that
the
government
ought
to
explore
these
problems
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
so
we'll
know,
at
least
so
that
other
parties
will
now.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
sir?
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
it
was
not
within
30
days,
as
i
recall,
so
that
we
would
be
caught
under
rule
22
if
we
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
it
was
within
the
several
time.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
the
petition
was
prepared,
as
i
understand,
by
the
individual,
himself,
in
prison.
and
he
was
proceeding
as
i
read
it
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
timely
and
i
think
he
was
correct
certainly
sufficiently
filed
first.
the
--
there
is
another
matter
suggested,
i
think,
yesterday
by
counsel
for
the
government
relative
to
this
statute
which
he
has
finally
found.
that
was
18
u.s.c.
101
at
35
stat.
which
he
--
he
suggests
then
some
support
to
his
contention
that
congress
can,
when
it
sees
fit,
use
very
definitive
language
about
who
is
a
receiver
and
who
is
not.
with
all
due
respect
to
my
colleague
here,
i
--
i
think
that
this
is
almost
a
reminder
of
the
devil
quoting
scripture.
they
finally
have
found
a
--
a
statute
which
was
obscure
up
--
in
this
case
up
until
just
now,
which
they
suggest
may
lend
some
help
to
them.
actually,
however,
i
--
i
heard
they
ran
that
statute
down.
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
know
that
--
that
the
1946
edition
of
the
code
was
amended
in
1948.
and
that
section,
which
was
101,
became
18
u.s.c.
641.
and
in
18
u.s.c.
641
in
1948,
the
draftsmen
dropped
out
this
little
phrase
about
which
has
theretofore
been
stolen
by
any
other
person.
and
they
did
something
else.
they
--
they
combined
in
1948,
they
combined
prior
sections
of
the
code
which
had
dealt
with
the
principal
robbers
or
thieves
who
dealt
with
government
property.
so
that
after
1948,
the
code,
in
one
section,
deals
with
the
receipt
of
stolen
property
and
also,
the
stealing
of
property.
and
it
only
uses
the
phrase
"receiver
of
stolen
property".
it
doesn't
say
a
receiver
of
stolen
property
stolen
by
another
person.
now,
no
one
paid
much
attention,
apparently,
to
the
dropping
out
of
that
phrase.
and
i'm
sure
that
prosecutions
have
--
have
continued
on
to
the
amended
section
just
as
they
did
under
the
old
section
101,
which
--
to
which
reference
was
made.
but
it
does
indicate
to
me
something,
i
think,
that
is
helpful
in
trying
to
find
out
if
we
can
what
congress
was
doing.
in
that
in
1948,
the
code
was
further
amended
to
provide
a
separate
section
which
is
under
the
heading
of
"arraignment,
pleas
and
trial"
that
reads,
“receiver
of
stolen
property
triable
before
or
after
principal”.
now,
that
is
now
18
u.s.c.
3435
and
it
reads,
“a
person
charged
with
receiving
or
concealing
stolen
property
may
be
tried
either
before
or
after
the
trial
of
the
principal
offender.”
now,
the
interesting
thing
about
that
is
that
there
was
a
provision
like
that
in
old
101
which
would
have
been
limited
to
the
receiver
that
dealt
with.
but
now,
we
have
a
general
statute
under
federal
criminal
procedure,
arraignment,
pleas
and
trial
that
indicates
that
at
least
procedurally,
congress
knows
how
to
deal
separately
with
the
receiver
and
with
the
principal
offender.
and
that
congress
all
along
has
meant
to
do
so,
i
think,
is
the
only
logical
deduction
you
can
make
from
the
history
of
that
little
statute
which
they
found
and
--
and
cited
to
the
court
yesterday.
one
other
matter
that
was
somewhat
newly
stressed
in
argument
is
the
reference
to
the
decisions
in
the
lower
federal
court
under
the
dyer
act
and
under
the
stolen
property
act
prior,
as
i
recall,
to
1940,
i
think,
was
the
date
the
government
was
considering.
i
didn't
--
i
was
unable
to
run
all
of
those
down
but
i
did
take
another
look
at
the
two
that
are
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
one
of
them
is
johnson
against
zerbst
in
the
tenth
circuit.
and
what
that
case
held
sometime
ago
was
that
an
individual
may
be
convicted
and
sentenced
under
two
counts,
one,
for
transporting
a
stolen
automobile
and
two,
for
receiving
and
concealing
that
same
automobile
as
part
of
a
single
transaction.
so
that,
actually,
if
i
understand
the
government's
position
now
that
is
authority
for
a
type
of
situation
to
which
they
would
not
even
apply
the
statute
in
its
present
form.
in
other
words,
that
court
said
that
although
you
have
a
--
a
transporting
of
a
car
and
the
receipt
of
a
car
simultaneously
in
one
transaction,
that
court,
the
tenth
circuit
thought
consecutive
sentences
could
be
imposed
under
that
--
under
the
dyer
act.
i
don't
think
that's
very
helpful
in
--
in
trying
to
ascribe
a
purpose
to
congress
to
read
an
undisclosed
knowledge
of
the
attorney
general
that
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
1940
amendment,
section
(c)
in
the
statue
now
with
which
we
are
concerned,
there
had
been
some
consideration
of
the
problem
by
lower
courts.
neither
do
i
think
we
are
aided
very
much
by
the
other
case
cited
in
the
government's
brief
which
is
a
sixth
circuit
case.
new
york
against
the
united
states
in
199
federal
because
there,
a
man
tried
somewhat,
it
seems
to
me,
as
the
petitioner
here
was
tired,
was
found
to
have
been
denied
the
type
of
complete
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
he
was
entitled
to
and
his
conviction
was
reversed,
a
conviction
based
primarily
on
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice
and
--
and
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
district
court
had
injected
himself
a
little
bit
too
much
into
the
trial
of
the
case
in
order
to
let
the
conviction
stand.
and
the
conviction
was
reversed.
and
then
by
way
of
advice,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
at
page
780
said,
"we
note
by
word
of
caution
our
disagreement
with
the
court
and
counsel
that
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
one
of
the
two
counts
is
inconsistent
with
a
similar
verdict
on
the
other."
in
other
words,
there
was
some
confusion
even
in
that
case
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
or
not
you
could
convict
a
man
for
both
--
and
sentence
a
man
for
both
transporting
and
receiving
an
automobile
that
had
been
stolen,
transporting
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that's
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
i
think
--
i
think
still
that
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
congress
was
doing
in
1940
is
what
it
--
what
the
senate
committee's
report
said
in
its
caption,
that
they
were
dealing
with
receivers
of
stolen
property
from
bank
robbers.
and
i
think
that's
considerably
more
persuasive.
then
the
long
jump,
the
long
double
jump
that
you
have
to
make,
one
that
congress
was
giving
any
attention
to
the
attorney
general's
thoughts
at
all
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
but
it's
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
the
most
definitive
part
of
this
particular
report
i
think.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
he
got
it
simultaneously
with
the
division
according
to
the
record,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
the
--
the
robbery
was
his
act.
they
were
all
confederates.
he
was
convicted
and
--
and
tried
as
a
bank
robber
because,
of
course,
he
was
part
of
the
bank
robbery.
and
i
--
i
think
he
as
much
--
if
--
if
the
verdict
stands,
he
is
as
much
a
robber
whether
he
actually
holds
the
hand
of
the
man
that's
carrying
the
loot
out
of
the
bank
or
whether
he
is
just
one
of
them
in
the
party
committing
the
robbery.
i
--
i
don't
see
any
distinction
there
at
all.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
i
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
but
i
maybe
wrong.
i
don't
remember
exactly
what
his
letter
said.
i
believe
his
letter
said
that
a
--
that
it
could
have
said,
"i'd
have
to
--
i
don't
trust
my
memory
that
a
bill
was
accompanied
it
when
he
sent
the
letter
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
--
i
believe
it
probably
did.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
the
caption
is
on
the
report,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
no,
sir.
that
--
that
caption
was
put
on
by
the
draftsman
of
the
report.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
yes,
sir.
well,
this
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
the
two
cases,
which
have
been
cited,
are
very
helpful.
and
i
don't
think
they
hold
or
establish
any
concert
in
the
courts
below
prior
to
1940
whatsoever.
i
think
that
we
are
left
with
the
situation
that
apparently,
if
the
government's
view
is
correct,
the
court
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
interested
parties
must
guess
when
the
bank
robbery
has
reached
a
sufficient
point
in
time
or
in
nature
that
it
becomes
a
second
transaction.
and
i
submit
that
if
you've
got
to
guess
about
that
sort
of
thing
as
to
when
a
second
transaction
occurs
or
when
a
second
impulse
arises
to
commit
a
criminal
act,
that
you've
got
the
most
typical
--
the
most
questionable
type
of
ambiguity
in
a
statute.
if
you
--
if
--
if,
as
they
now
admit,
that
the
actual
receipt
immediately
on
the
commission
of
the
bank
robbery
is
not
a
second
offense,
then
everytime
the
statue
is
applied,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
guess,
have
they
carried
the
bank
robbery
far
enough
away
from
the
bank
to
justify
the
imposition
of
a
second
sentence.
we
think
that
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
well,
it's
unlike
most
factual
issues,
i
think,
that
a
jury
should
have
to
determine
under
a
statute,
which
is
a
criminal
statute.
i
think
criminal
statues
are
required
to
have
a
sufficient
definiteness
so
that
it
--
it
we
can
understand
in
advance.
someone
can
understand
in
advance
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
--
reasonably
whether
the
crime
has
been
committed.
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
that
may
be,
but
you're
going
to
have
the
result
that
in
one
trial
of
a
--
of
a
bank
robbery,
punishment
may
result
from
two
sentences
whereas
in
almost
identical
circumstances
in
another
trial,
you'll
have
one
sentence
or
three
or
four.
and
i
think
the
--
you'd
--
you'd
be
almost
--
you'd
be
running
a
pretty
good
risk
that
the
uniformity
of
punishment
that
--
that
congress
must
have
intended,
we
think,
would
just
be
impossible
of
accomplishment.
and
i
think
you
run
one
other
risk
--
mr.
jerome
a.
cooper
i
don't
know,
sir,
i
assume
it
does.
but
the
problem
is
not
what
--
what
do
you
do
for
the
man
who
had
been
acquitted,
the
problem
is
--
we
have
two
problems,
what
do
you
do
with
the
man
who
is
charged
before
trial,
what
are
--
what
can
he
reasonably
expect
and
two,
what
do
you
do
with
the
man
who
has
been
found
guilty
under
two
counts
and
then
you
have
to
decide,
do
those
two
counts
actually
relate
to
sufficiently
separate
sets
of
facts
to
be
valid,
one
under
the
statute
and
two,
to
be
constitutional
as
not
imposing
--
not
violative
of
the
provision
against
double
jeopardy?
and
i
don't
--
i
am
serious
--
we
were
serious
in
our
brief
that
you
can
have
a
problem
of
double
jeopardy
if
a
mistake
is
made,
and
two
sentences
are
imposed
when,
in
fact,
there
should
only
have
been
one.
i
would
like
to
close
with
reminding
the
court,
if
i
may,
that,
at
least,
in
our
case,
there
isn't
much
question
about
what
the
set
of
facts
was.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
appeal
had
this
to
say
about
it.
this
is
in
the
first
appeal,
223
f.2d
374,
on
january
23rd,
the
robbery
was
executed
according
to
plan,
the
getaway
was
made
and
the
loot
divided,
all
at
one
time.
that's
the
situation
they
dealt
with.
and
then,
on
this
appeal,
on
our
motion
presently
before
the
court,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
repeated
again
what
it
had
decided
on
the
first
appeal,
its
opinion
that
receiving
stolen
money
and
conspiracy
are
offenses
separate
from
bank
robber.
and
the
only
proof
that
ties
this
petitioner
to
that
stolen
money
was,
as
we've
outlined
previously,
namely,
the
he
is
charged
with
being
in
the
bank
and
was
shortly
thereafter
receiving
his
share
of
the
loot.
there
isn't
a
word
of
evidence
in
this
record
after
that,
that
he
ever
had
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
money,
that
he
disposed
of
it,
sold
it
or
concealed
it.
and
i
think
it's
an
unwarranted
position
of
the
government
to
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
an
isolated
statement
in
the
record
that
the
money
had
not
been
recovered,
creates
