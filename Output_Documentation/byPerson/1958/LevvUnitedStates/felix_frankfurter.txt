justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
you
--
you
do
not
want
us
to
withhold
asking
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
want
us
to
withhold
asking
questions,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jencks
came
down
after
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
contention
that
the
fact
that
the
statement
was
signed,
was
it
was
signed
or
is
that
in
doubt,
was
the
statement
signed
by
carlin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
news
of
the
statement
would
disclose
who
is
right,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statement
itself
would
show
whether
it
was
or
wasn't
signed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
onto
that,
i
--
if
it
were
signed,
if
the
statement
is
signed,
in
your
view,
does
that
automatically
bring
it
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
whether
it
was
or
it
wasn't
signed
can
be
determined
by
inspection,
can
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
court
of
appeals
inspect
to
find
out
whether
it
was
signed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore,
you're
not
contesting
the
finding
by
the
court
that
it
wasn't
signed,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
then
say
--
i
want
to
go
step
by
step
because
it's
a
very
tricky
statue,
at
least
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
then
say
that
the
statement
might
be
adopted
or
approved.
which
one
do
you
rely
on,
they
were
both
adopted?
it
might
be
adopted
without
being
signed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
that,
what
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
that,
what
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
--
if
the
record
is
barren
of
a
scrutiny
of
that
issue,
nobody
can
tell.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
cross-examination
would
have
to
be
now
and
not
then.
i
mean,
it
couldn't
have
been
because
that
issue
wasn't
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
would
have
to
be
now.
it
couldn't
be
on
the
document
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
t
cannot
be
decided
on
the
record
as
it
was
produced
at
the
trial
because,
then,
this
problem
wasn't
in
existence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
exactly
wasn't
in
existent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
say,
as
to
one
of
the
jencks
statute,
that
it
is
open
to
you
to
establish
what
couldn't
have
been
established
at
the
trial
and
what
cannot
be
established
from
the
document
that,
in
fact,
it
was
approved,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
--
from
this
record,
it
couldn't
have
been
established
at
the
original
trial
because
that
was
in
nobody's
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
to
the
next
thing,
whether
it
was
a
stenographic,
mechanical,
electrical,
or
rubber
recording
within
the
substantially
verbatim
recital,
the
court
went
--
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
an
examination
of
the
document.
it
answered
that
intrinsically
from
the
document,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong,
assuming
that
procedure
is
to
be
followed,
can
be
still
establish
by
the
document
by
those
who
have
power
to
see
the
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
document
may
show
on
the
face
--
a
document
may
show
on
its
face
that
it
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.
the
document
may
show
that,
and
i'm
not
saying
this
does,
but
a
document
may
show
that
it
is
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital,
may
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
and
--
or
it
may
show
the
opposite,
or
it
may
be
in
doubtful
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wouldn't
it
be
up
to
the
defendant
to
lay
the
foundation,
at
least,
for
a
conclusion
that
there
was
more
than
one
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all,
nobody
is
in
a
better
position
than
he
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that,
to
me,
doesn't
prove
that
there
were
two
statements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
raising
a
doubt,
you're
raising
the
suggestion
of
the
plausibility
or,
perhaps,
possibility
that,
because
he
thought
he
had
signed
something
and
a
document
is
produced
which
isn't
signed,
that
there
must
be
in
existence
another
document
which
is
signed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
witness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
had
an
opportunity
to
counter
that
affidavit,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
an
opportunity
to
file
some,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
weren't
tr
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
won't
refuse
an
opportunity
to
file
a
counter-affidavit
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant's
memory
is
strong
or
substantial
that,
if
this
document
isn't
signed,
then
there's
must
be
in
existence
another
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
could
file
an
affidavit
saying
that
you
rest
on
the
affidavit
of
carlin
that
he
thought
he'd
signed
it
and
they
now
produce
something
that
wasn't
signed
and,
therefore,
probability
exists
that
there
must
be
another
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
evidently,
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
i
understand
your
argument.
i'm
suggesting
you
made
no
suggestion
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
you
filed
no
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
there
was
now
produced
a
document
which
was
not
signed
by
carlin.
carlin
had
testified
that
he
thought
he'd
signed
one.
therefore,
there's
probability
that
another
document
exists
and,
therefore,
you
want
a
chance
to
cross-examine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
put
all
that
in
the
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they're
repetitive,
because
the
--
i
hope
your
experience
in
life
is
better
that
mine.
a
number
of
times,
i
think
i
had
done
something,
when
it
turns
out,
i
didn't.
it's
very
possible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
even
carlin's
testimony
might
be
treacherous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
remains
to
be
treacherous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
--
they
probably
didn't
know
and,
incidentally,
they
didn't
know.
they
wouldn't
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
care.
at
that
stage,
that
wasn't
an
issue
because
there
were
no
such
statute
and
no
jencks
decision.
i'm
suggesting
you
were
then
confronted
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
an
affidavit
and
a
document
and
you
could
then
have
proffered
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
ask
them
the
opportunity
to
have
the
matter
searched
by
cross-examination
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
in
the
record,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably,
judges
read
records
before
they
decide
questions
of
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
--
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you've
just
said
that
there
had
been,
before
the
court
of
appeals,
an
ex
parte
submission
of
a
document
by
which
you
had
not
been
notified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
--
does
the
record
show
when
and
by
what
formality
this
statement
--
this
affidavit
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals?
have
we,
before
us,
anything
from
which
i
can
find
on
the
date
when
this
affidavit
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
compared
with
the
date
of
disclosure
to
you
through
the
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
makes
a
lot
of
difference.
i
asked
you
the
question.
i
asked
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
you
whether
i
am
to
infer
that
there
had
been,
before
the
court
of
appeals,
for
some
time,
an
ex
parte
document
of
which
you
had
notice
only
subsequently,
and
i
evidently
misheard.
i
thought
you
said
the
answer
to
that
was
yes.
i'm
bound
to
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
have
shocked
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
ex
parte
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
were
given
notice
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
true
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
true
of
every
pleading.
there
isn't
an
advance
notice
that
a
pleading
will
be
filed.
i
don't
call
that
ex
parte.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that,
to
me,
is
very
important
because
i
can
--
i
repeat,
i
would
have
been
in
deep
shock
if
the
government
permitted
something
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
before
that
court,
before
notice,
at
the
same
time
the
filing
was
given
to
the
opposite
side.
i
would
not
call
that
according
to
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
--
i
don't
see
what
more
you
could
have
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
any
light
as
to
the
member
of
three
jencks
cases
that
are
before
courts
of
appeals
that's
being
held
there
or
before
us
or
will
be
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
pre
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pre-jencks
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pre-jencks
decision
as
to
trial
court,
post-jencks
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
post-jenks
statute
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
i
infer
that
the
judgments
are
controlled
by
same
considerations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
the
only
question
as
to
lev
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
my
question
was
whether
petitioner
lev
made
any
other
error,
except
for
non-conduction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
us,
the
only
question
as
to
him
is
the
non-conduction
of
sending
it
to
your
colleagues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
--
before
you
embark
on
your
coherent
discussion,
if
you're
allowed
to,
do
you
take
care
of
a
suggestion
that
was
made
that
this
is
a
judge-handled
statute
that
the
government
can
be
compelled
that
they
--
the
defendant
can
be
compelled
to
produce
documents
if
the
government
can't?
i
can't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
don't
argue
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wondered
whether
--
what
there
was
to
that
act.
it's
all
mysterious
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
longhand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
longhand
dictation
is
no
different
from
a
short
hand
dictation.
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
in
interest
of
your
time,
we
could
all
read
the
opinion
and
see
what
you
agree
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
another
star
you
have
to
clear,
mr.
davis,
and
that
is
the
restriction
(e),
another
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
some
more
how
this
works.
indications
of
suppression
of
illegally
secured
evidence
are
necessary
to
have
such
a
motion
made
pretrial
so
that
the
trial
couldn't
be
interrupted.
apparently,
in
regard
to
impeaching
trial
report,
an
authenticated
document,
that
must
be
done
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
happen
to
it,
i
don't
know
then
but,
i
suppose,
one
policy
is
that
when
a
witness
testifies,
the
counsel,
on
cross,
lays
the
foundation
to
ask
him
for
a
report.
i
suppose
that
is
a
question
that
you
need
to
choose
to
make
discovery.
if
it's
dealt
with,
the
jury
would
sit
out
of
the
room
for
many
hours,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
not
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
or
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
might
--
suppose
you
might
well
require
a
witness
to
cross-examination
to
the
circumstances,
under
which,
the
document
is
filed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
gives
it
to
the
judge
to
look
at?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can't
--
but
i'm
talking
about
if
they're
discussing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
may
require
a
testimony,
whether
it
does
or
it
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it's
about
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
do
know
that,
in
a
few
rare
instances,
suggestions
for
voir
dire
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
had
been
made.
i
don't
know
if
any
such
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
he
can
avoid
doing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
whether
a
minute
is
somebody's
summary
of
a
long
conversation
or
whether
it's
a
verbatim
or
whether
it's
approved,
i
don't
see
that
the
document
necessarily
would
disclose
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
got
to
believe
that
we
have
seen
minutes
of
conversation
that
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
real
vital
conversation.
if
it
was
adjective
we
used,
they'd
put
nouns
just
before
the
qualification
or
after,
now,
as
to
all
that,
they
had
to
have
some
criminal
issue.
how
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
experience
tell
from
the
doctrine
whether
that's
the
way
the
fellow
called?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can
tell
if
he
so
appropriately
characterized
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
am
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
an-hour's
talk
with
him.
i
then
went
home
and,
the
next
day,
i
reported
it
by
telling
these
dial-ins
of
evidence
the
states
made.
no
story
--
i
would
really
think
that
those
are
accurate
accounts
of
what
was
raised
in
camera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
they've
raised
and
knowing
that
wouldn't
make
it
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
come
back
with
an
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
so
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
suggestion
that
i
should
be
concise.
if
the
courts
have
ruled,
we
can't
hear
testimony.
he
couldn't
possibly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
many
other
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
is
not
a
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
would
not
restrict
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
to
the
examination
of
the
document
if
his
examination
reasons,
as
a
matter
of
expression
and
understanding
to
say
“i
can't
tell
from
the
argument
if
we
could
do
this
and
i
want
to
ask
some
questions.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
there
be
a
sanction
of
perjury
if
nobody
could
get
it?
i
suppose
if
you
couldn't
get
it
to
defend
the
man
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
life
or
liberty,
you
couldn't
get
it
to
convict
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
relevant,
when
you
use
the
word
“relevant,”
something
is
relevant,
i
take
it,
you
mean
--
you
use
the
term
for
its
technical
connotation
as
used
in
the
law
of
evidence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
to
all
the
exclusionary
rules
of
the
law
of
evidence,
subject
also
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
allowing
range
of
cross-examination,
allowing
the
range
of
impeachment,
and
all
the
other
ranges
of
discretionary,
exclusionary
authority
or
admissibility
authority
to
the
filing
of
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
done
it
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
done
it
this
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
have
to
speculate
now
whether
it's
unusual?
my
own
guess
would
be
that
i
think
your
prophesy
will
not
be
fulfilled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
may
be
even
more
wrong
than
you
may
be
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
--
so
long
as
you
concede
or
recognize,
as
i
think
one
must,
that
under
this
statute,
it
may
become
necessary,
and
it
is
open
to
the
court,
indeed
you
may
be
asked
to,
hold
a
voir
dire
examination
regarding
the
visibility
of
the
document
or
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice

that
is
done
with
reference
to
a
request
to
produce
documents
that
ought
not
to
be
asked
to
be
produced
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
because
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
case
there's
a
declamation,
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
why
i
think
i
suggested,
yesterday,
the
difference
between
the
problem
that
arises
under
this
statute
and
the
problem
that
arise
on
the
motion
to
suppress
illegally
obtained
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
court
has
held
that
that
must
be
done
prior
to
the
trial
unless
the
exigency
arises
later.
knowledge
doesn't
--
hasn't
--
wasn't
available
or
could
not
have
been
made
available
before
the
trial
in
order
not
to
have
an
interruption
of
the
trial.
now,
in
this
situation,
i
take
it
that
cases
will
seldom
arise
that
this
could
be
--
indeed,
the
statute
forbids
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
cannot
be
done,
so
that
he
--
and
there
must
be
an
interruption
of
the
trial
and
there
may
be
a
lengthy
interruption
of
the
trial,
conflict
of
testimony,
long
cross-examination,
to
ascertain
the
conditions
under
which
the
subject
matter
of
what
the
document
contained,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
and
that
must
be
done
not
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
because
the
finding
is
a
judge's
finding,
as
all
admissibility
is
a
question
for
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
confessions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
three
of
the
cops
--
i
think,
when
you
said
that
--
when
you
agreed
that
there
are
certain
things
that
--
certain
relevant
evidence
that
congress
can
deny
to
the
defense,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
issue.
the
issue
isn't
whether
congress
may
deny
certain
evidence
relevant
to
a
fair
trial.
the
question
that
this
statute
raises
is
whether
congress
may
determine
the
means
by
determining
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
a
right
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what's
with
the
prosecutor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
this
case,
but
in
the
--
may
the
prosecutor
see
things
that
the
defendant
can't
see?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
not
prosecute
a
man
at
the
time
they're
not
known
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
may
not.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
an
issue
he
may
not
know
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
here,
yesterday,
that
he
did
not
see
these
documents.
here,
your
argument
in
this
case,
until
--
except
through
the
courtesy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
whatever
it
is,
of
our
clerk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
every
defendant
would
ask
to
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
meant
here
is
to
stress
that
--
the
prosecutor
may
not
know
of
the
existence
of
the
document
which
counsel
for
the
defendant
made
by
ferreting
questions
by
appropriate
cross-examination
exist
--
elicit
the
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
should
think
that
in
such
a
case,
if
i'm
wrong
in
such
a
case,
i
don't
know
if
the
prosecutor
should
be
allowed
to
see
it.
you
may
ask
--
you
may
produce
--
you
may
be
called
upon
to
produce
a
document
which
you
do
not
examine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he's
seen
it,
then
it's
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
doesn't
forbid
him
from
knowing
materials
in
his
own
--
in
his
own
preparation
for
a
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
held,
even
in
civil
cases,
you
can't
note
into
the
other
fellow's
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commentary
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
it
arrive
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
you.
you
just
said
that
the
judge's
charge
restricted
testimony
so
as
not
to
be
applicable
to
lev,
or
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
there
any
specific
restriction
of
carlin's
testimony
in
the
course
of
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
merely
in
the
final
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
specific
restriction
of
carlin's
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
such,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
have
been
included
in
some
omnibus
restriction,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
probably
know,
i
have
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
with
complaints
against
a
dragnet
character
of
conspiracy
charges,
but
that
isn't
before
us.
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
what
you
are
now
suggesting
is
that
the
confusion
attributable
to
two
conspiracies
which,
in
fact,
might
be
interpretable
as
one
would
have
made
it
difficult
for
the
jury
to
segregate
carlin's
testimony
so
as
to
allocate
it
in
part
to
white
hat
and
in
part
to
bonita.
that's
really
what
it
gets
down
to,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
difficulty
was
--
my
difficulty
is
to
the
openness
of
this
question
on
our
limited
cert.
that's
my
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judge
certainly
--
the
trial
court
certainly
told
the
jury
they
shouldn't
consider
a
certain
body
of
evidence
as
applicable
to
lev.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
ask
us
to
--
you
ask
us
to
read
the
record
that,
in
fact,
there
was
only
one
conspiracy.
it
was
so
blended
that
you
couldn't
segregate
it
when
we
specifically
refused
to
take
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
it
a
fact,
though,
in
the
event
that
the
provision
in
the
rule
--
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
relating
to
discovery
is
not
co-extended
or
doesn't
touch
the
same
subject
matter
as
the
subject
matter
of
this
statute.
in
other
words,
there's
discovery
as
to
all
sorts
of
thing
having
nothing
to
do
with
laying
the
foundation
for
impeachment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that,
under
the
rule
of
--
that
was
the
disputed
controversies
i
remember
reading
contemporaneously.
that,
today,
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion,
if
i
may
say
so,
in
the
minds
of
legislators
as
to
what
the
rule
of
discovery
was
and
they
did
not
want
this
statute
explicitly
to
impair
the
continuance
of
the
rule
regarding
discovery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
subject
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
didn't
--
doesn't
mean
that
they
passed
the
statute
which,
by
non-statement,
at
the
same
time,
destroyed
the
statute
that
they
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
would
be
the
effect
of
your
argument.
that
would
be
the
effect,
the
necessary
effect,
that
every
time
counsel
wanted
to
prove
that
it
was
not
within
what
you've
deemed
be
nonexclusive
provision,
they
would
ask
for
the
document
and
no
counsel
would
be
so
stupid
as
not
to
ask
for
the
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
have
shrieked
then
you
--
we
might
yet
have
dissented.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
have
shrieked
then
we
might
yet
have
dissented.[laughter]
