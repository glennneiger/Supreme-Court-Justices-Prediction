mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
are,
i
think,
two
before
you
in
addition
to
this
one.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pre-jencks
act
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pre-jencks
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
know
of,
i
think,
two
that
are
before
your
court.
i
don't
know
what
the
status
in
the
court
of
appeals
is.
now,
the
next
case,
the
valyermo
case,
is
a
case
which
was
tried
after
the
jencks
decision
and
after
the
jencks
statute,
and
it
involves,
again,
a
claim
that
what
was
denied
production
was
a
summary
of
a
part
of
the
government
witness'
testimony.
there
was
also
a
claim
in
that
case
that
if
the
--
if
the
refusal
of
the
production
of
the
document
was
error,
it
was
harmless
error.
the
third
case,
the
rosenberg
case
that
comes
from
the
third
circuit
is
also
a
post-jencks
act
and
post-jencks
decision
case.
it
was
tried
under
the
act.
in
our
view,
and
ms.
rosenberg
for
the
government
will
explain
it
further,
the
documents
which
are
involved
in
that
case
are
wholly
peripheral
because
the
trial
judge
said
that
he
went
beyond
the
statute
to
even
give
summaries.
so
that,
in
our
view,
what
is
involved
there
are
wholly
peripheral
documents
from
the
files
of
the
government.
and,
that
case
does
involve
the
f.b.i.,
the
palermo
case
which
is
an
income
tax
case.
the
palermo
case
would
be
the
next
succeeding
case.
it
involves
the
internal
revenue
service.
then,
the
third
and
fourth
cases,
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case
and
the
galax
case,
involved
grand
jury
testimony
which
is
all
to
produce
grand
jury
testimony.
as
to
which,
the
jencks
act
is
tangentially
relevant
but
not
directly
on
point.
and,
the
last
of
these
cases,
the
scales
case
which,
of
course,
involves
wholly
different
and
very
important
issues,
also
has
in
it
a
question
arising
under
the
jenks
act
because
the
retrial
of
scales
was
under
the
g
--
was
after
the
jencks
act
and,
therefore,
under
the
jencks
act.
and,
it
involves
the
question
of
the
excision
from
documents
which
were
produced
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel,
parts
of
the
documents
which
were
thought
by
the
government
and
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
irrelevant.
with
that
summary
statement
of
the
--
of
these
group
of
cases,
i
come
now
to
this
case
and
i
think
it
would
be
very,
very
helpful
if
i
set
forth
before
the
court,
a
little
more
directly
than
has
been
done,
the
type
of
facts
that
there
were
in
this
case.
now,
of
course,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
that
is
not
before
the
court,
but
it
has
a
very,
very
direct
bearing
on
the
impact
of
the
denial
of
this
document
relating
to
carlin
on
the
three
defendants
in
this
case
to
know
exactly
what
this
case
was
about.
as
has
been
pointed
out,
quite
fairly,
this
is
a
case
involving
a
fraud
in
procurement
involving
the
quartermaster
corps
in
--
the
so-called
quartermaster
corps
department
in
new
york
,in
16th
street
in
new
york.
it
involves
two
separate
types
of
procurement,
and
this
is
terribly
important
because
the
petitioner
lev
is
involved
only
in
the
second
one
of
these
procurements.
as
to
which,
as
i
shall
point
out
in
detail,
carlin
testified
nothing
at
all,
and
as
to
which
judge
kaufman,
many
times,
directed
the
jury
not
to
consider
any
testimony
as
to
petitioner
lev.
i
shall
try
to
spell
it
out
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
may
not
be
controlled
by
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
exactly
right,
mr
justice.
now,
the
two
types
of
procurement
that
were
involved
was,
first,
a
series
of
three
contracts
for
garrison
caps,
these
little
caps
that
soldiers
and
airmen
wear.
that
was
--
those
contracts
were
left
to
the
bonita
company,
the
bonita
originals
company,
as
to
which,
carlin
--
for
whom
carlin
was
the
accountant
for
a
period
of
about
nine
months
in
the
beginning
of
1952.
his
testimony
was
solely
as
to
the
b
--
to
the
bonita
contacts
and
contracts
with
the
quartermaster
corps.
he
--
he
did
not
mention
the
word
or
the
name
of
lev.
he
said
that
he
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
white
hat
procurement,
which
is
the
second
one
that
i'm
about
to
come
to.
as
to
which,
lev
was
the
dominant
factor.
now,
the
second
procurement
was
the
white
hat
procurement.
they
were
white
sailor
hats.
it
was
a
procurement
of
7
million
white
sailor
hats,
which
--
for
which,
lev
and
his
companies
had
the
contract.
now,
that
did
not
come
about
until
almost
a
year
after
the
garrison
cap
contracts.
it
started
about
the
beginning
of
1953
which
was
about
a
year
later,
long
after
carlin,
the
witness
in
controversy,
had
left
the
entire
transaction.
he
had
left
the
bonita
company
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
now,
it
is
also,
as
i
stress
because
it
is
terribly
important
that
we
believe
at
least
as
to
petitioner
lev,
that
throughout
the
trial
--
throughout
the
trial,
judge
kaufman
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
all
the
testimony
relating
to
the
bonita
company,
that
is,
the
garrison
cap
contracts,
was
not
to
be
considered
as
against
petitioner
lev
because
he
was
not
involved
in
that.
and,
throughout
his
charge
to
the
jury,
he
made
it
equally
clear.
in
fact,
when
the
jury
came
back
and
asked
some
questions
which,
to
his
mind,
indicated
that
there
might
be
some
doubt
in
their
mind
as
to
that,
he
repeated
again
that
none
of
the
bonita
testimony
was
to
be
considered
as
to
harry
lev.
and,
i
repeat
again
that
the
testimony
of
the
witness
carlin
was
wholly
and
solely
relating
to
the
bonita
contracts,
the
garrison
cap
contracts,
and
had
no
relation
whatsoever
to
the
white
hat
procurement,
the
sailor
hat
procurement
with
which
harry
lev
was
related.
now,
it
has
been
indicated,
but
i
think
not
brought
out
clearly
for
your
honors,
that
this
was
a
long
trial.
there
are
3,600
pages
of
testimony
and
the
entire
transcript
to
the
record
which
is
on
file
in
this
court
is
over
4,000
pages.
there
were
27
government
witnesses
and
a
number
of
defendant
witnesses,
including
testimony
by
the
defendant
rubin
who
is
a
petitioner
here
and
other
defendants
who
are
not
in
this
court
at
this
time.
i
would
stress,
too,
because
it's
important,
at
least
on
our
argument
upon
this
area,
that
there
was
an
extraordinary
amount
of
testimony
as
to
bribes
and
doing
of
pecuniary
favors
by
the
defendants
in
these
cases
before
the
quartermaster
corps.
the
witness
carlin
was,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
and
i
shall
try
if
i
have
time
to
point
it
out,
a
wholly
secondary
witness.
the
witness
levy
who
was
involved
in
the
bonita
conspiracy
and
also
had
knowledge
of
the
white
hat
conspiracy
was
a
very
detailed
witness
as
to
all
the
elements
of
the
--
both
aspects
of
the
conspiracy,
and
he
detailed
the
large
number
of
bribes
and
favors
which
were
done.
there
were
--
in
addition
to
the
witness
levy,
there
were
government
officials
who
had
been
themselves
participants
in
this
entire
conspiracy.
there
was
not
on
the
full
record
the
chief
inspector
who
did
favors
for
these
people
as
a
result
of
a
bribe
of
$1000
by
harry
lev
and
other
moneys
by
the
and
--
by
the
other
defendants.
but,
there
were
inspectors
who
testified,
as
well,
of
what
they
did
in
this
relationship.
i
say
this
because
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that,
in
the
government's
view,
this
--
the
testimony
of
carlin
was
very
secondary.
he
was
one
of
the
witnesses.
he
was
actually
the
second
witness.
but,
as
the
trial
progressed,
the
weight
of
the
testimony
was
overwhelming
and
i
think
i
should
say
right
now,
and
i'll
try
to
come
back
to
it,
that
we
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
perfectly
well
applicable
the
language
which
the
court
used
a
few
terms
ago
in
the
lochlet
case.
this
is
a
record
that
barely
shrieks
of
guilt.
there
was
also
testimony,
and
this
is
important,
by
third
parties,
in
addition
to
carlin,
the
bookkeeper
in
the
establishment
of
the
bonita
company
who
corroborated
much
of
what
carlin
said,
other
people
who
were
wholly
unconnected
with
the
conspiracy
who
corroborated
what
was
done
and,
finally,
there
were
admissions
by
the
defendants
of
payments
which,
of
course,
they
thought
were
not
bribes
but
mere
personal
favors
or
for
other
purposes.
but,
there
were
admissions
by
the
defendant
of
clear
payments
to
the
government
officials
involved.
now,
with
this
background,
i
come
to
make
a
summary
statement,
first,
of
what
i
hope
to
present
to
the
court
in
my
argument.
i
think
i
may
have
made
it
clear
that,
in
our
view,
the
denial
of
the
production
of
this
document
relating
to
carlin
has
--
had
not
relation
whatsoever
to
the
petitioner
lev
and,
therefore,
regardless
of
what
might
be
done
as
to
the
other
petitioners,
the
petitioner
lev's
conviction
cannot
be
reversed
or
any
action
taken
with
relation
to
that.
as
to
petitioner
wool,
carl
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir,
because
if
we
are
right
on
all
the
other,
that
might
be
the
most
narrow
ground
as
far
as
petitioner
lev.
but,
even
wholly
apart
from
that,
we
will
of
course
make
the
argument
of
what
was
done
here
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
perfectly
correct.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
did
in
his
petition
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
the
court
limited,
as
to
this,
that
that's
all
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
will
also
try
to
establish
that
this
trial
was
not,
as
counsel
have
tried
to
say,
permeated
by
the
refusal
of
judge
kaufman
to
allow
the
production
of
this
testimony.
my
reading,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
of
the
pretrial
discussion
on
the
objections
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
that
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners.
my
reading
of
the
pretrial
discussion
about
objections
was
that
the
then-counsel
for
lev
made
some
suggestion
about
one
objection
by
one
defendant
standing
for
all
and
there
were
queries
as
to
that
by
the
other
defendants.
and
so,
judge
kaufman
said
"alright,
we
will
go
ahead
and
have
every
defendant
make
his
objection
as
he
sees
fit,"
and
that
is
actually
what
happened
in
this
trial
record.
there
are
indications
even
in
the
printed
record
and
the
unprinted
transcript
which
i
have,
in
a
large
part,
read
and
the
rest
scanned
is
just
--
is
filled
with
theoriative
objections
by
the
various
counsels
all
along
the
line
--
of
various
counsels
for
the
various
defendants
all
along
the
line,
so
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
i
recall
the
discussion,
there
was
no
agreement
as
to
--
a
demand
for
production
as
to
--
by
one
defendant
standing
for
all.
the
discussion
was
as
to
objections
to
testimony,
and
that
was
the
course
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
intend
to
but,
following
the
--
the
court's
injunctions,
i
think,
perhaps,
that
my
first
obligation
is
to
discuss
the
so-called
jencks
act
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
if
--
if
we
are
wrong
as
to
that,
then
we
don't
even
reach
any
constitutional
issue.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
that
connection,
if
--
if
you
will
allow
me
just
to
state,
in
summary
fashion,
what
our
view
is
on
the
constitution,
i
think
i
will
then
come
to
it
at
greater
length.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
understand.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
i'm
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
no,
sir.
i
should
think
that
this
statute
is
exactly
the
other
way.
the
government
can
be
compelled
to
produce
statements
which
the
other
side
can't
be
compelled
to
produce
under
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
had
not
heard
it
before.
in
summary,
mr.
justice
black,
our
position
is
that
congress
has
the
right
to
decide
that
a
non-verbatim
statement
or
that
statums
--
statements
which
cannot
appropriately
be
attributed
to
the
witness
because
they
are
not
approved
by
the
witness
or
adopted
by
the
witness
or
not
signed
by
the
witness
or
not
substantially
verbatim
recordings
of
what
the
witness
has
said
are
not
relevant
documents
and,
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
but
it
w
--
for
the
--
they
can't
be
t
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
but,
it
has
never
been
thought,
for
instance,
that
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
bring
notes
that
he
may,
in
advance
of
his
own,
not
as
a
result
of
discussions
with
any
government
agent
or
not,
just
notes
that
he
made
for
his
own
use
in
the
course
of
the
--
remembering
what
happened,
which
are
certainly,
in
the
broadest
dictionary
sense,
relevant
but
they
are
not
relevant
in
the
legal
sense.
i
shall
hope
to
come
back
to
that.
also,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
may
get
one
thing
out
of
the
way,
although,
i
think
it
is
now
clear.
the
government's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
contains
printed
reproductions
of
the
two
affidavits,
one
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
one
of
the
senate
investigator.
and,
a
footnote
in
the
government's
brief
says
“the
end
of
this
brief
are
printed
these
exhibits
which
are
the
affidavits,
and
the
original
would
be
handed
up
to
the
court
at
the
time
of
oral
argument,
so
that,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
affidavits
were
not
made
available
to
the
court
of
appeals
prior
to
being
made
available
to
counsel
for
the
petitioners.
the
significant
part,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
and
i
shall
say
at
this
point,
i
forgot
to
mention
before,
that
the
rosenberg
case,
the
third
of
these
cases,
is
the
only
one
that
involves
any
question
of
pretrial
production
--
pretrial
production.
and,
ms.
rosenberg
for
the
government
will
deal
with
that
in
that
case.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
significant
portion
of
the
statute
has
already
been
brought
out
by
justice
frankfurter.
it
is
on
page
6
of
the
government's
brief.
it's
the
portion
labeled
“subsection
(e),”
and
i
won't
take
the
court's
time
to
go
over
it.
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear,
as
the
legislative
history
reveals
in
great
detail,
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
was
to
per
--to
require
the
government
to
produce
only
those
statements
for
which
the
witness
is
said
to
be
fairly
responsible,
which
were
his
statement.
and,
therefore,
which
--
for
which
--
which
could
probably
be
used
in
examining
and
cross-examining
him
and
that,
contrary-wise,
the
purpose
of
the
provision
of
the
statute
was
not
to
require
the
government
to
produce
other
types
of
documents
which
could
not
fairly
be
tied
to
the
witness,
which
could
fairly
--
not
fairly
be
said
to
be
the
statement
of
the
witness.
now,
in
our
view,
this
is
what
the
court
held
in
the
jencks
case.
in
the
jencks
case,
the
court
had
before
it
some
written
statements
which
were
clearly
the
statements
of
matusow
and
ford,
the
crucial
government
witnesses
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
the
court
had
before
it
the
written
statements?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
ford,
yes,
you're
right,
mr.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
were
no
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
government
made
no
claim
in
those
cases
and
i
have
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
start
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
they
were
not
summaries
of
the
type
of
this
--
of
this
statement
here.
they
were,
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned,
pretty
substantially
verbatim
recordings
of
what
ford
had
told
the
government
agents,
the
f.b.i.
and
what
matusow,
because
there
were
some
oral
statements
as
to
matusow,
too.
the
government
made
no
claim
whatsoever
that
those
were
not
properly
attributable
to
ford
and
to
matusow,
a
claim
that
we
do
make
here
and
that
we
make
any
other
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
far
as
i
know,
i
don't
know
whether
he
did
or
not
but
i
do
know,
by
having
check
the
government's
briefs
and
the
documents
that
we
filed
in
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
argument,
i
don't
recall
the
oral
argument,
that
the
government
never
made
any
claim
that
the
--
that
the
statements
were
not
fairly
attributable
to
those
two
witnesses.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
did
he?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
they
were
recorded
by
the
f.b.i.
but,
as
the
statute
itself
says,
a
substantially
verbatim
recording
of
an
oral
statement
is
properly
attributable
to
the
witness,
and
this
is
the
position
that
the
government
took
or
the
position
that
the
government
assumed
with
respect
to
those
statements
in
that
--
in
that
case.
and,
also,
in
the
companion
cases
of
scales
and
lightwood,
i
think,
there
were
written
statements
in
each
one
of
those,
too.
but,
that
--
and
our
understanding
of
the
holding
of
the
court
as
to
that
is
that
the
court
assumed,
one,
that
the
statement
were
relevant
in
the
sense
that
they
touched
upon
the
testimony
of
the
witness
and
were
n
--
didn't
contain
irrelevant
matter
and
the
government
didn't
claim
otherwise
and,
two,
that
they
were
recordings
by
the
f.b.i.,
faithful
recordings
by
the
f.b.i.,
of
the
oral
statements
made
by
those
two
witnesses.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,no
i
do
not
mean
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
mean,
that
they
were
s
--
what
might
be
said
to
be
substantially
verbatim
recordings
of
the
--
by
long
--
well,
shall
i
say,
longhand
methods.
so,
they
were
not,
so
far
as
i
know,
mechanical
recording,
though
i'm
not
even
certain
as
to
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
would
not
claim
that
if
the
f.b.i.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
really
know.
i
have
never
seen
them,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
claim
that
the
government
made
in
that
c
--
we
did
not
claim
in
that
case
that
these
statements
are
anything
other
than
faithful
recordings
of
what
had
been
told.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
can't
say
from
my
own
knowledge.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
all
i'm
really
saying
is
what
issue
was
presented
to
the
court
and
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice.
what
i
was
referring
to
was
the
issue
which
was
presented
to
the
court.
no
issue
was
made
as
to
that
because
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
suggest
that
the
government
did
not
make
any
claim
that
there
was
in
the
ford
--
in
the
ford
situation,
the
claim
that
it
makes
key.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
saying
that
the
only
issue
with
respect
to
this
--
to
this
point
was
--
it
was
assumed
that
these
were
faithful
recordings,
as
it
was
assumed
that
they
were
relevant
and,
so,
that
the
issue
--
the
decision
of
the
case
was
directed
to
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
verbatim.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
take
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
all
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
the
government
made
no
claim
in
that
case,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
that
these
were
not
faithful
recordings,
nor
do
they
claim
that
that
they
weren't
relevant
to
the
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know.
i
know
i
don't
think
they
were
ford's
longhand
statements.
i
don't
know
if
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
what
the
agent
did,
whether
he
took
down
over
the
telephone
in
longhand
what
ford
is
telling
him,
as
it
has
been
done
in
some
of
our
cases.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
any
way,
that
is
the
view
of
the
jencks
decision
which
was
taken
by
the
department
of
justice,
by
a
number
of
federal
courts
though,
as
i
shall
say,
not
by
all,
and
by
the
members
of
congress
when
the
bill
came
before
them.
after
the
jencks
decision,
there
were,
as
the
court
is
aware,
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions
which,
in
the
view
of
the
department
and,
subsequently,
came
to
be
the
view
of
congress,
extended
the
jencks
decision
or
found
implications
in
the
jencks
decision
which,
in
our
view,
where
not
there.
extended
it
to
pretrial
matters,
extended
it
to
requiring
the
production
on
entire
government
files
regardless
of
the
relevancy
of
the
materials,
even
extended
to
quashing
post
c
--
after
conviction,
quashing
convictions
even
though
no
demand
for
production
had
been
made.
as
a
result
of
this
cropping
up
of
lower
court
cases,
suggestion
was
made
by
the
department
of
justice
to
the
congress
that
a
bill
should
be
enacted
which
would
incorporate
the
rule
of
the
jencks
case,
as
we
understood
it,
and
would
also
set
the
confines
of
the
so-called
jencks
doctrine
so
that
there
would
be,
in
the
future,
no
reason
for
doubt
as
to
what
types
of
production
of
documents
relating
to
government
witnesses
should
be
produced
in
federal
criminal
trial.
i
think
that
it
may
help
if
i
say
that
there
were
four
purposes
of
the
statute,
which
are
revealed
not
only
by
the
presentation
by
the
department
of
justice,
which
was
the
initial
moving
factor,
but
which
are
revealed
by
the
entire
legislative
history
of
the
committee
reports
and
the
debates
on
the
floor
of
both
houses
of
congress.
and,
the
first
of
those
purposes
was
to
accept
the
jencks
decision
as
it
was
understood,
that
is,
authenticated
documents
of
the
witnesses
were
to
be
produced
by
the
government
for
impeachment
purposes.
the
legislative
history,
both
the
reports
and
the
debates,
are
filled
with
the
use
of
the
word
“authenticated
documents,”
with
the
use
of
the
word
“confident
documents,”
that
is,
documents
which
would
be
admissible
in
evience
if
it
turns
out
that
they
did
contain
impeaching
material.
that
is
very
clear.
but,
the
second
and
opposing
point
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
that
which
isn't
--
is
to
be
produced
which,
in
form,
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
if
the
contents
were
impeaching,
that
is,
if
it
contained
inconsistent
matter
or
show
bias
or
something
like
that.
but,
nothing
is
to
be
produced
which
isn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
in
our
view,
the
jencks
decision
had
to
do
with
authenticated
documents,
authenticated
documents
which
were
really
tied
up
with
the
which
--
the
witness
could
be
held
properly
responsible.
so
that,
when,
on
cross-examination,
the
witness
was
asked
“didn't
you
say
such-and-such?”
you
would
have
a
document,
on
the
basis
of
which,
it
would
properly
be
said
that
the
witness
did
say
that
such-and-such
to
the
agent.
the
jencks
decision
made
a
distinction
between
admissible
in
evidence
and
that
which
should
be
produced.
but,
what
i'm
saying
now
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
a
signed
statement
would
have
to
be
produced
even
though
it
contained
nothing
inconsistent,
that
is,
even
when
the
defense
counsel
saw
he
wasn't
able
to
conjure
up
the
slightest
degree
of
inconsistency
and,
of
course,
that
would
not
be
admissible
in
evidence.
if
i
may
make
myself
clear,
it's
the
form
of
the
statement
which
is
important
for
production.
is
it
an
authenticated
statement?
if
the
contents
of
the
statement
which
are
important
for
admission
into
ele
--
into
evidence,
does
it
contain
inconsistent
material?
does
it
show
bias?
it
can't
be
admitted
into
evidence
under
the
rule
--
on
the
rules
of
evidence
unless
the
content
showed
that
it
has
an
impeaching
character.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
c
--
perfectly
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
know
of
no
situation,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
which
it
would
be
admissible
if
it
were
not
authenticated
by
the
witness
in
some
way.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
but
it
would
also
not
be
admissible
in
evidence
if
it
were
produced
because
it
would
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
there
an
awful
lot
of
things,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
can
be
used
by
the
defense
in
cross-examination
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
they
happen
to
get
them,
which
they
can't
compel
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
government
to
produce.
and,
the
theory
of
this
statute
is
that
the
government
should
be
compelled
to
produce
those
things
which
can
properly
be
used
in
cross-examination
because
the
document
really
stands
for
what
the
witness
said.
now,
if
i
may
get
ahead
of
myself
a
little
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,no
sir.
no
it
isn't
formed
in
that
substance
because,
as
we
all
know,
there
are
many
documents
written
up
by
other
people
which
do
not
properly
reproduce
what
we
say
at
all.
i
think
we
all
know
that
from
our
experience
with
newspaper
reports.
we
all
know
that
from
memoranda
of
conferences
that
we
have
held.
i
have
seen
any
number
of
memoranda
and
i
really
think
that
the
justices
have,
too,
in
which
there
had
been
summarized
what
the
participants
said
in
which
participants
would
say
“i
didn't
say
that
or,
if
i
did
say
that,
i
qualified
it
in
this
way.”
so
that,
it
is
not
an
appropriate
real
summary
of
what
went
on.
if
i
may
make
this
suggestion,
there
is
a
very
estimable
publication
that
purports
to
publish
verbatim
transcripts
of
some
of
the
oral
arguments
in
this
court,
but
i
have,
several
times,
seen
reports
of
arguments
in
which
i
participated
and
which
what
i
thought
had
been
an
answer
to
a
justice's
question
of
several
hundred
words,
fall
down
to
the
word
“yes
or
no”
in
the
reports
of
the
united
states
law.
and,
these
are
--
this
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
which
was
known
to
congress,
too,
that
there
are
many
types
of
summaries
or
memoranda
of
conferences
or
interviews
which
contain
omissions
in
which
the
interviewer
is
interested
in
one
thing
and
fails
to
include
qualifications
or
important
matters
which
the
interviewee,
the
perspective
or
potential
witness,
thinks
are
important.
so
that,
what
you
have
in
a
case
like
that
is
not
an
authenticated
document.
you
have
something
as
to
which
you
can't
tell
how
much
is
the
product
of
the
interviewer
and
how
much
is
the
product
of
the
interviewee.
and,
before
you
can
really
say
to
the
interviewee
for
impeachment
purpose,
which
is
the
only
real
use
that
this
may
properly
be
made
in
federal
criminal
trials,
“didn't
you
make
a
prior
contradictory
statement?”
you
have
to
separate
out
that
part
of
the
statement
which
is
the
interviewer's
addition
and
that
part
of
it
which
is
the
true
statement
of
the
interviewee.
and,
the
judgment
that
congress
made
was
that
this
can't
properly
be
done
unless
you
have
the
kind
of
statements
which
are
included
in
subsection
(e)
of
the
jencks
act.
and,
of
course,
our
position
is
that
that's
a
reasonable
position
which
congress
had
the
right
to
adopt
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
law
in
this
field
and
on
the
basis
of
the
common
knowledge
and
experience
which
congress,
along
with
all
the
rest
of
us,
has.
but,
before
i
come
to
that,
i'd
like
to
make
sure
that
your
honors
understand
that
that
is
what
congress
did
because
there
has
been
some
claim
that
congress
did
not
do
what
i
said,
that
it
did
not
limit
the
jencks
act
to
authenticated
documents
or
authenticated
statements.
and,
that
these
words
do
not
mean
what
they
appear
on
their
surface
to
mean.
i
did
not
get
the
opportunity
to
tell
the
court
that,
in
the
mind
of
congress,
wasn't
there
not
only
the
acceptance
of
what
it
understood
as
the
true
jencks
doctrine
but
also
the
converse,
that
is,
it
wanted
to
prevent
the
revealing
to
the
defendant
and
the
defendant's
counsel
of
investigative
reports
by
the
f.b.i.
and
by
other
investigative
agencies
which
contained
a
lot
of
material
which
congress
thought
should
not
be
made
available
to
the
defense.
that
is
the
names
of
certain
confidential
informants,
the
names
of
investigative
techniques,
irrelevant
material,
comments
on
wholly
third
party,
some
of
whom
were
innocent
and
some
of
whom
leads
as
to
further
criminal
investigation.
all
types
of
unverified
information
leave
an
impression.
that
is,
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
to
prevent
this
type
of
material
from
being
made
available
to
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
to
the
defendants
because,
as
i
said,
congress
thought
this
is
the
kind
of
material
they
had
no
right
to
see
and
which
they
could
not
properly
use
in
criminal
trials.
and,
as
i
have
already
indicated,
too,
congress
did
want
to
prevent,
for
the
reasons
i
have
summarized,
the
production
of
unauthenticated
incompetent
documents,
documents
which
really
could
not
be
properly
used
in
court
to
impeach
the
witness'
own
testimony
because
you
wouldn't
know
whether
it
was
the
witness'
statement
that
was
being
used
or
whether
it
was
someone
else's,
some
third
party's,
the
agent's,
the
interviewer's.
the
history
of
the
statute,
i
think,
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
congress
was
intending
to
establish
an
exclusive
procedure,
that
is,
that
this
procedure
was
to
be
the
procedure
used
in
all
federal
criminal
trials
thereafter.
there
was
no
effort
by
congress
to
establish
an
alternative
procedure.
and,
what
shall
i
say,
judicial
procedures
could
be
added
onto
the
exclusive
procedure
which
congress
adopted.
we
have
not
extended
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
they
could
not
be.
we
did
not
exclu
--
extensively
brief
this
in
any
of
this
cases
because
we
thought
it
was
absolutely
clear,
from
the
reading
of
the
legislative
history,
it's
the
basic
posture
of
the
entire
legislative
history
that
this
procedure
was
to
be
exclusive
but,
since
the
petitioners
have
challenged
the
issue,
i
want
to
read
a
couple
of
sentences
to
the
court
from
the
committee
reports
to
substantiate
our
position
that
this
was
to
be
the
exclusive
procedur.
the
senate
report
of
august
15,
1957
says
the
purpose
of
the
proposed
legislation
is
to
amend
the
united
states
code
to
provide
the
exclusive
procedure
for
handling
demands
for
the
production
of
statements
and
reports
of
witnesses.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
page
49.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
then
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
if
they
were
statements
made
to
government
agents
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
language
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(b)
was
deleted
and,
as
indicated
on
the
end
of
subsection
(a)
on
page
4,
it
provides
that
no
statements
or
reports
are
to
be
produced,
and
this
is
the
end
of
subsection
(a),
until
said
witness
has
testified
on
direct-examination
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
and
then,
the
very
next
sentence,
the
very
beginning
of
(b)
said
“after
a
witness
called
by
the
united
states
has
testified
on
direct-examination,”
and
then
there
is
“prescribed
procedure
was
just
to
be
followed.”
i
will
say
that
i
have
read
very
carefully
the
--
several
times,
the
debate
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
on
the
conference
bill,
as
well
as
the
report
of
the
managers
of
the
house,
and
i
see
not
there
the
slightest
inference
or
the
slightest
suggestion
that
the
exclusivity
which
was
clear
before
was
no
longer
to
be
the
case.
in
fact
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
was
simply
a
change
in
wording
to
make
it
clear
that
no
statements
of
any
type,
not
even
the
authenticated
statements
of
any
type,
were
to
be
produced
until
the
trial.
there
was
a
very
great
debate,
as
your
honor
may
recall,
as
to
pretrial
discovery,
which
i
won't
go
into
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
to
(b),
(c),
and
(d)?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
reason
for
that
is
what
i
was
just
adverting
to,
mr.
justice.
congress
wanted
to
provide
that
no
types
of
statement,
even
unauthenticated
statements,
could
be
produced
prior
to
trial,
and
so,
if
they
had
limited,
if
they
had
made
(e)
effective
as
to
(a),
what
they
would
have
provided
is
that
only
authenticated
statements
should
not
be
produced
and
left
a
gap
as
to
unauthenticated
statements.
i'm
not
certain
if
i'm
making
myself
clear.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
congress
wanted
across
the
board
to
say
that
no
types
of
statement,
even
including
authenticated
statements,
were
to
be
produced
prior
to
trial.
so,
they
had
to
have
the
broadest
type
of
definition
of
the
word
“statements
or
report”
or
they
wouldn't
succeed
in
fulfilling
that
purpose
which
they
had,
so
that
they
could
not
use
a
limited
definition
of
the
word
“statement”
with
relation
to
(a)
as
they
do
later
on
when
they
come
to
what's
to
be
produced
at
the
trial.
they
wanted
it
to
provide
that
all
types
of
statements
should
not
be
produced
prior
to
trial,
all
types
authenticated,
unauthenticated,
summaries,
competent,
whatever
type.
and,
we
think
that's
the
clear
explanation
of
why
congress
did
what
it
did
in
limiting
the
definition
of
statement
to
the
post-tri
--
or
the
midst
of
trial
provisions
of
the
jencks
act.
now,
the
conference
report
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
a
reference
on
the
debate
in
--
on
the
conference
bill
by
senator
keating
that
--
who
was
a
member
of
the
conference
committee
that
only
statements
which
need
be
produced
are
the
authenticated
statements.
this
was
the
--
and
senator
dirksen
had
earlier
said,
not
on
the
conference
report
but
earlier
in
the
senate,
that
we
have
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
then,
our
position
is,
after
the
witness
had
testified,
only
what
i
have
described
as
authenticated
statements
were
to
be
produced.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
the
theory
was
that
it
sh
--
it's
terribly
important
to
know
whether
the
so-called
impeaching
document
is
relevant,
bears,
or
touches
on,
i
don't
want
the
use
the
word
“relevant,”
bears
or
touches
on
the
testimony
of
the
witness
on
direct-examination.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
what
usually
happen
is
that,
immediately
after
the
end
of
the
direct-examination
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
it
may
be
at
the
bench.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
has
not
actually
turned
out
to
be
the
practice
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
practice
is
that
a
motion
is
made
at
the
end
of
the
witness'
direct
testimony
and
the
government
hands
over
everything
which
it
believes
to
be
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
does
not,
unless
it
has
doubt,
that
is,
if
it
isn't
certain
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
would
it
--
the
things
that
it
doesn't
handover,
it
may
hand
to
the
judge
to
look
at,
s
--
to
see
whether
it
falls
within
the
jencks
statute.
if
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
may
but,
in
most
cases,
it
has
not
because
the
judge
has
been
enabled
to
make
a
determination
by
an
inspection
of
the
document
that
it
is
clearly
not
within
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
can't
speak
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but,
in
most
case
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
occasionally,
you
may.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
congress
has
laid
down
some
guide
posts.
it
has
given
the
words
of
the
statute
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
i
think
you
can
tell
by
internal
inspection
of
the
document
which,
of
course,
i
have
seen
only
because
it
was
made
available
to
me
by
the
clerk
of
this
court,
but
i
think
you
can
tell
from
an
internal
inspection
of
the
document
that
it
contains
the
impressions
of
the
interviewer
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
talking
about
this
document.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
are
many
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
and
that's
why
congress
provided
that
it
should
be,
not
only
a
substantially
verbatim
recital,
but
recorded
it
contemporaneously.
that's
in
the
statute,
“recorded
it
contemporaneously.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
you
can
sometimes
tell
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
can't
invariably
tell
it
but,
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
what
the
practice
has
been,
but
i
do
know
this.
that,
in
many
cases,
courts
have
been
able
to
determine,
from
an
inspection
of
the
document
plus
such
evidence
as
we
have
in
this
case,
the
statement
by
the
--
by
the
interviewer
that
it
was
not
approved
by
the
witness
and
that
it
was
not
signed
by
him
and
adopted
by
him
and,
also,
that
it
was
a
general
summary,
plus
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
an
internal
inspection
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
there
are
three
things
to
be
said
about
this,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i'll
try
to
explain
each
of
them.
first,
this
is
a
unique
situation.
this
was
a
case
in
which
it
was
tried
before
the
jencks
decision
under
a
rule
of
law
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
which
was,
later,
disapproved.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
were
not
asked
to
--
to
do
that.
if
i
may
use
an
analogy
from
civil
procedure,
we
have
a
summary
judgment
proceeding
in
which,
if
one
party
says
this
is
--
these
are
the
facts
and
the
other
party
doesn't
come
in
and
deny
them
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
belavan
was
--
was
available
to
them.
they
could
question
him.
they
could
ask
that
he
be
called.
if
they
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
what
was
said
here
was
not
accurate,
they
didn't
do
that.
carlin
was
available
to
them,
to
query
as
to
whether
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
a
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
inevitable,
mr.--
mr.
justice
brennan.
congress
has
provided
that
they
shouldn't
see
statements
of
a
certain
kind.
in
fact,
under
certain
--
under
judicial
rules,
when
you
ask
for
discovery,
the
courts
decide
that
you
can't
see
statements
of
certain
kinds.
on
the
other
hand,
they
have
a
right
to
see
statements
of
other
kinds.
if
you
allow
them
to
see
it,
they
are
--
you're
--
they
are
getting
precisely
the
advantage
that
congress
has
said
they
are
not
allowed
to
have.
now,
the
only
way,
as
judge
learned
hand
said,
to
resolve
this
situation
is
to
have
--
unless
you
have
the
prosecutor
do
it
on
his
own,
is
to
have
the
judge
do
it,
informed
as
best
he
may
be
by
inspection,
by
whatever
evidence
is
available,
and
that
is
the
procedure
which
congress
adopted
in
jencks.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice.
but,
we
think
that
it
follows
by
very
clear
analogy
because
congress
has
said
that,
if
it
isn't
authenticated
statement,
it
is
not
to
be
handed
over.
as
i
mentioned
before,
someone
has
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
might
in
certain
cases,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
in
certain
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because,
if
it
isn't,
then
the
defendant
will
get
precisely
the
statement
which
congress
said
he
shall
not
get.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
he
will
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
see
everything.
he
see
--
he
will
--
if
congress
has
said
he
shall
not
get
an
unauthenticated
statement
and
you
let
him
always
look
at
it
to
see
whether
it
is
authenticated
or
unauthenticated,
he
has
seen
what
congress
has
said
he
shall
see
and
he,
of
course,
would
be
able
to
use
it
because
it
will
be
in
the
mind
of
the
defense
counsel
and
the
defendant.
and
there
--
if
i
may
adopt
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
comment,
the
statute
would
not
have
any
--
any
purpose.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
has
certain
opportunity.
it's
a
limited
opportunity.
he
could
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
could
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
for
instance,
he
can
say
an
authenticated
statement
is
a
statement
which
does
not
contain
explicit
expressions
of
the
interviewer.
if
you
--
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
page
37,
where
we
quote
what
judge
moore
said
in
the
anderson
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
case
prior
to
the
jencks
statute
and
which
congress
explicitly
adopted,
the
conference
committee
report
of
the
house
manager
said,
“we
believe
that
judge
moore's
statement
in
the
anderson
case
is
the
statement
that
should
be
followed
here.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
like
to
take
up,
in
the
remaining
time
that
i
have
at
my
disposal,
the
constitutional
questions,
both
those
relating
to
in
camera
inspection
and
those
relating
to
the
sixth
and
fifth
amendments.
and,
i
should
also
like
to
spend
a
little
while,
if
i
may,
on
the
question
of
harmless
error
as
it
relates
to
this
particular
case.
first,
on
the
subject
of
in
camera
inspection,
there
are
three
aspects
of
that
problem
that
may
arise
in
--
in
a
trial.
the
first
is
that
you
may
have
a
statement
which
is
admittedly
an
authenticated
statement
which
admittedly,
at
least
in
part,
touches
upon
the
testimony
of
the
witness
but
contains,
in
the
view
of
the
government,
irrelevant
material.
now,
congress
has
provided
in
subsection
(c)
of
18
u.s.c.
3500
that,
in
those
circumstances,
the
judge
is
to
excise
the
irrelevant
materials,
preserving
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
appellate
court.
now,
there
are
two
other
types
of
situations
in
which
a
similar
comparable
problem
may
arise.
the
government
may
say
“we
don't
have
any
statement
of
the
witness
which
is
producible
under
the
statute
at
all,
such
as
in
this
case
and
the
next
case.”
and,
the
third
type
of
situation
is
the
government
may
say
“yes,
we
have
a
statement
of
the
witness
signed,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
at
all
and
it
has
no
relationship.
it
doesn't
touch
upon
the
testimony
of
the
witness
at
this
trial.”
now,
in
each
of
those
three
situations,
we
think
that
the
--
a
proper
procedure
is
for
the
judge
to
make
an
in
camera
inspection
to
determine
whether
the
statement
is
producible
and,
if
it
is
producible,
whether
certain
portions
of
it
should
be
excised.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
just
coming
right
to
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
to
that
point
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
mr.
justice.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
think
that,
in
many
instances,
you
can
tell
from
an
examination
on
a
face
of
a
document
that
it
is
not
producible.
for
instance,
as
will
appear,
i
believe,
in
the
next
case,
if
it
appears
that
the
interview
with
the
potential
or
perspective
witness
took
three
hours
and
the
document
has
55
lines
in
it,
you
would
think
that
it
would
not
be
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
what
went
on
at
that
interview.
or,
if
the
document,
on
its
face,
contains
statements
by
the
agent
that
the
potential
witness
was
evasive
or
lying
or
--
or
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
about,
you
would
know
that
that
was
not
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
or,
similarly,
if
the
document
contained
a
material
that
didn't
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
witness
at
all,
material
that
clearly
and
obviously
came
from
some
other
person,
a
third
person,
but
someone
else
told
the
agent
about
the
witness
or
what
someone
--
what
the
agent
learned
about
the
matters
in
controversy
from
some
third
person,
you
would
know
that
that
was
not
a
statement
of
the
witness.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
a
statement
by
the
agent.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
i
do
--
i
don't
think
that
that
statement
would
be
producible
because
it
is
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recording
of
what
the
witness
said,
unless
the
judge,
on
inquiry,
and
that's
the
next
point
i'm
coming
to,
in
the
normal
case,
the
agent
--
the
witness
is
on
the
stand.
carlin
is
on
the
stand.
the
defense
attorney
can
question
carlin,
“did
you
give
a
statement?
did
you
give
a
written
statement?
did
you
see
one
that
was
written
up
by
the
agent?
what
did
you
tell
the
agent?
was
the
agent
taking
notes?
was
there
a
shorthand
reporter
there?
was
there
a
recording
machine?”
in
the
ordinary
case,
that's
--
that
type
of
questioning
is
available
to
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
our
point
simply,
mr.
justice
brenan
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
it
were
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital,
yes.
now,
i
think
that
i
can
try
to
cover
what
may
be
in
your
mind
as
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
there
are
ways
that
that
can
be
handled,
we
think,
without
--
outside
of
the
statute.
first
place,
you
can
cross-examine
carlin
as
to
what
he
said.
second
place,
it's
always
possible
to
call
the
agent
to
the
stand
if
there's
suspicion
foundation
laid
for
that.
if
you
have
--
you
can
say
to
the
judge
“this
is
an
important
issue
not
collateral
to
the
case,
but
it's
very
important.
it's
central
to
this
case.
i
would
like
to
call
the
agent
to
the
stand
to
see
what
carlin
did
say
to
the
agent,
from
the
agent's
recollection.”
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
if
you
call
the
agent,
i
think
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
have
the
agent's
memorandum
produced
because
it's
the
agent's
own
memorandum
in
that
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
maybe
even
under
the
statute,
that
the
agent's
own
--
see,
it
will
no
longer
be
an
unauthenticated
document.
it
will
be
the
agent's
own
document,
so
that
it
will
be
attributable
to
the
agent,
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
producible
probably
under
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
short
of
my
answer,
mr.
justice,
is
that
congress
has
not,
in
our
view,
denied
the
production
to
the
defense
of
unquestionably
relevant
material.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
paper
itself
would
not
be
because
it's
merely
the
statement
by
the
interviewer,
the
agent,
of
what
he
recalled
of
what
the
witness
said.
now,
you
might
be
able
very
well
to
call
the
wit
--
the
agent
to
the
stand
and
have
the
agent
examined
on
what
the
witness
told
him
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
suppose
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
--
if
the
agent
lied,
mr.
justice,
the
sanctions
of
perjury
are
available.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
suggesting,
too,
that
when
the
agent
is
on
the
stand,
the
memorandum
is
his
memorandum
and
is
producible
at
that
time.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
not
an
ordinary
situation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
the
situation
then
would
be
the
--
exactly
the
same
as
when
a
witness
has
died
or
disappeared,
the
witness
who
may
be
terribly
important
to
the
defense
of
the
case
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
not
want
to
say
that,
mr.
justice,
but
certainly
that's
not
a
case
we
have
here.
that's
a
tangential
peripheral
case
which
may
or
may
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
but
i
would
certainly
not
want
to
carry
the
burden
of
saying
that,
in
some
extraordinary
situation
where
it
may
be
this
was
whether
there
was
no
other
possible
way
of
getting
hold
of
it,
that
there
might
not
be
exceptions
read
into
the
statute.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
normal
ordinary
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
think
you're
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
reading
it
into
the
statute.
what
i'm
--
what
--
as
in
many
cases,
statutes
have
explicit
or
implicit
exceptions
or
conditions
read
into
it
in
order
to
meet
possibly
unforeseen
circumstances.
but,
the
statute
itself
is
exclusive,
that
is,
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
covers
the
situation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
but
it
would
certainly
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney.i
f
a
witness
on
a
stand
denies
having
made
a
statement,
a
previous
statement
which
was
contradictory
to
the
one
that
he
makes
on
the
stand,
and
the
u.s.
attorney
knows
that
that's
not
true,
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
of
the
defense
counsel.
and
the
--
and
the
fact
of
the
prior
inconsistent
statement
is
the
important
thing
and,
once
that's
been
brought
to
the
attention
as
it
would,
i
think,
in
this
case
where
it
was
--
where
the
witness
made
a
statement
on
the
stand
which,
to
the
knowledge
of
the
united
states
attorney
at
that
moment,
was
not
true
whether
because
the
witness
forgot
or
was
lying.
i
think,
then,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney.
and,
i
think
that
the
statute
can
be
appropriately
administered
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
which
congress
intended
and,
also,
to
advance
the
cause
of
criminal
justice
by
appropriate
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
action
by
the
government.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
perhaps,
we
me
--
we
have
a
semantic
difference,
mr.
justice
brenan,
but
i
think
the
statute
is
exclusive,
the
statute
properly
interpreted,
and
i
think
the
statute
is
exclusive.
what
i
was
saying
to
you
before
is
that
the
statute
can
be
supplemented
by
statements
by
the
government,
by
oral
statements
by
the
government,
by
the
calling
of
the
agents,
and
so
forth,
so
that
there
is
no
need
to
find
any
inc
--
any
constitutional
invalidity
in
the
statute
because
the
end
of
--
ends
of
criminal
justice
can
be
attained
by
these
other
methods,
so.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps,
but
i
would
say
again,
mr.
justice
brenan,
that
i
think
those
of
the
peripheral
cases
and
not
the
ordinary
run
of
cases
in
the
criminal
courts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
has
ever
been
interpreted
since
the
--
it
was
adopted
to
preclude
congress
or
the
courts
from
adopting
proper
evidentiary
rules,
including
rules
of
exclusion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
at
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
been
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
been
done
by
the
courts
and
it's
been
done
by
congress
since
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
and
i
think
the
real
issue
is
whether
what
congress
did
here
was
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
power
which
is
inherently
its
under
the
constitution
to
establish
proper
relevant
--
proper
reasonable
rules
of
evidence,
including
exclusionary
rules.
and,
turning
to
that
issue
as
to
whether
this
was
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
congressional
power,
i've
touched
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
certainly
not,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
mere
fact
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
--
there
are
aides
to
determination.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
are
aides
for
the
court
to
make
this
determination.
in
the
first
place,
the
defense
counsel
can
question
the
witness.
“how
long
did
you
talk
to
the
agent?
was
the
entire
discussion
about
this
case
or
was
it
about
some
wholly
extraneous
matters?
did
you
cover
all
what
you've
testified
to
on
direct
examination?”
that
will
be
of
great
help
to
determine
whether
the
agent's
report
is
a
complete
--
summary
or
substantially
verbatim
or
not.
then,
if
the
court
feels
that,
after
having
inspected
the
document
itself
and
having
heard
the
--
or
the
direct
testimony
of
the
witness
and
also
the
cross-examination
as
to
what
went
on
at
the
interview,
if
the
court
then
feels
that
it's
necessary
to
have
a
voir
dire,
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
call
the
agent
to
see
what
the
agent
did
after
having,
i
should
think,
exhausted
what
can
be
done
through
the
witness
himself,
that
is,
asking
the
witness
what
the
agent
did.
“did
he
take
shorthand
notes?
did
he
--
did
he
have
a
recording
machine?
was
there
a
stenographer
there?”
we
certainly
don't
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
--
that
there
is
an
exclusion
on
the
part
of
the
courts
of
the
power
to
hold
a
voir
dire.
we
think
that's
the
unusual
situation,
a
situation
which
will
not
arise
very
frequently
but,
certainly,
it
is
not
excluded.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
basing
it,
in
part,
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and,
that's
true
of
other
types
of
situation
in
which
motion
to
suppress
evidence
and
other
kinds
in
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it's
prior
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
cannot
be
done
before.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice,
congress
adopted
this
view
after
consideration
and
the
problem
with
an
in
camera
inspection
was
the
--
was
considered
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it
--
it
adopted
it
because
he
felt
that
there
was
no
other
solution
possible.
if
you
allow
the
defense
counsel
to
inspect
all
these
documents,
then
you
would
have
frustrated
the
whole
purpose
of
the
legislation,
that
is,
they
would
see
that
which
they're
not
suppose
to
see
if
it
turned
out
that
the
document
was
not
the
kind
they
were
suppose
to
see.
and,
if
the
defense
counsel
made
a
very
large
and
sweeping
demand,
they
would
have
inspection
of
large
and
sweeping
areas
of
documents
which
congress
thought
they
should
not
get
to
see.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
and
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
congress
had
the
right
to
say
that
the
defense
should
not
see
the
kind
of
non-producible
documents
which
were
spelled
out
in
the
statute
as
non-producible.
now,
if
you
had
this
situation
in
which,
if
the
defendant
sees
it
all,
you
have
frustrated
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
you
have
only
two
solutions,
either
to
say
that
it's
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecutor,,
that
he
will
determine
what's
to
be
made
available
or
that
the
judge
will
look
at
it.
and,
if
i
might
read
just
one
sentence
from
an
opinion
of
judge
learned
hand
in
which
he
dealt
with
a
comparable
situation,
he
said
“there
is
no
way
in
which
this
conflict,”
that
is,
the
conflict
between
the
right
of
the
government
to
retain
certain
things
from
the
defendant
and
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
see
other
types
of
producible
documents
where
you
have
a
controversy
as
to
whether
it's
a
producible
document,
there
is
no
way
in
which
this
conflict
can
be
resolved
except
by
making
the
judge's
private
inspection
final,
subject
to
review.
and,
of
course,
you
have
appellate
review
here
that
these
documents
must
be
sealed
and
sent
up
to
the
higher
courts,
including
this
court,
subject
to
review.
and,
while
it
is
true
that
this
deprives
the
party
who
is
denied
inspection
of
any
opportunity
to
dispute
the
judge's
conclusion,
that
is
unavoidable.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
hold
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
what
we
are
now
talking
about.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
if
you
assume,
as
you
--
i
think
you
must
assume,
that
in
--
that
some
of
these
documents
may
not
properly
be
producible
and,
therefore,
are
not
relevant
and
should
not
be
seen
by
the
defense,
then
there
must
be
some
mechanism
for
determining
that
issues
which
does
not
give
the
defense
the
very
thing
which
congress
has
a
right
to
see
--
to
say
that
they
shall
not
see.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
it
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
is
the
--
it
is
what
happens
today
in
relation
to
subpoenas.
if
a
subpoena
is
issued
and
the
government
or
the
party
to
whom
the
subpoena
is
issued
comes
in
and
says
“i
don't
have
these
documents,”
the
defense
counsel
or
the
potential
defendant
doesn't
rummage
through
the
files
of
the
other
side
to
see
whether
there
is
something
there,
the
court
determines
whether
the
return
is
an
accurate
one
as
to
whether
there
is
a
subpoena
document
of
this
kind.
in
civil
cases,
we
have
trade
secrets
which
are
kept
away
from
the
other
side,
at
the
discretion
of
judge,
under
the
rules
adopt
by
this
court.
and
then,
there
is
the
question
of
privileges.
if
a
doctor
is
on
the
stand
and
he
is
asked
to
discuss
something
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
treatment,
he
can
claim
the
privilege
of
the
doctor-patient
relationship
if
--
unless
it's
waived
by
the
patient.
now,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
the
defendant
or
the
other
side
may
say
“i
want
to
hear
everything
that
you
told
him,
doctor,
because
i
think
there
were
certain
things
you
told
that
had
nothing
to
do
his
treatment
whatsoever.
so,
therefore,
i
want
to
hear
everything
you
did
and
told
him
with
relation
to
his
treatment
because
i
want
to
figure
out
for
myself
whether
what
you
did
related
to
his
treatment,”
and
that
relates
to
the
other
types
of
privileges,
too.
and
so,
we
think
that
this
provision
that
congress
adopted
is
not
without
precedent
in
our
law,
going
all
the
way
back
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
whole
basic
postulate
of
this
statute
is
that
certain
things
were
not
to
be
produced
to
the
defendant,
certain
types
of
the
documents
that
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
prosecutor
had
them.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
this
statute
relates
only
to
government
witnesses,
to
--
in
statements
of
government
a
--
witnesses
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution.
this
statute
relates
only
to
things
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
he
is
asked
to
produce
it.
so,
i
--
i
think
that,
ordinarily,
he
would
see
them,
but
the
whole
basis
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
may
not.
possibly
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
this
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
to
see
them.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
and
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
so,
really,
since
the
documents
are
sealed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
the
whole
basis
of
my
argument
is
--
the
whole
basis
of
my
argument
is
that
it
would
frustrate
the
purpose
which
congress
embodied
in
this
statute.
if
you
allow
the
defense
to
see
a
document
before
it
have
been
determined
to
be
the
kind
of
document
which
was
producible
under
the
statute
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
and
every
defendant
would
see
more
than
just
the
particular
document.
he
would
want
to
see
other
files,
to
see
whether
there
weren't
other
like
documents
in
the
case.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
--
i
don't
mean
that.
it
just
so
happen
that
we
didn't
have
it
in
washington.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
we
didn't
have
it
in
washington.
that's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
happened
in
this
case.
the
prosecutor
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
this
document
at
the
time
the
questions
were
asked
in
the
trial
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
--
that's
quite
possible.
if
he
hasn't
already
seen
it,
i
wouldn't
see
any
particular
reason
why
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
then,
it's
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
--
that
of
hick
--
that
doctrine
of
hickman
against
taylor
does
show,
along
with
the
whole
history
of
the
--
of
the
very
limited
discovery
in
criminal
cases
up
to
--
up
to
now,
that
there
has
never
been
unlimited
discovery
in
criminal
cases.
in
fact,
this
court
modified
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
rule
16,
so
as
to
make
very,
very
limited
discovery
in
criminal
cases
in
1944.
there
is
no
doctrine
of
unlimited
discovery
in
criminal
cases
in
our
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but,
the
rule
which
was
originally
broader
in
scope
was
limited
only
to
materials
which
had
been
seized
from
the
defendant,
taken
from
the
defendant
or
from
other
person
by
process.
it
was
limited
specifically
by
this
court
to
that
situation.
if
i
can
spend,
if
i
may,
the
remaining
minutes
on
the
question
of
harmless
error,
because
we
think
that's
an
important
aspect
of
this
case.
i
should
try
to
make
it
clear
to
the
court,
because
i
don't
think
i
have,
that,
after
carlin's
interview
with
the
witness,
there
were
open
--
i
mean,
with
the
agents,
there
were
open-senate
hearings
at
which
carlin
appeared
and
testified,
as
did
many
of
the
other
witnesses
in
this
case.
those
open-senate
hearings
were
available
to
the
defendant
in
these
cases
and
were
used
on
cross-examination
of
carlin
and
of
other
witnesses.
so,
they
were
not
wholly
without
means
of
testing
his
credibility
at
the
trial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
i'm
not
going
to
talk
about
the
contents
of
document.
i'm
going
to
talk
about
the
other
evidence
in
the
case.
i'm
--
what
i'm
going
to
argue
now
as
the
petitioner
rubin
who
was
the
one
petitioner
as
to
whom
there
was
the
most
overwhelming
proof
of
guilt.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
on
this
issue
of
harmless
error
in
this
case,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
i
was
going
to
talk
about
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
well,
i
will
have
to
leave
it
to
the
brief.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
our
general
proposition,
really,
if
i
may
state,
are
two
things.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
one
is
that,
as
to
rubin,
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt
by
many
witnesses,
not
only
--
carlin
was
a
very
secondary
witness
with
relation
to
rubin.
all
of
carlin's
testimony
--
incriminating
testimony
was
corroborated
by
other
witnesses
in
the
case,
either
levi
or
the
bookkeeper
or
other
people,
so
that,
there
was
nothing
that
carlin
said
which
stood
on
carlin's
testimony
alone.
and,
all
--
in
fact,
the
testimony
of
carlin
was,
in
part,
corroborated
by
the
defendant
rubin
himself
and
by
another
defendant,
ades,
who
did
take
the
stand.
now,
that's
the
summary
with
relation
to
rubin.
as
to
wool,
i
would
say
that
carlin
did
not
implicate
him
at
all.
he
did
not
even
come
into
the
conspiracy
admittedly
until
a
period
after
carlin
had
left
the
office
of
the
bonita
company.
and,
the
only
last
thing
i
would
like
to
say
as
to
the
argument
that
the
counsel
were
deterred
from
asking
for
statements
from
other
witnesses
by
the
ruling
of
judge
kaufman,
two
things,
if
i
might.
judge
kaufman
said
that,
under
a
very
slight
suggestion
of
inconsistency,
under
the
then-prevailing
second
circuit
rule,
he
would
order
the
production
of
the
document.
they
never
made
an
effort
to
show
with
respect
to
any
other
witnesses,
except
one,
as
to
whether
there
were
prior
inconsistent
statements.
as
to
porreca,
one
of
the
prosecution
witnesses,
they
got
him
to
admit
that
he
had
made
a
prior
inconsistent
statement
and
they
did
not
ask
for
the
statement,
so
that
even
clearly
on
the
second
circuit
rule
and
under
judge
kaufman's
ruling,
that
would
have
been
producible,
but
they
did
not
ask
for
a
correct
statement.
and,
so,
we
think
that
there
is
really
no
basis
for
saying
that
judge
kaufman's
ruling
as
to
carlin
permeated
the
trial
in
the
sense
that
it
deterred
the
petitioner's
counsel
from
asking
for
statements
with
respect
to
other
words.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
