mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
may
it
please
the
court.
on
occasions
in
the
past
when
i
have
had
the
great
privilege
of
appearing
before
this
court,
i
have
had
the
temerity
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
i'm
somewhat
hard
of
hearing.
and,
in
the
past,
the
court
has
treated
me
most
courteously
and
kindly.
and
i
note
since
my
last
appearance
here
that
some
additions
have
been
made
which
i'm
quite
sure
will
do
away
with
the
difficulty.
i'd
like
the
court,
however,
to
keep
that
in
mind
in
the
event
that
i
do
not
appear
to
understand
any
question
which
you
may
put
to
me.
your
honors,
these
cases
come
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
it
might
not.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
by
no
means,
do
i
--
i
welcome
it
very
much.
these
cases
come
to
this
court,
may
it
please
the
court,
upon
writs
of
certiorari
which
were
issued
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
as
a
review
of
judgments
of
that
court.
there
are
three
petitioners
here
now
on
three
separate
grants
of
certiorari.
those
petitioners
are,
respectively,
following
the
numbers
assigned
by
the
clerk,
mr.
lev,
who
is
represented
by
me,
petitioner
rubin
who
is
represented
by
mr.
sullivan
of
the
new
york
bar,
and
petitioner
wool
who
is
represented
by
mr.
albert
treiman
of
the
new
york
bar.
the
court
has
seen
fit
to
consolidate
these
three
particular
cases
for
argument
and
has
granted
us
an
hour
and
a
half.
i
would
propose,
with
the
court's
permission,
to
argue
for
35
minutes,
and
mr.
treiman
will
argue
for
20,
and
mr.
sullivan
will
conclude
with
the
final
35.
originally,
this
case
developed
in
new
york
on
the
basis
of
an
indictment
which
was
returned
in
the
second
circuit
charging
the
petitioners
here
and
filed
by
the
defendants
in
that
case
with
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government
of
its
governmental
functions
in
the
administration
and
procurement
of
the
quartermaster
corps.
that
indictment
followed
a
very
full
and
extensive
hearing
before
one
of
the
senate
committees,
approximately
a
year
or
two
before
the
indictment
had
been
returned.
as
part
of
the
indictment,
as
part
of
the
conspiracy,
it
was
charged
that
petitioner
lev
and
petitioner
rubin
had
one
ades,
who
was
another
defendant
in
the
case
but
who
was
not
here
on
certiorari,
would
offer
and
give
money
and
other
things
of
value
to
various
persons
connected
with
the
quartermaster
corps
office
in
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
them
to
disclose
confidential
information
prior
to
the
awarding
of
any
contract
by
the
quartermaster
corps
to
corruptly
grant
deviations
in
pay
in
connection
with
such
contracts
when
they
were
granted
and,
finally,
to
influence
their
matters
--
their
decisions
on
matters
pending
before
them.
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
when
the
government
undertook
to
prove
its
case,
they
opted,
first,
a
witness
who
is
an
expert
and
who
testified
purely
on
technical
matters
involving
procurement
for
the
quartermaster
corps.
the
next
witness
for
the
government
was
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
carlin,
and
he
figures
such
reliefs
throughout
our
entire
discussion
here.
carlin,
according
to
his
testimony
and,
here,
his
testimony
was
offered
to
prove
those
things
that
i
have
just
mentioned.
he
was
a
certified
public
accountant.
he
testified
that
sometime
during
the
course
of
the
year
1952,
he
was
present
in
the
office
of
a
mr.
ades,
who
was
a
defendant,
as
i've
already
said
to
the
court,
and
a
mr.
levy,
not
to
be
confused
with
the
petitioner
lev.
those
gentlemen
were
conducting
a
business
in
new
york
and
according
to
what
carlin
testified
to,
rubin
appeared
and
told
them
that
he
was
very
influential
in
the
quartermaster
corps
in
new
york,
sometimes
referred
to
during
the
course
of
this
argument
and
of
the
brief
says
“16th
street”
that
he
knew
intimately
the
personnel
over
there,
that
due
to
his
intimate
connections
with
that
personnel,
he
would
be
able
to
get
levy
and
ades'
contracts.
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
the
carlin
testimony
that
i
am
now
developing
for
the
court.
according
to
carlin,
rubin
also
said,
on
this
particular
occasion,
that
5%
of
every
contract,
the
price
of
every
contract,
ought
to
be
given
to
him
so
that
he,
in
turn,
might
turn
it
back
to
the
people
in
the
quartermaster
corps
at
16th
street
who
had
been
doing
him
favors.
he
also
said
that,
due
to
his
acquaintanceship
with
these
people
and
the
fact
that
he
would
be
turning
over
such
money
to
them,
that
he
could
get
deviations
from
contracts,
speaking
generally,
that
he
had
some
power
of
control
over
the
choice
of
the
inspectors
who
ultimately,
in
the
event
a
contract
was
awarded,
would
inspect
the
work
under
that
contract.
at
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony,
mr.
sullivan,
who
will
appear
here
before
you
on
cross-examination,
was
able
to
develop
from
mr.
carlin
that
he
had
given
a
prior
statement
to
two
senate
investigators
named
belavan
and
pool.
mr.
sullivan
also
developed
that
that
--
those
statements
related
to
the
matters
concerning
which
carlin
had
testified
in
this
trial.
he
also
stated,
in
response
to
a
direct
question,
that
he
believed
that
he
had
signed
such
a
statement.
now,
the
trial
judge,
upon
demand
being
made
by
counsel
for
rubin
to
produce
that
statement,
refused
to
order
the
government
to
do
so
on
the
grounds
that
the
proper
foundation
of
inconsistency
had
not
been
shown.
and,
with
that,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
insofar
as
the
trial
was
concerned.
this
trial,
your
honors,
was
decided
ultimately
in
april,
i
believe,
of
1957
and
resulted
in
a
finding
of
guilty
as
to
virtually
all
of
the
defendants
involved,
including
the
petitioner
represented
by
me,
who
is
subsequently
sentenced
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
and,
also,
to
pay
a
fine.
two
months
after
this
decision
in
the
trial
court,
this
court
handed
down
its
now
famous
decision
in
jencks
versus
the
united
states.
accordingly,
counsel
for
mr.
lev
on
appeal,
as
well
as
counsel
for
the
other
petitioners,
raised
the
question
under
the
jencks
case
as
to
whether
or
not,
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
they
were
not
entitled
to
see
the
carlin
statement
and
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
so
grant
them
permission
amounted
to
prejudicial
error.
the
government,
almost
a
year
later
and,
apparently,
for
some
reason
or
other,
it
took
that
long
for
the
briefs
to
be
written
and,
of
course,
to
get
it
into
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government,
almost
a
year
later,
in
april
of
1958,
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals,
not
the
district
court,
but
with
the
court
of
appeals,
a
sealed
envelope
which
purported
to
contain
a
memorandum
given
by
carlin
to
a
senate
investigator
or
to
these
two
senate
investigators.
no
one
on
petitioner's
side
has
ever
seen
that
memorandum.
i
understand,
from
the
government,
that
the
sealed
envelop
is
in
the
possession
of
the
clerk
of
this
court
and
available
to
your
honors
for
examination.
at
the
same
time
that
they
filed
the
sealed
envelope
containing
this
memorandum,
the
district
attorney
filed
an
affidavit
in
support
of
the
sealed
envelope
when
they
use
that
expression,
which
he
said
that
this
was
what
he
had
received
from
the
senate
committee
here
in
washington
and
that
he
had
been
informed
by
the
acting-general
counsel
of
that
committee
that
it
was
the
only
record
that
they
had
of
any
interrogation
of
carlin.
they
also
filed
a
--
an
affidavit
of
mr.
belavan
who,
as
you
will
recall,
was
one
of
the
investigators
who
took
the
statement
from
mr.
carlin,
according
to
mr.
carlin.
this
affidavit
of
carlin
was
dated
some
three
years
after
the
events
which
it
purported
to
describe.
in
it,
he
said
that
in
1955,
he
and
pool
had
called
upon
carlin
in
new
york
during
the
month
of
march
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you,
your
honor.
shortly
before
the
court
recessed,
i
had
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
state
of
the
record,
one
of
the
first
that
went
up
on
appeal,
was
that
there
had
been
a
prior
statement
given
by
the
witness
carlin,
concerning
the
events
to
which
he
had
testified
upon
the
trial,
and
i
submit,
of
course,
at
this
point
that
on
that
state
of
the
record,
at
that
particular
time
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
jencks
case
followed
shortly
thereafter,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
a
reversal
would
have
been
required,
probably
with
a
remand.
undoubtedly,
the
government
was
aware
of
that
particular
circumstance
because,
as
i
also
said
a
short
time
ago,
about
a
year
later,
they
filed
this
memorandum
to
which
i
have
made
reference
and
a
--
an
affidavit
in
support
of
the
memorandum.
that
memorandum,
among
other
things,
established
--
it
believed
the
following,
that
belavan
and
pool,
the
senate
investigators,
had
had
an
interview
with
carlin
in
march
of
1955,
some
three
years
prior.
that,
according
to
belavan,
this
was
the
only
interview
that
he
quote
“recalls”.
he
then
stated
that,
on
information
and
belief,
he
did
not
believe
that
mr.
pool
had
--
had
any
other
interview
with
carlin
but
that
he
did
not
know
pool's
whereabouts
at
this
particular
time.
of
course,
3500,
title
18
u.s.c.
3500
had
come
down
prior
--
and
had
been
passed
by
congress
prior
to
the
time
that
this
particular
affidavit
was
filed.
so,
mr.
belavan,
in
preparing
his
affidavit,
then,
said
in
the
words
of
the
statute
that
he
had
summarized
generally
what
carlin
had
told
him
during
the
course
of
this
interview,
that
this
was
not
signed
or
adopted
by
mr.
carlin
but
that
he
had
prepared
it
purely
for
chief
counsel
kennedy
of
the
committee,
before
whom
carlin
was
subsequently,
some
six
months
after
the
signing
of
the
statement
or
the
giving
of
the
statement,
before
which
committee
he
testified.
he
then
said,
also
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
according
to
his
affidavit,
that
the
memoranda
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.
so,
i
say
this
are
the
words
of
the
statute
adopted
in
the
affidavit
and,
undoubtedly,
with
an
eye
on
the
statute.
of
course,
i
point
out
to
the
court
immediately
that
these
are
merely
conclusions
of
the
witness
or
the
affiant
in
this
particular
case
as
to
what
the
memoranda
showed.
now,
when
the
government
filed
that
particular
memoranda
supported
by
this
affidavit,
a
number
of
questions
of
fact,
as
we
view
it,
arose
in
the
court
of
appeals,
one,
there
was
certainly
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
signed
statement.
and,
according
to
carlin,
there
was.
two,
even
if
there
had
not
been
a
signed
statement
had
there
been
a
statement
which
had
been
adopted
or
accepted
in
any
fashion
by
mr
carlin.
and,
thirdly,
was
it
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
what
--
of
an
oral
statement
of
the
witness.
the
court
of
appeals,
this
we
are
most
critical,
decided,
one,
that
there
was
no
other
statement
and
it
did
that
purely
by
reference
to
the
ex
parte
affidavit
of
belavan
without
any
cross-examination
or
inquiry
being
permitted
into
the
matter
whatsoever,
by
petitioner
or
any
of
the
other
defendants.
it
also
decided
that
the
statement
had
never
been
adopted
in
any
fashion
by
mr.
carlin
and,
i
submit
most
respectfully
to
this
court
that
the
only
way
that
the
court
below
could
have
reached
that
conclusion
would
be
by
a
full
and
complete
100%
reliance
upon
what
mr.
belavan
said
in
his
ex
parte
affidavit,
again,
without
having
it
tested
by
cross-examination
of
anyone.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
third
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
his
--
his
testimony
--
his
testimony
only
was
that
he
believed
he
had
signed
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that
was
all.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and,
judge
kaufman,
the
trial
judge
at
the
particular
time
for
the
very
fast
finish
to
the
question,
he
said
that
there
was
nothing
there
that
would
require
him
to
--
to
look
into
the
nature
of
the
document
and
the
trial
and
procedure
from
there
on.
and,
no
other
request,
i
might
add,
that,
because
of
that,
ruling
were
made
for
the
statements
of
any
other
witness
who
testified
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
a
matter
which
would
be
eluded
to
by
counsel
who'll
follow
me.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
excuse
me?
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although,
i
still
believe
that
judge
kaufman
was
wrong
in
requiring
a
foundation
of
inconsistency
to
be
laid
prior
to
the
introduction
of
or
the
production
of
the
document.
that
seemed
to
be
the
rule
in
virtually
every
other
circuit,
except
the
second
circuit,
at
that
particular
time.
now,
the
third
question
which
was
before
the
court
was
whether
or
not
this
was
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
the
oral
statement
given
by
carlin.
and,
the
court
decided
that,
since
mr.
belavan
had
so
characterized
it,
it
was.
but,
it
went
on
in
this
particular
instance
to
say
that
it
had
examined
the
internal
evidence,
which
i
put
in
quotes,
“itself
and
that
internal
evidence
tended
to
bare
out
the
statement
of
mr.
belavan
that
it
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.”
now,
we
submit
again,
i
say
to
the
court,
most
respectfully,
that
with
these
three
questions
of
fact
at
large
that
it
was
most
improper
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
this
case
purely
on
the
ex
parte
affidavits
of
mr.
belavan.
and,
it
did
decide
it
in
this
fashion,
against
petitioners.
it
stated
that,
while
it
was
true
that
under
jencks
it
was
error
for
the
trial
court
to
deny
the
petitioners
the
carlin
statement.
nevertheless,
congress
had
seen
fit
to
pass,
18
u.s.c.
3500,
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
jencks
act,
and
that
had
a
very
narrow
definition
as
to
what
statements
were,
that
a
summa
--
a
general
summary
of
what
a
witness
had
told
a
government
agent
was
obviously
not
within
the
--
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
and,
therefore,
in
the
event
of
a
new
trial,
it
would
not
be
open
to
the
petitioners
and,
therefore,
he
affirmed
the
conviction.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
now
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
sir.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
he
did
not.
and,
if
i
may
touch
on
that
for
a
moment,
since
you
have
raised
it,
sir,
the
--
my
client,
mr.
lev's
counsel
at
the
time,
was
the
gentleman
who
opened
up
the
cross-examination
as
to
carlin.
he
was
the
very
first.
he
was
able
to
illicit
from
carlin,
and
you
keep
in
mind
that
this
was
at
the
very
outset
of
the
trial
in
which
a
large
conspiracy
had
been
charged.
he
was
able
to
illicit
from
carlin
that
lev
was
not
at
this
particular
meeting
that
he
reported,
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
about
lev
at
that
particular
time.
i
think
that,
had
petitioner's
counsel
at
that
particular
moment
urged
the
production
of
the
document,
that
he
would
have
had
no
standing
whatsoever.
but,
subsequently,
he
was
tied
up
by
other
evidence
to
rubin
who
is
largely
implicated
by
this
statement
and,
under
the
court's
instructions,
the
familiar,
usual,
basic
instructions
are
always
given
in
conspiracy
cases,
he
was
tied
to
rubin.
and,
rubin
was
largely,
very,
very
largely
implicated
in
the
statement
of
carlin.
but,
i
say
there
was
no
point
at
that
time
in
petitioner's
then-counsel
to
make
the
objection.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
there
was
no
other
objection
after
that.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
sir.
everyone
seemed
to
be
content
to
take
judge
kaufman's
ruling
at
the
time.
and,
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
examine
the
trial
record
here,
you
will
understand
why,
because
the
judge
is
very
short
with
counsel
and
had
been
short
with
them
all
the
way
during
the
trial
and,
although
i
was
not
in
the
trial,
i've
examined
the
record
and
it
appears
to
me
that
counsel
was
somewhat
intimidated,
particularly,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
had
already
announced
what
his
ruling
would
be
on
this
type
of
thing.
no
one
again
ever
made
any
such
objection
and,
of
course,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
jencks
had
not
come
down
and
there
was
some
authority
at
the
particular
time
with
some
courts,
not
the
majority
view
but
the
minority
view,
that
a
foundation
of
inconsistency
had
to
be
laid
before
there
could
be
any
production
even
to
the
court
in
the
very
first
instance.
in
any
event,
the
record
makes
clear
that
no
one
again
made
any
objection.
as
i
said
before,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
--
we
regard
this
error
as
a
most
serious
error
and
we
think,
apart
form
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
substantially
verbatim
recital,
that
the
denial
of
the
cross-examination
alone
to
show
whether
or
not
there
was
not
another
written
statement
or
that
this
statement
had
not
been
adopted
or
signed
was
most
serious.
i
point
out
again
to
your
honors
that,
in
adopting
or
signing
a
statement,
it
is
not
necessary,
really,
that
a
person
sign
it.
he
might
conceivably
be
in
a
room
when
his
statement
is
read
to
him
and,
if
he
remained
silent
under
such
circumstances,
as
a
reasonable
man
would
speak
out,
that
might,
in
itself,
be
an
acknowledgement.
nobody
was
given
the
right,
whatsoever,
to
cross-examine
belavan
as
to
whether
or
not
the
events
which
had
occurred
three
years
before
were,
in
fact,
true.
and,
i
also
point
to
the
language
of
the
court
in
which
it
finds
that
this
was
a
substantially
--
it
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.
there
is
no
positive
language
there
whatsoever.
the
court
seem
to,
and
that
is
the
court
below,
seem
to
equivocate
when
it
said
that
this
internal
evidence
tends
to
bear
this
out,
that
this
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
statement.
i
think,
had
we
been
given
the
right
to
cross-examine,
we
might
well
have
established
that
this
was
a
statement
which
would
have
been
producible
under
the
jencks
statute,
as
well
as
under
the
jencks
act
itself.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
the
question
of
fact
arose
this
was
way,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
carlin
had
testified
that
he
had
signed
the
statement.
belavan
said
that
there
was
no
signed
statement.
that
was
one
question.
the
second
one
was,
even
if
they
had
not
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
excuse
me?
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes.
that
would
show
right
on
its
face.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that
would
show
on
its
face,
whether
it
was
signed
or
not
but,
then,
i
point
out
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
it
might
have
been
adopted.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
sir.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
not
signed,
of
course,
and
secondly,
it
examined
the
statement
itself
to
find
out
the
nature
of
the
statement.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
it
is.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
it
might
be
adopted
or
approved
by
the
witness,
if
not
signed.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
excuse
me?
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
we
say,
we
don't
know.
that's
really
the
basis
of
our
complaint,
that
we
had
no
way
of
knowing,
that
this
well
might
have
been
adopted
or
approved
by
the
witness
carlin.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right,
and
without
cross-examination
of
valid
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
actually
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
what
we're
contending
for
would
be
a
voi
dire
examination.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and,
we
say
that
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right.
there
would
be
no
acknowledgment.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
actually
right.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
correct.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
say,
it
might
well
have
been
established
at
the
trial.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right.
it
was
never
there.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
correct.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
i
would
concede
that,
except
that
the
opposite
result
might
well
have
resulted
had
there
been
a
cross-examination
of
belavan
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
he
took
the
statement
and
how
he
tendered
it
to
chief
counsel
kennedy
and
what
purpose
chief
counsel
kennedy
wanted
to
use
it
for.
it
seem
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
sir.
i
did
document
for
it,
i
presume.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
and
it
is
to
the
third
view
that
i
lean.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and
i
--
we
urged
that
some
other
place
in
our
brief.
now,
of
course,
i
don't
want
your
honors
to
think
that
we
have
abandoned
the
argument
that
they
may
have
in
fact
been
another
written
statement
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
witness
had
said
he
believed
he
signed
one,
and
that
the
government
had
produced
only,
what
they
called,
a
general
summary.
and,
that
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
decided
that
this
was
the
only
one
and
they
did
that,
as
i
said,
purely
on
the
faces
of
the
belavan
affidavit.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
it
had
been
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
it
had
been
laid.
the
record
of
the
trial
court,
the
printed
record
here
shows
that
mr.
carlin
testified
that
he
had
given
the
statement
and
he
believed
he
signed
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
in
view
of
the
witness'
testimony
that
he
believed
he
signed
one.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
say
it's
within
the
logical
possibilities
that
there
were
two
statements.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
they
--
there
were
no
counter
affidavits
filed.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
the
affidavits
were
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no.
the
affidavits
were
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
brief
for
petitioner
was
there.
no
counter
affidavits
were
ever
filed.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
and,
there
was
no
way
the
counsel
could
know,
really,
without
cross-examining.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
i
think
we
were
already
at
that
point
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
may
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right.
carlin
was
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
a
government
witness.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
in
no
fashion
whatsoever.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
say
that
that
is
a
logical
possibility
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
mr.
justice
brennan
points
out
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
i
--
i
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
that
would
have
been
repetitive.
the
state
of
the
record
on
carlin's
statement
had
already
put
the
petitioners,
the
defendants
in
that
position.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
i
think,
under
the
circumstances
which
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
it
could
be.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
but,
it
--
incidentally,
the
carlin
testimony
was
never
subjected
to
cross-examination
by
the
government
when
they
--
or,
rather,
to
direct
--
redirect
when
they
took
them
back
and
stood.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
probably
didn't
care
there.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
i
assume
that
they
might
have
done
that,
in
any
event,
i
must
concede
that,
on
the
record,
there's
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
such
thing
is
charged.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
i
never
had,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no
defendant
has
ever
seen
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
the
affidavit
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
the
affidavits
were
made
available
to
the
appellants
on
appeal.
they
became
part
of
the
record.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
they
were.
i
--
i
wasn't
in
the
case
at
that
particular
time.
i've
examined
the
briefs
and
there
was
argument
on
that
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
--and
the
statements
of
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes.
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
theory
--
the
theory
of
the
--
the
appellants
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
was
to
attack
the
--
the
holding
of
the
court
insofar
as
it
held
that
this
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.
now,
we
come
to
that
--
that
--
we
come
to
the
question
now
as
to
whether
or
not
--
whether
this
was
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
or
not,
was
it
not
admissible
under
18
u.s.c.
3500
and,
if
it
was
not
admissible
under
18
--
under
that
particular
statute,
was
it
not
admissible
under
jencks?
we
have
held
--
we
have
argued
here
in
our
briefs
that,
and
we
support
it
by
reference
to
the
expressed
language
of
the
statute
into
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
statute,
that
the
procedure
for
producing
documents,
as
outlined
in
the
jencks
statute,
is
not
exclusive
at
all.
particularly,
it
appears
from
the
senate
debates
led
by
senator
o'malley
where
they
made
very
clear
that
they
had
in
mind
that
if
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
or
any
rule
of
court
permitted
the
introduction
of
such
statements
or
summaries,
then
they
would
be
admitted
pursuant
to
that
rule
or
--
of
court
or
to
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
and,
i
point
out
to
the
court,
and
we
argue
it
extensively
in
our
brief,
that
if
the
procedure,
as
outlined
by
the
jencks
statute,
is
not
exclusive,
then
under
this
court
decision
in
jencks,
it's
clearly
admissible
whether
it's
a
summary
or
whether
it's
hearsay,
no
matter
what
it
is,
if
it
reflects
upon
the
events
related
by
the
witness
at
the
trial.
i
think,
when
this
court
announced
two
rules
of
relevancy
in
jencks,
it
was
making
that
most
clear.
as
your
honors
will
recall,
you
said
that
there
is
a
rule
of
relevancy
which
governs
production
and
then,
subsequently,
after
the
particular
document
is
produced
for
the
examination
of
the
defense,
then,
the
court
will
rule
upon
relevancy
form
the
standpoint
of
evidence.
quite
obviously,
your
honors
would
not
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
making
that
distinction
if
you
had
not
had
in
mind,
in
the
very
first
instance,
that
a
non-admissible
statement
or
report
of
a
government
witness
to
a
government
agent
might
be
admissible
or
might
be
producible
in
the
very
first
instance
without
ever
being
admitted
into
evidence.
otherwise,
there'll
be
no
reason
for
you
to
make
the
distinction,
as
i
just
pointed
out.
so
that,
i
say
that,
under
jencks,
and
we
argue
this,
as
i
say,
extensively
that,
under
jencks,
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
production,
any
summary
by
a
government
agent
of
what
a
witness
told
him
is
admissible
or
producible
to
the
defendant
in
the
first
instance
for
such
use,
as
this
court
said,
“on
cross-examinations
may
further
his
defense.”
the
government's
contention
as
of
the
statute
and
jencks,
both
are
based
upon
the
same
rationale
that
the
only
thing
that
is
producible
is
a
matter
which
might
ultimately
be
admitted
for
impeaching
purposes
in
evidence.
and,
we
say
that,
in
the
face
of
the
language
of
this
court,
that
that
cannot
be.
if
so,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
jenks,
the
rule
would
be
much
the
same
as
it
was
prior
to
jencks,
and
there'd
be
no
reason
for
18
u.s.c.
3500.
now,
we
contend
that
a
summary
of
what
a
witness
told
a
government
agent
may
be
most
useful
to
establish
all
of
the
things
that
this
court
laid
down
as
test
of
inconsistency.
not
only
flat
contradiction,
as
you
will
recall,
but
omissions,
order
of
statement,
difference
in
contrast,
and
so
on.
nobody
on
the
petitioner's
side
proposes
that
such
a
document
could
ever
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes
and,
following
the
rule
of
this
court,
there
is
no
question
that
once
a
witness
had
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that
once
a
witness
had
made
a
statement
and
had
been
cross-examined
on
it,
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
offer
a
hearsay
statement
of
an
agent
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
or
the
inconsistency
of
what
the
witness
said,
but
the
impeachment
would
follow
through
the
mouth,
presumably,
of
the
government
agent
who
took
the
statement.
and,
there
would
be
none
of
the
hassles
and
harassments
referred
to
here
in
the
government's
brief
under
such
circumstance.
thank
you
very
much.
we
submit
that
this
matter
should
be
remanded.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would,
first,
like
to
reply
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
put
to
my
brother
davis
here.
in
order
to
make
the
record,
i
went
to
the
clerk's
office
this
morning
and
inquired
for
the
sealed
envelope
and
asked
to
examine
its
contents.
i
was
not
shown
the
--
the
envelope.
we
do
not
yet
know
what
was
in
it.
yesterday,
during
the
course
of
the
government's
argument
and
also
during
my
own,
my
antenna,
more
or
less,
picked
up
a
message
from
a
segment
of
the
court
that,
conceivably,
here,
there
may
be
some
error
but
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
petitioner
lev
because
he
had
filed
no
objection
in
the
first
place
and
his
then-attorney
had
not
developed
the
demand
for
production
as
made
by
mr.
sullivan.
and,
if
such
a
view
exists,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
rubin
--
rather,
the
carlin
testimony
became
very
admissible
against
mr.
lev.
therefore,
any
impeachment
of
it
would
have
been
of
great
help
to
mr.
lev
in
possibly
obtaining
an
acquittal.
the
reason
that
it
was
admitted,
the
reason
that
the
evidence
was
admissible
against
lev,
was
because,
although
there
may
have
been
two
conspiracies
described
by
the
government
as
the
bonita
conspiracy
and
the
white
hat
conspiracy
and
that
lev
was
involved
only
in
the
white
hat
conspiracy
and
was
insulated
from
the
bonita
conspiracy
by
the
obstructions
of
the
court
that,
therefore,
the
carlin
testimony
was
not
admissible
against
him.
i
would
point
out,
if
that
thought
is
in
the
minds
of
any
member
of
the
court,
that
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
were,
and
they
were
so
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
there
was
one
continuous
conspiracy
as
to
all
defendants
expect
lev,
and
he
thereupon
instructed
that
the
acts
of
declarations
and
omissions
of
any
conspirator
during
the
life
of
that
conspiracy
were
admissible
against
any
other
person
who,
at
anytime,
entered
into
the
conspiracy.
so,
there
can
be
no
question
in
my
mind
but
one,
lev
was
seriously
harmed
by
the
error,
if
any.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
you
understood
me
correctly.
the
charge,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was,
in
reality,
a
monstrosity.
it
was
impossible
to
understand.
it
went
through
96
pages
of
the
typewritten
record.
it
--
in
some
places,
it
referred
to
two
conspiracies
then,
in
other
places,
to
one
conspiracy.
we
raised
the
question
of
variance
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and,
unfortunately,
from
our
standpoint,
the
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
those
questions.
but,
finally,
the
jury
came
back,
after
having
been
out
some-24
or
36
hours,
and
asked
whether
or
not
one
conspiracy
was
related
to
the
other,
and
the
judge
gave
an
entirely
inclusive
instruction
on
it
that
i,
as
a
lawyer,
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
to
understand.
i
don't
understand
it,
i
will
say
to
the
court
quite
frankly.
but,
in
any
event,
from
it,
it
became
clearer
and,
from
eight
or
nine
other
instructions,
it
became
clear
that
lev
could
be
chargeable
in
the
white
hat
conspiracy
with
the
acts
of
rubin
who
was
his
co-conspirator
concededly
in
the
white
hat
conspiracy,
even
if
lev
was
not
in
the
bonita
conspiracy,
and
the
carlin
testimony
related
directly
to
rubin.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
therefore
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
sir.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
there
was
no
restriction
of
carlin's
testimony
as
such.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
as
such.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
in
this
sense,
that
the
court
told
the
jury
that
lev
was
not
involved
in
the
bonita
conspiracy
and
was
involved
only
in
the
white
hat
conspiracy.
but,
as
i've
just
pointed
out,
so
was
rubin
involved
in
the
white
hat
conspiracy
and,
if
the
carlin
testimony
was
admissible
against
rubin,
as
it
concededly
was,
then
lev
was
stuck
with
it
under
the
familiar
rules
governing
the
acts
and
declarations
of
conspirators.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
and
the
trial
court
attempted
to
do
that,
but
the
court
of
appeals
admitted
that
the
error
was
in
there.
they
called
it
error,
but
they
called
it
harmless
error.
in
my
opinion,
i
think
it
was
a
most
prejudicial
type
of
error
to
permit
the
jury
to
consider,
as
it
must
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
paoli
case,
this
great
mass
of
evidence
relative
to
bribery
and
corruption
in
the
bonita
conspiracy
against
lev.
i
think
a
very
unjust
result
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
came
to
mind.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
oh,
only
because
the
question
has
been
raised
here
as
to
whether
or
not
this
error
has
any
application
to
lev
in
any
instance.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
the
government
--
the
government,
i
thought
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
it
just
said,
in
this
fashion,
that
he
was
only
in
the
white
hat
conspiracy,
but
that
all
acts
and
declarations
of
other
conspirators
were
not
to
be
used
against
him.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
oh,
i'm
not
arguing
that
and
i
certainly,
your
honor,
do
not
want
to
be
understood
as
trying
to
inject
it
here.
it's
only
here
and
against
the
--
i
only
argue
it
to
show
that
the
carlin
--
the
error
as
to
rubin
goes
over
as
to
lev.
i
don't
have
a
great
deal
of
time
left
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself,
very
briefly,
to
this
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
is
exclusive
or
not.
the
government,
yesterday,
expressed
some
surprise
that
we
would
even
argue
it
and
i
am
surprised
that
the
government's
surprised
since
it's
point
one
in
our
opening
brief
here.
and,
we
again
deal
with
it
in
a
reply
brief.
the
government
says,
as
i
follow
mr.
davis'
argument,
that
senate
report
891
describes
the
procedure
to
be
exclusive,
and
that's
quite
true,
i've
examined
the
report,
but
that
report
was
handed
into
the
senate
or
handed
up
by
the
subcommittee
of
the
senate
long
before
there
were
any
amendments
to
the
suggested
legislation.
and,
when
you
examine
the
amendments,
it
becomes
very
clear
and
very
obvious
that
congress
was
saying
and
the
senate
in
its
debates
was
saying
that
it
was
not
to
be
exclusive.
i
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
when
the
department
of
justice
sent
up
the
bill,
it
intended
it
to
be
exclusive.
but,
senator
o'maley
and
some
of
his
colleagues
were
able
to
detect
that
particular
record
by
the
department
of
justice,
and
there
was
an
exchange
of
letters
between
the
then-acting
attorney
general
and
senator
o'maley.
and,
senator
o'maley
then
exposed,
if
i
may
use
the
expression,
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
justice
to
do
away
with
the
rules
of
pre
--
federal
criminal
procedure
of
that
particular
point.
and,
there
is
a
discussion
in
--
by
professor
keith
in
the
catholic
university
law
review,
which
i
refer
to
in
my
brief,
which
goes
into
that
extensively.
in
any
event,
once
the
senate
was
able
to
detect
what
the
department
of
justice
was
up
to
at
that
particular
time,
it
really
amendment
that
first
section
and
it
knocked
out
the
provision
which,
as
i
recall,
was
somewhat
this
language
that
there
should
--
that
the
statute
governed
no
claim
--
no
rule
of
court
or
of
criminal
procedure
to
the
contrary,
notwithstanding,
and
that
went
out
very
fast
for
the
senate
understands
it.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
no,
i
would
say
that,
under
rule
17
(c),
under
the
prior
case,
i
believe,
you
are
entitled
to
documents
such
as
we're
discussing
here.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
precisely.
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
precisely,
and
i
agree
with
your
honor,
which
show
then
that
they
did
not
intend
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
if
they
had
the
application,
and
they
so
wrote
it
in
their
subsequent
amendment
to
put
in
the
word
“if,”
and
then,
when
the
bill
came
out
of
conference,
the
house
had
bought
completely
the
department
of
justice
version.
when
it
came
out
of
conference,
they
moved
it
back
then
to
the
senate
version
and
struck
all
reference
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
or
to
the
procedure
as
outlined
in
the
subsequent
paragraph
(b).
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
well,
i
respectfully
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
that
--
i
would
like
to
respond
but
i
better
pass
onto
something
else,
if
i'm
going
to
finish
my
argument.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
was
decided
in
the
case
itself,
and
i
dragged
out
the
record
in
here
this
morning
and
it
is
very
brief.
and,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
examination
of
the
witness
ford
whose
testimony,
of
course,
was
considered
in
jenks,
and
this
is
precisely
the
testimony
to
which
this
court
referred.
ford
was
asked
“after
you
made
your
contact
with
the
fbi,
did
you
give
them
information
concerning
activities
going
on
before
you
made
contact
with
the
fbi?”
answer,
“yes,
because
that
is
what
led
me
to
the
fbi.”
“and
did
you
make
those
reports
in
writing?”
answer,
“some
of
them
in
writing
and
some
of
them
oral.”
question,
“when
you
gave
oral
reports,
were
they
taken
down
by
someone?”
“i
think
some
notes
were
taken.i
think
some
notes
were
taken.”
question,
“and
after
you
gave
the
oral
reports
and
the
notes
were
taken,
was
something
typed
up
for
you
to
sign?”
“no.”
“do
you
recall
giving
a
written
report
to
the
fbi
concerning
the
foundling
convention
of
the
progressive
party
in
july
of
1948?”
question,
“but
your
recollection
is
that
you
did
not
give
such
a
report?”
answer,
“my
recollection
is
that
i
told
the
fbi
exactly
what
went
on
at
the
convention
and
some
other
events
preceding
that.”
“and
was
that
written
down?”
“did
i
write
it?”
“first,
did
you
write
it
then?”
“i
don't
recall.”
“you
don't
recall?”
“i
don't
recall
that
i
wrote
it
down
specifically,
but
i
am
pretty
sure
that
i
didn't.”
“did
someone
write
it
down
as
you
told
it
to
them?
as
you
told
it
to
them?”
“i
think
some
notes
were
taken.”
“isn't
it
a
fact
that
you
dictated
something
in
the
presence
of
a
stenographer
on
that
convention?”
“weren't
you
asked
questions
and
didn't
you
give
answers
which
were
taken
down
by
a
stenographer?”
“your
recollection
about
that
is
precise,
is
it?
you
are
sure
that
you
did
--
that
you
did
not
either
dictate
a
statement
or
answer
questions
which
were
taken
down
by
a
shorthand
reporter?”
answer,
“i
am
positive.”
now,
i
submit,
again,
respectfully
to
the
court
that
this
court
decided
in
jenks
that
notes,
just
notes
of
what
a
witness
said
which,
quite
obviously,
might
not
be
a
substantially
verbatim
statement
as
to
what
he
said,
was
admissible.
i
say
that,
in
my
opinion,
the
court
was
holding
that
inadmissible
documents
are
producible
if
relevant
under
the
definition
as
given
by
the
court
in
jenks.
now,
i
have
listened
here
to
brother
davis
and
i
have
read
the
congressional
debates
over
and
over
again,
and
there
are
pious
avowals
by
all
of
the
legislators
and
by
the
government
here
that
nobody
indented
to
touch
jenks
by
this
legislation,
that
all
that
they
wanted
to
do
is
to
codify
it.
well,
if
what
the
government
is
contending
for
here
is
so,
they
certainly
went
way
past
any
codification.
in
fact,
they
put
jenks
right
out
of
--
out
of
the
business.
if
this
court
holds
that
the
statute
is
exclusive
and
if
this
court
holds
that
it's
constitutional,
i,
for
the
life
of
me,
cannot
see
the
objection
by
the
government
to
the
production
of
any
report
of
what
a
witness
said.
there
is
no
fishing
expedition
involved
in
this
case.
the
precise
report
was
identified
in
the
trial
court.
and
i
do
not
see
why
the
government
should
not
produce
it.
in
fact,
outside
of
jenks,
it
seems
to
me
that
berger,
a
famous
decision
of
this
court,
requires,
as
to
--
as
to
the
canons
of
ethics
that
a
prosecutor
turned
over
to
a
defendant,
any
material
which
he
may
have,
any
evidence,
if
you
will,
which
he
may
have
which
is
helpful
to
the
defendant.
and
i
think,
really,
that
was
the
philosophy
of
this
court
in
handing
down
jenks.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
some
remark
was
made
here
yesterday
that
--
as
to
the
lutwak
case.
i
appeared
before
the
court
and
argued
that
particular
case
and
we
lost
it
on
a
5-3
decision.
and,
i
think
mr.
davis
said
that
the
majority
opinion,
applying
the
--
the
language
here,
stated
that
the
record
shrieked
of
error.
and,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
before
i
conclude,
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
jackson
dissented
from
the
theory
that
the
record
did
shriek
of
error.
and
i
say
--
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
anthony
bradley
eben
thank
you,
very
much.
