mr.
albert
h.
treiman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
trial
counsel
in
the
original
trial
and
i
also
appealed
--
appeared
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
now,
i'd
like
to
start
off
my
argument
by
answering
some
of
the
questions
that
were
put
to
my
colleague.
first
of
all,
this
--
the
question
of
carlin's
statement,
we
had
never
been
given
an
opportunity
to
examine
it.
we
were
never
made
aware
that
such
a
thing
did
or
did
not
exist
until
after
our
briefs
had
been
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
was
in
answer
to
our
briefs
that,
for
the
first
time,
we
were
advised
through
the
government's
briefs
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
statement
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
point
and
that
the
statement
was
barren
of
the
requirements
of
3500,
and
that
the
government
was
relying
upon
or
submitted
that
statement
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
examination.
up
to
that
point,
we
never
even
knew
whether
such
a
statement
existed
except
by
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
witness
carlin
form
the
witness
stand
who
had
said
he
believed
he
had
signed
such
a
statement.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
the
only
knowledge
we
had
of
the
document
whatsoever
was
when
we
received
copies
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
submitted
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
statement
filed
with
the
court.
prior
to
that,
we
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever.
we
have
never
even
seen
the
affidavit
itself,
except
that
the
copy
of
the
affidavit
appeared
in
the
answering
briefs
of
the
government.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
we
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
improper
for
the
government,
at
that
point,
to
submit
an
ex
parte
affidavit
in
support
of
the
contention
that
no
such
document
existed.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
on
oral
argument,
your
honor,
because
the
matter
was
submitted
shortly
before
oral
argument.
it
was
presented
for
us
--
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
i
believe
some
of
us
had
filed
a
reply
brief,
yes.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
at
the
very
last
moment,
just
before
walking
into
the
court
of
appeals
to
argue.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
it
was
submitted
at
the
same
time
that
the
--
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
i
do
not
know
the
date,
sir.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
no.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
no,
i
--
no,
i
believe
that
is
not
correct,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
ex
parte
affidavit
was
filed
simultaneously
--
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
--
with
the
government's
brief.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
well,
it
was
ex
parte
in
this
sense
that
it
was
made
a
--
a
part
of
the
record
without
our
knowledge
that
it
was
going
to
be
made
a
part
of
our
record
and
it
was
submitted
after
we
had
--
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
--
submitted
our
briefs.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
we
were
served
copies
of
the
affidavit
simultaneously
with
the
brief.
it
was
contained
in
the
brief
--
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
--
in
the
answering
briefs.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
that's
correct.
and,
that
was
the
first
knowledge
we
had.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
well,
may
i
continue
with
the
argument.
one
of
the
contentions
that
we
wish
to
submit
is
this,
that
the
entire
picture
of
the
course
of
the
trial
must
be
taken
to
consideration
as
to
the
relevance
of
this
particular
incident
as
to
carlin's
statement.
there
were
six
defendants
on
trial.
each
represented
by
their
own
counsel.
as
a
result,
we
had
agreed
with
the
government
and
with
justice
kaufman
that
an
objection
taken
by
one
would
be
an
objection
covering
all,
unless
one
of
the
attorneys
chose
to
take
some
other
course
of
action.
this
was
done
with
the
hope
that
it
would
expedite
the
trial,
and
i
respectfully
call
to
your
honor's
attention
that
this
trial
took
six
weeks
to
the
day,
from
the
date
that
the
jury
was
poke
--
picked,
rather,
to
the
date
that
the
jury
came
back
with
a
verdict.
and,
it
was
hoped
that,
by
following
this
particular
course
of
conduct,
we
could
expedite
the
trail
rather
than
have
the
trial
prolonged
even
further.
therefore,
when
the
counsel
went
into
cross-examination,
we
were
seated
at
the
counsel
table
in
the
same
order
in
which
the
defendants
were
named
in
the
indictment.
consequently,
lev,
having
appeared
as
number
one
defendant
in
the
indictment,
lev's
counsel
sat
as
the
first
attorney
to
cross-examine
the
witness,
and
so
on
down
the
line,
and,
it
was
intended
that,
by
following
this
orderly
procedure,
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
repetition
of
having
each
attorney
come
into
the
same
line
of
cross-examination
if
that
line
of
cross-examination
had
already
been
covered
by
the
attorney
who
had
cross-examined
just
before
he
did.
now,
it
is
on
that
basis
that
when
carlin
testified,
and
he
was
one
of
the
first,
in
fact,
probably
the
first
material
witness
that
was
called
to
the
stand,
after
having
submitted
various
exhibits
in
evidence
that
were
very
lengthy
and
so
forth,
when
he
was
called
to
the
stand,
the
testimony
that
he
presented
was
very
material
to
the
issues
in
this
regard.
first
of
all,
he
was
an
accountant
and
he
was
not
one
of
the
parties
involved
in
the
partiular
transactions
that
were
later
disclosed.
now,
when
carlin
testified,
he
set
the
groundwork
for
what
purported
to
be
a
conspiracy
but,
at
the
time
of
the
--
rather,
the
period
of
time
that
he
described
did
not
affect
the
defendant
lev,
did
not
affect
the
defendant
wool,
whom
i
represented,
because
both
lev
and
wool
came
into
the
picture
in
this
quartermaster
setup
which
later
became,
commonly
referred
to
as
astapa.
approximately,
a
year
later
or
some
nine
months
later,
in
any
event,
any
description
of
the
events
that
took
place
in
carlin's
testimony,
preceded
by
some
nine
months
where
he
discussed
what
was
going
on
amongst
rubin
and
the
partners,
namely,
levy
and
ades.
so
that,
when
the
point
came
up
for
cross-examination,
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
cross-examine,
when
i
say
us,
i
mean
counsel
for
lev
and
counsel
for
wool,
because
there
was
no
mention
of
him
nor
would
there
be
any
materiality
in
cross-examining
him.
but,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
had
ruled
that
we
could
not
examine
any
document
until
we
can
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
there
was
something
contradictory
between
the
testimony
given
by
the
witness
on
the
witness
stand
and
that
which
he
had
given
in
some
previous
document
and,
since
we
had
already
agreed
on
our
procedures
as
to
objections
and
exceptions
taken
and
so
forth,
it
then
became
a
futility
for
us
to
come
with
each
witness
to
make
the
same
request
again.
in
fact,
it
even
served
to
hurt
us
a
little
bit
deeper
than
that
because,
when
carlin
testified
that
he
had
in
fact
signed
such
a
statement
or
be
it
that
he
believed
he
had
singed
such
a
statement
and
then
we
were
denied
the
statement,
certainly,
the
jury
had
a
right
to
assume
from
that
that
he
had,
in
fact,
adopted
such
a
statement
and
that,
if
the
statement
had
been
produced,
it
would
have
borne
out
exactly
what
he
had
testified
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
that
--
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
it
was
in
a
form
of
a
pretrial
stipulation,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
i
don't
know.
it
may
be
in
the
pretrial
part
of
the
record.
there
was
such
a
stipulation
amongst
all
counsel.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
it
related
to
objections.
it
related
to,
also,
requests
that
were
made.
in
other
words,
if
counsel
number
one
who
appeared
for
mr.
lev
made
a
request
and
that
request
was
denied
and
then
objection
was
made
to
the
denial
of
the
request,
the
objection
went
down
the
line
for
all
of
us.
now,
this
appears
in
the
transcript
of
the
record.
i
don't
believe
it
appears
in
the
record
here.
but,
in
the
transcript,
it
does
appear
that
there
was
this
agreement
made
amongst
counsel.
mr.
albert
h.
treiman
with
the
court.
in
fact,
at
--
may
i
suggest,
at
the
suggestion
of
the
court,
in
order
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
having
each
attorney
pop
up
each
time
that
a
question
was
raised,
so
that
we
would
only
have
a
series
of
objections
down
the
line,
there
were
six
of
us
sitting
there,
rather
than
proceed
with
the
normally
--
normal
procedure
of
the
trial.
we
also
stipulated
further
that,
in
the
event
someone
opposed
an
objection,
that
is
one
of
defense
counsel,
only
in
that
even
would
he
rise
to
speak
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
particular
objection.
now,
i
don't
wish
to
encroach
on
my
colleague's
further
time
and
i
will
permit
him
to
go
into
his
argument,
but
i
merely
wish
to
clarify
the
issues
that
your
honors
brought
up
at
this
point.
thank
you.
