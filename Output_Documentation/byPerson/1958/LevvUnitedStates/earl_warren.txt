we'll

chief

mr.
eben,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl

go
ahead,
finish
your

mr.
treiman.
chief
justice
earl

were
you
served
copies
of
the
pleading,
of
the
affidavit
itself?

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
a
recording,
you
mean
mechanical
recording?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
would
be
admissible
but
it
was
not
authenticated
by
the
witness,
it
would
not
be
usable
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
tell
you
--
and
maybe
i
don't
quite
understand.
here's
what
i
was
wondering
about.
suppose
in
this
case
that
carlin
had
given
the
statement
to
the
governmental
agency
to
the
opposite
effect
to
that
which
he
testified
to
on
the
trial.
and,
the
government
had
that
statement
as
recorded
by
the
government
agent
in
its
possession.
we'll
say
that
it
wasn't
verbatim
and
he
just
said
“oh,
we
talked
for
an
hour
but
he
denied
any
knowledge
on
this
subject.
he
denied
this
was
true
exactly.”
under
the
jencks
statute,
could
they
get
passed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
not
get
passed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
would
not
be
admissible
in
evidence
but
it
could
be
used
--
it
could
be
used
by
the
defense,
certainly,
in
cross-examination.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
it's
formed
in
that
substance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
that
in
the
morning.

mr.
davis,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
a
--
an
agent
interviews
a
witness
and
he
says
“well,
now,
we'll
talk
about
this
or
talk
about
that,”
something
that
is
not
particularly
connected
with
the
case
and
maybe
they'll
talk
for
an
hour
or
so,
and
then,
he'd
get
down
to
business
and
he'll
talk
about
two
things
in
the
case
and
he'll
record,
in
the
55
lines
that
you
were
talking
about,
the
vital
things,
but
he
puts
on
the
top
that
“i
talked
to
this
man
for
an
hour-and-a
half
and
this
does
not
purport
to
be
a
verbatim
or
a
substantial
report
of
our
entire
conversation.
and,
the
witness
testifies
and
he's
asked
about
the
report
and
asked
to
see
the
report.
would
that
eliminate
the
use
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
who's
going
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
who's
going
to
decide
that
if
the
report
itself
says
“i
talked
to
him
for
an
hour-and-a
half
and
this
is
all
i'm
recording.
it
isn't
everything
we
talked
about,
but
--
nor
is
it
substantially
all
we
talked
about,
but
this
is
what
i
put
on
the
files”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
you
don't
mean
that
this
document
was
in
no
way
available
to
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
through
our
clerk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
anytime
you
want
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
going
to
argue,
from
what
was
in
this
document,
that
it's
harmless
error?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there's
some
time
at
some
of
these
other
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
you
state
your
general
proposition.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sullivan,
i
understand
you're
to
conclude
for
--
in
number
437.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
divide
your
time
any
way
you
want.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
cases
are
consolidated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
eben.
