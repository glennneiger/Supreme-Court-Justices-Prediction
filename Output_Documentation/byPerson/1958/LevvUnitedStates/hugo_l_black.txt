how
do
you
say
that
it
violates
the
constitutional

justice

is
he
compel
--
the
defendant
should
be
allowed
to
call
witnesses
in
their
behalf,
to
be
confronted
by
witnesses.
how
did
you
say
it
violates
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
argue
that
you
have
a
right
to
summon
witnesses
to
bring
papers,
as
well
as
to
summon
witnesses
for
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
the
witness
may
decide
it
indeterminately.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
only
constitutional
question
you've
raised.
justice
hugo
l.

why
do
you
have
to
learn
it?
you
mean,
the
court
has
to
know
that
your
summon

not

justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
has
to
know
that
your
summon
does
not
prove
it.
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
how
you
learn
it
or
present
it
if
you
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
have
anything
that's
on
the
constitutional
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
constitutional
protection
of
a
defendant
to
summon
witnesses
in
his
own
behalf,
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
raising
there?
well,
to
summon
the
witness
is
all
you
son
ask,
does
that
mean
that
he
can
summon
witnesses
to
bring
papers
that
are
known
to
be
relevant
or
have
reasonable
ground
to
believe
to
be
relevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
regard
to
cross-examination,
i
suppose
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
that
particular
part
of
your
argument
come
within
the
constitutional
provision
that
authorizes
the
defendant
to
summon
witnesses
in
his
behalf?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you
go
to
confrontation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
were
known,
absolute
unknown,
that
the
evidence
is
very
relevant
for
a
defendant,
what
position
do
you
take
on
evidence
that
the
constitutional
provision
that
authorizes
you
to
summon
the
witness
and
give
a
testimony
on
his
behalf?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
were
claiming
that
it
violates
the
constitutional
protection
and
i'm
trying
to
find
out
which
one,
in
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
treat
confrontation
as
including
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
cross-examination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
knows,
this
is
the
first
of
the
series
of
six
cases,
all
involving,
to
a
greater
or
less
extent,
demands
for
production
of
certain
kinds
of
documents
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
because
the
court
has
allotted
a
greater
period
of
time
to
this
case
than
to
the
succeeding
cases,
i
shall
try
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
all
the
cases
by
discussion
of
the
so-called
jencks
act,
18
usc
3500,
as
well
as
our
understanding
of
the
jencks
decision,
as
well
as
to
try
the
deal
with
this
particular
case
which
is
now
before
the
court.
i
believe
it
would
be
helpful
for
me
if
i
may
just
summarize
very
briefly
some
of
the
differences
between
this
case
and
the
succeeding
cases
so
that
the
court
might
have
it
in
mind
as
the
series
progresses.
this
case,
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
is
a
trial
prior
to
the
jencks
decision.
it
involves
what
the
government
claims
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
found
was
a
summary
of
a
witness'
testimony.
it
also
involves
a
claim
by
the
government
that
the
refusal
to
admit
--
to
produce
the
document,
the
summary,
was
harmless
error.
involves
a
document
not
by
one
of
the
investigative
branches
of
the
executive
government
--
executive
department,
but
a
senate
committee
investigation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
you
are
going
--
intend
to
take
up,
during
the
argument,
any
of
these
cases?
are
you
suggesting
that
what
he's
done
is
either
a
violation
of
the
constitution
or
comes
so
closely
within
that
range
that
the
court
should
consider
it
in
construing?
i
mean,
with
reference
to
the
two
provisions
of
the
sixth
amendment,
one,
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
prosecution
has
a
right
to
be
confronted
with
witnesses
against
him
and,
two,
they
have
to
consult
your
office
or
obtain
reference
to
it.
i
ask
that
on
this
basis.
they
claim
they've
been
denied
the
right
of
cross-examination.
that
may
or
may
not.
so,
answer
this.
the
other
is,
i
suppose,
that
--
if
you
decide
this
question
--
assert
yours
is
not
in
here,
you
decide
you've
got
proof.
i
suppose
that
if
the
witness
working
for
the
government
or
the
department
of
justice
or
someone
where
a
man
was
charged
with
murder
and
he
could
be
compelled
to
come
without
claiming
any
privilege.
i
don't
suppose
there'd
be
any
doubts
there,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
being
the
case,
that
he
is
someone
to
bring
certain
papers
that
are
remedy
in
a
criminal
case,
would
a
refusal
to
deny
him
the
benefit
of
the
--
on
the
ground
that
privilege
come
in
contrary
to
the
constitutional
provision
which
give
them
the
right
to
the
compulsory
attendant
provision.
i
don't
ask
you
to
do
it
now,
but
i'll
--
i
just
hope,
before
the
case
is
over,
that
you
will
read
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
ask
you
that
on
the
basis
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
probably,
in
construing
the
jencks
rule
of
the
statute,
that
the
problem
might
come
up
as
to
whether
the
construction
one
way
might
amount
to
the
denial
of
rights
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
to
ask.
i
don't
care
to
rush
you.
i
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
the
cases
were
up
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
getting
to
it.
i
just
hope
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--during
your
time,
you'll
discuss
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
--
i
don't
want
to
get
in
and
argue
with
that
bit,
but
does
that
necessarily
always
follow?
many
witnesses.
there's
someone
to
bring
papers
that
are
relevant
to
criminal
cases
for
defense
but
not
prepared
by
the
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
now
about
the
cross-examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that,
if
such
--
they
speak
without
it
determined.
what
you're
saying
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
it
says.
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
that
was
the
issue
presented
in
the
jenks
case,
presumably,
the
decision
was
directed
to
that
issue.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
denied
it.
suppose
he
--
suppose
he
denied
that
the
man
had
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
discretion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
the
value
in
it
would
be
is
the
statement
that
the
man
would
have
said
you
knew
nothing
about
the
case,
which
is
always
a
relevant
thing
where
the
witness
who
testifies
against
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
congress,
in
your
judgment,
provide
that
evidence
which
is
relevant
to
the
defense
on
question
of
the
relevance
can
be
denied
that
the
defense
and
go
on
with
his
trial
on
the
basis
that
it
would
be
bad
for
the
government
interest
to
supply
this
relevant,
very
important
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
--
suppose
this
piece
of
paper
which
has
not
been
seen
by
the
counsel,
saying
the
statement
by
the
officer
that
“this
witness
told
me
he
hated
this
man,
had
been
an
enemy
of
his
for
a
long
time,
and
then
he
proceeded
to
talk
but
i
have
not
set
out
substantially
what
he
said.”
would
that
be
admissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
didn't
--
suppose
he
wouldn't
tell
you,
and
suppose
the
defendant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
show
that
that
was
in
it
without
seeing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
to
--
as
to
all
he
is
held
that
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
approaches
the
problem
that
arises
in
my
mind
that
you
haven't
mentioned.
it
may
not
rise
to
the
constitutional
level,
but
it's
there.
every
trial
lawyer
recognizes,
who
has
tried
lawsuits,
that
you
need
information
to
cross-examine.
here,
the
only
person
that
will
have
the
information
is
the
judge.
the
other
man
cannot
look
to
see
whether
there
are
probably
conclusions
to
be
reached
different
to
the
conclusion
that
the
judge
might
reach.
history,
unfortunately,
records
the
fact
that,
sometimes,
judges
might
be
wrong
for
one
reason
or
another
and
the
defendant
might
not
have
the
slightest
knowledge
of
what
is
in
that
paper.
it
might
be
on
the
borderline.
the
judge
might
think
it's
not
and
yet
they're
--
you
have
to
have
them.
the
--
the
lawyer
needs
--
i'm
saying
this
may
not
arrive
to
a
constitutional
level,
but
i'm
talking
about
in
practice.
when
you
try
a
civil
case
or
a
criminal
case,
the
rule
with
which
i've
always
been
familiar
with
is,
if
the
judge
doesn't
take
your
papers
and
look
at
it
secretly,
would
that
--
and
deny
to
whichever
counsel
needs
the
information
the
right
to
look
at
it,
to
present
his
views
and
his
arguments,
but
it
--
both
look
at
it.
here,
congress
has
adopted
a
rule
which
forbids
anyone
but
the
judge
to
look
at
it,
unless
it
would
be
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
some
instances.
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant
cannot
see
it.
it
may
be
that
the
judge
looks
it
and
has
a
very
guilty
man
and
so
forth,
and
the
case
is
strong.
he
reaches
the
conclusion
that
“after
all,
we
can't
waste
time
letting
counsel
look
at
this.
it
won't
do
the
man
any
harm.”
is
there
anything
in
your
judgment
to
the
idea
of
passing
the
evidence?
when
you
permit
the
judge
in
his
discretion
in
camera
to
look,
he
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
knows
what's
in
it
and
you
do
not
let
the
defendant
have
any
look
on
it
at
all,
how
can
you
say
that
the
defendant
can
be
protected
by
his
asking
the
proper
questions
to
the
witnesses,
so
as
to
bring
out
the
facts
that
would
make
this
admissible?
how
--
how
does
that
give
him
the
be
--
full
benefit
of
having
witnesses
in
his
behalf,
confronted
by
him,
with
his
chance
to
cross-examine
them
with
knowledge
a
lawyer
would
have
to
have
in
order
to
cross-examine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
constitutional
level.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
agree,
do
you
not,
that
there
are
some
things
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
see
and
some
witnesses
he
has
a
right
to
have,
under
the
constitution,
whether
congress
wants
him
to
have
it
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
are
getting
here
into
the
area
of
whether
this
is
one
of
those
instances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
different,
as
all
court
proceedings
differ.
the
constitution
sets
out
a
large
number
of
things
that
congress
can't
do,
and
even
that
courts
cannot
do.
it
tells
the
courts
that
they
must
try
people
in
certain
ways
to
accuse
a
crime.
so
that,
it's
not
enough,
is
it,
to
say
that
congress
can
determine
which
instrument
will
be
used,
finally
and
secretly,
to
say
whether
or
not
a
defendant's
rights
have
been
accorded
with?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
an
old
argument.
it's
made
before
the
bill
of
rights,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
many
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
make
the
clerk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
they'd
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
rule
say
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
does
the
rule
say
that,
in
a
criminal
case
that
a
prosecutor
has
available
to
him
(inaudible)
that
statement
that
may
be
relevant,
that
he
can
look
at
them
and
then
he
can
present
it
to
the
judge
and
the
other
man
cannot
look
at
them,
and
the
judge
passes
on
it
in
camera?
i'm
not
sure.
