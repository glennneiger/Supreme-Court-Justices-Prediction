mr.
john
t.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
was
i
who
made
the
objection.
it
was
i
who
asked
carlin
to
produce
the
statement,
and
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
frankfurter
very
clearly
that
i
don't
think
there
was
any
skulduggeryon
the
part
of
the
united
states
attorney.
i
have
the
utmost
respect
from
mr.
arthur
christy
who
tried
this
case,
a
very,
very
fine
able
young
man.
what
happened
was
this.
they
--
i
believe
mr.
christy
said
to
me,
call
me,
or
sent
me
a
copy
of
the
affidavit.
it
was
virtually
contemporaneous
with
the
brief,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
so
that,
we
did
have
the
opportunity,
if
we
wanted
to,
to
make
an
application
of
some
description
to
the
court
of
appeals.
however,
in
view
of
the
condition
of
the
record,
i
saw
no
reason
for
doing
that.
i
had
asked
this
witness
carlin
whether
or
not
he
had
been
interviewed.
i
had
asked
him
whether
he
had
given
a
statement.
he
said
“i
believe
i
have.”
now,
there's
one
aspect
of
it
that
i
think
is
most
important
at
this
particular
point.
when
i
made
that
request,
the
first
thing
that
the
district
attorney
said
was
that
no
foundation
has
been
laid,
and
then,
the
court,
no
foundation
was
laid
even
to
ask
the
question
whether
he
had
given
a
statement.
then,
that
was
overruled.
then,
after
that,
when
i
asked
for
the
statement,
the
district
attorney
opposed
on
the
ground
that
i
had
made
--
laid
no
foundation.
now,
i
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
gordon
case.
i
considered,
at
that
time,
myself
that
the
rule
in
the
second
circuit
was
entirely
erroneous
and
i
couldn't
understand
why
statements
such
as
might
be
in
the
possession
of
the
government
which
were
not
state
secrets,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
we
couldn't
have
them.
to
me,
it
seemed
co
--incompatible
with
justice
that
the
department
of
justice,
the
district
attorney
can
hold
papers
which
you
--
from
you
but
you
can't
get
them
from
him,
so
that,
it
was
my
sincere
urging
at
that
time
that
i
be
given.
and,
i
quoted
the
gordon
case.
well,
judge
kaufman
said
not
only
would
he
give
it
to
me,
ut
he
wouldn't
even
look
at
the
statement.
he
said
“now,
i
would
like
to
know
how
i
could
possibly
know
whether
there
was
an
inconsistency
in
a
statement
that
he
wouldn't
even
look
at
himself
or
let
me
see.”
all
this
time,
the
district
attorney
was
continualing
--
continually
arguing
as
if
there
was
such
a
statement.
i
was
clearly
let
off
my
guard.
now,
i
don't
think
that
mr.
christy
did
that
deliberately.
i'm
sure
he
didn't,
knowing
him
so
well,
and
i
state
that
in
my
brief.
but,
i
was
completely
led
astray.
i
would
have
made
that
objection.
i
had
discussed
it
with
my
--
with
my
co-counsel.
i
had
discussed
it
with
mr.
lev's
counsel,
with
mr.
treiman.
i
had
intended
to
get
every
statement.
i
knew
that
there
were
many
statements.
this
case
had
started
with
the
mcclellan
committee.
there
was
hardly
a
law
enforcement
bureau
that
wasn't
in
this,
and
i
was
very,
very,
very
anxious
to
get
those
statements
and
i
believe
that
i
was
deprived
of
those
statements
by
things
which
were
not
exactly
right.
once
again,
i
say
no
real
active
intention
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney.
if
your
honor
please,
when
i
argued,
and
i
went
back
again
to
judge
kaufman,
i
argue
the
proposition
with
him
again
and
he
delivered
himself
of
that
opinion.
so
that,
i
felt
that
if
were
to
continually
assert
the
proposition
that
i
want
this
statement,
i
have
a
great
respect
for
the
judge
who
is
sitting
in
the
case.
as
a
defense
lawyer,
i
do
not
want
to
seem
disrespectful
in
any
way
and
i
don't
think
it
helps
the
cause
of
your
client
by
doing
that.
so,
then,
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
would
have
to
drop
that,
although
i
felt
that
judge
kaufman
was
absolutely
wrong
about
his
contention.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
don't
see
either.
in
any
event,
i
could
have
if
you
--
pardon
me,
your
honor.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
has
brought
into
this
case
the
question
of
harmless
error
and
has
made
a
lot
of
comments
in
his
brief,
characterizations
which
i
think
are
pretty
much
fortuitous
about
the
facts.
i
think,
i
can
assist
your
honors
greatly
by
giving
you
the
facts
as
i
know
them.
i
believe
i
know
them
better
that
anybody.
i
took
more
part
in
this
trial
than
anyone.
i
open
to
the
jury
or
i
closed.
i
did
the
whole
job
there
and
i
think
that
i
know
the
facts
as
well
as
anyone.
what
actually
happen
in
this
case
was,
you
had
a
little
company
called
“bonita”
which
was
in
puerto
rico.
bonita
had
two
partners,
levy
and
ades.
levy
and
ades
came
from
the
middle
east
and
they
had
been
there.
ades
had
been
from
brooklyn
and
he
went
to
puerto
rico.
so,
they
had
this
little
embroidery
business
and
they
were
going
nowhere,
and
they
met
marvin
rubin,
another
young
fellow
from
brooklyn.
and,
marvin
rubin
then
said
the
he
could
get
them
business.
he
have
had
some
experience
in
procurement
matters,
so
that
they
got
together
and
they
started
to
try
to
do
something
with
this
enterprise
in
puerto
rico.
now,
the
only
thing
that
distinguished
the
enterprise
in
puerto
rico
was,
in
puerto
rico,
you
got
a
low-wage
scale
and
the
people
down
there
can
handle
the
needle
business
pretty
well.
so,
that
was
all
there
was
to
that
enterprise.
it
was
just
a
little
kitchen
table
enterprise
that
didn't
amount
to
anything.
and,
so,
rubin
went
in
and
rubin
got
contracts.
now,
i'm
giving
you
these
facts
to
show
you
that
characterization,
such
as
the
solicitor
general
makes
to
the
effect
of
overwhelming
testimony,
that
carlin
was
only
secondary.
this,
if
your
honors
please,
is
far
from
the
truth.
these
were
very
close
questions
of
fact.
as
witness
to
the
fact
that
one
defendant
was
acqui
--
acquitted,
as
witness
to
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
out
for
an
extended
period
of
time
going
into
its
second
day,
as
witness
to
the
fact
they
came
back
14
times
for
instructions,
as
witness
to
the
fact
they
asked
that
the
cross-examination
of
carlin
be
read.
so
that,
carlin's
testimony
was
not
secondary.
it
was
very
critical.
it
was
the
foundation
stone
of
their
case.
now,
if
your
honors
pleas,
there
were
only
three
witnesses
for
the
government.
sure,
there
were
27,
but
there
were
only
3
real
witnesses.
there
was
levy,
the
former
partner
of
ades,
the
man
who
was
dissatisfied
because
he
wasn't
taken
on
the
white
hat
contact.
there
was
addison.
there
was
porreca,
the
chief
inspector,
and
there
was
carlin.
carlin
was
the
--
one
of
the
main
stones
of
this
entire
case
and
it
cannot
be
stated
by
the
solicitor
general
or
any
one
else
that
his
testimony
was
secondary,
that
it
was
not
anything
that
had
a
bearing
on
the
issue.
the
things
that
they
did,
naturally,
they
try
to
do
everything
they
possibly
could
with
the
inspection
service.
they
try
to
get
all
the
favors.
they
could,
with
all
these
contractors,
operate
this
way.
they
naturally
didn't
go
in
and
insult
the
inspectors,
so
that,
there
came
a
time
that
a
great
white
hat
procurement
was
coming
up.
this
was
a
very
big
contract
and
this,
of
course,
could
be
manufactured
in
puerto
rico
much
more
cheaply
than
any
where
else
in
the
united
states.
by
this
time,
mr.
rubin,
the
able,
eager
promoter,
mr.
rubin
was
a
promoter.
he
decided
at
that
point
that
if
he
could
--
he
had
met
harry
lev.
harry
lev
was
a
big
tycoon
of
hat
manufacturing
in
chicago
and
he
could
get
harry
lev
to
take
that
contract,
there
c
--
they
could
make
a
lot
of
money
down
there.
well,
all
this
happen.
harry
lev
took
the
contract.
they
built
a
plan.
harry
lev
was
a
very
great
manufacturer
of
hats,
and
harry
lev
had
so
--
save
the
government,
i
would
say,
millions
of
dollars
over
the
years
with
his
methods
of
manufacturing
hats.
there
was
no
real
depriving
of
the
government
of
any
money
here.
this
case
was
built
up
on
the
basis
of
the
mcclellan
hearings.
this
was
the
very
first
big
publicity
that
that
committee
had.
out
came
the
lev
case.
mr.
lev
was
an
object
of
quite
a
lot
of
interest
due
to
his
personal
characteristics
and,
as
result
of
that,
this
case
came
to
pass.
and,
so
then,
they
started
reaching
out
to
get
this
piece
of
evidence
and
that
piece
of
evidence
and
put
a
twist
on
one
thing.
and,
i'd
like
the
court
here,
court's
attention
to
one
particular
thing.
there
was
a
contract
called
the
wollman
contract.
they
stated
why,
due
to
improprieties,
mr.
rubin
had
caused
the
wollman
contract
to
be
canceled
and
he
took
it
over.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
this
is
directed,
judge
--
justice
harlan,
to
the
solicitor
general's
statement
of
the
overwhelming
proof.
i
just
want
to
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
harmless
error,
if
your
honor
please.
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
when
you
see
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
you'll
see
it
largely
argues
on
the
overwhelming
proof
and
on
the
harmless
error,
and
i
--
the
only
reason
that
i
saw
fit
to
inject
these
facts
is
because
of
the
fact
that
those
statements
have
a
name.
however,
i
say
to
your
honors,
in
conclusion,
that
i
agree
with
you
that
it
probably
is
something
that
is
not
really
an
issue
under
the
order
that
this
court
has
made,
but
i
say
that
there
was
no
--
that
it
could
never
be
cured
under
harmless
error
statute,
what
transpired
here.
in
this
very
close
case,
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
not
giving
me
access
to
the
--
to
the
statements
of
the
government
witnesses,
which
surely
were
in
existence,
if
the
court
please,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
were
many,
many
statements
in
existence
with
respect
to
all
of
the
government
witnesses,
particularly,
the
three
critical
government
witnesses
porreca,
levy,
and
carlin.
so
that,
i
assure
the
court
that,
from
the
standpoint
of
harmless
error,
i
feel
that
even
though
i
submit
that
harmless
error
would
not
overcome
the
doctrine
of
the
jencks
case,
i
say
that
it
isn't
here
for
this
court
to
consider
because
this
is
not
an
incident
where
harmless
error
could
ever
result
in
a
decision
by
this
court.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
did
not
make
any
further
request
for
any
further
papers
in
view
of
judge
kaufman's
emphatic
exposition
of
his
understanding
of
the
law.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
now,
if
the
court
please,
with
respect
to
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
rendering
a
decision
which
held
that,
because
of
the
enactment
of
the
supervening
statute,
that
it
was
harmless
error.
i
state
that
the
affidavit
which
was
submitted,
as
my
colleague,
mr.
eben,
pointed
out,
in
the
affidavit
which
was
submitted
was
most
equivocal
in
stating
whether
a
--
in
stating
whether
or
not
what
had
been
given
was
a
verbatim
statement.
what
belavan
stated
was
that
he
had
interviewed
the
witness
and
that
he,
thereafter,
came
back
and
dictated
a
memorandum.
and,
on
the
basis
--
and
that
he
submitted
that
memorandum
to
the
chief
counsel
robert
kennedy
and
his
statement
was
clearly
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
know
whether
or
not
--
he
did
not
know
whether
or
not
it
was
substantially
verbatim.
he
said
it
was
just
a
general
--
general
statement
about
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
quite
obvious
that
if
belavan
and
cool
were
there
to
see
carlin,
they
were
there
to
see
him
to
get
a
statement
from
him.
to
get
carlin's
version
of
what
had
transpired.
to
ask
carlin's
--
carlin
questions.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that,
to
go
off
on
the
technicality,
this
is
not
a
verbatim
recording.
this
is
not
a
verbatim
transposition
of
what
he
said.
affords
the
law
enforcement
agencies
an
opportunity
to
merely
put
a
heading
on
the
--
the
bottom
of
--
on
the
top
of
one
of
their
reports
and
say
“memorandum
to
so-and-so,”
and
then
it
doesn't
become
a
verbatim
recording.
i
say
that
if
that
particular
part
of
the
statute
is
upheld,
it's
clearly
unconstitutional.
it
is
not
due
process.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
unconstitutional
on
the
grounds
that,
by
virtue
of
this
trick
or
devise,
they
have
prevented
confrontation
and
cross-examination,
justice
harlan.
i
say
that
the
sacred
thing,
the
way
every
defense
lawyer
knows
that
cross-examination
is
your
greatest
weapon.
and,
i
say
that
he's
limited
cross-examination
for
no
reason.
there
is
no
state
secret
involved.
there
is
no
possible
reason
why
the
department
of
justice
or
the
prosecutor
should,
after
their
witness
has
testified,
should
withhold
from
the
defense
a
statement
which
does
not
reveal
some
secret
of
the
department
of
justice.
it's
imposing
a
hardship,
a
handicap.
it
does
not
get
at
justice
at
all.
it
defeats
justice.
if
i
had
a
--
if
i,
as
defense
counsel,
have
papers
in
my
possession,
i
cannot
resist
the
subpoena
of
the
department
of
justice.
they
will
get
my
papers
if
they
want
them,
but
i
say
that
that
is
definitely
an
unconstitutional
abridgement
of
the
right
of
cross-examination
which,
i
submit
to
this
court,
is
probably
the
greatest
defense,
the
greatest
weapon
that
a
defendant
has
at
his
command
to
defeat
an
unjust
indictment.
the
c
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
it's
--
i
say
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
say
that
if
the
prosecutor
has
in
his
possession
a
statement
of
a
witness
whom
he
has
put
on
the
stand,
if
i
cannot
get
that
statement
or
the
statement
of
someone
who
has
questioned
him,
then
my
cross-examination
is
limited.
i
say
that
justice
is
defeated
by
that
method,
in
accordance
with
the
ruling
of
the
jencks
case.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
say
that
i
have
a
right
to
subpoena
those
papers.
once
i
find
they
are
in
existence.
once
i
determine
that
there
is
a
statement
in
existence
by
cross-examination
of
the
government
witness
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
determine
it
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
the
constitutional
question
i
raised,
justice
black,
is
that,
once
i
have
learned
that
there
is
such
statement
on
cross-examination
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
what
is
that,
justice
black?
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
don't
know
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
correct.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
yes,
he
can.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
that
may
--
that's
entirely
true,
justice
black,
but
the
cross-examination
is
the
means
whereby
i
learn
whether
or
not
they
are
in
existence.
i
dis
--
i
--
when
the
government
puts
a
witness
on
the
stand,
i
learn
that
he
has
given
a
statement.
that's
when
i
learned
it.
i
don't
know
it
before
because
i
do
not
have
access
to
the
government's
witnesses.
i
could
subpoena
them
and
put
them
on
the
stand,
but
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
if
the
court
please,
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
provides
for
cross-examination
and
confrontation,
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
yes.
i
--
i
don't
say
that
it
stops
me
from
serving
a
subpoena.
i
do
say
that,
after
i
have
learned
of
the
existence
of
that,
i
might
subpoena
the
f.b.i.
to
produce
a
record.
i
put
--
could
have
served
such
a
subpoena,
except
that
the
government
does
not
respond
to
subpoenas.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
say,
that
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
in
a
criminal
case,
that
is
a
limitation
and
an
abridgement
of
my
right
to
be
--
of
--
for
the
evidence
to
be
made
available
to
me.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
the
statement,
i
mean.
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
following,
justice
black,
very
well.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
well,
i
think
it
certainly
violates
the
constitution
on
the
fifth
amendment
as
to
due
process.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
also
say
that
not
to
permit
--
not
to
order
that
statement
to
be
produced
to
me
is
a
limitation
of
my
cross-examination.
it's
a
limitation
of
cross-examination,
and
i
say
that
cross-examination
is
involved
and
is
included
in
the
time
of
confrontation.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
including
cross-examination.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
i
guess
that's
my
answer
to
your
question.
so
that,
when
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
said
that,
because
of
the
supervening
statute
and
because
of
the
affidavit,
i
conclude
my
argument
by
stating
that
that,
once
again,
deprived
me
of
a
very,
very,
very,
valid
right.
i
wish
to
amplify
that
to
some
extent.
when
i
was
informed
--
when
i
was
informed
by
the
witness
that
he
believes
he
had
signed
a
statement,
and
when
the
district
attorney
led
me
further
into
the
morass
of
that
belief
that
there
was
such
a
statement,
and
i
then
went
--
had
the
colloquy
with
judge
kaufman
and
argued
the
proposition,
i
believe,
at
that
point,
that
i
had
been
given
a
decision,
a
clear-cut
decision.
i
--
i
considered
that
the
question
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
i
was
entitled
to
that
paper,
to
that
statement,
had
clearly
been
decided
and
there
was
not
point
to
my
repeating
it.
but,
i
found
that,
through
the
district
attorney
having
led
me
into
this
mistake,
that,
of
course,
i
didn't
have
a
clear-cut
decision.
but
then,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
affidavit
and
considered
the
statement
against
me.
i
was
defeated
in
both
places
by
what
i
considered
to
be
completely
extrajudicial
actions.
i
do
not
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
any
power
to
take
such
an
affidavit,
particularly
in
the
view
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and,
in
conclusion,
i
can
only
say
that
it
was
a
very,
very
close
issue
of
fact
in
this
case.
it
was
r
--
extremely
close
and
that,
if
i
had
been
able
to
get
the
statements,
if
judge
kaufman
had
even
expounded
the
law,
as
the
second
circuit
understood
it
at
the
time,
i
think
that
it
would
have
made
a
very
big
difference
in
the
result
of
this
trial.
if
he
had
given
me
the
understatements,
it's
my
belief
that
these
witnesses,
the
three
main
witnesses,
i
want
the
court
to
consider
who
they
were.
one
was
an
accomplice,
levy.
he
was
unindicted,
clearly
an
accomplice.
the
other
was
porreca,
who
said
he
took
a
bribe.
the
only
other
witness
that
the
government
submitted
that
really
bore
on
the
critical
issue
was
the
witness
carlin,
and
the
witness
carlin
was
the
very
first
witness.
he
was
a
certified
public
accountant.
he
was
a
witness
who
was,
well,
he
was
not
an
accomplice.
he
couldn't
be
held
to
be
guilty
of
the
crime.
and,
when
the
jury
came
back
and
asked
for
his
cross-examination
to
be
read
to
them
again,
it
shows
the
critical
nature
of
his
testimony,
and
i
endorsed
what
mr.
treiman
had
said
with
respect
to
the
objections.
judge
kaufman
really
streamlined
this
trial
by
stipulations
and
pretrial
conferences.
it
was
a
very
long
trial,
and
we
did
agree
to
do
these
rather
unusual
things
in
the
line
of
the
stipulations
and
limiting
objections,
and
so
forth.
well
i
might
also
add,
and
i
--
it's
rather
with
some
hesitation
that
i
say
this.
i
say
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
record
will
show
that
these
defendants
received
a
fair
trial.
i
believe,
and
i
stated
in
my
brief
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
it
was,
to
me,
obvious
throughout,
at
least
i
felt
that
way,
possibly
defense
counsel
always
feel
that
way
but,
i
felt
that
the
court
was
really
not
giving
me
the
fair
trial
i
think
i
was
entitled
to
and
was
reaching
out
for
the
conviction.
i
think
the
record
shows
that.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
court
to
afford
mr.
eben
the
opportunity
to
use
most
of
my
remaining
time.
i
think
i
would
like
to
use
five
minutes
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
and
--
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
thank
you.
mr.
john
t.
sullivan
if
the
court
please,
in
response
to
what
mr.
davis
just
said,
judge
kaufman
ruled,
not
only
that
he
wouldn't
have
the
statement
produced,
he
ruled
that
before
he
would
even
read
the
statement
that
i
had
to
show
it
had
inconsistency.
and,
of
course,
his
ruling
was
so
absolutely
clear-cut
that
i
couldn't
possibly
insult
the
court
further
by
pressing
the
objection
over
and
over.
now,
if
the
court
please,
yesterday,
of
course,
i
tried
to,
rather
laboriously,
go
through
the
facts
to
meet
the
contention
of
mr.
davis
that
this
is
overwhelming.
i
dispute
that
with
every
fiber
of
my
makeup.
this
was
a
clear-cut
case
of
credibility
of
a
few
key
witnesses.
that's
all
the
case
amounted
to.
the
decision
of
the
c
--
the
decision
of
the
jury
held
that
pollock
was
acquitted.
pollock
was
acquitted,
although
levi
had
positively
identified
him
as
receiving
the
money.
therefore,
the
jury
didn't
believe
pollock,
but
the
jury
did
believe
carlin.
carlin
was
a
very
important
witness,
and
i
say
to
this
court
that,
if
the
record
was
read
a
thousand
times,
there
never
could
be
any
overwhelming
interpretation
placed
upon
it.
now,
if
the
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
wish
also
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
relevance.
in
the
question
of
relevance,
it
is
my
understanding
that
i
do
not
have
to
prove
when
i
ask
for
the
production
of
a
statement
that
i
have
to
show
competence,
that
i
have
to
show
that
it's
admissible
in
evidence,
that
i
have
to
show
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
hearsay
rule.
i'm
seeking
these
--
these
papers
merely
to
use
them
to
impeach
the
credibility.
they
may
furnish
me
one
little
portion
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
which
will
really
bring
the
truth
out
in
the
criminal
case.
why
should
i
have
to
be
dependent
upon
that
charity
of
the
united
states
attorney,
upon
his
honor
and
his
integrity?
and,
i
must
say,
i
never
met
one
who
didn't
have
those
qualities,
but
why
must
we
be
faced
with
such
a
thing,
that
we
who
defend
people
in
the
courts
that
we
have
to
be
dependent
upon
the
united
states
attorney,
and
even
upon
the
bench,
that
we
may
not
see
a
document
to
save
a
man
from
the
destruction
of
his
life?
if
the
court
please,
i
must
say
that,
after
listening
to
the
argument
of
mr.
davis,
i
can
only
conclude
that
the
--
he
has
many
different
sides
to
his
argument.
his
--
he
says
that,
on
account
of
the
confusion
of
the
jencks
rule
with
the
law
of
courts,
that
that's
why
they
had
to
pass
a
new
statute.
he
says
that,
because
the
--
because
they
wanted
to
be
sure
to
codify
the
statute,
he
actually
--
he
actually
argues
in
his
brief,
in
my
opinion
as
i
read
it,
that
so
enamored
was
the
department
of
justice
and
the
courts
or,
rather,
the
congress
with
the
jencks
decision
that
they
decided
to
codify
it,
to
give
a
stat
--
so
that
subsequent
changes
in
the
personnel
in
this
court
wouldn't
affect
this
--
the
wonderful
rationale
of
that.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
is
sheer
hypocrisy.
i
say
that
the
--
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
overrule
and
get
him
off
the
books.
that's
the
purpose
and,
i
say,
that
this
statute
which
is
passed
in
such
a
hurry,
which
was
rushed
through
the
congress,
your
congressional
history
is
worthless,
worthless
to
determined
the
real
truth.
and,
the
real
truth
is
that
it
was
directed
strictly
against
us
and
i
say,
in
conclusion,
that
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
statute
and
the
application
of
this
statute,
in
this
case,
constitutes
a
direct
unconstitutional
violation
of
amendment
five
and
six
of
the
constitution.
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
