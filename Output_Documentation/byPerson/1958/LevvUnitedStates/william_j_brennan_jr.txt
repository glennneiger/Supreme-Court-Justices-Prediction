justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
defendant
tell
that
anyway?
you're
talking
about
carlin.
the
defendant
has
no
knowledge
as
to
what
carlin
signed
or
didn't
sign.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
a
government
witness,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
you
know
that?
how
would
you
be
in
the
position
to
find
out
without
producing
carlin
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
rely
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
eben,
i
gather,
you'd
never
seen
the
statement,
had
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
no
one
on
behalf
of
defendant
has
ever
seen
the
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
did
you
see
the
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
belavan
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
was
the
significance
to
the
affidavit
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
the
affidavits
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
affidavit,
does
there
appear
a
statement
that
the
sealed
envelope
with
the
statement
in
it
contained
a
statement
which
was
unsigned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does.
what
is
it
pointed
out
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
carlin
had
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
had
signed
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
you
discovered
this
from
the
government's
brief,
what
did
you
do
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
you
argue
this,
on
oral
argument
or
by
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
file
a
reply
brief
or
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
addressed
to
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
sure
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
sure
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
sure
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
had
the
wit
--
written
statements
of
matusow,
but
what
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
differ
the
statements
of
ford
from
the
statement
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
statement,
was
there
any
difference
than
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
than
their
character
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
ford
ever
see
the
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
ford
himself
make
the
statements
that
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
ford
himself
make
the
statements
that
we
had
before
us
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
well,
what
were
ford's
statements
that
--
were
they
merely
the
f.b.i.
agents
setting
down
what,
usually
by
telephone,
foretold
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
weren't
they
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
can't
really
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
know
how
this
statement
differs,
if
it
does
at
all,
with
the
one
we're
concern
with
here
from
the
type
of
statement
of
ford
that
we
have
before
us
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
those
ford
statements
still
with
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
understood
you
to
suggest
the
difference
between
this
statement
in
this
case
and
the
ford
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
were
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
longhand
dictations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
longhand
dictations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suppose
you'd
assume
that
the
--
what
we
dealt
with
was
what
we
had
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
suggest
that
the
ford
statements
were
longhand
statements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
anyone's
longhands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exclusive
procedure,
is
that
to
say
that
the
only
statements
of
satisfying
one
of
the
definitions
under
the
statute
and
were
producible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
put
any
weight
at
all
upon
the
fact
that,
as
i
recall
it,
the
bills
that
--
they
were
originally
introduced,
in
terms,
stated
that
they
were
exclusive
as
o
the
types
of
statement,
but
is
brought
back
from
the
conference
and
is
finally
passed,
wasn't
that
language
deleted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
how
do
you
explain
the
deletion
of
the
exclusivity
language
in
the
conference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
get
your
position
which
is
that
while
what
was
in
the
bill
is
the
reason
introduced,
the
deletion
had
a
very
indefinite
purpose
in
mind,
namely,
as
you
have
suggested,
to
make
clear
that,
on
pretrial,
nothing
was
produced.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
only
after
the
witness
had
testified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
davis,
if
the
judgment
is
generally
of
the
view
that
they
may
not
take
testimony
that,
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
the
responsibility
in
camera
to
decide
both
issues
of
relevancy
and
issues
of
substantially
verbatim
recital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
before
you
get
what
he'd
say,
that's
in
this
very
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
determined,
merely
form
the
examination
of
the
document,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
i
assume
that
it
must
have
done
this,
at
least.
and,
it
also
read
mr.
carlin's
testimony
and
decided
for
itself
whether
this
statement
was
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
the
things
he
testified
to
at
the
trial,
did
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
there
--
right
there,
three
years
after
the
event,
after
he
made
this
statement,
mr.
belavan
asserts
an
affidavit
that
“all
i
put
in
that
memorandum
was
a
general
summary
of
what
i
had
been
told.”
isn't
in
the
--
in
fact,
what
he
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
yet,
there
was
no
examination
or
cross-examination
of
that
statement.
there
was
no
testimony
of
any
kind
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
indicate
what
it
was,
in
fact,
carlin
had
said
to
belavan
on
the
occasion
of
the
interview
which
resulted
in
belavan's
preparation
of
the
memorandum,
was
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
how
can
the
court
of
appeals
accept
as
the
--
takes
his
bare
statement
that
all
that
that
memorandum
is,
is
a
bear
summary
of
what
the
witness
told
him.
how
can
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
here
be
sustained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
--
i'm
not
so
concerned
with
whether
this
is
done
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
for
the
purposes
of
this
question.
i
am
concerned
how
a
court,
by
itself,
is
to
reach
the
conclusion
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
without
having
any
examination
at
all
either
of
the
witness
whose
statement
to
the
investigator
the
investigator
purports
to
summarize.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
could
--
how
could
the
other
party
deny
it
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
let's
get
a
preliminary
to
clear
it
up,
if
you
will,
for
me.
how
would
they
know
what
to
do
about
this
statement
when
they
never
saw
it?
how
would
they
know
what
it
was
or
how
they
could
attack
it
or,
perhaps,
be
satisfied
that
they
shouldn't
attempt
to
attack
it
when
they
never
say
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
congress
adopted
that
as
to
the
--
expressly
on
the
issue
of
relevancy
to
put
it,
that
is,
where
the
government
says
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it's
irrelevant
material
on
the
statement,
the
government
concedes
that
parts
of
the
statement
should
be
turned
over
and
the
congress
has
said,
“well,
the
court
shall,
in
camera,
determine
whether
there
are
irrelevant
parts
and
turn
over
only
the
relevant
material.”
but,
has
the
congress
has
explicitly
stated
that
the
court
shall,
in
camera,
determine
whether
or
not
a
given
report
is
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
difficulty
--
you
might
have
told
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
davis,
the
--
among
these
authenticated
statements
is
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
--
you've
already
agreed
with
me
that,
whether
something
is
or
not,
it
might
be
a
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
might
be
controverted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
what
i
don't
quite
understand,
in
response
both
to
me
and
justice
frankfurter
is
why
you
suggest
this
should
be
the
--
and
in
camera,
determination
by
--
by
the
trial
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
he
may
see
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
that
--
that's
to
suggest
then,
at
the
level
of
trial
judge,
the
court
of
appeals
and,
i
gather,
also
in
this
court,
this
whole
determination
is
to
be
made,
the
determination
whether
it's
authenticated
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
substantially
verbatim
recital,
by
--
in
the
first
instance,
the
trial
judge,
he
decides
against
the
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
may
reach
the
same
conclusion
without
the
defendant
having
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
whether
it
is
or
isn't
substantial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
it?
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
opportunity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is,
by
and
large,
the
--
these
determinations
--
this
determination,
as
to
a
particular
statement,
whether
this
is
substantially
verbatim
recital,
is
to
be
made
without
hearing
the
defense
on
that
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
it's
to
be
made
in
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court.
and,
my
question
is
if
that's
the
fact,
isn't
there
a
constitutional
question
raised
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
mr.
davis,
you
said
if
that
--
something
appeared
that
the
witness
had
been
evasive
or
lying
or
such
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
statement
by
the
agent,
i
see.
well,
suppose,
in
this
very
case,
there
had
been
a
statement
by
the
agent,
“i
talked
with
carlin.
carlin
denied
having
any
knowledge
whatever
of
this
business.”
that's
all
that
the
statement
says.
and
then,
carlin
testifies
as
carlin
testified
at
the
trial.
would
that
statement
be
producible
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
the
examination
of
carlin
was
“did
you
have
an
interview
with
any
government
agent?”
“yes,
i
did.”
“what
did
you
say
at
that
interview?”
“i
don't
remember.”
and,
the
statement
is
the
one
that
i
have
suggested
to
you
that,
in
the
interview,
what
carlin
said
to
the
agent
was
“i
don't
know
a
thing
about
this
business,
never
heard
of
it,
and
had
no
connection
with
it
whatever.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
point
is
that
that
would
not
be
a
producible
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
in
my
mind
of
course
is,
and
perfectly
obviously,
that
would
be
an
extraordinarily
helpful
statement
to
the
defense
in
cross-examination
of
carlin,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
he
--
suppose
the
witness
had
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
the
agent
can't
be
found,
he's
dead
or
he
disappeared
that
he
can't
produce
it
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wait
now,
suppose
it
were,
suppose
it
were
to
happen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
statement
would
then
be
producible
notwithstanding
the
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
--
but,
as
i
understand
the
burden
of
the
government's
argument,
it
is
that
the
statute
defines
exclusively
the
types
of
statements
that
shall
be
produced
for
use
by
the
defense
in
cross-examination
of
a
government's
witness,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
there
are
exceptions
read
into
the
statute,
then
the
statute
is
not,
in
fact,
exclusive,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
another
hypothetical.
now,
suppose
you
were
--
had
a
prosecution
for
the
murder
of
a
federal
officer
and
the
witness
takes
the
stand
and
he
says
that
he
attended
a
meeting
at
which
the
defendant
and
others
were
present.
and,
at
that
meeting,
the
defendant
said
that
he
had
shot
and
killed
the
federal
officer,
and
he
also
says
that
he
reported
that
to
a
government
agent.
he
signed
nothing.
he
never
saw
any
memorandum
of
his
report,
and
the
reports
are
called
for
and
the
government
produces
a
report.
and,
the
report
--
the
memorandum,
rather,
of
the
report
is
that,
yes,
he'd
been
told
by
the
witness
that
there
was
such
a
meeting
and
that,
at
that
meeting,
the
defendant
was
present
and
there
were
others
also
present.
and,
that
the
statement
was
made
that
someone
had
shot
and
killed
the
federal
officer,
but
that
the
statement
was
made
not
by
the
defendant
but
by
someone
else
at
the
meeting.
would
that
report
qualify
him
in
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
just
want
to
get
it
clear
then.
it
is
not
the
government's
position
that
the
statute
is
necessarily
exclusive
as
to
the
types
of
statements
that
may
be
produced
and
used
by
the
defense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
that,
to
me,
mr.
davis,
that's
nothing
except
an
acknowledgment
full
of
semantics
there
that
you
will,
that
the
statute
was
not
exclusive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
this
gets
to
the
fact
to
allude
the
discussion
you
and
i
had
yesterday.
as
i
understand
the
statute,
as
i
read
it,
the
prohibition
against
showing
the
other
side
anything
deals
only
with
those
papers
which
the
government
hands
up
and
says
“this
includes
something
relevant
in
the
sense
that
it
bears
and
touches
upon
the
witness'
testimony,
but
it
also
includes
other
irrelevant
material.”
justice
william
j.

“and,
if
your
honor
please,
will
you
excise
the
irrelevant
material?”
but,
in
the
area
we're
now
discussing
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is,
whether
not
a
report
is
a
substantially
verbatim
recital,
certainly,
the
congress
did
not
expressly
provide
a
like
procedure
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
why,
then,
in
that
circumstance,
would
it
be
contrary
to
the
congressional
intention
to
construe
this
statute
dealing
with
the
type
of
statement
we
have
here,
where
the
issue
is
substantially
verbatim
recital
and
where,
as
i
think
the
government
would
concede,
there
is
no
question
of
government
secrets
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
voir
dire
that
--
in
your
discussion
with
mr.
justice
frankurter,
you
agreed
the
judge
in
the
proper
case
is
at
liberty
to
conduct.
why
could
not
the
judge
in
that
circumstance,
as
part
of
the
discretion
he
exercises
because
troubled,
whether
or
not
this
is
a
substantially
verbatim
recital,
say
to
defense
counsel
here
“you
look
out
it”?
would
there
be
anything
about
the
statute
which
would
prevent
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
them.
