chief

a
principal
counsel
or
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
she
take
a
lead
in
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
actual
test
of
what
you
said
in
this
meeting
is
not
in
the
record
but
a
dictated
brief,
in
my
recollection,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
what
is
the
(inaudible)

(inaudible)
findings
of

--
justice

assuming

supported
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
expressed
finding
that
the
leave
had
embarrassed
the
conduct
of
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
expressed
by
the
rules?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
that
isn't
the
question.
my
question
was
the
expression
was
or
wasn't
that
the
findings
of
the
fact
that
her
conduct
had
embarrassed
the
conduct
of
the
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
essence
of
the
trial
really
is
an
unprofessional
conduct
of
a
lawyer
throughout
talking
about
a
case
while
it,
perhaps,
progressed.
do
you
say
it
went
that
far?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
smith
act
trials
had
there
been
in
hawaii?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
the
only
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
jury
or
the
juror's
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
saying
is
if
there
is
a
general
understanding
with
the
bar
that
lawyers
don't
have
relations
with
jurors
during,
before
--
or
after
or
during
the
trial,
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
is
really
before
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
didn't
you
say,
as
certainly
i
understood
you,
on
the
trial
in
the
district
court,
you're
not
supposed
to
talk
about
the
cases,
in
public,
being
tried
in
the
courts?
