stewart
mr.
mcternan,
i
understood
you
say
that
your
claim
is
to
discipline
her
for
this
speech
violates
her
first
amendment
freedom.
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
claim
as
broad
as
that?
what
if
the
discipline
had
been
imposed
because
she
interfered
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice
by
getting
this
speech?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it's
not.
justice
potter
stewart
surely,
your
lawyer
can't
--
he's
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
is
he,
from
unfairly
and
improperly
and
unethically
trying
his
case
in
the
newspapers?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
--
i
know
the
issue
isn't
here
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
you
on
now?
justice
potter
stewart

justice
potter
stewart
bridges
and
--
the
bridges
and
the
pennekamp
cases
both
involved
contempt,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
involves
a
disciplinary
procedure
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
a
lawyer,
of
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
professional.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
was
he
--
was
this
lawyer
--
was
this
lawyer
charged
with
any
such
impropriety
as
that
as
--
as
interfering
with
the
fair
trial
that
was
going
on?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
barlow,
it
would
you
concede
that
apart
from
the
pendency
of
this
criminal
litigation,
the
smith
act's
trial,
apart
from
that,
apart
from
the
pendency
of
that,
wouldn't
you
--
wouldn't
you
agree
that
mrs.
sawyer,
under
the
first
amendment,
had
all
the
freedom
on
the
world
to
say
that
judges
were
engaging
in
a
witch-hunt?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
impugning
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
isn't
it?
that's
--
that's
just
ordinary
criticism
i
--
and
a
point
of
view
shared
by
a
good
many
people.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
or
not
it
is,
whether
it
was
her
sole
point
of
view,
doesn't
the
first
amendment
protect
her
in
saying
that?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
the
only
--
only
thing
you
pointed
out.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
i
don't
know
much
about
anything
about
the
geography
of
hawaii
--
the
--
of
our
new
state
except
that
it's
an
archipelago
and
consisted
of
several
islands.
the
trial
was
going
on
in
honolulu?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
speech
was
made
on
a
different
island.
justice
potter
stewart
180
miles
away.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
newspaper
report
of
the
speech,
the
contemporaneous
newspaper
report
was
published
in
honolulu
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
--
on
the
island
on
which
the
speech
was
given.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
this
meeting
of
which
this
speech
was
given
was
well
advertised
in
advance
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
reporter
say
why
he'd
gone
and
he'd
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
instructed
by
his
paper,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
showing
when
the
--
showing
of
facts
in
which
an
inference
could
be
drawn
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
knew
the
reporter
would
be
there
and
--
and
knew
and
have
reason
to
believe
that
there
would
be
a
reporter
of
this
in
the
--
in
the
newspapers?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
shown
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
showing
during
the
trial
that
the
members
of
the
--
of
the
jury
in
the
smith
act
case
had
seen
this
newspaper
article?
justice
potter
stewart
no
suggestion
along
those
lines
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
during
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
connection,
mr.
barlow
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
be
that
petitioners
--
it
seems
to
have
been
and
continue
to
be
the
petitioner's
position
throughout
these
proceedings
that
how
the
penalty
imposed
was
purportedly
a
suspension
of
practice
for
one
year,
in
actual
practical
effect,
it
was
disbarment.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
matter?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
presentation,
but
i
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
need
to
know.
justice
potter
stewart
and
somebody
suspended
for
more
than
six
months
has
to
do
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
and
presumably,
i
suppose
that
these
very
proceedings
would
make
it
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
pass
the
character
test
if
that
were
true.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
some
answer
on
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
not
here
today
characterizing
this
as
one
little
incident,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
like
any
due
applicant.
justice
potter
stewart
like
anyone
who
has
never
been
admitted
to
the
bar.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
labor
day
speech
was
made
before
there
was
any
trial,
a
couple
of
days
after
the
indictment
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
long
before
the
trial
in
this
case
was
ended?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
was
14
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
15
months
before,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
more
than
a
year
before.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
that
point
for
good,
is
--
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
it's
your
basic
position
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
a
lawyer
from
being
disciplined
for
unethical
conduct
even
thought
that
conduct
may
consist
in
--
simply
in
speech
which
is,
we
may
assume,
protected
speech
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
--
that
the
citizen
might
make
from
the
first
amendment
but
still,
that
that
does
not
protect
a
lawyer
from
disciplinary
proceedings
taken
to
discipline
him
in
his
professional
status.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
most
the
canons
or
many
of
them
are
worthless,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
if
that
--
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
unanimously
believe
or
a
majority
of
them
at
least
believe
that
if
the
second
count
alone
had
been
involved,
that
court
would
have
had
no
jurisdiction?
