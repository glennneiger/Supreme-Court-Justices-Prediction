mr.
a.
william
barlow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
mr.
mcternan
has
lost
over
the
evidence
very
lightly.
i
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
am
i
asking
you
to
overrule
it,
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
sir,
because
i
don't
think
it
hasn't
any
application
here.
i
subscribed
to
justice
frankfurter's
remarks
about
how
a
lawyer
should
conduct
himself
during
the
pendency
of
a
case
in
which
he
is
advocating
day
in
and
day
out
before
court.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
this
lawyer
was
charged,
may
it
please,
justice,
with
conducting
a
willful
and
oral
attack
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
a
federal
court.
she
was
charged
with
having
made
these
statements
and
she
was
also
charged
contrary
to
mr.
mcternan's
statement
to
the
court.
she
was
charged
with
impugning
the
integrity
of
the
court,
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
read
matsuoka's
notes,
if
the
court
will
read
the
story
that
appeared
in
the
newspaper,
the
court
will
come
to
the
conclusion
and
you
can't
come
into
any
other
conclusion
but
that
the
government
and
judge
wiig
were
conspiring
to
frame
the
clients
that
she
was
representing
in
a
courtroom.
she
started
out
her
what
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think
it
was
either
december
14th
or
15th.
but
it
was
on
a
sunday
morning.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
1952.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
charge
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think
it
was
either
a
year
or
two
later,
sir,
but
july
8,
1954
of
the
trial
in
which
she
was
engaged
at
the
time
had
not
terminated
until
june
of
1953.
and
subsequent
to
the
trial,
the
federal
judge
had
summoned
the
president
of
the
bar
association
and
asked
the
president
of
the
bar
association
to
look
in,
to
the
behavior
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
that
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
he
asked
the
president
of
the
bar
association.
the
record
so
indicates,
i
think,
with
mr.
sam
king
of
which
the
president
of
the
bar
association
at
the
time
and
judge
wiig
sent
for
the
president
of
bar
association
and
indicated
to
him
that
he
would
suggest
to
the
president
that
the
bar
association
investigate
the
behavior
of
mrs.
bouslog
during
the
fujimoto
trial.
and
at
that
time,
this
case
started.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
at
that
time,
the
bar
association
did
not
have
an
authority
under
the
then
existing
court
rules
to
file
a
complaint.
the
attorney
general
did
not
file
a
complaint
so
that
the
court
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
he
had
the
authority,
yes,
sir.
so
that
the
court
amended
its
rules
of
procedure
in
order
it
allow
the
bar
association
to
file
a
complaint.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sometimes
subsequent
to
the
termination
of
the
smith
act
which
was
in
june
of
1953.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
complaint
of
the
bar
association
is
filed
on
july
8th,
1954
and
the
hearings
had
sometime
in
november
and
december
of
1954.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
relevancy
of
the
pamphlet
in
the
back
of
the
brief
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no.
that
speech
was
made
two
days
after
the
indictment
was
returned
in
the
fujimoto
case.
and
we
offered
that
pamphlet
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
1951.
the
indictment
was
returned
sometime
in
august
of
1951.
and
two
or
three
days
after
that,
she
made
her
a
labor
day
speech
which
is
incorporated
into
the
pamphlet
here.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
court
took
in
a
consideration
of
fact
that
this
was
not
a
spontaneous
utterance
or
a
thought
that
probably
was
born
at
the
moment
that
she
was
making
her
speech
that
this
was
part
of
a
well-conceived
plan
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
yes,
sir,
that
pamphlet
was
in
evidence
before
the
hearing
committee,
it
was
in
evidence
before
the
supreme
court
and
it
was
in
evidence
before
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeal.
and
if
the
justices
will
read
that
pamphlet
carefully,
you'll
find
out
that
she
does
attack
judges.
she
makes
a
statement
in
there
to
the
effect
that
judges
to
stay
in
power,
join
in
the
witch-hunt.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
they
joined
in
the
witch-hunt.
she
had
referred
to
the
smith
act
trial
at
that
time
as
a
witch-hunter.
and
in
that
pamphlet,
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
that
speech
was
made,
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
a
lawyer
enters
his
appearance
on
a
certain
day
that
that
speech
also
was
made
during
the
pendency
of
this
course
of
action.
it
was
made
two
days
or
three
subsequent
to
the
return
of
the
indictment
and
it
was
made
subsequent
to
the
time
that
she
entered
her
name,
its
counsel
of
record
for
jack
hall
in
the
trial.
and
this
pamphlet
was
introduced
to
show
to
the
committee
and
also
showed
to
the
supreme
court
that
this
was
not
an
accident
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
that
this
was
a
well
devised
scheme,
it
was
a
well
devised
plan
whereby
she
was
going
around
making
speeches.
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
record,
the
record
will
indicate
that
jack
hall,
who
was
on
the
stand,
testifying
in
behalf
of
mrs.bouslog,
stated
that
after
she
made
this
honokaa
speech,
she
no
longer
was
part
of
the
speaking
entourage
for
the
ilwu.
now,
who
saw
the
light
of
day?
i
don't
know,
whether
she
did,
whether
the
ilwu
did,
we
have
no
information.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
oh
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i'm
sorry.
i
did
not
give
to
the
court
the
full
tender
of
her
speech
when
i
say
that
she
was
impugning
the
integrity
of
the
court.
as
i
see
your
question,
you
may
--
you
are
isolating
that
one
remark.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
and
i
--
i
had
not
intended
to
isolate
that
remark.
i
think
if
you
read
her
speech,
she
started
the
speech,
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
put
itself
in
the
climate,
the
atmosphere
where
this
speech
was
being
made.
the
speech
had
been
advertised
by
the
ilwu.
we're
going
to
have
a
public
discussion
on
sunday
morning
in
this
theater.
this
is
the
town
by
180
miles
from
oahu.
it
has
a
population
of
approximately
1000
people.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i'm
not
talking
about
that
speech,
no,
sir.
i'm
talking
about
the
speech
that
she
was
charged
with,
the
honokaa
speech.
she
was
advertised
as
one
of
the
principal
speakers.
she
came
over
there,
and
she
made
her
speech.
the
reporter's
notes
indicate
what
the
tender
of
her
speech
was,
to
be
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
started
out
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
trial
was
going
on
in
the
island
of
oahu
in
honolulu.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
made
on
the
island
of
hawaii
which
is
approximately
180
miles
over
international
waters.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
published
in
honolulu
and
it
was
also
published
in
the
hilo
herald-tribune
or
whatever
they
call
it.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
on
the
island
of
oahu.
and
subsequent
to
the
speech,
judge
wiig
summoned
mrs.
bouslog
and
the
colloquy
that
judge
bouslog
or
judge
wiig
and
mrs.
bouslog
had
is
part
of
the
record.
and
if
you
look
at
that
record,
you
will
indicate
that
mrs.
bouslog
stated
that
the
first
half
of
the
speech
was
devoted
to
a
general
discussion
of
smith
act
trials
and
that
the
second
half
of
her
speech
was
devoted
to
the
then
existing
trial
in
honolulu.
and
if
you
notice
further
in
the
colloquy,
judge
wiig
indicated
that
he
certainly
was
not
satisfied
with
the
right
explanation,
and
he
ordered
me
to
make
an
investigation
of
the
speech
to
find
out
whether
he
could
properly
charge
her
under
rule
42(b).
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
was
the
united
states
attorney
in
charge
of
the
case.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
he
could
not.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
and
i
also
looked
into
the
possibility
of
charging
her
under
title
18
section
401
and
because
of
the
court's
rulings
on
geographical
nearness,
we
could
not
charge
her
under
401
either
because
his
speech
had
been
made
180
miles
away.
and
because
of
those
factors,
judge
wiig
then
referred
this
matter
to
the
hawaii
bar
association.
and
hawaii
bar
association
referred
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court.
they
filed
a
complaint
against
her.
they
had
a
hiring.
and
i
might
say,
and
mr.
mcternan
talks
about
fragmentary
evidence,
prodding
of
witnesses,
leading
of
witnesses,
and
mrs.
bouslog
had
very
capable
counsel
during
the
secret
hearings.
mrs.
bouslog
counsel
was
afforded
at
all
times
the
opportunity
of
examination
and
cross-examination.
and
subsequent
to
the
finding
of
the
committee
and
subsequent
to
the
finding
by
the
--
subsequent
to
the
finding
of
the
committee,
mrs.
bouslog
was
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo.
if
she
wasn't
satisfied
with
the
fragmentary
evidence
that
was
developed
at
the
hearing
before
the
committee,
she
could
have
asked
for
a
trial
de
novo
before
the
supreme
court.
and
right
after
the
secret
hearings
had
ended,
mr.
anthony,
who
was
our
counsel
in
the
secret
hearings,
for
--
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
withdrew
and
that
was
present
counsel,
mr.
mcternan
who
had
the
opportunity
if
he
felt
that
the
evidence
was
fragmentary,
if
he
felt
that
there
was
any
deficiency
in
the
evidence,
he
had
the
opportunity
of
asking
the
supreme
court
for
trial
de
novo,
and
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
it
was
the
petitioner's
suggestion
that
the
matter
be
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
on
a
record
made
before
the
committee
in
which
the
bar
association
acquiesced.
we
had
no
desire
to
air
this
thing
in
public.
we
were
perfectly
willing
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
evidence
that
was
developed
at
the
hearing.
now
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
after
the
case
was
over?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
made
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
i
would
say,
that
she
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
i
think
that
if
a
lawyer
is
appearing
before
a
court,
advocating
certain
proposition,
she
shouldn't
go
out
at
night
telling
the
public
that
i
think
that
the
court
is
conspiring
with
the
government.
no
matter
what
we
produce
to
the
court,
we
can't
seem
to
get
in
to
the
evidence.
and
if
the
government
is
conspiring
with
the
federal
judge
in
order
to
widen,
in
order
to
give
the
government
more
latitude,
mr.
mcternan
puts
a
very
innocent
gloss
on
the
testimony.
and
the
testimony,
i
might
say,
is
not
restricted
to
matsuoka's
notes.it's
not
restricted
to
the
newspaper
report.
and
while
we
are
talking
about
matsuoka's
notes,
mr.
mcternan
refers
to
him
has
being
expanded.
the
reporter
was
asked
what
he
meant
by
his
expanded
notes,
and
the
reporter
said,
in
answer
to
the
committee
member
who
asked
him
the
question,
and
he
says,
“well,
do
your
name
is
dodge?
in
--
in
my
notes,
i
put
down
dodge.”
by
expanding
on
the
notes,
when
i
write
my
story,
i
say,
“robert
g.
dodge.”
that's
the
only
way
i
expand.
i
do
not
add
anything
to
it.
so
that
there
is
no
significance
in
mcternan's
statement
that
the
--
that
the
reporter
indicated
that
he
expanded
on
the
notes.
there
was
no
expansion
on
the
notes
insofar
as
changing
the
meaning.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
by
the
printer?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
i
honestly
can't
say
to
the
court
how
many
pages
the
notes
took.
the
notes
are
in
the
record,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
newspaper
article
in
and
of
itself
is
not
in
exhibit
but
it
is
recited
verbatim
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
court.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
and
according
to
matsuoka,
the
reporter
--
they
stated
that
the
meeting
was
advertised
in
advance.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
reporter
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
had
been
instructed
to
cover
the
meeting
because
they
felt
that
something
interesting
might
develop.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
i'll
answer
it
this
way,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
petitioner
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
reporter
present.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think
it
is.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
a
public
meeting.
it
was
advertised
in
the
public
meeting.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
it
was
advertised
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
advertised
in
a
little
town
of
1000
people.
it's
a
small
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
not
advertised
in
the
city
of
honolulu.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
show
that
anyone
of
the
jurors
had
seen
the
article
or
read
it
or
that
they
had
been
influenced
by
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
a
meeting
sponsored
by
the
defense
committee
which
was
collecting
money
or
had
already
collected
money
to
deprave
the
cost
of
expenses
of
smith
act
trial
especially
the
one
that
was
been
in
progress
in
honolulu.
and
she
was
making
a
report
to
the
people
that
had,
no
doubt,
contributed.
and
when
she
was
making
a
report,
they
had
contributed
to
the
defense
of
jack
hall
who
was
their
original
ilwu
director,
and
i
am
certain
they
were
not
in
to
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
he
was
regional
director
for
the
ilwu.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
international
longshoremen's
and
warehousemen's
union.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that
was
the
defense
committee,
jack
hall
being
part
of
the
ilwu.
they
banded
together
and
paid
his
legal
expenses.
and
this
was
the
committee
that
was
--
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
she
was
his
counsel
at
the
time.
she
was
his
counsel
of
record.
he
was
there,
and
she
was
there,
and
they
both
made
speech
as
critical
of
the
typed
evidence
that
was
being
introduced.
and
i
think
that
the
court
--
all
the
court
has
to
do
is
look
at
matsuoka's
notes,
and
the
court
can
easily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
mrs.
bouslog
had
banded
the
government
into
one
little
group,
the
government
being
the
federal
judge,
the
prosecutors,
the
fbi.
everybody
was
part
of
the
government
in
a
role
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
do
no
good
for
her
clients.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
some
of
the
court
may
be
wondering
why
a
speech
that
was
made
in
1952
is
before
the
court
in
1959.
i
may
be
facetious,
yet,
i
am
sincere
when
i
say
that
the
reason
for
the
long
delay
is
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
been
accorded
due
process
all
the
way
along
the
line.
in
1952,
december
14,
she
made
this
talk
at
honokaa
on
the
island
of
hawaii.
the
case
in
which
she
was
engaged
as
counsel
terminated
sometime
in
june
of
1953.
subsequent
to
the
termination
of
the
trial,
federal
judge
john
wiig,
who
presided
at
the
trial,
referred
the
behavior
of
the
petitioner
to
the
bar
association.
the
matter
was
then
referred
to
the
ethics
committee
in
july
of
1954.
in
september
of
1954,
the
petitioner
requested
a
bill
of
particulars,
which,
were
supplied
to
her.
in
november
of
1954,
the
ethics
committee
conducted
a
full-scale
hearing.
at
which
time,
the
petitioner
was
represented
by
a
very
able
counsel
and
at
which
time,
she
had
the
opportunity
of
presenting
on
her
behalf
any
and
all
witnesses
that
she
thought
were
people
who
could
testify
to
what
she
had
said
at
the
time
of
the
incident
related
to
in
the
complaint.
the
hearing
consumed
468
pages
and
ended
on
december
the
8th,
1954.
the
ethics
committee
report
which
found
mrs.
bouslog
guilty
of
impugning
the
integrity
of
the
court,
of
interfering
with
the
administration
of
justice,
and
creating
disrespect
for
the
courts
on
the
first
complaint,
and
on
the
second
complaint,
with
conducting
a
studied
interrogation
of
a
sick
juror
immediately
after
the
trial
in
violation
of
canon
23,
the
american
bar
association
opinion
109,
and
the
rulings
in
the
rakes
and
millie
cases.
subsequent
to
that
report
by
the
bar
association
ethics
committee,
the
supreme
court
issued
an
order
to
show
cause.
that
order
was
issued
july
8th,
1955.
the
petitioner
was
granted
an
extension
of
time
to
september
of
1955,
within
which,
to
file
an
answer.
instead
of
the
return
of
the
order
to
show
cause,
she
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
order
to
show
cause
on
october
19,
1955.
more
time
for
filing
petitioner's
return
to
the
order
to
show
cause
was
requested
and
petitioner
was
granted
to
december.
and
finally,
the
argument
was
set
for
january
of
1956.
on
january
7th,
1955,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration
of
the
order,
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
order
to
show
cause.
this
motion
was
extensively
argued
and
denied
by
order
filed
november
29,
1955.
a
return
to
the
order
to
show
cause
was
finally
filed
by
the
petitioner
on
december
2,
1955.
another
motion
for
continuance
by
petitioner
followed,
and
another
hearing
was
held.on
a
date
set
for
trial,
which
was
january
9,
1956,
a
pretrial
conference
was
held
with
counsel
for
the
bar
association,
counsel
for
the
attorney
general
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner
being
present.
two
days
later,
another
delay
was
occasioned
by
the
petitioner
filing
a
suggestion
of
disqualification
of
associate
justices
stainback
and
rice
of
the
supreme
court.
extensive
argument
on
this
motion
was
again
held
by
the
territorial
supreme
court.
the
territorial
supreme
court,
incidentally,
held
that
neither
justice
was
disqualified.
however,
justice
stainback
withdrew
on
his
own
motion.
at
the
pretrial
conference,
it
was
determined
that
under
rule
19,
the
petitioner
could
avail
herself
of
a
trial
de
novo.
however,
the
petitioner,
through
her
counsel,
and
counsel
for
the
bar
association,
and
the
attorney
general,
and
the
court
stipulated
that
instead
of
a
trial
de
novo,
the
matter
would
proceed
upon
a
record
submitted
before
the
committee.
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
filed
april
6,
1956.
the
court
found
that
the
complaint
was
sustained
by
convincing
proof,
by
credible
evidence
of
more
than
a
mere
preponderance.
the
court
found
that
the
charges
under
both
complaints
were
proven
and
found
that
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
gross
misconduct
on
both
counts.
the
petitioner
then
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
under
section
1293,
alleging
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question
involved
and
also
alleging
that
her
right
to
practice
law
had
a
money
tag
or
a
value
attached
to
it
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
she
was
suspended
for
one
year,
the
matter
in
controversy
or
the
value
in
controversy
was
the
amount
of
money
that
she
had
earned
in
previous
years.
the
bar
association
took
the
position
that
this
was
a
simple
matter
of
discipline
involving
the
canons
of
ethics,
that
there
was
no
first
amendment
constitutional
question
involved.
the
bar
association
took
the
position
that
insofar
as
the
license
to
practice
law
was
concerned,
it
was
priceless
and
you
could
not
attach
a
price
tag
to
it.
the
petitioner
filed
her
affidavit,
stating
that
she
made
an
excess
of
$5000
and
the
court,
on
the
first
hearing,
granted
her
a
stay
pending
the
determination
of
the
case
on
its
merits.
two
justices
justice
concurring,
and
justice
lemmon
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
indicated
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
that
it
was
a
very
simple
disciplinary
matter.
there
was
no
constitutional
question
involved
and
that
insofar
as
he
was
concerned,
you
could
not
attach
a
price
tag
to
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
yes,
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
under
our
rules
that
if
you
are
suspended
for
a
period
in
excess
of
six
months,
that
you
then
have
to
take
a
written
examination
and
you
again
have
to
pass
a
character
test.
we,
in
the
territory
of
hawaii,
at
the
present
time,
have
no
reciprocity
with
any
other
state
insofar
as
admission
by
a
motion
is
concerned.
when
i
went
there,
13,
14
years
ago,
i
had
to
take
a
bar
examination
that
lasted
five
days.
i
had
to
pass
a
character
test.
so
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
don't
know
why,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
depends
on
what
the
--
possibly,
if
it
ever
came
back
into
the
supreme
court,
it's
what
this
court
would
consider
good
moral
character.
maybe
our
court
might
decide
that
based
on
these
proceedings,
she
doesn't
possess
good
moral
character.
it
may
very
well
be
that
this
court
on
review,
as
they
did
in
the
schwerin
and
cunningsburgh
case,
stated
“in
our
opinion,
your
finding
is
arbitrary.
you're
dogmatic,
and
we
think
that
this
one
little
incident
doesn't
--
shouldn't
deprive
the
present
from
her
right
to
practice
law.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
sir.
now,
insofar
as
the
bar
association
of
the
territory
of
hawaii
is
concerned,
we
consider
this
a
very
serious
breach
of
the
canons
of
ethics
and
that's
all
we
do
consider,
as
a
breach
of
the
canons
of
ethics.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
supreme
court
itself,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
one
member
of
the
court
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
felt
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it's
very
possible,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
of
course,
the
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
may
very
well
be,
sir,
but
the
possibility
arises
at
something,
maybe
the
young
lady
could
never
pass
a
written
test
again,
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
may
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
they
could
say
that
“it's
up
to
you
to
carry
the
ball,”
so
to
speak,
“to
prove
to
us
that
you're
a
person
of
good
moral
character”
but
as
justice
frankfurter
indicates,
that
they
suspended
her
for
a
year.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
might
say
for
the
court's
benefit
that
as
soon
as
we
become
a
state,
we'll
have
a
new
supreme
court
and
the
people
that
participated
in
this
proceeding
more
likely
will
not
be
members
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
because
of
age
considerations.
under
our
constitution,
there's
an
age
limitation
and
two
of
the
judges
would
be
automatically
disqualified
because
of
age.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
that's
right,
sir.
the
only
rule
we
have
is
that
a
person
who
has
been
suspended
for
a
period
in
excess
of
six
months
must
satisfy
the
character
qualifications
and
take
a
written
test,
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
the
same
as
she
was
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
the
same
as
if
you
were
applying
for
admission
de
novo.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
same
examination,
sir.
it
isn't
a
special
examination.
you
take
the
same
examination
that
a
law
student
takes.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
has
not.
there
is
a
stay
order
that
was
issued
by
the
ninth
circuit
court,
so
that
she
has
been
practicing
and
carrying
on
her
profession
since
the
hearings.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
five
judges,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
three.
when
--
when
we
got
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
contended,
initially,
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
accept
this
case
under
title
28
section
1293.
the
court
ruled
against
us
two-to-one,
justice
lennon
dissenting.
then,
the
matter
was
set
down
for
a
hearing,
a
full-scale
hearing,
before
another
three-man
panel.
we
argued
the
case,
we
argued
the
merits
of
the
case
before
this
panel,
and
the
panel
never
came
up
with
a
decision.
either
by
hearsay
or
through
the
grapevine,
we
found
out
that
that
panel
did
not
agree
with
the
first
panel.
insofar
as
jurisdiction
was
concerned,
they
felt
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
so
they
set
the
matter
down
for
a
full-
scale
hearing
before
a
nine-man
court.
and
we
then
argued
the
matter
before
a
nine-man
court.
the
opinion
reflects
seven
members
four-for,
and
three-against.
justice
denman,
who
was
the
chief
justice
at
that
time,
retired
after
the
case
was
argued
and
justice
lemmon
died,
leaving
seven
judges
to
participate.
that
court
found
that
the
bar
association
had
sustained
its
burden.
that
court
found
that
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
the
conduct
that
was
charged
in
the
complaint.
that
court
indicated
in
its
decision
that
they
thought
that
they
held
jurisdiction
by
the
very
narrowest
of
threads
insofar
as
the
first
count
of
the
complaint
involving
her
claim
of
freedom
of
speech
was
concerned.
insofar
as
count
2,
involving
the
incident
with
the
juror
pool
was
concerned,
they
indicated
that
if
we
weren't
--
if
the
petitioner
wasn't
in
court
on
count
1,
she
certainly
wouldn't
be
in
court
on
count
2.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
ninth
circuit
court
did
so
find,
sir,
the
majority
opinion,
that
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
that
the
burden
was
sustained
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
she
did
attack
the
integrity
of
the
judge.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
sir.
there
was
no
finding
that
in
fact,
her
conduct
had
embarrassed
the
court
or
the
trial.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
there
was
a
finding
of
guilty
insofar
as
the
defendants
were
concerned
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
at
the
trial,
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
would
say
it
went
that
far
because
the
majority
opinion
by
justice
chambers
says
that
it
is
a
serious
violation
and
a
breach
to
the
canons
of
ethics
for
a
lawyer
to
litigate
by
day
and
castigate
by
night.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
publicly,
that's
right.
and
as
the
court
will
be
familiarized
with
the
tone
and
tenor
of
her
remarks,
as
reflected
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
in
that
speech
entitled
“fear,”
which
she
made
two
days
or
three
days,
i
think
the
indictment
was
returned
on
august
29th
or
28th,
1951.
the
day
following
that
she
and
mr.
symonds
entered
their
names
as
attorney
of
record,
and
two
days
later,
on
labor
day,
or
three
days
later,
she
made
that
speech
that
is
appended
to
our
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
brief.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
one,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
this
was
the
only
one.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
the
trial
actually
started
the
day
after
election
in
1952.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
so,
this
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
this
was
made
approximately
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
14
months
before.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
a
pattern.
the
reason
that
we
introduced
the
pamphlet
“fear”
and
some
of
the
other
speeches
that
she
had
made
was
to
show
the
committee
and
the
court
that
this
was
not
a
spontaneous
exclamation
or
a
spontaneous
suggestion
on
her
part,
that
it
was
part
of
a
program,
part
of
a
plan
and
design
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
judges
and
discredit
upon
the
courts
and
to
show
the
community
in
which
she
resided
that
smith
act
trials
were,
in
effect,
a
conspiracy.
if
the
court
will
read
very
carefully
the
notes,
matsuoka's
notes,
the
thoughts
contained
in
matsuoka's
notes,
the
testimony
of
all
the
witnesses
that
testified
at
the
hearing,
i
think
the
court
can
very
easily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
preaching
to
the
community
at
large
that
the
government
and
the
court
were
conspiring.
she
talked
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
during
the
litigation,
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
not
insofar
as
the
fear
pamphlet
is
concerned,
sir.
but
when
you
take
that
speech,
you
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
not
a
spontaneous
declaration
on
her
part,
that
she
knew
what
she
was
talking
about,
that
she
wasn't
excited
or
agitated
or
probably,
for
that
moment,
mad
about
something,
that
this
was
part
of
a
program
and
whether
the
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
yes.
i
know
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
against
the
smith
act
and
i
think
that
you
can
be
legitimately
against
anything
under
our
constitution.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
you
can
say
it
if
you
--
if
you
aren't?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
if
you
are,
you
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
under
the
first
amendment,
you
can
express
yourself
insofar
as
the
smith
act
is
concerned,
but
that's
not
our
problem
here.
our
problem
here
is
that
she
not
only
held
these
views,
but
expressed
them
during
the
pendency
of
a
case
in
which
she
was
one
of
the
very
active
counsels.
and
if
the
court
will
read
the
colloquy
between
judge
wiig
and
a
petitioner,
the
court
will
find
out
that
the
petitioner,
apparently,
was
a
little
aggravated
because
the
judge
was
allowing
certain
kinds
of
testimony
into
the
record
because
when
the
judge
asked
her,
“did
you
make
the
statement
that
rather,
horrible
and
shocking
things
go
on
in
this
trial?”
she
said,
and
this
is
only
two
days
later,
“i
have
no
recollection
of
making
that
statement,”
she
says,
“but
i
want
it
clearly
understood.”
and
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
29
of
the
record.
this
is
exhibit
a,
the
colloquy
between
a
petitioner
and
judge
wiig.
“as
the
court
can
see,
my
remarks
were
directly
toward
the
conduct
of
the
prosecution
and
were
not
directed
toward
the
court.”
and
this
is
the
part
that
i
want
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to,
“by
that
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
defense
counsel,
in
any
way,
received
from
the
position
that
was
taken
in
the
brief
filed
in
connection
with
the
crouch's
testimony
in
which
we
believe
we
have
cited
authorities
showing
that
your
honor
has
admitted
evidence
which
is
not
admissible
even
in
ordinary
conspiracy
cases.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it
except
that
it
corroborates
matsuoka's
notes,
it
corroborates
the
witness'
testimony
that
she
did
say
that
the
government
and
the
court
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
whereby
they
were
widening
the
rules
of
evidence,
whereby
the
rules
of
evidence
were
being
scrapped
so
that
the
government
could
make
out
a
case.
and
in
one
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
the
complaint
is
in
what
she
said.
she
did
not,
in
so
many
words,
or
she
did
not
use
the
word
“conspiracy”.
she
did
not
say
that
the
government
conspired
with
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
that's
my
own
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
my
own
language.
i
am
not
quoting
from
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
she
did
not
say
it
at
anytime,
using
the
word
“conspiracy,”
but
i
think
that
when
you
read
the
speech
as
a
whole,
you
can
rationally
infer
that
she
was
alleging
a
conspiracy
between
the
government
and
the
judge
in
widening
the
rules
of
evidence
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
in
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
under
the
canons
of
ethics,
i
would
say
she
had
violated
canon
1,
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
aggravates
the
situation
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
she
was
counsel
in
the
pending
case.
when
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
when
a
lawyer
gets
up
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
a
law
review
article
that
makes
the
same
charges.
if
the
writer
of
the
law
review
article
imputes
a
dishonest
motive
to
the
judge
but
the
judge
is
scrapping
all
rules
of
evidence,
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
that
he
is
allowing
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
there's
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think
that
this
court
is
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
yes.
i
think
that
this
court
is
subject
to
criticism.
frankly,
i
have
criticized
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
i'm
not
here
litigating
today
and
last
night,
i
wasn't
out
making
a
speech
criticizing
this
court
for
the
shocking
and
horrible
things
that
go
on
in
here.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think,
frankly,
that
i
would
be
subject
to
censure
if
i
showed
disrespect
to
this
court
and
that's
all
we're
claiming,
that
she
was
disrespectful
to
the
court
under
canon
1.
i
mean,
what
do
you
have
to
do
to
be
disrespectful
to
a
court?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
she's
merely
being
deprived
temporarily.
if
the
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
if
the
canons
of
ethics
are
going
to
be
nullified,
in
effect,
by
allowing
people
to
go
out
during
the
course
of
a
trial
and
accuse
a
presiding
trial
judge
of
getting
together,
so
to
speak,
with
the
prosecution
so
that
the
prosecution
can
allow
or
put
in
all
kinds
of
testimony,
then,
i
think
that
the
canons
of
ethics
are
worthless.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
canons
of
ethics
have
been
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
territory
of
hawaii.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
there's
no
statute.
it's
merely
by
rule
of
the
court.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
not
necessarily,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
not
that
i
know
of,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
not
that
i
know,
sir.
no
one
is
taking
away
anybody's
living
here,
sir.
they're
suspending
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
your
license
for
one
year.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
if
we're
being
practical,
if
she
is
suspended
for
a
year,
she
losses
whatever
earning
capacity
she
has
for
that
year.
i
don't
deny
or
dispute
that
but
there's
big
--
one
bigger
question
here,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
there's
one
in
answer
to
this
question
and
that
is
whether
a
lawyer
is
engaged
in
a
business,
or
whether
we're
engaged
in
a
profession,
and
whether
we,
as
lawyers,
are
bound
by
standards
that
are
a
little
higher
than
a
businessman.
the
petitioner
makes
the
statement
in
this
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
reply
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
i
think
lawyers
are
entitled
to
as
much,
if
not
more,
protection
than
ordinary
citizens.
but
i
certainly
think
that
a
lawyer's
conduct
should
be
guided
by
a
higher
formula,
a
higher
degree,
or
a
higher
standard
than
an
ordinary
citizen.
and
if
a
lawyer
is
not
supposed
to
be
guided
by
a
different
standard
than
an
ordinary
businessman,
then
i
say
that
the
supreme
court
should
say,
in
effect,
that
“insofar
as
the
canons
of
ethics
are
concerned,
disregard
them.”
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think
so,
sir.
i
think
that
i've
covered
the
speech
incident
sufficiently.
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
our
brief,
we
have
tried
to
itemize
and
corroborate
each
one
of
the
statements
that
was
made
by
matsuoka
in
his
notes.
and
before
i
get
off
that
subject,
i
would
just
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
it
isn't
only
matsuoka's
notes
that
is
part
of
this
record.
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
record,
the
court
will
find
out
that
matsuoka
was
put
under
oath
and
he
testified
for
17
pages,
and
petitioner's
counsel
cross-examined
him
extensively
and
intensely.
and
matsuoka
testified
under
oath
to
many
of
the
statements
that
are
found
in
his
notes
and
in
a
newspaper
article.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
if
it
does,
then
canon
1
is
worthless.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
that's
what
i
--
that's
why
i
say
that
if
you
hold
that
a
lawyer
is
to
be
measured
by
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
that
judge
pope
advocates,
then
you
might
just
as
well
scrap
the
canons
of
ethics.
and
frankly,
i
have
been
operating
under
the
canons
of
ethics
for
a
long
time
and
if
the
supreme
court
feels
that
they
are
worthy
of
being
scrapped,
i
would
like
to
be
so
advised
because
i'd
like
to
get
in
there
and
meet
my
competition.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
if
you're
scrapping
the
first
canon
of
ethics,
i
think
that
you're
scrapping
one
of
the
most
important
of
all
the
canons
of
ethics
which
requires
a
lawyer
to
show
a
little
respect
for
the
court
in
which
he
is
advocating.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it's
our
contention
that
petitioner
violated
canon
23,
opinion
109
of
the
american
bar
association,
violated
the
rakes
and
millie
rulings.
after
the
verdict,
mrs.
bouslog
got
a
telephone
call
on
a
friday
night
from
a
woman
who
was
the
sister
of
the
sick
juror.
this
woman
was
a
member
of
the
ilwu.
she
called
mrs.
bouslog
and
said,
“my
brother
is
sick.”
mrs.
bouslog
said,
“is
he
a
member
of
the
ilwu?”
or
something
to
that
effect.
she
is
--
she
indicated
he
was.
so,
she
says,
“i'll
be
right
down.”
she
went
down
and
she
found
the
juror
to
be
in
a
very
weakened
position.
i
think
her
affidavit
indicates
that
he
was
motionless,
that
he
certainly
was
too
sick
to
be
talked
to
at
that
time.
she
talked
to
the
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
i
have
not,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
am
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
i
was
coming
to
that
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
mrs.
bouslog
is
the
attorney
for
the
ilwu.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
am
practically
quoting
the
record
verbatim,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
mrs.
cabreros
who
is
the
sister
of
the
juror,
fuller,
called
mrs.
bouslog
who
is
the
attorney
for
the
ilwu.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
and
she
said
to
mrs.
bouslog,
“my
brother
david,
who
was
the
juror,
is
sick.”
mr.
a.
william
barlow
and
mrs.
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
mrs.
cabreros?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
she
indicated
in
her
conversation
that
he
wanted
to
see
her.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
and
she
indicated
that
she
had
told
mrs.
bouslog
that
her
brother
was
yelling,
“frame
up!”
mr.
a.
william
barlow
was
yelling
“frame
up!”
f-r-a-m-e
-u-p,
frame
up.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
yelling
“frame
up,”
the
fact
that
he
was
sick,
she
went
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
don't
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
is
sir,
i
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
if
the
court
wants
me
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
to,
i
can
read
the
record
for
the
court.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
alright,
sir.
the
--
anyway,
mrs.
cabreros
indicated
to
mrs.
bouslog
that
her
brother
wanted
to
see
her.
mrs.
bouslog
came
down,
she
found
the
brother
sick
in
bed.
she
did
not
interview
the
juror
on
that
occasion.
she
came
back
the
following
day
and
conducted
a
very
searching
examination,
an
inquiry
of
the
juror
as
to
what
transpired
in
the
jury
room.
and
i
think
that
our
brief
shows
that
the
juror,
presumably,
related
30
different
incidents
that
occurred
in
the
jury
room
and
she
submitted
that
affidavit
to
judge
wiig
in
an
attempt
to
impeach
the
verdict.
the
judge,
as
i
recall
the
situation,
did
not
have
a
hearing
on
that
affidavit,
but
the
bar
association
charged
her
with
this
violation
of
conducting
a
studied
interrogation
of
the
juror
fuller.
and
the
evidence
before
the
court
in
the
record
will
indicate
that
mrs.
fuller
had
made
many
of
the
statements
to
mrs.
bouslog,
that
mrs.
bouslog
did
not
advise
judge
wiig
of
the
exact
physical
condition
or
mental
condition
of
the
juror,
that
she
related
to
judge
wiig
the
conversation
that
she
allegedly
had
with
the
juror,
and
the
many
things
that
the
juror
told
her
occurred
in
the
jury
room.
and
the
--
mrs.
bouslog
did
not
tell
the
judge
in
her
affidavit
that
the
juror
fuller
was
too
sick
to
sign
an
affidavit.
she
did
not
tell
the
judge
that
she
tried
to
get
the
wife,
mrs.
fuller,
to
sign
an
affidavit
but
mrs.
fuller
said,
“i
won't
sign
that
affidavit
because
what
you
have
in
that
affidavit
is
not
what
my
husband
said.”
so,
mrs.
bouslog
decided
to
sign
the
affidavit
instead.
and
the
court
has
before
it
the
record
of
the
doctor
that
treated
the
juror.
the
court
has
before
it
the
record
of
the
psychiatrist
that
treated
the
juror.
and
we
feel
that
under
all
the
circumstances,
that
studied
interrogation
violated
canon
23
and
it
violated
the
holdings
in
the
millie
and
rakes
cases.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
depended
on
what
she
went
out
to
seem
him
for.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
canon
3
says
--
or
23
says
that
a
lawyer
should
never
communicate
with
a
juror,
that's
before
or
after
and
during
the
course
of
a
trial.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
it's
possibly
so
and
if
the
court
feels
that
you
can
interrogate
a
juror
after
verdict,
why,
i'm
sure
that
there
are
lots
of
us
lawyers
who
adhere
to
the
canons
and
don't
interrogate
jurors.
we
would
like
to
know
because
we'd
like
to
get
to
the
jurors
too
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
to
find
out
what
they're
thinking
about.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
there
is
no
statute
against
interrogating
a
juror,
sir,
except
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
has
laid
down
a
rule
in
the
millie
case
which
indicates
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
canons
of
ethics
to
interrogate
jurors,
to
--
to
conduct
a
studied
interrogation
of
jurors
after
verdict.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well
it's
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
second
charge
is
based
on
a
fact
that
she
conducted
a
studied
interrogation
of
a
juror.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
witness
hall
indicates
that
we
would
develop
the
subject.
we
would
ask
him
questions,
he
would
answer.
she
would
ask
a
question,
i
would
ask
a
question,
and
he
would
answer.
we
would
develop
a
subject
then
go
onto
another
subject.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
the
ninth
circuit
court,
may
it
please
justice
black,
has
decided
in
the
millie
case
that
it's
unethical
and
it's
not
proper
for
a
lawyer
to
conduct
a
studied
investigation
or
interrogation
of
a
juror
after
a
trial.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i'm
not
sure
that
i
am
quoting
the
exact
words
but
that's
the
import
of
the
ruling
and
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
under
certain
circumstances,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
he
is
not
supposed
to
conduct
an
investigation
of
a
juror
subsequent
to
a
verdict.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
i
mean
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
that's
too
simple
for
some
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
lawyers
to
do.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
said
that's
too
simple
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
for
some
lawyers
to
do.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
judge
is
available
for
that
purpose.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
it's
--
we
have
it
in
our
brief,
sir,
in
the
millie
case
and
in
the
rakes
case.
one
is
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
other
is
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
those
two
cases,
plus,
canon
23.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
i
think,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
evidence,
you'll
find
out
how
and
who
asked
to
see
what
lawyer
in
this
particular
case.
it
isn't
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
was
relevant
to
the
charge
in
this
respect,
that
when
they
asked
us
for
a
bill
of
particulars
as
to
whether
the
affidavit
was
true
or
false,
we
stated
that
we
did
not
make
any
statement
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
affidavit.
all
we
say
is
that
the
affidavit,
its
contents,
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
secured
violate
the
canons
of
ethics.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
they
had
before
it
that
--
those
facts
and
they
deemed
it
very
relevant
to
the
findings
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
can't
point
out
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
that
that
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
by,
that
i
don't
understand
what
justice
black
that
if
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
when
you
say
“that,”
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
what
do
you
mean
by
“that?”
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
court
made
no
finding
that
there
was
a
false
affidavit.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
and
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
they
made
no
finding
on
that
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
they
didn't
charge
her
on
that.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
and
i
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right
and
i
did
not
so
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
did
not
make
any
statement
to
justice
frankfurter
that
the
affidavit
contained
a
false
one.
i
say
that
the
court
can
easily,
after
it
reads
the
evidence
and
evaluates
the
evidence,
come
to
the
conclusion
that
perhaps,
the
affidavit
didn't
state
facts.
and
my
answer
to
justice
frankfurter
was
that
mrs.
fuller
stated
to
mrs.
bouslog
that
“i
will
not
sign
this
affidavit
because
this
affidavit
does
not
contain
the
facts
as
they
are.”
mr.
a.
william
barlow
we
did
not
charge
her
with
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
there's
a
finding
by
the
bar
committee
to
that
effect.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
rather
than
take
the
time
of
the
court,
i
would
like
permission
to
--
“with
respect
to
the
charges
in
paragraph
3,
the
committee
finds
that
when”
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
page
15
of
the
record,
sir.
“with
respect
to
the
charges
in
paragraph
3,
the
committee
finds
that
after
rendition
of
the
verdict
in
criminal
10
corps
95
mentioned
above
mrs.
bouslog
visited
one
of
the
jurors,
david
p.
fuller,
jr.
while
he
was
in
a
very
poor
mental
and
physical
condition,
and
thereafter,
submitted
her
affidavit
concerning
an
interview
with
the
juror
to
the
presiding
judge.
while
the
affidavit
of
mrs.
bouslog
indicates
that
on
the
first
occasion,
he
was
gravely
ill,
the
committee
finds
that
she
did
not
fully
disclose
to
the
court
the
condition
of
mr.
fuller,
nor
the
fact
that
she
had
attempted
to
get
affidavits
from
mrs.
fuller
who
refused
to
sign
one
and
could
not
get
an
affidavit
from
mr.
fuller
because
of
his
condition.”
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
it
doesn't
say
it's
false.
i
didn't
say
it
was
false
either.
i
said
that
the
testimony
of
mrs.
fuller
indicated
that
mrs.
fuller
made
the
statement
that
the
matters
contained
in
the
affidavit
weren't
factual.
that's
all
i
said.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
you
can
very
easily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
is
a
false
affidavit.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that
is
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
it
is
in
the
record,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
she
signed
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
the
affidavit
herself.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
is
the
court
asking
me
for
my
personal
opinion?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
i
think
that
the
court
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
a
false
affidavit.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
point
was
never
decided
by
any
court
below,
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
when
mrs.
fuller
refused
to
sign
the
affidavit,
then
mrs.
bouslog
made
an
affidavit.
now,
whether
it
was
the
same
affidavit,
the
same
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
she
never
did.
she
never
signed
the
affidavit
because
she
said,
under
oath,
that
it
contained
matters
that
were
not
factual.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
you
mean
if
you
take
it
alone,
isolate
it?
no.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
sir,
that's
only
part
of
this
whole
problem.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
one
facet.
that
is
not
the
reason
why
the
court
voted
suspension,
and
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
insofar
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
territory
of
hawaii
was
concerned,
they
did
not
impose
any
punishment
on
the
second
count
because
they
felt
that
their
one-year
suspension
on
the
first
count
was
adequate,
so
that
she
was
not
given
any
suspension
for
the
second
count.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
frankly,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
i
subscribe
very
heartily
to
justice
lennon's
opinion
and
decision
and
i
don't
think
that
this
case
should
be
here.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
as
a
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
decided
that
she
was
guilty
on
two
counts.
it
isn't
very
artfully
set
out
by
the
supreme
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petitioner
herself
did
not
bring
the
matter
up
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit
court.
they
took
it
upon
themselves
to
look
into
the
matter
and
write
the
opinion
that
they
did.
the
only
thing
that
the
petitioner
went
up
to
the
ninth
circuit
on
was
the
first
count
involving
the
speech.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
yes,
sir?
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
the
court
said
that
“we
feel
that
the
year's
suspension
is
sufficient
and
we
will
not
impose
an
additional
punishment
on
the
second
count,”
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
no,
i
indicated
that
justice
lemmon,
at
the
very
first
hearing,
indicated
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
matter
for
two
reasons.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
he
said
that
there
was
no
constitutional
question
involved.
secondly,
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
the
monetary
amount
that
the
license
to
practice
--
mr.
a.
william
barlow
--
had
no
price
tag.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
well,
she
got
no
punishment
for
the
second
charge.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
if
she
got
a
punishment
for
the
second
charge,
i
would
say
that
is
was
not
reviewable
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
i
don't
think
that
the
right
to
practice
law
carries
with
it
a
price
tag.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
not
the
sentence,
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
there's
nothing
before
the
court
on
that
because
there's
no
sentence.
mr.
a.
william
barlow
that's
right.
she
was
found
guilty
of
gross
misconduct
on
the
two
charges.
