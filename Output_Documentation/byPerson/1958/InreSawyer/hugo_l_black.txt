i
ask
if
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
the
bridges
and
pennekamp
cases?t
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
date
of
the
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
date
of
the
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what
--
of
what
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
date
of
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
the
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
attorney
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
the
attorney
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
bar
association
have
authority
to
start
the
proceeding
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
have
--
did
he
have
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
a
committee
of
lawyers
--
lawyers
or
judges
had
passed
resolutions
containing
this
precise
language
after
the
case
was
over,
would
you
say
they
could
be
disbarred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
she
had
made
the
same
remarks
at
san
francisco
instead
of
the
--
the
island
an
180
miles
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
all
depends
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
difference
in
the
space
occupied
by
the
printing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
--
by
the
printing.
i
--
i
am
interested
as
much
as
you
say
that.
the
notes
were
how
long
and
how
long
was
the
newspaper
article?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
the
newspaper
article
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
meeting
held
under
the
auspices
of
any
defense
association
or
what
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
regional
--
regional
what
director?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
defense
club?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
say
it
passed
a
very
heavy
burden
on
her,
couldn't
they,
one
that's
very
difficult
to
get
over?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
depend
on
the
feelings
and
beliefs
of
those
who
presided
in
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
and
those
who
passed
on
the
case
here
as
it
came
back
at
the
time
it
came
here,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
your
rules
require
with
reference
to
the
burden
that
one
has
to
meet
who
has
been
suspended
for
a
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
rules
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
publicly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
complaint
that
she
used
the
word
“conspiracy”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
complaint
that
she
used
the
word
“conspiracy”
or
is
it
what
she
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say,
several
times,
that
she
accused
the
government
of
conspiring
to
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
say
that
at
any
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
say
that
at
any
time,
that
she
doesn't
have
anything
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
she
had
made
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
she
had
made
this
identical
speech
at
the
identical
time
in
the
identical
place
and
had
not
been
a
lawyer
in
the
case.
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
any
lawyer
who
had
made
this
speech
should
be
disbarred
just
--
suspended
just
as
she
has
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it
doesn't
depend
of
the
fact
that
she
was
counsel
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
a
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
a
law
review
article?
it
makes
charges
tantamount
to
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
done
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
done
pretty
often,
isn't
it?
i
think
i
have
seen
some
editorial
of
judge
richmond
to
that
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think,
if
you
hadn't
gone
out
and
made
a
speech
somewhere
here
criticizing
the
court
for
what
it's
doing,
that
you
could
have
been
disbarred
in
whole
or
in
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
the
problems
through
history
as
to
what
was
disrespectful
to
the
court
and
to
whether
that
was
enough
to
take
away
a
person's
liberty
or
his
right
to
do
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
been
adopted
as
a
part
of
the
law
of
hawaii?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
statute
adopting
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
--
are
there
any
times
when
people's
rights
to
make
a
living
are
taken
away
from
them
without
a
law
passed
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
hawaii
or
anywhere
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
should
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
should
think
that
that
would
be
a
play
on
words.
a
person
whose
practice,
goes
to
law
school,
i
don't
know
how
long,
takes
all
the
courses
and
gets
ready,
to
say
that
you
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
practice
for
a
year
does
not
affect
their
right
to
have
the
ability
to
earn
a
living.
your
case
may
be
alright
on
the
other
grounds,
but
i
don't
believe
that
would
support
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think,
whichever
it
is,
that
a
lawyer
is
entitled
to
any
less
protection
than
an
ordinary
citizen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
have
to
pass
on
all
those
other
canons
of
ethics
in
order
to
decide
whether
a
lawyer
could
be
disbarred
for
making
a
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
do
you
say
that
this
necessarily
scrapped
the
canons
of
ethics?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
say
anything
else
that
he'd
said?
did
she
say
that
he
--
she
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
say
he
wanted
to
see
her?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
did
she
use
the
word
“yelling?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
she
say
that
her
brother
said
that
the
conviction
was
a
frame
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
law
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
law
against
it
in
hawaii?
is
there
any
statute
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
if
the
--
if
the
lawyer
hears
that
there's
been
misconduct
that
brought
about
the
conviction
of
his
client,
that
he
violates
some
kind
of
law
written
by
the
courts
so
somebody
else
to
make
inquiry
about
it,
of
the
juror?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
this
second
charge
is
based
on,
this
second
--
the
part
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
“studied?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
a
right
to
do
it.
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
their
way,
didn't
they?
i
don't
quite
get
what
you
mean
by
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
use
the
word
“studied”
and
make
that
a
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
then,
under
that
rule,
as
you
understand
it,
even
if
a
person's
file
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
and
he's
learns
that
one
of
the
jurors
says
there
has
been
some
misconduct
that
they
ought
to
know
about,
that
he
would
be
subject
to
disbarment
if
he
went
down
to
the
juror
and
made
inquiries
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
circumstance
that
he
learns
or
he's
told
that
this
juror
says
that
there's
been
misconduct
if
--
that
he
should
know
about
in
connection
with
the
conviction
of
his
client.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
anything
in
any
law
in
any
state
in
this
union
that
bar,
it
may
be
there,
i
don't
know,
i
never
heard
of
it,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
bars
a
lawyer
from
investigating
and
asking
a
juror
after
the
case
is
decided
in
connection
with
an
effort
to
find
out
if
there's
been
something
done
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
do
you
base
the
statement
on
that
there
is
such
a
general
understanding
after
the
jury
has
been
discharged,
anything
but
those
two
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
i'd
like
to
know,
as
this
has
come
out
at
the
last
moment,
is
for
you
to
point
out
in
the
record
where
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
suspension
rests,
in
one
sentence
in
the
whole
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
point
it
out
later
and
send
it
to
us
where
it
would
show
where
that
was
the
basis
on
which
this
second
charge
was
sustained?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
know
that
there's
some
kind
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
some
kind
of
judgments
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
kind
of
judgment
and
some
kind
of
order.
if
a
person
has
been
found
guilty
of
perpetrating
a
false
affidavit,
i
assume
that
you
wouldn't
want
that
done
by
implication.
where
did
the
court
find
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
did
the
bar
association?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
they
charge
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
charge
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
charge
it
and
they
didn't
find
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
us
to
look
at
the
record
to
find
out
if
they
could
have
done
something
on
that
if
they
had
charged
it
and
the
court
had
found
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
question
i
asked
was
did
the
bar
association
charge
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
the
bar
association
didn't
charge
it.
did
the
bar
association
find
that
to
be
a
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
sign
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
sign
it
then
after
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
the
basis
on
which
this
woman
has
been
suspended
from
the
bar,
that
--
that
statement
by
mrs.
--
the
juror's
wife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
saying
is
that's
the
basis
on
which
this
due
process
that
you
say
has
been
given
her
was
given
to
her,
that
they
were
suspending
her
from
the
bar
because
she
has
a
woman
to
sign
an
affidavit
which
the
woman
said
is
not
the
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
we
have
it
up
here
at
all,
the
second
count?
