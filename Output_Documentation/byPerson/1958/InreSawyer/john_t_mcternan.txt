mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
hereby
in
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
which
affirmed
a
judgment
of
the
territorial
supreme
court
of
hawaii
suspending
petitioner,
a
lawyer,
from
the
practice
of
law
for
a
period
of
one
year,
by
virtue
of
the
rules
of
the
local
court
that
suspension
is
tantamount
to
disbarment
because
she
cannot
get
back
without
taking
another
examination
and
passing
the
character
test
and
i
quote
from
the
rule,
"as
an
applicant
for
admission".
the
conduct
upon
which
the
matter
was
tried
in
the
territorial
court
involved
two
incidents,
one
was
a
public
speech
given
in
a
little
hamlet
called
honokaa
over
on
the
island
of
hawaii.
and
the
second
was
a
series
of
interviews
of
a
trial
juror
after
the
case
in
which
that
juror
had
served
--
had
closed
and
the
jury
had
been
dismissed.
let
me
--
i
will
discuss
the
facts
in
each
of
those
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
five
or
six
days,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
approximately
that.
we
contend
that
the
findings
of
gross
misconduct
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
there
is
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
this
juror
had
served
10
months,
your
honor,
in
one
case
and
he
was
dismissed
for
good.
we
contend
that
the
findings
with
reference
to
the
honokaa
speech
are
arbitrary
and
that
the
discipline
imposed
upon
her
involves
an
infringement
of
her
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
she
was
found
to
have
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judge
in
the
remarks
that
where
attributed
to
her.
before
getting
into
the
details
of
our
argument
on
that,
let
me
just
give
you
this
much
background.
counsel
and
her
firm
--
i
mean
petitioner
and
her
firm
were
counsel
for
the
ilwu,
the
dominant
labor
force
in
the
island.
and
the
regional
director
of
that
organization
along
with
six
others
was
indicted
for
conspiracy
to
violate
the
smith
act
in
a
case
called
united
states
against
fujimoto.
petitioner
was
a
counsel
of
record
in
that
case
and
had
been
from
a
day
or
two
after
the
indictment
had
been
returned.
she
was
counsel
for
this
regional
director
whose
name
was
jack
hall.
the
trial
had
been
under
way
for
approximately
six
weeks
at
the
time
of
the
speech.
and
during
those
six
weeks,
the
court
had
her
testimony
from
a
witness
named
paul
crouch,
one
of
the
three
perjurious
witnesses
referred
to
in
an
opinion
of
this
court
in
communist
party
against
sacb.
this
man
had
told
a
story
about
galloping
over
the
russian
steppes
in
1927
at
a
time
when
defendant
in
the
fujimoto
case,
jack
hall,
was
14
years
old
and
another
defendant
was
four
years
old.
and
there
had
been
a
series
of
objections
and
motions
to
strike
with
reference
to
that
testimony,
and
the
testimony
had
been
admitted
subject
to
connection
and
subject
to
later
a
motion.
they
had
also
been
contentions
made
to
the
court
in
fujimoto
that
the
trial
should
not
be
held
because
of
the
adverse
climate
of
public
opinion
and
similar
matters.
now,
the
union
had
set
out
a
defense
committee
which
was
doing
the
job
of
raising
money
for
the
defense,
jack
hall
and
other
people
who
might
be
caught
in
the
then
political
prosecutions
that
where
going
on
both
in
hawaii
and
elsewhere.
and
this
committee
called
the
union
defense
committee
sponsored
the
meeting
at
honokaa
at
which
petitioner
gave
her
speech.
and
it
says
in
the
record
that
this
was
kind
of
rapport
back
to
this
--
this
union
membership
and
some
of
their
friends
from
the
public
who
attended
this
meeting.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
--
as
i
think
i've
indicated
already,
that
honokaa
is
a
small
rural
hamlet
over
on
another
island
about
182
air
miles
from
hawaii
over
open
ocean.
it's
a
little
town
in
the
rural
section
there,
the
sugar
plantation
area.
now,
we
--
as
i
say,
we
attacked
the
findings
that
in
this
speech,
petitioner
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judge
as
arbitrary.
the
issue
obviously
is
from
the
finding
of
the
court,
and
that
will
be
found
at
page
117
of
the
record
or
rather
at
page
118,
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
top
of
--
the
continued
paragraph
at
the
top
of
the
page.
issue
is,
did
the
language,
which
he
used,
impugn
the
integrity
of
judge
wiig?
now,
we
concede
at
the
outset,
because
much
of
it
has
made
of
this
in
appellant's
brief,
that
this
speech
was
largely
all
then
concerning
the
fujimoto
trial.
indeed,
the
speech
was
critical
of
the
conduct
of
the
fujimoto
trial.
and
in
one
or
two
passages,
it
may
reasonably
be
said
that
petitioner
was
critical
of
judge
wiig.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
was
in
progress,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
there
was
taking
evidence.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
trial
had
been
in
progress
for
about
six
weeks.
the
government
was
putting
on
its
case.
it
was
tendering
the
issue
the
communist
party
or
at
least
some
group
within
the
party
was
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
as
i
recall
the
fujimoto
record,
the
evidence
of
this
man,
crouch,
was
put
on,
remote
as
it
was,
back
in
1927,
speaking
as
of
that
date,
to
show
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
and
then
apparently,
the
--
the
burden
still
remained
upon
the
government
to
connect
this
up
with
the
particular
defendants
who
were
standing
trial
there.
there
was
a
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
this
was
the
government's
case-in-chief,
yes
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
which
went
on
for
many
months
after.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think,
the
cross-examination
of
crouch
had
--
may
have
been
concluded
by
that
time.
in
any
event,
i'm
--
i'm
quite
sure
that
there
had
been
cross-examination
of
him
by
the
time
that
this
speech
was
given.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
she
was
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
she
was
one
of
counsel,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
--
various
of
the
defendants
were
represented
by
different
counsels.
she
and
her
partner,
mr.
simons,
were
of
record
for
the
defendant,
jack
hall.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
she
was
one
of
counsel.
she
was
in
the
trial
court
much
of
the
time,
much
--
some
of
the
time,
she
was
out
of
court
because
she
had,
among
the
division
of
labors
among
counsel,
a
large
responsibility
for
research
work
in
the
preparation
of
papers
and
motions,
various
things
of
that
kind.
but
she
was
an
active
counsel
of
record,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
now,
we
say
that
the
mere
fact,
and
--
and
this
is
an
important
aspect
of
appellants
--
of
--
if
respondent's
case,
as
i
understand.
the
mere
fact
that
she
spoke
about
this
trial,
the
fact
that
she
was
critical
of
the
conduct
of
the
trial
or
that
she
was
critical
of
judge
wiig,
do
not,
of
themselves,
prove
that
she
impugned
the
integrity
of
judge
wiig
more
than
that
is
necessary
to
make
out
the
findings
which
the
trial
court
asserted
at
the
place
of
the
record
i've
already
indicated.
let
me
say
and
i
will
review
the
evidence
in
some
detail
in
a
moment
by
i
do
want
to
make
the
general
observations
about
it,
that
i
find
and
i
think
that
the
court
will
look
at
that
speech
inveighed
upon
any
direct
or
explicit
evidence
that
petitioner
impugned
the
--
the
judge's
integrity.
there
was
no
casting
of
any
reflection
upon
his
honesty,
no
charge
of
corruption
or
political
motivation
or
abuse
of
power
or
willful
partiality
nor
is
there
any
evidence
of
direct
and
explicit
attack
upon
the
district
court
or
upon
the
judiciary
generally.
indeed,
the
general
burden
of
her
--
of
her
talk
is
in
quite
a
different
direction.
the
main
thesis
of
her
talk
where
that
the
fujimoto
trial
was
a
trial
of
doctrine
involving
books
and
ideas,
and
that
this
was
bad.
then
in
a
conspiracy
case
like
fujimoto,
the
prosecution
is
predicated
upon
an
alleged
agreement
to
do
something
not
the
actual
doing
of
it
that
in
a
conspiracy
case
there
is
--
like
fujimoto,
there
is
great
latitude
in
the
receipt
of
evidence
of
third
party
declarations
and
third
party
conduct,
that
this
latitude
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
make
its
case,
and
that
the
government
was
constantly
pressing
for
greater
latitude
in
these
respects.
and
these
characteristics
of
fujimoto
are
not
found
in
prosecutions
for
the
substantive
offense
and
they
raise
grave
questions
of
vicarious
guilt
and
finally,
the
thesis
that
the
government's
pretrial
propaganda
in
the
fbi
methods
of
recruiting
witnesses
had
cast
a
--
a
heavy
cloud
of
unfairness
upon
the
trial.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
i
--
i'm
hopefully
happy
you
mentioned
that.
i
intended
to
mention
that
in
my
preliminary
statement.
there
is
no
verbatim
account
of
this
speech.
she
spoke
extemporaneously.
there
was
a
newspaper
reporter
present
who
took
longhand
notes
from
which
he
wrote
the
news
article
which
led
to
all
the
fuzz
over
this.
and
there
is
a
--
an
enlarged
version
of
his
note,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
petitioner's
own
version
of
what
she
had
said
which
she
gave
to
judge
wiig
when
he
asked
her
thereto
after
the
event.
we
--
we
rest
our
position
here
upon
an
analysis
of
the
notes
of
the
newspaper
reporter
and
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
because
we
feel
that
our
attack
here
has
to
be
predicated
upon
the
evidence
against
us,
and
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
resolve
conflicts
in
the
evidence.
so
that
this
--
essentially,
what
i'm
giving
you
now
and
what
i
will
rest
my
argument
on
is
the
notes
of
this
newspaper
reporter
which
were
appended
to
the
opinion
of
the
majority
clause,
appendix
b
and
begin
at
page
573
of
the
record.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
there
was
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
there
was
a
news
account,
your
honor,
given
in
the
newspaper
in
hilo,
hawaii
the
following
day.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
newspaper
account
is
in
the
--
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
it
begins
at
page
559.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
incidentally,
we
attempted
to
--
to
offer
an
analysis
of
the
--
of
the
matsuoka,
that's
the
newspaper
reporter's
name,
notes
in
our
statement
of
the
case
and
that
being
is
at
page
8
of
our
--
of
our
opening
brief.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
his
news
story
made
up
from
his
notes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
not
in
the
news
articles.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
we
think
that
the
news
article
had
no
place
in
the
case
as
a
matter
of
evidence.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
think
that
it
does
--
this
is
not
evidence,
your
honor,
of
what
she
said.
i
think
that
this
is
--
this
is
such
a
matter
of
interpretation
and
selection
and
it's
a
matter
of
--
of
hearsay,
it
would
seem
to
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
indeed,
we
are
because
his
own
note
show
that
she
said
many
other
things
and
then
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
i
think
it's
irrelevant
to
this
case
because
she
was
not
charged,
your
honor,
with
interfering
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice,
and
she
wasn't
found
to
have
committed
any
such
offense.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
on
a
charge
that
she
impugned
to
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judge,
not
on
a
charge
that
he
--
said
she
interfered
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice.
i
think
it's
a
quite
a
difference.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
precisely,
precisely.
this
is
not
only
a
matter
of
pleading,
your
honor,
this
is
a
matter
of
finding
by
the
territorial
court
at
page
118
of
the
record
after
looking
at
the
remarks.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
there
was
a
complaint
which
charged
her
with
impugning
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judge.
this
was
heard
before
a
illegal
ethics
committee
appointed
by
the
territorial
court
which
submitted
its
report
based
upon
the
testimony.
it
found
that
she
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judge.
the
court
then
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
based
upon
that
report,
and
she
responded
to
that
by
filing
a
return.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that
--
it's
just
simple
as
that.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
--
i
think
it
is
reading
them
very
carefully
and
seeing
to
what
she
was
saying.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
don't
think
its
unfair
assumption
applied
to
this
court.
i
think,
if
i
may
say
so
[laughs]
it
applies
to
the
courts
below
because
they
disagreed
with
me.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
correct.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
so
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
your
--
i
would
disagree
with
your
statement
so
far
as
reading
the
account
in
the
paper
because
i
don't
think
the
account
in
the
paper
is
fair
evidence
of
what
she
said.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
and
i
would
say
that
we
would
have
a
different
issue
here
if
petitioner
were
charged
with
having
interfered
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice
in
the
district
court
of
hawaii.
this,
she
was
not
charged.
well
then,
she
was
not
found
guilty
of,
and
she
has
not
been
suspended
for
that
reason.
and
there
is
no
hint
so
far
as
i
can
find
that
this
entire
record
that
this
kind
of
conduct
was
ever
evaluated
by
any
court
below.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
embraces
so
many
unknowns
as
to
involve
as
an
extremely
serious
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
yes,
there
is.
indeed,
there
is
because
the
report,
the
report
picks
out
four
to
five
remarks,
this
is
a
newspaper
article
now,
picks
out
four
to
five
remarks
just
as
the
territorial
court
did
and
indeed,
just
as
the
court
below
did
and
treats
them
as
if
they
had
no
context.
and
by
treating
him
that
way
gives
them
a
meaning
which,
in
the
context,
they
do
not
have,
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
and
--
and
discuss
that
as
though
this
is
the
heart
of
our
case.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that
i
--
that
i
understand
but
i
don't
think
of
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
don't
think
that
a
lawyer's
license
hangs
by
that,
your
honor.
when
the
charges
that
she
called
into
question
the
judge's
integrity,
i
think
again
becomes
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
--
she
--
i
think
that
the
treatment
that
her
remarks
got
the
picking
of
sentence
here
and
picking
of
sentence
there
resulted
in
putting
into
her
mouth
things
she
did
not
say.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
she
is
not
making
a
complaint
against
the
newspaper,
she
is
trying
to
defend
her
life
in
--
on
his
evidentiary
showing
that's
insufficient.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
quite
true.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
but
if
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
but
--
but
if
the
finders
of
the
fact
are
to
determine
what
she
did,
they
had
to
look
at
what
she
said
not
what
the
reporter
selected
from
what
she
said
in
order
to
proof
the
offense
charged
against
her.
going
back
to
the
general
survey
of
her
speech,
in
addition
to
the
thesis
draft,
which
i
have
already
outlined,
let
me
point
out
what
the
subject
matter
of
most
of
her
sentences
where,
and
i
used
language
in
quote,
"men
in
power",
"the
government",
"fbi
agents",
"fbi",
"the
government
witnesses,
crouch
and
johnson”.
judge
wiig
is
not
named
and
the
district
court
is
not
named.
there
is
no
express
assertion
of
any
particular
misconduct
on
the
part
of
--
either
the
judge
or
the
court.
now,
there
is
one
statement,
and
i
refer
to
page
577
of
the
record
which
is
part
of
the
--
of
the
matsuoka
notes
where
she
refers
to
a
federal
judge
sitting
on
a
federal
bench
permitting
crouch
to
testify
about
27
years
ago.
but
i
submit
that
this
compares
the
operation
of
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
substantive
offense
cases
as
against
the
operation
of
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
conspiracy
cases.
i
think
it
maybe
reasonable
to
criticize
to
--
to
construed
that
as
criticizing
judge
wiig's
ruling,
what
it
does
not,
it
does
not
impugned
his
integrity.
it
does
not
go
on
the
question
his
honesty.
therefore,
in
the
absence
of
evidence
directly
or
explicitly
impugning
judge
wiig's
integrity,
it
becomes
necessary
for
respondent
to
rest
upon
interpretation
of
the
evidence
of
the
remarks
attributed
to
petitioner
and
the
implication
is
to
be
drawn
from
them
and
therefore,
becomes
necessary
to
examine
the
nature
and
the
quality
of
that
evidence
very
carefully.
and
here,
we
come,
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
the
issue
that
we
have
just
had.wiig
more
and
a
thousand
cases
called
attention
to
the
untrustworthiness
of
oral
evidence
of
oral
declaration.
this
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
and
wiig
more
points
out
that
the
more
complicated
as
the
utterance,
the
more
necessary
is
it
to
have
the
full
context
of
what
the
speaker
said
and
the
remarks
made
with
this
great
precision
as
possible.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
of
course
not.
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
understand
the
application
of
that
to
this
case.
now,
there
are
eight
witnesses
who
testified
about
this
speech.
their
testimony
is
fragmentary.
it
is
confined
to
the
remarks
charged,
which,
as
i
said,
were
only
four
or
five
taken
out
of
this
speech
as
a
whole.
they
were
given
nearly
two
years
after
the
event,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
that
testimony
to
develop
a
remarkable
position
or
in
context.
we
have
now
the
notes
of
matsuoka,
the
newspaper
reporter,
as
already
been
referred
to.
remember
if
you
will
that
he
took
original
longhand
notes
from
which
he
wrote
his
news
story.
the
news
story
called
cause
--
what
he
called
a
“to
do
in
court”.
and
his
city
editor
then
asked
him
to
type
up
his
notes
which
he
did
in
a
slightly
expanded
form.
now,
he
says
the
slightly
expanded
form
means
that
he
was
spelling
out
ellipses
which
crept
in
to
his
handwriting
when
he
was
writing
in
a
hurry.
i
do
think,
however,
that
the
notes
have
a
certain
post
litem
motam
quality
about
them
and
in
any
event,
they
are
not
verbatim.
incidentally,
the
original
note
that
was
testified,
they
were
turned
over
to
the
fbi
when
it
conducted
an
investigation
which
judge
wiig
ordered,
and
the
original
notes
were
never
produced
in
the
hearing
and
the
fbi
certified
that
it
couldn't
find
them.
these
notes
which
are
in
evidence
then
are
sort
of
two
steps
removed
from
the
original
event
having
been
put
together
after
the
to
do
was
(inaudible)
in
court,
they
are
not
verbatim
and
they
were
--
reflect
a
layman's
understanding
of
fairly
complex
legal
subject
matter.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
in
evidence
as
far
as
--
so
far
as
the
bar
association's
case.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
they
are
gone.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
they
--
they
disappear.
let
me
just
say
this
one
more
thing
about
those
notes.
on
their
face,
they
are
not
petitioner's
words.
they
are
an
interpretation,
if
you
will,
a
rendering
of
petitioner's
words.
in
any
attempt
to
determine
what
petitioner
actually
said,
the
words
which
she
used
is
in
turn
an
interpretation
of
an
interpretation
and
therefore,
constitutes
a
weak
basis
for
extending
very
far
beyond
what
appears
on
the
face
of
the
document.
now,
we
get
down
to
those
notes
themselves.
the
core
of
respondent's
case
turns
on
four
sentences
which
it
is
taken
out
of
context,
out
of
a
30-minute
speech
and
hatch
together
as
if
they
where
a
single
excerpt.
if
the
court
will
follow
me
on
page
577
of
the
record,
we
find
that
the
first
paragraph
breaks
the
words
“there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
fair
trial
in
a
smith
act
case.
all
rules
of
evidence
have
to
be
scrapped
or
the
government
can
make
a
case.”
then
we
go
down
what
represents
the
page
in
the
original
document
to
another
paragraph
that
says,
“there
is
no
fair
trial
in
the
case,
they
just
make
up
the
rules
as
they
go
along.”
now,
those
four
sentences
do
not
belong
together,
they
are
separated
by
important
contextual
material.
they
are
preceded
and
they
are
followed
by
important
contextual
material.
let's
take
the
first
sentence,
“there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
fair
trial
in
a
smith
act
case.”
the
whole
page
of
the
notes
preceding
that
deals
with
what
the
--
the
notes
refer
to
as
a
barrage
of
government
propaganda
carried
on
by
the
government
prior
to
this
trial
making
the
climate
of
public
opinion
unfair
to
these
defendants.
it
talks
about
fbi
tactics
in
recruiting
and
coercing
witnesses
not
only
the
service
witnesses
but
to
say
what
the
government
once
said.
it
seems
to
me,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
constitutes
a
rational
explanation
of
her
statement,
“there
is
no
fair
trial
in
a
smith
act
case.”
and
it
doesn't
--
and
it,
at
least,
is
rational
as
--
saying
that
she
is
charging
judge
wiig
with
deliberately
and
perhaps
dishonestly
causing
the
trial
to
be
unfair.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
we're
raising
two
constitutional
questions.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
we're
--
we're
raising
two
constitutional
questions,
your
honor.
we
claim
that
the
findings
that
she
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judge
are
so
arbitrary
that
it
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
in
--
in
the
way
that
that's
required,
yes,
and
secondly,
that
--
to
discipline
her
for
this
speech
infringes
her
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
taking
this
evidence,
there
is
no
clear
danger
to
a
public
respect
for
the
courts
made
out.
that's
our
--
that's
our
position,
on
--
on
the
first
amendment,
that's
our
position.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
--
i
think
that
when
we
deal
with
--
well,
that
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
we
--
we
deal
here
with
the
--
with
the
social
interest
in
free
speech.
we
deal
with
the
social
interest
in
respect
for
the
court.
we
have
two
weigh
this
competing
interest.
and
i
think
that
given
this
evidence,
the
balance
does
not
make
out
a
--
a
case
of
interference
or
--
or
reflection
upon
the
public
respect
and
confidence
in
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
--
of
course
the
issue
is
not
here.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
and
if
i
were
to
argue
that
issue,
i
would
say
that
--
that
this
speech
does
not
constitute
an
interference
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice
and
nothing
that
flowed
from
it
could
be
reasonably
said
to
what
appear
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
question
is
someone
weighted
by
those
adverbs.
let
me
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
but
i
--
it
presents
a
problem
which
the
case
at
least
suggest
if
it
doesn't
actually
raised.
i
--
i
think
this,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
--
that
there
are
two
categories
of
limitations
on
the
lawyer's
right
of
free
speech.
i
think
that
he
operates
under
the
same
restriction
or
lay
down
or
indicated
in
bridges,
pennekamp
and
craig
as
applicable
to
laymen
as
a
whole.
i
think
that
in
addition,
he
must
--
he
must
not
indulge
in
speech
which
causes
loss
of
public
respect
and
confidence
in
the
court,
the
so-called
canon
1
offense
that
we
referred
to
the
--
the
code
of
ethics
prescribed
by
the
american
bar
association.
there
is
another
canon
that
might
be
involved,
canon
20
which
is
actually
a
fair
administration
of
justice
situation,
the
so-called
leaking
of
essential
information
to
the
newspaper.
now,
so
far
as
i
can
find
in
--
in
my
research
and
we've
given
a
considerable
attention
to
this
and
we
wrote
our
brief
in
such
a
way
that
--
to
challenge
our
adversary
to
find
authorities.
we
could
find
no
authorities
which
say
that
the
limitations
imposed
upon
the
lawyer
are
any
greater
than
this.
now,
i
recognize
that
in
weighing
all
the
factors
in
either
one
of
those
situations,
there
would
be
additional
factors
operating
where
the
lawyer's
speeches
involved
on
the
fair
administration
of
justice
cases
for
example.
it
would
mean
a
lot
more
in
the
public
principles,
the
lawyer
in
the
case
to
say
that
the
witness
testifying
on
the
stand
is
a
lair.
and
that
we're
prepared
to
show
that
he
has
committed
to
all
kinds
of
public
events
and
so
on.
but
i
--
i
think
that
we
have
essentially
the
same
question
of
law
although,
the
--
the
questions
of
fact
could
be
weighed
would
be
somewhat
difficult.
so
also,
in
the
--
in
the
public
respect
and
confidence
in
the
court,
the
case
has
recognized
and
when
a
lawyer
speaks,
casting
reflections
upon
a
judge
or
upon
a
court,
his
words
weigh
more
than
those
of
the
laymen's.
but
again,
we're
dealing
with
the
--
the
same
question
of
law
that
is
slightly
different
questions
of
fact.
now,
getting
back
to
this
--
to
this
analysis
of
the
evidence
because
i
think
context
is
all
important
here
with
reference
to
that
first
sentence
about
no
such
thing
is
a
fair
trial
in
a
smith
act
case.
let
me
suggest
also
that
the
paragraphing
in
those
notes
is
of
significant.
if
the
--
the
statement,
“there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
fair
trial
on
a
smith
act
case”
were
written
in
matsuoka's
notes
as
a
part
of
the
paragraphs
that
preceded
it,
its
relationship
to
that
context
and
the
meaning
it
gets
from
it
would
be
considerably
different.
and
this
paragraphing
is
matsuoka's
paragraphing
not
petitioners.
now,
we
come
to
the
second
sentence,
“all
rules
of
evidence
have
to
be
scrapped
or
the
government
can
make
a
case.”
incidentally,
the
court
below
did
not
find
that
that
remark
had
been
made.
but
in
any
event,
the
context
that
follows
shows
that
what
she
was
talking
about
was
the
disuse,
if
you
will,
of
the
hearsay
rule
in
conspiracy
cases
as
compared
with
substantive
offense
cases.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
while
this
may
have
been
in
exact
language,
it
may
have
been
fully
chosen
language,
what
she
was
saying
is
that
the
conspiracy
technique
results
in
depriving
people
of
the
protection
of
the
hearsay
rule.
and
if
you
go
back
early
in
the
speech,
you'll
find
that
this
is
the
theme
that
she's
struck
in
various
forms
through
out
the
speech.
now,
we
go
down
to
the
next
two
sentences,
“there's
no
fair
trial
in
the
case,
they
just
make
up
the
rules
as
they
go
along.”
the
context
which
precedes
that,
that
which
i
have
discussed
and
the
context
which
follows
it
again
refers
to
the
hearsay
rule
in
the
conspiracy
cases
and
also
to
the
problem
of
remoteness
and
the
government's
pressure
in
these
smith
act
cases
to
enlarge
this
scope
particularly
with
reference
to
remote
evidence
from
case
to
case.
and
this
again
strikes
the
theme
struck
earlier
with
reference
to
crouch
in
russia
in
1927
when
paul
was
13
and
fujimoto
was
four.
it
also,
it
seems
to
me,
indicates
or
finds
support
from
or
my
reading
of
evidence
in
this
respect
finds
support
in
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses,
he
was
a
labor
relations
manager
for
one
of
the
plantations
who
said
that
the
way
he
understood
the
significance
of
the
speech,
he
had
tied
in
to
any
smith
act
case
whether
in
new
york
or
honolulu
or
whatever.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
get
down
by
virtue
of
the
treatment
of
the
evidence
in
the
court
below
to
a
pretty
fine
hair,
that
pronoun
“they”.
the
court
below,
if
you'll
look
at
page
561,
in
setting
forth
its
findings
as
to
what
she
said
puts
--
as
to
paragraph
3,
puts
the
pronoun
“they”
in
quotation
mark.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
561,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
and
respondent
in
its
brief
says
that
they
meant
judge
wiig
because
who
else
was
applying
the
rules
of
evidence?
who
else
was
deciding
admissibility?
but
again,
if
the
court
please,
let
us
look
at
the
context.
we're
back
at
page
577
now.
the
context
about
making
up
the
rules
as
they
go
along
is
one
in
which
he
is
talking
about
the
pressure
of
government
lawyers
in
successive
smith
act
cases
to
expand
the
limits
of
remoteness
in
the
--
in
the
receipt
of
evidence.
and
the
subject
of
the
next
sentence
is
the
word
"attorney"
and
the
subject
of
the
sentence
which
follows
is
“government”
and
she's
talking
about
exactly
the
same
subject
matter.
but
even
more,
if
the
court
please,
let
us
look
at
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
who
dealt
with
this
remark.
and
these
were
the
witnesses
now
whose
testimony
was
focused
just
on
the
remark
and
not
on
the
context
as
a
whole.
six
witnesses
dealt
with
this
remark
in
their
testimony.
four
of
them
said
that
the
subject
of
the
sentence
about
scrapping
the
rules
was
government,
and
two
of
them
said
“they”.
and
i
submit
that
respondent's
position
and
the
position
of
the
court
below
that
“they”
equals
judge
wiig
is
bad
grammar
torn
out
of
context,
contrary
to
the
evidence.
now,
respondent's
case
next
rest
upon
an
excerpt
which
appears
on
the
same
page
577,
the
next
paragraph
which
reads,
“unless
we
stop
this
mistrial
trial
in
its
tracks
here,
there
will
be
a
new
crime.
people
will
be
charged
with
knowing
what
is
included
in
books'
idea.”
now,
i
think
that
the
meaning
of
this
is
perfectly
obvious
that
what
she
was
saying
is
that
smith
act
prosecutions
continue.
we're
going
to
define
as
a
crime
of
reading
books
and
having
ideas.
the
smith
act
will
be
so
applied.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
think
that's
too
remote
from
the
conclusion
to
which
these
courts
reach
in
the
yates
case.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
that
it
--
this
is
the
only
reasonable,
rational
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
sentence.
and
i
think
that
respondent's
construction
of
it
is
utterly
tortured
and
unsound.
they
say
that
this
sentence
means
or
these
two
sentences
mean
that
judge
wiig's
conduct
of
the
trial
was
a
crime.
now,
the
only
way,
if
the
court
please,
that
that
construction
could
possibly
be
supported.
it's
in
the
excerpt
with
the
words
“unless
we
stop
the
smith
trial
in
its
tracks
here,
there
will
be
a
new
crime.
and
that's
cropping
the
evidence,
if
the
court
please.
somewhat
similar
to
the
irresponsible
cropping
of
the
evidence
that
is
conducted
by
a
certain
late
senator
in
a
hearing
conducted
across
the
street
a
few
years
ago.
this
evidence,
if
the
court
please,
does
not
rationally
justify
the
finding
that
petitioner
impugned
judge
wiig's
integrity.
neither
the
lower
court
in
its
opinion
nor
the
territorial
court
in
its
opinion
attempted
to
examine
these
remarks
in
context
or
try
to
ascertain
precisely
what
petitioner
said.
neither
evaluated
the
remarks
in
the
context
of
the
trial
in
which
she
was
speaking.
those
courts
and
especially
respondent
here
gloss
on
to
the
remarks,
words
and
ideas
which
are
not
found
in
the
evidence
and
which
are
contrary
to
the
evidence.
and
if
i
may
pick
out
what
i
think
is
a
--
an
agriedous
example
of
this,
i
refer
the
court
to
pages
57
and
58
of
respondent's
brief,
where
these
very
words,
not
put
in
quotes,
are
treated
this
way,
right
from
the
bottom
of
page
57
that
there
could
be
no
fair
trial
in
the
smith
act
case
because
all
of
the
rules
of
evidence
have
to
be
scrapped
so
the
government
can
make
its
case
and
so
on.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence
from
which
the
word
“because”
can
reasonably
be
interpolated
in
to
her
remark.
it's
not
there
in
the
matsuoka
notes,
it's
not
there
in
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
and
it's
contrary
to
the
context
in
which
she
made
the
statement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence
which
says
or
attributes
to
her
the
remark
that
the
scrapping
of
the
rules
was
so,
that
is
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
government
to
make
its
case.
and
it's
simply
a
--
a
matter
of
interpretation
by
interpolation,
if
you
will,
which
constitutes,
it
seems
to
me,
an
evidentiary
force.it's
just
not
there
and
it
--
and
it
doesn't
belong.
i
submit
that
here,
the
burden
upon
petitioners'
accuses
was
to
establish
the
charges
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
the
charge
that
she
had
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
judge.
i
submit
that
under
the
evidence
here,
the
remarks
are
at
best
dubious
as
an
attack
upon
integrity
and
in
context
there
as
an
obvious
and
rational
construction
of
them
quite
the
other
way.
and
i
submit
that
the
free
speech
aspect
of
this
case
alone
require
the
acceptance
of
the
rational
explanation
of
her
remarks
when
the
evidence
afford
such
(inaudible).
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
first
amendment
aspect
of
the
case
for
the
moment
and
again,
we're
dealing
only
with
the
honokaa
speech.
central
to
the
lower
court's
disposition
of
this
aspect
of
the
case
were
these
two
factors,
first,
that
the
speech
was
given
during
the
pendency
of
the
trial
and
secondly,
by
a
lawyer
of
record
in
the
trial.
and
our
positions
for
reasons
which
i've
indicated
to
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier
are
that
these
two
considerations
have
no
application.
the
value
of
public
discussion
during
the
course
of
the
trial
has
been
pretty
well
spelled
out
by
this
court
in
the
bridges,
pennekamp
and
craig
cases.
i
would
think
that
a
lawyer,
given
his
training
and
his
ability
to
articulate
and
to
expound,
could
be
a
particularly
valuable
contributor
to
public
discussion
when
the
discussion
deals
with
law
and
the
operation
of
law,
law
enforcement
technique
and
so
on.
now,
i
recognize
that
there
are
risks
here,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
already
indicated
them
that
what
is
done
with
the
speech
in
public,
in
the
public
prints
may
resolve
in
their
being
some
impact
upon
the
fair
administration
of
justice.
but
i
think
that
this
calls
for
an
even
nicer
discrimination
of
the
evidence,
if
the
court
please.
that
it
become
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
involving
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
of
a
lawyer.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
contend
that
the
cases
apply
foursquare.
i
think
that
they
have
important
lessons
to
be
drawn
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
by
no
means
control.
but
i
think
that
we
should,
in
--
in
approaching
this
--
the
first
amendment
aspect
of
this
case,
have
fully
in
mind
the
importance
to
public
enlightenment
of
discussion
during
the
pendency
of
the
case
and
the
contribution
which
a
lawyer
was
his
--
inform
the
judgment
can
make
to
this
public
discussion.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
understand
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
i
understand
that.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
--
i
never
assume
that
in
this
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
judge
pope
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
--
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
consideration
embargoes
the
trial
lawyer
in
--
who
is
in
the
case
from
public
comment
upon
the
case
in
which
he
is
engaged.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
--
i
can
understand
why
lawyers'
comment
could
--
the
--
the
comment
of
the
--
of
the
lawyer
of
record
in
the
pending
case
could
have
the
kind
of
impact
upon
the
administration
of
justice
which
you
described.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
find
my
--
necessary
to
reach
that
proposition
at
all
here
because
i
think
that
a
lawyer
has
the
right
to
go
out
and
talk
to
members
of
the
public
about
a
case
in
which
he
is
engaged
to
point
out
the
serious,
social
and
legal
problems
which
that
case
posses
to
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
in
that,
as
the
evidence
clearly
shows,
whatever
he
said
in
those
respects
were
things
which
he
had
already
been
said
to
the
court
were
matters
which
had
already
been
urged
to
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
but
in
any
event,
as
i
--
as
i
said
before
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
this
is
not
the
issue
here.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
i
have
not
fixed
the
speech
apart.
what
has
been
done
by
my
opponents
is
to
pick
the
speech
apart,
they
take
five
sentences
out
of
30-minute
speech
and
say
that
she
attack
the
--
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judge.
if
you
put
those
five
sentences
in
the
context,
she
didn't
attack
any
judge.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
i
think
it
relies
within
the
right
of
the
lawyer
to
say
that
certain
rules
operate
badly
and
certain
rules
caused
unjust
results.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
i
--
i
understand
that
position.
all
i
can
say
to
you
is
what
i
have
said
before
that
we
would
face
a
different
case
here
if
that
issue
had
ever
been
tendered
in
this
case.
it
has
never
been
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
findings
of
the
court
below
are
--
are
as
restricted
as
i
say
they
were.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
there's
another
--
there's
another
element
to
the
case,
this
jury
--
juror
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
as
your
honor
look
at
page
118,
the
findings
of
the
territorial
court,
beginning
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
finding
is
she
engaged
and
participated
in
a
willful
oral
attack
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
and
by
the
said
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
hawaii
and
by
direct
statement
and
implication
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
judge
presiding
therein.
there's
other
formal
language
but
that's
the
essence
of
the
finding
and
that
is
all
that
she
was
suspended
for.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
she
did.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
am
trying
to
outline
to
you
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
she
was
talking
about
this
case
and
she
was
saying
that
there
were
things
about
this
case
that
were
unfair.
there
were
things
about
this
case
that
were
contrary
to
our
constitutional
guarantees,
and
i
think
this,
she
had
a
right
to
say
including
her
comments
upon
operation
and
conspiracy
hearsay
rule.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
it
lies
within
the
right
of
the
lawyer
to
say
that
a
trial
or
doctrine
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
lies
in
the
mouth
of
the
lawyer
to
say
that
the
judges'
honest
straight
forward
interpretation
and
application
to
the
conspiracy
rules
result
in
injustice
in
a
--
in
a
given
case.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
it
has
been
said
many
times
by
higher
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
because
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
the
administration
of
justice
is
no
tender
issue
that
it
cannot
accept
criticism
even
while
the
trial
is
going
on.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
problems
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
a
given
case
are
broader
than
what
occurs
in
a
courtroom
and
these
are
legitimate
subject
to
comment
by
lawyers
including
the
lawyer
in
the
case
so
long
as
she
does
not
dosing
with
or
he
does
not
dosing
which
interfere
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice,
add
to
the
scale's
weight
to
don't
belong
in
the
interlocutory
process.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
your
honor,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
--
it's
proper
to
speak
condemnatorily
about
a
case
where
the
responsibility
of
that
pending
case
lies
not
with
the
trial
judge
but
with
the
prosecutors
in
the
case
or
where
the
responsibility
lies
with
the
law
which
the
judge
is
peacefully
administering,
and
i
don't
see
that
how
a
lawyer
looses
his
--
his
right
to
practice
because
he
called
these
things
to
public
attention
while
they
are
going
on,
what
better
time
to
have
the
public
know
in
--
in
then
--
at
the
time
the
case
is
going
on
and
particularly
a
case
which
is
attracted
so
much
public
attention
is
one
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
i
should
think
that
it
would
certainly
lie
within
the
--
within
the
power
of
an
attorney
who
was
not
in
the
case
and
--
to
--
to
say
these
things
during
the
pendency
of
the
trial.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
not
this
case.
now,
therefore,
we
have
to
address
ourselves
to
what
it
is
about
the
lawyer's
connection
with
the
case
which
--
which
places
the
disability
upon
him.
this,
i
can
find
no
authority
here.
anything
in
the
cases
would
say
that
his
connection
with
the
case
disables
him
from
saying
this.
now,
on
--
i
--
i
do
agree,
as
i
told
mr.
justice
stewart
before
that
i
think
his
position
creates
an
easier
risk
of
interfering
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice
but
i
find
nothing
which
inhibits
his
right
to
speak
in
the
case
merely
because
of
his
--
his
connection
with
the
case.
and
if
you
read
judge
pope's
opinion,
he,
too,
addressed
himself
to
this
question
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
and
he
could
bind
those
(inaudible)
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
but
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
your
last
statement
assume
that
the
lawyer
in
making
this
comment
ipso
facto
by
his
very
position
has
an
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice?
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does.
and
i
--
i
would
say
to
you
that
i
think
that
the
lawyer
in
the
case,
and
this
is
a
problem
which
is
indicated
in
the
opinion
below
that
the
lawyer
in
the
case
does
not
owe
a
duty
to
protect
that
court.
he
owes
a
duty
to
see
one
that
his
clients
are
protected
and
he
owes
a
duty
to
see
that
there
is
public
enlightenment
on
matters
of
public
concern.
and
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
i
cannot
remove
from
the
area
of
public
concern
attention
to
the
specific
evils
which
a
particular
trial
may
--
may
illustrate.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
sir,
excuse
me.
perhaps,
i've
taken
all
of
my
time.
how
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
i
--
i
intended
to
reserve
a
few
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
moments.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
although
i
did
not
have
time
yesterday
to
get
to
the
jury
point,
i
would
like
not
to
get
to
it
today
but
to
speak
to
the
speech
point
because
i
think
that's
the
more
important
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
i
might
reformulate
the
question
you
put
to
my
adversary,
i
would
say
that
the
holding
below
was
that
it
is
unprofessional
conduct
for
a
lawyer
of
record
in
a
pending
case
to
comment
upon
that
case
in
the
manner
petitioner
did
here
because,
and
this
is
the
guts
of
it,
i
think,
that
is
an
attack
on
the
administration
of
justice.
and
i
think
that
is
the
question
begging
aspect
of
the
findings
of
the
courts
below.
what
is
meant
by
“attack?”
“attack”
obviously
embraces
criticism
and
fair
comment,
and
a
lawyer's
utterances
have
to
go
beyond,
it
seems
to
me,
criticism
and
fair
conduct
even
of
the
conduct
of
the
judge
himself
before
he
brings
the
court
into
disrespect,
before
he
interferes
with
a
fair
administration
of
justice,
before
he
loses
his
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that
this
is
a
convention
which
most
lawyers
observe.
it's
one
that
i
observe
in
my
practice.
i
do
this
and
i
think
lawyers
do
it
because
they
are
solicitous
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
interfering
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
something
that
is
compulsory
upon
lawyers
just
because
they
are
in
that
situation
because
what
they
say
may
well
not
interfere
with
the
unfair
administration
of
justice
or
bring
the
court
into
disrespect
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
think
this
is
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
did
it,
in
fact,
do
these
things?
now,
i
would
also
like
to
address
myself
to
what
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
there
is
another
way.
i
think
there
is
another
way
and
i
think
it's
the
kind
of
way
this
court
has
used
in
many
cases
in
the
past.
what
it
does,
it
weigh
the
facts
which
the
record
show.
let's
weigh
them
here,
a
speech
given
over
and
over
or
a
hamlet
of
a
thousand
souls
deep
in
a
plantation
where
the
people
who
listen
to
the
speech
were,
largely,
union
members
who
had
contributed
to
the
defense
of
one
of
the
defendants.
no
publicity
sought
by
this
petitioner.
she
spoke
to
a
gathering
in
using
words
which
at
no
time
were
directed
to
judge
wiig
by
name
or
by
implication
except
in
criticizing
a
ruling
that
he
had
made.
so
far
as
her
intent
may
be
relevant
here
and
intent
was
considered
in
pennekamp,
for
example,
look
at
this
situation
of
a
lawyer
of
unblemished
reputation
for
18
years,
appearing
daily
before
this
judge
in
defense
of
her
time,
bearing
that
kind
of
responsibility.
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
she
intended
to
bring
this
judge
into
disrespect
or
to
attack
him
in
a
way
that
goes
beyond
the
fair
criticism
and
fair
comment?
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
requires
blowing
this
thing
up
into
proportions
all
out
of
relationship
to
the
facts
of
the
record.we
have
an
objective
way
of
deciding
whether
this
reasonably
could
have
interfered
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice.
this
court
has
done
it
time
and
again,
and
it
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
can
do
it
here.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
those
standards
set
up
the
conduct
whereby
we
decide
whether
this
lawyer
conducted
himself
unprofessionally,
and
the
questions
here
come
down
to
bringing
the
court
into
disrespect
or
interfering
with
the
fair
administration
of
justice.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself,
if
i
may,
to
this
concept,
“administration
of
justice,”
because
i
think
that
it
embraces
far
more
than
what
is
involved
in
the
adjudicatory
process.
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
we
find
a
substantial
area
which
is
determined,
in
the
first
instance
at
least,
by
the
prosecutor.
it
is
they
who
decide
whether
the
case
is
going
to
be
brought.
they
decide
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
trial
of
doctrine,
as
the
fujimoto
case
was.
remember,
that
this
is
a
case
that
exploded
along
with
all
the
others
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
yates
case.
they
are
the
ones
who
decide
to
employ
the
conspiracy
charge
in
its
dragnet.
they
are
the
ones
that
decide
how
remote
and
how
much
hearsay
is
going
to
be
used
and
the
--
and
they
also
decide,
if
it
please
the
court,
whether
they
will
employ
or
otherwise
purchase
a
stable
of
witnesses
who
run
about
the
country
for
these
political
prosecutions
tailoring
their
stories
to
fit
the
facts
as
they're
required
in
a
particular
case.
it
was
these
things,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
petitioner
was
attacking.
this
kind
of
administration
of
justice,
she
was
attacking.
she
was
not
attacking
judge
wiig
and
i
say
to
you,
because
i've
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
these
cases,
that
in
1952,
this
sort
of
thing
was
reaching
the
proportions
of
a
national
scandal
and
i,
as
a
member
of
the
bar,
am
proud
of
what
my
client
did
in
attacking
this
kind
of
administration
of
justice
and
it
took
only
a
few
more
years
for
these
things
to
reach
the
level
of
this
court.
and
this
court
did
what
was
necessary
in
some
of
these
respects
to
cleanse
the
springs
of
justice,
and
i
am
proud
of
that
too.
and
it
is,
i
say,
that
a
lawyer
engaged
in
a
trial
of
a
case
has
the
right
to
cry
out
against
this
kind
of
injustice
in
the
administration
of
our
temples
and
he
has,
therefore,
a
valuable
and
important
contribution
to
make
to
public
discussion.
and
it
is
--
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
to
--
it
is
to
adopt
the
false
ideals,
false
criteria
of
protecting
the
adjudicatory
process,
and
i'm
as
concerned
about
that
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is,
but
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
this
area
around
the
adjudicatory
process
which
closely
affects
it,
in
which
the
bar
has
a
duty
to
speak
out
when
that
area
around
it
so
intimately
affects
and
indeed,
and
sometimes
pollutes
and
taints
the
very
adjudicatory
process
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
with
which
we
are
concerned.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
know
that
you
have,
sir,
and
i
--
i
have
intended
no
personal
reference
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
to
you.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
your
honor,
i
think,
as
i
said
yesterday,
it
would
be
one
thing
to
cry
to
the
public,
“judge
wiig
is
a
crook”
or
“judge
wiig
is
biased
in
favor
of
the
prosecution.”
this
is
not
what
this
petitioner
did.
this
petitioner
said,
“the
government,
the
prosecutor
is
handing
judge
wiig
a
stacked
deck.”
that's
what
it
--
he
--
what
she
was
saying
in
effect.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
and
nothing
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
and
nothing
that
she
said
interfered
with
his
power
or
his
right
to
do
that
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--
in
the
slightest
respect.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
this
gets
us
down
to
the
nub
of
the
thing,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
what
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
thank
you,
sir.
i'll
finish
in
less.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
don't
think
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
false
and
artificial
to
say
that
the
--
because
i
think
this
is
what
it
is
involved
in
what
you
said,
that
because
what
she
said
in
condemning
the
conduct
of
prosecutors
and
the
methods
of
prosecutors
dealt
with
a
case
that
was
pending,
she
was
therefore
interfering
with
the
adjudicatory
process.
i
think
that
she
was
not.
she
did
not
reach
that
and
i
think
that
we
can
rely
on
a
good
sense
of
our
--
of
our
citizens
to
know
the
difference
between
criticizing
the
conduct
of
prosecutors
which
disturb
the
adjudicatory
process
and
attacking
that
process
itself.
i
agree
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
a
witness
to
go
out
and
say
--
i
mean,
a
lawyer
to
go
out
and
say,
“this
man
who
is
now
testifying
before
this
court
is
all
a
matter
of
evil
men
and
we
intend
to
prove
this
and
--
and
reach
the
minds
of
the
juror
or
put
pressures
on
the
--
on
the
courtroom
in
that
respect.”
this
is
not
what
was
done
here.
i
was
--
it
was
suggested
yesterday
that
we've
--
that
i
made
an
over
refined
analysis
of
that
speech.
i
ask
you
to
look
at
this
speech
in
terms
of
the
cc
she
said,
the
subject
that
she
was
talking
about
in
her
sentence,
and
break
it
down
sentence
by
sentence
and
phrase
by
phrase,
and
you
will
not
find
--
not
only
will
you
not
find
what
the
territorial
court
said
that
she
was
saying.
you
certainly
will
not
find
what
my
opponent
here
says
that
there
the
--
that
she
charge
a
conspiracy
among
the
judge
--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
sir,
it
was
not
an
abstract
speech.
it
was
an
--
it
was
a
speech
that
went
directly
to
issues
outside
the
adjudicatory
process.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
