justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
stage
of
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
what
--
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
understand
that,
but
--
but
how
far
was
the
trial
gotten?
what
kind
of
issues
was
put?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
case-in-chief
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
cross-examination
of
crouch
had
not
yet
began,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
were
there
accounts,
news
accounts
of
the
--
this
speech
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
contemporaneously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
--
you
think
a
contemporaneous
news
article
by
a
lawyer
in
the
case
--
about
the
case
has
no
place
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
well
understand.
you're
challenging
the
accuracy
of
that
report,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
addition,
you
mean
additional
--
that
--
what
is
--
what
is
printed
is
what
is
printed.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
you
think
a
speech
by
a
lawyer
in
litigation
in
a
criminal
case
then
before
the
jury
meets
three,
printed
in
a
reliable
--
in
a
--
in
a
newspaper
which
circulates
currently
among
the
population
of
the
people
in
what
justice
holmes
called
the
impregnating
atmosphere,
you
think
that
it's
irrelevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
she's
up
before
the
appropriate
authorities
whether
she's
a
fit
person
to
continue
to
practice
without
some
discipline.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
only
--
the
pleading
--
we
are
restricted
to
the
pleading
that
she
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
she
--
is
that
why
she
was
suspended
for
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
can
understand
the
court's
finding
that
she
was
a
lawyer
who
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
court
is
something
--
the
matter
of
it.
but
i
was
wondering
whether
that
was
the
charge,
that
is
the
complaint
that
there
was
any
informal
complaint
against
her
on
which
--
to
which
she
had
to
answer
before
the
appropriate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
bar
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
this
branch
of
your
case
issued
then
a
--
a
very
simple
one,
namely
--
as
i
see
it,
namely,
a
charge
of
impugning
the
integrity
of
the
court
based
on
the
speech,
the
speech
not
prepared
or
extemporaneously
expressed
notes
thereof
taken
by
a
reporter.
those
notes
are
available.
the
notes
--
on
the
basis
of
the
notes,
she
also
printed
something
in
the
paper,
and
all
--
one
has
to
do
is
to
read
those
notes
in
that
paper
and
see
whether
that
fairly
makes
out
charge
of
impugning
the
integrity
of
a
court,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
simple
as
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
meaning
a
few
--
a
figure
to
a
writing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
assume
judges
read
carefully.
is
that
too
unfair
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
all
responsibility
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
that
branch
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
very
simple
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
reading
these
notes
and
as
reported
in
the
paper
and
comparing
it
whether
it
meets
the
test
of
the
charge,
namely,
impugning
the
integrity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
anyhow,
for
the
--
for
the
moment
suspending
that,
for
myself,
when
the
lawyer
in
a
case,
a
particular
case
enmeshed
in
such
emotional
fact
of
this
case
was
makes
a
speech
which
is
bound
to
be
reported,
i
think,
for
myself,
i
cannot
leave
out
of
consideration
how
she'd
be
reported
the
next
day
unless
you
made
a
nice
idyllic
speech
and
is
then
reported
in
a
sanguinary
tone.
i
think
the
fact
that
a
lawyer
makes
a
speech,
he
must
anticipate
that
he'll
be
reported
in
the
meats
of
a
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
assuming
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i'm
assuming
that
the
--
that
the
way
a
reporter
reports
a
speech
for
people
to
read
while
a
case
is
on
trial
itself
may
be
relevant
in
determining
whether
what
she
said
was
susceptible
of
being
interpreted
one
way
rather
than
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
there
a
great
discrepancy
between
what
he
reported
in
his
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
happens
everyday
in
the
most
respectable
of
newspapers,
that
the
limitations
of
space,
of
a
--
of
interpretation,
of
construction,
of
time
lead
to
unsyncopated
report
of
a
long
speech.
that
happens
everyday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
a
lawyer
has
no
responsibility
for
taking
that
fact
into
account.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
just
said
that
he
left
out,
not
that
he
put
in.
he
didn't
put
it
--
did
he
--
let
me
ask
you
this,
did
he
put
into
a
mouth
things
she
didn't
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
never
thought
i
had
a
right
to
complain
when
--
when
responsible
newspapermen
have
done
that
to
me
for
a
lifetime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
i'm
saying
that's
--
it
is
to
be
expected
that
he
make
an
hour
speech
that
a
newspaper
would
print
an
hour
worthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
out
the
hot
stuff,
that's
regulation
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
expect
me
to
disagree
with
you
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
just
a
lawyer.
this
is
an
informed
lawyer
during
the
things
that
lawyers
have
done
in
this
country
over
the
beginning,
namely,
try
to
enlighten
the
public.
this
is
a
fellow
in
a
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
trying
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
assuming
he
is
just
a
citizen
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
said
it.
when
i
think
of
this
dissenting
opinion,
the
lawyer
is
just
a
citizen,
and
free
speech
had
been
formed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
dead
files
are
also
important.
they
are
the
basis
of
our
civilization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
--
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
in
making
features
affecting
the
credibility,
the
words,
the
weight,
the
reliability
of
what
is
going
on
in
court
while
it's
going,
almost,
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
in
regards
to
trial
by
newspapers
as
an
inherent
ingredient,
as
an
important
course
in
this
country
that
said
the
american
way
of
life,
for
myself,
i
repudiate
it
completely
and
regretfully
and
sadly
that
it
should
be
said
but
that's
a
part
of
the
american
way
of
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
deal
the
witnesses
and
their
reliability
as
the
weight
to
be
attached
and
the
way
the
context
of
the
trial
is
going?
that's
what
the
court
rule
is
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
courtroom
is
a
place
from
her
urging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
possibly
issue
here
because
you
go
about
speaking
just
speech
apart
the
way
answering
fixed
apart,
the
way
one
who
speak
apart
answering
speech
in
the
sum
total
would
be
that
he
said
some
very
nice
thing
about
bouslog.
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
didn't
say
i
attack
him
neither
did
--
neither
did
answer
the
happen
in
word.
there
is
skill
in
speech
that
may
convey
the
--
the
intent
as
much
though
as
explicit
and
literal
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
his
duty
to
do
so
far
as
the
public
is
concerned
but
not
on
lawyer
in
a
case,
while
case
is
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
complaint
isn't
as
restricted
as
you
say
it
is.
i've
just
read
the
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
findings
of
the
committee
aren't
even
as
restricted
as
to
that.
i
looked
at
the
complaint.
one
would
suppose
the
complaint
was
she
impugned
the
integrity
of
the
court.
that
is
not
the
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
about
this
matter,
page
3,
the
complaint
doesn't
--
isn't
restricted
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
she
certainly
attacked
the
administration
of
justice
in
and
by
the
district
court,
didn't
she?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
she
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
talked
about
this
case
--
she
talked
about
what
was
going
on
but
that
was
having
an
attack
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
that
case.
i
don't
see
how
you
make
that
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
she
talking
about,
mr.
mcternan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
she
talking
about
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
right
to.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
when
a
lawyer
in
a
case
said,
“i'm
talking
about
the
case
against
commonwealth
--
in
commonwealth
against
jones.
and
i
say
that
the
conduct
of
that
face
is
unfair,
unjust,
violates
the
law
of
the
constitution.”
if
that
is
an
attack
on
the
administration
of
justice,
please
tell
me
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
and
relucent
mutation
and
scrupulous
attention
and
care
to
what
you're
saying
impending
that
prohibition
of
law,
what
i
cannot
understand
is
that
the
charge
of
the
committee
of
a
trial
now
going
on
as
violative
of
law
and
fairness
and
justice
in
the
constitution
is
not
being
an
attack
on
administration
of
justice
in
that
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
cannot
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
listen
to
your
proposition
of
law
if
that's
allowable
indeed,
authorize
--
required
by
the
constitution.
that's
the
proposition
of
law.
but
let's
agree
what
you've
started
with
the
discussing.
we
are
discussing
now
whether
she
did
in
fact
impugn
the
fairness
and
justice
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
simply
that
we
will
make
a
distinction.
i
make
a
distinction
between
what
she
did
and
whether
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
be
allowed
to
do
it.
the
latter,
i
can
see
is
a
serious
question
of
law
to
which
i
shall
i
attend,
i
hope,
for
an
open
and
eager
mind.
but
the
other
thing,
what
it
is
she
did
is,
to
me,
just
a
question
of
fact.did
she
talk
about
this
case?
you
said
she
did.
did
she
talk
about
it
condemnatorily?
she
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
is
--
my
conviction
is
it's
none
of
the
public's
business
to
hear
it
out
of
the
lawyer's
mouth
who's
contemporaneously
engaged
in
trying
a
case
before
a
jury
and
before
a
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
constitutional
problem
and
i
shall
remain
irreconcilable
as
long
as
i
live
to
the
notion
that
the
right
of
talking
by
anybody
under
any
circumstances
is
greater
than
the
right
and
the
duty
and
the
necessity
of
conducting
trials
under
the
only
conditions
under
which
trials
can
fairly
be
conducted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
shall
remain
irreconcilable
on
that
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
of
constitutional
law.
and
on
that,
i
do
not
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i've
taken
up
of
your
time,
mr.
mcternan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
who
determined
--
who
would
determine
in
hawaii
qualifications
to
be
readmitted
to
the
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
supreme
court
suspended
this
member
of
the
bar
for
a
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
hard
time.
i
should
think
any
court
or
tribunal
would
have
a
hard
time
suspending
misconducts
or
violations
of
the
code
of
ethics
of
a
lawyer
for
a
year
and
then
say
that
because
he
suspended
you
for
a
year,
which
means,
a
year
thereafter,
you
never
can
be
admitted
again.
that
they
will
ask
--
indeed,
wasn't
there
one
member
who
thought
she
should
be
disbarred?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
refused
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
disbar
her.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
can't
subsequently
disbar
under
the
pretense
that
they
won't
allow
her
to
take
the
examination
if
she
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement.
i
should
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
anything
about
it,
but
i
should
have
a
hard
time
finding
that
the
court
was
justified
when
it
found
that
the
appropriate
punishment
is
a
year
--
to
be
suspended
for
a
year
then
say,
"oh
well,
that
meant
--
that
year
meant
that
you'll
forever
have
to
disqualify.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
seems
to
me
to
be
playing
tricks
for
its
own
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
talking
about
that
but
that's
a
different
story.
if
fair
questions
were
put
and
the
intellectual
test
isn't
met,
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
the
court
that
said
a
year's
suspension
is
appropriate
response
to
the
misconduct
that
they've
found,
they
couldn't,
afterwards,
say
the
year's
suspension
meant
light
suspension.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
we
took
a
case
that
didn't
have
--
that
was,
i
should
think,
less
clear
than
this
and
we
thought
we
could
review
a
determination.
i
think
your
court
that
solemnly
said
“you
are
to
be
suspended
for
a
year”
can,
on
the
same
basis,
say,
“all
we
meant
was
that
meant
life.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
i
thought
we
had
decided
the
court
can't
be
or
a
state
court
can't
be
arbitrary
even
as
to
admission
or
continuance
at
the
bar,
and
i
can't
imagine
anything
more
arbitrary
than
for
a
court,
a
predecessor
court,
if
you
will,
who
said
a
year
would
be
appropriate
response
to
wrong
doings
then
saying
a
year
meant
life.
i
can't
imagine
anything
more
arbitrary
than
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
no
rules
on
that
sir.
the
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
all
the
decisions
of
your
court
rest
on
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
leave
yourself
time
to
discuss
the
juror
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
go
to
the
judge
but
need
not
tell
him
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
there's
nothing
in
the
law
or
in
the
understanding
of
the
bar
or
in
the
conceptions
of
propriety
that
prevents
him
from
going
to
the
judge,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
based
on
a
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
done
that.
could
you
please
tell
us
what
bearing
what
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
the
lawyer
asked
--
this
lawyer
asked
the
wife
to
sign
an
affidavit
prepared
by
her
which
the
wife
refused
to
sign
because
she
said
it
didn't
contain
what
her
husband
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
in
the
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
before
the
committee
of
the
bar
and
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
ended
to
the
conclusion
on
this
point?
was
that
relevant
to
this
--
to
the
charge?
was
it
relevant
to
the
charge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
a
lawyer
prepared
an
affidavit
containing
things
which
did
not
represent
what
the
witness,
quoted
in
the
affidavit,
supposedly
said
and
asked
somebody
to
sign
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
had
before
it
testimony
that
an
affidavit
is
prepared
which
included
matter
that
did
not
correspond
to
the
author
who
was
quoted
as
having
said
what
was
in
the
affidavit,
and
whether
the
hawaii
supreme
court
deemed
that
relevant
to
the
charge
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
i
got
you
into
this,
i
think
i
will
just
state
what
my
question
was.
my
question
was
whether
there
is
in
the
record
evidence
that
an
affidavit
prepared
by
the
lawyer
purporting
to
set
forth
the
facts
was
submitted
to
a
witness,
to
a
person
to
sign,
mrs.
fuller,
who
refused
to
sign
because
she
said
it
didn't
conform
to
what
she
understood
her
husband
had
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
to
that
was
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
wipe
out
the
fact
that
she
did
prepare
an
affidavit
for
signature
by
the
wife
of
the
man
who's
supposed
to
have
said
what
she
made
him
say
and
the
wife
refused
to
sign
it
because
she
said
that
isn't
what
her
husband
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
still
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mrs.
fuller
never
signed
the
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
didn't
ever
sign
on
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
a
jurisdictional
question
about
this.
i'm
fully
ignorant.
as
i
understand
from
the
cases
that
have
come
here,
the
two
cases,
we
have
said
over
the
last
20
years
that
there
are
certain
limitations
upon
the
reviewing
power
of
the
ninth
circuit
of
judgments
in
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
assume,
as
you
indicate,
assume
that
the
second
--
the
proceeding
--
the
disciplinary
proceeding
had
related
solely
to
the
second
count.
you
just
indicated
that
judge
lemmon
held
that
that
was
not
a
given
basis
for
review,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
whole
case
--
the
whole
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
monetary
amount?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
view,
is
there
a
difference
between
the
subject
matter
of
the
two
charges
so
far
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
concerned?
suppose
the
second
charge
stood
alone.
would
that
be
reviewable
on
the
basis
on
which
they
reviewed
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
that's
the
question
that
we
have
in
other
relations,
namely,
whether
the
monetary
requirement
giving
jurisdiction
is
satisfied,
which
we
struggled
with
that.
the
court
has
struggled
with
it
for
50
years.
this
is
another
case,
but
that
would
be
equally
true
as
to
the
second
count
--
or,
rather,
the
first
count
if
he
had
been
given
the
sentence
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so,
we
have
a
case
here
where
there
were
finding
of
--
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
finding
against
the
defendant
below
on
both
counts
but
sentence
was
imposed
only
on
one
count.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
there
is
no
sentence
here
on
the
count
subject
to
review,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
sentence
here,
nothing
--
nothing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
sentence,
but
there
was
a
determination
of
the
issue,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
you
could
prove
that
except
by
having
the
jurors
say,
“we
heard
about
it
over
the
radio
or
some
gossip
or
the
way
things
are
in
the
air
and
travel,”
and
they
really
impose
our
judgment.
that's
the
only
way
you
could
prove
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
basis
on
which
lawyers
make
it
physical
that
would
reasonably
interfere
with
the
administration
of
justice.
the
basis
is
whether
they
behave
according
to
the
low
standard
by
which
even
--
even
by
the
low
standard
by
which
the
bar
likes
to
be
judged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
we've
heard
this
morning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcternan,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
done
my
crying
in
my
days
but
not
while
i
was
actively
engaged
in
the
trial
of
a
criminal
trial.
i
have
done
my
crying
in
a
number
of
cases
well-known.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
think
you
made
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
think
you
made
any.
i'm
trying
to
make
the
distinction
between
crying
to
the
public
and
attending
to
a
trial
in
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
judge
has
to
rule
on
the
evidence.
the
judge
has
to
control
counsel
and
prosecute
on
defendants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judge
isn't
a
dummy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
what
he
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
related
to
it.
the
judge
doesn't
sit
there
like
an
automaton.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
abstract
speech,
wasn't
it,
mr.
mcternan?
