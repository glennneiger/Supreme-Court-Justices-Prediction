chief
justice
earl

but
these
that
we
do
have
are
the
ones
of
the
bar
association
used,
is
that
correct?
chief

yes.
and

one
that

not
return
were

used
by
the
association
either?
chief
justice

little.[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice

--
chief

warren
yes,
you

reserve
the
rest.
mr.
barlow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand,
the
judge
asked
the
bar
association
sometime
in
july
1954
to
make
the
investigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
then
when
--
when
was
the
report
of
the
--
when
did
they
charge
him?
i'm
speaking
to
the
bar
association.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
was
your
finding
that
he
could
or
could
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
charge
her.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
was
it
advertised?
in
honolulu
or
in
hilo
or
in
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
in
this
little
town
of
1000
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
180
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
180
miles.
that's
180
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
miles
away.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
326,
in
the
matter
of
disciplinary
proceedings
against
harriet
bouslog
sawyer.
mr.
barlow,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
she
held
those
dues
consistently,
is
that
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
say
it?
can
you
say
it
if
you
aren't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
are,
that
opinion,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
can
you
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
given
us
all
of
the
conversation
that
took
place
between
the
two
at
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
the
beginning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
don't
you
give
us
the
sum
of
the
rest
of
it?
that
might
be
important.
all
you
told
us
was
that
she
said,
“my
brother
is
sick,”
and
the
respondent
or
the
applicant
here
said,
“well,
is
he
a
member
of
the
ilwu?”
now,
those
things,
in
themselves,
don't
mean
very
much.
were
they
acquainted?
do
they
know
each
other,
these
people
who
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know.
i
know,
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
told
us
what
the
fair
import
of
this
first
conversation
was
where
the
woman
called.
is
that
all
that
was
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
that
was
said,
that's
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
rather
important
part
of
this
conversation
that
you
only
told
us
fragmentarily,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
tell
us
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no,
but
if
you're
going
to
relate
the
conversation,
i
would
suggest
that
you
relate
the
important
parts
of
it
so
that
--
so
that
we
can
understand
what
the
genesis
of
this
whole
thing
was.
well,
don't
bother
about
that
now.
i'll
give
you
three
minutes
to
--
to
state
your
position
on
this
because
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
--
was
it
misconduct
for
her
to
go
out
and
see
this
juror?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
response
to
this
telephone
message
that
her
client
had
been
framed,
was
it
misconduct
for
her
to
investigate
that
after
her
juror
had
been
discharged
from
duty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
would
be
thousands
of
lawyers
disbarred
in
this
country
if
that
rule
was
observed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
those
cases
--
in
those
cases,
did
the
juror
ask
to
see
the
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
say
it's
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
--
then,
mrs.
bouslog
or
mrs.
sawyer
made
the
affidavit
herself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
that
is
a
false
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
asking
you
--
of
course
in
accord
with
this
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
here
to
indicate
that
--
that
it
is
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
anybody
below
come
to
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcternan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
three
minutes
to
finish
now,
mr.
mcternan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right.
