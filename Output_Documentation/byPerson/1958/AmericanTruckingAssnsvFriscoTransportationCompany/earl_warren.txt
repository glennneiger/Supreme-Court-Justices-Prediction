chief

mr.

you
may

chief

warren
mr.
ginnane
was
there
any
challenge
made
to
that
reservation
that
was
put
in
the
report
of
division
5?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
original
reports.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
that
the,
the
whole
commission
reconsidered
that
question
as
to
whether
that
reservation
was
proper?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
mean
one
of
the
--
before
they
issued
the
first
order
without
the
reservation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
next?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beardsley,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grinnell
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grinnell
before
you
get
away
from
that,
i
would
like
to
ask
this
question
on
the
question
of
inadvertence.
as
i
understood
you,
you
had
unrestricted
right
over
2700
miles
of
your
line,
there
are
only
200
miles
here
involved
approximately.
you
sought
the
same
kind
of
unrestricted
license
for
these
200
miles.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you,
yes,
let
me
just
finish,
let
me
just
finish
this
please
and
you
had
your
hearing
before
department
5,
division
5?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
division
5
made
its
report
in
which
it
denied
to
you
an
unrestricted
right
to
motor
carrier
service.
now
how
long
did
--
you
had
30
days
did
you
not,
in
which
to
appeal
to
the
court.
well
now
--
why
if
it
was
that
important
to
you
as
you
say,
you
tell
us
it
was,
why
did
you
acquiesce
in
that
and
not
appeal
to
the
main,
to
the
full
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
in
that
--
if
that
is
true
then
what,
what
changed
your
mind
about
it
so
that
you
felt
it
was
necessary
for
you
to
challenge
that
reservation
when
the
full
commission
finally
put
it
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
had
no
effect,
what
restricted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
whatever
they
put
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
one
in
number
five,
division
5
was
a
pretty
broad
restriction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
your,
is
it
your
supposition
then
that
at
that
time
that
reservation
was
put
in
there
that
frisco
considered
it
as
no
particular
significance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grinnell
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
mr.
beardsley
talking
about
the
effect
of
this
reservation
said
that
if
there
was
no
hearing
given
to
the
opponents
of
your
protestors
of
your
license
after
the
division
had
found
in
its
favor
on
the
restrictions
and
did
it
in
a
sort
of
a
star
chamber
way
that
that
would
be
depriving
them
of
some
right,
what
would
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
my
point
with
this
would
be
--
main
commission
have
any
more
right
to
reverse
its
division
without
giving
the
protestors
any
notice
at
all
and
it
would
do
it
without
giving
you
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
give
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
give
any
notice
to
the
trucking
concerns?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
assume
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
had
no
notice
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grinnell
may
i
ask
this
is
question
suppose
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
record
clearly
showed
that
this
was
an
inadvertence,
but
it
has
just
been
left
out
by
a
copying
clerk
or
someone
else?
could
the
commission
have
acted
as
it
acted
in
this
case,
in
the
procedure
--
under
the
procedure
which
is
due?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
i
gave
you
my
inadvertence
say
the
certificate
to
denver
instead
of
joplin
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
revocation,
wouldn't
it?
