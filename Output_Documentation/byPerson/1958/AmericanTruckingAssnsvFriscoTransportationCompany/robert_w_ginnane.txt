mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
as
counsel
for
the
appellant
interstate
commerce
commission
in
number
19
and
if
you
please
i'm
sharing
the
time
allotted
to
the
appellants
with
mr.
beardsley
who
is
counsel
for
the
appellant
american
trucking
associations
in
number
15.
these
appeals
present
two
questions
first
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
may
correct
a
motor
carrier
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
to
conform
it
to
the
findings
and
conditions
in
the
commission's
report
which
authorized
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
and
secondly
for
the
majority
of
the
three-judge
court
below
was
correct
in
its
finding
or
conclusion,
but
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case
was
not
the
correct
of
error
in
the
previously
issued
certificates,
but
the
application
of
an
intervening
change
in
commission
policy.
turning
to
the
facts,
late
in
1938
and
early
in
1939,
after
hearings,
division
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
issued
three
reports,
authorizing
the
appellee,
frisco
transportation
company,
to
acquire
the
operating
rights
and
properties
of
four
independent
motor
carriers
that
are
referred
to
in
the
record
as
parker,
tolson,
hamm
and
cooper.
frisco
transportation
company
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
frisco
railroad.
each
report
authorizing
these
acquisitions
contained
the
finding
or
condition
that
the
authority
herein
rendered
is
subject
to
such
further
limitations,
restrictions,
or
modifications
as
the
commission
may
hereafter
find
necessary
to
impose,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
service
shall
be
auxiliary
or
supplemental
to
the
trained
service
of
the
railroad
and
will
not
unduly
restrain
competition.
the
appellee
frisco
took
no
exception
to
these
reports,
did
not
petition
for
reconsideration
by
the
entire
commission,
but
consummated
the
purchases
and
began
operation
of
the
properties
early
in
1939.
on
various
dates
between
march
and
july
1939,
there
were
issued
from
the
commission
four
so
called
compliance
orders,
each
stated
as
to
each
of
the
acquisitions
here
involved,
that
appellant
compliance
with
the
rates
and
insurance
requirements
of
the
act,
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
issue
to
frisco,
authorizing
it
to
conduct
the
particular
motor
carrier
operation.
however,
each
of
these
four
so
called
compliance
orders
in
describing
the
authority
granted
to
frisco,
omitted
the
proviso
or
condition
in
the
commission's
report,
that
there
shall
be
a
reservation
of
power
to
impose
future
restrictions.
in
july
1941,
after
issuance
of
the
compliance
orders,
campbell
sixty-six
express,
an
independent
motor
carrier
competing
with
frisco,
and
other
motor
carriers
filed
with
the
commission
a
complaint
alleging
that
frisco
was
performing
motor
carrier
operations
on
these
routes,
in
excess
of
the
service
authorized
by
the
commission.
and
in
march
and
april
1942,
while
this
campbell
sixty-six
complaint
was
still
pending
before
the
commission,
there
were
issued
to
frisco,
four
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
covering
these
four
acquisitions,
and
these
four
certificates
also
failed
to
contain
any
reservation
of
power
such
as
was
called
for
by
the
prior
reports
of
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct
sir.
in
1943,
in
the
complaint
proceeding,
division
5
of
the
commission
concluded
that
frisco
was
engaging
in
motor
carrier
operations
in
excess
of
the
authority,
which
division
5
had
previously
granted,
and
it
directed
that
the
acquisition
proceedings,
the
four
acquisition
proceedings
be
reopened
to
determine
what
restrictions
should
be
placed
in
frisco
certificates.
upon
reconsideration,
the
entire
commission
reversed
in
part,
stating
that
frisco
was
not
in
violation
of
its
then
unrestricted
certificates,
and
so
the
test
of
violation
is
whether
the
operations
depart
from
the
terms
of
the
certificate,
and
the
entire
commission
said,
since
they
are
consistent
with
the
present
certificates,
there
is
no
violation,
but
the
entire
commission
left
open
the
issue
of
whether
the
certificates
should
be
modified
to
contain
such
a
reservation
of
power
to
impose
conditions.
in
the
reopened
acquisition
proceedings,
division
5
in
1951,
and
the
entire
commission
in
1953,
held
that
the
issuance
of
the
four
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
without
the
reservation
of
power
to
impose
conditions,
required
by
the
original
reports
of
division
5
in
authorizing
the
acquisitions,
was
the
result
of
inadvertence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
division
5
in
1943
had
directed
that
the
proceeding
to
be
reopened,
on
reconsideration
the
entire
commission
sustained
that
portion.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
a
good
chunk
of
it
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
impact
of
the
war.
well
the
impact
of
world
war
movement,
there
was
no
problem
--
effect
on
competitors.
there
was
no
urgency
to
protecting
competitors
from
any
error
there
may
have
been
in
the
certificates,
because
every
motor
carrier
in
the
country
had
more
business
than
it
could
handle.
then
shortly
after
the
war,
beginning
about
1948,
there
was
under
way
both
before
the
commission
and
ultimately
coming
to
this
court
to
be
decided
in
1951,
the
protracted
rock
island
motor
transit
litigation,
which
involved
the
question
whether
under
any
circumstances
the
commission
could
insert
in
a
certificate
such
a
reservation
of
power
to
impose
future
conditions,
and
that
issue,
although
the
commission
under
any
circumstances
could
impose
such
a
reservation
of
power,
was
not
settled
by
this
court
until
1951,
i
think
in
february
1951.
thereafter
frisco
brought
a
suit
in
the
court
below
which
was
--
with
judge
moore
dissenting
to
set
aside
the
commission's
order.
we
contend
first
that
the
commission
does
have
power
to
correct
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
to
confirm
it
to
the
findings
and
conditions
which
the
commission
under
the
compulsion
of
law
puts
in
its
reports
to
support
the
issuance
of
a
--
to
support
the
grant
of
operating
authority.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
absence
of
appropriate
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
absence
of
appropriate
findings
of
the
commission's
act
will
be
set
aside
by
the
courts.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
the
commission
authorized
to
frisco,
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
a
railroad,
to
acquire
the
motor
carrier
operating
rights
of
four
existing
motor
carriers.
now
section
5(2)(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
provides
that
such
acquisitions
by
a
railroad
or
its
affiliate
maybe
authorized
by
the
commission
if
the
commission
finds
that
the
proposed
acquisitions
not
only
are
in
the
public
interest
but
also
will
enable
such
railroad
carrier
to
use
service
by
motor
vehicle
to
public
advantage
in
its
operations
and
will
not
unduly
restrain
competition.
now
this
congressional
policy
against
unlimited
motor
carrier
operations
by
railroads
has
been
before
this
court
several
times.
specifically
in
the
first
rock
island
motor
transit
case
in
340
united
states
this
court
held
that
to
carry
out
this
congressional
policy,
the
commission
in
authorizing
such
an
acquisition
by
rail
affiliate
may
insert
in
the
certificate
which
it
issues
to
the
rail
affiliate
a
reservation
of
power
to
impose
future
conditions
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
motor
carrier
service
remains
auxiliary
and
supplemental
to
the
train
service
of
the
railroad.
and
also
just
this
last
term
in
the
american
trucking
association
case,
this
court
held
that
while
the
commission
may
authorize
unrestricted
motor
carrier
operations
in
special
circumstances
that
its
action
in
doing
so
must
be
supported
by
appropriate
findings
and
edits.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
207.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
in
several
cases
that
it
may
--
even
under
5(2)(b)
it
may
authorize
unrestricted
operations
in
special
circumstances.
a
feature
of
this
case
is
that
it
did
not
purport
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
briefly
we
take
the
distinction
there
as
it
is
and
a
major
feature
in
that
case
which
is
absent
here
is
that
there
the
commission
purported
to
correct
or
modify
a
certificate
without
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
the
certificate
holder.
here
there
has
been
a
hearing,
hearings
and
due
process
to
the
extent
of
some
years.
in
other
words,
when
the
commission
acts
to
authorize
a
rail
affiliate
to
acquire
motor
carrier
operating
rights,
act
to
define
the
scope
of
the
operations
when
it
permits,
its
actions
must
be
supported
by
findings,
and
the
law
is
clear
in
the
absence
of
such
findings
the
courts
upon
challenge
will
set
aside
the
commission's
orders.
at
the
same
time
these
proceedings
are
not
just
a
matter
between
the
commission
and
frisco.
competing
independent
motor
carriers
have
a
right
to
be
heard
before
the
commission,
they
have
a
right
to
challenge
the
commission's
orders
in
the
courts
and
we
think
they
are
entitled
to
assume
that
the
findings
and
conditions
set
forth
in
the
commission's
reports
fairly
describe
the
action
which
it's
about
to
take.
now
the
four
certificates
involved
in
this
case
were
issued
on
the
basis
of
three
reports
of
the
commission.
and
it's
undisputed
that
in
each
report
the
commission,
division
5,
made
the
findings
required
by
section
5(2)(b)
where
the
acquisition
is
by
a
rail
affiliate.
and
that
at
each
report
these
crucial
findings
were
made
subject
to
a
reservation
of
power
to
impose
the
future
conditions.
no
later
report
of
the
commission
or
of
any
division
of
the
commission
ever
purported
to
modify
or
vacate
those
findings
or
the
proviso
reservation
which
was
a
part
of
the
findings.
the
requirements
of
hearings
and
findings
are
valuable
procedural
rights.
and
where
the
commission
acts
after
a
hearing
required
by
law
and
makes
findings
required
by
law,
it
disclaims
any
power
to
make
a
farce
out
of
the
hearing
and
out
of
the
findings
by
taking
action
that
substantially
differs
from
the
findings,
to
issue
a
certificate
that
differs
substantially
from
the
findings
that
are
made
in
the
commission's
report.
rather
the
commission
believes
that
when
such
a
matter
is
discovered,
called
to
its
attention,
it
has
both
the
power
and
duty
to
correct
the
certificate
to
confirm
with
the
findings
as
required
by
law.
now
we
submit
that
every
tribunal,
court,
or
administrative
agency
inherently
has
this
power
to
put
back
the
integrity
of
its
proceedings
and
the
case
of
the
courts,
rule
68
or
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
is
express
that
clerical
mistakes
in
judgments
orders
or
other
parts
of
the
record
and
errors
therein
arising
from
oversight
or
omission
maybe
corrected
by
the
court
at
any
time
of
its
own
initiative
or
on
the
motion
of
any
party
and
after
such
notice
if
any
as
the
court
orders.
section
17(3)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
provides
that
the
commission
shall
conduct
its
proceedings
under
any
provision
of
law
in
such
manner
as
we
are
conduced
to
the
proper
dispatch
of
business
and
the
ends
of
justice.
now
we
submit
that
under
this
provision
the
commission
has
the
same
power
of
a
court
to
correct
clerical
errors
in
its
orders
and
certificates.
in
our
brief,
we
call
attention
to
other
cases,
other
examples
in
which
the
commission
has
occasion
to
correct
obvious
error
in
certificates
of
public
opinions
and
necessity.
an
example
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
but
which
illustrates
the
point
more
sharply
than
any
which
we
do
mention,
the
commission
once
issued
a
certificate
authorizing
service
among
other
points
to
norris
town,
new
jersey.
there
is
no
norris
town
in
new
jersey.
well
the
section
of
certificates
that
it
would
be
helpful
and
clarify
the
matter
so
they
issued
the
certificate,
morristown,
new
jersey,
a
substantial
industrial
center,
but
to
point
for
which
the
applicant
had
not
even
asked
authority
to
serve.
finally
the
commission
issued
a
supplemental
report
in
a
new
certificate
reading
as
it
should
have
been
from
the
beginning
norristown,
pennsylvania.
now
the
commission
grants
in
whole
or
in
part,
even
at
the
present
time,
about
2000
applications
for
permanent
certificates
and
licenses
a
year
and
back
in
the
1940s
the
annual
volume
was
more.
occasional
mistakes,
crude
silly
mistakes
occasionally
will
happen
and
we
think
it's
in
the
public
interest
and
fairness
to
parties
that
the
commission
should
be
able
to
correct
such
mistakes.
now
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
to
all
four.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
there
were
two
others
bennett
and
rose.
when
the
bennett
certificate
was
issued
by
the
commission
section
of
certificates,
the
bennett
certificate
contained
the
reservation
of
power.
the
rose
case
is
no
longer
--
the
rose
certificate
is
no
longer
involved
here
because
under
the
peculiar
facts
of
those
cases
--
of
that
case
the
commission
waived
the
limitation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
i
recall
it
wasn't.
now
in
the
seatrain
case
back
in
329
u.s.,
this
court
specifically
refrained
from
passing
up
on
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
has
power
to
correct
errors
in
certificates.
in
the
mean
time
the
district
court
and
judges
that
have
dealt
with
the
matter
have
divided.
the
court
below
in
this
case,
with
judge
moore
dissenting,
apparently
believed
that
section
212(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
precludes
the
commission
from
revoking
or
modifying
a
certificate
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
errors.
now
the
text
of
212(a)
is
set
forth
at
pages
32
and
33
of
our
brief.
as
pertinent
here
section
212(a)
does
two
things,
first
it
provides
that
certificates,
permits,
and
licenses
shall
be
effective
from
the
date
specified
therein
and
shall
remain
in
effect
until
suspended
or
terminated
as
herein
provided.
now
clearly
that
provision
is
intended
to
provide
finality
and
stability
for
properly
issued
certificates.
we
think
it's
distorted
if
it's
read
to
prevent
the
correction
of
errors
in
certificates,
errors
which
can
impair
the
value
and
the
stability
of
other
outstanding
certificates
in
the
hands
of
competing
carriers.
and
we
think
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
give
greater
finality
to
certificates
against
correction
of
error
than
it
gives
to
judgments
under
rule
68
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
or
to
these
which
everywhere
today
tend
to
reform
to
eliminate
obvious
errors.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
was
certainly
a
premise
of
that
opinion
and
one
which
we
had
to
meet
here.
it
seem
to
us
that
probably
they
were
holding
and
i
am
not
sure
but
probably
they
were
holding
that
correction
of
a
certificate
once
issued
amounted
pro
tanto
to
a
modification
or
revocation
prohibited
by
section
212(a).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
those
original
reports?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir,
frisco
transportation
company
did
not
petition
for
reconsideration
by
the
entire
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
the
full
commission
didn't
get
to
this
matter
until
several
years
later.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
indications.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
nothing,
no
indication
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
nothing
in
the
record
and
nothing
that
i
know
of
from
any
other
source.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
four
reports
or
opinions
of
division
5
said
that
the
authority
herein
granted
is
subject
to
the
reservation
of
power
to
impose
such
future
conditions
as
is
necessary
to
restrict
the
motor
carrier
service
to
service
auxiliary
and
supplemental
for
the
train
service.
when
the
compliance
orders
were
issued,
describing
the
certificate
which
would
be
granted,
which
would
be
granted
to
frisco
the
compliance
order
said
nothing
about
such
a
reservation.
and
as
i
pointed
out
when
the
certificates
themselves
were
issued,
they
did
not
contain
the
reservation
of
power.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
originated
in
the
original
grandfather
procedure
the
commission
so
far
as
possible
diluted
with
thousands
of
grandfather
applications
tried
to
process
as
many
as
possible
without
hearing
procedures.
of
course
they
were
dangerous
to
them.
so
that
when
it
had
determined
tentatively
what
grandfather
certificate
it
would
issue,
it
would
issue
this
compliance
order
and
the
compliance
order
would
describe
the
terms
of
the
authority
which
the
commission
proposed
to
grant
upon
compliance
with
the
rate
and
insurance
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
in
the
section
of
certificates
in
the
bureau
of
motor
carriers.
so
under
those
circumstances,
the
compliance
order
in
those
days
served
a
valuable
notice
function
to
competitors.
now
when
you
get
to
the
later
proceedings
or
even
grandfather
proceedings
which
are
the
subject
of
hearing
and
reports
--
and
published
reports
by
the
commission
then
the
compliance
order
doesn't
particularly
serve
that
function.
at
that
point
it
becomes
more
or
less
a
recording
document.
it
goes
to
the
applicant
and
says
when
you
comply
with
the
insurance
and
rate
requirements
and
you
must
do
so
in
so
many
days
then
we'll
issue
your
certificate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
my
associate
mr.
beardsley
has
some
information
on
the
extent
to
which
the
compliance
orders
were
served
in
this
matter.
of
course
the
commission's
report
was
served
and
then
was
a
public
document
and
of
course
before
the
certificates,
the
public
convenience
necessity
was
entered
in
this
case.
competing
motor
carriers
had
filed
a
compliant,
a
formal
compliant
with
the
commission
alleging
that
on
these
routes
frisco
was
engaging
in
operations
more
extensive
than
those
authorized
by
division
5.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
the
compliance
order
is
addressed
primarily
to
the
applicant,
send
out
to
the
applicant.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
it
tells
him
that
upon
compliance
the
insurance
and
rate
requirements,
a
certificate
will
issue
to
him.
and
as
in
these
cases
the
terms
of
the
proposed
certificate
are
set
forth
as
an
appendix
to
the
compliance
order.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
those
are
separate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
formalization
is
in
a
separate
order
which
comes
out
with
the
report.
now
on
page
431
in
the
record--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
an
order.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
and
if
you'll
turn
to
page
448,
there
is
a
compliance
order.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
the
time
or
very
shortly
thereafter,
essentially
it
accompanies
the
report.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
formal
order
accompanying
the
report.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
then
the
compliance
order
issued
separately,
and
that's
months
afterwards,
an
example
that
as
on
page
441
of
the
transcript.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
i
agree
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
it's
over
the
secretary
signature.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
section
of
certificates
of
the
bureau
of
motor
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
i
have
to
withdraw
that
statement,
it
normally
would
follow.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
that
period
probably
within
a
matter
of
two
or
three
weeks.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
now
we
submit
that
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
necessity
does
not
cut
off
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
action
of
authorizing
--
in
authorizing
the
issuance
of
a
certificate.
that
is
section
212(a)
can't
cut
off
judicial
review
just
because
the
certificate
was
issued.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
and
frequently
do
–
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
but
in
the
american
trucking
association
case,
back
in
326,
the
certificates
had
actually
issued,
and
in
other
cases
in
which
the
certificates
have
actually
issued,
and
no
one
has
seriously
contented,
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
cut
off
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
action
in
authorizing
issuance
of
a
certificate.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
it
will
pointless
to
interpret
212(a),
as
precluding
the
commission
from
voluntarily
correcting
its
own
errors,
but
the
same,
even
though
we
recognize
an
obvious
error,
we
must
wait
until
a
suit
is
brought
in
court,
until
judicial
action
compels
us
to
clean
up
the
situation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
but
the
question
through,
the
numbers
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
number
by
itself
tells
nothing
as
to
what
the
scope
is
about?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
technical
document.
the
second
thing
that
section
212(a)
has
is
to
prohibit
the
suspension,
modification
or
revocation
of
certificates,
except
for
willful
failure
to
comply
with
the
act
or
with
the
commission's
rules
or
orders
under
the
act.
now
we
submit
that
this
delineation
of
the
grounds
on
which
certificates
can
be
modified
or
revoked,
relates
only
to
the
substantive
ground
for
revocation.
we
think
as
this
court
suggested
in
seatrain,
that
it
protects
the
holder
of
a
certificate,
against
retroactive
changes
in
commission
policy.
but
we
don't
think
it
was
ever
intended
to
preclude
the
correction
of
errors,
which
if
the
commission
doesn't
correct
itself,
the
courts
will
surely
do
so.
now
we
think
the
proper
concept
of
section
212(a)
was
suggested
by
this
court
last
term
in
the
nelson
case.
that
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
disagreement
between
the
commission
and
the
carrier,
as
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
a
certificate.
and
always
as
in
such
interpretation
problems,
the
carrier
claims
that
the
commission
by
its
interpretation
is
modifying
the
certificate
in
violation
of
212(a).
and
to
that
contention
and
that
case,
this
court
said,
it
is
true
of
course
that
limitations
and
commission
power
to
modify
motor
carrier
permits
established
in
section
212(a)
of
the
act
cannot
be
bypassed
under
a
guise
of
an
interpretive
action.
commission
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
a
permit,
being
simply
a
definitive
declaration
of
what
rights
existed
from
the
very
beginning
under
the
permit,
cannot
be
equated
with
modification
however,
unless
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
and
we
say
here,
that
the
correction
of
an
error
in
a
certificate,
to
conform
it
to
the
findings
required
by
law,
is
not
an
attempt
to
bypass
the
requirements
of
212(a),
anymore
than
the
legitimate
interpretation
of
a
certificate.
as
this
court
held
in
the
nelson
case,
is
the
bypassing
or
evasion
of
section
212(a).
now
the
second
theme
in
the
decision
below,
perhaps
the
major
theme
as
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
was
the
finding
of
the
majority
below,
that
the
commission's
action
in
modifying
frisco
certificates,
wasn't
merely
a
correction
of
error,
but
an
attempt
to
apply
to
frisco's
outstanding
certificates
an
intervening
change
in
commission
policy.
now
we
submit
there
is
no
basis
in
law
or
in
fact
by
that
conclusion.
it's
undisputed
that
neither
the
commission,
nor
any
division
of
the
commission
ever
modified
or
vacated
the
findings
in
the
original
reports.
it's
undisputed
that
the
commission
did
not,
and
as
a
matter
of
law
may
not
delegate
to
its
section
of
operating
rights,
any
power
to
issue
certificates,
which
do
not
conform
to
the
commission's
findings
as
required
by
law,
and
it's
settled
by
decisions
of
this
court,
that
neither
a
member,
nor
an
employer
of
the
commission
may
modify
the
commission's
decisions
or
bind
it
contrary
to
law.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
equivalent
of
mandamus
has
been
issued
in
a
variety
of
cases
to
compel
administrative
agencies
to
take
action,
which
they
have
withheld
without
any
justification.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
am
thinking
of
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
a
similar
case
was
issued
under
--
similar
order
was
issued
under
the
emergency
price
control
act
to
require
action
which
had
been
delayed.
and
indeed
that
the
principal
is
expressly
embodied
in
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
gives
to
reviewing
courts,
power
to
compel
agency
action
which
is
unlawfully
withheld.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
only
ministerial
acts.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
here,
there
were
no
petitions
for
reconsideration,
of
the
reports
and
conclusions
at
division
5
in
the
original
acquisition
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
a
plausible
--
i
do
not
in
fact
know
through
the
passage
of
time,
i
would
explain
it
simply
that
we
don't
make
the
same
mistake
all
the
time.
