justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
when
the
whole
commission
set
a
new
hearing,
(inaudible),
the
hearing
of
1951
that
you
just
mentioned.
that
was
begun
as
a
result
of
the
hearing
set
by
the
commission
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
that?
what
i
want
to
know
that
judgment
is
from
1943
or
1951?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
under
compulsion
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
compliance
drafted
by
in
the
secretary's
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
a
loose
one
or
an
unclear
way
of
asking
whether
the
compliance
orders
of
(inaudible)
report
of
the
commission,
of
a
division
of
the
commission.
why
don't
you
tell
us
what
the
proceeding
is
in
the
report
and
then
there's
a
compliance
order
applied,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
an
intra
commission
affair
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
have
a
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
the
document,
is
the
piece
of
paper
of
formal
authorization
of
that
which
is
spelled
out,
reasoned
and
concluded
in
the
report
of
the
division?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
are
2000
of
these,
as
you
indicated
the
mere,
the
mere
bookie
thing,
the
mere
writing,
the
mere
scrutinizing
of
the
formal
order
addressed
in
the
applicant
and
that
which
is
spelled
out,
what
i
have
often
thought
was
too
narrative
of
form
to
mingle
the
form
into
commission's
report
myself,
i
think
they
have
(inaudible)
follow
that
english
custom
of
paragraphing
the
numbers
instead
of
having
it
co-mingled
it
starts
with
the
usual
(inaudible)
commission.
but
--
so
i
want
to
know
what
the
compliance,
whether
the
compliance
order
is
merely
that
a
formal
document
prepared
by
somebody
and
you
tell
in
the
compliance
certificate
division
of
motor
act,
putting
in
technical
concrete
legal
form
that
which
is
contained
narratively
in
the
report,
in
the
output
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wait
a
minute,
431
mr.
ginnane?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
order,
there's
an
order
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
compliance
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
in
this
order
would
you
address
our
attention,
issued
at
the
time
that
the
report
comes
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay
it's
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
go
up
to
next
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
months
after
that
did
you
say?
i
am
not
criticizing,
it's
not
my
business
because
i
--
they
have
burdens
there
of
which
i
am
not
unaware
now,
i
am
just
trying
to
get
the
normal
course
of
procedure
since
the
dealing
here
was
procedural
devices
or
procedural
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
secretary,
(inaudible)
secretary,
that's
the
secretary
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
would
assume
but
you
say
no,
it's
not
in
the
secretary's
role.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it's
preparedly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
months
after?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pretty
promptly
wasn't
it,
as
soon
as
the
business
permits
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
can
seek
review
on
the
basis
of
the
order
on
page
431,
can't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
certificate
gets
a
serial
certificate
number,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
and
that's
the
--
when
the
trucker
is
challenged
on
the
road,
he
produces
that
piece
of
paper
or
a
photostat
copy
has
it,
isn't
that
true?
the
certificate
number
is
on
these
trucks
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
a
technical
document,
whereby
he
is
on
the
road.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
after
the
report
by
division
a
certificate
doesn't
issue
and
no
step
is
taken
by
the
commission
or
any
interested
party
having
standing
to
reconsider
the
report
and
the
order
based
on
it,
would
mandamus
allow
it
for
the
issue
of
the
certificate,
on
the
basis
of
the
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
remember
the
old
(inaudible)
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mandamus
was
allowed
to
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
it
fair
say
then
using
the
technical
term
that
whoever
acts
on
the
order
following
the
report,
exercises
a
ministerial
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
that
the
question
of
reconsideration
of
the
report
and
the
order
upon
it,
an
order
like
431
is
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
address
yourself
before
you
sit
down
mr.
beardsley
to
findings
11,
12
and
13
of
the
conclusions
of
law
and
i
am
using
--
jurisdiction
of
statement
would
be
commission
--
page
40
jurisdiction
of
states,
findings
of
11,
12
and
13.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
in
the
restricted
certificate
which
you
contend,
they
must
charge
rate
--
railroad
rates
as
against
charging
independent
trucker's
rate
if
they're
not
still
confined,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
there
must
have
been
tariffs
on
file
indicating
the
difference
in
rate,
is
that
right?
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
certificate
does
not
still
bind
them,
and
then
they
charge
different
rates,
there
must
tariffs
on
file
indicating
they
are
charging
different
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
whether
in
fact
there
was
such
rate
on
file
but
it's
non-railroad
rate
on
file,
on
the
basis
of
non
restricted
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wanted
--
this
is
not
--
my
question
wasn't
an
argument
with
entirety,
whether
in
fact
there
had
been
on
file
with
the
commission
over
the
years,
rate
based
on
the
assumption
of
the
unrestricted
certificate
for
which
they
now
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
whether
the
practical
thing,
this
has
been
going
on
(inaudible)
you
don't
know
but
theoretically
they
couldn't
do
it,
whereas
if
the
opinion
changes
they
would
be
allowed
to
do
it,
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
below
says
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
was
inadvertently
done
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
justice
whittaker's
question
implied
that
by
the
very
nature
of
the
course
of
business
it
was
an
inadvertence.
if
they
know
in
large
quantity,
is
never
done
and
it
once
is
done,
unless
there
is
some
good
reason
for
doing
it
in
that
case,
which
is
contradicted
by
the
finding
of
the
division,
one
would
naturally
infer
it
was
an
inadvertence
and
yet
the
court,
the
findings
for
which
you
are
appealing
or
the
decision
of
this
case,
the
findings
supporting
the
decision
from
which
you
(inaudible),
makes
an
explicit
finding
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
wasn't
inadvertence.
now
that
is
meant,
by
that
is
meant
affirmative
testimony
of
evidence,
i
can
understand
that
but
it
wouldn't
get
you
anywhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
an
argument,
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
was
intentional,
but
somebody
in
the
book
keeping
department
wrongly
transcribed
the
journal
entry
as
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
standing
on
the
basis
of
the
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
it's
quite
as
accurate
to
say
to
the
court
below
that
they
are
all
wrong,
simply
says
there
is
no
adequate
support
in
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
they
are
all
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
it
won't
take
too
much
time
for
you
to
indicate
if
you
will
mr.
grinnell,
why
in
this
dotted
line
from
(inaudible)
to
wherever
it
is
up
in
st.
louis,
why
commission
denied
to
un-restrict
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
write?
did
they
give
reasons?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it
â€“
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
right
did
they
give
any
reasons?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
acquisitions
in
controversy
here
had
in
the
original
report
of
the
commission
based
on
the
finding
of
its
examiner,
recommendations
and
demands
for
reservations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
grinnell
are
you
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
enlighten
me
on
the
significance
you
wish
us
to
draw
from
directed
planning
rather
403
and
404
that
could
be
a
certificate
or
a
compliant
order
that
was
an
outstanding
at
that
time
was
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
january
11,
1939
the
hamm
business
at
that
time
i
don't
--
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
the
significance
is
because
at
that
time
there
were
really
outstanding
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commission's
description
the
reservation
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
reservation
wasn't
sort
to
be
made
effective,
it's
a
very
different
question
from
the
one
we
have
now,
namely
whether
subsequently
they
could
draw
the
reservation
in
the
report
and
in
the
order
although
it
was
not
putting
to
the
compliance
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
what
comfort
you
get--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
haven't
found
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
grinnell,
may
i
suggest,
anybody
who
had
any
kind
of
long
experience
with
the
commission's
doing
whether
it
counts
or
(inaudible)
of
the
subject
know
the
kind
of
elegant
standard
that
you
expect
from
the
commission
is
not
to
be
had
in
view
of
the
volume
of
their
business
and
they
very
often
do
things
that
people
do
when
they
have
a
massive
business.
and
i
think
the
second
one
here
is
not
that
the
commission
should
explain
why
they
submitted
but
perhaps
it
is
up
to
you
to
explain
why
they
should
have
changed
from
the
basis
of
their
report,
to
the
absence
of
the
condition
of
the
reports
in
the
orders,
in
the
certificate
that
requires
explanation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
felt
what
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
mind
that
the
commission
just
is
an
outsider,
if
you
have
a
response,
if
you
have
a
division
5
putting
that
in
its
report
as
a
condition
of
it,
it
includes
and
then
it
is
absent
in
piece
of
book
what
i
call
book
and
that's
what
the
compliance
order
is,
a
formalization
of
what
they
rationally
found
and
expressed
and
if
there
is
this
gap
between
what
their
reason
was
and
the
former
statement
of
them,
there
must
be
some
explanation
to
that,
why
should
they
be
changing
their
basic
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
plus
there's
--
those
are
facts
--
there
is
another
very
important
factor
one
which
mr.
justice
harlan
called
the
attention
to,
the
assurance
of
the
responsible
body
that
it
wasn't
inadvertence.
you
can't
cast
that
aside
as
having
no
significance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
it
came
but
for
a
body
with
the
responsibility
of
interstate
commerce
at
least.
i
say
that
because
in
a
way
that
has
a
longer
tradition
of
good
conduct
and
excessive
volume
of
business
in
my
point
of
view,
when
they
think
that
you
can't
just
say
well,
prove
it,
the
fact
that
they
make
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
little
puzzle
because
if
i
say
something
i
leave
out
of
phrase
in
the
letter
and
then
say
oh
that's
inadvertence,
on
the
whole
what
kind
of
proof
can
you
have
(inaudible)
except
there
is
evidence
to
indicate
that
he
is
a
liar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
hearing
examiner
has
the
right
to
decide
what's
desirable
to
put
in
a
certificate
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we
don't
know
what
complaints.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference,
isn't
there,
between
a
person
charged
with
responsibility
dealing
with
the
subject
matter,
not
mentioning
the
subject
matter
and
then
saying,
oh
i
inadvertently
i
didn't
attend
to
that
and
the
person
charging
the
responsibility
for
which
division
5
putting
it
in
its
report
not
inadvertent
omission
of
the
subject
matter
but
latter
inadvertent
omission
of
the
book
keeping
of
the
subject
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
and
i,
you
and
i
believe
that
the
commission
incorporates
that
around
division
5
and
that
was
wrong
--
i
assume
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
assume
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
the
power
to
do
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
change
one
document,
i
think
you
must
to
trial
when
you
can
have
both
of
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
doesn't
go
against
your
argument,
but
they
has
to
be
a
revocation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
to
nullify
that
with
some
of
the
other
one
match
if
it
can
match?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
was
suggesting.
