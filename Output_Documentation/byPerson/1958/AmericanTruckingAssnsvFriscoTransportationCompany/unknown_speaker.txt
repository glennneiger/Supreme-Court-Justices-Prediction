unknown
speaker
this
is
something
that
puzzles
me,
i
wanted
us
to
get
straight
on
it,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
original
application,
your
company
had
proceeded
under
the
premise
that
it
was
gong
to
get
â€“
on
the
premise
that
it
sought
and
it
was
gong
to
get
an
unrestricted
certificate.
now
this
is
what
puzzles
me.
in
division
5,
in
the
reopened
proceedings
it
says
that
at
page
651,
the
approval
in
each
of
those
cases,
that's
the
original
applications,
would
have
been
withheld
except
for
the
clear
understanding
that
an
auxiliary
or
a
supplementary
rail
service,
instead
of
an
all
out
independent
motor
service
was
to
be
performed
as
the
transportation
company.
it
may
be
observed
that
as
the
transportation
company
in
effect
agreed
to
the
imposition
of
such
a
limitation
either
in
the
approval
of
the
acquisitions
or
a
later
date,
as
a
condition
subject
to
which
it
made
the
purchases
and
in
fact
itself
described
its
proposed
services
being
so
limited,
there
seemed
at
the
time
the
certificates
were
issued,
no
necessity
for
imposing
any
particular
restrictions
upon
the
character
of
the
service
to
be
performed.
that
puzzles
me
