mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
parties
in
numbers
15,
the
parties
appellants
at
five
independent
motor
carriers
whose
operations
are
competitive
with
those
of
the
frisco,
the
rail
subsidiary
here
and
it's
parent
railroad,
two
trade
associations,
one
of
them
american
trucking
associations,
which
is
simply
the
trade
association
of
the
motor
carrier
industry
and
the
regular
common
carrier
conference
of
american
trucking
associations
which
represents
the
special
interests
of
independent
motor
carriers
operating
over
regular
routes
in
the
transportation
of
general
commodities,
pursuant
to
certificates
issued
by
the
icc.
all
of
the
parties
in
number
15
have
participated
in
these
proceedings,
both
before
the
commission
and
the
district
court.
the
questions
as
we
see
them
are
three-fold
in
this
case.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
commission
has
power,
in
any
event,
to
allow
a
railroad
or
its
affiliate
to
conduct
unrestricted
truck
service
through
the
purchase
of
a
outstanding
certificate
under
section
5,
i'll
deal
with
that
question
if
i
may
last.
the
second
question
as
we
see
it
here
is
could
the
commission,
under
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
even
assuming
that
it
has
power
under
section
5
to
issue
an
unrestricted
certificate,
could
have
authorized
such
service
by
frisco
here,
as
frisco
alleged
it
did
intentionally,
even
though
in
the
only
proceedings
which
were
conducted
in
connection
with
the
rights,
which
are
involved
in
this
case,
the
commission
clearly
indicated
that
the
rail
subsidiary
was
to
acquire
only
a
right
to
operate
a
so
called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
service
and
to
this
day
frisco
has
never
asked
for
reconsideration
of
that
basic
decision.
the
third
question
here
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
the
court
below
erred
in
holding
that
the
certificates
here
in
issue,
weren't
issued
inadvertently
by
the
commission.
now
coming
first
to
the
finding
of
the
court
below,
and
we
must
agree
that
they
squarely
held
that
the
commission
did
intend
to
issue
these
certificates,
of
course
we
adopt
the
argument
that
counsel
for
the
commission
has
made
and
i
would
just
like
to
add
a
little
to
it
if
i
may.
first
let
me
recap
the
situation
very
briefly.
frisco
filed
applications
before
the
commission
to
purchase
the
operating
rights
of
independent
motor
carriers.
a
commission
conducted
hearings
in
these
cases,
and
other
independent
motor
carriers
came
in
and
protested
to
the
commission
in
effect
that
these
rights
should
not
be
granted.
first
--
the
commission
however
did
in
its
reports
from
the
finance
cases,
allow
the
purchase
by
frisco
of
these
independent
carriers.
but
it
said
that
frisco
was
not
acquiring
the
right
to
continue
to
conduct
operations,
just
as
the
independent
carriers
had
conducted,
but
rather
that
frisco
was
to
get
these
rights
to
be
used
in
auxiliary
and
supplemental
service.
now
frisco
never
to
this
day,
with
all
this
time
intervened,
has
asked
the
commission
to
reconsider
those
decisions
in
the
original
finance
cases.
now
at
that
stage
of
the
game
the
independent
motor
carriers
were
obviously
satisfied.
the
commission
in
the
finance
cases
had
met
the
mandate
of
section
5(2)(b)
and
that
section
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
23
and
it
says
in
essence
that
the
commission
in
order
to
authorize
a
railroad
or
subsidiary
to
purchase
an
independent
motor
carrier
must
in
its
order
define
that
the
operations
purchased
will
be
used
to
public
advantage
by
the
railroad,
“in
its
operations”
and
i
think
it
will
be
gilding
really
for
me
to
talk
much
more
about
that.
this
court
will
understand
that
that
is
the
basis
for
the
commissions
coming
up
with
this
term
of
auxiliary
and
supplemental
service.
and
here
is
the
situation
that
the
independent
motor
carriers
find
themselves
in
or
found
themselves
in
there.
without
any
further
proceedings
of
any
kind
before
the
commission,
they
woke
up
one
day
to
find
frisco
operating
up
and
down
the
road
just
as
any
independent
motor
carrier
would
operate.
they
then
filed
a
complaint
with
the
commission
and
that
is
the
campbell
sixty-six,
complaint
that
has
been
referred
to,
to
the
effect
of
such
operations
were
illegal.
now
in
the
year
following
their
complaint,
the
commission
issued
these
unrestricted
certificates
to
frisco.
now
as
we
see
it
the
decision
of
the
court
below
of
majority
at
least
has
two
basic
infirmities.
first
it
completely
failed
to
hold
as
it
should
have
held
that
the
independent
motor
carriers
just
like
frisco
have
some
rather
important
chips
in
this
game.
they
were
entitled
to
rely
on
the
commission's
findings
and
the
underlying
finance
proceedings
that
frisco
was
to
get
only
restricted
operating
rights.
and
second
we
believe
that
the
court
below
failed
to
hold
and
improperly
failed
to
hold
that
the
congressional
policy
which
embodied
in
the
proviso
of
5(2)(b)
absolutely
prohibits
and
here
is
where
we
depart
with
the
commission,
prohibits
the
commission
from
issuing
unrestricted
motor
carrier
authority
to
a
railroad
or
its
affiliate
in
any
event
and
that
therefore
whether
the
commission
did
in
fact
issue
these
certificates
inadvertently
or
otherwise,
they
were
a
novelty
because
they
exceeded
the
commission's
power.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well
perhaps
so,
but
the
reservation
order
would
indicate
that
commission
had
complied
with
the
mandate
of
5(2)(b)
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
would
stop
right
here
and
point
out
that
the
court
below
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
was
changing
its
policy.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
this
isn't
the
commission's
policy
to
change
or
not
to
change,
this
is
a
congressional
policy
which
as
we
see
it,
the
commission
is
bound
to
obey.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
but
let
me
assume
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument
that
i
now
about
to
make
that
as
the
majority
below
held
the
commission
did
change
its
mind
somewhere
along
the
line,
we
are
not
told
when,
how,
what
or
why?
but
let's
say
that
the
commission
changed
its
mind
after
it
had
formerly
issued
its
reports
and
orders
in
the
finance
cases
holding
that
frisco
was
to
receive
only
restricted
operating
rights.
at
some
time
between
that
time
and
a
time
that
these
so
called
compliance
orders
were
issued,
the
commission
had
decided
well
we
were
wrong
and
we
will
give
them
unrestricted
rights
and
we
will
evidence
that
by
these
compliance
orders
which
we
are
now
issuing,
which
is
the
essence
of
frisco's
claim.
we
say
that
if
the
commission
did
that
that
it
decried
the
motor
carrier
protestors
in
the
underlying
finance
cases
of
even
the
rudiments
of
due
process.
we
do
not
think
this
court
for
a
minute
will
hold
--
would
hold
still
for
that
argument,
because
what
would
the
--
what
would
have
been
the
result
of
that
type
of
thing,
carriers
have
gone
before
the
commission,
they
have
been
satisfied
that
the
commission
has
complied
with
the
mandate
of
5(2)(b),
there
is
nothing
more
they
can
do.
they
know
then
and
there
that
frisco
is
not
to
get
anything
more
than
the
so
called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
settlements.
now
if
the
commission
by
some
process
of
a
star
chamber
operation
and
that's
what
is
suggested
here
in
the
final
analysis
it
couldn't
be
anything
else,
there
have
never
been
any
formal
record
with
court
proceeding
on
anything
of
that
kind
where
the
independent
motor
carriers
who
once
knew
that
frisco
was
getting
only
restrictive
rights,
have
ever
been
told
anything
different.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
now
it's
interesting
in
that
connection
that
while
frisco
makes
an
effort
and
contends
throughout
that
this
compliance
order
went
out
to
everybody,
they
have
never
gone
to
the
commission
and
gotten
a
certificate
from
the
secretary
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
just
whom
those
compliance
orders
were
served.
now
i
am
trying
to
say
that,
what
i
have
here
is
not
in
the
record,
but
then
what
frisco
was
talking
about
is
not
in
the
record
either.
we
have
researched
these
cases
in
the
commission's
files
and
we
find
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
compliance
orders
were
served
on
council
who
were
protestors
in
the
reason
of
grandfather
cases;
and
where
the
same
council
was
not
a
protestor
in
the
finance
case
he
didn't
resort
to
receive
the
compliance
order.
but
i
would
go
farther
mr.
justice
harlan
and
say
this
that
even
if
a
carrier
in
this
--
in
one
of
these
cases
received
a
copy
of
a
compliance
order
that
this
statute
which
perhaps
in
the
policy
which
is
embodied
in
5(2)(b)
is
not
for
him
to
wait
--
and
if
he
wants
to.
congress
didn't
say
in
effect
that
the
commission
shall
not
grant
unrestricted
rights
unless
some
of
the
motor
carriers
have
no
objection
to
it.
congress
said
that
the
commission
shall
not
grant
unrestricted
rights
and
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
the
receipt
or
non-receipt
of
a
compliance
order
is
really
a
collateral
matter.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
as
you
quickly
--
as
you
pointed
a
while
back
ago
that
was
a
206
case
where
we
were
asking
this
court
to
read
the
provision
of
5(2)(b)
into
206.
here
we
don't
have
to
ask
you
that,
the
provisions
of
5(2)(b)
either
apply
in
this
case
or
they
are
written
out
of
the
statute
and
that
in
effect
is
what
the
decision
of
the
court
below
does.
we
are
not
asking
you
to
read
anything
in
here
because
5(2)(b)
is
specifically
applicable
through
the
finance
cases
before
the
commission.
now
only
judge
moore
dissenting
below
seems
to
realize
as
a
practical
matter
that
if
the
commission
hasn't
in
fact
made
a
clerical
error
here,
as
a
matter
of
lawistic
pride
the
independent
motors
carrier
is
a
due
process.
we
think
it
completely
and
properly
is
disposed
of
this
phase
of
the
case,
at
record
173,
when
he
said
this,
“i
do
not
see
how
plaintiff
would
justify
changes
in
the
commission's
findings
made
without
giving
notice
or
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
to
those
appearing
at
the
acquisition
proceedings.”
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no
sir,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
would
ask
you
remember
this
that
at
the
findings
procedures,
the
finance
we
are
the
dealing
before
the
commission,
this
law
was
fairly
new.
the
commission
over
the
course
of
years
has
changed
its
mind
for
example
as
to
what
specific
restrictions
ought
to
imposed
in
any
given
case
to
carry
out
the
original
congressional
policy.
for
example
when
they
first
stated
issuing
certificates
to
railroad
affiliates,
they
include
a
so
called
prior
and
subsequent
rail
haul,
which
meant
that
for
the
freight
to
move
in
the
truck
it
had
to
either
moved
by
the
railroad
or
would
have
to
be
scheduled
to
move
by
rail
after
they
are
moved
by
the
truck.
then
in
the
parker
case,
the
proceedings
which
became
a
proper
case
here,
the
commission
substituted
a
so
called
key
point
restriction
for
a
prior
and
subsequent
haul.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this
that
in
every
case
in
which
the
commission
issues
authority
to
a
railroad
or
its
affiliate
pursuant
to
section
5
that
congressional
mandate
is
there
and
we
frankly
with
all
due
respect
don't
believe
that
is
for
the
commission
to
ignore
in
any
given
case,
particularly
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
they
have
never
been
a
claim
before
the
commission,
but
they
are
an
unusual
circumstances
which
would
require
the
commission
to
waive
the
mandate
or
the
proviso
even
if
it
has
the
authority.
now
i
think
some
of
the
questions
here
have
suggested
that
there
maybe
some
equities
in
this
thing
that
frisco
might
be
in
effect
subject
to
inequitable
results
if
this
decision
by
the
court
below
is
set
aside.
in
fact
frisco
raised
that
point
before
the
commission
as
long
ago
in
1946
and
it's
in
the
record
here
at
227.
we
say
that
no
validity
whatsoever
is
denied.
frisco
by
its
admission
knew
when
campbell
sixty-six
filed
its
complaint
before
the
commission
and
that
was
before
it
got
its
certificates,
its
right
to
conduct
an
unrestricted
operation
was
challenged.
in
addition
to
the
fact
frisco
has
defined
it,
received
these
certificates
as
a
well
staffed
and
well
counseled
railroad
subsidiary,
certainly
knew
that
it
had
received
property
to
which
it
wasn't
entitled
either
equitably
or
(inaudible).
and
i
believe
it's
fair
to
say
that
frisco
in
effect
had
clearly
simply
decided
to
move
this
situation
through,
it
simply
sort
of
gambled
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
so
far
it
has
been
a
gamble
which
has
returned
a
handsome
profit
to
frisco.
if
any
one
has
an
equitable
compliant
here,
it's
the
independent
motor
carriers
who
went
all
the
way
they
could
before
the
commission,
found
that
their
efforts
was
successful
in
having
the
commission
enquire
with
the
mandate
of
frisco
and
then
having
cases
of
paper
issued
to
frisco
which
were
contrary
to
the
commission's
findings
in
the
underlying
finance
cases
and
having
to
sit
back
and
watch
frisco
over
the
years
conduct
its
operation
which
has
never
been
authorized
by
commission.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
unrestricted.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
unrestricted
truck
operation,
having
no
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well
as
applied
here
that
the
difference
is
that
frisco
has
no
obligation
under
the
certificates
which
were
issued
to
conduct
a
so
called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
operation.
if
they
do
conduct
one,
it's
only
because
they
want
to,
whereas
the
statute
requires
the
commission
to
authorize
only
those
so
called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
operations,
in
essence
operations
which
are
designed
to
use
truck
service
not
as
an
all
out
truck
operation,
as
an
independent
truck
operator
will
do,
but
an
effort
simply
to
speed
up
the
rail
service,
for
example
by
substituting
a
truck
for
a
so
called
peddler
car
or
a
so
called
railway
car,
a
railway
car.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
to
the
effect
that
they
conduct
unrestricted
truck
operations,
they
can
take
freight
which
they
would
not
get
tendered
to
them
in
the
first
instance
by
the
shipper
who
wanted
truck
service.
i'm
not
prepared
to
state
mr.
justice
black
with
any
degree
of
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well
frisco,
i
don't
know
if
you
have
it
before
you
now,
but
frisco
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
there
is
a
pretty
good
sized
operation
which
has
been
laid
out
here.
i
have
a
map
which
i
believe
that
the
court
has
before
it,
by
frisco,
and
they
have
shown
this
operation
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
just
a
separate
map,
which
i
believe
frisco
has
made
available
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument
and
the
map
itself
shows
pretty
well.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
that's
the
area
directly
involved,
but
you
can
see
that,
how
that
hooks
up
with
the
balance
of
the
map,
the
difference
of
the
make,
if
this
decision
of
the
court
below
is
upheld.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
don't
know
sir
precisely.
in
addition
to
every
thing
else
that's
been
said
here
frisco
for
example
can
move
freight
--
that's
if
these
certificates,
if
they
are
enable
to
keep
these
certificates
frisco
can
move
freight
at
truck
rates
for
example
instead
of
rail
rates,
that
is
just
another
factor
in
that.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir,
but
this
is
all
part
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
if
you
please
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
if
you
leave
these
pieces
in
here
with
no
restriction,
you've
got
a
considerable
operation,
which
frisco
has
never
had
to
prove
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
it,
as
it
would
have
to
do
even
if
it
had
the
right
(inaudible).
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
they
are
the
cooper,
the
hamm,
the
tolson
and
the
parker
purchases
and
they
are
between
(inaudible)
and
blytheville,
between
walnut
ridge
and
memphis
between
i
believe
(inaudible)
and
lake
city
and
between
--
i'm
somewhat
color
blind,
so
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
this
map,
between
carthage
and
joplin.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
let
me
say
this,
i
don't
know
what
frisco
has
been
doing,
but
they
have
had
the
right
to
do
it
if
they
wanted,
in
other
words
it's
been
a
matter
of
their
managerial
discretion
and
not
a
matter
of
complying
with
a
congressional
mandate
set
forth
in
section
5(2)(b)
of
the
act
which
is
specifically
applicable
to
the
purchase
proceeding
before
the
commission.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
ordinarily,
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
ordinarily
a
restricted
certificate
as
one
its
features
requires
a
transportation
of
the
traffic
involved
on
rail
billing
and
at
rail
rates,
that's
just
one,
then
you
have
the
other
restriction
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
quite
frankly
i
will
have
to
leave
to
frisco
to
answer,
they
could
if
they
--
if
they
wanted
to
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
if
they
wanted
to
charge
motor
carrier
rates
that
is
no
problem,
the
motor
carrier
rates
(inaudible)
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
i
don't
know,
i
will
leave
that
to
frisco.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
i
have
to
be
completely
candid,
the
commission
has
issued
unrestricted
certificates
under
5,
which
we
specifically
say
is
beyond
their
authority
to
do,
and
i'm
certain
that
if
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
in
exceptional
circumstances,
it's
just
that
it
has
never
been
raised
in
these
proceeding,
now
of
course.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
don't
know,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
in
all
the
certificates
which
has
been
issued
to
rail
subsidiaries,
that
there
has
never
been
a
certificate
issued
which
didn't
contain
a
reservation
of
the
right
to
subsequently
do
something
about
it.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir
and
that
is
the
complete
answer
as
we
say
it
is.
at
frisco,
if
they
had
wanted
to
insist
that
they
had
the
right
to
conduct
an
unrestricted
operation,
what
bound
at
some
stage
or
another
this
proceeding
to
have
asked
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
decision.
the
court
has
never
done
to
this
day.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
and
i
think
that
the
court
below
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
you
end
up
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
frankfurter
with
two
alternatives,
either
you
hold
the
that
commission
issued
these
certificates
inadvertently
or
you
hold
that
there
is
no
other
holding
you
can
make,
that
they
conducted
some
sort
of
a
star
chamber
process,
never
going
on
the
record
and
never
giving
the
independent
motor
carriers
an
opportunity
to
come
before
them
and
state
their
views
and
by
that
star
chamber
process
reversed
the
only
written
decision
they
ever
made
in
these
finance
cases,
now
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
alternative
this
court
has
and
i
don't
believe
you
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
want
to
make
it
cleat
that
we
are
not
here
accusing
the
commission
doing
this
kind
of
thing,
it's
frisco
that
says
that
they
did
it,
and
of
course
the
other
alternative
i
spoke,
there
is
a
third
alternative.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
correct.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
because
sir
the
commission
certificates
are
issued
by
a
clerk
(inaudible)
called
the
section
of
certificates
which
at
that
time
and
even
today
is
up
there
grinding
out
those
pieces
of
paper
thousands
upon
thousands,
and
because
the
--
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
commission's
administrative
practice,
i
think
it's
short
of
what
it
ought
to
have
been
in
the
case,
(inaudible)
there
was
here
a
very
poor
liaison
between
the
proper
organizations
within
the
commission,
but
that's
the
way
i
explain
it,
that's
the
only
explanation
i
can
give
because
i
don't
believe
that
anybody
on
the
commission
for
example
went
and
whispered
in
somebody's
ear
in
the
section
of
certificates,
now
it's
true
we
said
in
these
finance
cases
that
we
are
going
to
issue
only
restricted
authority,
but
don't
pay
any
attention
to
that,
give
them
an
unrestricted
certificate,
i'm
not
accusing
the
commission
of
that.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
and
that
--
the
trouble
as
i
previously
pointed
out
in
the
district
court
decision
is,
they
cast
aside
in
that
find,
any
right
which
the
independent
motor
carriers
had
before
the
commission
and
just
almost
put
on
line,
they
were
careful
to
take
frisco's
rights
down
to
the
last
iota,
but
you
cannot
read
the
decision
and
escape
the
opinion
as
judge
moore
points
out,
that
they've
completely
overlooked
the
rights
of
the
independent
carriers
who
were
protesting
frisco's
applications
before
the
commission
finish.
they
never
had
a
chance.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well
i
think
they
said
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
said
it
rather
specifically
i
thought.
they
pointed
out,
and
it's
contained
in
171
on
the
record
here,
that
despite
the
tenancy
of
the
compliant
that
frisco
was
operating
illegally,
the
commission
issued
these
unrestricted
certificates
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
in
the
face
of
all
this,
the
commission
would
have
us
believe
that
the
purported
changes
were
made
as
a
result
of
clerical
error
and
later
it
said
that
what
the
commission
is
trying
to
do
is
limit
the
force
of
--
then
it
gets
in
line
with
the
present
policy
of
the
commission
and
use
a
claim
clerical
error
that
does
not
exist
to
justify
such.
now
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired
mr.
chief
justice,
except
i
wanted
to
take
one
minute
to
advert
to
justice
douglas'
question
on
the
watson
case.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
we
think
that
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
this
case
here
and
the
watson
case.
principally
the
watson
case
was
this.
watson
operated
over
approximately
85
routes,
with
respect
to
which,
as
far
as
about
65
of
them,
it
had
general
commodities
authority
and
authority
to
transport
dangerous
explosives.
watson
filed
an
application
with
the
commission
trying
to
fill
in
all
of
its
rights
so
to
speak.
it
said
it
wanted
to
handle
dangerous
explosives
to
the
other
18
and
19
points
as
to
which
it
didn't
have
authority.
during
the
course
of
the
watson
proceeding,
it
developed
that
there
were
four
government
installations,
very
close
to
watson's
operating
rights,
which
it
hadn't
asked
for
authority
to
serve,
and
watson's
counsel
said
right
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
we
would
also
like
authority
to
serve
both.
counsel
for
the
protesters
there,
before
the
commission
examiner
said
we
have
no
objection
to
that
broadening
of
the
application
so
long
as
watson
is
restricted
to
service
of
government
organizations,
the
satisfactory
(inaudible).
ultimately
the
examiner
issued
his
report
and
the
report
became
the
order
of
the
commission.
(inaudible)
certificate
was
issued
in
the
watson
case.
the
certificate
authorized
the
transportation
of
dangerous
explosives
as
well
as
general
commodities
to
these
four
government
installations.
but
watson
operated
under
that
certificate
for
four
years
and
then
without
any
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard,
such
as
has
been
afforded
to
frisco
in
this
case
time
and
time
again,
the
commission
simply
issued
an
order
for
purporting
to
revoke
watson's
right
to
serve
these
four
government
installations,
except
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
dangerous
explosives.
now
the
three
judge
court
in
the
face
of
that
record,
said
that
the
commission
couldn't
do
it,
and
court
affirmed,
and
of
course
it's
pretty
difficult
to
try
to
read
this
court's
mind
and
i
won't
try
to
do
it
except
to
explain
what
we
think
is
the
distinction.
first
watson
was
an
independent
motor
carrier,
and
there
was
no
question
in
that
case,
that
the
(inaudible)
had
no
application
to
that
watson
operation.
watson
was
an
entirely
different
category
to
start
with,
than
is
frisco
a
real
subsidiary.
second,
watson
had
been
given
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
with
respect
to
this
alleged
inadvertent
error.
the
commission
simply
issued
an
order,
said
your
certificate
is
revoked
here
is
a
new
one
and
third
as
it
seems
to
be
important,
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
sits
only
to
review
important
federal
question
as
this.
there
was
no
objection
of
watson
serving
these
four
government
installations,
in
the
transportation
of
both
dangerous
explosives
and
general
commodities
before
the
commission,
all
that
the
counsel
for
the
production
tried
to
assure
himself
up
with
this,
that
watson
wouldn't
serve
anybody
but
the
government.
so
i
think
this
court
must
have
known
when
the
matter
came
before
it,
before
happening,
that
if
it
had
gone
along
with
the
commission
and
upheld
its
correction
of
that
certificate,
watson
within
6
months
would
have
been
back
at
the
commission,
have
failed
an
application
to
provide
general
commodity
service
to
those
four
government
installations,
who
bear
in
mind
had
no
truck
service
whatsoever
and
would
have
been
authorized
by
the
commission
to
conduct
such
operation
and
so
in
addition
to
all
the
other
questions,
you
were
faced
with
the
question
of
is
this
an
important
federal
question.
thank
you.
