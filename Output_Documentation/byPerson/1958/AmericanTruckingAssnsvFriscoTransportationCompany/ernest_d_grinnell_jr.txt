mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
discuss
first
with
you
the
facts,
and
the
various
questions
that
have
come
up
during
the
comments
argued.
then
i
intend
to
discuss
briefly
this
5(2)(b)
question,
and
then
the
question
raised
by
the
commission
under
section
212(a),
and
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
close
with
a
discussion
of
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence.
there
has
been
handed
to
each
of
your
honors
a
map,
on
which
the
geographical
extent
of
the
operations
of
the
appellee
are
shown.
you
will
note
that
the
appellee
operates
from
the
(inaudible)
and
up
a
motor
carrier
system
that
covers
about
--
that
covers
seven
states
and
now
totals
approximately
3,400
miles.
of
these
3,400
mile
operations,
2,700
miles
are
operated
in
unrestricted
motor
carrier
service
of
the
type
that
has
been
discussed
here
today,
that
is
the
handling
of
motor
freight
on
motor
billings
directly
for
the
public.
this
system
was
gathered
together
largely
through
the
acquisition
of
previously
existing
independent
motor
carriers
in
the
latter
part
of
1938
and
the
early
part
of
1939.
the
four
cases
which
give
rise
these
appeals
are
only
four
of
many
acquisitions,
which
the
appellee
made
during
that
period.
you
will
note
that
they,
i
have
them
located
on
the
map
in
the
circle,
altogether
the
six
cases
which
were
considered
by
the
commission
are
designated
in
the
record
as
284
miles.
now
i
don't
know
the
exact
number
of
milage,
my
milage
has
been
dropped
when
the
two
cases
went
to
--
other
cases
went
out
of
this
case,
but
i
think
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
it
is
approximately
200
miles
that
is
involved
here.
now
you
will
note
from
their
location,
in
these
circles
that
their
importance
far
exceeds
their
mileage
because
if
we
no
longer
have
the
right
to
conduct
an
unrestricted
business
from
st.
louis
through
the
red
and
green
(inaudible),
hamm
and
cooper,
we
can't
reach
oklahoma
and
texas,
and
if
we
no
longer
have
the
right
to
operate
the
full
through
which
--
which
is
shown
in
yellow
in
unrestricted
service,
we
cannot
reach
memphis
from
kansas
city
and
consequently
we
are
left
with
the
sparsely
populated
areas
of
missouri,
so
that
their
importance
far
exceeds
their
size.
now
the
red
dots
shown
on
here
in
the
nature
of
key
points
are
the
key
points
which
were
included
in
the
commission's
order
which
the
district
court
has
enjoined.
the
major
key
point
restriction
that
we
--
under
which
we
operate,
outside
of
this
particular
order
is
that
we
may
not
handle
traffic
directly
for
the
public
on
motor
carrier
rates
between
memphis
and
st.
louis.
in
others
words,
if
we
--
if
someone
in
thomas,
mississippi
sends
this
traffic
to
us
destined
for
st.
louis,
we
may
take
it
only
as
far
as
memphis,
and
must
then
turn
it
over
some
other
truck
line
to
take
it
to
st.
louis,
we
cannot
handle
it
from
memphis
to
st.
louis,
but
that
restriction
was
placed
in
another
case.
now
you
note
the
dotted
line
down
the
river,
that
is
the
result
of
a
purchase
called
the
rider
purchase
where
the
commission
specifically
refused
to
authorize
us
to
engage
in
unrestricted
operations,
and
specifically
said
it
must
be
auxiliary
and
supplemental.
so
that's
our
restricted
operation,
the
balance
is
unrestricted.
now
it's
listed
in
the
appendix
in
our
brief
the
citation
of
those
cases,
and
i
might
note
that
in
none
of
the
other
cases
was
this
reservation,
which
is
present
in
the
four
cases
here
involved,
and
three
opinions
really,
was
this
reservation
included
in
the
commission's
decision.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
that
was
one
of
the
last
ones,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
we
got
at
that
time
when
we
were
considering
--
when
we
were
buying
the
right,
my
understanding
is,
i
was
not
with
the
company
then,
but
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
they
did
–
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
--
because
it
was
after
this
error
of
the
rock
island
case
really.
it's
the
last
one
and
they
were
getting
into
the
reason
that
we
just
don't
give
them
without
the
restrictions
anymore
except
in
unusual
cases.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
recall
any
specific
ones
other
than
that
they
were
generally
not
doing
it
at
that
time.
now
i
think
it's
informative
and
it
might
be
well
to
bring
it
up
right
at
this
point.
counsel
for
the
appellants
that
have
--
at
least
i
got
the
impression
that
they
didn't
bring
up
this
unrestricted
operation
that
we
have.
now
the
interstate
commerce
commission
noted
in
the
rock
island
white
purchase
which
gave
rise
to
rock
island
decision,
the
commission
said
this,
“as
previously
stated,
from
the
date
of
the
decision
in
the
barker
case,”
which
was
the
pennsylvania
railroad
subsidiary
and
which
is
referred
to
by
you
in
the
rock
island
and
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case,
“to
shortly
before
the
enactment
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
the
principles
there
recognized,”
that's
the
barker
principle,
“and
applied,
controlled
the
disposition
of
practically
every
rail-motor
acquisition
case.
however,
beginning
with
frisco
transportation
company
purchase
of
reddish,”
which
is
35
m.c.c.
132,
“and
continuing
until
quite
recently,”
this
was
march
4th
1946,
“the
practice
of
specifically
reserving
the
right
to
later
impose
such
restrictions
as
might
be
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
future
operations
under
the
acquired
authority
should
be
limited
to
the
rendition
of
service
auxiliary
to
or
supplemental
of
the
train
service
was
not
followed.
with
such
departure
from
the
former
practice
there
also
appears
to
have
developed
a
tendency
in
rail-motor
acquisition
proceedings
to
treat
the
barker
case
restrictions
as
geographical
or
territorial
only
in
their
intent
rather
than
as
substantive
limitations
upon
the
character
of
the
service
which
might
be
rendered
by
a
railroad
or
its
affiliate
under
the
acquired
right.”
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
your
honor
they
were
and
in
answer
to
a
specific
question
which
you
ask
about
the
adoption
or
about
the
existence
of
tariff
rates,
the
record
here
shows
and
i
think
it's
the
most
important
part
of
the
record,
it
contains
six
exhibits
one
covering
each
one
of
the
purchases
which
were
involved
before
the
commission.
now
the
--
in
each
one
of
those,
the
correspondence
between
the
appellee's
assistant
general
manager
and
the
commission
is
gathered
together.
shortly
after
these
finance
proceedings
came
out,
the
appellee
received
a
letter,
which
--
there
is
one
for
each
one
of
these
purchases,
saying
it's
been
approved,
undertake
the
adoption
of
the
tariff's
of
your
predecessor,
file
you
are
adoption
notices
and
your
powers
of
attorney
and
other
the
other
formal
matters,
we
replied
and
did
it.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
those
are
exhibit
10-a
covers
the
hamm
purchase,
it
beings
on
record
402,
exhibit
12-a
covers
cooper,
it
begins
on
433.
now
those,
we
may
take
the
exhibit
10-a
beginning
on
402
because
principally
there
each
one
follows
the
same
pattern.
now
and
so
that
--
the
adoption
was
done
then
and
there
and
the
compliance
orders
are
also
included
in
those
exhibits,
they
were
the
next
step.
now
there
is
one
question
about
these
compliance
orders
that
i
would
like
to
clear
up
while
i
am
on,
while
we
are
at
that
point
in
fact.
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
comment
upon
compliance
orders,
in
the
crescent
express
line
against
the
united
states,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
has
said,
“the
compliance
order
gave
opportunity
to
the
applicant
or
other
parties
in
interest
to
protest
its
conclusions.”
and
in
the
present
case,
the
actual
fact
was
that
the
other
people,
others
were
the
ones
who
brought
the
case
up
and
they
were
the
ones
who
brought
the
complaint
about
the
compliance
order.
now
it's
my
understanding,
i
of
course
am
not
old
enough
to
have
dealt
with
these
compliance
orders,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
in
a
pure
grandfather
case,
the
man
didn't
go
through
a
hearing
procedure,
he
went
in
and
filed
a
lot
of
a
bills
to
show
what
he
had
been
doing
prior
to
the
grandfather
date
and
then
he
got
his
compliance
order,
that's
it
and
that's
when
the
objection
came
up.
now
if
his
competitors
thought
that
what
he
had
applied
for
through
his
bills
and
what
the
commission
had
told
him
in
the
compliance
order
he
could
do
was
too
great,
too
much
authority
then
you
got
your
hearing
procedure
or
reexamination
of
his
data
or
documents
by
the
appeal
courts.
now
in
these
cases
in
each
situation
the
man
whom
we
were
purchasing
had
gone
through
the
initial
phases
of
his
grandfather,
true
but
he
had
not
yet
received
a
compliance
order.
and
then
we
purchased,
now
the
appellants
or
the
appellant
trucking
companies
that
appear
here
are
not
necessarily
the
people
who
appeared
in
opposition
to
those
finance
proceedings
and
i
might
add
that
it
is
impossible
by
any
intimation
that
the
people
who
did
appear
there
were
worried
about
us
having
an
all
out
truck
service.
it's
acknowledged
in
the
committee's
report
that
we
did
say
that
we
were
going
to
continue
that
business
and
in
addition
thereto
engage
in
the
handling
of
the
substitute
for
the
railroad,
of
the
railroad
freight.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
am
sure
that
it
does
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
am
sure
that
it
does,
but
i
couldn't
specifically
point
to
the
section
where
that
it
is.
those
applications
were
a
printed
form
and
they
had
a
lot
of
documents
and
data
attached
to
the
printed
form.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
provision
in
there
which
probably
doesn't
say
that
exactly
that
we
were
going
to
do
that
was
but
it
said
that
we
are
going
to
continue
the
operations
that
the
vendor
had
previously
conducted.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well,
these
are
not
in
chronological
order
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
if
your
honor
will
look
through
the
index
it
begins
on
402.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
correct.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
of
course
they
are
drawing
on
it
is
the
rock
island
case
and
here
it
did
not
survive.
now
the
only
hesitation
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
these
were
the
only
correspondence
that
we
had
with
them
and
this
particularly
one,
let's
see
now,
it
says,
in
the
event
the
transaction
authorized
by
the
order
had
been
consummated,
has
--
you
are
required
to
issue
and
file
and
post
for
public
inspection
an
adoption
notice
adopting
all
terms,
powers
of
attorney
et
cetera
filed
with
the
commission
by
or
behalf
of
the
selling
carrier,
i
think
that's
the
reason
probably
that
that
is
put
in
there.
now
the
only
explanation
that
i
can
give
your
honor
about
this
whole
situation
is
this.
if
you
will
note
the
four
cases
here
involved
are
division
5
cases
before
the
commission.
our
other
cases
are
division
4
cases
before
the
commission.
now
--
one
thing
that
has
constantly
occurred
to
me
is
that
the
members
of
division
5
thought
that
it
was
necessary
as
the
satisfaction
to
the
statute
to
include
this
proviso
that
the
members
of
division
4
did
not
so
construe
the
statute
and
consequently
when
the
certificates
were
issued,
they
were
not,
it
was
not
a
set
policy
to
always
fast
forward
that
reservation
into
the
certificates.
now
if
you
will
look
at
the
certificate
on
page
500
in
the
record
i
believe,
500
that
is
the
first
certificate
which
covered
the
hamm
and
cooper
operation.
you
will
note
the
first
thing
on
that
page
is
a
restriction
upon
the
operations
that
were
covered
immediately
prior
to
the
hamm
certificate,
they
are
on
the
previous
page
and
they
specifically
mentioned
that
it
was
being
--
it
was
a
railroad
operation
or
is
a
railroad
type
restriction.
and
yet
the
very
next
thing
which
is
the
hamm
purchase
certificate
did
not
include
any
restrictions.
now
there
is
one
another
item
in
these
exhibits
particularly
with
regard
to
hamm
and
cooper,
which
i
think
will
be
interest
to
your
honor.
it
is
a
quotation
from
the
ozark
common
carrier
application
which
appears
at
32
mcc
459.
now
frisco
transportation
company,
the
appellee
purchased
ozark
or
a
part
of
ozark,
and
after
they
had
conducted
the
purchase
and
the
commission
had
passed
it
for
it,
and
before
the
final
certificates
and
orders
i
think
had
been
issued,
there
were
two
or
three
intermediate
points
for
our
ability
and
authority
to
serve
was
not
clear.
so
the
ozark
common
carrier
application
was
reopened
for
the
purpose
of
considering
it.
now
at
page
414
of
the
record
this
appears.
it's
starts
on
the
bottom
of
page
413
and
its
excerpts
from
that
proposition
from
that
case.
now
in
--
the
commission
division
5
on
february
19th
1942
about
a
month
or
six
weeks
before
the
certificate
was
issued,
specifically
comments
on
what
we
got
in
hamm
and
cooper
and
there
is
no
intimation
that
there
was
any
restriction
upon
it.
now
if
your
honors
please
those
are
some
of
the
things
we
thing
must
have
brought
the
district
court
to
comment,
and
i
think
it's
more
in
the
nature
of
comment
that
the
commission
was
changing
their
policy
because
i
think
they
just
disposed
of
the
case
prior
to
making
that
comment
and
it
was
just
their
view
of
what
the
evidence
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
basically
that
is
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
have
told
some
of
the
members
of
their
staff
specifically
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
should
have
been
some
evidence
put
in
this
case
by
the
commission
as
to
the
manner
of
issuance
of
these
certificates,
who
issued
them,
by
what
authority
they
issued
them,
their
instructions,
what
they
did,
none
of
this
appears.
all
that
appears
in
this
record
surrounding
the
issuance
of
the
certificates
is
that
it
contained
in
exhibits
10-a
through
15-a
which
is
--
some
of
these
exchanges
of
correspondence
and
each
one
of
them
includes
a
quotation
from
some
other
case,
where
the
commission
commented
upon
the
rights
involved
and
with
the
--
indicating
that
they
were
all-out
or
unrestricted
rights,
and
the
compliance
orders
are
also
in
there
and
then
exhibit
16-a
draws
together
all
of
the
certificates
here
issued.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well,
they
apparently
felt
that
way
if
you
look
at
the
notice.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
say
the
commission
apparently
felt
that
way
if
you
look
at
the
notice.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
that
we
had
to
make
some
sort
of
an
explanation.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
may
i
just
at
this
point
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
reverse
the
order
of
my
argument
and
comment
upon
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
because
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
we
raised
before
the
district
court.
now
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
holds
that
the
certificate
were
inadvertently
issued,
not
the
compliance
orders,
although
they
do
comment
at
one
point
thus
if
the
error
occurred,
it
must
have
occurred
first
in
the
compliance
order,
but
they
find
that
inadvertence
existed
from
two
facts,
appearance
of
a
proviso
reserving
the
power
to
restrict
in
the
division
5
and
failure
of
that
proviso
to
appear
in
the
certificate
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
sir
the
--
that
was
the
second
step
of
our
case.
you
see
then
this
case
before
the
commission
and
in
the
order
here
is
really
a
two
step
order.
first
of
all
on
grounds
that
the
certificates
had
been
inadvertently
issued,
they
revoked
it
and
issued
in
there
instead
new
or
amended
certificates.
now
they
say
we
could
issue
these
and
then
go
into
the
rock
island
procedure
and
determine
what
condition
should
be
attached,
but
we
will
do
it
all
in
one
step
here.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
step
is
all
that
we
are
really
--
that
i
am
really
concerned
with
right
at
this
point,
and
that
is
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
on
those
two
facts
alone
to
find
that
inadvertence
existed
because
with
those
two
isolated
facts
certainly
it
is
permissible
to
infer
that
the
certificates
were
inadvertently
issued,
but
it
is
equally
permissible
to
infer
that
they
were
intentionally
--
that
the
omission
was
intentional.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
am
afraid
i
would
have
to
disagree
because
that
came
after
i
mean
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
division
5
of
the
commission
and
the
briefs
of
the
appellants
here
virtually
admit
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
because
the
division
5
in
considering
this
problem
included
--
apparently
saying
we
may
of
course
take
official
notice
of
the
administrative
practices
and
procedures
of
our
section
of
certificates
and
then
describes
the
procedure
by
which
the
certificate
is
issued.
now
that
particular
finding
was
a
very
important
subject
in
our
petition
for
reconsideration
of
that
order
and
that
language
was
dropped
from
the
commission's
report.
it
was
dropped
because
this
court's
ohio
bell
telephone
case
says
that
in
administrative
body
may
not
use
official
notice
in
that
way
and
then
finally
in
the
report
advise
the
parties
that
they
used
it.
the
actual
fact
here
is
that
if
there
had
been
evidence
of
inadvertence
which
we
have
been
called
upon
to
rebut
we
would
have
brought
in
evidence
to
build
this
record
of
with
--
of
rebuttal
evidence
now
in
the
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
think
this
mr.
justice
that
the
evidence
that
should
have
been
there
was
the
chief
of
the
section
of
certificates
describing
the
method
by
which
certificates
were
issued
and
the
authority
of
his
section.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
yes
he
did
and
i
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
yes
sir
--
now
i
should
perhaps
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
that
was
a
statement
if
your
honor
please
that
was
made
during
a
(inaudible)
hearing.
the
hearing
this
case
was
not
full
all
out
hearing
as
you
might
expect.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
we
were
told
to
appear
in
kansas
city
at
the
hearing
and
to
submit
evidence
in
connection
with
the
application.
now
our
principal
position
was
just
exactly
the
position
the
seatrain
took
before
that
case
came
here,
if
your
honor
will
recall
they
didn't
put
in
any
evidence
before
the
commission
when
their
certificate
was
attempted
to
be
changed
or
revoked
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
inadvertent.
so
we
filed
or
made
at
the
hearing
an
oral
motion
to
discontinue
the
proceedings.
and
in
support
of
that
motion
we
placed
in
the
record
or
we
put
on
the
stand
the
auditor
who
put
in
the
financial
data
to
show
the
financial
and
statistical
history
of
our
operation.
witness
(inaudible)
who
put
in
these
exhibits
10-a,
15-a
that
i
discussed
and
then
we
rested
and
the
hearing
examiner
said,
“well
aren't
you
going
to
put
something
else
in
here?"
and
then
during
that
colloquy,
this
statement
to
which
mr.
justice
whitaker
referred
was
made.
and
really
if
you
read
that,
you
get
the
impression
that
his
instruction
was
to
just
go
out
and
give
enough
information
because
we
are
going
to
put
on
restrictions.
there
never
was
any
inquiry
into
this
proposition
whether
or
not
the
certificates
were
inadvertently
issued.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
of
course
the
compliance
order,
the
language
of
the
compliance
order
is
at
a
session
of
division
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
division
5,
which
it
seems
to
me
if
we
cannot
rely
then
those
matter
have
been
considered
by
the
commission
when
they
are
proposed
that
way,
i
don't
know
what
order
we
can
rely
on
and
particularly
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
at
any
rate
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
are
going
to
find
that
the
certificates
were
inadvertently
issued,
they
must
have
evidence
to
support
that
finding
and
our
contention
is
that
they
did
not.
now
with
regard
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
exactly
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
they
were
all
hearing
examiners
your
honor
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
the
only
answer
to
that
i
can
give
to
you
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
at
that
time
the
existence
of
a
reservation
in
the
certificate
only
reserving
the
power
did
not
mean
that
you
could
not
conduct
all
out
motor
operations.
this
court's
rock
island
case
arises
over
a
similar
situation
where
the
time
is
pretty
much
the
same
except
that
their
certificate
was
issued
prior
to
ours,
and
they
conducted,
unbeknown
to
everybody
unrestricted
or
all-out
operations
despite
the
fact
that
that
proviso
reserved
the
power
in
the
commission
to
further
limit
or
restrict.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
the
full
commission
did
not
actually
put
it
in
until
december
1953
in
this
case
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
and
by
then
they
more
than
just
put
it
in,
they
put
in
the
additional,
they
put
in
the
five
conditions
similar
to
those
which
they
placed
on
the
rock
island
which
every
one
agrees
effectively
stopped
any
sort
of
operation
directly
for
the
public.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
that
if
your
honor
please
was,
that
we
may
--
we
reserved
the
power
to
further
limit
or
restrict
that.
now
the
restrictions
that
they
put
in
--
in
this
case,
in
exercising
that,
is
that
the
service
shall
be
--
to
be
performed
shall
be
limited
to
their
service
which
is
auxiliary
or
supplemental.
and
you
see
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
we
saw
this
provision
and
obviously
i
was
not
there,
but
at
the
time
it
appeared
in
those
original
division
5
report,
the
commission
had
never
construed
auxiliary
and
supplemental.
they
did
not
do
that
until
shortly
before
they
reopened
this
case.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
they
reserved
the
power,
but
auxiliary
and
supplemental
in
the
power
to
keep
it
that
way
had
never
been
construed
by
the
commission
to
mean
fully
auxiliary
and
supplemental
until
the
texas
&
pacific
case
in
1943.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
i
think
the
testimony
of
witness
english,
who
was
produced
at
a
request
of
the
examiner,
who
was
the
general
manager
of
the
company
at
that
time
this
hearing
was
held
and
really
was
the
father
of
it.
he
had
grown
up
with
it.
i
can't
recall
any
specific
statement
of
his,
but
he
does
testify
at
length
on
this
very
subject
as
to
why
they
didn't
do
anything.
and
my
recollection
is
that
his
conclusion
was
that
they
had
never,
they
hadn't
believed
at
that
time
that
it
meant
solely
auxiliary
and
supplemental.
in
his
testimony,
i
forgot
which
one
of
your
honors
asked,
perhaps
it
was
justice
black,
about
the
percentage
of
our
business,
the
testimony
witness
english
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
approximately
51%
to
50%
of
the
business
of
the
transportation
company
was
handling
sort
of
railroad
freight
as
a
substitute
for
the
railroad.
while
it
does
appear
in
the
record
i
am
advised
that
still
the
percentage
is
near
that.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
it
is,
but
the
nature
of
our
business
really
has
not
changed
much
since
the
hearing.
we
have
not
expanded
the
way
the
motor
carrier
industry
had.
of
course
there
is
--
none
of
that
can
be
in
the
record,
but
the
fact
is
that
that
the
other
people
operating
in
the
same
territory
have
expanded
greatly
and
frisco
transportation
company's
figures
that
appear
in
witness
essex's
testimony
are
fairly
representative.
i
think
that
we'd
probably
gone
down
a
little
bit
because
of
the
--
such
is
the
amount
of
freight
tenders
of
the
railroad
which
can't
be
used
or
handed
over
to
the
truck
company
has
reduced
through
the
years.
now
may
i
address
myself
to
section
5(2)(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act?
it's
our
position
that
the
language
of
that
proviso
does
not,
in
and
of
itself,
prohibit
the
commission
from
issuing
unrestricted
certificates.
it's
my
view
that
under
that
proviso
the
commission
must
make
these
findings
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
rock
island
case
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
against
parker,
but
that
it
is
not
required
to
restrict
the
rail
affiliated
truck
line.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
think
that
even
to
approve
an
auxiliary
supplemental
operation,
you
must
make
those
same
findings
–
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
--
findings
are
tied
to
the
railroad
applicant,
not
to
the
resolving
the
case.
so
i
think
that
they
got
to
make
them
no
matter
what
kind
of
an
operation
we
proposed
to
conduct
and
i
think
that
their
current
cases
where
they
are
using
an
unusual
circumstance
rule
that
they
originated
in
the
rock
island
case,
they
are
perfectly
sound
construction
of
the
statute.
we
have
no
dispute
with
that
at
all
and
as
i
understand
the
american
trucking
association's
argument
on
5(2)(b),
they
say
that
that
the
commission
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
issue
these
certificates,
therefore
they
were
void
ab
initio.
and
so
that
they
just
could
not,
all
of
our
certificates
really,
if
they
are
successful,
you
can
see
these
certificates
that
are
not
even
involved
in
this
case
would
no
longer
be
any
good.
and
there
they
have
been
completed,
there
has
never
been
any
inquiry
to
them,
never
been
any
intimation
that
there
was
any
error
in
those
certificates.
and
as
the
quotation
that
i
read
you
early
that
for
a
while
they
did
it
without
any
restrictions
in,
without
putting
these
restrictions,
and
these
certificates
were
issued
right
in
the
time
that
they
have
been
talking
about
between
the
time
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940
and
1946
when
it
was
approved,
when
they
said
that
to
our
(inaudible)
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
my
position
is,
justice,
he
said
that
the
compliance
orders
were
served
on
someone.
now
i
assume
that
that
since
they
bore
the
number
not
only
of
the
finance
cases
but
also
the
number
of
the
grand
--
of
the
purchase
case,
i
would
define
one
of
them,
there
is
a
compliance
order
on
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
i
think
they
must
give
notice
of
their
intended
action,
as
a
general
proposition
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
but
i
think
the
compliance
orders
here
were
noticed.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
the
compliance
order
is
entitled
mc89913
sub
number
1,
it
mentions
at
the
bottom
as
a
footnote
this
order
embraces
the
authority
applied
under
docket,
54
under
docket
number
so
and
so
john
b.
ham,
or
john
ham
doing
business
with
southwest
freight
line
purchased
by
the
applicant
named
there
in
pursuant
to
finance
docket
number
so,
approved
november
30th
1938.
now
i
assume
they
do
it
now
i
think
that
where
--
that
they
serve
their
orders
upon
all
parties
of
record
in
all
the
cases
involving
their
order.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
now
this
basically
says
that
he
is
checking
that
they
did
not
in
this
case
but
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
here
and
there
is
nobody
that
i
know
off
made
any
great
complaint
about
not
receiving
a
notice
until
after
we
finally
got
to
go
ahead
in
this
case.
we
were
behind
for
all
of
time
and
we
were
the
ones
that
were
making
the
claim
and
then
all
of
sudden
they
out
of
the
district
court
decided
that
they
would
enjoin
the
commission
orders,
a
lot
of
claims
that
it
had
never
been
and
there
is
no,
found
nothing
wrong
with
their
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
and
they
replied
all
the
way
through
and
then
all
of
sudden
they
had
to
take
the
advantage.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
it
would
be
perfectly
alright
to
put
it
in
there
something.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
that
would
be
perfectly
alright
with
me.
the
proposition
is
if
your
honor
please
that
the
--
here
is
the
thing
that
you
run
into
now
and
i
have
tried
to
trace
this
back
from
my
own
information,
if
you
look
at
15
mcc
318,
19,
20
where
these
original
two
or
three
of
these
original
cases
appear,
you'll
see
that
before
the
interveners
appeared
to
stanley
clay,
now
in
the
discussion
as
to
his
position,
his
position
was
that
we
did
not
have
the
corporate
authority
to
engage
in
the
motor
carrier
business
and
that's
the
only,
as
i
recall
the
only
thing
that
the
examiner
discussed
as
his
contention.
he
wasn't
complaining
that
we
were
been
engaged
in
the
all-out
truck
business
down
in
the
little,
as
mr.
justice
whitaker
pointed
out,
the
eight
mile
segment.
it
was
the
first
one
we
had.
this
idea
of
the
construction
that
mr.
beardsley
now
contends
for
what
was
in
section
213(a)(1)
was
never
even
heard
of.
i
mean
the
contentions
were
never
made
and
i
assume
that
mr.
clay
got
a
copy
of
this
order
and
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
see,
they
let
him
go
and
that
was
it.”
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
supply
it
for
the
record,
if
the
record
still
exists
as
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
i
am
not
well
enough
acquainted
with
their
recordkeeping.
if
they
have
that
information
i
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
have
it
submitted
by
letter.
but
in
connection
with
5(2)(b)
we
also
think
that
this
reason
would
indicate
that
the
commission
must
have
the
file
in
the
proper
regulation
of
the
transportation
system
as
a
whole
to
issue
to
these
unrestricted
certificates
upon
the
proper
findings.
the
ones
that
are
--
unfortunately
the
current
cases
where
they
are
still
doing
had
not
been
reported
yet.
and
mr.
beardsley
who
is
appearing
in
those
cases
has
maintained
the
same
contention
he
makes
here
today.
in
all
of
those
there
appears
to
be
a
reluctance
of
the
independent
trucking
industry
to
handle
what's
called
peddle
freight.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
frisco
transportation
company
is
handling
some
of
that
peddle
freight
for
other
truck
lines
if
they
don't
want
to
handle.
you
got,
you
--
many
little
towns
where
they'll
have
no
service
if
they
don't
know
all-out
common
carrier
service
if
they
don't
get
it
from
the
rail
affiliated
carrier.
in
this
case
it
connects
with
diaz,
arkansas,
they
made
an
exception
because
we
couldn't
go
out
there
only
on
substitute
service,
right,
we
just
couldn't
--
we
had
to
find
in
the
operation
and
so
they
allow
us
to
do
it.
in
our
rose
certificate
in
the
same
case,
they,
after
inquiring
into
the
matter,
they
thought
that
it
was
best
since
we
had
as
a
result
of
the
206
application,
authority
to
go
on
one
direction,
we
could
get
purchase
authority
to
go
in
the
other.
now
that
one
was
that
disconnected
to
our
operation,
but
i
think
that
on
that
question
it's
absolutely
necessary
that
the
have
this
discretion
and
i
think
this
court's
opinion
in
rock
island
and
in
the
barker
case
both
are
cast
entirely
in
permissive
terms
as
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned
and
both
emphasize
that
the
commission
must
have
this
discretion.
now
as
i
said
i
think
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
whitaker,
i
think
they
must
make
the
findings
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
case
it
is
or
what
kind
of
an
operation
is
proposed
but
i
think
that
after
having
made
those
findings
in
the
principal
one
or
the
last
one
is
not
what
--
we
want
to
unduly
restrain
competition;
the
other
one
is
maybe
able
to
use
this
trucking
business,
trucking
operation
in
connection
with
or
coordination
with
its
railroad
that
after
they
have
made
those
that
it
is
perfectly
proper
for
them
under
the
statute
to
issue
an
unrestricted
certificate.
now
their
position
in
the
rock
island
case
is
that
they
must
have
some
unusual
circumstance
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
they
have
done
that,
but
if
you
look
at
our
blake
and
our
reddish,
in
those
purchases,
they
gave
us
the
unrestricted
rights.
so
perhaps
they
didn't
feel
that
way
then,
that
was
before
rock
island
and
it's
in
that
period
that
they
comment
upon
in
rock
island
where
they
didn't,
they
were
not
as
a
practical
matter
including
these
reservations
in
the
certificate
and
that's
when
these
certificates
were
issued
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
also
backed
it
up.
this
court
has
commented
upon
it,
and
i
think
this
is
the
only
thing
that
you
can
find
no
matter
how
far
you
search
in
commissioner
eastman's
statement
and
then
purpose
of
the
proviso
and
that
was
discussed
in
the
rock
island
case,
and
also
in
the
barker
case
it's
in
the
foot
note.
and
your
honors
also
have
examined
the
congressional
record
and
when
senator
wheeler
introduced
the
bill
or
brought
the
bill
on
before
the
senate,
there
is
nothing
in
his
discussion
that
would
indicate
any
intention
of
congress
to
completely
restrict
the
right
of
the
commission
to
issue
an
unrestricted
certificate
and
the
same
thing
was
represented
(inaudible)
who
handled
the
bill
in
the
house,
it's
not
there
either.
so
most
of
what
you
find
as
you
delve
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
thing
is
negative
proposition.
as
a
matter
of
fact
commissioner
eastman's
statement
was
after
the
bill
had
been
entered,
it
was
in
1939
when
they
were
considering
amendments
to
the
bill
and
if
--
the
bottom
connection
was
the
(inaudible)
amendment
information.
now
one
point
i
think
i
might
bring
upon
that,
just
after
commissioner
eastman
testified,
the
general
counsel,
the
american
trucking
associations
testified
at
those
same
hearings
and
that
he
commented
--
in
commenting
on
the
(inaudible)
amendment
he
said
that
this
thing
is
not
strict
enough
for
us,
we
think
some
language
ought
to
be
added,
which
would
make
it
--
without
question
if
they
could
not
engage
in
this
direct
motor
carrier
business,
and
that
he
even
suggested
the
words
that
would
have
to
be
added
to
the
(inaudible)
amendment
in
order
to
accomplish
that
purpose
and
of
course
is
suggesting
in
the
(inaudible)
amendment
both
went
out
when
commissioner
eastman
assured
them
that
they
were
exercising
a
certain
amount
of
restrain
on
these
carriers.
now
in
connection
with
section
212(a),
and
particularly
the
watson
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
beyond
question
that
what
the
commission
did
here
was
to
revoke
certificates,
that's
the
language
of
their
opinion,
their
report,
it's
the
language
of
their
order,
it's
the
language
of
their
finding,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
when
they
changed
the
form
of
the
operation
authorized,
they
have
revoked
it.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
if
the
change
that
was
accomplished
by
that
procedure
resulted
in
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
rice
then
you
would
not
have
(inaudible)
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
there
has
to
be
a
revocation.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
but
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
beyond
to
what
actually
happen
to
the
certificate.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
now
the
commission
said
in
their
smith
brothers
case,
which
this
court
has
occasion
to
cite,
and
which
is
cited
i
think
probably
in
all
the
briefs
and
in
the
opinion,
that
a
certificate
is
the
final
act.
they
may
issue
order
upon
order,
but
when
they've
issued
the
certificates
that's
the
final
act
and
it
compares
to
a
final
judgment
and
then
the
next
thing
that
they
said
in
the
smith
brothers
case
and
it
gives
rise
to
this
entire
inadvertent
(inaudible)
that
they
seem
to
have
assumed
in
connection
with
certificates,
they
said
this
should
not
been
taken
as
meaning
that
if
--
that
we
cannot
revoke
the
certificate
issued
as
a
result
of
fraud
or
mistake
or
one
issues
in
error.
now,
it's
our
view
that
--
and
they
say
no
such
problem
is
involved
here,
so
that
what
they
said
in
the
smith
brothers
case
and
the
thing
that
has
been
used
as
a
basis
of
all
their
inadvertent
cases
was
open.
and
they
should
not
have
permitted
that
overt
statement
is
control
the
result
in
subsequent
cases.
now
when
they
came
to
watson
they
had
a
real
pure
case
where
they
were
claming
they
had
made
an
error
and
so
in
that
case
also
they
said
we
do
not
have
to
be
bound
or
to
consider
the
212
procedures
and
so
they
without
notice
and
hearing
revoked
the
certificate
and
the
district
court
condemned
it.
now
the
revocation
there
was
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
commodities
that
could
be
hauled
to
specific
points,
here
is
a
complete
change
in
service.
so
i
think
we
come
within
the
watson
principle
as
far
as
the
fact
that
it
is
a
reduction
and
i
see
no
reason
why
in
the
statute,
why
there
should
be
a
different
rule
on
revocation,
applying
to
railroad
affiliates
than
applied
to
independent
truck
liners,
and
that
seems
to
be
the
basic
distinguishing
factor
that
all
of
the
appellants
point
to
and
that
is
the
fact
that
here
you
have
real
a
rail
affiliated
carrier.
now
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
they
had
no
notice.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
that
makes
a
difference,
but
the
district
court,
and
the
three
judge
court
in
the
watson
case
specifically
said
now
--
now
i
think
i've
quoted
it
for
your
honors,
actually
it's
a
very
short
one,
they
said
counsel
for
the
commission
argues
that
the
order
of
august
25,
1953
merely
corrects
the
clerical
error
in
the
certificate.
even
if
the
court
were
to
assume,
that
the
commission
has
authority
to
correct
clerical
errors
without
notice
of
hearing,
the
result
in
this
case
would
not
be
different,
because
it
is
the
holding
of
the
court,
that
the
order
of
august
25th
is
more
than
the
correction
of
a
clerical
error,
and
it
is
an
attempt
made
contrary
to
section
212
to
revoke
a
certificate
duly
issued.
now
i
take
that
to
the
issued
to
mean
one,
that's
within
the
commission's
power
because
otherwise
they
could
say
well,
we
just
do
it
inadvertently.
so
that
i
think
the
court
a
consideration
in
the
watson
case,
took
into
consideration,
this
contention
about
notice
and
hearing
and
they
removed
that
from
the
case
and
said
it
still
can't
be
done.
now
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
that,
that
may
have
been
said
was
this
court's
decision
in
(inaudible)
against
state
freight
line,
where
the
state
of
illinois,
as
a
part
of
their
enforcement
procedures,
had
a
suspension
provision
in
their
statute,
and
this
court
held
that
a
state
could
not
do
that,
because
the
power
to
revoke
a
motor
carrier
certificate
authorizing
and
covering
an
interstate
operation,
can
be
revoked
only
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
only
upon
the
grounds
of
willful
violation
of
law.
now
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
--
now
i
did
not
find
this
quotation
until
after
my
brief
was
prepared,
but
when
senator
wheeler
discussion
section
212
on
the
floor
of
congress,
he
said
this.
"criticism
was
directed
against
the
power
of
revocation,
thus
conferred
upon
the
commission.
it
was
suggested
that
the
effect
is
to
put
the
future
of
countless
operators
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
commission,
which
might
act
arbitrarily,
and
that
the
penalties
elsewhere
provided
or
ample
to
secured
compliance."
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
“however,
that
the
state
commission
people
who
had
testified
indicated
that
the
commission
should
have
some
power
to
revoke
because
that
power
was
the
most
effective
compliance
provision
that
they
could
possibly
have.
that
they
--
you
could
fine
people
and
you
could
do
everything
else,
but
if
you
could
not
revoke
their
certificates,
you
couldn't
enforce
the
law
properly,
and
that
has
been
their
experience
in
the
states.
now
i
suggest
that
the
indicia
of
what
construction
should
be
placed
on
section
212,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
you
know
this
is
american
trucking
association
makes
no
contention
about
this
inadvertent
issue
certificate,
because
i
don't
know
how
you
could
advice
a
client,
that
his
certificate
was
good,
if
you
always
have
to
have
hanging
over
your
head,
the
possibility
that
there
has
been
error.
now
the
commission
says
in
our
campbell
sixty-six
case
that
we
didn't
have
to
go
behind
the
certificate
and
it
was
no
duty
for
us
to
go
behind
then
and
make
sure
that
everything
was
just
right
when
we
got
them.
if
they're
fair
up
on
their
face
and
they
fairly
represent
what
was
in
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
ends
the
applicant
or
the
certificate
of
carrier's
duly.
now
for
instance
i
can
imagine
that
campbell
sixty-six,
one
of
the
appellants
here
handled
the
matter
of
contract
performance,
(inaudible)
substitute
rtes
we
well.
well
let's
suppose
in
a
--
in
the
case
where
they
were
replying
for
new
authority,
this
fact
that
were
going
to
handle
substantive
service
for
us
came
up,
and
that
--
so
a
provision
was
put
in
their
certificate,
limiting
them.
this
is
service
which
is
auxiliary
to
and
supplemental
to
train
services
o
this
(inaudible)
san
franscisco
railway.
well
now
to
remove
that
will
certainly
not
be
a
revocation,
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
say
that
the
commission
couldn't
do
that.
the
district
court
here
doesn't
say
they
cannot
correct
clerical
error.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well,
could
your
honor
give
me
the
page
on
that?
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
that's
why
i
wanted
it.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
yeah
it's
talking
about
campbell
case.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
oh!
i
thought
it
was
division
5,
reporting
--
reopen
case.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
no,
the
campbell
case
here
that
report
is
in
the
complaint
case
brought
by
campbell
sixty-six
is
the
first
name
in
the
complaint
and
several
other
motor
lines
alleging
that
we
were
violating
(inaudible).
this
report
was
reversed
by
the
full
commission,
in
46
instances
and
what
the
commission
said
is
that
we
could
rely
upon
those
certificates.
we
were
not
on
the
face
because
the
certificates
authorized
unrestricted
operation,
we
were
not
engaged
any
unauthorized
operation
but
to
say
would
not
upset
or
set
aside
the
reopening
order
which
is
entered
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
case.
the
campbell
sixty-six
--
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
well
and
i
think
also
the
question
of
whether
or
not
certificates
were
inadvertently
issued,
i
can't
recall
the
exact
quote
but
i
think
they
refer
to
that
in
their
paragraph
like
there's
a
constant
reference
both
in
the
report
in
this
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
appellant
because
this
division
5
opinion
on
campbell
case
when
actually
the
decision
of
the
full
commission
was
that
we
think
that
(inaudible)
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
my
view
of
that
is
they
held
as
all
of
the
authority
say
that
general
power
to
correct
clerical
error,
the
fact
that
section
212(a)
interstate
commerce
act
severely
limits
their
power
to
accomplish
a
revocation
of
a
certificate
expect
on
certain
grounds.
our
position
is
that
they
could
not
correct
that
error
in
the
certificate
if
it
amounted
to
a
revocation,
and
we
think
that
is
what
the
district
court
has
held
and
that's
what
the
district
--
three-judge
court
in
the
watson
case
held.
in
another
words,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
interest
of
confidence
and
certificates,
congress
has
limited
the
power
of
revocation
and
they
limited
it
to
the
extent
that
it
must
--
the
grounds
for
revocation
must
be
a
willful
violation
of
the
statute
or
a
regulation
thereon
and
consequently
whenever
the
correction
of
a
clerical
error
reaches
the
point
that
it
constitutes
a
revocation,
then
it
is
prohibited.
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
then
i
think
(inaudible)
denver,
missouri
and
they
use
denver,
colorado,
i
think
they
can
revoke
that,
that's
(inaudible)
mr.
ernest
d.
grinnell,
jr.
no
i
think
they
could
correct
the
error
and
it
would
not
amount
to
a
revocation.
the
example
i
have
in
mind
is
any
carrier
might
have
authority
from
texas
through
oklahoma
to
springfield,
missouri
and
this
could
have
happened
in
our
case.
we
build
our
system
from
that
and
when
we
got
the
ozark
purchase
and
some
and
one
or
two
other
purchase,
we
went
from
springfield
to
st.
louis.
now
had
they
put
springfield
illinois
in
there
so
that
was
disconnected
part
up
here,
it
gave
us
no
rights
to
packet
with
what
we
have
already
had
to
reach
st.
louis,
i
think
then
that
probably
would
not
be
a
revocation.
thanks.
