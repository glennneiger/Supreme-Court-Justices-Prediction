justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
in
the
207?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
take
a
position
that
the
commission
cannot
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
that
order
at
issue
to
preserve
the
power
of
the
commission,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it's
true
to
all
four?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
there
were
two
other
that
are
not
involved
in
this
case
where
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion
little
differently
than
perhaps
the
state
did.
i
thought
that
the
premise,
the
majority
of
district
court
was
that
the
commission
--
the
evidence
was
showed
that
the
commission
had
not
acted
(inaudible)
that
the
certificate
had
not
--
issued
incorrect
and
therefore
212
came
into
play.
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
a
third
interested
party
competition
has
any
standing
to
be
heard
when
a
compliance
order
issues?
i
tried
to
find
out
about
that,
or
ascertain
was
(inaudible)
â€“
there
does
seem
to
be
a
provision
for
a
hearing,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
i
was
wondering
what
the
situation
was
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
it
could
not
fairly
be
said
that
the
competitor
would
have
an
opportunity
at
that
stage
to
assist
the
compliance
order
in
the
form
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
both
came
down
1939
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
will
you,
before
you
sit
down
will
you
address
yourself
to
justice
whittaker's
question
on
how
you
tie
in
the
bennet
certificate,
that
the
inadvertency
in
a
case
of
these
others?
i
don't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
that
view,
the
reservation
order
would
be
meaningless?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
got
no
notice
of
the
compliance
orders?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
you
speak
with
great
assurance
on
that
5(2)(b)
but
commission
as
a
matter
of
practice,
i
think
it
has
some
flexibility
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
is
decided
--
the
american
truckers
case
certainly
doesn't
decide
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
the
commission
ever
issued
an
unrestricted
certificate
under
5(2)(b)
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
been
asserting
the
authority
to
do
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
the
record
you
are
here
on
is
that
the
reopening
in
these
proceedings,
the
examiner
finds
that
this
was
all
unintentional
and
inadvertent,
division
5
says
the
same
thing
and
the
full
commission
says
the
same
thing
and
the
district
court
says
no
they
are
all
wrong,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
are
those?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
original
application
for
permission
to
acquire
shows
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
you
intended
to
operate
on
an
unrestricted
basis?
justice
john
m.
harlan
sure
that
it
does?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
fundamentally
the
factual
premise
is,
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
the
commission
in
representing
that
this
was
an
inadvertency
on
its
part
in
issuing
unrestricted
certificates
is
really
not
acting
in
good
faith
that
is
underlying
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
it?
you've
got
to
go
to
that
length?
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
it's
not
in
the
record
why
do
we
have
to
be
(inaudible)
doubt
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
something
can
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
agreed
to
by
you
gentlemen
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
these
people
did
have
notice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
it
seems
--
we
all
remember
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
oh
excuse
me
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
it's
volume
43,
mcc
page
651.
that's
the
division
5
report
under
reopened
proceeding.
it's
not
put
in
the
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
in
the
record.
i
tried
to
find
it
in
the
record,
but
i
got
the
report
from
the
library.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
thought
it
was,
am
i
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
they
said
that
as
far
as
being
subject
to
penalties
or
criticism
for
having
relied
on
unrestricted
certificate
that
was
wrong
and
the
question
of
what
limitation
would
be
imposed
was
deferred
to
a
later
stage.
