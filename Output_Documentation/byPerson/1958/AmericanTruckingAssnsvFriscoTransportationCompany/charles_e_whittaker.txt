justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
the
fifth
division
at
the
same
time
didn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
actually
why
it
took
1939
to
1953
in
this
administrative
phase
14
years?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
ginnane
does
the
acquisition
orders
say
that
the
conditions
would
be
placed
in
the
certificates
or
only
that
they
might
be
depending
upon
what
the
commission
later
concluded?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
true
mr.
beardsley
that
every
acquisition
order
in
a
rail
subsidiary
acquisition
contains
this
language
that
the
commission
may
insert
a
condition?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
the
area
involved
here
is
physically
around
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
joplin
to
missouri
is
about
8
miles
and
from
joplin
over
to
miami
it's
about
what,
15
miles.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
you
got
another
section
way
over
on
the
top
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
have
they
ever
issued
any
order
in
an
acquisition
proceeding
without
reserving
the
right
to
condition
a
certificate?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
significance
of
that
to
me
is
that,
be
a
complete
answer
to
the
argument
that
this
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
then
do
we
explain
that
after
your
objections
were
filed
in
1941
saying
that
frisco
(inaudible)
and
that
protest
is
pending
before
the
commission
one
year
later
it
issues
the
unqualified
certificate.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
say
(inaudible)
exercise
the
right
reserve
is
what
you
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
not
the
judge
in
parker
rely
heavily
at
least
among
other
things
upon
the
specific
statement
made
by
the
hearing
examiner
at
the
beginning
the
hearing
saying
it
is
not
what's
in
the
certificate,
it
is
what
desirable
and
i
want
him
permission
to
sustain
his
order
of
what's
desirable,
now
those
aren't
exactly
the
words
but
that's
(inaudible)
now
judge
hoffman
relied
on
that
did
he
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
made
no
findings.
he
just
found
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
were
not
supported
by
the
record,
didn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it
makes
those
findings?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
