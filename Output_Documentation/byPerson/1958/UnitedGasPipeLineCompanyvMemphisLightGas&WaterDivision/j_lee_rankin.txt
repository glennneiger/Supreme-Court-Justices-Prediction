mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
mobile,
a
natural
gas
company
may
file
schedules
changing
its
rates
unless
it
has
a
specific
agreement
in
regard
to
the
amount
of
those
rates
although
it
has
reserved
the
right
in
its
agreement
to
file
such
schedules
under
the
statute
subject
to
the
commission's
approval.
the
united
gas
company
pipeline
filed
such
schedules
on
september
30th,
1955,
materially
increasing
the
rates,
changing
the
rates
that
it
had
under
a
contract.
the
commission
found
that
it
had
the
power
to
file
such
schedule
to
change
rates
by
reason
of
the
terms
of
its
contract
and
the
reservations
that
it
had
made
under
that
contract
for
that
power
and
rejected
the
motions
of
the
respondents
to
reject
such
filed
rates
which
motions
were
on
the
ground
that
mobile
prohibited
the
filing
of
such
rates
unless
there
was
an
expressed
agreement
to
the
specific
level
of
the
rates.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
action
of
the
commission
i
might
say
first,
was
taken
after
the
rates
were
filed
and
suspended
after
the
30-day
period,
all
of
the
rates,
except
those
that
were
only
industrial.
the
rest
of
them
were
suspended
in
accordance
with
section
4
(e)
for
the
five
months
period
and
then
they
were
subject
to
refund
under
that
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
right
to
file
even
though
they
accepted
the
construction
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
of
the
commission
of
a
contract
between
the
parties
and
that
the
reservation
did
provide
for
such
filing.
the
court
held
that
unless
there
was
an
agreement
to
the
specific
rate
that
was
filed,
that
mobile
prohibited
the
filing
and
therefore,
reversed
the
decision
of
the
commission.
now,
the
agreement
that
is
involved
is
set
out
on
page
7
of
our
brief
and
it
is
crucial
to
this
controversy.
we
think
that
in
light
of
the
commission's
action
and
the
court
of
appeals'
acceptance
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
of
that
construction
or
finding
by
the
commission
that
this
court
should
accept
that
it's
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
case.
and
therefore,
the
agreement
should
be
found
like
the
court
--
as
the
commission
found
it
and
that
filing
should
be
accepted
by
this
court.
but
the
language
and
the
question
of
the
defect
of
a
language
is
raised
as
one
other
points
by
the
respondents
and
we
therefore
would
like
to
call
to
your
attention
partially.
the
language
that
is
of
particular
importance
in
this
question
is
the
fourth
line
“or
any
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
on
file
with
the
federal
power
of
commission.”
it's
a
question
of
what
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
where
any
on
file
with
the
federal
power
of
commission
mean.
the
united
contends
that
that
means
not
only
the
rate
schedules
that
were
filed
on
a
particular
day
of
this
agreement,
but
any
that
would
be
filed
superseding
or
taking
their
place
under
the
provisions
of
the
act,
section
4
(d)
and
that
that
where
the
respondents
said
that
they
will
pay
which
is
in
the
first
line,
for
the
gas
delivered
shall
be
paid
for
by
the
buyer
under
the
seller's
rate
schedules
and
such
superseding
schedule.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
contract
was
a
part
of
the
tariff-service
agreement
rate
schedules
that
the
commission
developed.
it
started
back
in
1940,
but
later
largely
after
1945
--
1948
and
the
order
144
that
it
promulgated
at
that
time.
and
the
concept
of
that
program
of
rate
schedule
was
to
have
the
rates
set
out
in
a
tariff
schedule
and
then
in
the
service
agreement
that
was
made
with
all
of
the
contracting
customer,
they
would
refer
to
that
rate
schedule,
but
the
rates
could
not
be
set
up
as
such
in
the
service
agreement
with
the
idea
that
if
they
put
them
in
the
service
agreement,
there
would
be
a
tendency
to
make
individual
rates
in
every
case.
and
the
purpose
of
order
144
and
that
system
of
rate
program
was
to
try
to
have
the
rates
effective
as
to
areas
and
not
as
to
individuals
customers
and
the
purpose
behind
that
was
to
get
away
from
the
discrimination
and
preferences
that
had
been
discovered
throughout
the
various
industry
hearings
that
the
commission
had
dealt
with.
and
they
thought
by
having
the
rates
in
the
separate
tariff
and
the
changes
in
the
rates
in
separate
tariffs,
then
the
service
agreement
would
be
made
with
the
customers
and
refer
to
those
rates
would
not
have
a
separate
individual
rate
for
every
separate
customer
and
each
customer
would
not
have
to
look
to
every
other
service
agreements
to
see
whether
someone
else
in
similar
situation
had
a
better
deal
than
he
did
so
he
could
raise
the
question
of
preference.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
mobile
contract
was
distinctly
different.
and
there
were
some
18
contracts
of
that
type
that
were
filed
with
the
commission
and
those
had
a
specific
rate
and
no
provision
in
the
service
agreement
or
the
contract
for
any
change
whatsoever.
now,
this
contract
started
out
before
1948
with
a
--
an
agreement
between
the
parties
for
service
and
it
also
had
detailed
escalation
provisions
which
are
known
in
the
trade
as
provisions
for
price
increases
based
upon
this
difference
in
tax
rates
that
are
assessed
or
cost
of
living
or
anything
of
that
type.
and
they
were
specific
in
contemplating
flexible
rate
structures
that
will
be
adjusted
from
time
to
time
as
changes
in
cost
developed.
now,
in
order
to
get
away
from
some
of
these
problems,
the
preference
and
discrimination
and
these
escalation
provisions
--
the
escalation
provisions
that
they
developed
in
the
industry
and
the
difficulty
the
commission
had
to
determine
what
the
rate
structures
were
and
how
the
discriminations
occurred
and
who
they
affected,
the
commission
decided
to
try
to
develop
this
tariff-and-service
agreement
program
and
they
tried
started
out
in
1940
with
it
the
war
and
interrupted
it
and
it
was
until
1948
that
they
could
really
develop
and
put
it
into
effect.
but
for
example,
here
is
a
group
of
contracts
and
there
were
six
files
of
this
type
that
for
united
alone,
the
gas
pipeline
involved
in
this
case.
now,
in
order
to
try
to
find
out
if
you're
a
rate
expert,
what
your
particular
customer
might
be
involved
in
with
regard
to
whether
some
customer
in
the
same
group
of
area
and
type
of
the
same
rate
in
fact
would
be
entitled
to
and
so
that
you
would
find
out
whether
the
discrimination
of
preference
against
to
your
customer.
and
you
would
have
to
go
through
all
of
these
and
try
to
find
out,
compare
all
these
contracts
and
if
that
involve
not
only
the
rate
itself
but
the
time
of
delivery
and
the
place
of
delivery
and
different
differentials
that
would
be
involved
in
negotiation
and
the
amount
of
gas
that
was
furnished.
then
you'd
also
have
to
look
at
the
supplements
which
for
certain
rates
and
provisions
of
that
type,
were
replaced
and
would
have
to
go
through
all
of
that
kind
of
procedures
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
situation
was
that
you've
raised.
now,
it
was
so
bad
that
with
the
--
the
panhandle
eastern,
they
developed
gas
shortage
and
it
was
a
question
of
how
they
were
going
to
supply
all
of
these
customers
and
what
their
relationship
should
be
to
eliminate
the
discrimination
and
preferential
treatment
that
would
be
involved
if
they
didn't
treat
them
on
a
fair
basis.
so,
the
commission
had
that
problem
to
determine
how
to
handle
prior
to
1948
when
they
involved
this
tariff-and-service
agreement
system.
and
in
trying
to
deal
with
that,
they
found
many,
many
preferences
within
discriminations
that
had
developed,
that
had
not
come
to
light
before
that
at
all,
but
as
soon
as
the
shortage
developed,
then
the
customers
all
came
and
said,
“well,
how
this
happened
that
my
situation
is
like
this
other
one
and
that
was
comparable?”
and
they
had
to
go
through
the
whole
system
and
reallocate
to
eliminate
the
preferences
and
discriminations
that
had
developed.
and
there
were
--
there
was
another
case,
a
similar
kind
where
they
discovered
it
only
after
5
(a)
hearing
the
discriminations
and
preferences
that
occurred.
now,
under
this
tariff-and-service
agreement
system,
we
have
a
file
like
this
that
the
customer
or
a
rate
expert
can
look
at.
and
he
can
determine
and
see
what
the
schedule
is
in
one
place
above
the
tariff
provides
for
the
rates
and
then
there
is
--
at
the
back,
a
listing
of
every
customer
and
what
rate
it
is
sold
out
and
then
there's
a
type
of
service
agreement
that
is
set
out
in
the
tariff's
schedule.
that
is
the
only
service
agreement
that
the
pipeline
can
use
to
sell
his
gas
unless
he
gets
special
permission
on
a
regulation
from
the
commission
and
can
show
a
reason
why
the
service
agreement
should
be
different
for
this
particular
sale.
and
you
can
see
what
difference
that
make
the
way
the
expert
turn
at
the
back,
he
can
see
what
other
customers
that
are
comparable
sold
out,
he
can
turn
to
this
tariff
schedule
and
he
can
turn
it
to
the
service
agreement
and
he
can
find
out
exactly
what
his
customer
is
getting,
what
he
should
get
in
order
to
be
fairly
treated
along
with
other
comparable
cases.
now,
that
is
basic
to
the
problem
in
this
case.
first,
however,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
--
what
mobile
held.
as
we
understand
mobile,
it
did
not
at
all
that
there
had
to
be
any
agreement
to
a
specific
rate
in
order
to
file
under
4
(d)
or
4
(e).
what
we
believe
mobile
held
was
just
this,
that
it
did
not
set
aside
contracts
and
if
you
had
a
contract
that
provided
that
your
rate
was
--
i
think
it
was
ten-seven-tenth
cents
the
file
in
cubic
feet
in
that
case,
and
you
have
no
provision
for
a
change
of
that
rate
and
you
had
it
for
10-year
period
that
the
act
did
not
say
you
had
any
right
to
change
it.
that's
entirely
and
solely
what
that
case
held.
the
case
also
held
that
you
could
have
ex
parte
rates
and
that
if
you
--
as
we
read
it,
if
you
had
any
provision
for
changes,
you
go
back
to
the
contract
law
separate
apart
from
the
act
and
if
under
contracts,
you
have
a
right
to
make
a
change,
you
still
have
that
under
the
act.
the
act
did
not
add
anything
to
it
except
the
right
of
review
in
order
that
the
commission
could
protect
the
public
interest
under
4
(d)
and
4
(e).
one
further
thing
we
read
in
to
the
act
is
that
of
4
(d)
and
4
(e),
the
test
of
what
is
lawful
is
the
same
as
under
5
(a)
in
that
--
that
the
same
structure
and
they
have
to
be
read
together.
commission
so
interprets
it
and
so
applies
it.
it's
also
a
question
of
--
there
are
some
question
raised
in
the
case
as
to
whether
there's
a
different
rule
applied
and
whether
there's
an
advantage
to
the
consumer
if
you
forced
the
examination
of
the
rate
under
5
(a).
now,
you
recall
that
4
(d)
and
4
(e)
is
an
entirely
different
structure.
it
provides
for
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
rate
fixing
and
the
rates
can
be
filed,
the
schedule
of
rates
under
4
(d)
and
4
(e),
there
has
to
be
a
notice
as
this
court
said
in
mobile
and
then
the
commission
can
consider
during
that
period
of
time
after
the
filing
of
notice
whether
or
not
with
the
showing
that's
made,
the
rate
should
be
suspended
or
should
be
allowed
to
go
into
effect
and
they
go
in
to
effect
at
the
end
of
30
days
if
the
commission
does
not
act.
and
they
go
in
to
effect
that
this
court
said
in
mobile
because
of
the
contract
between
the
parties
or
because
the
gas
company
files
a
rate
and
they
do
not
going
to
affect
because
of
the
act
itself.
then
after
that
happens,
the
commission
may
suspend
the
rates
and
set
a
hearing
and
that's
what
it
did
in
this
case.
and
during
that
hearing,
under
its
regulations,
it
requires
that
the
burden
fall
upon
the
--
the
person
who
files
the
rates
to
prove
that
they
--
the
proposed
rates
are
not
unjust,
unreasonable,
unduly
discriminatory
or
unduly
preferential
and
that's
the
test.
and
in
effect,
the
commission
always
applies
that
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
--
the
rates
are
lawful,
applies
them
back
against
the
structure
of
rates
before
and
determines
whether
or
not
under
that
test,
they
are
the
lowest
rates
that
will
make
a
fair
return
plus
the
cost
of
doing
business.
and
it
is
construed
as
a
pin
point
as
distinguished
from
a
general
area
of
rates
that
might
be
fixed.
well,
that's
what
we
think
that
mobile
means.
now,
the
experience
of
the
industry
was
that
except
in
rare
cases
like
mobile
made
such
contracts
that
i
just
referred
to,
the
industry
recognized
there
had
to
be
some
flexibility
to
rates.
by
the
nature
of
the
industry,
there
had
to
be
some
type
of
long-term
contracts
because
the
investments
were
very
great
in
these
long
pipelines
over
the
country
and
it
required
large
engagement
of
capital.
it
also
required
some
permanency
to
the
relationships
with
the
distributors
because
they
involved
themselves
in
substantial
investments
to
provide
this
service.
so
in
light
of
that,
contemplation
of
long-term
agreements
between
the
parties,
there
had
to
be
--
it
was
recognized
there
had
to
be
some
provision
for
flexibility
in
rates
to
take
care
of
the
different
costs
and
different
levels
of
cost
of
doing
businesses,
cost
of
all
kinds
of
materials
and
labor
changed
from
time
to
time.
there
also
had
to
be
some
kind
of
a
provision
that
would
encourage
capital
to
invest
in
this
industry
and
provide
the
necessary
funds
for
expansion
as
the
country
grew
and
needed
the
development
of
additional
pipeline
carrying
capacity
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
distributor's
needs
for
the
various
suburban
developments
that
have
been
characteristic
of
this
country
from
before
the
war
period
--
before
it
interrupted
in
ever
since
to
very
rapid
manner.
now,
there
have
been
substantial
rate
increases
asked
by
these
companies.
in
every
case,
the
commission
has
suspended
the
rates
and
set
them
for
a
hearing
in
order
to
look
at
the
consumer
interest
and
seeing
if
the
rate
was
proper
and
lawful
under
the
test.
but
i'm
here
to
say
that,
i
think
this
court
under
its
decisions
in
the
past
and
in
this
case,
must
be
interested
as
they
access
first
in
the
consumer.
that
the
consumer
also
has
the
interest
in
the
ability
of
these
companies
to
perform
their
contracts
and
to
meet
the
demands
of
this
country
in
its
growth
and
if
they
cannot
continue
to
receive
the
capital
and
attract
capital
that
is
needed
for
the
growth
by
getting
a
fair
return,
then
the
country
is
hurt,
the
consumer
is
hurt
and
that
is
part
of
this
picture
that
we
must
look
at
in
considering
this
case.
the
most
important
element
of
this
case
to
the
commission
is
the
effect
that
it
has
upon
the
structure
that
it
has
created
of
these
separate
tariff
and
separate
service
agreement
structure
of
rates.
i'll
tell
you
why
that
is.
no
agency
of
government
has
enough
money
to
do
all
the
jobs
that's
given
to
it
by
congress
and
time
after
time,
this
court
has
seen
that
it
has
the
ability
to
only
do
so
much
of
that
job.
so
that,
whatever
funds
it
has,
if
it's
going
to
regulate
properly
and
in
the
interest
of
the
country,
it
has
to
use
to
the
greatest
advantage.
and
any
system
of
rate
structure
that
is
as
much
as
possible
self-enforced
and
self-regulatory
that
it
puts
up
sign
posts
and
warning
signs
to
the
customers
and
the
public
generally
of
what
--
of
whether
discriminations
which
are
prohibited
by
this
act,
undue
discriminations
and
undue
preferences,
any
place
that
you
can
have
those
sort
of
the
customer
can
come
along
and
say,
“here,
how
did
this
happen?
they
can't
do
that
to
me.”
instead
of
the
commission
have
to
dig
it
up
through
a
labyrinth
of
papers
and
before
we
had
a
situation
where
there
were
some
8,000
pages
of
these
contracts
as
against
some
388
pages,
that's
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
this
tariff-and-service
agreements
program
of
rate
structure
developed
as
contrasted
with
the
old
contract
system.
now,
it's
argued
by
the
respondents,
well,
this
whole
situation
can
be
taken
cared
of.
you
can
still
file
under
4
(d)
and
have
it
heard
under
4
(e)
if
you
get
an
agreement
and
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
an
agreement
on
the
rate
from
everybody.
there
shouldn't
be
too
much
trouble
about
that,
but
i
have
tried
to
carefully
examine
this
and
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
get
the
agreement
unless
the
parties
are
in
rather
considerable
parity
as
to
their
bargaining
positions.
now,
you
must
keep
in
mind
under
4
(d)
and
4
(e),
the
rates
are
suspended.
there
is
a
refund
provision
except
as
to
industrial
and
i
will
cover
that
in
a
moment,
but
otherwise,
those
rates
are
paid
all
during
the
interim.
under
5
(a),
if
the
rate
is
established
there,
it's
only
prospective.
it
can't
cover
the
back
period.
now,
you
take
the
distributor
who
doesn't
want
to
expand
his
operation,
is
satisfied
with
the
--
with
the
gas
that
he
is
getting,
there
is
every
interest
in
the
world
for
him
to
not
agree
to
anything.
because
he's
says,
it's
their
contention,
you
go
under
5
(a)
at
that
point,
you
can't
file
under
4
(d)
and
if
it
takes
2
years,
3
years,
18
months,
whatever
you
can
chase
it
down
to
and
it's
been
as
much
as
six
years
to
have
a
5
(a)
hearing.
let's
say
you
can
get
them
cut
down
further
18
months,
during
that
18-month
period,
while
the
cost
of
doing
business
is
going
up
with
the
gas
pipeline
and
all
the
cost
of
labor
and
living
and
materials
and
so
forth,
the
commission
can't
do
a
thing
about
it.
it
can
only
make
a
rate
that
starts
from
the
day
that
that
hearing
into
it
fixes
it.
it
can't
even
go
back
to
the
dates
where
they
started
the
hearing
and
fixed
the
rate.
so,
you
would
never
get
an
agreement
with
the
distributing
company
and
that's
the
kind
of
situation
unless
you
wanted
to
extend
this
operation.
now,
you
can
trade
out
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
possibly,
the
fact
that
you
got
additional
gas
and
wants
to
have
another
development,
you
could
take
care
of
and
other
factors
of
that
kind
if
you
can
find
it,
but
in
every
case,
you
couldn't
even
find
those.
in
some
cases,
the
distribution
company
would
be
a
better
trader
than
others
then
what
will
you
have?
you
will
have
the
to
follow
that
has
no
reason
to
trade
out
if
you
make
some
agreement
of
any
kind
or
very
little
and
finally
does
and
you
file
under
4
(d)
and
4
(e),
you
will
have
the
one
that
has
reason
and
he
makes
a
different
rate
and
you
will
have
all
kinds
of
rates
involved
all
over
the
place.
and
then
you
will
have
to
go
under
a
4
(e)
hearing
to
try
to
straighten
out
all
those
preferences
and
discriminations
that
have
been
built
by
this
old
contract
method
of
arriving
at
rates.
and
it
is
--
will
be
very
destructive
of
trying
to
protect
the
consumer
interest
and
trying
to
have
this
picture
uniform.
not
that
everybody
pays
the
same
rate,
but
everybody
that's
in
the
same
area
or
group
where
there
isn't
a
good
reason
for
him
to
pay
a
different
rate
gets
the
same
rate.
and
it
does
help
the
commission
by
the
people
in
the
industry
working
at
it
to
get
rid
of
this
discrimination
better
than
any
other
idea
that
has
been
now
developed.
now,
there
is
another
--
in
regard
to
industrial
rates,
i
would
like
to
cover
that
matter.
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
the
suspension
of
industrial
rates
as
such
if
the
rate
is
set
as
to
industry,
there
is
no
provision
for
suspension.
if
it
covers
both
industry
and
other
rates,
then,
the
commission
has
always
taking
position
that
it
is
a
suspendable
rate
and
the
greatest
portion
of
the
gas
that's
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
is
sole
suspendable,
not
non-suspendable
rates.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but,
there
is
no
provision
for
suspending
those
that
are
called
industrial
only.
now,
that
is
an
important
factor,
but
it
isn't
anything
like
it
just
appears
to
be
claimed
in
response
brief
and
i
think
they
must
misconceived
it
in
the
way
they
have
urged
it
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
any
industry
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
practicalities
of
it
are
that
there
are
several
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
are
seven
companies
engaged
in
only
industrial
rates.
they
amount
at
the
present
time
to
approximately
2%,
i
think
a
little
less
than
2%
of
the
whole
jurisdictional
structure
of
rates.
so
that
approximately
98%
of
the
rates
are
suspendable
jurisdictional
rates
and
only
2%
are
these
that
are
non-suspendable.
now,
i'll
tell
you
another
thing
about
those.
why
does
anybody
buy
that
kind
of
a
rate?
the
commission
has
urged
for
years
almost
since
the
act
was
passed
in
1938
that
they
changed
this
to
make
those
rates
suspendable
and
if
the
league
of
municipalities
and
some
of
the
industries
would
come
forward
and
help,
i'm
certain
they'd
get
a
change,
but
there's
a
good
reason
why
at
least
the
industries
don't.
you
take
the
pacific
northwest
that's
referred
by
--
to
--
by
response
in
their
brief
and
you
will
find
that
there
was
a
rate
of
two
cents
per
--
per
term
and
it
was
proposed
to
increase
that
rate
to
two-and-a-half
cents
per
term
for
these
various
industries.
the
suspendable
rate
was,
as
i
recall
three
cents
and
it
was
proposed
to
increase
it
to
three-and-eight-tenths.
now,
the
toll
in
the
industry
that
had
bought
the
two
or
that
was
going
to
increase
to
two-and-a-half,
could
pay
during
the
non-suspension
period
at
the
increased
rate
and
be
way
ahead
of
paying
the
suspendable
rate
and
that's
apparently
true
throughout
the
industry.
now
i
don't
want
to
represent
this
always
through
because
i
haven't
searched
the
whole
picture
as
to
whether
it
all
fits
that
way,
but
it
looks
like
it
--
that
is
the
picture
and
i
can
readily
understand
why
anybody
that's
buying
gas
on
that
kind
of
a
basis
doesn't
come
in
and
urge
---
that
be
suspendable
because
what
he
is
doing,
it's
just
like
when
you
buy
insurance
or
any
other
commodity,
you're
buying
a
different
commodity
and
you're
getting
a
better
rate
because
you
don't
have
the
suspendible
provision.
he
takes
the
risk
of
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
get
a
price
increase
and
--
in
many
and
most
cases
he
would
have
opportunity
to
take
the
suspendible
provision
at
the
same
time.
and
he
chooses
deliberately
and
purposely
to
make
the
other
type
of
contract
because
he'd
better
off
and
he's
got
a
cheaper
cost
for
his
gas
even
though
it's
not
suspendible
during
that
period.
now
throughout
this
growth
of
this
industry
and
it
has
been
rapid,
it
has
been
recognized
that
there
has
to
be
a
flexible
rate.
there
has
to
be
some
provision
or
changes
and
modifications
of
the
rate
structure
as
the
pipelines
and
distribution
systems
and
other
gas
services
people
developed
and
have
greater
needs
in
the
community,
and
also
to
take
care
of
the
costs
of
doing
business
and
practically
without
exception,
they
always
provide
it
for
this
escalation
clause
as
i
have
described
it.
now,
the
commission
determined
when
it
developed
in
1948,
this
rate
structure,
the
tariff-and-service
agreement,
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
these
escalations
provisions
and
a
part
of
that
was
that
there
would
be
--
there
was
a
recognition
in
the
industry
that
with
those
clauses,
generally,
the
customer
could
not
come
in
and
resist
or
object
to
the
proposed
rates
at
the
hearing
because
he'd
already
agreed
to
him.
he
got
--
the
provision
in
the
contract.
so,
the
commission
was
going
to
eliminate
them
entirely
in
144
proceeding
and
united
objected
to
that,
and
said
that
they
thought
that
would
be
a
change
in
their
substantive
rights.
and,
the
commission
said,
it
was
not
trying
to
change
substantive
rights
in
that
proceeding
which
is
a
regulation
proceeding.
it
wasn't
a
place
for
--
it
should
be
changed
in
substantive
rights
and
they
provided
that
there
could
be
a
reservation
of
the
right
under
certain
conditions
to
change
the
rate
and
make
a
filing
under
the
provisions
of
section
4
(d)
and
by
that,
they
also,
by
the
order
number
144,
they
generally
eliminated
the
escalation,
but
they
expressly
provided
for
this
provision
that
they
couldn't
revive
their
rates
and
it
would
be
subject
to
commission
review.
now,
the
commission
when
it
reviews
these
rates,
is
not
arbitrator
or
deciding
a
controversy
between
the
pipeline
and
its
distribution
company
as
private
parties.
it's
deciding
what
in
the
public
interest
is
a
lawful
rate
and
it
was
applied
the
statute
for
that
purpose.
so,
it
isn't
in
any
way
acting
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
trying
to
determine
what
the
best
rate
is
for
these
two
companies
to
pay
each
other.
of
course
this
court
has
said
that
mustn't
the
primary
interest
of
the
statute
termed
by
congress
is
to
keep
in
mind
the
consumer
that
he
is
the
primary
interest.
and
so,
in
passing
in
4
(e)
or
5
(a),
as
i've
told
you
the
commission
applied
exactly
the
same
principles
and
standards.
it
has
to
determine
as
a
regulatory
body
for
this
in
the
public
interest
as
a
lowest
reasonable
rate
as
lawful
that
can
be
applied
and,
that's
his
function
and
that's
what
it
does.
so
that
--
and
one
other
thing
i
would
like
to
cover
and
i
want
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
and
that
is,
in
regard
to
the
independent
producers.
suggestion
is
made
that
the
commission
is
not
acting
as,
maybe
it
should
or
in
the
best
faith,
in
regard
to
the
independent
producers.
now,
i
want
to
tell
the
court
upon
careful
inquiry
to
the
commission
that
i
have
been
advised,
they
are
acting
under
the
philips'
case,
there
is
no
question
may
be
accepted
and
followed.
they're
following
the
city
of
detroit
to
do
it
and
they're
trying
as
rapidly
as
they
can
to
meet
the
problem
of
the
regulation
of
independent
producers.
there
isn't
any
question
as
this
court
--
court
well
recognized
in
the
philips'
decision
that
there's
got
to
be
regulation
of
that
level
in
order
to
protect
the
consumer
interests,
otherwise
we
just
keep
on
spiraling
up
in
that
point,
but
the
problem
has
been
great.
they
have
over
11,000
balances
of
independent
producers
that
they
have
suspended.
they're
trying
to
work
them
through
as
fast
as
they
can.
they
have
increased
their
force
50%.
they've
gotten
approval
from
the
budget
to
do
that.
why
don't
they
increase
it
more?
it's
impossible
because,
it
takes
lawyers,
great
experts
and
engineers
and
people
of
that
kind
who
have
some
knowledge
to
help
them
with
their
work
and
they
recruit
them
as
fast
as
they
can.
now
they
hope
that
at
least
by
1961
and
they're
working
at
it
as
fast
as
they
can,
they'll
have
that
out
of
the
way
and
they
looked
forward
to
the
system
like
this
of
the
tariff-and-service
agreement
structure
of
regulation
in
that
area
as
soon
as
they
can
get
on
top
of
the
situation
that
way,
so
that
it
will
help
to
regulate
itself
in
the
same
manner.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
will
make
it
very
clear
that
there
are
cases
where
under
the
act,
it
is
impossible
as
the
commission
construes
it
to
make
refunds
and
those
are
the
limited
cases
of
less
than
2%
that
involved
industrial
rates.
to
that
extent,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act
as
the
commission
construes
it
for
a
refund
of
those
rates
that
are
not
properly
although
initiated
they
are
--
they
are
found
later
to
be
unlawful.
now,
our
brief
shows
that
the
claim
of
the
mississippi
valley
is
not
correct
as
to
the
amount
of
gas
that
it
buys
on
industrial
basis
when
it
claims
67%.
we
point
out
that
there
is
some
27%
in
one
year
and
it's
down
to
6%
but
there
still
is
a
fact
that
as
to
the
2%
of
the
regulated
rates
or
jurisdictional
rates
in
the
country,
there
is
no
provision
for
refund.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
they
don't
call
your
attention,
however,
to
the
fact
that
they
have
a
provision
for
automatic
escalation
as
to
everyone
of
these
contracts
in
mississippi
valley
so
that
if
the
rate
is
raised
to
them,
they
pass
it
on
immediately
under
their
contract
to
the
industry
customer
purchaser.
now
that
doesn't
protect
the
consumer,
i
want
that
clearly
understood.
the
consumer
doesn't
get
it
back,
but
it
does
put
them
and
that's
--
if
they
have
been
frank
about
that,
they
would
have
shown
the
court
that
there
is
obvious
reason
why
they
wouldn't
care
too
much
what
the
--
the
rate
whether
or
not
their
new
rates
were
filed
as
long
as
they
had
a
provision
for
automatic
escalation
in
their
contract.
now,
i
was
trying
to
point
out
yesterday
that
although
there
is
no
provision
for
that
refund,
the
industrial
buyer
buys
at
a
cheaper
rate
so
that
he
can
figure
that
even
though
i
pay
an
increased
rate,
i
still
get
it
a
lot
cheaper
than
i
--
if
i
bought
the
susependable
rate
which
is
also
available
to
him
in
pacific
northwest.
i
don't
know
that
is
available
in
all
cases.
i
didn't
examine
that
as
i
tried
to
tell
the
court
but
i
know
in
pacific
northwest,
it
was
available.
they
had
both
rates
available
to
industrial
buyers
and
they
deliberately
bought
the
cheaper
rate
because
it
was
--
they
took
the
chance
and
they
were
still
better
off
on
the
increase
and
if
they
bought
the
suspendable
rate
where
they
would
get
the
refund.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
i've
checked
that
carefully.
now,
of
course,
the
commission
has
asked
that
it
be
given
that
power
even
as
to
that
2%
and
it
has
asked
to
repeal
it
over
the
years.
congress
has
seen
fit
not
and
the
history
indicates
that
these
are
short
term
contracts
and
that
the
congress
at
the
time
in
speaking
about
it,
felt
that
it
was
not
a
particular
problem.
we
set
up
that
legislative
history
but
the
commission
has
still
felt
well,
even
2%
we
ought
to
try
to
care
of
but
we
haven't
been
able
to
persuade
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
they're
well
able
to
take
care
of
themselves.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they're
powerful
industry
people
generally,
they
make
individual
contracts,
they're
usually
for
short
term
and
they
have
stand-by
provisions
for
oil
or
coal
or
other
provisions
because
most
of
them
are
uninterruptible
that
is
the
service
can
be
stopped
in
order
to
take
care
of
people
at
home
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
they
could
do
a
better
job
myself.
i
think
that
they
would
have
to
look
at
what
they
say
to
the
congress
in
order
to
say
exactly
but
they
have
asked
it
time
after
time
congress
seem
fit
not
grant
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
refund
goes
back
to
the
customers,
disposed
of
it.
it
goes
back
to
distribution
company
and
as
i
said
to
the
service
station
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
law
requires
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
assure
you
that
it
does.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
have
been
advised
that
there
are
cases
where
it
has.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
you
asked
me
that
before
in
the
city
service
case
and
i
answered
the
best
i
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
know
it
goes
back
to
distribution
companies
because
the
commission
orders
it
and
sees
that
it
does.
whether
it
goes
back
to
the
consumer
is
something
else
and
i
can't
assure
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
houston
case.
it's
been
referred
to
particularly
this
houston
case
as
an
example
of
where
it's
inconsistent
with
our
position
and
that
is
not
correct.
we
treat
that
on
page
26
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote
and
we
point
out
specifically
that
the
problem
was
this.
the
service
agreement
is
required
by
the
regulations
to
be
set
out
in
the
form
--
a
form
to
be
set
out
in
the
tariff
schedule
and
in
this
they
have
some
language
to
the
effect
that
it
would
be
as
the
buyer
and
seller
have
agreed
upon
the
rates
and
which
are
set
forth
here
in
below.
so
there
was
the
form
and
it
said
has
set
forth
here
in
below.
now,
the
reason
the
commission
wouldn't
prove
that
was
that
they
construed
it
would
give
the
buyer
to
the
seller
the
opportunity
to
have
a
different
provision
for
everyone
of
their
service
agreements
because
of
the
saying
which
are
set
forth
here
in
below.
and
they
specifically
said
they
couldn't
do
that
because
it
would
take
away
this
principle
they
were
fighting
for
and
have
held
for
all
the
way
through
in
this
terms
and
service
agreements
program
where
the
--
the
rates
for
certain
class
of
service
and
area
are
to
be
uniform
and
without
any
preference
and
discrimination.
