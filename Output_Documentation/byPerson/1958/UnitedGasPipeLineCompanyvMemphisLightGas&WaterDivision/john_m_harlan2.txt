were
those
services
being
(inaudible)
which
just
means
as
i
remember
the
time
in
the
mobile
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
my
question
is,
was
there
--
as
there
was
in
the
mobile
contract,
a
special
rate
as
distinguished
from
the
rate
that
was
prescribed
in
the
ordinary
tariffs
that
were
en
banc.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
mind
giving
me
that
reference
again?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
mistaken
in
considering
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
holds
that
section
4
procedures
are
not
available
at
all
except
in
the
single
instance
where
there
is
an
agreed
contractual
rate
involved
in
filing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
sole
scope
under
their
view
that
the
section
4
(e)
proceeding
--
section
4
(e)
procedures
would
have?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
i
understood
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
been
trying
very
hard
to
follow
your
argument
and
i
want
to
see
if
i
get
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
cut
through
always
what
you're
saying
is
that
absent
the
contract,
there
was
no,
right
no
statutory
right
to
any
for
section
4
proceeding
at
all
and
that
what
the
parties
had
sought
to
do
here
is
by
contract
to
supersede
and
impose
upon
the
commission
an
administrative
procedure
which
is
not
found
in
the
statute.
that's
your
argument
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
which
means
in
to
refine
it
a
little
bit
with
the
--
you
say
there
would
be
no
right
on
united's
part
--
on
the
part
of
the
united
here
to
file
its
proposed
rate
change
absent
the
so
called
consent
in
the
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
does
it
change
the
rate?
it
wasn't
a
proposal,
it
was
a
change
rate,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
couldn't
rate
a
contractual
change
rate
but
it
could've
been
--
it
could've
been
an
ex
parte
change
rate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
opinion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
that's
the
way
you
read
mobile.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
did
not
meet
--
the
agreement
in
mobile
was
an
agreement
for
a
specific
contract
rate
that
was
the
last
for
a
fixed
term,
for
10
years.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
mobile
--
what
united
was
trying
to
do
in
that
case
to
abrogate
that
contract
by
resorting
to
rights
which
it
claimed
it
had
under
the
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
it
could
not
abrogate
the
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
it
sought
to
supersede
ex
parte
contractual
agreement
which
united
had
entered
into.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
that
the
congress
accept
the
commissions
(inaudible)
and
they
made
adjusting
their
rates
under
section
4
is
certainly
a
refund
for
the
--
would
they
be
arguing
now
that
nevertheless,
the
suppliers
can
only
operate
under
section
5
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
--
that
would
be
so
in
quite
in
respect
of
this
clause,
isn't
it?
