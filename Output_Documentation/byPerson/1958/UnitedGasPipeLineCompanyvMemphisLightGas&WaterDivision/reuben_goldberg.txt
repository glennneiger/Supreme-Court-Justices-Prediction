mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
reemphasize,
if
i
may,
for
a
moment
what
mr.
morrow
has
just
said.
i
want
to
reemphasize
that
mississippi,
a
contract
purchaser
of
natural
gas
from
united
gas
pipeline
company
has
a
contract
with
united
for
the
purchase
of
natural
gas
for
a
specified
term
of
years
at
a
specified
price.
the
fact
that
the
price
is
specified
in
the
contract
by
reference
to
another
document,
a
rate
schedule
in
accordance
with
a
format
prescribed
by
the
commission's
regulations
to
provide
an
easy
means
for
the
public
of
locating
the
rates
involved
and
for
the
staff
of
the
commission
in
locating
it,
does
not
make
that
rate,
we
submit,
any
less
a
specified
contract
rate.
the
rates
specified
by
reference
to
the
rate
schedule
is
every
bit
as
binding
upon
united
and
upon
mississippi
as
was
the
price
in
the
mobile
contract.
the
petitioners
say,
however,
that
there
is
a
material
difference
between
the
mobile
contract,
and
the
contract
with
mississippi,
and
the
contracts
it
has
with
the
other
pipeline
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
difference
they
argue
lies
in
this
effective
superseding
rate
schedule
provisions
that
innocent
little
phrase.
that
provision
they
say,
implies
an
agreement
on
a
rate
change
procedure
a
reservation
by
united
of
its
right
unilaterally
to
file
a
change
in
the
contract
rate.
and
they
say,
“that's
all
we
need
under
the
mobile
decision
to
make
the
filing
a
valid
filing
eligible
for
filing
under
section
4
(d)
of
the
act,”
but
we
submit
the
provision
does
not
mean
what
they
claim
for
it.
the
provision
as
the
words
given
its
ordinary
made
make
clear,
it's
only
explicit
recognition
that
in
a
regulated
industry
the
rate
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
is
subject
to
the
paramount
power
of
the
commission
to
review
it
and
to
modify
it
while
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
the
legal
effect
of
that
language,
is
to
make
certain
that
when
the
commission
in
the
exercise
of
its
paramount
power
reviews
the
rate
and
determines
that
it
is
either
too
high
or
too
low
depending
what
the
case
maybe
that
the
seller
and
the
buyer
are
both
equally
bound
to
continue
to
buy
and
sell
gas
under
that
contract
under
that
new
rate.
thus,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
am
not
getting
right
to
that
if
i
may
get
it
in
to
--
in
the
order
my
argument
will
take
only
a
moment.
the
mississippi's
contract
we
say
is
therefore,
exactly
like
the
contract
in
the
mobile
case,
because
what
is
explicitly
stated
in
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
provision
was
implicit
in
the
mobile
contract.
as
the
court
recognized
in
mobile,
the
commission
has
the
power,
the
paramount
power
to
review
that
rate
and
to
change
it.
and
under
the
law,
united
would
be
obligated
to
sell
at
that
rate
and
mobile
would
be
obligated
to
purchase
at
that
rate
because
that
modified
rate
under
the
law
is
therefore
the
effective
superseding
rate
precisely
what
the
provision
in
the
contracts
here
involved
talks
about.
now,
the
petitioners
contend
that
this
construction
that
we
put
on
that
language
reduces
it
to
surplusage
because
they
say,
if
you
construe
with
the
way
you
argue,
it
only
says
what
the
law
is,
but
the
provision
not
only
says
what
the
law
is.
it
prevents
a
claim
of
illegality
or
impossibility
that
might
be
otherwise
have
been
advanced
by
either
of
the
parties
if
a
rate
ensued
out
of
the
exercise
of
the
commission's
paramount
power
that
perhaps
they
didn't
care
for.
and
it's
not
an
uncommon
thing
to
find
in
contracts
provisions
that
do
no
more
than
state
what
the
law
is
because
they
serve
the
very
useful
purpose
of
precluding
contentions
that
might
otherwise
be
advanced
and
a
provision
that
serves
such
as
purpose
we
submit
is
not
surplusage.
i
would
venture
to
say,
and
certainly
my
experience
is
pretty
limited
in
that
respect,
but
i
would
venture
to
say
that
if
we
can
have
a
dollar
for
every
contract
that
there
is
in
this
country
that
contains
a
provision
that
does
nothing
more
than
state
what
the
law
is
for
the
very
purpose
i've
indicated,
i
think
we
have
a
pretty
large
sum
of
money
perhaps
even
large
enough
to
make
dent
in
the
national
debt.
we
submit
that
you
can
read
that
language
in
the
contract
over
and
over
again
and
it'll
be
searched
in
vain
for
evidence
of
an
agreement
on
a
rate
change
procedure
or
a
reservation
on
the
part
of
united
unilaterally
to
file
a
rate
change
in
the
contract
rate.
there
isn't
any
reference
in
the
provision
to
section
4
(d).
there's
no
reference
of
the
provision
to
section
5
(a).
there
is
no
reference
in
that
provision
to
anything
that
connotes
a
rate
change
procedure.
the
petitioners
recognized
this.
they
don't
say
that
the
provision
expresses
an
agreement
on
a
rate
changing
procedure.
they
say
it
is
to
be
implied
and
i
assume
that
means
that
the
provision
is
ambiguous
and
needs
construction
and
this
is
a
reasonable
implication
of
the
provision.
we
think
it
is
neither
to
be
reasonably
implied
nor
found
when
it
takes
at
least
a
paragraph
to
state
what
they
claim
for
this
little
phrase.
there's
nothing
in
the
language
that
that
purports
to
say
what
is
effective
to
change
a
rate.
there's
nothing
in
it
that
even
suggests
under
what
circumstances
a
change
can
be
made
and
there's
certainly
no
agreement
in
it
to
pay
any
rate
whatsoever
or
even
an
agreement
that
the
mere
act
of
filing
will
make
the
rate
that
united
filed
effective
on
the
face
of
it.
we
find
in
the
agreement
in
the
provision
only
an
agreement
to
pay
the
effective
and
i
emphasize
effective,
superseding
rate
and
i
emphasize
effective
because
that
provision
is
a
limitation.
it's
a
condition
upon
an
obligation
to
pay
any
different
rate.
we
know
in
the
mobile
case
that
rates
are
not
effective
superseding
rate
simply
because
the
pipeline
company
has
filed
it
to
the
commission.
in
that
case,
united
had
filed
a
rate,
the
commission
had
accepted
it,
it
was
treated
by
united
and
the
commission
is
effective,
and
mobile
even
paid
it,
but
this
court
held
that
the
filing
was
nullity.
it
was
not
an
effective
superseding
rate
because
the
commission
had
exceeded
its
authority
in
accepting
that
filing
since
it
was
not
an
agreed
upon
change
and
united
had
exceeded
its
power
to
file
it
because
it
was
not
of
that
character.
and
united
is
keenly
aware
of
the
lack
of
resemblance
of
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
provision
to
this
agreement
on
a
rate
change
procedure
or
even
a
reservation
of
the
right
to
file
rates.
and
they're
keenly
aware
of
the
rule
of
contract
construction
that
says
that
a
contact
is
to
be
construed
more
strongly
against
the
draftsman
and
of
course
for
draftsman
of
the
contract,
its
creator,
its
author
is
united.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
--
i
think
so
if
i
have
--
have
in
mind
the
revision
of
the
provision.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--
provision
was
only
be
eliminate
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
think
so
if
i
understand
the
revision.
i
think
the
revision
was
to
exclude
from
the
language
that's
on
page
9
of
our
brief
the
word
“effective”.
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
it
would
probably
make
a
difference.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
because
we
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
but
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
provision
would
then
be
susceptible
of
the
interpretation
that
the
purchaser
had
agreed
to
pay
whatever
rate
united
filed
and
that
was
the
rate
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
don't
understand
why
not.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
but
he
can
agree
to
a
new
rate.
now,
even
though
united
and
the
purchaser
agree
on
the
rate,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
commission
is
precluded
from
reviewing
and
modifying
it.
that's
where
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that's
exactly
our
contention
that
the
inclusion
of
the
word
“effective”
has
reference
only
to
rates
that
achieve
their
effectiveness
through
the
exercise
by
the
commission
of
its
paramount
review
policy.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
with
that,
we
thoroughly
agree.
we
certainly
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
justice
frankfurter
if
i
understand
that
i
have
some
trouble
with
that,
may
i
try
to
explain
my
difficulty?
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
certainly
--
i
certainly
would
--
would
hope
--
of
my
being
here
is
--
is
pointless.
as
we
read
mobile,
the
natural
gas
company
and
its
customers
have
complete
freedom
to
initially
enter
into
contracts
and
to
negotiate
new
rates.
now,
as
we
read
mobile
when
the
pipeline
company
has
that
kind
of
a
rate,
it
may
file
it
under
section
4
(d).
that
rate
is
made
effective
by
its
own
action
as
the
court
said
in
mobile
as
we
read
the
case
by
giving
to
the
commission
the
notice
required
by
the
notification
procedure.
now,
the
commission
may
decide
to
do
nothing
about
it
and
then
they
may
charge
it
or
it
may
suspend
it.
now,
as
we
see
it
that
agreed
upon
rate
if
it
is
permitted
to
become
effective,
of
course
may
then
be
charged.
if
it
is
suspended,
its
provision
would
become
effective
at
the
end
of
the
suspension
period
and
then
again
maybe
charged
by
the
pipeline
company.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
oh
yes.
if
--
if
the
commission
and
the
interim
period
has
concluded
the
proceeding,
it
never
really
becomes
the
rate
that
they
charge.
they
charge
only
the
rate
that
the
commission
determines
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding.
now,
i
--
i
think
i
see
now
what
your
honor
was
getting
at
that
despite
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
effective
superseding
always
means
that
which
the
commission
accepts
for
filing
and
permits
to
become
effective
by
its
authority
under
the
act.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
think
not.
i
think
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
certainly,
would
have
to
agree
that
it
could
mean
anything
else
having
come
through
to
the
same
point
by
my
own
exposition.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
--
i
see
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
point
that
even
if
it
were
agreement
to
pay
any
superseding
rate,
it
would
have
to
be
an
effective
superseding
rate
that
could
be
charged.
but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
was,
that
if
the
word
“effective”
had
been
left
out,
you
could
possibly
interpret
that
as
meaning
that
it
is
at
least
an
agreement
as
between
the
parties
by
the
purchaser
to
pay
what
is
tendered
to
the
commission
vis-a-vis
the
parties
without
bringing
in
the
commission's
authority.
now,
if
i
may,
as
i
was
saying,
united
is
keenly
aware
of
the
lack
of
resemblance
of
this
provision
to
an
agreement
on
a
rate
change
procedure
and
it
is
keenly
aware
of
the
provision
of
the
--
the
rule
of
contract
and
construction
that
says
a
contract
is
to
be
interpreted
most
strongly
against
the
party
drafting
it
which
as
i
said
was
in
this
case
united.
it
therefore
tries
to
raise
the
provision
to
the
stature
of
the
term
of
art
in
the
industry
which
it
says
was
accepted
as
evidencing
an
agreement
on
a
rate
change
procedure.
there's
simply
nothing
to
this.
this
is
an
act
of
rationalization.
prior
to
mobile
and
our
motions
to
reject,
it
was
not
thought,
it
was
never
suggested
that
the
power
to
change
rates
was
derived
from
the
contracts
or
any
provision
of
contract
between
the
pipeline
company
and
their
customers.
in
fact,
the
argument
in
mobile
was
that
power
was
derived
from
the
act
and
that
it
existed
regardless
of
what
there
was
in
contract
against
it.
the
act
was
considered
to
be
the
source
of
the
authority.
the
contract
argument
was
a
development
of
mobile
and
of
our
motions
to
reject
and
was
advanced
to
meet
those
developments.
and
we
submit,
that
united
has
turned
to
the
contracts
for
escape
for
mobile
and
this
little
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
provisions
has
been
selected
as
the
candidate
most
likely
to
succeed
as
the
provision
in
their
opinion
more
susceptible
to
interpretation
of
the
view
they
tried
to
put
upon
it.
the
provision
is
of
course
no
term
of
argument.
if
it
were,
we
would
expect
to
find
it
in
each
of
the
contracts
in
the
industry
in
precisely
those
terms,
but
the
commission
itself
concedes,
and
i
believe
the
concession
appears
at
pages
111
of
its
brief,
that
the
contract
language
varies
as
between
one
natural
gas
company
and
its
customers
and
another
natural
gas
company
and
its
customers
and
we
have
printed
as
appendix
a
to
our
brief.
the
provisions
from
the
formal
contract
that
texas
gas
transmission
corporation
uses
which
is
one
of
the
pipeline
petitioners
in
this
case,
and
that
appendix
discloses
immediately
that
they
employ
an
--
an
entirely
different
set
of
words
for
what
i
might
call
their
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
provision.
and
additionally,
it
discloses
that
they
did
include
an
express
reservation
to
change
rates
under
certain
specified
conditions
and
the
specified
conditions
were
when
certain
increases
incur
when
increases
incurred
in
certain
specified
taxes.
unless
these
contracts
are
held
to
mean
what
they
say,
the
publication
provision
of
section
4
(c)
of
the
act
which
says
that
the
contracts
need
to
be
published,
so
that
they're
available
to
the
public
and
people
may
know
what's
in
them,
we
submit
would
be
frustrated.
in
interpreting
this
contract
and
considering
it,
we
cannot
lose
sight
of
a
fact
that
it
wasn't
drafted
by
an
amateur.
it
was
drafted
by
united
which
mr.
carson
yesterday
described
as
one
of
the
largest
pipeline
companies
in
the
country.
we
think
perhaps
it
is
the
largest.
it
has
all
sorts
of
resources
at
its
command,
including
rate
experts
and
the
most
skillful
of
counsel.
the
drafting
of
rate
contracts
for
united,
of
rate
schedules,
of
tariffs
is
a
day
in
and
day
out
occurrence.
and
when
united
sets
out
to
draft
the
provision
reserving
the
right
to
file
a
change
in
rates
united
knows
how
to
do
it
and
we
don't
have
to
infer
that.
we
have
the
contemporaneous
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
the
meaning
and
intent
of
the
contract.
the
only
contemporaneous
evidence
i
might
say
which
shows
that
united
never
regarded
the
effect
of
superseding
rate
schedules
provision
as
a
reservation
of
a
right
to
file
changes
and
never
intended
it
to
perform
that
function.
let
me
briefly
describe
that
history.
as
mr.
carlson
told
you
yesterday,
united
had
brought
the
commission
for
about
four
years
in
and
out
of
the
courts
challenging
the
validity
of
the
regulations,
which
incidentally
it
now
embraces
and
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
ever
came
down
to
pipeline.
united
finally,
in
1952,
decided
that
it
would
comply
with
the
commission's
regulations.
so,
in
accordance
with
those
regulations
it
prepared
a
propose
tariff.
now,
the
regulations
say
that
in
the
tariff
you're
supposed
to
have
the
proposed
form
of
contract
you
will
use
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
gas.
united
therefore,
drafted
a
proposed
form
of
contract
included
it
in
the
tariff.
the
proposed
form
of
contract
included
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
provision
that
we
have
before
us
today
and
additionally,
as
we
set
out
at
page
57
of
our
brief,
i
think
it
is,
it's
at
page
57
yes,
included
a
provision
expressly
reserving
the
right
to
file
changes
in
rates.
if
i
may
take
just
a
moment
to
read
it,
“the
rate
established
by
seller,”
united
said,
“are
designed
to
reflect
seller's
cost
of
rendering
service
to
provide
a
fair
rate
of
return
to
seller.”
in
the
event
of
an
increase
in
seller's
cost,
or
of
any
change
which
would
result
in
the
rate
of
seller
providing
less
than
a
fair
rate
of
return,
seller
shall
have
the
right
to
revise
its
rates
to
reflect
such
change.
such
revised
rates
shall
be
charge
only
after
they
have
them
filed
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
become
effective
in
accordance
with
its
rules
and
regulations.
now,
unhappily
perhaps
the
united,
it
included
this
very
same
provision
in
the
general
terms
and
conditions
of
the
tariff.
the
commission's
regulations
expressly
state
you
may
not
include
that
kind
of
a
provision
in
the
general
terms
and
conditions.
the
regulations
say,
you
may
include
that
kind
of
provision
in
your
form
of
your
contract
only.
the
commission
therefore,
rejected
the
propose
tariff
concluding
the
form
of
contract
and
returned
it
to
united
pointing
out
that
they
had
never
accepted
a
tariff
which
included
the
provision
but
what
that
they
having
accepted
forms
of
contracts
that
included
such
provisions
as
authorized
by
the
regulations.
the
united
was
extremely
anxious
by
this
time
after
filing
to
the
commission
for
four
years
to
have
its
tariff
accepted
as
rapidly
as
possible.
and
united
was
laboring
under
the
impression
that
the
commission
would
require
a
rephrasing
of
the
provision
before
it
would
even
approve
it
for
inclusion
in
its
form
of
contract.
rather
than
incur
the
additional
delay
that
they
thought
might
develop,
they
struck
the
provision
not
only
from
the
general
terms
and
conditions,
but
they
struck
the
provision
from
the
form
of
contract
as
well.
and
the
form
of
contract
which
was
approved
without
this
provision
became
the
executed
contracts
for
the
purchase
and
sale
of
gas
that
we
have
before
us
in
this
very
case.
and
now,
faced
by
mobile,
faced
by
our
motions
to
reject,
united
seeks
to
read
in
that
--
into
that
effect
a
superseding
provision
a
wholly
different
provision
which
of
its
own
volition
it
had
deleted.
even
if
united
were
able
to
hurdle
this
contemporaneous
evidence
of
their
intent,
there
is
yet
another
hurdle
before
that.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
for
a
moment
to
this
little
pamphlet
which
is
the
appendix
to
united's
brief
at
page
16a.
i'm
particularly,
interested
in
the
middle
portion
of
the
middle
proviso,
which
says
and
i'm
going
to
skip
a
few
words
that
refer
to
another
section
that
are
not
material
here,
“a
natural
gas
company
may
state
in
the
service
agreement
that
it
is
or
will
be
its
privileges
under
certain
specified
conditions
to
propose
to
the
commission
a
modification,
change
or
substitution
of
the
then
effective
rate
or
charge.”
and
incidentally,
may
i
interpolate
here
for
a
moment
to
say
the
reference
to
certain
specified
conditions
has
reference
to
various
components
of
costs
involved
in
serving
--
in
selling
gas
that
may
go
up
and
down
if
the
case
maybe,
taxes,
cost
the
gas
purchase
and
so
on.
now,
united
was
on
notice
as
to
what
it
had
to
do
to
reserve
its
right
to
file
rates.
and
the
provision
that
it
voluntarily
deleted
was
in
response
to
this
permission
that
the
commission
was
giving
them
in
the
rules
and
regulations.
now,
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedule
provision
doesn't
even
begin
to
come
close
to
meeting
the
requirements
of
this
regulation.
it
does
not
even
remotely
specify
any
terms
or
conditions
under
which
it
would
be
united's
right
to
file
changes
in
rates.
and
if
it
were
to
be
interpreted
as
united
now
contends,
it
would
be
unlawful
under
these
regulations
as
the
commission's
recent
decision
in
the
houston
case
which
we
cite
and
discuss
at
page
62
of
our
brief,
makes
very
clear.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
new
pipeline
company
that
had
been
certificated.
houston,
texas
gas
and
oil
will
take
gas
down
to
florida.
in
accordance
with
its
right
and
under
the
commission's
regulations,
it
undertook
to
prepare
its
tariff
and
there
again,
it
included
a
proposed
form
of
agreement.
the
commissioner
rejected
it
and
let
me
read
just
quickly
the
language
used
by
the
commission
in
rejecting
it
and
i
quote,
this
is
at
page
62
of
our
brief,
“in
the
form
of
service
agreement,
no
changes
for
the
filing
of
changes
are
set
forth
while
section
154.38
(d)
(3),”
i
interpolate
the
section
we
were
just
looking
at,
“of
the
commission's
regulation,
requires
that
the
service
agreements
set
forth,
the
specified
conditions
under
which
a
change
my
be
filed.”
accordingly,
the
commission
said,
“the
present
language
of
the
form
of
service
agreement
is
not
allowable
and
revised
tariff
sheet
should
be
filed
enumerating
the
conditions,
if
any,
under
which
rate
changes
may
be
proposed.”
this
provision
would
have
to
be
rejected
for
the
very
same
purpose.
and
to
interpret
it
as
they
would
contend,
just
flies
in
the
face
of
that
provision
and
the
contemporaneous
evidence.
if
there
is
any
lingering
doubt
that
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
provision
was
not
intended
to
perform
the
function
that
the
petitioner
is
now
claim
for
it,
we
submit
that
doubt
is
dispelled
when
the
unconscionable
results
that
are
produced
by
petitioner's
interpretation
are
considered
when
applied
to
sales,
for
resale,
for
industrial
use
only,
which
have
heretofore
been
referred
to.
such
sales
are
particularly
important
to
mississippi
as
they
are
to
many
other
distributors.
for
example,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
and
united
does
not
deny
this,
willmut
oil
and
gas,
another
contract
customer
of
united,
purchases
gas
under
united's
rate
schedule,
which
it
has
provided
the
sales,
for
resale,
for
industrial
use
only,
45%
of
its
volume
of
sales
is
that
type
of
a
sale
for
industrial
use.
and
the
united
only
answer
is,
“well,
it's
only
to
one
customer.”
whether
it's
to
one
customer
or
10
customers,
however,
45%
is
an
important
part
of
that
utility's
sales.
in
the
case
of
the
distributors
of
gas
in
the
pacific
northwest,
as
the
amicus
brief
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
washington
makes
claim,
68%
of
the
sales
made
by
the
distributors
in
that
case,
for
industrial
use
are
purchased
under
contracts
of
this
non-suspendable,
non--refundable
type.
and
mississippi,
for
the
period
involved
in
this
case,
its
purchases
of
gas
from
united
or
sales,
for
resale,
for
industrial
use
only,
represent
the
65%.
and
let
me
pause
here
to
say
that
in
the
answering
briefs,
we
have
been
vigorously
challenged
as
to
the
accuracy
of
our
65%
and
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
that
65%
was
computed
for
me
at
my
request
by
responsible
official
of
mississippi
valley
gas
company.
and
it's
obvious
to
me,
although,
i
can't
for
the
light
of
me
analyze
all
of
the
figures
that
have
been
thrown
at
me
in
those
answering
briefs
and
where
they
come
from.
it
is
clear
that
they
are
talking
about
some
percentage
in
another
period
not
involved
in
this
case
when
they
say
the
percentage
is
only
20%.
well,
let
me
make
this
point,
whether
20%
or
65%,
the
point
is
that
it
is
significant
either
at
20%
or
at
65%.
let
me,
for
a
moment,
before
i
get
too
deeply
into
an
explanation
of
the
significance
of
these
sales,
repeat
in
part
what
mr.
morrow
has
pointed
out.
except
for
sales,
for
resale,
for
industrial
use
only,
the
commission
has
the
power
to
suspend
new
rates,
and
if
the
proceeding
is
not
concluded
at
the
end
of
five
months,
they
become
effective
subject
to
refund
on
motion
of
the
natural
gas
company.
when
the
commission
concludes
its
proceedings,
they
can
make
it
retroactive.
but
with
respect
to
sales,
for
resale,
for
industrial
use
only,
the
commission
has
no
power
of
suspension
and
it
has
held
that
it
is
completely
without
power
of
refund.
those
new
rates
are
non-suspendable,
non-refundable.
they
come
--
they
become
effective
30
days
after
filing.
now,
let's
see
the
consequence
of
that.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
i
--
i
can.
i
would
like
to
explain
why
i
don't
think
i
can.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
i
simply
want
--
i
simply
want
to
say
that
there's
just
a
jury
of
legislate
--
legislative
information.
it
seems
to
have
suddenly
come
in
at
the
end
of
the
legislative
debates
and
i
don't
think
anyone
can
really
say
what
in
the
world
caused
that?
i
know
when
i
was
with
the
commission,
we
wrestled
with
it,
and
i
think
perhaps
they're
still
wrestling
with
it
over
there.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
oh,
yes.
yes,
i
--
i
would
certainly
have
to
say
that.
now,
but
the
significance
of
it
is
--
is
that
they
are
contending,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
a
purchaser
of
its
own
volition
agreed
to
enter
into
a
contract
that
granted
to
its
supplier
the
power
to
impose,
to
exact,
and
to
retain
at
will
whatever
united,
under
petitioner's
interpretation
of
their
contracts
chose
to
file.
now,
let
me
bring
it
right
back
to
the
case
at
hand.
the
increase
filed
for
that
class
of
sale
was
about
$650,000
in
round
number
out
of
the
total
increase
to
mississippi
valley
of
about,
let
us
say,
$900,000.
now,
under
petitioner's
interpretation,
that
filing
maybe
made,
it
goes
into
effect
30
days
after
it's
filed
because
the
commission
is
without
power
to
suspend
it,
and
they
can
charge
it
and
collect
it
for
as
long
as
that
proceeding
is
pending.
and
when
that
proceeding
is
over
and
the
commission
says,
“united,
you
had
no
right
to
charge
that
rate.
it
was
excessive
all
through
that
period
and
you're
not
to
make
that
charge
to
the
future.”
and
mississippi
then
says,
“united,
how
about
giving
me
my
money
back”
and
united
says,
“sorry,
we
pocket
that.”
the
commission
has
held
it
has
no
power
of
refund.
now,
we
submit
that
no
responsible
officer
of
mississippi,
the
board
of
directors
of
mississippi,
no
responsible
officer
of
any
distribution
company
would
enter
into
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
gas,
which
is
essential
to
its
economic
wellbeing,
which
is
essential
to
its
ability
to
sell
gas
to
domestic
customers
at
rates
within
their
reach,
to
grant
to
their
supplier
the
power
at
will
in
their
unfettered
discretion
to
file
any
rate
they
choose
and
to
collect
it
from
the
date
30
days
after
filing.
and
even
this
prospective
relief
is
illusory
because,
again,
in
its
unfettered
discretion,
as
soon
as
the
commission
has
issued
its
order
saying
that
the
rates
of
the
past
were
unreasonable
and
they
should
be
reduced
for
the
future,
united
can
again
come
forward
with
a
new
rate
increase
for
this
class
of
service
and
it
becomes
effective
within
30
days.
in
this
very
case,
during
the
pendency
of
these
proceedings,
united
has
filed
three
additional
rate
increases
unilaterally
for
this
type
of
service
and
united
has
been
collecting
it
under
its
interpretation.
now,
we
submit
that
it's
just
simply
inconceivable
and
unreasonable
to
interpret
the
provision
as
an
agreement
by
mississippi
to
confer
such
a
power
on
its
supplier.
mississippi
denies
and
we
have
denied
it
repeatedly
that
we
ever
intended
to
come
to
such
an
agreement.
let
me
take
a
moment
to
explain
the
significance
of
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
as
to
why
there
is
no
power
is
suspended
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
no.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
oh,
on
this
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
this
is
the
first
case
i
think
that
the
commission
ruled
at
the
moment.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
oh,
under
--
this
--
this
power
of
lack
of
refund
power,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
yes,
let
me
put
that
thing.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that's
a
--
that's
a
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that's
a
new
one.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that's
a
new
one.
that
was
a
construct
--
well
--
well,
if
--
it
did
--
i
was
going
to
--
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
it
didn't
construe
section
4,
but
it
construed
the
contracts,
but
actually,
it
had
to
do
both.
it
turned
to
the
contracts
and
said
this
is
an
agreement
on
a
rate-changing
procedure,
and
then
it
turned
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
the
first
time
--
the
first
time
it
was
brought
up.
i've
been
trying
to
go
but
mobile
came
along
and
this
problem
in
our
case
was
the
first
one
arising
after
mobile.
i
think
we
were
the
first,
perhaps
not
the
first,
but
the
first
decision
that
came
down
on
the
motion
to
reject.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that
they
made
that
decision
in
the
mobile
case,
i
think
it's
in
64
of
our
brief.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
at
page
64
of
our
brief,
footnote
35.
incidentally,
that
was
the
order
in
the
mobile
case
which
came
up
to
this
court
and
we'll
review
again
in
the
mobile
case.
let
me
take
just
a
few
minutes
to
point
out
the
commission
in
its
brief
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
parading
all
sorts
of
public
goblins
and
calamities
before
the
court
in
an
effort
to
secure
a
reversal
of
the
decision
below.
but
we
have
given
chapter
and
verse
on
the
actual
experience
of
the
industry
since
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
and
that
actual
experience
completely
contradicts
the
commission's
speculations
which
incidentally
are
completely
undocumented.
one
thing
we
pointed
out,
for
example,
when
the
commission
raised
the
specter
of
inability
of
the
pipeline
companies
to
raise
capital,
we
said
why?
here
is
evidence
that
these
pipeline
companies,
since
the
memphis
decision,
since
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
have
been
able
to
raise
capital.
they
have
received
a
very
favorable
reception
of
the
market,
in
some
cases,
even
more
favorable
than
the
reception
that
they
received
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
and
the
commission
is
unable
to
deny
that.
it
conceived
in
its
answering
brief
that
that's
the
fact,
but
what
is
the
commission's
answer?
the
commission
says,
“well,
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
there
were
some
special
factor
that
accounted
to
the
favorable
reception.”
in
other
words,
when
the
news
is
bad,
blame
it
on
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
but
when
the
news
is
good,
shrug
it
off,
blame
it
on
something
else.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
completely
right.
it
helps
restore
that
stability
of
supply
arrangement,
that
order
of
chaos,
which
this
industry
needs
to
be
a
healthy
industry.
thank
you
very
much.
