mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
petitioner
natural
gas
and
pipeline;
united
gas
pipeline
company,
petitioner
in
number
23,
i
would
like
to
speak
in
subordination
to
the
solicitor
general
presentation
because
his
client
of
the
federal
power
commission
is
very
much
in
control
of
the
interstate
operations
of
this
petitioner
as
all
other
pipelines
and
interstate
suppliers
of
natural
gas
for
resale,
but
at
the
same
time
i
would
like
to
devote
myself
if
i
may
upon
his
shoulders
because
in
this
petition
and
our
request
for
reversal
of
the
court
below,
we
speak
for
a
commercial
interest
with
great
importance,
not
only
to
ourselves
as
we
can
see,
but
to
the
gas
consuming
public
and
the
industries
who
would
use
this
pipe
or
fuel.
united
gas
pipeline
itself,
one
of
the
larger
transporters
of
natural
gas
interstate,
it
has
24,000
miles
of
transmission;
it
sells
gas
and
other
line.
it
sells
gas
at
wholesale
only
and
the
single
fact
of
this
case
and
agreements
of
all
consumers
represented
by
briefs
file
before
the
court,
it
has
had
to
pay
and
on
is
increasing
prices
for
natural
gas
since
the
early
forties,
none
an
unusual
thing.
a
fuel
is
so
valuable
as
characterized
by
justice
jackson
in
the
hope
case,
which
has
been
adapted
now
to
so
much
residential
and
so
much
industrial
consumer
use
of
all
kinds
by
the
interstate
pipeline
that
have
---
the
country
through
miracles
of
technical
adaptation.
if
not
wonderful
that
this
limited
supply
despite
explorations,
constant
and
expensive
exploration
has
resulted
in
the
constant
bidding
of
the
price
of
gas
and
field,
so
that
in
the
relatively
static
--
when
in
--
as
against
the
relatively
static
stage
of
the
industry,
say
in
the
early
1940s
just
after
the
enactment
of
the
natural
gas
act,
a
field
competitive
price
with
3
or
4
cents
per
thousand
cubic
feet.
today
it's
running
up
to
24
and
25
cents
per
thousand
cubic
feet.
and
that's
simply
because
people
want
it
and
because
there's
no
way
of
controlling
finally
the
price
of
a
valuable
commodity
in
short
supply.
now,
through
pipelines
of
this
petitioner,
their
flow
annualized
over
last
year
the
incredible
volume
of
1,250,000,000,000
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
and
other
pipelines
are
as
large
and
many
are
almost
as
large,
so
that
the
cost
of
constantly
replacing
this
wasting
asset,
in
exploration
is
a
(inaudible)
and
hence,
rate
increases.
we
make
no
apology
for
the
fact,
and
that
the
proceeding
out
of
which
the
present
motion
to
dismiss
and
reject
filings
arose
was
an
application
for
rate
increase.
it
has
been
succeeded
by
other
necessary
applications
for
which
i'll
speak
in
a
minute.
if
i
mention
to
the
court
that
1
cent
addition
for
thousand
cubic
feet
for
the
price
of
gas
means
$10
million
a
year
approximately
additional
cost
of
service
and
that
90%
of
the
costs
of
service
are
represented
in
these
filings
that
i
will
exhibit
to
the
court
is
the
cost
of
gas.
you
will
see
why
that
must
necessarily
be
so.
now,
our
case
here
as
i
say
--
said
rests
upon
the
solicitor
general's
case,
and
the
tariff
and
filed
service
agreement
formula
that
the
commission
has,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
imposed
upon
the
industry.
i
think
that
imposition
was
no
doubt
a
wise
one.
it
has
facilitated
the
understanding
of
the
gas
charges
simplified
and
made
uniform
the
tariffs,
rates
and
classifications.
but
it
is
a
form
in
which
the
parties,
the
parties
here,
and
other
pipelines,
and
natural
gas
companies
whose
pricing
methods
may
be
affected
by
your
honors'
decision,
it
is
a
practice
which
has
been
imposed
by
order
144
as
of
the
year
1948.
your
honors,
bear
in
mind
that
the
natural
gas
act
dates
from
1938,
you
will
note
that
for
10
years,
the
commission
administered
its
regulation
by
requiring
the
filing
of
all
contractor's
rate
schedules.
and
the
mobile
contract
which
you
had
before
you
in
350
united
states
was
one
of
those
originally
filed
contracts
filed
and
approved
as
of
1946.
and
as
intimated
in
a
question
from
the
bench,
it
was
a
special
contract
in
that
it
was
a
fixed
price
contract
for
10
years
filed
as
a
pertinent
to
a
resale
contract,
also
fixed
price,
to
the
ideal
cement
company
dependent
upon
the
sale
contract
and
it
had
no
provision
for
price
change
of
any
kind
or
character.
now,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
that
case
concerning
which
have
we
have
no
quarrel
whatever
here,
as
we
think
most
inappropriately
had
been
used,
or
distillations
from
it
i
think
used,
to
invalidate
a
20-year
contract
in
this
tariff-and-service-and-agreement
form
that
i'll
enlarge
upon
in
a
moment,
with
language
not
found
in
the
mobile
case
at
all.
true,
as
was
intimated,
there
was
in
the
record
and
before
the
commission,
in
the
mobile
case,
a
regular
service
agreement
which
around
1955
or
1956
has
been
executed
by
mobile,
but
that
was
not
in
question
in
that
case.
the
motion
to
reject,
which
your
honors'
sustained,
was
insofar
as
the
increase
affected
the
fixed
price
contract.
now,
the
decision
of
the
court
which
is
carefully
limited
to
the
facts
has
been
by
the
court
below,
i
think
to
the
great
injury
of
the
industry
and
the
public,
enlarged
to
apply
to
this
contract
which
provides
in
a
service
agreement
where
payment
under
a
designated
rate
schedule,
“or
any
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
on
file
with
the
federal
power
commission.”
those
words
or
any
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
have
been
completely
ignored
in
the
construction
by
the
court,
although
given
their
true
value
by
the
commission
on
the
facts
to
indicate
a
promise
to
pay
the
effective
rates
from
time
to
time
on
part,
that
was
the
finding
of
the
commission
based
on
all
the
evidence,
but
we
are
confronted
with
an
application
through
a
misconstruction
of
your
honors'
decision,
which
deletes
those
words
from
the
contract.
now,
may
i
spend
a
little
more
time
on
the
contract
because,
while
the
issue
here
affects
at
least
nine
pipeline
companies
with
identical
language
for
change,
and
the
great
many
others
were
somewhat
similar
language,
there
are
special
facts
in
the
situation
at
the
united
gas
pipeline
company
which
are
laid
hold
off
by
the
respondents
to
argue
that
those
words
don't
mean
what
we
say.
united
gas
pipeline
company,
as
the
solicitor
general
intimated,
resisted
the
new
tariff
arrangement
set
forth
in
order
144.
it
felt
that
that
tariff
arrangement,
service
agreement
arrangement,
which
required
the
restatement
of
all
contracts,
deprived
it
of
substantive
contract
rights.
litigation
resulted
which
was
tendered
to
this
court,
which
resulted
in
some
amendment
of
the
tariff
provision
and
order
140
--
part
154
of
the
regulations
thus
promulgated
to
permit
existing
contracts
to
be
restated.
to
preserve
their
special
clauses
pending
their
life
provided
that
the
filing
companies
thereafter
operated
in
the
tariff-and-service
agreement
form.
that
was
done,
but
the
result
was
that
the
united
gas
pipeline
came
late
to
this
system.
so
your
honors
will
find
the
first
filing
which
it
may
the
so-called
“conversion
tariff”
appeared
in
july
1952,
and
this
filing
for
an
increase
out
of
which
this
motion
arises
in
september
1955
and
since
then,
it's
adverted
into
in
my
--
brief
of
my
friend's
opposite
there
had
been
other
filings
which
they
label,
“unilateral
increases.”
it's
a
ratable
most
in
a
year
because
the
price
of
gas
has
gone
up
and
we
are
limited
in
our
filings
for
rate
increases
strictly
by
these
regulations
to
a
showing
--
a
cost
showing,
building
up
a
rate-base
from
which
a
fixed
rate
of
return
will
yield
revenue,
distributed
on
a
cost
of
service
allocation
to
the
different
rate
zone.
now,
here
is
a
picture.
here
is
in
fact
a
file
of
september
1955.
it
proceeds
by
setting
forth
the
new
rate
schedules
and
those
to
purchasers,
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record.
then
it
gives
an
index,
it
gives
an
explanation
of
the
series
of
the
new
rates.
it
gives
three
(inaudible),
including
a
flowchart,
and
then
it
gives
in
great
detail
as
demanded
for
the
regulations
that
i
call
your
attention,
calculations
of
cost
of
plant,
cost
of
gas,
requirements
of
an
--
return
to
investors,
comparative
earnings
price
ratios,
and
so
on
and
so
on
with
meticulous
detail.
now,
your
honors,
this
filing
is
not
a
mere
dropping
at
in
the
office
of
the
commissioner
or
mailing
a
letter
to
the
commission
as
some
of
our
adversaries
might
incur.
if
the
commission
staff
on
examining
this
finds
it
does
not
comply
with
the
form
exacted
by
the
regulation,
this
is
rejected
out
of
hand
and
we're
given
time
to
--
to
repair
the
deficiency,
the
deficiency
letter
technique
is
used.
and
this
filing
is
not
only
posted
in
the
office
of
the
commission,
but
it's
mailed
to
all
the
important
large
volume
purchasers
and
selected
schedules
are
mailed
to
all
the
distributors
that
purchase
from
us
so
that
they
can
comment
with
knowledge
during
the
commission's
inquiry
on
--
on
filing
on
the
suspended
--
in
the
suspension
period.
now,
what
are
the
rate
schedules
to
which
this
filing
and
subsequent
filings
are
in
amendment
as
permitted
by
the
statue,
and
the
contract?
they
appear
in
general
structure
at
the
beginning
of
the
record,
your
honor.
those
are
1952
rate
schedules
and
i'm
informed
that
they
have
now
been
superseded
in
many
respects.
you
will
note
after
the
first
20
pages,
a
series
of
pages
called
general
terms
and
conditions,
and
then
you
will
find
in
the
general
form
and
in
the
general
terms
and
conditions
provisions
as
to
the
service
agreement
on
page
44.
and
in
the
tariff
separately
you
will
find
on
page
47
a
form
of
service
agreement.
those
are
all
at
their
inception
cut
in
combination
a
complete
original
tariff
and
which
includes
as
you
will
note
the
form
of
service
agreement
or
contract
between
the
forms.
now,
to
illustrate
how
those
rates
of
charges
which
the
solicitor
general
explained
as
being
uniform
and
published
to
the
world,
articulated
with
the
contract
for
purchase.
may
i
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
one
of
the
more
recent
contracts
at
page
305
of
the
record
which
is
open
to
a
class.
this
rate
schedule,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
is
available
to
any
natural
gas
pipeline
company
hereinafter
called
bio
and
on
page
306
you
will
find
the
rate
for
natural
gas
service
as
a
demand
charge
and
a
commodity
charge.
i
won't
take
the
time
to
illustrate
the
different
types
of
rates,
but
the
commission
currently
controls
the
classification
of
those
rates.
and
then
the
rate
on
page
3
in
this
generally
filed
schedule
dated
1954
is
articulated
with
a
service
agreement
at
page
94
which
happens
to
be
that
of
southern
natural
gas
company
also
a
petitioner
and
the
service
agreement
you
will
note
provides
the
scope
of
the
agreement,
delivery
point
and
pressure,
volumetric
obligations,
other
matters
of
negotiations
between
the
parties
as
to
the
type
of
service
and
on
page
970
under
article
4,
you
will
find
the
article
price.
all
gas
delivered
shall
be
paid
for
by
a
buyer
on
the
seller's
rate
schedule
or
any
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
on
file
with
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
--
what
inference
do
i
wish
you
to
draw
from
what,
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that
these
forms
are
prescribed
by
regulatory
authority,
exercised
under
statutory
power
and
that
the
service
agreement
is
intended
to
refer
so
they
continue
the
service
agreement
in
its
price
clause
it
refers
to
the
continually
changing
series
of
rate
schedules.
and
--
and
so
intended
by
all
parties
as
testified
below.
in
other
words,
i
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
the
peculiar
form
of
this
to
show
that
despite
the
impact
of
the
regulation,
it
is
essentially
contractual.
and
i
avail
myself
of
the
extensive
treatment
of
the
liberty
of
the
contract
of
the
gas
companies
in
your
honor's
opinion
in
the
mobile
case
and
particularly,
i
address
myself
with
the
language
at
page
342
where
the
court
said
that
in
the
mobile
contract,
there
was
no
power
to
change
if
the
purported
change
is
one
that
the
natural
gas
company
has
the
power
to
make.
the
change
is
completed
upon
compliance
with
the
notice
requirement
and
so
on.
i
say
that
--
that
the
parties
understood
that
the
filing
of
a
new
schedule
under
--
in
connection
with
the
service
agreement,
especially
calling
attention
to
effective
superseding
rate
schedules,
embraces
just
the
type
of
change
to
which
this
court
especially
left
the
way
open
in
the
mobile
case.
and
i
contrast
that
which
to
me
the
completely
unintended
and
unintelligible
insistence
of
our
adversaries
that
this
court
decided
in
the
mobile
case,
there
could
not
be
a
new
rate
until
the
buyer
had
specifically
agreed
to
the
price.
now,
i'm
digressing
because
i
let
on
to
your
honor's
inquiry,
but
in
connection
with
what
--
this
was
--
the
solicitor
general
said
about
a
rate
investigation
under
section
5.
may
i
mention
to
your
honors
that
without
any
criticism
or
whatever
of
the
federal
power
commission
by
reason
of
the
smallest
of
its
staff,
the
investigation
under
g1428
began
on
october
1948,
lasted
10
years
and
finished
last
year
and
the
contention
of
our
adversaries
is
that
during
that
period,
our
cost
study
which
was
necessary,
we
could
not
recover
the
price
of
gas.
we
would
be
out
of
business
if
that
was
so.
i
know
that's
quite
impractical,
let
me
address
myself
to
the
other
angle.
what
would
be
the
sense
in
asking
all
the
customers
of
united
gas
pipeline
company
to
agree
to
a
particular
rate
change?
can
we
ask
them
to
read
these
two
volumes?
well
your
honors,
have
an
amicus
brief
offered
before
you
in
which
the
city
of
harrisburg
says,
“it's
an
imposition
on
us
to
make
us
read
those
volumes.
we
can't
understand
them.
how
can
the
four
pipeline
purchasers,
the
four
pipeline
transportation
customers,
the
six
cities
in
alabama,
the
five
cities
in
florida,
the
14
cities
in
louisiana,
the
13
cities
in
mississippi,
the
seven
cities
in
texas,
our
company's
distributors
buying
directly
from
us
and
the
59
cities
in
texas
buying
from
the
united
gas
corporation
gas
that
we
sell
with,
how
can
they
negotiate
new
contracts
with
us
in
any
kind
of
unison
in
any
reasonable
period
of
time?”
as
mr.
general
as
well
said,
you
can
only
expect
coming
to
the
consensual
agreement
if
there
will
be
an
inequality
of
power.
if
for
example,
the
new
distributor
needs
or
the
consumer
needs
more
gas,
i'm
told
that
the
contracts
affecting
the
59
towns
in
texas
served
by
united
gas
corporation
are
in
effect
although
not
in
terms
of
requirements
contracts.
they
can't
need
more
gas
in
an
effective
way.
and
to
deal
with
each
of
them
would
have
to
deal
with
each
of
their
city
councils,
and
to
deal
with
each
of
the
communities
and
purchasers
in
the
other
states
would
have
to
deal
with
their
state
commissions.
we'll
never
be
through
and
when
we
got
through,
we'll
be
bound
to
be
the
very
disparities,
the
alleged
discriminations,
the
inequalities,
the
variations

rate
zones,
the
departures
from
allocated
costs
which
would
bring
us
as
mr.
rankin

into
a

wholly
useless
and
most
injurious
alternative
and
one
from
which
i
think
we're
clearly
entitled
to
be
rescued
by
the
terms
of
our
contract.
now
i'd
like
in
the
remaining
time
of
my
initial
presentation
to
refer
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
in
connection
with
the
legal
--
with
the
legal
analysis
and
characterization
of
those
terms.
i
have
referred
to
your
honors
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
take
time
now,
the
controlling
process
of
the
regulations
which
appears
in
our
appendix,
the
white
appendix
at
pages
8
(a)
and
following,
and
the
portions
that
i
particularly
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
rate
increase
filing
that
i've
showed
to
the
court
would
appear
at

and
the
following
in

submitted
with

in
the

at
page
21
(a),
if
the
proposed
change
in
tariff
or
rate
schedule
will
result
in
a
major
increase
in
rates
or
charges,
there
shall
be
submitted
statement
a
to
m
inclusive
described
hereafter.
and
then
omitting
other
detail,
i
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
statements
a
to
m
beginning
at
the
foot
of
page
24
(a)
beginning
with
overall
cost
of
service,
rate
base
and
return,
cost
of
plant
and
so
on
in
utmost
detail
as
to
which
we
have
no
hearing
nor
complaint.
it's
an
incident
in
regulation
and
running
down
through
statement
m.
now,
as
i
understand,
if
a
filing
of
this
character
by
inadvertence
skips
or
mishandles
anyone
of
those
details
is
rejected
out
of
hand.
we
haven't
made
a
filing
yet
or
initiated
a
change
in
rate.
the
surveillance
is
most
--
is
most
exacting.
so,
that
the
intimations
in
the
briefs
opposing,
this
covers
industrial
waste
too,
the
information
in
briefs
opposing
that
the
rate
changing
procedure
under
section
4
is
just
the
means
jacking
up
rates
by
writing
letters
and
as
soon
as
one
increases
refuse
to
write
another
letter
is
quite
superficial
and
oblivious
of
the
true
facts.
now,
as
this
amply
disclosed
in
our
briefs,
i
might
add
before
passing
on,
there's
been
information
that
these
regulations
may
not
be
binding
and
the
companies
perhaps
ought
not
to
abide
by
it.
that
affects
us
because
we
did
our
best
to
protect
ourselves
against
them
in
1948
in
the
litigation
i
spoke
of
that's
mentioned
on
our
briefs.
now,
we
consider
they
are
an
entirely
valid
exercise
statutory
authority
and
we're
persuaded
that
the
discriminations
eliminated
had
been
wisely
eliminated
by
the
type
of
regulation
that
is
now
enforced.
but,
i
call
on
your
honors'
attention
that
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
said
that
the
mobile
case
has
held
it
widely,
these
regulations
are
invalid.
hence,
that
we're
contracting
in
a
wholly
invalid
form
which
has
been
imposed
upon
us
for
the
last
10
years.
and
that
counsel
for
one
of
the
respondents
in
arguing
to
the
commission
below
said
the
same
thing
at
page
1767
of
the
oral
argument
which
is
part
of
the
record
or
on
that
printed
record.
he
said,
“now,
it
is
our
strong
contention
that
section
154,
there
are
parts
of
it
that
are
not
valid
under
the
mobile
decision.
as
everybody
knows,
the
commission
was
under
the
impression
that
the
law
was
different
at
the
time
these
regulations
were
put
into
effect
and
although
they
have
the
force
of
law,
of
course
they
cannot
have
a
force
of
law
if
they
are
in
violation
of
the
act.
this
type
of
contract
your
honors
is
a
well
known
and
long
standing
form
as
we
see
it
for
the
determination
and
redetermination
of
price
by
an
external
standard.
we've
cited
cases
in
our
brief.
they've
been
cited
in
the
number
of
briefs.
our
adversaries
have
closely
examined
them
and
the
best
theory
say
is
that
true
the
rule
for
the
determination
of
price
by
an
external
standard
exists,
but
this
is
not
a
case
for
the
application
of
the
rule.
now,
we
say
it
is.
we
say
that
this
is
a
perfect
case
for
the
application
of
that
well
established
principle
for
the
reason
that
we
have
here
a
standard
erected
of
just
and
reasonable
erected
by
the
statute.
we
have
through
an
initiation
of
price
change
by
the
seller
but
an
initiation
addressed
to
an
entire
class
so
there's
no
choice
of
person
or
discrimination
against
anyone,
that's
attested
here
by
the
courts.
and
procedures
laid
down
in
section
4
which
puts
the
eventual
price
beyond
the
control
of
the
seller
and
subject
to
the
influence
of
the
buyer
who
wishes
to
comment
and
argue
justness
and
reasonableness
which
is
the
statutory
standard
and
that
i
ask
you,
is
it
to
the
essence
of
the
contract
of
this
time.
what
utility
can
there
be?
in
time
i
had,
so
our
customers
who
know
the
most
about
our
rates
in
their
business
by
consensual
acceptance
of
a
stipulated
figure
so
that
they
cannot
contest
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
in
the
commission
for
the
public's
benefit.
or,
if
they
cannot
withstand
in
their
ascent
to
the
particular
rate,
the
court
below
held
they
have
to
do,
they
can
come
in
and
contest
the
justness
and
reasonableness,
what
does
the
ascent
mean?
it
seems
to
me
a
useless
time
wasting
and
expensive
formality.
if
i
may
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
case
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
has
well
considered
this
point
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
last
year,
the
bethlehem
steel
case
at
2
new
york
second
46
456-460
where
the
court
sustained
a
contract
of
sale
by
the
bethlehem
company
allowing
changes
of
price
by
in
accordance
with
increases
or
decreases
in
regular
prices
to
all
purchasers
of
plain
steel
products
and
the
court
said,
that
did
not
give
the
seller
undue
power
of
determination
of
the
contract
clause
citing
two
of
the
cases
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
on
which
we
have
relied.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
2
new
york
second
mr.
justice.
it's
the
new
series
in
new
york
court
of
appeals
456
and
my
quotation
is
at
page
460
and
that
was
summary
judgment,
bethlehem
steel
against
turner
construction.
ours
is
a
stronger
case
because
we're
in
the
hands
of
the
commission
and
we're
in
no
position
to
say
nor
is
there
anybody
else
here
i
think
that
the
commission
does
not
strictly
and
thoroughly
regulate
and
investigate.
that's
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
consumer
under
the
standards
of
this
court
in
the
whole
case
where
the
fair
return
and
the
interest
of
the
investor
must
also
be
considered.
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
before
i
sit
down
to
advert
one
point
which
is
received
undue
emphasis
in
the
respondent's
brief
connected
particularly
with
the
contract
history
of
my
client,
united
gas
pipeline
company.
now,
i
have
said
to
your
honors
that
we
had
difficulty
with
this
tariff
system.
we
first
tendered
a
form
of
tariff,
general
terms
and
conditions
and
service
agreement
in
may
1952
which
was
rejected
by
the
commission.
there
are
ensued
correspondents
between
us
and
the
commission
at
pages
283-289
of
the
record
concerning
that
rejection.
as
a
result
of
the
correspondence
and
with
anxiety
to
get
our
rates
filed
because
we
were
the
last
to
file,
we
eliminated
from
the
general
terms
and
conditions
of
our
tariff
certain
language
which
our
adversaries
say
is
essential
to
a
change
of
rate.
we
retained,
however,
that
language
is
at
page
289,
we
retained,
however,
the
language
that
i'm
talking
about
any
effective
superseding
rate
schedules.
now,
our
adversaries
says,
“if
at
the
time
you
found
your
tariff,
you
have
both
the
language
now
in
the
agreement
and
this
additional
language
which
talks
about
a
change
in
price
in
view
of
an
increase
in
cost
and
if
you
then
took
out
the
additional
language
upon
objection,
must
it
not
be
(a),
that
you
thought
the
additional
language
was
needed
to
give
you
flexibility
of
rate
and
(b)
that
you're
taking
it
out
to
price
of
your
flexibility.”
and
to
that,
we
say
not
so.
we
say,
the
elimination
of
the
language
was
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
deemed
by
the
commission
to
be
an
automatic
rate
escalation
of
power
of
increase
without
control.
we
say
that
because
that
is
what
--
those
are
words
contained
in
the
clause.
in
the
event,
an
increase
in
seller's
cost
and
so
on
seller
shall
have
the
right
to
revise
its
rate
to
reflect
such
change
and
we
say
that
additionally
because
our
adversaries
in
opposing
the
certiorari
so
construe
the
language.
they
said
in
their
brief
which
we
have
quoted
at
our
--
page
15
of
their
brief,
the
commission
objected
to
the
quoted
provision
as
an
attempt
by
united
to
reserve
the
right
to
change
the
rates
automatically
contrary
to
the
commission's
regulations.
now,
we,
as
i've
attempted
to
say
as
a
result
of
accepting
this
tariff
abandoned
the
idea
of
changing
rates
automatically
and
since
the
commission,
and
commission
and
counsel
here
construed
the
objected
language
as
affecting
an
automatic
change,
we
then
took
it
out
and
relied
upon
the
--
or
any
effective
superseding
rate
schedule
language
as
giving
as
the
change
by
filing
and
commission
action
upon
the
justification
by
cost
and
fair
return.
now,
i
thought
it
right
your
honors
to
call
your
attention
in
connection
with
the
administrative
interpretation
here.
the
fact
that
one
of
our
adversaries
was
then
on
the
staff
commission,
who
drafted
that
language
because
he
is
the
one
or
who
has
signed
the
brief
which
says
that
it
was
an
automatic
escalation
and
an
argument
before
the
commission
on
this
issue
he
said
at
page
1639,
commissioner
(inaudible)
will
recall
it
was
rejected.
the
staff
had
objected
to
certain
provisions
including
that
one
about
seller
shall
have
the
right
to
revise
its
rates
to
reflect
such
a
change.
the
staff
thought
that
was
a
proposal
by
united
to
automatically
change
the
rates
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
natural
gas
act.
then
he
went
on
to
say
--
nonetheless,
as
he
was
saying
today
–
tomorrow,
nonetheless,
we
argue
from
other
language
here,
an
admission
by
united
gas
corporation.
now,
my
submission
to
your
honors
is
under
the
well
settled
rules
of
administrative
interpretation,
the
commission
who
promulgated
the
tariff,
who
received
the
new
filing
who
have
--
have
continually
permitted
the
advocation
of
the
existing
language
as
we
claim
it
should
be
applied,
is
the
commission
who
heard
that
argument
from
a
former
member
of
their
staff
who
handled
the
correspondence
and
having
heard
it
determined
in
passages
of
the
record
which
are
now
in
our
brief
that
i
will
not
take
the
time
the
read,
determine
the
intent
of
the
parties
was
an
intent
for
flexible
change.
we
are
in
the
same
position
i
think
that
as
all
the
other
pipeline
companies
and
gas
companies
whose
existing
rates
and
whose
pending
increases
in
many
million
are
affected
will
be
affected
by
your
honor's
decision
of
this
appeal.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
by
way
of
correction
of
an
inadvertence
yesterday
and
for
the
record,
let
me
say
that
the
docket
number
of
the
10-year
section
5
(a)
proceeding
in
our
case
which
has
just
been
completed
is
g1142
and
not
1428.
the
facts
are
as
i
otherwise
stated.
and
before
i
go
too
far
from
the
chief
justice's
question,
let
me
by
way
of
supplement
to
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said
with
all
of
which
we
agree,
say
that
as
shown
in
our
reply
brief,
only
1.8%
of
all
united
gas
pipeline's
jurisdictional
sales
go
or
sale
or
resale
for
industrial
use
only.
now
that
is
another
term
of
argument,
if
the
court
please,
because
it's
the
language
of
congress.
direct
industrial
sales
are
not
subject
to
regulation.
sales
or
resale
only
are
subject
to
regulation
and
the
non-suspendability
clause
applies
in
section
4
--
in
section
4
to
sale
or
resale
for
industrial
use
only
what
is
usually
called
in
the
tariffs
an
i-rate
meaning
industrial
rate
or
interruptible
rate.
they
aren't
guaranteed
of
both
amendments
and
for
that
to
get
a
lower
price
and
they
buy
in
large
volume
and
their
large-volume
usage
usually
what
they
call
a
volumetric
rate
not
always,
of
course.
but
–
now
the
trick
in
the
statistics
is
this
as
our
reply
brief
shows
that
many
of
these
distributors
buy
it
from
us
and
other
pipelines
on
a
g-rate,
a
full
commodity
and
demand
schedule
with
a
specified
regular
billing
demand
and
supply
and
in
off-peak
periods
they
divert
some
of
that
consumer
gas
to
industrial
use.
now,
that's
not
the
sale
by
us
or
resale
for
industrial
use
only
therefore,
it's
not
a
non-suspendable
sale,
it's
a
suspendable
sale.
so,
counsel
can
tell
you
“oh,
we
resell,
it's
a
great
percentage
of
our
gas
for
industrial
use.”
they
don't
buy
it
from
us
for
resale
for
industrial
use
and
it's
a
great
deal
of
the
gas
that
they
sell
in
industries
is
suspendable
as
to
increased
rates.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
insofar
as
extended
as
a
legal
volume
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
the
legal
principle
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
as
a
matter
of
congressional
policy
sir.
now
a
question
was
asked
to
mr.
goldberg,
what
the
congressional
history
was?
and
he
said
it
was
so
slight
that
it
didn't
matter
as
i
understood
him.
on
the
contrary,
i
cited
in
our
brief
this
question
was
carefully
considered.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no
sir,
it's
on
our
main
brief
and
i
did
not
put
forth
the
quotations
and
i
do
not
think
i
should
take
rebuttal
time
to
read
the
quotations,
but
i
can
assure
your
honors
that
in
81
congressional
record
part
6,
page
6727,
congress
related
--
referred
to
the
industrial
sales
as
based
on
the
short
term
character
of
the
contracts
to
which
general
rankin
referred
and
at
a
subsequent
page
which
would
be
as
a
subsequent
to
that
the
introducer
of
the
bill,
mr.
lee,
described
the
construction
of
transmission
systems
and
the
necessity
of
getting
industrial
contracts
and
subsequently
in
the
same
part,
he
said,
"this
practice
of
the
commission's
has
permitted
the
natural
gas
companies
to
compete
for
industrial
fuel
business
and
that
produced
revenues
which
have
resulted
in
much
lower
schedules
of
natural
gas
rates
to
the
householder
then
the
rates
would
have
been
had
the
industrial
sales
have
not
been
made"
and
then
at
pages
1844-45
in
specific
answered
to
congressman
pettengill
in
connection
with
the
suspendability
point
and
the
natural
monopoly
of
electricity,
mr.
pettengill
said,
“and
he's
not
competition
the
best
regulator
price
there
is?"
and
the
witness
said,
"i
think
so,
i
think
that
is
true
to
mr.
pettengill."
and
you'll
find
them
in
the
senate
record
that
gas
--
that
gas
was
regarded
as
regulated
in
competition
by
coal
and
by
oil.
that's
the
reason,
your
honors
for
this
determined
policy
of
congress
which
has
not
been
changed.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
but
not
quoted
in
extense
your
honor,
but
the
history
is
there
as
a
determined
policy
of
congress
and
may
i
just
add
in
connection
with
the
escalated
cost
as
to
which
general
rankin
calls
attention.
your
honors,
bear
in
mind
that
these
users
of
industrial
non-suspendable
gas
had
protected
themselves
on
distribution
and
their
customers
have
accepted
the
protection
knowing
the
non-suspendability.
by
a
provision
or
rate
increases
to
the
consumer,
if
the
rate
goes
up
to
the
distributor,
that
means
that
the
existing
mechanism
of
rate
filings
has
been
understood
by
all
concerned
to
permit
increases
under
section
4.
another
example
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
suppose
the
availability
of
competing
fields
on
a
standby
basis
is
always
there.
they
get
lower
rates.
general
rankin
was
entirely
right
yesterday
in
giving
you
the
figures
in
the
pacific
northwest
in
washington
where
the
increased
rate
was
less
than
the
general
rate.
and
the
reason
is
i
think
really
that
everybody
has
recognized
as
the
commission
opinion
says
that
this
method
of
change
under
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedule
language
is
an
effective
method
accepted
by
everyone.
when
justice
douglas
asked
if
there
have
been
rulings
on
this
problem,
i
think
the
answer
was
literally
correct.
the
mobile
case
hadn't
been
decided
and
there
hadn't
been
a
motion
made
to
reject
a
filing
on
what
we
deem
in
this
application
of
the
mobile
case.
but
this
effective
superseding
rate
schedule
language
is
in
use
not
only
in
our
contracts,
but
in
the
contracts
of
nine
other
companies
whose
names
i
have
here
alone
and
has
been
in
use
since
1945
and
prior
as
is
shown
in
the
citations
on
page
53
in
our
brief
to
the
commission
record
at
no
doubt
at
the
time
when
mr.
goldberg
as
he
said
was
with
the
commission.
and
universally,
these
filings
have
been
acted
on,
recognized
and
received
as
a
medium
of
rate
change.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
continuously
and
rate
increases
acted
upon
accepted
both
of
course
as
to
reasonableness
or
accepted
as
the
propriety
of
filing
uniformly.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
for
prior
to
the
filing
it's
what
we
have
here
now.
of
course
the
proceeding
under
the
suspension
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
am
gratified
to
be
able
to
perform
on
court
that
the
proceeding
on
this
filing
9547
and
that's
on
the
subsequent
filing
which
i
warned
the
court
that
increased
costs
required
is
coming
into
a
completion
and
unless
this
court's
affirmance
to
the
decision
below
throws
the
proceeding
out,
the
work
will
not
have
been
wasted.
but
at
page
53
of
our
brief,
we
have
given
all
those
citations
and
the
prior
history
of
the
commission.
now,
i
was
slightly
surprised
to
hear
counsel
argue
to
the
court
that
the
filings
of
fact
below
were
wrong.
he
argued
contemporaneous
evidence.
he
argued
construction
by
conduct
and
other
matters
which
must
lead
to
our
brief.
all
those
matters
have
been
determined
by
the
commission
and
all
those
matters
as
i
think
have
been
accepted
by
the
court
below,
because
i
think
that
counsel
was
in
error
in
telling
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
court
below
had
not
reached
this
point.
i
think
at
page
257,
no
that's
not
the
correct
page.
i
will
refer
to
page
405
of
250,
f.2d
where
the
commission's
findings
that
the
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
record.
it's
in
my
appendix.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it's
at
page
267.
thank
you,
mr.
general
rankin
page
267
of
the
record.
the
commission
found
that
the
phrase
so
on
did
provide
the
consent
and
that
was
an
accurate
quotation
to
the
commission's
finding.
then
the
court
says,
in
effect
of
the
commission's
position
is
that
the
contractual
consent
to
the
act
of
filing
is
sufficient
for
section
4
(d).
i
respectfully
suggest
that
is
a
misstatement
of
what
the
commission
held
as
just
quote.
then
the
court
goes
on,
“correct
though
the
commission's
statement
that
the
parties
intent
maybe,
it
does
not
answer
the
question
and
go
on,
it
goes
on
to
the
point
of
law
which
it
was
deemed
erroneously.
this
court
has
decided
in
the
mobile
case.
at
page
269
of
the
record,
there
is
also
a
statement
by
the
court
below
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
albeit
some
of
those
customers
may
have
consented
to
the
act
of
filing.
now,
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
mr.
goldberg
told
justice
frankfurter
that
the
effective
superseding
orders
did
not
detract
from
the
validity
of
the
contract
and
the
contract
as
restated
by
him
without
those
would
have
permitted
to
find
he
had
considered
a
way
this
case
and
i
think
necessarily
so.
i
leave
to
our
brief
the
fact
pages
17
to
18
of
our
brief
every
word
effective,
superseding
on
file
comes
from
the
statute
or
the
regulations
which
are
binding
on
us.
i'm
interested
in
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
they're'
not
wholly
valid
but
your
honors
have
not
been
told
to
what
extent
they're
not
wholly
valid.
but
in
any
event,
those
words
are
terms
of
art
and
they
take
with
them
a
great
deal
of
history
and
your
honors
look
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
filings
--
the
beginning
of
this
book,
you
will
see
in
the
early
rate
schedules,
stamped
at
the
top
the
word
“superseded.”
one
of
the
words
in
the
regulations
showing
this
has
been
taken
away
and
the
new
schedule
has
taken
its
place
which
the
mississippi
valley
among
others
has
agreed
to
pay
according
to
the
new
rate.
i
called
your
attention
to
the
fact
also
that
the
court
in
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief
i'm
glad
to
say
of
texas
gas
and
southern
natural
who
concurred
with
us
in
the
interpretation
of
this
contract,
the
mississippi
valley
contract
service
agreement
among
others
having
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedule
language
has
also
the
sentence
which
your
honors
attention
has
not
been
called
early,
i
regret
i
must
sit
down
but
i
refer
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
112.
