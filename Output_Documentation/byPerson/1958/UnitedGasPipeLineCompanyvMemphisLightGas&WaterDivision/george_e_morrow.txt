mr.
george
e.
morrow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
advisable
at
this
time
to
start
out
with
a
free
statement
of
what
we
conceive
the
issues
in
this
case
to
be.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
position
which
memphis
brought
up
to
it
on
the
ground
that
united's
rates
--
united's
service
agreement
as
interpreted
by
united
and
the
commission
in
this
case
failed
to
validate
the
filings
which
united
made.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
below
held
that
assuming
that
united's
service
agreements
meant
just
exactly
what
united
and
the
commission
said
that
they
meant,
still
the
--
which
was
an
agreement
upon
a
rate
changing
procedure,
still
the
federal
power
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
under
the
natural
gas
act
as
interpreted
in
the
mobile
case
to
accept
such
a
filing
of
a
proposed
change
in
rate
and
to
consider
that
filing
and
to
grant
any
increase
on
the
strength
of
it.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
absolutely,
your
honor,
like
a
blanket.
in
the
division
of
argument
between
mr.
goldberg
and
myself,
i
will
be
discussing
the
facts
and
the
law
which
substantiate
the
holding
of
the
court
below
and
mr.
goldberg
will
take
up
the
second
leg
of
our
argument
in
which
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
contract
between
united
and
it's
customers
is
actually
subject
to
the
interpretation
placed
upon
it
by
the
department
--
by
the
pipelines
and
the
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
that
point.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
assuming
that
it
is
what
they
say
it
is,
we
still
find
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
commission
but
we
feel
that
the
--
as
a
--
as
an
alternate
ground
in
support
of
the
court's
decision
below,
if
it
had
gotten
to
that
question,
it
would
no
doubt
have
found
that
united's
--
the
pipelines
and
the
commission's
interpretation's
was
incorrect.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
believe
that's
substantially
correct,
your
honor.
where
the
rate
as
between
the
two
utility
companies
has
been
taken
out
of
the
realm
of
controversy
and
the
change
has
been
made
or
completed
by
the
pipeline
companies
--
by
the
--
by
the
two
utility
companies.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
view
that
the
federal
power
commission
does
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
intervene
in
the
rate
changing
process
itself.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that's
right,
your
honor
in
the
absence
of
agreement
upon
the
new
rate.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
upon
the
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
parties
to
the
proceeding
have
yet
been
completely
identified
in
the
court.
united
gas
pipeline
is
of
course
is
a
natural
gas
pipeline.
it
sells
gas
to
texas
gas
which
is
another
--
in
texas
gas
transmission
corporation,
another
pipeline
company
and
united
also
sells
gas
to
southern
natural
gas
company,
a
third
pipeline
company.
now,
it's
these
three
pipeline
companies
and
the
federal
power
commission
who
are
on
the
petitioner's
side
of
the
case.
the
respondents
are
the
memphis
white
gas
and
water
division,
a
distributor
of
gas
which
purchases
gas
from
texas
gas
and
therefore
indirectly
from
united.
and
of
course,
the
city
of
memphis
which
appears
as
representative
of
its
gas
consuming
public
and
the
mississippi
valley
gas
company
which
is
a
distributor
in
jackson,
mississippi
and
which
buys
gas
from
all
three
of
the
pipelines
involved
in
this
proceeding.
i'd
like
to
also
recommend
your
honor's
attention,
the
rendered
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
public
service
commission
in
the
state
of
california
are
supporting
our
position
and
also
the
attorney
general
of
washington,
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin,
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee,
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi,
national
association
--
national
institute
--
municipal
league
offices
and
the
city
of
edinburg.
i'd
like
to
get
down
to
the
facts
in
this
case
as
they
appear
on
the
record
of
this
case.
united
gas
pipeline
on
september
30th,
1955
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission
an
increase
--
schedules
of
increased
rates
which
purported
to
increase
their
rates
by
a
total
of
--
a
jurisdictional
rate
by
a
total
of
approximately
$10
million.
at
the
time
united
filed
this
filing
with
the
federal
power
commission,
there
was
not
a
single
one
of
its
customers
who
even
knew
what
the
new
rates
were
going
to
be.
there
was
no
customer
of
united
which
had
given
its
consent
or
agreement
to
the
rates
which
united
filed.
and
to
this
good
day,
there
is
not
one
single
customer
of
united
that
has
consented
or
agreed
to
the
rates
filed
by
united
in
this
case.
there
is
no
consensual
agreement
whatsoever
between
united
and
any
of
its
customers,
no
agreement
to
pay
the
rates
which
united
filed
and
that
is
admitted
by
all
parties
to
this
proceeding.
now,
what
--
if
--
if
there
is
no
consent
to
the
new
rates,
then
what
--
where
does
united
get
its
right
to
file?
well,
it
gets
it
from
its
contracts
or
purports
to
--
and
particularly,
from
the
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
language
contract.
now,
i'd
like
to
by
way
of
a
word
of
caution,
i
am
assuming
now
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
that
the
effective
superseding
rates
schedules
provision
contain
all
of
the
worlds
of
meaning
which
has
been
poured
into
it
by
united
and
the
pipe
--
other
pipelines
by
implication
and
inference.
we
don't,
for
one
minute
agreed
that
this
is
the
correct
interpretation.
this
is
the
interpretation
which
united
placed
upon
it
in
the
record
in
this
cause.
the
court
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
the
interpretation
was
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct.
because
it
is
so
important
in
this
case
and
because
the
interpretation
which
the
parties
--
the
pipelines
put
on
united
service
agreements
in
the
commission,
there
is
only
a
remote
resemblance
to
the
interpretation
which
they
seem
to
put
on
the
same
contracts
in
their
briefs
in
this
court,
i'd
like
to
take
the
time
to
read
what
united
said
about
its
contracts
just
very
briefly
from
the
record,
it's
also
at
page
25
of
our
brief.
it's
on
the
record
on
153
and
154.
here's
what
united
told
the
federal
power
commission
was
the
meaning
and
intent
of
the
words
effective
superseding
rights
schedule
of
the
agreement
(inaudible)
schedule.
it
was
any
of
the
intent
and
meaning
of
such
language
and
were
so
understood
by
the
parties
that
such
provision
contemplated
freedom
and
right
by
united
to
sell
the
file
with
federal
power
commission
pursuant
to
section
4
(d)
of
the
act,
notice
the
change
in
rates
with
consequent
freedom
and
right
in
mississippi
valley,
texas
gas,
southern
natural
and
all
of
the
similarly
situated
to
oppose
and
contest
both
the
propriety
and
the
lawfulness
of
the
notice
changed
in
rates.
notice
your
honors
that
the
right
to
oppose
and
contest
was
consequent.
it
was
a
correlative
contract
right.
united
goes
on
the
say
in
another
paragraph,
“thus,
there
was
mutual
understanding
and
agreement
that
effective
rates
and
offending
tariff
was
subject
to
notice
of
change
filed
with
the
commission,
skipping,
followed
by
full
right
to
oppose
and
contest
such
change
or
review
with
the
effective
tariff
rates
superseded
by
such
things
in
tariff
rates
as
became
effective
pursuant
to
commission
review
and
determination
of
the
contest,
if
any,
of
the
propriety
and
lawfulness
of
the
notice
change.
now,
texas
gas
was
in
such
complete
agreement
with
united
at
that
stage
in
the
proceedings
that
it
simply
adopted
united's
language,
verbatim
as
its
own
interpretation
of
a
contract.
united
went
on
with
specific
reference
to
its
contract
with
mississippi
valley
and
--
and
on
page
26,
we
see
where
they
again
emphasized
that
the
purchaser
under
the
contract,
the
purchaser
was
free
to
oppose
and
contest
any
noticed
change.
southern
natural,
united
of
a
customer
wanted
to
the
same
kind
of
service
agreement
was
of
the
same
opinion
in
the
commission.
you
can
see
at
the
page
27
of
our
brief
where
southern
natural
says
that
the
effective
superseding
rates
schedule
provision
right
grants
to
united
the
right
to
file
with
the
commission
under
the
provisions
of
section
4
(d)
changes
in
rates
schedules
under
which
southern
purchases
natural
gas
subject
of
course
to
southern's
right
to
oppose
any
such
change
rates
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
in
respect
thereto
initiated
under
the
section
4
(e)
and
5
(a)
of
the
act.
now,
all
of
the
statements
by
the
pipelines
involved
united's
about
its
own
contract
contained
three
particular
points.
it's
a
sort
of
three-point
arrangement.
united
was
to
have
the
contract
right
to
file
a
change
in
rates.
the
purchasers
were
to
have
the
correlative
and
coequal
contract
right
to
oppose
and
contest
that
filing
and
the
federal
power
commission
was
to
be
the
one
that
made
the
decision.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
under
the
statute
your
honor,
their
right
to
contest
would
depend
upon
the
discretion
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
a
proceeding
under
section
4.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
federal
power
commission
permits
intervention
in
accordance
with
its
discretion.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
--
i'll
try
to
make
it
appear
to
your
honor
that
the
very
purpose
having
the
significance
of
it
is
this,
that
if
there
was
a
contract
right
on
the
part
of
the
parties
to
oppose
and
contest
this
rate,
then,
there
could
not
have
been
any
contract
obligation
on
the
parties
to
pay
the
rate
at
the
time
it
was
filed.
you
couldn't
have
a
contract
obligation
to
do
the
very
thing
that
you
had
a
contract
right
to
oppose.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
the
--
section
4
of
the
statute
says
that
states,
municipalities,
public
service
commissions
and
so
forth
have
the
right
to
intervene
in
the
section
4
proceeding.
natural
gas
companies
have
the
petition
to
the
commission
for
--
for
intervention
and
the
commission
permits
them
to
intervene
because
the
orders
always
say
intervention
maybe
in
the
public
interest.
now,
in
section
5
and
this
will
become
--
the
significance
of
this
will
become
important
later,
in
section
5
proceedings,
the
natural
gas
company
has
the
absolute
right
to
intervene
to
distribute
of
customers.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
think
that's
a
matter
of
the
commissions'
practice,
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
out
i
want
to
emphasize
is
though
as
a
matter
of
contract
right
the
point
in
the
parties,
there
was
this
right
to
oppose
and
contest
the
new
rates.
now,
where
you
have
a
contract
agreement
whereby
one
party
may
propose
a
change
or
file
a
change,
the
other
party
has
the
contract
right
to
oppose
that
and
a
third
party
has
a
right
to
decide
the
issue,
you
have
an
arrangement
with
all
the
characteristics
of
an
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that
is
precisely
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes
sir,
that
is
correct,
sir
because
absent
the
so
called
consent
in
the
contract,
we've
got
the
precise
mobile
case.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes
sir.
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
present
makes
no
difference.
the
presence
of
the
right
to
file
makes
no
difference
which
i
think
i
can
make
it
clear.
let
me
get
back
to
this
business
of
just
exactly
what
kind
of
a
preacher
this
contract
between
the
parties
was.
it
was
an
arbitration
proceeding
and
southern
natural,
one
of
the
parties
to
the
contract
conceded
and
stated
to
the
federal
power
commission
that
this
was
an
arbitration
procedure
used
just
those
words.
it
says
that
there's
no
reason
in
the
law
or
in
common
sense
while
a
natural
gas
company
may
not
lawfully
agree
that
the
right
specified
in
the
contract
maybe
submitted
to
arbitration
by
either
of
the
parties.
and
it
went
on
to
say,
that
is
exactly
what
has
been
done
in
this
case.
so
the
contracts,
it
went
on
to
say
clearly
contemplate
that
the
seller
may
submit
of
the
commission
on
the
section
4
(d)
changes
in
rates
with
the
commission
acting
as
the
arbitrator
between
the
parties
under
its
powers
granted
by
section
4
(d)
and
4
(e).
now,
i
might
say
that
ever
since
that's
done,
southern
natural
and
texas
gas
have
been
backing
away
from
that
term
arbitration
from
the
recognition
that
all
this
was
on
agreement
to
an
arbitration
procedure
and
they
have
finally
come
to
full
circle
and
in
their
briefs
now,
they
spend
several
pages
to
explain
why
it
couldn't
possibly
be
an
arbitration
procedure,
but
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
is
the
record
in
the
clause.
this
is
the
record
upon
in
which
the
commission
made
its
decision
and
it
is
the
record
upon
which
this
court
of
course
must
make
its
decision.
now,
the
three
pipeline
parties
then
were
in
full
agreement
before
the
commission
as
to
what
their
contracts
meant.
incidentally,
the
commissions
conceived
the
issue
in
this
case
as
primarily
an
issue
of
contract
construction
as
to
what
the
contracts
mean.
the
commission
adopted
the
pipelines'
interpretation
completely
and
wholly.
now,
in
adopting
it,
it
of
course
realize
of
what
united
was
really
filing
was
a
proposal,
a
proposal
for
an
increase
in
rates
subject
to
the
opposition
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
it
could
not
have
been
a
change
to
rate
because
there's
no
one
who
agreed
to
pay
that
rate.
they
couldn't
have
been
a
contractual
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
oh,
but
your
honor,
that's
just
exactly
what
your
honor's
opinion
in
mobile
held
that
you
could
not
do.
the
natural
gas
act
gives
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
they're
getting
--
the
natural
gas
act
said
the
opinion
gives
no
right
or
power
to
a
natural
gas
company
to
file
a
change
in
rate.
there
is
no
one
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
mobile
opinion
and
stating
that
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act
provides
no
rate
changing
procedure.
and,
since
it
provides
no
rate
change
and
procedure,
that's
exactly
what
united
was
trying
to
do
in
the
mobile
case
to
make
a
filing
which
--
of
a
rate
which
have
not
been
agreed
to
by
the
parties.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
and
your
honor,
i
found
that
united
could
not
abrogate
that
rate.
i
mean
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
it
could
not
abrogate
--
well,
it
could
not
file
the
new
rate.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
but
the
holding
was
that
the
filing
was
a
nullity.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
your
honor
went
in
to
a
very
full
analysis
of
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
showed
that
united
could
not
do
what
it
wanted
to
do
there
because
it
was
attempting
to
use
section
4
as
a
rate
changing
procedure.
and
the
natural
gas
act
provided
no
rate
changing
procedure.
and
therefore,
there
was
--
and
furthermore,
that
the
review
of
power
of
the
commission
was
the
sole
power
over
rates
that
the
commission
had,
not
the
power
to
participate
in
the
rate
changing
process
between
the
companies.
to
get
back
to
the
commission's
filing
--
the
commission's
finding
in
this
case,
the
commission
recognized,
so
clearly
recognized
that
this
was
a
proposal
that
it
use
the
word
proposal
four
times
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
in
referring
to
united's
proposed
rate.
thus,
as
we
show
at
page
28
of
our
brief,
the
changes
contemplated
by
the
agreements
than
the
commission
were
unilateral
changes
to
be
proposed
by
united
and
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
opinion
it
wound
up,
united's
proposal
for
increase
rate
in
this
proceeding
does
not
constitute
a
prohibited
unilateral
change
of
a
contract.
so,
the
commission
clearly
recognized
that
united's
filing
was
nothing,
but
a
proposal
as
it
had
to
be
if
it
was
an
arbitration
proceeding
and
the
customers
have
the
same
right
to
oppose
a
right
correlative
and
co-equal
to
rights
of
(inaudible).
so,
from
there,
the
case
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
defining
was
made
just
exactly
as
united
and
the
commission
argued
their
rates
was
that
all
they
had
agreed
upon
was
the
right
file,
in
other
words,
the
right
to
make
the
arbitration
proposal.
and
then
after
a
careful
review
of
this
court's
opinion
in
mobile,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
on
agreement
upon
the
right
to
make
the
proposal
which
did
not
take
the
rates
out
of
the
realm
of
controversy
between
the
parties,
but
attempted
to
drag
the
federal
power
commission
down
into
the
rate
controversy
between
the
two
utilities,
that
that
sort
of
an
agreement
simply
was
not
sufficient
to
make
these
rates
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
the
federal
power
commission
said
the
mobile
opinion
does
not
work
on
proposals.
section
4
provides
much
for
the
filing
of
proposal
and
therefore
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
commission
in
this
case
to
undertake
the
arbitration
of
the
contract
between
the
parties.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
want
to
go
into
a
very
thorough
discussion
with
the
court,
if
i
may,
on
the
subject
of
the
mobile
case
because
we
have
studied
it
carefully,
obviously
the
court
of
appeals
studied
it
carefully
and
we've
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
mobile
case
does
not
permit
the
filing
of
the
kind
of
rates
which
united
filed
in
this
case.
but
i
see
that
it's
4:30
at
this
time
so
i'll
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
--
take
that
up
tomorrow.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
there
was
a
question
from
the
bench
to
the
effect
can
natural
gas
companies
change
their
rates
by
any
means
to
their
customers
without
the
customer's
consent
under
our
theory
of
this
matter.
and
the
answer
of
which
i
gave
was
“no,”
in
solely
in
the
reference
of
section
4
of
the
act.
now,
it
is
of
course
quite
clear
that
natural
gas
companies
can
change
their
rights
--
their
rates
without
their
customer's
consent
even
their
contract
rates
anytime
that
they
can
convince
the
commission
that
they
deserve
an
increase
in
proceedings
under
section
5
(a)
of
the
act.
that
is
the
remedy
which
this
court
said
in
the
mobile
case
was
always
available
to
a
natural
gas
company,
whose
rates
were
too
low
to
enable
it,
to
carry
on
its
public
service
functions
properly.
now,
the
answer
to
that
question
leads
me
into
maybe
putting
my
last
chapter
first
as
it
were
so
that
i
can
explain
to
the
court
just
what
we
are
driving
at,
just
what
the
system
of
regulation
under
section
4
and
5
of
the
act
was
intended
to
be
by
congress
as
we
see
it.
i
think
it
becomes
clear
from
what
i've
already
said
just
now,
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
united
should
have
filed
under
or
should
have
applied
for
a
rate
increase
under
section
5
of
the
act
instead
of
as
it
did
under
section
4
of
the
act.
there's
no
question
that
if
united
had
a
need
for
a
rate
increase
that
it
could
get
it.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
could
get
it
under
section
5
or
under
section
4.
now,
what's
the
difference?
what's
the
practical
difference
between
these
two
procedures?
well,
section
5
of
the
act
is
an
administrative
procedure
whereby
the
federal
power
commission
in
its
role
as
the
protector
of
the
consumer
interest,
the
public
interest
investigates
the
rate
of
a
natural
gas
company
to
determine
whether
that
rate
conforms
to
the
public
interest.
and
if
the
rate
does
not
conform
to
the
public
interest,
then
the
federal
power
commission
issues
an
order
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings
which
modifies
the
rate
to
make
it
conform.
and
the
new
rate
thus
modified
goes
into
effect
from
and
after
the
date
of
the
final
order
in
the
proceedings.
now,
the
principal
difference
under
section
4
has
to
do
with
the
refund
procedure.
under
section
4
of
the
act
the
commission
also
exercises
the
same
rate
review
power
which
it
exercised
under
section
5,
but
it
--
and
--
and
it's
reviewing
the
existing
rates
of
natural
gas
companies.
the
only
difference
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that's
exactly
what
i'm
getting
to
your
honor,
right
now.
the
difference
is
the
time
when
the
rate
goes
into
effect.
under
a
section
4
proceeding,
if
the
commission
suspends
the
rate,
then
it
goes
into
effect
five
months
later.
at
least
it
goes
into
provisional
effect.
it's
a
sort
of
a
pendente
lite
effect
because
at
the
end
of
the
proceedings,
the
commission
again,
after
having
fully
considered
the
rate,
again
issues
its
order
might
find
the
rate
to
conform
to
the
public
interest.
but
there,
its
order
had
made
retroactive
by
this
refund
procedure,
because
if
the
rate
which
is
filed
is
higher
than
it
ought
to
be
according
to
the
commission's
final
order,
then
the
excess
has
to
be
scrapped
off
and
refunded
to
the
customer.
so,
that
the
effect
is
that
you've
only
had
one
rate
in
effect
all
the
time.
so,
the
difference
between
--
practical
difference
between
section
5
and
section
4,
is
that
the
rate
goes
into
effect
earlier
in
a
section
4
proceeding.
it's
what
you
might
call
a
quicker
proceeding
and
section
5
the
slower
proceeding.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor
has
again
gotten
right
to
the
point
ahead
on
me.
section
5
proceedings
historically
have
taken
a
long
time.
the
commission
in
its
brief
cites
horrible
examples
up
to
five
years
or
six
years
in
which
it
has
taken,
but
i
submit
your
honor
that
section
5
proceedings
need
not
take
that
long.
you
see,
as
chairman
kuykendall
of
the
commission
has
pointed
out
since
the
decision
in
the
lower
court,
if
a
section
5
proceeding
is
being
used
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
up
to
this
time,
section
5
proceedings
have
only
being
used
to
decrease
the
rates
of
natural
gas
companies.
so,
that
the
decreased
rate
does
not
go
into
effect
until
the
end
of
the
section
5
proceeding.
well,
quite
obviously,
the
natural
gas
company
is
not
anxious
for
the
proceeding
to
end.
as
--
as
mr.
kuykendall,
chairman
of
the
commission
said
the
pipelines
have
been
running
away
from
the
commission
in
these
five-day
proceedings
up
to
now.
and
he
points
out
that
there
might
be
--
that
it
might
be
possible
to
process
them
in
a
very
much
shorter
time
where
the
pipeline
company
wants
an
increase
and
is
running
with
the
commission
cooperating
with
the
commission
staff
in
every
way
and
working
to
get
the
--
the
proceedings
to
a
conclusion.
nevertheless,
even
in
that
sort
of
a
situation,
the
chances
are
that
a
section
5
proceeding,
the
rate
is
still
the
slower
proceeding
of
the
two,
the
rate
goes
into
effect
later.
now,
this
brings
me
down
to
--
to
really
what
we're
aiming
at.
what
we
are
asking
is
what
we
think
congress
intended
was
nothing
more
than
a
fair
break
to
the
natural
gas
company
and
the
distributor
company.
we
expect
--
we
--
we
think
that
congress
intended
to
put
them
on
the
same
procedural
level.
here's
what
i
mean
by
that.
up
until
this
time,
section
5
(a)
has
always
been
the
proceeding
by
which
a
customer
can
get
a
decrease
in
rate.
section
5
(a)
specifically
provides
that
a
natural
gas
company
which
thinks
it's
rates
are
too
high
can
go
to
the
commission
and
--
in
effect,
this
what
happen
–
happens.
the
company
goes
to
the
commission
and
says,
“mr.
commission,
we
are
bound
by
a
long-term
contract
without
natural
gas
supplier
and
these
rates
we
think
are
too
high.
they're
not
in
the
public
interest.
won't
you
mr.
commission
exercise
your
regulatory
jurisdiction,
investigate
these
rates
and
if
you
find
that
too
high,
won't
you
give
us
relief
in
the
public
interest
regardless
of
our
contracts
because
you've
got
the
paramount
power
over
those
in
the
public
interest.”
now
under
a
section
5
proceeding
as
illuminated
by
the
mobile
case,
the
natural
gas
company
which
wants
an
increase
can
do
exactly
the
same
thing.
it
also
goes
to
the
commission
and
says,
“mr.
commission,
we
are
bound
by
our
long-term
contracts
with
our
customers”
and
may
i
pause
to
say
that
there's
nothing
involved
in
this
case
except
long-term
contracts,
but
all
of
the
united
jurisdictional
contracts
are
long-term
contracts.
“we
are
bound
by
our
long-term
contracts
to
our
jurisdictional
costumers.
we
think
we
deserve
an
increase
but
our
customer
won't
agree
to
that
increase.
now,
won't
you
mr.
commission”
says
the
pipeline,
“won't
you
investigate
our
present
existing
rates
and
if
you
find
that
they
are
so
low,
that
they
are
not
--
that
they
interfere
with
our
ability
to
carry
out
our
public
utility
function,
won't
you
grant
us
the
right
to
increase
those
rates,”
filed
under
section
4.
now,
you
see
in
that
way,
for
the
first
time,
the
public
--
that
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company
and
the
distributor
company
are
placed
on
exactly
the
same
procedural
point.
the
distributor
company's
right
to
a
decrease
is
just
as
great,
just
as
firm
as
the
--
in
--
in
a
case
where
it
deserves
it
as
the
natural
gas
company's
right
to
an
increase
is
in
the
case
where
the
natural
gas
company
deserves
it.
so
all
this
does,
this
proceeding
that
we
think
united
should
have
taken,
all
it
does
is
to
put
the
pipelines
on
the
same
procedural
plane
with
the
distributor,
the
distributor
who
directly
serves
the
consumer,
the
consumer,
who
is
the
darling
of
congress.
the
consumer
who's
protection
was
the
primary
purpose
of
the
natural
gas
act.
that's
all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
decide
in
this
case.
that
when
there
has
been
no
agreed
upon
increase
between
the
pipeline
and
its
contract
costumers,
they
go
under
section
5.
when
there
has
been
no
agreed
upon
decrease,
between
the
pipeline
and
its
contract
costumer,
the
customer
goes
in
under
section
5.
now,
that
--
that
makes
everything
in
the
act
fall
into
place.
it
gives
everything
a
reasonableness.
for
instance,
let's
take
the
same
thing
over
to
section
4.
there,
congress
has
an
effect
said,
“let
the
utilities
see
if
they
can
work
it
out
first.”
now,
if
the
two
utility
companies
can
get
together
on
a
rate
increase,
if
the
pipeline
can
convince
its
costumer
that
it's
entitled
to
a
rate
increase
and
the
costumer
agrees
to
it,
then
you've
got
an
agreed
upon
rate.
then
the
pipeline
can
file
that
new
agreed
upon
rate
with
the
commission
under
section
4
in
the
quicker
proceeding.
or
by
the
same
token,
if
the
costumer
convinced
the
pipeline
that
the
pipeline's
rate
is
too
high,
then
you
agree
upon
a
lower
rate.
and
the
lower
rate
goes
into
effect
under
section
4
in
the
quicker
procedure.
now,
this
makes
sense.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
within
a
non-agreed
upon
increase,
yes
your
honor
because
if
that
happened,
it
would
simply
put
the
industrial
rates
in
the
same
category
with
all
other
rates
and
i've
been
talking
about
all
the
other
rates
up
till
now.
now,
let's
see
what
sense
that
makes
in
terms
of
the
congressional
intent.
here
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
two
public
utilities
dealing
with
each
other,
the
pipeline
and
the
distributor.
now,
congress
says
that
if
these
two
public
utilities
can
get
together
and
agree
upon
a
rate
which
they
as
between
themselves
think
is
reasonable
and
then
file
that
rate
with
the
commission,
isn't
there
a
--
a
reasonable
warrant
or
basis
or
at
least
temporary
presumption
that
that
rate
is
reasonable?
and
therefore,
isn't
it
appropriate
to
allow
the
new
rate
to
go
into
effect
under
barn
so
it's
in
effect
while
the
commission
acting
in
it's
capacity
as
protector
of
the
public
interest,
the
third
party
in
interest
to
those
contracts
investigates
this
new
completed
contract
to
see
whether
it
serves
the
public
as
it
should.
on
the
other
hand,
suppose
the
two
utility
companies,
the
parties
directly
involved
in
the
rate
have
not
been
able
to
get
together
on
what
they
consider
is
a
reasonable
rate
then
isn't
it
reasonable
that
the
new
rates
sought
--
whether
the
higher
rates
sought
by
the
pipeline
or
the
lower
rate
sought
by
the
costumer,
the
distributor,
isn't
it
reasonable
that
the
new
rate
should
have
to
prove
itself
as
it
were
in
the
course
of
the
commission
proceedings
before
the
commission
order
makes
it
effective?
the
whole
act
begins
to
take
form
and
shape
and
all
we're
asking,
i
repeat
once
more,
is
an
even
break
for
the
distributor
and
the
pipeline.
the
distributor
under
this
theory
has
the
same
rights
to
a
decrease
as
--
as
the
pipeline
does
to
an
increase
and
this
gives
him
correlative
remedies
to
go
along
with
those
correlative
rights,
to
a
non--agreed
upon
right,
correlative
remedies
under
section
4
to
an
agreed
upon
right.
now,
the
question
is
raised
about
the
ex
parte
rates
and
i
like
to
quote
from
the
court's
opinion
just
what
was
said
in
mobile
about
this
business
of
ex
parte
rates
because
a
great
deal
has
been
said
in
the
commission's
--
well,
in
all
the
briefs
about
it
and
i
think
that
they
have
completely
misunderstood
the
impact
of
what
the
court
said.
the
court
was
saying
in
section,
it
was
discussing
in
section
4,
the
fact
that
the
natural
gas
act
did
not
change
the
contractual
powers
of
natural
gas
companies,
did
not
interfere
with
or
changed
the
rate
making
or
rate
changing
powers
of
natural
gas
companies
and
it
followed
that
up
by
this
sentence
which
is
found
in
page
343
of
the
opinion.
the
obvious
implication
is
that
except
as
specifically
limited
by
the
act,
the
rate
making
powers
of
natural
gas
companies
would
be
no
different
from
those
they
would
possess
in
the
absence
of
the
act,
it's
in
the
(inaudible),
to
establish
ex
parte
and
change
at
will
rates
offered
to
prospective
customers
or
to
fix
by
contract
and
change
only
by
mutual
agreement
the
rate
agreed
upon
with
a
particular
customer.
now,
which
one
of
those
alternatives
do
we
fall
under
in
this
court?
may
it
please
the
court
there
is
not
a
single
prospective
customer
in
the
picture
in
this
case.
every
single
customer
is
a
long-term
contract
customer
of
united.
therefore,
we
are
obviously
within
the
second
alternative
where
united
has
no
right
to
file
an
ex
parte
rate
to
us,
but
must
fix
by
contract
and
change
only
by
mutual
agreement
the
rate
which
is
agreed
upon
with
these
particular
customers.
the
court
also
said,
oh,
and
--
and
let
me
pause
there
to
say
that
it
seemed
to
appear
from
the
argument
of
opposing
counsel
that
what
we
were
trying
to
do
was
to
demolish
the
commission's
regulations.
now,
i
grant
that
i
said
what
mr.
carson
quoted
me
as
saying
that
under
the
--
in
the
light
of
the
mobile
decision,
there
might
need
to
be
some
modifications
of
the
commission's
regulations,
but
those
are
minor.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
general
scope
intent
in
purpose
of
the
commission's
regulations
as
explained
by
general
rankin.
now,
we
do
have
quarrel
with
the
message
there
set
forth
in
the
briefs
but
if
you
will
recall,
general
rankin
said
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
regulations
was
to
take
these
sheets
of
contracts
and
he
showed
how
thick
it
was,
a
lot
of
different
complicated
contracts
which
united
had
with
all
its
customers
and
reduced
it
down
to
this
much
contract
to
put
all
of
the
contractual
arrangements
between
the
parties
into
a
uniform
format
prescribed
by
the
commission
and
that
was
the
only
purpose
of
the
regulation.
and
that
was
the
purpose
that
the
commission
said
at
the
time
that
promulgated
the
regulations
as
their
only
purpose
and
we
quote
them
at
86
of
our
brief,
"a
presiding
examiner's
statement
which
was
adopted
in
toto
by
the
commission."
it
said
the
commission's
purpose
in
promulgating
order
number
144,
which
of
course
promulgated
these
regulations,
was
precisely
as
it
stated
in
its
explanatory
opinion
therewith
that
the
proposed
amendment
of
the
general
rules
and
regulations
was
for
the
sole
purpose
of
achieving
uniformity
and
simplicity
with
respect
to
form,
composition
and
filing
of
schedules
of
rights
and
charges
for
the
transportation
and
sale
for
resale
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
solely
a
matter
of
form,
and
as
a
matter
of
form,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
it
at
all.
it
was
a
splendid
idea
to
get
all
of
these
complicated
contracts
down
to
a
simple
uniform
format.
so,
the
--
the
commission's
argument
which
it
attempts
to
launch
from
its
regulations
on
the
basis
of
its
regulations
just
simply
won't
stand
up
in
the
light
of
which
the
commission
has
already
said
about
those
regulations.
it's
clear
that
actually
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
this.
in
the
mobile
case,
the
commission
came
to
the
court
saying
united
has
a
right
to
file
this
unilateral
change
in
its
contract
because
the
natural
gas
act,
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act
by
providing
a
rate
changing
procedure
confers
upon
at
that
right.
that
was
the
commission's
argument
in
mobile.
and
this
court
said,
"no,
it's
no
such
thing.
section
4
is
not
a
rate
changing
procedure".
section
4
provides
not
for
proposals.
the
scope
of
the
commission's
review
power
under
section
4
is
the
same
as
it
is
under
section
5
to
review
the
existing
rates
of
natural
gas
company
and
to
make
it
crystal
clear,
the
court
pointed
out
in
mobile
that
section
4
provides
no
more
than,
let's
see,
provides
no
more
than
that
otherwise
valid
rates,
and
if
i
may,
here
it's
on
page
339,
it
starts
right
at
the
bottom
of
339.
in
short,
section
4
(d)
on
its
face
indicates
no
more
than
that
otherwise
valid
changes
cannot
be
put
into
effect
without
giving
the
required
notice
to
the
commission.
now,
how
does
it
change
yet
to
be
an
otherwise
valid
change,
it's
between
these
two
utility
companies,
very
simple.
let's
--
let's
take
for
instance
just
to
make
it
concrete,
united
and
mississippi
valley,
united's
customer
company.
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
rate
in
this
case
by
united,
it
had
a
long-term
contract
with
mississippi
valley
and
mississippi
was
purchasing
gas
from
it
at
a
certain,
specific,
well
understood,
agreed
upon
price.
now,
obviously,
the
price
was
the
very
heart
of
that
contract.
it
was
integral
part
of
the
contract
and
they
were
purchasing
gas
at
a
price
which
had
been
contracted
for
and
agreed
upon.
now,
united
wants
to
substitute
a
new
rate
for
the
rate
which
they
have
agreed
upon
and
have
been
observing
for
several
years.
how
can
it
make
that
substituted
rate
valid?
there's
only
one
way.
united
has
got
to
find
somewhere,
somehow
an
agreement
on
the
part
of
its
co-contractor
to
pay
the
substitute
rate.
and
that's
why
at
the
outset
of
this
case
of
my
argument
here,
i
dwelt
upon
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
agreement
on
the
part
of
mississippi
valley,
texas
gas,
southern
natural,
any
other
customer
of
united
to
pay
the
rate
which
united
filed
in
this
case.
the
rate
is
not
an
otherwise
valid
rate.
the
rate
is
nothing
more
than
a
proposal
on
the
part
of
united
which
draws
the
commission
into
the
vortex
of
the
rate
controversy
between
these
two
public
utility
companies
and
that's
the
rate,
i
mean,
that's
under
the
contract
as
construed
by
united.
actually,
you
might
say
our
ultimate
position
in
this
case
goes
even
deeper
than
that
and
that
is
that
with
effective
superseding
rate
schedules
provision
cannot
contain
and
cannot
be
interpreted
to
contain
all
of
the
tremendous
volumes
of
significance
which
has
been
implied
into
it
and
inferred
into
it
by
the
parties
to
this
case
and
for
that
argument,
i
will
turn
it
over
to
mr.
goldberg.
thank
you.
