you

addressing

argument
of

that

there
would
be
a
refund
of
any
access
that
they
found
to
be
beyond
the
public
interest.
now,
would
you
--
would
you
mind
telling
me
if
i
--
if
i
understood
you
correctly
yesterday
or
whether
there
are
some
circumstances
where
there
will
not
be
any
refunds
in
the
event
the
commission
finds
that
the
new
filings
where
not
in
a
public
interest.

figures
