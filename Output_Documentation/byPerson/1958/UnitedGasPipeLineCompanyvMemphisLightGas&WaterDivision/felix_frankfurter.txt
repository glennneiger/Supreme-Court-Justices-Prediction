do
you
mean
the
tariff
includes
both?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
again
the
incidence
of
exclusively
industrial
rates
where
they're
not
suspendable
in
the
whole
network
of
the
industry
rate
of
prices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
the
law
but
the
practicality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
quantity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carson,
what
inference
(inaudible)
draw
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
your
recital
for
the
last
two
minutes
from
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
to
infer
to
what
you've
just
said
that
it
is
your
view
that
mobile
governed
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
question
here
there
was
a
term
of
a
change,
rates
or
the
terms
of
the
rates
(inaudible).
it
is
the
absence
of
agreement
to
change
the
existing
rate
under
which
service
was
rendered
in
the
absence
of
agreement,
it
wasn't
called
the
(inaudible)
the
two
utilities,
there
is
no
power
in
the
part
of
the
commission
to
accept
the
filing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
upon
the
new
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
terms
of
the
rates
or
changes,
et
cetera
are
besides
the
present
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
they
find
--
they
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
suggest
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
the
federal
power
commission
would
be
free
not
to
the
deal
in
opposition
to
be
not
to
the
fact
of
filing
but
the
validation
of
what
was
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
understand
it,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
decide
the
fact
that
they
--
they
just
derived
from
the
contract?
i
don't
quite
appreciate
the
significance
of
your
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ask
you
again
mr.
morrow,
i
don't
understand
it.
wouldn't
they
have
all
the
right
to
oppose
if
not
given
by
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
oppose
the
going
(inaudible)
the
change
rates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
denial
by
the
commission
did
exercise
only
if
the
interest
of
the
--
depends
on
the
intervener
is
not
otherwise
protected
for
them,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
it
is
--
why
is
everybody
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
absolute
that
--
when
you
say
absolute,
that
it
would
have
more
meaning
and
that
the
presence
of
it
makes
no
difference
to
mobile?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
argument
that
instead
of
the
phrase
as
founded
the
service
agreement
which
you're
addressing
yourself,
the
word
were
these,
under
settled
rate
schedules
or
any
rate
that
maybe
subsequently
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission,
would
that
make
a
difference
to
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
any
rates
that
maybe
subsequently
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission,
would
that
make
a
difference
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
wouldn't
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it
be
effective
to
be
in
there
by
force
of
law?
no
rates
can
be
--
no
rate
is
determined
unless
it's
effective
according
to
the
determination
by
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
agree
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
not
agree
to
that
because
of
the
controlling
power
of
the
commission
determined
the
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
they
mean
by
effective.
effective
means
that
which
the
regulatory
body
determines
eventually
is
the
legally
and
plausible
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
to
you
is,
whether
effectiveness
isn't
necessarily
qualify
in
every
agreement
between
parties?
so,
no
amount
of
agreement
that
leaves
out
the
word
“effective”
can
leave
out
the
power
of
the
commission
to
determine
what
count
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
effective
doesn't
need
to
add
or
subtract
because
of
law
does
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
take
care
of
my
difficulty
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
in
the
meantime
the
commission
disposes
of
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
mean
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
whether
effective
is
there
or
not,
effective
depends
on
what
the
commission
does
or
doesn't
do
but
not
by
the
agreement
of
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
in
a
word
what
the
policy
of
congress
was
in
that
provision
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
your
time
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow
it
is
the
policy
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
context
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
gain
that
figure
yesterday
mr.
solicitor,
2%,
do
i
understand
that
to
be
the
total
gas
consumed
subject
to
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission
of
that
close
to,
whatever
it
is
only
2%
is
non-recoverable
becomes
non-
sustainable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
total
volume
of
gas
subject
to
regulation
was
consumed
and
subject
to
regulation,
only
2%
falls
under
this
non-recoverability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
all
the
--
this
2%
are
--
are
the
class
of
large
consumers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
as
your
own
statement
indicates,
they're
well
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
consumer
and
i
take
it
the
commission
wants
that
power
in
order
to
protect
the
consumer
indirectly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
had
given
you
trouble
on
that
subject?[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
difficult
problem
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
if
i
understand,
you
correct
that
this
phrase
that
i
was
about
to
ask
you
what
is
the
phrase,
as
i
understand
your
(inaudible)
this
phrase
is
found
in
contract
in
1945
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
filings
have
been
made
under
it
since
1945
before
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
all
we
have
here
now
with
the
prior
to
the
filing.
