justice

may
i
ask
this
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
original
act
had
the
exemption
or
had
exemption
for
retailers,
the
category
that
was
exempted,
the
category
or
retail
or
service
establishment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
1949
amendment
didn't
change
those
categories,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--instead
of
going
to
the
legislative
issue
of
‘49
to
tell
me
what
it
didn't
change,
would
you
mind
stating
what
the
legislative
history
was
of
the
original
act,
particularly
in
the
reports
of
the
committee
giving
the
de-limited
scope
to
retailer
service
establishment
that
you
are
giving
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
--
did
those
cases
turn
on
the
--
on
the
inclusiveness
of
these
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
other
way
around.
you
are
contending
that
those
terms
as
used
by
congress
had
to
define
this
--
define
meaning
of
which
the
corner
grocery
is
--
is
typical.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
these
--
what
are
the
classifications
by
these
senators?
where
--
you
said
in
other
aspects
of
government,
there
are
some
other
classification.
what
generalized
term
is
there
for
establishments
that
are
not
wholesale
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
assuming
you're
right,
that
was
fixed
both
by
the
administrative
construction
by
the
court
upholding
of
them,
but
as
for
the
original
act,
this
thing
--
the
amendment
isn't
changed,
the
categories
to
which
the
exemption
is
applied.
can
you
make
them
--
some
changes
with
reference
to
those
categories?
but
they
didn't
change
their
categories
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
have
to
think
the
burden
must
be
heavy
to
show,
they
meant
to
use
the
old
terms
with
new
meanings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because,
in
fact,
they
enlarged
the
exempted
areas,
enlarged
the
exempted
opportunity,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
regarding
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
for
that
enlargement
of
the
qualifications
for
exemption,
you
enlarge
the
categories
of
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
margolin,
would
you
enlighten
me
about
the
administrative
practice.
name
businesses
that
get
rulings
from
the
administrator,
as
to
whoever
they
are
or
are
not
covered
in
the
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
i
don't
mean
bulletin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
have
a
bulletin
but
made
a
john
jones
where
they
go
write
and
find
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
under
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
a
--
there
must
be
an
area
where
you
can't
tell
right
off
the
bat
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
they
were
not
changed
by
the
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
the
same
words
--
the
same
words
were
to
be
given
different
context
from
what
they
have
been
given,
leaving
out
what
--
what
was
or
was
not
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
change
made
as
to
what
--
what
enterprise
is
to
be
judged
whether
it
is
retail,
it
doubtless
made
the
changes
as
to
what
constitutes
retail
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
something
about
that.
but
if
they
make
any
change
or
if
they
manifest
any
change
in
the
starting
point,
in
the
base
question
namely,
as
to
what
enterprise
you
require
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
--
was
it
made
--
was
that
part
the
exemption?
made
any
clearer
about
the
‘49
amendment
and
it
was
by
the
city
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
could
you
tell
us
what
the
rule
--
what
ruling
you
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
ruling
did
you
get?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
way,
have
there
been
a
ruling
on
the
pawnshop,
what
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
like
a
corner
grocery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
they
been
all
ruled
on?
they've
all
been
ruled
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
anything
that
have
to
be
included
what
might
be
called
the
neighborhood?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
to
hear
they
have
some
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
have
a
wholesale
crematorium.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
give
a
consult
to
--
but
you
called
my
attention,
quite
properly,
by
saying
he's
naturally
worried
of
having
exemption
defend
on
what
witnesses
will
testify
is
regarded
by
the
investor
and
not
regarded
by
the
industry.
that
opens
up
not
a
difficult
question,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
to
put
witnesses
on
the
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
the
administrator
puts
conduit
witnesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
he
addressed
himself
to
that
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
not
thereby
imply
that
you
open
up
a
whole
new
door
as
to
what
is
a
retail
business.
i
don't
even
(inaudible)
i
--
i
don't
think
i'll
be
called
about
it
daily,
so
i
have
to
be
given
an
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
justify
the
pawnshop,
ms.
margolin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

pawnshop,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
purchased,
somebody
must
have
sold
it.
