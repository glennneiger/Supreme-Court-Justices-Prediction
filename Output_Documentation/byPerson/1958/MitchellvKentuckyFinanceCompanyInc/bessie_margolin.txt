ms.
bessie
margolin
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
the
specific
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
retail
or
service
establishment
exemption
from
both
the
minimum
wage
and
the
overtime
requirement
for
the
fair
labor
standards
act
applies
to
the
business
of
lending
money
on
credit
and
purchasing
conditional
sales
contracts,
and
taking
life
insurance
to
insure
the
borrowers,
specifically
the
business
of
making
small
loans
and
discounting
condition
of
sales
contract.
the
broader
and
underlying
issue
that's
inherent
in
this
specific
issue
here
is
whether
the
1949
amendment
to
the
original
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
was
enacted
in
1938,
whether
the
1949
amendment
so
broadened
the
scope
of
the
so-called
retail
or
service
establishment
exemption
as
to
make
every
and
any
business
within
the
general
coverage
of
the
act
eligible
to
claim
this
exemption.
the
exemption
and
question
is
quoted
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
in
section
13
(a)
(10),
and
it
provides
that
section
vi
and
vii,
which
are
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
requirements
of
the
act,
shall
not
apply
with
respect
to
any
employee
employed
by
any
retail
or
service
establishment
under
certain
conditions.
one,
being
more
than
50%
of
its
annual
dollar
volume
of
sales
is
--
of
services
is
made
within
the
state
in
which
the
establishment
is
located.
and
the
second
condition
being
that
75%
of
annual
dollar
volume
of
sales
or
services
is
not
to
resale
and
is
recognized
as
retail
sales
or
services
in
the
particular
industry.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
there's
no
issue
if
we
get
to
that.
the
government's
basic
position
is
that
this
exemption
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
the
business
of
lending
money
to
credit
companies.
and
therefore,
that
there
is
no
occasion
or
need
to
determine
whether
or
not
50
--
whether
the
percentage
requirements
are
met
so
that
--
although,
the
court
below
found
that
they
did
meet
--
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
they
did
meet
both
of
those
conditions.
the
government's
basic
position
is
that
there's
no
occasion
to
go
into
those
conditions.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
business
here,
respondent's
business
is
located
in
louisville,
kentucky
and
they
make
loans
both
in
kentucky
and
indiana
which
was
stipulated.
there's
no
question
of
their
engagement
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
a
pretrial
stipulation
that
they
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
then
they
are
in
the
production
of
goods
for
interstate
commerce,
their
employees,
sufficiently
to
be
with
the
subject
to
this
act
unless
they
came
within
this
exemption.
so
that
the
entire
evidence
was
directed
to
the
exemption
point.
the
rather
voluminous
records
is
explained
by
respondent's
endeavor
to
prove
that
their
lending
of
money
and
the
purchasing
of
this
discount
favor
thus
constitute
sales
of
services
within
the
liberal
language
of
the
exemption.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
respondent's
construction
of
this
act,
of
this
provision
stating
that
the
literal
terms
of
--
that
the
statutory
language
was
so
clear
and
unambiguous
and
so
plainly
applied
to
any
business
that
was
engaged
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
term
“engaged
in
sales
of
goods
or
in
performing
services,”
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
to
tell
--
to
determine
what
congress
meant
by
this
attention.
the
government's
position
is
that
this
exemption
does
not
encompass
every
conceivable
business
that
might
be
said
to
be
engaged
in
service.
that
it
is
limited
to
the
particular
kinds
of
businesses
that
are
traditionally
regarded
as
retail,
and
the
services
of
a
light
character,
except
that
the
establishment
of
sales,
services,
instead
of
goods.
this
was
definitely
the
interpretation
of
the
original
exemption
which
was
enacted
at
the
time
of
1938
that
the
courts
have
upheld
the
law
restricted
interpretation,
but
it
didn't.
this
exemption
was
not
intended
to
encompass
everything
that
could,
in
the
economic
sense
and
the
broadest
sense
constitute
a
service.
and
it
is
--
it
is
clear
that
before
the
1949
amendment,
this
exemption
was
given
that
limited
construction
both
by
the
administrator
and
by
the
court.
the
exemption
at
that
time,
read,
simply,
that
any
employee
engaged
in
any
retail
or
service
establishment,
the
greater
part
of
who's
selling
their
services
--
servicing
is
in
intrastate
commerce.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
spelling
out
except
in
the
general
terms
of
the
50%
rule,
but
there
was
no
spelling
out
of
the
75%
with
respect
to
retail
sales
or
sales
not
recognized
or
recognized
as
retail
in
the
industry.
congress
in
enacting
the
1949
amendment
or
--
as
--
did
as
counsel
--
as
opposing
counsel
point
out
was
dissatisfied
with
some
of
the
administrator's
interpretations
of
this
exemption.
what
counsel
does
not
recognize,
however,
is
that
the
legislative
history
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
congress
was
dissatisfied
with
only
a
very
limited
aspect
of
those
interpretations
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
so
clear
that
congress
had
no
--
we
had
felt
no
dissatisfaction
at
all
with
the
basic
interpretation
of
the
former
exemption.
that
is,
that
it
was
limited
to
certain
types
of
establishments
and
did
not
extend
to
categories
in
the
financial
field
and
the
utility
field
and
the
real
estate
or
in
the
insurance
field.
legislative
history
makes
that
so
clear,
that
we
submit,
that
it
is
controlling
and
conclusive,
and
clearly
shows
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals.
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
instant
case,
every
court
which
considered
this
issue,
and
that
includes
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
the
aetna
finance
case
and
all
three
district
courts
in
the
household
finance
and
aetna
finance
and
in
the
instant
case,
every
court
which
had
considered
this
issue
and
examined
the
legislative
history
concluded
that
the
legislative
history
was
conclusive
on
this
and
as
did
dissenting
judge
in
the
instant
case,
judge
miller
dissented
here.
for
that
reason,
in
the
limited
time
available,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
legislative
history.
as
i
stated
earlier,
there
was
no
question
that
the
administrative
interpretation
prior
to
the
1949
amendment,
was
that
this
exemption
had
no
application
to
banks,
insurance
companies,
credit
companies
including
personal
finance
companies,
newspapers,
telephone
companies
and
the
like
that
those
--
those
areas
of
industry
according
to
the
administrator
and
the
judicial
interpretations
might
save
because
the
personal
finance
company
issue
had
not
arisen,
specifically
of
that
issue,
but
the
courts
have
pretty
--
pretty
generally
upheld
the
basic
classifications
of
the
administrator.
when
the
proposal
--
proposed
amendment
came
before
congress,
the
sponsors
explicitly
asserted
the
legislative
intent
to
do
nothing
to
change,
and
i'm
quoting,
“to
do
nothing
to
change
the
previous
non-exempt
status
of
establishments”
such
as,
and
i'm
quoting,
“banks,
insurance
companies,
credit
companies,
newspapers,
telephone
companies,
gas
and
electric
utility
companies,
telegraph
companies,
et
cetera”.
now,
this
statement
was
made
in
the
reports
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
as
quoted
on
pages
25
and
26
of
the
government's
brief.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
our
point.
we
didn't
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
we
didn't
change
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
--
the
original
legislative
history
i
haven't
gone
into
here
because
this
court
had
pretty
well
expressed
what
it
was
in
the
phillips
case
and
in
the
kirschbaum
case,
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
i
think
those
cases
did
turn
on
the
certain
enroll
and
elected
it
too,
that
those
terms
did
not
--
were
not
used
in
the
broad
sense,
but
were
used
to
--
in
reference
to
the
corner
grocery
store,
the
drug
store,
the
department
store,
the
--
and
the
beauty
shop,
the
shoe
shop,
the
--
the
barber
shop,
and
service
establishments
comparable
to
your
traditional
retail
establishments.
never
once
was
anything
mentioned
about
any
credit
company
being
a
--
or
any
financial
institution
or
any
bank
being
in
that
category.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'll
say
what
this
court
said
in
the
phillips
case
was
that
the
reference
was
to
establishments
selling
merchandise
epitomized
by
the
corner
grocery,
the
drug
store
and
the
department
store.
and
in
the
--
the
roland
electric,
recognized
the
administrator's
interpretation
that
service
establishments
was
a
comparable
type.
now,
what
the
administrator
said
with
respect
to
service
establishments
was
that,
those
akin
to
typical,
these
typical
retailer
establishments,
except
that
they
sell
services
instead
of
merchandise,
such
as
restaurants,
barber
shops,
beauty
parlors,
general
homes,
shoe
repairs
shops,
et
cetera.
ms.
bessie
margolin
but
the
administrator
explicitly
said,
he
explicitly
said,
that
this
did
not
refer
in
the
financial
field
to
banks.
it
did
not
refer
to
utilities.
those
were
usually
and
ordinarily
put
in
a
different
classification
and
they
were
so
classified
in
government
standard
classifications
for
the
practical
use
for
industry.
and
that
it
was
obvious
that
congress
had
not
intended
to
include
all
of
those
in
this
one
exemption
because
it
has
specific
--
other
specific
--
one
of
the
indications
was
it
had
other
specific
exemptions.
for
example,
exempting
small
weekly
newspapers
whose
circulation
was
largely
within
the
state,
small
telephone
exchanges.
in
--
and
in
these
areas
of
the
--
the
--
congress
has
indicated
to
what
extent
in
these
other
areas
exemption
was
to
be
granted.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
is
--
there's
real
--
there's
agriculture,
there's
real
estate,
there's
financial
industries,
there's
utilities,
transportation,
they
are
several
well
recognized
areas.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
exactly
our
point.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that
--
that
is
the
contention
that
they
meant
to
use
the
old
terms
with
new
meanings
and
to
create
a
self-sufficient,
self-contained
definition
which
any
business
could
come
in
and
bring
in
experts
or
bring
in
their
own
industry
people
to
prove
that
they
regarded
their
particular
type
of
transaction
is
retail.
ms.
bessie
margolin
there's
no
question
that
congress,
in
demanding
this
exemption,
did
enlarge
it.
we
don't
deny
that.
we
think
they
enlarged
it
pretty
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
pretty
substantially.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
is
the
--
that's
--
that's
the
respondent's
case.
that
enlarging
the
qualifications
for
exemption,
congress
opened
up
the
whole
exemption
and
just
granted
a
field
day
and
open
season
to
every
--
every
and
every
--
every
employer
that
could
possibly
be
subject
to
the
act
to
come
in
and
--
and
prove
and
put
the
government
to
--
to
rebuttal.
as
this
record
indicates,
this
is
a
pretty
complicated
and
complex
and
kind
of
a
--
a
battle
of
the
experts
that's
involved
in
--
in
trying
to
determine
whether
a
particular
transaction
is
recognized
as
retail
in
--
in
a
particular
industry.
we
say
that
--
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
voluminous
legislative
history
and
the
whole
purpose
was
to
disavow
any
such
intent
to
--
to
open
this
exemption
up
to
everyone.
and
the
--
that
the
very
reason
why
the
legislative
history
is
so
voluminous
is
that
the
sponsors
were
required
to
answer
the
--
felt
required
to
answer
the
charges
and
the
criticism,
that
this
would
open
--
this
was
going
to
expand
this
exemption
far
beyond
anything
that
--
and
--
that
the
--
the
congress
would
be
willing
to
pass.
now,
in
this
connection,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
--
to
opposing
counsel's
reference
to
twice
--
two
or
three
times,
he
mentioned
that
the
administrator
himself
said
that
these
amendments
were
--
was
substituting
a
wholly,
completely
new
definitions
of
the
retail
establishments.
what
counsel
failed
to
note
is
that
the
--
that
the
administrator's
criticism
was
one
of
the
very
reasons
why
the
lengthy
debates
were
held.
that
the
--
the
debates
took
up
the
administrator's
charges
and
the
sponsors
disavowed
repeatedly
that
there
was
any
intent
to
expand
this
--
this
exemption
to
any
such
extent,
and
specifically
stated
that
they
were
adopting
the
administrator's
basic
categories.
every
reference
that
they
made
to
the
basic
categories
to
be
within
this
exemption
was
a
paraphrase
of
the
administrator's
basic
category
that
the
court
will
compare
it.
we
have
gotten
up
because
the
counsel
quotes
some
excerpts
from
the
legislative
history
too,
some
general
excerpts.
we
have
prepared
and
it
was
submitted
to
the
first
circuit
in
the
aetna
case
and
to
the
sixth
circuit
below
here.
the
substance
of
the
legislative
history
and
its
--
we
have
filed
copies
of
it
in
this
court
which
brings
together
in
one
booklet,
all
of
--
virtually
all
of
the
legislative
history
that
bears
on
this
particular
point.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
the
administrator,
in
addition
to
making
this
distinction
in
basic
category,
said
that
some
establishments,
many
in
fact,
frequently,
establishments
which
one
would
regard
as
retail
establishments
also
make
wholesales
or
nonretail
sales.
for
example
a
coal
--
coal
dealer
will
sell
in
small
amounts,
and
he'll
also
sell
in
coal,
load
lots
to
hotels
and
apartments
and
industry.
and
the
question
was
whether
a
retail
--
whether
an
establishment
that
might
look
retail
also
engaged
in
a
lot
of
this
wholesale,
this
wholesale,
a
quantity
of
sales,
sale
for
business
use,
whether
that
would
defeat
the
exemption.
the
administrator,
taking
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
frequently,
an
establishment
did
both
--
made
both
kinds
of
sale,
adopted
this
25%
tolerance
test
which
is
the
forerunner
of
the
75%
provision
in
the
amendment.
he
said
that
if
a
--
an
establishment
made
such
wholesale
or
nonretail
sales,
and
it
didn't
exceed
25%
of
its
total
annual
dollar
volume
of
business,
it
would
not
defeat
the
exemption.
and
in
connection
with
applying
that
test
to
the
categories
that
he
held
were
eligible,
he
said
that
he
would
treat
it
as
a
retail
sale,
a
nonretail
sales,
sales
for
industrial
use.
this
is
where
the
so-called
consumer
use,
“business
use”
test
came
in.
now,
the
supreme
court
adopted
that
view
that
a
retail
sale
is
something
ordinarily
for
consumer
use.
and
in
the
roland
electric
case,
the
supreme
court
approved
that
and
stated
it
in
general
terms.
now,
that
was
what
congress
was
dissatisfied
with.
they
felt
that
there
should
be
more
leeway
for
your
dealers,
your
coal
dealers,
and
your
paint
dealers
and
your
other
shops
to
be
able
to
engage
in
more
sales
for
non-consumer
use
without
losing
the
exemption.
undoubtedly,
the
sponsors
felt
that
that
type
of
establishment,
even
if
it
--
if
it
sold
--
what
--
for
business
use,
was
still
of
the
traditional
type
of
retail
establishment.
and
therefore,
they
put
in
this
provision
that
if
they
would
--
instead
of
--
of
having
the
consumer
use,
“business
use”
test
determine,
it
should
be
what
was
recognized
in
the
particular
industry.
now,
that
was
what
they
hold.
if
you
can't
read
this
legislative
history
without
seeing
that
that
was
the
thing,
they
were
primary
--
primarily
concerned
with,
if
not
solely.
and
the
sponsors
themselves
repeatedly
said
that
was
the
only
substantial
difference
between
their
proposed
amendment
and
what
the
administrator
had
been
doing.
that
was
the
only
substantial
difference.
and
as
i
say,
they
repeatedly,
explicitly
said
that
credit
companies,
banks,
public
utilities,
telephone
companies
were
not
to
be
--
were
to
remain
non-exempt.
they
recognized
they
were
non-exempt
and
so
they
were
to
remain
that
way.
and
of
--
of
--
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
approach
of
respondents,
the
construction
respondent's
take
of
this
amendment,
and
of
the
court
below,
means
not
only
that
credit
companies
or
small
loan
companies,
personal
loan
companies,
not
only
that
those
would
be
eligible
for
this
exemption,
but
they
frankly
concede
that
their
reasoning,
the
manner
in
which
they
construed
this
exemption
means
that
banks,
insurance
companies,
newspapers,
telephone
companies,
utility
companies,
telegraph
companies,
transportation
companies,
all
of
those
can
come
in
and
if
they
can
show
that
the
75%
of
their
services
to
--
is
to
consumers
or
individual
use,
or
that
--
even
if
it
isn't,
if
it's
recognized
in
that
particular
industry,
if
they
call
it
retail,
they
can
show
that
they're
entitled
to
this
exemption.
i'd
like
to
refer
from
(voice
overlap)
ms.
bessie
margolin
the?
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
--
it's
been
uniformly
--
these
--
this
type
--
these
types
of
businesses,
in
fact,
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
they
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
the
--
the
legislative
history
on
the
coverage
provisions
repeatedly
say
that
the
utilities
and
the
insurance
--
not
the
insurance
companies,
the
utilities
and
the
newspapers,
they
have
specifically
approved
all
the
decisions
holding
them
subject
to
the
act.
i
think
when
it's
realized
that
the
reasoning
of
respondents
carries
and
necessarily
imply
that
all
of
these
other
businesses
become
eligible
for
this
exemption,
there
can
be
no
question
that
congress
has
no
such
intent.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
well,
they
--
he
certainly
gives
a
lot
of
rulings
and
they
are
protected
by
them.
of
course
they
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
he
gives
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes
he
may.
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
tried
to
--
we
tried
to
advise
them
as
much
but
of
course,
the
volume
sometimes
gets
too
much
for
us
and
then
sometimes
the
delay,
but
they
certainly
--
we
certainly
do
send
out
many
such
opinions
advising
particular
companies
of
--
of
their
view
of
the
act.
i
might
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
of
course,
there's
some
--
something
that
we
--
some
that
we
can't
always
tell,
and
we
frequently
say
that
our
best
information
or
advice
on
the
present
state
of
the
law
is
such
and
such.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
five
minutes
if
i
may.
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
do
not
say
that
a
pawnshop,
as
such,
is
within
this
exemption.
we
say
that
to
the
extent
that
if
it
make
sales,
it
might
be,
but
its
lending
activities
are
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
a
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
a
bailment
more
than
a
sale.
we
say
to
the
extent
that
they
make
sales.
they
are
engaged
in
retail
sale,
but
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
such,
but
its
credit
transactions
are
--
are
retail.
now,
these
people
are
engaged
in
nothing
but
the
extension
of
credit.
they
are
dealing
with
money,
not
--
not
goods
or
services.
a
loan
is
a
loan.
it's
a
service
only
in
the
broad
generic
sense
that
mr.
henderson
and
the
other
economic
experts
testified
and
they
admittedly
testified
--
some
testified
on
the
theory
that
every
economic
endeavor
is
either
a
service
or
sale
of
goods.
every
economic
--
couldn't
think
of
anything
they
wouldn't
be
and
that's
the
whole
theory
of
the
claim
here.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
this
exemption
and
because
i
haven't
argued
it,
doesn't
mean
that
we
are
conceding
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
saying
this
language
as
clear
as
a
bail.
we
think
the
language
on
its
phase
is
in
apposite
to
the
making,
to
the
lending
of
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
stipulation
provides
they
are
engaged
in
purchasing
these
accounts
receivable.
there
is
no
sale
of
--
of
anything
there
of
goods
or
services.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
but
they
are
not
selling
and
this
applies
only
to
an
establishment
that's
engaged
in
selling
something.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
bessie
margolin
a
bank
is
classified
as
non-exempt
in
the
non-exempt
financial
category.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
--
the
original
basis
the
administrator
originally
adapted,
he
was
following
the
stand
--
primarily
the
standard
--
industrial
classification
that
the
government
had
established
for
other
purposes.
and
as
i
say,
that
was
approved
by
the
court.
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case,
one
of
the
exhibits
of
--
of
the
respondents
carried
over
from
the
household
finance
case
specifically
state
merchandising
and
--
and
financing
are
two
distinct
industries.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
mean
this
was
--
this
was
generally
recognized.
the
--
the
government's
standard
industrial
classifications
treats
finance
and
manufacturing
and
real
estate
quite
--
in
wholly
different
categories
from
the
service
trades.
ms.
bessie
margolin
a
bank
in
a
small
town
would
not
be
exempt.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
it's
just
not
--
it's
just
not
in
the
category
of
a
retail
establishment.
now,
it
may
be
that
some
of
their
--
that
if
they
don't
engage
in
interstate
activities,
many
of
their
employees
would
not
be
exempt.
this
exemption
was
--
was
originally,
as
this
court
stated,
put
in
to
take
care
of
--
to
kind
of
--to
kind
of
supplement
the
local
retailing
capacity
exemption,
in
the
jacksonville
paper
that
was
stated.
and
it
was
early
interpreted,
to
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
--
in
the
other
distinct
types
of
industries.
now,
i
did
want
them
to
make
--
take
some
time
to
make
a
response
to
this
picture
of
this
little
local
basement
office
that
counsel
has
painted.
the
stipulation
--
in
this
case,
the
interstate
activities
of
the
small
loan
business
was
not
developed
or
were
not
developed
because
of
the
stipulation
that
they
were
sufficiently
engaged
in
interstate
activity.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
stipulation
is
--
is
in
the
record
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
if
i
don't
need
to
take
the
term,
it
is
definitely
stipulated,
but
they
weren't
sufficiently
engaged
to
be
within
the
general
coverage
terms
if
they
were
not
within
this
exemption.
now,
i
take
it
that
the
court
isn't
concerned
with
this
question
related
specifically
to
this
particular
small
loan
company.
that
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
whether
the
--
this
exemption
applies
to
the
small
loan
business
generally
in
this
country,
and
that
is
one
of
the
--
the
exhibits
in
this
case.
it
says
that
a
small
loan
business
is
not
a
small
business.
that's
big
business.
it's
a
billion
and
a
dollar
a
year
annual
business
and
its
--
the
bulk
of
it
is
in
the
hands
of
20
huge
chains,
nationwide
chains,
closely
integrated.
and
i
see
my
time's
expired,
but
i
will
refer
the
court
to
the
decision
in
the
aetna
finance
case,
the
first
circuit's
decision
to
see
the
interstate
character
of
this
business
is
--
but
it's
certainly
not
purely
local.
