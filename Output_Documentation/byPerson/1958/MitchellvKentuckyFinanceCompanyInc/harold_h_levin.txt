mr.
harold
h.
levin
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court.
(inaudible)
my
knowledge.
our
position
in
brief
is
this.
congress
never
intended
to
encompass
local
activities
within
the
act.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
other
justices
of
this
and
the
former
members
of
the
court
have
warned
the
courts
not
to
absorb
by
--
by
adjudication
that
which
congress
left
to
the
state.
and
it
certainly
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
local
activity
which
can
better
be
served
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
as
mr.
justice
black
well
knows,
because
of
the
statement
he
made
in
the
--
in
the
polls
of
the
senate,
that
they
were
left
to
the
states.
and
our
claim
is
that
this
is
the
kind
of
an
activity
at
the
end
of
the
stream
of
commerce.
this
does
not
affect
interstate
commerce
which
should
be
lodged
with
the
states
in
general.
specifically,
we
would
point
out
that
--
and
if
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
expressing
an
opinion,
i
would
have
to
take
objection
to
it,
to
differ
with
him,
the
categories
were
not
established
by
the
first
--
by
the
enactment
of
the
--
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
say
they
were
certainly
changed.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
they
certainly
were
changed
and
that
it
wasn't
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
when
the
original
amendment
had
no
definition,
the
administrator
was
free
as
he
did,
to
make
interpretations
of
his
own,
and
many
of
them
were
adopted
by
this
court.
congress
was
not
only
dissatisfied
with
the
consumer
versus
the
“business
use”
test.
it
would
have
been
a
very
simple
thing
to
add
two
lines
to
the
amendment
and
say
that
this
--
that
the
fact
that
something
is
sold
to
--
for
business
use,
it
was
not
to
be
considered
necessarily
wholesale
or
--
yes,
wholesale.
they
were
concerned
greatly
with
the
broad
expansion
of
the
act
in
1949.
if,
your
honors,
will
recall,
an
amendment
was
made
of
the
definition
of
production
because
that
had
been
too
broadened.
the
beetle
amendment
had
been
virtually
killed
by
the
administrative
interpretations
of
the
amended
act.
when
they
got
around
to
talking
about
this
retail
exemption,
the
administrator,
appealing
his
oath,
so
to
speak,
had
the
lesinski
bill
introduced,
which
was
designed
to
approve
of
all
of
the
administrative
interpretations.
but
what
happened
was
that
the
congress
objected
and
the
harlan
lucas
bill
was
introduced
in
its
stead,
precisely
because
that
the
congress
found
the
interpretations
inaccurate.
they
used
such
words
out
of
thin
air,
“vacillation,”
and
one
of
the
senators
said,
if
you
--
if
you
left
it
to
--
to
the
administrator,
“you
would
exclude
everybody
from
the
exemption
and
include
everybody
under
the
act
whether
they
were
local
or
not.”
and
so,
they
adopted
a
precise
definition
and
they
said
specifically,
and
this
is
addressed
to
the
statement
about
category.
they
said,
“we're
not
going
to
have
the
same
test
in
every
situation.
we're
going
to
go
to
the
industry.
and
whatever
is
regarded
as
retail
in
the
industry
is
to
be
regarded
as
retail.
what
is
regarded
as
wholesale
is
to
be
regarded
as
wholesale.
”
and
they
said
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
right.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
i
think
so
and
of
course,
that's
a
matter
of
interpretation.
and
if
your
honor
pleases,
we
take
the
position
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
was
--
that
when
a
statute
is
clear
and
unambiguous
on
its
face
and
if
you
look
to
the
legislative
history,
and
you
get
confusing
answers,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
once
said,
we
have
a
right
to
take
a
look
at
the
statute.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
think
most
certainly.
when
the
exemption
merely
read
that
“an
establishment,
the
greater
part
of
whose
sales
or
services
is
intrastate,
shall
be
exempt”,
it
meant
nothing.
it
--
it
had
no
definition,
but
when
it
got
down
to
the
1949
amendment,
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
legislative
history
which
i'm
going
to
read
to
you,
where
not
only
did
they
say,
“we're
going
to
go
further,
we're
going
to
define
what
is
retail,”
what
is
a
retail
service
establishment,
your
honor.
those
very
words
were
used
by
the
senate
sponsor.
and
when
they
went
that
far,
then
i
say
that
one
has
no
right
to
say
that
the
categories
were
not
changed.
they
left
it
to
the
industry
to
determine
what
the
categories
are,
and
i
might
say
a
word
about
our
establishment.
it's
inaccurate
to
describe
it
as
one
selling
insurance
or
something
of
that
sort
or
merely
buying
discount
paper.
this
is
a
little
store,
ground
floor
office,
where
a
poor
working
person
comes
in
and
borrows
$5
to
$300,
the
average
is
$200.
they
make
an
application
and
a
telephone
call
is
made
to
check
on
the
employment
record
and
they
are
given
this
money.
at
high
interest
rates,
i'll
agree.
but
much
lower
than
the
--
than
the
earlier,
before
the
uniform
small
no
longer
established,
the
--
the
sharks
got
after
them
and
got
much
higher
rates
of
interest.
these
are
regulated
by
the
state.
that's
one
aspect
of
the
business.
testimony
is
clear
and
undisputed
that
the
purposes
for
which
these
loans
were
made
were
for
household
goods,
for
school
expenses,
for
clothing,
furniture.
nothing
could
be
more
local
in
the
sense
that
this
court
or
rather
retail
in
the
sense
that
this
court
described
it
when
it
talked
about
consumptive
purposes
rather
than
business
purposes.
and
by
the
way,
we
claim
we
come
under
the
amendment
regardless
--
we
--
we
come
under
the
--
the
exemption
regardless
of
whether
we
are
talking
about
the
old
or
the
new
law.
the
courts
never
tested
the
ruling
of
the
administrator
on
this
question.
and
so,
we
come
to
the
discount
operation.
now,
what
happens
there?
a
person
goes
in
to
buy
a
radio
or
a
television
set
and
hasn't
the
money.
a
telephone
call
is
made
to
this
office
and
they
check
the
credit
of
the
individual
and
if
the
credit
is
good,
the
credit
is
advanced
and
allowed.
we
take
the
paper
and
we
take
the
--
collect
the
money
on
the
debt.
so
that
as
the
court
below
found,
also
these
establishments
are
a
single
unit
engaged
in
lending
money
to
individuals,
not
the
businesses
for
consumptive
purposes.
there's
no
re-lending,
no
element
of
resale.
now,
that
brings
us
to
this
question
of
recognition
in
the
industry,
and
if
the
statute
is
to
be
interpreted
in
its
plain
meaning
and
--
and
language,
the
question
arises
whether
the
industries,
the
financial
industry
recognizes
this
establishment
as
a
retail
establishment.
well,
we
have
testimony
from
elmer
(inaudible)
trust
company
of
the
first
national
bank
of
chicago,
mr.
(inaudible)
trust
company
of
new
york
and
leon
henderson,
they
all
agreed
that
there
is
a
very
definite
distinction
in
the
financial
industry
between
wholesale
and
retail.
and
that
these
small
loan
offices
are
regarded
as
a
retail
into
the
industry.
that
to
tonight
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
no.
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
have
come
to
that
right
now,
this
business
is
about
credit
companies.
is
that
what
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
there
was
nothing
said
about
any
particular
industry.
the
only
thing
that
was
said,
and
i
agree
with
my
adversary,
that
mention
was
made
of
a
number
of
the
categories
which
she
referred
to.
well,
i
call
this
to
your
honor's
attention
that
at
the
end
of
the
list
of
establishments
which
they
mention
specifically,
the
senate
sponsor
said,
and
he
talked
about
taxicab
company,
(inaudible)
service
companies
and
then
he
--
and
hotels
and
so
forth,
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
and
other
establishments
performing
local
services.
that's
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
the
--
the
first
national
bank
of
chicago,
whose
vice-president
testified
in
the
household
case
and
the
testimony
came
over
to
this
case,
lends
millions
of
dollars
to
the
household
finance
company,
which
in
turn
lends
it
to
the
individual.
in
a
recent
article
in
the
life
magazine,
they'd
talked
about
the
merger
of
morgan
&
company
with
chase
--
no
not
chase,
first
national
bank
--
in
any
event,
whatever
company
is
it's
--
whatever
bank,
is
it
chase?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
quote
it
in
my
brief
because
i
thought
it'd
be
interesting
to
know
that
even
in
the
--
even
the
general
public
talks
about
wholesale
and
retail
in
the
financial
industry.
they
say
that
both
of
these
companies,
both
of
these
banks
are
wholesalers
of
credit
as
distinguished
from
those
who
lend
money
to
individuals
for
consumptive
purposes.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well
except
that
--.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
it's
a
close
one
but
the
building
and
loan
association
is
one
which
lends
money
for
building
purposes,
which
is
something
much
more
substantial
than
lending
money
for
the
buying
of
radio
or
television
or
to
pay
school
expenses.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
that's
a
very
important
element.
in
fact,
my
learned
adversary
would
agree
with
me
that
size
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
them.
in
fact,
one
of
the
things
that
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
the
size
of
the
loans,
yes,
yes.
the
size
of
the
--
the
amount
of
coal
that
sell
determines
in
the
coal
industry
whether
its
wholesale
or
retail
and
the
size
--
size
of
the
loan
would
definitely
determine
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
yes,
i
think
it
would
be.
i
think
it
would
be
because
it's
not
a
small
loan.
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
loan
that
--
that
it
takes
care
of
consumptive
purposes,
things
that
people
--
people
use
up
immediately.
now
--
now
then,
to
the
legislative
history.
the
--
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
black,
when
he
served
as
chairman
of
the
labor
committee
of
the
senate
in
connection
with
the
original
act
stated,
and
he
is
quoted
by
congressman
lucas
as
an
introduction
to
this
act,
the
bill
carefully
excludes
from
its
scope
--
no,
that
wasn't
it.
the
--
the
bill
was
not
intended
to
and
it
did
not
attempt
to
fix
minimum
wages
and
maximum
hours
in
the
very
peculiarly
local
business
units
of
the
nation.
and
then,
mr.
justice
black
stated,
"businesses
of
a
purely
local
type,
which
serve
a
particular
local
community,
and
which
do
not
send
their
products
into
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce
can
better
be
regulated
by
the
laws
of
the
communities
and
of
the
states
in
which
the
business
units
operate.
that's
as
to
the
original
act.
now,
with
respect
to
the
1949
amendment,
congressman
lucas
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
the
1938
act,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
the
one
that
you
spoke
of?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
do
you
mean
at
the
original
act?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
then
i
--
i
will
give
the
senate
report
on
the
bill
which
states,
“the
bill
carefully
excludes
from
its
scope
business
in
the
several
states
that
is
of
a
purely
local
nature.
it
leaves
to
local
state
and
local
community
their
own
responsibilities
concerning
those
local
service
and
other
business
trades
that
do
not
substantially
influence
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce,
and
this
establishment
certainly
doesn't
influence
the
--
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
this
language.
well
this
is
a
senate
--
this
is
a
senate
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
your
honor,
i
am
quite
sure
this
is
a
senate
report
on
the
final
bill
because
it
is
quoted
in
one
of
this
court's
cases
and
that's
where
i
got
it
from.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
and
it
ends
with
a
statement
for
example,
the
policy
in
this
regard
is
such
that
it
is
not
even
intended
to
include
in
its
scope
those
purely
local
establishments
located
near
state
lines
and
therefore,
the
--
the
retail
exception.
now,
senator
holland
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
was
even
thought
of,
but
i
think
i
said
i
was
going
to
take
up
that
credit
company
business
which
seems
to
be
bothering
some
of
your
honors.
we
had
a
ruling,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
a
ruling
was
asked
by
the
personal
loan
companies
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
covered
by
the
act
and
whether
or
not
they
fitted
in
to
the
retail
exemption.
and
the
ruling
encompassed
banks,
insurance
companies,
building
and
loan
associations,
and
personal
loan
companies,
all
grouped
in
that
order.
now,
the
strange
thing
happened
when
the
question
was
put,
obviously,
on
half
of
the
administrator
in
the
courts
of
the
debates
as
to
whether
or
not
this
category
was
to
be
exempt
or
not
under
the
amendment.
and
curiously,
there
were
credit
companies
which
substituted
for
personal
loan
companies,
which
indicates
the
danger
of
giving
too
much
reliance
on
legislative
debates,
because
credit
companies,
if
we
read
the
dictionary,
refers
you
to
the
commercial
credit
companies.
as
we
all
know,
they're
obviously
wholesalers.
credit
companies
were
thrown
in
with
banks
and
insurance
companies,
also
obviously
wholesalers.
now,
my
adversary,
in
her
fine
brief,
says
–
well,
a
small
loan
company
is
a
credit
company.
our
answer
is,
so
is
a
pawn
shop,
so
as
a
credit
retail
store,
or
a
furniture
store
which
sells
goods
on
credit.
but
certainly,
they
were
encompassed
by
this
credit
company
classification.
if
the
administrator
wanted
a
definite
opinion,
whether
we
agree
or
not
that
legislative
history
should
be
planted
so
that
it
can
be
used
at
the
time
of
the
harvest,
makes
no
difference.
but
i
have
no
objection
to
the
--
to
the
legislative
history
being
injected
with
the
question
of
that
kind.
but
why
it
wasn't
made
clear
that
they
were
talking
about
personal
loan
companies?
exactly
the
same
language
is
used
as
in
the
ruling
except
for
this
substitution
of
credit
companies
for
personal
loan
company.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
what
would
what?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
got
a
ruling
that
it
was
not
---
they
were
not
in
the
exempt
list
but
the
administrator
never
dared
to
go
to
court
to
test
it.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
oh,
the
pawnshops
are
clearly
on
the
administrative
exempt
list,
also
a
retail.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
oh
well,
i
don't
know
what
he
calls
it,
a
corner
grocery.
he
doesn't
restrict
his
--
his
exempt
list
to
corner
groceries
by
a
long
shot,
unless
your
honor,
thinks,
that
a
crematorium
and
a
dance
hall,
and
a
hotel
is
also
a
--
are
also
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
all
have
been
ruled
on,
yes.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
they
are
all
considered
exempt
retail
establishment.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
no,
i
think
that
everything
that
could
--
that
would
exclude
any
concept
of
wholesale.
you
can't
have
a
wholesale
crematorium
and
you
can't
have
a
wholesale
loan
to
an
individual
to
buy
his
good.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
know.
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
too,
your
honor,
and
i
share
your
view
on
it.
now,
the
senator
holland
was
asked
whether
this
amendment
would
add
to
the
number
of
the
exempt
people
and
his
answer
was
no.
insofar
as
concerns,
those
who
are
exempted
under
the
proper
meaning
of
the
original
act,
the
answer
will
be
yes,
as
to
an
undetermined
number
which
are
included
in
the
field
that
has
been
included
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
act
by
interpretive
ruling.
now,
the
word
“traditional”
was
used
here
that
the
--
the
establishment
must
be
retail
in
the
traditional
sense,
but
this
is
what
the
house
sponsor
said
about
--
about
traditional.
he
used
the
word
“traditional”.
he
says,
"my
amendment
clears
that
up
by
exempting
the
establishments
which
are
traditionally
regarded
as
retail.
it
is
only
in
that
sense
that
it
clarifies
such
doubt
that
my
amendment
can
be
regarded
as
expanding
the
present
exemption,
but
in
real
sense,
it
is
not
expanding
the
exemption
but
simply
confirming
it,
for
those
establishments
which
congress
always
intended
to
exempt”
and
this
was
said
in
the
spirit
of
criticism.
“the
contrary
view
must
assume”
and
this
is
important
on
the
word
“traditional,”
“that
in
granting
the
retail
and
service
establishment
exemption,
congress
intended
to
reject
what
is
traditionally
recognized
as
a
retail
or
service,
as
a
retail
sale
or
service,
in
an
industry
and
to
adapt
an
arbitrary
concept
of
what
is
retailing
or
servicing.”
then
later,
the
--
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harold
h.
levin
this
is
the
house
sponsor
as
i
recall
it
or
is
it
the
senate
sponsor,
one
of
the
two.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
service
--
service
--
retail
service
establishment,
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
--
read
two
together
in
a
sense.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
they
say
retail
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
yes,
they
say
retail
or
service.
i'll
accept,
your
honor's
correction,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
consider
them
also
a
retail
in
the
--
in
the
sense
that
we've
been
talking
about
it.
now,
the
senate
--
senator
taft
said,
in
those
power
of
lucas
said,
that
the
amendment
was
to
have
the
effect
of
confirming
the
exemption
for
the
various
local
neighborhood
businesses,
to
call
it
was
the
original
purpose
of
the
existing
law
to
exempt.
and
on
the
subject
of
definition,
as
senator
holland
said,
and
this
has
to
do
with
the
question
of
categories.
senator
holland
said,
“it
is
our
desire
to
clarify
entirely
the
status
of
retail
and
service
establishments
by
defining
them,
defining
establishments
and
letting
them
know,
beyond
per
venture,
of
doubt
whether
and
when
they
are
in
fact,
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
the
law.
it
is
of
you,
the
sponsors
of
the
amendment,
that
is,
the
duty
of
the
congress
at
this
time
while
the
act
is
being
amended,”
and
they
weren't
just
talking
about
consumer
test.
“to
clarify
the
meaning
of
the
terms
‘retail
establishment'
and
‘service
establishment.”
i
think
your
father
is
--
is
right
above
that,
and
service
establishment
so
that
every
person
affected
thereby,
both
employers
and
employees,
including,
of
course,
the
administrator
and
the
staff,
will
know
who
is
intended
to
be
covered
and
who
is
not.
and
then,
as
my
friend
said,
the
--
the
administrator
objected
to
the
act,
precisely
because
it
would
supply
a
definition.
and
this
is
what
he
wrote
to
the
--
to
one
of
the
senators
and
it
was
read
in
the
senate.
he
said,
“the
bill
would
substitute
a
completely
new
set
of
definition.”
and
i'd
like
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
hear
this
because
he
talked
about
categories,
you'll
excuse
me
for
suggesting
it.
“the
bill
would
substitute
a
completely
a
new
set
of
definition”,
said
the
administrator,
“of
a
retail
or
service
establishment
in
place
of
the
clear
definition
now
recognized
by
the
courts.
years
of
litigations,”
he
said.
“he
would
be
required
to
determine
how
the
exemption
should
be
applied.
the
amendment
would
give
rise
to
exceedingly
difficult
problems
in
administration
since
it
is
by
no
means
clear
what
different
industries
regard
as
retail
sale.”
so,
that
i
think
there
was
an
intention
to
provide
a
binding
and
controlling
definition
and
if
there's
any
--
if
you
aren't
convinced
of
that,
i
have
one
more,
says
that
here.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
he
--
he
was
including
both.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
i
don't
know
whether
i
cut
it
off
before
the
end
of
it,
but
--
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
he
was
talking
about
retail
sales
or
services.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
--
but
that
objection
is
not
new.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
it
was
raised
in
the
senate.
it
was
raised
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
he
addressed
him
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
all
right.
now,
let's
take
--
take
the
next
one.
senator
holland
said
that
under
the
third
test
any
sale
or
service,
absolute
resale
will
have
to
be
treated
by
the
administrator
and
the
courts
as
a
retail
sale
or
service,
so
long
as
such
sale
or
service
is
recognized
in
the
particular
industry
as
a
retail
sale
or
service.
and
he
went
on
further
and
said,
“the
administrator
and
the
courts,
as
well
as
the
people
who
are
in
business,
are
warned
that
the
rules
prevailing
in
the
business,
the
understanding
of
the
terms
in
the
business,
would
apply
with
the
complete
knowledge
that
the
same
would
not
apply
in
every
industry.”
mr.
harold
h.
levin
well,
perhaps
--
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
prepared
on
that,
your
honor,
but
well,
i
am
not
here
representing
a
building
and
loan
association
or
a
small
or
--
nor
do
i
know
how
they
operate.
i
know
some
of
them
operate
in
very
fancy
buildings
and
like
banks
and
lend
very
substantial
sums.
mr.
harold
h.
levin
there
are
big
credit
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
there
are,
there
are
but
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
levin
that's
correct,
but
you're
talking
in
terms
of
what
the
employer
is
or
does.
i
agree
with
your
honor
100%,
but
if
you're
talking
about
--
and
this
doesn't
happen
to
be
one
of
those.
but
if
you're
talking
about
what
happens
and
what
the
employees
do,
and
we
certainly
have
been
warned
sufficiently
by
this
court.
that
is
what
the
employees
do
that
counts
and
not
what
the
employer
does,
then
i
think
the
question
is,
are
these
employees
engaged
in
a
local
activity
or
aren't
they?
are
they
engaged
in
an
activity
where
they
are
dealing
at
the
end
of
the
stream
of
commerce
to
“the
administrator”
or
are
they
not?
and
i
--
i
assert
that
the
congress,
in
adapting
this
amendment,
definitely
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
leave
it
to
the
industries,
that
is
not
leave
it
to
the
industries,
but
permit
the
industries
to
say
what
is
their
custom
and
practice
and
then
have
the
courts
or
the
administrator,
and
the
administrator
determine
what
is
correct.
now,
the
fear
that
this
would
open
the
--
the
door
to
a
tremendous
number
of
--
of
cases
is
not
--
has
not
been
realized.
this
is
the
first
case
on
the
subject,
in
this
court,
and
the
only
--
there
are
only
two
or
three
cases
besides
the
small
loan
cases
that
--
that
i
have
come
across
in
all
of
the
circuits.
i
want
to
call,
your
honors'
attention,
if
my
time
is
not
up.
i
think
i
have
five
minutes.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
--
to
this
aspect,
the
one
referred
to
by
the
chief
justice.
one
of
the
objections
to
the
amendment
in
congress
was
that
it
would
leave
it
to
the
industry,
and
that
therefore,
it
wasn't
a
good
idea.
this
industry
recognition
test
was
therefore
called
a
joker.
but
the
answer
given
by
the
sponsors
was
and
i
quote,
“under
the
amendment,
the
courts
would
decide
the
question
of
what
sales
or
services
are
recognized
as
retail
in
a
particular
industry.”
now,
that
decision
has
been
made
by
three
--
every
court
that's
heard
it.
each
of
the
three
lower
courts
have
agreed
that
this
business
is
recognized
as
retail
in
the
financial
industry.
they
have
the
qualifications
where
we
lost,
based
on
the
claim
that
you
cannot
apply
the
retail
exemption
to
personal
loan
company.
now,
senator
holland
said,
“how
better
could
the
matter
be
left
than
by
recognizing
the
dividing
line
between
retail
sales
and
wholesale
sales
in
a
particular
industry
of
the
thousands
of
industries
which
will
be
affected
by
the
law.”
and
senator
taft
said,
hardly,
and
this
is
the
answer
given
in
the
house
of
congress,
“hardly,
an
industry
can
be
found
in
which
the
question
of
what
is
retail
and
what
is
wholesale
had
not
been
settled
for
years.
it
is
a
question
of
fact,
just
as
much
as
any
other
question
of
fact.
it
is
a
question
of
fact
which
we
are
perfectly
able
to
determine.”
now,
with
those
pronouncements,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
said
that
an
establishment,
which
is
recognized
as
retail,
as
a
retail
service
establishment
in
an
industry,
can't
qualify
unless
it
meets
some
preconceived
idea
of
what
is
a
retail
service
establishment,
whether
that
preconceived
idea
comes
from
the
administrator
or
anybody
else.
and
i
might
say
this
to,
your
honors'.
i
know
that
you
have
held
and
we
are
reminded
that
the
--
great
weight
must
be
given
to
the
administrator,
but
the
administrator
in
--
for
a
long
time
has
served
as
an
advocate
to
expand
this
very
good
act
and
to
limit
exemptions
under
it.
and
when
he's
defeated
in
congress,
he
turns
to
the
court.
in
fact
judge
magruder
had
occasion
to
--
to
comment
on
that
in
connection
with
the
(inaudible)
amendment
where
he
said
that
the
administrator
would
have
us
decide
this
--
this
case
as
though
the
amendment
had
not
been
adapted,
and
that's
what
the
administrator
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
