doesn't
it
(inaudible)
if
--
if
this
becomes
part
of
the
statute
or
federal
law,
isn't
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
if
this
man
hadn't
died
and
this
had
been
an
action
for
injury
short
of
death,
there
would
no
doubt
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
federal
maritime
rule
contributory
negligence
was
applied.
a
lot
of
these
deaths
if
the
mere
not
the
mere
rather
important,
incidents
of
death
is
the
thing
that
distinguishes
this.
we
do
apply
the
rules
of
contributory
negligence
of
the
48
states
an
area
where
we
are
looking
for
uniformity
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
the
very
point
mr.
mahoney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
the
very
point?
what
are
you
enforcing
here?
are
you
enforcing
a
state
claim
or
a
federal
claim
in
the
proceeding
of
this
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i've
heard
you
say
that
before
but
what
law
is
being
enforced,
state
or
federal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
about
the
next
case,
the
tungus
case?
is
that
a
state
claim
i
think
also?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
but
it's
an
admiral
unit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
admiral
decides.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
tungus?
they're
next
too.
it's
brought
on
the
admiralty
side,
wasn't
it,
and
required
diversities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
have
been,
but
in
skovgaard
it
was
in
admiralty,
wasn't
it?
it
was
specifically
admiralty
remedy
that
was
certainly
enforced.
there
was
a
trial
before
a
district
judge
without
a
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
but
you
certainly
have
to
meet
i
suggest
more
directly
than
you
have
whether
actually
this
is
a
state
remedy
that's
being
enforced
or
a
federal
remedy
that's
being
enforced,
even
though
it
depends
upon
--
on
the
source
for
which
the
--
upon
which
the
claim
is
based
is
a
state
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
his
work
connected
though
of
--
with
furthering
the
use
of
the
vessel
or
its
operation
is
a
going
instrument
of
navigation
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
was
the
propulsion
machinery,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
twill
did
i
--
this
issue
go
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
issue
went
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
this
particular
part
of
element.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
with
this
as
an
element
of
that
concept?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
baker,
you
don't
mean
there
aren't
cases
in
this
court
on
this
question?
what
about
desper
and
seneca
and
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
all
the
rest
of
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
quite
a
problem
of
whether
in
navigation
or
not
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
aren't
they
relevant
to
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not
be,
but
the
problem
whether
this
was
in
navigation
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
on
the
facts
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
baker,
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
exhibit
in
which
you
--
in
which
you
referred
us
a
few
minutes
ago
and
which
is
quoted
on
page
2
of
your
brief,
isn't
that
rather
inconsistent
with
your
position
that
says
the
crew
is
to
do
is
to
remove
and
replace
the
eight
cylinder
heads
and
so
on,
but
that
the
contractor
is
to
do
this
work
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
doesn't
that
create
a
very
dichotomy
anyway
against
what
you're
arguing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
and
that
it
is
so
much.
but
then
the
contractor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
whom
sieracki
was
employed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
by
a
subcontractor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
say
it's
not
a
fair
inference
that
they
employed
this
contract
to
do
this
kind
of
work,
because
there
wasn't
anyone
qualified
to
do
it
just
the
way
that
he
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
makes
your
argument
any
weaker,
but
that's
the
fact,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
this
subcontractor
a
specialist
in
doing
this
kind
of
cleaning
with
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
fair
entrance
to
be
made
from
this
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
didn't
go
specific
to
the
jury
as
a
specially
submitted
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
baker,
let
me
say
if
this
doesn't
come
down
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question,
are
you
in
effect
suggesting
this
all
that
you're
looking
to
the
state
laws
for
is
to
determine
whether
it
provides
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
and
if
it
does
under
wrongful
death
is
a
death
actionable
in
any
event
to
which
the
maritime
--
general
maritime
law
might
apply.
the
shape
of
the
remedy
depends
upon
federal
law
and
not
upon
state
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
all
you
look
to
the
state
statute
for
is
the
naked
fact
does
the
state
or
does
it
not
provide
an
action
for
wrongful
death
and
ignore
everything
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
it's
clear,
isn't
it,
that
in
an
ordinary
united
jersey
lawyers,
i
think,
can
agree
upon
this?
in
the
ordinary
automobile
death
action,
in
the
--
under
new
jersey
statute,
there's
no
rule
of
comparative
negligence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
contributory
negligence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
barred
all
recovery
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
charge
which
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
in
this
case
that
it
was
comparative
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
negligence
and
not
negligence
as
a
bar.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
certainly
contrary
to
new
jersey
lawyers.
