mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
four
separate
grounds
of
appeal
here
and
so
i
will
give
you
the
facts
as
briefly
as
possible
in
order
to
have
enough
time
to
touch
on
each.
now,
this
action
was
started
by
the
administratrix
of
the
decedent
walter
halecki
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
alleging
diversity
of
citizenship
and
was
based
entirely
upon
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
new
jersey.
the
complaint
alleged
in
substance
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
which
was
the
pilot
association
that
owned
a
boat
called
the
pilot
boat
new
jersey
and
also
alleged
unseaworthiness
of
that
pilot
boat.
now,
the
facts
briefly
were
these.
in
september
of
1951,
this
pilot
boat
was
turned
over
to
a
repair
yard
in
new
jersey
called
rodermond
repair
yard.
the
boat
was
there
for
a
period
of
several
weeks
undergoing
annual
overhauling
and
repairs.
the
nature
of
the
repairs
was
varied.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
crews
stayed
on
the
boat,
some
of
them
took
part
in
some
of
the
less
substantial
repairs
such
as
painting
and
shipping.
the
boat
was
tied
up
with
a
pier.
there's
no
question
it
was
in
navigable
waters.
however,
the
boat
was,
during
its
period
in
the
repair
yard,
a
dead
ship,
that
is,
there
was
no
power
aboard.
any
power
that
was
used
or
equipment
and
repair
came
from
rodermond
repair
yard.
now,
some
of
the
work
could
be
done
included
electrical
repairs
and
rodermond
wasn't
equipped
to
perform
those
repairs
so
they
subcontracted
the
electrical
work
to
a
company
called
k.
&
s.
electrical
company,
also
a
jersey
corporation
and
the
employer
of
the
decedent.
neither
rodermond
nor
k.
&
s.
were
parties
to
this
action.
the
decedent
was
a
shore-side
electrician.
most
of
his
work
was
done
at
shore
and
pursuant
to
orders
received
from
his
employer
k.
&
s.,
he
and
a
fellow
worker
by
the
name
of
doidge,
also
an
electrician,
came
aboard
the
pilot
boat
on
the
day
before
they
were
to
do
the
work
in
question.
the
particular
item
of
work
that
we
are
interested
in
today
was
cleaning
the
generators
on
the
pilot
boat.
necessarily
the
power
had
to
be
ought
to
do
that
work
because
the
generators
supply
the
power
of
the
boat.
the
way
the
work
was
to
be
done
was
to
spray
these
generators
with
a
solvent
called
carbon
tetrachloride
to
dissolve
the
grease
on
the
generator.
the
record
discloses
that
this
was
the
customary
method
when
the
--
the
decedent
and
its
co-worker
doidge
had
customarily
used
and
had
done
many
times.
now,
carbon
tetrachloride
was
admittedly
a
dangerous
substance.
it
was
known
to
be
such
by
the
decedent
and
its
co-worker,
dangerous
that
is
if
inhaled
to
a
substantial
amount.
therefore,
the
ventilation
system
of
the
boat
itself
which
consisted
in
the
usual
vents
and
blowers
which
were
designed
to
take
the
fumes
out
of
the
engine
room
were
supplemented
or
automated
by
various
pieces
of
portable
equipment,
none
of
which
belonged
to
the
boat.
they
all
either
were
property
of
the
repair
yard
or
a
property
of
k.
&
s.
electrical
company.
very
briefly,
the
day
before
the
decedent
halecki
and
doidge
came
in
and
assemble
this
equipment.
they
put
blowers
and
air
hoses
and
portable
fans,
various
devices
to
supplement
the
ship's
equipment
which
was
manifestly
not
designed
to
take
out
carbon
tetrachloride
which
was
heavier
than
air
substance.
briefly
stated
on,
saturday
it
was,
they
came
aboard
expressly
then
because
no
crewmen
were
around,
no
repair
yard
workers
were
present.
it
was
admittedly
dangerous
work.
the
only
person
present
in
addition
to
the
two
electricians
halecki
and
doidge
was
a
watchman
employed
by
the
defendant
and
he
admittedly
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
work,
he
didn't
take
part
in
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
told
him
to
leave
because
it
was
dangerous.
one
of
the
pieces
of
equipment
which
they
used
were
gas
masks
which
belonged
to
k.
&
s.
electrical
company.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
this
work
was
entirely
done
in
the
discretion
of
the
two
electricians,
the
manner
in
which
they
did
it
was
up
to
themselves,
the
time
of
which
was
up
to
themselves,
there
was
no
supervision,
no
orders
from
anyone
else.
the
work
proceeded
for
several
hours
without
a
vent,
a
boatman
took
part
in
it.
however,
doidge,
because
he
had
a
sore
arm,
didn't
do
very
much
with
the
spraying,
halecki
himself
did
most
of
it.
very
briefly,
it
consisted
of
spraying
this
carbon
tetrachloride,
a
liquid,
out-of-tank
by
means
of
an
air
hose
and
it
will
blows
around
to
blow
the
fumes
away.
at
the
completion
of
the
work
mr.
doidge
said
that
--
mr.
halecki
said
that
he
didn't
feel
very
well.
a
few
days
later
he
took
sick,
he
was
hospitalized,
two
weeks
later
he
died.
the
hospital
record
which
was
put
into
evidence
by
the
plaintiff
disclosed
that
the
cause
of
his
death
was
carbon
tetrachloride
poisoning
and
that
fact
is
not
in
dispute.
however,
the
record
also
disclosed
that
the
decedent
had
consumed
for
a
period
of
five
months
prior
to
his
death
a
half
a
pint
of
whiskey
a
day.
the
significance
of
that
fact
i
will
mention
in
a
few
moments.
the
main
factual
issue
with
the
trial
was
this.
the
plaintiff
contended
that
the
cause
of
the
death
was
inadequate
ventilation
system
on
the
pilot
boat
new
jersey.
they
said
there
was
a
dangerous
condition
there,
that
the
decedent
was
exposed
to
an
improper
or
dangerous
concentration
of
carbon
tetrachloride.
the
defendant,
on
the
other
hand,
introduced
the
testimony
of
dr.
milton
helpern,
a
new
york
state
medical
examiner
and
a
leading
toxicologist,
who
testified
that
a
person
who
consumed
a
large
amount
of
alcohol
was
susceptible
to
a
very
small
exposure,
an
exposure
far
less
than
the
usual
permissive
percentage.
so
small
perhaps
he
cited
an
incident
where
a
person
using
carbon
at
a
household
preparation
could
be
severely
injured
if
he
had
alcohol
in
his
system.
at
any
rate,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
sum
of
$65,000.
the
verdict
was
upheld
by
the
circuit
court.
now,
there
are
four
grounds
for
this
appeal.
first
that
the
decedent's
--
that
the
plaintiff's
action
pursuant
to
the
wrongful
death
act
of
new
jersey,
the
sought
of
her
right,
should
be
determined
by
the
state
rule
contributory
negligence
and
not
by
the
maritime
rule
of
comparative
negligence.
the
second
ground,
it
was
contended
by
the
defendant
that
in
any
event,
the
wrongful
death
act
of
new
jersey
applied
only
to
negligence
and
was
not
broad
enough
to
encompass
unseaworthy.
thirdly,
the
defendant
contended
quite
apart
from
the
previous
ground
that
the
decedent,
by
the
nature
of
his
employment,
was
not
entitled
to
an
unseaworthy
vessel.
he
wasn't
one
of
the
persons
to
whom
the
warranty
extended.
and
finally,
the
defendant
contended
that
there
was
insufficiency
that
it
had
never
been
proved
that
a
dangerous
condition
existed
aboard
the
vessel.
now,
addressing
myself
first
to
the
question
of
contributory
negligence.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
--
the
new
jersey
wrongful
death
action
was
the
basis
of
this
suit.
in
fact,
it's
the
only
basis,
your
honor.
the
new
jersey
wrongful
death
act.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
yes,
there's
no
question
of
that
i
believe.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
exactly
your
honor.
and
i
might
state
just
an
anticipation,
the
new
jersey
rule
is
contributory
negligence.
now,
the
trial
judge
charged
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
exactly.
that's
my
premise.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
the
trial
judge
charged
comparative
negligence
over
the
objections
of
the
defendant
and
its
question
was
more
than
academic
because
the
decedent
assembled
the
equipment.
now
the
first
point
is
that
there's
no
question
i
think,
it's
not
disputed
that
the
general
maritime
law
had
no
remedy
for
wrongful
death.
and
therefore,
claimants
in
a
situation
like
halecki
found
himself
are
required
to
look
to
the
state
statute
and
the
honorary
courts
had
approved
such
a
procedure.
they
will
permit
the
state
statute
to
be
--
to
be
used
to
supplement
that
gap
in
the
maritime
law.
this
plaintiff
suit
under
the
wrongful
death
act
of
new
jersey
which
gave
her
a
right
that
she
didn't
have
under
the
maritime
law.
the
issue
then
is
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicated
should
these
rights
derived
from
the
state
be
determined
by
state
rules
of
contributory
negligence
or
by
maritime
rules.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
i
say
supplement
for
this
region
that
the
maritime
law
has
no
provision
for
wrongful
death.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
it
does
--
it
does
adopt
himself.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
perhaps
it
does
your
honor.
however,
this
court
has
ruled
that
when
it
is
adopted,
it
must
be
adopted
together
with
its
limitation.
now,
we
have
cited
decisions
only
of
this
court
on
that
point
and
they
have
universally
held
the
cases
which
we
cite,
the
harrisburg,
western
fuel
against
garcia,
levinson
against
deupree
all
decisions
of
this
court
have
said
that
where
the
actually
court
take
the
state
rule
and
adopt
them,
they
must
take
them
together
with
their
limitations.
for
example,
where
the
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
exactly,
your
honor.
the
--
the
harrisburg
case
and
western
fuel
said
that
with
the
wrongful
death
act
was
used
in
the
state
they
had
to
use
the
state
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
this
specific
issue
has
not
been
before
this
court
to
my
knowledge.
however,
in
a
case
called
garrett
against
moore-mccormack,
mr.
justice
black
wrote
an
opinion
which
seems
to
answer
the
question
well
not
specific
terms
as
to
the
comparative
negligence
rule,
it
stated
in
his
opinion
very
clearly
that
the
right
rooted
in
either
jurisdiction
either
in
maritime
or
a
state
must
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
substantive
law
of
the
jurisdiction
of
their
origin
and
that's
our
major
premise.
there's
no
question
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out,
his
language
is
quoted
in
our
brief
on
page
26,
that
this
works
in
both
directions
not
only
as
maritime
law
to
be
protected
as
in
the
garrett
case
and
garrett
attempt
was
made
to
limit
the
claimants
rights
to
a
state
rule
and
he
was
a
living
claimant
and
the
court
said
no,
that
his
maritime
right
must
be
protected
and
they
cannot
be
limited
by
state
law.
however,
if
i
may
read
very
briefly
from
this
opinion.
the
constant
objective
of
legislation
and
jurisprudence
is
to
assure
litigants
full
protection
for
all
substantive
rights
intended
to
be
afforded
them
by
the
jurisdiction
by
which
the
right
itself
originate.
mr.
justice
black
then
referred
to
the
erie
railroad
against
tompkins
case.
and
the
final
sentence
in
the
excerpt
which
we
quote
and
i
think
this
is
extremely
germane
to
our
issue,
admiralty
court
when
invoked
to
protect
rights
rooted
in
state
law
endeavor
to
determining
issues
in
accordance
with
the
substantive
law
of
the
state.”
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
oh,
i
think
clearly,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
if
i
may
distinguish
between
the
words
rights
and
remedies
here
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
specific
point
a
little
later
in
the
argument
the
right
sue
at
all
to
the
defendant
of
the
decedent
comes
in
the
state
law.
the
remedies
maybe
something
quite
different
i
just
--
we
distinguish
somewhat
later
in
our
argument
between
survival
statutes
for
example
and
wrongful
death
act.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
that's
correct
sir.
now,
i
won't
quote
the
circuit
court's
opinions
on
this
but
both
before
the
halecki
decision
and
after
it
in
the
third
circuit
in
the
hill
case,
all
of
the
circuit
court's
opinions
uniformly
applied
the
state
rule
of
contributory
negligence
to
suits
under
wrongful
death
actions
of
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
not
on
this
point.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
no
sir,
not
on
this
point.
to
my
knowledge
every
decision
before
halecki
and
even
one
after
halecki
in
the
hill
case
have
applied
the
state
rule
of
contributory
negligence.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
if
i
may
say
quite
to
the
contrary
your
honor,
that
if
these
rights
are
not
determined
in
accordance
with
their
arguing
we
have
extreme
lack
of
uniformity.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
if
you
will
permit
me
–
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
my
very
next
point
deals
exactly
with
that
argument.
the
reason
it
comes
up
is
this,
that
in
the
circuit
court,
the
majority
of
opinion
in
halecki
agreed
that
before
the
pope
&
talbot
against
hawn
case
that
contributory
negligence
would
have
been
the
rule
but
mr.,
rather
judge
learned
hand
read
the
pope
&
talbot
v.
hawn
case
to
change
the
rule.
and
here,
we
--
i
think
we
--
it
comes
to
the
issue
which
your
honor
has
raised.
hawn
was
an
injured
but
living
plaintiff
and
his
right
without
question
originated
in
the
maritime
law.
however,
he
didn't
have
to
rely
on
the
state
law
as
halecki
did.
he
had
his
own
rights.
his
rights
were
correctly
measured
by
the
maritime
rule
of
comparative
negligence.
however,
the
rights
are
completely
different
not
only
in
origin
but
in
nature.
a
--
a
living
plaintiff
has
a
right
to
recover
for
his
own
damages
most
primarily
that
of
pain
and
suffering,
medical
expenses,
and
his
lost
income.
his
dependents
however
on
his
death
have
an
entirely
different
item
of
damage,
an
entirely
different
right
which
didn't
exist
either
in
maritime
law
or
the
common
law
and
that
is
to
recover
for
their
lost
not
the
decedent's
lost.
their
own
lost
that
is
anticipated
due
to
income
occasioned
by
the
death.
now,
the
fact
that
--
that
there
is
such
an
extreme
difference
is
demonstrated
by
the
existence
in
new
jersey
as
in
other
places
of
two
separate
statutes,
the
wrongful
death
act
which
we
have
here
and
the
survival
statute
which
doesn't
create
a
new
right
in
the
defendant
but
preserves
the
right
that
this
decedent
had
prior
to
his
death.
in
other
words,
under
survival
statute
an
state
can
recover
for
the
pain
and
suffering
he
--
he
suffered
before
he
died.
they
can
recover
for
his
medical
expenses,
but
that's
not
the
statute
we
have
before
us.
now,
the
respondent
has
raised
exactly
your
honor's
argument
in
what
they
have
termed
the
such
as
wood
argument,
the
language
of
the
statute
says
in
effect
that
an
act
such
as
wood
have
given
rights
to
an
action
if
the
man
had
lived,
she
will
give
his
defendants
a
cause
of
action
and
the
wrongful
death
statute
and
the
defendant
has
argued
also
that
it's
incongruous
to
say
if
the
man
had
lived
that
he
would
have
had
a
right
to
--
would
narrow
it
to
say
comparative
negligence
but
then
if
he
died
his
family
should
be
circumscribed
by
a
liable
contributory
negligence.
however,
bearing
in
mind
that
these
rights
are
completely
distinct.
it
--
it
is
not
only
incongruous
but
it's
--
it's
inescapable.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well
your
honor,
i
can't
--
i
am
afraid
i
can't
answer
that
except
to
say
that
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
have
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
am
quite
certain
your
honor,
there
is
difference
in
terminology
and
in
application.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
am
sure
they
do.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
question
of
uniformity
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
this
your
honor
that
all
of
the
lord
campbell's
act
provides
to
dependents
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
their
damages
which
they
did
not
have
in
absence
of
statute.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
am
--
i
am
sure
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
very
true
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well
if
i
may
point
out,
your
honor,
if
it
wasn't
for
the
statutes,
these
class
of
claimants
would
have
no
right
whatsoever.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
in
our
particular
question
on
the
point
of
uniformity
that
if
the
rights
of
these
litigants
are
not
enforced
in
accordance
with
the
--
their
origins,
you'll
have
a
situation
like
this
that
a
maritime
defendant
is
the
only
defendant
that
can
be
sued
under
the
wrongful
death
act
and
not
have
the
right
to
defend
on
the
basis
of
contributory
negligence.
he
is
the
only
type
of
defendant
that
whose
obligations
arise
out
of
state
law.
please
bear
in
mind
that
this
defendant
could
not
be
sued
in
this
matter
at
all
if
it
wasn't
for
the
wrongful
death
act
of
new
jersey,
but
at
the
same
time
it
takes
away
from
the
defendant
the
right
or
the
defenses
that
aren't
here
in
the
act.
moreover,
on
the
other
hand,
a
maritime
claimant
gets
preferential
treatment
under
the
wrongful
death
act,
in
that,
their
action
did
not
circumscribe
by
contributory
negligence
or
as
every
other
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
this
is
a
state
originated
right,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
state,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
it's
also
an
action
under
the
wrongful
death
act
of
new
jersey,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
in
our
case
--
in
our
case,
we
are
in
the
federal
court
because
of
diversity.
now
he
--
the
claimant
could
just
as
well
have
gone
under
to
the
saving
suited
for
into
the
state
court
and
the
same
result
would
occur.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well
your
honor,
that's
the
question
in
the
previous
case.
my
opinion
is
no.
as
i
understand
if
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
that
that
has
not
been
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
am
quite
sure
levinson
did
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
am
not
certain
about
judge.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
as
a
matter
of
fact
i,
i
believe
there
was
diversity
in
--
in
the
skovgaard
case.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
am
saying
this,
that
the
remedy
doesn't
change
the
origin
of
the
right.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
it's
a
state
right
your
honor,
if
you
will,
not
a
state
remedy.
the
remedy
would
have
to
deal
with
the
manner
in
which
it
would
draw,
the
form
in
which
it
was
brought.
the
right
remains
the
state
right.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
said
i
thought
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
was
in
error
then,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
don't
think
that
our
problem
is
necessarily
one
of
diversities.
i
think
it's
one
of
our
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
in
my
opinion,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
in
admiralty,
whether
it's
on
the
civil
side.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
--
the
question,
i
believe,
was
answered
in
the
garrett
case
by
mr.
justice
black
when
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
i
must
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
i
--
i
must
respectfully
defer,
your
honor.
in
my
whole
approach
to
this,
i
haven't
felt
that
diversity
or
the
basis
for
bringing
the
case
into
either
an
admiralty
or
civil
court
was
germane
to
the
issue.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
as
--
as
i
understand
the
proposition,
it
is
--
that
if
the
court
is
considering
the
right
and
the
rules
that
are
to
be
applied
in
determining
it,
it
--
then
--
i
don't
want
to
be
redundant,
but
it
must
be
decided
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction
in
which
that
right
originated.
and
that
works
both
ways,
in
my
--
not
only
in
my
opinion,
but
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black.
and
not
to
oversimplify
it,
but
i
--
i
think
that
that
states
the
problem
and
answers
it.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
right.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well
--
well,
isn't
it
so,
your
honor,
that
the
existence
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
indicates
an
intention
to
leave
to
the
various
states
the
determination
of
a
wrongful
death
act
where
it
happens
within
the
confines
of
the
state.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
well,
i
think
also
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
--
if
i
may
say
so,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
appropriate
to
your
question,
your
honor.
in
--
in
the
time
that
i
have
left,
i
have
to
completely
skip
over
my
second
point,
because
it's
in
common
with
this
skovgaard
case,
which
immediately
follows,
and
that's
the
argument
that
the
death
act
of
new
jersey
doesn't
include
or
encompass
unseaworthiness
at
all.
and
i'll
have
to
leave
that
one
to
mr.
o'neil
because
of
the
time.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
on
our
third
question
which
is
the
one
in
which
the
government
has
joined
as
friend
of
the
court
and
also
the
one
which
elicited
mr.
--
rather
judge
lumbard's
strong
dissent
in
the
second
circuit,
and
that
is
whether
the
--
the
nature
of
the
employment
of
this
decedent,
completely
apart
from
any
of
other
considerations,
entitles
him
to
unseaworthiness.
now,
in
my
brief,
i've
gone
through
sieracki
and
pope
&
talbot
against
hawn,
we
have
no
time
for
that
now.
i
can
only
say
this
about
halecki's
work.
he
was
a
shoreside
electrician.
most
of
his
work
was
ashore.
he
was
employed
by
a
subcontract,
hired
by
the
repair
yard,
which
was
not
itself
equipped
to
do
the
very
specialized
work
that
he
had
to
do.
his
work
can
only
be
done
when
the
vessel
was
out
of
operation.
this
ship
had
been
a
dead
vessel
for
about
two
weeks.
the
very
nature
of
the
work
cleaning
generators
could
only
be
done
while
the
vessel's
power
was
bought.
it
was
work,
as
far
as
we
know
that
no
seaman
could
ever
do.
seaman
employed
in
cruise
as
electricians,
do
only
maintenance
work.
this
was
--
work
so
specialized
that
they
had
to
take
the
seamen
off
the
vessel,
take
the
repair
yard
men
off
the
vessel,
in
order
to
have
it
done.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
would
say
it
was
not
in
this
respect.
the
government
has
raised
that
issue
in
its
brief
and
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
was
in
the
nature
of
extensive
overhauling
and
repairs,
not
incident
to
the
voyage
in
the
same
way
that
cleaning
cargo
tanks
for
example,
or
cleaning
pitch
from
a
cargo
compartment.
we
maintain
that
this
was
not
incident
to
the
vessel
and
that
the
equipment
itself,
i
may
--
if
i
may
take
30
seconds,
the
equipment,
itself,
was
not
the
type
of
equipment
that
was
considered
in
the
patterson
case.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
unseaworthiness
went
to
the
jury.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
only
in
general
terms.
they
were
permitted
to
consider
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness
over
the
objections
of
the
defendant.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
it
was
merely
submitted
to
them
in
a
general
way
and
the
charge
in
the
trial
judge.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
i
--
i
don't
understand
(inaudible).
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
there's
no
question
they
have
used.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mahoney
no
dispute.
the
vessel
was
in
navigable
waters
without
of
operation.
thank
you.
