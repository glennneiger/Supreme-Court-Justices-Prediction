well,
that's
the
very
issue
here,
that's
that

when
i
look
to
state
law
i
find
the
relevance.

the

justice

i
thought
his
question
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
garrett
case
did
not
have.
justice

and
i
say
it
wasn't.

it
does
if
you
accept
the
word,

creating

rooted

the
state
law
or
rooted

the

as
meaning
that
admiralty,
a
case
which
is
enforceable
and
that
rises
on
the
high
seas
is
rooted
in
the
state
law,
rather
than
the
federal.
as
i
understood
his
question,
if
we
base
on
the
assumption
that
there
might
be
a
difference,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
since
here,
what
admiralty
has
done
was
to
abolish
its
or
to
withdraw
away
from
his
whole
idea
in
some
instances
that
admiralty
would
not
enforce
a
death
claim,
that
it
would
enforce
a
death
claim.
therefore,
the
question
is,
if
it
doesn't
enforce
a
death
claim
because
it
is
allowed
in
the
state,
does
it
enforce
it
with
all
the
limitations
of
state
law,
does
it
enforce
it,
but
only
in
--
with
such
limitations
only,
as
in
accordance
with
and
harmony
with
general
principles
of
admiralty
law.

apparently,
isn't
it
fair
to
