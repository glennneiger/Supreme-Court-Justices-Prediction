justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
before
you
go
on
with
the
defense,
tell
me
what's
your
right
of
--
what's
the
right
action
made
on
which
your
brought
this
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
--
is
that
coming
down
between
you
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
contention
is
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
(inaudible)
new
jersey,
the
defenses
also
derived
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
new
jersey
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
become
--
that
would
be
a
(inaudible)
action
brought
in
new
jersey
court,
if
it
could
have
been
brought,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
if
it's
brought
in
the
federal
court.
is
that
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
it's
supplement,
litigating
is
done
in
the
federal
court
as
part
of
the
general
maritime,
as
the
enforceable
of
the
maritime
law
to
the
federal
court
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
it's
supplement,
why
then
does
this
become
(inaudible)
by
adoption
of
the
federal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
what
you're
saying
it
has
none
but
it
adopts
(inaudible)
or
whatever
the
verdict
adopts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
itself
does
not
give
provide
in
the
state
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
my
question
is
why
--
when
there
is
such
adoption,
why
doesn't
that
will
then
become
part
of
the
federal
law
fabric?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mahoney
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
i
have
to
call
a
general
attention
to
it.
how
many
states
have
these
death
statute
on
waters
that
are
recoverable
under
the
general
maritime
law
into
federal
courts,
48
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
talking
about
--
i
am
trying
to
get
a
meaning
with
these
rather
application
concept
(inaudible).
i
want
to
know
what
the
exact
thing
of
the
statutes
of
law
of
the
48
state
on
this
subject
is
which
is
then
enforced
in
the
federal
court
and
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
a
uniformity.
does
the
statute
differ
to
the
amount
--
maximum
amount
recovered,
as
to
the
categories
of
people
who
may
recover?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
talking
about
terminology.
i
am
talking
about
who
can
recover
for
what
and
what
amount.
do
the
48
states
differ
in
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
there
isn't
uniformity
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
not
generally,
but
specifically,
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
if
under
jersey
you've
got
one
right
and
under
carolina
or
alabama
law
you've
got
a
totally
different
right,
both
enforceable
as
supplementary
to
the
general
maritime
law
but
what
plaintiff
actually
gets
or
who
can
be
plaintiff,
it
maybe
very
different
in
the
two
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
these
things
you
haven't
got
uniformity,
because
it
all
depends
on
the
varying
--
on
the
varying
statutes
and
legislation
of
the
various
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
true
or
it
isn't
that
a
number
of
statutes,
of
lord
campbell's
statute,
which
states
have
enacted
have
--
have
fixed
amounts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maximum
amount.
isn't
it
from
the
(inaudible)
have
written
into
them
specific
limitations
by
way
of
statute
of
limitations
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
have
got
a
great
diversity
of
concrete
ingredients
in
a
specific
state
statute
which
however
are
enforceable
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
get
a
--
you
get
a
jacob's
coat
pattern
and
not
the
uniformity
pattern
in
this
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
starting
point,
but
it
makes
to
me
a
lot
of
difference.
whether
you've
got
a
general
united
states
statute
giving
uniformity
in
results
or
when
you've
got
a
48
diversified
opportunities
for
suing
in
the
federal
court
if
the
state
gives
you
--
what
right
it
gives
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
couldn't
you
in
this
case
go
into
the
federal
court
although
there
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
talking
about
the
bringing
it
under
law
applies.
can't
you
bring
--
you
cannot
bring
this
except
under
diversities
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
--
you
can't
bring
it
as
an
admiralty
--
you
can't
make
the
federal
admiralty
law
without
jury
available
to
a
right
as
(inaudible),
are
those
--
did
those
cases
rest
on
diversity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mahoney,
i
asked
you
(inaudible)
what
was
the
last
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
specifically
said,
it
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
the
questions
of
your
being
in
error
(inaudible)
what
problems
that
justice
brennan
put
to
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
said
that
typically,
it
isn't
diversity
in
theory
and
(inaudible)
there's
nothing
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
if
--
if
jurisdiction
would
sustain
there
when
it's
not
derived
from
diversity
and
(inaudible)
to
say
there
was
no
diversity
in
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
i
--
i
can
follow
that
argument.
but
it
does
make
a
difference
in
the
analogies
whether
on
(inaudible)
or
whether
the
cause
of
action
to
derive
approximately,
and
then
the
question,
if
i
may
say
so,
put
by
my
brother
(inaudible)
a
question
that
has
to
be
faced
or
met,
namely,
to
--
in
the
federal
court
because
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
may
you
have
to
answer
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
if
not
--
they're
not
capable
of
answering
when
we
put
tough
questions
(inaudible)
they're
capable
so
it
must
be
answered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
claim
wouldn't
stop
with
that
proposition
otherwise
we'll
get
lost
because
we
got
very
different
considerations
if
it
is
--
if
they're
addressed
to
the
problem
in
the
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
on
this
question,
on
the
first
thing
that
--
that's
run
by
dissent,
this
was
not
the
vessel.
this
was
not
--
that's
right.
there
couldn't
be
unseaworthiness
regarding
this
--
this
vessel.
was
there
any
--
is
that
disputed
or
the
fact
about
that
disputed
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
lumbard
and
you're
arguing,
the
government
argues
that
the
vessel
was
--
was
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
water
that
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
fact
on
which
such
a
determination
maybe
made,
assuming
it's
relevant,
are
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
baker
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
anyone
say
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
the
--
in
any
sense
that
has
concrete
unambiguous
meaning,
this
vessel
was
laid
up
for
overhauling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
is
this
--
this
vessel
not
tied-up
to
the
overhaul
and
repair
and
not
next
week
or
the
week
thereafter,
to
be
in
operation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
law
is
clear.
but
if
there
is
law
about
which
one
can
be
definite,
that
if
a
vessel
is
laid
up
for
overhauling
and
repair
is
taking
out
of
service
for
overhauling
and
repair
and
tied
up
to
a
dock,
is
it
that
--
does
adopting
of
seaworthiness
can
apply
to
a
vessel
in
that
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what's
the
vessel,
i
mean
that,
is
it
a
vessel
if
it's
taken
out
of
operation
for
purposes
of
admiralty
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
they
taking
out
of
navigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
applies
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
that
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
not
apply
only
to
a
vessel
in
operation?
if
a
vessel
is
tied
up
and
is
not
to
be
in
operation
to
be
overhauled,
changed,
repaired,
a
new
solution
and
whatnot,
is
--
is
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
apply
to
a
vessel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
vessel
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
a
vessel
is
tied
up
for
six
months,
not
to
go
--
a
vessel
has
been
in
the
mediterranean
voyage
and
tied
up
here
for
extensive
repairs,
but
the
crew
was
allowed
to
sleep
on
board.
you
say
that
all
the
admiralty
law
affecting
members
of
the
crew
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
proof
that
justice
stewart
was
seaworthy.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
determines
--
who
would
finally
can
determine
whether
unseaworthiness
does
or
doesn't
come
within
new
jersey
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
court
--
did
this
court
has
the
last
saying
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
judge
in
the
supreme
court
next
week,
holds
that
it's
outside
of
new
jersey
death
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
substitute
--
stop
a
minute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
new
jersey
supreme
court
say,
our
statute
doesn't
include
under
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
a
case
then
came
up
here,
we
have
to
follow
new
jersey
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
seaworthy?
is
the
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness,
the
cause
of
action
for
a
breach
of
warranty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
could
--
it
could
--
as
because
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
warrant
or
doesn't
warrant.
the
law
says
you
must
supply
a
ship
that's
seaworthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
you
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
warrant
it
or
not,
it
must
be
seaworthy.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
telling
the
owner
that
ship
(inaudible)
this
is
warrant
and
warranty
stepped
out
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
the
owner
of
the
vessel
say
i
don't
want
--
i
don't
warrant
this
ship
to
be
seaworthy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
nothing
to
do
with
the
vessel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
might
say
anything,
but
the
point
is
that
the
law
says
we
don't
care
what
--
you
as
owner
warrant
or
don't
warrant,
if
certain
things
happen
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
remember
that
something
is
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
baker,
maritime
law
excludes
the
recovery
for
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
characteristic
of
maritime
law
is
not
to
give
a
recovery
for
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
adopt
something
that
the
state
doesn't
give.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
see,
if
i
could
help
you
out
some
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
you
did
the
recovery
for
death
(inaudible)
shall
exclude
death
as
admiralty
--
admiralty
situation.
you
will
wipe
that
out
because
the
state
can't
discriminate
against
giving
recovery
for
admiralty
situation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
state
gives
a
recovery
for
death
into
the
common
law,
lord
campbell's
act,
but
qualifies
it
and
as
this
part
of
it
qualifies,
so
as
not
to
apply
for
death
resulting
from
unseaworthiness,
that's
an
unfair
discrimination
against
the
admiralty
law
and
that
would
drop
out
in
the
rest
of
the
lord
campbell's
act
instead.
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
brought
this
action
in
a
jersey
court,
jersey
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
mean,
if
you
could've
serve
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't,
but
assuming
you
could
have
serve
them,
you
could
then
have
brought
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
new
jersey
court.
and
i
take
it
from
your
answers
of
the
jersey
court,
couldn't
apply
its
own
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
have
the
maritime
law,
although
the
statute
says
what
justice
harlan
implied
that
you
can't
recover
from
unseaworthiness.
