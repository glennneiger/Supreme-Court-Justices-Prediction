can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
in
your
view,
we
can
have
the
last
word
and
say
new
jersey
law
is
that
we
were
to
come
to
conclusion
that
the
unseaworthiness
is
not
embraced
in
the
lord
campbell's
--
new
jersey
lord
campbell's
act.
have
you
still
got
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
we
concluded
that
the
new
jersey
statute,
the
new
jersey
wrongful
death
statute
did
not
--
did
not
embrace
claims
for
unseaworthiness,
where
does
that
leave
you
on
your
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
a
new
jersey
statute
had
said
in
terms,
under
our
wrongful
death
statute,
which
gives
all
kinds
of
causes
of
actions
towards
--
but
not
unseaworthiness
claims

justice
john
m.
harlan
--
supposing
you
said
that
specifically

justice
john

would
you
then
say
that
you
still
had
the
cause
of
action?
