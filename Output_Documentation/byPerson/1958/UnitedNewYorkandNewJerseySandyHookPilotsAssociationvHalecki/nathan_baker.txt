mr.
nathan
baker
mr.
chief
justice
--
please
the
court.
a
desire,
if
i
may,
at
the
outset,
set
forth
some
of
the
pertinent
facts,
not
the
detailed
facts,
but
some
of
the
pertinent
facts
which
may
be
involved
in
the
legal
discussions
which
i
expect
to
make
shortly.
first,
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
honors'
attention
that
this
vessel
was
in
the
waters,
at
a
dock,
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
that
aboard
this
vessel,
when
it's
undisputed,
at
least,
the
facts
supported,
was
the
captain
and
four
or
five
deck
men,
there
was
a
full
compliment
of
the
engine
crew
and
there,
those
men
were
doing
maintenance
work
at
the
same
time
that
this
maintenance
or
overhauling
work
was
being
done
by
the
shipyard
men,
during
the
entire
time.
i'd
like
to
bring
also
to,
your
honors'
attention
that
the
specification
of
repairs
which
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
my
brief,
sets
forth
that
the
crew,
meaning
the
ship's
crew,
was
to
remove
and
replace
the
eight
cylinder
heads
from
--
for
the
port
and
start
with
generators.
that
the
very
generators
which
were
to
be
cleaned
by
this
plaintiff,
this
halecki,
the
very
generator
was
removed
and
replaced
by
the
ship's
crew
and
then
it
provided
in
that
specifications
which
spray
clean
with
carbon
tetrachloride.
in
other
words,
the
work
to
be
done
by
this
halecki,
the
shore-side
electrician,
was
to
spray
clean
with
carbon
tetrachloride,
so
set
forth
in
the
specification
repairs
of
this
defendant,
the
vessel,
and
so
ordered
and
directed
by
this
defendant.
and
it
was
known
that
it
was
a
dangerous
substance
in
confined
spaces
and
it
was
for
use
in
the
engine
room.
and
not
only
was
it
known,
but
the
chief
engineer
in
consultation
with
the
foreman
of
the
deceased,
agreed
to
have
the
work
done
on
a
day
when
the
members
of
the
crew
won't
be
present.
and
that
was
just
suddenly
when
this
occurrence
occurred.
and
they
cleared
the
vessel
of
the
members
of
the
crew
from
doing
all
the
work
and
they
just
had
a
watchman,
a
ship's
watchman
aboard,
and
they
started
to
do
this
work.
mr.
nathan
baker
yes.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
would
call
it
laid
up,
your
honor.
and
not
when
the
ship's
crew
--
in
other
words,
if
you've
timed
the
word
laid
up,
where
the
ship's
crew
was
off,
there
are
cases
where
the
ship's
crew
is
off,
the
vessel
is
out
of
commission;
there's
nothing
being
done
except
shipyard
work,
is
not
this
case.
mr.
nathan
baker
well
it
was
the
overhauled,
so
in
preparation,
preferred
operation.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i
don't
think
the
law
is
clear
on
that.
i
don't
think
the
law
is
clear.
it's
still
considered
a
vessel.
as
long
as
it's
considered
a
vessel
--
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
would
say
that
i
understand
that
it's
still
considered
a
vessel
while
it's
still
in
the
--
in
the
--
under
water.
mr.
nathan
baker
oh,
well,
those
--
mr.
nathan
baker
--
are
cases
dealing
with
the
jones
act
cases.
mr.
nathan
baker
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
baker
yes.
well
in
the
jones
act
--
mr.
nathan
baker
those
cases
are
desperate
cases,
your
honors,
it's
where
the
vessel
was
taken
out
of
navigation
and
was
there
held
that
it
was
not
a
vessel
for
the
purpose
of
jones
act
cases.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
--
i
--
this
is
not
a
jones
act
case.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i'm
really
--
i
--
i
don't
--
we
don't
reach
the
problem
in
our
case.
i
--
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
vessel
was
taken
out
and
that
it's
similar
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
baker
on
the
facts.
mr.
nathan
baker
not
on
the
facts.
we
don't
come
within
that.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
would
say
yes.
and
i
would
say
--
i
will
explain
why.
if
a
vessel
was
tied
up
and
there's
a
member
of
the
crew
aboard
that
vessel,
while
it's
tied
up
doing
whatever
they're
doing
even
if
they're
just
sleeping
there,
if
that
member
of
the
crew
was
injured
aboard
the
vessel,
even
though
it's
tied
up
for
repairs,
and
extensive
repairs
even,
and
that
member
of
the
crew
is
injured,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
it's
still
amply
covered
in
the
maritime
law.
otherwise,
what
would
you
say
that
that
member
of
the
crew
was
not
entitled
to
any
recovery,
i'm
--
as
to
my
tougher
question.
this
is
not
entitled
to
any
recovery,
what
does
he
get,
only
compensation?
mr.
nathan
baker
and
that's
my
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
any
such
decision
of
this
court
that
says
that,
but
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
hope
--
i
hope,
your
honor,
would
agree
with
me
then
that
you
would
have
a
seaworthy
vessel.
mr.
nathan
baker
now,
i
--
i'd
like
to
also
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
thompson,
the
watchman,
testified
and
when
they
asked
him
what
his
work
was,
he
says
it
was
general
overhaul
and
minor
repairs.
i
just
bring
it
to
your
honors'
attention
to
the
purpose
of
any
of
the
factual
question
that
maybe
raised.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
me,
i
think,
to
discuss
the
negligence
aspect
of
this
case,
the
question
of
the
negligence
of
the
vessel
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
fact
the
trial
judge
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
two
points,
one
is
negligence;
one
is
unseaworthiness.
and
i'd
like
to
bring
to
your
honors'
attention,
which
has
not
been
brought
out
yet,
that
there
was
two
cause
of
action
here.
the
first
cause
of
action
was
the
survival
action,
namely,
for
the
rights
of
the
deceased
up
to
the
time
of
his
death.
and
then
in
that
action
the
jury
bought
in
$2500.
and
the
second
cause
of
action
is
the
death
action.
the
right
of
the
representatives,
the
widow
and
children
in
this
case
or
the
death
of
the
deceased
and
that
action
the
jury
board
in
$62,500
and
that's
the
verdicts
in
those
cases.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
evidence
which
is
submitted
on
the
negligence
and
the
--
was
sustained
by
a
jury
and
that
it
be
unnecessary
for
me
to
go
into
the
question
on
negligence.
in
fact
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
lumbard,
also
agreed
that
the
question
of
negligence
was
one
probably
submitted
to
the
jury.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
the
first
question
to
be
determined
and
that
i'd
like
to
argue
before
your
honors,
is,
was
the
deceased
in
his
lifetime
entitles
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
on
this
vessel?
that's
the
first
question
--
in
his
lifetime.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
this
man
was
a
shore-side
electrician.
and
that,
no
electrician
is
certainly
considered
as
members
of
the
ship's
crew.
and
that
under
the
sieracki
case,
mean
even
though
the
work
was
puzzled
out
to
other
people,
that
the
puzzling
out
of
this
work
for
a
shore-side
electrician
does
not
deprive
him
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
so
that
--
and
two
reasons,
first
this
electrician
which
i
don't
think
it
needs
any
extensive
argument
to
indicate
electricians
are
members
of
the
ship's
crew.
and
secondly,
the
work
that
he
was
doing
was
maintenance
work
--
cleaning
--
so
what
he
was
doing
was
cleaning
these
generators
in
the
engine
room.
and
certainly
cleaning,
the
maintenance
work
is
essentially
ship's
work,
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
it's
work
not
only
traditionally,
but
actually
performed
by
seamen
up
to
present
time.
i
have
included
in
my
briefs
some
extracts
of
coast
guard
proceedings
which
i
think,
your
honor,
may
take
judicial
notice
where
it
indicates
that
this
type
of
work
is
described
to
be
done
by
the
seamen
that
talks
about
use
of
carbon
tetrachloride,
the
dangers
involved
and
so
forth.
and
i
brought
it
to
your
honors'
attention
in
my
brief.
mr.
nathan
baker
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
baker
no,
your
honor,
the
--
if
i
may
say,
the
crew
is
the
ship's
crew.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
nathan
baker
the
contractor
is
the
shipyard's
contractor.
mr.
nathan
baker
they
would
do
this
work
and
they
--
mr.
nathan
baker
was
he
--
he
was
not
employed
by
the
--
mr.
nathan
baker
--
with
the
subcontractor.
and
that
was
his
work
to
do,
that's
right.
and
his
work
was
to
do
the
cleaning.
now,
the
question
is
the
cleaning
and
the
maintenance
work
that
he's
done,
had
to
do
in
this.
would
that
--
and
now
it
gets
to
seamen's
duties,
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
its
general
maintenance
work
which
is
now
the
seaman's
duties
and
i
think
that
he
comes
within
the
--
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
the
--
the
record
has
found
that
for
that.
i
would
say
that.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
--
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
tariff
and
--
is
it
all
of
this
in
the
traditional
situation
--
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this
that
in
the
past
years,
and
even
at
the
present
time,
even
if
you
look
at
the
coast
guard
procedures,
they're
still
cleaning
their
own
engines
and
their
own
generators
with
these
various
substances.
now,
if
they
use
this
carbon
tetrachloride
they're
warned
about
the
dangers
of
it.
now,
it
happened
in
this
case,
they
decided
to
delegate
that
work
to
a
general
contractor
namely,
the
shipyards
workers.
and
the
shipyard
work
is
still
sub-delegated
again
to
the
electrical
company
who
had
this
halecki
do
the
work.
and
i
submit,
to
your
honor,
that
meaning
that
he
was
doing
the
work
traditionally
done
by
seamen
--
well,
actually
today
is
done
by
seamen,
may
i
bring
out
as
kind
of
an
illustration
a
decision
which
my
judge
--
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
that's
the
argument
made,
but
i
say
no.
i
think
that
the
court
may
work
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i
would
say
no.
there
is
no
real
specialization
of
this
type
of
work.
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
kind
of
work,
the
cleaning
of
--
of
generators
is
done
by
all
seamen.
mr.
nathan
baker
no.
mr.
nathan
baker
of
seaworthiness
and
negligence.
i
submit
to
your
honors
an
illustration,
a
case
decision
by
judge
wright
in
a
case
of
a
shore-based
plumber-machinist,
where
he's
repairing
a
small
pipe
in
a
laboratory.
and
in
that
case,
judge
wright
indicated
on
page
22
of
my
brief,
i
may
just
read
a
few
lines,
the
top
of
page
23.
"if
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
applies
to
landsmen
aboard
a
vessel,
performing
work
historically
performed
by
seamen,
it
should
certainly
be
applied
to
landsmen
aboard
performing
work
currently
performed
by
seamen
and
i
submit
to
our
case
is
analogous
that
he's
a
plumber
--
plumber
fixing
a
pipe
and
he
was
his
electrician
not
repairing,
just
--
just
cleaning
a
mechanism.
and
judge
learned
hand
has
indicated
in
his
decision
in
the
court
below
and
i
think
he
can
say
it
in
much
better
language
than
i
can,
that
he
sees
no
distinction
between
the
work
being
done
by
halecki
and
the
work
being
done
by
hawn,
in
the
hawn
pope
&
talbot
case.
and
he
thinks
that
the
test
is
whether
the
work
is
of
trying
to
traditionally
the
crew
is
in
the
(inaudible)
and
as
to
that,
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
means
employed
have
changed
with
time.
and
he
therefore,
felt
that
since
the
deceased
would
clean
the
ship,
he
was
within
the
doctrine
of
pope
&
talbot
and
hawn,
and
he
entitled
to
seaworthy
vessel.
now,
our
case
or
my
counsel
has
not
gone
into,
although
he
didn't
agree
--
gone
at
this
very
hill
and
a
few
other
cases.
our
case
can
be
distinguished
from
those
cases.
first,
we're
not
the
driver.
second,
we
were
not
in
major
repairs
and
no
structural
change
was
being
made
with
just
minor
repairs
and
overhauling.
and
in
that
case,
in
those
cases,
the
crew
was
discharged.
in
our
case,
the
crew
was
on
board,
performed
the
work
and
not
discharged.
and
i
submit
that
none
of
these
factors
appear,
if
they're
material
in
our
case,
which
would
justify
any
decision
contrary
to
our
argument
here.
and
i
go
into
my,
the
next
point,
if
i
may,
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
recover
by
the
representatives
of
the
deceased
for
the
wrongful
death.
namely,
here
we
have
a
situation
where
under
the
hawn
case,
pope
&
talbot
against
hawn,
if
the
person
was
alive
and
halecki
was
alive,
it's
undisputed
under
that
case,
a
decision
by
justice
black,
that
he
would
have
two
rights
of
recovering,
namely
one,
for
negligence
and
two,
for
unseaworthiness,
and
i
might
add
in
there
that
contributory
negligence
would
not
be
a
bar,
but
the
admiralty
rule
of
comparative
negligence
would
apply.
but
here
we
have
not
a
--
personally
the
case,
but
a
death
case.
and
in
order
to
recover
under
the
maritime
law,
which
is
silent
as
to
recovery
for
death,
the
wrongful
death
and
the
court
was
required
to
adopt
the
wrongful
death
act
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
where
this
acts
occurred.
and
in
adopting
it,
it
then
gave
this
cause
of
action.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
in
looking
at
the
new
jersey
act,
which
has
been
adopted
under
the
maritime
law
so
as
to
give
it
force
and
effect,
we
look
at
new
jersey
act,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
act
has
a
referral
clause
in
it.
in
other
words,
it
refers
back
to
the
rights
which
the
deceased
would
have
had
if
he
had
lived.
and
that's
on
page
29
of
my
brief.
"when
a
death
of
a
person
is
caused
by
a
wrongful
act,
neglect
or
default,
such
as
would
if
death
had
not
ensued,
have
entitled
the
person
to
sue."
now,
referring
to
that
such
as
clause
as
we
termed
them
refers
to
the
rights
which
the
deceased
would
have
had
if
he
had
lived.
we
look
at
the
pope
&
talbot-hawn
case,
the
deceased
would
have
had
the
right
of
--
abhor
the
rights
of
negligence
and
the
right
of
cause
of
action
on
seaworthiness.
and
i
submit
that
under
that
recall
clause,
the
representative
of
the
deceased,
the
widow
and
children,
are
entitled
to
the
same
two
cause
of
action,
which
includes
this
action
for
unseaworthiness.
now
then,
the
question
arises
is
the
death
act
of
new
jersey,
which
is
silent
in
using
the
word,
unseaworthiness.
have
we
say
that
unseaworthiness
comes
under
the
term,
wrongful
act
neglect
or
default.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
without
arguing
in
great
detail,
that
certainly,
it
means
more
than
neglect
because
neglect
is
the
negative
cause
of
action
and
that
the
wrongful
act
for
the
fault
can
be
and
must
be
to
construe
to
include
the
term,
unseaworthiness.
mr.
nathan
baker
well
--
mr.
nathan
baker
it
has
not
been
determined
by
any
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i
would
say
that
it
does.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
think,
in
the
court
would
take
that
consideration,
but
i
have
another
argument
which
i'm
going
to
contend
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i
will.
mr.
nathan
baker
sure,
they
could.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
nathan
baker
i'm
going
to
come
into
that
argument
later,
your
honor.
i'll
--
i'll
come
right
into
it.
now,
under
the
jersey
act,
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
it's
a
remedial
statute.
and
--
and
there
is
a
--
and
there's
a
little
construction
impended
of
that
statute
and
certainly
it
does
not
intend,
we
submit,
to
give
to
the
deceased,
the
--
the
representative,
widow
and
children
of
the
deceased,
less
right
than
the
persons
would've
had,
if
he
lived
and
the
little
construction
of
the
statute
which
permits
this
recovery
for
unseaworthiness
by
the
representative
of
the
deceased.
mr.
nathan
baker
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
a
reading
of
the
statute,
it
won't
block
the
default,
is
a
--
that
unseaworthiness
is
a
tort,
a
maritime
tort.
and
that
--
and
i
was
just
about
to
come
to
the
next
point
in
discussing
the
justin
case
in
new
jersey
which
justice
brennan
at
that
time
was
judge
of
the
supreme
court.
in
that
case,
he
argued
and
submitted
an
opinion
that
the
construction
of
the
--
this
death
act,
in
deciding
the
point
which
is
of
issue,
was
a
construction
that
it
included
not
only
negligence,
but
all
torts
including
breach
of
warranty.
and
under
that
construction
and
--
and
i
think
unseaworthiness
which
can
--
it
to
be
considered
as
a
---
as
a
breach
of
warranty
and
therefore,
would
come
under
the
unseaworthy
--
would
come
under
that
act
of
new
jersey.
i
might
say
further
and
i
quoted
two
--
in
my
brief,
two
english
decisions
which
we
all
know
that
the
lord
campbell's
act
was
an
english
act
and
our
new
jersey
act,
many
other
acts
have
fashioned
after
it,
and
in
the
zinc's
(ph)
the
court
might
be
--
it
indicates
that
each
warranty
is
included
within
the
recovery
under
the
lord
campbell's
act,
which
uses
the
same
language.
so
i
think
that
under
that
theory
and
including
judge
learned
hand's
decision
below,
that
unseaworthiness
comes
within
the
death
act
of
new
jersey,
even
though
not
mentioned
in
that
--
in
that
language.
mr.
nathan
baker
it's
--
it's
considered
the
nature,
i
submit,
of
the
breach
of
warranty.
in
other
words
--
mr.
nathan
baker
it
was.
mr.
nathan
baker
as
i
understand
it's
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
it
warrants
it
that
it's
seaworthy
and
its
warrant
irrespective
of
fault.
as
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
baker
as
i
understand
what
we
call
warranty
of
seaworthiness
and
that's
the
reason
we
viewed
that
term.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
think
so.
i
think
it's
almost
identical.
mr.
nathan
baker
i'm
just
--
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
do
have
to
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
think
that's
the
legal
obligation.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
it's
--
you
might
say
is
implied
warranty,
does
express
it
to
the
fact
that
owns
a
ship
is
warranted
that
it's
seaworthy.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
see.
mr.
nathan
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
didn't
quite
get
that,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
--
i
slip
to
your
honor
that
irrespective
of
the
construction
of
the
new
jersey
death
act
under
the
arguments
i'm
about
to
make
if
i
have
the
time,
that
maritime
law
covers.
in
other
words,
inasmuch
as
this
acts
--
and
occurred
a
ship,
that
maritime
law
is
the
paramount
law
in
governance.
and
that
the
only
reason
that
it
accepts
the
new
jersey
death
act
is
because
there's
a
void
in
the
maritime
law
given
him
the
right
of
recovery
for
that,
either
by
negligence
or
unseaworthiness.
and
it
fills
it.
it
adopts
into
the
maritime
law
the
state
laws,
so
as
to
give
this
cause
of
action.
and
i
submit
to,
your
honor,
that
when
it
does
so
and
adopts
it
even
without
this
referral
nature
which
is
not
necessary
in
our
case,
but
we
have
the
referral
nature
of
our
case
and
we
say
that
refers
back
to
the
rights
you
would
have
had,
if
he
had
lived.
but
even
irrespective
of
such
a
referral
statute
that
we
have
to
go
that
far,
we
don't
have
in
our
case,
i
submit
to,
your
honor,
that
as
it
absorbs
or
adopts
the
death
act,
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
maritime
law
and
it's
still
maritime
law,
which
governs
the
case.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
i
submit
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i
submit
--
mr.
nathan
baker
i'd
say
yes
for
this
reason
--
for
this
reasons,
i
may
say
under
the
case
of
just
against
chambers,
a
decision
by
chief
justice
hughes,
he
indicated
that
respect
to
maritime
tort,
we
have
held
that
the
state
may
modify
or
supplement
the
maritime
law
by
creating
liability
which
a
court
of
admiralty
will
recognize
and
enforce
when
the
state
action
is
not
hostile
to
the
characteristic
features
of
the
maritime
law
or
inconsistent
with
federal
legislation.
mr.
nathan
baker
but
maritime
law
in
all
the
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
nathan
baker
but
under
the
maritime
law,
in
order
to
give
the
recovery
and
to
take
the
place
of
this
void
in
the
law,
they
adopt
to
the
state
death
act
in
order
to
give
this
recovery.
mr.
nathan
baker
well,
you
can
adopt
the
part
of
this
which
gives
the
remedy
and
the
right
and
where
it's
repugnant
to
maritime
law,
for
instance,
if
there
was
such
a
clause
or
if
there
was
a
clause
in
the
--
in
the
statute
which
says
that
--
that
contribute
their
negligence
apply,
doesn't
pay
here.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
being
there
it's
--
with
hostile,
the
characteristic
feature
of
maritime
law,
it
will
adopt
the
part
which
becomes
a
part
of
maritime
law
and
not
adopt
the
part
that's
hostile
to
maritime
law.
mr.
nathan
baker
our
case
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far.
mr.
nathan
baker
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
baker
that's
my
contention.
mr.
nathan
baker
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
baker
and
i
just
as
much
don't
like,
i
lost
your
question
on
the
side.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
think
so.
it
says
solely
in
this
case
of
just
versus
chambers,
and
it
indicates
that
it's
repugnant
and
half
of
the
characteristic
features
of
maritime
law.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
doesn't
apply
in
our
particular
case
halecki
because
under
(inaudible)
cause
of
action
under
(inaudible)
the
--
of
the
--
under
the
state
act,
it
gets
the
same
cause
of
action
as
the
deceased
would've
had
if
he
had
lived
and
the
representatives,
the
widow
and
children,
would
have
the
same
cause
of
action,
namely,
the
right
of
action
for
negligence
and
the
right
of
action
on
seaworthiness
and
that
contributory
negligence
would
not
be
a
bar,
but
the
comparative
negligence
rule
would
apply.
now,
i
don't
know
how
much
time
i
have,
but
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
if
i
have
time
on
the
comparative
negligence
feature.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
nathan
baker
oh,
no.
mr.
nathan
baker
under
land
cases
--
mr.
nathan
baker
and
the
land
cases
contribute
to
make
an
absolute
bar.
and
if
the
contention
which
is
made
here
on
the
defense,
namely,
that
there
is
two
rules
to
be
applied
in
the
case
of
the
party,
if
he's
alive
on
the
hawn
case
and
the
party
to
represent
the
widow
and
children
case
of
a
death
case
that
we
have
here,
we
would
have
the
judge
charging
the
jury
in
this
case,
where
there's
one
cause
of
action
for
the
--
the
survivor
cause
of
action
where
the
jury
would
pay
$250.
he
have
to
say
to
the
jury,
“this
cause
of
action
is
on
to
this
hawn
case.”
and
it's
a
personal
injury
cause
of
action
the
same
as
if
he
would
have
to
be
alive
and
i'll
have
to
charge
the
jury
in
this
case,
the
recovery
can
be
held
only
for
negligence.
and
contributory
negligence
in
that
case
is
not
a
bar,
but
comparative
negligence
rule.
but
on
the
second
cause
of
action
with
the
death
case,
where
the
innocent
wife
and
children
who
were
not
guilty
of
any
negligence
as
far
as
they're
concerned,
his
charge
of
the
jury
would
be
that
being
that
it's
under
the
death
act
of
new
jersey
--
mr.
nathan
baker
comparative
negligence.
mr.
nathan
baker
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
baker
further
no
question
about
it.
mr.
nathan
baker
if
you
could
get
jurisdiction
of
these
parties.
mr.
nathan
baker
you
couldn't
serve
them,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
baker
oh,
yes.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
think
they
would
have
to
apply
maritime
law.
mr.
nathan
baker
i
would
like
to
say
that
you
might
have
to
say
anything
more.
mr.
nathan
baker
all
right.
i
might
say
that
on
the
theory
of
uniformity
that
justice
brennan
has
mentioned
and
which
appeared
from
his
decision
in
the
mcallister
against
magnolia
petroleum,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
on
the
theory
of
uniformity
in
order
to
get
uniform
law
to
have
one
law
where
the
man
is
alive
and
another
law
where
he
is
dead
and
the
--
and
the
--
and
where
the
representatives
had
sworn
and
to
say
that
contributory
negligence
is
a
bar
in
one
case
and
comparative
negligence
is
another
case,
would
certainly
not
lead
to
any
uniformity.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
hawn
case,
written
by
justice
black,
which
applies
to
personal
injury
case,
should
also
apply
to
a
death
case,
the
same
principles
of
law.
