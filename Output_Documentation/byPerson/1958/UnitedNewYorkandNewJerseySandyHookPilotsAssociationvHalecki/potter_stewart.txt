mr.
baker,
hasn't

or

i
mistaken

the
liability
for
unseaworthiness

any
reference
to
neglect
or
fault,
is
liability
without
fault.

well
isn't
your
new

statute
limited
by
the
first

very
first
clause
that

caused
by

wrongful

neglect
or
default,
not
by
something
that's
not
unconnected
with
fault.
justice
potter

very
close
to
a
breach
of
an
implied
warranty.
