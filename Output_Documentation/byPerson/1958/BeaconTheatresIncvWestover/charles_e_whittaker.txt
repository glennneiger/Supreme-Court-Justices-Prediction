justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
do
i
understand
that
you
argue
by
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
may
not
be
in
equity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
maybe
either.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
assume
the
fact
that
there
might
be
problems
(inaudible)
by
this
injunction
to
await
the
declaratory
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
hence
no
need
for
any
kind
of
injunction
if
the
judgment
in
the
suit
declared
the
rights
of
the
party,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
in
any
equity
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
in
your
by
warning,
if
i
understand
this
complaint,
say
not
only
if
they
did
do,
but
was
anticipated,
then
a
suit
would
be
filed,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
so,
your
contention
then
is,
that
they
were
entitled
not
to
the
adjudication
of
that
status
to
relation
but
they
had
to
go
ahead
and
commit
what
you
thought
was
a
violation
of
the
law
before
the
right
could
be
tested?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
say
the
(inaudible)
cause
of
action
alleged
was
legal
in
character
and
not
equity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
all
--
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
the
paramount
issue
would
be
a
determination
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
were
in
competition?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
determination
of
that
question
in
the
setting
of
this
complaint
was
a
legal
in
character.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
to
the
three
the
allegations
made,
if
none
of
the
three
is
in
competition
with
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
