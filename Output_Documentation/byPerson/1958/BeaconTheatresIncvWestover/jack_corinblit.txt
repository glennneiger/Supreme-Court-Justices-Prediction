mr.
jack
corinblit
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
this
honored
court.
this
case
presents
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
improperly
denied
petitioner
a
jury
trial
as
to
issues
related
to
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
whether
the
rules
of
law
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
accomplish
this
result
are
or
are
not
contrary
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
promulgated
by
this
court,
adopted
by
the
congress
and
are
contrary
to
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
case
briefly
arose
in
the
southern
district
of
california
wherein
a
complaint
was
filed
by
fox
west
coast
theatres
corporation.
the
complaint
was
captioned,
“fox
west
coast
theatres
corporation
versus
beacon
theaters,
inc.”
it
was
entitled
a
complaint
for
declaratory
relief.
after
the
petitioner
here,
was
named
defendant
there,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
that
was
denied.
petitioner
filed
an
answer
in
which
he
raised
an
affirmative
--
filed
an
answer
in
affirmative
defense,
filed
a
counterclaim
against
the
plaintiff
and
in
other
party
and
demanded
jury
trial
as
to
the
complaint,
the
answer
and
the
counterclaim.
the
grounds
upon
which
the
petitioner
argued
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
as
to
the
complaint
--
as
to
the
complaint
standing
alone
were
as
follows.
the
first,
that
the
seventh
amendment
guarantees
a
jury
trial
as
to
actions
of
law,
actions
of
common
law.
this
was
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
which
is
not
an
action
at
common
law
nor
is
it
an
action
traditionally
known
as
an
action
in
equity.
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
turns
upon
the
basic
nature
of
the
case
and
turns
upon
the
--
the
kind
of
the
case
for
which
the
declaratory
action
is
a
substitute.
that
in
this
action,
it
was
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
complaint,
from
the
allegations
contained
therein
that
it
was
a
substitute
for
an
antitrust
damage
suit
and
that
its
basic
issues
were
those
issues.
and
that
since
under
well-established
rules,
in
antitrust
damage
suits,
a
--
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
are
both
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
that
therefore
plaintiff
or
defendant
--
petitioner
here
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
the
complaint
to
make
this
point
was
not
a
very
lengthy
one.
it
alleged,
first,
that
--
it
alleged,
first,
that
it
was
brought
under
the
declaratory
relief
provisions
of
the
judicial
code.
as
to
page
--
at
page
10,
the
complaint
appears
in
our
record.
it
alleged,
first,
that
it
was
brought
under
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act.
it
was
entitled,
“complaint
for
declaratory
judgment”.
but
in
the
second
paragraph
of
the
complaint
after
the
first,
as
one
sentence,
there
was
alleged
that
there
was
a
controversy
in
excess
of
$3000.
and
that
the
matter
in
controversy
arises
under
the
law
of
the
united
states
to
which
sections
1
and
2
of
the
act
of
congress
of
july
2nd
entitled,
“an
act
to
protect
trade
and
commerce
against
unlawful
restraints
and
monopolies”,
commonly
known
as
the
sherman
act
and
the
section
4
of
the
act
of
october
15,
1914,
the
amendatory
thereof
commonly
known
as
the
clayton
act.
that
section
--
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
is
the
statute
which
gives
private
persons
who
are
injured,
by
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
a
right
to
sue.
it
is
the
damage
provision
of
the
antitrust
laws
relating
to
private
individuals.
so
that
in
paragraph
2,
there
is
a
rather
straightforward
statement
that
the
complaint
arises
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
under
the
section
of
the
clayton
act
which
gives
a
private
right
to
damages.
the
complaint
then
alleged
that
described
the
parties,
the
plaintiff,
fox
west
coast
theatres
corporation
as
a
company
organized
in
--
operates
in
the
neighborhood
of
150
motion
picture
theatres
primarily
on
the
west
coast.
the
defendant,
beacon
operated
the
theatre
--
opened
the
theatre,
a
drive-in
theatre
just
outside
of
san
bernardino,
california
where
fox
west
coast
had
for
many
years,
operated
a
conventional
theater
as
a
theater
with
four
walls
and
a
ceiling.
the
complaint
alleged,
then,
that
there
were
eight
major
companies
in
the
united
states
that
produced
films.
and
these
were
these
--
and
the
complaint
expressly
stated
that
they
constituted
in
the
aggregate,
this
is
at
page
13
of
the
record,
constant
in
the
aggregate,
the
major
distributors
of
motion
pictures
in
the
united
states.
thereafter,
the
complaint
alleged
that
there
had
been
a
prior
antitrust
case
between
the
government
and
these
major
suppliers
of
motion
pictures.
it
was
the
case
known
as
united
states
against
paramount
which
--
which
started
with
the
district
court,
came
to
this
court,
went
back
to
the
district
court
openly
affirmed.
it
was
then
alleged
that
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
parties.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
plaintiff,
fox
west
coast
theatres
corporation
had
for
many
years
operated
a
theatre
in
san
bernardino
on
what
was
known
as
a
first-run
in
clearance
basis.
that
is,
fox
west
coast
had
for
many
years
licensed
from
this
major
distributors,
the
privilege
or
whatever
you
will
call
it,
or
at
least
there
was
a
practice
at
that
time
to
license
to
it
a
first-run.
this
court
has
reviewed
that
problem
often.
first-run
is
the
right
to
exhibit
a
picture
exclusively
first
and
that
license
clearance.
the
clearance
is
an
agreement
that
you'll
find
in
the
cases
and
recognize
in
the
industry
as
an
agreement
between
a
distributor
of
motion
pictures
and
the
exhibitor.
the
two
parties
agree
that
during
the
time
that
that
exhibitor
will
exhibit
the
motion
picture,
that
no
other
theatre
will
be
permitted
to
exhibit
that
picture
for
a
given
period.
it's
in
the
nature,
it's
been
called,
analogized
to
the
common
law
agreements
on
not
to
compete.
that
is
analogized
to
those
cases
where
a
seller
of
a
business
selling
goodwill
agreed
with
the
buyer
that
he
would
not
compete
for
a
given
period
of
time.
the
court
will
recall
those
--
those
agreements
were
held
finally
to
be
unlawful
if
unreasonable.
that
is,
if
extended
it
too
far,
too
greater
area
or
extended
into
a
length
of
time.
they
were
analogized
--
they
have
been
analogized
by
this
court
to
those
common
law,
unreasonable
restraints
of
trade.
and
the
--
the
courts
have
held,
in
the
motion
picture
industry,
this
court
among
them,
that
such
clearances
were
lawful
if
reasonable,
unlawful
if
unreasonable.
one
aspect
of
unreasonability,
the
courts
have
held,
is
whether
the
clearance
is
granted
between
theatres
that
are
not
substantially
competitive.
again,
analogizing
it
to
the
common
law
rules.
for
if
an
agreement
by
a
seller
of
a
business
as
to
goodwill,
that
if
there
was
an
agreement
that
he
would
not
compete
within
an
area
broader
than
it
was
--
than
was
necessary,
such
agreements
were
not
enforced
because
they
were
unnecessary
and
because
they
were
basically
restraints
of
competition.
and
since
they
were
unnecessary,
they
would
not
be
enforced
by
the
courts.
for
that
they
would
then
be
unreasonable.
that
rule
of
law,
namely,
that
the
clearances
between
theatres
which
are
not
substantially
competitive
is
an--
is
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
as
a
proposition
of
law
which
i
understand
neither
party
to
contest
here
based
upon
this
court's
decisions
on
the
recognized
decisions
in
other
courts.
and
so
the
complaint
alleged
that
for
many
years,
fox
west
coast
had
operated
the
--
its
theatre
on
this
basis,
an
exclusive
running
clearance
over
theatres
in
the
area.
and
it
--
it
was
alleged
that
a
controversy
had
arisen
because
of
the
--
of
the
opening
--
because
a
theatre
--
a
new
theatre
was
about
to
come
into
existence,
namely,
petitioner's
theatre
here,
a
drive-in
theater
located
some
11
miles
from
downtown
san
bernardino.
the
allegation
was
that
the
petitioner,
beacon
theatres
made
this
contention.
it
contended
that
its
drive-in
theater
was
not
and
would
not
be
substantially
competitive
with
the
downtown
san
bernardino
theatre.
and
that
it
contended,
therefore,
that
if
any
distributor
granted
clearance,
entered
into
a
restrictive
agreement
that
i've
described,
such
a
--
such
an
agreement
would
be
unlawful
under
the
antitrust
laws.
the
complaint
alleged
that
fox,
on
the
other
hand,
took
a
contrary
position.
that
it
contended
those
two
theatres
were
not
or
were
substantially
competitive.
and
that,
therefore,
if
either
of
them
licensed,
they
first
run
and
either
of
them
obtained
an
agreement,
a
clearance
agreement,
that
such
an
agreement
would
not
be
unlawful
within
the
meaning
of
the
law.
the
complaint
there,
then
alleged
that
in
--
restated
this
proposition
in
terms
of
rights,
that
is
to
say,
it
stated
that
--
that
the
plaintiff,
fox
west
coast,
contends
that
it
had
an
equal
right
with
beacon
to
negotiate
with
each
distributor
independently
for
that
prior
running
for
a
clearances
between
the
two
theatres.
the
--
this
was
the
end
of
this
--
after
the
completion
of
this
paragraph,
there
then
was
alleged
a
paragraph
xii,
which
became
of
some
importance
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
what
i
mentioned.
it
was
alleged
in
this
--
in
the
next
paragraph
that
petitioner,
beacon
theatres
had
threatened
fox
west
coast
and
had
told
fox
that
it
--
that
it
had
threatened
the
distributors.
that
if
any
distributor
granted
clearance
between
these
two
theatres,
that
the
petitioner,
beacon,
would
file
an
antitrust
case,
a
damage
antitrust
case
against
--
against
any
distributor
who
so
did.
while
its
not
alleged,
if
you
will
recall,
that
in
the
prior
paragraph,
it
is
alleged,
but
not
in
this
paragraph
that
the
--
the
difference
of
opinion
was
as
to
whether
these
theatres
were
competitive
such
a
clearance
will
be
unlawful.
and
so
it
was
alleged
that
petitioner
told
fox
and
told
fox
that
it
had
told
the
distributors,
that
if
any
such
contract
was
entered
into,
it
would
file
a
damage
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws.
it
was
then
alleged
that
these
threats
which
it
has
alleged
in
the
complaint
were
made
to
fox
and
fox
had
been
informed
that
we
had
threatened
the
distributor.
it
was
alleged
that
these
threats
exercise
a
coercion
upon
the
distributors
and
resulted
in
the
fact
--
and
resulted
in
depriving
fox
from
obtaining
first-run
and
clearance
in
that
area.
a
complaint,
then
alleged,
to
follow.
the
plaintiff
was
without
any
speedy
or
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
will
be
irreparably
harmed
unless
and
i'm
quoting,
“defendants
and
its
officers,
agents
and
employees
are
restrained
and
enjoined
from
instituting
any
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
against
the
plaintiff
and
said
distributors
or
any
of
them
based
upon
the
facts
hereinabove
alleged,
during
the
pendency
of
this
action
and
until
such
time
as
the
court
shall
determine
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
have
an
equal
and
correlative
right
to
license
a
prior
run
with
clearance
on
behalf
of
their
respective
theatres."
this
is
the
body
of
the
complaint
in
which
the
allegation
was
made
that
--
that
unless
the
plaintiff
--
the
petitioner
here,
beacon,
is
restrained
from
suing
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws,
during
the
pendency
of
the
case
that
there
will
be
irreparable
injury.
thereafter,
the
complaint
set
forth
its
prayer,
the
prayer
is
a
fairly
simple.
the
first
one,
asked
the
court,
the
word
is
used
to
decree
that
a
grant
of
clearance
between
a
first-run
theatre
in
san
bernardino
between
the
fox
theatre
and
the
petitioner's
theatre
is
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
is
not
a
violation
of
the
decree
in
the
paramount
case.
secondly,
that
it
be
decreed
that
the
distributors
are
each
them
entitled
to
negotiate
with
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
and
other
operators
of
theaters
in
the
competitive
area
equally
for
a
prior
run
in
the
said
area.
third,
that
the
court
declares
such,
otherwise,
for
that
pending
file
decision
of
the
court
herein
defendant
beacon
and
its
theatres
and
its
officers,
agents
and
employees
be
restrained
and
enjoined
again
from
commencing
any
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
against
plaintiff
and
the
distributors
hereinabove
named
arising
out
of
the
facts
or
controversies.
this
was
the
complaint.
and
the
petitioner
here,
beacon,
when
it
made
its
demand
for
jury
trial,
in
the
trial
court,
as
to
the
complaint
took
a
very
simple
position
and
stated
that
--
that
this
was
a
complaint
for
declaratory
relief,
and
a
complaint
for
declaratory
--
in
a
complaint
for
declaratory
relief
if
the
action
is
a
substitute,
for
a
suit
at
law,
namely,
a
suit
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
--
that
the
defendant,
either
side
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
that
this
was
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
brought
under
the
section
of
the
antitrust
laws
relating
to
private
damages
and
was
not
--
and
that
therefore,
we
were
entitled
to
a
--
to
a
jury
trial.
i
might
point
out
that
it
may
not
be
an
important
point.
the
complaint
i
might
say
was
not
verified.
this
maybe
of
some
significance
because
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
provide
that
if
you
want
a
preliminary
restraining
order,
you've
got
to
verify
or
you've
got
to
put
in
an
affidavit
that
during
the
entire
pendency
of
these
proceedings,
all
the
time
the
matter
was
in
the
trial
court,
no
application
was
made
for
injunction
to
restrain
us
from
filing
the
antitrust
case
or
any
other
type
and
no
pleading,
no
papers
were
filed
which
will
sustain
such
a
--
such
a
request.
the
argument
that
we're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
this
--
on
the
complaints
standing
--
standing
alone
was
based
not
only
upon
the
--
these
allegations
which
seem
straightforward
based
upon
the
analogy
of
the
common
law,
to
the
common
law
covenants
not
to
compete,
based
--
based
also
upon
the
fact
well
known
to
these
--
to
fox
west
coast
that
these
problems
of
--
of
restraints
of
trade
by
clearances
have
long
been
litigated
in
damage
cases.
that
is
as
a
fairly
common
--
common
matter
that
appears
in
case
after
case
involving
these
--
involving
fox.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
corinblit
it
was
--
it
was
endorsed
upon
the
same
pleading,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
mr.
jack
corinblit
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
corinblit
that's
correct.
since
the
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
your
honor,
squarely.
it
was
raised
by
--
the
first
issue
was
raised
in
our
brief.
the
--
i
was
saying
that
the
--
the
matter
of
--
of
the
trial
--
of
issues
of
substantial
competition
and
clearance
had
long
for
many
years
been
part
of
the
damage
cases
brought
by
litigants
where
they
thought
they
had
a
right.
a
--
a
typical
case
in
this
connection
is
one
that
we
cited
--
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
the
case
of
j&j.
theatres,
inc.
a
second
circuit
case,
212
f.2d
840
in
which
the
--
in
that
case,
the
contention
was
by
an
individual
theatre
that
it
was
unlawfully
being
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
play
pictures
on
a
given
run
by
reason
of
unreasonable
clearances
and
clearances
over
its
theater
which
was
not
competitive.
in
that
case,
the
instruction
was
given,
as
follows,
which
is
of
some
interest
as
to
demonstrate
the
way
in
which
this
issue
arises.
if
you
find
that
this
--
there
--
there
was
substantial
competition
between
the
two
theatres,
then
plaintiff
has
failed
to
establish
the
element
of
te
prior
run
and
clearance
in
favor
of
the
park
plaza
over
the
luxor
was
unreasonable.
and
your
verdict
should
be
for
the
defendants.
that
is,
the
issue
is
one
of
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
if
there
is
a
conspiracy
to
impose
clearance
and
the
clearance
is
between
theatres
that
were
not
competitive,
you've
got
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
that
issue,
i
might
say,
goes
not
only
to
the
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
but,
of
course,
to
the
issue
of
conspiracy
itself
because,
if
a
court
were
to
conclude
or
jury
trial,
if
that
were
to
conclude,
that
these
clearances
were
unreasonable
and
that
they
were
uniformly
granted.
a
trier
of
fact
would
be
entitled
to
infer,
not
required
to
infer,
as
this
court
held,
the
theatre
enterprises
case.
but
entitled
to
infer,
that
it
was
pursuant
to
a
conspiracy
in
the
sense
that
you
can
infer
from
uniform
unreasonable
acts
in
a
business
circumstance.
to
put
the
--
the
picture
together,
a
jury
is
ordinarily
permitted
to
make
such
--
such
an
inference.
so,
that
this
issue
had
been
litigated
and
was
regularly
litigated
as
part
of
private
treble
damage
cases
in
jury
trials
and
known
by
the
plaintiff,
fox
west
coast
to
be
--
to
--
that
that
was
known
by
them.
their
company
has
been
the
defendant
in
a
number
of
antitrust
cases,
as
the
major
distributors
have,
arising
out
of
this
court's
--
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
sherman
act
as
well
as
out
of
the
paramount
case
itself.
when
in
a
--
we
made
a
demand
for
jury
trial
as
to
the
complaint
in
the
answer.
in
the
answer,
i
might
say,
we
raised
the
--
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
were
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
we
filed
an
affirmative
defense
which
said
we
thought
that
they
were
violating
the
antitrust
laws
and
then
we
filed
a
counterclaim.
it's
one
document,
the
answer
from
the
defense
in
counterclaim
and
endorsed
upon
the
document
as
request
for
jury
trial
as
to
the
complaint,
the
answer
in
the
counterclaim
is
expressed.
the
counterclaim
raised
the
antitrust
issues
and
sought
damages
as
well
as
other
conjunctive
relief.
the
proceedings
then
took
place
as
follows.
the
motion
was
filed
to
strike
our
demand
for
jury
trial
as
to
the
complaint
in
the
answer.
the
motion
was
granted.
the
motion
was
filed
to
strike
our
allegations
and
our
answer
in
affirmative
defense
that
the
defendants
were
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
this
motion
was
granted.
a
motion
was
filed
to
sever
the
complaint
for
the
counterclaim
and
to
try
the
complaint
first,
ahead
of
the
counter
claim.
and
this
motion
was
granted.
the
--
upon
these
motions,
i
--
i've
broken
them
up
but
of
course
the
motions
were
in
one
and
that
there
were
three
parts
if
i'd
describe
them
independently.
we
filed
a
--a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
based
our
request
for
mandamus
upon
this
court's
seemingly
long
line
of
opinion,
decisions
which
said
--
and
other
courts
of
appeals
including
the
ninth
circuit
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
in
jury
trial
matters,
where
a
jury
trial
has
been
denied
that
that
was
one
of
those
exceptional
issues
which
courts
of
appeals
should
hear
by
way
of
mandamus.
i
like
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
passed
upon
that
question.
that
is
when
they
ultimately
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
i
rely
primarily,
your
honor,
on
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
--
with
ex
parte
simons.
now,
i
will
submit
that
that
was
mandamus
out
of
this
court
and
not
mandamus
out
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
has
not
been
any
--
there
have
not
been
any
law
to
the
effect
that
really
makes
a
distinction
between
the
two
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
they
have
granted
mandamus
and
jury
trial.
i
have
argued
that
there
is
not
a
distinction
between
the
two.
the
point
that
i
--
i
wish
to
make
is
that
i
do
--
don't
believe
that
that
question
is
before
you
here
unless
you
conclude
that
this
is
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
there
is
no
cross-petition
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
there
is
no
issue
raised
that
there
was
--
that
the
discretion
was
abused
because
the
court
of
appeals
distinctly
refused
to
pass
upon
that.
it
went
to
the
merits
of
the
case
without
passing
upon
whether,
in
its
discretion,
it
would
or
would
not
issue
mandamus.
and
they
said
so
in
their
opinion.
and
we
didn't
raise
that
question
and
when
we
raised
our
three
questions
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
no
cross-petition
was
filed
by
the
other
side
and
if
the
matter
was
in
--
and
--
and
therefore,
no
issue
of
the
willingness
or
unwillingness
to
exercise
discretion,
is
i
believe,
before
this
court
at
this
time.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
when
we
filed,
i
might
say
an
application
for
leave
to
the
file
a
writ
of
mandamus,
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
follows
that
practice.
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
not
filed
--
followed
everywhere
but
at
least
it
is
in
the
ninth
circuit.
you
just
can't
file
automatically
and
they
--
they
considered
it
and
they
decided
we
ought
to
be
granted
a
leave.
we
were
permitted
to
file
a
petition.
and
the
respondent
judge
was
ordered
to
show
cause
why
--
why
the
petition
shouldn't
be
granted.
he
filed
a
response.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
the
--
the
statute
--
the
statute
has
been
changed
although
the
language
of
--
of
present
--
of
the
present
mandamus
statute,
i
don't
think,
changes
the
--
the
ultimate
result.
at
least
i
felt
that
la
buy
versus
howes,
although
it
was
a
subject
to
considerable
argument,
indicated
that
--
that
there
was
at
least
a
power
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
act.
but
the
question
was
to
be
one
of
discretion.
and
again,
that
issue
of
the
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion
has
not
been
brought
here
in
my
judgment
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals,
after
i
might
say,
keeping
the
matter
under
consideration
for
some
time
because
i
think
the
court
thought
it
was
an
important
question,
that
rendered
its
opinion.
and
it
--
it
denied
our
petition
for
mandamus.
what
the
court
did,
was
to
say
in
the
first
place
that
we
were
right.
if
this
complaint
had
only
been
a
complaint
for
the
declaratory
relief,
the
court
said
we
were
right.
that
is
to
say,
you
can't
in
the
complaint
for
the
court
declaratory
relief,
reverse
positions
and
destroy
the
right
of
jury
trial.
you
can't
anticipate
a
case
or
--
and
destroy
the
right
of
jury
trial
by
suing
declaratory
relief.
but
the
court
said
that
this
really
wasn't
an
action
for
declaratory
relief.
this
was
an
action
which
it
was
not
willing
to
label
"in
equity."
and
the
basis
for
the
contention
that
the
--
that
the
whole
case
was
in
--
was
in
equity
is
the
paragraph
12
in
which
the
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
no,
sir.
it
may
be
in
equity.
mr.
jack
corinblit
either
in
equity.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
held
here
that
this
action
was
in
equity
based
upon
the
allegations
of
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint.
that
is
to
say,
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner
here
threatened
fox
with
an
antitrust
case,
that
had
interfered
with
their
business.
but
the
court
went
further.
in
holding
that
was
was
in
equity,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that
the
issue
of
the
threats
alleged,
alone,
would
be
tried
by
the
court.
but
all
of
the
issues
and
the
complaint
would
be
tried
with
the
court
without
--
and
no
--
no
jury.
that
is
to
say,
the
issues
of
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade,
the
issue
of
substantial
competition
would
be
tried
by
the
court,
as
well
as
the
question
of
the
threats
and
whether
some
kind
of
an
injunction
should
be
issued.
now,
i
might
point
out
that
the
court
ignored
the
fact
that
the
only
prayer
in
the
complaint
and
the
only
substantive
allegation
in
the
complaint
asked
for
an
injunction,
pendente
lite.
there
was
never
a
single
prayer
or
a
permanent
or
any
permanent
injunctive
relief,
just
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
used
this
paragraph
of
the
complaint
and
that
prayer
unless
it
relied
on
a
general
prayer,
to
conclude
that
the
whole
case
was
thereby
in
equity.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
mr.
jack
corinblit
the
purpose
--
yes.
the
purpose
of
that
pendente
lite
injunction
would
be
to
prevent
us
from
filing
an
antitrust
case,
i
might
say.
this
is
the
prayer.
this
is
what
we
will
ask,
not
the
threats.
the
court
later
inferred
that.
but
filing
antitrust
case,
while
will
the
declaratory
relief
suit
was
being
tried?
but
what
the
court
did
was
to
say
that
the
declaratory
relief
issues
would
be
tried
to
the
court
and
not
to
the
jury
and
hang
--
hung
its
hat
on
the
proposition
that
the
--
that
the
substantive
allegation
in
that
prayer
made
it
a
case
in
equity
which
--
which
deprived
us,
which
was
permitted
to
deprive
us
of
the
right
of
jury
trial.
mr.
jack
corinblit
as
in
equity
case.
but,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
court
was
if
you
please
--
here
characterizing
the
whole
complaint
by
reason
of
this
pendente
lite
request
because
this
is
all
the
court
of
appeals
used
to
find
that
this
was
an
action
in
equity.
this
pendente
lite
request
in
the
--
in
the
substantive
paragraph
and
in
the
prayer.
the
--
we
submit,
of
course,
that
the
court's
action
in
finding
that
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
or
allegations
of
declaratory
relief,
which
are
substituted
allegations
for
a
suit
at
law,
namely,
suit
for
damages.
that
such
an
action
is
converted
into
an
action
in
equity
and
all
of
the
issues
to
be
tried
in
equity
by
reason
of
an
allegation
of
threats
of
litigation
is
not
sound,
is
contrary
to
this
court's
rules
and
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
federal
rules
in
uniting
law
and
equity.
we
say
it
is
not
sound
historically.
historically,
the
courts
were
always
very
careful
to
see
to
it
that
a
complainant
did
not
blend
issues
at
law
and
issues
in
equity,
possibly
in
equity,
in
the
same
complaint
and
thereby
eliminate
the
right
of
jury
trial.
a
case
which
--
which
makes
this
statement
directly
is
the
case
of
scott
versus
neely
which
we
cited
in
which
the
court
there,
in
that
case,
mississippi
had
decided
that
you
could
sue
in
the
state
court
in
equity
and
become
a
creditor
and
get
a
lien
executed
on
at
the
same
time.
and
you
do
all
that
in
equity.
and
a
plaintiff
tried
to
accomplish
that
result
in
the
federal
court.
and
the
federal
court
said,
“they
may
do
that
in
the
mississippi
state
courts
but
the
seventh
amendment
binds
us
here
as
--
and
--and
we
cannot
do
it
and
they
said
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
if
i
can
finally
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
it's
--
it's
in
the
reply
--
in
the
reply,
your
honor.
i
beg
your
pardon.
scott
versus
neely,
140
u.s.
106.
and
the
court
in
that
case
said,
“in
the
federal
courts,
this
right
--
right
of
trial
by
a
jury
cannot
be
dispensed
with
except
by
the
assent
of
parties
entitled
to
it
nor
can
it
be
impaired
by
any
blending
with
the
claim
properly
cognizable
of
law
of
a
demand
for
equitable
relief
in
aid
of
a
legal
action
or
during
its
pendency.”
now,
of
course,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
has
been
designed
precisely
to
blend,
that
is,
in
the
sense
of
giving
a
litigant
the
right
and
the
obligation
to
bring
all
his
claims
in
at
the
same
time.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
uniting
the
rules
under
the
federal
rules
was
to
--to
encourage
that,
to
get
it
all
settled
at
one
time.
and
so,
whether
you
got
an
action
at
law
or
equity,
you
bring
it
in.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
don't,
you're
barred.
but,
when
this
court
--
when
congress
passed
the
enabling
statute
which
sure
led
to
the
adoption
of
this
rule,
congress
said
that
in
adopting
these
rules,
you
shall
not
incur
the
right
of
trial
by
a
jury.
and
of
course,
rule
38
said
the
same
thing.
and
there
was
never
any
intent
indicated
by
any
decision
of
this
court
that
the
mere
adaption
of
the
rule
which
now
permits
a
litigant
to
bring
actions
of
law
and
actions
of
equity,
at
the
same
time,
to
destroy
the
right
of
jury
trial.
so,
that
if
blending
couldn't
be
permitted
to
destroy
the
right
of
jury
trial
prior
to
the
rules,
surely,
it
is
not
permitted
to
destroy
the
right
of
jury
trial
under
the
rules.
and
the
interpretation
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
had
that
result
because,
looked
at
correctly
in
a
sense,
it
can
be
--
if
you're
going
to
argue
that
there's
any
equitable
features
at
all
in
this
complaint,
properly
construed.
that
--
that
pendente
lite
to
equitable
request
will
--
will
be
permitted
to
result
in
holding
that
all
of
the
issues
are
to
be
tried
with
the
court
and
not
with
the
jury.
but
if
this
rule
were
adopted,
that
it
would
be
a
serious
--
have
serious
effect
upon
--
upon
all
litigants
in
the
federal
courts.
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
would
have
become
a
trap.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
you
clarified
it,
sir.
with
respect
--
of
course,
we
think
that
looked
at,
the
complaint
correctly
and
often
times,
when
these
complaints
are
filed
and
deciding
whether
there's
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
there
is
a
question
of
history
to
be
analyzed.
what
is
this
complaint
like?
what
would
there
have
been
prior
to
the
rules?
we
urged
in
our
brief
and
we
think
it's
--
it's
sound
that
--
that
really
this
--
this
complaint
without
the
prayer
for
a
moment,
states
no
action
for
--
for
equitable
relief
at
all.
that
it's
nothing
but
an
action
for
declaratory
relief.
and
that
paragraph
12
does
not
have
the
result
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
had.
mr.
jack
corinblit
none
--
none
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
mr.
jack
corinblit
there
was
an
--
a
statement
of
irreparable
injury,
an
allegation
made
of
irreparable
injury.
mr.
jack
corinblit
if
the
suit
should
be
allowed
to
be
made.
mr.
jack
corinblit
no,
sir.
not
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
mr.
jack
corinblit
they
did.
mr.
jack
corinblit
the
factual
question
as
to
whether
there
is
competition
between
theatres
and
as
to
whether
there
is
unreasonable
clearance,
is
in
my
judgment
a
jury
question.
mr.
jack
corinblit
none
at
all.
mr.
jack
corinblit
the
--
i
was
saying
that
--
that
you
could
--
it
--
it
seemed
to
me
as
a
classical
matter
here
that
this
complaint,
in
no
way,
with
substantive
allegations,
even
alleged
a
proper
suit
in
equity.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
mr.
jack
corinblit
you
have
the
name
right
and
my
understanding
was
that
quia
timet
or
quia
timet
whichever
it
is
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
--
is
--
was
traditionally
had
to
do
with
real
property.
and
i
must
say
that
--
that
this
is,
as
about
as
much
as
i
know,
about
--
about
quia
timet,
sir.
but
i
will
say
this,
your
honor.
that
with
respect
to
the
usual,
to
the
attempt
in
this
complaint
to
use
the
fact
that
we
had
warned
somebody,
they
--
they
called
a
threat.
we
can't
do
anything
about
it.
it's
in
their
complaint.
but
that
we
had
warned
somebody
that
we
thought
that
what
they
were
going
to
do,
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
it
has
been
the
rule
and
was
the
rule
at
the
--
almost
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
that
that
kind
of
--
an
assertion
could
never
form
the
basis
of
an
action
in
equity
unless
it
was
asserted.
that
the
man
who
made
that
claim
was
doing
it
in
bad
faith
and
was
unwilling
to
test
his
right
in
court.
these
are
cases
which
i'm
sure,
your
honors,
you're
all
familiar
with.
there
--
it
was
--
there
was
a
long
bitter
battle
over
the
question
as
to
whether
equity
could
even
do
it
--
could
even
enjoin
the
second
situation.
that
is,
where
there
was
bad
faith,
but
no
court
that
--
that
no
court
had
held.
that
unless
that
you
could
have
a
--
a
case
in
equity,
unless
you
made
that
allegation
in
that
assertion
because
it
was
fundamental.
the
argument
was
in
the
case,
one
case
came
to
this
court
that
if
you've
got
a
right
to
file
under
the
antitrust
laws,
you
have
a
right
to
--
to
warn
somebody
of
your
rights
and
that
that
warning
by
itself
is
not
the
grounds
for
--
for
an
injunction.
that
what
makes
--
what
may
turn
that
into
a
case,
is
if
you're
doing
it
simply.
you're
warning
and
then
pulling
back,
you're
warning
and
pulling
back
and
refusing
that
--
to
have
that
right
tested.
but
this
case,
the
complaint
on
its
face
demonstrates
that
we,
that
if
the
petitioner
here
was
anxious
to
have
the
matter
litigated.
not
only
does
it
fail
to
allege
these
facts
that
are
simply
described,
but
the
--
but
the
contrary
is
directly
shown
because
the
allegation
is,
that
the
petitioner
has
threatened
an
antitrust
case
and
fox
west
coast
wants
to
keep
us
from
filing
an
antitrust
case
by
way
of
an
injunction.
and
they
say
they'll
be
hurt
by
the
filing
of
the
antitrust
case,
unless
we're
enjoined.
mr.
jack
corinblit
that
is
the
complaint,
your
honor.
you've
got
to
understand
that
this
was
set
up
in
the
fox's
complaint.
they
were
describing
what
we
were
alleged
to
have
done.
and
as
they
described
it,
they're
in
your
words,
that
--
that
is
to
say
that
if
they
did
what
we
thought
was
unlawful,
we
would
sue
under
the
antitrust
laws
for
damages.
mr.
jack
corinblit
no,
sir.
we
do
not
contend
that
these
alleged
warnings
were
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
go
in
to
a
court
for
declaratory
judgment.
we
think
now,
that
this
is
what
declaratory
judgment
is
for
and
that
paragraph
12
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
declaratory
relief
action.
but
doing
that,
we
say,
we're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
jack
corinblit
that's
correct.
this
is
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
and
that's
--
that's
the
theory
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
mr.
jack
corinblit
well,
i
--
this
is
an
inference.
this
is
--
is
what
you've
got
to
do
to
infer.
you've
got
to
say
that
the
threat
has
been
made
and
they
want
to
enjoin
us
from
suing.
now,
the
--
the
same
paragraph
has
the
allegation
that
they
wanted
to
enjoin
us
from
suing.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
it
--
it
does
so
allege.
i
would
come
back
to
that
point
again
on
analogizing
this
to
the
historical
case
that
it
was
always
true
that
if
you
warn
the
man
of
the
rights
that
you
honestly
believe
you
had,
and
i
might
say
this
complaint
by
alleging
the
dispute,
certainly
sets
up
that
there
is
a
dispute
in
good
faith.
there's
not
single
word
in
this
allegation
that
suggest
that
there's
any
bad
faith
on
either
side
with
regard
to
the
declaratory
relief
allegation.
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
make
that
kind
of
a
warning
in
good
faith,
that
that
may
have
some
effect
upon
the
supplier.
remember,
if
the
court
please,
that
these
suppliers
whom
they
described
are
our
suppliers
as
well
as
fox's
suppliers.
the
allegation
is
made
on
the
complaint
that
they
have
the
pictures.
they
--
we
must
go
to
them
for
supply
of
pictures
as
well
as
fox
west
coast.
and
so
that
when
we
made
the
alleged
--
the
alleged
warning,
the
alleged
warning
might
have
had
that
effect.
but
again,
there's
no
allegation
of
bad
faith,
no
allegation
that
we
are
unwilling
to
test
our
right
in
court.
and
we
suggest
that
under
the
cases
and
under
the
general
analysis
that
these
--
these
warnings
were
sufficient
to
permit
fox
to
--
to
require
us
to
test
our
claim
in
a
court.
but
they
were
not
sufficient
to
destroy
our
right
of
jury
trial
because
the
substantive
issue
was
the
same.
were
--
was
there
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
was
there
a
clearance
between
theatres
which
were
not
competitive.
was
there
unreasonable
clearance?
mr.
jack
corinblit
that
would
be
a
--
that
would
be
a
paramount
issue.
although,
your
honor,
the
issue
of
unreasonable
clearance
is,
stated
is,
sometimes
somewhat
broader
than
merely
the
question
of
competition.
that
there
are
other
factors
of
some
kind.
but
i
think
this
complaint
primarily
emphasizes
the
matter
of
substantial
competition
between
the
parties.
that
this
was
an
issue
triable
--
triable
at
law.
and
i'm
arriving
to
a
conclusion
that
if
their
--
if
there
isn't
substantial
competition,
clearance
would
be
unlawful.
if
there's
--
if
there
were
no
substantial
competition,
clearance
would
be
unlawful
under
the
cases.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
this
is
our
--
this
is
our
contention.
mr.
jack
corinblit
well,
the
--
again
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
in
duress
and
coercion
which
is
stated
by
way
of
a
conclusion
in
which,
of
course,
no
facts
are
alleged
other
than
the
mere
making
of
the
statements,
your
honor
please.
we
submit
(a),
without
the
affirmative
allegation
of
facts
showing
that
they
were
in
bad
--
that
there
was
bad
faith.
you
cannot,
we
say,
obtain
an
action
in
equity
but
--
and
without
these
affirmative
allegations.
historically,
you
never
could.
and
the
courts
were
even
concerned
that
you
could
even
do
it
then.
there
were
cases
that
held
you
couldn't
do
it
even
if
there
was
bad
faith
there.
the
courts
were
worried
of
whether
--
whether
equity
was
destroying
the
right
of
jury
trials.
but
always,
there
had
to
be
affirmative
positive
of
allegations
of
fact.
and
i
know
of
no
case
which
has
ever
permitted
an
implication
to
be
drawn
from
the
conclusion
and
resulting
in
the
right
of
jury
trial
being
lost.
but,
and
again
we
come
back
to
the
secondary
point.
that
even
if
you
grant
that,
if
you
give
them
the
benefit
of
every
doubt,
that
there
is
something
in
equity
there,
this
had
never
have
been
the
basis
for
deciding
that
the
substantive
questions
are
not
to
be
decided
by
a
jury.
even
if
the
court
will
want
to
decide
the
question
of
bad
faith,
if
there
is
such
in
--
with
respect
to
the
injunction
by
the
court.
again,
relating
to
the
fact
that
our
rules
don't
mean
that
you
have
to
--
that
it
is
all
or
nothing.
some
matters
can
be
decided
but
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
corinblit
that's
what
it
--
and
you
said
it
as
--
a
lot
better
than
i
could.
mr.
jack
corinblit
we
do
put
it
--
someone
to
counterclaim,
your
honor.
it's
a
kind
of
a
third
line
of
defense
in
this
case.
that
is
to
say,
we
--
we
argue
and
it
is
i
concede
a
--
a
little
more
difficult
problem.
let's
assume
that
the
whole
complain
is
an
equity.
let's
assume
that
our
counterclaims
at
law
and
let's
assume
that
there
are
common
issues
involved
in
the
complaint
and
the
counterclaim.
that's
the
only
way
in
which
the
counterclaim
becomes
a
material.
we
say
if
you
sue
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jack
corinblit
it
would
then
be
material
in
that
--
we
say
that
in
--
that
a
suit
in
equity
in
anticipation
of
a
suit
at
law
which
raises
common
issues
requires
under
the
federal
rules
of
that
the
court
procedure
in
such
a
manner
as
to
protect
our
right
of
--
to
jury
trial.
if
i
anticipate
that
you
are
about
to
sue
at
law
and
i
sue
in
equity
and
i
stated
merely
a
good
claim
in
equity
i
--
i
put
my
pleading
in
--
in
shipshape
order,
and
then
the
counterclaim
is
filed
at
law
that
under
--
in
that
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jack
corinblit
our
counterclaim
is
for
damages
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
do
attach
a
request
for
injunction,
as
well.
but,
it
is
primarily
a
complaint
for
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
triable
as
of
right
to
a
jury.
and
we
contend
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
well,
we
are
asking
your
honor,
we
would
of
course
ask
you
to
take
the
--
the
question
if
you
--
if
you
rule
with
us
on
the
first
portion
of
it,
we
have
no
desire
to
have
your
rule
upon
the
latter.
but,
i
must
say
that
each
of
those
questions
was
raised
by
our
petition
for
certiorari?that
all
three
of
the
questions
are
avoided.
mr.
jack
corinblit
duty
of
the
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
duty
of
the
jury
to
raise
--
duty
of
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
we
did
raise
it
by
our
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honor.
we
--
i'm
not
--
these
are
alternative
points.
each
of
them
is
raised
by
the
petitioner.
i
have
to
concede
that
we
did
raise
it
as
we
came
--
came
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
raised
it
here.
mr.
jack
corinblit
no,
sir.
i
will
not
abandon
it.
i
--
i
think
their
proposition
is
sound.
where
the
equity
suit
is
--
is
in
anticipation
of
a
suit
at
law,
that
you
cannot
anticipate
a
suit
at
law
and
substitute
a
suit
in
equity.
and
thereby
deprive
a
litigant
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
that
here,
the
anticipation
is
evidenced
by
the
very
complaint
itself
wherein
it
is
stated
that
we
warned
of
the
filing
with
antitrust
case
and
they
want
to
enjoin
us
from
the
filing
of
antitrust
case.
and
that
therefore,
since
there
are
common
issues
in
the
--
in
the
complaint
and
counterclaim,
we're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
what
are
those
common
issues?
they're
precisely
the
same
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
complaint.
there's
a
question
of
competition,
the
question
of
clearance
which
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
counterclaim.
as
i
pointed
out
before,
the
--
the
--
those
issues
have
been
tried
regularly
under
a
plaintiff's
--
in
plaintiff's
cases
under
the
antitrust
laws.
they
go
to
the
question
of
the
unreasonability
of
the
restraint.
they
go
to
the
question
of
conspiracy
because
if
you
find
that
there
is
uniform
adoption
of
an
unreasonable
way
of
doing
business,
surely
with
other
facts,
a
jury
is
permitted,
not
required,
but
permitted
to
infer
conspiracy.
and
therefore,
those
issues
are
common
to
our
counterclaim.
and
therefore,
on
that
basis,
we
urge
that
the
federal
rules
mean
that
if
you
had
that
--
that
anticipatory
filing
of
an
equity
case
raising
issues
common
with
the
counterclaim
requires
jury
trial
and
the
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
in
that
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
ordinarily,
it
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
--
it
happens
sometimes.
there's
been
a
couple
of
patent
cases
are
jury
cases
on
the
west
coast.
but,
in
those
cases
where
a
counterclaim
would
be
for
--
for
a
--
by
the
patentee
he
would
counterclaim
for
damages
for
an
infringement,
the
right
to
jury
trial
would
exist
and
it
would
be
that
patent.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
yes,
it
was.
on
this
last
third
portion
of
--
of
our
argument.
mr.
jack
corinblit
alleged
infringer.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
corinblit
no,
sir.
we
did
not
--
we
did
not
cite
the
cases.
and
i
have
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
the
basis
is
that
--
that
if
the
pleading
show
anticipation
that
this
is
being
--
the
equity
is
being
made
use
of
as
a
technique
for
avoiding
what
would
otherwise
be
--
be
a
trial
--
be
a
trial
at
law.
and
that's
--
and
a
theory
for
example,
some
of
the
insurance
cases
which
have
held,
the
cases
in
which
an
insurance
company
anticipating
a
suit
on
the
policy
wants
to
set
it
aside
for
fraud
and
they
sue
in
rescission
in
equity.
and
the
courts
say
that
if
a
counterclaim
is
imminent,
not
only
filed,
but
imminent,
the
court,
the
usual
way
of
handling
it
in
the
past
was,
of
course,
even
to
dismiss
the
cause
of
action
in
equity
on
the
grounds
that
the
--
that
the
legal
remedy
--
that
the
legal
remedy
was
adequate.
mr.
jack
corinblit
i
think
they
are
cited
in
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
mr.
jack
corinblit
enelow,
your
honor.
your
honor
will
find
it's
cited
in
our
brief
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
sir.
i
think
we've
cited
that
was
--
cited
enelow,
specifically.
that's
at
page
31
of
our
brief.
and
i
think
we
cite
the
leading
case
on
that
subject
the
(inaudible),
a
very
important
case
on
the
subject.
i
think
would
like
to
leave
sometime
for
reply
and
therefore
will
cease
at
this
point.
mr.
jack
corinblit
your
honors,
just
briefly,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
two
questions,
briefly.
first,
i
think
on
the
question
of
our
right
to
jury
trial
on
the
complaint
standing
alone.
it's
clear
that
the
counsel
stands
on
the
right
in
a
court
trial
of
all
of
the
issues
upon
only
upon
the
grounds
that
they
pray
for
a
injunction
pendente
lite
against
the
filing
of
antitrust
case.
and
i
submit
that
the
tail
cannot
wag
the
dog
in
that
way.
you
cannot
characterize
a
--
a
complaint
entirely
as
an
equitable
manner
by
an
allegation
of
pendente
lite
relief
or
pendente
lite
relief.
secondly,
on
the
question
of
the
relationship
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
to
the
counterclaim,
we
allege
that
there
was
a
--
one
of
the
elements
of
the
conspiracy
was
a
conspiracy
to
grant
clearance
between
these
theatres.
if
there
were
no
substantial
competition
between
those
two
theatres,
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
and
on
that
fact,
a
prior
decision
by
the
court
will
be
res
judicata
on
the
counterclaim
and
will
be
vital
to
the
allegation
and
the
proof
of
the
counterclaim.
it
is
not
the
only
issue
and
we
can
see
it,
it
isn't
the
only
issue.
there
are
other
grounds
for
relief
or
the
basis
of
this
--
and
other
acts
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
which
were
alleged.
but
it
is
an
important
one
and
an
essential
one
with
respect
to
the
proof
in
this
case.
and
finally,
with
--
with
respect
to
the
question
raised
about,
as
to
mandamus,
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
harlan
so
that
this
matter
can
only
considered
by
you
in
a
mandamus
question
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
power.
mr.
jack
corinblit
i
--
i
realize
that.
and
i
think
that
on
the
question
of
power,
that
the
court
has
in
the
past
on
the
formula
adopted,
agreed
that
mandamus
of
--
there
was
a
power
of
mandamus
with
the
matter
of
jury
trial
--
is
involved.
i'm
going
to
--
i'd
say
this
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes?
mr.
jack
corinblit
to
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
to
--
to
issue
on
a
writ
out
of
this
court
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
--
in
the
same
grounds
that
you
could
issue
a
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
--
writ
out
of
if
--
out
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jack
corinblit
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
corinblit
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
yes,
your
honor
there
has.
and
that
is
in
the
particular
--
i
think
in
both
the
second
and
the
sixth
circuits,
a
mandamus
have
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
well,
i
was
thinking
of
bereslavsky,
there
--
bereslavsky
versus
kloeb.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
plaintiff
was
involved
in
two
circuits
apparently,
and
both
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes.
but
in
both
cases,
both
circuits
agreed
and
they
reviewed
your
opinions
here.
i
think
mr.
justice
--
judge
frank
reviewed
your
opinions
and
he
concluded
that
the
new
statute
did
not
make
any
change
and
that
the
cases
were
still
applicable
because
in
a
subsequent
opinion,
after
the
new
statute
was
adopted,
one
of
you,
i
--
i
believe
it
was
--
i
don't
recall
the
name
of
it,
you'll
find
it
in
bereslavsky
versus
kloeb
or
versus
caffey,
in
that
case,
that
you
have
referred
to
the
fact
the
jury
trial
was
one
of
those
exceptional
cases
in
which
mandamus
was
--
was
--
permissible.
and
the
cases
begin
--
there
are
a
long
line
of
them.
and
certainly
in
the
light
of
this
court's
opinion,
last
term
in
la
buy,
the
power
is
a
--
is
--
should
--
should
exist
here
and
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
no.
no,
it's
in
--
in
a
construction
of
--
in
aid
of
jurisdiction,
1651.
mr.
jack
corinblit
the
argument
is
made
that
--
that
when
a
trial
court
refuses
to
hear
a
--
hear
a
case
in
the
way
that
is
in
the
form
before
the
trier
of
fact,
that
it
is
proceeding
in
a
way
which
is
--
which
is
in
a
sense
outside
of
its
jurisdiction.
and
therefore
falls
with
those
cases
that
hold
you
may
correct
jurisdictional
defects
in
the
trial
court
by
mandamus.
mr.
jack
corinblit
it
is
hard
to
think
of
that.
i
concede
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
--
but
i
say
only
that
the
record
as
of
--
of
your
decisions,
this
court's
decision
to
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
sustain
the
--
sustain
the
power
of
the
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jack
corinblit
yes,
that's
one
of
the
cases
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
i
think
you
--
in
a
--
under
the
all
writs
statute,
you
made
a
reference
in
a
--
in
a
long
list
of
cases
you
said
the
jury
trial
is
one
of
those
cases,
isn't
it?
except
--
mr.
jack
corinblit
no.
there
is
--
it's
a
case
prior
--
prior
to
la
buy.
thank
you.
