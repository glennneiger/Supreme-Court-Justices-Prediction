(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
about
the
first
paragraph
in
section
6
(inaudible)
that
has
to
do
with
the
clayton
act,
doesn't
it?but
what
i
want
to
find
out
is
if
it
was
determined
in
your
suit
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
competition
between
you
and
the
issue
here,
would
that
bar
the
res
judicata
on
this
suit
on
number
1,
on
page
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
of
the
clayton
act?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
has
to
do
with
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
(inaudible)
under
the
counterclaim.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
where
a
conspiracy
would
be
the
counterclaim,
it
goes
through
the
whole
claim
and
then
these
specific
items
over
that
comes
the
conspiracy
of
one
being
a
threat.
and
that
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
there's
competition.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
would
be
determined
in
your
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand,
not
clearance.
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
be
determined
that
--
that
was
an
area
in
which
clearance
was
in
line
with
legally,
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
go
ahead.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
don't
you
think
that
would
have
some
effect
on
this
case
even
though
he
had
--
you,
of
course
has
to
prove
the
conspiracy?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
he
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
the
case
construed
at
the
section
1
that
there
was
conspiracy
to
--
to
create
the
first-runs
in
(inaudible)
which
would
not
be
your
case.
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
it's
so,
there
is
no
competition
here
in
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
know
of
any
case
which
have
been
filed
like
the
pittsburg
theatre?
