i
suppose
--
i
suppose
counsel
that
if
the
issue
of
competition
was
resolved
against
you,
that
is,
that
there
is
--
there
was
a
finding
of
competition
that
was
settled
in
the
lawsuit,
wouldn't
it,
on
the
paramount
case?
or
if
there's
a
finding
that
there
was
no
competition,
it
would
settle
it
the
other
way,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
i'm
getting
at
and
perhaps
you
don't
want
to
answer
it
at
this
time,
but
sometime
i'd
like
to
have
your
views
on
it.
suppose
that
the
--
just
a
general
denial
had
been
entered
here,
to
this
complaint,
would
or
would
not
be,
the
parties,
they
would
go
to
trial
on
--
before
a
jury
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action?
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
there
was
competition.
