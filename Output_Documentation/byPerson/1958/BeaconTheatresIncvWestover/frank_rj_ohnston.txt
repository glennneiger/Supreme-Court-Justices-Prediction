mr.
frank
r.j.
ohnston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
at
the
outset
that
the
complaint
which
is
here
for
construction
by
the
court
is
not
a
model
of
pleading
as
--
as
observed
by
judge
pope
in
the
court
below.
however,
i
think
viewed
fairly
and
liberally
as
pleadings
must
be
viewed
now,
it
does
state
a
cause
for
equitable
relief
and
states
it
clearly.
now,
i
would
like
to
correct
one
misapprehension
that
may
have
been
created,
by
my
friend,
mr.
cornblit.
and
that
is
this,
in
the
complaint,
we
sought
not
an
award
of
first-run
by
the
distributors
but
the
right
to
negotiate
for
first-run
with
clearance,
equally
with,
mr.
cornblit's
client,
free
of
threats
and
duress.
we
couldn't
demand
that
any
distributor
give
us
a
first-run.
all
we
seek
--
all
we
ask
for
here
is
the
right
to
not
have
the
door
shut
in
our
face.
that
is
the
extent
of
the
remedies
sought.
now,
i
have
a
minute
perhaps
in
which
i
can
answer
mr.
justice
black's
inquiry
of
mr.
cornblit
as
to
whether,
and
i
maybe
paraphrasing,
traditional
equitable
allegations
are
made
here.
i
will
refer
to
page
18
of
the
record,
paragraph
12
of
our
complaint
and
after
having
alleged
that
if
clearance
is
granted,
a
treble
damage
action
will
be
filed,
we
say
further
that
said
threats
and
the
duress
and
coercion
upon
the
distributors
arising
out
of
and
resulting
from
said
threats
of
litigation,
threaten
to
and
have
in
fact
deprived
plaintiff
and
its
said
california
theatre
of
the
right
to
negotiate
for
motion
pictures
upon
their
first-run
in
the
san
bernardino
area
and
to
negotiate
for
clearance
over
theatres
in
competition
with
plaintiff's
said
theatre
upon
said
first-run
including
defendants
bel-air
drive-in
theatre.
then
i
come
to
this
which
is
a
traditional
and
conventional
allegation
in
suits
of
equity,
that
plaintiff
is
without
any
speedy
or
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
will
be
irreparably
harmed
--
