versus
the
honorable
harry
c.
westover,
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
california,
et
al.
mr.
corinblit,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnston.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnston,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
addition
to
that
one
point,
you
did
also
ask
for
an
injunction,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
--
to
the
argument
of
counsel
that
you
did
not
follow
the
rules
concerning
injunction
that
you
neither
--
neither
verified
your
complaint
nor
filed
an
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
good.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
split
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
johnston,
one
of
the
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
crosses
my
mind
is
this.
if
your
--
if
your
complaint
did
not
have
in
mind
that
the
threat
included
the
possibility
of
them
filing
an
antitrust
case,
why
--
why
did
you
ask
in
number
4
the
pending
final
decision
of
the
court
maybe
restrained
and
enjoined
from
commencing
an
action
under
the
antitrust
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
there
had
been
no
threat
but
merely
the
filing
of
a
suit,
would
you
sought
to
restrain
them
from
proceeding
with
that
suit
until
--
until
you
could
do
that
in
adjudication
on
this
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
let's
take
the
very
--
the
very
pleading
that
we
have
here
the
custom
of
the
counterclaim.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wouldn't
they
then
be
deprived
to
the
--
to
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
determine
these
issues
first?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
if
you're
--
if
you
prevailed
on
your
--
your
number
4,
paragraph
4
in
your
--
in
your
complaint
and
they
had
been
restrained
from
filing
such
a
damage
suit,
you
--
you
would've
effectively
blocked
them
from
having
such
cause
of
action,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
pardon
me.
i'm
just
going
to
ask,
was
that
all
you
wanted?
didn't
you
seek
permanent
relief
against
--
against
them
finding
an
antitrust
suit
against
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
did
pursue
that
and
asked
for
it
to
and
find
the
judgment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
where
i'm
confused
is
if
you
had
been
granted
all
the
relief
that
you
sought
in
your
complaint,
would
these
people
have
been
--
had
available
to
them
a
legal
action
for
--
for
damages
for
the
things
they
claimed
in
their
counterclaim?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
go
right
ahead,
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnston,
if
the
trial
judge
had
accepted
all
the
allegations
in
paragraph
12
of
your
complaint
and
had
granted
the
injunction
pendente
lite
at
the
outset
of
the
proceeding,
is
there
any
reason
why
the
remainder
of
the
fact
should
not
be
tried
to
a
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
he
granted
you
the
equitable
relief
that
you
sought
through
the
injunction
pendente
lite,
would
--
is
there
any
reason
thereafter
why
the
--
the
facts,
both
of
your
complaint
and
on
the
--
on
the
counterclaim
should
not
be
tried
through
a
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
the
procedure
that
the
judge
adopted
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
elaborate
that
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
yes,
i
--
i
get
your
point.
you
don't
need
to
answer
the
question,
i
--
i
recalled.
but
they
would
--
but
if
to
take
the
case
in
its
present
posture,
there
would
be
some
things
that
would
be
res
judicata
at
the
time
they
got
to
a
jury,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
--
if
i
can
ask
just
one
more
question.
i'll
try
not
to
bother
you
anymore.
but
suppose
these
people
didn't
answer
at
all
and
you
took
a
judgment
against
them
on
your
complaint.
and
thereafter,
they
filed
a
suit
against
you
under
section
4
of
the
--
of
the
clayton
act,
to
what
extent
would
the
defendant
be
bound
by
res
judicata
in
that
action?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
--
let's
--
let's
say
that
he
--
he
tried
the
same
theory
that
he
tried
in
the
--
in
the
counterclaim
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
a
question
of
competition
a
legal
or
an
equitable
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
a
question
of
law
or
is
it
an
equitable
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
under
--
under
the
decisions,
is
that
the
type
of
question
that
is
normally
left
to
a
jury
or
is
it
to
be
--
or
--
or
can
it
be
arrogated
to
the
court
in
an
equity
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
--
mr.
corinblit,
you
may
--
