justice
potter
stewart
hasn't
the
statute
been
changed
since
this
court
decided
ex
parte
simons?
justice
potter
stewart
you
refer,
mr.
corinblit,
to
the
necessity
sometimes
of
making
a
historical
analysis
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
as
i
think
it
would
--
i'd
certainly
agree
with
that
necessity.
what
is
lacking
here
from
a
traditional
equitable
suit
what
they
called
quia
timet?
i
have
the
name
right?
i
think
i
do.
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
you
pronounce
it
your
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
doesn't
paragraph
12
allege
that
their
very
threats
of
filing
a
suit
--
that
your
very
threats
of
file
--
of
filing
a
suit
has
in
fact
deprived
them
of
their
right
to
negotiate
on
a
first-run
clearance
basis
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
the
distributors.
and
certainly,
if
that's
true
and
it's
understandable
how
that
could
be
true.
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
you
to
file
any
law
suit
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
--
to
deprive
them
of
their
right
that
they're
asserting
isn't
that
true?
just
to
--
the
--
the
mere
threat
of
it
could
succeed.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
that
it
--
that
it
alleges
there
that
the
threat
to
sue
has
operated
to
deprive
them
of
a
right
to
their
suit?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
find
this
in
a
similar
situation
quite
frequently
in
the
patent
field
where
--
where
an
alleged
infringer
will
bring
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
for
declaration
that
he's
not
infringing?
alleging
that
the
patentee
is
threatening
to
sue
for
infringement?
i
suppose
the
answer
--
the
reason
we
haven't
had
this
problem
arise,
the
stricter
problem
is
that
neither
side
wants
a
jury
trial
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
those
patent
cases
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
would
be
in
theory
if
not
in
practical
effect
very
similar
to
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
generally
no
declaratory
judgment
action
ever
prays
for
monetary
damages,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
ask
for
a
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
pittsburg
theatre,
isn't
that
--
is
that
man
could
recover
and
could
perhaps
show
in
the
allegation.
justice
potter
stewart
a
conspiracy
to
give
first-runs
to
san
bernardino.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
theatre
near
pittsburg,
(inaudible)
and
so
on.
that
if
you
gave
him
what
you
gave
the
san
bernardino
theatres,
i
would
make
much
more
money
than
i'm
making,
(inaudible)
no
competition
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
theatre
were
not
in
substantial
competition
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
each
other
for
the
same
audience?
justice
potter
stewart
a
conspiracy
as
of
the
kind
alleged
in
the
counterclaim.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
relying
generally
on
the
proposition
that
if
the
--
if
the
court
is
right,
even
if
for
the
wrong
reason,
then
its
action
should
be
affirmed,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
in
this
--
on
this
(inaudible)
case?
justice
potter
stewart
or
discretionary
over
court.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
corinblit
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
to
that
point,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
factually
on
this.
as
i
understand
it
now,
this
court
has
the
same
power
that
the
--
that
any
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
so
far
as
the
statute
goes.
the
same
statute
governs
both
the
courts
of
appeals
and
this
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
all
--
the
all
writs
act,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
statute
covers
each
--
each
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
one
case
is
like
the
simmons
case
and
the
roche
case
and
others
were
decided.
a
different
statute
governed
this
court's
power
from
the
one
that
governed
the
court
of
appeals'
power.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
--
has
there
been
any
case
under
the
all
writs
statute,
either
here
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
a
mandamus
is
issued
in
a
situation
like
this
to
where
there
was
a
--
where
the
--
where
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
what
case
is
this
sixth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
at
this
point,
i'm
sorry
to
waste
much
of
your
time.
this
court
has
never
decided
that
under
the
all
writs
statute,
mandamus
is
appropriate
in
this
field.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
