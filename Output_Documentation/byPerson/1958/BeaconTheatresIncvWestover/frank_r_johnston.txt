mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess
i
was
in
the
middle
of
reading
from
the
complaint
in
trying
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
an
equitable
issue
posed
by
the
complaint
which
could
not,
under
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
be
determined
if
in
an
action
of
law.
and
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
i'll
resume
reading
at
the
first
of
the
sentence,
i
have
started
thusly.
and
i'm
reading
from
page
18
again
of
the
record.
“that
said
threats
and
the
duress
in
coercion
upon
the
distributors
arising
out
of
and
resulting
from
said
threats
of
litigation,
threaten
to
and
have,
in
fact,
deprived
plaintiff
and
its
said
california
theatre
of
the
right
to
negotiate
for
motion
pictures
upon
their
first-run
in
the
san
bernardino
area,
and
to
negotiate
for
clearance
over
theatres
in
competition
with
plaintiff's
said
theatre
upon
said
first-run,
including
defendant's
bel-air
drive-in
theatre.
that
plaintiff
is
without
any
speedy
or
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
will
be
irreparably
harmed
unless
defendant
and
its
officers,
agents,
and
employees
are
restrained
and
enjoined
from
instituting
any
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
against
plaintiff
and
said
distributors,
or
any
of
them,
based
upon
the
facts
hereinabove
alleged
during
the
pendency
of
this
action.
and
until
--
and
until
such
time
as
the
court
shall
determine
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
have
equal
and
correlative
rights
to
license
a
prior
run
with
clearance
on
behalf
of
their
respective
theatres.”
i
should
say
also
that
the
traditional
hallmark
of
a
suit
in
equity,
that
is
the
absence
of
a
prayer
from
monetary
damages,
is
apparent
here
in
our
prayer.n
ow
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
it's
conceivable
it
can.
i
agree,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
the
general
rule
would
be
out
of
line.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
you
asked
for
a
judgment
for
a
declaration
of
rights.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
regardless
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
would
think
not,
your
honor.
for
the
reason
that
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
constitutes
or
is
constituted
by
the
threats
of
duress,
which
we
say
were
unlawfully
exercised
or
wrongfully
exercised.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
because
there
was
competition.
now,
there
is
a
collateral
aspect
to
that,
too,
to
answer
your
question
fully,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
can
conceive
of
the
situation
in
which
a
party
has
the
right
to
negotiate
for
a
prior
run
without
clearance.
that
is,
i
can
see
that
a
supplier
of
motion
pictures
has,
absent
a
conspiracy,
the
right
to
pick
his
costumers
as
he
sees
fit.
and
that,
i
think
also
could
be
the
subject
of
adjudication
under
this
complaint
heard
as
an
equity
action.
now,
as
i
say,
the
gravamen
of
this
action
is
the
allegation
of
threats
and
the
effect
those
threats
have
had.
that
is
a
fact
to
be
determined
by
the
court
sitting
in
equity.
as
is
the
question
of
competition
may
very
well
be
a
fact
to
be
determined
by
the
court
sitting
in
equity.
now,
i
must
pause
there
and
say
that
if
an
equity
action
is
properly
alleged,
it's
of
course
within
the
power
of
the
chancellor
to
decide
questions
of
fact.
we
can
only
turn
to
the
--
or
need
only
turn
to
the
familiar
examples
of
a
specific
damage
or
a
specific
performance,
action
based
of
the
--
an
action
for
damages
on
contract
or
an
action
to
quiet
title
versus
an
action
in
ejectment.
those
two
sets
of
examples
present,
and
i
could
modify
them,
present
situations
in
which
the
chancellor
and
the
court
or
the
law
side
of
the
court
have
equivalent
duties
and
equivalent
powers.
so,
i
say
here,
simply
because
there
are
factual
issues
for
the
resolution
of
the
judge
sitting
as
an
equity
judge
does
not
ipso
facto
deprive
him
of
equity
jurisdiction.
i'm
of
course
stating
obvious
law
but
you
cannot
dismiss
this
complaint
or
characterize
it
as
an
action
of
law
simply
by
saying
there
are
various
factual
issues
which
under
other
circumstances
might
well
be
tried
by
a
jury.
we've
asked
for
a
very
narrow
relief
here.
this
is
not
a
substitute
for
an
antitrust
action
in
the
traditional
sense.
we've
asked
for
only
one
thing.
that
we
be
allowed
to
negotiate
equally
with
the
other
party,
with
the
defendant
for
a
first-run
with
clearance.
now,
the
fact
this
is
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
--
not
a
subject
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
clearance,
mr.
justice
brennan,
unless
they
were
competition.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
right.
except
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
he
says
there
is
no
competition.
except
i
must
qualify
that
in
the
example
that
i,
perhaps,
put
in
perfectly
to
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
i
can
conceive
of
situations
in
which
either
party
might
have
the
right
to
negotiate
for
a
first-run
without
respect
to
clearance,
simply
on
the
proposition
that
a
supplier
and
a
purchaser
can
deal
together
outside
of
the
public
utility
law
or
some
comparable
field.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
we
did,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
we
did
not
pursue
the
summary
remedies
that
are
available
such
as
getting
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
a
preliminary
injunction
which
we
would
have
to
do
by
affidavit
or
verify
a
complaint.
and
i
must
go
outside
the
record
to
answer
your
question
fully,
if
i
may.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
the
court
had
set
our
case
down
for
trial
after
these
motions
and
so
forth,
as
i
recall
it
in
july
of
1957.
so
that
--
and
we
had
constantly
urged
upon
the
court,
and
this
does
appear
in
the
record,
that
it
set
our
case
down
for
an
early
trial.
we
--
we
followed
all
the
provisions
of
the
rules,
so
far
as
i
am
aware
of
them,
with
respect
to
our
getting
an
injunction
on
a
full
hearing.
we
would
have
had
to
do
additional
things
to
secure
a
preliminary
injunction
or
restraining
order,
i
conceive
that.
now,
going
back
to
the
matter,
of
whether
or
not
this
is
in
fact
a
substitute
for
the
provisional
treble
damage
action,
i
would
say
that
the
proof
that
it
is
not
is
found
in
the
type
of
action
that
ultimately,
the
defendant
filed
by
way
of
counterclaim.
in
that,
and
the
specifications
of
conspiracy
that
are
there
alleged
are
found
starting
at
page
39
of
the
record.
preliminarily,
i
should
like
to
call
attention.
this
is
in
the
counterclaim,
to
make
it
intelligible,
of
the
defendant.
preliminarily,
i
should
like
to
mention
that
on
page
39,
in
paragraph
(e),
it
is
alleged
that
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
and
maintaining
a
monopoly
of
exclusive,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“exclusive”,
first-run
exhibition,
and
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
and
maintaining
a
monopoly
of
first-run
patronage,
three
exhibitors
entered
into
a
combination
conspiracy
attempt
to
monopolize
and
so
forth,
as
herein
after
alleged.
now,
that
is
much
broader
than
the
narrow
thing
we
seek
in
the
complaint.
we
acknowledge
that
the
defendant
here
has
an
equivalent
right
with
us
to
first-run.
so,
the
adjudication
of
the
issue
put
or
posed
in
our
complaint
would
be
neither
the
defense
to
the
charge
that
is
made
here
in
(e),
or
would
it
be
necessarily
adjudicated
by
a
jury
finding
on
(e).
we
certainly,
according
to
our
complaint,
have
not
sought
and
do
not
seek
an
exclusive
first-run.
we
simply
seek,
as
i
have
repeated,
perhaps
ad
nauseam,
the
right
to
negotiate
equally
with
the
defendant.
now,
following
along
with
the
various
specifications,
i
shall
try
to
paraphrase
them
and
they're
found
at
pages
39,
40,
and
41
of
the
record,
that
the
specifications
are
seven
in
number.
one,
six,
and
seven
charge
a
conspiracy
among
the
three
exhibitors
there
mentioned,
to
arrogate
to
themselves
a
monopoly
of
first-run
exhibition
in
san
bernardino.
and
in
one
of
those
specifications,
there
is
broader
language
that
says
in
other
areas,
i
believe.
specifications
2
and
3
deal
with
an
allocation
of
product
among
the
three
exhibitors,
sometimes
called
in
the
parlance
of
the
industry
as
split
of
product.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
a
split
of
product.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
an
industry
not
a
legal
phrase.
specifications
4
and
5
deal
with
imposing
clearance
in
favor
of
the
three
exhibitors
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
monopoly
of
first-run
exhibition
in
those
three
exhibitors.
again
i
say,
and
i
answer
that
as
i
answered
specifications
1
and
2.
we
do
not
seek
an
exclusive
right
to
first-run
exhibition,
simply
a
correlative
one
and
the
right
to
negotiate
for
it.
now,
counsel
has
made
some
reference
to
so-called
anticipatory
suits
citing
the
di
giovanni
case
and
perhaps
others.
i
think,
fairly
read,
our
complaint
does
not
indicate
the
anticipation
of
a
suit.
in
the
di
giovanni
case,
the
facts
of
the
complaint
or
the
allegations,
i
should
say
the
complaint
was
that
the
defendant
has
threatened
and
is
about
to
sue.
in
other
words,
the
eminence
of
a
suit
at
law,
which
was
to
be
brought,
was
apparent
from
the
pleading
of
the
plaintiff
there.
there
is
no
comparable
allegation
in
our
complaint.
we
couldn't
allege,
of
course,
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
intend
to
sue
because
that
would
render
the
allegations
of
the
threat
being
harmful
to
us
that
are
rather
empty
thing.
it
is
a
question
and
a
problem
of
--
and
the
anxiety
or
doubt
as
to
whether
the
defendant
would
sue
that
gives
rise
to
our
cause
of
action.
as
long
as
this
club
was
held
over
our
heads
and
was
working,
there
was
really
no
haste.
there
was
no
real
purpose
in
the
defendant
filing
a
suit.
the
defendant
was
achieving
its
purpose
by
keeping
us
from
the
mark.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
may
answer
that
this
way,
your
honor.
the
possibility
of
their
filing
a
suit
was
always
present
in
our
minds.
the
certainty
of
it
was
not
present.
in
other
words,
we
did
not
know
whether
or
not
a
suit
would
be
filed.
it
was
that
doubt,
that
anxiety
that
permeated
our
thinking
in
the
drafting
of
this.
but
if
--
if
--
should
eventuate
that
suit
should
be
filed,
which
ultimately
it
was,
then
the
prayer
might
have
some
force
and
effect.
now,
we
perhaps
may
have
conceived
--
misconceived
our
remedy
here,
perhaps
as
judge
pope
pointed
out.
what
we
should
have
done
was
to
seek
in
our
prayer
not
an
injunction
against
a
suit.
and
i
question,
quite
candidly,
whether
such
an
injunction
would
lie.
what
we
perhaps
should
have
done
in
drafting
the
prayer
was
to
seek
an
injunction
against
the
continuation
of
the
threats
of
suit.
but
again,
i
can
only
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
your
question
that
there
was
a
doubt
as
to
whether
a
suit
would
be
brought.
had
we
been
certain
that
suit
was
to
be
brought,
we
would
have
alleged
as
the
plaintiff
did
in
di
giovanni
that
the
defendant
was
about
to
institute
suit.
and
you
will
find
no
such
allegation
in
our
complaint.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
in
that
suit
we
felt
that
we
could
not
have
adjudicated
the
right
that
we
seek
to
have
adjudicated
in
this
complaint,
we
may
have
sought
that.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
would
say
we
would
perhaps
have
sought
a
restraining
order
or
an
injunction
pendente
lite
with
respect
to
that
suit.
we
would
have
--
in
other
words,
we
would
have
sought
the
same
order
of
trial
that
we
now
seek.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor,
because
i
say
that
the
issues
in
the
two
suits
that
have
actually
been
filed
are
so
disparate
that
the
jury
trial
of
the
counterclaim
is
not
going
to
serve
as
an
adjudication
of
our
rights
under
the
complaint
nor
of
what
--
what
is
found
as
a
complaint
served
as
a
defense
to
the
charges
contained
in
the
counterclaim.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
it's
just
pendente
lite
during
the
pendency
of
this
suit.
after
that,
they
could've
filed
a
suit
if
they
did
file
and
have
a
full
determination
by
the
jury
of
the
issues
that
are
--
there
presented
in
their
counterclaim.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
the
claim
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
and
we
--
i
doubt
that
we
could
seek
such
relief.
i
--
i
think
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
beyond
the
process
of
the
court
to
issue
such
an
injunction.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
--
i
can't
conceive
that
we
could
--
we
might
ask
for
it,
but
i
can't
conceive
of
a
court
granting
it.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
oh,
no,
we
couldn't
and
didn't
intend
to
ask
for
a
permanent
injunction
against
a
filing
of
the
suit
perpetually
by
the
defendant.
and
as
i
say,
it
would
be
an
abuse,
i
think
of
any
court's
discretion
to
or
power
to
grant
such
an
injunction.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
they
would.
without
equivocation,
i'd
say
they
would.
there
would
be
no
estoppel,
adjudication,
res
adjudication
--
res
judicata
of
their
rights.
they
would
be
entitled
to
go
forward
with
their
complaint
or
i
should
say
their
counterclaim
or
if
they
filed
it
independently
a
complaint
alleging
the
same
things
that
they
have
alleged.
and
what
had
been
decided
in
our
complaint
would
not
be
a
defense
to
the
charges
that
they
make.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
in
whole
or
in
part.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
oh,
one
issue.
if
--
if
they
chose
to
raise
this
issue,
there
would
be
an
adjudication
of
whether
or
not
there
was
competition
between
the
two
theatres.
on
that
single
issue.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
it
might
or
might
not
be.
it
isn't
in
this
counterclaim.
in
the
suit
that
was
actually
found
or
in
the
suit
that
was
actually
filed,
the
matter
of
competition
is
--
is
not
set
forth
as
a
paramount
or
even
a
vital
or
collateral
issue
as
i
read
it.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
that's
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that
is
not
right,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
only
if
the
issue
of
competition
were
raised
in
the
antitrust
action,
which
i
say
it
was
not
raised.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
it
--
speaking
in
general
terms,
yes,
your
honor.
but
i'm
speaking
in
terms
of
competition
between
two
specific
theatres.
every
antitrust
action,
of
course,
is
based
upon
a
restraint
of
competition.
but
we
asked
the
court
to
as
an
incident
of
our
right
for
relief
from
its
duress
to
determine
whether
there
was
competition
in
the
technical
sense,
whether
two
theatres
were
drawing
from
the
same
pool
of
patronage.
that's
the
sense
in
which
i
use
competition.
in
that
limited
sense,
not
in
the
broad
general
sense,
restraint
of
competition
as
it's
commonly
used
in
--
in
private
--
treble
damage
suits.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
if
--
if
i
answer
the
last
question
first,
at
least
we
might've
been
able
to
have
purchased
product
from
the
distributors
rather
than
having
the
door
shut
in
our
face
because
i
assumed
that
the
defendant
would
respect
the
order
of
the
court
to
desist
from
the
threats
that
they
would
sue
or
--
or
it
would
sue
the
distributors
if
they
talk
to
us
about
getting
first-run
pictures.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
it
was
put
in
very
general
terms.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i'm
reading
from
page
18.
“and
that
plaintiff
will
be
subjected
to
an
action
by
said
defendant
for
treble
damages
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.”
now,
what
that
action
might
be,
what
it
might
specify
as
a
conspiracy
is
--
was
unknown
at
the
time
of
the
complaint,
but
as
i
have
just
tried
to
indicate,
the
counterclaim
goes
beyond
and
is
broader
than
the
issues,
we
have
sought
to
have
determined
in
our
complaint.
the
counterclaim,
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out,
has
as
--
it's
not
the
arrogation
to
fox
west
coast,
specific
drive-in
theatres
in
stanley-warner
of
the
monopoly
of
first-run
exhibition
in
the
san
bernardino
area,
plus
allegations
of
allocation
of
product
among
those
three
exhibitors.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
now
if
they
had
sued
you
under
the
clayton
act
then
they
could've
proven
that
you'd
violated
it.
before
a
jury
they
could've
gotten
a
verdict
to
that.
and
you
said
they
were
threatening
to
sue
you
under
the
clayton
act.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
they
could
have
sued
us
for
what
--
perhaps
what
we
claimed
in
our
complaint
or
made
that
the
basis
of
their
counterclaim
but
they
didn't
choose
to
do
so.
they
chose
to
go
beyond
that.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
the
court
grants
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
not
as
the
pleadings
are
now
framed.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
they
have
sued
us.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
they
--
and
they
have
sued
us,
mr.
justice
black.
they
have
sued
us.
they've
not
only
threatened
but
now
they
have
sued
us.
and
that
complaint
is
framed
on
a
different
theory
if
i
were
--
and
that
counterclaim
is
framed
on
a
different
theory
than
is
our
complaint.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
yes.
but
there
is
an
additional
element
that
must
be
proved
to
support
the
allegation
of
number
1,
that
is
a
conspiracy,
the
--
the
one
--
the
one
element
that
would
be
res
judicata
is,
was
there
competition
between
the
two
theatres?
that
would
be
determined
by
our
complaint.
did
they
draw
from
the
same
pool
of
patronage?
now,
whether
a
conspiracy
existed
to
give
clearance,
either
whether
competition
is
found
to
exist,
or
is
not
found
to
exist,
would
still
have
to
be
determined
under
number
1
here.
that
is
the
distinction
i
make.
in
other
words,
the
counterclaim
must
show
a
conspiracy.
our
complaint
has
nothing
to
do
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
right.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
the
competition
would
be
determined,
not
clearance.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
not
clearance,
simply
the
existence
of
a
competition.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
--
if
it
were
granted
absent
the
conspiracy.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
we
don't
touch
upon
a
conspiracy
question
in
our
complaint.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that
is
the
distinction
i
tried
to
make,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
he
would
have
to
prove
conspiracy.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
--
i
don't
know
how
much
effect
it
would
have.
i
doubt
if
it
would
have
a
great
deal
of
effect
if
he
proves
a
conspiracy
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
the
judge
in
the
equity
suit
finds
the
existence
of
competition
and
instructs
the
jury
that
he
has
so
found
or
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
in
some
way,
that
competition
exists
and
they
are
not
to
pass
upon
that
single
point.
now,
if
the
defendant
--
the
counterclaim
adherent,
can
show
a
conspiracy
in
the
grant
of
clearance
with
competition,
let
me
take
one
example
which
had
been
frequently
urged.
suppose
every
distributor
granted
a
--
i'll
pick
a
figure
out
of
the
air,
7-day
or
14-day
clearance.
now,
that
would
be
a
fact
that
would
go
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
an
agreement
among
the
distributors
and
the
exhibitor
to
grant
a
uniform
clearance,
whether
there
had
been
a
conspiracy.
that
element,
that
item
is
not
determined
under
the
allegations
of
our
complaint.
we
do
not
ask
in
our
complaint
at
all
to
have
it
determined
whether
how
much
clearance
should
be
granted.
we
simply
say,
“can
we
negotiate
equally
with
the
other
theatre
for
a
clearance?”
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that
wouldn't
be
our
case.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
oh,
no,
we'd
lost
ours.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
because
he
alleges
other
things.
he
alleges
an
agreement
to
allocate
products
among
the
distributors
in
specifications
2
and
3
of
his
counterclaim
which
is
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
not
in
my
opinion,
sir.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
not
in
any
of
it.
because
i
have
to
take
his
complaint
or
his
counterclaim
as
he
has
pleaded
it
which
is
basically
two
things.
it
is
an
arrogation
to
three
exhibitors
of
the
monopoly
of
first-run
exhibition
in
the
san
bernardino
area.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
say
not
--
whether
or
not
competition
exists
would
not
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
he
can
prove
it
this
way.
that
the
distributors
conspired
with
the
exhibitors
to
grant
them
first-run
in
theatres
which
were
in
no
sense
superior
to
the
theatre
operated
by
the
defendant.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
he
--
no,
you're
talking
about
damages
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
compare
his
theatre
with
one
another.
but
if
he
has
a
theatre
which
is
equally
well-situated
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
but
somewhere
else,
which
has
the
same
attributes,
the
same
characteristics
so
as
to
entitle
it
to
a
first-run,
and
he
is
denied
first
run.
and
he
sees
three
theatres
in
san
bernardino
being
granted
first-run,
when
his
theater
is
equally
well-situated,
equally
well-adapted
for
the
exhibition
of
first-run
pictures
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
could
he
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
to
be
factual,
it
isn't
remote,
it's
11
miles
away.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
it
does,
but
the
theatres,
of
course,
the
example
is
--
that
you
have
given
of
a
theatre
in
pittsburgh
is
just
quite
remote
from
a
theatre
in
san
bernardino.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
right.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
he
won't
--
it
--
i
say
he
does
not
have
to
prove
that
to
prove
his
case.
i'd
say
he
--
he
simply
has
to
prove
this,
whether
or
not
he
is
in
competition.
if
his
theatre,
being
situated
where
it
was,
being
the
character
theatre
it
is,
is
not
accorded
the
first-run,
he
has
something
to
go
to
the
jury
with
and
the
jury
i
think
could
come
in
with
a
finding
or
a
verdict
in
his
favor
that
i
have
a
theatre
in
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
all
right,
say
--
let's
say
in
pittsburg.
or
i
have
a
theatre
in
los
angeles.
or
i
have
a
theater
in
colton,
which
is
a
point
a
little
further
than
those
from
san
bernardino.
he
should
be
entitled
to
equivalent
rights
if
there
is
--
well,
under
any
circumstances,
involving
a
conspiracy.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
he
perhaps
--
he
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
--
i
could
conceive
of
a
situation
where
that
might
arise.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
would
think
such
a
theory
could
be
developed,
and
if
--
let
us
pursue
your
example,
mr.
justice
stewart
further.
suppose
a
theatre
superior
in
pittsburg
in
appointments,
in
seating
capacity,
in
location
and
in
every
other
factor
was
placed
upon
by
the
distributors
a
long
delayed
run,
i
would
think
pointing
to
inferior
theatres
in
other
parts
of
the
country
would
receive
a
preferred
run,
would
establish
a
cause
of
action
in
the
plaintiff.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
don't
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
that
they
compete
for
the
same
audience
to
prove
the
allegation
that
he
has
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
right.
and
there's
another
type
of
conspiracy
that
is
--
which
is
alleged
in
--
in
specifications
2
and
3,
to
divide
the
product
among
the
three
exhibitors.
now,
that
isn't
a
--
an
issue
in
our
complaint
under
any
stretch
of
interpretation.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
clark,
but
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
to
--
to
hear
of
one.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
oh,
no.
i
--
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
realize
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
yes,
because
i
have
taken
that
line
because
i
conceive
that
there
are
no
common
questions
of
fact.
but
assuming,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
there
are
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument,
there
are
and
under
circumstances
here,
there
could
be
one
common
question
of
fact
and
that
is
the
question
of
competition.
i
don't
deny
that
it
could
come
into
the
case.
i
suggest
it's
highly
improbable
as
coming
to
the
defendant's
case
under
his
counterclaim.
but
assuming
that
there
is
a
common
question
of
fact
or
common
questions
of
fact,
that
does
not
deprive
us
of
a
right
to
equitable
relief.
well,
the
reason
i
mentioned
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
for
the
reason
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
that
equity,
if
it
can
assume
jurisdiction
properly,
can
decide
on
certain
questions
of
fact.
and
the
chance
that
a
suit
may
later
be
brought,
which
could
litigate
those
same
questions
of
fact,
doesn't
deprive
equity
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
there
--
i
conceive
of
--
you're
talking
about
the
facts
in
our
complaint,
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
--
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
there
are
no
other
facts.
the
facts
that
we
alleged
are
so
interwoven
that
once
the
judge
had
decided
those
facts,
he
had
decided
all
the
issues
posed
by
our
complaint
because
those
issues
are
very
narrow
and
very
limited.
were
there
threats?
was
there
competition?
was
there
irreparable
harm?
was
there
an
adequate
remedy
of
law?
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
the
facts
of
the
counterclaim
would
then
be
tried
through
a
jury.
and
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
will
and
perhaps,
i
can
elaborate
best
by
referring
to
the
judge's
response
to
the
petition
for
mandamus.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
conceive
of
only
one
that
might
possibly
be,
depending
upon
the
proof
adduced
under
the
counterclaim.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
and
that
is
the
question
of
competition,
whether
the
two
theatres
drew
from
the
same
pool
of
patronage.
that
might
or
might
not
be
an
issue
in
the
counterclaim
depending
upon
--
and
this
i
think
is
a
significant
thing
--
depending
upon
which
tact
or
how
the
defendant
wished
to
present
its
case.
now,
that
is
one
reason
that
i
feel
that
this
equitable
action
is
a
problem
here.
the
defendant
can
direct
his
order
of
proof.
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
defendant
decides
to
prove
a
conspiracy
simply
to
allocate
product.
then
there
are
--
there
are
no
common
issues.
there
is
nothing
that
is
in
this
complaint
that
we
can
have
adjudicated
in
the
counterclaim.
there
is
nothing
that
is
decided
in
this
compliant
that
would
have
served
as
a
defense
to
that
particular
specification
of
conspiracy.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
it
would
depend
on
what
type
of
action
he
filed
and
what
he
sought
to
prove
in
the
trial
of
his
action.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
--
well,
again,
i
can't
answer
that
in
advance,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
don't
know
what
he's
going
to
try
to
prove
under
his
counterclaim.
he
may
--
if
he
--
if
he
goes
to
the
point
of
competition,
if
he
thinks
that
that
is
an
issue
in
the
case,
then
the
issue
of
whether
there's
competition
between
these
two
theatres
would
be
res
judicata
in
his
--
in
his
suit.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
it
would
be.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
--if
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
he
decides
to
develop
a
conspiracy
revolving
around
that,
but
i
don't
know
and
we
don't
know
yet
whether
he
so
proposes
or
whether
he
has
proof.
that's
why
i
say,
and
perhaps
imperfectly
that
what
we
have
alleged
here
is
neither
a
defense
to
his
counterclaim
necessarily,
a
prejudgment
of
it
or
will
we
have
the
privilege
of
having
it
adjudicated
during
the
course
of
the
trial
of
his
counterclaim.
we
have
--
if
i
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
excuse
me.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
the
question
of
whether
competition
exists
between
two
theatres
is
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
the
judge
would
make
the
finding
of
fact
upon
it.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
it
can
be
a
question
that
can
be
decided
by
a
court
of
equity.
a
court
of
equity
has
the
power
to
decide
questions
of
fact
such
as
under
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
think
it
can
in
this
equity
proceeding
as
it
can
in
any
other
equity
proceeding,
be
assumed
to
--
and
decided
by
the
judge
sitting
in
equity.
i
gave
the
familiar
examples
of
specific
performance.
there
the
judge
sitting
as
a
chancellor
must
decide
among
other
things
questions
of
fact.
was
a
contract
made?
in
an
action
for
quiet
title,
the
judge
must
decide
questions
of
fact.
where
--
where
was
the
title?
where
was
possession?
now,
those
questions
might
also
be
common
to
a
question
or
to
a
case,
as
i
put
before,
for
breach
of
damages
for
contract
or
for
ejectment
in
which
a
jury
can
be
had.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
will,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
believe,
first,
to
answer
your
second
question,
the
question
is
before
this
court.
the
court
below,
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
position,
if
i
apprehend
it
carefully,
that
there
was
no
violation,
no
excessive
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge,
so
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
that
court
to
issue
a
writ.
now,
i
take
it,
that
is
what
is
before
this
court
for
review,
whether
the
court
was
in
error
in
that
respect.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
don't
think
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
--
it's
necessary.
i
think
the
case
is
here
before
this
court
for
adjudication
on
--
properly
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mandamus
should
or
should
not
issue.
implicit
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
certainly
that
mandamus
does
not
lie
here.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
does
not
lie.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
i
--
i
should
say
should
not
be
granted.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
think
i
should
always
rely
on
that.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
yes,
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
precisely,
your
honor.
now,
going
back,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
the
question
of
mandamus
here
in
this
general
sense,
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
foreclosed
from
arguing
by
the
la
buy
case,
whether
or
not
the
court
should
issue
mandamus.
i
will
--
i
--
i
must
say
that
there
are
some
points
of
distinction
which
i
do
not
wish
to
and
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
label.
i
say
only
this
that
let
us
assume
the
power.
and
i
do
not
wish
to
concede
it,
but
let
us
assume
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
mandamus
rather
than
reviewing
this
by
appeal
which
seems
to
me
the
orderly
way
to
review
this
that
i
might
digress
for
a
moment
to
say
why.
because
after
this
case
is
tried,
we're
simply
in
a
pleading
stage
here.
after
this
case
is
tried
or
even
partially
tried,
under
the
new
appeal
statute,
there'll
be
a
remedy
available
to
the
defendant,
to
come
to
this
court.
but
now,
talking
again
about
mandamus,
conceding
the
power,
i
simply
say
as
it's
well
known
to
this
court,
it's
sparingly
used
and
in
only
exceptional
circumstances.
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
used
here
to
review
the
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
who
was
simply
following
the
mandate
of
rule
42
(b)
and
arranging
its
calendar
in
a
way
that
he
deems
appropriate.
i
do
not
feel
that
the
promulgation
of
the
rules
of
procedure
have
abolished
the
traditional
differences
between
law
and
equity.
equity
jurisdiction
can
still
be
invoked
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
i
--
i
cannot
say
more
about
the
power
of
the
court.
i
simply
question
it.
i
say
that
mandamus
here
was
not
a
remedy
that
should
have
been
invoked.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
--
i
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
power
does
not
exist.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
and
i
might
say
in
closing,
that
i
do
not
read
the
record
in
its
present
posture.
it
shows
with
requisite,
clarity,
and
certainty
that
the
petitioner
here
is
going
to
be
deprived
of
a
jury
trial
on
any
fundamental
or
basic
issue
that
is
now
deducible
or
inferable
from
the
pleadings.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
i
think
it
should
be
the
end
of
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
hearing,
mr.
justice
black.
it
might
not
be
on
some
further
appeal.
this
is
not
necessarily
the
end
of
this
case.
if
there
is
error
committed
now,
which
i
do
not
concede,
in
fact,
i
think
the
court
has
acted
with
entire
propriety.
but
it's
if
it
should
and
i
assume
that
you
are
thinking,
mr.
justice
black,
of
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
to
make
it
more
nearly
impinged
upon
the
allegations
or
fit
in
the
allegations.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
because,
mr.
justice
black,
the
alleged
harm
by
reason
of
the
fact
we
were
not
able
to
get
motion
pictures.
the
judge
said
that
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
and
the
question
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
and
the
question
of
when,
mr.
justice
black.
for
this
reason,
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
length
of
the
ordinary
treble
damage
action.
in
our
district,
i
think
it
is
averaged
around,
in
a
motion
picture
industry,
around
six
weeks
or
thereabouts.
now,
the
issues
framed
by
our
complaint
as
i
informed
the
court
were
separately
filed
in
july
of
1957.
we
asked
persistently
for
an
early
trial
date.
that
is
a
reason,
i
think
a
sufficient
reason
why
the
court
can
say
you
can
have
this
matter
tried
in
which
you
are
alleging
irreparable
injury
which
--
which
trial
will
consume
a
matter
of
two
or
three
days
before
we
can
arrange
the
calendar
so
that
there
can
be
a
full-blown
hearing
in
a
trial
that
may
last
six
weeks
or
more.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
in
other
words
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
i
--
i
say
that
the
court
--
the
complaints
should
be
construed
as
a
--
a
complaint
in
equity.
and
that
--
when
i
say
that,
i
then
say
that
the
jury
is
not
appropriate.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
not
even
discretionary.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
whether
or
not
a
jury
can
be
--
had
in
a
declaratory
relief
action
depends
upon
the
allegations
of
that
particular
declaratory
relief
suit.
if
it
sounds
in
equity,
it's
an
equity
case.
if
it
sounds
in
law,
it's
a
law
case
and
a
--
a
jury
can
be
demanded.
it
is
our
position
that
this
declaratory
judgment,
suits,
sounds
in
equity
and
therefore
it
is
triable
not
by
a
jury
but
by
a
judge.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
not
if
it's
an
equity
case.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
that's
right,
yes.
but
not
as
a
finding,
a
finder
of
fact.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
in
one
case,
i
won't
use
your
phrase,
“of
a
defeat
of
a
trial
by
jury.”
in
one
case,
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
a
stewart
case,
i
think
it's
in
296,
that
procedure
was
followed.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
enelow?
a
--
is
an
earlier
case
and
it
reaches
the
opposite
result
but
it
is
a
different
case
in
this.
in
the
--
in
the
stewart
case,
there
was
an
incontestable
clause
so
that
the
insurance
company
didn't
know
whether
it
could
have
its
right
adjudicated
within
a
two-year
period
which
was
a
period
of
incontestability
or
not.
the
enelow
case
as
i
recall
it,
there
was
no
such
clause
or
at
least
it
wasn't
the
subject
of
discussion
by
the
court.
now,
i
--
i
do
not
agree
with
the
--
your
position
that
in
any
case,
a
jury
trial
can
be
defeated
by
the
device,
if
we
choose
to
call
it
such,
of
--
of
filing
a
suit
in
equity.
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
well,
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
--
if
he
--
mr.
frank
r.
johnston
if
he
has
a
true
case
in
equity
and
if
that
case
will
not
dispose
of
all
of
the
issues
which
might
later
be
brought
or
which
might
later
be
posed
in
a
legal
suit,
certainly,
then
he
has
the
right
to
have
that
equity
case
heard
and
heard
when?
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
it's
proper
to
hear
it.
