justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
this
application
for
a
jury
trial
before
you
filed
your
counterclaim?
justice
john
m.
harlan
same
pleading
but
this
â€“-
this
demand
for
a
jury
trial
was
independently
of
the
issues
raised
with
the
counterclaim.
in
other
words,
you
said
you
were
entitled
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
the
jury
trials
just
as
if
you'd
filed
no
counterclaim
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
issue
before
us?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
decisions
in
this
court
do
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
if
the
construction
of
the
paramount
was
included?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
very
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
johnston?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
consider
that
you
have
to
stand
or
fall
in
this
court
on
the
question
is
to
whether
--
on
the
--
on
the
proposition
that
there
are
no
common
questions
of
fact
involved
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
realize
the
discussion
up
to
date
has
been
on
that
premise,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
i'm
anticipating
something.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
save
two
or
three
minutes
to
discuss
your
mandamus
point,
your
point
one
in
the
brief
and
particularly,
mr.
corinblit's
answer
to
you
that
this
question
before
us
is
improbably
before
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
haven't
cross-petitioned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
answer
to
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you'd
have
to
stand
on
power
because
it
is
a
pure
question
of
discretion.
i
don't
see
why
we
should
substitute
our
views
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
stand
on
power,
you
have
to
deal
with
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
