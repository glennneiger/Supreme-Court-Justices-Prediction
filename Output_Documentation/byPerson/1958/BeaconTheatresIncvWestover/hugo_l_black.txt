did
you
say
that
case
was
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
scott
versus
neely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
allegation
of
--
of
the
usually
equitable
nature
that
could
not
have
been
determined
when
a
suit
of
law
alleged
in
the
petition
declaratory
judgment?
justice
hugo

no
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
a
suit
should
be
allowed
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
there
any
issue
in
connection
with
the
transaction
which
was
the
basis
of
this
previous
lawsuit
as
to
the
substance
of
it
which
would
--
whereby,
it
showed
that
they
would
be
deprived
of
some
relief
that
they
could
get
in
equity
as
a
substantive
answer
to
the
charging
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
it's
a
jury
question
or
not
is
there
anything
to
keep
the
court
from
--
the
question
i
ask
if
you
will
permit
me.
what
i
had
in
mind
was,
was
there
anything
that
the
--
that
the
relief
they
sought
either
which
required
the
interpretation
by
the
court,
or
a
decision
of
fact
by
the
jury
which
could
not
have
been
fairly
tried
out
in
the
suit
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
what
i
have
in
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
would
it
be
material
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
it
be
material
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
your
counterclaim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
your
counterclaim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
one
of
the
grounds
of
your
--
are
you
asking
us
to
pass
the
fact
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
raising
your
question
in
whatever
the
complaint
charge
and
whether
or
not
it
was
could
have
been
adjudicated
in
equity
when
you
filed
your
counterclaim
raising
precisely
the
same
issues
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
to
try
that
counterclaim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
raising
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
duty
--
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
to
try
--
try
the
counterclaim
for
jury,
are
you
asking
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
abandoning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
say
that
(inaudible)
entitled
to
--
do
understand
that
if
the
--
the
controversy
over
the
validity
of
a
patent
and
the
patentee
comes
in
and
asks
for
an
interpretation
of
the
patent
in
equity,
and
the
other
side
says
that
--
i
mean,
not
the
patentee,
the
man
who
said
there
had
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
the
other
man
comes
in
and
says,
“i
want
to
sue
him
on
there
and
not
put
in
a
counterclaim.”
do
you
mean
that
the
cases
have
held
that
there
could
be
a
jury
trial
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
cited
those?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
basis
of
the
jury
trial
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
have
not
cited
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
find
them
in
your
brief.
i
thought
your
adversary
cited
them
as
on
his
side.
those
insurance
cases
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
enelow
and
the
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
cite
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
whole
or
in
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it
be
res
judicata
as
far
as
the
determination
on
the
fact
is
of
concern?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
vital
issue
on
the
antitrust
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
your
complaint,
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
complaint
--
but
i
thought
your
complaint
was
to
set
up
certain
facts,
reasons
why
you
were
not
guilty
of
violating
the
antitrust
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
not
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
those
--
if
--
if
what
you
say
was
true,
would
that
have
had
no
effect
whatever
on
an
antitrust
proceeding,
as
a
defense?
could
you
not
have
set
this
up
as
a
defense
to
the
antitrust
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
antitrust
action
is
usually
based
somewhat
on
the
restraint
of
competition,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
duress
you
set
up
was,
if
they
were
threatening
to
sue
you
for
--
on
allegations
of
facts
that
were
not
correct,
wasn't
it?
and
that
you
didn't
show
the
court
they
were
not
and
if
they
allowed
them
to
sue
you,
it'd
cost
you
irreparable
damage.
allowed
them
to
threaten
you,
whatever
that
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
be
a
distinction,
but
i
would
think
that
if
all
you
had
gotten
was
an
injunction
against
their
threatening
to
sue
you,
they
would
have
did
--
done
exactly
what
they
did
in
the
counterclaim
and
just
sued
you.
all
you
could've
gotten
was
an
injunction
there
against
threatening.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
threaten
to
sue
you
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
from
your
complaint
that
they
understand
to
threaten
to
sue
you
about?
what
kind
of
suit
are
they
threatening
to
file
against
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
set
up
certain
facts
to
bar
them
from
suing
you.
wouldn't
those
facts
have
been
a
defense
if
they
claim
what
you
say
you're
not
guilty
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
sued
you
for
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
could
amend
it
yet,
couldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
--
in
other
words,
that
issue
is
a
material
ingredient
of
a
claim
that
they
might
have
against
you
for
violating
the
clayton
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
--
it
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
offense
that
you're
afraid
they'll
sue
you
on,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they've
threatened
to
sue
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
not
lie
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
not
lie
or
should
not
be
granted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
not
deducible
from
the
complaint
as
it
had
drawn,
do
you
think
that's
the
end
of
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
think
about
it
frankly
was
this.
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
a
constitutional
requirement
of
a
trial
by
a
jury
in
certain
cases,
you
have
--
do
you
raise
the
question
that
some
of
these
as
--
issues
can
be
put
before
it
comes
to
the
court,
that
they
wouldn't
get
a
trial.
and
if
--
if
the
action
is
split
up
into
two
parts,
one
which
they
--
be
tried
by
equity
and
the
one
to
be
tried
by
court
of
law,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
you
don't
get
a
trial
by
jury
on
order.
it's
capable
of
being
amended.
it's
part
of
a
--
of
a
general
controversial
opinion.
what
reason
is
that
why
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
aside
from
all
of
the
other
questions
that
have
raised?
the
court
shouldn't
refrain
from
exercising
its
jurisdiction
to
split
up
a
cause
of
action
which
may
now
and
may
come
for
it
later
and
give
a
trial
by
jury
or
the
facts
of
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
because
you
can't
--
you
say
that
if
it's
left
up
in
the
air,
the
question
must
be
decided.
well,
you
are
--
you
--
you
can
get
it
decided,
this
question
of
whether
you
get
it
decided
by
a
jury
or
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
i
see
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you're
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
right
about
the
fact
of
the
complaint.
i
--
i
had
rather
thought
it
covered
here,
both
of
it.
but
if
you
are
right
about
the
fact
they
hadn't
raised
that
issue
and
you
only
have
it
in
that,
what's
wrong
with
the
court
giving
a
trial
by
--
a
jury
trial
in
connection
with
the
facts
you
allege
in
six
weeks?
or
what
is
there
about
the
rules
or
anything
else
that
bars
the
court?
it
says
that
the
statute,
anything
else,
it
says
when
you
have
a
action
for
declaratory
judgment,
if
you
alleged
some
equitable
grounds,
you
never
can
get
a
trial
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
about
any
petition
for
declaratory
judgment
where
the
court
has
absolute
discretion,
whether
you're
granted
or
not.
i
think
that's
usually
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
even
tried
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
can't
--
can't
grant
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
by
splitting
up
the
cause
of
action,
you
can
always
allege
some
grounds
for
equity
and
barred
your
return,
if
that's
the
case.
take
the
insurance
cases
where
they
come
in
and
say,
it
held
the
fellow
--
the
man
has
died.
say
he's
dead
and
we
think
he
got
this
by
a
clause.
we
want
to
try
that
question
right
now
and
you
get
it.
you
allege
that
as
ground
for
equity,
is
that
all?
do
they
--
can
they
always
defeat
a
trial
by
jury
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
enelow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
didn't
call
it
a
device.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
if
a
lawyer
has
that
method
and
referred
to
one
trial
to
the
other,
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
device.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
perhaps
--
