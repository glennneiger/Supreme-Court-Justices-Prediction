mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
jury
awarded
petitioner
$76,400.
the
trial
court
refused
to
set
the
verdict
aside.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
act
provided
the
exclusive
remedy.
in
reversing,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
pennsylvania
state
practice
as
to
the
functions
of
these
reforms
by
a
court
and
jury
in
determining
whether
there
was
an
employment
relationship
covered
by
the
compensation
act.
this
procedure
was
in
conflict
with
byrd
versus
blue
ridge
rural
electric
cooperative
inc.,
and
therefore
we
maintain
that
the
jury
verdict
should
be
reinstated.
the
petitioner
brought
this
suit
as
administrator
on
behalf
of
norman
ormsbee
jr.'s
widow
and
three
children.
ormsbee,
a
young
man
of
20,
had
been
killed
while
riding
on
a
truck
owned
by
a
man
named
fidler.
fidler
had
leased
the
truck
complete
with
driver
to
the
respondent.
the
driver
schroyer
had
picked
up
a
load
of
steel
and
had
proceeded
on
what
was
to
have
been
a
350-mile
journey.
because
of
a
combination
of
very
unusual
circumstances,
what
was
to
have
been
a
20-hour
trip
was
protracted
for
a
seven
day
period,
at
which
time
schroyer
had
not
yet
reached
his
destination.
among
other
things
schroyer
had
encountered
grave
mechanical
difficulty
with
the
truck,
and
so
he
asked
petitioner's
decedent,
ormsbee,
whom
he
had
casually
met
in
a
tavern
to
accompany
him
for
the
balance
of
the
trip
in
exchange
for
a
promised
payment
of
$25.
now
it
was
contrary
to
the
policy
of
both,
fidler
the
lessor,
and
the
respondent
to
permit
anyone
to
ride
on
the
truck
other
than
the
driver.
ormsbee
had
training
as
a
mechanic,
which
might
have
been
of
help
in
the
event
of
the
feared
breakdown
of
the
truck,
but
the
truck
crashed
about
five
hours
after
ormsbee
joined
schroyer
and
both
men
were
killed.
the
brakes
of
the
truck
were
extremely
defective.
the
evidence
establishes
that
this
defective
condition
resulted
from
the
wanton
negligence
of
the
respondent.
the
law
of
pennsylvania
is
that
a
defendant
is
liable
to
a
trespasser
only
for
wanton
negligence.
but
if
ormsbee
was
properly
present
on
the
truck,
by
virtue
of
the
emergency,
the
respondent
would
be
liable
even
for
ordinary
negligence.
the
respondent
vigorously
contended
that
ormsbee
was
a
mere
trespasser.
because
of
the
doubt
as
to
ormsbee's
right
to
be
on
the
truck,
the
jury
was
asked
to
answer
four
special
interrogatories,
as
well
as
to
return
a
general
verdict.
the
jury
found
that
there
had
been
wanton
negligence.
it
also
found
in
answer
to
interrogatory
number
one,
that
ormsbee
was
properly
present
on
the
truck,
which
meant
that
recovery
could
be
had
even
for
ordinary
negligence.
thus
the
jury
found
in
fact
that
ormsbee
was
not
a
trespasser.
now
the
precise
issues
tried
were
not
framed
exclusively
by
the
compliant
and
answer.
they
were
elaborated
on
both
sides
at
pre-trial,
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
record
at
page
208
a
of
the
trial
judge's
opinion.
now
as
a
result
of
this
elaboration
of
the
issues,
there
evolved
respondent's
alternative
affirmative
defense,
that
this
cause
of
action
was
barred
by
the
compensation
act.
now
this
suit
is
barred
by
the
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
act
only
if
two
circumstances
are
both
present.
first
this
suit
is
not
barred
unless
ormsbee
was
the
employee
of
respondent,
rather
than
say
of
fidler.
second,
even
if
ormsbee
was
the
employee
of
the
respondent,
this
suit
would
not
be
barred
if
the
employment
was,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
casual
and
not
in
the
regular
course
of
the
respondent's
business.
such
temporary
employees
are
simply
not
covered
by
the
compensation
act.
now
the
respondent
did
not
seek
a
jury
determination
of
either
of
these
two
questions
as
to
ormsbee's
employment
status,
although
both
had
to
be
resolved
in
its
favor
in
order
to
establish
what
it
concedes
is
an
affirmative
defense.
the
trial
court
stated
to
counsel
before
submitting
interrogatory
number
one
that
he
was
purposely
refraining
from
asking
the
jury
to
decide
the
employee
issue,
which
he
considered
one
for
the
court.
this
is
what
the
trial
court
stated
at
page
169
a
of
the
record
in
commenting
on
interrogatory
number
one.
you
notice
there
i
refrain
from
saying
just
what
his
status
is.
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
to
have
the
jury
find
whether
he
was
employed
or
not.
i
think
that
is
a
question
for
the
law,
we
might
have
to
look
at
that
afterwards,
it
depends
on
what
you
think
of
it.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
169
a
of
the
record
mr.
justice.
the
respondent
asked
of
a
judge
for
a
binding
instruction,
that
if
the
jury
found
that
an
emergency
existed,
which
justified
schroyer
in
hiring
an
assistant,
the
verdict
must
be
for
the
respondent.
the
respondent
thus
tried
to
have
the
court
bind
the
jury
without
instructing
the
jury
to
consider
or
decide
whose
employee
ormsbee
was
or
whether
the
employment
was
in
the
regular
course
of
the
respondent's
business.
when
this
request
for
a
binding
instruction
was
refused,
the
respondent
made
no
effort
to
obtain
an
instruction
which
would
have
permitted
the
jury
rather
than
the
court
to
determine
the
employment
status
question.
since
this
is
important
it
should
be
stressed
that
the
jury
was
never
asked
to
consider
whether
ormsbee
was
respondent's
employee?
further
the
respondent
made
no
request
that
the
statutory
language,
regular
course
of
business
ever
be
presented
to
the
hearing
of
the
jury.
finally,
the
judge
was
not
asked
to
present
to
the
jury
any
language
equivalent
to
regular
course
of
business,
such
as
the
language
that
has
been
developed
in
the
pennsylvania
decisions
and
which
was
quoted
by
the
court
below.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
there
is
support
for
what
was
done
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
under
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
as
decided
by
the
byrd
case
of
the
last
session
of
this
court.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
drawing
of
the
necessary
inferences
from
the
facts
is
a
function
for
the
jury,
not
the
conclusion
of
law,
but
your
honor
the
question
of
labeling
the
proper
drawing
of
inferences,
which
is
a
jury
function,
cannot
be
assumed
by
the
court
by
calling
it
a
conclusion
of
law
or
a
question
of
law.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
jury
thus
found
that
ormsbee
was
not
a
trespasser.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
jury
was
not
asked
to
consider
or
decide
the
employee
question.
the
court
at
page
169
a
of
the
record
expressed
that
to
be
his
intent.
there
is
nothing
in
the
interrogatory
which
deals
with
regular
course
of
business
or
which
determines
these
employee
questions.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
they
found
that
he
was
properly
present
on
the
truck,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
no
it
would
not.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
drawing
of
these
inferences
as
to
whether
or
not
the
workman's
compensation
act
is
a
defense
seems
to
be
there
is
support
in
the
pennsylvania
cases
for
what
was
done
so
clearly
in
this
case.
we
are
not
arguing
that
this
court
was
wrong,
that
the
two
courts
below
were
wrong
in
their
application
of
pennsylvania
practice.
if
of
course
they
were
wrong
that
would
simply
make
the
error
more
grievous.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
see.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well
first
of
all
if
there
was
--
this
pennsylvania
practice
was
largely
derived
--
is
largely
as
far
as
i
can
see
derived
from
practice
before
the
compensation
board
itself,
where
the
compensation
board
might
make
a
finding
on
that
specific
point.
if
it
arose
in
a
negligence
case,
it
is
conceivable
that
this
issue
as
to
--
which
presents
a
direct
conflict,
based
on
a
conflict
of
testimony
could
be
put
to
the
jury.
but
it
certainly
was
not
here
and
generally
seems
to
be
just
decided
by
the
court,
as
we
have
shown
in
various
cases
we
have
cited.
they
simply
take
this
function
and
label
it
a
question
of
law
which
they
say
is
open
to
review,
all
of
which
is
compensation
board
language
and
decide
this
question
themselves.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
perhaps
that
is
what
he
was
doing,
but
he
was
simply
saying
from
the
very
start
of
this
record,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
anything
to
the
contrary
from
the
opening
page,
that
he
was
not
going
to
put
this
employment
question
to
the
jury,
that
it
was
a
question
as
he
put
it
a
question
of
the
law
for
the
court.
now
after
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
the
respondent
moved
for
judgment
n.o.v
or
for
a
new
trial
and
these
motions
were
denied.
and
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
relying
on
skinner,
a
secondary
treatise
on
the
pennsylvania
workman's
compensation
act,
dealing
with
state
court
practice
and
the
court
relied
on
skinner
for
its
right
to
determine
the
employee
issue
as
a
question
of
law,
which
it
stated
was
open
to
review.
as
you
can
see
in
a
federal
court
case
the
state
practice
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
open
to
review,
was
hardly
an
appropriate
thing
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
been
dealing
with.
now
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
defined
in
regular
course
of
business
as
depending
upon
whether
the
employment
was
an
ordinary
operation
of
the
respondent,
or
in
the
words
of
the
callahan
case
cited
by
the
court,
the
normal
operations,
which
regularly
constitute
the
business
of
the
employer.
but
the
court
surprisingly
concluded
that
since
ormsbee
was
on
the
truck,
by
virtue
of
the
emergency,
this
put
him
into
the
regular
business
of
the
defendant,
namely
transportation
of
goods
by
truck.
now
this
court
held
in
byrd,
that
in
a
federal
diversity
case,
the
jury
decides
the
fact
question
of
whether
there
was
employment
status
under
the
under
workman's
compensation
act,
and
we
have
the
same
question
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
state
practice
and
labeled
the
question
of
ormsbee
status
a
question
of
law
and
under
byrd
state
practice
simply
did
not
apply.
the
jury
made
a
special
finding
in
answer
to
interrogatory
one
that
ormsbee
was
properly
present
on
the
truck,
and
trial
court
had
submitted
this
question
as
he
stated,
both
before
he
did
it
and
after
he
did
it,
for
the
very
narrow
purpose
of
determining
whether
ormsbee
was
a
trespasser.
the
judge
carefully
informed
counsel
that
the
interrogatory
was
not
intended
to
present
the
employment
question
to
the
jury,
but
the
court
of
appeals
drew
inferences
to
find
that
respondent
was
ormsbee's
employer
and
that
the
employment
was
in
regular
course.
now
we
do
not
deny
that
the
pennsylvania
practice
readily
allows
the
drawing
of
such
an
inference
as
i've
already
said,
where
the
fact
issue
is
one
of
statuary
coverage.
the
state
cases
cited
in
our
brief
show
that
the
court,
with
facility,
seems
to
translate
into
and
label
the
drawings
of
these
inferences,
labels
it
questions
of
law,
but
the
pennsylvania
practice
is
certainly
not
basic
for
the
statutory
scheme
and
so
the
byrd
decision
maybe
readily
applied.
now
the
respondent
in
its
brief
presents
many
ancillary
contentions,
but
the
clear
thrust
of
its
effort
to
distinguish
byrd
is
its
assertion
that
somehow
the
employment
question
was
fully
presented
to
the
jury
and
was
decided
by
the
jury
itself
in
the
respondent's
favor.
now
since
the
jury
never
heard
of
the
compensation
act
as
acclaimed
bar
to
the
cause
of
action,
never
heard
of
it,
the
respondent
obviously
has
great
difficulty
in
arguing
that
the
jury
could
have
decided
anything
with
respect
to
the
question,
but
concretely
the
jury
was
never
told
of
a
statutory
standard
that
the
employment
must
be
in
the
regular
course
of
the
respondent's
business
in
order
to
come
within
the
coverage
of
the
compensation
act.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
and
that
is
what
the
court
--
that
is
what
the
respondent
has
done
in
an
effort
to
supply
the
omission.
the
respondent
fastens
on
these
words
in
defendant's
interests,
which
appears
in
interrogatory
number
one
as
mr.
justice
whitaker
read
it.
the
respondent
asserts
that
these
words
in
defendant's
interests
are
the
equivalent
of
regular
course
of
business.
and
from
this
it
would
follow,
according
to
the
respondent,
that
the
jury
made
the
determination
that
ormsbee
was
employee
in
the
regular
course
of
business
because
his
presence
on
the
truck
was
in
the
defendant's
interest.
now
there
is
no
support
whatsoever
in
the
pennsylvania
cases
or
in
the
decision
below
for
this
newly
advanced
contention
that
regular
course
of
business
and
the
defendant's
interests
are
equivalent
expressions.
in
the
leading
callahan
case
which
was
relied
on
by
the
court
below,
the
repair
of
machinery
belonging
to
the
employer,
was
held
not
to
be
in
the
regular
course
of
a
business
of
the
employer,
although
it
was
clearly
in
the
employer's
interest,
couldn't
have
proceeded
with
his
operation
without
the
repair.
and
in
the
rocco
case
again
relied
on
by
the
court
below,
the
repair
of
the
employer's
restaurant
ceiling
was
held
to
be
not
in
the
regular
course
of
the
employer's
business,
although
again
it
obviously
was
in
the
defendant's
interest.
if
everything
in
the
employer's
interests
were
held
to
be
in
the
regular
course
of
the
employer's
business,
then
clearly
nothing
would
be
excluded,
and
so
we
think
it
can
be
stated
with
assurance
that
the
employment
issue
was
in
fact
not
determined
by
the
jury.
now
the
two
questions
as
to
ormsbee's
employment
status,
both
of
which
had
to
be
decided
in
the
favor
of
the
respondent,
were
on
the
record
factual
questions
upon
which
a
jury
could
have
drawn
inferences
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
first
as
to
the
question
of
who
was
the
employer,
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
fidler
the
lessor
maintained
active
control
over
the
repair
and
maintenance
of
his
own
equipment.
he
garaged
his
equipment,
he
arranged
for
its
ordinary
repair
by
an
independent
contractor,
even
when
the
truck
was
on
the
road,
fidler
made
special
trips
to
supply
the
driver
with
replacement
tires,
he
hired
the
driver.
he
instructed
the
driver
as
to
the
garages
to
be
used
on
the
road
for
making
emergency
repairs
and
he
paid
the
repair
bills.
he
even
told
schroyer
whether
to
--
whether
he
could
proceed
in
bad
weather.
when
schroyer
hired
ormsbee
in
the
tavern,
he
did
so
because
of
the
eminent
breakdown
of
the
equipment,
he
felt
he
might
need
help.
both
fidler
and
the
respondent
had
a
policy
of
not
permitting
riders
on
the
truck
and
so
the
trial
judge
was
at
first
quite
dubious
about
ormsbee's
status
as
an
authorized
person
on
the
truck,
but
he
stated
that
he
had
been
shaken
in
his
initial
impression
by
fidler's
testimony,
that
he
authorized
his
driver
while
on
the
road
to
engage
necessary
repair
and
other
services
without
consulting
him.
so
it
was
with
a
view
toward
getting
help
as
to
tasks
that
fidler
had
kept
under
his
control
that
ormsbee
was
hired.
this
pertained
to
the
repair
of
equipment
that
belonged
to
fidler
and
did
not
pertain
to
the
driving
of
the
truck
for
the
transportation
of
goods,
at
least
a
jury
could
have
so
found.
now
second,
on
the
assumption
that
ormsbee
became
the
employee
of
the
respondent
could
a
jury
have
reasonably
concluded
that
he
was
not
engaged
in
the
regular
course
of
the
respondent's
business?
could
it
have
been
concluded
that
his
function
was
not
ordinary
or
normal,
but
to
the
contrary
was
extraordinary
or
abnormal?
we
believe
the
answer
is
obvious.
ormsbee
was
not
licensed
to
drive
a
motor
vehicle
in
pennsylvania.
he
was
not
hired
to
drive
a
motor
vehicle,
and
in
fact
he
did
not
drive
it.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
driver
was
disabled
and
an
emergency
substitute
driver
had
to
be
found
to
take
this
place.
ormsbee
was
not
engaged
in
the
transportation
of
goods,
and
he
patently
could
perform
no
function
with
respect
to
the
load.
the
truck
contained
36,000
pounds
of
steel.
in
the
event
of
a
breakdown,
it
hardly
needed
protection
while
repairs
were
being
undertaken.
if
a
breakdown
had
occurred
presumably
ormsbee
would
have
helped
in
a
mechanical
or
a
related
way
in
meeting
the
trouble
which
led
to
his
engagement
in
the
first
place.
his
contemplated
services
were
the
prospective
handling
of
broken
down
equipment
owned
by
fidler.
now
even
the
ordinary
repair
and
maintenance
of
the
truck
was
not
handled
by
fidler
and
certainly
not
by
the
respondent.
it
was
contracted
out,
this
was
not
even
an
ordinary
function
of
fidler,
but
certainly
the
testimony
shows
how
far
removed
from
ordinary
or
normal
was
the
transportation
of
ormsbee
himself
in
the
emergency.
ormsbee's
transportation
was
so
extraordinary
that
the
respondent
was
to
insist
throughout
the
trial
that
he
was
a
mere
trespasser.
a
reasonable
inference
is
that
in
respondent's
normal
operation,
it
provided
neither
roving
mechanics,
riding
assistants,
nor
$25
a
trip
short-haul
companions,
and
since
a
jury
could
have
reasonably
decided
one
or
both
of
these
factual
issues
in
petitioner's
favor,
it
was
erroneous
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
draw
its
own
conclusions
in
reliance
on
pennsylvania
state
practice.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well,
first
of
all
i
don't
think
it
can't
be
read
that
way.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well,
it's
clear
that
the
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
it's
very
clear
that
the
court
your
honor
stated
that
it
was
relying
on
pennsylvania
practice
as
to
the
function
that
it
was
to
perform
as
to
the
questions
that
were
open
for
review.
now
i
really
can't
believe
that
this
court
could
have
seriously
believed
that
in
defendant's
interests
were
equivalent
words
in
regular
course
of
business.
i
don't
think
that
was
within
the
realm
of
possibility
as
anything
was
in
the
court's
mind.
that
point
incidentally
was
not
argued
in
the
brief
of
opposition
to
certiorari,
it
came
up
rather
belatedly
in
response
to
our
brief
on
the
merits
for
the
first
time.
it
was
a
search
to
find
in
the
words
of
interrogatory
number
one,
something
that
was
not
there,
something
that
the
court
itself
decided
by
drawing
inferences
from
the
facts
of
record.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
it
decided
your
honor
that
the
function,
that
was
a
jury
function
to
determine
the
question
of
employment
status.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
it
was
a
workmen's
compensation
act
issue
as
is
this
one.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
in
the
byrd
case
it
was
not
put
to
the
jury.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
issue
was
not
put
to
the
jury.
it
was
taken
away
from
the
jury
as
you
may
recall.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
that
was
a
defense.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
that
was
a
defense
in
the
case.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
that
is
right.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
very
same
case.
we
have
what
is
conceded
to
be
an
affirmatively
defense
in
this
case.
it
was
conceded
and
you
will
see
that
thing
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
as
far
as
i
know
not.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
as
far
as
i
know
not.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
that
is
right,
that
is
right,
that
is
the
problem.
that's
precisely
the
problem.
that
you
have
--
that
the
respondent's
burden
here
in
trying
to
urge
you
to
find
words
somewhere,
some
concealed
meaning
in
some
of
these
words
like
in
defendant's
interest
to
supply
an
omission.
as
i've
said
as
far
as
the
jury
was
concerned
in
this
case
they
never
would
have
known
that
there
was
a
defense
for
the
workmen's
compensation
act,
and
so
it's
rather
hard
to
say
that
the
jury
could
have
decided
anything
with
respect
to
the
issue.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
on
proper
instructions
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is,
that
has
been
decided
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
it
is
the
function
and
the
practice
in
the
federal
courts
as
you
have
said
in
many
a
case,
that
there
is
a
question
for
example
of
what
is
an
efficient
brake,
which
is
the
statutory
language
establishing
a
cause
of
action,
that
the
jury
is
to
be
instructed
fully
on
what
is
the
test
of
an
efficient
brake
and
then
upon
such
an
instructions
the
jury
is
to
determine.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well,
whether
a
man
comes
within
the
category
is
what
you
have
here.
the
cases
mr.
justice
that
we
cite
at
page
17
of
our
main
brief
show
that
all
questions
of
this
kind
what
is
the
course
of
employment,
whether
a
person
is
a
member
of
a
crew,
whether
there
is
an
efficient
handbrake,
all
these
questions
are
to
be
put
to
the
fact
finder
whether
it
be
a
board
or
the
jury,
to
be
resolved
by
the
jury.
so
in
this
case,
the
jury
should
have
been
told
about
reasonable
course
of
business,
should
have
been
instructed
that
this
means
the
normal
operation
which
regularly
constitutes
the
business
of
the
employer
and
the
jury
should
have
been
asked
to
find.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
quite
see
your
problem.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well
we
don't
have
the
case
of
whether
the
issue
would
be
res
judicata
because
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes
i
would
think
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yeah,
we
don't
have
that
case
here,
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
function
for
the
court,
i
mean
for
the
jury.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well
i
don't
know
the
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
the
case
would
lie,
but
that
is
not
our
case.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
well
if
there
was
some
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
some
sort
of
a
substantive
right
–-
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
yes,
that
contention
incidentally
has
not
even
been
advanced
by
the
respondent.
if
there
was
anything
peculiar
about
the
pennsylvania
law,
such
as
in
the
tyce
case,
that
would
be
fela
situation,
which
would
require
holding
that
this
a
matter
of
substance.
we
cover
that
in
our
brief
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
there
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
the
pennsylvania
law
as
to
practice
and
certainly
as
you
point
out,
is
certainly
not
that
clear,
but
i
might
add
again,
that
if
the
two
courts
below
simply
misconstrued
a
pennsylvania
practice
entirely,
a
position
that
we
do
not
urge,
but
if
this
court
were
to
so
find,
that
would
simply,
simply
make
the
error
even
more
serious,
because
not
only
would
they
have
misconstrued
pennsylvania
law
but
they
would
then
have
misapplied
pennsylvania
law
as
so
misconstrued
in
a
diversity
case
to
which
it
had
no
application.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
would
think
you
would
have
to
find
that
in
order
to
say
that
it
was
substantive,
you
would
have
to
find
some
statutory
scheme
that
expressed
an
intent
in
a
workmen's
compensation
act,
to
deal
with
the
jury
function
where
the
workmen's
compensation
question
comes
up
only
collaterally,
which
would
be
quite
a
surprising
development,
because
the
basic
concentration
of
the
workmen's
compensation
act
itself
would
not
be
on
the
question
of
what
is
done
when
the
issue
comes
up
collaterally
in
a
tort
action,
but
what
is
the
scope
of
review
that
should
be
prevailing
from
a
decision
of
the
administrative
board
itself,
when
that
case
is
taken
into
court.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i'm
not
trying
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i'm
not
trying
to
minimize
it.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
it
is
not
the
direct
review
mr.
justice
of
an
administrative
board
that
comes
into
the
case
as
an
affirmative
defense
in
an
ordinary
tort
case
and
to
that
extent
it
is
--
the
issue
does
arise
collaterally.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
workmen's
compensation
act
itself
in
pennsylvania,
as
far
as
i
know
in
most
states,
simply
does
not
concern
itself
with
the
question
of
who
decides
what
issue
in
the
tort
case,
but
is
concerned
only
with
what
is
decided
by
the
board
and
what
the
scope
of
review
should
be
from
the
board
decision.
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
think
–-
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
harry
l.
shniderman
i
think
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
say
that
in
some
case,
that
there
is
a
policy
of
a
state,
which
is
so
strong
that
it
should
overcome
the
policy
in
federal
diversity
cases,
the
fact
issues
are
decided
by
the
jury.
so
that
would
pose
the
clear
question
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
whether
any
such
state
policy
could
prevail,
a
question
which
this
court
did
not
feel
compelled
to
reach
in
the
byrd
case,
but
which
under
the
suggestion
you
would
have
to
reach
in
this
case.
