justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
decision
of
the
--
what
did
that
decide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
abstractly
or
with
relation
to
workmen's
compensation
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
the
byrd
case
was
the
workmen's
compensation
issue
put
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
asked
to
be
put
to
the
jury?
was
the
case
litigated
as
a
workmen's
compensation
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
litigation
was
about
the
workmen's
compensation
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
and
the
question
was
the
jury's
relation,
the
jury's
function
in
relation
to
a
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
in
this
case
is
this
same
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
anything
said
about
the
workmen's
compensation
act
in
the
byrd
case
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
mentioned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
say
the
issue
is
that
what
is
the
status
of
employment
under
workmen's
compensation,
that
claim,
that
must
be
put
to
the
jury
actually
i
should
think
the
jury
would
be
told
something
about
it.
so
far
as
--
i
have
just
for
the
first
time
read
the
charge
of
the
jury
and
you
couldn't
tell
from
that
the
workmen's
compensation
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
--
and
where
do
you
go
from
there
in
jump
to
the
conclusion
or
going
to
the
conclusion,
that
therefore
that
issue
is
not
on
under
pennsylvania
law,
a
part
of
the
statutory
limitation
or
restriction
or
right,
call
it
what
you
will,
which
is
--
in
other
jury's
business.
the
scope
of
a
state
statute,
is
that
to
be
left
to
a
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
applying
it
yes,
but
as
to
whether
you're
within
or
without
a
state
statute
is
that
a
jury
question,
even
a
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
different
thing
as
to
the
state
is,
that
a
state
chooses
to
define
for
which
it
does
or
doesn't
give
its
own
state
law
relief,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
brake
is
one
thing,
but
whether
or
not
who
comes
within
the
category,
i
can
see
determining
whether
a
man
comes
within
a
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
the
category
is,
is
not
for
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
suppose
under
state
law
that's
to
be
done
by
an
administrative
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
then
bring
a
diversity
suit,
that
means
you
can
try
that
in
litigation
rather
than
the
administrative
agency
before
the
jury,
is
that
your
contention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
under
state
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
a
man
is
within
or
without,
must
be
determined
by
an
administrative
agency,
does
diversity
jurisdiction,
i'm
asking
and
this
is
(inaudible),
does
diversity
jurisdiction
permit
or
imply
that
in
this
regard,
administrative
determination
of
these
questions
and
bring
it
before
a
jury
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
talking
about
res
judicata.
i'm
taking
about
the
process
for
determining
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
they
should
come
within
or
without
a
state
law,
the
state
law
says
you
must
bring
it
before
an
administrative
agency,
if
you've
got
diversity
can
you
disregard
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
is,
whether
the
(inaudible)
whether
it's
for
jury
or
for
court,
if
a
state
says
we
are
going
to
give
certain
relief
and
that's
exclusive
relief
in
this
state,
and
it
must
be
fought
out
before
an
administrative
tribunal,
can
you
have
diversity
transfer
it
to
a
court
proceeding
and
a
jury
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
pennsylvania
law,
the
word
practice
is
also
(inaudible)
tack
on
(inaudible)
with
the
game
of
labels,
those
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
laws
meet
all
questions
arising
in
under
workmen's
compensation
law,
those
proceedings
in
(inaudible)
exclusively
to
the
court,
no
jury
at
all,
not
the
distribution
of
function
between
the
two,
but
deal
with
it
entirely
through
court.
would
you
call
that
just
pennsylvania
practice
for
purposes
of
the
byrd
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
why
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
see
you
why
you
minimize
a
defense
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
pennsylvania
law
is
something
collateral.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
an
ordinary
tort
case,
what
you
are
dealing
with
is
a
policy
of
the
state
that
an
ordinary
tort
case
should
not
be
subjected
to
ordinary
tort
law,
but
should
be
subjected
to
the
insurance
principles,
workmen's
compensation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
from
that
one
can
derive
a
policy
those
issues
should
be
determined,
those
rights
should
be
determined
in
a
certain
way,
rather
than
some
other
way
â€“-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
of
the
conflict.
there
is
certainly
conflict
of
the
law
or
of
the
policy
in
law,
between
letting
ordinary
tort
law
govern
the
jury
and
letting
workmen's
compensation
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
collateral
(inaudible)
that
goes
to
the
very
root
of
the
policy
of
workmen's
compensation
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
isn't
that
the
real
question
that
you
supplant
tort
law
by
different
concepts
of
law
(inaudible)
