justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
shniderman
what
workmen's
compensation
act
(inaudible)
for
this
respondent
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
you
in
answer
to
justice
harlan
the
question
of
whether
ormsbee
was
(inaudible)
pennsylvania
cases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
purport
of
my
inquiry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
fault,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
is
this,
if
there
is
an
issue
in
the
case
whether
ormsbee
is
an
employee
of
fidler
or
of
the
respondent,
if
this
case
were
tried
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
by
whom
would
that
issue
be
determined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suggest
on
this
record
that
judge
wilson
may
have
said
that
there
is
no
issue
on
the
employment
in
the
case
for
the
purposes
of
the
workmen's
compensation
act?
so
it's
on
the
record
if
ormsbee
was
an
employee
of
anyone,
he
could
only
be
an
employee
of
fidler,
in
which
case
the
defense
in
workman's
compensation
would
not
have
been
available
to
the
respondent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
drawing
a
distinction
between
defendant's
interests
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
course
of
the
defendants'
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
may
i
just
interrupt
you
right
there?
was
not
schroyer
in
fact
hired
by
fidler
as
fidler's
driver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
fidler's
driver.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
may
i
ask
further,
not
only
was
he
employed
by
fidler,
but
was
there
not
testimony
that
mr.
shniderman
referred
to
that
indicate
that
schroyer
in
his
operation
of
the
truck
took
his
instructions
from
fidler,
for
example
he
laid
up
overnight
night
as
i
recall
at
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
fidler's
orders.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
went
there
for
repairs
to
certain
repair
shops
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
fidler's
orders.
and
there
was
also
--
was
it
fidler's
testimony
that
he
authorized
schroyer
to
employ
services
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
--
what
puzzles
about
this
is,
if
in
fact
there
was
evidence
upon
which
a
conclusion
of
employment
by
fidler
rather
than
by
aetna
is
required,
would
the
workman's
compensation
act
of
pennsylvania
be
a
defense
for
aetna?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
driver
i
gather
refers
to
schroyer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
it
still
doesn't
--
that's
not
a
concession
that
it
might
not
have
been
necessary
in
fidler's
interest,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
there
some
merit
in
mr.
shniderman's
position
that
the
fact
that
he
--
it
may
have
been
necessary
to
employ
him
in
aetna's
interest,
doesn't
establish
that,
that
employment
was
in
the
regular
course
of
aetna's
business
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i've
taken
too
much
of
your
time,
but
may
i
ask
one
more
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
contemporaneously
with
this
litigation
there
was
pending
a
workman's
compensation
petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
that
aetna
has
denied
that
the
deceased
was
an
employee
of
aetna,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
is
that
proceeding
just
stayed
pending
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
this
also
true
mr.
illig,
the
lessor
who
was
fidler
had
an
interest
here
did
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
mean
this
route
as
i
understand
it
was
--
lessor
was
the
owner
of
the
truck
and
he
leased
the
truck
with
driver
to
aetna.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
lessor
he
had
a
business
interest
in
having
that
truck
traverse
that
100
odd
miles
didn't
he?
it
may
have
been
on
a
delivery
on
behalf
of
aetna,
but
wasn't
that
also
an
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
can
understand
that
it
might
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
defendant's
interest,
but
does
not
it
fairly
follow
that
it
was
in
the
regular
course
of
business,
that
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
much
is
true
isn't
it,
that
as
the
holder,
you
were
the
holder
of
the
icc
certificates
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understand
it,
even
though
you
exercise
no
control
over
the
operation
of
the
rig
itself,
nevertheless
as
to
reliability
to
a
third
party
by
reason
of
any
misconduct
with
a
negligence
or
otherwise
of
the
lessor,
then
even
though
you
reserve
no
rights
of
control
liability
would
follow
because
the
lessor
was
liable
isn't
that
so,
as
a
holder
of
the
icc
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
don't
you
think
we
have
that
problem
involved
in
this
case
at
all?
