mr.
william
f.
illig
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
seeks
a
reversal
really
on
the
basis
of
one
decision
of
this
court,
the
case
of
byrd
versus
the
blue
ridge
cooperative,
in
which
the
majority
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
brennan
last
year.
and
i
just
like
to
take
a
half
a
second
to
show
that
the
bryd
case
was
completely
different
from
this
in
the
whole
situation
so
that
there
won't
be
any
confusion
in
the
court's
mind,
because
in
the
first
place
in
the
byrd
case
the
only
evidence
of
statutory
employment,
which
was
the
issue
there,
was
presented
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
and
all
of
it
was
withdrawn
from
the
consideration
of
the
jury,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
statutory
employee.
here
on
the
other
hand,
all
of
the
evidence
of
petitioner's
emergency
employment
was
brought
out
by
petitioner
as
part
of
his
own
case
and
it
was
not
only
all
submitted
to
the
jury,
but
it
was
submitted
in
the
form
of
a
special
interrogatory
presented
by
the
court,
which
the
jury
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
the
words
of
judge
goodrich,
“thus
the
matter
turns
in
the
final
analysis
on
a
question
of
fact,
that
is
a
sufficient
state
of
emergency
to
justify
the
enlisting
of
another
to
help
assist
in
the
business
to
be
done.
the
jury's
finding
is
a
forthright
answer
to
a
forthright
question.
the
trial
judge
who
heard
all
the
testimony
was
satisfied
--
satisfied
with
it.
we
do
not
think
on
this
state
of
the
record
that
we
would
be
justified
in
setting
it
aside.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
case
adopted
the
jury's
finding
of
fact
and
applied
applicable
principles
of
pennsylvania
law
and
held
that
petitioner's
remedies
were
in
workmen's
compensation.
now
it's
been
said
that
the
whole
defense
of
workmen's
compensation
was
an
affirmative
defense
of
the
defendant,
but
i
think
and
i
believe
you
will
agree
when
you
study
the
whole
record,
that
a
very
peculiar
situation
developed
in
this
case,
which
was
responsible
for
petitioner
developing
the
whole
matter
of
the
emergency
employment
and
not
as
in
the
byrd
case,
where
the
defendant
sought
to
show
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
statutory
employee.
when
you
see
the
complaint
you
will
find
that
it
was
not
drawn
in
the
terse
federal
notice
type
of
pleading,
but
instead
it
was
in
a
the
detailed
form
followed
under
pennsylvania
practice
and
there
it
was
alleged
simply
that
ormsbee
the
decedent
was
a
guest
passenger
of
the
defendant
invited
to
ride
by
schroyer
the
driver.
there
was
no
reference
to
willful
or
wanton
conduct,
there
was
no
word
about
emergency
hiring,
but
at
pretrial
for
the
first
time
the
petitioner
became
aware
that
workmen's
compensation
was
going
to
come
into
this
case,
you
will
find
that
mentioned
at
page
11
of
the
pretrial
notes,
and
petitioner
also
became
aware
that
if
he
were
merely
an
invitee
of
the
driver
or
a
guest
passenger,
he
would
be
a
trespasser
as
to
the
defendant
aetna
freight
lines
for
this
reason.
mr.
william
f.
illig
pretrial
notes.
mr.
william
f.
illig
no
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor
that
is
not
printed
in
the
record
there.
the
pretrial
notes
i
simply
said
that's
were
workmen's
compensation
first
came
into
the
picture.
so
what
i
was
going
to
say
was,
he
knew
he
would
be
a
trespasser
as
to
the
defendant
aetna
for
this
reason
and
this
is
important.
schroyer
the
driver,
and
i
think
it's
already
been
commented
upon
by
mr.
schneider,
had
been
forbidden
to
take
any
rides.
there
was
a
no
rider
sign
on
the
windshield
of
the
truck.
the
icc
regulations
forbade
riders
under
those
circumstances,
therefore
if
he
was
a
simply
rider
or
guest
passenger
of
the
driver,
he
would
be
a
trespasser
as
to
aetna
and
he
couldn't
recover
on
the
basis
of
ordinary
negligence,
but
would
have
to
show
willful
or
wanton
misconduct,
which
under
pennsylvania
law
means
a
conscious
disregard
of
known
danger.
so
the
petitioner
tried
his
case
on
two
new
theories,
and
i'm
bringing
this
out
not
because
there
was
any
objection
to
it
on
the
behalf
of
the
respondent
at
the
trial,
but
to
give
the
background.
first,
that
if
ormsbee
the
decedent
were
a
trespasser,
the
defendant
aetna
was
guilty
of
willful
or
wanton
misconduct
even
though
that
hadn't
been
alleged
in
the
complaint,
but
it
had
been
brought
out
at
the
pretrial.
secondly
and
more
important
ormsbee
was
an
emergency
employee
of
the
defendant
aetna.
now,
this
is
important
too.
at
that
time
the
petitioner
thought
he
was
on
perfectly
safe
ground
in
bringing
the
matter
of
emergency
employment
into
the
case
as
part
of
his
own
proof.
mr.
william
f.
illig
there
was,
they
found
there
was
wanton
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
although
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
meet
that
point
because
of
the
disposition
on
the
first,
because
we
had
contended
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
of
wanton
misconduct
here
to
have
submitted
the
issue
to
the
jury
under
established
pennsylvania
law,
since
there
wasn't
any
showing
of
a
known
disregard
or
conscious
disregard
of
known
danger,
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
defective
brakes.
so
as
i
say,
they
proceeded
to
show
emergency
employment.
for
this
reason
they
thought
they
were
safe.
that
the
petitioner
or
rather
ormsbee
could
not
be
a
statutory
employee
of
the
defendant
aetna
under
pennsylvania
law
because
the
accident
didn't
occur
on
the
premises.
but
as
judge
goodrich
pointed
out
in
his
opinion,
what
petitioner
overlooked
was
section
104
of
the
pennsylvania
workmen's
compensation
act,
whereby
emergency
employees
are
included
within
the
definition
of
employee.
so
then
the
petitioner
proceeded
to
develop
all
of
the
facts
surrounding
how
ormsbee
came
to
be
on
the
truck
instead
of
simply
showing
that
an
accident
happened,
the
truck
went
over
the
embankment
and
both
men
were
killed.
he
showed
that
ormsbee
was
hired
for
$25
by
schroyer
as
an
assistant
to
help
him
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
which
he
was
unable
to
perform
for
the
balance
of
the
trip.
the
emergency
was
that
schroyer
had,
had
brake
trouble
and
mechanical
trouble
and
expected
more,
and
he
said
he
needed
someone
to
help
him
to
carry
on
for
the
balance
of
the
trip.
this
was
part
of
the
plaintiff's
proof,
and
this
is
also
a
very
significant
circumstance
which
hasn't
been
commented
on.
the
plaintiff's
own
proof
showed,
that
ormsbee
the
defendant
helper
or
assistant
was
on
this
truck
not
for
just
a
couple
of
minutes,
not
in
a
rescue
operation
or
anything
of
the
sort,
but
for
a
distance
of
over
100
mile
from
100
to
125
miles
during
which
this
time
this
truck
and
its
cargo
were
being
moved
towards
its
destination
and
it
was
over
a
period
of
five
or
six
hours,
he
was
riding
there
as
a
helper
before
this
accident
happened.
that
is
a
very
important
circumstance.
again
it
was
proved
by
the
petitioner's
own
evidence.
the
only
dispute
at
the
trial
centered
around
one
thing,
the
respondent
took
the
position
that
the
emergency,
that
the
petitioner
was
contending
was
not
the
type
of
emergency,
which
under
pennsylvania
substantive
law
would
have
given
the
driver
implied
authority
to
hire
an
assistant,
and
now
at
the
--
mr.
william
f.
illig
yes.
mr.
william
f.
illig
no,
i
was
just
going
to
come
to
that
and
i
want
to
say
that
right
now,
because
as
you
know
the
first
finding
which
is
the
crucial
one,
the
controlling
one,
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
and
used
it
as
the
basis
of
its
opinion
in
applying
applicable
pennsylvania
law
was
about
the
emergency.
the
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
this
--
it
did
not
follow
from
this
finding
that
he
was
an
employee
of
aetna
the
defendant
rather
than
of
fidler,
and
i
believe
that
is
the
question
your
honor
is
asking.
mr.
william
f.
illig
number
one
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
complaint
it
was
alleged
that
schroyer
the
driver
was
the
servant,
agent
and
employee
of
the
defendant
aetna.
aetna
was
the
only
defendant
sued.
number
two,
the
only
evidence
of
the
hiring
which
was
brought
out
by
the
petitioner
concerned
extra
judicial
statements
of
the
dead
driver
schroyer
maybe
in
this
tavern
at
waterford
to
two
people
in
connection
with
hiring
of
ormsbee.
this
was
objected
to
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
at
the
trial
because
it
was
hearsay
as
to
the
defendant
aetna,
but
if
you
look
at
the
record
at
page
36
a,
you
find
that
the
plaintiff's
--
petitioner's
counsel
mr.
gornall
urged
in
support
of
the
admission
of
that
very
evidence,
that
it
was
statements
made
by
schroyer
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
now
obviously
it
couldn't
be
in
the
course
of
his
employment
for
the
--
for
fidler,
a
third
party.
mr.
william
f.
illig
he
was
hired
by
filder
that
is
true.
mr.
william
f.
illig
as
fidler's
driver,
but
he
was
under
the
control
of
the
defendant
aetna
which
alone
had
the
icc
certificate.
mr.
william
f.
illig
that's
true.
mr.
william
f.
illig
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
illig
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
illig
that
is
true,
that
was
in
the
testimony
that
in
response
to
a
question
put
by
the
court,
as
to
whether
fidler
authorized
him
to
employ
services
and
the
defendant's
counsel
didn't
hear
the
question
and
he
said,
i
didn't
get
that
your
honor,
he
said,
did
you
say
was
the
answer
servants
or
services
and
the
answer
was
only
services.
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
fidler
in
anyway
authorized
schroyer
to
employee
any
servants
or
assistants.
mr.
william
f.
illig
no
it
would
not.
mr.
william
f.
illig
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
would,
but
i
--
because
i
believe
that
same
point
was
involved
in
the
byrd
case,
he
had
already
received
workman's
compensation
from
his
immediate
employer,
but
bear
this
in
mind
your
honor,
at
page
174
a
in
connection
with
this
very
point.
when
they
are
talking
about
this
first
interrogatory
that's
going
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
note
what
mr.
knox
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
said,
made
it
reasonably
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
defendant's
interests,
namely
the
hirer,
defendant's
interest
not
driver's
interests,
and
then
if
you
get
over
here
to
page
184
a.
mr.
william
f.
illig
schroyer,
correct.
mr.
william
f.
illig
i
believe
it
is,
because
the
very
first
--
the
wording
of
the
first
interrogatory,
the
first
interrogatory
said
nothing
about
fidler,
you
find
that
an
unforeseen
contingency
arose
which
made
it
reasonably
necessary
for
the
protection
of
defendant's
interest,
not
fidler's
interests,
that
the
driver
charles
schroyer
engaged
the
decedent
norman
ormsbee.
i'd
like
to
point
this
out
further
your
honor
that
under
established
pennsylvania
law
the
restatement
section
79
which
is
referred
to
by
judge
goodrich
and
the
pennsylvania
cases,
if
there
is
the
factual
situation
where
a
driver
has
implied
authority
to
hire
an
assistant
for
the
protection
of
his
--
in
the
furtherance
of
the
defendant's
interest,
that's
the
employer,
and
that
emergency
exists,
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
person
employed
becomes
the
servant
of
the
master.
in
other
words
once
there
is
the
finding
and
here
the
specific
question
was
asked,
fidler
was
not
in
this
lawsuit.
the
question
was
asked
do
you
find
that
an
unforeseen
contingency
arose
which
made
it
reasonably
necessary
for
him
to
employ
him
in
furtherance
of
the
defendant's
interest
and
they
said
yes
to
this
question
specifically.
mr.
william
f.
illig
we're
coming
to
the
regular
course
of
business,
and
i'll
take
that
up
right
now,
but
before
i
leave
your
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
you
will
look
over
here
also
at
184
a
in
the
court's
charge,
this
is
--
this
bears
directly
on
the
fact
too
that
he
is
the
employee
of
the
defendant.
the
court
says
it
is
a
rule,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
it
is
a
rule
universally
recognized
that
the
relation
of
master
and
servant
cannot
be
imposed
upon
a
person
without
his
consent
express
or
implied.
it
is
upon
this
exception
to
the
general
rule
which
is
quite
as
well
settled
as
the
general
rule
itself
that
the
plaintiff
relies
in
this
case
to
establish
the
relation
of
master
and
servant
under
the
evidence.
now
notice
what
he
says,
“the
exception
of
the
servant
may
engage
and
assist
in
the
case
of
emergency
where
he
is
unable
to
perform
the
work
alone,
but
you
have
to
find
an
emergency
on
the
road
confronting
schroyer
that
night,
that
he
couldn't
go
alone
and
there
was
reasonable
--
in
his
opinion
and
it
was
to
be
expected
in
interests
of
the
employer
that
he
had
the
implied
authority,
he
did
have
the
power
to
engage
an
assistant
and
engaged
mr.
ormsbee
to
go
along
with
him
to
complete
the
trip.”
the
only
employer
that
the
court
again
was
referring
to
was
aetna
who
was
the
only
defendant
sued.
mr.
william
f.
illig
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
illig
that
was
filed
before
the
trail
began
and
it
is
still
pending.
mr.
william
f.
illig
they
have
denied
that
they
were
an
employee
of
aetna
and
i
might
say
that
in
that
plain
petition
they
filed
against
fidler
and
against
aetna
and
against
schroyer,
in
other
words
they
cover
the
waterfront,
there
was
a
pro-forma
denial
in
view
of
that.
mr.
william
f.
illig
that
was
simply
stayed
and
it's
still
open.
now
you
have
asked
the
next
very
important
question
mr.
justice
brennan
and
that
is
did
it
follow
the
jury's
finding
that
he
was
in
the
regular
course
of
the
defendant
aetna's
business.
i'd
like
to
point
out
first
of
all
that
there
was
nothing
that
your
honor
said
in
the
byrd
case
to
the
effect
that
has
been
argued
here
that
the
statutory
language
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
in
that
case,
you
writing
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
have
the
factual
elements
of
the
defense
submitted
to
the
jury.
following
the
argument
of
mr.
shniderman
it
would
likewise
have
been
necessary
here
to
submit
the
question
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
the
hiring
was
for
valuable
consideration,
because
the
words
say
that,
the
words
of
the
act,
and
yet
it
was
conceded
that
he
hired
him
for
$25.
now
the
questions
come
in
is,
do
we
say
that
this
was
the
regular
course
of
business
only
because
of
the
use
of
the
words
in
the
furtherance
of
defendant's
interest.
my
answer
to
that
is
an
unequivocal
no.
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
answer
of
the
jury
to
this
special
interrogatory
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
court's
instructions
and
explanation
as
required
by
federal
rule
49b,
and
also
several
cases
recently
decided
by
the
third
circuit
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
rule
in
other
circuits
to
the
contrary,
to
the
effect
that
a
special
finding
must
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
instructions
given
by
the
court.
we
say
that
this
was
a
finding
that
it
was
in
the
regular
course
of
the
defendant
aetna's
business
because
the
circumstances
were
such
as
to
require
the
hiring
by
schroyer
the
regular
driver
of
ormsbee
to
accompany
him
for
the
full
balance
of
the
trip
for
aetna
and
assist
him
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
which
he
was
unable
to
perform
alone.
all
of
that
is
impliedly
to
be
read
in
to
this
interrogatory
submitted
to
the
jury
because
of
the
specific
instructions
of
the
judge
and
if
you
will
look
at
184
a,
which
is
just
before
the
court
reads
the
interrogatory,
look
what
he
says,
in
explaining
it,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“unless
you
find
in
this
case,
that
is
emergency
arose
and
it
was
such
an
emergency
that
mr.
schroyer
was
unable
to
perform
it
alone,
that
is
his
duties
for
the
continuance
of
the
trip,
because
of
what
has
been
brought
out
here,
if
you
accept
that
proposition
that
the
brakes
were
bad
and
that
was
the
type
of
emergency
then
he
would
privileged
to
take
on
his
assistant
mr.
ormsbee.”
and
he
--
and
then
he
reads
the
interrogatory
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
he
says
the
words
unforeseen
contingency
mean
the
emergency
i
have
just
mentioned,
the
inability
of
mr.
schroyer
to
cope
with
it
alone.
if
you
think
it
reasonable
the
he
engaged
in
assistance,
why
you
may
answer
the
interrogatory
number
one.
my
point
in
that
regard
is
this,
regular
course
of
business
is
statutory
language.
it
is
not
defined
in
the
act.
it
is
then
the
subject
of
judicial
interpretation.
one
of
the
tests
that
has
been
applied,
the
factual
test
that
has
been
applied
by
our
pennsylvania
courts
throughout,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
smith
against
the
coal
company
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief
unfortunately,
in
86,
pennsylvania
superior,
hodger
against
walker
in
277
pa,
is
whether
a
person
who
is
hired,
is
hired
to
do
the
work
of
a
regular
employee
or
is
hired
to
assist
a
regular
employee,
those
are
factual
tests
of
regular
course
of
business.
the
regular
course
of
the
defendant's
business
as
judge
goodrich
said,
and
i
don't
think
it
can
been
controverted
is
transportation
of
goods
by
truck.
here
the
truck
moved
towards
its
destination
with
this
man
riding
as
a
helper
for
a
distance
of
over
a
100
miles
before
the
accident
happened,
over
a
period
of
five
or
six
hours,
he
was
there
as
an
assistant
ready
to
help
in
case
of
a
breakdown,
set
out
flares,
help,
summon
assistance,
protect
the
load,
all
these
were
argued
by
petitioner's
counsel
as
a
reason
for
the
emergency
and
permitting
of
the
hire
of
the
assistant.
mr.
william
f.
illig
no
--
mr.
william
f.
illig
right.
mr.
william
f.
illig
but
bear
in
mind,
and
we
come
back
to
the
fact
as
to
what
the
court
was
explaining
the
first
interrogatory
and
the
terms
of
terms
of
the
interrogatory
alone
itself
as
to
whether
they
should
answer
in
the
affirmative
or
negative
as
to
whether
it
was
in
furtherance
of
the
defendant's
interest.
mr.
william
f.
illig
yes.
it
was
in
the
regular
course
of
business,
in
the
light
of
the
court's
explanation,
that
if
can
--
mr.
william
f.
illig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
illig
i
don't
know
if
that
would
follow
in
the
case
of
negligence
of
the
lessor.
you
mean
as
far
as
third
party
is
concerned?
mr.
william
f.
illig
i
would
say
then
probably
yes,
because
the
courts
have
taken
the
position
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
the
holder
of
the
certificate
has
to
bear
responsibility.
mr.
william
f.
illig
no,
i
don't
your
honor,
and
one
point
apparently
i
haven't
made
clear
to
you
and
that
is
this.
all
of
this
evidence
of
the
hiring
was
admitted
against
aetna
on
the
basis
of
the
driver's
extra
judicial
statements
which
were
objected
to
as
to
hearsay.
now
i
would
like
to
know
how
the
petitioners
in
this
case
could
have
gotten
those
declarations
into
evidence
against
aetna
if
he
was
doing
the
hiring
for
fidler
a
third
party,
then
it
would
not
be
in
the
course
of
his
employer's
business
when
aetna
is
the
employer.
in
other
words,
if
would
have
been
the
rankest
hearsay
and
the
plaintiff
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
their
verdict.
that
is
one
of
the
most
crucial
things.
if
you
look
at
36
a
where
the
defendant
is
vehemently
objecting
to
this
evidence,
because
aetna
alone
is
sued
and
they
said
no
we
got
to
--
you
should
allow
this
because
these
were
declarations
made
in
the
course
of
his
employment
for
aetna
and
if
he
was
doing
it
for
fidler,
then
it
would
be
hearsay
as
to
aetna,
and
yet
that
is
result
of
the
your
honor's
conclusion
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
william
f.
illig
if
that
conclusion
would
follow,
but
it
is
not
the
only
conclusion
that
would
follow.
mr.
william
f.
illig
in
other
words
if
the
jury
had
answered
no,
there
was
no
such
emergency
your
honor,
then
he
would
have
been
a
trespasser
and
the
legal
principles
would
have
applied.
if
they
answer
yes
it
is
true
that
they
argue,
he
is
not
a
trespasser
but
naturally
no
employee
is
a
trespasser,
but
the
factual
basis
of
employment
was
presented
to
the
jury
and
they
passed
on
it.
this
point
i
think
must
be
stressed
before
the
court,
because
it
hasn't
--
i
haven't
brought
it
out,
that
at
no
time
heretofore
has
the
petitioner
ever
maintained
that
the
factual
basis
of
employment
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
jury.
they
have
argued
that
he
was
not
in
the
regular
course
of
employment
only
as
a
matter
of
law
and
only
after
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
did
they
come
into
this
court
for
the
first
time
and
say
the
factual
basis
of
employment
was
not
passed
on.
actually
this
case
was
tried
exactly
as
the
petitioners
wanted
it,
because
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
they
didn't
want
any
reference
to
workman's
compensation
in
the
case,
they
were
confident
that
the
trial
judge
was
going
to
uphold
their
contention.
in
fact
page
at
68
the
court
made
a
statement
with
regard
to
compensation.
he
says
at
the
bottom
of
68,
he
says
i
am
not
sure
how
they
are
going
to
rest
on
this
proposition
of
$25,
whether
he
was
employee
or
whether
he
wasn't.
i
think
that's
a
question
for
the
court,
don't
you?
mr.
gornall,
yes
sir.
in
other
words
whether
he
is
on
compensation
or
not
and
over
at
174
a
or
173
a,
here
is
another
statement
by
the
court,
in
other
words
the
finding
of
trespasser
is
a
conclusion
of
law
and
mr.
knox
for
the
petitioner
says
the
same
as
the
employees.
it
was
only
the
defendant
that
sought
to
bring
the
question
of
workman's
compensation
directly
before
this
jury
by
its
seven-point
per
charge
which
the
court
refused.
but
we
maintain
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
applying
the
facts,
in
apply
the
legal
principles
to
the
facts
that
were
brought
out
by
the
petitioner's
own
evidence
in
this
case
and
there
was
no
dispute
about
that
evidence.
and
that
consequently
that
the
petitioner,
the
family
of
decedent
should
be
relegated
to
the
remedies
which
are
permitted
under
the
workman's
compensation
act
and
as
i
say
that
petition
has
been
and
still
is
pending.
and
when
they
say
that
this
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
judges
goodrich,
maris
and
hasties,
three
of
our
best
judges
i
think
in
our
third
circuit,
as
solely
of
the
question
of
law
when
it
is
contrary
to
what
is
stated
here,
that
it
turns
on
a
question
of
fact
we
accept
the
jury's
finding
of
fact
and
we
are
applying
the
law
and
as
this
court
has
many
times
said,
it
is
the
duty
of
--
the
basic
task
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
the
law.
in
conclusion
i'd
simply
like
to
make
this
point,
the
petitioner's
case
it
seems
to
us
comes
down
to
this.
it's
a
case
where
the
petitioner's
own
proof
developed
all
the
evidence
of
emergency
employment
which
was
in
the
regular
course
of
the
defendant's
business
by
virtue
of
applying
the
principals
to
the
finding
of
facts
and
it's
exactly
the
same
as
though
the
petitioner
had,
had
a
negligence
case
and
disclosed
his
own
contributory
negligence
as
part
of
his
case,
admittedly
that
is
an
affirmative
defense
to
be
brought
out
by
the
defendant,
but
if
the
petitioner
brings
it
out
as
part
of
his
own
case
then
isn't
the
court
permitted
to
apply
the
principles
of
law
to
that
binding
effect.
that
is
our
case,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
as
a
matter
of
justice
in
this
case,
the
petitioners'
proper
remedies
are
in
workman's
compensation
where
they
tried
to
get
in
as
i
say
even
before
the
trial
of
this
case.
and
that
it
did
not
resolve
solely
as
a
question
of
law,
but
that
when
you
read
the
finding
of
fact
in
the
light
of
the
court's
instructions
and
all
of
the
evidence
that
preceded
the
presenting
of
the
interrogatory,
you
will
see
that
there
was
a
finding
of
fact
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
basis
of
its
decision.
