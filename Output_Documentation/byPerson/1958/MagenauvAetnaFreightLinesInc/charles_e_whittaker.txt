justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
shniderman,
do
you
contend
that
the
conclusion
as
to
whether
ormsbee
was
an
employee
was
for
the
jury
or
just
the
finding
of
facts
from
which
that
conclusion
of
law
would
follow?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understood
that
here,
under
interrogatory
number
one,
the
court
asked
the
jury
under
the
--
this
follows,
under
the
evidence
in
this
case,
do
you
find
that
an
unforeseen
contingency
arose
which
made
it
reasonably
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
defendant's
interests,
that
the
driver
charles
schroyer
engaged
the
decedent
ormsbee
to
accompany
him
for
the
reminder
of
the
trip
and
the
jury
answered
yes.
now
is
that
not
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
that,
you
maybe
all
correct
in
this,
but
it
is
--
that's
a
matter
of
argument.
it
is
true
or
is
it
not
that
the
jury
found
the
facts
by
answering
yes
submitted
in
question,
interrogatory
number
one.
