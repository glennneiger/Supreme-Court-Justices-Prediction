head
off,

--

is
there
any
--
is
there
any
--
any
evidence
as
to
how
long
this
barrel
was
--
barrel
of
the
shotgun?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren

earl
warren
mr.
tenneson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
doctor
say
about
--
about
the
seriousness
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
burden
did
he
have
after
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
an
8
to
10
inch
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
screwdriver.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
it
always
been
in
good
condition
as
far
as
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
--
who
is
handling
it
when
it
went
off
accidentally,
supposedly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
--
which
one
--
which
pattern
was
the
one
that
had
some
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
where
those
on
the
lower?
chief
justice
earl
warren
lower
down.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
was
that
from
the
floor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
four
to
five.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
where
did
they
say
those
powder
burns
were
on
the
jacket?
chief
justice
earl
warren
toward
the
front
or
toward
the
rear?
chief
justice
earl
warren
toward
the
front.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
let's
see
--
let's
see
you
do
that
and
get
--
get
it
on
your
head
in
a
way
so
that
will
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
reset
back
--
can
you
reset
back
the
trigger?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
are
not
--
you
haven't
got
it
on
your
head.
you
got
off
the
side
of
your
head.
get
on
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
other
--
what
other
evidence
beside
the
fact
that
--
that
a
stray
screwdriver
was
laying
on
the
floor
of
the
silage?
the
silage
shed
would
indicate
that
he
used
it
to
pull
the
trigger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
what
about
--
what
about
the
stray
screwdriver
around
a
bar
(inaudible)
is
that
evidence?
would
you
take
that
as
the
evidence
normally
that
--
that's
the
way
a
man
discharge
a
gun?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
one
way
it
could
be
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
you'd
you
mind
showing
us
now
how
you
would
--
you
would
discharge
that
gun
at
your
head
and
use
the
--
and
use
the
screwdriver?
chief
justice
earl
warren
put
your
gloves
on.
put
your
gloves
on.[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
why
you'd
shoot
all
those
people
at
--
in
the
back
of
the
court
and
miss
yourself
entirely
with
that.
you
didn't
have
a
gun
in
your
hand
at
all,
as
i
saw
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
been
pointing
over
your
head
and
at
--
at
those
people
back
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
quoted
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
the
--
on
the
body
itself,
the
--
the
wound
to
the
rear
--
on
the
rear
of
the
side
was
lower
than
the
wound
in
front.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
much
--
how
much
lower?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
necessarily
--
i
--
i
don't
know
but
--
but
it
necessarily
followed
that
it
was
lower
in
the
back
if
he
did
lean
over
this
--
this
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it
could
be
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
could
be
either
way
i
suppose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i'm
looking
at
this
--
this
picture
on
page
25,
defendant's
exhibit
17
which
shows
the
wounds
on
--
on
the
body
that
--
that
wound
in
--
in
the
breast
and
looked
to
be
too
far
from
the
heart
region,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
took
some
of
the
ribs
off.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
did
collapse
a
lung.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
force
of
that
shotgun
in
that
particular
part
of
a
man's
body
be
so
terrific
that
he'd
have
very
little
control
over
his
arms
and
his
movement
after
that?
as
i
view
this
--
as
i
--
as
i
look
at
this
picture
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
looks
very
close
to
the
heart
and
--
and
his
lung
was
collapsed
and
his
ribs
were
--
were
taken
off,
you
say
some
--
some
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
that
shock
of
that
--
that
150
or
so
pellets
in
the
shotgun
with
the
force
of
that
powder
behind
it
be
such
not
only
as
to
give
him
great
pain
but
as
to
stun
him
and
make
him
incapable
of
agility
or
falling
out
of
course
of
conduct
after
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
unreasonable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
fact
that
he
was
conscious
and
the
fact
that
he
had
some
strength
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
still
leave
it
very,
very
arguable
as
to
whether
he
had
the
agility
to
--
to
go
through
the
contortion
that
you
had
to
go
through
to
get
that
gun
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
shoulder
to
do
it
then
in
a
--
in
a
parallel
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when?
on
the
second
shot?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
he'd
--
then
he'd
have
more
trouble
--
more
trouble
in
getting
to
the
triggers
to
shoot
himself
parallel
wise
through
the
--
through
the
head,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
the
doctor
say
about
the
use
of
his
left
arm
after
that
--
after
that
shot,
was
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
--
does
--
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
suppose
the
man
wouldn't
have
much
use
of
that
arm
after
--
after
a
jolt
and
the
wound
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we're
dealing
in
--
we're
dealing
in
conjecture,
all
of
us
are.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
i
just
wondered
if
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
--
to
believe
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
we
all
deal
in
theory,
why
couldn't
the
--
why
couldn't
the
jury
and
the
trial
judge
be
entitled
to
--
to
indulge
in
theory
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
reason
why
they
shouldn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
might
not
the
gun
had
been
kept
in
the
shed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
do
you
say
what
possibly
could
have
taken
him
into
that
shed?
maybe
he
went
in
there
to
get
the
gun.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
oh,
pardon
me.
is
there
anything
in
--
in
the
record
as
to
the
condition
of
the
floor
in
the
silage
shed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
does
that
--
what,
if
any,
does
that
do
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
strychnine
case,
the
svihovec
case
that
you
mentioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
vogel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
appear,
mr.
vogel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
butt
of
the
ground
--
butt
of
the
gun
was
on
the
ground
when
he
shot
the
top
of
his
head
off,
it
could
--
couldn't
possibly
have
been
parallel,
could
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
to
be
elevated
if
--
if
the
butt
was
on
the
ground,
the
barrel
would
have
to
be
elevated.
it
couldn't
possibly
shoot
parallel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
the
evidence
is
that
those
--
those
pellets
did
go
parallel
into
the
wall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
at
a
--
at
a
height
of
about
four
to
five
feet.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
