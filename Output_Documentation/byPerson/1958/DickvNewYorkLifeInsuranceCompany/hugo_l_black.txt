justice

from
the
left
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
man
right-handed
or
left-handed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
lying
on
his
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
other
witnesses
who
(inaudible)
to
testify
--
gave
the
testimony
as
expert
testimony
(inaudible)
his
back
or
front?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
doctor
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
those
conjectures
did
happen,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
possibly
know
that
there
were
two
separate
accidents
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
than
the
gun
falling
and
--
and
shooting
twice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
man
shot
followed
in
the
shooting.
how
can
you
know
this
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
know
there
were
shots
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
there
had
to
be
two
separate
accidents.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
if
they
were,
i
--
i
know
that
you
don't
think
he'd
make
the
shot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
though
can
you
reach
in
conclusion
at
the
one
end
that
both
of
them
had
to
be
accidents?
how
can
you
reach
a
conclusion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
both
of
them
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
separate
accidents?
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
what
you
--
what
you're
be
wiling
to
concede
would
be
that
if
there's
one
shot
fired
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
would
concede
that
that
was
sufficient
to
draw
the
inference
that
there
was
an
accident.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
one
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
man
shot
twice,
the
man
shot
twice,
he
can't
do
that
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
getting
away
from
that
word,
why?
how
do
we
know
that
it
didn't
drop
one
--
shoot
the
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
indicates
there
had
no
accident
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
indicate,
does
it,
that
there
might
not
have
been
two
shots
fired
almost
simultaneously
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
accidental
discharge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
tenneson,
is
mr.
(inaudible)
the
sheriff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
understand
by
this
evidence
that
you
gave,
“on
january
28,
1955,
i
testified
at
lisbon
that
it
appeared
the
charge
was
up
from
the
floor
into
the
body
rather
than
into
the
body
from
an
upward
position
because
the
wound
is
larger
at
the
bottom
and
it
is
upside”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
up
from
the
floor
into
the
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
--
and
--
but
the
--
it's
up
to
the
floor.
it
couldn't
have
been
--
started
at
the
front,
could
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that.
that's
another
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
front
--
that
--
that's
another
piece
of
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that's
different
with
--
what
do
you
understand
he
meant
when
he
said
that
it
was
up
from
the
floor
into
the
body
rather
than
into
the
body
from
an
upward
position
because
the
wound
is
larger
at
the
bottom
and
isn't
the
top
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
understand
he
meant
to
say
by
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
looks
--
sounds
pretty
clear
to
me
that
he
thought
it
came
from
the
bottom
up.
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
reading
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
by
that
testimony,
i
meant
that
the
charge
started
from
the
position
of
the
ground
rather
than
by
holding
the
gun
in
the
air.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
--
has
more
expertise
in
regard
to
determining
whether
that
was
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
weight
do
you
attribute
to
the
fact
here?
he
went
into
the
shed.
do
you
think
that
he
couldn't
have
committed
suicide
outside
this
as
well?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
very
slight
pull
of
the
finger
but
when
it's
caught
dropping,
it
wouldn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
evidence?
was
that
on
cross-examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
any
redirect
evidence
brought
out,
just
to
try
to
explain
this?
