mr.
philip
b.
vogel
may
it
please
the
court.
this
lawsuit
comes
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
this
way.
the
plaintiff
below
and
the
petitioner
here
started
her
lawsuit
in
the
north
dakota
district
court
back
in
1956.
and
in
her
complaint,
she
alleged
that
her
husband
was
accidentally
killed
by
gunshot
wounds
on
january
20,
1955.
she
alleged
that
at
the
time
of
his
death,
and
for
many
years
before
his
death,
he
had
two
different
life
insurance
policies
with
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
that
doubled
for
accidental
death,
and
she
asked
for
$15,000
on
these
policies.
the
new
york
life
insurance
company,
because
more
than
$3000
was
involved
and
because
there
was
a
diversity
of
citizenship,
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court
in
north
dakota.
they
interposed
in
answer
in
which
they
set
up
as
an
affirmative
defense
their
conclusion
that
mr.
dick,
the
husband
of
the
plaintiff,
had
died
by
his
own
hand
intensionally
and
that
his
death
was
a
suicide.
the
lawsuit
was
tried
before
a
jury
in
fargo
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
favor
of
mrs.
dick,
and
held
in
effect
that
the
death
was
accidental.
the
attorney
for
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
moved
for
a
new
trial
or
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
there
were
extensive
arguments
before
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
judge
immediately
denied
both
of
those
motions.
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
then
appealed
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
by
a
unanimous
judgment,
held
that
because
two
shots
were
fired
in
connection
with
this
man's
death
that
the
death
had
to
be
suicidal
and
they
ordered
judgment
for
the
new
york
life
insurance
company.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
yes,
he
is,
your
honor.
that
is
how
the
lawsuit
came
before
the
supreme
court.
we
asked
for
certiorari
and
certiorari
was
granted
last
summer.
now,
these
are
the
facts
that
are
justified
by
the
record.
they
are
facts
that
are
not
contradicted
or,
as
i
say,
they
are
justified
by
the
record.
mr.
dick,
at
the
time
of
his
death,
was
a
man
of
47
years.
he
was
a
strong
healthy
man
who
had
no
troubles
of
any
kind
with
his
family.
he
was
respected
by
his
neighbors
and
by
his
friends.
he
owned
a
section
of
land
near
lisbon,
north
dakota
and
farmed
it
himself.
his
land
was
free
of
all
incumbrances.
he
had
about
$1000
in
the
bank.
he
had
had
no
trouble
with
his
family,
with
his
neighbors
or
with
his
friends.
he
did
have
some
prostate
trouble.
he
had
been
treated
by
that,
but
the
testimony
was,
that
it
was
a
matter
of
very
little
consequence.
on
the
night
before
he
died,
he
sat
down
with
his
wife
and
his
14-year-old
daughter
and
went
over
with
the
daughter
her
general
science
lessons
explaining
to
her
for
an
hour
the
workings
of
a
transformer.
he
went
to
bed
that
night
and
slept
soundly.
the
next
morning,
he
got
up
and
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
and
backed
the
car
out
of
the
garage,
so
that
his
wife
could
take
the
little
girl
to
the
country
school.
he
then
went
out
to
the
barn
to
take
care
of
his
milking
and
his
chores.
and
he
and
his
wife
would
arranged
that
after
he
was
through
with
his
chores
that
what
they
would
do
would
be
to
go
over
to
a
neighbor's
house
and
help
make
sausage.
when
mrs.
dick
got
back
from
taking
her
child
to
school,
her
husband
was
not
back
in
the
house
from
the
barn,
and
so
she
went
out
to
the
barn
to
look
for
him.
she
thought
the
he
might
be
throwing
silage
down
from
the
silo.
and
so,
she
walked
into
a
silage
shed,
a
little
building
that
was
about
12
feet
long
and
8
feet
wide.
her
husband
was
lying
there
on
his
back
with
a
great
wound
in
his
left
side
and
with
the
top
of
his
head
completely
blown
off.
she
ran
back
to
the
house
and
called
the
neighbor
for
help.
when
the
sheriff
and
the
other
officials
arrived,
they
found
the
body
as
it
was.
they
noticed
that
by
the
side
of
the
body,
there
was
a
double-barrel
shotgun
and
that
both
barrels
of
the
gun
had
been
discharged.
the
sheriff
also
noticed
that
there
was
a
screwdriver,
six
or
eight
inches
long
that
was
lying
somewhere
close
to
the
body.
the
officers
and
the
other
witnesses
also
noticed
that
close
by
the
side
of
the
barn,
there
had
been
pin
stack
of
place
where
mr.
dick
had
his
hay
and
his
corn
and
his
feed
that
he
kept
for
his
cows.
they
saw
that
on
one
side
of
the
fence
were
the
cows
and
they
could
see
that
the
cows
had
eaten
up
the
corn,
that
the
farmer
had
put
over
that
fence
into
the
mangers
for
the
cows.
but
side
by
side
with
the
barn
and
on
the
side
of
the
fence
away
from
the
cattle
themselves,
there
was
a
bucket
that
was
filled
with
ground
corn.
and
the
farmer
had
been
in
a
habit
of
always,
after
he
had
thrown
the
silage
into
the
manger
of
distributing
this
ground
corn
over
the
corn
and
the
silage.
but
on
this
particular
occasion,
the
ground
corn
was
not
distributed.
the
testimony
shows
at
several
months
before
the
happening
of
this
man's
death,
he
had
been
bothered
in
the
operation
of
his
farm
by
vicious
dogs
attacking
his
flock
of
sheep.
he
had
a
flock
of
about
100
sheep.
and
on
one
occasion,
several
months
before
his
death,
about
30
of
the
sheep
were
either
killed
or
mangled.
i
believe
that
the
jury
believed
and
i
believe
that
what
happened
was
that
he
was
out
feeding
his
cattle.
he
had
put
the
corn
on
the
side
of
the
fence
where
the
cattle
were.
he
was
about
to
pour
the
corn
over
the
feeds
so
that
the
cattle
could
eat
the
feed
and
the
corn
when
he
saw
something
close
to
his
flock
of
sheep
whether
it
was
a
vicious
dog
or
more
than
one
dogs,
no
one
knows,
because
no
one
was
on
the
farm
at
that
time.
but
at
any
rate,
he
put
the
bucket
of
corn
down.
it
was
snowing
at
the
time
and
there
was
a
slight
amount
of
snow
that
covered
the
basket
of
corn.
and
into
the
barn
he
went
and
there,
he
was
found
with
these
two
wounds,
one
in
his
side
and
the
other
on
the
top
of
his
head.
the
insurance
company
took
the
position
that
what
he
had
done
was
to
set
down
the
bucket
of
feed
and
had
gone
into
the
barn,
intent
on
killing
himself.
we
believe
that
he
went
into
the
barn
to
get
his
shotgun
which
was
always
kept
in
the
barn
to
attack
the
vicious
dogs
that
may
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
at
that
time.
at
the
time
of
this
man's
death,
when
he
was
found
lying
on
the
shed
of
this
silo
room,
he
was
wearing
some
heavy
gleasy,
woolen,
cotton
gloves
that
were
bulky
gloves
that
could
only,
with
some
effort,
be
inserted
into
the
gun
trigger
guard
so
that
the
trigger
of
the
gun
could
be
pulled.
and
i
am
sure
that
the
jury
felt
under
those
circumstances
that
if
a
man
have
planned
to
and
wanted
to
do
away
with
himself,
wanted
to
perform
what
was
for
him
the
most
important
act
of
his
whole
life,
under
no
circumstances
would
he
be
wearing
any
gloves
at
all.
and
if
he
wanted
to
do
that,
he
certainly
would
not
be
wearing
heavy
bulky
gloves
that
could
hardly
be
inserted
into
the
trigger
guard
of
the
gun.
another
important
thing,
it
was
important,
i
believe,
to
the
jury
into
the
trial
court
was
that
there
was
no
blood
whatsoever
on
the
gloves.
they're
entirely
free
of
blood
and
so
as
the
gun
itself
free
of
any
blood.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
had
happened
was
that
if
the
insurance
company
were
right
that
this
man
would
set
down
his
bucket
of
corn
and
would
go
into
the
shed
the
intent
upon
killing
himself
and
aimed
the
gun
barrel
at
his
side
here
and
pull
one
of
the
triggers
to
shoot
off
one
of
the
shotgun
shells
that
under
those
circumstances,
if
he
had
done
that,
he
certainly
would
have
taken
his
hand
or
his
gloves
to
examine
his
sight
to
see
whether
the
wound
which
he
had
was
mortal
or
not,
to
see
whether
he
was
about
to
die
from
the
wound
that
he
had
inflicted,
but
as
i
say,
there
was
no
blood
of
any
kind
either
on
his
gloves
or
on
his
hand.
the
doctor
who
testified
in
the
lawsuit
and
who
came
to
the
scene
of
this
man's
death
testified
that
the
first
wound
that
the
man
had
on
his
side
was
a
wound
that
was
about
six
or
seven
inches
long
that
started
rather
low
in
the
back
on
the
side
and
came
in
an
upward
point
that
it
was
a
severe
wound,
abrasive
wound,
but
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
completely
collapse
the
man's
left
lung.
the
doctor
said
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
pain
that
the
man
would
have
would
be
unbearable
and
if
--
yes
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
the
doctor
who
testified
said
that
the
lower
part
of
the
wound
was
from
the
back
and
the
higher
part
of
the
wound
was
to
the
front.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
no,
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
say
that
this
particular
doctor
made
that
statement.
there
was
conflicting
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
the
shell
came
from
the
front
or
from
the
back.
the
sheriff
who
was
called
by
the
insurance
company
to
testify
stated
that
in
his
opinion,
the
shell
came
from
low
down
from
the
back
and
went
in
an
upward
direction
and
came
in
contact
with
the
wall
of
the
building
at
the
northwest
corner
of
the
building.
a
police
officer
from
fargo,
a
young
police
officer
was
called
to
testify
and
he
testified
that
in
his
opinion,
the
wound
came
from
the
front
and
went
in
a
downward
position.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
on
the
left
side,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
whether
he
was
left-handed
or
right-handed.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
is
a
picture
with
the
person
who
is
having
the
picture
taken
with
gloves
on
or
not.
it
is
not
a
picture
of
the
dead
man.
it
is
a
post
picture
and
the
man
who
lies
here
is
his
brother.
and
i
truly
cannot
tell
from
looking
at
the
picture
whether
or
not
there
is
a
glove
on
it
or
not.
but
in
any
event,
these
are
the
gloves
that
the
deceased
wore
at
the
time
of
his
death.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
he
was
lying
on
his
back,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
those
were
the
only
two
witnesses.
and
they
were
both
called
by
the
insurance
company.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
he
said
nothing
with
respect
to
where
the
shot
came
from.
he
did
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
powder
burns
on
the
man's
left
side.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
mr.
justice,
it
had
two
triggers.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
the
triggers
were
separate
triggers
and
i
suppose
that
they
could
be
fired
simultaneously.
the
right
trigger
fires
the
right
barrel
and
the
left
trigger
fired
the
left
barrel.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
yes,
front
and
rear.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
lawsuit
and
in
the
argument
before
the
trial
judge
on
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
and
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
was
the
position
of
the
insurance
company
attorneys
that
the
law
in
north
dakota
was
not
applicable
to
the
trial
of
this
case
insofar
as
the
burden
of
proof
is
concerned.
and
that
is
rather
important
because
under
our
north
dakota
law,
in
all
four
of
the
decisions
that
we
have
in
cases
that
are
similar
to
this,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
has
specifically
held
over
a
period
of
more
than
50
years
that
in
these
cases,
there
is
a
presumption
against
suicide
that
that
presumption
stays
with
the
widow
of
the
deceased
during
the
entire
lawsuit
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
these
lawsuits
is
on
the
insurance
company.
as
i
say,
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
attorney
for
the
insurance
company
at
no
time
cited
any
north
dakota
cases
to
support
their
view.
their
view
was
that
the
trial
court
should
follow
what
mr.
tenneson
called
a
newer
and
a
better
and
a
more
modern
rule
which
apparently
provide
that
there
is
a
presumption
against
suicide
but
that
when
evidence
comes
into
the
contrary,
the
presumption
goes
out
and
no
longer
has
any
effect.
but
that
is
not
our
rule
in
north
dakota
and
of
course,
under
the
erie
rule,
the
trial
judge
was
bound
to
follow
the
north
dakota
law.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
no.the
trial
court,
mr.
justice,
just
said
that
in
these
cases,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
insurance
company.
they
don't
say
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
or
anything
of
that
kind,
but
they
do
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
insurance
company
and
remains
on
the
insurance
company
during
the
entire
trial
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
acknowledged,
of
course,
that
since
erie
on
this
matter
of
a
burden
of
proof
because
it
was
more
than
a
housekeeping
rule
because
it
affected
a
substantial
right
of
the
parties
that
they
were
bound
to
follow
the
north
dakota
rule.
and
then,
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
citing
from
one
north
dakota
case
said
under
the
circumstances
that
the
evidence
was
clear
and
convincing
that
because
two
shots
were
fired,
this
man
had
to
intensionally
kill
himself
and
that's
why
they
entered
judgment
for
the
insurance
company.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
the
evidence
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
--
that
is
in
the
record
shows
that
the
first
shot
that
was
fired
was
fired
into
the
northwest
corner
of
this
little
shed.
no
part
of
the
shot
got
into
the
roof
but
the
shots
were
in
the
wall
in
the
northwest
corner.
the
other
shots,
that
is
from
the
shot
that
took
off
the
top
of
the
man's
head
were
in
the
wall
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
shed,
about
four
or
five
feet
from
the
ground.
and
during
the
entire
trial
of
the
lawsuit
and
in
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
has
always
been
the
position
of
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
that
these
shots
into
the
southeast
corner
of
the
building
came
in
a
manner
that
was
parallel
to
the
ground.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
well,
we
could
tell
that,
mr.
justice
clark,
because
as
far
as
the
shot
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
building
was
concerned,
it
had
a
good
deal
of
the
man's
brain
matter
and
the
top
of
his
head
with
it
that
were
driven
into
the
wall.
now
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
the
gun
itself
was
46
inches
long
and
it
is
here
in
evidence.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
so
that
it
may
be
examined.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
there
was
evidence
from
a
young
policeman
in
fargo
who
testified
for
the
insurance
company
that
he
discerned
what
he
thought
were
powder
burns
on
the
front
part
of
the
man's
jacket
that
he
was
wearing.there
were
no
powder
burns
on
the
wound
on
his
side,
but
there
were
powder
wounds
at
his
left
temples
indicating
that
the
shot
that
took
off
the
top
of
his
head
came
from
the
left
across
this
way
when
he
was
in
somewhat
of
a
stooping
position
and
then
went
into
the
southeast
corner
of
this
little
shed.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
the
gun
was
his?
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
the
gun
is
here.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
yes,
it
is
right
here
in
one
of
the
boxes.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
yes.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
mr.
justice,
his
farm
which
contains
one
section
of
land
was
completely
clear
of
all
incumbrances.
he
had
$1000
in
the
bank
and
he
was
in
the
process
of
buying
another
160
acres
of
land
on
which
he
had
an
indebtedness
of,
i
think,
$6000.
he
had
had
some
prostate
trouble
and
had
gone
to
the
doctor
eight
different
times
but
the
doctor
testified
that
the
condition
was
not
serious,
that
it
was
clear
enough
that
he
was
a
happy-go-lucky
individual
and
that
he
was
not
bothered
by
the
condition.
one
of
the
exhibits
that's
in
evidence
was
a
picture
of
a
man.
the
only
picture
that
we
found,
that
would
be
the
picture
of
a
healthy,
strong
jolly
individual.
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
important
that
the
court
go
into
the
four
decisions
that
have
been
decided
by
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
so
that
it
may
be
known
just
what
the
law
in
north
dakota
is.
there
are,
as
i
say,
four
of
those
decisions
and
it's
interesting
because
in
two
of
the
decisions
are
supreme
court
held
that
a
directed
verdict
must
be
given.
and
in
two
of
the
decisions
are
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
the
man
was
a
suicide
or
not.
and
these
decisions
are
the
clemens
case,
the
svihovec
case,
the
stevens
case
and
the
paulsen
case.
the
first
two
decisions,
the
clemens
decision
and
the
svihovec
decisions,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
necessary
to
direct
a
verdict.
in
the
clemens
case,
it
was
a
case
where
a
man
was
having
financial
difficulty.
he
was
short
in
his
accounts.
he
went
to
see
his
religious
adviser.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
wife
saying,
“kiss
the
children
for
me.
i'm
sorry
i
had
to
do
this.
bury
me
at
leonard.”
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
record
was
bearing
of
any
evidence
showing
that
there
could
be
an
accidental
death.
that
was
the
clemens
case.
the
next
case
in
which
north
dakota
held
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
directed
verdict
was
a
case
where
a
mr.
svihovec
had
a
policy
of
insurance
and
the
policy
of
insurance
provided
that
there
would
be
no
coverage
if
his
death
was
suicidal
or
if
it
resulted
from
the
wrongful
act
of
another
party.
svihovec
and
the
companion
were
found
in
a
farm
home
in
western
north
dakota
far,
far
many
miles
away
from
other
homes
and
other
towns.
both
of
their
bodies
had
been
burned.
gasoline
had
been
poured
over
the
bodies
and
both
of
the
men
were
shot
through
the
heart.
and
the
supreme
court
held
that
under
those
circumstances,
there
was
no
possible
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
death
of
mr.
svihovec
could
have
been
accidental
and
that
it
had
to
have
resulted
from
the
criminal
wrongful
act
of
an
unknown
third
party.
the
two
cases
in
which
our
north
dakota
supreme
court
has
held
that
it
was
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
man
died
from
suicide
are
the
stevens
case
and
the
paulsen
case.
the
stevens
case
again
is
a
case
where
a
man
had
a
policy
of
insurance
that
did
not
give
him
protection
in
the
event
of
suicide
or
that
did
not
give
him
protection
if
he
should
be
killed
by
the
wrongful
act
of
a
third
party.
mr.
stevenson
or
mr.
stevens
was
a
brakeman
on
the
railroad.
he
was
trying
to
put
a
tramp
off
the
train.
he
had
trouble
with
the
tramp
and
in
the
altercation
in
the
night,
the
shot
rang
out,
and
he
fell
to
the
ground,
shouting
voice,
“stop
the
train.
i've
been
hit!”
he
died
shortly
thereafter.
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
held
under
those
circumstances
that
there
was
evidence
that
other
men
on
the
train
carried
guns.
this
is
a
good
many
years
ago
and
that
one
of
these
guns
could
have
been
discharged
unintentionally.
and
that
there
was
--
under
those
circumstances,
a
question
for
the
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
was
killed
by
the
unlawful
wrongful
act
of
another
person.
the
fourth
case
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
that
it
was
a
question
for
the
jury,
your
honor.
the
fourth
case
is
the
paulsen
case.
and
again
in
that
case,
our
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
man
died
from
suicide.
mr.
paulsen
was
arrested
by
some
officers
in
a
canyon
in
montana
in
connection
with
the
hunting
violation.
it
was
apparently
not
a
serious
violation.
he
was
being
taken
back
to
one
of
the
towns
to
go
before
a
magistrate.
and
they
had
to
stop
to
stay
overnight
in
a
small
hotel
in
this
town.
the
two
police
officers
slacked
in
the
room
with
paulsen
before
they
took.
and
into
the
room,
they
searched
him
thoroughly
and
found
nothing
on
him
of
any
kind.
one
of
the
officers
testified
at
the
trial
that
if
he
had
strychnine
on
him
at
the
time
he
was
taken
to
the
room,
he
must
have
had
the
strychnine
in
his
boots.
he
went
to
sleep
that
night.
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
he
was
awaken
with
terrific
pains.
he
cried
out.
a
container
that
was
empty
and
that
had
contained
strychnine
was
found
below
his
bed.
the
man
died
very
shortly
thereafter,
and
our
supreme
court
held
that
under
those
circumstances,
particularly
because
his
violation
of
the
law
was
not
great
and
was
not
serious
because
there
was
no
reason
why
the
man
should
do
away
with
himself.
it
was
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
strychnine
had
been
given
to
mr.
paulsen
by
paulsen
intentionally
or
unintentionally.
it
is
the
position
of
mrs.
dick
that
as
far
as
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
concern,
that
what
they
did
was
to
weigh
the
evidence
in
this
lawsuit.
it
is
our
position
that
the
jury
had
decided
this
case
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
and
more
than
substantial
evidence
to
show
that
this
man's
death
was
accidental.
the
jury
decided
that.
the
district
judge
supported
the
jury
and
when
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
weighed
the
evidence
and
decided
for
themselves
to
the
contrary,
they
were
doing
something
that
under
the
command
of
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
they
could
not
do.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
must
consider.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
i
believe
that
they
must
consider
the
evidence
all
right.
but
i
believe
that
under
our
north
dakota
law,
if
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
upon
which
honest
men
can
come
to
a
conclusion
that
this
is
an
accident,
then
it's
for
the
jury
to
decide
and
not
for
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
i
think
that
honest
judges
could
reach
that
and
i
think
our
district
court
judge
was
an
honest
judge.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
and
i
know
he
was.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
well,
i
am
not
saying
that
the
judges
on
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
are
not
honest
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
--
i
know
they're
capable
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
--
and
i
do
not
say
that
say
they
are
bias
men.
i
know
them
to
be
able
men.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
conclude
my
opening
argument
merely
by
saying
that
under
the
clear
edict
of
all
four
north
dakota
cases
on
this
subject
that
trial
judge
in
the
federal
court
was
right
in
submitting
this
case
to
a
jury.
he
was
required
to
submit
it
to
a
jury
and
that
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
i
submit,
was
in
error
when
they
reversed
the
judgment.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
no,
it
is
not?
that
is
the
murder
case.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
through
the
heart
--
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
their
bodies
were
burned.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
may
it
please
the
court.
the
evidence
that
was
read
from
the
record
by
mr.
justice
black
is
the
record
that
i
relied
upon
in
saying
that
one
of
the
witnesses
produced
by
the
insurance
company
did
say
that
the
shot
was
up
from
the
ground
and
across
the
body,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
fair
inference
to
draw
from
that
particular
evidence.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
on
cross-examination,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
there
was
not.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
it
appears,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
page
22
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.and
the
words
that
mr.
black
--
mr.
justice
black
read
are
exactly
the
words
that
i
would
have
read.
insofar
as
the
north
dakota
law
regarding
the
burden
of
proof
is
concerned,
it
is
more
than
just
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
or
the
burden
of
making
out
the
prima
facie
case.
in
the
four
lawsuits
that
were
tried
in
the
four
decisions
that
were
quoted,
our
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
insurance
companies
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
as
far
as
this
lawsuit
is
concerned,
the
big
factor
is
the
fact
that
the
first
wound
of
this
man
received
on
his
left
side
was
a
serious
wound
that
it
was
a
mortal
wound
from
which
he
was
going
to
die
in
a
matter
of
days
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
doctor.
it
injured
his
ribs.
it
collapsed
his
lungs.
and
to
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
man
had
wanted
to
kill
himself
that
he
would
have
had
the
will
or
the
strength
or
the
power
to
lift
up
that
gun
and
hold
it
in
a
horizontal
position
out
to
one
side
the
way
mr.
tenneson
tried
to
hold
it
with
one
lung
on
his
left
side
collapsed,
with
a
mortal
wound
in
his
side
to
say
that
he
would
do
something
like
that
in
justice
sanborn's
words
passed
the
bounds
of
credulity.
and
i'm
sure
the
jury
felt
that
too.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
well,
mr.
justice,
i
don't
know
how
the
accident
did
happen
but
i
do
know
in
the
first
place
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
insurance
company.
i
think
what
did
happen
was
that
the
man
was
outside
feeding
his
cattle.
he
put
down
his
basket
of
corn,
he
went
into
the
barn
to
get
his
gun
and
the
quickest
way
out
of
the
barn
to
where
the
vicious
dogs
might
be
would
be
through
this
little
shed
that
we're
talking
about
and
out
the
side
door.
that
would
be
the
perfect
way
for
him
to
go.
he
could
have
stumbled
on
the
steps.
the
first
shot
could
have
come
along
his
left
side
and
could
have
landed
in
the
wall
in
the
northwest
corner
where
the
shot
did
land.
he
could
have
been
turned
around
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
and
as
the
gun
was
thrown
against
the
south
wall,
it
could
have
gone
over
once
more
when
he
was
falling
from
his
first
mortal
wound
and
taken
off
the
top
of
his
head.
i
don't
know
that
it
happened
that
way
but
it
could
have
happened
that
way.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
i
believe
that
it
would
be.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
a
good
deal
more
consistent
with
that
than
the
theory
that
the
insurance
company
has
put
forward
that
this
mortally
wounded
man
would
have
the
strength
and
the
power
to
hold
that
gun
out
with
a
collapsed
lung
and
shoot
off
the
top
of
his
head.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
then,
i
think,
if
that
had
happened,
mr.
justice,
then,
i
think,
the
shots
in
the
southeast
corner
of
that
little
shed
would
not
have
been
four
or
five
feet
from
the
ground,
they
would
have
been
up
much
further
and
probably
in
the
ceiling
of
the
little
shed.
and
that's
why
in
the
brief
of
the
insurance
company
has
filed.
they
say
that
the
shot
that
come
in
from
the
side
must
have
come
with
the
gun
held
in
more
nearly
they
say
a
parallel
position
just
as
demonstrated
by
mr.
tenneson.
he
has
stooped
down
a
little
so
that
the
shot
would
go
in
to
the
wall
with
the
top
of
this
man's
head
four
or
five
feet
from
the
ground.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
a
considerable
distance
because
his
body,
when
it
was
lying,
was
lying
somewhat
west
of
the
little
door
that
went
out
of
the
shed
into
the
farmstead
yard.
and
as
i
say,
the
gun
was
lying
by
his
side.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
it
could
not
have
been.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
it
could
not
possibly
go
parallel
into
the
wall.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
that
is
right.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
four
to
five
feet
from
the
ground.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
mr.
justice,
i
don't
know
how
i
would
tell
it
but
i
know
that
it
is
a
concession
that
is
made
by
the
insurance
company
lawyers
in
their
brief.
they
take
the
position
that
the
shots
that
went
into
the
southeast
corner
went
into
the
corner
in
such
a
position
so
that
the
gun
must
have
been
parallel
when
it
was
fired.
it
is
true
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
as
mr.
tenneson
has
said
that
the
insurance
company
investigator
and
the
sheriff
did
make
certain
test
with
his
gun
and
that
it
did
not
fire
when
they
made
the
test
even
though
the
gun
was
off
safe.
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
there
is
testimony
from
mrs.
dick
herself
that
is
completely
uncontradicted
that
her
husband
did
not
like
to
hunt
with
this
gun
because
a
lot
of
times,
it
went
off
when
it
was
not
suppose
to
go
off
and
sometimes
it
would
not
go
off
when
it
should
have
gone
off.
now,
that
was
testimony
that
was
in
the
record.
and
the
jury
under
those
circumstances
could
have
believed
that
and
form
their
conclusion
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
gun
was
accidentally
discharged.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
it
is
in
the
testimony
of
--
of
mrs.
dick,
the
widow,
and
i
let
mr.
holand
here
to
find
it.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
that
is
right.
mr.
philip
b.
vogel
that
is
right.
it
is
true,
as
mr.
tenneson
said
that
the
attending
physician
who,
by
the
way,
was
the
examining
physician
for
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
testified
that
in
his
opinion,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
man
had
unbearable
pain,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
first
wound
was
mortal,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
could
hardly
stand
it
would
still
be
conscious
after
the
first
wound,
but
as
our
supreme
court
in
north
dakota
has
said
many
times,
the
jury
was
not
bound
to
believe
that
evidence
if
the
jury
didn't
want
to
believe
the
evidence.
the
position
of
the
appellant
here,
the
plaintiff
below
and
the
petitioner
is
simply
that
under
these
circumstances,
there
was
evidence
in
this
record
from
which
the
jury
could
have
concluded
that
the
death
was
accidental.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
in
denying
the
motions
for
a
new
trial
or
for
judgment
not
withstanding
the
verdict
was
correct.
and
we
believe
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
that
judgment
was
in
error.
thank
you.
