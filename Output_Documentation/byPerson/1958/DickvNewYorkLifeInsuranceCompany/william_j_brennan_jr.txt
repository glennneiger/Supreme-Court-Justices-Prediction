william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
picture,
mr.
vogel,
on
page
15
of
a
gloved
hand?
page
15
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
was
your
north
dakota
burden
of
proof
phrase,
congruence
or
clear
and
convincing?
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
the
gun
was
in
the
front?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
the
gun
is
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
in
this
room
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
left
(inaudible)
that's
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
tenneson,
do
i
understand
from
that
that
you
do
not
--
you
and
your
adversary
then
do
not
disagree
on
what
the
law
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
law
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
have
said
you
and
your
adversary
agreed
on
the
laws
of
north
dakota?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you
just
said
that
he
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
was
an
accident.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
made
out
his
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
wasn't
the
testimony
that
at
least
one
expert,
as
i
understand
it,
testified
that
the
shot
entered
the
back
and
went
out
the
front
of
his
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
testimony
of
anyone
that
the
shot
may
have
come
--
entered
the
body
from
the
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
thought
mr.
vogel
had
said
that
one
of
your
witnesses
said
one
thing
and
the
other
said
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
vogel,
tell
us
if
i
heard
it
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
on
a
big
hole
in
his
side
that
was
mortalized.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
was
facing
in
another
direction,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
he
standing
up
or
kneeling
down?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
can't
ask
you
to
put
your
--
a
hole
in
your
side
but
that
must
have
been
quite
a
feet,
must
it
not,
with
that
mortal
wound
i
understand
the
side
before
he
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
tenneson,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
double
indemnity
is
recoverable
under
this
policy
as
long
as
its
violent
steps,
violent
means
whether
accidental
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
also
to
be
accidental?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
in
other
words,
had
he
been
actually
the
victim
of
a
murder,
there'd
be
no
recovery
for
double
indemnity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
accidental.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
seven
pound
pull
something
that
requires
a
considerable
effort?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
very
considerable
effort?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
so,
then
you're
asking
us
to
believe
the
demonstration
you
put
on
that
it
took
quite
an
effort
to
discharge
the
second
barrel
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what's
the
significance
of
the
seven
pounds?
i
don't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
it
must
have
taken
an
effort
in
any
event
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
--
for
the
second
shot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
put
your
finger
on
that,
the
testimony,
quickly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
don't
waste
your
time
looking
for
it.
oh,
here
it
is
page
12.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
said
“sometimes,
it
wouldn't
fire
when
he
wanted
it
to
or
would
when
he
didn't.”
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
“when
my
husband
went
hunting,
he
sometimes
picked
up
his
father's
gun
because
he
did
--
he
didn't
trust
his
own.”
is
that
it?
