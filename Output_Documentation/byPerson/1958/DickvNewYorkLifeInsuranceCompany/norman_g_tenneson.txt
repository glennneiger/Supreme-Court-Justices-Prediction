mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
this
case,
there
is
very
little
dispute
between
us
as
to
the
essential
facts.
i
have
disagreed
very
hardly
with
some
of
the
inferences
as
to
this
man's
conduct
prior
to
death
as
stated
by
mr.
vogel.
i
think
also
it
can
be
said
that
there
is
no
argument
between
us
as
to
the
applicable
north
dakota
substantive
law.
the
law
of
north
dakota
is
that
proof
of
death
by
gunshot
wound
aided
by
the
presumption
against
suicide
creates
a
prima
facie
case,
that
is
the
law
of
north
dakota
as
enunciated
in
the
four
cases
that
counsel
has
referred
to
and
set
forth
in
the
svihovec
case
which
judge
sanborn
in
his
opinion
expressly
referred
to.
now,
under
that
rule
a
verdict
for
a
plaintiff
in
this
type
of
case
will
not
be
set
aside
unless
the
facts
and
circumstances
cannot
be
reconciled
with
any
reasonable
theory
of
accidental
death.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
we
do
not
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
did
endeavor
to
convince
the
trial
court
that
the
north
dakota
rule
was
not
the
best
rule.
i
endeavor
to
convince
the
trial
court
that
once
we
had
offered
credible
evidence
indicating
suicide
that
the
presumption
fell
out
of
the
case
and
should
not
be
referred
to
in
the
instructions.
that
i
believe
is
the
better
rule.
the
rule
sponsored
by
both
professor
wigmore
and
professor
morgan
but
unfortunately,
to
our
view,
it
is
not
the
law
of
north
dakota.
our
contention,
of
course,
here
is
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
as
disclosed
here
are
consistent
only
with
suicide
and
wholly
inconsistent
with
accident.
now,
counsel
has
drawn
in
his
argument
numerous
inferences
which
i
think
are
based
on
little
foundation
of
fact.
i,
of
course,
concede
the
right
of
counsel
to
draw
inferences
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
said
that
the
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
inferences
which
are
unreasonable
or
which
are
opposed
to
the
undisputed
facts.
i
think
that
is
sound
to
all.
now,
i
think
when
you've
boil
this
case
down,
what
you've
got
here
as
far
as
the
plaintiff
is
concerned
is
only
two
ultimate
facts,
namely,
the
insured
is
death.
and
second,
none
of
the
usual
motifs
that
appear
in
these
types
of
cases
is
present
here.
the
evidence
did
indicate
some
ill
health
on
the
part
of
this
insured.
he
was
troubled
with
prostate,
land
trouble
that
he
felt
helpless,
not
well
that
he
was
in
some
pain.
the
testimony
is
clear
that
he
went
to
his
family
physician
during
the
months
of
september,
october,
november
and
december
preceding
his
death
on
january
20,
1955.
his
wife
testified
that
she
knew
of
only
two
trips
to
the
doctor
and
the
family
has
closely
met
as
counsel
has
indicated
this
family
is
with
such
a
fine
seating
back
and
fort
between
the
parents
and
the
children,
the
neighbors
and
everybody
else.
it's
somewhat
inconceivable
that
this
man
would
not
disclose
to
his
wife
the
six
of
the
trips.
now,
i
conceive
that
certainly,
this
travel
he
had
is
not
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
ordinarily
lead
a
man
to
commit
suicide.
but
i
think
it
is
argued
that
perhaps,
he
regarded
this
illness
much
more
seriously
than
he
was
justified
in
doing.
now
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
oh,
he
said,
he
had
a
mild
to
moderate
nonspecific
prostatitis,
i
think.
then
he
said
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
pain
with
it.
well,
he
has
certain
discomfort
but
i
don't
think
i
can
fairly
say
that
this
was
a
serious
illness.
he
was
a
farmer
and
customized
whom
to
sitting
on
tractor
seats
and
he
had
trouble
in
his
back,
in
the
area
of
his
back.
the
doctor
did
give
him
hormone
injections
and
as
i
recall
the
testimony
put
him
on
sulfa
therapy.
but
the
man
came
in
and
i
think
the
doctor's
testimony
is
the
last
time
in
december
that
it
was
a
windy
and
a
cold
day
and
he
said
he
probably
had
some
aches
and
pains
in
his
back
and
that's
the
reason
he
came
in.
now,
the
plaintiff
here
naturally
has
made
much
of
the
absence
of
some
of
the
usual
motifs
which
are
common
in
the
suicide
cases.
as
the
courts
have
said,
a
motif,
of
course,
is
helpful
to
the
defendant
naturally
but
it
is
not
essential.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
courts.
and
i
think
it
is
common
knowledge
and
as
the
court
say
that
men
who
have
no
known
motif
to
commit
suicide
perhaps
there
is
always
a
motif
but
it
is
not
always
disclosed.
now,
i
hope
--
i
think
you
noticed
in
the
argument
that
counsel
made
the
statement,
“he
may
have
done
this.
he
might
have
done
this.
it's
likely
that
he
did
that.”
now,
that
seems
to
me
that
makes
a
weak
case
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
showing
how
this
accident
occurred
if
this
was
an
accident.
seems
to
me
that
you
are
entitled
to
something
more
here
than
bare
conjecture
as
to
what
might
have
happen.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
he
does
have
a
prima
facie
case,
of
course.once
you
have
a
violent
death
plus
the
presumption.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
he
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
the
law
of
north
dakota.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
my
point
is
simply
this,
perhaps,
i
used
the
wrong
words,
stronger
words
than
i
meant
to
is
that
the
plaintiff
in
his
effort
to
point
out
how
this
might
have
happened
has
indulged
in
what
i
would
say
is
conjecture
rather
than
embodying
but
on
some
facts
that
were
established
by
the
evidence
in
the
case.
and
i
think
its
--
pursuing
that
line
of
inquiry
will
lead
us
into
the
realm
of
speculation
based
upon
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
think
on
our
part,
as
i
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
later,
that
there
are
certain,
essential
facts
here
which
are
proven
and
which,
in
our
view,
are
consistent
only
with
suicide
and
wholly
inconsistent
with
accident.
now,
what
are
the
undisputed
facts
here?
as
i
view,
perhaps
counsel
will
disagree
with
me
or
the
court
may
disagree.
but
we
do
have
testimony
from
the
wife,
the
brother,
the
nephew
and
the
other
relatives
that
william
dick
was
an
experienced
hunter.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
man
that
was
not
familiar
with
firearms.
he
had
hunted
practically
every
fall
since
1926.
he
had
hunted
for
pheasants,
ducks,
geese
and
deer.
that's
not
uncommon
in
our
part
of
the
country
where
game
is
quite
plentiful.
he
was
very
thoroughly
familiar
with
shotguns
and
how
they
operate
it.
he
had
owned
this
gun
for
26
years
after
all.
and
the
testimony
by
his
wife
and
his
brothers
is
uncontradicted
that
he
was
careful
in
the
handling
of
firearms.
he
was
not
a
careless
man.
the
gun
he
owned,
the
gun
that
caused
his
death
was
the
only
gun
that
he
owns.
testimony
is
undisputed
that
he
was
a
husky,
strong
man
and
the
doctor
said
that
he
would
do
his
regular
farm
work
in
spite
of
the
misery
that
he
was
having
from
this
prostate
trouble.
now,
i
think
it's
important
here
to
consider
the
gun
that
is
here
on
evidence.
what
kind
of
a
gun
is
it?
well,
it's
a
12-gauge,
stevens,
double-barrel.
and
when
you
break
the
gun,
insert
the
shells
in
here
close
that
breech,
this
gun
is
automatically
unsafe.
you
cannot
fire
both
triggers.
and
to
guide
the
hunter,
there's
an
s
above
this
little
button
here
on
this
top.
in
order
to
fire
both
triggers,
you
have
to
do
something.
you
have
to
push
this
button
forward
and
take
it
off
safe,
then
you
may
fire
both
triggers.
you
break
the
gun
again
when
you
insert
shell,
do
it
again,
that
gun
is
unsafe.
so
it
is
obvious
that
this
gun
must
have
been
taken
off
safe
otherwise
it
would
not
have
fired.
and
as
was
asked
earlier
in
the
argument,
the
front
trigger
fires
the
right
barrel.
the
rear
trigger
fires
the
left
barrel.
i
think
that
is
common
in
practically
all
shotguns
although
some
of
the
modern
ones,
you
could
select
what
trigger
you
want
to
push
if
you're
fast
enough
to
do
it.
now,
immediately
after
this
death
was
reported,
the
sheriff
in
the
corner
came
out
to
this
little
farm,
found
this
man
lying
in
what
is
known
in
the
evidence
as
a
silage
shed.
it
is
a
small
building
between
the
barn
and
the
silage
and
has
been
testified
that
he
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
right
knees
slightly
cocked
up
against
an
outer
door.
along
side
up
of
him
was
this
gun,
the
barrel
up
high,
the
stack
down
below,
thus
beyond
that
again
was
an
8
to
10
inch
screwdriver.
that's
the
way
he
was
found
in
the
record.
there
are
pictures
showing
the
way
he
lay
as
post
by
his
brother
who
came
there
afterwards.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
screwdriver.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
now,
the
sheriff
took
this
gun
back
to
the
courthouse
and
he
proceeded
to
make
a
series
of
test
of
it.
he
put
the
gun
off
safe.
and
then
as
i
recall
the
testimony,
he
pounded
at
10
times
on
the
floor.
this
would
have
stopped
down.
see
if
it
would
discharge,
it
did
not.
he
reversed
it
and
did
the
same
process
to
the
barrel,
then
he
put
the
gun
in
firing
position
and
banged
it
against
an
object
then
took
the
gun
and
dropped
it
several
times.
he
made
all
these
tests
and
then
that
results
of
all
the
test
was
the
gun
did
not
fire,
warded
off
safe.
what's
indicated
should
indicate
and
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
inference
that
that
gun
was
in
good
working
condition.
it
certainly
was
immediately
after
this
man's
death.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
there
is
some
testimony
on
the
record
that
some
time
previously
the
gun
was
accidentally
discharged
but
i
don't
think
quite
of
the
--
the
--
on
cross
examination,
the
testimony
does
not
stand
up
but
there
is
some
such
testimony.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
think
if
--
if
it
went
off
accidentally,
your
honor,
mr.
dick.
yes.
now
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
that
is
not
too
clear
in
the
record.
the
only
testimony,
as
i
recall,
is
the
testimony
of
the
widow
that
it
was
usually
kept
in
the
barn.
but
i
--
i'm
sure
there
is
no
other
testimony
as
to
that,
usually
kept
in
the
barn.
there
was
this
barn
and
then
it
right
angles
to
the
barn
was
this
little
silage
shed
and
beyond
that,
the
silage.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
the
testimony
is
that
at
the
time
of
mr.
dick's
death,
there
were
only
two
people
there,
mr.
dick
and
his
wife.
at
the
time
mr.
dick
was
found
in
the
silage
shed,
two
discharged
12-gauge
shells
were
in
the
chambers
indicating
that
two
shots
had
been
fired.
as
i've
said,
the
shot
came
lay
along
side,
the
left
of
the
body
and
beyond
that
the
screwdriver
about
in
line
with
the
axis
of
the
body.
now,
counsel
has
made
much
of
the
argument
that
if
a
man
is
going
to
commit
suicide,
he
would
take
his
gloves
off.
the
testimony
is
that
this
was
a
cold
day
somewhere
around
zero
as
i
recall.
and
it
is
not
uncommon
in
our
country
for
people
to
wear
gloves
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
hunters
to
use
gloves.
if
it
means
anything,
i
have
hunted
myself
and
whether
it
gets
wet
or
gets
cold
you
always
wear
gloves,
and
generally,
gloves
of
this
type.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
no,
my
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
just
ordinary
25
cents
store
gloves
that
most
fit
fingers
but
it's
obvious
this
can
be
put
in
there.
now,
here's
another
evidentiary
fact
that
we
consider
of
great
importance
here
is
the
presence
of
shot
pellets
or
patterns
in
this
little
shed.
now,
then
quoting
now
the
testimony
from
george
dick,
the
brother
of
the
insured,
he
said
that
there
were
shot
pellets
in
the
northwest
corner
of
this
little
shed
and
that
they
were
also
shot
pellets
in
the
southeast
corner
near
this
outside
door.
the
shot
pellets
at
the
southeast
were
four
or
five
feet
from
the
floor,
as
i
recall
the
testimony.
the
others
were
up
in
the
corner.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
the
brain
matter,
that
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
would
be
in
the
southeast
corner.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
the
lower
down.
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
now
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
my
recollection
is
four
to
five
feet.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
and
maybe
three
to
four
but
it's
somewhere
in
that
(inaudible).
now,
our
theory
as
to
what
happened
here
is
simple.
this
man
took
this
gun
like
this,
intending
he's
hit
in
the
left
side,
he's
hit
in
the
left
side,
a
glancing
blow.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
that's
the
first
shot,
yes?
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
he
was
leaning
over,
which
what
the
counsel
--
what
mr.
vogel
referred
to.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
hope
it
is.
now,
to
corroborate
our
theory
here
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
don't
know.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
--
it
may
have,
it
may
have.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
recall
of
no
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
shot
entered
from
the
rear.
the
testimony
of
the
witness
which
we
whom
we
call
who
was
an
expert
in
firearms
attached
to
the
fargo
police
department,
a
young
man
but
a
--
who
qualified
as
an
expert
was
that
the
shot
that
there
were
powder
burns
on
the
outer
jacket
worn
by
this
man
at
the
point
where
the
shot
entered
and
that
the
shot
spreads
somewhat
as
it
came
out
the
back.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
right
in
the
area
of
the
hole
made
by
the
shotgun
fire.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
in
the
--
toward
the
front.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
and
from
the
presence
of
powder
burns,
he
deduced
the
inference
that
the
gun
--
that
the
shot
came
this
way
rather
than
this
way.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
i
think
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
that
argument
was
made
to
the
jury
and
apparently
quite
successfully
than
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
--
i
am
aware
of
no
contradiction
in
the
testimony
of
our
witnesses
as
to
where
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
the
shot
came
from.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
yes.
our
theory
is
simply
the
second
shot
was
this.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
let's
took
off
the
left
side
of
his
head.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
can.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
can.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
no,
i
got
it.[laughter]
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
they
took
off
the
side
of
his
head,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
a
part
over
here,
bottom
of
the
eye.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
that's
correct.
that
the
pattern
was
(inaudible)
that
was
the
first
shot,
the
second
pattern
is
over
this
way.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
the
evidence
will
show
and
we
have
the
man's
underwear
here,
there
was
blood
concentrated
down
the
back
and
here
in
the
crotch
indicating
that
he
was
either
standing
or
stooped
because
the
blood
had
gathered
there.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
the
screwdriver
was
there.
it
is
conceivable
that
he
used
the
screwdriver
to
fire
the
triggers.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
to
fire
the
triggers.
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
but
that
evidence
was
there,
the
screwdriver
lay
along
side
the
barrel
of
the
gun
and
beyond
it.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
it
is
purely
inference,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
it
is
one
way
that
it
could
be
done.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
have
no
screwdriver
obviously.
i
can
use
a
pen.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
you
want
my
gloves
on?
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
your
honor
is
right
again.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
we
don't
think
so.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
if
you
regard
them
both
as
accidents,
i
would
--
i
would
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
yes,
yes,
conceivable.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
your
honor.
that's
conceivable.
the
first
explosion
might
have
been
accidental
but
the
sequence
of
the
two
in
our
view
at
least
rules
out
that
possibility.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
was
the
decisive
factual
element
in
the
case
that
led
him
to
set
aside
the
jury
verdict,
and
particularly
when
this
--
this
blast
occurred
at
180
degrees
angle
from
each
other.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
how
can
i
know,
your
honor,
that
there
were
two
accidents?
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
we
know
that
two
shots
were
fired.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
do
not
concede
that
there
are
accidents,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
i
am
willing
to
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
am
willing
to
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i'm
wiling
to
concede
that
one
shot
might
have
been
accidental,
might
have.
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
in
this
court
today
if
there
were
only
one
shot
fired.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
might
have
been
accident.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
yes,
i
would
think
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
you
get
two
of
them
and
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
you're
--
you
are
stretching
credulity
as
the
--
beyond
the
breaking
point
as
the
court
of
appeals
said.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
we
don't
know
except
that
the
test
of
the
gun
by
the
sheriff,
the
violent
abuse
that
it
was
subjected
to
immediately
after
the
shooting
indicates
the
gun
was
in
good
working
condition
and
it
could
not
have
been
fired
unless
it
were
off
safe.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
that
is
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
the
only
effect
in
the
case
which
cast
doubt
upon
that
is
the
fact
the
shot
patterns
are
in
different
corners
of
the
shed,
one
in
the
northwest
corner,
one
in
the
southeast,
180
degrees
angle.
if
you
had
exploded
two
triggers
at
once,
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
you
would
get
shot
patterns
in
the
area
and
where
they
were
found.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i'm
--
that
is
the
statement
i
make.
i'm
erroneous,
i
would
like
to
be
corrected.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
no.
no,
your
honor.
we
must,
of
course,
concede
that
this
injury
that
caused
his
death
was
external
and
violent.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
yes,
that
is
the
language
of
the
policy.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
that
is
a
question,
it
is
not
in
the
case.
at
least
there's
no
evidence
that
he
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
was
murdered.
and
i,
frankly,
have
not
briefed
it.
the
--
the
policy
does
provide
that
double
indemnity
benefit
shall
be
fail
if
the
insured's
death
resulted
from
self
--
pardon
me,
i'm
reading
too
far
again,
“the
double
indemnity
benefits
referred
to
shall
be
payable
only
upon
receipt
of
due
proof
that
the
death
of
the
insured
resulted
directly
and
independently
of
all
other
causes
from
bodily
injury
effected
solely
through
external,
violent
and
accidental
means.”
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i'm
reading
from
the
pleadings
on
the
record.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
my
understanding
of
that
testimony,
he
is
referring
to
the
wound
on
the
left
side
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
up
--
up
from
the
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
it's
like
--
like
this.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
the
undisputed
testimony
in
the
case
is
that
there
were
powder
burns
on
the
--
on
the
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
(voice
overlap)
and
that
the
charge
came
from
front
to
rear.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
the
wound
would
be
larger
as
it
--
as
the
shots
exited
from
the
body
and
it
would
be
where
the
shots
entered.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
as
you
read
it,
your
honor,
it's
not
too
clear.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
i
have
always
understood
him
to
mean
that
the
shot
charge
here
came
from
the
bottom
up
and
entered
--
came
in
this
angle
rather
than
on
the
other
angle.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
yes,
that
the
stack
was
on
the
ground.
that's
my
understanding
of
what
he's
saying.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
that's
correct.
that's
my
understanding
of
what
he
meant.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
that
is
correct.
and
the
way
i
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
don't
recall.
it
was
not
very
much,
as
i
recall
the
testimony.but
we
account
for
that
the
fact
that
he
was
stooping
over.
we've
demonstrated
that
in
our
office
a
number
of
times
and
that
is
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
depending
upon
the
degree
that
you
lean.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
i
suppose
it
could.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
no.
it
is
somewhere
as
i
recall
the
testimony
in
the
arch
of
the
ribs
here.
it
did
take
off
some
of
the
arch
in
the
rib
bone
here.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
that's
right,
some
of
them.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
believe
he
testified
it
did.
that's
my
recollection.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
they
were.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
i
suppose
that
is
one
possible
inference,
they're
conjecture,
one
can
go
from
it.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
think,
your
honor,
it
is.
the
testimony
of
the
physician
and
i'm
trying
to
stay
with
the
testimony
in
the
record
here
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
is
that
he
was
conscious
and
that
he
had
the
strength
and
ability
to
discharge
that
second
barrel.
now,
you
may
disagree
with
the
doctor's
conclusion
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
--
but
that
is
the
record
in
the
case.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
and
he
had
the
ability
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
the
only
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
we
have
the
evidence
that
blood
had
drained
into
the
crotch
of
the
underwear
and
the
underwear
is
here
indicating
that
he
was
in
an
upright
position.
now,
he
might
have
been
down
this
way
as
well
as
standing
which
would,
of
course,
give
him
more
support.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
he's
got
the
advantage
of
this
shoulder
out
here
the
distance
of
--
from
the
head
to
the
shoulder
but
he
doesn't
have
otherwise.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
he
didn't
testify.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
frankly
cannot
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
i
am
not
a
petitioner
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
it
is
my
personal
opinion
it
would.
and
i'm
thoroughly
satisfied
as
to
the
sequence
of
events
here.
and
the
hazard
in
this
case,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
we
can
indulge
in
any
kind
of
speculation
and
conjecture
and
depart
from
what's
in
the
record.
now,
we
can
build
theories
one
way
or
the
other
and
i
have
tried
in
my
argument
here
to
stay
with
the
undisputed
facts
in
the
case.
and
i
realize
if
this
is
a
fruitful
case
in
which
to
indulge
in
speculation
as
to
what
might
have
happened.
but
i
--we
feel
it
is
our
position
from
these
undisputed
facts
here
that
this
was
not
accident
that
it
had
to
be
suicide.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
i'm
sure
the
jury
did.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
i
think
that
they
are
bound
to
stick
to
the
record
facts
that
they
can
draw
inferences
which
are
unreasonable
or
which
are
opposed
to
the
undisputed
facts.
of
course,
that's
the
function
on
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
jury
indulges
in
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
they
have,
i
would
say,
obviously
agree
to
expertness
in
weighing
evidence
than
the
jury
would
have.
and
i
think
your
honor
is
well-realized
as
the
burden
that
attorney
has
defending
a
case
of
this
kind
so
far
as
the
jury
is
concern.sympathy
naturally
is
with
the
plaintiff.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
and
i
assume
that
involves
the
process
of
weighing
it
if
they're
going
to
consider
it.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
yes,
and
that
is
about
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
and
the
appellate
court
on
the
record
concluded
the
judgment
couldn't
stand
because
as
judge
sanborn
said,
you
can
believe
an
experienced
hunter
might
accidentally
shoot
himself
once
but
the
certain
theory
that
he
could
accidentally
shoot
himself
first
with
one
barrel
and
then
with
the
other
stretch
his
credulity
beyond
the
wrecking
point
and
that
was
the
view
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
you
got
another
circumstance
here,
i
haven't
dwelled
on.
i
don't
believe
that
this
death
occurred
in
a
small
shed
probably
7
feet
wide
and
11
or
12
feet
long,
as
i
recall,
i
maybe
off
1
foot
or
more.
what
was
this
man
doing
in
the
shed
if
there
were
wild
dogs
around,
as
the
counsel
would
have
us
believe?
what
was
he
doing
in
the
shed?
he
can't
shoot
them
there
and
a
significant
fact
in
the
record
here
as
far
as
these
wild
dogs
killing
sheep
is
concerned,
there
isn't
any
testimony
from
the
witness
anywhere
that
the
sheep
or
the
cattle
or
anything
else
was
being
molested
around
that
farmstead
that
morning
and
this
wild
dog
business
happened
more
than
a
year,
about
a
year
prior
to
this
particular
day.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
oh,
i
think
he
could,
yes,
personally.
but
i
say
that
it
is
improbable
that
he
would
go
into
that
shed
if
he
had
any
design
to
use
that
gun
for
a
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
dogs
or
anything
else
that
might
have
been
around.
in
other
words,
the
dogs
hadn't
cornered
him
in
the
shed.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
we
don't
know
where
the
gun
was
kept
except
the
widow's
testimony,
as
i
recall,
that
she
thought
it
was
kept
in
the
barn.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
all
right,
let
us
--
let
us
assume
that
he
did.
now,
it
is
--
there
---
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
he
stumbled
anywhere.
there
is
no
evidence,
physical
evidence
that
there
was
any
showing
that
he
had
slid
on
the
silage
shed
or
any
such
thing
as
that,
no
bear
marks
to
--
on
the
silage
floor
to
indicate
that
he
slipped
or
he
had
fallen.
there
is
no
testimony.
there
are
no
nails,
hooks
or
projections
in
the
shed
of
any
kind
might
uphold
these
triggers.
and
certainly,
it
required
some
act
of
somebody
to
discharge
these
triggers
unless
you
are
going
to
throw
out
completely
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
as
to
the
efforts
he
made
to
discharge
this
gun
and
he
also
testified
that
it
took
seven
pounds
pull
to
discharge
these
triggers
and
that
he
made
that
test
on
both
triggers.
now,
what
--
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
the
testimony
is
that
there
was,
as
i
recall,
a
slight
sprinkle
of
silo
on
the
floor
and
on
the
steps.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
--
i
--
to
--
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it
has
no
significance
whatsoever
if
there
had
been
testimony
that
this
silo
had
been
disturbed
in
various
spots
that
occurred
indicating
slipping.
that
might
some
point
but
the
silage
floor
and
steps
were
relatively
clean.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
yes.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
i
would
say
so
--
oh,
no.
i
can
discharge
this
trigger
without
much
exertion
but
it
does
require
some
pull
indicating
that
there
--
the
trigger
was
firm.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
oh,
no,
no,
there
is
no
effort
in
discharging
(inaudible)
at
all.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
well,
to
show
that
this
was
not
an
easy
pull,
that
it
was
not
--
the
gun
was
--
was
in
poor
condition,
that
the
pull
was
so
slight
that
touching
it
with
your
fingers
or
anything
at
all
might
cause
this
gun
to
go
off.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
it
took
an
effort,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
both
shot.
mr.
norman
g.
tenneson
dropping
it
or
any
other
the
test
that
were
made
and
they
gave
subject
to
this
gun
to
vary
violent
abuse
to
determine
whether
it
was
conceivable
that
this
gun
might
have
accidentally
discharge.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
test.
and
i
might
close
by
quoting
here
the
--
briefly
the
conclusion
of
judge
sanborn
that
the
infliction
of
two
wounds
in
succession,
one
in
the
left
side
in
close
proximity
to
the
heart
and
the
other
in
the
head
cannot
be
in
reconciled
with
any
reasonable
theory
of
accident,
and
that
under
the
evidence,
the
question
whether
the
death
was
accidental,
was
not
a
question
of
fact
from
the
jury.
and
in
the
language
of
the
svihovec
case
which
is
the
last
question
of
our
court
and
which
restates
the
holding
in
the

human
experience
and
into
speculation
upon
fantastic
possibility.
