mr.
harold
w.
bangert
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
is
aware
half
of
our
time
will
be
shared
by
the
national
association
of
broadcasters,
as
amicus.
the
respondent
is
a
member
of
the
national
association
of
broadcasters
and
as
such
shares
views
largely
that
will
express
--
be
expressed
amicus.
we,
however,
must
limit
our
arguments
essentially
to
the
narrow
framework
of
the
case.
and
it
leads
us
directly
to
sorensen
against
wood
which
we
feel
is
the
foundation
of
the
confusion
that
has
brought
on
this
litigation
today.
in
1932,
the
nebraska
court,
in
a
dicta,
the
defendant
in
the
action
was
not
a
candidate,
in
a
pure
dicta,
had
this
to
say.
the
defendant
company
like
most
radio
broadcasters
is
to
a
large
extent
engaged
in
the
business
of
commercial
advertising
for
pay.
it
maybe
assumed
that
this
is
sufficient
not
only
to
carry,
it's
necessary
large
overhead,
but
to
make
at
least
a
fair
return
on
its
investment.
or
it
appears
that
the
opportunities
are
so
attractive
to
investors
and
the
available
airwave
would
be
greatly
overcrowded
by
broadcasting
stations,
were
it
not
for
restrictions
of
a
number
of
licensees
under
the
federal
authority.
such
commercial
advertising
is
strongly
competitive
with
newspaper
advertising,
because
it
performs
a
similar
office
between
those
having
wares
to
advertise
and
those
who
are
potential
users
of
those
wares.
radio
advertising
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
agencies
to
promote
the
principles
of
religion
and
politics.
it
competes
with
newspapers,
magazines
and
publications
of
every
nature.
the
fundamental
principles
of
law
involved
in
publication
by
a
newspaper
and
by
a
radio
station
seem
to
be
alike.
there
is
no
legal
reason
why
one
should
be
favored
over
another,
nor
why
a
broadcasting
station
should
be
granted
special
favors
as
against
one
who
maybe
a
victim
of
a
libelous
publication.
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
the
1927
the
broadcasting
industry
as
we
know
it
today
was
about
four
years
old.
the
respondent
went
into
business
in
1923
and
is
one
of
the
oldest
stations
in
the
united
states.
it
must
be
remembered
too,
that
in
writing
in
the
provisions
of
the
radio
act,
which
became
section
315,
the
writers
of
the
provisions,
that
is
to
say
the
members
of
congress
were
particularly
experts
in
the
matter
about
which
they
legislate,
the
matter
of
that
broadcast
of
non-censored
material
by
political
candidates.
therefore
in
one
section
of
the
communications
act,
the
congress
said
there
shall
be
no
censorship
by
government,
section
315,
316,
and
in
another
section,
section
315,
it
said
that
there
shall
be
no
interposition
of
a
screen
of
public
opinion
by
a
licensee,
a
broadcaster
in
what
field
only
where
there
was
a
candidate
for
office,
and
no
other
field.
this
is
the
limitations
imposed
in
1927.
and
this
matter
was
considered
in
nebraska,
in
case
of
sorensen
against
wood.
in
most
distinguished
amicus
lawrence
gold
did
a
great
deal
of
work
and
i
am
conceived,
we
argue
upon
the
basis
of
this
factual
situation,
that
there
is
an
equity,
an
equitable
matter
to
be
adjusted
between
broadcasters
and
the
newspapers.
that
it
would
be
inequitable
and
unfair
to
have
a
different
rule
of
law
for
the
two
at
the
two
advertising
mediums,
that
were
then
in
professor
wowl's
concepts
vying
with
each
other.
consequently
sorensen
against
wood
simply
destroys
the
usual
concept
of
the
word
sensor.
sorensen
against
wood
says
that
the
words
and
there
shall
be
no
power
of
censorship
means
that
the
broadcaster
is
obligated
to
sensor.
and
this
must
of
necessity
be
the
petitioner's
position
here,
that
the
broadcaster
is
obligated
to
sensor
in
all
matters
except
in
sorensen
against
wood,
matters
having
political
--
matters
of
political
influence.
now
this
certainly
does
violence
to
the
concept
of
censorship
and
the
word
censorship,
and
it
precipitated
16
as
general
greenbaum
has
said
said,
16
different
attempts
by
the
same
congress,
the
continuing
body,
16
different
attempts
to
solve
the
problem.
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
did
not
say
that
i
think
that
all
congress
has
done
in
these
16
times,
is
to
fail
to
face
the
problem
and
arrive
at
a
thought
out
conclusion.
because
my
preparation
of
this
case
must
of
necessity
be
away
from
the
congressional
record
of
the
debates,
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
that
as
i
should
like
to
be,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
maybe
said
fairly
in
the
brevity
of
moral
argument,
that
congress
has
arrived
at
nothing,
there
has
been
an
argument
here
and
an
argument
there.
now
i
understand
that
amicus,
mr.
anello
will
argue
with
you
that
there
is
something
to
be
spelled
out
in
congress,
and
from
the
lack
of
congressional
action,
as
the
respondent
has
argued
and
the
petitioner
has
argued,
that
there
is
something
to
be
spelled
out,
but
we
most
be
respectfully
assert
that
the
congress
has
failed
to
face
up
to
the
problem.
now
where
is
television
today,
and
this
i
think
is
the
gravamen
of
our
argument.
television,
radio,
electronic
communication,
was
said
by
this
court
to
be
a
dynamic
industry
in
the
pottsville
case.
the
fact
of
it's
dynamism
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
of
our
being
here
and
by
the
truth
of
general
greenbaum's
arguments,
that
it
is
a
deplorable
situation
so
far
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned,
that
we
a
respectable
licensed
broadcaster
attempting
to
discharge
our
obligations
as
a
licensee,
of
the
government
licensing,
are
faced
with
the
problem
of
presenting
a
deliberate
libel
under
circumstances
such
as
this.
i
should
amplify
the
statement
of
fact
made
by
general
greenbaum
just
to
this
extent
and
this
is
in
the
record.
when
mr.
townley
presented
his
case,
his
proposed
writ
to
the
broadcaster,
the
broadcaster
examined
it,
advised
him
that
it
was
in
its
opinion
libelous
and
untrue
and
advised
him
to
believe
it
to
be
untrue,
refused
to
broadcast
it
unless
a
written
demand
was
made,
which
was
made
under
the
provisions
of
section
315,
a
demand
under
the
mandate,
as
broadcaster
understood
it,
and
then
instead
of
putting
townley
on
the
air
live,
as
could
have
been
done,
required
mr.
townley
to
film
his
telecast,
so
there
could
be
no
question
of
an
ad
lib
remark,
the
(inaudible),
required
him
to
film
his
telecast
and
then
film,
and
then
published
it
once,
and
i
most
respectfully
correct
to,
published
it
once
in
accordance
with
its
contract
with
mr.
tommy
and
under
the
mandate
of
315.
this
was
the
action
that
the
broadcaster
was
forced
to
take
under
the
provisions
of
the
court
here
on
decision
and
under
the
provisions
of
the
wdsu
warning,
which
came
after,
the
only
two
things
in
my
view,
the
only
two
concrete
definite
things
that
the
commission
has
done,
regardless
of
the
arguments
pro
and
con
in
the
debates
and
before
the
committees,
the
only
two
things
that
the
broadcaster
is
entitled
and
may
look
to
for
guidance.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes
mr.
justice
we
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
it
is
the
view
of
the
respondent
that
it
may
require
the
script
to
be
submitted
as
it
requires
all
copy,
commercial
copy
whatever
to
be
submitted.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
understand
that
sir,
but
the
script
maybe
submitted
for
examination
as
is
done,
but
properly
so
if
it
not
been
after
examination
excise
--
material
was
excised
from
the
script.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
it
is
justified
generally
in
the
industry
sir
as
an
administrative
procedure
warrant
requiring
the
--
permitting
the
respondent
licensees
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
to
see
that
obscenity
is
not
in
it,
there
are
things
that
will
be
excised
as
the,
as
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
understand.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
and
very
recently
stated.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
think
that
leads
right
into
the
point
i
was
about
to
make
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
--
where
television
is
today,
we
are
now
going
from
1932
to
1959,
this
is
now
the
mass
method
of
communication.
i
am
always,
i
am
close
to
this
industry
as
you
gather,
because
i
have
been
the
lawyer
for
this
industry
for
20
some
years
and
i
am
always
shocked
at
the
lack
of
understanding
of
the
massive
effect
to
this
industry
not
withstanding
the
effect,
the
way
we
protest
the
effect,
but
i
am
shocked
at
the
lack
of
understanding
that
by
people
who
otherwise
i
would
think
were
well
informed.
for
instance,
in
the
leading
article,
in
a
leading
article
in
the
january
issue
of
the
harvard
law
review,
a
very
exhaustive
study
of
the
effect
of
315,
which
had
been
cited
by
all
parties,
the
--
demonstrating
a
study
of
the
problem,
a
surveying
of
the
industry,
not
casual
comments
at
all,
the
authors
start
off
with
this
language
and
i
quote,
“radio
and
television
have
played
an
ever-increasing
role
in
the
conduct
of
election
campaigns.
in
the
1956
campaign,
the
purchase
of
radio
and
television
at
time
was
the
single
greatest
item
of
expense.
the
amount
spent
by
the
two
major
parties
constituted
more
than
30%
of
their
combined
total
cost.”
this
is
the
point.
although
it
is
unclear
whether
political
broadcast
efficiently
influenced
the
election
result
to
justify
such
high
expenditures
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
potential
listening
audience
which
a
candidate
may
now
reach
is
far
in
excess
of
what
it
has
ever
been
in
the
past.
this
--
here
the
product
of
years
of
study
by
men
of
great
capability
presumably
by
a
distinguished
journal
and
yet
an
un
–
a
lack
of
acceptance
of
the
concept
that
this
medium,
and
this
is
where
i
think
we
should
go
to
(inaudible),
this
medium
is
unlike
any
other
art
we
have
had
by
way
of
communication.
this
is,
this
is
near
the
ultimate.
this
is
entitled
then
to
the
consideration
of
this
court
as
a
new
medium,
going
back
to
sorenson.
it
is
not
another
extension
of
newspapers.
this
is
--
we
are
not
--
the
government
is
not
inhibited
by
the
first
amendment.
the
newspapers
are
not
licensed.
we
are
licensed.
this
is
the
need
that
we
face
today.
we
need,
i
submit,
we
need
a
clear
adjudication
of
the
functions
and
the
position
of
the
congressional
statement,
a
clear
interpretation
of
what
congress
meant
when
it
announced
315,
this
is
what
we
need.
now
i
am
aware
i
anticipate.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes,
yes
perhaps.
i
think,
i
think
that
the
statute
clearly
says
there
shall
be
no
power
of
censorship
and
i
think
that
the
court
below,
the
north
dakota
court
in
a
qualified
way
said
that
there
must
be
a
federal
immune
--
must
be
a
flow
of
immunity
from
--
i
mean
it
--
a
correlative
rising
of
a
immunity
flowing
from
this
prohibition,
otherwise
the
respondent
would
be
in
a
position,
the
respondent
yes
would
be
in
a
position
argued
by
the
petitioner
that
section
315
as
applied
to
the
respondent
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
we
are
in
a
position
of
being
required
to
subject
ourselves
to
an
action
for
libel
and
the
--
and
unable
to
protect
ourselves.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
understand
the
course
of
that
argument.
i
think
that
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
the
48
states
or
the
50
states
now
were
to
determine
in
a
peculiarly
interstate
art
what
below
are
libelous.
for
instance,
we
can
perform,
publish
a
libel
in
north
dakota
and
we
reach
north
dakota
and
we
reach
minnesota,
south
dakota,
we
reach
all
of
these
jurisdictions.
the
obligation
to
require
the
broadcaster
to
respond
in
every
one
of
these
jurisdictions
where
it
could
be
reached
or
under
the
(inaudible)
receivership
would
be
impossible.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
am
not
aware
of
situations
with
reference
to
this
kind
of
an
art.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
this
is
our
assumption.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
we
have
absolutely
no
right
of
censorship,
we
disagree
with
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
this
seems
to
be
the
clear
words
of
the
statute,
it
makes
sense
in
1927,
we
know
of
nothing
that
has
changed.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
there
are
many
--
we
have
statutory
provisions
declaring
it
to
be
an
offense,
a
criminal
offense
presumably
deferent
in
certain,
a
criminal
offense
to
commit
certain
acts,
we
--
you
may
not,
we
may
not
have
to
be
citizens,
as
individuals--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes
i
understand
those,
but
this
again
we
get
into
the
preemptive
field
where
presumably
the
congress
says
preempted.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes.
it
seems
to
us
that
we
have
demonstrated
the
massive
effect
of
the
industry.
we
have
demonstrated
our
helplessness
in
effect
in
the
face
of
the
federal
communication's
direct
mandate
to
us.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes
that's
right.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
well
one
must
start
with
the
basic
assumption
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
ours
is
a
government
of
opinioned
people.
we
must
have
--
the
whole
predicate
of
our
government
is
the
free
expression
of
opinion
of
people,
and
it
is
a
dangerous
business
on
a
censor,
whether
he
be
a
broadcaster
or
he
be
a
government,
when
kind
of
censorship,
it
is
a
dangerous
business
when
we
are
called
the
concept
of
censorship
or
as
the
petitioner
would
have
us
do,
would
accept
the
mandate
of
censorship
and
require
us
to
determine
whether
or
not
as
the
dissenting
opinion
said
in
the
court
below,
whether
or
not
this
language
was
germane
to
the
issue.
the
dissenting
justice
said
the
fact
that
this
is
not
--
that
the
farmers
union
is
a
third
party,
and
not--
nothing
can
be
germane
to
the
issue,
but
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
it
is
my
understanding
that
--
and
in
our
brief
and
in
petitioners
brief,
we
cite
the
several
statutes
which
declare
it
a
criminal
offense
to
broadcast
obscene
matter.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes,
and
through
the
mail
and
to
broadcast
it
as
well.
i'm
sorry
that
i
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
well
if
in
that
event
and
of
course
section
3
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
nothing
in
this
actual
--
i'm
reading
section
326.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
section
326
of
the
communications
act.
and
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
section
326,
it's
very
brief,
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
understood
or
construed
to
give
the
commission
the
power
of
censorship
over
the
radio
communications
or
signal
transmitted
by
a
radio
station
and
no
regulation
or
condition
--
no
i
missed
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes
i
see.
oh
yes
the
last
sentence
was
repealed
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i'm
looking
at
page
52
of
the
communications
act.
i
understand.
now
no
person
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
shall
utter
any
obscene,
indecent
or
profane
language
by
means
of
radio
communications.
and
that
was
said
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
mr.
justice
black
that
was
transposed
into
the
criminal
code
and
this
is
why
i'm
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
no.
we
have
interpreted
it
to
mean
that
we
are
a
party
to
the
broadcast
that
is
the
broadcaster,
in
the
nature
of
the
publication
(inaudible)
the
media.
it
says
no
person
within
the
jurisdiction
shall
utter
any
obscene
or
indecent
language.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
no
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
they
have
been
changed
by
the
elimination
of
this
language
of
which
we
are
talking
and
that
was
put
into
the
criminal
code.
this
is
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
well,
if
the
libel,
the
publication
of
the
libel,
reached
into
a
neighboring
state,
minnesota
or
south
dakota,
presumably
the
person
libel,
in
this
case
the
farmer's
union
which
is
a
corporation
in
minnesota,
there
is
a
separate
corporation,
could
well
come
into
north
dakota
and
under
the
diversity
of
citizenship
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
the
state
law.
this
would
--
then
of
course
we
have
a
conventional
libel
statute
and
it
would
govern,
if
section
315
does
not
displace
it.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
if
section
315
is
not
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
that
is
the
burden
of
the
decision
below.
the
decision
below
said.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
we
don't
know.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
it
has
not
been
litigated.
i
mean
my
own
estimate
of
it
that
it
would,
this
would
be
a
privilege
communication.
there
is
a
case
in
north
dakota,
stafney
against
standard
oil
company,
in
which
a
very
similar
question
arose.
the
standard
oil
company
responded
to
an
unemployment
compensation
question
there
as
to
why
stafney
was
discharged,
and
it
wrote
in
answer
to
a
question,
misappropriation
of
funds.
stafney
sued
the
standard
oil
company
in
the
state
courts.
the
state
court
held
that
this
was
pursuant
to
a
--
this
having
to
fit
the
language
to
our
statute,
it
was
pursuant
to
the
--
a
privilege
governmental
order
pursuant
to
a
governmental
order
and
absolved
the
standard
oil
company's
liability.
this
was
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
[attempt
to
laughter]
may
i
answer
this
by
saying
that
criminal
libel
in
north
dakota,
the
truth
is
a
defense.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
what
is
truth
in
any
libel
action,
and
what
whether
or
not
a
matter
is
or
is
not
libelous,
is
peculiar
within
the
province
of
the
jury.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes.
this
is
the
point
that
i'm
getting
at.
well
maybe
i
just
agree
with
you.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
but
the
broadcaster
cannot
conceivably
take
a
set
of
facts
and
know
what
an
eventual
jury
determination
is
going
to
be,
this
is
beyond
this
province.
we
cannot
possibly
determine
what
in
the
sorenson
language,
of
what
is
the
political
importance
of
this
language?
we
cannot
conceivably
in
this
instant
case
finally
determine
as
the
court
–
we
can't
substitute
our
court
--
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
yes.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
have
recently
read
one
of
your
writing
sir
and
--
in
which
you
quote
as
a
proof,
jefferson's
letter
with
reference
to
the
status
of
the
newspapers
to
the
effect
that
after
all
ours
is
a
government
based
upon
people's
opinion.
and
he
had
to
make
the
selection
between
newspapers
with
government
or
government
without
newspapers,
he
would
certainly
take
newspapers
with
government.
mr.
harold
w.
bangert
i
don't
require,
i
don't
recall
the
qualification,
but
–
i
thank
you
for
it.
