in

justice

stewart
well,
as
the
case
is
here
(inaudible)
as
you
pointed
out,
there's
no
issue
as
to
this
man
having
been
a
candidate,
would
it
be
in
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
also
true,
there's
no
issue
as
to
what
he
said
having
been
the
defamatory?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
an
issue
here,
either?
justice

the

(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
now
here
is
my
question
mr.
anello
is
this,
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
you
tell
me
if
i
am,
does
this
case
as
it
comes
to
us
from
the
north
dakota
court,
involve
any
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
as
such
of
section
315?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
in
agreement
with
that
position
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
not
really
arguing
here
that
section
315
is
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down
mr.
anello,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
at
the
very
outset
that
you
disagreed
with
mr.
bangert
to
the
extent
that
it's
your
position
that
under
the
statute,
the
licensee
is
powerless
even
to
censor
--
justice
potter
stewart
hardcore
obscenities
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
conceded
it
seems
â€“
justice
potter
stewart
--
without
getting
into
the
question
of
what
obscenity
may
or
may
not
be.
