mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
certiorari
which
this
court
has
granted
to
review
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
north
dakota.
in
that
action,
the
court
dismissed
a
libel
suit.
the
action
was
a
defendant
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
station,
the
television
station,
wday.
of
course,
under
the
provisions
of
section
315
of
the
communications
act,
there
was
immunity
granted
by
implication
to
the
station.
this
is
the
section
315,
which
grants
equal
opportunity
to
an
opposing
candidate
in
campaigns.
the
section
315
as
in
so
construed
by
the
lower
court
so
as
to
deprive
plaintiffs
including
as
i
did
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
who
as
its
name
implies,
the
farmers
educational
union,
is
of
course
not
a
candidate
for
public
office.
therefore,
we
haven't
checked
this
under
315,
the
issue
as
to
whether
(a)
immunity
is
granted,
and
(b),
if
it's
granted
as
against
the
plaintiffs
who
are
non-candidates.
very
briefly,
the
facts
in
this
case
were
there,
it
involved
the
1956
senatorial
campaigns
in
the
state
of
north
dakota.
the
candidates
were
senator
young
who
is
the
incumbent,
and
mr.
burdick,
who
is
his
opponent.
both
of
these
gentlemen
had
time
granted
to
them
by
this
station,
wday,
in
fargo,
south
dakota.
after
they
had
spoken,
and
doing
their
speech,
as
they
made
no
mention
whatever,
over
the
petitioner,
nor
of
a
man
named,
townley,
who
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
south
dakota,
had
become
a
candidate
for
the
united
states
senate.
under
that
law,
all
that
is
required
is
300
votes
to
qualify
a
person
as
a
candidate.
there's
no
doubt
and
we
do
not
dispute
that
townley
was
a
qualified
candidate,
entitled
to
the
provisions
of
equal
opportunity
under
section
315.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes
(voice
overlap)
petition.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
300
votes
will
enable
a
candidate
to
be
nominated.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes.
in
this
case,
the
two
other
candidates,
that
is
senator
young
and
mr.
burdick
had
spoken.
now,
what
did
mr.
townley
say?
you
will
find
on
page
2
of
the
transcript
had
said.
now,
i
just
like
to
take
the
liberty,
your
honor,
to
call
attention
of
few
other
things
he
said
to
his
audience,
north
dakota
republican
farmers,
bankers
and
businessmen.
the
first
paragraph,
“the
farmers
union
--
i
will
paraphrase
it,
“dictators
would
establish
a
communist
farmers
union
soviet
right
here
in
north
dakota.”
then
in
the
third
paragraph,
we
will
see
in
the
fourth
line
they
called
our
client,
a,
communist
viper.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
they
are
talking
about
young
and
burdick,
the
two
opponents,
both
of
these
men
take
orders
from
communist
controlled
democratic
farmers
union.
and
then
near
the
end,
do
you
both
walk
hand
in
hand
with
communist
farmers
union?
if
you
do,
the
(inaudible)
and
then
the
end,
reason
to
make
and
to
other
stations,
7:30
to
9:30
every
night
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
no,
sir.
we
admit
that.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
admitted.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well,
that's
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
appeal,
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
those
facts
are
admitted
on
the
record.
this
speech
was
given
according
to
the
complaint
here
to
listeners,
thousands
of
listeners,
the
complaint
alleged,
not
only
in
the
state
for
south
dakota
and
north
dakota,
but
also
south
dakota
and
minnesota,
where
the
candidates
obviously
were
not
running
for
public
office.
the
statement
that
appeared
then
was
transferred
into
an
act
arising
out
of
these
facts.
but
first,
the
station
admitted
when
the
script
was
given
to
it
that
it
didn't
like
the
script.
it
--
i
can't
say
rejected
it,
but
it
told
the
candidate
that
it
was
objectionable
because
it's
libelous.
it
would
be
found
that
in
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
found
at
the
top
of
page
32
of
the
record
that
--
36
of
the
record,
it
is
conceded
by
the
defendant,
wday,
that
the
language
in
the
townley
speech
complained
of
by
the
plaintiff
is
libelous
per
se.
the
defendant
pleaded
not
only
in
this
statute
but
the
statute
of
the
state
of
south
--
of
north
dakota
that
gave
us
immunity.
that
was
demurred
to,
and
the
demurrer
in
that
case
was
sustained.
it
was
not
appealed.
the
second
ground
of
demurrer
was
on
the
ground
of
section
315,
which
is
the
provision
that
brings
this
action
before
this
court.
it
was
alleged
that
under
the
rules
of
the
federal
communications
committee,
this
station
would
be
up
for
a
relicense
every
three
years
and
under
the
rule
to
that
commission,
at
the
end
of
three
years,
the
court
would
look
into
the
fact
just
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
station
had
operated
satisfactorily
during
the
three-year
period
and
by
decision,
it
was
rendered
by
that
court
--
case
of
the
court
(inaudible)
it
was
held
that
a
station
under
the
provisions
of
315
was
not
entitled
to
examine
or
to
--
libelous
materials
and
that
the
station
was
exempt,
immune
from
liability.
it
is
our
contention
at
section
315
admittedly,
providing
no
such
immunity,
explicitly,
that
does
not
provide
immunity
by
implication
and
next,
if
it
does,
in
no
event
that
any
such
immunity
applied
to
the
petitioner
or
any
other
third
person
who
is
not
a
candidate
for
public
office,
and
my
third
point
is
that
if
it
does
held
in
such
a
way,
then
in
that
event
it
is
our
contention
that
the
statute
i
so
construed
is
unconstitutional
as
against
this
petitioner.
now,
in
1920
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon?
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
oh.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
if
--
if
there
is
immunity
granted
to
the
station
that
do
--
do
have
as
a
broadcast
as
in
this
one,
wday
and
if
its
applied
to
a
third
person,
your
honor,
like
the
plaintiff,
the
farmers
educational
union,
which
is
not
in
any
circumstances,
admittedly,
a
candidate
for
public
office.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
we
claim
that
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
when
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
they
will
take
its
property
as
reputation,
a
way
without
due
process
of
law
and
would
deprive
it
of
its
right
to
bring
an
action.
we
concede
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well,
it
is
not
our
contention
that
congress
did
say
that
a
state
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes,
we
could
--
we
would
say
that
in
that
circumstance,
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
all
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
right.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
and
that's
particularly
applicable
in
this
case
where
we
are
providing
for
rights
on
new
art,
television
and
radio
as
the
parties,
one
candidate
against
another,
might
concededly
readmit,
although
the
congress
might
have
the
power
to
take
action
there.
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
is
our
feeling
that
that
would
not
be
applicable
to
a
case
of
this
candidate,
this
petitioner,
who
is
not
a
candidate.
can
i
stop
now,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
--
this
was
required
to
run
in
north
dakota,
i
understood
your
question
was
how
many
votes.
there
is
no
primary
at
this
filing
of
a
petition
there.
and
i
could
say
i
haven't
done
well
and
i
have
a
little
trouble
hearing
so
i
apologize
for
that.
as
we
were
indicating
a
moment
ago
the
situation
in
this
case
is
that
in
1927,
this
statute
was
passed
and
this
is
the
first
time
nearly
a
third
of
a
century
that
this
case
has
come
before
this
court.
the
act
at
that
time
when
the
statute
was
passed
had
no
such
thing
as
television,
radio
we
might
say
just
been
born,
television
had
been
conceived
but
wasn't
born
and
then
the
intervening
period
of
time
we've
had
various
cases
that
have
come
up.
and
just
very
briefly
to
give
the
court
a
picture
of
what's
happened.
the
statutes
that
are
quoted
in
our
brief
on
pages
2
and
3
and
pages
2,
it's
the
statute
315
which
is
presently
before
you.
the
big
purpose
of
this
statute
was
of
course
to
give
equal
time
to
the
opposing
candidate.
a
new
concept
had
entered
into
the
american
field
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
for
this
court
in
the
case
of
nbc
against
fcc,
we
had
a
unique
situation
where
the
time
was
limited,
and
therefore
for
the
first
time
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
in
our
history
we
did
have
a
need
and
rightly
so
for
control.
so
315
sir
in
the
early
days
there
that
if
any
licensee
shall
permit
a
political
opponent
to
have
the
right
to
use
of
the
station,
the
other
time,
the
other
candidate
must
be
granted
equal
time
and
that
is
the
question
before
us
now,
that
--
into
that
statute
has
been
read
the
provision
that
the
equal
time
allows
immunity
to
the
station.
it
is
our
contention
that
what
congress
was
saying
was,
you
do
not
have
to
give
equal
time
to
anybody
but
if
you
do
then
you
must
let
the
opponent
or
in
this
case
the
opponents
have
equal
opportunities
to
answer.
at
the
same
time
the
statute
contained
two
other
provisions.
you
will
notice
on
page
2
of
our
brief
that
proviso
provided
that
such
licensee
shall
have
no
power
censorship
over
the
material
broadcast.
and
on
the
following
page,
page
3,
it
is
stated
in
the
section
326
at
the
top
of
the
page
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
interfere
with
--
i
am
sorry,
414
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
in
anyway
abridge
or
alter
the
remedies
now
existing
either
at
common
law
or
by
statute.
the
fact
is,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
spite
of
these
provisions,
the
court
in
south
dakota
has
granted
immunity
to
the
television
station
and
has
said
that
there
is
no
responsibility
on
its
part.
it
is
our
contention
going
back
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
indicated
before
lunch
that
whether
or
not
congress
could
have
done
this,
whether
it
had
the
statutory
power
and
as
our
opponents
say
it
could
have
done
it
by
the
stroke
of
the
pen,
the
fact
is
that
it
never
took
that
stroke
of
that
pen.
indeed
when
the
first
section
was
passed
by
the
united
states
senate,
i
am
talking
now
of
315,
it
did
include
an
immunity
provision.
there
was
considerable
debate
about
that
in
the
senate
and
then
in
conference
it
was
stricken
out.
and
since
that
time
16
different
times,
congress
has
been
asked
to
and
16
different
times
congress
has
refused
to
grant
this
immunity.
very
briefly
the
history
of
the
section
and
what's
happened
on
it
since
then
is
this.
in
1932,
that's
the
period
of
five
years
the
first
case
arose,
this
in
nebraska,
the
case
was
sorenson
against
wood
and
that
court
held
that
there
is
no
immunity
there
and
therefore
it
held
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
held
the
television
station
libel.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
it
would
always
be
under
the
state
law
your
honor
but
as
far
as
we
can
see
the
argument
presently
made,
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
the
federal
statute
gives
what
is
called,
if
i
may
use
the
language
there,
a
federal
immunity
which
means
the
federal
--
and
as
the
field
of
libel
which
of
course
is
definitely
a
state
function
and
by
entering
that
field,
immunity
is
granted.
so
i
am
unable
to
answer
your
question.
i
leave
better
than
by
saying
immunity
is
granted
under
the
federal
statute
of
315.
in
other
words,
the
state
law
has
been
infringed
upon
by
the
congress
on
that.
things
went
along,
what
i
would
call,
rather
quietly
on
this
particular
front
to
1932
till,
when
the
sorenson
case
was
decided,
till
1948.
in
fact
we
could
add
the
prior
five
years
to
that
and
say
from
'37
to
'48
a
period
of
21
years
when
this
question
was
more
or
less
quiet.
then
in
1948
after
the
commission,
federal
communications
commission
held
that
case
to
two-and-a-half
years,
it
decided
that
the
statute
of
315
granted
not
only
immunity,
but
deferred
and
prevented
the
stations
from
deleting
or
excluding
exercising
libelous
matter.
that
case
arose
in
connection
with
a
station
that
was
up,
for
its
three
year
renewal
license.
as
we
indicated
before
every
three
years
a
station
has
to
ask
for
permission
to
go
on.
the
station
was
rather
forcibly
we
might
say
slapped
on
the
wrist
due
to
the
fact
that
the
station
in
a
campaign
before
had
refused
to
give
political
campaign
time
to
any
candidate.
so
we
might
say
and
completely
over
to
dicta
if
you
can
use
that
expression
for
the
commission,
it
granted
a
renewal
even
though
it
scolded
the
station
and
said
two
important
things,
the
station
is
not
permitted
to
delete
a
libel,
and
two
it
said
the
station
is
granted
immunity.
i
don't
think
it
would
take
the
commission
two-and-a-half
years
to
decide
that
case,
but
it
was
a
very
split
decision.
the
dissenting
commissioner
jones
called
the
decision
unnecessary
and
he
also
said
the
language
about
immunity
was
extremely
dangerous.
he
said
and
predicted
that
unscrupulous
candidates
could
use
this
statute
as
thus
construed
as
a
weapon
to
bait
labor
and
capital
and
dispense
subversive
division
in
the
southern
states,
he
didn't
say
the
southern
states,
and
elsewhere.
a
few
decades
later
after
this
case
came
up,
there
was
an
action
brought
by
another
station
in
texas.
the
question
there
was
as
to
whether
or
not
the
fcc
could
be
restrained
from
enforcing
this
action.
the
fcc,
if
i
may
use
the
expression,
turned
turtle
and
ran
away
from
its
own
decision.
it
said
that
it
wasn't
any
official
ruling.
this
was
an
interpretation
in
an
opinion
that
was
given.
and
the
supreme
court
in
houston,
texas
said
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
case,
no
power
in
the
case
because
the
ruling
of
the
fcc
was
as
the
commission
itself
said
not
a
binding
ruling.
very
shortly
after
i
believe,
a
few
days
after,
the
houston
post
case
the
question
came
before
congress.
there
was
appointed
a
special
committee
to
investigate
the
federal
communications
commission.
at
that
time
the
chairman
of
fcc
was
mr.
wayne
coy
who
also
ran
away
from
this
decision
on
the
port
huron
case
before
the
congressional
committee.
he
said
that
no
one
will
have
any
trouble
who
denies
a
candidate
the
right
to
what
anyone
would
hold
debate
a
defamatory
statement.
congress
then
reported
or
this
committee
of
congress
reported
to
the
congress
that
fcc
is
not
planning
to
enforce
this
and
the
whole
matter
should
be
looked
into
further,
1948
that
was.
things
went
along,
i
can't
say
this
time
rather
quietly
a
little
bit
hectically,
until
1951.
then
in
the
case
of
wdsu
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes
your
honor
they
did
and
indicated
as
i
said
in
the
report,
indicated
that
the
matter
they
had
received
assurances
from
wayne
coy
and
the
reference
to
it
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
it
was
stated
by
mr.
coy
and
i'm
referring
now
to
page
17.
you
will
it
at
the
bottom
of
16
and
then
17.
the
chairman
of
the
committee
said
we
expect
you
to
enforce
the
laws
laid
down
by
the
congress
in
protecting
the
rights
of
political
candidates,
but
on
the
other
hand
we're
a
little
bit
concerned,
and
i
might
say
deeply
concerned
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
i'm
reading
our
brief
at
page
16,
on
the
lower
left
hand
corner.
i
might
say
deeply
concerned
in
the
light
of
this
port
huron
case
that
some
broadcasters
may
fear
the
loss
of
their
licenses
if
they
deny
a
candidate
the
right
to
make
what
anyone
would
construe
is
a
libelous
statement
and
he
asks
for
assurance
that,
that
would
be
done
and
as
you
will
see
on
the
top
of
17
the
assurance
came
from
the
chairman
mr.
coy
and
the
report
to
congress
indicated
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
they
did
have
a
feeling,
not
only
a
feeling,
the
assurance
that
no
immediate
action
would
be
taken.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
what
the
position
that
he
took
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
when
i
said
congress
i
meant
this
committee
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes
they
did.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
he
did
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
(inaudible)
as
indicated
on
page
17,
any
capricious
action
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well
the
answer
is
your
honor
that,
that's
the
position
that
they
took.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
nor
me.
i
am
on
the
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well
if
your
honor,
please
i
think
the
decision
in
the
case
that
he
was
taking
about
part
sure
on
was
doing
it,
whether
you
call
it
capricious
or
not,
if
a
station
was
to
take
action,
by
broadcasting
something,
by
taking
out
something
that
is
libelous,
that
was
to
be
condemned
by
fcc.
i
think
that's
what
he
meant
by
the
word
capricious.
in
other
words
huston,
not
houston,
the
port
huron
case
had
said
specifically
that
no
station
may
delete
and
if
they
do
we
will
deny
them
the
right
to
have
a
license.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that
is
referred
to
at
page
11
in
our
reply
brief
in
which
the
congress
said
that
i
am
asking
no
recommendations
about
it
here
because
it
is
not
included
in
the
legislation,
this
is
what
wayne
coy
says.
then
congress
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes
in
the
original
action
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
right
in
the
original
act
of
1927
and
we've
laid
out
the
different
points
now.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well
i
can
just
report
what
the
facts
are
as
we
have
been
reading
them.
the
facts
are
that
after
this
assurance
about
the
no
capricious
action
then
the
committee
of
congress
reported
to
congress
the
facts
as
given
by
mr.
wayne
coy.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that
would
be
on
page
19
if
your
honor
please
that
--
of
our
report
here.
where
is
that?
we're
talking,
i'm
sorry
19
of
the
report
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
which
we
refer
to
by
cross
reference
and
that--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
in
our
petition,
the
earlier
petition.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
and
the
court
there
reported
the
question
of
--
there
is
in
1948,
on
19
if
you
see
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
that's
the
reference
that
we
have
to
it
there.
the
question
of
immunity
of
broadcasters
from
liability
was
the
principle
subject
matter
of
those
hearings
and
no
legislation
was
recommended.
there
is
no
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
right,
at
that
time.
i
have
no
specific
reference
that
i
can
give
you,
other
than
the
action
there
as
to
what
they
did.
they
got
the
assurance,
they
heard
it
wasn't
capricious
and
they
did
nothing.
in
other
words
we
say
that,
that
is
action.
that
is
taking
the
action
before
the
court
by
the
senate
saying
no,
we
will
not
grant
this
amendment,
we
will
not
give
this.
the
next
case
that
came
on,
which
was
before
the
federal
communication
commission
your
honor
was
wdsu
in
1951
and
in
that
case
the
court
repeated
what
it
had
said
three
years
before
under
1948
case
and
it
said
that
if
a
commission,
if
the
commission
finds
as
it
had
the
right
to
find
in
cases,
that
there
was
such
action
taken,
then
in
that
event
the
station
would
be
denied
it's
renewal,
and
that's
on
the
three-year
statute
and
that
was
pleaded
in
our
present
case
as
the
ground
for
this
to
defendant,
this
radio,
television
station
for
its
right,
as
it
claims,
both
to
reject
the
script
on
this
case
and
in
its
defense
to
get
to
immunity
for
the
action
that
was
subsequently
brought.
now
the
action
of
this
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
our
argument
is
that
they
should
be,
yes
your
honor
but
not
that
they
have
been.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes.
but
that
has
been
directly
held
against
in
the
cases
i
said,
including
the
1951
wdsu
case
and
was
pleaded
by
this
defendant
as
an
answer.
the
consequence
of
this
is
this
defendant
wday,
which
is
one
of
the
oldest
radio
and
now
television
station,
has
said
that
we
regret
that
our
facilities
have
been
forced
to
become
the
subject
of
a
libel
suit
and
may
again
be
under
the
law,
and
then
they
say
however
that,
that
is
our
defense
that
the
commission
fcc
says
that,
that
is
the
consequence
of
this
section
315
and
accordingly
we
are
not
responsible.
the
language
i've
quoted
from
this
on
in
their
brief,
in
which
they
refer
to
this
and
it
is
our
contention.
well
i
may
put
it
this
way,
that
the
very
attitude
of
this
station
indicates
what
will
be
the
future
of
this
whole
tremendously
broad
program.
here
you
have
a
medium,
first
radio
and
now
television
which
means
it
can
reach
as
you
all
know
many
millions,
in
the
last
year
speech
of
president
roosevelt
was
said
to
have
reached
a
limit
of
over
60
million
people
at
one
time,
this
vast
powerful
huge
medium
is
now
placed
from
the
position
whereby
the
irresponsible
person,
the
speaker
was
worthless,
who
has
no
interest
in
any
financial
responsibility
is
given
the
absolute
right
to
get
on
this
radio,
get
on
this
television,
as
this
defendant
did
in
this
case.
now
the
defendant
i
mean
the
individual
defendant
townley
who
was
sued,
as
well
as
the
radio
station.
what
he
does
in
this
case,
he
virtually
walks
into
the
station
and
he
says
i
want
to
be
--
the
speech
televised.
the
station
says
this
is
libel
and
we
can't
do
it.
he
says,
“i
am
candidate
for
others.
i
have
my
300
signatures
and
i
am
entitled
to
have
my
rights
protected
under
315.”
so
he
said
that
all
he
can
do
is
–
he
sits
there,
gets
himself
photographed,
has
himself
put
on
television
and
just
leaves,
he
wasn't
even
there
when
the
broadcast
was
given.
and
this
speech
of
his,
this
commercial
of
his
is
played
in
the
morning,
in
the
afternoon
and
the
evening
of
october
29th
and
he
says
you
can't
do
anything
about
it.
it
is
our
contention
that
any
such
interpretation
of
315
is
extreme.
it
attacks
the
rights
of
the
individual
who
is
not
a
candidate
as
far
as
the
individual
who
has,
including
in
our
case
the
farmers
educational
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
they
are
called,
as
you
saw
before,
a
communist
organization
who
are
suppressive
to
the
right,
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
whom
they're
representing
in
the
sense
that
they
are
getting
membership
from
them
and
that
station
not
a
candidate,
no
right
to
reply,
not
even
mentioned
in
315
that
station
can
be
libel
with
immunity
by
this
huge
new
giant
medium
of
communication
that
we've
created
since
1926
when
this
statute
was
drawn
up.
and
our
contention
would
be
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well
we
couldn't
have
enjoined
them.
we
could
have
sued
them.
they
certainly
couldn't
claim
immunity
and
the
comparison
with
the
newspaper
goes
back
to
–
we
were
talking
about
before
lunch
on
a
constitutional
point
that
if
a
radio
station,
this
particular
one,
wdsy,
had
printed
as
it
did
this
broadcast
and
suppose
the
statute
requires
for
some
reason
or
another
that
a
newspaper
must
publish
this.
would
the
newspaper
be
exempt
from
libel?
the
question
here
would
be,
we
submit,
a
pertinent
illustration
of
the
inequity
of
a
provision
if
it
wouldn't
print.
but
if
it
could
be
held
that
section
315
is
a
very
unusual
and
a
very
unique
concept,
it
makes,
it
compels
a
station
to
give
equal
time
to
the
other
side,
equal
opportunity.
now
that
concept
sounds
now
after
a
third
of
a
century,
it's
only
the
way
we
are
used
to,
we
have
nothing
like
that,
your
honor,
in
the
newspaper
world,
we
have
nothing
like
that
in
any
field
of
written
communication.
and
we
say
that
such
a
statute
couldn't
conceivably
have
given
the
right
to
a
newspaper
or
as
in
this
case
we
have
here
a
television
station
to
be
exempt
from
liability.
why
not,
why
should
it
be
because
this
new
man,
the
third
person,
the
candidate,
he
might
be
the
second
candidate
comes
in
and
he
says
we
want
the
right
to
speak.
here
is
my
speech
and
i
want
to
talk
about
it,
anything
i
want
and
you
can't
exercise
the
power
of
censorship.
it
is
our
contention
that
any
such
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
a
misinterpretation.
the
defendant
in
this
case
or
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
associated
with
it
several
amici
curiae.
one
of
them
in
this
case
we
will
hear
from
shortly
is
a
national
association
of
broadcasters.
they
took
a
position
before
this
situation
arose
in
which
they
say
that
there
was
no
right
on
the
part
of
any
station
to
be
compelled
to
issue
a
broadcast
because
a
candidate
walked
into
the
station
and
asked
for
it.
they
contended
in
the
case
of
port
huron
and
later
on
before
the
federal
communications
commission,
and
later
on
before
the
congress
that
the
statute
said
just
what
we
say
it
said.
now
they
are
sitting
here
today
and
they
will
tell
you
that
the
position
we
take
is
wrong.
they
will
tell
you
that
the
station
is
given
immunity
and
they
will
tell
you
that
the
station
can
delete
from
its
publication
--
cannot
delete
from
its
publication
anything
that's
libel.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
we
agree.
we
agree
with
that
and
we
say
in
this
case
there
is
no
compulsion
on
the
station's
part.
when
i
say
there
is
no
power
of
censorship,
we
contend
that
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
we
contend
--
we
agree
with
that
and
315
does
this.
it's
an
equality
of
time
and
equality
of
opportunity
statute.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that
comes
in
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that
means
what
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
the
question
of
what
the
word
censor
means
coming
from
the
roman
language,
censor,
a
government
official.
now
the
congress
has
very
rightly
put
into
315
you
can't
do
certain
thing,
and
one
of
the
things
you
can't
do
is
to
censor.
now
what
does
the
word
censor
mean?
you
can't
give
this
man,
what
this
congress
wants
to
do,
the
equal
opportunity
on
the
radio
if
you
are
saying,
no
you
can't
say
that,
oh
no,
nothing
to
do
with
this.
and
therefore
as
it
was
decided
in
the
sorenson
case
in
the
five
years
after
the
statute
passed,
no
censorship
means
the
trend
of
his
ideas
on
social,
economic,
religious
and
other
questions
but
not
on
the
question
of
libelous,
not
on
the
question
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
no
we
can
get
to
the
beginning
of
the
answer.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
i
think
we
got
the
beginning
of
the
answer
there.
it's
very
unusual
to
use
the
word
‘censor'
to
someone
else
and
congress
maybe
had
a
difficult
time
in
deciding
how
to
phrase
this,
but
the
meaning
is
clear.
it
was
--
it
couldn't
have
anything
libelous,
and
it
couldn't
have
anything
obscene,
couldn't
have
anything
blasphemous
for
provisions
in
the
communications
act
that
specially
says
that?
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
the
statute
says
that
elsewhere.
it
says
that
you
cannot
say
a
thing.
suppose
one
of
the
candidate
said,
if
i
am
elected
president
of
the
united
states
i
will
come
down
to
washington
and
do
this,
that
and
other
thing
to
the
president,
there's
specific
provision
in
the
statute.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
the
communications
act,
it
says
you
can't
threaten
the
life
of
the
president.
that's
in
the
act
and
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
that's
true.
we
contend
and
that's
what
the
court
below
held.
the
court
below
held
that
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well
there
can
be
a
difference
of
opinion
but
that
is
our
contention
if
your
honor
please.
i
just
want
to
say
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
well
it
is
our
contention
that
in
the
connection
what
your
honor
spoke
about
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court
below
and
conceded
on
the
other
side,
you
can't
say
anything
blasphemous
and
you
can't
say
anything
that
violates
the
terms
of
the
assessment.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
the
statute
doesn't
say
so,
but
the
court
--
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
greenbaum
there
wasn't,
the
word
wasn't
in
the
statute
about
blasphemous.
i
am
familiar
i
think
with
the
cases
your
honor
has
in
mind,
just
one
word
in
closing
if
i
may
sir?
we
are
not
against
a
broad
use
of
television
or
radio
in
the
field
of
communications
of
a
campaign.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
statute
as
construed
by
the
defendants
in
this
case
does
not
lend
to
that
construction.
it
is
our
belief
that
this
--
if
this
judgment
is
affirmed
it
will
restrict
and
not
narrow
the
field
for
these
two
versions,
first
restricted
at
the
station
like
wday,
fear
the
public
opinion
as
well
as
they
fear
and
rightly
so,
that
a
monetary
damage
too.
and
the
other
reason
is
that
we
feel
that
they
would
not
be
deterred
by
feelings
of
that
kind,
that
they
want
to
carry
out
the
honest
intention
of
giving
everybody
his
right
to
say
things,
but
not
defamatory
things
as
they
themselves
say
they
regretted
here.
and
we
think
this
statute
if
affirmed
would
open
up
the
doors
for
a
field
day
for
the
future
hitlers
and
stalins
that
will
arise
in
this
country.
they
will
get
free
from
any
liability,
except
on
their
own
part
and
they
have
none,
stations
such
as
this
one
and
4,000
others
throughout
the
country,
we
contend
that
the
case
should
be
reversed.
