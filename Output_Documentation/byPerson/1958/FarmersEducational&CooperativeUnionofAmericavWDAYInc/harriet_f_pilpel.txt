ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
some
of
the
sessions
have
gotten
away
from
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
under
section
315,
station
wday,
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
immune
from
damages
for
broadcasting
material
which
was
admittedly
libelous
about
our
client,
the
farmers
educational
and
cooperative
union
of
north
dakota.
as
mr.
bangert
said
in
his
argument,
congress
has
not
conferred
any
immunity
from
such
a
suit
as
this,
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
indicated
in
his
question,
over
and
over
again
congress
has
been
asked
to
legislate
this
immunity
and
over
and
over
again
congress
has
refused
so
to
legislate.
mr.
anello
who
immediately
preceded
me,
gave
reasons
why
he
did
not
think
the
congress
could
be
said
to
have
acted
against
immunity
in
this
situation,
but
in
a
brief
filed
by
his
own
association,
a
little
over
ten
years
ago,
which
i
have
in
my
hands
and
which
was
submitted
to
the
congress
in
connection
with
the
hearings
on
the
port
huron
case,
he
said
it
seems
equally
certain
that
they
did
not
--
that
congress
determined
to
say
out
of
the
field
of
defamation
and
to
leave
the
state
laws
on
libel
and
slander
untouched.
there
is
no
provision
in
section
315,
which
confers
any
immunity
on
a
radio
or
television
station
for
broadcasting
libelous
remarks.
there
is
another
provision
in
the
federal
communication
act,
namely
section
414
which
states
specifically
that
the
act
shall
not
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
abridge
or
alter
the
remedies
now
existing
at
common
law
or
by
statute,
but
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
be
in
addition
to
such
remedy.
by
arguing
as
we
found
that
mr.
anello
does,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
totally
over
list
the
existence
of
section
414
and
read
into
section
315,
words
which
are
obviously
not
there.
i
say
obviously
not
there
because
as
has
been
apparent
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
there
have
been
repeated
efforts
to
put
them
there.
this
is
not
a
case
of
congress
having
not
acted.
it's
a
case
in
which
congress
acted
by
refusing
to
legislate
immunity.
no
one
had
even
made
any
contention
that
broadcasters
were
immune
from
liability,
until
1948
in
the
famous
port
huron
case
which
we've
already
discussed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
three
years
before
that,
the
commission
itself
had
expressed
great
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
an
immunity
existed
in
the
bellingham
case
and
had
specifically
tabled
that
question
and
said
we
are
not
called
upon
to
decide
whether
there
is
an
immunity
under
state
law
or
not.
when
the
port
huron
case
came
along
there
followed
the
congressional
hearing
which
we
have
already
discussed,
then
the
case
of
wdsu
reiterated
port
huron
about
the
meaning
of
censorship,
but
did
not
categorically
assert
that
there
was
an
immunity.
as
i
recall
the
words
of
the
commission
in
the
wdsu,
there
was
something
like
whatever
maybe
the
rule
as
to
immunity
we
hope
such
and
such
as
the
censorship.
shortly
after
the
decision
in
the
port
huron
case,
there
were
further
considerations
of
the
matter
in
congress
and
the
house
tax
and
immunity
amendment
which
was
rejected
again
in
1952
by
the
conference
committee,
and
this
time
in
report
number
2426
82d
cong.,
2d
session,
which
is
cited
on
page
ten
of
our
reply
brief,
the
committee
of
conference
stated
very
definitely
what
it
thought
it
was
doing.
and
i
quote
what
they
said,
“the
committee
of
conference
agreed
to
omit
the
provision
with
respect
to
liability
of
licensees
in
civil
or
criminal
actions
because
these
subjects
had
not
been
adequately
studied
by
the
committees
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
of
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives.
the
proposal
was
adopted
in
the
house
after
the
bill
had
been
reported
from
the
house
committee.
the
proposal
involves
many
difficult
problems
and
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
committee
of
conference
that
it
should
be
acted
on
only
after
full
hearing
has
been
held.”
since
that
time
identical
bills
have
been
introduced
into
congress
on
either
six
or
seven
occasions
and
on
each
such
occasion
congress
has
expressly
refused
to
legislate
the
immunity
which
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
held
existed
in
this
case.
apparently
no
one
seriously
denied
this
congressional
history
but
the
allegation
is
that
you
can
infer
immunity
from
the
no
censorship
provision
of
section
315
in
the
teeth
of
congressional
refusal
to
declare
immunity.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
address
myself
to
a
few
questions
which
came
out
in
the
course
of
the
discussions
that
preceded
my
getting
up.
one
was
mr.
bangert's
statement
about
the
(inaudible)
of
having
48
or
now
50
different
laws
of
libel.
i
am
sure
it's
not
necessary
to
call
to
the
attention
of
this
court
that
in
all
of
broadcasting,
except
possibly
under
section
315,
there
are
48
or
50
different
state
laws
of
libel
which
apply.
mr.
bangert
argues
the
case
as
if
he
were
pleading
for
a
federal
law
of
defamation
applicable
to
all
television
and
radio
broadcasting.
there
is
no
such
federal
law.
congress
has
not
chosen
to
act,
even
assuming
it
had
the
power
to
act.
what
the
licensee
does
everyday
is
to
act
with
reference
to
the
laws
of
48
or
50
different
states?
furthermore
as
to
whether
the
prohibition
of
section
315
on
censorship
is
absolute,
which
some
of
your
honors
have
asked,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
in
two
instances
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
absolute.
in
the
first
place
it
quoted
with
approval
and
we
cite
that
--
this
appears
on
page
37
of
the
record,
the
statement
of
the
federal
communications
commission
itself
indicating
that
the
censorship
--
the
no
censorship
provision
is
not
absolute.
the
commission
said
and
i
quote
here
on,
“nothing
in
this
opinion
is
intended
to
indicate
that
a
licensee
is
necessarily
without
power
to
present
to
broadcast
of
statements
or
utterances
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
the
communications
act
or
any
other
federal
law
on
broadcast
coming
within
the
requirement
of
section
315
of
the
communications
act.”
i
don't
believe
the
commission
has
ever
retreated
from
that
position.
the
second
thing
that
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
did
by
way
of
i
think
revolt
against
its
own
apparently
absolute
standard
was
to
say
in
its
judgment
on
(inaudible)
not
that
the
station
could
not
--
was
immune
for
all
statements
but
only
that
the
stations
were
immune
from
liability
for
defamatory
statements
made
by
candidates,
and
the
exact
words
of
the
court,
the
judgments
are
“where
such
statements
are
germane
to
the
political
issues
discussed
by
such
candidates,”
this
appears
at
the
top
of
the
page
52
of
the
record.
we
submit
that
the
standard
of
germaness
which
apparently
was
used
by
the
court
below
is
a
standard
which
would
clearly
be
in
violation
of
the
no
censorship
provisions
of
section
315.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
true
of
any
standard
which
would
permit
a
licensee
to
continue
to
function
in
accordance
with
state
law
that
is
to
refuse
to
aid
and
abet
the
commission
of
an
act
in
the
state
which
would
violate
either
the
civil
or
the
criminal
law
of
the
state.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
your
honor
it
would
definitely
still
be
our
position
that
the
station
is
libel
because
we
believe
that
the
two
of
--
the
innocence
of
the
station
totally
overlooks
the
innocence
of
the
third
party
plaintiff
which
is
whom
we
are
representing.
if
we
take
--
if
the
congress
has
created
a
situation
in
which
the
station
is
impudent
to
delete
libels
then
we
are
faced
with
two
innocent
third
parties.
the
station
is
one
innocent
third
party
and
the
innocent
bystander
is
the
other
innocent
third
party.
now
the
station
is
in
my
opinion
far
more
likely
--
should
be
the
one
on
whom
liability
is
accessed
as
between
the
two
for
many
reasons.
in
the
first
place
no
one
has
mentioned
that
section
315
specifically
states
that
no
station
shall
be
under
any
obligation
to
take
any
political
candidates'
broadcast.
so
if
it
does
not
wish
to
be
riddled
with
liability
in
such
a
situation.
it
can
simply
refuse
to
accept
any
political
candidates'
broadcast.
in
the
second
place,
we
believe
that
the
station
is
in
a
position
where
it
could
protect
itself
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
a
situation
in
which
your
honor
mentioned.
for
example
it
could
ask
the
candidate
to
set
--
to
put
up
a
bond,
an
indemnity
bond
so
that
if
the
station
would
have
libel,
it
would
have
some
protection
on
the
indemnity
bond
of
the
candidate.
the
third
party
can't
possibly
do
that
because
he
doesn't
know
it's
going
to
be
this
third
party.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
purpose
of
section
315
was
to
create
equal
opportunities
among
political
candidates,
and
therefore
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
if
there
were
no
discrimination
in
this
requirement,
if
the
station
elected
to
take
political
broadcast,
political
candidate's
broadcast
and
said
to
all
political
candidates
still
on
your
honor's
assumption
that
they
can't
take
out
libel.
this
puts
us
in
a
position
where
we
maybe
responsible
in
damages.
i
see
no
reason
why
i
could
not
equally
say
to
all
such
candidates
we
will
ask
you
for
the
indemnity
bonds.
and
--
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
we
don't
believe
there's
anything
in
the
act.
we
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
somewhat
seem
to
us
rather
unclear
expressions
of
opinion
on
the
part
of
the
commission,
there
has
been
some
doubt
expressed
as
to
whether
this
would
be
equal
treatment
of
candidates
with
all
other
speakers.
but
we
feel
that
every
statute
must
be
given
a
reasonable
interpretation
that
if
your
honors
should
feel
that
no
censorship
means
no
right
to
delete
the
libel
and
since
as
we
submit
there
is
no
immunity,
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
if
all
candidates
were
equally
required
to
put
up
a
bond,
but
even
if
we
are
wrong
on
that,
the
station
could
still
protect
itself
in
a
third
way
namely
by
taking
out
insurance.
the
fact
is
that
many
stations
are
presently
covered
with
insurance
and
while
it
is
true
that
if
your
honors
would
hold
the
way
you've
indicated
it
might
be
that
the
insurance
would
get
more
expensive.
the
fact
we
have
ended,
it's
quite
inexpensive
now
and
even
if
it
become
more
expressive
political
candidate
business
is
a
very
profitable
business.
our
brief
points
out
that
in
the
1956
campaign,
the
radio
and
television
stations
made
about
$10
million
on
political
candidates'
broadcast.
and
we
would
think
that
if
you
are
in
a
position
where
you
have
to
choose
between
a
broadcaster
who
knows
that
he
is
assuming
a
risk
and
who
deliberately
assumes
it
and
who
has
(inaudible)
of
protecting
himself,
it
would
be
left
unreasonable
to
impose
liability
on
him
than
it
would
be
to
impose
liability
as
has
been
done
by
the
court
in
this
case
on
the
innocent
bystander,
namely
the
plaintiff.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
we
understand
that
the
stations
have
a
general
form
of
coverage
which
would
cover
their
liability
for
defamation
in
all
situations.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
any
distinction
in
the
policies
between
political
campaign
and
any
other
kind
of
broadcasters.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
they
don't
have
to
take
political
candidates,
that's
all
there
is.
as
i
said
section
315
specifically
says
no
obligation
is
imposed
to
accept
any
broadcast
on
behalf
of
any
political
candidate,
but
if
you
accept
any
then
you
must
give
equal
opportunity
to
all
other
candidates
for
the
same
office.
so
it
is
strictly
matter
of
their
own
decision
whether
they
want
it
or
not.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
i
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
of
attacking
the
commission
but
if
--
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
i
would
like
to
say
with
respect
to
that,
they
--
the
commission
has
somewhat
vacuolated
in
its
ruling
that
whether
--
as
to
whether
a
refusal
to
accept
candidate's
broadcast
is
to
count
against
it
when
the
question
whether
they
are
operating
in
the
public
interest
as
is
said.
there
is
no
question
but
the
section
315
says
they
have
no
obligation.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
i
question
although
that's
not
involved
in
this
case,
whether
the
commission
by
holding
that
the
public
interest
criterion
requires
political
candidate's
broadcast,
has
gone
against
section
315,
which
specifically
holds
that
they
are
not
required
to
carry
such
–-
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
--
there
are
such
rulings.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
your
honor
no
station
has
been
denied
a
renewal
of
a
license
on
that
ground
but
i
think
that
the
commission
has
warned
them
from
time
to
time
if
they
will
consider
that
as
part
of
appraising
their
overall
--
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
there
maybe
unless
that
--
it
was
clarified
in
a
decision
for
example
in
this
court
which
would
state
that
no
obligation
to
carry
political
candidates'
broadcast,
which
is
a
specific
position.
it
cannot
be
used
--
the
opposite
of
that
cannot
be
used
in
terms
of
the
general
criterion
of
the
public
interest,
because
to
that
extent
the
commission
has
whittled
down
the
words
of
section
315
as
to
no
obligation.
ms.
harriet
f.
pilpel
we
believe
that's
so
and
your
honor
also
just
mentioned
something
which
i
think
points
to
another
important
factor
and
that
is
that
we
are
not
a
political
candidate.
and
therefore
if
you
were
to
hold
some
rule
of
non
immunity
or
something
with
reference
to
political
candidate
we
would
still
urge
that
you
hold
with
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
below
then
when
it
comes
to
a
client
like
ours
who
is
an
innocent
third
party,
who
has
no
right
of
reply,
who
under
the
statute
has
no
right
to
equal
opportunity
that
that
person
must
be
given
a
remedy
or
he
is
totally
without
recourse.
thank
you
your
honors.
