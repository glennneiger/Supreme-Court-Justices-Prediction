immunity
under
the
federal
statute
or
immunity
under
the
state
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
ask
you
a
question?
you
very
frankly
say
that
in
your
view
congress
had
nothing
on
this
subject
to
indicate
on
the
immunity
phase
to
give
any
light
one
way
or
the
other,
the
statute
certainly
is
completely
silent
on
it.
where
do
we
go
from
there,
under
your
view,
where
should
we
go?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh
i
didn't
mean
to
anticipate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
know
but
that
doesn't
give
me
at
least
any
help
because
i
am
asking
what
you
think
we
should
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should,
in
the
absence
of
any
light
in
the
congressional
record
as
you
say,
we
should
imply
an
immunity
provision
into
the,
into
the
statute?
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
say
about
a
different
approach
namely
that
if
congress
has
not
indicated
anything
on
the
subject
at
all
as
to
what
the
consequences
would
be,
that
the
consequences
are
left
to
state
law
and
state
law
applies
with
whatever
consequences
are
attached
to
the
federal
prohibition
against
censorship?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
not
very
unusual
thing
under
our
system
or
under
our
court
system?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
premise
for
your
statement
that
you
would
have
a
right
of
censorship
over
obscene
matters?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
broadcaster?
send
it
through
the
mail?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
(inaudible)
if
colorado
law
governs
as
to
your
liability,
what
is
the
state
of
your
law?
would
you
be
libel?
in
north
carolina
i
think
--
north
dakota
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what's
your
law,
your
state
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
would
be
libel,
would
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
section
315
doesn't,
you
would
be
libel?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
case
hardly
presents
the
case
that
you
have,
does
it?
