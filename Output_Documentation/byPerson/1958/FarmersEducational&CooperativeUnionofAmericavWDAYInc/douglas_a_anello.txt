mr.
douglas
a.
anello
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
i
first
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
add
that
is
not
the
position
of
the
national
association
of
broadcasters,
assuming
sir,
assuming
the
constitutionality
for
the
moment
of
section
315,
that
the
broadcaster
may
delete
anything,
including
obscenity.
may
i
also
sir,
clarify
something
that
i
believe
general
greenspan
â€“
general
greenbaum
left
a
little
bit
up
in
the
air,
not
concerned
what
chairman
coy
really
did
say
and
on
page
27
of
our
brief
there
is
a
colloquy
between
mr.
coy
and
mr.
o'hara
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
coy
says
the
commission's
interpretation
of
section
315,
where
it
say
there
shall
be
no
censorship
is
that
there
shall
be
no
censorship.
if
the
stations
in
the
various
states
of
the
country
are
censoring
political
broadcast
for
defamatory
and
libelous
material,
because
under
state
law,
they
believe
that
they
are
libel
for
libel
and
defamation.
the
commission's
position
is
that
the
federal
enactment
of
the
section
315
has
clearly
invaded
the
field
and
that's
the
state's
statute
fall
before
the
federal
enactment.
then
mr.
o'hara,
the
thing
that
i
want
to
know
is
does
section
315
repeals
the
laws
of
the
libel
and
defamation
mr.
coy
our
contention
is
that
it
is
does.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
that
the
station
would
be
put
upon
notice
before
their
license
would
be
withdrawn
and
this
was
done
in
wdsu
several
years
later
when
the
commission
said
from
now
on,
we
will
not
listen
to
any
excuses,
but
that
the
law
to
us
is
clear
and
your
honors
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
what
they
mean
there
sir
is
what
the
question
that
you
directed
to
mr.
bangert
with
respect
to
the
scripts.
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
that
requires
the
submission
of
a
script.
however,
every
decent
broadcaster
would
like
to
see
or
hear
in
advance
what
the
candidate
is
going
to
say,
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter,
hence
he
asked
for
a
script.
he
doesn't
demand
it.
and
he
tries
to
talk
the
candidate
out
of
saying
things
that
might
be
libelous
or
defamatory
or
obscene.
and
i
believe
justice
frankfurter
that
is
what
the
commission
meant
because
certainly
in
wdsu
several
years
later
they
left
no
room
for
doubt
that
they
would
add.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
it
is
sir,
it
is,
but
at
least
it
is
a
form
of
censorship
by
persuasion
and
not
by
mandate
or
fear.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
well,
there
were
two
in
particular
quite
--
well
three,
port
huron
in
the
matter
of
(inaudible)
and
wdsu,
but
sir
as
recently
as
october
1958,
the
commission
in
a
publication
used
the
broadcast
facility
by
candidates
for
public
office,
question
43
may
a
station
delete
material
on
a
broadcast
under
section
315
because
it
believes
the
material
contained
therein
is
or
maybe
libelous,
the
answer,
no.
any
such
action
would
entail
censorship
which
is
expressly
prohibited
by
section
315
of
the
communications
act.
this
is
released
by
the
commission.
this
is
not
just
chairman
coy,
this
is
10
years
later,
11
years
later
the
same
identical
language.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
sir,
this
is
if
you
read
the
questions
and
answers
there
are
some
--
61
and
this
was
adopted
october
1,
1958.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
no.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
i
guess
so.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
since
1948
yes
sir,
continuous
and
non
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
well,
they
said
they
would
take
into
account
whether
or
not
a
station
exercised
a
power
of
censorship
as
i
understand.
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
the
commission
renewed
port
huron,
they
renewed,
wdsu,
they
have,
but
sir
fact
is
this,
that
congress
had
known
of
these
consistent
interpretation
and
i
place
the
opposite
connotation
upon
their
failure
to
act.
if
they
have
acquiesced
in
the
interpretation
by
the
administrative
agency,
the
agency
created
to
carry
out
their
wishes.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
no
sir,
no
more
significant
than
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
known
exactly
what
the
commission
is
doing
what
it
is
holding
and
has
still
failed
to
say
either
way.
they
could
just
as
easily
as
have
said
and
nothing
in
this
statute
shall
immunize
a
radio
station.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
(inaudible)
but
sir
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
i
do
not
sir.
that
would
completely
unconscionable
in
my
opinion.
it
would
violate
all
the
theories
of
fair
play,
justice
or
anything
else
that
we
have
had
in
this
country.
i
know
of
no
such
thing.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
i
believe
sir
that
the
original
radio
act
of
1927
contained
in
it
a
provision.
it
also
had
the
no
censorship
by
the
government
agency
and
it
had
substantially
the
same
as
315
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
it
had
the
no
censorship
by
government,
no
censorship
by
the
licensee.
i
believe
that
it
also
contained
a
provision
that
whoever
shall
utter
any
obscene
or
indecent
remark
over
radio
shall
be
subject
to
a
fine
of
$1,000
or
a
year
in
jail.
i
believe
that,
that
was
in
the
original
1927
act,
i
know
it
was
in
the
1934
communications
act,
but
then
i
believe
in
1948
it
was
deleted
and
removed
to
the
criminal
code.
but
i
say
that
there
again
that
is
not
significant,
because
it
also
says
whoever
shall
utter,
meaning
or
implying
to
me
at
least
that
the
man
may
utter
and
then
suffer
for
his
consequences.
now
here
again,
the
petitioner
has
stated
they
have
no
remedy,
but
they
do
have
a
remedy,
they
have
a
remedy
against
the
speaker.
the
speaker
is
under
no
compulsion
to
speak,
the
station
licensee
is
under
compulsion
to
put
him
on.
i
indicated
earlier
that,
we
had
some
reservation
as
to
the
constitutionality
as
section
315.
they
are
based
upon
two
factors.
one
the
no
censorship
carries
with
it
immunity
and
if
this
isn't
so,
i
then
respectfully
submit
that
315
is
unconstitutional
as
being
a
deprivation
of
due
process,
because
it
imposes
absolute
liability
without
any
control
whatsoever,
and
this
is
a
theory
unique,
it
would
be
alone
in
our
system
of
american
jurisprudence.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
i
believe
the
words
no
censorship
mean
exactly
what
they
say,
no
prior
restraint
of
any
kind.
i
think
near
versus
minnesota
is
still
the
law
at
this
court.
and
i
know
of
no
case,
where
anybody
has
ever
been
enjoined
from
the
publication
of
a
libel.
the
only
infringement
upon
the
first
amendment
in
that
respect,
of
which
--
with
which
i
am
familiar
relate
to
upholding
certain
police
regulations
that
will
permit
punishment
after
publication,
but
even
there
not
prior.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
it
does
not
sir
and
that
brings
us
to
my
second
point.
petitioner
would
equate
us
with
newspapers
insofar
as
they
say
that
newspapers
are
held
libel
without
fault,
but
it
is
one
thing
sir
to
argue
liability
without
fault,
but
quite
another
to
argue
liability
without
control.
newspapers
may
print
what
they
please,
they
may
excise,
they
may
edit.
they
have
no
regulatory
body
to
whom
they
must
account
every
three
years,
nor
any
section
315
telling
them
what
they
may
or
may
not
do.
equality
with
newspapers
operating
under
the
same
conditions
with
the
same
complete
freedom,
responsible
only
to
the
bar
of
public
opinions
is
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
by
every
broadcaster
in
the
united
states
and
maybe
the
time
has
come
when
this
honorable
court
should
take
a
look
at
section
315
from
that
perspective.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
well
sir
i
believe
that
the
constitutionality
of
315
is
raised,
in
that
you
are
asked
to
interpret
315
and
you
might
very
well
choose
to
strike
it
down
as
being
an
infringement
based
upon
the
first
amendment
with
a
right
of
a
broadcasting
station.
this
honorable
court
and
many
others
have
held
that
insofar
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
is
concerned,
both
broadcasters
and
newspapers
are
entitled
to
its
protection.
now
i
wonder
what
would
happen
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
no
sir,
you
have
not,
and
this
might
be
the
opportunity
within
which
you
might
do
it.
mr.
justice
stewart,
may
i
address
myself
to
this.
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen,
if
i
maybe
pardoned
for
asking
you
a
question,
to
a
statute,
that
would
say
that
in
order
to
get
second
class
mailing
privileges,
a
newspaper
would,
if
it
carried
the
speeches
of
one
political
candidate
would
have
to
carry
the
complete
unexpurgated
speeches
of
another
or
of
every
other
political
candidate.
now
under
your
own
doctrine
in
hannegan
versus
esquire,
i
believe
you
stated
that
a
condition
requiring
the
dissemination
of
beliefs,
religious
or
political
would
be
stricken
down
as
unconstitutional.
true
it
was
dicta.
you
did
not
have
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion
in
the
case,
but
that's
language
in
the
case.
i
believe
i
have
the
exact
quote
here,
a
condition
that
certain
economic
or
political
ideas
not
be
disseminated.
we
submit
that
the
reverse
is
equally
true,
we
say
that
if
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
justice
stewart
it
does
not.
the
north
dakota
court
relied
completely
upon
section
315.
it
held
at
section
315
preempted
the
field.
the
federal
government
had
entered
the
field
and
there
was
nothing
for
the
states
to
regulate.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
sir,
i
am
in
complete
agreement
with
that
position.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
no
sir
i
predicate
it,
we
predicate
it
in
our
brief
upon
it
and
our
oral
agreement.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
on
a
state
ground
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
well
the
solicitor
general
raised
that
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
on
the
theory
that
there
was
a
statute
in
north
dakota,
the
lower
court
has
held
unconstitutional.
that
statute
would
have
protected
any
broadcast
station
from
any
libelous
statement
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
made
under
the
compulsion
of
315
or
not.
my
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
as
matter
of
--
yes
sir.
but,
the
court
chose
to
decide
it
upon
a
federal
ground
and
i
believe
that
anderson
versus
brian
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
lower
court
may
have
decided
it
on
a
local
ground,
if
however
it
decided
the
case
on
federal
grounds,
then
it
is
properly
within
the
purview
and
jurisdiction
of
this
honorable
court.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
well
that
might
have
been
mr.
justice
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
it
was
not,
that
is
correct
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
they
held
the
north
dakota
statute
unconstitutional,
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
sir.
31
years,
trying
to
get
the
case
up
here,
we
finally
have
succeeded.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
very
much
so.
but
i
would
like
to
analogize
this
newspaper,
radio
station
position
a
little
more
closely.
let
us
examine
the
situation
in
1927,
when
the
radio
act
was
first
promulgated.
at
that
time
as
you
all
know
there
was
chaos
because
stations
encroaching
upon
each
other,
and
so
the
congress
established
a
federal
radio
commission,
at
that
time
there
were
some
600
stations
on
the
air.
the
congress
enacted
comprehensive
legislation,
because
it
felt
that
is
--
that
the
radio
spectrum
was
limited,
so
the
number
of
stations
would
never
be
too
many,
but
what
do
we
have?
we
have
today
over
4,800
radio
and
television
stations
in
the
united
states.
now
what's
happened
to
newspapers
in
the
same
time?
in
1930
there
were
roughly
1,900
daily
newspapers,
today
there
are
1,800
daily
newspapers.
now
the
argument
has
been
made
that
it
is
competition
that
causes
a
newspaper
to
either
prosper
or
wither.
it
serves
its
readers
and
that
is
why
apart
from
any
first
amendment
you
need
no
regulation,
assumedly
you
might
because
it's
interstate
commerce
if
a
newspaper
sends
editions
in
the
various
states,
you
might
concededly
issue
a
regulation
there,
but
no,
the
first
amendment
protection.
well,
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
radio
stations.
with
4,800
stations
on
the
air,
i
believe
that
competition
will
determine
which
survives,
which
will
program
in
the
public
interest
and
which
don't,
i
am
confident
that
the
american
people
may
make
the
judgment,
that
those
that
do
not
serve
the
public
interest
by
their
programming,
without
regard
to
the
fcc
or
any
other
legislative
or
regulatory
body
will
fall
by
the
wayside.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
i
am
not
sir.
i
am
saying
that
i
believe
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
regulating
newspapers
apart
from
traditional
freedom
of
the
first
amendment
is
that
the
ordinary
competitive
forces
will
force
the
newspaper
to
cater
to
the
public
taste,
because
it
is
said
anybody
can
start
a
newspaper.
that
means
anybody
who
can
buy
a
printing
press,
ergo
if
you
build
a
better
newspaper,
you
will
get
readers,
and
if
you
don't
you
will
lose
readers
and
your
circulation
and
your
advertising
revenue,
but
both
of
us,
both
newspapers
and
radio
stations
live
by
their
advertisers,
which
in
turn
means
that
we
must
have
readers
in
order
to
secure
revenues.
in
summation,
i
would
like
to
say
that
our
position
is
this.
section
315
as
we
view
it,
both
in
the
light
of
congressional
intent,
historic
decisional
law
and
that
law
is
applied
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
prohibits
censorship
by
broadcast
licensees
of
political
candidates
for
the
same
office,
and
this
means
no
prior
restraint.
by
the
same
token
at
the
very
least,
the
principles
of
fairness
and
justice,
administrative
interpretation,
congressional
acquiescence
and
congressional
failure
to
amend
the
law
in
view
of
their
knowledge
of
the
administrative
interpretations
indicate
that
automatic
immunity
must
flow
and
if
such
is
not
the
case,
we
believe
the
section
is
unconstitutional
as
being
violative
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
it
would
take
the
broadcaster's
property
without
due
process,
the
property
which
he
would
be
powerless
to
protect.
thank
you.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
obscenity.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
i
don't
think
so.
i
do
think
that
i
can
play
a
little
mental
gymnastics
and
probably
i
think
justice
stewart
put
his
finger
on
it,
the
hardcore,
there
are
certain
word
that
are
obscene,
and
i
suppose
you
might
argue
that
because
there
is
a
statute
that
specifically
states
that
the
utterance
of
obscene
words
are
punishable.
then
you
might
argue
that
the
congress
when
it
said
no
censorship
was
accepting
that
hardcore
of
obscenity
from
the
term
no
censorship,
but
we
don't
find
that
with
respect
to
libel,
but
i
would
say
that
requires
a
little
mental
gymnastics
on
my
part
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
a
direct
--
that's
right,
because
obscenity
it
is
said
serves
no
useful
purpose.
the
dissemination
of
political
information
is
exceedingly
important
and
what
is
libel?
well,
in
campbell
versus
connecticut
you
said
in
the
realm
of
religious
faith
and
political
beliefs
what's
heresy
to
one
is
faith
to
another.
you
cannot
determine
in
advance
what
is
libelous
in
a
political
speech.
it
will
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction.
it
might
be
libelous
in
maine
or
not
in
texas.
it
depends
upon
where
it
is
and
broadcast
stations
have
no
walls
around
them,
unlike
newspaper.
they
reach
the
four
corners
of
the
united
states.
you
may
censor
or
not
censor,
but
the
damage
is
done,
it's
gone.
mr.
douglas
a.
anello
thank
you.
