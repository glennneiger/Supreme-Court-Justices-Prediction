justice
hugo
l.
black
unconstitutional
as
violating
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say,
it's
your
contention
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
that
way,
a
violation
of
what
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
you
say
that
would
violate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
say
that
congress
could
not
say
to
a
radio
station.
you
must
carry
this
and
at
the
same
time,
exempt
him
from
liability,
if
he
does
carry
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
--
assuming
that
congress
said
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
do
you
read
from
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
mean
that
the
statute,
that
the
radio
stations
and
televisions
stations
are
left
free
to
sensor
things
that
are
said
insofar
as
they
believe
they
are
libelous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
they
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
enjoined
the
newspaper
in
that
state
and
its
law
publishing
that
same
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
statute
is
it
your
are
relying
on
that's
permitting
you
to
eliminate
obscenity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
23,
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
follows
immediately
after
the
senate
which
says
there
shall
be
no
censorship
as
to
the
radio
station,
doesn't
it?
it's
a
part
of
the
same
paragraph
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
passed
originally
by
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
two
provisions
in
there
saying
there
should
be
no
censorship,
one
in
section
19
originally
and
one
in
29.
29
made
it
an
offense
however
for
any
person
to
use
obscenity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
indicate
any
purpose
to
leave
that
up
to
the
radio
station
to
determine
what
was
obscenity?
was
anything
in
report
that
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
either
of
those
two
original
statutes
which
barred
censorship
by
the
radio
station,
been
repealed
in
whole
or
in
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
(inaudible)
quite
a
number
of
opinion
by
the
commission
in
which
they
asserted,
(inaudible)
asserted
that
they
had
--
would
not
censor
for
any
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
you
give
some
weight
to
the
fact
that
congress
in
the
first
act
and
ever
since
has
repeatedly
said
they
could
not
censor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
the
history
of
this
country
where
congress
has
made
it
a
crime
for
somebody
to
do
something
and
then
permit
a
state,
talking
about
state
law,
then
permit
a
statement
to
come
along
and
put
him
in
jail
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
with
reference
to
their
liability
obscenity,
did
the
first
act
also
have
in
a
provision
making
a
violation
of
its
provision
a
crime
punishable
by
both
a
fine
and
up
to
five
years
in
prison?

hugo
