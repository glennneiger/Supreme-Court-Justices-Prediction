to
the
conclusion
that
under

this
station
was
compelled
to
take
--
take
the
script
of
any
candidate
and
suppose
it
was
also
of
the
opinion
that
it
had
absolutely
no
power
to
censor
that
script,
would
it
still
be
you
position
that
the
station
is
libel?
chief

do
you
think
that
the,
that
the

has
the
right
to
demand
of
a

put
up
a
surety
bond
that
it
will
not,
not
injure
anyone
else?
chief

would
be
nothing,
there
would
be
nothing
in

act,
in
any
federal
statute
to
prevent
that?
chief

earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
some
of
the

do
take
out
insurance
against
libel
in
the
political
campaigns?
chief
justice
earl
warren
including
political
campaigns?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
might
have
been
lot
of
difference;
practically
they
don't
have
to

everything,
do
they?
