justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
affidavits
before
judge
daley
when
he
wrote
opinion
on
which
judge
mccarthy
relied?
the
reason
i
ask
you
is
because
i
don't
see
how
you
can
state
answering
justice
stewart's
question
that
exactly
--
in
the
exercise
of
his
or
her
official
function,
that
maybe
the
official
function
and
duties
flowing
from
that
implied
from
the
office
as
against
a
duty
explicitly
imposed
upon
it,
they
are
very
different
things.
but
if
you
tell
me
that
before
judge
daley
who
is
indeed
a
very
careful
judge,
the
affidavits
were
before
him,
i
could
read
what
he
said
differently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
he
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
he
sat
first
in
a
trial
--
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
well
that
makes
it
--
all
right,
then
all
we
have
official
duties
in
the
relation
to
matters
committed
to
him
for
determination.
now
you
say
that
must
mean
explicitly
imposed
on
him,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
were
before
judge
mccarthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
case
that
judge
daley
â€“-
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
you
please
find
out
what
it
is?
that's
a
very
careful
opinion
of
a
very
careful
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
infer,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
that
if
this
ickes
had
done
the
same
thing
as
a
petroleum
administrator
which
i
believe
he
was,
the
--
the
argument
wouldn't
--
do
you
think
the
case
might
gone
differently?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
might
apply
to
a
cabinet
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
might
apply
to
a
generalization
that
you
just
submitted
might
apply
to
a
cabinet
officer.
for
instance,
if
the
--
if
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
make
some
derogatory
or
defamatory
statement
in
relation
to
foreign
relations
of
congressmen,
if
you
will,
or
anything,
having
nothing
to
do
and
not
within
the
wider
scope
of
the
department
of
the
--
of
agriculture.
your
--
your
criteria
which
you've
just
enunciated,
might
apply
to
that
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
affect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
you
--
you
--
to
have
the
cabinet
officer
on
your
argument
as
i
follow
it,
you
have
the
cabinet
officer
moving
within
a
general
circle
as
it
were
of
his
responsibility.
and
if
he
travels
out
of
that
--
outside
of
that
circle,
no
matter
how
generously
drawn
or
broadly
drawn,
then
he
isn't
acting
as
a
cabinet
officer.
is
that
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
that
doesn't
help
us.
that
--
that
restricts
the
scope
of
absolute
immunity
which
you
say
it
should
be
applied
or
have
been
applied
even
to
cabinet
officers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
shed
much
light,
does
it?
on
whether
no
matter
how
strictly
you
draw
the
line
of
--
within
which
a
higher
official
rules
if
he
moves
within
that
--
that
line,
that
circle,
that
area,
he
is
in
a
position
not
unlike
that
but
you
have
it
also
within
his
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
test
of
duty
requires
statutory
command,
some
requirements
by
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
there
is
no
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
no
exquisite
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
it
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
an
observer
of
the
washington
d.c.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
you
say
that
ninth-tenths
of
the
business
of
government
is
done
and
conceived
to
be
done
in
course
of
duty
without
the
statutory
or
any
other
formulated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
a
question
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think,
yes
and
as
far
as
i
know
president
coolidge
is
the
only
man
i
ever
heard
who
said,
when
he
became
governor
that
all
he
had
to
do
--
what
he
did
was
to
read
the
revised
statute
of
massachusetts
to
find
what
his
duties
were
and
that's
all
there
was
to
it.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
have
such
a
conception
of
an
official
duty
in
1959.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
dawson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
latter
half
of
your
argument
namely,
even
assuming
there
is
privilege,
it
is
lost
or
surrendered
or
not
availed
at
all
--
at
all
events,
if
they'll
be
included
in
the
utterance
or
the
printing
of
--
of
statements,
accusations,
defamatory
accusations
that
are
outside
of
the
sphere
of
relevance,
whatever
that
maybe.
i
follow
that
argument.
the
first
part
of
your
argument
that
the
vilas
case
is
restricted
to
cabinet
rank
that
was
a
part
of
your
argument
in
order
to
go
with
you
there,
this
court
would
have
to
reject
miles
and
the
glass
and
the
series
of
other
cases
in
which
the
doctrine
was
not
so
restricted.
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
in
the
miles,
the
miles
case
was
a
lieutenant
commander.
they
are
not
--
what
was
this
man,
he
became
an
admiral
here
or
the
captain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i'm
not
--
well,
i'm
putting
the
latter
part
aside.
that's
a
different
argument,
but
merely
as
to
the
scope
of
the
absolute
privilege
as
to
which
your
argument
is
that
it
is
restricted
to
cabinet
rank,
miles
and
all
the
other
cases
are
against
you
on
that.
we
would
have
to
reject
that
series
of
cases.
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
touch
your
second
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
be
a
different
question.
but
--
but
if
your
first
--
if
your
first
branch,
the
first
branch
of
the
argument
is
correct,
all
we
have
to
do
in
these
cases
is
say
the
member
of
the
cabinet
and
that's
rather
easy
to
determine,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
definitely
not
held
by
judge
coleman
in
the
miles
case,
which
you
rely
on
another
branch.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
banned
bond,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
we'd
have
to
reject
the
point
of
view
on
which
a
decision
rests.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
alleged
date
of
the
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
by
alleged
then,
what's
this
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it
must
have
been
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
a
regulation,
it
must
have
been
the
federal
register.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
may
have
gotten
and
you
not
have
discovered
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suggest
that
judge
coleman
inferred
duty
for
much
more
duty
as
there
are
much
more
duty
as
evidence
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
says
the
very
writing
of
his
entire
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
could
be
filed
as
a
disobedience
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
there's
a
case
that
this
court
has
--
you've
been
through
this
much
more
recently
than
i
have
in
which
the
court's
opinion
spoke
of
the
common
law
of
the
department,
the
common
law
of
the
department.
it
sounds
like
it
seems
to
me
when
opinion
is
their
department,
the
common
law
of
the
department,
which
couldn't
be
found,
formulated
in
any
specific
statute,
regulation,
constitution,
or
any
of
the
former
document
just
like
common
law
decisions
are
not
formulated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
you
put
it
in
another
way?
there
are
two
public
interests
but
they
are
not
(inaudible)
the
interest
of
the,
the
protection
of
an
individual
against
defamation
is
not
merely
the
interest
of
that
individual,
its
society's
interest.
that
of
a
society
in
which
we'd
like
to
live
is
a
society
in
which
the
individual
isn't
told
it's
damaging
(inaudible)
truth
about
it.
that's
a
public
interest.
that's
not
merely
his
interest
because
everybody
maybe
without
both.
but
there's
another
public
interest
and
that's
the
one
you're
working.
so,
you've
got
two
public
interests
but
they
do
not
happen
to
be
parallel.
they
happen
to
be
conflicting.
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
make
a
strike
to
balance
between
those
two
kinds
of
public
interests.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
in
england,
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
(inaudible)
from
familiarity.
i
suppose
in
england
if
a
high
army
officer
would
give
out
or
make
or
give
a
press
statement
it'd
probably
would
not
be
privileged
because
it's
against
the
custom
of
the
country
for
a
press
to
talk
whereas
as
the
last
it
seems
to
be
now
the
custom
of
the
country
for
--
perhaps
to
talk
a
lot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
press
release?
is
that
identical
to
have
it
a
press
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
conference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
every
--
if
every
governmental
employee
shut
his
mouth
off,
we've
have
to
pay
up
instead
of
government
administration,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
under
your
view,
admiral
howard
or
captain
howard
if
he
was,
if
he
sent
the
report
to
a
friend
of
his
who
happened
to
be
a
representative
from
michigan,
we
would
not
--
we
could
not
blame
him
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
that's
the
different
story.
everybody
has
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
