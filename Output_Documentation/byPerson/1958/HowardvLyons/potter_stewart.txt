justice

stewart
mr.
sweeney
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
want
to
be
sure
(inaudible)
the
cases
in
this
court,
all
the
government
officials
are
immune,
absolutely
immune,
have
to
do
with
department
heads,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
officers.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
the
--
now,
the
(inaudible)
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
on
those
--
officials
of
that
type,
of
course,
have
a
great
deal
of
policy
making
power
and
policy
making
duties,
a
very
great
deal
of
discretion,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn't
that
the
basis
on
which
absolute
immunity
was
placed
by
the
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
just
let
me
this
so
that
you'll
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
get
my
thought.
then
i
understood
you
that
--
one
of
the
chief
justice's
questions
to
the
effect
that
what
you're
contending
for
was
this
--
was
this
man's
absolute
duty.
he
didn't
have
any
discretion
to
do
this.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
to
obey
his
superior
officer.
and
therefore,
you
mustn't
hold
them
because
it's
not
his
act,
it's
that
of
his
superior
officer.
well,
that's
just
the
opposite
kind
of
a
situation,
is
it
not,
from
an
official
who
has
a
great
deal
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
discretion?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
mr.
sweeney,
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question
comes
back
to
my
original
difficulty
with
your
argument.
i
honestly
don't
understand
if
you're
--
i
know
you're
arguing
that
this
absolute
immunity
should
exist
because
here
was
a
man
with
a
great
deal
of
discretion
or
are
you
arguing
that
the
immunity
exists
because
here
was
a
man
with
no
discretion
that
he
had
to
--
had
to
do
this?
they
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
possibly,
argue
--
are
you
arguing
both?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
that
to
mean
that
it
was
his
affirmative
duty
to
send
these
reports
to
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
or
simply
that
in
doing
so
he
was
acting
in
the
course
of
his
employment?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
so
construe
that
affidavit
nor
the
facts,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman
before
you
sit
down
i
don't
want
to
pursue
this
further
except
to
me
its
quite
important
because
i
think
this
--
at
least
it
occurs
to
me
maybe
quite
a
different
kind
of
case
from
the
preceding
case,
and
i
gather
that's
your
position,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
should
have
absolute
immunity
because
it
was
his
affirmative
duty
to
do
exactly
what
he
did,
and
that
is
to
send
the
material
to
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
justice
potter
stewart
now
its
true
is
it
not
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
did
not
take
that
view
of
the
facts,
i'm
referring
to
page
39
of
the
record,
where
they
don't
say
it's
the
petitioner's
affirmative
duty
at
all.
i
simply
say
it's
understandable
that
he
might
have
conceived
it
to
be
his
duty
and
we
don't
criticize
him
for
doing
it,
but
that's
a
long
step
from
saying
it
was
his
affirmative
duty
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
on
summary
--
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
there
again
there
may
be
a
latent
ambiguity
there,
there
is
a
difference
between
having
an
affirmative
positive
duty
to
send
this
material
to
congress
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
conclusion
or
the
statement
that
in
sending
it
he
was
acting
generally
in
the
performance
of
his
employment
and
the
course
his
duties.
those
would
be
different
states
of
fact,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
but
it's
sure
is
your
position
that
the
facts
here
show
these
two
affidavits
and
the
findings
of
facts
of
the
district
court
relaying
on
the
affidavits
clearly
indicate
that
in
this
case
it
was
his
affirmative
duty
to
send
these
communications
to
the
congressmen,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
agree
with
me
wouldn't
you,
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
understand
the
facts
to
be
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well
not
explicitly.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
just
before
you
have
and
leave
the
point
you're
on,
you
--
you
said
a
moment
ago.
if
you
said
there's
no
duty
at
all,
now
the
fact
is
that
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
motion
was
supported
by
two
affidavits
which
appear
in
the
record
at
page
20
and
22,
i
guess.
and
that's
all
we
have
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
those
affidavits
alleged
that
there
was
a
duty
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
wasn't
a
duty
and
i
wondered,
what
was
the
support
for
your
statement
that
there
was
no
duty?
justice
potter
stewart
the
support
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
say
that
only
because
it
would
be
very
unlikely
that
that
would
be
his
duty?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
isn't
that
as
i
suggested
yesterday
really
these
--
that
these
two
cases,
the
first
case
that
was
argued
yesterday,
in
district
of
columbia.
you're
suggesting
that
there,
there
should
be
an
absolute
immunity
because
this
is
a
man
who
makes
policies
with
his
decisions
and
gives
orders
and
so
on
because
he's
an
executive,
he's
a
policy
maker,
he
has
an
important
job.
and
now,
in
this
second
case
of
the
first
circuit,
you're
saying
here,
there
should
be
an
absolute
immunity
because
there's
an
unqualified
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
the
discretion.
well
now,
doesn't
that
in
fact
then
include
all
government
employees
because
there
isn't
going
to
be
people
who
give
orders
or
people
who
take
orders,
and
the
first
case,
you
say
he
gives
orders.
he
should
not
be
immune,
second
case,
he
takes
orders
so
he
should
be
immune.
that
covers
everybody,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
do
concede
i
suppose
that
if
admiral
howard
in
the
course
of
making
this
report
to
the
congressional
delegation
for
massachusetts
had
added
fortuitously
and
incidentally
my
next
door
neighbor
here
in
massachusetts
as
a
thief,
that
would
not
have
been
a
proof.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
no
privilege
because,
of
course,
that
would
have
been
no
part
of
his
duty
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
include
that
in
the
report.
that's
your
position.
