justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
this
defense
is
a
good
defense
under
the
laws
of
massachusetts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
defending
on
the
law
of
massachusetts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
it
all
together
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
proceed
it
on
the
basis
that
you
do
not
have
to
consider
the
fact
that
this
was
turned
over
to
howard?
howard
turned
it
over
with
knowledge
and
the
regular
routine
has
to
be
given
to
the
paper
that's
the
--
your
adversaries
--
the
other
position
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
of
appeals
decide
this
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
this
man
to
reports
this
to
the
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
seemed
to
say
--
well
they
seemed
to
have
gone
on
the
basis
of
justice
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference,
so
far
as
you're
concerned
between
the
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
the
court
went
on
the
theory,
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
accept
the
petition
of
howard
rather
than
that
of
schnackenberg?
justice
hugo
l.
black
howard
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
howard
--
you
say
there
was
a
duty
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals
says
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
on
page
39
at
this
first
paragraph,
they
draw
a
distinction
there.
i
don't
know
what
--
what
they
meant.
but
i'm
not
speaking
on
that.
in
this
respect,
the
defendant's
affidavit
conceded
to
the
court
of
his
official
duty,
that
is,
expected
notice
to
the
congress
and
informant
was
made
with
department
policy
(inaudible)
he
sent
copies.
did
the
court
draw
a
distinction
between
the
statement
of
official
duty
and
statement
of
navy
policy,
and
do
you
draw
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
the
basis
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
are
you
reading?
justice
hugo
l.
black
five.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
they
justified
in
drawing
from
that
inclusion
that
howard
was
not
compelled
to
obey
that
policy
of
his
superiors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they'd
be
entitled
to
weight,
wouldn't
it,
if
you
didn't
offer
some
kind
of
counter
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
summary
judgment,
however,
require
you
to
go
behind
that
and
if
affidavits
are
made
refuting
it
or
it
is
--
not
imposed
on
you
and
viewed
it,
to
make
affidavits
of
your
own
under
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood.
i
meant
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
very
purpose
of
the
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
proceeding
was
to
escape
the
burden
of
the
trial
on
nothing
--
where
there
was
nothing
on
the
plaintiff's
side
or
the
defendant's
side
except
bear
allegations
unsupported
by
proof
and
for
which
--
to
prove
which
nothing
can
be
obtained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
because
i
want
to
get
your
answers
on
it.
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
head
of
the
department
to
have
an
absolute
privilege
particularly
in
the
military,
the
naval
--
the
navy
and
the
army,
the
lower
ranking
officers
would
have
at
least
as
much
privilege
because
if
they
do
not
obey
orders
in
effect,
you
can
deduce,
do
not
do
their
duty,
they
can
be
punished.
they
have
no
discretion
about
obeying
orders,
or
performing
their
duties,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
a
--
was
petitioner
howard
an
admiral
or
a
captain?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
in
command
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
his
reported
direct
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
it
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
it
be
irrelevant
if
it
was
in
the
performance
of
the
duty,
they
had
to
perform
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i'm
just
asking
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
was
--
it
was
--
you're
saying
that
would
not
be
within
his
duties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
are
you
making
that
argument
on
the
assumption
that
there
were
some
things
given
in
the
press
release
in
the
other
statement
that
it
was
his
duty
to
give
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
you
treated
the
other
case
statutory
regard
is
the
same
thing
as
a
non-statutory
regard
as
i
understood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
if
you
had
an
act
of
congress
authorizing
it
to
be
done,
you
wouldn't
have
much
trouble,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
are
the
ways?
what
are
the
considerations
that
you
think
should
be
given
weight
in
this
court
implying
the
existence
of
an
authority,
which
is
not
authorized,
assuming
it's
not
authorized
either
by
statute
or
regulation?
what
are
the
reasons,
policy,
or
otherwise
within
your
judgment
would
--
it
should
be
given
weighty
consideration
in
reaching
a
conclusion
by
the
court
as
to
the
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
i
understood
that
argument
yesterday,
but
--
but
then
quite
just
what
i
am
thinking
at
the
moment,
are
there
any
policy
consideration
that
we
have
a
right
to
take
in
considerate
--
in
--
in
--
when
we
consider
reaching
a
conclusion
that
although
that
no
statutory
authority
to
give
out
a
press
release
and
there's
no
regulation
authorizing
giving
out
a
press
release
that
we
should
nevertheless
reach
the
conclusion
in
the
absence
of
any
either
statutory
or
regulations
authority
or
denying
the
authority.
we
should
reach
the
conclusion
that
such
an
authority
exists.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
a
press
release.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
argument
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
to
be
correct
as
i
--
as
i
do,
still
it
might
be
that
the
common
law
department
--
of
the
department
would
run
counter
to
what
that
department
has
authority
to
do.
why?
what
are
the
reasons
that
supports
your
argument
that
public
official
should
have
attributed
to
them
the
power
to
give
out
wide-spread
information
to
the
public
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
their
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
their
argument
is
--
i'm
not
saying
that
the
argument
would
have
charged
you.
we
are
just
--
their
argument
is
that
an
individual
has
a
right
not
to
be
maliciously
or
as
they
use
it
word
wickedly
and
so
forth,
falsify
the
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
their
argument.
now,
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
countervailing
argument?
in
the
first
place,
do
you
think
that
means
that
they
would
have
to
show
what
is
called
legal
manners
or
actual
spike
or
actual
spike
legal
manners
being
inferred
from
the
fact
that
a
statement
that's
wrong
is
made
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
way
of
spying
or
ill
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
should
they
not
be
--
why
should
they
not
hesitate
to
speak
out
freely
about
public
affairs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
affects
them.
i'm
talking
about
so
far
as
the
public
used
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand,
basically,
your
argument
seems
to
be
something
that
you
have
not
got
enough
to,
that
the
policy
of
this
government
is
to
have
a
wide
dissemination
of
knowledge,
of
public
affairs
and
what
officials
do
in
the
public
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
that
forms
a
basis
in
the
court
reaching
the
conclusion
as
to
the
existence
of
authority
where
there's
no
statute
and
no
regulation
that
provides
it?
i
don't
like
the
word
presumption
or
those
things,
but
then
when
you
look
at
it,
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
of
such
powerful
weight
in
bringing
about
good
government
that
people
should
not
be
held
responsible
for
making
public
statements
in
connection
with
a
public
affair
unless
some
law
clearly
prohibits
it.
is
that
the
basis
of
them?
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
that
the
public
interest
in
that
overbalanced
the
--
the
right
of
the
individual
to
maintain
a
private
suit
for
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
the
court
has
to
formulate
or
draw
a
line
if
it
can,
what
is
your
suggestion
as
to
how
it
can
be
drawn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
i
was
trying
to
find
out.
what
is
your
suggestion
as
to
