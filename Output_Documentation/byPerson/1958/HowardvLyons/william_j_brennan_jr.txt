justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
could
you
ever
have
a
successful
motion
for
summary
judgment
if
the
issues
raised
by
the
pleadings
supersede
the
motion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
creating
a
genuine
issue
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
understand
your
argument,
mr.
dawson
is
that
an
issue
of
fact
was
raised
by
the
pleadings.
if
that's
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
and
that
of
itself
is
sufficient
deplete
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
there
wasn't
a
motion
for
rehearing,
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
like
an
issue
with
that.

a
copy
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
affirmative
obligation
to
do
what
the
captain,
and
the
captain
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
just
tell
mr.
justice
clark
that
is
not
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
are
going
to
supply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
there,
mr.
dawson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
probably
be
privileged
why
--
because
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
compliance--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
compliance
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
maybe
regulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
mean,
is
that
to
say
that
the
--
maybe
regulation
which
was
mentioned
to
us
yesterday
did
not
include
the
--
the
sending
of
those
reports
to
the
members
of
congress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
when
you
say
not
privileged,
you
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
outside
the
scope
of
duty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
what
--
i
wish
you
--
i
wish
you
could
help
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
understanding
this
