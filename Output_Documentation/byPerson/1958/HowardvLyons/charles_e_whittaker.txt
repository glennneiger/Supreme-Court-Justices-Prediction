justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
not
quite
correct,
sir.
does
not
the
affidavit
obviously
relies
(inaudible)
there's
a
separate
hearing
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
thinking
of
the
one
in
relation
to
the
company
that
was
sent
to
members
of
congress
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
towards
this
was
--
this
(inaudible)
are
you
referring
to
the
copies
that
went
to
the
massachusetts
delegation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
defendant
who
was
here
as
i
understand
you
now,
he
was
sending
those
copies
by
admiral
howard
through
the
massachusetts
delegation
was
under
the
disposal
of
duty.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
to
be.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
normally,
truth
is
a
defense?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
no
exceptions?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
suppose
they
have
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
maybe
in
some
states
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
were
those
the
claims
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
right.
now,
this
is
why
i
got
the
distinction
you
from
the
court's
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
no
place
of
decision
at
all
unless
it
makes
the
distinction
based
on
admiral
howard's
affidavit
that
he
had
a
legal
duty
to
file
the
reports
with
his
superiors
and
the
judgment
here
it
held
that
those
were
not
exclusive
privilege.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
matter
of
the
copies
that
were
sent
to
the
congressional
delegation,
both
were
made
only
in
the
course
of
official
duties
but
in
accordance
with
navy
policy,
not
any
compulsion.
and
therefore,
judge
magruder
says,
“those
were
only
qualified
the
privilege.”
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
at
least
i
--
i
think
you
--
you
agree
that
under
the
law,
if
there
was
not
a
legal
compulsion
for
or
duty
by
regulation
or
law,
having
a
regulational
order
has
any
effect
to
that,
to
file
these
reports
with
the
congressional
delegation,
there
would
be
no
qualified
privilege.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
mean
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
excuse
me.
may
i
ask,
(inaudible)
that
because
petitioner
was
required
by
(inaudible)
to
make
this
report
in
his
(inaudible)
he
was
not
responsible
for
what
the
(inaudible)
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
except
in
the
case
where
the
person
who
was
trying
to
produce
the
report
has
no
opportunity
but
to
produce
the
report.
now,
is
that
the
case
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
he
have
done
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
other
than
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
as
i
understand,
you're
asking
justice
brennan,
it
is
that
the
conflict
is
sufficient
to
defeat
a
motion
or
judgment
on
the
pleading
would
also
defeat
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
his
publication
of
controversy
or
the
sending
of
literatures
to
members
of
the
massachusetts
delegation
by
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
respondent,
that's
in

record
