would
you
mind
giving
me
the
name
of
that
second
circuit
decision?
justice
john
m.

yes.
thank
you.
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
pleadings,
is
there
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
this
was
in
his
line
of
duty?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
this
came
up
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
a
motion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
summary
judgment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
district
court
treated
the
allegations
and
the
admiral's
affidavit
is
un-denied
and
therefore,
said
there
was
no
issue
of
facts.
is
that
the
way?
justice
john
m.
harlan
moreover,
you
haven't
crossed
petition
here
either.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question
there
just
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
test
the
scope
of
your
position.
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
department
of
labor,
for
example,
the
secretary
of
labor
issued
a
directive
to
all
of
the
employees
all
over
the
country
saying
that
it
is
important
that
the
press
and
the
public
should
be
kept
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
field
units.
and
if
therefore,
they
were
instructed,
every
employee
was
instructed
whenever
he
thought
that
he
had
a
news
item
going
within
the
line
of
the
--
the
activity
of
this
office
to
issue
a
press
statement
in
the
--
your
view
that
would
give
every
employee
of
the
department
a
absolute
privilege,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
suppose
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
every
--
every
member
of
the
department
of
labor
all
over
the
country
with
an
absolute
privilege,
an
absolute
privilege.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
--
as
to
his
sending
the
reports
to
his
superiors,
is
there
a
naval
regulation
as
such
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
assume
so
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
pays
the
judgment
in
these
cases?
does
the
government
come
up
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
government
come
up
and
pay
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
was
wondering
if
you
had
a
case
where
a
man
thought
he
was
doing
the
proper
thing,
his
superior
approved
it
and
then
(inaudible)
he
gets
a
judgment
for
libel
against
him,
have
you
had
any
cases
of
that
kind,
do
you
get
(inaudible)
or
what
happens?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
that
is
matter
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
law
is
the
same
in
this
instance,
well
massachusetts
better
(inaudible).
