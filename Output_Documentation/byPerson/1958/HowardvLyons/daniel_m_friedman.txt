mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
the
immunity
question
relates
not
to
the
dissemination
of
information
to
the
press,
but
to
the
dissemination
of
information
by
a
member
of
the
executive
branch
or
the
legislative
branch.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
admiral
howard,
is
the
commanding
officer
of
the
boston
navy
shipyard.
the
alleged
libel
in
this
case
consisted
of
the
transmission
by
admiral
howard
to
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
of
copies
of
a
report
which
he
sent
to
his
two
superiors
in
the
navy
department
in
washington.
the
report
explains
the
reasons
why
admiral
howard
was
withdrawing
recognition
from
a
veterans
employees
group
that
was
operating
at
the
navy
shipyard.
the
two
respondents
in
this
case
were
two
officials
of
that
organization.
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
he
was,
he
is
now
a
rear
admiral.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
admiral
howard
had
an
absolute
privilege
in
sending
the
report
to
his
two
superior
officials
in
washington
and
both
felt
that
he
did
not
lose
his
privilege
in
transmitting
a
copy
of
the
report
to
his
immediate
military
commander,
the
commanding
officer
of
the
first
naval
district,
even
though
he
knew
that
under
normal
practice
in
that
area
this
report
would
be
made
available
to
the
press.
however,
the
court
held
that
when
admiral
howard
also
sent
a
copy
of
these
--
his
report
to
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation,
he
lost
his
absolute
privilege
and
he
had
only
a
qualified
privilege
with
respect
to
that
publication.
the
association
in
this
case,
the
shipyard
employees
association
had
been
in
1949
recognized
as
an
accredited
employee
representative
at
the
boston
naval
shipyard
and
in
accordance
with
the
accepted
navy
industrial
relations
procedure
the
shipyard
administration
had
met
with
these
groups
and
conducted
various
employee
relationships.
after
a
time
the
administration
of
the
shipyard
concluded
that
the
activities
of
this
association
were
becoming
increasingly
disruptive
of
good
shipyard
administration.
they
found
particularly
objectionable,
a
series
of
newsletters
that
the
association
was
publishing,
was
distributing
to
its
members
and
also
transmitting
to
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
in
fact
after
one
of
these
things
had
been
transmitted
to
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation,
so
an
investigation
conducted
by
the
navy
department
of
the
administration
of
the
shipyard,
and
finally
in
september
1955,
admiral
howard
decided
to
withdraw
recognition
from
this
organization
and
the
alleged
libel
in
this
case
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
8
to
15,
and
that
is
the
report
which
he
submitted
to
his
superiors.
there
are
in
this
--
in
the
record
in
this
case,
two
affidavits
which
have
not
been
contraverted.
the
first
is
an
affidavit
by
admiral
howard
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
22
and
23,
in
which
he
states
that
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties,
he
was
advised
that
the
charges
made
against
the
administration
by
this
organization
had
been
transmitted
to
the
members
of
the
boston
--
of
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
and
he
further
stated
that
the
paragraph
5
of
the
affidavit,
at
page
22
of
the
record
he
stated,
in
the
course
of
my
official
duty
as
commander
of
boston
navy
shipyard
and
in
conformance
with
navy
department
policy
of
keeping
members
of
congress
informed
of
matters
in
which
they
have
an
official
interest,
he
sent
copies
of
his
report
to
all
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
now
admiral
howard's
immediate
military
superior,
admiral
schnakenberg
also
put
an
affidavit
in
this
case,
set
forth
at
pages
20
to
21,
in
paragraph
five
of
that
affidavit
admiral
schnakenberg
stated
that
included
among
admiral
howard's
official
duty
as
commander
of
the
boston
naval
shipyard
was
the
furnishing
of
copies
to
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
of
his
official
notification
to
the
bureau
of
ships,
personal
action
taken
by
him
as
commander
of
the
boston
naval
shipyard.
now
when
admiral
howard
decided
that
he
had
to
withdraw
recognition
from
this
organization
because
of
the
problems
that
was
creating
in
the
shipyard,
clearly
he
was
required
to
report
that
under
navy
regulations
to
his
superiors
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
questions
in
this
case
that
the
transmission
of
this
official
report
gave
him
immunity.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
that
action,
for
the
transmission
to
his
immediate
superiors.
it's
not
questioned
that
in
this
case
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
were
deeply
concerned
with
what
was
going
on
at
the
boston
navy
shipyard
and
the
affidavit
of
admiral
schnakenberg,
not
here
contraverted,
states
that
one
of
the
duties
of
admiral
howard
the
petition
here
was
to
send
copies
of
this
report
to
the
concerned
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
construe
that
to
mean
this
was
his
duty,
in
the
sense
that
it
was
an
obligation,
specific
obligation
on
his
part.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
seems
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
court,
because
they
don't
discuss
the
affidavit
of
admiral
schnakenberg
in
their
opinion.
they
do
discuss
the
defendant
that
is
admiral
howard's
affidavit
saying
keeping
with
navy
department
policy
and
the
course
of
his
official
duties,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
affidavit
of
his
direct
superior
there
was
part
of
his
official
duties,
to
me
means
something
more
than
merely
this
was
one
of
the
things
which
he
had
discretion
to
accomplish.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
there
is
no
specific
order.
there
is
this
general
navy
department
policy
which
the
admiral
was
required
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
he
did
not,
there
is
--
there
had
been
issued
a
policy
directive
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
which
in
rather
general
terms
say
it
was
the
duty
of
all
naval
installations
to
keep
their
local
congressional
delegations
informed
of
what
was
taking
place
with
respect
of
matters
in
this
area.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reaching
this
conclusion
recognized,
as
i
have
indicated
previously
in
my
argument
in
the
thor
case,
that
the
policy
behind
the
granting
of
absolute
immunity,
page
38
of
the
record
in
the
howard
case,
is
not
to
protect
wicked
defendant
from
the
normal
civil
liabilities
for
the
publication
of
defamatory
statements
maliciously
and
in
bad
faith.
rather
the
policy
is
to
further
what
is
deemed
to
be
the
greater
public
interest
in
ensuring
the
consciences
public
official
complete
freedom
in
the
exercise
of
their
duty
without
the
inhibiting
fear
of
possible
(inaudible)
in
which
they
would
have
to
satisfy
a
jury
of
their
own
good
faith,
and
carrying
out
that
policy
the
court
held
that
admiral
howard
had
an
absolute
protection,
not
a
qualified
privilege,
an
absolute
privilege
with
respect
to
sending
of
these
reports
to
his
superior
officers.
we
don't
think
that
a
distinction
can
fairly
be
drawn
in
this
case
between
his
duty
to
send
the
report
to
his
superiors
and
his
duty
to
send
it
to
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
admiral
howard
fortuitously
decided
that
this
was
a
matter
that
might
generally
be
of
interest
to
the
members
of
congress
and
volunteered
to
send
it.
he
stated
and
it
is
not
controverted
that
he
was
aware
that
the
members
of
this
organization
had
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation,
their
charges
against
the
shipyard
and
in
the
circumstances,
it
was
necessary
and
carrying
out
his
duties
in
navy
policy,
that
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
be
kept
informed
of
this
significant
step
being
taken
at
the
naval
shipyard,
that
is
withdrawing
recognition
to
this
group
which
had
been
a
considerable
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
administration.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
a
general
regulation
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
as
a
further
regulation
which
is
that
requiring
the
commander
of
a
shipyard
to
accord
recognition
to
employee
groups.
now
there
was
no
specific
provision
in
the
regulation
for
withdrawing
recognition
from
these
groups
and
therefore
since
there
is
another
regulation
requiring
him
to
advice
but
he
does
not
conform
to
the
general
regulation
to
withdrawal
of
recognition
from
these
groups
would
be
required
to
be
communicated
to
his
superiors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
there
is
a
not
a
copy
of
the
secretary's
orders
in
the
record,
but
i'll
be
glad
to
make
it
available,
furnish
copies
to
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
states
members
of
congress
are
very
anxious
to
keep
in
touch
with
what
is
going
on
in
their
respective
states
and
districts.
navy
agencies
shall
keep
them
advised
if
possible
in
advance
of
any
new
actions
or
curtailment
of
actions
which
may
affect
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
and
that
we
believe
is
supported
by
the
affidavit
of
his
immediate
military
commander
who
says
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
going
to
submit
copies
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
it
was
published
no
february
3,
1955.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
trying
to
check,
it
was
a
very
broad
direction.
i
think
it
was
distribution
list
to
in
effect
all
naval
installations
or
something
like
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
the
specific
provision
says
that
legislative
matters,
when
(inaudible)
with
respect
to
legislative
matters,
those
would
be
handled
through
the
navy
department
in
washington,
but
all
others
maybe
handled
--
shall
be
handled.
and
we
think
this
was
--
here
the
admiral
was
carrying
out
his
duty
of
advising
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
of
what
he
was
proposing
to
do
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
respondent.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice,
in
admiral
howard's
report
he
pointed
out
at
page
12
of
the
record,
just
after
folio
number
14,
he
states,
speaking
of
the
publications
of
this
group,
thereby
design,
they
are
sent
to
members
of
congress
and
furthermore
in
--
he
also
refers
to
page
14
of
his
report
to
the
fact
that
the
chief
of
bureau
of
ships
in
the
navy,
made
an
official
investigation
as
a
result
of
certain
charges
made
by
this
organization
and
finally
in
his
affidavit
admiral
howard
suggests
at
page
22,
paragraph
three,
in
the
course
of
my
official
duties
as
commander
boston
naval
shipyard
i
was
advised
that
a
list
of
charges
against
the
boston
naval
shipyard
management
made
by
the
federal
employees
veterans
association
was
given
to
every
massachusetts
congressman
and
senator.
so
that
in
this
case,
the
organization
involved
itself
had
taken
the
initiative
in
widely
publicizing
these
charges
and
admiral
howard
also
stated
in
his
report
and
in
his
affidavit
that
these
charges
had
not
only
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation,
but
has
been
widely
distributed
to
the
press,
both
of
wire
services
and
the
boston
newspapers,
and
there
has
been
an
investigation
of
some
of
these
charges
by
the
navy
department,
a
report
of
that
investigation
similarly
had
been
transmitted
to
the
congressional
delegation.
in
the
circumstances
we
think
that
admiral
howard
was
doing
no
more
than
his
duty
when
he
made
available
to
the
interested
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
copies
of
his
report
explaining
why
he
was
withdrawing
recognition.
the
rule
--
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
that
admiral
howard
had
only
a
qualified
privilege,
would
have
the
same
deleterious
effect
on
inhibiting
this
high
government
official,
the
performance
of
his
official
duties
as
the
requirement
of
qualified
privilege
in
the
case
of
the
executive
officer.
i
think
it
was
put
very
well
by
judge
woodberry
in
his
dissenting
opinion
when
he
stated,
at
page
41
and
42
of
the
record,
i
would
say
that
congress
can
be
assured
of
receiving
a
free
flow
of
un-watered
down
information
of
the
kind
it
needs
wisely
to
exercise
it's
legislative
supervision
over
the
military
establishment,
only
if
military
officers
like
the
defendant
are
free
from
the
restraints
naturally
flowing
from
the
fear
of
a
lawsuit,
in
which
they
might
or
might
not
succeed
in
convincing
the
trier
of
facts
of
their
good
faith,
and
then
he
said
as
far
as
sanctions
are
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fear
of
military
discipline,
perhaps
at
the
instigation
of
a
member
of
congress
outraged
at
the
liable
of
a
constitution
provides
an
adequate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
individual.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
individual
to
these
cases
pay
the
judgment.
i
mean
it
might
be
possible
for
them
to
seek
readdressed
in
congress
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
of
any
such
cases
i
would
suggest
that
hitherto
the
cases
that
have
gone
to
judgment
have
resulted
in
the
recognition
of
the
absolute
privilege.
there
was
one
case
many
years
ago
involving
a
marshal
who
was
held
responsible
and
i
don't
know
what
happened.
the
united
states
as
such
would
not
been
liable
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
one
further
matter
which
i
like
to
allude
to
briefly
in
connection
in
this
case,
which
was
touched
on
but
no
decided
by
the
court
here
and
that
is
the
question
whether
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
privilege
which
the
government
official
has,
you
look
to
state
or
to
federal
law
to
determine
that
question.
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
necessarily
to
decide
it
because
it
said
that
either
under
federal
or
state
law
there
would
be
only
a
qualified
privilege.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
this
question
is
to
be
decided
by
federal
and
not
by
state
law.
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
suggested
that,
that
was
appropriate
rule
at
page
40
where
it
stated
in
the
absence
of
a
prescription
by
the
congress,
is
it
not
a
function
of
the
federal
courts
to
formulate
the
rules
of
liability
applicable
to
official
actions
by
civilian
or
military
offices
of
the
united
states
regardless
of
what
the
state
courts
might
say.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
law
in
--
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
law
is
the
same
in
both
instances
holding
that
he
did
have
an
absolute
privilege.
we
are
urging
that
he
does
have
an
absolute
privilege
and
we
urge
that,
that
question
is
to
be
decided
by
federal
rather
than
by
state
law.
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
it
because
i
think
the
theory
has
been
set
forth
fully
in
our
brief
and
i
might
just
state
that
hitherto
all
the
cases
which
have
dealt
with
this
question
of
liability
of
government
official,
absolute
immunity
for
defamation
have
assumed,
at
least
sub
silentio
that
it
is
a
question
to
be
decided
by
federal
rather
than
by
state
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
for
one
thing
has
not
--
they
have
not
given
sufficient
weight
to
the
affidavit
of
his
commanding
officer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
finding
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
set
forth
at
page
23
and
they
have
not
been
challenged,
and
the
statement
of
the
district
court
is
the
complaint,
affidavits
and
documents
show
conclusively
that
the
statements
attributed
to
the
defendant
were
published
by
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duty
and
in
the
light
of
matters
committed
to
him
for
determination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
that
would
be
--
if
it
were
the
lighter
situation,
it
would
be
analogous
to
the
previous
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
itself,
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
explicitly,
and
the
court
of
appeals
it
seems
us
overlooked
the
affidavit
of
its
commanding
officer.
it
relied
solely
on
the
affidavit
--
according
to
the
affidavit
of
the
petitioner,
that
he
was
merely
carrying
--
acting
in
conformity
with
may
be
department
policy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
i
don't
believe
it
was
judge
daley
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
it
was
judge
mccarthy
and
judge
mccarthy
quoted
from
an
opinion
of
judge
daley
in
another
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
opinions
were
before
judge
--
evidenced
before
judge
mccarthy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
we
have
--
i
construe
that
to
mean
that,
in
the
light
of
the
affidavit
of
admiral
schnakenberg.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes
i
just
found
in
two
or
three
days
ago,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
brought
to
my
attention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
frankly
to
this
day,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
whether
admiral
howard
was
or
was
not
aware
of
the
regulation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
do
you
want
the
date?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
his
regulation
was
published
in
1955.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
before.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
this
was
not
a
regulation
mr.
justice,
this
was
a
circular
letter
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
possible,
i
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
said
in
rather
general
terms
that
his
duties
included
this.
he
didn't
specify
the
source
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
affidavit
that
he
filed
in
general
terms
spoke
of
his
duties
and
--
and
i'd
like
to
point
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
in
many
areas
in
the
government
where
individuals
have
duty,
that
their
duty
to
perform
and
it
isn't
specifically
spelled
out
in
black
and
white.
i
mean,
i
think
personally
i
have
many
duties
that
are
not
put
down
in
specific
instructions
to
me
yet
they
are
very
definitely
my
duties.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
afraid
i
could
and
i
try
to
avoid
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
if
one
of
my
duties
was
to
make
public
statements,
i
think
i
would
be
required
to
make
those
statements.
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
there
are
two
different
types
of
considerations.
one,
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
man's
duties,
we
have
to
look
to
the
actual
operation
of
his
office,
just
what
he
does.
and
the
policy
reason
it
seems
to
me
is
that
if
you
limited
the
scope
of
the
duties
for
which
he
had
immunity
to
the
particular
things
that
were
spelled
out
then
the
situation
would
be
that
the
government
officials
would
be
very
much
circumscribed.
in
other
words
you
grab
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
basic
policy
is
that
this
is
already
is
necessary
for
the
official,
efficiently
to
carry
out
his
particular
duties
whatever
these
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
again,
we
need
to
make
available
to
members
of
the
public
important
information
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
his
post.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
i
might
mention
here
just
briefly
that
in
this
case,
it
was
denied
under
oath
that
admiral
howard
released
this
to
the
press.
admiral
howard
did
not
release
this
report
to
the
press.
the
report
was
released
to
the
press
by
admiral
howard's
superior
and
he
transmitted
a
copy
of
it
through
a
channel.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
strongly
urge
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the--
the
basic
nature
of
the
--
of
their
function
in
contemporary
society,
the
giving
of
adequate
information
with
respect
to
the
public
business
is
as
a
vital
agent
of
government.
it's
necessary,
both
to
give
the
public
information,
and
also
so
the
public
may
be
adequately
informed
as
to
what
its
government
is
doing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'll
first
say,
i
think
they
would
have
to
show
actual
malice
in
order
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
as
the
policy
argument,
of
course,
we're
not
contending
that
there's
any
public
policy
to
be
served
in
a
particular
case
by
permitting
a
government
official
to
issue
a
defamatory
statement.
our
point
is
that
there's
a
broader
public
interest
involved,
the
broader
public
interest
ensuring
that
government
officials
do
not
hesitate
to
speak
freely,
to
speak
out
when
they
think
it's
necessary
in
the
public
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
of
the
fear
that
if
they
speak
freely
and
if
subsequently
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
--
they
will
hesitate
to
speak
freely
because
of
the
fear
at
some
subsequent
date,
that
they
may
be
forced
to
defend
their
actions
against
charges
of
malice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
and
that
a
particular
--
the
public
will
suffer,
the
public
will
suffer
if
because
of
this
fear
particular
individuals
maybe
reluctant
to
give
out
information
that
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
so
and
i
believe
that
this
suggestion
is
inherent
in
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
which
have
granted
an
absolute
immunity
to
public
official
acts
within
the
broad
scope
of
their
official
duties
and
in
every
one
of
these
cases.
we
must
assume
and
in
testing
the
scope
of
the
report
that
was
done
maliciously
and
as
judge
learned
hand
said
that
it
could
restrict
it
to
the
particular
case
where
it
was
--
the
way
you
were
sure
that
were
was
no
basis
for
that
would
be
fun,
but
this
is
one
of
these
things
if
you
permit
suits,
you
bring
in
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty.
and
the
result
is
that
the
officials
would
be
very
reluctant
in
this
situation.
in
other
words
it's
the
public
interest
in
the
final
analysis
that
would
suffer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
injury
put
it
--
if
i
may
put
it
this
way.
the
injury
to
the
public,
which
would
result
from
permitting
the
maintenance
of
this
suit
outweighs
the
injury
to
the
particular
individual
which
may
result
in
the
particular
case
he
is
not
permitted
to
recover
damage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
because
under
the
responsibilities
in
our
system
of
government,
the
power
to
do
this
is
focused
in
certain
individuals
occupying
certain
posts.
in
other
words,
the
man
who
is
responsible
for
the
basic
program
is
the
one
who
should
have
the
duty
and
the
right
to
inform
the
public.
and
this
guarantees
responsibility
and
that
it
is
not
permitted
to
everyone
down
the
line.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suggest
two
theories.
one,
in
the
case
where
the
officer
is
--
or
the
individual
has
unraised
specific
duty
where
this
is
part
of
his
duties
in
the
sense
that
he
is
obligated
to
perform
it
i
think
at
whatever
level.
he
is
--
he
should
be
protected
in
performing
that
duty.
that's
the
case
of
the
naval
officer
who
made
the
report.
that's
the
case
of
judge
davis
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
which
you
referred
yesterday,
in
which
a
supervisor
of
the
--
of
the
dietetic
room
in
a
veteran's
hospital
made
an
adverse
report
on
the
plaintiff
who
was
a
kitchen
helper
in
connection
with
the
plaintiff's
part.
i
think
when
you're
in
the
area
of
duty
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it's
not
a
press
release.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
a
press
release
in
that
situation
would
be
absolutely
privileged.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
certainly
would,
but
we're
not
suggesting
a
role
which
would
permit
every
government
employee
to
issue
press
releases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
our
suggestion
is
it'd
be
limited
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
to
what
we
might
call
the
policy
executive
level.
now,
as
i
said
yesterday,
it's
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw.
you
can't
necessarily
fix
the
line
and
say
that
all
groups
on
one
side
or
all
groups
on
the
other.
i
think
it
has
to
be
developed
in
a
case
to
case
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
a
sense,
yes,
but
in
a
very
real
sense,
no,
because
well
admiral
howard
we
think
has
a
privilege
for
what
his
duty
is.
we
don't
suggest
that
admiral
howard
if
he
himself
that
could
decide
it,
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
issue
a
press
release
without
any
authority
to
do
so
that
he
would
be
privileged.
i
think
it
--
we're
dealing
with
two
different
things
on
the
one
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
of
course
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
that
would
have
been
a
fortuitous
thing,
having
nothing
to
do
with
his
duty.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
because
he
would
have
to
in
putting
out
his
press
releases,
this
would
have
to
be
again
within
the
scope
of
his
duty.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
to
whatever
extent,
he
is
under
an
affirmative
obligation.
he
is
instructed
to
put
out
a
press
release
and
i
think
he
does
have
absolute
immunity.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
that
the
normal
practice
is
that
the
responsibility
for
determining
what
would
be
in
a
press
release
would
be
at
the
higher
level.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
way
in
which
the
duties
of
the
office
are
carried
out.
if
you
had
a
director
of
public
relations
who
is
given
broad
discretion
to
issue
press
releases,
which
he
deemed
were
necessary,
if
he
were
deemed
to
be
the
policymaking
official
which
i
doubt
then
i
would
think
he
would
have
that.
but
if,
in
fact,
he
is
just
basically
performing,
you
might
say
the
ministerial
function
of
carrying
into
effect
the
policies
formulated
by
higher
authority
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
it's
not,
perhaps
i
inadvertently
used
the
word
ministerial.
what
i
meant
was
that
he
was
not
making
the
basic
policy
determination
in
that
situation
whether
particular
information
should
be
given
out.
i
think
that
what
you
have
in
this
situation
is
the
problem
of
--
a
decision
is
made
to
make
information
available
to
the
public.
that's
made
at
the
executive
level.
now,
then
it's
his
job
of
implementing
that,
determining
the
contact
of
the
particular
press
release.
and
i
think
when
an
individual
in
carrying
out
which
you
might
say
his
day
to
day
work
of
preparing
these
press
releases
that
when
he
does
carry
that
out,
i
think
he
--
he
is
protected
to
that
extent.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
they
make
there
it
depends
from
agency
to
agency
and
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
suppose
from
press
officer
to
press
officer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
again,
it's
--
it's
i
think
it's
the
basic
problem
that
you
have
in
every
government
agency
is
the
staff
assistance
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
which
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
this
court
holds
that
in
the
case
before
us,
the
previous
case
that
mr.
barr
had
immunity,
that
would
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
reach
down
to
the
lower
level.
all
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
hold
here
is
that
an
individual
of
mr.
barr's
rank
who
is
the
top
executive
officer
have
the
privilege
and
that
an
official
of
the
rank
of
captain
--
admiral
howard
who
is
under,
as
we
believe,
the
specific
duty
to
make
copies
of
this
report
available
to
congress,
that
admiral
howard
in
that
situation
has
a
privilege.
and
i
think
that
when
you
deal
with
the
problems
at
the
lower
level,
that's
something
that
will
have
to
be
worked
out
on
a
case
to
case
basis
as
the
law
develop
in
this
area
after
this
court
had
decided
in
spalding
against
vilas.
you
have
this
large
number
of
cases
applying
these
general
principles
to
particular
factual
situations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
he
might
still
have
to
qualify
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
no,
he
did
not
claim
the
privilege
in
that
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
distinguish
him
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
i
may
refer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
so.
i've
--
i've
--
i
would
suggest
it
but
in
the
case
of
mr.
barr,
while
his
agency
was
under
the
economic
stabilization
agency,
it
was
an
independent
agency
which
had
basic
responsibility
in
charge
of
the
rent
control
problem.
i
mean,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
point
out
that
at
the
time
of
the
press
release,
while
it
is
true
that
his
formal
appointment
as
acting
director
had
not
become
effective,
he
was
in
fact
the
acting
head
of
the
agency
by
virtue
of
the
head
of
the
agency
being
out
of
town.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
--
i
think
he
did
to
the
--
because
as
of
that
moment
when
he
issued
the
press
release,
he
was
the
man
who
was
in
the
office
holding
that
office
and
we
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
he
had
been
permanently
assigned
and
if
i
may,
this
one
moment
come
to
the
situation
of
admiral
howard
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
whatever
he
may
deem
to
be
the
scope
of
his
duties,
i
don't
believe
that
it
could
be
fairly
said
he
had
the
responsibility
for
sending
reports
to
congress
just
as
he
saw
fit.
i
think
it's
a
different
situation.
i
think
since
he
was
not
occupying
an
executive
political,
if
you
want,
policy
function,
his
responsibilities
and
powers
are
more
limited
and
he
was
limited
to
that
which
was
his
duty
and
we
think
in
this
case
that
this
has
shown
that
his
duty
was
an
affirmative
one
to
