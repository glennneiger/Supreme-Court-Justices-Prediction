mr.
claude
l.
dawson
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
associate
justices,
in
my
answer
to
that
i
say
this.
there's
a
total
absence
in
the
record
of
any
such
proof
that
he
was
under
compulsion
to
send
this
report
to
the
members
of
congress
or
to
release
it
to
anyone
except
to
the
person
to
whom
the
memorandum
was
directed.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
affidavits
in
this
case
state
that
it
was
his
duty
to
send
this
report
to
the
admiral
in
charge
but
they
cite
no
order.
they
cite
no
regulation
or
anything
that
shows
that
that
is
his
duty
nor
in
the
affidavit
which
is
the
navy
or
--
or
what
he
says
is
the
navy
policy,
to
send
this
to
members
of
congress
of
all
memorandums.
he
cite
no
memorandum
or
order
or
regulation
requiring
them
to
do
that.
so
that
in
both
cases,
the
affidavits
which
are
shown
are
mere
conclusions
of
the
affiance
and
are
not
entitled
to
very
much
weight
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
when
they
considered
them,
gave
them
very
much
weight.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
they'd
be
entitled
to
--
to
a
weight
to
the
extent
that
the
affidavit
show,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
now,
your
honor,
i'll
refer
you
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
in
which
we
alleged
that
outside
of
the
--
of
the
--
in
which
the
respondents
alleged
that
outside
of
the
duties,
that
the
releasing
of
the
memorandum
to
the
members
of
congress
from
massachusetts
and
also
releasing
through
the
admiral
before
a
release
to
the
press
were
outside
of
the
duties
of
it.
now,
the
--
the
only
thing
that
as
far
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
and
i
wasn't
at
the
trial,
at
the
hearing
rather,
is
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
this
case
admits
all
of
the
facts
that
are
well
pleaded.
and
of
course,
considers
the
affidavits
in
the
case.
now,
if
there
is
a
disputed
fact
in
which
they
must
be
under
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
in
this
case,
to
the
effect
as
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
--
he
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
duties,
then
the
finding
that
predicated
only
on
the
affidavits
has
hereto
in
the
record
cannot
be
sustained.
and
i
--
that's
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
all
right,
sir.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
respondents
in
this
court
referred
to
the
petitioner
howard
as
a
rear
admiral
at
the
time
of
the
release
of
the
libelous
memorandum
in
question,
he
was
then
a
captain
in
the
--
employed
in
the
boston
naval
shipyard.
now,
the
respond
--
respondent
lyons,
the
time
that
this
memorandum
was
issued,
was
the
national
commander
of
the
federal
employees
veterans
association
which
has
posts
in
various
government
agencies
from
coast
to
coast.
the
other
respondent,
mr.
mcateer,
was
the
commander
of
the
local
post
of
the
--
in
the
boston
naval
shipyard.
there
have
been
considerable
activities.
the
federal
employees
veterans
association
is
composed
of
members
all
of
whom
have
been
--
have
honorable
discharges
in
the
united
states
army,
navy
or
the
marine
corps
or
the
air
force.
no
one
else
is
eligible
for
membership
in
this
organization
and
the
--
there's
no
question
about
their
loyalty
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
one
of
their
cardinal
principles
that
they
have
a
100%
loyalty
to
the
--
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
now,
at
that
time
that
this
memorandum
was
issued
by
the
petitioner
howard
cancelling
the
recognition
that
have
been
given
to
the
federal
employees
veterans
association
to
represent
members
in
various
grievous
matters
--
grievance
matters
in
the
boston
naval
shipyard.
no
notice
was
ever
given
to
their
respondents
or
to
any
members
of
the
federal
employees
veterans
association
that
he
was
passing
upon
a
question
of
whether
they
were
eligible
to
represent
the
members
in
the
boston
naval
shipyard.
no
order
to
show
cause
why
they
should
--
the
recognition
should
be
canceled,
was
ever
served
upon
the
respondents
or
any
of
the
officials
of
the
feva
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
memorandum.
now,
it
seems
that
in
this
case
the
government
has
taken
a
position
that
in
issuing
the
memorandum
in
question,
that
the
petitioner
howard
was
absolutely
immune
from
--
in
other
words,
he
was
absolutely
privileged
in
issuing
a
memorandum
in
question.
now,
in
that
respect,
there
is
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
in
where
this
--
this
court
and
the
other
courts
have
extended
the
rule
of
absolute
privilege
in
the
matter
of
adjudicating
anything
that
fell
within
the
duties
of
a
public
official.
but
the
rule
is
--
is
very
limited,
and
it
has
generally
been
applied
by
this
court
and
to
--
and
by
other
courts
where
the
party
issuing
the
libelous
memorandum
or
the
libelous
statement
was
either
charged
with
matters
of
policy.
now,
the
petitioner
howard
was
not
in
anyway
charged
with
matters
of
policy.
policy
of
the
navy
department
is
made
and
directed
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy.
he
was
simply
the
ranking
officer
in
charged
out
of
the
boston
naval
shipyard
at
that
time.
now,
his
contention
is,
is
entitled
to
complete
immunity
in
libeling
the
respondents
in
this
action.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
it
is
my
opinion,
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
this
report
had
probably
have
been
made,
gone
to
and
then
not
gone
to
regular
channels
but
have
been
directed
to
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
ships
in
washington,
they
probably
would
have
been
a
privileged
communication.
however,
he
didn't
do
that.
he
released
it
to
the
commander-in-charge
of
that
naval
district,
who
the
affidavit
shows
it
would
be
immediately
released
to
the
press
and
it
was
released
to
all
the
newspapers,
and
the
press
associations
in
the
city
of
boston,
according
to
the
allegations
of
our
complaint.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
not
--
pardon
me?
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
disagree
with
that
--
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
and
that
is
that
where
a
person
knows
that
if
he
releases
a
certain
communication
to
another
party
and
that
he
knows
that
the
other
party
is
immediately
going
to
release
that
to
the
newspapers,
that
he's
just
as
responsible
for
that
action
as
a
man
who
released
it
to
the
newspapers.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
that's
what
judge
magruder
said
in
his
opinion.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor.
and
--
but,
of
course
our
position
is
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
howard
could
have
said
to
his
chief,
“this
is
for
your
information.
please
do
not
release
it
to
the
press.”
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
think
he
could
have
done
that.
now,
i
can't
decide
any
regulations
or
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
or
order
to
that
effect
but
that's
my
own
personal
opinion
that
he
could
have
done
that.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
release
was
made
to
the
members
of
congress
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
apparently
upon
the
theory
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
captain
howard,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
if
it
was
his
absolute
duty
to
do
that
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
which
i
have
some
considerable
doubt.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
he
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
the
record
is
covered
only
by
the
affidavits
passed
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
your
honor.
the
--
it's
on
20
and
21
of
the
record,
paragraph
6,
“included
among
rear
admiral
howard's
official
duties
as
commander
in
boston
naval
shipyard,
he
is
--
and
was
on
september
8th,
1955,
the
sharing
of
the
information
concerning
his
command
be
available
to
the
public.
and
that
to
say
the
information
be
released
to
establish
to
the
--
to
official
channels.
during
my
official
absence
on
leave,
the
then
acting
commandant,
first
naval
district
captain
john
a.
glick,
u.s.
navy
authorized
a
routine
release
through
the
public
information
officer
headquarters,
first
naval
district,
to
the
editors
of
various
newspapers
in
boston,
massachusetts,
copies
the
letters,”
so
and
so
forth.
that
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record
as
far
as
(inaudible)
about
the
release.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
to
the
favor
now
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
no,
the
finding
was
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
the
complaint
in
the
affidavits
and
documents
referred
to,
requirements
for
the
motion
shall
conclusively
be
the
statements
interpreted
to
the
defendant
were
opposed
by
him
and
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties,
and
in
relation,
the
matter
commended
to
him
for
determination.
now,
however,
your
honor,
on
the
--
that
issue
was
never
determined
except
on
the
basis
the
affidavit
file
within.
if
you
look
at
record
on
page
3
of
the
record
in
paragraph
3
of
the
complaint,
you'll
find
that
the
eliminating
part
of
it,
it
says,
“outside
of
his
official
duties
on
the
day
this
memorandum,
exhibit
a
to
release
two
copies
of
said
memorandum
to
the
united
press,
the
associated
press,
the
international
news
service,
all
of
the
daily
papers
in
the
city
of
boston,
and
also
--
and
in
--
and
to
the
members
of
congress.
and
in
so
departing
and
in
so
doing,
departing
from
his
official
duties
and
act
solely
in
a
personal
capacity
and
beyond
his
official
duties.”
now,
that
allegation
and
in
the
--
in
the
complaint
made
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
within
the
line
of
his
official
duties.
and
as
your
honor
well
knows,
and
it
doesn't
need
any
citation
of
authority,
that
if
there
is
any
question
of
fact
involved,
and
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
cannot
be
branded.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
that
is
the
rule
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
it's
possible
and
of
course,
i
was
not
at
the
trial
of
this
case
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
and
i
can't
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
i
think
you
can
--
under
the
rules
as
i
understand
the
rules
in
the
district
court,
you
can
move
for
a
summary
judgment
either
with
or
without
supporting
affidavits.
and
that
is
true,
i
see
no
reason
why
the
--
how
they
can
override
the
positive
and
--
allegations
contained
in
the
complaint
by
affidavits.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
your
honor
maybe
correct
in
that,
but
i've
always
taken
the
view
points
that
if
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
conflict
with
the
affidavits
in
question,
you
do
have
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
(voice
overlap)
court
or
a
jury.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
you
could
--
on
--
on
the
basis
of
--
of
taking
the
deposition
on
the
findings
which
is
a
very
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
that's
the
viewpoint
that
they're
taking,
some
of
the
courts
and
i
know
that's
primarily
a
viewpoint
to
take
in
one
particular
case
i
have
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
the
--
that's
just
my
own
viewpoint.
i
can't
cite
any
authority
at
this
time
because
i
haven't
any
case
to
look
it
up.
i
want
to
go
to
another
angle
in
this
case
which
i
think
specifically
shows
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
could
be
affirmed.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
it
wasn't
argued,
your
honor
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
i
searched
the
record
(inaudible)
apparently
they
had
--
they
just
--
just
didn't
argue
within
the
court
of
appeals.
and
your
honor
said
that
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
if
you
recall
where
the
question
was
whether
or
not
it
was
privilege,
qualified
to
be
privileged,
that
you
permitted
that
question
to
be
argued
here
again
even
though
it
wasn't
referred
too
much
in
our
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
it
was
in
--
i
did
not
write
the
briefs
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
it
was
not
raised
and
that
we
(voice
overlap)
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
as
far
as
i
know
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
oral
argument.
i
wasn't
there,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
what
they
argued.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
now
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
no,
that's
right.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
no,
there
was
like
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
as
far
as
i
know
there
was
no
motion
for
rehearing
filed.
now,
the
thing
that
i
--
i
think
that
we
can
stand
on
in
this
case
is
a
case
that
is
recently
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
is
cited
in
my
brief,
it's
iverson
versus
frandsen,
at
page
4
of
my
brief.
the
--
memorandum
which
the
petitioner
howard
wrote
in
this
case
was
not
absolutely
privileged,
if
at
all
it
was
qualified
to
be
privileged.
and
if
it
was
proper
and
a
report
within
that
issue
without
malice
probably
would
be
protected.
now,
in
this
case,
in
the
tenth
circuit,
which
is
a
recent
case,
the
court
--
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
says
that
there
are
only
a
very
few
cases
where
there
are
absolute
privilege
confined
to
a
very
narrow
appeal
such
as
the
judiciary
and
the
cabinet
members,
people
like
that.
it
--
i
think
to
say
that
a
captain
of
the
navy
would
have
absolute
privilege,
in
my
opinion
would
be
almost
a
judicial
outrage.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
--
no,
they
have
no
discretion.
they
probably
--
they
have
to
perform
their
duties.
but
to
perform
their
duties
in
a
proper
manner
is
another
question,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
what
i
--
i'm
trying
to
say
here
now
--
if
you
just
let
me
go
for
about
five
minutes
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
i'll
try
and
show
a
situation
in
the
end.
in
this
frandsen
case,
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
report
of
a
medical
officer
or
psychiatrist
who
held
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
moron
became
a
part
of
a
public
record,
that
the
report
was
only
qualified
privilege,
not
--
not
absolutely
a
privilege,
and
where
it
was
free
from
malice.
now,
there's
a
distinguishing
line
in
this
case.
whether
the
report
made
by
the
petitioner
howard
was
free
from
malice.
if
he
had
a
qualified
privilege
or
even
if
he
had,
he
loses
his
privilege
according
to
the
authority
cited
in
the
brief.
when
he
--
he
parts
from
his
report
and
make
irrelevant
statements
and
statements
that
have
no
business
whatever
being
in
the
memorandum.
now,
what
we're
complaining
about
is
that
these
loyal
americans,
in
page
12,
i
direct
your
honor's
attention
that
this
was
contained
in
the
memorandum.
they
wondered
why
i'm
asking
what
must
be
considered
sound
since
the
navy
department
condoned
this
existence,
continues
to
permit
a
condition
which
amounts
to
overt
subversion
to
exist,
operate,
and
even
deprive
among
moralities
fall
but
nevertheless
readily
identified
a
group
of
shipyard
employees.
whatever
queries
that
mr.
howard
had
when
he
made
that
statement
which
is
not
only
false
but
is
libelous
per
se
and
is
malicious
because
it
is
libelous
per
se,
he
lost
whatever
privilege
he
had,
that
he
had
only
a
qualified
queries
or
even
he
have
an
absolute
immunity.
the
sixth
circuit
--
i
mean,
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
an
early
case,
in
robertson
versus
jordan,
the
eight
circuit
held
in
a
very
early
case,
339
federal
671,
the
old
first
federal
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
239,
your
honor,
671.
the
plaintiff
was
in
the
service
of
the
indian
bureau
and
the
defendant
was
a
publisher
of
a
national
issue
amongst
newspaper
devoted
to
the
cause
of
national
prohibition.
the
defendant
was
an
employee
of
the
(inaudible).
the
article
complained
was
published
in
--
on
october
13th,
19
--
or
october
13th,
1913.
they
charged
the
plaintiff
directly
with
having
a
record
for
theft,
attempted
blackmail,
and
gross
immorality
in
his
early
life.
now,
the
defendant
suit
for
libel
was
based
upon
a
letter
of
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
interior
insisting
it
was
a
public
record.
the
plaintiff
recovered
a
judgment.
among
other
things,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
to
be
privileged
as
a
public
record,
an
entry
of
writing
or
document
must
be
made
by
a
public
officer
in
the
line
of
his
official
duty,
and
is
not
enough
that
he
happened
to
be
an
official
or
that
it's
lodged
among
the
records
as
a
public
notice.
now,
there
are
number
of
other
cases
cited
in
my
brief
here
that
when
a
public
official
depart
in
a
report
from
the
duty
that
he
had
such
as
the
--
the
petitioner
howard
did
in
this
case,
by
saying
that
these
men
were
subversive,
all
works
subversive,
a
condition
existed,
which
is
a
charge
that
they
practically
were
guilty
of
treason
and
--
and
he
departed
from
--
from
his
facts
--
it
was
a
mere
conclusion
on
his
part
which
should
fall
--
which
should
not
have
been
contained
in
any
report
to
the
navy,
and
he
released
it
not
only
to
the
newspaper
of
the
country
but
he
releases
to
all
the
members
of
congress
from
the
state
of
massachusetts,
and
no
--
and
no
--
for
malicious
libel
could
remain
and
made
against
any
man
would
say
against
these
loyal
men
who
serve
their
country
honorably
during
two
wars
to
say
that
they
were
subversive
against
the
interest
of
their
country
who
they
had
served
as
so
honorable.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
the
only
thing
--
the
thing
is
that
the
--
that
if
there
is,
assuming
that
there
was
immunity
from
prosecution
or
from
a
--
from
a
liable
suit
in
this
case,
the
memorandum
which
the
petitioner
howard
issued
and
the
conclusion
in
that
memorandum
of
the
charge
of
overt
subversion
destroyed
any
right
he
had
of
that
immunity
assuming
that
he
had
it
in
his
other
report.
that's
the
point
in
the
case
and
i
have
several
cases
in
my
brief
citing
to
that
effect.
now,
the
only
thing
that
i
have
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes,
i
am.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes,
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
and
i
think
that
under
that
phases
alone
the
--
whatever
--
there
is
no
question
--
excuse
me,
your
honor
--
there's
no
question
that
under
the
law
of
massachusetts
that
this
--
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct.
there
isn't
any
doubt.
there
can't
be
any
doubt
about
that.
it's
all
the
decision
cited
in
--
in
the
brief
here
exclusively
showed
that
--
that
the
decision
of
--
opinion
written
by
judge
magruder
in
this
case
is
proper
and
correct
and
according
to
the
law
of
massachusetts.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
erie
railroad
company
versus
tompkins,
this
court
held
that
the
law
of
the
civil
action
was
the
law
of
the
state
or
the
cause
of
action
arose
conversing
over
100
years
to
the
present
to
this
court.
now,
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
that
erie
railroad
and
tompkins
case
shouldn't
be
followed
in
this
jurisdiction
--
i
mean
in
this
case.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
libel
case,
that
it
should
be
followed
because
what
constitutes
libel
should
be
measured
by
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction
where
the
libel
occurred.
i'm
just
putting
that
out
to
you,
your
honor,
for
i
believe
that
that
is
the
proper.
i
understand
that
this
court
as
in
several
cases
exempted
certain
actions
such
as
actions
under
the
federal
depositors
of
insurance
law
and
some
other
thing
that
the
federal
law
applies
and
that
the
state
law
does
not
apply.
however,
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
this
character,
i
think
that
the
law
of
the
massachusetts
should
apply.
now,
your
honors,
i
think
if
you
--
give
that
consideration
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
the
--
written
by
one
of
our
most
distinguished
judges
in
the
united
states,
magruder,
justice
magruder,
that
we
will
finally
conclude
that
the
judgment
of
the
--
of
that
court
should
be
sustained.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
i
wanted
to
repeat
what
i
said
in
the
few
moments
i
had
yesterday
that
the
decision
in
the
case
of
glass
v.
ickes
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
was
solely
based
upon
the
rank
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
i
want
to
elaborate
now
the
argument
i
had
before
this
court
in
december.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
think
that's
so,
your
honor.
the
rule
that
had
seemed
to
have
been
laid
down
in
the
spalding
case,
which
was
the
one
of
the
earliest
cases
on
the
question
are
viable,
which
predicated
upon
the
theory
that
the
members
of
the
cabinet
had
policy
making
powers.
whether
you
extend
that
to
a
head
of
the
--
of
the
oil
production
board
such
as
mr.
ickes
was,
is
a
--
is
a
question
which
has
not
been
answered
by
the
courts.
the
point
that
i
want
to
bring
out
today,
in
addition
to
the
argument
i
made
before
this
court
in
december,
is
the
fact
that
while
there
may
be
exceptions
of
that,
while
any
public
official
in
making
a
report
to
his
superior
may
have
a
certain
amount
of
privileges.
when
he
goes
beyond
that
privileges
and
--
and
inserts
irrelevant
matter,
not
material
to
the
report
in
the
case,
then
the
privilege
is
lost.
i
believe
that
to
be
the
decisions
of
practically
all
of
the
courts
in
--
below.
now,
for
instance
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
what's
that?
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
and
i
think
if
that
--
that
rule
has
not
been
adopted
by
this
court,
that
it
should
be
adopted.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
and
then
it
should
be
at
least
a
modification
of
a
--
of
a
rule
running
absolutely
on
immunity
to
members
of
the
cabinet
where
they
depart
and
caught
irrelevant
and
immaterial
and
derogatory
statements
that
stayed
with
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
that's
is
my
argument
and
i
think
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
it
just
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
as
i
think
if
your
honor
will
listen
to
the
authorities,
i'm
sure
you
will,
that
i
have
here
in
mind
that
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
is
far
and
beyond
the
office
of
these
members
of
the
cabinet
that
that
rule
has
been
--
as
i
just
announced
has
been
applied.
for
instance,
on
page
20
of
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case,
they
cite
the
case
of
miles
v
mcgrath,
is
4
f.
supp.
603
which
is
the
decision
by
judge
coleman
of
the
district
of
maryland.
now,
judge
coleman
wrote
his
opinion
in
that
case
in
which
he
report
--
he
held
that
the
report
of
the
superior
in
--
which
included
certain
information,
which
ordinarily
would
be
libelous
was
pertinent
to
the
issue
involved
and
pertinent
to
the
proper
report
issues
that's
been
made.
however,
they
didn't
quote
this
from
his
opinion,
in
which
he
said
that
--
in
which
he
determined
the
immunity
of
the
officer
laid
down
the
following
rule.
are
the
statements
germane
to
the
subject?
and
little
bit
later
on,
i
am
going
to
this
record
and
show
that
whatever
these
--
these
respondents
were
charged
with
was
not
germane
to
the
issue
involved.
judge
coleman
said,
“this
inquiry
is
very
essential
and
absolute
privilege
should
not
be
allowed
to
extend
to
any
irrelevant
statement
performed
under
the
guise
of
official
duty.”
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
there
is
a
very
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
let
me
give
you
an
illustration.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
if
--
if
it
was
in
a
reference
to
his
duty,
but
what
i'm
complaining
about
is
not
correct
facts
in
the
case,
but
while
the
man
volunteers
something
which
is
not
beyond
irrelevant
to
the
--
to
the
--
or
force
that
should've
been
made
in
the
case.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes,
that's
right,
should
not
be
within
his
duty
and
he's
not
privileged.
now,
i
--
i
say
this
that
as
--
as
coleman
said
--
and
that
judge
coleman
said
there
is
a
very
definite
distinction
between
granting
an
absolute
privilege
to
all
government
officials
of
whatever
kind
and
granting
on
those
--
only
to
those
in
the
major
executive
branches
of
the
government.
just
as
i
have
indicated
that
they
might
be
the
head
of
the
--
or
in
the
department.
now,
we
go
to
a
second
case
that
they
cite
in
support
of
their
--
of
their
there.
it's
the
case
of
harwood
v.
mcmurtry,
which
is
cited
also
on
page
20
of
their
brief.
in
that
case,
the
district
court
said
that
when
an
officer
departs
from
official
duty
and
indulges
in
defamatory
statements
wholly
irrelevant
and
foreign
to
his
scope
is
not
entitled
to
protection.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
seriousness
of
affording
such
protection
under
the
cover
of
which
the
officers
of
the
government
under
guise
of
official
duty
may
make
a
false
and
a
malicious
statement
something
and
now
--
subjecting
another
to
scorn
and
ridicule
with
the
ensuing
damages
without
the
injured
party
being
able
to
secure
a
legal
address
cannot
be
doubted.
now,
also,
there
are
a
number
of
decisions.
this
point
was
raised
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
on
page
10
of
the
brief,
a
captain
--
the
report
of
the
petitioner
was
neither
fair
nor
reasonable
and
was
fairly
malicious
being
liable
as
perceived.
now,
what
i
want
to
get
at
in
this
case,
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
government
says
that
this
was
all
his
privilege
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
lost
his
privilege
by
putting
extraneous
remarks
in
the
communication
which
he
released
to
the
public
press
and
which
he
released
to
the
members
of
congress.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
no.
well,
i
think
that
if
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
made
a
fair
reasonable
report
of
the
activity
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
that
it
fell
squarely
within
his
duties,
the
report
that
he
made
would
probably
be
privileged.
but
when
he
departed
from
there
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
because
it
was
made
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
in
the
line
of
official
duty
and
required
by
the
congress
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
duty
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
to
make
the
report.
i
say
that
his
report
to
his
superiors
in
washington,
i
say
he
had
no
duty
at
all
to
release
this
to
the
members
of
congress
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
massachusetts
and
the
--
and
the
so
called
adjoining
states
there
in
massachusetts.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
did
not
see
the
regulation.
it's
not
been
put
in
any
brief
as
i
have
seen
and
it's
the
first
time
i
heard
about
it
was
yesterday
when
mr.
friedman
--
then
it
was
not
argued
before
the
--
the
court
as
far
as
i
know.
it
was
not
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
go
cite
it
and
argue
the
case
in
the
court
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
make
reports.
now,
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
the
releasing
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
as
far
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
as
i
know
there
is
none.
i
--
i
--
and
--
and
didn't
point
it
out
to
me
any
brief
that
they
have
is
that
there
is
a
specific
regulation
on
time.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
that's
true
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
think
they'll
have
to
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
i
want
to
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
if
i
can
get
to
my
--
my
point
here.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
that's
all
you
have,
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
the
force
of
the
statement
is
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
your
honor,
and
this
is
--
i
think
that
any
affidavit
which
says
that
all
personal
matters
have
to
be
submitted
to
members
of
congress
of
massachusetts
is
so
ridiculous
as
to
be
unworthy
of
belief.
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
this
record
at
all
to
the
effect
that
any
member
of
congress
asked
for
these
reports,
or
if
they
want
to
complete
their
--
their
proof
in
that
regard,
they
should
have
had
what
further
proof
in
the
record,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
that
members
of
congress
asked
for
this
specific
report,
but
i'm
not
going
to
argue
on
that
question.
i
am
arguing
on
--
on
the
time
they
cover,
if
i
can
this
portion
of
this
release
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
am
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
am
taking
the
position,
your
honor,
as
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
release
of
these
libelous
articles
or
libelous
memorandum
to
the
members
of
congress
was
not
privileged.
i
am
further
taking
the
position
that
if
you
reach
the
point
that
they
were
privileged
that
whatever
privilege
hey
had
was
lost
by
the
language
in
the
article
itself.
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
in
a
minute
and
show
you
the
language
in
there
that
should
not
have
been
in
that
--
in
--
in
that
article
in
any
event,
in
which
the
authorities,
all
of
them
hold,
lost
the
libel
of
privilege
--
i
mean
the
privilege
of
--
of
absolute
immunity
from
libel.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
let
me
give
you
an
illustration.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
say
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
say
that
whatever
he
said
in
the
article
here,
whatever
the
petitioner
said
in
the
article
was
the
--
was
not
responsive
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
i'll
give
you
the
simple
illustration.
petitioner
is
at
the
time
was
a
captain
in
charge
of
the
naval
shipyard
in
boston,
massachusetts.
supposing
you
had
an
accident
in
the
yard,
somebody
drove
a
truck
there
and
somebody
stepped
out
from
the
corner
and
you
had
a
clear
accident.
and
the
commander
of
the
shipyard
not
only
made
a
report
of
the
accident,
but
in
addition
to
it,
he
said
the
man
was
a
murderer
because
he
had
killed
this
man.
now,
he
had
a
right
to
make
a
report
of
it
but
when
he
went
beyond
that
and
said
and
concluded
that
man
was
a
murderer,
then
--
then
he
lost
whatever
privilege
he
had
and
that
is
exactly
my
position
in
this
case.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
--
as
in
the
appendix,
through
the
petitioner's
brief
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
on
pages
26,
27
and
down
to
35.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
as
--
of
the
record,
of
the
record
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
in
this
case.
now,
that
was
sent
out
as
the
reasons
why
they
would
withdraw
recognition
from
the
federal
employees
veterans
association.
i
direct
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
page
12
of
the
record,
in
paragraph
6
of
this
memorandum
said,
they
wonder
why
a
management
was
supposed
to
be
considered
sound
since
the
navy
department
controlling
this
existence
continued
to
permit
a
condition,
which
amounts
to
overt
subversion
to
exist,
operate,
and
even
deprive
among(inaudible)
but
nevertheless
readily
identify
a
group
of
shipyard
employees.
there
was
no
justification,
no
excuse
at
all
for
charging
these
people
with
--
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
--
for
the
state
of
new
york
said
on
subversion,
it
meant
destroying
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
in
this
case,
they
have
charged
him
and
that
is
actionable
per
se.
it
is
a
good
deal
like
the
case
which
i've
just
illustrated
to
your
honors
whether
the
man
had
an
accident
in
the
yard
and
the
man
--
and
--
and
resulting
in
the
death
of
someone
and
in
addition
to
reporting
of
the
accident.
he
said
that
the
man
was
a
murderer.
and
this
--
this
charge
in
my
mind,
this
charge
in
my
mind
is
greater
than
a
murder
because
it
has
in
the
--
and
the
--
and
says
that
these
people
are
disloyal
to
the
united
states
and
that
they
wanted
to
destroy
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.
now,
let's
see
if
there's
any
justification
for
that.
i'll
just
examine
this
exhibit
that
they
put
up.
now,
on
the
pages
26
and
27
where
the
exhibit
is
set
--
set
forth,
may
i
ask
your
honors,
if
you
will
please,
follow
me
on
this?
the
report
of
what
they
complained
about
that
these
petitioners
or
i
mean
these
respondents,
pages
26
and
27.
there's
something
about
an
--
an
identity
that
the
federal
employees
veterans
association
was
giving
an
identity.
on
page
27,
they
referred
to
the
closing
attempt
to
close
the
ropewalk.
many
employees
of
the
organization
were
employed
in
--
in
this
walk.
pages
27
and
28
complaints
are
made
about
a
refusal
of
annual
leave
after
employees
had
planned
and
paid
for
cottage
rent
during
the
summer
vacation
period.
is
there
anything
subversive
about
any
of
those
three
items?
on
page
28,
and
mind
you,
this
is
all
they
complained
about,
which
he
says
there's
overt
subversion.
on
page
28,
a
complaint
is
made
about
a
failure
to
close
the
shipyard
when
the
summer
heat
reached
the
hundred
mark
and
higher
temperatures
where
the
employees
are
working
and
attention
was
called
of
the
fact
that
the
government
employees
at
(inaudible)
near
there
have
been
released.
is
there
anything
about
subversive
about
that?
page
29
of
this
--
of
this
memorandum
reference
is
made
to
the
restoration
of
some
100
employees
of
the
hingham
naval
ammunition
depot
who
were
restored
with
court
order.
is
there
anything
subversive
about
that?
page
30,
still
on
this
alleged
report,
blue-collar
workers
were
asking
for
a
raise
in
wage.
on
page
31,
the
statement
is
made
about
promotional
policies
where
employees
with
higher
rating
and
better
qualified
were
not
promoted
because
they
were
jews.
is
there
anything
subversive
about
--
to
a
protest
that
employees
who
had
a
higher
rating
and
who
were
better
qualified
were
not
promoted?
all
of
these
things
that
they
complained
about
and
they
set
forth
in
their
exhibit
in
this
case
were
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
ordinary
matters
that
were
raised,
grievances
that
arise
between
management
and
the
laborers.
and
yet,
in
their
press
release
in
this
case,
they
branded
these
respondents
were
the
worst
brands
that
that
could
possibly
be
placed
on
them,
both
of
whom
have
been
honorably
served
not
only
in
alliance,
not
only
served
in
world
war
ii,
but
he
also
was
called
to
a
service
in
the
korean
war.
now,
there
is
another
rule
on
this.
now
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
found
some
cases,
too
late
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
on
them,
the
time
i
located
these
cases.
i
wondered
if
we
might
at
this
time
file
a
printed
supplemental
brief.
there
aren't
very
many
of
them.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
want
to
bring
home
to
this
court
the
privilege
which
has
been
accorded
to
attorneys.
attorneys
have
had
almost
absolute
immunity
in
any
matters
before
the
courts
in
pleadings,
briefs,
comments
of
the
courts
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
but
the
rule
is
the
same,
as
far
as
attorneys
are
concerned
that
the
privilege
maybe
lost
and
have
been
lost
in
a
number
of
cases
for
they
went
outside
of
the
record
and
--
and
charged
things
that
were
not
complement
to
the
record.
now,
in
this
case
i
say
that
the
charging
of
these
men
with
overt
subversion
is
clearly
out
of
the
record
and
not
justified
by
anything
that
happened
at
the
boston
naval
shipyard.
in
the
case
of
an
anonymous
attorney
v.
(inaudible)
and
this
is
a
second
circuit
48
f.2d
571.
this
is
one
of
the
cases
i
have
not
included
in
my
brief.
this
was
a
suit
for
libel
brought
by
the
appellant
against
the
appellees.
the
facts
in
the
case
were
as
follows.
the
appellant
was
attorney
at
law
and
sued
for
damages
allegedly
he
was
liable
for
reasons
that
the
allegation
contained
in
the
complaint
filed
or
set
aside
an
order
of
settlement
and
discontinuous
of
an
action
wherein
he
was
named
as
a
defendant
--
was
discontinuous
was
entered
december
24,
1924
in
a
cause
--
involving
the
appellee
(inaudible).
the
attorney,
bateman
appeared
--
appearing
for
as
an
attorney.
the
basis
of
the
suit
was
to
set
aside
the
discontinuous
as
it
was
it
--
issued
duress.
the
suit
was
compromised
and
discontinued
or
the
litigation
or
the
disposition
of
one's
estate
of
a
william
e.
smith.
it
was
claimed
that
smith
was
induced
for
fraud
and
forced
to
marry
one,
clare
smith
that
he
was
in
impaired
mental
condition
that
he
executed
the
last
will
and
testament
which
was
obtained
by
fraud
and
undue
influence.
and
these
conveyances
and
assignments
were
made
which
were
also
fraudulent
and
the
suit
sought
to
enjoin
them,
defendants
think
therein
named
from
transferring,
conveying,
or
otherwise
disposing
other
property.
the
20th
paragraph
of
the
complaint
read,
that
the
said
settlement,
the
plaintiff
has
obtained
evidence
of
the
said
settlement
which
leads
them
to
believe,
and
she
has
an
information
belief
that
the
death
of
the
said
william
e.
smith
was
brought
about
by
the
defendants
pursuant
to
their
fraudulent
plan
and
--
and
conspiracy
here
and
about
set
forth.
this
case
came
to
the
second
circuit.
the
present
complaint
was
dismissed
on
motion.
first,
testing
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
the
appellees
are
deemed
to
have
conceded
the
truth.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
stated
that
the
allegations
are
libelous
and
(inaudible)
and
unless
they
are
privileged,
they
in
effect
charge
the
plaintiff
with
crimes
that
cancel
our
privilege
in
respect
to
such
statements,
were
all
written
and
made
in
judicial
proceedings
and
pertinent
thereto.
in
england,
they
hold
that
the
immunity
is
much
broader
than
it
is
in
the
american
courts.
the
american
crew
--
crew
is
that
pervasive
loss
--
if
the
libel
is
irrelevant
and
cited
in
a
large
number
of
cases
in
support
thereof
among
them
are
these
two
massachusetts
cases.
now,
the
rule
in
the
massachusetts
in
barnett
versus
loud
226
mass
447,
it
was
held
that
a
statement
in
an
answer
seeking
recruitment
for
rent
of
a
room
that
the
lessor
allowed
a
vile
woman
in
--
to
frequent
his
office
and
therein
gamble
in
office
hours
is
not
privileged,
not
being
pertinent
and
material
to
such
acts
not
interrupted
or
attending
to
the
tenant's
possession
are
not
grounds
for
recruitment
in
an
action
for
rent.
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases
in
which
the
privilege
of
a
--
an
attorney
has
been
lost
by
irrelevant
matters
stated
in
pleadings
or
in
motions
there.
and
i
am
contending
in
this
case
by
including
in
this
release
with
the
fact
that
he's
charge
these
men
with
overt
subversiveness
on
which
it
was
held
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
--
of
new
york.
it
was
held
--
shows
that
that
it
was
--
overthrow
the
united
states
government
by
force
and
violence.
that
case
came
up
in
a
question
of
the
communist
party
of
new
york
brought
an
action
to
set
aside
a
statute
in
that
state
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
the
statute
provided
among
other
things
that
if
that
no
one
is
a
member
of
an
organization
which
was
subversive
could
--
could
have
any
right
to
have
a
teacher's
position
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
that
case
that
the
organization
who
brought
the
action
was
not
subversive,
because
they
did
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
how
much
time
i
have
left,
but
i
would
just
want
to
say
this,
that
i'm
a
little
bit
amazed
that
a
department
of
justice
dedicated
to
liberty,
injustice,
and
the
right
for
all
that
would
come
before
this
court
and
ask
this
court
to
make
a
decision
or
make
a
decision
to
the
effect
that
hundreds
and
even
thousands
that
we
take
--
there'd
be
hundreds
of
captains,
but
there'd
be
others
in
the
army
and
the
air
forces
could
have
the
same
rank
as
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
that
if
you
would
have
absolute
authority
to
say
anything
that
you
wanted
to
about
anyone
else
so
long
as
you
made
it
in
official
report.
your
honors,
that
is
not
the
law
as
i
find
it
that
they
all
--
that
it
has
to
be
pertinent
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
case.
if
your
honors
adopt
such
a
rule
as
that,
what
happens?
are
we
to
go
back
to
the
law
of
the
jungle?
are
we
to
go
back
to
the
old
fashioned
custom
of
doing?
because
red
blooded
men
are
not
going
to
take
these
things
lying
down,
in
my
opinion,
they
are
not
anyway.
now,
the
--
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
by
including
in
there
this
libelous
charge
which
is
libelous
per
se
in
charging
these
men
with
overt
subversiveness
certainly
lost
any
privilege
he
had.
and
i
also
have
the
other
authorities,
which
is
contained
in
my
brief
to
--
to
that
effect
and
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
them
here
because
they
are
in
the
brief.
but
i
would
like
to
submit
this
supplemental
brief.
now
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
it
be
necessary
that
i'd
file
a
--
a
printed
brief
on
that?
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes,
very
well.
thank
you!
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes,
sir,
mr.
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
think
that's
true
because
i
think
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
--
i
also
ask
your
honor
that
you
consider
the
language
of
judge
coleman
on
the
latter
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
i
think
that's
probably
correct,
your
honor.
i
admit
i
--
they
would
be
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
that
--
that
goes
to
the
report
on
whether
it
would
go
to
the
release
to
the
members
of
congress,
i
don't
know.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes,
and
i
am
--
that's
definitely
what
was
held
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
glass
v.
ickes
case
because
i
told
you
--
as
i
told
yesterday,
i
was
a
counsel
for
mr.
glass,
co-counsel
for
mr.
glass
in
that
case.
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
well,
i
rely
on,
of
course,
the
district
court
and
judge
coleman,
a
very
distinguished
judge
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
--
of
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
(voice
overlap)
mr.
claude
l.
dawson
yes,
i
think
maybe,
yes,
very
well
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
