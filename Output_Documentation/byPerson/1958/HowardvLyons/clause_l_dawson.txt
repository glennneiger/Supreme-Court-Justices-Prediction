mr.
clause
l.
dawson
may
it
please
the
court.
first
at
outset
in
this
case,
i
want
to
say
that
the
cases
which
have
granted
absolute
immunity
are
the
cases
of
a
libel,
have
been
limited
to
members
of
the
cabinet
who
have
policy
making
powers.
i
know
of
no
cases,
except
to
the
heads
of
the
departments
where
they
have
been
granted
absolute
immunity
unless
they
had
public
policy
making
power.
a
case
of
that
(inaudible)
was
decided
solely
on
the
question
of
record.
i
know
that,
because
i
was
a
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
and
i
argued
that
case
before
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
immunity
which
was
granted
to
mr.
(inaudible)
in
that
case,
was
based
solely
upon
the
fact
that
the
libel
press
release
which
he
had
issued
in
that
case
was
sent
to
press
under
the
signature
of
secretary
of
the
interior.
that
case
was
argued
before
--
one
of
the
judges
was
judge
truman.
the
comment
of
judge
truman
is
shown
on
page
five
of
my
brief,
in
which
he
holds
and
while
he
concurs
in
the
opinion
sustaining
the
question
of
immunity
from
libel
in
that
case,
he
says
that
he
thinks
that
the
courts
have
gone
too
far
in
granting
immunity
to
public
officials.
i
think
the
courts
have
gone
entirely
too
far.
why
should
any
public
official
be
privileged
to
libel,
any
public,
any
citizen
of
the
united
states?
it
is
true
that
the
officer
who
holds
a
job
position
such
as
secretary
of
interior
or
other
member
of
the
cabinet
should
have
a
certain
amount
of
immunity,
but
when
he
departs
from
that
and
fortuitously,
maliciously,
wickedly
and
issues
a
libel,
he
should
be
responsible
for
to
same
as
any
other
official
of
the
--
or
any
other
person,
american
citizen
of
the
united
states.
now
there
is
point
that
hasn't
been
argued
in
this
--
they
haven't
touched
upon
in
this,
before
this
court,
and
i
want
to
bring
it
to
your
attention,
it
is
covered
in
our
brief,
filed
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
the
statements
contained
in
the
libel
communication
are
domains
to
the
subject
matter.
