chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sweeney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
sweeney,
was
that
a
finding
that
he
did
not
give
it
to
the
press?
i
understood
you
to
--
to
say
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
both
to
the
press
and
to
the
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
admittedly,
he
did
not
put
out
the
--
the
press
publication?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sweeney,
would
you
be
here
if
it
was
not
his
precise
duty
to
release
this
to
the
congress
to
the
admiral
duty
to
do
that
but
hadn't
done
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
have
to
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
have
to
--
let's
just
say
a
positive
duty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
follow
you
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
it
was
not
his
duty
and
he
just
chose
to
--
chose
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
concern.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
he
was
given
such
discretion
specifically
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
really?
then
you
make
no
distinction
between
it
being
his
duty
in
this
case
to
send
it
to
congress
and
--
and
on
the
other
hand,
his
feeling
that
it
might
be
helpful
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i'm
with
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sweeney,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
--
the
foundation
for
--
for
this
exemption
on
the
part
of
the
executives
stemmed
either
from
statute
or
from
a
regulation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
his
--
his
protection
comes
from
the
fact
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he's
responding
to
either
a
statute
or
a
regulation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
any
such
statute
or
regulation
in
this
state
so
far
as
the
admiral
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
regulation
in
there
that
affects
the
admiral
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
doesn't,
there's
no
use
taking
your
time
mr.
sweeney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
thought,
mr.
sweeney,
you've
told
us
earlier
that
if
there'd
never
been
disputed,
but
what
this
was
a
positive
duty
on
the
part
of
the
admiral
to
--
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
send
the
--
this
communication
to
the
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
anything
on
the
record
here
that
shows
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
therefore
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i'm
finished
with
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dawson.
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
mr.
dawson,
would
you
mind
addressing
yourself
to
this
last
point
we've
been
discussing
and
--
and
tell
us
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
tell
us
whether
you
agree
with
mr.
sweeney
that--
that
as
the
record
comes
to
us,
we
must
--
we
must
take
it
as
though
the
admiral
was
acting
under
orders
and--and
was
obliged
to
send
this
communication
to
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
do
you
do
with
this
--
with
this
finding
of
the
court
--
the
trial
court,
“the
complaint
and
the
affidavits
and
documents
referred
to
here
--
therein
filed
in
support
of
this
motion
show
conclusively
that
the
statements
attributed
to
the
defendant
were
published
by
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties
and
in
relations
to
matters
committed
to
him
for
determination”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
dawson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
mr.
dawson,
a
moment
ago,
you
were
speaking
of
issuing
a
report
to
this
kind.
are
you
referring
to
the
publication
of
it
to
others
or
are
you
referring
to
the
writing
of
the
opinion
and
sending
it
through
channels
to
a
higher
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
--
but
before
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dawson,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
you
get
to
the
release
of
congress,
i'd
like
to
get
this
internal
situation
straightened
out
in
my
--
in
my
mind.
now,
do
you
mean
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
a
superior
officer
releasing
this
to
the
--
to
the
press
that
a
subordinate
officer
such
as
captain
lyons
was
in
this
--
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
captain
howard
was
in
this
case,
would
have
no
rights
to
issue
as
a
privileged
communication
to
his
superior
officer,
a
report
that
he
was
obliged
by
duty
to
make?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now
in
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let
me
--
let
me
take
a
break
from
there.
if
that
is
your
answer,
what
does
this
record
show
and
what
are
we
bound
by
so
far
as
his
official
duty
in
connection
with
this
is?
now,
not
in
the
--
just
from
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
there
a
finding
of
some
kind
--
the
court
to
--
on
that
subject,
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
other
this
is
one
on
page
23,
the
second
paragraph
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
you
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
dawson.
is
the
issue
of
whether
these
--
this
report
was
properly
released
to
the
press
before
us
in
this
case
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
had
been
abandoned
at
that
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
write
it
in
the
briefs
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no,
i
mean,
was
it
raised
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
was
not
raised
in
the
oral
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
339?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
again,
you're
speaking
about
the
publication
to
the
world,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
--
not
reporting
to
his
superior
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
governs
us
here,
massachusetts
law
or
federal
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sweeney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand,
mr.
sweeney,
it
is
your
position
in
this
--
in
this
case
that
the
admiral
was
not
operating
under
any
discretionary
authority
when
he
did
that.
but
that
this
record
show,
and
we're
bound
by
it,
to
consider
that
he
was
doing
this
as
a
positive
duty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
required
by
his
superior.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sweeney,
i
--
i'm
still
confused
because
i
thought
the
--
you
said
that
the
opening
of
your
argument
this
morning
that
you
wanted
this
case
decided
on
a
very
narrow
issue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
basis
that
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
his
positive
duty
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
do
this,
and
that
he
was
not
exercising
a
discretion
when
he
did
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you've
cited
the
vilas
case
to
show
that
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
and
as
long
as
it's
somewhere
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
to
put
out
statements
of
this
kind
that
he
does
have
a
positive
immunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
make
--
you
make
it
clear
to
this
extent,
but
do
you
think
we
ought
to
reach
the
vilas
question,
but
do
you
urge
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
but
let
me
put
it
this
way.
in
the
event
that
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
your
major
issue,
and
we
must
reach
the
vilas
issue,
does
the
government
urge
that
under
those
circumstances,
this
man
would
have
had
an
absolute
privilege?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
urge
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
i
didn't
understand
--
chief
justice

warren
number
57,
w.
e.
howard,
jr.,
petitioner,
v.
kenneth

and
joseph
s.
mcateer.
you
may
proceed
mr.
freedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
admiral
was
a
captain
at
that
time
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
that
action.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
was
that
directed
to
mr.
--
who
was
that
directed
to?

dawson.

w.

howard,

versus
kenneth
t.
lyons
and
joseph
s.
mcateer.
mr.
dawson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
and
counsel
may
respond
--
may
respond
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
them
if
he
wishes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
the
system
memorandum
of
authorities,
i
think
that
you
could,
you
may
file
it
typewritten.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
when
did
this
regulation
that
you
say
require
--
required
this
man
to
communicate
these
views
to
the
congress?
when
did
that
come
to
light
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
rely
heavily
on
--
on
it
to
--
to
the
effect
that
this
man
thought
it
was
his
duty.
if
that'd
had
never
developed
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
your
briefs
in
this
court
or
at
the
time
of
the
first
argument
of
this
court
and
never
until
couple
of
days
ago,
how
can
you
rely
on
that
very
heavily
as
--
as
being
a
part
of
his
duties
that
he
was
performing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
making
public
statements
against
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
mr.
friedman,
if
you
--
if
you
base
it
on
that
--
on
that
broad
principle,
how
can
you
limit
it
to
any
particular
class
of
public
employees?
why
hasn't
every
public
employee
the
right
to
inform
--
inform
the
public
about
his
particular
work
and
his
particular
function
in
government
and
why
wouldn't
he
have
every
public
employee
have
the
same
right
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
interest
of
the
general
public
to
--
to
have
an
absolute
privilege
to
say
anything
he
wanted
about
anybody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
had?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask
you
this?
in
the
--
in
the
federal
government
alone,
there
are
thousands
of
publicity
agents
and
public
relations
men
or
whatever
you
call
them,
whose
specific
duty,
it
is
to
give
out
press
releases
and
to
inform
the
public
about
what
is
going
on
in
--
in
their
departments.
do
you
suggest
that
everyone
of
those
men
has
an
absolute
immunity
to
say
anything
he
wants
about
any
american
citizen
or
anybody
who's
employed
in
the
united
states
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
we'll
--
we'll
assume
that
it
falls
in
--
as
in
this
case
within
the
realm
of
housing
or
if
it's
in
defense
so
that
department
that
falls
within
some
category
of
defense
still
does
he
have
the
right
to
vilify
anyone
that
he
wants
to
with
impunity
just
because
somebody
has
said
you're
a
public
relations
man,
it's
your
duty
to
put
out
press
releases.
does
that
give
him
an
immunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
your
answer
to
it,
it
would
be
yes.
every
--
every
publicity
man
in
the
federal
government
would
have
an
absolute
immunity
to
say
anything
he
wants
about
anybody
as
long
as
it
fell
somewhere
within
the
--
the
realm
of
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
department.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
can't
be
just
a
ministerial
act
if
he
is
formulating
the
press
--
the
press
releases
himself
and
determining
what
shall
go
into
them
about
individuals,
can
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
it's
true
in
every
situation
that
there
is
no
--
that
there
is
no
--
the
discretion
given
to
public
relations
men
to
--
to
formulate
press
releases
and
the
contents
of
the
releases
they're
making?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
of
course,
you
can.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
they
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all
i
--
all
i'm
trying
to
do
mr.
friedman
is
try
--
try
to
find
out
in
my
mind
how
we
can
do
what
you
argue
doing
and
still
limit
so
that
it
won't
--
it
won't
be
open
to
everybody
to
--
to
defame
the
--
the
reputation
of
citizens
with
impunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
you
--
how
would
you
--
in
that
situation,
how
would
you
distinguish
him
from
your
prior
case
with
mr.
barr?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barr
was
--
was
a
deputy
in
the
housing
administration
and
that
was
under
another
agency
and
he
wasn't
even
--
he
wasn't
even
holding
the
position
of
acting
--
acting
director,
yet
he
took
this
action.
how
would
you
just
--
how
can
you
distinguish
him
between
a
man
who
is
the
commandant
of
a
navy
yard
and
who
does
have
some
sort
of
--
of
responsibility
to
inform
the
public
unquestionably?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
a
lower
actual
arm?
is
he
a
--
is
he
less
of
--
of
a
policymaking
person
than
--
than
mr.
barr
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
being
out
of
town
but
he
wasn't
--
he
didn't
hold
the
policymaking
position,
did
he?
