this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
draws
out
of
an
action
for
libel
brought
by
two
civilian
employees
of
the
boston
navy
yard
against
admiral
howard,
the
commander
of
that
yard.
the
alleged
ground
of
libel,
the
report
issued
by
admiral
howard
and
transmitted
to
his
superior,
copies
of
which
he
also
furnished
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
delegation.
the
district
court
entered
judgment
for
the
petitioner
on
the
ground
that
the
pleadings
and
affidavits
conclusively
established
the
statements
attributed
to
petitioner
were
published
by
him
on
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties
and
in
relations
to
matters
committed
to
him
for
determination.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
part
as
to
the
communication
to
his
superiors
but
held
that
the
communication
to
the
--
or
the
publication
to
the
members
of
the
congressional
delegation
of
massachusetts
was
at
the
best
qualifiedly
privileged
and
remanded
the
case
before
the
proceedings
in
accordance
with
its
opinion.
this
court
has
now
granted
certiorari.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
and
they
are
comprised
the
pleadings
and
two
affidavits
filed
in
support
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
respondents
here,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court,
lyons
and
mcateer,
were
civilian
employees
of
the
boston
navy
yard.
they
were
also
officers
of
an
organization
known
as
the
federal
employees
veterans
association
with
purpose
was
to
bring
together
an
association
of
veterans
employed
by
the
federal
government
to
protect
all
veterans'
rights
which
are
conferred
by
various
laws
and
regulations,
and
also
to
seek
to
better
the
affairs
and
the
rights
of
veterans
employed
by
the
federal
government.
now,
the
navy
has
an
industrial
relations
policy
which
applies
particularly
on
navy
yards
in
which
there's
an
encouragement
of
representative
groups
forming
and
dealing
with
the
--
the
management
of
the
stations.
i
believe
in
massachusetts
at
the
boston
navy
yard,
there
were
probably
30
some
odd
organizations
represented.
they
would
represent
labor
unions,
veteran's
organizations
and
different
groups
who
are
in
a
position
to
speak
for
and
represent
the
employees.
in
1949,
the
feva,
this
federal
employees
veterans
association,
was
recognized
as
a
bargaining
unit.
it
originated
in
this
post
number
1,
was
an
association
of
the
employees
at
the
boston
navy
yard.
that
recognition
continued
for
a
number
of
years,
but
there's
no
question
but
that
the
feva
was
extremely
militant
in
undertaking
to
protect
the
rights
of
its
members.
it
represented
them
at
grievance
hearings.
it
was
instrumental
in
certain
litigation,
some
of
which
was
successful
and
bettered
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
association.
the
feva
also
put
out
a
week
--
a
monthly
newsletter,
which
was
distributed
among
its
members
which
were
given
to
members
of
the
congressional
delegation
of
massachusetts
and
released
to
the
press.
over
a
period
of
time,
these
newsletters
yet,
became
extremely
critical
of
management,
the
navy
yard
management.
they
went
further.
they
criticized
the
policy
of
the
navy
department
as
such,
the
executive
department
as
such.
it
appeared
about
the
beginning
of
1955,
that
certain
complaints
they
had
made
at
the
massachusetts
delegation
resulted
in
an
investigation
as
to
the
personnel
policies
and
other
matters
being
pursued
at
the
boston
navy
yard.
at
the
conclusion
of
that,
the
investigation,
it
was
decided
and
determined
that
no
violations
had
occurred.
shortly
thereafter,
the
petitioner
here,
admiral
howard
became
commandant
of
the
station
and
he
immediately
began
to
encounter
difficulties
with
the
representatives
of
feva.
now,
these
matters
are
set
forth
in
this
report
which
was
sent
to
the
bureau
of
ships
and
the
bureau
of
industrial
relations.
and
he
comments
in
that,
that
the
--
that
with
all
other
organizations
they
found
them
were
beneficial
and
helpful,
that
the
tendency
of
this
organization
was
to
magnify
trivialities,
to
belittle
management
and
you
could
only
conclude
that
their
whole
purpose
was
to
attack
managements,
to
complain,
to
keep
things
in
the
turmoil.
and
as
they
characterized
it,
the
thing
was
openly
subversive
as
to
the
management
of
the
station.
i
think
that
the
words
which
are
relied
upon
as
probably
being
potentially
libelous
in
this,
but
if
they
are
obviously
referred
to
management.
they
also
said
that
it
was
bad
on
the
morale,
both
of
the
management
itself
and
of
other
employees.
as
a
result
thereof,
he
decided
to
withdraw
recognition
of
this
union
as
a
bargaining
unit.
as
i
said
before,
copies
of
this
report
were
sent
to
the
--
through
the
commandant
of
the
first
naval
district
to
the
bureau
of
ships
and
bureau
of
industrial
relation
of
the
navy
department.
he
also
sent
copies
of
the
report
to
all
members
of
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation.
the
commandant
of
the
first
naval
district,
admiral
schnackenberg,
through
the
public
information
office
of
that
district,
released
copies
of
this
to
the
press.
this
occurred
on
september
9,
1955.
a
year
later,
presumably,
just
before
the
local
statute
of
limitations
in
this
suit
was
instituted.
now,
it
may
have
the
usual
allegations
of
libel
that
it
was
malicious,
false,
for
the
purpose
of
--
that
the
defendant
there,
petitioner
here,
departed
entirely
from
his
duty
and
unusually
used
it
as
a
subterfuge
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
this
malicious
attack
upon
the
two
plaintiffs
who
are
officers
of
the
feva,
one
of
whom
was
identified
by
name
in
the
report,
and
the
other
by
description.
an
answer
was
filed
in
which
it
was
sort
of
one
count
of
the
answer
and
denial
in
the
manner
in
form
because,
while
this
report
was
attached
to
the
complaint
it
did
not
have
the
exhibit,
so
that
went
with
this.
also,
as
a
defense,
it
was
alleged
that
the
statements
were
true,
that
they
were
in
the
performance
of
his
duty.
and
finally,
there
was
a
complaint
that
they
were
absolutely
privileged
because
they
were
matters
upon
which
he
acted
in
the
performance
of
his
duty.
before
any
evidence
was
taken,
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
was
filed,
and
two
affidavits
were
submitted
in
support
thereof.
one
affidavit
by
admiral
schnackenberg,
the
commandant
of
the
first
naval
district,
recited
that
he
was
admiral
howard's
superior.
and
on
the
date
this
was
issued
to
admiral
howard
was
in
the
exercise
of
his
functions
and
duties
as
commander
of
the
boston
navy
yard.
that
among
his
duties
was
to
notify
the
bureau
of
ships
and
the
office
of
industrial
relations
of
the
navy
department
of
any
significant
changes
and
personnel
policy
that
took
place.
and
that
this
was
the
title,
a
report
which
should
be
made.
he
also
stated
that
one
of
admiral
howard's
duties
was
to
keep
the
boston
--
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
advised
of
any
significant
personnel
changes
such
as
this.
he
said
that
the
release
to
the
press
had
been
effectuated
by
his
office.
admiral
howard
also
submitted
an
affidavit
in
which
he
said
that
he
had
performed
these
acts
in
accordance
with
his
duties,
that
his
first
duty
was
to
make
these
reports
or
a
report
of
any
significant
personation
of
chain
such
as
this
was
to
the
bureau
of
ships
and
the
bureau
of
industrial
relations.
and
that
it
was
also
one
of
his
duties
to
send
copies
of
that
to
the
massachusetts
delegation.
he
denied
that
he
had
made
any
release
to
the
newspaper.
this
affidavit
was
uncontroverted,
and
as
i
noted
before
in
my
statement
that
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
the
pleadings
in
the
affidavits
showed
conclusively
that
the
statements
attributed
to
admiral
howard
were
published
by
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties
and
in
relations
committed
to
him
for
determination.
it
--
and
the
judgment
for
the
defendant,
dismissed
the
complaint.
on
appeal
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
don't
think
he
dealt
with
the
question
as
to
whether
that
it
was
given
to
the
press
because
he
would
have
held,
i
think,
that
they
had
admiral
howard
giving
it
to
the
press.
it
probably
would
have
been
in
relation
to
his
duties
because
admiral
schnackenberg
did
testify
that
it
was
part
of
admiral
howard's
duties
to
give
these
to
the
press.
however,
the
undisputed
evidence,
both
from
admiral
schnackenberg
and
admiral
howard
is
that
the
release
was
by
admiral
schnackenberg
and
by
not
admiral
howard.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
no.
i
admittedly,
admiral
howard
published,
sent
these
letters
to
the
congressional
delegation.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
that
it's
uncontroverted.
there's
only
two
statements
are
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
one
by
the
man
that
said,
“i
did
it,”
and
the
other
by
admiral
howard
who
said,
“i
didn't
do
it,”
and
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
the
district
court
did
not
bother
to
make
that
finding.
the
court
of
appeals
did
discuss
it
some.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
there
were
three
publications
alleged
in
the
light
of
the
complaint.
first,
the
publication
of
sending
the
report
to
its
superior
officers,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
on
the
basis
of
the
overwhelming
rate
of
precedence
and
authorities
that
that
was
an
absolutely
privileged
communication
and
that
they
would
not
look
behind
that
for
any
element
of
malice.
as
far
as
the
release
to
the
press
was
concerned,
they
stated
that
that
apparently
had
been
abandoned
on
appeal,
which
i
think
was
correct.
however,
they
went
beyond
that
and
said,
“even
if
that
had
not
been
abandoned,
the
evidence
here
clearly
shows
that
if
there
had
been
any
--
the
publication
rather
had
been
by
admiral
schnackenberg.
and
that
while
admiral
howard
may
have
known
that
when
he
put
this
in
channels,
it
would
go
through
admiral
schnackenberg's
office
and
be
released.
nevertheless,
that
was
an
action
over
which
he
had
no
control
with
the
release
of
that
matter
was
one
of
which
provided
for
by
navy
regulations
that
admiral
howard
was
under
a
duty
to
make
this
report.
and
when
he
made
it
and
put
it
in
channels,
he
was
not
responsible
and
could
not
be
held
for
a
publication
even
though
he
might
have
anticipated
that
would
be
what
would
happen
when
he
put
it
in
channels.
on
the
question
of
release
to
the
publications
to
the
congressmen,
i'm
a
little
bit
unable
to
follow
the
theory
of
the
court
except
that
they
said
that
they
did
not
believe
that
the
doctrine
of
absolute
liability
should
be
expanded.
they
did
not
dispute
the
evidence
that
this
was
an
action
performed
by
admiral
howard
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
duty.
it
was
a
duty
imposed
upon
him
by
--
i
assume,
by
regulations
and
by
orders
of
his
superiors.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
i
think
there
are
two
affidavits
if
your
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
just
a
minute,
if
your
honor
please.
the
--
i'm
--
i'm
reading
now
if
your
honor
please,
on
the
affidavit
of
admiral
schnackenberg,
admiral
howard's
immediate
superior.
it's
on
page
21
of
the
record.
“included
among
where
admiral
howard's
official
duties
as
commander
of
boston
navy
shipyard,
is
and
was
on
september
8,
1955,
the
furnishing
of
copies
to
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
of
his
official
notification
of
the
bureau
of
ships
of
personnel
action
taken
by
him
as
commander
of
boston
naval
shipyard.”
now,
that
was
admiral
howard's
superior
and
he
said
that
was
one
of
admiral
howard's
official
duties,
to
furnish
this.
i
think
here's
an
affidavit
is
much
more
significant
than
would
be
admiral
howard's
affidavit,
which
might
sometimes
be
regarded
as
self-serving.
admiral
schnackenberg
was
the
man
in
immediate
charge
of
admiral
howard
and
undoubtedly
knew
what
his
duties
were.
now,
it
is
not
disputed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
by
anyone
else,
that
this
was
not
part
of
his
official
duties.
had
there
been
any
doubt
on
this
question,
undoubtedly,
they
would
have
remanded
the
case
for
further
evidence
or
for
a
more
specific
finding
on
that
question.
it
was
accepted
in
the
case
that
this
was
one
of
his
duties
imposed
upon
admiral
howard
by
the
navy
department.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
delegation,
yes,
your
honor,
because
that's
the
only
thing
--
that's
the
only
point
on
which
the
court
below
held
that
there
was
not
absolute
privilege.
they
held
at
the
best
that
was
a
qualified
privilege.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
--
i
have
never
heard
it
disputed.
it
was
not
disputed
in
the
court
below
and
i
would
make
this
observation,
if
i
might,
your
honor.
had
the
court
entertained
any
doubt
about
that
point,
that
it
was
not
one
of
his
official
duties,
undoubtedly,
they
would
have
remanded
it
for
further
evidence
on
that
--
that
point
because
this
was
up
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
had
been
granted.
and
if
there
had
been
some
doubt,
they
would
have
discussed
that
point
in
their
opinion.
they
accepted
it.
it's
also
accepted
in
--
that
a
--
that
--
the
pattern
in
the
case
it
seems
to
me
indicates
that
the
court
below
rather
definitely
accepted
these
findings.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
briefly
to
advert
to
the
--
in
a
defamation
action,
what
elements
to
argue,
considered
simply,
can
now
the
ground
here.
in
the
defamation
action
between
private
parties,
truth
is
a
defense,
but
if
the
falsity
has
been
established,
malice
is
presumed.
and
so,
the
burden
is
upon
the
defendant
in
a
case
where
if
he
has
not
been
able
to
establish
the
truth
of
these
defamatory
statements,
also,
to
bear
an
over,
almost
overwhelming
burden
to
offset
malice.
in
qualified
privilege,
again,
truth
is
normally
a
defense,
but
the
burden
shifts
and
is
necessary
in
the
place
of
qualified
privilege
for
the
plaintiff
to
establish
malice
either
by
extrinsic
evidence
or
by
evidence,
intrinsically,
that
the
statement
is
so
far
so
recklessly
made
with
malice,
may
be
drawn
by
the
jury.
both
the
--
the
question
of
malice
and
both
these
instances
are
questions
from
the
jury.
in
a
situation
of
absolute
privilege,
the
only
question
that's
for
examination
by
the
court
is
whether
the
person
is
an
official
and
has
acted
in
the
course
of
his
duties
or
a
matter
as
this
court
has
stated
in
spalding
versus
vilas
that
has
more
or
less
relation
to
those
duties.
now,
absolute
privilege,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
exists
in
three
fields.
in
the
legislative
field,
it
exists
by
reason
of
a
constitutional
provision.
in
the
judicial
field
and
then
the
executive
field,
i
think
that
the
cases
are
sufficiently
old
that
you
would
call
them
a
--
a
common
law
almost
in
that
state,
because
as
far
as
the
judiciary
is
concerned,
they
date
back
to
the
days
of
lord
cook.
it
has
also
been
extended
by
the
judiciary
--
by
a
judicial
decision
to
the
executive
departments.
now,
the
reasoning
at
the
back
of
this
is,
not
that
anybody
should
protect
a
“be
known”
person,
a
malicious
person
or
anything
of
that
character,
but
that
because
of
the
--
a
position
that
people
have.
the
decisions
they
have
to
make,
that
they
should
be
able
to
make
those
decisions,
to
utter
those
statements
and
to
do
the
things
that
are
necessary
to
carry
out
their
duty,
without
feeling
that
they
can
be
called
to
an
account
by
any
private
individual
who
feels
that
they
have
been
outraged
or
hurt
or
who
alleges
that
they
have
by
these
actions.
that
it's
been
remarked
in
the
field
of
judicial
and
of
the
immunity
of
the
judiciary,
that
cases
are
so
bitterly
contested
that
the
losing
person
usually
believes
that
the
only
way
the
decision
against
him
can
be
explained
is
because
of
corruption
on
the
part
of
the
judge.
at
least
in
a
lot
of
cases,
so
that
they
were
open
to
them,
they
would
consistently
bring
suit
against
judges
in
the
lower
courts.
now,
in
the
judicial
field,
the
absolute
immunity,
the
extent
is
not
only
their
actions,
of
judges
in
their
judicial
capacity,
but
as
this
court
held
in
bradley
versus
fisher,
that
it's
necessary
that
they
had
--
have
--
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
have
the
jurisdiction
to
perform
the
particular
act
that
they
did,
but
only
that
they
have
jurisdiction,
generally,
in
that
field.
it
extends
to
petty
and
grand
jurors.
it
extends
to
statements
made
by
counsel
before
in
a
judicial
proceeding
and
also
the
testimonies
of
witnesses.
there's
a
complete
immunity
in
all
judicial
proceedings.
now,
this
court
has
only
passed
on
three
occasions
upon
the
absolute
immunity
insofar
as
the
executive
branch
is
concerned.
the
leading
case,
of
course,
is
spalding
versus
vilas,
a
case
in
which
mr.
justice
harlan
spoke
for
the
unanimous
court
in
1895.
that
case
involved
a
--
an
action
against
the
postmaster
general
for
a
--
for
effect
--
would
in
effect
be
defamation.
he
had
sent
out
certain
letters
which
they
claimed
had
bad
effect.
and
then
this
court
reviewed
all
the
judicial
--
all
the
decisions
involving
the
absolute
immunity
of
the
judiciary.
that
drew
from
them
what
was
considered
by
it,
to
be
the
underlying
principle,
and
that
is,
that
public
interest
was
the
controlling
--
the
matter
of
here.
and
that
public
officials,
as
well
as
the
judiciary
had
to
be
able
to
act
freely
without
feeling
that
they
would
have
to
be
called
for
it
to
account
on
suits
by
private
individuals
for
their
acts.
that,
not
only,
of
course,
it's
been
pointed
out
in
many
of
these
decisions,
that
other
matters
are
open
for
this
discipline.
presumably,
a
cabinet
officer
that
transcends
his
functions,
it's
something
that
was
corrupt
or
evil
could
be
removed
by
the
president,
could
be
impeached.
lesser
officials,
of
course,
they're
even
more
subject.
they're
subject
to
the
definite
discipline
of
the
department.
now,
the
test
of
these
cases
as
the
cases
have
evolved,
and
that
there
are
a
very
large
number
of
them
in
the
lower
district
courts.
the
courts
of
appeals
and
then
the
district
courts
themselves,
are
that
--
it
must
--
it's
a
not
--
that
it's
--
it's
either
in
the
course
of
the
performance
of
their
duties
or
for
an
officer
to
have
discretion
either
to
act
or
not
to
act
where
it
has
more
or
less
relation
to
their
duties.
it
must
not
be
an
act
that's
imposed
on
him
by
law.
it's
enough
that
it's
an
act
that
he
can
exercise
by
his
discretion.
now,
as
your
honors,
we'll
proceed
in
this
case
as
much
an
hour
because
here,
the
duty
of
sending
these
reports
to
members
of
congress
was
placed
upon
admiral
howard
by
the
navy
department.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
advert
to
one
fact
here
in
our
--
i
just
checked
our
index.
in
10
of
these
cases
involving
absolute
immunity,
certiorari
has
been
denied.
i
know
that
there
at
least
10
or
15
more
of
them
where
it's
been
denied.
i
know
that
that
ordinarily
does
not
indicate
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
this
court,
but
i
do
submit
that
this
case
as
you
can
steadily
have
been
counting
that
this
court
since
the
decision
in
spalding
versus
vilas,
and
that
the
decisions
have
been
uniformly
denied
with
one
exception.
and
that
was
the
case
of
--
that
came
up,
yaselli
versus
goff
came
up
from
the
second
circuit,
it
involved
an
action
for
malicious
prosecution
against
the
special
assistant
to
the
attorney
general.
these
are
very
acts
in
opinion
by
the
second
circuit
in
12
f.2d.
it
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
which
they
relied
upon
only
two
cases
that
was
bradley
versus
fisher
and
alzua
versus
johnson,
both
cases
hearing
the
immunity
of
the
judicial.
the
other
thing
assigned
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
support
in
this
court
was
the
court's
recent
decision
in
the
last
term,
in
barr
versus
matteo,
where
this
court
vacated
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
sent
the
matter
back
for
a
decision
as
the
court
could
do
so
on
the
question
of
qualified
privilege.
in
that
case,
however,
there
had
been
a
complete
record
made.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yaselli.
y-e
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
s-e-l-l-i
versus
goff
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
12
f.2d
396.
they
also,
if
your
honor
please,
had
drew
very
largely
upon
the
learning
to
be
acquired
from
the
cases
involving
immunity
of
the
judicial
department.
now,
ordinarily,
qualified
privilege
does
not
give
to
the
official
the
type
of
protection
that
would
be
needed
if
he
has
to
perform
his
duties
fearlessly.
in
the
first
place,
presumably
in
a
lot
of
these
instances,
you
will
have
overstated
these
facts,
there
may
be
a
misstatement.
as
i
said,
normally,
truth
is
a
defense.
i
think
there's
one
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
pardon?
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
there's
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
i
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
there's
a
statute
in
massachusetts
that
if
you
have
malice,
truth
is
no
defense.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
there
were
in
some
states
peculiarities
but
--
that's
why
i
say
normally
and
there's
also
certain
other
states
which
have
something
very
similar
to
this
which
constitutes
an
invasion
of
the
privacy.
and
if
you
run
into
one
of
those
things,
they've
are
supposedly
assimilated
the
defamation
that
i
use
the
term
“normally”
to
take
care
of
those
situations.
it's
not
a
universal
rule,
but
it
--
it
does
normally
apply.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
civil
suits
for
libel.
i
think
a
number
of
these
things
--
i
hadn't
looked
into
that
field,
if
your
honor
please,
to
any
great
extent.
i
know
there
are
states
that
make
it
criminal
to
invade
somebody's
privacy.
in
other
words,
the
result
may
also
be
a
civil
relief
but
they're
--
they're
also
made
criminal.
i
did
notice
one
thing
and
that
is
in
france,
any
body
that
disturbs
a
person's
privacy
after
10
years,
it's
a
criminal
offense
there.
10
years
is
supposed
to
be
the
statute
limitations
on
a
person's
reputation.
i
don't
know
of
any
community
in
this
country
that
has
that
particular
law.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i've
noticed
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
no,
i
think
this
is
definitely,
should
be
a
federal
question,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
did,
your
honor,
but
i
know
--
as
the
court
below
could
find
nothing
in
massachusetts'
law
to
show
that
it's
any
different
from
laws
of
other
states.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
i
agree
with
the
court
below
that
the
navy
department
has
an
involved
system
governing
press
releases.
their
policy
basically
is
that
the
public
should
be
informed
involving
matter
that
comes
through
them
unless
it
involves
security
matters
or
there
are
some
other
specific
reasons
for
not
making
it
public.
they
have
instructions
issued.
there's
an
information
officer
in
every
desk
whose
business
it
is
to
look
over
matters
coming
through,
and
if
he
thinks
they're
of
interest
to
the
public
to
release
the
matters.
this
is
a
matter
of
navy
policy.
now,
admiral
howard,
if
you
honor
the
duty,
to
make
this
report,
would
have
to
send
this
report
through
their
commandant
of
the
first
naval
district
and
if
it's
navy's
policy
to
make
these
things
public,
there's
nothing
he
could
do
to
stop
it.
the
point
is
he
had
determined
that
he
was
--
as
a
change
in
personnel,
he
was
withdrawing
recognition
from
feva.
and
that
was
a
matter
that
he
felt
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
report
to
his
superiors.
admiral
schnackenberg
took
that
same
position.
now,
but
when
necessary
for
him
to
report
that
to
his
superiors,
that
maybe
decided
to
intercept
it
along
the
way
and
make
it
public,
there's
nothing
he
could
do
about
it.
he
could
not
refuse
to
make
the
report.
that's
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
and
i
think
that's
the
reasoning
that
applies
to
this
case.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
now,
i
would
have
said
that
it
had
more
or
less
relation
to
his
duties.
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
still
be
here.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
there's
two
--
there's
two
things
on
this.
it's
either,
first,
if
it's
his
absolute
duty,
i
do
not
think
in
those
instances
it's
really
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
his
actions.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
a
positive
duty.
all
right.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that
is
in
response
and
the
directions
of
his
superiors.
and
then
in
fact
it's
his
superiors'
act
when
he
does
something
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
like
that.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
now
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
so
that
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
then,
i
think
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
i
think
it's
a
question
you'd
have
to
find
out
if
that
had
more
or
less
relation
to
his
duty.
in
other
words,
had
there
been
enough
dealings
with
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
delegation
to
indicate
that
this
was
a
desirable
and
good
thing
to
do.
he
might
make
an
error
of
judgment,
but
nevertheless,
if
he
thought
that
because
of
the
relationship
that
existed
between
the
navy,
the
navy
yard
and
the
members
of
congress,
it
was
a
desirable
thing
to
do,
that
is,
i
would
say
that's
something
that
falls
within
his
discretion.
that
would
be
my
argument
in
that
case.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
it
would
be
more
or
less
of
an
incident
to
a
person
running
a
--
running
a
large
naval
installation
in
which
i'm
sure
the
congressional
delegation
of
massachusetts
had
a
very
great
interest.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
oh,
i
do
make
a
distinction,
your
honor.
i
think
the
second
is
a
case
where
you're
--
it's
possible
to
say
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
his
acting
pursuant
to
a
positive
order.
he
had
no
discretion.
it
was
his
duty
to
do
it,
and
his
act
is
the
act
of
his
superiors.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
and
so
that
this
case,
to
my
mind,
is
a
very
simple
case.
it
does
not
offer
some
of
these
more
difficult
facets
that
i
think
would
exist
in
other
fields.
and
now,
there's
just
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on.
that
is
a
--
as
i
say
the
case
law
has
extended
this
to
officials
of
various
types.
it
does
not
depend
upon
the
office
they
hold.
it
depends
upon
the
type
of
the
duty
they
are
performing
that
is
one
that's
been
placed
upon
them
by
law
or
by
orders
of
their
superiors
or
if
they
have
a
discretion
to
act
in
a
certain
field,
that's
the
public
policy
as
believed
to
be
served
by
them
exercising
unfettered
discretion
in
acting
within
the
discretionary
field
that
they
have.
there's
a
--
a
large
number
of
cases
and
as
i
say,
they've
been
consistently
held
that
they're
not
reviewable
by
the
court.
now,
if
i
could
come
back
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
to
what
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
there's
just
the
one
case
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
spalding
versus
vilas.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
and
we've
dealt
with
that.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that
was
in
court
of
appeals.
we
rely
a
lot
on
those
cases,
if
your
honor.
and
we
always
--
they
are
certiorari-denied
cases.
(inaudible)
there's
a
number
of
those
cases.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
it
depends
upon
the
degree
of
discretion
of
what
they're
doing.
as
i
understand,
if
i
could
just
deal
with
another
phase
of
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
right.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
yes.
but
ordinarily
they
only
deal
with
the
discretionary
situation.
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
it
was
a
man's
absolute
duty
to
do
something
that
has
been
before
the
courts
insofar
as,
certainly,
not
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
ordinarily,
any
official
that
performs
an
act
is
either
guilty
of
a
trespass
or
may
commit
a
tort
upon
a
private
individual.
if
he
were
a
private
individual
that
would
be
actionable.
his
defense,
ordinarily,
is
that
he
is
acting
pursuant
either
to
a
valid
law
or
valid
regulation
of
his
superior.
when
he
shows
that,
he
normally
is
immune
from
any
kind
of
a
tort
or
a
trespass
action.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
you
practically
never
find
anything
of
this
character
because
ordinarily,
there's
a
number
of
cases
that
upheld,
the
ainsworth
--
de
arnaud
versus
ainsworth
is
the
next,
in
lynn
o'connor
case
in
the
--
in
the
lower
courts
where
they
have
held
that
because
of
the
complexities
of
the
modern
departments,
it's
impossible
for
the
head
to
exercise
most
of
his
duties.
he
has
to
delegate
them
to
his
subordinates.
but
the
acts
of
his
subordinates
are
usually
the
acts
of
the
department.
now,
that
basically
is
the
reasoning
which
deals
with
the
problem
that
you
raised,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
has
been
restricted
in
this
court
or
the
only
case
they
have
dealt
with
was
the
head
of
the
department.
i
would
assume
that
an
ordinary
assistant
secretary
has
more
people
under
him
and
more
duties
now
than
the
head
of
the
department
had
in
1895.
there's
been
that
much
increase
in
the
complexity
of
government
operations.
and
i
think
the
reason
in
back
of
it
is
the
thing
that
should
be
of
interest.
and,
that
is,
that
you
look
not
at
the
titular
job
that
the
person
holds
but
the
duties
that
they
are
intended
to
perform.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
decision
should
be
made
as
to
whether
there
should
be
absolute
immunity
or
not.
now,
of
course,
again
on
the
question
of
defamation,
we
all
know
that
anybody
that
publishes
it
or
transmits
it
is
liable.
for
example,
when
a
man
has
a
publicity
agent,
public,
whether
he
release
these
things
through,
that
man
is
also
guilty
of
publishing
but
no
one
ever
treat
that
as
anything
except
the
acts
of
the
head
of
the
department
and
the
person
that
directed
him
to.
even
a
newsboy
that
carries
and
sells
newspaper
that
contains
a
libelous
article
is
technically
guilty
of
a
publication.
no
one
bothers
with
that.
you
usually
look
at
the
responsible
person.
but
there's
a
lot
of
technicalities
in
this
field
that
i
think
that
can
be
over
exaggerated.
i
would
like
to
express
the
fact
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
field
of
absolute
privilege
is
concerned,
we
think
it
should
be
examined
--
it
should
be
dealt
with
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
it
has
to
do
with
what
as
a
matter
of
federal
interest
and
the
desire
is
the
balancing
of
two
equities.
the
right
of
a
private
individual
to
be
secure
in
their
reputation,
that's
as
far
as
the
defamation
case
is
concerned,
but
to
this,
of
course,
would
extend
to
the
malicious
prosecution
cases,
false
imprisonment.
there's
a
great
number
of
those
in
the
books
as
an
addition
to
this
particular
form.
and
that
the
relationship,
that
balance
that
should
be
made
as
far
as
federal
officials
is
concerned,
as
far
as
the
federal
judiciary
is
concerned,
is
a
matter
that
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
federal
law
and
not
from
the
varying
concepts
of
48
different
states.
the
second
thing
is,
especially
in
anything
that
has
to
do
with
defamation,
it
should
have
a
uniform
rule
because
a
press
release
from
washington
will
be
published
perhaps
in
all
48
states
of
the
union.
and,
of
course,
you
may
maintain
a
suit
for
defamation
any
place
that
it's
published.
so,
you
would
get
divergent
views
and
divergent
results.
and
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
one
fact
that
i
think
is
quite
disturbing.
i
would
see
no
reason
or
any
basis
on
which
you
can
distinguish,
that
is
on
the
basic
reasons.
the
degree
of
it
might
be
entirely
different
between
the
immunity
of
the
judiciary
and
the
immunity
of
the
executive.
it's
all
based
on
a
basis
of
public
policy.
now,
if
you
applied
state
law
to
the
executive
branch,
i
would
think
by
the
same
sign
and
token,
you
would
have
to
apply
state
law
to
the
judiciary.
and
yet
there's
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
which
is
then
cited
in
the
opinion
below
where
they
held
that
the
judge
can
send
a
copy
of
his
opinion
to
west
publishing
company
under
the
new
york
law
journal
that
transcended
the
duties
of
his
office
and
he
was
guilty
of
publication
of
that
and
it
could
be
held
in
an
action,
at
least
it
was
not
ordinarily
demurrable.
now,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
idea
to
have
the
federal
judiciary
subjected
to
suits
for
defamation
if
there
happened
to
be
some
statement
in
one
of
the
opinion
and
it
was
a
frivolous
argument
put
in
by
an
attorney
and
that
it
would
have
been
published
in
the
new
york
law
journal.
and
that
would
be
--
that
--
i'm
giving
that
as
a
concrete
example
of
what
could
happen.
in
other
words,
i
think
in
the
field
of
absolute
immunity,
it
should
be
definitely
governed
by
federal
law
and
whether
--
whether
different
considerations
apply
to
qualified
privilege,
we
do
not
need
to
consider
because
this
case
is
here
only
on
the
question
of
absolute
immunity.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
no,
not
the
basis
for
exemption.
no,
your
honor.
i
said
that
the
person
was
ordinarily
protected
in
their
action
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
if
it
would
a
constitute
trespass
or
a
tort.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that's
right.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes
there's
a
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
i
would
--
i
would
add
one
thing
like
that
when
i
say
statute
or
regulation
or
a
valid
order
of
his
superiors.i
think
that's
in
that.
i
have
not
examined
the
regulations
to
any
degree.
i
know
there
is
a
--
a
very
definite
regulation.
i
look
at
that
with
more
care
relating
to
the
organization
--
the
industrial
relations
branch
of
the
navy
and
that
provides
that
they
shall
make
reports
on
periodic
reports
through
the
head
of
the
department
in
that
thing.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
release
of
reports
to
the
congressional
delegation.
now,
this
--
this
large
volume
here,
which
i've
been
totally
unable
to
--
i
think
you
can
get
an
idea.
this
has
to
do
with
the
public
relations
of
the
navy.
i
think
it's
(inaudible)
200
or
300
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
there
is
a
--
there's
one
small
one
in
here.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
read
on
this
much
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
don't
think
there's
significant
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
on
it.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
now,
they
sort
of
sides
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
think
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
think
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
my
idea
is
that
they
overlooked
the
basic
situation
here
that
there
was
a
duty
on
his
part,
so
they
don't
challenge
it.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
they
don't
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
they
don't
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
they
don't
get
on
it's
stand
on
that,
but
they
are
--
they
had
--
and
they
said
perhaps,
i'm
reading
from
page
38,
“whether
the
courts
may
perhaps
have
gone
too
far
down
the
line
in
developing
this
doctrine
of
absolute
immunity,
may
be
a
fair
question.
at
any
rate,
we
shall
not
be
astute
to
develop
further
the
categories
of
absolute
immunity.”
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
don't
think
they
did
because,
as
you
said,
if
you
read
on,
it
is
true,
the
sent
copies,
the
previous
members
did
have
an
official
interest
in
being
kept
advised
of
important
developments.
it
is
therefore
understandable
and
certainly
not
abtitious
officious
that
the
commander
of
the
boston
navy
yard
might
have
considered
this
to
be
a
proper
exercise
of
his
official
function
to
see
to
it
that
the
members
of
congress
should
receive
copies
of
such.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
here
is
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
here
is
what
i
think
is
their
--
the
rationale
of
their
decision
in
all
of
its
line.
it
would
be
on
a
wholesome
thing
to
extend
to
this
situation
the
protection
of
an
absolute
immunity
such
has
been
held
to
apply
to
official
reports
to
a
superior
officer.
they
just
don't
like
the
doctrine.
i
think
that's
what
they're
telling
us.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
don't
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
there's
two
--
two
points
on
this.
there
are
two
affidavits
here.
there's
the
affidavit
of
the
superior,
admiral
schnackenberg,
“included
among
rear
admiral
howard's
official
duties
as
commander,
boston
navy
yard
is
and
was
on
september
8th,
1955,
the
furnishing
of
copies
to
the
massachusetts
congressional
delegation
of
his
official
notification
to
the
bureau
of
ships
of
personnel
action
taken
by
him.”
now,
he
states
in
unequivocal
terms.
it
was
included
among
his
official
duties
to
do
this
thing.
now,
admiral
howard
expresses
it
slightly
differently.
“in
the
course
of
my
official
duties
as
commander
of
boston
navy
yard
and
in
conformance,”
now
he's
got
a
double
head
and
if
you
notice
the
court
just
took
the
second
part
of
this.
they
didn't
say,
“in
the
course
of
my
official
duties
as
commander
and
in
conformance
with
navy
department
policy
of
keeping
them
advised.”
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
pardon,
sir?
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
225.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
this
is
admiral
howard's
affidavit
and
the
court
picked
up
starting
in
the
second
sentence
“in
conformance,”
as
i
recall
--
the
language
you
called
my
attention
to.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
no,
i
do
not
think
they
were
justified
in
drawing
that
conclusion
at
all,
your
honor,
because
you
have
the
uncontroverted
statement
of
schnackenberg
and
howard
says,
“in
accordance
with
his
duties
and”,
this
is
conjunctive,
this
was
another
reason,
because
of
the
policy
of
the
navy.”
they
keep
them
advised,
generally.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
all
right,
not
in
accordance,
in
the
course
of.
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
was
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
think
that's
the
interpretation,
but
i
do
not
think
of
--
of
that
that
is
what
they
were
leading
to,
but
they
do
not
dispute
or
they
do
not
say
anything
about
admiral
schnackenberg's
statement
which
has
included
among
admiral
howard's
official
duties
is
and
was
the
furnishing
of
copies.
now,
a
duty
is
--
if
it's
one
of
your
duties
to
furnish
a
thing,
it's
mandatory
on
you.
now,
have
i
--
would
again
like
to
stress
the
fact
that
had
the
court
felt
there
was
some
doubt
on
this
question,
and
may
i
add
this
thing
for
your
honor's
consideration.
it's
what
i
regard
as
a
finding
by
the
district
court.
it's
on
page
24
--
23,
i
beg,
your
honor.
the
complaint
in
the
affidavits
and
documents
referred
thereto
in
filed
in
support
of
this
motion
show
conclusively
that
the
statements
attributed
to
the
defendant
were
published
by
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties.
now,
that's
publication.
and
of
course
sending
it
to
the
members
of
congress
is
publication,
and
in
relation
to
matters
committed
to
him
for
determination.
now,
this
is
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
agreed
with
that
finding,
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
believe
that
they
would
have
taken
the
course
that
they
have
here.
in
other
words,
they
could
have
held
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
it.
they
could
have
drawn
a
inference.
of
course,
it
should
be
clearly
erroneous
if
they
all
accept
--
accept
that.
they
don't
discuss
anything
of
--
in
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
and
the
argument
of
this
case
in
the
matters
before
it,
this
thing
was
stressed
that
it
was
part
of
the
duties.
now,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
point
about
it
is
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
makes
it
pretty
clear
they
don't
believe
the
doctrine
should
be
extended
and
i
think
it's
an
unwholesome
thing
to
extend
it
to
new
categories.
that
is,
different
things.
in
other
words,
you
have
the
category
of
a
report
to
a
superior.
that's
one
category.
if
you
had
a
--
a
category
of
sending
a
report
to
congress,
they
say
that's
extending
it.
that's
a
new
category.
i
think
the
basic
reason
at
the
back
of
them
is
all
the
same,
but
at
least
they're
treating
them
in
these
categories.
the
category
of
sending
a
report
to
congress
they
felt
was
a
category
in
which
they
should
not
expand
this.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
no
qualified
privilege.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
i
think
maybe
there
would
be,
your
honor
please,
because
it
may
be
a
matter
that
was
up
to
his
discretion
as
to
whether
he
would
send
them
to
congress
or
not.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
no,
no,
your
honor.
that
wasn't
--
this
is
beyond
the
basis
that
this
was
a
--a
duty
on
his
part.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i'm
arguing
first
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
would
argue
both
if
it's
necessary.
i
say
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
he
had
no
discretion
on
sending
these
reports
to
congress.
he
did
have
discretion
in
compiling
the
report
that
he
sent
to
his
superiors.
in
other
words,
that
is
a
matter
that
he
had
to
make
the
decision
now
that
as
to
what
he
would
do
about
this
situation
that
existed
there.
that
was
entirely
within
his
discretion.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
now,
i
was
going
to
say
that
there
is
discretion
mixed
up
in
it
as
far
as
the
compilation
of
that
report
is
concerned.
and
that's
the
type
of
discretion
that
is
absolutely
immune.
now,
i
say
that
under
the
record
in
this
case,
after
he
had
exercised
his
discretion
and
made
that
report,
he
had
no
discretion,
under
the
record
in
this
case
to
--
and
sending
it
to
members
of
congress.
i
would
go
further
that
the
case
necessitates
the
argument
and
that
is
that
he
did
have
a
realm
of
discretion
as
to
whether
he
should
send
it
to
congress
or
not
because
of
the
matters
that
had
occurred
heretofore
in
this
field.
but
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
case
was
not
tried
--
the
case
was
not
tried
on
that
basis.
in
other
words,
there
is
not
evidence
in
here
to
make
the
difficulty,
which
i
think
you're
both
suggesting,
and
that
is
that
he
had
an
area
of
discretion
as
to
whether
he
would
send
it
to
congress
or
not.
it
was
assumed
that
the
record
made
established
that
he
was
under
a
duty.
once
he
had
made
the
report,
it
was
his
duty
to
send
it
to
congress.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
only
i
suppose
there's
an
issue
of
fact
in
this
extent
that
they
alleged
it
was
outside
of
it.
he
alleged
in
his
answer
that
it
was
in
his
line
of
duty
and
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
this
came
up
on
a
motion
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
affidavits
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
on
absolute
privilege.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
may
i
please
the
court.
in
a
few
minutes
that
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
clarify
what
we
believe
is
the
position
that
we
take
in
the
case,
at
least
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
may
i
state
at
the
outset
that
this
is
a
little
unusual
in
the
normal
government
case
where
we
represent
the
united
states
or
an
official
in
this
official
capacity
where
there's
an
attempt
to
bring
an
action
against
the
--
or
to
compel
its
action.
in
this
case,
admiral
howard,
should
the
decision
go
against
him,
will
be
held
personally
liable.
now,
in
that
situation
much
as
we
might
desire
a
broader
decision
in
this
case,
we
feel
it's
essential
in
deference
to
our
client
in
his
personal
interest
to
have
this
case
decided
on
this
narrower
ground
as
possible.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
stressed
yesterday
and
wish
to
re-stress
today
that
we
believe,
that
under
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
here
and
the
affidavits
filed
in
support
of
it
and
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
it
is
established
that
the
actions
of
admiral
howard,
in
this
case,
were
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
and
not
in
the
exercise
of
a
discretion.
i
--
i
stressed
that
yesterday
and
i'm
merely
trying
to
re-emphasize
that.
we
read
that
out
of
the
motion,
out
of
admiral
schnackenberg's
definite
statement
which
appears
on
page
20
that
it
was
a
--
there's
a
--
at
21,
i
beg
your
pardon,
that
it
was
his
duty
to
furnish
copies.
out
of
admiral
howard's
affidavit
on
22
which
he
said,
“in
the
course
of
my
official
duties,”
he
furnished
this
information.
now,
i
have
re-checked
and
there
was
no
definite
regulation
if
your
honor
please,
dealing
with
matters
of
this
kind.
but
again,
i
would
like
to
stress
and
touch
upon
the
proposition
that
not
all
matters
inside
the
department
are
governed
by
specific
regulations.
there
are
lots
of
orders
and
duties
that
are
assigned
by
either
tradition
or
by
word
of
mouth.
but
we
have
these
two
uncontradicted
affidavits
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
district
court,
on
page
23,
made
a
finding
that
the
statements
were
published,
and
publication
of
course
is
what
gives
rise
to
an
action
for
defamation
in
the
discharge
of
his
official
duties.
now,
we
believe
in
those
circumstances
it
was
not
opened
to
the
court
of
appeals
unless
accept
this
finding
aside
on
the
ground
that
it
was
grossly
erroneous
and
we
would
challenge
that
because
the
uncontradicted
evidence
discloses
as
supports
this
finding
of
the
district
court,
that
these
were
actions
performed
with
him
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
official
duties,
that
he
was
required
to
do
it.
now,
we
think
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
is
the
disposition
which
this
court
should
make
on
the
fact
that
there's
a
narrow
case
whether
there
was
--
they're
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
in
not
filing
counter
affidavits
and
not
raising
an
appeal,
the
question
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court
was
incorrect
and
should
be
set
aside,
those
are
not
in
this
case.
and
that
there
is
a
simple
finding
of
the
district
court
on
reverse
that
the
acts
performed
during
the
course
of
his
duty.
now,
turning
to
the
second
point
of
this
case,
and
that
also
was
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
your
honor,
as
writing
into
that,
a
second
discretion
every
item
that
he
thought
was
newsworthy.
if
there
was
a
definite
issuance
of
an
order
by
the
secretary
of
labor
saying
that
in
any
labor
dispute
in
which
the
department
is
represented,
he
should
make
available
to
the
press
his
comments
upon
that
or
his
findings
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
any
report
of
that.
but
suppose
that
he
had
no
discretion
in
the
circumstances.
yes,
i
would
say
that
was
the
act
of
a
superior
officer
that
he
was
carrying
into
effect.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
and
that
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
if
he
followed
that
particular
instruction.
that
would
be
the
thrust
of
it.
now,
within
the
realms
of
that
i
find
it
in
part
as
a
--
there
would
be
disciplinary
measures,
of
course,
inside
the
department.
it
would
probably
cost
him
his
job
if
he
indulged
in
any
--
misused
his
office
for
that
purpose.
but
the
--
but
the
discipline,
the
punishment
would
have
to
be
under
departmental
and
not
a
pursuit
of
a
private
individual.
i
think
the
necessities
of
the
case,
i
would
like
to
stress
one
thing
more
though.
the
military
department
has
much
more
strict
rules
of
obedience
and
the
orders
passing
from
one
person
to
another
that
are
in
question
would
be
--
to
be
carried
into
effect.
but
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
significant
to
the
thrust
of
my
argument.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
in
issuing
the
reports
to
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
to
the
congressional
delegation
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
--
that
particular
point.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
now,
i
would
like
to
touch
on
the
other
side,
if
there
were
some
discretion
in
his
action
on
that
type.
in
other
words,
if
it
were
within
the
scope
of
his
duty
but
it
was
left
to
his
discretion
whether
he
should
send
it
to
the
congress
or
not,
which
is
really
the
overall
point
and
the
point
is
in
spalding
versus
vilas.
if
i
could
just
read
this
short
part
from
page
18
of
the
--
in
the
act
--
as
for
my
brief
and
this
is
a
citation
from
spalding
versus
vilas
and
we
think
it
applies
definitely
here
except
that
that
was
the
case
of
a
cabinet
member
and
not
on
an
inferior
officer.
in
exercising
the
functions
of
his
office,
the
head
of
an
executive
department
keeping
within
the
limits
of
his
authority
should
not
be
under
an
apprehension,
that
the
motives
that
controls
his
official
conduct
may
at
any
time
becomes
the
subject
of
inquiry
in
a
civil
suit
for
damages.
it
would
seriously
cripple
the
proper
and
effective
administration
of
public
affairs
as
entrusted
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
if
he
were
subjected
to
any
such
restraint.
he
may
have
the
legal
authority
to
act
but
he
may
have
such
large
discretion
in
the
premises
that
it
will
not
always
be
his
absolute
duty
to
exercise
the
authority
with
which
he
was
invested.
but
if
he
acts,
having
authority,
this
conduct
cannot
be
made
the
foundation
of
a
suit
against
him
personally
for
damages
even
if
the
circumstances
showed
that
he
is
not
disagreeably
impressed
by
the
fact
that
his
action
endures
the
effect
that
of
another
official.
now,
we
think
--
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that's
right.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
made
myself
unclear,
i'm
afraid,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
that
--
that
is
our
--
that
is
our
basic
position,
a
narrow
ground
that
i
heard.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
i
say
if
that
is
rejected
by
this
court,
or
i
should
have
premised
it
on
that
basis.
in
other
words,
if
this
court
felt
that
notwithstanding
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
he
was
not
under
any
duty
to
act
but
merely
had
authority
to
act,
or
not
as
a
case
might
be,
then
in
those
circumstances,
this
court
we
feel
should
then
decide
the
vilas
--
the
problem.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
secondary
position,
if
i
might
say,
if
the
court
does
not
agree
with
the
primary
position
that
i
urge.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
if
you
hold
that
he
was
not
under
an
absolute
duty
to
this
then
this
court
should
consider
the
application
of
the
vilas
case
if
it
were
only
a
discretion
that
he
were
exercising.
we
do
not
think
it
was
a
discretion.
but
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
position
then
we
think
you
have
to
reach
the
vilas
case.
do
i
make
myself
clear
on
this
alternative
grounds?
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
no,
we
do
not.
we
do
not
think
you
need
to
reach
the
vilas
question.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
we
do
urge
that.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
well,
that
--
our
point
is
that
if
you
disagree
with
our
basic
problem
and
do
reach
the
vilas
position
then
we
urge
that
the
discretion
conferred
in
him
under
the
vilas
case
and
in
many
cases
in
the
federal
district
courts,
the
lower
courts,
sustain
the
proposition
that
he
still
should
be
accorded
to
absolute
privilege
so
that
he
would
have
the
freedom
of
acting
undeterred
by
fear
of
a
civil
action.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
he
was
a
captain
at
the
time
that
this
report
was
issued.
he
was
subsequently
promoted
to
an
admiral.
he
presently
is
an
admiral.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
he
was
in
command
of
the
boston
navy
yard.
mr.
paul
a.
sweeney
it
was
directed
to
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
ships
under
the
chief
of
the
office
of
industrial
relations
to
the
navy
but
it
went
through
channels.
his
reports
go
--
he
was
under
the
--
immediately
--
immediate
military
supervision
of
the
commandant
of
the
first
naval
district,
so
his
reports,
and
according
to
navy
procedure
would
go
from
him
to
the
commandant
of
the
first
naval
district
to
probably
would
put
an
endorsement
forwarded
to
the
official
to
whom
it
was
ultimately
directed.
it
will
go
to
channels
that
way
but
it
was
directed
to
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
ships
and
the
chief
of
the
office
of
industrial
relations.
if
the
court
have
no
further
problem
--
