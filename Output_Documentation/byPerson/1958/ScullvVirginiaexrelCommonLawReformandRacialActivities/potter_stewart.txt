more
generally,
may
i
ask
you
this.
assume
a
state
which
for
decades
in
its
constitution,
in
its
legislation,
in
its
customs
and
in
its
ways
of
social
organization
has
had
the
school
segregated
on
the
basis
of
the
race
of
the
students.
and
--
and
then
in
1954
decision
of
this
court
says
that
it
violates
the
constitution.
would
it
necessarily
be
an
improper
legislative
purpose
for
such
a
state
to
make
an
investigation
as
to
the
manner
and
extent
or
the
impact
of
that
decision
within
its
particular
state?
when
it
was
going
to
be,
when
it
was
going
to
involve,
what
new
legislation
was
going
to
be
necessary,
how
many,
how
fast
it
was
going
to
come,
how
much
impetus
there
was
within
the
state
for
a
sudden
change?
would
any
of
those
purposes
be
an
improper
subject
to
the
legislative
investigation
within
the
state?
justice

mr.
hall,
this
speech
with
the
governors
was
apparently
not
a

not
a
political
speech,
simply
quoted
in
the
newspaper.
apparently,
it
was
a
message
he
sent
to

special
session
of
the
general
assembly.
was
the

in
your
state,
does
--
does
the
calling
of
a
special
session
had
to
have
a
specific
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
what
the
purpose
of
this
special
session
was
announced
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
quoted
on
page
8
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
as
saying,
“i
come
before
you
today
for
the
purpose
of
submitting
recommendations
to
continue
our
system
of
segregated
public
schools.”
would
you
concede
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
creation
of
this
investigating
committee
was
to
continue
in
virginia,
our
--
the
system
of
segregating
public
schools
--
that
would
not
be
a
proper
legislative
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
as
he
points
out,
he's
speaking
personally
and
he
was
--
maybe
the
legislature
for
which
he
was
an
agent
would
not
have
had
the
same
opinion.
