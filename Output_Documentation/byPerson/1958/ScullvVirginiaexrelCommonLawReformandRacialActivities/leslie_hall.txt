mr.
leslie
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
want
to,
again,
touch
briefly,
i
want
to
emphasize
the
purposes
for
which
this
committee
was
formed.
mr.
rauh
has
stated
some
of
the
purposes
but
i
think
that
he
is
more
or
less
crossed
over
there.
if
you
read
the
act
itself
which
is
chapter
37
of
the
acts
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia,
exposition
1956,
you
will
find
that
one
of
the
purposes
was
for
the
committee
to
make
investigations
and
recommendations
one
as
to
the
taxable
status
of
organizations
engaged
in
racial
litigation.
the
second
purpose
was
to
investigate
and
make
recommendations
back
to
the
general
assembly
with
respect
to
the
tax
exempt
status
of
donations
and
contributions
to
such
organization.
and,
the
last
that
has
been
discussed
quite
a
bit
of
length
here
is
with
respect
to
the
laws
relating
to
champerty,
barratry,
and
maintenance.
now,
surely
gentlemen,
all
of
these
are
proper
legislative
functions.
and
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases,
the
only
way
that
a
legislative
body
can
properly
operate
and
determine
what
legislation
should
be
enacted
is
for
that
legislative
body
to
act
through
its
committees.
i
think
that
the
number
of
cases
on
that
particular
point
are
so
many
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
them
at
this
time.
now,
the
contentions
made
by
the
petitioner
as
to
the
ultimate
purposes
of
the
committee
and
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
are
not
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case.
it
maybe
supported
by
some
remarks
made
by
mr.
rauh
in
his
argument
to
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county
and
supported
by
some
matters
submitted
in
his
brief
here
on
the
petition
that
is
before
the
court
today
in
the
appendix
and
in
the
footnotes
when
he
refers
to
such
material
as
the
washington
post
and
times-herald
and
quotes
of
great
length
from
that
organ
and
from
theology
today
and
from
the
southern
school
news,
but
none
of
those
things
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
your
honor.
therefore,
i
think
that
the
matters
mentioned
by
him
and
quoted
by
him
along
those
lines
are
entitled
to
no
consideration
whatsoever.
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
questions
asked
of
mr.
scull
were
pertinent
to
an
--
to
an
authorized
investigation
by
an
appropriately
organized
committee
of
a
legislative
body.
of
course,
we
contend
that
those
questions
were
pertinent.
it
cannot
be
assumed
on
the
best
assertion
of
a
person
who
presumes
to
defy
who
court
comes
to
jurisdiction
that
it
duly
constituted
legislative
body
would
deliberately
exceed
or
abuses
authority.
as
i
said
before,
the
things
that
the
committee
was
delegated
to
investigate
certainly
were
matters
which
could
be
made
subjects
with
appropriate
legislation
by
the
legislature
of
virginia
or
the
legislature
of
any
other
state
in
the
union.
now,
as
the
petitioner's
knowledge
of
the
purposes
of
the
inquiry,
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
thing
that's
been
omitted
by
mr.
rauh.
i
don't
know
whether
he
did
it
intentionally
or
whether
he
just
forgot
about
it
and
that
is
this.
the
subpoena
itself
which
is
printed
in
the
record
at
page
70
is
petitioner's
exhibit
number
one
before
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county
has
set
out
the
bill.
after
reciting
that
the
subpoena
was
issued
under
the
authority
delegated
by
chapter
37
and
so
forth,
the
petitioner
here
today,
mr.
scull,
was
directed
to
appear
before
the
committee
in
the
circuit
courtroom
number
one
of
the
arlington
county
courthouse,
arlington
virginia
on
friday
the
28th
of
september
1957
at
10:00
a.m.
eastern
daylight
savings
time
to
produce
before
said
committee
and
note
this.
“all
papers,
records,
and
documents
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control
pertaining
to
his
participation
and
litigation
relating
to
integration
of
the
races
in
the
public
schools
of
fairfax
county
virginia
or
any
other
place,
and
to
testify
the
truth
to
say
in
connection
with
an
investigation
being
made
by
the
said
committee
relating
to
the
need
or
lack
of
need
for
legislation
pertaining
to
the
activities
of
corporations,
associations
and
other
like
groups
which
seek
to
influence,
encourage
or
promote
litigation
relating
to
racial
activities
in
this
state.
all
of
those
things
set
forth
in
that
subpoena
were
matters
that
were
delegated
to
the
committee
that
inquire
into
by
the
act
of
the
general
assembly.
mr.
leslie
hall
that
is
the
usual
form
that
was
used
in
some
other
areas
of
the
state
so
we
did
use
a
slightly
different
form,
but
the
forms
that
were
used
were
very
similar
to
this
throughout
the
whole
state.
we
had
hearings
in
richmond.
we
had
hearings
in
fonville,
in
north
arlington
and
alexandria
and
a
similar
subpoena
was
used
in
each
case.
i
might
say
however
that
at
the
original
hearing
in
richmond,
certain
officials
of
the
naacp
were
summons
to
appear
before
the
committee
at
the
state
capital
and
were
asked
to
produce
certain
specific
documents
most
of
which
they
did
furnish,
but
some
of
which
they
refused
to
give
us.
the
ones
they
refused
to
give
us
by
the
way
happened
to
be
a
list
of
membership
and
this
court
has
now
ruled
in
the
alabama
case
that
it
was
not
proper
to
ask
for.
we
never
did
press
that
particular
phase
of
the
investigation,
to
ask
the
list
of
memberships
for
the
organization.
at
that
same
meeting
--
and
mr.
rauh
made
a
point
of
this
and
he
talked
about
this
being
a
one
hundred
to
one
investigation.
a
representative
of
the
defenders
of
the
states
rights
and
states
sovereign,
and
states
right
was
called
before
the
committee
and
produced
voluminous
records
of
that
organization
and
testified
under
oath
and
the
committee
was
now
able
to
find
whether
that
organization
had
ever
participated
in
or
encourage
any
kind
of
litigation
in
the
state
of
virginia.
in
fact,
we
did
make
some
preliminary
investigations
of
other
organizations
that
had
been
brought
to
our
attention
and
we
would
never
able
to
find
that
any
other
organization
had
encouraged
litigation
or
participated
in
litigation
in
the
state
of
virginia.
now,
as
to
his
further
knowledge,
as
to
the
--
mr.
scull's
further
knowledge,
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
inquiry,
i
might
point
out
that
in
his
statement
that
he
furnished
to
the
committee
which
appears
at
page
75
of
the
record
starting
on
page
74.
about
the
middle
of
page
75,
he
makes
the
following
statement.
“i
have
fully
recognized
the
public
right
to
know
the
officers,
directors
and
general
purposes
of
every
organization
which
sets
itself
up
before
the
public
in
any
way.
was
this
as
a
matter
of
public
information
for
every
organization
to
which
i
belong
or
contribute.i
have
nothing
to
add
to
what
the
committee
can
obtain
directly
from
the
organization
in
which
it
may
have
an
end
reason.
now,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
he
says
he
doesn't
have
anything
to
hide
and
yet
after
he
was
asked
the
very
first
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
fairfax
county
council
on
human
relations?”
he
refused
to
answer,
submitted
a
statement
and
from
then
on
refused
to
answer
every
question
asked
by
the
committee
on
the
basis
of
this
statement.
mr.
leslie
hall
no.
but
he's
contradictory
i
think,
your
honor
when
he
gave
the
statement
in
which
he
says
that
the
public
has
the
right
to
know
all
of
these
things
and
then
turns
around
and
refuses
himself
to
give
that
information
and
says
that
that
information
can
be
obtained
from
the
organization
themselves.
now,
in
that
connection,
it's
my
opinion
and
i've
always
found
it
to
be
true
in
the
practice
of
law
that
the
only
way
you
can
obtain
the
information
as
to
the
operation
of
organizations
is
by
questioning
those
who
are
connected
with
such
organizations.
the
organizations
are
being
preachers
of
statute,
most
of
them
that
is
the
corporations
especially
are
official
persons,
have
no
way
of
answering
except
through
their
officers
and
members
and
so.
so,
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
it
appeared
that
mr.
scull
might
have
been
--
had
membership
in
some
of
these
organizations.
the
committee
wanted
to
question
him
about
the
operations
and
the
activities
of
those
organizations.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
can
say
this
that
checking
the
records
heretofore
is
one
of
which
is
the
naacp
conference
of
branches
which
is
an
unincorporated
association
with
his
headquarters
in
richmond,
the
naacp
or
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
incorporated
which
is
a
new
york
corporation.
and
i
don't
think
he
was
asked
about
the
naacp
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
but
that's
also
a
new
york
corporation.
mr.
leslie
hall
not
until
1947,
your
honor
when
these
two
committees,
the
vote
right
committee
and
the
thomson
committee
were
organized
just
prior
to
the
time
that
their
officers
were
called
to
testify,
they
did
qualify,
but
we
were
informed
by
the
officers
in
richmond
that
the
naacp
itself
is
--
it
incorporates
in
the
parent
body
had
been
operating
in
virginia
since
1919
and
never
had
made
any
effort
to
qualify
under
the
laws
pertaining
to
foreign
corporations
up
until
1957.
the
same
thing
was
true
with
the
naacp
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
although
they
admitted
they
have
been
operating
in
the
state
prior
to
that
time.
now
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
may
--
mr.
leslie
hall
he
could
do
that,
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
on
page
73,
your
honor,
when
mr.
scull
was
represented
by
mr.
finelli
at
that
time.
and
when
the
statement
prepared
either
by
mr.
scull
with
the
assistance
of
his
counsel
was
submitted
to
the
committee,
he
asked
what
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
was
at
that
time.and
in
response
to
that
question,
chairman
thomson
said
starting
about
the
middle
of
page,
“the
subjects
under
inquiry
by
the
committee,
mr.
scull,
are
threefold.
one,
several
of
which
primarily
do
not
deal
with
you
but
i
will
nonetheless
state
all
three,
the
tax
exempt
or
tax
status
of
both
racial
organizations
in
virginia
and
the
contributions
made
by
such
organizations
that
is
the
taxable
status
in
here,
the
integration
--
it's
rather
the
integration
on
the
public
school
system
of
virginia
or
the
general
welfare
of
virginia.
third
--
the
third
one
deals
with
the
violation
of
certain
statutes
which
are
designed
to
prepare
champerty,
barratry,
maintenance,
or
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.”
so,
he
was
informed
at
the
outset
in
--
in
addition
to
what
was
said
in
the
subpoena
itself.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
now,
i
think
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
you
have
to
refer
back
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
if
that
were
true.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
now,
we
get
to
page
30
and
mr.
rauh
was
questioning
mr.
thomson
before
the
court
and
the
matter
came
on
before
the
court
on
a
rule.
and
in
that
particular
instance,
mr.
rauh
said
if
--
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
“is
it
correct
mr.
thomson
that
you
referred
to
three
different
possible
subjects
on
the
inquiry
on
page
four?”
and
the
answer
was
“that
is
correct.”
and
then
he
goes
on
with
some
other
questions
when
you
get
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
page.
that
wouldn't
matter
if
mr.
justice
stewart
was
talking
about
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
suppose
so,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
it's
rather
vague
now
or
whether
that's
the
--
the
fault
of
the
court
reporter
or
whether
it
was
--
what
was
actually
said.i
was
there
all
the
time
and
there
was
a
lot
of
confusion
back
at
the
court.
mr.
leslie
hall
and
there
were
a
lot
of
words
bending
back
and
forth
between
mr.
rauh
and
mr.
thomson
along
that
line
but
the
last
answer
on
the
bottom
of
page
30
says
“no,
no.
i
think
in
the
connection
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
the
one
spoken
on
first
did
not
apply.
it
only
did
allow
one
did
apply
that
i
was
making.”
mr.
leslie
hall
you've
asked
me
to
do
the
impossible,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
think
--
and
i
want
to
go
back
and
look
back
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
think
it
was.
it
said
all
three.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
yes.
just
before
that
would
state
for
the
record
so
that
it
is
clear
on
the
record
which
ones
you
were
referring
to
that
did
not
deal
with
mr.
scull
as
to
the
violation
of
those
statutes
dealing
with
champerty,
barratry,
and
maintenance,
in
general,
unauthorized
practice
of
the
law.
question,
those
did
not
deal
with
mr.
scull.
and
then
the
answer
is
the
one
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
talking
about
is
not
clear
to
me
or
him
either,
i'm
sure.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
only
thing
i
could
say
your
honor,
in
that
respect
is
that
mr.
scull
was
definitely
informed
at
the
committee
hearing
what
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
was.
he
was
informed
by
the
subpoena
and
also
informed
by
the
chairman
at
that
time
and
on
the
basis
of
the
information
that
he
had,
he
still
refused
to
answer
any
questions
put
to
him
by
the
committee
except
for
identifying
questions
such
as
his
name
and
address
and
things
of
that
matter.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
did
tell
him
that
if
mr.
thomson
has
specifically
waived
that,
that
--
that
would
be
binding
i
suppose.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
sir,
i
don't.
i
consider
that
all
of
the
questions
asked
for
mr.
scull
were
preliminary
only
in
nature.
none
of
them
got
to
the
need
of
the
thing.
he
was
merely
asked
and
that
started
the
whole
thing
of
“are
you
a
member
of
the
fairfax
county
council
on
human
relations?”
in
which
he
refuse
to
reply
and
furnish
the
statement.
and
from
the
then
on,
he
used
the
statement
as
a
basis
for
his
refusal
to
reply
to
any
other
questions.
mr.
leslie
hall
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
what
type
of
organization
that
was
there
in
that
corporation.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
true.
and,
there
would
be
no
reason
if
that
is
so
as
mr.
rauh
pointed
out
that
these
various
organizations
that
he
was
asked
about
happened
to
be
a
well
recognized
and
well
thought
of
organizations,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
him
to
refuse
to
answer
as
to
whether
he
had
any
connection.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir,
because
we
were
trying
to
find
out
about
the
taxable
status
of
organizations
that
promoted
litigation.
we
were
trying
to
find
out
about
whether
to
make
any
recommendations
as
to
the
tax
exempt
status
with
donations
and
contributions
just
like
the
organizations.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
it
was
probably
proceeded
a
little
bit
further
as
to
whether
he
was
an
officer
and
has
a
knowledge
of
the
endless
working
of
such
an
organization
but
we
haven't
got
that
for.
and
to
say
these
were
only
preliminary
questions
which
couldn't
possibly
make
mr.
scull
by
answering
yes
or
no
or
explaining
what
his
connection
was.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
missed
but
respect
--
mr.
justice
black,
in
my
experience
in
trying
cases,
it's
always
necessary
to
ask
a
few
preliminary
questions
in
order
to
be
able
to
lead
up
to
something
that
you're
really
trying
to
get
at.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
he
would
have
some
bearing
on
it
into
this
connection
and
that
is
if
he
had
a
membership
in
a
certain
organization,
he
would
have
probably
some
knowledge
as
to
what
that
organization
did,
what
his
activities
were.
he
might
know
more
but
you
didn't
get
to
the
question
--
did
he
give
to
what
he
actually
did.
mr.
leslie
hall
he
didn't
give
us
a
chance
to
get.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well
the
way
he
was
answering,
we
couldn't
get
anyway
anyhow.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
the
only
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
leslie
hall
we're
not
being
a
member
of
the
committee
but
merely
counsel
for
the
committee.
i
wouldn't
know
what
the
committee
would
recommend.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
but
now
i
want
to
say
this.
and
that
is
that
--
he
was
only
asked
as
to
his
membership
in
one
organization.
he
never
was
asked
as
to
his
membership
in
any
other
organization.
he
was
asked
some
other
questions.
mr.
rauh
has
counted
them
and
he
said
there
were
31
questions
altogether.
some
of
the
other
questions
dealt
with
the
matter
of
whether
he
had
made
any
contribution
to
the
carrying
on
of
lawsuits
of
the
b'nai
b'rith.
he
wouldn't
ask
whether
he
made
any
contributions
to
the
b'nai
b'rith.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
it's
very
minor
when
i
suppose.
mr.
leslie
hall
unless
he
charged
them.
mr.
leslie
hall
if
he
paid
for
the
box
himself
but
if
he
charged
him
for
the
use
of
it,
of
course
that
would
be
a
contribution.
he
was
asked
also
whether
he
paid
any
attorney's
fees
in
connection
with
any
litigation
in
the
state
of
virginia
in
which
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
the
same
statement.
he
was
asked
whether
he
paid
any
court
cost
in
connection
with
any
of
the
cases
which
he
refused
to
answer.
i
think
that
was
all
a
proper
legislative
function.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
that's
the
only
other
one
that
i
recall,
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
--
if
i
--
i
was
incorrect
in
that.
i
apologize.
we
take
the
position,
your
honor
that
in
view
of
his
statement,
page
75,
that
i've
already
referred
to,
he
couldn't
possibly
be
hurt
in
any
way
by
answering
the
questions
that
worked
with
him
and
in
fact
he
conceded
that
much
in
that
statement
that
he
did
think.
he
said
that
he
fully
recognized
the
public
right
to
know
the
officers,
directors
and
general
purposes
of
every
organization
which
sets
example
of
the
court
of
public
in
any
way.
but
since
this
is
a
matter
of
public
information,
i
have
nothing
to
add
and
so
forth.
we
contend
therefore
that
his
refusals
were
purely
arbitrary
and
well
without
any
legal
basis
whatsoever.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
know
whether
he
would
or
not,
gentlemen.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
know.
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
i
wouldn't
say
he
couldn't
be.
i
mean,
you
could
be
a
member
of
a
lot
of
different
organizations
and
some
people
might
not
like
if
they
hold
it
against
you
and
trying
to
--
or
try
to
exercise
certain
reprises
was
against
you
or
ignore
you
and
not
everything
to
do
with
you
just
because
you
belong
to
those
organizations.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
--
i
said
i
didn't
see
how
you
could
be
--
i
believe
this
is
--
now
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
i
--
it
wasn't
going
to
take
very
long.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
his
position,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
thought
i
touched
on
them
briefly
but
i'll
try
to
do
it
again
and
that
is
this.
i
thought
we
were
here
on
a
record.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
anything
with
regard
to
a
plan
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
about
any
of
the
other
states
mentioned
in
this
southern
school
news
i
believe
it
is
which
traces
the
history
of
certain
legislation
in
a
number
of
states.
that
is
something
that
was
added
to
the
brief
that
was
furnished
by
the
petitioner
and
there's
no
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
leslie
hall
but
just
because
of
the
fact
that
certain
acts
were
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
on
the
same
day
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
they
were
all
part
of
the
general
scheme.
mr.
leslie
hall
now,
well,
i
assume
this
is
quoted
correctly
from
the
governor's
message
to
the
session
which
enacted
this
legislation.
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
governor
might
have
said
that.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
that's
no
part
of
the
record
here
in
this
case.
mr.
leslie
hall
are
we
going
to
take
speeches
that
are
made
by
people
and
things
that
appeared
in
the
washington
post
and
times-herald
news
article?
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
message
even
if
he
--
it
is
a
matter
for
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
which
says
anything
about
formation
of
the
committee
to
investigate
the
violations
of
certain
laws
or
changes
in
the
certain
laws.
mr.
leslie
hall
certainly,
the
acts
of
the
legislatures
and
maybe
so
the
messages
of
governors
but
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
message
of
the
governor
that
deals
with
--
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
leslie
hall
and
i
don't
find
a
poison
in
it
because
the
acts
were
enacted
the
same
day.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
think
that
we
have
this
one
thing
and
we
have
the
whole
matter
considered
by
the
lower
court.
we
have
a
matter
again
considered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
virginia
which
upheld
the
lower
court
and
the
burden
is
on
the
counsel
here
to
try
to
convince
this
court
that
those
two
courts
were
wrong.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
think
it
does.
it's
my
understanding.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
know
of
any
but
my
recollection
of
it
was
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
enacting
laws
to
cope
with
the
situation
in
virginia
that
was
created
by
the
decision
in
the
brown
case
in
the
enactment.
mr.
leslie
hall
if
that
were
the
only
purpose
of
the
committee,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
leslie
hall
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
in
the
case
of
naacp
against
the
alabama
that
dealt
with
that
point.
and
i
don't
think
it
can
be
expressed
to
that
point.
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
in
calling
an
individual
before
a
committee
and
asking
him
about
this
membership.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
if
you're
going
to
stretch
the
alabama
case
that
for
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
think
there
is.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
well,
i
just
say
it
is
in
that
connection.
and
as
i
understand
the
case
of
naacp
versus
alabama
where
the
attorney
general
sought
to
obtain
list
of
membership
that
in
that
case,
of
course,
there
was
a
punishment
to
contempt
and
quite
a
heavy
fine,
if
i
remember
it
correctly.
if
i
understand
that
case
correctly
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
it
was
to
prevent
--
the
reason
for
this
court
(inaudible)
was
to
prevent
the
heads
of
organizations
from
being
required
to
furnish
an
entire
list
of
thousands
of
members
which
might
result
in
some
bad
effect
on
those
individual
members.
now,
if
a
member
himself
is
called
for
a
committee
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
things
that
we
were
trying
to
determine
here,
i
don't
think
that
that
was
even
involved
in
the
alabama
case.
if
--
if
an
individual
member
is
called
before
a
committee
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
need
or
lack
of
need
for
further
legislation
along
these
lines,
then
i
don't
think
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
merely
because
of
the
fact
that
he
happens
to
be
a
member
of
the
organization.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
the
only
thing
i
have
to
say
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
is
this.
as
i
said
before
that
the
only
way
that
a
legislative
body
can
determine
what
legislation
is
appropriate
is
to
--
to
inform
committees
and
call
witnesses
before
the
committees
and
make
tons
of
fact
and
recommendations
to
the
entire
legislative
body.
now,
if
any
witnesses
called
before
a
committee
of
a
legislature
whether
it
be
of
virginia,
alabama,
new
hampshire,
new
york,
oregon,
washington,
any
other
state
in
the
union
can
come
before
their
committee
and
say,
“i
refuse
to
answer
because
of
the
fact
that
i
think
it
--
it
violates
my
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
no
legislative
committee
in
any
state
in
this
union
would
ever
be
able
to
function
in
the
legislatures
of
the
states
might
as
well
go
out
of
business.”
mr.
leslie
hall
your
honor,
we
don't
have
the
record
here
of
all
of
the
proceedings
of
the
committee.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
yes.
there
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
see
why
not.
we
are
here
on
the
proposition
and
i
--
i
think
it's
a
very
succinct
proposition
as
to
whether
or
not
these
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
committee
was
formed.
and
i
contend
that
they
are.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
now,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
deal
the
record
of
any
kind
to
make
any
kind
of
report
to
legislature
without
questioning
somebody.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
now,
if
you
want
me
to
go
outside
the
record,
your
honor,
i
can
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
tell
you
that
there
were
some
other
inquiries
along
those
lines.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.[laughter]
the
naacp
finds
voluminous
records
to
us
--
about
their
financial
operations.and
certainly,
other
organizations
did
too.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
this
was
just
in
connection
with
the
entire
(inaudible)
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
only
thing
i
can
say
in
regard
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
i
think
the
record
is
replete
with
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
correct.
yes.
anything
else,
gentlemen?
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
we
take
the
position
that
it
does.
mr.
leslie
hall
[laughs]
