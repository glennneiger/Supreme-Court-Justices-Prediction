mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
affirming
petitioner
sentence
of
fine
and
imprisonment
for
refusing
to
answer
certain
questions
put
to
him
by
a
racial
activities
investigating
committee
of
the
virginia
legislature.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
before
your
honors
today
as
it
has
been
throughout
these
proceedings
that
the
action
of
the
virginia
racial
activities
investigating
committee
in
summoning
and
questioning
petitioner
about
his
association
with
various
civic,
political
and
religious
organizations
unlawfully
infringed
upon
his
constitutional
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
of
assembly.
this
is,
i
believe,
the
first
case
to
come
before
this
court
involving
the
infringement
of
these
constitutional
rights
by
an
investigating
committee
in
the
area
of
racial
activity.
the
court
did
of
course
at
the
last
term
consider
a
somewhat
similar
effort
to
harass
the
supporters
of
desegregation
in
the
naacp
case.
and
of
course,
the
court
has
considered
the
activities
of
investigating
committees
in
the
so-called
anti-communist
appeal
as
the
last
and
the
next
cases
will
be,
but
i
believe
that
the
first
of
its
type
which
involved
an
infringement
based
on
a
racial
activities
investigating
committee.
and
it
is
our
confident
belief
and
it
will
be
our
purpose
to
show
that
petitioner's
case
is
then
a
fortiori
case
on
the
basis
of
naacp
last
year
in
watkins
and
sweezy
before
them.
to
fully
understand
the
massive
intrusion
on
fundamental
liberties
involved
in
this
case,
a
small
part
at
least
of
the
background
of
the
resolutions
setting
up
the
investigating
committee
must
be
briefly
stated.
on
february
1st,
1956,
approximately
or
almost
two
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
brown
case,
the
virginia
general
assembly
adopted
an
interposition
resolution
interposing
the
will
of
virginia
against
the
decision
of
this
court.
on
august
27,
1956,
some
six
months
later,
in
an
implementation
of
that
interposition
resolution,
an
extra
session
of
the
virginia
legislature
met.
the
governor
in
opening
the
virginia
legislature's
extra
session
submitted
what
he
called,
and
i
quote
“recommendations
to
continue
our
system
of
segregated
public
schools”.
and
on
september
29th,
1956,
this
extra
session
of
the
general
assembly
adapted
more
than
a
dozen
bills
to
carry
out
the
governor's
recommendation
to
continue
our
system
of
segregated
public
schools.
this
was
what
is
colloquially
and
commonly
known
virginia's
plan
of
massive
resistance.
and
it
had
two
facets,
these
dozen
or
more
bills.
first,
was
the
direct
assault
on
this
court's
decision.
that
was
the
provision
to
close
the
school
if
any
negro
were
definitely
assigned
to
a
then
white
school.
it
was
a
pupil
placement
act
which
was
declared
on
constitutional
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
third
was
denied
here.
it
was
the
appropriations
act
which
finally
and
also
indicated
virginia's
massive
resistance.
there
were
about
seven
or
eight
statutes
in
this
area
directly
contravening
the
decision
of
this
court,
but
that
was
not
enough.
in
addition
to
the
direct
assault
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
came
what
i
would
refer
to
as
the
indirect
assault.
in
seven
statutes
aimed
at
those
who
would
bring
lawsuits
to
enforce
the
rights
which
this
court
indicated
in
brown
v.
board
of
education.
these
were
the
seven
so-called
anti-naacp
bills.
two
of
these
were
registration
provisions
which
were
declared
unconstitutional
by
a
three-judge
statutory
court,
and
which
is
before
your
honors
in
number
127.
three
of
these
were
anti
--
so-called
anti-barratry
statutes,
one
of
which
was
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
three-judge
court
in
number
127
and
two
of
which
--
and
the
remaining
two
were
not
passed
on
because
it
was
left
for
the
state
court
to
clarify
what
these
three-judge
federal
statutory
court
thought
was
ambiguous.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
is
number
--
i
think
it's
here,
harrison
v.
naacp,
your
honor.
and
finally,
the
last
two
statutes
are
investigating
committee
statutes.
that
is
the
final
two
of
the
seven
indirect
assaults
on
this
court's
decision
where
investigating
--
the
investigating
committee
wasn't
enough
to
pass
one
investigating
resolution.
the
virginia
legislature
on
the
same
day
they
passed
this
other
dozen
bills
passed
too.
one
of
those
was
here
in
number
84
and
was
declared
loose
because
it
had
expired.
the
other
is
here
today
in
mr.
scull's
case.
these
investigating
committees
overlapped.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
record
is
clear
on
the
overlap
at
page
26
to
28.
but
in
addition
to
their
overlap,
if
your
honors
please,
this
is
the
first
time
in
virginia
history
that
any
legislative
committee
was
given
a
subpoena
power
and
the
right
to
operate
outside
of
the
regular
session.
this
was
all
part
and
parcel
of
massive
resistance.
so
much
as
to
how
--
how
we
got
on
the
books
resolution
that
is
involved
here.
the
resolution
itself
is
contained
in
full
at
page
4
of
petitioner's
brief.
the
committee
called
the
committee
on
law
reform
in
racial
activity
is
also
known
as
the
thomson
committee
for
its
chairman.
the
committee
is
authorized
in
section
2
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
activities
of
organizations
seeking
to
influence,
encourage,
or
promote
litigation
relating
to
racial
activities
in
this
state.
the
committee
shall
conduct
its
investigation
so
as
to
collect
evidence
and
information.
and
then
i
dropped
one
and
two
because
the
committee
chairman,
as
i
will
come
to,
dropped
one
and
two,
and
go
to
three
to
collect
information
determining
the
effect
which
integration
or
the
threat
of
integration
could
have
on
the
operation
of
the
public
schools
in
the
state
or
the
general
welfare
of
the
state
and
whether
the
loss
of
barratry,
champerty,
and
maintenance
are
being
violated
in
connection
therewith.
that
is
the
resolution
before
the
court.
now,
as
to
what
happens
under.
on
september
20,
1957,
mr.
scull,
the
petitioner
was
called
before
this
committee.
in
view
of
the
watkins
and
sweezy
cases,
his
counsel
wisely,
he
was
another
counsel,
counsel
wisely
suggested
that
he
asked
the
committee
what
the
question
under
inquiry
was.
at
page
73
of
the
record,
you
will
find
that
the
committee
chairman
responded
by
stating
what
was
in
the
statute.
it's
on
the
middle
of
page
73.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
73,
your
honor,
right
in
the
middle
there
chairman
thomson
states
what
the
question
under
inquiry
is
by
repeating
the
statute.
then
mr.
scull
has
asked,
“do
you
belong
to
the
fairfax
county
council
on
human
relation
a
distinguished
body?”
and
on
page
74
and
75,
he
gives
his
answer
which
is
a
statement
he
had
prepared
indicating
the
he
supported
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
he
had
a
right
of
free
speech
and
a
free
assembly
to
speak
for
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
to
assemble
with
others
who
felt
likewise
and
he
would
not
answer
these
questions
because
they
infringed
his
constitutional
rights.
he
was
then
asked
30
other
questions
making
a
total
of
31
to
all
of
which
answers
he
gave
the
statement.
now,
the
questions
--
20
of
the
questions
involved
did
--
this
organization
or
that
organization
or
this
person
or
that
person
use
your
box,
your
mailbox.
the
rest
of
the
questions
were
associations
with
organizations
and
whether
he
had
contributed
funds
for
our
organizational
support
of
these
cases
that
were
in
the
court.
despite
the
fact
that
no
answer
was
ever
given
to
mr.
scull's
statement,
the
committee
went
to
the
arlington
circuit
court
and
asked
for
an
order
directing
mr.
scull
to
answer
all
of
the
31
questions.
we
had
a
hearing
in
october
15th,
i
was
at
this
hearing.
we
had
a
hearing
on
october
15th
before
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county
to
determine
whether
mr.
scull
should
be
ordered
to
answer
these
31
questions.
the
only
witness
was
mr.
thompson,
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
all
he
did
was
to
say
here
is
the
record
and
then
i
was
allowed
to
cross-examine
and
these
six
things
came
out
during
the
course
of
the
cross-examination.
first
that
the
committee
had
no
rule,
second,
that
mr.
scull
had
been
called
because
of
a
brochure
entitled
“the
shocking
truth”
which
is
an
anonymous
brochure
about
which
the
committee
knew
nothing
and
which
is
on
page
84
of
the
record
but
it's
hard
to
handle
it,
we
do
not
tear
it
out.
i've
torn
my
own
out
because
it
was
very
hard
to
work
with.
third,
mr.
thompson
stated
that
his
investigation
was
being
used
because
it
was
devastating
to
the
naacp
would
bust
that
organization
wide
open
and
would
keep
the
naacp
out
of
litigation
which
was
the
heart
of
the
organization.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
are
on
page
34
and
35,
your
honor,
please
of
the
record.
he
also
conceded
about
--
well
this
was
a
racial
activity
investigating
committee
there
were
a
hundred
to
one
ratio
of
investigations,
a
hundred
of
people
connected
with
the
naacp
and
one
of
the
defenders
of
sovereignty
which
is
the
other
side
of
the
fight.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
in
implementing
his
desire
to
devastate
bust
and
break
the
naacp
they
had
called
a
hundred
witnesses
before
their
committee
who
were
in
some
way
connected
to
naacp
or
would
give
information
about
that
side
and
one
witness
on
the
other
side.
this
was
their
answer
to
the
claim
of
fairness
was
that
they
had
investigated
both
sides.
it
was
like
a
horse
and
a
rabbit.
it
was
100
people
on
the
one
side
and
one
on
the
other.
then
if,
your
honor
please
--
if
your
honor,
please
the
--
mr.
thomson
supports
rightly
and
confirm
the
fact
that
he
is
the
leading
supporter
of
segregated
schools
and
opponent
of
this
court's
decisions
in
his
area.
and
finally
at
the
sixth,
we
went
in
to
the
question
under
inquiry
and
mr.
thomson
was
--
and
i
will
develop
this
at
further
length
in
the
argument.
mr.
thomson
was
unable
in
anyway
to
state
a
question
under
inquiry
in
any
definitive
form.
despite
this
and
despite
that
failure
of
counsel
for
the
committee
ever
to
make
a
suggested
distinction
of
this
court's
decision
in
watkins
and
sweezy,
the
court
ordered
mr.
scull
to
answer
the
31
questions
before
the
committee.
mr.
scull
in
fact
before
the
committee
on
october
23rd
had
respectfully
declined
to
answer
on
his
statement.
on
october
30,
1957,
there
was
a
trial
which
consist
of
largely
of
argument
over
the
record.
mr.
scull
was
sentence
to
10
days
imprison
and
a
$50
fine.
we
file
petitions
for
writs
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
appeals
of
virginia
from
both
the
initial
order
to
answer
the
questions
and
from
the
sentence
in
order
to
protect
themselves
and
both
orders
were
both
petitions
for
writ
of
error
were
denied.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
saying
that
the
decisions
below
were
“claim
the
right
and
that
their
decision
in
effect
affirms
the
circuit
court
rulings.”
on
--
on
june
9th,
this
court
granted
certiorari
but
it
denied
our
request
for
a
summary
reversal.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
has
expired,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
it
affects
the
case.
it
has
expired
--
actually
what
has
happened
is
that
both
of
the
committees
that
were
set
up
as
part
of
massive
resistance
on
september
29th,
1956
expired
at
the
end
of
1957
or
towards
the
end
of
1957,
but
a
new
committee
has
been
set
up
to
carry
on
the
work
of
the
two
whenever
the
new
committee
in
an
existence.
but
this
committee
is
no
longer
in
existence
other
than
there
is
an
outstanding
convictions
of
petitioner
for
his
refusal
to
answer.
now
it
is
--
he
needs
to
state
the
rules
that
this
court
has
set
down
as
i
understand
them
for
the
investigating
committees
and
the
--
their
effect
on
--
in
the
first
amendment.
the
rule
seemed
simply
to
be
a
weighing
of
the
repressive
effect
of
summoning
and
compelling
a
witness
to
answer
against
the
interests
of
the
state
in
obtaining
the
information
which
those
answers
would
give.
and
as
i've
said
at
the
outset,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
there
is
less
--
that
there
is
a
greater
repressive
effect
and
a
less
interests
of
the
state
in
getting
this
information
than
in
any
case
presented
to
this
court.
the
repressive
effect
is
of
course
obvious.
here
is
a
main
question
about
associations
with
civic
religious,
political
organizations
fighting
for
a
civil
rights
in
an
atmosphere
of
better
local
hostility
to
the
principles
for
which
this
organization
stand.
indeed
i
suppose
on
this
side
of
the
case
naacp
versus
alabama
settle
the
matter
quite
clearly
the
repressive
effect
there.
this
court
unanimously
held
the
repressive
effect
involved
in
forcing
out
the
membership
list
of
an
organization
of
different
beliefs.
it's
worse
here
actually
because
you
have
not
a
single
organizational
tie
of
the
petitioner
at
which
this
committee
was
going,
but
all
of
these
organizational
ties
with
literally
a
dozen
organization
with
b'nai
b'rith,
american
friends
service
committee,
the
national
conference
of
christians
and
jews,
all
sorts
of
organizations
which
are
on
record
for
the
support
of
this
court's
decision
in
brown
and
which
are
thereby
subject
to
hostility
in
the
area
in
which
the
committee
operates.
but
it
might
be
said
well
these
are
respected
organization
who
doesn't
want
to
admit
he's
a
member
of
these
organizations
because
of
the
respect
in
which
they
are
held
by
thinking
people.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
even
the
most
respected
organization
one
is
entitled
to
freedom
of
association
with
them
not
that
i
--
not
that
i
need
to
rest
on
that
because
he
has
asked
on
organizations
which
have
real
hostility
this
court
knows
of
the
naacp
and
the
like
but
even
on
the
other
organizations.
the
ones
less
controversial
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
a
man
has
a
right
not
to
be
compelled
under
subpoena
to
answer
concerning
those
associations
because
in
a
sense
merely
being
subpoenaed
before
governmental
body
and
asked
about
them
results
in
the
idle
curiosity
of
the
general
public,
i
would
suggest,
the
suspicion
of
the
credulous
and
the
hatred
of
the
bigotry
no
one
it
seems
to
me
to
be
so
subjective.
now,
mr.
thomson
or
the
committee
wants
to
debate
in
the
public
prints
with
the
petitioner
and
they
want
to
take
the
position
that
this
court's
decision
is
wrong
and
petition
wants
to
take
of
the
position
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
good
old
american
way
but
for
mr.
thomson
to
use
his
subpoena
to
carry
on
this
debate
under
circumstances
where
there
are
no
fair
response
by
the
one
under
subpoena
is
a
wholly
different
situation.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
second
--
first
and
second,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
and
then
there
are
twenty
questions
later
on,
your
honor
about
the
use
of
his
box
number
by
those
organizations.
that
to
me
is
an
associational
question
then
we
did
the
b'nai
b'rith
to
use
your
box
number,
did
the
ada
use
your
box
number.
did
the
american
friends
use
your
box
number?
those
seemed
to
me
to
be
associational
questions
that
raised
the
issue
did
he
associate
with
these
organizations.
though
--
and
a
matter
of
fact,
the
box
number
is
the
bulk
of
the
questions.
there
are
twenty
out
of
the
thirty
one
there.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
we
come
to
the
other
half
of
the
equation
which
is
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
in
getting
this
information
down
here.
if
the
repressive
nature
is
clear
as
it
seems
to
be,
it
would
take
a
very
compelling
state
interest
to
offset
the
repressive
nature
of
the
questioning.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
come
--
i
can
either
answer
that
now
or
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
will
come
to
that
in
thirty
seconds
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
because
i
really
feel
that
questions
3
to
6
are
associational
in
the
sense
that
these
were
obviously
contributions
to
organizations
which
did
those
things
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
do
not
but
in
a
word,
i
will
say
that
when
i
got
at
the
question
under
inquiry,
mr.
thomson
stated
that
the
barratry
was
not
part
of
it.
that's
the
simple
answer
to
the
question.
now
looking
at
this
question
of
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state,
in
the
first
place
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
thompson
squarely
stated
at
page
20
of
the
record
that
he
had
called
mr.
scull
to
establish
whether
or
not
what
was
reported
in
there
that
is
in
this
anonymous
pamphlet,
the
shocking
truth
was
true.
in
other
words,
here
is
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
is
to
call
a
man
before
an
investigating
committee
to
ask
him
whether
this
document
the
shocking
truth
was
true
when
it
says
of
him
and
it
has
even
the
middle
with
the
post
office
box
and
it
has
lines
out
to
all
these
different
organizations.
that
was
the
compelling
interest
that
started
this
hearing.
then
at
page
29
of
the
record,
we
started
to
try
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
question
under
inquiry
was.
right
at
the
outset,
mr.
thomson
admits
that
what
he
was
really
trying
to
find
out
was
whether
in
fact
those
organizations
are
racial
in
character.
this
is
about
fifteen
lines
down,
your
honors
--
whether
in
fact
those
organizations
are
racial
in
character,
whether
at
a
future
time
the
legislature
might
wish
to
authorize
an
investigation
of
these
subjects.
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
mr.
thomson
then
i
will
respectfully
submit
it
is
not
easy.
if
i
understand
him,
he
was
saying
“i
wanted
to
know
whether
the
b'nai
b'rith,
the
ada,
the
aclu,
the
american
friends,
the
national
conference
of
christians
and
jews
were
racial
in
character.
by
this,
i
presume
he
meant
whether
they
were
interracial
in
character
because
he
so
suggested
later
on.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
page
29
if
your
honor
please,
about
the
--
two,
four,
six,
eight,
ten,
twelve,
the
thirteenth
line.
he
says
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
in
fact
those
organizations
are
racial
in
character
whether
at
a
future
time
the
legislature
might
want
to
do
something.
now
then
i
went
on
to
try
to
find
out
what
the
question
under
inquiry
really
was.
because
if
you
will
look
back
now,
your
honors
at
page
73
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
when
mr.
thomson
was
asked
at
the
initial
hearing
by
mr.
scull's
then
counsel,
“what
is
the
question
under
inquiry?”
he
answered
as
follows.
the
subject
under
inquiry
by
the
committee
mr.
scull
are
three-fold,
one,
several
which
primarily
do
not
deal
with
you
and
then
he
went
on
to
restate
the
statute.
so
when
i
cross-examined
him
and
this
is
on
page
29
of
the
record,
i
said,
“please
tell
us
which
of
these
three
namely
taxable
status,
threat
of
integration
or
barratry,
which
of
these
three
are
in
the
question
under
inquiry.
and
right
at
the
top
of
page
30,
mr.
thomson
says
flatly
“looking
at
it
in
--
this
is
the
third
line
on
page
30
--
looking
at
in
retrospect
the
other
on
champerty,
barratry,
and
maintenance
would
not
apply.”
in
other
words,
where
there
any
issue
if,
your
honor,
justice
frankfurter,
would
to
answer
your
question
now
if
i
may
that
the
chairman
of
the
committee
himself
took
the
barratry
out
of
it.
but
i
would
say
even
if
he
had
not,
there
would
have
been
no
further.
it
would
have
not
been
a
distinguishable
question
since
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
contribute
to
bringing
a
lawsuit
to
vindicate
the
constitutional
right
of
another
person.
if
he
did
not,
our
legal
aid
societies,
our
very
fabric
of
our
justice
is
based
on
help
to
the
indigent.
all
that
you
would
have
here
would
be
indigent
persons
who
needed
help
to
establish
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
afraid
that
i
cannot
help,
your
honor
on
what
that
means.
i
can
say
that
i
was
worried
i
didn't
understand
it
so
i
repeated
the
question
down
further
on
the
same
page
and
you
--
just
about
fifteen
lines
up
from
the
bottom
i
said,
“which
of
the
three
were
you
referring
to
when
you
said
several
which
primary
do
not
deal
with
you.
i
think
it
is
the
last
mentioned
there
that
would
be
the
barratry.
would
you
just
state
for
the
record
so
that
it's
clear
on
the
record
which
ones
you
were
referring
to
that
did
not
deal
with
mr.
scull.
the
violation
of
those
dealing
with
champerty,
barratry
and
maintenance
in
general
unauthorized
practice
of
the
law.”
in
other
words,
i
have
your
honor
the
same
fear
that
it
wasn't
clear
and
i
did
what
i
could
to
clarify.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
cannot
even
answer
that
question,
your
honor
because
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent
in
this
court.
it
is
not
mentioned.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
the
way
i
looked,
your
honor
that
he
is
saying
the
opposite.
it's
very
difficult
to
say.
i
--
i
think
of
justification
for
my
statement
that
the
committee
was
unable
to
state
a
question
under
inquiry.
i
think
one
could
interpret
that
last
sentence
as
your
honor
has
in
view
of
the
more
categorical
statement
the
other
way.
i
am
more
or
less
was
implying
to
credit
the
categorical
ones.
i
think
if
this
were
alone,
your
honors
interpretation
might
very
well
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
the
contrary,
my
judgment,
it
would
all
be
proper,
your
honor.
the
difference
here
is
that
this
is
not
an
investigation
that
the
difference
based
on
the
history
of
how
it
came
in,
it's
the
difference
based
on
the
questions
that
were
asked
if
the
difference
is
in
fact
a
serious
purpose
of
finding
a
solution
to
segregation
were
involved,
i
rather
doubt
that
that
it
would
be
done
by
investigating
in
a
hostile
fashion
under
subpoena.
but
even
if
it
were,
i
would
certainly
say
it
was
appropriate.
i
suggest
that
every
that
this
left,
that
this
record
literally
shrieked
with
an
answer
that
this
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
investigation
nor
do
any
of
the
questions
help
with
that
problem
but
that
this
in
fact
what
the
governor
asked
for
namely
the
ways
of
preventing
integration
and
that
this
is
in
fact
the
way
it
was
carried
out.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
afraid,
your
honor
that
i
would
disagree
that
that
was
correct
because
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
take
one
question
out
of
the
batch
not
that
i
think
there's
any
of
this
is
correct
but
i
would
say
i
do
not
feel
that
your
honors
could
isolate
one
question
here.
it
is
conceivable
had
a
special
answer
been
given
to
one
question.
had
the
committee
said
“well,
maybe
you
are
right
about
some
of
these
but
we
have
a
special
need
for
the
one
question
then
there
might
be
some
justification?”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
is
quite
clearly
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
certainly.
it
is
quite
clearly
both
if
your
honor,
please.
this
is
not
a
case.
this
is
clearly
a
case
where
the
history
of
this
inquiry
as
part
of
a
program
of
massive
resistance
is
invalid
and
it
is
also
a
case
where
the
operation
of
it
no
rules,
no
question
under
inquiry,
no
stated
purpose
for
the
legislation.
and
let
me
just
say
this,
make
this
perfectly
clear
in
those
time
in
this
entire
proceeding
before
the
committee,
before
the
lower
court,
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
in
the
brief
here
has
there
been
one
suggestion
of
one
piece
of
legislation
that
might
conceivably
come
from
the
questioning.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
say
in
answer
to
both
your
honor
and
justice
stewart
that
this
is
invalid
on
its
phase.
but
even
if
it
were
not
the
31
questions,
each
one
of
them
are
invalid
as
such.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
because
it
seems
to
me
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
situation
is
so
clear
here
that
it
is
a
matter
that
seems
to
me
in
my
client's
interest
to
suggest
both
have
of
this
proposition.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
both
are
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
might
not
want
to
choose
one
instead
of
the
other.
now,
i
repeat
what
i
said
before
that
at
no
stage
have
we
heard
a
legislative
purpose
such
as
the
first
legislative
purpose
i
have
heard
justice
james
and
justice
stewart
in
this
entire
proceeding
that
we
have
been
through.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
if
your
honor
please,
that
when
a
man
goes
before
a
committee
and
suggests
his
side
of
this
as
the
court
held
in
watkins,
the
time
has
come
for
the
committee
to
give
some
indication
of
its
side
of
the
situation
so
the
witness
may
judge
whether
to
answer
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor,
it
would
be
fair
to
limit
the
decision.
that's
a
matter
for
you
your
honors.
i
can
only
say
that
in
my
judgment,
this
is
bad
on
its
phase
in
addition
to
its
operation.
now,
may
i
just
add
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
equation
is
clear
here,
the
balance
of
the
repression
and
the
absence
of
a
compelling
interest.
but
there,
you
add
to
this
equation
what
you
do
not
have
and
say
the
internal
security
investigating.
you
add
to
this
equation
something
else.
you
add
the
clear
purpose
of
resisting
integration.
these
are
not
covered
motives
of
investigative.
i'm
not
suggesting
your
honors
look
into
some
motives
of
mr.
thomson.
i'm
suggesting
you
just
take
them
at
their
word.
the
governor
said
we're
going
to
do
this
to
stop
integration.
the
assembly
said
we're
going
to
do
this
to
stop
integration.
mr.
thomson
said
we're
going
to
do
this
to
stop
integration.
it's
simply
a
question.
it
--
it's
just
what
this
court
said
in
a
sense
in
cooper
against
aaron
just
last
month
which
this
court
said,
“the
constitutional
rights
of
children
are
not
to
be
discriminated
against
in
school
admission
on
grounds
of
race
or
color
declared
by
this
court
in
brown.
it
can
neither
be
nullified
openly
and
directly
by
state
legislatures
or
state
executive
or
judicial
official
that
are
nullified
indirectly
by
them
through
evasive
schemes.
it
seems
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
exactly
an
indirect.
it
was
proposed
as
an
indirect
nullification.
and
may
i
say
that
it
seems
to
me
there
is
this
difference
and
this
a
fortiori
from
the
other
cases,
the
internal
security
investigating
cases,
there
it
seems
to
me
in
the
anti-communist
cases.
the
end
sought
of
the
internal
security
may
well
be
found
and
this
court
has
been
concerned
with
it
because
the
means
to
the
end
appeared
to
violate
constitutional
rights
or
freedom
of
speech
in
assembly.
i
respectfully
submit
that
here,
both
the
means
and
the
end
are
tainted,
the
means,
the
infringement
of
constitutional
right
of
speech
and
assembly
in
the
end
to
prevent
integration
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision.
not
only
do
you
have
a
taint
here
from
the
end
as
well
as
the
means,
you
have
a
taint
from
the
procedures.
you
have
a
taint
from
calling
a
man
on
the
basis
of
an
anonymous
brochure.
you
have
a
taint
on
the
rules.
as
it's
shown
at
the
rec
--
here
in
the
record,
there
were
no
rules
published
for
this
committee.
there
are
only
two
rules
in
all
whether
there
was
a
quorum,
what
was
the
quorum
and
if
they
should
have
a
reporter.
here,
a
man
is
called
by
subpoena
on
the
basis
of
anonymous
brochure
in
front
of
a
committee
without
rules
and
not
given
a
satisfactory
answer
to
what
was
the
question
under
inquiry.
and
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
the
appendix
in
our
brief
which
points
out
that
this
is
now
the
practice
in
every
state
which
has
complete
massive
resistance
to
this
court's
decision.
in
other
words
we
are
not
presenting
here
lightly
a
problem,
when
i
took
such
a
broad
decision,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
not
lightly
done.
these
investigating
committees
now
appear
without
procedures
for
the
purpose
of
resisting
this
court's
decision
in
every
state
in
the
south
where
there
has
been
not
one
step
towards
integration.
we
are
presenting
here
therefore
a
problem
of
wide
application.
now
respondent's
brief
has
two
points
in
it
as
i
would
see
them.
first,
the
suggestion
that
we
did
not
raised
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
that
point,
this
is
on
page
1
as
an
implication
to
this
effect.
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
note
6
on
page
14
of
our
brief
in
which
we
point
out
a
dozen
places
in
which
we
did
raise
the
issue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
just
to
make
clear
that
we
did
it
at
the
outset,
i
would
call
your
honors
attention
to
page
75
of
the
record.
and
at
page
75
of
the
record,
mr.
scull
closes
his
statement,
his
opening
statement
for
all
of
the
foregoing
reasons
and
on
the
basis
of
all
the
rights
accorded
to
me
under
section
8,
11
and
12
of
the
constitution
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
correlative
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
are
respectfully
declined
to
answer.
section
12
of
article
1
of
the
constitution
of
virginia
is
a
free
speech
section.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
raises
the
point
tactfully
and
honorably
and
clearly
in
the
state
of
virginia
by
referring
to
its
constitutions
and
then
saying
the
correlative
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
only
other
point
made
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
is
that
these
were
preliminary
questions,
but
preliminary
to
what?
preliminary,
they
haven't
said,
preliminary
to
what
these
organizations
do.
this
is
a
matter
of
public
record.
how
could
we
measure?
we're
having
enough
trouble
finding
the
question
under
inquiry
in
order
to
measure
questions
that
were
asked.
how
could
you
measure
against
the
question
under
inquiry
question
who
haven't
even
been
asked
yet?
so,
i
don't
see
that
the
preliminary
issue
can
solve
the
respondent's
difficulty.
if
i
may
respond
to
your
question,
justice
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
you
--
i
believe
that
you
have
that
statute.
you
could
strike
that
down
on
the
broad
basis
namely
that
this
was
part
of
an
effort
to
prevent
integration
and
that
in
fact
they
passed
two
--
they
passed
three
barratry
statutes
the
same
day
outlawing
various
things
such
as
giving
of
assistance
to
people
in
lawsuits
and
these
are
presently
before
your
honors
on
a
statement
as
the
jurisdiction
coming
up
from
the
three-judge
court
which
held
those
statutes
were
unconstitutional,
but
--
so
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes
you
could,
but
you
don't
have
to
because
here,
the
anti-barratry
situation
was
first
written
out
of
the
case
by
mr.
thomson
who
said
it
was
not
part
of
the
question
under
inquiry
to
mr.
scull
and
it
is
in
addition
clear
that
mr.
scull
had
a
constitutional
right
to
do
the
things
that
they
asked
him
about
namely,
to
contribute
to
organizations
which
back
lawsuits
because
otherwise
your
entire
system
of
justice
as
mr.
scull
very
fairly
pointed
out
in
his
statement
would
--
would
collapse
the
whole
support
of
indigent
legal
right
is
based
on
contribution.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
certainly
not.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
of
course
they
would.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
your
honor
accused
me
of
broadening
the
case
before
which
i
do
in
the
sense
that
i
say
that
nothing
under
this
resolution,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
valid.
i
didn't
say
that
nothing
under
any
resolution
would
be
valid.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
of
course
it
can.
it
can
make
a
nondiscriminatory
fair
investigation
with
a
clear
statement
of
a
question
under
inquiry,
a
clear
set
of
rules,
calling
people
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
to
determine
how
litigation
is
financed.
such
a
resolution
would
certainly
be
appropriate
and
the
questioning
would
be
appropriate.
it
so
happened
that
we
have
neither
the
resolution
nor
the
operation
under
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
either
i
misunderstood
mr.
justice
harlan
or
you
misunderstood
me,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
[laughs]
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
i
support
the
proposition.
first,
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
to
use
the
words
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
used
before
and
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
his
operation
to
mr.
scull.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
well,
i'm
sure
i'm
glad
that
i'm
here
with
a
simpler
occasion
out
here,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
i
--
i
would
be
prepared
to
take
that
burden
and
maybe
someday
i
may
have
the
honor
to
return
and
try
to
win
that
case.
i
do
not
however
have
to
win
that
here.
it's
quite
clear.
well,
just
in
conclusion,
i
don't
want
to
take
this
court's
time
to
summarize
the
equation.
the
equation
is
quite
clear.
the
repressive
effect
is
clear.
the
justification
is
nil.
there
is
one
thing
i
would
like
to
say
in
conclusion.
and
that's
--
it's
--
it's
a
topsy-turvy
world
in
which
mr.
scull
is
ordered
to
jail
for
seeking
to
vindicate
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
he
sent
to
jail
at
the
behest
of
a
man
who
proudly
proclaims
that
he's
the
leading
opponent
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
one
might
think
calling
him
before
the
committee
under
compulsory
process
in
violating
his
constitutional
rights
would
give
him
a
remedy
in
another
forum.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
is
no
other
forum.
the
kenny
case
makes
clear
there
is
no
forum
under
the
civil
rights
act.
there's
no
forum
at
the
electorate,
if
your
honors
please,
in
a
tense
situation
such
as
created
by
the
--
your
honors
decision.
the
only
forum
for
vindication
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
this
petitioner,
the
constitutional
right
to
publicly
proclaim
and
help
carry
out
the
decisions
of
this
court
lies
in
a
vindication
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
have
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
there
are
just
two
facts
of
statement
that
i
would
like
to
call
your
--
two
record
references
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
attention.
at
the
bottom
of
page
29,
the
tax
exemption
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
of
the
record,
your
honor.
the
tax
exemption
about
which
there's
been
so
much
discussion
is
squarely
ruled
out
of
the
question
under
inquiry,
that
the
last
answer,
“this
is
mr.
thomson.
and
i
am
asking
mr.
thomson
what
did
he
mean
when
he
said
several
did
not
apply?”
and
he
said,
“from
my
personal
standpoint,
i
would
say
that
the
one
dealing
with
the
taxable
status
does
not
affect
him
here.
the
taxable
status
was
clearly
outside
of
the
case.”
secondly,
and
i
think
there's
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
under
sweezy,
if
your
honor
please,
that's
exactly
the
vice
that
was
created
there
is
that
there
is
no
clear
channel
of
what
the
legislature
and
then
the
committee
wants.
now,
the
only
other
facts
of
question
i
have
is
--
the
factual
answer
i
have
is
the
question
was
raised
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
not
his
client,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
had
--
i've
only
picked
it
up
by
ear
too.maybe
it
--
may
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
[laughter]
with
such
expertise,
i
will
not
make
the
mistake
again.
the
fairfax
county
council
on
human
relations
as
to
which
a
question
was
asked,
“was
there
anything
in
the
record
on
the
fairfax
county
on
human
relations?”
in
this
leaflet
“the
shocking
truth!”
which
is
in
the
record,
there
is
a
page
which
is
apparently
an
invitation
to
join
the
fairfax
county
on
human
relations.
it
seems
to
have
a
very
distinguished
officer
and
directorship.
and
in
addition,
the
only
factual
thing
it
says
about
it
affiliated
with
the
virginia
council
on
human
relations
and
the
southern
regional
council
both
as
i
understand
is
very
distinguished
organizations
in
the
field
of
relations.
i
have
no
further
--
