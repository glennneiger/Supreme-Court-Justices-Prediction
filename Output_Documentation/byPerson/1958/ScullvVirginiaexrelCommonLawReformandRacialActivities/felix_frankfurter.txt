justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on
then,
mr.
rauh,
you
haven't
said
anything
unless
i
had
seemed
to
(inaudible)
about
the
barratry
aspects
of
the
person.
i
don't
mean
the
discussion
of
it
but
some
of
the
questions
are
directed
not
in
association
of
activities
but
the
barratry.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suit
yourself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
my
questions.
i
wonder
whether
you
differentiate
between
the
questions
which
i
have
a
barratry
of
aspect
but
maybe
barratry
with
associational
innuendos.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
appendix.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that
(inaudible)
sentence
mean?
is
it
specifically
with
the
third?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
to
say
first
the
barratry
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
presided
the
question
before
us,
the
validity
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
besides
the
31
questions
--
and
i
suppose
if
that
--
am
i
right
or
wrong
in
assuming
that
if
any
of
the
questions
are
sustainable,
that
takes
care
of
the
sentence.
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
take
your
time
to
argue
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
right
off
to
that,
that
if
31
questions
are
asked
and
29
of
them
were
invalidly
asked,
that
still
covers
the
two
that's
standing
by
themselves
would
be
otherwise
but
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
i
wanted
to
--
i'm
just
telling
you
myself
you
can
do
it
with
what
you
please
but
the
time
is
yours
i
suppose.
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
your
trust
is
directed
against
the
validity
of
the
questions
or
does
it
go
beyond
to
some
underlying
invalidity
of
that
which
authorize
the
asking
of
the
question,
they're
all
to
me
not
very
attractive
bearing
honest
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
bearing
on
its
base
problem
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
taking
on
the
heavy
burden
namely
that
none
of
the
legislatives
regarded
all
as
a
whole
and
that
none
of
it
maybe
used
for
the
purposes
indicated
by
the
mr.
stewart's
question
or
the
validity
of
such
an
inquiry
you
acceded
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
claim
on
this.
(inaudible)
i
don't
know
why
you
should
carry
more
burden
as
you
need
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
respect
your
duty
but
also
mine
not
to
go
beyond
the
necessities
of
constitutional
adjudication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
legislature
leads
--
allowed
it's
purpose.
it's
nevertheless
it's
valid
or
a
valid
attribution
can
be
made
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
watkins
didn't
declare
that
the,
they
just
knock
out
the
whole
legislation
simply
in
further
in
light
of
it
those
questions
can't
be
asked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
really
think
that
our
recognition
of
the
need
of
legal
assistant,
that
indigent
litigants
impliedly
repeated
all
renders
unconstitutional
on
barratry
statutes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
the
state
in
making
inquiry
into
the
manner
and
methods
by
which
the
interest
of
the
indigent
defendant
should
be
taken
care
of
not
by
the
state
rather
than
meeting
at
the
private
organizations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
would
you
shut
off
all
the
inquiry
into
what
used
it.
but
the
long
story
--
story
of
barratry
by
saying
indigent
defendant
must
have
legal
aide.
that
doesn't
settle
the
problem
of
who,
how,
and
what
different
statutes
that
they
should
be
giving.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
be
your
hypothetical
statute
namely
plain
barratry
statute
and
they
want
to
find
out
how
litigation
is
financed.
and
you
think
the
state
has
no
power
because
that
may
or
even
if
you
please
--
is
motivated
by
finding
out.
and
if
you
please,
even
if
i'm
convinced
as
i
might
easily
be
convinced,
i
can
assure
you
that
it's
intended
to
put
those
naacp
that
it
can't
make
such
an
inquiry
into
the
most
of
average
litigation
and
finance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that,
but
the
questions
don't
meet
those
conditions.
but
this
notion
you're
talking
about
legal
aide
society,
therefore
no
barratry
investigation
is
a
little
--
and
even
broad
and
even
more
inviting
in
your
broad
shoulder
of
that
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
so
long
as
we
end
up
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
the
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
a
man
claims
that
the
questions
that
are
asked
of
him
may
not
constitutionally
behalf
even
to
hiding
because
he
doesn't
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
actually
recall
officers
of
these
organizations?
how
many
of
these
organizations
about
that
you
inquired
have
been
localized
or
incorporated
the
virginia
or
authorized
to
the
witness
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
authorized
to
do
business
in
any
formal
way
in
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
--
when
you
call
attention
to
the
formulation
of
the
two
subject
matters
in
the
subpoena
problems
relating
to
integration
and
problems
relating
to
barratry
control
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assume
that
one
takes
that
in
face
value
but
may
not
the
chairman
of
the
committee
disavow
inquiry
abstracted
formulating
the
subpoena
and
say,
“i'm
not
asking
you
about
these
things
or
what
i'm
asking
you
is
not
related
to
this
document?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
do
that,
may
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
record?
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
--
at
--
does
all
of
them
--
one
of
the
questions
whichever
way
you
look
at
it,
certainly
we
have
before
us
the
demand,
the
compulsory
requirement
to
answer
this
question,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
compulsion
was
exerted
by
the
court
and
not
by
the
committee
because
the
committee
as
i
understand
it
can
say
“you
answer,
you
go
to
jail.
you
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
go
to
a
court
and
get
an
order.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
taking
to
--
taking
at
face
value
of
what
you
exerted
on
page
73,
what
chairman
thomson
said
to
mr.
finelli,
the
--
the
bite
of
the
thing
is
when
you
get
into
court
and
asked
the
court
to
enforce
answer.
and
therefore
if
mr.
thomson
there
changes
position
and
told
the
court,
“we're
not
concerned
with
barratry,”
then
the
case
comes
to
us,
puts
that
in
that
context
and
with
that
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposed
that's
true,
that
would
be
so
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
record
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
did
connect
the
question
right
after
that
before.
or
that
is
correct.
next
question.
now,
is
it
also
correct
that
you
said
several
which
primarily
do
not
deal
with
you
as
you
do
not,
so
as
to
grant
the
service
(inaudible)
said
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
of
those
three
were
you
referring
to
when
you
said
(inaudible)
primarily
do
not
deal
with
you.
i
suppose
“to
you”
as
scull.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
was
interrupted,
but
i
thought
that
interconnected
party
is
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unfortunately,
we
were
not
been
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
translate
that,
would
you?
the
one
spoken
of
the
--
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
but
we
got
to
judge
the
matter
on
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
does
the
record
show
without
dispute
what
the
fairfax
committee
on
human
relations
been
to
what
was
in
security
and
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
all
we
know,
it
might
be
acquired
of
anything
as
a
matter
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you
will
deal
what
mr.
raugh
said
that
his
duty
to
his
client
to
consider
the
questions
not
nearly
an
isolated
inquiry
but
as
part
and
parcel
related,
legally
related
to
a
body
of
enactment
or
directed
toward
a
given
purpose,
and
the
question
in
the
resolution
and
the
statute
must
all
be
dealt
with
as
an
organic
(inaudible)
to
understand
his
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
any
views
on
that?
if
you
have,
i
for
one
would
like
to
hear
them
or
you
sit
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
can't
we
take
judicial
notice
of
the
enactments
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that,
do
we
have
to
go
to
periodicals
or
the
evanescence
daily
newspaper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
hall,
really
--
not
--
not
the
washington
post,
but
i'd
like
to
be
informed
if
you
think
that
enactment
of
a
state
and
the
official
either
message
written
by
failure
already
communicated
message
of
the
governor
sponsoring
legislation
may
not
be
taken
judicial
notice
of
by
this
court
assuming
it's
relevant
--
assuming
the
man
is
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
not
--
can't
we
look
assuming
it's
relevant
--
and
i'm
making
that
assumption
as
an
assumption.
assuming
it's
relevant,
may
not
this
court
--
i
ask
again,
go
to
the
enactment
of
a
state
without
any
proof
of
the
enactments
in
the
records.
and
further,
go
to
the
statements
of
the
governor
in
sponsoring
legislation
elucidating
their
meaning,
setting
forth
their
interconnection,
defining
their
purposes,
may
not
this
court
take
judicial
notice
of
such
official
acts
by
governors
and
legislatures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
you
--
you
do
not
find
the
poison
in
it
that
mr.
raugh
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
can
understand
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
then
the
fact
that
they're
enacted
the
same
day
doesn't
necessarily
prove
that
they're
connected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
exclude
that
they
may
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
we
determine
whether
it's
one
or
the
other
except
through
the
enlightenment
we
get
from
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
accept
that.
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hall,
if
i
may
pursue
the
chief
justice's
line
of
inquiry,
aren't
you
--
on
the
one
hand,
you
object
to
stretching
the
right
in
the
case
of
the
naacp
decision,
but
aren't
you
narrowing
it
beyond
its
essential
significance
or
isn't
that
the
core
of
that
case,
the
right
of
constitution
--
the
constitutional
protection
of
the
right
of
people
to
foregather
and
associate
themselves
for
purposes
that
are
not
outlawed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
that
--
if
that's
the
core
meaning
of
that
case,
the
people
have
a
right
to
get
together
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
people
have
a
right
to
associate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
have
a
right
to
formulate
their
ways
of
promoting,
solicit
for
lawful
purposes.
now,
if
that's
the
core
of
that
decision,
i'm
not
forcing
to
state
the
(inaudible)
of
the
opinion
but
if
that's
the
essence
of
it
and
isn't
that
they
need
the
same
inhibiting
effect
or
(inaudible)
by
asking
not
the
officers,
but
individual
members.
if
one
person
after
another
is
summoned,
he
ask
whether
he's
a
member
of
the
naacp
was
potentially
disastrous
or
disadvantageous
consequences,
which
you
agreed
might
ensue
and
isn't
the
same,
isn't
that
right
impaired
seriously
there?
these
people
have
to
go
through
all
this
business.
the
likelihood
of
people
not
joining
the
naacp
is
very
considerable,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
understand
your
position.
if
--
if
i
may
translate
it
to
the
concrete.
i
can
well
understand
that
virginia
or
any
other
state
may
withdraw
tax
exemptions
from
non-commercial
enterprise.
i
could
well
understand
that
you
may
consider
that
and
therefore
may
call
officers
or
even
members
in
order
to
find
out
whether
that
particular
so-called
charitable
organization
is
pursuing
that
charitable
purpose
or
doing
something
else,
is
holding
a
lot
of
fairs
and
selling
(inaudible)
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
i
can
understand
that
if
--
if
you've
got
a
record
that
establishes
that.
virginia
may
ascertain
whether
or
not
you
should
withdraw
tax
exemptions
from
all
charitable
organizations,
make
everybody
pay.
but
is
the
record
here
is
susceptible
of
being
put
under
that
kind
of
a
justification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
we
--
what
we
have
and
the
only
thing
we
can
consider
is
what
i
call
the
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
business.
now,
within
those
two
grounds
covered,
is
there
anything
that
--
that
brings
this
record
under
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
am
so
badly
sketched?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
abstractly
whether
they
were
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
and
it
may
well
be
that
if
--
i'm
not
saying
you
might
not
have
pursue
inquiry
and
put
some
more
questions
directed
toward
showing
that
really
what
you
are
after
is
to
find
out
whether
tax
exemption
should
be
withdrawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
[laughter]
i
don't
object
that
you're
going
outside
of
it
but
not
for
any
purpose
relevant
to
my
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
have
that
but
the
record
may
not
show
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you
it's
“sweet”.
