would
that
--
would
that
be
any
reason
for
asking
him
in
connection
with
what
you
are
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
would
his
membership
have
to
do
with
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
possibly
hurt
him
on
the
(inaudible)
with
me
to
see
i
possibly
had
you
cause
by
what
--
who
belonged
to
an
organization
assuming
if
you
said
that's
a
perfectly
read
organization,
legitimate
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
preliminary
questions,
but
if
they
have
no
relevance
here
in
the
connection
of
the
thing,
what
relevance
his
membership
has
to
what
you
are
really
trying
to
find
out
of
what
on
either
phase
of
your
inquiry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
relevance
that
his
membership
or
non-membership
he
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
could
have
asked
him
what
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
we
know,
he
might
have
known
all
about
what
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
simply
didn't
answer
whether
he
was
a
member
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
--
was
any
purpose
of
the
investigation
to
pass
a
law
making
it
unlawful
then
belong
to
this
organization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we've
got
to
look
at
these
ambiguous
statements
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
asked
whether
the
b'nai
b'rith
used
his
post
office
box
number.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
would
be
making
a
contribution,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wouldn't
be
a
contribution
wasn't
it
if
it
were
for
the
b'nai
b'rith
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
americans
or
democratic
action
to
use
his
box,
i
suppose
that
could
be
some
contribution
that
he
paid
for
the
box,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
ask
more
than
“are
you
a
member
of
the
fairfax
county
council
of
human
relations?”
didn't
he?
and
the
very
next
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
stated
in
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
he
not
be
injured
by
answering
whether
he's
a
member
of
the
national
association
of
the
advancement
of
colored
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
he
couldn't
be
asked
you
if
he
might
not
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
then
you
wouldn't
say
it
that
he
couldn't
be
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
arguing
with
you
but
you
said
that
he
couldn't
be
and
i
just
asked
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you're
quoting
from
the
brief
--
