chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hall,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this.
you
said
that
you
conceded
under
our
naacp
case
last
year
that
you
had
no
right
to
ask
for
the
membership
list
of
that
organization.
i
ask
if
--
because
it
would
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
members.
now
i
ask
you
if
there
is
any
constitutional
difference
between
asking
the
organization
for
its
membership
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand,
asking
everybody
you
suspect
to
belonging
to
that
organization
if
he
belongs
to
it.
and
if
he
will
not
answer,
put
him
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
that
--
that
applied
--
of
course,
that
case
applied
only
to
the
request
of
the
naacp
for
its
membership
list
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
that
was
not
to
--
to
protect
the
corporation.
that
was
to
protect
the
rights
of
--
of
the
individuals,
was
it
not
who
belong
to
naacp
and
their
right
of
association.
now,
i
--
i
ask
you
the
question.
if
it
--
if
that
violated
their
rights,
why
wouldn't
bring
them
in
as
individuals
and
compelling
them
to
say
under
oath
that
they
belong
or
did
not
belong
to
that
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
stretching
it.
i'm
just
asking
you
if
there
is
a
different
constitutional
principle
involved.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
--
i
just
like
to
have
you
state
it,
if
you
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
punishment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rauh,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well.
