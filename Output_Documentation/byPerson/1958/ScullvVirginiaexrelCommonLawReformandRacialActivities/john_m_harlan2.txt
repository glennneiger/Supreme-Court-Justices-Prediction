where
in
the
record
is
given?
justice
john
m.
harlan

think
i
understood
what
you
just
stated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
rauh,
is
this
committee
a
functus
officio?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that
it
doesn't
affect
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
i
misread
these
questions.
i'm
looking
at
the
appendix
a
of
your
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
glanced
over
them,
i
don't
see
that
he
was
asked
any
questions
as
to
his
membership
in
any
of
these
organizations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
other
than
the
fairfax
county
council
and
the
naacp.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
rauh,
right
bottom
of
page

opposite

ask
you
one
question?
supposing
(inaudible)

“we
want
to
find
out
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
but
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
(inaudible)
brought
us
with
your
position,
striking
down
the
statute
as
distinguished
from
its
application
to
this
--
to
this
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
mean
that
at
this
record,
this
man
had
come
before
the
committee
and
simply
said,
“well,
this
--
i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
question.
that's
all
there
was.”
and
you
hear
arguments
statute
that
you
talked
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
usual
requirements
that
they
use
in
this
investigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
you
(inaudible)
signed
a
little
later
by
mr.
thomson
in
that
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
governor's
statement
that
is
quoted
on
page
8?
the
chairman
was
referring
to
the
decision
of
the
court
here.
and
because
of
the
answer
i've
just
mentioned
that
i
come
to
you
before
you
today
that
the
purpose
is
submitting
recommendations
to
continue
our
system
of
segregated
public
schools.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
can't
we
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
that
you
you're
claiming
you
can't
properly
take
this
into
consideration?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
can't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
all
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
ultimate
issue
on
this
case
is
like
the
case
that
we've
had
before
--
preceding
it.this
is
a
balancing
process.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
if
this
record
shows
on
the
one
hand
that
the
--
under
the
naacp
case
last
year
that
the
individual
interest,
constitutional
interest,
rights
of
this
witness
are
involved
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
fails
to
show
a
--
adequately
what
the
state's
superseding
interest
is,
what
--
what
can
we
do
with
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
stand
on
that,
don't
you?
i
mean,
that's
your
ultimate
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
state's
interest,
overriding
interest,
is
sufficiently
shown
by
this
record
attested
by
the
inquiry.
that
--
that's
your
--
that's
the
single
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
