mr.
robert
h.
malis
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
third
circuit.
the
sole
question
with
the
consideration
of
this
court,
whether
the
recoveries
provided
under
section
26
(b)
(1)
of
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944,
constitute
a
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture
within
the
meaning
of
section
2462
of
title
28,
the
civil
statute
of
limitation.
this
action
was
commenced
on
may
12,
1955
and
sought
recovery
by
the
government
of
the
sum
of
$2000
plus
double
whatever
actual
damage
was
provable
against
two
veterans
who
were
alleged
to
have
given
false
statements
to
the
government
in
connection
with
the
application
and
the
obtaining
of
used
--
surplus
trucks.
these
events
occurred
in
1945
and
the
last
one
in
1946,
almost
nine
years
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
civil
act
--
civil
action
of
it,
pardon
me.
meanwhile,
in
1950,
these
defendants
were
indicted
and
pleaded
guilty
and
were
fined.
the
question
raised
at
the
time
of
institution
of
the
civil
action
is
whether
2462
which
requires
the
institution
of
suit
within
five
years
from
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
offenses
is
bar
to
the
civil
action
instituted
almost
nine
years
after
it
occurred
and
an
additional
five
years
after
indictment.
the
defendants
resisted
throughout
but
the
district
court
speaking
to
judge
(inaudible)
felt,
as
he
stated
in
his
opinion
reluctantly
constrained
to
find,
that
rex
trailer,
the
opinion
having
just
come
down
from
this
court
a
short
while
before,
sufficiently
indicated
that
the
provisions
of
26
(b)
(1)
of
the
surplus
property
act,
did
not
constitute
any
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture
within
the
meaning
of
that
act.
on
appeal,
of
course,
the
same
defense
was
raised
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
decided
this
case,
i
believe
squarely,
on
the
authority
of
rex
trailer.
it
is
our
position
and
we
would
like
to
urge
upon
the
court
that
rex
trailer
does
not
constitute
authority
for
the
position
which
many
of
the
judges
in
reading
it
have
extended
it
to
--
as
in
this
case.
may
i
point
out
first
the
language
of
the
statute
which
is
so
critical
and
which
we
must
interpret
here
in
order
to
make
a
decision,
26(b)
(1)
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
i
beg
you
--
it's
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
if
it
please
the
court
and
directing
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
to
the
paragraph
near
the
bottom
of
the
page
beginning
with
one,
parenthesis
one
shall
pay
to
the
united
states
the
sum
of
$2000
for
each
such
act,
and
double
the
amount
of
any
damage
which
the
united
states
may
have
sustained
by
reason
thereof
together
with
the
cost
of
suit
or
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
it
is
the
same
provision.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
but
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
exactly
the
same
provision
of
the
statute
sir,
however,
the
defense
was
entirely
different.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
double
jeopardy
in
rex
trailer
as
opposed
to
limitations
here.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
i'm
reading
from
page
2,
if
it
please,
at
the
bottom.
now,
the
second
section,
number
two,
shall
--
if
the
united
states
shall
so
allege,
pay
to
the
united
states
as
liquidated
damages
a
sum
equal
to
the
price
of
consideration,
agreed
to
be
given
by
the
united
states
or
any
federal
agency
to
such
person
or
by
such
person
to
the
united
states
of
any
federal
agency
as
the
case
maybe
or,
and
then
the
third
section
which
appear
on
the
top
of
page
3,
but
which
in
essence
is
identical
to
two,
containing
as
well
the
language
as
liquidated
damages.
now,
these
three
provisions
for
recovery
of
money
by
the
government
are
the
provisions
which
we
discussed
in
rex
trailer,
and
are
likewise
identical
to
except
for
one
or
two
words,
all
the
provisions
which
appear
in
the
contract
settlement
act
and
in
the
false
claims
act.
the
distinction
which
we
urge
upon
the
court,
differentiates
between
26
(b)
(1)
and
between
26
(b)
(2)
and
(3)
which
have
a
more
similar
importance.
that
distinction,
as
we
feel,
urged
by
several
statements
of
the
congress
and
also
by
the
very
language
employed
in
act
itself.
when
we
examined
the
statute
and
i
note
that
in
my
brief,
the
title
of
the
section
involved
does
not
appear,
but
in
the
statute
at
large
and
also
in
the
united
states
code,
this
section
bears
a
title,
civil
remedies
and
penalties.
unfortunately,
it
does
not
appear
in
as
much
as
the
statute
had
been
exerted
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument.
the
title
is
indicative,
we
feel,
of
congressional
understanding
that
somewhere
in
this
section,
if
there
is
a
reference
to
the
penalty,
there
is
a
provision
for
penalty
included
otherwise
the
title
should
not
have
said,
and
would
not
have
said,
civil
remedies
and
penalties
as
the
title
of
26
(b).
secondly,
there
is
need
for
differentiating
between
(b)
(1)
and
(b)
(2)
and
(3),
because
in
(2)
and
(3)
the
congress
has
taken
the
trouble
to
expressly
state
that
the
recoveries
of
those
two
sections
shall
be
considered
liquidated
damages,
whereas
in
26
(b)
(1)
that
language
is
missing.
now,
ordinarily
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
with
long
standing,
ordinarily,
if
the
congress
omits
critical
language
in
one
paragraph
which
it
includes
and
rather
shall
i
say
definite
fashion
parenthetically
and
separating
that
phrase
in
the
middle
of
this
provision
for
recovery
if
they
go
to
the
trouble
to
include
it
in
two,
but
omit
it
in
one,
ordinary
rules
of
construction
would
argue
that
we
who
sit
to
construe
the
statute
may
not
thereafter
ignore
what
the
congress
has
omitted
or
put
in
as
the
case
maybe
to
arrive
at
a
unification
of
the
interpretation
of
this
three
different
provisions.
we
feel
and
we
urge
strongly
that
this
section
26
(b)
(1)
is
different
from
26
(b)
(2)
and
(3)
aside
from
the
legalistic
effect
which
we
can
discuss
shortly
but
as
--
but
in
the
language
itself,
it
is
clearly
indicative
of
congressional
understanding
that
there
is
a
difference,
that
26
(2)
and
(3)
have
been
turned
to
be
liquidated
damages.
the
26
(b)
(1)
is
not
so
termed
and
in
addition,
violates
what
i
would
consider
a
basic
fundamental
of
liquidated
damages
that
is
that
if
a
specific
sum,
the
$2000
he
reserved
were
to
be
considered
liquidated
damages,
then
the
provision
for
double
the
amount
in
addition
of
any
actual
damage
which
of
course
has
to
be
proved.
its
provable
damage
requires
evidence.
you
have
destroyed
the
concept
of
a
liquidated
damage
provision,
such
a
concept
substitutes
for
the
proof
of
actual
damage
or
future
--
looking
to
the
future
for
damage,
the
agreed
figure
in
which
case
here,
the
congress
might
have
legislated
$2000
and
he
said
no
more.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
if
it
please
the
court.
it
cannot
be
on
any
other
theory
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
--
that
i
know
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
--
the
government
can
prevail
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
--
unless
this
$2000
may
be
deem
to
be
liquidated
damages.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
it
certainly
bears
no
direct
relationship
to
any
other
aspects
of
the
case,
it
is
not
required
or
susceptible
of
proof
and
must
therefore
be
either
liquidated
damages
or
penalty.
i
think
this
is
--
the
problem
that
the
government
must
overcome
in
order
to
destroy
the
effect
of
2462
on
these
provisions,
they
must
be
able
to
satisfy
the
court
that
this
is
liquidated
damages.
now,
let's
look
into
an
interesting
thing
that
is
not
in
the
brief
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
it
for
that
reason.
the
suspension
section
that
is
alluded
to
in
the
government's
brief
and
in
mine
rather
briefly,
was
enacted
in
1942.
in
1944
--
by
the
way,
the
language
at
that
time
was
that
this
suspension
section,
suspended
the
operation
of
limitations
of
actions
and
so
on
to
all
offenses
indictable,
all
offenses
indictable
under
the
various
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
this
was
enacted
to
save
the
--
the
tolling
of
the
statute
on
criminal
cases
until
three
years
after
the
end
of
hostility.
in
1944
within
a
month
or
so
of
the
adoption
and
the
enactment
of
the
surplus
property
act,
the
contract
settlement
act,
was
passed
by
the
congress
and
in
that
contact
settlement
act
case,
they
amended
the
suspension
section.
the
suspension
of
limitation
section
was
thereby
amended,
deleting
from
its
provision
the
applicability
to
offenses
indictable
under.
that
language
was
removed
and
it
then
referred
to
acts,
offenses
and
transactions.
now,
the
contract
settlement
act
was
specifically
made
subject
to
this
suspension
of
the
statute
of
limitations
by
the
act
in
1944.
within
two
months,
along
comes
the
congress
and
they
enact
the
surplus
property
act.
and
in
that
act,
section
28,
follows
the
section
under
a
consideration
here,
they
lie
in
just
a
position
to
each
other
on
the
page
of
the
statue
at
large,
26
(b)
(1)
and
28.
and
in
28,
they
again,
amend
the
suspension
of
limitation
section
to
include
specifically
the
provisions
of
the
surplus
property
act,
and
they
relate
to
that,
and
they
--
the
critical
thing
about
is
that
this
suspension
section
being
applicable
since
1944
to
the
contract
settlement
act
and
to
offenses
transactions
as
opposed
to
indictments.
now,
it's
clearly
applicable
to
a
suit
under
the
surplus
property
act,
but
what
do
we
find?
there
is
no
criminal
provision
at
all
in
the
surplus
property
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
veterans
were
indicated
under
an
entirely
different
statute
with
the
filing
of
a
false
certificate.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
section
28
as
amended
--
as
amended
is
before
you
in
the
government's
brief
and
in
a
footnote
in
my
briefs
are
near
at
the
end,
but
the
reason
i
emphasize
this
in
such
detail
is
that
the
prior
section
--
section
which
appeared
in
1942
has
not
been
reproduced
in
either
brief
or
the
record
in
either
place.
this
was,
i
think,
an
omission
which
could
have
been
explained,
because
it
shows
clearly,
congressional
understanding
and
intent
to
apply
suspension
of
limitations
to
the
surplus
property
act
in
which
it
was
enacted
and
not
merely
as
the
government
has
sought
to
induce
this
court
to
believe,
not
merely
to
criminal
cases.
and
the
proof
of
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
there
is
no
criminal
provision
whatever
in
the
surplus
property
act.
these
indictments
fell
solely
under
the
false
statement
act
which
is
title
18,
section
80
and
now
1001.
now,
i
would
like
--
my
time
--
i
don't
know
when
i
begun
unfortunately.
i
think
i
have
a
few
minutes
left.
i
would
like
to
point
out
an
important
argument
which
i
think
will
clarify
the
problem
which
has
arisen
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
rex
trailer.
in
the
hundred
odd
years
that
the
false
claims
act
has
been
in
the
courts,
down
to
the
present
time,
there
have
been
many,
many
decisions
relating
to
the
various
provisions
which
are
identical
to
of
course,
with
the
exception
of
the
word
for
forfeit
being
removed
or
missing
from
the
surplus
property
act,
but
in
--
for
all
intention
purposes,
this
court
in
rex
trailer
decided
that
those
provisions
were
the
same.
down
through
the
years,
the
judges,
the
justices
and
all
the
supreme
courts
of
the
land
as
well
as
the
united
states
supreme
court
have
consistently
referred
to
this
provision
as
a
forfeiture
time
and
time
and
time
again.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
recently
as
1959,
mr.
justice
black
in
--
mentioned
in
(inaudible),
used
the
language
as
we
use
a
pencil
and
a
pen
with
the
familiarity
of
everyday
expression,
from
every
decision
in
1863
going
down
until
even
mentioned
(inaudible),
that
$2000
which
is
$2000
all
by
itself,
plus
all
other
legal
damage
has
been
referred
to
us
the
forfeiture.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
section
2461
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1948,
they
were
referring
at
that
time
2461
is
the
immediate
antecedent
in
the
code
and
it
provides
for
the
institution
and
collection
of
civil
fines,
penalties
and
forfeitures
by
a
civil
action.
and
they
referred
to
in
that
legislative
history,
they
referred
to
the
decision
in
marcus
versus
hess,
in
which
under
consideration
was
the
same
provision
in
the
false
claims
act.
in
other
words,
we
lawyers,
the
judges,
the
justices
throughout
our
land
have
for
a
hundred
years
refer
to
this
$2000
stipend
as
a
forfeiture.
i
think
in
my
brief,
i
mentioned
a
case
in
third
circuit,
u.s.
versus
roller,
where
in
19
times,
in
one
opinion
judge
mclaughlin
classified
that
$2000
as
a
forfeiture.
now,
i
urge
this
court
respectfully
that
if
we,
the
judges,
the
justices
and
the
lawyers
call
this
thing
$2000
dollars
a
stipend
a
forfeiture
and
the
congress
legislates,
reading
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
referring
even
in
the
case
of
rex
trailer,
marcus
and
hess
--
they
refer
to
this
opinions
and
they
say,
they
should
for
a
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture
may
be
brought
within
five
years.
it
is
not
within
our
promise
to
go
back
to
huntington
and
attrill
or
helvering
and
mitchell
to
see
whether
legalistically
we
may
find
a
differentiation
and
i
submit
to
you
sirs
that
there
are
many
between
the
$2000
figure
which
has
no
relationship
or
there's
no
fraction
or
multiple
of
any
actual
damage.
but
we
need
not
to
do
that
where
if
the
congress
uses
the
language
that
the
courts
used
then
it
should
be
interpretive
in
that
way.
now,
rex
trailer
had
before
it
a
question
of
double
jeopardy.
there
is
no
part
in
their
saying
--
in
fact
the
courts
have
to
the
contrary
that
civil
sanctions
exists.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
may
i,
mr.
justice
stewart,
perhaps
more
actively
answer
your
question,
56
stat.
747
is
the
citation
of
the
original
suspension
section
enacted
in
1942.
in
58
stat.649,
this
was
enacted
july
1st,
1944.
certain
important
language
was
changed.
the
earlier
statute
clearly
was
a
criminal
suspension
act.
it
applied
to
offenses
indictable
under
the
law.
it's
so
stated
when
two
years
later
in
july
1st,
1944,
the
contract
settlement
act
in
the
law,
the
language
offenses
indictable
was
deleted
and
the
statute
was
expanded
to
include
acts,
transactions
and
so
on
and
applied
to
specifically
the
contracts
settlement
act.
in
1954,
in
october,
three
months
later,
and
in
the
same
volume
of
the
statute
at
large,
58
stat.
765,
the
surplus
property
act
contained
an
amendment
to
this
suspension
of
limitation
section.
that
is
section
28
of
the
surplus
property
act
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
yes,
sir.
it
was.
and
at
that
time
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
as
it
had
been
amended,
only
three
months
before
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
yes,
sir.
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
we
submitted
on
our
earlier
portion
of
the
argument
that
section
28
is
that
suspension
section
relating
to
acts,
transactions,
and
offenses.
not
only
offenses
now
indictable
and
that
it
follows
by
two
sections,
the
subject
26
(b)
(1)
here
on
the
consideration.
we
submit
that
the
congress
definitely
must
have
intended
or
assume
that
the
provisions
of
the
surplus
property
act
ant
the
contract
settlement
act
in
each
of
which
statutes,
they
took
the
trouble
to
enact
suspension
sections
were
bound
by
or
governed
by
limitations.
otherwise,
the
presence
of
those
suspension
sections
in
that
very
act
containing
no
criminal
aspects
of
its
own
would
be
a
rather
unusual
method
of
draftsmanship.
now,
the
government
assumes
in
their
argument
that
we
agree
that
these
damages
exist.we
definitely
do
not
agree
on
any
such
thing.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
at
all
which
relates
to
damages
to
a
program
or
damages
in
any
other
sort
other
than
the
offenses
complained
of
were
committed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
super
priority
which
is
referred
to
by
the
government
was
not
enacted
until
two
of
the
three
acts
complained
about
had
already
taken
place.
the
super
priority
section
as
it's
been
referred
to
was
enacted
on
may
3rd,
1946.
and
it
gave
the
secretary
the
right
to
delegate
or
to
separate
certain
of
the
surplus
vehicles
for
the
benefit
of
veterans
if
he
so
chose.
however,
the
two
acts,
the
first
two
acts
have
already
occurred
then.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
any
such
delegation
ever
took
place
during
the
offenses
complained
off
in
this
case,
none
whatever.
we
feel
that
there
should
be
and
there
is
a
differentiation
between
a
penalty
as
the
language
uses
it
and
the
purpose
for
which
that
is
applied.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
the
question
of
penalty
may
be
applied
in
an
international
law
sense
where
one
state
enforced
the
law
of
the
state
of
another.
it
may
be
applied
as
to
double
jeopardy
as
it
was
in
rex
trailer
and
marcus.
it
may
very
well
be
applied
to
determine
whether
a
defendant
be
required
to
testify.
now,
none
of
those
issues
have
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
as
applied
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
is
true,
and
i
am
somewhat
interested
as
to
why,
in
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion.
he
says,
we
took
certiorari
--
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
asserted
conflict
and
it
wasn't
until
--
as
read
in
the
government's
brief
that
they
--
they
had
joined
in
that
request
rather
than
opposing
it
as
here.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
the
conflict
involves
limitation.
the
issue
involves
double
jeopardy
and
as
we
respectfully
stated,
i
hope
in
our
brief
--
after
merely
--
a
footnote
reference
to
it
--
the
court
exclusively
devoted
itself
to
double
jeopardy.
that's
why
we
say,
sir
that
we
are
here
for
the
first
time
on
the
question
of
limitations.
and
we
--
we
do
very
hardly
recommend
the
priebe
case
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
questioning
the
government.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
the
previous
cases
is
one
which
sets
forth
quite
clearly
that
in
the
absence
of
any
measure
of
damage
or
any
proof
of
damage
whatsoever,
an
interorum
provision
to
be
applied
upon
the
occurrence
of
an
event
regardless
of
whether
any
actual
damages
sustained
or
not
is
a
penalty.
and
the
language
in
that
case
has
been
followed
and
it's
the
foundation
for
the
law
as
we
understand
liquidated
damages.
the
final
point
that
i
think
we
should
make
regardless
of
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
government,
there
is
not
one
which
contains
a
provision
for
$2000
or
its
ilk
and
a
multiple
or
a
fraction
of
provable
damage
in
every
case,
helvering
and
mithcell,
huntington
and
attrill
all
those
cited
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
government's
brief.
nowhere
is
there
a
situation
which
says
take
$2000
and
double
or
a
half
of
the
provable
damage.
that
$2000
was
decided
in
marcus
and
hess
to
be
collectible
regardless
of
any
proof
of
actual
damage
whatsoever.
and
with
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
malis
it
would,
sir.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
if
there
were
seven
defendants
who
conspired
together,
but
committed
not
one
over
a
day,
however,
these
seven
defendants
would
each
be
liable
for
the
$2000.
mr.
robert
h.
malis
well,
the
congress
has
clearly
indicated
the
--
that
26
(b)
(2)
and
(3)
are
liquidated
damages.
they've
so
stated.
in
our
brief,
we
say
that
that
determination
is
not
before
us.
when
they
add
$2000
to
a
multiple,
and
the
multiple
--
you'll
see,
your
honor
pleases,
the
multiple
stands
for
its
foundation
upon
proof
of
actual
damage.
and
the
jury
returns
the
verdict
the
government
has
been
damaged
for
$1000.
then
we
doubled
it.
this
is
in
a
sense,
compensatory.
it
is
smart
money
that
congress
has
said,
“it
is
given
to
the
person
injured.”
here,
however,
the
basic
distinction
and
the
damages
lies
in
the
accessibility
of
that
$2000
forfeiture
or
stipend
as
the
courts
have
referred
with,
irrespective
of
one
nickel
worth
of
damage
or
any
proof
of
any
damage.
plus,
when
added
to
it,
double
the
amount.
you
see,
this
is
really
intended
to
enforce
the
policy
to
prevent
to
punish.
and
it
is
this
sort
of
thing
that
the
congress
in
enacting
2462
and
referring
back
to
your
honor's
opinions
in
marcus
and
hess
said,
“we
may
recover
such
a
thing
in
a
civil
suit.”
if
this
is
the
philosophy
of
the
court
and
the
language
which
the
court
uses
to
define
this
$2000
26
(b)
(1)
and
then
for
hundred
years,
the
congress
has
failed
to
repeal
the
existing
statute
of
limitations
in
the
false
claims
act
further
indicating
its
satisfaction
with
it
and
the
fact
further
that
congress
in
1948
reenacted
this
100-year-old
statute
of
limitations.
these
things
are
all
in
my
mind,
indicative
of
an
intention
and
an
understanding
that
2462
regardless
of
what
we
call
26
(b)
(1),
whether
we
call
it
penalty
or
forfeiture
or
civil
crime
or
compensatory,
for
the
limited
purpose
of
limitations
as
oppose
to
double
jeopardy
or
international
law.
but
for
the
limited
purpose
of
limitations,
we
urge
that
the
congress
understood
2462
to
full
and
rely
upon
and
to
govern
such
a
suit.
all
the
government
had
to
do
here,
they
had
nine
years
legally.
all
they
had
to
do
here
was
to
institute
suit
before
the
suspension
section
applies.
i
--
i
commend
to
your
honors
the
case
of
mckenna
versus
armour
which
was
affirmed
in
254
f.2d
90
and
certiorari
denied
in
this
court
in
358
u.s.
834
this
year
--
1958
in
which
that
point
of
the
suspension
section
applying
to
civil
actions
was
decided.
and
so,
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
government
started
10
years
after
they
should
have.
five
years
after
the
men
were
indicted
and
that
they
are
bound
by
the
statute
of
limitation.
