how
about
the
--
in
addition
to
double
damages
under
subsection
--
subparagraph
(1)
there
was
the
sum
of
$2000
for
each
act,
without
any
reference
at
all
(inaudible)
true,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kestenbaum,
i
don't
want
to
interfere
with
the
--
your
own
order
of
your
argument
but
i
understood
in
learning
before
you
conclude
a
really
fine
information
as
to
the
suspension
of
the
statute
of
limitations
during
world
war
ii
and
as
to
how
that
fits
into
this
case
at
least
from
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
far
as
your
position
goes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
hear
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
--
what
statute
of
limitation
was
suspended
and
when
and
for
how
long?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
--
this
would
have
applied
to
the
--
to
the
criminal
offense
under
which
these
people
were
cross
--
were
convicted.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
--
any
applicable
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
that
offense
was
extended
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does.
i
--
would
it
be
your
position
that
the
specific
statute
of
limitations
in
the
false
claims
act
was
told
by
this
legislation
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
that
act
to
false
claims
act
under
which
marcus
against
hess
was
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
that
act,
the
surplus
property
act
which
is
the
one
here
involved
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
originally
enacted
1944,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
part
of
that
act
was
an
amendment
to
the
suspension
of
the
--
of
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
potter
stewart
it
had
been
amended
earlier
1944.
