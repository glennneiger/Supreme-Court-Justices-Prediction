justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
view
of
the
matter,
could
the
defendant
(inaudible)
the
government
call
under
the
witness
and
extract
evidence
from
him?
i'm
not
saying
this
intermittently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
the
nice
distinction
that
had
been
taken
in
a
civil
penalty
for
which
a
civil
action
is
brought,
the
verdict
can
be
directed
unlike
criminal
case,
the
jury
can
be
told
to
bring
in
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
i
--
these
are
nice
questions.
i
want
to
get
light
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
mean
the
$2000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
thinking
of
(voice
overlap)
against
united
states
and
heffner
against
united
states.there
are
all
sorts
of
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
--
but
the
court
held
as
you
know
that
a
(inaudible)
can
be
directed
in
favor
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
i
noticed
that
--
i
suppose
i
wonder
when
that
came
into
the
legislative
phraseology.
a
civil
fine,
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
that
was
after
heffner
--
you
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
a
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture.
is
that
a
modern
trade
in
penalty
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
--
i'm
getting
myself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
civil
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
it
was
1839?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it
was
a
civil
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that's
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
recent
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
wasn't
in
the
older
cases,
which
you
refer
to
these
against
united
states,
penalty
against
steamship
companies
for
bringing
in
illicitly
aliens
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
merely
putting
the
label
of
a
civil
penalty
that
is
a
penalty
which
may
be
pursued
as
a
civil
action
is
not
an
all
embracing
comprehensive
term
because
as
lead
shows
although
the
action
is
maybe
brought
similarly
and
although
verdict
maybe
directed,
yet
the
privilege
against
self
discrimination
qualifies
the
civil
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying
this
is
a
civil
penalty
and
it
doesn't
add
all
legal
purpose
may
answer
your
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
congress
in
the
instances
we're
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
congress
didn't
say
anything.
this
is
all
court
fashion.
heffner
is
court
fashioned
anything
against
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
answer
was
derived
from
policies
behind,
respective
claims
that
were
asserted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
do
with
priebe?
is
that
the
name
of
the
case
i'm
thinking
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
--
before
the
court
got
to
that
it
has
to
decide
whether
it's
a
compensatory
provision
or
merely
an
exact
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
question,
in
a
way,
is
the
same
as
this,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
priebe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
a
constitutional
question
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
has,
so
clearly
you
and
i
wouldn't
be
here
on
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
is
that
this
is
merely
a
question
of
ascertaining
damages
and
the
violation
of
a
contract
or
ascertaining
damages
for
breach
of
what
we
called
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
determination
here
of
fixation
--
fixing
at
the
outset
by
congress
so
as
not
to
pursue
the
controversy
of
litigation
except
--
but
there's
an
element
of
smart
money,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
you
say
you
can
ascertain
what
the
actual
damage
is,
as
you
do
in
ordinary
contracts
on
both
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
jury
gets.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
when
they
say,
â€œwell,
a
statute
of
limitation
is
--
also
have
a
policy.
the
longer
statute
relates
to
a
more
serious
business
and
shorter
statute
(inaudible)
you
want
to
leave
time
openings
for
all
the
delays
and
the
uncertainties
of
getting
the
litigating
process
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
congress
seemed
fit
to
fix
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
burden
to
show
that
this
is
clearly
compensatory
and
not
an
additional
smarty.
