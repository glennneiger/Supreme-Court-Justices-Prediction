mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
fraudulent
misuse
of
veterans
priority
established
under
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944.
in
this
act,
the
congress
provided
for
the
disposal
of
vast
quantity
of
goods
which
would
be
left
over
at
the
end
of
the
second
world
war.
the
statutory
objective
included
fair
distribution
of
goods,
avoidance
of
dislocation
of
the
economy,
discouragement
of
speculation,
and
encouragement
of
small
business
specifically
aid
to
returning
veterans
was
mentioned.
by
1946
amendment,
veterans
were
given
a
priority
second
only
to
that
of
the
federal
government.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
veterans
were
given
the
exclusive
right
to
acquire
certain
specific
types
and
quantities
of
property
which
was
set
aside
for
them.
these
--
a
lot
of
types
and
quantities
and
property
could
be
acquired
by
veterans
who
desire
to
acquire
them
for
their
own
personal
use
or
for
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
their
own
small
business.
now,
petitioners,
koller
and
silverbrook
were
veterans
who
applied
for
and
obtained
these
priority
certificates.
they
--
instead
of
using
them
for
the
purposes
to
which
were
intended
and
which
were
certified
in
their
application,
they
sold
them
to
a
third
party.
koller
executed
two
fraudulent
applications
and
this
--
his
certificates
were
used
by
the
third
party
to
purchase
two
trucks
and
one
car.
silverbrook's
certificate
was
used
to
purchase
six
busses
and
three
trucks.
both
petitioners
were
indicted
to
these
fraudulent
acts.
they
pleaded
guilty,
and
they
each
paid
small
fines.
in
the
present
case
as
mr.
malis
stated
the
third
day,
the
government
has
to
enforce
civil
remedies
provided
by
this
act,
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944.
section
26
(b)
sets
forth
three
alternative
measures
of
recovery
and
the
first
one
was
the
one
used
here,
$2000
for
each
fraudulent
act
and
double
damages.
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
koller
for
$4000,
against
silverbrook
for
$2000.
the
petitioners'
only
defense
was
that
the
suit
was
barred
by
statute
of
limitations
because
it
is
not
been
brought
within
five
years
of
the
acts
complained
of.
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
in
the
surplus
property
act
itself,
the
--
one
rely
to
parties,
one
contained
in
title
28,
section
2462
imposing
a
five-year
limitation
upon
suits
for
a
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture.
the
courts
below
--
both
courts
below
relied
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
only
three
years
ago,
rex
trailer
company
versus
united
states
and
held
that
the
recovery
sought
by
the
government
and
obtained
by
the
government
was
not
such
as
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture.
now,
the
petitioners
do
not
dispute
that
damage
to
the
government
could
be
anticipated
from
violations
of
this
act.
there's
none
for
that
matter
that
damage
was
actually
sustained
here.
and
i
think
the
problem
can
be
put
in
a
perspective
by
examining
the
elements
of
damage
which
the
court
set
forth
in
rex
trailer
company
versus
united
states.
first,
the
policy
of
the
congress
concerning
disposal
of
this
property
were
frustrated.
the
fraud
diverted
the
vehicles,
these
12
vehicles
from
veterans
or
other
priority
claimants
who
were
entitled
to
them.
second,
mr.
justice
clark
in
rex
trailer
company
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
pecuniary
loss
suffered
by
the
united
states.
the
sale
on
these
priority
certificates
was
at
a
much
lower
price
than
petitioners
or
anyone
else
could
have
paid
--
could
have
paid
for
these
vehicles
on
the
open
market.
so,
the
government
sold
these
vehicles
for
a
price
lower
than
their
market
value.
in
addition,
since
the
fraud
decreased
the
number
of
vehicles
available
to
government
agencies,
it
may
very
well
be
--
it
could
be
reasonably
anticipated
that
a
--
federal
agencies
would
have
to
go
out
and
buy
the
same
vehicles
because
they
have
been
obtained
fraudulently
by
impeachment.
third
is
the
element
of
the
unjust
enrichment
to
the
perpetuators
of
the
fraud
themselves.
mr.
--
mr.
justice
clark
indicated
these
elements
in
the
rex
trailer
case
but
the
record
there
was
not
adequate
to
show
its
existence.
here
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
admitted
fact
that
the
petitioners
sold
their
certificates
to
this
third
party
for
a
consideration,
a
consideration
which
undoubtedly
reflected
the
difference
between
the
market
value
of
these
vehicles
and
the
price
which
the
government
was
wiling
to
take
from
veterans
and
veterans
alone.
fourth
element,
not
mentioned
by
the
court
in
rex
trailer
but
pointed
out
by
the
third
circuit
in
this
case.
it's
the
element
of
the
cause
of
investigation
and
litigation
which
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
in
setting
up
this
measure
of
recovery
in
the
act.
now,
once
these
items
of
damage
--
anticipated
damage
are
set
forth
then
it
becomes
clear
that
what
we
have
here
in
26
(b)
(1)
of
the
surplus
property
act
is
a
common
legislative
device.
to
use
the
language
in
the
rex
trailer
case
is
the
fixing
of
a
lump
sum
in
damages
in
a
situation
where
the
actual
damage
maybe
difficult
or
impossible
to
ascertain.
now,
the
court
also
said,
it
is
the
function
of
liquidated
damages
to
provide
a
measure
of
recovery
and
just
of
circumstances.
the
judgment
for
$2000
for
each
fraudulent
act
which
was
the
one
upheld
in
that
case
was
held
comparable
to
recovery
under
liquidated
damage
provisions.
in
the
same
way
in
marcus
versus
hess
of
317
u.s.,
the
almost
identical
civil
remedy
of
the
false
claims
act
was
involved.
and
the
court
held
there
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
kind
of
recovery
was
to
provide
indemnity
or
restitution
to
the
government
for
--
for
the
fraud
against
it.
the
device
of
double
damages
plus
specific
sum
was
chosen,
the
court
said,
to
assure
that
the
government
would
be
made
completely
whole.
and
the
choice
of
such
a
sum,
the
discretion
in
fixing
this
kind
of
recovery
to
assure
that
the
government
would
be
is
whole
the
choice
was
up
to
congress.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes,
mr.
justice.
there
are
many
such
civil
penalties
in
the
u.s.
code
and
there
are
many
--
and
there
are
a
number
of
them
which
are
exampled
by
cases
under
2462
itself
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
--
some
prominent
ones,
i
can
give
a
few
as
an
example.
if
a
railroad
which
violates
--
which
fail
to
comply
with
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
would
have
to
pay
a
certain
penalty
of
the
violation
and
certain
number
of
dollars
for
each
day
during
which
this
violation
continues.
a
farmer
who
sells
a
certain
amount
of
his
crop
above
his
permissible
marketing
quota,
is
subject
to
a
penalty.
a
few
others,
a
ship
owner
who
requires
a
seaman
to
work
more
than
eight
hours
a
day,
pay
a
sentence
of
--
is
subject
for
the
payment
of
a
certain
sum.
this
kind
of
penalty
goes
way
back.
one
of
the
earliest
ones
we
have
is
a
participation
in
a
slave
trade
which
could
result
in
a
forfeiture
of
vessel
and
the
payment
of
certain
sum.
i
think
the
key
to
all
these
cases
and
each
one
of
these
situations,
there
was
no
transaction
of
the
government.
there
was
no
possible
foreseeable
liability
to
the
government
under
any
contract
towards
principles.
and
so
what
we
have
in
those
situations,
the
government
is
seeking
to
vindicate
either
a
general
public
policy
or
the
interest
of
a
specific
protected
class
like
seaman
or
another
situation,
indians.
the
statutes
state
that
a
person
who
surveyed
indian
land
illegally
is
subject
to
a
penalty
of
$1000
which
the
government
can
collect.
now,
this
line
has
been
indeed
drawn
under
2462.
the
cases
under
2462
recognize
that
a
legislature
--
the
congress
or
legislature
of
the
states
can
establish
measures
of
liquidated
damages
in
a
situation
where
it
might
be
difficult
or
impossible
to
prove
actual
damage.
and
in
no
such
recovery
whether
it's
double
damages,
treble
damages
or
a
fix
sum,
no
such
recovery
has
ever
been
held
to
constitute
a
penalty
under
this
statute
of
limitations
into
full
with
in
it.
the
line
was
set
forth
by
this
court
i
think
quite
clearly
in
meeker
versus
lehigh
valley
railroad,
236
united
states,
that
where
the
statutory
liability
fix
runs
to
readdress
a
private
injury
that
is
it
runs
in
favor
of
the
party
who
was
injured
or
to
whom
injury
was
anticipated,
then
it
cannot
be
a
fine,
a
penalty
or
forfeiture.
hence,
it's
not
covered
by
this
limitations
period.
i
think
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
following
that
--
i
think
the
error
in
the
petitioner's
position
and
the
error
in
the
one
conflicting
decision
--
that
of
the
court
of
claims
is
demonstrated
by
their
assumption
that
double
damages
is
necessarily
a
penalty.
under
2462,
this
court
has
held
explicitly
that
treble
damages
--
that
treble
damage
is
recoverable
under
the
antitrust
laws
that
those
treble
damages
are
--
do
not
constitute
a
penalty
or
a
fine.
and
hence,
are
not
covered
by
these
limitations
period.
what
they
do
constitute,
they
constitute
a
measure
of
recovery
which
a
legislature
sought
to
establish.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
well,
the
--
that
section
provide
both
the
double
damages
and
the
$2000.
and
the
court
stated
in
marcus
versus
hess
which
i
referred
to
just
a
moment
ago
that
it
is
a
--
that
the
device
of
these
two
together,
double
damages
and
$2000
to
recheck
was
the
device
chosen
by
congress
to
provide
full
restitution.
i
think
this
case
is
an
example
of
the
fact
that
it's
very
difficult
to
prove
double
damages.
the
government
did
not
seek
to
prove
double
damages,
and
the
recovery
here
consist
only
this
fix
sum.
that's
very
often
the
case.
in
marcus
versus
hess
which
is
under
the
false
claims
act,
there
was
a
judgment
for
both
elements
together.
and
the
court
said,
“this
is
a
measure
of
indemnity,
a
measure
of
restitution
for
the
wrong
done
by
the
government.”
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes,
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
wish
i
have
a
moment.
the
third
circuit,
of
course,
recognized
that
the
ultimate
question
in
both
the
cases
to
which
i
referred
in
rex
trailer
and
the
marcus
versus
hess.
the
ultimate
question
was
different
and
that
it
concerned
the
application
of
double
jeopardy
clause.but
the
rationality
of
these
decisions
is
what
is
controlling.
the
rationality
of
these
decisions
is
dispositive
in
this
case
for
petitioners
conceived
that
if
this
recovery
can
be
characterized
as
liquidated
damages.
if
that's
what
it
is,
then
it
is
not
covered
by
this
statute
of
limitation.
and
i
may
say
in
passing
that
the
characterization,
the
definition
of
this
recovery
as
liquidated
damages
was
the
very
basis
for
the
decision
in
those
two
cases.
they
can
hardly
be
dismissed
as
dicta.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
held
that
since
it
was
liquidated
damages.
therefore,
the
recovery
would
--
was
a
civil
recovery.
and
the
--
that
part
of
the
--
that
element
in
the
case
is
what
controls
here.
not
only
is
the
rationality
is
positive.
but
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
clark
show
--
said
in
rex
trailer
that
certiorari
was
granted
specifically
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
in
this
case,
mr.
justice?
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
of
course
the
problem
is
not
--
is
not
presented
here
mr.
justice.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
seems
there
could
be
a
criminal
prosecution.
there
is
a
criminal
penalty
involved
aside
from
this
recovery
which
is
involved
here.
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
no,
no.
there
is
--
the
person
who
perpetuated
(voice
overlap)
could
be
proceeded
against
for
this
fraud
under
criminal
provisions
of
the
--
of
title
18.
and
for
that
reason,
they
would
be
protected
by
those
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
heffner
involved
a
penalty.
it
was
a
--
an
amount
which
a
person
could
be
forced
to
pay
for
soliciting
immigration
illegally
into
the
united
states.
it
would
fit
into
what
i've
suggested
before
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
such
a
penalty
was
a
civil
penalty.
it
could
be
recovered
in
a
civil
action.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
the
acts
--
the
statute
of
limitations
was
passed
in
1839
and
at
that
time,
it
referred
to
recovery
--
as
a
recovery
for
any
penalty
of
forfeiture
pecuniary
or
otherwise.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
understand.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
in
this
provision,
it
came
in
when
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
statute
of
limitations
originally
comes
from
1839.
i
think
this
language
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
think
that
came
in
when
it
was
codified
in
1948.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i
think
what
i
meant
by
answering
your
question
before,
mr.
justice
was
that
heffner
hold
that
this
--
this
is
a
civil
penalty.
it
can
be
recovered
in
a
civil
proceeding
and
this
would
be
--
the
precise
kind
of
penalty
that
we
claim
is
covered
by
the
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes,
i
quite
--
i
quite
understand,
mr.
justice.
and
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
think
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
connection
with
that,
that
in
one
sense,
the
problem
presented
with
respect
to
such
recovery
under
constitutional
provisions
is
a
much
more
difficult
one
than
the
one
we
have
here.
under
the
ones
to
which
you
referred,
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
argued
that
whatever
congress
said
is
not
controlling.
as
your
honor
just
stated,
the
congress
is
of
course
restrained
by
these
constitutional
provisions,
and
you
cannot
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
understand,
mr.
justice.
the
point
that
i
was
making
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
and
the
answer
was
derived
i
would
think
also
from
the
problems
of
interpreting
and
applying
this
constitutional
provisions.
in
that
sense,
our
case
is
much
easier
for
awhile
congress
cannot
alter
or
cannot
transgress
this
constitutional
provisions.
what
we
have
here
is
a
statute
of
limitations
problem
which
is
wholly
within
the
power
of
congress.
as
it
sees
fit,
congress
can
either
decide
to
impose
a
limitation
period
upon
claims
accruing
to
the
united
states
or
cannot
do
so.
ordinarily,
in
civil
situations,
there
is
no
limitation
period
against
the
government.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes,
i
think
there
is
a
name
--
there
is
a
case
by
that
name,
mr.
justice.
that
case
held
that
a
liquidated
damage
provision
set
forth
in
a
government
contract
was
a
penalty
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
enforced.
but
here
of
course,
we
have
one
established
by
congress.
so,
there's
no
question
about
its
forcibility,
the
only
question
is
what
are
the
consequences
of
this
kind
of
measure
of
damages.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct,
except
--
if
congress
--
the
point
i
was
just
making
in
distinguishing
this
situation
from
a
constitutional
problem
is
that
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
understand
that.
but
in
this
situation,
my
point
is
that
if
congress
has
indicated
its
intention,
its
characterization
of
this
kind
of
recovery
as
a
measure
of
compensatory
recovery,
then
that
simply
settled
the
issues
since
the
matter
is
one
wholly
within
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i
may
say
that
every
court
other
than
one
court,
the
court
of
claims
has
held
that
this
is
clear
--
this
is
a
clear
intention
that
has
been
a
clear
intention
of
congress
and
clearly
expressed.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes,
i
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
or
when
the
government
is
--
when
the
government
is
involved,
mr.
justice,
in
ordinary
civil
recoveries,
the
government
has
no
statute
of
limitation
applicable
against
it.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
seem
fit
to
fix
one
in
a
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture
area.
and
what
i
was
stating
before
was
that
if
the
congress
has
indicated
its
intention
that
this
is
a
compensatory
device,
then
that
would
settle
the
issue
even
though
just
taking
it
apart
from
that
congressional
intention
and
we
might
have
a
--
we
might
have
a
problem
upon
which
you
might
differ.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i
would
--
i
would
put
it
two
ways.
one,
that
we
believe
that
rex
trailer
and
the
--
and
marcus
versus
hess
hold
that
this
is
a
compensatory
device.
and
second,
that
congress
has
clearly
indicated
this
intention
--
this
characterization
as
its
intention.
and
that
therefore,
that
settles
the
question.
as
far
as
the
intention
of
congress
is
concerned,
the
court
stated
it.
the
court
set
it
forth
in
rex
trailer.
i
will
just
repeat
these
elements
for
a
moment
here.
congress,
in
the
first
place,
copied
section
26
(b)
(1)
from
the
comparable
provision
of
the
false
claims
act.
and
this
court,
just
a
year
before
the
surplus
property
act
was
passed,
this
court
had
held
the
same
recovery,
$2000
for
each
act
and
double
damages
to
constitute
a
compensatory
civil
remedy.
as
mr.
justice
clark
said
in
rex
trailer,
obviously,
when
congress
copied
this
language,
it
intended
a
similar
compensatory
device
in
this
act.
second,
congress
specifically
designated
the
two
alternative
measures
of
recovery
in
26
(b)
as
liquidated
damages.
the
petitioner's
argue
that
that
indicate
some
sort
of
distinction
between
subdivisions
(2)
and
(3)
and
subdivision
--
subdivision
(1)
which
are
set
forth
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
in
the
first
place
contained
in
rex
trailer
itself.
the
court
said
that
each
one
of
these
three
alternatives
can
be
selected
by
the
government
at
its
option
and
each
was
of
the
same
nature.
if
there
has
to
be
an
explanation,
i
think
the
explanation
lies
in
the
chronology
to
which
--
which
i
just
referred.
since
this
court
had
already
held
26
(b)
(1)
or
its
equivalent
to
constitute
a
measure
of
liquidated
damages,
the
congress
began
with
it
that
it
did
not
have
to
characterize
it.
this
court
has
already
done
so.
and
then
added
on
these
two
alternative
methods
which
the
government
--
which
the
united
states
could
allege
and
each
one
of
those
was
characterized
by
the
congress
as
liquidated
damages
to
assure
that
it
will
be
treated
the
same
way.
turning
to
the
suspension
provision
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
a
moment
ago,
i
think
that
no
contrary
implication
of
a
congressional
intent
can
be
drawn
from
that
suspension
provision.
that
a
suspension
applies
to
a
number
of
statutes
under
which
the
government
proceeds.
and
even
if
it
does
cover
also
civil
statute
of
limitations
as
well
as
criminal
statutes,
even
if
it
does
cover
civil
statute,
even
if
it
does
hold
civil
statute
of
limitation,
there
is
nothing
to
intimate
--
there's
nothing
in
its
passage
to
intimate
that
congress
thought
there
was
a
civil
statute
which
applied
to
the
recovery
in
the
surplus
property
act.
the
third
circuit
not
only
relied
upon
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
marcus
versus
hess
and
in
rex
trailer
but
it
pointed
out
as
i
was
stating
a
moment
ago
that
certiorari
had
been
granted
in
rex
trailer
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
that's
conflict,
the
conflict
referred
to
was
the
conflict
on
this
precise
issue,
the
statute
of
limitation
issue.
the
third
circuit
said
that
it
believe
that
the
court
in
deciding
rex
trailer
must
have
resolve
the
very
conflict
to
which
it
had
referred
in
its
opinion.
and
we
submit
that
the
third
circuit
was
justified
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
and
the
same
conclusion
had,
as
i
indicated,
been
reached
by
every
other
court
that
has
been
faced
with
this
problem
other
then
the
court
of
claims.
as
i
already
have
indicted
this
conclusion
below
is
demonstrated
to
be
correct
by
the
uniform
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
limitation
itself.
petitioners
have
cited
various
cases
using
the
words
penalty.
but
not
only
do
they
ignore
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
rex
trailer
and
in
the
marcus
versus
hess
but
they
also
ignore
this
uniform
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
limitation
itself.
this
act
has
been
on
the
book
since
1839
and
--
and
as
i've
stated,
it
has
never
been
applied
to
a
measure
of
recovery
fixed
by
a
legislature
as
a
mode
of
liquidated
damages
to
which
an
injured
party
can
rely
upon.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
we
contend,
justice
first
that
it
is
not
--
cannot
be
called
civil
penalty
that
this
court
had
already
held
that
it
is
not
a
civil
penalty.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
we
would
contend,
mr.
justice
that
even
if
it
might
be
going
on
a
civil
penalty
for
other
purposes
and
as
far
the
statute
of
limitation
is
concerned,
the
congress
has
sufficiently
indicated
that
it
is
not
covered
by
the
statute,
that
it
is
comparable
to
a
civil
compensatory
action
for
damages.
and
for
that
reason,
this
congressional
intent
is
conclusive
on
this
issue.
this
issue
being
one
which
i
have
indicated
is
wholly
within
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
think
i've
tried
to
answer
very
briefly,
mr.
justice
just
a
moment
ago.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
the
--
i
stated
that
a
suspension
does
not
indicate
a
contrary
congressional
intent
since
it
applies
to
a
number
of
statutes
which
cover
frauds
against
the
united
states.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
the
statute
--
as
the
suspension
statute
indicates,
it's
set
forth
in
page
27
of
our
brief.
it
applies
to
all
offenses.
any
existing
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
any
offense
involving
fraud
against
the
united
states,
there
are
a
number
of
such
criminal
penalties
set
forth
in
the
united
states
code
and
each
one
of
those
would
be
told
until
three
years
after
the
termination
of
hostilities.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct,
yes.
now,
there
are
some
disputes
as
to
whether
it
applies
to
civil
statute.
our
brief
indicated
that
it
did
not
or
there
are
some
lower
court
--
district
court
holdings
that
this
also
told
civil
statues
of
limitation.
i
may
say
that
the
false
claims
act,
the
one
involved
in
marcus
versus
hess
had
a
civil
statute
of
limitation.
so,
even
if
the
congress
was
intending
by
this
suspension
to
affect
civil
statute
of
limitations,
there
is
another
one
which
it
might
have
wanted
to
affect.
there's
certainly
no
intimation
that
congress
thought
there
was
a
civil
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
this
statue,
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944.
there
is
none
in
this
civil
--
in
the
surplus
property
act
and
the
false
claims
act
had
to
contain
a
specific
statute
of
limitations
in
order
to
have
one
applicable
to
it.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
justice?
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
government
has
taken
that
position
in
a
number
of
district
court
cases
and
has
--
those
district
courts
have
so
held.
but
i
was
--
my
position
is
that
whether
or
not
this
applies
to
a
civil
statute
of
limitation,
it
certainly
doesn't
indicate
any
congressional
intent
that
there
was
a
civil
statute
here
for
the
false
claims
act
itself
had
to
contain
its
own
civil
statute.
the
false
claims
act
does
not
rely
upon
any
civil
statutes
applicable
to
fines,
penalties
or
forfeitures
which
is
the
one
which
we
have
here.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
so,
i've
got
stated
the
surplus
property
act
involves
not
an
attempt
by
the
government.
it
has
indicated
general
public
policy
or
the
interest
of
a
protected
class,
it
involves
a
situation
in
which
damage
to
the
government
could
have
been
anticipated.
just
as
congress
can
fix
a
measure
of
recovery
such
as
double
or
treble
damages
involving
private
plaintiffs
so
it
can
fix
the
same
kind
of
measure
when
the
government
itself
was
the
one
which
was
injured.
and
as
this
court
has
held
and
as
congress
intended,
the
civil
remedies
in
this
act
constitute
a
measure
of
liquidated
damages
to
the
party
injured
here
in
the
united
states.
and
for
that
reason,
the
statute
of
limitation
for
penalties
and
forfeitures
is
not
--
not
applicable.
