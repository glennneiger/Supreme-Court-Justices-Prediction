mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
excuse
me
your
honor,
may
i
move
the
admission
of
mr.
pollock
before
the
state
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
have
reached
the
point
in
my
argument
where
i
was
about
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
--
the
meaning
and
definition
of
the
word
“personal”
as
it
appears
in
section
24
of
the
code.
the
word
--
the
--
the
word
“personal”,
as
used
in
section
24,
has
two
distinct
factors.
the
statute
says
that
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
personal
expenses.
now,
the
denial
of
the
deduction
is
a
legal
conclusion
and
such
denial
should
follow
a
determination
at
a
particular
expense
of
this
person.
to
restate,
this
means
that,
and
to
my
mind
and
nothing
but
a
factual
determination
of
personal,
should
precede
the
legal
conclusion
of
nondeductibility.
this
seems
patent
from
the
statute
itself.
now,
in
the
commissioner's
argument
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
below,
this
is
the
method
by
which
the
conclusion
of
personal
results.
referring
again
to
my
previous
reference
that
the
commissioner
said
this
expense
should
be
denied
for
the
reason
that
petitioners
are
not
away
from
home.
now,
the
--
the
deduction
was
originally
denied
for
the
reason
that
the
expenses
were
classified
as
personal.
the
--
the
word
“home”
appears
in
section
23.
the
word
“personal”
appears
in
section
24.
now,
they
are
finding
their
criteria
of
the
--
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“personal”
in
section
23.
and
the
--
the
logic
of
the
commissioner's
theory
then
becomes
this.
under
section
23,
the
deduction
is
denied
automatically
once
the
doctrine
is
applied
the
way
you
work
at
your
home
because
you
cannot
be
away
from
such
a
home
at
work.
this
is
a
logical
impact.
then
they
say
the
expense
is
personal.
in
other
words,
they
say
it's
personal
because
it's
nondeductible
as
they
have
defined
the
word
“home”.
the
whole
structure
of
24
is
thereby
reversed
instead
of
determining
that
the
thing
is
nondeductible
because
it's
personal,
they
first
determined
that
it
is
nondeductible
under
section
23
and
then
label
it
personal
and
this
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
your
honor,
i
--
i
say
yes,
provided
the
facts
are
kept
clear,
but
this
is
done
purely
as
a
rule
of
law.
requirement
one
under
the
flowers
decision
says
the
expense
must
be
ordinary
and
necessary.
now,
under
the
commissioner's
theory
that
we
have
only
failed
to
meet
requirement
two
that
factually
concedes
that
our
expenses
are
ordinary
and
necessary.
yet,
at
the
same
time
they
are
holding
that
these
expenses
are
personal.
now,
i
say
that
factually,
these
are
in
conflict.
i
turn
to
requirement
three
of
the
flowers
case.
requirement
three
says
that
the
expense
must
be
incurred
into
pursue
of
the
trade.
now,
again,
under
the
commissioner's
theory,
that
factually
concedes
that
my
petitioners
had
met
this
requirement
in
a
factual
sense,
and
i
also
state
that
is
factually
in
conflict.
and
further,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the
word
“blend”
correctly
presents
this
issue.
i
think
this.
i
think
that
since
section
24
is
the
section
that
was
enacted
to
deny
certain
expenses
that
a
factual
determination
should
be
made
under
section
24
logically
prior
to
a
determination
under
section
23
for
if
a
factual
determination
is
made,
that
expense
is
personal.
section
24
strikes
it
down
immediately.
there
is
no
necessity
to
refer
to
section
23
in
any
way
because
section
24
says,
“no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
a
personal
expenditure.”
now,
in
the
proceedings
below,
in
the
tax
court,
the
criteria
by
which
this
matter
was
resolved
and
which
has
been
used
in
other
cases
stated
in
brief
on
rare
occasions,
but
has
never
been
fully
implemented
was
that
an
inquiry
should
be
made
to
determine
whether
or
not
under
the
all
of
the
factual
circumstances
is
reasonable
to
expect
demand
to
move
his
home
to
his
place
of
employment.
now,
if
under
that
criteria,
which
was
--
which
was
developed
in
the
tax
court's
decisions
and
which
was
reviewed
by
the
entire
court,
your
honor,
they
determined
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
our
petitioners
to
move
their
homes
to
construction
sites
under
these
factual
circumstances.
with
that
factual
determination
before
the
court,
then
the
question
of
the
personal
nature
of
these
expenses
were
disposed
of
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
all
of
these
travel
expenses,
the
commuting
situation
which
has
complicated
this
issue
ever
since
the
barnhill
case.
unfortunately,
the
barnhill
case
realized
that
commuting
in
a
sense,
forces
travel
to
get
to
work.
and
they
said,
“we
cannot
reach
the
conclusion
that
a
man's
home
is
where
he
lives
because
of
the
commuting
analogy.”
but
there
are
two
rebuttals
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
commuting
expense
and
travel
expense
must
be
separate
and
distinct
types
of
expenses
because
the
statute
specifically
permits
the
deduction
of
travel
expense,
but
it
does
not
permit
the
deduction
of
commuting
expense.
the
only
thing
necessary
to
clarify
that
particular
phase
of
the
problem
is
for
the
court
to
make
a
preliminary
determination
if
this
is,
is
or
not
commuting
expense
and
no
one
is
arguing
that
commuting
expenses
should
be
deductible.
they
have
never
been
treated
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
they
have
been
labeled
personal
and
it's
to
pointed
out
in
brief,
i
think,
that
this
was
an
unfortunate
and
a
fact
to
which
contributes
to
the
confusion
here
because
by
classifying
commuting
expense
of
this
person
and
then
analogizing
commuting
to
travel
expense,
you
get
this
word
“personal”
brought
back
in
to
the
picture
improperly.
it
then
obscures
the
element
of
choice,
which,
i
think,
is
the
fundamental
issue
in
all
of
these
cases
whether
or
not
these
expenses
result
from
the
personal
choice
of
a
taxpayer
or
required
by
the
needs
of
his
business.
our
people
have
homes.
they're
--
they
tried
to
--
to
stabilize
their
families,
they
have
their
children
in
school,
all
of
these
factors,
and
there
are
away
from
home
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
and
on
that
point,
one
further
thing,
section
24
requires
an
ascertainment
of
the
difference
between
a
personal
expense
and
a
business
expense.
it
does
not
require
an
ascertainment
of
the
difference
between
a
--
a
deductible
travel
expense
and
a
nondeductible
one.
this
is
a
matter
which
order
in
the
section
--
the
purview
of
section
23.
section
23
says
expenses
that
are
ordinary
and
necessary
are
deductible.
it
does
not
permit
all
business
expenses
as
deduction.
so
the
theory
of
24
is
to
distinguish
between
business
and
personal
expenses.
the
function
of
23
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
particular
travel
expense
is
or
is
not
deductible
by
meeting
the
three
requirements
which
this
court
has
established.
now,
under
this
rationale
of
stating
that
an
expense
is
personal
because
it
is
already
been
decided
to
be
nondeductible,
section
24
is
then
emasculated
and
becomes
nonfunctional
because
the
result
has
already
been
previously
determined
under
23
so
by
this
one
theory,
one
principle
of
saying
home
is
where
you
work,
23
is
in
the
sense
rendered
nonfunctional
and
24,
both,
are
rendered
non-functional.
at
that
point,
then
the
so-called
exception
comes
into
the
picture
and
the
entire
legal
controversy
revolves
around
what
is
temporary
and
what
is
indefinite
and
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
they
--
that
theory
is
completely
out
from
--
on
the
both
statutes.
it's
running
free.
it's
fabricating
its
loss
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
not.
i
think
that
the
wallace
case
was
the
last
clear
expression
on
that
in
the
circuit.
most
of
the
cases
have
--
in
the
circuits
have
began
to
fall
in
with
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
in
this
matter.
we
think
they
are
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
your
honor,
as
--
as
i'm
arguing
today.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
resolving
this
matter.
when
the
taxpayers
in
these
cases
went
to
the
tax
court
carrying
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
commissioner's
determination
was
incorrect,
they
produce
nothing
to
show
that
their
employment
on
the
dupont
project
was
not
of
indefinite
duration.
now,
the
evidence
here,
again,
the
evidence
that
they
are
referring
to
is
evidence
requiring
--
regarding
a
requirement
under
23
not
a
requirement
under
24
and
yet
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
--
the
--
the
personal
choice
factor
is
the
very
vital
factor
involved
here
and
i
say
that
this
is
a
factual
determination.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
there
was
a
finding
to
that
effect,
your
honor
and
we
maintain
that
--
that
even
under
the
theory
that
respondent
advocates
that
we
have
factually
met
our
burden
of
proof.
in
other
words,
i
am
arguing
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
alternative.
i'll
argue
first
that
the
theory
is
erroneous.
and
second,
that
even
if
the
theory
is
adopted,
our
facts
qualify
even
under
the
commissioner's
theory
itself,
that
we
have
sustained
our
burden
of
proving
that
this
work
was
temporary
in
nature.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
your
honor,
that
i
think,
again
is
a
misconception.
there
are
--
there
are
two
rebuttals
to
that.
first,
this
court,
in
commissioner
versus
flowers
laid
down
the
rule
and
in
its
substantive
--
may
i
read
that
language
to
you,
sir?
to
reach
the
--
to
state
categorically,
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
my
opinion.
this
court
said,
“the
expense
must
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
--
requirement
three.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i'm
reading
from
the
flowers
case,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
it's
page
33
in
my
--
in
my
brief
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
this
means
there
must
be
a
direct
connection
between
the
expenditure
and
the
carrying
on
of
the
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer
or
of
his
employee.
now,
there
--
there
is
a
further
rebuttal
for
that
position,
your
honor.
the
commissioner,
himself
has
issued
a
ruling
to
the
effect
that
that
was
no
long
--
that
that
was
not
a
proper
restriction
on
the
deductibility
of
travel
expenses.
in
his
ruling
issued
may
4th
which
was
in
regard
to
construction
workers,
he
said
this.
“thus,
flowers
decision
and
those
taking
a
similar
approach
to
the
extent
they
are
all
expenses
or
not
‘incurred
in
pursuit
of
business
because
the
employer
did
not
require
the
taxpayer
to
travel
in
order
to
perform
his
duties,
do
not
constitute
precedence
to
be
followed
in
determining
deductibility',”
and
so
forth.
now,
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
this
is
--
this
not
cited
in
brief,
your
honor.
this
is
a
ruling
of
which
there
are
great
many.
i'm
reading
it
from
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
it
too
errors
in.
first
of
all,
he
said
this,
he
says
the
flowers
case
held
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
in
the
pursuit
of
the
employer's
business.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
but
it
does
not
hold
and
second
he
says
the
flowers
case
held
and
then
he
says
our
brush
has
found
the
flowers
case,
he
says
that
do
not
constitute
precedence,
referring
to
the
flowers
case.
in
other
words,
first,
he
misquotes
flowers
and
then
when
he
--
when
he
--
his
position
can't
be
sustained,
he
says
that
flowers
doesn't
control
any,
is
the
way
i
interpret
his
position
in
his
own
ruling.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not
--
i
think,
it
--
it's
very
difficult
to
get
in
an
official
publication,
but
i
am
reading
it
as
--
as
an
appendix
to
h.r.
2680,

house
report
number
2680
and
it
appears
on
page
15,
close
to
the
bottom
of
the
page.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
other.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i
have
cited
this
in
my
brief.
there
--
there
were
a
number
of
--
there
are
just
numerous
of
these
rulings,
and
i
don't
believe
i
have
recalled
it.
but
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
it's
h.r.
2680,
85th
cong.,
2d.
--
2d.
sess.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
--
i
have
discussed
this
point
in
brief,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
believe
i
discussed
it
in
reference.
i
discussed
it
in
abstract
rather
than
in
reference
to
this
particular
citation.
now,
your
honor
will
permit,
there
are
some
other
cases
of
--
of,
i
would
say
rather
extreme
judicial
and
administrative
legislation.
i
like
to
refer
to
the
fact
in
the
whitaker
case.
james
r.
whitaker
was
an
engineer
who
has
a
home
in
iowa
and
he
--
in
his
employment
with
a
new
york
construction
firm
that
we
had
a
contract
with
the
army
that
his
employment
carried
him
to
thule,
greenland
and
his
employment
was
an
offshore
construction.
now,
whitaker
worked
in
greenland
a
total
of
222
days
for
the
taxable
year
in
controversy
today.
he
returned
to
the
states
twice
during
that
222
day
period
and
the
court
said
there,
“your
work
is
indefinite
and
you
are
not
entitled
to
travel
expense
deduction.”
this
--
this
need
marks
the
outer
boundaries
of
extremity
in
denying
his
deduction.
i
would
also
like
to
refer
to
the
fact
in
the
instant
case.
in
the
instant
case,
petitioner's
assignment
was
conceded
to
have
deductible
expenses
in
regard
to
his
employment
in
charleston
and
in
regards
to
his
employment
at
fort
bragg.
and
one
of
his
employments
lasted
three
weeks,
as
i
recall,
and
the
other,
seven
and
a
half.
but
petitioner's
assignment
was
following
the
same
pattern
of
working
and
living
throughout
the
entire
year.
his
relationship
to
his
employer
was
the
same.
the
manner
by
which
he
obtained
his
work
was
the
same.
substantially,
there
was
no
difference
in
his
employment
in
any
way.
the
commissioner
has
not
argued
that
these
are
--
do
not
give
rise
to
deductible
expenses
yet
he
argued
at
the
same
time
that
his
employment
at
--
at
kinston
does
not
give
rise
to
this
deduction.
one
further
thing
before
i
leave
what
i
can
say
--
what
i
am
specifying
here
as
illustration
of
--
of
legislation
outside
this
statute.
in
this
very
case,
there
is
considerable
reference
to
the
fact
that
my
petitioners
quit
the
employment
on
some
of
these
occasions
and
the
--
the
apparent
logic
in
this
is
that
petitioners
could
have
work
longer.
if
they
had
worked
longer,
then
their
work
would
have
become
indefinite
and
indefinite
employment
does
not
give
rise
to
travel
expenses
therefore,
they
are
denied
this
deduction
because
they
quit
the
employment.
now,
this
adds
a
complete
new
requirement
for
deductibility
that
so
far
as
i
know
is
new
in
this
case
and
i
think
that,
while
i'm
not
going
to
dwell
on
the
constitutional
aspect,
if
--
if
the
tax
laws
of
the
country
are
going
to
be
interpreted
in
such
a
manner
that
the
fact
that
a
man
quits
his
job,
results
in
a
denial
of
--
of
the
deduction
that
he
would
otherwise
be
entitled
to,
i
say
there
is
a
grave
question
there
of
infringing
his
right
or
infringing
the
thirteenth
amendment
regarding
his
involuntary
servitude
and
it
is
pointed
in
brief
but
are
not
directly
in
point.
in
the
opinion
of
these
cases,
the
language
of
the
court
there
says
that
a
man
had
a
right,
an
unqualified
right
to
terminate
his
employment
and
i
think
that
this
throws
the
strong
shadow
over
that
right
because
he
puts
a
--
a
taxpayer
in
a
position
of
having
to
stop
and
consider
very
seriously
if
he
can
terminate
his
employment
without
loosing
his
tax
deduction.
now,
the
cases
have
--
are
--
are
falling
into
the
constant
theme
of
the
cases
in
the
tax
couth
and
the
circuit
now
is
temporary
versus
indefinite.
and
this
thing
is
called
an
exemption
and
i
would
like
to
read
respondent's
language
as
to
this
exception.
he
said
this
exception
is
ameliorated
in
nature
and
is
apparently
based
on
the
theory
that
it
is
inequitable
to
call
the
post
the
duty
to
tax
home
if
the
taxpayer
being
there
only
temporarily
is
forced
by
economic
circumstances
to
maintain
elsewhere.
what
--
my
objection
to
this
is
that
if
you
accept
as
valid,
the
principle
that
a
man's
home
is
where
he
works,
then
the
little
application
denies
all
taxpayers
to
travel
expense
then
the
only
thing
that
becomes
valid
is
what
is
here
called
an
exception.
and
i
think
it's
difficult
to
find
a
more
--
clearer
repudiation
of
the
original
principle
than
--
than
this
so-called
exception
which
he
says
is
ameliorated
in
nature
and
is
apparently
based
on
the
theory
that
he
says
is
--
is
equitable
in
nature.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
to
my
mind,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
every
child
understands
that
home
is
home
and
if
i
may
read
one
further
thing
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
it
has
because
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
to
my
mind,
nothing,
your
honor.
and
i
maintain
that
the
statute
should
be
put
back
on
the
books
as
written.
now,
because
of
the
expiration
of
my
time
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
if
i
--
excuse
me.
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
mean
that
the
word
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i
have
argued
very
strong
all
through
this
that
the
flowers
case
is
correct,
that
the
flowers
case
is
based
on
these
three
requirements.
the
--
the
denial
of
deduction
here
was
not
based
on
a
failure
to
meet
any
requirement
in
flowers,
except
that
you
interpret
away
from
home
as
being
away
in
florida.
the
stipulated
facts
show
that
my
people
are
away
from
home,
you
honor.
the
stipulated
facts
show
that
they
were
away
from
home.
and
in
flowers
case,
they
said
that
this
decision
was
a
factual
determination
and
the
facts
as
stipulated
would
show
that
my
people
are
away
from
home.
and
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
the
one
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
that
question.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
oh,
on
the
basis
of
the
fact,
i
think
the
flowers
case
brings
a
factual
determination
that
these
expenses
were
--
were
incurred
there
as
a
result
of
the
personal
choice
of
the
taxpayer.
that
involved
an
attorney
who
had
been
retained
by
railroad
but
did
not
want
to
move
his
office
to
the
--
to
the
railroad's
main
office.
he
kept
his
home
the
way
it
had
been
before
and
conducted
his
affairs
from
there.
that
clearly
met
the
factual
determination
or
sufficient
facts
for
the
court
to
reach
that
result
that
this
was
personal
in
fact
and
once
that
determination
had
been
reached,
then,
actually,
the
--
the
expense
became
nondeductible
under
section
24
immediately.
although
the
court
didn't
--
didn't
place
it
under
section
24,
they
said
you
fail
to
meet
requirements
one
or
one
and
three
which
is
failure
to
be
ordinary
and
necessary
and
failure
to
be
required
by
the
expenses
of
the
business.
in
our
case,
respondent's
theory
conceives
we
have
met
requirements
one
and
three.
this
is
an
enormous
difference.
there
the
result
stems
from
the
theory,
the
substance
in
all
theory
that
where
you
work
is
your
home.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
in
the
flowers
case,
he
was
retained
his
general
counsel
by
railroad,
but
he
did
not
want
to
move
his
home
to
the
office
of
the
railroad.
he
kept
his
home
where
--
where
it
was
and
then
sought
to
deduct
his
expenses.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
back
and
forth.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
i
don't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
say
this
that
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
the
court
so
found
that
was
a
matter
of
personal
choice
on
those
facts,
but
i
say
this,
there
was
facts
there.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
it
--
i
don't
think
so,
under
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
facts,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case,
the
nature
of
my
peoples'
work
is
such
that
--
factual
determination
that
they
were
requiring
this
as
a
matter
of
personal
choice
doesn't
follow.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
they
had
to
live,
this
is
their
trade.
they
follow
heavy
construction.
if
they're
going
to
live,
they
--
the
procedure
is
this.
they
have
a
local
union
that
they
go
to
for
references
and
they
maintain
home
adjacent
to
this
local
union
headquarter.
when
work
is
available
near
home,
they
sent
near
home.
when
work
is
not
available
near
home,
they
take
the
closest
thing
they
can
get.
when
the
work
is
over,
they
return
home
and
this
is
the
--
the
factual
pattern
that
these
men
follow.
they
come
home
at
every
opportunity
that
they
can
and
get
work
near
home
but
someone
has
to
move
when
construction
work
is
involved.
it's
--
it's
necessary.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
they
don't
have
to
go
to
a
number
of
different
places.
they
get
their
reference
from
their
union
and
when
they
go
there,
they
are
actually
put
on,
but
they
--
their
heads
are
counted
in
advance
if
they're
going
there
and
the
actual
retention
of
the
employment
is
consummated
at
the
construction
site.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
they
know
that
when
they
go,
the
work
cannot
last
beyond
the
length
of
the
construction
job
and
for
many
--
other
reasons,
it
may
be
terminated
properly.
i
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
first
thing
that
i
want
to
offer
vigorous
dispute
with
is
the
position,
the
asserted
position
that
we
--
we
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
how
long
the
work
last
and
how
many
are
entitled
to
the
deduction.
that
is
not
our
position.
what
we
do
say
is
this,
that
irrespective
of
the
length
of
the
employment
that
that
is
a
fact
we
should
be
taking
into
consideration
in
evaluating
the
necessity
of
the
travel.
and
further,
that
if
the
--
if
the
employment
has
met
the
requirements
of
being
ordinary
and
necessary
required
by
the
exigencies
of
the
trade
or
business
that
the
duration
alone
should
not
deprive
our
taxpayers
of
this
deduction
in
the
absence
of
some
extraordinary
factors.
the
point
is
that
our
people
are
trying
to
maintain
stabilized
homes
just
like
everyone
else.
they
have
to
incur
the
double
expense
which
is
the
heart
of
the
matter
and
the
expense
would
not
be
incurred.
likely,
it
is
--
it
is
an
automatic
deterrent
and
the
tax
benefit
does
not
put
in
back
in
pocket,
it
only
reduces
the
burden
he
--
he's
having
anyway.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
you
mean
in
the
same
community
where
he
just
finished
his
employment?
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
don't
think
so
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
at
that
point,
the
question
of
him
--
of
it
being
reasonable
for
him
to
say
that
he
should
maintain
his
home
where
he
originally
came
from
would
--
would
change
the
complexion
of
the
thing.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
think
that
under
our
factual
circumstances,
he
would,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
there,
the
uncertainties
of
this
employment,
when
you
use
our
hypothesis
two
years,
this
is
looking
at
it
at
the
back
end,
but
this
construction
work
can
be
brought
to
a
sudden
termination
by
any
one
of
the
multitude
of
factors.
they
take
a
job.
they
may
be
there
a
week,
they
may
be
there
several
weeks
or
in
--
on
a
few
jobs
that
run
into
a
year.
under
those
circumstances,
it's
not
reasonable
to
expect
our
people
to
keep
moving
their
homes
around
and
force
them
to
become
transient.
and
they're
talking
about
quitting
the
work
as
being
a
matter
of
personal
choice.
but
all
--
all
people
quit
their
work
as
a
matter
of
personal
choice,
but
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
it's
reasonable
and
necessary
at
the
beginning
of
the
employment
for
them
to
undertake
this
travel.
and
further,
referring
to
these
suppositions
about
working
beside
one
man
who
has
a
home
in
kinston
and
--
excuse
me,
yes,
a
man
who
has
a
home
in
kinston
is
not
entitled
to
the
deduction
and
our
petitioners
who
live
in
wilmington
are
entitled
to
it.
but
that's
the
identical
situation
the
statute
created
deduction
for
because
in
one
case,
the
man
has
two
homes
and
another
case,
he
only
has
one.
and
this
is
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
no,
this
--
excuse
me.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
this
is
a
permanent
home.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
think
that
this
would
have
to
be
an
individual
determination,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
can
answer
in
--
in
abstract.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
i
think
--
i
think
if
that
fact
were
--
were
developed,
i
think
that
it
would
certainly
destroy
the
ordinary
and
necessary
character
of
this
travel.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
the
way
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
--
your
honor,
i
think
he
has
to
carry
the
burden
that
the
statute
imposed
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
--
or
vested.
the
--
the
statute
says
there
must
be
three
requirements
in
this
court
and
said
they
must
be
factual.
and
i
think
that
in
every
case,
that's
true
and
--
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
really
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
--
i
would
be
afraid
to
say.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
they
were
building
the
dupont
plant
there,
sir.
dupont
plant,
i
don't
know
just
what
they
were
making.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
he
was
living
just
out
of
wilmington,
north
carolina
and
the
brief
shows
the
exact
distance,
i
think
it
was
some
hundred
miles
away
from
his
home.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
wilmington,
i
think
i
could
have
that
that's
probably
around
35,000
or
40,000
in
kinston.
i
think
would
much
smaller
community.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
he
was
either
the
pipe
fitter
or
welder.
i
forget
which
is
which.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
they
have
to
take
what's
available,
your
honor.
and
this
is
a
customary
practise
in
the
trade.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
the
--
the
established
(inaudible)
of
the
man's
employment
shows
that
he
did,
when
he
got
to
the
job
he
went
back
home.
he
picked
up
another
one
and
showed
in
his
itinerary
employment
right
near
his
home.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
he
went
right
back.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
i
think
the
fact
speaks
for
itself,
your
honor.
he
went
back,
that
shows
his
intent,
he
went
back.
obviously,
he
intended
to
go
back.
he
went
back
right
to
the
same
unit
and
got
a
new
record.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
i
don't
know
in
that
particular
one
but
i
--
i
assume
that
the
job
has
ended
or
he
quit,
but
he
could
have
terminated
this
for
--
for
--
i
mean
that
could
have
terminated
his
employment
either
way.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
i
think,
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
i
think
that
you
--
that
you
are
quite
right,
but
i
say
this.
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
review
of
the
facts
and
to
the
personal
nature
of
this
work.
they
sustained
--
they
--
they
overrule
as
--
now
on
the
basis
of
the
determination
of
the
facts
but
on
a
theory
that
home
is
where
you
work.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
they
allege
--
they
allege
by
their
own
words.
they
determine
that
the
--
that
there
was
no
evidence
have
of
indefinite
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
--
to
give
facts
on
the
point
of
law.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well
--
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
your
honor,
i
-
i
can't
speak
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
i
--
i
can't
say
anything
there.
what
the
court
wishes
to
do,
of
course,
is
in
its
own
domain.
i
have
to
keep
silent
on
that
point.
mr.
daniel
r.
dixon
well,
i
won't
comment
on
that
point
either.
my
time
is
up
your
honor.[laughter]
