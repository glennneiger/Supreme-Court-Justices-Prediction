justice

frankfurter
i
read
only
the
other
day
that
they
implore
that
one
person
in
five
changes
his
home
in
the
united
states
and
both
having
been
as
commentary
on
stability
of
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
life
is
so
fantastic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
for
or
against
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
for
or
against
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
stabilized
homes
â€“
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
did
much,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
simply
that
traveling
expenses
imply
the
shuttling
process,
and
if
there's
any
kind
of
permanence
and
what
is
permanent
is
not
something
you
can
get
an
answer
to
that,
putting
a
nickel
in
the
slot
machine,
as
against
some
kind
of
stability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
whole
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pollock,
could
you
give
me
a
piece
of
information?
what
was
the
ground
for
--
whereas
an
apartment
in
new
york
city,
say
the
bronx
(inaudible)
or
new
york
manufacturers
and
his
territory
or
neighboring
towns
in
connecticut
and
he
takes
his
car
everyday
to
his
connecticut
territory
in
the
morning
and
comes
back
in
the
evening,
can
he
deduct
the
gas
he
consumes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
he
deduct
it
if
his
territory
are
the
five
boroughs
of
new
york
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
while
away
from
home
--
what
does
--
what
does
that
mean
physically
away
from
the
place
where
he
lives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
come
under
this.
he
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
be
away
from
home
in
that
sense,
would
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
understand
that,
but
the
notion
for
meal
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
implies
that
he
lodges
away
from
home,
doesn't
it,
but
that
is
necessary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
really
saying
that
the
question
before
us
is
not
at
all
a
question
of
construing
the
tax
statute
but
the
question
before
us
is
whether
we
can
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
so
obviously
wrong
in
interpreting
what
the
findings
of
fact
were
in
finding
that
they
were
not
supported
by
the
evidence
that
this
court
to
keep
the
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
really
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
--
is
it
--
is
it
bad
to
say
that
the
issue
before
the
court
as
an
issue
of
law
is
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
the
distinction
between
temporary
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
this
evidence
no
matter
(inaudible)
the
facts,
what
facts
be
it
in
one
or
the
other
tax
evasion.
now,
that
is
--
that
would
be
a
question
of
law
from
any
(inaudible)
can
be
made
but
as
i
understand
that
that
is
not
an
issue
before
us.
what
is
in
issue
before
us
is
the
determination
of
a
specific
set
of
facts
on
which
the
tax
court
made
one
determination
and
the
court
of
appeals
another
and
we're
not
to
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
clearly
erroneous
in
finding
that
the
tax
court
was
clearly
erroneous,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
(inaudible)
that
you
hypothesized
a
unique
situation
in
this
country
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
common
one,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
like
--
that
open
before
the
tax
court?
i
should
think
that
--
that
would
really
open
a
door
to
inquire
me
to
in
awfully
not
only
difficult
for
them
to
pass
on
but
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
and
eventually
hear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
greater
possibility
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dixon,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
case,
you
said
that
that
would
be
a
determination
in
each
specific
case,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
congress
has
allowed
mandatory
appellate
review
of
what
the
tax
court
did
at
the
court
of
appeals.
it
meant
that
the
government
or
the
taxpayers
as
a
matter
of
right
to
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
have
that
court
review
what
the
tax
court
did.
the
congress
did
just
the
opposite
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
it
didn't
mean
the
case
is
to
come
here
and
have
us
review
what
the
court
of
appeals
review
what
the
tax
court
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
it
doesn't
take
all
the
difference
in
the
world
that
we
are
sitting
here
to
decide
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
its
appraisal
of
what
the
tax
court
did.
this
court
wasn't
--
isn't
--
wasn't
meant
for
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
did
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
the
court
says
there's
no
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
tribunal
that
has
the
determination
of
finding
whether
this
is
evidence,
the
congress
of
united
states
didn't
mean
this
court
ought
to
consider
whether
the
appellate
court
had
any
basis
for
saying
there
was
no
evidence.
we
said
in
the
universal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
camera
case
that
this
court
ought
not
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
admiration
to
what
you
squeeze
out
of
this
case
as
--
if
i
may
say
so.
