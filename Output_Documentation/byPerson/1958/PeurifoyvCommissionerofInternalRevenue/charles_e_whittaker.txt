justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
can
(inaudible)
what
you
have
to
sat
about
(inaudible)
having
some
meaning
of
tax
home
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
is
it
home
that
you
were
working
from
a
different
place?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
home
is
actual
if
post
of
duty
meant
home.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
could
it
be
away?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
there
not
a
finding,
mr.
dixon
by
the
tax
court
that
the
service
was
temporary?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it
doesn't
hold.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
it
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
congress
or
anyone
to
compose
a
statue
in
plainer
words
than
this
section
23?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
why
shouldn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
ask
why
probably
and
improperly,
i
said
why
shouldn't?
it
seems
to
me
a
statute
would
say
this,
“all
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
paid
or
incurred
during
the
taxable
year
in
carrying
on
any
trade
of
business,
including
travelling
expenses
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business
are
deductible.”
now,
what's
ambiguous
or
uncertain
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
to
say
then
mr.
pollock
that
whether
the
exemption
shall
or
shall
not
be
allowed,
depends
upon
the
commissioner's
belief
whether
the
period
involved
is
a
little
more
or
a
little
less?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
in
context
of
it
in
the
statute
(inaudible)
didn't
they
say
that
all
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
in
a
taxable
year,
carrying
on
any
trade
or
business
including
travel
expenses
are
also
included
in
the
entire
amount
expended
from
(inaudible)
while
away
from
home
in
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business
are
deducted.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
perhaps
not.
in
(inaudible)
that
section
24
applies
to
the
residence
of
such
expenses
as
meals,
lodging,
etcetera
has
remained
after
the
application
of
section
23,
which
is
specific.
(inaudible)
what
23
provides
all
remaining
fall
under
24.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
--
do
you
--
i
am
just
asking
for
information
this
time.
do
you
think
that
congress
used
the
words
--
the
phrase
“away
from
home”
in
any
other
than
ordinary
generally
accepted
common
sense
of
the
purpose?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
think
it
is?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
was
into
that,
going
to
the
lawyers
as
well
as
the
workers.
