what
difference
it
were
though,
ranging
from
what
to
what?
justice

black
how
long
did
he
stay
there?
justice

l.
black
i
notice
that
peurifoy
was
32
--
he
was
20
miles
away
from
home.
justice

l.
black
that's
what
i
told
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
--
you
said
trial
court
here,
it's
the
tax
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
found
back
and
decided
it
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
different
state
where
they
work
on
these
jobs
as
i
understand
getting
over
to
the
states
didn't
come
back
as
long
as
they
were
here
when
they
seat
that
that's
down?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
as
i
observed
the
category
relating
to
traveling
salesman?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mind
giving
that
citation
again?
justice

black
when
you
say
--
justice

black
when
you
say
--
when
you
say
put
back
on
the
books
as
written
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
are
you
saying
that
the
flowers
case
is
wrong
and
should
be
overruled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
differentiation
you
find
between
the
two
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
differentiation
you
find
between
the
two
cases?
what
--
factually
speaking
from
the
operation
of
the
flowers
is
taxed
than
this
one,
what
are
the
factual
differences?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
differentiated
on
basis
of
personal
choice.
in
the
flowers
case,
the
man
had
to
go
to
mobile
to
keep
that
job,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
backwards
and
forwards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
makes
--
makes
it
as
a
personal
choice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
just
what
your
distinction
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn't
--
couldn't
they
find
that
here
that
it
was
a
matter
of
personal
choice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
wanted
that
job
if
the
other
--
those
jobs
with
the
other
places?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
have
to
go
to
a
number
of
different
places?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
draw
any
support
from
the
fact
that
this
man
went
to
mobile
for
a
permanent
job
and
he
knew
it
was
a
permanent
job,
while
these
people
go
to
different
localities
and
have
to
go
to
different
localities
in
order
to
get
any
job
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
pollock,
is
there
not
a
considerable
difference
in
saying
that
a
man's
home
should
be
considered
a
place
where
he
worked
permanently
all
the
time
and
where
all
of
his
duties
are
being
in
his
home
as
the
place
of
many
places
but
he
may
have
to
go
from
time
to
time
as
he
was?
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
difference
which
may
not
be
vital
between
this
and
the
flowers
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
--
that
was
the
case
here
in
flowers
case,
the
primary
place
of
duty.
in
fact,
he
has
practised
--
the
only
place
of
his
duty
was
in
mobile,
but
he
chose
to
live
out
of
mobile
then
sought
to
say
that
he
could
get
travelling
expenses
from
his
home.
and
under
those
circumstances,
they
held
that
the
word
“home”
in
that
statute
did
not
did
apply
--
did
apply
to
him
while
he
was
in
mobile
and
not
while
he
was
in
jackson.
but
here,
you
have
men
who
lived
at
one
place
and
he
get
that
job
from
one
point
right
around
and
radiate
out
from
time
to
time,
how
can
you
say
if
that
statute
in
any
case
has
ever
held
that
under
those
circumstances,
maybe
it
shouldn't
that
he's
at
home
every
time
he
goes
from
these
places
even
though
he
only
works
half
a
week
or
two
weeks
or
three
weeks?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
they
held
here,
as
--
as
i
understand,
the
facts
--
in
determining
those
facts
which
flowers
said
you
had
to
determine,
was
it
not,
that
these
people
were
not
at
home
in
these
places
where
they
work
and
on
this
temporary
construction
(inaudible)
was
that
not
determined
as
a
fact
by
the
tax
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
have
to
take
that
position
to
do
it
here.
why
isn't
it
enough
or
is
it
enough
or
if
it's
not
like
--
if
it's
not
enough,
the
tax
court
looking
at
it
and
seeing
at
the
variety
of
job
to
which
they
had
to
go
from
their
real
headquarters
which
is
at
their
home
and
where
their
union
is
that
the
tax
court
has
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
you
would
not
treat
the
--
the
job
as
their
home
if
you
would
consider
their
home
back
where
they
want
from.
have
they
not
held
that
in
this
case
and
who
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

to
decide
the
length
of
time
that
should
bring
in
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
on
which
you
had
noted
than
the
tax
court
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
then
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
they
have
--
do
they
have
to
do
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
to
prove
anything
like
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
if
--
if
it's
a
short
time,
the
difference
between
a
short
and
a
long
time,
the
taxpayer
and
to
have
his
home
considered
not
at
the
place
where
he
work
but
a
place
where
he
came
from.
now,
the
tax
court
here
has
held
then
that
these
times
were
so
short,
going
through
these
varieties
of
cases
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
home
was
not
where
he
went
to
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now,
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
better
to
decide
that
as
a
question
of
fact
as
we
said
in
flowers
in
the
tax
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
dobson
case
didn't
report
the
rule.
that
--
there
were
cases
in
which
the
matter
of
fact
would
be
accepted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't,
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
--
where
did
he
go
when
he
got
through?
he
has
to
go
back
to
some
place
to
live,
doesn't
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
he
may
have
stayed
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
it?
some
distance
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
distance
between
the
place
where
he
worked
on
the
construction
job
and
the
cottage
he
had
taking
him
as
an
example,
was
too
far
for
him
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
everyday,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
had
to
arrange
so
knowing
that
was
temporary
in
a
sense
not
permanent
like
the
railroad
job
there,
he
had
to
have
some
place
where
he
could
go
back
to
when
he
left.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
doing
now
is
challenging
the
finding
a
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
the
whole
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
the
other
people
here
were
married,
were
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
didn't
seem
it
to
a
long
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
gets
down
to
a
question
of
whether
the
tax
court
was
wrong
in
failing
to
find
that
they
left
for
personal
reasons
rather
than
to
--
because
it
was
necessary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
--
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
just
want
to
get
squarely
because
i
agree
with
the
flowers
decision
and
i
want
to
get
squarely
in
my
mind
what
this
case
is
and
what
that
one
was.
as
i
understand
this,
however,
the
government
wanted
this
case
for
the
tax
court
on
the
theory
that
they
could
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
things
were
--
in
some
of
these
instances
was
too
long
for
them
to
reach
a
conclusion
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
their
home
was
back
where
the
--
their
families
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
you
go
back
a
little
step
further,
there's
another
question
of
fact,
isn't
it,
whether
this
is
clearly
erroneous
depends
on
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
right
to
take
facts
decided
by
the
tax
court
and
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
looking
at
it,
there
was
no
just
plausible
support
their
decision
was
arbitrary
and
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided?
did
they
say
that,
anything
like
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
ahead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
population
of
kinston?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
construction
work
were
they
doing
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
where
was
this
man
living
you
say
that
his
home
was
permanent,
and
probably
referred
to
him
as
a
bachelor?
where
was
he
--

black
and
what's
the
population
of
wilmington?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
this
man's
particular
construction
skill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
--
your
assumption
is,
as
i
gather
it
is
that
he's
not
like
man
who
lived
in
the
city
like
new
york
where
it's
a
very
small
place
or
concentration
of
the
construction
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
the
man
to
get
a
job
anywhere
in
that
vicinity
had
to
go
around
for
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
--
you're
urging
that
they
should,
under
those
circumstances
be
treated
as
though
they
had
their
home
or
where
they
were
rather
than
temporary
places
of
their
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
about
the
20
and
a
half
months
though
when
a
man
stayed
there
that
long
and
what
do
you
say
to
his
argument
that
you
failed
to
prove
that
--
that
you
didn't
leave
for
personal
reason
rather
than
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
the
statement
is
that
record
is
parallel
to
evidence
to
show
that
he
didn't
do
that
just
because
he
wanted
