mr.
dixon,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
in
the
government's
brief?
i
see
counsel
is
--
is
replying
to
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
time
has
not
expired.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
pollock.
chief

warren
mr.
dixon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dixon,
suppose
at
the
end
of
this
20
and
a
half
months,
mr.
peurifoy
left
his
employment
(inaudible)
and
concluding
that
there
was
no
work
at
his
home,
he
took
another
job
of
similar
character
in
the
--
in
the
same
community,
would
he
still
be
entitled
to
his
expenses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
suppose
he
went
back
to
his
home
and
his
union
then
sent
him
to
another
part
of
the
country
and
where
he
would
be
employed
on
a
construction
job,
say,
for
another
two
years,
would
he
be
entitled
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
--
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
this,
where
would
you
draw
the
line
on
how
long
the
man
could
stay
away
when
he
has
successive
employers
and
he
has
a
summer
home
such
as
this
bachelor
had
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
let's
say
then
a
permanent
home
and
he
--
he
continues
to
takes
job
away
from
his
--
from
his
home.
how
many
times
could
he
do
that
and
how
long
could
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
would
the
court
have
--
tax
court
have
to
determine
whether
there
was
employment
open
to
him
in
this
--
in
the
community
where
he
lived
or
could
he
just
do
that
by
pre-choice,
say,
“well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
any
job
for
my
home.
i
want
to
go
to
ohio
or
west
virginia
or
some
other
place”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
must
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
must
the
commissioner
in
--
in
the
case
of
every
employer
who
--
who
claims
such
as
an
exempt
could
go
into
all
those
matters
or
they
could
get
employment
at
home
or
not?
or
does
the
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
