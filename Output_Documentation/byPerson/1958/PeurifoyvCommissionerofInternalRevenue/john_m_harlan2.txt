(inaudible)
statute?

there
is
not
â€“-
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
concepts
blend
together
in
some
extent,
don't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
there
been
any
division
among
the
courts
of
appeals
since
the
wallace
case
as
to
the
home
means
--
meaning
the
--
the
place
of
principle
employment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
know
nothing
wrong.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
escape
the
impact
of
the
third
requirement
in
the
flowers
case,
namely,
that
the
travel
has
to
be
pursuant
to
the
interest
of
the
employer?
it
has
to
be
on
the
employer's
business.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
in
your
brief
is
that
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
does
that
to?
is
that
in
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
means
that
the
commissioner
against
the
flowers
case
is
wrong,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
that
ruling?
could
you
give
us
a
reference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
giving
rise
to
an
awful
lot
of
litigation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
--
where
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
only
question,
isn't
it,
if
you
accept
--
want
to
accept
your
premises
to
what
the
meaning
of
home
and
the
clause,
the
exception
clause
worked
by
the
temporary
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
pure
question
of
fact,
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
as
the
lawyers
as
well
as
workers,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
construction
workers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
take
it,
that
you
--
the
commissioner
does
not
allow
deductions
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
in
--
in
the
case
of
temporary
employment,
it
would
(inaudible)
as
the
employee
and
the
taxpayers
(inaudible)
of
a
plumber
or
a
welder
or
whatever.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
justice
stewart
asked
you
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
--
your
answer?
do
you
mean
that
in
the
case
of
temporary
employment,
the
third
test
of
the
flowers
case
to
wit,
that
the
employment
must
be
--
be
travel
or
must
be
in
pursuance
of
the
employer's
business
is
not
applicable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
recognize
it?
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
take
that
position
as
more
than
you
conceded
in
your
brief
and
i'm
just
interested.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
sweep
of
that
concession,
if
we
choose
to
call
it
that,
their
point
of
view
is
not
limited
to
construction
workers.
it
goes
across
the
board
for
any
temporary
employment
where
the
--
the
employment
is
found
to
be
temporary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
mean
in
this
case
that
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
you,
i'm
not
suggesting
myself
(inaudible)
would
disagree
with
the
view
that
home
means
principle
place
of
employment,
then
the
decision
should
be
reversed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
should
be
--
should
be
--
should
be
reversed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
--
your
point
should
win.
in
other
words,
if
home
means
actual
home
and
not
home
of
the
principle
place
of
employment,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
in
view
of
your
concession
in
these
temporary
employment
cases,
the
third
requirement
of
flowers
to
wit
that
the
--
that
the
travel
has
to
be
pursuant
to
the
employer's
business.
that,
being
out
of
the
case,
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
it
would
fall
on
that
premise
that
the
taxpayer
ought
to
win
here.
