mr.
earl
e.
pollock
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court
this
matter
is
involved
in
the
deductibility
of
certain
travel
expenses
of
construction
workers.
i
would
like
to
read
the
questions
involved
from
the
brief.
where
petitioner
has
entered
upon
certain
construction
employment
away
from
their
established
residences
prior
to
the
taxable
year
for
periods
lasting
in
approximately
20
1/2
months,
12
1/2
months,
and
8
1/2
months
respectively
and
terminated
such
employment
during
the
taxable
year,
the
question
is
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
the
amount
expended
during
taxable
year
of
board
and
lodge
while
so
employed
as
construction
worker
at
or
near
the
construction
site
and
for
transportation
expenses
to
return
to
their
respective
residences
upon
the
termination
of
such
employment,
are
non-deductible
expenses
within
the
provisions
of
section
24
(a)
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
and
if
it
is
determined
that
said
expenditures
are
not
personal
within
the
provision
of
section
24
(a)
(1),
a
further
question
was
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
the
expenses
in
question
are
deductible
under
the
provisions
of
section
24
(a)
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
as
amended.
these
two
sections,
section
23
and
section
24,
i
would
like
to
read,
“in
computing
net
income
there
shall
be
allowed
as
deductions
-
(a)
expenses;
(1)
trade
or
business
expenses;
(a)
in
general
all
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
paid
or
incurred
during
a
taxable
year,
traveling
expenses,
including
the
entire
amount
expended
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business;
and
section
24
-
general
rule;
in
computing
net
income,
no
deductions
shall
in
any
case
be
allowed
in
respect
to
personal,
living
or
family
expenses.
a
summary
of
the
facts;
there
are
three
petitioners
involved
and
the
respective
periods
of
employment
set
forth
in
the
question,
8
1/2
months,
12
1/2
months,
and
20
1/2
months
respectively.
each
of
these
petitioners
had
a
fixed
residence
for
the
entire
year
in
controversy.
each
of
the
petitioners
is
a
construction
worker.
each
obtained
his
employment
through
his
union
local.
each
belongs
to
the
united
association
of
journeymen
and
apprentices
of
a
plumbing
and
pipe
fitting
industry
of
the
united
states
and
canada,
hereafter
referred
to
as
the
union.
the
same
hiring
procedures
were
followed
in
respect
to
all
the
employments
of
the
various
petitioners.
a
construction
site
is
a
place
of
limited
employment
for
all
construction
workers
both
employees
and
employers.
by
its
very
nature
it
must
end
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time.
construction
work
by
its
nature
depends
upon
increasing
the
local
supply
of
skilled
labor
by
bringing
in
workers
from
various
parts
of
the
country.
the
journeymen
and
craftsman
normally
work
on
several
construction
sites
in
the
course
of
the
year.
some
jobs
on
rare
occasions
last
several
years,
but
normally
the
jobs
last
a
matter
weeks
or
months.
turning
to
petitioner
peurifoy,
petitioner
peurifoy
was
saying
he
lived
in
his
own
home
that
he
had
built
personally
which
is
located
at
kure
beach,
north
carolina.
his
union
local
was
located
about
20
miles
away
in
the
city
of
wilmington,
north
carolina,
local
number
329.
his
practice
of
work
was
to
obtain
work
through
his
union
local
for
an
area
as
close
as
he
usually
could
to
his
home.
he
returned
--
when
work
was
not
immediately
available
near
his
home,
he
would
take
work
wherever
the
union
could
find
employment
and
would
return
to
his
home
on
weekends.
his
work
itinerary
is
set
more
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
it
involved
about
six
jobs
which
lasted
from
one
week
to
20
1/2
months,
covering
about
a
four-year
period.
petitioner
stines
was
married
with
one
child.
he
owned
his
home
in
raleigh,
north
carolina
in
the
sense
that
he
was
purchasing
his
home
in
raleigh.
his
wife
and
child
lived
in
his
home
for
the
entire
year,
1953,
which
is
the
union
controversy.
petitioner
stines
worked
out
of
raleigh.
his
union
local,
number
725,
was
located
in
raleigh.
his
practice
of
obtaining
work
was
very
--
it
was
identical
to
the
general
practice
of
peurifoy.
he
would
--
would
contact
his
union
local
for
work
and
he
would
then
take
work
as
close
to
his
home
as
possible
and
when
such
work
was
not
available,
he
would
take
it
at
more
distant
locations.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
some
of
these
employments
would
range
as
far
away
as
from
raleigh,
north
carolina
they
would
range
the
rest
as
to
south
carolina,
charleston.
most
of
them
were
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
on
one
occasion
one
of
these
petitioners
went
as
far
away
as
barberton,
ohio.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
he
stayed
there
one
week
your
honor.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that
was
his
union
local
your
honor,
that
was
not
his
place
of
employment.
in
other
words,
his
--
his
home
was
physically
located
20
miles
from
the
headquarters
of
the
union
local.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
thank
you.
now,
petitioner
stines,
his
employment
itinerary
involved
about
30
jobs
which
lasted
from
two
weeks
to
12
1/2
months
over
about
a
four-year
period.
during
the
taxable
year
he
was
employed
at
charleston,
south
carolina,
in
fort
bragg,
north
carolina
for
periods
of
three
weeks
and
seven
and
a
half
weeks
respectively.
now,
the
commissioner
has
conceded
that
expenses
which
were
incurred
in
respect
to
his
employments
at
charleston
and
fort
bragg
were
deductible.
in
respect
to
petitioner
hall,
petitioner
hall,
the
situation
was
very
similar
to
that
of
petitioner
stines.
he
was
married
with
three
children.
he
was
--
purchasing
his
home
in
raleigh
and
his
wife
and
children
resided
in
this
home
during
the
entire
year
of
1953.
petitioner
hall
was
also
a
member
of
local
725,
located
in
raleigh.
his
employment
itinerary,
as
set
forth
in
the
brief,
involved
about
nine
jobs,
lasting
two
weeks
to
eight
and
a
half
months
over
a
four-year
period.
now,
the
petitioners
make
their
first
point
at
this
stage
in
this
respect.
we
brought
them
out
--
position
on
this
contention
that
these
facts
which
are
not
all
the
facts
by
any
means
ably
support
the
trial
court's
decision
and
that
the
principle
is
a
well-established
law
that
the
tax
rule
determinations
of
a
trial
court
are
not
being
upset
by
an
appellate
action.
the
second
contention
of
petitioners
is
this,
that
the
results
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
are
bottomed
solely
on
the
doctrine
which
we
maintain
is
erroneous
that
home
is
synonymous
with
post
of
duty
and
this
is
the
heart
of
this
matter
as
the
one
that
requires
full
amplification.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
tax
court,
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor
at
the
trial
court
here.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
they
decided
in
our
favor.
they
held
--
they
held
that
these
expenses
were
not
personal
and
they
held
further
--
and
the
work
was
temporary
and
that
--
that
all
taxpayers
were
entitled
to
this
deduction.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there
is
no
such
concept
under
the
statute.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
i
intend
to
develop
that
in
full
your
honor.
there
is
no
such
and
that
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
one
of
our
major
contentions
in
this
regard.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well
i'm
certainly
glad
you
asked
that
question
your
honor.
that
is
a
thing
that
i'm
moving
into
at
the
moment.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
heart
of
this
matter
is
section
23
and
i'm
going
to
use
abbreviated
language
if
the
court
will
permit
in
section
24.
now
section
23
says
this,
“you
can
deduct
family
expenses
away
from
home
in
a
pursuit
of
a
trade.”
this
is
a
positive
thing
in
that
it
creates
a
deduction.
now
section
24
says
you
cannot
deduct
personal
expenses.
now
your
honor,
to
my
mind,
this
entire
matter
comes
to
rest
on
two
words.
the
meaning
of
the
--
word
“home”
in
section
23
and
the
meaning
of
the
word
“personal”
in
section
24,
that
is
all.
the
entire
matter
has
been
a
subject
of
confusion
and
controversy
for
over
30
years
in
the
courts
and
basically
i
think
it's
very
simple.
to
begin
with,
in
the
90-day
letter
which
is
the
foundation
for
disallowance
of
this
deduction
there
was
one
ground
and
one
ground
only
that
petitioner
alleged
as
a
basis
for
denial.
he
said
these
expenses
are--
are
personal.
that
is
a
section
24
matter
exclusively.
he
said
these
expenses
are
personal,
that's
all.
now,
the
respondent
in
his
brief
in
the
summary
of
the
argument
has
bought
him
in
my
opinion,
his
entire
case
on
his
position
that
the
petitioner's
expenses
were
not
incurred
away
from
home.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
significance
of
home
is
a
section
23
matter.
it
has
nothing
to
do
on
the
face
of
it
and
we
will
--
i'll
maintain
it
has
nothing
to
do
in
actuality
with
section
24
regarding
personal.
and
the
--
the
commissioner's
statement
in
his
brief
is
this,
in
the
commissioner's
view
the
taxpayers
here
are
not
entitled
to
the
deduction
claimed
as
traveling
expenses
because
they
were
not
incurred
away
from
home.
now
something
has
got
to
be
wrong
on
face
of
it
when
the
commissioner
in
his
brief
is
saying
that
these
expenses
are
not
deductible
because
they're
away
from
home
and
the
commissioner's
90-day
letter
saying
they're
not
deductible
because
they're
personal.
now
this
--
this
result
comes
about
by
this
doctrine
that
your
honor
referred
to
as
home
being
equivalent
to
post
of
duty.
and
on
the
face
of
it,
the
deduction
arises
only
if
you
are
away
from
home.
you
must
be
away
from
home
or
there
is
no
basis
for
deduction.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
what
the
statute
says.
now
this
doctrine
which
has
been
plaguing
these
things
since
1927
and
got
started
in
the
–
whitaker
case
says
this.
it
says,
“where
you
work
is
your
home.”
now
gentlemen
--
excuse
me
your
honor
at
that
point
logic,
my
logic
is
shot.
how
can
you
possibly
have
a
statute
that
says,
“you
can
deduct
expense
away
from
home
and
then
say
that
the
word
home
means
where
you
work.
literally,
it's
self-annihilating
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
possibility
of
being
away
from
such
a
home
as
defined
by
the
respondent's
statute,
it
cannot
exist.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
it's
even
more
fantastic
enough
your
honor.
yes,
literally
you
would
always
be
away
from
home
and
i
have
maintained
in
my
brief.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it's
strapped
to
your
back
is
the
way
i
expressed
it
and
you
cannot
escape
your
home.
in
their
brief
respondents
even
went
so
far
as
to
concede
that
my
petitioners
had
a
tax
home
at
raleigh
and
wilmington.
being
away
from
this
taxed
home.
and
the
word
“taxed
home”
should
be
in
quotes
because
it
is
a
word
of
unsettled
meaning
at
this
moment,
but
they
conceded
that
we
had
tax
home
at
wilmington
and
raleigh,
but
this
wasn't
enough.
their
argument
was
that
our
homes
have
been
shifted
to
where
we
work.
that
makes
an
impossible
burden
on
the
taxpayer.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
i
hadn't
going
into
that
particular
phase
of
it.
except
this,
i'm
going
make
this
generalization
in
my
argument.
i'm
going
to
make
the
generalization
that
it's
more
desirable
that
it
almost
destabilized
than
if
they'd
be
--
they'd
that
--
if
you
moved
frequently.
and
i
intend
to
bring
that
in
as
a
part
of
the
effect
of
this
doctrine
is
--
is
to
increase
the
shifting
of
homes
under
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
pardon?
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
am
for
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
am
for
stabilized
homes.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
and
i
think
that
--
that
the
act
of
the
commissioner
in
denying
this
deduction
forces
my
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
anti-social
and
i
--
i
have
so
argued
in
my
brief
your
honor
that
it
--
it
forces
my
people
to
become
migrants
and
--
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
like
that.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
your
honor
i
have
to
speak
for
north
carolina,
but
i'm
certain
that
north
carolina
could
impose
such
tax
on
them
because
north
carolina
imposes
its
income
tax
on
the
two
different
theories,
the
theory
of
residence
and
the
theory
of
income
earned
within
the
state
and
north
carolina
does
impose
the
income
tax
on
these
people.
i
couldn't
speak
beyond
that,
another
burden
and
i'm
--
i'm
fairly
certain
that
under
the
constitutional
ground
for
taxing
income
that
this
burden
could
levied
in
every
state
if
it
saw
fit
to
do
so
and
now
i
speak
that
merely
as
a
personal
opinion.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
extent
of
state
taxation.
as
i
pointed
out
this
--
this
doctrine
erases
in
effect
section
23.
it
--
it
nullifies,
it
gives
--
it
gives
a
commissioner,
once
this
doctrine
is
applied
the
commissioner
then
--
i
don't
know
how
to
make
this
expression
exactly
but
has
the
taxpayer
within
his
power
because
from
that
moment,
the
commissioner's
position
is
out
from
under
the
statute.
the
statute
does
no
longer
apply
and
the
only
question
then
is,
is
this.
do
you
apply
this
doctrine
or
not?
if
you
apply
the
doctrine
denial
is
then
immediate
and
automatic.
no
inquiry
into
the
fact
is
necessary
--
never.
now
there
may
be
a
factual
inquiry
as
to
determine
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
apply
the
doctrine,
but
if
the
doctrine
is
applied,
or
excuse
me,
if
the
doctrine
is
valid
then
it
should
be
universal
application.
and
as
pointed
out
if
it
were
of
universal
application,
that
is
if
it
were
good
law,
it
would
deny
deduction
to
everyone
in
a
literal
sense.
so
then
the
commissioner
must
do
this.
he
must
find
methods
for
not
applying
the
doctrine
and
i
submit
that
here
is
no
more
graphic
proof
of
then
validity
than
this.
if
this
were
a
case
--
is
based
on
--
on
the
presumption
that
we
do
not
qualify
for
an
exception
in
this
very
doctrine.
(inaudible)
how
can
there
be
an
exception
to
the
statue
to
primary
to
wring
from
deduction
only?
logically,
i
don't
think
there
can
be,
but
the
commissioner
in
seeking
to
justify
this,
tried
to
justify
on
equitable
ground.
well
i
say
in
regard
to
that
--
that
the
commissioner
is
from
my
outside
observation
has
a
duty
to
enforce
the
internal
revenue
law
and
not
define
equitable
ground
for
not
enforcing
it.
so
if
this
doctrine
is
valid
law,
then
it
looks
to
me
like
that
there's
some
question
as
to
how
thoroughly
the
commissioner
is
--
is
enforcing
the
statute.
the
answer
of
course
is
--
that
basically
the
thing
is
wrong
to
begin
with
and
this
is
the
only
way
they
can
--
they
can
keep
and
tying
it
to
literal
extreme
already
described
and
this
explained
the
development
of
this
so
called
temporary
versus
indefinite
concept.
and
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
if
you
took
the
traveling
salesman
and
said
literally
the
way
was
selling
merchandise
is
where
your
post
of
duty,
you'd
end
up
with
him
--
with
he
being
denied
the
deduction,
but
the
traveling
salesman
fee
is
a
little
more
--
is
a
little
easier
than
the
construction
workers
case
for
this
reason.
the
traveling
salesman
usually
has
a
headquarters
and
a
firm
and
a
place
that
he
works
out
of
and
the
bureau
not
only
recognize
that
that
is
his
post
of
the
duty.
so
the
traveling
salesman
--
there
are
other
types
of
employment
where
i
think
the
question
could
be
more
difficult,
but
as
far
the
traveling
salesman
case,
they
--
don't
believe
they
have
a
serious
problem
with
this
issue
at
least
most
of
them.
did
that
answer
your
question
your
honor?
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
now
turning
to
the
word
personal.
the
word
personal
denial
when
tax
to
an
expense
denies
that
extent
as
a
deduction.
now
under
the
commissioner's
theory
it
works
like
this.
he
says
home
is
where
you
work.
therefore,
you're
not
away
from
home.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
like
to
restate,
if
i
may,
just
what
the
party
is
complaining
about
here.
contrary
to
the
impression
which
may
have
been
conveyed,
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
whether
or
not
construction
workers
should
be
allowed
a
deduction
for
travel
expenses
in
connection
with
out-of-town
construction
job.
on
that
broad
question,
both
parties
are
in
full
agreement.
the
whole
controversy
here
relates
solely
to
the
extent
to
which
this
deduction
shall
be
allowed.
now,
as
mr.
dixon
pointed
out
on
thursday,
most
of
these
out-of-town
construction
jobs
are
of
a
short-term
nature,
requiring
an
employment
only
of
a
few
weeks
or
of
a
few
months.
as
to
employment
of
that
nature,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
commissioner,
and
has
been
for
some
time,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
commissioner
who
has
made
every
effort
to
be
reasonable
in
this
area
to
allow
the
deduction.
but
these
taxpayers
are
not
satisfied
with
that.
they
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
this
deduction
for
travel
expenses
including
the
regular
cost
of
meals
and
lodging
on
an
everyday,
day
in
day
out
basis
regardless
of
the
duration
of
the
construction
project
or
their
employment
on
that
project.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that
the
statute
requires
that
determination.
the
--
in
fact,
this
court
even
recognized
in
flowers
case
that
in
connection
with
living
expenses
at
a
particular
point
as
distinguished
from
expenses
incurred
while
actually
traveling,
that
the
stay
at
this
particular
point
must
be
temporary.
for
example,
the
--
the
court
said
in
flowers
case
that
travel
expenses
in
pursuit
of
business
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute
could
arise
only
when
the
railroads
business
forced
the
taxpayer
to
travel
and
to
live
temporarily
at
some
place
other
than
mobile.
the
difference,
your
honor,
if
i
--
if
i
may
say,
there's
a
difference
between
travel
expenses
which
are
allowed
under
section
23
and
living
expenses
which
are
forbidden
under
section
24.
this
presents
a
difficult
determination.
now,
these
taxpayers
take
the
position
that
the
amount
of
time
spent
on
job
is
immaterial
whether
it's
20
and
a
half
months,
two
years,
three
years
or
more.
panama
canal,
for
example,
took
10
years
to
build.
yet
these
taxpayers
are
contending
because
construction
work
is
in
the
nature
of
a
temporary
employment
because
sometime
the
construction
job
will
be
finished,
that
therefore,
they
are
entitled
to
deduct
all
of
their
living
expenses
during
that
period.
and
the
--
the
commissioner,
on
the
other
hand,
believes
that
the
--
this
deduction
for
traveling
expenses
under
standards,
generally
applicable
to
all
taxpayers
cannot
be
expanded
to
that
point.
commissioner
is
faced
with
the
problem
of
reconciling
these
two
statutes.
congress
clearly
had
two
purposes
in
mind,
and
if
i
may
say
so,
the
problem
of
finding
the
dividing
line
is
not
an
easy
one.
the
problem
arises
in
large
measure
because
the
typical
taxpayer
really
lives
sort
of
a
double
life.
in
one
sense,
he's
a
seeker
after
profit,
an
income
producing
mechanism,
has
certain
expenses
incident
to
that,
yet,
in
another
sense,
he
is
a
human
being
with
a
customary
human
needs.
for
example,
we
all
have
to
have
meals
whether
we're
working
or
not,
whether
we're
located
at
the
particular
time
near
our
residence
or
not.
now,
this
--
this
kind
of
double
life,
this
schizophrenia,
is
recognized
in
the
tax
court.
here,
we
have
section
25
which
allows
to
each
taxpayer
a
$600
personal
exemption
for
himself
and
generally
speaking,
for
each
member
of
his
family.
then
we
come
to
deductions
and
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
section
24
flatly
forbids
any
deduction
for
personal,
living
or
family
expenses,
except
for
extraordinary
medical
expenses.
on
the
other
hand,
section
23
(a)
(1)
(a)
allows
a
deduction
for
ordinary
and
necessary
traveling
expenses
including
the
cost
of
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business.
now,
the
problem
is
to
reconcile
these
two
congressional
mandates
which
are
not
altogether
consistent
without
doing
violence
to
either
one.
the
test
is
in
no
sense
an
easy
one
particularly
because
of
the
commissioner's
obligation
to
apply
the
statute,
so
that
a
deduction
is
not
allowed
to
one
class
of
employees,
which
results
in
an
unjust
discrimination
against
other
classes
of
employees
who
may
be
very
similarly
situated.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
essentially
--
let
me
give
you
an
example,
your
honor.
let's
suppose
that
you
--
we
have
a
traveling
salesman.
there's
no
question
that
while
he
is
away
from
his
home
office,
he
is
entitled
to
deduct
his
travel
expenses
including
meals
and
lodging.
but
suppose
he
stays
at
a
particular
point,
let's
say
at
a
branch
office
for
six
months,
for
a
year,
for
a
year
and
a
half,
when
does
he
stop
traveling?
and
when
does
he
start
living
there
in
the
sense
that
the
section
24
prohibition
against
the
deduction
of
living
expenses
comes
into
play?
these
problems
don't
arise
while
a
man
is
on
the
go
or
is
moving.
the
question
is
what
kind
of
depth
or
exception
can
you
make
to
this
section
24
prohibition
against
the
deduction
of
living
expenses
in
connection
with
this
deduction
which
is
allowed
for
traveling
expenses?
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
there
are
problems
--
and
the
commissioner's
problem
is
to
apply
that
mandate
to
any
--
to
a
multiplicity
of
different
factual
situations
in
the
light
of
the
section
24
prohibition
against
the
deduction
of
personal
expenses.
the
problem
arises,
again
and
again,
where
is
the
dividing
line
between
living
expenses
which
are
nondeductible
and
traveling
expenses
which
are
deductible.
if
i
say
if
--
if
these
people
were
traveling,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
that
they
would
get
a
deduction.
the
question
or
the
problem
arises,
if
you'll
excuse
me
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
when
--
when
the
taxpayer
stops
at
a
particular
point,
for
example,
for
20
and
a
half
months
or
two
years
or
three
years,
is
he
then
entitled
to
deduct
every
--
all
the
cost
of
his
meals
and
lodging
simply
because
he
has
taken
a
trip
three
years
before?
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that
there's
nothing
objectionable
at
all
to
that
approach
as
long
as
he
realizes
that
section
24
has
to
be
applied.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
and
then
we
get
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
then
we
--
then
we
get
to
the
problem
of
defining
what
is
meant
by
“while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
trade
or
business”.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
yes.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes
and
the
commissioner,
ever
since
1921,
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
has
uniformly
ruled
that
home
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
means
--
refers
to
business
home.
the
tax
court
has
uniformly
ruled
ever
and
probably
dozens
of
decisions.
every
court
of
appeals
has
so
held
since
court's
flowers
decision.
again
and
again,
congress
has
reenacted
the
statute
without
any
basic
change
in
the
terminology.
in
these
circumstances,
we
think
that
the
administrative
interpretation
must
certainly
be
deemed
to
have
received
--
implied
congressional
approval
as
this
court
said
of
a
related
interpretation
in
the
flowers
case.
moreover,
in
1952,
this
interpretation
was
given
what
we
regard
as
further
recognition
by
congress.
in
1952,
which
was
one
year
before
the
tax
year
involved
here,
congress
enacted
an
amendment
to
this
statute.
this
amendment
dealt
with
the
taxes
of
congressmen
themselves,
members
and
representatives.
congress
provided
a
specific
exception
to
the
general
rule
as
to
members
of
congress.
this
amendment
provided
that
the
place
of
residence
of
a
member
of
congress
in
a
district,
which
he
represents,
shall
be
deemed
to
be
his
home
for
purposes
of
this
travel
expense
deduction,
but
only
to
the
extent
of
$3000
a
year
and
in
addition,
this
amendment
was
made
operative
only
for
two
tax
years.
this
amendment
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it's
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
dealt
with
in
our
reply
memorandum
from
pages
3
to
6
of
our
reply
memorandum,
and
there's
a
lengthy
footnote
at
--
on
pages
4
and
5
which
still
refer
to
legislative
history
of
this
amendment
and
the
legislative
history
shows
very
clearly
that
congress
understood
the
general
rule
to
be
that
a
taxpayer's
principle
place
of
employment
was
his
home
within
the
meeting
of
the
statute.
mr.
mccormick,
on
behalf
of
proponents
of
the
bill,
quoted
a
great
length
from
the
commissioner's
ruling
and
those
who
opposed
this
measure
and
there
was
heavy
opposition
of
the
measure,
particularly
in
the
senate
because
it
was
regarded
by
those
who
opposed
it
as
a
discriminatory
tax
advantage
in
favor
of
members
of
congress.
it
was
their
regard
--
regarded
as
clearly,
making
a
special
exception
of
the
definition
of
home
for
members
of
congress.
of
course,
congress
did
so
because
of
the
special
circumstances
facing
congressmen
frequently
after
maintaining
a
double
residence.
but
nevertheless,
this
statute,
we
think,
shows
on
its
face,
and
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history,
that
it
was
a
congressional
understanding
beyond
any
doubt
that
home,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
referred
to
principal
place
of
employment.
may
i
say
in
this
connection
that
the
taxpayers
have
filed
a
reply
brief
in
response
to
our
memorandum
setting
forth
this
legislative
history
and
the
petitioners
in
this
brief
have
set
forth
certain
quotations
from
the
legislative
debates.
according
to
the
petitioners,
these
quotations
show
just
the
contrary
of
what
the
government
has
stated.
however,
we
are
real
bound
to
point
out
that
the
statements
quoted
in
petitioners'
reply
brief
are
taken
out
of
context
and
tend
to
distort
what
actually
transpired.
for
example,
the
taxpayers
quote
senator
walsh
during
the
1921
legislative
debates
as
saying
that
under
this
travel
expense
provision
that
congressman
would
be
allowed
to
deduct
their
expenses
while
in
washington.
on
that
basis,
the
taxpayers
say
that
therefore,
the
1952
amendment
merely
restored
what
was
the
original
purpose
of
congress.
however,
the
taxpayers
have
not
read
quite
far
enough
because
on
the
very
same
page
of
the
congressional
record,
senator
walsh
was
answered
by
senator
watson
of
indiana,
who
was
apparently
one
of
the
floor
managers
of
the
bill,
and
senator
watson
stated
that
he
had
just
discussed
the
matter
with
three
representatives
of
the
treasury
department
on
the
floor
and
they
had
stated
to
him
flatly
that
the
home
of
a
congressman
under
the
statute
would
be
regarded
as
washington
and
that
therefore,
senator
walsh
is
strictly
in
error
in
stating
that
congressmen,
under
the
original
provision,
would
be
allowed
to
deduct
their
expenses.
we
think
that
if
--
if
this
legislative
history
is
read
in
context,
i
believe
--
we
believe
that
only
one
conclusion
can
come
from
there
and
that
is
congress
has
accepted
this
congress
--
this
consistent
interpretation
by
the
commissioner
and
by
the
tax
court,
and
as
i
say,
by
every
court
of
appeals,
which
has
passed
on
in
question
ever
since
this
court's
flowers
decision.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
i
--
i
think
there's
no
question
that
he
can
deduct
transportation
expenses.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no
--
yes,
he
can.
yes,
he
can,
transportation
expenses.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there
is
a
--
that
would
--
that
would
not
be
under
this
particular
provision.
there
--
the
tax
law
draws
a
distinction
between
ordinary
and
necessary
transportation
expenses
and
travelling
expenses
away
from
home.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
this
would
be
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
there's
a
--
a
recent
case
in
the
first
circuit
which
dealt
with
this
very
kind
of
problem,
the
amoroso
case
which
we
cite
in
our
main
brief.
there,
the
salesman
worked
part
of
this
time
in
the
boston
area
and
then
part
of
the
time,
he
went
beyond
boston
up
to
new
england
and
the
court
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
his
transportation
expenses
altering
at
time
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
that
he
was
also
entitled
to
his
meals
and
lodging
while
he
was
away
from
the
metropolitan
boston
area.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
all
because
that
would
--
that
would
not
be
travelling
expenses
away
from
home.
that
would
come
under
the
--
the
broader
allowance
of
a
deduction
for
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
mr.
justice
black,
you're
suggesting
the
situation
where
a
taxpayer
has
a
primary
post
of
duty
and
then
he
may
be
sent
by
an
employer
for
a
week
here
or
a
week
there?
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
if
i
--
if
i
may,
i
like
to
explain
why
the
commissioner
is
taking
position
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
worker
is
allowed
a
deduction
in
this
very
case
for
example
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
tax
court
applied
this
special
rule
or
exception
however
it
--
it
should
be
classified
that
where
a
man
who
has
a
series
of
employers
and
has
a
job
at
a
particular
post
of
duty
and
that
is
his
only
post
of
duty
that
that
post
of
duty,
if
it
is
really
obviously
temporary,
that
is
it
is
foreseen
to
be
for
short
duration
and
it
is
short
in
fact
and
at
those
circumstances,
the
post
of
duty
will
--
will
not
be
regarded
as
the
home
and
the
taxpayer
will
be
treated
as
if
he
were
away
from
home.
the
whole
effort
is
to
ameliorate
the
impact
of
that
--
the
general
requirements
of
this
statute
would
have
on
construction
workers.
but
as
i
say,
these
construction
workers
are
not
content
with
that
and
they
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
in
which
they're
--
in
which
they
are
engaged
in
a
construction
job
that
they
are
entitled
to
deduct
all
of
their
living
expenses.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
they
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that
on
the
general
principle
applied
that
is
that
makes
a
taxpayer
should
--
such
--
a
taxpayer
involved
here
should
be
allowed
to
deduct
his
living
expenses
while
he
is
on
a
short
term
job.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
only
the
taxpayers
dispute
that.
in
fact
they're
saying
there's
no
basis
in
the
statute
where
the
--
a
tax
court
or
--
and
for
the
commissioner
to
allow
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
then
--
then
we
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
we
think
they
do.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
in
substance,
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
if
the
dobson
rule
was
still
in
effect,
the
fact
that
the
tax
court's
decision
must
be
regarded
as
virtually
binding
on
this
kind
of
question
perhaps
the
--
probably
the
government
would
not
have
taken
an
appeal
in
this
case.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
but
in
this
case,
the
government
was
of
the
view,
and
i
must
point
out
that
the
commissioner's
determination
in
these
circumstances
is
presumed
to
be
correct
that
the
commissioner
and
the
department
of
justice
were
of
the
view
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
the
determination
of
the
tax
court
under
established
criteria.
let
me
point
out
for
example,
mr.
peurifoy
here
who
is
--
who
is
a
bachelor,
he
has
no
family
but
has
a
beach
cottage
in
--
near
wellington,
north
carolina
was
at
this
particular
point
for
20
and
a
half
months.
there
has
never
been
any
decision
under
this
statute
which
has
ever
expanded
this
conception
of
temporary
employment
to
include
that
term.
in
addition,
the
record
does
not
even
show
how
long
this
construction
job
took.
this
record
is
completely
consistent
with
a
hypothesis
that
this
construction
job
took
five
years
and
that
these
taxpayers
could
have
stayed
there
for
five
years.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
they
didn't.
in
fact
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
he
may
have
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
he
took
another
construction
job
which
perhaps
--
but
he
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no,
it
wasn't
--
i
don't
think
it
was
more
than
100
or
200
miles
away.
he
worked
pretty
much
within
this
approximate
area.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
we
think
that
when
--
when
the
travelling
expense
deduction
has
expanded
to
cover
that
kind
of
term
of
employment
particularly
where
--
where
the
taxpayers
failed
to
make
any
kind
of
showing
that
there
was
an
unavailability
of
employment
at
kinston
and
in
fact,
where
the
record
shows
that
two
of
these
taxpayers
simply
left
for
personal
reasons
stipulated.
one
in
fact
walked
off
the
job.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
and
was
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
and
was
on
that
basis
that
the
government
took
an
appeal
under
the
provision
enacted
by
congress
stating
that
decisions
of
the
tax
court
shall
be
reviewed
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
decisions
of
district
courts.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
two
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
they
left
for
personal
reasons
and
so
far
as
--
as
the
record
shows,
they
could
have
stayed
three
or
four
years.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
that's
factual
question.
we
don't
believe
that
there's
any
occasion
by
this
court
to
reexamine
the
determination
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
tax
court's
decision
was
clearly
erroneous.
only
this
last
term,
this
court
reaffirmed
the
rule
that
where
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
a
fair
assessment
of
the
record,
it
would
not
reexamine
the
evidence
in
order
to
overrule
the
tax
--
the
determination
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
in
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
we
--
the
government
lost
the
case
in
the
tax
court
yet
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
application
of
this
temporary
versus
indefinite
rule
the
government
argued
that
this
length
of
time
and
on
the
showing
made
by
the
taxpayers
that
on
--on
these
circumstances,
this
exception
of
the
special
rule
was
not
available
to
these
taxpayers
because
they
hadn't
brought
themselves
within
it.
now,
the
tax
court
disagreed
and
in
this
decision
went,
as
i
say,
further
than
any
other
decisions
under
this
statute.
the
government
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
say
it's
a
rare
case
when
the
government
takes
an
appeal
on
a
strictly
factual
question,
the
government
did
so
here
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
this
decision
by
the
tax
court.
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
agreed
and
petitioners
then
file
their
petition
here.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
precisely,
yes.
precisely.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
in
other
words,
i
--
i
understand
your
question
to
be
whether
or
not
this
court
should
determine
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
made
what
might
be
called
a
fair
assessment
of
the
record.
oh,
i
--
certainly
that
--
that
question
is
open
but
in
this
case,
we
don't
believe
that
there
can
be
too
much
doubt
about
that
particularly
in
view
of
the
revolutionary
nature
of
the
decision
in
view
of
the
twenty
and
a
half
months
period
which
--
which
peurifoy
spent
on
the
job,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
other
two
taxpayers
left
for
personal
reasons
not
the
exogenesis
of
the
business
but
for
personal
reasons,
and
the
taxpayers
did
not
even
bother
to
get
into
the
record
how
long
this
construction
job
is.
as
i
said
before,
this
record
is
completely
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
--
and
the
taxpayers
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
it,
it
is
completely
consistent
with
hypothesis
that
this
construction
job
take
five
years
and
that
they
could
have
worked
there
all
that
time.
well
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
so,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
--
of
the
evidence.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
--
i
think
that
there
would
be
many
cases
if
the
taxpayers'
sweeping
contention
were
accepted
that
they
are
entitled
to
deduct
their
living
expenses
no
matter
how
long
they
stay
on
--
on
a
construction
job.
for
example,
there
--
at
the
oak
ridge
atomic
energy
construction
project,
which
took
4
years
to
build,
i
understand
at
one
point,
there
were
45,000
workers
at
--
on
that
construction
project.
there
was
a
construction
job
at
portsmouth,
ohio,
it
also
took
4
years.
according
to
these
taxpayers,
they
would
be
entitled
to
deduct
all
of
their
cost
of
their
meals
and
lodging
if
that
contention
was
accepted.
i
wonder
if
i
could
illustrate
one
reason
why
we
think
that
this
temporary
employment
exception
has
to
be
kept
within
reasonable
bounds.
this
deducts
--
deduction
cannot
be
viewed
solely
in
terms
to
these
particular
taxpayers.
the
deduction
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
all
taxpayers
so
as
to
avoid
what
would
amount
to
an
undue
discrimination
against
other
taxpayers
with
very
similar
situations.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
--
i
think
so.
i
think
(inaudible).[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
hope
that
mr.
dixon
will
be
allowed
to
deduct
his
travel
expenses
while
(inaudible).
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
let's
take
mr.
peurifoy
who
as
i
have
said,
he
lives
near
wilmington
in
a
beach
cottage
which
he
apparently
built
himself.
he's
a
bachelor,
he
has
no
family
there.
he
went
to
kinston
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
employment
and
did
obtain
employment
there.
let's
assume
that
in
the
same
car,
with
mr.
peurifoy
goes
three
factory
workers.
we'll
call
them
a,
b
and
c.
let's
say
that
factory
worker
a
has
his
home
in
wilmington
and
he
works
at
kinston
during
the
week
and
like
peurifoy
returns
to
wilmington
on
the
weekend.
even
if
this
factory
worker
was
to
be
laid
off
in
a
matter
of
six
months,
he'd
receive
no
deduction
at
all
for
his
transportation
or
for
his
living
expenses.
this
is
essentially
the
factual
situation
involved
in
the
o'toole
case,
a
second
circuit
decision
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
participated.
let's
take
factory
worker
b,
he,
like
peurifoy,
has
no
job
yet
but
like
peurifoy,
he's
going
there
seeking
to
get
a
job
and
let's
assume
that
he's
laid
off
in
this
kinston
factory
in
two
months,
certainly,
a
very
temporary
period
of
time,
but
again
he
is
allowed
no
deduction
for
his
travel
expenses
either
for
transportation
or
for
his
meals
and
lodging.
the
same
thing
is
true
even
as
to
taxpayer
c
who
has
a
job
lined
up
at
kinston.
but
again
when
he
goes
to
take
this
job,
he
is
not
allowed
any
deduction
whatsoever
no
matter
how
long
he
stays
in
kinston.
and
let's
take
the
example
further,
mr.
peurifoy
is
a
welder.
let's
assume
that
he
is
assigned
to
work
next
to
three
other
welders
doing
precisely
the
same
kind
of
work.
let's
assume
they
have
all
their
meals
together.
they
work
side
by
side,
we'll
make
them
welders
x,
y
and
z.
x
lives
in
kinston
near
the
site
of
this
construction
job.
he's
allowed
no
deduction
at
all
for
transportation
expenses,
for
meals
or
lodging.
take
welder
y,
here,
we
have
a
true
transient
construction
worker,
a
man
who
lives
in
a
trailer
and
goes
from
construction
job
to
construction
job
because
he
doesn't
maintain
a
house
somewhere
like
mr.
peurifoy
even
though
he
has
his
entire
family
with
him,
he's
allowed
no
deduction
at
all
for
transportation
or
for
any
of
his
living
expenses.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
not
at
all.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
increasingly,
we're
becoming
a
nation
of
city
hoppers
in
that
sense.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
welder
z
who,
we'll
say,
also
lives
out
of
town
at
the
greenville,
about
50
miles
away,
unlike
mr.
peurifoy,
this
man
drives-in
in
the
morning
and
drives
back
at
night.
he
also
lives
out
of
town
but
he's
not
allowed
any
deductions
at
all
for
his
meals
or
for
his
lodging
on
the
ground
that
he
is
commuting
and
that
is
well
established
not
in
the
statute
itself
but
under
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
commuters
are
not
entitled
to
deduct
any
of
these
expenses.
now,
i'm
not
citing
these
examples
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
arguing
that
construction
workers
should
not
be
allowed
a
deduction
where
they
have
truly
temporary
employment
but
i
am
citing
these
examples
in
an
effort
to
show
that
this
exception
or
this
special
rule
must
be
kept
within
reasonable
bounds
so
as
to
prevent
undue
discrimination
against
other
workers,
other
lawyers
as
well,
and
in
fact,
other
categories
of
construction
workers.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
in
a
situation
where
an
employee
has
a
succession
of
employers
and
goes
from
one
job
to
another,
the
commissioner
does
not
take
the
position
that
it
must
be
in
--
at
the
order
or
at
the
requirement
of
the
employer.
of
course,
the
expenses
must
be
intimately
related
to
the
taxpayers
or
the
employers'
trade
or
business.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
in
this
--
in
this
situation,
the
commissioner
takes
the
position
that
these
expenses
for
the
purposes
of
this
exception
are
pursuant
to
the
trade
or
business
and
does
not
oppose
the
grant
of
the
deduction
on
that
ground
and
in
fact,
the
commissioner
has
acquiesced
in
this
temporary
employment
rule
which
was
developed
by
the
tax
court
even
prior
to
the
flowers
decision.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that
there
may
--
there
may
be
a
dictum
to
that
effect
but
the
--
the
gist
of
the
court's
decision,
we
think,
is
on
record
page
38
where
the
court
stated,
“if
we
assume
the
validity
of
this
exception
to
the
rule
of
the
flowers
case
as
applied
to
one
not
self-employed,
it
is
essential
that
employment
be
temporary
in
contemplation
and
not
indeterminate
fact
as
developed
and
of
course,
then
proceed
to
find
that
on
this
evidence,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
record
supports
it.
we
think
that's
the
--
the
basic
holding.
as
to
mr.
dixon's
suggestion
that
the
element
of
choice
is
the
fundamental
question
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
tax
court's
decision
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
these
taxpayers
went
to
kinston
because
they
are
unable
to
obtain
employment
elsewhere.
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
they
went
there
because
they
thought
this
was
the
best
opportunity
for
them
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances.
and
at
the
same
time,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
assumed
that
commuters
necessarily
have
any
great
choice
in
fixing
their
residence.
there
may
be
innumerable
factors
which
motivate
a
commuter
to
live
in
one
city
and
to
work
in
another.
it
may
be
the
situation
of
the
school,
location
of
a
particular
position,
innumerable
non-business
factors.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
we
--
we
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
we
don't
believe
that
it's
the
commissioner's
business
to
inquire
into
these
private
personal
matters.
and
in
--
in
our
view,
the
--
the
term
“personal”
as
used
within
section
24
simply
refers
to
non-business
expenses
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
reasonableness
of
moving
--
moving
one
family.
for
example,
here,
during
the
war
in
washington,
many,
many
people
including
lawyers
came
to
washington
for
the
duration
for
temporary
employment
and
this
is
all
for
patriotic
reasons.
it
maybe
that
because
of
the
--
the
housing
facilities
or
for
other
reasons,
they
could
not
bring
their
families
with
them
yet
one
court
after
another
has
repeatedly
held
that
in
those
circumstances,
living
expenses
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer
or
the
worker
here
in
washington
would
not
be
allowed
under
this
travel
expense
provision.
there
are
numerous
other
examples
of
taxpayers
who
have
non-permanent
employment
and
who
would
not
qualify
under
ordinary
test
for
any
deduction.
for
example,
a
business
may
send
a
man
to
paris
for
two
years
to
work
at
that
office.
certainly
if
--
if
--
conceivably,
maybe
unreasonable
for
that
taxpayer
to
move
his
family
there,
he
may
maintain
his
residence
in
a
--
in
a
particular
state
back
home
but
nevertheless,
this
man's
expenses
while
in
paris
or
abroad
even
though
he's
there
for
a
short
period
but
his
two
years
is
not
allowed
as
a
deduction
under
this
travel
expense
provision.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
the
commissioner
takes
that
view.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
we
think
that
in
those
--
although
the
flowers
case
suggest
that
it
must
always
be
in
the
pursuit
of
the
employer's
business
that
we
--
we
think
that
the
court
was
their
dealing
with
a
--
a
lawyer
who
has
indefinite
employment
not
for
a
short
period
of
time.
and
in
the
circumstances
such
as
we
has
--
many
construction
workers
have
and
they
go
from
one
job
to
another,
the
commissioner
takes
the
view
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable
under
the
statute
to
say
that
those
expenses
were
not
incurred
in
pursuit
of
trade
or
business
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
because
if
the
employer
has
something
there,
if
they
have
been
employed
before
they
went
to
the
construction
job
presumably,
they
--
they
may
very
well
haven't
been
deducted.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
and
there
are
other
examples.
for
example,
the
educational
expense
regulations
do
not
necessarily
require
that
the
expenditure
be
required
by
the
employer.
so
in
some
of
these
situations,
the
commissioner
has
taken
the
position
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
require
that
the
taxpayer
show
that
the
expenditure
was
at
the
command
or
at
the
requirement
of
the
employer
even
though
flowers
seems
to
say
that,
has
applied
to
that
situation.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that
the
decision
should
be
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
reversed.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
for
the
reason
that
the
statute
requires
these
expenses
should
be
incurred
while
traveling
and
the
court
would
still
have
to
determine
that
when
a
man
is
on
a
construction
job
for,
say
--
at
a
particular
place
for
20
and
a
half
months
or
two
years
or
three
years,
that
he
is
engaged
in
traveling
at
that
time.
in
addition,
there
maybe
--
the
additional
question
of
whether
a
--
there
isn't
a
shifting
of
the
home
after
a
man
stayed
on
a
job
for
particular
period
of
time.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
now,
by
temporary,
we
do
not
mean
nonpermanent.
the
fact
[attempt
to
laughter]
is
not
conceived
of
impermanent
or
impermanent
job.
the
only
question
is
the
substantiality
of
the
duration
of
the
job
and
the
foreseeability
of
the
shortness
of
duration.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
was
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
and
--
it
did
develop
by
the
tax
court
with
the
commissioner's
acquiescence.
in
conclusion,
we
would
only
repeat
that
we
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
on
this
record,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
a
fair
assessment
of
the
record
and
on
that
basis,
we
believe
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
