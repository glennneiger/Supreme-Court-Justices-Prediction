mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
issue
is
just
as
narrow
as
mr.
justice
black
stated,
that's
all
there's
to
the
case
and
this
is
the
way
it
arises.
the
dues
deduction
arrangement
came
in
affect,
the
men
voted
in
a
referendum
they
wanted
dues
deduction.
so
then
the
brotherhood
representatives
got
together
with
the
carrier
and
they
said
how
are
we
going
to
go
about
this.
well
the
man
had
to
be
a
member
before
he
could
have
dues
deduction.
so
he
paid
his
membership
let's
say
this
thing
started
here
in
these
letters
march
30,
so
he
paid
his
membership
for
the
month
of
april
and
he
was
paid
up
then
for
the
month
of
april
out
of
his
own
pocket,
but
in
order
to
make
dues
deduction
effective,
the
company
pointed
out
to
the
--
to
the
brotherhood
and
the
brotherhood
had
to
readily
agree,
well
the
dues
deduction
then
has
to
be
for
the
next
month,
that's
what
they
ignore
and
where
they
get
this
whole
thing
haywire
and
not
looking
at
the
time
element.
and
they
try
to
make
it
look
as
if
we
are
collecting
for
money
after
the
man
had
passed
out
of
the
organization.
from
the
very
start
to
dues
had
to
be
deducted
and
the
arrangement
was
and
it's
right
in
the
agreement
that
was
executed
between
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
under
which
this
man
himself
subscribed
and
it
read
and
admittedly
read
and
knew
all
about
and
agreed
to
that
in
the
first
two
weeks
of
this
first
month,
he
pays
for
the
first
month
and
then
on
the
first
two
weeks
of
the
month
where
he
is
already
paid,
the
dues
are
deducted
for
the
following
month
which
starts
this
thing
going.
so
you've
got
the
man
paid
up
for
two
months
to
start
with
and
then
you
just
continue
along
with
that
and
when
he
finally
gets
out
he
is
still
paid
up
after
he
submits
his
resignation
for
another
month.
and
of
course
that
i
don't
know
any
these
organizations
that
don't
recognize
that
a
man
is
a
member
while
he
is
paid
up,
the
issue
arises
when
he
ceases
to
be
paid
up
as
to
whether
he
is
a
member
and
he
didn't
ask
for
any
refund,
and
so
the
whole
thing
revolves
around
a
very
simple
proposition.
there
has
to
be
time
limits
to
something.
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
get
together
and
they
say,
how
are
we
going
to
handle
this
thing.
i
don't
know
how
the
other
side
had
set
it
up,
because
there
--
you
got
a
railroad
spread
out
over
several
thousand
miles,
it's
a
thousand
miles
from
san
francisco
to
el
paso
and
if
these
dues
are
sent
in
by
a
treasurer
in
el
paso,
it
takes
several
days
to
get
to
the
railroad
and
it
takes
several
days
for
the
railroad
to
make
up
its
payroll,
so
they
worked
it
out
on
this
instance,
this
happened
to
be
in
eugene.
and
in
eugene
which
is
about
200
odd
miles
from
portland,
it
was
worked
out
that
the
secretary
would
submit
the
list
to
the
railroad
on
the
3rd
date,
send
his
list
in
on
the
3rd
of
the
month,
the
railroad
had
to
get
the
list
by
the
5th,
the
railroad
made
the
deduction
by
the
15th
which
gave
everybody
a
timely
method
of
going
about
this
arrangement.
then
by
the
15th
the
dues
were
deducted
for
the
following
month.
the
man
was
always
being
paid
up
for
the
current
month
because
he
is
paid
up
to
start
with,
this
is
where
all
that
confusion
arises.
they
got
him
resigned,
the
minute
he
sends
the
resignation
in,
when
he
is
paid
up
for
the
month
of
april
they
have
got
him
resigning
at
the
first
of
april.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
no
this
has
nothing
to
do
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
true.
and
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
the
only
issue
in
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
why
he
had
to
use
our
form.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
all
there's
to
this
case.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
alright.
the
agreement
says
and
he
signed
that
he
would
be
bound
by
this
agreement
when
he
authorized
the
deduction
from
the
very
beginning.
he
signed
and
he
said
that
he
assigned
his
wages
to
pay
union
dues
as
reported
to
the
sp
by
the
treasurer,
(inaudible)
monthly
statements
as
provided
under
the
deduction
agreement
so
he
knows
all
about
the
deduction
agreement.
it's
undisputed
that
he
has
been
given
a
copy
of
the
deduction
agreement.
the
secretary
testifies
that
this
is
a
summary
judgment
procedure.
every
member
is
furnished
a
copy
of
the
above
agreement
and
is
explained
to
him
when
he
signs
the
authorization
for
dues
deduction.
so
he
knows
exactly
what
this
agreement
says.
now
this
agreement
says
and
the
brotherhood
is
bound
by
it,
so
is
the
railroad
and
so
is
this
man,
he
signed
authorizing
this
himself,
there
is
nothing
that's
put
over
on
him
at
all.
both
the
authorization
forms
and
the
revocation
of
authorization
forms
shall
be
reproduced
and
furnished
as
necessary
by
the
organization
without
cost
to
the
company.
the
organization
shall
assume
full
responsibility
for
the
procurement
and
execution
of
the
forms
by
employees
and
for
the
delivery
of
such
forms
to
the
company.
now
what
you
have
here
is
a
practical
matter,
you
have
a
rating
seven--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
you
have
two
arguments
â€“
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
now
you
have,
now
this
is
my
argument
now.
you
have
two
ready
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
on
that
line.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
he
agreed
to
use
this
form,
the
brotherhood
agrees
to
use
the
form,
the
railroad
agrees
to
use
the
form.
now
who
is
complaining?
it
shows
clearly
from
the
record
that
the
rating
organization,
the
rival
organization,
the
order
of
railroad
conductors
is
complaining.
mr.
felter
is
just
a
puppet
here
as
far
as
this
suit
is
concerned,
and
the
record
shows
the
letters
along
the
correspondence,
the
order
of
railroad
conductors
is
behind
this.
now
why
are
they
complaining,
they
are
complaining
because
they
don't
like
the
idea
that
this
man
who
has
had
to
belong
to
the
brotherhood
for
a
year,
he
has
had
to
stay
in
there
on
his
own
authorization,
doesn't
want
to
conform
to
the
precise
requirement
to
windup
his
membership,
not
membership
his
dues
deduction
with
him.
now
the
dues
deduction
is
distinct
from
membership.
he
doesn't
have
to
resign
if
these
--
revoking
his
dues
deduction
and
the
other
side
repeatedly
confused
dues
deduction
and
changed
the
membership.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
surely.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
as
i
understand
it,
i
don't
know
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
injunction
was
kept
in
effect
right
along
and
the
brotherhood
haven't
collected
any
dues
since
the
time
the
injunction
was
first
issued
and
i
think
we
stipulated
along
through
the
various
proceedings
that
the
injunction
would
remain
in
effect.
there
was
an
injunction
to
start
with
enjoining
the
brotherhood
from
collecting
any
more
dues
from
this
man
and
they
didn't.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
here
is
the
situation
only
had
been
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
that's
right.
i
don't
know
whether
the
orc
are
deducting
his
dues
now
or
not,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
have
their
own
same
agreement
themselves
your
honor
and
the
same
provisions
in
their
agreement
with
the
railroad.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
see.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
here
is
the
benefit.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
here
is
the
benefit,
the
organizer
goes
up
and
he
sees
these
fellows,
he
said
well,
you
better
get
me
(inaudible)
because
you
now
are
a
conductor
and
you
work
part
time
trainman
and
part
time
conductor
and
(inaudible)
are
more
desirable
you
better
come
and
join
up
with
the
(inaudible)
the
dues
are
little
less
for
some
other
argument.
well
as
well
i
now
--
i'll
switch
over
and
the
fellow
says
all
right
sign
this
revocation,
or
they
can
sign
it
for
me,
send
it
in
and
they
signed
it
and
sent
them
in.
so
he
had
been
brought
out
here
with
the
11
of
these
people
who
are
supposed
to
have
brought
this
class
action
have
(inaudible)
it
they
say--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
probably
it
and
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
these
organizers
of
course
they
have
to
do
a
job
and
they
don't
care
a
lot
of
times
how
they
get
a
man
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
not
to
make
him
stay.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
not
to
make
him
stay
with
the
trainmen
but
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
while
they
make
him
comply
with
this
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
except
for
the
fact
that
it
makes
for
an
orderly
procedure
and
you
make
it
spurious
papers
otherwise.
these
organizers
send
some
men
and
it
isn't
the
man
signature
at
all
and
later
the
man
were
infuriated,
just
as
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right,
that's
all
it
was.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right
and
the
dues
deduction
agreement
itself
your
honor,
not
only
provides
for
all
this,
but
he
signs
it
twice,
when
he
first
authorized
dues
deductions
he
says
in
accordance
with
the
dues
deduction
agreement
and
later
in
this
form
of
revocation
which
he
signs,
in
the
form
of
revocation
itself
he
says
that
he
revokes
the
wage
assignment
to
pay
monthly
dues,
now
being
held
pursuant
to
the
deduction
agreement
between
the
organization
and
the
company,
and
it's
understood
and
he
has
read
and
understand
that
deduction
agreement
that
it's
explained
to
him
when
he
first
signed
the
deduction
authorization.
so
he
signed
twice
and
he
does
this
in
accordance
with
the
deduction
agreement,
the
brotherhood
aren't
trying
to
put
anything
over
on
him
they
just
want
him
to
comply
with
what
he
has
agreed
to
and
the
company
has
agreed
to
and
the
brotherhood
has
agreed
to.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
my
answer
is
that
they,
sir
they
confuse
the
termination
of
membership
with
a
proper
execution
of
the
dues
deduction,
because
this
dues
deduction
is
not
necessarily
termination
of
membership
and
i
don't
know
exactly
when
a
membership
would
terminate.
it
would
depend
probably
on
things
that
are
not
in
evidence
here.
there
are
constitutional
provisions
that
these
brotherhoods
have,
the
man's
dues
are
paid
up,
suppose
he
wants
to
resign
april
1st
and
his
dues
are
paid
up
till
april
30th,
now
we
are
not
enlightened
on
that
as
to
what
the
constitutional
provision
or
the
setup
of
the
brotherhood
would
be.
ordinarily
i
think
the
reasonable
interpretation
would
be
that
the
man
would
be
a
member
until
april
30th
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right
and
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
and
you've
to
go
further,
you've
got
to
say
that
no
orderly
process
can
be
setup.
now
these
men
have
important
lives.
suppose
that
he
is
fired
by
his
employer
on
april
1st
and
suppose
he
has
given
his
resignation
affective
the
march
the
30th
and
suppose
he
hasn't
paid
his
dues
to
join
the
orc
and
he
needs
representation
to
save
his
job
and
he
has
got
30
years
seniority,
which
this
fellow
i
think
had.
now
if
he
isn't
the
member,
they
won't
represent
him
and
he
has
got
no
representation,
he
has
got
to
go
before
the
justice
court
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
the
proviso
doesn't
say
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yeah
it
doesn't
say
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right
it
doesn't
say
as
of
what
date,
now
suppose
he
had
insurance,
when
would
his
insurance
terminate
on
that
kind
of
a
setup
and
if
he
was
going
to
replace
that
insurance
he
would
know
himself
as
of
what
day
he
was
going
to
replace
the
insurance.
he
has
paid
up
with
the
trainmen
for
an
additional
month
after
he
has
filed
this
revocation,
and
should
he
have
to
(inaudible)
two
organizations
and
paid
dues
for
two
months
to
have
representation,
that's
against
the
policy
of
the
law.
furthermore
in
(inaudible)
case
this
court
said,
that
you
are
not
interested
in
helping
rating
organization,
you
are
not
interested
in
these
battles
between
these
organizations
and
that's
exactly
what
this
amounts
to,
this
man
is
aggrieved
to
this
very
procedure
and
it's
a
reasonable
procedure,
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
court
said
it
was
a
reasonable
procedure.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
he
agreed
first
when
he
signed
the
wage
assignment
offer.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that
appears
at
transcript
page
78.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
and
at
that
transcript
page
78,
in
this
form
that
we
have
spoken
of
your
honor.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
he
says
in
the
tax
fund
a,
which
is
the
form
that
they
admitted
he
used,
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
i
sign
and
so
on
my
wages
and
so
on,
as
provided
under
the
deduction
agreement
entered
into
by
and
between
the
organization
and
the
company.
and
the
testimony
is
undisputed
by
the
treasurer
of
his
lodge;
that,
that
dues
deduction
agreement
at
that
time
was
given
to
him
a
copy
of
it
and
was
explained
to
him
and
he
understood
it
and
agreed
to
it.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
but
the
next
step
your
honor
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
next
sentence
may
help
us,
it
says
the
organization
shall
assume
full
responsibility
for
the
procurement
and
execution
of
the
forms
by
employees
and
for
the
delivery
of
such
forms
to
the
company.
now
if
they
have
had
responsibility,
why
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
use
their
own
forms
and
be
sure
that
they
are
not
spurious,
that
some
organizer
hasn't
got
the
--
put
his
name
on
there
and
which
the
man
they
repudiate,
and
so
that
they
are
positive
and
clear
that
the
man
signs
it.
there
is
no
record
here
of
any
force
or
any
intimidation
on
this
man,
as
soon
as
this
letter
was
received
by
the
secretary
treasurer,
he
wrote
back
to
him
sending
one
of
these
forms
voluntarily,
says
fill
it
out
and
it'll
go
through.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
only
has
he
agreed
to
section
c,
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
in
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
no
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
argument
about
that,
the
main
thing
they
wanted
to
be
sure
was
that
the
man
authorized
the
dues
deduction
and
that
he
in
person
did
it
in
writing
which
is
of
course
as
done
here.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
this
is
the
first
time
it's
come
up.
these
agreements
are
new.
the
orc
are
the
same
kind
of
agreements,
the
same
clause
and
everything
else,
but
the
only
question
as
i
see
it
is
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right;
the
only
question
is,
is
this
an
ordinary
procedure?
is
it
a
reasonable
procedure?
did
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
have
a
right
so
that
they
can
keep
their
record
straight,
so
they
can
keep
the
insurance
that
the
man
has
and
the
rest
of
straight
to
have
an
ordinarily
procedure?
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
it's
started
of
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
both
sides
went
in
on
summary
judgment.
we
agreed
that
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
facts
and
so
there
we
are.
i
was
kind
of
surprised
when
it
reached
up
here
on
this
point,
but
here
it
is
[attempt
to
laughter].
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
is
such
that
it's
not
of
great
importance
whether
the
man
signs
one
form
or
the
other,
but
as
long
as
he
has
agreed
to
it
twice,
in
both
agreements
he
has
signed,
as
long
as
that's
agreed
with
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
and
made,
why
shouldn't
he
live
up
to
it.
the
forms
are
readily
to
him,
there
is
no
reason
why
he
couldn't
get
one.
it
doesn't
keep
him
out
of
getting
out
of
the
organization
or
anything
else.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
what
is
that?
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
i
don't
think
it's
of
great
importance
in
this
respect,
as
to
whether
he
signs
one
form
or
the
other,
as
long
as
he
has
the
opportunity
and
the
ability
to
sign
a
form
and
get
out.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
i
don't
know
about
that
[attempt
to
laughter],
i
don't
know
--
i
have
known
of
petitioners
that
they
have
providently
granted
[attempt
to
laughter].
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh
well
there
is
a
mistake
now.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
frankness
to
the
court.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yeah.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
he
stated
it
correctly
in
this
respect
your
honor.
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
in
respondent's
brief,
there
is
a
mistake,
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
it
says
had
the
petitioner
notified
the
southern
pacific
company
that
this
changed
the
union,
that
should
be
as
the
petitioner
notified
the
brotherhood
of
the
railroad
trainmen
of
the
change
of
union,
that's
a
mistake
in
our
brief,
i'm
sorry
it
was
made,
but
it
was
made.
i
caught
that
as
i
was
reading
it
the
other
day
and
i
noticed
it
was
that
mistake,
but
we
don't
concede
that
anything
should
be
done,
except
in
accordance
with
the
wage
deduction
agreement
and
if
he
had
notified
the
brotherhood
and
got
this
form
and
filled
it
out,
that's
all
he
had
to
do.
no
compulsion
was
on
him
otherwise.
there
is
no
record
in
this
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
record
at
all
of
any
coercion
being
exerted
on
this
man
and
as
to
this
man
the
thing
was
an
unfortunate
timing,
because
the
list
had
to
go
in
on
the
3rd,
so
as
to
reach
portland
on
the
5th,
so
the
company
could
deduct
on
the
15th.
now
the
man
writes
this
letter,
march
3rd
it's
postmarked
the
1st,
it
gets
to
the
secretary
on
the
2nd,
and
the
secretary
says
well
we
haven't
got
the
proper
form,
i
don't
know
if
this
is
a
rating
or
if
this
is
what
you
really
want
or
not,
and
i'm
sending
you
a
proper
form,
sign
the
proper
form
and
i'll
send
it
in,
unfortunately
that
delayed
the
things
so
that
he
couldn't
get
the
thing
in
the
mail
until
the
following
month,
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
agreement.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
sure.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
he
had
been
given
the
form
and
he
just
signed
it.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
not
under
this
agreement
because
the
agreement
provides
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
i
think
the
statute
contemplates
an
agreement,
because
the
statute
to
start
with
says
in
45
usc
15211,
that
the
dues
deduction
agreement
is
allowed.
now
that
dues
deduction
agreement
is
between
the
carrier
and
the
brotherhood
and
that's
what
they
made.
now
the
whole
question
is
what
are
reasonable
provisions
in
the
dues
deduction
agreement?
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
of
course,
correct.
now
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
only
question
is,
does
the
reasonable
arrangement
of
this
kind
having
in
mind
the
timeliness
and
the
dates
and
that
people
have
to
act
in
accordance
with
a
schedule,
does
that
violate
the
statute?
and
we
don't
think
it
does,
because
we
have
it
into
--
the
only
kind
of
--
i
don't
know
what
sort
of
agreement
they
would
want.
you
couldn't
have
the
resignation
effective
right
now,
because
the
man
has
paid
up
for
a
month.
i
don't
know
when
his
membership
should
cease.
if
he
has
paid
up
for
a
month
and
i
don't
think
it
should
cease
until
the
end
of
his
paid
up
period,
and
so
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
timeliness
in
the
whole
setup,
so
the
brotherhood
and
railroad
get
together
and
they
setup
a
timely
schedule
for
handling
these
things.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right,
if
they
didn't
bargain
it
that
way.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
all
that
the
section
says,
the
law
says,
provided
that
no
such
agreement
shall
be
effective
with
respect
to
any
individual
employer
until
he
shall
have
furnished
the
employer
with
a
written
assignment
to
the
labor
organization
of
such
membership
dues,
initiation
fees
and
assessments,
which
shall
be
revocable
in
writing
after
the
expiration
of
one
year,
but
it
doesn't
say
how
you're
going
to
do
it.
now
the
earlier
sections
that
say
that
you're
going
to
have
a
dues
deduction
agreement,
obviously
contemplate
that
there's
going
to
be
some
procedures
setup
of
by
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood
to
handle
these
things,
and
that
there
has
got
to
be
some
time
setup,
outlined
and
the
way
it
started
out
was
that
the
man
paid
a
month
in
advance
and
paid
for
the
first
month
and
then
the
dues
deduction
would
be
for
the
second
month.
so
in
terminating
it
you
have
to
have
some
reference
to
this
agreement
unless
it's
an
reasonable
agreement.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
was
that
wrong
for
us
to
do
it,
that's
all
and
should
this
court
pass
on
that,
that's
the
whole
thing
in
the
case?
is
this
court
going
to
say
that
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
can't
pass
on
a
little
matter
like
that
and
that
that
they
can
make
such
an
arrangement?
should
the
case
ever
come
here
on
an
issue
like
that?
shouldn't
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
and
the
man
himself
agreeing
to
it,
be
allowed
to
decide
such
things?
is
this
is
the
denial
of
the
man's
rights
and
is
this
depriving
him
of
a
right
of
revocation
on
such
a
silly
trumped
up
(inaudible)
and
i
think
that
the
court
never
realized
the
time
element
in
this
thing,
and
you
would
never
granted
certiorari
on
it.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
that's
right,
but
that
isn't
involved
in
this
case.
i
don't
know,
it
could
be
another
issue.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
see
that's
an
issue
in
this
case.
counsel
served
upon
us
a
supplemental
brief
today,
and
one
of
my
associates
looked
at
the
case,
this
is
served
11:30
today,
supplemental
brief
for
petitioner
and
this
case
is
cited
on
69
fd.
supp.
the
right
of
the
case
itself,
the
court
says
citing
the
felter
case,
this
one
that
we're
arguing
today,
the
case
is
not
in
point
as
the
question
for
a
decision,
and
the
case
at
bar
was
not
involved.
so
i
don't
know
that
we
need
to
pay
any
attention
to
this
supplemental
brief.
i'd
assume
that
with
that
stated
by
the
court
we
hardly
need
to
answer,
but
there
it
is,
i
suppose
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh
i
don't
--
i
think
that
the
one
issue
in
this
case
as
mr.
justice
black
picked
out
quickly,
is
whether
an
authentic
card
requirement
is
reasonable
and
whether
the
brotherhood
and
this
man
and
the
carrier
can
agree
to
an
authentic
card
requirement,
that's
the
whole
thing,
it
all
boils
down
to
that.
now
is
that
denying
this
man
right
to
terminate
when
it's
admitted
that
no
question
was
put
on
him
when
he
was
offered
an
authentic
card
to
sign,
when
the
brotherhood
has
the
responsibility
of
seeing
to
it
that
this
thing
is
properly
administered,
that
the
money
is
sent
and
this
treasury
has
the
responsibility
and
this
man
himself
in
two
different
places
has
agreed
to
this,
and
it's
read
to
him
when
he
understands
it.
it
reduces
the
chances
of
unauthorized
requests.
it
helps
prevent
organizers
from
getting
unauthorized
signatures
and
sending
them
in.
it
can
only
help
a
rating
organization
is
all
it
can
help
if
it's
decided
by
this
court,
that
that
small
issue
was
going
to
decide
this
case.
the
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
went
along
with
this
on
the
idea,
once
they
understood
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
now
that
this
court
understands
the
issue
that,
the
case
should
certainly
be
affirmed.
