justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
understand
that
the
condition
that
was
copied
by
judge
(inaudible)
that
the
form
was
not
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
the
only
condition,
is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hildebrand
may
i
ask
you
please?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say
now
the
(inaudible)
on
page
16
of
your
brief
about
how
the
petitioner
notified
your
union.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
a
change
in
union
then
no
more
dues
would
have
been
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
statute
as
i
understand
it,
section
11(b)
says
that
the
employee
has
the
right
after
the
lapse
of
one
year
to
revoke
in
writing,
on
his
own
account.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then
he
did
in
fact
deliver
a
revocation
in
writing,
even
on
the
form
you
provide
or
print,
to
the
employer
and
wasn't
that
a
good
revocation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
statute
controls,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
if
it
were
reasonable,
but
yet
violated
the
statute,
subdivision
c
and
d,
a
proviso,
it
would
still
has
to
give
way
to
the
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
isn't
that
a
point?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
i
understood
the
question
was,
and
i
maybe
entirely
wrong
about
this,
was
that
petitioner
contends
that
the
parties
had
no
right
to
bargain
away
the
right
of
revocation
which
congress
gave
him
by
the
proviso
of
subsection
11(b).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
provided
that
section
11(b)
by
servicing
a
notice
in
writing,
in
all
respects
like
the
notice
that
you
provide,
upon
the
employer
as
to
it
wasn't
recognized.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
as
i
understand,
maybe
i'm
wrong
again
about
this,
the
railroad
sent
this
petitioner's
notice
over
to
you,
to
the
union.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
union
said
we
won't
recognize
it
because
it's
not
upon
from
our
press.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
it
is
