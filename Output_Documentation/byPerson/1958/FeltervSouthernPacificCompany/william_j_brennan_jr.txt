(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
not
the
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
same
language?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
a
form
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to
is
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
you
looking
at?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
doesn't
have
to
resign
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
don't
follow
is
why
can't
he
use
your
form,
all
the
things
that
you
described
first,
i
have
been
told,
could
have
been
processed
on
the
form
he
actually
used,
could
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
or
not
he
resigned
from
the
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
he
--
whether
or
not
he
resigned
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
give
me
summary
form
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
haven't
heard
you
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
anything
which
says
he
must
uses
that
form.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all
there's
to
it,
i
mean
it's
on
that
line
did
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
obliged
himself
to
use
this
form
and
nothing
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
are
you
saying
he
is
wise,
he
is
adult,
he
is
over
21,
he
signed
this
agreement
and
as
long
as
this
particular
requirement,
there
is
(inaudible)
no
statute
to
your
--
required
to
follow
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
the
motives
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what's
your
answer
to
adversary's
argument
that
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
they
may
not
exact
such
an
agreement
from
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know.
the
way
congress
wrote
this,
congress
wasn't
concerned
with
representation
as
such,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
continued
his
membership
in
the
organization,
nevertheless
after
a
year
from
the
date
of
an
assignment,
he
was
authorized
to
revoke
it,
even
though
he
stayed
in
the
organization,
was
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
where
--
your
adversary
emphasizes
it
was
a
proviso
and
he
asks
you
in
effect,
and
so
do
i,
where
is
there
anything
in
it,
which
suggests
that
he
may
not
revoke
it
precisely
in
the
manner
he
did.
where
is
there
anything
in
the
proviso?
211
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
thing,
isn't
the
proviso
the
only
provision
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
shall
revocable
in
writing
after
the
expiration
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
i
know
that
the
statute
deals
with
assignments
related
only
to
membership
dues,
initiation
fees
and
such.
this
attachment
a

page
78,
it's
insurance
premium.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
my
question,
you
would
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
a
question
of
whether
it's
involved,
you
make
any
argument
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
time
and
authorization
is
broader
than
the
statute?
