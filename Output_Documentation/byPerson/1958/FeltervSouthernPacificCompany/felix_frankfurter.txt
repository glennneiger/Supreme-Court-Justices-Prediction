justice
felix
frankfurter
while
he
was
a
member
of
the
brotherhood,
requirement
of
using
this
form,
if
you
treat
it
as
a
technical
or
finicky
or
(inaudible)
or
capricious
matter
was
thought,
the
scheme
of
the
union
to
which
he
belonged,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
the
member
of
the
union
at
the
time
when
this
mode
of
having
to
check
off
(inaudible)
of
the
arrangement
of
its
members
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
why
isn't
that
an
allowable
arrangement,
why
isn't
that
a
allowable
thing
to
do,
for
the
union
for
no
reason
refilling
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
long
as
he
chose
to
be
a
member
of
that
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
whole
question,
whether
this
violates
the
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
having
said
that
he
can
bind
himself
as
a
member
through
an
internally
different
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
you
say
because
they
say
if
you
revoke
it
that
he
can
of
his
own
free
volition
subject
himself
to
an
internal
arrangement
which
is
different
that
(inaudible)
policy,
that's
exercising
a
freedom
of
choice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
congress
had
to
take
care
of
the
freedom
of
choice
in
railways
brotherhood
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question
which
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
legal
question
in
the
case,
but
it's
helping
to
cut
through
this
thought,
thought
for
me?
what
benefit,
this
is
a
row
between
the
train
and
one
of
these
many
aspects
of
rows
your
brotherhood
and
the
conductors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you,
this
is
the
first
time
you
try
to
get
speak
for
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
benefit
is
it
for
the
conductors
that
felter
should
not
use
the
form
of
the
trainmen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
answer
me
that
question
if
you
can?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said,
he
is
a
just
pawn
in
this
fight.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
i
want
to
know
why
they
used
this
pawn
and
what
to
end?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
mean
--
do
i
understand
from
that
that
maybe
he
didn't
have
the
facility
of
having
the
conductors
organize
and
do
this
for
him
if
he
had
to
do
it
himself
by
the
getting
the
form
he
might
hesitate
and
change
his
mind,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
understand
this
(inaudible)
fight
on
the
brotherhood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
prejudicing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
are
saying,
you
have
a
right
to,
you
have
a
right
--
from
your
point
of
view,
what
you
are
saying
is,
you
have
a
right
to
all
the
formalities
to
which
he
agreed
by
which
he
was
bound
operating
and
especially
to
will
or
his
inducement
convenient
to
the
(inaudible)
to
make
him
stay
with
the
trainmen
instead
of
going
to
conductors
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
(inaudible)
this
is
a
foresight
as
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
will
thin
three
times
before
he
leaves
you
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
as
an
aspect
proposition
you
don't
care
about
one
piece
of
paper
rather
than
another
piece
of
paper,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
go
further
and
ask
the
justice
burns
question
in
order
to
--
i
think
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
answer
you
have
given.
you
have
to
say
that
what
the
statute
says,
that
is
assignment,
his
personal
assignment
shall
be
revocable
in
writing
as
to
the
expiration
of
year
that
means
that
congress
has
said
any
oral
writing
will
do
and
not
a
writing
to
which
he
agreed
as
a
member,
you
have
to
go
that
far.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
no
reason
for
going
that
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
one
of
these
days
we'll
have
a
case
where
they
got
one
of
your
men.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
got
one
of
their
men
and
they
are
objecting.
