what
would
have
happened
sir

notified
the

that
he
changed

justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
situation
now?
are
they
continuing
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
asking
for
money
damages
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
this.
as
i
understand
it,
they
say
that
if
you
had
notified
them
that
you're
no
longer
a
member
of
the
union,
even
though
that
notification
was
not
written
in
one
of
their
forms,
they
would
have
honored
that
and
ceased
to
check
him
off?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
say
that
here,
don't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
what
i'm
saying
now
that
they
say
it
is
something
that
they
raise
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
my
question
directly
is
what
kind
of
a
controversy
we've
got
up
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
