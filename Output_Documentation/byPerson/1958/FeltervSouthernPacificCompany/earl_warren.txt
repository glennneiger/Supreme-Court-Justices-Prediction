chief
justice
earl
warren
number
269,
marion
s.
felter,
on
behalf
of
himself
and
others
similarly
situated,
petitioner,
versus
southern
pacific
company
et
al.
mr.
wilmarth,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
do
here
mr.
wilmarth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
i'd
like
to
ask
is,
how
does
that
vary
from
what
you
say
the
respondents
now
say
at
this
point
they
will
be
willing
to
accept?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wilmarth
i
didn't
hear
an
answer
that
enlightened
me
on
my
question
to
you.
as
i
understood
you,
in
the
courts
below
the
respondent
took
the
position
that
your
client
was
obliged
to
use
the
identical
form
that
they
had
prescribed
and
had
printed.
but
that
in
this
court,
they
had
changed
their
position
and
said
that
if
an
unequivocal
request
had
been
made
or
was
made
to
the
company,
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
now
as
i
understood
you,
he
did
make
an
unequivocal
request
to
the
company,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
then
that's
right,
i
won't
bother
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
that
was
--
if
that
request
was
made
of
the
railroad,
why
isn't
that
an
unequivocal
request?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
want
to
know,
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
appear
in
their
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hildebrand
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
grant,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
you
have
taken
the
certain
position
in
the
courts
below
with
relation
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
finish
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
finish
my
question
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
counselor
to
say
that
you
had
taken
one
position
in
the
courts
below
as
to
the
necessity
for
the
use
of
the
printed
document
issued
by
the
--
by
your
union,
and
then
he
stated
that
in
this
court
you
have
changed
your
position
and
you
have
stated
that
if
such
an
application
is
--
of
revocation
is
made
directly
to
the
company,
that
it
will
be
honored
and
that
there
is
no
quarrel
between
you.
now
he
said
if
that
--
if
the
courts
defined
that
is
the
situation,
that
he
has
no
quarrel
with
it.
did
he
state
the
situation
accurately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
will
be
when
the
red
light
is
on.
