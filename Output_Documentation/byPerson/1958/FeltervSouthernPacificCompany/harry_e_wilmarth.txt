mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
provisions
for
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
rights
of
rail
employees
under
that
and
more
particularly,
the
sections
dealing
with
“checkoff”
agreements.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i'll
refer
to
--
to
some
of
the
salient
provisions
of
the
act
and
the
features
of
it
before
turning
to
the
facts
of
the
case
because
we
believe
the
facts
which
were
undisputed
will
have
more
significance
with
the
act
is
dealt
with
first
and
then
the
facts
taken
out.
the
specific
provisions
of
the
act
involved
in
this
particular
case
are
set
forth
in
an
appendix
to
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
being
the
green
brief
and
in
the
back
of
that
brief
is
divider
--
blue
divider
and
the
provisions
of
the
act
involved
here
are
set
out.
as
a
preliminary
manner,
the
court
will
observe
section
2
fourth
on
the
first
page
of
the
appendix
which
is
followed
by
section
2
eleventh
beginning
on
the
second
page
of
the
appendix.
those
two
sections
were
enacted
at
different
times.
section
2
fourth
came
into
the
railway
labor
act
in
1934,
section
2
eleventh
came
into
the
act
in
1951.
section
2
fourth
refers
and
prohibit
influencing
or
coercing
rights
of
self
organization
by
railroads.
i
refer
to
it
now
specifically
because
near
the
bottom
of
that
section
has
one
of
the
prohibited
acts
“checkoff”
agreements
were
prohibited.
in
other
words,
congress
recognize
the
fact
that
“checkoff”
agreements
as
such
or
where
the
railroad
checks
off
dues
might
be
a
means
of
influencing
employees
and
rights
of
self
organization.
they
specifically
prohibited
“checkoff”
agreements
or
any
form
of
deduction
of
wages
or
dues
at
that
time.
that
continued
in
the
act
until
1951
when
section
2
eleventh
was
adopted
which
permitted
certain
form
of
checkoff.
now,
i
only
advert
to
that
situation
for
this
reason.
since
2
fourth
is
still
in
the
act
with
a
blanket
prohibition
against
“checkoff”
agreements
except
to
the
extent
that
it
is
amended
by
2
eleventh.
2
eleventh
would
be
considered
an
exception
to
the
general
prohibition
provided
by
2
fourth.
and
i
would
assume
that
fact
would
impel
this
court
to
the
consideration
that
2
eleventh
should
be
strictly
construed
as
an
exception
in
the
statute
to
the
general
prohibition.
now,
looking
at
2
eleventh,
and
on
pages
--
the
bottom
of
page
2
and
page
3
of
the
appendix,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
two
or
three
considerations
regarding
that
section.
the
first
is
subsection
(b)
of
2
eleventh
permits
carriers
and
organizations
--
railway
labor
organizations
to
enter
into
“checkoff”
agreements
and
negotiate
those
agreements.
however,
a
--
a
“checkoff”
agreement
negotiated
by
a
collective
bargaining
representative
does
not
become
applicable
to
the
craft
as
such
as
general
collective
bargaining
agreements
do.
the
statute
specifically
limits
a
“checkoff”
agreement
to
the
members
in
the
organization
and
doesn't
apply
generally
to
the
craft
as
such.
for
example,
absent
a
union
shop
contract,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
may
represent
the
craft
of
trainmen
on
the
southern
pacific
railroad.
that
craft
of
trainmen
so
represented
will
be
bound
by
collective
bargaining
contracts
made
in
it
--
their
behalf
by
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
however,
among
the
craft,
there
may
be
a
number
who
do
not
belong
to
either
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
or
any
railroad
organization.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
--
the
point
which
i
was
addressing
myself
--
the
agreement
itself,
in
and
of
itself
didn't
become
applicable
to
the
craft
as
a
whole.
now
that
point
is
made
clear
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
the
appendix,
the
last
few
lines
in
which
it
says
that
“no
agreement
made
pursuant
to
subparagraph
(b)”
which
is
the
check
off
paragraph,
“shall
provide
for
deductions
and
payments
to
the
union
of
dues
other
than
that
in
which
he
holds
membership.”
now
that
particular
section
is
important
because
it's
involved
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
employee
had
terminated
his
membership
in
the
union.
the
union
in
the
carrier
insisted,
however,
that
unless
he
followed
certain
conditions
in
the
collective
agreement,
they
would
continue
to
deduct
dues
and
pay
them
over
to
the
union
even
though
he
had
terminated
his
membership,
which
we
claim
is
invalid
under
the
railway
labor
act.
now
in
addition
on
page
4
as
a
last
proviso
guarantees
to
the
employee
that
he
may
change
membership
from
one
union
to
another,
and
that
nothing
in
the
act
or
in
the
agreement
shall
prevent
him
from
having
that
right
of
change.
at
the
top
of
page
3
of
the
appendix,
we
would
like
to
emphasis
this
fact;
a
head
of
the
proviso,
that
is
section
b
of
11,
which
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
and
the
top
of
page
3,
“a
head
of
the
proviso
deals
with
action
between
the
carrier
and
the
union.”
in
other
words,
the
carrier
and
the
union
are
permitted
and
authorized
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
a
check
off
agreement.
the
proviso,
however,
doesn't
deal
with
any
action
by
the
union.
it
deals
with
action
as
between
the
individual
employee
and
the
carrier
in
a
sense
it's
so
directly
involved
in
this
case,
i
will
read
it.
the
proviso
provides,
“provided
that
no
such
agreement
shall
be
effective
with
respect
to
any
individual
employee
until
he
shall
have
furnished
the
employer
with
a
written
assignment
to
the
labor
organization
of
such
membership
dues,
initiation
fees
and
assessments
which
shall
be
revocable
in
writing
after
the
expiration
of
one
year.”
and
the
point
that
i
am
emphasizing
is
that
the
--
that
the
act
doesn't
authorize
the
union
to
negotiate
in
the
check
off
agreement
anything
regarding
the
authorization
that
the
employee
signs
to
make
a
check
off
agreement
effective
to
him.
that
is
he
signs
the
authorization,
he
files
it
with
his
employer,
he
is
guaranteed
the
right
to
revoke
it
in
writing
after
one
year.
now
in
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth,
in
addition
to
emphasizing
these
points,
some
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
with
particular
reference
to
the
proviso.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
in
our
judgment
mr.
justice
they
would
have
had
to
promptly
discontinue
dues
deductions.
since
you've
asked
the
question,
i
will
say
at
this
point,
in
the
lower
courts
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
up
to
the
time
of
this
court,
the
respondents
took
the
position
that
they
would
not
recognize
his
revocation
unless
he
did
it
according
to
the
agreement
or
conditions
imposed
and
that
they
would
continue
to
deduct
the
dues
even
though
he
had
terminated
his
membership.
now
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
they
have
changed
that
position.
i
was
going
to
advert
to
it
later.
they
now
say
that
if
he
had
sent
a
letter
to
the
carrier
advising
the
carrier
that
he
had
terminated
his
membership,
they
would
have
stopped
dues
deductions
immediately
or
respectively
(inaudible)
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
very
well,
he
submitted
a
revocation
in
writing
in
the
exact
form
provided
by
the
dues
deduction
agreement,
sent
that
form
both
to
the
carrier
and
the
union
saying
i
revoke
my
dues
deduction.
the
carrier
at
first
recognized
that
it's
valid
and
transmitted
to
the
union
to
be
noted.
the
union
however
stated
that
it
did
not
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
dues
deduction
agreement,
that
the
form
that
he
had
submitted
had
not
been
printed
by
the
union
and
that
he
must
come
to
the
union,
obtain
a
form
that
has
been
printed
by
it
and
submit
that
form.
the
union
--
the
agreement
itself
appears
at
page
74
of
the
record,
the
first
paragraph
just
states
that
it's
a
check
off
relating
to
members,
paragraph
b
states
that
the
signed
authorization
maybe
revoked
in
writing
at
any
time
after
the
expiration
of
the
year.
at
the
end
of
the
agreement,
there
are
forms
set
forth
both
for
authorization
and
for
revocation
and
in
this
case
we
have
not
challenged
the
forms
themselves.
it's
not
before
the
court,
probably
the
man
could
write
a
letter
in
unequivocal
terms
and
obtain
the
same
result,
but
he
did
file
the
forms
and
that's
undisputed.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
i
think
i
can
make
it
clear
by
pointing
to
subparagraph
c
of
page
75
of
the
record.
he
submitted
that
in
the
form,
the
text
here,
the
identical
form.
they
said
pointing
to
this
paragraph
c,
that
the
form
hadn't
been
printed
by
them
and
he
must
come
back
to
them
or
take
one
of
their
forms
or
get
a
form
that
they
had
printed
and
that
they
wouldn't
recognize
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
and
on
page
75
they
pointed
to
the
provision
in
the
agreement
that
said
both
the
authorization
forms
and
the
revocation
of
authorization
forms
shall
be
reproduced
and
furnished
as
necessary
by
the
organization
without
cost
to
the
company.
and
they
pointed
that
the
language
reproduced
and
furnished
and
said
this
is
a
form
that
wasn't
reproduced
and
furnished
by
the
organization.
now
that's
obviously
a
ridiculous
requirement.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
no
they
sent
him
one
and
he
was
--
it
would
have
amounted
to
delaying
him
a
month
as
priors
dues
were
concerned.
however,
i
think
it
has
a
little
more
significance
and
it
appears
to
have
on
the
surface
mr.
justice.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
yes
and
i
will
come
to
that.
they
argued
to
the
trial
court
although
there
was
nothing
in
the
record,
it
was
an
argument
of
statutory
construction
rather
than
any
record
support
that
their
reason
for
asking
him
to
take
a
form
printed
by
the
union
and
coming
to
the
union
and
asking
it
for
the
form
was
it
would
help
them
in
book
keeping
procedures.
now
it
sir,
no
one
has
ever
explained
just
what
book
keeping
procedures
would
be
helped
by
them
having
the
form
in
front
of
them
which
he
did
send
them
to
the
carrier
and
him
coming
first
and
getting
a
form
printed
by
them
and
then
submitting
the
same
form.
on
page
11
of
their
brief
to
this
court
they
give
what
we
deem
the
real
significance
of
the
provision.
and
they
are
referring
this
on
the
first
full
paragraph
of
page
11
of
the
respondent's
brief
of
the
brt,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
the
yellow
brief,
referring
to
this
requirement
c
which
we've
just
read
they
say
if
this
requirement
is
held
invalid,
it
will
remove
the
lock
from
the
door
and
leave
the
house
wide
open
for
ransack.
sometimes
as
a
practical
matter
as
well
as
--
sometimes
as
a
practical
matter
an
employee
needs
protection
against
himself,
as
well
as
from
outside
undue
influence.
and
the
procedure
set
up
in
the
agreement
in
question
affords
that
protection
by
requiring
both
the
authorization
and
revocation
deduction
to
be
made
in
writing
on
the
proper
form.
now
it's
obvious
this
man
is
a
conductor,
he
works
in
the
craft
of
conductors,
of
course
he
can
work
in
either
craft.
the
order
of
railway
conductors
represents
the
conductor
craft's
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
represents
the
craft
of
trainmen
or
brakemen.
at
the
time,
however,
he
was
a
conductor.
he
had
terminated
membership
in
this
union.
there
will
be
a
psychological
factor
if
nothing
more
against
a
man
when
he
sends
in
a
revocation
in
writing
if
he
has
to
go
and
ask
the
union
for
the
grace
of
furnishing
of
some
form
which
they
have
printed
and
their
statement
as
to
what
it
really
intents
that
they
will
be
enabled
to
furnish
him
protection
against
himself.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
i
don't
know
what
that
statement
might
encumber
mr.
justice.
it
might
be
more
than
just
talking
him
out
of
it.
i
assume
the
very
statement
as
they
put
it,
protection
against
himself,
might
indicate
more.
in
this
record
there
is
this
fact
of
record
while
mr.
felter
was
furnished
the
forms.
i
suppose
mr.
felter
as
a
railroad
man
who
is
and
will
be
all
his
life
has
an
interest
in
knowing
whether
the
next
one
he
signs
will
have
a
lock
on
the
door
stronger
than
this
lock.
in
this
particular
record,
he
brought
this
action
for
himself
and
others
similarly
situated,
there
were
approximately
two
dozen
which
he
listed
similarly
situated
who
had
sent
him
revocations
as
he
had.
before
the
case
was
over,
some
half
dozen
or
so
of
them,
not
denying
that
they
had
set
in
the
revocations,
however
came
in
and
executed
letters
to
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
that
they
had
never
been
contacted
as
part
of
this
case,
didn't
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
and
wanted
to
keep
their
membership
in
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
now
i
assume
they
received
some
of
the
protection
against
themselves
which
cost
them
because
they
didn't
deny
it
at
point
that
they
had
originally
sent
in
revocations
or
their
dues
deductions.
they
just
said
we
weren't
contacted.
we
don't
want
to
be
a
part
of
this
lawsuit,
and
we
want
to
remain
part
of
the
trainmen.
i
think
the
realities
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
recognized
--
congress
recognized
that
if
carriers
and
unions
could
sit
down
and
negotiate
check
on
agreements,
both
of
the
parties
might
have
reasons
which
would
be
inimical
to
the
individual
man.
in
this
sense
the
union
of
course
seeks
self
perpetuation.
the
carrier
may
seek
to
favor
one
union
over
another,
so
that
if
the
two
of
them
can
sit
down
and
as
they
say
here
in
their
brief,
negotiate
a
lock
on
the
door,
which
--
then
the
man's
freedom
of
choice
guaranteed
doing
the
act
is
to
that
extent
effective.
now
whether
it
is
here
severe
or
whether
it's
slight,
it's
to
some
degree
effective.
we
say
that
the
act,
its
legislative
history
all
are
directed
to
one
thing,
the
man
shall
have
free
exercise
of
choice.
even
as
a
member
of
the
union
he
is
granted
that,
he
can
choose
or
not
to
choose
to
come
under
the
check
off
agreement.
he
is
guaranteed
the
right
to
revoke
it
in
writing
and
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
debates
before
the
committees,
it
was
said
that
if
at
the
end
of
year
he
doesn't
like
it,
he
can
revoke
it
in
writing,
that's
his
discretion.
so
that
when
they
negotiate
we
say
that
the
act
in
the
proviso
relates
only
his
choice
alone
and
that
there
is
no
authorization
and
in
fact
it's
prohibited
to
negotiate
any
form
of
restriction
on
it.
now
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
it
thought
that
you
could
imply
that
you
could
negotiate
reasonable
restrictions
on
his
right
of
revocation.
well,
that
means
this
then
if
they
can
negotiate
reasonable
or
unreasonable
restriction,
then
each
case
will
stand
by
itself
if
there
are
--
you'll
have
to
come
to
court
to
find
out
whether
they're
reasonable
or
unreasonable
lines.
we
say
they
were
prohibited
and
to
that
extent,
this
agreement
which
endeavored
to
negotiate
some
type
of
restrictions
violated
the
act.
now
we
also
of
course
i
remember
of
opinions
under
the
comparable
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
have
struck
down
any
attempt
by
unions
to
--
and
we'll
urge
on
the
specific
terms
that
act
with
reference
to
the
mans'
right
to
comply
with
check
off
or
union
shop
agreements.
in
other
words,
the
terms
of
the
act
had
been
strictly
construed
in
one
they
have
tried
to
enlarge
them
in
any
way
they
have
been
struck
down.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
they
are
continuing
to
take
his
dues.
i
would
like
to
particularly
refer
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
it's
a
fact
insofar
i
know
insofar
the
record
if
it's
not
the
fact
it's
never
been
said
in
any
of
the
briefs
by
either
carrier
or
the
brt.
they
were
pushed
with
no
by
their
record.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
no,
i
am
not
making
myself
clear
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
no,
i
want
to
answer
it,
i
want
to
answer
the
other
part
of
your
question
at
this
point.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
he
made
his
revocation
in
writing
and
he
made
it
on
the
form
that
they
attach
to
their
dues,
they
wouldn't
accept
it.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
was
right
on
the
same
form
and
this
trial
court
so
found
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
same
language
just
as
though
you
have
copied
the
form
–
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
--
but
not
a
form
printed
by
the
union.
in
other
words,
he
took
the
form
copied
it,
sent
it
in.
they
said
oh
no
oh!
no,
you've
got
to
come
over
here
and
get
this
form
which
we've
printed
and
send
it
in.
and
the
obvious
purpose
is
you've
got
to
come
to
us
first
before
you
submit
your
revocation
and
we
will
then
extend
the
protection
against
yourself
that
they
say
in
their
brief.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
we
say
it
was
your
honor,
rights
within
the
term
–
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
i
am
sorry
that
is
our
position
that
the
man
complied
specific
that
the
act,
with
the
act
where
he
made
a
revocation
in
writing.
they
say
we
won't
recognize
it
because
you
didn't
follow
the
conditions
of
our
check
off
agreement.
we
say
you
don't
have
a
right
to
negotiate
conditions
in
your
check
off
agreement,
which
will
impair
his
statutory
right
to
exercise
his
revocation
in
writing
which
he
did.
he
has
the
statutory
right,
you
don't
have
a
right
to
modify
that
statutory
right
it's
self
executed.
he
made
his
revocation
in
writing
he
should
have
it
recognized.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
right.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
the
only
condition.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
you
do
to
it
this
extent
your
honor.
if
you'd
turn
to
page
79
of
the
record,
you
will
find
attached
the
agreement
itself,
the
forms
they
prescribe.
now
the
form
actually
used
was
attachment
b.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
–
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
may
i
preface
my
answer
with
this
statement
mr.
justice?
this
case,
the
pleading,
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
answers
of
the
respondent's
admitted
all
material
allegations
of
fact
in
the
complaint.
the
case
went
to
summary
judgments
on
the
admissions
in
the
answers
and
the
supplementary
affidavit
and
therefore
you
have
an
abbreviated
record.
now
on
page
20
is
a
part
of
an
affidavit,
which
is
made
by
one
of
the
local
officers
with
the
–
just
a
minute
so
make
sure.
i
think
page
20
is
the
affidavit,
it
starts
on
17,
it's
one
of
the
attorneys
for
the
petitioner
here
and
to
it
he
attaches
a
copy
of
a
letter
which
states
that
felter
asked
the
order
of
railway
conductors
to
transmit
to
the
carrier
his
revocation
form
and
this
is
a
copy
of
the
letter
by
which
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
he
enclosed
the
form,
there's
no
dispute
in
this
record
that
the
form
i
showed
you
was
enclosed
although
it
doesn't
appear
at
that
point
in
there.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
that's
correct,
that's
undisputed
in
the
record
and
the
trial
court
so
found
mr.
justice.
the
trial
court
found
that
he
submitted
it
in
the
identical
form
that
the
agreement
provided
and
that
the
sole
reason
for
denying
it
was
that
it
wasn't
printed
by
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
no
we've
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
i
didn't
say
that
to
us
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
for
the
first
time,
here
is
what
they
said
in
the
trial
court
and
through
the
circuit
court.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
–
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
if
you
endorse
what
they
now
say,
we
agree
with
it.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
no,
we
don't
disagree
with
it,
if
you
now
take
what
their
own
admission
is
now,
that
if
all
he
has
to
do
is
write
to
carrier
and
they
will
stop
and
this
court
endorses
their
own
admission,
we
agree.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
yes,
your
honors,
it
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
well
they
still
say
that
they're
not
going
to
let
us
out.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
not
to
my
knowledge,
i'm
not
surprised
this
record
shows
mr.
justice
and
they
have
not
–
when
that
occurred,
i
would
like
to
have
them
explained
because
they
have
never
raised
that
before
in
their
briefs.
first
they
say,
on
the
bottom
of
page
3,
that
–
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
i'm
looking
at
the
brt
yellow
brief.
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
they
make
the
point
that
he
didn't
notify
that
at
southern
pacific
they
were
no
longer
members.
now
parenthetically
i
like
to
say
that
some
of
the
men
didn't
notify
the
southern
pacific
directly
in
this
record
that
they
were
no
longer
members
and
they
were
treated
no
differently
in
the
lower
courts.
now
specifically,
their
admission
appears
on
page
15
and
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
in
the
second
paragraph
under
the
letter
e,
they
say
had
petitioner
notified
the
southern
pacific
company
of
his
change
of
unions,
no
more
dues
deductions
would
have
been
made
regardless
of
a
revocation.
now
if
this
court
approves
that
statement
which
i
think
is,
they
were
forced
to
make
as
a
correct
statement
under
the
railway
labor
act,
we
agree.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
with
the
dispute
that
they're
going
to
collect
dues
from
him
although
he
has
terminated
membership.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
it
may
appear
small
to
you
mr.
justice,
but
to
the
man
it
isn't
small
who
wants
to
revoke
his
revocation
and
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
he
didn't
know
that,
it
didn't
say
that
to
him
in
the
trial
court.
they
said
in
the
trial
court
and
they
admitted
the
allegations
of
paragraph
12
in
the
complaint,
are
on
page
7,
both
of
them
admitted
that
they
told
him
they
wouldn't
honor
his
revocation
even
though
he
was
no
longer
a
member
unless
he
came
to
them
with
their
printed
form
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
right.
now
well
if
he
is
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
but
it
goes
beyond
that,
they
say
that
a
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well,
that's
what
they
say.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
i
don't
know.
some
of
the
initial
allegations
are
in
the
affidavits,
might
raise
some
doubt
but
it
didn't
afterwards.
i
think
probably
ultimately
in
the
trial
court
that
was
a
fact.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
the
point
is
if
he
had
a
right
under
the
railway
labor
act
which
he
exercised,
and
it
was
guaranteed
to
him
to
exercise
his
own
choice
and
submit
it
in
writing
and
they
interfered
with
it,
we
say
he
was
entitled
or
declaratory
judgments
(inaudible)
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
no
he
was
–
even
though
he
had
remained
a
member
and
merely
decided
that
he
wanted
to
discontinue
check
off
and
pay
his
dues
at
the
local
office,
he
has
that
right
to
exercise
it
with
his
own
free
choice
undeterred
by
any
protection.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
because
–
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
the
mere
fact
that
he
chooses
to
be
a
member
doesn't
mean
they
can
violate
the
rights
guaranteed
to
him
by
congress.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
well,
i
agree
with
that.
if
they
didn't
then
we
unite
here
–
if
they
did
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
we
think
they
have.
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
first
our
position
is
that
the
act
specifically
here
is
self
executing
and
that
he
doesn't
waive
it.
he
is
entitled
--
mr.
harry
e.
wilmarth
i
think
the
legislative
history
would
be
that
they
did
just
that
mr.
justice.
