where
and
how
did
this
man
agree
to
this
very
procedure?

where
does
that
appear?

you
have
already
agreed
to
this
procedure
there.

well
now,
what
the
agreement
says
as
so
far
as
pertinent
here,
appears
on
page
75,
it's
on
paragraph
c,
and
it
simply
provides
that
authorization
of
forms,
the
revocation
of
authorization
forms
shall
be
reproduced
and
arranged
as
necessary
by
the
organization
without
cost
to
the
company.
it
does
not
say
certainly
explicitly
and
only
perhaps
does
it
via
implication
that
that's
the
only
kind
of
a
paper
that
the
employee
can
sign
in
order
to
--

check
off.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
and
that
of
course
is
what
this
case
is
about
but
what
i
was
interested
is
where
if
anywhere,
this
man,
mr.
felter,
agreed
to
stop
the
check
off
only
upon
a
form
issued
by
the
company,
because
that's
the
statement
you
made
as
i
understand
it.
