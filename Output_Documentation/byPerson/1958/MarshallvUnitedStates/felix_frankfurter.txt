justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
door
of
the
jury
room
is
open
for
you
to
see
what's
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jury
was
separated
during
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
would
be
going
in
there
just
for
smoking
or
whatnot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
in
there
collecting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
seems
to
find
fortification
from
the
fact
that
he
put
up
no
defense,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
theory
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
out
of
question.
the
claim
that
the
jury
--
wasn't
justified
in
finding
him
guilty
on
the
government's
own
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
the
defense
rest
on
the
claim
of
inadequacy
of
the
government
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
implies
that
the
defendant
agrees
to
the
strength
of
the
government's
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
way
i
read
it
and
yet
it's
a
good
--
judge
lewis
couldn't
have
met
that,
could
he?
i
don't
know
what
else
he
could
have
met
but
that's
what
he
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
--
evidence
of
guilt
maybe
overwhelming
but
not
because
the
defendant
didn't
put
in
any
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
one
because
of
the
argument
that
when
he
doesn't
take
a
stand
and
although
the
trial
judges
admonishes
the
jury,
they
must
not
draw
any
instance
from
that
fact,
it
becomes
--
all
the
part
of
the
jury
not
to
draw
an
instance
in
that
effect.
it
may
get
according
through
--
from
the
denver
post.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
the
jury
might
be
well
--
we
know
why
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
we
read
it
in
this
morning's
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
mean
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
holt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
opinion
of
this
court,
assume
that
they
had
read
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
decision
was
made
on
that
basis,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
--
i've
(inaudible)
for
the
briefs
and
the
records
that
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you'll
give
me
the
answer
before
i
can
get
it.
in
the
holt
case,
one
of
the
articles
which
presumably
or
actually
the
jury
read
during
their
separation
of
this
prejudicial
character
in
principle
or
comparably
prejudicial
as
the
articles
which
you
claim
were
in
this
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
let
me
ask
you
this
about
holt.
was
the
attack
there
by
counsel
for
holt,
did
he
make
an
independent
point
of
prejudice
to
the
mere
facts
of
separation
and
the
susceptibility
of
that
to
disturbing
conduct
by
that
--
would
that
made
an
--
an
attack?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
in
it
of
itself
is
error
particularly
in
a
capital
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
argument
--
if
i
follow
you
is
--
am
i
agreeing
to
the
whole
--
according
to
your
view
that
the
real
problem
and
the
difficulty
in
holt
was
that
the
trial
judge
allowed
the
jury
in
the
capital
state
to
separate
which
mr.
justice
holmes'
facts
and
then
later
the
court's
opinion,
doesn't
try
in
the
ground
for
reversal
and
that
if
jurors
separates,
inevitably,
they
will
leave
the
public
prints.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
fact
they
had
read
extremely
for
the
different
areas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
first
opinion
which
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
middle
of
the
case
but
that's
certainly
one
would
not
get.
i
thought
i
knew
that
--
one
would
not
get
it
from
that
opinion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
haven't
--
you
have
to
clear
another
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
it
will
take
up
a
disconnection
to
another
matter
and
not
accept
thereto,
but
made
one
of
the
grounds
to
demand
a
new
trial
or
some
of
these
alleged
consequences,
because
they
also
involve
the
question,
“how
far
the
jury
may
lawfully
be
trusted
to
do
their
duty
when
the
judges
satisfy
that
they
are
worthy
of
the
trust.”
that's
the
point
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
real
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
opinion
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
saying
that
--
that
i
believe
is
really
was
the
governing
thought
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
holmes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
come
back
to
your
--
your
--
prior
--
what
to
discuss
before
this
namely,
you
make
--
you
make
this
to
mean
that
when
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
allows
the
jury
to
separate,
that
presupposes
the
trust
--
their
good
sense
of
sturdiness
although
exposed,
could
they
be
not
to
be
influenced
by
any
rubbish
they
seize.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
even
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
later
(inaudible)
he
later
assumed
that
they
did
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
saw
the
paper
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
they
avoided
looking
at
the
thing
that
bore
on
the
trials.
they
must
be
wonderful
jurors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
great
strength.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
referred
to
that
(inaudible)
is
that
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
have
that
in
cases
in
the
lower
courts,
in
the
district
courts
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
involving
uncontested
or
accepted
uncontested
claim
or
accepted
claims
that
in
fact
the
jury
had
read
prejudicial
materials
of
the
press
bearing
on
matters
that
were
not
and
could
not
have
been
introduced
as
evidence
that
such
conduct
by
the
jury
had
been
called
to
the
trial
court's
attention
that
he
examined
the
jurors
as
to
the
influence
is
pending
that
such
elicit
articles
had
upon
them
and
that
he
had
concluded
after
subsequent
examination
of
the
jurors
that
they
were
untreated
and
not
infected
by
anything
they
read
of
--
of
matters
that
did
not
as
to
which
there
was
no
evidence
within
the
jury
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
such
cases?
there
must
have
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
are
they?
tell
us.
have
you
collected
them?
are
they
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
can
i
find
the
complete
--
the
most
comprehensive
collection
from
that
note?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page,
do
you
know?
of
course,
that
would
be
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
--
can
you
precipitate
(inaudible)
those
cases
into
a
state
and
what
they
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
case
--
is
there
any
case
in
which
the
ingredient
of
entrapment
was
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
trial
court?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
courts
of
appeals
predominantly
go
on
the
ground
that
they
would
not
overrule
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
who
has
seen
the
jurors
and
examine
and
felt
their
qualities
that
they
would
be
unmoved
by
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
predominant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
great
difference
to
the
judgment
of
a
conscientious
and
competent
trial
judge,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
have
to
say
that.
you
simply
challenge
the
psychological
capacity
of
a
man
to
be
dead
sure
what
does
and
doesn't
interest
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
this
problem
to
you
mr.
francis,
you
couldn't
listen
--
you
couldn't
talk
to
a
more
sympathetic
judge
on
this
matter.
but
let
me
put
to
you
this
difficulty.
if
it
would
be
accepted
as
what
it's
been
called
one
aspect
of
the
american
way
of
life
that
a
newspaper
didn't
print
all
these
stuff
and
if
it
would
be
further
accepted
that
you
can't
reach
the
newspapers
not
to
do
that
and
it
would
be
further
accepted
that
accepting
capital
cases,
it
would
be
on
the
whole
wrong
to
confine
the
jury
during
the
trial
except
in
the
case
of
our
defendant
with
the
notorious
jury
bribing
propensity.
how
can
you
insulate
the
jurors,
the
scattered
jurors
from
somehow
rather
breathing
the
air
of
the
daily
papers
when
they
go
home
to
their
families
and
somebody
stops
them
on
the
street,
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
insulate
the
jurors,
how
can
you
keep
them
so
--
so
intact
from
the
(inaudible)
so
that
you
unsettle
a
trial
because
they
can
keep
immune
from
what
the
source
of
the
evil
you
cannot
reach
as
i'm
told
you
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
you're
going
to
give
several
considerations.
that's
one
or
two
--
yes,
that's
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
also
suggesting
that
a
few
contempt
citations
and
money
fine
might
reduce
if
not
all
together
might
--
if
not
eliminate
all
the
other
headlines
reduce
the
size
of
the
type.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
--
would
it
be
unfair
or
unreasonable
to
suggest
that
judge
(inaudible)
might
have
been
a
more
skeptical
nature
as
the
trial
judge
of
this
case?
he
was
of
skeptical
nature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
this
case
any
basis
for
the
trial
court's
judgment
and
the
answers
the
jurors
gave
him
plus
also
of
course
what
we
know
that
he
saw
their
faces.
but
do
you
think
the
most
penetrating
observation
to
penetrate
in
to
the
effects
of
the
unconscious?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
those
cases
hold?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
they
hold
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
one
of
the
substantial
prejudice?
is
that
the
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
the
ground
in
which
you
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
ground
that
the
improper
evidence
was
not
prejudicial?
that's
the
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
light
of
the
rest
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
when
--
whether
it's
profitable
as
i
get
your
argument,
the
suggestion
is
that
if
the
contents
of
this
newspaper
articles
that's
fallen
from
the
lips
of
a
witness
and
the
judge
then
told
the
jury,
you
must
not
pay
any
attention
to
it,
this
is
improper.
your
argument
suggests
that
even
if
it
were
admit
--
if
it
appeared
in
court,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
call
for
a
mistrial,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
profitable
it
is
that
each
case
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
we
have
to
--
this
court
would
have
to
get
on
each
one
of
those
cases
to
see
whether
it
would
agree
or
disagree
if
the
case
is
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it's
very
profitable
to
this
line
of
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
the
weight
of
the
argument
depends
on
agreement
with
those
courts
which
in
your
instances
refuse
the
mistrial
because
of
the
intrusion
of
this
inadmissible
evidence
in
order
to
have
any
weight.
one
would
have
to
decide
whether
those
cases
are
correctly
decided
they
are
not
having
come
here
for
review,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it's
profitable
for
both
of
the
proceeding
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
argument.
it's
a
valid
argument
so
far
as
it's
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp,
would
you
agree
--
would
you
agree
with
what
i'm
about
to
say.
one
should
reject
a
contention
that
either
--
that
the
introduction
of
inadmissible
evidence
though
duly
advised
by
the
trial
court
to
pay
no
attention
to
it,
or
the
appearance
of
newspaper
articles
or
the
reading
for
having
read
newspaper
articles
by
jurors
does
not
automatically
press
on
that
abstract
statement
a
mere
intrusion
of
inadmissible
evidence
either
directly
to
the
lips
of
a
witness
or
to
the
reading
of
the
jurors
does
not
automatically
call
for
a
new
trial.
that's
the
opposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
admit
also
the
contrary
that
the
mere
--
the
mere
satisfaction
to
the
mind
of
a
trial
judge
that
inadmissible
evidence
has
been
--
has
fallen
from
the
lips
of
witness
or
has
been
read
in
the
newspapers
does
not
automatically
call
for
nonreversal
of
his
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
get
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
agree
with
both
and
it
turned
on
to
particular
--
particular
case,
does
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you're
being
told
--
you're
being
told
the
second
proposition
that
if
the
judge
contentiously
thinks
it
hasn't
or
isn't
likely
to
influence
the
outcome
of
the
trial
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors.
you're
suggesting
--
and
automatically
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
abuse
does
not
carry
with
it
the
moral
connotation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
only
means
that
his
judgment
is
so
against
the
experience
of
mankind
that
it
isn't
an
allowable
exercise
of
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
abusing
the
ordinary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
misconduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
days
does
this
trial
take
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
three
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
--
take
it
in
a
sum
total
of
one
judgment
that
might
make
a
difference
rather
to
the
impact
of
such
charge
was
washed
away
in
the
course
of
time
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
problem
of
judgment
of
a
particular
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
particular
of
months
of
trial
might
be
one
thing
if
throughout
the
trial
might
(inaudible)
three
days
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
that
this
is
the
particular
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
does
this
appear
in
the
newspaper,
page
27
or
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
proximity
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it
contested
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp,
the
defense
of
entrapment
is
a
question
of
whether
he
was
self-starter
or
whether
he
started
and
that
turns
on
the
rate
to
be
given
to
the
kind
of
a
creature
he
was,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
contested
that
through
cross
examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
in
their
opinion
the
entrapment
issue
should
not
have
gone
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
me,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
how
long
it
took
to
get
the
jury
--
how
long
was
the
voir
dire
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
morning.
the
counsel
interrogate
or
the
court,
what
is
your
practice
out
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
said
morning,
what
time
did
the
trial
began?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
does
the
court
come
in
in
denver
--
the
district
court,
what
hour?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
voir
dire
took
what,
two
hours,
an
hour
or
three
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
hour.
