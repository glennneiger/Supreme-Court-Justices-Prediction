chief

mr.
knapp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
difference
would
that
make
as
to
the
effect
that
it
had
on
the
--
on
the
jury
or
the
effect
that
it
would
have
on
the
--
on
the
defendant's
liberty
whether
the
prosecution
gave
it
or
not?
would
not
consider
any
punishment
of
prosecution
here,
but
what
we're
interested
in
is
--
is
what
effect
did
this
have
on
--
on
the
jury
and
what
difference
would
it
make
if
it
was
bootlegged
in
some
way
or
whether
they
told
them
directly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
you
mean
if
the
article
stated
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
yes.
i
--
yes,
i
understand
that.
we'll
adjourn
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
383,
howard
r.
marshall,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
knapp,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
that
isn't
the
thing
that
his
complaining
about
here.
it's
the
real
gravamen
of
those
articles.
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
knapp,
can
you,
in
the
case
of
this
kind
where
a
man
is
accused
of
illegally
dispensing
prescription
drugs,
can
you
imagine
anything
that
would
be
more
harmful
to
him
than
to
have
--
have
it
paraded
before
the
jury,
that
he
was
a
two-time
ex-convict,
and
that
he
had
admitted
that
he
had
practiced
medicine
without
a
license
and
had
dispensed
illegally
prescription
goods.
can
you
imagine
anything
that
would
be
more
likely
to
influence
a
juror
in
determining
whether
a
man
was
guilty
in
that
particular
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
--
one
of
them
was
tantamount
to
it
because
i
understand
that
one
of
the
articles
said
that
he
had
admitted,
that
he
had
practiced
medicine
without
a
license
which
in
itself
is
practically
the
same
crime
with
his
choice
with
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
close
to
it,
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
very,
very
close
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
denying
where
a
prejudicial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
these
are
disciplined
minds
in
--
in
this
particular
field,
they're
disciplined
in
other
fields
to
be
sure
as
--
but
as
jurors,
they're
not
disciplined
in
keeping
such
matters
after
their
--
out
of
their
minds
when
they
get
into
those,
into
that
jury
box
and
i
--
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
anything
that
would
be
more
prejudicial
to
a
man
than
to
have
such
statements,
read
to
him
or
having
read
them
themselves
in
a
case
of
this
kind
or
maybe
if
he
was
charged
of
something
else,
there
would
be
a
matter
of
discretion
there
but
this
is
the
very
kind
of
a
case
that
it
would
be
most
prejudicial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
disagree
with
you
on
that
but
they
try
to
do
it
but
human
nature
is
subject
to
the
frailties
that
we
all
know
about.
and
if
we
are
not
disciplined
to
do
a
thing
of
that
kind,
there
is
assurance
that
we
will
do
it
and
in
this
case,
you
have
--
you
have
practically
the
testimony
of
one
man
on
which
to
convict
this
defendant.
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
these
newspaper
articles
and
i'm
just
wondering
how
it
can
be
said
that
they
wouldn't
affect
the
jury
when
you
yourself
say
that
they
are
highly
prejudicial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
(voice
overlap)
--
suppose
in
some
way,
this
evidence
--
evidence
of
that
kind
or
statement
of
that
kind
had
come
into
the
court
room
itself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
charging
--
we
won't
be
charging
the
prosecution
of
having
blinded
in.
but
it
got
into
the
case
in
some
way
or
other
in
the
court
room
and
suppose
all
the
jurors
heard
it
and
the
judge
said,
well,
i
guess
we
eliminate
that
from
the
case
and
i
instruct
you
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
it,
would
you
--
would
you
feel
it
was
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
stronger
than
the
cases
you
have
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
probably
because
--
that's
probably
because
in
most
instances
the
court
could
grant
a
mistrial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
of
it
and
it
never
would
get
to
a
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
say
this
is
prejudicial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
whether
it
was
prejudicial
or
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
the
fact
that
the
jury
and
the
court
said
there
that
the
jury
took
the
tolerant
amusement
would
probably
differentiate
it
from
this
case
in
which
you
yourself
say
that
this
is
highly
prejudicial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
no
limits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
knapp,
you
may
--
you
may
file
a
memorandum
of
those
cases
if
you
will
for
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
francis
do
you
have
any
that
you
want
to
commit
to
answer,
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
are
illegal,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
do
you
say
he
was
a
self-starter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
a
social
--
social
event,
was
it
not,
then?
and
this
man
approached
the
defendant
then
--
and
told
him
he
is
going
to
make
a
long
trip
and
he
wanted
something
and
the
man
suggested
to
him
a
perfect
illegal
drug
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
said
no
he
didn't
want
that.
he
wanted
something
stronger
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
he
be
entitled
to
argue
normally
that
the
counsel
be
entitled
to
argue
that
on
the
question
of
entrapment,
predisposition
is
an
important
factor
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
--
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
indicating
predisposition.
now,
could
he
--
could
he
argue
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he
knew
that
the
jury
illegally
has
gotten
evidence
to
the
contrary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
--
but
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
my
recollection
is
that
when
a
government
agent
makes
the
approach
to
a
citizen
and
himself
suggest
the
illegal
act
that
the
question
of
predisposition
to
comply
with
such
request
is
an
element
in
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
be
improper
for
the
--
for
the
defendant
to
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
the
case
to
indicate
any
predisposition
on
the
part
of
his
client
to
commit
a
crime
of
this
and
all
you
got
is
the
unsupported
word
of
the
undercover
agent
who
did
such
and
such
a
thing.
isn't
that
legitimate
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
is
it
a
legitimate
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
well,
i
was
asking
you
if
it
wouldn't
be
a
legitimate
argument
and
not
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
--
thank
you
mr.
knapp.
mr.
francis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
--
we'll
read
them.
mr.
francis,
before
you
take
your
seat,
i
would
just
like
to
thank
you
on
behalf
of
the
court
for
having
rendered
this
service
to
your
government
and
as
i
conceive
it
to
your
profession.
we
understand
that
you
are
appointed
to
defend
this
man
in
the
trial
court
and
have
carried
the
case
clear
through
to
this
court.
we're
always
indebted
to
counsel
and
we
always
feel
comforted
when
lawyers
will
come
from
great
distances
even
to
perform
such
a
public
service.
it's
not
a
noble
thing
for
us
to
have.
lawyers
do
that
because
in
every
calendar,
we
usually
have
some
lawyer
who
doesn't.
but
it
is
a
noble
thing
for
us
to
have
both
a
lawyer
and
his
wife
sit
at
the
counsel
table
representing
a
--
a
defendant
as
--
as
you
and
your
wife
have
done
in
this
case.
and
we're
particularly
grateful
to
you
and
you
can
have
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
regardless
about
this
case
as
decided
from
having
performed
the
real
public
service.
and
mr.
knapp,
may
i
thank
you
also
for
your
very
earnest
and
very
capable
representation
of
your
government
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
just
a
list
of
the
cases
just
their
names
just
the
citation,
no
--
no
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
argument
just
the
citation
that's
all.
and
the
same
with
you
mr.
francis,
no
argument
on
them
just
citations
of
any
cases
you
may
want
to
submit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
if
you
wish.
you
may
if
you
wish
but
i
didn't
want
to
put
you
in
that
trouble.
