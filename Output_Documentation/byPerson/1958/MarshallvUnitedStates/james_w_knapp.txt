mr.
james
w.
knapp
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
one
or
two
items
in
the
factual
situation
that
i
would
like
to
bring
out
before
the
court
that
i
don't
believe
my
colleague
has
pointed
out
quite
as
emphatically
as
we
would
desire.
the
first
is
that
these
articles
were
not
a
default
of
the
prosecutor
of
the
government
or
any
of
the
prosecuting
officials.
that
was
the
first
thing
it
was
inquired
into.
the
attorneys
made
their
statement
to
the
court
and
apparently
from
the
record,
the
information
was
obtained
by
the
reporter
probably
from
some
correspondent
in
oklahoma
or
from
an
article
in
the
coronet
magazine.
so
that
issue
is
not
at
all
present
here
and
i
mentioned
that
because
in
some
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
on
this
point,
you
do
find
that
the
prosecuting
officials
or
the
sheriff
or
police
have
been
giving
information
to
the
--
to
the
newspapers
and
we
feel
that
that
is
entirely
different
proposition
from
the
one
at
bar.
the
second
point
is
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
it
appeared
in
the
papers
that
the
information
came
from
the
police
or
from
the
prosecutor,
it
might
make
a
little
difference
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
believe
i
stated
last
night
or
last
afternoon
that
the
statement
by
the
petitioner
was
accurate.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
brought
to
the
court's
attention
the
questions
which
the
court
put
to
the
jurors
on
voir
dire
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
they
could
try
the
case
fairly,
impartially
and
without
influence.
the
court
of
every
one
of
these
jurors
asked
three
basic
questions.
one,
did
the
newspaper
article
raised
any
prejudice
in
the
juror's
mind?
was
there
anything
in
the
article
that
would
influence
the
juror
in
considering
the
case
and
in
rendering
his
verdict?
and
lastly,
he
asked
the
juror
if
he
was
sure
that
he
could
try
the
case,
make
up
his
mind
on
what
should
be
done
from
the
evidence
which
he
heard
from
the
witness
stand,
and
give
no
consideration
whatsoever
to
the
newspaper
articles.
the
answers
to
these
questions
satisfied
the
court.
i
believe
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
there
was
--
we
have
in
our
brief
the
case
of
united
states
versus
montgomery
which
indicates
that
it
isn't
necessarily
the
answers
or
the
responses
which
the
court
gets
but
it
get
--
but
that
--
it
is
--
it's
the
opportunity
to
observe
these
jurors
to
see
them
as
they
answer
the
questions,
to
hear
how
they
answer
them
that
is
important.
and
in
that
case,
judge
(inaudible)
concluded
that
although
all
of
the
answers
had
been
more
or
less
--
had
been
favorable
there,
he
nevertheless
granted
a
mistrial.
it's
a
district
court
case
and
it's
found
in
our
brief.
the
citation
is
42
f.2d
254.
in
this
--
this
newspaper
article
identified
the
defendant
with
another
accused,
swindler.
described
the
defendant
as
a
swindler,
a
jailbird,
a
disbarred
attorney,
an
ex-convict
and
a
fugitive
from
justice
and
gave
other
damaging
details
about
his
career.
and
three
or
four
of
the
jurors
had
read
the
article.
the
--
the
court
said
that,
one,
the
three
of
the
four
who
read
the
article
stated
that
they
could
deal
with
the
case
on
the
evidence
but
the
other
one
seemed
to
answer
uncertainly
and
inconclusively.
and
since
one
juror
had
asked
another
if
he
had
read
the
article,
the
judge
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
the
others
might
also
read
it.
he
got
that
impression
from
--
from
seeing
and
observing
these
people.
and
he
said
the
motion
cannot
therefore
be
answered
by
basing
the
decision
on
the
letter
of
the
juror's
answers
to
my
questions.
i
must
consider
the
impression
which
the
jurors
made
on
me
when
they
answered
these
questions
and
also
the
nature
of
the
malignancy
and
infection
to
which
the
jurors
have
been
exposed
thus
taking
into
account
the
article
itself.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i'm
--
i
--
i
couldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
that
he
answered
--
that
he
--
he
was
faced
with
this
proposition
that
unless
he
was
sure
that
this
man
got
a
fair
trial,
he
was
going
to
mistrial.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
could
not
be
sure
from
how
he
observed
the
jurors.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
here,
your
honor
that
there
were
--
remember
all
of
the
jurors
were
interrogated
separately
and
apart
from
each
other.
now,
several
of
them
said
they
had
seen
the
article.
they
said,
“i
didn't
(inaudible).
i
didn't
read
it
too
good.
i
just
scanned
over
it
but
i
did
see
the
article.”
another
juror
said
the
same
thing,
“i
glanced
at
the
headline
and
scanned
it
as
i
sometimes
do
and
that
was
all
i
saw.”
another
juror
said,
“i
didn't
really
digest
either
one
of
them
very
thoroughly.”
and
mrs.
(inaudible)
said,
“i
scanned
it
over
but
i
couldn't
tell
you
now
what
the
details
were.”
and
some
of
the
jurors
also
answered
indicating
that
they
knew
it
was
their
duty
to
decide
this
case
from
the
evidence
which
they
received
in
court
and
not
from
outside.
and
mrs.
(inaudible)
said,
“the
only
thing
he
told
me
was
that
the
jury
had
been
selected
and
so
many
women
and
so
many
men
said,”
and
he
said,
“i
suppose
this
means
you.
that
is
the
case
you're
on
and
he
didn't
tell
me
anything
further.”
she
discussed
it
with
her
husband.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
accepting
a
confession
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
very
close
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
very
close
to
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
articles
did
not
set
forth
the
--
a
matter
of
time
as
to
when
he
had
committed
these
offenses
and
it
appears
that
these
offenses
were
committed
in
another
state.
there's
no
denying
that
these
articles
were
prejudicial
your
honor,
there
is
no
denying
that.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now,
we
can't
get
away
from
the
fact
that
this
type
of
an
article
would
be
bound
to
affect
the
person.
that
has
to
be
admitted,
it
goes
without
saying
except
that
these
jurors,
say
they
can
set
it
aside.
and
i
think
that
if
a
person
makes
a
conscious
effort
to
do
that
and
if
he
has
given
his
word
on
it
then
we
have
to
take
his
word
for
it.
he's
the
only
one
who
can
tell
us.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
your
honor,
please,
i
beg
to
disagree
with
you
about
that
because
i
think
that
the
jury
has
faith
in
the
jurors.
the
man
who
is
out
there,
they
take
what
he
says.
they
take
the
law
from
him,
they
understand
that.
and
they
understand
when
he
tells
them
that
you
will
put
this
aside,
you
are
not
to
consider
it
in
determining
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
this
man,
and
can
you
do
this?
can
you
do
this
fairly
and
impartially
and
tell
them
that
they
are
to
consider
only
the
evidence
which
they
hear
from
the
lips
of
the
witnesses.
i
think
that
the
average
intelligent,
honest
juror
that
we
have
would
do
just
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
inclined
to
lean
over
backwards
to
try
to
be
fair
to
them.
most
jurors
are
fair
people
and
they
do
take
the
instructions
of
the
court
to
heart.
we
have
cases
where
they
come
back
and
i
ask
for
further
instruction
because
they
need
to
be
enlightened.
and
i
--
i
think
that
every
fair
american
juror
does
his
best
to
abide
by
the
rulings
of
the
court
and
to
put
aside
things
of
this
nature.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
we
can't
get
away
from
that
that
if
considered
by
the
jury,
there
would
be
prejudicial.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
i
admit
that.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
your
honor
please,
the
petitioner
has
made
that
point
quite
strongly
in
his
brief
and
his
reply
brief.
after
i
received
his
reply
brief,
i
went
into
the
library
and
look
up
and
i
found
i
think
court
cases
which
are
not
in
our
brief.
and
i
would
like
permission
to
submit
them
to
the
court
on
this
very
point.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
on
this
--
on
this
point,
the
question
of
it
coming
in
during
the
trial,
i
don't
think
we
have
any
cases
particularly
in
our
brief
or
it's
coming
in
at
the
trial
through
the
lips
of
witnesses.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
it
may
well
be
but
we
have
some
cases
where
they
did
not.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
one
is
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
they
hold
that
the
matter
is
one
for
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
and
that
having
seen
and
observed
the
--
the
impropriety,
the
court
was
best
suited
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
mistrial
should
be
granted
and
that's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
in
other
words
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
right.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
the
court
here
said
that
in
some
of
them
they
say
the
instructions
were
adequate
to
take
care
of
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
in
one
case,
this
reistroffer
case,
your
honor
which
is
found
at
258
f.2d
379.
one
of
the
witnesses
in
testifying
said
about
the
defendant.
he
testified
through
telephone
conversation.
i
says
you're
nothing
but
a
damn
ex-convict.
the
court
promptly
constructed
the
jury
to
disregard
it
and
admonish
the
jury
there
is
no
proof
of
the
claims
made
apparently
in
anger
and
in
argument
over
the
phone.
it
also
stated
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
that
the
court
had
heard
the
whole
thing,
saw
the
jury
and
that
they
regarded
the
witness
with
tolerant
amusement.
the
court
said
that
it
was
one
of
the
inadvertent
statements
which
come
in
occasionally
and
there
will
be
no
mistrial.
the
circuit
court
held
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
court
in
its
treatment
of
what
was
actually
a
mere
rudeness
on
the
part
of
the
witness.
now
we
have
some
other
cases
which
i
would
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
258
f.2d,
page
379.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
it
still
would
be
prejudicial
to
know
the
man
was
an
ex-convict.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
my
point
is
that
you
have
to
see
how
these
jurors
react,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
this
is
exactly
what
he
did
here.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
that
wouldn't
be
exactly
this
case.
i
suppose
that
in
anything
where
we
have
to
determine
whether
a
trial
court
abused
its
discretion,
there
would
be
limits.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
my
argument
is
that
it
wouldn't
necessarily
call
for
a
mistrial
or
that
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
we
have
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
we
have
courts
of
the
appeals
to
do
that,
your
honor
and
normally
(voice
overlap)
wouldn't
come
here.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well.
your
honor
it's
possible
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it's
possible
that
you
misconceive
my
main
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
this
is
a
matter
for
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
the
defense's
argument
is
that
this
is
automatically
a
mistrial.
now,
we
are
contending
that
there
are
certainly
a
great
many
situations
and
you
can
imagine
all
kinds
of
different
methods
by
which
a
person
might
be
prejudice
by
a
newspaper
article.

mr.

i
gave
these
questions

these
cases
to
mr.

night

--
so
that
he
could
be
prepared
to
answer
them
on
rebuttal.
mr.
james

that
is
our
position.
mr.
james
w.

oh
we
don't
--
we
contend
that
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
(voice

--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
of
course
it
does,
your
honor.
and
on
that
we
have
to
defend
upon
the
good
sense
of
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
in
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
oh
he
ought
not
be
reversed,
your
honor
unless
it's
clear
that
he
has
abused
his
discretion.of
course
all
matters
of
discretion
are
subject
to
review
for
abuse.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
it's
legal
abuse.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now,
i
submit
that
this
court
in
remmer
versus
the
united
states
followed
essentially
this
--
this
procedure.
in
that
case,
if
the
court
recalls,
the
cases
came
up
in
1953.
during
the
trial
an
unnamed
person
communicated
with
the
juror
and
remarked
that
he
could
profit
by
bringing
in
a
verdict
favorable
to
the
petitioner.
the
incident
was
reported
to
the
judge
and
discussed
it
with
the
prosecutor.
an
fbi
investigation
was
set
on
for
the
bureau
did
investigate
and
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
concluded
that
the
remark
was
made
in
just
and
nothing
further
was
done.
defense
counsel
learned
of
this
after
the
verdict
and
move
for
a
new
trial
contending
that
they
would
have
requested
a
replacement
of
the
juror
had
they
been
aware
of
this
occurrence.
this
court
held
that
any
private
communication
or
contact
or
tampering
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
juror
during
a
trial
about
the
matter
pending
before
the
jury
is
deemed
presumptively
prejudicial
if
not
made
in
pursuance
of
known
rules
and
instructions
and
directions
of
the
court
with
full
knowledge
of
the
parties.
from
the
record,
the
court
--
this
court
could
not
know
what
transpire
the
sending
of
an
fbi
agent
into
the
midst
of
the
trial
to
investigate
a
juror
was
considered
conduct
which
was
bound
to
impress
the
juror
and
apt
to
do
so
unduly.
the
trial
court
--
this
court
held
that
the
trial
court
should
not
decide
and
take
final
action
ex
parte
on
such
information
but
should
determine
the
circumstances
of
the
impact
thereof
upon
the
juror
and
whether
or
not
it
was
prejudicial
in
a
hearing
with
all
interested
parties
permitted
to
participate.
it
was
remanded.
the
trail
court
held
such
a
hearing
but
restricted
it
to
whether
or
not
what
effect
the
fbi
inquiry
would
have
on
the
jury.
this
court
found
that
the
trial
courts
interpretation
of
the
mandate
was
too
narrow.
however,
they
concluded
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
permit
this
court
to
decide
the
issue.
now,
in
this
case,
the
facts
showed
that
the
juror
felt
that
money
was
involved
otherwise
why
would
have
the
question
have
been
put
to
him
by
his
acquaintance
and
a
friend
of
the
defendant.
the
fbi
had
told
him
they
were
interviewing
relative
to
the
conversation
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
to
it
or
not.
he
had
mentioned
to
two
other
jurors
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
he'd
been
approached
and
said
he
had
been
under
a
terrific
pressure.
now,
in
applying
these
facts,
the
court
remanded
it
for
a
new
trial.
it
said
it
was
quite
evident
from
the
evidence
that
he
was
a
disturbed
and
troubled
man
from
the
date
of
the
contact
until
after
the
trial
and
that
proper
concern
for
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
jury
system
dictated
against
speculating
that
the
fbi
interview
dispersed
the
cloud
created
by
the
communication.
moreover,
the
juror
was
never
certain
or
never
aware
of
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
events
to
which
he
was
a
party.
and
therefore,
they
felt
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
extraneous
influences
to
which
no
juror
should
be
subjected.
now,
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
this
court
has
done
exactly
what
we
are
contending
and
send
it
back
to
the
trial
judge
to
find
the
facts
and
to
get
his
interpretation.
the
trial
judge
miss
--
unfortunately
misinterpreted
the
court's
mandate.
but
there
were
sufficient
facts
from
which
this
court
then
itself
could
apply
the
law
to
the
question
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
i
would
think
there
that
even
in
such
case
it
made
no
difference,
your
honor
because
of
the
instruction
on
entrapment.
in
order
for
this
to
have
operated
on
the
minds
of
the
jury,
there
would
have
been
something
in
the
instruction
concerning
the
predisposition
of
the
party
to
commit
--
of
the
defendant
to
commit
the
offense.
now,
in
that
instruction
--
the
entrapment
instruction,
there
was
no
such
instruction
with
regard
to
the
disposition
of
the
party
to
commit
the
offense
and
in
this
respect,
i
would
respectfully
request
the
court
to
compare
the
instruction
on
the
entrapment
in
this
case
with
the
instruction
which
was
given
in
the
sherman
case
last
year,
number
87
at
the
1957
term
and
with
the
instruction
given
in
the
masciale
case.
in
both
of
those
cases,
they
went
into
the
question
of
whether
an
instructive
or
whether
the
defendant
was
ready
and
willing
without
persuasion,
was
he
weighing
a
promiscuous
opportunity
to
--
to
commit
the
offense.
now,
here,
no
such
instruction
was
given
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
of
prior
offenses
or
prior
disposition
to
commit
the
crime.
and
so
therefore,
the
court
got
the
--
the
jury
got
the
charge
without
any
charge
concerning
predisposition
and
therefore
there
is
nothing
upon
which
this
could
operate
they
didn't
know
about
that
rule.
that's
our
position
with
respect
to
that
of
course
we
argue
--
we
feel
that
the
facts
in
this
case
clearly
showed
that
there
was
no
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
the
issue
should
have
been
taken
away
from
the
jury
and
never
submit
it
to
it.
so
that
therefore
he
isn't
injured
in
anyway
because
he
couldn't
take
advantage
of
an
instruction
to
which
he
was
not
entitled.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
a
clear
record
of
questioning
of
the
jurors.
we
have
the
juror's
own
impressions,
their
own
statements
of
their
own
as
to
their
mind
as
to
their
ability
to
try
this
case
fairly
and
impartial.
we
have
the
judge's
observation
of
those
jurors
which
he
concluded
that
they
would
be
able
to
do
that.
he
said
all
of
them
satisfied
me
that
they
would
not
be
influenced
in
any
way
about
the
item.
it
should
proceed
and
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
from
the
evidence
and
the
law
in
the
case.
i
think
the
concerns
of
the
jurors
was
very
apparent
form
their
answers
and
their
demeanor
while
they
were
here.
and
i
feel
very
confident
in
my
own
mind
that
the
matter
having
been
called
to
their
attention
that
they
will
lean
over
backwards
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
consideration
of
the
case
and
stay
away
from
any
extraneous
matter
they
have
--
may
have
read
or
heard
or
anything
else.
he
further
stated,
of
course,
i
propose
when
the
instructions
come
to
reiterate
that
they
should
not
give
any
consideration
to
anything
they
have
read
or
heard
or
anything
else
and
should
confine
their
consideration
solely
to
the
evidence.
now,
we
have
printed
in
our
brief
on
page
7,
the
charge
of
the
jury
in
its
--
to
the
jury
in
the
court's
final
instructions.
now,
the
court
said,
“now
the
arguments
of
counsel
and
the
remarks
of
court,
the
court
has
made
during
the
course
of
the
trial
are
not
evidence
and
should
not
be
considered
by
you
as
evidence.
the
evidence
that
you
are
to
consider
in
this
case
is
the
testimony
you
have
heard
from
the
witness
stand
and
the
exhibits
which
have
been
admitted
into
evidence
by
the
court
and
your
deliberation
should
consider
no
other
circumstances
whatsoever
and
should
not
go
beyond
the
consideration
of
the
evidence
that
you
have
actually
heard
and
the
exhibits
that
you
will
have
opportunity
to
examine.
so
they
were
cautioned
again
at
the
end
of
case
about
what
they
were
to
consider.
now,
your
honor
please,
this
is
only
one
of
the
numerous
incidents
in
which
we
have
to
apply
the
question
of
whether
there
will
be
prejudice.
it
may
come
in
at
the
point
when
you
are
picking
a
jury
pretrial
publicity.
you
may
have
prejudicial
publicity
at
that
point.
and
yet
jurors
are
not
automatically
withdrawn
for
cost
where
they
have
read
or
heard
pretrial
publicity.
it's
not
an
automatic
rule.
they
question
the
jurors.
they've
argue
the
jurors
to
find
out
whether
they
can
be
unbiased
and
impartial
and
if
voir
dire
here
shows
that
they
can
put
aside
what
they
have
heard,
put
aside
what
they
read,
render
a
verdict
on
the
basis
of
what
they
hear
from
the
lips
of
the
witness,
they
are
acceptable
as
jurors.
we
have
cases
--
we're
doing
the
trial
of
the
case,
evidence
is
improperly
admitted
and
later
stricken
from
the
record
in
all
of
those
cases
proper
admonition
to
the
jury
is
considered
sufficient
particularly
where
the
judge
and
even
there,
you
don't
even
voir
dire
the
jurors
to
find
out
whether
they'd
be
affected
by
the
--
by
what
came
out
in
the
court.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
of
course
the
nature
of
the
material
is
highly
important,
your
honor.
we
could
--
that
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
but
it
is
not
the
only
factor.
that's
not
the
only
factor.
we
have
to
rely
upon
the
average
intelligent
and
honest
person
as
a
juror.
we
think
that
those
people
can
and
do
put
aside
extraneous
influences.
if
we
get
into
the
matter
of
--
of
what
goes
on
and
down
and
the
juries
are
subconscious,
we
could
never
be
sure
that
anyone
ever
got
a
fair
trial.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
this
trial
took
three
days,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
it
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
of
course
that's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
part
of
--
that's
part
of
the
theory
of
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
might
have
some
bearing
on
the
question
as
of
course
in
the
long
trial
things
that
are
said
at
the
beginning
tend
to
wear
away
and
be
forgotten
unless
reminded
by
counsel.
but
we
feel
strongly
that
if
you
make
an
automatic
rule
then
we're
in
the
position
of
having
a
very
difficult
time
to
try
any
case.
this
case
no
one
would
have
imagined
--
the
jury
--
the
court
said
that
he
had
no
idea
that
this
case
would
ever
in
gender
any
publicity.
he
was
amazed
at
it.
what
could
we
do?
the
--
we
can
try
cases
of
notoriety
over
and
over
and
over
again
if
jurors
are
to
be
excluded
merely
because
they
see
something
prejudicial
in
the
newspapers.
newspaper
people
are
not
lawyers.
they
don't
know
what
is
going
to
be
considered
as
prejudicial
and
harmful.
they
are
interested
in
selling
news
and
newspapers.
therefore,
these
things
are
printed
perhaps
even
unintentionally
on
the
part
of
the
newspaper.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
tried
to
ascertain
that
myself.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
believe
that
it
does
at
least.
i
did
not
notice
it
in
the
record.
i
would
hate
to
say
that
it
does
not.
the
--
further,
this
case
was
not
a
case
which
was
contested
on
the
facts.
the
court
below
held
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
defendant's
guilt.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
the
petitioner
pointed
out
yesterday,
it
was
contested
on
the
questions
of
law.
i
believe
he
gave
them
--
i
was
not
able
to
ascertain
from
the
record
but
he
did
say
it
yesterday.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
believe
that
--
that
--
your
honor
that
petitioner's
counsel
stated
the
entrapment
was
not
the
sole
defense
but
the
only
affirmative
defense
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
that
there
was
a
question
of
proof
of
whether
the
government
had
proved
interstate
commerce
the
question
of
whether
the
drug
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
the
question
of
whether
the
judge
was
identifiable.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
but
he
did
not
--
not
in
this
case,
your
honor
because
--
because
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
he
was
a
self-starter
here.
all
the
agent
did
was
to
forward
an
opportunity
to
self
--
for
this
man
to
provide
the
judge.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
but
his
cross
examination
was
not
too
effective.
all
it
showed
was
that
the
man
at
post
is
a
salesman
and
that
he
wore,
i
believe,
some
slacks
and
sport
shirt
and
that
he
told
the
man
he's
going
to
drive
to
dallas
and
later
to
los
angeles.
but
there
was
no
--
he
asked
him
for
some
drugs
that
would
keep
him
awake.
the
--
he
was
told
that
the
petitioner
--
the
petitioner
told
him
to
obtain
no
dose
of
tablets
and
take
this
while
driving
at
texas
and
drink
coffee.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
understand
they
are
--
this
tablet
is
a
tablet
that
you
could
buy
across
the
counter
without
any
prescription.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
that
these
tablets
here
are
tablets
which
are
perhaps
dangerous
to
human
consumption
unless
taken
under
the
direction
of
a
physician
and
that's
the
difference.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
the
government
agent,
keating
said
i
told
mr.
marshall
that
i
believe
they
try
these
similar
tablets
at
least
on
other
occasions
they've
not
produced
the
desired
effect
and
i'd
hope
i
could
get
something
different
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
didn't.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
was
the
end
of
it.
he
didn't
say
anything
else
and
they
talked
about
going
to
dallas
and
perhaps
they
looked
over
in
the
map
then
as
the
agent
walked
out
and
walked
away,
marshall
held
him
back,
he
came
down
and
he
gave
him
the
capsule
and
the
tablets.
in
other
words,
this
man
just
said
to
him
that
he
wanted
something
to
keep
him
awake.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
didn't
even
ask
for
any
particular
tablet.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
that
--
that
he
obtained
the
charge
--
exactly
the
charge
he
was
entitled
if
he
was
entitled
to
a
charge
of
entrapment
and
certainly
there
was
nothing
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
certainly.
there
was
nothing
in
the
case
--
in
the
evidence
of
the
case
to
suggest
that
--
that
there
was
any
evidence
of
prior
predisposition.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
question
came
down
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
there
wouldn't
be
any
reason
for
the
court
to
charge
or
for
him
to
ask
that
charge
on
predisposition
and
certainly
even
if
the
newspaper
articles
haven't
been
read.
i
see
no
profit
in
that.
he
got
the
charge
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
had
been
entrapped
whether
the
government
had
induced
it.
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
government
has
any
excuse
on
the
part
other
than
just
the
only
question
that
the
the
government
induced
it
as
i
get
it
from
this
instruction.
and
therefore,
the
jury
had
no
knowledge
of
predisposition
as
tending
to
excuse
entrapment
or
inducement
if
there
was
such
inducement.
but
we
say
that
here
there
was
no
entrapment
at
all
as
matter
of
law.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor
please,
i've
failed
to
see
how
predisposition
argument
would
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case
because
there
is
nothing
in
there
on
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
whole
question
here
was,
did
the
government
induced
him
to
commit
the
offenses.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
they
induced
him,
the
government
was
out
of
court.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
forcing
the
argument
about
predisposition.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
it
is
if
the
government
raises
the
issue.
it
then
becomes
--
if
the
jury
finds
that
there
was
that
inducement
then
the
further
question
depends
upon
whether
the
government
meets
the
issue
and
brings
in
the
issue
of
predisposition
then
the
evidence
becomes
if
he
did
--
defendant
was
ready
and
willing
--
it
becomes
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
show
predisposition.
the
government
doesn't
show
predisposition,
we
meet
right
on
the
issue
of
inducement
and
that's
where
we
met
here.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
of
course,
your
honor
what
the
defendant
would
argue,
i
could
not
say.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
presume
that
he
could
argue
it
to
the
jury
as
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
stop
him
or
not.
i
think
that
the
government
might
well
object
to
that
argument
but
of
course
by
the
time
he
got
it
in
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
think
its
legitimate
argument
of
there
is
no
evidence
in
on
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
of
course,
you
get
into
the
question
of
character
and
so
forth.
that's
always
admissible
and
at
least
put
it
in
issue.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
don't
quite
see
how
that
is
admissible
on
the
question
of
entrapment
here.
as
the
case
--
at
the
time
it
went
to
the
jury,
i
just
don't
see
and
cannot
understand
how
it
would
be
admissible
--
permissible
argument.
i
don't
say
that
he
might
not
have
made
it
and
that
the
government
may
not
have
objected.
but
i
think
if
they
did,
they
would
have
some
basis
for
objecting
to
that
argument.
there
was
no
evidence
on
it.
so
that
i
feel
that
--
the
government
feels
that
he
has
not
been
prejudiced
on
the
entrapment
certainly
for
two
reasons,
one
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
instructions
upon
which
this
information
could
operate.
secondly,
that
we
feel
there
was
no
entrapment
at
all
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
under
that
posture,
we
feel
that
he
wasn't
hurt
at
all
on
the
