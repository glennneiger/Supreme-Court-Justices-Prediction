justice
potter
stewart
mr.
francis.
justice
potter
stewart
you
stated
as
i
understood
you
that
after
learning
about
the
--
these
newspapers
in
the
jury
room
that
morning
on
the
second
day
of
trial,
you
first
of
all
ask
permission
to
interrogate
some
of
the
jurors
and
did
so,
did
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
appear
on
the
record?
i've
just
been
informed.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
brown
is
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
--
and
then
the
court
proceeds
to
interrogate
some
members
of
the
panel,
does
he
--
of
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that?
i
can't
see
it.
i
can't
find
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
now.
it's
in
the
supplemental
--
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
in
mchenry
case
you're
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
referring?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
would
have
been
a
very
extraordinary
and
unusual
human
being
that
would
have
answered
yes
to
any
of
those
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
francis,
on
that
issue.
it's
true
isn't
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
error
to
submit
the
issue
to
the
jury
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
and
you
would
--
you
have
made
the
contention
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
a
case
of
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
disagree
with
not
only
as
to
that
but
we
think
the
issue
should
not
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
at
all,
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
here,
you
sought
to
raise
both
the
question
to
which
you've
been
addressing
yourself
in
this
argument
as
well
as
the
entrapment
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
court
granted
a
limited
ground
of
certiorari
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
the
one
question
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
in
its
verbiage,
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
fact
that
this
involves
entrapment.
that's
true
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
simply
your
first
to
eight
criminal
case.
