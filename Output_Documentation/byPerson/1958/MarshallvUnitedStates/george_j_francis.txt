mr.
george
j.
francis
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
if
the
court
please.
the
case
before
this
honorable
court
this
afternoon
involves
a
rather
simple
point
which
came
up
in
a
criminal
trial
which
i've
been
appointed
by
the
court
to
defend
the
defendant.
the
salient
point
before
this
honorable
court
is
whether
or
not
the
reading
by
jurors
during
the
course
of
trial,
that
is
to
say
after
the
trial
has
commenced,
whether
the
reading
by
jurors
of
newspaper
articles
which
set
forth
a
defamatory
matter
about
the
criminal
defendant
which
defamatory
matter
includes
statements
as
to
previous
criminal
convictions,
includes
statements
that
the
defendant's
wife
had
been
involved
in
similar
charges,
tried
and
convicted
in
the
same
court
and
sentenced
to
jail,
include
statements
that
the
defendant
had
prescribed
restricted
drugs
for
a
--
at
that
time
well
known
senior
who
shortly
thereafter
died
and
few
other
statements.
the
case
rose
under
a
charge
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
indiscriminate
dispensing
of
drugs
without
prescription,
the
drug
being
commonly
known
as
dexedrine.
the
defendant
never
took
a
stand.
the
defendant
did
not
present
testimony
of
his
own
but
rather
relied
upon
cross-examination
of
the
government's
witnesses
in
an
attempt
to
challenge
the
burden
of
proof
that
was
been
on
the
government.
in
a
very
few
words,
the
testimony
was
predominantly
that
of
the
government
agent
who
testified
that
after
having
been
introduced
socially
to
the
defendant,
he
approached
him
on
two
occasions
--
approached
the
defendant
on
two
occasions,
concealing
his
identity
and
announcing
to
him
that
he
had
a
long
automobile
trip
to
make.
one
from
denver,
colorado
to
dallas,
texas
in
one
evening
and
two,
this
is
on
subsequent
occasion,
a
drive
by
automobile
from
denver
to
california.
the
government
agent
requested
stay-awake
pills
as
he
termed
them
and
after
some
discussion
on
the
initial
approach
to
the
defendant
when
the
defendant
recommended
no
dose
and
coffee
to
keep
him
awake,
the
government
agent
did
received
according
to
the
testimony
the
dextro
amphetamine
sulfate,
commonly
termed
dexedrine.
as
i
have
stated,
the
defendant
did
not
take
a
stand,
he
did
not
present
evidence.
he
did
not
submit
witnesses
of
his
own.
however,
through
cross-examination
of
the
plaintiff's
witnesses
predominantly
the
government
agent
rather
close
cross-examination
and
very
careful
cross-examination,
the
trial
court
grant
an
instruction
to
the
defendant
on
entrapment.
the
issue
of
entrapment
was
submitted
to
the
jury
as
an
issue
of
fact.
the
government
after
they
had
rested
their
case
and
having
realize
that
an
instruction
on
entrapment
was
to
be
given
based
upon
only
the
government's
case
sought
to
reopen
for
permission
to
submit
further
testimony
on
rebuttal.
that
is
to
say
that
they
had
grounds
that
would
justify
the
entrapment.
the
court
considered
the
implication
rather
unusual
because
of
the
fact
that
a
rebuttal
was
being
asked
for
where
the
defendant
had
not
presented
the
case.
however,
the
court
refused
rebuttal
on
the
grounds
that
the
evidence
that
the
government
was
seeking
to
introduce
was
actually
not
relevant
that
is
to
say
the
court
was
saying
you
have
not
shown
me
that
this
defendant
was
engaged
in
similar
dispensing
of
drugs
in
this
relevant
period.
entrapment
instruction
was
given
and
rebuttal
was
not
had.
then
in
a
few
words
is
the
summoned
substance
of
the
case.
the
matters
of
which
the
petitioner
complains
of
here
rose
after
the
first
day
of
trial.
after
the
government
agent
and
a
few
others
had
testified,
the
court
recessed.
the
next
morning,
defendant's
counsel
namely
myself
having
observed
several
newspapers
in
the
jury
room
itself
and
having
been
informed
that
the
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
the
door
of
the
jury
room
--
the
jury
room
in
the
denver
courthouse
is
directly
across
the
corner
from
the
court
room
itself.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
jury
was
separated
during
the
trial.
mr.
george
j.
francis
they
would
be
going
there
for
such
instances.
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
the
court
had
not
yet
convened
that
morning.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
sir,
they
were
collecting
that
morning.
and
defendant's
counsel
requested
that
the
jurors
be
interrogated
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
newspaper
articles
had
been
read.
the
court
granted
the
request
of
defendant's
counsel.
and
on
individual
interrogation
of
the
jurors,
it
was
discovered
that
6
of
the
12
had
read
one
or
the
other
of
the
newspaper
articles
at
pages
52
and
53
of
the
record.
the
newspaper
articles
themselves
are
set
forth.
if
i
may
read
portions
of
those
two
articles,
the
one
article
in
which
four
had
read
stated
first
the
matters
about
what
had
happened
during
the
course
of
trial
in
the
previous
date.
then
at
the
bottom,
the
last
two
paragraphs,
the
newspaper
articles
stated
marshall
has
a
record
of
two
previous
felony
convictions.
in
1953,
while
serving
a
forgery
sentence
in
the
state
penitentiary
at
mcalester,
oklahoma,
marshall
testified
before
a
state
legislative
committee
studying
new
drug
laws
for
oklahoma.
at
that
time,
he
told
the
committee
that
although
he
had
only
a
high
school
education,
he
practiced
medicine
with
a
$25
diploma
he
received
through
the
mails.
he
told
in
detail
of
the
ease
in
which
he
wrote
the
past
prescriptions
for
dangerous
drugs.
the
other
newspaper
article,
the
denver
post
which
is
an
afternoon
and
evening
paper,
stated
in
part,
“the
defendant
was
howard
r.(tobey)
marshall,
once
identified
before
a
committee
of
the
oklahoma
legislature
as
a
man
who
acted
as
a
physician
and
prescribed
restricted
drugs
for
hank
williams
before
the
country
singer's
death
in
december,
1953.
marshall
was
arrested
with
his
wife,
edith
every
marshall,
56,
in
june,
1956.
she
was
convicted
on
the
drug
charges
in
federal
district
court
here
in
november
and
was
sentenced
to
60
days
in
jail.
records
show
that
marshall
once
served
a
term
in
the
oklahoma
penitentiary
for
forgery.
there
is
no
evidence
he
is
a
doctor,
court
attaches
said."
the
request
of
the
defendant's
counsel,
the
jurors
being
brought
in
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
have
read
the
articles
and
it's
being
determined
that
a
number
of
them
have
through
rather
torturous
at
least
on
what
i
considered
in
my
part
rather
delicate
attempt
to
examine
several
of
the
jurors,
not
all.
and
under
interrogation
from
the
government
attorneys
and
from
the
district
court
itself,
the
jurors
all
stated
very
firmly
that
they
had
not
been
prejudiced
by
the
reading
and
that
they
could
continue
with
the
course
of
trial.
the
defendant's
counsel
made
a
motion
from
mistrial
at
the
termination
of
examination
of
the
jurors
and
that
motion
for
mistrial
was
denied,
the
court
stating
that
in
effect,
it
felt
that
the
jurors
through
their
demeanor
and
because
of
their
statements
were
not
prejudiced
and
could
continue
with
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
court,
your
honor
had
sensed
the
entrapment
issue.
the
record
will
show
that
on
my
cross-examination
of
the
government's
witness,
i
began
to
ask
the
person
in
trial.
how
was
he
dressed?
were
you
lying
about
where
you
were
going?
and
the
precise
page
is
not
in
my
mind
but
this
was
the
first
day
of
trial.
the
government
counsel
got
up
to
limit
the
scope
of
my
cross-examination
stating
that
he
is
trying
to
drive
that
and
the
court
did
not
permit
government's
counsel
to
go
beyond
that,
stating,
well,
this
was
within
this
scope
of
cross-examination
and
that
what
would
develop
were
developed.
i
had
not
stated
to
the
court
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
your
honor,
i
do
not
actually
premise
the
position
of
this
defendant
on
the
fact
that
there
was
entrapment.
i
would
be
here
or
rather
the
defendant
would
be
here
and
the
same
argument
would
be
made
today
if
an
entrapment
had
not
been
an
issue
to
the
--
to
the
jury.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
would
have
made
--
i
would
have
filed
the
petition
to
let
it
stay.
the
--
of
course
of
the
entrapment
was
part
of
it
but
the
other
point
was
that
matters
which
could
not
have
been
introduced
under
these
circumstances.
that
is
to
say
the
defendant
never
having
taking
the
stand,
those
matters
could
never
have
been
introduced.
and
there
is
authority
to
defect
that
--
the
introduction
of
previous
criminal
activity
or
previous
convictions
if
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury
during
the
course
of
trial.
our
grounds
for
mistrial
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis

francis

in
chambers.
“mr.
francis,
there
was
a
matter
i
wanted
to
bring
up
before
court
opens.”
that
is
that
there
are
two
articles
in
the
newspapers.
one,
in
yesterday
afternoon's
denver
post
and
the
other
in
this
morning's
news.
both
of
which
described
the
past
criminal
record
of
this
defendant.
i
noticed
when
i
came
in
this
morning
as
i
walked
by
the
jury
room,
the
jurors
had
several
rocky
mountain
and
we're
huddling
around
reading
it.
i
would
like
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
jurors
have
been
reading
the
articles
in
question.
i
believe
the
court
has
admonished
them
not
to
do
so.
the
court:
i
saw
the
articles
and
where
did
the
information
coming
from?
and
at
that
point,
the
government
concedes
to
having
spoken
to
newspapers
but
only
as
to
matters
that
had
gone
on
in
open
courts.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor
and
mr.
parrell
(ph)
and
mr.
hardy,
all
three
represented
the
government.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
and
then
the
counsel
likewise
asked
questions.
i
believe
i
asked
on
two
occasions
perhaps
three.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
interrogation
of
the
jurors,
your
honor
begins
at
page
39
and
goes
to
51.
all
12
jurors
were
brought
in.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
now,
this
court
as
far
as
defendant
has
been
able
to
determine
--
has
never
passed
upon
this
issue.
the
circuit
court
here
deemed
the
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
trail
court
although
the
circuit
court
opinion
in
the
instance
--
instant
case
conceded
that
there
might
be
instances
so
shocking
that
a
mistrial
would
have
to
be
declared
as
a
matter
of
course
citing
the
sheppard
case
and
one
or
two
others.
the
dissent
by
justice
murray
relied
on
the
fact
that
entrapment
was
an
issue
and
that
it
would
be
hard
to
rely
upon
the
defense
of
entrapment
that
no
jury
could
consider
the
defense
of
entrapment
with
these
newspaper
articles
in
mind.
and
secondly,
judge
murray
states
that
these
matters
being
inadmissible,
they
were
quote
"ineradicably
prejudicial".
in
other
words,
that
was
the
type
of
prejudice
in
his
opinion
that
could
not
be
raised.
mr.
george
j.
francis
your
honor,
i
was
--
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
dissenting
opinion
and
i
felt
that
the
position
of
entrapment
was
well
taken
as
well
as
the
position
that
this
was
ineradicably
prejudicial.
judge
murray
does
rely
more
on
the
entrapment
notion
although
he
also
says
that
trial
by
newspaper
is
not
tolerable.
he
takes
that
position
and
he
also
takes
--
states
in
any
event
he
would
reverse.
mr.
george
j.
francis
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
abandoning
it.
i'm
trying
to
perhaps
carry
water
on
both
shoulders
but
i
certainly
rely
on
the
notion
that
in
fact
it
was
one
of
the
matters
involved
as
well
as
the
fact
that
here
were
matters
ineradicably
prejudicial
which
should
not
had
come.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
correct
statement,
your
honor.
i
would
differ
with
the
statement
of
the
majority
for
this
reason.
the
burden
of
proof
of
course
was
on
the
government
and
the
government
would
have
had
to
prove
a
number
of
items.
one,
that
the
drug
had
traveled
into
interstate
commerce
and
that
was
under
heavy
attack.
two,
that
the
drug
was
identifiable
and
that
was
under
heavy
attack.
three,
that
this
was
a
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
because
in
this
type
of
case,
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
dexedrine
is
a
restricted
drug
but
proof
must
be
offered
by
experts
that
this
type
of
drug
is
a
drug
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
--
the
court
is
correct
if
it
wishes
to
state
it
this
way,
your
honor
that
entrapment
in
--
in
effect
was
the
only
affirmative
defense,
if
i've
answered
the
court's
question
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
he
does,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
assume
that
--
and
i
take
issue
with
it
that
this
man
is
guilty.
it's
the
only
way
i
can
read
it.
this
man
is
guilty
since
he
offered
no
defense
and
i
would
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
that
would
be
the
implication.
mr.
george
j.
francis
he
--
i
think
he
must
admit
that
he
does
rely
on
the
--
i
believe
the
pronunciation
is
(inaudible)
case
saying
that,
well,
when
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
overwhelming
or
something
that
thick
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
the
failure
to
make
a
defense
or
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
a
stand
was
certainly
not
a
concession
that
the
government's
case
was
right
or
we
would
never
been
in
court.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
defendant
would
simply
have
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
and
then
forgot
the
whole
matter.
mr.
george
j.
francis
well,
it
does.
that
position
does
militate,
it
seems
to
me
against
the
position
of
a
defendant
who
does
not
take
a
stand.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
position
of
the
defendant
actually
is
that
without
being
able
let
say
they
eavesdrop
on
the
jury
that
is
what
most
likely
or
probably
happens.
at
least
that
is
an
arguable
position
the
defendant
takes.
mr.
george
j.
francis
it's
never
been
determined
by
this
court.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
certainly
mean
it.
mr.
george
j.
francis
holt
case,
i
believe
your
honor
is
probably
one
of
the
most
misunderstood
cases
in
this
field
at
least
in
my
opinion.
i
had
originally
read
the
holt
case
and
as
i
had
in
the
maddox
and
the
maddox
case
gave
me
a
feeling
of
relation
for
a
while
until
i
found
out
that
they
ruled
on
another
grounds
but
the
holt
case
should
be
studied
very
carefully.
the
holt
case
comes
up
on
this
notion
that
the
jurors
and
attorney
for
the
defendant
submits
an
affidavit
in
which
he
states
“several
jurors
have
told
me
that
they
read
newspapers
with
articles
in
them
pertaining
to
the
case.”
now,
the
lower
court
avoids
the
difficulty
that
the
maddox
trial
court,
judge
entered
into
where
in
maddox,
the
trial
court
refused
to
consider
affidavits
and
this
court
said
“well
now,
you
failed
to
exercise
a
discretion.”
and
therefore
that
was
reversible
error
in
failing
to
consider.
the
trial
court
in
holt
states
that
he
considers
the
affidavits
and
nonetheless
rules
against
the
defendant.
mr.
george
j.
francis
pardon?
mr.
george
j.
francis
perhaps
the
trial
court
does
it
but
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
no,
your
honor.
actually,
what
trial
court
did
and
only
yesterday
i
had
the
chance
or
check
the
record
in
the
holt
case.
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
in
the
holt
case
stated
that
he
had
interrogated
two
jurors
who
stated
to
him
that
they
had
read
several
articles
in
the
seattle
newspapers.
and
the
defendant
--
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
now
is
making
the
affidavit
and
he
states
“i
don't
know
which
newspaper
articles
were
read.”
if
perhaps
all
of
them
are
read
and
he
requests
the
trial
court
in
the
holt
case
to
subpoena
the
two
jurors
to
make
the
determination.
and
the
trial
court
refuses
to
do
that.
the
trial
court
refuses
to
bring
in
the
jurors
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
had
read
specific
newspaper
articles.
then
the
government
in
their
briefs
in
that
case
as
well,
at
page
74
of
their
briefs
states
“but
the
affiant
was
unable
to
learn
from
this
jurors
which
articles
relating
to
the
trial
they
had
read
or
whether
they
had
read
all
of
them”.
the
court
treated
this
affidavit
as
stating
the
truth
and
refused
to
permit
counter
affidavits
to
be
filed.
it
therefore
was
not
made
to
appear
that
a
single
one
of
the
articles
of
which
complaint
is
made
was
ever
seen
by
either
of
the
jurors
during
the
progress
of
the
trial.
consequently,
plaintiff
is
in
error,
is
in
no
attitude
to
raise
a
question
whether
or
not
a
reading
of
such
articles
by
a
juror
would
constitute
a
reversible
error.
mr.
george
j.
francis
your
honor
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
beg
to
differ
with
you,
your
honor.
justice
holmes
states
that
the
trial
court
might
assume
that
but
this
court,
justice
holmes
said,
could
not
make
that
assumption
if
it
were
to
grant
a
new
trial.
and
then
justice
holmes
goes
on
to
state,
it
may
be
assumed,
he
says,
in
effect
and
this
is
set
forth
in
defendant's
reply
brief,
it
may
be
assumed
that
they
saw
something
of
the
public
prints.
mr.
george
j.
francis
pardon.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes.
and
the
assumption
is
this
gets
down
to
a
very
razor
like
analysis,
your
honor
but
i
think
i'm
right.
mr.
george
j.
francis
for
the
purpose
of
passing
on
the
permission
to
separate,
we'll
see
something
of
the
public
prints
is
so
obvious.
now,
the
mchenry
case
which
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
he
means
this
your
honor
that
it
is
assumed
that
people
will
read
newspapers
but
not
that
they
read
this
article.
the
circuit
court
in
the
--
the
mchenry
case
so
states
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
would
say
that
they
were.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
government's
brief
does
not
so
indicate
but
my
very
hurried
reading
yesterday
of
what
was
set
forth
in
the
record
indicated
to
me
that
there
were
rather
sensational
matters
that
were
contained
in
the
newspapers.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
of
the
--
the
appeal.
the
decision
states
the
--
the
defendant
is
up
on
three
points.
one
point
precisely
is
that
the
jury
was
permitted
to
separate
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
exactly,
your
honor
and
that
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
exactly,
that
could
be
my
interpretation.
mr.
george
j.
francis
that
would
be
my
--
i
think
that
would
be
my
very
firm
position
on
the
holt
case.
mr.
george
j.
francis
and
that
is
why
your
honor
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
and
that
is
why,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
when
justice
holmes,
and
this
is
a
misquoted
statement,
if
the
mere
opportunity
for
prejudice
or
corruption
is
to
raise
a
presumption
that
they
exist,
it
will
be
hard
to
maintain
jury
trial
under
the
conditions
of
the
present
date
is
a
misquoted
statement,
because
what
he
means
there
is
that
we
can't
assume
prejudice
if
we
assume
they
read
the
public
prints.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
see.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes.
well,
the
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
--
the
instruction
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
see.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
court
--
the
court's
instruction
was
that
when
being
separated,
they
would
not
read
matters.
they
would
not
discuss
the
case
with
anyone.
and
the
court
is
then
saying
--
this
court
is
then
saying,
“we
believe”
or
rather
the
trial
court
is
saying,
“i
believe
that
the
--
the
jurors
abided
by
that.”
mr.
george
j.
francis
not
to
see
it,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
he
trusts
that
they
will
not
look
at
it
because
he
refuses
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
he
assumes
that
they
saw
something
of
the
public
prints.
mr.
george
j.
francis
but
they
did
not.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
would
say
that
they
show
great
strength.
mr.
george
j.
francis
but
the
mchenry
case
your
honor
states
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
circuit
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
in
--
on
page
3
of
the
reply
brief
of
this
defendant.
at
page
764,
the
circuit
court
there
says,
referring
to
the
holt
case.
the
court
remarked
that
where
jurors
were
permitted
to
separate,
it
was
assume
--
safe
to
assume
that
they
saw
something
of
the
public
press.
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
under
this
assumption,
error
had
been
committed
in
failing
to
keep
the
jury
in
the
custody
of
the
marshall.
there
was
no
proof
that
any
of
them
had
read
it,
referring
to
the
facts
in
that
case.
we
may
assume
that
they
saw
something
of
the
public
press
as
was
said
in
the
holt
case,
but
not
that
they
saw
any
particular
article
in
a
particular
newspaper.
the
near
opportunity
to
see
it
raises
no
presumption
that
it
was
seen
and
i
think
that
is
what
justice
holmes
meant
when
he
said
that
the
opportunity
for
prejudice
or
corruption
is
not
enough.
mr.
george
j.
francis
mchenry
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
--
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
and
further
justification
can
be
found
in
that.
and
that,
of
all
the
cases
that
the
government
cites
on
pages
18
and
19
of
their
brief,
not
one
cites
the
whole
case
to
that
effect.
in
other
words,
we
would
expect
that
the
circuit
courts
would
have
rushed
to
cite
the
whole
case
and
say,
“well
now,
this
is
a
matter
of
discretionary
with
the
trial
court.”
see
holt
versus
the
united
states,
218
united
states
page
245,
250,
251,
but
they
don't
do
that.
three
cases
mentioned
it,
but
in
a
different
connection.
one
as
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
denying
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
the
second,
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
withdrawing
a
juror
which
was
a
matter
that
hit
--
been
handled
by
the
holt
case
namely
that
a
juror
was
not
withdrawn
and
that
was
an
error
alleged
by
the
defendant.
but
the
juror
was
not
withdrawn,
not
because
of
the
reading
of
the
newspaper
but
because
of
something
else.
and
if
i
may
elucidate
just
a
little
more
on
the
holt
decision,
justice
holmes
says,
“the
judge
did
not
reject
the
affidavit,”
but
decided
against
the
motion
on
the
assumption
that
more
than
it
ventured
to
allege
was
true.
and
i
submit
the
rational
explanation
of
that
that
more
than
it
ventured
to
allege
was
true
was
simply
this.
the
affidavit
ventured
to
allege
that
cert
--
that
newspaper
articles
had
been
read,
but
he
--
the
affiant
couldn't
say
which
ones,
hoping
that
he
could
somehow
induce
the
trial
court
to
get
the
jurors
in
court
and
find
out
which
ones.
more
than
it
ventured
to
allege
means
that
it
ventures
to
allege
that
certain
--
that
articles
were
read
without
being
able
to
say
in
the
affidavit
which
ones
and
the
court
would
not
assume
that
the
detrimental
ones
were
the
ones
that
had
been
read.
actually,
the
holt
case
came
up
because
until
that
point,
he
was
doubtful
whether
or
not
a
jury
was
permitted
to
separate
in
a
capital
case.
and
the
holt
case
or
the
federal
circuits
disposed
of
that
question
by
saying
that
it
was
permissible
in
capital
cases
to
permit
the
jury
to
separate
and
that
the
court
had
discretion
to
permit
the
jury
to
separate.
in
this
instance,
it
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
permitting
the
jury
to
separate
nor
did
it
abuse
its
discretion
for
denying
a
motion
for
new
trial,
the
grounds
of
which
was
that
the
court
had
permitted
the
jury
to
separate.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes.
mr.
george
j.
francis
there
are
quite
a
few
cases.
mr.
george
j.
francis
they
are
submitted
partially
in
both
briefs,
your
honor.
they
are
also
submitted
in
one
of
the
alrs
that
is
cited
in
the
brief,
31
alr
second.
they're
collected
at
length.
mr.
george
j.
francis
31
alr
second
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
would
say
31
alr
second,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
page
417.
mr.
george
j.
francis
they
are
cases
on
both
sides.
some
which
state
that
general
prejudicial
items
are
not
grounds
for
new
trial
unless
a
juror
admits
to
prejudice.
i
might
add
as
a
footnote
here.
i
have
never
read
one
case
on
either
side
in
which
a
juror
admitted
prejudice,
not
one
case.
mr.
george
j.
francis
none
that
i
found,
your
honor.
but
the
cases
run
from
where
there
are
mere
comments
on
the
course
of
trial
and
motion
for
new
trial
is
not
denied.
there
are
cases
where
mere
comments
which
are
not
prejudicial
on
their
face
are
still
considered
grounds
for
new
trial.
we
have
this
fact
that
not
one
case
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
outside
of
the
riley
case
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
in
which
a
past
criminal
record
was
read
by
a
jury.
all
of
those
cases
except
the
riley
case
granted
new
trial
or
mistrial.
mr.
george
j.
francis
they
are
state
court
decisions
and
two
federal
district
court.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
believe
that
that
is
the
predominant
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
--
position
that
the
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
based
upon
statements
made
to
him
by
jurors
who
are
under
somewhat
of
addressed.
mr.
george
j.
francis
if
i
might
comment
on
that
your
honor
as
my
time
is
running
out.
there
has
been
statements
by
judges
that
a
juror's
statement
that
he
is
not
influenced
should
be
considered
in
light
of
the
fact
that
he
has
committed
an
impropriety
and
naturally
he
is
most
hesitant
therefore
to
go
very
far.
in
other
words,
he
is
placed
in
the
--
the
--
the
position
of
having
to
defend
an
impropriety.
mr.
george
j.
francis
well,
your
honor
i
suppose
several
methods
of
approach.
one
might
be
that
--
this
honorable
court
might
be
a
little
more
strict
as
to
the
violations
by
newspapers
that
is
to
say
by
citations
for
contempt,
because
it's
an
interference
with
the
jury
trial
in
this
instance
and
the
contempt
cases,
this
honorable
court
has
ruled
upon
our
cases
triable
to
a
court
not
to
a
jury
and
therefore
contempt
cases
might
be
broaden
or
made
more
liberal
where
the
jury
is
involved.
mr.
george
j.
francis
well,
i
think
that
the
separation
of
the
jury
is
not
the
only
method
of
solving
the
problem,
your
honor.
i
had
--
i
made
a
brief
mention
in
the
brief
--
in
my
brief,
“why
not
just
cite
the
newspaper
in
who
committed
the
offense?”
and
hold
the
hearing
and
then
state,
“well,
we
find
that
your
--
your
conduct
although
not
in
contempt
of
this
court
deprive
this
person
of
a
new
trial
and
we
have
all
this
additional
cost
for
new
--
for
the
old
trial
and
we're
going
to
tax
those
costs
to
you.
after
all,
it's
nothing,
but
advertising
for
you
and
it's
no
more
than
a
cost
of
advertising.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
would
say
that
the
--
there
is
no
real
practical
guarantee
that
these
matters
not
come
from
to
a
jury's
attention
except
by
enclosing
the
jury.
that
i
would
say
but
that
you
can
try
to
curb
the
influence
of
media
communication
either
through
a
tightening
of
the
contempt
citations
or
taxing
for
costs.
practically,
that
would
be
it.
mr.
george
j.
francis
well,
your
honor
if
they
are
permitted
to
roam
the
street
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor
there
is
that
danger.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
but
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
but
may
i
comment
on
that,
your
honor?
perhaps
we
are
worrying
too
much
as
to
an
imposition
on
the
freedom
to
publish
which
will
--
which
is
not
involved
here.
what
is
involved
here
is
that
actually
a
man
may
have
been
deprived
of
a
pretrial
and
then
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
pre-press
anymore
than
as
if
i
had
typed
this
information
as
a
third
person
and
slipped
it
into
the
pockets
of
the
jurors
during
the
course
of
trial.
the
net
effect
is
still
that
my
client
has
been
deprived
of
the
right
that
the
jury
listened
only
to
what
is
presented
in
open
courts.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor,
i
would.
mr.
george
j.
francis
well,
i
might
quibble
on
that
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
actually,
for
all
intention
purposes
in
denver,
there
is
the
denver
post
in
the
rocky
mountain
news.
mr.
george
j.
francis
we
have
radio
stations
but
those
are
monitored
out
of
denver
for
the
most
part.
mr.
george
j.
francis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
on
entrapment?
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
no,
there
was
no
reference
made
to
that
point
at
all.
now
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
no,
your
honor.
but
if
i
might
just
reduce
one
point
which
is
of
interest,
we
assume
that
--
we
have
to
assume
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
i
suppose
that
the
jury
listened
to
the
trial
court
and
that
it
becomes
important
because
the
trial
court
it
says
their
demeanor
indicates
to
me
that
they're
not
going
to
violate
anything.
but
notice
and
this
was
a
matter
in
a
--
that
i
noticed
only
after
reading
the
brief
--
the
record
several
times.
on
page
40
of
the
record,
the
court
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
40,
your
honor.
the
court
states
to
the
second
juror.
now,
this
is
the
second
juror
who
has
been
brought
in
to
chambers.
mr.
parrell
(ph)
who's
the
government
attorney
says,
“i
wonder
whether
or
not
the
court
would
want
to
instruct
each
juror
not
to
discuss
the
article
or
its
contents
as
they
go
back.”
and
the
court
says,
“yes,
i
think
that
is
proper,
but
i
thought
i
would
give
them
that
in
a
general
instruction
not
to
give
consideration
to
that.”
but
of
course,
he's
talking
to
the
juror
now.
you
shouldn't
discuss
among
yourselves
anything
about
this
article.
now,
the
ninth
juror
walks
into
chambers
--number
nine
which
is
seven
jurors
later
at
page
48.
and
she
says
she
hasn't
discussed
--
she
hasn't
read
these
articles,
but
she
says
--
the
court
says,
“has
anyone
talked
to
you
about
either
one
of
the
items?”
mrs.
bush:
no.
the
court:
no
one
has
mentioned
it
to
you?
mrs.
bush:
no,
sir.
the
court:
no
one
said
that
there
was
a
piece
in
the
blank.
mrs.
bush:
they
have
been
chatting
in
the
room
where
the
jurors
are
now
since
they
had
been
called
in
here.
so,
that
reflects
upon
how
the
juror
listens
to
that.
it
is
justice
frank
has
stated
in
his
dissent
in
the
leviton
case.
it's
like
telling
a
boy
to
go
sit
in
a
corner
and
not
think
of
a
white
elephant.
mr.
george
j.
francis
she
states
that
the
article
was
being
mentioned.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
not
what
was
in
it,
but
how
far
can
we
go
beyond
that.
thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
francis
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
reply
to
several
points
that
the
counsel
of
the
government
raised.
the
counsel
for
the
government
indicates
in
his
statements
that
the
article
is
prejudicial
in
itself.
now,
on
the
face
of
it,
now
it's
hard
to
examine
the
mind
of
a
jury
especially
from
a
record
as
brief
as
this.
i've
tried
to
go
into
that
yesterday
evening,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
government
counsel
referred
to
as
one
of
the
three
questions
as
an
indication
of
how
agreeable
the
jury
was
to
give
any
answer
that
would
not
show
that
they
had
prejudiced
in
their
mind.
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
show
in
one
instance
how
ridiculous
their
position
was.
the
court
asked,
most
of
those
who
read
this
one
question,
was
there
anything
in
that
articles
that
would
prejudice
you
against
the
defendant?
well
it
would
seem
to
me
the
obvious
answer
is
yes
there
is
something
in
that
article
that
would
prejudice
but
i
am
not
prejudiced.
but
all
of
them,
very
flat-footedly
said
why
there
is
nothing
in
that
article
that
would
prejudice
mean.
on
the
face
of
it,
that's
an
impossible
position
because
reading
the
article,
no
person
could
fail
but
to
see
that
the
article
in
its
very
nature
was
of
a
prejudicial
sort.
as
to
how
reliable
the
jury
is
again
we
only
have
a
very
brief
record.
but
the
government
counsel
refers
to
one
party
who
didn't
read
the
newspaper
at
all
and
he
is
not
counted
as
one
of
the
six
who
read
because
her
statement
was,
i
scanned
it,
and
therefore
in
the
petitioner's
count
hypnosis
she
was
omitted.
but
listen
to
how
reliable
the
jury
is
herself
at
page
44
of
the
record.
mrs.
(inaudible),
the
only
thing
he
told
me
was
that
the
jury
has
been
selected
and
so
many
women
and
so
many
men
and
he
said
i
suppose
this
means
you,
this
is
the
case
you
are
on
and
he
didn't
tell
me
anything
further
than
that
and
he
knew
that
i'm
not
suppose
to
read
newspaper
pieces
and
i
glanced
at
the
headlines
of
it
and
scanned
it.
here,
the
lady
admits
that
she
knows
that
something
is
improper
and
then
goes
on
to
state
that
despite
that
i
went
ahead
and
scanned
it.
it's
her
own
admission.
mr.
george
j.
francis
your
honor,
i
believe
they
were.
mr.
george
j.
francis
no.
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor
they
are
not.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes.
counsel
and
i
summed
up
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
i
was
the
only
counsel
in
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
mr.
george
j.
francis
certainly.
i
would
hand
it
on
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
further
than
just
that
there
was
an
issue
of
fact.
mr.
george
j.
francis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes
because
--
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
of
course
the
issue
of
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law
was
raised
by
defendant
principally
because
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
no
rebuttal
evidence.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
second
day,
your
honor.
the
first
day
was
involved
in
the
examination
of
the
principal
witness,
the
agent.
the
court
recessed
after
several
other
witnesses
had
testified.
the
next
day,
these
matters
came
up.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
we
had
one
mistrial
and
then
it
began
over
again.
mr.
george
j.
francis
then
it
began
again
over
again
and
then
i
believe
there
were
three
days
of
testimony
in
all
although
i'm
--
i
can't
be
sure
and
i
think
we
--
we
address
the
jury
the
fourth
day.
now,
i
--
that's
just
my
recollection.
mr.
george
j.
francis
it's
not
in
the
record
but
i
can
certainly
state.
mr.
george
j.
francis
yes,
your
honor.
they
went
out
to
lunch
and
came
back.
in
other
words,
closing
argument,
i
opened
and
closed
and
i
closed
about
five
minutes
to
12.
the
jury
went
out
to
lunch
and
when
they
came
back
within
minutes
they
had
the
bailiff
informed
the
court
that
a
verdict
had
been
reached.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
voir
dire,
your
honor,
occupied
morning.
mr.
george
j.
francis
the
practice
in
them
your
honor
is
for
the
court
to
interrogate
and
not
for
counsel.
mr.
george
j.
francis
my
recollection
is
that
--
my
recollection
is
your
honor
that
we
had
about
one
hour
of
the
agent's
testimony
on
direct
before
recess
for
lunch.
mr.
george
j.
francis
judge
(inaudible)
usually
begins
approximately
9
to
9:30,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
would
say
that
the
voir
dire
took
a
period
of
approximately
an
hour.
mr.
george
j.
francis
judge
(inaudible)
the
questions
being
from
counsel
--
rather
from
the
court
are
rather
quick
and
short.
my
time
has
expired,
your
honors.
i
would
have
like
to
have
answered
the
four
cases
because
they
are
very
materially
distinguishable.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
george
j.
francis
thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
francis
i
only
felt
was
that
i
could
easily
distinguish.
mr.
george
j.
francis
thank
you,
your
honor.
