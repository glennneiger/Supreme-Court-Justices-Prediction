justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
applying
with
prejudice,
i
take
it
as
a
phase
where
you
rely
very
heavily
on
the
fact
that
this
is
in
a
context
of
an
entrapment
of
defendant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
might
not
have
been
here
whether
you
like
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
much
of
judge
murray's
argument
though
i've
gathered
the
way
you're
arguing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
only
thing
that
differentiates
this
case
of
ordinary
situation
where
a
newspaper
gets
into
a
jury
room
and
shouldn't
have
got
in
there
and
then
the
judges
instructs
the
jury
and
admonishes
them
and
it's
a
very
grievous
case,
we
leave
that
sort
of
thing
normally
to
a
jury
--
to
the
judge
but
you've
got
a
special
kind
of
a
case
here.
at
least
it
seems
to
me
you
had
where
--
because
of
the
defense
which
you
interpose.
that's
why
i'm
so
surprise
that
you
throw
it
down.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down.
is
there
anymore
of
the
charge
printed
on
what
appears
on
page
38
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
other
ordes
that
the
entire
charge
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
of
entrapment,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is.
and
there's
nothing
you
said
in
there
as
to
what
bearing
if
any
of
bad
criminal
record
he
might
have
had.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
bearing
do
you
think
the
entrapment
offense
has
on
your
case?
or
let
me
put
it
more
specifically,
assuming
once
you
come
to
conclusion
that
there
was
an
issue
here
as
to
entrapment
that
was
properly
submitted
to
the
jury,
what
would
you
say
then
as
to
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
how
long
the
jury
was
out?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
this
issue
of
entrapment
having
gone
to
the
jury,
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
the
defendant
be
under
some
constraint
in
asking
what
will
be
the
normal
charge
and
the
record
as
this
one
would
have
shown
no
prior
criminal
record.
it
was
under
some
constraint
in
asking
for
such
a
charge
in
view
of
this
newspaper
i
presume,
wasn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
assuming
that
he
was
entitled
of
the
charge
for
the
moment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
i
have
to
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
counsel
would
have
thought
several
times
knowing
that
the
newspaper
articles
have
gone
in
to
ask
the
court
the
charge
that
they
could
take
in
to
account
the
fact
on
a
predisposition
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
man
had
a
criminal
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
summations
of
counsel,
were
they
taken
down
stenographically?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
they
in
this
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
sum
up
on
the
issue
of
the
profit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
no
objection,
i
personally
would
like
to
see
the
summations
if
they're
available.
