county
of
allegheny,
petitioner,
versus
frank
mashuda
company.
mr.
baskin
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
in
the
record
what,
what
purpose
it
was
for,
what
private
purpose
it
was
claimed
it
was?
chief

what
it
is
â€“-
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
only
non
public
purpose
that
is
alleged,
just
a
temporary
use
of
it
by
the
contractor
for
the
construction
of
the
airport?
chief
justice
earl

instead
of
filing
the
suit
in
the
federal
court,
the
defendants
in
the
common
law
--
common
pleas
court
had
moved
to
remove
it
to
the
federal
court
on
grounds
of
the
first,
could
have
they
have
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
simply
a
diversity
case.
chief

mr.
schmidt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schmidt
may
i
ask
you
this,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
doubted
if
you
could
raise
the
question
of
private
use,
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
this
condemnation
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
correct,
all
right,
now
suppose
this
case
had
gone
to
final
judgment,
the
condemnation
suit
in
the
state
court,
and
thereafter
you
had
learned
about
this
use
that
you
are
speaking
of,
would
there
then
under
pennsylvania
law
been
available
to
you
an
action
of
ejectment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
in
agreement
on
that
are
you,
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
and
yourself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
just
like
to
ask
counsel
if
he
agrees
with
that
statement.
now
i
understood
you
to
say
the
opposite,
i
may
have
been
mistaken.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
file
it
now,
there
is
no
objection.
very
well
