mr.
philip
baskin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
the
certiorari
granted
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
action
of
the
district
court,
sitting
at
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania,
which
had
sustained
a
motion
by
the
county
of
allegheny
to
dismiss
the
complaint
filed
by
the
respondents
who
were
the
plaintiffs
below.
now
the
creasy
case
which
was
heard
just
before
this
case
discussed
the
question
of
a
road
leading
to
the
airport,
which
takes
us
right
to
the
airport
itself.
the
plaintiffs
complained
below,
and
had
alleged
that
the
county
of
allegheny
had
taken
their
property,
purportedly
for
airport
purposes,
but
in
fact
there
was
a
taking
for
a
private
purpose,
and
that
since
it
was
not
a
public
purpose
that
taking
was
invalid.
they,
therefore,
asked
for
the
following
relief.
plaintiff
stated
wherefore
the
plaintiff
demands
judgment
of
ouster
and
damages
against
the
two
defendants,
in
addition,
or
in
the
alternative
plaintiffs
demand
an
injunction
restraining
the
county
of
allegheny,
from
proceeding
further
against
plaintiffs
in
the
court
of
common
plea
in
regard
to
the
said
man
and
a
re-conveyance
to
the
land
to
which
the
county
had
wrongfully
acquired
title.
in
short
the
bill
of
complaint
asked
for
a
stay
of
a
pending
court
proceeding
in
which
the
parties
were
then
involved.
the
county
of
allegheny
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
motion
was
based
on
the
following
grounds.
first,
at
section
2283
of
28
u.s.c.
prevented
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
against
a
pending
state
court
proceeding
and
that
therefore
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
the
second
ground
given
for
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
that
this
condemnation
proceeding
in
a
state
court
was
an
in
rem
action
and
that
the
state
court
having
acquired
jurisdiction
over
the
raise,
it
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
that
the
district
court
could
not
entertain
an
action
which
had
to
concern
itself
with
a
title
to
the
land.
the
county,
however,
went
further
in
its
motion
to
dismiss.
it
said
assuming
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
pending
proceeding
in
a
state
court
and
the
parties
before
the
district
court
with
the
same
parties
before
the
state
court
proceeding
and
since
there
was
a
question
that
the
state
law
involved
that
the
plaintiffs
should
have
raised
that
question
of
the
invalidity
of
the
taking
first
in
the
state
court
proceeding
and
that
therefore
the
district
court
should
refrain
from
exercise
its
jurisdiction.
the
motion
to
dismiss
also
stated
that
there
was
no
basis
for
the
cause
of
action,
but
that
is
not
relevant
to
this
appeal.
now
the
facts
which
brought
this
case
to
the
district
court
are
quite
simple,
because
all
that
we
have
in
here
really
is
aggrieved
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
board
of
county
commissioner
of
alleghany
county,
pursuant
to
their
powers
under
the
second
class
code,
had
passed
a
resolution
in
june
of
1955,
condemning
various
properties
for
use
for
the
greater
pittsburgh
airport.
included
in
these
properties
were
8
acres
which
were
owned
by
the
mashudas
who
are
the
respondents
in
this
case.
the
county
then
petitioned
for
a
board
of
viewers
and
in
march
of
1956
a
board
of
viewers
came
in
with
an
award
of
approximately
$52,000
for
the
property.
the
county
appealed
that
award,
claiming
that
the
award
was
excessive.
the
property
owners
appealed
claiming
that
it
was
an
adequate
and
the
case
was
then
set
at
issue
before
the
court
of
common
pleas.
this
case
was
set
at
issue
in
the
early
court
of
1957,
which
was
almost
two
years
after
the
original
resolution
and
approximately
18
months
after
the
petition
for
the
appointment
of
viewers.
then
in
may
of
1957,
the
respondents,
plaintiffs
below,
went
into
the
district
court
and
claimed
for
the
first
time
that
the
taking
by
the
county
was
improper
in
that
we
were
using
it
not
for
a
public
purpose,
not
for
airport
purposes,
but
for
a
private
purpose.
i
think
before
going
into
the
argument
on
the
case
it
might
be
well
to
review
very
briefly
the
procedure
for
eminent
domain
in
pennsylvania
some
of
which
was
covered
in
the
preceding
argument.
mr.
philip
baskin
yes
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
baskin
what
happened
was
that
they
added
as
a
defendant,
in
the
district
court
proceedings,
a
contractor
who
the
county
had
issued
a
contract
to
for
construction
of
part
of
the
airport
paving
and
the
county
had
also
licensed
the
contractor
to
use
a
certain
portion
of
the
mashuda
property
temporarily
for
storage
purposes
for
his
materials
during
his
construction
contract.
now,
we
have
attached
that
license
that
the
county
gave
this
contractor
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
it
is
in
the
record
and
that
temporary
license
that
was
given
to
him
was
given
to
him
more
than
a
year
after
the
original
taking.
however,
since
the
complaint
states
that
it
was
for
a
private
purpose
which
we
say
it
on
its
face
is
shown
not
to
be
and
since
we
moved
to
dismiss
we
are
proceeding
with
the
case
as
though
there
was
some
grounds
for
the
allegation
that
there
was
a
taking
for
a
non
public
purpose.
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
as
far
as
we
conceive
from
the
complaint
that's
all
that
there
is.
i
think
in
fairness
to
plaintiffs
they
did
make
an
allegation
that
the
county
had
no
plan
for
using
this
property
other
than
this
plan
to
temporarily
lease
it
for
this
contractor.
that
was
really
the
reason
why
we
added
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
fact
that
because
of
that,
there
was
no
cause
of
action
in
the
case,
that
on
its
face
there
was,
and
there
was
no
basis
for
action.
however,
that
is
not
before
the
court
and
it
wasn't
before
the
court
of
appeal
below.
mr.
philip
baskin
yes
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
philip
baskin
i
think
the
law
is
that
we
cannot
take
property
for
a
private
purpose.
mr.
philip
baskin
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
in
pennsylvania
the
land
must
be
taken
for
a
public
purpose.
now
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
we
say
that
under
law
of
pennsylvania
that's
determined
in
the
board
of
viewers
proceedings,
in
other
words
condemnation
proceeding
as
such.
mr.
philip
baskin
i'm
going
to
deal
with
it
right
now.
what
happens
is,
once
a
resolution
is
passed
condemning
property
there
is
an
appointment
of
viewers
made
by
the
court
of
common
plea.
the
viewers
then
consider
what
is
taken,
what
is
not
been
taken
and
then
hands
down
an
award.
from
that
award
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
which
appointed
the
board
in
the
first
instance
and
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
you
can
raise
any
questions,
it's
almost
a
de
novo
proceeding.
from
there
you
can
appeal
to
the
appellate
courts
of
pennsylvania
as
in
any
other
case.
now,
the
peculiar
thought
about
this
case
that
makes
its
so
different
from
any
other
case
that
we
can
find
either
in
federal
law
or
state
law,
is
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
a
federal
court
has
taken
action
concerning
title
to
property
which
is
then
involved
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
which
has
been
going
in
the
state
court.
all
the
cases
that
we
have
been
to
find
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
have
held
flatly
that
when
the
condemnation
proceeding
is
pending
in
the
state
court,
that
the
district
court
will
not
interfere
with
that
state
proceeding.
mr.
philip
baskin
yes
sir.
the
original
condemnation
resolution
was
in
june
of
1955.
the
viewers
were
appointed
shortly
thereafter
and
in
march
of
1956
the
viewers
handed
down
their
award.
then
there
was
an
appeal
--
mr.
philip
baskin
it
was
not
raised.
what
happened
--
mr.
philip
baskin
no
what
happened
your
honor
was
this,
that
in
a
petition
which
was
subsequently
filed
from
the
award
of
the
viewers,
the
plaintiff
themselves
avert
that
the
condemnation
resolution
was
duly
adopted
in
conformity
with
the
second
class
county
code.
mr.
philip
baskin
before
the
common
pleas
review,
in
other
words
after
the
award
of
the
viewers
which
was
in
march
of
1956,
within
30
days
there
were
appeals
filed
by
the
county
and
the
property
owners.
at
no
time
have
the
property
owners
raised
this
question
of
the
invalidity
of
taking
either
in
the
viewers'
proceedings
or
in
the
pending
court
of
common
pleas
proceeding.
the
case
was
then
set
down
for
issue
and
would
have
been
tried
except
for
this
proceeding
in
the
district
court
which
was
instituted
in
may
of
1957.
mr.
philip
baskin
the
award
was
in
march
of
1956,
so
within
30
days
there
was
an
appeal
filed.
now
this
case
was
then
pre-tried.
it
is
not
shown
in
the
record
but
it
was
pre-tried
and
set
for
trial
and
we
have
an
order
of
court
which
i
like
to
file
with
the
court
since
it's
coming
up
by
the
court
of
common
pleas.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
signed
by
judge
alpern
who
is
now
the
attorney
general
alpern,
who
argued
preceding
case,
and
the
order
of
court
states
that
the
reason
for
not
proceeding
to
trial
with
the
issue
was
the
fact
that
the
attorney
for
the
property
owners
came
in
and
asked
that
it
be
postponed
pending
the
determination
of
the
federal
court
proceeding.
mr.
philip
baskin
and
that
was
in
--
mr.
philip
baskin
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
baskin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
baskin
there
was
a
pre-trial
postponed
until
november
1956.
then
there
was
a
trial,
a
trail
set
for
march
11,
1957,
which
was
postponed
until
may
14,
1957.
and
it
was
in
may
of
1957
then
that
this
federal
court
action
was
instituted
and
on
the
basis
of
that
federal
court
action
the
plaintiffs
asked
the
state
court
to
stay
its
proceeding
pending
a
determination
of
the
federal
--
mr.
philip
baskin
oh
no,
we
never
agreed
with
that
your
honor.
now
if
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
they
might
--
mr.
philip
baskin
yes,
they
might
have
been
able
to
do
it
had
they
done
it
properly,
that
is
within
the
30
days
after
the
appeal
was
filed
with
the
court
of
common
pleas,
but
this
case
was
filed
in
a
district
court
almost
a
year
after
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
the
removal
of
jurisdiction
would
be
lacking.
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
mr.
justice
douglas
that's
the
crux
of
this
case.
we
say
that
it
could
be
tried
there,
in
fact
we
say
that
it
can't
be
tried
anywhere
else
and
we
say
that
the
board
of
viewers
proceedings
concerns
itself
not
merely
with
an
award
of
damages,
but
with
any
question
of
law
relating
to
the
taking
for
example.
mr.
philip
baskin
that's
correct
your
honor.
what
we
we're
saying
is
this,
that
when
a
board
of
viewers
makes
an
award
of
damages,
that
it
must
be
predicated
upon
a
lawful
taking,
otherwise
the
award
itself
is
a
void
act,
but
what
happens
in
these
viewers
proceeding
is
ordinarily
there
is
an
allegation
made
as
there
was
in
these
proceedings
that
the
taking
was
in
conformity
with
law.
nobody
objects
to
that
allegation,
therefore
all
that
happens
is
that
viewers
go
along
and
award
damages.
occasionally
--
mr.
philip
baskin
just
the
damages
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
--
mr.
philip
baskin
that's
correct,
but
what
we
are
saying
they
could
have
raised
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
we
say
that
they
could
have
and
we
say
that
the
pennsylvania
law
says
that
it
is
must
be
raised
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
philip
baskin
we
believe
they
would
have,
yes.
we
say
that
in
order
to
award
damages,
they
must
be
grounded
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
a
taking.
it
must
be
a
lawful
taking
otherwise
i
don't
see
how
the
award
could
be
lawful.
now
in
most
cases
nobody
contests
the
taking,
but
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
it's
--
we
say
that
it's
a
determination
which
is
inherent
in
the
award
when
nobody
raises
the
question.
mr.
philip
baskin
it's
a
quasi
judicial
body
your
honor
in
pennsylvania,
it's
an
arm
of
the
court
of
common
pleas,
it's
appointed
by
the
court
of
common
pleas.
it
has
power
to
make
findings
and
give
an
award
which
is
binding,
unless
it's
appealed
from
to
the
court
of
common
pleas,
so
in
that
sense
it's
a
quasi
judicial
body.
mr.
philip
baskin
when
it
comes
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
--
mr.
philip
baskin
we
believe
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
we
believe
that
it's
jurisdictional
because
if
there
hasn't
been
a
proper
taking
then
there
is
no
power
to
making
an
award
and
we
say
--
mr.
philip
baskin
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
no
we
do
not
admit
that
your
honor.
we
say
that
in
pennsylvania
once
condemnation
proceedings
have
commenced,
that
you
can't
bring
it
in
an
independent
suit
and
that's
where
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
we
believe
was
erroneous
in
its
judgment.
the
circuit
of
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
you
could
bring
an
independent
action
in
the
state
court,
the
test
of
validity
of
the
taking,
that
there
being
diversity
of
citizenship
you
could
bring
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
we
say
that
under
pennsylvania
law
you
must
bring
it
in
the
present
state
proceeding.
now
we
went
further
than
that.
we
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
the
spann
case,
your
honor
was
a
district
court
--
a
case
of
a
school
district
in
which
that
question
was
not
raised.
nobody
raised
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
that
case.
it
was
brought
before
the
equity
court
and
the
court
decided,
but
i
think
if
you
read
that
case
you
will
see
that
nobody
questioned
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
none
of
the
parties
did
and
the
court
went
ahead
and
decided
the
case
--
mr.
philip
baskin
they
entertained
the
suit,
but
that
was
also
before
the
gardener
case
which
we
refer
to
in
our
brief.
now
what
we
are
--
mr.
philip
baskin
that's
correct.
now
what
--
mr.
philip
baskin
that's
correct.
now
i
would
like
to
direct
this
to
mr.
justice
douglas
to
point
out
what
could
conceivably
happen
here.
the
circuit
court
in
effect
said
in
its
opinion
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
pending
state
court
to
try
this
question
of
the
validity
of
the
taking,
that's
really
what
they
grounded
their
opinion
on.
now
they
are
at
best
guessing
at
what
the
state
supreme
court
would
say
would
be
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
now
let's
assume
that
the
present
state
proceeding
goes
on
to
a
conclusion
and
that
we
take
the
position
in
the
pending
state
court
proceeding
that
this
question
could
have
been
raised
and
the
state
supreme
court
says
yes
it
could
have
been
raised
because
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
to
entertain
it,
not
having
been
raised
it's
res
judicata.
now
we
have
then
a
situation
wherein
the
state
court
we
have
res
judicata
because
the
issue
wasn't
raised,
at
the
same
time
we
have
a
federal
suit
progressing
which
is
entertaining
the
very
question
which
the
state
supreme
court
says
was
foreclosed
in
the
state
court
action.
now
i
am
not
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
but
it
may
and
the
very
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
a
very
interesting
question
would
arise
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
when
it
goes
to
adjudication
and
not
having
been
raised,
will
it
then
be
res
judicata
and
what
will
be
its
effect
against
any
decision
that
the
district
court
might
make
concerning
the
invalidity
of
the
taking.
i
think
we
have
that
question
of
--
mr.
philip
baskin
no,
no,
that
is
not
the
ground.
mr.
philip
baskin
we
are
only
suggesting
that
is
one
of
the
questions
which
will
be
raised
subsequently
if
we
permit
this
district
court
proceeding
to
go
on.
now
we
say
that
the
lower
court
had
no
jurisdiction
because
of
section
2283
of
28
u.s.c.
which
states
that
you
cannot
enjoin
a
pending
state
court
proceeding.
now
the
relief
that
was
requested
before
the
district
court
asked
for
that
in
those
very
words.
it
says
wherefore
plaintiffs
demand
judgment
of
ouster,
and
in
addition
or
in
the
alternative
an
injunction
restraining
the
county
of
allegheny
from
proceeding
further.
now
the
i
think
in
this
very
language,
the
relief
places
itself
within
section
2283,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
the
plaintiffs
were
abandoning
all
thoughts
of
equitable
relief
and
were
asking
only
for
ouster
which
would
be
what
they
consider
an
action
of
ejectment.
however,
we
say
that
even
if
we
would
presuppose
that
the
plaintiffs
had
abandoned
that
relief
which
would
not
abandon
in
the
district
court
that
there
is
no
difference
between
ordering
the
county
of
allegheny
to
leave
the
property
or
ordering
them
not
to
take
any
further
steps
in
connection
with
that
property
and
the
cases
are
quite
clear
that
if
the
result
of
a
district
court
action
has
the
same
result
as
an
injunction
against
pending
state
court
proceedings
that
the
section
2283
comes
into
play.
now
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
many
cases
in
which
other
circuits
have
entertained
this
exact
situation
that
is
where
condemnation
proceedings
were
pending
and
a
claim
was
made
in
the
district
court
that
the
taking
was
invalid
because
it
wasn't
for
a
public
purpose.
and
in
each
one
of
those
cases
the
circuit
court
has
held
that
section
2283
prevents
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
but
we
are
prepared
to
go
even
further.
we
are
prepared
to
say
that
even
if
section
2283
were
not
here
involved
and
it
was
just
a
question
of
whether
the
district
court
should
exercise
its
jurisdiction
or
not
that
there
are
very
cogent
reasons
why
it
shouldn't
because
if
the
state
court,
if
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
the
state
court
and
say
here
is
our
question
will
you
handle
it
and
the
state
court
says
yes,
we
will,
there
isn't
a
single
federal
question
that's
left
open,
there
is
no
question
of
whether
section
2283
applies
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
of
whether
this
is
an
in
rem
proceeding,
in
other
words
all
the
many
questions
that
have
been
raised
in
this
proceeding
disappear.
but
if
the
district
court
says
that
we
will
try
the
case,
then
all
these
questions
remain
and
also
this
question
that
i
presented
before
of
what
will
happen
eventually
if
the
state
court
proceeding
goes
to
award
of
damages
and
the
federal
court
proceeding
goes
on
to
a
judgment
of
ouster
and
you
have
an
award
of
damages
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
in
one
court
and
another
court
those
same
plaintiff
saying
that
the
land
was
not
taken
and
they
are
entitled
to
the
land
which
prevails
and
which
has
the
effect
of
res
judicata.
now
all
we
are
suggesting
in
connectin
with
that
is
that
the
purpose
of
comity
principle
is
to
avoid
these
jurisdictional
conflicts
between
state
and
federal
courts.
here
is
an
opportunity
for
the
plaintiffs
who
are
already
in
the
pending
state
court
proceeding
to
say
to
the
state
court
here
is
our
claim
and
will
you
pass
upon
it
and
if
the
state
court
says
yes
we
will,
there
is
nothing
to
this
case.
mr.
philip
baskin
no,
your
honor
there
is
no
question
of
irreparable
damages
here
because
we
have
admitted
that
they
are
entitled
to
damages
if
there
is
a
taking
and
no
matter
how
long
the
trial
may
proceed
--
mr.
philip
baskin
you
mean
in
the
preceding
case?
mr.
philip
baskin
oh
no,
no
sir
i
don't
--
mr.
philip
baskin
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
baskin
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
i
might
point
out
that
they
cannot
be
hurt
by
delay
in
this
case,
because
if
they
are
entitled
the
damages
for
a
taking
then
they
are
entitled
to
what
we
call
the
pension
money
which
was
in
effect
interest
on
the
award.
mr.
philip
baskin
well
i
should
that
what
attorney
alpern
said
about
them
i
could
very
charitable
he
say
about
them
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
baskin
no,
but
there
are
very,
there
are
some
very
obscure
questions
concerning
procedure.
now
i
might
say
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
i'll
use
your
language.
mr.
philip
baskin
your
language
at
best
it's
a
forecast
rather
than
a
determination
of
what
the
state
supreme
court
would
say.
however,
i
want
to
point
out
in
fairness
to
the
circuit
court
below
in
our
case
that
the
gardner
case
which
we
refer
to
in
our
brief
and
which
came
down
subsequent
to
their
decision
is
the
first
case
which
really
seem
to
deal
very
squarely
with
a
question
of
the
powers
of
the
board
of
viewers
on
questions
of
law.
in
other
words,
the
gardner
case
said
a
board
viewers
doesn't
just
assess
damages,
that's
what
the
circuit
court
below
said
a
board
of
viewers
could
do.
the
gardner
case
said
that
the
board
of
viewers
determined
all
relevant
questions
of
law
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
that's
what
the
circuit
court
said,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
let's
assume
that
we
don't
know
who
is
right,
the
circuit
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
--
mr.
philip
baskin
all
circuit
court
judges
are
very
good
your
honor.
yeah
what
i
--
mr.
philip
baskin
what
we
are
suggesting
here,
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
no
matter
how
learned
they
are
in
the
law
that
when
it's
a
question
of
state
law
that
only
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
can
adjudicate
at
best
as
a
forecast
rather
than
a
determination.
and
what
we
said
to
the
court
below
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is,
let's
assume
that
we
are
not
correct
about
the
gardner
case,
let's
assume
that
it
doesn't
say
all
that
we
say
it
does,
there
is
no
law
that
says
what
the
circuit
court
says
either,
so
why
not
let
the
state
court
which
now
has
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
and
over
the
subject
matter
have
a
chance
to
entertain
the
question
while
the
parties
are
still
there.
and
we
think
that
that
will
avoid
all
of
these
many
questions
that
are
in
our
brief
about
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
of
whether
2283
applies
or
not.
we
think
it
could
take
that
view
of
the
case,
there
is
no
necessity
for
determining
the
jurisdictional
questions
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
baskin
we
believe
that
there
is,
your
honor.
he
is
there
now,
the
trial
has
not
begun
and
we
believe
that
simply
by
an
amendment
to
his
petition
--
in
other
words
when
he
filed
his
original
petition,
he
claimed
that
it
was
in
effect
a
valid
taking,
he
didn't
question
the
taking,
he
just
asked
for
an
award.
and
now
we
say
he
can
simply
amend
that
petition
by
saying
that
after
discovered
facts
have
made
him
believe
that
the
original
taking
was
invalid
and
that
therefore
there
should
not
be
an
award,
there
should
be
no
award
at
all,
but
an
adjudication
that
there
has
been
no
taking
and
that
could
be
handled
right
in
the
present
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
philip
baskin
well
the
attorney
general
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
proceeding
your
honor.
this
is
a
proceeding
in
a
court
of
common
pleas
by
the
county
of
allegheny
--
mr.
philip
baskin
now
we
control
that
litigation
and
there
is
no
question
in
our
minds
that
we
would
have
no
objection
for
that
proceeding.
mr.
philip
baskin
no
we
certainly
would
not.
mr.
philip
baskin
i
did
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
philip
baskin
i
did
say
the
opposite,
in
other
words
our
contention
is,
if
you
go
through
the
proceeding,
and
do
not
eject
to
propriety
of
the
taking
in
the
first
instance
–-
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
let
me
address
myself
to
two
different
situations
which
might
show
the
difference
in
the
answers,
one
is
they
have
alleged
here
that
at
the
time
the
county
took
the
property
it
had
no
plan
for
a
public
purpose,
in
other
words
they
said
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
now
they
could
have
determined
at
the
time
of
the
taking
what
the
purpose
is.
now
going
through
an
entire
condemnation
proceeding
without
objecting
to
the
taking,
then
getting
an
award
in
damages,
and
then
coming
back
two
years
later
and
saying
we
now
believe
that
at
the
time
of
the
taking,
it
was
an
improper
taking,
i
think
they
would
be
foreclosed
and
the
matter
would
be
res
judicata.
now
there
might
be
a
different
situation
where
if
at
the
time
of
the
taking
there
was
a
public
purpose,
and
then
perhaps
five
years
later,
as
is
done
with
private
railroad
companies,
they
abandon
that
public
purpose,
there
is
a
procedure
whereby
the
original
owner
maybe
able
to
recover
the
land,
but
that's
not
applicable
to
a
taking
for
an
original
public
purpose
with
the
municipal
government
in
pennsylvania,
and
i
say
this,
that
if
at
the
time
of
the
taking
there
was
no
question
raised
about
the
validity
and
it
goes
through
a
proceeding,
that
res
judicata
would
apply.
mr.
philip
baskin
no
sir,
your
honor
in
fact
your
statement
of
the
law
as
to
the
assumptions
on
the
public
purpose
of
the
taking
of
pennsylvania
correctly
states
the
law.
in
pennsylvania
if
the
board
of
commissioners
say
we're
taking
this
for
the
purpose
of
adding
it
to
airport
purposes,
that's
a
public
taking
until
somebody
else
shows
that
it's
not
for
a
public
purpose.
mr.
philip
baskin
well,
i
have
to
go
outside
the
record.
they
are
not
in
the
dark
because
these
things
go
on
for
months.
for
example
the
property
right
now
is
being
used
for
airport
purposes.
this
was
planned
several
years
before
the
resolution.
there
are
maps
on
record.
there
are
discussions
with
the
county
commissioner,
that
--
mr.
philip
baskin
well
let
me
point
out
this
to
your
honor
that
in
the
viewers'
proceeding,
there
is
a
plan
presented,
of
what's
to
be
taken.
now
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
what
they
want
to
take
of
whether
they
are
actually
taking
it
for
airport
purposes,
there
is
the
place
to
raise
it
because
the
meats
and
bounds
are
set
forth
and
the
purpose
is
set
forth.
so
it's
very
easy
for
a
property
owner
to
say,
well
let's
see
if
this
for
an
airport
purpose
or
let's
see
if
it
isn't.
all
that
we're
saying
here
is
there
right
there
in
front
of
that
court,
they
have
admitted
before
the
court
in
effect
that
there
was
a
proper
taking.
all
that
we're
saying
to
them
is
this,
why
don't
you
at
least
go
back
to
that
court
where
you've
admitted
there
a
proper
taking,
say
that
it
wasn't
a
proper
taking
and
let
that
court
decide
its
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
baskin
i
think
mr.
schmidt.
