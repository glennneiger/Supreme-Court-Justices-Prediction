justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
we
can
take
it
from
your
statement.
the
attorney
general
would
not
permit
the
question
like
it
to
be
raised
after
having,
after
having
--
you
having
made
the
statement
here,
objection
to
the
amendment
that
you
should
give.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
question
in
your
mind
but
in
fact
if
you
would
not
raise
any
such
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
purpose,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
was
that
the
only
purpose
and
nothing
else
in
the
record
showed
differently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
constructing
an
airport
there
for
use?
i
thought
that
the
briefs
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
reading
from
the
brief
of
the
other
side,
i
am
wondering
if
we
time
take
that
as
they
cite
pages
on
the
record
that
they
were
to
be
used
for
an
airport
wise
was
going
to
build
it
and
it
was
necessary
to
have
this
place
to
store
his
tools
and
so
forth
in
order
to
build
the
airport.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
about
page
10
page
of
the
record.
assuming
there
was
a
petition
for
appeal
from
the
warden
who
was
a
juror,
in
which
the
company
setup,
that
this
was
to
be
used
by
an
appellee.
how
did
that
get
in
here,
page
10,
exhibit
b,
motion
to
dismiss,
citing
--
where
you
took
an
appeal
from
the
board
of
--
from
the
viewers
to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
wrong
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
people
say
that
this
was
--
the
result
could
be
used
or
acquired
for
the
purpose
of
establishing,
maintaining
their
own
air
navigation
and
terminal
facilities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
show
that
he
had
a
contract
with
the
county
of
allegheny?
your
records
show
that
he
at
that
time
had
a
contract
with
the
county
of
allegheny,
in
connection
with
the
airport
or
construction
of
the
airport?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
in
the
motion
to
dismiss,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
attached
to
their
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
states
at
the
beginning,
exhibit
b,
the
motion
to
dismiss
to
court
of
common
pleas
of
allegheny
county,
pennsylvania.
i
just
don't
quite
understand
it,
the
connection
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
setup
that
it
was
a
--
to
be
used
for
public
airport.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
there
is
an
answer
to
it,
which
was
also
attached.
justice
hugo
l.
black
contract
between
wise
and
the
county
of
allegheny.
