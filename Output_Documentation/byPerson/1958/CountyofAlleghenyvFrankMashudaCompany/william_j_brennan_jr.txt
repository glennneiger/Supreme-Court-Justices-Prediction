they
could
have
raised
it
before
the
board
of
viewers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
the
board
of
viewers
determine
this
particular
question,
whether
this
was
taking
for
a
public
use?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
court
of
common
pleas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
this
question
had
not
been
raised
before
the
viewers,
but
on
the
appeal,
put
it
on
the
appeal
then
be
raised
in
the
trial
de
nevo
in
court
of
common
pleas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so

get
two
cracks
at
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
clear
that
even
if
you
don't
raise
it
before
the
board
of
viewers
you
may
still
have
an
opportunity
to
raise
it
in
the
court
of
common
pleas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

we
hearing

circuit
court
said

the

brennan,
jr.

what
kind
of
people
are
appointed
to
it,
what's
the
background,
