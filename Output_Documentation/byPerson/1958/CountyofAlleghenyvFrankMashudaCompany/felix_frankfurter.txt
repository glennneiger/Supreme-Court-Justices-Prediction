justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
before
you
go
into
the
procedural
detail
as
given,
according
to
it
the
law
as
annunciated
by
the
people
of
pennsylvania,
if
the
county
or
the
state
came
before
–
can
before
the
people
of
pennsylvania
and
said
yes
your
honor
we
want
to
condemn,
we
want
to
condemn
land
solely
to
a
private
purpose
in
the
sense
this
will
advantage
some
private
enterprise
because
they
apparently
think
it
will
add
to
the
economy
of
the
county
or
the
state,
is
the
law
of
your
state
court
is
so
clear
(inaudible)
in
such
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
doctrine
or
the
principle
(inaudible)
the
power
to
condemn
and
declare
by
your
court
is
that
it
must
be
for
public
purpose
so
that
i
suppose
the
controversies
have
been
contemplated
before
your
court
as
well
as
before
this
court
whether
the
purpose
as
arisen
public
in
the
context
of
a
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
determines
the
validity
of
the
claim
that
it
is
for
public
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
deal
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
giving
me
(inaudible)
just
by
way
of
date,
the
date
when
the
state
proceedings
were
initiated,
where
they
were
when
the
federal
proceedings
began?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
public
versus
private
purpose
of
the
taking
an
issue
before
the
viewers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
common
pleas'
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
would
you
say
the
appeal
was
taken
--
or
the
award
it
was
in
1956
and
within
30
days
after
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
march
1956
the
appeal
was
filed
in
the
common
plea
within
30
days,
it
brings
us
to
april.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there
was
pre-trial,
was
there
a
pre-trial
step
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
were
they
motioned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
postponement
of
the
hearing
in
common
pleas
was
not
out
of
deference
or
by
agreement
that
the
federal
proceeding
to
be
initiated
and
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
nobody
raised
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
only
thing
that
is
contested
before
the
viewers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand,
but
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
must
interrupt
you
there
for
asking
whether
you
can
--
whether
pennsylvania
can
foreclose
bringing
the
question,
raising
the
question
in
a
diversity
suit
in
the
federal
court,
although
the
state
law
may
limit
it
to
local
pennsylvania
court,
is
the
question
that
i
should
think
has
been
wholly
clear
in
the
light
of
the
madisonville
case,
but
the
point
here
is,
that
in
fact
it
wasn't
raised
either
before
the
viewers
whether
they
had
been
granted
quasi
judicial
or
not
and
it
was
certainly
not
raised
before
the
common
pleas
which
is
an
indubitable
judicial
tribunal,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
being
endeavor
to
raise
it
by
independent
action,
not
through
removal
of
the
federal
court,
of
the
cause
on
diversity
ground,
but
to
raise
it
by
independent
action
after
the
state
proceedings
in
the
state
courts
had
been
in
process
it
is
perfectly
clear
on
the
fact
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
not
here
because
the
state
proceeding
didn't
go
to
adjudication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
res
judicata
until
you
have
adjudication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
does
this
is
in
your,
is
your
attack
against
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
district
court
resting
on
claims,
this
is
res
judicata
because
if
the
state
proceedings
are
allowed
to
be
completed,
it
would
be
adjudicated
that's
the
ground
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
in
this
case
is
there
any
such
question
as
that
(inaudible)
controversy
in
the
last
case,
namely
the
so
called
irreparable
damages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
claim
that
that
the
state
procedure
is
such
that
undue
delay
will
embarrass
them
in
such
a
way
that
no
damages
can
compensate
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
out
of
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
merely
a
question
whether
the
federal
court
should
entertain
a
diversity
proceeding
brought
a
year
after
the
matter
was
in
submission
or
in
claim
of
decision
by
the
state,
the
common
pleas
court
in
the
state
condemnation
proceeding,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
let
me
ask
you
--
i
meant
to
ask
the
attorney
general,
i
rather
was
thinking
of
asking
the
attorney
general,
in
the
other
case
the
attorney
general
alpern
said
that,
when
asked
about
these
pennsylvania
judges,
he
said
they
get
us
(inaudible)
knowledge
of
pennsylvania
law.
here
we
have
got
again
out
of
three,
two,
pennsylvania
judges
if
it's
not
truly
relevant
my
curiosity
is
going
to
be
peak
why
these
pennsylvania
judges
would
want
to
sit
as
pennsylvania
condemnation
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know.
but
that
merely
brings
me
to
the
next
question,
why
should
they
jettison?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
some,
is
there
something
below
the
surface
that
makes
the
condemnation
process
of
pennsylvania
ruthless,
or
severe,
or
difficult,
or
obscure
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
think
they
can
do
it
better
than
the
state
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they're
more
interested
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
fungible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
control
that
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
any
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
controversy
that
whatever
right
you
may
have
in
an
ejectment
proceeding,
you
could
have
asserted
in
the
common
pleas
on
appeal
on
de
novo
review
of
the
board
of
viewers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
in
the
common
pleas
proceeding
if
state
condemnation
efforts
are
frustrated
then
you
have
already
won,
haven't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
common
pleas
says
that
this
is
a
taking
for
private
not
public
purposes,
nobody
can
touch
your
land?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
would
--
what
would
be
the
remedy
in
the
common
pleas
court
if
the
question
of
what
private
versus
public
purpose
is
raisable
in
that
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
the
viewers
–
must
the
viewers
approve
the
taking
under
pennsylvania
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
the
question
of
--
is
the
objection
that
the
taking
is
for
private
purposes
raisable
in
the
federal
--
in
the
state
court
other
than
for
an
ejectment
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
not
raisable
in
the
condemnation
proceeding
itself,
resisting
it
on
the
ground
that
it's
not
for
a
public
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
know
nothing
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
very
important
for
me
to
determine
whether
the
condemnation
sought
by
the
state
maybe
denied
on
the
ground
that
it
is
for
private
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
condemnation
can
be
arrested
by
the
common
pleas
on
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that
follows
necessarily
at
all,
because
you
can
go
to
the
pennsylvania
court,
presumably
you
get
justice
there
and
it
doesn't
follow
because
you
may
go
into
the
federal
court,
but
the
federal
court
must
allow
you
to
go
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
diversity
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
we
have
several
decisions
of
this
court
over
my
dissent
in
some
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
my
mind
has
come
to
rest
on
important
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
the
defendant
in
a
case
where
the
case
is
sent
back
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
dissented
in
a
case
in
which
justice
black
wrote
fro
the
court
in
a
diversity
case
on
the
ground
of
the
federal
court
is
just
as
well
equipped
as
a
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
have
raised
any
other
question
except
damages
for
the
common
pleas?
could
you
have
raised
any
other
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
i
just
wanted
to
know
whether
you
--
whether
the
issue
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
view
of
the
viewers
is
clearly,
whether
it's
52,000
or
83,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
that
there
is
nothing
to
try
from
your
point
of
view
if
all
that's
admitted
there
is
nothing
to
try.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
maybe
a
contest
on
the
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
starting
point
is,
the
sovereign
position
by
pennsylvania
that
the
county
has
alligated
that
he
wants
to
condemn
this
and
every
(inaudible)
position
is
the
basis
of
condemnation
is
a
lawful
constitutional
basis,
isn't
it?
state
doesn't
have
to,
if
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
county
of
allegheny
or
city
of
new
york
wants
to
condemn
nobody
is
going
to,
they
don't
affirmatively
prove
they
need
it
for
a
public
purpose
unless
a
claim
is
made
of
the
negative
order
and
that's
the
claim
you
are
making,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
jury
going
from
the
federal
court,
what
jury
i
mean
you
are
going
to
get?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
pennsylvania
folk
aren't
they,
not
wisconsin
folks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest,
i
suggest
that
since
you
invoked
hamilton
he
merely
explained,
he
gave
a
reason
for
that,
he
wasn't
asked
for
this,
neither
was
madison
neither
were
any
of
the
plaintiffs,
very
hot
with
the
federal
--
for
the
diversity
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
need
to
say
that
trial
lawyers
like,
they
don't
think
that,
i
know
they
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
certainly
isn't
if
you
are
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no,
if
you
are
right,
and
there
is
certainly
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
eminent
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
do
you
think
is
the
policy
that
takes
away
jurisdiction
from
the
federal
court
and
enjoins
a
state
proceeding
that's
underway,
what
do
you
think
the
policy
is
in
light
of
your
feeling
that
allegheny
judges
and
juries
can't
do
justice
to
wisconsin
claimants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
you
didn't
say
couldn't
do
justice,
that
they'd
be
would
be
partial
to
allegheny.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
you
felt
strongly
as
lawyers
do
feel
strongly,
that
an
outsider
can't
get
a
fair
deal,
or
rather
that
local
judges
and
jurors
are
prejudiced
against
an
outsider,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
what
else
you
meant
to
convey
as
a
matter
of
fact.
you
even
suggested
that
you
drive
us
to
disqualify
allegheny
citizens
from
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
bias
isn't
it
i
know
on
the
grounds
that
you
disqualify
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
interest.
you
think
(inaudible)
pittsburgh
cares
a
lot
who
gets
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
you
think
the
policy
is
behind
such
a
restriction
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
think
the
policy
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
2283
isn't
restricted
to
questions
of
constitutional
problems
at
all.
2283
applies
to
a
great
diversity
of
cases,
and
has
applied
for
150
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends
a
lot
on
how
you
feel
about
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
res
judicata,
i
beg
your
pardon
–
apart
from
res
judicata
does
the
resolution
set
forth
or
does
it
have
set
forth
in
particularity
the
purpose
of
the
taking?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
is
that
push
in
the
corner
determination?
i
mean
when
you
say
we
take
it
for
odd
purposes,
is
everybody
in
the
dark
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
may
all
be
a
guise
to
do
a
favor,
to
some
political
henchmen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
was
counsel
for
the
mashuda
company
before
the
common
plea?
