mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
assure
your
honors
that
we
rely
very
heavily
upon
the
judicial
expertise
of
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
i
think
as
the
last
two
arguments
have
demonstrated
to
your
honors
the
degree
of
sanctity
which
counsel
gives
to
the
expertise
of
any
particular
court
depends
upon
which
side
of
the
argument
you
are
on.
i
believe
however
in
this
particular
case,
demonstrably
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
was
correct.
there
is
here
no
difficult
or
undecided
question
of
pennsylvania
law.
i
don't
mean
to
in
anyway
derogate
from
the
judicial
experience
of
judges
goodrich,
staley,
and
mclaughlin
who
decided
the
case
below
and
i
don't
think
i
am
doing
so
when
i
say
that
these
matters
are
so
well
decided,
these
are
really
matters
of
what
you
would
consider
the
lowest
echelon
of
procedural
problems
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
that
is
fundamental
of
work
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
standard
pennsylvania
practice
makes
it
very
clear
that
a
pennsylvania
citizen
in
this
set
of
circumstances
which
we
have
before
us
and
i
would
like
to
allude
briefly
in
a
moment
to
the
facts
would
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action,
an
ejectment
which
we
in
effect
have
brought
in
the
federal
court
despite
the
ablation
of
the
forms
of
action
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
an
action
of
ejectment?
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
very
clearly
we
have
a
right
under
the
unquestioned
pennsylvania
law
to
do
that,
now
we
feel
that
in
as
much
as
we
are
representing
wisconsin
residents,
wisconsin
citizens
who
own
land
in
pennsylvania
which
was
as
we
contend
tortiously
taken
from
them,
they
have
a
right
to
bring
it
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
and
i
would
like
to
advert
very
briefly
and
i
am
not
going
to
read
from
this
book
but
merely
make
reference
to
it
that
since
our
brief
was
printed
and
filed
in
this
court
on
march
the
13th,
there
arrived
in
our
office
another
volume
of
what
i
believe
will
be
a
standard
work
on
pennsylvania
practice
procedure
and
legal
question
called
pennsylvania
law
encyclopedia
volume
13
eminent
domain
sections
131,
2
and
3,
which
again
very
clearly
in
a
court
with
standard
pennsylvania
practice
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
make
it
clear
that
a
pennsylvania
resident
in
these
circumstances
would
have
the
right
to
bring
ejectment
to
get
his
property
back.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
believe
it
is
the
position
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
would
not
want
to
put
words
in
the
mouth
of
counsel
for
the
county,
but
i
would
certainly
disagree
with
any
contention
that
we
can
engraft
an
ejectment
proceeding
against
martin
wise,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case,
into
a
condemnation
proceeding
between
the
county
of
allegheny
and
the
mashudas
as
to
how
much
money
the
mashudas
will
get
for
the
land
which
was
taken
from
them.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
no
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
we
want
a
remedy,
we
want
a
writ,
that
a
sheriff
or
a
marshall
can
execute
by
return
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
they
have
taken
it
already
your
honor
and
they
are
on
it.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
they
are
there,
we
want
them
out.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
don't
mean
by
inadvertence
to
agree
with
your
basic
proposition
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
caveating
that
proposition,
if
we
can
get
in
before
they
take
it,
we
have
a
remedy
of
bill
in,
bill
in
equity
to
stop
it,
the
spann
case
and
many
other
cases
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
make
that
perfectly
plain.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
under
pennsylvania
law
the
viewers'
proceedings
are
much
different
than
i
believe
viewers'
proceedings
in
any
other
jurisdiction
of
which
i
have
knowledge.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
it's
raised
bill
in
equity,
action
and
ejectment
or
trespass
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
submit
that
it
is
not,
but
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
necessary
for
our
success
in
this
case
to
establish
that
proposition
because
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
oh!
yes
there
is
no
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
mr.
justice
frankfurter
there
is
no
dispute
by
anybody,
the
property
may
not
be
taken
for
a
private
purpose
by
the
commonwealth
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
disagree
with
that,
but
i
â€“-
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
but
i
believe
--
well
may
i
explain
my
answer
just
a
little
bit.
in
order
to
prevail
in
this
case
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
the
county
has
to
do
more
than
show
that
it
could
be
raised
in
the
viewers'
proceedings,
i
believe
the
county
has
to
establish
the
proposition
to
the
satisfaction
of
this
court
which
had
failed
to
do
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
it
failed
properly,
that
not
only
can
it
be
but
that
it
must
be.
so
that
the
appeal
of
the
viewers'
proceedings
and
the
appeal
therefrom
are
the
exclusive
remedy
because
if
they
are
not,
if
it
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy
then
a
pennsylvania
citizen
has
the
opportunity
to
bring
ejectment
despite
the
pendency
of
viewers'
proceedings
and
if
a
pennsylvania
citizen
has
the
right
to
bring
an
independent
proceeding
and
ejectment,
trespass
or
bill
in
equity
which
is
quite
clear
under
the
pennsylvania
decisions
then
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
and
cases
such
as
farmer's
loan
&
trust
against
regan
a
non-pennsylvania
citizen
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
in
a
diversity
case?
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i,
if
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
but,
your
honor
dissented
in
the
stoody
case
which
reached
exactly
the
opposite
conclusion
and
i
believe
joined
mr.
justice
black
in
the
conclusion
there
that
because
all
of
all
of
the
other
requisites
for
diversity
jurisdiction
were
present
and
it
was
and
there
were
no
reasons
whatsoever
to
delay
the
disposition
of
the
matter
in
the
federal
court
that
the
diversity
jurisdiction
should
have
applied.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
your
honor
said
that
basically
it
was
not
proper
to
indulge
in
this
type
of,
i
would
believe,
your
honor
corpus
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
if
i
may
be
of
assistance
i
would
like
to
argue
that
point
just
a
little
further?
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
did
not
hear
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
think
--
well,
my
own
feeling
would
be
about
that
area
of
the
law,
that
in
all
of
the
cases
where
your
honors
have
indicated
that
the
matter
is
to
be
sent
to
the
state
court,
that
there
has
been
something
other
than
a
straight
lawsuit
based
on
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
it
engrafts
on
it
as
an
alternative
request,
something
more
than
would
be
asked
for
in
an
ordinary
action
of
law,
but
may
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
this,
that
section
2283
of
the
judicial
code
which
we
contend
is
not
applicable
here,
because
this
is
an
action
at
law
within
its
own
framework,
provides
for
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
and
we
believe
that
by
the
filing
of
an
action
of
the
ejectment,
the
district
court
will
have
obtained
and
i
believe
properly
has
obtained
jurisdiction
over
this
particular
piece
of
land,
and
i
wound
not
want
to
suggest
that,
that
court
under
certain
circumstances
which
might
come
up,
if
the
facts
of
this
case
are
ever
permitted
to
be
proved
in
the
district
court,
might
want
to
issue
an
injunction
in
order
to
protect
its
jurisdiction
within
the
framework
of
section
2283.
we
are
not
now
asking
for
any
equitable
relief.
what
we
want,
is
to
get
our
land
back
and
may
i
on
the
premise
that
sometimes
a
page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
of
logic,
re-advert
very
briefly
to
something
i
should
have
said
probably
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
discussion,
which
is
a
little
fuller
explanation
of
the
chronology
of
this
case,
because
i
don't
believe
that
county's
counsel
intended
to
gloss
over
any
facts,
but
there
are
facts
that
are
of
the
record
here,
that
i
believe
are
controlling
which
were
not
mentioned
and
i
think
the
chronology
is
important.
on
june
the
16th
1955
the
county
commissioners
passed
a
resolution
which
was
found
on
its
face,
perfectly
regular
and
in
accordance
with
the
county
law,
the
second
class
county
code,
purporting
to
condemn
these
eight
acres
for
airport
purposes,
under
pennsylvania
law,
that
was
the
condemnation
if
the
court
please.
we've
cited
cases
to
prove
that.
that
was
it.
after
that
all
we
had
was
a
right
to
damages.
now
the
county
then,
under
pennsylvania
law
that
right
can
be
barred
by
a
statute
of
limitations
and
frequently
is,
so
that
the
condemnation
is
valid
even
though
the
right
to
compensation
is
gone.
but
the
county
acting
promptly
in
september
of
1955
or
approximately
three
months
after
the
taking,
petitioned
the
court
of
common
pleas
for
a
board
of
view
asking
for
determination
of
how
much
damages
will
have
to
paid
for
this
property.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
no,
not
to
my
knowledge,
and
its
not
filed,
if
--
what
happens
in
a
case
of
that
kind
is
that
you
appear,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
board
of
viewers
by
statute
in
pennsylvania
is
not
even
required
to
take
testimony,
they
can
go
out
on
the
land
and
make
their
own
determination
of
the
value,
it's
only
more
or
less
as
a
matter
of
custom
and
courtesy
that
the
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
generally
speaking,
yes,
although
as
attorney
general
albern
pointed
out,
our
common
pleas
court
has
two
or
three
boards
of
views,
they
sit
in
groups
of
threes
and
cases
are
customarily
assigned
to
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
yeah
they
purport
to
be.
well
i
don't
mean
to
say
anything
even
inadvertently
in
criticism
of
them,
many
of
them
being
friends
of
mine,
but
certainly
over
the
years
by
getting
into
this
type
of
question
they
develop
an
expertness
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
sometimes
lawyers,
sometimes
from
a
background
that
i
would
have
to
disclaim
personal
knowledge
of
your
honor
without
really
knowing
in
the
case
in
which
this
was
heard,
the
chairman
of
the
board
was
a
--
was
and
is
a
lawyer,
a
member
the
alleghany
county
bar.
now
that
was
the
situation
in
september
of
1955,
and
thereafter
we
had
a
hearing,
and
it
was
determined
that
we
were
entitled
to
52,000
odd
dollars
and
the
mashudas
were
and
both
parties
were
dissatisfied
with
the
amount
of
compensation.
i
might
say
that
as
the
statute
points
out,
the
statute
contemplates
only
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
damages.
it
presupposes
a
taking
and
speaks
of
the
amount
of
compensation
if
the
parties
can't
agree
and
both
sides
appeal
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
raising
only
the
question
of
damages,
no
question
about
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
in
my
view,
not
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
but
in
my
view
even
if
we
could
have,
we
were
not
required
to
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that
in
my
opinion
your
honor
is
the
only
question
before
the
common
pleas,
the
only
case
that
we
were
able
to
find
in
the
federal
courts
that
passed
on
that
question
at
least
rising
out
of
pennsylvania,
because
our
law
and
procedure
is
different.
in
most
states,
federal
condemnation
is
different.
there
is
an
award
made
of
the
land,
the
determination
of
the
proprietary
taken.
similarly
in
many
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
county,
the
same
law
of
taxes
missouri
and
other
states,
the
saw
way,
not
so
in
pennsylvania.
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
in
the
colgate
case
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
page
--
well
several
different
places;
19,
20,
24
and
33
make
it
plain
that
under
pennsylvania
law
and
procedure
the
trial
before
the
board
of
the
view
and
thereafter
is
really
simply
a
famed
issue
to
determine
the
question
of
damages.
now
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
agreed
with
that,
although
i
would
say
again
that
i
believe
that
even
if
this
court
should
disagree
with
me
and
with
the
third
circuit
which
i
earnestly
hope
that
it
will
not;
that,
that
does
not
bar
us
from
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
now
let
us
assume,
however,
that
--
just
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
and
without
making
any
concession
based
thereon
that
we
did
something
wrong
by
not
raising
the
question
up
to
that
time,
the
appeal
was
taken.
then
according
to
our
allegations
and
i
believe
that
the
allegations
contained
in
the
complaint
which
you
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
are
that,
and
i'm
reading
from
paragraph
eight
of
the
complaint
on
page
4
of
the
record,
that
county
prior
to
the
taking
had
not
formulated
any
definite
plan
for
the
use
of
the
land
and
that
it's
only
plan
was
to
lease
it
to
martin
wise,
a
pennsylvania
corporation
for
its
own
private
purposes.
then
we
allege
that
thereafter,
on
or
about
may
22,
1956;
and
as
i
indicated
before
i
believe
that
the
sequence
of
events
is
important,
because
may
22,
1956
is
after
the
appeal
was
taken,
some
new
acts
took
place.
not
only
was
the
taking
invalid
and
void
in
the
first
instance,
but
even
if
it
had
been
valid
or
have
some
type
of
color
of
validity,
then
on
may
22,
1956,
the
property
is
turned
over
to
the
other
defendant
on
this
record
martin
w.
wise
incorporated,
a
business
cooperation.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
we
say
that
the
--
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
black,
that
in
this
record
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
must
be
taken
as
true
because
there
was
never
a
trial,
that
it
was
leased
to
the
defended
martin
w.
wise
incorporated
for
the
benefit
of
said
lessee
and
for
no
public
use.
now
we
say
that
by
the
terms
of
the
lease
to
martin
wise
incorporated,
a
county
surrendered
control
and
possession
of
the
land
to
its
lessee,
and
has
allowed
and
does
allow
and
will
continue
to
allow
an
improper
and
unlawful
private
use
to
be
made
of
the
land
and
then
in
paragraph
11
we
say,
the
plaintiffs
specifically
are
informed
and
believe
that
the
defendant
martin
w.
wise
inc.,
as
lessee
had
used
and
is
using,
all
or
part
of
the
purportedly
condemned
land
as
a
base
for
its
operations
as
a
general
contractor,
few
if
any
of
which
operations
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
for
the
establishment
or
maintenance
of
air
navigation
or
terminal
facilities.
now
those
are
the
allegations.
now
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
correct,
your
honor,
correct
sir,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
in
anyway
negates
this
because
at
least
before
this
court
the
county
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now
if
i
may
remind
the
court
of
the
fact
that
has
not
been
dwelled
upon
extensively
here,
this
suit
was
filed,
this
action
in
ejectment
of
law,
if
the
court
please,
against
a
county
and
its
lessee
martin
w.
wise,
incorporated
which
was
possession
at
the
time
and
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
is
still
in
possession.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well,
the
county,
the
resolution
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners,
if
the
court
please,
stated
that
it
was
going
to
be
used
for
that
purpose
but
as
far
as
i
don't
want
to
go
outside
the
record
on
the
basis
of
my
own
personal
knowledge,
but
according
to
the
record,
according
to
the
record
not
that
i
am
afraid
to
answer
the
question,
i'll
be
glad
to
answer
if
i
am
not
trespassing
on
the
proprieties,
but
the
matter
first
came
to
our
attention
when
martin
w.
wise
appeared
in
possession
and
according
to
the
compliant
and
i
think
the
fair
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
complaint
which
is
admitted
here
is
that
it
was
not
known
prior
to
and
could
not
be
known
prior
to
may
22nd,
1956
that
its
going
to
be
used
for
anything
other
than
the
construction
of
an
airport.
now
we
allege
that
it
was
being
by
martin
w.
wise
generally
and
let
me
dwell
this
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
mr.
justice
black
you
are
exactly
100%
right,
that's
what
they
say
and
that's
point
is
up
for
a
reason
if
i
may
say
so,
why
we
are
entitled
to
try
this
case
in
the
district
court.
that's
taken
from
the
answer
of
martin
wise
and
if
that's
right
then
maybe
we
are
wrong
on
the
facts,
but
the
question
is
where
are
we
going
to
try
this
case.
when
you
get
right
down
to
the
fundamental
reason
of
why
we
are
here
is
we
want
to
get
back
pittsburg
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
and
prove
the
facts
that
we
allege
now
that
i
submit
to
your
honors
are
taken
as
admitted.
and
taken
as
admitted
they
make
this
purported
condemnation
as
invalid
and
as
tortuous
and
as
completely
void
as
if
the
county
commissioners
had
sent
the
sheriff
on
a
passing
out
with
guns
and
drove
the
owners
off
and
turned
it
over
to
the
lessee
martin
wise.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
it's
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
on
the
--
since
the
case
was
thrown
out
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
your
honor
but
we
want
the
right
to
prove
those,
those
facts.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
oh!
yes
and
only
on
the
facts.
if
the
court
please
there
is
no
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that
is
the
claim
we
are
making
your
honor.
i
disagree
with
your
honors
of
the
law
as
it
applies
in
many
jurisdictions.
in
my
research
and
preparation
for
this
case,
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
many
of
the
states
and
particularly
those
involved
in
some
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
county's
brief
here,
that
the
reverse
is
quite
true
that
the
--
that
the
commission
in
many
cases,
a
railroad
commission
or
something
of
that
kind
must
in
the
first
instance
make
a
determination
even
though
it
is
not
questioned
a
determination
that
taking
is
for
a
proper
public
purpose,
not
so
in
pennsylvania.
what
the
law
is
in
new
york
i
am
not
qualified
to
say,
because
i
haven't
looked
at
it.
but
in
this
particular
case
we
submit,
we
submit
if
your
honor
please
that
in
a
suggestion
by
mr.
justice
whitaker
in
the
earlier
argument
that
legally
speaking
this
taking
which
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
only
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
the
trail
on
the
merit,
on
the
facts
submitted
for
this
argument
was
as
tortuous
as
if
the
sheriff
had
gone
out
with
a
gun.
and
the
fact
that
they've
enforced
these
people
off
and
the
fact
that
they
choose
to
camouflage
it
as
an
eminent
domain
taking,
does
not
vary,
the
legal
result
from
the
standpoint
of
diversity
of
citizenship,
and
the
right
to
proceed
in
diversity
case
at
law
in
the
federal
courts.
now
there
is
a
practical
reason
why
we
want
to
be
in
the
federal
court
and
i
don't
think
we
should
overlook
it
and
it
doesn't
sound
very,
perhaps
very
philosophical
from
those
standpoint
of
jurisprudence,
but
i
think
it
is
exactly
the
kind
of
practical
consideration
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind
and
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
first
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction
statutes
when
they
did
those
things
and
that
is
this.
i
think
myself
that
all
judges
try
to
do
a
good
job.
most
jurors
i
believe
at
least
think
they
are
trying
to
do
a
good
job.
it's
an
issue
that's
not
before
us,
but
we
are
against
the
county
of
allegheny,
we
are
from
wisconsin.
we
try
this
case
in
ejectment
of
an
appeal
from
the
board
of
view,
its
going
to
be
before
a
jury
composed
of
whom,
citizens
drawn
exclusively
from
allegheny
county
and
its
going
to
be
tried
before
a
judge
elected
by
the
citizen
of
allegheny
county.
now
i
think
when
alexander
hamilton
in
the
federalist
papers
number
80
said
that
in
a
diversity
case
a
person
from
outside
the
state
has
a
right
to
go
into
a
tribunal
which
does
not
owe
any
allegiance
to
local
institutions
in
order
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
bias.
i
think
he
was
thinking
about
just
the
type
of
a
case
that
we
have
here
and
i
don't
suggest
that
any
common
pleas
judge
in
allegheny
county
is
going
to
be
biased,
but
i
think
we
are
all
sufficiently
realistic
to
know
that
local
people
do
have
let
us
say
perhaps
a
special
sensitivity
to
local,
to
local
desires
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
classic
case
for
the
exercise
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
we
are
going
to
have
to
prove
facts,
that
pennsylvania
law
is
settled.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
jurymen
are
drawn
in
western
districts,
from
all
over
the
western
district.
however
that
raises
a
question
that
i
have
in
mind
if
we
ever
get
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that's
correct
but
that's
the
best
we
can
do
with
the
diversity
citizenship
with
the
diversity
rule
as
it
is.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor
i
was
looking
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
a
trial
lawyer
who
is
used
to
operating
down
on
that
level
i
must
say
that
it
weighs
rather
heavily
in
my
determination
in
any
particular
case
as
to
which
jurisdiction
i
invoke
in
this
case
was
one
of
the
reason
why
i
chose
on
behalf
of
mashudas
to
attempt
to
get
the
case
into
the
federal
court.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
on
the
record
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
was
going
to
say
was
this
the,
i
think
i
am
perhaps
jumping
the
gun
just
a
bit
but
the
next
question
i
had
in
my
mind
if
we
ever
do
due
get
back
and
get
a
chance
to
prove
these
facts
was
whether
or
not
i'd
be
able
to
challenge
any
allegheny
county
resident
for
cause
that's
another
question.
but
the,
the
next
what
i'd
like
to
say
is
this
if
i
may
in
the
time,
least
time
remaining
in
hand,
of
course
since
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
a
jury's
verdict
will
have
all
the
sanctity
of
a
jury
verdict
and
its
not
going
to
be
reviewed
by
any
appellate
court
not
along
this
one.
now
we
have
answered
in
our
brief
that
particular
arguments
of
the
county
as
to
why
this
case
should
not
be
in
the
diversity
one
according
to
us
obviously
it
is.
we
don't
think
2283
applies,
it's
not
a
equity
case,
a
relief
or
the
request
for
an
injunction
was
merely
in
the
alternative.
we
don't
think
this
is
an
in
rem
action
we
have
explained
why.
there
is
no
question
of
comity
or
interference
because
there
is
no
difficult
question
of
state
law
or
interpretation
of
a
state
statute
upon
which
will
depend
a
constitutional
issue
here,
there
is
a
no
constitutional
issue
here.
the
only
question
here
is
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
only
in
the
diversity
sense
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
the
state
admits,
the
state
admits
that
if
our
facts
are
true
the
exercise
is
invalid
and
i
might
say
this.
i
don't
know
where
martin
wise
stands
on
this
record,
they
don't
appear
to
be
here
although
the
record
was
reversed
as
to
them
below
and
i'd
say
again
what
i
want
is
an
opportunity
to
prove
for
the
mashudas
in
the
district
court
the
facts
that
we
have
alleged
which
was
taken
as
true
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
now
we
would
like
the
opportunity
to
prove
it
in
that
court
because
we
think
it's
a
classical
case
on
the
facts
and
on
the
practicalities
for
determination
in
a
federal
court
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
urge
your
honors
to
do
what
the
court
had
done
in
other
cases
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
to
rely
on
the
judicial
experience
and
expertness
of
the
three
judges,
two
of
whom
were
pennsylvania
lawyers,
have
decided
that.
i
think
their
decision
was
correct.
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
clogs
the
issue
is
that
fact
that
the
county
disappointed
at
the
result,
now
attempts
to
say
that
it's
a
difficult
question
or
that
the
state,
that
the
court
of
appeals
judges
jettisoned
the
state
law,
i
don't
think
court
of
appeal
judges
do
that,
i
think
they
recognized
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
it
was
an
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
case
your
honor
and
i
would
assume
it
would
be,
because
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
is
completely
within
pennsylvania
and
i
don't
know
of
any
federal
judge,
district
judge
that
is
appointed
from
a
state
other
than
that,
in
which
the
district
is
located.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
in
the
colgate
case?
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
oh
i
would
--
allow
me
to
retract
what
i
said,
i
thought
it
was
a
decision
by
a
single
judge,
if
it's
a
three
judge
court,
it's
conceivable
he
could
have
been
brought
in
from
other
district,
although
i
don't
think
that's
very
customary.
so
please
excuse
my
inadvertence,
i
thought
there
was
only
one
judge,
i
don't
know
whether
he
is
from
pennsylvania
or
not.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that
went
in
because
the
county
simply
appended
it
as
an
exhibit
to
their
motion
to
dismiss
and
have
--
it
was
filed
in
the
district
court
and
ever
since
that
time
it's
been
printed
as
a
part
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
oh
no
it's
perfectly
accurate
your
honor,
although
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
the
only
thing
that's
wrong
with
it
is
your
honor
that
it
wasn't
until
approximately
a
month
later
that
we
found
out
that
it
was
leased
to
martin
wise
which
the
record
also
shows
uncontradictedly
occurred
on
or
about
may
22,
1956,
approximately
one
month
after
the
(inaudible)
was
taken,
the
affidavit
was
sponsored
by
mr.
mashuda
to
this
appeal.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
we
would
object
strenuously
to
any
incorporation
of
that
fact
in
the
record,
we
did
not
allege
it.
for
the
purpose
of
the
record
it
is
--
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
it
is
not
here,
that
is
purely
a
defensive
statement
which
would
have
to
be
brought
out
on
the
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
no
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
no
sir,
i
beg
to
differ
with
you,
that
is
in
the
--
is
an
appendix
or
an
exhibit
to
the
answer
on
the
merits
filed
by
the
defendant
martin
w.
wise
incorporated,
who
did
not
file
a
motion
to
dismiss.
that
is
appended
to
the
answer
on
the
merits
of
that
defendant.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
exhibit
b,
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
the
petition
for
appeal
from
the
award
of
the
board
of
viewers.
that's
a
paper
that
i
filed
on
behalf
of
the
mashudas,
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that's
right,
that's
what
we
thought,
that
what
the
resolution
said,
and
it
appeared
to
be
fair
on
its
face.
what
your
honor
is
referring
to
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that's
attached,
if
your
honor
will
look
mr.
justice
black
to
page
14
of
that
record,
your
honor
will
see
that
page
14
is
not
a
portion
of
the
motion
to
dismiss,
but
is
the
answer
of
martin
w.
wise
incorporated,
the
other
defendant,
who
is
not
a
party
to
the
eminent
domain
proceedings
at
all.
that
answer
on
the
merits
was
filed
and
what
you're
referring
to
if
the
court
please
as
exhibit
a,
on
page
19
is
an
attachment
to
that
answer.
it
is
not
i
submit
a
part
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
yes
and
i
would
be
willing
to
abandon
it
in
the
record
here
too
if
it
simplifies
the
matter,
because
i
feel
as
the
court
did
that
it
was
mere
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
we
put
it
in
as
an
excess
of
caution
as
trial
people
do,
so
as
to
try
to
cover
everything,
but
this
is
really
an
action
of
ejectment
against
one
part
at
least
which
is
not
even
a
party
to
the
record
in
the
eminent
domain
proceedings.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
your
honor
says
it
makes
very
little
difference?
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
that
an
injunction
against
the
procedure
in
the
state
is
what
section
2283
had
in
mind.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
an
ejectment
action
only
interferes
on
the
basis
that
any
res
judicata
situation
will
interfere
with
the
decision
of
a
similar
issue
by
another
court,
but
the
issue
is
not
even
similar.
so
we
contend,
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully,
that
there
is
quite
a
difference.
the
action
and
ejectment
raises
an
entirely
different
question,
and
is
completely
different
than
bill
in
equity
for
an
injunction,
which
might
be
--
probably
would
be
within
the
purview
of
section
22
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
--
perhaps
your
honor
is
reading
more
into
what
i
said
than
what
i
actually
meant.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
far,
because
the
probabilities
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
yes
i
will
have
to
say
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
interest.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
your
honor
apparently
there
is
a
great
deal
interest
in
it
or
we
wouldn't
be
here,
but
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
what
is
the
policy,
i
don't
know,
but
i
disagree
that
it
affects
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
do
anymore
than
issue
that
particular
type
of
relief.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
i
think
this
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
--
this
would
be
the
policy
if
i
may
say
so
briefly.
in
a
case
which
is
other
than
a
diversity
law
case,
and
where
there
is
some
very
good
reason
for
subscribing,
for
circumscribing
the
diversity
jurisdiction
or
otherwise,
federal
jurisdiction,
federal
question
jurisdiction,
then
the
policy
of
non-interference
with
the
state
might
outweigh
the
basic
constitutional
considerations
giving
to
the
federal
court
the
right
to
try
cases
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
i
say
here
that
consistent
with
that
policy
we
have
the
classic
case
for
diversity
jurisdiction,
at
law
the
absence
of
any
of
the
countervailing
considerations
such
as
avoidance
of
constitutional
questions,
direct
interference
with
state
operations,
because
this
eminent
domain
proceeding
can
go
on.
it
can
go
on,
they've
got
the
land,
we're
not
holding
them
up.
it's
not
like
the
airport
case,
they
are
there,
we
are
not,
we
are
not
holding
anybody
up
and
that
there
is
no
reason
why
we
can't
go
ahead
and
try
this
case
anymore
than
you
do
in
dozens
of
cases,
where
a
plaintiff
files
against
the
defendant
in
one
court,
defendant
files
against
the
plaintiff
in
the
other
court,
and
the
both
proceed
merrily
on
their
way,
until
one
of
them
is
decided,
if
one
of
them
isn't
removed
and
consolidated
with
the
other
case.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
in
a
limited
area
where
the
congress
has
felt
that
the
policy
was
such
that
the
constitutional
diversity
idea
should
be
circumscribed
or
that
the
--
or
the
other
provision
that
gives
the
government
the
right
--
or
a
citizen
a
right
to
go
in
and
have
a
federal
question
litigated
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
it's
a
practical
political
question,
i
think
is
what
it
is
and
congress
has
seen
fit
to
cut
that
little
bit
out
of
the
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor
there
would
be
--
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
well
i
don't
think
he
has
spoken
to
that
point,
but
i
believe
that
the
pennsylvania
court
is
quite
clear
on
it.
if
we
had
waited,
gone
through
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
and
had
it
all
buttoned
up,
gotten
our
money,
and
a
year
later
all
this
happened,
we
certainly
could
have
gone
in
with
an
action
of
ejectment
tendered
the
money
back,
and
i
can't
see
why
we
should
have
to
do
all
of
that
or
wait
when
we
cut
it
in
the
middle
of
the
whole
thing,
that's
the
impractical
aspect
of
the
county's
argument.
we
cut
it
before
it
went
too
far,
why
should
we
be
in
any
worse
position
that
if
we
hadn't
found
it
out
until
two
years
after
the
whole
thing
was
over.
mr.
harold
r.
schmidt
mr.
chief
justice
i
don't
know
if
got
an
answer
before,
we
have
this
order
in
court,
which
i
suggest
--
