justice

the
same
trial
judge?
justice
john

the
state
--
the
state
does
not
object
as
i
understand
it
to
signature
or
are
considering
newspaper
account
in
circumstances
in
this
case.

this
man
took

did
he
cross-examine
the
witness?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
to
know
whether
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
know
whether
the
evidence
at
the
second
trial
was
substantially
the
same
as
the
other
has
presented
in
the
first
trial
when
there
was
a
hung
jury
and
where
he
had
no
lawyer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
interrupt
you
anymore,
but
i
just
want
to
add
one
question,
the
second
trial
before
the
same
judge
has
tried
the
(inaudible)
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it's
true
in
an
event
isn't
it,
that
the
state
does
not
suggest
that
this
--
this
judgment
that
we're
reviewing,
rests
on
an
independent
state
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
ought
to
be
would
be
a
breakfast
suggestion
from
the
state
i
think,
when
there
isn't
any
such
suggestion
--

page?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
one
thing
to
say
though,
without
taking
you
record
at
the
trial
for
taking
a
look
at
the
trial
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know.
that's
the
issue
--
that's
the
issue
that
we
have
here.
it's
simply
whether
or
not,
the
allegations
here
are
so
frivolous
or
so
inadequate
that
the
state
supreme
court
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
could
say,
â€œno,
we
won't
give
this
man
a
hearing,"
without
looking
at
the
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
john
m.

you
don't
put
in
response
