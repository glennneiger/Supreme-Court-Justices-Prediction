mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
way
the
respondent
sees
this
case,
there
was
basically
only
one
question
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
whether
or
not,
based
on
the
facts
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
petition
--
as
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
erred
by
denying
him
the
relief
he
sought.
under
the
long
array
of
decisions
of
this
court,
in
terms
of
the
failure
of
the
--
the
trial
court
in
florida
to
appoint
counsel
to
represent
this
defendant,
the
rule
is
clear.
there
must
exist,
particular
circumstances
in
a
particular
case
to
reflect
of
that
degree
of
unfairness
that
actively
operated
in
the
process
that
resulted
in
his
confinement.
now,
the
petitioner
early
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
and
the
record
as
counsel
for
petitioner
stated,
this
court
constitutes
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
only
the
matter
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
before.
the
petitioner
alleges
that
he
was
unable
to
adequately
defend
himself
in
the
trial
below.
and
for
that
reason,
it
was
imperative
that
the
lower
court
appoint
counsel.
now
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
they
are
--
they
are
the
questions.
he
says
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
your
honor.
he
--
he
alleges
that
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
yes.
that
--
but
the
--
the
way
we
view
that,
that
would
go
more
to
the
question
of
the
denial
of
his
motion
for
continuance
in
order
to
procure
his
own
counsel.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
as
reflected
in
--
in
the
trial
court,
the
trial
judge
considered
that
he
did
not
need
counsel
and
that
continuance
would
be
an
unwarranted
delay.
i
think
we
will
make
that
clear
when
we
examine
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
yes.
it
--
it's
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
see
what
you
--
you
are
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
you
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
very
true,
your
honor.
however,
could
we
not
imply
to
the
statements
of
the
attorneys
that
we
need
more
time,
based
on
the
fact
that
they
knew
nothing
about
this
case?
that
they
had
no
knowledge,
if
this
man,
if
capable
to
defend
himself,
did
sit
to
a
prior
trial,
based
on
the
same
issues.
and
we
feel
that
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
reflects
that
he
had
a
better
knowledge
of
legal
procedures,
then
he
would
lead
the
--
this
court
now
to
believe
or
the
supreme
court
of
florida
early
in
--
late
in
1957
when
he
filed
this
petition.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
we're
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
we
--
we
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
we
recognize
that,
your
honor.
and
we
also
recognize
that
is
--
this
is
a
very
close
case.
we
presented
that
statement
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
in
line
to
that,
the
three-line
order
issued
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
not
an
exemption
in
this
case.
that
is
the
normal
procedure.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
i
don't
know
roughly,
your
honor.
i
left
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
they
run
into
i'd
say
over
a
period
of
a
year,
a
way
over
the
hundreds,
your
honor.
may
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
an
example,
i
left
tallahassee
on
monday,
my
office
represented
eight
alone
that
morning.
we
have
been
called
upon
to
respond
to
12
on
one
motion
calendar.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may
explain
procedure
to
the
court,
which
seemed
to
be
concerned
about
that,
these
prisoners
or
other
persons
filed
petitions
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
attorney
general's
office
represents
the
respondents,
mr.
culver.
at
that
time,
we
are
notified
that
the
petition
will
be
placed
on
a
motion
calendar
to
be
opposed
by
the
attorney
general's
office,
if
they
care
to
oppose
it,
in
a
10-minute
argument.
our
position
is
if
we
feel
it
justified,
that
even
if
true,
the
facts
as
presented
by
the
petitioner
failed
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case.
failed
to
establish
probable
cause.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
then,
if
they
had
discretion,
either
denies
the
writ
in
a
three-line
order.
and
in
fairness
i
must
admit
there
are
occasions
where
they
issue
an
opinion.
where
the
prisoners
obviously,
attempting
to
harass
the
court
by
a
multitude
of
the
petitions,
alleging
the
same
thing.
where
he
filed
a
petition
in
our
court
and
then
come
up
to
this
court
on
certiorari,
have
it
denied
and
start
in
our
state
courts
again.
the
court
will
issue
the
written
order
in
that
case
admonishing
the
prisoner.
however,
if
the
normal
procedure
is
to
issue
just
as
three
or
four
line
order,
considering
it
and
denying
it,
if
that
be
their
--
their
will.
and
in
this
case,
we
explained
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
as
we
explained
to
this
court,
that
what
happened
on
the
morning
of
february
21st
when
this
petitioner
was
presented
to
the
trial
court.
the
first
thing
he
asks
not,
where
is
my
lawyer
or
what
happened?
but
he
wants
to
know
if
his
lawyer
made
a
formal
withdrawal.
filed
a
motion
and
then
the
court
grants
his
motion.
there,
we
say,
there's
an
indication
of
some
experience
in
trial
procedures.
two,
excuse
me,
the
record
shows
clearly
that
he
did
object.
he
knew
he
had
a
right
to
object.
he
was
not
prevented
from
objecting
and
we
admit
that
he
could
not
handle
his
case
probably
in
a
way
a
counsel
long
experience
before
the
criminal
bar
could.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
sure.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
your
honor.
but
we
have
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
these
allegations
as
this,
your
honor.
he
says
here
as
he
walked
--
the
first
thing
he
did
on
the
morning
he
walked
into
court.
he
asked
the
court
whether
mr.
carr,
referring
to
his
earlier
counsel
--
and
this
is
on
page
2
of
the
record,
your
honor.
the
numbers
in
the
upper
left
hand
corner
of
the
pages.
there
are
some
on
the
bottom
--
had
withdrawn
and
asked
the
court
if
mr.
carr
had
filed
a
motion
to
withdraw
as
his
attorney.
judge
patton,
the
trial
judge,
informed
petitioner
he
had
granted
mr.
carr's
motion
to
withdraw.
we
have
no
idea
why
mr.
carr
withdrew.
the
next
we
find
in
his
argument
and
questions
presented
that
he
did
object
to
evidence.
he
knew
he
had
a
right
to
object
to
such
evidence
and
that
at
no
time
during
the
trial,
was
he
precluded
from
objecting
two,
three,
i
--
i
should
say.
he
had
been
present
in
a
trial
on
the
same
issues
before
the
same
court.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he
was
20
years
old
approximately,
your
honor,
at
this
time.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
can't
go
outside
the
record,
your
honor.
as
far
as
this
record
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
what?
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
he
had
never
been
convicted
of
a
crime
before.
he
had
evidently
committed
crimes
before
in
a
language
of
his
accomplice
in
this
particular
case.
he
had
perpetrated
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes.
that's
the
way,
it
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
your
honor,
the
general
rule
in
florida
is
to
this
effect,
that
prior
acts
and
circumstances
are
admissible
to
prove
intent
or
guilty
knowledge
in
a
particular
crime
charged.
and
when
do
these
acts
or
circumstances
constitute
the
commission
of
other
crimes,
they
are
admissible
on
the
question
of
intent,
guilty
knowledge,
to
show
a
plan,
scheme
or
general
criminal
operation.
now,
an
issue
has
been
joined
here
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
--
whether
testimony
comes
solely
from
the
accomplice
witness
connecting
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
with
the
principal
crime
charged,
this
other
crime
testimony
is
admissible.
the
rule
though
is,
however,
that
other
crime
testimony
is
admissible
for
that
specific
purpose
and
of
course
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
--
i
couldn't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
i
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
it
is
a
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that
is
a
--
a
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
your
honor.
may
i
--
there
are
cases
in
florida
involving
--
we
would
say
rape
prosecutions,
where
the
state
has
been
permitted
to
show
whether
has
been
a
question
let's
say
of
identity,
that
this
particular
person
charged
with
this
particular
rape
has
committed
other
rapes
or
other
assaults
with
intent
to
commit
rape
or
other
acts
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
--
in
--
in
--
well,
there
must
be
a
connection
showing
the
same
type
of
criminal
scheme.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that
would
raise
an
illegal
question,
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
your
honor,
of
course,
as
the
court
is
aware,
we
have
no
testimony
in
a
(inaudible)
sense.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
we
have
just
these
statements.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did
not
take
it
necessary
to
order
a
hearing,
which
here,
they
would
normal
--
would
--
could
do,
if
they
thought
the
case
warranted
such.
we
have
just
this
statement,
your
--
on
page
12
of
the
record,
where
petitioner
quotes
from
gainesville
sun
again.
yesterday,
and
this
is
in
the
second
paragraph
of
that
quote
--
or
shall
i
start
from
the
first?
state
attorney
ted
duncan
of
the
prosecutor,
"today
began
the
laborious
process
of
corroborating
testimony
that
ray
cash
participated
in
a
burglary
here
last
year.
yesterday,
lawrence
allen,
a
friend
of
cash
for
over
four
years,
took
the
stand
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
related
how
he
and
cash
in
company
of
two
others,
burglarized
stores,
stole
a
truck
and
become
engaged
in
a
running
gun
battle.
evidently,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
felt
that
this
prior
--
that
--
that
this
testimony
of
other
criminal
activity
was
a
part
of
a
general
plan,
a
general
crime
wave,
perpetrated
or
--
or
exacted
in
the
same
manner.
now
on
this
point,
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
even
if
petitioner's
construction
of
--
of
the
padgett
case,
as
he
quotes
in
his
brief,
and
as
we
quote
in
our
brief,
is
that
where
the
testimony
connecting
the
principal
--
the
--
the
petitioner
with
the
principal
crime
charged,
comes
only
from
the
accomplice,
that
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
connect
him
with
the
crime
for
the
purposes
of
letting
this
other
testimony
or
this
other
evidence
in.
we
have
these
statements
throughout
this
brief
that
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
was
corroborated.
and
so
we
find
that
it
may
be
very
well
not
have
been
inadmissible,
that
it
was
corroborated
and
thus
was
--
not
withstanding
the
padgett
rule,
if
--
even
if
petitioner's
construction
of
the
case
be
proper,
that
it
was
corroborated
and
that
the
petitioner's
case
was
further
connected
with
the
principal
crime
charged
by
evidence
other
than
the
accomplice
testimony.
what
that
corroborative
testimony
we
--
is
we
don't
know.
he
says
it
would
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
--
as
i
present
it
to
this
court
we
recognize
that
this
is
a
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
your
honor.
you
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
just
from
the
statements
made
later
in
his
petition.
they
brought
her
down
the
effect
of
these
strong
allegations
of
uneducated
--
true,
he
may
not
have
had
a
formal
education
and
he
may
have
only
been
20
years
old.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
we
--
because
this
issues
are
true,
we
--
we
cannot
deny
that
into
other
testimony.
but
we
--
as
we
glanced
through
the
petition
and
we
read
his
petition.
we
find
that
he
knew
what
to
do
with
himself
when
he
was
in
courtroom.
as
i
pointed
out,
he
knew
that
a
formal
motion
for
withdrawal
should
have
been
made.
he
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
ask
for
a
continuance.
he
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
object
and
that
he
did
object.
he
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses
and
that
he
did
cross-examine
witnesses
or
he
examined
witnesses.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes.
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
the
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that
made
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
it
maybe
very
true,
your
honor.
but
we
have
that
based
--
that
--
that
statement
made
in
the
record.
we
must
accept
that
as
a
valid
allegation
just
as
we
must
accept
his
allegation
that
he's
20
years
old
and
uneducated.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
your
honor,
i
would
be
the
last
to
deny
that
in
that
case,
this
court
should
order
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
hold
a
hearing
in
any
case
where
that
matters
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
it
would
depend,
your
honor.
now,
we
would
have
to
file
a
return,
a
formal
return.
we
would
be
required
to
state
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
the
state
--
we
would
actually
start
where
we
were
in
december
of
1957.
the
state
attorney
--
the
attorney
general's
office,
as
counsel
for
the
respondent,
would
be
required
to
file
a
return
where
we
would
either
deny
or
admit,
allege
other
facts.
the
court
then
--
if
not
satisfied,
that
the
attorney
general's
office
has
rebutted
conclusively
the
showing
made
on
paper,
so
to
speak,
they
would
order
a
hearing
held
where
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
the
hearing
would
be
held
in
one
of
our
circuit
courts,
most
probably
in
alachua
county.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
they'd
sent
it
down.
they
are
not
equipped
to
take
testimony
in
any
manner,
they
--
they
just
don't
--
do
not
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
they
could
on
the
basis
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
your
honor.
they
could.
on
the
basis
of
the
return,
require
that
a
hearing
be
held
and
that
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
or
not
be
held
depending
on
what
matters
to
their
satisfaction
the
return
establishes.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
would
be
a
formal
response
or
return
whatever
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
it's
--
it's
almost
a
formalized
matter.
there
has
been
no
formal
joining
of
issue
until
a
return
has
been
filed,
your
honor.
it
--
the
--
the
hearing
is
actually
to
aid
the
court.
they
could
work
or
operate
on
these
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
much
the
way
this
court
does
on
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari,
denied
them
on
their
face.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
file
a
formal
return.
and
that's
my
understanding
of
what
the
procedures
would
be
and
my
understanding
of
what
this
court
could
do
if
they
had
to
be
so
inclined.
the
point
i'm
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
they
will
hold
the
hearing
in
the
trial
court
--
in
the
circuit
court
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
probably
not
before
judge
patton,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he
will
be
called
as
a
witness
for
one
side
or
the
other,
so
it
would
be
one
or
the
other
circuit's
judges
in
that
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
your
honor,
i'll
say
this
that
if
we
are
required
to
file
a
return,
i
will
order
that
transcripts
be
made
up.
i
mean,
i
would
--
i
would
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
need
them
to
--
for
purposes
of
filing
a
formal
return.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
could
not
--
all
i
could
do
would
be
deny
these
allegations.
i
wouldn't
--
we
don't
do
that
in
the
return.
we
would
file
somehow,
we
obtain
the
transcript
of
records.
we
would
have
to
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
we
would
probably
attach
to
our
return
a
copy
of
the
certified
transcript
of
record
or
what
portions
that
we
think
necessary.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no.
i
--
i
don't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
say
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
they
wouldn't
probably
it's
because
recognizing
that
one
party
or
the
other
would
probably
call
judge
patton
as
a
witness
in
this
particular
case.
i'm
sure
that
the
respondent
would
ask
to
have
him
subpoenaed
to
appear.
i
mean,
excuse
me,
the
petitioners.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
he
would
have
to.
he
would
have
to
be
involved
and
so
he
would
be
called
by
one
of
the
parties
to
testify.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
they
may,
i'm
sure
they
would
recognize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
your
honor,
if
that
be
the
case,
there
could
be
a
great
question.
now
i
question,
whether
or
not
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
whether
or
not,
he
--
it
would
be
a
fair
proceeding
in
terms
of
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
the
only
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that's
what
he
seems
to
--
he
alleges
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that's
what
he
charges
and
alleges
here.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
now
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
we
cannot
agree
not
at
a
place
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
into
this,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
it's
denied.
well,
i
--
i
don't
understand
your
question.
is
your
statement
denied
or
he
charged?
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
we
--
we
feel
that
--
that
is
one
of
his
allegations.
that
one
of
his
charges
and
he
argued
--
the
petitioner
argues
in
his
brief
that
he
was
being
tried
for
a
conspiracy
and
that
he
was
not
being
charged
for
the
principal
crime.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
the
youngest
member
of
the
family.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that
seems
to
be
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
and
in
--
in
their
view
when
the
--
the
petitioner
here
was
not
present
during
the
commission
of
the
said
crimes.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that's
the
--
my
understanding
of
this
charge.
i
cannot
draw
such
an
affirmative
statement
from
the
record
before
us.
we
only
have
this
cash
says,
mr.
cash
in
this
case
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
excuse
me,
page
11,
he
says
that
everyone
know
and
i'm
now
quoting
or
summarizing,
everyone
knows
that
ray
cash,
the
petitioner
here,
was
not
a
member
of
the
cash
gang.
well,
of
course,
that
is
true.
everyone
--
we
don't
know
if
everyone
knows
it,
but
accepting
that
is
true,
he
says
the
gang
was
known
as
big
time
operators,
as
the
testimony
of
one
of
its
oldest
members
lawrence
allen,
the
accomplice
in
this
crime,
shows
he
and
other
members
pulled
$180,000
robbery
in
new
orleans.
and
then
he
says
and
the
petitioner,
ray
cash,
was
not
there.
he
does
not
--
is
made
for
this
court
may
feel
that
this
is
running
the
line
very
thin,
but
it
does
not
allege
that
the
testimony
in
the
trial
court
was
that
he
was
not
there.
and
under
our
earlier
argument,
it
may
well
have
been
admissible
evidence
that
they
pulled
this
$180,000
robbery,
when
under
the
statement
earlier
that
he,
the
petitioner
here,
and
fred
and
allen
and
evidently
fred
cash
or
others
had
pulled
other
or
had
perpetrated
other
robberies
of
breaking
and
entering
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
your
honor.
the
--
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
at
all.
the
(inaudible)
is
clear,
as
i
stated
before,
under
certain
circumstances
and
that
this
court
has
stated
the
testimony
of
other
crimes
or
prior
acts
would
be
admissible.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
if
he
were
present.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
if
he
were
not
present,
i
--
i
could
not
substantiate,
under
florida
law,
the
admission,
that's
why
i
say
if.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that's
the
way
i
--
i
construe
this.
that's
the
way
i
construe
this.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
it
is
ambiguous
because
of
his
early
allegation
that
allen
testified
that
cash,
the
petitioner
here,
had
committed
other
robberies
of
breaking
and
entering
is
--
the
legal
definition
may
not
be
too
clear
here.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
you
might
have
had
a
different
case,
your
honor.
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
may
have
had
a
different
case.
but
when
petitioner
then
explains
exactly
what
he
did,
he
bears
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
we
feel
to
this
court
what
many
petitioners
tried
to
do
and
some
successful
bear
allegations
of
error,
gets
him
a
free
trip
out
of
raiford.
we
handle
this
--
start
of
the
record,
we
handle
this
very
often.
bear
allegations
or
error,
coercion
to
a
plea
of
guilty,
a
beating
to
obtain
a
confession,
bear
allegations.
we
have
no
way
of
denying
or
admitting
it
and
so
we
join
issue
and
the
records
fail
to
reflect,
if
there
were
trial
records,
usually
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
there
is
not
that
extent
of
trial
record.
we
have
nothing
in
the
record
to
reflect
whether
or
not,
his
allegations
are
true.
and
so
a
hearing
is
held
and
the
prisoner
gets
a
free
trip
to
the
county
jail
out
of
raiford,
the
state
prison
and
spends
a
day
out
in
the
open
free
air.
now,
we
don't
say
that's
what
happened
here,
but
the
beginning
--
the
early
portion
of
this
petition
is
what
we
are
normally
confronted
with.
we
would
have
gone
to
a
trial,
so
to
speak,
on
those
allegations,
but
he
completely
destroys
those
allegations
when
he
discusses
exactly
what
he
did
and
he
shows
to
my
mind
that
the
only
incapacity
he
suffered
from
was
an
inability
to
defend
himself
with
the
same
degree
of
proficiency
that
a
legal
counsel
with
some
degree
of
skill
and
experience
before
the
bar
could
have.
but
that,
of
itself,
does
not,
in
my
mind
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that,
of
course
again,
we
don't
have
the
trial
record.
we
are
leaning
from
this
as
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well
we
--
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
based
on
the
allegations
he
presents
in
his
portion
called
argument
in
question
1,
that
he
destroys
the
effect
of
his
direct
allegations
and
left
the
supreme
court
with
nothing
saved,
a
statement
or
a
conclusion
that
i
draw
from
this
record
and
that
he
had
no
absolute
right
to
a
petition
--
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
it's
attendant
is
the
consequences
and
circumstances.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
on
the
facts.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
your
question,
sir.
we
feel
and
we
allege
in
our
brief
that
unless
there
is
a
clear
absolute
violation
of
the
federal
right
that
the
states
should
be
permitted
to
conduct
their
own
criminal
procedure
and
to
afford
to
defendants
the
protection,
the
state
feels,
as
forthcoming.
we
feel
that
that
was
done
in
this
case.
that
he
has
not
presented
and
i
remind
the
court
that
we're
here
on
habeas
corpus.
we
are
not
here
on
an
appeal.
there
is
no
full
record.
the
burden
was
on
petitioner
to
show
well,
by
--
clumsily
or
not,
but
to
show
affirmatively
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
his
federal
constitutional
and
or
state
constitutional
rights
were
violated
and
because
of
that,
he
is
now
being
held
in
lawful
custody
and
we
feel
that
he
has
not
done
that
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
whatever
my
personal
feelings
maybe
or
whatever
--
he
has
not
established
that
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
was
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
them
at
that
time
in
denying
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
we
--
we
take
this
position,
your
honor,
that
the
petitioner
as
a
whole,
reflects
that.
now,
we
will
not
rely
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
instrument
was
prepared
of
itself,
but
that
the
allegations
in
this
instrument
reflect
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he
helped
prepare
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
personally,
he
prepared
it.
i
don't
know
who
prepared
it.
now
he
has
alleged
in
a
reply
memorandum
to
my
response
opposing
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
that
he
had
other
friends,
but
that
is
not
the
part
of
this
record.
but
i
will
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
they
are
not
lawyers,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
we
--
we
have
a
problem
in
florida
in
our
state
prison,
we
have
persons
practicing
law
without
license
and
--
and
the
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
it's
not
one
of
them,
your
honor.
we
pride
ourselves
in
certain
things.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he
was
convicted
in
--
in
february
1955.
the
petition
was
filed
approximately
one
week
prior
to
december
10th,
1957.
i
did
not
have
access
to
the
court's
record
when
i
filed
this,
but
it
was
denied
on
the
10th.
so
it
must
have
been
either
a
week
or
two
weeks
prior
to
that
of
1957.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
about
two
years
your
honor.
he
was
then
--
it's
to
the
proceedings
in
this
court
and
(inaudible).
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
we
--
we
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
it
could
get
down
to
that,
but
we
take
the
position
--
and
this
is
not
really
in
two
parts.
he's
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he's
mixed
everything
together.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
--
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
but
what
he
has
done
is
allege
and
then
said
well,
i
--
in
--
in
factual
allegation,
what
i
allege
could
not
possibly
be
true.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
it
can't
be
true.
i
--
i've
destroyed
my
own
allegation.
he
has
rebutted
everything
he
said
and
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
we
--
we
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
your
honor,
i
do
not
personally
believe
he
can.
i
must
be
honest
with
the
court,
my
personal
feeling.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i'm
trying
to
be
as
candid
and
as
honest
as
i
can.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
it
has
been
my
feeling
that
he
can't.
it's
my
feeling
in
terms
of
that
area
of
the
law
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
but
under
the
law
that
exists
today
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
i
feel
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
was
justified
in
doing
what
they
did
for
the
reasons
i
have
set
forth
here.
and
if
i
may
move
on
to
this
ancillary
or
question
that
is
presented,
which
of
course
somehow
meshed
into
the
general
question
the
right
to
a
continuance.
the
rule
in
florida
as
it
prevails
today
is
to
the
effect
that
the
motions
--
motions
for
continuances,
the
denial
of
the
granting
thereof,
are
matters
vested
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
we
have
a
situation
in
this
case
and
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
facts
that
this
man
was
held
in
close
custody.
now
an
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question
to
--
on
mr.
langbein
earlier
this
morning,
i
point
out
that
florida
has
a
statute
that
provides
in
effect
of
i
--
i
do
regret
that
i
do
not
have
the
statutory
authority
in
front
of
me
this
moment.
that
where
a
county
jail
--
where
a
person
confined
in
a
county
jail
or
for
reasons
that
the
county
jail
cannot
adequately
hold
them
or
he
is
a
dangerous
prisoner
and
he
would
not
be
safe
or
could
not
be
confined
in
that
county
jail.he
maybe
transferred
to
another
county
jail
with
the
facilities
for
holding
that
man,
are
--
are
stronger
or
better.
now
i
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
now,
that's
the
point,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
why
he
was
taken
there.
i
must
presume
and
he
doesn't
--
i
must
presume
that
he
was
taken
there
for
a
proper
reason
and
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
and
again
this
is
outside
the
record
that
they
could
not
hold
them
in
alachua
county,
which
is
the
county
where
he
was
tried.
that
there
wasn't
a
jail
in
the
vicinity
and
alachua
county
is
a
small
county
in
the
central
part
of
the
state
quite
possible
and
then
again,
i
say,
i
do
not
know.
raiford
is
a
short,
30,
maybe
50
miles
and
raiford
is
the
farthest
state
prison
from
alachua
county.
the
prison
officials
--
i'm
confident
were
reluctant
to
take
him.
they've
got
enough
trouble
and
i
don't
say
that
in
terms
of
whether
he
was
a
dangerous
person,
but
they
had
another
mouth
to
feed
and
another
cell
to
clean
and
they
were
probably
reluctant
to
take
it.
they
held
him
there
for
--
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of.
he
was
a
--
i
hate
to
use
the
word
dangerous.
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that
would
--
excuse
me.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that's
very
true,
your
honor,
very
true.
his
family
has
a
dangerous
reputation
in
some
parts
of
the
state
now
that
i
--
i'm
from
the
part
of
the
state
where
this
family
lived
for
a
while,
i
know
of
them.
i
don't
know
of
their
history
and
if
travels
have
reached
the
northern
part
of
florida
or
the
central
part
where
this
trial
was
commenced.
but
they
do
in
some
portions
of
the
state
of
florida
enjoy
a
dangerous
or
infamous
reputation.
now,
if
i
may,
he
was
brought
before
the
trial
court.
he
moved
for
a
continuance
in
order
to
secure
counsel.
he
alleges
in
his
petition
that
the
only
reason
the
trial
court
denied
his
motion
for
a
continuance
was
because
the
state
had
gone
to
great
expense
to
bring
witnesses.
we
take
the
position
from
the
record
that
that
could
not
have
been
the
only
reason.
the
record
shows
that
he
had
somebody
attempting
to
procure
counsel
to
represent
him.
that
he
was
held
for
whatever
purposes
and
must
we
not
assume
at
this
point
that
they
were
for
a
lawful
purpose
in
closed
custody.
he
could
not
have,
under
any
circumstances,
easily
conferred
with
a
counsel.
there
would
have
been
a
procedure.
they
would
--
counsel
would
have
gone
to
raiford,
and
which
i
understand
can
--
of
course,
can
be
done,
but
there
was
no
telephone
that
he
could
reach.
he
would
have
to
be
taken
to
the
warden's
office.
so
the
only
person
who
could
logically
talk
to
counsel
attempt
to
procure
counsel
on
his
behalf
was
his
mother.
now,
the
record
shows,
not
very
clear,
but
it
does
establish
that
during
the
week
preceding
the
second
trial,
both
mr.
cash
and
his
mother
were
aware
of
counsel's
withdrawal.
now,
we
admit
that
he
could
not
go
out
and
solicit
counsel.
he
may
have
been
permitted,
if
he
had
asked,
and
we
have
no
allegation
that
he
did
ask
to
use
the
telephone
in
the
warden's
office.
from
my
personal
experience,
i
know
that
has
been
done,
but
he
would
not
have
been
permitted
unconfident
to
make
repeated
trips
to
the
warden's
office.
so
the
only
person
that's
able
--
the
only
person
who
he
would
--
imagine
would
want
to
or
could,
would
be
his
mother
and
his
mother
made
the
--
these
efforts.
and
nowhere
in
the
petition
do
we
have
any
allegation
that
shows
that
she
had
procured
counsel,
that
she
thought
she
had
counsel
except
her
statement
to
mr.
duncan,
the
prosecutor,
during
the
week
preceding
that
--
that
she
had
gotten
counsel
that
day,
but
evidently
did
not
because
no
counsel
appeared.
and
so,
we
submit
that
the
trial
court
had
no
cause
to
delay
any
further.
we
had
no
indication
of
how
long
they
wanted.
was
it
a
day,
a
week,
a
month,
a
year
to
find
counsel
to
search
the
florida
bar,
to
find
somebody
to
represent
this
man
at
the
fee
they
could
afford
to
pay.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
and
it's
under
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
these
--
well,
the
florida
court
has
decided
in
the
case
sneed
versus
state
--
or
mayo,
excuse
me,
and
we
cite
that
in
our
brief,
that
where
the
record
shows
that
the
defendant
could
not
adequately
defend
himself
because
of
age,
ignorance
or
mental
incapacity,
counsel
should
be
appointed
in
a
non-capital
case
where
--
where
petitioner
or
defendant
cannot
secure
his
own
counsel.
florida
law
provides
by
a
statute
that
in
a
capital
case
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
--
counsel
shall
be
appointed
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
in
a
non-capital,
florida
follows
the
general
rule
coming
from
this
court
and
followed
by
most
jurisdictions
that
have
the
--
that
same
type
of
the
statute
that
we
have.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes,
i
point
out
that
we
are
presuming
from
the
record
and
there's
no
allegation
contrary
that
judge
patton,
the
trial
judge
in
the
second
trial,
presided
the
former
trial.
and
he
sat
and
he
watched.
he
saw
a
counsel,
he
saw
cash
and
in
his
discretion
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
we
--
we
take
the
position
he
does,
he
--
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he
did.
he
asked
for
a
motion,
but
continuance
only
alternative
to
appoint
counsel.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
that's
the
allegation.
we
could
not
deny
that.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
very
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
i
--
i
recognized
and
i
made
a
statement.
i
went
to
show
that
he
had
evidently
talked
to
cash
and
he
--
understood
that
he
have
spoken
in
more
than
two-syllable
words
or
he
had
some
familiarity
with
the
english
language
and
knew
what
was
happening,
what
was
going
on
and
that's
only
reason
i
made
that
statement.
not
that
cash
evidently
had
or
had
anything
to
do
with
the
actual
mechanics
of
trying
the
first
cases.
it
must
be
presumed
that
he
didn't
--
he
did
have
counsel.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he
said
he
was
a
farm
boy,
20-year-old
farm
boy.
of
course,
i
know
some
farm
boys
who
were
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
and
--
and
without
formal
education,
who
i
take
pride
and
know
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
but
he
does
make
that
allegation.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
he
does.
and
we
submit
in
conclusion
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
we
don't
have
a
general
public
defender
system,
your
honor.
dade
county,
which
is
the
southern-most
or
one
of
the
southern-most
county,
one
of
the
larger
counties,
it
does
have
a
public
defender
appointed
or
private
county
commissioners
or
some
public
officials
paid
by
the
county
or
the
state.
we
do
not
have
a
statewide.
there
--
from
my
personal
knowledge,
i
may
be
mistaken,
alachua
county
where
this
trial
was
--
was
held
does
not
have
a
public
defender
system,
they
may
have
some
legal
aid
system
worked
out
with
the
attorneys
in
that
county,
but
i
doubt
that.
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
really
know.
jacksonville
area
does
that.
they
had
a
legal
aid
system
worked
out
amongst
the
--
the
attorneys
themselves.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
of
course,
this
court
can
take
into
consideration
any
on
that.
we
even
concede
that
under
the
liberal
rules
of
pleading
in
these
matters
(inaudible)
a
person.
the
allegations
with
the
newspaper
could
be
considered.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
i
plan
to
the
court
that
hung
jury
could
be
the
result
of
many
factors,
not
necessarily
brilliant
work
of
a
trial
counsel.
the
state
may
have
not
failed
to
prove
to
the
satisfaction.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
a
jury
may
not
--
but
this
court
can
take
that
into
consideration.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
one
of
the
facts.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
well,
of
course,
it
--
it's
in
the
record
and
that's
exactly
what
evidently
occurred.
in
conclusion,
we
--
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
--
did
not
have
before
it
the
sufficient
matters
on
which
they
could
or
should
have
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
they
were
justified
in
entering
their
order,
in
december
10th,
1957
denied
the
petitioner's
application.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
certainly,
sir.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
may
i
--
may
i
say
this
that
we
--
in
every
case
that
since
i
have
been
with
the
office,
your
honor,
save
one
and
i
will
explain
that
distinction
in
a
moment.
we
have
made
an
oral
response
or
an
oral
presentation
on
every
petition,
somebody
from
the
criminal
division
of
the
attorney
general's
office.
on
one
occasion
where
it
was
an
obvious
attempt
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
the
court
just
issued
the
writ.
and
we
filed
a
return
and
there
was
no
question
there.
it
was
an
obvious
attempt
that
that
and
nothing
more,
and
the
court
was
going
to
do
it
in
any
event
to
determine
constitutionality,
but
we
usually
filed
some
or
not
filed,
but
made
some
oral
response
to
every
petition.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
what
would
--
this
(inaudible)
this
here,
this
matter
before
this
court?
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
yes.
florida
has
to
finally
resolve
shall
we
say
--
the
coram
nobis
problem
and
although
it's
used
very
rarely,
coram
nobis
rely
in
florida
where
a
matter
is
presented
to
an
appellate
court
and
assuming
there
had
been
an
appeal
in
the
case,
that
was
not
before
the
trial
judge,
but
which
--
if
he
had
known
about,
he
would
not
have
sentenced
or
would
not
have
accepted
to
plea
of
guilty.
there
has
to
be
a
matter
that
the
trial
judge
had
no
knowledge
of,
something
that
would
have
precluded
--
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
coram
nobis
would
not
lie
in
this
matter.
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
no,
it
would
not
lie.
we
have
the
lamb
case
in
florida
and
--
and
subsequent
cases.
it
lies
usually
where
the
defendant
does
not
allege
an
alibi
and
then
it's
later
shown
that
he
was
incarcerated
at
raiford
that
precise
date
the
crime
was
committed.
they
are
following
the
procedures
that
would
be
a
coram
nobis
question.
