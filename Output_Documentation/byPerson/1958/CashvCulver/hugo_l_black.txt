justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
--
that
was
testified
to
in
a
case
against
him
as
he's
committed
another
on
different
crime?
that
--
that's
the
imposition
he
gives
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
why,
would
that
have
been
admissible
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
fair
to
say
that
to
read
this
petition
as
alleging
substance
or
a
young
20
year
old
male,
uneducated,
who
is
the
youngest
member
of
the
family
that
has
the
reputation
of
being
bandits
and
outlaws,
who
is
tried
in
this
trial
when
he
had
a
lawyer,
he
was
to
put
the
trial
again
over
his
objection
when
he
was
insisting
that
he
needed
a
lawyer,
but
rather
couldn't
have.
and
that
he
was
at
that
time,
in
fact,
were
introduced
about
the
other
members,
older
members
of
his
family
who
were
--
has
a
recognition
of
being
bandits
had
been
engaged
in
the
commission
of
crime
with
the
man
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
witness
against
him.
is
that
--
is
that
a
fair
inference
to
be
drawn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
of
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
--
what
--
is
there
any
part
of
that
that
i
stated
that
is
not
fairly
a
--
a
statement
of
what
the
charges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
read
--
i
gathered
that
from
the
charge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he's
charged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
charges
that,
is
that
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
cannot
agree
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
--
has
it
been
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
or
--
is
that
--
do
you
not
read
those
charges
from
what
he
had
alleged
in
his
petition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
was
the
youngest
member
of
the
family.
justice
hugo
l.
black
others
of
whom
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
bandits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
he
was
not
--
he
is
--
not
been
in
this
before
and
not
been
charged
before
this
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
evidence
came
out
that
these
other
members
of
the
family
who
has
a
reputation
of
being
bandits
had
been
engaged
in
banditry
with
the
witness
against
this
man
at
this
time.
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
under
power
of
the
law,
they
could
--
under
any
circumstance,
show
or
pattern
so
that
you
could
pull
the
actual
burglary
or
robbery
by
one
group
against
one
other
person
who
is
not
in
the
group?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
defendant,
but
by
his
accomplices
at
another
place
--time
and
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
if
he
were
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
on
the
basis
that
although
he
charged
(inaudible)
that
you
can't
say
that
those
charges
are
fantastic.
you
wouldn't
dismiss
it
for
that
reason
they're
fantastic
as
he
write
you
but
is
it
on
the
basis
that
because
this
is
a
pretty
well
written
thing
here,
he
somehow
shows
that
he
was
educated
enough
competent
enough
and
capable
enough
to
defend
himself
against
this
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
he
prepared
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
say
they
were
(inaudible)
lawyers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
kind
of
a
jail
[laughs]
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
two
years
after
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
as
i
gather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gather
from
his
petition.
his
family
has
a
very
dangerous
reputation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said,
i
believe
the
petition
said
he
was
raised
on
the
farm
somewhere
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
undoubtedly,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
petitioner
has
asked
for
a
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
might
admit
the
facts.
