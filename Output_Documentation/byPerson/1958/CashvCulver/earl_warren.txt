what
happened
on

what
--
what
was
done
with
it?

ammunition
for
what?
chief

where
is
this?
chief
justice

all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
langbein,
do
you
happen
to
know
if
that
same
character
or
testimony
was
introduced
on
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
whether
he
was
surprised
by
this,
the
second?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice

yes.

(voice

you
may,
mr.
--
mr.
jaffry,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
does
at
the
--
does
the
testimony
in
this
case
show
that
these
other
crimes
amounted
to
a
--
a
general
scheme
or
plan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it's
totally
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jaffry
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
you
very
frankly
stated
that
this
was
a
closed
case,
i
--
i
so
understood
you,
at
least.
now,
i
suppose
you
mean
on
the
--
on
the
facts
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
facts,
yes.
now,
i'm
--
i'm
wondering
if
there
is
anything
in
this
case
other
than
a
decision
of
that
close
question
on
the
facts
that
particularly
bothers
the
state
of
florida
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
is
there
any
important
principle
of
--
of
federal
state
relations
or
anything
of
that
kind
that
would
particularly
disturb
the
state
of
florida
in
this
case,
or
is
it
only
that
you
believe
on
balance
in
this
very
close
case
that
you
are
--
you
are
right
and
that
therefore,
you
should
be
sustained?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jaffry,
do
you
think
this
as
a
practical
matter
that
any
young
man
of
20
years
who
is
uneducated
and
who
has
never
been
in
a
court,
except
for
the
one
experience
just
prior
to
--
to
this
one.
and
who
has
been
for
four
months,
incommunicado
and
advised
just
a
few
days
beforehand
that
his
lawyer
has
deserted
him
that
he
can
be
considered
on
that
short
notice
to
be
able
to
defend
himself,
summon
his
witnesses,
and
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
protect
his
rights.
now,
just
take
those
things
which
i
understand
are
conceded
in
the
record.
you
must
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
you
must
consider
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
say
that
any
young
man
in
those
circumstances
has
the
competence
to
defend
himself
on
an
issue
which
might
and
which,
in
this
case,
did
bring
him
15
years
in
the
penitentiary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
very,
very
correct,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
langbein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
langbein,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
accepting
this
assignment
and
for
--
for
representing
this
indigent
defendant
in
the
--
in
the
very
efficient
and
clear
manner
in
which
you
have
done
it.
and,
mr.
jaffry,
may
i
--
may
i
thank
you,
sir,
for
the
very
fair
and
--
manner
in
which
you
presented
the
issue
on
behalf
of
state
of
--
of
florida
and
also
for
your
frankness,
entire
frankness
with
this
court.
it's
refreshing
to
us
to
see
proceeding
carried
on
in
this
frank
manner
by
both
sides.
