mr.

when
you
said
that
the
reporter
paid
to
transcribe
the
minutes
(inaudible)
only
in
the
second
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
you
don't
know
whether
the
minutes
are
to
you
of
the
first
trial
were
transcribed
before
the
second
trial?
justice

in
any

they
do

of
any
of

witnesses
on

justice
william

(voice

as
i
understand
that
this
testimony
not
of
crimes
of
which
the

is
been
convicted.

testimony

he
had
participated

justice
william
j.
brennan,

allegedly,
participated
in
some
other
crimes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
that's
not
suggested,
but
to
me,
is
what
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
man
was
what,
20
years
old?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
one
--
one
of
the
things
that
the
attorney
general
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
gather
for
our
purposes,
we
have
to
accept
these
facts,
do
we
not,
that
he
was
20
years
of
age,
was
uneducated,
had
never
heard
of
court
trial
except
at
one
time,
kept
the
one
time,
when
he
was
previously
tried
on
this
charge.
do
we
have
to
accept
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering,
where
--
where
is
that
the
court
find
is
the
basis,
although
the
state
finds
the
basis
for
attributing
to
him
some
special
confidence
in
defending
himself
at
his
own
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
we
have
to
accept
the
fact
that
he
was,
do
we
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
could
on
a
basis
of
return.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
ask
to
mr.
jaffry
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
the
supreme
court
rather
than
take
the
action
it
did
here
of
denying,
i
gather
this
was
after
as
you
told
us
earlier
that
had
been
the
opportunity
in
--
until
you'll
do
have
this
10
minute
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
had
decided
there
was
enough
of
a
color
here
of
a
claim
by
the
petitioner,
i
gather
then
what
would've
been
required
was
a
response
from
the
state
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
determination
whether
they
have
a
hearing
is
not
made
until
after
the
state
had
an
opportunity
to
file
a
response.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
if
there
should
be
a
reversal
here,
and
like
mr.
justice
frankfurter
don't
make
any
inference
that
--
suggesting
the
(inaudible)
but
if
there
should
be,
i
gather
that
to
your
supreme
court
will
simply
be
an
indication
that
we
think
there's
enough
of
--
on
the
face
of
this
petition
of
a
color
of
the
claim
that
your
supreme
court
should
then
take
the
next
step
which
would
be
requiring
you
to
file
a
return
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
your
pointing
(inaudible)
actually,
a
testimony
modifies
(inaudible)
testified
that
he
and
other
members
of
the
(inaudible)
$180,000
robbery
in
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
does
not
mean
that
it
was
--
that
testimony
also
included
in
the
testimony
that
petitioner
ray
cash
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
ambiguous.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
like
to
ask
this
one
question
with,
mr.
langbein,
i
--
you
would
fair
with,
really
want
us
--
the
hearing
on
this
petition,
but
i
gather
what
the
attorney
general
told
us
would
happen,
if
we
did
reverse,
you'll
agree
and
what
would
happen
in
the
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
you
might
not?
justice

if

they'll
return
