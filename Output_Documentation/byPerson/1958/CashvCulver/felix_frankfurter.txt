the

justice

do
i
--
what
i
understand
what
is
the
main
case
that
the
petition
drawn
by
the
petitioner
himself,
indigent
convicted
person,
instead
of
making
allegations
in
his

is
incorporated
to
a

account

--
and
that
what
is
set
forth
in

it
should
be
taken
as

may

his
own

and
something
stands,
ready
to
prove.
justice

but
--
but
putting
to
one
side
the
legal
statistics
of
the

it
is
your
position
that
in
order
to
take
this

what
is

was
narratively
set
forth
as
allegations

justice

is
he
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
any
event,
i
think
we've
held
not
in
those
terms,
but
whether
allegations
or
hallucinations
or
not,
is
not
to
be
determined
merely
by
this
--
by
the
allegations
unless
they
are
so
extravagant,
and
so
out
of
this
world
in
a
technical
demand
and
narrow
sense
that's
--
that
on
the
face
of
it,
is
either
observed.
justice

but
as
all
events
as
mr.

unless
the

properly
argue
that
the

that
the
state
--
unless,
the
state
will
argue
subsequently
that
no
such
allegations
are
to
be

are
before
us,
we
must
assume
these
are
allegations
as
though
they
were
put
by
him
in
his
own
person,
his
own
language,
in
narrative
form.
justice
felix

all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
langbein,
i
haven't
realized
until
i
look
at
the
original
paper
(inaudible)
that
what
is
printed
is
what
--
is
the
petitioner
has
filed.
what
is
the
record
--
the
--
the
brown
record
is
what
he
filed
before
your
supreme
court.
and
therefore,
i'm
lead
to
ask
you
whether
argument
and
question,
number
one,
and
all
that
discussions
doesn't
either,
doesn't
prove
either
(a)
that
he
didn't
prepared
it,
himself
or
(b)
if
he
did,
that
it
quite
negatives
the
statement
that
he
didn't
know
court
procedure
how
to
conduct
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
to
impeach
it,
but
it's
difficult
for
me
to
[laughs]
--
to
square
an
allegation
that
he
does
know
anything
about
court
procedure
and
then
have
a
brief
that
was
not
do
--
would
not
to
discredit
to
many
lawyers
of
his,
before
this
court,
i'm
bound
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
myself
has
--
has
defined
that
rather
than
--
and
not
--
as
against
concluding
that
it's
contradiction
of
claims
that
he
didn't
know
what
the
court
keep
doing
without
it.

justice

did

did
the

did

justice

the

have

but
i
--
justice

what?
justice

(voice

that
you
never

justice

(voice

i
don't
think
we've
ever
said
the
case
cites
the
--
the
specific
case.
if
this
state
has
the
most
uncertain
possibilities
to
have
an
appeal
automatically
without
any
different
questions
raised
--
without
any
other
questions
raised,
question
in
whether
a
state
can
say
that
is
such
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
if
you
don't
go
up
on
appeal
directly,
you
can't
give
that
which
brings
habeas

that
is
primarily
being
held
at
that
day,
where
not
in
a
lot
of
system
of
procedure
for
a
state
and
nevertheless,
you
may
raise
independently
in
a
matter
of
--
justice

--
who's
right.
that
would
surprise
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
either
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that's
a
good
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
having
such
burrow
--
burrow
underground
to
find
one,
but
i
just
want
to
know
whether
there
was
an
appeal
and
what's
the
part
of
the
law
was
like
that.
and
in
cases
where
a
state
court
summarily
dismisses
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
i
think
it
is
not
only
our
right,
i
think
it's
our
duty
to
find
out
whether
there
wasn't
a
state
ground
on
which
such
action
was
taken
particularly,
if
the
petition
on
its
face
seems
to
show
a
federal
claim.
i
think
it
would
be
our
duty
if
this
would
be
--
i
feel
that
my
--
not
to
attribute,
disregard
or
settle
constitutional
--
federal
constitutional
principles
by
a
state
supreme
court
rather
look
to
see
whether
there
isn't
a
decent
state
ground.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
wait
for
counsel
the
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
may
well
be
that
--
that
what
i
would
--
the
case
i
put
to
you
was
very
specific
one,
namely
that
the
state
law
was
clear
that
you
have
to
avail
yourself
of
an
obviously
well-known
right
of
appeal
automatically
unhampered
by
any
financial
burdens.
and
if
the
state
came
here
on
such
a
ground,
i'd
have
a
very
different
problem
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
a
good
answer.
so
that
evidently,
there
is
no
such
--
the
state
would
know
such
a
law
if
there
were
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
going
beyond
what
i
found
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
such
petition
probably
the
attorney
general
would
tell
but
i
suppose
so
far
as
(inaudible)
in
dismissing
cases
like
the
--
the
(inaudible)
and
you
think
of,
i
don't
know
whether
through
florida,
but
in
state
courts,
they
have
a
volume
of
business.
they
don't
write
opinions
anymore
than
we
do
in
so
many
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
suggesting
now
is
that
the
memorandum
of
law,
it
makes
really
diluted
the
force
of
the
allegations
of
the
petition
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
noted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
questions,
other
allegations,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
his
mother
--
mother
stated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
necessarily
given
him
a
continuance,
he's
made
to
go
on
without
a
lawyer.
that
means
he
isn't
fairly
--
he's
--
he's
not
capable
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
defend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
if
there's
an
allegation
that
other
lawyers,
at
least
in
part,
refuse
to
take
the
case
or
they
didn't
have
time
to
prepare
so
that
they
couldn't
just
move
in.
now
that
certainly
is
argumentative,
i
believe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix

that
--
that
a
layman
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
layman
qualified
or
not
qualified
who
this
man
was
would
find
it
equally
difficult.
although
he's
been
through
--
he's
been
through
a
prior
trial
and
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
hung
up
at
this
trial
shows
that
it's
a
case
that
requires
some
skill
in
its
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
not
comparing
equal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

i
know
he's
been
through
a
trial
is
not
the
same
as

notice

justice

how

roughly,
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice

what
magnitude

hundreds

did
you
follow

justice

will
you
forgive
me
for
interrupting?
justice

i
understood
that
the
record
of
the
crime
was
not
before
your
supreme

justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

what
was
there
before
the
supreme
court
to
indicate
that
he
competently
handled
his
own
defense?
justice

and
if
not,
it's
--
it's
agreed
that
he's
the
first
offender.
justice

well,
you
must
agree.
justice
felix

you
must
agree.
justice

would
that
--
justice

you
would
surprise
me,
if
you
were
to
tell
me,
you
know
how
i
don't.
that
in
florida
this
rule
as
to
admissibility
of
other
crimes
is
so
clear
and
so
closely
confined
and
defined
that
even
many
lawyer
could
tell
without
examining
all
the
cases
when
it
does
and
when
it
doesn't
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
one
of
the
most
ticklish
subjects
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jurisdictions,
generally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
usually
a
very
limited
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
they
have
to
find
either
an
odd
crime
so
unusual
like
poisoning
by
arsenic
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
unlimited
as
to
time,
or
plan,
or
pattern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that
raises
rather
different
questions
when
those
conditions
for
admissibility
is
satisfied,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
would
it
be
unfair,
mr.
jaffry
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
me
to
say
to
myself,
if
one
other
thing
is
when
--
when
an
infant
withdraws
from
the
self
drawn
decisions
so
called,
with
the
aid
of
present
lawyers,
is
that
--
while
they're
both
secured
has
also
professional
vanity
and
they
like
to
go
around
places
like
a
motion
(inaudible)
the
lord
knows
what
he
actually
said
in
his

said,
he
asked
the
court
whether
there
was
a
formal
motion.
justice

in
the
absence
of
the

whether
--
we
don't
know
what
even
(inaudible)
justice

isn't
that
that
element
or
don't
they
like
to
feel

they're
pretty
good

justice

(voice

at
the
same
time,
they
say,
they
were
wholly
embarrassed
by
their
ignorance.
justice

but
if
the
whole
--
if
the
whole
petition
discloses,
a
kind
of
a
confused
pretentious
ignorance,
a
confused
mind,
then
we
have
--
accepting
it
all,
it
may
had
open
the
fact
that
there
--
whether
the
good
deal
of
strutting

the
formal
verbal
strutting,
there's
also
a
good
deal
of
incapacity

understand
what

justice

what
you
said
about
wouldn't
go

leaving
on
my
mind
the
impression
that
it
is
the
practice
of
your

what
the
conduct
of

court

been
challenged

the

a

case.
justice

there

that

how

justice

mr.

would
--
am
i
oversimplifying
your
position,
your
legal
position
by
what
you
say
that
it
gets
down
to
this
that
while
the
formal
allegations
of
the
petition
on
page

and
down
to
the
first
quarter
of

would
make
out
of
prima

case
we
can
call
for
a
return.
what
follows

in

a

to

although
i
formally
have
made
clear
that
i
was

incompetent
to

must

felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
--
if
--
if
case
were
to
go
back
with
this
--
by
the
supreme
court
and
the
state
then
would
make
a
return
that
mr.
jaffry
told
us
about
and
on
the
basis
of
the
return
so
far
as
the
supreme
court
says,
it's
now
clear
that
he
was
confident
to
handle
himself.
it
is
now
clear,
or
dismiss,
or
--
or
write
a
three-page
--
three-line
of
pages
again
memorandum.
you
could
then
again
come
here
on
that
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
--
just
want
to
see
what
due
course
you
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
just
want
to
see
what
--
what
the
possibility
though.
anyhow,
it
wouldn't
be
concluded.
it
--
it
might
be
concluded
in
trial
of
the
supreme
court,
either
by
extending
it
a
trial
before
a
circuit
court
hearing,
before
a
circuit
court
or
by
denying
it
on
--
on
the
record
and
then
you
would
to
decide,
assuming
you
continue
in
this
case
as
i
drew
in
open
words,
you
would
then
have
to
decide
whether
on
that
record,
it
has
any
portion
coming
up
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
bridge
now,
so
you
can't
cross.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
state
in
effect
has
made
a
talking
demurrer
to
this
--
to
the
petition
and
if
we
say
that
that
demurrer
was
ill-founded,
you
don't
say
that
the
state
procedures
under
(inaudible)
the
--
it
wouldn't
go
back
for
an
opportunity
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
make
a
return.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
the
opposite.
that
you
agree
with
mr.
jaffry
that
what
the
court
has
here,
the
court
threw
this
out,
supreme
court
of
florida,
on
its
face,
on
the
basis
of
what
--
they're
saying
there's
nothing
to
it.
now,
what
a
reversal
would
mean
is
that
there
is
something
to
it
and
therefore
the
state
has
a
right
to
make
its
return
to
show
on
the
fact,
perhaps
by
the
trial
minute
that
there's
nothing
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
