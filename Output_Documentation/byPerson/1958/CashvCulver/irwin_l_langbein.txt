may
i
present
to
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
my
adversary
in
this
case,
mr.
edward
s.
jaffry
of
the
florida
bar
and
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida,
who
is
not
a
member
of
this
bar
and
i
request
that
if
he'd
be
permitted
to
be
heard
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
habeas
corpus
case.
he
comes
here
on
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
record
below
is
very
short,
20
pages
long,
consists
of
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
a
three-line
order
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
denied
the
petition
without
opinion.
the
petitioner
is
a
young
man
of
24.
he
is
an
inmate
of
the
florida
state
penitentiary.
he
is
serving
a
15-year
term
out
of
a
possible
maximum
20
for
burglary.
he
contends
that
his
imprisonment
is
unlawful
because
his
trial
took
place
over
his
objection
without
the
benefit
of
the
presence
of
counsel.
that
was
some
four
years
ago.
he
did
not
appeal,
instead
some
three
years
later,
about
a
year
ago,
he
brought
the
instant
proceeding
originally
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
has
original
jurisdiction
in
these
matters
and
then
here.
he
had
no
counsel
at
any
stage
until
after
the
grant
of
certiorari
here,
when
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
his
petition
alleges
that
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
he
was
only
20
years
old
that
he
was
an
uneducated
farm
boy
and
that
he
had
never
so
much
has
been
inside
a
criminal
trial
court
for
him
to
trial
except
some
10
weeks
before
when
he
had
listened
to
his
own
previous
trial
on
the
same
charge.
then
he
had
been
represented
by
experienced
and
paid
criminal
counsel.
that
trial
resulted
in
a
mistrial,
hung
jury.
he
was
then
sent
to
solitary
confinement
where
he
remained
for
the
10
weeks
intervening
between
that
trial
and
the
present
trial
of
which
he
is
now
complaining.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
sir,
i
wish
someone
would
explain
it
to
me.
i'm
reporting
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner,
if
it
--
i'm
ashamed
to
say
that
it
happened
sometime
in
florida.
this
is
not
the
first
case
that
i
think
house
against
mayo
have
that
feature
in
it,
too.
perhaps
there
are
reasons
why,
but
i
don't
know
them.
after
he'd
been
there
for
a
period
which
isn't
entirely
certain,
either
a
week
before
the
trial
or
four
days
before
the
trial,
there
are
conflicting
allegations
in
his
petition.
he
received
notice
that
his
first
counsel
had
withdrawn
from
the
case
or
was
going
to
withdraw
from
the
case
either
one.
he
could
do
nothing
about
it,
of
course,
but
his
mother
knew
about
it
and
she
then
immediately
set
about
trying
to
get
him
some
counsel.the
petition
recites
that
she
saw,
"a
number,"
unspecified
of
lawyers,
but
that
they
all
refused
to
take
the
case
because
the
amount
of
money
she
could
offer
as
a
fee,
the
amount
is
unspecified,
was
insufficient
and
because
the
time
for
preparation
was
insufficient.
that
time
was
either
four
days
or
a
week,
we
don't
know.on
trial
day,
or
retrial
day,
the
petitioner
explain
these
facts
to
the
trial
judge
and
asked
for
a
continuance
to
find,
go
out
and
hire
a
counsel.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i'm
sure
he
had.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes.
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
he
had
gotten
permission
and
that
he
had
shown
the
court
adequate
cause
why
he
should
withdraw.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
the
same
trial
judge.
that
appears
in
the
record
in
a
rather
shadowy
way
and
i
know
counsel
won't
mind
by
going
outside
the
record
because
i
detect
some
flavor
of
suspicion
of
--
of
the
--
the
actions
of
this
attorney,
who
is
a
rather
eminent
fellow
at
our
criminal
bar.
he
did
notify
the
court
that
he
intended
to
withdraw.
i
think
you
can
detect
from
the
record
as
i
develop
the
facts
later,
a
very
good
reason
why
he
should
withdraw,
although
i
have
not
consulted
with
him.
he
happens
to
be
in
asia
at
that
time
and
i
--
i
don't
know
precisely
why
he
withdrew,
but
he
did
withdraw
a
week
or
five
or
four
days
before
the
trial.
the
petitioner
reported
to
the
court.
his
efforts
to
obtain
or
his
mother's
efforts
to
obtain
counsel
in
this
very
short
period,
asked
for
a
continuance,
the
court
said
no.
there
are
a
lot
of
witnesses
there.
the
state
had
gone
to
a
great
expense
to
get
him.
he
had
to
go
to
trial
that
day.
then
he
asked
for
appointment
of
counsel,
three
counsels
refused.
the
reason
doesn't
appear,
but
of
--
of
course,
we
--
we
know
what
it
was.
it's
perfectly
standard
in
florida.
no,
i
won't
say
it's
perfectly
standard
in
florida.
florida
does
authorize
as
this
court
had
seen
a
number
of
cases,
wade
against
mayo
is
the
leading
one,
that
there'll
be
paid
counsel,
free
only
in
a
capital
case
and
this
isn't
a
capital
case,
20-year
maximum
sentence
to
which
the
boy
got
15.
the
trial
then
proceeded.
the
petitioner
defendant
himself,
the
pattern
of
the
trial
was
primarily
that
of
an
accomplice
case.
a
fellow
named,
allen,
lawrence
allen,
who
was
a
codefendant
with
him,
pleaded
guilty,
turned
state's
evidence
and
testified
against
him.
and
there
was
corroboration
in
the
form
of
evidence,
that
loot
from
the
burglary
had
turned
up
in
allen's
possession,
so
that
it
was
clear
from
the
corroboration
that
allen
had
--
had
a
part
in
the
crime,
but
in
this,
i
stress,
there
was
nothing
in
the
evidence
except
the
uncorroborated
word
of
allen
that
the
petitioner
had,
along
with
allen,
taken
part
in
the
trial,
taken
in
--
in
the
crime.
let
me
--
let
me
quote
what
i
think
is
the
crucial
sentence
from
the
record
page
4."
there
was
nothing
that
would
connect
allen
and
the
petitioner
except
allen's
word."
the
testimony
of
allen
was
that
he
and
the
petitioners
and
some
people
had
committed
the
burglary
charged.
now,
in
what
i've
said.
i'm
--s
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
sir?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
page
4
of
the
record
which
is
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
from
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
petition.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
that
is
his
own
allegation
there
in
the
record
below.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
sir?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
his
reward
was
10
years
suspended
sentence.
a
factor
which
in
the
terms
of
townsend,
burke,
i
guess
it
is,
suggests
that
the
absence
of
counsel
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
severity
of
the
sentence
because
this
boy
was
a
first
defendant
and
15
years
appears
to
one
without
knowledge
of
the
record
as
--
as
a
rather
brutal
sentence
under
those
circumstances
on
one
that's
whether
counsel
might
not
have
done
him
some
good
in
pointing
out
the
factors
that
would
ordinarily,
i
would
say,
prevent
such
a
very
severe
sentence.
however,
that
is
not
the
gravamen
of
the
petition.
i
think
it's
claim
from
what
i've
said
so
far
and
indeed,
it
must
have
been
plain
some
months
ago
when
certiorari
was
granted
that
what
we're
doing
here
is
appealing
to
the
body
of
doctrine
that's
grown
up
in
this
court's
since
betts
against
brady
to
the
effect
that
in
a
non-capital
case,
in
a
state
court,
where
a
man
has
been
deprived
of
counsel
over
his
objections,
over
that
opportunity
to
object,
here,
you
object
strenuously.
this
court
will
grant
habeas
corpus
relief
if
it
falls
into
certain
patterns.
one
of
them
is
the
pattern
of
inadequate
time
to
obtain
counsel.
i
don't
propose
to
review
the
cases
here
in
terms
of
how
long
is
long,
how
high
is
up,
that
--
that
isn't
going
to
help.
i
think
most
of
the
cases
are
--
might
not
concede
this
shorter
times
as
a
more
sudden
need
for
a
counsel.
i
feel
here
that
this
particular
period
of
time
is,
itself,
not
important,
but
what
is
important
is
the
report
of
the
attorneys
whom
the
petitioner's
mother
consulted
which
is
in
the
record
that
the
reason
they
turned
her
down
was
twofold,
(1)
insufficiency,
(2)
not
enough
time
to
prepare
for
a
trial.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
this
stage
of
the
case
they
petitioned,
where
the
petitioner
hasn't
had
an
opportunity
to
go
into
the
facts
and
demonstrate
what
happened
here
that
where
the
attorneys,
themselves,
are
reported
as
saying
that
they
don't
think
that
this
period
of
a
week
or
four
days,
whichever
it
is,
is
enough,
but
that's
conclusive,
that's
binding.
if
that
report
is
made
and
that
is
substantiated
by
the
evidence
when
we
come
to
trial
on
this,
that's
the
case,
because
this
is
one
of
the
rather
rare
situations
in
which
the
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
go
out
and
hire
your
own
counsel
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
absolute.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
these
are
not
affidavits.
this
record
is
--
this
--
this
record
is
in
a
peculiar
form.
what
i'm
reciting
is
a
newspaper
account
of
the
trial.
the
petitioner
didn't
have
the
money
to
go
out
and
print
out
his
record,
here.
and
what
i'm
reciting
here
comes
from
a
newspaper
reporter's
account
of
the
trial
which
is
put
into
the
trial
record.
i'm
sorry,
which
is
put
under
the
habeas
corpus
record,
most
of
it
in
the
argumentative
portion,
rather
than
in
the
statement
of
facts.
the
petition,
itself,
has
sworn
to,
of
course.
i
should
add
that
i
think
this
is
a
novel
procedure.
i'm
not
a
habeas
corpus
expert.
this
is
my
first
and
i
hope
my
last
habeas
corpus
case.
i
have
never
run
across
a
case,
at
least,
among
the
reported
cases
in
which
the
petitioner
relied
for
part
of
the
support
of
his
petition,
upon
on
newspaper
account
on
what
happened.
and
i
thought
the
point's
efficiently
novel
that
i
made
it
a
third
distinct
point
or
question
in
the
brief.
counsel
accommodated
me
by
not
contesting
the
validity
of
that
procedure,
that's
not
one
of
the
issues
as
counsel
view
them.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
substantially
that,
sir.
this
particular
passage,
for
example,
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
and
at
top
of
page
3
of
the
brown
printed
record.
and
you'll
see
that
it's
a
m√©lange
of
allegation
and
quotation
and
is
in
that
way
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
way
the
brief
is
--
is
set
out.
of
course,
the
state
has
its
own
view
as
to
the
content
and
the
--
and
the
circumstances,
but
the
--
the
technique
of
incorporating
newspaper
accounts
has
not
been
objected
to
at
least
in
the
briefs.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
he
alleges
that
it
was
prepared
by
the
--
by
himself.
in
another
paper
filed
in
this
court,
he
says
he
had
some
help
from
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
from
jailhouse
lawyers.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
precisely.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that's
right.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
let
me
point
out
that
there's
always
a
flavor
of
--
is
this
fellow
star
crazy?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
is
he
hallucinating?
is
this
--
can
--
can
this
be
believed
and
here's
a
man,
when
he
doesn't
have
a
transcript,
brings
to
bear
the
--
the
independent
credibility
of
something
in
cold
public
print.
at
least,
something
like
this
happened,
he
is
saying.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
let
me
suggest
perhaps
of
the
reason
they
did
this
is,
well,
i
don't
know
you.
you
can't
tell
why
i
may
and
under
--
under
that
kind
of
advice
does
things,
but
--
but
i
would
think
it
very
wise
of
into
--
to
do
that
anyhow,
no
matter
what
the
paper
rule
is
particularly
in
this
court,
a
man
may
want
to
persuade
other
people
at
that
--
that
what
he
says
is
--
is
to
be
taken
with
--
with
a
little
more
respect
and
if
it
were
some
wild
yarn
that
--
that
he
control
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes,
precisely.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
within
the
general
rule,
a
very
loose
construction
of
habeas
corpus
pleadings.
now,
these
allegations
also
sound
aside
from
the
deprivation
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
of
the
right
to
paid
counsel
--
sir?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
this
is
all
part
of
petition.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
this
is
a
whole
petition.
this
record
consists
of
nothing
but
the
petition
and
the
three-line
ought
to
turning
it
down.
everything
in
here
is
petition.
now,
on
the
other
head
of
betts
and
brady,
i
think
what
i
have
said
indicates
some
of
the
standard
ground
for
relief.
at
least
that
brings
it
within
the
--
the
scope
of
an
appeal
to
them.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
don't
think
it
appears
so
affirmatively
that
i
--
that
i
want
to
stress
it.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
would
rather
stay
on
what
i
considered
to
be
the
wholly
firm
ground.
i
think
that
--
i
--
i
think
it's
arguable
that
there
would
have
been
some
opportunity
to
confer
even
in
solitary.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
whether
we
should
go
into
the
--
the
impeachment
of
--
of
this
allegation.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
--
i
believe
that
it
was
one
of
your
cases
that
suggested,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
pretty
good
specialists
in
habeas
corpus
law
and
at
the
outset
i
said
that
although
this
petition
indicates
that
its
pro
section,
another
paper
they
filed
in
this
court.
i
think
a
petition
for
certiorari
indicates
that
he
has
had
the
assistance
of
--
of
lawyers
and
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
you
--
you
suggest,
mr.
justice,
that
--
that
this,
itself,
demonstrates
that
he
--
that
he
knew
what
court
procedure
is
all
about?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
remember,
he
had
four
years
under
expert
guidance.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
precisely.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
this
is
fourth
--
this
is
three
year
--
three
years
later
that
he
-
that
he
filed
this
illuminating
document.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
go
on
to
another
point,
mr.
justice,
which
--
which
i
had
intended
to
take
up
a
little
bit
later,
but
which
i
think
i
should
take
up
now,
in
response
to
that
suggestion
which
is
that
this
boy
was
such
a
bad
lawyer
that
he
didn't
know
how
badly
he
had
been
treated
in
this
--
in
this
trial,
even
after
three
years
and
even
after
the
expert
advise
of
the
jailhouse
faculty
of
law.
because
you
will
notice
that
he
makes
a
statement
of
facts
which
is
only
two
pages
long
and
that's
substantially
what
i've
recited
so
far.
and
the
rest
is
this
--
this
elaborate
legal
argument,
citing
cases
and
so
on,
but
stuck
away
in
the
corners
of
this
legal
argument
were
its
ammunition
for
dud
arguments.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
dud
arguments,
useless
arguments,
arguments
that
just
sputter
and
don't
explode
is
what
i
think
is
the
most
devastating
thing
in
this
case.
in
the
cause
of
an
argument
which
relates
to
what
i
think
a
foolish
contention
about
the
wealth
of
the
accomplice
witness
and
his
own
property,
the
petitioner
says
that
in
the
course
of
the
trial
the
accomplice
witness,
allen,
testified
to
other
crimes
committed
not
by
petitioner,
but
by
petitioner's
brothers
--
ray
cash
is
this
petitioner.
he
is
the
baby
brother
of
the
family.
and
this
petition
alleges
that
the
family
is
a
notorious
criminal
gang.
thus
by
indirection,
not
at
all
in
--
in
the
course
of
what
facts
he
thought
was
important,
occurs
this
situation.
the
witness
testifies
that
members
of
the
petitioner's
family
take
part
in
a
$180,000
robbery
in
new
orleans.
and
that
petitioner
wasn't
there.
certainly,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
that
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
any
lawyer
of
the
minimum
three
years
experience
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
just
mentioned,
would
have
sense
enough
to
get
up
and
howl
about
to
a
trial
court
or
get
up
to
an
appellate
court
and
have
it
reversed.
that
is,
to
my
mind,
the
most
outrageous
thing
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
alleges
in
his
garbled
and
backwards
way
that
his
brothers
are
members,
indeed
ring
leaders,
of
this
notorious
criminal
gang
known
as
the
cash
gang.
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
in
florida,
at
least,
that
there
is
such
a
gang
and
yet
testimony
as
to
a
completely
other
crime
which
this
man
is
not
suppose
to
have
any
part
at
all
is
lugged
into
this
case.
to
cap
it
all,
the
real
relevance
of
that
--
that
what
makes
it
worst
than
usual
is
that
there
is
testimony
by
the
same
accomplice
that
one
of
the
people
who
is
alone
when
they
robbed
or
burglarized
rather,
the
particular
store
involved
in
the
information,
in
little
college
town
of
gainesville,
florida
was
fred
cash,
one
of
the
same
is
same
cash
brothers.
so
that,
call
it
what
you
will
(inaudible)
guilt
by
association
that
had
no
business
in
this
trial
and
that
is
the
prime
example
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no,
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
the
stenographic
transcript
is
available
and
what
we
want
really
is
an
opportunity
on
these
clumsy
allegations
to
get
hold
of
that
transcript
and
find
out
what
really
did
happen
here.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no,
sir.
it
has
not
been
transcribed.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
the
trial
took
--
took
two
days,
i
--
i
believe.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
don't
know.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
know
that
he
cross-examined,
wait
a
minute.
i
don't
know
that
he
cross-examined
the
witnesses.
he
might
--
he
might
have,
i
--
i
know
that
he
made
objections,
i
know
that
he
--
yes,
he
must
have
cross-examined
the
witnesses.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
let
me
--
let
me
quote
in
the
record
--
sir?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
--
again,
i
can
suspect
so
which
of
course
is
one
of
the
factors
the
tends
to
make
a
second
trial
complicated.
the
kind
of
a
thing
you'll
liked
it
and
needed
a
lawyer
for,
because
everybody
who's
ever
tried
a
case
knows
that
the
--
that
you're
trying
to
present
every
witness
with
the
dilemma
of
either
you're
a
parrot
saying
what
you've
been
told
to
say
in
your
first
trial
or
you're
a
liar
and
i'm
impeaching
you
because
you're
wandering
away
from
what
you've
said.
that
--
that
takes
a
little
technique.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
can
quote,
mr.
jaffry
on
that
that
the
minutes
of
the
trial
were
not
before
the
court,
is
that
correct?
mr.
jaffry
attended
the
supreme
court
hearing.
i
did
not.
i
didn't
get
in
the
case
of
that
stage.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
these
slim
20
pages
is
all
that
they
had
before
them
at
that
time.
i
may
say
that
it's
--
that
it's
available.
i
found
that
out.
the
court
reporter
is
ready
to
put
it
out.
i
assumed
that
somebody
pushed
two
or
$300
in
our
hand.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
didn't
catch
the
last
part
of
the
question.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that's
it.
this
is
an
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
this
an
allegation
stage.
we
want
a
chance
to
try
this
out.
we
want
this
real
issue
so
that
this
record
can
be
brought
up
and
--
and
we
can
--
we
can
see
and
anybody
can
see
whether
--
whether
this
man
is
talking
utter
nonsense
or
not.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
i
do
not
find
that
in
the
record,
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
apparently,
the
latter,
but
there
again,
i
think,
mr.
jaffry
can
answer
that
question
better
than
i
can,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
didn't
ask
for
about
the
first
trial.
i
didn't
think
it
important
at
the
time.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
--
i'm
--
i
think
she
would've
told
me
if
they've
been
available.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
presume
that
in
accordance
with
standard
florida
practice,
they're
up
in
a
dusty
attic
somewhere
and
as
--
as
soon
as
we
--
we
want
them
and
can
pay
for
them,
we'll
get
them.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no,
no.
we
--
we
have
--
we
have
no
knowledge
of
the
actual
detail
of
the
trial
except
what
happened
here.
let
me
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes.
what?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
and
knowing
--
knowing
that
small
florida
area,
there
i
--
i've
never
heard
of
any
judge
up
there
but
judge
patton,
at
the
rather
unusual
for
anybody
to
go
in
there
in
his
--
in
his
jurisdiction
there.
let
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
not
shown.
not
shown,
not
shown
whether
he
took
the
stand.
none
of
these
things
are
shown,
but
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
we're
dealing
here
with
allegations.
they
--
all
we
want
is
an
opportunity
to
have
them,
answer
them
if
it
should
turn
out
that
there
are
circumstances
such
as
--
that
he
put
on
elaborate
bunch
of
witnesses,
that
he
did
a
brilliant
cross-examination,
you
know
one
of
these
walter
mitty
stunts,
whereby
he
looked
like
these
lawyers
you
see
on
saturday
night
on
tv,
every
layman's
dream.
i
don't
think
it
happened
here.
let
me
--
let
me
quote
a
bit
more
on
that
point
from
the
--
from
the
record.
this
is
the
gainesville
sun
reporter's
impression
of
this
again.
this
--
it
gets
back
to
justice
harlan's
question.
he
says,
"while
making
objections
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
page
14
of
the
record.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
"while
making
objections
and
inquiring
of
the
judge
and
witnesses,
cash
appeared
unsure
of
himself.
on
several
occasions
he
would
start
a
sentence
then
stop
to
rephrase
it
or
start
on
another
subject.
before
making
objections,
cash
raised
his
hand
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
judge
and
then
in
a
halting
manner
would
make
his
statement.
or
again
--
on
--
on
page
14
you
find
a
passage
in
which
the
boy
was
foolish
enough
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
a
revolver
which
was
taken
from
the
store
and
identified
as
turning
up
in
--
in
the
possession
of
--
of
his
accomplice
witness.
the
most
obviously
admissible
corroborative
evidence
is
that
there'd
be
no
excuse
for
a
sensible
lawyer
to
get
up
and
--
and
object
to
anything
like
it
--
that.
and
yet
it's
perfectly
elementary
that
the
--
the
best
way
to
prejudice
a
jury
against
you
is
to
make
silly
objections.
now,
this
was
a
complicated
trial.
this
--
as
--
as
his
evidence
by
the
fact
that
this
very
able,
experienced
criminal
lawyer
from
miami,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
he's
able,
that
this
man
of
experience
had
been
able
to
get
the
boy,
at
best,
a
hung
jury.
when
you
couple
all
of
these
factors
together,
together
with
one
more
which
is
perhaps
anticlimax,
a
violation
of
the
state
rules
of
evidence
in
an
important
respect,
i
think
we're
--
we're
getting
a
sort
of
cumulative
picture
of
a
--
of
a
rump
of,
a
frolic,
rather
than
of
a
fair
trial.
that
episode
which
i
haven't
yet
mentioned
because
i
wanted
to
talk
particularly
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
about
this
other
episode
of
a
completely
unfair
trial
resulting
from
the
introduction
of
the
testimony
of
find
in
which
the
petitioner
had
no
part
at
all.
that
other
episode
is
this,
allen,
the
coconspirator
was
permitted
to
testify
that
he
and
the
petitioner
and
these
other
boys,
including
his
brother,
committed
not
alone
this
burglary,
but
one
other
burglary
that
they
stole
a
truck
and
that
they
had
a
running
gun
battle
with
the
police,
presumably
all
in
part
of
the
same
raid
although
the
timing
isn't
--
isn't
--
doesn't
appear.
now,
there
are
three
other
crimes
there,
one
more
burglary,
a
larceny
of
the
truck,
resisting
arrest.
now,
it's
elementary
that
other
crime
testimony
is
admissible
under
certain
various
specific
limitations,
identity
impeachment,
planned
purpose
and
so
on,
but
that
unless,
it
is
excused
because
of
some
particular
exceptional
rule
of
law,
it
is
highly
dangerous.
it's
hard
to
--
to
meet.
it
causes
confusion
of
issues
as
even
a
little
constitutional
flavor
under
the
sixth
amendment,
there
about
knowing
the
charge
against
you.
and
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
no
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
another
--
his
first
--
through
the
first
amendment,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
do
not.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
do
not.
i
have
no
knowledge.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
might
be
matter
of
defense
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
to
be
--
to
be
brought
up
when
we
get
the
full
record
here
that
we're
trying
to
get
and
find
out
about.
now,
there
was
this
testimony
of
three,
four
--
of
the
three
other
crimes.
there
is
a
rule
of
law
in
florida,
in
the
area
of
accomplice
testimony,
florida,
of
course,
is
afraid
of
accomplice
testimony
just
--
just
like
most
states
are.
it's
hedged
about
with
various
restrictions
because
it's
--
it's
so
dangerous.
and
one
of
the
rules
of
law
that
we
have
in
florida,
although
we
allow
conviction
on
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
accomplices,
which
about
half
the
states
don't,
one
of
our
restrictive
rules
of
law
in
this
area
is
that
we
impose
a
special
restriction
on
the
use
of
other
crime
testimony
in
an
accomplice
case.
that
is
to
say,
you
take
these
two
dangerous
elements,
other
crime
testimony
which
is
permissible
under
certain
circumstances.
you
take
this
other
dangerous
element
of
accomplice
testimony
which
is
permissible
under
certain
circumstances,
put
them
together
they
explode,
you
have
error.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
in
a
case
just
about
three
years
before
this
case
came
to
trial.
a
parallel
case
of
a
burglary
and
testimony
by
the
accomplice
as
to
a
--
a
general
raid,
other
burglaries,
in
fact
even
a
car
theft,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
that
that
testimony,
although
it
might
be
admissible
in
an
ordinary
case
within
these
exceptions
of
the
other
crime
rule
was
not
admissible
in
this
accomplice
case
because
it
was
nothing
but
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
that
connected
the
petitioner
with
this
crime.
there
is
that
special
limitation
of
florida
law
and
--
and
a
very
wise
one.
now,
i
--
i
don't
take
the
position
that
--
that
every
violation
of
a
state
court
rule
of
evidence
is
--
is
an
unfair
trial.
but
i
do
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
significant
violation
of
a
state
court
rule
of
evidence
designed
to
obtain
a
fair
trial.
and
that
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
lawyer
could
have
stopped
or
they
couldn't
have
stopped
it
there,
he
could
have
stopped
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
appeal,
because
there
is
this
case
peculiarly,
opposite
which
says
that.
now,
one
of
the
issues
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
issue
of
whether
this
supreme
court
of
florida
case
says
just
that.
counsel
has
questions
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no,
sir.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
yes.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
yes.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
excuse
me.
i'm
--
i'm
guessing
a
little,
but
i
--
would
amaze
me,
if
i
were
wrong.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that
in
a
--
that
in
a
right
to
counsel
case.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
no.
no.
in
a
right
it's
the
other
way
around
and
right
to
counsel
case,
you
don't
have
to
take
an
appeal.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
the
same
as
here.
in
fact,
if
--
if
it
weren't,
the
--
the
law
that
was
laid
down
here
in
cases
like
palmer
and
ashe
would
govern,
where
were
you
deprived
of
counsel,
where
your
allegation
is
that
you
were
deprived
of
counsel,
you're
not
suppose
to
be
lawyer
enough
to
know
--
to
know
that
you
have
a
right
to
appeal.
and
you
can
come
in
much,
much
later
than
this
in
a
habeas
corpus.
that
--
that
--
i
thought
this
court
had
settled
it.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
i
would
say
this,
that
you
said
so
many
things
broader
than
that,
that
this
one
would
amaze
me.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
would
say
that
in
this
area,
this
court
has
said
so
many
things
in
favor
of
petitioners
that
are
broader
than
that.
that
you
can
go
up
after
--
after
years
and
under
all
sorts
of
circumstances
that
introducing
that
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that
new
wrinkle
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
didn't
think
so
that
you
had
held
precisely
that
i
was
talking
of
the
analogous
cases,
but
a
while
ago,
i
said,
i
hope
this
is
my
last
habeas
corpus
case,
i
like
that
--
that
one.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
no,
there
has
--
may
--
may
i
say
this.
that
at
this
stage
of
the
case
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
there
has
been
no
suggestion
at
all
of
--
of
adequate
state
ground.of
course,
it's
up
to
the
court
to
find
the
many
time
that
it
--
it
wishes
to.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
there
was,
let
--
let
me
be
fair.
in
the
brief
in
our
opposition
to
the
petitioner
for
certiorari,
there
was
another
suggestion
of
--
of
adequate
state
ground
that
the
idea
that
this
was
all
a
matter
of
discretion
with
respect
to
--
to
how
long
you
had
to
postpone
a
trial,
or
whether
you
had
to
postpone
trial
at
all.
and
in
that
--
in
that
passage
in
the
brief,
the
stand
that
adequate
state
ground
cases
were
cited
and
it
--
it
looked
as
though
we're
going
to
have
an
adequate
state
ground
dispute
here.
for
that
reason,
by
anticipation,
i
address
myself
to
that
in
the
main
brief
on
that
for
the
petitioner
and
so
far
i
haven't
stirred
up
any
response.
i
--
i
think
that
the
adequate
state
ground
ideas
out
of
this
case
at
least
as
far
as
counsel
are
concerned.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i'm
--
i'm
not
suggesting
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
the
state
has
made
that
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
contention
in
any
event.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
would
--
i
--
i
would
assume,
sir.
but
i
--
perhaps
i
might
--
might
go
a
little
further
there
and
state
what
i
think
resolves
this
mystery
of
why
the
state
court
cut
him
off
so
quickly.
that
three-line
order
on
facts
that
i
have
recited
looks
--
looks
a
little
harsh.
and,
i
think,
the
reason
why
the
state
court
gave
no
opinion
here
will
be
apparent
if
you
read
this
masterpiece
of
jurisprudence.
it
--
it
isn't
as
good
as
the
citation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
there
are
a
lot
of
nice
citations
that
it's
an
impertinent
and
scandalous
job.
there
are
number
of
things
suggestions
of
bribery
of
the
judge,
suggestions
of
--
of
this
--
this
lawyer
running
out
on
the
man
which
don't
rise
to
the
dignity
of
allegations.
but
they're
the
kind
of
things
that
--
that
makes
you
impatient
with
--
with
this
sort
of
allegation.
and
i
can
well
conceive
how
an
earnest
state
supreme
court,
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
worse
of
the
case
--
the
--
the
really
aggravated
examples
of
unfair
trial,
use
of
other
crime
testimony
in
both
aspects,
weren't
at
all
set
out
in
the
statement
of
facts,
but
you
have
to
dig
them
out
in
three,
four
places
from
this
big
long
murky
argument.
i
can
well
understand
why
a
court
is
busy
as
the
supreme
court
of
florida
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
would
--
would
turn
it
down.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
it's
a
difficult
problem.
there
--
there's
that
--
that
illinois
(inaudible)
where
--
where
you
never
know
what's
going
to
happen.
you
don't
get
any
guidance
from
the
court.
but
i
--
i
sincerely
believe
from
my
experience
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
--
that
this
is
simply
a
dismissal
on
a
petition
that
--
that
looks
as
though
it's
not
saying
anything
beyond
what
could
be
a
fairly
closed
case
about
which
reasonable
men
could
differ
perhaps,
particularly
if
it
were
presented
without
counsel
to
point
out
what
is
said
in
an
indirect
and
garbled
way
in
a
newspaper
account.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
use
a
stronger
word
than
dilute.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
unless
the
court
wishes
to
address
some
questions
to
me
i
have
nothing
further
to
argue.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
oh,
precisely.
ultimately,
i
think
we'd
wind
--
we'd
wind
up
for
the
hearing.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
might
not.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
we
want
--
we
want
the
facts
to
be
dugout
one
way
or
another.
i'm
not
interested
in
having
my
boy
get
a
free
ride.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
might,
but
i
have
a
better
record
to
do
it,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
well,
perhaps
i
have
a
worse
record.
i
don't
know.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
in
any
event
i
wasn't
just
speculating
as
we
are
doing.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
right.
i
crossed
that
bridge
when
i
came.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
the
important
thing
now
is
that
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
i
know.
i
just
don't
want
to
cross
any
bridges
about
where
(inaudible)
belong
in
this
petition.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes,
but
the
precise
nature
of
his
hearing
is
one
that
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
--
the
state
law
can
determine.
there
maybe
no
issue
of
fact
here.
it
maybe
that
this
is
determined
--
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
that
this
--
that
this
is
determined
precisely
on
--
on
the
basis
of
a
record
which
supports
me,
if
so,
there's
--
there's
nothing,
but
a
question
of
law
as
to
whether
on
those
facts,
the
--
the
--
there
was
a
good
cause
of
action.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
there
may
be
no
need
for
testimony.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
do
you
mean,
mr.
justice,
that
i
should
expect
my
boy
to
walk
out
of
raiford?
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
yes,
this
court
would
in
effect
have
overruled
the
demurrer.
mr.
irwin
l.
langbein
thank
you.
