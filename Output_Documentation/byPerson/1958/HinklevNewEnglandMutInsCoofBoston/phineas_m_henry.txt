mr.
phineas
m.
henry
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
not
familiar
with
whether
or
not
your
honors
have
had
any
provision
â€“
(inaudible)
about
this
case
but
if
you
haven't
i
am
sure
that
you
don't
know
anything
about
the
facts
of
it
by
misstatement
of
opposing
counsel.
the
receipt
is
what
is
called
a
conditional
receipt
and
it
contains
not
only
the
proviso
which
he
read,
but
a
second
proviso,
first
proviso
that
he'll
be
in
good
health
and
second
that
he
furnish
evidence
of
his
insurance
--
satisfactory
evidence
of
his
insurability.
this
was
on
a
priority.
an
arrangement
the
--
after
the
application
had
been
signed
the
agent
said,
when
can
you
take
the
medical
examination
and
he
said
that
day.
there
is
some
slight
conflict
about
whether
this
was
forenoon,
or
afternoon
or
who
called
the
doctor,
but
any
how
they,
in
his
presence
they
called
the
doctor
and
they
arranged
that
the
examination
be
held
that
day
and
then
the
applicant
said
stop
i've
got
to
be
away,
i'm
going
away
and
they
arranged
to
have
it
on
monday.
then
he
signed
up
the
application
and
in
the
application
in
answer
to
the
question
there
is
a
proposed
insured
plan
to
make
him
fly
as
trainee
pilot
or
a
crew
member
or
has
he
made
such
flights
in
ten
years,
he
said
no.
as
flying
(inaudible)
as
his
flying
time
--
well
this
is
above
(inaudible)
he
said
no.
beyond
an
air
plane
he
had
been
flying
for
years.
he
flew
every
sunday.
he
went
out
the
next
day
and
was
killed
in
his
plane.
before
there
ever
had
been
a
medical
examination,
a
check
has
been
given
to
the
first
premium
and
that
check
after
being
held
for
sometime
pending
an
examination
by
some
other
attorneys
was
never
cashed
and
was
returned
to
the
applicant,
to
his
widow.
and
a
suit
was
brought
on
the
theory
that
there
is,
on
two
first
count
was
that
the
receipt
in
itself
was
a
temporary
contract
of
insurance
and
the
second
was
that
if
there
was
any
requirement
for
a
medical
examination
that
has
been
waived
or
excused
by
the
company.
now
just
a
word
about
a
conditional
receipt,
the
great
cry
is
that
a
conditional
receipt
is
an
engine
of
fraud
because
it
lures
a
man
into
thinking
he
has
been
insured
when
he
hasn't
been.
there
are
several
kinds
of
conditional
receipts.
there
is
an
exhaustive
note
in
2alr
second
which
is
referred
to
in
the
circuit
court's
appeals
opinion
in
which
they
list
various
categories
of
conditional
receipts.
some
of
them
are
conditioned
upon
the
approval
of
application
at
the
home
office
of
the
company.
some
are
conditioned
upon
the
issuance
of
the
policy
or
delivery
the
policy
and
some
of
them
as
this
one
condition
upon
the
insurability
of
the
applicant
and
judge
hand
in
the
(inaudible)
case
referred
to
that
form
a
receipt
as
being
a
more
favorable
to
the
applicant
than
any
other.
now
what
does
the
applicant
get?
assuming
that
the
applicant
passes
his
medical
examination
and
there
is
no
other
outside
evidence
with
regards
to
his
habits,
occupations,
the
family
history
and
so
forth,
the
(inaudible)
uninsurable.
the
--
he
is
covered
from
that
date
regardless
of
whether
his
death
occurs
before
the
application
reaches
the
home
office
of
the
company
or
before
a
policy
is
issued,
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
here
and
the
point
that
is
made
in
the
cases
where
there
have
recovery,
is
that
this
conditional
receipt
is
meant
to
protect
an
insurable
applicant
and
not
an
applicant
who
is
uninsurable.
now
the
testimony
here
was
that
this
man
was
not
insurable
for
the
plan
and
rate
applied
for.
to
go
back
again
to
explain
a
little
bit
more
about
it,
because
that's
was
when
--
this
is
what
is
called
an
increasing
term
policy,
and
it
starts
out
at
$10,500
which
is
a
small
unit
issued,
and
then
the
amount
is
reduced
$500
a
year
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
protect
people
who
are
--
have
mortgages
on
their
homes,
on
which
they
are
paying
an
installment
payment
so
that
as
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
goes
down,
the
amount
of
the
insurance
goes
down,
but
in
any
event
the
insurance
protects
the
man
from
his
decreasing
death.
then
there
is
in
the
record
a
showing
that
if
a
man
says
that
he
is
engaged
in
aviation,
they
give
him
what
is
called
an
aviation
questionnaire
in
which
he
recites
whether
he
owns
a
plane
or
whether
he
is
a
pilot,
how
many
hours
he
has
flown
and
so
forth,
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
that
aviation
questionnaire
as
shown
in
the
record
on
page
43
is
a
notice
to
the
agent
asking
him
if
the
insured
wants
to
be
covered
with
an
aviation
limitation,
that
is
to
say
that
if
the
insured
is
killed
while
flying
as
a
pilot,
the
premium
will
be
returned,
or
the
(inaudible)
or
wants
to
pay
an
extra
premium,
which
in
this
case
it
would
have
been
$3.75
a
thousand
and
he
is
given
the
opportunity
to
do
that
and
if
he
wants
to
pay
the
aviation
--
if
he
wants
to
have
the
aviation
exclusion
cause,
he
has
had
it
right
down
there,
a
writer
to
his
policy
which
appears
in
the
record
on
page
44,
which
he
signs
and
which
agrees
that
if
he
is
killed,
while
acting
a
pilot,
or
officer
or
member
of
the
crew,
the
company's
liability
is
limited.
now
the
agent
testified
that
this
man
said
no.
the
petitioner
claims
that
this
answer
no
was
written
in
by
the
agent
after
he
left.
well,
now
the
agent
swore,
definitely
you
could
say
so,
a
woman
was
there,
who
was
a
clerk
around
there
and
she
said
that
she
was
there,
but
she
didn't
pay
any
particular
attention
until
they
called
up
the
doctor
on
the
telephone.
the
insurer
says
over
his
signature
which
contains
his
answers,
the
foregoing
information
is
true
and
complete
and
is
correctly
recorded.
now
if
he
had
told
the
agent
that
he
was
a
flier,
that
would
have
been
--
he
would
have
been
given
the
opportunity
to
either
sign
the
aviation
amendment
or
to
pay
an
extra
premium,
as
he
didn't
of
course
nothing
was
known
about
that,
but
the
record
shows
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
an
investigation
is
made
for
the
retail
credit
company
and
as
everybody
in
the
office
says
that
they
knew
he
was
a
pilot
and
that
would
have
undoubtedly
been
disclosed
and
there
again
he
would
have
been
given
the
opportunity
to
have
the
aviation
exclusion
clause
or
the
--
pay
the
extra
premium,
but
the
policy
would
not
have
been
issued
as
applied.
he
was
not
insurable
for
the
plan
rating
applied
for.
he
was
eligible
for
insurance
and
mr.
forrest
says
that
the
agent
--
that
the
agency
vice
--
the
underwriting
vice
president
of
the
company
said
that
he
was
insurable.
he
said
and
i'm
sorry
to
say
there
is
a
slight
(inaudible)
where
he
is
quoted
in
the
brief
on
page
12,
the
word
any
appears
as
in
by
the
bench,
but
this
is
what
he
said,
"if
mr.
hinkle's
aviation
record
had
been
disclosed
in
the
aviation
questionnaire,
a
policy
would
not
have
issued
(inaudible)
extra
rating
or
without
the
limit
of
the
aviation
coverage.
if
a
man
owns
an
airplane
and
answers
the
questions
regarding
aviation
any
further,
he
would
be
eligible
for
every
plan
of
insurance
we
have,
with
either
an
aviation
exclusion
clause
or
an
extra
premium."
now
that's
all
that
was
done.
now
it's
so
happens
that
one
of
the
leading
cases
on
conditional
receipt
is
reynolds
case
in
our
(inaudible)
and
i
will
remind
your
honors,
what
was
suggested
by
the
judge
whitaker
that
in
three,
not
the
two
recent
cases,
not
too
old
cases,
ragan
against
merchants
transfer
&
warehouse
company,
helvering
against
stuart,
spiegel
estate
against
commissioner
who
say
that
ordinarily
you
will
accept
the
opinion
of
a
local
judge
and
the
local
law
and
judge
van
oosterhout
has
shown
by
who
is
who
practiced
law,
was
in
the
iowa
bar
for
30
years
and
sat
for
11
years
on
the
district
bench
in
iowa,
which
is
our
in
court.
now
the
reynold's
case
is
a
case
against
northwestern
mutual,
where
the
receipt
was
conditional
upon
insurability.
the
man
passed
his
medical
examination
and
then
died
the
next
day
and
the
company
said
that
he
wasn't
insurable
because
the
proof
of
death
showed
some
previous
heart
trouble.
now
exactly
the
same
claim
was
made
in
that
case
that
is
made
in
this,
that
when
the
receipt
was
given
he
was
granted
temporary
insurance
subject
to
be
discontinued
upon
the
rejection
of
the
application
on
the
ground
of
his
non-insurability.
and
the
iowa
court
held
that
the
insurability
of
the
applicant
on
the
date
of
the
medical
examination
is
by
the
contract
made
the
test
of
a
company's
liability.
now
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
says
--
said
just
what
he
is
saying
here,
that
the
insurance
becoming
effective
upon
the
date
of
the
medical
examination,
now
that
was
date
of
the
medical
examination,
here
it's
the
date
of
the
application,
but
there
is
no
difference
between
those
two,
it
is
the
prior
case,
and
they
are
both
of
course
(inaudible).
he
contended
the
insurance
becoming
effective
upon
the
date
of
the
medical
examination
continues
in
full
force,
until
the
application
is
rejected
by
the
company.
that
contention
was
denied
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
if
the
insurance
did
become
effective,
it
became
effective
at
the
past
date
of
the
medical
examination
because
that's
what
the
receipt
said,
but
that's
what
they
didn't
say;
that,
that
was
against
the
public
policy
of
iowa,
and
there
is
not
a
word
(inaudible)
about
public
policy.
they
said
that
the
contract
contemplates
that
the
liability
will
attach
before
the
issuance
of
a
policy,
but
they
said
that
as
he
was
not
insurable
on
the
date
of
the
medical
examination,
although
he
had
passed
it,
the
company
was
not
liable.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
he
had
a
previous
history
of
heart
trouble
which
he
had
denied
in
the
application
and
which
appeared
from
the
proofs
of
death.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
no
sir,
because
of
his
past
medical
history.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
no
sir,
they
have
(inaudible)
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
well
i
mean
if
--
it's
not
(inaudible),
he
might
have
got
one
with
a
rating
for
bad
health,
a
rate
up
policy,
what
they
call
a
substandard
policy
that
didn't
appear,
but
they
found
that
he
was
not
insurable
because
of
his
past
record
of
heart
trouble
and
several
serious
heart
attacks.
now
this
reynold's
case
is
the
law
of
iowa.
counsel
takes
two
extraordinary
positions
here.
he
says
that
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
because
it
didn't
follow
the
iowa
law,
under
the
erie
case
and
then
he
says
that
the
erie
case
will
throw
that
up
now
and
make
a
uniform
federal
rule
of
that
would
be
applied
to
all
of
these
cases
and
not
follow
the
law
of
the
state.
this
is
obviously
since
erie
railway,
a
decision
to
be
governed
by
the
law
of
iowa.
the
law
of
iowa
was
laid
down
by
the
reynold's
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
after
signing
that
case
wound
up
with
the
one
paragraph
that
summed
up
the
whole
thing,
the
insurance
was
not
in
effect
for
reason
that
the
applicant
did
not
and
could
not
meet
the
insurability
conditions
set
out
in
the
conditional
receipt,
because
of
his
aviation
pursuits.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
yes
sir.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
not
in
the
view
of
the
court.
now
perhaps
i
apologize
to
the
court,
i
should
have
gone
on
to
say
what
was
left
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
it
was
left
to
the
jury
on
question
(inaudible).
the
court,
the
lower
court
picked
out
the
receipt
the
first
proviso,
which
was
that
he
shall
be
in
good
health.
he
ignored
the
second
proviso
entirely
and
he
instructed
a
jury,
that
there
was
only
one
question
in
the
case
and
that
was
whether
the
insured,
the
applicant
was
in
good
health
on
the
date
of
the
application.
now
there
was
no
illness
in
the
record
whatever
about
this
good
health,
except
for
the
fact
that
he
had
passed
an
examination
of
a
pilot's
license
about
months
before
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
what
the
qualifications
for
that
were.
but
in
view
of
his
view
and
the
view
of
the
view
of
the
circuit
court
tool,
it
didn't
make
any
particular
difference
whether
he
lied
about
his
aviation
record
or
didn't
lie
or
whether
he
--
the
fact
was
that,
that
would
have
been
discovered
by
the
--
as
you
can
see,
that
would
have
been
discovered
by
the
investigation
and
whether
or
not
he
told
the
truth
or
didn't
tell
the
truth
was
really
immaterial.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
because
as
i
say,
in
the
view
that
both
the
trial
court
and
the
lower
court
made,
it
make
any
difference.
i
mean
if
we
grant
that,
it
didn't
make
a
difference
whether
the
applicant
told
the
truth
or
didn't
tell
the
truth
or
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
the
applicant
wrote
the
--
signed
the
application
after
the
answer
was
there
or
before
it
was
there.
now
the
only
evidence
to
this,
the
only
evidence
on
the
book
was
the
direct
testimony
of
the
agent
and
the
testimony
of
a
woman
clerk
who
was
there,
and
said
that
she
didn't
hear
him
ask
hinkle,
any
aviation
questions,
but
she
was
busy
about
her
own
work,
and
did
not
pay
any
particular
attention
to
the
conversation,
until
she
heard
the
agent
call
on
the
telephone
to
make
the
appointment
with
the
doctor.
now
that
is
the
only
contradictory
evidence
on
the
point,
but
i
think
in
view
--
i
think
that
the
point
is
immaterial
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
was,
because
of
his
aviation
activity,
uninsured.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
that's
right
sir.
but
we
are
not
--
if
the
policy
had
been
issued,
and
then
it
had
been
later
discovered
that
insured
was
a
pilot
and
the
company
had
brought
the
suit
to
cancel
the
policy
for
misrepresentation
or
if
the
insured
had
then
died,
it
might
have
been
a
very,
very
important
point
then
to
determine,
whether
this
policy
was
obtained
by
fraud,
and
of
course
if
they
didn't
write
in
the
application,
it
was
written
in
by
the
agent,
after
he
signed
it,
or
then
it
wasn't
obtained
by
fraud,
that
might
have
been
very
important,
but
that
is
not
so
important
here,
in
view
of
the
fact
of
his
non-insurability.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
didn't
matter
whether
there
had
been
--
if
your
honor
please,
suppose
there
had
been
no
question
at
that
time.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
and
suppose
that
then,
the
inspection
report
had
disclosed
that
he
was
a
pilot
and
owned
his
own
plane,
and
the
company
had
then
refused
to
issue
the
policy,
that
would
have
been,
because
he
was
uninsurable
regardless
of
whether
he
said
he
said
he
was
pilot
or
not
a
pilot.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
and
we
say
that
he
was
not
--
and
we
would
have
said
he
was
non-insurable.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
your
honor
please,
whether
it
was
the
fact,
not
a
misrepresentation
as
to
the
fact.
suppose
that
he
said
nothing
in
the
application
about
his
habits
discovered
that
he
was
an
alcoholic,
that
no
misrepresentation
about
his
alcoholism
in
his
application.
the
company
would
have
had
a
perfect
right
refuse
to
issue
a
policy
because
he
was
an
alcoholic,
even
though
he
hadn't
said
a
word
about
his
being
not
an
alcoholic
or
quite
(inaudible).
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
yes
sir.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
the
condition
was
in
the
receipt.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
yes
sir.
the
insured's
life
shall
be
in
full
force
and
effect
from
this
day,
provided
the
insured
is
not
in
good
health,
notwithstanding
any
changes
and
provided
that
satisfactory
evidence
of
the
(inaudible)
is
not
insurable
to
the
amount,
plan,
rate
(inaudible).
now
it
would
have
received
evidence
that
he
was
a
pilot
in
the
normal
course
of
events
and
would
therefore
have
failed
to
insure.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
now
i
call
your
attention
to
that
and
i
call
your
attention
to
where
it
occurs.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
it
occurs
under
the
amount,
now
the
testimony
was
that
the
agent
explained
to
hinkle
that
this
policy
started
at
$10,500
and
then
it
went
down
$500
a
year.
now
the
only
place,
the
only
way
the
amount
of
the
insurance
can
be
put
on
the
print
blank
is
by
putting
in
the
amount
and
he
said
he
wanted
to
make
it
crystal
clear
to
mr.
hinkle
that
he
wasn't
(inaudible)
policy
for
$10,500
it
was
a
reducing
term
policy.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
no
sir.
the
immediate
coverage
as
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
immediate
coverage
added
nothing
to
receipt
because
if
the
receipt
was
a
contract
of
temporary
insurance,
it
took
effect
immediately
anyhow.
and
if
it
was
a
conditional
receipt,
conditional
upon
the
other
thing,
then
the
coverage
was
purely
explanatory,
but
as
is
i
said
to
your
honor
--
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
well
you
might
say
this
is
rather
an
unusual
type
of
policy
because
when
you
pick
out
$1,000
of
insurance,
you
think
that
yourself
is
having
taken
out
$1,000
of
insurance.
but
because
of
the
fact
that
this
amount
was
reduced
every
year,
he
said,
this
is
his
testimony,
i
made
it
a
point
of
making
it
crystal
clear
to
mr.
hinkle,
that
this
was
decreasing
term
insurance,
that
this
$10,500
was
not
a
permanent
situation
and
as
i
have
explained
to
the
court
and
jury
it
decreases
each
year,
that
is
the
reason
why
i
wrote
i
the
receipt,
i
put
it
back
in,
so
that
there
would
be
no
misunderstanding
at
all
on
part
of
mr.
mr.
hinkle.
i
told
mr.
hinkle
why
i
put
that
in,
i
wrote
it
out
there,
so
there
is
no
possible
chance
of
any
misunderstanding.
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
well,
i
will
say
it
to
your
honor
that
i
don't
think
the
words
add
anything.
i
will
say
that
if
i
had
written
that
receipt,
i
would
said
initial
coverage
rather
than
immediate
coverage,
because
i
think
that
makes
it
a
little
clear.
but
if
the
receipt
was
either
a
binding
receipt,
which
gave
him
temporary
insurance
(inaudible)
or
it
was
a
conditional
receipt
which
didn't
take
effect
unless
the
provisos
were
complied
with.
but
if
it
did
take
effect,
because
the
provisos
were
(inaudible)
it
took
effect
from
its
date
which
was
immediate
coverage.
so,
that
adding
the
words
immediate
coverage
didn't
add
a
thing
to
it.
now,
if
he
had
meant
to
say
that
he
had
attempted
to
write
a
binding
receipt,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
his
putting
that
right
under
that
amount
on
the
top
(inaudible)
provisos.
he
didn't
think
he
was
changing
the
terms
of
the
receipt,
he
thought
he
(inaudible)
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
i
say
that.
yes
sir,
i
say
that,
that
is
the
answer
--
mr.
phineas
m.
henry
i
say
its
answered
by
the
(inaudible)
and
as
to
the
immediate
coverage,
that
of
course
was
not
covered
and
the
district
court,
said
that,
that
adding
nothing
to
the
receipt
and
that
he
submitted
to
the
jury
on
that
point.
now,
just
for
the
sake
of
the
record,
i
want
to
say
that
the
words,
that
mean
to
the
instruction,
but
they
were
not
preserved
because
we
thought
we
were
entitled
for
a
directed
verdict
under
these
decisions
in
the
reynolds
case.
now
i
have
been
--
there
are
several
other
things
i
mentioned
--
my
time
is
about
up
but
there
are
several
constitutional
questions
raised,
i
don't
know
--
of
course
what
the
members
of
the
court
had
in
mind
in
planning
the
writ.
i
can't
believe
that
they
are
very
important.
he
talks
about
being
prior
to
the
writ,
filed
by
jury
under
the
seventh
amendment
and
he
raises
the
question
if
the
federal
court
ever
had
any
jurisdiction
at
all,
although
it
was
stipulated
that
they
did,
and
i
don't
know
how
it's
worthwhile
wasting
any
of
my
short
time
on
those
points.
but
there
were
300
questions
raised
in
the
motion
for
directed
verdict
and
under
our
rule
in
iowa
if
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
is
based
on
with
say
foreground
and
the
district
court
chooses
to
pick
out
one
of
them
and
say
i
will
sustain
it
on
number
one,
and
i'll
overrule
two,
three
and
four
then
i
come
to
an
appellate
court
even
though
the
appellate
court
may
not
agree
with
him
on
number
one,
if
either
two,
three
or
four
were
good,
the
motion
is
upheld.
now
we
raised
the
additional
points
which
the
court
specifically
did
not
pass
on.
but
we
said
that
this
was
a
--
this
was
issued
in
connection
with
an
application.
it
ought
to
be
read
with
the
application.
but
the
application
was
never
completed
by
a
medical
examination
and
there
was
--
never
came
to
the
home
office
of
the
company
and
therefore
under
the
general
contract
law,
the
meeting
reminds
that
there
never
was
a
complete
identification
upon
which
the
(inaudible)
could
meet.
we
said
that
this
question
of
immediate
coverage
was
explained
by
the
testimony
but
if
it
was
thought
to
vary
the
terms
in
the
receipt
we
put
it
that
the
agent
had
no
authority
to
bind
the
company
to
a
contract
of
insurance
because
of
limitations
of
his
authority.
and
the
circuit
of
appeals
referred
to
that
as
a
serious
of
question
of
law
which
we
will
not
consider.
and
fourth
we
refer
to
an
iowa
statute
which
says
that
no
contract
of
insurance
shall
be
issued
in
iowa
in
excess
of
$10,000
without
a
medical
examination.
and
we
say
that
the
applicant
was
bound
to
know
that
and
without
a
medical
examination
this
company
couldn't
meet
a
contract
of
insurance
and
the
court
of
appeals
again
said
that
that
was
a
serious
question.
now
then
as
to
the
two
cases
in
the
gaunt
case
and
the
liberty
and
national
case
against
jones
in
tennessee,
the
liberty
national
case
receipt,
instead
of
saying
insurance
applied
for
said
in
the
receipt
itself
it
two
places,
and
this
is
underlying
the
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
insurance
granted
here
under
making
the
receipt
itself
a
contract
of
insurance,
the
insurance
granted
here
under,
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
a
binding
receipt.
the
--
judge
hand
in
the
gaunt
case
held
under
the
law
of
the
connecticut
where
he
could
not
find
any
law
but
on
the
general
law
that
he
felt
the
contract
was
ambiguous.
no
plea
of
that
ambiguity
was
made
in
this
case,
and
the
court
held
that
we
think
the
iowa
court
would
not
find
the
contract
ambiguous.
but
there
are,
we
submit
the
case,
that
the
(inaudible)
case
which
my
opponent
referred
to,
the
fire
insurance
case,
the
powers
of
fire
insurance
agents
and
life
insurance
agents
are
entirely
different.
you
ensure
your
house
against
fire,
you
want
to
(inaudible)
so
your
house
doesn't
burn
down
at
night,
that
night
and
general
agents
and
agents
of
insurance
of
fire
and
causality
companies
are
authorized
to
bind
their
companies
by
--
i
will,
i
think
your
honors
will
find
that
the
--
we'll
know
that
a
life
insurance
company
does
not
consider
its
underwriters,
as
its
agents
as
underwriters.
its
applications
have
to
be
approved,
and
its
home
office
after
being
gone
over
by
it's
underwriting
department,
and
i
think
your
honors
will
fail
to
find
a
case,
my
research
and
research
of
my
opponent
has
to
failed
to
find
it
where
they
said
that
a
man
was
insured
one
of
these
conditional
receipts,
when
the
conditions
had
not
been
complied
with
and
the
insured
was
not
insurable.
in
both
the
gaunt
case
and
the
liberty
national
case,
the
court
found
that
each
one
of
those
men
was
insured,
and
to
link
with
the
liberty
national
case
they
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
they
had
refused
a
liability
under
similar
contract
which
came
up
from
michigan
because
they
were
bound
by
the
law
of
michigan,
but
they
found
no
law
in
tennessee
and
they
held
that,
that
contract
which
was
a
much
broader
contract
than
this,
did
create
a
binding
contract
of
insurance.
