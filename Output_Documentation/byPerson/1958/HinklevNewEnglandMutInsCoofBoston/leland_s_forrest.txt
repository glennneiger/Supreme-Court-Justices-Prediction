mr.
leland
s.
forrest
mr.
chief
justice
–
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
--
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
an
action
of
law
commenced
in
an
iowa
state
court
upon
what
is
commonly
denominated
an
interim
contract
of
interim
insurance.
it
appears
at
page
17
of
the
record,
that
is
a
photostatic
copy
of
what
was
delivered
by
the
defendant
insurance
company
to
max
w.
hinkle.
the
unfortunate
thing
happened
that
he
took
out
this
insurance
and
paid
the
first
premium
on
a
friday
morning,
the
25th
february
and
the
next
day
he
was
killed
by
the
crashing
of
his
airplane.
our
contention
is
that
this
was
a
binding
contract
of
insurance.
that
all
the
conditions
occurred,
that
the
matter
of
doing
business
here
by
this
matter,
they
induced
him
or
led
him
to
believe
that
he
was
insured
when
he
paid
this
premium
and
that
under
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
it
is
against
the
public
policy
of
iowa
or
any
court,
either
the
iowa
courts
or
any
other
court
to
assist
an
insurance
company
from
evading
that
liability
when
they
--
iowa
has
said
that
by
the
--
the
fact
that
they
are
charging
him
a
premium
over
that
interm,
that
if
they
don't
have
to
pay
it
is
unpaid.
now
our
chief
complaint
against
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
they
decided
this
case
by
numerous
decisions
other
than
from
iowa.
they
did
mention
and
cite
the
reynolds
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
i
have
cited
it
to
that.
they
stated
what
the
court
said
in
that
case,
then
they
took
a
large
number
of
cases,
mostly
cases
from
states
where
the
fact
i'm
going
to
call
your
attention
to,
the
most
essential
fact
did
not
exist
and
then
said
by
interpreting
this
iowa
case,
in
the
light
of
this
--
these
other
cases
that
there
should
have
been
a
verdict
directed
for
the
insurance
company.
so
the
real
question
in
the
case,
it's
not
a
case
of
who
should
recover
and
who
shouldn't,
it's
a
case
of
whether
or
not
the
court
should
have
directed
a
verdict
for
the
insurance
company.
the
trial
court
overruled
the
motion
of
the
defendants
for
directed
verdict,
submitted
to
the
jury
and
under
his
instructions
the
jury
found
for
the
plaintiffs.
now
it's
immaterial,
nobody
took
any
exceptions
to
these
instructions,
i
didn't
and
they
didn't.
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
that
is
where
i
made
my
mistake
in
the
oral
argument
and
of
course
that
did
create
i
think
considerable
prejudice
in
the
part
of
the
iowa
judge
against
the
man
from
the
missouri
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
claim
it
wasn't
due
process
of
law,
because
then
when
you
emphasis
the
fact
where
the
judge
came
from,
then
you
haven't
got
due
process
of
law,
but
(inaudible)
prejudice.
and
i
might
say
however
that
the
gentlemen,
if
you
gentlemen
set
up
there
from
kansas
city,
you
probably
know
him
better
than
i
do,
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
men
and
you
didn't
have
to
hit
him
over
the
head
with
the
case
to
get
him
to
see
it,
he
was
usually
two
jumps
ahead
of
you.
and
my
contention
is
that
don't
make
any
difference
where
the
judge
came
from,
there
isn't
any
judge
in
iowa
that
would
have
sustained
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
in
this
case.
now
if
you
look
at
that,
in
the
first
place
they
have
written
in
there
the
word
immediate
coverage
in
ink
in
addition
to
what
they
printed,
and
here
is
what
they
printed,
the
insurance
applied
for
shall
be
in
full
force
and
effect
from
this
date,
provided
the
proposed
insured
is
now
in
good
health,
notwithstanding
any
change
of
the
proposed
insured's
health
or
condition
due
to
disease
hereafter
acquired
or
to
any
subsequent
causality.
now
by
the
time
the
average
man
and
i'm
going
to
refer
to
the
judge
hand's
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
obviously,
by
the
time
the
average
man
reads
through
the
sentence
the
rest
of
it
is
he
is
confused.
it
took
the
court
--
judge
(inaudible),
it
took
him
20
some
pages
with
briefs
and
weighted
authority
to
convince
himself
that
this
meant
what
he
said
would
be.
now
if
you
refer
to
judge
hand's
opinion,
he
says
in
the
second
circuit,
that
these
things
are
to
be
interpreted
not
like
an
insurance
adjuster,
an
insurance
underwriter
would
interpret
it,
that
it
be
interpreted
the
way
the
average
man
would
interpret.
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
no,
but
he
didn't
do
this
which
the
court
of
appeals
did.
he
doesn't
write
his
knowledge
of
insurance
business
into
the
opinions
and
make
an
expert
witness
out
of
himself
subconsciously.
now
that's
what
he
was
saying
i
think,
that
no
judge,
no
matter
how
much
he
knows
about
insurance,
should
not
write
his
knowledge
of
the
insurance
business
into
a
contract
and
thereby
read
his
knowledge
in
there
as
if
he
were
an
expert
witness,
and
that's
what
i
claim,
the
court
of
appeal's
statement.
they
took
review
of
that
--
they
took
their
knowledge
of
a
--
of
the
insurance
underwriter
and
they
said
this
conclusively
shows
that
he
wasn't
insurable,
but
the
only
way
they
could
do
it
under
not
here,
but
they
didn't
say
it
was
insurable,
but
not
insurable
under
the
underwriting
rules
and
practices
of
the
company.
now
they
did
put
in
evidence
some
of
their
underwriting
rules
and
practices,
now
that
was
over
by
objection.
now
here
is
what
is
actually
happened.
they
introduced
parole
evidence
over
my
objection
to
vary
the
terms
of
this
contract
and
your
judge,
he
knew
his
evidence
law,
because
i
objected
that
it
was
varying
the
pro
tanto.
he
says
i'll
let
it
in
but
i
can
take
care
of
it
on
the
instructions
which
is
just
another
way
of
saying
the
parole
evidence
rule
is
rule
of
substantive
law,
so
what
difference
does
it
make
(inaudible),
as
long
as
i
take
it
out
from
the
(inaudible),
and
that's
the
only
evidence
a
judge
take
out,
and
my
understanding
(inaudible)
and
tell
the
jury
not
to
consider
it
is
what
violate
the
parole
evidence
rule
because
parole
evidence
rule
(inaudible).
now
words
of
this
can't
goose
out
of
a
turkey
but
from
goose
–
turkey
to
goose
and
now
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
most
important
iowa
decision.
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
case
you
mentioned,
because
i
assumed
as
you
hinted
i
should
assume
that
the
iowa
judge
knew
the
iowa
law.
now
i
don't
dispute
he
does,
he
knows
it,
but
he
knows
it
the
way
he
thinks
it
ought
to
be,
he
doesn't
know
it
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
says
it
is,
and
here
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
said,
and
this
is
the
case
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
read,
of
course
i
asked
him
to
read
it,
and
they
wrote
in
the
opinion
and
said
it's
unnecessary
to
pass
on
that
question
because
we
hold
that
the
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
the
agent
had
the
authority
or
not.
now
he
was
about
to
say
it
and
i
read
it
for
two
reasons,
one
because
i
think
under
your
erie
rule
the
court
of
appeals
was
bound
by
it
and
the
second
it's
effect
duration
of
the
policy
of
iowa,
as
to
what
is
good
public
policy
and
whenever
the
court
of
iowa
says
that
the
thing
is
not
good
public
policy
then
if
an
iowa
court
goes
in
to
defeat
that
public
policy,
it
isn't
just
right.
now
let
me
read
what
it
says,
this
is
a
quote,
"where
the
policy
covers
the
risk
from
the
date
of
the
application."
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
this
is
from
the
(inaudible)
case
cited
in
my
brief,
(inaudible)
against
the
fire
insurance
company.
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
well
i
wrote
is
here
in
typewriting
i
can't
give
the
exact
page,
but
the
case,
is
a
199
iowa,
i
think
--
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
it's
in
my
brief
and
i
haven't
proffered
this
in
the
brief,
but
i
want
to
read
it
because
for
the
very
thing
that
they
said,
they
presumed
that
this
iowa
judge
knows
the
iowa
law
and
i'm
sure
he
does,
but
he
doesn't
know
it
the
same
way
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
knows.
it
is
apparent
that
the
insured
pays
for
insurance
for
the
stipulated
period
beginning
with
the
application,
not
the
date
of
its
acceptance.
no
one
would
be
expected
to
take
out
insurance
for
a
period
of
time
that
had
already
lapsed,
but
unless
there
is
a
preliminary
contract
of
insurance
covering
the
time
between
the
making
of
the
application
and
its
acceptance
or
rejection,
that
is
what
every
insured
who
received
such
a
policy
is
required
to
do,
but
just
the
injustice
of
saying
that
on
the
acceptance
of
the
application,
the
insured
has
had
protection
from
the
prior
date
where
no
loss
occurs,
where
it
is
also
said,
that
there
is
--
and
that
he
is
not
protected,
if
a
loss
did
occur,
is
plain.
in
other
words,
they
declared
the
public
policy
of
iowa
that
if
they
are
collecting
a
premium,
that
is
going
to
date
the
policy
prior,
back
to
the
application
then
if
he,
when
he
dies
--
when
he
gets
insurance
of
course
sure
he
wasn't
insured,
or
if
he
is
still
alive,
then
they
charge
him
and
begin
to
collect
the
premium
as
the
date
of
his
application,
not
the
date
of
his
policy.
so
iowa
says
there's
scheme
for
doing
it.
the
injustice
of
it
is
plain.
now
when
i,
my
contention
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
declares
a
public
policy
of
iowa
of
what
is
an
injustice
and
then
some,
if
he
is
not
a
judge
that
sits
on
the
federal
court,
when
he
sits
on
the
bench
and
you
just
hit
the
decision
as
a
federal
judge
to
produce
the
very
injustice
that
the
iowa
court
has
denounced
it
against
its
public
policy,
he
is
certainly
not
following
the
erie
rule.
i
think
erie
rule
as
i
understand
it
they
are
supposed
to
get
the
same
results
that
an
iowa
would
get.
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
no
i
don't
--
it
depends
on
how
they
worded
their
application
and
their
policy,
but
their
idea
here
was
that
well
i
mean
read
their
own
evidence,
he
says
in
here
that
i
am
a
state
director,
so
i
am
naturally
state
of
(inaudible)
wherever
it
comes.
turn
over
on
next
page
to
page
20
is
the
fact
of
this
application
and
that
is
the
very
thing
--
it
was
on
the
application
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
if
the
premium
is
paid
on
the
date
the
application
is
signed
the
policy
will
usually
bear
that
date
it's
issued
as
applied
for.
in
other
words
they
told
him
right
there
and
they
told
the
agent,
we
are
going
to
date
this
policy,
the
date
of
the
application,
not
the
date
we
issue
the
policy.
now
i
didn't
discover
that,
i
didn't
know
it
was
there
i
have
to
try,
so
i
thought
that
i
have
to
prove
that
fact
by
cross
examination.
so
i
asked
the
vice
president
of
the
company
who
testified
in
his
evidence
i
think
is
on
page
47
on
that,
i
asked
him,
if
you
had
issued
a
policy
in
this
case
what
would
have
been
the
due
date
of
the
premium,
the
date
of
the
policy
or
the
date
of
the
application.
he
said
the
date
of
the
application,
and
i
asking
if
that
was
in
their
usual
practice.
and
he
said
no,
not
always
but
that
would
have
been
the
practice
in
this
case.
in
other
words
they
have
gotten
up
a
scheme
or
a
contract
which
if
you
read
the
defendant
opinion,
i
think
you
get,
it's
clear
in
(inaudible)
by
which
day
or
time
that
agent
sells,
in
the
competition
of
selling
insurance
where
they
wanted
induce
the
man
to
take
out
insurance
right
now
and
pay
the
premium
and
if
you
will,
they
will
make
his
insurance
effective
immediately
and
that's
what
they
tell
him.
now
after
they
tell
him
that
of
course
and
they
take
his
money,
then
they
hand
him
these
receipts
and
of
course
receipts
(inaudible)
court.
now
that
in
--
this
case
is
in
conflict
when
these
two
iowa
cases
that
i
have
cited
the
reynolds
case
and
this
(inaudible)
case.
now
let
me
explain
about
the
(inaudible)
case.
this
(inaudible)
case
was
a
fire
insurance
policy
and
the
argument
was
whether
or
not
the
agent
had
the
authority
to
make
that
effective
immediately
or
wait
until
he
delivered
the
files.
they
had
good
enough
evidence
in
that
case,
his
contract
with
the
insurance
company
which
said,
expressly
that
the
agent
did
not
have
that
authority.
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
says,
irrespective
of
what
you
put
in
there
if
--
and
they
said
this
what
i
quoted
here,
if
they
are
charging
a
premium
over
that
time
or
fixing
it
so
when
they
issued
the
policy
they
have
the
authority
to
charge
a
premium
over
that
time
then
the
--
and
because
of
the
injustice
of
such
a
situation
i
think
they
should
have
said
they
are
going
to
stop
to
deny
his
authority,
but
they
didn't
say
that,
they
went
farther
than
that.
they
said
he
had
apparent
authority.
now
if
he
had
apparent
authority
there
is
only
one
way
that
it
could
have
appeared
to
the
insured
that
he
had
authority
and
that
is
that
he
has
authority
to
tell
the
truth.
the
iowa
case
says
the
reason
he
had
apparent
authority
to
promise
immediate
coverage
is
because
the
charging
the
premium
under
the
iowa
law
there
was
as
immediate
coverage.
and
if
there's
immediate
coverage
the
reason,
he
ain't
got
apparent
authority
to
tell
the
truth
and
that's
i
think
what
that
case
means.
but
it
does
make
any
difference
in
every
case,
well
there
are
the
two
actually,
and
they're
--
that
is
they
don't
have
a
new
rules,
that
what
they
are
doing
is
saying
that
whenever
this
situation
arises,
there
--
a
mere
effect
that
they
are
charging
that
premium
means
as
a
manner
of
public
policy
in
iowa
whether
they
claim
to
have
no
authority
or
whatever
they
claim
they
are
lying.
and
i
think
you
could
even
say
that
they
have
a
case
actually
interprets
or
construes
that
collecting
that
premium
simply
impose
a
liability.
now
they
haven't
used
it
and
in
this,
insured
in
this
agency
case.
they
did
finish
up
and
said
we
do
not
mean
to
hold
here
necessarily,
that
we
are
imposing
our
liability,
but
they
didn't
say,
we
are
not
i
think
that
they
mean
next
time
don't
argue
about
authority,
come
up
here
and
claim
this
as
an
imposed
liability
and
we'll
hold
(inaudible).
but
anyhow
whatever
you
take
it,
in
every
case,
it's
a
declaration
of
the
public
policy
of
iowa
and
that's
(inaudible)
shall
we
give
a
signal
and
i
want
to
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
to
rebuttal.
don't
ever
you
forget
on
the
(inaudible)
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
will
(inaudible)
in
answer
to
this
thing
that
this
judge,
who
is
quoted
(inaudible)
who
is
who
is
--
knows
the
iowa
law
let
me
read
to
what
he
said.
i
know
he
knows
the
iowa
law,
because
here
it
is,
(inaudible)
now
he
turned
around
got
his
(inaudible).
he
says
here
we
believe
the
iowa
court
would
not
find
the
conditional
receipt
before
us
ambiguous.
well
if
it
wasn't
ambiguous
how
could
they
introduce
this
evidence
here
to
bury
the
terms
of
this
immediate
coverage?
if
immediate
coverage
doesn't
means
immediate
coverage
then
you
can't
introduce
the
evidence,
so
they
wanted
to
prove
it
was
ambiguous,
now
he
is
wrong
about
that,
it
is
ambiguous.
they
are
the
ones
who
claimed
(inaudible)
and
that
their
evidence
wasn't
admissible
to
bury
the
terms
because
it
wasn't
ambiguous.
now
in
the
printed
brief
they
claim
now
that
this
case
isn't
like
judge
hand's
(inaudible)
one
in
the
sixth
circuit
because
those
were
ambiguous
and
this
wasn't
and
i've
got
--
sure
to
explain
that
if
the
(inaudible)
see
it,
because
it
is
clearly
fallacy.
anyhow
he
said
that
i
believe
the
iowa
court
would
construe
this
contract
as
providing
insurance
from
the
date
of
this
receipt
subject
to
the
condition
that
if
the
insurer
rejects
the
application
in
good
faith
for
valid
reasons
and
upon
the
ground
that
the
applicant
is
not
insurable,
the
amount
(inaudible)
applied
for,
and
the
premium
is
returned,
no
liability
would
exist
if
that
occurs
before
notice
of
rejection.
now
that
is
what
the
reynolds
case
says,
then
he
goes
ahead
and
he
say
that
they
did
reject
it
and
that's
the
thing
i
complain
about,
in
the
two
iowa
cases
one
says
if
they
are
assigned
a
different
reason
before
they
--
even
if
they
had
rejected
it,
they
signed
some
other
reason
for
refusal
to
pay
before
they
rejected
it,
then
under
what
we
call
in
iowa
the
mending
this
whole
(inaudible)
doctrine
they
can't
mend
the
whole
and
go
and
reject
it
afterwards
and
the
evidence
in
their
own
pleading,
they
plead
that
they
notified
the
attorneys
for
this
woman
that
the
reason
they
wouldn't
pay
is
because
he
never
had
physical
examination
and
under
the
iowa
doctrine
amending
this
whole,
they
are
limited
to
that
defense
and
that's
the
reason
i
think
the
trial
judge
instructed
that
if
he
didn't
have
a
physical
examination
he
would
have
passed
it
if
he
is
in
good
health.
therefore
if
he
is
in
good
health,
it's
immaterial
whether
they
had
a
physical
examination
or
not
and
that's
what
the
american
law
institute
says
about
excusing
conditions.
that
if
the
condition
would
have
occurred,
if
it
had
gone
ahead
and
do
it,
the
fact
that
he
was
prevented
from
doing
it
by
death
or
they
prevented
it
from
doing
it
but
putting
it
off
to
monday,
and
if
he
was
in
good
health,
then
he
didn't
need
a
physical
examination,
and
that's
the
iowa
law,
and
i
cite
the
case
in
there
on
that.
now
fallacy
(inaudible)
is
in
applying
their
facts
they
think
or
they
go
ahead
and
show
that
they
did
reject
it,
but
here
is
where
they
rejected.
the
case
i
cite
says
it
has
to
be
rejected
by
the
committee
in
the
office
and
mr.
arnold
their
vice
president
testified
and
here
was
their
theory,
we
have
never
accepted
this
offer.
an
offer
can't
be
accepted
except
by
our
committee
that
passes
on
this,
and
we
do
not
take
the
doctor's
report
alone
and
then
to
corroborate
it
he
brought
in
a
mr.
mustard
who
is
the
head
agent
of
the
detective
agency
who
testified
that
he
had
(inaudible)
business
and
they
all
just
turned
it
over
to
detective
agency
and
that
no
man
is
insurable
until
the
detective
agency
gets
through
with
it
and
then
he
is
still
not
insurable
till
they
pass
on
and
in
this
colloquy
he
complains
about
with
the
judge,
the
judge
was
trying
to
help
him
out.
he
was
trying
to
say,
at
least
i
understood
it,
(inaudible)
if
you're
claiming
that
a
man
is
not
insurable
until
you
have
passed
on
his
insurability,
then
you
are
just
making
your
contract
void
because
you're
contradicting
the
first
term
and
that's
what
they
did
in
the
reynolds
case.
there
was
a
clause
in
the
reynolds
contract
says
and
provided
an
insurance
policy
is
issued
and
delivered
to
the
insured
or
to
his
representatives
and
the
iowa
court
took
that
out,
they
didn't
say
why,
but
it's
obvious.
it
contradicted
the
first
clause
and
the
iowa
law
is
that
a
contract
must
be
interpreted
(inaudible)
against
the
man
who
drew
it,
and
i
have
got
the
answer
to
this,
or
give
you
these
cases,
because
in
his
brief
he
says,
the
judge
hand's
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
says
the
local
law
wasn't
the
same,
and
i
want
to
show
you
that
the
local
law
in
iowa
was
exactly
what
judge
hand
said
the
law
is.
where
one
drafts
a
document,
uses
ambiguous
language
or
failure
to
admit
to
more
than
one
construction,
the
meaning
to
be
given
in
which
they
are
under
is
the
way
in
which
they
are
understood
by
the
other
party,
and
that's
minnesota
linseed
oil
co.
against
montague
&
smith,
65
iowa
67,
and
it
isn't
in
my
brief
and
i
believe
that
somebody
write
down
the
citation,
21
northwestern
141.
under
the
well
recognized
rule,
if
a
right
is
to
be
construed
against
the
author
of
it,
rather
than
in
his
favor,
now
that's
just
what
judge
hand
was
saying
when
he
said
--
he
read
the
way
that
other
party
understands;
central
northern
fire
insurance
company
against
omaha
life
company,
194
iowa
205,
189
northwest
723.
the
court
should
interpret
--
here
is
another
one,
the
court
should
interpret
a
contract
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
buy
and
entering
into
it,
and
then
it
goes
into
pricing,
that
the
interpretation,
if
they
want
to
put
on
it,
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
contract,
they
shouldn't
interpret
it,
so
as
to
defeat
it's
purpose.
now
his
whole
argument
there
was
the
insurability,
means
the
willingness
of
the
insurance
company
to
insure,
and
that
is
never
determined
according
to
him
until
the
insurance
company
sort
of
adopts
the
policy.
now
the
court
here
said
it
rejected.
that
the
only
time
they
ever
rejected
was
in
the
attorney's
office
when
they
prepared
the
answer.
they
did
plead
in
the
answer,
but
they
were
rejected,
but
the
iowa
is
too
long,
they
attorneys
after
they
are
sued
to
do
the
rejecting,
it's
the
board
of
directors
or
the
committee
that
passes
it
on
that
has
to
do
it
under
the
iowa
cases,
and
they
never
did
it.
so
he
has
got
his
facts
completely
wrong.
they
got
their
law,
and
i
just
quote
he
is
right,
but
they
got
the
facts
wrong.
now
there
is
one
question
they
didn't
--
they
said
that
it
was
a
serious
question,
it
wasn't
answered
and
that's
when
mr.
henry
just
raised,
i
want
to
give
you
the
iowa
case
that
will
answer
that.
the
iowa
court
has
never
construed
this
particular
statute
that
he
refers
to
which
is
in
the
chapter
on
the
regulation
of
insurance
companies,
and
it
does
say
the
commissioner
of
insurance
should
not
approve
the
contract
for
over
$10,000
that
doesn't
contemplate
a
physical
examination.
and
then
it
says
that
no
insurance
company
shall
issue
a
contract
that
doesn't
contemplate
or
it
doesn't
have
an
examination,
but
it
doesn't
say
it's
void.
now
that
is
analogous
to
the
same
old
thing
as
to
old,
than
in
the
days
when
corporations
were
prohibited
from
doing
business
in
iowa
unless
without
a
permit,
it's
the
same
thing,
they
were
told
not
to
do
it
and
they
went
and
did
it.
then
they
come
in
and
want
to
claim
the
benefit
of
their
own
wrong
and
say
we
did
wrong
in
issuing
this
policy,
but
we
want
the
court
to
hold
this
for
us,
because
we
are
wrong,
(inaudible)
on
that
night
here
is
where
i
made
a
mistake,
i
assumed
that
this
iowa
judge
knew
that,
but
apparently
he
didn't.
anyhow
the
iowa
cases,
there
are
plenty
of
them,
we
have
a
corporation,
takes
advantage
and
goes
and
does
something
that
the
statute
says
it
should
do,
that
can't
take
the
benefit
of
their
own
wrong,
i
think
that's
another
estoppel,
another
case
on
that
in
iowa
is
spinney
against
miller,
114
iowa
210
or
86
northwestern
317,
now
those
aren't
very
recent
cases,
but
i
got
them
out
in
a
hurry
and
i
think
the
earlier
they
are
the
more
(inaudible)
and
now
i
wanted
to
make
one
remark
about
the
logic
of
this
thing,
in
other
words
the
--
i
have
been
arguing
here
merely
on
the
policy
of
iowa,
that
he
said
that
this
man
was
not
insurable
for
the
amount
and
plan
and
rates
applied
for,
and
i
say
absolutely
if
you
follow
these
odd
rules
here,
if
you
interpret
the
contract
the
way
the
insurance
company
wants
to
interpret
it,
and
in
their
motion
for
directed
verdict,
they
didn't
say
he
wasn't,
they
said
he
isn't
according
to
our
underwriting
rules
and
practices,
well
the
contract
doesn't
say
he
has
to
be
insurable
according
to
our
underwriting
rules
and
practices,
then
to
bury
the
terms
of
this
contract,
they
brought
on
these
two
witnesses
to
prove
what
their
underwriting
words
and
practices
were.
now
if
they
have
to
prove
what
their
practices
are,
in
order
to
prove
that
these
details
didn't
happen,
well
that
is
certainly
a
question
for
the
jury,
whether
that
was
correct
about
the
underwriting
rules
and
practices.
but
even
with
that
end,
here
is
the
way
they
interpret
it
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
insured
when
it
says
satisfactory
evidence
of
insurability,
they
say
that
means
conclusive
proof,
now
that's
their
argument,
that
satisfactory
evidence
means
conclusive
proof.
now
i
don't
claim
that
he
could
send
in
conclusive
proof,
it
doesn't
say
he
had
to,
and
they
testify
also
that
what
they
meant
by
that
clause,
they
meant
the
medical
examination.
now
if
that
medical
examination
had
gone
in,
and
i
think
this
was
time
of
judge
(inaudible),
the
medical
examination
had
gone
in
and
he
was
of
good
health,
the
medical
examination
would
have
shown
it
and
if
the
medical
examination
showed
he
is
in
good
health
then
they
did
have
satisfactory
evidence
with
their
own
doctor
saying
that
he
had
satisfactory
evidence
that
he
was
insurable
and
the
testimony
is
that
even
with
these
airplane
activities
he
still
was
insurable
for
every
amount
they
had
--
well
i
did
use
the
word
eligible
but
i
don't
see
any
difference,
he
was
eligible
for
insurance
for
every
plan
they
had
and
for
every
amount
they
had,
but
they
said
it
will
cost
him
a
little
more
money.
now
they
want
to
define
this
word
rating,
and
i
think
judge,
the
judges
wrote
in
their
knowledge,
their
guess
as
to
what
it
really
means.
i
looked
at
the
dictionary
and
this
is
what
rating
says
to
me,
it
means
a
financial
standing
that
an
american
field
agency
assigns
to
a
man
and
then
there
is
other
definitions.
now
if
there
are
two
definitions
to
a
word
you
can
adopt
a
definition,
even
one
that
doesn't
exist,
assume
their
definition
exists,
you
can't
adopt
the
definition
that's
most
favorable
to
an
insurance
company.
you
got
to
adopt
a
definition
that
at
least
would
mean
to
the
average
man
and
if
the
dictionary
gives
two
definitions
certainly
a
court
can't
say
as
a
matter
of
law
which
definition
he
likes
the
best.
now
they
--
here
is
another
thing
to
show
due
process
of
the
law.
i
haven't
got
this
means
to
turn
up
the
history
and
the
pedigrees
of
the
judges,
but
he
tried
to
talk
about
in
his
brief,
the
(inaudible)
brief,
he
writes
up
a
glorious
statement
about
judge,
one
from
south
(inaudible)
and
he
says
in
there,
i
didn't
know
it,
maybe
it's
not
true
but
i
like
to
concede
that
it
is
that
for
years
he
was
commissioner
of
insurance
in
missouri
and
therefore
he
found
them
all
what
insurance
companies
think.
now
if
that's
true
he
should
qualify
his
expert
witnesses
during
the
trial,
not
try
to
qualify
him
on
a
(inaudible)
and
if
that
did
what
he
says
he
did
and
used
his
knowledge
as
commissioner
of
insurance,
minnesota
as
to
what
insurance
companies
think
he
should
have
let
me
cross
examine
him
because
all
he
is
doing
is
qualifying
here
as
an
expert
witness
and
i
don't
think
it's
due
process
of
law
for
an
appellate
court
to
substitute
himself
as
an
expert
witness
and
then
after
he
does
his
own
testifying
they
are
indirectly
by
putting
in
this
and
pass
on
the
truth
of
his
own
expert
testimony
and
that's
what
they
did
here.
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
no,
i
did
not,
i
didn't
know
anything
about
it
and
i
had
no
means
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
proper
for
them
to
bring
in
here
because
we
are
not
having
any
insurance
investigator.
we
can't
go
out
and
check
up
on
the
judges
to
make
any
points
in
their
arguments
and
to
me
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
judges
are.
i
assume
that
they
are
going
to
decide
according
to
the
law.
i
know
there
maybe
some
human
nature
of
the
commissioner
of
insurance,
they
are
trying
to
get
a
case
and
slanted
the
way
his
sympathies
are.
i
don't
know
what
the
sympathies
of
an
insurance
commissioner
are,
in
minnesota
i
know
what
they
are
in
iowa.
i
can
tell
you
this
(inaudible)
insurance
commissioner
unless
the
attorneys
for
the
insurance
companies
approved
them
and
sought
they
get
a
point.
if
i
tried
--
if
i
tried
to
be
commissioner
of
insurance,
especially
after
this
case
that
every
insurance
lawyer
overseeing
the
governor
(inaudible)
getting
the
point.
now,
well
that's
true
in
minnesota
--
not
that
i
don't
know.
but
another
great
many
things
and
of
course
i
am
obviously
excited
to
type
--
making
oral
argument
without
that
--
is
consistent
and
he
says
i
didn't
plea
the
(inaudible)
please
read
his
record,
he
pointed
it
and
i
didn't,
pages
21
to
43,
there
is
my
(inaudible),
please
read
and
please
read
my
written
argument
because
it's
got
more
kind
of
noise
into
it
than
my
oral.
and
then
there
is
also,
he
says,
that
he
doesn't
want
to
impose
on
your
patience
by
calling
attention
to
the
many
misstatements
of
the
record
and
when
he
says
that,
i
would
like
to
respectfully
ask
you
to
please
let
me
impose
upon
your
patience
to
please
read
it
and
see
if
i
did
mistake
right
because
i
think
as
i
am
entitled
to
that
when
he
insinuates
that
i
did.
please
read
the
record
carefully
and
please
protect
my
statements,
now
if
i
am
wrong
(inaudible)
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
yes.
mr.
leland
s.
forrest
well
i
wouldn't,
i
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
answer
except
this.
there
are
separate
chapters
in
our
code
on
fire
insurance
and
life
insurance
and
if
it
was
a
fire
insurance
case
it's
possible.
but
where
i
have
checked
the
code,
they
have
done
almost
identically
the
same
thing
in
each
chapter
especially
on
insurance
companies
that
is
where
it
would
be
applicable.
so
it
very
likely
has
the
same
thing,
but
there
are
two
chapters,
one
on
life
insurance,
one
on
fire
insurance
and
several
other
different
type
of
insurance
et
cetera.
but
they
are
very
likely
it
says
the
same
thing.
