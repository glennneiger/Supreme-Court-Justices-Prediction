how
about
those
words
--
i
was
going
to
say
how
about
those
words
like
immediate
coverage
that
appeared
in
there
apparently
in
the
handwriting
of
the
agent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
term
express
immediate
coverage,
does
that
express
that
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
not
a

to
put

immediate
coverage?
chief

but
do
you
think
that
those
words
convey
that
meaning?
