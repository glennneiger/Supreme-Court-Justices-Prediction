justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
lawyer
and
the
court
of
appeals
who
wrote
this
opinion
was
an
iowa
lawyer,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
henry
–
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
may
i
ask
you
sir,
you
referred
to
the
answer
on
--
to
question
17
on
the
application

would
it
make
a
difference
if
that
were
not
mr.
hinkle's
answer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
here
is
what
i
mean
to
get
to,
as
i
have
done
a
little
looking
at
this
record
and
there
was
some
evidence
that
this
answer
to
question
17
may
not
have
been
mr.
hinkle's
answer,
but
the
answer
written
in
by
the
agent.
was
there
enough
there,
to
make
an
issue
of
fact
for
a
jury
and
on
that
question
and
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
have
sent
the
case
back
for
a
retrial
before
a
jury
of
that
issue,
rather
than
to
have
simply
held
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
recover?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
representation
in
that
respect
although
absent
a
negative
answer
to
question
17.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
fact
of
his
non-insurability,
i'm
having
a
little
difficult
with
this,
was
not
bad
health,
it
was
merely
that
he
did
some
flying
and
in
the
answer
to
question
17
said
he
did
not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
as
in
this
case
when
he
died
the
next
day
by
an
accident.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
had
made
no
representations
though
in
the
assumption
we
make
now,
that
this
was
not
his
answer
to
question
17
that
did
not
fly.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
absence
of
some
such
representations
in
the
application,
are
absent
some
condition
excusing
liability
in
the
conditional
receipt,
the
company
would
be
liable
if
he
were
killed
the
next
day?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then
do
you
find
(inaudible)
–
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
receipt?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
know
that
judge
(inaudible)
at
one
time
was
british
commissioner?
