that
would
require
overruling
moore,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
thought
your
argument
was
maybe,
it's
right,
i'm
not
saying
it's
not
(inaudible)
i
understood
from
your
argument
that
any
suit
by
an
employee
requires
interpretation
of
congress
while
he
was
an
employee,
should
go
to
the
board
and
not
to
the
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
went
that
far,
it
would
say
that
the
man
who
has
been
wrongfully
discharged
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
get
your
idea.
we
proceeded
rather
warily
on
this
ground
as
you
feel,
as
you
know,
but
it
was
pretty
strongly
indicated
that
maybe
a
good
line
would
be
to
let
ex-employees
sue
after
they
have
left
the
railroad
on
the
basis,
on
the
rationale,
maybe
that
wouldn't
interfere
with
the
relationship
of
the
railroad
and
its
then
employee.
now
if,
as
you
argue,
that
is
a
bad
division,
what
would
you
suggest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
bring
moore,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
different
kind
of
suit
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
of
it's
more
in
the
nature
of
a
suit
for
malicious
interference
of
contract?
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
one,
under
your
definition,
under
what
you
want,
a
man
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
the
board
to
get
his
contract
interpreted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
longer
an
employee
and
someone
had
maliciously
brought
about
his
discharge
but
it
might
depend
in
part
on
the
bargaining
agreement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
moore
as
i
recall
it
there
was
more
than
that.
there
was
a
procedure
under
which
his
claim,
he
should
have
gone
up
through
the
general
courts
to
his
general
superintendent,
in
order
to
get
the
terms
of
the
contract
interpreted
and
he
chose
to
accept
that
discharge,
rather
than
go
through
that
procedure.
i
want
to
ask
you
this
question,
we've
said
and
spoken
on
that,
a
common
law,
a
statutory
action
for
wrongful
discharge,
not
only
different
from
any
remedy
which
the
board
has
power
to
provide,
but
it
--
the
board
couldn't
provide
it.
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
--
exactly
the
same
result
could
occur
here
from
an
action
by
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
â€“
he
said
one
thing
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
(inaudible),
you
said
that
--
you
felt
that
congress
intended
to
have
this
decided
by
that
board
even
after
the
man
cease
to
work
with
the
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
do
you
understand
was
the
basic
purpose
of
the
passing
of
the
act,
the
basic
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
prevent
strikes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
saying
that
the,
and
maybe
you
are
right,
you
are
saying
if
the
statutes
are
re-construed
showing
the
intent
of
congress
have
all
disputes
with
reference
to
a
contract
between
the
employer
and
employee
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
decided
by
the
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
that
relationship
has
ceased
to
exist,
they
have
ceased
to
exist
for
five
years
and
if
anything
has
to
come
up
he
is
still
has
to
go
this
special
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
can
just
find
that
in
the
congressional
intent
(inaudible)
i
am
not
saying
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
your
(inaudible)
what
is
his
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
same
remedy
that
the
railroad
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
it
decides
against
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
employee
cannot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
affirmed
here
by
the
equally
divided
court?
