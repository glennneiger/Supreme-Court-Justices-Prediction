justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
the
employer
of
the
railroad
this
--
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
which
has
had
a
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
the
other
way
around
the
court
wouldn't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
think,
why
do
you
think
they
could
not
have
gone
to
the
court,
had
he
continued
be
an
active
member?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
active
employee,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
your
view
is
the
reason
for
assuming
your
right
on
the
law,
what
is
the
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
consequences
from
taking
the
view
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
(inaudible)
to
adjustment
board
or
to
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
you
used
the
word
intended
or
intention,
well
the
fact
that
the
intention
is
so
crystal
clear
that
by
reading
that
statue
i
can
find
it,
can
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
words
i
can't
find
it,
i
cannot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
hasn't
said
that,
and
it
hasn't
used
words
that
indicate
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
there
must
be
a
legal
reason
than
that,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
just
because
they
want
to
put
railroad
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
not
that
--
this
doesn't
involve
the
non
peaceful
operations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
they
be
bound
by
the
adjudication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
could
have
the
court
say,
this
is
--
let
me
go
back.
if
the
railroad
admits
the
justice
of
the
claim
but
says
it
must
be
determined,
is
that
--
was
it
an
abstract
position
you
took?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
it
you
contest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there
was
involved
a
problem
of
construing
an
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
any
judge
--
is
every
judge
confident
by
reading
that
agreement
to
decide
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
confidence
doesn't
arise
from
the
fact
that
he
is
an
intelligent
judge,
does
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
case
tried
before
the
jury
or
judge
(inaudible)
assuming
there
is
jurisdiction
--
tried
to
jury
or
could
it
be
tried
to
a
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
jury
presented
a
verdict
which
would
--
in
which
the
construction
of
the
statute
wouldn't
be
so
clearly
adjudicated
that
it
would
come
up
here
to
this
court
by
chance
and
say
that
they
misconstrued
the
government,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
line
of
drawing
(inaudible)
that
and
i
am
rephrasing
the
sentence
then
to
effectively
to
what
justice
black
is
asking
is
the
moore
case,
may
the
moore
case
be,
it
could
be
pocketed
by
saying
that
in
moore,
he
says,
his
claim
is
that
the
railroad
has
denied
his
right
any
longer
to
have
any
rights
under
a
contract,
but
indeed
in
your
case,
he
is
seeking
some
right
under
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
moore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
gather
from
my
limited
agreement
with
the
result
in
that
case,
i
didn't
--
i
couldn't
agree
to
it,
i
dissented
in
the
case
(inaudible)
assume
i
want
to
(inaudible)
that
case
then
i
repeat
my
words
properly
in
good
conscious
by
saying
that
case
was
in
effect
a
suit
for
having
been
improperly
discharged,
having
had
his
relation
severed
which
were
not
suing
under
the
contract,
but
suing
that
the
contract
rights
had
denied
him
a
continuing
status
whereas
here
there
is
no
question
that
he
sues
under
a
statement
and
the
right
to
flow
from
that
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
your
memory
is
fresh
on
the
subject
and
mine
isn't,
that
was
merely
(inaudible).
in
the
moore
case
was
there
an
actual
contest
that
there
were
involved
so
called
technical
or
specialized
railroad
terms
which
a
court
would
have
to
--
which
if
a
court
construed,
which
a
court
would
have
to
construe
in
order
to
deal
with
the
case
and
that
such
a
constructions
maybe
an
embarrassment
to
the
construction
of
the
same
clause
in
railroad
adjustment
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
was
it
a
general
proposition
that
because
there
was
adjustment
scheme
you
must
always
go
to
the
adjustment
board.
in
the
case
(inaudible),
i
think
it's
acceptable
of
the
latter,
that
there
is
no
discussion
of
what
kind
of
issue
was
involved,
except
it
went
on
the
broad
base,
must
there
be
a
prior,
must
there
be
a
primary
likely
(inaudible)
case,
must
you
go
to
the
adjustment
because
such
is
the
structure
of
the
railway
labor
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
one
or
two
further
questions,
one
question
surely.
wrongful
discharges
or
a
distance
to
wrongful
discharges
are
usually
based
on
what
kind
of
claim,
why
wrongful?
why
does
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff
say
wrongful?
what
kind
of
right
is
the
railroad
invoking
which
the
ex-employee
proposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
impression
is
very
limited
evidence,
but
my
impression
is
that
the
discharge
cases
relate
to
problem
of
a
very
different
order
normally
than
claim
(inaudible)
or
claims
of
running
down
the
road
or
extra
pay,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
number,
but
in
quality
of
problems,
the
nature
of
the
problem,
and
once
you've
enumerated,
you
didn't
have
a
fair
hearing,
that
is
the
specialized
railroad
question
or
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
(inaudible)
didn't
fit
the
crime,
things
like
that,
there
were
very
different
orders
in
construing
technical
provisions
regarding
wages,
stages,
extra
pay,
preferential
treatment,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
it
not
a
different
position
of
consideration,
in
the
first
place
this
suit
began
while
he
was
still,
i
mean
still
had
status
of
employment,
is
it
not?
but
there's
another
consideration
to
the
extent
that
you
can
claim
under
a
collective
agreement
with
a
railroad,
it
can
be
taken
to
court
without
being
passed
on
by
the
board,
by
the
railroad
labor
machinery
and
a
favorable
result
is
given
in
a
court
under
a
provision
of
a
collective
agreement,
a
favorable
decision
for
the
construction
of
that
clause,
it
doesn't
require
a
much
imagination
to
realize
that
all
the
existing
employees
who
want
to
have
the
advantage
of
such
decisions
and
thereby
they
will
make
a
demand
and
if
that
demand
is
resisted
and
they
may
well
feel
that
the
railroad
isn't
obeying
a
court
order
and
you
might
get
the
potentiality
for
the
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
do
it
for
the
same
reason
that
it
can
take
away
the
common
law
right
of
unreasonable
rates
charged
by
railroads,
as
part
of
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce.
you
cannot
now,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
may
gouge
you
in
the
freight
claims
it
makes
against
the
shipment
value
and
that
common
law
before
1887
you
could
go
into
your
pennsylvania
courts
and
sue
for
that
gouging,
but
you
can't
do
it
today
without
first
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
although
the
act
says
every
common
law
right
shall
be
reserved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
the
--
that's
really
one
of
the
sources
of
the
difficulty
in
these
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
adjustment
board
is
way
behind
and
sometimes
doesn't
--
is
completely
behind,
it
doesn't
decide
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
me
what
that
judge
kalodner
meant,
what
is
meant
in
judge
kalodner's
opinion
on
page,
i
happened
to
have
that
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
“we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
district
court
was
not
without
jurisdiction
in
the
premises
and
that
at
this
stage
of
the
action
it
does
not
appear
that
the
plaintiff
either
should
be
barred
whatever
that
be
at
this
stage
of
the
action.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
means
this
is,
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that,
you
go
back
to
the
district
court,
would
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
mind
sketching
the
course
of
unfolding
the
development
what
would
happen
after
you
go
back?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
would
be
the
issues
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
any
--
any
provision
of
the
outstanding
collective
bargaining
agreement
be
called
into
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
basis
would
you
determine
--
would
you
determine
what
the
plaintiff
rights
were?
the
ones
--
were
they
spelled
out
in
any
contracts
or
they
might
have
business
practice,
custom
of
the
industry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
they
--
where
are
they
in
the
record?
where
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that
you
are
relying
on
clauses
in
the
contract,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
4a
(1)
and
4a2
(a)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
but
b
and
c,
are
they
also
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
would
this
--
would
be
a
jury
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
would
the
meaning
of
those
clauses
be
submitted
in
the
first
place
i
suppose
construed
by
the
court,
the
trial
court
and
would
they
be
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
just
as
we
cite
cases
here,
they
would
grow
on
prior
decisions
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
--
suppose
at
such
a
trial
the
decision
comes
out
in
your
favor,
a
number
of
other
employees,
present,
existing
employees
would
be
involved,
would
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
they
would
--
suppose
they
then
make
claim,
i
am
talking
about
--
it's
not
people
(inaudible)
but
existing
employees,
they
would
say
it's
just
been
decided
by
the
district
court
and
the
(inaudible)
judges
i
am
assuming
they
are
all
good
–
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
they
then
say
these
very
good
employees
would
say
whatever,
this
has
just
been
decided
and
we
come
under
exactly
the
same
provision
as
was
depriest
and
the
railroad
says
no,
we
don't
recognize
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
would
that
controversy
be
resolved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
happens
to
be
in
this
case
suppose
if
it
weren't,
what
about
new
employees
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
really
(inaudible)
existing
employees
couldn't
do
sue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
go
--
they
could
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
adjustment
board
would
meet
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
clear
in
the
open
place
that
in
the
determination
of
the
time
of
common
law
suit
if
you
have
brought
--
if
you
were
to
sue
and
if
you
have
up
to
this
moment
a
right
to
pursue
in
the
district
court
would
it
involve
construction
of
existing
provision
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
the
difference
between
getting
an
enforcement
suit
that
would
not
be
a
jury
trial,
there
would
be
no
questions
embedded
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
jury
(inaudible)
questions
of
law
to
find
the
validity
of
the
determination
if
there
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
happened
in
the
brotherhood
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
shapiro
case,
i've
been
looking
at
since
and
as
i
gather
the
opinion
of
the
judge
woodward
(inaudible)
that
was
the
case
for
both
the
extra
wages
by
supplemental
agreement
and
extra
wages
and
for
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
entertained
the
suit,
it
found
that
it
was
subject
to
a
common
law
action
and
not
subject
to
railway
labor
board
because
that
explicitly
had
no
power
to
pass
on
a
puerto
rican
railway
or
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly
and
this
interests
me
most
that
woodward
has
for
some
reason
rather
the
issue
of
improper
discharge
just
slipped
out
of
the
case
and
in
affirming
the
district
court
left
open
the
right
to
raise
that
question
of
discharge
as
a
separate
final
difference
cause
of
action
or
something
like
that
which
mr.
justice
black
suggested
namely
malicious
interference,
improper
abrogation
of
a
contract
relation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
united
states
attorney
might
appear
as
his
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
goes
back,
but
the
point
for
our
purpose
is
if
that
case
rather
brings
out
vividly
that
the
discharge,
a
discharge
proceeding
is
treated
as
something
independent
outside
of
the
reliance
of
a
clause
in
a
collective
agreement
which
has
to
be
interpreted
or
ultimately
maybe
interpreted
in
any
event
by
the
railway
labor
board.
i
think
that's
a
correct
statement,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
that
--
you
maybe
right
about
that
all
i
am
saying
the
shapiro
case
is
quite
consistent
with
my
point
of
view
an
enforcement
of
the
underlying
the
main
prospect
of
moore
namely
that
this
was
simple
discharge
insofar
it
was
any
question
of
what
wages
he
was
entitled
to
that
doesn't
help
us
in
this
case
because
it
was
found
that
the
railway
labor
board
had
no
jurisdiction
over
such
an
agreement
regarding
puerto
rico.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
not
only
my
general
respect
for
the
first
circuit,
but
equally
when
it
was
reinforced
there
was
judge
meyer's
associations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
accept
that
any
suggestion
of
a
discharge
proceeding
may
involve
a
suit
for
wages
under
a
collective
agreement
that
may
require
technical
construction
that
your
agreement
undoubtedly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
may
not,
as
i
look
back
at
the
moore
case,
wages
(inaudible)
apparently
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
adjustment
board
decides
against
the
employee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
theory
is
as
i
understand
it,
you
correct
me,
the
theory
is
that
when
the
board
decides
against
the
railroad,
they
--
an
administrative
judgment
is
entered
for
the
employee
and
the
board
itself
has
no
power
of
enforcement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
go
to
a
court
like
an
arbitral
award,
you
must
go
to
a
court
to
get
that
judgment
enforced
and
the
judgment
isn't
enforced
without
further
ado,
that
the
railroads
may
raise
questions
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
questions
they
may
raise
starts
with
the
presumptive
acceptance
of
that
award?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
more
than
that.
if
adjustment
board
makes
an
award
and
the
railroad
and
it
then
goes
to
the
court,
to
the
district
court
or
federal
district
court
for
enforcement
and
the
federal
district
court
adjudicates
the
scope
of
the
award,
wouldn't
the
adjustment
board
be
bound
by
that
court
determination
in
the
enforcement
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yeah
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
suppose
if
i
would
--
that
the
adjustment
board
can
disregard
a
decision
of
the
board
--
of
a
court,
perhaps
even
this
court,
to
which
the
award
of
the
board
went
any
less
than
the
icc
had
to
respect
the
review
of
its
award
in
reparation
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
well
that
means
it
was
respected
and
if
it
didn't,
you
get
mandamus
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
haven't
we
had
some
cases
here
in
which
the
question
was
raised
that
in
view
of
the
deadlock,
not
merely
a
time
lag,
but
a
deadlock
within
the
board,
there
isn't
any
decision,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there
is
a
deadlock
on
appointing
of
neutrals,
i
mean
the
--
justice
