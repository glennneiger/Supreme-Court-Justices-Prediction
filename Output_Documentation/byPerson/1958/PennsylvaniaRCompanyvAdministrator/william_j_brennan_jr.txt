justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
this
decree
might
have
brought
an
action
before
his
retirement,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
no
might
he
have
--
he
didn't
have
to
wait
for
retirement
before
asserting
his
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
his
seven
--
the
claim
a
motion
before
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
before
his
retirement
have
they
been
denied
by
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
where
i
gather,
this
was
a
diversity
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
claims
would
be
actionable
in
the
state
courts
too,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
mean
where
there
is
no
diversity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
the
three
suits
which
are
brought
before
the
board
were
seven
years
in
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
usual
proceeding
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
a
fruitful
source
of
irritation
between
the
employee
and
employer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
this
one
for
the
railroad
and
not
for
the
other,
i
don't
follow
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
think
what
you
said
earlier
is
that
in
such
an
enforcement
proceeding,
there
is
something,
i
think
you
used
the
word
de
novo
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
yet
you
said
that
whatever
the
review
maybe
and
however
he
may
get
it,
the
employee
--
the
consideration
in
the
employee's
case
is
whether
the
determination
of
the
board
rests
upon
substantial
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
any
comment
on
the
time
lag
(inaudible)
in
all
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
five
years
–
