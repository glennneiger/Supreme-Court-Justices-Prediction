mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl

we'll
recess
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
there
are
about
a
half
a
million
or
more
retired
railroad
men
in
every
railroad
center
large
and
small
in
the
nation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
place,
the
figure
600,000
i
don't
know
where
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
might
have
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
your
knowledge
did
the
moore
case
stimulate
much
litigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
much
of
that
final
litigation
now,
if
you
know,
if
you
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
through
that,
let's
--
but
it
is
the
fact
is
it
that
the
railroad
refuses
to
obey
an
award
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
the
railroad
is
entitled
to
trial
de
novo
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
you
have
one
of
those
cases
and
the
court
determines
it
one
way
and
the
board
continues
to
interpret
it
the
opposite,
do
you
not
have
the
same
situation
that
you
would
have
that
the
coin
was
reversed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
the
same
confusion;
you
would
have
the
same
conflict
that
you
told
us
would
result
if
we
permitted
the
former
employee
in
this
case
to
go
into
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
one
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
how
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
