mr.
mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
only
a
few
comments.
in
the
first
place
the
questions
of
remedy
after
an
adjustment
board
award
of
review
or
finality
of
the
award
is
not
in
this
case
at
this
time.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
my
statement.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
know
of
one
enforcement
suit
in
25
years
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad
in
the
so
called
trial
de
novo.
i
know
of
very
few
suits
following
awards
by
employees
on
any
railroads
to
contest
the
findings
and
the
facts
for
the
situation
has
been
with
regard
to
the
railroad
right
to
trial
de
novo,
the
general
practical
situation
has
been
that
during
the
period
following
an
adjustment
board
award
the
union
pressure
has
been
so
great
on
the
railroads,
economic
pressure,
that
there
are
very
few
cases
that
have
ever
gotten
in
to
court.
in
the
washington
terminal
case
mr.
justice
rufus
then
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
my
opinion
simply
decided
that
during
the
two-year
period
following
an
award
when
it
is
valid,
an
award
--
a
railroad
cannot
go
to
court
under
the
declaratory
judgment
action
to
attack
that
award.
i
believe
it
also
stands
for
the
proposition
that
you
could
not,
even
before
the
adjustment
board
award,
go
and
get
a
declaratory
judgment
in
a
claim
by
an
active
employee.
now
there
is
an
interesting
problem
that
comes
in
the
connection
with
this
situation.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
there
is
a
court
remedy
for
the
employee
who
has
won
his
case
before
the
board.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
act
provides
that
the
finding
of
facts
of
the
board
shall
have
a
prima
facie
value.
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
the
court
below
in
the
boswell
case
said
that
in
effect
that
amounts
to
a
having
the
weight
of
expert
testimony.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
under
the
act,
as
it
is
presently
construed,
there
is
no,
as
i
understand
it
and
there
are
very
few
decisions,
there
is
no
review
on
the
merits.
the
courts
have
generally
held
that
if
there
is
â€“
are
allegations
of
fraud,
duress,
lack
of
due
process,
lack
of
compliance
with
procedural
requirements
of
the
act,
lack
of
notice,
then
the
court
may
take
such
action
as
is
necessary.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
and
the
--
either
party,
if
there's
a
dispute
about
the
award
can
go
back
for
an
interpretation
to
the
board
and
if
a
neutral
has
decided
the
case
ordered
by
the
mediation
board
or
chosen
by
agreement,
he
comes
in
and
participates
in
the
interpretation,
that
happens
in
many
cases.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
you
mean
you
would
have
to
accept
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
the
review
of
the
adjustment
board
proceeding
now
is
different
in
that
case
the
court
has
the
expert
advice
of
the
adjustment
board.
now
if
it
chooses
to
ignore
that,
i
presume
you
have
the
ordinary
courts
of
appeals
who
will
file
the
termination
and
i
think
that
even
the
adjustment
board
would
accept
a
termination
of
the
merits
in
case
of
a
higher
court,
and
it
is
likely
that
the
referees
and
others
decide
those
cases
in
the
future
might
feel
themselves
bound
in
considerable
weight,
through
a
fairly
considered
court
decision,
which
reverts
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
in
the
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
at
least
for
that
individual
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
it
would
certainly
have
great
weight
to
similar
cases
under
the
same
agreement,
of
course
the
fact
(inaudible)
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
that
the
board
which
happened
to
grant
(inaudible)
same
respect.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
may
i
make
two
brief
comments
before
my
time
finishes?
in
the
first
place
i
meant
to
point
out
earlier
in
my
argument
and
fail
to
that
saying
that
when
a
man
retires
or
otherwise
leaves
service
he
can't
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
also
works
a
hardship
on
the
employee.
there
are
special
advantages
to
the
employees
in
the
adjustment
board
procedure.
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
rutledge
in
barber
case,
which
would
not
be
available
in
court,
the
railway
labor
act,
in
section
3
first
he
provides
that
an
employee
--
an
enforcement
proceeding
does
not
have
to
pay
any
cost,
it
is
paid
by
the
united
states
government
such
as
court
of
appeal,
likewise
he
is
entitled
to
attorneys
fees.
and
the
further
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
closing,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
holds,
that
retired
employees,
discharged
employees
and
others
who
have
left
the
service
for
one
reason
or
other
can
take
this
type
of
claim
to
the
board.
the
railroads
also
should
have
the
right
to
ask
for
declaratory
judgment
for
the
same
type
of
disputes,
in
claims
brought
by
those
people.
that
would
mean
and
i
am
sure
this
would
be
opposed
by
every
railroad
labor
union
in
the
country,
because
in
that
way
the
railroads
would
circumvent
the
southern
railroad
case,
the
order
of
railway
conductors
against
southern
railway,
which
said
that
you
could
not
go
get
a
declaratory
judgment
with
regard
to
an
agreement
which
would
affect
the
future
relations.
you
would
have
a
court
decision
perhaps
involving
only
retired
employees
or
those
who
had
quit,
which
would
permit
the
--
perhaps
a
court
of
appeals
decision
on
the
interpretation
of
an
agreement,
which
was
certainly
over
the
objection
of
the
unions
to
be
committed
to
stand
rather
than
independent
determinations
for
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
there
always
has
been
a
time
lag
before
that
board.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that,
that
is
pretty
much
unusual.
it
depends
on
the
division
involved.
there
are
four
divisions
of
the
board
with
jurisdiction
over
different
types
of
employees.
the
majority
of
the
claims
come
from
the
operating
employees
in
the
first
division.
i
think
the
board
has
probably
handled
26,000
claims
in
the
25
years
of
those
employees
and
of
late
years
there
has
not
been
as
much
in
the
way
because
in
many
cases
the
railroads
and
employees
have
agreed
to
setup
special
boards
on
individual
properties
to
dispose
of
the
cases
and
the
backlog
is
way
down
below
what
it
used
to
be.
the
other
divisions
are
pretty
much
up-to-date,
they
have
decisions
within
six
months
in
some
cases.
the
first
division
still
has
delay
which
i
estimate
at
the
present
time
is
about
a
three-year
delay.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
if
there
is
a
deadlock
within
the
board,
the
parties
by
the
act
are
directed
to
agree
on
a
neutral
to
decide
or
to
ask
the
mediation
board
to
appoint
a
neutral.
the
question
of
deadlock
where
nothing
is
decided
is
where
the
question
of
change
in
rule
is
involved,
which
requires
a
majority
vote
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well
if
there
is
deadlock
in
appointing
a
neutral
then
either
side
can
ask
the
mediation
board
to
appoint
one.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
three
men
and
i
have
never
heard
of
it.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
it
is
(inaudible)
