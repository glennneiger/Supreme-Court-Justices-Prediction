mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
under
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
review
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
issue
here
is
whether
an
employee
who
is
retired
from
railroad
employment
may
sue
in
the
federal
district
court
to
recover
wage
claims
involving
work
which
he
performed
while
he
was
an
active
railroad
employee
on
the
basis
of
provisions
of
a
collective
bargain
--
collectively
bargained
railroad
labor
agreement.
or
whether
such
claims
are
to
be
decided
exclusively
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
established
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there
is
no
question
on
this
case
as
to
the
review
or
finality
of
awards
of
the
board.
it
is
simply
a
question
as
to
the
initial
jurisdiction
over
such
claims
by
a
retired
employee.
the
plaintiff
in
the
district
court
below
was
employed
by
the
railroad
as
a
fireman
and
engineer
for
a
total
of
40
years
and
he
retired
in
march
1955
resigning
and
applying
for
an
annuity
under
the
railroad
retirement
act.
during
that
period
of
seven
years
before
his
retirement,
he
had
filed
claims
with
the
railroad
contending
that
he
was
entitled
for
additional
pay
under
the
agreement
between
the
railroad
and
its
engineers
represented
by
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers.
mr.
depriest
claimed
that
on
numerous
occasions
throughout
this
period,
he
was
required,
as
engineer,
to
take
a
train
outside
his
assigned
switching
limits
on
--
and
on
the
tracks
of
a
foreign
railroad
that
on
each
of
the
some
allegedly
thousand
occasions
that
he
did
this,
he
was
entitled
to
receive
an
extra
day's
wages
as
engineer
in
addition
to
his
regular
pay.
these
claims
were
handled
under
the
administrative
procedure
of
the
agreement
in
the
normal
course
of
handling
on
the
property
and
were
denied
by
the
railroad
which
contested
the
claims
on
the
basis
that
mr.
depriest
had
not
operated
trains
outside
the
switching
limits
and
that
they
had
not
been
operated
on
the
tracks
of
a
foreign
railroad
within
the
meaning
of
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
on
which
mr.
depriest
provide.
however,
upon
his
retirement,
mr.
depriest
brought
this
suit
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
for
these
extra
days
pay
which
he
claimed
and
his
complaint
was
the
normal
type
of
diversity
complaint
alleging
he
was
a
citizen
of
new
jersey,
pennsylvania
railroad
a
citizen
of
pennsylvania
and
alleging
a
jurisdiction
with
the
amount
well
in
excess
of
that
required
by
the
statute.
the
railroad
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
was
in
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
district
court
below,
in
his
first
opinion
in
a
145
federal
supplement
596
agreed
that
this
was
a
type
of
claim
over
which
the
national
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
however,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
because
there
were
other
similar
claims
pending
before
the
adjustment
board
which
might
establish
some
right
and
mr.
depriest
to
recover
in
the
court
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
certain
questions
with
regard
to
statutes
of
limitations
have
been
raised.
the
district
court
will
retain
jurisdiction
but
upon
request
would
stay
all
proceedings
until
the
awards
of
the
adjustment
board
had
been
handed
down
in
those
other
cases.
accordingly,
such
an
order
staying
proceeding
was
entered
and
an
appeal
was
taken
by
this
order
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
appeal
for
lack
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
about
this
time,
mr.
depriest
died
and
his
administrator
was
appointed
by
the
new
jersey
court
and
substituted
as
plaintiff
in
this
action.
while
the
appeal
was
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
national
board
handed
down
awards
in
three
similar
claims
for
pay
for
engineers
who
under
similar
circumstances
performed
this
type
of
work
in
the
philadelphia
area
where
mr.
depriest's
claims
arose.
these
awards
denied
the
similar
claims
and
since
this
had
happened
and
the
proceedings
had
been
stayed
in
the
district
court
pending
the
decisions
on
these
awards,
the
railroad
again
moved
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
claims
on
the
same
basis
before
that
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
thus
jurisdiction
being
exclusively
in
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
court?
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
board
has
in
those
three
cases
which
are
i
believe
found
in
the
appendix
in
the
transcript
of
record.
the
three
awards
are
on
--
beginning
on
page
9,
the
certificate
of
the
award
is
on
page
9
and
the
awards
are
found
on
pages
10
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
--
10
following
in
the
transcript
of
records.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
prior
to
the
lunch
and
recess
i
pointed
out
that
after
the
adjustment
board
handed
down
awards
in
these
other
cases,
the
railroad
again
moved
that
the
suit
be
dismissed
in
the
district
court
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
this
motion
was
granted
by
the
district
court,
which
entered
an
order
dismissing
the
suit
on
the
basis
--
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
on
review,
the
court
of
appeals
below
vacated
this
order
and
remanded
case
for
further
proceedings.
this
is
the
decision
from
which
the
writ
was
requested
by
petitioner.
the
court
held
that
the
railway
labor
act
did
not
deprive
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
claim
for
wages
under
the
provisions
of
the
agreement.
now
in
order
to
clarify
the
issues
here,
i
should
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
with
the
order
dismissing
the
case
held
that
these
awards
which
the
board
had
handed
down
in
other
disputes
were
binding
on
the
plaintiff
mr.
depriest
and
his
successor.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
reversing
the
district
court,
held
that
they
were
not
binding.
however,
that
question
has
not
been
raised
before
this
court
that
is
not
involved
in
the
petition,
the
question
of
the
effect
of
these
other
awards
on
the
claims
presented
by
respondent
here.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
based
primarily
on
this
court's
decision
in
moore
versus
illinois
central
in
312
united
states.
there
this
court
held
that
a
railroad
employee
who
is
discharged
by
his
employer
was
not
required
to
exhaust
his
remedies
under
the
railway
labor
act,
but
could
bring
a
suit
in
court
for
damages
for
the
wrongful
discharge.
the
court
below,
in
this
proceeding,
said
they
could
find
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
the
wage
claims,
these
claims
for
extra
days
pay
presented
by
mr.
depriest
in
a
suit
in
--
for
damages
for
wrongful
discharge.
the
petitioner
respectfully
submits
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
in
error
and
that
the
district
court,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
in
view
of
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board
over
claims
of
this
type,
did
not
have
and
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
these
pay
claims.
the
moore
case
on
which
the
court
below
rested
its
opinion
is
the
earliest
case
to
come
before
this
court
with
regard
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board.
moore,
upon
discharge,
brought
his
suit
for
damages
against
the
railroad,
and
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
mr.
justice
black,
in
his
opinion,
stated
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
purporting
to
take
away
from
the
courts
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
a
controversy
of
a
wrongful
discharge
or
to
make
an
administrative
finding
a
prerequisite
to
filing
a
suit
in
court.
there
was
language
in
his
opinion
which
at
that
time
was
believed
to
indicate
that
both
the
railroads
and
their
employees
could
--
were
free
to
go
either
to
court
or
to
the
adjustment
board
with
any
type
of
grievance
or
claim
or
dispute.
however,
subsequent
cases
in
this
court
have
limited
the
jury
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
and
these
disputes
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
collective
agreements
in
the
railroad
industry.
in
1946,
in
order
of
railway
conductors
against
pitney
this
court
held
that
a
district
court
which
was
administrating
a
railroad
then
in
bankruptcy
should
exercise
its
equitable
discretion,
permit
a
dispute
over
the
manning
of
trains
between
conductors
and
trainmen,
the
organizations
to
be
preliminarily
decided
at
least
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
this
court
pointed
out
that
congress
had
created
in
the
adjustment
board
an
agency
especially
competent
and
specifically
designated
to
deal
with
the
intricate
and
technical
and
factual
questions
involved
in
the
dispute.
and
again
in
1950,
this
court
held
in
the
slocum
case,
slocum
versus
delaware,
lackawanna
&
western
and
in
the
order
of
railway
conductors
case,
both
in
399
us,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
a
national
railroad
adjustment
board
over
this
type
of
dispute
arising
under
the
railroad
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
exclusive.
the
slocum
case
involved
a
dispute
on
the
delaware,
lackawanna
between
the
telegraphers
and
the
clerks
over
the
filling
of
certain
jobs.
the
railroad
went
to
the
state
court
of
new
york
for
declaratory
judgment
as
to
which
--
as
to
which
group
of
employees
should
be
used
for
these
particular
jobs
and
the
court
granted
that
declaratory
judgment.
when
the
case
was
brought
here,
the
decision
of
the
state
court
was
reversed
and
in
his
opinion
mr.
justice
black
said,
this
case
--
in
this
case
the
dispute
concerned
interpretation
of
an
existing
bargaining
agreement.
a
settlement
would
have
prospective
as
well
as
retrospective
accordance
to
both
the
railroad
and
its
employees,
since
the
interpretation
accepted
would
govern
the
future
relations
of
those
parties.
this
type
of
agreements
has
long
been
considered
a
potent
cause
friction
leading
to
strikes.
the
act
does
represents
considered
effort
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
provide
effective
and
desirable
administrative
remedies
for
the
adjustment
of
railroad
employee
disputes
growing
out
of
the
interpretation
of
existing
agreements.
the
adjustment
board
is
well
equipped
to
exercise
its
congressionally
imposed
functions.
its
members
understand
railroad
problems
and
speak
the
railroad
jargon.
long
and
varied
experiences
have
added
to
the
board's
initial
qualifications
and
it
went
on
to
talk
about
desirability
of
the
precedence
and
uniform
interpretation
of
railroad
labor
contracts.
the
companion
case
the
same
day,
reached
the
same
conclusion.
these
were
claims
involved
in
the
order
of
railway
conductors
case
claims
for
extra
pay
by
conductors,
similar
to
the
claims
that
mr.
depriest
presented
to
petitioner.
and
the
court
held
that
over
these
claims
the
adjustment
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
then
a
separate
opinion
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
black
stated
that
the
case
sharply
points
up
the
conflicts
that
could
arise
from
state
court
intervention
in
these
disputes.
in
that
particular
case
as
the
opinion
pointed
out
after
the
suit
was
brought,
the
union
representing
these
conductors
took
the
case
to
the
adjustment
board,
but
despite
that
fact
the
court
i
believe
the
south
carolina
court
proceeded
to
grant
declaratory
judgment.
and
that
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
my
position
your
honor
is
that
in
this
case
before
his
retirement
and
after
his
retirement
he
could
only
take
these
claims
to
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
he
did
assert
his
claims
before
his
retirement,
the
claims
were
pending
before
his
retirement,
and
they
rose
out
of
work
which
he
performed
during
the
seven
years
before
his
retirement
beginning
in
1948.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
they
had
been
handled
with
the
railroad
under
the
usual
procedure
for
handling
grievances
with
the
employees.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
they
had
come
--
they
had
not
gone
to
any
board
they
had
been
denied
by
the
railroad,
they
were
among
many
similar
claims
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
don't
know
the
exact
date.
under
the
normal
railroad
agreement
a
claim
is
filed
say
with
a
man's
immediate
supervisor
and
most
agreements
provide
that
unless
it's
denied,
they
have
to
be
denied
within
10
days
of
(inaudible)
and
then
there
is
a
progression
to
higher
officers
of
the
railroad
and
the
railway
labor
act
doesn't
spell
that
out,
but
normally
there
is
an
agreement
on
each
railroad
providing
with
time
limits
the
levels
to
which
those
are
handled.
normally
also
there
is
a
time
limit
within
which
a
claim
can
be
presented,
but
he
had
presented
claims
beginning
in
1948.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
great
many
claims
as
the
record
will
show
of
other
employees
too
including
these
have
gone
to
the
adjustment
board
in
that
during
this
period.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that
is
my
position
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
do
not
believe
that
my
opponent
would
differ
with
me
on
that,
although
there
is
an
indication
in
his
brief
that
he
believes
that
whether
an
employee
is
in
active
service
or
not,
he
has
a
right
to
go
to
court.
there
is
an
indication
in
his
brief
which
i
will
get
to
little
bit
later.
i
don't
--
i
think
i
cannot
frankly
say
this
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
mislead
the
court
or
have
to
be
contradicted
by
mr.
davis.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
an
active
employee.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
under
the
basis
of
the
slocum
case
which
held
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board
is
exclusive
with
regard
to
these
pay
claims
involving
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
reason
for
that
is
that
congress
has
intended
the
settlement
of
these
disputes
to
be
kept
in
the
railroad
family
in
this
state
within
a
state,
as
this
court
has
characterized
the
railroad
industry
and
has
provided
a
detailed
method
with
specific
remedies
for
the
employees
giving
them
special
advantages
over
the
employers
and
a
statutory
remedy
which
removes
from
the
courts
the
necessity
to
enter
into
these
technical
interpretations
of
collective
agreements.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
southern
railway
case
where
he
said
that,
that
would
result
in
a
race
of
diligence,
employee
which
could
get
to
the
court
or
to
the
board
first
or
to
get
a
decision
first
from
one
of
the
other
would
have
the
advantage
and
it
would
also
deprive,
the
one
who
went
to
court
would
deprive
the
other
party
of
the
right
granted
by
congress
to
go
to
go
the
adjustment
board.
that
has
been
pointed
out
again
of
course
your
honor
in
chicago
river
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1957,
which
held
that
in
effect
congress
intended
the
adjustment
board
to
be
a
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
and
gave
specifically
in
the
act
a
right
to
either
party
to
go
that
board
and
if
either
party
went
to
the
board,
the
findings
were
binding
on
both
parties.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor
if
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
intention
to
make
--
to
have
these
cases
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
well,
if
the
intention
which
i
think
has
been
evidenced
in
almost
all
railroad
labor
legislation
to
provide
for
settlement
more
or
less
within
the
family
of
these
disputes
so
far
as
possible.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
well,
in
order
to
prevent
an
interruption
--
in
order
to
prevent
interruptions
to
commerce
and
to
permit
the
peaceful
operations
of
railroads
among
others.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
this
case
itself
could
involve
the
non
peaceful
operation
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
my
argument
here.
i'm
anticipating
myself,
but
the
distinction
here
which
lower
court
made
is
that
if
he
were
an
employee
he
would
be
bound
by
slocum
and
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
but
now
he
is
retired.
somehow
perhaps
he
is
physically
removed,
perhaps
he
isn't
from
his
other
employees,
but
it
doesn't
matter
what
happens
to
the
claim
of
employee
who
is
retried
and
in
my
brief
and
again
in
my
argument
i
wish
to
point
out
that
when
you
have
claims
of
the
same
kind,
held
by
a
class
or
potentially
held
by
a
class,
and
for
some
reason
you
say
those
are
retired
or
resigned
or
get
fired
can
take
their
claims
to
court
have
them
decided
there,
but
everybody
who
stays
in
the
railroad
employment
must
go
to
the
adjustment
board
under
the
slocum
case.
inevitably
you
are
going
to
have
the
problem
that
the
man
who
retires
will
go
to
court
and
win
one
of
these
cases
and
all
this
body
with
similar
claims
before
the
adjustment
board
may
lose
their
cases,
it
could
be
the
reverse.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
this
court
held
in
the
moore
case
that
if
there
is
any
interpretation
made
by
a
collective
agreement
by
a
court
in
connection
with
one
of
these
wrongful
discharge
cases,
it
would
not
be
binding
upon
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
in
this
case
no.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
we
contest
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
there
is
a
problem
with
construing
an
agreement
and
together
with
that
agreement
the
use
of
just
customs
and
practices
in
the
railroad
industry
that
have
grown
up
under
that
agreement.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
wish
that
every
judge
were
confident
so
to
decide
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor,
the
difficulty
is
that
you
take
an
agreement
of
the
kind
of
here
and
the
provision
involved
in
this
case
as
quoted
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties,
and
you
run
into
term
such
as
those
here
involved,
foreign
railroad,
switching
limits,
work
outside,
emergencies,
all
those
things
mean
definite
things
to
somebody
who
reads
them
or
who
hasn't
read
a
railroad
labor
agreement
before,
but
it
certainly
is
astounding
what
they
can
mean
in
the
hands
of
the
adjustment
board.
and
it
takes
into
consideration
also
--
you
have
so
many
things
to
take
into
consideration,
because
the
language
maybe
clear
or
seemingly
clear,
but
you
find
that
the
railroad
meaning
is
entirely
opposite
to
that.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
it's
inevitable
that
if
the
adjustment
board
does
not
have
the
jurisdiction
over
these
disputes.
we
will
have
court
decisions
which
conflict
on
the
same
railroad
under
the
same
agreement
and
when
that
happens,
if
it
--
certainly
if
it's
the
case
where
the
men
working
on
the
railroad
have
lost
their
claims
before
the
adjustment
board,
that
the
man
who
retired
has
won
his,
you
are
going
to
have
intense
dissatisfaction
among
your
employees.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
one
of
the
arguments
presented
by
respondent
here
is
that
to
require
submission
to
the
adjustment
board
would
mean
to
deprive
the
respondent
of
the
right
to
a
trial
by
a
jury
under
the
seventh
amendment.
i
assume
there
would
be
trial
before
the
jury.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
couldn't
tell
you
how
many,
but
in
my
brief
i
closely
--
the
adjustment
board
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor,
i
wish
i
could
adopt
your
figures,
but
in
my
brief
there
is
a
footnote.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
on
page
30
of
petitioner's
brief
there
is
a
footnote
pointing
out
that
in
1956
to
1957
there
were
some
361,000
retired
road
employees
receiving
annuities
from
the
retirement
board.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
and
that,
in
the
following
year
about
42,000
retired.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
may
i
suggest
this
also,
this
isn't
confined
to
retiring
employees,
because
the
basis
on
which
the
court
below
decided
the
case
was
that
upon
his
retirement,
mr.
depriest
was
no
longer
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
therefore
the
adjustment
board
had
no
jurisdiction
apparently.
although
the
court
doesn't
specifically
say
that
the
adjustment
board
has
no
jurisdiction
nor
that
there
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction,
but
it
closed
the
definition
of
employee.
it
relies
on
the
fact
that
in
the
moore
case,
moore
quit
his
employment,
gave
up
his
right
to
employment
and
apparently
his
position
is
that
anyone
who
ceases
to
be
railroad
employee,
if
he
has
a
wage
claim
of
some
kind
against
the
railroad
under
one
of
these
agreements
can
then
sue
in
court.
so
not
only
we
do
have
retired
employees,
we
have
all
those
who
work
for
a
month
for
the
railroad
and
quit
and
anyone
else
who
has
been
in
railroad
employment
and
then
says
well
i've
given
it
up,
it
may
even
apply
to
people
that
(inaudible)
forced
reduction,
then
wouldn't
say
well
i'll
quit,
but
go
to
court
and
collect
these
claims.
see
that
was
--
there
is
a
further
source
here
of
difficulty
for
the
railroads
and
the
unions
and
the
adjustment
board,
because
inevitably
if
a
contract
is
construed
by
the
adjustment
board
as
providing
one
thing,
which
would
deny
the
claim
from
employees,
but
some
court
or
jury
and
some
state
court
possibly
holds
contrary
wise
with
regard
to
retire
to
other
employee,
you
then
have
the
fact
that
that
is
undoubtedly
going
to
be
pressure
on
the
union.
there's
going
to
be
dissatisfaction.
now
employees
will
say,
well
now
he
can
quit
his
job
and
collect
this
money,
but
the
union
can't
collect
it
from
me,
and
i
can't
go
to
the
adjustment
board
and
get
it
because
they
rule
out
these
claims,
and
there
will
be
pressure,
difficulty;
perhaps
even
demands
from
the
unions
that
the
agreement
be
changed,
which
would
be
probably
the
most
logical
thing
which
in
turn
could
result
in
eventual
disruption
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
this
was
a
diversity
case
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
well
of
course
this
case
under
the
complaint
alleges
damages
of
$27,000,
which
would
meet
even
the
new
standards
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
where
there
is
no
diversity
it
would
fall
into
state
court
under
the
theory
below.
so
we
would
have
not
only
a
conflict
--
if
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
somebody
who
has
left
railroad
employment
by
retiring
or
resigning,
then
you
have
the
problem
of
conflicting
court
decisions.
if
you
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
those
cases
you
have
conflicts
not
only
between
the
courts
but
with
the
board
decisions
and
petitioners
urges
here
that
the
intention
of
congress
to
provide
a
self
contained
and,
let
me
say
a
method
of
preventing
difficulties
in
the
railroad
industry,
as
indicated
in
this
court's
prior
decisions,
can
only
be
met
by
holding
that
if
the
man
is
an
employee
subject
to
a
collective
agreement
when
he,
when
his
claim
arises
for
pay
or
whatever
it
is,
no
matter
what
happens
to
on
the
change
of
status
after
that
that
is
a
dispute
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act
it
arises
when
he
is
an
employee.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor,
i
believe
that
moore
has
been
generally
held
and
i
believe
it
should
be
properly
held
to
apply
only
to
a
wrongful
discharge
situation.
in
the
moore
case
mr.
justice
black
and
in
the
slocum
case
distinguish
it
--
distinguishing
it
i
--
in
my
opinion
the
prime
distinction
is
that
it
was
held
in
those
cases
that
the
courts
could
provide
a
remedy
and
damages
for
wrongful
discharge
which
the
board
could
not
provide.
in
other
words,
the
moore
case
held
that
congress,
in
setting
up
the
system,
did
not
intend
to
deprive
the
employees
of
the
common
law
statutory
right
to
bring
in
action
for
breach
of
contract
as
distinguished
from
a
claim
involving
wages
under
the
alleged
interpretation
of
the
contract.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor
–
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor,
in
the
slocum
case,
in
distinguishing
the
moore
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
decision
of
the
court
might
or
might
not
involve
interpretation,
but
if
it
did
it
would
not
affect
future
relation
of
the
employees.
now
in
your
wrongful
discharge
case
and
i
am
speaking
practically
from
the
standpoint
normally
it's
a
question
of
procedure
in
connection
with
the
discipline
or
whether
the
discipline
justified
discharge.
that
isn't
the
type
of
dispute
which
a
man
retiring
leaves
with
other,
with
other
employees.
a
man
who
is
discharged,
he
doesn't
leave
behind
him
on
the
railroad
property
a
lot
of
people
with
the
same
claims,
the
same
--
there
isn't
likely
to
be
the
conflict
in
decision
there.
each
wrongful
discharge
case
in
effect
is
a
different
case.
now
there
is
a
possibility
mr.
justice
black
that
a
court
may
say
such
and
such
a
rule
is
followed
by
the
railroad
in
conducting
this
one
proceeding
is
unfair
or
it
was
improperly
applied,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing.
the
court
--
the
railroad
normally
in
a
case
like
that
will
correct
any
procedure
it
has,
would
follow
the
court
action
in
order
to
avoid
possible
future
damage
suits
for
wrongful
discharge
but
it
does
affect
the
relations
of
the
employees
in
the
same
way
that
a
claim
under
the
agreement
involving
seniority
or
severance
pay
or
something
of
that
sort
would
do.
here
mr.
depriest
when
he
retired,
left
numerous
similar
claims
pending
on
the
property.
if
he
has,
if
he
has
or
is
--
the
opportunity
to
go
to
court,
he
is
required
to
go
to
court,
there
is
the
clear
chance
that
other
people
who
are
in
the
identical
situation
with
claims
arising
for
identical
work
will
have
their
claims
denied
and
this
dissatisfaction
will
be
created
by
a
contrary
interpretation
by
some
judge
or
jury
with
regard
to
the
identical
claims.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
when
the
claim
arose
mr.
justice
douglas,
he
was
an
employee.
his
claim
is
entirely
based
on
the
employee
relationship.
in
view
of
the
importance
of
this,
i
feel
that
congress
intended
that
the
railway
labor
act
should
take
hold
at
the
time
the
claim
arose,
not
at
the
time
maybe
5,
10,
15
years
later
when
he
might
retire,
then
relinquish
it
and
permit
him
to
go
to
court
to
sue.
i
feel
that
once
that
claim
arises
from
the
employer-employee
relationship
from
the
collective
–
interpretation
of
the
collective
agreement
–covering
that,
it
is
no
stretch
of
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
say
that
that
procedure
having
taken
hold,
it
applies
throughout
the
handling
of
that
claim.
may
i
point
out
mr.
justice
douglas
that
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
with
regard
to
this
in
section
3
(1)
(i)
&
(j)
which
are
on
page
41
of
the
appendix
of
the
petitioner's
brief
section
3
(1)
(i)
says
that
disputes
between
an
employee
or
a
group
of
employees
and
a
carrier,
carriers
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
your
honor
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
this
gentleman
was
an
employee
when
the
dispute
arose.
now
if
the
adjustment
of
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board,
is
confined
that
strictly.
it
means
that
there
are
many,
many
situations
in
which
inevitably
the
courts
would
be
given
jurisdiction
which
i
submit
to
the
court
has
not
been
the
intention
of
congress.
for
example
you
have
an
agreement
providing
severance
pay
or
separation
allowances.
i
don't
know
of
many
in
the
railroad
industry
but
they
are
common
in
the
industry.
if
you
have
an
agreement
of
that
kind
providing
say,
x
number
of
days'
pay
at
the
employees
last
regular
rate
for
each
year
of
service
that
he
has
performed
for
the
railroad,
if
there
is
any
dispute
about
the
application
of
those
things,
it
will
never
arise
when
the
man's
employment
has
been
terminated.
and
all
of
those
questions
and
they
are
not
as
simple
as
they
sound
even
from
the
language
i
have
given
you,
but
inevitably
would
be
before
the
courts
rather
than
for
the
adjustment
board.
in
other
words,
it
amazes
me
in
fact
that
this
case
has
not
come
before
this
court
before
since
the
--
since
the
act
has
been
in
existence
for
25
years.
as
the
records
shows
the
adjustment
board
has
handled
these
claims
of
retired
employees,
claims
by
states
of
the
deceased
employees
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
has
the
full
remedy
to
provide
the,
in
those
cases
what
is
required.
if
you
go
to
the
courts
you
have
the
conflict
of
decisions
and
the
confusion
which
the
slocum
case
indicated
was
not
intended
by
congress
with
regard
to
this
type
of
dispute.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
would
suggest
that
any
claim
arising
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
arising
through
the
employment
under
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
should
be
within
the
purview
of
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that
would
not
bring
moore
in,
in
my
opinion
because
that
is
a
different
type
of
suit.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
it's
an
entirely
different
suit.
there
maybe
an
interpretation
there
but
the
suit
doesn't
arise
from
that.
in
moore
the
wrongful
discharge
was
necessary
before
--
or
a
discharge
from
a
point
was
necessary
before
the
suit
could
be
brought.
in
a
case
of
this
type
where
the
man
retires
or
quits
or
is
fired
from
his
job
none
of
those
incidents
have
anything
to
do
his
actual
claim.
it
maybe
true
in
the
severance
pay
case
that
maybe
a
borderline
one
there
i
must
admit,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
have
given
that
as
an
example
earlier,
but
the
claim
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
subsequent
retirement.
in
wrongful
discharge
suit
in
moore,
you
have
a
different
type
of
remedy
being
asked,
something
the
adjustment
board
cannot
give
and
in
addition
to
that,
you,
you
have
the
fact
that
if
it
weren't
for
the
termination
of
employment
there
wouldn't
be
any
claim.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
if
he
was
no
longer
an
employee
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
well
of
course,
mr.
justice
black
there
is
an
area
which
the
act
apparently
does
not
cover
which
would
involve
that
type
of
thing
and
that
is
the
suit
by
the
employee
against
the
union
for
improper
representations
through
making
an
agreement
or
handling
a
grievance
and
those
cases
have
been
--
have
been
held
to
be
within
the
court's
jurisdiction
because
they
are
not
disputes
between
the
railroad
and
the
employee.
but
here
you
have
a
dispute
which
initially
and
ever
since
that
has
been
really
an
employee
railroad
dispute.
if
he
hadn't
enjoyed
this
employee
status
under
the
collective
agreement
he
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
this.
he
is
claiming
under
the
agreement.
the
fact
he
is
retired
as
incidental
as
if,
he
had
been
promoted
out
of
the
agreement
to
a
supervisory
position
or
anything
else
that
might
have
happened
to
him
and
in
our
opinion
these
cases
conceivably
if
the
door
is
opened
to
court
suits
either
concurrent
with
the
adjustment
board
jurisdiction
or
exclusively
for
the
courts,
as
indicated
by
the
opinion
below,
would
create
a
fertile
source
of
controversy
and
difficult
in
railroad
field.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
like
to
agree
with
you,
but
remember
that
in
the
wrongful
discharge,
you
may
have
the
element
of
a
denial
of
right
during
a
discipline
hearing
for
example
prior
to
discharge
which
may
also
be
involved
in
that
suit.
it's
certain
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
may
i
point
out
that
the
language
which
i
had
meant
to
quote
the
court
which
distinguishes
the
moore
case
in
the
slocum
opinion,
although
it
says
having
ceased
to
be
an
employee
he
brought
action
for
wrongful
discharge,
he
accepted
his
discharge.
in
my
opinion
there
is
nothing
in
that
language
which
should
be
construed
to
mean
that
having
ceased
to
be
an
employee
you
can
bring
any
type
of
a
claim
against
your
employer
and
the
railway
labor
act
no
longer
applies.
i
feel
that
it
is
essential
that
the
administration
of
the
act,
that
the
decision
in
moore
be
pocketed
to
the
type
of
case
where
it
is
an
action
brought
because
of
denial
of
status,
not
as
action
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
do
not
know
to
what
extent
such
argument
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
there
were
a
considerable
number
of
decisions
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
following
that
case
deciding
wrongful
discharge
cases
and
also
decisions
on
claims
under
the
agreements.
there
are
not
too
many
reported,
i
know
there
were
some,
most
of
them
probably
were
lower
court
cases.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
there
were
a
considerable
number
of
wrongful
discharge
cases
being
brought
under
moore.
i
do
not
believe
there
have
been
very
many
cases
brought
under
moore
case
on
this
theory
that
having
left
--
the
only
case,
other
case
beside
this
one
that's
referred
to
in
the
briefs
is
the
sapporo
case
which
was
decided
by
the
third
circuit.
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
a
suit
against
the
pan
american
airways
by
i
believe
a
puerto
rican
i
think
it's
been
here
before
this
court
four
or
five
times
on
certiorari.
there
was
a
problem
before
the
second
circuit
with
regard
to
a
claim
under
a
wage
contract
and
in
that
case
also
the
court
said
we
don't
see
the
distinction
between
a
suit
for
wages
and
a
suit
for
wrongful
discharge.
actually
the
record
in
that
case
that
followed
through
shows
that
mr.
sapporo
never
would
give
up
his
right
to
leave
the
statement,
so
far
as
the
courts
in
this
country
were
concerned,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record
and
refused
to
follow
the
advise
of
courts
that
he
sue
for
wrongful
discharge.
so
far
as
that
particular
stage
of
case
is
concerned
i
believe
he
is
still
is
claiming
employee
states,
and
even
under
the
theory
of
the
court
below
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
sue
in
court
for
the
wages.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
the
ex-employee
is
usually
saying
i
committed
an
offense,
but
it
didn't
merit
this
charge,
many
of
those
cases
go
to
the
adjustment
board
or
he
says
you
didn't
prove
any
offense,
i
didn't
commit
it
and
there
was
no
proof
of
it.
another
type
is,
i
was
denied
the
rights
under
the
agreement
to
a
fair
trial
or
perhaps
the
agreement
requires
that
it
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
i
committed
this,
there
are
all
sorts
of
claims.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
generally
that
is
correct.
they
affect
a
very
small
minority
of
employees.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
correct,
they
may
involve
questions
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
believe
that
is
correct,
although
i
think
i'll
leave
it
at
that
point.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black
these
claims
for
so
many
days
pay
if
taken
to
the
adjustment
board,
can
--
those
claims
can
be
awarded
to
the
petitioner
by
the
adjustment
board.
there
is
nothing
that
the
court
could
do
here
that
the
adjustment
board
could
not
do
for
the
respondent.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
would,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
section
(i)
provides
certainly
that
the
dispute
is
between
an
employee
and
an
employer
but
my
position
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
need
imply
or
expressly
state
that
the
moment
the
employee
relationship
terminates
that
dispute
terminates.
that
--
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
can
give
an
example
in
another
field,
but
to
me
it's
a
little
bit
as
though
i
have
an
agreement
with,
to
do
some
work
for
someone
and
i
have
an
agreement
that
any
dispute
while
i
am
doing
that
work
will
be
arbitrated.
i
feel
that
if
i
finish
the
work
and
then
i
have
a
dispute
over
pay
i'd
probably
–
i'm
bound
to
go
to
arbitration
on
that.
i
don't
feel
that
i
can
say
well
our
work
is
done
and
we
didn't
mean
that
finally
dispute
arose
after
i
had
done
the
work,
and
after
arbitrated,
i
can
go
to
court.
i
feel
that
congress
here
intended
disputes
which
so
affected
interstate
commerce
is
to
require
the
establishment
of
the
specialized
board
to
be
handled
by
that
board
if
they
were
disputes
which
fitted
into
that
category
and
arose
from
the
employer-employee
relationship,
while
a
man
was
an
employee
because
otherwise
you
have
the
conflict
that
congress
was
trying
to
avoid.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
well
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
to
settle
the
disputes
between
the
employers
and
the
employees.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
right.
but
i
believe
that
if
you
can
create
to
satisfaction
of
the
kind
which
can
result
from
permitting
retired,
discharged
employees
to
take
their
pay
claims
to
court
that
certainly
that
was
within
the
general
intent.
these
are
claims
arising
solely
from
the
employer-employee
relationship,
the
act
in
section
3
first
(i)
talked
about
either
party
referring
into
the
board.
and
then
the
dispute
of
course
itself
arises
from
the
employee
relationship.
the
act
permits
the
parties.
it
doesn't
say
the
employee
still
being
an
employee
taking
to
the
board.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
employer.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
i
am
accepting
--
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
my
petition
is
that
this
court
find
it
in
the
congressional
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
n.
clattenburg
may
i
point
out
one
thing
before
i
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
there
are
court
decisions
construing
agreements,
collective
agreements
to
the
effect
that
even
the
discharged
man
has
nothing
to
do
with
follow-up
procedures
of
the
act.
the
agreement
itself
says
your
only
remedy
is
reinstatement
under
this
agreement
and
there
is
a
tendency
in
the
industry
to
--
by
agreement
perhaps
to
limit
this,
what
can
happen
to
the
person
who
is
making
a
claim
under
an
agreement
no
matter
when
he
claims
it.
but
even
so
that
the
problem
which
is
raised
by
this
case
cannot
be
solved
by
hoping
that
perhaps
agreements
will
eventually
be
construed
to
reach
the
same
result
if
such
agreements
are
entered
into
by
the
employers
and
the
unions.
