mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
i'd
like
to
at
the
outset
put
this
case
somewhat
better
in
the
time
setting
that
i
think
your
honors
should
have.
the
pleadings
indicate
that
mr.
depriest
became
an
employee
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
in
the
year
1915.
i
point
out
to
your
honors
that
that
of
course
antedated
the
railway
labor
act
of
1934
and
also
the
act,
the
original
act
of
1926
and
that
at
the
time
he
became
an
employee
and
at
least
thereafter
until
1926
if
he
had
any
dispute
with
his
employer
concerning
his
right
to
be
paid
wages
or
the
construction
of
his
contract
of
employment,
he
had
one
place
to
go
and
get
his
remedy,
and
that
was
through
a
court
of
common
law
jurisdiction.
in
1926
of
course
the
railway
labor
act
was
enacted
and
we
have
now
to
consider
the
amendments
of
1934
and
the
construction
that
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
placed
up
on
both
acts.
now
in
1951
your
honors
we
submitted
three
cases
to
the
national
railroad
board
of
adjustment
which
for
practical
purposes
can
be
said
to
be
companion
cases
to
the
depriest
case.
we
submitted
them
there
only
after
we
had
filed
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
in
which
we
sought
the
judgment
and
we
went
all
the
way
after
we
were
told
by
the
district
judge
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
except
to
see
to
it
that
we
had
a
forum
for
â€“
bear
in
mind
these
cases
were
not
being
prosecuted
by
the
union.
and
that
we
must
go
to
the
national
railroad
board
of
adjustment
and
that
they
must
entertain
these
complaints
or
within
six
months
if
that
was
not
done
the
court
would
reinstate
our
complaints
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
new
jersey
and
give
us
a
forum.
so
the
three
cases,
the
opinions
in
which
have
been
called
to
your
honors'
attention,
as
appearing
in
page
9
of
the
record
here,
are
the
opinions
in
those
cases
the
pleadings
in
which
were
filed
in
1951.
and
the
cases
had
not
been
decided
when
in
1957
this
case
was
being
argued
on
the
first
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
now
in
the
mean
time
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
decided
that
shapiro
case
and
up
until
that
time
i
had
regarded
judge
maden's
decision
in
1951
as
representing
the
law
on
the
subject
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
a
court
to
entertain
a
railroad
wage
claim,
but
when
in
the
shapiro
case
i
found
that
the
first
circuit
had
decided
to
the
contrary
and
that
included
one
of
the
sitting
judges,
our
own
judge
meyers
from
the
third
circuit
i
then
wondered
if
i
hadn't
been
originally
right
in
the
first
instance.
so
i
trust
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
get
then
to
an
answer
to
the
question
you
put
to
my
adversary
as
to
whether
or
not
i
agree
that
wage
claims
generally
are
cognizable
in
court
or
whether
they
must
go
to
the
national
railroad
board
of
adjustment.
there
has
been
a
change
in
my
thinking.
as
of
now
and
since
the
decision
in
the
shapiro
case,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
a
common
law
court
has
jurisdiction
over
wage
claims
of
railroad
workers
for
otherwise
your
honors
what
happens
to
this
right
that
they
have
and
that
a
claim
for
wages
is
a
common
law
claim
cognizable
in
a
common
law
court.
law
been
known
as
such.
what
do
you
do,
with
the
right
of
the
employee
that
he
has
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
court,
and
in
a
federal
court
if
he
can
establish
diversity
of
citizenship,
wherein
has
he
given
that
away?
wherein
has
it
been
taken
away
from
him
by
a
competent
authority?
and
in
this
case,
may
i
ask,
you
have
an
employee
whose
right
of
trial
by
jury
is
involved,
whose
contract
of
employment
antedated
all
of
the
legislation
on
the
basis
of
which
it
could
be
said,
that
his
right
of
trial
by
jury
has
been
taken
away
and
a
remedy
substituted
by
his
having
the
national
railroad
board
of
adjustment
to
take
the
jurisdiction
of
his
case.
well
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i
do
not
sir,
but
what
i
say
is
this
that
irrespective
of
what
the
federal
railway
labor
act
says,
the
seventh
amendment
gives
the
right
of
a
trial
by
jury
in
that
type
of
a
case,
a
wage
case.
i
say
that
the
federal
railway
labor
act
could
not
take
away
that
right
without
violating
the
constitution.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
of
course
your
honor,
i
would
naturally
bow
to
what
you
said.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
that
was
not
what
i
thought
sir.
and
i
--
to
finish
my
answer
to
you
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
point
out
the
time
of
this
man's
beginning
of
his
employment,
only
in
emphasis
of
the
proposition
that
the
constitutional
rights
which
he
had
antedated
the
adoption
of
the
legislation
in
question.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
i
wouldn't
think
so
sir.
i
thought
it
was
a
right
that
he
would
have
and
that
could
not
be
taken
away
from
him
without
violating
the
seventh
amendment.
in
any
event,
in
learning
of
--
in
prosecuting
these
first
three
case
at
the
board,
we
found
your
honors
that
the
railroad
position
was,
that
the
tracks
over
which
mr.
depreist
or
the
three
plaintiffs
in
that
case
at
least,
were
said
to
have
operated,
were
not
the
tracks
of
a
foreign
railroad,
but
they
were
belt
line
tracks,
so
the
railroad
said
that
had
been
established
by
reason
of
an
agreement
with
the
city
and
an
ordinance
that
the
city
had
thereafter
adopted.
now
that
was
in
conflict
with
information
attained
to
us
in
a
report
by
(inaudible)
and
abbot
to
the
legislatures
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
surveying
the
delaware
river
port,
in
1948,
where
that
report
points
out
that
there
is
an
agreement
between
the
baltimore
and
ohio
and
the
pennsylvania
railroad
whereby
the
pennsylvania
will
do
the
switching
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
at
piers
98,
and
pier
100
in
south
philadelphia.
we
have
never
been
able
to
establish
the
terms
of
that
contract.
the
railroad
would
never
bring
it
forward.
we
had
no
compulsory,
and
i
point
out
to
you
sirs
that
the
act
does
not
grant
it
to
the
board,
the
right
of
a
compulsory
subpoena.
it
provides
no
right
of
or
opportunity
for
discovery.
it
provides
no
opportunity
for
cross
examination
of
witnesses,
and
the
material
that
is
submitted
to
the
board
is
not
safeguarded
by
the
necessity
of
a
supporting
oath
or
affirmation.
so
that
we
found
that
these
matters
being
very
basic
factual
matters,
being
in
dispute,
we
have
no
way
whatever
to
develop
it
or
to
get
from
our
adversaries
information
that
was
in
their
possession
and
within
their
peculiar
knowledge
or
at
least
to
explore
whether
or
not
that
was
not
so.
consequently
when
mr.
depriest
retired
this
suite
was
brought,
and
he,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
(inaudible)
pending
the
first
appeal
which
was
taken.
now
we
feel
that
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
five
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
for
this
reason.
we
filed
the
initial
pleadings
in
late
1951.
issue
was
joined
i
think
in,
sometime
in
1952.
the
cases
were
argued
either
in
november
or
december
of
1952
and
we
received
the
decisions
from
the
board
in
march
of
1957.
so
it
will
be
between
four
and
five
years.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
it
is
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
it
is.
i'm
searching
(inaudible).
may
i
point
that
the
national
policy
as
expressed
in
railway
labor
act
of
keeping
these
men
at
work,
keeping
them
at
their
posts
and
keeping
the
railroads
operating,
important
as
it
is,
is
only
relevant
to
their
right
to
able
to
see
to
it
that
they
have
an
expeditious
remedy
for
getting
their
just
compensation
and
to
the
extent
that
that's
denied
to
them
or
that
they
are
delayed
in
the
realization
of
it,
in
the
event
of
a
dispute,
the
same
national
policy
is
jeopardized.
well
now
your
honors,
we
felt
and
still
feel
that
this
suite
fits
within
all
of
the
law
that
has
been
declared
by
this
court
in
the
construction
of
the
federal
railway
labor
act.
we're
mindful
of
the
rules
that
your
honors
declared
in
order
of
railway
conductors
against
pitney,
in
order
of
railway
conductors
against
the
southern
railway,
and
in
slocum
against
the
l
&
w,
but
we
say
that
over
here
on
the
other
side
is,
the
moore
case
is
still
good
law.
in
addition
to
what
mr.
justice
black
said
about
it
when
it
was
decided
by
the
court,
he
commented
on
it
in
the
decision
of
the
slocum
case,
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
distinction,
that
the
moore
was
not
being
overruled
and
pointed
out
a
fact
that
my
adversaries
have
at
least
not
to
mentioned
at
all
during
the
litigation,
that
there
was
a
reason
for
the
distinction
between
the
two
lines
of
cases.
the
reason
being
that
when
moore
was
discharged,
he
ceased
to
be
an
employee,
and
that
he
therefore
had
the
right
to
make
an
election
as
to
whether
he
would
go
to
the
board
and
seek
reinstatement
or
avail
himself
of
his
remedies
in
the
common
law
court,
as
for
a
breach
of
his
contract
of
employment.
now
if
that
reason
is
good,
and
we
think
it
is
because
the
definition
of
the
word
employee
certainly
does
not
fit.
it
does
not
fit
the
pre-
status
after
he
retired
and
it
certainly
doesn't
fit
now
the
present
plaintiff
who
is
trying
to
settle
his
estate
and
incidentally
the
diversity
of
citizenship
has
been
perfectly
preserved
even
by
mr.
day's
appointment
as
administrator.
so
that
neither
depriest
as
retired
employee
nor
day
as
his
administrator
fits
within
this
definition
of
an
employee
that
the
statute
lays
down.
the
decision
in
the
slocum
case
in
which
the
distinction
was
made
by
mr.
justice
black
was
in
1950.
there
had
been
nine
years
under
--
of
that
rule's
prevailing.
so
as
far
as
i
know
there
has
been
no
effort,
at
least
congress
has
not
adopted
any
amendment
to
that
to
make
it
conform
to
what
my
adversaries
would
have
you
believe
was
the
intent
of
congress
if
the
congressional
intent
different
from
that
as
defined
by
this
court
in
1950.
now
they
say
well,
we
recognize
that
that
there
ought
to
be
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
discharged
man
to
continue
to
sue
at
law
but
we
think
you
ought
to
limit
to
him
alone.
well
if
that's
true
then
i
think
they
have
a
difficulty
in
explaining
how
they
can
fit
or
as
mr.
justice
douglas
put
it,
how
they
can
squeeze
the
concept
of
mr.
depriest's
position
into
the
definition
of
an
employee
because
the
definition
of
a
employee
does
not
say
that
the
board
has
--
or
rather
the
section
153
(i)
does
not
say
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction
over
disputes
which
arose
when
the
relationship
of
a
employer
and
employee
existed.
it
says
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction
over
disputes
between
an
employee
or
group
of
employees
and
a
carrier
employer,
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
notion
of
a
discharged
employee
being
able
to
go
to
a
common
law
court
is
almost
inseparable
from
the
idea
that
a
pensioned
employee
or
his
administrator
should
have
the
same
right.
now
the
cases
which
i
found
in
our
state
at
least
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
an
action
for
an
alleged
wrongful
discharge,
one
of
the
measure
--
one
of
the
issues
is
what
wages
were
owing
to
this
employee
at
the
time
of
his
discharge,
what
--
is
he
entitled
to
collect
through
us.
so
that's
embodied
in
the
remedy
that
clearly
the
man
now
has
under
the
early
case
involves
the
same
issue
that
we
are
asking
to
be
tried
â€“
it's
triable
or
may
be
triable
in
the
common
law
of
courts
also.
i
point
out
to
your
honors
also
that
the,
the
fact
that
the
moore
case
was
decided
a
long
time
ago
even
though
the
last
mention
was
discussed
in
1950
in
the
slocum
case,
but
in
1953
again
this
court
reiterated
that
rule
in
the
koppal
against
the
transcontinental
&
western
airline.
and
the
only
difference
between
the
two
cases
was
that
in
the
latter
case
this
court
found
that
it
was
necessary
in
a
reverse
to
the
action
for
a
plaintiff
to
be
able
to
show
that
he
has
complied
with
state
law
and
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies
if
the
law
of
the
particular
state
required
that.
but
otherwise
the
rule
in
the
moore
case
was
reiterated
and
adhered
to
and
the
language
i
think
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
slocum
case
was
re-quoted
exactly.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
i,
i
think
that
of
course
your
honor
realizes
that
that
the
matter
was
being
dealt
with
only
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
and
i
suppose
that
was
the
only
qualification
that
judge
kalodner
was
putting
on
because
i
know
no
other
circumstance
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
i
think
that
we
would
entitle
first
of
all
to
our
remedies
of
discovery
which
we
can't
get
any
place
else
and
i
propose
to
follow
those.
i
assume
we'd
have
an
answer
from
the
defendant
and
we'd
ultimately
get
to
trial.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
the
issues
at
the
trial
would
be
as
far
as
i
can
understand
the
factual
issues
from
the
other
cases
sir,
it
would
be
whether
or
not
the
place
at
which
this
work
was
performed
was
a
place
at
which
the
city
of
philadelphia,
pennsylvania
and
the
baltimore
and
ohio
had
agreed
where
belt
line
tracks
or
whether
they
were
tracks
solely
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
company
on
which
the
pennsylvania
did
switching
on
a
contractual
basis.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i
can't
conceive
that
it
would
be
because
i
know
of
no
issue.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
your
honor
there
are
two,
two
basic
clauses
of
the
contract
that
spell
this
out
were
included
in
the
complaint
already
filed.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i'll
point
out
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
on
page
2
of
the
printed
record,
your
honor
will
find
in
the
bottom
half
of
the
page,
sections
4a
(1)
and
402
(a)
which
goes
over
and
occupies
the
first
half
the
page
3.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
402
(a)
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
they
are
your
honor?
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i
think
they
would
have
to
be
your
honor
along
with
evidence
that
these
were
trade,
involves
trade
terminology.
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
testimony
as
to
the
meaning
of
words
in
the
trade.
and
i
think
certainly
that
as
a
guide
to
the
trial
judge
in
instructing
the
jury,
he
could
have
recourse
to
any
decision
of
the
national
railroad
board
of
adjustment
that
may
rely
on
the
subject.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
they
would.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes,
please
do
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes,
they
could.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
there
is
one
other
fact
in
there,
your
honor
should
know
and
that
is
that
most
of
the
employees
who
are
affected
in
this
area
by
this
issue
have
already
at
the
behest
of
the
union
settled
and
released
the
railroad
of
any
further
liability.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
if
it
weren't
i
think
they'd
have
the
same
right,
they
certainly
should
have.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
if
the
holding
of
this
court
is
that
only
those
who
were
former
employees
can
go
to
court
then
they
could
not
go
to
court,
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
that's
correct
sir,
because
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
the
slocum
case
that
if
such
a
thing
should
occur,
the
judgment
of
the
court
would
not
in
anyways
be
binding
upon
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
that's
right.
now
may
i
say
as
bearing
on
the
comment
that
i
think
or
the
question
that
one
of
your
honors
asked
my
adversary
along
that
same
line,
as
to
the
ability
of
judges
to
intelligently
construe
these
agreements.
the
railroad
at
least,
or
the
railroads
have
to
rely
upon
the
ability
of
the
intelligence
of
judges
to
interpret
those
agreements
because
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
washington
terminal
railroad
case,
in
the
event
that
the
railroad
is
disappointed
by
the
board's
finding,
it
can
draw
back
in
the
harness
until
the
employee
brings
an
enforcement
suit,
then
they
are
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo
before
who,
before
the
district
court
judges
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
and
they
have
to
determine
and
do
determine
the
same
questions
that
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
has
just
referred
to
and
if
the
court
determines
it
in
an
enforcement
suit,
surely
there
they
are
binding
upon
the
board.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
that's
undoubtedly
true
sir.
i'd
like
to
remind
your
honors
also
that
another
one
of
your
early
decisions
under
the
federal
railroad
labor
act
was
one
in
which
you
took
cognizance
of
the
right
of
an
individual
employee
to
sue
in
court
for
his
wages,
and
that
is
the
burley
case.
there
had
been
in
that
case
an
award
of
the
board,
but
the
--
when
the
matter
got
here
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
burley
had
ever
authorized
the
union
to
appear
before
him
at
the
board,
and
your
honors
were
being
urged
by
the
railroad
to
adopt
the
proposition
that
the
finding
of
the
board
was
final
and
binding
upon
this
particular
employee.
but
your
honors
said
that
before
you
could
discuss
the
finding
--
the
final
and
binding
policy
of
an
award
of
the
board,
you
have
first
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
valid
and
your
honors
determined
that
at
least
there
was
a
fact
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
award
and
remanded
it
to
the
district
court
in
illinois
where
mr.
burley
might
have
his
day
in
court.
i've
never
been
able
to
find
out
what
ever
happened
after
that
to
that
case,
but
at
least
here
this
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
i
know
that
sir.
i
know
how
that
was
done,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
establishing
the
fact
that
an
individual,
wage
claimant,
has
got
a
case
cognizable
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
if
there
is
diversity
of
citizenship,
i
think
that
case
still
stands
for
the
proposition
that
he
does
have
a
right
to
maintain
his
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
right
i
don't
think
it
has
any.
there
is
language
in
some
of
the
cases
that
there
is
a
right
on
his
part
to
have
some
court,
some
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
board
has
based
its
findings
upon
substantial
evidence
and
if
it
has
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
there
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
oh
no.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
no
sir
it
does
not.
the
remedies
that
the
railroad
has,
is
one
of
right,
where
they
have
a
trial
de
novo,
now
under
the
washington
terminal
case,
your
honors
decided
that
the
railroad
couldn't
initiate
that,
except
by
refusing
to
obey
the
order
of
the
board
which
compelled
the
employee
to
bring
his
enforcement
suit
and
when
he
did,
the
railroad
could
then
come
in
and
have
a
trial
de
novo
under
section
153
p,
before
a
district
judge,
as
to
any
defense
that
it
ever
had
to
the
matter.
now
if
the
employee
has
any
kind
of
correlative
right,
this
court
has
never
so
declared
it,
nor
has
any
other
that
i
know
of.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
now
your
honor,
as
your
honors
had
that
situation
in
the
siegfried
case,
in
which
application
was
made
to
your
honors
for
certiorari
and
it
was
denied,
and
that
case
is
cited
in
the
footnote
in
judge
kalodner's
brief.
the
dissenting
judge
there
in
the
fifth
circuit
described
a
very
long
odyssey,
that
this
plaintiff
had
traveled
in
an
effort
to
try
to
get
some
review
of
this
action
by
the
board,
but
up
to
now
the
circuit
courts
nor
this
court
has
not
held
that
the
employee
has
any
review
as
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
you
mean
the
fact
there
is
a
remedy
in
favor
one?
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
section
153
p
of
the
act
provides
expressly
a
remedy
of
enforcement
for
the
employee.
it
does
not
say
that
it's
a
right
of
review
for
the
(inaudible),
but
that
has
been
i
think
spelled
out
by
the
court
in
the
washington
terminal
case.
a
like
right
on
behalf
of
the
employee
has
never
been
pointed
to
by
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
trial
de
novo
â€“
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
no
sir,
your
honor
misunderstood
me.
in
the
review
under
section
153
p,
the
employee
comes
in
with
an
award
of
the
board
which
under
the
statute
is
presumptively
--
any
findings
of
fact
in
that
award
are
presumptively
true.
they
may
be
rebutted
i
take
it,
but
prima
facie
they
would
be
accepted
as
true.
the
employer,
however,
comes
in
unencumbered
by
any
binding
effect
of
this
award.
he
can
assert
any
defense
that
he
ever
had
and
the
district
court
tries
a
de
novo
with
a
right
of
appeal
and
that
was
--
that's
been
done
in
number
of
cases
in
the
third
circuit.
but
the
employee,
if
he
is
disappointed
at
the
board,
there
is
nothing
said
anywhere
in
the
act
where
he
has
any
right
of
anything
after
that.
some
of
the
cases
have
said,
and
the
elgin
case
is
an
example
of
not
so
much
of
saying
it
expressly,
but
by
spelling
it
out
of
the
courts,
of
what
the
court
did,
but
some
of
the
cases
said,
that
in
such
a
situation
a
reviewing
court
has
the
right
and
duty
to
see
whether
or
not
the
adverse
finding
of
the
board
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
i
take
it,
if
it
was
not,
then
he
has
some
sort
of
a
remedy
and
the
nature
of
that
i'm
sure
of.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
it
decided
justice
black
among
other
things,
the
same
general
principle
that
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
chicago
river
case
just
recently
that
the
board's
proceedings,
the
right
and
opportunity
to
go
to
the
board
was
not
one
which
the
employee
and
railroad
could
avail
themselves
of
or
not
at
their
option,
that
it
was
a
compulsory
thing,
but
it
also
decided
that
the
employer
had
a
right.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
the
railroad,
yes
sir,
it
had
a
right
of
the
review
other
than
by
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
here
the
railroad
had
brought
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
as
they
had
done
also
in
the
slocum
case
and
this
court
said
while
you
have
a
right
of
review.
it
is
not
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment.
your
right
of
review
is
to
disobey
the
order
of
the
broad
and
wait
until
an
enforcement
suit
is
brought.
when
that's
brought
then
you
can
assert
in
the
court
any
defense
that
you
have
ever
had
and
you
have
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
it
was
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i
did
not
get
that
from
the
case
sir.
it
maybe
that,
but
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
i
think
that's
true
sir.
i
get
the
impression
from
the
court's
opinion
that
this
plaintiff
was
unrepresented
by
counsel
and
as
his
pleadings
were
so
inartistically
drawn
it
was
difficult
for
the
court
to
understand
just
what
he
was
driving
at.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
well
i
think
sir
that
in
most
cases
of
the
suit
for
wrongful
discharge,
there
would
have
to
be
some
reliance
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
at
common
law
the
right
to
discharge
an
employee
at
will
was
the
normal
situation.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
it's
very
much
help
either
on
the
question
of
wages
except
that
the
court
says
that
they
can't
see
any
difference
between
a
suit
for
wages
and
a
suit
for
an
unlawful
discharge.
other
than
logically
i
agree
that
there
is
not
very
much
help,
but
i
do
think
that
--
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
however
that
--
the
fact
that
the
wage
issue
is
or
can
well
become
a
part
of
the
issues
of
the
discharged
case
triable
by
a
common
law
of
court
such
that
it's
likely
to
create
no
more
disturbance
than
it
does
or
has
and
the
railway
industry
certainly
indicates
that
if
this
court
would
hold
that
administrator
of
a
deceased
employee
or
a
retired
employee
were
to
bring
a
suit
for
his
wages
that
there
would
not
be
such
a
disquieting
effect
in
the
industry
as
to
violate
the
policy
of
the
act.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
m.
davis,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
we
think
your
honors
that
as
the
law
stands
now
declared
by
this
court
that
we
are
clearly
entitled
to
maintain
our
action
that
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
court
was
entirely
correct
and
that
we
are
entitled
to
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
unless
your
honors
decide
to
change
what
has
been
the
long
established
rule
of
this
court.
