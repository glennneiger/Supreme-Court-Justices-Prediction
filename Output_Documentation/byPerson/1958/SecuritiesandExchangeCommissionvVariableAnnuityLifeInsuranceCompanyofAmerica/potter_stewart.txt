in
that
connection,
has
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
supposed
to
be
--
how
are
the
mechanics
on
the
registration
under
the
1933
act
operate
under
these
so-called
policies
which
you
say
are
securities?
each
one
would
have
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
literally
that
similar?
justice
potter
stewart
are
the
two
companies
corporate
relatives
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
the
same
advertising
agent.

or
just
that,
just
on
your
last
statement.
if

if
you
should
die

that
is
while
the

what
happens
is,

your

over
your

justice
potter

but
there's
some
like

justice
potter
stewart
and
normally,
an
open-end
investment
company,
the
shares
are

are
negotiable,
you
can
buy

and

you're

they

justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand
isn't
that
quite
similar
to
some
insurance
advertising
which
depends
upon
past
experience
to
project
future
so-called
dividends
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
life
insurance.
justice
potter
stewart
so-called
dividend,
we
know
it's
not.
justice
potter
stewart
this
would
be
hard
to
gather
for
some
average
(inaudible)
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
risk
of
survival
beyond
--
the
mortality
tables
is
assumed
by
the
companie,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
it
during
your
lifetime,
if
you
--
if
you
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
the
option
you
exercise
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
you
may
exercise
in
your
lifetime.
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
that
extent,
the
--
the
company
undertakes
the
risk
of
your
surviving
beyond
the
mortality
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
that
extent,
at
--
at
least,
it
does
partake
of
--
of
the
quality
of
an
insurance
company.
you
would
have
to
conceive
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
subject
to
the
investment
risk,
always
under
this
--
under
valic.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
valic
does
undertake
in
the
events
you
exercise
this
option,
does
undertake
the
risk
of
your
survival
beyond
the
mortality,
that
--
that's
all
i'm
asking
just
for
information.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
this
--
how
does
this
differ
except
in
degree
from
the
ordinary
risk
you
take
that
the
insurance
--
that
an
ordinary
conventional
insurance
company
might
go
broke,
as
a
lot
of
them
did
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
few
decades
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
a
matter,
we're
talking
now
about
the
risk
being
shifted.
even
in
the
most
conventional
kind
of
an
insurance
company
which
sells
annuity
policies,
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
annuitants,
always
undertake
the
fundamental
risk
that
the
company
through
bad
investments
or
bad
management
is
going
to
go
bankrupt.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
does
that
differ
except
in
degree
from
the
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
worth
much
to
an
annuity,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
dorsey,
a
--
a
mutual
company
would
not
run
a
file
of
the
provision
of
section
18
of
the
investment
company
act
of
1940,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
because
you
are
a
--
a
stock
company
that
you
do.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
the
--
i
thought
it
was
because
you
have
stockholders
that
you
would,
that
you
have
stockholders
and
annuitants.
but
a
mutual
company,
the
--
the
beneficiaries
would
also
be
the
owners
of
the
company,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing.
you
emphasized
quite
correctly,
i
think,
the
--
the
extent
of
the
regulation
of
the
states
over
the
business
of
insurance,
each
state
has
very
rigorous
standards
and
a
great
deal
of
regulation,
but
doesn't
that
regulation
almost
always
invariably
include
severe
limitations
upon
the
nature
of
investments
that
insurance
companies
can
make?
justice
potter
stewart
and
pretty
much
prohibit
some
from
going
very
--
very
far
into
--
into
common
stocks
by
way
of
investments?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
--
in
that
respect
at
least,
the
district
of
columbia
regulation
is
not
typical
of
the
regulation
which
--
of
the
--
of
the
other
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
there
are
not
many
states
in
which
your
kind
of
a
company
could
operate,
are
they?
be
incorporated,
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
--
assuming
that
you
are,
what
you
say
you
are,
an
insurance
company.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcdonald
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcdonald,
just
so
--
i'm
sure
that
i
understand
your
footnote
on
page
13
to
which
you
refer
to
us
a
few
minutes
ago,
comparing
the
cash
values
of
lincoln
national,
canada
life
and
of
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
company
at
the
end
of
30
years.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
there
is,
as
a
contractual
matter,
this
basic
difference
that
in
lincoln
national
or
canada
life
or
any
of
the
traditional
kind
of
annuity
policies,
there
is
a
contractual
right
to
a
cash
value
of
a
minimum
number
of
dollars?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
that'd
be
$30,000
or
whatever.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
contractual
right
to
x
dollars
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
contrasted
to
your
company
where
there
is
a
contractual
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
nothing
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
--
in
terms
of
dollars.
