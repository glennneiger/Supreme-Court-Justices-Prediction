justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
district
judge,
if
i
gather
what
you're
arguing.
did
he
held
for
you
under
the
securities
act
and
under
the
investment
company
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
held
it
against
you
on
the
mccarran
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless
on
your
briefs,
they
filed
the
system,
mccarran
act
does
simply
more
than
a
security.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
district
court's
theory
was
that
although
it
agreed
with
you
as
to
your
position
under
the
security
act,
none
constant,
the
mccarran
act
did
something
more
which
took
these
companies
out
from
under
the
sec.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
my
point
is
that
your
first
statement
that
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
investment
company
act
or
the
security
act,
that's
dispositive.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
because
of
your
construction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
--
you're
going
to
state
at
some
point
briefly
what
the
insurance
features
of
the
contracts
were
that
he
is
referring
to
in
the
finding
93?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
it's
immaterial
to
your
argument
hereto
whether
this
valid
company
of
the
united
states
here
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there's
a
difference
--
there's
a
difference.
in
this
case,
the
question
is
not
between
regulation
or
no
regulation,
but
which
of
the
two
agencies
are
regualted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
valic
write
anything
except
these
variable
--
variable
annuity
contracts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
difference
in
the
characteristics
of
your
--
your
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
character
of
the
state
regulation
of
securities
that
can
be
dealt
in
or
purchased
with
respect
to
variable
annuity
fund
,
does
that
--
does
the
character
of
that
regulation
differ
from
the
regulations
pertaining
to
investments
of
reserve
funds
of
insurance
company
or
is
it
equally
applicable
as
to
--
equally
applicable
to
reserve
funds
as
to
investments
in
the
variable
annuity
funds?
justice
john
m.
harlan
irrespective
of
whether
it's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
that
all
the
commission
meant
in
his
footnote
was
assuming
that
you
are
right
that
this
variable
annuity
policy
is
not
subject
to
sec's
supervision
that
then
even
though
one
state
may
say
it
is
and
another
state
says
it
isn't
that
they
would
agree
in
those
circumstances
that
the
commission
can
step
in.
they
don't
--
they
surely
don't
say
that
if
new
york
says
that
this
a
variable
annuity
policy,
that
ends
a
litigation,
they've
conceded
themselves
out
of
court
on
that
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
as
a
practical
matter,
your
most
stringent
state
regulatory
language,
as
a
practical
matter,
goes
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
quite
correct
that
the
consequence
should
be,
if
you
didn't
comply,
you
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
business
in
the
more
stringent
state.
