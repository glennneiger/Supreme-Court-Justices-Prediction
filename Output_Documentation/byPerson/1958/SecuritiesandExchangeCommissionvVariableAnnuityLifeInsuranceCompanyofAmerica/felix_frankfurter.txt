that's
because
of
your
construction
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this,
also
out
of
ignorance.
assuming
that
there
is
this
clothes,
almost
identical
completely,
it's
pictorial
identity,
i
see
a
lot
of
things
that
catch
a
child's
eye
(inaudible)
does
this
follow
that
because
united
fund
has
registered
for
the
securities
positions,
that
it
must.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
did
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
are
you
saying,
because
of
the
financial
or
security
contents
of
the
enterprise
representations
of
valic,
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
for
which
public
protection
was
sought
to
be
accorded
by
the
securities
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
familiar
court
must
have
held
it's
not
insurance
within
their
regulatory
system
for
failure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
other
state
may
construe
their
insurance
law
incase
judges
below
stand
to
cover
this
factor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
question
of
justice
black
put
is
acceptable.
the
answer
that
this
is
--
if
this
is
referred,
the
sec
regulates
in
(inaudible)
versus
state
regulation
such
as
there
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
all
the
abstract
fears
that
were
entertained,
the
securities
act
and
the
investment
act,
authority
to
bring
ruins.
securities
of
--
of
the
country
have
been
found
to
be,
either
be
advised
clearly
and
security
dealers
themselves
now
welcome
the
kind
of
regulate
known
throughout
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
--
you
know
of
the
--
speaking
of
teachers'
annuity,
you
know
the
carnegie
annuity?
do
you
know?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
--
from
what
you've
said
(inaudible)
has
not
been
subjected
to
regulation
or
has
not
been
deemed
by
the
securities
commission
subject
to
the
investment
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
you
whether
or
rather
to
what
extent,
whatever
that
the
variable
annuity
is
comparable
to
the
terms
of
the
carnegie
teachers'
annuity,
under
which
i
don't
know
how
many
professors
and
teachers
hold
their
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
securities
and
to
what
extent
they
are
different
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
otherwise
--
otherwise
--
assuming
the
otherwise
is
important
or
unimportant,
whichever
you
assume,
otherwise
there
was
identity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
the
--
the
college
annuity
fund,
whatever
it's
called,
i
forget
i
was
once
a
beneficiary,
a
(inaudible)
beneficiary,
is
not
exquisitely
exempted
from
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
category
to
which
it
could
be
said
to
belong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
they
--
have
they
actually
ruled
on
the
college
retirement
fund
category
or
has
it
assumed
--
has
it
been
assumed
that
it
doesn't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
scope
of
allowable
investment
the
same,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
in
which
--
the
kind
of
thing
they
can
carry
in
their
portfolios?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
college
retirement
is
also
operating
in
the
district,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
destroy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
destroy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
the
commission
agrees
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
a
state
--
a
state
conducted
enterprise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
raise
another
question.
(inaudible)
which
i'm
ignorant,
namely,
whether
state
--
state
investment,
what
might
be
deemed
to
fall
under
the
term
of
the
investment
act,
falls
on
(inaudible)
if
conducted
by
the
state.
i
don't
know.
maybe
the
answer
is
clear
that
it's
subject
to
the
act.
but
it
may
raise
a
different
question.
in
other
words,
whether
--
whether
the
investment
act
was
swept
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
securities
commission,
state
enterprise.
i
--
i
don't
know.
there
maybe
already
answer
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
it
might
be
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
respected
authors
dealing
on
insurance
law
have
support
your
position.
do
these
authors
to
which
you
give
references
use
specifically
with
your
type
of
--
of
enterprise
or
arrangement?
i
use
those
neutral
terms
to
avoid
expressing
a
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
an
old
classic
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
referred
in
your
brief,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
deal
specifically
with
your
annuity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
bear
--
it
may
bear
the
practical
argument
on
policies
that
laid
behind
the
legislation
and
the
consequence
is
evil
or
good
of
making
one
construction
rather
than
another
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
one
agrees
that
it's
an
insurance
policy,
i
suppose,
mr.
meeker
wouldn't
be
arguing
here.
that's
the
whole
controversy,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
equally
true
of
the
corporations
issuing
the
securities
which
are
controlled
by
the
securities
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
so
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
that
proposition
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
a
single
--
determination
by
a
single
insurance
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
determines
the
--
the
status
of
a
character
throughout
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
--
does
the
commission
say
that?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
precondition
of
that
proposition
is
that
it
was
an
insurance
within
the
terms
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
mean
--
you
don't
mean
that
the
determination
by
the
new
york
superintendent
of
insurance,
i
see
a
very
admirable
young
lawyer
who
has
just
been
appointed
to
that
position
in
new
york,
does
that
mean
that
his
determination
to
the
--
to
the
document
is
an
insurance
rather
than
an
annuity
and
insurance
rather
than
investment
is
controlling
upon
the
construction
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
means
that
--
that
the
determination
of
a
single
state
agency
may
determine
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
an
insurance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
that's
your
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
an
insurance
--
an
insurance
enterprise
on
the
new
york
law
by
the
new
york
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no
state
agency
determined
you
to
be
an
insurance
company
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
you
could
if
you
chose
to
rest
yourself
on
one
proposition.
what
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
if
--
if
you
chose,
if
lawyers
would
say,
“i
would
base
my
whole
proposition,
my
whole
case
on
a
single
argument,”
you
could
say
west
virginia
and
district
of
columbia
had
determined
we
are
an
insurance
company
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter
and
sit
down.
i
mean,
you
could,
as
a
matter
of
logical
argument,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
brief
is
that?
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
what
page
please?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
saw
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
you
were
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
wondering
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
you
--
do
i
understand
that
limitation
of
west
virginia
to
be
a
finding
by
that
authority,
by
the
commissioner
in
west
virginia,
whatever
he
is
called
that
that
is
true
of
your
operations
throughout
the
country,
not
merely
with
reference
to
what
you
write
or
the
annuity
you
issue
in
west
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
total
findings
are
based
on
your
total
operations
and
not
merely
as
allocated
to
west
virginia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcdonald,
do
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
is
quite
so?
does
it
mean
that
or
it
doesn't
mean
you
may
not
be
allowed
to
do
business
in
that
particular
state
on
concept
that
other
states
may
have
lack
standard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
most
--
you
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
business
in
that
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
could
continue
to
do
business
in
47
other
states
if
they
let
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
this
whole
line
of
argument
is
legally
rather
irrelevant
because
if
you're
out
of
the
statute,
whether
the
states
choose
to
regulate
you
effectively
is
none
of
the
federal
government's
business.
if
you're
within
the
statute,
then
the
effective
regulation
is
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
contingency
only
whether
you'd
make
3.5%?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
--
in
the
old
line
company,
participating
dividends
which
affects
what
he
may
allow
to
aggregate
to
his
annuities
is
also
contingency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
advertised
news,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
morning's
paper,
that
was
advertised
news,
not
only
news
but
advertised
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
it
--
may
i
ask,
time
is
short,
whether
the
fact
that
the
annuity,
the
amount
of
dollars
and
cents
a
fellow
gets
is
entirely
contingent
as
against
the
old
line
fixed
dollar
amount,
whatever
the
dollar
may
shrink,
is
that
very
decisive
in
your
view
that
differentiating
this
thing,
it's
not
an
--
it's
not
as
investment,
not
an
insurance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
they
--
that
they
couldn't
--
that
particular
thing,
i
like
to
tell
(inaudible)
that
that
they
couldn't
change,
they
kept
on
making
a
fixed
(inaudible)
contingent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
first
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
if
you
will
let
me
and
asked
whether
assuming
they
make
disclosure,
assuming
they
satisfy
the
securities
act,
could
they
write
merely
by
making
the
disclosure
that's
an
annuity
policy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
to
say
they
--
that
what
we
call
one
of
the
two
decisive
feature
making
this
not
an
insurance
would
be
presumed
once
they
registered
as
an
investment
company.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?

justice
felix

all
right.
thank
you.
