mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
chief
justice.
if
the
court
will
indulge
just
--
just
a
moment,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
some
charts
that
--
if
the
court
pleases.
we
have
passed
since
we
think
it
might
be
of
some
convenience
to
the
court,
a
pamphlet
containing
the
various
policies
that
are
involved
in
this
matter,
although
they're
all
in
the
printed
record
at
the
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
much
more
assessable
to
pass.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
may
have
passed
them
after
quite
--
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
last
time
i
have
the
privilege
of
arguing
before
this
court,
our
commission
had
only
lost
once
before
below.
in
the
instant
case,
we
have
had
the
unfortunate
experience
of
having
lost
twice
below.
although
we
lost
the
war,
we
did
win
a
rather
significant
battle
in
the
course
of
the
campaigns
in
the
courts
below.
it
is
to
that
only
victory
that
i
shall
advert
first,
because
i
believe
that
the
determination
by
judge
wilken
in
the
united
states
district
court
that
the
deferred
variable
annuity
policy
and
incidentally,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
in
so
far
as
valic
and
ealic
are
concerned,
it
is
plainly
stipulated
in
this
record
that
the
policies
are
the
same
and
may
be
considered
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
the
same.
that
this
deferred
variable
annuity
policy
which
is
found
in
the
record
at
pages
567
to
578
in
which
mr.
earnest,
counsel
for
the
respondents,
has
tendered
to
the
court
is
offered
and
sold
by
the
respondents,
ealic
and
valic,
as
an
investment
contract
inspite
of
the
trimmings,
the
toga
or
appearance
that
it
gives
of
being
something
other
than
that,
an
insurance
contract
as
respondents
claim
that
it
is.
it
is
our
contention,
thus
that
this
is
a
security
that
is
being
sold
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(1)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
that
those
companies
which
are
selling
them,
ealic
and
valic,
are
investment
companies
within
the
purview
of
the
investment
company
act
of
1940.
and
we
believe
that
judge
wilken's
finding
was
and
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
all
of
the
facts
of
the
record
in
light
of
the
pertinent
statutes
herein
involved.
it
is
our
contention
further
that
the
contracts
that
are
being
offered
and
sold
are
not
insurance
within
the
intendment
of
section
3
(a)
(8),
the
exemption
section
of
the
securities
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
he
held
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
he
held
against
us
under
the
mccarran
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
and
i
plan
in
this
argument,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
deal
solely
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
security
or
i
believe
that
to
be
dispositive
of
this
entire
case.
my
colleague
for
petitioners,
mr.
dorsey,
will
deal
with
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
insurance
and
deal
more
completely
with
the
question
of
section
3
(a)
(8).
but
i
shall
confer
in
my
labors
here
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
what
is
being
offered
and
sold
here
is
a
security.
it
was
also
necessary
to
the
finding
of
the
court
or
the
necessary
result
from
the
finding
of
judge
wilken
that
valic
and
ealic
--
because
what
they
were
offering,
he
found
was
a
security,
were
not
predominantly
engaged
in
the
business
of
writing
of
insurance
as
is
provided
in
the
exemptive
language
of
the
investment
company
act,
section
3
(c)
thereof.
furthermore,
it
is
our
position
as
i've
just
indicated
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
at
all.
that
if
this
court
is
persuaded
to
our
view
that
this
is
a
security,
if
that's
dispositive
of
the
issue,
if
this
court
is
persuaded
contrary
wise
and
agrees
with
the
respondents,
that
likewise
disposes
of
the
issue.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
that
is
correct.
but
we
contend
that
this
is
a
security
and
not
insurance
in
any
event,
therefore,
the
mccarran
act
cannot
apply.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
and
we
don't
agree
with
that
position
as
will
be
argued
here
later.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
that's
my
view
of
the
case,
sir.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
district
court
judge
dismissed
our
--
the
commission's
complaint
in
an
opinion
in
which
he
concluded
at
page
94
of
the
printed
record
that
in
view
of
the
language
and
history
of
the
mccarran
act,
such
contracts
as
--
are
being
sold
by
these
companies
and
the
companies
are
subject
only
to
the
regulation
of
the
insurance
departments
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
several
states
in
which
they
were
qualified
to
do
business,
where
such
companies
are
licensed
to
do
business.
and
it
was
his
judgment,
the
judgment
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
finally
that
congress
only
can
make
such
contracts
in
such
companies
ameanable
to
the
securities
laws
--
securities
act
of
1933
and
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
in
this
case.
now,
judge
wilken
made
five
fundamental
findings
of
fact,
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
this
honorable
court's
attention
to
sec
versus
howey
at
328
u.s.293
and
particularly
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
dissent
from
that
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
appellate
court
below
in
that
particular
case
were
not
able
to
find
an
investment
contract
and
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
administration
and
the
judicial
propriety
or
understanding
that
he
could
not
go
along
with
the
majority
in
the
howey
case
which
found
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
offering
of
units
in
that
case
of
citrus
fruits
that
there
was
an
investment
contract.
judge
wilken
and
the
district
court,
may
it
please
this
court,
made
these
specific
findings,
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
them,
because
he
heard
the
witnesses.
he
saw
the
contracts.
he
tried
the
case
for
10
days
and
he
made
extraordinarily
careful,
preliminary
and
conclusive
findings.
the
first
finding
he
made
that
is
conclusive
in
my
view
is
finding
49
at
record
108.
the
risk
of
profit
or
loss
on
investments
is
born
by
the
contract
holders.
and
i
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
because
the
court
is
mindful,
i'm
sure,
that
in
the
conventional
insurance
policy,
the
risk
once
the
premium
is
paid,
the
first
premium
is
paid
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
ensure
ability,
the
risk
of
loss
in
the
conventional
policy
is
on
the
company.
in
the
ealic
and
valic
situations,
the
risk
of
loss
remains
with
the
purchaser
throughout.
the
second
finding
that
was
made
by
judge
wilken,
a
valic
and
ealic
contract
holder
invest
money
with
the
respective
defendants
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
pardon
me,
your
honor,
it's
finding
74
at
record
109
to
110.
“a
valic
and
an
ealic
contract
holder
invest
money
with
the
respective
defendants
with
the
hope
or
expectation
that
a
profit
will
accrue
to
him
as
a
result
of
the
management
of
a
portfolio
of
securities
purchased
by
valic
and
ealic
with
the
money
invested
by
the
contract
holder
and
his
expectation
of
profit
based
upon
the
efforts
of
others,
applies
to
both
the
accumulation
period
and
to
the
repayment
or
variable
annuity
period.”
the
third
finding,
finding
93
at
record
111,
“the
insurance
features
of
such
contracts
do
not
alter
the
investment
characteristics.”
now,
we
concede
that
there
are
insurance
features
to
these
contracts,
there
are
a
number
of
standard
clauses
which
appear
in
insurance
contracts,
but
we
maintain
that
basically
and
fundamentality,
this
court
must
look
at
what's
being
offered
and
sold
here
in
terms
of
what
it's
represented
to
be,
what
the
--
the
companies
selling
it,
used
by
way
of
inducement
to
induce
purchases
to
buy
it
and
that
by
all
standards
and
by
the
tests
set
by
this
very
court
in
joiner
and
howey,
this
court
can
come
to
know
other
conclusion.”
i
respectfully
suggest
if
it
follows
the
test
in
joiner
and
howey,
about
what
is
being
sold
here
inspite
of
the
insurance
toga
is
nothing
less
than
an
investment
contract
and
interest
in
a
pool
of
securities
and
expectation
of
a
profit
from
a
pool
of
securities
at
some
time
in
the
future
with
all
of
the
risk
throughout
resting
upon
the
purchaser
who
gets
none
of
the
protections
which
the
purchaser
or
securities
gets
when
the
registration
process
under
the
securities
act
results
in
a
prospectus
being
delivered
to
him
either
before
or
at
the
time
of
the
consummation
of
a
sale
of
a,
what
is
known
as
the
honorable
certificate
of
stock
or
security.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
will
leave
that
to
my
colleague,
mr.
dorsey,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
the
fourth
finding
which
i
would
respectfully
call
to
the
court's
attention
is
number
94.
“the
distinguishing
and
predominant
nature
of
a
variable
annuity
is
found
in
its
provision
for
sharing
profits
and
loses
in
a
common
fund
to
be
invested
mainly
in
common
stocks.”
now,
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
chart
which
i
--
we
have
prepared
and
copy
--
had
been
given
to
counsel
and
copies
will
be
available
to
the
court
--
for
its
use
if
so
desired
later.
on
the
left
is
valic,
on
the
right
--
and
the
court
will
find
the
prospectus
of
this
fund
in
the
record,
is
a
typical,
mutual
fund.
valic
was
organized
through
a
private
sale,
and
thus,
did
not
fill
the
regulation
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
at
the
time
it
was
initially
organized.
and
it
not
organized
itself
through
a
private
sale
or
through
some
other
exempt
route.
it
would've
had
defiled
a
registration
statement
if
it
had
made
a
public
offering
of
its
own
securities
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
licensed
by
the
insurance
commissioner
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
many
other
insurance
companies
every
year
will
go
to
the
capital
markets
for
money
by
filing
a
registration
statement
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
subsequently,
after
being
authorized
to
do
business
to
the
district
of
columbia,
valic
would
again
and
this
would
apply
equally
to
ealic,
was
authorized
to
do
business.
i'm
not
saying
that
ealic
is
necessarily
authorized
to
do
business
in
the
same
state,
but
i'm
using
valic
for
the
purpose
of
illustration.
authorized
to
do
business
in
west
virginia,
kentucky,
arkinsas,
alabama
and
new
mexico.
now,
valic
claims
that
this
is
insurance.
but
let
us
take
a
look
at
the
comparison
between
a
typical
mutual
fund
registered
under
the
investment
company
act,
complying
through
the
registration
process
under
the
securities
act
of
1933
for
which
there
is
a
prospectus
regularly
available
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
shares.
let
us
compare
it
with
valic
which
claims
to
be
an
insurance
company.
valic
offers
seven
types
of
policies.
all
policies
involve
accumulation
and
annuity
units.
the
accumulation
unit
refers
to
the
value
of
the
shared
or
in
the
paying
period
and
the
annuity
unit
refers
to
the
value
computed
on
a
slightly
different
basis
of
the
payout
period.
either
periodic
or
immediate
purchases
of
units

be
made.

now,
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
portfolio.
what
happens
to
the
premiums
paid
in
the
valic
case
by
the
so-called
policy
holder
who
we
think
is
the
purchaser

the
one
who,

the
basic
portfolio
here,
very
interesting
in
terms
of
the
representation
made
in
exhibit
21
in
the
sales
literature
which
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
very
interesting.
here,
as
of
05-31-57,
the
last
information
available
in
the
record,
it
would
appear
that
bonds
and
other
debt
securities
account
for
about
16%
of
the
portfolio.
i
beg
the
court's
pardon.
some
--
somewhere
as
in
the
making
of
the
charts,
the
figures
were
reversed
on,
it's
just
the
other
way
around,
it's
84%
and
i
hope
the
court
will
notice
this
because
i
will
try
to
see
that
they're
all
correct.
that
it's
84%
for
bonds
and
other
debt
securities
as
of
05-31-57
and
16%
for
preferred
stocks
and
common
stocks
as
of
the
same
date.
now,
the
units
to
which
the
purchaser
here
becomes
entitled
must
necessary
flow
from
the
appreciation
and
earnings
of
this
portfolio.
and
as
i
will
call
to
your
honor's
attention
shortly,
it's
represented
by
valic
that
its
investment
is
in
the
equity
securities
of
american
industry
and
this
is
their
sales
literature,
it's
their
sale's
kit
and
yet,
the
record
speaks
for
itself.
now,
in
the
united
funds,
there's
a
diversification
of
assets,
pretty
largely
in
equity
securities,
and
since
i
am
not
relying
on
the
sales
literature
of
united
funds,
i
made
no
effort
to
get
a
breakdown
as
of
that
date.
finally,
finding
number
5,
anyone
desiring
to
make
economic
provision
--
give
me
the
judge's
findings
--
for
the
future
can
buy
an
investment
trust
certificate
from
a
securities
company
or
investment
broker
and
also
by
an
annuity
policy
from
an
insurance
company
or
in
--
can
now
buy
a
variable
annuity
contract
from
valic
or
ealic
which
will
provide
at
one
instrument
for
both
investment
and
insurance
benefits,
hope
that
the
variable
annuity
will
carry
no
fixed
dollar
benefits
and
therefore,
while
serving
as
a
hedge
against
the
ill-effects
of
inflation
will
not
provide
any
assurance
against
the
effects
of
deflation.

call
it,
insurance
policy
as
respondents
call
it,
was
a
hybrid
as
judge
wilken
had
suggested
it
was
or
in
other
words
that
it
had
some
features.
although
the
court
never
went
so
far
as
to
say
it
had
some
features
of
a
security,
it
said
that
it
had
some
features
of
this
economic
experimentation,
this
novel
economic
experiment
which
we
happen
to
think
as
a
security,
but
it
also
said
that
it
had
so
many
more
features
in
effect
that
looked
like
the
traditional
insurance
policy
that
it
was
compelled
to
conclude
that
this
was
really
having
been
--
these
companies
having
been
licensed
by
the
insurance
commissioner
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
taking
a
look
at
section
3
(a)
(8)
which
mr.
dorsey
will
deal
with
and
together
with
this
insurance
features
very
briefly
shortly.
that
court
concluded
that
this
was
not
within
the
ambit
of
regulation
permitted
to
us
and
taken
out
from
under
us
by
section
3
(a)
(8).
it
is
apparent
as
i
have
suggested
that
the
--
these
contracts
do
look
a
lot
like
the
conventional
policies,
and
mr.
earnest
has
tendered
the
court
as
i've
suggested,
the
copies.
and
if
the
court
looks
at
them,
the
court
will
find
that
they
do
look
like
conventional
policies,
but
if
the
court
takes
a
look
at
them,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
consider
the
possibility
of
the
impact
of
the
disclosure
provisions
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
with
the
registration
statement
in
their
prospectus
on
something
like
this.
i'm
reading
now
from
page
573
and
particularly
number
18
which
talks
about
net
investment
rate
and
net
investment
factor.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i'm
reading
from
the
principle
policy
in
issue
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
didn't
have
mr.
earnest's
quote,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
it's
number
18
of
the
first
policy,
it's
entitled
“net
investment
rate
and
net
investment
factor.”
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
plaintiff's
exhibit
1,
deferred
variable
annuity
policy,
it's
provision
18,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
i
would
just
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
good
deal
of
illumination
and
light,
not
apparent
with
sale's
literature
knowin
that
clause
would
be
thrown
upon
what
a
purchaser
was
buying
here
in
valic,
is
the
full
impact
of
the
disclosure
provisions.
the
statute
and
the
rules
and
regulations
thereunder
is
administered
by
our
commission.
in
connection
with
the
33
act,
we're
brought
to
bear
upon
these
contracts,
so
that
the
purchaser
would
have
a
better
idea
of
what
he
was
really
buying.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
variable
annuities
should
not
be
sold.
we
contend
merely
that
these
contracts
must
be
registered
under
the
securities
act.
there's
a
lot
of
misinformation
about
this.
there
are
words
about
s.e.c.trying
to
destroy
a
new
economic
experiment.
we
have
no
intention
of
doing
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
it
would
be
much
like
a
registration
statement
--
well,
it's
gone
now
--
for
the
united
fund.
and
i
could
submit
to
the
court
if
the
court
would
like
to
see
a
prospectus
which
would
show
just
how
these
shares
are
fully
described
in
--
in
a
prospectus
foreign
investment
funda
and
it
would
be
the
same
sort
of
thing.
it
would
give
the
pertinent
business
some
financial
facts.
one
thing
it
would
give,
it
would
give
a
little
bit
more
than
this
chart
gives.
there's
valic
over
here,
this
is
valic
sales
kit.
it
says
basic
american
industries,
why
did
it
diversified,
what
managed
carefully.
and
within
each
industry,
the
diversification
of
companies.
now,
i
had
a
colleague
of
mine
count
the
eggs
over
here.
the
number
of
eggs
in
this
industry
passes
to
the
same
as
we
are
over
here
in
the
united
fund
sales
literature,
this
is
the
united
fund
sales
kit,
this
is
valic
sales
kit.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
yes
sir.
the
only
difference
is
right
here.
now,
let
me
take
you
one
step
further
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
valic
sales
kit.
this
is
united
fund
sales
kit.
the
only
difference
between
these
two
and
these
two
is
that
western
union
is
in
yellow
here
and
it's
in
white
over
there.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
have
no
knowledge
of
their
kinship.
i
believe
that
they
are
not
corporate
relatives,
but
my
recollection
is
that
the
man
who
designed
this
sales
literature
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
testified
in
the
district
court
or
at
least
he
was
in
the
picture
somewhere.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
no,
your
honor
and
i
don't
make
any
such
contention.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
my
contention
is
this,
that
this
honorable
court
in
the
joiner
and
the
howey
cases
has
said
in
effect
of
the
several
test
in
determining
whether
a
particular
document
or
a
particular
program
constitutes
in
investment
contract.
and
one
of
the
test
which
the
court
here
has
established
is
the
manner
in
which
what
is
being
offered
is
represented
and
this
is
merely
submitted
to
indicate
to
this
court
the
manner
in
which
this
is
being
represented.
and
if
i
may
answer
just
a
bit
more,
as
of
may
31st,
1957
in
connection
with
the
percentages
which
i
offered
the
court,
which
i
suggested
there
were
84%
bonds
and
16%
securities
in
the
portfolio.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
united
fund.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
mr.
mcdonald,
is
quite
correct.
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
perhaps
i
inadvertently
overlooked
it,
but
on
the
bottom
of
the
chart,
you
will
find
sec
docket
number
--
number
818-105-1-2,
united
fund
ealic
sales
kit
pages
613
and
614.
this
is
an
official
record
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
i
have
felt,
may
i
submit
to
the
court
perfectly
at
liberty
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
a
public
record
of
a
government
agency.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
i'll
--
i'll
be
happy
to
give
that
information
just
a
moment.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
in
any
event,
the
point
i'm
making
is,
that
this
is
the
kit
that's
used
by
the
salesman
and
the
agency
representatives
of
valic
to
sell
these
contracts.
it
shows
a
number
of
major
american
corporations
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
point
to
which
i
referred
to
earlier,
it
had
in
its
portfolio
only
five
of
these
securities.
now,
in
fairness,
i
must
say
that
as
far
as
united
fund
is
concerned,
the
united
fund
at
the
time
when
we
checked
this,
did
not
have
15
of
these
that
were
listed
because
it's
perfectly
proper
that
--
that
you
go
in
and
out
if
you're
in
an
investment
fund,
as
the
united
fund
did
and
as
valic
appears
to
be.
that
you
have
--
have
to
engage
in
trading
and
securities.
that's
what
makes
you
an
investment
fund
in
part
under
the
investment
company
act.
and
so,
it's
not
surprising
that
that
is
what
takes
place.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
purchasr
is
getting
this.
he
looks
at
this
and
thinks
that
this
is
what's
in
the
portfolio.
and
i
am
not
doing
this
for
the
purpose
of
establishing,
and
perhaps
there
are
misrepresentations
here,
i
thought
i'm
understood
in
that.
we
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
amend
our
complaint
at
the
district
court
level
and
i've
forgotten
that.
i
am
doing
this
to
point
out
how
this
is
represented
because
i
think
that's
crucial
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
an
investment
contract.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
it's
of
no
consequence
to
me,
united
is
--
only
make
great
points,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
finally
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
no,
this
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
this
merely
shows
a
similarity
in
operation
which
goes
to
what
i
considered
to
be
under
the
joiner
and
the
howey
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
criteria
which
this
court
must
employ
in
examining
something
which
is
not
just
plainly
our
certificate
of
stock
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
an
investment
contract
under
section
2
(1)
or
perhaps
a
certificate
of
a
profit
sharing
agreement
under
section
2
(1).
whichever
the
court
might
say,
i
say
it's
an
investment
contract.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
am
saying
that
--
yes,
sir,
i'm
saying
that.
and
i'm
also
saying
that
in
order
to
determine
why
we
have
pecan
orchards
that
are
being
sold
in
units
and
the
orchids
are
being
serviced
and
we
have
a
question
as
to
whether
there's
an
investment
contract.
here,
they're
not
selling
pecan
orchards
or
a
church
but
they
are
selling
what
appears
to
be
an
insurance
policy.
and
i
say
to
this
honorable
court
that
in
determining
whether
it's
a
security
as
we
maintain
it
is
that
the
very
sales
methods
that
they
employ,
the
manner
in
which
they
represent
this
security,
is
one
of
the
things
which
this
court
should
consider
in
determining
whether
it's
within
section
2
(1)
as
an
investment
contract
as
we
claim
it
to
be.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
oh,
i'm
not
making
it.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
right
away
your
honor,
i
will
cease
talking
about
it
because
it
was
only
used
for
purposes
of
illustration.
in
essence,
what
we
claim
is
that
under
the
howey
and
joiner
cases,
the
test
established
there
--
what's
being
sold
here
is
an
investment
contract.
the
person
invests
his
money
in
a
common
enterprise
and
is
led
to
expect
profits
solely
from
the
efforts
of
a
promoter
or
a
third
party,
and
that's
sec
versus
howey
at
328
u.s.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
may
i
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor
that
our
commission
has
experienced
not
only
in
dual
regulation
at
the
federal
level,
but
also
at
the
federal
and
state
level.
the
federal
--
the
company
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission,
are
not
treated
as
if
they
were
orphans
in
our
organization.
we
respect
the
fact
that
they're
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission,
therefore,
we
accept
by
rule
adopted
after
public
hearing,
an
opportunity
for
comment.
we
accept
something
less
in
the
way
of
accounting
standards
from
those
companies
than
we
expect
from
companies
that
are
merely
subject
to
our
jurisdiction
to
no
other.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
very
great
american
companies,
some
87
of
them
during
the
last
year,
filed
under
the
securities
act
offering
securities
to
the
public.
having
so
filed,
they
are
required
to
file
reports
under
section
15
(d).
they
have
to
file
the
same
financial
reports
that
a
listed
company
has
to
file.
they're
subject
to
regulation,
to
that
extent
right
now.
this
is
just
one
step
for
move
because
there
are
--
not
only
this
company
is
actually
selling,
as
we
claim,
an
investment
contract.
well,
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may,
i
only
have
45
minutes
all
at
all,
sometime
for
rebuttal,
if
the
court
pleases
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
my
principal
point
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
security,
and
the
howey
and
joiner
don't
sustain
this
and
we
can't
persuade
either
that's
it,
then
we
better
fold
up
and
go
home.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
thank
you,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
preamble
to
section
3
notes
very
clearly
that
as
i
believe
i
remember
it,
the
following
classes
of
securities
are
exempt
and
then
3
(a)
(8)
is
included
as
one
of
those
classes
of
exempt
security.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
--
left
to
me,
i
would
like
to
make
one
or
two
references
to
certain
remarks
that
have
been
made
by
my
distinguished
colleagues
for
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
i
believe
our
brief
concedes
that
if
they
come
within
the
investment
company
act,
that
there
will
certainly
be
problems
that
they
will
have
to
resolve
with
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
don't
believe
it
would
put
them
out
of
business.
i
think
the
thing
can
be
worked
out,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
think
that
--
that
--
as
section
60
of
the
act
implies
and
provides
for
in
fact
that
they
can
present
their
peculiar
problems
to
the
commission
and
seek
some
exemptive
treatment.
but
if
they
are
an
investment
fund,
if
they
are
selling
a
security,
they
should
be
treated
like
everybody
else
that's
selling
a
security.
it
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
would
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
two
main
things
that
are
decisive.
i'd
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
but
if
they
would
come
in
and
register
and
disclose
what
they're
doing
and
comply
in
the
sale
of
a
security
like
anyone
else
who
is
selling
a
security,
that's
the
answer
to
this.
in
the
first
instance,
there's
--
there's
an
innuendo
here
throughout
both
oral
argument
and
written
argument
that
the
securities
act
is
a
regulation
similar
to
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
or
the
investment
company
act.
securities
act
is
a
disclosure
act.
what
we
want
to
do
--
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
there
is
a
problem
there.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
there
is,
of
course,
an
exemptive
power
that
the
commission
has
to
make
it
--
to
make
--
after
all,
we
--
this
is
not
the
first
time,
your
honors,
that
we
have
been
faced
in
the
five
years
i've
been
at
the
commission
with
the
problem
of
how
to
treat
with
what
appears
to
be
a
new
security.
for
example,
american
depository
receipts
which
are
traded
in
quite
extensively
in
new
york.
the
commission
came
along
and
adopted
a
special
form
of
registration
statement
to
make
it
possible
for
banks
in
new
york
and
still
have
protection
for
investors
in
new
york
to
trade
in
receipts
which
were
receipts
or
evidence
of
an
interest
in
securities
which
are
sold
abroad
wholly
and
which,
as
in
european
practice,
have
no
--
no
identifying
numbers.
they're
just
bare
instruments
and
so
you
can't
tell
from
time
to
time
who
holds
these
securities,
but
the
commission
met
that
problem
after
hearings
and
conferences
with
a
special
form.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
--
i
can't
answer
that
definitively.
in
the
first
place,
any
decision
that
the
commission
would
make
on
this
would
be
made
in
its
quasi-judicial
or
rule
making
areas
and
i
couldn't
commit
the
commission.
i
would
say
this
to
your
honor
that
the
pattern
of
the
investment
company
act
plus
the
flexibility
and
the
willingness
of
our
people
to
try
to
--
to
meet
new
problems
as
they
come
along
make
it
only
possible
for
these
companies
to
come
before
our
agency,
try
administratively
first
and
then
by
application
to
take
the
same
--
to
seek
the
same
exemptive
treatment
that
other
companies,
from
day-to-day,
are
coming
before
us
for.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
well,
may
i
say
what
the
two
are.
in
the
first
place
--
oh,
my
time
is
up.
if
i
may
finish
this.
i
think
the
risk
of
loss
is
equally
as
important.
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
salutary
thing
that
would
occur
from
not
only
registration
under
the
securities
act
but
registration
under
the
investment
company
act
is
one
that
there
would
be
disclosure
as
to
what
it
was
they
were
investing
in.
and
two,
what
it
--
what
their
actual
experience
is.
and
three,
they
would
have
to
disclose
in
advance
into
perspectives
what
their
investment
policies
are
before
they
go
seeking
purchaser
for
one
of
these
documents.
mr.
thomas
g.
meeker
i
have
been
there
five
years.
i've
read
mr.
loss'
remarks
and
i've
heard
the
remarks
about
cref.
cref
is
a
very
different
situation.
i
know
of
no
exemption.
i
know
of
no
ruling.
i
was
the
first
man
to
give
a
letter
of
opinion
on
whether
a
variable
annuity
was
a
security,
and
i
gave
it
to
the
national
association
of
investment
companies.
it
was
used
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i'd
say
this
in
all
modesty,
the
claimant
was
used
to
help
defeat
the
bill
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
very
good
note
in
the
new
york
university
law
review
volume
33,
january
1958
which
will
clear
up
once
and
for
all,
all
of
the
confusion
that's
been
generated
here
about
what
really
happened
in
new
york.

thomas

oh,
page
76,
i'd
say.
