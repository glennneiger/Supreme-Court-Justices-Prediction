mr.
john
h.
dorsey
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i'd
like
as
an
open
statement
to
answer
a
question
by
justice
harlan
on
the
question
of
regulation.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
regulation.
the
issue
is
as
to
whether
the
contracts
here
involved
are
securities,
subject
to
the
securities
acts
or
are
they
insurance?
regulation
will
flow
from
that
determination.
the
pivotal
issue
in
this
case
is
--
are
variable
annuity
contracts
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
used
undefined
in
the
securities
act,
the
investment
company
act
and
the
mccarran
company
act.
no
provision
of
these
acts
conferred
or
attempted
to
confer
upon
state
insurance
commissioners,
the
power
to
make
and
enforce
an
interpretation
of
this
federal
laws.
such
a
power,
we
submit,
is
a
judicial
one
which
can
be
exercised
by
the
courts
alone.
unless
these
variable
annuity
contracts
are
in
fact
insurance.
the
exemptions
in
the
securities
acts
for
insurance
and
annuity
contracts
are
not
available
to
respondents.
the
acts
make
this
clear.
after
defining
the
term
“security”
in
the
securities
act
and
the
very
next
provision
of
the
act,
section
3,
the
act
exempts
classes
of
securities.
listed
under
the
classes
of
securities
exempted
in
section
3
(a)
(8),
are
insurance
and
annuity
contracts.
it
is
to
be
noted
that
insurance
is
not
excluded
from
the
definition
of
a
security
or
by
denomination
in
the
statute
itself,
insurance
as
a
security.
we
then
turn
to
the
investment
company
act.
the
investment
company
act
defines
an
issuer
as
one
who
has
issued
or
has
outstanding
securities.
valic
needs
that
test.
it
then
defines
an
investment
company
as
one
investing,
reinvesting,
holding
or
trading
in
securities
and
proposes
to
acquire
securities
having
a
value
of
40%
or
more
of
its
assets,
valic
admits
that
it
needs
that
test.
valic
claims
they
are
exempt
from
the
investment
company
act
under
section
3
(c)
(3)
which
states
that
not
withstanding
the
definition
of
investment
companies
above
insurance
companies
are
exempt.
but
the
congress
was
very
careful
to
define
the
term
insurance
company.
obviously,
so
that
by
merely
being
chartered
as
an
insurance
company,
you
could
not
avoid
or
evade
the
provisions
of
this
act.section
2
(a)
(17)
of
the
investment
company
act
defines
in
--
of
the
investment
company
act
defines
insurance
company.
one
of
the
indispensible
conditions
which
must
be
met
to
qualify
as
an
insurance
company
is
that
the
company's
primary
--
i'll
quote
now,
“primary
and
predominant
business
activity
is
the
writing
of
insurance
or
the
reinsuring
of
risk
under
written
by
an
insurance
company.”
now,
in
the
event
that
these
valic
contracts
are
not
insurance,
then
valic
is
not
exempt
under
section
or
under
the
definition
of
the
investment
company
as
contained
in
section
3
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
investment
company
act
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
the
way
this
contract
--
had
divided
into
two
parts,
the
variable
annuity
contract
is
separate
--
inseparable
from
the
insurance
which
they
do
write.
it
is
required
of
any
purchaser
of
one
of
these
contracts
that
if
he
is
in
insurable
risk
and
meets
their
medical
standards,
he
must
take
out
simultaneously
with
the
variable
annuity
of
five-year
decreasing
term
insurance.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
five-year
decreasing
term
insurance
which
is
--
and
its
total
face
amount
in
the
first
year
is
five
times
the
yearly
payment
made
by
the
contract
holder
and
it
diminishes
20%
each
year
down
to
the
fifth
year
when
it
is
zero.
that
is
through
insurance,
we
do
not
deny
it.insofar
as
this
contract
is
concerned,
now,
both
lower
courts
have
found
out
it's
such
a
de
minimis
part
of
these
variable
annuity
contracts
that
are
--
is
immaterial,
especially
as
this
made
clear
within
the
specimen
contract
before
this
court
which
provides
for
a
yearly
payment
by
the
contract
holder,
the
valic,
of
a
$1000
for
thirty
years.
only
$100
of
that
$30,000
would
go
for
the
payment
of
this
five-year
decreasing
term
insurance.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
the
explanation
is
found
in
their
rate
book.
but
if
you
will
look
on
the
first
page
of
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
1,
you
will
notice
that
under
the
death
benefits,
schedule
of
life
insurance,
the
amount
shown
is
$4800
the
first
year,
38,
40
the
second,
and
so
on
down
to
the
fifth
year
when
it
--
after
the
fifth
year,
it
becomes
zero.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
i
--
i'm
unfamiliar
with
the
one
i
have
but
i
can
give
you
the
exact
record's
page
number.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
it
is
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
--
page
567
of
the
record.
now,
the
way
to
add
is
--
the
way
this
is
computed,
your
honor.
under
the
specimen
contract,
a
contract
holder
agrees
to
pay
$1000
a
year.
from
that
$1000
a
year,
is
deducted,
the
cost
of
insurance.
and
incidentally,
he
may
also
get
a
permanent
and
total
disability
insurance,
and
that
too,
we
conceive
to
be
true
insurance
under
the
specimen
policy
that
amounted
to
$39.40
a
year.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
five-year
decreasing
term
insurance.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
no.
well,
the
actual
figures
are
found
in
their
rate
books.
they
subtract
from
the
thousand
dollars,
the
premium
cost
for
the
five-year
decreasing
term
insurance
if
included.
also,
the
premium
cost
or
permanent
and
total
disability
if
included
and
then
resulting
to
that
amount
is
what
they
call
the
base
annuity
premium
--
premium.
and
that
base
annuity
premium
times
five
is
--
is
the
face
amount
in
the
first
year
of
the
five-year
decreasing
term
insurance.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
the
provision
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
very
well,
your
honor.
the
provisions
of
the
contract
fortunately
are
not
in
dispute.
that's
--
this
contract
was
analyzed
by
russell
hooker
who
for
28
years
with
actuary
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
in
analyzing
the
contract,
he
used
charts
and
graphs
which
are
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
let's
take
this
$960
here
after
the
payment
of
insurance.
all
of
that
$960,
valic
takes
a
loading
tracker
which
is
52%
the
first
year,
12%
the
next
five
years,
11%
up
the
11th
year
and
8%
whatever
year
after
that,
that
is
their
loading
track.
after
they
subtract
the
cost
of
the
insurance
and
after
they
subtract
their
loading
cost,
the
balance
that
is
left
is
invested
in
an
investment
fund
exclusively
managed
to
operate
it
and
controlled
by
valic.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
they
advertise
equities,
common
stocks
not
withstanding
if
they've
advertised
consistently
common
stocks,
their
sales
literature
has
been
disseminated
on
that
basis.
a
year
and
a
half
after
they
were
in
operation,
only
16%
was
in
common
stock
and
the
other
84%
was
still
on
the
ventures
and
bonds.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
roughly
speaking,
i
think
under
the
specimen
contract,
out
of
$30,000
of
total
payments
paid
in
somewhere
between
20
and
$25,000
goes
to
buy
eloquent
shares
in
an
investment
fund.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
under
the
exchange
act
of
1934
as
passed
at
that
time,
it
provided
only
for
regulation
of
the
exchanges,
securities
transactions
and
exchanges.
after
it's
passed,
it's
the
congress
had
found
that
a
great
field
of
security
transactions
had
not
been
covered,
namely
the
over-the-counter
transactions
which
cover
all
transactions
not
on
--
actually
handled
on
in
exchange
even
though
stock
may
be
listed
on
it.
so
senator
maloney
introduced
a
bill
to
cover
this
ill
that
had
to
be
corrected.
the
congress
was
faced
with
the
proposition
whether
or
not
they
would
increase
the
size
of
sec
so
as
to
police
this
over-the-counter
market,
or
whether
they
would
set
up
some
form
of
what
they
call
cooperative
regulation.
i
think
those
are
the
exact
words
used
by
senator
maloney
whereby
the
congress
in
effect
delegated
to
so
called
national
securities
associations
in
certain
congressional
delegations
of
power
to
police
the
over-the-counter
market
subject
to
review
of
theirs
disciplinary
actions
et
cetera
by
the
sec
and
the
courts.
under
that
act,
the
nasd
is
required
to
pass
fund
fair
and
equitable
practices,
misleading
practices,
et
cetera
over-the-counter
transactions.
if
this
is
a
security
and
it's
being
sold
outside
of
an
exchange
as
it
is,
it
is
an
over-the-counter
security
transaction.
and
in
the
disciplining
of
it
--
of
its
members
as
of
the
present
time,
nasd
would
not
know
whether
to
discipline
one
of
its
members
who
sold
this
contract
because
of
the
representations
that
--
which
are
made
concerning
its
sale.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
no.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
no,
no,
that
is
not
so.
and
answering
the
--
earlier
question,
sec
only
has
jurisdiction
over
its
members,
i
mean
nasd
only
has
jurisdiction
over
its
members.
and
it
has
to
meet
a
certain
membership
test
on
geographically
and
in
numbers
and
set
up
certain
standards,
all
of
which
have
to
be
approved
by
the
sec
whether
or
not
should
be
become
this,
national
securities
organization
depends
upon
approval
of
the
sec
of
--
of
all
the
things
you
have
to
do
as
provided
by
statutes.
there
are
about
two
or
three
pages
of
congressional
specifications
of
what
a
national
securities
association
has
to
do.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
i
--
there's
no
regulation
by
--
this
only
concerns
the
sale
of
securities,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
and
sir,
if
the
sec
loses
here
in
some
states,
maybe
the
insurance
commissioner.
in
other
states,
for
example
connecticut
which
passed
upon
this,
the
only
other
court
that
passed
upon
it,
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
held
this
is
not
insurance.
and
in
that
case,
it
would
probably
be
a
no
man's
land.
in
that
case
where
an
insurance
--
a
state
insurance
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
the
sec
would
regulate
it,
but
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
oh,
no.
the
sec
would
regulate.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
no,
your
honor.
we're
--
we
--
we
don't
care
who
sells
securities.
we'd
love
to
have
the
insurance
companies
come
in
sell
security.
our
position
is,
anybody
who
sells
a
security
as
to
form
of
the
same
law,
rules
and
regulations
and
everyone
else
itself.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
even
necessarily
so,
as
to
whether
you'd
be
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
or
you
may
be
to
this
extent.
the
--
the
type
of
--
of
sales
literature
which
is
used
by
valic
could
not
be
employed
by
anybody
subject
to
the
securities
act.
for
example,
if
you'll
take
exhibit
number
19
of
the
--
incidentally,
i
just
got
another
one
of
this
through
the
mail
the
other
day,
so
they're
still
being
distributed.
you
will
see
on
there
retirement
with
protective
purchasing
power.
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
about
retirement
with
protective
purchasing
power,
there's
no
such
thing
guaranteed.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
we
--
we
certainly
do
not
want
to
be
competing
with
people
who
are
selling
our
product
and
they
are
not
subjected
to
the
same
law
that
we
are.
we
think
the
rules
of
a
road
ought
to
be
the
same
for
everybody.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
now,
that
was
correct.
[laughter]
along
those
same
lines
i
quote
from
the
house
committee
report
on
the
bill
that
became
the
securities
act.
“no
honestly
conceived
in
an
intelligently
worked
out
offering,
floated
in
a
fair
but
not
exorbitant
profit,
will
be
injured
by
the
revelation
of
the
whole
truth
which
these
requirements
seek
to
a
list.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
that's
right.
the
predominant
nature
of
a
contract
is
that
it
is
an
investment
contract.
this
insurance
feature
is
nothing
new
in
the
securities
field.
when
the
sec
made
its
investigation
of
insurance
companies
pursuant
to
direction
of
the
congress
under
the
public
holding
company
act,
and
they
got
into
this
periodic
payment
plans
and
that's
what
this
is,
a
periodic
payment
investment
plan.
they
found
out
that
often,
this
periodic
payment
plans
had
a
little
insurance
attached
showing
no
--
take
away
the
--
to
take
care
of
those
people
who
didn't
want
to
go
into
the
stock
market
and
give
them
the
impression
that
they
were
getting
insurance.
that
goes
back
historically.
that's
reported
in
the
--
in
the
reports
before
the
congress.
getting
back
to
the
--
the
argument
which
i
hadn't
completed
on
the
investment
company
act.
if
it
is
not
an
investment
company,
i
mean,
if
it
is
not
an
insurance
company
within
the
definition
of
an
insurance
company
has
set
forth
in
the
investment
company
act
then
the
congress
says
that
the
exemptions
of
3
(a)
(8)
--
3
(a)
(8)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
that's
in
exemption
for
insurance
and
annuity
contract,
is
not
available
and
i
quote,
“to
any
security
of
which
an
investment
company
is
--
is
an
issuer.”
therefore,
a
finding
that
this
is
an
annuity
contract
will
not
suffice,
a
finding
has
to
be
made
that
this
is
insurance.
if
it
is
not
insurance
under
the
investment
--
under
the
investment
company
act,
then
this
people
are
not
entitled
to
the
exemptions
of
3
(a)
(8)
of
the
securities
act.
now,
concerning
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
it
is
to
be
noted
that
that
--
the
exemptions
provided
by
that
act
are
limited
expressly
and
i
want
to
quote
to
this
because
the
act
uses
it
seven
times
and
nothing
else
"to
the
business
of
insurance”.
it
does
not
exempt
insurance
companies.
therefore,
if
it
is
not
insurance,
it
follows
that
it
cannot
be
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
annuities
are
not
within
--
i
don't
think
i
made
that
statement.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
oh,
an
annuity
can
be
insurance
or
that
--
not
necessarily.
you
could
have
an
annuity
created
under
a
will.
but
the
annuity
that
is
provided
for
in
this
exemption,
the
exemption
provides
for
an
exemption
of
insurance
and
annuity
contracts.
the
investment
company
act
says,
“if
you're
not
an
insurance
--
if
you're
not
an
insurance
company
within
our
definition,”
that
is
your
primary
and
predominant
business
in
the
writing
of
insurance.
if
you're
not
that,
then
even
the
exemptions
in
3
(a)
(8)
are
not
available
to
you,
if
you
sell
that
security
which
--
again,
the
congress
denominates
insurance
and
an
annuity
contract
as
security.
now,
in
--
to
follow
through
on
justices
--
justice
black's
inquiries,
it's
just
what
you
get
for
this.
way
--
for
example,
suppose
you
had
$500
net
after
their
loading
charges
and
paying
for
your
insurance,
that
$500
would
be
divided
by
the
then
current
value,
asset
value
of
an
--
what
they
call
an
accumulation
which
is
really
a
sharing
in
investment
fund
and
you
would
buy
that
many
shares.
now,
under
the
specimen
contract,
that
would
run
for
30
years.
the
price
of
those
shares
will
fluctuate
by
valic's
operation
in
control
of
this
investment
fund
which
they
say
that
they're
going
to
invest
in
equities
by
which
the
contract
doesn't
say.
the
contract
doesn't
even
require
them
to
do
any
investing,
but
their
literature
says
they
will
invest
it
in
equities.
each
month,
you
buy
so
many
shares,
they
are
credited
to
your
account.
form
that
point
on,
you
keep
buying
additional
shares
each
time
you
make
a
payment.
now,
you
cannot
forsee
from
the
time
you
start
buying
these
shares
to
--
you
get
to
a
maturity
date
or
take
a
cash
value,
what
the
value
of
those
shares
are
going
to
be
or
how
many
shares
you
will
have
acquired
in
that
time?
now,
this
--
this
period
can
run
from
date
of
birth
to
age
70
years
and
you
have
no
obligation
to
enter
into
the
variable
annuities
or
pay
out
phase
of
the
contract.
there
is
no
mortality
feature
concerning
this
accumulation
period
at
all.
it
was
agreed
by
all
the
expert
witnesses
by
both
parties
and
by,
so
found
by
the
lower
court.
now,
if
you
elect
at
some
time
between
the
ages
of
50
and
70
to
go
into
this
variable
annuity
phase
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
if
you
die
during
that
period,
you'll
get
the
cash
value
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
--
which
--
which
is
the
number
of
shares
you
have
times
the
value
of
the
share
as
of
the
time
it's
redeemed.
now,
valic
holds
itself
up
like
any
open
end
investment
company
to
redeem
shares
during
this
period
at
any
time.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
and
--
and
the
--
it's
the
number
of
shares
you
hold
times
the
current
cash
value
of
those
shares
at
that
time.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
yes,
but
one
one
of
the
provisions
of
an
open-end
investment
company
is
that
the
company
has
to
hold
itself
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
--
ready
to
redeem
at
all
times.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
now,
this
is
a
little
closer,
but
they
do
hold
themselves
out.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
if
you
died
during
the
first
five
years
and
if
you
had
that
insurance.
now,
you
have
to
remember
that
insurance
is
not
necessary.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
only
if
you're
insurable
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
no,
it's
not
an
--
if
you
are
insurable
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
--
they
require
you
to
take
this
five-year
term
decrease
--
the
five-year
decreasing
term
insurance.
if
you're
not
insurable,
they
will
sell
you
the
bare
annuity
--
variable
annuity
policy.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
or
go
between
61
and
70
years
of
age,
you
cannot
buy
the
insurance,
you
have
to
buy
the
variable
annuity.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
the
record
shows
that
they
have
never
--
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
it
has
--
does
not
show
they
have
ever
sold
any
other
type
of
insurance.
their
rate
book
indicates
that
other
types
of
term
insurance
are
available,
but
up
to
the
time
of
trial,
no
such
other
types
of
insurance
evidently
had
been
sold.
other
sale
literature,
if
you
look
at
that,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
with
this
term
insurance,
it's
--
it's
all
on
the
basis
of
what
you're
going
to
--
holding
out
to
them
the
hope
of
profit.
now,
here's
the
type
of
thing
that
appears
in
their
sales
literature.
this
is
at
page
752
of
the
record,
“the
following
shows
what
would
have
been
the
results
of
the
purchase
of
a
$10,000
single
premium
life
annuity
at
age
65
in
1940.
it
assumes
that
the
individual
lived
his
normal
expectancy
and
drew
annuity
payments
until
his
death.”
then
they
have
a
table
over
here
showing
what
a
fixed
dollar
annuity
would
pay
and
what
valic
--
a
valic
annuity
would
have
paid.
down
here
in
the
fine
print,
they
say
they
base
and
standard
enforced
averages.
valic
can
never
--
felt
in
futural
at
any
time
whether
or
not
your
investment
will
result
in
a
gain
or
a
loss.
this
is
a
totally
misleading
--
it
would
be
a
misleading
and
false
under
the
securities
act
because
they
have
assumed
that
the
portfolio
that
they
selected
would
meet
the
averages
of
standard
and
poor.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
an
insurance
dividend
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
yes.
we
know
that's
a
--
a
misnomer.
however,
in
an
insurance
policy,
you
are
guaranteed
to
be
paid
upon
the
contingency,
the
loss
that
you
incur,
you're
guaranteed
that.
now,
whether
or
not
you
get
a
dividend
is
solely
up
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
insurance
company
and
that's
dependent
upon
their
--
not
only
their
investment
experience
but
their
mortality
experience,
technological
age
and
all
that
--
all
that
type
of
things.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
all
right.
i
got
an
indication
that
insurance
company
literature
is
not
very
closely
checked.
i
think
this
is
too,
the
sales
literature
here
is
an
indication
that
it's
not
very
closely
checked.
now,
in
this
--
thousands
accumulation
period
which
anyone
would
admit,
i
think,
is
similar
to
an
investment
company
periodic
payment
plan.
now,
this
become
insurance
if
a
contract
holder
elects
to
go
into
the
annuity
period,
the
variable
annuity
period.
now
as
to
the
rights,
mr.
juctice
black,
if
they
have
in
the
variable
annuity
period,
the
company
guarantees
only
one
payment
for
the
total
capital
contribution
of
the
contract
holder,
which
capital
contribution
is
the
number
of
accumulation
unit
shares
he
holds
times
their
value
at
the
time
of
election.
and
among
--
if
he
cannot
foresee
that
inception
of
the
contract
in
which
maybe
greater
or
less
than
the
amount
he
paid
in
depending
on
the
investment
experience.
for
each
$1000
so
paid
in,
the
valic
guarantees
the
contract
holder
a
first
monthly
payment
of
something
less
than
$10
per
thousand,
computed
on
the
progressive
annuity
table
at
3.5%.
now,
on
a
fixed
annuity
from
that
period
forward,
that
same
monthly
payment
would
be
made.
not
so,
under
this
contract.
in
this
contract,
the
total
amount
of
the
first
monthly
payment
there
and
that's
the
only
guaranteed
payment,
is
divided
by
then
current
value
of
an
annuity
unit.
and
portion
of
that
division
is
a
number
of
annuity
units
which
are
credited
to
your
account.
any
payments
after
that
date
are
depending
upon
valic's
investment
experience.
there
is
no
guarantee
of
any
payment
after
that
date.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
if
the
stocks
go
down,
the
risk
of
that
is
born
by
the
contract
holder
not
by
valic,
by
the
contract
holder
and
the
court
so
found,
the
lower
court.
the
risk
--
the
risk
of
loss
and
the
hope
of
gain
are
all
at
the
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
three
or
four
insurance
commissioners,
they
are
chartered
here
and
they
have
three
or
four
other
states
in
which
they
are
chartered
and
they
argue
the
question
of
comparative
regulation.
i
don't
think
that's
a
matter
that
were
concerned
with
the
regulation
flows
from
what
if
these
contracts
are
in
their
illegal
character.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
the
risk
of
--
what
the
company
does
is
by
a
specific
provision.
they
say,
“we
will
pay
you
the
value
of
these
units
as
determined
by
our
investment
experience
during
the
term
of
the
contract.”
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
maybe
your
lifetime
or
joint
survival
or
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
the
three
(inaudible)
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
yes.
but
the
risk
that's
involve
in
an
annuity,
the
insurable
risk
of
an
annuity
is
a
loss
you
suffer
from
the
--
by
survival
for
months
and
months
in
this
particular
instance
after
a
certain
date.
and
an
insurance
company,
you're
indemnified
for
that
loss
in
a
fixed
amount
as
for
the
contract.
and
this,
that
loss
is
not
shifted
to
valic,
you
still
are
subject
to
that
loss
because
you
may
get
no
payments
because
of
investment
experience.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that's
right.
they
agree
to
pay
whatever
the
value
of
a
unit
is
for
that
period
of
time.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
but
they
don't
say
the
--
the
unit
will
have
any
value
or
great
value.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
you
take
that
risk.
in
other
words,
you
continue
subject
to
the
risk
of
loss
pertaining
to
that
survival
from
month
to
month
because
valic
--
and
although
valic's
plan
may
prove
a
profitable
one
for
you,
you
will
--
like
in
every
venture,
you
also
have
to
take
the
chance
that
you
may
get
nothing.
and
therefore,
you're
not
assured
that
during
this
term
of
the
contract,
you
will
have
a
fixed
independable
income
during
this
term
of
the
contract
for
which
you
have
sought
protection.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
in
answer
to
that
question,
a
--
an
ordinary
insurance
company
can
become
insolvent
because
of
an
investment
risk
alone.
this
company
can
never
become
insolvent
because
of
investment
risk
alone.
that
risk
is
shifted,
they're
not
born
invested
in
the
so-called
contract
holder.
valic
can
never
become
insolvent
because
of
its
investment
risk.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
he
does
take
that
risk.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
in
the
--
the
conventional
insurance
company,
even
if
it
becomes
insolvent,
it
is
still
legally
obligated
to
pay
the
amount
which
it
has
assured.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
they're
not
--
[laughter]
no,
but
in
every
commercial
contract
that
i
can
think
of,
you'll
always
run
the
risk
that
one
of
the
parties
made
through
insolvency
become
unable
to
perform
his
contract.
now,
that's
the
very
reason
why
reserved
systems
have
been
established
in
the
insurance
field
because
before
the
famous
(inaudible)
investigation
in
1912,
we
all
know
what
happened.
our
reserves
are
set
up
so
as
to
avoid
exactly
what
you
spoke
about,
justice
stewart,
to
assure
that
the
insurance
company
will
have
on
hand,
sufficient
funds
to
pay
off.
it's
the
risk
of
loss
which
it
had
assumed
as
they
occur.
now,
insofar
as
law
can
make
so,
insurance
--
i
think
there's
less
risk
of
insolvency
than
almost
any
other
type
of
commercial
contract.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
that
--
you
only
--
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
you
have
assets,
but
that
risk
is
born
by
the
insurance
company,
i
mean
that
--
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
if
they
go
insolvent,
policy
owner
by
the
contract,
face
that
risk.
mr.
john
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
i've
exhausted
my
time.
