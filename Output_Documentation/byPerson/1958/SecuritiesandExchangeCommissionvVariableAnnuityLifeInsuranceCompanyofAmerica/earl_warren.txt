(inaudible)
to

chief

mr.
meeker,
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
meeker,
what
does
--
what
does
it
prove
if
we
agree
that
those
two
are
identical.
there's
a
many
traditional
interpretation
of
what
united
funds
is
or
anything
of
that
kind
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
cause
us
to
say
for
the
--
if
--
if
the
united
funds
who's
--
who's
required
to
do
this
if
the
valic
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
automatic
or
it
did
it
that
the
valic
must
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
what
does
it
establish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
case
to
the
--
the
howey
or
the
joiner
cases
hold
that
a
company
that
--
that
operates
just
as
united
funds
here
is
within
the
securities
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
--
i'm
talking
aobut
the
relation
to
it
why
you
make
that
your
major
premise,
these
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
all
you've
talked
about,
the
--
the
similarity
between
the
two.now,
i
want
to
know
just
what's
significant
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dorsey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
reading
from
this
document
now?

mr.
dorsey,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
you
have,
sir.
very
well.
all
we
know
is
the
aggregate
time
you
have
on
your
side.
so
who
is
next
in
--
chief
justice
earl

oh,
another
dorsey.
[laughter]
very
well.
mr.
dorsey
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
the
beneficiaries
in
the
college
retirement
fund
and
in
this
--
in
this
company
that
you
represent
assume
the
risk
of
loss
in
the
same
degree,
in
the
same
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
please
state
the
difference
between
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that's
somewhat
important.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
mean
the
beneficiaries
of
--
to
the
beneficiaries,
each
assume
the
risk
of
loss.
as
i
understand
it,
the
people
who
--
who
abide
these
annuities
assume
some
risk
of
loss
in
your
company,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
i'd
like
to
know
is,
do
they
assume
the
same
risk
of
loss
under
this
--
this
college
retirement
fund
and
if
--
if
not,
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let's
just
don't
take
the
end
result
because
there's
some
variables
in
here
from
time
to
time.
are
those
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
use
any
--
any
name
you
want,
but
i'm
speaking
about
the
individual
who
--
who
purchases
a
unit
or
--
or
a
policy
or
an
annuity
or
whatever
you
may
choose
to
call
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
about
the
loss
on
--
on
investments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
the
--
is
the
college
retirement
fund
regulated
as
insurance
or
as
a
corporation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dorsey,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ask
you?
is
this
a
new
incursion
of
--
of
insurance
business
into
the
investment
field
or
is
this
something
that
has
--
has
gone
along
for
a
period
of
time
and
if
so,
has
there
been
any
effort
on
the
part
of
sec
to
bring
it
--
bring
this
principle
under
control
of
the
sec?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
there
has
been
no
effort.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
the
only
one
that
you
revert
to
my
question?
is
the
wisconsin
practice,
the
only
one
that
you
cite
as
being
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
has
that
continued?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
if
a
--
if
a
stock
company
could
not
get
a
license
to
do
business
in
a
--
in
a
state
certainly
to
the
fact
that
--
that
it
was
permitted
by
the
district
of
columbia
to
do
so
and
not
authorize
them
to
sell
these
annuities
and
these
other
states,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
license
in
place
where
you
have
conformed
to
the
--
to
the
state
laws
so
far
as
your
financial
structure
is
concerned,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
understand
you,
mr.
dorsey,
to
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
if
--
if
a
state
authorizes
a
company
to
do
business
as
an
insurance
company
that
the
sec
can
have
no
jurisdiction
regardless
of
what
kind
of
business
that
--
that
company
transacts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
it
--
whether
it
is
actually
insurance
or
investment
or
whatever
it
might
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcdonald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
quite
a
substantial
difference,
isn't
it,
as
to
whether
the
--
the
policyholder
assumes
the
investment
risk?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
25-year
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
35.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
then
what
--
what
does
his
annuity
amount
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
he's
65?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
suppose
though
that
you
bought
them
wisely
or
--
or
suppose
that
we
had
depression
and
some
kind
and
your
securities
fell
off
and
it
--
it
was
a
very
great
departure
from
--
from
the
way
you
projected
it
here,
the
policyholder
would
bear
that
loss,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
65?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
earnest.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
meeker.
