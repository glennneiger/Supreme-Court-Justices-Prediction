mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
if
your
honor
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
if
your
honor
please.
despite
similarity
of
the
names,
we
are
in
quite
the
opposite
side
of
the
case.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
product
of
the
life
insurance
industry
is
insurance
because
it
assumes
and
distributes
an
insurable
risk.
this
is
as
true
of
the
variable
annuity
as
it
is
--
as
it
is
true
of
any
insurance
policy
issued
by
any
company.
the
insurable
risk
in
the
variable
annuity
is
the
risk
of
excessive
longevity.
as
the
court
of
appeal's
said,
“if
everyone
were
to
die
at
the
time
predicted
by
a
mortality
table,
there
would
be
no
use
in
paying
an
insurance
company
to
dollar
out
one's
funds.
however,
no
one
knows
when
he
will
die
and
the
insurance
product
which
guarantees
him
an
income
for
life,
regardless
of
how
long
that
life
may
be
is
the
annuity.”
and
investment
risk
on
the
other
hand
is
not
an
insurable
risk
and
whether
annuity
payments
vary
with
investment
experience
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
they
are
annuities.
a
variable
annuity
is
an
annuity.
this
fact
has
been
determined
by
the
insurance
superintendent
and
legal
authorities
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
several
states.
this
fact
was
agreed
to
by
all
expert
insurance
witnesses
testifying
at
the
trial.
this
fact
is
agreed
to
by
the
three
leading
authors
of
life
insurance
textbooks.
this
fact
has
been
agreed
too
by
the
two
courts
below.
this
fact
has
been
accepted
by
the
internal
revenue
service
which
classifies
a
variable
annuity
as
an
annuity.
this
fact
finally
was
accepted
by
petitioners
when
they
did
not
challenge
finding
of
fact
number
30
made
by
the
district
court.
finding
of
fact
30
which
is
in
the
recorded
at
page
100
says
that
a
variable
annuity
issued
by
these
respondents
is
an
annuity.
a
variable
annuity
is
an
annuity
because
it,
like
all
other
annuities
and
unlike
any
other
economic
device,
provides
a
lifetime
income
over
the
life
span
of
a
group
of
annuitants
in
accordance
with
scientific
actuarial
principles.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
concede
this
is
the
proper
definition
of
an
annuity
that
states
that
whether
or
not
an
annuity
shall
be
regulated
by
the
commission
depends
upon
the
degree
of
investment
risk
born
by
the
individual
policy
holder.
variable
annuities
which
assume
no
investment
risk
have
been
available
for
years
for
persons
in
the
teaching
profession
and
for
the
benefit
of
many
large
corporations.
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
has
made
variable
annuities
available
to
many
thousands
of
teachers
and
professors
in
the
united
states
without
challenge
from
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
the
immediate
participation
guaranteed
annuity
which
guarantees
no
investment
assumption
to
the
policy
holder
is
sold
by
many
of
the
best
known
life
insurance
companies
in
the
united
states.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
number
of
teachers
covered
is
now
in
excess
of
40,000.
historically,
mr.
carnegie
decided
that
many
teachers
in
the
united
states
were
not
adequately
compensated
in
their
retirement
period.
consequently,
around
about
the
end
of
world
war
i,
the
teachers
insurance
and
annuity
association
was
founded
in
new
york.
this
association
called
tiaa
paid
fixed
dollar
annuities
to
teachers
and
professors
in
the
united
states
that
wanted
to
participate
by
the
universities
in
this
plan.
during
the
period
of
the
1920s
and
1930s,
they
found
that
many
teachers
and
professors
had
been
reduced
to
gentile
poverty
because
the
fixed
dollar
payments
were
insufficient.
therefore,
mr.
carnegie
came
along
and
gave
them
some
more
money.
and
subsequent
to
that
time,
they
decided
that
there
was
no
reason
why
and
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
agreed
with
them
that
a
companion
corporation
called
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
could
not
be
set
up.
now,
what
a
teacher,
who
elects
to
participate
in
this
plan,
receives
today
is
one
half
of
these
premiums
that
are
put
into
a
fixed
dollar
annuity.
that's
called
the
tiaa.
the
other
half
is
put
into
a
variable
annuity,
which
is
called
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
--
equities
fund
or
cref.
the
distinguishable
element
between
the
variable
annuity
sold
by
these
respondents
and
the
tiaa-cref
plan
is
that
in
that
plan,
you
must
have
both
simultaneously,
that
is
you
must
have
a
fixed
dollar
annuity
and
a
variable
annuity
if
you
so
desire.
you
may
not
have
the
variable
annuity
without
the
fixed
dollar
annuity.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
not
quite,
your
honor.
in
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
variable
annuity,
they
do
not
assume
any
expense
guarantee.
these
respondents
do.
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
assumes
no
mortality
guarantee.
they
merely
distributed
over
the
group,
whereas
we
do
assume
from
the
moment
a
policy
has
written
the
mortality
guarantee.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
no,
sir.
the
commission
in
its
reply
brief,
i
believe,
states
the
case
in
this
manner
that
because
you
have
to
have
a
fixed
dollar
annuity
or
along
with
your
variable
annuity
from
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
that
somehow
makes
a
difference.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
the
subject.
however,
as
my
understanding,
which
is
subject
to
correction,
if
proper,
from
counsel
for
the
commission,
that
the
matter
of
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
and
its
possible
relationship
to
the
securities
act
was
discussed
with
the
commission
along
about
the
time
in
1952
when
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
was
established.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
no,
your
honor.
we
assume
the
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
it
is
whether
or
not
the
same
risk
of
loss
is
assumed
by
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
is
assumed
by
respondents.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
we
call
that
insured.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
they
assume
the
same
risk
of
loss,
the
risk
of
loss
being
the
end
of
benefits
upon
death.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
they
assume
the
same
risk
of
loss,
the
risk
of
loss
being
the
end
of
the
annuity
payments
or
benefit
upon
the
death
of
the
insured.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
your
honor's
question
used
the
word
“beneficiary”.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
in
the
accumulation
period
which
is
basically
the
same
in
either
case,
in
the
college
retirement
equities
fund,
the
annuitant
has
no
cash
surrender
value.
all
respondents
and
other
commercial
insurance
companies
are
required
by
law
to
have
a
cash
surrender
value.
in
the
college
retirement
equities
fund,
they
do
not
guarantee
what
the
expenses
of
the
equities
fund
will
be.
they
merely
find
what
they
are
and
then
spread
them
across
the
group.
conversely,
in
our
case,
we
do
guarantee
what
maximum
expenses
will
be.
and
if
the
expenses
exceed
that,
that
is
the
risk
of
the
stockholders
and
not
the
policy
holders.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
the
investment
risk,
your
honor,
which
is
not
an
insurable
risk
is
identical
on
both
cases.
employees
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
may
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
believe
that
is
true,
your
honor,
although
i
cannot
speak
with
authority
on
new
york
state
law.
the
authority
of
the
district
of
columbia
law
is
set
forth
in
our
--
in
our
brief
and
it's
the
same
for
all
life
insurance
companies
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
believe
that
basically,
there
would
not
be
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
investments
permitted
to
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
and
the
investment
permitted
by
a
lot
of
these
respondents.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
it
operates
generally
speaking
all
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
it
is
regulated
as
insurance
by
the
superintendent
of
insurance
of
the
state
of
new
york.
one
of
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
is,
therefore,
whether
or
not
the
general
public
may
buy
variable
annuities
if
they
so
desire.
it
is
not
seriously
questioned
that
only
a
life
insurance
company
may
issue
a
variable
annuity
policy.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
based
its
plea
for
regulation
of
respondents
on
two
premises.
first,
that
the
extent
of
the
investment
risk
borne
by
an
individual
policy
holder
determines
whether
or
not
an
annuity
is
also
a
security.
in
its
reply
brief,
the
commission
says,
at
the
foot
of
page
3,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
purchaser
of
traditional
insurance
assumes
no
investment
risk.
our
contention
is
that
congress
presumably
thought
that
that
risk
was
of
such
a
comparatively
minor
character
particularly
in
view
of
state
regulation
that
there
would
be
no
need
to
require
compliance
with
the
federal
securities
law.
as
to
the
investment
risk,
i
believe
it
is
clear
that
the
degree
of
investment
risk
assumed,
which
is
not
an
insurable
risk,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
annuity
should
be
regulated
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
congress
intended
that
all
annuity
should
be
regulated
solely
by
the
states.
second,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
says
that
the
public
is
not
adequately
protected
from
many
possible
abuses
in
the
sale
of
variable
annuities
despite
regulations
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
several
states.
this
statement
is
simply
incorrect.
life
insurance
regulation
commences
prior
to
the
formation
of
a
company
and
last
until
each
and
every
obligation
of
the
company
to
its
policy
holders
has
been
discharged.
it
has
been
said
that
the
business
of
life
insurance
is
more
regulated
than
any
other
business
activity
not
a
public
utility.
insurance
regulation
is
not
solely
of
the
disclosure
variety,
but
is
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
way
in
which
the
public
can
be
adequately
protected
by
--
through
regulations
so
stringent
that
will
ensure
the
fairness
of
every
policy
issued
and
every
practice
followed
by
the
company.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
superintendent
of
insurance
even
has
the
authority
to
refuse
to
renew
an
annual
license
to
an
insurance
company
if
he
believe
such
renewal
of
license
would
adversely
effect
the
public
interest.
petitioner
as
in
the
accident
and
health
cases
does
not
argue
that
these
statutes
are
mere
pretense.
petitioner's
argument
is
the
possibilities
of
abuse
are
inherit
in
sales
of
these
contracts,
while
the
same
could
be
said
of
any
policy
of
life
insurance.
the
real
question
is
with
regard
to
all
such
contracts,
what
agency
shall
protect
the
public
from
the
possibility
of
abuse.
in
the
field
of
life
insurance,
the
answer
is
now
as
it
has
been
for
generations.
the
state
legislatures
and
state
insurance
supervisors
shall
protect
the
public
in
the
public
interest.
securities
and
exchange
regulation,
the
respondents,
would
add
nothing
in
the
nature
of
public
protection.
unless
it
should
be
deemed
to
be
in
the
public
interest
to
destroy
respondents
and
to
allow
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
regulate
those
insurance
companies
which
it
alone
decides
do
not
assume
enough
of
the
investment
risk.
with
the
passage
of
the
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
at
section
18
of
the
investment
company
act,
it
applies
to
these
respondents
and
the
commission
does
not
differ
with
us
on
this,
would
make
it
legal,
the
present
charters
and
policies
issued
by
the
respondents.
section
18,
after
the
investment
company
act,
is
a
statute
designed
to
deal
with
the
situation
of
investment
company
and
to
prevent
senior
securities
debt
obligations
from
being
issued
by
a
mutual
fund
to
the
detriment
of
holders
of
mutual
funds.
a
life
insurance
policy
is
a
debt
obligation.
if
our
life
insurance
policies
are
debt
obligations,
and
section
18
applies
to
these
respondents,
then
every
policy
we've
issued
has
been
illegal
and
no
further
policies
we
could
issue
would
be
legal.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
i
think,
basically
--
if
your
honor
would
look
at
page
53
of
the
commission's
main
brief,
i
think
the
point
is
brought
out
there.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
this
is
a
historical
continuous
development
in
bits
and
pieces
in
the
life
insurance
business.
as
life
insurance
has
grown
and
as
its
obligations
to
policy
holders
grow,
it
has
become
apparent
that
investment
solely
in
the
field
of
mortgages
and
balance
will
not
suffice
because
the
dollar,
as
a
store
of
purchasing
power,
something
you
put
aside
today
for
use
25
years
from
now,
has
fallen
down
rather
badly.
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
--
there
has
been
no
attempt
either
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
provides
annuities
or
variable
annuities
for
its
state
employees
to
regulate
by
the
securities-exchange
commission.
in
the
college
retirement
equity
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin

mr.
benjamin

dorsey
yes,
sir.
state
legislature
created
in
1957,
the
state
of
wisconsin
retirement
fund.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
don't
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
with
the
passage
of
the
securities
act
in
1933,
congress
extended
federal
regulation
into
the
fields
of
interstate
security
transaction.
life
insurance
was
already
fully
regulated
at
this
time
and
congress
had
no
intention
of
commencing
to
regulate
life
insurance
policies.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
i've
answered
the
question
i
set
in
my
mind.
we
have
the
college
retirement
equities
fund
in
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
made
no
attempt
to
regulate.
we
have
a
commercial
company
called
the
“participating
annuity
life
insurance
company
in
arkansas”.
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
never
attempted
to
make
them
be
under
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
believe
in
the
case
of
participating
annuity
life
insurance
company,
since
1954,
in
the
case
of
the
college
retirement
equities
fund,
since
1952.
now,
in
the
field
of
group
insurance,
the
insurance
industry
has
provided
since
approximately
1950
a
group
annuity
called
the
“immediate
participation
guaranteed
annuity”
which
guaranteed
absolutely
no
investment
assumption
to
the
policy
holder
and
these
things
have
developed
in
an
orderly
fashion
in
the
life
insurance
industry.
and
this,
i
believe,
constitutes
the
first
and
only
attempt
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
take
the
position
that
where
the
investment
risk
lies
has
something
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
company
organize
under
state
law
and
regulated
under
state
law
and
selling
an
annuity
by
state
definition
suddenly
becomes
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
under
several
acts.

that
is
the
brief
of
the
other
respondent.
and
the
page,
i
do
not
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
no,
your
honor.
we
stipulated
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
any
difference
is
between
the
policies
were
immaterial.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
mutual
life
insurance
company?
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
the
mutual
life
insurance
company
sends
all
its
policies
or
debt
obligations
between
--
between
policy
holder
and
company
would
indeed
run
a
file
of
section
18
of
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
in
a
mutual
life
concerns
company
which
has
no
stock,
there
cannot
be
any
question
as
to
what
class
of
security
if
security
it'd
be
they're
issuing.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
generally,
that
is
so.
the
district
of
columbia
life
insurance
act
which
was
enacted
by
congress
many
years
ago
doesn't
have
such
limitation.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
it
wasn't
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
these
companies
to
spend
on
the
books,
statute
books
since
1934
and
applies
equally
to
every
life
insurance
company
organized
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
insofar
as
the
investment
aspect
of
a
life
insurance
company's
funds
go,
i
think
it
would
be
correct
to
say
that
it
is
not
typical
of
the
major
pattern
in
the
united
states.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
this
litigation
has
left
that
question
somewhat
unsettled
as
of
now,
but
i
think
there's
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
well,
at
the
moment,
i
believe
we
can
operate
in
several
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
lot
of
states
simply
will
take
no
action
until
this
case
is
decided.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
no,
your
honor.
you
must
obtain
a
license
to
do
business
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
--
in
any
state
where
you
wish
to
operate
on
a
general
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
(voice
overlap)
basis.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
it
pertains,
your
honor,
to
all
investible
assets
of
respondents.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
irrespective
of
anything.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
if
your
honor
please,
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
whether
or
not
these
companies
are
selling
an
annuity
or
whether
they
are
selling
a
security
and
that
where
you
invest
your
money
is
something
the
states
set
the
boundaries
on
and
that's
it.
when
congress
enacted
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
congress
enacted
the
securities
act,
the
legislative
history
particular
house
report
85
which
accompanied
the
bill
became
law.
i
believe
it
makes
it
clear
that
no
insurance
policy
was
intended
to
be
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
your
honor,
in
order
to
make
this
point
crystal
clear,
the
congress
put
section
3
(a)
(8)
in
the
securities
act.
and
section
3
(a)
(8)
says
that
any
insurance
policy
or
any
annuity
policy
is
exempt
from
section
2
of
the
act.
now,
in
the
securities
act,
congress
did
not
undertake
to
define
insurance
or
annuity,
and
i
think
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
that,
because
insurance
companies
are
formed
under
state
law
and
not
federal
law,
and
insurance
policies
are
issued
by
insurance
companies
after
being
approved
by
state
regulatory
authority.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
think
--
i
think
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
with
regard
to
section
3
(a)
(8)
of
the
securities
act,
i
think
the
commission,
in
page
56
of
its
brief,
has
expressed
the
proper
view
of
that
section
and
that
is
to
say
that
when
a
single
state
insurance
supervisor
determines
this
question,
the
effect
of
the
subsection
is
to
create
a
nationwide
exemption
from
section
2
of
the
act.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
the
commission
says,
in
its
brief
at
page
56
--
now,
they
filed
two
briefs,
a
reply
brief
and
a
main
brief.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
will
read
you
from
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
56,
if
i
may,
“the
securities
act
exemption
section
3
(a)
(8)
15
u.s.c.
77aa
provides
a
total
countrywide
exemption
where
the
insurance
is
issued
by
a
company
licensed
by
any
state
authority.”
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
precondition
is
that
the
state
shall
decide
for
itself
what
is
insurance
and
what
is
an
annuity.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
it
is
controlling
on
the
construction
of
the
new
york
life
insurance
act.
it
is
also
controlling
and
that
is
what
the
commission
is
saying
here
on
the
determination
under
3
(a)
8
of
the
securities
act.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
quite
so,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
that
is
my
proposition,
and
i
believe
that
the
commission
agrees
with
it.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
well,
your
honor,
in
an
extreme
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
except
in
an
extreme
case,
your
honor,
as
in
the
cambridge
loan
case
which
was
presented
to
this
court.
i
believe
what
congress
intended
was
that
one,
the
state
shall
define
what
it
is
an
annuity.
and
two,
as
the
commission
says,
and
i
think
they're
right,
that
when
a
single
state
insurance
supervisor
has
made
such
a
determination,
effective
his
determination
is
to
create
a
nationwide
exemption
from
the
securities
act.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
could
we?
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
no,
your
honor.
we
have
not
--
we
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
district
of
columbia,
west
virginia.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
i
believe
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
leave
the
determination
with
the
state
legislatures
and
the
state
insurance
supervisors.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
congress
could.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
professor
loss
in
his
book
securities
regulation
says
the
commission
has
taken,
this
is
page
19
of
the
brief,
the
commission
has
taken
--
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
the
blue
one,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
19,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
the
commission
--
this
is
quoting
from
professor
loss,
“the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
insurance
or
endowment
policies
or
annuity
contracts
issued
by
regularly
constituted
life
insurance
companies
were
not
intended
to
be
securities.”
and
as
mccormick
says
in
his
book,
“only
those
insurance
or
annuity
policies
are
exempted,
which
are
issued
by
corporations
under
the
jurisdiction
of
a
designated
insurance
supervisor.”
mr.
benjamin
h.
dorsey
that
is
why
i
read
what
they
have
said
in
their
brief,
your
honor.
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
more
than
used
the
time
allotted
to
me,
and
i
wish
to
thank
the
court.
