mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
now,
the
right
hand
column
of
that
chart
is
not
in
the
record
and
we
never
saw
it
until
the
beginning
of
this
argument.
could
you
tell
us
when
that
was
filed
with
the
sec
by
the
united
fund.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
it
is
not
in
this
record.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
we
were
asking
when
it.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like,
in
the
short
time
i
have,
to
devote
myself
to
about
two
or
three
questions,
particularly
the
two
that
were
asked
by
mr.
justice
black
on
last
thursday.
before
starting
that,
however,
i
should
like
to
report
one
or
two
question
that
were
asked
during
the
first
argument
of
mr.
--
the
--
the
preceding
speaker.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
if
cref
could
be
claimed
to
be
exempted
under
any
other
section
besides
3
(a)
(8).
we
are
very
good
friends
of
cref
and
we
would
not
wish
to
leave
them
without
their
full
defense.
of
course,
they
were
claimed
to
be
exempt
under
3
(a)
(8),
but
they
also,
i
think,
would
claim
to
be
exempt
from
the
1930
act
under
section
3
(a)
(4)
which
exempts
any
security
issued
by
a
person,
and
that's
broadly
defined,
organize
and
operated
exclusively
for
religious,
educational,
etcetera,
purpose.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
cref
is
organized
as
a
nonprofit
organization,
but
it
was
put
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
insurance
department.
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
section
18
(f),
i
may
say
that
we
have
used
that
in
all
three
courts
as
the
most
striking
example,
and
it
has
never
been
answered.
but
we
anticipated
that
someone
would
answer
it
by
saying,
“what
about
a
mutual
company?”
and
that
gave
us
some
concern
until
the
sec
provided
us
with
the
answer
to
that
on
page
10
of
their
current
reply
briefs
filed
on
the
15th
of
this
month.
they
pointed
out
on
page
10
of
the
small
reply
brief
that
the
district
of
columbia
life
insurance
act,
it
is
provided
in
their
full
paragraph
under
second
sentence,
the
district
of
--
first
--
first
sentence,
“the
district
of
columbia
life
insurance
act
illustrates
that
local
regulation
of
insurance
is
patently
not
adopted
to
regulation
of
the
investment
aspects
of
the
variable
annuity.”
then
the
next
sentence,
“the
sale
of
investment
contracts
or
other
securities
is
prohibited
thereunder
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
an
insurance
policy.”
there
is
no
question
as
mr.
meeker
has
admitted
and
mr.
dorsey
of
nasd
has
admitted
that
we
are
selling
life
insurance
and
disability
insurance
with
it
and
even
if
we
were
a
mutual
company,
as
i
read
the
sec
brief,
that
statute
would
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
issue
variable
annuities
if
they
were
securities.
the
two
questions
that
i
was
particularly
interested
in
discussing
against
the
excellent
background
mr.
--
of
mr.
ben
dorsey.
first,
who
regulates
us
now
and
secondly,
what
does
the
purchaser
get.
we
are
now
regulated
and
when
i
speak
of
“we”,
i
mean,
valic.
there
are
two
--
two
respondents
here.
one
is
eali,
equity
annuity
life
insurance
company
for
whom
mr.
dorsey
spoke.
the
other
is
valic
for
whom
mr.
earnest
and
i
will
speak.
we
are
presently
under
the
regulation
of
the
insurance
superintendent
or
the
commissioner
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
west
virginia,
of
kentucky,
of
arkansas,
of
alabama
and
of
new
mexico.
the
extent
of
the
regulation
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
59
to
64
where
we
have
extensively
summarized
it.
the
west
virginia
regulation
is
set
forth
in
the
second
volume
of
the
--
of
the
record
at
page
824,
and
i
should
like
to
mention
just
one
or
two
of
the
things
in
that
regulation
which
strike
me
as
rather
unusual.
at
page
825
in
section
25,
among
the
other
things
which
can
--
which
is
regulated
by
the
insurance
superintendent
of
west
virginia
is
a
limitation
on
profits
that
can
be
paid
to
stockholders.
now,
this
is
no
fly-by-night
company
which
out
to
sell
the
kind
of
policy
mr.
dorsey
described,
there,
as
well
as
in
arkansas,
which
is
the
next
exhibit,
there
is
a
provision.
the
arkansas
provision
applying
--
appearing
on
page
830
in
section
9
that
the
insurance
commissioner,
in
reviewing
our
annual
statements,
can
determine
whether
our
operations
are
resulting
in
excessive
profits
to
our
stockholders.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
no,
sir.
we
would
not
go
so
far
as
mr.
dorsey
on
his
--
on
behalf
of
his
client.
it
is
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
each
state
must
decide
what
constitutes
insurance
in
that
state.
now,
this
is
a
finding
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
81,
the
finding
of
the
insurance
commissioner
which
were
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
the
--
and
in
that
connection
elsewhere
in
our
brief,
the
west
virginia
superintendent
has
stated
that
he
has
twice
examined
ours
and
found
they
adequately
protect
our
policyholders.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
that
connection,
without
trying
to
pick
the
page
at
the
moment,
one
of
the
sec
experts
who
was
the
only
one
who
knew
anything
about
insurance,
testified
voluntarily,
nobody
asked
a
question.
he
testified
though,
and
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
that,
of
course,
a
mere
disclosure
or
a
mere
report
will
not
provide
protection
for
solvency
as
well
an
examination.
now,
we
have
been
examined,
as
the
record
shows,
annually
by
the
district
of
columbia
superintendent
of
insurance,
twice
by
the
west
virginia
superintendent
of
insurance
and
are
subject
to
examination
by
any
of
the
other
superintendents
and
--
at
three
intervals
by
what
is
called
a
convention
examination
of
a
group
of
insurance
commission.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
i
may
have
misunderstood,
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
i
thought
i
filed
it.
did
i
miss
it?
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
it
--
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
--
so,
sir,
and
that
is
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
we
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that
is
correct.
and
take
new
york
--
well,
let
us
take
connecticut
for
instance,
because
the
sec
makes
a
great
play
of
the
spellacy
case
in
connecticut.
the
spellacy
case
held
that
under
the
connecticut
law,
a
fraternal
benefit
society
would
not
be
allowed
to
issue
what
was
called
a
variable
endowment
policy.
they
held
that
under
the
connecticut
law,
that
was
not
insurance.
as
a
dictum,
they
paid
a
passing
comment
to
the
variable
annuity
so-called
“option”
in
that
policy.
seven
questions
had
been
reserved
for
the
superior
--
supreme
court.
one
of
which
was,
is
this
a
security?
they
did
not
answer
that.
now,
the
another
fact
was
that
in
connecticut,
they
said
this
is
not
an
insurance
under
our
statute.
and
of
course,
we
would
think
that
under
the
present
statute
in
connecticut,
we
could
not
be
admitted
there.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
what
the
man
gets,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
this
is
insurance.
the
business
of
life
insurance,
and
this
is
all
from
the
record,
incidentally,
mr.
mcclain
from
--
the
author
quoted,
testified
at
the
trial.
mr.
meyer,
the
author
quoted,
testified
at
the
trial.
both
of
them
agreed
that
this
was
the
life
insurance
business.
and
on
your
question,
mr.
justice
warren,
with
respect
to
cref,
in
cref,
as
mr.
dorsey
pointed
out,
the
group,
that
is
the
policyholders,
carry
the
risk
of
expense,
of
death
and
of
investments.
in
our
case,
as
he
also
pointed
out,
the
policyholder
has
the
incidental
--
the
risk
of
the
investment
results,
but
not
of
the
mortality
or
the
expense.so
that
was
a
greater
sharing
of
the
--
of
what
you
might
call
the
variables
in
cref
than
in
our
case.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
well,
he
does
it
in
both
of
those.
both
in
cref
and
in
ours,
he
assumes
the
investment
risk.
he
does
--
in
ours,
he
does
not
assume
the
debts
risk.
in
other
words,
that
the
whole
group
lives
excessively
long,
excessively
being
used
in
the
sense
of
beyond
the
mortality
table.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
our
company
bears
that
risk.
in
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
--
cref,
it
would
cut
down
everybody's
--
it
seems
to
us,
if
the
court
please,
that
one
of
the
crucial
findings
in
the
case
on
one
of
the
questions
asked
is
finding
number
28.
finding
number
28
points
out
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
it's
on
page
100,
most
conventional
annuity
policies,
contracts
provide
for
periodic
payments
in
fixed
dollar
amounts.
now,
this
is
the
one
that
we
are
all
accustomed
to
deal
with.
such
policy
contracts
may
guarantee
that
the
periodic
amounts
determinable
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
contained
therein
will
be
paid
regardless
of
the
investment
mortality
or
expense
rates
--
expense
experience
of
the
company.
under
participating
annuity
policy
contracts,
the
amount
of
the
payments
to
the
annuitant
may
vary
due
to
the
declaration
by
the
insurance
company
of
dividends
to
the
annuitant
arising
from
experience
more
favorable
than
anticipated.
the
plaintiff,
sec,
does
not
contend
neither
has
it
shown
that
it
has
ever
instituted
any
action
to
hold
a
participating
policy
to
be
a
security.
we
have
used
the
participating
policy
as
the
most
supple
approach
to
discuss
what
this
man
gets.
this
variable
annuity,
if
you
cut
through
everything
else,
is
nothing
but
a
life
annuity
contract
issued
by
an
insurance
company
that
--
that
provides
completely
for
participation.
now,
the
difference
is,
and
the
--
and
the
--
really
the
sole
difference
is
that
the
participating
annuity
contains
a
nominal
minimum
payment.
that
nominal
minimum
payment
is
based
upon
an
assumed
interest
rate
of
2%
to
2.5%.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
history
of
that
development
largely
from
sec
sources.
prior
to
1935,
the
insurance
companies
were
assuming
a
larger
amount.
about
1930,
and
along
in
that
period,
the
insurance
companies
discovered
two
things.
they
discovered
people
were
living
longer,
which
was
a
delightful
discovery
from
the
standpoint
of
life
insurance,
but
which
involves
certain
risks
from
the
standpoint
of
annuities
which
had
been
based
upon
actuarial
studies
as
to
when
the
group
would
die.
and
they
found
also
that
the
investment
assumptions
they
were
making
were
excessive.
this
is
all
set
forth
in
tnec
monograph
28.
the
net
result
of
those
two
factors
was
to
put
pressure
on
the
life
insurance
annuity
business.
not
only
were
people
living
longer,
but
the
assumptions
which
they
had
made
as
to
earnings
were
proving
too
much.
they
solved,
we
hope,
because
if
they
haven't,
50
years
from
now,
we
shall
have
certain
troubles,
they
solved
the
mortality
problem
by
a
series
of
new
mortality
tables.
the
sec
expert
testified
that
in
the
past
70
years,
there
had
been
a
whole
series
of
new
mortality
tables.
each
one
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
we
do
live
longer.
they
solved
the
investment
problem
by
--
and
this
is
sec
itself
saying
it
in
tnec
monograph,
by
reducing
the
assumed
interest
rate
to
2%
or
2.5%.
now,
in
the
past
50
years,
there
have
been
only
three
years
in
which
the
insurance
companies
overall
have
made
less
than
3%.
the
average
interest
rate
--
and
as
the
nasd
has
explained
to
us,
interest
rate
in
the
insurance
world
means
the
investment
earnings,
whether
from
rents,
dividends
or
anything
else.
the
average
interest
rate
has
been
about
4%
and
they
took
care
of
the
--
of
the
whole
situation
by
putting
in
this
nominal
minimum,
which
was
so
low
that
only
a
catastrophe
could
ever
reduce
the
company
to
it,
and
providing
for
participation
in
the
excess
earnings
to
that
dividends
to
participating
policyholders.
now,
that
is
precisely
what
this
man
buys.
when
he
is
35,
and
we
have
used
him
for
an
example,
and
we
have
given
these
figures
on
page
19
of
our
brief.
we
take
a
35-year-old
man
as
the
most
logical
candidate
for
a
deferred
annuity.
and
we
start
from
the
rate
book,
which
is
in
evidence,
and
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
2.
and
the
page
in
question,
if
we
could
just
take
one
second
to
look
at
this,
we
--
we
will
have
the
answer
to
what
the
man
gets.
the
page
in
question
is
record
619.
he
is
35
years
old.
he's
a
very
prosperous
man,
i
presume,
because
he
decides
he
will
pay
$1000
annual
premium,
and
he
will
take
a
policy
that
will
provide
him
for
his
retirement
--
provide
for
his
retirement
when
he
is
65.
he
pays
$30,000.
on
page
618,
the
top
line
is
annuity
premium
without
waiver.
i'm
using
10
times
those
figures.
now,
if
he
had
wanted
to
have
a
waiver
of
premium
in
the
event
of
his
total
disability,
instead
of
$1000,
he
would
have
paid
$1035.
that's
about
five
lines
down.
for
the
extra
$35,
he
would
have
no
one
that
should
he
become
disabled
anytime
in
the
next
30
years,
the
company
would
waive
his
premiums,
that
is
it
would
be
made
up
from
the
other
reserves.
the
sec
concede
that
is
strictly
an
insurance
function.
now,
in
addition,
if
he
were
insurable
physically,
he
would
have
been
required
to
have
a
minimum
of
life
insurance
in
this
contract.
why
that
minimum?
for
obvious
reasons,
i
think
it
provides
a
protection
during
the
early
years
of
the
policy
when,
as
in
all
life
insurance
business,
the
expenses
tend
to
center.
all
life
insurance
is
based
on
what
is
called
the
acquisition
cost
which
is
higher
in
the
first
years.
and
so,
he
--
if
he
is
insurable,
we
say
you
must
have
enough
life
insurance
for
the
first
five
years
to
know
that
you
have
in
case
of
catastrophe
and
death,
you
are
protected
there.
he
may
take
more.
we
have
a
family
protection
policy
without
top
limit,
which
has
been
approved
by
the
insurance
commissioner
and
which
will
carry
him
insured
without
reduction
until
he
is
65.
but
let's
set
that
aside.
now,
the
total
premium
for
his
five
years
of
reducing
time
life
insurance
is
only
$105.
that
has
been
according
to
the
actuaries
of
the
sec.
that
is
a
perfectly
normal
premium.
in
the
--
on
page
618
in
the
lower
right-hand
corner,
there
is
a
table
which
shows
the
percentage
of
basic
annuity
premium
which
is
applied
to
provide
the
deferred
annuity
benefits.
and
with
life
insurance,
the
first
year
is
46.07%
and
without
life
insurance,
it's
48%.
the
next
year,
it
jumps
to
88%
and
so
on.
now,
the
difference
between
the
46.07%
and
the
48%
is
the
life
insurance
premium.
that's
where
we
get
our
life
insurance
premium,
by
that
small
percentage
difference.
now,
when
you
calculate
out
the
percentages,
which
you
applied,
and
when
this
man
approaches
65,
he
has
paid
$30,000
of
that
amount,
$26,745
has
been
allocated
to
the
reserve
for
his
policy.
he
has,
at
that
point,
if
there
was
zero
adjustment
on
his
policy,
$26,745.
$105
were
used
for
his
life
insurance.
$600
is
the
average
amount
of
state
taxation
on
this
form
of
thrift.
the
sec
expert
told
us
that
the
average
premium
tax
is
2%.
and
that
leaves
$2550
of
his
$30,000
of
premiums,
which
has
gone
to
this
company
against
its
expenses,
its
contingencies
and
perhaps,
its
profits,
if
it
makes
any.
now,
during
the
period
when
he
has
been
accumulating
this
$26,745,
the
only
difference
between
this
policy
and
any
annuity
which
anyone
else
has,
is
that
the
company
adjust
the
--
the
old
annuity
adjust
by
an
assumed
rate
which
was
2%,
and
perhaps,
adds
to
what
it
calls
your
cash
value
the
--
from
excess
interest.
when
he
reaches
65,
he,
like
anyone
else,
has
a
cash
value.
and
we
have
shown
from
the
record
in
our
brief,
a
comparison
of
the
accumulated
cash
values
of
a
valic
policy
on
the
assumption
we
make
3.5%
interest,
a
lincoln
national
life
insurance
company
--
where
is
that
thing
--
and
a
canada
life
insurance
company.
the
latter
two
companies
are
all
lined
companies
and
the
only
thing
we
have
done
is
take
the
cash
value
which
is
provided
in
that
policy
of
this
and
add
to
it
the
amount
that
that
cash
value
would
be
increased
by
their
continuing
participation
at
--
at
the
present
rates.
that
table
is
summarized
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
this
man
becomes
64.
he
then
loans.
he
has
cancer,
and
he
is
going
to
die
in
five
years.
west
virginia
says,
“we
cannot
issue
one
of
these
policies,”
it's
in
the
regulations
i
pointed
out,
“unless
we
provide
that
he
has
the
option
to
take
his
cash
value
before
entering
on
his
annuity”.
the
district
of
columbia
has
the
same
provision
in
essence.
at
that
point,
before
he
becomes
an
annuitant
in
this
policy
as
in
any
other
policy,
if
there
is
some
contingency
in
his
life,
he
may
take
his
cash
value.
but
if
he
does
not,
if
he
stands
tough,
we
have
no
option,
that
they
--
that
we
issue
this
policy.
we
have
agreed
that
when
this
man
becomes
65,
unless
he
exercises
an
option,
we
will
begin
to
pay
him
an
annuity
which
will
run
for
his
life.
now,
in
this
assumption,
we
have
a
man
with
$46,900
of
cash
value.
at
65,
he
must
decide,
he
may
take
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes.
this
--
this
is
a
man
who
is
--
he
took
it
at
35
and
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
and
--
and
paid
for
30
years.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
at
that
time,
he
must
decide.
he
has
three
options
on
the
plaintiff's
exhibit
1
on
page
--
on
the
third
page
under
--
no,
it
starts
on
the
first
page
of
general
provisions.
the
benefits
payable
to
the
annuitant,
he
--
that
is
here,
mr.
justice
warren.
it
looks
like
this.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
he
made
--
he
--
no.
he
may
--
he
may
demand
and
receive
before
he
starts
on
his
annuity
whatever
his
cash
value
is.
the
company
does
not
purport,
and
of
course,
we
have
--
we
face
all
these
facts.
we
don't
argue
any
of
the
fact.
the
company
would
not
know
now,
to
date,
what
his
cash
value
will
be
at
65.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that
was
a
--
an
exhibit
that
is
taken
from
one
of
the
exhibits
in
evidence
in
which
we
did
this.
it's
--
it's
rather
a
long
exhibit
on
page
853
of
the
record.
what
we
wanted
to
do
for
the
trial
court
was
to
show
that
what
we
are
doing
in
essence,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
you
would
deference
a
degree,
but
in
essence,
it's
what
any
life
insurance
company
does.
so
we
took
the
lincoln
national
and
the
canada
life
insurance
company
and
we
took
policies
on
the
same
age,
same
sex
and
same
premium.
we
took
from
their
table
what
their
cash
value
would
be.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
but
we
knew
that
was
not
the
true
cash
value.
it
never
is
in
any
participating
policy.
so
we
then
determined
what
their
current
dividends
were,
which
they
pay
to
their
policy
holders
from
their
investment
and
other
gains.
and
we
assume
that
this
man
exercised
his
right,
which
he
has
with
lincoln
national,
to
leave
those
in
to
increase
his
annuity.
now,
when
he
did
that,
he
increased
his
guaranteed
cash
value
from
$37,000
to
$43,000
and
that
was
in
lincoln
national.
similarly
with
canada
life,
he
increased
it
to
$43,000.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
variable
annuity
life
insurance
company,
we
understated
ourselves,
our
hope,
but
we
assumed
that
we
would
make
3.5%
per
year
in
the
net
investment
factor
to
adjust
his
reserves
by
and
we
adjusted
by
that
each
year.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
there
is
a
greater
degree
of
conjecture
in
our
cases.
in
the
canada
life
or
lincoln,
the
only
degree
of
conjecture
would
be
the
--
the
amount
of
the
excess
dividends
he
would
have.
in
our
case,
it
depends
upon
our
performance
from
the
beginning.
that
is
correct.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
well,
we
were
assuming
3.5%.
we
--
we
stated
our
assumption,
then
we
draw
the
parallel
because
we
wanted
to
be
able
to
get
to
the
point
of
explaining
what
the
man
has
when
he
retires.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that's
the
only
contingency,
yes,
sir.
now,
when
he
retires
if
he
says
a
widower
then
his
children
are
educated
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
he
would
bear
that
risk,
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that
is
also
--
for
illustrative
purposes
in
the
record,
the
witness
on
that
was
the
head
of
research
on
investments
at
prudential
land.
they
have
made
a
few
--
prudential
insurance
company,
and
they
took
the
worst
possible
situation
of
a
man
who
paid
premiums
15
years.
they
thought
it
was
retiring
at
the
bottom
of
the
depression
and
they
have
the
chart
in
here
showing
how
he
came
up.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
and
of
course,
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
the
very
bad
experience
with
a
number
of
companies
during
the
depression.
if
a
company
goes
broke,
it
goes
broke.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
sir?
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
well,
not
if
the
company
cannot.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
for
instance,
in
--
in
the
southwest,
we
were
very
familiar
during
the
depression
with
the
missouri
state
life
insurance
company
where
each
policyholder
received
a
lien
against
this
policy
because
the
company
had
--
had
gone
broke.
some
of
those
liens
were
as
high
as
100%
of
your
accumulated
value
and
not
on
the
missouri
state
but
others.
to
--
to
rush
so
that
i
won't
absorb
mr.
earnest's
time,
i
wanted
to
show
what
this
man
gets.
let
us
assume
that
he
does
--
that
the
company
does
under
the
supervision
of
the
insurance
commissioner
and
investing
solely
in
legal
investments
have
a
reserve
for
his
policy
of
$40,000.
he
is
now
65.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
he
is
--
he's
had
a
medical
examination.
he's
a
smart
operator.
he's
at
the
medical
examination
and
the
doctor
said,
“boy,
you're
as
good
as
--
as
a
kid.
you
will
live
forever.”
so
naturally,
he
wants
his
annuity.
he's
got
a
right
to
it.
he's
--
he's
contracted
for
that
when
he
was
35.
and
he
said,
“i
will
take
a
straight
life
annuity.”
then
the
company
says,
“all
right,
you
have
$40,000.
your
first
payment
will
be
40
times
$6.81,
which
will
be
roughly
--
roughly
$270
for
the
first
month.”
now,
mr.
dorsey
has
said,
and
how
he
could
say
it,
i
don't
know,
that
we
guarantee
nothing
after
that.
this
man
has
paid
$30,000
and
all
we've
guaranteed
to
do
is
to
pay
him
$270.
if
that
were
true,
i'm
sure
that
we
would
be
looking
for
a
new
insurance
superintendent
of
the
district
of
columbia.
so
long
as
this
gentleman
lives,
he
will
get
$6.81
every
month
so
long
as
our
net
investment
rate
is
3.5%.
now,
if
we
make
4%,
he
would
get
slightly
more
than
$6.81.
and
if
we
make
3%,
he
will
get
slightly
less.
in
cref,
the
man
who
retired
in
1952
with
a
$10
payment
are
getting
$18.
but
that's
been
a
good
year,
a
good
period.
now,
if
he
were
not
a
widower,
but
he
had
a
wife
and
he
wanted
to
be
sure
to
protect
her
and
say
she
were
at
that
time
60,
he
would
then
go
over
to
the
next
page
and
see
the
option
of
a
joint
and
survivor
annuity.
and
if
he
were
alone
and
did
not
have
a
joint
and
survivor
but
wanted
to
be
assured
that
10
years
certain
would
be
paid
to
him,
he
would
use
option
b.
the
net
effect
is
that
he
would
have
an
annuity
which
would
be
precisely
like
any
other
annuity,
except
that
he
has
consciously
and
deliberately
said,
“i
want
an
annuity
that
will
tend
to
keep
pace
with
the
cost
of
living
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
reserves
are
invested
in
equities.”
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
it
would
go
to
a
designated
beneficiary
or
his
estate.
yes,
sir.
just
like
any
other.
and
in
closing,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
three
things
which
have
been
in
the
newspapers
in
recent
days.
first,
of
course,
was
the
president's
address
dealing
with
inflation,
but
secondly
and
more
significant,
it
seems
to
--
and
i
--
i
can't
say
more
significant,
but
--
but
more
current,
was
something
that
was
in
the
paper
today.
on
one
page
of
the
post,
there
is
an
article,
adjusted
income
figure
showed
the
inflation
drained
which
points
out
that
millions
of
people
who
had
$170
billion
of
financial
savings
at
the
end
of
1950
now
find
that
$30
billion
had
been
wiped
out.
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
page,
a
reference
to
an
article
by
mr.
roswell
mcgill
that
if
we
keep
on
in
25
or
30
years
our
present
48%
dollar
may
well
be
worth
only
a
dime.
the
trial
court
has
found
that
the
variable
--
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
sir?
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
advertised
by
the
reader's
digest,
yes,
sir.
the
trial
court
has
found
that
this
policy
is
based
upon
studies
designed.
it
--
nobody
can
guarantee,
no
one
would
guarantee
that
it
will
precisely
match
the
cost
of
living.
but
all
history
has
shown
that
it
will
tend
to
do
so
and
the
economist
testifying
at
the
trial
said
this.
he
said,
“value
to
me
is
purchasing
power.”
and
i
am
not
sure
that
a
man
who
30
years
ago
contracted
to
have
$200
a
day
and
receives
$200
a
day
is
getting
value.
we
believe
that
if
he
is
--
if
the
--
if
the
insurance
industry
is
allowed
to
develop
this
contract
without
harassment
within
the
legal
investments
provided
for
insurance
companies,
we
can
offer
a
solution
for
his
difficulties.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
no,
sir.
they
had
that
opportunity
about
a
year
ago.
the
--
but
they
didn't
take
it.
the
life
insurance
act
was
being
severely
amended
to
increase
the
insurance
superintendent's
powers.
this
was
after
the
trial
in
this
case
when
the
trial
court
had
said
these
arguments
should
to
congress,
but
no
effort
was
made.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that
is
right.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that
is
right.
mr.
roy
w.
mcdonald
that
is
right.
yes,
sir.
in
the
case
of
the
lincoln
national,
the
contractual
right
is
$37,000.
in
the
case
of
the
valic,
the
contractual
right
is
the
reserved
that's
been
set
up.
