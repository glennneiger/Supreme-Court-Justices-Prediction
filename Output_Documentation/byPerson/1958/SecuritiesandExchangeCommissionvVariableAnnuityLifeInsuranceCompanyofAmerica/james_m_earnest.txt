mr.
james
m.

may
it
--
mr.
james
m.
earnest
--
please
the
court.
after
the
rather
full
arguments
of
mr.
ben
dorsey
and
my
associate,
mr.
mcdonald,
i
feel
that
further
label
on
this
case
perhaps
is
not
necessary,
but
i
do
have
two
or
three
observations
which
i
think
might
be
of
some
aid
to
the
court.
the
distinguished
general
counsel
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
devoted
some
considerable
time
here
on
thursday,
enjoying
a
comparison
between
plaintiff's
exhibit
21
and
some
unidentified
information
of
united
funds.
with
respect
to
plaintiff's
exhibit
21
and
i'm
sure
that
this
is
an
inadvertence
on
his
part,
may
i
invite
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
was
a
preliminary
so-called
“sales
kit”
used
by
valic
in
its
early
formative
stages
that
its
use
was
discontinued
wholly
before
the
institution
of
this
lawsuit
and
it
has
never
been
used
since.
and
i
saw
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
what
i
said.
may
i
read
from
the
deposition
taken
on
february
19th
by
the
then
trial
attorney
of
the
sec,
whom
i
confess
was
not
the
distinguished
general
counsel,
from
page
338,
the
witness
marsh
(ph)
was
on
the
stand
and
he
was
asked
this
question,
“was
there
a
sales
kit
used
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
policies?”
marked
plaintiff's
exhibit
6a
through
6h
answer,
“there
was
a
sales
kit
prepared
for
use,
and
we
had
--
we
had
conducted
an
experiment
with
one
man
and
had
him
call
on
approximately
50
people.
and
as
a
result
of
his
activity,
we
abandoned
the
kit
as
worthless.”
and
then
when
we
came
to
the
--
mr.
james
m.
earnest
of
the
deposition
of
the
witness
--
mr.
james
m.
earnest
marsh
(ph)
which
was
not
printed,
your
honor.
it
is
before,
your
honor,
the
entire
record
being
up
here.
then
during
the
trial,
when
this
whole
obsolete
sales
kit
was
offered
in
evidence,
i
objected.
and
at
page
620
of
the
original
transcript
of
the
proceedings
in
the
lower
court,
likewise
before
this
court,
but
not
printed,
and
i
neglected
to
make
one
statement
and
the
deposition
of
the
witness
marsh
(ph)
clearly
shows
it
that
the
old
sales
kit
was
identified
in
the
depositions
as
exhibit
number
9,
whereas
when
it
was
offered
in
evidence,
it
became
21.
and
so
i
ask
this
question
or
request
this
stipulation
after
i
objected
to
the
introduction
of
plaintiff's
21,
i'm
reading
from
page
620,
“i
would
request
mr.
feldman,
he
was
the
chief
trial
attorney
for
sec,
to
stipulate
what
appears
in
the
depositions
in
respect
to
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
21,
which
was
identified
in
the
deposition
as
exhibit
9,
namely
that
this
was
the
first
so-called
sales
kit
of
valic,
that
it
was
shown
to
a
limited
number
of
people,
as
i
recall
not,
exceeding
50,
that
it
very
soon
became
apparent
to
valic
that
it
was
impertinent
and
could
be
considerably
improved
upon,
and
that
it
was
discontinued
only
after
having
been
subjected
to
a
very
limited
use,
that
it
is
not
now
used
and
has
not
been
used."
mr.
feldman
responded,
“i
will
stipulate
that
it
was
shown
to
a
number
of
people
not
exceeding
50.
i
will
further
stipulate
that
it
is
not
now
being
used.”
and
so
while
the
purpose
of
drawing
this
comparison,
it
was
rather
obscure
to
me,
at
least
it
is
wholly
based
upon
something
which
we
did
not
use,
haven't
--
we're
not
using
at
the
time
of
the
institution
of
this
lawsuit.
mr.
james
m.
earnest
sir?
mr.
james
m.
earnest
i
don't
say
that
it
was
inaccurate,
your
honor.
in
the
formative
stages
of
this
company
in
trying
to
describe
our
business,
we
had
a
sales
kit
which
incidentally
doesn't
go
to
the
perspective
purchase.
so
this
is
purely
an
interoffice
communication
that
we
give
to
our
agents.
but
when
he
took
it
and
attempted
to
make
a
presentation
on
certain
prospects,
he
got
no
response
and
we
concluded
there
was
something
with
the
descriptive
and
therefore
we
abandoned
it.
it
had
no
appeal.
mr.
james
m.
earnest
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
earnest
i
don't
think
so
for
the
moment.
we
just
--
our
experience
was
that
it
was
ineffectual
--
mr.
james
m.
earnest
--
to
accomplish
a
sale,
but
it
is
not
inactive.
now,
secondly,
if
your
honor
pleases,
if
i
understand
distinguished
general
counsel,
he
is
still
somewhat
silently,
at
least,
complains
about
the
refusal
of
the
lower
court
to
permit
an
amendment.
he
had
to
charge
misrepresentations
and
then
proceeds
to
imply,
at
least,
in
his
argument,
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
that
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
way
that
we
presented
this
product
to
our
perspective
purchasers.
and
may
i
say
this.
this
lawsuit,
your
honors,
didn't
spring
up
overnight.
they
called
us
down
there
or
the
predecessor
company
in
september
of
1955
and
we
were
before
them
constantly
for
nine
long
months
in
which
we
voluntarily
presented
to
them
every
policy,
every
piece
of
sales,
literature,
our
books
and
records
and
everything
that
we
had,
and
in
october
of
1955,
prepared
and
filed
a
110-page
brief
with
them
so
that
--
and
we
also,
in
a
spirit
of
cooperation,
agreed
to
voluntarily
refrain
from
writing
any
policies
until
they
should
have
made
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
attempt
to
superimpose
federal
on
state
regulation.
and
i
waited
patiently,
september,
october,
november
and
december.
come
december
30
and
having
met
with
these
gentleman
three,
four,
five
as
many
as
14
at
the
time,
we
felt
that
the
time
had
come
when
we
should
start
writing
the
verbal
policy
and
so
we'd
notify
them
we
are
going
to
start
that
effective
december
30.
mr.
james
m.
earnest
thank
you,
your
honors,
very
much.
