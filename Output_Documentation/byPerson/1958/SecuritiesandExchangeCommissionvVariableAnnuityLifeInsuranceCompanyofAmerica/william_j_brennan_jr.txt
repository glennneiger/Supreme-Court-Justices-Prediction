of

don't
know
if
i
understood,
mr.
dorsey,
you
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
why
the
interest
in
your
association.
is
this
a
competitive
security
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
otherwise,
you
are
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
in
selling
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,

justice
william
j.
brennan,

me,
mr.

before
you
get
to
that,
you
just
say
that
the
cash
surrender
value
of
$46,902
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
the
amount
which

annuity
characterize,
he
may
demand
and
receive

justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
without
regard
to
any
investment
risk
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,

what
is
this
$46,900?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
insured
cash
value.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i
don't
quite
get
to
understand
is
did
the
right
degree
of
conjecture
about
whether
he'd
get
$46,902

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
your
case
not
present
in
the
case
of
the
lincoln

canada
life.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
then,
i
don't
quite
understand
why
--
how
can
they
draw
the
power.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
meeker,
are
you
going
to
include
a
reference
to
the
argument
that
they
come
within
the
investment
act
that
puts
them
out
of
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question.
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
