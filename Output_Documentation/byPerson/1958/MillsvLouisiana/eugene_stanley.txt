mr.
chief

may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
case
number
74,
henry
j.
mills
and
osmond
j.
litolff
at
a
time
when
the
united
states
grand
jury
was
investigating
the
question
of
violations
of
the
income
tax
laws
and
other
felonies
under
the
laws
of
united
states,
in
reference
to
certain
officers
of
the
police
department
of
the
city
of
new
orleans,
these
particular
applicants,
petitioners
were
called
before
the
state
grand
jury
for
the
parish
of
orleans,
state
of
louisiana
and
interrogated
by
the
state
district
attorney
for
the
parish
of
orleans,
state
of
louisiana
and
during
the
course
of
that
investigation
and
interrogation
before
the
state
grand
jury
were
asked
certain
questions
concerning
their
individual
connection
and
operation
of
lotteries
in
the
city
of
new
orleans,
were
asked
with
whom
they
had
been
associated
in
the
lottery
business
in
the
city
of
new
orleans,
whether
they
had
ever
paid
bribe
money
to
the
new
orleans
police
department
with
or
anybody
had
paid
it
with
their
knowledge
and
that
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
the
subject
of
bribery
and
graft
on
the
part
of
the
police
department
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
presenting
to
the
district
attorney
in
the
sanctum
of
the
grand
jury
room
and
before
the
grand
jury
a
written
statement,
each
petitioner
respectfully
declined
to
answer
the
questions
claiming
the
benefit
of
the
fifth
amendment
expressing
the
specific
fear
of
federal
prosecution
for
a
violation
of
a
federal
income
tax
laws
and
other
federal
laws
as
such
answers
might
incriminate
them
or
intend
to
incriminate
them,
or
might
furnish
a
chain
of
evidence,
or
link
in
a
chain
of
evidence
which
could
become
the
basis
of
subsequent
prosecutions
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
each
petitioner
specifically
claimed
that
he
was
in
actual
and
immediate
danger
of
federal
prosecution
by
the
united
states
under
the
income
tax
laws
and
other
federal
laws
or
all
felonies
as
he
was
under
investigation
by
the
investigating
officers
of
the
united
states
of
america,
particularly
the
united
states
officials
concerning
the
internal
revenue
service
concerning
their
income
tax
returns
for
the
year
'48
to
'56
inclusive.
that
they
had
been
required
by
the
officers
of
the
united
states
internal
revenue
service
to
sign
waivers
against
prescription
for
the
statute
of
limitations
concerning
their
income
tax
returns
for
the
years
'48
to
'51
so
as
to
afford
the
federal
officers
an
opportunity
to
proceed
against
petitioner
should
any
violation
of
the
law
be
discovered.
at
the
period
of
criminal
--
statute
of
limitations
on
criminal
prosecutions
arising
under
the
federal
income
tax
laws
a
period
of
six
years
had
not
expired.
the
record
contains
the
four
documents
as
to
each
petitioner
consent
fixing
period
of
limitation
which
was
required
by
the
federal
officers
for
the
petitioners
to
sign
in
which
they
sign,
so
as
to
permit
the
assessment
of
any
penalties
or
fines
or
forfeitures
which
might
be
found
be
owed
and
due
in
by
the
petitioners.
that
the
--
at
that
time
these
petitioners
were
being
interrogated
federal
indictments
had
been
returned
by
the
united
states
grand
jury
against
the
members
of
the
new
orleans
police
department,
three
for
income
tax
evasions
and
eight
for
perjury.
now
the
specific
contention
and
the
--
mr.
eugene
stanley
no
sir,
these
men
will
not
under
indictment
either
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
court.
now
the
specific
basis
for
an
appeal
your
honors
--
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
cannot
say
that
but
they
were
--
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
the
record
does
show
this,
it
bears
out
this
fact,
but
doesn't
show
exactly
what
your
honor
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asks,
but
it
is
an
admitted
fact
that
these
two
men
had
been
engaged
in
the
operation
of
lotteries
for
years.
that
was
why
they
were
called
before
the
state
grand
jury
to
find
out
whether
they
had
been
permitted
to
operate
with
the
permission
of
the
police
department
and
had
paid
bribes
for
that
purpose.
however
neither
one
of
these
two
men
claimed
any
fear
of
any
state
prosecution,
my
two
clients,
but
they
did
base
their
contention
exclusively
and
solely
on
the
fact
that
they
might
be
prosecuted
under
the
federal
laws
for
felonies
which
might
arise
as
a
result
of
testimony
forced
from
their
lips.
but
the
basis
of
their
appeal
to
your
honors
is
this,
that
there
exists
and
the
record
bears
this
out,
the
contention
made
in
the
written
statement
that
there
exists
collaboration
and
cooperation
between
the
district
attorney
for
the
parish
of
orleans
and
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
and
the
internal
revenue
service
of
the
united
states
and
its
investigators
for
the
--
regarding
public
bribery
and
income
tax
evasions,
record
page
46.
mr.
eugene
stanley
they
said
this,
they
did
not
know
if
your
honor
please
the
details
of
that
collaboration
and
assistance,
but
they
did
say
this
that
the
state
district
attorney
for
the
parish
of
orleans
mr.
hubert
had
held
conferences
with
the
united
states
attorney
regarding
public
bribery
on
the
part
of
members
of
the
new
orleans
police
department,
the
record
bears
that
out.
well
naturally
what
the
details
of
those
particular
conferences,
well
my
clients
would
be
in
no
position
to
know.
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
the
bearing
of
that
fact
is
this
if
your
honors
please
that
i
would
just
if
your
honor
would
just
permit
me
to
make
the
statement.
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
will
just
say
this
your
honor
please,
their
pleas
were
denied
and
they
were
fined
a
$100
in
10
days
and
exhausted
all
remedies
in
the
state
court.
now
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
your
honors
have
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
under
the
doctrine
of
two
sovereignties
rule,
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
provided
for
by
the
fifth
amendment
protects
only
against
the
invasion
of
civil
liberties
by
the
government
and
has
no
application,
and
in
those
instances
wherein
a
witness
is
asked
questions
in
a
state
court
which
might
incriminate
him
in
a
federal
--
for
a
federal
offense
your
honors
in
feldman
versus
united
states
and
barron
versus
baltimore
and
brown
versus
walker
and
a
number
of
cases
said
in
my
brief
have
held
that
such
a
witness
could
not
claim
the
benefits
of
the
fifth
amendment.
however
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
in
those
cases
which
have
a
approved
the
two
sovereignties
rule
wherein
your
honor
have
held,
that
your
honors
indicated
that
that
rule
applied,
your
honors
have
indicated
that
there
was
in
fact
no
danger
of
federal
prosecution
in
that
jurisdiction
and
that
where
such
a
threat
did
exist,
one
way
or
another,
the
witness
was
protected
from
incriminating
himself
in
the
second
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
stanley
that
held
if
your
honor
please
in
ballmann
v.
fagin,
200
united
states,
page
--
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
--
that's
on
page
2
of
my
supplemental
brief.
to
my
knowledge
the
rule
if
your
honor
please
in
ballmann
versus
fagin,
united
states
versus
saline
bank
henry
(inaudible)
versus
united
states
196
fd
and
117
fd
was
to
the
effect
that
if
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
prosecution
in
the
second
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
stanley
that
was
--
minority
rule.
now
--
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
am
at
little
hard
at
hearing
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
would
say,
i
would
stand
corrected
and
say
that
that
is
a
minority
rule
sir.
now
i
am
going,
if
your
honor
please,
to
attempt
to
differentiate
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
from
the
situation
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer
which
i
know
your
honors
are
thoroughly
familiar
with,
it
was
decided
in
july
of
‘58
and
your
honors
held
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer
and
his
honor
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
delivered
the
opinion
of
this
honorable
court,
your
honors
held
in
that
case
that
knapp
could
not
claim
the
benefits
of
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
reason
that
there
did
not
exist
in
the
record
--
that
there
did
not
exist
in
the
record
any
factual
situation
comparable
to
this
whereby
knapp
was
in
danger
of
any
federal
prosecution.
and
your
honor
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
on
page
1508
on
the
advance
sheets,
of
course
the
federal
government
may
not
take
advantage
of
this
recognition
of
the
state's
autonomy
that's
under
the
two
rules
in
order
to
evade
the
bill
of
rights.
if
a
federal
officer
should
be
a
party
to
the
compulsion
of
testimony
by
state
agencies,
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
come
into
play
such
testimony
is
barred
in
a
federal
prosecution
citing
byars
versus
united
states
and
there
are
a
number,
there
are
number
of
other
decisions
such
as
the
macanese
case,
in
support
of
what
his
honor
mr.
justice
frankfurter
enumerated
in
his
opinion.
now
one
of
the
case
is
cited
in
support
of
the
two
sovereignties
rule
is
that
feldman
versus
united
states,
322
united
states
487
and
if
my
memory
serves
to
be
correct
and
if
i
not
i
hope
your
honors
will
just
know
that
its
an
unintentional
error,
i
think
his
honor
mr.
justice
frankfurter
also
stated
as
dictum
in
that
case
on
page
494,
“if
that
federal
agency
want
to
use
a
state
court
as
an
instrument
for
compelling
disclosures
for
federal
purposes
the
doctrine
of
the
byars
case
as
well
as
the
mcnabb
versus
united
states
case
of
what
adequate
resources
against
such
an
evasive
disregard
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
citing
some
of
the
minority
cases
originally,
united
states
versus
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
now
if
your
honors
please--
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
said.
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
if
your
honor
please
this
is
the,
this
is
my
position
briefly
in
a
nutshell
where
a
state
official
collaborates
with
the
federal
officials
in
an
effort
to
obtain
--
obtain
testimony
and
where
that
state
official
visits
that
federal
official
and
collaborates
and
confers
with
him
and
cooperates
with
him
in
an
investigation
with
said
federal
official
is
conducting
and
wherein
he
had
already
secured
indictment
that
that
state
official
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
acting
as
a
federal
official
and
is
barred
by
the
same
restrictions
and
the
same
limitations
which
the
federal
laws
drape
around
the
shoulders
of
the
federal
official
himself.
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
i
say
this,
if
your
honor
please,
no
deference
in
respect
to
your
honor
that
the
only
way
you
could
avoid
it
if
the
federal
prosecutor
is
seeking
to
obtain
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
men
in
the
federal
court,
he
should
obtain
this
evidence
through
the
investigating
officials
of
the
proper
united
states
department.
he
couldn't
force
these
defendants,
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
he
could
not
have
forced
these
defendants
into
the
federal
court
or
before
the
federal
grand
jury
and
compel
them
to
incriminate
them
through
their
own
way.
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
if
your
honor
please
i
know
that
nobody
can
show
what
went
on
between
the
united
states
attorney
and
the
united
–
and
state
attorney
--
mr.
eugene
stanley
yes.
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
that's
a
matter
that
your
honors
are
going
to
have
to
eventually
determine.
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
we
might,
we
made
the
record
as
we
best
could.
we
could
not
put
the
state
attorney
on
the
stand
and
find
out
from
him
exactly
what
conferences
he
had
with
the
united
states
attorney,
nor
would
the
united
states
attorney
had
to
divulge
what
conference
that
he
had
claiming
privilege
under
the
–
by
which
–
by
virtue
of
their
office.
now
if
your
honor
please
i
am
not
optimistic
enough
to
plead
that
was
my
limited
capacity
and
with
my
limited
ability
that
i
can
come
here
and
break
down
verbatim
or
break
down
all
together
the
doctrine
of
the
two
sovereignties
rule.
his
honor
mr.
justice
black
in
knapp
v.
schweitzer
pointed
out
the
splendid
articles
in
the
ucla
law
review
by
the
law
professor
who
traced
the
whole
idea
of
the
two
sovereignties
rule
and
who
respectfully
pointed
out
as
he
impressed
judge
black
with
that
--
justice
black
with
that
fact
who
respectfully
pointed
out
that
in
his
opinion
there
was
no
solid
base
or
foundation
for
the
two
sovereignties
rule.
that
a
man
should
not,
should
be
compelled
that
it
finds
no
support
in
the
common
law
decisions
and
that
it
finds
no
support
in
the
english
law
decisions
which
up
until
that
time
had
been
believed
to
be
the
truth.
mr.
eugene
stanley
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
eugene
stanley
well
some
of
the,
well
i
won't
detail
with
your
honor
please.
mr.
eugene
stanley
yes
that's
correct,
yes
there
as
no
federalism,
there
was
no
federalism
in
the
two
(inaudible)
in
the
british
empire.
mr.
eugene
stanley
right
sir.
mr.
eugene
stanley
now
there
are
a
number
of
a
state
cases
what
effect
those
state
cases
have
on
your
honor,
will
have
on
your
honors
i
am
unable
to
say,
which
have
held
that
a
defendant
in
a
contempt
proceeding
cannot
be,
say
--
of
contempt
if
the
evidence
to
forge
was
served
as
a
basis
for
a
federal
prosecution.
it
was
so
held
in
michigan,
it
was
so
held
in
watson,
the
florida
case
and
then
my
own
case
the
state
of
louisiana
in
the
case
of
state
versus
dominguez,
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
itself,
gave
dominguez
the
right
to
play
the
fifth
amendment
against
the
divulging
testimony
concerning
his
operations
of
lotteries
for
the
reason
that
dominguez
was
actually
under
federal
charges
for
violating
the
income
tax
law
of
the
united
states
at
that
time.
now
if
it
be
true
that
the
testimony
elicited
in
a
state
procedure
could
not
or
can
be
used
in
a
federal
prosecution
the
fact
that
a
man
is
under
indictment
justified
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
their
opinion
although
that's
stretching
it,
in
granting
dominguez
immunity.
but
i
say
this
that
went
to
well
known
lottery
operators
some
before
a
state
grant
jury
and
testimony
is
sought
to
be
elicited
out
of
their
mouths
and
from
their
lips
which
could
not
be
compelled
in
the
federal
inquiry
before
the
federal
jury
or
before
the
federal
courts
that
those
men
with
the
basis
that
is
laid
in
this
record
of
the
actual
waiver
of
immunity
against
federal
prosecution
should
be
permitted
to
claim
the
benefits
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
wish
--
mr.
eugene
stanley
the
basis
of
petitioners'
appeal
your
honor
mr.
justice
is
not
only
the
collaboration
between
two
officials
at
the
state
official
for
intents
and
purposes
were
the
federal
officials.
but
it
is
also
based
on
the
contention,
the
respectful
contention,
that
the
collaboration
which
existed
between
those
two
officials
plus
the
fact
that
these
men
were
under
investigation
by
the
united
states
attorney
as
well
as
the
offices
of
the
united
states
internal
revenue
forces
that
those
two
factors
in
this
case
justify
these
defendants
in
pleading,
in
pleading
the
benefits
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now
if
your
honor
please
the
time
allotted
to
me
is
very
brief
and
i
don't
here
to
take
too
much
time,
as
it
has
to
be
split,
one
hour
has
to
be
split
around
between
myself
and
this
gentlemen
who
represents
the
other
petitioner,
there
has
been
since
knapp
versus
schweitzer
quite
a
fit
of
jurisprudence
i
mean
not
jurisprudence
but
quite
of
bit
of
review
of
your
honors'
opinion
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer
and
the
yale
law
review,
the
ucla
law
review,
the
cornell
law
review,
and
the
harvard
private
law
review
and
for
what
it
is
worth,
the
offices
of
those
articles
pointed
out
that
if
a
factual
situation
was
presented
to
your
honors
wherein
it
was
shown
that
a
real
basis
of
federal
prosecution
existed
or
collaboration,
they
used
the
collusion,
i
won't
use
the
word
collusion
it's
a
rather
harsh
word,
but
when
--
where
there
was
collaboration
and
cooperation
between
the
state
officials
despite
feldman
decision
and
of
course
as
pointed
out
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer
that
is
very
probable
it
would
be
held
that
the
petitioners
were
entitled
to
claim
the
benefits
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now
with
this
brief
discussion
on
behalf
of
my
clients
i
apologize
for
my
lack
of
ability
to
give
you
honors
more
concrete
and
more
valuable
assistance
in
the
determination
of
the
principles
involved
in
this
matter,
and
in
this
writ.
we
express
to
your
honors
individually
and
collectively
our
thanks
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
for
having
been
permitted
to
make
oral
argument
on
our
application
for
certiorari.
mr.
eugene
stanley
i
think
i
have
about
six
minutes
if
your
honor
please,
i
just
want
to
point
to
your
honors
respectfully
that
at
the
time
these
interrogations
were
going
on
before
the
state
grand
jury
by
the
state
district
attorney
that
the
fear
of
a
federal
prosecution
in
the
minds
of
the
witnesses
was
not
anyway
doubtful
or
was
real
because
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
prosecution
for
any
offenses
against
those
particular
people
for
violating
the
federal
income
tax
laws
or
for
a
conspiracy
to
help
others
violate
the
federal
income
tax
laws
had
not
expired
and
they
could
have
been
subjected
to
a
federal
prosecution
for
those
offenses.
now
the
yale
law
journal
says
that
since
few
states
construe
their
constitutions
to
permit
a
witness
to
remain
silent
in
the
face
of
federal
prosecution,
feldman
may
frequently
enable
the
government
to
avail
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
seeking
to
exploit
that
decision
federal
authorities
might
prosecute
a
witness
previously
called
before
state
proceedings
to
establish
in
which
answers
were
compelled,
sufficient
to
establish
his
guilt
in
the
subsequent
federal
trial.
the
government
might
even
have
inspired
the
state
interrogation
where
cooperation
is
quite
common
and
collusion
not
unknown
between
federal
and
state
officials.
furthermore
the
latitude
on
their
own
initiative
(inaudible)
inquiries
designed
to
support
--
to
design
a
further
federal
prosecution
and
a
number
of
cases
under
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
doctrine
where
state
officials
had
cooperated
with
the
federal
officials
(inaudible).
now
we
find
ourselves
in
an
anomalous
position.
if
my
clients
have
no
benefit
for
the
fifth
amendment,
it's
just
a
question
for
them
to
determine
whether
they
want
to
go
to
the
state
penitentiary
for
committing
perjury
from
louisiana
or
whether
they
want
to
go
serve
ten
days
in
jail
or
whether
they
want
to
elect
to
be
put
in
the
federal
penitentiary
at
atlanta
by
admitting
certain
violations
if
for
that
testimony
would
be
excluded
under
subsequent
prosecution
against
my
clients,
but
my
clients
still
would
have
to
serve
ten
days
in
jail
or
perhaps
be
subject
to
repeated
rules
for
contempt
for
further
refusals
to
answer
the
questions.
thank
you
honors
very
much.
