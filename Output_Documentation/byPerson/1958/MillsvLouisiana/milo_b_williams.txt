mr.
milo
b.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
members
of
the
court.
i
want
to
point
out
at
the
inception
that
there
are
differences
in
facts
between
mr.
stanley's
case
and
mine,
but
i'd
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
facts
on
which
we
stand
are
stipulated
in
the
record
and
in
an
agreed
statement
of
facts
and
with
regard
to
record
number
75,
that
agreed
statement
of
facts
begins
on
page
eight,
a
stipulation
of
facts
and
in
that
stipulation
of
facts
are
the
facts
on
which
we
predicate
our
case,
and
on
page
five
of
my
brief
appears
that
he
was
compelled
to
answer
certain
questions,
under
circumstances
and
surroundings
existing
at
the
time
that
were
propounded
that
they
would
be
an
infringement
and
denial
of
his
rights
under
the
amendments
5,
9
and
14
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
is
substantially
the
same
as
mr.
stanley's
contention
expect
that
i
have
to
inserted
amendment
nine.
on
page
six
of
my
brief,
under
subparagraph
b,
petitioner
and
his
wife,
and
these
are
admitted
facts,
admitted
by
the
district
attorney
of
the
parish
of
orleans,
that
they
were
under
investigation
by
the
united
states
revenue
service
and
that
already
11
indictments
had
been
returned
against
the
members
of
the
police
department
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
for
bribery,
income
tax
evasion
and
perjury
of
false
statements.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
yes
sir
judge
(inaudible)
mr.
milo
b.
williams
no,
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
your
honor
at
page
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
of
my
printed
record.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
at
page
nine,
ten
you
will
find
the
entire
proceedings
with
regard
to
my
client
before
the
grand
jury,
the
questions
and
the
answers.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
yes
it
has
been
put
in
narrative
form
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
it
has
put
in
narrative
form
in
my
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
not
in
the
record.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
not
in
narrative
form.
no
in
actual
form
it
is
in
the
record,
but
not
in
narrative
form
and
in
my
brief
and
in
mr.
stanley's
brief
we
refer
to
the
printed
pages
of
the
record
wherein
certain
things
can
be
found.
now
on
page
six
of
my
brief,
i'm
a
little
different
from
mr.
stanley,
in
that
i
call
attention
of
your
honors
to
the
fact
that
immunity
was
extended
to
my
client
as
was
his
clients,
but
then
it
was
a
restrictive
immunity.
our
immunity
laws
give
you
immunity
solely
for
offences
against
public
bribery
and
things
of
the
sorts,
you
will
find
them
cited
adequately
in
the
brief,
and
doesn't
take
into
consideration
any
other
thing
that
might
be
admitted
in
interrogation
before
a
grand
jury
after
this
cloak
of
supposed
immunity
had
been
extended.
your
honors
can
well
appreciate
that
it
might
take
a
philadelphia
lawyer
after
you
read
these
immunity
statutes
to
understand
after
district
attorney
says
now
i
understand
sir,
you
have
been
granted
immunity.
he
might
think
that
he
has
immunity
for
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
stipulated
by
that
statute
whereas
a
matter
of
fact,
he
only
has
one.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
yes,
we
say
this
because
throwing
that
aside
would
be
a
violation
of
his
rights
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
sir,
plus
what
those
un-enumerated
rights
listed
in
the
ninth
amendment,
which
there
is
jurisprudence
to
the
effect
applies
to
these
states
as
well
as
the
federal
government,
as
you
know
there
is
jurisprudence
to
the
affect
that
only
the
first
eight
amendments
apply
solely
to
the
federal
government.
however,
to
continue
sir,
number
d
on
page
six,
subparagraph
d,
is
an
admission
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
that
there
was
cooperation,
collaboration
between
the
federal
government
and
its
various
branches
including
the
district
attorney's
office
in
new
orleans,
including
the
internal
revenue,
they
admit
in
this
agreed
statement
of
facts
your
honor
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
justice
frankfurter
you
have
suggested
that
where,
on
what
to
do
we
hinge
our
collaboration,
they
admit
it.

that's
on
the
bottom
of
page
15,
that
there
had
existed,
now
mind
you
this
is
an
agreed
statement
of
facts,
and
now
exists
cooperation
and
collaboration
between
the
district
attorney
for
the
parish
of
orleans
and
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
and
the
internal
revenue
service
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
its
investigators,
as
well
as
the
police
bureau
of
investigation,
in
reference
to
members
of
the
new
orleans
police
department
regarding
public
bribery
and
income
tax
evasion
and
that
the
honorable
leon
d.
hubert
has
held
conferences
with
the
united
states
attorney
regarding
public
bribery
on
the
part
of
certain
members
of
the
new
orleans
police
department
and
income
tax
evasion,
felonies
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
--
united
states
of
america
and
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
no
sir,
i
anticipate
that.
but
we
have
in
here
that
publicity
on
page
15,
paragraph
five,
that
publicity
carried
through
daily
newspapers,
television
and
radio
has
been
carried
on
for
several
months
regarding
the
investigation
embarked
upon
by
the
federal
authorities
into
the
income
tax
returns
of
some
members
of
our
new
orleans
police
department
and
that
was
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
as
mr.
stanley
has
pointed
out,
that
these
defendants
had
since
time
immemorial
been
engaged
in
the
business
of
operating
lottery
companies,
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
your
honors
there
is
a
difference
with
my
man.
my
man
at
the
time,
he
was
fined
and
found
in
contempt
of
court.
i
better
i
explain
to
you
our
method
of
finding
in
contempt
of
court
with
reference
to
questions
before
a
grand
jury.
you
are
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury,
certain
questions
are
propounded,
you
invoke
your
real
offensive
constitutional
rights.
then
you
are
brought
back
in
later,
at
a
later
date
before
the
judge,
who
has
charge
of
this
particular
grand
jury,
and
then
you
are
asked
in
effect
the
questions
again,
mr.
mills
do
you
still
invoke
your
constitutional
guarantees
and
refuse
to
answer
these
questions?
so
in
effect
those
questions
are
asked
again.
then
if
he
says
then
as
he
did
here,
my
stand
is
the
same
he
is
then
adjudged
in
contempt.
now
between
the
time
these
questions
were
originally
asked
and
the
time
he
was
adjudged
in
contempt,
lo
and
behold
he
was
indicted
by
--
no
not
by
the
federal,
he
was
indicted
by
a
state
grand
jury.
and
then
while
under
that
indictment,
he
was
in
effect
asked
these
questions
again,
and
he
still
invoked
his
constitutional
privileges,
particularly
that
fourteenth
amendment
in
which
he
says
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
due
process
of
law.
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
he
was
indicted
for
public
bribery,
the
public
bribery
for
which
he
was
granted
immunity
in
the
so
called
--
in
this
grand
jury
proceeding.
now
your
honors
may
say
that
his
testimony
under
our
statues
can't
be
used
against
him,
that's
true
that
it
can't
be
used
against
him
in
a
public
bribery
case,
but
what
about
the
testimony
of
others,
that
his
testimony
reveals
that
had
connection
with,
that
lays
the
door
wide
open.
he
can
say
â€“
he
can
say
certainly
you
can't
use
my
testimony,
but
how
about
the
testimony
of
the
other
individuals
whom
he
mentions,
who
are
not
covered
by
that
immunity,
and
they
can
put
him
smack
slap
in
jail,
on
the
testimony
of
the
others,
and
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
you'll
find
it
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
we
have
three
your
honor
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
--
we
have
three,
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
printed
record
at
page
21,
you
will
find
that
section
13
of
article
19
of
our
louisiana
constitution
reads
as
follows.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
21
of
the
printed
record
in
record
75.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
any
person
may
be
compelled
to
testify
in
any
lawful
proceeding
against
any
one
who
maybe
charged
with
having
committed
the
offense
of
bribery.
incidentally
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
fact
that
nobody
has
been
charged
with
bribery
when
he
was
being
interrogated
before
a
grand
jury.
this
says
testify
before
--
against
anyone
who
may
have
been
charged
and
shall
not
be
permitted
to
withhold
his
testimony
on
the
grounds
that
it
maybe
incriminating.
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
we
have
louisiana
revised
statute.
the
offender
under
the
public
bribery,
bribery
of
voters
or
corrupt
influencing
articles,
who
states
the
facts
under
oath
to
the
district
attorney
charged
with
the
prosecution
of
the
offense,
which
is
not
the
case
here,
this
was
before
a
grand
jury,
and
who
gives
evidence
tending
to
convict,
may
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
attorney
be
granted
full
immunity.
that's
not
an
immunity,
that's
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
attorney.
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
page
22
of
that
printed
record,
any
person
may
be
compelled
to
testify
in
any
lawful
proceeding
against
another
charged
with
public
bribery
or
commercial
bribery,
et
cetera,
and
shall
not
be
permitted
to
withhold
his
testimony,
on
the
ground
that
it
might
expose
him
to
public
infamy,
but
such
testimony
shall
not
afterwards
be
used
against
him
in
any
judicial
proceeding,
expect
for
perjury
in
giving
such
testimony.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
which
prosecution,
you
are
speaking
the
matter
which
is
before
your
honors?
mr.
milo
b.
williams
no
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
i
cannot
--
my
positive
knowledge
answer
that.
i
think
some
of
them
were
dismissed,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
i
really
don't
know,
but
at
the
time
my
brief
was
written,
it
was
alive,
but
i
believe
that
they
have,
some
of
them
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
provided
it
wasn't
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
but
here
we
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
well
in
this
particular
case,
in
number
75,
we
ask
your
honors
to
consider
something
else,
and
that
is
the
civil
aspect
of
it
and
therein
lies
the
difference
between
mr.
stanley's
case
and
mine.
in
the
admitted
state
of
facts,
the
stipulation
of
facts,
in
the
printed
record,
on
page
16,
that
at
the
time
this
grand
jury
interrogation,
there
was
on
file
in
the
criminal
district
court
for
the
parish
of
orleans
the
following
cases,
involving
alleged
violations
of
louisiana
revised
statute
51281
and
i
list
them,
then
at
the
time
of
this
grand
jury
investigation,
the
civil
district
court
had
on
file
in
new
orleans
the
following
cases
for
occupational
licenses,
for
occupations
similar
and
identical
with
the
occupation
suggested
to
these
to
have
been
the
defendants
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury
investigation.
now
our
point
is
this.
that
if
he
had
answered
the
question,
which
he
refused
to
answer,
he
would
have
laid
himself
liable
for
prosecution
under
a
state
statute
not
covered
by
the
immunity
statutes,
which
requires
that
any
individual
operating
under
a
trade
name
is
required
to
register
milo
b.
williams
operating
as
the
xyz
company,
and
none
of
these
men
had
done
that,
and
if
they
had
been
compelled
to
answer
the
questions
propounded
to
them
in
the
grand
jury,
then
they
would
have
laid
themselves
liable
to
a
prosecution
under
the
state
law
for
that.
now
if
your
honors
will
look
at
page
--
how
is
that?
mr.
milo
b.
williams
prohibits
the
operation
of
a
company.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
by
an
individual
operating
under
a
company
name.
let
us
say
that
i,
milo
b.
williams,
decided
to
operate
a
lottery
company
under
the
name
of
the
golden
bell,
i
would
be
required
by
our
law
to
register
that
milo
b.
williams
is
operating
a
company
under
the
name
of
golden
bell.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
yes
sir.
now
if
your
honors
will
looks
a
page
15
of
my
brief.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
yes
sir,
i
have
it
at
page
--
it
is
not
quoted,
no
sir,
i
referred
to
it,
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
in
my
brief.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
no,
it's
just
for
operating
any
company.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
any
kind
of
company.
it
might
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
business,
but
if
i
as
an
individual
operate
under
a
company
name,
in
other
words,
conceal
who
the
true
owner
of
the
business
is,
it's
my
duty
and
under
the
law
i
have
to
register
that
i,
milo
b.
williams
is
operating
under
the
name
of
the
xyz
company.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
it's
a
misdemeanor,
yes
sir.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
yes
sir,
that's
what
it
is
justice
whittaker.
no
in
addition
to
that,
or
let
me
go
back
to
this
page
15
of
my
brief
and
i
cite
you,
it
goes
back
a
long
way,
and
that
is
ehrenberg,
that
in
the
question
be
of
such
description
that
the
answer
to
it
may
or
may
not
criminate
the
witness
according
to
the
(inaudible)
order
of
that
answer
it
must
rest
with
himself
who
alone
can
tell
what
it
would
be
to
answer
the
question
or
not.
if
in
such
a
case
he
say
upon
his
own
that
his
answer
would
criminate
him,
the
court
can
demand
no
other
testimony
of
the
fact
and
that
was
justice
marshall
way
back
in
ehrenberg
case.
now
i
am
going
to
show
you
if
you
gentlemen
will
permit
me,
by
these,
on
page
15
by
these
hypothetical
cases
what
could
take
place
under
the
hope
of
(inaudible)
immunity.
example
one,
witness
x
before
a
grand
jury
investigation,
investigating
public
bribery,
is
told
that
he
has
immunity
under
those
statutes
which
i
read
to
your
honors
and
the
following
ensues.
question
-
do
you
know
officers,
police
officers
a
and
b,
answer
yes.
question
-
did
you
ever
give
them
any
money,
answer,
yes.
question
-
for
what
purpose?
so
they
wouldn't
raid
my
gambling
house.
what
happens
now?
x
is
not
charged
with
bribery
for
which
he
has
immunity
under
those
statutes,
but
he
is
charged
with
a
revised
statute
1490,
the
gambling
statute.
his
testimony
is
not
used
against
him,
but
the
testimony
of
a
and
b
is
used
against
him.
and
how
did
they
get
the
a
and
b
as
witnesses,
only
as
a
result
of
that
grand
jury
investigation
on
something
else,
where
he
was
cloaked
with
this
set
of
bribe
immunity.
the
result
he
is
convicted
of
an
offense
of
which
the
grand
jury
had
no
knowledge
until
drawn
from
him
under
that
pretext
of
immunity.
now
example
two
is
even
more
serious,
policeman
a
has
been
shot
by
person
or
persons
unknown.
witness
x
appears
before
a
grand
jury
investigating
public
bribery
just
as
this
one.
witness,
he
is
loaned
into
a
sense
of
security
with
the
immunity
routine
and
this
ensues.
question
-
did
you
pay
any
money
to
any
policeman.
yes
sir;
to
whom,
policeman
a;
why,
so
he
wouldn't
raid
my
handbook.
what
did
he
do
with
the
money?
he
didn't
do
anything
but
raised
hell
that
it
wasn't
enough.
did
you
give
him
anymore?
no.
he
started
to
arrest
me
and
i
shot
him.
if
anything
more
he
added
to
say,
but
to
observe
that
but
except
for
this
blanket
of
spurious
immunity
well
for
which
the
grand
jury
wrapped
this
witness
x
of,
if
you
are
a
policeman
a,
would
still
be
a
policeman
or
no.
now
example
three
is
drawn
from
actual
questions
before
the
grand
jury
and
i
have
already
called
your
honor's
attention
to
that
fact.
the
question
as
it
appears
on
page
17
on
my
brief
will
be
exactly
as
was
propounded
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
mr.
nelson
and
the
answer
will
be
as
it
might
have
been,
had
my
client
accepted
that
spurious
cloak
of
immunity.
the
question,
mr.
mills
as
you
already
know,
this
jury
is
inquiring
into
the
lottery
operation
from
1950
to
1955,
and
that
is
what
we
would
like
to
talk
to
you
about.
what
was
your
employment
from
1950
to
1955?
well
then
the
grand
jury
investigation
he
invoked
the
fifth
and
the
fourteen
amendments.
mr.
milo
b.
williams
i
think
so
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that's
depriving
you
of
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
that
it's
been
very
aptly
pointed
out
your
honors,
its
in
the,
its
in
the
feldman
case.
here
it
is,
it
was
very
aptly
pointed
out
in
justice
black's
--
mr.
milo
b.
williams
that
was
a
dissent
i
understand
that
justice,
but
what
you
said
in
that
encoding
boyd
versus
united
states
i
think
still
stands.
in
boyd
versus
united
states
that
any
compulsory
discovery
by
starting
the
party's
oath
is
contrary
to
the
principles
of
free
government,
it
is
a
bar
to
the
instincts
of
america.
it
may
suit
the
purpose
of
dissipating
power
but
it
cannot
abide
the
pure
atmosphere
of
personal
and
political
freedom
and
i
think
those
words
were
well
said.
but
justice
frankfurter
has
cited
with
approval
what
was
said
in
the
murdoch
case,
the
principle
established
answering
justice
harlan
is
a
full
and
complete
immunity
against
prosecution
by
the
government
compelling
the
witness
to
answer
is
equivalent
to
the
protection
furnished
by
the
rule
against
compulsory
self
incrimination.
but
the
immunity
statutes
of
the
louisiana
don't
give
you
that
full
and
complete
immunity
and
if
justice
harlan
as
you
suggested
we
had
none
then
that
exactly
would
be
violation
of
the
due
process
of
law
guaranteed
to
us
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
if
your
honors,
i
didn't
go
any
further
on
that,
the
answer
of
mr.
mills
a
hypothetical
answer
to
that
question
that
was
actually
propounded
to
him,
i
had
golden
bell
lottery
and
what
happens
on
page
17
i
suggest
that
what
happens
actually
did
happen.
i
cited
to
you
those
cases
that
were
actually
filed
for
the
violation
of
that
particular
fictitious
name
registration
and
i
cite
them
now.
we
believe
though
that
this
particular
judgment
with
regard
to
my
client
mills
is
contrary
to
amendment
9
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
reads
the
enumeration
and
the
constitution
of
certain
rights
shall
not
be
construed
to
deny
or
disparage
others
routine
by
the
people.
now
i
am
sure
that
justice
clark
is
well
acquainted
with
mr.
bennett
patterson.
i
don't
know
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
very
illuminating
book
that
he
wrote
called
the
forgotten
ninth
amendment
and
i
quote
that,
part,
relative
to
part
that
is
applicable
to
our
case
on
page
19
of
my
brief
and
i
also
cite
that
the
ninth
amendment
applies
to
states
which
this
court
has
held
in
(inaudible)
versus
district
court
and
in
falco
versus
connecticut.
now
what
are
some
of
these
unenumerated
rights?
it
must
be
conceded,
now
this
is
savings
and
loan
versus
topeka
and
everson
v.
board
of
education,
it
must
be
conceded
that
there
are
such
rights
in
every
free
government
beyond
the
control
of
the
state
a
government
which
recognizes
no
such
right,
which
held
the
lives
of
liberty
and
the
property
of
its
citizens
subject
at
all
times
to
the
absolute
disposition
and
unlimited
control
of
even
the
most
democratic
depository
of
power
is
after
all
but
a
despotism.
now
suppose
the
louisiana
or
any
other
states
should
enact
a
statute
enabling
one
with
a
fancy
claim
against
another
to
require
that
other
person
to
disclose
to
him,
justice
black
that's
on
page
20,
to
disclose
to
him
detail
--
all
details
of
that
transactions
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
suit.
there
is
no
probation
in
any
constitution
against
any
really
--
such
ridiculous
procedure,
but
the
right
of
privacy
as
to
business
transactions
until
added
by
due
process
of
law
in
inherent
in
all
individuals.
will
there
be
any
doubt
what
your
honors
would
do
with
such
a
statute,
yet
that
is
exactly
the
situation
with
regard
to
my
client
in
number
75.
if
this
petitioner
were
forced
under
the
provisions
of
the
louisiana
constitution
and
revised
statutes
to
answer
the
question
about
his
occupation
during
1950
to
1955,
the
one
that
i
read
to
your
honors,
and
other
questions
that
would
inheritably
have
followed
the
provisions
right
upon
by
the
grand
jury
would
in
effect
become
just
such
as
hypothetical
statute
as
suggested
above.
but
petitioner
might
then
lay
himself
liable
to
a
multiplicity
of
suits
and
actions,
including
suits
by
the
united
states
government,
for
income
tax,
gambling
tax,
gambling
stamp
and
so
on,
none
of
which
would
have
ever
been
instituted,
but
for
that
answer
extracted
for
him
under
the
cloak
of
fancied
immunity.
now
that's
not
a
hypothetical
case
that
i'm
suggesting.
it
actually
happened
in
new
orleans
and
as
i
show
you
on
page
21
of
my
brief,
as
substantiated
by
the
admitted
state
of
the
facts,
in
the
printed
record,
these
suits
were
filed
for
occupational
licenses
by
the
city
of
new
orleans
against
men
engaged
in
similar
businesses
as
was
my
client.
in
fact
one
of
them
was
his
son,
august
j.
mills
jr.
i
won't
take
anymore
of
your
honor's
time,
except
to
thank
you
for
the
privilege
of
having
this
oral
argument
and
to
point
out
once
more
that,
that
forgotten
ninth
amendment
is
worthy
of
considerable
thought
and
is
applicable
to
both
states
and
the
federal
government,
thank
you
sir.
