mr.
j.
david
mcneill
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
let
me
say
in
the
beginning
that
i
certainly
appreciate
also
the
opportunity
of
appearing
here
before
the
court
and
presenting
our
position.
i
think
for
just
a
few
moments
i
would
like
to
summarize
briefly
and
a
few
observations
what
seems
to
be
the
issue
in
the
case
here.
i
think
we're
confronted
here
with
a
very
narrow
issue
in
a
very
broad
field
and
the
issue
seems
to
be
this.
from
the
holding
of
the
court
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer,
the
door
was
left
open
for
a
situation
where
there
might
be
such
collaboration
between
the
federal
and
the
state
authorities
as
to
vitiate
any
testimony
elicited
under
immunity
statutes.
the
knapp
case
was
almost
a
parallel
case
in
this,
knapp
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
declined
to
testify
even
though
he
had
been
given
immunity
and
he
was
convicted
of
contempt,
just
as
the
defendants
in
these
cases
were
convicted,
and
the
doors
as
i
say
was
left
open
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
a
proper
case
any
collaboration
between
state
and
federal
authorities
would
vitiate
such
testimony.
now
the
question
we're
confronted
with
it
seems
to
me
is
this,
there
are
two
phases
to
it;
one
assuming
that
there
was
such
collaboration
and
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
described
it
as
illicit
acquisition,
i
think
the
collaboration
or
cooperation
would
have
to
be
of
such
nature,
as
to
be
an
illicit
acquisition
type,
in
order
to
vitiate
the
testimony.
but
assuming
that
there
was
such
collaboration,
the
question
then
would
be,
would
the
court
here
stop
the
state
from
compelling
the
testimony
under
the
immunity
granted
by
the
state,
or
would
the
court
here
simply
say
that
any
such
testimony
elicited
under
the
immunity
statute,
could
not
thereafter
be
introduced
in
evidence
in
a
federal
prosecution.
now
that's
what
was
done
in
the
feldman
case.
the
court
said
that
evidence
elicited
in
that
manner
can
be
used
in
a
subsequent
prosecution.
the
question
before
the
court
today
is,
if
this
testimony,
which
the
defendants
mills
and
so
on
declined
to
give
under
the
immunity
granted
by
the
state,
if
that
testimony
was
obtained
by
forcing
such
testimony,
would
the
court
here
restrain
the
state
of
louisiana
from
going
on
and
compelling
it
or
would
the
court
say
that,
that
testimony
possibly
might
not
be
used
in
a
subsequent
federal
prosecution.
now
reviewing
the
facts
on
the
basis
of
that
proposition,
we
have
a
stipulation
in
the
transcript
which
has
been
referred
to
by
mr.
stanley
and
mr.
williams,
agreed
to
between
the
district
attorney
and
counsel
for
the
defense
and
the
only
three
points
there
that
i'll
call
the
court's
attention
to,
that
in
any
way
relates
to
the
collaboration
and
cooperation,
those
three
points
are
these.
one
there
were
conferences
admitted
between
the
federal
district
attorney
and
the
state
district
attorney
with
reference
not
to
these
defendants,
not
to
these
defendants
who
are
lottery
operators,
but
to
certain
members
of
the
police
department
of
the
city
of
new
orleans,
now
that's
as
far
as
you
go.
there
was
no
collaboration,
no
cooperation
with
reference
to
any
information
by
these
particular
defendants.
the
second
thing
is
there
were
indictments
returned
against
certain
members
of
the
police
department,
not
these
defendants
and
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
that,
but
members
of
the
police
department,
and
then
the
third
thing
that
was
suggested
was
that
there
was
a
waiver
signed
by
these
defendants
in
connection
with
income
tax
assessments
by
the
federal
revenue
department.
now
i'll
go
in
sort
of
reverse
order,
take
the
waiver
that
was
pointed
out
by
counsel.
these
defendants
had
some
eight
months,
at
the
very
earliest
and
in
the
case
of
mr.
mills
it
was
some
12
months
before,
signed
a
waiver
with
the
federal
revenue
authorities
stating
that
more
time
would
be
allowed
in
effect
for
them
to
--
for
the
federal
government
to
determine
what
tax
liability
they
have.
now
that
waiver
as
i
say
was
signed
some
seven
months
in
one
case
and
12
months
in
the
other
case,
before
this
case
ever
came
before
the
grand
jury,
and
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
letter
on
page
80
of
the
transcript
of
mr.
stanley's,
the
letter
by
mr.
blake
from
the
revenue
department
address
to
mr.
and
mrs.
mills,
it's
page
81,
and
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
language
of
that
as
indicating
that
there
was
no
possible
basis
for
mr.
and
mrs.
mills
fearing
an
income
tax
prosecution
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
letter
they
received
there.
here
is
the
way
the
letter
closed.
it
is
desired
to
assure
you
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
office
to
proceed
to
a
final
determination
of
the
tax
liability
as
expeditiously
as
possible,
and
your
cooperation
to
that
end
will
be
appreciated.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
doesn't
suggest
that
the
federal
tax
authorities
were
in
any
sense
posing
an
imminent
threat
of
federal
prosecution
of
income
tax
evasion
by
mr.
and
mrs.
mills.
now
getting
back
to
the
cooperation
proposition,
i
think
your
honors
can
assume
that
that
in
any
case,
that
there
will
be
cooperation
between
the
federal
district
attorney
and
the
state
district
attorney.
if
there
is
not
that
kind
of
cooperation,
somebody
is
not
doing
his
duty.
now
the
federal
government
is
naturally
interested
in
income
tax
problems,
i
mean
that's
a
concern
with
all
of
us.
in
this
particular
type
of
case
the
men
or
the
people
that
they
were
after
were
the
policemen
who
had
received
the
money,
because
they
wanted
to
know,
they
wanted
to
get
the
tax
from
them.
it
seems
to
be
a
particular
problem
with
federal
as
well
as
state
authorities.
they
are
not
concerned
sometimes
as
much
with
the
actual
crime
or
violation
as
with
saying
that
the
proper
tax
is
paid
on.
mississippi
you
know
has
the
only
other
prohibition
statute,
but
they
still
tax
(inaudible)
law
in
mississippi
on
a
black
market
tax.
well
here
it
was
the
same
proposition.
here
policeman
who
presumably
have
been
taking
graft
money
and
the
federal
government,
and
there's
cooperation
between
the
state
and
federal
district
attorney,
wanted
to
know
how
much
money
they
have
been
receiving.
there
was
no
suggestion
of
a
threat
against
the
lottery
owner
because
they
had
given
the
money,
that
was
the
interest
that
the
federal
government
had
in
the
thing,
so
that
the
extent
of
the
cooperation
and
collaboration
in-between
the
district
attorney
and
the
federal
district
attorney
could
not
amount
to
illicit
acquisition
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
indicated,
would
be
the
standard
by
which
the
court
would
determine
whether
they
had
been
such
collaboration
between
state
and
federal
authorities
as
to
vitiate
any
testimony
elicited
under
state
immunity
statute.
now
the
third
thing
the
indictment
of
the
policeman
which
had
taken
place
prior
to
this,
i
submit
has
no
connection
whatever
to
the
issue
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
william's
client,
he
says
was
actually
indicted
by
this
grand
jury
on
the
bribery
charge,
and
i
have
to
make
reference
to
that
fact
because
it
might
play
some
part
in
the
court's
consideration.
actually
this
indictment
that
he
refers
to
was
not
an
indictment
for
bribery,
but
it
was
an
indictment
for
a
conspiracy
to
commit
bribery
and
a
question
was
asked
awhile
ago
what
was
the
disposition
of
the
case?
the
case
was
disposed
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
about
two
weeks
ago
on
a
clear
prescription.
in
other
words,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
held
that
all
these
cases
had
long
since
prescribed
in
the
indictment
which
was
returned
by
the
grand
jury
against
mr.
mills
and
the
policeman
was
thrown
out
on
the
basis
of
prescription
by
the
supreme
court
about
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
j.
david
mcneill
on
the
ground
that
more
than
two
years
had
elapsed
between
the
time
the
information
relating
to
this
had
come
to
the
attention
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
time
of
the
indictment.
but
at
the
time
when
the
grand
jury
asked
mr.
mills
these
questions,
he
declined
to
answer.
the
matter
was
taken
into
the
district
judge
and
he
was
asked
to
cite
the
defendant
for
contempt.
the
case
was
argued
and
then
a
continuance
was
asked
by
mr.
william's
client.
then
before
the
judge
can
hand
down
a
judgment,
i
remind
you
the
case
had
been
presented,
it
was
clearly
apparent
that
mr.
mills
was
not
going
to
testify
to
the
grand
jury,
he
was
not
going
to
take
advantage
of
his
immunity,
and
he
was
going
to
take
his
chance
of
going
to
jail
for
contempt.
after
that
situation
and
after
a
continuance
had
been
granted
by
the
court
to
mr.
mills
on
the
basis
of
his
request
on
account
of
illness,
the
grand
jury
brought
in
an
indictment
for
this
conspiracy
to
commit
public
bribery.
and
then
a
few
days
after
that
judge
cox
in
a
decision
which
is
attached
to
the
transcript,
made
part
of
the
transcript,
ruled
that
they
were
in
contempt
and
sentenced
the
defendants
to
10
days
in
jail
and
a
$100
fine,
but
i'm
pointing
that
out
because
i
think
it
has
no
connection
whatever
to
the
issue
that
we're
talking
about
here.
in
other
words,
the
indictment
was
not
something
that
the
supreme
court
referred
to
in
the
dominguez
case
where
dominguez
was
actually
under
indictment
at
the
time
he
was
asked
the
questions.
at
the
time
these
questions
were
propounded
the
defendant
moved
it
was
not
under
any
indictment
and
actually
indictment
didn't
come
until
after
the
fact
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
advantage
of
any
immunity
and
was
going
to
take
his
chance
of
going
to
jail.
so
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that's
presented
by
the
record,
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
that
would
distinguish
it
from
the
knapp
case
or
take
it
out
of
the
ruling
of
the
knapp
case.
we
submit
that
there
has
not
been
any
such
collaboration
and
cooperation
even
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
that
would
indicate
any
illicit
acquisition
of
evidence
by
the
federal
government
as
a
basis
of
this
testimony
to
take
it
out
of
the
ruling
in
the
knapp
case
and
we
submit
in
the
second
place
that
if
the
court
would
define
that
as
an
alternative
proposition,
the
court
should
not
grant
the
relief
as
asked
for
by
these
defendants.
in
other
words,
what
they
are
asking
for
is
this.
they
are
asking
to
be
relieved
of
any
obligation
to
testify
on
the
basis
they
might
be
prosecuted
in
the
future.
now
if
the
court
does
that,
the
court
will
be
doing
what
the
court
has
said
it
won't
do,
to
interfere
in
the
state's
administration
of
its
own
criminal
law,
in
the
interpretation
of
its
own
law.
we
say
even
if
that
situation
existed,
the
remedy
would
be
to
deny
the
use
of
the
evidence
and
the
presentation
of
the
evidence
in
any
subsequent
federal
prosecution,
such
was
done
in
the
byars
case,
but
we
submit
that
question
is
not
presented
today
because
the
facts
in
the
case
don't
suggest
that
there
had
been
the
illicit
acquisition
of
testimony
or
evidence
or
that
there
had
been
the
collision
that
the
court
has
said
would
vitiate
any
testimony
gained
by
the
state
or
the
federal
government
under
immunity
statutes.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors
for
permitting
me
to
appear
here
and
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
david
mcneill
mr.
justice
may
i
thank
the
court
for
your
extreme
consideration
in
having
continued
this
matter
so
many
times
as
a
result
of
my
illness,
i
neglected
to
do
that
and
i
certainly
want
to
thank
you
gentlemen.
