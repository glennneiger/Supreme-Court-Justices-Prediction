were
they
notoriously
designated
or
intended
to
be
accused?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
that
they
were
in
the
mind
of
prosecutor
equal
to
be
prosecuted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
bearing
of
that
fact
on
the
issue
that
you
are
presenting
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
go
your
own
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
that
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
held
there?
i
said
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
you
whether
that
was
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
minority
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
we
still
differentiate
between
a
court
decision
and
a
dissent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
we
still
differentiate
between
court
decision
and
dissent,
but
apparently
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it's
the
minority
view
and
then
don't
assert
it
was
held
here
so
i
want
to
know
which
it
is
or
are
they
all
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it's
because
of
that
i
think
my
brother
brennan
asked
you
what
preciously
was
what
you
call
collaboration
between
state
and
federal
officials
and
you
said
that
that
you
didn't
know
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
said
a
constitutional
right
you
must
have
some
basis
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
only
way
in
which
you
can
avoid
this
is
that
state
prosecutors,
united
states
attorney
insulate
themselves
against
one
another,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
are
not
right.
what
i
am
suggesting
that
you
must
allocate,
you
must
show
that
it
was
reference
to
these
defendants
that
the
federal
prosecutor
tried
to
use
the
state
prosecutor
as
a
tool
to
get
indirectly
when
he
couldn't
get
directly
that's
all
i
am
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
that
case
is
here
and
that
was
shown,
you
then
held
that
the
federal
authorities
use
the
state
authorities
engaging
and
then
hide
themselves
behind
them,
so
that's
merely
a
sham
and
a
front.
so
you
got
a
plenty
of
cases
and
several
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
held
the
testimony
thus
secured,
or
in
fact
secured
by
the
federal
authorities
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
a
buck-shot
charge
that
federal
attorneys
and
state
attorneys
talk
to
each
other
that
he
made
lunch
together
therefore
invalidate
every
action
by
the
state
authority
to
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
we
can
only
determine
it
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
have
federalism
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
have
a
constitutional
federal
result
holding
this
the
basis
of
holding
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
true
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
chancellor,
they
exercise
the
chancellor's
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
another
thing,
but
you
are
making
a
constitutional
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
â€“
my
i
interrupt
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
stipulations
to
fact,
one
would
have
to
read
the
stenographic
minutes
to
find
out
what
actually
transpired
the
grand
jury,
would
one
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
eight?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
questions
and
answers
printed
there
are
--
constitutes
the
material
to
which
we
must
go
in
order
to
find
out
what
took
place
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
not
been
put
in
narrative
form
reform
by
stipulation,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where,
that's
what
i
want
to
know,
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
your
brief
--
i
don't
mean
in
your
brief,
but
in
the
record,
is
it
in
narrative
form?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
only
would
relate,
the
point
you
are
now
making
relates
to
the
extent
of
immunity
for
prosecution
by
louisiana
in
the
state
courts,
in
any
event
it
wouldn't
go
to
federal
immunity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
would
you
been
good
enough
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
you
got
enough
to
give
me
the
page
on
which
this
admission
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
what
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
wait
a
minute.
would
you
break
it
to
us
and
say
what
there
is
as
to
this
petition,
what
is
there
to
be
good
enough
to
point
out
in
the
record,
activities
between
the
federal
authorities
and
the
state
authorities
relating
to
this
petition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
petitioner
a
member
of
the
police
force
of
new
orleans?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
your
immunity
statute
printed
in
your
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
it
might
old
immunity
statute
which
this
court
held
inadequate
for
federal
purposes
in
counselman
versus
hitchcock,
that
the
evidence
can't
used
or
that
he
can't
be
prosecuted
for
any
matter
of
things
regarding
which
he
gave
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
21
of
your
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
a
prosecution
of
what
you
speak
alive?
it
is
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
that's
not
a
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
prosecution
for
bribery,
for
public
bribery,
is
that
prosecution
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
might
make
a
difference
then
--
since
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
is
that
under
your
constitution,
and
indeed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
view
of
the
circumstances
that
you
narrate
these
--
in
view
of
the
testimony
he
was
compelled
to
give,
not
only
the
testimony
can't
be
used
against
him,
but
he
is
going
to
be
prosecuted
for
the
subject
matter
of
that
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
this
an
alive
prosecution
and
he
is
convicted,
then
you
have
a
case
as
to
invalidity
on
your
claim
of
that
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
as
to
the
matter
of
curiosity
whether
the
provision
in
your
constitution
regarding
immunity,
what
was
the
date
of
your
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
runs
back
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
before
this
court
held
that
that
was
inadequate
so
far
as
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
in
1890.
