mr.
m.
e.
culligan
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
first
want
to
present
the
compliments
of
my
attorney
general
mr.
jack
gremillion
and
express
his
regret
for
not
being
able
to
be
with
you
gentlemen
today.
on
my
behalf
i
again
appreciate
the
honor
and
privilege
of
once
again
addressing
you
in
a
short
period
of
less
than
a
year.
in
this
particular
case,
if
your
honors
please,
i
don't
find
any
case
that
is
exactly
a
positive.
i
start
with
the
premise
that
from
the
case
of
brown
versus
walker,
right
up
until
the
present
moment,
the
self
incrimination
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
fundamental
right
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
nor
has
it
held
to
be
a
privilege
in
immunity,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
that
has
been
a
unanimity
of
opinion
in
the
decisions,
but
not
necessarily
the
unanimity
of
opinion
among
the
various
members
of
the
court
over
a
period
of
years
since
twining
versus
new
jersey
up
until
today.
in
brown
versus
walker,
the
rule
is
clearly
stated
that
self
incrimination
was
merely
a
rule
of
evidence
in
england.
it
became
close
in
this
country
with
impregnability
of
a
constitutional
amendment
and
that
constitutional
amendment
as
your
honors
will
know
was
put
in
by
four
states
of
the
original
(inaudible)
as
a
restriction
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government
--
from
tyranny
by
the
federal
government
against
the
state
government's
citizenship.
the
principle
of
the
law
is
annunciated,
without
question,
in
wigmore
versus
--
wigmore
in
evidence
in
the
third
edition
which
your
honors
have
quoted
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer
and
which
the
rule
of
law
is
distinctly
stated
the
federal
fifth
amendment
of
course,
and
notice
wording
of
professor
wigmore's
evidence.
the
federal
fifth
amendment
of
course
applies
in
federal
trials
only,
nor
does
the
federal
fourteenth
amendment
make
the
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
present
respect
to
the
privilege
and
immunity
of
citizens
of
the
united
states,
so
as
to
be
protected
and
reviewable
by
the
federal
supreme
court
as
against
a
violation
by
the
state.
mr.
stanley
in
a
supplementary
brief
here
today
and
in
his
argument
talk
about
a
very
wonderful
article
written
by
dr.
grant.
dr.
grant
is
the
dean
of
division
of
social
science
in
the
ucla.
that's
been
a
pet
theory
of
dr.
grant's
for
25
years.
he
wrote
his
first
article
on
that
in
the
tampa
law
review
back
in
1935.
this
is
more
or
less
a
revamping
of
his
original
article.
however,
as
justice
frankfurter
called
attention,
he
himself,
talking
now
about
dr.
grant,
in
his
own
article
says
this.
the
most
remarkable
fact
is
that
not
one
of
the
cases,
now
he
has
reviewed
fagan
and
all
the
other
cases
mr.
stanley
referred
to,
he
referred
--
took
over
the
sicily
cases,
all
of
the
jurisprudence
up
until
1958,
the
most
remarkable
fact
is
that
not
one
of
the
cases
involving
british
federalism,
has
so
much
as
discussed
the
issue
from
a
dual
sovereignty
angle.
in
fact
this
maybe
due
to
the
(inaudible)
of
the
english
common
law,
even
as
applied
to
foreign
nations.
he
himself
admits
that
the
issue
has
never
been
discussed
for
a
good
and
sufficient
reason,
that
you
only
have
one
sovereign.
we
certainly
have
two
sovereigns.
in
fact
in
our
own
state
was
where
the
issue
first
came
up
with
dual
sovereignty
in
the
slaughterhouse
cases.
since
that
time
there
has
been
innumerable
cases
that
arose
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
in
civil
as
well
as
in
criminal
law.
davidson
versus
new
orleans,
(inaudible)
versus
louisiana
in
a
case
that
i
argued
here
about
four
years
ago,
state
of
louisiana
ex
rel.
francis
against
resweber,
in
which
that
same
principal
of
dual
sovereignty
upheld
by
this
court.
there
have
been
cases
all
over
the
united
states,
where
the
dual
sovereignty
theory
has
been
upheld.
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
wound
encompass
the
fifth
amendment,
would
throw
out
the
entire
constitutional
theories
of
dual
sovereignty.
absolutely
throw
it
out.
no
state
in
the
united
states
could
possibly
administer
its
own
criminal
justice,
if
that
was
correct
law
there
was
no
such
thing
as
dual
sovereignty,
if
there
is,
on
which
all
of
these
cases
have
been
based.
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
itself,
your
honors
have
specifically
held
and
in
at
least
30
cases
to
my
knowledge,
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
and
cannot
apply
to
the
states.
as
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honors
have
held
in
twining
versus
new
jersey,
palko
versus
connecticut,
adamson
versus
california,
the
last
case
knapp
versus
schweitzer
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
not
encompassed
the
fifth
and
has
no
regulatory
power
on
self
incrimination
insofar
as
the
state
itself
is
concerned.
as
to
the
use
of
the
testimony
in
the
state
courts,
i
mean
use
in
the
federal
courts
from
the
state
sources,
i
think
your
honors
have
definitely
decided
that
in
the
feldman
case,
the
bryar's
and
mcnabb
cases,
that
wherever
there
is
actually
collusion,
mr.
stanley
said
he
didn't
want
to
use
that
word
collusion,
if
there
is
actually
collusion
of
courts,
federal
judges
would
throw
it
right
out
the
window.
in
other
words,
the
district
attorney
in
this
particular
case,
the
honorable
leon
hubert,
was
a
former
assistant
united
states
district
attorney,
a
professor
of
criminal
law
and
is
still
professor
at
one
of
universities
at
tulane,
mr.
(inaudible)
is
a
high
class
gentleman,
the
united
states
district
attorney,
the
two
federal
judges
in
new
orleans,
one
of
whom
is
my
classmate,
(inaudible)
and
the
other
who
was
my
sponsor
before
this
court,
judge
wright,
certainly
wouldn't
tolerate
any
such
unethical
comic
by
united
states
district
attorney,
now
our
state
district
attorney
and
mr.
stanley
knows
those
gentlemen
and
their
reputation
as
well
as
i
do.
again
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact,
this
is
strictly
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
and
we
are
very
particular
about
our
grand
jury
proceedings.
we
weren't
so
particular
in
our
selection
and
we
got
thrown
out
on
that
nine
to
nothing,
but
as
far
as
--
i
reported
the
last
case
if
your
honor
please,
state
versus
(inaudible),
i
always
believe
in
taking
about
my
law
as
well
as
my
(inaudible)
[laughter],
but
there
is
no
attack
in
this
case
on
our
grand
jury.
there
is
no
attack
on
the
charge
given
to
our
grand
jury
and
our
grand
jury
must
charge,
our
judges
must
charge
that
grand
jury,
as
soon
as
they
sworn
in,
the
law
of
bribery
including
article
121,
which
is
an
immunity
granted
by
the
legislature
far
beyond
the
constitution
itself,
talking
about
immunity.
now
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
touch
on
this.
louisiana
is
one
of
two
states
that
you
don't
have
a
privilege
of
self
incrimination
at
all
in
a
bribery
case.
we
don't
give
it
to
you.
we
don't
give
it
to
you
at
all
in
our
constitution.
in
other
words,
louisiana
and
pennsylvania
have
exactly
the
same
constitutional
provisions.
our
article
i,
section
11,
is
the
same
as
pennsylvania's
article
i,
section
9,
which
is
the
same
as
the
fifth
amendment.
our
article
19
which
is
cited
by
both
gentlemen
in
their
briefs
our
article
19,
section
13
is
exactly
the
same
as
pennsylvania's
article
iii,
section
32
except
that
they
combine
in
their
article
32,
our
sections
12
and
13.
our
section
12
and
the
article
19
defines
what
is
bribery.
we
give
you
no
privilege
against
self
discrimination
on
bribe.
we
do
give
you
in
the
constitution
itself
the
right
to
that
testimony
alone
cannot
be
used
against
you,
then
the
legislature
to
complement
and
implement.
the
constitution
is
going
further
they
give
you
immunity
from
prosecution
under
article
121.
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
that
provision
constitution
date
judge
is,
constitution
of
1921,
although
you
will
find
--
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
it
runs
back
to
1879.
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
yes
that
was
way
back
in
1879,
is
when
this
provision
was
in
our
constitution
and
was
placed
--
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
i
was
just
going
to
mention
the
hitchcock
case
if
your
honor
please.
the
pennsylvania
constitution
was
in
1874
and
the
wording
is
exactly
similar
where
it
simply
uses
the
words
that
the
evidence
cannot
be
used.
later
on
this
court
developed
the
theory
of
evidence
(inaudible)
prosecution.
now
in
counselman
versus
hitchcock
is
the
only
case
that
i
find
where
there
is
any
mention
at
all
as
what
this
court
might
do,
where
the
proposition
was
not
the
extent
of
immunity
offered
under
a
state
court
statute
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
privilege
under
the
constitution,
or
where
it
was
actually
in
the
constitution
itself.
(inaudible)
in
counselman
versus
hitchcock
it
says
the
situation
would
be
entirely
different
where
that
was
done
in
the
constitution
and
reason
for
that
to
me
is
very
(inaudible).
if
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania
incidentally
they
set
a
philadelphia
lawyer
to
figure
these
things
out
but
the
philadelphia
lawyers
figured
it
out,
commonwealth
versus
haynes
is
the
leading
case
on
it
in
which
exactly
the
same
situation
took
place
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
as
we
had
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
graft
running
rampant,
playoffs
for
lotteries
and
rackets
to
the
police
department
and
they
did
the
same
thing
over
there
and
in
their
case
which
is
a
state
court
case,
the
lottery
vendors
were
charged
with
lobbying
right
in
time.
now
we
say
that
it,
we
have
a
right
not
to
give
you
the
privilege
at
all
then
we
can
abridge
it
to
any
extent
we
feel
like
it
and
our
constitution
does
that.
it's
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
our
constitution.
article
19,
section
13
is
the
exception
to
the
article
1,
section
11.
now
insofar
as
the
state
court
jurisprudence
is
concerned,
mr.
stanley
personally
handled
state
versus
(inaudible)
and
i
congratulate
him
upon
his
victory.
we
asked
for
rehearing
and
case
was
denied.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did
not
follow
its
original
jurisprudence
in
state
versus
rodriguez
which
was
the
seven
to
nothing
we
have
seven
members
on
our
court,
unanimous
seven
and
nothing.
state
versus
dominguez
was
four
to
three.
now
in
that
four
to
three,
the
case
next
came
up
which
mr.
stanley
did
mention
state
versus
ford,
your
honor
will
find
that
in
judge
cox's
decision
and
state
versus
ford
was
written
by
the
later
beloved
my
former
client,
justice
maurice
in
which
state
versus
ford
although
he
had
been
in
the
majority
opinion,
in
state
versus
dominguez
he
revised
the
law,
but
did
not
come
out
with
a
direct
reversal
of
the
opinion
written
in
state
versus
dominguez
and
went
on
a
basis
of
distinguishing
the
case
because
in
the
dominguez
case
the
man
was
actually
under
indictment
and
in
ford
he
wasn't.
in
this
particular
instance
here,
in
state
versus
ford,
state
versus
rodriguez
the
chief
justice,
justice
fournet
was
in
a
majority
opinion,
he
had
been
in
a
minority
in
state
versus
dominguez,
he
is
back
in
the
majority
in
state
versus
ford
and
he
is
a
minority
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
mr.
william's
case
our
courts
did
five
to
two
and
mr.
stanley's
case
five
to
one
and
justice
fournet
took
no
part.
that
briefly
as
far
as
the
legal
part
of
the
case,
as
far
i
can
inform
the
court
with
one
other
exception
the
only
judicial
interpretation
that
i
found
mr.
stanley
quoted
you
a
lot
of
law
reviews,
but
the
only
judicial
interpretation
that
i
have
seen
by
a
state
court
has
been
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
just
recently
handed
down
the
opinion
in
which
--
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
justice
caleb
says
that
the
dominguez
case
is
now
in
the
judicial
limbo
--
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
trying
to
use,
and
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
the
term
limbo
because
in
certain
religions
that
means
stay
and
(inaudible)
--
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
no
he
was
using
the
colloquialism
there.
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
yes,
that's
judge
--
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
this
case
yes
sir,
in
other
words
this
case
came
up
on
--
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
no
sir.
mr.
m.
e.
culligan
there
is
a
dissent
in
the
granting
of
--
and
in
the
refuse
of
grant
of
writs
by
judge
fournet
in
which
he
said
to
the
grand
jury
investigation
is
a
fishing
expedition.
now
i
disagree
with
that
statement
because
to
my
mind
at
least,
every
grand
jury,
it's
an
inquisitorial
body
and
that's
what
they
have
to
do.
also
mr.
williams
mentioned
the
passing
the
word
choice
used
in
our
constitution,
that
has
also
been
passed
on
by
our
supreme
court
and
it's
a
matter
of
our
supreme
court
decision
on
that
in
which
they
have
already
passed
on
at
in
states
versus
rodriguez.
on
the
factual
situations
in
the
record
itself,
the
executive
assistant
district
attorney,
former
judge
of
our
district
court,
mr.
mcneill.
(inaudible)
your
honors
i
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
honor
and
privilege
of
being
here
and
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
(inaudible)
