did
you
(inaudible)
when
does
the
--
the
statute
of
limitations
begin
to
run?
justice
john
m.

when
did
the
--
when
did
the
action
brought?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
that
issue
was
really
here
now,
what
you're
asking
where
i
take
it
is
to
let
this
case
go
to
trial
and
then
judge
the
sufficiency
of
the
fraud
or
whatever
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

after
the
evidence
was
in.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
it,
denied
your
--
denied
a
motion
to
amend
the
complaint.
there
is
no
amendment
to
cure
the
defect.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
--
does
that
case
involve
the
so-called
built-in
statute
of
limitations?
justice
john
m.
harlan

me
as
a
matter
of
interest

john
m.
harlan
--
your
plan
to
quasi
public
organization.

justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
fourth

the
only
one
that
has
gone
the
other
way?
