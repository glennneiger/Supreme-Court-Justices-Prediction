question,

may,
on
the
fact.
had
he
permanently
let
the
employer
or
the
defendant
when
he
first
discovered
his
condition?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
schwartz,
since
your
argument
has
already
been
interrupted,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
before
you
resume.
is
--
you
answered
--
you
answered
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
as
to
some
of
the
details
of
this
fraud,
who
made
the
representations
and
when
and
so
on,
you
very
properly
answered
his
questions,
but
am
i
correct
in
--
in
understanding
that
so
far
as
the
record
that
we
have
before
us
now
goes
that
all
we
have
on
this
is,
at
the
top
of
page
1
of
the
--
of
the
transcript,
this
allegation
in
paragraph
9
of
the
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
the
record
shows.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
have.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
--
there's
a
doctrine
--
at
least
in
some
states,
there's
the
doctrine
of
fraudulent
concealment
which,
as
i
understand
it,
arises
out
of
a
situation
when
the
defendant
knows
or
has
good
reason
to
know
that
the
plaintiff
has
a
cause
of
action
and
the
plaintiff
does
it.
that
would
arise
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
for
example,
if
the
defendant-employer
had
--
had
made
an
x-ray
of
the
--
of
the
defendant's
lungs
or
something
and
it
found
a
deterioration
and
damage
and
had
not
disclosed
this
to
the
plaintiff.
that's
fraudulent
concealment
of
a
cause
of
action
and
that,
at
least
on
many
jurisdictions,
will
toll
any
kind
of
a
statute
of
limitations
until
the
plaintiff
learns
in
fact
that
he
has
a
cause
of
action
but
that
doctrine
isn't
--
isn't
relevant
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
--
this
action
was
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
justice
potter
stewart
any
action
he
brought
would
be
under
that
statute,
wouldn't
it?
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
scarborough
case
the
one
that
went
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
three
times?
justice
potter
stewart
three
times?
justice

stewart
three
opinions
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
each
time
the
court
of
appeals
went
a
little
further.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
--
you
concede,
mr.
schwartz,
when
the
other
--
under
the
--
if
--
if
the
court
agree
with
you
on
--
on
--
that
under
the
federal
rule
as
you
would
--
to
inform
with
the
federal
rules,
you
--
your
complaint
ought
to
be
amended.

mr.
mattison,
in
--
in
your
reading
of
these
cases,
did
you
run
in
anywhere
to
the
--
to
the
distinction
that
my
question
a
few
minutes
ago
suggested
between
fraud
of
the
kind
alleged
or
suggested
in
this
complaint
or
misinformation
as
to
the
length
of
the
statute
of
limitations
to
--
in
that
kind
and
--
and
fraud
that
went
right
to
the
cause
of
action,
fraudulent
concealment
of
the
fact
of
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action,
is
there

justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
monument
you're
talking
about
is
the
--
is
the
distinction
between
the
--
the
built-in
statute
and
the
general
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
built-in
statute
was
part
of
the
right,
which
was
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
legislative
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
conditioned
upon
the
statute
of
limitations.
