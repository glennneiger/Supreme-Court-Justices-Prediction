justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
he
submitted
the
representation
that
they
have
seven
years
within
which
to
bring
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
all
three
made
this
representation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
over
what
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
beginning
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
last
one
was
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
in
1951
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aren't
you
up
against
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
earlier,
mr.
mattison,
that
judge
byers
did
tell
him
you
wouldn't
allow
him
to
amend
and
perhaps
on
the
premise
that
you're
making
this
argument,
namely,
that
fraud
does
toll?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
might
be
able
to
amend
if
he
had
the
opportunity
to
bring
himself
within
it,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
mattison,
not
to
pressure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
you
said
you
were
glad
we
had
not,
in
that
article,
for
example,
which
you
referred
us
to,
is
there
any
attempted
offense
of
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
run
into
--
in
any
source,
any
defense
of
that
distinction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
other
than
the
--
other
than
the
words
that
once
related
the
right
and
the
other
the
remedy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
are
other
federal
statutes
in
which
congress
has
said
two
years
and
no
longer.
