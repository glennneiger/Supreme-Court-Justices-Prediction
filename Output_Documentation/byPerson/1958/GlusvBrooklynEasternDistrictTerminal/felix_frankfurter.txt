justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
the
case,
is
it
relevant
to
the
--
to
the
determination
of
this
case
to
decide
whether
every
misstatement
is
a
misrepresentation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
--
there
were
claim
in
these
statements
as
to
what
the
law
is
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
what
you
said,
i
know
no
more
than
what
you
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
might
not
be
a
ground
of
what
normally
is
called
estoppel
but
misrepresentation
means
consciously
telling
something
that
you
know
isn't
so.
is
that
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
--
you
are
suggesting
that
i
am
wrong
in
my
assumption
that
when
we
talk
about
misrepresentation
in
the
law,
would
mean
something
more
than
an
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
against
misusing
words
at
misrepresenting
the
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
feeling
or
expressed
feeling
that
the
allegation
of
--
of
--
that
would
take
it
out
of
the
statute,
assume
you
could
take
it
out
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
could
be
slim
or
meek
or
inadequate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
they
didn't
go
on
that
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
fruitful
really
is
this
mode
of
argument?
i
know
it's
in
the
case.
where
do
we
really
get
in
using
this
kind
of
an
argument?
federal
employers'
liability
claim
is
certainly
a
noble
--
certainly
noble
in
the
sense
that
that's
the
first
time
the
congress
of
the
united
states
gave
this
kind
of
a
cause
of
action.
i
don't
know
anything
more
noble
than
--
than
the
statute
passed
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
in
120
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
is
that
there's
been
common
aid
of
comparable
causes
of
action
at
common
law
and
in
the
state
for
this
kind
of
thing,
but
how
much
help
do
i
get
in
finding
out
whether
the
statute
is
--
is
conclusive,
not
subject
to
any
kind
of
qualifications
or
it
isn't
by
being
told
it
isn't
noble
because
while
uncle
sam
never
gave
this
cause
of
action
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i
get
my
observation
by
saying
you're
quite
within
the
talk
of
the
cases.
i'm
suggesting
it
isn't
a
very
fruitful
mode
of
reaching
this,
whatever
answer
should
be
reached.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
get
much
more
help
if
you
marshaled
all
the
instances
in
which
statutes
of
limitations
with
reference
to
all
sorts
of
claims
or
rights
created
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
will
impliedly
qualify
by
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
in
leading
you
astray,
leading
the
plaintiff
astray
in
not
bringing
suit.
that
was
really
--
show
me
that
there's
some
basis
for
generalization
such
as
--
such
as
the
one
you
just
made.
is
there
such
a
body
of
--
i
don't
know
anything
about
it,
i'm
asking
you
because
you
worked
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
care
about
the
federal
[laughs]
--
of
all
other
statutes
you
bring
to
bear
to
--
to
make
your
point,
the
more
convincing
it
is.
if
there
is
a
thread
running
through
all
sorts
of
statutes
of
limitations
dealing
with
all
sorts
of
claim
in
which
such
an
implication
has
been
made
by
the
court,
that
seems
to
me
would
be
a
powerful
argument.
now,
is
there
such
a
body
of
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
kind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
so
unique
because
there
had
been
fruitful
many
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
in
the
second
circuit,
there
have
been
plenty
of
cases,
plenty
of
meeting,
half
a
dozen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
binding
myself.
i'm
trying
to
get
light.
i'm
not
trying
to
--
i'm
not
trying
to
fortify
conclusion
i've
reached
because
i
haven't
reached
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
might
take
care
of
your
--
of
a
purposeful
misleading
by
a
claims
agent.
it
wouldn't
take
care
of
a
stupid
or
an
officious
employee
telling
his
buddy,
"oh,
don't
worry,
you've
got
seven
years."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
remark
is
an
intonation
that
if
you
are
to
prevail,
it
must
be
important
for
this
court
to
indicate
to
the
lower
court
just
what
it
is
that
does
or
doesn't
take
it
out
of
the
statute.
i
don't
mean
a
comprehensive
enumerations
of
all
possibilities,
but
it's
one
thing
to
rest
a
false
representation
by
a
claims
agent
and
to
interpret
that
as
coming
within
device
in
the
liberal
sense
in
which
should
be
--
it
should
be
construed.
and
quite
another
thing,
as
i
say,
to
have
some
--
some
busy
body
or
some
--
any
employee
as
you
say
in
--
in
paragraph
9
unintentionally
give
a
--
give
a
wrong
stir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
wyzanski's
case
didn't
go
up,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
takes
as
a
little
--
it's
more
complicated
in
--
that
judge
byers
refused
to
allow
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
that
means
that
no
set
of
circumstances
could
take
care
of
the
arithmetic
thing,
the
three
years
that
elapsed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
--
but
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
case
that
comes
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
you
said
there
is
a
--
there
are
--
are
questions,
the
body
of
law
pre-fela
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
--
are
those
cases
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
a
specific
question
to
you.
is
there
no
--
has
no
case
--
is
there
no
--
has
this
problem
not
originally
with
reference
to
some
statements
made
by
a
revenue
agent
or
a
taxpayer
as
to
what
time
he
has
assumed
for
protested
facts.
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
looking
for,
whether
on
the
other
statute,
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
fela
but
having
to
do
with
the
kind
of
implication
that
the
court
do
or
do
not
read
in
by
in
the
statute
with
fixed
limitation,
apart
i
suppose
as
there's
so
many
things
that
federal
statutes
don't
have
no
statute
of
limitations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
(inaudible)
but
that's
--
that's
more
difficult
than
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
you
draw
on
--
the
word,
i
think,
was
the
things
or
the
circumstances
or
the
material
that
surround
the
amendment
of
1946,
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1939,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
surrounds
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
didn't
make
a
change
by
exerting
the
year
but
the
circumstance
that
surround.
now,
does
that
mean
that
this
question
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
could
also
tell
that
the
particular
few
people
who
dealt
with
the
subject
in
committee
didn't
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
anything
that
indicates
why
they
embarked
in
the
statute
of
theory
that's
before
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
happen
to
have
(inaudible)
at
hand
the
terms
of
the
provision
making
the
cause
of
action
not
--
or
dealing
with
--
with
the
effect
of
fraud?
do
you
--
do
you
have
a
sample
form?
what
do
they
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you've
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
makes
the
distinction
justice
brennan
made
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
there's
one
thing
to
--
as
in
this
case,
to
conceive
the
cause
of
action
arose
on
(inaudible)
certain,
and
is
there
a
reason
for
not
extending
it
or
extending
it
beyond
the
three
calendar
years
and
say
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
arise
until
there's
consciousness
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
that
he
has
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
that's
not
in
dispute.
it
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
the
suggestion
and
answer
through
an
earlier
question
by
justice
harlan
that
the
--
the
answer
was
explicit
that
if
the
statute
of
limitations,
three
years
(inaudible)
and
he's
out,
so
i
understood
mr.
schwartz's
answer.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
is
not
a
problem
of
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
that
is
not
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
does
he
do?
mr.
dawson
is,
to
my
mind,
one
of
the
curious
minds
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
does
he
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
conclusion
--
it
is
as
much
as
so
many
states,
a
good
many
states
have
dealt
with
the
problem
(inaudible)
statutorily
implication
is
that
it
ought
not
be
implied.
if
that
is
new,
i
can
understand
that
mode
of
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
mr.
mattison,
since
you've
opened
up
freely,
going
about
this
(inaudible)
one
should,
trying
to
find
underlying
reasons,
not
just
words.
if
the
distinction
is,
as
i
get
it,
the
distinction
is
this
that
if
you
deal
with
common
law
right
as
to
which
there
are
statutes
of
limitations,
you
may
imply
a
qualification,
namely,
conduct
by
the
defendant
--
the
--
the
plaintiff
--
conduct
by
the
defendant
leading
the
plaintiff
astray
and
not
of
saving
his
right,
that
is
the
common
law
right.
but
as
to
new,
newly
created
right,
that
doesn't
apply.
now,
that
means
to
me
that
as
to
old
stuff,
you
implied
fairness.
as
to
new
things,
you
don't,
which
isn't
very
satisfactory,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
--
you
said
something
a
minute
ago
which
as
a
lawyer
does
carry
weight
would
be,
namely,
namely,
that
after
all,
as
we
know,
most
of
the
members
of
the
congress
are
lawyers
and
i
don't
know
why
justice
--
judge
wyzanski
gets
the
confidence.
they
don't
know
anything
because
they
didn't
tell
him,
that
there
were
too
much
of
an
assumption
(inaudible)
but
in
any
event,
if
this
is
drafted
by
lawyers
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
for
years
and
years
and
years
is
that
lawyer
(inaudible)
leading
members.
you
tell
me
--
you
just
told
me,
there's
been
(inaudible)
that
congress
in
a
number
of
instances
did
specifically
deal
with
this
problem
by
writing
in
the
--
the
qualification.
now,
that's
lawyer's
argument
and
you
ask
for
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
it,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
goes
“concealment
or
absence
of
the
property”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
mean
that
--
that
is
in
justice
stewart's
corner
of
--
of
knowing
when
the
cause
of
action
arises.
