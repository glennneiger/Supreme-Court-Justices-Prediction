mr.
william
c.
mattison
may
it
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
mr.
schwartz.
on
his
appeal,
the
respondent
takes
the
precise
issue
which
has
been
delineated
by
him
and
by
the
plaintiff
in
respect
of
briefs,
namely,
whether
the
period
of
limitations
contained
in
section
6
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
can
be
extended
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
by
the
defendant
inducing
a
prejudicial
delay
by
the
plaintiff.
and
then
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
affirmative,
then
on
the
pleadings
before
this
court,
the
precise
transcript
which
comes
here
as
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out
in
paragraph
9
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint
at
the
top
of
the
transcript,
whether
the
representations
alleged
there
by
this
plaintiff
in
his
pleadings
was
sufficient
to
extend
the
statute
or
to
put
it
in
the
traditional
idiom
where
these
representations
sufficient
to
create
as
another
of
the
justices'
commented
an
estoppel
barring
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
from
pleading
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
he
didn't
refuse
to
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
in
his
view,
no.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that
was
the
correct
view
but
i'm
going
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
that
--
that's
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
that's
the
case
that
comes
here.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
no,
sir.
it's
--
it's
individually
and
--
but
non-publicly
held

mr.
william
c.
mattison

doing
business
in
brooklyn,
new
york.
before
i
address
myself
to
point
one,
in
here,
i
might,
with
the
court's
permission,
take
up
two
questions
which
were
asked
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
on
the
previous
argument
and
allude
to
them
briefly.
one,
is
there
a
body
of
law?
there
is
a
body
of
law.
the
body
of
law
goes
back
before
fela
on
the
nature
of
the
statutes
of
limitations.
it
goes
through
fela.
it
goes
through
the
text
writers
right
after
fela.
it
goes
into
the
1920s
and
into
the
1930s.
it
surrounds
the
amendment
of
fela
in
1939
where
material
for
this
appeal,
congress
did
only
one
thing,
it
added
an
extra
year.
then
in
about
nine
more
cases,
the
body
of
law
continues
up
until
1949
in
scarborough,
holding
as
far
as
our
research
has
indicated,
categorically
and
without
exception
and
with
complete
unanimity
that
in
this
type
of
situation,
fraud
does
not
toll
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
body
of
law
which
now
comes
before
the
court
in
our
brief
and
in
our
adversary's
brief
is
confined
at
this
moment
to
three
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
scarborough
case
which
went
four
years
through
three
spins
in
the
fourth
circuit,
and
as
mr.
justice
--
one
of
the
justices
again
commented
that
it
--
it
changed
each
time
but
that's
not
material
here.
and
then
one
more
opinion
by
the
massachusetts
court
by
judge
wyzanski,
and
that
is
where
we
stand
on
the
body
of
law.
if
i
may
again
address
myself
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
most
of
them.
most
of
--
when
i
say
most
of
them,
no,
because
there
are
innumerable
cases
we
took
to
the
convenience
of
the
court,
the
cases
that
we
thought
were
best
in
many
of
the
--
for
instance,
we
have
bement
which
i
--
i
can't
remember
where
it's
cited,
maybe
page
6
or
so.
it's
a
state
court,
i
think,
in
michigan.
but
all
through
the
states,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
even
for
instance
a
recent
case
in
new
york
which
involved
an
analysis
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts.
the
law
is
stated
to
be
categorically
that
fraud
will
not
toll
the
statute
of
limitations
when
it
is
practiced
by
a
defendant.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
your
case
did
not.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
my
answer
is
that
i
know
of
none,
but
in
all
honesty
to
the
court,
i
wasn't
looking
for
them.
and
if
i
did,
i
would
report
it
to
you.
i
know
of
none.
the
singularity
here
is
complete.
secondly,
if
i
may
again
address
myself
to
a
question
that
was
asked,
how
does
it
help
--
help
us
if
we
find
that
this
fela
is
a
--
is
not
a
new
statute?
well,
judge
wyzanski,
as
far
as
i
know,
and
to
some
extent,
(inaudible)
in
the
first
of
the
three
scarboroughs,
but
judge
wyzanski
very
specifically
said,
“why,
this
is
not
new,
this
is
old.”
but
we
have
cited
not
only
text
writers
but
the
supreme
courts
of
many
of
the
states
and
justice
holmes
in
a
--
on
oblique
reference
to
the
newness
of
fela
in
a
1916
case
in
our
brief.
what
judge
wyzanski
was
trying
to
do,
i
think,
and
what
scarborough
was
trying
to
do
on
this
issue,
was
to
refute
or
to
disclaim
an
ancient
theory
which
is
bound
up
with
a
litigation
on
these
cases,
namely,
this
is
brand
new
at
the
law,
this
never
existed
at
the
common
law,
and
when
congress
gives
this
legislation,
which
is
beneficial
and
beneficent,
it
prescribes
the
rules
of
the
game,
and
because
the
argument
was
that
it
wasn't
new
and
in
only
those
two
cases
have
i
seen
that
statement
made.
if
i
can
proceed
to
state
in
just
capsule
form
the
theme
of
my
argument
from
which
i
voluntarily
distracted
myself,
long
before
fela
in
1908,
the
traditional
distinction
was
made.
we
cited
the
texts
between
general
and
special
statutes.
general
statutes
are
the
ordinary
ones.
they
relate
to
rights
already
existing
at
common
law.
special
statutes
are
considered
to
be
those
which
are
contained
in
such
a
statute,
as
fela,
which
create
the
right
in
the
first
place.
now,
from
the
outset,
the
courts
construed
fela
as
containing
a
special
statute
of
limitations
only
and
one
which
was
subject
to
no
exception.
there
have
been
exceptions,
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
there
aren't,
but
not
justice
frankfurter
in
--
in
cases
of
fraud.
the
--
the
classic
exceptions
are
those
which
come
out
of
a
civil
war
case
in
this
court
where
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
took
an
ancient
maxim
of
one
of
the
european
writers
who
said
that
if
--
if
the
--
the
prescription
shouldn't
bind
someone
when
he
doesn't
have
a
form
available
to
him.
and
so,
in
cases
where
--
there
are
cases
we
cite
into
on
our
brief
where
the
plaintiff
was
interned
one
day
after
pearl
harbour
and
comes
back
and
the
statute
has
run.
in
that
type
of
case,
there
have
been
breaks,
chinks
in
the
armor,
one
of
the
judges
called
in
the
so-called
impregnability
of
the
doctrine
for
which
we
speak
here
today.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
1939,
your
honor?
the
amendment
of
1939?
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
what
i
meant
to
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
what
i
meant
to
say
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
i
spent
a
long
time
in
the
library,
as
i
think
judge
wyzenski
did,
and
the
truthful
answer
to
it
is
that
in
the
debates
in
1939,
there
isn't
a
solitary
word
about
this
doctrine
for
which
i'm
now
contending,
one
way
or
the
other.
not
a
word.
and
incidentally,
and
parenthetically,
judge
wyzenski
says
that's
--
that's
living
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
didn't
know
the
body
of
law
that
grows
around
fela
since
1908
because
he
said,
unlike
the
internal
revenue
bureau,
they
have
no
counselors
at
hand
to
--
to
advise
their
--
their
labor
people.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
he
--
that's
the
plain
--
that's
the
plain
statement.
but
it
isn't
true
because
the
--
the
cases
abound
in
the
state
courts
and
in
the
circuits
and
there
just
isn't
any
question
about
that
aspect
of
it.
we
argue,
of
course,
and
we
cite
sutherland
for
hornbook,
“principles
of
statutory
construction”,
and
we
cite
cases
that
where
the
congress
had
this
precise
situation
in
front
of
them,
namely,
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
for
so
many
years
and
the
decisions
they
must
have
known.
they
must
have
known
these
decisions
and
they
must
have
considered
that
the
decisions
met
with
their
satisfaction
else
they
could
have
created
an
exception.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
in
the
debates,
i
--
i
do
not
recall.
i
do
not
recall.
there
was
only
a
very
brief
page
in
the
multitude
of
pages
on
the
problem
dealing
with
the
enlargement.
now,
our
alternative
argument
is
that
in
of
any
--
in
any
event,
if
this
court
feels
that
there
should
be
an
extension
of
the
statute
available
here
to
the
plaintiff,
that
on
these
pleadings,
as
the
court
finds
them,
there
should
be
no
extension
because
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
in
its
opinion,
this
mistake
or
this
misrepresentation,
to
use
the
language
of
the
pleading,
could
have
been
a
perfectly
innocent
one
by
an
undoctrinated
man
who
was
speaking
on
a
matter
of
law
about
which
he
knew
nothing.
now,
addressing
myself
briefly
to
point
one,
i
remake
the
point
that
before
1908,
this
distinction
was
exceptionally
well-known.
the
courts
use
all
kinds
of
language
to
refer
to
these
statutes,
built-in,
substantive.
but
without
exception,
the
courts
held
that
the
statutes,
not
this
type
before
1908,
but
debt
actions
and
will
contests
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
those
statutes
were
not
extendable.
in
a
case
in
this
court
in
1886,
the
harrisburg
which
we've
cited,
this
sentence
appears.
it
is
the
--
this
court's
characterization
of
two
debt
statutes,
one
in
massachusetts
and
one
in
pennsylvania,
and
here
it
is,
“the
time
within
which
the
suit
must
be
brought
operates
as
a
limitation
of
the
liability
as
created
and
not
of
the
remedy
alone.
it
is
a
condition
attached
to
the
right
to
sue
at
all.”
i
cite
this
only
for
its
general
usage
in
the
approach
to
this
problem.
now,
in
the
mid-1880's,
when
statutes
of
limitations
generally
were
growing
in
the
48
states,
at
first,
the
courts
showed
a
marked
diversity
to
them.
but
later,
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
with
cases
and
with
text
citations,
the
courts
began
to
enforce
them
literally
and
where
exceptions
were
not
found
in
the
statutes
the
courts
putting
on
in.
in
1908,
this
body
of
law
was
extensive
and
so
we
argue
that
the
congress
knew
it
or
is
presumed
to
have
known
it.
we
point
out
that
in
central
vermont
against
white,
which
we
cite
and
which
was
decided
in
this
court
in
1915,
on
another
question,
namely,
“where
is
the
burden
of
proof
under
this
act
when
there
is
a
debt?”
this
court
said
that
in
enacting
fela,
the
congress,
knowing
the
decisional
law
on
the
question
of
burden
of
proof,
must
have
intended
that
fela
be
construed
in
the
light
of
that
decisional
law.
now,
immediately
after
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
and
judge
wyzenski
in
massachusetts.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
the
only
circuit.
immediately
after
the
adoption
of
fela,
and
we
cite
these
cases
on
pages
6
and
7
of
our
brief,
there
were
a
host,
a
legion
of
cases
dealing
with
fela
at
the
district
court
level,
one
right
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
morrison
case,
which
we
cite
on
page
6,
i
think
it
is,
cases
at
the
state
supreme
court
level
and
--
and
in
the
circuits.
we
quote,
at
length
bement
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
and
it
is
a
fairly
typical
characterization
of
fela
by
a
supreme
court.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
judge
--
in
--
i
think
32
states
in
the
united
states,
there
are
statutes
of
limitations.
there's
a
--
an
excellent
article
on
this
which
i
should
have
cited
but
it's
in
11
--
34
michigan
at
page
1
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
--
an
extremely
scholarly
article
on
this
question
of
statute
of
limitations.
here,
i
think
he
points
out
that
there
are
32
states
in
which
there
are
statutes
on
this
question
of
fraud.
but
they
are
the
types
of
fraud
that
go
right
to
the
cause
of
action
such
as
we
had
in
the
case
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
which
is
cited
in
their
brief,
and
on
the
concealment
questions.
it
is
--
it's
31
michigan
law
review,
page
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
1.
1
as
it's
found
but
--
page
591
at
sect.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
you
are
now
referring
to
statutes
in
the
states
dealing
with
fraud?
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes.
i
--
i
--
if
you
just
give
me
one
second.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes.
he
cites
--
professor
dawson
of
michigan
cites
as
a
typical
statute,
the
alabama
code
of
1928.
this
is
footnote
1
on
the
article.
it
reads,
"in
actions
seeking
relief
on
the
ground
of
fraud
where
the
statute
has
created
a
bar,
the
cause
of
action
must
not
be
considered
as
having
accrued
until
the
discovery
by
the
aggrieved
party
of
the
fact
constituting
the
fraud."
now,
that
statute
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
but
you
see
as
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
you
find
these
pleadings,
it's
ineluctably
clear
that
this
plaintiff
knew
that
he
had
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
he
doesn't
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes,
sir.
it's
right.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it
is
not
in
controversy
at
all.
it
is
an
issue.
it
is
--
it
is
admitted
here
by
the
pleadings
in
an
argument
that
the
cause
of
action
arose
in
1951
or
1952.
and
it's
--
this
has
long
since
bought
as
the
time
goes.
now,
scarborough
came
along
and
i
guess
i
should
not,
at
this
hour,
discuss
scarborough,
fravel
and
toran.
they've
taken
a
part
pretty
well
in
the
brief
to
the
extent
that
we
could.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
doubt.
there
is
no
doubt
that
on
the
facts,
the
cases
are
markedly
dissimilar,
but
i
must
concede
that
the
language
of
scarborough
is
so
sweeping
that
it
presents
a
precise
issue
in
this
--
to
this
court.
it
started
out
as
a
palpable
and
deliberate
fraud
of
the
worst
type.
and
finally,
through
three
jury
trials
and
the
exhaustion
of
the
fourth
circuit,
it
stands
--
and
i
must
confess
that
i
find
it
--
and
i
--
we
cite
cases
all
through
the
united
states
in
opposition,
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
all
you
need
is
a
statement,
mens
rea,
nothing
matters,
just
a
statement
that
is
in
fact
incorrect
and
reliant.
that's
--
that's
the
way
scarborough
worked
out
the
--
on
the
third
spin.
i
would
like
to
conclude
my
argument
by
addressing
myself
to
point
two
of
my
brief,
which
is,
as
i've
indicated
to
the
court,
assuming
that
you
find
that
fraud
or
misrepresentation
on
this
transcript
should
toll
the
statute,
then
this
is
not
a
--
appropriate
place
for
the
statute
to
be
tolled.
subsequent,
this
is
the
--
the
pleading
in
issue,
subsequent
the
plaintiff's
pleading,
subsequent
thereto
the
defendant's
agents,
servants
and
employees
fraudulently
or
unintentionally
misstated
to
the
plaintiff,
but
he
had
seven
years
within
which
to
bring
his
action.
the
court
has
already
started
out
from
this
appeal
the
fact
that
these
misrepresentations
of
successive
claim
agents
and
so
forth
and
statements
which
are
contained
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
examinations
by
doctors
and
so
on
that
that,
while
it
may
certainly
be
true,
is
not
before
the
court.
the
sole
and
exclusive
pleading
is
the
one
which
the
court
has
already
latched
onto
on
the
argument,
namely,
paragraph
9
of
the
complaint.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
he
might
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
not
even
the
remotest
implication
of
criticism
as
the
case
comes
here.
i
am
--
i
mean,
it
--
it's
unfortunate
that
he
was
told
that
he
couldn't
amend.
and
so,
i
mean,
i'm
certainly
not
taking
any
issue
with
any
of
these
statements
that
have
been
made
because
i
will
concede,
for
argument's
sake,
that
they
might
--
you
know,
they
might
be
true.
it's
just
unfortunate
that
as
the
transcript
themselves,
we
are
dealing
with
a
naked
allegation
in
the
prolix
language
that
we
lawyers
have
to
use
when
we
draw
these
pleadings.
the
district
judge
referred
to
hilliard
against
pennsylvania
railroad
company
there,
the
claim
agent
told
the
plaintiff's
father
that
when
the
boy
gets
to
be
21,
he
can
determine
for
himself.
that's
the
typical
situation
in
which
the
courts,
in
a
number
of
cases
which
we've
cited
throughout
the
united
states,
have
held
that
however
unfortunate
the
issue
as
it
was
formulated,
however
unfortunate
the
issue
be,
that
it
is
a
misrepresentation
of
law.
now,
in
scarborough,
of
course,
you
had
something
more
than
that.
you
had
a
--
a
--
an
inducement
to
a
--
an
unfortunate
plaintiff
not
to
sue
in
exchange
for
a
promise
that
he
would
be
paid
when
he
was
21.
toran
has
no
facts,
as
i
recall
it.
that's
right,
so
i
don't
know
what
the
facts
were
there.
here,
as
i
said,
we
have
no
inducement
and
we
have
no
exchanges
of
promise.
we
have
no
promissory
estoppel,
as
the
new
york
court
sometimes
call
it.
we
have
simply
a
statement
albeit
made
by
a
--
a
non-informed
and
perhaps,
an
unfortunate
claims
agent
or
whoever
it
was,
i
don't
know
from
the
pleadings,
it
could
be
one
of
three
people,
or
more,
who
said
to
this
unfortunate
plaintiff
it
is
alleged
that
he
had
seven
years
within
which
to
sue.
in
conclusion,
i
think
that
what
the
court
here
is
faced
with,
if
it
gets
beyond
the
pleadings,
and
if
it
satisfied
that
argument
point
two
of
our
brief
has
no
merit,
if
it's
--
if
it's
faced
with
the
decision
of
--
of
extending
or
making
a
statute
extendable,
it's
faced
with
a
--
a
monument
of
tradition,
which
perhaps
it
is
not
easy
to
--
to
defend
and
sound
logic
to
get
to
the
juridical
basis
of
this
distinction
as
an
extraordinarily
difficult
matter
which
i'm
glad
the
court
didn't
ask
me
to
embark
on.
but
there
it
is,
and
we
are,
and
i
think
the
court
is
and
congress
is
stuck
with
it.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
and
the
non
--
and
the
non-extensibility
of
the
latter
because
traditionally,
the
courts
considered
that
it
is
the
creation
of
the
right
within
the
statute
and
it
marks
the
rules
of
the
game
mr.
william
c.
mattison
cause
of
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
--
we
gave
you
a
lot
of
good
things
and
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
--
maybe
some
of
them
are
bad
but
this
is
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
(voice
overlap)
---
mr.
william
c.
mattison
fortunately
[laughs]
--
fortunately,
he
doesn't.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it's
an
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
in
this
article,
which
unfortunately
is
not
addressed
to
fela
and
its
problem,
and
for
--
for
which
reason
i
didn't
cite
it,
judge
frankfurter,
he
talks
about
the
ancient
origins
of
statutes
of
limitations
coming
down
from
edward
iii,
james
i
and
into
the
states
here,
and
what
the
equity
courts
did,
which
incidentally
was
pointed
out
by
you
in
your
opinion
because
they
felt
they
weren't
bound
by
james
i,
and
what
our
equity
courts
did
and
how
finally
in
the
middle
of
the
18th
century,
we
avow
of
these
statutes,
and
he
addressed
himself
exclusively
to
this
question
of
fraud
as
in
the
alabama
statute,
he
left
for
a
later
issue
concealment
which
u.s.
about
in
--
i
haven't
read
the
article.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
he
merely
takes
a
--
he
merely
takes
a
historical
treatment
of
statutes
of
limitations
which
we
lawyers
know
about
usually
dealing
with
actions
in
fraud,
and
he
traces
their
historical
development.
unfortunately,
he
doesn't
talk
about
the
distinction
between
built-in
or
substantive
and
remedial
statutes.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
no.no.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
no.
well,
there
--
there
is
this
--
there
is
this.
it's
perhaps
not
too
appealing.
you
didn't
have
a
right
x
at
the
common
law
and
now,
we're
giving
you
one.
and
we
are
a
literate
congress,
we
know
all
about
these
decisions
so
we
know
something
about
them.
and
these
statutes
up
and
down
in
the
united
states
and
in
england
have
been
construed
as
substantive.
if
this
--
if
the
legislature
doesn't
give
you
an
exception,
you
don't
get
one
and
now,
we
adopt
this
legislation.
we're
giving
you
something
you
didn't
have
and
we
are
following
the
rules
of
the
game.
it
is,
i
think,
one,
that
you
are
getting
something
you
didn't
have
before.
that's
why
this
emphasis
aren't
unique
to
the
common
law.
it
is
that.
it
is
also
the
ease
with
which
congress
could
have
done
otherwise
here.
for
instance,
and
i
think
it
was
--
pardon
my
pointing
--
an
1870
statute,
which
i
cite
in
the
footnote
and
i
found
another
one,
which
i
didn't
cite,
a
1930
tariff
act,
congress
went
right
out
of
its
way,
our
congress,
to
put
in
the
statute
of
limitations
an
expressed
statement
that
fraud
would
toll
the
running
of
the
statutes.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
yes.
well,
i
don't
know
whether
that
argument
appeals
to
you.
to
me,
it
is
just
atrocious
writing
to
say
in
a
nice
statute
that
you
have
two
years
or
three
or
four
to
sue,
comma,
and
not
after.
to
me,
it
--
it
offends
my
sense
of
--
of
precision
if
i
have
any
left
in
--
in
english
and
i
simply
can
understand
it,
and
that's
the
best
that
i
can
do
with
that
argument
in
my
brief.
incidentally,
it
did
appeal
to
judge
wyzanski.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
intellectually,
it
isn't
and
it
isn't
intellectually
satisfactory
and
i
--
mr.
william
c.
mattison
to
--
in
footnote
8
of
my
--
my
brief
--
page
8,
footnote
1,
i
have
only
one
footnote
at
the
brief.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
page
8
of
my
brief,
your
honor,
footnote
1.
and
if
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
you
would
like
a
citation
in
which
you
will
find
an
annotation
covering
the
states
dealing
with
a
problem
and
writing
in
fraud,
i
didn't
feel
it
appropriate
to
put
it
in.
it
is
15
a.
l.
r.
2d,
15
a.
l.
r.
2d
500
at
sect.
and
in
that
article,
i
think
you
will
find
mention
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930,
which
i
mentioned
briefly,
15
a.
l.
r.
2d
500
at
sect.
you
will
mention
--
you
will
find
mention
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930
in
that
article.
it
was
a
five-year
statute.
and
there,
the
congress
--
the
congress
put
in
the
words
"concealment
or
absence
of
the
property
will
not
toll
the
statutes".
so
i
have
at
least
two.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
it's
a
tariff.
mr.
william
c.
mattison
well,
i
have
difficulty
--
may
i
talk?
my
light
is
on,
shall
i?
mr.
william
c.
mattison
thank
you
sir.
i
have
difficulty
with
that
argument
because
i
--
here,
there
is
no
question
that
he
knew
he
had
a
cause
of
action.
these
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
thousands
of
them
in
this
michigan
law
review,
deal
with
actions
for
deceit.
and
in
each
one
of
them,
i'm
certain
the
plaintiff
didn't
know
that
he
had
a
cause
of
action
until
something
happened.
here,
of
course,
the
contrary
obtains.
he
knew
it
but
he
was
told
that
he
had
more
time
than
he
does.
