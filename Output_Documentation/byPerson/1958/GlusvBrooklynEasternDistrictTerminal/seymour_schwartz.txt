mr.
seymour
schwartz
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
dismissing
the
complaint
of
petitioner,
glus.
petitioner
glus
brought
his
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
in
his
complaint,
he
alleged
that
because
of
the
fraud
or
misrepresentation
of
his
employer,
the
respondent,
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal,
he
was
in
effect
kept
from
bringing
his
action
within
the
three-year
statutory
period
of
limitation.
and
that
for
that
reason
should
be
permitted
to
bring
this
action
nevertheless.
the
respondent
moved
by
motion
to
dismiss
plaintiff's
complaint
and
an
order
dismissing
that
complaint
was
entered.
no
answer
by
respondent
was
entered,
no
testimony
was
taken,
and
the
petitioner
had
no
opportunity
to
have
any
pretrial
procedure
such
as
interrogatories
or
depositions.
the
facts
in
the
matter
are
as
follows.
in
july
1946,
the
petitioner,
glus,
began
employment
with
the
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal
as
a
freight
handler.
his
job
predominantly
was
to
unload
bags
of
flour
from
freight
cars
which
came
into
the
terminal.
those
bags
of
flour
in
various
sizes
were
covered
with
paper,
sometimes
with
some
material.
in
any
event,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
flour
dust
in
and
about
the
area
of
work
where
glus
was
employed.
there
were
no
safety
devices
or
masks
issued
to
those
employees
working
with
the
flour,
and
after
being
subject
to
these
working
conditions
for
a
number
of
years,
in
1951,
glus
discovered
that
he
was
having
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
breathing.
he
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
his
employers
and
he
was
seen
by
the
company
doctor
at
their
request
and
his.the
company
doctor,
after
examination,
suggested
that
glus
be
assigned
to
light
duty
instead
of
being
assigned
to
unloading
the
flour.
however,
his
foreman
did
not
permit
this
new
assignment
and
he
was
continued
with
the
job
that
he
had
performed
up
to
that
time
as
a
freight
handler
working
on
flour.
in
the
years
1951
and
1952,
glus
made
various
complaints
to
his
foreman,
the
general
superintendent
of
the
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal,
and
the
claim
agent
of
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal
asserting
his
condition
and
stating
that
he
desire
other
work.
he
was
told
by
these
three
people
that
his
condition
was
not
as
serious
as
he
would
make
out
and
that
if
in
fact
it
was
serious
at
all,
he
still
had
seven
years
within
which
to
bring
his
action
against
his
employer.
i
might
parenthetically
add
that
the
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal
employs
men
who
are
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
under
the
jones
act,
under
the
longshoreman's
act
and
under
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act.
and
it's
quite
possible
that
even
attorneys
at
times
might
have
difficulty
in
ascertaining
exactly
what
act
covers
a
particular
employee
at
a
particular
time.
in
any
event,
in
july
1952,
glus
had
a
serious
attack
of
asthmatic
bronchitis
and
he
received
welfare
assistance
from
the
city
of
new
york.
he
went
to
the
greenpoint
hospital
as
a
charity
patient
in
brooklyn
and
there,
he
was
told
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
suffering
from
asthmatic
bronchitis
and
that
this
condition
was
permanent
and
progressive.
he
was
last
able
to
work
for
the
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal
in
january
1953.
and
since
march
1953,
he
has
been
employed
by
the
norcross
corporation
in
new
york,
which
is
a
card
firm,
in
their
warehouse
doing
light
work
in
decent
working
conditions
which
do
not
debilitate
him
too
much.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
from
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
the
disease
and
the
petitioner
acknowledges
that
the
--
the
statute
would
begin
to
run
in
this
case,
fraud
side
or
misrepresentation
side,
in
july
1952.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
the
action
was
instituted
in
may
1957.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
from
january
--
from
march
1953
until
january
1957,
glus
had
these
intermittent
persistent
attacks
of
asthmatic
bronchitis.
finally,
in
january
1957,
he
had
a
near
fatal
attack
and
spent
nine
or
10
days
in
the
hospital.
since
that
time,
he
has
been
making
regular
visits
to
the
hospital
for
treatment
and
injections
in
an
attempt
to
keep
the
asthmatic
bronchitis
limited.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
no,
sir.
he
discovered
his
condition
in
july
1952
and
the
last
time
he
worked
for
the
defendant
was
in
january
1953.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
his
work
record
of
course
during
this
period
was
intermittent.
in
april
1957,
glus
sought
counsel
for
the
first
time.
nine
days
later,
suit
was
instituted
in
the
southern
district
in
new
york
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
alleging
fraud
or
misrepresentation
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
in
this
action.
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
three
separate
people,
sir.
one
is
foreman,
two,
the
general
superintendent
of
the
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal,
and
three,
the
claim
agent
of
brooklyn
eastern
district
terminal.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
at
various
times
and
at
various
places.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
over
a
period,
i
believe,
of
months
or
a
year.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
in
approximately
1951.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
i
could
not
pinpoint
that,
sir.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
it
was
in
1952.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
i
do
not
believe
so,
sir.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
as
for
--
as
for
misstatements
as
to
what
the
law
is,
sir
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes.
as
to
misstatements
as
to
what
the
law
is,
i
would
say
depending
on
the
circumstances
and
depending
on
the
responsibilities
of
the
parties,
there
would
be
an
obligation
to
tell
the
truth
or
not
to
speak
at
all.
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
the
relationship
of
employer
and
employee.
the
claim
agent
who
probably
knows
as
much
about
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
its
statute
of
limitations
as
98%
of
practicing
counsel
in
the
state
was
certainly
one
of
those
--
one
of
that
class
that
the
law
intended
not
to
misrepresent
any
statement
of
law
to
a
potential
plaintiff.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
sir,
that
--
i
couch
the
--
i
couch
the
wording
in
my
complaint
as
fraud
or
misrepresentation.
i
did
that
because
i
did
not
know
whether
those
statements
were
the
result
of
fraud
deliberately
made
or
whether
they
were
misrepresentations
based
upon
an
erroneous
set
of
facts
and
erroneous
analysis
of
what
might
well
be
a
difficult
factual
determination
as
to
what
law
this
employee
came
under.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
my
understanding,
sir,
is
that
sometimes
it
might
and
sometimes
it
might
not.
i
know
that
the
term
constructive
fraud
is
often
used
when
there's
no
intentional
fraud,
but
the
negligence
is
so
great
that
the
court
chooses
to
use
the
term
constructive
fraud.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
exactly,
sir.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
exactly.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes,
sir.
technically,
sir,
no
motion
was
made
to
amend
the
complaint
but
as
part
of
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
they
said
that
an
amendment
could
not
cure
the
defect,
so
none
would
be
permitted.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
i
found
that
rather
difficult
to
analyze
myself,
sir.
i
think
that
very
likely
the
question
of
draftsmanship
was
involved.
this
--
from
the
time
that
the
petitioner
sought
counsel
for
the
first
time
and
the
time
that
a
complaint
was
instituted,
only
nine
days
passed,
and
that
was
done
because
it
was
felt
that
time
was
of
the
essence.
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
circuit
court
felt
that
the
mere
complaint
by
itself
did
not
set
forth
sufficient
allegations
clearly
to
show
the
fraud
or
misrepresentation.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
no,
it
was
not
on
that
ground,
however,
sir.
i
think
that
even
the
circuit
court
would
acknowledge
that
if
fraud
or
misrepresentation
would
toll
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
glus
should
be
given
his
day
in
court.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
that's
quite
correct,
sir.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
that
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
that's
quite
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
that's
quite
correct,
sir,
and
that
was
my
--
in
part,
that
was
my
reply
to
the
previous
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
--
question.
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
matter
at
hand
should
determine
--
should
be
determined
by
the
principle
set
forth
in
holmberg
against
armbrecht.
and
i
should
like
to
read
a
brief
portion
of
that
case
which
we
think
is
particularly
pertinent
here
so
far
as
the
principle
involved
is
concerned,
"where
a
plaintiff
has
been
injured
by
fraud
and
remains
in
ignorance
of
it
without
any
fault
or
want
of
diligence
or
care
on
his
part,
the
bar
of
the
statute
does
not
begin
to
run
until
the
fraud
is
discovered,
though
there'd
be
no
special
circumstances
or
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
party
committing
the
fraud
to
conceal
it
from
the
knowledge
of
the
other
party.‚Äù
this
equitable
doctrine
is
read
into
every
federal
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
sir,
that
case
in
fact
did
not
involve
the
usual
sort
of
statute
of
limitations
question.
in
that
case,
the
federal
statute
did
not
have
a
specific
statute
of
limitations
and
as
a
result,
the
court
had
to
resort
to
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
the
state
statute
of
limitations
was,
as
i
recall,
can
be
--
that
was
the
factual
situation
there.
we
feel
that
the
principle
just
enunciated,
covers
the
facts
in
the
present
action.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
no,
sir.
that
--
that's
completely
different.
i
cite
--
i
cite
this
principle
merely
to
say
that
wherever
fraud
can
be
shown
notwithstanding
a
specific
so-called
built-in
statute
of
limitations
within
the
federal
statute,
that
statute
of
limitations,
nevertheless,
may
be
tolled.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
sir,
we
--
we
run
into
one
of
the
difficulties
that
a
practicing
lawyer
has
in
this
case.
such
a
doctrine
might
well
become
relevant,
but
it
could
only
be
ascertained
after
depositions
were
taken
or
after
interrogatories
were
sent.
so
far
as
i
know
now,
i
know
only
the
information
which
was
given
to
me
by
petitioner
and
i
can
only
rely
on
that.
it's
conceivable
that
an
opportunity
to
examine
all
interrogatories
may
well
bring
further
facts
into
light
which
would
strengthen
the
petitioner's
position
and
conceivably
might
even
give
him
another
cause
of
action.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes,
sir.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes,
it
would,
sir.
may
i
accept
and
say
this
that
it
would
be
perhaps
conceivable
that
some
action
in
deceit
could
be
brought
even
if
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
were
held
here
to
be
no
longer
applicable
because
the
statute
of
limitations
could
expire.
i
don't
set
that
forth
with
the
law
and
for
me
to
say
it's
a
conceivable
possibility.
the
petitioner
feels
that
the
cases
of
scarborough
and
toran
should
be
the
cases
which
rule
uniformly
in
this
sort
of
matter.
when
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
passed,
the
original
statute
of
limitations
of
two
years
had
as
its
predominant
purpose
making
uniform
causes
of
action
brought
throughout
the
united
states.
up
to
that
time,
employees
had
their
common
law
rights
and
depending
on
the
various
states
and
the
various
law
in
those
states,
causes
of
action
could
be
brought
in
one,
two,
three
or
more
years.
when
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
passed
granting
these
protections
to
railroad
employees,
the
purpose
of
that
statute
of
limitations
was
to
make
uniform
throughout
the
country,
that
period
of
two
years,
now
three
years
since
1939.
certainly,
permitting
the
exception
of
fraud
or
misrepresentation
to
carve
out
an
estoppel
to
a
statute
of
limitations
in
nowise,
diminishes
the
effect
or
the
strength
of
asserting
a
uniform
statute
of
limitations
because
the
petitioner
still
would
be
put
to
his
proof
as
to
whether
in
fact
there
were
fraud
or
misrepresentation
in
the
case,
nor
is
it
particularly
helpful
to
analyze
these
cases
and
the
situation
in
terms
of
a
substantive
or
remedial
statute
of
limitations,
that
is
a
substantive
statute
of
limitations
cannot
be
tolled
but
a
remedial
statute
of
limitations
can
be
tolled.
generally,
where
those
analyses
are
made
in
various
cases,
fraud
is
not
involved.
furthermore,
a
noble
cause
of
action
is
usually
set
up
to
assert
a
substantive
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
that
in
our
argument,
equally
strong
can
be
made
that
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
inherently
is
not
a
noble
cause
of
action
because
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
still
permits
the
employee
to
sue
his
employer
on
the
basis
of
negligence
and
while
they
there
certainly
are
strong
procedural
safeguards
given
to
the
employee,
it
nevertheless
is
not
as
yet
a
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
i
--
sir
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
very
little,
sir,
and
i
agree
with
that
and
that
was
the
reason
i
made
that
point.
i
nevertheless
did
not
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
skipping.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
i
--
i
certainly
agree
with
that,
sir.
i
think
the
essence
of
this
is
whether
fraud
or
misrepresentation
in
any
way
would
diminish
the
standard
statute
of
limitations,
the
uniform
statute
of
limitations
throughout
the
united
states.
and
since
equity
historically
has
recognized
this
for
a
very
long
time
as
one
of
the
exceptions
to
a
statute
of
limitations,
no
harm
would
be
done
here.
and
the
respondent
certainly
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
benefit
from
his
own
fraud
or
misrepresentation
in
an
action
of
this
type.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
sir,
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
cited
scarborough
and
toran
which
are
within
the
field
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
i've
also
cited
the
holmberg
case
which
i
think
is
--
is
relevant,
although
certainly
not
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
i
think
there
very
well
--
there
very
well
are
particular
cases
but
there
is
no
very
large
body
of
decisions
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
--
that
i'm
aware
of,
and
perhaps
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
case
is
unique
and
i
think
important,
sir.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
but
the
other
circuits
have
gone
otherwise.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
i
think
that
petitioner's
argument
is
further
fortified
by
the
fact
that
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
contains
under
section
56
a
built-in
shield
which
protects
the
petitioner,
and
that
section
reads
as
follows,
and,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
perhaps
to
some
extent,
this
is
an
answer
to
the
very
pertinent
question
which
you
just
put
to.
sorry,
that's
section
55.
"any
contract,
rule,
regulation,
or
device,
whatsoever,
the
purpose
or
intent
of
which
shall
be
to
enable
any
common
carrier
to
exempt
itself
from
any
liability
created
by
this
chapter,
shall
to
that
extent
be
void.".
now,
certainly,
this
section
has
been
held
to
cover
those
situations
where
a
general
release
has
been
taken,
sometimes
in
advance,
other
times,
after
an
accident,
from
a
railroad
employee.
the
purpose
of
that
release
being
to
exempt
the
responsibility
of
the
railroad.
if
congress
intended
that
such
a
thing
not
act
as
a
bar
to
a
suit
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
also
intended,
or
the
language
also
permits,
that
an
oral
misrepresentation
or
fraud
would
similarly
be
covered
by
this.
in
that
respect,
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
is
unique
since
it
does
have
this
protection
which
can
be
set
against
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
it
might
not,
sir,
but
nevertheless,
i
think
we
would
be
permitted
to
--
to
have
a
trial
or
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
--
at
least
some
preliminary
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
--
proceedings
in
this
matter.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
and
that
i
--
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make.
we
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
of
taking
depositions,
securing
interrogatories,
having
a
trial,
and
certainly,
if
there
is
any
overriding
question
of
law
to
be
decided
only
by
the
court,
at
that
time
and
at
that
time
alone,
the
court
would
be
in
the
best
position
to
decide
what
the
proven
facts
had
been
and
what
the
circumstances
had
been.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
well,
in
the
scarborough
case,
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
mere
--
the
mere
misrepresentation
without
more
was
sufficient
to
have
the
question
go
to
the
jury.
and
we
would
certainly
prefer
to
see
that
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
its
decision.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
no,
sir.
it's
not.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes,
sir.
there
were
three
scarborough
cases.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes,
sir.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
i
refer
specifically
to
the
third
appeal
where
that
is
particularly
set
forth.
i
believe
that's
mentioned
--
the
exact
language
is
in
my
brief
on
page
12.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes,
it
seems
that
they
were
edging
and
edging
a
little
further
each
time.
and
certainly,
i'm
happiest
with
the
third
opinion.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
no,
sir.
it
never
did.
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
facts,
sir,
that
the
plaintiff
at
the
very
least
is
entitled
to
his
day
in
court.
and
we
respectfully
petition
this
court
to
permit
the
petitioner
to
have
that
day
in
court.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
very
likely
yes.
i'm
--
mr.
seymour
schwartz
it
was
--
it
was
a
difficult
position.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes,
they
do.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
they
do.
mr.
seymour
schwartz
yes.
i
certainly
think
that
would
be
justified.
