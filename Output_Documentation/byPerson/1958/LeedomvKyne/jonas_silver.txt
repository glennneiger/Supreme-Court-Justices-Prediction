mr.
jonas
silver
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
the
board
makes
a
distinction
here
between
exceeding
the
act
on
one
hand
and
exceeding
the
act
exceedingly
on
the
other.
we
believe
that
when
congress
wrote
section
9
(b)
(1),
there
was
a
mechanism
which
it
devised
to
implement
the
right
of
professional
employees
to
choose
their
own
bargaining
unit.
the
congress
prescribed
only
one
rule,
a
simple
command.
it
said
to
the
board,
"regardless
of
ratios,
regardless
of
whether
there'd
be
only
nine
professional
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit,
that
is
of
no
consequence.
we
do
not
set
this
self-determination
process
up
in
terms
of
whether
you
are
--
you
or
the
professional
employees
are
a
minority
or
a
majority
of
the
proposed
commingling
group.
we
say
that
in
all
cases,
the
board
is
to
conduct
this
kind
of
election.
that
before
the
board
may
declare
a
unit
appropriate
which
combines
professional
and
nonprofessional
employees
it
must
consult
the
professional
employees.
it
is
their
wish
which
is
to
prevail.
now,
not
only
is
the
provision
of
the
act
--
and
i'd
be
one
perfectly
clear
on
that
regard
and
not
susceptible,
therefore
resort
to
the
legislative
history
but
we
think
that
the
whole
treatment
that
congress
gave
the
professional
employees
requires
that
they'd
be
--
be
permitted
to
enjoy
to
the
full
the
right
of
self-determination
of
their
bargaining
unit
and
that
when
the
board
denied
them
this
right,
in
this
case
although
they
were
only
--
although
they
were
only
nine
nonprofessional
employees
involved
it's
exceeded
the
statute.
and
the
reason
is
this.
congress
did
not
posit
the
right
of
the
professional
employee
to
a
--
to
a
unit
of
exclusively
professional
employees
upon
a
game
of
numbers.
in
section
212,
congress
set
up
a
most
carefully
defined
definition
of
what
is
a
professional
employee.
professional
employee
must
be
engaged
in
work
which
is
intellectual
in
nature,
must
be
consistently
so,
it
must
require
discretion
and
judgment,
it
must
be
of
an
output
that
cannot
be
standardized
and
it
must
require
the
application
of
advanced
knowledge
which
is
written
under
the
fashion
to
make
that
malice
tantamount
to
a
--
a
degree
or
in
the
absence
there
of
the
equivalent
experience.
now,
having
given
so
much
attention
and
having
carefully
distinguished
the
peculiar
professional
interests
of
these
types
of
employees,
the
congress
then
said,
"you
are
different
and
we
want
you,
not
the
board,
in
all
cases
to
tell
the
board
whether
you
would
like
to
be
commingled
with
a
qualitatively
inferior
group."
this
is
a
question
of
quality.
it
is
not
a
question
of
quantity.
moreover,
in
other
cases,
where
the
board
has
applied
the
so-called
"predominantly
professional
notion,"
that
where
there
are
a
majority
of
professional
employees,
it
will
not
permit
a
self
determination
of
the
election,
the
number
has
gone
to
quite
a
degree
in
excess
of
the
4%
or
5%
of
the
proposed
bargaining
unit
that
exist
in
this
case.
the
number
indeed
has
gone
as
high
as
31%.
now,
when
professional
employees
bargain,
they
bargain
on
a
different
basis
from
nonprofessional
employees.
the
interest
of
professional
employees
are
different.
their
interest
in
salary
scales
stop
with
the
junior
engineer,
not
with
the
nonprofessional
technical
aide
or
assistant.
their
--
and
their
upgrading
plants
are
entirely
different
from
those
of
the
nonprofessional
employees.
they
have
in
their
agreements
provisions
for
scholarship
funds
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
they
have
provisions
for
leave
of
absence
to
undertake
extensive
schooling.
they
also
had
provisions
protecting
their
interests
in
patents
and
discoveries.
so
we
think
that
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
the
congress
to
have
written
as
it
did
the
statute
in
this
claim
and
readily
applicable
fashion.
all
the
board
has
to
do
then
is
to
be
referred
to
the
interest
of
the
professional
employees.
now,
it
might
result
--
well,
the
board
to
commingle,
professional
or
nonprofessional
employees.
whether
professionals
are
in
a
majority,
it
might
result
that
this
one
voting
route
inclusive
of
--
of
a
handful
of
nonprofessionals
could
change
the
outcome
for
the
election.
for
example,
a
professional
group
which
--
as
a
professional
group
would
have
a
majority
of
professional
employees
and
would
vote
for
the
union
and
wishing
to
represent
the
professional
employees
in
the
exclusive
bargaining
unit.
it's
infiltrated
by
a
number
of
nonprofessional
employees,
and
that
might
be
just
handful,
but
that
number
added
to
--
added
to
the
minority
of
professional
employees
that
is,
the
minority
would
be
the
minority
if
they
were
voting
separately
as
a
professional
group,
would
choke
the
balance
in
favor
of
the
union
that
wish
to
represent
the
employees
in
a
commingle
group.
so
however
you
look
at
it,
the
provision
in
9
(b)
(1)
makes
sense
and
its
literal
applications
make
sense.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
that
maybe
there
is
remedy
under
section
8
(b)
(3),
a
statutory
remedy.
and
that
conceivably,
the
employer
might
file
a
charge
of
unfair
labor
practice
against
the
union
for
not
bargaining
in
the
unit
as
certified.
well,
we
believe
that
the
employer
here
has
certainly
not
agreed
by
the
board's
conclusion.
in
fact,
the
record
of
the
case,
and
the
board
recites
it
in
--
the
decision
indicates
that
the
employer
favored
the
inclusion
of
nonprofessional
employees.
so
the
employer
was
perfectly
content.
this
was
the
bargaining
unit
the
employer
wanted.
it
had
no
reason
to
arrange
or
even
of
its
own
volition
to
contest
in
some
way
this
issue
so
that
it
might
arise
in
the
course
of
statutory
--
of
the
statutory
mode
of
review.
the
employer
was
perfectly
satisfied
to
just
sit
back
and
wait
the
action
of
the
union.
if
the
union
did
not
wish
to
pursue
with
legal
rights,
the
employer
would
then
be
free
to
resume
the
individual
contract
of
hire
that
the
employer
had
before.
it's
quite
different
from
the
situation
where
an
employer
was
agreed
by
a
bargaining
unit
finding,
refuses
to
bargain
and
the
union
as
the
moving
party,
the
party
that
decides
to
upset,
but
in
--
in
a
permissible
fashion
the
status
quo
has
by
virtue
of
that
interest,
the
compulsion
to
go
ahead
and
file
a
charge
in
order
to
realize
the
--
the
value
in
terms
of
the
represented
--
representation
interest
of
the
employees
involved,
but
that
was
not
the
situation
here.
so
we
say
that
the
remedy
under
the
statute
is
completely
speculative,
completely
inadequate.
and
therefore,
we
believe
that
a
remedy
which
is
inadequate
can
hardly
be
termed
compulsory.
so
that
we
come
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
general
power
of
the
courts
to
restrain
board
action
or
agency
action
in
excess
of
authority
has
in
some
fashion,
been
taken
away
by
the
statutory
mode
of
review
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
i
--
wasn't
--
mr.
jonas
silver
that
there
was
some
doubt
in
my
mind
and
i
--
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
lingering
doubt
on
the
court's
mind.
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
it
--
it
has
been
a
--
my
version
of
--
of
the
agreement
is
that
there
is
no
--
it's
conceded
that
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
of
law.
it
is
also
conceded
and
there
--
there
can't
be
any
doubt
about
this
that
the
board
did
not
contest
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
effect
therefore,
is
bound
by
the
district
court's
determination.
now,
the
fact
that
the
board
says
that
maybe
there
was
a
reasonable
approach
that
was
used
in
its
construction
of
--
of
section
9
(b)
(1),
we
say
it
is
completely
irrelevant.
mr.
jonas
silver
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonas
silver
9
(b)
(1),
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonas
silver
well
--
mr.
jonas
silver
no,
sir.
we
are
not.
mr.
jonas
silver
yes
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jonas
silver
i
--
just
one
point,
i
want
to
make
a
claim
that
--
mr.
jonas
silver
agreement.
yes,
i
--
i
want
to
make
some
--
mr.
jonas
silver
just
one
point
that
we
--
mr.
jonas
silver
--
believe
the
government
conceded
on
the
merits
and
that
there's
no
question
on
the
merits
to
the
people
of
the
court.
that
is
as
to
the
interpretation
of
section
9
(b)
(1)
whether
the
board
was
right
or
wrong,
and
the
board
was
wrong,
that's
--
that's
quite
another
matter,
although
related
to
the
question
of
whether
original
jurisdiction
exists.
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
i
--
i
recited,
mr.
justice
black
that
error
compounded
doesn't
absolve
error
unless
this
statute
were
to
have
some
intrinsic
aspects
which
require
the
expertise
of
administrative
agency
to
apply
and
understand,
then
there
--
there
should
be
no
significance
attached
to
the
continued
interpretation
of
what
--
mr.
jonas
silver
--
of
--
of
section
9
(b)
(1).
mr.
jonas
silver
yes.
mr.
jonas
silver
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
black,
that
was
reported
to
the
congress
through
the
joint
committee
by
way
of
testimony
of
the
former
chairman,
mr.
herzog,
and
also
contained
in
certain
annual
reports.
but
the
congress
never
addressed
itself
to
any
revision
of
section
9
(b)
(1)
or
the
professional
definition
of
section
212
and
--
mr.
jonas
silver
we'll
have
to
go
back
to
about
the
--
with
almost
that
at
the
inception
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947,
1948,
and
1949.
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
i
say
--
mr.
jonas
silver
i
--
i
say
that
if
--
if
that
be
so,
then
it
would
appear
that
almost
any
testimony
with
agency
official
before
committee
of
congress
or
any
inclusion
in
an
annual
report
which
remains
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
thereby
in
effect
becomes
a
gloss
on
the
statute,
an
acceptable
almost
amendment
of
the
statute.
mr.
jonas
silver
an
administrative
interpretation
which
has
the
force
of
law
merely
because
the
congress
did
nothing
and
didn't
even
consider
the
problem
as
such.
all
you
have
is
just
to
report
to
congress
in
the
annual
reports
in
a
statement
before
a
congressional
committee.
but
congress
never
evinced
but
it
--
mr.
jonas
silver
yes
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
we
say,
number
one,
that
there's
no
room
for
that
kind
of
administrative
interpretation
whether
it
was
basically
wrong.
there
simply
is
no
latitude
for
the
board
here,
it
must
apply
the
statute
as
written.
and
number
two,
that
the
reports
--
and
therefore,
that
the
board
is
in
error
and
always
has
been
in
error
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
because
it's
--
it's
a
plain
command.
it
doesn't
give
any
alternative.
it
says
that
in
any
case
where
the
board
proposes
to
commingle
professional
and
nonprofessional
employees,
it
shall
be
on
both
hands.
now,
therefore,
though
the
board
may
have
been
infused
with
this
idea
of
predominantly
professional
because
it
has
some
ease
in
--
in
an
administration,
we
don't
have
that
separate
ballots
and
we
don't
have
to
go
through
the
process
of
separating
the
wheat
from
the
chaff,
the
board
was
wrong
in
taking
this
view
from
the
start
because
as
the
chairman
himself
indicated
that
this
was
less
than
100%
good
law
and
then
maybe
its
held
between
50%
and
100%
good
law.
mr.
jonas
silver
yes.
that's
--
that's
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
page
11,
footnote
3,
where
chairman
herzog
replied
to
the
board's
administrative
practice
of
giving
only
partial
effect
to
section
9
(b)
(1)
of
less
than
“100%
good
law".
i
think
it
was
more
than
50%
good
law
and
extremely
good
administrative
practice.
it
seem
to
us,
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
give
professionals
a
chance
to
get
out
of
nonprofessional
units
and
that
would
give
the
few
nonprofessionals
a
chance
to
finding
--
tangle
things
up
for
professionals.
i
think
that
was
the
basic
reason
for
the
decision.
mr.
jonas
silver
that's
correct.
mr.
jonas
silver
but
i
--
i
say
this
that
i
don't
draw
any
conclusion
that
thereby,
the
congress
--
mr.
jonas
silver
and
--
and
the
fact
is
that
congress
never
sought
to,
in
one
way
or
the
other,
alter
or
might
apply
a
treatment.
mr.
jonas
silver
for
whatever
it's
worth,
yes.
i
mean,
in
terms
of
value.
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
i
assume,
justice
brennan,
you
mean
this
predominantly
professional
notion
--
mr.
jonas
silver
yes.
mr.
jonas
silver
we
haven't
attempted
to
tally
all
such
instances
but
we
have
given
a
fair
representation
of
such
instances
at
page
11
of
the
brief
in
footnote
4
and
indicated
that
--
that
the
figure
has
gone
as
high
as
commingling
nonprofessional
employees
to
the
extent
of
31%
of
the
total
number
of
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
the
case
has
listed
in
the
percentage
of
commingling
of
nonprofessional
employees
without
the
vote
of
9
(b)
(1).
mr.
jonas
silver
yes.
i
was
--
and
this
list
of
the
instances
of
cases
is
not
by
any
means
--
mr.
jonas
silver
exhausted.
mr.
jonas
silver
we
--
we
didn't
attempt
to
present
an
exhaust
--
mr.
jonas
silver
they're
--
they're
considerable
other
--
considerable
number
of
--
mr.
jonas
silver
yes.
but
again,
it
--
it
was
not
meant
to
be
an
exhaustive
treatment
--
mr.
jonas
silver
--
and
simply
an
--
an
illustrative.
now,
the
question
on
--
with
regard
to
jurisdiction
is,
there
is
a
general
power
in
the
courts
to
restrain
actions
of
agencies
in
excess
of
statutory
authority
that
basic
power
has
existed
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
that
goes
back
almost
to
the
founding
of
the
constitutional
system
of
government.
and
it
has
been
enunciated
most
recently
in
the
cases
of
the
court
of
the
harmon
case
and
the
--
perhaps
distinguishing
but
related
panama
canal
case.
now,
the
propositions
there
are,
that
if
the
question
involves
discretion
on
expertise
and
it
requires
that
the
agency
make
constructions
from
loose
and
general
language,
then
the
agency
will
be
permitted
to
exercise
its
authority
to
the
hilt
in
that
regard.
this
was
a
function
congress
entrusted
to
the
agency.
but
if
the
duty
involved
is
simply
one
of
carrying
out
a
plain
statutory
command,
and
if
the
agency
exceeds
the
limits
of
its
authority
in
carrying
out
that
command
or
it
fails
to
carry
out
that
command
then
a
party
injured
by
that
failure
deprived
of
the
statutory
right
in
this
case
may
obtain
relief
from
the
court
in
the
form
of
a
mandatory
injunction.
mr.
jonas
silver
say
for
--
i
think
the
--
the
law
there
would
be
as
i
understand,
let's
say
for
constitutional
issues
--
mr.
jonas
silver
congress
would
have
that
authority.
mr.
jonas
silver
they
could
have
specifically
provided
here.
mr.
jonas
silver
yes.
and
our
view
is
that
in
this
type
of
problem,
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
do
that.
this
type
of
problem
meaning,
that
the
board
has
simply
to
follow
out
the
mandate
of
the
statute.
when
it
refuses
to
conduct
an
election
as
it
did
in
this
case,
it
has
thereby
conducted
itself
outside
the
scope
of
law.
it
has
denied
to
the
professional
employees
their
right
under
the
statute
to
themselves
determine
whether
they
wish
to
be
commingled.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
power
in
the
court
to
compel
the
board
to
adhere
to
the
statutory
command.
now,
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
here
is
concerned
entirely
with
the
area
of
expertise
and
discretion
and
the
competence
of
administrative
body
to
handle
at
least
in
the
--
in
--
in
the
stages
of
the
representation
determination,
the
types
of
problems
that
arise
in
that
context.
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
i
could
--
let
me
--
let
me
answer
you
with
--
in
this
fashion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
is
said
that
every
active
administrates
--
administrative
agency
is
an
act
of
construction.
however,
we
--
mr.
jonas
silver
well,
we
believe
that
there
was
--
if
there
was
ever
no
act
of
construction
possible
when
the
board
had
only
to
translate
the
mandate
of
congress
into
action,
it's
here
in
section
9
(b)
(1).
mr.
jonas
silver
our
argument
is
restricted
to
that
type
of
case.
mr.
jonas
silver
unless
there'd
be
some
device
that
i'm
not
aware
of
at
this
point
and
that's
almost
inevitable.
mr.
jonas
silver
now,
there
was
one
underlying
intent
that
congress
had.
it
spoke
in
1935,
in
1937,
in
1947
of
one
purpose.
it
referred
to
the
denial
of
amendments
of
the
rejected
amendments
which
would
have
permitted
direct
judicial
review
in
each
of
these
stages
of
enactment
of
the
wagner
act
and
going
on
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
it
referred
to
its
desire
to
avoid
dilatory
tactics
which
would
frustrate
collective
bargaining.
now,
we
think
that
in
this
type
of
problem
where
the
board
has
only
to
translate
the
command
of
congress
which
was
in
unalterably
in
one
way
that
there
can't
be
any
question
about
frustrating
collective
bargaining
through
the
kind
of
jurisdiction,
and
the
order
granted
by
the
district
court
in
this
proceeding
because
there
could
be
only
one
way
of
carrying
out
the
will
of
congress,
namely,
for
the
board
to
translate
into
action
what
section
9
(b)
(1)
requires
the
board
to
do.
here,
the
--
the
congress
did
not
leave
it
up
to
the
board
to
choose
as
to
which
would
be
an
appropriate
unit.
it
let
the
board
go
to
a
certain
point,
proposed
a
commingling
and
then
said,
"you,
the
professional
employees
make
the
final
decisions."
so
we
don't
think
that
it
can
be
said
that
though
we
maybe
in
effect
causing
delay
that
our
delay
in
the
administrative
process
is
a
dilatory
type
of
delay.
rather,
our
delay
is
a
necessary
kind
of
delay
to
bring
the
board
which
has
erred
here
into
conformity
with
the
statute.
now,
the
amendment
proposed
in
1947,
the
house
bill
would
have
permitted
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
certification
on
the
basis
of
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
there
again,
we
believe,
congress
was
considering
the
proposition
of
whether
the
board
or
the
courts
should
go
into
findings
within
the
administrative
discretion
of
the
board
namely
to
determine
whether
the
finding
had
any
basis
in
evidence
in
its
natural
basis
in
evidence.
this
was
not
the
type
of
review
that
the
court
exercised
in
this
proceeding
in
carrying
out
its
equity
powers.
here,
the
only
consideration
involved
is,
has
the
board
gone
beyond
statutory
powers
not
is
there
substantial
evidence
in
support
for
the
board's
finding
which
it
has
made
within
the
scope
of
its
powers.
now,
switchmen's
case,
we
believe,
is
distinguishable
from
the
present
proceeding.
in
that
--
in
switchmen's,
the
mediation
board
have
the
authority
to
determine
what
is
a
craft
or
class.
this
was
a
power
given
to
the
mediation
board.
the
fact
that
it
reached
a
decision
that
the
system-wide
unit
was
the
appropriate
unit
rather
than
the
division-wide
unit
by
not
weighing
the
alternative
of
a
division-wide
unit
but
rapidly
getting
through
a
conclusion
of
law
that
only
one
type
of
unit
was
permissible,
namely,
a
--
a
railroad-wide
or
system-wide
unit
was
a
power
which
the
mediation
board
had
to
exercise.
it
fell
within
the
definition
of
craft
or
class.
it
was
a
type
of
problem
that
the
congress
meant
the
mediation
board
to
be
exclusively
concerned
with
and
did
not
intend
to
implicate
judiciary.
now
here,
the
board
has
only
one
conclusion
to
reach,
one
perhaps
to
follow.
it
didn't
matter
in
switchmen's
that's
--
that
the
mediation
board
reached
the
conclusion
it
did
in
--
in
a
way
which
did
not
take
into
consideration
an
alternative
appropriate
unit
but
was
based
entirely
on
the
statutory
construction.
that
was
the
power
that
the
mediation
board
had.
here,
there
is
no
question
of
statutory
construction.
there
was
only
one
direction
which
the
board,
we
believe,
must
take
and
which
the
equity
court
properly
ordered
it
to
take.
the
alternative
that
we
feel,
would
be
to,
in
effect,
sanction
at
least
a
partial
repeal
of
statutory
proviso,
a
limitary
power,
a
--
a
power
of
limitation
on
the
board's
authority
by
administrative
by
at.
so
that,
in
essence
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
principle
of
supremacy
of
law
demands
that
the
board
be
brought
back
to
the
command
which
congress
laid
down
in
the
act
and
only
that
way
will
the
representation
rights
of
the
professional
employees
to
be
in
a
separate
bargaining
unit
if
they
so
desire
be
realized.
