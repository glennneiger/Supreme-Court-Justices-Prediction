suppose
the
union
was
permitted
that
unfair
labor
of
practice
use
to
bargain
and
then
the
employees
could
go
right
ahead
and
bargain
with
the
members
individually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
even
if
he
tried
--
he
could
still
bargain
to
them
individually
that
the
union
is
trying
to
address
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
he
refuse
--
if
the
union
refuses
to
bargain,
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
not.
you
may
if
you're
right
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
curious.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
thought
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
going
to
argue
that
that's
not
this
case?
i'd
like
to
hear
you.
i
have
some
question
about
it
in
my
own
mind
but
the
statute
seems
to
be
pretty
plain.
i'd
like
to
know
why
you
think
there
is
justification
while
interpreting
the
statute
in
that
way.
that's
for
myself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
the
argument
that
the
board
has
been
construing
the
statute
in
this
way
for
a
number
of
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
argue
--
what
they
argue
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
argue
is
that
was
decided
sometime
ago
in
the
continental
motors
decision
that
the
statute
did
not
bar
them
from
allowing
a
small
percentage
of
nonprofessionals
to
go
in
and
that
that
was
reported
to
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
bringing
how
long
--
how
long
was
that
--
has
it
been
since
the
board
first
decided
that
and
reported
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
do
say
to
the
argument
they
make
that
having
reported
it
to
congress
that
the
--
to
a
certain
extent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
it'll
be
construed
as
a
being
a
reasonable
interpretation
or
they
would
have
changed
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
administrative
interpretation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
more
than
that,
do
you
not,
as
i
understand
you
--
what
you
say.
you
have
a
law,
seven
or
eight
years
or
more,
10
years
practically
as
i
understand
you
of
continued
administrative
interpretation
that
this
statute
doesn't
mean
what
it
would
seem
to
mean
plainly
on
its
face.
if
you
just
can't
do
that
at
all
but
that
you
can
use
judgment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
administration
and
letting
a
few
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
indicated
how
and
where.have
you
referred
to
that
in
your
brief?
