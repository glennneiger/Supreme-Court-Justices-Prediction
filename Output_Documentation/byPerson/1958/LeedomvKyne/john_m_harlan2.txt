justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
one
of
those
cases
where
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
first
before
you
get
to
the
statutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
surely,
that
would
be
a
different
thing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
justice
brennan
and
i
we're
talking
about
the
merits
and
justice
frankfurter
is
talking
about
the
procedure.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
you're
arguing
this
on
the
premise
i
take
it,
that
the
board,
doing
what
it
did,
did
not
comply
with
the
statutes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
are
arguing
on
that
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
the
government
to
concede
that
there
was
in
the
practical
matter
no
review
that
this
jurisdiction
was
not
permissible.
i
understood
the
government
to
concede
your
point
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
--
court
of
appeals
on
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
repeated
it
because
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
understood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
any
question
in
your
mind
that
congress
was
chosen
to
do
so
but
it
expressly
cut
off
any
judicial
review?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
no
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(voice
overlap)
or
reservation
but
could
they
have
specifically
provided
here
that
there
would
be
no
judicial
review.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
only
question
is
one
with
how
or
whether
they
intended
to
that
or
whether
they
didn't.
