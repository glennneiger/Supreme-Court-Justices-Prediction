boyd
s.leedom,
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
william
kyne,
et
al.
mr.
come.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
motion
is
granted.
mr.
come.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
come,
can
i
ask
you
this
question
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
justice
brennan
were
to
you
ask
you
again
the
precise
question
that
he
asked
you
at
the
outset.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
your
answer
be
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
seem
to
understand
it
then,
it
was
rather
specific
i
thought
and
rather
short.
and
i
just
like
to
know
if
you
would
answer
the
same
or
if
you're
going
to
--
because
if
you
do
answer
it
the
same,
we've
got
one
thing
to
look
at.
if
you're
going
to
answer
it
differently,
you're
going
to
get
away
from
your
answer,
then
we
have
to
look
at
the
whole
situation
differently.
now,
which
is
it?
do
you
or
don't
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wanted
to
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
silver.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
would
you
--
would
you
state
your
point
again
to
see
if
we
all
--
all
understand
what
has
been
agreed
to
and
what
hasn't,
i'm
not
so
sure.
i
would
say
it
hasn't
been
but
i'd
just
like
to
have
you
state
it
again.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
are
we
agreed
on
that.
is
--
is
that
your
position,
counsel?
if
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
i
suggest
that
you
go
ahead
and
make
your
point,
counsel.
[laughs]
i
believe
it's
too
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
suggest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
suggest,
mr.
silver
that
you
argue
your
case,
there
--
there
apparently,
there
obviously
is
an
agreement
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
find
everybody
are
understanding,
so
proceed
and
argue
your
case
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
