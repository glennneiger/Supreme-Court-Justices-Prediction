justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
come,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
you'd
have
no
case
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
face
of
the
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
we're
reading
nothing
but
the
words
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
have
to
go
into
something
else
to
read
the
meaning
into
it
that
you've
given
to
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
addressing
myself
for
these
facts,
you
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
are
your
words
and
i
gather
that
you
can't
be
reviewed
in
respect
to
that
determination.
this
can't
be
reviewed
this
way,
i
gather
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
are
you.
suppose
--
suppose
this
went
into
a
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
of
the
issue.
we're
raising
that?
can't
your
interpretation
of
statute
be
reviewed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
would
require
the
employer
claiming
with
you
and
refusing
to
require
you
to
exercise
--
or
rather
refusing
to
deal
with
matters
relating
to
the
nine
when
you're
supposed
to
represent
them
in
some
ways
creating
the
employer
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
are
--
are
you
saying
to
us,
mr.
come,
that
perhaps
the
practical
matter
of
your
interpretation
of
the
statutes
cannot
have
judicial
review
even
if
it
--
even
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i'm
thinking
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
other
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is,
we
can
review
it
here.
we
can't
just
probably
haven't
got
the
opportunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
more
fact,
mr.
silver,
if
this
appears
anywhere.
how
many
instances
that
the
board
commingled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
they
intermingled
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
they
have
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
the
prior
periods
from
volume
80
to
volume
107.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
