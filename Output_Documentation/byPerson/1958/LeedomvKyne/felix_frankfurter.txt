justice
felix
frankfurter
when
do
you
say
your
ordinary
case
--
this
--
couldn't
be
tried.
certainly,
you
--
i'm
considering
the
problem.
i
usually
have
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
(inaudible)
does
the
statute
been
amended
since
this
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
right
or
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wonder
why
it's
so
clear
that
one
says
that
i'm
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
joined
in
that
opinion.
i
never
could
understand
why
you
have
failed
to
go
to
the
merits
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
has
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
--
but
you're
not
thereby
implying
this
is
a
ruthless
or
--
or
a
malevolent
or
what's
usually
called
as
wholly
indispensably
arbitrary
action
on
the
part
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
denied
certainly
obvious
rights
just
before
this
that
will
--
what
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
that
if
the
question
came
up
on
the
merits,
the
board
now
tells
us
it
would
not
urge
officials
and
allow
them
--
and
allow
them
judgment
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
want
to
get
back
to
it
but
therefore,
the
confessions
are
on
the
basis
if
this
is
on
the
merits,
you'll
have
no
case,
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
thing
is
--
is
tried
out,
and
mind
you
that
what
i
--
what
--
and
what
i
feel
like
i
don't
understand
how
we
first
come
to
the
merits
and
help
decide
whether
he
can
bring
up
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
that
merely
makes
you
stand
on
my
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
8
(a)
statue
but
this
is
the
particular
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
you
had
flagrant
case,
if
you
had
a
case
about
which
the
commission
couldn't
--
the
board
couldn't
say
that
this
was
an
allowable
judgment
with
reference
to
the
industrial
subject
matter,
then
you
would
have
a
great
difficulty,
i
think
to
say
--
in
saying
it's
wrong
but
it's
not
moot,
although
what
is
called
arbitrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
which
is
a
different
problem
in
that
is
not
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short
--
in
short,
the
board
does
not
come
here
admitting
a
statutorily
erroneous
interpretation.
that
challenging
the
act's
question
of
reviewability
of
a
--
of
the
certification
here,
questions
--
reviewing
certification
jurisdiction.
but
it
comes
here
with
the
officers'contention,
namely
that
it
gave
an
interpretation
on
which
it
administratively
said
that
apart
from
that
question,
it's
says
as
a
matter
of
statutory
constructions
has
no
power
to
the
district
court
to
review
certification,
isn't
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
you
make
no
distinction
between
erroneous
and
non-erroneous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
do
not
reserve
a
case
in
which
we
say,
"the
record
in
this
case
admits
an
erroneous
construction,
nevertheless."
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
--
suppose
one
starts
with
the
general
attitude
that
judicial
review
as
the
rules
in
denial
of
the
exception.
suppose
one
step
with
that
emphasis.
where
was
--
where
would
one
end
up
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
if
i
understand
it,
as
i
understand
mr.
come,
he
agreed
that
on
this
record
as
a
practical
thing,
there
is
no
mode
of
reviewing
this
to
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
therefore,
for
practical
purposes
on
this
--
in
this
situation,
although
they
did
not
concede
that
there
was
an
error
--
that
they
had
violated
the
statute,
9
(b)
(1),
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
concede
that.
they
agreed
as
the
practicality,
justice
harlan
said,
"you
couldn't
raise
this
if
you
can't
raise
it
by
a
direct
review."
that's
the
government's
position,
is
that
right?
and
you
don't
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
not
thinking
of
constitutional
question,
are
you,
mr.
silver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
merely
a
question
of
construing
the
statute
whether
there's
--
of
review
this
particular
certification
including
the
nonprofessional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i
--
i
understand
your
first
point.
that
is,
there
is
no
amount
of
administrative
practice
can
amend
the
statute,
that's
your
point.
but
i
would
like
to
know
and
i'm
not
yet
clear
of
your
answer
to
justice
black
whether
you
agree,
as
i
assume
you
do,
that
in
fact,
the
board
gave
that
construction
very
early.
in
fact,
it
was
reported
to
the
congress.
in
fact,
the
congress
did
nothing
about
it
and
the
board
continued
to
--
to
enter
what
you
would
recall
reflective
interpretation.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
i'm
not
talking
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
facts
are.
as
i
summarizes
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board
has
been
continuous.
it
was
clear
about
--
that
this
is
candid
and
this
has
been
instructed.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
making
any
concessional
law,
i
quite
agree.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
justice
brennan's
question
was
not
the
percentage
of
the
professional
and
nonprofessional
but
the
number
of
instances
in
which
they
commingled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
exhausted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
would
you
agree
or
disagree
that
as
this
case
illustrates
that
almost
any
question
can
give
rise
to
the
controversy
where
there
is
expertise
or
whether
it
is
obligatory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that's
quite
to
say
that
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
argument
is
restricted
to
those
cases
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
in
each
case,
the
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
it
is
one
of
those
things
before
a
grant
for
the
union.
isn't
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
