mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court
in
affirming
the
district
court
which
had
set
aside
a
representation
determination
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
has
jurisdiction
under
its
general
equity
powers
and
a
part
from
the
review
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
review
a
certification
of
bargaining
representatives
issued
by
the
board
under
section
9
of
the
act
at
the
suit
of
a
labor
organization
contesting
the
board's
action
on
the
ground
that
the
board
has
failed
to
comply
with
statutory
requirements
in
issuing
the
certification.
the
underlying
facts
are
briefly
these.
respondent,
the
president
of
a
labor
organization,
called
the
westinghouse
engineers
association
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
under
section
9
of
the
act
seeking
a
representation
election
for
a
group
of
about
233
engineers
employed
to
the
plant
of
the
westinghouse
electric
corporation.
these
engineers
were
all
professional
employees
within
the
meaning
of
section
212
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
another
labor
organization
intervened
in
the
proceeding
and
sought
to
add
certain
additional
groups
of
employees
to
the
bargaining
unit
contending
that
they
too
were
professional
employees.
the
board
found
that
these
additional
employees
were
sought
to
be
added,
were
not
professional
employees
within
the
meaning
of
section
212
of
the
act.
but
that
denying
of
the
employees,
shared
a
close
community
of
interest
with
the
233
professional
employees.
and
if
they
worked
in
the
same
general
area
and
under
the
same
general
supervision
--
and
the
board
further
found
that
the
inclusion
of
these
nine
with
the
233
professionals
would
not
destroy
the
predominantly
professional
character
of
the
unit.
so
the
board
directed
an
election
in
a
unit
consisting
of
the
233
professional
engineers
and
the
nine
closely
related
nonprofessionals.
the
engineers
association
protested
this
action
contending
that
it
violated
section
9
(b)
(1)
of
the
act.
section
9
(b)
(1)
provides
that
the
board
shall
not
decide
that
a
unit
is
appropriate
for
bargaining
purposes
if
such
unit
includes
both
professional
employees
and
employees
who
are
nonprofessionals
unless
a
majority
of
the
professionals
vote
for
inclusion
in
such
unit.
now,
from
the
time
this
provision
was
first
enacted
and
it
came
into
the
act
in
1947
with
the
taft-hartley,
the
board
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
only
in
a
situation
where
it
was
sought
to
take
the
professionals
as
a
minority
group
and
include
them
into
a
larger
nonprofessional
unit
or
--
or
a
separate
vote
on
their
part
would
be
necessary
to
give
them
an
effective
voice
in
selecting
a
representative.
and
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
for
the
situation
that
was
presented
here
or
the
professional
employees
or
the
predominant
element
in
the
unit
and
a
small
number
of
closely
related
nonprofessionals
sharing
a
close
community
of
interest
were
sought
to
be
included.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor
but
it
is
one
of
those
cases
where
if
you
don't
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you
--
you
sometimes
lose
sight
of
the
purpose
of
the
provision.
it
was
a
proviso
to
the
board's
otherwise
broad
discretion
in
defining
units,
and
the
board
tells
that
it
was
justified
in
looking
to
the
--
to
the
purpose
since
it
--
since
it
wasn't
the
nature
of
a
proviso.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
on
the
--
on
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
on
the
--
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
we
have
no
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we're
talking
merely
about
the
question
of
--
on
the
merits
as
a
part
from
the
jurisdiction
question
which
we
are
hereon
and
on
that,
we
believe
we
have
a
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
you
were
addressing
yourself
to
the
interpretation
of
9
(b)
(1).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
it
has
not
been
amended
in
that
respect.
the
question
that
the
justice
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
we're
talking
about
a
different
part
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we're
--
we're
talking
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
well,
so
the
board
accordingly
rejected
the
contention
of
the
engineers
association
and
they
then
transferred
their
struggle
for
a
pure
unit
to
the
district
court.
they
--
well,
i
should
say
first
of
all
that
the
election
was
held
in
the
mixed
unit
and
the
engineers
were
certified.
they
--
they
won
a
majority
in
the
votes
of
these
nonprofessionals
who
were
not
decisive
of
the
outcome
of
the
election
because
they
won
by
more
than
the
nine
votes.
so
that,
they
were
certified
and
they
then
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
invoking
the
district
court's
general
equity
powers
in
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
the
purpose
of
getting
review
and
setting
aside
of
the
certification.
the
board
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
from
the
ground
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
the
district
court
found
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
further
found
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
9
(b)
(1)
was
erroneous,
and
it
then
proceeded
to
set
aside
the
certification
and
to
restrain
the
board
from
holding
a
new
election
in
a
mixed
unit
without
first
giving
the
professionals
an
opportunity
to
vote
separately
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
nonprofessionals
should
be
included.
on
appeal,
the
court
below
affirmed
the
district
court.
the
court
below
found
that
the
union
here
was
not
in
a
position
to
obtain
an
adequate
review
of
the
certification
under
the
statutory
review
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
in
such
a
situation
the
court
said,
the
question
as
to
whether
review
was
available
in
a
district
court
turned
on
whether
the
representation
determination
was
in
the
area
of
the
board's
discretion
or
whether
it
involved
board
application
of
statutory
requirements.
and
since
this
case
was
in
the
latter
category
and
since
the
board
has
departed
from
statutory
requirements,
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
--
in
the
district
court
review
and
--
and
grant
relief.
now,
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
board
representation
determinations
are
reviewable
by
independent
equity
suit
in
the
federal
district
court,
was
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
before
this
court
twice
before.
it
was
before
the
court
in
afl
against
nlrb
in
1940
which
did
not
involve
an
independent
equity
suit
but
it
involved
an
attempt
to
obtain
review
of
a
certification
under
section
10
(e)
and
after
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
this
court
held
that
a
certification
was
not
a
final
order
for
purposes
of
the
statutory
review
provision
and
left
open
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
could
be
reviewed
by
independent
equity
suit
in
the
district
court.
in
1945
in
the
inland
empire
case,
the
district
court
suit
was
before
this
court.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
question
because
it
took
the
position
that
it
would
reach
that
only
if
there
were
a
showing
that
the
board
had
exceeded
statutory
requirements
and
the
court
first
found
that
on
the
situation
presented
in
inland
empire,
there
was
no
substance
of
the
contention
that
the
board
has
departed
from
statutory
requirements.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
your
honor
is
in
company
with
a
lot
of
other
people
who
have
commented
on
the
inland
empire
case
subsequently.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
we're
here
with
the
situation
that
has
twice
been
reserved.
and
insofar
as
material,
we
think
that
there
have
been
no
changes
made
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
the
taft-hartley
amendments
to
change
the
situation
of
what
it
was
under
the
--
under
the
wagner
act.
indeed,
as
i
will
point
out
in
a
moment,
we
think
that
our
position
that
congress
has
deliberately
precluded,
district
court
review
has
been
affirmed
and
strengthened
by
the
taft-hartley
amendments.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
scheme
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
are
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
we
are
not
challenging
the
finding
of
the
court
below
that
our
interpretation
of
9
(b)
(1)
is
erroneous.
we
believed
that
there
is
rational
support
work
but
we're
up
here
not
challenging
that
finding.
now,
section
10
(e)
in
apt
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor
we
are
not,
and
with
the
last
part
of
our
brief,
is
--
is
directed
to
a
showing
in
--
in
that
direction.
if
there
was
error,
it
was
honest
error.
we
think
that
there
was
--
there
was
room
for
a
difference
of
opinion.
this
provision
isn't
as
clear.
and
it
doesn't
leave
as
much
room
as
many
of
the
others
do
but
we
do
think
that
there
was
room
for
an
honest
difference
of
interpretation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
can
be
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
the
difficulty
is,
that
the
union
is
usually
in
a
position
where
it
cannot
raise
it
through
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
now,
this
union
could
conceivably
raise
it
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
but
the
court
below
thought
that,
that
possibility
was
so
remote
that
it
could
not
be
regarded
as
--
as
an
adequate
avenue
of
review.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
could
actually
in
this
case
create
a
union
unfair
labor
practice.
as
we
point
out
in
--
in
our
brief
here,
section
8
(b)
(3)
of
the
act
requires
a
union
to
bargain
just
as
section
8
(a)
(5)
requires
an
employer
to
bargain.
now,
the
union
here
conceivably
could
refuse
to
bargain
in
the
unit
certified
by
the
board
which
includes
these
nine
nonprofessionals.
that
would
open
the
union
--
open
--
open
it
to
an
8
(b)
(3)
charge
which
would
either
have
to
be
filed
by
the
employer
or
by
the
nine
nonprofessionals.
you
get
an
unfair
labor
of
practice
order
against
the
union
and
then
they're
up
into
the
court
of
appeals.
as
i
say,
the
court
below
found
that
that
was
too
remote
to
provide
an
adequate
remedy.
and
in
the
usual
situation
in
which
this
comes
up
where
you
have
the
union
that
does
not
get
certified,
complain
about
the
board
action
in
the
representation
case,
it's
very
difficult
for
that
union
to
get
into
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
--
i
am
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
that
is
a
matter
of
deliberate
choice
on
the
part
of
congress
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
the
facts
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
unless
this
route
that
i
explained
through
the
unfair
labor
of
practice
procedure
is
an
alternative
and
it
is
not
an
alternative
in
the
--
in
the
usual
case.
it
happens
to
be
here
because
this
union
was
--
was
recertified.
usually,
the
union
that's
complaining
is
the
one
that
was
denied
the
certification
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
true
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
court
below
felt
that
the
employer
probably
would
not
be
under
much
incentive
to
file
an
unfair
labor
of
practice
charge
against
the
union.
however,
you
do
have
the
nine
non
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
that
raises
an
interesting
question
where
--
where
the
union
has
--
has
been
certified
as
the
bargaining
agent,
i
--
i
doubt
whether
the
employer
would
--
would
be
free
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
might
if
the
--
if
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
--
it
might
very
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
too
clear
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
and
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
wish
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
convey
that
motion.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
was
very
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
was
answering
justice
brennan's
specific
question
that
if
you
look
merely
at
the
literal
language
of
--
of
9
(b)
(1),
it
would
not
support
the
board's
interpretation.
however,
we
all
know
that
interpreting
a
statute,
you're
not
--
sometimes
you
really
misconstrue
it
if
you
stop
only
at
the
--
at
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
yes
your
honor.
so
that
--
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
including
the
purpose
as
why
in
the
picture,
we
do
have
a
case
on
the
--
on
the
interpretation
and
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you'd
--
you'd
get
the
kind
of
a
basic
unfairness
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
neither
your
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
well,
i
thought
that
i
had
indicated
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
indicates
as
we
read
it
and
we
have
set
it
forth
in
our
brief.
that
it
was
put
in
to
strike
at
a
very
specific
practice
of
the
board
under
the
wagner
act.
and
that
specific
practice
which
was
mentioned
was
putting
a
small
hope
of
professional
employees
into
a
big
clerical
or
salaried
employees
unit.
and
that
had
the
effect
of
submerging
the
professionals
so
that
in
an
election,
whatever
their
wishes,
they
were
overwritten
by
the
clerical
and
--
and
salaried
employees.
now,
--
and
the
--
and
committee
reports
in
explaining
why
9
(b)
(1)
was
put
in
said
that
it
was
put
in
to
strike
at
this
practice.
now,
there's
nothing
in
there
to
indicate
that
they
wanted
to
cover
what
the
board
regards
as
the
different
situation
that
you
have
here
where
the
professionals
are
the
predominant
element
in
the
unit.
that's
only
a
case
of
putting
in
a
few
nonprofessionals
who
are
most
closely
related
to
the
professionals
although
they're
not
technically
professional
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
as
i
understand
his
--
his
question,
it
was
--
what
we
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
answer
it
this
way,
i
think
it's
the
same
way.
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
say
that
based
on
the
literal
language
of
9
(b)
(1),
i
don't
think
that
we
have
a
case.
however,
the
interpretation
of
9
(b)
(1)
must
take
into
account
not
only
the
literal
language
but
the
purpose
of
the
provision.
and
if
you
take
that
into
account,
then
we
do
have
a
case
on
the
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
is
not.
the
board
interpreted
it
this
way.
about
the
first
week
or
so
after
the
provision
was
--
was
enacted
in
the
--
these
cases
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
continental
motors
case,
early
in
--
in
1947
after
the
amendments
were
enacted.
shortly
thereafter,
chairman
herzog
of
the
board
was
referring
before
the
joint
committee
which
was
the
watchdog
set
up
here
to
supervise
the
administration
of
the
act.
and
one
of
the
things
that
--
among
others
that
was
discussed
with
the
joint
committee
was
this
continental
motors
case
in
which
chairman
herzog
had
explained
what
they
had
done.
the
joint
committee
could
not
indicate
any
critical
reaction
to
that
and
consistently,
since
continental
motors,
since
1947,
the
board
has
interpreted
9
(b)
(1)
this
way.
and
this
is
the
--
the
first
court
challenge
of
those
interpretation.
and
all
those
cases
are
collected
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it's
correct
with
--
with
this
qualification.
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
did
not
in
our
--
either
in
the
court
of
appeals,
or
in
our
statement
of
questions
presented
to
this
court
in
applying
for
the
writ,
contest
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
we
had
aired
in
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
construing
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
--
to
close
on
is
that
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
itself
provides
for
a
review
of
certification
in
only
one
situation.
and
that
becomes
the
basis
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
order
and
that
is
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
indicates
that
congress
did
so
deliberately
because
it
was
afraid
that
permitting
a
board
of
review
of
representation
and
determinations
would
leave
the
door
open
for
dilatory
tactics
in
representation
cases.
it
was
quite
a
history
of
that
under
public
revolution
in
1944
which
set
out
the
predecessor
board
and
congress
wanted
to
avoid
that
in
the
wagner
act.
if
we
considered
the
question
twice
since
then,
primarily
because
the
union
said
9
(d)
doesn't
give
us
an
adequate
opportunity
to
get
any
review
here.
in
1939,
the
afl
sought
to
get
congress
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
review
for
that
reason.
it
was
rejected
for
this
reason.
and
in
taft-hartley,
the
house
had
a
provision
in
that
would
have
permitted
direct
review
of
certifications
for
the
reason
that
9
(d)
wasn't
fair
to
labor
organizations
who
award
him
a
position
as
utilized
in
9
(d)
procedure.
and
9
(d)
wasn't
even
fair
to
the
employer
or
had
it
technically
violate
the
act
in
order
to
get
review.
the
senate
bill
kept
9
(d)
as
it
was
and
in
conference,
that
was
--
the
house
provision
was
rejected
and
senator
taft
says
the
reason
the
house
exceeded
was
that
they
were
--
they
abridge
that
putting
--
permitting
any
board
of
review
or
representation
determinations
would
provide
for
salutatory
tactics
in
representation
cases.
so
that
we
say
we
have
here
a
situation
where
congress
knew
full
well
that
there
would
be
situations
where
you
couldn't
--
and
a
union
might
not
be
able
to
get
a
review
of
board
action
in
a
representation
case.
but
balancing
the
harm
of
those
cases
against
the
greater
nature
of
really
following
up
the
collective
bargaining
process
by
permitting
unions
to
run
into
the
district
courts
and
get
review
of
representation
determination.
congress
concluded
that
on
balance,
it
was
not
going
to
go
any
further
than
9
(d).
and
we
say
that
congress
--
this
is
an
area
where
congress
is
entitled
to
stop
with
the
administrative
determination
just
as
this
court
found
in
the
switchmen's
case
involving
the
national
mediation
board,
it
could
likewise
do.
it
held
there
that
the
scheme
of
that
act
was
such
as
to
indicate
an
intention
to
stop
with
the
administrative
determination,
even
where
questions
of
law
were
involved.
and
we
think
that
we
are
like
switchmen's,
and
even
a
fortiori
because
of
the
specific
history
here
that
shows
that
congress
did
this
deliberately.
that
scheme
had
to
be
implied
in
switchmen's,
and
here,
we
have
direct
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
go
no
further.
and
i
might
say
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
one
would
end
up
still
with
the
board's
position
because
even
starting
with
that
position,
it
is
also
cruel
that
congress
at
least
in
these
areas
of
administrator
of
--
administrator
of
--
of
the
new
rights
that
are
--
that
are
--
that
it
creates
in
a
statute
such
as
this,
could
shut
off
judicial
review.
and
the
only
question
is
whether
it
has
clearly
manifested
its
intent.
and
we
submit
that
if
this
isn't
the
clear
manifestation,
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
clearer
one.
