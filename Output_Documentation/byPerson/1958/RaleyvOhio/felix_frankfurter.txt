justice

justice

may
i
ask
some
more?
if
they
had
the

i
thought
i
understood
you
had
provisions
for
immunized
testimony
to
make
it,
is
that
right?
justice

and
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
--
they
weren't

because
they
give
you
immunity.

but

justice

it
was

a

wasn't
it
the

justice

and
there
is
difference
in

between
a

justice

and
at
all

at
all

somebody
before,
i
take
it,
in
ohio
elsewhere,
before
an
immunity
statute
can
operate
somebody
in
authority
on
the

i
ask
you
to

i
now
offer
you
by

by

of

you
will
have
immunity.
that

justice

so
that's
--
so
that
testimony
was
not
compelled
in

for
an
immunity.
justice

this

your

your

is

is
put

the

enforced
his

is
also

which
is

to
him
by

it
not?

is
given,
either
by

the

carries
through

ground

to

is
that
right?
justice

is
that
your
position?
justice

implies

you

it

and
he
was
told
that

could
rest

he?
justice

and
thus,
the

told
him
that
they
wouldn't

justice

you
mean
nowhere
did
the
chairman
say
that,
“we're
not
going
to
ask
people
to
incriminate
themselves?”
justice
felix

well,
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
justice
felix

what
i'm
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix

i'm
referring
to
what
judge
--

quoted
on

of
the
record.
justice
felix

yes.
justice
felix

brennan's,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
make
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
fist
place,
have
we
got
the
record
of
--
the
stenographic
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
mean
to
say,
when
the
chairman
said
it
was
our
policy,
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
you
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
is
--
goes
to
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
when
a
chairman
of
a
committee
says,
“this
is
in
our
policy
and
we
didn't
press
questions
--
we
didn't
press
witnesses
to
answer
questions,
will
tend
to
incriminate
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that's
how
you
disregard
that
even
to
considering
what
--
all
of
us
have
had
experience
with
this
kind
of
thing,
no.
that
a
hearing
like
this
in
a
continuous
thing,
witnesses
know
about
it
even
though
they
may
not
be
witnesses
at
the
time.
they
may
have
been
present
when
our
witnesses
were
called
and
they
read
about
it
in
the
newspaper.
and
here,
the
responsible
chairman
says
“this
is
our
policy”.
and
you
say
we
should
pay
no
attention
to
that.
is
that
what
it
gets
down
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
--
in
connection,
may
i
--
i
suggest
first.
the
question
is,
you
suggested
the
failure
to
direct
and
repeat,
the
command
as
such
it
is.
we
--
we
ask
a
question
because
that
complied
with,
we
want
an
answer,
i
follow
that.
that's
rational
enough
of
these
principles.
and
then,
the
witness
raises
objections.
and
then
the
chairman
or
a
member
of
the
committee
doesn't
say
what
you
answer
is
quite
their
objection.
your
interpretation
of
that
episode
of
that
inference
or
that
transaction
is,
that
imply
me
--
they
meant
to
repeat
it
because
they'd
already
asked
them
the
question
before
he
raised
his
objection,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
was
the
transition
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
you
may
--
you
must
take
the
full
context.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
question
asked,
there
was
a
refusal
intervening
question
and
refusal
was
objection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
an
objection.
and
the
question
wasn't
repeated,
it
wasn't
said
--
your
objection
is
overruled
because
you
have
no
such
claim.
i
put
it
to
you
that
it's
more
rational
to
interpret
the
failure
to
review
the
question
in
light
of
the
policy
expressed
by
the
chairman,
then
they
say
impliedly
--
impliedly
overruled
the
objection
simply
because
you
would
already
ask
the
question
before
the
objection
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
better
you
have
better
source
for
knowing
that
the
policy
of
the
commission
or
any
inquiring
bodies
on
the
chairman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
just
want
to
--
i
just
want
to
discover
out
of
what
material
is
one
to
draw
a
policy
except
the
explicit
statement
of
a
chairman,
what
the
policy
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
if
the
quality
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
correctly
interpreted
the
policy,
then
isn't
justice
stewart
right,
there
was
no
contempt
in
refusing
to
answer
if
you
acted
on
the
policy
of
the
commission
that
if
you
arrange
the
justification
for
refusal
to
answer
that
is
incriminating,
the
question
isn't
pressed
and
therefore
refusal
to
answer
isn't
contempt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
could
--
how
could
people
not
be
mislead
if
a
chairman
indicates
that
if
you
say
this
will
intend
to
incriminate
you,
you
don't
have
to
answer
and
the
chairman
doesn't
press
the
question
in
light
of
such
justification
to
refuse
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
two
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
two
things.
one
is
because
that
calls
the
general
policy,
and
two,
the
question
was
renewed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
old
record
is
not
renewed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
nearly
all
of
them.
and
therefore,
that
thing
that
finger
to
renew
gets
illumination
to
the
expression
of
the
chairman
what
the
policy
was.
namely
to
give
the
claim
of
the
privilege.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hover,
may
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
question?
as
i
understand
you
a
little
while
ago
to
say
that
the
--
the
un
--
the
unrepeated
question
after
the
claim
was
made
constitutes
the
bulk
of
the
question?
did
you
say
something
most
--
that
they
were
most
of
them?
the
questions
that
were
asked
to
which
self-incrimination
--
for
which
self-incrimination
was
invoked
and
they're
not
repeated,
constituted
the
major
portion
of
the
question
in
controversy.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
for
which
indictments
were
asked,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
that
--
on
that
--
i
thought
pursuant
authority
to
press
myself
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
reads
to
me
as
“no”.
but
they
--
the
major
portion
of
the
questions,
the
--
for
refusal
of
which
sentence
was
imposed,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
this.
assuming
that
the
unrepeated
question
cannot
be
sustained,
i'm
saying
assuming
as,
the
--
if
the
counsel
are
here
for
his
--
find
out
what
they
proposed.
assuming
that
those
cannot
be
sustained,
leaving
only
a
minority
of
questions.
assume
the
latter
can
be
can
be
sustained.
i
would
like
to
have
your
view
as
to
the
validity
of
the
sampling
imposed
in
wholesale
as
justifying
--
as
--
as
satisfying
legality.
assuming
we
sustain
you
as
to
those
few.
would
you
care
to
say
something
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
you
don't
actually
press
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
my
questions
are
irrelevant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
i
asked
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
engrossed
as
if
it
were
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
well
can
--
well
--
are
you
then
saying
that
the
sentence
can
stand
engrossed,
although
make
a
portion
of
the
underlying
convictions
are
undermined?
justice
felix

the
separate
indict
waived
for
the

for
each
question?
justice
felix

and
the
sentence
is
promulgated
to
count
to

the
sentence
runs
against
counts,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
of
them
concurrently.
justice
felix

so
that
ultimately
knocked
out,
leave
the
standing
the

sentences
for

leave
standing
the
sentences
for
good

justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
of
the
--
i
--
i
must
say
--
never
been
so
confused
about
an
immunity
situation
as
i
have
about
this
one.
as
i
understood
you
a
minute
ago
in
stating
the
law
of
ohio
which
was
news
to
me,
except
that
it
has
an
analogue
in
--
in
the
immunity
which
flows
without
asking
for
it,
under
the
sherman
antitrust
law
among
your
case
in
this
court.
but
as
i
understood
you,
the
ohio
law
is
that
a
witness
appearing
before
a
legislative
committee,
and
this
for
the
purposes
of
your
law
was
a
legislative
committee,
cannot
refuse
to
answer
because
automatically,
answer
is
compelled
in
exchange
for
an
automatically
flowing
immunity
of
the
statute
for
a
statute
giving
immunity
from
prosecution.
is
that
what
you've
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
automatic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
has
to
be
disavowed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
writing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
it
is
--
correct
me
on
this
because
i
--
on
this
--
i'm
now
walking
very
aware
of
this.
does
that
mean
that
it
is
much
as
the
immunity
statute
flows
automatically
and
has
the
least
specifically
disavowed
in
writing.
a
witness
inevitably
can't
claim
immunity
from
testifying
because
he
had
immunity
from
prosecution.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
an
immunity
statute
is
that
it
withdraws
the
right
to
withhold
answers
to
questions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
it
may
tend
to
incriminate
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
in
ohio,
there
is
automatically
immunity
from
prosecution
and
the
only
possible
rational
explanation
i
can
find
for
that
is
that
thereby,
nobody
can
give
--
claim
immunity
from
testifying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then,
there
is
an
automatic
immunity
statute,
immunity
from
prosecution
which
automatically
disables
a
witness
to
say,
“i
won't
testify
because
i
may
incriminate
myself.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
is
chairman
renner
who
presumably
was
a
lawyer,
was
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
at
any
time
tell
this
witness,
"your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
can't
be
asserted
because
the
legislature
of
ohio
has
displaced
that
immunity
with
the
immunity
from
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
how
can
the
witness
know
whether
he
did
or
didn't
have
a
right
to
claim
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
--
this
witness
should
know
more
law
than
the
chairman
did,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
the
question,
the
question
before
us
is
whether
he
will
fully
defy
the
questioning
power
of
this
committee.
and
if
he
was
misled,
you
can't
by
imposing
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
fiction,
as
an
explanation
of
understanding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
understand.
apparently,
the
ohio
law
is
almost
as
obscure
to
some
of
the
ohio
lawyers
as
it
is
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
we
go

your

the
--
the
interview
referred
to
in
--
over
a
month
by
chairman
renner
in
this
record?
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
would
like
to
know
whether
you
recall
that
interview.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
that
interview
transcribed
and
found
in
this
printed
volume?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
interview
given
between
one
of
these
petitioners
and
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
what
do
you
say
to
the
legality
of
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
i
want
to
know
whether
that
question
could
be
put
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
should
one
assume?
what
i'm
asking
is
this.
if
in
a
--
in
the
federal
court,
this
question
were
asked,
“where
do
you
live?
what
is
your
name?”
and
the
witness
says,
“i
won't
answer.”
“where
did
you
live?”
“i
won't
answer
because
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.”
i
think
i'm
clear
in
saying
that
if
--
if
that
question
were
asked
and
no
other
indication
but
that's
the
question
that
might
tend
to
incriminate,
he
couldn't
stand
on
it
furthermore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
just
say,
“i
won't
end
to
anything
because
anything
might
incriminate
me.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
might
--
was
towards
the
question,
the
--
the
--
a
question
asking
for
residence.
“where
do
you
live?”
without
more,
would
not
justify
him
in
claiming
privilege.
i
said
very
calculatingly
without
more.
now,
at
the
time
that
he
refused
to
answer
on
page
132,
there
was
nothing
whatever
except
he
asked
“where
do
you
live?”
the
man
can't
say,
i
would
raise
the
bar
on
anything
without
giving
some
intimation
so
that
the
judge,
i'm
talking
about
the
court.
there
have
been
such
cases.
you
can't
just
say,
“
i
won't
answer
anything.”
he
must
give
some
indications
so
that
the
judge
in
good
conscience
can
say,
“yes,
this
might
lead
to
something
else.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
132,
all
he
was
asking,
“where
do
you
live?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
baltimore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
from
my
point
of
view
to
indicate
something,
if
he
say,
“i
can't
answer
that
because
it
will
lead
to
something
else
or
i
would
step
up
--
somehow
rather
a
mitigation.”
you
can't
just
say
fifth
amendment,
shout
the
fifth
amendment
the
way
generally
it's
shouted
unthinkable,
fifth
amendment.
and
shut
out
all
inquiry
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
doesn't
have
to
mean
that,
he
has
to
give
some
information,
ordinarily
merely
asking
a
man
where
he
lives.
wouldn't
give
the
most
imaginative
judge
a
suggestion
that
he
can't
say
that
because
a
sequence
of
questions
might
implicate
others
if
he
gives
the
residence.
it
probably
doesn't
call
a
fact
that
you
might
address
because
other
people
live
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
there
anything
to
hind
this
denial
to
anything
that
preceded
whereby
the
chairman
or
any
fellow
has
the
responsibility.
we'll,
get
some
things
in
that
this
is
down
a
dangerous
road.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
merely
said,
“i
won't
answer,
i
won't
answer
anything.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
pulled
down
a
curtain
if
they
would
ask
for
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you've
said
that
you
might
pattern
to
our
brief
that
you
have
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that
you
--
have
you
--
have
you
briefed
this
in
the
--
what
you
just
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
question?
under
your
--
under
ohio
law,
commitment
for
contempt,
certainly
for
contempt.
does
that
require
willfulness
in
the
sense
as
purpose,
consciousness
of
--
of
--
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
about
the
law
above
your
case
laws?
justice
felix
frankfurter
usually
defying,
there
must
be
an
awareness
of
defying
the
court's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
committee's
direction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
beyond
secrets,
is
this
committee
or
committee
commission,
commission
committee,
whatever
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
still
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you're
trying
this
question
regarding
the
residence,
matters
that
has
actually
been
before
the
committee
--
commission
indicating
or
at
least
to
cast
some
light
on
what
disclosure
of
residence
might
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
the
secret
recess
of
the
--
the
committee's
mind
but
what
actually
had
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
what
we
correct
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
her
statement,
indicates
why
she
didn't
think
she
needed
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
you
will
--
i
don't
want
to
take
you
off
your
--
your
design
of
argument
but
what
was
said
in
the
previous
case.
it
would
arouse
such
curiosity,
perhaps
for
my
own
peace
of
mind,
we
can
take
care
of
it
right
now.
is
it
true
that
--
that
immunity
from
prosecution
automatically
applies
in
witnesses,
which
they
must
disavow
so
that
there
really
is
no
legal
basis
for
a
claiming
a
privilege?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
cannot
--
cannot
be
used.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
it
must
be
in
writing?
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
printed
the
statute
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly,
as
i
read
it.
and
i
know
how
perjurious
it
is
to
get
meaning
out
of
a
statute
from
a
statement
and
having
been
great
relevance
if
you
haven't
tried
this.
the
statute
says
nothing
about
the
duty
to
claim
the
immunity,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
immunity.
apparently,
it
doesn't
apply
to
fellow
who
wants
to
--
we've
got
something,
entitled
to
address
that
he
wants
to
rid
himself
of
and
force
his
way
before
the
committee
is
at
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i'm
not
--
that
was
just
a
--
my
remark.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
one
of
the
claims,
is
it?
that
--
that
she
was
denied
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
--
as
many
to
compliment
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
we
understood
the
scope
of
quinn
and
the
others
better
than
the
scope
watkins
and
the
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
quinn
--
the
quinn
problem
was
arguably
under
the
hearings,
was
it,
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
originally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
--
towards
this
ordinance,
and
their
still
purely
preliminary,
then
they
can't
be
much
in
place
about
answers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
directed
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
they
were
--
if
the
question
wasn't
read
or
if
there
wasn't
explicit
demand
to
answer
then
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they're
preliminary
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
thing
as
subsidiary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
--
even
the
legislative
commission
--
committee
--
well,
i
should
say
even
more
of
legislative
committee
than
the
court,
must
get
underway.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wish
your
extent
as
for
a
legal
instructions
were
commonly
accepted
for
all
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
suggesting
it
should
not
be
opened
to
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
ginger,
i
understand
what
you're
urging
is
subsequent
prosecution
in
another
jurisdiction,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
i
should
say
that
the
difficulty
would
arise
if
such
subsequent
prosecution
were
undertaken
rather
than
taking
away
from
the
state
of
ohio,
it's
up
to
that
time
unquestioned,
i
mean
its
power
to
elicit
the
testimony
exchange
for
not
prosecuting
with
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
that
time
just
forgetting
the
prosecution
in
another
jurisdiction.
that
certainly
cannot
be
denied
to
or
hire.
the
difficulty
arises
as
argue
of
the
threat
that
in
another
jurisdiction
by
making
this
--
by
making
this
compelled
disclosure
in
exchange
for
non-prosecution
in
ohio,
you
may
run
into
prosecution
in
the
united
states.
and
so
i
suggest
that
--
that
the
evil
is
the
prosecution
in
the
united
states
and
not
in
the
grant
of
immunity
in
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
your
--
this
argument
means
that
ohio
can't
deal
with
the
matter
because
uncle
sam
is
taking
it
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
difficulty
isn't
that
he's
denied
privilege
of
self-incrimination
but
that
he's
going
to
be
prosecuted
again.
and
therefore,
if
your
argument
is
valid,
he
can't
be
prosecuted
again
because
that
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
have
him
--
to
have
him
prosecuted
by
uncle
sam
out
of
testimony
extorted
by
him
when
he
had
no
means
of
withholding
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says
that
it
must
by
law
be
turned
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
matter
of
--
that's
maybe
a
different
ground
of
attack,
that
--
that
the
state
lent
itself
as
a
latency
of
the
federal
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
still
another
job?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
don't
want
to
make
it
too
large
out
of
legal
arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
questions
presuppose
that
your
argument
brought
the
questioning,
and
therefore,
it's
not
to
be
rejected
out
of
out
of
fairness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix

but
she
didn't
--
she
wasn't
denied
to
having
a
lawyer
was
she?
justice

wasn't

she
didn't
say
she
was
an
indigent
person
who
wanted
to
have
a
lawyer
at
the
time,
did
she?
justice

well,
it
doesn't
prevent
a

of

to
say,
”i'll
give
you
the

of

well,

we
don't

it's

it's
not
unreasonable.
it's
certainly
not

to
assume

wanted
to

that's
not
too

justice

maybe
i
should

we
don't

--
i
mean
the
record
is
blank

justice
felix

this
is
not
a
statement
of
an
undivided,
unintelligent,
non-competent
person,
was
she?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
if
she
had
or
hadn't
--
justice
felix

she
might
have
had
counsel
who'd
like
to
challenge
this
committee,
which
is

justice

justice

(voice

on
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
have
to
ask
you
something
else
about
the
--
i'm
still
confused
as
to
the
ohio
law.
i
don't
think
i
asked
you
whether
you
agree
that
--
is
it
your
view
that
the
ohio
statute
automatically
afford
immunity
from
prosecution
--
justice
felix

--
before
witness
who
appeared
before
a
legislative
committee
even
though
he
or
she
may
not
claim
the
privilege
of
--
against
self-crimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
automatically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
they
say
that?
justice
felix

they
don't
say
that.
justice
felix

but
they
do
not
say
that.
they
say
--
they
do
not
say
that.
they
do
not
say
--
they
do
no
give
the
answer
to
the
question
i
put
to
you
and
other
counsel,
namely
whether
the
mere
fact
that
your
stepping
a
legislative
committee
rule,
clothe
you
with
the
immunity
from
prosecution,
they
do
not
say
that.

read

read
it
and
everything.
but
do
they
said
that?
a
direction
to
answer
after
appellant's
refusal
upon
the
ground
of
self-incrimination
was
unnecessary
since
the
immunity
granted
to
here
included
the
possibility
of
justifying.
this
question
has
been
before
this
court
as
to
whether
you've
got
to
make
some
showing
that
you
want
to
get
something
for
something,
or
get
something
for
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
agree
with
you
if
i
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statement
of
the
chairman
isn't
an
error
because
all
he
said
is,
you
needn't
answer.
did
you
claim
the
privilege
against
self-crimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
you
don't
need
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
a
general
understanding
of
immunity
statute
is
that
he
who
has
a
dispensing
power
may
decide
whether
he
discern
prosecution
possibly
to
testify.
and
therefore,
the
chairman
cannot
be
wrong
at
all,
if
that's
the
law
of
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
since
--
or
whether
the
chairman
was
a
witness
at
the
trial
of
mrs.
morgan
for
contempt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
he
make
the
statement
at
this
trial
that
before
--
from
the
raley,
stern
and
brown
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
ask
about
this
policy
at
this
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
this
trial,
at
the
trial
on
the
--
judgment
or
sentence
before
us,
mrs.
brown
was
represented
by
counsel
--
mrs.
morgan
was
represented
by
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
chairman
examined,
cross
examined
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
this
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
morgan
trial
precede
or
follow
the
raley,
stern,
brown
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
say
it
to
merely
to
find
out?
