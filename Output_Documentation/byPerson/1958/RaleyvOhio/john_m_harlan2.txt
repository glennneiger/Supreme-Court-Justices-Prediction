could
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
point
up
an
example
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
you
are
talking?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
which
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
story
as
i
understand
it,
purported
to
reverse
in
as
the
two
as
to
whom
he
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
although
eventually,
he
dissented
across
the
board,
did
he
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
three
and
nine?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
as
for,
taking
count
number
three
of
--
that
brings
--
or
count
number
one
of
brown,
page
150
--
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
he
refuses
to
answer
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
construe
to
be
adhered
to
or
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
you
contrast
as
the
same
character
of
the
question
on
163,
referring
as
the
brown,
(inaudible)
answer
the
same
self-incrimination.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
that
the
150
instead
of
completing
the
privilege
and
simply
(inaudible)
or
suggestion
that
would
discriminate
him
about
this
conviction
by
jurisdiction
practices.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
there
was
something
in
the
record,
maybe
in
connection
with
it
where
evidence
would
bring
the
suits
under
these
witnesses
present
in
the
interrogation
of
another
witness
where
statements,
probably
with
the
kind
as
reported
as
this
privilege
that
you
made,
and
that
would
disperse
this.
is
that
the
next
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
sentence,
10
--
10
days?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
but
you
indicated
that
you
thought
that
was
the
only
question
which
there
was
a
direction
in
the
case
of
these
people.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
count
three
and
count
nine
of
the
raley
indictment.
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
also
about
count
one
of
the
stern
indictment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
one
you've
dealt
with
on
the
request.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
i
take
it,
what
you've
said
on
page
91,
you
say
that
i
nevertheless
request
an
answer
or
refer
to
as
not
to
the
question
that
was
asked
but
to
the
basis
for
--
the
claim
of
this
privilege,
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
only
--
the
other
one
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
is
page
99,
count
nine.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
witnesses
had
lawyers,
didn't
they,
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
the
thrust
of
your
argument
that
i
have
to
say
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
she's
not
being
prosecuted
here,
have
to
enlarge
so
to
speak
under
general
condemnations
conduct
which
specifically
rated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
however
--
however
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
generally
contumacious
she
may
have
been,
doesn't
quite
need
the
problem
we've
got
here,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
some
bearing,
i
don't
deny
that
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
relate
what
you're
arguing
to
what
judge
taft
said
in
his
dissent?
if
you
do
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
judge
stewart.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
stewart,
that
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
hasn't
been
discussed
but
like
the
isolated
question,
i'll
put
it
to
you.
do
you
think
that
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
ohio
to
say
that
in
construing
our
immunity
statute,
we
will
hold
a
witness
to
the
--
to
knowledge
of
the
statute
on
the
general
knowledge
of
the
immunity
statute
on
the
general
principle
and
ignorance
is
no
excuse,
ignorance
of
law
is
no
excuse?
do
you
think
that
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
understanding
of
judge
stewart's
opinion
was
that
had
it
not
been
for
what
he
found
had
been
said
by
the
chairman
contrary
to
what
the
ohio
law
was
respecting
the
right
to
claim
a
privilege.
he
would
have
joined
in
the
court's
opinion.
is
that
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
when
you
first
started
off
that
on
that
premise,
the
fact
that
this
woman
had
gone
there
with
a
predisposition
of
predetermination
not
to
answer
questions
was
an
answer
to
judge
stewart's
argument
that
she
could
have
been
mislead
by
what
the
chairman
said.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
that
the
only
reference
to
your
argument
really
to
the
issue
here?
and
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
it.
it
doesn't
have
a
strong
relevance.
it
does
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
have
strong
relevance
with
--
is
--
is
there
anything
to
--
anything
more
to
it
than
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you've
talked
about,
what
you
opened
up
with
in
saying
that
this
woman
had
come
there
with
a
predetermined
philosophy
that
she'd
answer
no
questions
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
the
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
only
trusted
view.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
--
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
read
the
majority
opinion
and
i
don't
want
to
take
time
to
go
through
them
(inaudible).
did
the
--
did
the
majority
discuss
the
question
of
judge
stewart's
--
discussed
in
his
dissent
prior
to
which
his
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
as
to
whether
she's
been
disallowed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
did?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
your
proposition
of
that
on
justice
--
justice
stewart's
argument,
namely
that
she
was
mislead,
were
concluded
by
a
finding
with
the
--
the
majority
of
the
ohio
court
that
she
was
not
misled?
justice
john
m.
harlan
good
answer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
the
supreme
court
mean
on
pages
119
when
it
said,
“does
the
witness
knew
or
was
presumed
to
know
that
under
the
statute,
her
invocation
of
the
rule
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
a
useless
act
under
the
law.”
said,
such
a
rule
of
privilege
had
been
supplanted
by
a
statute
affording
her
sufficient
immunity
from
prosecution
to
satisfy
the
protection
against
self-incrimination.
a
mere
refusal
to
answer
on
such
a
basis
constituted
contempt
and
so
forth?is
that
what
you're
referring
to
when
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
said
it
was
automatic?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
way
i
read
it
too.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
point
--
the
point
is,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
“aren't
you
right
when
you
first
suggested
that
this
ohio
supreme
court
had
construed
the
statute
in
this
case
rightly
or
wrongly,
as
providing
automatic
immunity
by
walking
into
the
legislative
room?"
