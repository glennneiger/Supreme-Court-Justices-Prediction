you
mean
they
did
not
concur
or
dissent?
chief

what
kind
of
questions
--
chief

--
did
he
answer?
what
kind
of
question
did
he
answer?
chief
justice
earl

you
may.
chief

that's
all
right.
chief

very
well.
mr.

chief

what
page,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl

but
was
he
then
directed
to
answer
that
question?
chief

where
will
we
find
that
--
chief

where
will

that
in

yes.

chief

that's
when
you
rely
on
as
a
direction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
--
assuming
that
the
chairman
was
correct
in
his
facts
that
this
man
falsely
signed
a
non-communist
affidavit
and
at
the
time
was
an
active
member
of
the
communist
party,
can
you
conceive
of
that
not
being
incriminating
if
he
--
if
he
answered
yes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
yet
this
is
one
question
that
you
say
he
directed
him
to
sign.
chief
justice
earl
warren
put
to
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
you
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
of
instances
where
he
was
indicted
and
where
he
have
been
directed
by
the
chairman
to
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
you
say
that
those
were
thrown
out
by
the
court.
they
--
chief
justice
earl

i
see.
chief

oh,
yes,
all
right.

chief

oh
--
oh,
i
see.
well,
he
did
invoke
his
rights
on
privileges
is
under
fifth
amendment,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
he'd
already
invoked
the
fifth
amendment,
hadn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
abandon
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
do
you
get
the
words
that
say
that.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
so
clear.
“and
what
has
been
your
educational
background?”
answer,
“i
refuse
to
answer
that
question,
i
invoke
my
rights
and
privileges
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
question,
”is
there
some
particular
illegal
situation
which
you
attended
or
some
communist
party
school
that
you
attended
that
makes
you
hesitate
to
reveal
where
you
were
educated?”
and
he
said,
“no,
i
just
don't
think
that's
your
business,”
having
claimed
the
fifth
amendment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
could
be
more
cross
examining
than
this.
the
question
is,
“and
what
has
been
your
educational
background?”
answer,
“i
refuse
to
answer
that
question.
i
invoke
my
rights
and
privileges
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
question,
“is
there
some
particular
illegal
institution
which
you
attended?
or
some
communist
party
school
that
you
attended
that
makes
you
hesitate
to
reveal
where
you
were
educated?”
now,
if
that
isn't
cross
examination,
what
would
you
call
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1150,
the
last
question
on
the
page.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
doesn't
this
--
doesn't
this
question
that
we've
been
talking
about
at
the
bottom
of
page
154
right
within
this
policy
that
was
stated
by
the
commissioner
or
the
chairman?
he
said,
"it
was
the
policy
of
the
commission
not
to
press
questions
which
we
felt
would
be
of
an
incriminating
nature.”
for
instance,
whenever
witness
was
asked
a
question
i
believe
that
every
witness
before
the
commission
was
asked
a
question,
“are
you
or
have
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
and
the
--
if
the
witness
refuse
to
answer
that
question,
we
did
not
press
it.
now,
take
that
and
--
and
compare
it
with
this
question
that
we've
been
talking
about.
"is
there
some
particular
illegal
institution
which
you
attended
or
some
communist
party
school
that
you
attended
that
makes
you
hesitate
to
reveal
where
you
were
educated?"
now,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
just
about
as
explicit
as
asking
a
man
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
its
just
as
incriminating,
isn't
it,
if
he
has
answered
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
not
--
was
not
pressed
yes.
and
if
you
take
that
within
--
and
placed
it
in
the
framework
of
this
policy
that
the
commission
said
it
had.
why
wasn't
--
why,
was
the
man
in
contempt
if
he
exercised
a
privilege
which
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
the
commission
itself
recognize.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rubin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
his
privilege
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
what
they
were
talking
about
was
with
the
privilege.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
just
one
hypothetical
case.
in
the
--
in
the
--
having
in
--
in
regard
your
ohio
law.
suppose
a
witness
goes
before
the
committee
and
he
has
asked
a
question
which
you
will
clearly
incriminate
him.
and
the
--
the
chairman
of
the
committee
says,
"now,
mr.
witness,
you're
--
you're
entitled
to
claim
your
privilege
of
self-incrimination
if
--
if
any
of
these
questions
--
answers
to
these
questions
would
incriminate
you.”
and
the
witness
says
"well,
mr.
chairman,
i
do
claim
my
privilege
of
self-incrimination.”
and
the
chairman
says
"you're
excused."
could
he
then
be
indicted
and
convicted
for
contempt
to
that
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
why,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
the
case
that
--
of
brown,
mr.
justice
black
having
said
that
there
was
--
that's
practically
what
happened
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
he
refused
to
answer.
they
ask
him
--
they
ask
him
a
question
which
would
have
been
incriminating.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
said,
“i
refuse
to
answer
on
the
grounds
that
will
tend
to
incriminate
me.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
--
the
chairman
then
said,
“you're
excused.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
within
--
within
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
chairman
of
the
commission
said,
“you
may
claim
your
privilege,”
but
failed
to
say,
“and
if
you
do,
nothing
will
be
done
about
it.”
do
you
think
that
distinguish
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
repudiate
the
testimony
of
your
--
the
chairman
of
your
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
--
what
language
are
you
referring
to
on
page
100?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
same
residence
they
were
asking
about
on
page
132.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnson
before
you
sit
down,
i
--
i
would
like
to
express
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
your
assumption
of
this
burden
in
this
case.
it's
an
unpopular
one,
the
unpopular
clauses
that
lawyers
ordinarily
do
not
seek
to
--
to
undertake.
and
the
fact
that
you've
been
willing
to
undertake
it
by
assignment
of
the
court
without
compensation
to
yourself
with
all
the
burdens
that
go
--
go
with
it,
entitles
you
to
the
appreciation
of
this
court,
and
i
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
gentlemen
representing
the
--
the
state
of
--
of
ohio,
we
--
we
thank
you
for
you
very
earnest
presentation
and
representation
of
the
interest
of
your

mrs.

chief

was
a
testimony
of
this
other
witness
given
on
the
same
day?
chief
justice
earl

yes.
she
was
present
at
the

chief

yes.
chief

chief

we'll

now,
mrs.--
chief

--
ginger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
allison.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
this.
it
was
stated
by
counsel
this
morning
that
she
had
the
benefit
of
the
testimony
of
a
mr.
raley
or
was
it
something
like
terrell
(ph),
who
had
just
testified
prior
to
this
and
that
he
had
--
had
stated
that
countless
meetings
were
held
at
her
home
and
--
and
things
of
that
kind,
the
things
that
would
have
incriminated
her
if
she
had
said
them
herself.
now,
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
it?
that's
all
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
hear
it
or
approach
for
a
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
let's
put
it
this
way.
would
the
testimony
of
mr.
terrell
(ph)
indicate
that
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
mrs.
morgan
called
for
answers
that
might
tend
to
incriminate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
misstated
the
name.
it
was
delong.
now,
was
there
anything
in
his
testimony
that
would
indicate
to
mrs.
morgan
or
anyone
else
that
the
asking
of
these
questions
and
the
answering
of
--
of
them
by
her
would
tend
to
incriminate
her?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
a
count
of
the
indictment
on
those
first
12
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
allison,
may
i
ask
you
think
question?
assume
that
she
did
have
an
intention
when
she
came
there
not
to
answer
any
questions,
what
--
if
the
questions
were
asked
of
her
that
--
that
would
elicit
answers
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
her?
does
she
lose
her
--
her
standing
to
--
to
claim
the
privileges
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
she
came
to
the
hearing
with
an
attitude?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
it
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
no,
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
surely.
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
attitude.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
therefore
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
let's
--
let's
stay
with
that
fifth
amendment
for
a
moment
and
just
say
--
say
this.
let's
suppose
that
she
read
the
testimony
of
mr.
john,
which
had
to
do
with
her
own
continent
to
rest
on
cert
in
--
other's
--
other's
--
other
things
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
couldn't
answer
these
question
--
any
questions
on
that
subject
matter
without
tending
to
incriminate
her.
and
perhaps
she
did
come
to
the
hearing
with
the
thought
in
mind
that
she
couldn't
without
danger
to
herself
to
answer
those
questions.
but,
if
the
--
if
the
questions
sought
to
elicit
answers
that
would
incriminate
her.
is
she
thereby
deprived
of
claiming
that
privilege?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
allison,
when
i
asked
you
the
question,
i
was
still
speaking
in
the
same
context
that
you
started
on.
you
said,
“we
will
discuss
this
for
awhile,
”shorn
of
the
question
of
pertinency
and
immunity
and
all
of
those
other
--
other
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
in
--
i
--
i
mean
shorn
of
--
of
those
things
which
should
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
bare
privileged
question,
yes.
would
she
be
deprived
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
have
your
position.
don't
let
me
interrupt
your
argument,
you
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mean
by
that
that
she's
not
entitled
to
due
process
when
she's
before
that
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
know
--
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
knew
of
no
other
case
where
--
where
a
person
was
accorded
the
privileges
of
due
--
due
process
during
the
time
that
the
crime
was
supposed
to
have
been
committed.
chief
justice

warren
being
perpetrated.
chief
justice

warren
which
means
--
which
would
mean
i
take
it
that
during
at
this
committee
hearing
where
she
was
a
witness,
she
would
not
be
entitled
to
due
process
under
your
argument.
chief

oh,
i
thought
you
said
--
chief

i
thought
you
said
--
chief
justice

haven't
there
been
a
number
of
cases
of
contempt
that
have
been
reversed
because
of

that's
