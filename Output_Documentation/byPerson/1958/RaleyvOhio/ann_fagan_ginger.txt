ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
statement
by
justice
frankfurter
as
to
whether
or
not
this
witness
needed
an
attorney
can't
be
decided
very
simply
and
the
reasons
for
not
having
one
can't
be
assumed.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
this
was
in
1952
in
columbus,
ohio
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
no.
it
is
not
a
claim
but
it
is
--
i'm
sure
that
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
understand
but
the
problems
of
lawyers
with
a
client
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
as
you
know,
are
very
many.
and
the
fact
that
mrs.morgan
stuck
so
strictly
to
the
formula
of
words
which
she
set
forth
in
her
statement
i
think
has
a
significance,
and
the
reason
we
mentioned
in
her
statement
that
she
referred
to
the
--
her
inability
to
figured
out
what
the
commission
was
doing
is
our
--
in
our
opinion,
an
effort
by
a
layman
without
counsel
to
explain
the
lack
of
pertinency
or
here
--
why
she
would
find
it
difficult
to
decide
whether
the
questions
asked
of
her
were
pertinent
to
any
matter
before
the
commission.
the
appellant
in
this
case
takes
the
position
that
this
court
had
a
reason
for
remanding
this
case
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
watkins
and
sweezy
decisions.
the
case
wasn't
remanded
in
the
light
of
bart,
emspak
and
quinn
and
we
don't
deny
of
course
that
the
problem
of
direction
to
answer
is
extremely
important
but
we
also
do
not
think
that
this
case
is
limited
to
that
issue.
the
fact
is
that
this
case
was
argued
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
but
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
i
don't
say
we
get
into
that
at
least
at
this
point
of
the
argument
but
this
case
was
argued
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
for
the
second
time,
the
day
after
the
emspak,
bart
and
quin
decisions
were
decided.
and
the
court
hadn't
had
enough
to
read
--
read
those
decisions
and
ordered
reargument.
and
on
reargument,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
a
direction
to
answer
where
you
have
an
immunity
act.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
it
was
argued
--
it
was
argued
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
originally
and
it
was
repeated
on
the
hearing.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
this
court
held
in
the
sweezy
case
that
the
responsibility
for
the
proper
conduct
of
a
less
--
legislative
investigating
committee
rest
on
the
legislature
itself.
and
if
the
lack
of
any
indications
that
the
legislative
--
legislature
wanted
the
information
which
the
investigating
body
attempted
to
elicit
must
be
treated
as
the
absence
of
authority.
now,
here,
we
have
a
stronger
case.
this
commission
was
established
in
june
of
1951.
it
called
what
are
known
as
friendly
witnesses
until
the
spring
of
1952,
and
in
april
1st,
it
called
mr.
terrell
(ph)
and
immediately
thereafter,
called
the
appellant
as
a
witness.
these
were
the
first
witnesses
who
declined
to
answer
any
questions.
a
few
months
later,
it
called
--
i
believe
it
was
a
few
months
later,
it
called
the
witnesses
who
were
involved
in
the
last
case.
january
1st,
1953,
that
is
nine
months
after
it
began
asking
questions
of
unfriendly
witnesses,
the
commission
itself
recommended
its
own
demise
and
provided
that
there
should
not
be
a
period
in
which
ohio
could
not
investigate
un-american
activities
and
therefore
proposed
a
new
statue
setting
up
a
special
assistant
attorney
general
who
would
work
on
this
problem.
and
since
they've
realized
that
it
would
take
a
few
months
for
this
legislation
to
be
passed,
they
recommended
that
their
life
be
continued
for
six
months.
in
other
words,
here,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
chairman
of
the
commission
did
not
push
the
witnesses
to
answer
questions
which
they
felt
might
be
incriminating,
in
which
the
chairman
and
other
members
of
the
commission
did
not
direct
witnesses
to
answer
their
questions
in
which
the
commission
itself
evidently
felt
that
it
should
not
continue
to
exist
because
it
not
--
did
not
serve
a
legislative
function
and
in
which
the
general
assembly
abolished
the
commission
and
instead,
set
up
a
procedure
providing
secret
hearings
for
witnesses
in
this
kind
of
case
before
a
grand
jury
and
it
evidently
accepted
this
court's
decision
in
the
nelson
case
that
this
whole
area
has
been
preemptd
by
congress
because
it
has
proceeded
in
no
way
since
that
decision,
even
under
the
special
assistant
attorney
general.
so
here,
unlike
sweezy,
we
have
a
clear
indication
that
there
was
an
absence
of
authority
in
the
commission
to
attempt
to
elicit
this
type
of
information
from
the
appellant.
this
court
also
held
in
the
sweezy
case
that
the
authorizing
resolution
must
be
studied
in
order
to
discover
the
amount
of
discretion
conferred
upon
the
investigating
committee
and
its
safeguards
can
be
nullified
when
the
committee
is
investing
with
a
broad
and
ill-defined
jurisdiction.
there
is
nothing
in
this
resolution
establishing
the
un-american
activities
commission
of
ohio
which
can
be
considered
narrow
in
scope.
the
statute
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
of
appellant,
and
you
can
see
from
the
wording
that
it
was
written
with
the
same
broad
sweep
as
that
involved
--
involved
watkins
and
sweezy.
this
commission
was
to
investigate
all
facts
relating
to
the
activities
of
person
groups,
the
persons
groups
and
organization
whose
membership
includes
persons
who
have
as
their
objective
or
maybe
suspected
of
having
as
their
objective
the
overthrow
or
reform
of
our
constitutional
governments
by
fraud,
force,
violence
or
other
unlawful
means.
all
facts
concerning
persons,
groups
and
organizations
known
to
be
or
suspected
of
being
dominated
by
or
giving
allegiance
to
a
foreign
power
or
whose
activities
might
adversely
affect
the
contribution
of
this
state
to
the
national
defense,
the
safety
and
security
of
this
state,
the
functioning
of
any
agency
of
the
state
or
national
government
for
the
industrial
potential
of
this
state.
surely,
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
statute
written
in
much
broader
language.
this
appellant
as
i
mentioned,
objected
to
the
scope
of
this
inquiry
within
her
ability
as
a
layman
and
doing
it
in
writing
in
advance
at
the
hearing
by
saying
that
no
one
could
know
what
un-american
or
subversive
meant
from
the
work
of
the
commission
up
to
the
point
at
which
she
was
called
as
a
witness.
in
addition,
no
statement
was
made
at
the
opening
of
the
hearing
concerning
the
scope
or
purpose
of
the
commission
or
of
that
particular
hearing.
and
in
fact,
the
questions
asked
of
this
witness
were
not
pertinent
to
any
matter
properly
before
a
state
legislative
investigating
committee.
some
of
the
questions
were
purely
preliminary.
for
example,
"where
do
you
reside?
are
you
a
citizen?
how
long
have
you
been
a
resident
of
franklin
county
and
where
are
you
employed?"
he
sound
like
purely
preliminary
questions.
as
to
the
question
of,
"what
--
where
do
you
reside?"
my
colleague
has
already
pointed
out
that
the
previous
day,
a
witness
had
gone
into
great
length
about,
where
the
--
where
my
client
resided
and
meetings
of
the
communist
party
had
been
held
at
her
home.
in
terms
of
her
employment,
many
of
the
questions
related
to
an
allegation
that
she
had
been
employed
by
the
community
party
of
franklin
county
or
the
state
of
ohio.
as
for
the
other
questions,
these
were
purely
preliminary.
well,
it
maybe
true
that
in
a
court
of
law
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
a
witness
cannot
merely
shout
fifth
amendment
and
proceed
to
not
answer
questions.
in
a
legislative
investigating
committee
which
is
not
a
court,
these
questions
cannot,
we
believe,
has
been
--
the
answers
could
not
possibly
have
been
of
any
help
to
the
ohio
general
assembly
in
framing
legislation.
and
therefore,
they
were
purely
preliminary.
if
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
the
--
i
think
before
a
legislative
investigating
committee,
if
they
were
purely
preliminary,
then
the
chairman
who
did
not
direct
that
they
be
answered
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
--
and
the
committee
which
did
not
urge
that
they
were
important
couldn't
have
carried
very
much
and
certainly,
the
legislature
did
not
indicate
that
they
were
interested
in
this
kind
of
thing
on
the
contrary.
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
they
specifically
say,
we've
had
a
lot
of
criticism
because
we
have
asked
questions
in
public.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
i
think
that's
true.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
we
also
maintain
that
the
commission
did
not
have
any
legitimate
function
from
the
time
it
was
founded.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
we
maintain
that
this
committee
--
commission
had
been
underway
for
some
period
of
time.
in
the
previous
day,
had
asked
the
witness
where
this
client
--
where
this
appellant
lived
and
what
she
had
done,
and
if
they
were
merely
confirming
information
which
they
already
have,
if
they
were
acting
as
a
cross-examining
body
rather
than
as
a
body
seeking
information
for
a
legislative
purpose.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
there
were
no
questions
which
were
asked
of
this
appellant
which
related
to
any
danger
to
the
state
of
ohio
from
overthrow.
and
all
the
questions
which
were
not
preliminary
related
to
matters
which
were
involving
political
activity
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
all
the
questions
which
were
not
preliminary
related
to
the
field
of
subversive
activity
on
a
national
scale,
a
field
which
the
federal
government
has
wisely
preempted.
and
in
your
nelson
decision,
you
point
out
the
problems
that
would
arise
if
you
had
separate
investigation
into
subversive
activities
by
each
state.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
in
addition
to
which
all
of
the
questions
which
were
not
preliminary,
were
within
one
area.
and
under
the
yates
decision,
where
a
witness
draws
the
lines
of
refusal
by
declining
to
answer
within
an
area,
the
prosecutor
cannot
multiply
contempt
by
further
questions
in
that
area.
this
witness
was
indicted
for
37
counts
of
contempt
and
all
of
the
counts
from
six,
i
think,
on
related
to
the
single
area
a
communist
party
activity.
this
court
held
in
the
sweezy
case
that
legislative
investigative
committees
can
encroach
on
the
constitutional
liberties
of
the
individual.
and
that
unquestionably,
there
was
such
an
invasion
of
sweezy's
liberty
in
the
area
of
political
expression.
in
the
sweezy
case
by
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire,
an
area
in
which
government
should
be
extremely
reticent
to
threat.
and
the
court
said,
"we
do
not
now
conceive
of
any
circumstances
wherein
a
state
interest
would
justify
infringement
of
rights
in
these
fields."
but
you
continued
on
that
point
to
say
that
you
didn't
have
to
reach
this
question
because
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
had
recognized
there
was
nothing
to
connect
the
questioning
of
the
petitioner
with
the
fundamental
interest
of
the
state
in
preventing
its
course
of
an
overthrow.
now,
we
maintain
the
facts
here
are
very
similar.
the
statute
itself
establishing
the
commission
required
the
commission
to
invade
the
appellant's
liberty
of
political
expression.
it
required
that
questions
be
asked
which
could
not
but
affect
appellant
and
other
citizens
of
ohio
in
their
free
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
and
the
questions
could
not
have
provided
the
commission
or
the
legislature
with
any
new
facts
relating
to
possible
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
ohio.
they
rather
dealt
into
appellant's
pass
conduct
in
order
to
corroborate
information
already
in
the
possession
of
the
commission.
in
other
words,
we
maintain
that
the
statute
establishing
the
commission
was
unconstitutional
as
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
guaranteed
to
this
witness
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
we
come
to
the
problem
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
faced.
they
were
not
willing
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
first
amendment
rights
either
before
watkins
and
sweezy
were
handed
down
or
thereafter,
nor
would
they
prepare
to
discuss
the
points
that
this
court
had
made
on
the
responsibility
of
the
legislature
over
investigation.
no
opinion
was
written
after
the
argue
--
reargument
on
remand
from
this
court.
nor
is
the
court
willing
to
discuss
the
problem
of
the
broadly
worded
statute
and
that
there
was
no
method
for
determining
the
pertinency
of
the
question.
none
of
these
things
where
ever
discussed
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
any
written
opinion.
they
merely
affirmed
the
conviction
without
opinion.
they
therefore
rested
their
whole
opinion
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
an
immunity
act
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
that
the
statute
does
not
require
a
direction
to
answer.
and
that
therefore,
they
were
not
found
by
this
court's
decision
in
emspak,
bart
and
quinn
which
said
that
in
a
federal
case,
there
must
be
a
direction
to
answer.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
a
state
seeks
to
have
this
court
affirm
a
conviction
for
contempt
in
the
absence
of
any
direction
to
answer.
in
the
regan
case
for
example,
there
was
a
direction
to
answer.
the
united
states
statute
in
the
emspak,
bart
and
quinn
case
says
nothing
about
a
direction
to
answer
no
more
than
does
the
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio.
but
this
court
felt
that
there
must
be
a
clear
disposition
of
the
witness'
objection
as
a
prerequisite
to
prosecution
for
contempt.
while
it
is
true
that
the
state
of
ohio
is
governed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
in
the
interpretation
of
its
statutes
and
we
cannot
claim
that
there
is
a
violation
of
due
process
within
the
meaning
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
or
the
ohio
constitution
by
fair
which
direct
to
answers
since
the
ohio
supreme
court
says
this
is
not
required.
we
do
claim
that
there
is
a
denial
of
the
right
of
the
appellant
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
when
you
say
to
her
in
effect
after
the
fact,
"you
should
have
answered
because
you
would
--
were
clothed
with
immunity
from
the
time
you
walk
into
the
hearing
room.
she
had
a
right
to
a
clear-cut
choice
between
refusing
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
answering
and
being
clothed
with
immunity
from
prosecution
by
the
state
only
in
an
area
where
prosecution
by
the
federal
government
was
not
only
possible
but
probable
in
that
time
at
the
period.
the
court
held
--
this
court
held
in
emspak,
bart
and
quinn
that
their
giving
a
direction
to
answer
is
a
minimal
procedural
requirement.
and
that
failure
to
do
so
is
the
defect
in
laying
the
foundation
for
a
prosecution.
we
feel
that
the
same
situation
applies
here.
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
witness
would
have
given
the
same
answer
if
she
had
been
given
a
clear-cut
choice,
it's
impossible
to
know.
the
fact
that
she
wrote
statement
and
handed
it
to
the
commission
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing,
does
not
mean
that
if,
the
chairman
of
the
commission
had
said,
“now,
you
must
understand,
mrs.
morgan,
that
if
you
do
not
answer
these
questions,
you
will
be
cited
for
a
contempt
and
you
must
understand
it
if
you
do
answer
them,
you
cannot
be
prosecuted
by
the
state
of
ohio
because
we're
granting
you
with
immunity.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
she
wouldn't
have
been.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
she
stuck
so
closely
to
this
formula
of
words
in
answering
each
question,
indicates
that
she
was
without
counsel
that
she
had
thought
the
thing
out
in
advance
and
that
she
was
not
capable,
she
didn't
feel
that
she
would
be
capable
of
finding
a
new
formulation
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
i
don't
think
it,
that
here
rigidity
in
answering
indicates
a
rigidity
in
her
ability
to
reason
but
rather
a
fear
of
this
hearing
and
of
her,
the
fact
she
wasn't
a
lawyer
and
that
she
was
dealing
with
lawyers.
certainly,
it
is
impossible
to
know
what
the
witness
would
have
done
if
she
had
directed
to
answer
since
she
wasn't
directed
to
answer.
and
it
can't
be
said
that
it
wasn't
until
after
the
12th
question
that
in
the
indictment
--
that
the
chairman
told
here
she
could
use
the
fifth
amendment.
she
have
sat
in
a
hearing
room
while
mr.
terrell
(ph)
was
interrogated.
and
mr.
terrell
(ph)
had
been
told
by
the
chairman
that
he
did
not
have
to
answer
the
question
if
it
might
incriminate
him.
and
certainly,
she
listened
to
this
i'm
sure
with
considerable
interest
and
was
affected
by
this
from
the
first
question
forward.
it
cannot
be
held
either
that
the
immunity
act
in
ohio
is
sufficient
to
erase
the
privilege.
there
can
be
no
contention
that
a
--
an
immunity
granted
by
the
state
of
ohio
even
if
it
did
clothe
her
with
a
complete
immunity
from
prosecution
in
the
state
of
ohio
from
the
moment
she
walk
into
the
room.
and
even
it
is
assumed
that
this
immunity
took
effect
without
anything
being
said
about
its
existence
and
without
any
mention
being
made
to
her
that
it
was
being
granted
to
her.
it
cannot
be
claimed
if
immunity
erased
the
privilege
within
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
olman
case
because
we
have
in
this
country
two
sovereignties
that
act
upon
each
individual
at
any
given
moment.
and
in
this
case,
the
united
states
had
taken
an
active
interest
in
the
prosecution
of
the
person's
forced
subversive
activities.
you
can't
claim
that
a
--
an
immunity
granted
by
the
state
of
ohio
would
have
had
any
effect
whatever
in
a
prosecution
against
this
witness
under
federal
law.
and
therefore,
it
is
untrue
to
suggest
that
the
immunity
act
had
been
applied
at
all
to
her,
erased
here
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
this
court
has
never
heard
a
case
in
which
the
double
--
double
sovereignty
question
arose
in
terms
of
immunity
where
there
was
a
legislative
investigating
committee
involved.
all
of
the
cases
before
this
court,
i
think,
from
brown
against
walker,
to
whole
list,
involved
grand
jury
proceedings.
and
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
grand
jury
and
a
legislative
investigating
committee.
in
a
grand
jury,
the
proceedings
are
secret
and
there
would
be
no
way
for
a
prosecutor
in
another
jurisdiction
to
know
what
is
said
in
the
grand
jury
minutes.
unless
there
is
illusion
between
the
state
and
federal
prosecuting
attorneys
which
one
would
not
assume.
therefore,
the
decisions
which
this
court
has
handed
down,
jack
against
kansas,
brown
against
walker,
united
states
against
murdock
and
the
others
including
knapp
against
schweitzer
do
not
settle
the
matter
here.
the
fact
is
that
wherever
there
has
been
an
actual
livelihood
or
probability
of
prosecution
in
the
second
jurisdiction,
this
court,
as
justice
holmes
said
one
way
or
the
other
has
not
--
has
not
found
the
person
guilty
of
contempt
for
refusal
to
answer
and
that
was
true
in
bowman
against
bates,
it
was
construing
united
states
against
saline
bank
and
then
other
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
the
--
you
cannot
read
the
fact
in
these
cases,
jack
against
kansas
and
the
others
and
separate
them
without
separating
them
from
the
theory
profoundrd
because
in
none
of
those
cases
was
there
the
kind
of
threat
of
prosecution
in
the
second
jurisdiction,
which
existed
in
this
case.
this
was
april
of
1952,
there
were
smith
act
prosecutions
going
on
throughout
the
united
states
and
there
were
also
state
prosecutions
going
on
for
the
same
kind
of
activity.
under
state
of
ohio
had
at
one
time,
prosecuted
a
witness
under
its
state
criminal
syndicalism
law.
so
that
there
was
such
a
law
on
the
books
and
it
was
known
to
the
prosecutors.
and
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
witness
here
before
the
state
committee
was
immune
from
such
federal
prosecution
or
that
the
danger
was
in
any
way
improbable
or
they
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
right.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
don't
think
there
is
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
i
don't
think
despite
the
brief
by
my
worthy
opponent
that
the
sovereign
state
of
ohio
has
ever
had
the
jurisdiction
to
ask
a
person
questions
or
to
prosecute
them
for
something
they
may
have
done
against
the
united
states
government.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
no,
i
don't
thinks
so.
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
decision
in
the
nelson
case
which
came
down
after
this
questioning
occurred
represented
sound
thinking
on
the
part
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
which
had
considered
this
matter
for
sometime
and
which
had
considered
also
the
statements
by
the
united
states
officials,
both
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
correct,
but
i
would
go
further
and
i
would
say
that
on
any
matter
in
which
the
federal
and
state
jurisdictions
can
both
act
upon
an
individual,
you
cannot
erase
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
unless
the
person
is
clothed
with
immunity
from
prosecution
in
both
jurisdictions
and
that
any
other
reading
of
the
immunity
act
or
of
the
constitution
would
result
in
the
denial
of
due
process
to
the
individual.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
yes.
but
i
think
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
think,
that's
true
but
i
think
you
would
agree
that
it
is
a
very
--
it
would
take
a
witness
with
more
that
one
lawyer
to
feel
at
ease
in
answering
a
question
before
a
state
legislative
committee
knowing
that
this
testimony
must
by
law
be
turned
over
to
a
federal
prosecutor
and
the
--
with
no
assurance
which
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
the
statute
requires
disclosure
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
right.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
all
right.
well,
i'm
now
stating
it
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
this
case,
it
may
seem
odd
to
say
has
been
in
the
courts
for
seven
years.
well,
it
may
seem
simple
to
settle
it
on
the
question
of
direction
to
answer
and
we
are
not
suggesting
it
shouldn't
be
settled
on
that
point.
we've
argued
the
case
four,
five
times
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
we
are
not
prepared
to
omit
any
point
since
that
court
has
seemed
fit
to
decide
it
so
many
times
against
us.
i
think,
that
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
we
--
we
take
many
positions
on
immunity
at
some
of
which
we
believe,
you
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
might
agree
with
us,
some
which
we
assume
you
may
not
agree
with,
but
we
took
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
correct.
but
on
the
question
of
double
sovereignty,
your
word
is
one
that
we
are
concerned
with
along
with
the
other
members
of
the
bench
because
you
have
written
about
it
so
extensively.
and
the
--
we
have
several
positions
on
the
immunity
question.
one
is
that
she
was
never
directed
to
answer
and
affords
no
other
rights
were
at
any
given
a
moment.
one
of
this
is
not
the
same
as
knapp
against
schweitzer
because
that
was
a
grand
jury
where
the
proceedings
were
secret
and
here
there
was
a
great
likelihood
of
prosecution
by
the
federal
government.
we
also
say
that
the
statute
required
disclosure
and
liaison
between
the
state
to
federal
officials
as
to
any
matter
testified
to.
and
we
also
say
that
fundamentally,
the
immunity
granted
by
one
jurisdiction
is
not
sufficient
unless
it
covers
in
the
tread
of
prosecutions
from
the
second
jurisdiction
which
also
could
prosecute
for
the
same
crime.
the
state
of
ohio
has
concerned
itself
with
the
question
of
the
--
its
sovereignty
and
seems
to
be
concern
that
it
is
in
danger
of
losing
its
sovereignty
if
this
court
reverses
the
conviction
of
appellant
on
these
facts.
and
yet,
this
is
the
first
time
that
ohio
has
had
to
consider
the
legislative
immunity
act
for
the
problem
of
contempt
in
the
face
of
this
immunity
act.
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
earlier
asked
what
the
immunity
act
provided
or
provide
case
law
at
this
point,
there
has
never
been
a
prior
case
in
which
this
issue
arose
and
there
has
never
been
a
case
of
contempt
of
the
ohio
legislature
or
the
ohio
legislative
investigating
committee
involved
in
any
field
other
than
corruption
in
government.
and
i
think
this
speaks
well
for
the
sovereign
state
of
ohio.
but
until
1952,
they
never
got
into
a
field
of
legislative
inquiry
outside
the
field
of
corruption
in
government.
it
is
important
of
course
that
in
ohio,
the
investigating
committees
which
have
operated
have
in
the
past
not
attempted
to
question
private
individuals
of
particularly
about
their
political
beliefs
or
actually
about
anythingelse.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
yes,
sir.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
may
it
please
the
court.
very
--
i
think
it
may
help
even
at
this
late
date
to
go
back
over
the
fact
in
this
case
because
i
don't
think
they've
been
presented
in
chronological
order
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
absolutely
clear.
first,
i
would
like
to
say
though
as
a
sort
of
a
joke
that
if
it
is
true
that
nothing
was
further
from
the
mind
of
the
witness
during
her
testimony,
then
the
problem
of
pertinency,
i
would
say
that
there
was
nothing
further
from
the
mind
of
the
chairman
and
the
other
members
of
the
commission
than
the
existence
of
an
ohio
immunity
act.
the
last
day
of
march
1952,
hearings
were
held
in
columbus
by
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
and
one
john
delong
testified
at
length
concerning
one
anna
morgan.
and
he
discussed
where
she
lived,
what
her
position
in
the
communist
party
was
and
the
kind
of
work
she
had
done.
the
following
day
was
april
1st,
1952
and
on
that
day,
four
witnesses
where
called
before
the
commission.
the
first
one
was
mr.
terrell
(ph),
the
second
one
was
mrs.
morgan.
in
other
words,
on
march
31st
in
columbus,
john
delong
was
question
that
was
a
friendly
witness
and
discussed
at
length
appellant.
the
following
day,
she
was
the
second
witness
to
appear.
first
--
first
witness,
mr.
terrell
(ph),
my
also
representative
at
that
time,
not
in
the
hearing
but
in
the
trial,
it
was
a
companion
case
with
this
at
one
time,
was
asked
a
number
of
questions,
all
of
which
she
declined
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment.
whether
he
was
asked,
whether
he
knew
anna
morgan,
i
don't
recall.
in
any
event,
during
his
testimony
as
we've
discussed
several
times
now,
he
was
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
any
question,
the
answer
to
--
which
might
incriminate
you,
otherwise
you
are
required
to
answer
at
page
11
or
page
62
of
the
record.
mrs.
morgan
was
or
was
not
present
during
the
testimony
of
john
delong.
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that.
certainly,
that
was
an
open
hearing
and
it
was
reported
in
the
present,
she
was
well
aware
of
it
when
she
came
into
the
hearing,
the
following
day
with
a
prepared
statement
and
she
definitely
was
in
the
hearing
room
at
the
time
that
mr.
terrell
(ph)
was
questioned
and
then
she
heard
chairman
renner
make
the
statement
to
mr.
terrell
(ph).
therefore,
while
it
is
true
that
she
came
in
with
a
prepared
statement,
it
is
also
true
that
she
knew
that
her
name
had
come
up
in
the
hearing
the
previous
day
and
she
had
heard
the
prior
witness
given
a
certain
advice.
i
do
not
see
how
anyone
can
know
what
she
would
have
done
if
mr.
terrell
(ph)
had
been
given
a
different
kind
of
advise.
she
might
or
might
not
have
put
her
statement
into
the
record.
that's
i
think
impossible
to
say.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well
,i
don
t
think
you
can
be
concluded
in
a
finding
that
she
was
not
misled
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
denial
of
a
federal
right
to
be
informed
of
her
status
at
that
time
if
the
ohio
supreme
court
wishes
to
say
that
the
standards
of
due
process
in
ohio
will
permit
a
conviction
for
a
contempt
in
the
face
of
these
facts.
this
court
couldn't
go
into
that,
but
i
think
this
court
reading
the
fact,
can
conclude
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
to
find
someone
guilty
of
contempt
for
a
willful
refusal
which
is
the
wording
of
the
indictment,
a
willful
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
in
the
face
of
these
facts.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
the
witness
was
called
to
testify
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
turn
in
her
statement.
now,
her
statement
says
two
things
which
i
think
are
of
interest.
one
is
that,
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
my
argument
before,
that
in
all
these
months,
the
commission
has
failed
to
state
what
it
considers
un-american
or
subversive.
that's
at
page
57
of
the
record.
now,
while
this
is
not
a
lawyer's
way
of
saying,
“i
can't
figure
out
what's
pertinent
to
the
matter
under
inquiry.”
i
think
it
is
a
layman's
way
of
saying,
“i
can't
figure
out
what
is
pertinent
to
the
matter
under
inquiry.”
she
also
said
in
her
statement
that
the
--
because
this
committee
conducts
its
hearings
like
an
inquisition
with
no
rules
of
evidence.
it
--
its
victims
are
denied
the
rights
which
they
would
have
in
a
duly
constituted
court.
therefore,
i
must
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
remain
silent
before
this
committee.
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
clear
statement
which
if
she
had
--
had
a
lawyer,
she
might
have
made
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
but
without
a
lawyer,
she
wrote
it
down
in
advance
so
that
she
would
clearly
had
made
her
point.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
no,
you
can't
go
out
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
there
is
no
such
provision
before
a
legislative
committee
that
you
can
get
a
counsel.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
i
would
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
might
say
if
i
may
go
outside
of
the
record
that
this
subpoena
was
served
and
this
client
attempted
very
--
with
a
great
deal
of
diligence
to
find
counsel
in
the
city
of
columbus
and
wasn't
able
to
do
so.
i
was
at
that
time
a
lawyer
from
cleveland
and
came
into
the
case
a
good
deal
later.
there
were
no
cleveland
lawyers.
they
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
but
this
was
a
cleveland
bar
and
it
was
a
little
later
after
things
had
changed
a
little
in
the
state
of
ohio.
this
is
columbus
in
april
1st,
1952.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
know
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
think
it
is
in
terms
of
an
investigation
before
this
commission
or
the
un-american
activities
committee.
i
have
heard
of
no
instance.
maybe
--
it's
certainly
in
no
instance
until
1955
or
1956.
if
there
have
been
any
since
then,
i'm
delighted.
i
know
of
no
instance
until
at
least
1955
in
which
any
bar
association
or
anyone
else
offered
counsel
for
a
legislative
committee,
not
a
court.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
believe
knowing
the
client
and
knowing
the
other
clients
who
also
came
in
with
out
counsel
that
that
is
sensible
as
of
that
year,
yes.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
the
record
is
blank,
i
know,
but
did
it
not
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
no,
this
is
a
statement
of
a
person
who
had
read
the
newspapers,
but
had
not
consulted
a
counsel
because
it
--
it's
clear
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
if
she
had
consulted
counsel,
she
would
have
been
told
certainly
to
apply,
to
--
to
mention
article
1
section
10
of
the
ohio
constitution.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
possible.
i
prefer
to
assume
that
the
members
of
the
columbus
bar
had
they
given
a
counsel
would
have
said,
“use
article
1
section
10
of
the
ohio
constitution.”
the
fact
that
she
didn't
mention
that
section,
which
relates
to
self-incrimination
convinces
me
as
to
whether
things
outside
of
the
record
that
her
failure
to
have
counsel
was
not
a
matter
of
her
own
choice.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that
may
well
be.
i
won't
get
into
a
discussion
of
this
matter
beyond
saying
that
i
--
it
is
significant
that
both
this
client
and
two
others
who
took
a
similar
position
appeared
without
counsel.
i
represented
all
related.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
correct.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
unfortunately,
i
neither
wrote
the
statute
nor
i
can't
--
it's
my
interpretation
of
it
of
any
value.
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
it
involved
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
--
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
said
this
could
be
done
without
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
what
they
said.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
in
their
opinion.
they
say,
“you
don't
have
to
be
given
a
direction
to
answer
and
this
will
automatically
clothe
with
immunity
from
the
time
you
walk
into
the
room.”
and
therefore,
there
is
no
reason
to
give
a
direction
doing
it,
sir.
i
don't
know
how
quickly
i
can
find
it
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
if
they
don't
then
that's
fine
because
i
would
agree
with
them.
i
thought
that
i
--
my
interpretation
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
it
is
a
--
that
you
cannot
assume
that
a
person
has
immunity
unless
you
give
it
to
them.
i
think
you
cannot
have
an
operation
of
an
immunity
act
until
a
witness
is
asked
a
question,
he
refuses
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
self-incrimination.
you
directed
to
answer
the
question
and
then
he
is
told
as
to
his
refusal
to
answer
is
not
accepted
and
he
is
then
offered
immunity
and
at
that
point,
he
refuses
to
answer
and
then
he's
in
contempt.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
have
been
all
with
my
understanding
and
i
found
no
case
other
than
this
one
in
which
this
was
permitted.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
delighted.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
in
other
words,
he
were
saying,
"we
were
not
giving
you
any
immunity."
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
in
other
words,
he
were
saying,
“we
are
not
in
this
case
giving
you
any
immunity.”
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
right.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
well,
i
would
agree
with
you
and
i
think
that
that
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
yes.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
yes,
i
--
i
can't
read
it
in
any
other
way.
i
think
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
the
problem
is
that
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
the
members
of
the
commission
clearly
had
either
never
heard
of
the
immunity
act
or
they
didn't
think
it
applied
to
this
commission
and
therefore,
they
didn't
mention
it.
we
cannot
argue
here
whether
this
was
a
commission
or
a
committee,
but
the
fact
of
matter
is
that
it
was
a
matter
in
dispute.
i
don't
think
the
commission
felt
at
ease.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that
would
to
be
true.
i
would
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
questions
that
were
asked
because
i
don't
want
to
miss
the
--
the
problem
of
whether
the
questions
where
preliminary
or
not.
the
first
question
was
her
name
which
she
gave.
the
second
question
was,
"where
do
you
reside
--
reside?"
and
to
that,
she
said,
and
i
do
not
think
the
language
was
either
vitriolic
or
highly
abusive.
"i
regret
that
i
cannot
answer
your
question
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
because
to
do
so
would
give
your
committee
an
opportunity
to
incriminate
me."
she
was
then
immediately
asked.
“now,
mrs.
morgan,
would
you
explain
to
the
commission
how
revealing
your
address
of
which
you
were
served
with
the
subpoena
by
the
sheriff
of
franklin
county
would
tend
to
incriminate
you?”
the
first
question,
“where
do
you
reside?”
became
count
one
in
the
indictment.
on
this,
she
was
convicted
and
fined.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
page
49
of
the
record.
on
page
50
of
the
record,
the
first
question
on
that
page,
“now,
mrs.
morgan,
would
you
explain
to
the
commission
how
revealing
your
address?”
that
became
count
two
in
the
indictment
and
that
was
on
trial.
this
was
--
she
was
acquitted
on
that
count
as
not
pertinent
to
the
matter
under
inquiry.
she
was
then
asked,
“are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?”
and
she
said,
“i
appeal
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
commission
said,
“you
say
you
feel
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
“i
continue
to
feel
under
the
fifth
amendment
not
to
answer
that
question.”
"does
that
mean
that
you
refuse
to
answer?"
answer,
“i
refuse
to
answer
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
"and
by
the
refusal
to
answer
under
the
fifth
amendment,
you
say
to
answer
would
tend
to
incriminate
you."
answer,
“yes.”
now,
the
question
has
come
up
whether
her
refusal
to
answer,
whether
she
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
was
a
frivolous
answer
or
one
in
which
there
was
no
basis
for
fear
of
incrimination.
the
fact
that
the
matter
is
that
this
was
a
woman
who
could
--
who
was
aware
of
the
possibility
of
denaturalization
action.
if
you
wish
to
call
this
a
prosecution
or
not,
i
don't
know
if
that's
important.
a
denaturalization
case
may
not
be
considered
formally
a
criminal
matter,
but
there
--
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
it's
not
in
the
record.
she
was
native
born.
she
had
married
during
the
period
when
you
lose
your
citizenship
and
she
had
later
become
a
citizen
over
again
through
naturalization
and
she
was
aware
of
these
facts
when
she
testified.
nothing
of
this
is
in
the
record
however,
but
she
was
asked,
“do
you
--
would
the
answer
to
incriminate
you?”
and
she
answered,
“yes,
it
would.
yes.”
then,
she
was
asked
what
the
fifth
amendment
was
and
she
just
kept
saying,
“fifth
amendment,
fifth
amendment.”
now,
it
maybe
that
the
state
of
ohio
supreme
court,
reading
this
record,
thinks
this
was
a
very
strange
witness.
they
asked
her,
“what
is
the
fifth
amendment?”
and
she
merely
says,
“i
am
appealing
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
i
do
not
think
it
is
strange
for
--
for
a
client
without
counsel
to
be
fairly
careful
of
her
answers
in
this
kind
of
a
hearing.
it
maybe
she
was
intelligent
enough
to
write
a
statement
in
a
quieter
room.
but
to
think
on
her
feet
and
give
an
accurate
answer,
a
careful
answer
which
wouldn't
waive
any
right,
i
think
at
that
stage
of
the
law,
1952,
what
a
person
would
know
from
newspapers,
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear.
this
wasn't
a
rigid
person
who
was
denying
the
possibility
of
a
discussion.
she
was
merely
afraid
to
get
away
from
a
formula
which
she
thought
was
safe.
the
next
count
in
indictment,
the
question
was,
“how
long
have
you
been
a
resident
of
franklin
county,
mrs.
morgan?”
and
she
said
--
she
continued
to
appeal
--
appeal
under
the
fifth
amendment.
for
this,
she
was
fined.
and
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
this
is
purely
a
preliminary
question.
it
could
have
had
no
significance,
unless
it
is
somehow
connected
with
the
last
count
in
the
indictment
which
i
will
read
when
i
come
to
it.
then,
she
was
asked,
“where
are
you
employed
as
count
five?”
on
that
count,
she
was
fined.
and
you
will
find
throughout
the
questioning
a
number
of
questions
later
on
indicating
that
she
had
been
a
paid
communist
party
organizer,
count
12,
count
14,
both
indicate
these.
so
that,
her
concern
over
answering,
"where
are
you
employed
and
her
refusal
to
answer
under
the
privilege
makes
sense
when
you
read
the
later
questions.
the
next
count
on
which
she
was
fined
was,
“mrs.
morgan,
are
you
now
or
have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
and
the
continuing
count
thereafter
all
relate
to
the
communist
party
until
you
get
into
count
28,
i
believe.
now,
count
seven
was
--
on
count
seven,
she
was
acquitted
in
the
common
pleas
court
after
trial,
as
its
being
identical
with
count
six
and
36.
in
other
words,
we
argued
at
the
trial
court
that
these
questions
were
repetitious
and
that
they
were
not
pertinent,
and
two
of
the
questions
were
thrown
out
on
the
ground
of
no
pertinency.
that
is
the
question
at
the
top
of
page
50
and
the
question
at
the
bottom
of
page
55
concerning
the
civil
rights
congress.
both
of
those
counts
were
thrown
out
on
the
ground
of
no
pertinency.
and
counts
six
and
30
--
count
seven
and
36
were
thrown
out
on
the
ground
of
their
being
repetitious.
our
argument
--
our
only
argument
with
the
trial
court
was
that
they
should
have
thrown
out
all
of
the
counts
from
seven
on,
on
the
ground
that
they
were
identical
with
seven,
before
that
sole
reason.
in
terms
of
the
answer
as
to
her
home,
in
addition
to
the
problem
which
i
mentioned
before
about
delong
having
testified
concerning
meetings
having
been
held
at
her
home,
the
counts
in
11
--
17
and
18,
and
19,
and
20,
and
21,
and
24,
and
25,
and
26,
all
asked
questions
connecting
her
home
with
communist
party
headquarters
or
communist
party
meetings.
so,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
was
an
honest
claim
of
the
privilege
in
connection
with
her
testimony.
i
would
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
while
it
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
decide
this
case
and
to
reverse
the
conviction
of
this
appellant
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
failure
to
direct
to
answer
and
the
failure
to
show
a
willful
refusal
to
answer
in
the
face
of
the
statement
by
the
chairman
that
she
need
not
answer,
there
are
pending
now
in
ohio
20
similar
cases
before
this
same
commission
which
is
now
the
debunked
and
it
would
be
of
considerable
value
if
this
court,
considering
this
case
on
--
for
the
second
time
on
--
acted
a
remand
under
watkins
and
sweezy
if
the
court
covered
issues
beyond
the
direction
to
answer
and
the
failure
to
show
a
willful
refusal
to
answer.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
yes,
yes.
that's
in
the
record.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
no,
he
made
that
statement
in
that
case
and
he
did
not
make
that
statement
here.
he
talked
about
the
purposes
of
the
commission
and
he
did
not
make
a
general
statement.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
no.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
that's
correct.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
yes.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
yes.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
i
think
it
preceded
it.
ms.
ann
fagan
ginger
very
shortly
before
it.
there
was
a
delay
of
a
year
in
--
by
the
trial
court
and
deciding
a
demurrer
which
i
filed,
which
they
overruled
but
there
was
a
year's
delay
so
that
--
although
the
testimony
in
morgan
was
taken
earlier
and
the
testimony
in
the
raley
case,
the
trials
was
very
close
to
each
other.
