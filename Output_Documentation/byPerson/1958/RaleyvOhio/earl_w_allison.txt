mr.
earl
w.
allison
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
members
of
the
court.
i
have
sat
in
this
chamber
yesterday
afternoon
and
this
afternoon
during
the
presentation
of
the
arguments
in
the
raley,
stern,
and
brown
cases
which
our
companion
cases
to
the
instant
case
and
also
to
the
arguments
presented
to
this
court
in
the
instant
case.
i
have
listened
to
the
questions
propounded
of
counsel
by
various
members
of
the
court.
i
feel
it
is
my
first
duty
to
the
state
of
ohio
and
to
this
court
to
clarify
certain
issues
which
in
my
mind
at
least
certainly
need
clarification.
before
attempting
to
do
that,
i
would
like
to
explain
to
this
court
my
own
relationship
to
the
instant
case.
the
hearing
in
the
instant
case
was
held
in
columbus,
ohio
in
1952.
columbus
is
the
county
seat
of
franklin
county,
ohio.
so,
that
if
a
contempt
occurred,
it
occurred
in
franklin
county.
at
that
time,
neither
then
nor
before
nor
since
did
i
have
or
have
i
had
any
connection
with
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission,
either
as
a
member
or
its
counsel
or
any
other
association.
the
record
of
that
hearing
was
presented
to
the
then
prosecuting
attorney
of
franklin
county,
and
by
him
to
the
franklin
county
grand
jury
and
an
indictment
was
returned.
that
indictment
was
for
one
thing
and
one
thing
alone,
legislative
contempt
and
let
me
point
out
this
is
a
first
difference
between
the
instant
case
and
the
raley,
stern,
and
brown
cases
which
were
under
the
judicial
contempt
proceedings.
the
trial
of
this
case
was
held
by
a
successor
prosecuting
attorney
to
the
--
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
who
had
first
secured
the
indictment.
by
that
time,
i
was
an
assistant
in
that
office
and
in
fact,
prepared
the
trial
brief
in
this
case.
the
appeals
were
held
under
still
another
prosecuting
attorney,
now,
congressman
samuel
l.
devine
from
the
twelfth
district
of
ohio.
i
also
handled
those
appeals
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
four
occasions.
when
congressman
devine
left
that
office,
i
was
appointed
by
the
common
pleas
court
of
our
county
to
succeed
him.
in
other
words,
i
have
inherited
a
case
which
i
have
personally
handled
for
five
and
one-half
years.
standing
here
representing
the
state
of
ohio,
i
am
not
on
my
own
of
the
responsibility
placed
on
my
shoulders
in
that
capacity,
but
i
want
to
assure
this
court
in
all
sincerity
that
i
have
lived
with
this
case
for
five
and
a
half
years
and
i
say
under
the
shadow
of
my
own
oath,
which
i
took
to
uphold
and
defend
both
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
my
arguments
represent
my
own
personal
deep
and
abiding
convictions
or
i
would
not
be
here.
the
morgan
case
cannot
be
decided
on
the
facts
of
any
other
case.
it
cannot
be
decided
on
the
facts
of
the
raley,
stern,
and
brown
cases.
it
cannot
be
decided
on
the
facts
of
the
sweezy
and
watkins
cases
or
the
bart,
emspak,
and
quinn
cases.
it
must
be
decided
on
its
own
facts.
so,
for
a
moment,
let's
place
the
morgan
case
before
this
court.
let's
place
it
here
by
itself
and
divest
it
of
some
of
these
other
influences,
granted
that
this
was
the
same
commission
under
which
the
raley,
stern,
and
brown
cases,
the
preceding
case
arose.
granted,
it
is
the
same
ohio
statute
which
is
here
under
consideration,
but
it
is
the
conduct
of
this
appellant,
anna
morgan
that
this
court
must
pass
on
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
the
same
statute
creating
the
un-american
activities
commission,
mr.
justice,
but
not
the
same
statute
under
which
the
indictment
was
returned.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
in
my
opinion,
sir,
it
is.
she
was
indicted
only
for
a
contempt
and
because
of
what
i
am
going
to
point
out
in
the
next
two
or
three
minutes,
i
think
the
court
will
see
why
i
at
least
believe
this
is
a
true
contempt
case.
because
of
certain
questions
asked
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
want
to
detail
a
little
bit
for
this
court
the
conduct
of
this
particular
witness.
this
is
not
raley,
brown,
and
stern
who
came
in
and
answered
questions
and
then,
when
certain
types
of
questions
were
read,
then
and
there
declined
to
answer.
this
is
not
the
case
of
watkins
and
sweezy
whom
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
and
the
majority
of
the
court
said
was
not
a
case
of
a
truculent
or
contumacious
witness
who
refuses
to
answer
all
questions.
this
is
the
very
case
here
which
the
majority
in
the
watkins
and
sweezy
cases
said
that
the
watkins
and
sweezy
cases
were
not.
when
called
before
this
commission,
this
witness
in
case
number
463,
anna
morgan,
came
armed
with
a
prepared
statement.
the
commission
opened
its
testimony
as
far
as
she
was
concerned.she
was
called
to
the
stand
and
the
first
thing
that
was
done
was
she
handed
them
the
statement
which
appears
on
pages
57
to
59
of
the
record.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
characterized
that
statement
as
highly
abusive
and
betrayal,
and
i
would
certainly
agree
with
them
100%.
anna
morgan
did
not
even
wait
for
a
single
question
to
be
asked
to
see
what
the
nature
of
the
questions
were
going
to
be,
to
see
whether
the
questions
were
pertinent,
to
see
whether
the
questions
would
be
incriminating.
she
did
not
wait
for
the
first
question
to
be
asked,
she
presented
her
prepared
statement
which
said
in
the
last
paragraph,
they
are
thereof,
“i
must
remain
silent
before
this
committee.”
and
when
--
after
stating
her
name,
that's
exactly
what
she
did.
from
then
on,
regardless
of
what
question
was
asked
to
her,
whether
it
was
a
question
pertinent
or
not,
i'm
not
passing
on
pertinency
at
this
point.
pertinent
or
not,
whether
or
not
it
was
a
preliminary
question
or
not,
whether
or
not
it
was
or
could
have
been
a
self-incriminating
question,
she
refused
to
answer
each
and
every
question
of
the
commission
which
was
only
carrying
out
the
--
the
intent
which
she
had
already
announced
she
would
do.
after
stating
her
name,
she
refused
to
answer
each
and
every
question
citing
as
her
reason
therefore,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
the
fifth
amendment.
a
reading
of
the
record
in
the
morgan
case
will
clearly
show
that
a
more
contumacious
witness
can
hardly
be
imagined.
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
when
he
said
earlier
the
fact
we
knew.
that
a
witness
cannot
just
pull
down
the
shade
and
say,
“i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
question,
whatsoever.”
now,
that
is
what
she
did.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
and
that
is
the
basis
she
used.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
earl
w.
allison
mrs.
morgan
did
not
leave
the
commission
hearing.
i
do
not
believe
to
prepare
the
statement
between
the
time
that
mr.
terrell
(ph)
testified
and
the
time
of
her
own
testimony.
she
came
prepared
with
the
statement
that
she
was
going
to
remain
silent.
she
came
into
the
hearing
when
she
first
arrived
there
with
that
statement
and
i
think
that
she
had
already
made
up
her
mind
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
that
point
in
just
a
moment.
she
had
already
made
up
her
mind
that
she
was
going
to
refuse
each,
every,
any,
and
all
questions.
she
had
charted
her
own
course
of
conduct
before
she
ever
came
into
that
committee
room
and
i
don't
think
that
anything
she
heard
there
or
anything
that
was
said
to
her
by
the
commission
or
the
chairman
or
anyone
else
had
the
slightest
effect
on
the
course
of
conduct
which
she
had
already
charted
and
began
to
carry
out.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
if
the
court
please,
i
may
have
at
some
time
in
the
past
read
the
record
of
the
questions
asked
of
mr.
terrell
(ph).
i
do
not
at
this
moment
recall
them
and
they
are
not
--
i
do
not
believe
the
part
of
this
record.
i
know
that
there
was
a
previous
witness,
not
the
one
immediately
previous,
not
mr.
terrell
(ph)
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
but
a
mr.
delong
who
had
testified
about
certain
things
concerning
mrs.
morgan.
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
would
have
to
say
that
some
of
the
questions
which
she
was
asked
may
have
been
self-incriminatory
without
any
other
factors
being
considered
at
this
moment.
in
other
words,
forgetting
for
the
moment
any
argument
on
immunity
and
things
like
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
certain
questions,
i
would
have
to
agree.
it
would
--
could
be
considered
as
having
been
self-incriminatory.
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
question
such
as
this,
“are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?”
in
and
of
itself,
self-incriminatory.
under
any
circumstances,
unless
you
were
a
person
were
illegally
within
this
country,
can
that
question
be
self-incriminatory.
how
can
a
person
invoke
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
the
question
“are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?”
i
think
that
that
--
that
particular
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
a
very
--
pointed
specific
example
of
the
course
of
conduct
which
this
woman
was
following.
even
to
that
--
even
to
that
question,
her
answer
was,
“i
refuse
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
the
fifth
amendment,”
to
the
question,
“are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?”
i
don't
think
it
would
have
made
the
slightest
bit
of
difference
what
question
she
would
have
been
asked.
i
think
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
she
was
going
to
sit
there
and
willfully,
deliberately,
contumaciously
and
contemptuously
express
her
scorn
for
the
committee
and
refuse
to
answer
each
and
every
question
that
was
propounded
by
her,
whether
they
were
self-incriminating
or
not.
she
used
as
her
ground
in
each
instance,
never
the
ground
of
pertinency,
never
the
ground
of
--
of
first
amendment,
but
always
in
every
instance,
the
ground
that
she
refused
to
answer
because
her
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
her.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
most
of
the
questions
asked
of
her
did
refer
to
her
relationship
with
the
communist
party
with
the
exception,
and
i
refer
you
to
the
bottom
of
page
54
and
page
--
and
the
top
of
page
55
of
the
record
in
463,
where
at
the
very
bottom
line.
question,
“mrs.
morgan,
have
you
ever
been
employed
by
the
american
zinc
oxide
company?"
answer,
“i
refuse
to
answer
under
the
fifth
amendment."
question,
“it
--
isn't
it
a
fact,
mrs.
morgan,
that
you
were
arrested
under
the
name
of
catherine
o'rourke
for
illegal
picketing
during
a
strike
at
the
asl
plant
which
should
have
been
as
your
plant?"
those
had
to
do
with
past
employment.
in
most
of
the
other
instances,
i
readily
concede
and
very
quickly
concede
that
with
--
with
the
exception
of
the
preliminary
questions
and
the
question
as
to
her
citizenship,
most
of
the
other
questions
did
pertain
to
her
alleged
communist
activities.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
that
is
one
part
of
the
argument,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
in
that
regard,
i
think
it
is
highly
significant.
i
would
like
to
read
a
very
short
passage
from
the
case
of
united
states
versus
josephson
in
165
f.
2d
82.
i
did
not
cite
this
case
to
the
court
because
it
is
an
expression
of
the
opinion
of
this
court,
although
this
court,
the
supreme
court
did
deny
certiorari
in
this
case
at
333
u.s.
838
i
believe
is
the
page
citation.
but
i
--
i
use
this
because
to
my
way
of
thinking,
this
is
the
most
logical
explanation
of
our
own
situation
in
the
morgan
case
which
i
have
come
across.
i
--
the
--
the
logic
in
the
common
sense
reasoning
of
the
court
in
the
josephson
case
commends
itself
to
me
and
i
hope
to
this
court.
it
is
obvious
--
it
is
obvious
that
the
unqualified
refusing,
then
and
there
to
testify
was
tantamount
toward
a
refusal
to
answer
any
questions
at
all
relating
to
the
matter
being
investigated.
after
what
had
transpired
as
shown
above,
the
propounding
of
one
or
more
specific
questions
would
have
been
both
futile
and
time
wasting
and
appellants
renewed
or
repute
--
repeated
refusal
to
answer
them
would
have
added
nothing.
he
had
made
it
crystal
clear
that
he
was
determined
not
to
answer
any
question
concerning
the
subject
matter
under
investigation.
any
argument
to
the
effect
that
it
was
not
shown
that
he
refused
to
reply
to
any
such
questions
can
only
be
regarded
therefore
as
wholly
specious.
the
prosecution
met
then
the
requirements
of
sinclair
versus
united
states
supra
that
it
plead
and
showed
that
the
question
pertained
to
some
matter
under
investigation.
and
at
page
87,
"by
refusing
to
testify
at
all,
he
refused
to
answer
any
questions
that
were
pertinent
as
well
as
those
that
were
not
and
thus,
he
was
not
put
to
the
decision."
he
argues,
could
not
have
been
made
namely
whether
or
not
any
particular
question
was
pertinent.
i
think
that
that
passage
of
the
court
of
appeals
follows
very
much
in
line
with
the
argument
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case.
that
pertinency
here
is
really
not
an
issue
because
she
was
going
to
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
whatsoever,
whether
or
not
pertinency
is
shown.
that
direction
to
answer
would
have
been
futile
because
a
direction
to
answer
would
have
only
brought
forth
the
exact
same
reply
that
she
gave
time
after
time.
it
is
on
that
position
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
hinged
its
opinion
after
a
consideration
of
this
case
on
four
separate
occasions,
and
i
think
to
my
way
of
thinking
at
least,
i
think
a
reading
of
this
record
will
clearly
show
that
that
is
exactly
what
this
witness,
this
appellant
was
going
to
do,
announced
she
was
going
to
do
and
in
fact,
did
do.
now,
if
that
is
not
contempt,
then
i
for
one
do
not
know
what
contempt
would
be.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
the
specific
counts
of
contempt.
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
contempt
to
the
legislative
committee.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
well
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
--
i
can
only
say,
sir,
that
her
overall
contumacious
attitude
is
certainly
reflected
in
her
answer
to
each
and
every
specific
question
that
she
in
fact
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
pardon
me
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
there
were
three
dissents
in
this
case
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
as
the
court
may
be
well
aware,
and
if
i
may
for
a
moment
look
here.judge
stuart's
dissent,
of
course
points
out
the
majority
argument
that
because
of
the
immunity
factor,
the
--
the
defendant
or
the
appellant
here
was
deprived
of
her
privilege.
and
he
then
goes
on
and
refer
specifically
to
chairman
renner's
statement
which
i
presume
as
to
what
your
specific
question
is
directed,
and
i
can
only
say
this.
chairman
renner
made
that
statement
after
the
first
12
questions
had
already
been
propounded.
if
--
if
this
appellant
were
not
contumacious
in
the
first
11
questions
or
first
12
questions,
then
she
was
not
contumacious
at
all.
and
i
therefore
say
that
chairman
renner
stated
while
it
--
i
--
i
do
not
apologize
for
the
statement.
i
don't
try
to
explain
in
a
way
he
made
it.
he
misstated
the
law
as
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
said
he
misstated
the
law
and
i
was
coming
to
that
just
a
moment
because
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
yesterday.
but,
his
statement
came
during
the
course
of
a
conduct
which
had
already
been
clearly
defined
by
that
appellant
herself
without
the
slightest
bit
of
misleading
by
that
commission
or
by
chairman
renner.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
count
of
the
indictment
in
this
particular
case
on
each
of
the
37
questions
which
was
asked
this
witness.
five
of
those
counts
were
dismissed
upon
trial
on
the
ground
that
they
were
repetitious
of
other
counts
and
one
or
two
on
another
ground.
but
basically
speaking,
there
is
a
count
in
the
indictment
in
this
particular
case
on
each
of
the
questions
propounded
to
her
because
she
refused
to
answer
each
and
every
question.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
not
because
she
came
to
the
hearing
with
an
attitude,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
of
course
not
say
that.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
let
me
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
if
i
may.
i
feel
that
this
court
in
deciding
this
particular
case
and
the
questions
presented
therein
must
look
at
this
case
as
a
hope.
her
attitude
is
a
clear
indication
of
what
she
intended
to
do.
her
actions,
she
was
not
indicted
here
for
contempt
because
of
her
attitude,
she
was
indicted
for
contempt
because
of
her
actions.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
her
attitude
is
a
clear
sign
of
what
she
was
doing
when
she
did
what
she
did.
she
had
already
made
up
her
mind
she
was
not
going
to
answer.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
that's
attitude.
now
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
but
when
she
did
not
answer,
i
then
raised
this
question.
did
she
not
answer
because
of
the
attitude
she
had
previously
determined
in
her
own
mind
or
did
she
not
answer
because
of
some
of
the
grounds,
which
have
since
been
raised
during
the
subsequent
appeals
of
this
case
like
pertinency,
direction
to
answer
and
so
forth?
mr.
earl
w.
allison
nothing
was
further
from
her
mind
at
that
time
of
that
hearing
as
i
see
the
record
than
the
question
of
pertinency.
now,
we
are
faced
with
the
question.
“did
she
refuse
to
answer
because
she
had
deliberately
made
up
her
mind
she
was
going
to
be
contumacious,
or
did
she
refuse
to
answer
because
the
questions
were
not
pertinent?”
i
say
clearly
it
is
the
former.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
attempt
to
answer
you
this
way.
point
number
one.
clearly,
when
the
witness
came
into
the
hearing
room,
there
was
either
one
of
two
things,
either
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
i
am
not
arguing
the
supreme
court
has
disposed
of
the
question
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment,
we
argued
that
out.
i'm
not
going
into
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
said
that
whatever
privilege
she
had,
be
it
fifth
amendment
or
article
1
section
10
of
the
ohio
constitution,
she
claimed
it.
and
i
will
--
i
will
agree
with
that
100%.
she
sought
to
and
did
invoke
a
privilege,
if
in
fact
a
privilege
was
available
to
her.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
now,
we
maintain
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
preceding
case
that
when
she
also
appeared
before
that
legislative
committee,
she
was
bathed
with
immunity
by
the
very
virtue
of
the
statute
of
the
state
of
ohio
itself.
and
let
me
point
out
that
the
state
statute
on
immunity
in
ohio
gives
to
a
witness
before
a
legislative
committee
even
more
protection,
even
more
protection
than
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
for
this
reason.
i'll
use
an
example.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
see.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
in
other
words,
as
a
bare
--
as
a
bare
privilege
question.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
shorn
of
the
immunity
factors?
mr.
earl
w.
allison
no,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
she
would
have
--
she
came
--
would
have
come
into
that
committee
room
cloaked
in
her
privilege
against
self-incrimination
whether
it
be
under
the
united
states
constitution
or
the
ohio
constitution.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
--
i
--
perhaps,
got
off
on
my
own
interpretation
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
of
what
your
question
was.
now,
there
is
something
which
i
feel
and
i
feel
very
definite
must
be
said
in
this
case.
i
make
no
claim
to
being
a
learner
than
scholarly
constitutional
lawyer.
there
are
attorneys
who
devote
a
lifetime
to
studying
constitutional
law.
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
devote
to
that.
but
with
the
legal
training
and
experience
which
i
have,
coupled
with
what
i
hope
at
least
is
a
normal
amount
of
common
sense
and
logic.
i
think
this
case
presents
four
constitutional
questions,
either
--
or
four
constitutional
amendments
to
be
considered,
either
directly
or
collaterally.
the
first
is
the
fifth
amendment
which
we
have
just
been
discussing.
i'm
not
going
to
cite
the
cases
with
which
the
court
is
far
more
familiar
than
i
am.
the
--
the
series
of
cases
which
have
laid
down
the
principle
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
available
in
a
state
proceeding.
as
i
have
said,
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
disposed
of
that
question,
as
held
that
the
privilege
was
invoked
if
any
privilege
in
fact
existent.
appellant
has
again
here
raised
the
double
sovereignty
question,
and
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
question
because
this
court
again
is
far
more
familiar
with
the
arguments
in
the
cases
on
that
subject
that
i
am.
i
am
merely
going
to
say
that
in
as
much
as
under
the
ohio
statute,
the
--
the
immunity
statute,
this
appellant
was
far
more
protected
than
she
would
have
been
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
think
we
no
longer
have
the
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
this
case.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
under
the
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
ohio
constitutional
provision
does
apply.
and
as
decided
by
the
ohio
court,
this
witness
had
a
greater
immunity
than
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
the
ohio
constitution
would
have
given
her.
i
just
don't
think
we
any
longer
have
a
fifth
amendment
question
for
this
court
to
determine.now,
the
next
amendment
which
has
been
raised
in
this
case
is
the
first
amendment
for
the
united
states
constitution.
again,
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
which
hold
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
shorthand
for
the
first
date.
i
grant
there
are
cases,
some
of
them
recently
decided,
i
am
fully
aware
of
those
which
hold
that
even
though
the
fourteenth
is
not
shorthand
for
the
first
date.
there
are
certain
inherent
first
amendment
rights
incorporated
within
our
concept
with
due
process
of
law.
and
with
that
holding
i
would
not
quarrel,
but
i
say
this,
“in
the
very
conduct
of
human
affairs,
i
don't
care
where
it
is,
when
it
is,
or
what
it's
about.”
everything
that
we
do
everyday
of
our
life
in
someway
touches
of
what
our
first
amendment
rights.
and
i
say
that
if
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
is
to
be
interpreted
to
preclude
any
punishment
or
anything
which
in
any
way
touches
upon
those
first
amendment
rights,
then
i
am
afraid
that
we
had
to
better
take
another
look
at
all
of
our
penal
laws,
all
of
our
criminal
laws.
the
very
law
of
assault
in
ohio
at
least,
there
can
be
assault
by
virtue
of
words,
a
mere
threat.
if
we
are
to
say,
“you
cannot
convict
me
of
assault
because
i
have
freedom
of
speech
to
say
i
am
going
to
kill
you,”
then
i
think
we
have
gone
too
far.
and
in
this
case,
certainly,
these
questions
in
the
very
conduct
or
the
very
nature
of
the
course
of
human
affairs
touched
upon
first
amendment
rights,
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
press,
freedom
of
assembly.
but
i
say
that
there
is
a
point,
there
must
be
a
point
at
which
these
things
can
no
longer
transcend
the
rights
of
some
governmental
control.
now,
it
is
my
understanding
that
--
and
this
is
--
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
at
page
11.
this
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
schweitzer
case,
in
the
sweezy
case,
that
this
court's
review
is
limited,
to
a
review
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
at
least,
that
as
i
say,
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
before
this
court.
now,
it
is
the
conduct
that
the
hearing
of
this
witness,
it
is
the
commission
of
the
crime
which
he
actually
committed,
a
misdemeanor,
certainly
a
contempt.
as
the
only
thing
she
is
indicted
for
is
a
contempt.
but
what
she
is
indicted
for
occurred
at
the
hearing,
and
i
think
we
here
become
confronted
with
a
serious
question.
i
ask
this
question.
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
concept
of
due
process
of
law
apply
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
itself.
clearly,
in
the
case
of
any
crime,
it
applies
starting
with
perhaps
the
arrest,
the
indictment
through
the
trial
and
so
forth.
a
person
is
guaranteed
due
process
of
law.
but
here,
the
appellant
is
attempting
to
apply
their
concept
of
due
process
of
law
to
her
own
commission
of
the
crime.
the
crime
occurred
at
the
hearing.
that's
where
the
crime
occurred.
in
no
other
case
which
i
can
conceivably
think
of
is
the
perpetrator
of
a
crime
guaranteed
due
process
of
law
during
the
perpetration
of
his
crime.
i
think
there
--
there
has
been
no
claim
of
denial
in
this
case
of
due
process,
at
any
step
subsequent
to
the
hearing.
it
was
her
conduct
at
the
hearing
for
which
she
was
indicted.
it
was
therefore
her
conduct
that
the
hearing
which
was
the
crime
which
was
committed.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
no,
i
--
i
say
only,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
and
i
think
we're
here
at
a
--
we're
--
we're
here
at
a
--
at
a
question,
a
question
as
to
how
far
the
protection
of
the
concept
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
goes.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
during
the
time
the
crime
was
being
perpetrated,
yes.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
but,
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
only
raised
the
question,
sir,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
due
process
clause
does
go
clear
back
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
to
the
hearing.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
said
that
this
question
then
arises
in
my
mind,
a
--
a
query
type
of
thing.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
would
presume
that
as
transfer.
i
would
--
i
would
presume
that
as
true.
well,
i
--
i
know
it's
true.
there
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
this
court
has
in
fact
reversed
many
--
many
statutes.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
back
to
the
court
proceedings.
i
think
that
this
case
is,
however
--
i
think
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
attempting
to
enlarge
the
questions
before
this
court,
far
beyond
the
questions
which
are
actually
before
this
court,
if
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
correct.
perhaps,
by
invoking
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
to
my
way
of
thinking
is
the
only
actual
constitutional
amendment
before
this
court
in
this
case.
perhaps
by
invoking
the
fourteenth
amendment,
appellant
can
raise
all
of
these
other
questions.
that
is
as
i
say
is
a
--
a
constitutional
question
which
this
court
certainly
is
going
to
have
to
decide
in
the
instant
case
as
to
whether
or
not
in
this
particular
case
under
the
invocation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
now,
this
court
can
go
back
and
review
all
of
these
various
questions
which
appellant
said
is
--
are
before
the
court.
i
do
not
say
they
are
not
before
the
court.
i
--
humble
opinion,
some
of
them
are
not.
some
of
them
have
clearly
been
decided
by
the
state
of
ohio,
under
the
ohio
statutes
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
in
my
understanding
of
constitutional
law,
there
are
some
areas
in
at
least
in
which
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
will
not
be
reviewed
by
this
court
involving
decisions,
involving
the
interpretation
of
state
statutes
and
i
think
that
in
and
of
itself,
knocked
out
five
of
six
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
appellant
in
the
instant
case.
and
i
would
as
an
example
of
--
of
what
i
am
referring
to,
the
appellant
raises
the
argument
ones
again
which
has
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
this
was
in
fact
the
law,
a
legislative.
the
--
the
commission
was
a
legislative
committee
to
which
the
immunity
statute
did
apply.
now,
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
commission,
under
the
laws
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
ohio
is
such
a
committee,
is
a
question
for
the
ohio
of
course
to
decide
and
not
a
question
which
comes
before
this
court.
that
type
of
--
that
type
of
question,
i
think
that
the
ohio
decision
has
already
knocked
out.
now,
perhaps
let
me
say
this.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
in
my
own
opinion,
sir,
it
does
not.
it
is
not
such
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
--
i
--
well,
yes.
yes,
sir.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
well,
yes.
i
--
i
do
say
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
say
that
her
--
her
clearly
expressed
attitude
of
--
of
going
there
and
going
to
be
contemptuous
is
a
--
is
an
answer
to
what
mr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
to
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
oh,
yes.
in
other
words,
her
--
her
expressed
attitude
and
then
the
following
through
of
that
attitude
goes
clearly
to
the
point
as
to
whether
or
not
she
was
mislead
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
in
anyway
by
the
commission.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes.
i'm
not
--
i'm
no
t
going
to
deny
her
--
her
privilege
of
self-incrimination
or
i'm
not
going
to
remove
her
from
the
immunity
bathe
or
anything
else
merely
because
she
comes
here
with
a
prepared
statement
and
an
attitude
like
this.
but,
neither
am
i
going
to
stand
here
and
admit
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
witness
was
a
little
red
riding
hood
in
all
innocence
while
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
was
a
big
bad
wolf
waiting
to
gobble
her
up.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
there
had
been
interrogation
of
fire
what
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
no,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
is
for
some
confusion
creeps
in.
i
cannot
positively
answer
your
question,
but
i
will
attempt
to
clarify
at
least
this
much.
there
have
been
references
in
this
case
and
in
this
argument
to
--
to
prior
witnesses.
one
witness,
a
mr.
delong
definitely
did
testify
regarding
mrs.
morgan's
activities.
to
my
knowledge
at
least,
mrs.
morgan
was
not
sitting
there
during
his
testimony
which
had
occurred
some
month
or
so
previously.
immediately
prior
to
her
appearance,
a
mr.
terrell
(ph)
had
testified.
now,
whether
or
not
mr.
terrell
(ph)
testified
on
anything
as
to
mrs.
morgan's
activities,
i
do
not
recall
because
it
has
been
some
seven
years
since
i
read
through
that.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
she
was
there
while
mr.
terrell
(ph)
testified,
but
i
don't
know
whether
he
testified
as
to
anything
involving
mrs.
morgan.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
no,
mr.
justice.
i
believe
that
is
the
witness,
delong
that
is
--
that
--
that
we
are
talking
about
at
that
point.
well,
from
what
page
are
you
reading
there
now?
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
well,
may
i
attempt
to
clarify
it,
sir?
mr.
earl
w.
allison
on
page
60,
if
you
will
turn
to
the
--
about
the
middle
of
page
60,
you
will
find
the
following
question."
and
do
you
recall
of
your
knowledge
whether
mr.
delong
mentioned
anna
morgan
at
anytime
during
his
testimony?"
now,
that
was
a
question
propounded
to
the
court
reporter
who
had
taken
the
testimony
of
mr.
delong.
then,
there
are
these
questions
concerning
mrs.
morgan
which
had
in
fact
been
propounded
to
mr.
delong.
then,
at
the
top
of
page
62,
"you
find
a
date
there,
april
1st,
1952,
is
that
a
correct?"
answer,
"yes."
question,
“and
do
you
know
of
your
own
knowledge
whether
mrs.
morgan
was
present
throughout
that
hearing
or
at
least
was
she
present
during
the
testimony
of
the
witness
who
preceded
her
on
that
day?”
that
refers
not
to
mr.
delong
who
was
discussed
on
pages
60
and
61,
but
to
mr.
terrell
(ph)
who
had
immediately
preceded
her
as
a
witness.
there
is
a
change
over
there
in
the
--
in
the
questioning
of
the
court
reporter
between
the
delong
testimony
and
the
terrell
(ph)
testimony.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
with
the
exception
of
answering
her
name.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
am
perhaps,
sir
--
perhaps
this
court
in
its
wisdom
and
then
its
much
longer
experience
in
both
the
field
of
law
as
well
as
the
judicial
field
as
compared
to
myself.
perhaps
i
placed
too
much
emphasis
on
the
clearly
contemptuous,
abusive,
vitriolic
statement
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
prepared
statement
which
she
came
there
with.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
she
was
not
indicted
for
that,
but
i
think
it
clearly
shows
her
attitude.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
it
considered
it
as
a
factor
in
--
sir,
in
determining
her
contumacious
conduct.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
if
i
may
look
for
one
moment.
at
page
124,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
second
full
paragraph.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
said,
“the
state
advances
the
theory
and
so
forth,”
and
then
the
second
sentence
of
that
paragraph.
“in
the
light
of
what
we
have
said
however
concerning
the
necessity
of
a
direction
to
answer,
it
is
neither
to
necessary
to
consider
this
premise.”
that
is
the
premise
advanced
by
the
state
of
ohio,
“nor
to
give
such
statement
which
is
highly
abusive
and
vitriolic,
dignity
of
perpetuation
in
this
opinion.
they
did
not
--
they
did
not
go
on
into
the
statement
itself,
but
earlier
in
the
record
they
had
referred
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
they
read
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
no,
they
did
not
rest
their
decision
on
that
statement.
no,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
we
advanced
the
theory
there,
sir,
as
we
have
advanced
it
here.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
but
the
statement
is
a
--
mr.
earl
w.
allison
--
a
part
of
the
whole
picture
that
you
cannot
look.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
i
am
under
the
impression,
sir,
and
i
--
i
will
have
to
--
i
will
have
to
first
say,
“yes,
sir.
it
appears
to
have
rejected
it.”
i
am
under
the
impression
that
somewhere
in
the
ohio
supreme
court's
opinion,
there
is
another
reference
to
that
statement
which
merely
is
for
the
same
purpose
that
i
have
referred
to
adhere
and
that
is
to
show
the
overall
attitude.
i
--
i
feel
sure
that
in
that
decision,
there
is
another
reference,
i
seem
to
recall
it.
but
i
--
i
cannot
find
it
at
the
moment
and
since
i
have
only
about
two
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
look.
i
--
i
think
that
there
is
one
thing
further
that
i
would
like
to
say
to
this
court
and
it
is
one
which,
perhaps
in
these
other
cases,
a
question
has
been
raised
and
not
been
discussed
in
the
decision,
i
do
not
know.
if
it
has
been
raised
and
rejected,
then
i
presume
it
will
once
again
be
rejected.
but
i
feel
very
clearly
that
we
have
one
other
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
i
have
not
discussed,
which
has
some
application
to
the
instant
case.
i
feel
very
clearly
and
very
strong.
well,
i
am
not
standing
here
advocating
state's
rights
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
i
feel
that
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
cannot
be
overlooked.
it
has
been
charged
in
this
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
ohio
has
no
power
to
do
this,
no
power
to
do
that,
no
power
to
do
anything
else.
i
say
that
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
ohio
did
have
power
to
do
certain
things
unless
someone
can
point
the
way
toward
an
absolute
prohibition
against
that
power
in
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states'
tenth
amendment
reserves
to
the
states
those
powers
not
expressly
granted
to
the
united
states
government
or
expressly
prohibited
by
the
constitution
to
the
states.
nowhere
have
i
seen
in
any
of
the
cases
which
have
been
decided,
which
made
me
feel
that
perhaps
the
question
has
not
been
raised,
any
reference
to
the
tenth
amendment
and
as
to
any
possible
power
of
the
state
of
ohio
to
inquire
into
affairs
which
i
respectfully
submit
were
entirely
within
the
province
of
the
state
of
ohio.
we
did
pass.
it
has
been
argued
here
there
was
no
legislative
purpose
to
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission.
i
submit
the
state
of
ohio
did
pass
legislation
as
a
result
of
the
hearings
and
inquiries
which
that
commission
held.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
you
mean
as
to
chairman
renner's
statement?
mr.
earl
w.
allison
yes,
sir.
the
majority
very
clearly
discussed
it.
mr.
earl
w.
allison
and
rejected
judge
stewart's
thinking
on
the
question
at
page
--
at
page
123
of
the
record
where
the
majority
said
it
is
argued
also
that
the
chairman
of
the
commission
in
someway
contributed
to
appellant's
misfortune
by
stating
to
her,
“mrs.
morgan,
i
should
like
to
advice
you
under
the
fifth
amendment”
and
so
forth.
and
then,
the
ohio
supreme
court
concluded
as
i
have
argued
here
that
that
did
not
mislead
her
in
anyway
that
it
did
not
influence
her
in
anyway
in
her
course
of
conduct.
she
had
already
charted
that
course
of
conduct.
i
believe
the
instant
case,
perhaps
is
a
case
in
which
we
are
more
closer
or
closer
to
an
actual
contumacious
witness
case.
i
think
the
record
will
bare
me
out
in
that
regard
in
any
of
the
cases,
any
of
the
decisions
which
i
have
read.
other
cases
which
have
been
decided,
the
majority
opinions
have
said
they
were
not
the
contumacious
type
of
witness.
i
submit
in
the
instant
case,
this
was
a
contumacious
witness.
i
submit
that
ohio
had
power
to
punish
that
contempt
if
it
occurred.
i
submit
the
contempt
did
occur,
and
i
submit
that
the
punishment
which
amounted
here
to
a
fine
of
$500
was
fully
proper
and
that
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
which
has
been
made
under
its
interpretation
of
ohio's
constitution
and
statutes
should
be
affirmed.
