ms.
thelma
c.
furry
if
the
court
please.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
for
the
second
time.
in
june
of
1957,
this
court
vacated
the
conviction
in
this
matter
and
remanded
it
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
watkins
and
sweezy
decisions.
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
reconsider
and
adhered
to
its
original
decision.
the
first
remark
i
want
to
make
to
this
court
is
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
ruled
on
the
validity
and
scope
of
the
ohio
immunity
act
relative
to
testimony
before
a
legislative
committee
although
there
has
been
an
immunity
act
in
ohio
since
approximately
1872.
i
want
to
also
point
out
to
this
court,
that
this
is
the
first
case
involving
contempt
of
a
state
legislative
committee
in
which
an
immunity
statute
has
been
involved
that
this
court
has
considered
all
other
cases
that
this
court
has
considered
involving
immunity
statute
has
involved
grand
jury.
and
we
all
know
the
grand
jury
sessions
are
held
in
secret
so
that
the
testimony
given
there
is
not
available
to
the
public
or
to
any
other
persons
or
agencies.
you
must
remember
that
this
year
was
1952,
this
was
the
year
that
mrs.morgan
was
called
before
this
commission.
she
was
the
second
unwilling
witness
called
before
the
commission
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
first
and
--
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
she
appeared
without
counsel.
mrs.
morgan
was
not
represented
before
this
commission
with
counsel.
mrs.
morgan
was
present
during
the
testimony
of
the
first
witness,
mr.
(inaudible),
who
also
appeared
without
counsel.
this
is
set
forth
as
a
matter
of
record
in
the
record
at
page
62,
the
fact
that
she
was
present
during
the
testimony
in
the
questioning
of
mr.
terrell
(ph).
at
the
conclusion
of
mr.
terrell
(ph)
testimony
in
questioning,
mr.
renner,
counsel
for
the
commission,
made
this
statement.
at
page
11
of
--
of
our
brief,
mr.
renner
said,
”mr.
terrell
(ph),
you
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer
any
question,
the
answer
to
which
might
incriminate
--
incriminate
you.
otherwise,
you
are
required
under
the
law
to
answer
the
questions
that
are
put
to
you
by
this
commission,"
which
is
a
commission
constituted
by
the
people
of
ohio
to
make
a
city
of
communism
and
un-american
activities
in
ohio.
that
is
also
in
the
record
of
page
62
as
part
of
the
record
the
statement
made
by
this,
mr.
renner.
the
commission
commenced
questioning
this
appellant,
mrs.morgan,
without
making
any
preliminary
statements
as
to
the
scope
of
its
authority,
its
--
the
pertinencies
of
questions
to
be
asked
are
any
--
anyway
identifying
its
--
its
power.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
on
the
--
i
believe
it
was
the
morning
session.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
she
was
present
at
the
hearing
and
the
record
so
shows
that
she
was
present.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
in
--
at
page
62
of
the
record
if
the
court
wants
to
verify
that.
the
second
question
after
mrs.morgan
was
sworn,
she
gave
her
name.
the
second
question
put
to
here
was,
“and
where
do
you
reside,
mrs.morgan?”
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
her
answer
was,
“i
regret
that
i
cannot
answer
your
question
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
because
to
do
so
would
give
your
committee
an
opportunity
to
incriminate
me.”
now,
prior
to
the
time
that
this
witness
was
called,
on
march
the
31st
of
952
--
i'm
looking
at
page
10
of
my
brief,
at
the
second
paragraph,
stated.
there
were
hearing
held
by
this
commission
by
the
way,
a
secrete
session
that
were
not
open
to
the
public
and
which
cooperating
witnesses
testified.
april
the
1st,
1952
was
the
first
public
hearing,
where
--
where
these
--
where
mrs.morgan
appeared
as
an
uncooperating
witness.
the
records
will
show
that
on
march
the
31st
of
1952,
when
the
hearings
were
held
in
columbus,
a
person
by
the
name
of
john
delong
testified
at
length.
he
described
his
relationship
with
the
appellant,
anna
morgan,
told
where
she
lived,
stated
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
active
in
its
organizational
work.
this
had
been
carried
in
the
news.
this
is
also
in
the
record
at
pages
1662.
this
testimony
of
the
delong
had
been
in
the
newspapers
and
mrs.morgan
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
she
--
that
he
had
testified
about
her,
her
activities
and
her
address.
oh,
i
am
corrected
by
counsel
by
saying
that
mr.
delong
testified
at
a
open
hearing,
it
was
not
a
closed
hearing
so
that
is
why
she
was
aware
of
everything
that
he
had
to
say.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
yes.
i
think,
that
the
record
will
disclose
if
this
delong
testified
and
--
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
oh,
yes.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
an
open
hearing.
this
witness
had
testified
about
meeting
that
mrs.morgan's
home
etcetera.
at
the
beginning
of
this
session
of
mrs.morgan's,
she
presented
a
prepared
statement
to
the
commission
in
which
she
stated
the
following.
at
page
57
in
the
record,
mrs.
morgan
said
this
--
about
the
middle
of
the
page
of
57,
she
said,
“this
committee
was
paid
to
investigate
so-called
un-american
and
subversive
activities,
but
in
all
these
months,
it
has
fail
to
state
what
it
considers
un-american
or
subversive.”
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
she
goes
on
and
she
says,
“who
am
i,
you
may
ask?”
she
answers
with
her
statement,
“i
am
just
an
average
american
house
wife.”
and
closes
that
paragraph
by
saying,
“i
now,
present
my
sincere
beliefs,
and
let
this
committee
and
all
interested
citizens
who
pay
this
committee
judge
me.”
then
she
proceeds
with
her
statement
over
to
page
59
at
this
time
which
i
want
to
read
her
closing
paragraph,
“because
this
committee
conducts
its
hearings
like
an
inquisition
with
no
rules
of
evidence
that
victims
are
denied
the
rights
which
they
would
have
in
a
dully
constituted
court.
therefore,
i
must
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
remain
silent
before
this
committee.”
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
perhaps,
i
think
she
did
quite
well
for
herself.
she
continue
to
just
--
to
decline
to
answer
the
questions
of
the
commission
and
when
she
get
about
halfway
through
the
questioning,
mr.--
on
page
4
or
page
13
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
what
mr.--
the
chairman,
mr.
renner
said
to
her.
he
said,
“mrs.
morgan,
i
should
like
to
advice
you
under
the
fifth
amendment,
you
are
permitted
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
you.”
mrs.
morgan
said,
“yes.”
the
chairman
said,
“but
you
are
not
permitted
to
refuse
to
answer
question
--
answer
questions
simply
for
you
own
convenience,
counsel
may
proceed.”
then
following
her
refusal
to
answer
each
question,
counsel
proceeded
to
ask
the
next
question.
mrs.
morgan
was
never
directed
to
answer
any
question.
mrs.
morgan
was
never
offered
any
immunity
for
answers.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
i
want
to
say
to
the
court,
that
is
what
the
prosecutors
had
been
arguing
all
included
the
court
--
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
i
do
not
think
that
is
true.
no,
your
honor
and
our
courts
in
ohio
had
never
said
so
prior
to
this
particular
case.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
the
statute
does
say
that,
your
honor.
we
have
--
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
yes
we
have
it.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
in
our
brief,
it's
at
page
6.
it
was
then
called
general
code
60
at
the
time
of
this
hearing,
it's
now
revised
to
a
different
number
but
that
is
the
precise
language,
the
last
paragraph
on
page
6
of
our
brief.
the
--
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
no.
it
does
not.
ms.
thelma
c.
furry
that's
correct.
now,
our
--
calling
the
court's
attention
to
the
record
commencing
at
the
bottom
of
page
49,
that
is
the
record
of
the
actual
proceedings
before
the
ohio
un-american
commission
of
the
proceedings
with
mrs.morgan.
starting
at
49
through
page
56,
they
have
the
proceedings
of
questions
and
answers
in
their
whole
interrogation.
above
the
middle
of
page
51,
the
type
of
question
start
out,
isn't
it
a
fact
type
of
question
which
indicated
that
this
commission
was
not
trying
to
get
information
but
was
merely,
asking
about
matters
that
they
already
had
and
was
saying,
"isn't
it
a
fact
that
this
is
true?"
doing
this
in
public
open
sessions
where
everyone
could
hear
what
the
answers
were.
at
this
time,
i
want
to
give
my
colleague
an
opportunity
to
further
develop
the
arguments
in
this
matter.
