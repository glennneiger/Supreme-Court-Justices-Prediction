mr.
carl
b.
rubin
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
in
the
time
remaining,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
the
ohio
immunity
statute.
may
i
say
at
the
outset
that
i
believe
the
--
by
a
mistake,
this
court
was
misinformed
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
ohio
statute.
the
distinction
between
committees
and
commissions
in
ohio
is
not
a
very
precise
one.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
particular
question
was
considered
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
in
the
first
branch
of
the
syllabus,
stated
very
specifically
that
this
was
a
select
committee
so
as
to
be
with
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
in
this
regard
that
that
the
ohio
statute
on
immunity
is
not
like
the
federal
statute
where
there
must
be
a
specific
action
taken
before
the
immunity
is
conferred,
where
the
attorney
general
must
be
consulted
in
the
district
court
of
permission
granted.
to
the
contrary,
in
ohio,
the
provision
for
immunity
before
the
legislature
is
a
great
that
you
must
specifically
divest
your
self
up.
you
have
it
until
you
take
action
and
you
must
take
your
action
in
writing.
now,
this
is
similar
of
course
to
the
ohio
law
on
a
jury
trial.
a
person
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
a
jury
trial,
unless
they
specifically
waive
their
right
in
writing,
so
too
is
it
the
immunity
statute.
there
is
no
question
in
the
record
that
at
no
point
or
that
at
any
point
were
these
witnesses
told
of
the
immunity
statute.
but
the
statute
does
exist,
it
did
exist
and
it
did
cover
these
witnesses
as
fully
and
as
completely
as
the
state
of
ohio
could
do
so.
if
these
witnesses
in
fact
do
not
have
immunity,
it
is
not
because
of
the
action
of
the
legislature
of
ohio,
it
is
despite
the
action
of
the
legislature
of
ohio.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
an
important
consideration
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact.
but
getting
back
to
the
record,
and
in
connection
with
the
--
the
discussion
that
has
gone
on
as
to
the
misleading
by
the
chairman
of
these
witnesses.
might
i
point
out
to
the
court
and
i
think
quite
significant,
the
discussion
that
was
held
with
counsel
for
talmadge
raley.
bear
with
me
one
moment.
mr.
burger,
this
is
counsel
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
i'm
sorry,
sir,
page
99.
mr.
burger,
“mr.
chairman,
you
will
forgive
the
witness
for
taking
his
legal
advise
from
me
rather
than
from
the
committee.”
the
witness,
“if
i
recall.”
chairman
renner,
“you
may
advise
your
witness
what
his
rights
are
under
the
constitution.”
mr.
burger,
“i
certainly
will.”
mr.
chairman
renner,
“i
was
not
aware
that
you
would
advise
him
not
to
give
that
answer.”
mr.
burger,
“i
had
not.
i
didn't
advise
and
to
give
any
answer.
i
pointed
out
that
you
were
telling
the
witness
what
the
law
is,
and
with
all
due
respect,
that
is
my
function.
if
he
wants
to
know
the
law,
i
think
it
is
i
he
should
ask
and
not
you.”
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
but
the
--
the
point
that
i
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
but
this
i
submit
is
important
in
the
context
of
whether
or
not
this
chairman
misled
this
particular
witness
who
came
to
this
commission
hearing
with
a
statement
that
he
read,
with
the
council,
with
whom
he
conferred,
and
who
advised
him
specifically
that
it
was
to
him,
the
witness
should
look
for
a
legal
advice
not
to
the
chairman
of
the
commission.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
i'm
saying,
sir
that
the
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
well,
i
--
i
don
t
know
if
i
phrased
it
quite
that
fashion,
i'm
saying
the
ohio
immunity
statute
is
automatic.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
the
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
in
writing.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
i
--
you
lost
me,
sir.
at
the
very
end,
he
cannot
claim
immunity
from
the
statute.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
that
is
correct.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
no,
sir.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
this
court
held
in
sinclair
versus
the
united
states
that
the
witness
is
rightly
bound
to
construe
the
statute.
this
would
mean
as
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
well,
i
--
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
witnesses
knew
very
well
how
to
claim
their
privileges
under
the
immunities
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
--
all
was
there
and
that
this
witness,
accompanied
by
counsel,
if
you
please.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
--
was
in
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
perhaps
so.
i
may
need
my
time
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
i
would
say
not.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
i
submit,
sir,
that
there
is
this
difference.
that
in
hypothetical
instance
that
you
gave
me,
there
is
no
question,
no
specific
question
that
he
refused
to
answer.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
yes.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
well,
may
i
suggest
sir
that
the
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
--
hypothetical
example
has
this
one
variation.
there
is
nothing
again
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
witness
brown
was
told
by
the
commission
or
by
the
chairman
that
he
had
a
right
to
assert
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
that
nothing
further
would
then
be
done.
i
--
i
submit
that
that
is
an
essential
--
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
no,
sir.
i
am
saying
this
and
i
--
i
think
this
one
bit
of
background
is
important.
this
commission
appeared
in
many
different
cities
in
ohio
and
interrogated
some
30
odd
witnesses.
whatever
the
commission's
or
the
chairman's
recollection
of
what
he
thought
he
said.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
is
as
important
as
what
he
actually
said.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
if
he
said
something
in
akron,
ohio
or
in
columbus,
ohio,
that
is
not
part
of
this
case.
it
can
be
assumed
that
he
granted
to
these
witnesses
or
--
or
misled
the
witnesses
into
believing
that
there
would
not
be
prosecution.
now,
i
--
i
believe
that
justice
stewart
fell
into
the
trap
that
justice
brennan
pointed
our
yesterday.
this
is
what
the
chairman
said
he
said.
but
it
is
only
his
recollection,
some
15
months
after
the
fact.
and
i
--
i
submit
that
--
that
this
particular
record
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
case
no
such
statement
by
the
commission.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
no,
sir.
i
--
i
am
saying
that
--
that
whatever
his
--
his
testimony
is
correct
but
it
has
no
bearing
on
these
particular
cases
because
the
--
it
was
not
stated
to
these
witnesses
that
this
may
have
been
--
that's
maybe
correct
in
the
morgan
case
but
it
is
not
correct
in
these
cases.
mr.
carl
b.
rubin
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
