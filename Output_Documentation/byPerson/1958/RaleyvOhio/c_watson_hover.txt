mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
direct
my
remarks
to
certain
portions
of
the
case
for
the
state
reserving
for
discussion
by
my
associate
mr.
rubin,
questions
relating
to
the
relationship
of
these
cases
to
watkins
and
sweezy
and
also
questions
relating
to
the
ohio
immunity
statute.
why
--
mr.

hover
i
would
like
to
deal
with
that,
mr.
--
mr.
c.

justice
(inaudible)
if
i
may.
i
am
reading
from
the
record
where
the
--
the
trial
record
this
is
where
the
chairman
of
the
commission
is
being
crossed-examined
by
defense
counsel.
mr.

court.
defense
counsel
to
the
chairman
of
the
commission,
“you
recognized,
do
you
not,
the
defendants
have
the
right
to
assert
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
connection
with
questions
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
them?
do
you
call
--
recall
that?”
answer,
“it
was
the
policy
of
the
commission
not
to
press
questions
which
we
felt
would
be
of
an
incriminating
nature.
for
instance,
whenever
a
witness
was
asked
a
question,”
i
believe
every
witness
before
the
commission
was
asked
the
question,
“are
you
or
are
you
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
and
so
forth.
and
if
the
witness
refused
to
answer
the
question,
we
did
not
press
it.”
frequently,
i
made
statements
which
indicated
the
policy
of
the
commission
whether
it
was
to
ask
the
witnesses
or
not,
i
do
not
know,
possibly
less
than
that.
the
statement
was,
“we
will
not
require
you
to
answer
questions
which
may
incriminate
yourself
but
we
want
it
clearly
understood
that
you
may
not
refuse
to
answer
questions
on
the
ground
that
it
would
incriminate
someone
else.”
mr.
c.
watson
hover
i'm
reading
from
page
39
to
40
of
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
--
this
record.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
this
is
the
trial
--
yes.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
that
is
correct.
i
find
no
other
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
there
is
no
reference
to
it
in
the
hearing
record
of
which
i
am
immediately
aware
both
from
this
and
from
the
past
proceeding.
there
are
several
references
not
in
relationship
to
the
specific
counts
for
which
these
defendants
were
indicted
but
in
the
general
testimony
of
those
same
defendants
wherein
the
commission
very
obviously
did
not
press
for
a
reply
of
questions
which,
for
lack
of
any
other
indication,
i
must
assume
the
commission
felt
might
conceivably
be
incriminating
by
a
--a
view
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
witness,
the
known
circumstances
and
a
view
of
the
possible
directness
of
the
question
itself.
however,
that
does
not
apply
to
any
of
the
questions
which
were
made
counts
in
these
three
indictments.
there,
there
was
a
number
of
the
counts,
16
in
all
to
begin
with,
against
mr.
raley
which
were
determined
and
were
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
complete
appellate
review
of
the
trial
proceedings
and
all
that
had
gone
before
it
where
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
charges
as
to
those
counts
in
which
there
had
not
been
an
express
or
an
obvious
intent
on
the
part
of
the
committee
chairman
or
a
member
of
the
committee
to
receive
an
answer
to
the
question
asked.
now,
several
places
in
the
record,
that
situation
develops
in
this
fashion,
the
witnesses
asked
the
question,
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment
and
says
that
he
wants
to
have
something
to
say
about
it.
the
chairman
then
says,
“well,
how
would
that
tend
to
--
will
you
explain
how
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
you?”
“i
claim
the
fifth
amendment.”
“is
there
anything
in
that
question
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
you?”
that
is
one
process.
another
process
that
is
repeated
in
regard
to
some
of
these
counts
is
this.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
i
--
i
would
agree
with
mr.
johnson
and
possibly
very
closely
to
that.
i
say
there
are
two
instances
in
which
there
is
obviously
a
direction
to
answer.
now,
again,
that
direction
to
answer
does
not
take
the
--
the
formal
regular
law
or
routine
that
this
court
has
observed
is
--
is
not
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
witness
claiming.
we
suggest
the
same
ritual
is
not
necessary
on
the
part
of
a
chairman
or
a
judicial
or
legislative
officer
ordering.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
at
several
places
you
will
find
the
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
the
reference
repeated
three
different
times,
“will
you
answer

the
--
the
chairman.
now,
at
--
at
no
time
will
this
chairman
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
--
in
this
record
say
“i
order

question.”
we

we
do

a
thing.
mr.

but
--
mr.

yes.
mr.

in
the

we

several
places
of

major
in

of

mr.

hover
“the

questions

by

the
witness,
“i

i
might
add
that,”
so
and
so
and
so.
the
chairman,
“before
adding
anything
will
you
answer
the
question?”
the
witness,
“i
will
answer

the
chairman,
“after
you
answer

you
may
add
anything
you

the
witness,
“i

“you

so
we
will
not
permit
you

counsel,
will
you
ask
the
next
question?”
another
example
of
it
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
that
is
one
where
we
feel
there
is
a
--
a
very
definite
intention
expressed
on
the
part
of
the
chairman
speaking
for
the
commission.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
but
the
commission
does
expect
an
answer
and
that
the
witness
is
possibly
expecting
to
answer
until
he
is
pressed
three
times,
“will
you
answer
the
question?”
then
i
take
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
the
chairman,
at
another
point,
i
am
reading
now
from
the
transcript
of
the
record
itself,
which
is
before
the
court,
page
99.
chairman
renner,
“mr.
raley,
the
commission
would
like
to
have
you
give
an
answer
to
that
question.
i
will
ask
the
question
be
repeated.
let
the
stenotypist
repeat
the
question.”
the
question
then
is
repeated.
the
chairman
adds
to
it,
“we
would
like
you
to
--
to
know
whether
or
not
you
recall
the
interview.
you
may
say
yes
or
no.
do
you
recall
the
interview
or
don't
you
recall
it?
if
you
recall
it
and
we
ask
you
about
your
recollection,
you
may
claim
your
--
your
privilege
to
claim
your
rights
under
the
constitution,
but
it
is
our
opinion,
it
is
my
opinion
that
you
have
no
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
answer
the
question
whether
or
not
you
recall
an
interview”.
then
the
witnesses'
own
counsel,
who
was
at
his
side,
intervenes.
the
witness,
“mr.
chairman,
if
you
will
forgive
the
witness
for
taking
his
legal
advice
from
me
rather
than
from
the
committee.”
chairman,
“you
may
advise
your
witness
what
is
right,
sir.”
attorney,
“i
certainly
will.”
chairman,
“i
am
not

that
you
advised
him
not
to
give
an
answer.”
attorney,
“i
had
not.
i
didn't
advise
him
to
give

i
pointed
out
that
you
were
telling
him
what
the
law
is
and
with
all
due
respect
that
is
my
function.”
the
--
they
say
it
is
never
--
the
--
the
ritual
never
in
this
record
with
this
chairman
and
these
witnesses.

at
adjournment
yesterday,
there
was
some
definite
uncertainty

possibly
even
some
confusion
even
if
that
were
confined
solely
to
counsel,
on
the
suggestion
that
the

defendants

brown
case.
at
some
however,
other
been
deceived
or
entrapped
into
committing
the
offenses
with
which
they
were
subsequently
indicted.
that,
the
--
the
basis
for
that
suggestion
is
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
one
of
the
judges
of
the
original
consideration
of
the
case
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
in
that
judge's
own
words,
the
suggestion,
or
the
basis
from
which
this
suggestion
is
made
is
as
follows.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
i'm
reading
from
page
236
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
harlan,
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
second
last
paragraph.
“commission
was
composed
in
part
of
able
and
experienced
lawyers
and
the
hired
special
counsel
and
yet,
the
defendants
were
informed
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
that
they
had
a
right
to
rely
on
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.”
and
then
skipping
over
to
the
very
last
sentence
of
the
same
dissenting
opinion.
“under
the
situation
in
the
present
cases,
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
defendants
after
being
apprised
by
the
commission
that
they
had
a
right
to
rely
upon
the
protection
against
self-incrimination
could
not
be
in
contempt
with
the
commission
except
as
to
the
few
questions
which
two
of
them
were
directed
to
answer.
i
want
to
make
this
point,
nowhere

this

hearings
is
there
any
statement
from
the
chairman
of
this
commission
or
from
any
member
of
it
along
the
lines
stated
here
as
the
fact
backing
that
portion
of
this
dissenting
opinion.
you
will
recall
that
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
when
it's
hearing
this
matter,
is
hearing
two
cases
involving
four
defendants.
what
maybe

took

to
another

i

frankly,
i

i

beyond

the
state's
position
here,
is
to
point
out
that
even
that
judge
in
his
dissent,
reserves
for
his
own
consideration
without
deciding
the
possibility
that
two
of
the
three
defendants,
raley,
brown
or
stern
may
in
his
own
language
be
in
contempt
except
as
to
the
few
questions
which
two
of
them
were
directed
to
answer.
and
the
record
there
is
clear
in
regard
to
these
three
defendants
in
case
number
175.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
he
--
he
did
not
join
in
the
court's
opinion.
he
does
--
he
makes
no
expression
as
to
whether
he
would
reverse
or
what
he
would
do
with
it.
mr.

watson
hover
except
in
his
own
words
as
to
possibly
questions
which
two
of
the
defendants
were
directed
to
answer.
now,
those
--
and
i
say
the
--
the
majority
in
the
supreme
court
did
not
rest
its
opinion
on
that
basis.
the
court
of
appeals,
hearing
this
case
on
appeal
at
the
state
level
did
go
thoroughly
into
each
and
every
circumstance
behind
each
and
every
count
in
again
the
three
cases,
raley,
stern
and
brown.
beginning

the
record,
judge
mathews

that
--
that

--
member
--
three-member
court
on
a
district
level.
judge
mathews
wrote
a
lengthy
and
i
--
i
suggest
earnestly
to
this
court
and
exceedingly
well-reasoned
and
complete
opinion
covering
all
phases
of
this
subject.
he
picks
up
these
indictment
counts
one
by
one.
and
he
reads
out
as
he
proper
--
as
--
as
probably
is
correct.
he
weeded
out
all
of
those
counts
in
which
there
had
been
an
indictment
for
the
refusal
to
answer
a
question
of
the
commissions'
counsel.
and
in
doing
so,
it
was
a
rather
extensive
weeding
job.
the
conviction
of
raley
was
affirmed
on
seven
of
16
counts
and
reversed
on
all
other
accounts.
the
conviction
of
stern
was
affirmed
as
to
a
first
count
and
reversed
as
to
others.
the
conviction
of
brown
was
affirmed
as
to
all
four
counts
for
which
he
had
been
indicted.
the
reasoning
of
judge
mathews
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
those
counts
which
were
affirmed
by
his
court,
does
not
go
to
the
extent
of
ruling
that
there
was
a
specific
positive
requirement
that
the
witness
received
a
direct
order
to
answer
a
question
in
order
to
be
in
contempt.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
to
the
effect
that
the
witness
under
the
circumstances
where
the
committee
chairman
or
a
member
of
the
committee
is
asking
the
questions
that
there
is
a
--
an
order,
an
implied
order
to
answer.
or
there
is
an
expectation
of
receiving
an
answer
inspite
of
the
fact
that
the
refusal
in
all
but
three
of
these
various
counts.
the
--
the
refusal
to
answer
was
not
followed
by
a
specific
and
direct
order
of
either
the
chairman
or
a
committee
member
to
the
witness
that
we
expect
an
answer.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
the
grounds
for
the
refusal
were
almost
without
exception
to
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
at
one
--
there's
one
point
of
refusal
in
one
indictment
were
the
witness
merely
says,
“i
don't
think
its
any
of
your
business.”
mr.

watson

yes,

mr.

questions.
mr.

yes.
now,
that
is
further
added
too
by
three
specific
counts
in
the
indictments
where
there
was
a

what
certainly
must
be
deemed
a
direction
to
answer.
mr.

mr.

on
the
basis
that
he
does

business.

he
did

he
did
not
mention
or
even
attempt
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
in
regard
that
specific
question.
and
that
too
is
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
first
reviewing
court.
the
ground
for
the
refusal
was,
“i
just
don't
think
it
is
your
business.”
it's
told
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission,
would
--
would
decide
the
question,
and
then
proceeded
to
ask,
“do
i
understand
for
the
record,
you
are
refusing
to
answer
the
question
because
you
feel
it
is
not
our
business?”
to
which
the
defendant
responded,
“the
answer
is
the
same.”
mr.

hover
on

i'm
reading
from
193

the
opinion,
that
will
be

mr.

that
then
he
comes
in
the
next
answer
and
says,
“no,
i
just
don't
think
it
is
your
business.”
“is
there
anything
about
that?
the
answer
to
that
question
may
tend
to
incriminate
you.”
“no,
i

mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
he
--
he
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
he
invokes
it
and
then
denies
that
he
invoked
it
apparently.
and
still
of
course
rests
on
a
reason
sufficient
or
probably
unto
himself
for
refusing
to
answer.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
not
at
all.
no,
no,
justice
black.
we
--
we
do
not
claim
that.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
one,
one
question
later.
he
says,
“no,
i
just
don't
think
it's
any
--
it
is
your
business.”
that
--
that's
one
question
later.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
i
--
i
think
he
is
saying
there
that
i
don't
think
there
is
--
if
may
paraphrase
the
question
and
answer.
it
seems
to
me
he
has
saying,
“no
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
about
some
communist
party
school
or
a
particular
illegal
institution
i
may
have
attended
that
would
make
me
hesitate
to
reveal
where
i
have
been
educated.
no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
it
is
none
of
your
business.”
now,
that
is
the
way
i
at
least
read
that
question
and
answer.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
i
--
i
think
that
still
the
reason
he
is
not
answering
that
as
he
said
himself
is
“i
don't
think
it's
any
of
your
business.”
mr.
c.
watson
hover
yes.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
he
asked
them
additional
question.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
it
--
it
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
not
at
all.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
examiner
has
a
right
and
apparently,
does
some
thinking
at
least,
possibly
the
duty
to
inquire
into
the
--
the
possible
reason
for
invoking
the
--
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
with
a
view
to
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
some
conceivable
justification
on
the
part
of
the
witness
for
invoking.
the
--
the
chair
is
asking
him,
“what's
your
educational
background,
is
there
something
about
it
that
would
make
you
hesitate
to
revealed
it?”
he
says
no,
i
--
i
--
first
when
the
plaintiff
regard
to
question,
“i
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.”
“then
is
there
something
about
it
that
would
make
you
hesitate
to
reveal
it?”
“no,
i
just
don't
think
it's
any
of
your
business.”
now,
that
--
that's
the
--
and
there
was.
and
in
fact,
the
original
plaintiff
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
these
questions
were
planed
by
this
--
by
the
chairman
of
this
commission.
the
--
the
hearing
developed
and
it
proceeded
from
question
to
question.
i
--
i
--
at
least
in
--
i
don't
--
i
was
not
present
myself
at
these
hearings.
but
in
reading
this
record
a
number
of
occasions
with
in
the
past
seven
years,
i
--
i
can't
see
any
fixed
pattern
of
the
--
of
the
questioning.
i
can
see
a
fixed
intention
to
get
information
if
possible
in
various
fields
but
the
--
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
fixed
pattern
in
the
questioning
as
developed.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
that
is
done
on
occasion
in
some
of
these
counts,
yes.
where
the
claim
of
the
privilege
has
not
been
accepted
by
the
chairman
or
the
commission
to
the
extent
of
saying,
“you
--
you
claim
the
privilege?”
we
realize
the
door
is
completely
positively
and
irrevocably
barred
against
us.
that
--
that
pattern
does
not
appear,
it
does
not
on
a
--
on
a
number
of
this
questions
whether
they
form
the
subject
matter
of
these
indictments
or
not.
the
--
the
commission
has
proceeded
for
an
additional
two
or
three
questions.
it
never
reaches
the
point
and
possibly,
we
don't
use
cross
examination
in
the
same
--
in
the
same
frame
work,
but
it
--
that
to
me,
this
--
this
record
never
reaches
the
point
where
i
at
least
would
consider
it
cross
examination.
now,
a
few
more
questions,
two,
three,
four,
at
the
most,
to
elicit
why,
if
there'll
be
a
reason
why.
yes,
that
--
that
exist.
the
--
the
commission
did
not
just
bluntly
stop
and
say,
“well,
you
--
you
say
fifth
amendment.
that
it
the
magic
word,
it
bars
us.”
we
could
not
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
i
--
i
call
it
an
additional
question
to
--
in
an
attempt
to
elicit
additional
information
then.
i
--
i
can
imagine
a
dozen
directions,
but
--
but
the
cross
examination
at
least
in
a
rather
technical
sense
of
the
word
would,
could
and
possibly
should
take
it
that
point.
this
is
one
additional
question,
and
that
--
that's
all.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
that
one
is
the
--
that's
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
that
is
right.
on
the
--
the
163
--
the
--
the
questions
on
163
form
the
basis
of
the
second
the
third
counsel
against
brown.
again,
there
was
no
direction
to
answer
just
a
simple
direct
question,
a
simple
direct,
review
so
that
the
--
i
think
we
all
interpret
as
being
the
--
as
being
invoked
of
the
fifth
amendment
when
he
says
the
answer
is
the
same.
there
--
there
was
never
any
question
that
--
that
it
was
a
--
the
commission
assumed
that
that
is
what
he
meant.
mr.
c.
watson

which
second
question?
mr.
c.
watson

oh,
were
coming

the
--
the
second
question
of
that
series?
mr.

hover
decided,
they
asked
a
man
for
something
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
mr.
c.

very
certain.
he
was
not

him,
“is

meaning
as
i

it,
is
that
what
you
want

mr.

watson
hover
the
quotation
on
page

what
i

brennan's
question.
mr.

that

testimony

you
in
regard

it
was
the
policy.
your

your
recollection
there
is
better

mine.
however,
the
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
that
statement,
whether
the
chairman's
recollection
as
a
witness
is
good,
better
and
different.
that
statement
was

these
defendants.

all
here.

contempt
to
trial.
mr.

my

there

a
refusal

answer.
mr.

these
indictments
are
laid
under
a
statute
which
makes
it
an
offense
to
refuse

answer
a
question

which
a
witness

lawfully
interrogated.

mr.

i

members
just

refusals

let

then
turn
them
over
for
prosecution
after
the
committee
had
gone
through
its
statutory
proceedings
to
affect
that
ultimate
end.
and
these
indictments
flowed
from
that.
the
indictments
where

do
not

all
of

questions.
there

there
was
a
distinct
effort
made
to
avoid
indictment.
on
the
basis
of
what
the
committee
had
meant
to
operate.
that
is,
we
will
not
press
where
there
seems

be
some
reasonable
ground.
and
that

the
indictments
flowed
from
that
exact

thinking.
now,
whether

the
picking

choosing
was
a
100%
accurate
is
of
course
open
to
question

that
was
the
purpose.
well,
i'm

yes.
mr.

it
was
a
question,
if
i

may

add,
that
was
not
pressed.
mr.
c.

hover
well,
that

that
is
again
reading
the

the
two
series
of
questions
and
answers
on
invoking
the
privilege.
mr.
c.
watson

now
again,
if
the
second
answer
is
read
as
"no",
i
am
not
invoking
a
privilege

i
am
not
fearful
that
there
will
be
any
incrimination.
mr.

“i

then
--
then
the
--
then
the
--
at
least
the
possibility
of
raising
a
debatable
question
of
incrimination
arises
which
is
what
the
--
what
the
indictment
did
for
the
trial
purpose.
mr.

constituted
the
major
portions

the
questions
for

indictments
were
had.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
yes.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
well,
not
the
major
portion
of
the
--
mr.
c.
watson

correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
yes.
that
--
that
question
has
already
been
considered.
not
--
not
judicially
but
isn't
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
it's
in
the
large
for
this
reason
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
--
that
the
first
count
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
exceedingly
so.
the
--
the
first
count
of
raley
was
among
those
which
were
dismissed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
--
that
gives
rise
to
your
question
right
--
right
there.
the
sentence
was
guilty
on
all
counts.
and
then
the
court
exercised
a
privilege
which
is
rather
standard
practice
of
making
sentences
run
concurrently.
there
--
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
docket
of
the
record
to
say,
“i
find
you
guilty
of
the
--
the
first
count,
and
you
do
10
days
on
that.
and
i
find
you
guilty
of
all
the
others.
and
i--
i'm
just
going
to
forget
about
those.”
that
is
not
this
record
and
not
--
not
ohio
procedure.
the
person
is
found
guilty
and
sentenced
on
all
counts
and
the
sentence
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
oh,
yes.
in
this
case
it
was
engrossed.
you're
indicted
for
16
counts,
you
were
found
guilty
of
16
counts.
you
are
filing
--
fined
--
and
i
think
the
fine
in
10
days,
$500
something.
and
the
sentences
aren't
--
be
run
concurrently
in
the
fines
paid
that
way.
so
as
i
say,
that
--
that
question
has
been
in
this
case
for
--
for
sometime,
they're
just
not,
at
least
up
to
this
point,
been
occasioned
to
--
to
bring
it
into
the
actual
proceedings.
it's
--
it
has
been
considered
not
the
fact.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
oh,
yes.
the
--
these
are
separate
indictment
counts.
i

i'm
speaking
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
10
days
and
$500,
i
--
i
believe
suggest.
the
--
mr.
c.
watson
hover
a
separate
count
in
one
indictment.
the
indictment
consists
of
16
counts,
each
count
being
a
specific
refusal.
the
--
those
are
the
16
counts
which
we
have
--
should
impartially
meted
out
already.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
yes.
with
the
sentence.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
all
of
them
concurrently.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
but
still
there's
just
one
sentence.
that
is
one
--
one
period
of
time.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
yes
sir?
mr.
c.
watson
hover
now,
you
--
you
are
undoubtedly
correct.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
watson
hover
the
chairman
did
not
ever
claim
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
(voice

mr.
c.
watson

that
is
so.
mr.
c.
watson

no.
mr.

no.
mr.

the
indictment
counts,
none

them.

oh,
excuse
me,
sir.
excuse
me.
mr.
c.

the
question.
i

mr.

no
one,

indicated.
