indeed
that
they
had
to

are

are
you
raising
this

justice
william

that
is
violation
of

justice
william
j.
brennan,

don't
you
have
this
peculiar
practice
of
--
of
--
perhaps
i
shouldn't
say
peculiar,
practice
of

rather
than
opinions
or

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
how
--
what
you
mean
when
you
said
you
thought
you
were
entitled
to
heavy
opinions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
had
was
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
you
had
was
just
a
short

--
justice

oh.
justice
william

brennan,

incidentally,
has
any
of

questions
to
which
they
were
indicted,
if
he
will
answer

did
they

privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
all
present
when
the
chairman
told
them
that
they
were
free
to
assert
privilege?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
a
fair
sample
that
appears
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
at
page
548,
the
chairman,
“mrs.
morgan,
i
should
like
to
advise
you,
under
the
fifth
amendment,
you
are
permitted
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
you.”
mrs.
morgan,
“yes.”
the
chairman,
“but
you
are
not
committed
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
simply
for
your
own
convenience.
counsel
may
proceed.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
just
what
the
supreme
court
is
on
the
sale
or
the
chairman
obviously
misstated
the
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
question
at
155
you
referred
us
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
proof
will
be
forthcoming?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
chairman's
instructions
or
will
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
this,
of
course,
is
not
part
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
--
this
is
not
part
hearing
record.
this
is
part
of
the
trial
record
discloses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
his
recollection
of
what
he
did,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
may
or
--
i
haven't
examined
the
actual
hearing
record
but
does
what
he
said
here
as
to
the
question
or
the
answer
he
gave
the
witness,
is
that
born
out
as
to
--
in
the
actual
hearing
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
the
chairman
told
him
that
he
was.
chairman
told
him
that
he
was
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
supreme
court
finally
says,
as
i
read
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
that
no,
that's
not
the
law
and
the
chairman
was
wrong
in
anyway.
this
fellow
knew
that
the
chairman
was
wrong.
that's
the
effect
what
you
spoke
of
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
let's
--
let's
see
if
it's
not,
mr.
hover.
isn't
this
true,
nowhere
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
nowhere
on
interrogating
any
of
these
three
witnesses
that
the
chairmen
ever
tell
them
that
they
had
immunity,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
were
many,
many
instances.
you
pointed
some
out
to
us
now,
i
think
page
163,
in
which
the
witnesses
pleaded
the
privilege,
usually
by
saying
same
answer
applies.
and
in
none
of
those
cases,
at
least
at
163
and
those
pages
around
163
was
the
witness
ever
pressed
to
answer,
was
he?
after
he
impleaded
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
not,
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
otherwise
they
were
not
pressed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
and
the
chairman
then
said
that,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
quoted
it.
that
it
was
not
the
policy
to
press
it,
to
allow
them
the
take
the
--
the
privilege,
even
though
they
didn't
like
a
statement
with
--
a
direct
statement
that
it
was
that
the
policy
of
the
commission
not
to
press
question
which
we
felt
would
be
of
incriminating
nature.
can't
we
take
that
as
supported
by
the
record
as
to
the
interrogations
of
these
very
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
--
i'm
suggesting
you
agree
with
me
what
record
shows.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
shows
that
he
never
told
them
they
had
immunity
and
he
never
pressed
them
for
an
answer
when
they
pleaded
the
fifth
except
in
the
three
instances
pointed
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
--
now
certainly,
this
must
as
to
the
atmosphere
of
that
hearing.
i
think
you
agreed
earlier,
wasn't
one
to
suggest
that
immunity
was
available,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
there's
nothing
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
hearing
at
all
would
suggest
that
was
available.
and
--
nor
was
there
anything
in
the
atmosphere
at
that
hearing
to
suggest
that
the
privilege
was
totally
irrelevant,
was
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
don't
you
think
the
committee
members
where
in
large
part
responsible
for
that,
for
the
very
reasons
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
johnson,
what
about
preceding
the
direction?
about
that
question
that
preceded
the
direction
to
answer
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
chairman
put
the
question,
“is
there
something
about
the
nature
or
character
of
the
home
in
which
you
live?
that
to
admit
you
live
there
would
make
you
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.”
that
question
was
asked
in
the
privilege
pleaded
before
the
direction
was
given
by
the
chairman.
is
there
anything
in
that
which
will
suggest
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
ohio
supreme
court
finding
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
find
--
is
that
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
over
--
an
express
which
he
hold
the
rest
the
decision
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indeed,
they
expressly
rejected
it.
you
gather
the
state
advanced
that
theory,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
your
--
but
your
on
supreme
court
refused
to
rest
its
judgment
in
any
ways
on
that
theory,
did
it
not?
