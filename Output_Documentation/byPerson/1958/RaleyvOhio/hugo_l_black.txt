that

that
was

in
which
you
referred,

it?

was
that

will
you
answer
the
question?
so
in
page
44.
what
was
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
was
talking
about
your
--
the
first
part
of
the
record
you
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
you
gave
it
is
the
illustration
of
this
one
as
i
understood,
why
he
told
him
to
answer
the
question.
i
just
don't
know
what
question.
the
best
i
could
make
out
he's
asking
to
confess
he
committed
perjury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
that.
what
--
what
was
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
the
question
that
they
were
insisting
to
be
answered?
back
on
page
143
or
not?
“i
asked
you,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
on
may
28th,
when
you
falsely
enforced
him
to
sign
that
affidavit
before
(inaudible)
you
are
in
fact
the
member
of
the
communist
party.”
is
that
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
deny
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
at
all
in
connection
with
what
he
said
on
144
that
--
will
you
answer
the
question?
was
there
anything
to
any
part
of
the
question
been
referred
to
trying
to
get
him
to
say
that
he
had
committed
perjury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
perjury?
would
that
be
perjury
under
the
laws
of
ohio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
come
under
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
it
--
could
it
conceivably
not
be
perjury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
did
he
ask
him
anything
about
such
exception?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
committee
chairman
ask
permission,
chairman
asked
him
of
anything
about
those
possible
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
hundred
exceptions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
chairman
of
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
not
relevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
where
a
man
feigns
the
benefit
of
the
seven
against
self-incrimination,
feigns
it
specifically
and
pointedly.
and
the
committee
ask
--
well,
the
question
--
have
continued
to
ask
him
questions
about
it
as
though
he
had
not
raised
it.
and
if
he
doesn't
repeal
unequivocally
each
time,
he'd
waive
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here,
he
has
unequivocally
declined
to
answer
about
educational
background
on
the
grounds
which
tend
to
incriminate
him.
and
then
he
starts
the
cross
examine
him
no
why
he
won't
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
that
waived
his
objection
he'd
had
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
maybe
he
was
saying
that
that's
a
man
claimed
the
privilege,
of
as
a
genuine,
bonafide
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
practice
of
continuing
the
cross
examine
as
to
why
he
claims
the
privilege.
there's
not
any
of
that
in
this.
and
that
--
what
do
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
--
suppose
a
man
does
claim
the
privilege
genuinely
and
honestly
and
it's
it
s
a
good
claim.
do
you
think
it
is
any
of
the
question
as
in
this
to
continue
to
cross
examine
him?
he
tried
to
make
him
tell,
at
least
infer
that
he
is
guilty
of
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
he
claims
his
constitutional
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
somewhat
on
their
approach,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
seriousness
of
the
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
any
doubt
assuming
if
the
fifth
amendment
applied?
would
you
have
any
doubt
to
this
second
question?
did
call
for
self-incriminating
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suddenly
--
put
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
any
doubt
what
that's
called
or
if
that's
on
--
fifth
amendment
is
applicable.
and
under
the
brown
case
and
under
numerous
cases
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
be
a
trying
to
get
a
man
to
incriminate
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
doubt
that
he's
won?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
--
what
about
asking
if
he's
extended
some
particular
illegal
institution,
do
you
think
it
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
discriminate
a
man
to
admit
he
had
attended
an
illegal
institution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what's
he
indicted
from.
i'm
talking
about
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
asking
about
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
the
second
question,
that
there's
any
lawyer
who
hears
that,
that
would
deny
that
that
ask
a
man
to
incriminate
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
deny
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
plainly
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
plainly
on
its
face.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
he
had
--
after
he
had
just
declined
to
answer
about
his
educational
background
on
that
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
hover,
i
have
just
read
the
entire
evidence
to
mr.
brown,
the
questions
that
were
asked.
and
am
i
right
in
thinking
this?
they
cover
--
question
and
answers
cover
15
printed
pages.
i
didn't
figure
out
the
time
but
i
would
say
that
we
must
claim
the
fifth
amendment,
75
to
100
times.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
chairman
intervened
at
the
number
of
times
to
be
sure
he
was
claiming
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
chairman
did
not
ever
indicate
to
him
at
any
time
from
the
first
to
the
last
question
to
what
i
can
find.
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
his
claiming
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
that
he
was
not
entitle
to
claim
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
all
the
questions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
were
asked,
he
would
decline
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
they'd
just
go
on
to
another
question,
all
of
them
practically
about
the
communist
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
most
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
like
number
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
indictment
counts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
now
the
--
the
evidence
interrogation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
showed
that
from
the
beginning
to
the
end,
he
relied
on
the
claiming,
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
no
one
ever
indicated
to
him
by
any
word,
either
the
chairman
or
the
question
that
there
was
--
that
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
--
which
one
of
those
two
questions
made
the
basis
of
the
counts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
did
he
--
where
did
the
chairman
of
the
commission
asked
him
to
answer
that
personal
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
one
that
he
requested
the
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
follows
immediately
after
that
second
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
something
about
the
nature
or
characters
of
the
home.
“which
you
live,
and
to
admit
you
live
there
would
make
you
subject
to
criminal
prosecution,”
the
same
answer.
chairman
renner,
“the
chair
will
request
that
the
witness
answer
the
question.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
after
he
had
asked
him
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
shown
to
that
--
on
page
142
whether
that
was
the
residence,
that
was
asked
about
his
home.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they
asked
him
the
next
one,
“as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
reside
at
3959
wilson
avenue
in
the
city?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
other
question
which
again
to
(inaudible),
has
been.
if
this
--
did
all
this
determination
appear
the
same
day
in
cincinnati?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
it
occurred
in
the
morning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
raley
testified
in
the
morning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
were
all
summoned
there
for
that
day.
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
three
witnesses,
they
were
present.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
1:15,
adjourn
until
2:00.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
they
call
stern
or
brown
and
then
finished
with
him
and
called
the
others.
so
it
was
all
a
part
of
one
continuous
session
that
day.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
all
have
met
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
outside
of
the
first
two
questions
about
her
residence?
were
all
the
questions
asked
about
her
relationship
with
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
record
seems
to
show
this.
am
i
wrong
about
it
that,
there
had
been
a
witness
to
have
a
rule
--
had
been
interrogated
asking
her,
asking
the
witness
about
this
mrs.
morgan's
activities
in
the
communist
party
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
had
been
sitting
--
she
had
been
sitting
and
heard
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
you
wanted
to
say
--
do
you
seems
to
say
that
he
did
unless
i
must
read
it,
maybe
i
do,
and
that
she
was
sitting
there
at
the
time?
and
at
that
the
same
time,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
told
this
witness
he
could
claim
his
right
except
against
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
yes.
further
question
was
asked
as
supposed
to
be
of
him.
"did
anna
morgan
at
that
time
have
any
official
title
in
the
communist
party?"
i
don't
believe
she
has.
was
she
serving
any
particular
task
if
she
can
be
more
or
less
at
large."
but
she
organizes
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
right
after
page
61.
right
after
that
--
right
after
question,
it
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
own
knowledge
whether
mrs.
morgan
was
present
during
that
hearing
or
at
least
you
spent
during
the
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
stands
in
your
judgment
merely
for
the
fact
that
she
was
sitting
there
and
heard
him
tell
the
witness
just
before
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
had
the
right
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
can't
refuse
to
testify.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
she
came
on,
she
vote
in
a
statement,
the
closing
paragraph
of
which
was
that
she
would
not
--
she
claimed
the
right
of
self-incrimination
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
against
self-incrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
she
--
then
the
first
question
was
asked
and
she
kept
it
up,
and
kept
it
up
throughout.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wasn't
much
used.
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
wasn't
indicted
for
that.
