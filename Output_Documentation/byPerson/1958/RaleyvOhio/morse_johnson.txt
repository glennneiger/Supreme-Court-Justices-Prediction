mr.
morse
johnson
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
question
presented
by
this
appeal
is
whether
or
not
the
compelled
interrogation
of
the
appellants
before
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
violated
their
basic
constitutional
liberties
as
established
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
basic
simple
facts
may
be
briefly
stated.
these
appellants
were
subpoenaed
as
to
be
witnesses
in
front
of
the
house
on
--
front
of
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
on
october
the
20th,
1952
in
cincinnati,
ohio.
they
arrived
at
the
hearings
and
the
hearings
were
held.
the
only
guidance
that
they
had
is
to
what
was
under
inquiry,
what
the
purpose
of
the
commission's
hearings
at
that
time
were,
where
the
mandate
itself
coupled
with
a
few
general
statements,
which
i
will
refer
to
later,
made
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission.
the
chairman
of
the
commission
advised
these
witnesses
that
they
had
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
available
to
them
should
the
questions
as
--
seek
incriminating
--
incriminating
information.
mr.
morse
johnson
the
appellants
were
assured
or
the
witnesses
before
the
commission,
mr.
justice
douglas,
were
assured
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
admonished
and
advised
that
if
questions
sought
incriminating
information,
these
--
these
witnesses
could
assert
their
privileges
or
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
morse
johnson
wait.
i'm
sorry
to
take
you
--
so
long,
your
honor,
i
didn't
--
on
record
99,
134
and
157
as
to
each
appellant,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
record
99
as
to
appellant
raley,
record
134
as
to
appellant
stern
and
at
record
157
as
to
appellant
brown.
mr.
morse
johnson
157,
your
--
mr.
justice.
in
addition,
mr.
justice
douglas,
throughout
the
colloquies
or
the
questioning
the
--
it's
implied
in
--
in
much
of
the
discussion
between
the
witnesses
and
the
commission
members
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
available.
for
instance,
questions
were
asked
as
to
whether
or
not
that
did
really
seek
incriminating
information
or
how
would
it
incriminate
the
witness.
there
was
no
doubt
and
it
can't
be
argued,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
its
decision
in
this
case
stated
that
the
chairman
of
the
--
of
the
commission
had
obviously
in
its
opinion
misstated
the
law
and
there
is
no
question
here,
but
that
the
facts
of
the
case
are
--
are
clear
that
these
witnesses
were
advised
clearly
and
unequivocally
and
repeatedly
that
they
had
their
privileges
against
self-incrimination.
and
it
might
be
further
notice
that
to
each
of
the
questions
for
which
these
witnesses
were
indicted
and
which
formed
the
counts
in
their
indictments,
they
had
asserted
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
in
all
but
one
instance,
that
privilege
had
been
automatically
accepted.
there
was
no
countermanding
order
saying
that
the
--
the
commission
itself
rejected
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
or
refused
to
accept
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
ordered
and
answered.
in
only
one
of
the
questions
which
formed
the
three
indictments
was
there
a
specific
and
direct
order
by
the
commission
to
answer
the
question.
the
trial
was
held.
the
jury
was
waived
even
at
the
--
at
the
early
--
earliest
opportunity
on
the
motions
to
cross
the
indictments.
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
now
before
this
court
were
raised
by
the
appellants.
the
trial
judge
found
the
appellants
guilty
on
all
accounts
and
found
in
--
in
effect
in
an
oral
opinion
that
the
questions
that
formed
the
counts
of
the
indictments
did
not
seek
incriminating
information
and
therefore,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
not
available
and
therefore,
they
were
guilty
of
contempt
of
the
ohio
commission.
the
appellants
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
district
of
ohio,
which
court
of
appeals
reaffirmed
the
position
of
the
trial
court
in
stating
that
the
questions
had
not
sought
incriminating
information
and
therefore,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
not
available.
but
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
make
a
further
point
that
under
the
law,
that
under
which
these
appellants
were
indicted,
there
was
a
requirement
that
a
direction
or
order
to
answer
be
given
the
witnesses
before
the
full
act
of
contempt
under
the
law
is
--
is
completed.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
district
in
ohio
found
that
when
--
or
--
or
it
found
that
such
an
order
had
impliedly
been
given
when
the
question
had
been
asked
by
a
member
of
the
commission
itself
as
distinguished
from
counsel
for
the
commission.
and
so
it
reversed
the
convictions
as
to
all
counts
which
involved
questions
asked
by
the
counsel
of
the
commission
and
affirmed
as
to
all
questions
asked
by
the
member
of
the
commission.
the
appeal
is
then
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
which,
for
the
first
time
in
the
proceedings,
held
that
the
ohio
immunity
statute
applied
to
these
commission
hearings.
the
ohio
immunity
statute
set
out,
of
course,
in
--
in
the
brief.
and
that
since
the
--
since
these
witnesses
were
immune
from
prosecution
as
to
any
matter
for
which
they
might
testify
before
the
commission,
they
therefore
had
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
therefore
their
assertions
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
through
the
questions
asked
them
by
the
commission
in
which
formed
the
counts
of
the
indictment
were
acts
of
contempt
and
were
willful
defiances
and
where
therefore
--
they
were
therefore
guilty
and
so
--
mr.
morse
johnson
right,
your
honor.
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
supreme
court
held
that
since
the
ohio
immunity
statute
as
they
found
then
at
that
--
in
this
decision
was
applicable
to
these
proceedings
before
this
commission.
the
witnesses
having
immunity,
therefore,
could
not
assert
the
privilege
of
--
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
is
also
under
the
--
also
granted
under
the
ohio
constitution.
mr.
morse
johnson
i'm
afraid,
your
honor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
immunity
statute
but
the
--
mr.
morse
johnson
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
it
does,
your
honor.
there
is
no
attack
here
--
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
morse
johnson
he
--
the
--
the
supreme
court
decision
simply
said,
“despite
the
fact
that
the
chairman
of
the
commission
had
obviously
misstated
the
law,”
and
i
quote
directly
from
the
opinion,
“nevertheless,
these
witnesses
did
not
have
the
privilege
and
therefore,
their
assertions
of
the
privilege
were
willful
defiances
and
contempt
of
the
--
mr.
morse
johnson
there
is
an
ohio
immunity
statute,
if
i
understand
--
mr.
morse
johnson
no,
no,
your
honor.
the
immunity
statute
was
never
mentioned
at
the
hearings.
the
commission
assumed
that
the
immunity
statute
was
not
applicable.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
morse
johnson
your
honor,
the
--
the
problem
is
--
is
set
out
really
in
justice
--
judge
taft's
dissent
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
the
theory
then
--
then
and
judge
taft
dissented
from
this
decision
on
the
grounds
that
the
immunity
statute
only
applied
to
committee
hearings
as
distinguished
from
commission
hearings,
that
it
had
to
be
a
--
a
committee
of
the
legislature
which
is
the
word
--
is
the
language
of
the
ohio
immunity
statute.
and
judge
taft
found
that
the
immunity
statute
did
not
apply,
therefore,
he
dissented
from
this.
mr.
morse
johnson
it
was
a
legislative
commission
within
the
--
within
the
--
as
part
of
the
legislature,
that's
correct.
mr.
morse
johnson
there
is
a
long
history
of
differences
between
commissions
and
committees
as
to
other
matters,
your
honor,
too
and
--
mr.
morse
johnson
that
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
--
that
is
--
mr.
morse
johnson
well
--
mr.
morse
johnson
as
to
this
question.
yes,
you're
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
might
just
complete
the
round
of
these
basic
facts
to
state
that
four
judges
of
the
supreme
court
made
this
finding.
one,
as
i've
pointed
out,
mr.
--
judge
taft
dissented
on
this
committee
commission
point
found
that
the
immunity
statute
not
being
available.
the
privilege
was
available
and
that
evidently,
he
--
he
concluded
that
the
privilege
could
be
asserted
to
the
questions
which
formed
the
counts
of
the
indictment
and
he
dissented.
and
a
second
dissent
was
--
was
based
on
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
that
these
witnesses
did
have,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
which
i
shall
detail
later,
that
privilege
offered
by
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
third
dissent
was
by
judge
stewart
on
the
very
question
that
we're
now
discussing,
how
could
these
men
be
in
contempt
when
they
merely
accepted
the
admonition
of
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
asserted
the
words
of
their
privilege
even
though
the
privilege
later
was
determined
to
be
not
applicable
at
least
the
body
that
was
supposed
to
be
held
in
contempt
or
--
or
willfully
defied
by
the
--
by
the
witness?
this
appellant
had
accepted
it.
mr.
morse
johnson
i
am
raising
it,
your
honor,
as
an
--
as
an
independent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
if
this
--
the
operation
of
the
--
of
the
mandate
to
the
commission
together
with
the
immunity
statute
could
entrap
witnesses
in
these
ways
that
they're
unconstitutional
at
the
outset
or
in
the
way
that
the
effect
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
an
appeal
was
docketed
from
this
decision
in
the
--
in
this
court
and
almost
simultaneously
with
the
sweezy
and
watkins
case.
the
cases
this
court
vacated
the
judgments
of
conviction
that
--
that
had
been
affirmed
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
remanded
the
--
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
watkins
and
sweezy
cases.
this
reconsideration
was
had
on
oral
argument
in
brief
and
resulted
in
a
very
brief
per
curiam
opinion
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
it
merely
stated
the
conclusion
that
it
adhere
to
its
former
judgments
and
it
found
no
applicability
or
relevance
in
the
sweezy
and
watkins
case.
again,
there
were
only
four
judges
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
signing
that
opinion,
judge
taft
again
dissented
and
two
judges
who
had
sat
on
the
case
did
not
make
their
positions
known.
mr.
morse
johnson
they
did
not
concur
nor
dissent,
your
honor,
although
they
sat
and
heard
the
case.
mr.
morse
johnson
i
don't
think
it
means
anything,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
it
gives
--
we
--
we
raise
the
point
on
our
application
for
rehearing
that
we're
entitled
to
have
the
opinions
of
all
judges
who
sat
on
the
case
but
we
found
no
--
no
authorities
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
ohio.
mr.
morse
johnson
your
honor,
i'd
be
afraid
to
answer
that
question
not
having
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
we
had
noted
and
--
and
you
get
opinion.
mr.
morse
johnson
syllabus.
it's
the
same
system
as
--
as
in
this
--
prevail
on
this
court.
mr.
morse
johnson
oh,
you
mean
the
judges
--
i
don't
--
mr.
morse
johnson
oh,
exactly,
i
--
i
understand.
i'm
lost,
your
honor.
yes,
the
syllabus
becomes
the
ruling,
correct.
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
we
--
we
thought
we're
entitled
to
have
whether
or
not
the
judges
who
sat
on
the
case
felt
that
the
--
that
the
sweezy
and
watkins
case
did
or
did
not
apply
to
reverse
the
convictions
of
contempt
which
--
which
were
being
appealed
at
that
time.
mr.
morse
johnson
pardon
me.
mr.
morse
johnson
per
curiam
signed
by
only
four
judges.
mr.
morse
johnson
and
seven
had
sat
and
one
dissented,
so
two
did
not
make
their
opinion.
although
i'd
--
i'd
simply
point
that
as
your
honor,
it's
really
not
basic
to
the
--
to
the
main
issues
in
this
case.
now,
these
witnesses,
when
they
were
appellants,
when
they
were
subpoenaed,
had
only
before
them
the
mandate
to
the
commission
which
gave
the
commission
the
authority
to
make
the
investigation.
certainly,
if
the
sweezy
and
watkins
mandates
are
indiscriminate
and
vague,
this
one
is
all
--
this
one
is
completely
and
totally
indiscriminate
and
vague.
i
simply
sight
one
sentence
and
i
might
state
at
this
time
that
none
of
the
--
not
one
of
these
witnesses
knew
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
what
part
of
the
authority
or
what
purpose
of
the
--
the
commission
had
--
had
called
them
before
it
for.
the
--
the
main
sentence
that
i
think
shows
the
only
inclusive
sweeping
authority
that
the
commission
had
which
made
it
absolutely
impossible
for
any
witness
no
matter
how
well-advised
by
counsel
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
matter
was
pertinent
to
any
inquiry
that
the
commission
might
be
authorized
to
make
was.
the
commission
was
--
was
authorized
to
investigate
all
facts
concerning
persons
whose
activities
might
adversely,
might
adversely
affect
the
functioning
of
any
agency
of
the
state
or
federal
government
or
the
industrial
potential
of
the
state.
in
other
words,
it
would
appear
and
i
--
it
is
submitted
that
under
that
kind
of
authority
might
adversely
affect
all
facts
concerning
persons
whose
activities
might
adversely
affect
any
inquiry
was
--
was
allowed.
anything
was
pertinent
and
all
things
being
pertinent,
it
was
impossible
and
utterly
impossible
for
any
witness
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
commission
had
the
authority
or
have
been
given
the
authority
to
ask
the
questions
they
were
ultimately
asked.
there
was
no
way
to
judge
pertinent.
the
witness
becomes
helpless.
i
might
say
that
throughout
the
hearings
and
certainly
at
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman
of
the
commission,
there
was
no
further
delineation,
no
further
clarification
as
to
why
these
witnesses
before
this
commission,
for
the
purposes
of
this
inquiry.
the
--
the
chairman
of
the
commission
only
open
by
showing
an
extreme
hostility
to
the
witnesses
pointing
out
that
they
have
practice
fraud
and
deception
and
said
that
they
feared
exposure
of
un-american
activities
conducted
in
secret.
this,
your
honors,
was
the
only
delineation,
if
you
please,
made
by
the
commission
throughout
the
hearings
and
certainly
at
the
outset
which
the
witnesses
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
commission
had
the
authority
to
subpoena
them
before
it
and
whether
the
commission
had
authority
to
ask
the
questions
it
ultimately
asked.
i
might
point
out
that
the
very
first
witness,
the
appellant
raley
before
he'd
even
asserted
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
protested.
this
is
in
the
record
on
page
80
and
81,
the
pertinence
or
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry.
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
questioning?
and
the
answer
was
only
this
was
if
--
within
the
scope
of
our
inquiry.
there
was
no
further
guidance
given
to
the
appellant
raley
and
--
and
the
other
witnesses
were
present
at
the
time
when
he
first
opened
up
the
question
of
the
pertinent
--
of
the
--
of
the
inquiry
and
the
pertinence
of
a
particular
question.
since
the
grant
of
authority
is
so
broad,
it
permits
and
encourages
the
kind
of
questioning
and
the
kind
of
proceedings
that
the
record
reflects
took
place
on
october
the
28th,
1952.
i
think
that
nowhere
do
we
find
the
attitudes
that
unfortunately
begin
to
prevail
when
you
allow
state
legislative
committees
or
any
other
kind
of
committee's
unlimited
latitude
to
investigate
into
any
area
that
they
might
investigate
into.
when
we
take
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
of
one
of
the
appellant
and
that
is
the
fourth
question
of
the
fourth
count
of
the
indictment
for
appellant
ground,
he
was
asked
and
indicted
and
convicted
for
not
answering
this
question,
“where
you
active
in
1947
in
the
election
in
the
city
of
cincinnati
in
supporting
any
candidate
or
any
issue
on
the
ballot
in
that
election?”
that
--
that
--
the
conviction
for
reducing
to
answer
that
question
now
is
appealed
from
and
is
before
this
court.
mr.
morse
johnson
raley
is
one
of
the
appellants.
mr.
morse
johnson
they,
your
honor,
answered
--
mr.
morse
johnson
they
answered
a
few
questions
of
--
appellant
raley
answered
quite
a
number
of
questions
up
until
the
point
they've
got
to
associations
and
--
and
who
he
knew
and
the
like.
mr.
morse
johnson
appellants
--
mr.
morse
johnson
where
he'd
worked,
what
he
had
done,
what
he'd
done
in
the
war,
what
union
--
what
union
he
belong
to.
the
basic
background
sort
of
personal
questions
up
until
the
point
that
they
involved
activities,
associations,
protest,
speeches,
passing
of
leaflets,
who
he
knew
and
who
is
associated
with.
mr.
morse
johnson
he
wanted
to
make
an
opening
statement,
your
honor
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
which
--
which
he
was
allowed
to
make
after
the
hearings
were
through
in
which
he
challenged
the
whole
authority
of
the
commission
to
--
mr.
morse
johnson
he
did
answer
some
question,
sir.
mr.
morse
johnson
now,
appellant
stern,
your
honor,
the
second
question,
he
refused
to
answer
and
it
was
--
and
--
one
of
the
questions
in
the
indictment,
i
want
to
get
it
exactly,
“where
do
you
reside,
mr.
stern,
previously?”
and
then
he
answered
some
more
questions,
a
considerable
history
as
to
where
he
worked
in
phoenix,
arizona
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
then
he
began
to
stop
at
the
same
point
where
appellant
raley
stop
--
start.
i
should
point
out
that
appellant
stern,
we
make
quite
an
issue
of
this
in
front
of
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
at
that
time,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
question
had
been
incriminating.
and
later
on
in
the
hearings,
appellant
stern
has
asked
the
question,
“did
frank
hashmall
come
and
reside
with
you?”
now,
frank
hashmall
was
the
best
known
communist,
if
your
honor
please,
the
self-identified
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
southern
part
of
ohio
and
we
urged
at
that
time
that
the
reason
--
because
of
the
length
in
the
chain
theory
of
--
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that
he
refused
to
answer.
but
he
answered
many
other
basic
questions
along
--
mr.
morse
johnson
brown
answered
up
until
a
point,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
it
is
not
true
that
they
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
shut
off
all
inquiry.
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
one
of
the
questions
asked
in
the
indictment
was
the
question
of
whether
mr.
stern,
appellants
stern,
and
to
what
extent
he
had
worked
in
the
progressive
party.
and
he
now
stands
indicted
and
convicted
for
contempt
for
refusing
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
morse
johnson
to
each
of
the
questions
that
they
were
indicted
to.
each
of
them,
there
is
not
one
that
they
did
not
assert
that
--
mr.
morse
johnson
the
record
does
not
show
that,
your
honor,
but
each
appellant
during
his
inquiry
was
assured
by
the
chairman
that
he
had
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i've
cited
that
for
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
your
honor,
he
made
--
i
would
suppose
20
to
30
statements
in
the
record
in
--
in
connection
with
the
privilege.
he
may
at
on
time
have
said
that.
he
--
he
--
at
other
time
said,
“we
will
not
press
for
answers
if
they're
incriminating.”
he
--
he
had
at
other
time
said
that
he
is
--
he
--
he
agreed
that
this
question
would
be
incriminating
and
therefore
no
answer
would
be
necessary,
the
question
whether
another
kind
of
question
would
be.
there
are
number
of
statements
which
not
only
directly
assert
that
the
witnesses
were
granted
the
privilege
but
also
imply
it
by
the
--
by
the
very
discussion,
the
colloquy
that
it
did
went
on
between
the
witnesses
and
--
and
the
chairman.
mr.
morse
johnson
i
would
say
that
that
was
a
fair
statement,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
--
exactly
that
explicitly
it
was
made
in
each
of
these
instances
but
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
found
and
it's
--
it's
a
part
of
this
case
that
the
chairman
of
the
commission
had
obviously
misstated
the
law
and
had
granted
these
witnesses
the
privilege.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
correct.
in
addition
a
--
mr.
morse
johnson
in
only
one
instance
in
the
question
that
formed
a
count
from
the
--
from
the
counsel
indictment.
there
were
many
questions
asked.
there's
never
been
any
understanding
as
to
why
some
of
the
questions
didn't
form
parts
of
the
counts
of
the
indictment.
there
were
only
two
in
stern,
four
in
brown
and,
i
think,
16
or
18
in
--
in
raley.
but
in
none
of
the
questions
which
--
which
became
--
not
one
of
the
questions
which
became
a
count
in
the
indictment.
was
there
a
clear
and
certain
direction
to
answer
after
the
privilege
have
been
inserted
except
for
one,
excuse
me
for
saying
it
that
way,
your
honor,
the
very
first
question
to
appellant
stern,
“where
do
you
reside,
mr.
stern?”
the
only
time
the
commission
ever
engaged
in
what
we're
now
talking
about
in
turn
and
--
and
directly
that
ordered
the
--
the
witness
stands
to
the
question
was
for
that
question.
all
the
rest
of
the
--
all
the
rest
of
the
questions,
the
answers,
their
assertions
of
the
privilege
were
accepted
by
the
--
by
the
commission.
i
think
that
this
question
of
--
of
offering
the
privilege
and
not
asserting
--
not
--
not
insisting
on
an
answer
becomes
even
more
relevant
than
we
recognized
that
the
witnesses
or
the
appellants
in
this
case
were
indicted
under
what
is
known
as
the
judicial
contempt's
statute
of
the
--
of
the
ohio
code.
unlike
the
appellant
in
the
companion
case
here
who
was
incited
under
the
legislative
contempt's
section,
these
witnesses
were
indicted
under
the
judicial
contempt
section.
that
judicial
contempt
section
had
been
interpreted
and
held
by
the
courts
of
ohio
and
been
--
been
commented
upon
and
i
have
so
stated
in
my
reply
brief
as
to
require
a
direction
to
answer
in
order
for
the
--
for
the
contempt
to
be
complete.
so,
we
have
witnesses
before
us
--
we
have
witnesses
before
the
commission
who
were
assured
and
admonished
that
they
could
have
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
use
the
word
asserting
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
were
not
countermanded,
were
not
directed
to
--
to
order
an
answer
and
under
no
circumstances
could
any
lawyer
have
advised
a
witness
at
that
time.
under
the
laws
of
ohio
--
well,
certainly
under
the
contempt
law,
judicial
contempt
section,
and
certainly
under
any
interpretation
of
what
is
fair
in
--
in
legislative
procedures
as
far
as
offering
a
man
the
privilege
and
then
having
it
later
rejected
by
the
supreme
court.
no
lawyer
could
have
advised
and
no
witness
could
have
concluded
that
by
asserting,
as
these
witnesses
did,
their
privileges
to
these
questions
that
they
were
then
to
be
held
in
contempt
of
the
--
of
the
commission
and
--
and
convicted
for
the
same
and
sentenced
to
fines
and
imprisonment.
i
think
that
i
should
point
out
further
that
the
whole
nature
of
these
hearings
which
becomes
extremely
important
not
only
to
these
witnesses
and
why
they
stand
convicted
but
to
the
due
process
demands
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
over
90%
of
the
questions
asked
to
these
witnesses
were
of
the
“is
it
not
a
fact?”
“is
it
not
a
fact
that
you
committed
a
crime
or
were
arrested
in
des
moines,
iowa?
is
it
not
a
fact
that
you
were
--
you
were
again
arrested
in
des
moines,
iowa?
is
it
not
a
fact
that
you
falsely
and
fraudulently
signed
this
affidavit?
is
it
not
a
fact
that
you
did
this
or
did
that?”
there
is
no
question
but
that
a
substantial
majority
will,
over
90%
of
the
questions,
sought
information
which
the
commission
already
assumed
it
had.
this
is
most
particularly
noted
and
i
think
the
hearings
are
characterized
by
this
question.
and
i
think
this
is
what
goes
to
the
vice
of
allowing
commissions
to
have
unlimited
authority
to
ask
questions
in
any
area
of
inquiry
that
they
might
want
to
ask
questions
in.
appellant
brown,
one
of
the
witnesses,
was
asked
the
question
about
his
attendant
at
a
meeting
and
he
answered
in
some
way.
i
don't
know
whether
he
asserted
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
but
he
then
stated,
“do
you
know
i
was
at
that
meeting?
have
you
proved
that
i
was
at
that
meeting?”
the
answer
of
the
commission
chairman
was,
“the
proof
will
be
forthcoming
the
moment
you
deny
it
under
oath.”
now,
these
--
mr.
morse
johnson
your
honor,
that's
on
page
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
record
page
155
towards
the
bottom.
these,
it
is
submitted,
your
honors,
show
that
the
type
of
investigation
that
was
being
conducted
here
was
not
an
investigation,
that
it
was
an
inquisition.
it
was
an
attempt
to
entrap
witnesses
towards
whom
some
of
the
members
or
all
the
members
of
the
commission
felt
a
certain
hostility
and
a
certain
adversity.
it
was
--
it
was
an
attempt
to
expose
to
hostile
light
witnesses
before
the
commission.
i
see,
your
honor,
that
i
have
expended
as
much
time
as
i
would
like
to
at
this
point
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
further
time
i
might
have
until
after
the
state
concludes.
mr.
morse
johnson
i
hate
to
do
it
to
the
state
at
this
time
but
--
mr.

johnson

mr.
morse
johnson
down
towards
the
bottom
--
mr.
morse
johnson
yes.
do
you
have
proof?
mr.
morse
johnson
the
proof
will
be
forthcoming
from
the
moment
you
deny
under
oath.
mr.
morse
johnson
thank
you.
mr.
morse
johnson
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
call
again
the
court's
attention.
i
regret
that
there
has
been
so
much
confusion
about
exactly
what
the
chairman
said
and
what
the
commission
meant,
to
the
record
on
page
99.
at
the
middle
of
the
page
and
this
is
one
of
the
questions
which
form
the
indictment,
the
--
the
--
a
count
in
the
indictment.
where
chairman
renner,
contrary
to
what
the
state
has
--
has
apparently
asserted
here
clearly
has
told
the
witness
that
he
had
their
--
had
privileges
under
the
constitution.
“we
would
like
to
know
whether
you
recall
that
interview.
you
may
say
yes
or
no.
do
you
recall
that
interview
or
don't
you
recall
it?
if
you
recall
it,
and
we
ask
you
about
your
recollection,
then
you
are
privileged
to
claim
your
rights
under
the
constitution.
but
it
is
our
opinion,”
and
note
here,
your
honors
how
carefully
he
then
circumscribed
himself
but
it's
our
opinion
--
it
is
my
opinion
that
you
have
no
constitutional
right
to
refuse
the
--
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
recall
that
interview.
now,
it
appears
to
me
following
on
through
from
99
on
to
a
100
that
chairman
renner
at
--
at
that
point
having
told
the
witness
that
he
could
assert
his
rights
under
the
constitution
then
went
on
to
indicate
that
he,
personally,
felt
may
be
that
the
--
that
the
witness
could
not
but
as
it
gets
over
to
the
--
to
the
middle
of
page
100,
it
--
chairman
renner
seems
to
indicate
that
he
finally
accepts
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
contrast
that,
if
the
your
--
if
the
court
would
please,
with
record
at
132.
mr.
morse
johnson
he
then
asked
the
witness
to
check
with
his
counsel,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
to
create
and
consolidate
counsel
to
determine
whether
in
his
opinion,
you
are
required
to
answer
the
question
whether
you
recollect
having
had
such
an
interview.
the
witness,
i've
been
--
advised
by
counsel
that
the
privilege
does
apply
if
i
desire
to
use
it.
chairman
renner,
“counsel
may
proceed.”
mr.
morse
johnson
if
--
if
the
interview
--
if
you'll
pardon
me
your
honor,
i
didn't
quite
understand
you.
mr.
morse
johnson
no,
your
honor,
that
refers
back
up
to
the
third
paragraph
or
second
question
on
page
99.
“let
me
refer
to
an
article
carried
in
a
cincinnati
post

“schools

union
agent

(inaudible)
and
refers
to
an
interview
with

do
you
recall
that
interview?”
and
then
that
question
became
one
of
the
counts
in
the
indictment
which
the
appellant
raley
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
might
incriminate
him
under
the
--
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
ohio
constitution.
the
interview
itself
was
never
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
appellant
raley
and
the
newspaper
reporter.
now,
we
have,
as
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
--
that
colloquy
on
page
99
and
then
we
have
the
one
question
that
i
would
submit
is
the
only
--
only
one
where
the
--
the
witness
was
at
least
directed
to
answer
the
question.
that's
the
--
that's
the
appellant
stern's
first
count
in
--
in
his
indictment
on
page
132.
he
--
he
asserts
his
privilege
and
chairman
renner
says,
“the
chair
will
request
that
the
witness
answer
the
question.”
the
witness,
“i
have
answered
the
question”
mr.
isaacs,
“mr.
chairman,
i
asked
the
witness
to
be
ordered
and
directed
to
answer
the
question.”
chairman
renner,
“the
chairman
directs
the
witness
to
answer
the
question
relating
to
his
address
and
so
forth
and
so
on.”
mr.
morse
johnson
i
say,
your
honor,
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
witness
was
at
--
and
--
and
this
is
the
only
instance.
it
is
our
position
where
the
--
where
the
commission
actually
ordered
and
directed
an
answer
that
at
this
--
at
this
point,
appellant
stern
was
told
that
the
--
that
the
commission
ordered
and
directed
him
to
make
an
answer.
mr.
morse
johnson
whether
that
question
could
be
put
to
him?
your
honor,
i
--
i
mentioned
yesterday
and
i'd
like
to
mention
again
today
for
--
for
that
very
purpose.
if
--
if
the
court
would
turn
to
the
record
at
page
141,

in
the
middle
of

there's

question
down
or
the
third
question
down.
“is
it
not
a
fact
in
march
of
1950,
frank
and
sylvia
hashmall,
frank
hashmall
being
the
district
organizer
for
the
communist
party
and
i'll
add
to
it.
your
home
became
the
communist
party
headquarters
for
this
section.”
now,
i
think
--
mr.
morse
johnson
it
is
to
be
assumed
that,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
yes.
mr.
morse
johnson
if
--
mr.
morse
johnson
if
--
it
later
developed,
your
honor,
that
the
--
the
commission
or
the
--
or
the
investigating
body,
whatever
it
might
be,
had
possession
of
information
that
they
thought
was
--
was
factual,
that
this
man's
home
had
been
or
was
then
--
the
headquarters
of
--
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
morse
johnson
your
honor
will
note
--
mr.
morse
johnson
you
--
your
honor,
well
note
that
following
that
question,
mr.
stern
did
reply
to
many
questions
and
gave
--
gave
the
commission
factual
answers
as
to
where
he'd
worked,
where
he
attended
school,
what
he'd
done
and
--
mr.
morse
johnson
in
--
in
phoenix
or
--
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
the
witness
was
aware
of
the
--
of
the
alleged
information
that
the
commission
had
about
his
home
being
the
--
the
headquarters
of
the
communist
party.
is
it
incumbent
on
the
--
on
the
witness
to
say
“i
do
not
wish
to
testify
as
to
where
i
live
because
i'm
fearful
that
you
might
ask
me
further
questions
about"
--
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
a
question
of
a
judge
asking
questions,
we
have
a
question
of
the
commission
which
it
had
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
a
previously
and
throughout
this
hearing,
indicated
that
it
had
a
lot
of
incriminating
or
what
he
considered
incriminating
information
about
these
witnesses.
mr.
morse
johnson
there
is
nothing
preceding
this
question.
but
there
is
certainly
something
subsequent
to
this
question.
mr.
morse
johnson
well
--
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
i
think
your
honor,
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
i
--
i
--
mr.
morse
johnson
because
there's
something
about
the
--
mr.
morse
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
unless
your
honor
would
like
to
investigate
further
into
that
area,
i
--
i
should
like
to
point
out
how
important
--
mr.
morse
johnson
that
the
--
i'll
have
to
look
it
up,
your
honor.
“where
do
you
reside,
mr.
stern?”
that's
the
very
--
“will
you
state
your
name
please?”
answer,
“joseph
stern,”
at
the
very
top
of
page
132.
question,
“where
do
you
reside,
mr.
stern?”
and
then
he
answered,
there's
no
further
--
specific
word
--
mr.
morse
johnson
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
he
was
talking
about
the
second
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
talking
about
when
he
gave
a
direction
to
order
an
answer
but
i
think
the
implication
is
that
he
was
still
asking
where
he
lives.
mr.
morse
johnson
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
morse
johnson
that
the
court
concluded
that.
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
regret
that
that
--
i
regret
we
have
to
go
on
further
than
that
because
chairman
renner
finally
says,
“this
is
prejudicial
to
my
own
case.”
the
chairman
directs
the
witness
to
answer
the
question
relating
to
his
address,
the
address
of
his
residency
in
cincinnati.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
would
--
has
been
our
position
--
mr.
morse
johnson
3595
wilson
avenue
in
the
city
of
cincinnati,
ohio.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate,
your
honor,
that
that
residence
which
is
--
as
specified
or
identified
at
page
132
is
the
residence
that
they
were
talking
about
on
page
141
as
being
the
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
communist
party
headquarters
and
i
have
no
knowledge
about
that.
i
should
like
to
call
the
court
--
mr.
morse
johnson
excuse
me.
mr.
morse
johnson
three
is
on
91.
mr.
morse
johnson
well,
this
count
on
of
the
stern
indictment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morse
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
they
were
all
present.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
present
--
that's
present.
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
remember
the
exact
hours.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
number
three,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
“that
was
the
headquarters
of
local
766
(inaudible)
at
that
time,
isn't
that
correct?”
i
again
assert
my
privilege.”
mr.
raley,
would
you
explain
to
the
commission
how
you
could
incriminate
yourself
like
knowledge
and
the
location
of
the
headquarters.”
mr.
--
the
witness,
“i
don't
believe,
mr.
chairman,
that
i
have
to
give
the
reasons
for
asserting
a
privilege.”
chairman
renner,
“i
nevertheless
request
an
answer
as
to
the
--
as
to
why
you
think
it
would
incriminate
you,
not
as
to
the
--
not
as
to
the
question
for
which
there
had
been
an
indictment.”
and
there's
a
colloquy,
and
i
think
that
when
the
witness
says,
“i
think
i
was
correct
in
view
of
the
line
of
questions
that
i
have
to
assert
my
privileges
under
the
constitution.”
and
chairman
renner
on
page
92
answers,
“counsel
will
proceed,”
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
hold,
that
--
that
appellant,
raley,
was
put
on
notice
that
he'd
been
given
a
specific
and
direct
command
that
this
--
his
assertion
of
the
privilege
under
these
circumstances
had
been
rejected
by
the
entire
commission
and
considered
contimation
and
will
--
contumacious
and
willful
defiance
of
the
commission
following
that
colloquy.
particularly,
mr.
justice
harlan,
given
the
law
of
ohio,
and
might
be,
i
will
follow
the
reply
brief
in
this
--
in
this
case,
these
witnesses
were
indicted
under
the
judicial
contempt
section.
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
its
decision
state
that
the
--
that
amounted
to
merely
a
definition
as
to
what
shall
constitute
contempt.
i'm
quoting
from
the
record
at
page
230.
now,
there's
no
question
in
the
state
of
ohio,
the
cases,
for
the
practice
of
law,
the
secondary
authorities,
that
a
witness
must
be
directed
and
ordered
and
been
--
be
clearly
apprise
that
the
court
overrule
whatever
objection
had
been,
he
had
raised
or
his
counsel
had
raised
and
he
was
specifically
directed
to
answer
the
question.
this
is
the
applicable
section
under
which
these
counts
were
indicted.
mr.
morse
johnson
i
did
follow
your
entire
brief,
your
honor
--
mr.
morse
johnson
what
i
have
just
said.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
i
did
and
i
sent
it
on
to
this
court.
yes.
right.
mr.
morse
johnson
there
is
--
there
--
the
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
the
judicial
contempt
section,
which
states
that
--
there
that
--
that
willfulness
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
is
an
--
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
morse
johnson
under
case
law,
there
--
i
could
--
i
--
i
have
no
cases
where
willfulness
was
--
was
required.
but
there
are
cases
and
full
--
and
it's
written
in
the
books
have
replayed
with
citations
as
to
where,
to
--
in
order
to
complete
the
offense,
there
had
to
be
a
direction
so
that
the
witness
knew
that
the
commission
or
--
or
the
court.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
harlan,
were
you
still
interested
in
question
number
nine?
mr.
morse
johnson
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
he
later
--
mr.
morse
johnson
--
states
on
page
92,
"i
think
i
was
correct
in
view
of
the
line
of
questions
which
involve
the
headquarters
being
--
the
headquarters
of
the
communist
party
that
i
can
stand
on
my
privilege.”
mr.
morse
johnson
right,
your
honor.
i
--
all
that
the
chairman
has
said
there
is,
“it
is
my
--
but
it
is
our
opinion,”
and
then
he
changes
it.
and
mind
you,
your
honor,
we're
dealing
with
witnesses
in
front
of
the
commission
who
were,
as
this
--
this
court
has
frequently
held
in
the
wilson
case
and
so
forth,
to
render
a
considerable
amount
of
pressure.
they
have
to
make
decisions
quickly.
mr.
morse
johnson
this
gentleman
had
a
lawyer
with
whom
he
could
consult.
and
did
consult.
and
having
consulted
with
their
lawyer,
the
chairman
on
the
next
page
seems
to
--
seems
to
accept
counsel.
“i
have
been
advised
by
counsel
that
the
privilege
does
apply,
if
i
desire
to
use
it.”
“counsel
may
proceed.”
and
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
this
court
could
hold
that
this
witness
under
those
circumstances,
particularly
since
he
said
it's
my
opinion
as
distinguished
from
the
commission's
opinion,
had
overruled
his
assertion
and
found
at
a
contumacious
invocation.
mr.
morse
johnson
appellants
raley
and
stern
had
a
lawyer,
mr.
justice
black.
appellant
brown
was
without
counsel.
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
i
consider
a
very
important
element
in
this
case
which
--
which
is
as
relevant
to,
particularly
to
mr.
--
appellant,
stern's
refusal
to
answer
the
question,
the
point
where
--
where
you
live,
the
question
as
to
where
he
lives.
this
court
will
note
that
the
mandate
to
the
commission
required
or
--
or
authorized
the
--
the
commission
and
this
is
on
page
5
of
my
brief.
“to
maintain
a
liaison
with
any
agency
of
the
federal
state
or
local
governments
in
devising
and
promoting
means
of
disclosing
those
persons
in
groups
who
seek
to
alter
or
destroy
the
government
of
this
state
or
of
the
united
states
by
forced
filings,
intimidations,
sabotage
or
threats
of
the
same.
i
think
this
--
court's
attention
should
be
called
to
the
fact
that
throughout
these
hearings,
these
witnesses,
and
each
of
them
were
asked
many
questions
about
men,
their
associations
with
men,
their
friendship
with
men
who
were
then
under
indictment
under
the
smith
act
in
federal
court
who
had
been
convicted
of
--
of
a
violation
of
the
smiths
act.
but
more
importantly,
in
this
particular
instance
in
which
mr.
stern
refused
to
answer
the
question
as
to
where
he
lived,
frank
hashmall
was
later
alleged
to
have
been
at
his
residence.
frank
hashmall
subsequent
to
these
hearings
was
indicted
under
the
smith
act.
subsequent
to
these
hearings,
frank
hashmall
was
indicted
under
the
smith
act.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
it
--
it
was
very
proper
and
very
correct
for
--
for
appellant,
stern,
to
be
concerned
about
questions,
about
with
whom
he
lived
and
where
he
lived
and
who
lived
with
him,
particularly
given
the
fact
that
the
--
it
seems
to
be
to
the
commission's
opinion
that
mr.
frank
hashmall,
who
subsequent
to
these
hearings,
had
--
was
indicted
under
the
smith
act.
i
feel
that
this
--
this
whole
case
and
all
of
the
issues
that
the
case
raises
stand
or
indicate
one
thing.
human
experience,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
the
ollman
case
has
a
tendency
--
there
was
a
tendency
in
human
experience
to
abuse
power.
and
i
think,
your
honors,
that
not
only
is
there
a
tendency
to
abuse
power,
i
think
there's
a
tendency
to
abuse
power
in
the
same
way.
the
national
commission
on
law
observance
and
enforcement
summarized
the
rather
inglorious
history
of
the
star
chamber
and
the
high
commission,
the
ecclesiastical
courts.
and
pointed
out
that
in
those
days,
those
--
those
commissions
in
courts
which
did
not
operate
like
our
judiciary
does
today
exactly,
were
trying
to
do
much
the
same
things
and
have
the
same
tendencies
to
do
the
things
that
this
commission
had
tried
to
do.
to
not
have
a
specific
charge,
because
when
you
have
a
specific
charge,
it
requires
that
the
questions
must
be
pertinent.
to
be
authorized
to
poke
around
into
somebody's
life
and
--
and
into
their
activities
in
hopes
that
they
might
be
able
to
find
someway
to
condemn,
to
indict,
to
accuse,
to
expose
an
individual
whose
activities
may
have
created
a
certain
amount
of
hostility
on
the
--
so
far
as
the
commission.
and
i
suggest
that
the
whole
tenor
and
attitude
and
authority
of
this
commission
stem
back
or
generated
to
the
very
problems
that
--
out
of
this
high
commission,
out
of
this
star
chamber,
out
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
hail
specifically,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
the
operations
of
those
--
of
those
courts
were
much
the
same
as
legislative
investigating
commissions
can
be
if
they're
not
required
to
--
to
take
into
account
pertinence,
if
there
isn't
a
specific
matter
under
inquiry
so
that
he
witness
can
determine
whether
or
not
the
--
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
ask
the
question.
and
therefore
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
these
convictions
should
not
be
allowed
to
--
to
stand,
they
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
i
urge
their
reverse.
mr.
morse
johnson
commission.
mr.
morse
johnson
no,
it's
no
longer
alive
your
honor.
mr.
morse
johnson
i'm
deeply
honored,
your
honor.
