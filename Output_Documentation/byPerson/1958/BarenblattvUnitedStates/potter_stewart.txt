justice
potter
stewart
he'd
been
--
he
had
been
subpoenaed,
had
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--
does
the
subpoena
appear
on
the
record
here?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
inform
him
of
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry?
was
there
any
information
in
the
subpoena
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
or
the
investigation?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
factually
true,
as
is
represented
in
the
briefs,
i
think,
that
the
petitioner
here
had
been
present
in
the
room
during
the
day,
when
mr.
crowley
had
testified
that
he
was
a
communist,
had
been
a
communist?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
he
had
heard
mr.
crowley
testify
under
oath
that
--
that
he,
mr.
crowley,
had
been
a
communist?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
watkins
case
as
you
understand
it
and
this
--
this
is
a
rhetorical
question.
i'm
asking
for
information,
does
it
require
that
the
witness
object
on
the
ground
of
pertinency
in
order
to
preserve
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
--
is
that
not
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
security
of
the
statement
of
purpose
might
excuse
the
obscurity
of
the
objection?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
would
certainly
--
it
would
certainly
be
a
false
oversimplification
to
say
that
the
right
of
privacy
is
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
certainly
this
court
has
all
recognized
the
power,
very
broad
power
of
a
--
of
a
legislative
body,
the
national
legislative
body,
to
investigate
for
a
proper
purpose.
made
investigations
through
its
compulsory
process
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
ascertain
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
ascertain
facts
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
relevant
to
any
matter
within
the
proper
legislative
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
the
power
involved,
the
power
to
subpoena,
to
compel
witnesses
to
come,
to
give
relevant
information
that
is
relevant
to
a
proper
legislative
inquiry.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ennis,
isn't
--
aren't
you
confusing
a
little
bit
two
concepts?
let's
assume
this
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
all
these
activities
leave,
talks,
association
and
so
on.
but
isn't
that,
at
least,
conceivable
assuming
that
the
congress
may
have
some
interest
in
knowing
how
much
of
this
area
is.
how
large
these
associations
are.
how
--
just
how
--
how
much
there
is
of
it.
this
is
no
--
this
is
no
sanction
against
it.
this
is
no
--
certainly
no
criminal
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
from
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
from
any
source?
justice
potter
stewart
for
teaching
students
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
it
find
out,
by
compulsory
process,
how
many
students
are
learning
arithmetic?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
chemistry?
justice
potter
stewart
it
also
protects
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
also
assume
it
protects
the
right
of
a
--
anybody,
a
student
or
anybody
else,
to
study
or
not
to
study
arithmetic.
to
associate
or
not
to
associate
together
in
arithmetic
class,
but
certainly
couldn't
congress
properly
investigate
the
extent
that
students
are
studying
the
sciences
or
arithmetic
in
connection
certainly
with
obvious
connection
with
be
of,
for
the
grant
of
federal
funds
to
that
educational
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
