oh
yes,

but
if

if
the

i'm
asking

if
the
generality
of

if
a
statement
of
the
general
purpose
sufficiently
indicates
an
allowable
area
of
inquiry
was
made
and
the
witness
has
counsel,
would
it
be
to
severe
restriction
on
the
rights
of
the
individual
and
say
that
counsel
should
make
the
same
objections
of
pertinence
that
counsel
in
this
trial
court
has
to
make
if
he
doesn't
make
it
and
won't
we
(inaudible)
justice

i'm
just
thinking
out

justice

yes.
justice

suppose
they
take
this

suppose
they
did

of
this
case,
so
that
you
wouldn't
have
argued
the
first
point
on
the
general
purpose,
they
made
it
perfectly
clear.
but
then
questions
are
asked
which,
if
you
are
sitting
at
the
counsel
table,
leave
a
doubt
in
your
mind
or
(inaudible)
that
it's
pertinent.
if
you
didn't
make
the
objection,
would
it
be
a
little
too
stiff
to
allow
the
objection
of
pertinency
to
be
made
and
if
he
manifest
it
by
a
counsel.
i
think
the
very
different
situation
is
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
that
--
the
case
here,
but
would
you
cut
off
inquiry
assuming
it
can
go
into
union
matters,
you
could
cut
off
inquiry
with
the
education
activity
removed.
justice
felix

you
would.
that
is
--
i'm
getting
a
--
justice

i
think
--
i
was
about
to
say
some
of
my
favorite
labor
unions

now
you
made

--

are
vast
considerable

you
know

education

justice
felix

do
you
say
that
they
could
go
and
do
the
organizational
side
of
the
union,
but
not
as
--
not
as
it
arose
through
educational
activity.
justice

(inaudible)
justice

why
(inaudible)
--
why
wouldn't
the
--
couldn't
determine
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not
appropriation?
assuming
--
i'm
assuming
of
course
more
than
just
the
congress
voted
its
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
assuming
they
knew
what
was
going
on
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then,
gave
appropriations
that
are
indicated
or
--
and
that
the
record
even
indicate
it
would
be
used
for
--
in
the
pursuit
of
section
5,
why
wouldn't
appropriation?
appropriations
are,
of
course,
among
the
most
powerful
of
all
manifestation
of
congressional
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
the
meaning
in
that
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
meaning
out
of
appropriation
is
much
so,
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
wouldn't
hold
to
that
suppose
the
house
--
that
resolution
was
sent
hereafter.
if
we
appropriate
money
for
purposes
which
the
committee
pursued,
we
don't
have
to
use
words.
and
you
think
that
was
--
or
would
you
say
that
was
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
suggest
again,
we're
after
meaning
and
not
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
conveyed
by
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
assuming
if
the
appropriations
are
(inaudible)
--
i
don't
know
if
it
leads
to
the
facts
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
takes
things
only
as
noncontroversial,
but
i
think
(inaudible)
this
court
has
held
and
has
required
that
although
words
maybe
silent
and
although
words
may
contradict,
the
construction
could
upon
--
eventually
could
upon
it,
that
construction
may
be
put
because
practice
has
nullified
the
words
and
give
a
contrary
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
why
can't
you
apply
that
to
appropriation?
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
out
of
court
if
you
do
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice

appropriation
before
that.
all
right,
that's
your
answer.
you
said
the
appropriations
are
unambiguous
--
are
ambiguous.
justice
felix

meaningless.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
appropriations
are
addressed
to
the
claim
made
for
appropriation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix

you
don't
differ
because
i
don't
know
the
facts.

justice

you

mr.

you
greatly
attempted

say,
you're
so
good
why

why
do
you

why
do
you
make

going

--
justice

i'd

i
followed
that
part

argument,
but
as
--
but
on
the
merits,
you
--
justice

right.
justice

i
thought
you
might
answer
that
there
is
a
provision
in

about
bearing
on

justice

yes.
(inaudible)
about

religion
exactly
is
separation

state,
talking
about
religious
oath?
justice

yes.
yes,
i
just
wanted
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
monahan
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
suggest
that
to
debate
down
the
very
bill
which
you
just
referred,
the
recent
bill
passed
by
the
last
congress,
for
scholarship
and
so
on.
that
in
itself,
that
debate
disclosed,
at
least,
one
read
it
as
being
(inaudible)
how
alert
or
how
--
what
should
i
say,
sensitive,
that
he's
a
good
portion
of
congress
is
against
the
intrusion
in
the
federal
government
in
the
lawful
educational
matters.
how
much
they
are
on
their
guard
against
the
taking
over
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
i
don't
know
how
far
that
character
except
it
does
bear
on
the
district
between
inquiries
into
that
field
and
other
fields.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
have
seen
the
difficulty,
i
--
at
least
from
the
difficulty
by
the
position
taken
by
mr.
ennis
for
instance,
as
to
the
limit
that
would
be
imposed
upon
congress
to
find
out
--
i
forgot
how
much
they
voted,
that
is
a
over
a
five-year
program
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
what
--
what
limitation
that
would
impose
in
finding
out
what
use
is
being
made
of
that
money
or
to
what
ends,
what
education
has
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
are
not
--
these
are
not
simple
questions,
to
me,
at
least,
they're
very
difficult
questions.
but
it
does
bear
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
special
position
that
education
seemed
to
have
in
the
eyes
of
congress
when
(inaudible)
legislative
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
hope
the
government
could
take
the
opposite
position,
now
that
does
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
the
question
is
a
much
more
narrow
one
in
this
--
why
business
to
which
you
invite
us
namely
through
what
particularity
should
congress
speak
when
it
does
enter
this
view,
that's
all
that
i
see
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
it
can't
announce
the
subject
matter
with
more
particularity
than
your
rights
to
putting
the
umbrella
requires.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
the
field,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
they're
talking
about
the
resolution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
talking
about
the
relation
between
what
he's
inquired
and
doing
what
he
thought
right
to
inquire
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
he
was
authorized
to
inquire,
in
other
words,
the
scope
of
the
resolution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
he
deemed
to
be
his
authority
doesn't
establish
that
it
was
his
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
misconceived
your
--
the
scope
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
go
into
that
indirectly.
i
think
it
is
a
fact
that
the
major
fraction
of
money
spent
in
american
educational
institution
dealing
with
science
and
in
recent
years
come
from
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
surprised
and
i'm
delighted.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
question
would
have
that
admission.
