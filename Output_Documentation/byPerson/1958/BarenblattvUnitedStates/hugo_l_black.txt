justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
on
page
76,
it
means
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
barenblatt
was
present
when
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
prior
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wasn't
there
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
in
connection
with
your
argument
that
there
has
been
no
objection
raised.
if
these
facts
as
shown
in
the
record,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
and
maybe
it's
not
enough.
from
the
very
first,
mr.
barenblatt
said
that
he
had
objections
to
testify.
he
had
grounds
stated
in
the
paper
that
he
had
and
that
also
they
would
not
take
them.
he
kept
repeating
that.
finally,
he
said,
"i've
been
trying
to
answer
not
on
the
fifth
amendment,
but
on
--
but
on
the
grounds
stated
in
my
objection
that's
presented
to
the
members
of
this
committee
which
you
have
not
allowed
me
to
read.
and
if
that
showed,
one
of
the
grounds
of
this
objection
was
that
if
the
purpose
disclosed
is
not
a
legitimate
ones,
he
may
not
be
compelled
to
answer.
i'm
quoting
from
another
opinion
of
this
court
that
a
witness
rightfully
may
refuse
to
answer
by
the
bounds
of
the
power
are
acceded.
why
was
that
enough
--
not
enough
objection
on
the
ground
that
he
didn't
know
what
the
purpose
was?
maybe
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
your
--
second
part
of
your
argument,
that
--
that
they
actually
informed
him.
but
what
more
could
a
man
do
when
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
--
but
he
--
he
said
that
this
is
not
a
preliminary
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
proceeded
to
tell
this
is
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
--
this
states
the
grounds
of
my
objection
to
testify.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
it
was
a
repeated
statement,
and
here
in
quotation,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
witness
--
well,
he
repeat
it
twice.
quotation
as
to
jones
and
the
securities
&
exchange
commission,
they
specifically
set
this
point
interrogated
by
the
private
affairs,
has
the
right
to
point
and
to
know
why
the
inquiry
was
made.
and
the
purpose
of
course,
was
not
legitimate
would
not
be
compelled.
and
the
other
one
was
that
the
witness
may
rightfully
refuse
to
answer
by
the
bounds
of
the
power
acceded.
that
was
in
the
grounds
of
objection
that
he
offers
thought
continually
called
their
attention.
why
is
it
not
--
not
that
enough?
maybe
it's
not
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
did
state,
if
i
declined
to
answer
when
they
asked
him
this
question
on
the
grounds
stated
in
my
objection
and
presented
to
me
by
the
members
of
this
committee
that
it
would
not
allow
me
to
read,
those
grounds
were
a
part
of
--
that
the
--
he
had
a
right
to
be
informed
of
the
purposes
why
the
inquiry
be
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
this
could
not
be
compelled
to
answer,
unless
it's
otherwise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
he
assigned
it
to
the
particular
question
one
by
one
and
just
look
at
this,
they're
my
grounds
for
saying
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
original
resolution
that
bears
on
the
subject
precisely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
resolution
that
or
that
stayed
on
the
resolution
that
congress
has
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
indicates
that
they
were
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
investigating
what
they
thought
exclude
what
it
comprises?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
in
the
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
in
your
report
about
the
resolution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
this
particular
inquiry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
up
to
the
time,
this
have
been
done,
there
was
nothing
in
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
language
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
was
that
after
the
resolution
after
the
past
authorizing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
continuing
fashion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
thought
you
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
reading
from
quotations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
a
court
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
this
court
in
the
later
opinion
at
least
a
majority,
referred
to
an
opinion
of
another
court,
which
should
accepted
that
being
the
statement
of
the
court
as
judicial
knowledge
stated
that
it
was
not,
but
that
was
the
separate
views
of
mr.
justice
jackson
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
your
views
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right,
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
individual
views,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask,
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
about
the
subsidies,
where
did
this
man
teach?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
i
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
he
teaching,
when
they
brought
him
down?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
support
that
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
because
the
government
contributes
funds
as
to
who
would
have
the
right
to
make
inquiries
about
something
if
it
takes
being
thought
as
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
because
you
had
talked
about
the
subsidies
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
probably
at
the
other
place.
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
your
bearing
was
and
if
--
if
your
bearing
changed
to
be
that
we
should
be
rather
free
and
construing
a
resolution
to
authorize
an
investigation
into
educational
teaching.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
are
arguing
that
which
is
a
very
natural
argument
had
made
many
times
as
i
gather
it,
that
since
the
government
has
contributes
--
if
the
government
contributes
(inaudible)
to
a
school
of
any
kind,
it
would
--
that
would
constitute
--
you
have
a
constitutional
basis
for
it's
looking
into
their
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
certain.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
arguments
would
apply
on
both
the
public
and
private
schools.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
garner
would
be
controlling
in
this
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
is
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i've
insisted
that
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have,
but
i've
never
been
able
to
get
the
courts
to
say
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
you.
