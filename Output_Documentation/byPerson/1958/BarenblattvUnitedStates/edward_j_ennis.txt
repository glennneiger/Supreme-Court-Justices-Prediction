mr.
edward
j.
ennis
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
through
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
a
conviction
in
affirmance
of
the
conviction
of
a
witness
for
refusal
to
answer
questions
before
a
--
before
the
house
of
representatives
un-american
activities
committee.
the
court
of
appeals
heard
this
case
the
first
time
by
one
division
of
the
court
and
this
court
grants
certiorari
but
returned
the
case
for
further
consideration
of
the
court
in
the
light
of
the
decision
in
the
watkins
case.
the
court
upon
the
remand,
all
of
the
judges
heard
the
case
en
banc,
and
in
an
opinion
by
judge
bastian
of
which
judges
prettyman,
miller,
danaher
and
burger
confers.
the
majority
of
the
court
held
in
the
light
of
watkins
that
the
conviction
should
stand.
chief
judge
edgerton
and
judge
bazelon
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
they
said
that
they
read
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
watkins
case
as
a
ruling
that
the
mandate,
the
charter,
the
resolution
of
congress
to
this
committee
conferred
no
power
to
investigate
any
subject.
and
the
second
ground
of
the
decision
was
if
the
resolution
could
be
construed
as
conferring
power
to
investigate
some
subject,
it
could
not
be
construed
as
conferring
power
to
investigate
the
subject
of
communism
in
education.
circuit
judges
fahy
and
washington
wrote
a
very
short
separate
dissent
in
which
they
relied
wholly
on
the
proposition
that
in
the
light
of
both
watkins
and
sweezy,
the
mandate
of
the
committee
did
not
authorize
an
investigation
of
communism
in
education.
judge
washington
who
had
--
who
had
agreed
with
the
original
decision,
he
in
the
light
of
the
sweezy
and
watkins
cases
joined
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
fahy.
now
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case
--
of
this
case
which
i
can
state
very
simply,
lloyd
barenblatt
is
not
as
perhaps
the
two
prior
cases,
a
man
active
in
current
affairs
in
which
a
committee
of
government
by
subpoena
chooses
to
learn
about
those
activities.
lloyd
barenblatt
in
the
spring
of
1954
was
drawn
out
of
the
obscurity
of
his
--
his
private
employment
as
an
instructor
of
psychology
in
vassar
college
in
new
york
by
the
searchlight
of
the
un-american
activity
committee
subpoena
which
brought
him
to
washington,
a
private
citizen
to
testify
about
his
beliefs
and
activities
while
he
was
a
graduate
student
and
an
instructor
--
a
graduate
student
and
a
--
and
a
fellow
instructing
in
the
university
of
michigan
some
four
years
before
that
in
1950.
when
he
received
the
subpoena
in
may
of
--
in
--
in
may
of
1954,
he
was
employed
as
an
instructor
in
vassar
college.
the
school
term
ended
about
may
15th,
after
he
received
the
subpoena
but
before
he
was
called
to
washington
to
testify
on
june
28th.
he
had
the
subpoena,
his
position
as
an
instructor
in
vassar
college
was
not
renewed
and
when
he
testified
on
june
28th,
he
was
unemployed.
now
when
he
came
to
the
committee
hearing
to
testify,
he
found
there
to
testify
before
him
a
man
even
younger
than
himself,
he
was
31
years
of
age
in
1954,
a
man
by
the
name
of
francis
xavier
thomas
crowley
whom
he
had
known
in
the
university
of
michigan.
mr.
crowley's
testimony,
which
begins
on
page
173
of
this
--
of
this
record,
he
opened
the
testimony
by
a
statement
--
a
statement
from
the
chairman
pointing
out
that
mr.
crowley
had
been
before
the
committee
on
a
former
occasion.
and
he
had
refused
to
answer
any
questions,
not
claiming
the
fifth
amendment,
he
just
refused
to
answer
any
questions
about
his
activities
or
affiliations
while
an
undergraduate
student
at
the
university
of
michigan.
and
he
was
unanimously
cited
for
contempt
by
the
house.
and
his
case
was
then
pending
when
he
was
called
in
june,
1954
--
he
was
pending
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office,
apparently,
just
prior
to
indictment.
now
mr.
crowley
began
his
testimony
by
saying
by
--
and
i
might
--
it
becomes
relevant
at
the
top
of
page
175,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
said
that
“the
field
to
be
covered
in
this
investigation
which
barenblatt
was
to
be
called
as
a
witness,
the
field
to
be
covered
will
be
in
the
main
communism
in
education
and
the
experiences
and
background
in
the
party
by
francis
x.t.
crowley.
now
mr.
crowley
testified
that
his
experiences
and
background
in
the
party
were
very
simply
that
in
his
first
year
in
columbia
college
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
thank
you,
your
honor.
when
the
court
rose
for
lunch,
we
had
--
i
had
reached
in
the
statement
of
facts,
which
i'll
make
very
brief,
the
place
where
the
petitioner,
barenblatt,
had
been
summoned
to
washington
for
a
hearing
and
the
hearing
which
begins
at
page
173
of
the
record.
and
the
first
witness
was
a
mr.
crowley,
whom
he
had
known
in
the
university
of
michigan.
and
mr.
crowley,
who
had
refused
to
answer
on
a
former
occasion,
came
back
to
tell
his
story
without
a
subpoena
on
this
occasion.
and
as
the
chairman
said
that
the
field
covered
will
be
communism
in
education
and
the
experiences
and
background
in
the
party
of
francis
x.t.
crowley.
now,
very
briefly,
mr.
crowley,
testified
that
his
experience
with
the
communist
party
was
that,
while
in
the
first
year
in
college
in
columbia,
he
had
lost
his
religious
faith
and
he
was
looking
around
for
another
one
and
an
older
woman,
a
member
of
the
communist
party
had
introduced
him
into
a
communist
party
and
that
he
then
served,
he
delivered
the
--
the
daily
--
the
daily
worker
and
worked
for
the
communist
party.
and
finally,
a
year
or
two
later,
after
wandering
around
in
various
jobs
within
the
--
the
university
of
michigan
undergraduate
school,
where
he
said
his
membership,
which
he
had
taken
out
in
new
york,
was
transferred
to
michigan
and
there
he
was
a
member
of
the
neophytes
club
in
the
undergraduate
school,
which
apparently
was
a
club
named
after
someone
allegedly
a
communist,
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
who
had
died
in
the
spanish
civil
war.
now,
mr.
crowley
said
that
after
he
had
refused
to
testify
and
had
been
cited
for
contempt,
he
was
working
on
a
construction
job
of
the
church.
he
was
helping
to
construct
the
church
and
in
connection
with
that
work
he
met
--
he
met
a
priest
who
told
him
he
really
ought
to
go
washington
and
tell
a
story.
so
mr.
crowley
then
undertook
to
tell
a
story.
now,
what
he
told
about
michigan
after
first
about
his
experiences
in
new
york
and
boston,
what
he
told
about
michigan
was
that
he
named
some
dozens
of
persons
who
had
been
members
of
the
neophytes
club
and
whom
he
said
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
then
he
named
a
number
of
persons
who
were
members
of
the
haldane
club
of
the
graduate
school.
the
haldane
club
of
the
communist
party
apparently
named
after
the
english
scientist.
and
among
the
names
he
gave
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
record
doesn't
show.
that
was
only
my
assumption,
your
honor,
from
some
of
the
--
mr.
haldane's
works
and
statement
that
it
was
after
the
scientist.
and
he
finally
got
around
to
naming
a
barenblatt.
and
about
him
he
said
--
very
simply,
he
said,
“he
was
a
member,
but
i
know
he's
out
of
the
party
and
that
he
has
no
--
no
further
interests
in
it.”
and
he
was
cut
short
on
that
and
they
said,
"no,
we'll
ask
mr.
barenblatt
about
that.
just
tell
us
the
names
and
if
barenblatt
is
one
of
them,
that's
all
we
want
from
you."
so
then
another
--
another
person
was
called
who
he
--
who
he
named
in
this
--
in
this
rather
long
testimony,
which
he
named
perhaps
for
more
than
a
score
of
people,
and
then
barenblatt
is
called.
there
was
no
effort
to
state
to
him
in
any
formal
way,
this
was
a
court
before
the
washington
--
decision
of
this
court.
there
was
no
effort
to
state
in
any
formal
way
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
or
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
which
were
to
be
asked
of
him.
but
he
was
asked
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
the
subpoena
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
your
honor,
you
take
me
by
surprise.
i
have
not
seen
the
subpoena.
it
was
--
i
don't
believe
made
part
of
the
--
of
the
prosecution
in
the
case.
and
perhaps
my
brother,
mr.
monahan,
will
be
able
to
help
the
court.
i'm
--
i
just
don't
know.
all
i
know
is
there's
a
subpoena
to
testify.
and
he
--
at
the
outset,
or
after
giving
some
identifying
data
about
his
age
and
where
he
had
worked
until
he
received
the
subpoena,
he
very
early
in
the
record,
stated
his
position
that
he
would
not
answer
any
questions
in
respect
to
former
membership
or
present
membership
in
either
the
communist
party
as
such
or
in
the
haldane,
a
club
of
the
communist
party
of
michigan,
nor
would
he
answer
a
question
as
to
whether
he
knew
crowley.
he
said,
"i
knew
him."
but
he
would
not
answer
as
to
whether
he
knew
him
as
a
communist.
and
the
five
questions,
indictment
questions
were,
“are
you
a
communist?”
one.
two,
"have
you
been
a
communist?"
three,
"were
you
a
member
of
the
--
rather,
are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
were
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
third,
"were
you
a
member
of
the
haldane
club
of
the
communist
party?
did
you
now
--
know
crowley
as
a
communist?"
and
the
fifth
question
on
which
he
was
indicted,
“were
you
a
member
of
some
counsel
of
cultural
--
i
have
it
here,
another
organization
which
existed
on
the
michigan
campus?"
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
record
supports
the
--
the
contention
that
he
was
present
at
certainly
--
at
some
time
during
the
hearing.
he
was
called
down
to
be
present
that
day
and
he
wasn't
told
that
he'd
be
called
for
particular
hours
so
--
and
as
the
record
--
his
own
testimony
indicates
that
he
was
in
the
--
in
the
hearing.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i'm
not
prepared
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
heard
that
question.
he
admitted
that
he
was
present
during
the
hearing
and
i
think,
it
would
not
be
an
unfair
--
an
unfair
assumption
to
say
that
he
was
present
during
this
important
part
for
him.
oh,
the
subpoena
--
mr.
monahan
is
--
is
kind
enough
to
advise
me
that
the
subpoena
appears
at
page
--
at
page
70
of
the
record."
and
commanded
to
appear
before
the
committee
and
to
testify
touching
matters
of
inquiry
committed
to
said
committee
and
not
to
depart
without
leave
of
the
committee.
there
was
no
description
of
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
in
the
subpoena.
now,
mr.
crowley,
just
before
being
asked
to
identify
these
members
of
the
haldane
club,
he
stated
and
this
appears
on
page
204
of
the
record.
in
answer
to
the
question,
what
sort
of
activities
did
the
haldane
group
engage
in?
and
he
answered,
“they
were
chiefly
of
an
intellectual
nature
discussing
things.
it
was
mainly
a
discussion
group.
there
was
very
little
of
the
activity
of
the
kind
that
the
neophytes
engaged
in,
that
was
the
undergraduate
club,
that
is
running
around
the
campus
with
petitions
or
things
like
that."
now,
when
he
refused
to
--
when
barenblatt,
the
petitioner,
refused
to
answer
the
questions,
he
tried
to
make
a
statement.
he
had
quite
a
long
statement,
10
or
11
pages
with
him,
which
he
said
explained
his
reasons.
it
was
a
good
bit
of
colloquy
back
and
forth
with
the
committee,
as
to
whether
he'd
be
allowed
to
make
the
statement
because
he
hadn't
submitted
to
the
committee
according
to
its
rules
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
but
finally,
they
allowed
him
to
put
the
statement
in
the
record
as
his
explanation
of
why
he
would
not
answer
the
questions.
and
that
statement
appears
beginning
on
page
227
of
the
records.
and
it
gives
his
reasons
for
--
that
he
felt
that
this
intrusion
on
his
personal
affairs
was
an
unwarranted
--
was
unwarranted
and
that
the
committee
did
not
have
the
authority
and
indeed
the
congress
did
not
have
the
authority
under
the
cause
of
the
first
amendment
to
authorize
this
intrusion
on
his
affairs.
now,
barenblatt
was
convicted
before
the
--
he
--
he
agreed
to
waive
a
jury
during
the
trial
and
he
was
convicted
by
--
by
the
district
court
without
a
jury,
and
given
a
sentence
of
six
months
and
a
$250
fine,
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
this
court
having
granted
certiorari,
sent
the
case
back
for
reconsideration.
now,
the
second
--
the
second
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
light
of
watkins
and
sweezy,
and
the
two
dissenting
--
these
two
dissenting
opinions
present
for
consideration
to
this
court,
petitioner
submits,
three
questions.
one,
whether
the
--
he
was
properly
advised
that
the
questions
about
his
communist
party
membership
was
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
the
second
question,
whether
congress
authorized
the
committee
to
make
an
investigation
of
communism
in
education.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
--
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
this.
he
was
called
as
the
last
witness.
there
was
no
formal
statement
by
the
committee
to
him
as
to
what
the
purpose
was.
now,
as
to
whether
he
made
a
sufficient
objection,
if
one
is
required,
all
i
can
point
your
honor
to
is
on
this
exhibit
1,
if
--
which
is
his
written
statement
accepted
by
the
committee.
if
your
honor,
will
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
228
and
the
top
of
page
229,
where
he
speaks
of
--
of
the
--
his
objection
to
being
questioned.
and
he
says,
“that
they,
the
congress,
cannot
by
resolution
increase
their
constitutional
authority
as
was
said
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
jones
case."
now,
if
he
adopted
this
language
as
his
own,
i
think
he
asked
for
an
explanation
by
the
committee
of
pertinency.
the
citizen
when
interrogated
about
his
private
affairs
has
a
right
before
answering
to
know
why
the
inquiry
is
made.
and
if
the
purpose
disclosed
is
not
a
legitimate
one,
he
may
not
be
compelled
to
answer.
now
to
answer
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
answer
you
in
all
frankness,
just
as
there
was
not
a
statement
by
the
committee
as
to
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
or
the
pertinency
of
the
question,
there
was
no
clear
statement
by
the
committee
nor
by
the
petitioner,
was
there
a
clear
objection
on
that
ground?
all
i
can
submit
to
your
honors
on
this
point,
is
that
at
this
time
in
19
--
june
28th,
1954,
before
either
witnesses
or
counsel
had
the
advantage
of
the
watkins
decision,
these
things
were
not
as
competently
or
technically
handled
as
they
were
in
later
hearings.
i
submit
that
on
this
question,
and
i
will
address
myself
to
it
very
briefly.
on
this
question
of
pertinency
that
it
was
the
committee's
obligation
to
give
him
some
kind
of
a
statement
as
to
the
nature
of
the
inquiry,
so
that
he
could
judge
at
the
peril
of
criminal
conviction
whether
he
should
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
the
first
amendment.
and
i
submit
that
the
general
statement
which
i've
read,
that
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
at
the
beginning
of
crowley's
testimony,
that
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
in
--
is
in
the
main,
communism
in
education
and
the
experiences
of
crowley
in
the
party
that
he
could
very
well
believe
that
the
--
what
the
committee's
purpose
was
--
was
to
give
crowley
the
opportunity
to
get
out
from
under
the
contempt
citation
and
to
tell
the
committee
what
he
knew
and
to
explain
his
experiences
in
the
communist
party.
and
certainly,
if
that
was
a
subject
of
the
inquiry,
as
the
chairman
at
the
beginning
of
crowley's
testimony
says
it
was,
that
it
was
not
pertinent
to
that
inquiry
about
crowley's
experiences
in
the
party
to
ask
barenblatt
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
haldane
club
as
a
communist
party
in
the
university
of
michigan.
now,
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
on
this,
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
court's
time
by
trying
to
repeat
what
the
court
--
what
the
court
said
in
the
watkins
decision.
i
might
just
leave
this
point
by
pointing
out,
recalling
to
the
court,
that
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
short
concurring
opinion
which
was
restricted
to
this
point
in
the
watkins
case.
the
statement
is
made
very
flattering,
that
the
pertinency
ought
to
be
made
clear
to
the
--
to
the
witness.
and
i
would
like
to
--
unless
the
court
have
some
questions
on
this
business
of
pertinency,
i
would
like
to
move
to
my
second
question,
which
is
whether
the
congress
has
authorized
the
un-american
activities
committee
to
make
this
investigation
of
communism
in
education.
because
i've
exhausted
the
record
on
what
--
on
what
the
committee
said
to
the
petitioner
and
the
objection
he
made
on
the
ground
of
pertinency.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
oh,
yes.
i
--
i
am
familiar
with
it.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no.
this
is
the
prior
year,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
this
was
the
opening
of
the
hearings
on
the
--
this
is
the
first
part
of
the
investigation
on
communism
in
education
in
the
prior
year.
and
it's
perfectly
plain
that
that
was
not
before
mr.
barenblatt
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
june
28th
of
1954,
a
year
and
three
months
later.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no.
now,
in
leaving
this
subject
i
should
say
this
to
the
court
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
dissenting
opinions
didn't
deal
with
this
question.
they
didn't
--
they
felt
they
didn't
reach
it.
they
went
off
on
the
second
point
i'm
coming
to.
but
the
majority
of
the
court
said
that
looking
at
the
whole
record
and
that
if
barenblatt
was
sitting
there
in
the
--
at
the
hearing
at
least
part
at
that
time,
that
he
was
aware
in
a
general
way,
at
least,
of
the
nature
of
the
investigation,
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
and
that
it
was
not
restricted
to
mr.
crowley's
adventures
in
the
communist
party,
but
that
it
was
directed
to
some
extent
to
communism
in
education
in
michigan
and
that
he
was
fairly
apprised,
and
that
he
couldn't
borrow
a
language
from
an
opinion
of
this
court
as
his
way
of
making
the
objection
of
pertinency,
if
an
objection
is
required
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement
by
the
committee.
now,
that's
about
all
i
can
help
the
court
on
that
point.
now,
if
i
may
go
to
my
second
point
which
is
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
oh,
he
--
he
had
a
counsel
--
he
had
his
counsel
with
him,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
he
did
have
counsel
with
him.
in
this
statement,
it's
obvious
from
the
nature
of
the
statement
which
is
a
legal
document
and
it
was
prepared
by
mr.
wittenberg
and
his
counsel
--
who
was
his
counsel
in
the
hearing.
that's
very
clear.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i'm
not
entirely
clear.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
there
is
some
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
by
the
chief
justice,
which
does
speak
of
the
witness
asking
what
is
the
pertinency,
but
it
has
to
be
related,
the
witness'
question
as
to
whether
there
is
enough
information
given
by
the
committee
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
at
which
the
witness
--
advising
the
witness.
these
two
things
cannot
be
examined
wholly
separately,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
my
point.
that's
entirely
my
position,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
if
the
allowable
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course,
i
understand,
your
honor.
if
the
allowable
area
that's
described
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
seems
to
counsel
as
to
the
witness
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
i
think
that
--
i
think
in
the
case
you
get
--
what
is
going
to
--
what
it
has
to
boil
down
to,
your
honor.
after
the
court
has
laid
down
the
rule,
you're
going
to
place
a
certain
--
a
certain
responsibility
on
counsel
to
understand
and
--
and
deal
with
pertinency
for
his
client.
i
don't
think
we
quite
have
that
situation
in
1954.
now,
to
the
second
question,
did
congress
authorize
the
investigation
of
communism
in
education
by
the
language
of
the
resolution
setting
up
the
un-american
activities
committee,
a
language
which
of
course,
the
court
is
entirely
familiar
and
appears
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
main
brief?
now,
without
quoting
that,
we
all
know
that
what
was
authorized
was
an
investigation
of
un-american
propaganda
activities
and
the
diffusion
in
the
united
states
of
subversive
and
un-american
propaganda.
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
here
what
the
court
said
about
the
--
the
difficult,
if
not,
impossible
vagueness
of
this
language
in
the
watkins
opinion.
i'm
going
to
contend
from
my
argument
to
say
this,
that
two
of
the
judges
below,
chief
judge
edgerton,
joined
in
by
judge
bazelon,
they
placed
their
opinion
upon
their
reading
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
watkins
case,
in
which
they
say
that
they
think
the
court
plainly,
despite
the
subsequent
discussion
of
pertinency,
stated
that
this
language
did
not
convey
any
authority
upon
this
committee
to
make
any
investigation.
certainly,
if
communist
--
certainly
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
house,
knows
how
to
use
the
word,
communism
and
the
word
education,
if
they
want
to
authorize
an
investigation
of
communism
in
education
and
certainly
they
have
not
used
this
language
here.
now,
i'm
going
to
rest
on
the
court's
opinion
on
the
watkins
case.
chief
judge
edgerton's
opinion,
i
would
like
merely
to
make
a
kind
of
an
anticipatory
reply
to
the
government's
position.
now,
how
does
the
government
deal
with
this
question?
the
government
obviously
doesn't
argue
with
the
court's
language
in
the
watkins
case
condemning
the
vagueness
of
this.
but
the
government
says;
“well,
let's
not
worry
about
the
language.
let's
look
at
what
the
members
of
congress
said
in
1938
when
this
language
was
adopted.this
language
has
been
unchanged
since
its
initial
formulation
setting
up
the
dies
committee
in
1938.
and
the
government
in
its
brief
says,
“well,
there
was
a
lot
talk
on
the
floor
of
the
house
when
this
was
adopted
by
members,
talking
about
communism.”
so,
clearly
by
un-american
propaganda
and
propaganda
instigated
from
abroad
that
attacks
the
principles
of
the
form
of
government
as
guaranteed
by
a
constitution
and
some
of
the
congressmen
mentioned
communism.
they
certainly
intended
to
include
communism.
and
that
doesn't
quite
get
education
here,
but
they
say,
“now,
we're
going
to
find
education
in
this
language
by
looking
at
the
fact
that
when
this
investigation
of
education
was
going
on
during
the
years
of
1953
and
1954,
the
committee
filed
reports
with
congress.
and
congress
made
an
appropriation
which
at
the
time
when
congress
knew
that
its
committee
was
investigating
education,
and
that
constitutes
--
that
imports
into
the
language
some
kind
of
authority
to
investigate
communism
in
education.
now,
about
all
i
can
say
about
this
is
that
you
cannot
substitute
for
the
language
of
the
resolution,
either
appropriations
by
congress
or
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
it's
true
that
if
you
have
some
language
there
that
can
be
interpreted,
you
can
use
perhaps
the
appropriations
or
the
discussions,
but
it
has
to
relate
to
the
language.
now,
i
submit
that
when
your
honors
read
the
government's
brief,
you'll
find
almost
there
is
the
substitution
for
the
language
of
the
resolution.
without
bearing
on
the
language,
the
actions
of
the
congress
in
--
in
granting
appropriations
for
this
committee
to
continue
its
work.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
i
would.
i
would
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
draw
a
very
definite
distinction
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
between
the
interests
of
the
--
of
the
federal
government
and
the
--
in
the
field
of
labor,
that
would
take
me
to
my
second
point
that
education
as
to
a
circuit
judge
fahy,
joined
in
by
judge
washington
said
that
relying
upon
language
in
sweezy,
that
if
congress
is
going
to
authorize
an
investigation
in
the
field
which
we
presume
is
--
is
reserved
generally
to
the
state,
such
as
education,
which
labor
doesn't
quite
fit
into
--
into
that
category,
that
certainly,
congress
should
be
required
to
use
some
words
which
would
indicate
that.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
i
would.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
but
of
course
that's
a
harder
case
than
this.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
recognized
institution
of
higher
learning,
the
university
of
michigan.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
think
not.
now,
i'm
going
to
leave
this
argument
about
--
that
you
cannot
rely
upon
appropriations
and
statements
by
members
to
supply
an
authority
that
is
not
in
the
words.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
they
did,
they
had
reports
that
they
read
them.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
say,
your
honor,
that
the
appropriation
can
be
used
to
give
a
meaning
to
words
in
the
resolution.
they
cannot
be
a
substitute.
you
cannot
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
all
right.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
because,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
my
position
would
be
that
the
house
can
only
give
the
committee
its
legislative
authority
to
investigate
by
passing
a
resolution.
it
cannot
do
it
by
making
an
appropriation.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no.
i
would
say
that
was
--
that
gave
no
authority
to
investigate.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
certainly
would,
your
honor.
because
where
is
the
standard?
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
agree,
your
honor.
but
i
think
this
is
our
difference.
you're
assuming
that
in
the
appropriation,
there
are
some
words
used
which
says
what
its
purposes
for.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
understand
it,
because
it
was
my
--
my
impression,
your
honor,
was
that,
when
appropriation
is
made,
they
save
so
much
money
to
help
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
un-american
activities
committee.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
completely
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
meaningless.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
but
that's
not
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
where
we
differ
--
that's
why
i
didn't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
right.
now,
the
appropriations
are
not
of
that
character.
they
don't
--
the
appropriation
language
doesn't
designate
this
field
of
investigation.
now,
i'm
going
to
leave
this
subject
that
the
--
that
the
language
is
in
--
inappropriate,
but
just
this
consideration.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
--
you
said
it
better
than
i
can
in
the
rumely
decision.
isn't
it
perfectly
fair
procedurally
that
we
should
require
a
house
of
congress
when
it's
going
to
bring
a
private
citizen
before
the
bar
of
criminal
justice.
that
it
tells
him
in
plain
language
the
field
of
investigation
which
it
has
authorized
its
committee
to
make.
shouldn't
a
private
citizen
call
before
a
committee,
be
able
to
look
at
an
authorizing
authority?
now,
it's
not
unfair
to
ask
congress
or
house
of
congress
which
like
--
like
the
judicial
branch
has
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution.
it's
not
unfair
to
say
to
the
house,
“if
you
want
to
investigate
a
delicate
area
like
education,
you
adopt
language
and
debate
the
question
and
so
that
at
least,
the
house
is
exercising
its
constitutional
responsibility.
its
decision
to
go
into
this
delicate
field,
so
there's
something
for
the
court
to
decide.
is
it
fair
for
us
to
be
here
in
1958
dealing
with
general
language
of
un-american
propaganda,
passed
in
1938?
is
it
fair
for
the
private
citizen?
is
it
fair
for
the
courts
that
with
--
at
words
being
easily
available,
that
we
have
to
speculate
as
to
whether
congress,
the
house
of
representative,
intended
in
this
language
to
authorize
a
committee
to
investigate
in
the
field
of
education?
now,
i
--
i
leave
this
question
with
the
suggestion
that
the
salutary
procedural,
judicial
rule
should
be
that
where
it
is
claimed
that
congress
has
authorized
investigation
in
such
a
field
as
education,
that
the
courts
should
require
the
authorizing
resolution
to
contain
some
reasonably
plain
language
reaching
that
result.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
and
that
is
not
here.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
i
perhaps
--
i
would
--
i
would
accept
that
your
honor.
but
what
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
i
do
have
it.
it's
on
the
bottom
of
page
306
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
of
the
record.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
at
least
with
the
use
of
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
--
i
think
--
i
understood
that
parenthetical
statement
to
really
reflect
the
kind
of
thing
your
honor
said
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
watkins,
where
on
this
very
point
which
you
restricted
your
opinion
to,
whether
--
whether
the
language
was
--
was
sufficient.
well,
you
said
that
if
and
private
citizen
is
to
be
brought
to
the
bar
of
criminal
justice,
then
clear
language
should
be
required.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
oh,
but
why
not,
your
honor?
if
the
house
un-american
--
if
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
wishes
to
call
voluntary
witnesses
and
explore
the
whole
field
of
education
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
--
if
the
professors
in
the
--
in
the
private
educational
institutions
are
willing
to
accede
to
a
voluntary
summons
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
and
--
and
i
think
that's
all
that
judge
fahy
means.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
perhaps.
but
i
think
if
your
honor
--
if
i
--
if
i
may
say
it
without
any
disrespect
that
there
is
language
in
your
own
opinion
in
washington,
there
is
--
which
--
which
said
that,
particularly
where
--
where
a
person
--
or
the
private
individual
is
being
brought
compulsory
before
the
bar
of
criminal
justice,
clear
language
should
be
required.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
and
i
think
your
honors
that
--
that
it
is
time
that
congress
has
told
that
each
should
exercise
its
constitutional
responsibility
and
not
just
sit
back
and
see
how
far
the
courts
are
going
to
go
in
allowing
a
committee
to
invade
a
field
like
this
and
then
congress
accepts
the
result.
they
too
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution
and
should
exercise
their
responsibility.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
third
question
and
that
is
--
and
my
last
question.
if
congress
has
authorized
despite
what
we
submitted
the
language
of
the
court
in
watkins,
if
congress
has
authorized
the
committee
by
this
un-american
propaganda
language
to
investigate
communism
in
education,
does
the
investigation
which
was
made,
violate
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
first
amendment?
now,
we
submit
that
it
does.
and
my
brief
argument
will
be
based
on
two
propositions
which
i
think
are
incontrovertible
because
established
by
the
opinions
of
this
court.
the
first
proposition
is
that
disclosure
of
association
of
private
persons
cannot
be
compelled
unless
the
governmental
authority
justifies
that
intrusion
into
private
affairs
by
an
overriding
public
interest.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
entirely
and
i'm
now
addressing
myself
to
the
proposition
that
the
--
the
--
that
the
language
--
the
resolution
meaning
that
investigation
of
education
as
applied
by
the
committee
in
this
case,
has
violated
barenblatt's
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
now,
in
the
last
two
cases,
we've
heard
and
i'm
not
going
to
bother
the
court
with
the
rephrasing
of
this
balance
of
public
versus
private
interests,
the
right
to
be
led
alone
versus
the
public
interest
to
know.
it's
expressed
in
the
n.a.a.c.p.
case
versus
alabama
and
the
other
opinions
of
this
court.
so,
my
brief
argument
is
based
on
that
legal
proposition
and
one
other
legal
proposition.
and
that
is
--
and
this,
of
course,
what
makes
this
case
difficult.
that
is
the
--
the
communist
party
aspect
of
it.
my
second
proposition
is
that
members
of
the
communist
party
may
advocate
communist
doctrine,
which
does
not
rise
or
descend
to
the
level
of
inciting
immediate
action
toward
overthrow
the
government
by
a
force
and
violence.
now,
i
think
that
your
honors
have
made
that
statement
in
the
yates
case
where
you've
distinguished
between
--
between
advocacy
of
doctrine.
the
distinction
is
also
stated
in
the
douds
case
and
i
think
elsewhere.
now,
i
want
to
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
agree
with
that
entirely
and
i'm
going
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
do
not.
well
i
--
what
i
do
get
out
of
yates
is
that
communist
--
members
of
the
communist
party,
we
--
we
have
no
dispute
here
that
they
may
have
some
recourse
to
the
first
amendment
and
what
i'm
going
to
try
to
apply
here
for
the
facts
of
this
case
is
as
to
whether
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
an
area
of
communist
party
member
activity,
which
is
perfected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
applying
these
two
principles,
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
from
the
record.
the
purpose
of
this
investigation
as
stated
by
the
committee
because,
if
as
we
contend,
the
committee's
position
was
that
we
are
going
to
investigate
what
communists
are
thinking
about,
what
they're
teaching
without
any
relation
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence,
if
that
was
the
thrust
and
purpose
of
the
investigation,
it
is
plainly
unconstitutional.
now,
what
does
the
committee
say
about
it?
well,
on
page
70
--
on
page
79
of
the
record,
this
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearings
on
communist
methods
of
infiltration
and
education.
the
preceding
year,
not
at
which
barenblatt
was
called,
but
in
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing,
when
they
called
their
two
principal
witnesses,
mr.
davis,
robert
gorham
davis,
and
granville
hicks,
in
the
prior
year.
and
the
committee
chairman
says
that
the
committee
is
concerned
with
the
opportunities
that
the
communist
is
equally
concerned
with
the
opportunities
the
communist
party
has
to
wield
its
influence
upon
members
of
the
teaching
profession
and
students
to
communists
who
are
members
of
the
teaching
profession.
now,
it's
our
contention
and
i'll
try
and
support
it
by
a
couple
of
other
statements.
if
this
committee
very
frankly
said
that
what
we're
going
to
investigate
in
education
is
what
the
communist
teachers
are
thinking
about,
what
they're
talking
about,
what
they're
teaching
without
any
attempted
relation
of
thought,
whether
we
like
the
thought
or
not,
but
are
any
attempt
to
relate
that
thought
to
action
against
our
government.
now,
mr.
davis,
the
first
principal
witness
on
page
91
of
the
record,
he
was
asked
by
--
by
mr.
tavener,
the
committee
counsel,
what
were
you
communist
teachers
in
the
teachers
union
up
to,
what
were
you
doing?
and
the
question
is,
"do
the
group
of
communists
who
are
working
within
the
teachers
union
sponsor
the
passage
of
resolutions
with
the
communist
party
as
a
whole,
was
interested
in
having
endorsed
or
adopted
by
various
groups?
the
witness,
“yes."
mr.
tavener,
"can
you
recall
any
specific
instance?”
mr.
davis,
“no,
i
can't,
but
they
would
have
to
do
with
the
national
political
situation
at
that
time.”
the
communist
supported
the
new
deal.
supported
the
roosevelt
administration
until
the
russian
pact
of
1939
and
many
of
them
measured
which
they
supported
where
i
think,
could
measure
as
against
anti-semitism,
against
fascism
for
minority
rights.
we
think
that
statement
also
supports
the
idea
that
this
committee
did
not
understand
the
constitutional
restrictions
on
its
investigation.
it
was
trying
to
find
out
what
communist
thought
was
being
banded
about.
now,
in
the1953
report,
which
followed
this
statement
at
the
beginning
by
(inaudible)
and
this
statement
by
mr.
davis,
the
1953
report
which
preceded
barenblatt's
testimony
also
indicates
--
page
246
for
example,
that
this
committee
entirely
misunderstood
the
first
amendment
limitations
on
its
investigative
functions.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
fine,
then
they
should
use
voluntary
witnesses,
not
mr.
barenblatt.
that's
all
i
can
--
a
short
answer,
your
honor,
to
that.
of
course
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
you
could
not,
your
honor,
under
compulsion.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
not
under
compulsion,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
any
physics
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no.
he
said,
“no.”
he
said,
“i
don't
care
to
inform
you.
i
don't
care
to
enlighten
you.”
he
says,
“my
views
of
physics
are
my
own.”
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
--
that's
right.
[laughter]
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
there's
certainly
--
there
was
language
of
this
court
which
would
--
i
think
it's
almost
meaningless
if
i
may
say
so
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
your
honor,
to
put
it
--
to
put
it
that
way.
if
the
right
of
privacy
against
what
kind
of
inclusion?
we
can't
talk
about
the
right
of
privacy
in
vacuo.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
certainly,
a
proper
purpose
of
the
whole
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
i
mean,
the
whole
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
and
i
think
the
proper
legislative
purpose,
the
judiciary
would
generously
construe
with
in
favor
of
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
of
the
coordinate
body
of
the
government.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
but
still
you
have
the
problem
of
proper
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
to
a
proper
legislative
purpose,
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
proper
legislative
purpose
cannot
be
what
communists
are
currently
thinking
about.
what
is
their
present
attitude
on
dialectical
materialism?
has
there
been
any
change
in
the
--
in
the
current
communist
thought
on
--
on
marxism
and
leninism.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
thought
it
was
the
former,
your
honor,
not
the
latter.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
i
thought
it
was
the
former.
now,
to
show
further
that
the
committee
erroneously
believed
it
had
a
right
to
go
into
purely
educational
matters
on
page
246
of
the
record,
for
example.
the
--
the
committee
is
making
its
first
report
on
education,
its
1953
annual
report.
and
it's
talking
about
mr.
davis'
testimony
and
it
says
such
a
thing
as
this.
"although
the
membership
of
dr.
davis
in
the
party
had
been
comparatively
brief
during
the
period
some
years
ago,
he
made
the
observation
that
might
be
expected
of
a
man
of
his
educational
background
and
experience,
when
he
responded
to
a
question
as
to
whether
a
communist
should
be
allowed
to
teach
in
american
universities."
i
do
not
think
we
should
allow
the
language
of
liberalism
and
democracy
to
be
used
by
those
who
would
destroy
liberalism
and
democracy.
that
is,
i
think,
the
communist
necessarily
in
universities
today
are
dishonest
in
what
they
say,
whereas
aristotle
and
plato
were
honest.
now,
what
this
committee
is
saying
is
that
communists
are
not
allowed
to
use
the
language
of
liberalism
and
democracy
because
they
don't
believe
in
it,
but,
of
course,
that's
not
true.
under
the
first
amendment,
if
they
restrict
themselves
to
the
intellectual
field
of
thoughts
in
expression
and
association.
i'm
connected
with
plots
to
overthrow
the
government.
of
course,
communists
are
allowed
to
use
the
language
of
liberalism
and
democracy.
and
under
the
first
amendment,
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
they
are
perfectly
entitled
to
be
dishonest,
intellectually
dishonest.
and
i
don't
think
that
--
that
on
--
if
the
first
amendment
means
what
it
says
from
what
--
i
believe
this
court
has
said
it
means,
they
can
be
stopped
from
being
intellectually
dishonest.
but
i
think
i
cite
this
for
the
proposition
that
this
committee
was
not
investigating
subversion.
it
was
not
investigating
attempts
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
it
was
investigating
current
communists
thought.
now,
in
the
50
--
in
the
1954
report
which
followed
barenblatt's
testimony,
for
example,
this
statement
beginning
in
the
last
four
words
on
the
bottom
of
page
265
and
the
top
of
page
266.
now,
perhaps
as
counsel,
i
--
perhaps,
this
is
not
a
--
a
choice
of
statement
i
should
make.
it
has
certain
emotional
content.
but
it
makes
my
point
very
well.
most
of
the
teachers,
the
committee
here
is
congratulating
itself
that
in
all
the
communist
teachers
that
exposed
by
just
--
by
pointing
out
they
were
--
they
--
they
were
communist,
and
so
then,
we
left
the
matter
to
the
local
community.
and
they
fired
them
all.
and
the
committee
is
congratulating
itself
in
its
second
report
that
this
exposure
of
communist
teachers,
just
because
they
were
communists,
not
because
they
were
advocating
overthrow
of
the
government,
succeeded
in
eliminating
them
from
the
teaching
--
from
the
teaching
world.
and
the
committee
says
most
of
the
teachers
called
had
been
suspended.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
bottom
of
page
265.
and
it's
contained
in
the
second
report
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
the
second
report
of
the
committee.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
it's
now
been
investigating
communism
and
exposing
them
for
two
years.
and
it
says
we've
been
getting
them
far.
most
of
the
teachers
called
have
been
suspended
or
permanently
removed
from
their
positions.
the
committee
on
un-american
activities
approved
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
bottom
of
page
265.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
bottom,
the
last
four
words.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
committee
on
un-american
activities
approves
of
this
action,
because
the
committee
has
found
that
the
delivery
of
a
student
into
the
tutelage
of
a
member
of
the
communist
party
has
been
responsible
for
the
destruction
of
thousands
of
american
homes.
it
is
horrible
enough
to
lose
13
americans
to
red
china
as
a
result
of
the
war,
especially
when
the
war
was
not
of
america's
choosing.
it
is
far
more
horrible
to
lose
one
american
to
the
communist
conspiracy
through
a
teacher
in
a
free
educational
institution
in
america.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
i
may
share
those
sentiments
as
an
individual,
that
it's
--
it's
horrible
to
--
to
have
a
student
persuaded
that
communism
and
is
a
--
it
is
the
wave
of
the
future
of
a
good
way
of
life.
but
i
also
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
for
--
it
is
not
within
the
realm
of
the
committee
of
congress
to
make
that
the
subject
of
its
investigation.
i
can't
say
i
know
what
it
means
by
saying
that
--
that
tutelage
of
students
has
been
responsible
for
destruction
of
thousands
of
american
homes.
but
i
say
this
that
if
that's
true,
if
--
if
students
have
been
convinced
by
feasible
discussion
of
communism
to
embrace
it,
that
the
first
amendment
forbids
the
congress
of
the
united
states
from
stopping
it,
we'll
have
to
find
other
ways,
we'll
have
to
meet
persuasion
with
counter
persuasion.
i
think
this
statement
makes
it
clear
that
this
committee
misunderstood
the
--
the
scope
of
its
constitutional
investigative
authority.
now,
i
have
--
we
got
much
more
time.
i
want
to
throughout
the
record,
your
honor.
i
--
i
ought
to
say
this.
i
would
explain
this
record
to
you
a
little
bit.
this
record
contains
principally
the
parts
of
the
hearings
which
are
eight
parts.
a
copy
has
been
deposited
with
the
court
of
all
the
hearings.
one
to
eight
on
this
investigation
of
--
of
the
committee,
but
this
contains
principally
the
parts
which
the
government
offered
upon
a
trial
in
the
district
court
of
barenblatt.
it
wanted
to
call
quite
properly
to
--
to
the
district
court's
attention.
the
parts
of
the
record
which
itself,
would
establish
a
legislative
purpose.
so,
it
offered
in
evidence,
two
sections.
the
first
section,
1953
hearings
and
the
1954
hearings.
and
that's
what
this
record
contains.
now,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
in
addition
to
references
from
the
record,
we
cited
on
the
references
in
the
hearings
of
set
of
which
have
been
deposited
with
the
court
and
which
i
believe
the
court
will
take
judicial
notice,
showing
other
numerous
statements
with
this
house
un-american
activities
committee,
just
made
it
plain
and
it
felt
it
had
the
entire
field
of
investigation
of
communism
in
education
without
making
any
distinction
whatever,
between
what
was
merely
thought,
expression
and
association
and
what
was
a
conspiracy
or
concerted
action
to
overthrow
our
government.
ignored
it
completely,
not
only
ignored
it,
but
devoted
itself
entirely
to
the
legal
area
and
made
no
attempt
to
tie
any
of
this
up
with
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
i
need
--
i
hardly
need
to
say
that
this
kind
of
an
investigation,
if
my
statement
is
fit
--
and
if
this
is
the
kind
of
an
investigation
that
this
committee
was
running,
i
need
hardly
labor
the
point
that
it
certainly
inhibited
freedom
of
speech
and
thought
and
freedom
of
expression.
what
is
the
committee's
idea?
is
it
--
is
it
the
committee's
idea
that
if
you
want
to
be
a
communist,
you
can
read
das
kapital
in
your
library,
but
don't
talk
to
anybody
about
it.
don't
communicate
this
--
this
dangerous
disease
to
anybody
else.
don't
join
in
any
organization
whether
you're
called
at
the
communist
party
or
the
haldane
club
to
do
this
--
to
have
discussions.
and
what
does
crowley
say?
crowley
himself
says
the
haldane
club
was
a
discussion
group.
they
were
not
activists.
they
like
to
talk
about
these
matters.
now,
obviously,
the
first
amendment
not
only
permits
you
to
read
and
think
about
communism,
but
it
permits
you
to
associate
with
other
people,
like-minded
people.
and
if
you
do
--
do
all
of
this
short
of
--
short
of
the
advocating
immediate
overthrow
of
our
government,
it's
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
as
to
the
--
the
government's
position
on
this,
i'll
just
say
a
word.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
congress
cannot
find
that
out
by
compulsory
process.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
congress
cannot
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
congress
cannot
--
congress
cannot
find
out
by
compulsory
process
how
many
people
are
thinking
and
talking
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
associating
together
because
they
--
they
want
to
explore
communism,
they
believe
in
communism,
or
they
want
to
advocate
it.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
think
that
the
--
i
--
i
would
have
to
answer,
your
honor,
that
in
my
opinion,
the
--
the
right
not
to
have
to
give
compulsory
evidence
--
compulsory
testimony
about
your
views
override
the
state's
--
the
state's
proper
objective
in
finding
out
what's
going
on.
i'm
afraid
the
state
has
to
get
that
information
from
voluntary
witnesses.
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
under
the
congress
of
the
united
states?
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well
now,
just
a
minute.
if
you're
talking
about
numbers,
yes,
i
suppose
you
could,
but
--
but
that
is
not
what
the
first
amendment
protects.
the
first
amendment
protects
the
freedom
of
thought
not
--
not
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
not
arithmetical
information.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
if
--
if
you're
talking
--
if
you're
talking
congress
finding
out
statistics,
yes.
but
they
cannot
examine
a
particular
student
or
a
particular
teacher
on
what
he
thinks
of
--
by
one
(inaudible)
or
another
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
if
he
doesn't
choose
to
answer.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
tried
to
state
it
as
i
believe
it.
the
--
in
--
in
closing,
your
honor,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
government's
justification
for
this.
i'd
see,
i
think
might
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i'll
make
it
--
a
very
short
statement,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
the
government
relies
upon
such
things
as
the
veterans
act,
which
says
we
won't
pay
a
veteran's
tuition
to
go
to
the
jefferson
school
in
new
york
or
any
other
school
on
the
--
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
and
they
rely
on
such
things
as
aids
to
education
made
by
congress
to
show
an
interest
of
congress
in
the
field
of
education.
i
wish
congress
had
a
greater
interest
in
the
field
of
education.
the
trouble
with
these
arguments,
the
veterans
act,
the
subsidies,
in
the
first
place,
they
were
not
relied
on
by
the
committee.
this
is
the
solicitor
general's
justification
of
what
the
committee
did
in
1954.
in
the
second
place,
such
a
contention
is
much
too
broad.
are
we
going
to
amend
the
constitution
and
increase
the
investigative
powers
of
committee
of
congress
by
just
sending
a
little
money
ahead
into
the
state?
surely
a
--
a
subsidy
it
doesn't
increase
the
powers
of
--
the
investigative
powers
or
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
congress.
and
thirdly,
and
i'll
end
with
this,
that
if
that's
true
that
subsidies
can
be
used
as
an
excuse
or
--
or
instead
of
the
--
that's
not
fair,
a
reason,
for
congress
to
investigate.
then
its
investigation
must
be
limited
and
cannot
extend
to
this
shut
gut
--
gun
blunderbuss
approach
of
what
the
communists
are
thinking
about.
the
investigation
would
have
to
be
more
limited
and
would
have
to
refer
to
the
purpose
of
--
for
example,
of
the
subsidy,
but
it
could
never
authorize
the
committee
to
ask
the
professors
or
the
students
what
they're
thinking
about.
now,
in
concluding
my
--
i
concluded
my
arguments,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
court
reaches
this
question,
that
it
is
high
time,
after
20
years
of
activity
by
this
committee,
or
the
committee
and
the
congress
to
be
instructed
as
to
the
limitations
on
its
constitutional
authority.
