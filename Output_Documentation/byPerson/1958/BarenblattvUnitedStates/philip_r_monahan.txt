mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
of
whether
under
the
watkins
decision,
it
was
necessary
for
a
witness
to
object
to
the
alleged
lack
of
pertinency
of
a
question
in
order
later
to
raise
the
issue
at
his
criminal
trial
for
contempt.
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question
in
the
words
of
the
watkins
opinion.
on
page
214
of
the
watkins
opinion,
the
fourth
line
from
the
bottom
and
this
portion
of
the
opinion
in
the
government's
view
contains
the
essence
of
the
holding
of
the
watkins
decision.
"unless
the
subject
matter
has
been
made
to
appear
with
undisputable
clarity,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
investigative
body
upon
objection
of
the
witness
on
grounds
of
pertinency
to
state
for
the
record
the
subject
under
inquiry
at
that
time
and
the
manner
in
which
the
propounded
questions
are
pertinent
thereto.
to
be
meaningful,
the
explanation
must
describe
what
the
topic
under
inquiry
is
and
the
connective
reasoning
whereby
the
precise
questions
asked
relate
to
it."
in
the
case
at
bar,
there
was
no
objection
by
mr.
barenblatt
or
by
his
counsel
to
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
which
he
was
asked.
mr.
ennis
has
referred
to
a
quotation
from
an
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
jones
case,
which
appeared
in
approximately
the
middle
of
an
11-page
legal
brief,
which
was
filed
with
the
committee
by
mr.
barenblatt,
in
which
he
objected
to
the
committee's
jurisdiction
under
the
first
amendment,
the
ninth
amendment,
the
tenth
amendment,
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
bills
of
attainder,
ex
post
facto
legislation
and
the
constitutional
separation
of
powers.
i
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
it
does
not
require
an
11-page
legal
brief
to
make
a
simple
objection
that
a
question
is
not
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
but
our
argument
does
not
rest
upon
that
alone.
we
submit
that
the
subject
was
--
was
in
any
event
crystal
clear.
mr.
justice
clark
had
pointed
out
that
at
the
beginning
of
these
hearings
in
1953,
chairman
velde
made
a
two
or
three-page
long
statement
of
the
--
of
the
purpose
of
the
investigation.
and
i
recommend
to
the
court
that
it
read
that
language
which
--
which
appears
in
the
beginning
of
page
73
of
the
record
and
it
will
--
it's
very
clear
from
that
just
what
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
investigation
was,
namely
communism
in
education.
now,
it's
true
that
mr.
barenblatt
was
not
present
at
that
time,
but
i
take
it
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
chairman
of
the
committee
to
repeat
that
--
the
purpose
of
the
committee
each
day
of
our
investigation
and
for
each
witness.
but
in
it,
but
--
but
further
than
that,
when
mr.
barenblatt
appeared
that
there
was
a
brief
--
a
brief
repetition
of
the
purpose
of
the
committee
when
the
counsel
for
the
committee
in
introducing
mr.
crowley
to
the
committee
--
and
mr.
crowley
testified
just
shortly
before
mr.
barenblatt,
that
the
purpose
was
to
--
to
pursue
the
committee's
inquiry
into
communism
in
education.
therefore,
these
things
that
--
to
the
government,
that
this
case
is
as
different
from
the
watkins
case,
as
black
is
different
from
white.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
like
to
suggest,
your
honor,
that
while
it
is
true
that
the
committee,
at
first,
refused
to
receive
the
statement
of
objections
on
the
ground
that
it
constituted
a
--
a
preliminary
statement,
which
had
not
been
submitted
to
the
committee
in
accordance
with
the
committee's
rules,
thereafter,
it
was
received
and
was
spread
on
the
record
--
just
to
clear
--
to
clear
up
that
point
--
it
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
--
the
committee
did
not
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
--
that's
correct
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
not
repeated
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
it
was
enough
to
raise
before
this
committee
the
issue
of
the
pertinency
of
the
question
to
the
subject
of
inquiry.
the
whole
thrust
of
that
document,
if
it
please
your
honor,
was
that
the
committee
was
out
of
bounds
in
this
whole
inquiry.
it
did
not
go
to
the
pertinency
of
the
particular
questions
which
were
asked
him
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
may
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
may
i
suggest
to,
your
honor,
though,
that
the
whole
tenure
of
that
document,
including
that
passage,
was
that
he
was
objecting
to
the
committee's
answering
him
and
asking
him
any
questions
at
all.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
but
--
but
not
on
the
grounds
of
pertinency
to
the
subject
under
inquiry,
sir,
is
my
point.
he
was
addressing
himself
to
the
--
to
the
power
of
a
committee
in
this
field.
now,
the
--
the
government
does
not
read
watkins
as
having
declared
the
authorizing
resolution
of
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
as
being
totally
invalid
to
support
the
compulsory
use
of
process
in
--
in
any
kind
of
a
case.
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
court
had
--
if
that
were
the
holding
of
the
watkins,
we
would
all
be
wondering
what
we're
doing
here
today,
because
barenblatt's
conviction
could
not
stand
up
anymore
than
watkins,
if
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court.
and
furthermore,
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
surely
this
court,
if
it
was
making
such
a
far-reaching
decision
as
that,
would've
said
so
in
so
many
words,
because
that
would
have
nullified
the
charter
of
the
house
un-american
activities
committee.
it
couldn't
hold
anymore
hearings
such
a
--
a
far-reaching
and
important
decision
as
that
certainly
would
be
made
clear
and
in
plain
terms.
the
actual
holding
of
the
case
is
what
i
suggested
a
few
moments
ago
and
we
read
the
watkins
language
directed
to
vagueness
and
to
the
vagueness
and
imprecision
of
the
--
of
the
charter
as
being
relevant
to
the
question
of
what
means
watkins
had
of
ascertaining
the
subject
of
inquiry.
that
--
the
court
points
out
in
its
--
in
its
opinion
that
the
subject
of
inquiry
can
be
garnered
from
several
sources.
the
authorizing
resolution,
the
remarks
of
the
chairman
and
not
the
whole
tenure
of
the
questions,
and
it
was
--
it
was
with
reference
to
the
--
to
that
--
to
the
use
of
the
resolution
for
that
purpose,
that
as
we
read
the
watkins
opinion,
the
court's
remarks
were
addressed
with
regard
to
vagueness.
if
i
can
assume
that
the
question
of
the
un-american
activities
committee's
charter,
the
validity
of
it
is
still
open,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
accepting
the
language
of
the
watkins
opinion
that
the
language
of
the
resolution
is
vague
and
imprecise
nevertheless,
that
language
does
not
come
before
the
court
in
its
bare
terms
alone,
but
with
the
gloss
of
a
lengthy
legislative
history
which
shows
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
the
house
in
setting
up
this
committee
was
to
investigate
two
--
two
things,
the
german-american
bund
back
in
the
1930s
and
the
communism.
and
for
that
reason,
even
though
looking
at
the
bare
language
of
the
resolution
alone,
it
must
be
admitted.
under
watkins,
we
have
been
taught
by
watkins
that
it
is
vague
and
imprecise.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
--
that
the
bare
language
alone
is
not
before
the
court,
but
it
has
this
clause
of
this
legislative
history.
now,
the
dissenting
--
the
dissenting
judges
below
thought
that
this
page
should
be
disposed
of
on
the
ground
--
and
which
rumely
was
disposed
of
by
the
court,
namely
a
narrow
reading
of
a
committee's
authorizing
resolution
in
order
to
avoid
delicate
constitutional
issues.
but
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
rumely
case
is
that
in
rumely,
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
house
intended
its
committee
to
go
into
the
particular
phase
of
lobbying
activities,
which
that
case
involved.
and
since
the
court
thought
that
the
particular
phase
of
lobbying
activities
which
that
case
involved
raised
grave
constitutional
issues
and
since
there
was
no
way
of
--
of
knowing
that
the
house
intended
its
committee
to
go
into
that
field,
it
--
it
read,
it
interpreted
the
resolution
as
excluding
these
difficult
areas
and
as
being
limited
to
lobbying
activities
in
the
narrower
sense
of
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
particular
issue
that
i'm
addressing
my
argument
to
now,
sir,
is
whether
or
not
the
committee's
authorizing
resolution,
authorized
it
to
inquire
into
communism
in
education,
that's
the
point,
in
education.
and
that
is
the
point
of
the
dissenting
judge's
dissent
below
that
it
should
--
it
should
be
read
as
not
authorizing
the
committee
to
go
into
this
phase
of
communism,
because
it
raises
delicate
constitutional
issues
they
thought.
now
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
sir.
i
think
if
you
read
the
dissenting
judge's
two
opinions,
there
--
there
were
two
dissenting
opinions.
but
both
of
them
agreed
on
this
--
on
this
aspect
of
it
that
the
authorizing
resolution
to
avoid
delicate
constitutional
issues
should
be
read
as
not
authorized
in
the
committee
to
go
into
the
general
subject
of
communism
in
education.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
on
the
subject
of
education?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
--
no,
sir.
just
--
just
as
there
is
nothing
in
the
resolution
which
bears
upon
the
subject
of
labor?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
at
the
time
--
what
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
at
the
time
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
at
the
time
of
the
original
passage
of
the
dies
resolution?
no,
sir,
nor
in
the
subsequent
re-passing
--
reenactment
of
the
resolution.
but
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
in
subsequent
reports,
yes.
in
the
--
in
the
report
which
the
--
which
the
committee
submitted
to
the
house
following
its
inquiring
into
this
field,
it
fully
developed
what
it
had
gone
into
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
the
--
the
general
inquiry
into
communism
in
education
of
which
of
this
was
a
part,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
may
i
correct
myself,
sir?
this
report
that
i
have
reference
to
was
--
was
--
was
made
at
the
beginning
of
1954
after
the
committee's
first
year
of
inquiry
into
this
field.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
if
the
resolution
--
the
resolution
has
been
passed
at
the
beginning
of
each
session
of
the
congress,
sir,
since
1938.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
they
reenacted
--
they
readopt
it.
but
more
important
than
that,
sir,
is
this,
that
two
months
--
less
than
two
months
after
the
most
recent
enactment
of
the
resolution
in
1953,
to
wit,
on
february
24th,
1953,
which
was
on
the
literal
eve
of
the
--
of
the
beginning
of
this
series
of
public
inquiries
into
education,
they
--
the
day
before
they
began,
there
was
an
extended
debate
on
the
floor
of
the
house
in
connection
with
appropriations
for
the
committee.
the
--
the
--
the
resolution
for
the
appropriations
asked
the
$300,000
of
funds
to
continue
the
committee's
inquiry.
and
in
the
course
of
that
debate
and
it's
all
set
out
in
our
brief
and
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
the
details
of
it,
the
--
the
desirability
of
going
into
this
field
was
threshed
back
and
forth
and
the
pros
and
cons
were
discussed.
and
assured
of
the
matter
is
that
it
was
made
crystal
clear
to
every
member
of
the
house
that
the
committee
not
only
was
--
had
actually
begun
its
inquiry
in
executive
session
and
was
about
to
continue
its
inquiry
in
public
sessions
throughout
the
country.
and
following
the
debate,
the
appropriations
were
voted
by
the
overwhelming
vote
of
315
to
2.
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
this
case
cannot
be
disposed
of
on
the
ground
of
rumely
in
the
light
of
that
legislative
history.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
--
i
think
it
is,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
for
--
for
this
reason
that
this
inquiry
was
into
communism
in
education,
but
into
communism.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
in
one
--
one
area
of
the
communist
problem
in
this
country.
and
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
1938,
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is,
sir,
for
this
reason,
in
the
rumely
case,
the
question
was
as
to
what
was
the
meaning
of
lobbying.
that
--
that's
what
the
issue
was.
what
does
lobbying
mean?
does
it
mean
--
is
it
limited
to
direct
approaches
to
congressmen
or
does
it
include
the
--
the
saturation
of
the
thinking
of
the
public
so
that
in
that
indirect
way,
the
--
the
views
will
be
--
will
be
brought
home
to
the
congressmen
by
the
selling
of
books
and
so
on
if
you
remembered.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
no,
because
here,
the
--
the
only
question
is,
does
it
--
does
the
resolution
authorize
inquiries
into
communism?
and
--
and
there
--
and
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
basis
for
a
--
a
splitting
of
the
term,
"communism”
into
--
there's
no
question
what
communism
means,
as
to
what's
in
the
--
in
the
rumely
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
being
an
active
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
i
think.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
there
is,
sir,
but
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
i
do
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
what
i
--
what
i
mean
though,
sir,
is
there's
no
difference
in
the
meaning
of
communism
with
reference
to
education
as
distinguished
from
labor,
the
government
and
the
military.
it's
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
it
would,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
is
great
constitutional
problems
undoubtedly
would
arise
there.
but,
i
think
that
--
when
--
when
congress
--
when
the
house
told
it's
committee
that
it
wanted
to
go
into
un-american
activities
committee,
un-american
activities,
which
we
are
for
present
purposes,
equating
to
communism,
then,
it
means
communism
in
every
facet
of
a
national
life
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
--
for
cutting
up
and
saying,
“it's
all
right
to
go
into
this
field,
but
not
into
that
field.”
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
there
had
been
some
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
activity
in
that
area.
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it's
not
in
this
record,
but
might
just
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
i
wasn't
--
i
wasn't
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
to
distinguish
between
religion
and
education
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
but
between
religion
and
education
on
the
one
hand
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
of
the
--
essentially
the
same
question
would
be
raised.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
perhaps
religion
would
point
up
the
issue
a
little
bit
more
strongly
than
education,
but
i
think
that
--
i
would
say
that
they're
essentially
the
same.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
and
religion
is
referred
to
specifically,
but
--
but
speech
and
assembly
is
two
which
we
--
which
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
you
--
you're
now
ask
me
under
the
charter?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
constitution
--
constitutional
questions
aside.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
see
no
--
no
base.
i
don't
think
that
the
problem
of
going
to
communism
can
be
evaded
by
holding
him
in
a
church,
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
now,
i
now
turn
to
the
constitutional
issue,
which
boiled
to
it's
essence
is
as
the
government
sees
at
this,
can
a
committee
of
the
congress,
consistently
with
the
first
amendment
exact
an
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
a
witness,
a
teacher
in
an
inquiry
into
communism
in
education,
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
i
want
to
emphasize,
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
--
or
ever
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
because
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
the
--
the
first
two
counts
of
the
indictment
were
based
upon
the
present
and
past
membership
in
the
party.
the
third
count
was
based
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
mr.
barenblatt
had
been
a
member
of
the
haldane
club
--
not
a
university
club.
the
haldane
club
of
the
communist
party,
it
was
an
integral
part
of
the
communist
party.
and
therefore,
as
the
government
sees
it,
the
whole
point,
the
whole
object
of
the
haldane
club
questioned
was
the
fact
that
it
was
part
of
the
communist
party.
and
the
fourth
question
was
whether
or
not,
he
knew
francis
crowley
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
i
want
to
point
out
in
passing
here,
that
this
was
not
a
question
does
--
asking
mr.
barenblatt
to
inform
on
someone
because
mr.
crowley
had
to
--
mr.
barenblatt's
certain
knowledge
publicly
acknowledged
a
few
moments
previously
or
an
hour
or
so
previously,
at
that
--
on
that
day
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
therefore,
by
answering
that
question
affirmatively,
he
would
not
be
informing
or
pitching
on
somebody.
now,
while
some
light
will
be
shed
on
the
proper
resolution
of
this
issue
by
a
consideration
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
i'm
going
to
turn
to
the
precedents
in
a
moment,
it
is
the
government's
belief
that
the
decision
of
the
question
requires
examination
and
final
analysis
of
fundamentals.
and
so
with
the
court's
lead,
i
should
like
to
devote
the
next
few
moments
to
a
review
of
some
of
these
fundamental
points,
which
in
the
government's
view
are
relevant.
this
court
knows
judicially
that
there
exists
and
has
for
some
decades
existed
what
has
been
described
by
the
congress
in
the
internal
security
act
as
a
world
communist
movement
whose
purpose
it
is
by
treachery,
deceit,
infiltration
and
any
other
means
deemed
necessary
to
establish
a
communist
totalitarian
dictatorship
throughout
the
world.
this
court
knows
judicially,
secondly,
a
prime
objective
of
this
movement
having
its
headquarters
in
the
u.s.s.r.
is
the
destruction
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
free
governments
everywhere.
this
court
judicially
knows,
thirdly,
that
following
two
decades
during
which
the
newly
emerged
communist
dictatorship
of
the
u.s.s.r.
seemed
too
preoccupied
with
his
own
domestic
problems
to
pose
any
serious
or
immediate
threat
to
the
united
states
and
following
another
period
of
four
years
during
which
by
an
accident
of
history,
the
western
democracies
and
the
communist
dictatorship
found
themselves
with
in
partnership
against
a
common
foe.
the
government
of
the
united
states,
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
awoke
to
a
realization
of
the
full
dimensions
of
the
danger
which
confronted
it
in
an
atomic
era
at
the
hands
of
this
late
ally
of
expedience.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
these
are
some
--
my
own
notes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'm
--
i'm
asking
the
--
i'm
asking
the
court
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
these
are
my
own
notes,
sir,
which
i'm
asking
--
which
i
suggest
to
the
court,
it
should
take
judicial
notice
of.
fourthly,
since
the
second
world
war,
that
this
government,
at
last
fully
aware
of
the
peril
in
which
it
found
itself,
has
appropriated
from
its
material
resources
and
substance,
unprecedented
sums
for
the
purpose
of
girding
itself
against
the
good
prospect
of
attack
and
defeat
at
the
hands
of
this
foe.
fifthly,
this
court
will
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
three
perilous
years,
from
1950
to
1953,
the
cold
war
broke
out
into
armed
conflict
with
american
casualties
numbering
in
the
scores
of
thousands.
sixthly,
throughout
the
uneasy
years,
since
the
second
world
war
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
these
are
some
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
--
i
am
suggesting
that
the
court
should
take
judicial
knowledge
of
these
facts
of
history,
sir,
of
recent
history.
throughout
the
uneasy
years
since
world
war
ii,
the
foremost
and
never
ending
concern
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
which
jointly
with
the
executive,
the
constitution
commits
the
responsibility
of
preserving
and
maintaining
the
nation's
physical
security
has
been
the
search
for
effective
legislative
tools
of
coping
with
this
unprecedented
menace
to
our
physical
safety
and
way
of
life.
and
finally,
to
state
the
matter
in
the
most
conservative
way
possible,
this
court
knows
judicially
that
there
are
at
least
the
gravest
of
reasons
for
the
congress
to
believe
that
there
exists
within
our
borders
an
organization
calling
itself
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
which
is
in
fact,
but
the
domestic
instrumentality
of
the
communist
dictatorship
headquartered
in
the
u.s.s.r.
an
organization
which
under
the
cloak
and
style
of
the
domestic
political
party,
secretly
seeks
to
foster,
in
every
way
possible,
the
political
and
other
ends
of
the
soviet
based
dictatorship
to
which
it
bears
allegiance.
on
the
true
nature
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
no
one
has
spoken
with
more
admirable
clarity.
in
my
opinion,
with
mr.
justice
jackson,
whom
no
one
will
accuse
of
having
been
credulous
or
an
alarmist
on
this
subject
in
american
communications
association
versus
douds
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
was
the
views
of
mr.
justice
jackson,
sir.
his
--
his
own
views,
but
i
commend
them
to
the
court
on
their
merits.
from
information
before
several
committees,
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
"and
from
facts
of
general
knowledge,
congress
could
rationally
conclude
that
behind
its
political
party
façade,
the
communist
party
is
a
conspiratorial
and
revolutionary
junta
organized
to
reach
ends
and
to
use
methods
which
are
incompatible
with
our
constitutional
system.
its
goal
is
to
seize
powers
of
government
by
and
for
a
minority,
rather
than
to
acquire
power
through
the
vote
of
a
free
electorate.
it
purposes
forcibly
to
recast
our
whole
social
and
political
structure
after
the
muscovite
model
of
police
state
dictatorship.
it
is
designed
--
mr.
justice
jackson's
opinion
continues,
to
undo
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
constitution
and
our
bill
of
rights
and
overturn
our
system
of
free
representative
self-government.
the
violent
and
undemocratic
means
are
the
calculated
and
indispensable
methods
to
attain
his
goal.
it
is
a
secret
conclave.
members
are
admitted
only
upon
acceptance
as
reliable
and
after
indoctrination
in
its
policies
to
which
the
member
is
fully
committed.
each
member
pledges
unconditional
obedience
to
party
authority,
adherence
are
known
by
secret
or
code
names.
they
constitute
cells
in
the
factory,
the
office,
the
political
society
or
the
labor
union
for
any
deviation
from
the
party
line
they
have
purged
and
excluded,
it
more
over,
mr.
justice
jackson
opinion
continues,
alone
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
is
the
end
of
it,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
was
on
the
last
time
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
was
on
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
just
have
a
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
was
on
the
last
sentence,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
and
--
and
this
goes
to
the
crux
of
it.
and
be
that
so
important
i
would
like
to
read
it.
"it
moreover
he
said,
alone,
among
american
parties,
past
or
present,
is
dominated
and
controlled
by
a
foreign
government.
it
is
a
secret
party
which
to
the
threat
of
civil
disorder
ends
the
threat
of
betrayal
into
alien
hands.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think,
i
remember
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
i
remember
that
the
opinions
which
he
refers
there
and
it
was
with
reference
to
someone
who
is
a
member
of
the
party
years
ago
and
the
court
pointed
out
rightly
that
these
were
the
views
of
mr.
justice
jackson,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
these
--
that
these
view
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
--
their
views
do
not
necessarily
differ
from
the
views
of
the
court
in
the
douds
case.
the
court
did
not
--
there
was
no
dissent
from
these
--
from
these
views.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
they
would
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes.
entitled,
i
think,
to
the
consideration
of
the
court
and
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
dissent
--
it
was
not
a
dissenting
opinion.
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
concurring
opinion.
it
was
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
to
be
exact.
pertinent
too,
to
this
subject,
is
a
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses
before
this
committee
who's
--
call
himself
a
former
member
of
the
party
who
said
that
in
his
opinion,
every
member
of
the
communist
party
is
either
actually
or
potentially
an
agent
of
the
soviet
union.
the
congress
does
--
has
reasons
for
believing
that
there
exists
within
our
borders
a
fifth
column
and
as
true
assents
as
the
fifth
column
of
general
mola
at
the
siege
of
madrid.
and
how
is
all
this
relevant?
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
chief
justice,
you
want
to
know
how
was
all
this
relevant
in
the
issue
before
this
court?
i
suggest
that
it's
relevant
in
two
ways.
first,
it
refused
the
view
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
petitioner's
case
and
the
amicus
case
that
the
communist
party
is
after
all
just
another
political
party,
and
that
if
this
question
can
be
asked
of
a
witness,
are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
then
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the--
the
committee
from
asking,
are
you
a
member
of
the
democratic
party,
or
the
republican
party
or
the
socialist
party
or
the
progressive
party.
and
secondly,
these
--
these
facts
of
history
which
i
have
referred,
teach
or
should
teach
that
this
court,
in
weighing
in
the
balance
against
the
command
of
the
first
amendment
which
is
its
--
which
it
is
its
solemn
duty
to
enforce
the
actions
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
its
duly
constituted
committees
in
their
effort
to
cope
with
and
find
adequate
legislative
tools
to
deal
with
this
communist
problem,
must
avoid
a
stellar
or
doctrinaire
approach.
it
must
meet
the
problem
with
a
keen
realization
that
it
is
congress'
and
not
this
court's
responsibility
to
find
the
legislative
means
for
--
for
dealing
with
this
danger
and
that
in
finding
such
legislative
tools,
it
must
not
be
encased
in
a
straightjacket.
it
would
be
easy,
this
court
said,
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
speaking
for
mr.
justice
jackson,
here
he
was
speaking
for
the
court.
for
those
of
us
who
do
not
have
security
responsibility
to
say
that
those
who
do
are
taking
communism
too
seriously
and
overestimating
its
danger.
we,
in
our
private
opinions,
need
not
concur
in
congress'
policies
to
hold
its
enactments
constitutional.
judicially,
we
must
tolerate
what
personally,
we
may
regard
as
a
legislative
mistake.
to
turn
in
to
the
immediate
issue
before
us,
once
at
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
for
this
committee
to
ask
mr.
barenblatt,
whether
or
not,
he
was
or
rather,
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.petitioner
was
not
queried
concerning
his
opinions
or
teachings,
or
studies.
he
was
not
subjected
to
an
inquisition
into
his
views
on
the
china
situation
or
the
north
atlantic
treaty
organization,
or
any
other
matter
of
controversy.
he
was
asked,
if
he
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
only,
it
is
submitted,
if
this
question
is
equated
to
a
query
as
to
his
membership
in
a
conventional
political
party,
cannot
be
said
that
the
committee
trespassed
on
forbidden
ground.
but
it
may
be
asked,
what
was
the
congress
and
its
committee
doing
in
the
field
of
education?
of
course,
it
can
examine
into
the
question
of
communism
in
the
army,
in
the
navy,
in
the
air
force,
and
government
generally.
of
course,
it
can
examine
of
the
question
of
communism
in
the
labor
movement
especially
since
the
douds
decision,
but
what
was
it
doing
in
the
field
of
education?
the
government
submits,
your
honor,
that
when
it
is
realized
that
congress
annually
appropriates
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
for
such
programs
as
a
support
of
the
land-grant
colleges
and
universities,
the
army,
navy
and
air
force
rotc
programs,
the
educational
assistant
program
--
assistance
programs
of
veterans
of
world
war
ii
and
the
korean
conflict,
the
off-duty
education
program
for
the
personnel
of
the
armed
forces
on
active
duty,
the
educational
exchange
programs
under
the
supervision
of
the
state
department
and
the
widespread
university
research
contracts,
whereby
under
contracts
to
departments
of
the
government
in
the
defense
program,
utilize
the
--
the
personnel
and
research
facilities
of
the
colleges
and
the
universities
as
part
of
the
defense
effort.
and
now
under
the
national
defense
education
act
of
1938
passed
two
months
ago,
there
as
a
--
a
broad
program
of
aid
to
education
generally,
the
government
submits
that
it's
too
late
in
the
day
to
suggest
that
congress
has
no
legitimate
interest
with
the
problem
of
communists
in
the
educational
world.
the
statistics
reviewed
in
our
brief
show
that
for
the
--
the
veterans
educational
assistance
program
alone,
since
it's
beginning
through
the
academic
year
1954
to
1955,
a
total
of
over
$17
billion
were
appropriated.
truly,
it
seems
to
the
government,
congress
has
the
most
lively
interest
in
communism
in
education.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
agree,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
agree,
sir,
that
congress
is
very
weary
to
trace
into
the
educational
world,
generally.
but
we
are
here
concerned
not
with
going
in
to
education
generally,
but
with
communism
in
education
and
to
suggest
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
--
it
is
not
necessary
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
bears
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
adopt
the
position
to
use
the
colloquial
phrase
that,
“he
who
pays
the
piper
calls
the
tune.”
in
order
to
maintain
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
say
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
take
that
position
in
order
to
maintain
that
in
the
--
in
the
light
of
this
huge
program
aid
to
education
over
the
years,
that
it
has
a
lively
interest
in
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
members
of
this
organization
to
which
i
address
my
remarks
at
some
length
perhaps
two
--
two
great
lengths
some
moments
ago,
are
whether
or
not,
members
of
that
organization
are
teaching
in
those
schools.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well
--
but
how
is
congress
going
to
know
with
what
particularity
to
enter
this
field
until
it
inquires,
until
it
investigates.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
it
--
it
did
announce
the
--
the
subject
as
the
extent
of
communist
penetration
into
the
education.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
thought
that
--
that
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
chairman
--
in
chairman
velde's
opening
statement.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
relationship
between
what
he
inquired
into.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
that
--
that
is
certainly
one
--
one
part
of
--
of
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
one
of
the
issues
before
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
--
that's
one
of
the
issues
before
the
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
--
but
i
--
i
have
left
that
issue
and
i
--
and
now
i'm
--
i'm
now,
addressing
to
the
constitutional
issue
on
the
assumption
that
the
committee
did
have
that
authority
from
its
--
from
the
house.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
where?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
--
he
taught
at
two
schools
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
that
the
record
indicates.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
when
he
was
subpoenaed,
he
was
teaching
(inaudible)
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
am
unable,
sir,
to
give
you
an
off-hand
answer
to
that
question.
but
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
there
are
not
some
federal
funds
used
at
that,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
certainly,
i
can
say
this
to
your
honors,
that
it
indirectly
supports
that,
at
least
to
this
extent,
that
all
contribution
as
to
that,
sir,
are
deductible
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
that,
sir,
but
i
--
i
think
that
mr.
justice
black's
question
was
--
i
--
maybe
it's
the
unwarranted
inference.
i
think
that
your
point
was
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
--
and
the
questions
what
she
was
asked
about
were
not
about
--
were
about
those
activities
at
the
university
of
michigan.
and
i
can
assure
your
honor
that
there
have
been
federal
funds
used
at
the
university
of
michigan.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'm
now
on
the
constitutional
issue,
sir.
i've
--
i've
left
the
issue
of
whether
or
not,
the
resolution
should
be
construed
to
cover
this
field.
my
remarks
for
the
past
20
or
30
minutes
have
been
--
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
assuming
that
the
house
did
authorize
its
committee
to
go
into
this
field
whether
or
not
it
was
constitutionally
empowered
to
do
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
faces
a
basis
of
interest
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
not
just
sort
of
interest.
and
you
say
it's
made
many
times,
i'm
sure
that
it
has
been
because
it
seems
so
sound
that
i'd
be
very
surprised
that
it
hasn't
been
made
often,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
nor
is
the
congressional
interest
limited
to
inquiring
into
whether
the
university's
lecture
halls
are
being
used
as
sounding
boards
for
the
propagation
of
foreign
orientated
points
of
view.
with
the
advent
in
recent
years,
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
of
these
very
wildly
prevalent
contract
programs
whereby
the
defense
agencies
of
the
government
utilize
the
personnel
and
the
research
facilities
of
the
colleges
and
universities,
a
very
pressing
and
delicate
problem
has
been
the
matter
of
personnel
security
clearance
of
the
teachers
of
these
schools
who
are
engaged
in
this
program
of
contract
research.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
you're
absolutely
correct,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
absolutely
correct,
sir.
this
problem
of
the
personnel
security
clearance
of
the
teachers
engaged
in
these
--
in
these
research
programs
as
part
of
a
national
defense
is
certainly
a
matter
of
the
keenest
interest
to
the
congress
and
the
records
of
the
hearings
involved
in
this
case
reflect
the
emphasis
which
the
committee
placed
upon
the
phase
of
its
inquiry.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
furthermore,
the
government
submits
that
it
is
not
without
significance
that
there
is
already
on
the
statute
books
of
the
united
states,
a
provision
affecting
the
field
of
education
and
communism
which
was
adopted
in
1952
as
part
of
the
veterans
readjustment
assistance
act
of
that
year,
which
incorporated
in
large
part,
one
of
the
recommendations
of
this
committee.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
recommendation
of
this
committee
in
question
was
made
much
earlier.
it
was
made
in
1941
and
this
was
not
adopted
until
1952.
but
i
submit
that
it
nevertheless
refutes
at
least
pro
tanto
the
argument
that
this
committee
is
not
--
is
not
interested
in
legislation
but
only
in
exposing
for
the
sake
of
exposure.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
--
the
original
dies
committee
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
of
--
of
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
the
practice
had
been
that
a
subcommittee
maybe
named
from
time
to
time,
by
the
chairman.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i'm
not
sure
of
--
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
my
--
my
recollection
is
that
it
may
have
been
set
up
on
the
day
of
this
--
on
the
day
of
this
hearing.
because,
you
--
your
honor,
you
may
notice
in
reading
the
record
that
from
time
to
time
chairman
velde
will
say,
“i
--
i
now
appoint
a
committee
--
a
subcommittee
of
so
and
so
for
present
purposes.”
but
it
is
argued
that
an
investigation
of
this
type
is
so
pregnant
with
the
possibility
of
abuse.
that
it
should
be
curved
by
this
court.
can
a
congressional
committee's
power
of
inquiry
and
to
educate
communism
in
education
be
abused?
of
course,
it
can.
a
congressional
committee's
power
of
inquiry
into
any
subject
can
be
abused.
and
i
hold
no
brief
for
such
tactics
as
witness
baiting
and
exposure
--
for
exposure's
sake
without
any
reference
to
any
valid
legislative
purpose
and
other
abuses.
but
no
principle
is
more
firmly
embedded
in
our
jurisprudence
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
possibility
of
the
abuse
of
a
power
is
no
argument,
whatever,
against
its
existence.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
congressional
investigations
have
led
to
the
abuse
of
power
in
the
past
or
where
other
committees
have
been
guilty
of
the
abuse
of
power,
or
whether
this
committee
may
have
been
--
this
committee
or
members
thereon,
may
have
been
guilty
of
the
abuse
of
power
in
other
instances.
this
court
must
look
to
this
record
to
determine
whether
in
this
instance
and
on
this
occasion,
this
committee
was
empowered
to
ask
and
demand
answers
to
the
questions
which
were
asked
of
this
witness.
petitioner
and
the
amicus
will
conjure
up
what
might
be
referred
to
as
horrible
examples
of
what
can
happen
and
what
has
happened
in
the
past
in
the
course
of
congressional
inquiries
into
communism?
the
enforced
naming
of
names
is
wrote
on
and
some
at
length
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
after
the
witness
says
--
answer
that
it
was
or
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
often
the
next
question
is,
who
else
do
you
know
that
was
in
there?
without
meaning,
in
anyway
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
perfectly
legitimate
for
a
committee
to
demand
other
witness
who
admits
his
own
present
or
past
membership
in
the
communist
party
that
he
named
his
associates.
it
is
to
be
emphasized
and
insisted
upon
that
legitimacy
of
such
a
follow-up
question
is
not
involved
here.
the
questions
asked
of
petitioner
must,
in
other
words,
be
looked
at
and
the
--
and
the
legitimacy
of
their
asking
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
them
alone
and
the
record
in
this
case.
i
turn
now,
briefly,
to
the
precedence
which
i
think
have
a
bearing
upon
this
issue.
in
garner
versus
the
los
angeles
board
of
public
works,
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth,
for
the
city
of
los
angeles
to
demand
of
its
public
municipal
employees
as
a
condition
of
their
continued
employment
that
they
execute
affidavits
stating
whether
or
not,
they
were
--
or
ever
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
and
if
so,
to
state
the
period
of
their
membership.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is
true
that
in
garner,
the
public
body
involved
was
a
--
the
city
of
los
angeles
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporating
the
first.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
this
is
the
first,
but
they
are
equivalent.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
i
--
[laughter]
i
--
i
am
really
surprised
to
hear
that,
sir.
because
as
i
--
as
i
read
the
opinions
of
this
court,
i
thought
that
it
had
been
settled.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
--
there
maybe
some
decisions
which
i
have
missed
in
the
last
few
weeks,
but
as
i
read
the
[laughter]
--
but
as
i
read
the
decisions
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
okay.
[laughter]
now
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
now,
it
is
true
that
in
garner,
the
public
body
involved
was
a
municipality
asking
the
questions
of
its
city
employees
whereas
here,
is
the
congressional
committee.
but,
and
this
is
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize,
so
far
as
the
repressive
effect
on
first
amendment
liberty
is
concerned,
the
asking
of
that
question
by
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
really
no
different
from
the
asking
of
that
question
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
public
interest
was
different
in
that
case
from
the
public
interest
in
this
case.
i'm
not
saying
it
was
any
stronger,
but
the
effect
of
the
asking
of
the
question
on
the
first
amendment
liberty
was
no
different.
and
in
adler
against
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york,
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
--
of
the
first
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth,
for
the
city
of
new
york
to
enact
the
feinberg
law
providing
for
the
promulgation
of
a
list
of
organizations
membership
in
which
would
constitute
prima
facie
evidence
of
disqualification
from
public
school
employment.
and
this
court
said
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
in
the
employment
of
officials
and
teachers
of
the
school
system,
a
state
may
very
properly
inquire
into
the
company
they
keep.
and
we
know
of
no
rule,
constitutional
or
otherwise,
that
prevents
the
state
when
determining
the
fitness
and
loyalty
of
such
persons
from
considering
the
organizations
and
persons
with
whom
they
associate.
and
only
last
term
in
the
beilan
and
the
lerner
cases,
this
court
held
in
the
beilan
case
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
for
the
board
of
public
education
of
philadelphia
to
discharge
a
teacher
from
his
position
in
the
public
schools
of
that
city
for
refusing
to
answer
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
ever
been
an
officer
of
the
communist
political
association.
and
in
the
lerner
case,
similarly
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth,
for
the
new
york
city
transit
authority
to
discharge
a
subway
conductor
from
his
position
in
a
city
subway
system
for
refusing
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
then
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
this
court
pointed
out
in
garner,
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
the
course
of
the
--
of
the
court's
opinion,
that
a
government
employee
can
be
required
under
pain
of
dismissal,
to
respond
to
inquiry
proving
into
matters
relevant
to
his
employment.
and
that
present
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
such
a
matter.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
in
all
of
these
cases
i've
been
referring
to
the
repressive
effect
upon
first
amendment
liberties
was
just
as
great
in
those
cases
as
--
as
in
this
case.
and
that
that
those
cases
were
correctly
decided,
barenblatt
cannot
be
reversed.
and
in
the
douds
case,
which
although
in
older
case,
in
some
ways
went
further
than
any
of
us
--
those
--
those
more
recent
cases,
this
court
held
that
there
was
not
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
for
congress
to
require
as
a
condition
of
any
labor
union
utilizing
the
facilities
of
the
national
labor
of
relations
board
to
file
affidavits
by
all
the
officers
of
the
union
and
of
any
international
union
with
which
it
was
affiliated
stating
what?
not
--
whether
or
not,
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
not
that.
but
that
they
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
the
government's
opinion
that
--
the
douds
decision
goes
much
further
than
the
government
asks
this
court
to
go
in
this
case
and
that
if
douds
was
correctly
decided,
a
fortiori
this
case
must
be
decided
by
affirmance.
and,
of
course,
the
lower
court
decisions
i
refer
you
to
the
barsky,
josephson
and
long
line
of
lower
court
decisions
which
have
held
that
there
is
no
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
in
asking
this
question.
as
mr.
--
as
judge
prettyman
said
in
the
barsky
case,
if
congress
has
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
subjects
of
communism
and
the
communist
party,
it
has
power
to
identify
the
individuals
who
believe
in
communism
and
those
who
belong
to
the
party.
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
program
and
activities
that
can
in
large
measure
upon
the
character
and
number
of
their
adherence,
personnel
is
part
of
the
subject.
and
finally,
in
conclusion,
and
to
please
the
court,
i
would
remind
the
court
with
deference
and
respect
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
the
wisdom
of
this
act
of
this
committee,
but
the
power.
and
that
if
this
court,
after
consideration
of
all
of
the
considerations
advanced
in
--
by
argument
in
the
government's
brief,
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
this
committee
and
the
congress
did
have
the
power
to
exact
answers
to
this
question,
then
no
--
no
conviction
however,
firmly
held
as
to
the
unwisdom
of
this
action
should
deter
it
from
upholding
this
conviction.
thank
you.
