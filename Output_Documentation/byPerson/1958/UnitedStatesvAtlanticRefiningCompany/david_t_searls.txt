mr.
david
t.
searls
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
proceeding
as
has
been
stated
to
carry
out
the
decree.
to
carry
out
the
decree
as
it
was
written
in
december
1941.
it
is
not
a
proceeding
to
abandon,
to
modify
or
change
the
decree
in
any
respect,
but
it
is
a
motion
to
carry
out
the
decree.
and
in
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
of
course
a
court
would
have
jurisdiction
in
fact,
the
court
in
this
case
reserve
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
decree
and
in
paragraph
10
they
are
--
they
expressed
the
reserved
jurisdiction
to
modify
the
decree,
of
course,
upon
proper
motion
being
filed.
but
that
issue
is
not
involved
here.
and
of
course,
we
would
oppose
any
modification
because
we
do
not
like
a
modification
is
justified
under
of
any
facts.
now,
i
fear
for
the
great
lakes
pipeline
company
which
is
one
of
the
multiple
ownership
lines
and
it's
the
multiple
ownership
line
that
exemplifies
and
establishes
the
true
meaning
of
the
words
as
they
appear
in
paragraph
3
of
this
decree
on
page
10,
where
it
has
said
that
no
defendant
common
carrier
shall
give,
grant,
or
pay
to
any
shipper-owner
in
excess
of
its
--
its
share
of
7
percentum
of
the
valuation
of
such
common
carrier's
property.
now,
what
was
the
case
with
respect
to
great
lakes
pipeline
company
owned
by
eight
shipper-owners,
the
continental
oil
company
owns
29%.
the
mid-continent
petroleum
corporation
owns
19%,
phillips
petroleum
company
5%,
texas
company
12%,
pure
oil
company
8%.
each
of
those
owners
was
not
entitled
for
7%
of
the
valuation
but
each
was
entitled
to
its
share
of
7%
of
the
valuation.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that's
the
reason
that
word
“share”
is
in
paragraph
3
of
this
decree.
now,
this
is
only
one
of
the
multiple
ownership
lines
that
was
in
existence
in
1941
and
that
was
a
party
to
this
decree
and
to
this
proceeding
in
1941.
there
were
10
multiple
ownership
lines
before
the
court
and
it
was
essential
that
they
placed
the
word
“share”
in
this
decree
so
that
it
would
provide
that
each
shipper-owner
could
not
receive
more
than
its
share
of
the
7%,
29%
of
7%,
19%
of
7%,
5%
of
7%
or
as
the
case
would
be.
now,
the
government
tried
in
the
trial
court
to
say
that
share
relate
to
valuation.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
immediately
preceded
7%.
apparently,
they
have
abandoned
that
position
before
your
honors
but
we
pointed
out
in
the
trial
court
as
we
do
here
that
nothing
is
said
in
this
decree
about
deducting
indebtedness
or
property
attributable
to
debt
from
valuation.
but
the
decree
expressly
provides
specifically
and
precisely
what
shall
be
deducted
from
debt.
it
provides
that
the
valuation
should
be
the
latest
final
valuation
as
established
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
then
it
says
there
shall
be
conducted
from
that
valuation
depreciation.
there
shall
be
deducted
from
that
evaluation
retirements
from
the
property
account
and
also
at
this
frozen
surplus
this
excess
surplus
if
there
is
any
is
invested
in
additions
to
lines,
it
shall
be
taken
out
and
excluded
from
the
valuation,
despite
the
fact
that
that's
provided
precisely
as
to
what
shall
be
deducted.
nothing
appears
in
this
decree
about
deducting
indebtedness
or
property
attributable
to
debt
from
valuation.
but
it
clearly
provides
that
you
shall
take
the
valuation
as
established
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
well,
now
they
have
more
or
less
abandoned
that
argument
and
so
they
say,
“well,
a
creditor
has
a
share
of
the
7%
and
the
shipper-owners
as
a
class
have
a
share
of
the
7%.”
but
that's
not
what
the
decree
says.
it
speaks
of
each
shipper-owner's
share
of
the
7%.
and
further
more,
how
could
creditors
have
a
share
of
the
7%?
as
the
government
says,
the
permissible
dividends
or
7%
of
the
valuation,
creditors
have
no
interest
in
dividends.
creditors
can't
share
in
dividends
and
both
the
government
and
ourselves
agree
that
the
7%
states
the
limits
as
to
what
shall
be
the
amount
of
the
permissible
dividends
but
creditors
have
no
right
to
share
in
dividends
and
nothing
is
said
in
the
decree
about
the
creditors
having
any
interest
in
the
dividends.
and
furthermore,
it
does
not
refer
to
the
shipper-owner
as
a
class,
but
refers
to
each
shipper-owner,
and
we
submit
that
that
language
of
the
decree
is
clear
on
its
face
and
just
as
a
trial
court
said,
it
should
be
carried
out
on
in
accordance
with
the
language
and
it's
clear
on
its
face.
now,
this
investment
in
the
pipeline
company,
of
course,
is
always
carried
out
as
a
general
rule
by
the
--
by
the
oil
companies
themselves
because
they
are
the
ones
interested
in
getting
their
oil
to
the
market.
other
invertors
won't
take
the
risk.
so
when
the
pure
oil
company
and
the
sinclair
company
found
oil
out
in
colorado,
they
became
interested
in
building
this
arapahoe
pipeline
company
to
kansas
city
where
it
would
connect
with
other
lines
and
carry
this
oil
to
the
market.
other
the
investors
weren't
interested
investing
their
money
in
that
pipeline
because
the
economic
life
for
that
pipeline
was
dependable
in
the
oil
reserves.
there's
various
risk
incident
to
it.
and
furthermore,
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
was
not
interested
in
loaning
money
to
that
pipeline
company
in
the
amount
of
$26
million
until
these
two
shipper-owners
entered
into
a
throughput
agreement
agreeing
to
ship
and
transport
their
oil
through
that
pipeline
to
afford
it
sufficient
cash.
but
they'd
not
only
agreed
to
--
entered
into
a
proof
of
agreement,
they
also
provided
that
if
the
transportation
of
oil
did
not
furnish
sufficient
revenues
and
sufficient
cash,
these
two
shipper-owners
will
put
up
the
cash
to
pay
off
all
the
current
obligations
and
expenses
of
this
pipeline
company.
they
not
only
wrote,
under
wrote
the
debt
in
effect
to
the
--
to
the
--of
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company,
they
under
wrote
the
operating
expenses
of
the
pipeline
company.
and
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
this
decree
is
clear
on
its
face
and
that
it
should
be
enforced
in
accordance
with
this
plain
language.
thank
you
so
very
much
for
giving
me
this
time.
