certainly
from

up,

there's

well,
that

more

more

well
mr.

made
no

that

justice

this
case
is
presented
as
a
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
at
the
outset
either
that
at
least
i
got
the
impression
that
the
theory
of
the
government's
original
suit
was
that
any
return
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
owner
was
inherently
a
rebate.
would
you
challenge
which
the
pipelines
challenged
would
finally
agree
to
this
decree
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
quotation
from
the
--
the
shipper-owners
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
quotation
taking
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
to
not
to
infer
that
you're
suggesting
--
in
view
of
the
last
remark
you
made
a
minute
ago
that
this
disadvantages
non-shipper,
non
owner-shippers.
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
an
indirect
violation
of
the
elkins
act
as
its
operating?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
mean,
i
didn't
get
that
impression
for
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
wondering
whether
you're
suggesting
that
the
way
this
works
out
in
view
of
what
you
claim,
a
new
condition,
in
effect
there's
a
new
violation
of
the
elkins
act
fully
apart
from
the
abstract
question
whether
any
kind
of
dividend
could
constitutes
inherently
a
violation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
clear
what
the
parties
were
trying
to
do
from
your
point
of
view?
is
that
also
ambiguous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
had
a
real
difference
of
opinion.
one's
that
you
claim
--
the
government
claims
in
1941
that
you
have
a
violation
to
the
elkins
act,
that
was
disputed
and
instead
of
going
to
trial
and
fighting
it
out,
i
could
see
that
the
parties
although
they
might
think
they
were
clearly
right,
i'm
not
clear
that
they
were
--
they
were
wholly
wrong
--
i
mean
that's
not
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say,
well
let's
settle
it
in
so
many
criminal
lawsuits,
let's
settle
on
the
whole
of
the
business
firms
but
it
is
the
good
way
out,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
think
there's
--
there's
--
when
--
when
they
questioned
the
clarity
of
purpose
is
that
the
government
could
claim
that
all
dividends
they
--
payments
are
inherently
a
violation
of
the
elkins
act,
i
can
make
the
case
for
that
too
if
i
had
to.
not
a
fanciful
case
either.
and
yet
if
the
government
then
contends
to
a
decree
whereby
they
allow
in
any
event
on
some
basis
7%
dividend?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
covered,
i
mean
that's
why
i
think
the
purposes
isn't
so
complicated
that
you
should
consent,
that
the
government
should
have
consent
whatever
the
dollar
value
is
that
the
government
should
have
consented
that
that
which
he'd
claim
as
a
violation
of
the
elkins
act
is
within
monetary
limit.
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
any
payment
of
dividends
violates
the
elkins
act
directly
or
indirectly,
then
this
consent
decree
was
the
consent
of
the
--
there
should
be
such
a
violation
should
not
be
enforced
in
the
ordinary
methods
of
my
own
preferences
but
you
still
have
people
in
jail
for
violating
the
antitrust
laws
instead
of
making
paper
settlement
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
that
the
matter
that
giving
dividends
to
the
shipper-owners
constitutes
a
violation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
start
with
that
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
the
basis
of
the
government's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
too
much
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
the
whole
position.
that
would
be
the
position
if
you
make
the
claim
that
you
now
make
in
1942.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
all
good
conscience,
in
all
good
conscience,
i
find
it
hard
by
reading
the
elkins
act
which
i
thought
the
ones
i
knew
by
far
for
an
answer
to
the
question
now
before
us
in
all
their
claims,
would
you
mind
stating
how
by
careful
and
sympathetic
consideration,
and
nobody
can
have
a
more
sympathetic
attitude
towards
your
confessing.
i
haven't
had
for
great
many
years,
how
can
i
with
such
knowledge
answer
this
problem
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
will
you
please
tell
me
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
made
a
great
many
--
has
made
a
lot
carrying
each
year
to
understand
this
very
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
--
how
to
hook
that
up,
i
mean
--
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
the
act
was
passed,
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sustained
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
does
that
tell
me
what
“its
share”
means
and
how
does
that
tell
me
that
merely
the
money
investment,
is
it
the
share
in
the
enterprise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
light
that
it
shed
on
that,
not
that
it's
conclusive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
found
the
assumption
that
their
share
is
merely
the
money
share.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
--
is
that
a
self-evidence
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
is
that
a
step
economically
of
self-evidence
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
it
a
self-evidence
proposition,
that
if
there's
--
if
it
isn't,
violative
as
such
of
the
elkins
act
for
the
shipper-owner
would
have
if
there's
a
--
turn
on
his
--
his
share
in
the
enterprise,
if
his
share
means
his
monetary
investment
alone.
was
that
self
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
economic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
but
if
it
isn't
self
evidence
and
if
“its
share”
may
be
beyond
his
equity
interest,
then
maybe
beyond
his
invested
interest.
and
then
how
does
that
--
how
can
you
derive
a
purpose,
a
purpose
which
illuminates
the
meaning
of
this
concededly
dubious
term?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
someone
said
it
--
it
was
very
dubious
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
getting
interest
at
any
dividend,
that
a
dividend
has
such
as
the
government
contended
even,
of
ambulant
dividend
is
not
necessarily
or
is
not
even
this
--
cannot
be
established
as
a
violation
of
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
had
been
so
cut
short,
you
can
consider
this
as
a
decree
from
going
to
trial.
that
a
decree
is
what
result
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
that
also
explains
why
the
decree
was
phrased
there
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
lots
of
things
happened
two
weeks
after
pearl
harbor
or
can't
be
rendered
in
16
or
18
years
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
asking
a
resolution
of
what
you
concede
is
a
--
is
an
ambiguous
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
