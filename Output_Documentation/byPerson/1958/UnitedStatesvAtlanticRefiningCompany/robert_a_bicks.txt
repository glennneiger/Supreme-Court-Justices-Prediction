mr.
robert
a.
bicks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appeals
for
an
order
--
from
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court
over
the
district
of
columbia.
that
order
first
denied
the
united
states'
motion
directed
against
the
arapahoe
pipeline
company
to
carry
out
an
elkins
act
judgment
provision.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
circuit
granted
the
motion
made
by
two
other
pipeline
companies
to
construe
that
same
provision.
both
motions
post
essentially
the
same
issue
and
as
a
perhaps,
helpful
preliminary
focus
for
the
statement
of
the
case
to
come.
that
issue
maybe
simply
put
at
the
outset.
the
issue
involved
interpretation
of
an
elkins
act
judgment
provision
limiting
to
7%,
dividends
payable
by
the
bulk
of
this
country's
oil
pipeline
to
the
shipper-owners,
that
is
to
the
major
oil
company
that
owned
oil
pipelines
and
shipped
oil
over.
on
the
one
hand,
the
united
states
urges
that
the
judgment
permits
each
shipper-owner
only
a
fair
return
on
his
investment
outlay
of
his
share
in
the
pipeline's
total
capitalization.
on
the
other
hand,
defendant's
urge
and
the
court
below
agreed,
the
judgment
permits
each
shipper-owner
not
only
a
return
on
his
investment
outlay,
but
an
equal
return
on
investment
outlays
made
by
others.
that
is
on
loans
to
the
pipeline
not
by
the
shipper-owner
but
by
third
parties.
the
defendant's
construction
applied
to
the
facts
of
arapahoe
would
permit
each
of
arapahoe's
two
shipper-owners
a
more
than
70%
return
on
their
less
than
three-year
old
investment.
this
construction
issue
takes
on
the
meaning
in
light
of
a
brief,
very
brief
march
of
those
events
that
preceded
entry
of
the
elkins
act
judgment
at
issue.
the
elkins
act
recall
made
oil
pipelines
common
carriers
and
sought
to
ensure
equal
access
for
all
oil
shippers
to
oil
pipelines
at
equal
cost.
to
this
end,
the
elkins
act
barred
the
granting
or
receipt
by
or
through
any
means
or
device,
whatsoever,
of
rebates,
offsets
or
concessions
from
published
tariff
rate.
the
chief
purpose
of
the
elkins
act
that
this
court
put
it
in
the
union
pacific
case
at
pages
461
and
462
was
to
eliminate
rebates,
concessions
and
discrimination
from
the
handling
of
commerce
to
the
end
that
all
persons
and
places
might
carry
on
their
activities
on
an
equal
basis.
in
fact,
favoritism
which
destroys
equality
between
shippers,
however
brought
about
it,
is
at
an
end.
it
was
with
this
purpose
uppermost,
that
the
united
states
proceeded
under
the
elkins
act
on
december
21,
1941.
that
complaint
named
as
defendant
from
52
oil
common
carrier
pipelines
and
their
shipper-owner
parents
that
is
the
major
oil
companies
that
own
the
pipelines
and
the
27
shipper-owner
parents,
that
is
the
major
oil
companies
that
own
the
pipelines
and
shipped
oil.
the
complaint
alleged
that
although
the
oil
company
parents
were
normally
paying
published
tariff
rates,
they
were
in
fact
receiving
rebates,
offsets
or
concessions
in
the
guise
of
dividends
and
earnings
from
their
pipelines.
on
the
same
day,
that
complaint
was
filed.
the
judgment
here
at
issue
was
added.
that
judgment
in
its
crucial
portion
which,
may
i
suggest,
is
found
on
page
10,
the
middle
of
page
10
of
volume
1
of
the
record
before
you.
that
judgment,
in
its
crucial
portion,
limits
payments
by
a
pipeline
in
any
year
to
its
shipper-owner
to
its
share
of
7%
evaluation.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
matter
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
and
the
provision
goes
on
to
specify
that
dividends
paid
in
accord
with
that
limitation
formula
shall
be
deemed
permitted
insofar
as
the
interstate
commerce
and
elkins
act
is
concerned.
evaluation,
of
course,
is
defined
by
--
by
precisely
as
the
latest
final
evaluation
made
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
property
owned
and
used
for
common
carrier
purposes
by
the
oil
pipeline.
the
word,
"seven
percent"
need
no
definition.
but
undefined,
however,
are
the
words,
"its
share."
and
it's
on
the
interpretation
of
the
words,
"its
share"
that
the
controversy
before
this
court
focuses.
the
united
states'
position
is
that
the
dividend
limitation
formula,
the
words,
"its
share
of
7%
evaluation,"
were
meant
to
permit
each
shipper-owner
only
a
fair
return
on
his
capital
outlay,
his
share
of
the
pipeline's
total
capitalization.
to
this
end,
the
united
states
would
define
the
words,
"its
share,"
to
relate
not
only
to
other
stockholdings,
but
to
the
pipeline's
total
capitalization
for
a
fair
measure
of
capital
outlay
for
the
purpose
of
gauging
a
fair
return
on
capital
outlay,
must
relate
not
only
to
other
stockholding,
but
to
the
entire
bundle
of
investors
rights,
whether
labelled,
equity
or
debt,
which
make
up
the
pipeline's
capitalization.
defendants,
on
the
other
hand,
urge
and
the
court
below
agree
that
the
dividend
limitation
formula,
the
words,
"its
share
of
7%
evaluation,"
permit
each
shipper-owner
a
return
not
only
on
his
capital
outlay,
but
an
equal
return
on
capital
outlays
made
by
others
that
is
on
loans,
to
our
pipelines,
not
by
the
shipper-owner,
but
by
third
parties.
to
this
end,
defendants
would
define
the
words,
"its
share,"
to
relate
only
to
other
stockholdings
in
the
pipeline.
as
a
result,
as
soon
as
the
pipeline
increases
its
capitalization
by
borrowing
from
a
third
party
permissible
dividends
to
the
shipper-owners
jump
immediately
and
precise
proportions
of
the
money
borrowed
by
the
pipeline
from
third
parties.
this,
despite
the
fact
that
the
increase
in
capitalization
stands
from
no
new
capital
outlay,
no
new
out-of-pocket
capital
contribution
by
the
shipper-owners.
i
think
one
brief
factual
or
hypothetically
should
draw
clear
the
difference
between
the
two
constructions
before
this
court.
assume,
two
oil
companies
set
up
a
pipeline,
assume
further
that
each
of
the
oil
companies
owns
half
the
stock
of
the
pipeline
and
assume
finally
that
the
pipeline
incurs
no
debt.
in
these
circumstances,
both
parties
agreed
that
each
shipper-owner's
permissible
dividend
would
be
equal
to
one-half
that
is
the
share
of
its
stockholdings
--
of
the
total
stockholdings
in
the
pipeline
of
7%
evaluation.
however,
as
soon
as
the
pipeline
incurs
debt,
the
difference
in
the
two
constructions
becomes
significant.
assumed
to
carry
on
with
our
hypothetical
that
the
pipeline
owned
equally
by
two
oil
companies
incurs
that
as
did
arapahoe
equal
roughly
to
eight
times
the
value
of
the
stock
bought
by
the
shipper-owner.
in
all
circumstances,
according
to
defendant's
construction,
permissible
dividends
to
each
shipper-owner
would
jump
immediately
eight
times
as
the
pipeline
borrows
capital
equal
to
eight
times
--
borrows
from
third
party's
capital
equal
to
eight
times
the
stock
owned
by
the
shipper-owner,
so
dividends
to
the
shipper-owners
increase
immediately
eight
times.
this,
despite
the
fact
that
the
increase
in
the
pipeline's
capitalization,
represents
no
new
capital
outlay,
no
new
capital
contribution
by
the
shipper-owner.
as
a
result,
divorced
--
divorced
from
the
measure
of
each
shipper-owner's
return
is
his
capital
outlay
--
his
capital
outlay,
his
share
in
the
capitalization.
there
is
little
but
no
relation
to
the
measure
of
his
return
from
the
pipeline.
this
result,
we
urge,
is
at
odds
with
the
judgment's
basic
rationale.
this
judgment,
after
all,
not
only
specifies
a
dividend
limitation
formula,
but
in
addition,
makes
clear
that
dividends
paid
in
the
court
with
that
formula
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
last
line
of
paragraph
three
on
page
10
of
volume
1,
"shall
be
permitted
insofar
as
the
interstate
commerce
and
elkins
act
are
concerned.
the
judgment's
essential
purpose
then
drawn
from
the
elkins
act,
which
gave
it
life,
was
to
equalize
net
transport
cost,
equalize
the
net
transport
cost
between
on
the
one
hand
shipper-owners
and
on
the
other
hand,
independent
oil
shippers,
shippers
with
no
ownership
interest
in
pipelines.
to
this
end,
the
judgment
sought
to
limit
each
shipper-owner
to
a
fair
return
on
his
capital
outlay,
a
return,
if
you
will,
that
reflected
simply
the
cost
to
the
pipeline
of
the
shipper-owner's
capital
contribution.
the
shipper-owner's
capital
cost
to
the
extent
that
the
judgment
is
construed
to
limit
each
shipper-owner
only
a
fair
return,
on
his
capital
outlay,
his
net
transport
cost
become
the
same,
become
the
same
as
the
independent
oil
shipper
with
no
ownership
interest
in
the
pipeline.
and
as
a
result,
no
discrimination,
no
concessional
rebate,
no
unfairness
result.
however,
to
the
extent
that
each
shipper-owner's
dividends
are
related
not
only
to
his
capital
contribution,
but
are
measured
by
capital
contribution
that's
made
by
others,
that
excess
in
return
is
deemed
by
the
judgment
to
be
a
kin
for
discrimination,
an
offset
or
a
rebate,
at
odds
with
this
judgment
in
the
elkins
act.
stated
other
ways,
this
judgment
had
two
really
basically
simple
purposes,
two
basic
purposes
that
are
twinned,
but
related.
those
purposes
were
first,
on
the
one
hand,
to
limit
each
shipper-owner
to
a
fair
return
on
his
capital
outlay
in
order
that
the
second,
on
the
other
hand,
independent
shippers,
shippers
with
no
ownership
interest
to
the
pipeline,
might
be
protected
against
--
if
you
will,
that
favoritism
which
destroys
equality
between
oil
shippers
which
the
elkins
act
and
presumably
this
judgment,
were
meant
to
eliminate.
let's
compare.
let's
see
what
defendant's
construction
does
to
those
twin
purposes,
first,
to
limit
each
shipper-owner's
return
to
a
fair
return
on
his
capital
outlay,
table
1
and
appendix
a
of
the
united
states
reply
brief,
sets
forth
dividends
actually
paid
--
actually
paid
to
each
of
the
shipper-owners
of
the
15
pipelines
that
are
active
parties
and
interests
before
this
court,
now.
that
table
reveals
that
in
the
year
1956,
the
last
year
before
the
actions
--
now,
before
this
court
were
filed,
each
of
the
shipper-owners
received
an
average
of
18.7%
return
on
their
investment,
plus
surplus.
an
18.7%
return
on
their
investment
plus
surplus
in
the
pipelines,
a
return
more
than
two
and
a
half
times.
that
was
the
judgment
envisioned.
and
second,
what
impact
did
that
return
have?
what
impact
did
that
return
have
on
the
second
goal
of
this
judgment,
the
second
goal
to
promote
some
sort
of
equal
competitive
status
for
independent
oil
shippers,
oil
shippers
with
no
ownership
interest
in
the
pipeline.
compare
if
you
will,
dividends
actually
paid
for
the
year
1956,
the
18.7%
with
the
total
transport
revenue
of
the
pipelines
for
that
year.
that
comparison
is
quite
striking.
it
shows
that
in
the
year,
1956,
22
cents,
22
cents
out
of
every
dollar
that
each
shipper-owner
nominally
paid
in
rates,
he
got
back
via
dividend.
non
owner-shippers,
independent
oil
shippers,
got
no
20
--
such
22
cents
back.
but
the
most
important,
22
cents
out
of
every
dollar
they
did
pay,
ended
up
in
the
pocket
of
the
shipper-owner
against
who
may
might
well
be
competing
at
the
other
end
of
the
pipeline.
look
at
this
graphically,
in
terms
of
two
oil
producers
in
the
same
field
trying
to
get
their
oil
in
the
market.
one
owns
the
pipeline,
the
other
doesn't.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
certainly
do
and
it's
a
--
a
point
i'd
like
to
meet
quite
directly.
there's
no
question,
but
that
enforcement
of
this
decree
has
hardly
been
marked
by
system
and
diligence.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
has
hardly
been
marked
by
system
and
diligence.
there's
no
question.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
system
and
diligence.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
marked
by
system
and
diligence.
there's
no
question,
but
throughout
the
years,
defendants
have
consistently
construed
this
decree
as
they
now
would.
and
there's
no
question,
but
that
they
have
regularly
reported
that
construction
to
the
attorney
general
via
the
filing
of
their
annual
report.
in
these
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
--
well,
there's
no
question
that
he
never
goes
to
court.
and
these
circumstances,
our
delay
in
moving,
compels
that
considerations
of
basic
enforcement
fairness,
dictate
that
we
raise
no
issue
of
illegal
dividends
seeking
penalty
payments,
seek
no
retroactive
sweep
for
the
construction
pressed
now
before
this
court.
equally
true,
however,
in
action
warrants
no
basis
for
concluding
the
approval
from
our
failure
to
move
--
from
our
failure
to
move.
you
can't
conclude
our
agreement
with
what
the
defendants
did.
throughout
the
years,
this
judgment
has
posed
numerous
and
(inaudible)
enforcement
problems.
and
only
as
the
years
have
passed
and
the
debt
to
equity
ratios
with
these
pipelines
have
shifted
so
drastically,
has
this
problem
even
become
significant.
and
it's
only
reasonably
that
the
problem
has
become
of
such
crucially
importance.
bear
in
mind
that
the
time
this
judgment
was
entered,
put
that
to
equity
ratio
of
the
15
pipelines,
active
parties
and
interests
before
this
court
was
one
to
100.
now,
it's
more
than
2
to
1
the
other
way.
this
has
been
--
if
only
as
this
trend
developed,
this
problem
loomed
so
large.
until
it
did,
we
were
preoccupied
with
other
problems
under
the
judgment.
now,
in
these
circumstances
--
in
these
circumstances,
our
delay
in
movement
shouldn't
blur
this
court's
examination
now.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
--
i
don't
think
fairly
so
because
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
but
--
but
i
want
to
answer
that
completely.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
can't
honestly
answer
that
question
yet.
i
think
the
problem
has
become
more
significant
after
the
--
only
after
the
war,
but
if
you'll--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
exactly
right.
and
each
year,
the
problem
has
become
more
significant,
but
i
cannot
say
that
the
problem
was
insignificant
in
1946
which
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
there
certainly
was
no
negotiation.
there
were
some
--
it
was
raised
--
and
as
footnote
3
of
the
government's
reply
brief
suggests,
it
was
raised
in
a
--
a
letter
to
one
of
the
defendants
in
1951.
but
i
hardly
think
the
government
can
rest
very
heavily
on
that,
because
we
are,
as
to
the
--
the
united
states
wrote
and
asked
the
defendant
to
explain
why
he
haven't
done
--
concurred
with
this
construction,
defendant
wrote
back
and
said,
"i
haven't
done
it,
because
i
disagree
with
you
and
we
let
it
drop."
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
the
--
the
basic
problem
really
is
that
after
all
this
is
in
a
sense,
a
--
a
product
of
compromise
and
negotiation
between
parties.
on
the
one
hand,
the
united
states
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
major
components
of
the
oil
industry,
but
no
more
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
yes.
but
in
a
more
equally
basic
sense,
it
is
a
decree
of
a
court,
really
is.
and
the
inaction,
the
delay
in
moving
to
one
part
should
not
be
held
to
dissipate
the
public
rights.
the
important
public
rights
of
non-discriminatory
oil
transport
which
after
all
these
decree,
of
course,
was
meant
to
produce.
really,
our
--
our
basic
position
on
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
is.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
is
true.
that's
--
that's
true.
i
think
the
fairest
description
of
this
decree
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
it
was.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
there's
no
a
question
of
the
--
question.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
really,
our
basic
position
must
be
that
this
delay
--
this
delay
in
moving,
warrants
no
conclusion
of
agreement
or
approval.
really,
the
important
problem
now
--
i
--
i
think
this
delay
definitely
imposes
an
enforcement
obligation
on
us
in
terms
of
not
seeking
any
dividend
payments,
or
not
seeking
any
retroactive
sweep.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
certainly
does.
and
our
position
is
that
although
it's
relevant
for
that
issue,
which
as
you
put
it
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
it
doesn't
foreclose
this,
because
what
--
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
the
problem
of
inferring
agreement
or
approval
from
inaction
essentially.
and
--
and
the
decree
of
this
importance
which
really
bonds
the
in
perpetuity
of
the
united
states
and
the
major
components
for
the
oil
pipeline
industry,
this
court
should
be
very
low
to
dissipate
those
important
public
rights
which
the
decree
was
meant
to
preserve
by
concluding
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
primarily
of
its
own
inaction.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
oh,
that's
--
that's
very
true.
but
in
--
in
that
event,
mr.
justice
brennan,
those
sums
would
be
no
more
than
a
fair
--
than
a
fair
return
on
their
capital
outlay
which
according
to
the
elkins
act
rationale
of
this
judgment,
produces
no
net
difference
and
net
transport
cost,
very
different
now,
very
different
now.
we're
really
--
a
jump
as
in
a
case
of
arapahoe,
of
eight
times
in
the
pipelines
capitalization,
produces
an
immediate
jump
and
eight
times
the
dividends
to
the
shipper-owner.
under
our
construction,
as
the
debt
is
gradually
paid
off,
the
shipper-owner's
share
of
capitalization
increases
and
the
share
of
dividends
and
its
--
and
its
level
of
dividends
increase.
but
it's
only
as
the
debt
is
completely
paid
off,
that
a
share
is
equal
to
7%
evaluation.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
think
that
the
basic
disagreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
defendant
stands
initially
from
certainty
over
the
meaning
of
the
word
“its
share”.
the
essence
of
the
defendant's
position
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
word
“its
share”
has
been
constantly
and
consistently
understood
by
both
parties
as
describing
only
the
relation
between
groups,
stockholders
and
not
between
the
groups
of
investors
more
broadly,
the
relation
between
one
stockholding
and
the
total
bundle
of
investors
right.
i'd
like
to
--
on
that
point
refer,
a
bit
more
specifically
to
the
great
lakes
petition
i
think
it's
quite
helpful
on
this
point.
the
great
lakes
petition
didn't
deal
with
the
problem
of
recurring
dividend.
it
dealt
with
the
problem
as
mr.
judge
peck
has
accurately
described
with
the
capital
or
liquidating
dividend.
however
in
doing
so,
it
did
have
occasion
--
it
did
have
occasion
to
define
quite
precisely
rights
as
between
shareholders
the
very
problem,
the
very
problem
which
defendants
would
now
urge
this
court
the
word
“its
share”
beyond
doubt
clearly
defines.
however,
when
it
came
to
defining
that
right,
when
it
came
to
defining
the
relation
between
groups
of
stockholders,
the
great
lakes
petition
did
not
use
the
word
“share”.
i
think
that
is
quite
significant,
that's
one
year
after
the
decree
was
added
and
defendants
argument
is
that
its
share
was
constantly
understood
and
consistently
understood
to
describe
simply
the
relation
between
stockholders.
if
you
would
turn
to
page
139
of
the
record
before
you,
you'll
see
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
volume
2.
you'll
see
that
when
the
problem
of
relation
between
stockholders
was
expressly
of
issue
a
different
concept
was
used.
this
is
one
year
after
the
decree,
the
concept
the
shipper-owner's
proportion.
you
don't
see
the
words
“its
share”,
and
that
concept
is
specifically
defined
the
way
defendants
would
have
this
court
decide
“share”
was
always
understood.
if
that
was
so,
what
will
be
purpose
of
using
different
words,
using
different
words
which
specifically
defined
them.
really,
i
don't
mean
to
minimize
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
before
this
court.
i
think
this
case
is
important.
i
think
this
decision
will
have
significant
consequences.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
portion.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
shipper-owner,
the
quotation
is
taken
from
the
words
appear
particularly
in
paragraph
(c)
of
the
page
before
it.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
page
before
it.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
--
well
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well
i
--
i
think
the
importance
of
this
case
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well
now,
the
importance
of
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
--
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
competitive
disadvantage
which
non
owner
shippers
which
independent
shippers
in
the
oil
industry
or
labor
will
be
minimized
to
the
extent
that
dividends
are
limited
to
a
fair
return
on
the
investment
outlay
of
each
shipper-owner
a
return
which
reflects
the
capital
cost
of
his
contribution
to
the
pipeline.
my
so
point
in
mentioning
that
was
to
say
that
there's
no
question
that
this
decisions
are
difficult.
i
don't
think
it's
very
helpful
in
answering
it
to
say,
“well
the
government
is
trying
to
modify
this.”
this
isn't
construction
proceeding
but
this
is
a
modification
proceeding.
let's
look
at
this
by
way
of
the
language,
it
was
always
clear.
let's
not
look
at
the
purpose
of
what
the
parties
were
trying
to
do.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
--
no.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
--
i'm
suggesting
that
the
united
states
is
estopped
by
its
entry
into
this
judgment
from
arguing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
elkins
act
is
violated
by
these
parties
paying
any
sort
of
dividends.
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
we
do
not
claim
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
this
decree
represents
an
agreed
upon
construction
of
the
elkins
act.
a
construction
of
the
elkins
act
binding
upon
the
united
states
as
--
and
binding
on
these
parties,
i
--
i
--
it
--
we're
stopped.
our
position
really
is
--
is
quite
simple.
these
words
quite
patently
are
not
clear.
i
don't
think
it
helps
the
problem
of
deciding
what
they
meant
to
stand
up
and
say,
we
say
they're
clear.
the
government
says
there's
an
ambiguity.
so
let's
not
even
look
at
what
the
parties
were
trying
to
do
and
really
looking
at
--
at
any
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no,
i
--
i
say
--
i
think
what's
ambiguous
--
substantially
that's
ambiguous
in
the
words
they
chose
to
do.
substantially
that's
ambiguous
after
all,
let's
start
with
--
with
this
decree's
specific
reference.
not
only
to
an
injunction
against
paying
dividends
beyond
a
certain
amount
but
the
positive
statement
that
such
dividend
shall
be
permitted
under
the
elkins
act.
the
very
statute
which
gave
this
decree
life
was
the
elkins
act.
it
really
doesn't
help
very
much
in
interpreting
what
the
decree
means
say,
“don't
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
elkins
act.”
looking
at
the
purpose
of
the
elkins
act
constitutes
legislative,
turn
this
decree
into
a
rather
purposeless
as
algebra,
a
purposeless
verbal
algebra.
we
agree
to
this
--
that
--
that
a
dividend
limitation
formula
was
intended.
there's
no
dispute
as
to
that,
but
toward
what
purpose?
toward
the
simple
purpose
of
just
imposing
a
dividend
limitation
formula
for
the
sake
of
opposing
a
dividend
limitation
formula?
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes
two
weeks
after
war
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
--
begun.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
not
essentially,
as
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned.
i
--
i
think
it
--
it's
very
difficult
to
evaluate
the
parties'
purposes
16
years
after
the
fact,
but
look
at
the
word.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
but
much
important
than
simply
allowing
7%
dividend
consents
to
a
construction
of
payment
of
such
dividends
is
permissible
in
the
elkins
act.
this
is
very
different,
very
different
from
the
typical
consent
judgment,
consent
settlement
and
that
--
and
that
to
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no.
i
--
i
don't
really
think
that
that's
what
the
government
did
here.i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
suggest
simply
that
the
construction
of
the
decree
which
the
united
states
urges
does
reconcile
its
basic
consequences
with
the
purposes
of
the
elkins
act.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
that's
not
exactly
clear,
i
mean,
we
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
--
we
assume
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
they
got
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
--
the
basis
of
the
government's
suit
was
that
the
level
of
dividends
that
had
been
paid
constituted
rebates,
offsets
and
concession.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
the
prayers
for
relief,
however,
the
prayers
for
relief
are
somewhat
ambiguous.
i
--
i
frankly
have
been
trying
to
--
we
would
concede
it
throughout
this
whole
thing
that
that
was
the
theory
of
the
original
complain,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
of
what
but
really
that's
water
off
the
dam.
i
think,
the
so
point
i
--
i
would
really
like
to
make
is
that
i
don't
think
it
helps
very
much
to
say
the
words
that
are
particular
clear,
don't
look
at
what
the
parties
were
trying
to
do.
that's
really
--
that
sort
of
confession
and
avoidance.
we
so
admit
that
the
consequences
are
pretty
horrible
and
make
a
shambles
of
the
purpose
of
the
elkins
act
but
really
don't
look
at
that,
just
look
at
these
words
and
they're
--
they're
really
clear
beyond
doubt.
this
position
seems
patently
impossible.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
--
has
a
very
good
relation
to
this
problem.
our
position
is
that
there
is,
there
are
some
questions
to
what
these
words
mean
and
that
always
happens.i
think
relevant
in
resolving
that
question
is
our
delay
in
moving,
but
equally
relevant,
equally
relevant
are
the
purposes
that
the
judgment
obviously
sought
to
fulfill.
and
really
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
that's
--
i
think
the
--
the
facts
are
pretty
well
laid
out
outside
the
record
of
this
case
and
of
course
the
congressional
testimony.
an
fbi
investigation
was
begun
in
late
1953,
it
was
involving
enforcement
of
this
whole
decree
under
the
first
decisions,
that
a
new
assistant
attorney
general
had
who
came
in
saying,
“mr.
(inaudible)
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it.
that's
sitting
here
for
a
great
many
years,
let's
find
out
whether
it's
being
complied
with.”s
two
fbi
investigations
were
on
their
way
before
there
was
any
talk
of
any
hearings
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
--
any
talk
of
hearings
or
investigation
to
that.
i
--
i
don't
even
think
that's
worthy
of
comment
and
this
was
the
--
the
flowering
of
--
of
really
considerable
year
of
quite
serious
thought
as
to
how
best
to
grapple
with
the
problems
that
this
decree
followed
and
really
this
has
been
only
one
of
the
problems.
others
has
been
worked
out,
other
proceedings
have
been
filed
and
settled.
well,
i
--
i
really
have
nothing
more
basically
to
say.
really,
i
guess
our
position
is
that
you
can't
just
turn
this
into
a
--
a
purposeless
algebra.
you
really
ought
to
look
not
only
at
-
at
the
fact
that
we
waited
16
years
to
face
up
to
this
issue
but
look
also
as
to
the
purposes
the
parties
were
trying
to
effectuate
and
really
all
we're
trying
to
do
is
carry
out
what
the
parties'
original
design
was.
it
doesn't
help
doing
that
to
say
that
this
is
a
modification
of
--
of
what
the
design
is.
if
you
conclude,
this
is
a
modification
of
what
the
design
is
we've
had,
we
don't
claim
that
we
have
any
right
to
prevail
if
you
conclude
this
was
a
modification
of
the
original
design.
that's
not
our
position
at
all.
if
that's
your
conclusion,
we
have
no
case.
our
position
is
that
really
all
we're
seeking
to
do
is
carry
out
the
design.
and
in
looking
to
what
the
design
was,
look
at
what
the
parties
tried
to
do
and
you
gauge
what
the
parties
tried
to
do
from
looking
at
the
elkins
act.
really,
that
was
the
statute
under
which
the
complaint
was
brought.
if
that
statute
which
the
--
which
the
decree
specifically
recite
the
dividends
paid
in
accord
with
the
formula
are
permitted
on
it.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
purpose
of
the
elkins
act?
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
--
i
think
i
can.
the
chief
purpose
of
the
elkins
act
is
as
this
court
put
it
in
its
own
language
at
pages
461
and
462
of
the
union
pacific
case
was
to
eliminate
rebate,
concession
and
discrimination
from
the
handling
of
commerce
to
the
place,
to
the
end
that
all
persons
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
--
might
carry
on
their
activities
on
an
equal
basis.
in
fact,
favoritism
which
destroys
the
quality
between
shippers
however,
brought
about.
is
it
an
end?
then
to
go
back
into
further
history,
the
pipeline
cases
mr.
justice
holmes'
classic
description,
if
you
recall,
reaching
back
deep
into
the
roots
of
this
nation's
commercial
history.
his
classic
description
of
why
the
elkins
act
was
passed.
do
you
recall
that?
it
said
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
[laughs]
and
really
it
was
to
avoid
that
favoritism.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well
the
--
in
--
in
terms
of
the
realities
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
--
the
reality
of
oil
production
and
transport,
50
producers
in
a
field,
one
or
two
pipelines,
producer's
real
estate.of
course,
either
they
use
the
pipeline
to
get
their
products
to
the
market
or
sell
to
the
oil
company
that
owns
the
pipeline
that
the
well
had.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
exactly
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right,
that's
exactly
right.
the
statute
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no.
i
--
i
don't
say
it's
conclusive
but
i
say
that
purpose
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
light
that
it
shed
that
--
that
what
the
--
really
to
the
extent,
this
judgment
represents
the
conclusion.
our
view
is
that
dividends
beyond
a
certain
level
of
return
on
investment
or
capital
outlay
are
the
sort
of
favoritism,
or
producer
sort
of
favoritism
that
destroys
equality
which
the
elkins
act
and
this
judgment
must
have.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no.
i
--
we
submit
it
is
not.
defendants
which
have
you
believe
accept
that.
we
submit
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
not
at
all.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
we
--
the
--
not
--
not
as
a
matter
of
our
priority
reasoning
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
--
first,
the
issue
was
what
the
share
means,
that's
where
the
ambiguity.
our
position
is
that
in
resolving
that
ambiguity,
you
look
at
the
consequences
of
the
differing

decide
what
