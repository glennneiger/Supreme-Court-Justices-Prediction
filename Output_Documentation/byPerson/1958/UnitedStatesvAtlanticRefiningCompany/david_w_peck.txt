mr.
david
w.
peck
very
well,
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
w.
peck
let
me
start
by
calling
the
court's
attention
to
two
basic
facts
here,
a
pipeline
life.
one
is
that
the
oil
pipelines
of
this
country
are
pretty
close
to
entirely
owned
by
oil
companies,
oil
operating
companies,
which
shipped
over
the
lines
and
which
they
have
a
proprietary
interest
and
other
oil
companies
which
are
not
owners
also,
shipped
over
them.
the
second
basic
fact
is
that
in
the
case
of
many
of
these
pipeline
companies,
the
ownership
is
shared
by
several
oil
companies.
in
other
words,
there
is
joint
ownership
of
many
of
the
carriers
by
oil
companies.
that
basic
fact
is
all
important
as
your
honors
will
see
in
a
moment
on
the
interpretation
of
this
decree
and
the
meaning
of
the
crucial
words,
"its
share,"
which
i
shall
come
to
in
one
moment.
now,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
this
case
started
in
1941
with
a
complaint
by
the
government
that
the
shipper-owners
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
advising
the
court
at
the
recess
reminding
you
of
the
substance
of
the
complaint
filed
in
1941
which
was
that
the
receipt
of
dividends,
any
dividends
by
the
shipper-owners
of
the
pipelines
was
a
rebate.
the
government
painted
with
the
broadest
possible
brush
in
that
complaint.
there
was
nothing
about
relating
the
dividends
to
shipments.
it
was
all-embracing
that
the
payment
of
any
dividend
to
any
shipper-owner
was
a
rebate
and
the
relief
requested
was
treble
damages
over
a
period
of
years
and
an
injunction
against
the
payment
of
dividends
in
the
future.
the
answer
of
the
defendants
was
a
categorical
denial
that
the
payment
of
dividends
which
were
calculated
as
any
dividend
would
be
calculated
in
ordinary
course
from
earnings
and
paid
in
ordinary
course
without
any
relation
to
shipments
out
of
earnings
in
due
course,
could
not
be
considered
in
anyway
a
rebate.
and
the
defendants
contended
that
the
elkins
act
had
no
application
whatever
to
the
situation.
in
that
posture,
the
parties
agreed
to
a
consent
decree,
a
simple
decree
which
was
a
limitation
on
dividends.
now,
if
your
honors
would
turn
to
the
decree
which
you
may
find
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
pertinent
provisions
or
at
page
10
of
the
record,
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
exact
wording
of
paragraph
3
of
the
decree
because
there
in
a
sentence
or
two,
is
the
whole
issue
in
this
case.
paragraph
3
provides
that
no
common
carrier
may
thereafter,
in
any
year,
pay
to
any
of
its
shipper-owners
as
a
dividend
or
any
payment,
any
sums
in
excess
of
its
share.
that
is,
a
shipper-owner's
share,
its
share
of
7%
of
the
valuation
of
such
common
carrier's
property.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
so
far
as
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
elkins
act
are
concerned,
a
carrier
may
pay
7%.
valuation
is
defined
in
3
(a)
and
i
think
it
not
--
need
not
be
tamed,
your
honors.
there
is
no
dispute
about
it.
it
is
valuation
as
found
from
time
to
time
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
the
question
in
this
case,
very
simple
question
and
we
respect
a
very
--
respectfully
submit
a
very
simple
answer.
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
words
“its
share
of
7
percentum
of
valuation”?
and
we
submit
that
that
meaning
is
perfectly
clear
and
always
has
been
clear.
valuation
as
i
have
advised
your
honor
and
as
mr.
bicks
has
told
you
is
not
in
dispute.
it
is
the
valuation
as
found
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
likewise,
there
can
be
and
there's
no
dispute
about
what
7%
of
valuation
is
in
any
year.
so,
the
question
is
what
is
meant
by
a
shipper-owner
as
an
individual,
single
shipper-owner's
--
its
share
of
that
7%
of
valuation?
this
decree
obviously
had
two
purposes.
one,
was
to
limit
dividends
overall
to
7%
of
valuation.
the
other,
was
to
provide
a
formula
as
to
how
that
7%
of
valuation
was
to
be
distributed
among
the
shipper-owners.
that
comes
back
to
what
i
said
to
your
honors
in
the
beginning,
a
basic
fact
here
that
many
of
these
carriers
are
owned
by
several
shipper-owners.
in
other
words,
the
ownership
is
shared
and
as
you
observe
this
limitation
is
framed
in
the
singular
as
to
what
a
carrier
may
pay
to
each
shipper-owner
and
of
course
what
could
be
paid
was
its
share,
its
equity
share
of
7%
of
the
valuation
as
defined,
because
if
your
honors
will
just
concentrate
for
one
moment
on
that
language
and
bracket
out,
if
you're
well
either
physically
or
mentally
the
words
“its
share”
and
you
will
see
the
significance
and
purpose
of
the
words
“except
for
its
share.”
it
would
mean
that
a
carrier
could
pay
to
each
shipper-owner
7%
of
the
valuation.
clearly,
that
was
not
intended
and
as
i
had
observed
because
this
decree
was
--
was
framed
in
the
singular
as
to
what
might
be
paid
to
each
shipper-owner,
it
provided
that
each
shipper-owner
might
get
only
its
share,
plainly
we
say,
a
share
proportionate
to
share
owners.
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
it
any
other
meaning.
now,
i
come
to
the
16
years
of
uniform
and
consistent
administration
of
this
decree
between
1941
and
1957
about
which
mr.
bicks
has
been
entirely
frank.
paragraph
8
of
this
decree
requires
each
carrier,
each
year
to
submit
to
the
attorney
general
a
report
showing
its
compliance
with
the
decree.
there
is
set
fourth
the
information
which
must
be
supplied
in
order
that
each
year
the
attorney
general
might
check
on
compliance,
be
fully
informed
and
know
at
a
glance
whether
or
not
this
decree
is
being
observed
and
that
is
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
i
can
cite
it
to
you
in
the
record.
would
you
bear
with
me
just
one
moment?
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
will
give
it
to
you.
as
the
government
counsel
has
conceded,
all
during
those
16
years
from
1951
to
1957,
the
attorney
general
was
fully
informed
as
to
exactly
how
this
decree
was
being
applied.
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
at
--
at
page
31
of
the
record,
31,
you
will
find
the
--
a
sample.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i'm
told
also
page
100
--
page
118
of
the
record
and
159
of
the
record.
the
attorney
general
has
known
what
the
fullest
disclosure,
valuation
has
been
used,
7%
has
been
taken,
and
that
the
7%
has
been
divided
where
there
were
several
shipper-owners
among
the
shipper-owners
in
any
case
in
accordance
what
their
shares
of
ownership
and
that
no
deduction
at
anytime
has
ever
been
made
for
debt,
that
no
consideration
has
been
given
at
anytime
to
any
suggestion
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
creditor
share
of
this
dividend
that
could
not
be
paid.
the
full
7%
as
the
decree
provides,
7
percentum
may
be
paid,
has
been
paid
divided
as
i
have
indicated.
now,
that
is
no
mere
negative
attitude
upon
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
who
was
not
only
charged
with
responsibility
of
observing
the
enforcement
of
this
decree
but
who
actually
as
has
been
pointed
out,
policed
it
by
raising
numerous
questions
over
the
years
as
to
how
this
was
being
done
or
how
that
was
being
done.
but
at
no
time
suggesting
that
the
central
provision
of
the
decree,
this
heart
of
it,
the
7%
provision
was
not
being
observed
in
exact
accordance
with
its
terms
and
intent.
and
indeed,
in
the
year
1944
in
february
i
believe,
senator
gillette,
addressed
the
communication
to
then
--
then
attorney
general,
attorney
general
biddle
who
was
also
the
attorney
general
at
the
time
in
this
decree
was
entered
and
who
was,
this
record
shows,
actually
participating
in
the
framing
of
the
decree.
so
the
court
maybe
sure
that
attorney
general
biddle
was
familiar
with
the
decree,
what
was
in
the
decree,
what
was
intended
by
the
decree,
and
how
the
decree
had
been
observed.
and
senator
gillette
addressed
the
inquiry
to
the
attorney
general
and
asked
whether
or
not
the
decree
was
being
complied
with
by
the
defendants.
and
the
attorney
general
responded
by
saying
that
with
an
exemption
which
is
wholly
immaterial
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
carriers
have
been
in
compliance
with
the
judgment.
and
then
he
summed
up
in
order
to
enlighten
the
senator,
in
a
capsule,
by
saying
that
the
shipper-owner
may
receive
7%
of
the
valuation.
of
course,
that's
what
the
decree
said.
that's
the
way
it
had
been
observed.
now,
i
want
to
address
for
just
one
moment
to
pick
up
one
comment
made
by
mr.
bicks.
he
suggested
something
about
changing
conditions
over
the
years
as
far
as
debt
is
concerned.
he
has
appended
to
his
brief
here,
as
in
appendix
court,
what
purports
to
be
a
picture
of
the
debt
progress
over
the
years.
not
in
the
record,
anything
about
this
but
he
has
produced
that
here
and
i
will
make
a
comment
or
two
upon
it.
one,
is
that
if
regard
is
had
for
surplus
as
well
as
for
capital,
which
he
does
have
regard
for
in
his
appendix
a
and
b,
the
debt
proportion
will
come
down
to
about
50%.
in
other
words,
at
the
present
time
accepting
this
chart
and
these
figures,
debt
in
these
companies
now
amounts
to
about
50%
which
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
is
quite
an
ordinary
debt
picture.
again,
accepting
this
table,
if
you
would
draw
some
conclusion
as
to
when
debt
became
very
significant,
it
certainly
was
there
10
years
ago.
the
reason
is
quite
obvious.
within
the
year
since
this
decree
has
been
in
operation,
pipelines
have
been
extended
three
times
over.
mr.
david
w.
peck
debt
was
there,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
record
shows
that
several
of
the
companies
had
debt
in
varying
amounts.
the
plantation
pipeline
had
debt
at
that
time
of
50%
of
its
capitalization,
$10
million
of
debt
and
$10
million
in
capital
stock
and
there
can
be
no
question
but
what
the
attorney
general
was
fully
conscious
of
the
presence
of
debt
because
this
decree
in
paragraph
5
which
is
also
attached
to
our
appendix
and
which
might
--
may
be
found
at
page
12
of
the
record
contains
this
provision.
the
earnings
in
excess
of
7%
on
valuation
may
not
be
paid
out.
and
section
5
provides
what
may
be
done
with
such
earnings.
they
may
be
employed
for
working
capital
or
certain
other
purposes.
but
the
particular
one
i
would
call
you
honor's
attention
to
at
the
moment
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
one
other
thing
that
maybe
done
with
the
excess
earnings
is
to
pay
off
existing
debt.
so,
perfectly,
obviously
the
parties
were
conscious
of
the
existence
of
debt
and
that
impact
on
the
decree.
in
other
words,
perhaps
there's
still
a
prospect
of
debt.
within
the
year
after
this
decree
was
framed
and
entered,
the
attorney
general
and
the
same
attorney
general
and
the
same
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division,
mr.
thurman
arnold,
a
gentleman
who
signed
the
decree
received
an
application
from
the
great
lakes
pipe
line
company
to
recapitalize
and
for
quite
obvious
reasons
it
was
necessary
to
get
an
order
of
the
court
that
the
proposed
recapitalization
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
decree.
and
to
simplify
it
in
a
word,
i
think
a
word
is
all
that
is
necessary,
the
proposal
was
in
the
case
of
the
great
lakes
company
which
at
that
time
had
some
debt
but
not
much
debt.
it
was
at
least
90%
equity
capital,
less
than
10%
of
debt,
wanted
to
retire
its
capital
by
issuing
the
benchers
in
the
amount
of
$12
million
and
to
take
almost
the
entire
$12
million
out
and
retire
capital,
in
other
words,
the
substitute
debt
to
the
extent
of
83%
of
its
capital
structure.
now,
obviously,
that
had
to
be
approved
by
the
court
because
all
that
could
be
paid
under
the
decree
was
7%
on
valuation
in
any
year
which
i
don't
know
what
it
was,
perhaps
--
well
i
don't
know.
but
nothing
like
$11
million
or
$12
million
could
have
been
paid
out.
so,
without
going
into
any
curlicues
about
it,
i
would
just
advise
your
honors,
that
the
attorney
general,
mr.
thurman
arnold,
consented
to
an
order
signed
by
the
court
saying
that
this
might
be
done
without
violating
the
decree.
so,
there
was
there
sanctioned
in
the
clearest
form,
the
creation
of
debt
in
a
relatively
huge
amount.
now,
i'm
come
to
1957.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
attorney
general
has
recognized
what
this
decree
has
meant
and
has
approved
all
this
administration.
in
1957,
at
the
time
when
the
congressional
committee
was
investigating
the
enforcement
activities
of
the
department
of
justice,
the
motion
which
started
this
proceeding
was
made
by
the
government.
it
was
denominated
a
motion
to
carry
out
the
judgment
and
the
government
selected
a
single
company
for
the
purpose,
carefully
selected
quite
clearly,
the
arapahoe
pipe
line
company,
a
company
which
have
been
incorporated
only
three
years
or
four
which
happened
to
have
a
very
high
debt
ratio
and
undoubtedly
thinking
that
they
might
not
be
so
embarrassed
with
the
new
company
as
to
this
record
of
16
years
of
administration
they
said
that
the
arapahoe
pipe
line
company
was
violating
this
decree
by
paying
or
at
least
crediting
their
shipper-owners
with
7%
of
valuation
without
doing
what
the
government
then
suggested
should
be
doing
--
done
making
a
deduction
and
now
i'm
going
to
practically
quote
verbatim
what
they
said,
“of
making
a
deduction
from
valuation
of
that
share
of
valuation
attributable
to
the
loans
of
third
parties.”
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
investment
theory.
mr.
david
w.
peck
1957
your
honor
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
1957.
in
other
words,
the
theory
wasn't
a
word
that
the
7%
should
be
calculated
not
on
the
valuation
but
it
should
be
7%
on
the
so-called
“investment”
and
by
that
they
meant
the
capital
contribution
of
the
individual
shipper-owner.
and
in
order
to
get
that
concept
into
the
wording
of
the
decree
because
the
decree
doesn't
say
a
word
about
investment
or
a
return
on
investment,
that
the
slightest
suggestion
of
it
in
words
or
thought
in
order
to
insert
or
insinuate
that
concept
into
the
language
of
the
decree,
they
seized
upon
this
word
“share”
and
said
that
there
should
be
deducted
from
valuation,
a
share
of
valuation
which
they
attributed
to
creditors.
now,
that
construction
of
the
decree
frankly
has
always
been
based
upon
what
i
call
legerdemain
with
language.
in
their
pleadings
in
the
district
court
and
even
in
the
reply
brief,
they
post
the
problem
as
if
the
wording
of
this
decree
were
not
its
share
of
7%
of
the
valuation
but
as
if
it
were
7%
of
its
share
of
the
valuation.
in
other
words,
that
share
does
not
qualify
7%
of
its
share
qualifies
valuation
and
by
that
transposition
which
is
really
the
basis
of
the
whole
government's
case
here,
by
that
transposition
of
words
they
tried
to
impart
the
idea
that
what
you
should
do
is
take
a
share
of
valuation,
attributing
a
certain
share
of
the
creditors
and
a
certain
share
to
owners
and
then
give
the
owners
only
7%
on
its
share.
now,
the
reason
for
this
transposition
is
quite
clear.
it
seems
conceivable
to
the
government
that
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
a
creditor
share
of
valuation
and
that
lawyers,
drafting
a
decree,
lawyers
of
experience,
many
of
them
representing
the
government
and
the
defendants
might
abuse
the
word
“share
of
valuation”.
to
my
mind,
it's
inconceivable
that
lawyers
would
speak
about
a
creditor
share
of
valuation.
creditors,
of
course,
have
a
lien
on
probably
everything.
they
don't
have
a
share
of
any
problem
and
certainly,
they
don't
have
a
share
of
a
dividend.
that
is
the
most
formed
thought
to
law
one
could
suggest.
but
upon
the
assumption,
that
lawyers
might
speak
of
a
share
of
valuation
and
then
treating
this
decree
as
if
they
actually
did
speak
of
a
share
of
valuation.
they
reach
the
conclusion
that
7%
of
a
share
of
valuation
is
7%
on
the
capital
contribution
of
the
owner.
now,
the
answer
complete
and
conclusive
is
that
there
just
isn't
any
such
a
wording
in
the
decree.
the
lawyers
didn't
use
that
language.
they
said
each
share
of
7%
of
valuation
and
i
submit
that
those
words
cannot
be
misunderstood.
and
so
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honor,
that
the
government
is
not
attempting
to
do
what
they
suggested
here
originally,
carry
out
this
decree.
they're
not
even
doing
what
they've
said
secondarily,
they
were
attempting
to
do,
which
is
to
construe
the
decree
because
there
is
nothing
to
construe.
this
is
an
almost
unabashed
attempt
to
rewrite
this
decree.
and
the
district
court
so
observed
it
and
in
so
many
words
said
that
he
could
not
rewrite
the
decree
which
the
parties
agreed
to
in
1941
and
which
they
interpreted
by
this
amended
order
in
1942,
in
the
great
lakes
case.
now,
it's
perfectly
apparent
by
reading
the
government's
briefs
here,
particularly
the
reply
brief
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
rewrite
the
decree.
indeed
that
it
is
legislating
in
thought
and
effort.
it
is
addressed
to
minds
who
would
be
particularly
interested
in
policy
as
to
what
should
be
pipeline
administration.
for
one
thing,
you
will
note
that
they
have
emphasized
that
all
they
intend
to
do
here
is
something
for
the
future.
they
are
very
careful
to
say
that
they
couldn't
possibly
say
that
this
decree
has
been
violated
over
the
last
two
decades.
certainly,
it
would
be
unconscionable
they
recognize
that,
in
view
of
their
approval.
but
they
say
to
the
future,
legislatively,
they
want
to
make
this
decree
over
for
the
future.
secondly,
they
cite
to
your
honors
in
an
elaborate
footnote,
the
report
of
the
royal
commission
in
canada,
charged
with
investigating
the
administration
of
energy
in
the
dominion
a
policy
body
which
started
with
the
observation
that
pipelines
were
hardly
regulated
at
all
at
canada,
said
that
there
should
be
regulation
of
traffic
and
tolls,
said
that
the
pipeline
shouldn't
be
constructed
without
a
certificate
of
necessity
and
convenience
which
does
not
apply
to
pipeline
construction
here,
anyone
can
construct
a
pipeline
in
this
country.
and
then
says
as
a
matter
of
policy
recommended,
which
mr.
bicks
says
is
a
part
of
wisdom
that
the
rate
return
should
be
based
upon
equity
investment
without
leverage.
and
the
brief
is
otherwise
largely
beyond
the
record.
now,
if
this
court
with
this
late
date
were
interested
in
framing
a
decree
or
in
defining
national
or
legislative
policy
in
regard
to
pipelines,
i
can
understand
your
being
interested.
but
i
suggest
that
these
references
have
no
place
in
this
case
or
in
this
brief.
now,
the
excuse
for
rewriting
the
decree
is
quite
frank.
it
is
based
upon
certain
new
theories
of
the
application
of
the
elkins
act
to
the
pipeline
industry,
and
they
say
that
this
decree
must
be
interpreted
and
by
that
they
mean
reframe
to
reflect
what
they
regard
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
elkins
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
act
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
would
--
i
would
assume
that,
of
course,
they
could
have
made
an
application
for
modification
of
the
decree
upon
the
submission
of
evidence
and
going
in
to
a
lot
of
things
which
they
did
not
elect
to
go
into.
they
submitted
this
case
to
the
district
court,
your
honor,
on
a
motion
without
any
facts
attached
to
it
except
the
statement
of
what
arapahoe
was
doing
in
administering
the
decree.
they
weren't
even
recognized
for
the
purpose
of
the
submission
that
there
was
an
ambiguity
here.
now,
they
say
that
there's
an
ambiguity.
the
way
they
fashion
the
ambiguity
is
this
share
of
valuation
business,
but
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
suggestion
even
of
an
ambiguity,
they
said
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
legally,
nothing
at
all
that
i
know
of
to
stop
them
from
going
into
the
district
court
and
asking
from
a
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
peck
well,
they
wouldn't
admit
it.
in
the
--
in
the
district
court,
they're
attacked
upon
this
decree
and
it
was
an
attack
upon
the
decree,
it
was
so
clear
that
the
district
court
judge
got
the
idea
that
they
were
actually
asking
that
the
decree
be
vacated
and
you
will
note
in
his
decision
that
he
does
not
interpret
this
application,
as
an
application
to
abandon
the
decree
in
toto
and
then
he
makes
the
observation
if
the
question
was
before
him,
he
would
not
regard
the
decree
has
any
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
no,
they
don't
want
to
abandon
this
decree.
they
don't
want
to
have
the
trial
that
they
didn't
want
to
have
and
if
they
didn't
have
20
years
ago.
they
want
to
hold
these
defendants
to
this
decree
but
they
want
to
hold
them
to
an
amended
version
of
the
decree.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
indeed
your
honor.
my
observations
on
the
subject
were
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
i
would
like
to
just
mention
in
this
connection,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hughes
case,
hughes
versus
united
states
written
by
justice
--
mr.
justice
black
for
this
court
in
342
u.s.
353
in
which
you
will
recall
that
the
government,
to
use
the
words
of
the
court,
operating
on
a
front
broader
than
language
seeking
to
serve
what
they
consider
to
be
the
larger
purpose
of
a
bigger
picture
wanted
to
change
the
wording
of
a
decree
and
this
court
said
in
words
very
apt
to
this
case,
“the
detailed
plan
of
a
decree
may
not
be
set
aside
as
a
matter
of
construction
by
ignoring
language
and
looking
to
some
larger
purpose
which
is
asserted.”
now,
if
i
may,
let
me
spend
just
a
few
minutes
on
these
elkins
act
theories.
i
think
they
are
entirely
beside
the
point.
i
do
believe
that
this
case
has
been
adequately
covered
to
find
me
up
to
the
moment
as
far
as
the
problem
before
the
court
goes
but
i
do
not
want
to
neglect
the
elkins
act
theories
which
are
now
advanced.
these
theories
and
why
they
have
them,
i
don't
know
but
i
will
state
them.
the
basic
theory
seems
to
be
that
the
normal
method
of
financing
a
business,
including
any
utility,
should
be
denied
to
the
pipeline.
they
should
not
be
able
to
borrow
money
to
construct
pipelines
or
if
they
do,
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
earn
any
money
on
either
the
money
borrowed
or
the
facilities
so
constructed.
and
then
jumping
over
to
their
legal
conclusion,
they
say
just
ipse
dixit
any
return
on
borrowed
money,
any
return
on
the
facilities
constructed
with
borrowed
money
as
a
matter
of
course
becomes
a
rebate
as
a
matter
of
law,
must
be
so
considered.
and
therefore
they
say,
that
this
decree
must
be
interpreted
consistent
with
that
version
of
the
elkins
act
to
deny
to
the
defendants
any
profit
whatever
on
any
facilities
constructed.
mr.
david
w.
peck
any
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
that's
right.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
an
amended
version.
of
course,
they
don't
say
now
that
they
can't
have
any
dividends.
now,
they
say
they
can
only
have
dividends
in
amount
7%
upon
their
capital
contribution.
now,
of
course,
there's
no
law.
there's
no
case
to
support
such
a
theory
and
at
the
moment
let
me
just
call
your
honors'
attention
to
what's
perfectly
obvious
to
my
mind
that
the
theories
are
economically
untenable.
i
don't
know
what
the
earnings
of
the
pipelines
have
been
over
these
years.
i
wouldn't
regard
them
as
material.
appended
to
this
brief,
our
figures,
not
in
the
record,
for
the
year
1956
suggesting
earnings
in
the
terms
of
permissible
dividends
or
actual
dividends
for
that
year
of
about
17%
or
18%.
i
do
not
know
why
the
year
1956
was
selected.
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
accuracy
of
the
table.
i'm
not
going
to
comment
further
beyond
just
saying
one
or
two
things
which
i
happen
to
know
and
that
is
that
the
humble
oil
company
for
example
has
not
earned
its
7%
at
anytime
since
the
year
1944,
that
the
tuscarora
company
has
not
earned
its
7%
any
year
since
1946
and
the
arapahoe
company
which
they
talk
about,
all
they
paid
out
at
anytime
together
is
1%
on
valuation.
but
sufficient
through
this
point
economically,
that
the
suggestion
that
pipeline
and
the
owners
of
pipelines
should
be
limited
in
their
return
to
7%
on
their
capital
contribution
is
wholly
unrealistic.
in
the
first
place,
it's
unrealistic
to
talk
about
the
“investment”
of
the
shipper-owners
and
the
pipelines
as
if
their
only
investment
was
their
capital
contribution.
that's
almost
the
least
of
it.
of
course,
their
capital
contribution
is
a
foundation
contribution
but
this
isn't
money
put
out
of
investment.
this
is
a
business
to
which
they
give
themselves
in
the
planning,
the
designing,
the
building,
the
financing,
the
operating,
the
responsibility
of
management.
the
capital
that
they
put
in
it
is
--
is
only
one
item.
and
more
than
that,
it
has
been
quite
the
common
practice
for
the
owners
to
undertake
to
see
that
the
debt
which
is
incurred
by
the
pipelines
is
repaid
principal
and
interest.
arapahoe
for
example,
the
company
that
they
singled
out,
when
they
borrowed
this
large
amount
of
money,
it
was
under
a
throughput
agreement
in
which
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
that
loaned
the
money
was
assured
not
merely
by
arapahoe
but
by
the
owners,
sinclair
and
pure,
that
each
intrastate,
whether
the
pipeline
was
there
or
whether
it
wasn't
there,
whether
it
was
earning
money
or
whether
it
wasn't
earning
money.
on
each
intrastate,
that
interest
would
be
paid
and
in
15
years,
the
principal
would
be
paid.
and
that's
been
quite
commonly
done,
the
investors
in
the
pipelines.
i'll
just
digress
for
a
moment
to
say
that
the
reason
that
you
find
this
pipeline
picture
of
almost
entirely
oil
company
ownership
is
that
no
one
else
is
interested
in
investing
in
a
pipeline
with
the
particular
hazards
of
that
business,
hazards
which
have
been
pointed
out
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
their
ratemaking
cases
over
and
over
again.
the
pipeline
construction
ownership
and
operation
are
a
particularly
hazardous
venture
for
reasons
which
will
occur
to
your
honors.
the
pipes
there,
it
can't
be
used
for
anything
else.
all
it
can
transport
is
oil
from
an
oil
field
to
a
--
a
refinery
in
the
case
of
crude
and
the
oil
field
depletes.
other
oil
fields
may
come
in,
more
accessible,
more
productive
and
in
short
time
or
long
time,
no
one
can
say
the
asset
is
--
is
wasted.
no
one
wants
to
invest
in
a
pipeline
except
in
oil
company
as
far
as
equity
is
concerned
in
operation
and
investors
invest
on
ventures
upon
the
assurance
of
the
oil
company
owners
behind
them.
now,
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
a
7%
return
on
capital
alone
is
no
recognition
of
the
contribution
or
the
investment
of
the
owners
and
that
certainly,
the
oil
companies
would
never
have
accepted
the
decree
of
any
such
terms,
a
word
about
the
shipper
and
the
public
interest.
rates
which
are
reasonable
come
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
chairman,
the
then
chairman
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
at
the
time
that
the
congressional
committee
was
in
session,
testified
there
and
this
was
called
to
the
district
court's
attention
that
rates,
pipeline
rates
had
steadily
declined
from
the
year
1933
to
the
year
1948
that
there
had
been
no
complaints
whatever
from
shippers
or
anyone
about
pipeline
rates
being
too
high.
that
the
only
complaints
that
they'd
have
about
pipeline
rates
is
from
other
competing
carriers,
water
people,
railroads
and
the
like,
the
pipeline
rates
are
too
low.
an
oil
company,
any
oil
company
has
complete
freedom
of
the
use
of
these
pipelines,
the
same
privilege
as
an
owner,
the
same
rates
which
were
determined
to
be
reasonable
and
without
the
necessity
of
making
any
investment.
finally,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
government
has
wholly
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
settlement
of
this
case.
all
these
arguments,
whatever
you
might
say
about
them
as
a
matter
of
merit
and
i
have
tried
to
indicate
briefly
why
i
think
they
have
no
merit,
at
least
are
inadmissible,
i
suggest,
because
this
case
was
settled
nearly
two
decades
ago.
but
i
must
pause
for
a
moment
to
take
exception
to
this
adding
to
a
brief,
matters
which
are
not
in
the
record
because
it
has
an
obvious
vice
and
it's
illustrated
by
one
document
which
is
referred
to
here.
as
a
footnote
in
the
brief,
the
court
has
referred
to
a
letter
written
by
mr.
chaffetz,
counsel
for
service
pipeline
to
the
president
of
that
company.
the
legend
on
when
--
under
which
this
letter
is
referred
to
is
the
indication
that
the
government
believe
that
the
investment
concept
had
been
adopted
in
the
decree.
and
this
letter
is
cited
as
proof
of
that.
the
letter
of
march
29,
1950,
refers
to
a
position
which
was
then
indicated
by
a
member
of
the
staff
of
the
department
of
justice
an
individual
by
the
name
of
snyder
that
at
time
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
department
was
going
to
recognize
new
icc
valuations
value
written
in
this
frame
of
reference.
during
the
war
period,
the
icc
had
suspended
making
a
valuation
of
pipeline
property
so
that
for
a
period
of
years,
the
valuation
employed
under
this
decree
was
a
rather
an
old
valuation
going
back
to
1933.
after
the
war,
they
came
back
to
making
valuation.
the
first
one
as
of
the
end
of
the
year,
1947,
they
spent
several
years
doing
that,
they
didn't
complete
it
until
1952.
since
then,
they've
kept
the
valuations
up
to
date.
and
the
gentleman
for
the
name
of
snyder
in
the
department
of
justice
was
casting
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
department
was
going
to
recognize
the
new
valuation
or
whether
it
was
going
to
try
to
insist
upon
a
position
that
the
decree
throws
the
old
valuation.
mr.
chaffetz
had
a
conference
with
mr.
snyder,
and
mr.
snyder
cast
this
doubt
and
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
he
said
that
when
the
decree
was
negotiated,
the
department
sought
the
limit
permissible
return
to
7%
on
the
shipper-owners
investment
and
he
said
that
was
a
discussion
of
putting
in
exhibit
into
that
effect.
according
to
him,
at
the
industry's
suggestion,
valuation
was
substituted
for
investment
and
then
he
opined
that
they
ought
to
stick
to
the
old
valuation
instead
of
the
new
evaluation.
so,
the
letter
instead
of
supporting
what
it
cited
for
of
any
idea
upon
the
part
of
members
of
the
department
as
to
what
this
decree
meant,
it's'
perfectly
clear
what
it
meant
that
while
somebody
may
have
had
a
notion
back
there
in
1941,
that
investment
would
be
a
nice
idea.
it
certainly
wasn't
accepted
and
it
wasn't
incorporated
in
the
decree,
and
i
will
finish
this
thought
by
referring
to
page
212
of
this
congressional
record
in
which
just
completing
the
picture,
that's
all
right
on
this
point
that
assistant
attorney
general
bergson
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division
completed
the
question
of
what
valuation
should
be
used
by
saying
explicitly
the
valuation
has
brought
down
the
date
from
time
to
time.
so,
there
has
been
no
question,
and
apart
of
the
people
in
the
department
all
these
years
as
to
what
this
decree
meant
and
that's
the
importance
of
these
16
years
of
administration.
the
attorney
generals
who
have
occupied
this
position
and
the
gentlemen
who
have
been
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division
have
not
been
incompetent.
they've
been
able
to
understand
this
decree.
they've
been
duly
conscientious,
i
think
in
the
discharge
of
their
responsibilities
of
enforcement.
i
think
they
can
be
charged
neither
with
neglect
or
dereliction
of
duty.
the
importance
of
five
attorneys
general
and
the
heads
of
their
antitrust
departments
over
16
years
giving
the
same
uniform
interpretation
to
this
decree
is
of
the
utmost
significant
namely,
that
this
decree
means
what
it
says.
thank
you,
court
very
much
for
your
courtesy.
