justice
tom
c.

on
the
welding
point,
is
that
one
of
your
main
points?
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
the
burden?
justice
tom
c.

i'll
just
pass
the
welding
instead,
the
statute
require
a
welding?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
would
be
an
issue
when
a
state
did
not
have
a
requirement
at
all
and
you
entered
a
state
that
did
have
these
requirements.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
states
put
in
evidence
on
the
welding
points?
justice
tom
c.
clark

don't
know
if
you'll
refer
to
that.
i've
looked
at
that
up
but
it
doesn't
mention
the
--
i
don't
see
it
mentioning
the
welding.
i
thought
that's
one
of
your
main
points.

the
one
you're
referring
to?
