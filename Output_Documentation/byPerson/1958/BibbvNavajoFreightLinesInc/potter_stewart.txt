mr.
wines,
excuse
me.
before
you
get
to
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
these
cases
going
back
to
the
facts,
you
referred
to
what
evidence
there
was
in
the
record
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
support
of
your
position
that
these
contour
type
mudguards
were
superior
to
the
flap
type
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
on.
the
--
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
district
court
made
on
an
expressed
finding,
did
it
not,
that
it
was
conclusively
shown
that
the
contour
of
mudflap
possesses
no
advantages
over
the
conventional
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
connection,
my
question
is
this,
i
think
i
know
the
answer
but
perhaps
--
perhaps
not.
does
rule
52
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
govern
this
kind
of
a
case,
three-judge
district
court
with
a
direct
appeal
here?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
findings
of
fact
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
that
difference
that
prompted
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
the
normal
application
of
rule
52
(a)
as
we
both
know
is
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
findings
of
fact
to
the
dis
--
of
a
single
district
judge
where
there
are
normally
no
implicit
findings
of
a
state
legislative
body
involved
and
i
wondered
if
for
that
reason
or
for
any
other
reason
inherit
in
the
particular
procedure
involved
here
of
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
a
three
member
district
court.
there
was
any
question
as
to
the
applicability
of
rule
52
(a)
which
--
which
forbids
a
reviewing
court
to
set
aside
findings
of
fact
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
evaluation
of
expert
testimony,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you
really,
mr.
wines,
asking
us
to
imply
a
--
by
analogy
rule
52
(a)
to
the
findings
of
the
legislature
that
we
shouldn't
set
them
aside
unless
they're
clearly
erroneous
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unless
the
evidence
wasn't
that
clearly
erroneous.
justice
potter
stewart
not
of
--
not
of
its
own
terms
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
asking
us
to
apply
that
kind
of
a
test.
justice
potter
stewart
and
unless
the
evidence
before
the
district
court
show
that
those
findings
were
clearly
erroneous
why
they
should
--
those
legislative
findings
explicit
and
implicit
should
--
should
prevail,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
your
positions
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show,
mr.
wines
that
--
that
this
illinois
type
mudguard
would
conform
to
the
laws
of
all
the
states
except
arkansas?
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
would
and
also
on
the
further
assumption
that
it
would
violate
the
regulation
of
arkansas.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
arkansas
have
on
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
of
now
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
just
--
you
clarify
me
if
i'm
mistaken.
as
of
now,
it's
true,
is
it
not
that
arkansas
alone
among
the
25
straight
mudflap
states
has
an
interpretative
regulation
of
some
kind
expressly
holding
this
illinois
type
not
in
conformity
with
arkansas
law.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
it
appears,
this
special
contour
illinois
type,
would
be
not
violative
of
the
other
24
states
which
simply
proscribe
a
mudflap,
is
that
true
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
of
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
of
what
evidence
was
submitted?
it
occurs
to
me
only
the
part
of
the
evidence
submitted
was
the
fact
that
25
states
had
acted
in
this
area.
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice

icc
that
was
--
that
was
doing
the
job.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
may
speculatively
had
been
the
(voice

justice

to
the
(voice

--
justice

--
that
the
states
were
doing
the
job
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
still
have
difficulty
with
the
--
well,
i
consider
the
very
penetrating
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
you,
certainly
there
is
a
conflict
between
arkansas
and
illinois.
but
--
i
suppose
nobody
would
suggest
that
this
court
is
qualified,
there
is
all
the
conflict
as
to
which
has
a
better
mudflap.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn't
--
isn't
it
equally
--
the
arkansas
statute
creates
the
conflict?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
--
you
think
this
court
is
as
bound
by
those
findings
of
the
three-judge
district
court
as
would
be
a
--
a
court
of
appeals
by
findings
of
a
single
district
judge
and
an
ordinary
contract
to
tort
action
under
rule
52
(a)
of
the
federal
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
lacking
because
the
state
took
the
position
of
the
district
court,
did
it
not,
that
this
was
all
irrelevant
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
legislative
findings
were
conclusive
or
at
least
--
or
at
least
presumptively
reasonable?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
result
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
result,
the
--
the
state
elected
not
really
to
put
in
a
case
on
that
issue,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wouldn't
--
would
it
follow
from
that
that
--
that
we
agreed
with
you
as
to
what
the
state
should
have
done
and
that
we
scream
at
it
to
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
axelrod,
this
is
a
case
according
to
your
position,
is
it
not,
where
the
entire
constitutional
issue
depends
ultimately
upon
issues
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
respect,
it's
at
least
an
unusual
case
and
that
most
constitutional
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
why
if
--
if
your
position
is
correct
that
the
entire
constitutional
question
depends
upon
resolutions
of
factual
issues.
why
in
conformity
with
this
court
many
times
repeated
to
you
that
it
will
not
determine
constitutional
questions
until
or
unless
the
necessity
to
do
so
arises,
why
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
if
this
court
agree
with
you
to
remand
this
to
the
district
court
to
give
the
state
a
full
opportunity
to
present
its
evidence
on
the
facts
and
to
give
therefore
that
court
a
fuller
opportunity
that
it
is
not
add
up
to
now
to
resolve
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
i
understand.
and
so
as
a
result,
we
have
an
unbalanced
record
factually.
we
do
have
factual
findings
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
district
court.
but
a
district
court,
as
you
would
agree
i
suppose,
is
certainly
much
better
equipped
than
this
court
to
determine
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
if
the
allegation
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
what
mr.
justice
black
is
referring
to
is
the
allegation
paragraph
24
of
the
complaint
appearing
on
page
12
of
the
record
saying
there
is
but
one
type
of
mudflap
or
splash
guard
which
can
satisfy
the
requirements
