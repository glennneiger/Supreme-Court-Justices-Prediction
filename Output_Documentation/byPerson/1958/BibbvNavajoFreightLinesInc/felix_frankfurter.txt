justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
mr.
wines.
what
witnesses
gave
rise
to
the
district
court's
finding?
i
mean
what
type
of
witness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
put
to
the
states
a
--
a
testimony
of
each
witnesses
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
tell
us,
if
you'd
be
good
enough,
tell
us
what
witnesses
were
called
to
show
that
this
is
absolutely
pointless?
there's
no
remote
justification
to
make
these
requirements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
the
plaintiff,
the
appellee
for
witnesses
to
show
the
ruthlessness
of
this
(inaudible)
requirement
if
the
state
object
in
the
testimony
and
it's
irrelevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
grounds?
the
finding
of
the
enactment
is
conclusive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
a
man
may
read
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
must
be
your
position
here
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
open
--
if
it's
open
to
consider
the
relevance
of
the
testimony,
then
we
got
this
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
translate
that.
does
that
mean
that
considering
the
weight
of
which
the
legislation
is
held,
carried
itself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
testimony
of
non-reasonableness
or
unreasonableness,
creates
into
unimportant,
is
that
it,
the
weight
of
the
evidence?
or
do
you
say
that
the
party
of
the
legislature
is
conclusive?
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
turn
to
the
issue
that
it's
immaterial
with
a
lot
of
witnesses
said
on
the
subject
when
the
legislature
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
in
the
realm
of
evidence,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
that
really,
it's
not
in
the
realm
of
ordinary
(inaudible)
ordinary
conscience
in
the
court.
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
should
beyond
the
hypothesis
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
in
terms
of
the
rule,
clearly
erroneous
finding,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
to
me
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
saying
that
being
the
record
as
i
call
upon
the
judges,
i
conclude
--
i
must
conclude
the
district
court
have
no
business
to
(inaudible)
to
place
the
scale
the
way
it
did
or
that
i
don't
care
what
the
evidence
was
the
legislature
of
illinois
is
controlling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
on
the
first
ground,
you
say
the
evidence
is
defined
as
clearly
erroneous
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
view
of
the
evidence
on
the
one
hand
and
the
strong
presumption
of
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
this
is
not
clearly
out
of
facts
to
justiciable
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
on
that
point,
mr.
wines,
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
burden
commerce
for
the
legislature
of
illinois
with
all
might,
can
affect
the
wisdom
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
that
the
determination
by
the
state
legislature
of
illinois
that
this
does
not
burden
commerce.
that
certainly
doesn't
carry
the
weight,
if
it
carried
any
weight,
the
determination
of
a
particular
construction
is
necessary
to
say.
are
you
suggesting
that
--
that's
slightly
a
question
of
whether
this
is
a
desirable
gadget
or
whatever
you
call
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
burden
problem,
i
don't
know
if
that
comes
with
any
particular
validity
or
legitimacy
because
illinois
passed
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
on
the
way
of
meeting
things
in
the
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
what
is
with
the
southern
pacific?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
can
go
with
you
when
you
say
what
illinois
judges
are
necessary
to
the
safety
within
its
border
that
whether
the
burden
of
--
of
its
judgment,
are
--
to
my
point
of
view,
is
sufficient
or
remote
(inaudible)
measured.
i
don't
think
you
can
also
make
it
carry
that
thereby,
it
shows
that
it
is
in
commerce
(inaudible),
isn't
that
answer
a
little
more
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
say
was
the
difference
between
the
southern
pacific
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
illinois
get
no
contribution
from
the
federal
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
in
the
--
what
was
it?
equality
against
somebody.
justice
brandeis
made
an
important
point
as
i
recall
it
--
drew
an
important
point
when
the
very
considerable
appropriations
of
federal
moneys
to
state
built
road.
when
you
say,
you
fill
in
yourselves,
does
that
mean
you
pay
for
them
yourselves
in
order
to

federal

i
mean
federally
completed
road,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what's
--
what's
the
point
of
that
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
state
only
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
it
could
burden
interstate
commerce
although
it
couldn't
burden
it
if
it
didn't
pay
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
unreasonable
then
you
don't
need
to
rely
on
that
argument
(inaudible)
on
that
argument.
if
it's
not
unreasonable
then
it
comes
within
what
we
call
the
state
police
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
hardly
puts
up
the
money
then
it's
going
to
be
more
unreasonable?
justice
felix

they
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
say
it
didn't
apply
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
arkansas
give
leeway
or
does
much
to
conform
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

coming
in
with
an
automobile
not
having
these
flaps
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

arkansas
would
be
in
the
same
token.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
--
i
have
justice
black's
curiosity
of
wanting
to
hear
or
see
with
my
eyes
the
exact
substantive
power
granted
to
the
commission
which
it
could
exercise
tomorrow
or
next
week
and
which
it
has
withheld
exercises
as
against
maurer
against
hamilton
where
there
was
an
expressed
reservation
to
deal
with
this
subject
matter
in
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
probably
have
it
in
your
mind,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
you
gave
me
section
2
but
what's
the
(inaudible)
what
does
it
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
left
with
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
basis
of
our
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
here.
you
indicated
that
the
state
--
that
the
icc
does
have
power
to
make
a
uniform
provisions
for
the
country.
what
is
the
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
supposed
the
record
have
showed
that
the
casualty
on
your
illinois
road
was
three
times
as
high
as
the
casualty
on
comfortable
roads
leading
in
and
out
of
great
metropolitan
center.
and
that
on
the
basis
of
such
experience
non-action
by
the
icc,
the
illinois
legislature
then
made
a
provision
and
the
casualties
were
due
to
whatever
specific
or
dominant
cause.
and
the
legislature
then
made
a
mandatory
--
mandatory
enactment
requiring
certain
safeguards
which
in
the
fair
judgment
of
the
legislature
would
reduce
that
carnage.
no
other
state
had
it.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
hasn't
enacted.
i
take
your
word
that
it
could.
what
would
you
say
to
that
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
arguing
this
that
there
--
there
must
be
--
since
commerce
is
--
is
involved
concededly.
this
affects
trucks
coming
in
and
out
of
the
state
if
the
commerce
is
involved
that
in
order
to
counteract
(inaudible)
burden,
meaning
doing
something
you
have
to
do
before
illinois
requires
it
while
surrounding
states
don't
or
may
not.
in
order
to
counteract
burden,
i'm
not
talking
due
or
undue,
you
show
that
the
state
has
a
localize
interest
in
the
protection
of
its
life
of
the
safeguarding
of
living
which
overbears
whatever
maybe
the
consequences
either
of
inconvenience
of
a
cause
upon
--
upon
the
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
suppose
this
statute
had
been
restricted,
have
been
confined
by
illinois
to
trucks
doing
exclusively
local
business,
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
intrastate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
they
are.
but
--
but
would
that
be
on
the
basis
that
then
the
determination
through
the
enactment
of
the
legislation
is
--
by
the
legislatives
conclusive
as
to
its
safety
relevance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
the
federal
--
suppose
the
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
state
legislatures
said
they
should
--
they
should
have
a
rather
fancy
balloons
floating
in
front
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you'll
be
here
to
say
that
that
has
no
relation
to
anything,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
local
--
as
to
intrastate
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
as
to
that,
howsoever,
find
of
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
maybe
on
that
question,
when
it
comes
to
its
effect
upon
--
into
the
national
interest,
it
can't
be
valued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
before
the
commission
a
proposal
to
it,
to
provide
for
these
mudflaps?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose
you
can
tell
by
the
appearances
before
the
commission.
were
they
noted
in
these
reports?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
tell
probably
with
your
experience
from
the
appearances
where
the
proponent
and
opponent
of
such
a
proposal
in
fact
submitted
matters
to
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
merely
saying
that
the
subject
matter
was
canvassed
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
on
icc
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
as
i
heard
what
you
read,
the
commission
said
explicitly
that
by
their
action,
they
did
not
need
to
supplant
local
rules?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
have
they
--
but
--
but
they
refused
to
deal
with
this
subject
matter.
as
i
get
your
recital,
the
subject
matter
is
cancelled.
the
commission
kept
its
hands
off
and
explicitly
said
local
rules
shall
continue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
--
why
will
they
explicitly
allow
this
existing
laws
if
ever
there
were
laws
to
prevail?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
read
it
--
as
i
interpret
what
you
read,
they
refused
to
make
a
uniform
rule
for
the
nation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
in
existence
local
rules
and
they
said
for
the
present,
we
let
those
local
rules
prevail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
was
not
in
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
no
conflict
except
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
conflict
between
the
states
that
have
something
all
uniformed,
those
who
have
it
and
the
states
that
have
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
--
except
between
the
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
had
a
requirement
and
the
states
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
they
made
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask,
mr.
axelrod,
was
that
under
the
power
to
do
a
tribute
to
the
commission,
it
could
outlaw
this
contour
device
if
it
thought
it
would
be
a
hazard
to
safety
as
you
claim
it
is
instead
of
being
a
protection
against
hazard.
but
they
outlaw
it
by
saying
we
find
that
this
uniform
of
this
mudflap,
it's
all
right
if
we
find
this
as
--
not
only
not
all
right
but
also
creates
a
conflict
and
therefore
we
--
in
the
interest
of
uniformity
practically
adopt
or
allow
instead
of
making
a
rule
of
our
own
or
a
prescription
of
our
own,
we
allow
any
state
that
wants
to
have
this
flap
uniformity
but
not
anything
else.
could
they
do
that
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
could
--
they
could
--
i
inferred
from
what
you
said.
they
could
themselves
provide
for
the
flap
--
for
the
flaps,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
they
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
provide
for
those
by
any
state
that
wants
to
have
them.
i
just
think
if
they
have
power
to
prescribe
it
for
40
--
for
50
states,
they
could
prescribe
it
--
leave
it
to
the
relation
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
they've
actually
done
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
argument.
if
they
have
allowed
by
(inaudible)
states
to
prescribe
in
lieu
of
their
prescription,
they
may
take
account
of
different
weather
conditions
for
all
i
know,
i'm
ignorant
about
it,
in
a
different
state.
some
states
may
not
need
this
at
all
states
--
dry
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
it
be?
it
also
comes
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
really
be
your
ultimate
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
--
not
that
the
illinois
provision
is
in
conflict
with
anything
that
the
icc
has
done
but
that
neither
the
icc
nor
the
illinois
legislature
can
authorize
what
may
be
found
to
be
an
undue
burden
on
commerce.
that's
really
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
said
that
this
law
insofar
as
it
was
restricted
to
local
intrastate
illinois
traffic.
you're
not
challenging.
you're
not
--
your
case
doesn't
allow
you
to
challenge
it.
you
haven't
got
that
kind
of
a
case
and
your
state
supreme
court
has
already
sustained
its
restricted
application
to
intrastate
illinois
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
real
question
and
the
only
question
is
whether
this
is
--
since
you're
not
here
challenging
this
as
violative
of
due
process
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
the
only
--
the
real
question
is,
is
this
southern-pacific
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
you
introduce
evidence
to
try
to
establish
that
in
fact
this
would
be
an
undue
burden
on
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
witnesses
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
they
give
testimony
and
the
state
crossed-examined
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
the
state
look
at
those
in
this
record
and
when
mr.
wines
comes
to
reply,
i
hope
he'll
also
get
himself
with
this
question.
did
the
state
resist
the
determination
of
that
issue
by
witnesses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
turning
to
the
question
put
to
you
by
justice
stewart
yesterday.
if
the
state
said
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
because
if
this
is
a
safety
measure
and
would
be
found
to
be
a
safety
measure
and
it
may
be
found
to
be
a
safety
measure
on
the
presumption
that
the
legislation
itself
carries
then
why
didn't
they
say
that
that
is
not
an
issue
and
therefore
they
ought
to
meeting
the
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
mean
isn't
that
the
fact
if
--
if
illinois
said,
“that
is
not
an
issue
before,
your
honors.”
at
one
point
they
were
asked
whether
they
weren't
really
suggesting
that
as
to
automobiles,
the
southern
pacific
case
doesn't
apply
because
railroads
are
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
that
issue
was
not
contested
and
if
the
issue
which
they
did
or
goes
against
them,
why
doesn't
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
becomes
pertinent
in
case
we
should
disagree
with
the
state
namely
that
they
then
would
have
a
right
to
canvass
that
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
yesterday,
you
thought
not.
you
thought
that
if
--
if
they
had
claimed
that
if
by
--
if
it's
presumptively
effective
measure,
here
we
deem,
nothing
more
to
be
said
if
they
so
much
prevail.
if
that
is
rejected
as
--
even
though
the
question
of
undue
burden
of
interstate
commerce
as
to
which
you
did
address
yourself
the
witnesses.
but
as
to
what
the
state
said,
that's
not
an
issue.
why
does
it
not
become
an
issue
if
the
ground
of
their
defense
falls?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
quoted
their
argument
and
said
we
don't
want
to
play
that
game.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
request
a
question.
and
i
ought
to
be
putting
it
clearly.
you
did
but
they
didn't.
they
thought
that
they
could
rest
on
their
claim
that
this
is
a
safety
measure
justified
or
indicated
by
local
police
policy.
now,
whether
rightly
or
wrongly,
they
didn't
go
into
the
other
issue,
they
didn't
so
it
appear.
and
my
question
is
what
justice
stewart's
question
yesterday
was,
are
they
therefore
foretold
from
leading
the
issue
if
they
choose?
in
case
one
should
agree
with
you
and
say,
yes
on
this
record
there
is
ostensible
or
prima
facie
of
undue
burden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
tell
them
that
they're
mistaken?
and
therefore,
as
they
say,
“all
right,
if
you're
not
instructed
that
--
this
although
seemed
to
be
a
safety
measure
by
illinois
in
fact
operates
adversely
to
the
commerce
clause.”
we
so
instruct
them,
why
should
they
be
cut
off
from
proving
that
it
doesn't
operate
adversely?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
i
think
they
did
try.
in
addition
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
and
still
don't
want
--
to
my
understanding
with
the
question,
assume
that's
all
true.
they
now
want
to
prove
that
in
fact
it
isn't
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
were
they
--
it
wasn't
an
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
base
your
case
on
that
claim.
they
said
that
is
not
the
claim
before
the
court.
it
would
be
irrelevant.
the
claim
that's
before
the
court
is
a
safety
measure
and
that
it
should
be
bound
to
be
a
safety
measure
at
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
court
found
it
wasn't
a
safety
measure.
but
the
court
--
but
they
did
not
contest
which
they're
capable
of
contesting.
all
right,
it
is
your
safety
measure
but
it's
a
burden
on
commerce.
and
now
they
show
--
why
can't
they
now
show
it
isn't
a
burden
on
commerce?
why
should
all
this
be
left
to
argumentation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
did
not
avail
themselves
by
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
avail
themselves
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
axelrod
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
probably
familiar
with
the
two
hammond
cases.
the
city
of
hammond
against
schappi
bus
line
in
275
u.s.
where
the
lower
court
issued
an
injunction
against
the
state
--
city
ordinance
on
the
ground
that
it
was
referred
in
interstate
commerce
was
one
of
these
motor
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
bus
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
court
said
when
you
had
a
conflict
between
state
law
and
the
constitution,
we'd
like
to
have
more
detailed
enlightenment
as
to
just
how
the
--
this
does
burden
and
send
it
back
on
its
own
initiative
because
of
the
consideration
to
which
justice
stewart
referred,
namely,
we
don't
declare
things
unconstitutional
particularly
against
state
action
unless
the
decree
has
been
--
reflect
to
fully
canvassed
fact
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
on
one
side
with
the
state
for
stupid
reasons,
if
you
will,
or
unimaginative
reasons
or
wrong
conception
of
law
didn't
contest
this
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
should
we
declare
something
unconstitutional
because
the
state
took
a
narrow
or
shortsighted
view
on
the
advice
of
some
counsel
that
this
isn't
an
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
would
have
in
good
pleading
a
hundred
years
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
welding
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
the
state
counsel
did
claim
that
the
enactment
of
what
purported
to
be
--
what
professes
to
be
a
safety
measure
forecloses
any
further
consideration
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
his
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
aren't
--
if
you
look
at
page
259
(inaudible)
well,
is
it
you
theory
that
a
legislator
of
greater
latitude
in
--
in
imposing
a
burden
on
commerce
as
it
concerns
the
operation
of
motor
vehicles
in
contrast
to
a
railroad.
mr.
houston
-
no,
not
exactly.
judge
(inaudible),
your
argument
is
pretty
close
to
it
doesn't
it?
mr.
houston,
it
gets
pretty
close
judge
but
we're
having
this
distinction.
then
he
goes
ahead
and
makes
the
distinction
which
is
the
very
thing
that
judge
(inaudible)
question
has
indicated,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
wasn't
because
the
passage
of
the
act
had
foreclosed
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
add
a
qualification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
if
justice
black
would
accept
the
amendment.
as
to
issues,
the
case
was
not
tried
as
adequately.
it
was
scared
to
try
it.
it
went
back
as
to
issues
not
actually
contested
for,
not
as
to
that
it
might
deal
with
the
same
question
that
it
is
being
(inaudible)
more
contemplated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
implying
though,
you
just
said
that
--
that
it
may
take
fair
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
commission.
it
draws
a
challenge
to
a
state
law
that
in
fact
it
does
undue
burden
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
states
also
require
the
flat?
24
or
20?
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
except
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
illinois,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
illinois
can
determine
whether
it
--
whether
it
--
everybody
else
should
have
margin
line
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
entering
and
leaving.
justice
felix
frankfurter
coming
and
going.
justice
felix
frankfurter
337.
that's
right.
