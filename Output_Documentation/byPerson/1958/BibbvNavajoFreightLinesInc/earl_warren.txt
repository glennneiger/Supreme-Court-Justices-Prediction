chief
justice
earl
warren
do
all
your
illinois
trucks
--
are
they
equipped
with
these
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
does
it
been
in
existence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
axelrod.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
axelrod,
did
--
did
mr.
wines
concede
that
it
was
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
what
he
said
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
rather
heavy
burden.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
submit
them
to
us
for
the
morning
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
power
if
under
statute
--
the
statute
prescribes
that
the
states
may
have
safety
devices
not
inconsistent
with
those
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
federal?
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
commission.
now,
if
they
--
if
the
states
can't
go
beyond
their
regulations,
why
do
you
say
it
would
--
it
would
be
a
usurpation
of
power
for
them
to
say
what
could
and
what
could
not
be
done
by
way
of
safety
regulations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
generally
thought
it
would
be
usurping
the
legislative
power
of
the
state
for
this
court
to
determine
what
was
legislative
permissible
in
--
in
such
fields,
haven't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
true
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
was
that
it
never
had
interfered
with
the
state
in
this
field.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wines.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
mr.
wines,
some
place
in
the
record
the
state
did
go
into
the
question
of
a
safety
factor
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
did
show
that
there
was
not
as
much
sideward
splash.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
they
did
meet
the
issue
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
didn't
they
go
all
the
way
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
you
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wines,
in
view
of
the
questions
that
we
asked
you,
would
you
let
us
know
as
soon
as
possible
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
position
of
the
state
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
thank
you.
