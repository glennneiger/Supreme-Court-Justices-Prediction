mr.
david
axelrod
may
it
please
the
court.
illinois
and
25
other
states
in
regard
to
this
subject
matter,
prior
to
1955
and
beginning
with
1955
covered
the
field
of
this
particular
kind
of
equipment
with
what
is
known
as
a
straight
mudflap
requirement.
in
1955,
illinois,
for
the
first
time,
changed
its
mudflap
requirement
to
that
of
a
contour
type
of
mudflap
requirement.
illinois
today
is
the
only
state
in
the
union
which
stands
out
with
a
contour
type
mudflap
requirement.
the
states
adjoining
illinois
today
including
illinois,
india
--
including
indiana,
missouri,
kentucky
and
iowa
have
no
mudflap
requirements
whatsoever.
the
state
of
wisconsin
adjoining
illinois
on
the
north
had
a
mudflap
requirement
and
it
is
of
the
so-called
straight
or
conventional
type
which
was
enacted
by
25
other
states
in
1951.
the
balance
of
the
states,
including
the
district
of
columbia,
has
no
kind
of
mudflap
requirement
whatsoever.
well,
that's
therefore
with
the
position
that
states
surrounding
illinois
except
wisconsin
have
no
requirement
whatsoever.
wisconsin
has
the
straight
mudflap.
illinois
for
the
first
time
in
1955
and
subsequently
in
1957
developed
the
specific
kind
of
mudflap
called
the
contour
kind.
the
--
mr.
david
axelrod
arkansas
has
the
straight
mudflap
requirement
which
was
a
regulation
passed
by
the
arkansas
commission
in
1957
and
which
resulted
in
connection
with
this
particular
case
with
an
arrest
by
illinois
of
a
vehicle
carrying
the
contour
--
carrying
the
straight
mudflap
requirement
of
arkansas
into
illinois.
that
is
an
arkansas
equipped
vehicle
with
a
straight
mudflap
which
was
the
requirement
for
arkansas
was
arrested
in
illinois
because
it
didn't
have
the
contour.
conversely,
had
an
illinois
contour
flap
vehicle
come
to
arkansas
under
the
arkansas
statute,
it
would
have
been
illegal
in
the
state
of
arkansas
and
so
we
have
a
clear
conflict
of
the
arkansas
and
illinois
requirements
in
this
respect.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
arkansas
requirement
is
the
same
as
all
other
states.
illinois
standing
alone
in
this
contour
feature.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
same
thing
might
happen
--
mr.
david
axelrod
exactly,
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
crazy
quote
pattern
could
develop
in
all
48
states.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
would
be
correct.
that
would
be
correct,
yes.
except
with
the
possible
exception
of
two
states
of
idaho
and
oregon
which
have
a
little
bit
of
a
question
mark
in
the
record
there
as
to
whether
or
not
their
statute
prescribed
what
they
call
a
fender
guard.
now
there's
a
little
bit
of
a
haze
in
the
record
on
that
question.
we
feel
that
perhaps
the
answer
would
be
that
the
illinois
contour
might
not
pass
the
fender
guard
requirement
of
idaho
and
oregon
but
i
won't
put
a
positive
yes
to
that
--
for
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
david
axelrod
i'm
not
suggesting
that
arkansas
is
right.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
problem
created
by
the
fact
that
illinois
has
taken
upon
itself
to
require
a
particular
piece
of
equipment
with
such
specificness
that
nothing
else
can
be
used
in
connection
with
this
particular
purpose
by
a
state,
presents
to
this
court
the
question
of
conflict
as
between
arkansas
and
illinois
which
now
arises
in
this
record
and
which
can
and
will
arise
under
any
subsequent
holding
by
this
court
if
this
court
should
hold
the
illinois
statute
a
valid
one.
we
say
that
this
focuses
the
question
of
conflict
and
we
say
that
we're
in
an
area
where
uniformity
is
required
or
else
there'd
be
no
regulation
as
it
stands
today.
and
a
question
was
asked
to
mr.
wines
a
few
minutes
ago
with
respect
to
the
position
of
the
icc
on
this
subject
matter.
the
icc
does
have
the
power
to
prescribe
a
uniform
mudflap
if
it
wants
to
in
my
opinion.
however,
it
did
enter
upon
an
investigation
of
the
subject
matter
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
such
should
be
done.
and
in
its
report,
in
54
m.c.c.
337
indicated
as
follows,
“the
proposed
rule
on
wheel
flaps
has
been
eliminated
after
a
study
of
further
evidence
which
has
been
submitted".
now
they
dealt
with
whether
or
not
there
was
a
need
for
a
mudflap
or
a
wheel
flap
and
did
so
and
decided
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
icc,
there
was
no
need
for
such
a
requirement.
mr.
david
axelrod
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
have
at
the
moment.
i
believe
it
was
1952.
i
think
it
was
april
1952.
mr.
david
axelrod
there
is
no
indication
in
the
icc
report
as
to
what
evidence
was
submitted.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
axelrod
that's
our
position.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
our
position.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
our
position.
and
we
say
further
in
this
particular
respect
that
we're
not
arguing
here
with
the
right
of
the
state
to
pass
some
safety
legislation.
we
say
that
there
is
a
place
for
state
safety
legislation
but
we
say
that
the
state
can
go
too
far
in
its
attempt
to
state
safety
regulation
and
where
it
goes
too
far
and
burdens
as
mr.
wines
very
agreeably
concedes
this
does
and
then
the
state
statute
must
fall.
that's
our
position
in
this
--
in
this
case
exactly.
mr.
david
axelrod
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
resolve
that
conflict.
we're
asking
this
court
to
strike
down
an
illinois
statute
which
creates
a
conflict.
and
we
say
that
it
is
the
--
mr.
david
axelrod
no,
it's
the
illinois
statute
which
creates
the
conflict
because
the
illinois
statute
undertakes
with
specificity
to
describe
only
a
particular
kind
of
a
piece
of
equipment
that
can
be
used.
and
in
kelly
versus
washington,
this
court
held
that
where
a
state
attempted
to
design
specifically
the
structure
of
a
tug
or
a
vessel
that
it
went
too
far
because
if
washington
could
do
it,
california
could
do
it,
oregon
could
do
it
and
the
result
would
be
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
which
we
say
is
the
only
issue
on
this
proceeding.
mr.
david
axelrod
arkansas
gives
no
leeway,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
have
--
mr.
david
axelrod
arkansas
--
mr.
david
axelrod
arkansas
gives
no
leeway.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
arkansas
is
specific
in
requiring
the
straight
mudflap
as
illinois
is
in
requiring
the
contour
mudflap.
so
we
--
we
present
the
conflict
question
just
squarely
as
it
can
be.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
do
not
--
mr.
david
axelrod
we
do
not.
we
do
not
rely
on
that.
i'm
pointing
that
out
simply
as
his
--
history
or
as
background.
i
do
not
rely
on
it.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
rely
--
mr.
david
axelrod
you
can
to
the
extent
of
this
decision
and
of
this
proceeding.
yes,
your
honor,
you
can.
i
was
pointing
it
out
by
way
of
historical
background
and
information
to
the
court.
mr.
david
axelrod
and
it's
in
our
complaint.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes,
i
do
based
upon
the
concession
that
this
represent
and
undue
an
unreasonable
burden
and
based
upon
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
three-judge
court
which
go
even
further
than
representing
it
to
be
undue
and
--
and
obstructive.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
three-judge
court
and
its
opinion
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
i
don't
know
what
is
the
differences
between
undue
or
heavy
but
if
he
hasn't
conceded
it
to
be
undue,
it's
our
position
here
that
this
statute
on
--
is
an
undue
burden
and
it
is
obstructive
of
interstate
commerce.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
three-judge
court
found
it
to
be
an
insurmountable
burden
and
found
that
the
statute
not
only
obstructed
commerce
but
as
between
arkansas
and
illinois
obliterated
commerce.
now,
you
can't
go
much
further
than
that
from
the
standpoint
of
indicating
the
undue
burden
or
the
obstruction
to
commerce
then
--
the
district
court
in
our
case.
but
in
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
the
mudflap,
the
contour
mudflap
is
--
mr.
david
axelrod
--
the
contour
--
the
contour,
the
illinois
contour
mudflap.
mr.
david
axelrod
it's
a
special
brand,
your
honor.
it's
a
special
brand
of
mudflap.
mr.
david
axelrod
by
several
companies
ostensively,
but
--
mr.
david
axelrod
the
other
is
not
a
special
brand.
the
other
is
what
we
call
a
straight
or
a
conventional
mudflap
which
is
manufactured
by
any
number
of
companies.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
contour
mudflap
has
to
be
welded
to
the
trailer
and
--
mr.
david
axelrod
this
is
the
illinois
statute.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
illinois
mudflap
has
to
be
welded
to
a
trailer.
and
one
of
our
problems
in
this
case
and
we
showed
it
in
the
evidence
was
that
as
suggested
by
mr.
wines,
the
trailer
is
ought
to
be
stop
to
the
state
line
according
to
the
state
and
the
contour
mudflap
ought
to
be
put
on
because
of
the
illinois
requirement.
we
point
out
in
the
evidence
that
because
this
contour
mudflap
has
to
be
welded
under
the
trailer
and
because
we
with
our
trailers
are
carrying
explosives
for
example
in
interstate
commerce
that
it's
a
physical
impossibility
and
would
be
contrary
to
the
explosive
rules
and
regulations
for
anyone
to
touch
that
trailer
by
a
welding
process
and
that
the
difficulty
was
not
just
that
but
it
was
a
question
of
danger
and
safety.
so
we
have
instead
of
an
attempt
that
safety
feature
to
the
contour
flap,
we
have
unsafe
advantages
that
would
--
would
be
created
by
this
very
kind
of
mechanism.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
three-judge
court
opinion
in
our
case
repeatedly
points
out
that
not
only
does
this
appliance
have
no
safety
value
to
it
at
all
over
and
above
the
straight
mudflap
which
is
what
every
one
of
these
vehicles
now
carry
and
which
is
the
kind
that
is
good
in
all
of
the
states.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
shown
that
this
introduce
new
hazards
on
the
highway,
create
new
dangers.
and
these
are
specific
findings
of
fact
which
are
contained
in
a
three-judge
court
opinion
accompanied
by
its
findings
of
fact.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
authority
of
--
mr.
david
axelrod
the
authority
of
interstate
commerce
commission,
mr.
justice
black
is
in
section
204
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
however,
the
reference
to
section
204
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
disclosed
in
connection
with
this
court's
decision
in
maurer
versus
hamilton
where
the
question
there
and
mr.
wines
adverts
to
maurer
versus
hamilton,
the
question
there
and
the
state
relies
on
maurer
versus
hamilton
was
whether
or
not
the
state
of
pennsylvania
there
have
the
right
to
prescribe
a
prohibition
against
the
carrying
of
a
passenger
car
in
a
trailer
over
the
cab
of
the
driver.
and
this
court
held
in
that
case,
the
state
did
have
the
right
in
that
instance
to
enact
such
legislation
on
the
specific
ground
that
the
question
of
weight
and
width
of
a
motor
vehicle
was
a
question
which
was
specifically
reserved
unto
the
state
by
section
225
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
this
is
the
basis
and
this
is
the
justification
for
this
court's
holding
in
maurer
versus
hamilton
that
the
problem
of
road
regulation
was
one
which
is
peculiarly
within
the
province
of
a
state
because
there
in
maurer
versus
hamilton
the
state
was
dealing
with
a
local
condition,
a
local
problem.
but
more
than
that
in
maurer
versus
hamilton,
if
that
wasn't
enough,
and
i
think
it
was
enough
to
point
out
in
that
case
that
here
was
a
specific
reservations
of
the
state.
in
maurer
versus
hamilton,
there
was
a
very,
very
extensive
record,
an
extensive
record
with
respect
to
the
need
for
that
kind
of
safety
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
there
is
no,
no
testimony
in
our
case
with
respect
to
the
need
for
this
kind
of
contour
mudflap
within
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
david
axelrod
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
have
the
--
i
have
with
me
the
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
it's
the
--
it's
the
reference
of
section
--
mr.
david
axelrod
section
225
of
the
icc
act
allows
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
investigate
into
the
matter
of
the
need
for
sizes
and
weights
of
motor
vehicles
and
to
report
back
that
need
to
the
congress.
and
it
gives
no
authority
to
prescribe
any
state
regulations
with
respect
--
it
gives
no
authority
to
the
icc
to
prescribe
any
regulation
covering
sizes
and
weights.
in
other
words,
section
225
says
that
the
commission
may
investigate
and
shall
investigate
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
axelrod
exactly.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
basis
of
that
is
section
204
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
allows
the
commission
to
establish
reasonable
regulations
with
respect
to
safety
of
operation
and
equipment.
and
that's
the
quote
from
section
204.
now,
under
that
section,
the
icc
here,
regulated
with
respect
to
the
number
of
lights
on
vehicles,
regulated
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
--
regulated
with
respect
to
breaks
on
vehicles
but
they
don't
say
what
kind
of
a
break
shall
be
put
on
it.
it
doesn't
say
it
shall
be
one
kind
of
break
versus
another
kind.
they
say
a
break
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
a
breaking
purpose.
that
is
for
the
purpose
of
being
able
to
stop
the
vehicle.
in
this
case,
our
position
is
that
the
illinois
legislature
went
too
far
because
they
told
us
what
kind
of
a
contour
flap
we
were
required
to
have
on
our
vehicles
and
they
run
contrary
to
the
position
of
this
court
in
kelley
versus
washington
and
they
developed
this
question
of
conflict
and
they
developed
as
a
result
of
this
question
of
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
would
say
that
if
that
was
the
record
in
our
case,
we
might
be
in
trouble
before
this
court.
i
say,
however,
that
that
is
not
the
record
in
this
case
and
that's
where
this
case
is
deficient
from
the
standpoint
of
a
record
with
respect
to
the
contention
of
the
state.
now,
in
this
case
the
only
testimony
which
the
state
put
in
was
the
fact,
number
one,
that
illinois
was
a
wet
weather
state,
number
two,
that
this
contour
guard
precluded
some
splash
or
spray.
we
attempt
to
indicate
in
our
testimony
and
we
did
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
splash
and
spray
prevented
by
the
contour
guard
was
not
defective
as
the
splash
and
spray
which
we
were
able
to
cope
with
on
the
basis
of
our
straight
or
conventional
guards.
the
state
took
the
position
that
that
was
not
an
issue
because
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
this
court
has
in
this
area
resolved
the
questions
on
the
basis
of
way
and
resolving
the
conflict
as
between
the
state
and
the
national
interest.
and
for
example
in
the
case
of
terminal
railroad
association
--
terminal
railroad
association
versus
the
brotherhood
which
is
the
caboose
case
which
mr.
wines
relies
upon
as
being
his
case.
this
court
pointed
out
that
in
the
caboose
case
there,
there
was
no
evidence
with
respect
to
cause
in
the
record
there
as
to
how
it
would
affect
or
burden
interstate
commerce.
and
so
in
the
terminal
railroad
association
case,
this
court
because
there.
the
burden
question
was
not
carried
by
the
attackers
of
the
law.
this
court
has
found
the
law
was
good
based
upon
the
affirmative
position
and
evidence
of
the
state.
the
same
was
true
with
respect
to
barnwell
--
in
the
barnwell
case.
again,
south
carolina
prescribed
the
weight
and
length
limits
of
south
carolina.
and
this
court
found
there
that
was
an
extensive
record
developed
as
to
the
need
for
the
regulations
in
south
carolina
because,
there,
south
carolina
had
cope
with
the
problem
and
earlier
had
prescribed
higher
weight
loss
and
found
they
were
unsafe
but
that
isn't
this
case.
in
our
case,
not
only
do
we
have
no
finding
that
the
con
--
that
the
straight
mudflap
which
we
now
have
and
which
we
use
is
unsafe
or
not
safe
but
we
have
a
contrary
finding
that
the
contour
mudflap
is
more
dangerous
than
the
straight
conventional
mudflap
which
we
use
and
which
we
require
and
which
would
be
reinstated
if
the
contour
mudflap
law
was
not
doubt
because
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
think
so
because
i
don't
think
this
is
a
question
where
we
do
anything
except
to
allow
the
state
to
legislate
in
an
area.
i
think
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity
so
to
speak
that
goes
with
a
state
statute
at
the
outset.
but
that
presumption
of
validity
wouldn't
involve
a
specific
--
a
specific
findings
of
facts
such
as
we
have
in
this
case
and
the
presumption
of
validity
of
the
state
statute,
i
think
here
is
dissipated
immediately
when
it
runs
smack
into
the
principle
of
the
commerce
clause
because
i
think
commerce
clause
is
a
hurdle
which
any
state
statute
must
overcome
before
it
can
be
declared
good
and
where
an
attack
is
made
on
such
a
state
statute
under
the
commerce
clause
and
where
we
have
demonstrated
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
axelrod
it
would
appear
that
both
facts
ought
to
be
proved
in
this
respect.
i
think
that
the
first
inquiry
when
one
of
these
statutes
is
assailed
is
whether
or
not
the
statute
contributes
to
safety.
if
it
does
contribute
to
safety,
then
i
think
there's
a
second
question
to
be
decided,
whether
or
not
the
state
has
gone
too
far
and
in
its
safety
program
has
run
contrary
to
the
burden
clause.
now
with
respect
to
burden,
i
think
it
would
be
the
obligation
of
the
plaintiffs
attacking
the
law
such
as
we
to
show
burden
and
i
think
we
have
demonstratively
proved
the
question
of
undue
burden
in
this
case.
we
--
we've
done
i
think
much
greater
with
all
due
respect
than
in
southern
pacific
versus
arizona
and
much
greater
than
in
morgan
versus
virginia
upon
which
we
rely
also.
but
even
if
we
didn't
prove
our
burden
and
i
think
we
have,
i
think
the
state
lawfully
failed
to
prove
what
it
should
have
proved
namely
that
there
was
some
safety
need
for
this
kind
of
an
appliance.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
--
mr.
david
axelrod
--
completely
lacking
here.
mr.
david
axelrod
that's
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
the
state
--
mr.
david
axelrod
--
took
the
position
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
because
it
was
simply
a
question
of
legislative
judgment
and
they
took
the
position
actually
that
all
of
this
was
irrelevant
that
so
long
as
illinois
spoke
that
was
sanctity.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
david
axelrod
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
two
things
happened
here.
first,
that
we
carried
our
burden
of
showing
that
this
unduly
burdened
interstate
commerce.
but
in
addition
to
that
i
think
the
state
fell
down
in
its
burden
so
to
speak
of
attempting
to
show
that
this
was
a
safety
piece
of
equipment.
mr.
david
axelrod
with
respect
to
204
equipment,
they
have
required
certain
lights.
for
example,
they
have
specified
that
the
vehicle
should
carry
breaks
which
shall
be
--
which
shall
be
of
breaking
qualities
and
there
are
a
whole
series
of
requirements
with
respect
to
that
time,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
have
those
here
and
i
can
--
mr.
david
axelrod
they
are
not,
sir.
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes,
i
do
have
them.
i
--
i'm
only
--
at
the
moment,
i
--
mr.
david
axelrod
yes,
i'll
be
very
happy.
mr.
david
axelrod
intrastate?
mr.
david
axelrod
we
wouldn't
be
here,
your
honor.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
all
of
these
carriers
are
exclusively
interstate
carrier.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
would
be
the
case
because
there,
the
--
then
the
question
would
then
be
one
of
due
process
under
the
state
constitution.
this
is
not
--
mr.
david
axelrod
and
--
and
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
david
axelrod
[laughs]
mr.
david
axelrod
the
answer
of
that
question,
if
i
may,
would
be
simply
this.
the
state
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
in
the
two
cases,
warren
and
rudolph
versus
bibb,
held
the
statute
under
the
state
due
process
question
and
under
the
federal
due
process
question
to
be
a
reasonable
exercise
of
state
police
power.
but
this
is
not
our
question
here.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
that's
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
--
understanding
of
mr.
wines'
position
in
part
of
the
oral
argument
--
i
think
mr.
wines'
position
on
the
part
of
the
state
was
that
the
statute
here
burdened
interstate
commerce
but
he
did
not
concede,
as
i
understand
it
that
it
was
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
i
apologize.
i
perhaps
misunderstood
him.
and
part
of
my
argument
wasn't
predicated
on
that
proposition
but
i
do
want
to
set
the
record
the
straight.
yesterday,
the
question
was
asked
as
to
whether
or
not
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
promulgated
certain
safety
rules
and
regulations
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
equipment
that
should
be
upon
motor
vehicles
operating
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention,
if
i
may
please,
to
the
parts
and
accessories
provision
of
the
safety
rules
and
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
the
specific
question
was
the
extent
or
the
type
of
equipment
which
was
regulated
pursuant
to
these
safety
rules
and
regulations.
the
safety
rules
and
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
governed
the
movement
of
motor
vehicles
in
interstate
commerce
cover
generally
the
category
of
lighting
devices,
reflectors
and
electrical
equipment
and
there
follow
a
detailed
explanation
of
the
kind
of
electrical
equipment
and
lighting
devices
which
are
required.
there
also
follows
a
description
of
brakes
with
respect
to
their
adequacy
and
detailed
description
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
regulation
is
also
set
forth.
there
follows
also
a
discussion
and
a
requirement
concerning
the
windows,
the
glazing
and
the
window
construction
of
the
vehicles.
there
follows
a
requirement
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
fuel
systems
which
are
necessary.
there
follows
a
requirement
with
respect
to
coupling
devices
and
towing
methods.
and
then
there
is
a
subdivision
which
concerned
itself
with
miscellaneous
parts
and
accessories.
and
among
them
are
these,
tires,
heaters,
windshield
wiper,
defrosting
device,
mirrors,
horns,
speedometer,
exhaust
system,
protection
against
shifting
cargo,
flags
and
so
forth.
now,
the
commission
in
connection
with
--
mr.
david
axelrod
this
is
part
193,
justice
whittaker,
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
motor
carrier
safety
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
section
204
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
that
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
do
not
and
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
it
is
the
motor
carrier
safety
rules
and
regulations
pursuant
to
section
204
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
is
best
located,
if
i
may
suggest,
in
54
m.
c.
c.
337
which
is
the
interstate
commerce
commission
investigation
report
which
i
referred
to
yesterday
wherein
the
question
of
the
mudflaps
was
taken
under
consideration
by
the
commission
in
1952.
and
wherein
that
proceeding,
the
commission
determined
that
the
question
would
be
eliminated
for
the
purpose
of
prescribing
any
uniformity
with
respect
to
mudflaps.
and
the
proceeding
was
discontinued
on
that
basis.
in
other
words,
the
commission
there
had
before
it,
if
it
so
desired,
the
opportunity
to
prescribe
uniformly
with
respect
to
the
mudflap
requirement
but
decided
not
to
do
so.
mr.
david
axelrod
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
axelrod
it
did
not.
it
did
not,
justice
black,
but
--
mr.
david
axelrod
it
was
an
order.
it
was
--
what
--
what
is
known
as
an
investigation
proceeding.
the
safety
rules
and
regulations
from
time
to
time
are
amended
and
changed
as
developments
follow.
this
proceeding
in
1952
was
a
proposal
which
had
for
its
purpose
the
possibility
of
revising
the
safety
rules
and
regulations.
it
was
an
interim
step
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
1952,
there
should
be
any
further
revisions
of
the
safety
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
--
the
report
of
the
commission
is
not
clear
with
respect
to
it
but
undoubtedly,
the
subject
of
mudflaps
was
before
the
commission
because
it
determined
at
that
time,
in
1952,
that
there
was
no
need
to
cover
the
subject
matter.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
i
--
may
i
quote,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
this
is
the
report
of
the
commission.
“the
proposed
rule
on
wheel
flaps
has
been
eliminated
after
a
study
of
further
evidence
which
has
been
submitted.”
mr.
david
axelrod
yes
they
are,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
david
axelrod
there
was
such
submission.
however,
the
information
is
sketchy.
now,
in
connection
with
the
proceeding
--
mr.
david
axelrod
it
is
--
it
was
not
printed
with
respect
to
the
proceeding
itself.
mr.
david
axelrod
to
my
recollection,
it
did
not,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
i
am
saying
that
the
subject
matter
was
canvassed
and
the
report
doesn't
give
a
clear
indication
of
the
exact
mudflap
which
was
under
consideration
pro
and
con.
but
i'm
saying
that
the
subject
matter
was
canvassed.
and
may
i
point
out
further
that
in
the
same
decision
of
the
commission,
the
same
investigation
proceedings,
the
commission
went
on
to
further
indicate
that,
and
i
quote
from
it
please
if
i
may,
that
it
is
not
the
purpose
either
to
abrogate
the
present
state
or
local
laws
or
to
preempt
the
safety
field
to
the
exclusion
of
future
state
or
local
laws.
we
believe
that
states
and
subdivisions
should
be
allowed
to
enforce
their
laws
and
regulations
relating
to
safety
to
the
extent
that
compliance
therewith
by
the
person
subject
thereto
would
not
preclude
such
persons
from
fully
complying
with
the
regulations
prescribed
here.
in
other
words,
the
commission
went
on
to
say
that
although
it
was
prescribing
rules
and
regulations
with
respect
to
parts
and
accessories,
it
did
not
wish
to
abrogate,
if
it
could
or
i
doubt
that
it
could,
but
it
did
not
wish
to
abrogate
the
right
of
the
rule
--
of
the
states
to
require
safety
rules
not
inconsistent
with
its
own
federal
rule,
with
its
own
icc
rule.
now
then
--
mr.
david
axelrod
not
on
this
subject
matter.
mr.
david
axelrod
they
say
that
in
effect
but
they
say
it
on
a
modified
basis.
and
they
say
it
to
the
extent
that
they
do
not
wish
to
supplant
local
rules
not
inconsistent
with
their
rules.
they
take
the
position
that
where
they
have
covered
the
subject
matter,
they
have
preempted
the
feel.
mr.
david
axelrod
they
refuse
to
deal
with
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
on
the
theory
that
there
was
no
need
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
the
--
mr.
david
axelrod
the
--
the
question
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
need
for
a
safety
rule
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter,
having
in
mind
what
i've
indicated
earlier
in
my
argument
that
many
of
the
states
did
not
have
any
such
rule
whatsoever.
the
commission
therefore,
as
i
see
it,
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
rule
by
it,
in
connection
with
the
subject
matter
at
this
time.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
and
we're
--
i'm
saying
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
axelrod
because
apparent
--
mr.
david
axelrod
because
--
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct.
and
i
say
that
because
apparently,
the
local
rules
existing
then
and
the
contour
statute
was
not
then
in
effect,
were
sufficient.
mr.
david
axelrod
no,
it
was
not.
the
contour
statute
was
passed
in
1955
and
amended
in
1957.
and
we're
challenging
the
1957
act.
the
icc
report
was
in
1952.
at
that
time,
the
states
have
a
uniform
rule
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
a
mudflap,
it
was
the
straight
mudflap.
and
all
states
authorized
the
use
of
the
straight
mudflaps.
so
that
at
that
time,
the
commission
knowing
the
rules
in
existence
in
the
various
states,
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
need
to
cover
the
subject
matter.
mr.
david
axelrod
there
was
--
mr.
david
axelrod
there
was
no
conflict,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
say
this
that
we're
not
concerned
here
with
any
question
of
preemption
of
the
field.
we
take
no
position
that
because
the
icc
had
the
power
but
didn't
exercise
it,
that
therefore,
the
state
cannot
exercise
a
safety
rule.
we
don't
--
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
there
is
a
question
of
preemption
of
a
field
here.
our
entire
position
is
that
this
statute
is
an
undue
and
unreasonable
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and
as
we
see
it,
that
is
the
sole
issue
in
this
case.
we're
not
arguing
preemption.
mr.
david
axelrod
it
would
be
--
yes,
it
would
be
a
much
lesser
--
we
would
say
that
it
was
not
a
violation
because
the
state
or
arkansas
in
its
rules
and
regulations,
promulgated
the
kind
of
a
rule
which
was
uniform
to
the
25
other
states
which
had
a
similar
rule.
in
other
words,
arkansas,
its
requirement
was
for
a
straight
mudflap.
this
was
the
same
requirement
which
would
allow
a
vehicle
licensed
and
equipped
in
arkansas
to
be
legal
in
every
other
state
but
the
state
of
illinois
under
the
contour
mudflap
statute.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct.
other
states
did
--
mr.
david
axelrod
arkansas
did
make
such,
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
and
so
did
illinois.
but
--
mr.
david
axelrod
--
but
arkansas
followed
suit
after
illinois.
illinois
started
the
ball
by
its
57th
amendment.
arkansas
followed
afterward
presumably
on
the
theory
that
if
illinois
was
going
to
molest
arkansas
vehicles,
arkansas
would
do
the
same
to
illinois
vehicles.
and
so,
it
began
to
develop
into
a
sort
of
a
--
of
a
feud
between
arkansas
and
illinois,
illinois
being
the
proponent.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
--
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
in
order
--
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
how
they
should
be
put
on
but
the
testimony
in
the
record
show
that
this
kind
of
a
flap
can
only
be
put
on
either
on
the
basis
of
it
being
welded
or
if
it
would
be
bolted,
it
would
have
to
be
bolted
on
the
basis
of
having
somebody
go
to
the
inside
of
the
vehicle
in
order
to
put
the
bolt
on
the
vehicle
for
the
purpose
of
affixing
the
flap.
and
so
either
way
whether
it's
welded
or
bolted,
the
point
is
not
whether
they
could
be
put
on
at
the
beginning.
the
point
is
whether
or
not
the
vehicle
could
be
stopped
at
the
state
line
of
illinois.
and
at
that
point,
because
of
the
owner
requirement,
could
somebody
put
on
a
mudflap
as
a
contoured
kind
at
--
at
the
state
line?
and
the
point
we
argued
and
showed
was
that
this
was
impossible
and
the
three-judge
court
so
found
that
it
couldn't
be
done,
it
was
impracticable,
and
we
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
unsafe
and
--
unsafe
and
contrary
to
the
rules
because
nobody
could
enter
a
trailer
that
was
carrying
explosives
for
the
purpose
of
either
opening
the
trailer
and
these
trailers
move
under
seal.
they
move
close.
they
move
pursuant
to
government
orders.
and
nobody
could
go
into
the
inside
of
the
trailer
either
to
bolt
or
to
weld
this
kind
of
a
flap
onto
it.
mr.
david
axelrod
mr.
justice
whittaker,
this
isn't
a
case
relating
to
the
use
of
the
state
highway.
this
is
a
case
which
relates
to
the
right
of
a
state
to
provide
only
a
safety
accessory.
there
is
a
vital
distinction
as
we
see
it
between
the
use
of
a
state
highway
and
an
accessory
to
be
placed
upon
a
vehicle
which
uses
the
state
highway.
and
that
distinction
is
pointed
out
in
maurer
versus
--
in
the
maurer
case,
maurer
v.
hamilton
where
the
--
this
court
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
the
right
of
the
state
to
legislate
with
respect
to
size
and
width
and
weight.
that
means
the
right
to
use
the
state
highway.
and
that
right
is
predicated
upon
the
reservation
to
the
state
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
section
225
specifically
of
a
delegated
and
reserved
right
to
the
state
to
prescribe
the
weight,
height
and
road
condition.
i'm
trying
to
point
out
the
distinction
as
i
see
it
in
connection
with
your
question.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
exhibits
1
and
3
in
this
record
contain
pictures
of
the
contour
mudflap
and
the
straight
mudflap.
i'm
sorry,
but
i
presume
those
--
those
exhibits
--
they're
pictorial
exhibits,
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
may
not
be
in
front
of
you.
but
the
contour
mudflap
is
made
of
either
a
metal
or
a
flexible
material
which
is
designed
to
contour
the
tire.
it
in
effect
shrouds
the
tire.
whereas,
the
straight
mudflap
is
a
mudflap
which
is
affixed
at
the
end
of
the
trailer
and
is
further
removed
from
the
tire
wheel.
so
that
perhaps
--
if
you
seen
some
vehicles
operating
on
a
highway,
you
probably
noticed
that
of
the
back
of
the
trailer,
there
are
mudflaps
hanging
down
almost
to
the
roadway.
mr.
david
axelrod
these
are
made
of
rubber
material
and
they're
flexible.
and
--
we
point
it
out
in
--
in
this
connection.i
think
it
might
be
interesting.
in
this
record,
the
indication
shows,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
these
contour
flaps,
because
they
are
required
by
the
statute,
the
contours
of
the
tire
are
so
close
to
it
that
the
result
is
a
very,
very
great
brake
fade
characteristic.
in
other
words,
it
suffocates
the
heat.
it
doesn't
allow
the
heat
to
dissipate.
and
we've
shown
in
this
record
here
where
the
result
of
the
contour
is
to
create
a
danger
with
respect
to
the
efficiency
of
brake.
and
we
have
had
engineers
testify
in
this
case.
and
the
record
so
show
that
there
result
a
brake
fade.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
question
is
not
on
the
record.
my
answer
is
yes
to
your
question,
mr,
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
answer
is
yes
though
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
witnesses
who
testified
for
the
state
of
illinois
were
the
manufacturers
and
one
was
based
in
indiana.
one
was
based
in,
i
think,
illinois
but
those
where
the
people
who
testified
in
support
of
the
case
for
the
state
in
addition
to
this
--
on
the
other
testimony.
the
state
put
in
reference
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
wet
weather
state.
i
indicated
that
yesterday.
they
did
it
by
simply
showing
a
chart
of
the
fact
that
so
many
days
during
the
year
in
illinois,
it
would
rain
or
there
would
be
snow.
that
plus
the
fact
that
somebody
took
the
position,
the
manufacturer,
that
if
this
could
be
put
on
and
not
too
long
a
period
of
time.
that's
what
the
extent
characteristically
of
the
kind
of
evidence
which
we
have
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
--
the
straight?
mr.
david
axelrod
the
straight
is
not.
and
many
--
many
manufacturers
are
making
the
straight
guard.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
do
not
know.
the
last
pronouncement
was
in
1952.
it
may
or
may
not
be
that
they
were
taken
under
consideration.
but,
we
--
i
would
like
to
say
this
in
response
to
your
question.
i
would
say
that
the
state
--
the
commission
would
not
be
interested
for
the
reason
that
our
record
very
carefully
describes
the
dangers
and
the
unsafe
characteristics
of
the
contour
mudflap.
we
have
safety
engineers
who
said
that
they
would
not
voluntarily
put
this
kind
of
equipment
on
their
vehicles
unless
they
were
forced
to.
and
they
pointed
out
that
this
was
a
thing
which
was
dangerous,
not
just
safe.
in
other
words,
they
also
pointed
out
simultaneously
that
wherever
they
could
find
anything
else
that
was
safe
for
their
vehicles,
and
they
were
very
proud
of
their
safety
records,
they
would
put
it
on
without
respect
to
the
question
of
cost.but
here,
they
said,
"unless
we
are
required
to.
we
will
not
put
them
on.”
mr.
david
axelrod
i
would
doubt
of
the
right
of
the
commission
to
make
a
positive
affirmation
of
that
sort.
we
could
be
more
in
the
nature
of
a
court
decree.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes
i
--
mr.
david
axelrod
yes
they
could.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
think
they
would
--
if
they
--
if
they
did
it
in
the
fashion
that
you
indicate,
they
would
be
usurping
the
power
of
this
court
or
the
power
of
a
federal
court
under
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
their
power
is
one
of
a
right
to
do
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
as
a
corollary
thereto,
they
would
have
the
right
to
say
that
a
specific
kind
was
unsafe
because,
then
we
would
be
running
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
icc's
power
could
supersede
the
right
of
a
state
legislature.
and
i
doubt
whether
the
commission
would
think
that
it
had
the
power
to
say
to
a
state
legislature,
“that
which
you
have
prescribed
is
unsafe.”
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct.
you
mean
the
wet
--
you
mean
the
dry
weather
states?
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
i
don't
think
that
they
have
the
right
to
go
that
far.
i
think
--
i
don't
think
it
follows
as
a
necessary
corollary.
mr.
david
axelrod
federal
government.
mr.
david
axelrod
with
those
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
i
think,
at
that
point,
i
think
they
would
then
be
usurping
of
the
legislative
power
of
the
state
at
that
point.
i
don't
think
that
their
power
--
their
power
would
exceed
--
would
get
to
that
point.
mr.
david
axelrod
no,
mr.
justice
warren.
this
court
has
held
that
the
power
of
a
state
with
respect
to
safety
is
one
that
must
be
--
that
must
face
the
constitutional
hurdle
of
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
the
reserve
power
of
a
state
can
be
invalidated
by
the
commerce
clause,
that
the
clause
is
a
bulwark
of
protection
against
the
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
legislate
with
respect
to
burdening
interstate
commerce.
mr.
david
axelrod
and
--
mr.
david
axelrod
that
is
correct
but
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
at
the
time
when
it
did
not
do
that
that
had
any
question
of
conflict.
in
other
words,
in
1952,
when
the
commission
spoke
on
the
subject,
there
was
no
question.
there
was
no
conflict
of
questions.
we're
talking
here
in
terms
of
a
subject
matter
that
requires
uniformity
if
there
is
to
be
action.
but
if
there
isn't
uniformity,
then
absent
to
any
federal
action.
we
take
the
position
that
the
commerce
clause
stand.
mr.
david
axelrod
that
it
--
mr.
david
axelrod
our
position
is
that
the
illinois
legislature
cannot,
not
that
the
icc
could
not.
our
position
is
that
beyond
our
legislature
could
not
authorize
a
safety
appliance
which
would
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce.
mr.
david
axelrod
and
the
state
supreme
court
has
also
pointed
out
in
its
decision
sustaining
the
law
that
it
did
not
concern
itself
with
the
burden
question.
and
may
i
quote
from
the
state
supreme
court
in
rudolph
versus
bibb,
the
state
supreme
court
said,
“no
question
is
raised
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.”
and
further,
the
state
supreme
court,
after
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
in
our
case,
acknowledged
that
fact
and
i
referred
to
pages
36
and
37
of
the
appellant's
brief
where
the
state
supreme
court
said,
“it
is
difficult
to
see
why
the
specified
splash
guard
should
be
required
on
foreign
vehicles
passing
through
this
state
citing
navajo
versus
bibb
our
three-judge
court
decision.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
are
not.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
rely
on
the
southern-pacific
and
morgan
versus
virginia.
on
those
two
cases,
the
state
relied
to
maurer
versus
hamilton
and
the
barnwell
case.
the
state
in
its
reply
brief
took
the
position
that
another
case
which
it
cited
the
terminal
railroad
association
brief
was
more
applicable
to
our
facts
than
the
south
--
southern
pacific-arizona
case.
i've
distinguished
that
yesterday
by
pointing
out
that
in
the
terminal
case
which
was
the
caboose
case,
there
was
no
record
there
with
respect
to
the
cost
on
the
burden
question.
but
in
the
terminal
railroad
case,
interestingly
enough,
there
is
a
discussion
of
another
case
by
way
of
a
footnote
known
as
the
south
covington
case.
it
was
a
case
involving
a
--
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
covington
which
attempted
to
regulate
the
number
of
trains
which
would
have
to
operate
between
covington
and
--
covington
and
cincinnati.
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
statute
was
bad
because
it
conflicted
with
cincinnati.
and
therefore,
because
of
the
conflict
question,
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
was
invited
and
struck
that
statute
down.
that
case,
we
say
supports
our
position
and
is
in
further
support
of
morgan
and
southern
pacific.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
many.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
will
answer
that
no
because
they
took
the
position
that
that
issue
was
irrelevant.
that
the
sole
issue
was
the
right
of
the
state
legislature
to
act
and
that
the
state
legislative
act
carried
with
it
a
presumption
of
validity.
and
they
generally
took
the
position
that
that
was
not
involved
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
much
of
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lower
court
was
admitted.
the
basis
of
the
interstate
commerce
interchanged
operations
and
the
like.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
don't
know
why
they
did
or
didn't
--
mr.
david
axelrod
we
--
we
ans
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well
--
mr.
david
axelrod
we
take
the
position
that
the
question
of
safety
before
the
court
was
in
issue
and
we
put
testimony
in
--
on
that
subject.
mr.
david
axelrod
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
think
that
they
read
southern
pacific
and
morgan
versus
virginia
properly.
i
don't
think
that
the
state
in
trying
its
case
tried
it
properly
under
the
facts
in
morgan
and
southern
pacific.
we
think
we
did.
we
think
we've
adhere
to
the
principles
annunciated
in
morgan
and
southern
pacific.
the
lower
court
thought
so
because
it
distinguished
morgan
and
southern
pacific
from
maurer
and
barnwell
in
a
very
interesting
discussion.
and
i
think
that
the
lower
court
accurately
summarized
the
law
applicable
to
the
facts.
we
think
it
was
a
commendable
opinion
with
respect
to
a
dissertation
upon
the
subject.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
would
think
that
they
should
be.
it
would
be
foreclosed.
mr.
david
axelrod
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
pitched
their
case
on
an
erroneous
concept
of
the
law.
on
the
concept
of
the
law
that
this
court
does
not
have
the
right
to
resolve,
the
conflicting
question
of
state
versus
national
interest.
they
take
the
position
this
court
doesn't
have
that
right.
we
say
this
court
has
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
they
attempted
to
prove
by
some
evidence
that
it
was
a
safety
measure.
they
fell
short
of
that
proof.
in
fact,
their
proof
fell
fat
--
flat
on
its
face
because
the
contrary
was
shown.
so
they
attempted
to
justify
it
a
little
bit
but
they
didn't
go
far
enough.
the
statute
went
too
far
but
their
evidence
didn't
go
far
enough.
and
our
point
is,
that
they
must
have
attempted
to
show
a
little
bit
that
there
was
safety
but
--
mr.
david
axelrod
they
tried
but
fail.
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
i
think
they'd
have
their
day
in
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
david
axelrod
well
--
mr.
david
axelrod
it
isn't
being
left
because
our
record
demonstrates
the
--
mr.
david
axelrod
but
i
can
--
mr.
david
axelrod
but
i
can
try
their
case
for
them.
we
can't
tell
them
how
to
try
their
case
or
put
their
proof
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
axelrod
they
are
not
to
be
allowed
to
try
the
case
twice
after
we've
shown
the
error
of
their
ways
to
them.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
say
that
the
fact
question
is
controlling
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
all
of
these
cases,
there
is
no
absolute
rule.
the
question
is
when
a
fact,
in
each
case
and
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
resolve
the
difference
between
the
national
and
the
local
interest.
and
this
court
has
done
so
in
the
cases
which
we
rely
on.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
trial
court
never
precluded
from
the
--
the
state
from
putting
in
any
testimony.
it
was
simply
a
voluntary
position
on
the
part
of
the
state.
they
thought
they
were
doing
it
the
right
way.
mr.
david
axelrod
but
--
but
nobody
precluded
them.
no
evidence
was
excluded
by
the
court.
now
the
state
shows
not
to
put
the
testimony
in.
the
little
they
put
in
just
wasn't
sufficient.
mr.
david
axelrod
right.
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
all
this
court
has
to
do,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts
which
it
found.
it
found
the
facts
specifically.
this
court,
i
submit,
should
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
and
determine
whether
or
not
its
application
to
the
law
--
of
the
law
to
the
facts
was
correct.
we
submit
it
was
--
mr.
david
axelrod
if
this
court
should
hold
it
to
be
a
burden,
it
could
not
enact
such
a
statute.
mr.
david
axelrod
it
only
takes
the
pronouncement
of
this
court.
mr.
david
axelrod
bus
cases.
mr.
david
axelrod
bus
case.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
have
all
of
that.
plus,
in
this
record
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
they
--
mr.
david
axelrod
perhaps
they
couldn't
contest
the
facts
and
that's
why
they
didn't
contest
the
facts.
mr.
david
axelrod
they
had
every
right
to
deny
them.
if
they
wanted
to,
they
could
have.
now,
they
had
every
right
to
do
so.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
axelrod
no.
that
is
not
one
of
our
main
points.
mr.
david
axelrod
no.
we
have
a
series
of
points
on
the
burden
and
they're
all
out
--
mr.
david
axelrod
it
does
not,
it
doesn't
say
how.
but
the
testimony
shows
how
it
could
only
be
affixed.
but
we
have
a
series
of
points
on
burden
and
there're
a
number
of
them.
the
larger
point
is
the
delays
and
the
insurmountable
objects
that
would
be
involved
in
connection
with
the
attempt
to
move
trailers
by
interchange
from
california
to
new
york
through
illinois
where
a
carrier
with
a
trailer
in
california
would
be
required
under
the
statute
to
have
his
california
trailer
start
out
with
a
contour-equipped
trailer
so
that
it
could
go
through
illinois
to
get
to
the
state
of
new
york.
that
trailer
carrying
explosives,
that
trailer
carrying
perishables
which
is
the
lifeline
of
the
truck
business,
is
the
kind
of
burden
that
would
be
involved
in
this
case
among
other
things.
so,
we
have
a
whole
series
of
facts
upon
which
we
rely
for
the
purpose
of
burden.
mr.
david
axelrod
it
would
have
been
except
that
the
problem
was
never
a
practical
or
a
real
one
with
any
of
the
states
because
all
of
the
statutes
were
either
uniformed
or
there
were
no
statutes.
and
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
they
were
uniformed,
all
of
the
vehicles
carried
a
straight
flap
which
was
good
all
over.
mr.
david
axelrod
they
did
and
we
did.
and
the
court
found
the
facts
in
our
favor
as
our
witnesses
testified
to
it.
and
there's
a
specific
finding
of
fact
number
24,
a
series
of
findings
beginning
with
finding
number
22
through
30
of
the
lower
court
opinion,
mr.
justice
clark,
which
specifically
covers
that
subject
matter.
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
the
welding
--
the
welding
was
simply
the
fact
that
gave
rise
to
the
finding
but
the
court
in
our
case
indicated
here
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i'm
referring
to
finding
--
yes,
finding
21.
that
it
would
be
impossible
in
those
cases
and
impractical
in
others
for
plaintiffs
to
equip
trailers
obtained
by
interlining
of
the
splash
guard
required
by
illinois.
finding
25
refers
to
the
danger.
mr.
david
axelrod
thank
you.
mr.
david
axelrod
54
m.
c.
c.
54.
mr.
david
axelrod
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
axelrod
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
(inaudible)
mr.
david
axelrod
it
is
54-337.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
i'm
sorry.
