mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
illinois
with
a
three-judge
bench
has
held
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
an
illinois
statute
requiring
the
equipment
of
trucks
and
trailers
travelling
over
illinois
highways
with
contour
type
mudguards
meeting
specifications
enacted
by
the
statute.
the
court
held
only
that
the
requirements
of
the
statute
imposed
an
unreasonable
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
and
enjoined
the
effect
of
the
act
with
respect
to
that
commerce.
in
two
other
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
rudolph
express
company
case
and
a
later
case,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
held
the
instant
measure
reasonable
and
not
violative
of
due
process
on
the
ground
of
its
unreasonable
character.
your
honors
have
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
the
cause
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
illinois.
the
district
court
has
summarized
the
requirements
of
the
statute
and
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
i
should
like
to
quote
that
summary
since
its
precise
terms
are
important
and
i
am
reading
from
page
6
of
appellant's
brief
which
quotes
the
language
of
the
district
court.
specifications,
the
court
says,
require
that
the
splash
guards,
one,
contour
under
the
wheel,
two,
cover
the
top
90
degrees
of
the
rear
180
degrees
with
an
exception
of
vehicles
of
less
than
five
inches
counts
from
requiring
a
contour
within
10
inches
of
the
body.
so
they
extend
down
within
10
inches
of
the
ground
that
they
have
a
lip
or
plunge
of
two
inches
upon
the
outside
and
retain
general
parallel
condition
under
all
operating
conditions
remotely
required
by
the
statute
not
more
than
six
inches
from
the
truck
when
fully
loaded.
the
district
court
premised
its
conclusion
of
unreasonable
violation
--
unreasonable
burdening
of
interstate
commerce
upon
that
court's
finding
that
no
other
state
has
a
similar
requirement
that
arkansas
has
a
recent
administrative
regulation
requiring
a
flap
or
--
or
apron
type
mudguard
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
illinois
type
of
mudguard
upon
a
finding
that
it
would
unreasonably
burden
interstate
commerce
to
equip
entering
vehicles
with
this
mudguard
when
they're
not
required
in
other
states
and
upon
a
declaration
that
--
based
on
conflicting
evidence
we
say
that
there
is
some
danger
that
this
contour
type
of
mudguard
is
likely
to
fall
off
and
create
a
hazard
to
oncoming
traffic
in
other
lanes.
it
is
the
respectful
but
honest
position
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
major
--
major
stricken
down
by
the
district
court
embodies
and
enacts
a
reasonable
exercise
of
illinois'
police
power
over
her
highways
and
with
respect
to
vehicles
moving
within
her
borders.
the
district
court's
opinion
does
not,
in
the
findings,
do
not
make
mention
of
the
evidence
which
i
believe
i
can
say
is
undisputed
in
the
record
that
a
contour
splash
guard
that
is
the
type
required
by
the
illinois
law
unlike
a
flap
or
apron
type
mudguard
will
throw
debris
down
instead
of
out.
there
is
a
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
contour
type
of
mudguard
provided
by
the
illinois
statute
does
cause
debris
to
be
thrown
down.
the
evidence
shows
that
to
plan
an
appreciating
vehicle
is
equipped
with
inadequate
mudguards,
those
mudguards
don't
prevent
debris
from
flying
into
the
--
a
windshield
of
a
following
vehicle
and
that
the
driver
of
the
following
vehicle
tends
to
lose
control
of
this
car.
it
tends
to
go
off
the
road
and
accidents
ensue.
now,
it's
significant
that
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
don't
cite
a
single
decision
of
this
court
and
our
own
research
indicate
that
they
can't
cite
a
decision
of
this
court
in
which
this
court
has
ever
stricken
down
a
state
law
fixing
the
requirements
for
vehicles
traveling
upon
state
constructed
highways.
i
mean
automotive
vehicles.
the
three
leading
cases
sustaining
such
regulation
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
they
made
such
a
finding.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
that
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
--
i
think
that
your
honors
should
take
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
as
being
entitled
to
great
weight
but
i
don't
think
that
they
must
be
given
conclusive
validity
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
because
if
your
honors
find
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
find
on
the
consideration
of
the
entire
record
as
we
submit
that
you
should,
that
there
is
an
advantage
to
this
mudguard
then
the
legislative
determination
should
prevail.
this
case
is
a
little
different,
your
honors
from
the
ordinary
case
that
comes
to
this
court
with
findings
of
fact
because
it
also
comes
to
this
court
with
at
least
implicit
declarations
of
fact
by
a
states
legislature.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
would
like
to
answer
your
honor's
question
in
this
way
if
i
may.
what
are
called
findings
of
fact
in
this
case?
in
reality
embodies
--
embodiments
of
judgment
as
to
reasonableness.
there
are
no
"who
has
the
lighter
questions"
in
this
case
of
which
i
am
aware.
there
is
no
question
of
the
credibility
of
witnesses.
i
don't
understand
that
anybody
is
accused
of
perjury.
mr.
william
c.
wines
expert
and
lay
testimony
against
the
judgment
of
illinois'
general
assembly.
now,
the
interesting
area
of
focus
prompted
by
your
honor's
suggestion
is
this
as
this
court
has
many
times
declared.
it
isn't
enough
that
a
measure
be
fairly
debatable
if
it's
within
the
arena
of
debate
as
to
its
reasonableness.
it's
a
matter
for
the
state
legislature
in
the
case
of
a
state
act
or
congress
in
the
act
in
case
of
a
federal
act.
so
that
the
real
question
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
on
which
the
lower
court
must
say
that
the
illinois
legislature
acted
so
unreasonably
that
there
it
will
be
stricken
down
and
i
think
that
that
means
that
rule
52
(a)
does
not
have
the
same
scope
in
this
type
of
case
that
it
would
in
--
say
a
suit
for
specific
performance
or
a
tax
case
or
some
case
where
there
weren't
a
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
a
sovereign
legislature.
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
in
this
case.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
the
district
court
did
find
that
this
measure
is
likely
to
cause
accidents
and
that
it
imposes
an
unreasonable
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
the
loss
--
these
facts
are
undisputed.
the
law
applies
not
only
to
tractor
--
trucks
but
to
trailers
that
are
attest
to
tractors
and
many
times
a
tractor
will
start
out
with
one
trailer
and
the
trailer
will
be
shifted
around
to
another
tractor
just
as
freight
cars
are
shunted
from
one
line
to
another
in
interstate
commerce
so
that
there
is
--
there
is
no
doubt
to
the
burden
imposed
upon
these
trailers
and
trucks
that
come
in
a
substantial
one
but
our
evidence
shows,
i
think
i
can
say
without
dispute,
that
this
type
of
mudguard
can
be
installed
by
a
man
having
no
previous
experience
in
about
an
hour
and
it
can
be
installed
for
about,
i
believe
certain
hours.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
is
an
exception
for
trucks
traveling
holy
within
the
municipality
where
there
isn't
the
--
the
danger
but
this
is
not
to
aim
discriminatorily
at
interstate
commerce.
no,
your
honor.
yes,
illinois
--
illinois
trucking
industry,
in
general,
is
required
to
comply
with
this
law
and
it
has
assailed
the
law
as
unreasonable
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that's
twice
held
that
measured
to
be
reasonable
exercise
of
the
police
power
and
not
violative
of
due
process.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
now,
your
honor,
it
was
first
passed
in
1955.
in
1957,
it
was
amended
in
ways
that
aren't
challenged
by
the
plaintiffs
or
relied
upon
by
the
defendant.
generally,
they
ameliorate
its
provisions
a
little
bit
but
both
the
1955
and
the
1957
version
of
the
enactment
have
been
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
as
against
the
contention
that
it
denies
due
process.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
cases
that
we
cite
are
not
numerous,
we've
cite
these
court's
pleading
decisions
in
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
motor
vehicles
by
state
legislatures
or
other
authorities.
the
first
case
on
which
we
rely
is
south
carolina
highway
department
against
barnwell
brothers
in
303
united
states.
in
that
case,
the
district
--
three-judge
district
court
held
invalid
the
provisions
of
the
south
carolina
statute
that
prohibited
the
use
on
state
highways
of
motor
trucks
and
semi-trailer
motor
trucks
whose
width
exceeds
90
inches
and
whose
weight
including
loads
exceeds
20,000
pounds.
the
district
court
held
that
that
was
an
unreasonable
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce.
this
court
reversed.
in
maurer
against
hamilton,
309
u.s.,
this
court
sustained
a
pennsylvania
regulation
briefly
summarized
in
the
language
of
this
court
as
"prohibiting
the
operation
over
its
highways
of
any
more
vehicles
carrying
any
other
vehicle
over
the
head
of
the
operator
of
such
vehicle."
this
court
held
that
the
measure
was
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
state's
police
power.
and
in
the
case
of
sproles
against
binford
in
286
united
states,
this
court
upheld
as
to
interstate
commerce,
a
provision
of
the
motor
vehicle
of
after
texas
prohibiting
the
operation
on
any
highway
of
a
vehicle
to
define
exceeding
stated
limitations
of
size
or
any
vehicle
not
constructed
or
equipped
as
required
and
also
the
transportation
of
load
exceeding
the
dimensions
in
which
prescribed.
we
think
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
say
they
were,
your
honor.
there
--
there
was
a
finding
of
unreasonableness.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
i
meant
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
that.
i
think
i
did
in
opening
my
statement
that
they
said
that
these
were
likely
to
become
detached
and
create
hazard.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
called
a
state
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
most
of
them,
i
would
say,
were
interested
persons
in
the
trucking
industry.
employees
of
the
trucking
companies
and
illinois
called
a
state
policeman
and
a
witness
who
has
installed
these
mudguards.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
the
assistant
then
handling
the
case
made
an
objection.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
--
the
assistant
--
i
didn't
handle
this
case
in
the
trial
court,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
the
--
the
assistant
who
handle
this
case
in
the
trial
court
took
the
position
that
the
question
of
reasonableness
was
conclusively
one
for
the
legislature
and
not
for
the
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
it
is
not.
we
say
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
we
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
when
all
of
the
testimony
is
considered
and
the
pronouncements
of
the
district
court
are
conceded,
this
court
should
hold
that
the
question
is
one
or
within
the
ambit
of
the
discretionary
power
of
the
legislature
of
illinois.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
we
do
that,
your
honor.
we
do
say
this
that
--
that
the
question
is
one
for
the
legislature.
and
that
there
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
point
is
made.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
know
you
--
i
know
you
don't,
your
honor.
that
point
is
made
in
the
record
and
in
the
brief,
but
we
also
say
that
if
you
do
consider
it,
you
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
matter
is
when
we
didn't
--
the
--
the
discretion
of
the
legislature.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
is
a
great
difference,
your
honor.
it's
one
that
i
perceive
of
course
but
i
say
no
matter
which
approach
is
used,
we
are
to
prevail.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
--
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
figurative
way
of
expressing.
it
no
doubt
suggests
the
result
that
we're
requesting
but
we
don't
maintain
that
the
rule
has
any
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
any
--
any
application
to
the
legislature.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
appellees
are
unable
to
cite
any
cases
where
this
court
has
invalidated
a
state
law
or
regulation
applying
to
trucks
or
motor
vehicles
moving
on
highways
constructed
by
the
state
at
its
expense.
their
chief
reliance
is
on
the
southern
pacific
railroad
company
case
in
which
your
honors
did
invalidate
a
car
--
a
requirement
limiting
the
length
of
freight
trains.
we
say
that
that
case
is
distinguishable
on
many
grounds
for
one
thing
after
the
violation
of
the
statute
by
the
railroad.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
promulgated
a
regulation
invalidating
all
such
state
statutes
and
while
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
the
regulation
didn't
apply
because
it
wasn't
enforced
at
the
time
of
the
violation.
it
was
highly
persuasive.
in
the
second
place,
it
wasn't
a
highway
that
the
state
had
built
in
its
own
expense
and
we
say
that
if
railroad
cases
are
to
be
invoked,
far
more
nearly
in
point
is
the
terminal
railroad
case
against
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
in
which
this
court
by
unanimous
opinion
held
valid
a
regulation
of
the
illinois
commerce
commission
requiring
the
railroad
to
put
cabooses
on
trains
although
these
cabooses
moved
over
to
mississippi
river
over
bridges,
the
ids
and
other
bridges
in
the
mississippi
river
and
there
was
no
practically
feasible
method
of
detaching
the
caboose
at
the
margins
of
the
state
so
that
the
effect
of
the
order
was
to
require
them
to
translate
--
to
transport
the
cabooses
into
the
city
of
st.
louis
and
from
the
city
of
st.
louis
back
into
illinois
and
this
court
unanimously
held
that
that
was
not
an
unreasonable
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
say
that
the
matter
was
one
for
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
unless
there
was
clear
demonstration
that
the
legislatures
--
a
determination
was
so
errantly
unreasonable.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
this
court
has
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
is.
i
--
i've
already
conceded
that
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
in
this
case
is
a
substantial
one.
it
would
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
say
that
the
legislative
determination
that
the
safety,
the
preservation
of
life
embodies
--
and
property
on
illinois
highways,
embodies
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
police
power
and
does
not
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
was
going
to
come
to
the
point
that
the
appellants
make.
they
say
that
if
there
is
to
be
regulation
of
the
type
of
mudguards
to
be
use
on
trucks,
it
should
be
uniform
and
should
be
either
enacted
directly
by
congress
or
congress
should
authorize
a
promulgation
of
regulations
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
some
of
the
commission.
we
say
that
in
this
case,
until
congress
acts,
the
states
may
require
reasonable
equipment.
now
there
is
in
this
case
a
matter
of
the
arkansas
regulation.
there
was
no
evidence,
whatever
introduced,
to
show
the
reason
for
the
arkansas
regulation
which
requires
a
flap
type
of
mudguard
and
if
it's
necessary
to
comply
with
different
types
of
mudguards
and
different
types
--
in
different
states
that
compliance
can
be
affected
at
the
states'
borders.
it's
a
respectful
submission
of
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
that
the
district
court
erred
in
striking
down
this
act
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
say
so
far
as
--
i
would
--
i
say
it's
assumed
--
it
was
assumed
by
the
district
court
that
it
would.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
detailed
check
of
every
regulation
in
every
state.
but
the
case
has
been
argued
on
--
all
the
way
through
on
the
assumption
that
--
that
it
would.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
to
reply.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
say
this
in
the
first
place.
the
southern
pacific
case
was
not
dealing
with
roads
built
by
a
state.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
think
we
do
but
we
build
those
roads
ourselves
and
primarily
we
say
--
a
state
has
greater
power
over
their
own
roads
than
she
does
over
railroads.
mr.
william
c.
wines
not
entirely,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
have
charged
them
and
we
--
and
we
design
them.
we
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
we
construct
them.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
say
that
when
the
state
builds
a
street
or
a
road
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
we
say
partly
--
we
say
it
builds
it
with
partly
state
funds
and
partly
federal
funds
that
adheres
more
control
over
that
highway
than
it
does
over
a
railroad
that
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
it
can
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
there's
--
there's
a
reasonable
--
it
can
impose
any
burden
on
either
a
railroad
or
a
public
highway
that
is
not
unreasonable
but
the
test
of
reasonableness
is
not
the
same
with
respect
of
the
two
types
of
highways.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
quite
think
--
i
think
the
test
of
reasonableness
is
different,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
so.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
no.
if
--
if
there
were
any,
they
would
displace
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
they
--
they
have
licenses
for
revenue,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
all
of
these
plaintiffs
operate
under
the
motor
carrier
act
which
has
not
--
and
there
are
--
there
are
no
regulations.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
inclined
to
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
to
tell
--
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
don't
know.
and
i'm
inclined
to
think
they
could.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
inclined
to
think
so.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
don't
think
so.
we
discussed
that
in
our
brief
and
the
only
cases
that
have
reached
this
court
where
that
argument
has
been
made
as
to
motor
trucks
have
not
sustained.
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
reply.
mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
thank
mr.
axelrod
for
correcting
his
misapprehension.
as
to
my
concession,
i
do
concede
that
the
major
involved
imposes
some
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
i
do
not
concede
that
it
is
an
undue
burden
or
an
unreasonable
burden.
on
the
contrary,
we
say
that
the
burden
is
a
reasonable
one
and
is
imposed
in
the
interest
of
safety
upon
the
public
highways
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
not
sure
--
i
--
i
--
i
imaginably
would,
your
honor.
i
did
not
try
the
case
below.
i
took
no
part
in
the
trial
and
i
confined
myself
entirely
to
the
record
only
as
a
deal.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
was
his
position.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no
sir.
it
was
(voice
overlap).
it
was
a
steadfast.
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
answer,
your
honor,
does
put
--
i
have
it
at
page
21
of
the
transcript,
does
put
an
issue
of
factual
allegations
of
the
complaint.
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
it
says
this
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
the
fair
being
of
the
answer
is
that
it
does
put
it
in
issue,
your
honor.
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
page
25
of
the
transcript,
they
say
they
deny
the
allegations
made
in
the
paragraph
25
of
the
complaint
in
a
very
the
same
speculative
contextual
matters
which
are
based
on
an
imaginary
conditions.
and
may
deny
--
they
deny
the
factual
allegations
of
the
complaint.
yes,
i
think
we'll
have
to
say
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
tried
the
case
on
the
principal
theory
that
the
question
of
reasonableness
was
not
lend
for
the
district
court.
and
he
objected
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
i
think
that
was
his
position.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
yes.
i
didn't
say
that
he
said
it
was
--
that
--
that
was
the
only
question.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
was
one
of
his
grounds,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
made
no
serious
attempt
to
repute
the
allegation.
they
did
call
a
witness
who
testified
as
to
how
these
contour
mudguards
can
be
affixed.
and
he
testified
that
they
can
be
either
welded
or
bolted.
and
they
did
call
a
state
policeman
who
said
that
he
had
heard
of
no
accidents
as
a
result
of
contour
mudguards.
and
they
did
put
in
testimony
that
contour
mudguards
tend
to
prevent
debris
from
flying
into
the
face
of
the
following
vehicle
but
they
made
no
serious
attempt
to
meet
the
charges
that
these
mudguards
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
are
inherently
unsafe.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
there
could
be
--
they
--
they
could
--
they
could
have
more
studies
and
more
testimony
from
the
manufacturers
as
to
matters
of
heat
dissipation
and
the
other
factors
come
and
gone.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
i
don't
think
there's
only
--
there's
only
one,
your
honor.
i
know
the
state
didn't
admit
that.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
--
that
is
correct.
that
allegation,
i
mean,
it
is
correct
that
that
allegation
is
made
if
there
is
but
one
type.
the
act
specifies
a
type
of
mudguard
but
the
answer
does
put
an
issue
that
only
one
mudguard,
one
manufacturer
of
mudguard
satisfies
that.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
is
some
testimony.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
did
introduce
evidence
on
that.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
it
on
the
record.
i
don't
know
it
off
the
record.
i
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
try
the
case.
the
assistant
who
did
try
it
is
no
longer
with
the
office.
and
on
this
appeal,
i
have
confined
myself
entirely
to
the
record
(voice
overlap)
before
this
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
like
to
confer
with
the
attorney
general
before
i
made
that
statement.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
--
in
fairness
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
the
court
would
require
me
to
discuss
that
with
the
attorney
general.
i
am
in
charge
of
the
state's
appeals
department
and
not
on
its
trial
department.
and
i
have
known
only
what's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
should
like
to
confer
with
him
at
my
very
earliest
opportunity.
mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
axelrod
has
made
apparent
what
the
situation
is
with
respect
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
text
--
the
diction
that
mr.
axelrod
read
to
your
honors
proclaims
that
commission's
intention
to
leave
intact
state
regulations.
and
we
submit
that
this
regulation
is
a
reasonable
one
so
shown
even
on
the
present
record
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
urged.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
no,
of
course
not.
unless
your
honors
have
some
further
questions
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
say
that
the
evidence
in
this
record
shows
that
the
contour
type
mudguard
required
by
the
illinois
law
although
not
nearly
as
equivalent
as
the
flat-type
mudguard
is
a
superior
mudguard.
there
is
no
reason
that
i
know
of
for
requiring
of
flat
--
a
flat-type
mudguard
and
--
although
the
question
is
not
--
was
not
raised
in
this
record,
i
say
that
the
arkansas
regulation
is
an
unreasonable
regulation
not
because
it
permits
but
because
it
requires
a
flat-type
when
there
is
no
reason
for
requiring.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
require
the
contour-type.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
require
or
permit
it.
i
think
nearly
all
of
them
permit
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
think
that's
what
the
--
that's
what
the
general
assembly
found
and
we
think
the
evidence
justifies
that.
mr.
william
c.
wines
only
as
to
traffic
entering
illinois.
and
these
mudguards
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
we
think
that
the
measure
embodies
a
reasonable
exercise
of
illinois'
police
power
and
we
respectfully
submit
the
judgment
of
the
appeal
probably
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
will.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
attorney
general
is
not
in
illinois
today
but
i
hope
to
be
able
to
get
him
by
a
telephone
tomorrow
or
towards
the
end
of
the
week.
