or
does

state
what
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
--
i
may
--
i
guess
it's
too
much
but
mudflaps
has
been
used
great
many
times.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
learned
that
it
has
to
be
welded.

material?

was
that
his

position?

what
about

answer
put
in
the
issue
the
question
of
reasonableness
and
safety,
the
safe
--
in
order
for
it
be
safe?
i
thought
it
did
maybe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
does
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
put
in
issue
the
factual
allegations
as
to
reasonableness
and
as
to
burden
and
as
to
the
safety.
did
the
complaint
deny
the
allegations
that
it
was
unsafe
and
it
was
unreasonable
and
an
undue
burden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
why
does
he
say
that
was
the
only
--
i
don't
know,
it
maybe,
but
why
does
he
say
that
was
the
only
thing.
i
thought
--
didn't
he
offer
some
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
one
of
his
grounds
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
if
the
record
compel
that
he
said
to
show
that
the
state
did
not
attempt
to
repute
the
allegations
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
kinds
of
attempt
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
other
kind
of
attempt
do
you
now
anticipate
that
could
be
made
other
than
that
they
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
true
that
there's
only
one
manufacturer
here
that
this
is
permitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
alleged
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't
alleged
that
there
was
only
one?
i
thought
i
saw
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
the
state
neither
admitted
nor
denied
that
there
was
only
one,
maybe
identical.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
neither
admitted
nor
denied.
i
thought
that
was
what
he
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
able
to
make
a
statement
to
us
representing
the
attorney
general
that
this
case
has
not
been
--
the
state's
case
has
not
been
added
to
be
presented
and
that
you
can
improve
the
state's
case
with
reference
to
the
findings
that
had
been
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
may
say
if
you
are
the
attorney
general
who
made
that
statement
over
your
signature,
one
member
of
the
court,
i
will
give
a
great
weight
in
connection
with
whether
you
had
--
the
issue
had
been
properly
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
more
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
just
to
see
what
your
position
is.
suppose
it
is
true
that
arkansas
forbid
the
use
of
the
kind
of
mudflap
that
your
state
does,
and
your
state
forbids
the
use
of
the
other
one
and
that
it
is
a
fact
that
arkansas
shipment
coming
up
with
(inaudible)
have
to
make
changes
in
connection
with
the
mudflap
that
would
be
dangerous.
would
you
say
that
was
not
to
be
an
undue
burden
or
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
yours
require?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
axelrod,
i
evidently
made
a
mistake
in
writing
down
the
citation
you
gave,
52
m.
c.
c.
377.
justice
hugo
l.
black
54.
justice
hugo
l.
black
54-377.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
i'm
told
it
was
337.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
