states

justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
if
it's
wrong
for
illinois
to
prescribe

what
concerns
me
is
i
think
you
relied,
don't
you,
on
your
brief
as
i
recall
it
as
you
have,
i
gather
already
in
your
argument
on
what's
been
done
in
25
other
states
as
demonstrating,
am
i

wrong
about
this?
justice

have
done.

justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
suggest
that

you
suggest
that
based
on
the
concession
that
mr.

has
made,
namely,
that
this
is
a
serious
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
is
that
sufficient
for
us
to
affirm
the
lower

now,
where
does
the
burden
lie?

where
does
the
burden
lie?
you
have
to
prove
the
burden
as
the

to
prove
its
reason?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
that
referred
to
in

do
we?

do
you
mind

do
you
mind
giving
it
to
me
again.
i
wasn't

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you
mean
by
that
that
there
was
no
safety
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
as
you
read
that
though,
i
rather
have
the

what
was
an
implication
in
it
that

(voice

safety
hazards
but
they
believe
its
regulations
in
the
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

we're
to
infer
from
that
that
there
was
no
real
safety

investigation
of
it?
justice
william

they
left
holes
in
it.
and
it's
your
point
is
that
they
ought
not

be
allowed
to
amend
it.
