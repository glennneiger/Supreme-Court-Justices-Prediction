mr.
jacob
rassner
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
the
supreme
court.
i'm
indebted
to
this
court
for
the
privilege
of
coming
here
to
present
a
problem
which
has
played
the
merchant
marine
industry
for
many
years
with
the
hope
that
the
expression
by
this
court
may
help
us
meet
some
of
the
problems
which
meet
--
meets
our
--
our
everyday
lives
not
only
those
representing
the
seamen
but
also
representing
the
shipowners
and
the
u.s.
government.
mindfully
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
problem
has
been
presented
to
this
court
some
10
years
ago
in
the
johansen
and
the
mendel
cases.
but
at
that
time,
it
seems
that
a
reading
of
the
cases
and
the
opinions
from
the
district
courts
up
including
this
honorable
nor
these
body's
reports
on
the
various
items
that
were
considered
that
the
problem
was
considered
as
separate,
unilateral
matters
instead
of
taking
the
entire
field,
entire
material,
in
determining
where
are
we
heading
and
are
we
adding
confusion
to
turmoil?
we
must
consider
the
problem
from
its
very
beginning.
the
united
states
government
when
it
first
started
to
operate
vessels
did
so
solely
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
--
an
auxiliary
to
its
defense.
but
it
went
beyond
that
and
went
into
business,
the
same
as
the
man
who
was
selling
dresses
on
the
corner
store.
we
are
now
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
the
government
having
gone
into
the
business
of
merchandizing
or
manufacturing
shall
receive
special
privileges
over
and
beyond
that
accorded
to
the
man
next
door.
if
the
government
opens
the
store
on
one
corner,
does
the
government
get
special
privilege
over
and
beyond
that
of
the
man
who
is
opening
the
same
identical
store
on
the
adjourning
corner?
and
if
this
court
says
yes,
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
if
this
court
says
no,
that
also
was
the
end
of
it
but
at
least
we
are
entitled
to
know
how
this
court
feels
about
it.
the
clarification
acts
of
congress
in
dealing
with
these
problems
have
seemed
to
add
confusion
rather
than
help
us
by
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
certainly
wish
we
could,
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is,
yes,
(inaudible)
which
has
mean
nothing.
but
i'm
answering,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
your
question
directly,
i
wish
you
could.
at
least,
we
get
some
--
some
idea
of
what
is
meant
by
the
words
of
the
english
language
as
used
to
be
so-called.
and
i
use
the
expression
so-called
advisedly
clarification
acts.
now,
where
do
we
start?
with
the
united
states
government
first
went
into
the
business
of
the
merchant
marine
back
in
1916
with
the
shipping
act
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
which
the
emergency
fleet
corporation
was
created
then
we
had
all
the
troubles
that
this
court
was
fully
aware
of
where
our
vessels
were
seized
and
then
we
have
the
flag
case
where
this
court
held
that
an
action
in
rem
would
lie
against
the
vessels
although
the
government
had
not
waived
sovereign
immunity.
then
we
had
the
public
vessels
act,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
followed
by
the
public
vessels
act
which
took
away
the
right
to
libel
the
vessels
in
rem
but
did
create
a
new
light,
that
is
an
action
in
personam
against
the
government.
we
went
from
there
to
various
corporations,
companies,
and
entities
which
were
formed
like
the
mechanical
division
of
the
panama
canal.
then
we
have
the
inland
waterways
corporation,
the
war
shipping
administration,
all
makeshift
means
and
methods
of
meeting
sudden
emergencies.
and
all
of
these
were
created
for
a
temporary
time
to
meet
an
immediate
need
but
never
was
it
intended
that
the
u.s.
government
should
go
into
the
business
permanently
of
being
a
merchant
shipper.as
these
different
entities
were
formed
and
then
changed
from
one
to
the
other,
the
mechanical
division
of
the
panama
canal
was
taken
over
by
the
panama
canal
corporation.
the
inland
waterways
corporation
was
taken
over
by
the
department
of
commerce
in
1939.
the
war
shipping
administration
had
--
was
ended
and
its
functions
were
taken
over
by
the
maritime
commission
for
liquidation
and
the
department
of
commerce.
and
as
--
they
were
changes
from
time
to
time,
we
have
played
their
troubles.
now,
we
didn't
know
--
we
just
don't
know
where
to
go
that's
why
we're
here.
we
want
to
know
what
--
what
are
we
to
do?
now,
if
a
seamen
as
the
u.s.
code
states
any
man
working
on
a
ship
of
the
government
is
a
seaman
except
an
apprentice,
if
a
seaman
is
to
be
judged
by
the
scale
that
his
work
shall
determine
his
rights
then
we're
entitled
to
bring
our
actions
against
the
u.s.
government
regardless
under
what
name
or
in
whose
name
the
shipper
is
operating.
if
the
right
sought
to
be
judged
by
the
title
then
before
i
can
tell
my
perspective
client,
you'll
have
a
cause
of
action,
i
have
to
come
down
to
washington
and
endeavor
the
impossible,
find
out
what
kind
of
cargo
was
carried
on
the
ship.
now
to
me
that
seems
a
little
ridiculous
that
the
right
a
seamen
should
depend
upon
what
is
the
number
five
hold
and
who
knows
what
was
there
after
that
ship
lands
as
a
practical
matter,
nobody.
you
just
can't
find
out
what
was
carried
in
the
number
four
and
number
five
hold
and
what
was
that
cargo?
and
if
that
is
to
determine
the
right
of
the
man
to
a
cause
of
action
then
i
for
one
certainly
don't
see
the
justice
of
it.
this
court
has
expressed
itself
time
and
the
gain
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
practical
proposition.
congress
has
stated
time
and
again
that
it
wants
seamen
to
be
considered,
as
words
of
the
court,
that
they
are
entitled
to
have
any
doubtful
issues
resolved
in
their
favor.
they
have
further
expressed
in
every
act,
that
nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
affect
their
rights,
of
officers,
of
members,
of
the
crew.
now,
we
had
some
question
come
up
on
whether
or
not
the
1949
amendments
of
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
changed
the
rights
of
seamen,
of
course
not.
if
they
had
any
rights
before
they
had
them
after
and
if
they
didn't,
they
don't
have
it
after.
but
that
isn't
the
basis
of
my
being
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
insofar
as
the
--
when
the
inland
waterways
corporation
was
formed,
nothing
was
said
about
anybody
working
for
the
inland
waterways
corporation
or
for
a
subcontractor
or
agent
of
the
corporation
having
any
rights
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
and
the
1949
amendment
was
--
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
include
employees
of
the
inland
waterways
corporation
within
the
benefits
of
that
act,
but
they
said
not
seamen,
not
members
of
the
crew,
indicating
that
legislature
--
with
every
a
statute
says
that.
every
time
congress
spoke
it
said,
“but
not
seamen,
not
members
of
the
crew.”
so
when
--
when
we
have
the
public
vessels
acts
enacted
that
also
gave
us
some
confusion
and
some
concern.
now,
this
court
and
the
american
stevedore
against
porella,
stricken
that
problem
out
and
said,
“well,
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
act
does
not
specifically
say
that
a
seaman
may
--
may
or
may
not
sue.”
nothing
was
said
in
the
public
vessels
act
and
that
time
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
didn't
seem
to
agree
with
our
argument
but
since
then
i
thought
your
expressions
indicate
that
we're
dealing
with
the
practical
problem.
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
you
--
you
have
--
you
have
more
than
pleased
that
man
interested
in
seamen's
right
since
then
by
telling
us
point
blank,
we're
entitled
to
the
practical
proposition
that
confront
us,
not
theoretical.
we
are
not
concern
in
whose
name
the
title
is.
we
are
concerned
in
what
is
the
man
doing.
is
he
working
as
a
seaman,
therefore,
shall
he
be
governed
by
one
standard
and
his
brother
be
governed
by
another
standard?
now,
when
the
clarification
act
was
up
for
consideration
by
the
77th
congress
and
the
general
counsel
to
the
war
shipping
administration
was
asked
for
his
opinion,
he
said
if
i
can
remember
correctly,
i
think
mr.
colby
has
quoted
it
on
page
27
of
his
brief,
“seamen
constantly
interchange
from
time
charted
vessels
to
deported
and
owned
vessels
where
the
personnel
become
employees
of
the
government.
the
rights
of
seamen
may
does
change
from
voyage
to
voyage
dependent
upon
the
particular
status
of
the
vessel
at
the
time
they
sail.”
he
mentioned
the
fact
that
this
created
many
administrative
problems
and
recommended
that
by
reason
of
the
interchanged
ability
of
seamen
and
that
is
his
expression
this
creates
many
administrative
problems.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes,
your
honor.
it's
all
in
here.
it's
all
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
jacob
rassner
no.
one
is
a
--
well,
one
is
a
public
vessel.
that's
the
vallebona.
that
was
a
tank
boat.
mr.
jacob
rassner
--
which
was
owned
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes.
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
i
can
--
i
certainly
can
ask
you
to
revise
yourself
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
--
whether
you'll
do
it
or
not
is
another
story.
mr.
jacob
rassner
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i've
never
hedged.
mr.
jacob
rassner
that's
right.
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
frankly
i
can't
see
the
difference.
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
--
frankly,
i
can't
see
the
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
that's
right.
and
i'm
not
going
to
come
here
and
try
to
get
a
victory
on
a
technicality.
i
don't
see
the
difference
so
i
am
asking
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
precisely.
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
--
and
i'm
not
going
to
try
and
get
a
victory
on
the
technicality
in
which
i
personally
have
no
confidence.
i
don't
see
the
difference
and
i
care
in
what
conscious
argue
that
there
is.
but
i
do
feel
that
people
should
be
judged
but
what
they
are
doing
and
not
by
some
type
and
not
by
what's
in
the
number
five
hold
or
the
number
four
hold
which
you
can
find
out.
mr.
jacob
rassner
whether
the
vessel
is
privately
the
operator,
operators
of
merchant
vessel
by
the
u.s.
government
or
operated
as
a
public
vessel,
let's
say,
carrying
war
supplies
or
soldiers.
and
it
said
that
johansen
and
mendel
decisions
have
left
that
question
open
so
that
if
we
construe
the
decision
in
one
court,
we
may
find
we
are
in
court.
and
we
go
next
door,
to
costa
river
to
jersey,
we
find
a
different
situation.
mr.
jacob
rassner
the
debate
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
no.
it
depends
on
what's
in
the
hold
according
to
these
last
decisions.
mr.
jacob
rassner
oh,
it
depends
on
what
type
of
cargo
the
vessel
is
carrying
whether
it
is
a
public
vessel
so
that
it
may
not
be
subject
to
suit
if
the
johansen
and
mendel
cases
are
affirmed.
mr.
jacob
rassner
or
a
private
seems
to
be
the
question.
mr.
jacob
rassner
it
seems
to
be
that
that
seems
to
be
the
station
left
open
in
the
--
in
those
last
two
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
can't
because
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
can't
see
it.
of
course,
it
was
one
of
my
bases
for
coming
here.
mr.
jacob
rassner
but,
i
can't
go
ahead
and
urge
that.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes.
mr.
jacob
rassner
that's
right.
and
i
don't
see
it
and
i'm
not
going
to
say
i
do.
mr.
jacob
rassner
but
i
do
think
it's
about
time
that
we
went
along
but
didn't
what
the
concept
of
this
court
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
realistic
problem.
are
these
men
who
are
one
day
working
for
the
government
on
a
government
owned
ship
and
many
of
time
they
don't
even
know
who
owns
the
ship.
they
go
to
work.
they
go
aboard
the
ship
and
they're
injured.
his
brother
goes
to
work
on
a
ship
in
the
next
pier.
he
get
--
meets
with
the
same
accident,
he
collects
four
and
five
times
as
much.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
can't
collect
for
pain
and
suffering
under
the
compensation
act.
you
just
don't
get
it.
you
can't
collect
for
your
wages.
you
only
get
a
fraction.
you
can't
collect
for
permanency.
in
other
words,
a
seaman
working
for
one
owner
whether
it's
a
corporation
created
by
the
u.s.
government
and
this
court
has
stated
time
and
again
that
the
corporations
which
are
formed
by
the
government
are
to
be
treated
as
separate
entities
and
also
all
those
emergency
fleet
corporations
cases.
they're
supposed
to
be
treated
as
separate
entities
and
even
there,
the
question
came
up,
are
the
question
of
in
rem
actions
and
this
court
has
held
consistently.
that
was
the
need
for
the
1920
act,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
because
vessels
are
being
seized
and
they
held
that
this
was
a
method
where
the
corporations
were
separate
entities
and
not
the
government,
now
we
are
faced
with
a
different
situation.
in
other
words,
we
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
so
we're
here.
we'd
like
you
gentlemen,
there's
nine
of
you,
tell
us
poor
fellows
what
are
we
up
against?
are
we
suppose
to
find
out
what's
in
the
hold
and
then
come
in
on
a
technicality
as
the
doyle
inland
waterways
case
and
say,
“well,
they
were
carrying
a
general
cargo.”
are
we
to
consider
the
title?
look
up
and
see
who's
got
the
title
before
we
tell
a
man
you
may
have
a
cause
of
action
or
not.
are
we
suppose
to
find
out
whether
the
government
is
operating
under
a
company
formed
by
the
government
or
under
a
situation
where
a
corporation
has
been
formed
by
--
by
the
government?
i'd
like
to
--
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
take
any
more
time
of
the
court.
this
is
a
--
a
rather
difficult
problem.
i've
tried
to
brief
it
as
best
i
could
in
the
brief
and
i've
tried
to
give
us
much
aid
to
the
court
as
i
put
on
my
research.
i
know
i've
fallen
for
short
of
what
would
be
expected.
mr.
colby
has
done
likewise.
i
believe
he
has
added
a
great
deal
of
information
and
knowledge
particularly
in
his
footnotes
to
the
problem
so
that
if
both
briefs
are
considered,
i
believe
the
court
will
get
some
aid
and
some
assistance
as
to
the
problem
that
is
confronting
us.
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
these
remarks
again
thanking
the
court
for
the
privilege
of
being
here,
the
opportunity
to
express
myself.
i've
tried
to
give
it
to
you
as
candidly
as
i
can.
we
are
faced
with
a
difficult
problem
that
seems
to
me
that
justice
in
accordance
with
the
expression
of
congress
requires
that
we
show
that
a
man
as
a
seaman
and
if
he
is
a
seaman
that
he
is
entitled
to
redress
under
the
most
liberal
laws
enacted
by
congress
rather
by
a
very
strict
application
going
back
to
1916
when
we
didn't
have
the
government
operating
ships.
in
other
words,
in
1916,
congress
never
considered
this
problem.
it
didn't
exist.
the
government
did
not
have
ships
that
was
not
in
business
as
a
merchant
marine
operator.
so
that
to
go
back
to
a
time
beyond
when
this
country
was
operating
ships
as
a
merchant
marine
business
and
applied
the
1916
law
to
conditions
which
became
present
later,
i
think
is
carrying
it
a
little
too
far
and
i
believe
that
this
court
in
considering
the
question
should
be
--
should
construe
these
enabling
acts
and
these
remedial
acts
in
a
liberal
manner
the
same
it
was
done
in
the
canadian
aviation
case
and
in
the
american
stevedore
against
porella.
i
want
to
thank
the
court
for
the
indulgence
it
shown
me
and
the
time.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes
sir.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes
sir.
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
was
wondering
if
solely
in
the
interest
of
the
savings
some
work
for
the
court,
if
i
could
point
out
some
of
the
matters
that
mr.
colby
and
i
are
in
accord
and
then
show
where
it
stems
from.
we've
done
it
rather
briefly.
i
thought
perhaps
a
little
more
detail
might
aid
the
court
and
the
court
is
so
disposed,
if
the
court
would
give
me,
say
five
or
10
days.
mr.
jacob
rassner
it
might
be
helpful.
we've
tried
to
cover
it
but
we
--
we
haven't
gone
quite
with
(inaudible)
voluminous
that
perhaps
we
can
agree
on
some
of
the
items.
i
noticed
that
mr.
colby
in
his
brief
has
agreed
with
some
of
my
views
and
i
certainly
agree
with
some
of
his.
in
other
words,
we
are
here
seeking
for
aid,
we're
both
seeking
aid.
so
if
the
court
would
give
me
the
privileges
of
submitting
a
short
five
or
six
page.
mr.
jacob
rassner
thank
you.
may
i
have
five
days
or
10
days?
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
i
thought
i'd
submit
it
in
writing
to
the
court.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes.
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
suppose
i
think
i
could
do
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
--
i
could
probably
do
in
five
or
10
pages
where
it
would
take
me
two
hours.
mr.
jacob
rassner
oh,
i'm
--
i'm
awfully
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
rassner
no,
i
don't
like
to
impose
on
the
court.
mr.
jacob
rassner
we
can't
do
justice
to
as
difficult
a
problem
as
this
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
--
by
just
taking
up
the
time
of
the
court
with
oral
discussion.
i'd
rather
point
out
in
writing
just
where
we
stand
so
we
can
have
the
aid
of
the
court
in
telling
us,
where
do
we
go
from
here?
mr.
jacob
rassner
thank
you.
mr.
jacob
rassner
may
i
have
10
days
on
that?
mr.
jacob
rassner
thank
you
sir.
