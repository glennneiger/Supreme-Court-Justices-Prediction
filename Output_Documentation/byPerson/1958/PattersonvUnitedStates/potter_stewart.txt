justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
that
mr.
rassner,
maybe
i
have
--
perhaps,
i
haven't
quite
completely
followed
your
argument
but
what
--
what's
this
business
of
what's
in
the
number
five
hold
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
depends
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
who's
operating
the
ship,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i
didn't
follow.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
a
public
vessel
or
a
merchant
vessel
--
justice
potter
stewart
--or
a
merchant
vessel
operated
by
the
government
in
both
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
a
distinction
that
you
at
least
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
think
it
has
any
validity
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
distinction
that
the
eight
circuit
saw.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
second
circuit
could
not
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rassner,
just
before
you
sit
down.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
reflecting
your
very
admirable
candor.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
the
johansen
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
understand
then
that
you
and
mr.
rassner
do
not
differ
in
your
reading
of
the
johansen
case,
is
that
your
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'd
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
mean,
to
speak
for
him
of
course
but
--
