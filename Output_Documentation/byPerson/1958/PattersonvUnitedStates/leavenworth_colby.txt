mr.
leavenworth
colby
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
five
cases
involved
five
seamen
employees
of
the
united
states
of
the
particular
kind
of
seamen
employees
of
the
united
states
whom
congress
have
seen
fit
to
leave
within
the
coverage
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
so,
that
all
of
these
men
are
entitled
to
receive
federal
employees
compensation
or
their
widows
in
the
event
of
a
death.
of
the
five
cases,
two
cases,
patterson
and
vallebuona
are
cases
where
compensation
has
been
collected.
the
other
three
cases
are
cases
in
which
no
application
for
compensation
has
been
made
but
the
1949
amendments
provide
that
in
the
event
that
these
cases
are
decided
adversely
to
the
contention
of
the
seamen
that
he
has
a
right
to
sue.
he
can
then
make
his
claim
for
compensation
and
have
this
compensation
claim
considered.
now,
as
mr.
rassner
has
said
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
as
your
honors
know,
this
question
that
we
have
here
before
us
today
is
being
mooted
for
the
fourth
time.
it
is
the
second
time
that
it
has
been
mooted
in
this
court
and
twice
before
it
was
mooted
in
congress.
it
was
before
congress
at
the
time
of
the
clarification
act
of
1943
as
i
recall
mr.
rassner
and
i
both
had
a
small
part
in
that
affair.
it
was
mooted
again
at
the
time
of
the
compensation
amendments
of
1949.
and
this
particular
provision
of
1949
that
saves
the
man's
rights
to
claim
compensation
after
they
have
lost
their
right
to
suit,
if
the
court
decides
against
them,
was
inserted
because
of
a
floor
amendment
in
the
senate
after
the
bill
had
passed
the
house.
the
situation
there
was
this.
the
compensation
act
was
being
revised
and
somewhat
liberalized
and
representatives
of
certain
of
the
seamen's
groups
came
and
wanted
to
have
themselves
excluded
because
congress
was
of
course
unwilling
to
give
them
both
compensation
and
also
to
give
them
the
right
to
suit.
so
some
of
the
seamen
wanted
to
be
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
compensation
act
and
have
just
the
rights
to
sue.
that
is
what
had
been
done
at
the
occasion
of
the
clarification
act
in
1943
with
respect
to
the
war
shipping
administration
seamen
during
the
war.
your
honors
we'll
recall
that
during
the
wartime
operations,
we
had
over
200
thousand
seamen.
we
took
over
that
whole
--
of
the
merchant
marine
and
as
mr.
rassner
says
and
as
it
shows
in
the
brief,
everybody
said
these
fellows
were
going
interchangeably.
now,
that
has
nothing
to
do
of
course
with
this
problem.
that
had
been
disposed
off
by
the
clarification
act
of
1943.
these
men
working
on
commercial
type
vessels
of
the
united
states
had
been
under
that
regime.
they
are
still
under
that
regime
although
they
are
only
a
few
thousand
of
them
now
because
the
maritime
administration
as
successor
to
the
war
shipping
administration
has
very
little.
now,
those
people
had
been
taken
care
of.
they
had
been
assimilated
to
private
seamen.
they
had
been
excluded
by
congress
from
the
benefits
of
the
compensation
act.
when
the
1949
compensation
amendments
came
forward,
the
same
controversy
broke
out,
what
is
to
be
the
seamen's
right?
now,
just
as
in
1943,
the
government
seamen
other
than
those
on
these
commercial
operations
remained
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
so,
in
1949,
congress
took
the
position
that
they
would
not
without
hearings
take
away
the
compensation
right
of
the
large
numbers
of
regular
government
seamen.
and
so
we
had
this
provision
writtedn
into
the
act
to
take
care
of
the
possibility
that
the
regular
government
seamen
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
regular
government
seamen?
well,
it's
a
very
difficult
problem
to
talk
about
government
seamen.
the
regular
government
seamen
i
suppose
in
the
largest
number
are
the
seamen
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
seamen
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
the
seamen
of
the
department
of
the
interior
and
all
these
other
agencies.
remember
if
your
honor
please,
everybody
who
works
aboard
of
vessel
is
a
seaman.
now,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
patrol
boats.
the
coast
and
geodetic
service
has
patrol
boats.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
ferry
boats,
i
think
they
still
do.
they
used
to
have
quite
a
big
one
that
went
out
to
government
--
to
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
ellis
island.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
if
your
honor
please,
they
are
excepted
positions
in
the
civil
service.
in
other
words,
the
regime
for
government
seamen
is
to
assimilate
them
in
pay
in
other
respects
to
private
seamen
but
they
are
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
now,
congress
in
its
wisdom
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
if
your
honor
please,
if
you
mean
by
civil
service
law
benefits,
matters
of
status
and
things
like
that,
no,
but
neither
do
i.
in
other
words,
i'm
in
an
excepted
position
just
the
same
as
the
seaman
is.
i'm
in
a
classified
position
so
that
my
pay
is
regulated
that
way
whereas
the
government
seamen's
pay
is
regulated
according
to
the
pay
scale
of
the
industry.
in
other
words,
every
time
the
nmu
passes
a
contract
with
the
employers
upping
the
wage
for
private
seamen,
the
government
seamen's
wages
go
up
too.
and
these
are
the
numerically
large
crew.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
think
you
can
say
in
general
that
they
don't.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
they
are
in
excepted
positions
just
like
attorneys
are
in
excepted
positions
and
most
of
this
kind
of
thing
doesn't
apply,
some
of
it
does.
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
might
say
i
think
i
--i
have
no
right
to
talk
about
it.
i
think
that
many
of
these
government
seamen
are
subject
to
various
veterans'
preference
and
appeal
rights
of
that
sort,
but
this
is
a
terribly
difficult
question.
this
is
a
matter
which
makes
mr.
rassner's
problem
about
whether
the
seamen
who
has
a
clear
right
to
compensation
might
also
be
able
to
sue
for
negligence.
it
pale's
in
--
in
significance
along
side
of
these
questions
of
civil
service
rights.
but
these
men
are
of
course
in
the
larger
sense,
civil
service
employees,
an
expression
which
means
merely
that
they
are
civilian
employees.
they
are
not
in
the
military
service.
they
are
in
the
civil
end
of
the
business.
now
as
i
say,
this
is
the
big
group.
then
there's
a
large
group
of
those
who
serve
on
the
army
tugs
and
army
barges
at
the
ports
of
embarkation.
now,
these
seamen
are
engaged
in
the
handling
of
cargo
for
the
military
departments.
they
take
it
from
the
railhead
and
they
take
it
over
to
the
army
base
and
they
take
it
over
to
a
vessel
which
may
be
government
or
maybe
private
and
it
goes
ahead.
now,
as
mr.
rassner
says,
if
there's
cargo
that
consist
of
defendant's
property
--
a
dependents'
property
aboard
one
of
those
barges
being
moved
by
a
tugboat
then
the
contention
is
made
at
any
rate
that
--
that
vessel
is
subject
to
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
not
a
subject
to
the
public
vessels
act
because
the
cargo
aboard
is
not
exclusively
governmental
cargo.
there
is
property
of
dependents
and
so
forth.
these
are
--
are
very
difficult
concepts
as
my
brother
says.
now,
if
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
to
be
made
to
depend
on
what
the
cargo
is
aboard,
you
have
no
end
of
difficulty.
in
many
instances
you
don't
know
a
year
or
two
later
when
a
man
tries
to
bring
a
suit,
you
wouldn't
know
what
the
cargo
was
aboard.
on
large
military
types,
the
cargo
manifest
is
probably
confidential.
commonly,
we
admit
that
all
of
these
things
are
employed
as
merchant
vessels
because
we
don't
know
that
it
makes
any
difference
and
you
can't
say
that
it
isn't.
but
these
are
the
controversies
here
that
mr.
rassner
is
talking
about.
and
that
is
why
we
believe
that
the
correct
reading
of
this
court's
opinion
in
johansen
was
that
if
the
vessel
was
a
publically
operated
vessel,
a
public
vessel
in
that
sense
so
that
the
seamen
were
--
of
the
class
who
are
entitled
to
federal
employees'
compensation
then
it
was
their
exclusive
remedy.
that
is
consistent
what
--
with
what
this
court
held
in
the
feres
case
with
respect
to
military
benefits
and
what
has
been
done
about
compensation
for
the
police
by
the
district
of
columbia
court,
a
certiorari
denied
in
louis
and
what
has
been
done
for
post-exchange
employees
of
the
government
in
the
audrey
case,
which
i
believe
is
again
certiorari
denied
from
the
district
of
columbia.
in
other
words,
if
the
man
gets
compensation,
why
then
he
has
no
right
of
suit
but
as
the
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
i
mean
of
course,
if
he
is
entitled
to
claim
it.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
is
he
--
if
he
is
covered
by
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
now,
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
oh,
i
would
hesitate
to
say
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
say
that,
i
mean
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
he
says
yes.
at
any
rate,
let
us
say
this
that
any
attempt
to
distinguish
whether
between
a
publicly
operated
vessel
which
has
a
military
cargo
aboard
and
a
publically
operated
vessel
which
has
some
private
cargo
aboard
is
white
list.
we
had
a
delightful
time
with
mr.
freedman
who
was
a
counsel
for
mendel
in
the
johansen
and
mendel
cases
over
a
--
army
engineer
corps
barge
dredging
the
delaware
river
up
in
philadelphia.
he
contended
that
of
course
dredging
was
a
private
operation.
so
therefore,
the
army
engineer's
dredge
which
was
dredging
the
river
was
engaged
in
a
commercial
function.
it
was
employed
as
a
merchant
vessel.
and
he
introduced
testimony
to
show
that
on
the
same
job,
the
army
engineers
had
to
contract
barges
hired
from
private
contractors
and
they
had
one
of
their
own
with
the
civil
service
crew.
and
he
said
they
are
all
the
same.
the
third
circuit
wouldn't
buy
it.
they
seem
to
think
that
the
question
again
was
if
it
was
publically
operated
probably
it
was
a
public
vessel.
we
refer
in
our
brief
to
the
cases
in
this
court
on
this
doctrine
that
whatever
is
done
for
the
public
is
a
public
vessel.
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
14
here,
the
berizzi
brothers
against
the
pesaro
and
navemar
and
ex
parte
peru
merely
holding
in
line
with
i
guess
its
graves
ex
rel
--
well,
graves
against
the
state
of
new
york
that
when
the
public
does
something
that
it's
a
public
operation.
now,
to
this
extent
apparently
then,
we
are
in
accord
with
mr.
rassner
on
the
question.
now
on
this
question
of
chain
circumstances,
the
only
chain
circumstance
basically
is
that
all
these
type
of
operation
has
declined
the
great
deal.
we
had
200,000
wsa
seamen
who
are
not
under
this
regime
at
all.
that's
cut
down
to
a
few
thousand
now.
we
use
to
have
this
inland
waterways
corporation
which
had
500
seamen
and
it
sold
all
its
vessels
in
1953,
so
it's
out
of
business
and
these
are
the
last
cases.
it's
hays,
sullivan,
and
duncan
here,
they
are
the
last
cases.
there
were
two
others
brought
i
believe
and
we
lost
those
and
we
didn't
take
an
appeal.
in
mr.
rassner's
brief,
it
has
spoken
about
how
much
more
favorable
the
right
of
suit
would
have
been
and
the
recover
--
the
--
where
mr.
cullen
recovered
the
$85,000
in
the
compensation
remedy.
this
is
of
course
rather
amusing
to
me
because
the
bureau
of
employees'
compensation
didn't
want
the
case
appealed
because
they
said
the
value
of
the
man's
compensation
rights
are
around
$175,000.
so
they
were
happy
that
he
should
get
$85,000.
the
significance
of
the
thing
again
is
that
of
course
the
figure
that
appears
in
the
law
reports
was
the
minimum
that
he
was
entitled
to
before
he
made
his
claim.
and
perhaps
i
should
at
this
point
explain
that
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
is
not
the
same
kind
of
a
small
payment
act
that
the
longshoremen's
act
is.
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
has
a
maximum
yearly
payment
of
$7200
a
year.
in
other
words,
that's
as
follows.
if
command
needs
an
attendant,
he
may
be
awarded
$75
a
month
for
that
purpose
and
mr.
cullen
by
the
way
could
have
had
such
an
award
made
to
him.
then,
there
is
the
maximum
compensation
generally
which
is
$6300
a
year
or
$525
a
month
or
a
$125
a
week
if
you
like
to
figure
your
four
and
a
third
weeks
down.
now,
this
is
a
very
different
thing
than
the
prices
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
and
as
mr.
rassner
has
pointed
out,
seamen
are
high
priced
men
but
that
also
works
that
they
are
high
priced
men
from
the
standpoint
of
compensation.
your
honors
must
understand
that
of
the
25
attorneys
on
the
admiralty
staff
of
the
government,
20
approximately
do
not
make
as
much
money
as
a
--
as
the
average
seaman
makes.
so
consequently,
we
have
the
situation
of
seaman
who
make
of
course
nine
to
$12,000
a
year
and
they
are
in
the
upper
brackets
on
this
compensation
business.
now,
my
brother
has
said
in
his
brief
that
it's
a
dreadful
thing
that
the
laws
of
a
---
of
a
arm
is
valued
at
only
312
weeks
compensation.
but
312
weeks
compensation
of
the
$125
a
week
as
i
recall
is
$39,000.
and
remember,
he
hasn't
had
to
pay
any
attorney
at
a
rate
of
25%
to
55%
to
get
it.
so,
we
feel
that
$39,000
for
that
arm
corresponds
almost
to
$75,000
recovered
under
the
jones
act
in
a
private
case.
so,
this
is
not
a
discrimination
unfavorable
to
the
seamen.
it
is
a
discrimination
by
congress.
congress
and
its
wisdom
has
said
certain
seamen
aren't
to
be
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
certain
other
seamen
to
wit
the
war
shipping
administration
seamen,
the
maritime
commission
seamen
are
excluded
from
the
compensation
act
and
are
given
the
same
rights
as
private
seamen
to
sue
the
government
under
the
jones
act
for
unseaworthiness
for
maintenance
and
cure.
now
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
sir.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
sir.
that
arises
in
patterson
because
patterson
--
doody,
the
man
who
was
killed
in
the
patterson
case,
doody
was
an
employee
of
the
mechanical
division
of
the
panama
canal.
in
other
words,
he
was
a
shipyard
man
from
the
--
a
ship
repairman
from
the
panama
canal
company.
and
he
came
aboard
a
war
shipping
administration
vessel
back
1945
and
was
killed
in
the
course
of
his
duties.
he
was
of
course
in
some
sense
a
shore
side
employee.
but
under
section
713
of
title
46
of
the
united
states
code,
everybody
who
works
aboard
a
vessel
is
a
seaman.
so,
if
compensation
had
not
been
missed
to
duties
exclusive
remedy,
he
would
have
been
able
to
sue
the
government
under
the
jones
act
just
like
any
other
seamen
for
negligence.
that
of
course
is
what
this
court
held
in
the
imbrovek
and
haverty
and
uravic
against
jarka,
i
believe
were
the
three
cases.
so
consequently,
the
patterson
case
presented
the
question
of
whether
it
made
any
difference
that
doody,
when
injured
on
the
war
shipping
administration
vessel
in
1945
was
an
employee
of
the
panama
canal
as
opposed
to
an
employee
of
the
war
shipping
administration.
and
of
course
the
answer
is
yes,
as
the
war
shipping
administration
employee
would
have
been
excluded
from
compensation
and
would
have
of
course
had
a
right
to
suit.
being
an
employee
of
the
panama
canal
company,
he
was
entitled
the
compensation
and
was
not
entitled
to
sue.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
don't
think
there's
the
slightest
bit
of
difficulty
mr.
justice.
i
--
i
had
the
greatest
trouble
in
thinking
that
these
fellows
and
the
--
the
regular
government
seamen
have
any
such
difficulty.
a
man
who
goes
to
work
and
he's
hired
through
the
army
base
by
a
bunch
of
fellows
who
wear
those
uniforms
you
know,
he
knows
pretty
well
that
he
is
working
for
the
united
states
and
he
doesn't
confuse
an
army
tug
or
an
army
barge
with
a
private
tug
or
a
private
barge.
and
a
man
who
works
on
a
ferryboat
run
by
the
immigration
service
of
the
department
of
justice,
i
don't
think
that
he
probably
is
in
much
doubt
either.
and
when
you
come
to
the
500
seamen
of
the
inland
waterways
corporation,
i
think
they
were
perhaps
the
least
because
that
corporation
carefully
posted
up
aboard
all
of
its
vessels
scheduled
about
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
how
the
employees
were
under
that
and
that
you're
an
employee
of
the
united
states
and
so
forth.
that
is
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
had
only
five
or
six
cases
involving
the
inland
waterways
seamen
even
though
there
were
500
a
year
of
them
from
1916
or
whenever
it
was
that
iwc
was
organized
down
to
its
sale
of
its
vessels
in
1953.
so
i
--
i
think
that's
greatly
exaggerated.
there
maybe
a
few
seamen
who
don't
know
who
they're
working
for.
but
it
keeps
turning
up
if
your
honors
please.
when
you
sign
your
payroll,
it's
in
there,
thing
at
the
top
about
how
you
take
an
oath
that
you
haven't
supported
the
communist
or
something.
i
don't
know
that
--
there's
all
these
stuffs
sticks
on
it.
the
idea
that
a
man
doesn't
know
he
is
working
for
the
government
is
of
course
quite
inconceivable
to
me
because
the
government
won't
let
you
forget
it.
and
this
is
just
as
true
--
[laughter]
--
this
is
just
as
true
--
this
is
just
as
true
if
you're
a
seaman
as
if
you're
an
attorney.
they
--
things
are
just
not
private
employment.
now,
mr.
rassner
is
perfectly
correct
about
the
war
shipping
administration
of
people
back
there
in
1943
when
we
passed
the
clarification
act.
but
of
course
it's
only
fair
to
give
the
devil
its
due.
one
the
reasons
that
passed
the
clarification
act
and
excluded
the
man
from
compensation
was
they
thought
it
was
cheaper
to
put
them
under
the
jones
act
negligence.
we
cut
that
part
out
in
our
brief
where
the
quotation
appears.
we
--
we
thought
that
was
sort
of
intruding
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well
now,
i
wouldn't
want
you
to
think
that
mr.
justice
because
that's
true
with
this
--
respect
to
this
man
in
this
law
suit.
i
am
not
so
sure
it
is
for
the
future.
that
was
a
transitory
provision
and
it
may
not
go
on
for
the
future.
i
--
i
don't
think
however
that
there
are
probably
any
noticeable
number
of
cases
of
people
who
are
getting
caught.
and
in
addition,
there
is
this
which
probably
renders
all
of
this
academic
ordinarily.
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
authorizes
the
bureau
to
consider
a
claim
within
five
years
even
though
no
notice
of
claim
has
been
given.
now,
of
course,
this
is
a
very
exceptional
case.
as
you
understand
mr.
doody
was
killed
in
1945,
mr.
rassner
brought
this
suit
in
1947,
the
government
answered
1948
and
it
goes
along
like
that.
i
think
the
youngest
of
these
cases
as
you
might
imagine
from
the
fact
that
they
involved
inland
waterways
corporation,
the
injuries
were
in
1951or
1952,
somewhere
along
in
that.
at
any
rate,
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
troublesome
matter.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
right.
they
were
covered.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
will
take
care
of
them.
because
i
think
really
that
there
is
anywhere
near
this
amount
of
confusion
about
a
man
telling
whether
he's
working
for
the
united
states
as
said
--
said.
now,
as
i
say
that
war
shipping
administration
situation
was
quite
different
because
there
were
wartime
secrecy
on
it
and
you
sent
a
man
from
the
hiring
hall
down
to
report
to
a
master
aboard
a
ship,
appears,
something
or
other
and
he
went
down
and
they
put
him
on
and
that
was
that.
he
might
very
well
not
know
who
was
running
the
ship.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
ordinarily,
his
superior
who
of
course
has
to
make
a
report
on
this
on
the
form
ca2
gives
him
a
form
ca1
and
says,
“will
you
fill
this
out
or
shall
i
send
it
in?”
in
other
words,
this
is
the
man's
superior
on
--
on
the
ship
or
if
he
is
in
the
shore
side
manning
pool
and
the
personnel
people
ashore.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
these
are
those
--
those
lovely
governmental
things.
these
are
the
symbols
of
the
bureau
of
employees
compensation
forms.
and
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
we
--
we
have
had
those
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
if
you
--
if
you
wanted
to
--
if
someone
wanted
to
make
a
claim
for
your
burial
expenses,
i
believe
you
are
entitled
to
--
your
estate
is
entitled
--
excuse
me
to
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
$400
dollars
on
application
on
a
form
ca42.
and
i
asked
that
question
if
they
supplied
the
judiciary
because
i
understand
it
does.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
now,
mr.
rassner
has
talked
about
this
test
of
knowing
what
the
man's
employment
is.
seamen
are
not
the
only
group
that
present
that
problem.
we
have
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
the
railroad
workers
which
are
probably
a
larger
group.
we
have
1450
men
working
for
the
alaska
railroad
and
approximately
500
men
working
for
the
panama
railroad.
now,
they're
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
there
has
never
been
any
doubt
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
lower
courts
that
these
people
may
not
sue
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
the
tort
claims
act.
three
or
four
of
them
sue
every
year
but
the
district
courts
usually
have
dismissed
them
without
any
opinion.
but
that's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
thing
if
you're
going
to
try
to
make
the
test
what
the
man
does
as
opposed
to
the
fact
that
he
is
employed
by
the
government.
on
the
same
principle,
i
would
think
that
maybe
some
distinctions
could
be
drawn
with
respect
to
doctors
who
work
for
the
government
and
lawyers
who
work
for
the
government
that
might
not
be
good
but
they
could
be
drawn.
i'm
sorry
not
to
have
presented
a
more
coherent
argument.
i
had
endeavored
to
organize
one
but
perhaps
by
answering
the
questions
as
they
came
along
i
have
been
as
helpful.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
then
thank
you.
