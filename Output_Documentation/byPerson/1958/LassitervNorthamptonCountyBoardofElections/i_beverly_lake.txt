mr.
i.
beverly
lake
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
minute
or
two
remaining
this
afternoon
i
would
like
to
clear
up
some
errors
in
counsel
for
the
appellant's
conception
of
the
north
carolina
law.
there
is
no
permanent
registration
in
north
carolina.
in
the
case
of
clark
against
statesville
which
cited
in
our
brief
i
think
volume
130
north
carolina
decided
in
1905,
nine
years
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
gwen
case,
the
north
carolina
court
had
that
question
before
it
and
said
flatly
that
the
grandfather
clause
did
not
provide
permanent
registration,
that
a
person
who
claimed
the
right
to
register
under
the
grandfather
clause
must
reregister
every
time,
a
re-registration
is
ordered
in
the
state.
now
at
that
time
as
i
say
nine
years
before
the
decision
of
this
court,
in
the
gwen
case
it
was
thought
that
were
two
avenues
to
registration
in
north
carolina;
one
was
by
the
literacy
test,
one
by
the
grandfather
clause.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
no
sir
there
is
not
under
this
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
we
do
not
have
that
in
north
carolina,
no
sir.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
it
is
our
position
now
sir
and
i
of
course
go
into
that
in
detail
tomorrow,
it
is
our
position
that
certainly
since
the
1957
act
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
so
far
as
the
statutory
provision
is
concerned
yes
your
honor.
now
it
is
our
view,
certainly
in
view
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
gwen
case,
that
the
grandfather
clause
was
unconstitutional,
we
are
not
here
undertaking
to
defend
the
grandfather
clause.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
yes
sir.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
we
say
that
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
let
me
put
it
his
way
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
no
one
in
north
carolina
can
do
that
legally.
now
i'm
not
here
saying
that
on
one
in
north
carolina
ever
votes
illegally,
i
can't
say
that,
i'm
sure
that's
not
what
you
mean.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that's
right,
the
law
of
north
carolina
today
is
that
every
person
presenting
himself
for
registration
must
be
able
to
read
and
write
any
section
of
the
constitution
of
north
carolina.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
yes.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that
is
--
that
was
the
date
on
which
the
statute
was
passed
your
honor.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
yes,
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
assume
and
it
has
to
be
an
assumption
i
do
not
know,
i
assume
that
there
has
not
been
in
every
county
in
north
carolina
since
1957
a
general
re-registration,
but
in
every
county
where
there
has
been
a
re-registration
since
1957,
the
literacy
test
applies
to
everybody
and
of
course
in
the
other
counties
where
there
is
a
re-registration
that
would
be
throughout.
i
will
continue
there
tomorrow.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
mr.
chief
justice,
before
getting
in
to
our
prepared
argument,
there
are
two
or
three
other
inaccuracies
in
the
argument
yesterday
by
the
appellant
to
which
i
should
like
to
address
the
attention
of
the
court.
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
counsel
for
the
appellant
made
the
statement
as
i
recall
about
the
doctrine
of
yick
wo
against
hopkins
has
application
to
this
case.
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
federal
court
to
which
appellant
first
went
which
opinion
is
set
forth
and
fold
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
in
the
brief
filed
as
amicus
curiae
by
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina.
the
three-judge
court
said
this
and
this
hearing
was
just
two
months
before
the
application
to
the
northampton
county
board
out
of
which
this
present
appeal
arises.
according
from
the
three-judge
court,
at
the
hearing,
it
was
shown
without
contradiction
that
the
literacy
test
was
applied
by
the
registrar
to
white
persons
and
negroes
alike
without
discrimination
and
the
cross
examination
of
the
three
negro
women
who
were
denied
registration
by
the
registrar,
amply
established
adequate
basis
for
the
denial
if
their
literacy
test
is
valid.
counsel
for
the
appellant
represented
her
in
that
case,
following
that
decision,
the
appellant
under
their
guidance
apparently
returned
to
the
northampton
county
board
and
applied
again
for
registration
under
the
1957
act.
in
this
record
which
consists
of
stipulated
facts,
stipulated
by
counsel
for
the
appellant
who
represented
her
in
the
lower
court
and
before
the
board.
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
suggestion
of
any
unfair
arbitrary
discriminatory
administration
of
the
statute
by
this
board
or
by
any
other
election
board
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
now
of
course
in
this
case,
i
do
not
speak
for
the
entire
state
of
north
carolina,
i
represent
the
county
board
of
northampton
county
which
is
the
defendant
in
this
action.
but
in
this
record,
there
is
no
suggestion
of
arbitrary
administration
of
the
statute
anywhere
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
counsel
for
the
appellant
in
his
argument
yesterday
also
stated
at
least
in
substance,
that
the
negroes
of
north
carolina
are
given
more
difficult
sections
to
read,
more
difficult
sections
of
the
north
carolina
constitution
to
read
than
are
the
white
people.
may
i
refer
to
the
stipulations
which
are
set
forth
beginning
with
the
stipulation
number
9
on
page
8
of
these
records.
there,
it
is
stipulated,
louise
lassiter
declined
and
refused
to
read
the
proper
sections
of
the
said
constitution
or
any
other
section
thereof.
section
--
or
stipulation
15
on
page
9
refers
to
what
happened
when
she
appealed
to
the
county
board
of
election
from
the
registrar.
that
louise
lassiter,
declined
and
refused
to
read
the
said
board's
request
--
refused
the
said
board's
request
and
requirement
that
she
read
the
profit
sections
of
the
constitution
or
any
other
section
thereof.
stipulation
19
that
the
said
louise
--
excuse
me,
stipulation
16,
that
the
said
board
of
elections
upon
louise
lassiter's
failing
and
refusing
to
read
the
proper
sections
of
the
said
constitution
or
any
other
section
thereof.
issued
a
written
order
and
directed
that
she
be
denied
registration.
that
order
is
quoted
in
the
record
at
page
3.
the
official
order
from
which
this
appeal
originates
states
that
the
board
found
as
a
fact,
now
skipping
down
to
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
it
further
being
found
as
a
fact
that
the
said
petitioners
refused
on
june
28,
1957
on
the
de
novo
hearing
before
the
board
of
elections
to
read
any
section
of
the
state
constitution,
she
was
denied
registration.
now
then,
on
page
9
of
the
record
it
is
stipulated
that
the
said
louise
lassiter
because
of
her
lack
of
educational
qualifications
on
june
22,
1957
and
continuously
since
that
said
date
until
the
present
date
is
unable
to
and
has
failed
and
refused
to
write
or
read
or
attempt
to
write
or
read
any
section
of
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
or
any
section
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
english
language.
now,
that
is
the
basis
for
her
denial.
now,
in
appendix
b
of
our
brief,
the
brief
for
the
defendant
board,
i
have
quoted
in
full
article
vi
of
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
obviously
the
purpose
is
not
to
pick
out
a
part
of
the
constitution
which
is
easy
to
read,
that
is
the
part
of
the
constitution
which
if
any,
has
application
to
this
case.
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
the
language
of
that
section,
article
vi
of
the
north
carolina
constitution.i
will
not
read
it
because
it
is
too
long.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
it
is
in
the
appendix
b
to
my
brief
mr.
chief
justice
beginning
on
page
23.
the
entire
article
vi
of
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
is
set
forth
there
in
full.
i
may
recall
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
simply
to
show
the
type
of
material
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
which
this
woman
was
asked
to
read.
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
material.
now,
i
don't
know
sir
that
these
were
the
sections
that
she
was
asked
to
read,
but
these
are
at
least
part
of
the
sections
that
she
could
have
read
under
the
invitation
to
read
any
other
section
of
the
constitution.
this
is
typical
of
the
language
in
the
north
carolina
constitution.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that
is
a
grandfather
clause,
yes,
sir
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
which
i
contend
is
not
the
law
of
north
carolina
this
time,
but
if
i
may
pass
--
differ
that
for
just
a
moment
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
understand
mr.
justice
black
that
to
mean
that
she
stipulates
that
she
does
not
have
educational
qualification
to
read
or
write
any
section
of
the
constitution
of
north
carolina.
now
then,
a
section
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
thrown
in
the
--
i
think
without
any
particular
connection
with
this
case
because
there
is
not
the
test
of
her
eligibility
to
register.
i
can
see
that.
but
have
i
answered
your
question
sir?
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
would
conclude
that,
yes
sir.
may
i
say
sir
that
i
was
not
representing
the
defendant
at
that
time
the
stipulations
were
prepared.
i
have
to
think
that
the
stipulations
are
on
there
on
the
record.
that's
all
that
i
know
about.
but
i
conclude
from
that,
that
this
applicant
is
unable
to
read
and
write
anything
or
approximately
anything.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
in
the
english
language,
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
yes,
sir.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
assume
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
--
i
assume
that
they
are
but
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
--
it's
purely
an
assumption.
i
do
not
know.
i
know
of
general
knowledge
that
it
is
extremely
small.
yes,
sir.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
yes.
i
may
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
in
1900
the
same
time
when
this
grandfather
clause
was
first
put
in
to
the
constitution
of
north
carolina.
it
was
in
1900
under
the
guidance
of
governor
aycock
that
north
carolina
began
a
tremendous
crusade
for
public
education
in
public
schools
in
north
carolina.
and
it
has
been
asserted
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
that
the
literacy
test
was
one
of
the
greatest
booms
to
public
education
that
the
state
ever
had.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
yes,
i'm
sure
of
that.
now,
it
was
suggested
at
least
if
not
stated
that
the
negro
applicants
for
registration
in
north
carolina
maybe
required
to
explain
difficult
sections
of
the
constitution
of
north
carolina.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
any
voter,
any
applicant
for
registration
in
north
carolina
white
or
negro
has
ever
been
asked
to
explain
any
section
of
any
constitution
of
north
carolina.
the
law
does
not
so
state
and
never
has
so
stated
in
north
carolina.
and
if
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
undertakes
to
make
rebuttal
argument,
i
would
like
to
challenge
him
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
any
instance
in
which
that
has
ever
occurred
in
north
carolina.
now,
this
distinguishes
the
north
carolina
statute
from
the
alabama
statute
the
so-called
boswell
amendment,
i
believe,
which
was
held
unconstitutional
in
davis
against
schmidt
because
there
the
statute
did
require
the
applicant
to
explain
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and
i
believe
the
lower
court
held
that
that
was
an
indefinite
standard
and
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal.
now,
i
think
surely,
this
court
will
not
strike
down
a
statute
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
which
on
its
face
is
a
fair
test
of
one's
ability
to
vote
intelligently.
it
will
not
strike
down
such
a
statute
which
the
federal
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina
has
found
to
be
administered
fairly
and
without
discrimination
solely
on
the
basis
of
assertion
by
counsel
outside
the
record
without
the
slightest
bit
of
evidence
to
support
those
assertions.
now,
the
north
carolina
statute
sets
up
a
procedure
for
an
applicant
for
registration
which
i
submit
meets
comfortably
every
possible
requirement
of
procedural
due
process.
may
i
review
it
just
a
moment?
the
first
step
is
that
this
is
a
1957
statute
that
i'm
talking
about
now,
the
statute
under
which
this
appellant
was
denied
registration.
the
first
step
is
that
the
applicant
for
registration
goes
to
the
registrar
of
a
precinct
and
there
establishes
her
qualifications
to
vote
including
her
ability
to
read
and
write.
if
the
registrar
turns
down
the
applicant
for
any
reason
whatsoever,
the
applicant
has
an
absolute
right
of
appeal
to
the
county
board
of
elections.
there,
the
applicant
is
heard
de
novo
promptly,
fairly
and
within
10
days
after
the
hearing,
that
board
is
required
by
statute
not
only
to
make
its
decision
but
to
give
the
applicant
notice
of
its
decision.
if
again
the
applicant
is
dissatisfied,
the
applicant
has
the
absolute
right
of
appeal
to
the
courts
and
i
may
say
if
the
county
board
finds
the
applicant
is
qualified
to
register
then
there
is
no
appeal
on
the
other
side.
but
if
the
applicant
is
denied
registration
by
the
county
board,
the
applicant
has
the
absolute
right
of
appeal
to
the
courts
of
her
state
and
there
again
she
is
heard
de
novo.
in
her
brief,
the
appellant
complains
that
this
is
difficult
because
there
is
a
right
of
trial
by
jury
in
the
superior
court
just
as
it
is
in
any
other
civil
action.
now,
surely,
this
is
the
first
time
that
anyone
has
ever
suggested
to
this
court
that
the
right
to
have
her
case
determined
by
a
jury
of
her
(inaudible)
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
from
the
superior
court
of
north
carolina
she
goes
then
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
but
of
course
going
back
to
the
jury
trial,
this
appellant
wasn't
required
to
go
before
a
jury.
she
waived
the
jury
trial
and
stipulated
the
facts.
her
rights
have
been
determined
by
the
courts
of
north
carolina
on
facts
stipulated
by
her.
now,
the
history
of
the
north
carolina
suffrage
law
and
mr.
chief
justice
i'm
coming
now
to
the
grandfather
clause,
because
i
think
that
is
very
important.
in
1900
the
north
--
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
was
the
one
which
i
shall
refer
to
is
a
constitution
of
1868.
that
constitution
had
no
literacy
test
and
it
had
no
grandfather
clause.
in
1899,
the
legislatures
submitted
an
amendment
to
the
people
of
north
carolina
which
did
two
things.
first,
it
abrogated
the
old
article
vi,
second
it
substituted
a
new
article
vi.
the
new
article
vi
contained
the
literacy
test
and
contained
the
grandfather
clause
of
the
type
later
struck
down
by
this
court
in
gwin
against
the
united
states.
now,
under
that
--
that
of
course
was
adopted.
that
act
of
the
legislation
which
submitted
that
amendment
stated
this
amendment
is
submitted
as
an
entire
indivisible
plan
of
suffrage
and
the
whole
must
stand
or
fall
together.
now
under
that,
the
same
legislature
--
i
believe
the
next
legislature
--
that
is
after
the
amendment
went
into
the
constitution.
the
legislature
then
adopted
what
we
call
general
statutes
16328,
the
predecessor
of
the
statute
from
which
this
case
arise.
that
section
16328
provided
a
literacy
test
but
it
went
further
than
the
present
statute,
it
provided
that
the
applicant
must
establish
her
ability
to
read
and
write
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
registrar.
it
then
contained
the
grandfather
clause
exception.
and
again,
the
legislature,
the
same
legislature
adopted
a
companion
statute,
16332,
which
is
relied
upon
in
the
brief
of
my
opponents.
that
section,
16332,
set
up
the
mechanics
for
registration
under
the
grandfather
clause.
that's
all
that
it
did.
now
then,
we
come
on
to
clark
against
statesville,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
there
held
in
1905
as
i
stated
to
the
court
yesterday
that
the
grandfather
clause
did
not
provide
a
permanent
registration.
it
provided
a
list
of
people
eligible
for
registration.
now,
that
may
sound
like
the
same
thing.
i'm
coming
back
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
the
court
held
in
the
clark
case,
that
every
time
there
is
a
re-registration
of
voters
in
north
carolina,
everybody
must
re-register
grandfather
clause
electors
and
others.
now,
there
were
two
supposedly
that
time,
two
roads
to
registration,
one
was
by
way
of
the
grandfather
clause,
one
was
by
way
of
a
literacy
test.
the
1957
act,
even
if
we
can
assume
that
the
gwin
case
did
not
have
that
effect
because
i
think
it
did.
the
1957
act
closed
forever
the
grandfather
clause
road
to
registration.
so
today,
the
law
of
north
carolina
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
the
constitution
you
mean
your
honor?
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that
is
closed
by
statute.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
barred
by
the
gwin
case.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
not
-–
yes,
your
honor.
not
only
the
law
of
this
court
as
i'm
going
to
point
out
in
a
moment.
i
think
that
is
necessarily
implicit
in
the
very
decision
of
the
north
carolina
court
from
which
this
case
arises
and
i'll
show
you
in
just
a
moment
if
i
may
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
would
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
well,
i
share
that
view,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
it
does
come
to
that
conclusion
in
state
reply.
now
then,
we
come
on
now
to
the
case
from
which
this
appeal
arises.
i'll
pass
over
the
details
of
the
1945
amendment
to
the
north
carolina
constitution
because
those
details
are
inconsequential.
in
the
north
carolina
court,
the
opinion
from
which
this
case
arises
shows
that
the
appellant
there
argue
that
the
1957
statute
violates
the
north
carolina
constitution
for
this
reason;
it
is
a
well
established
rule
in
north
carolina
of
course,
that
the
legislature
cannot
add
to
the
qualifications
for
voting
which
are
prescribed
to
those
prescribed
by
the
state
constitution.
that
has
long
been
the
rule
in
north
carolina.
now,
the
appellants
argued
below
that
the
north
carolina
constitution
of
the
amendment
of
1902
failed,
because
of
the
grandfather
clause.
the
entire
amendment,
being
indivisible,
went
out
the
window
so
we
came
back
to
the
1868
constitution.
since
that
constitution
did
not
have
a
literacy
clause
in
it,
they
contend
that
the
1957
statute
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
legislature.
it
was
in
an
answer
to
that
contention
that
the
north
carolina
court
said
what
it
did
about
the
1945
amendment.
they
say
that
the
1945
amendment,
while
admittedly,
it
did
not
specifically
relate
to
the
grandfather
clause.
the
1945
amendment
undertook
to
readopt
the
entire
article
vi
as
it
then
read
in
the
constitution.
now,
i
too
wish
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
opinion
had
been
stated
in
somewhat
different
terms.
but
the
clear
effect
of
the
opinion
is
that
the
1945
amendment
undertook
to
readopt
the
article
vi
of
the
constitution
and
freed
whether
it
was
already
free
or
not,
we
won't
go
in
to
it,
i
think
it
was,
said
that
in
1945
amendment,
freed
the
general
assembly
to
pass
the
1957
statute,
so
the
1957
statute
is
clearly
the
law
in
north
carolina
today
unless
it
conflicts
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
those
terms
but
i
agree
with
your
conclusion,
your
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
yes,
yes.
i
think
the
that
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
--
that
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
think
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that
is
her
assertion,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
think
that's
clearly
what
she
asserts
but
it
is
contrary
to
the
fact.
it's
contrary
to
the
law
of
north
carolina.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
there
are
no
permanent
registrations
in
north
carolina
under
any
clause,
under
the
decision
of
clark
against
statesville
in
139
north
carolina.
there
just
aren't
any
permanent
registrations
in
north
carolina.
now,
of
course
back
in
the
days
of
long
ago,
there
were
people
registered
under
the
grandfather
clause.
i'm
not
able
to
say,
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
some
of
those
people
now
vote
or
not,
but
if
they
do,
there
is
no
legal
right
in
those
people
to
vote
in
north
carolina.
now,
may
i
just
say
this
with
reference
to
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
court
in
this
case?
counsel
in
her
--
in
their
brief
say
that
the
north
carolina
court
has
never
recognized
the
invalidity
of
the
grandfather
clause
of
course
it
did
in
this
very
case
because
they
could
not
have
sustained
on
the
--
forgetting
united
states
constitution,
they
could
not
have
sustained
the
1957
act
under
the
north
carolina
constitution
unless
the
grandfather
clause
is
a
nullity
because
of
the
very
doctrine
that
she
argued
in
the
north
carolina
court.
that
the
legislature
cannot
add
to
qualifications
imposed
by
the
constitution.
the
constitution
says
--
the
statute
says
everybody
must
be
able
to
read
and
write.
the
constitution
says
grandfather
clause
folks
don't
have
to.
so
the
statute
is
clearly
in
conflict
with
the
constitution
and
the
court
sustained
the
statute.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
that
might
--
i'm
speaking
only
from
recollections.
there
is
no
state
by
law
on
that
except
that
that
can
be
ordered
county
by
county.
i
know
in
my
own
county
for
example
there
have
been
several
in
recent
years.
i
would
say
perhaps
every
three
to
four
years
perhaps.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
my
recollection
is
that
it
is.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
there
are
--
again,
i
--
i
cannot
speak
with
assurance
but
i
believe
that
there
have
been
statewide
re-registration
but
i
can't
answer
that
positively.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
take
it
that
it
is.
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
i
can't
--
mr.
i.
beverly
lake
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
was
not
the
counsel
in
the
federal
court
case.
so,
again,
i'm
speaking
only
from
the
printed
record.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
suppose
that
she
could
but
certainly
she
can
do
this.
she
can
go
any
days,
any
time
she
wants
to.
she
can
go
back
to
the
board
and
apply
again
for
registration
and
start
and
prove
in
the
state
court
such
discrimination.
she
is
not
precluded
forever
from
proving
anything
she
can
prove.
thank
you.
