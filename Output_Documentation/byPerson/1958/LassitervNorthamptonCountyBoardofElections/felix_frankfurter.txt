justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
if
it
wouldn't
interrupt
your
planned
argument,
what
it
is
you
are
complaining
of?
are
you
complaining
that
north
carolina
can't
pass
--
can't
have
a
literacy
test
or
are
you
complaining
or
and
are
you
also
complaining
that
it
operates
the
literacy
tests
against
the
negroes
and
not
against
whites,
is
that
what
you
are
complaining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
that
it
is
actually
enforced
against
negroes
and
not
against
whites
you
don't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
is
--
was
that
a
--
to
most,
not
most
states
but
many
states
and
other
certain
parts
of
the
country,
the
constitutional
provision,
was
that
a
constitutional
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
today
1959,
is
there
a
discriminatory
process
by
virtue
of
your
voter's
legislation
whereby
colored
citizens
are
subjected
to
a
literacy
test
and
white
voters,
any
part,
any
fraction
are
not
subjected
to
a
literacy
test,
statutory,
i'm
not
asking
you
whether
under
the
statute
enforced
in
north
carolina,
by
virtue
of
which
the
exercise
of
a
franchise
has
been
determined,
today
is
there
discrimination
because
of
race
or
color?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
merely
deals
with
future
voters
as
of
what
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
does
that
mean
that
only
after
april
the
8th,
1957
white
voters
must
also
pass
a
literacy
test?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
since
1908
there
has
been
no
discrimination
because
of
color,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
people
were
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
101
years
old,
and
they
become
old
folks
in
north
carolina.
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is
precisely
that
you
are
complaining
of,
whether
that
a
state
can't
impose
a
literacy
test,
whether
it
as
a
practical
thing,
because
of
certain
educational
advantages
or
disadvantages,
colored
people
are
hit
harder
than
white
people
or
whether
as
a
practical
result
or
whether
by
statute
in
the
operation
of
constitutional
statute,
having
nothing
to
do
with
educational
advantages,
white
people
have
immunities
which
colored
people
have
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
gives
you
a
harder
piece
of
reading
or
is
expected
to
read
with
less
flaws
or
things
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
the
statute
requires
it,
but
the
psychological
impact
would
be
such,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
mitchell,
you
are
also
familiar
with
the
case
of
yick
wo,
an
old
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
on
the
face
of
the
statute
it
looks
alright,
but
the
way
the
health
inspectors
actually
enforced
it,
it
worked
all
wrong.
now
it
is
your
claim
that
is
that
kind
of
a
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
well
that
would
require
--
and
you
know
it
that
case,
it
was
established
by
proof,
that
it
operated
discriminatorily,
although
everything
was
fair
on
paper.
now
is
that
your
kind
of
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
in
the
stipulation
of
finding
of
facts,
that
the
finding
of
facts,
in
reading
that,
i
got
the
impression
that
the
preoccupation
of
the
(inaudible)
certainly
was
and
the
literacy
test
as
such
offends
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
out
of
your
memory
or
dictated
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
read,
for
that
you
must
have
the
document
before
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
won't
be
have
to
have
something
--
he
would
have
to
give
you
the
printed
matter
to
the
voter
to
read.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
secondly,
as
to
writing.
is
it
that
he
must
on
his
own
remember
some
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
will
write,
he
dictates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
some
provisions
in
your
constitution
that
it's
more
(inaudible)
--
that
it's
easier
to
take
down
than
others,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
do
they
also
subject
them
under
the
statute
to
an
examination
as
to
what
the
provision
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
my
fault
that
i
didn't
get
complaint
from
your
complaint
or
from
the
fact?
i
didn't
derive
from
it
that
voters
were
cross
examined
as
to
what
some
difficult
provisions
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
no
fault,
but
it's
just
a
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
record
and
what
the
pleadings
present.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
merely
intended
to
indicate
mr.
mitchell
that
if
these
various
operating
discriminations
take
place,
i
for
one
wouldn't
get
it
from
what
appears
in
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
from
the
opinion
of
your
supreme
court
the
registrar
would
feel
entitled
to
cross
examine
perfectly
--
well
this
petitioner,
this
appellant
or
some
very
worthy
citizen;
nice,
good,
honest,
simple,
even
wise
(inaudible)
even
wise
who
aren't
very
good
at
expounding
legal
provisions
and
that
under
the
opinion
of
your
supreme
court,
the
registrar
may
make
life
impossible
for
such
a
person
as
i've
indicated,
am
i
to
get
from
the
opinion
of
your
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
against
--in
favor
of
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
favor
of
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
nobody
in
north
carolina
today
can
vote,
and
by
simply
saying
that
he
was
born
whenever
he
was
born,
and
get
registered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
legally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
any
registrar
either
doesn't
give
the
test
or
disregarded
it,
would
be
violating
his
oath
of
office,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
into
what
purpose
you
invite
our
attention
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lake
just
as
a
matter
--
forgive
me.
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
are
there
reliable
senses
or
other
reliable
statistics
which
show
the
percentage
of
illiteracy
in
north
carolina
both
among
white
and
negroes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
deprive
if
it
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
on
massachusetts
may
have
heard
about
govenor
aycock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

statute
so
far
as
your
statutes
are
–-
directions
go.
and
if
the
grand
–
if
there
is
a
grandfather
clause
in
terms
in
the
statute
and
the
only
way
that's
taken
out
as
you
indicate
by
enforcing
the
gwin
case.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
1957
statute
--
my
comment
on
that
was
that
that
road
is
closed
by
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
it
may
be
opened
tomorrow
so
far
as
your
constitution
is
concerned
but
you
say
it's
barred
again
by
the
gwin
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
only
way
you'll
argue
--
the
only
way
that
the
grandfather
clause
or
the
grandfather
ideas
that
have
any
efficacy,
adverse
--
the
appellant
is
its
state
official
disobey
the
law
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
have
been
a
little
more
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
i
may
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
however
obscurely,
north
carolina
supreme
court
may
have
spoken
it
and
in
fact
gather
from
it
that
the
legislature
has
the
power
that
it
exercised
in
1957
insofar
i
take
it
by
united
states
constitution
is
concerned,
none
of
our
business
whether
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
did
or
didn't
disregard
your
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
it
amounts
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
to
the
question
is,
the
case
in
the
district
court
was
civil
argument,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
go
back,
if
--
if
it
is
alive,
may
they
--
may
the
appellant
in
that
district
court
now
offer
proof
can
be
allowed
to
show
that
in
fact,
although
everything
you
say
is
so,
in
fact,
there
is
the
equal
situation
that
leads
to
this
county
or
that
county,
would
that
be
opened
either
under
the
pleadings
as
they
are
or
with
the
right
to
amend
the
pleadings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
what
you
say
is
sure,
at
least
to
my
view
if
what
you
say
is
so
under
the
law
then
as
a
matter
of
law
the
statute
doesn't
defend
the
federal
constitution
because
it
doesn't
respect
to
make
a
discrimination.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
makes
discrimination
the
result
maybe
the
same
as
far
as
the
appellant
is
concerned.
my
question
is
whether
that
issue
is
open
on
the
return
of
the
state
--
should
it
be
returned
to
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
may
i
ask
a
question?
are
you
saying
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
this
case
as
ruled
or
taken
for
granted
or
recognized
that
the
grandfather
clause
of
the
old
constitution
exists
in
1958
or
1959
(inaudible)
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
appear
from
a
reading
of
that
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
indivisibility
clause
included
that
the
(inaudible)
today
we
would
call
it
a
packet.
the
packet
is
broken
as
i
understood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
indivisibility
clause
has
significance
because
there
was
a
changing
feature,
namely,
the
grandfather
clause
and
this
court
in
gwin
not
only
knock
out
the
grandfather
clause
but
said
if
it's
project
of
an
inclusive
provision
then
the
included
thing
goes
to
the
indivisibility
so
far
as
i
understand
it.
to
knock
that
out
means
to
knock
out
the
thing
whereby
it
would
all
fall
and
i
suppose
that
was
the
response
of
the
gwin
case
to
this
court.
that
might
have
--
