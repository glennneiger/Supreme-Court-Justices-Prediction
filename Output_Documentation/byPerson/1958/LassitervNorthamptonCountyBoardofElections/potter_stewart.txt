quite
apart
though
mr.
lake
from
the
grandfather
clause
or
the
literacy
test
as
far
that
goes,
is
there
any
such
thing
in
your
state
as
permanent
registration?
justice

stewart
for
example,
the
state
where
i
used
to
live
if
you
registered
and
then
voted
frequently
enough
you
never
had
to
reregister;
you
don't
have
anything
such
as
that,
do
you?
justice

mr.
lake
(voice
overlap)
you
made
clear
that
there's
no
permanent
registration
in
north
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
how
frequently
must
the
people
register
in
order
to
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
within
the
discretion
of
the
county
board
of
elections?
justice
potter
stewart
so
a
county
and
the
board
of
elections
could
go
over
20
or
30
years
without
ordering
a
registration?
