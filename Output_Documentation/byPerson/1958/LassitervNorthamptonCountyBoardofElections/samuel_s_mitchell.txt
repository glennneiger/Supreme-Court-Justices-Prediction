mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
case
of
louise
lassiter
versus
northampton
county
board
of
elections.
the
opinion
below
was
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court
of
northampton
county
which
had
in
turn
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
county
board
of
election
which
had
in
turn
affirmed
the
decision
of
registrar
of
the
c-board
precinct
in
denying
to
the
appellant
the
right
to
register
as
a
voter.
now
the
facts
of
this
case
are
found
for
the
most
part
in
the
stipulations
that
counsel
entered
into
in
the
superior
court,
by
which
they
submitted
to
court
the
case
to
the
judge
without
the
intervention
of
the
jury,
for
decision
upon
about
21
findings
of
--
of
21
stipulations
as
to
what
the
facts
were.
the
facts
indicate
that
the
appellant
had
gone
before
the
registrar
of
the
c-board
precinct
on
the
22nd
day
of
june
1957
and
asked
for
registration
as
a
voter.
the
registrar
offered
to
give
the
appellant
a
literacy
test
which
the
registrar
insisted
she
was
required
by
law
to
give
to
all
applicants
for
registration
and
the
appellant
declined
to
take
the
literacy
test
contenting
that
the
literacy
was
unconstitutional
by
the
rights
that
she
had
and
which
(inaudible)
to
her
by
virtue
of
fourteenth,
fifteenth
and
the
seventeenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
from
the
registrar's
denial
on
22nd
day
of
june
1957
to
appellant
of
the
right
to
register,
the
appellant
took
the
appeal
provided
by
the
statute
which
is
north
carolina
general
statute
163-28
to
the
board
of
elections.
board
of
elections
heard
the
appellant's
appeal
on
the
28th
day
of
june
1957
and
also
declined
to
register
the
appellant
upon
her
failure
to
submit
to
the
literacy
test
or
at
least
to
the
educational
test
provided
by
the
statute.
from
the
decision
of
the
board
of
elections
the
appellant
found
herself
in
the
superior
court
where,
as
i
have
stated
for
the
--
all
of
the
facts
boil
down
in
21,
stipulations
in
which
counsel
entered
into,
which
are
found
in
record
here
as
to
what
the
facts
of
the
case
were.
now
the
--
prior
to
this
proceeding
which
began
with
the
registrar
in
the
c-board
precinct
in
june,
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
a
trial
by
a
three-judge
district
--
united
states
district
court
and
which
opinion
is
reproduced
i
believe
in
the
brief
here
of
the
--
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
attorney
general
and
which
it
referred
to
in
all
of
the
briefs
before
the
court.
that
case
is
called
lassiter
versus
taylor.
in
that
case
the
court
had
ruled
that
where
the
appellant
who
is
the
same
appellant
before
this
court,
had
said
that
and
had
claimed
that
the
constitutional
provisions
of
north
carolina
provided
for
the
educational
test
and
statutes
provided
by
the
educational
test
were
offensive
to
the
rights
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
that
the
section
of
the
constitution
involve
which
is
section
6
--
section
4
of
article
6
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
unconstitutional
when
written,
when
enacted,
and
of
course
it
was
enacted
in
1902.
now
the
court
provided
in
that
judgment
that
it
was
stayed
in
a
further
investigation
as
to
the
matter
or
any
further
inquiry
into
the
case
until
plaintiff
had
gone
into
the
state
court
to
get
an
interpretation
upon
some
new
state
laws
that
had
been
written
while
that
action
was
pending.
one
week
before
the
district
court
sought
to
rule
upon
the
matters
which
plaintiff
had
placed
--
initiated
in
the
district
court
pertaining
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
literacy
test
and
the
applicability
of
the
same
to
her,
the
general
assembly
of
north
carolina
had
rewritten
the
statutes
involved
doing
nothing
to
the
constitution
provision
but
had
rewritten
the
statutes
in
which
they
had
taken
out
certain
language
in
statutes
such
as
that
an
applicant
for
registration
would
have
to
satisfy
the
registrar
as
to
his
quantification,
they
had
put
in
certain
appeal
mechanism
and
had
provided
that
from
the
registrar's
decision
there
would
be
appeals
to
the
board
and
also
the
superior
court
of
the
county.
it
was
--
these
administrative
remedies
that
the
federal
court
referred
to
when
it
said
that
it
was
stay
execution
or
it
would
stay
further
proceeding
in
the
case
of
lassiter
versus
taylor
until
the
plaintiff
had
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
provided
under
north
carolina
general
statute
163-28
as
revised
and
as
rewritten
just
seven
or
eight
days
prior
to
the
convenience
of
the
court
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that
is
the
end
of
that
opinion.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
the
older
part
of
the
opinion.
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that
that's
the
way
that
order
reads
of
course
in
staying
that
--
under
that
order
the
court
cited
the
case
of
cio
versus
windsor,
the
case
of
cio
versus
windsor
at
353
united
states
364
in
which
a
similar
state
had
been
entered.
there
the
court
had
stayed
its
jurisdiction
in
order
to
allow
the
appellant
to
going
into
the
state
court
to
get
an
interpretation
of
the
state
law
under
the
state
constitution.
the
appellant
in
going
into
state
court
to
get
that
interpretation,
only
got
the
law
interpreted
as
the
state
constitutional
(inaudible)
without
presenting
to
his
state
court
the
federal
issues
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
raising.
and
when
--
he
then
returned
to
the
federal
court
after
having
submitted
his
state
issues,
and
his
state
issues
only
to
the
state
court,
while
the
court
so
held
that
he
should
have
presented
the
entire
matter
to
the
state
court
and
that
the
state
court
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
not
only
pass
on
the
state
issues,
but
also
on
the
federal
issues.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
now
we
didn't
do
that
your
honor.
what
we
did
is
to
present
the
entire
case
to
the
state
tribunal
and
then
from
the
state
tribunal's
decision
we
brought
the
appeal
here.
this
appeal
here
is
taken
directly
from
the
opinion
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court's
decision
which
was
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
right.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
we
may
have
misinterpreted
cio
versus
windsor,
but
our
understanding
was
that
what
this
court
was
asking
action
is
that
you
give
your
state
court
a
full
opportunity
to
pass
upon
your
state
--
upon
all
of
your
issues,
both
state
issues
and
federal
issues.
that
under
the
doctrine
of
the
--
that
the
court
is
now
pursuing
of
abstaining
from
interfering
with
the
state
tribunes
and
their
handling
of
cases,
that
the
court
wanted
the
state
court
to
fully
exhaust
all
of
the
possibilities
in
the
case,
federal
and
state
before
the
federal
tribune
should
intervene.
now
following
that
through
and
taken
what
we
thought
to
be
the
dictate
in
the
cio
case
there,
we
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
it
is
from
that
opinion
that
the
appeal
here
is
taken.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that
and
the
cio
--
after
this
cio
versus
windsor
we
weren't
sure
of
what
to
do
there.
actually
we
wondered
if
we
hadn't
noted
and
asked
this
court
for
a
review,
then
exactly
where
our
case
would
be.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
what
did
you
say?
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
exactly
what
we
felt,
because
both
of
those
cases
we
have
read
them
over
and
over
and
we
still
don't
get
too
far
with
it.
now
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
i
think
it,
as
far
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
concerned,
the
argument
that
the
appellant
makes
is
this,
that
the
north
carolina
constitution
provisions
which
have
to
do
with
the
--
and
which
require
the
educational
test
in
1902
when
it
was
passed
provided
that
all
people
would
take
--
would
submit
to
that
test
except
those
people
who
either
voted
in
1868
or
whose
lineal
decedents
voted
in
1860.
i
believe
the
exact
text
of
that
constitutional
provision
is
found
on
page
seven
to
page
eight
of
our
brief.
now
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
well
our
contention
is
more
or
less
a
combination
of
both
and
yet
not
quite
in
the
fashion
in
which
it
has
been
stated.
we
are
contending
this
firstly,
that
the
educational
test
for
voters
is
a
heavier
burden
on
the
negroes
in
north
carolina
than
upon
the
white.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
no,
but
here
is
what
they
did.
they
devised
a
scheme
by
which
in
1902,
from
1902
to
1908
the
idea
was
that
all
negroes
would
be
subjected
to
literacy
tests
and
no
whites.
beginning
--
after
1908
a
few
whites
or
at
least
those
whites
who
would
register
after
1908
according
to
the
wording
of
the
statute,
along
with
all
the
negroes
would
continue
--
would
have
to
submit
to
literacy
test,
it
was
a
process
of
then
diluting
the
discrimination,
and
we
start
in
1902
to
1908
with
total
discrimination.
beginning
with
1908
we
dilute
that
discrimination
and
we
just
keep
right
on
diluting
it
and
i
suppose
the
plan
would
be
as
one
day
that
everybody
would
be
equal
after
years
of
tests
for
all
of
the
people
who
had
originally
qualified
for
their
franchise
under
the
grandfather
clause
had
passed
on.
but
now
we
are
saying
this,
two-folds,
number
one
that
the
very
process
of
setting
--
that
was
set
up,
set
in
motion
in
1902
and
that
is
still
effective
today
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that
was
a
constitutional
provision.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
well
we
have
to
yes
to
that
when
you
say
in
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
for
this
reason.
although
the
statute
provides
that
everyone
who
becomes
a
voter
today
would
have
to
come
in
through
this
educational
test,
we
still
have
the
process
of
giving
the
franchise
to
people
who
were
quiet
between
1902
and
1908
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
the
statutes
--
the
new
statute
that
we
have
was
enacted
in
april
the
12th,
1957.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
no,
i
qualify
that
by
saying
this;
that,
that
the
statute
which
was
enacted
to
implement
the
constitutional
provision
in
1902
which
took
effect
then,
provided
that
everybody
would
take
the
educational
test
beginning
in
--
after
december
1908.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
well
your
honor
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
there
was,
if
that
were
the
case.
what
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
by
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
well
now,
i
want
to
say
this
that
we
strenuously
urge
that
the
mere
presence
in
the
statute
and
in
the
constitution
are
these
provisions
by
which
we
constantly
make
reference
to
what
was
prior
to
1860,
tends
to
place
a
heavier
burden
on
the
negro
resident,
of
the
negro
applicant
for
the
vote,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
registrar
and
i
think
its
only
natural
would
see
to
it
that
since
he
is
of
that
group,
that
they
had
such
stigma
against
and
that
they
suspected
in
1902
that
he
undergo
a
more
rigorous
examination.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
the
purpose,
we
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
we
insist
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
now
that
is
another
instance
in
which
we
think
the
discrimination
went
above.
you
have
permanent
registration
only
of
people
who
registered
between
1902
and
1908.
you
can
have
new
registrations
as
often
as
a
county
board
of
elections
or
the
state
board
of
elections
will
call
for.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
they
call
for
it
often,
i
wouldn't
say
exact
--
it
can
vary
according
to
county.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
so
once
you
have
registered
and
you
qualified
under
the
education
test
that
does
not
mean
that
you
won't
ever
have
to
do
it
again.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
who
qualified
under
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
right,
in
other
words
they
must
take
the
test,
they
must
again
be
examined.
now
and
that's
true
also
for
people
who
move
about
from
one
county
to
another
county.
people
who
are
permanently
registered
and
moving
about,
they
undergo
no
inconvenience
because
they
can
call
upon
their
permanent
registration.
for
those
people
who
came
in
under
the
educational
test,
when
they
move
from
place
to
place,
there
is
no
provision
in
statute
and
whatsoever
that
they
can
move
without
registration
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
we
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
we
have
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
how
and
what
incident
of
operation
the
statute
is.
now
in
that
aspect,
the
two
cases,
well
we
are
not
like
yick
wo
because
i
quite
agree
that
in
that
case
they
did
go
to,
look
at
all
of
the
laundries
that
they
had
there
in
that
area
to
show
that
the
chinese
laundries
were
never
allowed
to
be
in
wooden
frame
buildings,
whereas
the
other
laundries
were
from
time
to
time.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
no
he
asked
me
would
i
--
i
thought
he
asked
me
would
i
say
that
you
would
have
discrimination
here
as
you
had
it
in
the
yick
wo
case,
i've
added
that
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
we
don't
have
that
case
as
such
here.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
we
are
presenting
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
under
stipulations
that
we
that
we
entered
into
in
the
trial
court
which
included
in
the
opinion
that
the
state
supreme
court
issued
in
that.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
we
have
made
that
argument
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
our
argument
too
in
our
brief.
now
it
wasn't
so
particular
with
--
it
wasn't
so
particular
that
a
literacy
test
as
such,
but
the
type
of
test
we
have
here.
now
the
north
carolina
constitution
requires
that
you
be
able
to
read
and
write
in
a
section
of
the
state
constitution.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
it
says
that
you
be
able
to
read,
well
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
read
and
write
in
a
section,
now
of
course
the
practice
in
there
is
simply
this
in
that
there
is
no
way
in
order
--
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
tells
a
registrar
what
kind
of
test
he
is
supposed
to
give.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
to
read.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
well
i'm
assuming
that
it
means
that
registrar
will
read
and
you
will
write,
what
he
reads.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
the
assumption,
however
that's
an
assumption
and
due
to
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing,
there
are
no
standards
in
the
statute
whatsoever
to
tell
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
true,
that's
true
and
we
certainly
think
this
too,
that
you've
got
words
in
the
state
constitution
that
only
lawyers
would
know
anything
about
and
some
of
them
come
--
lawyers
don't
know
too
much
about.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
the
practice
is
that
because
of
this
registrars
will
insist
that
if
you
--
that
you
tell
--
that
you
be
able
to
give
a
meaning,
especially
where
there
is
a
word
mispronounced,
or
where
there
is
a
word
misspelled
when
you're
writing
from
the
dictation.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
well
they
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that
maybe
our
fortune.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
yeah,
well
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
the
pleading,
in
this
the
--
there
were
no
pleadings
in
this
case.
this
was
a
case
that
was
brought
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
the
district
court,
that
we
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies
in
the
state.
administrative
remedy
in
the
state
which
is
found
in
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
the
filing
of
any
papers
and
of
course
none
were
filed,
because
we
went
through
the
remedy
as
it
was
written.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
on
the
other
hand
we
say
this
that
because
of
the
looseness
and
the
vague
language
that's
used
in
the
statute,
that
and
especially
in
a
case
that
had
been
interpreted
before
by
the
state
supreme
court
twice,
it
has
been
before
the
state
supreme
court
twice
on
the
same
statute
that,
that
alone
as
we
see
it
does
place
an
applicant
for
the
franchise
at
undue
disadvantage.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
what
we
think
it
is,
of
course
this,
we
don't
think
the
statute
provides
that
you
are
not
going
to
register
unless
you
take
the
test,
and
that
the
statute
provides
that
the
registrar
must
give
it.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
the
statute
doesn't
require
any
interpretation
your
honor
but
he
has
been
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
ever
done.
i
merely
went
outside
of
the
record
i
suppose
in
answering
this
question,
but
that's
certainly
is
the
situation.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
have
about
two
minutes
and
at
that
time
i
just
want
to
make
reference
to
two
things
that
seem
to
be
getting
in
our
way
here.
number
one
is
this,
the
counsel
for
appellee
says
that
the
permanent
registration
situation
doesn't
exist
in
north
carolina
be
just
that
he
said
as
of
1957.
now,
we
want
to
point
out
this
that
the
statutes
that
set
up
the
permanent
registration
of
the
exemptions
in
1900
where
general
statutes
163
section
32
and
sections
that
follow
section
32.
in
revising
and
in
rewriting
the
registration
statute
in
1957,
the
journalist
seemed
only
purported
to
rewrite
section
28
which
only
dealt
with
the
literacy
test.
they
did
not
purport
to
repeal
the
section
32
and
the
section
that
followed
that.
they
did
not
attempt
to
rewrite
those
sections.
they
left
those
sections
fully
intact.
also,
the
court
in
its
opinion
below
in
passing
the
appellant's
case
made
no
allusion
whatsoever
to
the
fact
or
to
this
any
supposition
that
permanent
registration
is
unconstitutional
and
can
be.
in
a
prior
decision
in
1936,
all
the
court
said,
all
our
state
supreme
court
said
was,
that
we
all
not
to
worry
about
that
because
the
time
for
registering
under
those
statutes
has
left
so
we
have
to
wait
for
this
situation.
in
the
revival
that
the
court
made
of
the
--
of
the
constitution
provision,
in
the
opinion
below,
what
the
court
did
was
to
revive
the
whole
business,
grandfather
clause
and
all
and
appellate
admits
that
in
his
brief.
they
revived
the
entire
business
except
the
indivisibility
clause.
now,
we
say
that
this
business
of
the
repeal
can
be
inferred
because
of
other
decisions
in
our
court
which
say
that
a
general
--
such
as
the
repeal
of
section
28
which
dealt
with
the
literacy
test.
there
was
a
general
repeal
there
which
says
that
all
laws
inconsistent
would
be
repealed
but
now
in
state
--
our
court
says
that
that
clause
does
not
repeal
other
sections
unless
it
is
just
uninterpretable
that
the
two
sections
could
stand
and
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
we
are
saying
that
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that
will
appear
from
the
reading
of
the
opinion.
from
the
reading
of
the
opinion
what
they
said
that
the
whole
business,
all
of
article
vi
of
the
state
constitution
came
forward
with
the
exception
of
the
indivisibility
clause
that
was
put
in
--
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
that's
--
the
thing
about
it
was
in
1902
they
said
that
if
anything
about
the
whole
plan
is
unconstitutional
then
the
whole
plan
would
fall.
there
will
be
no
amendment.
but
now
in
this
revival,
in
the
court
below,
what
they
did,
they
said
that
they
merely
took
recognize
--
they
merely
took
out
the
indivisibility
clause
in
that
state.
mr.
samuel
s.
mitchell
i
see.
well,
the
indivisibility
clause
in
the
north
carolina
constitution,
merely
have
reference
to
all
the
provisions
in
that
plan.
now
all
they
said
in
the
opinion
below
is
that
the
whole
plan
came
forth
and
the
indivisibility
clause
was
no
longer
necessary.
