i'm
puzzled
by
the
--
some
statements
of
fact
on
page
26
of
the
appellants
brief
which
seem
to
indicate
to
mean
that
the
existence
of
this
grandfather
clause
which
is
preferential
in
operation
to
the
white
people
has
projected
itself

you

i'm
a
little
confused
on
that.
there
are
no
permanent
registrations
under
the
grandfather
clause?
