your
--
the
immunity
which
you
urged
is
the
immunity
of
the
person
and
not
of
the
enclave
of
the
--
of
the
navajo
reservation,
is
that
right?
they
both
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
meant
immunity
on
the
enclave
as
to
navajo
indian.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
your
claim
is
broader
than
--
your
claim
is
the
immunity
of
the
navajos
on
or
off
the
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it's
a
sort
of
a
territorial
immunity
of
the
navajos
within
the
reservation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
if
the
navajo
indian
was
off
the
reservation
or
off
the
town
or
--
so
on
then
he's
--
then
he
maybe
personally
served?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
--
maybe
personally
served,
that
isn't
this
case
now.
maybe
personally
served
off
the
reservation
on
a
transaction
that's
within
the
reservation,
localized
within
the
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
it
isn't
merely
the
geography
but
it's
also
the
immunity
of
the
indians
with
reference
to
transactions
pertaining
to
the
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
indian
law
is
full
of
inferences
where
advantage
is
given
to
indian
and
immunity
is
also
given
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
what
the
practice
or
what
practice
you
offer
that
over
a
period
in
which
you
have
not
indicated,
suits
have
actually
been
brought
by
traders
in
tribal
courts
which
you'd
have
to
be
dismissed
neither
as
the
questions
were
raised
by
the
defendant
or
sua
sponte
by
the
tribal
courts,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
over
what
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
over
what
period?
these
--
these
are
nisi
prius
cases,
all
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i'm
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
question
is,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
it
as
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
know
things
about
this
--
you
spoke.
i'm
trying
to
elicit
the
scope
of
the
offer
and
its
significance.
now,
over
what
period
are
these
cases
--
these
cases
exist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
now
pending
at
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
in
fact
as
they
are
contemporaneous
or
--
or
recent
cases
is
a
two-edge
in
and
its
implication,
namely,
lawyers
are
sometimes
wrong
about
their
notion
of
logistic
law.
i've
known
lawyers
to
be
wrong
as
indeed
you
have
those.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
well,
they
are
not
unique,
i
can
assure
you,
even
if
we
do
it
among
lawyers
and
judges.
have
you
furnished
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
--
list
of
these
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
an
opportunity
to
make
any
response
in
your
--
to
the
argument
of
--
of
practical
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
says
in
--
and
the
indians
(inaudible)
into
the
bureau?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
solicitor
general
has
coupled
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
the
indian
tribe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
--
that
that
should
carry
great
weight
among
others
in
a
field
that's
specialized
in
the
--
you
say
as
indian
law,
doesn't
have
the
interior
department
say,
“this
is
our
view,
presumably,
means
the
study
of
the
intricate
variety
of
indian
legislation,
regulation
and
practice.”
that
doesn't
preclude
you're
being
wholly
right.
i'm
merely
suggesting
what
it
is
that
one
has
to
overcome.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
more
--
one
more
thing
that
maybe
urged
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
namely,
that
it's
protective
of
the
indians
but
would
--
one
would
--
beyond
the
alertness
the
indian
office
under
some
unfriendly
administration
and
that
does
--
i
mean
of
indian
affairs
would
take
the
position
against
the
indians.
but
this
is
protective
of
this,
isn't
it,
at
least
to
a
measure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
is
it?
to
that
extend,
it's
protected,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
we'll
--
perhaps
we'll
appreciate
your
argument,
at
least
i
would
more,
after
you've
given
us
this
network
of
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
he
has
withheld
all
views
on
the
larger
issue
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
he
was
righteous,
if
i
may
say
so,
he's
right
about
the
regulation
to
my
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
strength,
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what
--
for
what
district
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
outside
of
the
reservation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
a
navajo
indian
can
run
for
office
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
who
presented
community
outside
of
the
reservation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
really?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stevenson,
the
--
these
changes
haven't
affected
the
broad
constitutional
relation
being
the
federal
government
and
the
states
vis-à-vis
indians,
that's
it.
i
mean
--
worcester
against
georgia
is
still
citable
and
still
as
it
were
the
foundation
of
any
consideration
of
power.
i'm
not
now
talking
about
recognition,
conscious
recognition
to
legislation
whether
explicit
or
implied
by
congress
and
supply
the
constitutional
relationship
between
the
indians
as
--
as
it
were
a
people
of
--
of
the
denominated
and
aide
of
foreign
people
within
the
united
states
leaving
the
control
that
congress
chooses
to
exercise
it
and
to
the
extent
where
it
does
choose
wholly
within
the
federal
authority.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pass
changes
in
--
in
the
actual
recession
from
that
abstract
political
legal
position
but
no
change
in
the
constitutional
framework.
justice
felix
frankfurter
clear
me
up
--
clear
me
up
a
little
bit,
mr.
stevenson.
you
trouble
me,
and
you
now
made
it
firm.
you
said
congress
could
oust,
that
implies
that
it
is
in
but
maybe
supplanted
rather
than
--
that
it
isn't
in
but
may
have
a
grant
given
to
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
--
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
care
about
the
verdict
particular.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
took
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
the
line
of
argument
that
you
are
going
to
enfold
it
is
that
arizona,
a
particular
situation
by
virtue
of
the
treaty
with
the
indians,
by
virtue
of
the
terms
of
admission,
by
virtue
of
the
legislation
pertaining
to
arizona,
you
don't
care
about
the
other
47
states
at
this
--
at
the
moment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
arizona
or
this
body
of
treaty,
constitutional
provisions,
legislation,
congressional
response
thereto
let,
didn't
require
a
grant
from
the
congress
but
put
in
to
arizona
power
which
congress
could
took
away
--
they
could
take
away
but
in
--
in
--
for
lack
of
withdraw,
it
is
there.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
you're
going
to
develop
that
with
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly,
all
right.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
that's
it,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
tribal
courts
(inaudible)
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
strengthen
this
--
perhaps
to
diverting
line
of
inquiry
what
--
on
the
basis
of
what
law
do
--
the
federal
courts
grant
divorce?
arizona
state
law?
what
are
your
grounds
for
divorce
in
arizona?
justice
felix

bare
law,
indian
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
customs.
now
--
and
your
--
the
state
courts
of
--
of
arizona
respect
on
a
full
faith
and
credit
clause
under
the
theory,
the
tribal
law
or
decree.
now,
did
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
navajo
husband
and
the
navajo
wife
can
go
into
the
state
court
and
get
a
divorce
which
must
be
based
on
some
allowable
grounds
for
divorce
of
arizona
law
which
maybe
in
conflict
with
the
tribal
law
of
divorce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
problem
here
but
this
opens
up
interesting
possibility
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
the
law
and
state
law.
they've
done
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet,
you
--
yet,
if
mr.
littell's
argument
prevails
assuming
it's
applicable
to
the
divorce
situation
which
has
authored
its
own
quiddities
and
oddities
of
law,
you
could
--
hereafter,
the
wife
could
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
(inaudible)
that
husband
to
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
for
divorse
--
therefore
divorce
in
court
and
a
state
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
to
discriminate
between
divorce
jurisdiction
and
non-divorce
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
if
he
contested
her
on
mr.
littell's
ground,
he
could
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
the
proceeding
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
is
that
right?
unless
he
tells
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
there
maybe
a
--
there
maybe
a
good
deal
of
so-called
practice
that
hasn't
been
challenged,
but
one
way
or
other,
either
lawyers
or
litigant
could
always
raise
the
questions
as
long
as
there's
pertinence
on
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
insidious
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
case
of
a
civil
and
crimes
act,
you
--
you
haven't
got
any
--
it's
a
rare
case
that
you
got
a
federal
penalty
for
the
commission
of
state
offense,
isn't
it?
justice
felix

would
--
would
you
spread
that
delicate

justice

would
you
mind
giving
it
again?
