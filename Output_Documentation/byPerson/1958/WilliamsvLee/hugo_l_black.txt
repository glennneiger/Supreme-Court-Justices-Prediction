justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
tribal
courts
that
--
of
that
idea
--
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sorry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
pretty
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
interrupt
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this.
you
said
you'd
give
us
a
list
of
cases
tried
in
the
tribal
courts
on
the
basis
that
there
is
a
--
a
place
where
these
rights
can
be
enforced
to
this
contract.
of
course,
that
would
not
be
true
unless
there
was
power
to
establish
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
power
to
establish
the
tribal
court.
in
reading
the
case
from
arizona,
the
regional
case,
begay,
i
see
that
they
recognized
tribal
courts
in
connection
with
domestic
relation
and
thought
they
had
found
a
federal
basis
of
authority
on
which
to
rest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
--
where?
that's
the
tribal
court
thought
domestic
relation.
what
--
where
do
you
find
the
source
of
the
establishment
of
these
tribal
courts
which
would
exclude
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
in
these
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
specific
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
that's
not
the
one
that
says
that
they
do
business
at
their
risk.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
courts
for
what?
indian
offences.
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
are
the
regulations
that
you
have
cited
in
your
brief
which
show
that
they
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
of
cases
like
this
which
are
authorize
by
regulation
which
themselves
are
authorized
by
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
their
judgment
final
under
the
--
the
judgment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
tribal
court
final?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
congress
has
full
power
to
do
so
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
fixed
to
these
courts
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
purpose
of
having
that
judgment
final
and
that
chose
to
do
business
with
the
indians?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
to
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you'd
have
to
look,
would
you
not,
even
to
a
statute
or
treaty
rather
than
the
constitution
insofar
as
that
power
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
promulgate
regulations
that
have
the
effect
of
law?
could
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
you
just
look
to
the
constitution
and
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
do
that
without
authority
of
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
answer
is
yes,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
that
would
be
a
power
delegated
by
congress?
so
that's
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
time
is
exhausted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
time
is
exhausted.
the
solicitor
[laughter]
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
not
exhausted.
