as
this
--
as
the
government's
suggestion
that
if
we
accept
that
thesis,
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
broader
and
very
esoteric
other
arguments
that
are
involved
in
your
position.

the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
when
you
have
such
a
strong
ally
as
the
government
on
your
side
on
a
narrow
point
why
you
were
so
vigorous
in
throwing
up
away
that
assistance
and
need
for
still
getting
the
broader
point
decided.
