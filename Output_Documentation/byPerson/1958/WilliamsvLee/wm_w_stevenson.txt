mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
dispel
any
question
that
might
have
arisen
as
to
fair
dealing
or
sharp
dealing,
which
i'm
certain
that
mr.
littell
has
no
intention
of
inferring
the
sheep
that
were
attached
and
impounded
were
held
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
i
had
to
be
fair.
they
couldn't
be
turned
out
to
pasture.
they
had
to
be
feed
in
a
corral
as
large
as
this
courtroom.
in
over
a
period
of
time,
hauling
hay
and
grain
from
some
75
miles
away
didn't
run
those
costs
up.
those
were
costs
that
the
sheriff
assessed.
and
as
i
say,
i
--
i
wanted
to
dispel
any
question
in
anybody's
mind
that
there
was
a
problem
on
the
sharp
dealings
in
that
case.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
the
sheep
was
on
the
reservation
and
apparently
at
the
home
or
hold
on
of
the
then
defendants
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
and
we're
taken
by
truck
to
a
trading
post
on
the
reservation
and
placed
in
a
corral
layer
and
kept
there
for
a
period
of
time
until
the
--
a
sale
could
be
arranged
about
the
time
that
the
sale
came
along
the
lands
--
this
land
of
lands
use.
anyway,
we
have
more
sheep
than
we
started
with
me
to
start
it
over,
some
getting
another
sale.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
no,
some
of
them
were
turned
back.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
now,
justice
whittaker,
i
believe
you
referred
to
or
questioned
the
denetclaw
case,
a
very
recent
decision
in
the
state
of
arizona
particularly
with
respect
to
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
the
criminal
offense
occurred
within
state
territory.
so
there
can
be
no
question
on
that
point.
the
major
portion
of
the
navajo
reservation
lies
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
state
of
arizona.
the
offense,
if
any,
that
was
committed
--
was
committed
where
a
u.s.
highway
runs
through
the
reservation.
the
arrest
was
made
by
a
state
officer
and
out
of
that
came
this
denetclaw
case.
gentlemen,
the
navajo
reservation
is
approximately
24,000
square
miles
of
the
area.
the
principle
portion
of
it
lies
within
the
state
of
arizona.
it's
still,
it's
over
into
new
mexico
and
there
are
some
in
utah
and
i
am
not
certain
but
there
maybe
a
little
in
the
state
of
colorado.
so
that
you
have,
when
you
stop
and
think
about
it,
a
vast,
vast
area
involved.
now,
the
reservation
was
originally
created
by
the
treaty
of
1868,
and
either
by
executive
order
or
congressional
action,
additions
have
been
made
to
bring
it
up
to
the
size
that
it
presently
contains.
that
original
treaty
was
signed
by
the
agent
of
the
united
states,
i
believe
at
that
time,
was
one
of
the
generals
that
was
having
trouble
in
the
west
with
these
indians.
that
original
treaty
was
also
signed,
born
on
behalf
of
the
navajo
by
approximately
20
headmen
or
chieftains.
i
think
it's
important,
later
on,
i
--
i'll
bringing
it
up
here
so
that
you'll
have
that
picture.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
can't
tell
you.
it's
my
understanding
though
that
it's
in
the
neighborhood
of
some
80,000
people,
75,000
to
80,000
people
residing
there.
now,
in
1868,
worcester
versus
georgia
was
some
30
years
old.
that
case
had
been
decided
long
in
1932.
but
also
at
that
time,
in
1868,
the
principle
intercourse
between
what
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
white,
the
indians
was
bartered,
trade,
that
type
of
thing.
it
hadn't
reached
any
particular
extent
necessary
that
the
indian
might
want
and
that
the
trader
could
furnish.
today,
with
modern
means
of
travel
and
with
modern
means
of
communication
and
with
an
enlightened
policy
on
the
part
of
our
government
with
respect
to
the
education
of
these
people,
we
have
an
entirely
different
picture
in
the
state
of
arizona.
witness
the
fact
that
the
navajo
has
insisted
upon
his
right
to
vote
that
in
one
instance,
in
our
state
supreme
court,
a
franchise
to
operate
a
trucking
line
was
granted
to
a
navajo,
a
member
of
the
tribe,
the
fact
that
they
can,
if
they
see
fit
and
if
they
have
the
qualifications
to
run
for
public
office
in
the
state
of
arizona.
in
fact,
in
the
most
recent
election,
there
was
a
gentleman
from
window
rock
who
ran
for
state
representative.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
it
was
--
i
can't
tell
you
the
district,
justice.
it
was
within
apache
county.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
outside
of
the
reservation.
it
would
cover
part
of
and
part
out
as
i
understood
it.
i
haven't
got
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that's
right.
there
are
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
we
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
no,
we're
talking
about
the
--
the
navajo
who
resides
on
the
reservation
but
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
one
of
the
counties
that
encompass
portions
of
the
reservation,
running
for
office.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
they
must
certainly
be.
now,
i
--
i
am
sorry,
i
haven't
checked
that.
i
do
know
this
that
they
can
and
have
run
for
public
office
in
apache
county.
there
are
sufficient
members
of
the
tribe
who
properly
organized
to
elect
the
entire
board
of
supervisors
for
the
county,
and
enact
the
ordinances
and
regulations,
promulgate
the
rules
by
which
your
county
governors
operated.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
there's
none.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
they
have
the
right
to
vote.
that
was
right.
but
not
for
any
state
officers
or
legislators
representing
any
particular
segments
of
the
reservation
itself.
their
right
to
vote
would
be
limited
to
the
--
the
right
to
vote
for
the
officers
that
--
that
i
would
vote
for
that
is
to
say
within
a
certain
county.
you
see
the
area
is
so
large
that
it
encompasses
parts
of
navajo,
apache
and
greenlee
counties.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
follow
you.
no.
the
--
the
county
line,
if
i
get
the
--
your
question,
the
county
line
is
partly
in
and
partly
out.
in
short,
let's
put
it
this
way
that
perhaps
half
of
the
area
lies
within
the
exterior
limits
of
the
present
navajo
reservation
and
half
out.
but
nonetheless,
they
are
citizens
and
residents.
our
supreme
court
has
held
that
they
are
competent.
the
navajo
was
a
competent
witness
in
judicial
proceedings
that
he
can
serve
as
a
juror.
now
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
we
have
had
one
or
two
in
my
county
at
coconino
that
served
as
jurors.
now,
i
don't
cite
those
as
benefits
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
given
this
tribe.
i
merely
cite
them
to
indicate
the
economic
change
that
has
taken
place
in
some
125
years
since
the
days
of
worcester
verus
georgia.
these
changes
present
new,
different
and
very
intriguing
problems.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
commercial
intercourse
and
that
is
what
we
have
here
inevitably
brings
disputes
and
problems
and
legal
questions
that
demand
trial
for
a
determination
thereof.
the
problem
in
this
case
was
fairly
simple.
it
was
the
sale
of
merchandise
between
the
trader
on
the
reservation
operating
a
store
on
that
reservation
and
--
and
then
residing
on
that
reservation
and
buying
from
them
was
a
fairly
simple
one.
but
it's
easy
to
conceive
of
a
myriad
of
more
difficult
problems
in
the
field
of
civil
law
that
are
bound
to
come
along.
that
is
why
we
want
to
see
it
decided
on
the
broad
basis
not
on
a
narrow
regulation.
at
the
outset,
we
were
immediately
confronted
with
this
problem
is
that
conceivable
within
the
united
states.
there
is
an
area
approximating
the
size
of
the
state
of
kentucky
in
which
there's
no
civil
law
in
search
of
a
forum.
it
was
our
--
it
was
--
that
the
place
to
look
but
to
the
federal
courts,
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
congress,
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
so,
i
believe
that
by
legislation
assumed
exclusive
jurisdiction,
that
is
they
could
oust
the
state
of
any
jurisdiction.
congress
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
don't
think
they
need
to.
i
think
we
have
it
to
a
certain
extent.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
we
trust
this
decision
may
clear
it
up,
one
way
or
the
other.
but
it
could
be
clear
by
a
congressional
enactment
but
it's
my
position
that
the
congressional
enactment
in
this
instance
and
on
this
point
would
not
be
much
more
than
analogy
because
i
don't
think
that
arizona
has
ever
ceded
or
lost
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
it
was
partly
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
it
was
possibly
the
choice
of
a
wrong
verb.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
but
none
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
and
nonentheless
are
the
basis
for
saying
that
is
my
argument
as
it
unfold
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
and
i'm
coming
right
to
it.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
what
treaties
were
involved
in
those
states
with
respect
to
indian
tribes
residing
therein.
i
don't
know
what
is
contained
in
the
enabling
act
of
any
of
those
states
so
i
can't
say
that
it's
meaningless
insofar,
say,
california
is
concern
or
nevada
or
utah
or
any
of
the
other
western
states.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
it
would
have.
to
this
extent,
we
would
--
arizona
would
then
have
had
the
criminal
jurisdiction
as
well
as
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
all
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
all
right,
fine.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
--
my
position
is
that
it
would
not
except
possibly
in
the
field
of
domestic
relations
and
not
the
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well,
the
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right
because
the
federal
government
through
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
has
regulated
the
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
sales.
no,
they
have
taken
over
precisely.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--precisely.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
under
the
new
proposed
bill,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
have
changed
that
situation
with
respect
to
indian
goods
of
that
nature.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right
and
it
would
clarify
the
picture.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
basically,
when
i
got
into
this
matter
with
sometime
after
the
suit
had
been
filed,
i
felt
that
we
still
had
jurisdiction,
not
--
not
that
we
still
have
it
that
--
but
that
we
did
have
it
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
in
a
civil
matter.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
over
the
lands,
over
the
lands
not
the
people
inhabiting
that
area.
over
the
land.
and
that
are
--
are
--
the
disclaimer
in
our
constitution
and
the
disclaimer
appearing
in
our
enabling
act,
that
was
--
which
was
carried
in
to
the
constitution
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
are
almost
identical
in
language
with
that
in
the
state
of
montana.
and
in
that
particular
instance
in
the
state
of
montana,
that
disclaimer
was
interpreted
to
mean
jurisdiction
over
lands
not
people.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
congress
made
no
distinction.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
not
that
i
recollect.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
we
have
not
change.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
not
change.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
it.
it
is
our
position
that
jurisdiction
is
vested
in
the
state
courts
of
arizona
except
where
congress
has
assumed
jurisdiction
or
reserved
the
same
pursuant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
constitution
amendment
10
provides
that
the
federal
government
is
one
of
delegated
powers.or
power
is
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
nor
prohibited
by
the
constitution
or
reserved
to
the
states.
so
looking
at
that
law,
we
find
nothing
there
that
precludes
us
from
assuming
arizona
has
jurisdiction.
the
united
states
constitution
article
1,
section
8
provides,
“congress
shall
have
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes.”
a
question
immediately
arises
but
it's
meant
by
commerce.that's
been
defined
by
this
court.
the
u.s.
versus
holliday,
one
of
the
older
cases,
3
wall.
407,
defines
it
as
traffic
intercourse
even
more
than
that,
the
buying,
selling
and
exchanging
commodities.
certainly,
the
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states
might
assume
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
civil
matters
involving
white
indians
but
it
can't
be
implied
from
this
that
it
automatically
has
it.
that's
the
commerce
clause.
now,
our
enabling
act,
section
20
thereof
provides
and
the
people
of
arizona
covenant
thereby
that
until
the
title
shall
have
been
extinguished,
the
same
shall
be
in
remain
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
i'm
referring
thereto
lands.
article
20
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
provides
that
people
disclaim
all
right
entitled
to
the
lands
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
which
lands
are
owned
or
held
by
an
indian
tribe
until
the
title
says
tribes
shall
have
been
extinguished
and
that
the
same
shall
be
in
remain
subject
to
a
disposition
and
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
again,
they
are
referring
to
the
land
not
the
peoples
inhabiting
those
lands.
as
i
said
a
moment
earlier,
the
draper
case,
which
is
cited,
i
think,
in
both
petitioner's
and
respondent's
briefs
interprets
montana's
enabling
act
clause
as
covering
only
land
and
not
people.
now,
as
of
that
moment
having
what
i
would
refer
to
as
the
basic
law,
we
--
we
find
nothing
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
of
arizona
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no,
our
supreme
court
has
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
that's
the
only
case
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
that
raises
the
point.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
my
argument
now.
and
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
the
lands
versus
the
people,
our
supreme
court
based
it
--
if
you
could
give
me
one
moment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
(inaudible)
mr.
chief
justice,
they
didn't
mention
that
point.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
now,
then,
for
many
years,
there
has
been
absolutely
no
question
but
that
the
united
states
--
the
federal
court
system
had
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
criminal
matters.
but
if
we
take
a
glance
back
to
these
cases
in
history,
we
find
109
u.s.
556,
ex
parte
crow
dog,
in
which
case
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
to
punish
the
murder
of
one
indian
by
another
on
an
indian
reservation.
now,
after
that,
congress
came
along
and
enacted
effective
legislation.
i
think
i
maybe
in
error
on
this
but
i
think
it
was
10
major
crimes
act.
there
was
a
major
crimes
act
or
whatever
they
call
it
at
the
time.
now,
then,
that
has
been
because
of,
again,
economic
influences
developed
and
enlarged
by
virtue
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
which
indicates
or
evidences
an
assumption
by
the
united
states
all
criminal
jurisdiction.
with
respect
to
civil
jurisdiction,
we
have
the
one
point
in
arizona
and
that
was
begay
versus
miller
and
that
case
follows
the
decision
in
an
old
united
states
case,
u.s.versus
quiver,
241
u.s.
602.
in
that
--
in
the
begay
case,
the
court
recognized
the
rights
of
tribal
indians
to
deal
with
their
people
amongst
themselves
on
personal
and
domestic
affairs.
now,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
breadth,
that
was
all
that
was
covered
in
that.
it
was
a
domestic
affair,
a
divorce
that
was
involved.
the
husband
or
the
wife
whichever
had
gotten
a
divorce
in
the
state
court
and
the
other
has
gone
to
a
tribal
court,
and
done
the
same
thing.
the
state
court
--
i
guess,
it
was
the
wife
who
went
to
the
state
court.
the
wife
was
granted
alimony.
he
didn't
pay.
he
was
cited
on
a
contempt
charge
and
put
in
jail
and
that's
the
way
this
case
came
up.
the
husband
had
a
divorce
from
the
tribal
court
that
was
considered
bona
fide
and
valid.
our
supreme
court
says
in
matters
relating
to
domestic
affairs,
we
recognize
their
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
my
interpretation
of
it.
yes.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
it
was
limited
to
that
one
field,
domestic
relations
and
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
person
affairs.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
begay
versus
william.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well,
pardon
me,
begay
versus
miller.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
as
i
recollect
it
was,
yes,
but
not
outside
the
scope
of
that
very
limited
area.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
the
basis,
apparently,
was
that
the
husband
filed
--
the
wife's
suit
was
pending
in
the
state
court
and
the
husband
went
into
the
tribal
court
and
had
a
more
effective
procedural
remedy
from
this
so
there
was
a
--
a
divorce
at
the
time
it
first
occurred
then
outside.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
are
you
saying
to
me
that
in
the
begay
case,
your
understanding
is
that
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
thing
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction?
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
it
was
influenced
by
that
tribe.
yes.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well
--
now,
the
--
justice
(inaudible),
he
says
one
action
was
pending
that
is
the
tribal
action
when
they
brought
the
suit
in
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
didn't
gather
that
from
the
opinion.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes.
and
that
it
is
quite
frequently
done.
the
indian
man
and
indian
wife
had
come
in,
got
a
divorce
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
not
done.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
challenged
until
we
got
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
in
--
into
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
right
here.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
was
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
the
tribal
courts
--
i'll
put
it
this
way.
so
far
as
i
know,
the
tribal
courts
do
have
because
our
state
supreme
court
recognized
as
valid
the,
shall
we
call,
the
decree
of
divorce,
it
was
entered
by
a
tribal
court
on
the
navajo
reservation.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
the
tribal
court's
ground
--
grant
divorce
on
the
basis
of
no
law
that
i
know
of.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
it
has
to
be
tribal
customs.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
they
have
done
it.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
they
have
done
it.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
they
have
done
that.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
now,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
is
right,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
you
see
in
the
--
in
this
--
the
instant
case,
the
begay
case,
the
husband
went
to
the
tribal
court
and
instituted
his
actions.
the
wife
and
--
went
into
the
state
courts
and
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
on
the
basis
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
of
his
argument?
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well,
it's
readily
apparent
that
a
wife,
an
indian
convicted
of
a
crime
or
charged
with
a
crime,
committed
on
the
reservation,
is
going
to
make
this
appeal,
say
--
be
properly
protected,
that's
readily
apparent.
that
is
why
the
body
of
law
relating
to
criminal
law
on
those
reservations
is
so
well
defined
and
clear
but
it
is
not
readily
apparent
why
a
trader
would
be
hard-headed
about
$361
and
will
clear
up
the
united
states
supreme
court
on
the
question
of
civil
jurisdiction.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
[laughter]
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
that's
not
all.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well,
the
position
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
the
position
i
took
was
that
it
--
it
had
been
dismissed
pursuant
to
motion
pending
his
state
of
claim
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
now,
you
--
i
think
they're
wondering
about
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
or
the
acceptance
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
don't
make
any
point
about
it
at
all.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no.
no,
justice.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
he
can
do
it
in
either
sides
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that's
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
looking
back
as
a
wonderful
point,
at
the
time
that
this
case
came
on
for
trial,
we
just
stipulate
it
as
to
the
facts.
they
were
interested
principally
in
the
broad
point,
where
does
the
civil
jurisdiction
lie?
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
--
i
think
the
broader
issue
that
you
probably
are
referring
to,
your
honor,
is
the
question
of
where
that
jurisdiction
lies,
that
civil
jurisdiction.
and
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well,
without
going
back
--
refer
to
the
pleading
file,
i
can't
tell
you
but
it
seems
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that's
constituted
the
fairness.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
prior
to
the
finding
of
counterclaim,
your
honor,
is
we
have
stipulated
that
their
answers
did
not
constitute
(inaudible)
so
far
as
they
were
questioning
jurisdiction
all
the
way.
they
challenged
all
the
way
that
brought
the
--
the
question.
now,
i
can't
give
you
the
--
i
can't
recollect
that
--
out
of
my
mind
that
the
point
that
you're
getting
at
on
that
counterclaim,
what
transpired
on,
i
don't
know
(inaudible)
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
understood,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice,
that
this
constituted
a
list
of
claims
outstanding
filed
by
--
in
some
instances
of
white
indian
traders
against
indian
(inaudible)
of
the
transactions
arising
on
the
reservation.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
the
tribal
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
these
are
tribal
law.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
and
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
way
to
--
to
oppose
that
argument.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that's
right.
well,
you
--
you
raised
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
come
to.
and
i
know
of
no
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--in
a
way
to
--
to
get
out
of
except
to
point
out
that
the
navajo
tribe
is
not
a
corporation.
it
doesn't
have
a
constitution.
it
appears
to
me,
it's
an
association
of
individuals.
now,
let
me
get
to
a
very,
what
i
consider,
dangerous
position,
that
being
the
case,
then
you
and
i
and
67
others
can
form
an
association
and
set
up
our
own
government.
we
could
set
up
own
courts
by
what
authority
is
the
tribal
courts
created.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well,
the
regulations,
the
interior
department
regulation
arise
out
of
19
stat.
200,
power
to
appoint
traders
with
indians,
the
permission
of
indian
affairs
shall
have
the
sole
power
and
authority
to
appoint
traders
to
the
indian
tribe
and
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
that
he
deem
just
and
proper,
specifying
the
kind
and
quantity
of
goods.
the
price
of
which
(inaudible)
shall
be
sold
to
the
indians.
now
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
but
now
--
chief
justice,
you're
not
referring
to
the
act
of
congress,
you're
referring
to
see
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
commission
of
indian
affairs
on
that
point.
and
the
--
that
when
--
specifies
that
all
trade
shall
be
at
the
traders'
risk.
now,
the
--
the
brief
of
the
united
states
amplifies
that
or
expand
it
into
this
type
of
thing,
but
that
gives
--
that
takes
away
from
the
state
any
jurisdiction
it
had.
but
when
the
regulation
says
that
all
trade
shall
be
at
the
--
the
traders'
risk,
all
credit
extended
shall
be
at
the
traders'
risk.
i
failed
to
be
able
to
interpret
that
as
meaning
that
you're
going
to
have
to
go
into
an
entirely
different
set
of
courts.
i
--i
don't
--
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
strain
and
an
unnatural
interpretation
of
that
small
phrase.
i
would
think
i
should
give
one
or
two
moments
to
this
worcester
versus
georgia
which
is
unquestionably
the
leading
case
on
indian
law
cited
time
again
without
end.
and
in
that
case,
chief
justice
marshall's
opinion
was
based
on
this
type
of
finding.
this
treaty,
hopewell
does
explicitly
recognize
the
national
character
of
the
cherokee,
their
right
to
self-government
and
does
guarantee
their
lands.
cherokee
nation
is
a
distinct
community
occupying
its
own
territory
with
boundaries
accurately
described
in
which
the
laws
of
georgia
can
have
no
force,
and
which
the
citizens
the
georgia
have
no
right
to
enter
but
with
the
assent
of
the
cherokees
themselves
found
that
the
cherokee
nation
was
not
a
part
of
the
state
of
georgia.
they
were
attempting
to
extend
their
county
limits
to
incorporate
part
of
the
state
of
georgia
but
this
decision
is
based
on
the
fact
that
that
was
not
a
part
of
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
with
this
reservation,
the
navajo
that
we're
talking
about
and
that
is
our
problem
here,
it
is
encompassed
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
state
of
arizona.
well,
gentlemen,
in
summation,
it
is
our
position
that
the
sovereignty
of
arizona
is
plenary
over
its
territory
except
where
that
sovereignty
is
reserved
to
the
u.s.
or
has
been
relinquished
and
assumed
by
the
government.
but
the
congress
of
the
united
states
may
assume
jurisdiction
as
granted.
we
--
i
don't
question
that
to
the
extent
that
such
assumption
of
state
courts
would
be
the
best
of
the
jurisdiction
and
here
is
where
it
happened.
neither
our
enabling
act
nor
our
constitution
has
divested
the
state
of
arizona
of
jurisdiction
either
criminal
or
civil
that
came
through
legislation
of
this
congress.
we
submit
on
the
basis
of
foregoing
that
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
--
that
is
my
understanding
of
it,
yes.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
if
the
--
if
the
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
the
penalty
in
the
state
act
is
broader
than
the
penalty
set
up
in
the
federal
act
then
the
penalty
in
the
federal
act
applies
for
deciding
that
opinion.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
true.
i
--
i
ran
across
one
the
other
day.
i
can't
think
of
the
name
of
it,
that's
why
i
mentioned
that.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
distinction
was
based
on
this,
the
fact
that
in
the
begay
case,
that
was
the
divorce
case
in
the
arizona
supreme
court,
they
confined
their
opinion
to
that
one
narrow
point
recognizing
the
right
of
the
navajos
to
govern
themselves
with
respect
to
personal
and
domestic
affairs
involving
their
tribes
and
their
people.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
right.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
do
i
have
anything
to
say
--
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
--
to
the
effect
that
that
does
destroy?
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
my
answer
to
you
is
this.
the
--
the
phrase
often
it
shall
be
at
the
traders'
own
risk
to
me
means
only
one
thing
that
the
united
states
of
america
as
the
guardian
of
the
navajo
indian
isn't
underwriting
that
bill
and
i
sense
the
word.
now,
that's
what
it
means
to
me
and
--
that
simple
language.
i
don't
think
that
it
means
that
state
courts
are
ousted
of
jurisdiction.
i
think
if
that
had
been
the
intent,
then
i
would
have
gone
further
and
say
more.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
--
i'll
put
it
this
way.
i
thought
that
mr.
littell's
reply
brief
covered
the
point
admirably.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
to
that
extent.[laughter]
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
if
i
said
that
i
--
i
perhaps
misstated.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
our
supreme
court
justify
that
this
way
looking
at
the
code
of
federal
regulations
and
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
commission
of
indian
affairs
with
respect
to
trading
on
the
navajo
and
hopi
reservation,
that
court
said,
“well,
the
united
states
has
assumed
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
this
type
of
property,
sheep,
therefore,
the
sheriff
of
apache
county
could
not
possibly
have
a
test
of
ship
and
sold
them.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that's
--
that's
all
i've
got
out
of
the
state
supreme
court
on
that.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
that
is
correct.
it
goes
back
a
little
into
the
history
that
they
have
abandoned
in
the
past
a
nomadic
type
of
people,
sheep
herders,
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
what
the
government
has
attempted
over
a
period
of,
let's
say,
since
the
first
term
of
franklin
roosevelt
as
president
is
to
encourage
these
people
in
a
way
of
letting
--
pardon
me,
give
them
a
livelihood,
build
up
their
herds,
build
up
their
sheep
so
the
government
has
put
money
into
it,
as
i
understand
it,
by
furnishing
sheep.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
so
they
feel
that
they
have
some
claim.
mr.
wm.
w.
stevenson
no,
it
isn't
a
great
of
difference.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
