justice

mr.
stevenson,
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
stevenson,
i
have
a
couple
of
questions
which
--
from
my
own
information
of
ohio
or
even
sixth
circuit,
we
didn't
have
any
indian
cases
and
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
on
this
subject.
but
--
first
of
all,
am
i
right
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
of
criminal
offenses
committed
by
one
indian
against
another
indian
within
this
reservation,
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
generally,
subject
to,
perhaps,
qualifications,
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
for
criminal
offenses
by
one
indian
against
another
indian
committed
within
this
reservation
because
of
federal
legislation,
you
say.
and
secondly,
i
didn't
quite
get
the
distinction
that
you
made
in
cases
of
jurisdiction
in
civil
cases
of
wrong
or
litigation
between
one
indian
and
--
and
another
indian
or
within
the
reservation.
you
made
a
distinction
between
domestic
relations
and
family
cases
on
the
one
hand
and
all
other
types
of
civil
cases
on
the
other
i
thought
and
i
wondered
upon
what
that
distinction
was
based.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
told
us
but
if
so,
i
missed
it,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
is
it
--
so
that
the
--
the
distinction
that
you
pointed
out
stems
only
from
that
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
the
begay
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
from
any
--
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
