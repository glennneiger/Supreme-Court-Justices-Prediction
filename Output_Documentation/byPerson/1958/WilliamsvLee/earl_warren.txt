mr.
littell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
littell,
do
you
mean
that
--
that
we
--
if
we
should
hold
against
you
on
your
major
propositions,
your
general
issue
as
you
raised
it
that
we
would
be
foreclosed
from
deciding
in
favor
of
your
client
on
the
one
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
must
abide
by
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
it's
untenable,
does
that
mean
legally
untenable
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
littell.
mr.
stevenson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevenson,
i
don't
believe
mr.
littell
said
that
--
where
would
the
sheep
at
the
time
they
were
attached,
were
they
on
the
reservation
or
off
the
reservation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
matter
of
interest,
how
many
--
about
how
many
indians
are
there
on
this
reservation,
mr.
stevenson,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
your
position
that
--
that
the
act
of
1953
was
meaningless
so
far
as
giving
greater
jurisdiction
to
the
states
of
minnesota
and
california
and
--
and
oregon
and
the
other
states
that
were
involved
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
i
mean
is
this.
if
they
have
included
you
in
this
act,
that
is
the
state
of
arizona,
would
it
confer
any
greater
jurisdiction
on
your
courts
than
you
now
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
take
the
civil
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
take
with
the
civil
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
have
granted
you
any
greater
civil
jurisdiction
than
you
have
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
congress
must
thought
so
because
it
gave
to
your
state
and
other
states
that
were
not
included
in
that
act
the
opportunity
to
become
--
to
get
under
the
umbrella
there
by
changing
your
laws
so
as
to
do
certain
things
and
assume
certain
jurisdictions,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
assuming
that
that
act
does
something
by
way
of
granting
jurisdiction
to
those
five
states
over
and
above
the
jurisdiction
you
have,
your
constitution
and
laws
at
the
present
time
forbid
you
from
assuming
that
jurisdiction,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
congress
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
made
that
distinction
in
the
1953
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
distinction
between
land
and
personals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
just
granted
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
--
over
the
reservations
and
saying
that
those
states
that
were
prohibited
by
their
own
constitution
and
--
and
statutes
could
come
under
the
act
if
they
should
change.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
have
not
change.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
your
court,
your
supreme
court
interpreted
that
constitutional
amendment
so
as
to
distinguish
between
jurisdiction
over
land
and
people
before
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
it
--
did
it
in
its
opinion
here
distinguish
it
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
basis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
it
did
specifically
base
it
upon
that
distinction
between
the
land
and
--
and
the
individuals
or
is
that
merely
your
argument
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
supreme
court
say
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
then
point
is
--
is
open
in
your
state.
it
just
hasn't
been
decided.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
so
it's
a
matter
of
first
impression
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
take
it
that
you're
--
you're
interested
more
than
in
--
just
dollars
and
cents
in
this
case,
are
you
not,
because
i
noticed
you
joined,
you
and
mr.
littell
joined
in
saying
that
the
--
the
narrower
issue
is
really
not
involved
here,
it's
a
broader
issue
as
to
whether
they
do
have
jurisdiction
that
bothers
you?
you
--
you're
not
particularly
interested
in
--
in
the
money
value
of
this
case,
are
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevenson,
have
you
seen
the
--
the
memorandum
that
mr.
littell
submitted
with
this
long
list
of
cases
showing
that
your
courts
there
have
accepted
jurisdiction
in
--
in
cases
involving
commercial
transactions
on
the
reservation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
ask
you,
if
this
--
if
this
is
the
usual
practice
in
arizona
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
these
are
the
tribal
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
oh,
tribal
courts.
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
--
i
misconceive
the
report
that
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
isn't
the
answer
to
that
that
either
of
the
treaties
--
the
treaty
would
be
united
states
or
congressional
act
or
regulations
of
the
department
of
interior
to
permit
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
subject
also
to
the
act
of
--
the
act
of
congress,
is
it
not,
which
says
that
white
traders
shall
not
sue
on
obligations
that
--
incurred
in
the
reservation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stevenson,
may
i
ask
you
this
one
more
--
one
more
question?
in
view
of
your
broad
claim
of
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
these
matters,
how
do
you
make
the
distinction
between
your
jurisdiction
over
--
over
this
individual
and
his
business
affair
on
the
one
hand
and
then
say
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
so
far
as
the
attachment
was
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
what
your
court
--
your
court
seemed
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
two
views,
supreme
court
and
how
do
you
justify
that
in
your
argument
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
that
your
argument
to
us
and
is
that
the
basis
on
which
you
would
want
us
to
--
to
distinguish
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
littell,
so
i
won't
have
to
interrupt
you
during
your
--
your
closing
argument,
i
just
like
to
ask
you
to
what
point
you
--
you
filed
this
memorandum.
i
--
i
misinterpreted
it.
i
--
i
thought
these
were
recent
cases
that
had
been
filed
in
the
state
courts
but
i
was
corrected
by
counsel.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
now
just
what
your
point
was
concerning
it.
would
you
mind
telling
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
will
be.[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
minutes
more
if
you
should
want
it
up
to
lunch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
recess,
i
see
mr.
marquis
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
marquis,
you
were
on
the
brief
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
solicitor
general
and
would
you
mind
having
the
solicitor
general
respond
to
this
if,
in
his
opinion,
it
--
it
calls
for
any
response?
thank
you
very
much.
we
--
we'll
(inaudible).
