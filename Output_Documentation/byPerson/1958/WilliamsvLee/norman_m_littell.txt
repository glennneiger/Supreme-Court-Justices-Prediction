mr.
norman
m.
littell
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
this
case
is
a
very
simple
one
on
the
facts
that
has
very
complex,
indeed
very
deep
current
certification.
actually,
it
is
an
action
for
debt,
originates
an
action
for
debt
by
a
trader,
hugh
lee
on
the
lee
trading
post
ganado,
arizona,
in
the
middle
of
the
navajo
reservation.
and
the
defendants
are
two
navajos,
husband
and
wife
whose
flock
of
sheep
was
attached
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
a
debt
of
$361.22.
after
some
delay
in
holding
the
sheep
at
the
plaintiff's
trading
post
where
they
were
carried
for
and
at
a
per
diem
charge,
they
were
finally
sold
to
sheriff's
sale
for
a
total
sum
including
$2
in
cash,
but
the
plaintiff,
for
some
reason,
put
up
$272,
the
total
cost
of
maintaining
the
sheep
during
their
incarceration,
shall
we
say,
was
$246.72.
so
that
had
the
plaintiff
not
paid
in
cash
in
his
anxiety
over
this
case
the
sum
of
$280,
there
would
have
been
a
net
balance
to
credit
on
this
debt
of
$27.28
and
had
the
--
i
cannot
refrain
from
commenting
in
passing
that
had
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
respect
to
this
particular
point
then
maintained,
he
could
then
have
attached
another
flock
of
sheep
and
repeated
the
process
calling
up
on
the
debt
of
this
proof
presumably
at
the
rate
of
$27
or
$30
in
attachment.
now,
actually,
with
the
payment
of
cash,
the
final
judgment
was
$82.22
which
is
still
standing
against
these
--
these
defendants
and
therefore
other
property
can
be
--
be
attached
for
reasons
explained
in
the
course
of
my
discussion.
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
held
that
that
attachment
was
invalid.
in
fact,
in
the
superior
court
proceedings
below
beginning
there,
the
superior
court
judge,
when
the
defendants
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
proceeding
this
matter,
held
that
having
obtained
the
citizenship,
they
were
subject
to
the
state
jurisdiction,
i
need
not
to
spell
out
superior
court's
ruling
anymore
than
that
perhaps
under
the
issues
in
the
supreme
court,
where,
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
sustained
these
views.
however,
it
reversed
the
district
court
--
the
--
the
superior
court
on
the
--
in
respect
to
the
attachment
on
the
grounds
and
for
the
reason
that
a
specific
regulation
of
the
bureau
of
--
of
the
department
of
interior,
bureau
of
indian
affairs
forbad
the
sale
of
livestock
without
a
--
an
expressed
permit
by
the
superintendent.
in
this
area,
the
federal
regulations,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
held
did
in
fact
preempted
appeal.
and
therefore,
the
attachment
was
invalidated.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
personal
service
in
the
reservation,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
indeed.
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
over
these
petitioners,
none
whatever.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that
is
only
the
more
trivial
of
the
reasons,
your
honor,
and
i
will
come
to
that
point
later
in
my
argument,
but
the
state
of
arizona
has
neither
civil
nor
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indians
on
the
reservation
at
all.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
may.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
everything
done
was
without
prejudice
to
the
basic
contention
of
the
state
court
lack
of
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
counterclaim
was
dismissed,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
well,
your
honor,
we
can
only
contend
that
the
whole
proceeding
was
totally
lacking
in
basic
jurisdiction
and
not
the
defendants
themselves
cannot
convey
jurisdictions
where
they
--
where
--
where
the
basic
proceeding
is
lacking
in
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
to
narrow
the
issues
to
those
that
are
before
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
as
i
have
said
briefly,
did
say
that
the
federal
regulation
respect
to
say
livestock
had
preempted
that
field
and
invalidated
the
attachment.
on
the
broader
ground
that
a
regulation
controlling
the
credits
--
controlling
the
transaction
between
traders
and
indians
on
the
reservation
specifically
provided
that
if
credit
is
extended,
it
should
be
at
the
traders'
own
risk.
in
respect
to
the
contention
of
counsel
for
the
defendants
below
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
by
reason
to
construction
of
this
regulation,
one
contention.
the
other
contention
that
there
was
a
basic
contention,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
anyway
over
indians
on
a
transaction
arising
in
the
navajo
reservation.
but
on
this
narrower
ground,
that
the
credit
provisions
of
the
traders'
regulations
left
the
traders
entirely
at
their
own
risk
and
made
the
transaction
unenforceable.
the
court
said
that
the
only
thing
before
it
was
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
that
the
effect
of
this
regulation
went
to
the
merits.
it
could
be
plead
on
the
merits.
it
did
not
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
and
this
regulation
could
be
plead
if
necessary
on
the
merits
but
did
not
go
to
the
jurisdiction.
the
court
reviews
the
law
of
the
situation
as
it
considered
to
be,
recognizes
that
there
is
preemption
of
the
--
of
regulations,
but
where
congress
has
not
specifically
prohibited
and
the
state
has
the
jurisdictions.
they
quote
some
cases
to
this
effect
which
are
to
some
extent
not
correctly
represented
but
in
any
event,
on
certiorari
to
these
courts,
out
of
the
assignment
of
errors
or
points
on
appeal
below,
there
emerged
here
two
basic
points
which
ought
to
be
considered.
first,
our
main
contention
and
the
one
consonant
with
a
long
line
of
decisions
from
worcester
against
--
from
the
worcester
case
in
--
against
georgia
in
--
in
5
peters
down
through
many,
many
years
that
the
court
--
that
no
jurisdiction
of
the
persons
but
had
by
the
state
court
because
they
are
navajo
--
navajo
indians
residing
on
the
navajo
reservation
and
because
the
state
does
not,
broadly
speaking,
have
civil
or
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
i
agree
there's
no
immunity
of
the
enclave
for
certain
functions
of
the
state
arising
from
its
jurisdiction
of
that
territory.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
as
to
navajo
indians,
absolutely.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
not
of
the
reservation.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
not
off.
no.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
right.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
second
point
is,
and
here,
i
must
take
a
moment
of
explanation
because
in
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
is
personally
served,
not
for
a
transaction
on
this
reservation,
not
for
this
transaction.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
your
honor.
in
my
--
in
my
view,
he
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
on
this
reservation,
that's
right.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
could.
your
cases
have
so
held.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
well,
i
think
the
only
answer
to
your
--
to
your
honor's
point
on
the
counterclaim
is
the
fact
that
the
state
court
did
not
treat
it
as
a
waiver
of
jurisdiction.
they
accepted
it
as
--
as
subject
to
the
stipulation
throughout
that
--
that
the
court
was
about
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
well,
i
think
there
are
many
surprising
doctrines
in
--
in
the
question
of
--
of
jurisdiction
over
indian
affairs
to
the
average
common
law
lawyer.
there's
no
question
about
it.
i
found
some
surprising
ones
myself
when
i
took
on
the
responsibility
of
general
counsel
of
the
navajo
tribe
as
one
does
when
you
read
admiralty.
there's
a
slippered
branch
of
the
law.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
there
are
two
schools
of
thought
in
that
case
quite
frankly.
that's
a
$64
question
in
this
particular
issue
and
there
are
two
schools
of
thought.
one
of
them
is,
he
may
not
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
the
other
is
that
he
--
he
may
that
in
going
off
the
reservation,
he
has
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
off
the
reservation
and
that
he
could
be
sued
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
in
toto.
and
the
process,
in
our
view,
illegally
served
upon
the
reservation.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that
is
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
and
the
case
the
same
court
that
we
are
reviewing
here
within
three
weeks
of
this
decision
held
precisely
what
your
honor
has
in
mind
in
the
denetclaw
case
that
there
is
no
criminal
jurisdiction
on
a
highway
in
the
--
in
the
reservation
expressing
great
regrets
if
there
were
not
--
there
was
not.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it's
not
state
territory.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
right.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
can.
your
--
this
court
has
so
held
that
the
--
even
where
this
indian
lacks
citizenship
that
he
is
nevertheless
a
person
and
can
sue
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
completely.
if
i
may
submit
it
to
your
honor,
in
the
emancipation
of
the
indian
which
is
the
process
in
which
we
are
living
and
it's
an
advanced
stage
today.
if
there
were
10
points
necessary
to
the
emancipation
of
the
indian,
let's
assume
a
hypothetical
10
criteria,
number
five
is
citizenship.
my
distinguished
counsel
and
the
courts
that
he
is
depending
or
shocked
that
the
indian
could
be
a
citizen
and
not
be
subjected
to
all
the
incidents
of
citizenship
including
liability
for
this
suit.
i
say
that
citizenship
was
number
five
on
the
list
of
10,
he
hasn't
attained
upon
yet.
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
comment
indicates,
there
are
all
sorts
of
seemingly
inconsistent
immunities,
inconsistent
with
the
common
law
as
we
know
it
until
that
complete
emancipation
has
arrived
that
we
have
thousands
of
them
that
have
arrived
at
that
state
and
they're
living
around
in
the
country
just
as
you
and
i
can
be
sued
and
sue
just
like
anybody
else,
that
this
immunity
does
not
follow
the
infinite
--
the
indian
ad
infinitum.
but
it's
perfectly
clear
by
the
doctrines
of
this
court,
reviewed
in
our
brief,
that
there
is
no
civil
or
criminal
jurisdiction
until
congress
has
granted
it,
except,
i
must
make
a
qualification
as
you
think
i'm
painting
a
black
and
white
picture
and
a
ridiculous
one,
there
are
incidents
to
territorial
sovereignty
of
the
state.
there
are
sections
to
this
vast
reservation,
the
biggest
in
united
states,
24,000
square
miles
within
new
mexico
and
utah
and
--
and
a
bit
in
colorado
and
--
and
arizona.
it
would
be
futile
to
put
that
into
the
territorial
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
arizona
if
there
weren't
some
incidents
and
your
court
--
this
court
has
held.
if
the
navajos
had
leased
land
to
a
white
man
on
the
reservation
and
he
was
raising
his
sheep
there
or
grazing
livestock,
he
could
be
taxed
by
the
state.
and
i
would
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
say
that
that
white
man
on
the
reservation
is
exempt
from
process
of
the
state,
maybe
because
on
the
reservation
of
law.
he
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction.
all
of
the
traders
in
this
--
in
this
reservation
pay
taxes
to
the
state.
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
their
personal
property
could
not
be
attached
by
a
legal
process
served
in
the
reservation.
although
i
reserve
the
qualification
that
if
the
navajos,
under
section
13
of
their
treaty
of
1868
were
back
any
sheriff
to
enter
the
premises,
i
would
reserved
the
right
and
let
have
anybody
quote
me
in
this
argument
to
say
that
i
have
waived
this
forever.
i
would
there
to
contend
the
navajos
have
denied
access
to
this
reservation
and
you
can't
come
on,
but
the
general
law
is
the
contrary.
you
asked
against
fisher,
oh
i
can
--
in
these
cases
in
our
brief.
so
that
--
that
territorial
jurisdiction
has
followed
onto
the
reservation
as
far
as
the
commission
of
crimes
by
a
white
man,
as
far
as
the
civil
actions
by
white
man
against
another,
but
why
this
legislative
history,
which
i'm
about
to
review
which
i
think
if
i
may
suggest
it
would
help
your
honor
in
this
--
in
this
rather
trying
field.
now,
first,
because
we
have
changed
our
position
from
the
petition
below,
i
would
account
it
below,
i
must
spend
a
moment
on
the
point
that
we
contended
below.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
because
these
traders'
regulation
said
that
the
credit
--
that
extension
of
credit
was
at
the
traders'
own
risk
and
therefore
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
i
--
i
regret
that
our
ally
in
this
case
is
such
a
weak
ally.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
solicitor
should
have
stepped
up
on
this
issue
and
helped
us
backing
our
position.
he
took
this
weak
position,
an
untenable
which
we
had
abandoned.
we
abandoned
it
below
because
we
have
found
when
we
went
to
write
our
brief
in
this
very
case
by
consultation
with
the
attorneys
and
the
department
of
the
interior
that
the
traders
had
affected
their
reaffirmation
of
its
regulation
in
1937
which
did
two
things.
it
took
out
a
provision
that
the
federal
employees
--
it
forbad
--
it
took
out
the
provisions
of
federal
employees
were
forbidden
in
the
indian
bureau,
forbidden
to
help
collect
the
debt.
they
felt
that
they
are
to
be
the
moral
suasion
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
collect
that
debts.
it
did
something
else.
it
took
out
a
prohibition
against
farms
and
pledgets
and
it
put
it
in
that
they
could
put
farms
and
pledgets.
that
gave
the
traders
a
real
grip,
which
they
have
used
extensively,
all
jewelry
and
sheep
and
pinyon
nuts
and
all
sort
of
things
are
pledgets.
furthermore,
and
this
is
the
policy
of
the
solicitor's
opinion.
in
order
to
get
around
this
broad
jurisdictional
point,
and
we
are
aware
of
your
policy
and
judicial
policy
of
trying
to
narrow
its
decision
or
not
to
amend
the
grounds
rather
a
broad
ground.
it
would
be
superficial
and
untenable
to
do
it
upon
the
solicitor's
basis.
he
states
the
blunt
position
that
now,
these
debts
are
unenforceable.
and
for
that
ground
only,
he
says
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
below.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
subject,
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
we
are
happy
to
throw
way
an
untenable
position
even
if
sanctified
by
the
solicitor
general
of
united
states.
and
it
is
untenable.
he
wasn't
aware
of
these
basic
facts.
and
i
asked
permission
of
the
court
to
file
here
just
a
sample
list
of
215
citations
of
cases
pending
in
the
tribal
courts
by
--
by
traders
themselves.
these
debts
are
enforceable
in
the
tribal
courts.
and
they
used
the
tribal
courts
all
the
time.
and
this
is
only
from
three
court
districts.
two
clerks
couldn't
be
reached
and
it
only
is
the
cases
in
the
last
few
months,
hundreds
of
--
of
traders
cases
that
we
went
back
to
the
reaffirmation
of
this
resolution
could
be
--
could
be
showed
to
you.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
this
--
this
court
is
the
law
and
that
therefore
not
foreclosed
of
course,
but
i
would
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
would
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
oh,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
and
i'm
sure
you'll
reach
that
conclusion
because
it
--
it's
--
all
together
incompatible
with
the
language
and
with
the
practice,
the
debts
of
the
traders
are
enforceable.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
oh,
i
think
so,
if
the
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
--
if
the
solicitor
is
right.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
this
is
really
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
here
is
a
telegram
listing
the
cases
that
i
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
submit
to
you
this
list,
your
honor,
on
a
slightly
vague
basis
that
these
are
pending
cases
and
that
the
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
now
pending.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
in
--
in
--
and
--
and
the
cases
that
are
--
that
are
not
very
old.
i
mean,
these
are
cases
now
pending
for
action
in
the
tribal
courts,
and
that
if
i
did
a
thorough
job
of
checking,
i
could
submerge
this
court
with
the
citation
of
cases
since
1937,
since
the
reform
of
this
--
of
this
tribal
regulation
of
this
government
regulation.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i've
been
wrong,
your
honor.
i
regret
that
--
that
it
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
right
now
i've
--
no.
i
--
i
got
it
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
your
honor.
i
had
no
idea
of
the
volume
of
these
cases
frankly
until
i
listened
in
by
telegraph.
we
--
we
submit,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
--
that
the
point
in
the
solicitor's
opinion
that
it's
not
enforceable
is
demolished
by
the
facts
also
by
the
construction
of
the
language
without
reference
to
this
--
the
fact
that
the
traders
do
consequently
enforced
them
in
over
30
years
since
this
reaffirmation
have
done
so.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
well,
it's
quite
a
distinction
in
practice.
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
mean
if
the
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
--
if
the
solicitor
was
right,
your
honor,
in
saying
that
these
were
unenforceable,
then
they
have
no
business
in
the
tribal
courts
and
the
tribal
court
regularly
enforce
them
and
--
and
do
--
and
enter
judgment
and
--
and
moneys
are
paid
and
navajos
pay
and
they
are
collected.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
i
don't
think
he
recognizes
the
tribal
court.
if
he
recognizes
the
tribal
court,
he
can
hardly
say
they
are
enforceable
because
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
right.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
what
we
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
--
that's
what
counsel
for
the
--
for
the
defendant
said
below.
and
we've
abandoned
here
because
of
this
reaffirmation
of
the
regulation
which
makes
it
so
superficial
and
so
tenuous
in
our
position
--
in
our
opinion.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
revived
it
or
he
retreat
to
it,
your
honor,
and
keep
you
off
the
broader
ground.
but
the
--
the
solicitor
says,
to
give
you
his
precise
language,
my
colleague
has
handed
to
me
here,
“the
interior
department,”
reading
page
2
of
his
brief,
“interior
department
we
--
in
--
the
interior
department
and
we
construed
this
provision
as
meaning
that
ordinary
remedies
for
collection
of
debts
including
judicial
remedies
shall
not
be
invoked
within
the
reservation
--
not
period,
but
i
mean
parenthesis,
i
say
period.
and
that
traders
must
do
business
on
that
basis
and
that
understanding.
as
long
--
remedies
are
available
to
reservation,
they
are
used
over
years.
there
are
215
with
a
telegram
overnight.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
he
does.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
he
does
it
over
probably
the
solicitors
in
the
interior
department
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
--
to
the
lawyers,
yes.
yes,
they
coupled.
it
say
“the
interior
department
and
we
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
--
construe
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
i'm
glad
with
your
last
statement
because
i
am
wholly
right.
and
the
depletion
of
the
department
of
the
interior
as
glibly
suggested
in
this
one
line
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
position
they've
taken
on
legislation
which
i
now
wish
to
review
with
you,
completely
inconsistent.
they
have
taken
our
position
time
and
again
and
due
to
this
day
on
legislation
before
congress
and
i
can't
accept
this.
let's
say
this
very
casual
presentation
of
their
point
of
view.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
measure
we're
considering?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it
is
protected,
but
their
construction
of
it
is
not
broad
enough.
it
still
leaves
open
the
door
to
sporadic
raves
under
this
reservation
by
state
jurisdiction
as
in
this
case.
please
have
this
physical
perspective
in
mind
that
if
the
state
has
this
power
to
send
its
processes
into
this
batch
reservation
where
there
are
now
great
reaches
and
discovery
of
oil
and
things
of
that
sort,
lots
of
things
going
on.
it
has
no
correlative
responsibility
to
extend
the
protection
of
its
sheriffs
and
its
courts,
unless
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
is
extended
in
an
orderly
way.
they
can't
sit
back
and
say,
“oh,
we'll
take
this
case.
we'll
go
get
them
on
this
one,”
and
yet
extend
no
sheriff
services
of
that
reservation
of
an
entirely
by
the
navajo
belief
and
no
courts
called
entirely
by
the
tribal
courts.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
your
honor.
i'm
talking
about
--
well,
i'm
talking
about
any
jurisdiction
over
indian
affairs
until
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
have
been
extended
by
congress
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
usual
way
that
they
have
in
the
past
history
of
this
country,
not
by
accretion.
this
is
the
way
the
camel
get
into
the
arab's
tent
by
these
backdoor
methods
and
the
state
should
not
be
permitted
to
intrude
into
--
into
the
jurisdiction
over
these
indian
affairs.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
oh,
i
think
--
i
think
that
too,
your
honor.
the
--
the
questions
are
very
much
appreciated
but
they
--
they
don't
reach
to
that
point.
now,
so
much
for
that
--
that
ground
because
i
would
like
to
consider
that
disposed
of
and
i
hope
the
solicitor's
opinion
have
used
--
modified
to
that
extent.
in
other
words,
i
eliminate
to
my
discussion
now
the
contention
that
we
did
make
below
and
abandoned
here.
and
the
solicitor
picks
up
and
--
and
asserts
that
--
that
the
--
that
is
unenforceable
merely
because
of
this
credit
provision.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
has
withheld
them.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
with
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
with
the
--
with
the
exception
of
one,
your
honor,
with
artful
skill,
he
downgrade
the
most
important
point
in
the
argument
by
dropping
the
--
the
consideration
of
--
of
section
9
of
the
navajo-hopi
rehabilitation
act
to
--
to
a
footnote.
but
let
me
come
to
that
in
--
in
an
orderly
way.
we
now
come
to
the
main
issue
to
the
effect
that
--
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
in
other
words,
our
reasonable
condition
--
our
--
our
contention
throughout,
counsel
of
the
defendants
below
and
here
and
in
the
petition
and
in
our
briefs
throughout
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
of
the
person
because
the
navajo
indians
residing
on
the
navajo
reservation
and
as
much
the
state
does
not
have
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation.
now,
skipping
that
long
line
of
cases
from
worcester
against
georgia
to
which
i
referred,
john
marshall,
right
on
down
through
the
decision
of
this
court,
skipping
that
base
which
is
adequately
set
forth
in
the
briefs
by
looking
at
the
legislation,
congress
has
carefully
maintained
the
jurisdiction
from
the
day,
your
honor,
when
we
start
from
the
sovereign
character
of
the
indian
nation,
incredible
as
it
seems
today.
it
was
true
with
all
of
the
immunities
that
are
attached
thereto
or
--
or
most
of
them.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it
is.
and
congress
has
step
by
step
stepped
down
from
that
partialling
out
the
jurisdiction
by
expressed
provisions.
now,
coming
up
to
date
on
it,
the
new
york
statute
of
1948,
except
for
hunting
and
fishing
which
was
preserved
in
its
--
in
its
indian
right
preserved
from
their
reservoir
granted
a
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations
in
the
state
of
new
york.
that
was
amended
in
1950
to
extend
it
to
criminal
jurisdiction
so
that
the
courts
of
new
york
then
had
jurisdiction
over
all
of
this.
in
1953,
there
was
the
general
--
a
general
act
extending
specifically
to
five
states,
minnesota,
nebraska,
oregon,
wisconsin
and
california
extending
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
of
those
states
over
indian
reservations
within
those
states
over
an
indian
country.
now,
section
6
and
7
of
that
act
is
pertinent
to
our
case
because
section
6
and
7
said
that
consent
is
given
to
the
people
of
any
state
to
amend
the
constitution
or
statutes
to
remove
impediment
to
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction.
this
impediment
exists
in
arizona
in
the
constitution.
it
is
submitted
in
the
union
under
condition
as
quoted
in
our
brief
that
as
long
as
the
federal
government
maintains
this
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
these
lands
--
these
lands
until
they
release
from
indian
title
or
absolute
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government.
they
have
the
power.
they
have
the
power
to
get
the
jurisdiction
which
they're
reaching
for
sporadically
in
this
one
case,
under
6
--
section
6
and
7.
so
that
anytime
the
people
of
arizona
want
the
jurisdiction
which
is
artificially
and
unnaturally
contended
for
here,
they
can
get
it
by
the
legislative
process
by
amending
their
constitution
and
amending
their
prohibition
statutes,
and
they
have
it
under
consideration.
out
of
chronology,
i
now
mention
in
the
navajo-hopi
rehabilitation
act,
passed
in
1949
to
design
to
accomplish
the
rehabilitation
of
these
two
tribes
of
which
section
9
was
added
in
1949
to
provide
in
all
cases
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
and
the
federal
and
tribal
court
shall
become
current.
that
was
vetoed
by
president
truman.
and
the
act
was
passed
in
the
next
congress
without
it.
so
here
is
a
clear
legislative
history.
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
is
not
extended
even
concurrently.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
what
i
meant.
i'm
sorry.
yes.
i
meant
without
section
9,
your
honor.
so
that
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
yes,
definitely.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
oh,
definitely.
oh,
no.
no
question
about
it,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
be
here.
it
would
be
all
settled.
it's
--
and
the
reasons
for
the
president's
veto
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
especially,
i
referred
to
again
in
our
--
in
our
reply.
now,
in
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
miller
against
begay
which
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
this
present
opinion
which
we
are
reviewing,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
the
same
court
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
a
suit
by
your
wife
of
a
divorce
--
in
a
divorce
affair
who'd
been
married
under
arizona
law,
under
arizona
license,
divorced
from
the
tribal
court,
the
wife
being
unhappy,
sued,
went
back
to
the
arizona
court,
she's
unhappy
about
the
tribal
decision
on
alimony
--
that's
by
the
different
concepts
of
those
things.
and
she
sued
in
the
state
court
and
the
same
court.
chief
justice
--
chief
justice
udall
held
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
precisely
in
point
with
this
case
and
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
present
holding
that
this
hugh
lee
can
maintain
this
jurisdiction.
now,
i
find
fault
with
my
distinguished
ally,
the
solicitor
in
retiring
to
a
footnote.
they
all
submit
they
can
point
at
section
9
of
the
navajo-hopi
act
was
dropped
after
the
president's
veto,
which
hits
right
in
the
middle
of
this
case
and
not
to
our
court
on
the
broad
grounds
and
not
the
narrow
grounds
and
he
should
have
said
so.
now,
he
speaks
in
his
brief
of
the
reserve
powers
of
the
state.
what
reserve
powers?
are
the
reserve
powers
whose
date
over
piece
in
ore,
over
foreign
affairs
or
indian
affairs?
no.
the
only
reserve
powers
i
know
that
are
left
to
the
states
and
these
delegations
of
power
to
the
federal
government
are
in
the
articles
of
confederation.
i
admit
there's
one
there.
the
article
of
confederation
giving
the
power
of
peace
and
war
reserved
the
power
to
the
state
to
make
war
on
indian
tribes
that
threatened
with
invasion.
well,
of
course,
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
--
that
the
article
of
confederation
are
no
longer
in
full
force
and
effect.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
[laughs]but
that
was
the
only
legal
example
that
i
could
find.
i
don't
know
what
the
solicitor
is
talking
about
reserve
powers
of
the
state.
are
we
trying
to
change
the
philosophy
of
constitutional
law?
the
only
thing
he
can
refer
to
properly
are
the
incidental
powers
of
the
state
sustained
by
this
court
in
many
decisions,
criminal
jurisdiction
over
the
white
men
for
crimes
on
the
reservation,
similar
jurisdiction
as
far
as
the
white
man's
conducts
are
concerned,
jurisdiction
over
tax
cases.
the
state
is
not
negative
in
its
proper
jurisdiction
but
over
indians
on
the
reservation
it
out
until
this
legislation
in
arizona
is
passed
pursuant
to
section
6
--
articles
--
sections
6
and
7
of
the
--
of
the
act
of
1953.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
it
disposes
conclusively
of
the
narrow
contention
upon
which
the
solicitor's
opinion
is
based,
it's
in
the
solicitor's
brief,
it's
based
amicus
that
these
debts
are
unenforceable.
it's
merely
to
show
that
they
are
enforceable.
he
takes
one
construction
of
this
cfr
regulations
which
let's
read
for
the
moment,
it's
only
a
line
that
trader
may
extend
credit
to
indians
but
credit
will
be
at
the
traders'
own
risk.
now,
he's
joins
with
us
in
saying
that
the
court
below
lacked
jurisdiction
on
the
narrow
ground
under
that
language,
the
debt
is
unenforceable.
i
say
it
is
enforceable
in
the
tribal
court.
we're
engaged
in
no
unholy
conspiracy,
your
honor,
to
get
a
broad
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
your
honor,
it's
the
line
in
your
thalweg.
we
are
not
seeking
and
if
we
had
a
narrow
ground,
we
would
go
for
it.
we
want
to
win
this
case
to
begin
with.
we
went
for
in
the
petition
and
it
was
only
on
the
revelation
of
the
history
of
this
regulation
and
its
weakness
that
i,
an
associate
counsel,
could
not
conscientiously
come
before
this
court
as
practitioners
who
hope
to
come
again
someday
and
makes
so
tenuous
and
superficial
the
contentions
that
these
--
that
these
debts
are
therefore
unenforceable
so
we
drop
this
point.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
i
will
do
my
best
in
the
case,
the
next
bar
association.[laughter]
i
have
never
made
a
contention
here
which
i
felt
was
not
tenable
and
my
colleague
--
associate
in
this
case
has
not
either
and
i
think
this
is
an
untenable
one.
and
i
think
we
have
demolished
it.
i
think
this
--
the
showing
of
these
cases
is
a
--
is
superficial,
if
you
please,
your
honor,
i
--
in
the
surface,
250,
it's
quite
as
skimming
though
to
show
that
these
debts
are
enforced.
the
solicitor
is
wrong
about
it.
now,
that
is
our
only
ground,
sir,
for
--
for
saying
that
this
case
should
be
properly
launched
in
the
stream
of
magnificent
cases
holding
to
the
same
effect
that
we're
condemning
for
by
this
court.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
person
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner
on
the
fact
of
this
case,
precisely
that's
the
point.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
whole
point.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
now,
thank
you
for
asking
that
because
i
just
wanted
to
come
to
that
which
i
can
see
and
very
recently
abolish,
your
honor
--
honor,
considerably.
two
or
three
times
i've
quickly
put
my
hand
on
two
times
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings.
it
was
stipulated
by
counsel
that
everything
here
would
be
without
prejudice
as
my
able
colleagues
from
arizona
has
agreed
and
his
signatures
here
so
he
must
of
course.
i
won't
bother
you
to
read
those
but,
your
honors,
bothered
by
the
effect
of
them.
i
say
that
this
is
a
procedural
matter
for
the
courts
of
arizona.
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
has
sustained
this
without
waiver
of
jurisdiction
that
we
could
proceed
in
this
case
without
waiving
the
jurisdiction
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
could
say
that's
a
procedural
point
and
not
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
it's
for
the
law
of
the
court
in
the
state
of
arizona.
and
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
has
spoken
on
it
and
--
and
said
yes
that
our
waivers
of
--
of
the
--
why
counsel
below
would
have,
in
this
case
for
a
minute,
accepted
those
stipulations
protected
by
the
decrees
of
that
court
all
the
way
through
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
arizona.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
questioned
here.
it's
a
new
--
it's
a
new
issue.
respectively
submitted
it,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
i
--
i
do
if
i
--
if
my
answer
to
judge
--
justice
whittaker
was
construed
that
way,
i
--
i
quite
agree
for
this
lawsuit
and
it's
for
any
similar
situation.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
precisely.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
was
tempted
to
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
correct.
i
--
i
was
--
well,
jurisdiction
of
the
indian
too.
but
i
wasn't
--
i
would
tend
to
put
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
quite
right,
quite
right.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
you
see,
you're
both
right
[laughter].
mr.
norman
m.
littell
and
--
and
may
i
--
[laughter]
mr.
norman
m.
littell
and
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
throw
myself
on
the
mercy
of
the
chief
justice
and
have
this
question
resolved
in
chamber?[laughter]
mr.
norman
m.
littell
now,
very
quickly
because
my
time
is
going
--
is
almost
gone.
my
distinguished
opponent
from
arizona
has
his
shoe
on
the
wrong
foot.
the
power
of
the
federal
government
is
plenary,
our
state,
not
over
these
indian
affairs.and
we
so
contend.
now,
his
attempt
to
--
his
attempt
to
confine
this
language
that
the
constitution,
taken
over
from
the
enabling
act
of
arizona,
to
effect
on
lands
is
a
strange
and
unnatural
concept
which
out
of
court
with
this
court's
decisions.
reading
from
page
25,
appendix
a
of
our
brief
that
people
inhabiting
this
state
do
agree
and
declare
that
they
forever
disclaim
all
rights
entitled
to
the
unappropriated
and
ungranted
public
lands
lying
within
the
boundaries
thereof
and
to
all
lands
lying
within
said
boundaries
own
or
held
by
any
indian
or
indian
tribes
the
right
or
title
to
which
shall
be
--
shall
have
been
acquired
through
or
from
the
united
states
or
any
prior
sovereignty.
and
that,
here
it
is,
“until
the
title
of
such
indian
or
indian
tribe
shall
have
been
extinguished,
the
same
shall
be
and
remain
subject
to
the
disposition
under
the
absolute
disposition
and
control
of
the
united
states.”
now,
if
counsel's
petition
was
correct,
why,
section
9
of
the
hopi
act
which
was
vetoed
by
president
truman
extending
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction,
why,
section
6
and
7
of
the
act
of
1953
extending
jurisdiction
to
five
states
very
discriminatingly,
you
read
the
act,
you'll
find
they
eliminated
two
tribes.
they
concluded
--
congress
concluded
two
tribes
weren't
ready
for
this.
two
tribes
were
eliminated
but
otherwise
for
those
five
states,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
is
extended,
why,
section
6
or
7
inviting
the
state
of
arizona
to
come
in
through
its
legislature
and
to
its
people
and
amend
its
constitution
and
delete
this.
it's
an
open
invitation
because
congress
realizes
that
this
is
not
a
thing
which
can
be
handled
by
sporadic
grabbing
of
jurisdiction
as
in
this
case
because
it
does
not
carry
with
it
this
sporadic
grabbing
of
jurisdiction
and
this
case
does
not
carry
with
it
the
extension
of
the
concomitant
civil
services
that
go
with
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction.
how
about
courts?
how
about
the
police?
over
24,000
square
miles
is
big
as
all
of
virginia,
is
big
as
all
of
new
england
except
maine.
do
they
just
reach
in
and
grab
for
jurisdiction
when
they
want
it?that's
what
counsel
is
contending
for
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
could
--
could
i
take
the
extreme
and
on
terrible
liberty
of
adding
just
this
to
this
point?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
cites
the
draper
case.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
he
--
he
cites
the
draper
case.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
with
this
point,
he
cites
the
draper
in
support
of
this
extraordinary
doctrine
that
this
doesn't
apply
to
lands
only
--
it
only
applies
to
lands
and
not
to
persons.
what
is
jurisdiction
--
but
over
persons
on
the
lands.
what
is
the
jurisdiction
except
that?
the
draper
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
case.
the
draper
case
was
a
clear
holding
that
a
murder
by
a
white
man,
a
non-indian
on
the
indian
reservation
could
be
punished
in
the
state
courts.
we
admit
it.
we
admit
they
can
be
so
protected.
we
admit
they
can
sue
each
other
for
other
things.
that's
my
point.
it
does
sustain
this
--
this
case
at
all.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
unless
there
were
what?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
did.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
within
the
--
well,
my
associate
suggests
specific
regulations.
i
was
going
to
make
the
general
answer
but
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
specific
regulation
is
--
is
in
the
--
in
25
cfr
--
the
regulations
based
upon
statute
25
cfr
11.22.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no.
that's
the
trading
regulation.
this
is
court
regulation.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
this
is
in
--
this
is
in
the
regulations,
your
honor,
pertaining
to
the
tribal
courts
and
let
me
read
the
first
line
of
it.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
“the
courts
of
the
indian
offenses
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
all
suits
wherein
the
defendant
is
a
member
of
tribe
or
tribes
within
their
jurisdiction.”
mr.
norman
m.
littell
court
--
the
court
of
indian
offenses,
yes
sir.
it's
--
that's
a
regular
known
name
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
there
are
these
tribal
courts
all
over
the
country.
and
in
indian
reservations,
they
have
these
tribal
courts
and
these
are
the
regulations
that
--
that
control.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
perhaps
we
should
have
cited.
i
cite
it
now.
here
it
is,
that
leads
you
to
all
these
regulations.
i
don't
believe
we've
cited
the
tribal
court
regulation
because
we
did
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes
--
yes,
your
honor,
25
cfr
11.22
jurisdiction.
and
there's
some
change
in
numbering
from
our
original
--
no
disregard
that.
that
will
only
confuse.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
oh,
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
this
--
no.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
sir.
you'll
find
this
in
the
--
in
your
own
library
this
way.
and
that's
an
official
government
publication.
and
it
has
--
these
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
as
you
know.
i
merely
cited
that
to
demolish
the
point
that
--
that
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
oh,
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
it's
a
--
it's
a
separate
--
it's
a
separate
judicial
system.
i
--
i
can't
--
except
outside
of
the
record
begin
to
expound
on
it
how
we're
trying
to
improve
tribal
courts
from
the
navajo
reservation
but
it
has
very
mark
limitations.
however,
i
point
to
the
fact
that
the
traders
for
years
had
(inaudible)
to
collect
their
debts.and
their
judgments
are
entered
then
the
navajos
pay.
it's
not
as
precise
and
as
formal
and
as
satisfactorily
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
sir?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
judges
are
now
elected
in
the
navajo
reservation.
it's
different
in
different
reservation.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
and
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
have
--
that's
the
theory.
they
have
the
cognizance
of
tribal
customs
as
they
probably
will
amend
the
--
the
tribal
regulations
to
make
an
appointee.
they
have
the
same
experience
with
elected
judges
that
we've
had.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
completely.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
complete
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
among
themselves
and
others
using
too.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
why,
sir,
the
general
plenary
power
of
the
--
of
the
government
under
the
constitution
over
indians.
this
is
only
one
of
the
aspects.
this
scope
is
available
to
regulations
and
things
of
indians,
an
exercise
of
the
plenary
power
of
the
constitution.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it's
--
it's
--
in
--
i'm
sure
that
there
is
statutory
authority
which
i
can't
cite
at
the
moment
behind
these,
your
honor,
this
--
this
collateral
line
that
comes
up
a
little
unexpectedly
but
i
have
to
say
the
answer
is
yes
anyway
because
the
portion
affected
these
regulations
and
--
and
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
answer
is
yes
that
they
have
the
power
whether
there's
a
statute
behind
it
or
not
under
the
general
delegation
of
the
power
to
the
--
to
the
secretary
to
regulate
indians.
but
that
power
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
well,
sir,
i
was
thinking
of
the
constitution.
but
--
but
i
do
believe
that
there
--
there
are
powers.
if
i
may
just
make
this
one
more
point
--
i
see
our
time
is
exhausted
and
there
is
no
need
to
asking
more.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
will
spare
the
court
but
only
call
your
attention.
if
i'm
wrong
about
these
things,
about
section
9,
about
6
--
section
6
and
7
of
the
act
of
1953,
why
did
congress
also
go
on
the
admission
of
alaska
and
extend
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction?
it's
always
by
statute
and
it
can't
be
gotten
like
camel
get
into
the
arab's
tent,
the
way
they're
trying
to
get
it
here.
