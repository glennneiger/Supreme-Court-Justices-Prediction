justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
littell,
may
i
ask
if
there
were
a
transaction
off
the
reservation,
might
there
be
service
upon
the
indian
on
the
reservation
in
respect
of
that
transaction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
merely
because
he's
on
the
reservation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
here,
we
have
a
transaction
on
the
reservation
and
the
indian
on
the
reservation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
legislative
districts
or
county
units
exclusively
within
the
bounds
of
the
--
of
the
reservation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
they
have
the
right
to
vote
in
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
county
lines
are
not
coextensive
with
or
entirely
within
the
reservation
as
such?
it
is
24,000
square
miles,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
put
on
jurisdictional
ground.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
the
basis
upon
which
your
supreme
court
said,
“your
state
court
has
no
jurisdiction”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
or
something
like
that.
it's
something
like
that.
i
don't
--
as
i
understood
it,
i
haven't
read
the
opinion,
but
as
i
understood
it,
this
was
grounded
on
complete
absence
of
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts,
for
example,
as
if
these
parties
would
first
come
to
the
state
courts
for
a
divorce
without
having
been
to
the
tribal
court,
as
i
understood
it,
your
supreme
court
affects
that
that
there
would
have
been
no
jurisdiction
entertained,
if
that's
the
(inaudible),
am
i
right
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
wrong
in
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
--
in
other
words
the
decision
was
influenced
by
the
facts
that
there
are
--
had
already
been
a
divorce
proceeding
in
the
tribal
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
have
difficulty
understanding
how
that
bears
on
jurisdictions
of
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
was
that
on
some
notion
then
of
a
concurrent
jurisdiction,
one
court
having
taken
jurisdiction,
the
other
one
would
not
interfere
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
this
way.
suppose
it
never
been
a
tribal
court
proceeding,
would
it
be,
in
arizona,
possible
for
those
parties
to
have
--
had
an
action
to
determine
--
divorce
action
determined
in
your
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
not
done
on
any
expressed
grant
by
congress
to
your
state
court
to
entertain
that
kind
of
action
between
the
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
any
expressed
grant
of
congress--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
arizona
court
entertain
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what's
the
basis
upon
which
the
state
court
says
they
have
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
basis
really
would
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
very
argument
you're
giving
us
to
sustain
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
mr.
stevenson
(inaudible)
your
supreme
court
recognized
that
as
guardian
of
the
indians,
the
government
could
effectively
withdraw
property
of
the
indians
of
this
kind
in
any
event
from
vulnerability
to
attachment
or
other
disposition,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
has
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
have
in
many
state
laws,
including
my
own
state,
property
exempt
from
attachment
or
execution
up
to
$100
or
$200
if
it
consists
of
household
furniture
or
clothing
and
that
sort
of
thing.
this
is
much
different,
is
it
really?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
littell,
are
you
--
when
you
agreed
that
there's
nothing
here
for
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
person,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
i
had
the
feeling
that
this
was
a
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
of
this
lawsuit,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
this
lawsuit
which
involves
an
indian
defendant
against
whom
is
sought
to
be
enforced
the
claim
arising
out
of
a
transaction
on
the
indian
reservation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
lawsuit,
not
of
the
indian.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
basically
it's
lawsuit,
not
personal
jurisdiction
you
pointed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
those
regulations
published
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
looks
like
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
they're
published
but
is
that
the
way
we
get
them
and
the
volume
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
--
who
appoints
the
judges?
