mr.
louis
c.
wyman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
am
very
happy
and
grateful
to
have
the
opportunity
at
this
time
to
be
able
to
argue
this
case,
because
particularly
of
the
argument
that
has
been
made
to
date
in
respect
to
the
meaning
and
significance
of
some
of
these
earlier
decisions.
it
is
been
said
here
that
we're
out
of
business
in
new
hampshire
as
a
state
investigation
of
subversive
activities
because
of
the
steve
nelson
decision
and
the
sweezy
case.
i
don't
believe,
most
respectfully,
that
this
court
has
ever
held
that
to
be
the
law.but
at
this
point,
this
is
a
very
simple
case.
what
is
before
the
court
here
is
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
willard
uphaus
asking
him
to
produce
two
things
which
he
refuses
to
produce.
not
for
the
reason
of
the
fifth
amendment.
not
for
reason
of
any
claim
at
all,
except
as
he
says,
for
reason
of
conscience
and
for
technical
reasons
assigned
by
counsel,
first
amendment,
fourth
amendment,
sixth
amendment
and
so
forth.
no
fifth
amendment.
now,
what
was
he
called
for?
the
first
thing
was
his
guest
list
at
world
fellowship
incorporated,
which
is
a
summer
camp
in
new
hampshire
to
which
people
come
from
many
parts
of
the
united
states
and
concerning
which
considerable
facts
were
unavoidably
set
forth
to
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
in
a
required
report
which
was
submitted
to
the
general
court
on
january
5th,
1955.
in
his
argument
just
now,
mr.
france
just
said
that
he'd
like
to
have
this
report
in
the
record
printed
as
an
appendix
to
their
reply
brief
is
a
statement
that
they
don't
consent
to
it,
but
will
raise
no
formal
objection
because
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
consent
to
it.
we
brought
40
copies
here
with
us
simply
for
the
reason
that
we
believe
that
it
is
impossible
to
adequately
assess
the
full
record
of
this
case
and
to
determine
whether
the
questions
that
are
asked
of
dr.
uphaus
in
which
he
declines
to
answer
in
this
case
are
relevant
without
examining
this
report
which
antedates
the
proceeding
which
is
now
before
this
honorable
court.
i
would
like
to
the
second
class
of
information
that's
asked
for
here
by
the
subpoenas
is
for
correspondence
between
uphaus
and
speakers
who
came
to
world
fellowship.
on
this
--
without
going
into
the
page
references
in
the
record,
there
were
some
20
speakers
with
whom
he
had
correspondence
and
that
correspondence
is
in
existence.
it
is
in
new
haven,
connecticut
and
the
guest
registers
which
are
asked
for
by
the
subpoena
are
in
existence
for
the
two
years,
not
forever,
but
just
for
1954
and
1955.
they're
in
existence
on
355
(inaudible)
in
new
haven,
connecticut
and
there
were
about
300
or
maybe
400
guests
in
each
of
the
two
years.
that's
all
that
this
case
is
about.
now,
as
against
the
request
of
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire,
not
of
the
attorney
general,
this
is
a
legislative
committee
of
one
which
has
been
approved
as
a
procedure
and
practice
in
my
state.
and
as
to
which
this
court
held
of
such
approval
to
be
binding
and
of
no
concern
here.
this
committee
was
the
attorney
general
for
the
general
court
because
they
didn't
want
a
committee
of
politicians
to
be
conducting
this
kind
of
investigation
in
new
hampshire.
and
this
committee
has
operated
in
this
case
as
in
all
other
cases
under
rules
of
procedure
which
are
printed
up
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
and
which
are
ultimately
fair,
which
were
approved
in
substance
by
the
house
of
delegates
of
the
american
bar
association
and
has
at
all
times
good
witnesses
in
executive
session
including
dr.
uphaus.
that
executive
session
incidentally
consisted
of
having
the
witness
and
this
counsel
come
into
one
room,
a
private
room
without
anybody
being
there
at
all
except
possibly
myself
or
one
or
two
assistant
attorneys
general
or
a
--
an
investigator,
the
witness
and
this
counsel.
and
if
the
transcripts
which
are
printed,
some
of
which
are
printed
in
the
transcript
of
record
in
this
case,
are
examined
by
this
court,
i
am
sure
that
you
will
find
that
at
all
times
the
exchanges
between
counsel
and
the
witness
and
the
committee
were
both
courteous
and
restrained.
so
that
at
this
time,
what
does
this
case
involve
for
this
court
as
an
issue
as
the
fundamental
gravamen
to
use
dr.
france's
language.
the
gravamen
of
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
the
language
of
the
new
hampshire's
subversive
activities
law
of
1951,
chapter
588
of
our
rsa
and
the
basic
policy
of
the
new
hampshire
law.
he
may
not
publish
it
unless
it
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
in
his
opinion.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
in
his
unfettered
opinion
but
the
publication
comes
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
first,
in
new
hampshire
in
respect
to
certain
witnesses
who
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
then,
only,
in
respect
to
those
aspects
of
their
testimony
which
might
elicit
further
additional
information
as
to
whether
what
they
refuse
to
talk
about
was
known
to
anybody
else
in
new
hampshire.
and
second,
in
a
report
from
the
general
court
of
new
hampshire,
which
is
required
to
be
made,
with
respect
to
recommendations
for
legislation
in
this
field
and
from
which
two
separate
laws
were
passed
in
new
hampshire,
in
1955.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no
sir.
that's
the
only
written
report
that's
ever
been
submitted
by
me.
the
--
i
like
to
say
also
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
sir.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
just
a
report.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
what
i
have.
what
i
have
here
is
not
the
full
report.
what
i
have
here
is
offset
reproduction
of
only
those
sections
of
the
report
that
deal
with
world
fellowship
and
willard
uphaus.
the
full
report
is
three
or
four
times
this
size.
and
at
this
time,
if
it's
of
any
significance,
i
would
like
to
say
that
90%
of
the
names
of
witnesses
that
were
--
that
testified
in
the
executive
session
in
the
investigation
of
subversive
activities
in
new
hampshire
had
never
been
published.
they
did
not
appear
in
this
report
and
it
is
then
our
policy
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
procedures
not
to
do
that
whenever
we
can
avoid
it.
but
we
do
have
this
statute
in
new
hampshire
which
requires
that
when
a
witness
declines
to
answer,
that
the
committee
can
do
nothing
about
it
and
they
must
transfer
the
matter
to
the
court.
and
then,
before
the
court
they
have
a
full
hearing,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
questions
are
relevant.
whether
or
not
the
--
the
statute
under
which
the
questions
of
course
is
constitutional.
and
after
the
court
makes
that
determination
one
way
or
the
other,
the
case
is
decided
under
the
aegis
of
the
judiciary.
i
think
it's
of
some
importance
to
mention
the
fact
about
names
because
the
implication
of
the
argument
in
appellant's
brief
is
that
if
the
names
of
the
guests
are
produced
in
accordance
with
the
subpoena,
that
we
will
immediately
proceed
to
the
report
under
the
legislature
of
subversive
persons.
which
i
assure
to
you,
on
my
professional
word,
will
not
be
done.
we
do
feel,
however,
that
the
guest
names
have
some
relevance
that
there
may
have
been
many
of
them
who
were
or
are
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
that
in
any
fact
finding
investigation,
that
it
is
our
responsibility
and
duty
in
order
to
try
to
find
out
whether
there
was
advocacy
of
violent
overthrow
or
that
kind
of
incitement
to
action
referred
to
as
a
limitation
under
the
smith
act
and
hence,
applicable
to
that
aspect
of
the
new
hampshire's
--
the
subversive
activities
act
by
yates
versus
u.s.
held
by
this
court
whether
that
existed
at
world
fellowship.
you
see,
there
are
two
things
here
that
are
really
the
job
of
the
committee.
one,
is
willard
uphaus
a
subversive
person?
that's
one.
the
second
is,
and
this
is
perhaps
more
important,
is
world
fellowship
incorporated
a
bona
fide
place
in
which
people
come
for
the
purposes
of
dissent
and
argument,
and
discussion
of
controversial
matters
all
within
the
limitations
of
freedom
of
speech?
or,
is
it
a
place
where
they
come
to
hatch
a
plot
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire?
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
in
new
hampshire
as
a
voluntary
corporation,
your
honor.
that
is
the
thing
that
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor.
i
have
never
said
and
i
do
not
now
urge
and
argue
in
this
court
that
a
communist
is
not
entitled
to
all
of
the
rights
which
any
american
citizen
or
a
person
in
this
country
is
entitled
to.
a
philosophical
communist
is
a
species
of
individual
as
to
whose
actual
philosophy,
i
am
in
doubt.
do
you
mean
i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
what
--
by
that
whether
he
advocates
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes
i
did,
your
honor.
i
was
intensely
critical
of
some
of
the
decisions.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
i
think
a
part
of
the
grip
in
my
argument
today
and
the
feeling
that
i
have
then
was
that
as
things
now
stand,
all
the
witness
has
to
do
today
to
avoid
a
contempt
charge
is
to
refuse
to
answer
and
cite
sweezy
and
watkins
and
perhaps
yates
and
we're
in
doubt.
we
don't
know
whether
he
has
to
answer
or
not.
now,
we
feel
that
the
watkins
case
in
this
particular
cause
which
is
here
is
inapplicable,
because
we
don't
think
we
have
a
vague
resolution.
we
think
that
this
court
in
effect
in
watkins
told
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
"rewrite
your
resolution
empowering
your
un-american
activities
and
your
internal
security
subcommittee,
empowering
them
to
act.
rewrite
it
so
that
we'll
know
and
can
pass
as
a
judicial
act
upon
what
un-american
activities
means.
or,
we
will
be
unable
to
determine
whether
a
particular
question
is
relevant
to
the
line
of
inquiry
which
you
are
now
taking.‚Äù
but
in
new
hampshire,
we
have
an
act
which
was
very
carefully
written
by
a
frank
ober
of
the
maryland
bar
and
has
been
patterned
in
the
many
states
in
this
country
known
as
the
ober
act,
in
which
subversive
activity
is
defined
very
clearly
to
require
a
scienter
with
intentional
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
by
force
and
violence.
and
to
require
of
an
organization
before
it
can
be
held
to
be
subversive
that
it
shall
have
and
be
found
to
have
as
one
of
its
purposes,
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof
by
force
and
violence.
and
i
say
the
state
because
as
we
see
it
in
the
steve
nelson
decision
of
that
portion
of
the
new
hampshire
law
which
said
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
that
portion
which
dealt
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
been
struck
out
insofar
at
least
as
the
capacity
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
to
constitute
this
concern.
we
don't
believe
that
this
court
struck
out
from
the
statute,
that
section
of
--
of
the
statute
which
said
that
new
hampshire
may
make
it
a
crime
to
conspire
or
to
advocate
or
to
teach
the
propriety
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
within
its
borders.
and
there,
perhaps
raises
the
question
and
a
very
important
one,
what
happens
when
someone
takes
the
position
that
the
web
and
fabric
of
the
statutory
restrictions
on
this
type
of
activity
are
all
directed
at
the
international
communist
movement.
what
happens
when
the
--
when
it
is
said
that
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
unavoidably
involves,
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
(inaudible)
in
california,
and
there,
we
cannot
answer
that
except
to
say
that
we
hope
that
this
court
will
read
carefully
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire.
in
this
case,
where
it
said
we're
concerned
and
we
find
the
legislature's
concern
is
valid
about
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
we
believe
that
it
cannot
be
found
that
the
legislature
did
not
have
a
genuine
concern
to
know
whether
there
were
people
at
world
fellowship,
inc.
that
were
conspiring
to
overthrow
the
government
of
new
hampshire.
and
hence,
the
investigation
appears
to
be
warranted.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
your
honor,
when
i
was
first
empowered
with
the
obligation
of
conducting
this
investigation
for
the
legislature
in
1953
in
new
hampshire,
i
came
to
washington
to
study
the
rules
that
applied
to
the
various
committees
that
had
been
in
this
field
at
that
time
in
washington.
and
to
try
and
put
together
from
them
a
composite
which
would
come
as
close
to
settling
the
arguments
that
were
made
of
unfairness
that
i
could
find
and
still
not
completely
incapacitate
the
committee's
informing
function.
it
was
an
ad
hoc
combination
of
those
things
for
the
purposes
of
the
new
hampshire
investigation.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
sense
that
they
have
received
and
accepted
the
report,
twice
extended
the
investigation
and
now
made
the
investigation
a
permanent
part
of
the
permanent
legislation
of
new
hampshire,
not
as
a
permanent
investigation,
but
by
providing
that
whenever
the
attorney
general
has
any
evidence
coming
to
him
of
any
responsible
source,
and
again,
i
am
unable
to
say
that
it
is
required
to
come
to
the
general
court.
it
comes
to
the
attorney
general
that
he
shall
have
the
power
to
investigate.
and
if
he
believes
legislation
to
be
required,
he
shall
make
his
report
to
the
legislature
at
that
time.
that's
the
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
in
this
field
only.
yes,
your
honor.
a
reading
--
many
law
review
articles
and
many
cases
which
have
dealt
with
the
whole
--
the
question
of
issues
in
this
case
and
the
application
of
the
first
amendment
and
before
i
spend
my
concluding
moments
of
argument
upon
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
we
believe
to
be
very
important,
i
want
to
refer
to
two
or
three
things
which
seems
to
me
are
basic.
first,
that
the
communist
party
is
not
a
lawful
political
party,
nor
is
it
an
ordinary
political
party
as
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party
in
america.
if
it
is
to
be
considered
as
that,
as
an
ordinary
political
party,
then,
i
think
that
the
entire
tenor
of
the
disposition
of
this
matter
has
got
to
take
a
different
tone.
we
don't
believe
any
responsible
source
whether
in
or
out
of
government
has
ever
found
in
this
country
that
the
communist
party
was
anything
other
than
a
conspiracy.
one
of
the
objects
of
which
was
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america,
and
in
part,
the
governments
of
all
the
various
states
of
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
1946,
i
believe
was
the
last
year,
your
honor,
that
the
communist
party
was
on
the
ticket
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
since
1951,
which
was
the
year
that
they
first
passed
the
subversive
activities
law
in
new
hampshire,
no
one
admits
to
being
a
communist
in
my
state.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
sir.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
it
could
lawfully
appear
on
the
ballot,
although
it
is
very
plain
from
the
preamble
to
the
act
in
new
hampshire
of
1951,
the
subversive
activities
law
that
what
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
had
in
mind
was
the
communist
party
rather
than
fascism
but
it
is
so
worded
that
if
fascism
or
any
others
that
denied
the
constitutional
freedoms
whether
--
be
involved
in
a
party
that
it
would
be
subject
to
the
sanctions
of
our
act.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh,
i
would
believe
it
to
be
absolutely
imperative.
if
gerald
l.
k.
smith
came
into
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
i'd
want
to
know
what
he
was
doing,
you
honor.
and
i
would
believe
that
the
statute
required
me
to
find
out,
at
least
to
ask
him,
whether
or
not
he
was
advocating
any
of
the
doctrines
for
which
he
has
so
infamous
in
america.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
it
depends
upon
whether
i
have
something
in
my
possession
which
was
in
the
nature
of
probable
cause.
i
would
say
that
out
of
the
blue,
no.
not
to
subpoena
all
of
his
correspondence.
but,
if
i
had
in
the
possession
of
the
staff
of
the
committee
a
--
an
indication
that
he
had
within
new
hampshire,
been
active
in
many
organizations,
infiltrated
or
controlled
by
communists
or
fascist,
then
i
would
say
if
he
had
ran
an
organization
in
my
state
or
was
heading
it
up
and
he'
ask
people
to
come
there
and
speak
and
one
of
the
things
i
was
required
to
find
out
was
whether
there
had
been
advocacy
of
overthrow
of
it's
government
by
force
and
violence
that
i
would
be
required
to
ask
for
his
correspondence
with
them.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
it
would
depend,
your
honor
in
my
opinion,
and
i'm
sorry
to
have
to
answer
it
this
way
as
to
what
activity
he
had
had
within
my
state.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
chose
him
‚Äì-
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
(inaudible)
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
if
he
had
gatherings
within
my
state,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
i
would,
your
honor
provided
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
if
people
were
invited
to
come
there
and
speak,
the
people
in
new
hampshire,
yes.
provided
i
have
in
addition,
indication
that
those
people
had
been
active
in
organizations
which
somebody
thought
were
controlled
by
subversives.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor.
it
would
not.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
my
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
my
decision
is
always
under
our
procedure
in
new
hampshire
subject
to
review
by
the
court
upon
a
record
which
in
turn
is
subject
to
review
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
within
certain
limits,
my
discretion
is
used
but
as
has
been
held
in
new
hampshire,
that
discretion
must
be
supported
by
something
in
the
nature
of
some
legitimate
and
reasonable
reason
for
concluding,
as
i
have,
that
there
was
a
necessity
to
obtain
the
information.
i
could
not
for
example
out
of
thin
air
take
the
case
of
john
jones
and
ask
john
jones
without
anything
more
for
his
correspondence
or
inquire
into
his
private
life.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
your
honor,
you
have
said,
made
a
report
that
people
were
known
to
have
bad
character.
i
have
never
characterized
anyone
in
any
reports
submitted
to
the
legislature
as
being
subversive
person.
i
have
never
so
characterized
willard
uphaus
and
i
made
it
very
clear
on
repeated
occasions.
i
have
reported
the
obviously
known
facts
of
association
on
membership
and
organizations
which
was
cited
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
alluded,
for
example,
to
the
fact
that
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
on
may
23rd
1956,
willard
uphaus
took
the
fifth
amendment
when
asked
about
certain
of
the
things
he
was
asked
about
in
new
hampshire
before.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
cite
it
to
you,
because
your
honor,
if
he
took
the
fifth
amendment
honestly,
he
said
that,
"if
i
gave
a
truthful
answer,
i
might
subject
myself
to
the
risk
of
prosecution
for
a
crime
not
outlawed
by
the
statute
of
limitations."
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
not
quite
because
if
he
wants
to
avoid
the
risk
of
being
prosecuted,
if
he
thinks
that
those
responsible
for
the
handling
of
prosecutions
might
be
indiscreet
in
their
preparation
of
cases,
he
might
be
able
to
take
it
honestly
for
that
purpose.but
when
it
refers
to
a
time
in
history
--
and
this,
i
believe
it
referred
to
the
warsaw
peace
congress
outlawed
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
know
of
no
valid
reason
for
taking
the
fifth
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
think
that's
probably
so.
i
don't
think
that
simply
because
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment,
he
can
be
deprived
of
those
rights
without
notice
in
hearing
as
this
court
has
held
in
this
(inaudible)
case
and
in
certain
other
cases.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh,
well
this,
your
honor,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
inquiry
in
new
hampshire.
he
did
not
see
fit
to
take
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
in
new
hampshire.
and
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
i
--
we
dispute
that.
we
think
he
answered
with
less
than
candor
concerning
himself
personally
and
concerning
others
that
in
the
sense
of
questions
that
did
not
require
the
disclosure
of
any
names,
but
it
would
require
a
full
examination
of
all
the
transcripts
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
i
felt
that
the
fifth
amendment
used
by
mr.
uphaus
before
the
walters
committee
at
that
time
was
significant
because
it
took
the
american
league
for
war
and
fascism
or
the
american
committee
for
the
protection
of
the
foreign
born,
or
any
or
these
organizations
with
which
mr.
uphaus
may
have
been
associated
by
his
own
testimony
in
the
past.
and
he
says
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
and
yet,
when
he
is
asked
about,
who
the
people
were
that
were
with
him
when
he
called
on
the
american
ambassador
in
moscow,
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
i
only
cite
this
to
you
and
this
is
very
important
mr.
chief
justice.
we
don't
use
the
subversive
list
in
new
hampshire
with
any
element
of
censure.
we
don't
use
them
for
the
purpose
of
saying
anyone
is
guilty
of
anything
who
has
been
a
member
of
an
organization
on
that
list.
we
only
use
them
here
as
a
reason
for
inquiring
further
to
see
whether
there
was
subversion
in
new
hampshire.
now,
a
communist
or
more
has
been
active
in
these
organizations
or
they
could
never
possibly
have
been
cited.
cited
has
never
been
the
case
in
the
report
of
the
new
hampshire
legislature
that
we
submitted.
no
one
has
ever
been
cited
about
anything.
by
dr.
france's
own
argument
here,
at
least
four
of
the
speakers
that
are
referred
to
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
without
going
into
any
of
the
others,
were
communists
at
one
time.
all
we're
interested
in,
in
new
hampshire
in
the
balancing
process
which
is
the
$64
question
here
on
the
balancing
of
first
amendment
rights
against
the
public
interest
in
disclosure.
in
the
balancing
process,
we're
interested
in
finding
out
whether
these
people
were
just
having
a
--
a
hype
fest
or
whether
they
were
plotting
subversion,
and
intrigue
as
fantastic
as
it
may
sound
to
some.
and
that's
why
we
believe
that
the
information
called
for
is
relevant
and
pertinent
and
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
it.
and
that
we
do
not
in
that
process
trespass
upon
any
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
can't
answer
that
in
regard
to
all
of
the
meetings.
we
do
not
know
what
all
of
the
meetings
were
or
when
they
were
or
what
was
said
at
them.
but
we
do
know
there
is
a
sign
on
the
highway
just
below
conway,
new
hampshire
which
advertises
world
fellowship
incorporated
and
a
place
of
public
accommodation
and
invites
people
of
all
faiths
and
creeds
to
come
in
which
is
perfectly
proper.
it's
a
professionally
paid
place.
i
mean,
you
don't
go
in
and
stay
there
for
nothing.
you
have
to
pay
for
your
room
and
your
board.
and
we
have
a
statute
in
new
hampshire
and
have
had
for
some
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
which
requires
that
public
registers
be
kept
of
people
who
go
and
stay
in
such
places.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
suppose
technically
it
is
because
technically
i
am
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
state,
but
it
is
worded
as
being
available
to
the
sheriff
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
and
police
officers.
and
we
have
never
seen
that
at
this
point
to
go
in
and
take
that
list
in
the
police
centers.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
unless
--
unless
the
proprietor
of
such
a
place
and
when
i
say
such
a
place,
any
public
place
took
the
position
that
such
a
statute
was
unconstitutional
itself
as
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
that
no
police
power
of
the
state
or
public
welfare
of
the
state
required
such
a
register.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
just
a
moment,
your
honor.
we
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
it's
rsa
chapter
353,
section
3
and
it
appears
in
our
brief
at
page
25.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no
difference
except
that,
it
says,
‚Äúall
hotel
keepers‚Äù
and
i'm
quoting,
your
honor,
"all
hotel
keepers
and
all
persons
keeping
public
lodging
houses,
tourist
camps
or
cabins
shall
keep
a
book
or
card
system
and
cause
each
guest
to
sign
therein
his
own
legal
name
or
name
by
which
he
is
commonly
known.
said
book
or
card
system
shall
be
at
all
--
shall
at
all
times
be
open
to
the
inspection
of
the
sheriffs
or
his
deputies
or
any
police
officer."
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no
doubt,
whatever,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
the
list
that
is
called
for
by
the
subpoena
goes
way
beyond
anybody
who
stayed
overnight.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
oh,
yes.
we
--
we
feel
that
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
anyone
who
has
been
there
at
all.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
solely
--
solely
with
persons
who
have
spoken
or
have
been
invited
to
speak
and
have
spoken
at
world
fellowship.
now,
for
example
mary
rozak
was
referred
to
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
as
having
been
at
world
fellowship
and
talked
at
the
world
fellowship.
mary
rozak
has
been
identified
under
oath
as
a
former
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
i
say
former
because
again,
no
one
admits
openly
at
this
time
to
my
knowledge
to
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
at
least,
in
new
hampshire.
and
mary
rozak
did
talk
at
world
fellowship
in
the
1955
season.
that
would
be
one
of
the
things
we'd
like
to
find
out
and
we
believe
we're
entitled
to
without
violating
his
first
amendment
rights:
is
did
he
ask
you
to
come
there
and
advocate
with
the
intention
of
incitement
to
the
commission
of
an
overt
act
against
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
or
not?
i
realize,
and
when
i
say
that,
that
it
sounds
incredible
that
such
advocacy
or
such
urging
or
solicitation
could
have
taken
place
at
that
time
in
america
that
it
had
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
it's
very
doubtful.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
how
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
--
that's
probably
true.
and
that
was
what
was
--
what
i
meant
and
was
referred
to
by
mr.
boudin
in
his
argument
in
saying
it
most
unlikely
that
the
appellant
here
would
ever
openly
admit
or
put
down
in
writing
any
of
the
things
which
are
the
very
subject
matter
of
the
investigation.
he
says
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
probably,
your
honor,
i
would
assume
that
his
counsel
if
they
did
fact
show
anything
subversive
would
advise
him
to
take
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
new
hampshire
equivalent
and
decline
to
produce
it.
but
at
the
present
time,
that
position
has
not
been
taken.
we
do
not
know
whether
it
would
show
anything
subversive.
it
is
unlikely.
however,
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
new
hampshire,
the
supreme
court
in
new
hampshire
did
refer
to
the
fact
that
--
and
i
quote
from
page
22
of
the
first
jurisdictional
statement
which
was
filed
in
this
cause
originally
by
appellant,
a
book
available
at
the
center
entitled
‚Äúworld
fellowship
of
faith‚Äù
contained
an
article
which
after
supporting
communism
reads,
‚Äúif
any
government
stands
in
the
way,
that
government
must
be
overthrown.‚Äù
and
again,
there
were
statements
to
the
effect
that,
‚Äúif
any
people
stand
in
the
way,
that
people
must
be
destroyed,
we
must
banish
god
from
the
skies
and
capitalists
from
the
earth.‚Äù
the
witness
denies
that
he
subscribes
to
everything
in
this
publication.
the
witnesses'
views,
your
honor,
are
not
on
trial
here.
this
is
solely
a
fact
finding
investigation
and
we
have
attempted
to
impose
no
criminal
sanctions
whatever
upon
willard
uphaus.
he's
not
being
prosecuted
for
anything.
we
simply
would
like
to
know
in
new
hampshire,
what
this
organization
was
up
to
at
world
fellowship
and
who
was
there.
and
as
things
stand
now
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
i
have
not.
i
have
not.
i
have
undertaken
on
occasion
to
check
number
plates
that
have
gone
to
world
fellowship
incorporated
but
the
cost
of
maintaining
a
surveillance
of
the
place
was
beyond
any
budgetary
availability
in
my
state.
now
in
this
case
here,
the
appellant
and
again,
i'd
like
to
point
this
out
because
i
think
it's
important.
the
transcripts
will
show
that
the
appellant
took
the
position
with
the
superior
court
of
new
hampshire.
in
effect,
i
don't
care
if
you
order
me
to
produce
these
documents.
i
know
they
are
called
for
by
the
subpoenas.
i
came
here
to
court,
i
did
not
bring
them
with
me
and
i
will
not
produce
them
no
matter
what
you
do.
the
same
position
was
taken
before
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire.
and
now,
in
a
publication
entitled
‚Äúa
matter
of
conscience,‚Äù
the
appellant
says
the
same
thing
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
saying,
‚Äúin
an
appeal
for
funds,
that
if
the
attorney
general
--
‚Äù
and
i'm
quoting,
‚Äúof
new
hampshire
wins,
willard
uphaus,
being
the
man
that
he
is
will
go
to
jail
for
the
rest
of
his
life.‚Äù
in
effect,
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
decision
is
here.
the
witness
isn't
going
to
answer.
and
as
far
as
that,
it
relates
to
cruel
an
unusual
punishment,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
in
the
green
case
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
very
clearly
disposes
of
that
by
saying
that
in
such
circumstance,
mr.
uphaus
or
a
person
subject
to
a
contempt
order
holds
the
keys
to
his
own
dilemma
in
his
pocket
because
he
can't
comply
with
the
order
and
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
jail
or
spend
any
time
confined
even
overnight.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
valid
--
you
said
‚Äúvalid‚Äù,
your
honor.
and
you
said
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
civil
a
coercion
as
distinct
from
the
criminal
contempt
which
was
imposed
upon
green
and
some
of
the
others
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
years
1954
and
1955,
which
does
not
mean
your
honor
the
entire
year
but
merely
the
summer
season.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
all.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
two
months
on
each
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
of
those
years.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
not
all
of
them.
we
know
the
identity
of
quite
a
few
of
them.
we
are
not
sure
that
we
have
all
of
them
although
we
have
in
the
report
listed
a
great
many
of
the
speakers
because
we
believe
the
speakers
to
be
important.
and
the
speakers,
we
know
there
was
correspondence
with
some
of
them,
but
with
not
all
of
them.
now,
there
were
other
things
that
the
subpoena
has
called
for,
a
good
many
of
it.
and
those
things
have
been
disposed
of
in
this
case
either
by
the
appellant
saying,
‚Äúi
don't
have
any
of
that,‚Äù
which
we
didn't
question
or
by
his
saying
that
those
dealt
with
professional
employees
and
--
by
--
are
not
taking
an
exception
with
the
matter.
actually,
the
whole
question
here
is
confined
solely
to
the
production
of
the
guest
list
and
the
argument
which
is
made
that
production
of
the
guest
list
would
expose
the
guest
to
manifest
indignities
and
the
risk
of
being
classified
as
subversive
persons
and
so
forth,
which
is
utterly
untrue.
and
the
implication
which
is
tried
to
be
presented
to
the
court
that
the
minute
the
guest
list
is
given,
it's
going
to
be
published
in
a
red
report
to
the
general
court
which
will
smack
of
some
kind
of
a
taint
upon
the
guest,
which
is
also
untrue.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
if
it
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
except,
your
honor
that
the
rules
of
procedure
precluded
insofar
as
the
indiscriminate
names
of
public
--
in
public
of
people
are
concerned.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
sound
is
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
if
the
court
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
not
in
the
report
to
the
legislature.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
and
i
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
right.
and
we
believe
that
if
the
legislature
in
a
case
such
as
this
and
again,
trying
to
--
this
--
differentiate
myself
from
the
legislature
in
the
sense
only
that
i
am
a
committee
of
the
legislature.
if
the
legislature
wants
to
know
who
was
at
world
fellowship
incorporated,
it
is
absolutely
entitled
to
know,
who
was
at
world
fellowship
incorporated
in
new
hampshire
with
the
record
that
the
executive
director
of
world
fellowship
has.
and
with
the
record
of
communist
party
activity
and
the
association
that
people
who
have
spoken
there
have.
such
as
to
mention
names,
julian
schuman,
william
hampton,
scott
nearing,
clarence
loskin
who
took
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
same
investigation
in
new
hampshire
in
respect
to
activities
at
world
fellowship
incorporated.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
your
honor,
i
can
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
first
--
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
very
clearly
says
the
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion,
the
freedom
of
speech.
but
the
establishment
of
religion
is
something
which
goes
very
deeply
under
the
picture.
you
will
find
in
this
report
here
that
we
believe
that
mr.
uphaus'
position
as
far
as
religion
is
concerned
here,
is
a
bogus
and
hypocrisy
and
a
sham.
and
that
the
record
shows
that
to
be
the
case,
i
am
sorry
i
have
to
make
that
statement.
but
we
believe
that
to
be
the
case
and
the
facts.
and
that
behind
this
fa√ßade,
there
is,
in
all
probability
at
least,
new
hampshire
is
suspicious
of
it,
going
on
activity
and
furtherance
of
the
aims
and
the
objectives
of
the
communist
party
in
the
united
states.
that
being
the
case,
we
feel
that
we
are
not
in
the
position,
your
honor
at
all
here
of
your
suggestion
that
under
a
statute,
there
would
be
power
to
go
into
the
church,
authorized
ordained
church
and
investigate
the
activities
in
the
church
unless
it
were
perfectly
apparent
upon
an
overwhelming
record
that
it
was
not
a
bona
fide
church
and
that
the
activities
going
on
there
were
merely
a
masquerade
or
a
mask
with
which
to
cover
a
sabotage,
espionage
or
otherwise.
and
i
certainly
can
say
to
you
the
answer
is
‚Äúno.‚Äù
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
solely,
your
honor,
whether
members
of
the
communist
party
present
or
former
were
active
within
the
group
itself.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that's
all.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
first,
i
didn't
say,
‚Äúwas‚Äù
your
honor,
i
said,
‚Äúnow
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
admits.‚Äù
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
didn't
say
‚Äúwas.‚Äù
we
have
had
many
people
come
to
us
and
explain
that
they
had
been
in
the
communist
party
in
years
past
and
had
gotten
out
it
at
a
certain
time
and
the
reasons
for
their
going
into
it
and
their
affiliation
with
it
and
that
they
saw
no
evidence
while
they
were
there
of
force
and
violence
within
the
party
and
the
sense
that
it
was
an
operation
in
new
hampshire.
now,
if
somebody
came
in
today
and
said,
‚Äúyes,
i'm
a
communist.‚Äù
i've
had
that
happen.
the
gentleman
has
now
passed
away.
i
said
now
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
‚Äúdo
you
advocate
to
the
overthrow
of
the
government
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
by
force
and
violence?
‚Äúno
sir,
of
course
not.
‚Äúdo
you
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence?
‚Äúno,
of
course
not.‚Äù
and
you
go
through
a
very
capital
examination
of
such
a
witness
if
the
witness
is
answering
and
not
playing
cat
and
mouse
with
you,
your
honor,
and
you'll
find
that
he's
not
a
communist
at
all.
and
that
is
the
case,
now
if
there's
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
believe
i
did
sir.
i
think
that's
about
the
size
of
that.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
test
of
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
i
don't
think
that
if
the
person
doesn't
advocate
the
overthrow
or
alteration
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
all
the
free
capitalist
countries
by
force
and
violence,
if
that
ultimately
becomes
necessary
that
he's
following
the
marxist,
leninist
mind
which
the
stalin's
vision
of
the
manifesto
and
the
changes
in
the
development
of
the
doctrine
as
it's
come
over
the
years.
and
if
he
is
not
following
that
--
that
line,
then
he
certainly
is
getting
quite
far
afield
from
little
brother
and
foster
who
said
that
there
will
be
a
soviet
america
just
as
sure
as
the
sun
rises
tomorrow
morning,
whether
anybody
thinks
that's
ridiculous
or
not.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
have
just
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
excuse
me,
just
three
or
four
more
minutes.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
mr.
boudin
has
suggested
that
sweezy
in
the
sense
that
i
have
some
kind
of
a
roving
discretion
invalidates
this
particular
statute
because
the
resolution
is
too
broad.
we
don't
believe
that
to
be
the
case
but
i'd
like
to
say
this.
this
statute
was
drafted
in
the
--
almost
exact
language
of
the
bilbo
statute.
i
was
a
counsel
to
the
bilbo
committee
and
helped
prepare
the
resolution
under
which
senator
bilbo
was
investigated
in
mississippi
in
1946.
and
if
you'll
compare
the
resolution
investigating
senator
bilbo,
calling
for
that
investigation,
with
the
one
in
the
principal
case,
you
will
find
they
are
almost
identical.
in
fact,
we
took
the
language
from
that
resolution
in
putting
this
one
in
existence
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
don't
know
whether
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
senator
bilbo
died
before
that
case
was
finally
disposed
of
and
the
senator
had
cancer
of
the
mouth
and
throat.
as
far
as
a
--
a
roving
discretion
is
concerned,
we
believe
that
we
must
call
to
your
attention
for
what
your
discretion
believes
it
to
be,
were
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
when
you
sent
this
case
back
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
sweezy,
has
returned
it
with
an
opinion
saying,
in
effect,
that
they
believe
there
is
no
question
upon
this
record,
but
that
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
specifically
wants
the
information
requested
by
the
subpoenas.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
just
the
names
and
the
correspondence
with
them.
we
tried
to
find
out
as
far
as
we
could,
what
the
contents
of
the
speeches
were
by
asking
questions
and
there
is
a
lengthy
series
of
transcripts
on
that.
in
fact,
the
transcripts,
in
some
of
the
studies,
in
this
--
in
the
little
state
of
new
hampshire,
in
this
investigation
which
ultimately
resulted
in
the
report
in
this
case
would
probably
come
to
a
point
such
as
this.
and
out
of
those
transcripts,
there
had
only
been
to
my
knowledge,
three
people
who
have
taken
any
position
that
--
that
there
have
been
any
rights
abused.
that
doesn't
mean
they
can't
take
that
position
at
all
but
it
does
mean
that
in
most
instances,
i
think
everyone
was
in
agreement
that
they
weren't
being
pushed
around
and
i
think
this
record
will
show
that
dr.
uphaus
has
never
been
pushed
around
here,
either.
and
i
think
that's
important
too
because
the
suggestion
is
made
in
the
reply
brief,
that
in
some
manner,
what
we've
done
in
new
hampshire
is
akin
to
what
happened
in
1952
and
1953
in
some
of
the
worst
abuses
that
the
court
is
familiar
with
at
the
time
of
the
zenith
of
these
types
of
investigations.
and
that
is
something
that
i
myself
having
the
responsibility
for
these
investigations,
i'm
extremely
anxious
that
the
record
in
this
case
shall
prove
to
this
court
that
we
have
not
done
that.
even
though
i
do
admit
that
it
has
been
necessary
to
report
to
the
legislature
concerning
to
the
speakers
and
those
active
at
world
fellowship
in
great
detail.
but
that
report
was
something
which
was
in
relation
to
the
question
before
the
legislature
of
whether
in
new
hampshire,
legislation
would
be
necessary
to
classify
organizations
as
subversive
or
not
subversive
vis-a-vis
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
and
that
is
something
which
we
recommended
against.
we
said
that
we
don't
think
it's
necessary.
we
only
have
one
organization
in
the
state
above
which
there
is
question
and
it's
still
under
investigation.
and
that
organization
is
world
fellowship
incorporated.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
was
the
professor
as
far
as
i
know
and
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
do
not
know
your
honor
without
looking
at
the
record
but
i
can
tell
you
that
in
the
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
can
tell
you
that
in
the
transcript,
mr.
uphaus
testified
that
he
went
to
paris
and
to
moscow,
to
london
and
to
moscow
at
the
invitation
and
accepted
the
direction
of
that
group
at
the
invitation
of
joliot-curie.
and
that
is
just
a
part
of
the
case.
now,
i
don't
cite
that.
and
i
don't
say
that,
your
honor,
in
any
censure
of
willard
uphaus,
but
merely
to
try
to
show
why
we
believe
that
with
this
type
of
record,
we
were
at
least
entitled
to
inquire
to
see
whether
communist
activity
in
the
sense
of
subversion
and
intrigue
had
taken
place
in
new
hampshire
at
world
fellowship.
now,
we
think
when
all
the
interests
are
balanced,
and
the
whole
question
is
considered
in
the
sense
of
trying
to
see
the
rights
of
the
state
as
opposed
to
a
reasonable
measuring
concern
with
the
rights
of
the
individual
involved,
that
there
is
a
clear
room
here
for
valid
legislation,
there
is
clear
room
for
judicial
sanction
of
the
relevant
question
and
for
a
judicial
affirmance,
we
believe
that
in
the
united
states,
once
you
find
the
statute
to
be
constitutional,
the
resolution
calling
for
the
investigation
to
be
sufficiently
definite
and
clear
and
the
question
put
under
the
resolution
to
be
relevant,
to
be
good.
once
you
find
that,
which
has
been
found
in
new
hampshire
in
a
hearing
before
a
court
after
extensive
argument.
then,
the
only
thing
available
to
the
witness
is
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
the
first
amendment
because
you
come
into
your
first
amendment
argument,
then
your
argument
before
the
court
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
this
is
not
an
investigation
of
candy
making
or
business
cocktails
or
of
lobbying
such
as
the
rumely
case.
just
as
the
court
held
in
the
rumely
case,
if
this
were
an
investigation
of
subversion,
our
answer
would
undoubtedly
be
different.
and
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing
about
the
rumely
case
where
the
court
said
that
we
don't
want
--
we
don't
want
to
have
an
unlimited
invasion
of
the
thinking
processes
that
all
that's
involved
in
the
list
to
whom
they
sent
the
magazine
in
the
committee
of
constitutional
government
is
a
saturation
of
thinking
processes.
if
dr.
rumely
had
a
list
instead
of
the
people
that
met
in
the
wing
of
the
capital
for
the
purpose
of
handing
money
to
members
of
congress,
to
influence
legislation,
can
it
be
denied
that
that
list
would
not
have
been
clearly
relevant
and
pertinent
and
within
the
committee's
function
to
obtain.
we
say
here
that
on
this
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
we
believe
this
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
we
believe
we
have,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
communist
--
by
any
court
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
the
answer
is
that
--
that
as
i
understand
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
in
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
the
subversive
activities
controlled
more
from
the
second
time
has
said
the
communist
party
itself
is
and
i
believe
that
question
is
on
its
way
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
back
up
here.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
we
refer
to
him
now
that
many
members
of
the
communist
party
were
at
world
fellowship
incorporated,
yes
your
honor.
we
refer
him
there
to
transcripts
in
the
past
which
a
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
for
the
purposes
of
investigating
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
subversion,
we
believe
that
shows
more
than
is
necessary
to
establish
the
relevancy
of
the
question
yes.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
to
this
extent.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
it
is
my
opinion
now.
and
it
has
been
for
some
time
that
a
communist
who
was
a
genuine
communist
is
an
enemy
of
the
united
states
and
seeks
to
destroy
this
court
and
the
court
system
in
new
hampshire
and
all
over
this
world.
i
am
as
convinced
of
that
as
anything
i
can
be,
but
that
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
is
beside
the
point.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
now,
the
new
hampshire
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
the
new
hampshire
legislature
feels
i
think
from
the
preamble
of
the
statute
the
same
way
and
has
directed
the
communist
activity,
they
used
the
word
subversive.
communist
activity
should
be
investigated
in
my
state.
i
have,
and
taken
that,
to
mean
that
whenever,
a
communist
or
a
former
communist
is
in
my
state,
the
legislature
would
like
to
know
what
for
and
why.
i
have
never
attempted
to
erect
a
fence
around
the
state
and
say,
‚Äúkeep
out.‚Äù
here,
we
have
the
unique
fact
that
communists
or
former
communists
from
all
over
the
world
have
come
to
a
place
in
new
hampshire
and
we
are
not
able
yet
to
find
out
who
was
there.
we
believe
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
this
information.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
there
is
repeatedly
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
i
will
say
joliot-curie
but
there
are
many
others,
mr.
chief
justice
whom
--
on
--
have
been
testified
under
oath
before
a
number
of
committees
by
informers
if
you
wish
to
use
the
phrase.
herbert
philbrick
has
identified
at
least
three
of
these
people
as
former
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
there's
a
serious
question
about
the
validity
of
the
testimony
of
mr.
matusow,
there's
no
question
about
it.
he's
recanted
the
great
deal
of
that
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
testimony.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
i
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
i
certainly
intend
to,
your
honor,
and
i'll
confine
myself
to
that
now
except
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
--
to
refer
the
one
thing
here
that
at
pages
17,
39,
40,
43,
51,
72,
and
74
of
the
first
transcript
of
dr.
uphaus'
testimony,
there
are
--
it
mentioned
a
number
of
individuals
and
whom
he
recognizes
as
present
or
former
members
of
the
communist
party.
in
the
question
of
the
preemption,
we
take
the
position
simply
that
the
new
hampshire
statute
which
is
patterned
on
the
overact
is
saved
by
a
separability
clause,
that
this
court
in
the
purpose
to
its
opinion
in
the
steve
nelson
decision
when
the
chief
justice
spoke,
he
said
this
case
--
the
instant
case
is
concerned
only
with
sedition
against
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
there
was
never
in
the
steve
nelson
case
intended
by
this
court
to
outlaw
those
provisions
of
state
statutes
which
prohibited
--
attempted
to
regulate
sedition
against
the
state
government.
our
statute
very
clearly
and
it's
printed
as
an
appendix
both
to
the
report
and
to
the
brief
and
to
the
plaintiff's
jurisdictional
statement
contains
a
separability
clause
which
strikes
out
from
the
subversive
activities
law
in
new
hampshire,
now,
the
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof
in
the
light
of
the
steve
nelson
decision
and
in
such
in
place
thereof,
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
is
already
in
there
and
continues
in
there
by
a
virtue
of
the
separability
clause.
that
we
believe
gives
us
full
authority
to
legislate
in
that
field
or
to
amend.
but
we
take
the
position
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
we
have
the
power
to
investigate
as
distinct
from
to
legislate
whether
or
not
the
provision
relating
to
the
united
states
government
is
superseded
by
the
steve
nelson
decision
until
and
unless
congress
acts
otherwise
that
being
the
case,
there
was
language
in
the
steve
nelson
opinion
which
indicated
that
the
states
sedition
statutes
were
merely
suspended
in
there
enforceability.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
by
that
the
court
meant
that
they
were
off
the
books
completely
or
they
were
to
continue
on
the
books
until
such
time
as
congress
either
amended
the
smith
act
or
removed
it
entirely
from
the
books.
but
if
this
--
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
thank
you
all,
your
honors.
in
--
in
this
situation,
by
that
provision,
it's
very
clear
that
whether
the
enforceability
was
suspended
or
not,
that
a
committee
may
investigate
in
aid
of
legislation,
even
though
that
legislation
if
ultimately
enacted
might
be
unconstitutional
or
might
be
in
the
field
in
which
they
could
only
be
in
a
standby
status.
but,
it's
very
clear
that
legislation
designed
to
protect
the
security
and
sovereignty
and
integrity
of
the
state
is
not
struck
down
by
the
steve
nelson
decision.
and
we
believe
that
the
tenth
amendment,
in
fact,
would
reserve
such
a
power
to
the
state
governments
in
any
event
although
recognizing
that
arguments
can
be
made
on
both
sides
of
that
proposition.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
on
a
number
of
instances.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
well,
we
take
the
position
that
when,
for
example,
and
i
hesitate
to
use
this
phrase
but
it
appears
in
the
transcript
when
--
this,
‚Äúgod
bless
the
revolution.‚Äù
the
question
was
asked
and
the
question
was
asked
by
what
kind
of
a
revolution
you
mean
by
that?
"oh,
just
any
kind
of
a
revolution."
it
appears
in
the
transcript
that
that
--
that
revolution
may
very
well
have
been
directed,
if
in
fact,
it
was
intended
even
in
a
trite
way
against
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
it's
something
about
which
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
is
concerned
and
would
like
to
know.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
no,
your
honor,
because
it
appears
to
us
and
we
take
the
position
consistently
that
communist
apparatus
of
conspiracy
and
the
conspiratorial
senses
directed
against
the
capitalist
system
as
distinct
from
any
particular
form
of
government
and
that
it
is
definitely
directed
against
the
security
and
integrity
of
each
of
the
states
just
as
well
as
it
against
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
c.
wyman
that
is
the
basis
of
the
argument,
your
honor.
and
in
addition
to
that
fact,
that
these
were
activities
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire
to
which
these
people
came
which
were
directed
definitely
toward
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
has
in
this
field
over
a
period
of
four
or
five
years,
now,
had
several
decisions
which
relate
in
a
quite
sweeping
way
to
the
communist
party
and
powers
to
investigate
it
which
in
partnership
with
the
federal
government.
