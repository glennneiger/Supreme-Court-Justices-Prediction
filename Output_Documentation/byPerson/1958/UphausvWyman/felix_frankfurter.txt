justice

frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
vagueness
(inaudible)
seven
members
don't
recognize
what
i
think
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
vagueness
is
of
course
technical
for
me,
a
technical
doctrine
under
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
can
see
you
get
out
of
it
was
the
right
they
didn't
intend
to
put
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
is
often
the
case,
as
between
lawyers
and
justices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
it
incorporated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
attorney,
whether
the
code
of
procedure
by
which
you
were
governed
as
a
member
of
the
committee
of
your
legislature,
whether
that
was
an
ad
hoc
court
--
court
of
procedure
for
purposes
of
this
--
the
inquiry
with
which
you
were
charged
or
is
it
a
standing
code
of
procedure
for
legislative
inquiry
by
your
legislature?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
the
legislature
as
such
approved
the
sanction
of
your
procedural
method
--
your
procedural
dealings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
the
communist
party
cease
to
be
on
any
of
your
electoral
tickets?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
and
you
would
feel
that
within
your
jurisdiction
to
make
inquiries
into
the
activities
of
a
fascist
party
or
suspected
by
you
will
be
an
organization
having
fascias
purposes
whatever
they
may
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
if
he
gets
the
register
with
the
sheriff,
that
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
sheriff
if
he
doesn't
get
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
category
under
which
access
was
given
to
the
sheriff?
how
are
these
places
are
described
i
should
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what,
how
do
you
categorize?
would
you
mind
telling
me?
how
are
they
different
from
having
the
state
going
and
find
out
who's
registered
as
the
mayflower
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
there
any
doubt
that
this
place
was
subject
to
that
book
as
a
requirement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
doubt
the
sheriff
could
get
this
list
about
which
there
is
always
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
did
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anybody
who
stays
there
during
the
day
or
â€“-
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
reach
of
your
subpoena
as
to
the
private
correspondence
of
mr.
uphaus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
that
neither
you
nor
dr.
france
mentioned
the
most
distinguished
name
among
the
list
of
guests,
joliot-curie,
was
that
the
professor
or
madam
curie?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
was
he
even
mentioned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
insofar
as
both
of
you
slighted
the
one
great
name
in
the
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
say
joliot-curie?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
question
about
that.
he
takes
pride
to
look
back.
he's
a
very,
very
distinguished
person.
and
he
takes
pride
to
the
fact
that
it
was
(inaudible)
relevant
to
answer
the
question.
i
don't
want
you
to
think
about
any
the
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
even
say
anything
about
the
preemption,
the
nelson
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
publication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
--
i
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
quite
agree
with
everything
you
said
about
julio
curry
or
anybody
else
being
there
or
not
endangering
the
foundations
of
new
hampshire
or
anything
else,
but
does
that
answer
all
the
constitutional
questions,
the
mere
fact
that
i
think
that?
does
that
conclude
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
new
hampshire
may
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
everybody
knows,
as
i
suggest
today,
he
takes
pride
in
promoting
the
communist
cause.
and
of
course,
when
the
great
figures
in
the
scientific
world
(inaudible)
--
that
i
entirely
agree
with
you
as
i
do
as
a
human
being
because
you
take
care
of
all
my
problems
in
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
question
raised
as
to
the
breadths
of
the
subpoena?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
all
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
whether
any
objection
was
made
that
the
subpoena
violates
constitutional
rights
because
of
its
breadth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
enjoin
that
a
private
person
did
that?
could
you
enjoin
the
publication
of
such
a
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
though
you
couldn't
on
the
near,
that
would
be
an
infringement
of,
in
itself,
the
freedom
of
speech.
you
could
sue
them
for
libel,
but
you
couldn't
enjoin
them,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
inquiries
otherwise
relevant,
i'm
not
now
defining
what
would
be
relevant,
the
inquiries
otherwise
relevant
elicited
by
a
congressional
committee
that
brings
people
into
distribution
while
they
could
not
be
compelled
by
a
congressional
committee
merely
because
the
man
don't
have
to
have
very
fastidious
case
to
be
unwilling
to
make
that
disclosure
and
i,
myself,
happen
to
have
strong
views
on
that
subject,
but
could
congress
be
prevented
from
asking
questions
from
witnesses
when
the
questions
are
otherwise
relevant
merely
because
the
answers
bring
other
people
into
distribution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
relevant
so
they
can't
be
asked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
that.
but
if
--
if
that
were
allowed
and
while
it
may
say
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
not
allowing
it
is
that
it
brings
names
into
distribution,
the
fact
that
it
brings
other
people's
names
into
distribution,
doesn't
thereunder
constitutional
issue
from
my
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon.
this
is
the
second
time
you've
said
that.
and
i
was
much
startled
by
it
the
first
time.
why
do
you
say
for
life,
mr.
france?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
for
life.
that
isn't
the
question
we've
got
here,
is
it?
