mr.
royal
w.
france
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
for
the
second
time.
it
arises
under
the
same
statute
and
under
the
same
procedures
as
were
involved
in
the
case
of
sweezy
--
sweezy
versus
new
hampshire,
which
was
recently
decided
by
this
court
and
as
to
which
we
think
the
decision
of
the
court
is
conclusive
upon
the
instant
case.
the
case
when
it
came
before
this
court
was
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
decision
in
sweezy
versus
new
hampshire.
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
having
reconsidered
said
that
they
have
not
altered
their
view.
in
the
first
decision,
there
were
three
of
the
judges
of
the
new
hampshire
court
who
were
in
favor
of
affirming
the
sentence
of
contempt
and
then,
the
second
--
and
two
who
dissented,
and
then
the
second
decision
that
the
court
having
changed
its
composition.
there
were
four
in
favor
of
reaffirming
their
own
decision
and
one
who
dissented.
they
--
your
honors
will
recall
that
the
statute
under
which
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
proceeds
is
one
which
relates
to
subversive
activities
which
i
define
as
activities
looking
toward
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
we
shall
present
four
points
for
the
consideration
of
the
court,
the
first
that
the
information
sought
by
the
attorney
general
is
irrelevant
and
it
involves
protected
first
amendment
rights.
second,
that
the
--
a
mandate
--
mandate
of
the
new
hampshire
legislature
is
vague.
and
third,
that
this
statute
has
been
superseded
under
the
doctrine
of
pennsylvania
versus
nelson.
and
fourth,
that
the
indefinite
sentence
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
will
present
the
first
two
of
these
points
and
my
colleague,
mr.
boudin
will
present
the
others.
in
order
to
understand
how
this
case
comes
before
the
court
and
why
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
appears
to
think
that
the
information
he
seeks
is
relevant.
it
becomes
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
something
about
dr.
willard
uphaus,
the
appellant,
and
world
fellowship
of
which
he
is
the
executive
director.
it
clearly
appears
from
the
record
that
here
is
an
unusual
type
of
man
who
takes
quite
literally
the
principles
enunciated
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount.
he
was
a
--
a
religious
youth
active
in
the
ymca
and
in
the
methodist
church.
he
--
he
went
to
college
and
from
there,
to
the
yale
university,
where
he
took
his
doctor
of
philosophy
degree
in
the
field
of
religion.
he
became
a
professor
of
religion
in
a
midwestern
college
and
later
at
yale
university.
following
this,
he
became
the
director
of
the
religion
and
labor
foundation,
an
organization
which
was
formed
by
religious
and
labor
leaders
with
a
view
to
discussing
common
problems
affecting
these
two
groups.
while
he
was
serving
in
that
capacity,
he
was
invited
with
a
group
of
other
--
rather
prominent
americans
to
attend
a
world
peace
conference
which
should
have
represented
delegates
from
both
sides
of
the
so-called
iron
curtain.
this
conference
was
to
be
in
london.
while
they
were
on
the
high
seas,
the
british
government
decided
that
it
would
not
admit
the
delegates
from
the
eastern
european
countries.
and
the
site
of
the
conference
was
transferred
to
warsaw.
from
warsaw,
the
appellant
made
a
visit
of
10
days
to
the
soviet
union.
this
trip
is
one
of
the
main
features
of
the
attorney
general's
complaint
against
dr.
uphaus.
mr.
royal
w.
france
that
was
--
it
took
place
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
in
1948,
i
think,
of
march.
the
--
the
--
when
he
returned,
there
was
a
schism
in
the
religion
in
labor
committee
as
to
whether
he
had
done
the
right
thing
in
taking
this
trip.
and
he
left
that
organization
and
became
the
executive
director
of
the
american
peace
crusade.
the
american
peace
crusade
was
an
organization
of
which
i
happened
to
be
the
attorney,
which
came
under
attack
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
on
the
theory
that
it
was,
in
some
sense,
a
subversive
organization.
now,
the
record
in
that
case
showed
that
there
was
nothing
agitated
or
done
by
the
american
peace
crusade
except
to
urge
a
more
resilient
foreign
policy
and
peaceful
coexistence
with
the
soviet
union.
however,
there
were
also
the
attorney
general
claims
in
the
organization,
some
people
who
were
or
were
reputed
to
be
communists,
people
of
the
type
of
paul
robeson.
this
was
deliberately
formed
by
the
founders
in
order
that
people
of
different
views
might
come
together
to
discuss
peace.
it
was
the
concept
of
the
american
peace
crusade
that
it
doesn't
do
any
good
to
discuss
peace
with
your
friends
or
those
who
agree
with
you
that
the
--
it's
necessary
for
people
of
varying
views
to
come
together.
and
that
--
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
representatives
of
our
government
to
discuss
these
affairs
with
those
countries
with
whom
we
are
not
in
accord.
so,
that
if
there
were
communists
in
the
american
peace
crusade,
it
was
with
deliberate
intent,
represented
the
american
peace
crusade
met
with
the
quakers
in
philadelphia
in
a
joint
meeting
in
which
the
problems
of
peace
were
discussed.
following
his
connection
with
the
american
peace
crusade
and
before
it
was
attacked
by
the
attorney
general,
it's
now
--
it
has
never
been
determined
by
a
litigation
that
it
was
in
fact
a
subversive
organization.
the
matter
is
now
under
judicial
consideration
awaiting
the
determination
of
this
court
with
regard
to
the
communist,
the
listing
of
the
communist
party.
so,
that
neither
this
organization,
nor
any
of
the
other
organizations
which
have
been
mentioned
by
the
appellee
as
being
a
cause
why
he
investigated
willard
uphaus
and
the
world
fellowship
have
ever
been
found
by
the
courts,
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
laid
down
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
case
to
--
to
be
in
fact
subversive,
and
indeed,
they
--
as
was
held
in
wieman
versus
updegraff
by
this
court.
the
list
itself
was
never
designed
for
such
purposes
as
it
is
now
being
used
for.
and
certainly,
no
one
under
that
decision
can
be
held
to
be
suspected
of
anything
unless
he
had
--
was
shown
to
have
knowledge,
scienter
that
the
organization
was
in
fact
subversive.
the
appellant's
position
here
is
that
he
not
only
had
no
scienter
that
it
was
subversive,
but
then
he
knew
these
organizations
were
not
subversive,
that
they
were
indeed
organizations
to
which
a
loyal
american
had
a
right
to
the
law.
willard
uphaus
following
his
directorship
in
the
american
peace
crusade
became
the
director
of
new
hampshire
corporation
known
here
as
world
fellowship.
world
fellowship
was
founded
by
an
idealistic
person
named
willard
with
the
idea
of
bringing
people
of
all
races,
creeds,
political
opinions
together
for
adult
education
and
discussion.
and
that
he
gave
to
the
organization
a
large
acreage
in
the
white
mountains
where
they
were
to
establish
the
world
fellowship
camp.
mr.
royal
w.
france
well,
it
was
founded
in
the
1930's.
willard
uphaus
became
director
of
it
in
1951.
mr.
royal
w.
france
and
they
admit
1952,
i
think.
mr.
royal
w.
france
that's
right.
the
--
the
organization
operated
a
summer
camp.
it
invited
paying
guests.
it
--
it
had
guest
lecturers.
many
of
them
are
clergymen,
many
of
them
college
professors,
social
workers
who
presented
various
aspects
of
human
relations
including
the
problems
relating
to
peace.
now,
the
attorney
general
in
his
statement
of
reason
why
this
organization
should
be
subject
to
investigation
has
listed
on
page
--
no,
no.
i
want
this
for
a
reason.
i
thought
i
had
it
slipped
in
this
brief.
on
pages
30
to
--
30
to
31
of
this
brief,
the
appellee
has
listed
the
reasons
why
he
believes
that
this
information
is
so
vital
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire
that
the
interference
with
first
amendment
rights
is
justified.
now,
the
first
of
these
reasons
is
that
the
willard
uphaus
by
his
own
testimony
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
i'm
reading
on
page
30
of
appellee's
brief.
that
the
witness,
willard
uphaus
by
his
own
testimony,
has
been
a
member
or
sponsor
of
many
organizations
which
persons
in
positions
or
responsibility
in
the
united
states
have
believed
to
be
communist-infiltrated
or
communist-controlled,
and
hence,
at
the
very
least
potentially
subversive
in
the
language
of
the
new
hampshire
statute.
now,
this
is
really
the
gravamen
of
the
charge.
the
attorney
general
has
listed
a
large
number
of
speakers
and
guests
at
the
world
fellowship
in
new
hampshire.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
any
of
these
speakers
advocated
anything
improper.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
advocated
any
opinion
proper.
the
camp
was
an
open
camp
to
which
not
only
people
who
knew
about
it
were
solicited
but
they
had
road
signs
inviting
guests
to
come.
and
so,
the
--
the
idea
that
there
was
anything
conspiratorial
about
this
camp
is
really
--
there's
no
foundation
for
it.
however,
after
he
had
asked
willard
uphaus
an
inquiry
before
him
or
about
himself
and
willard
uphaus
had
frankly
stated
that
he
belonged
to
various
organizations
which
were
under
condemnation
by
the
attorney
general.
he
stated
that
he
had
never
been
a
communist.
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
use
of
force
and
violence
in
any
context.
that
he
was
a
religious
pacifist.
and
that
the
organizations
to
which
he
belonged
were
peace
organizations
or
organizations
related
to
the
subject
--
subjects
in
which
he
vitally
believed.
at
the
back
of
the
attorney
general's
brief
is
a
list,
quite
an
extensive
list
of
the
alleged
errors
of
appellant.
appendix
a
on
page
39
contains
what
the
appellee
considers
to
be
the
reasons
why
the
--
his
--
his
demand
for
the
production
of
the
guest
list
and
the
correspondents
with
speakers
that
this
institution
was
justified.

here
again,
is
a
--
an
organization
which
has
never
been
found
to
be
subversive.
it

are
to
bring
about
peaceful
coexistence
with

that
--
this
again
is
an
organization
which
is
interested
in
the
preservation
of
the
rights
of
foreign
born
citizens,
certainly
nothing
improper
or
subversive
in
this
sort
of
activity.
citizens

for
harry

cited
as
a
communist
organization
by
the
attorney
general.
now,
this
organization
which
was
favored
(inaudible)
for
harry
bridges
was
sponsored
by
the
cio
leadership
and
many
people
in
--
prominent
people
in
american
life.
the
american
friends
for
spanish
democracy,
many
--
many
fine
people
including
clergymen
and
liberals
all
over
the
country
believed
in
the
defense
of
the
spanish
democracy
as
against
the
fascist
rebellion.
and
certainly
mr.
--
dr.
uphaus
has
no
apology
for
belonging
to
an
organization
that
was
the
friends
of
the
spanish
democracy.

he
signed
a

for
clemency

case.
the

i
have
it
here,
a
photostatic
copy
of
this
petition
which
contains
the
names
of
several
hundred
of
the
prominent
clergymen
and
religious
leaders
of
the
country
in
which
they
asked
the
president
to
exercise
--
to
suspend
the
death
sentence
in
the
rosenberg
case
as
indeed
--
did
the
late
pope
pious
xii
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
believes
that
that
clemency
should
have
been
granted
to
the

it
was
certainly
a
protected
activity.
now,
the
american
technical
society
for
the
aid
to
hispanic
democracy,
dr.
uphaus
said
he
never
heard
of
it.
but
if
it
existed,
he
probably
would
have
been
glad
to
join
them.
the
national
council
for
peace
of
which
he
was
the
director
of
the
conference
was
held
in
a
large
methodist
church
in
washington
with
clergymen
and
other
religious
leaders
present,
and
some
of
the
most
prominent
religious
leaders
of
the
country
spoke
at
that
conference.
he
wrote
--
so
the
attorney
general
says
two
articles
for
the
world
review.
well,
why
not?
unless
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
articles,
why
is
it
brought
up
here?
he
attended
a
public
meeting
in
new
york
for
the
civil
rights
congress,
liberty
runs.
we
reached
the
point
where
a
man
attending
a
meeting,
thereby,
is
charged
with
all
the
views
or
opinions,
that
may
be
expressed
there.
he
is
described
--
he
described
himself
as
a
christian
socialist.
the
appellant
says
or
the
appellee
says
he's
a
member
of
the
party.
insofar
as
i
know,
there
is
no
christian
socialist
party.
it
was
dr.
uphaus'
own
description
of
his
own
political
belief.
here,
the
world
council
for
peace,
i've
already
spoken
of
his
trip
to
the
soviet
union,
the
interfaith
committee
for
peace
action.
many
a
prominent
clergymen
were
on
this
committee.
he
does
not
remember
the
labor
committee
to
combat
german
rearmament
that
he
said
he
would
have
combated
german
rearmament.
the
congress
for
peace
was
a
large
congress
attended
by
some
5000
people
and
addressed
by
prominent
religious
leaders.
the
second
world
peace
conference
was
the
same
as
the
first
one.
the
mid-century
peace
congress
was
held
in
chicago.
it
was
addressed
by
reverend
henry
hitt
crane,
one
of
the
leading
methodist
ministers
of
the
united
states
and
other
prominent
clergymen.
and
he
--
he
is
listed
as
being
the
editorial
advisor
of
the
protestant
digest
that
he
said
he
didn't
remember,
it
might
--
maybe
he
was.
then
he
lists
on
the
next
page
42,
the
conference
on
peaceful
activities
to
the
atlantic
alternatives,
the
atlantic
pact,
a
large
meeting
held
in
a
church
in
washington.
the
methodist
federation
for
social
action
which
he
is
proud
to
be
a
member
although
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
doesn't
like
it
and
says
that
it's
--
has
communist
objectives.
dr.
uphaus'
contention
is
that
the
creed
of
the
methodist
church
does
by
its
very
nature
have
socialist
objectives
and
--
and
objectives
for
peace.
he
signed
an
appeal
for
amnesty
for
11
communist
party
leaders
along
with
such
prominent
americans
as,
mrs.
eleanor
roosevelt
and
norman
thomas,
roger
baldwin
and
others.
he
was
a

he's
listed
here
as
having
been
at
the
mid-century
conference
for
peace,
the
american
friends
of

on

on.

attorney
general
forgets
to
tell
you
that
when
this
case
was
reviewed
by
the
judicial
tribunal
of
the
united
nations,
both
ruth
crawford
and
mary
jane
keeney
were
awarded
heavy
damages
for
improper
dismissal.
my
colleague
points
out
to
me
that
the
time
is
running.
i
would
like
your
honors
to
read
the
report
of
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
to
the
legislature.
for
reasons
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief,
we
did
not
consent
to
the
submission
of
this
report
to
the
court
but
the
attorney
general
contends
that
he
has
a
right
to
submit
it
that
the
court
below
referred
to
it.
and
so
we
will
make
no
objection.
i
hope
that
your
honors
will
read
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
he's
going
to
submit
it,
he
says.
mr.
royal
w.
france
and
i
have
said
i
will
make
no
formal
objection
although
i
think
that
because
of
so
many
misstatements
in
the
report
on
the
hearsay
nature
of
the
report
that
it
was
not
competent
or
relevant
but
i'm
making
no
objection
to
it.
and
in
fact,
i
would
desire
the
court
to
read
this
entire
report
beginning
at
page
136
of
this
report.
he
lists
a
lot
of
people
ministers,
a
prominent
lawyer
who
was
once
the
president
of
the
national
lawyers
guild.
and
this
is
a
sin
according
to
the
attorney
general.
but
i
am
very
proud
to
be
a
member
of
the
national
lawyers
guild.
it
is
true
that
it
was
attacked
by
the
attorney
general.
but
the
present
attorney
general
has
--
when
litigation
was
started
has
dropped
the
charges
against
the
lawyers
guild
because
of
the
lack
of
necessary
proof.
the
names
here
are
the
names
of
people
quite
obviously
have
liberal
persuasion.
there's
only
one
who
the
attorney
general
says
was
--
said
--
admitted
that
he
was
a
communist
15
years
ago.
and
dr.
scott
nearing,
a
famous
educator
according
to
the
attorney
general
ran
for
the
--
for
office
on
the
communist
ticket
in
1928
and
was
later
expelled
by
the
communist
party.
this
is
the
kind
of
information
submitted
to
the
general
court
of
new
hampshire
as
justifying
the
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
of
not
only
the
appellant
here
but
of
the
guests
whom
he
has
entertained
at
the
world
fellowship
camp.
now,
i
have
just
a
few
minutes
left
of
my
time
to
discuss
the
nature
of
the
punishment.
it
will
be
apparent
to
the
court
from
what
i
have
briefly
said
and
from
a
closer
reading
of
the
record
that
here
is
an
intensely
religiously
motivated
man.
he
is
a
pacifist.
the
attorney
general
in
his
report
equates
that
--
equates
pacifism
with
the
violent
overthrow
of
government.
this
is
about
as
far
removed
as
i
can
imagine.
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
we
quote
the
appellee,
what
he
said
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
the
bottom
of
page
14,
“it
is,
of
course,
obvious
that
mr.
uphaus
isn't
going
to
write
someone
and
ask
them
to
come
and
make
a
speech
about
overthrowing
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
at
the
same
time,
the
advocacy
of
a
doctrine
that
we
lay
down
our
arms
in
favor
of
a
few
sticks
and
stones
paving
the
way
for
the
coming
of
the
soviet
union
is
just
as
much
an
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
government.”
if
this
is
not
a
farfetched
concept,
truly
the
description
of
the
past
disposition
in
this
passage
is
--
is
rather
distorted.
i
don't
know
that
pacifists
advocate
the
use
of
sticks
and
stones
but
the
concept
that
a
religious
pacifist
is
thereby
advocating
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence
stretches
imagination
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
mind.
there's
only
one
substantive
statement
in
the
--
in
the
entire
record
that
--
of
anything
that
occurred
at
the
world
fellowship
camp
that
could
be
the
--
in
anyway
remoted
--
remotely
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
attorney
general's
inquiry.
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
asked
a
blessing
on
revolution.
the
incident
was
so
trivial
that
he'd
forgotten
it.
when
the
attorney
general
questioned
me,
he
said,
“oh,
yes,”
someone
had
--
had
handed
him
a
little
slip
with
the
words,
“some
have
bread,
others
have
none.
god
bless
the
revolution.”
the
--
the
state
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
uses
this
as
a
part
of
the
justification
for
its
decision.
but
as
really
not
have
pointed
out
revolution
is
not
a
violent
affair
necessarily.
the
--
the
industrial
revolution
was
one
of
the
greatest
in
history.
i
assume
that
the
revolution
of
the
new
deal,
many
people
thought
it
was
revolutionary.
and
the
attorney
general
himself
i
think
would
concede
that
there
--
the
mere
use
of
the
term
revolution
in
a
rather
light
and
flippant
way
like
that
scarcely
amounts
to
an
advocacy
of
force
and
violence
such
as
to
justify
this
proceeding.
and
i
might
say
that
willard
uphaus
does
believe
that
if
we
would
accept
the
sermon
on
the
mountain
as
being
something
by
which
we
must
live,
that
it
would
affect
a
revolution
in
this
beautiful
and
bountiful
world
which
would
change
it
so
that
we
would
turn
bombs
into
plow
shears
and
guided
missiles
into
pruning
hooks.
mr.
royal
w.
france
if
the
court,
please.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire,
i
find
myself
somewhat
amazed
by
certain
statements
that
he
has
made.
how
he
could
say
that
a
man
like
willard
uphaus
who
appeared
before
him
and
then
told
him
everything
about
his
beliefs,
his
conscientious
beliefs,
his
own
activities
or
he
could
say
he
was
a
bogus
is
beyond
my
comprehension.
on
page
23
of
the
record
in
this
case,
the
methodist
minister
under
whom
he
served
for
eight
years
said,
"during
the
eight
years
or
so
that
i
served
as
his
pastor,
i
can
truthfully
and
humbly
state
that
i
have
never
had
a
more
consecrated
or
self-sacrificing
layman
in
willard
uphaus.
he
was
on
call
for
deeds
of
kindness
and
mercy,
a
veritable
(inaudible)
whenever
i
as
pastor
called
on
him.
anyone
who
dares
--
anyone
who
dares
say
that
he
uses
religion,
his
religion
as
a
cover-up
for
his
social
concern
is
a
liar
and
the
truth
is
not
in
him.
i
wish
the
christian
church
had
100
men
as
deeply
spiritual
and
devoted
as
willard
uphaus.”
and
similar
tributes
are
paid
by
the
two
other
pastors
of
the
methodist
church
under
whom
he
has
served
as
a
layman.
a
second
thing
that
i'm
amazed
at
is
that
the
attorney
general
says
that
he
would
not
give
the
names
that
he
obtained
in
such
an
investigation,
but
he
has
given
them.
willard
uphaus
was
clearly
right
when
he
was
reluctant
to
give
these
names
to
the
attorney
general
because
here
they
are
published
in
a
report
to
the
legislature.
and
on
page
165
--
155
of
this
report
are
listed
the
names
of
people
who
were
representatives
from
foreign
governments,
preachers,
college
professors
without
any
indication
why
they're
listed
here.
and
yet,
under
the
parlance
of
today,
these
men
had
been
cited
in
new
hampshire
and
the
attorney
general
in
the
proceedings
admitted
that
there's
a
--
a
list,
a
card
index
exchanged
between
the
37
attorney
generals
throughout
the
united
states.
and
these
people
coming
here
to
register,
at
a
public
camp
where
nothing
was
concealed,
where
the
attorney
general
was
personally
welcome
to
camp
and
i
think
perhaps
did
have
a
representative
because
i
don't
know
how
else
he
knew
about
that
little
incident
about
the
“god
bless
the
revolution.”
this
camp
which
was
open
to
everybody
and
not
at
all
conspiratorial
in
its
nature,
the
names
of
these
people
that
he
wants
to
give
so
that
they
may
be
circulated
are
cited.
and
willard
uphaus
says,
“i
have
been
moved
first
by
my
religious
convictions,
by
my
inner
conscience,
by
the
direct
teachings
of
the
bible
that
it's
wrong
to
bear
false
witness
against
my
neighbor.”
i
am
also
completely
at
a
lost
as
to
why
the
communist
party
is
continually
brought
into
the
state.
it
is
not
a
fact
to
me,
your
honors
will
find
it
not
to
be
the
fact
from
the
reading
of
the
record
that
anybody
who
was
ever
--
who
is
--
was
shown
to
be
a
communist
was
present
and
certainly
willard
uphaus
testified
that
there
was
nothing
taught
there
about
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence,
not
even
about
marxism
that
they
talked
about
peace
and
about
social
problems.
and
the
attorney
general
tries
to
distinguish
the
decision
in
sweezy
on
very
narrow
grounds.mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
an
opinion
stating
the
importance
of
academic
freedom.
and
the
attorney
general
would
limit
that
to
something
in
a
university,
but
academic
freedom
is
--
he
speaks
of
in
a
psychotic
sense.
this
was
a
camp
where
the
adult
education
was
carried
on.
my
time
i
reserved
a
little
more
time
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
for
my
speech
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
see
the
light
is
on
so
i
think
i
will
continue
for
a
few
minutes
more
in
the
morning
if
i
may.
mr.
royal
w.
france
thanks.
mr.
royal
w.
france
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
royal
w.
france
on
page
99
of
the
record,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
new
hampshire,
they
state
--
it
appears
that
the
witness,
while
he
does
not
claim
contention
here,
has
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
when
questioned
about
communist
matters
at
congressional
committee
and
he
was
a
supporter
of
numerous
organizations
on
the
subversive
list
prepared
by
the
house
committee
and
so
forth.
the
--
when
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
appellant
had
ever
taken
the
fifth
amendment
anywhere
and
that
if
he
had
taken
it,
it
was
improper
to
draw
any
such
inferences
from
it.
the
matter
was
deleted
from
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
on
motion
for
rehearing.
however,
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
attorney
general
here
again
relies
upon
it
as
a
basis
for
some
implication
about
willard
uphaus
as
an
indication
of
how
thin
the
case
is
upon
which
he
is
seeking
to
rely
on
and
indicating
a
dangerous
tendency
to
waterdown
a
recognized
constitutional
right.
the
--
in
the
matter
of
the
sheriff's
list,
the
right
of
the
sheriff
to
get
names
of
guests
is
perfectly
obvious
that
that
has
no
application
here.
a
sheriff
would
not
go
to
get
the
names
of
guests
for
the
purpose
of
publicizing
name
in
an
invidious
manner
in
relation
to
subversive
activities
or
alleged
subversive
activities.
it's
inconceivable
that
he
can
use
them
for
such
purpose
and
i'm
trying
to
think
he
could
be
restrained
if
he
tried
to
do
it
for
any
such
purposes.
they're
being
used
here
in
connection
with
territory
involving
first
amendment
rights.
the
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
yesterday
was
interested
in
the
reference
on
page
42
of
appellee's
brief
to
a
name
of
julio
curry.
this
list,
which
the
attorney
general
presents
to
this
court,
some
of
the
known
off-sided
guests
and
speakers
at
world
fellowship
is
a
curious
list.
so
far
as
i
know,
julio
curry
was
never
in
this
country.
and
if
he
was,
he
certainly
was
never
at
world
fellowship
camp.
neither
was
the
liberal
journalist
i.f.
stone
who
is
disrespectfully
referred
to
here
as
busy
stone.
and
if
there
is
anything
--
he
is
a
severe
critic
of
the
soviet
union
and
louie
strong
was
never
there
nor
wasn't
at
nathaniel
mills
and
some
of
the
other
people
on
here
i'm
sure.
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
i
am
merely
referring
to
it
because
the
attorney
general
says
they
were
there.
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
think
it's
not
important
whether
they
were
there
or
not.
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
think
it
would
be
quite
irrelevant
if
julio
curry
were
there,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
if
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
don't
want
the
appellant's
position
misunderstood.
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
julio
curry
had
come
to
the
world
fellowship
to
have
him
and
asked
to
be
registered,
he
would
have
been
tediously
received
and
that
nobody
had
feared
that
the
foundations
of
government
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
were
endangered
by
his
presence.
but
the
fact
is
that
he
wasn't
there
and
justice
frankfurter
was
--
seemed
to
be
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
no,
no
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
your
honor.
what
the
court
decided
through,
i
hope
that
answered
my
question.
i
was
interested
however
in
that
set
of
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
because
you
raised
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
no,
no.
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
the
attorney
general
seems
to
me
to
have
misread
the
opinions
in
the
sweezy
case,
while
it
is
true
that
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
must
based
upon
the
vagueness
of
the
mandate.
there
was
also
discussion
of
the
first
amendment
rights
which
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
those
three
members
or
four
members
of
the
court
were
not
in
disagreement
with
the
fact
that
first
amendment
rights
here
might
have
been
violated.
and
certainly,
the
--
the
chief
justice
in
his
statement,
which
is
quoted
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
where
he
says
“we
cannot
--
we
do
not
now
conceived
of
any
circumstances
where
any
state
interest
would
justify
infringements
of
rights
in
this
field,”
indicates
to
me
clearly
that
the
attorney
general
is
trying
to
put
too
narrow
in
interpretation
upon
that
opinion.
i
think
also
that
he's
trying
to
put
too
narrow
in
interpretation
upon
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
which
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred.
i
do
not
conceive
that
in
discussing
academic
freedom,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
limiting
the
teaching
process
to
the
laws
of
a
chartered
university.
now,
that
in
discussing
political
association,
he
was
limiting
it
to
the
progressive
part.
i
think
the
issue
is
much
broader
here
with
a
camp
of
adult
people.
it's
quite
obvious
that
competent
people
came
there
as
lecturers
on
various
subjects
and
that
this
was
an
adult
educational
process
that
was
going
on.
and
i
just
can't
imagine
what
danger
there
could
have
been
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
i
may
say
that
the
attorney
general
had
a
standing
invitation
to
come
there
and
lecture
himself,
but
he
is
not
yet
honored
that
he
had
complete
opportunity,
have
a
representative
of
his
office,
attend
the
meetings
there.
there
was
nothing
secret
about
it.
it
was
an
open
discussion
by
adult
people
of
questions
of
common
interest.
and
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear,
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
the
colored
people
versus
alabama
pointed
out
that
this
appellant
had
a
right
to
protect
not
only
his
own
constitutional
rights,
but
the
rights
of
other
persons.
now,
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
expresses
the
thought
that
not
only
the
correspondence
of
guest
speakers,
but
the
correspondence
concerning
guest
speakers
was
the
subject
of
this
subpoena.
in
other
words,
here,
not
only
where
letters
which
couldn't
conceivably,
as
i
think
the
attorney
general
admitted
yesterday,
couldn't
conceivably
deal
with
the
overthrow
of
government
by
a
force
and
violence
and
nobody
would
write
such
things
in

not
only
those
letters
but
the
correspondence
that
might
be
in
the
files
by
third
or
fourth
persons
concerning
these
people.
it
seems
clear
that
this
goes
far
beyond
any

page

of
the

opinion
says,
“produce
all
correspondence
with

who

discussions
or
panel.”
this
is
a
very
wide
case
indeed
and
certainly,
it
would
seem
that
the
appellant
was
quite
justified
in
protecting
their
right
to
leave.
now
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
we
objected
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
to
all
of
it.
mr.
royal
w.
france
(voice
overlap)
constantly
that
the
subpoena
itself
was
violative
of
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
mr.
royal
w.
france
and
i
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
well,
i
--
i
think
that
was
implicit
in
various
parts
of
the
argument.
but
i
don't
remember
specifically
any
reference
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
royal
w.
france
yes,
sir.
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
consider
that
a
report
of
this
kind,
containing
the
names
of
people
or
--
(inaudible)
or
have
--
or
quite
innocent
people
that
a
report
of
this
kind
made
in
this
kind
of
an
investigation
carries
an
invidious
implication.
the
attorney
general
himself
said
that
these
names
are
send
around
through
a
network
of
37
attorney
generals.
the
fact
is
that
in
the
current
parlance,
the
fact
that
someone
has
been
cited
somewhere
becomes
a
matter
of
how
many.
every
name
here
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
well,
i
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
think
that
it's
--
the
constitutional
significance
of
it
is
that
here
is
a
--
a
man
who
is
been
--
he
is
asked
to
give
names
which
involved
the
right
of
free
speech
and
association
at
a
publicly
operated
camp.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
amendment
territory
is
invaded
by
this
kind
of
a
request
which
brings
people
into
an
invidious
association
in
a
report
made
on
the
subject
of
subversive
activities
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
--
an
area
which
this
court
has
said
should
not
be
invaded.
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
that's
right.
i
think
this
report
is
not
a
private
report
for
the
legislature.
it
went
to
the
press.
every
person's
name
there
was
--
was
cited
in
an
invidious
context.
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
no,
i
think
you
couldn't
enjoin
them,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
that's
quite
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
report
of
--
of
these
names
to
the
attorney
general,
whether
the
--
whether
the
appellant
was
justified
in
the
light
of
the
use
that
could
be
made
or
would
be
made
in
which
later
was
made
of
these
names
whether
he
was
justified
in
invoking
the
first
and
fourteen
amendments
as
a
reason
for
refusing
to
give
this
kind
of
information
for
broadcasting
in
this
context.
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
--
i
supposed
not
your
honor,
but
i
--
my
contention
is
that
there's
no
relevance
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
shown
in
this
whole
inquiry
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
to
--
to
this
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
yes,
that's
right
to
the
--
the
question
here,
the
attorney
general
was
asked
to
investigate
activities
looking
toward
the
overthrow
of
government
by
a
force
and
violence.
it
seems
to
us
that
from
the
entire
record,
his
own
entire
record,
there's
no
such
issue
in
the
--
no
such
relevant
issue
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
royal
w.
france
well,
i
--
i'm
trying
to
agree
with
you
on
that,
yes.
if
--
if
it
were
relevant
to
--
to
an
inquiry,
i
will
be
inclined
to
think
that
your
honor
was
right
about
that.
now,
as
i
--
as
i've
indicated,
there
just
isn't
any
that
the
attorney
general
has
made
a
great
deal
of
reference
to
the
so-called
communist
international
conspiracy.
there's
just
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
communist
ever
visited
the
camp.
and
as
i've
said
by
that
--
by
saying
that
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
a
communist
would
not
have
been
welcome
there,
i
just
think
the
whole
thing
is
--
is
quite
improper.
now,
i
--
if
i
have
just
one
minute
more,
your
honor,
to
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
i
have
not
indicated
the
matter
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
answer
to
what
mr.
wyman
said
about
it.
this
is
a
case
not
of
the
ordinary
requirement
for
the
production
of
a
record,
it's
the
case
of
a
man
being
asked
to
violate
his
conscience
which
is
clearly
set
forth
here
on
--
on
page
--
the
last
page
of
our
reply
brief.
we
set
forth
a
statement
by
professor
--
union
theological
company
--
seminary
as
to
the
importance
of
this
issue
of
conscience.
and
it
--
mr.
royal
w.
france
--
seems
to
us
that
to
possibly
send
the
man
to
prison
for
life
if
he
continued
to
obey
the
mandates
of
his
conscience,
would
be
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
royal
w.
france
this
is
--
he
--
he
must
either
decide
between
violating
a
conscientious
scoop
up
or
remaining
in
prison.
there's
no
alternative.
mr.
royal
w.
france
well,
it's
--
as
long
as
he
refuses,
i
should
say
that
he
would
have
to
stay
there
under
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
royal
w.
france
my
--
my
point
is
that
for
a
court
to
compel
a
man
to
make
his
choice
is
a
cruel
and
unreasonable
compulsion
put
upon
him.
