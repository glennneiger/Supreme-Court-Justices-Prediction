mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
chief
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
your
honors.
in
addition
to
the
basic
first
amendment
argument
which
was
made
in
sweezy
and
which
with
the
burden
of
dr.
france's
remarks
here,
we
present
to
your
honor
an
argument
that
are
also
made
in
sweezy,
some
refracts
the
--
on
reading
the
briefs
in
sweezy
made
much
better
by
professor
emerson
and
by
me,
namely
the
question
of
supersedure.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
under
pennsylvania
against
nelson,
that
doctrine,
the
state
power
of
inquiry
in
this
matter,
not
talking
generally,
has
not
been
superseded.
we
think
that
there
has
been
because
of
the
particular
language
of
the
statute
involved
here
and
because
of
a
particular
kind
of
inquiry
engaged
in
by
the
attorney
general.
the
inquiry
in
the
present
case
was
made
under
two
resolutions
or
statutes
of
1953
and
1955.
those
resolutions
which
appear
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
both
tie
in
the
1953
and
1955
right
of
inquiry
of
the
attorney
general
with
the
enforcement
of
the
sedition
act
of
1951.
they
provide,
these
resolutions,
that
the
attorney
general
is
to
investigate
violations
of
the
act
of
1951,
and
in
addition
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
are
subversive
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
1951
located
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
therefore,
it
would
appear
to
us
that
the
act
of
1951
if
it
was
--
it
were
invalid
under
pennsylvania
against
nelson
would
furnish
no
basis
for
the
inquiry
in
the
present
case.
the
tie
in
i
may
say
between
the
act
of
1951
and
the
investigation
of
1953
and
1955
is
virtually
conceded
and
is
set
forth
in
greater
detail
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
in
nelson
against
wyman,
another
one
of
these
investigating
cases,
which
i
have
quoted
at
pages
6
and
7
on
my
reply
brief.
now,
the
question
that
arises
of
whether
the
act
of
1951
which
we
term
is
an
act
which
has
been
superseded
under
the
doctrine
of
the
nelson
case.
it
is
an
action
which
provides
--
which
relates
in
the
preamble
that
there
is
an
existence
in
international
communist
conspiracy
directed
against
the
united
states
and
against
the
states
of
this
union
with
the
attempt
to
take
them
over
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
power.
it
provides
for
the
existence
of
seditious
persons
and
seditious
organizations
in
each
case
obviously
tying
them
to
the
world
communist
movement.
and
again,
in
nelson
against
wyman
as
your
honors
will
see
from
our
brief,
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
has
recognized
that
this
is
a
statute
dealing
with
the
same
subject
matter
as
the
statute
involved
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
except
that,
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
has
taken
the
position
both
in
nelson
against
wyman
which
are
referred
before
and
here
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
has
a
right
to
protect
itself
by
a
sedition
statute
against
this
kind
of
international
communist
movement.
it
is
essentially
a
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
asserted
with
respect
to
sedition.
a
doctrine
that
we
think
this
court
has
said
does
not
exist
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
now,
there
are
two
arguments
that
are
made
here
by
the
attorney
general
and
a
position
that's
taken
by
the
court
below
with
respect
to
the
question
of
supersedure.
the
attorney
general
suggests
without
clearly
stating
it
in
his
brief,
but
i
want
to
give
it
the
--
the
greatest
power
here
that
the
power
of
inquiry
is
not
subject
to
the
supremacy
clause.
in
other
words,
that
while
a
state
sedition
law
making
it
criminal
to
engage
in
certain
activities
would
be
superseded
or
might
be
superseded.
i
don't
want
to
make
any
contention
on
his
behalf.
a
state
power
of
inquiry
would
not
be.
now,
we
think
that
given
the
peculiar
circumstance
to
this
case,
namely,
an
inquiry
directly
predicated
upon
the
statute,
a
sedition
statute.
but
even
aside
from
the
peculiar
circumstance
of
this
case,
the
power
of
inquiry
necessarily
relates
to
the
power
to
pass
a
law.
and
if
the
state
of
new
hampshire
could
not
pass
a
state
sedition
law
validly
of
1951,
it
could
not
proceed
to
investigate
how
that
law
was
working
and
to
decide
whether
subversion
--
subversive
persons
referred
to
it
in
that
law
were
actually
in
new
hampshire.
secondly,
the
attorney
general
suggests
that
or
rather
the
--
the
attorney
general
suggests
that
pennsylvania
against
nelson
is
not
applicable
because
he
construes
that
decision
as
suspending
rather
than
as
rendering
invalid
state
sedition
laws.
now,
i
must
only
suggest
that
so
long
as
the
state
sedition
laws
are
invalid
or
are
suspended,
the
attorney
general's
power
to
investigate
is
also
either
invalid
or
suspended.
we
will
take
either
choice
because
in
either
case
would
of
course
prevent
the
power
of
inquiry
here.
now,
the
state
of
new
hampshire
through
its
supreme
court
has
made,
i
think,
a
--
a
solid
argument
but
we
think
equally
disposed
of
by
this
court's
decision
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
it
says
that
possibly,
doesn't
say
this
inquiry
with
that
kind,
that
possibly
a
state
might
find
local
sedition
which
it
could
direct
its
attention
to
by
a
valid
statute
despite
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
and
your
honor
may
--
your
honors
may
recall
the
following
pennsylvania
against
nelson,
two
state
courts,
one
in
kentucky
in
the
braden
case
and
the
other
in
massachusetts
in
the
gilbert
case,
both
dismissed,
in
one
case,
reversed
the
conviction,
dismissed
the
indictment.
the
other
case
dismissed
the
indictment
without
evidence
being
taken
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
and
in
both
those
cases
it
was
suggested
on
pursuance
that
of
course
the
court
was
not
deciding
that
in
the
speculative
situation
of
sedition
directed
against
a
state
alone,
the
state
would
be
powerless
to
act.
but
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
a
speculative
situation
but
with
a
situation
of
the
international
communist
conspiracy
as
described
in
this
statute
which
has
not
isolated
the
state
of
new
hampshire
anymore
in
the
matter
that
let
us
say
a
shays'
rebellion
isolated
massachusetts
in
1786.
we
are
dealing
with
an
international
conspiracy
as
found
by
the
various
legislatures
which
has
never
selected
one
state
or
another,
not
even
new
hampshire
and
its
special
interest.
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
new
hampshire
has
very
candidly
and
well-stated
repeatedly
in
speeches
and
in
briefs
and
in
the
sweezy
case
that
it's
impossible
to
conceive
of
sedition
against
the
state
that
is
not
related
to
sedition
against
the
united
states
in
the
modern
sense
and
vice
versa.
as
he's
read
--
said
to
your
honors
in
sweezy,
"well,
i'd
paraphrase
it
so
i
won't
repeat
it."
and
when
you
read
his
brief
in
this
case
and
his
arguments
made
to
the
court
below
and,
of
course,
through
the
printed
records,
you
will
see
that
he
is
repeatedly
pointing
out
the
importance
of
preserving
the
union
not
just
new
hampshire.
and
the
fact
that
he
relies
upon
--
at
the
attorney
general's
list
of
the
united
states
and
the
congressional
investigating
committee
hearings
which
of
course
deal
with
national
organizations
which
he
believed
to
be
subversive.
and
in
each
case,
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
is
saying
that
he
has
a
right
on
behalf
of
new
hampshire
to
aid
the
federal
government
in
connection
with
its
nationwide
sedition.
and
so,
we
say
that
treating
this
particular
statute,
the
act
of
1951,
as
a
statute
not
limited
to
new
hampshire,
recognizing
of
the
court
in
the
gilbert
case,
that
he
has
referred
to
said,
that
the
techniques
which
were
involved
are
the
familiar
paraphernalia
of
communist
agitation
for
the
overthrow
of
government
in
general
and
cannot
be
directed
separately,
and
exclusively
against
the
government
in
this
commonwealth.
and
in
gilbert,
the
indictments
refer
to
with
the
counter
indictment
related
exclusively
to
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
but
what
the
court
in
massachusetts
recognized
as
the
paraphernalia
--
the
familiar
paraphernalia
of
communist
methods
directed
against
the
nation
as
a
whole
applied
in
this
particular
case.
and
in
this
point,
i
think
i
might
rest
with
mr.
wyman's
very
succinct
statement
quoted
at
page
6
of
my
brief
when
he
said,
“national
security
is
state
security
and
state
security
is
national
security.
a
threat
to
one
is
a
threat
to
both.”
now,
i
turn
but
only
for
a
moment
because
i'm
very
anxious
for
your
honors
to
hear
mr.
--
dr.
france
in
rebuttal.
i
turn
for
a
moment
for
the
vagueness
point.
and
i
do
so
briefly
really
because
seven
members
of
this
court
have
already
stated
their
views
on
whether
the
attorney
general
acted
in
sweezy
without
due
process
because
the
mandate
of
the
legislature
in
that
case
was
too
vague.
since
seven
members
of
this
court
have
stated
the
arguments
on
both
sides
better
than
i
could
and
certainly
more
persuasively
than
i
could,
i
see
no
reason
to
add
anything
on
the
subject.
it
would
in
respect
to
the
two
members
of
the
court
who
will
read
those
opinions
and
who
were
not
participative
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
your
honor,
in
that
case,
the
concurring
opinion
disagreed
with
the
chief
justice's
opinion
which
stated
that
the
mandate
of
the
legislature
to
the
attorney
general
was
so
vague
as
not
to
indicate
what
the
attorney
general
was
to
do.
and
therefore,
there
was
a
lack
of
control
by
the
legislature
of
the
attorney
--
over
the
attorney
general.
it
was
to
that
that
i
referred.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
now,
there
is
only
one
thing
that
can
be
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
perhaps
i
was
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
perhaps
i
was
emphasizing
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
may
have
been
emphasizing
the
majority
opinion
more
than
the
concurring.
now,
there's
only
one
thing
that
can
be
added
here
in
terms
of
chronology.
and
that
is
the
argument
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
or
the
position
taken
by
the
court.
that
in
1957
the
legislature
or
general
court
of
new
hampshire
passed
a
resolution
stating
with
respect
to
dr.
sweezy
that
this
court
was
wrong
in
connection
with
the
last
point
that
i
made
about
what
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
wanted
with
respect
to
dr.
sweezy.
and
that
in
fact
the
legislature
wanted
exactly
what
mr.
wyman
has
said
it
wanted.
now
after
that,
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
resolution
related
specifically
to
dr.
sweezy.
it
was
not
considered
by
this
court
sufficient
to
overturn
the
decision
in
dr.
sweezy's
case
when
it
was
presented
to
it
upon
rehearing.
thirdly,
that
of
course
the
resolution
passed
in
1957
could
hardly
affect
our
right
in
1955
and
1956
and
the
earlier
1957
at
the
time
of
the
--
the
times
of
the
alleged
contempt
and
the
original
decisions
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
with
that
i
close
and
thank
your
honors.
