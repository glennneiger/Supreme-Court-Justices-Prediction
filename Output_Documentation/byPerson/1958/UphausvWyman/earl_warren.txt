mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
boudin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
wyman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
have
the
right
to
subpoena
all
his
correspondence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
just
said
that
after
his
infamous
career
in
other
states
of
the
union,
you
would
fee
that
you're
--
you're
involved
in
a
duty
to
--
to
investigate
him
now,
bearing
in
mind
the
so-called
infamous
career
that
he's
had.
would
you
feel
that
you
have
the
right
to
subpoena
all
of
his
correspondence,
if
he
came
into
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
just
using
your
own
words.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
chose
him
as
the
subject.
i
didn't
choose
him.
you
chose
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
because
of
his
infamous
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
background
i
suppose
in
kind
of
distinction
to
--
to
communist
background.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
you
--
knowing
what
you
do
about
him,
if
he'd
came
into
his
--
into
your
state,
would
you
feel
that
it
was
your
right
to
--
to
obtain
all
of
his
correspondence,
and
the
names
of
all
the
people
who
attended
his
gatherings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
the
correspondence,
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
would
that
depend
upon
your
sole
decision
based
upon
secret
information
or
whatever
information
you
might
have
as
to
whether
he
--
he
should
be
subjected
to
that
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
decide
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
what
do
you
base
that
on?
as
in
this
case,
do
you
not
base
it
upon
what
you
reported
to
the
legislature
in
that
red
book
that
you
just
have
before
you?
isn't
--
isn't
that
using
your
own
discretion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
could,
i
suppose
if
you
made
a
report
to
the
legislature
stating
that
--
that
your
information
was
that
he
had
known
people
of
bad
character
and
had
associated
with
people
who
have
no
known
connections,
and
you
had
made
that
report
to
the
legislature,
i
suppose
you
could
use
that
against
john
brown
just
the
same
as
you
used
it
against
mr.
uphaus,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now
--
i
--
you
--
you
considered
--
do
you
base
your
judgment
then
on
the
fact
that
--
of
that
he
should
have
his
correspondence
reviewed
here
partially
or
largely
on
the
fact
that
he
claimed
the
fifth
amendment
in
a
congressional
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
do
--
why
do
you
cite
it
to
us
if
you
do
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
that
--
does
that
mean
he
confesses
guilt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
if
you're
not
the
one
who
makes
the
decision,
now
are
you
that
i
thought
it
was
a
constitutional
right
that
a
man
could
just
take
them.
i
thought
you
could
take
it
without
--
without
it
being
a
reflection
against
him
which
would
deprive
him
of
any
rights
of
an
american
citizen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
just
wondering
why
--
why
you
--
you
cite
to
us
the
fact
mr.
uphaus
did
avail
himself
of
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
--
fifth
amendment
in
order
to
support
your
position
here,
because
you
said,
we
were
talking,
i
think
about
(inaudible)
and
you
said
if
he'd
taken
the
fifth
amendment,
this
--
mr.
uphaus
did
another
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that,
i
don't
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
understood
he
--
he
spoke
very
frankly
to
--
to
you
and
before
the
court
as
to
all
the
things
that
involved
him
personally.
it
was
only
when
--
when
it
came
to
being
an
informer
that
he
--
that
he
declined
to
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
it
equally
unlikely
that
he
would
have
those
things
in
his
possession
now
and
would
--
would
state
openly
in
court
that
he
did
have
them
and
where
he
had
them,
where
they
could
be
located
if
he
--
if
they
did
in
fact
show
anything
subversive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
could
be
without
any
restraint
on
your
part
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
just
a
matter
of
your
own
--
of
your
own
choice
if
you
would
not
do
that.
but
under
--
under
this
statute
and
with
the
power
you
have,
could
you
not
list
every
person
whose
name
was
given
to
you
by
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
who
--
who
determines
as
to
what
indiscriminate
means?is
there
anyone
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you
have
reviewed
over
a
committee
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
publishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
publishing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
haven't
you,
if
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
the
publishing.you
could
publish
anything
you
want.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
--
that's
what
i
meant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
fact
that
you
don't
do
it,
isn't
because
the
--
the
statute
raises
that
standard.
it's
merely
because
you
yourselves,
as
a
professional
matter
feel
that
you
shouldn't
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
--
i
--
i
noticed
also
that
there
were
--
that
some
of
these
people
when
we
questioned
them
every
time
there's
associations,
that
some
of
these
organizations
that
you
say
were
listed
with
the
attorney
general,
held
meetings
in
--
in
some
of
the
churches,
in
new
hampshire.
now,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
would
feel
free
under
your
--
under
this
statute
to
go
to
the
churches
and
--
and
demand
that
they
--
to
give
the
correspondence
between
them
and
the
--
and
those
who
spoke
and
--
and
also
have
the
right
to
demand
that
they
give
you
a
list
of
the
people
who
have
been
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
will
you
distinguish,
please
for
me,
between
the
churches
and
this
particular
institution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
insofar
as
your
--
your
legal
power
is
concerned.
that's
all
i'm
asking
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
have
some
--
some
churches
that
are
on
a
rather
informal
basis,
more
informal
than
others.
for
instance,
the
jehovah's
witnesses.
if
they
had
a
--
a
gathering,
would
you
feel
--
would
you
feel
that
you
had
the
right
to
do
that
or
would
do
they
have
to
have
some
form
of
church
building
and
hierarchy
or
--
or
something
else
to
indicate
that
they
were
a
religious
group?
or
--
or
what
is
the
test
that
you
would
use
to
determine
whether
you
are
interfering
with
religion
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
a
few
moments
ago
that
in
new
hampshire,
no
one
now,
admits
that
he
is
or
was
a
member
of
the
--
of
the
communist
party.
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
did
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
you
disproved
to
him
that
he
is
a
communist.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that's
a
test?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or,
you
can
just
prove
to
him
the
fact
that
he
is
a
communist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
ever
tested?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
have
you
established
anything
comparable
to
that
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
--
if
anyone
of
these
organizations
that
you
have
listed
and
that
mr.
france
went
over
has
ever
been
declared
by
any
--
any
court
to
be
a
subversive
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
any
judicial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
determination
and
if
any
of
these
--
any
of
these
been
determined
to
be
subversive
organizations.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
you
don't
list
him
here
as
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
--
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
equivalent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
went
looking
here.
i
--
i
thought
i
remembered
something
in
this
record
which
i
read
yesterday
to
the
effect
that
you
stated
that
you
thought
that
--
that
any
man
who
had
had
any
association
with
communist
or
reputed
communists
should
be
subject
to
investigation.
now,
i
--
i
may
--
i
may
have
--
maybe
misquote
you
but
that's
the
recollection
that
i
have.
am
i
incorrect
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
the
record
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
wouldn't
have
to
disagree
with
you
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
--
on
that
question.
now,
how
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
say
communists
from
all
over
the
world.
is
there
--
is
there
any
finding,
any
place
in
this
record
that
any
of
these
people
are
communists?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
talk
about
reputed
communist?
yes,
that's
--
that's
something
very
common
these
days
to
call
people
communists.
chief
justice
earl
warren
matusow
and
some
others
called
a
lot
people
communists,
too,
but
as
it
is
they're
very
much
respected
today
as
informers,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
was
talking
about
was
--
was
to
prove.
establish
proof,
of
course.
in
fact,
if
someone
testified
that
--
that
way
doesn't
--
couldn't
bear
much
the
basis
for
investigating
someone
else
because
he
happens
to
be
in
the
same
vicinity
with
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
france.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
you
have
some
15
minutes
more
