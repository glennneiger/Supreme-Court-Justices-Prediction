mr.
lester
m.
ponder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
refer
at
this
time
to
two
statements
that
were
made
--
have
been
made
by
the
counsel
for
the
government
which
are
on
my
mind.
one
is
that
it
has
been
a
long
established
administrative
practice
to
treat
the
accruals
as
the
government
contends
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
first
on
that
point,
the
administrative
ruling
to
which
counsel
refers
was
not
issued
until
1957
long
after
this
question
was
deeply
in
litigation
in
the
lower
courts.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
commissioner
has
never
seen
fit
to
embody
this
position
in
regulations
either
under
the
1939
code
or
more
lately
under
the
1954
code.
and
we
submit
that
if
the
commissioner
felt
strongly
as
to
the
correctness
of
this
administrative
position,
he
would
have
embodied
it
in
a
regulation
carrying
the
weight
of
a
regulation
and
not
of
a
ruling,
which,
of
course,
it
does
not
have
the
standing
on
regulation,
secondly,
on
the
point
just
made
as
to
the
accrual
point
of
the
later
deduction.
i
believe
it
is
safe
to
say
that
a
search
of
all
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
involving
the
proper
year
of
accrual
of
items,
of
income
or
deductions
in
the
lower
courts
without
exception
and
that
includes
two
cases,
i
think
the
most
recent
cases
of
this
court
on
the
accrual
question
which
have
not
been
referred
to,
those
are
the
dixie
pine
products
and
the
security
flour
mills
cases
which
are
cited,
of
course,
in
the
brief
in
1944.
and
in
none
of
those
cases,
i
submit,
has
this
court
eluded
to
or
ever
referred
to
any
later
offset
or
credit
as
having
any
possible
effect
on
the
year
of
accrual
but
the
test
being
as
annunciated
in
the
spring
city
case
and
as
reiterated
in
all
the
later
cases
that
is
the
right
to
income
which
becomes
fixed
in
the
year
which
was
determined
to
question.
the
offset
to
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
excuse
me.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
let
me
say
this,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
it
was
never
put
in
the
regulations
in
1957
and
has
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
the
ruling,
a
revenue
ruling.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
there
was
no
change
in
the
treatment
accorded
by
the
commissioner
when
the
question
arose
as
to
how
taxpayers
treated
it
in
that
interim
period,
i
cannot
say.
in
other
words,
the
1931
ruling
was
--
what
is
known
as
a
gcm,
which
is
the
general
counsel's
memorandum
so-called
at
that
time.
frequently,
as
you
know,
taxpayers
do
not
see
fit
to
follow
inferior
administrative
rulings
but
preferring
to
litigate
those
rulings
if
they
feel
they
are
incorrect.
now,
as
--
answering
your
question,
as
far
as
i
know,
there
was
no
change
in
this
general
view
of
the
commissioner
during
that
period.
but
as
i
say,
he
failed
to
give
this
position
the
dignity
and
standing
of
a
regulation
even
though
from
the
year,
i
say,
1948
to
the
present,
this
question
has
been
litigated
time
and
time
again
but
no
changes
--
but,
as
i
say,
no
regulation
was
issued
on
the
point.
i
called
the
court's
attention
briefly
to
an
error
in
printing
on
page
9
of
the
brief.
i
do
not
think
it
is
material.
but
in
the
line
on
that
page
in
a
tabulation
entitled
financing
charge
paid
to
finance
company
$420,
that
amount
should
be
$1265.80
as
it
appears
on
page
18
of
the
record
which
is
given
as
the
reference
there,
that
is
there
is
no
confusion
if
the
record
is
checked
but
it's
simply
in
the
printing
there
was
a
transposition
because
that
figure
had
appeared
earlier
in
the
tabulation.
i
simply
call
that
to
the
court's
attention.
now,
i
will
endeavor
not
to
repeat
the
basic
accrual
points
which
have
already
been,
i
think,
very
amply
covered
by
preceding
counsel.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
however,
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
the
baird
case
that
their
rights
to
income
where
even
more
contingent
during
the
taxable
years
than
those
of
the
automobile
dealers.
why?
why
do
i
say
that?
first
place,
automobile
sales,
of
course,
have
been
financed
by
finance
companies
organized
especially
for
that
purpose
over
a
period
of
many
years,
30
or
35
years
or
longer,
whereas
the
baird
case
involves
mobile
homes
which
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
house
trailers
rather
than
automobiles
as
in
the
hansen
and
glover
cases
just
argued.
house
trailers
were
of
comparatively
small
use
prior
to
world
war
ii
but
with
the
wartime
housing
shortage,
the
need
for
itinerant
workers
and
other
such
causes,
the
house
trailer
industry
began
to
increase
greatly
about
1945.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
now
estimated
that
about
3,500,000
persons
live
in
about
1,200,000
house
trailers
at
this
time.
and
in
1948
--
excuse
me,
1958
last
year
for
every
100
houses
started,
14
new
house
trailers
were
manufactured
to
show
the
growth,
the
growth
of
the
industry.
now,
what
significance
does
that
have
on
our
case?
we
think
it
has
this
significance
that
the
trailer
dealers,
like
the
automobile
dealers
before
them,
were
unable
to
finance
their
sales
and
had
to
turn
to
outside
financial
institutions
for
this
service.
but
the
established
automobile
finance
companies
apparently
had
no
interest
in
this
business.
consequently,
the
few
institutions
which
would
agree
to
furnish
financing
were
in
a
bargaining
position
which
permitted
them
to
incorporate
very
stringent
terms
governing
the
retail
dealers
such
as
the
baird's
and
their
rights
to
the
amounts
credited.
now,
why
did
they
have
this
difference
between
the
trailers
and
automobiles?
several
facts
quickly
show
it.
one
is
that
there
was
a
very
long
credit
period
for
trailers
as
compared
to
automobiles.
it
would
run
from
three
to
seven
years
as
compared
to
an
average
of
perhaps
two
and
one
half
years
for
automobiles.
secondly,
trailers
cost
more
than
automobiles
in
the
nature
of
the
product.
they
will
average
from
$5000
to
$8000
in
price
compared
to
automobile
prices
during
our
period,
and
i
quickly
say
this
was
several
years
ago
before
prices
are
as
high
as
now
when
the
automobiles
would
be
between,
say,
$2500
and
$4000
for
the
average
car.
the
third
factor
that
made
the
house
trailer
dealers
in
a
very
poor
position
to
arrange
financing
was
the
transient
and
impermanent
nature
of
the
majority
of
trailer
purchasers
compared
to
automobile
owners.
now,
only
two
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
had
occasion
to
consider
the
identical
question
that
is
involved
in
the
baird
case
on
these
facts.
they
are
the
blaine
johnson
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
texas
trailer-coach
case
in
the
fifth
circuit.
i
submit
that
the
facts
in
all
three
cases
are
identical
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
government
contends
to
the
contrary.
during
this
period,
we
have
an
additional
complication
in
our
case
that
is
not
present
in
the
hansen
and
glover
case,
that
is
complication
on
the
facts.
mr.
baird
and
mrs.baird,
as
partners,
did
business
during
this
period
with
three
separate
finance
companies.
well,
of
course,
each
one
drove
a
separate
bargain.
they
are
all
in
the
record.
most
of
those
agreements
were
in
writing.
there
were
some
oral
bases
which
are
in
the
record
in
two
of
the
three
agreements.
but
the
basic
agreement
and
the
one
to
which
i
want
to
refer
chiefly
was
with
minnehoma
financial
company
of
tulsa,
oklahoma
and
that
was
entirely
in
writing
and,
of
course,
is
in
the
record.
i
believe
it's
at
page
--
starting
at
page
27.
now,
during
this
taxable
period,
the
baird's,
as
i
say,
assigned
their
contracts
and
i
want
to
point
this
out
to
that
contrary
to
a
statement
yesterday
which
i'm
sure
was
simply
a
slip
on
the
part
of
counsel
for
the
respondent,
in
minnehoma,
there
was
no
note
but
in
the
other
two
midland
and
michigan,
the
other
two
companies,
did
have
notes.
we
do
not
think
that
is
material.
i
simply
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
so
the
court
will
understand
that
in
the
minnehoma,
there
was
no
note.
there
was
simply
the
conditional
sales
contract.
now,
i
will,
for
purposes
of
the
gravity
of
time
allotted
me,
refer
solely
to
the
details
of
the
minnehoma
agreement
for
this
reason.
the
minnehoma
agreement,
of
the
three
agreements
involved
in
the
baird
case,
is
the
only
one
that
is
common
to
the
three
cases
involving
trailer
dealers,
that
is
blaine
johnson
in
the
fourth
circuit,
texas
trailer-coach
in
the
fifth
and
the
baird
case.
therefore,
since
it's
as
a
common
contract,
and
i'd
like
--
like
to
just
simply
stress
that
one
contract.
and,
of
course,
as
i
have
said
that's
at
record
27
in
toto
and
another
reason
for
referring
to
that
one
is
that
it
was
entirely
in
writing.
now,
under
that
contract,
what
were,
what
were
the
limitations
on
the
baird's
that
made
their
rights
to
these
credited
amounts
so
contingent
that
we
contend
they
were
not
accruable
in
the
years
of
the
sales
of
the
trailers?
first,
the
trailer
purchaser
must
complete
a
credit
form
supplied
by
minnehoma.
minnehoma
supplied
the
credit
form.
the
dealer
had
to
forward
this
in
two
copies
of
either
at
dun
&
bradstreet
or
a
retail
merchant's
credit
report
to
minnehoma.
and
minnehoma
had
to
approve
the
purchaser's
credit
before
there
could
be
any
sale.
secondly,
each
trailer
contract
had
to
be
on
a
printed
form
provided
by
minnehoma,
in
which
the
name,
of
course,
minnehoma
is
inserted
therein
at
the
appropriate
places
as
will
be
shown
in
the
record.
thirdly,
the
balance
owed
by
the
purchaser
is
payable
only
at
the
minnehoma
office
in
tulsa
and
if,
by
any
chance,
it
should
be
paid
to
the
dealer,
he
has
to
immediately
forward
these
under
very
stringent
conditions
on
that.
next,
minnehoma
designated
the
amount
of
the
down
payment.
fifthly,
the
dealer
unconditionally
guaranteed
minnehoma
against
any
losses
including
loss
of
prospective
profits.
that's
the
wording
of
the
agreement,
“prospective
profits”.
this
guarantee,
therefore,
covers
much
more
than
the
5%
holdback.
it
covers
insurance
premiums
for
the
full-term.
if
the
--
if
the
purchaser
would
prepay,
still
baird
was
liable
only
full-term
insurance
premium,
same
way
with
finance
charges.
they
guaranteed
full-term
finance
charges,
prospective
profits.
so
you
can
see
that
baird's
reserve
was
subject
to
being
reduced
by
much
more
than
the
5%,
not
only
that
involved
but
these
other
factors.
and
that,
of
course,
is
pointed
out
in
detail
at
page
19
of
the
brief.
now,
what
does
baird
get
back?
the
contract
says
this,
“an
amount
to
be
determined,
to
be
determined
by
minnehoma
from
time
to
time
in
its
absolute
discretion,
equal
to
not
more
than
5%”.
not
just
5%,
equal
to
not
more
than
5%.
but
the
total
purchase
price
would
be
credited
by
minnehoma.
payments,
when
do
they
be
made?
they
are
to
be
made
only
from
time
to
time
as
determined
by
minnehoma.
then
in
addition
to
this
holdback
reserve
credit,
minnehoma
may,
but
it
doesn't
have
to,
credit
the
partnership
with
a
portion
of
the
finance
charge
of
matter
solely
within
the
discretion
of
minnehoma.
and
then,
of
course,
if
that
is
done,
that
credit,
of
course,
becomes
subject
to
the
same
contingencies
governing
the
hold
--
the
holdback,
as
i've
already
outlined.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
--
to
another
provision
this
contract,
we
think,
makes
baird's
rights
extremely
contingent.
minnehoma's
determination
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
contingent
liability
shall
be
filed
and
not
subject
to
question
by
the
dealer.
and
how
could
that
be
written
any
stronger,
i
submit?
thirdly
or
i
should
say
further,
minnehoma
could
reassign
any
contract
upon
such
terms
as
--
and
conditions
as
minnehoma
should
determine
and
even
if
they
did
that
without
baird
having
anything
to
say
about
it,
they
didn't
waive
their
rights
against
baird,
expressly
in
the
contract
and
then
such
as
her
niece
would
succeed
to
all
of
minnehoma's
rights
against
baird.
now,
as
i
say,
these
identical
facts
were
before
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
johnson
case
and
they
were
before
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
texas
trailer-coach
case.
in
johnson,
there
were
other
contracts
also
which,
as
we
say,
just
as
we
had
other
contracts,
we
think
that
fundamentally,
they
were
of
the
same
general
nature
but,
of
course,
differed
in
their
precise
wording.
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
the
court
made
an
error
in
failing
to
perceive
the
identical
factual
situation
between
the
two
cases
because
there
is
a
reference
in
the
opinion
of
that
court
to
a
possible
deviation
between
the
facts
where
the
court
states
in
the
last
paragraph
of
its
opinion,
“ignoring
some
of
the
factual
differences,”
the
court
said,
“we
decline
to
follow
if
--
all
the
same
rather,
“we
decline
to
follow
johnson
and
texas
trailer-coach”.
i
submit
there
are
no
factual
differences
and
that
that
error
caused
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit
to
be
contrary
to
these
petitioners.
the
reason,
as
i
say,
that
i
say
the
facts
are
the
same,
it
was
stipulated
in
the
tax
court
trial
of
the
baird
case
that
the
entire
blaine
johnson
record
was
received
in
evidence
in
the
baird
case.
how
could
the
facts
be
different
on
that
stipulation?
secondly,
in
the
--
in
the
texas
trailer-coach
case,
the
only
finance
company
involved
was
minnehoma.
the
contract
was
in
evidence,
the
agreements
were
in
evidence
and,
of
course,
they
were
identical
with
the
agreements
in
the
baird
case
because
minnehoma
had
drawn
up
a
set
of
agreements
and
contracts
which
it
used
uniformly
with
trailer
dealers.
and
in
any
event,
they
are
identical
and
our
comparison
shows
that.
now,
the
basic
accrual
principles
coming
to
those
points,
as
i
say
i
will
not
dwell
at
length
because
i
think
they
have
been
covered.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
has
been
held
on
several
occasions
that
a
strained
construction
in
administrative
efforts
to
accrue
income
should
be
avoided.
and
we
submit
that
the
position
here
of
the
respondent
is
an
extremely
strained
effort
to
accrue
income
regardless
of
what
else
may
be
said.
i
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
dixie
pine
products
case
and
the
security
flour
mills
case
of
this
court
in
1944,
mr.
justice
black
said
that
the
right
to
income
--
excuse
me,
when
the
right
to
income
has
become
final
and
definite
in
amount,
then
the
income
is
to
be
accrued.
and
i
think
that
in
some
of
the
discussions
on
this
point,
those
cases
have
been
overlooked.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
those
cases
which,
of
course,
cited
in
the
brief.
we
feel
that
we
have
shown
that
substantial
contingencies
govern
the
petitioner's
rights
to
the
amounts
credited.
they
were,
of
course,
clearly
unavailable
to
the
petitioner's
in
any
sense
during
the
tax
years
involved
whether
they
would
ever
be
available
was
uncertain
during
the
taxable
years
because
of
this
wide
control
of
the
finance
companies
over
the
credited
amounts.
and
as
i
have
already
pointed
out,
the
respondent
has
never
challenged
the
similarity
in
effect
of
the
three
finance
companies
that
we
have
involved
in
this
case.
so,
of
course,
as
time
won't
permit,
i
won't
go
into
the
others
except
to
say
that
they
are
substantially
similar.
now,
with
respect
to
this
one
or
two
transactions
hypothesis,
of
course,
we
say
under
the
decided
cases
of
that
there
simply
was
one
transaction
here.
the
--
that
was
so
held
expressly
in
those
words
in
johnson
and
expressly
in
texas
trailer-coach,
and
our
facts
are
identical.
and
we
say
that
only
that
result
can
obtain
here.
we
say
that
further
in
its
brief,
the
respondent
states
on
pages
40
and
41
that
regardless
of
whether
this
court
holds
a
one
or
two
transaction
hypothesis,
the
tax
result
must
be
the
same.
so
curiously
enough,
we
find
respondent
arguing
in
this
court
that
there
are
two
transactions
and
it's
saying
the
brief
that
it
makes
no
difference.
now,
quickly
as
to
the
finance
company
being
a
party,
we
think
in
treat
and
in
fact
it
was
a
party.
from
texas
trailer-coach,
we
find
this
language.
a
trailer
dealer
has
little
hope
of
opinion
financing
unless
he
agrees
to
the
establishment
of
a
reserve
account.
its
existence
means
life
or
death
to
the
trailer
business.
and
again,
from
blaine
johnson
in
the
fourth
circuit,
those
few
financial
institutions
which
would
finance
this
paper
were
able
to
dictate
to
the
trailer
dealers
the
terms
on
which
they
would
do
so.
in
view
of
these
facts,
we
feel
that
our
position
should
be
sustained.
and
i
would
like
to
say
again
that
curiously
here,
the
respondent
also
has
departed
from
his
historic
position
and
the
historic
position
of
this
court
as
exemplified
by
the
clifford
case,
the
horse
case
and
many
others
in
arguing
what
we
feel
is
a
hyper
technical
argument
which
glorifies
form
instead
of
the
substance
of
the
transaction
which,
of
course,
is
well
established
to
be
the
guiding
tax
principle.
if
i
have
any
further
time,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
it.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
if
the
court
please.
just
two
comments,
i
believe,
here.
one
is
again,
on
the
two-transaction
hypothesis,
it
is
my
belief
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
on
the
two
transaction
point
was
based
primarily
on
taking
certain
testimony
of
mr.
baird
out
of
context
and
attributing
to
it
a
meaning
which
did
not
exist,
that
is
to
say
in
testimony
on
cross-examination,
he
was
asked
if
when
the
trailer
purchaser
came
to
his
place
of
business,
the
purchaser
knew
what
finance
company
was
going
to
handle
the
transaction.
well,
of
course,
he
said
no.
but
the
other
evidence
shows
that
before
the
sale
was
completed,
the
purchaser
knew
the
identity
of
the
finance
company.
as
i
say
if,
for
no
other
reasons,
than
that
in
the
contract
itself,
the
finance
company
name
was
set
forth,
the
payment
place
to
be
at
that
location
and
many
other
such
points.
but
the
court
apparently,
as
i
say,
i
think
in
error,
seized
on
that
one
statement
out
of
context
that
when
he
walked
in
his
place
of
business
and
picked
out
the
trailer,
of
course,
he
didn't
know
at
that
time,
he
wanted
a
model,
a
certain
model
at
a
certain
price,
only
later
when
they
discussed
terms
and
his
credit
was
approved
by
the
finance
company.
of
course,
before
the
sale
was
completed,
then,
of
course,
the
purchaser
did
know.
so
as
i
say,
i
think
that
was
the
crux
of
the
erroneous
holding
on
the
two-transaction
point
if
that
is
important
in
this
case.
secondly,
again
referring
quickly
--
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
feel
i
should
spend
more
time
on
the
point
because
of
their
position
in
--
in
that
regard.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
yes,
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
lester
m.
ponder
that's
correct.
i'm
simply
trying
to
explain
why
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
did
go
off
on
a
tangent
if
that
should
be
important.
that's
my
only
point
on
that.
secondly,
i
want
to
point
out
again
that
this
administrative
ruling
in
1957,
again,
does
not
have
the
standing,
in
our
opinion,
to
which
respondent
attributes
because
it
simply
is
a
restatement
of
their
argument
before
this
court
and
before
all
the
courts
of
appeal
and
before
the
tax
court.
it's
just
nothing
more
than
a
restatement
in
a
more
elaborate
form
on
certain
points.
but
the
point
is
it
is
not
of
the
standing,
of
course,
of
a
regulation.
now,
we'd
like
to
point
out
here,
as
i've
already
done,
i'd
like
to
say
that
there
is
much
more
here
than
the
debtor
not
satisfying
his
indebtedness,
as
i
pointed
out.
baird
was
liable
for
loss
of
prospective
profits,
for
example,
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
debtor
not
satisfying
his
indebtedness.
it's
--
it's
just
the
opposite.
if
he
has
satisfied
it
early,
that
caused
baird
to
be
liable
under
that
provision.
then
in
conclusion,
i
would
say,
your
honors,
that
as
i
understand
respondent's
argument,
he
is
asking
this
court
to
establish
a
new
rule
of
accrual
something
that
might
be
called
the
possible
later
offsetting
tax
benefit
theory.
this
court
has
never
adopted
such
a
view.
and
we
submit
that
the
established
accrual
principles
governed
this
case
and
require
decision
for
the
petitioners.
i
thank
you.
