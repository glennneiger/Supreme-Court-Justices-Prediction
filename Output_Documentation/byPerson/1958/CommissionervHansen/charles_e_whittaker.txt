justice
charles
e.
whittaker
excuse
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
in
some
instances,
they
will
be
transferred
without
recourse?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
under
the
contract
(inaudible)
obligations?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
they're
separate
collateral
agreements?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
a
way
to
make
clear
what
i
had
in
mind
that
they
found
at
least
two
points
of
the
contract,
one
is
the
contract
between
the
seller
and
the
buyer
of
the
car,
and
the
other
part
of
it
is
a
form
for
constable
use
in
the
event
of
the
sale
of
securities
evidenced
in
deferred
payment.
and
in
some
instances,
you
have
occurred
document
to
render
notes
or
maybe
a
chattel
mortgage
or
something
he
could
use.
isn't
that
what
--
is
that
not
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
the
amount
of
the
reserve
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
understand
you
to
argue
that
because
(inaudible)
to
say
you
made
some
interest
in
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
they
doing
the
(inaudible)
the
contracts
between
the
dealer
and
the
purchaser
of
the
automobile
and
(inaudible)
that
you
can
sell
the
notes
as
payable
to
your
client?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then,
i
would
like
(inaudible)
what
is
the
difficulty
in
bringing
(inaudible)
in
the
situation
where
(inaudible)
to
sell
the
note
to
the
finance
company
for
its
face
amount
and,
then,
under
some
collateral
(inaudible)
by
the
dealer
who
is
selling
(inaudible)
requirements
of
his
undertaking
in
that
collateral
(inaudible)
do
you
understand
what
i'm
asking
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
a
difference?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
understand
--
i
understand
your
logic,
but
what
if
i
go
into
the
facts
even
though
there
will
be
$1000
as
to
that
(inaudible)
and
i
endorse
that
you
agreed
to
it
and
i
endorse
it
in
blank.
(inaudible)
what
they
say
as
the
condition
of
agreement,
we
asked
you
to
pledge
with
us,
under
a
collateral
agreement,
some
amount
of
money
to
secure
the
requirements
of
any
liability
it
may
have
as
endorser.
now,
then,
have
i
not
received
the
full
purchase
price
of
the
notes
and
then
taken
from
that
fund
or
some
other
funds,
money
required
by
the
bank
and
deposited
with
them
your
obligations
as
endorser?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
true,
mr.
miller,
every
bank
to
allow
the
agreement
to
--
that
you
know
anything
about
or,
at
least
it
seems
to
me,
that
i
know
anything
about
that
if
i
put
up
money
or
collaterals
under
a
collateral
agreement
with
a
bank
to
ensure
obligations
that
may
accrue
against
me
on
notes
of
conditional
sales
contracts
i
have
transferred
to
the
bank,
then,
at
the
end
of
the
transaction,
what
has
not
been
properly
deducted
from
this
collateral
deposit
i
have
made
necessarily
comes
back
to
me
because
it's
always
been
mine
and
it's
been
simply
pledged
as
collateral
to
secure
my
obligation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
isn't
that
the
question
for
decision?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
contract
between
the
--
by
that
statement,
you
mean,
the
contract
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
one
that
preceded
this
--
the
sale
in
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
would
you
state
the
citation
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

justice
charles
e.
