mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
distinct
cases
here
and,
because
of
that
fact,
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
particular
facts
in
the
cases.
however,
before
going
to
the
distinguishing
or
different
facts
in
the
glover
case,
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court's
attention
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
issue
here.
yesterday,
counsel
for
the
commissioner
has
argued
and
questioned
from
the
court
today
indicate
that
there
are
some
concern
over
the
face
amount
of
the
note
originally
signed
by
the
customer.
and,
i
--
the
government,
in
brief,
has
intermitted
if
not
alleged
that
some
portion
of
that
has,
by
these
dealers,
been
sought
to
be
omitted
from
income.
and,
at
least
in
the
glover
case,
i
wish
to
set
clear
the
fact
that
the
statutory
notice
in
that
case
which
set
this
proceeding
underway
refers
only
to
the
reserve
which
is
set
up
under
a
contract
between
the
finance
company
and
the
dealer.
that
is
all
that
was
alleged
to
have
been
omitted,
a
portion
of
that
reserve.
that
reserve
is
something
completely
separate
from
a
part
of
the
price
over
here.the
service
charge
or
finance
charge,
if
you
would
call
it
that,
or
carrying
charge
or
interest
charged
to
the
customer
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
contract
agreed
finance
withheld
--
financing
charge
withheld
or
reserve
by
the
finance
company.
it's
not
the
same
thing,
although
they
may
be
part,
and
we
allege
they
all
are
part,
of
one
intrical
transaction.
they
are
not
identical.
and,
in
its
--
in
his
petition,
mr.
glover
referred
only
to
the
reserve
and
alleged
that
the
commissioner
had
erred
in
seeking
to
tax
the
entire
reserve,
the
amount
he
was
entitled
to
collect,
as
well
as
the
amount
which
he
had
no
right
to
collect.
so,
the
only
issue
involved
in
the
glover
case
is
this
portion
of
the
reserve
which
is
referred
to
as
the
amount
under
3%
of
total
outstanding
notes
of
this
dealer.
that
part
was
omitted
from
the
tax
return
and
was
deferred.
not
only
is
the
amount
of
the
price
charged
to
the
customer,
the
credit
price
or
the
total
credit
prices
for
the
entire
calendar
year
involved,
not
only
are
they
not
in
issue,
they're
not
in
evidence.
and,
there
is
no
amount
of
customer
price
that
can
be
litigated
in
the
glover
case.
the
only
amount
is,
and
i
would
refer
to
the
record
at
page
--
the
glover
record
at
page
10
and
point
out
what
the
government
disallowed
in
--
that
started
this
case
under
little
a
--
under
schedule
1a,
explanation
of
adjustments.
in
your
return
for
the
taxable
year,
$8026.85
in
finance
reserve
was
included
in
the
net
profit.
it
--
and,
skipping
down,
the
$8000
somewhat
represented
a
portion
of
$11,000
credited
on
the
books
of
the
finance
company,
less
the
$3885
which
is
the
reserve
which,
we
contend,
we're
not
entitled
to.
it
has
been
determined
that,
in
as
much
as
you
reported
income
on
an
accrual
basis,
the
entire
amount
is
now
reportable,
the
additional
$3885.71.
i
submit
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
original
credit
price
on
the
original
notes
signed
by
the
customers
of
glover
in
any
of
these
taxable
years.
so,
the
issue
is
really,
is
glover
to
be
taxed
on
the
amount
of
the
reserve
which
is
withheld
under
the
contract?
now,
turning
to
the
distinguishing
facts
in
the
glover
case,
there
is
only
one
finance
contract
and
it
is
in
evidence.
it
is
with
c.i.t.
credit
corporation.
and,
under
that
contract,
which
is
printed
in
full
at
record
page
33
--
23,
i'm
sorry,
under
that
contract,
glover
assigned
his
notes
without
recourse
with
respect
to
all,
except
commercial
cars.
and,
at
page
24,
you
will
see
that
glover
received
from
the
finance
company
not
the
entire
amount
as
was
stated
by
government
counsel
yesterday.
it
was
stated
that
he
received
the
entire
amount
with
the
exception
of
the
reserve.
but,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
finance
company,
of
course,
makes
something
o
these
transactions.
the
face
amount
of
a
note
is
already
signed
by
the
customer.the
note
is
assigned
without
recourse.
at
paragraph
4,
the
language
appears
you're
--
that
c.i.t.
rate
charges
will
include,
for
our
protection,
reserves
as
outline
in
your
reserve
arrangement,
effective
at
the
time
paper
is
purchased
by
you.
now,
that
provides
for
a
variable
reserve
which
is
withheld
from
the
dealer
at
the
instance
of
c.i.t.and
solely
under
its
control.
and
so,
that
would
vary
according
to
the
value
of
money
or
to
whatever
charge
they
wanted
to
place
on
the
dealer.
probably,
it
was
affected
by
his
bargaining
power,
his
credit
rating.
but,
it
was
variable.
however,
the
dealer's
right
to
a
portion
of
this
reserve
remained
constant
throughout
these
years
and
provided
that
three
times
in
each
12-month
period,
if
we
are
not
then
indebted
to
you,
you,
c.i.t.,
will
pay
us
our
accumulated
reserves
in
excess
of
3%
of
the
then
aggregate
unpaid
balances
on
paper
purchased
from
us.
now,
lets
again
see
what
the
real
issue
is.
3%
of
the
aggregate
unpaid
balances
of
all
notes
then
payable
under
this
arrangement,
the
court
should
understand
that
this
includes
notes
from
last
year
and,
possibly,
the
year
before,
as
well
as
the
current
year.
once
that
portion
of
the
reserve
is
placed
in
the
pot,
so
to
speak,
the
retained
reserve,
it
becomes
--
it
loses
its
identity
and
it's
affected
not
by
a
particular
customer
who's
paying
his
account,
but
by
all
customers
that
pay
their
accounts
and
by
all
new
sales
which
a
caused
an
increase
in
the
outstanding
notes
of
glover,
so
that
this
issue
refers
to
an
amount
which
arises
not
only
in
the
current
year,
but
from
accumulated
transactions
in
prior
years.
it
should
be
pointed
out
also
that
this
contract
to
which
i
have
referred
in
the
record
existed
prior
to
any
sale
in
any
of
these
taxable
years.
the
amount
charged
and
placed
in
the
reserve,
the
rate
is
not
as
shown
because
it
is
variable.
the
3%,
you
will
note
and
that's
--
i
am
repeating
here,
refer
--
refers
to
a
percentage
of
unpaid
balances
and
not
a
percentage
of
that
particular
contract.
but,
the
contract
with
the
finance
company
preceded
and
antedated
any
receipt
of
a
note
from
a
customer,
and
we
therefore
contend
that
the
contract
itself
is
controlling.
and,
we
cite
this
simple
example.
if
a
dealer
discounted
--
received
a
$1000-note
from
a
customer,
its
face
value,
and
discounted
it
with
the
bank,
as
justice
whittaker
has
suggested,
and
received
$950,
if
that's
all
that
occur,
that
taxpayer
under
any
rule
of
accounting
would
have
net
taxable
income
of
$950
in
that
year.
he
would
have
gross
income
of
$1000,
a
business
expense
of
$50,
and
he'd
have
net
taxable
income
of
$950.
in
these
cases,
when
you
boil
them
down,
you
have
one
additional
factor
only
and
it
is,
in
my
opinion,
the
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question,
and
i'll
come
to
that
again
in
a
moment.
the
additional
factor
is
not
that
the
dealer
voluntarily
antis
up
something
to
guarantee
the
finance
company
against
loss,
but
that,
under
the
contract,
the
finance
company
gets
the
whole
$50
and
they
say,
“however,
it's
ours.
however,
if
certain
things
happen
in
the
future,
we
may
give
you
back
part
of
what
is
ours.”
now,
that,
i
think,
is
the
answer
to
the
difference
between
where
the
dealer
voluntarily
puts
something
up
to
protect
someone
and
where,
by
contract,
the
finance
company
has
it
all
and
says,
“if
certain
things
happen
in
the
future,
i'll
get
part
of
it
back.”
and,
that's
the
contingency
which
we
say,
under
the
ordinary
accrual
method
of
accounting,
entitles
us
to
defer
until
the
contingency
is
realized
and
we
have
the
right
to
that
extra
amount.
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
i
think
that
the
answer
to
the
question
is
in
just
what
mr.
justice
whittaker
just
said
that,
in
a
pledge,
the
chattel,
the
collateral
is
mine
pledged
to
the
bank
for
a
purpose.
in
the
case
that
we
have
here,
we
contend,
in
the
glover
case,
the
reserve
is
the
finance
company's
until
certain
things
happen,
and
then,
they
pay
us.
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
and
that
that
is
our
contention
and
not
that
some
portion
of
the
original
note
from
the
customer
has
been
omitted
from
income,
as
counsel
for
the
government
would
speak
to,
as
we
say,
twist
the
issue.
i
think
that
that
is
the
issue
and,
in
line
with
that,
the
contingency
--
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
contingency
which
prevents
us
from
having
present
control
of
that
retained
reserve
is,
i
think,
covered
by
the
government's
own
regulations
on
that
point
which
appear
in
government's
brief,
in
the
appendix,
page
65.
it
is
treasure
regulation
111
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
which
first
states
on
page
64
that
the
time
as
of
which
any
item
of
gross
income
or
any
deduction
is
to
be
accounted
for
must
be
determined
in
the
light
of
the
fundamental
rule
that
the
computation
shall
be
made
in
such
a
manner
as
clearly
reflects
the
taxpayer's
income.
and
then,
on
page
65,
down
approximately
15
lines,
a
taxpayer
is
deemed
to
have
received
items
of
gross
income
which
have
been
credited
to
or
set
apart
for
him
without
restriction.
now,
we
contend
that
the
government's
own
regulation
states
that
if
there
are
restrictions
on
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
receive
an
amount
set
apart
for
him,
then
it
is
not
presently
accruable.
the
contract
in
the
glover
case,
if
you
will
note
again
paragraph
4
on
page
24
of
the
glover
brief,
in
the
last
part
of
that
paragraph,
the
question
should
be
asked.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
first
year,
let's
take
the
first
year
when
the
$3885
was
omitted
by
the
taxpayer
as
not
being
then
subject
to
his
control.
it
represented
3%
of
outstanding
notes.
in
any
court
of
law,
could
glover
have
then
gone
in
and
receive
either
a
judgment
for
a
declaratory,
or
otherwise,
for
that
amount
at
that
time?
government
has
argued
that
this
should
be
done
on
an
annual
basis.
we
agree.
at
the
end
this
year,
under
this
contract
arrangement,
glover
could
not
claim
any
part
of
the
amount
below
3%.
that's
all
he
has
omitted
from
his
income
and
excluded.
he
has
deferred
it
because
the
contract
says,
“three
times
in
each
year,
if
you
are
not
indebted
to
us,
we
will
give
you
the
amount
above
3%.”
it's
silent
about
his
right
to
the
amount
below
and,
as
pointed
out
by
previous
counsel,
only
if
he
goes
out
of
business
sometime
in
the
future
can
he
ultimately,
in
the
absence
of
losses,
collect
it.
so,
we
say,
not
as
government
counsel
has
said,
only
two
things
can
happen
either
he
will
get
it
in
cash
or
it
would
be
applied
against
his
obligation.
we
say
that
completely
jumps
over
the
primary
contingency
that
he
may
never
get
it
at
all
and
he
has
no
present
right
to
it
under
the
specific
language
of
the
contract
between
the
parties.
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
statutory
notice,
the
petition,
and
the
court's
own
questions,
i
believe,
and
our
response
have
indicated
the
only
thing
in
issue
is
a
portion
of
the
reserve.
does
the
customer
have
any
control
over
that
reserve?
none
whatever.
it's
solely
within
the
control
of
the
finance
company
and,
ultimately,
the
dealer
under
certain
contingencies.
that's
the
only
issue
in
the
glover
case.
that's
all
that
was
raised
by
the
government
initially.
nothing
else
is
before
this
court
is
our
contingent
and
that,
under
that
contract,
that
reserve
account
is
in
the
control
inexorably
of
the
finance
company
until
these
contingencies
occur,
and
it
did
not
occur
in
the
taxable
year.
we
only
excluded
the
amount
that
was
subject
--
not
subject
to
our
withdrawal
or
use
because
it
cannot
even
be
applied
to
our
obligation
unless
we
got
a
right
to
it.
that's
--
that's
primary
and
elementary.
if
we
had
no
right
to
it,
they
would
sue
us
for
it.
they
wouldn't
apply
it
against
the
reserve.
the
commissioner's
argument,
if
the
court
please,
really
goes
to
the
amount
of
this
reserve
account
and
not
to
the
right.
they
don't
rely,
really,
on
spring
city
foundry
case
which
they
cite,
but
they
argue
about
the
amount
as
ultimately
going
to
be
realized.
but,
that's
not
the
question
of
immediate
taxability
under
the
accruable
system
of
accounting
--
accrual
system.
the
question
is
the
right
to
it,
not
whether
the
amount
is
fixed,
but
the
right
to
it.
and,
we
contend,
of
course,
that
even
the
amount
is
indeterminate
in
the
calendar
year,
but
the
right
to
receive
it
does
not
exist
in
the
calendar
year.
the
motors
securities
case,
cited
in
the
brief,
brings
out
the
point
that
mr.
mcinnis
mentioned
that
the
finance
company
doesn't
take
into
--
take
into
income
the
finance
charge
from
the
customer
until
they
receive
it,
and
that
certainly
is
an
inconsistency.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
the
legal
principle
upon
which
we
rely.
first,
we
rely
on
the
--
on
the
fact
that
the
issue
refers
only
to
the
finance
account,
the
reserve,
and
not
to
something
with
the
--
with
the
original
customer,
and
the
finance
company
has
control
of
that
account.
and,
the
legal
principle
that
the
taxpayer
had
no
right
to
that
$3885
in
similar
amounts
in
the
other
years
determines
this
case.
furthermore,
we
contend
that
the
sales
on
credit
and
the
financing
contract
should
be
viewed
as
a
whole
because,
before
that
credit
is
given,
it
must
be
approved.
on
page
23
of
the
brief,
the
first
sentence,
the
second
line,
“you
propose
to
buy
from
us
on
a
basis
stated
in
this
agreement
paper
acceptable
to
you”
which
indicates
that
c.i.t.
must
approve
each
transaction
before
the
customer
signs
the
note.
so,
it
is
an
integral
three-party
transaction.
and,
in
fact,
it
was
most
strange
to
hear,
and
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
dealer
does
not
have
a
legal
right
to
collect
that
note
when
it's
signed.
i
don't
think
that
is
controlling.
i
would
concede
that
he
does.
but,
the
transaction
should
be
viewed
as
a
whole
because,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
one
three-party
transaction
and,
as
i
was
saying,
it
is
strange
that
the
government
would
argue
that
this
should
be
itemize
into
separate
transaction
in
the
view
of
their
long-established
and
contented
position
in
the
court
holding
case
and
others
that
we
should
not
take
a
business
transaction
and
split
it
up
into
a
group
of
separate
parts
and
treat
them
as
independent.
in
fact,
it
reminds
me
of
what
isaac
once
said,
“the
voice
is
jacob's
voice,
but
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
esau.”
i
think
it
would
not
be
uncommon
that
the
government
would
be
back
here
on
the
other
side
of
this
question
of
itemizing
this
transaction
and
treating
it
as
separable
independent
steps.
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
the
contract
i've
been
referring
to,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
that's
correct.
but,
in
the
glover
case
--
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
--
the
basic
contract
--
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
--
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
--
his
contract
is
a
course
of
dealing
and
not
a
written
agreement,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.miller,
jr.
i
understand
that,
in
the
hansen
case,
the
contract
exists
under
a
course
of
dealing,
not
a
written
instrument,
the
basic
contract.
in
our
case,
the
basic
contract
between
the
finance
company
and
the
dealer
is
in
evidence
because
we
consider
that's
the
only
thing
in
issue,
not
the
contract
with
the
customer
because
that's
not
what
the
government
raised
when
they
filed
the
statutory
notes.
and,
finally,
on
the
legal
principles,
we
contend
that
section
41,
which
is
cited
by
the
government
in
the
appendix
at
page
60,
the
general
statute
applies
here
and
that
the
taxpayer's
method
is
correct
unless
it
fails
to
collect
correctly
state
income.
and,
in
that
connection,
i
want
to
refer
once
more
to
this
argument
that,
since
the
amount
might
sometime
in
the
future
be
applied
to
an
obligation,
it
must
now
be
approved.
that
argument
is,
it
seems
to
me,
fallacious,
in
that,
it
would
cause
a
distortion
of
income.
first,
in
the
year
in
which
you
--
you
were
required
to
take
the
income
into
account
before
you
have
the
right
to
get
it.
it
distorts
income,
over
states
it.
and
then,
in
the
later
year,
when
your
right
to
the
income
actually
accrues
and
you
apply
it
against
an
obligation,
then
you
will
--
because
you've
already
been
required
to
take
the
income
into
account,
you
will
take
into
account
a
deduction
and
understate
your
income.
the
argument
of
the
government
would
cause
a
distortion
at
two
points,
the
first
time
and
then
at
the
time
that
the
obligation
is
actually
satisfied
from
a
reserve
to
which
you
then
had
the
right.
and,
we
submit
that
this
case
--
in
these
cases,
the
taxpayer's
method
of
accounting
has
correctly
reflected
income.
