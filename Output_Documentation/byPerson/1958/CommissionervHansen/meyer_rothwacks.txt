mr.
meyer
rothwacks
may
it
please
this
court.
numbers
380,
381
and
512,
the
baird
case,
are
all
income
tax
cases.
they
involve
the
so-called
dealers
reserve
issue.
they
are
three
cases
in
a
long
line
of
litigation
extending,
since
1940,
on
this
important
issue.
and
they
have
all
been
litigated
against
a
background
of
a
consistent
administrative
practice
since
1931,
which
supports
the
position
which
the
commissioner
takes
before
this
court.
since
1931,
of
course,
there
had
been
two
enactments
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
enact
any
provisions
in
support
of
the
position
which
the
taxpayer
dealers
advocate
before
this
court.
now
these
cases,
all
of
them,
involved
dealers
who
are
on
an
accrual
basis
of
accounting.
they
sell
goods
on
credit.
they
receive,
from
their
customers,
contracts
and
other
retail
paper
which
embodies
the
customer's
obligation,
an
obligation
to
pay
a
full-time
deferred
balance.
now,
this
contract
is
entered
into
between
the
dealer
and
the
purchaser.
the
finance
company
is
not
a
part
or
party
to
that
contract.
the
dealer
may
retain
the
contract,
he
may
retain
the
notes,
or
he
may
sell
them.
and
in
all
of
these
cases,
he
did
indeed
sell
them
to
one
or
more
finance
companies.
having
sold
the
obligations
of
his
purchasers
to
finance
companies,
the
dealer
was
then
paid
a
certain
amount
of
approximately
the
face
value
of
the
paper
in
cash
by
the
finance
company,
and
the
remaining
portion
was
paid
in
the
form
of
a
credit
that
was
entered
on
the
finance
companies'
books
as
a
liability
of
the
finance
company.
and
eventually,
as
we
shall
make
more
clear
in
the
development
of
our
argument,
eventually,
the
amounts
of
those
credits
were
paid
to
the
dealers
either
in
cash
or
in
the
discharge
of
the
dealer's
obligations
to
the
finance
companies.
now,
the
question
that
is
raised
here
in
all
of
these
cases
is
an
important
one.
it's
important,
not
only
from
the
purpose
from
the
viewpoint
of
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting,
it's
also
important
from
a
practical
point
of
view.
now,
the
taxpayers'
representatives
will,
no
doubt,
urge
upon
this
court
why
is
the
government
seeking
to
report
--
to
have
the
dealers
report
the
amounts
that
were
credited
in
the
dealer's
reserve
accounts
when
they
were
credited,
when,
eventually,
they
will
report
them
when
they
get
paid
or
when
their
obligations
to
the
finance
company
are
discharged?
as
i
said
before,
the
question
is
not
only
of
great
academic
importance
in
connection
with
the
integrity
of
the
--
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
accrual
principle,
but
if
this
court
were
to
accept
the
position
advocated
by
the
taxpayers,
the
effect
of
it
would
be,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
thousands
of
automobile
and
trailer
dealers
throughout
the
country,
to
take
them
off
the
pay
as
you
go
basis
and
unto
a,
more
or
less,
rollback
basis,
but
it
would
also
give
the
green
light
to
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
other
credit
businesses
all
over
the
country
to
do
precisely
the
same
thing.
now,
there
are
two
simple
controlling
principles
in
these
cases.
the
first
is
--
and
this
court
has
stated
it
many
times,
the
first
is
that,
while
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
reports
income
on
an
actual
or
constructive
receipt
of
the
cash,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting.
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
must
report
his
income
and
pay
the
tax
on
it
upon
the
fixation
of
his
right
to
receive
the
income
and
not
upon
actual
or
constructive
receipt
of
income.
and
the
fact
that
the
payment
may
be
deferred,
the
fact
that
the
agreement
between
the
parties
may
contemplate
that,
while
the
amount
is
fixed,
while
the
obligation
is
presently
fixed,
payment
may
be
made
in
the
future
is
irrelevant
and
immaterial
to
the
accrual
basis
of
accounting.
and
in
--
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it
--
it
arises,
i
believe,
under
the
regulations
that
were
promulgated
pursuant
to
sections
41,
42
and
possibly
43
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
they
--
they
are
not.
they
are
not.
but
they
have
been
so
clearly
and
so
often
enunciated
by
this
court
and
by
other
courts
that
we
didn't
feel
it
necessary
to
print
that.
we'll
be
very
glad
to
do
it.
this
court
said,
for
example,
in
the
spring
city
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
will
remember
that
the
taxpayer
was
on
the
accrual
basis.he
sold
goods
on
an
open
account
in
1920.
his
customer
went
into
bankruptcy
in
that
year.
in
1923
and
1924,
he
received
dividends
from
the
receiver
in
bankruptcy.
the
taxpayer
reported
his
income,
in
--
in
1923
and
1924,
the
amounts
which
he
received
from
the
receiver.
this
court
said
“no.”
this
court
said
he
was
required
to
report
the
amounts
as
income
in
1920
because
keeping
accounts
and
making
returns
on
the
accrual
basis,
this
court
said,
as
distinguished
from
the
cash
basis,
important
that
it
is
the
right
to
receive
and
not
the
actual
receipt
that
determines
the
inclusion
of
the
amount
in
gross
income,
and
when
the
right
becomes
fixed,
then
the
right
accrues.
and
the
second
controlling
principle
in
these
cases,
related
somewhat
to
the
accrual
accounting
principle,
is
that
every
taxpayer
under
our
revenue
system,
regardless
of
the
accounting
method
that
he
uses,
is
required
to
compute
his
income
and
to
report
his
income
on
the
basis
of
an
annual,
as
distinguished
from
a
transactional,
basis.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
an
income
producing
transaction
such
as
the
sale
of
an
automobile
or
trailer
on
credit,
as
in
these
cases,
extends
over
a
period
of
more
than
one
year,
as
they
did
in
these
cases.
it
does
not
affect
the
requirement
but
under
our
tax
system,
the
computation
of
the
income
for
tax
purposes
must
show
the
net
result
of
all
of
the
taxpayer's
transactions
in
a
given
year
rather
than
the
net
result
of
any
particular
transaction
which
may
extend
beyond
that
period.
now,
the
facts
in
each
of
the
cases
in
380,
381
and
512
are
of
course
somewhat
different.
but
while
there
are
factual
differences,
we
maintain
that
in
their
broad
significant
aspects,
they
do
present
a
workable
common
picture
which
we
may
use
to
determine
the
application
of
the
controlling
principles
which
i
have
just
enunciated.
now,
generally
speaking,
in
these
cases,
the
taxpayers
were
dealers
who
sold
automobiles
or
trailers
on
credit.
they
entered
into
negotiations
with
their
customers.
they
arrived
at
a
time
before
balance
with
their
customers.
they
took
the
contract
or
the
note
of
the
customer
which
reflected
the
full-time
balance
less
the
amount
that
was
paid
in
cash
or
the
trade-in
value
of
the
car
that
was
offered.
and
that
was
the
obligation
of
the
customer,
the
purchaser,
to
pay
to
the
dealer.
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
at
all,
in
any
of
the
records
in
these
cases,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
finance
company
may
have
supplied
forms
for
the
convenience
of
the
taxpayers
that
the
finance
company
participated
in
any
way
in
the
negotiations
between
the
dealer,
on
the
one
hand
and
his
customer,
on
the
other,
nor
was
the
dealer
under
any
obligation
at
all
to
sell
his
contract
or
notes
either
to
the
finance
company
to
which
he
actually
did
sell
or
to
any
other
finance
company.
now,
the
fact
is,
of
course,
that
he
did
sell
the
contract.
he
did
sell
the
notes
under
agreements
which
were
either
oral
or
written.
in
some
instances,
the
notes
were
transferred
with
recourse,
in
some
instances,
without.
the
contracts
vary
--
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
yes?
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
well,
the
--
the
notes,
in
some
instances,
were
transferred
without
--
without
recourse
but
the
contracts,
the
contracts
would
provide
guarantees
running
from
the
--
after
the
sale
of
the
note
to
the
--
to
the
finance
company.
the
contracts
between
the
--
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company
would
provide
guarantee,
certain
guarantees
running
from
the
dealer
to
the
finance
companies.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
well,
they
were
--
they
were
separate
agreements.
lf
your
honor
is
referring
to
--
now
to
the
transaction
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company,
yes,
they
were
separate
agreements,
separate
transactions,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
baird
case,
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
schaeffer
case
and
last
week,
in
the
wiley
case
have
so
held.
now,
on
the
sale
of
the
notes
--
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
that
the
transactions
were
separable
transactions.
that
the
one
transaction
was
that
between
the
dealer
and
his
customer
in
which
the
customer
gave
the
dealer
the
contract
and
the
note
which
embodied
the
full-time
deferred
balance.
then,
there
was
a
separate
transaction
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company
in
which
in
a
contract
which
was
either
written
or
oral,
the
dealer
sold
the
note
or
sold
the
contract
to
the
finance
company
and
there
were
certain
obligations
under
the
contract
running
from
the
finance
company
to
the
dealer
and
from
the
dealer
to
the
finance
company.
we'll
come
to
those
later.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
yes,
seventh
and
--
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
that's
right.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
we
don't
think
so.
we
don't
think
that
there
are
any
important
differences
that
--
on
our
rationale
and
the
rationale
of
the
wiley
case
last
week
in
the
sixth
circuit,
there
are
no
important
differences
among
these
cases.
i
may,
at
this
point,
interpolate
by
saying
that
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
these
cases,
filed
by
counsel
in
the
wiley
case,
does
suggest
that
there
may
be
an
important
difference
in
a
situation
where
the
dealer
sells
the
obligation
of
his
customer
to
the
finance
company
and
the
finance
company
credits
what
is
referred
to
as
a
holdback
which,
i
take
it,
is
part
of
the
--
what
would
normally
be
the
purchase
price,
if
there
were
no
service
charge
or
finance
charge
added
on
to
the
original
note
between
the
dealer
and
his
customer.
the
position
of
counsel
in
the
wiley
case
was
that
where
--
where
the
credit,
which
was
entered
by
the
finance
company
on
its
books
in
favor
of
the
dealer,
reflected
something
other
than
this
so-called
holdback,
namely,
a
finance
charge,
then
another
principle
obtained.
and
in
the
wiley
case,
which
was
handed
down
on
april
24
and
which
was
argued
just
10
days
ago,
i
believe,
or
two
weeks
ago,
the
wiley
case,
in
effect,
held
that
the
factual
differences
that
were
pointed
out
by
counsel
are
not
sufficient
to
distinguish
this
case
in
principle
from
the
ruling
in
the
schaeffer
case
which
it
had
previously
decided.
now,
what
i
have
given
so
far
is,
admittedly,
a
generalized
picture
of
what
transpired
in
these
cases.
and
while
this
court
will,
of
course,
look
to
the
records,
it
may
be
helpful
on
this
opening
presentation
to
at
least
give
the
highlights
of
the
pertinent
facts
with
respect
to
the
records
in
each
of
these
cases.
now,
in
hansen,
number
380,
we
find
practically
everything
that
we're
looking
for
at
record
39,
joint
exhibit
5e,
and
that's
--
contract,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
a
conditional
sales
contract
between
a
dealer
and
his
customer.
and
the
dealer
sells
and
the
customer
buys
a
car
for
a
total
time
price
which,
among
other
things,
includes
a
finance
charge
and
which
results
in
an
obligation
called
the
“time
deferred
balance”
which
is
the
amount
reflected
as
the
customer's
obligation
to
the
dealer
in
the
conditional
sale
contract.
but
then,
at
the
--
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
at
record
39,
number
380.
now,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
on
this
form
which
was
provided
by
gmac,
the
dealer
then
sells
and
--
and
as
i
said
before,
he
was
not
obliged
to
sell.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
of
the
taxpayer
makes
this
seemingly
clear.
he
was
asked,
record
33,
“you
are
free
either
to
hold
these
conditional
sales
contracts
or
sign
them,
depending
upon
what
you
wanted
to
do.”
the
answer
was
“what
do
you
mean
hold
them?”
question,
“hold
them
personally,
assuming
you
had
sufficient
cash.
i'm
not
saying
that
you
did.”
the
answer
was
“yes,
i
could
have
held
them
if
i
--
if
i
had
my
own
contracts
made
up.”
he
was
asked
whether
he
could
have
signed
them
to
any
other
finance
company
and
the
answer
to
that
was
yes.
so,
nothing
of
any
consequence
turns
in
taxpayer's
favor
on
the
mere
fact
that
the
conditional
sale
contract
from
the
dealer
to
the
finance
company
happens
to
be
on
the
same
sheet
of
paper
as
the
completely
separate
contract
between
the
dealer
and
the
customer.
now,
in
the
contract
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company,
the
dealer
sells
to
gmac
its
right,
title
and
interest
to
the
--
within
contract
and
the
dealer,
in
turn,
guarantees
full
payment
of
the
amount
remaining
unpaid
hereon
and
covenants
that
if
default
be
made
in
the
payment
of
any
installment,
then
to
pay
the
full
amount
unpaid
to
gmac.
the
purpose
of
this
reserve,
as
the
tax
court
found
and
as
indeed,
mr.
hansen
himself
testified,
was
to
protect
gmac
against
any
loss
that
might
arise
from
the
repossession
of
any
automobile
in
case
of
default
in
payment.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
i
think
the
agreement
simply
spells
out
what
the
parties
sold
to
each
other
and
the
purpose
of
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
contract,
it
seems
--
would
seem
to
us,
could
be
ascertained
from
the
testimony
of
the
party
entering
into
the
contract.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
well,
that's
--
that's
another
way
of
stating,
i
think,
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
the
important
point
from
the
commissioner's
point
of
view
is,
as
we
will
develop
the
argument
later
on,
that
these
are
separate
transactions,
that
they
are
not
telescoped
into
a
single
transaction.
and
this
is
the
point
of
view
that
was
adopted
in
the
baird,
schaeffer
and
wiley
cases.
now,
in
the
glover
case,
we
have
a
very
short
record
and
practically
everything
that
is
of
use
to
us
in
this
case
is
found
in
the
stipulation
at
record
20.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
sold
new
and
used
cars
on
credit.
he
received
notes
from
his
purchasers.
the
record
doesn't
show
the
composition
of
the
notes.
however,
the
record
does
show
an
agreement
between
c.i.t.,
which
was
the
finance
company
and
the
dealer,
and
that
agreement
provided
that
the
paper
executed
by
the
dealer
--
by
the
customer
to
the
dealer
was
to
be
sold
to
the
finance
company
without
recourse
except
as
to
commercial
cars,
that
the
finance
company
would
pay
the
dealer
97%
of
the
face
value
of
the
notes
and
would
credit
--
would
set
up
credit
on
its
books
to
the
extent
of
the
remaining
3%
that
c.i.t.
would
pay
to
the
taxpayer
out
of
the
reserve
everything
in
excess
of
3%
of
the
total
outstanding
balance
on
the
notes,
three
times
in
every
12-month
period
if
the
taxpayer
was
not
then
indebted
to
it.
and
that
in
the
event
c.i.t.
stopped
buying
paper
from
glover,
then
c.i.t.
could
hold
and
apply
the
credits
until
all
the
paper
was
liquidated.
the
dealer's
obligations
under
this
contract
with
c.i.t.
was
to
purchase
--
to
repurchase
the
--
the
repossessed
cars
and
if
it
failed
to
do
so,
to
make
good
to
c.i.t.
for
any
loss
that
it
was
--
was
incurred
by
c.i.t.
and
to
pay
a
proportionate
amount
of
the
amount
that
was
credited
to
the
reserve
in
the
event
any
purchaser
prepaid
on
his
obligation.
c.i.t.
would
refund
the
part
of
the
service
charge.
the
obligation
of
the
dealer
was
to
pay
a
proportionate
part
of
that
refund
out
of
the
amounts
in
the
credits.
in
the
baird
case,
we
have
a
dealer
who,
in
the
main,
sold
trailers.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
this
is
the
seventh
circuit
case,
also,
other
commodities.
he
sold
on
--
this
was
a
partnership
which
sold
on
conditional
sales
contracts
and
received
notes
from
its
customers.
it
sold
its
notes
to
three
finance
companies.
one
of
them
was
a
bank.
and
in
every
instance,
the
paper
was
either
endorsed
with
recourse
or
the
partnership
independently
guaranteed
payment
to
the
finance
companies.
the
finance
companies
paid
over
95%
to
97%
of
the
amount
of
the
customer's
obligation
and
credited
the
remainder
to
the
dealer's
reserve
account
in
favor
of
the
partnership.
now,
it's
important
to
noted
that
here,
as
in
the
other
cases,
the
finance
companies
carried
the
accounts
as
liabilities
and
that
the
annual
balances
in
the
reserves
--
in
the
credit
in
reserves
which
they
carried
were
not
at
all
reflected
in
their
income.
it
was
provided,
as
between
the
partnership
and
the
finance
companies
that,
in
any
event,
the
credits
would
be
paid
to
the
partnership
after
all
of
the
customer's
obligations
had
been
fulfilled,
in
other
words,
after
all
the
notes
have
been
paid.
there
were
also
other
provisions
for
accelerated
payment.
for
example,
in
the
first
--
one
of
two
contracts
with
one
of
the
finance
companies,
midland
it
was
provided
that
when
the
reserve
fund
exceeded
10%
of
the
balance
of
the
total
outstanding
obligations
of
customers,
the
excess
would
be
paid
over
by
the
finance
company
to
the
dealer
automatically.
furthermore,
it
was
agreed
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
companies
that
the
credits
entered
on
the
finance
companies'
books
in
favor
of
the
dealer
could
be
charged
with
any
unpaid
balance
owing
by
the
customer,
could
be
charged
with
repossession
losses
suffered
by
the
finance
companies,
could
be
charged
with
any
default
by
the
partnership
on
its
independent
guarantees
to
the
finance
company
and
also,
could
be
charged
with
a
matured
financial
obligation
of
any
nature,
running
from
the
partnership
to
the
finance
companies
of
any
nature
not
necessarily
related
to
the
sale
of
the
automobile
or
trailer
by
the
dealer
to
his
customer.
now,
we
think
that
this
brief
review
of
what
we
consider
to
be
the
salient
facts
in
this
case
demonstrates
that,
basically,
there
was
a
common
mode
of
dealing
in
these
cases.
first,
a
sale
of
a
commodity
between
dealer
and
customer,
the
signing
of
a
contract,
the
issuance
of
paper.
secondly,
the
sale
of
a
contract
or
paper
to
a
finance
company
not
under
any
legal
obligation
to
do
so
whatsoever.
thirdly,
the
finance
company
would
pay
part
of
the
value
of
the
contract
or
note
that
it
bought
and
would
set
up
the
balance
as
a
credit
to
the
dealer.
and
the
credit
--
the
balance
was
to
be
paid
in
due
course
pursuant
to
arrangements
that
were
made
between
the
dealers
and
the
finance
companies.
now,
on
this
common
analysis
of
the
facts,
the
courts
have
said
that
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
the
transactions,
two
ways
of
looking
at
what
happened
in
these
cases.
in
the
baird
case,
which
is
the
seventh
circuit
case,
and
in
schaeffer
and
by
necessary
implication,
the
wiley
opinion
which
was
handed
down
on
april
24,
the
courts
have
said
that
we're
dealing
here
with
two
separate
and
distinct
transactions,
first,
the
sale
of
the
commodity
to
the
purchaser
at
a
time-deferred
balance,
second,
the
sale
of
a
paper
to
the
finance
company.
on
the
other
hand,
the
hansen
case
spells
out
another
theory.
this
was
announced,
i
think,
in
the
texas
trailercoach,
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
single
three-party
transaction.
now,
the
two
transaction
hypothesis
was
used
by
the
courts
to
support
taxability
of
the
amounts
that
were
credited
to
the
reserves
when
the
credits
were
made.
the
one
transaction,
three-party
hypothesis
has
been
used
by
the
courts
to
support
the
contrary
conclusion.
now,
while
we
think
that
the
better
reason
theory
is
the
reasoning
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits,
we,
nevertheless,
believe,
and
we'll
attempt
to
demonstrate,
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
theory
is
used.
the
tax
incidence
remains
the
same.
now,
what
is
there
to
support
the
two
transaction
theory
in
these
cases?
first,
it
was
the
dealer,
not
the
finance
company
that
actually
sold
a
car
or
trailer.
the
purchaser's
contract
was
with
the
dealer,
not
with
the
finance
company.
the
note
executed
for
the
contract
obligation
was
payable
to
the
dealer,
not
to
the
finance
company.
the
dealer
was
under
no
legal
obligation
whatsoever
to
sell
the
contract
or
any
note.
he
could
have
financed
any
deal
himself
if
he
had
had
the
ability.
as
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
the
baird
case,
in
a
typical
case,
the
dealer
completed
the
transaction
of
the
sale
of
a
trailer
at
the
time
the
down
payment
was
made
and
the
purchaser
executed
and
delivered
to
it
notes
and
a
chattel
mortgage
or
a
conditional
sales
contract.
the
dealer,
thus,
acquired
a
complete
and
forceable
right
to
receive
the
remainder
of
the
purchase
price
at
the
times
specified
in
the
--
in
the
retail
paper.
in
the
schaeffer
case,
which
is
the
sixth
circuit
case,
the
court
was
even
more
emphatic.
it
said
that
the
first
transaction,
the
transaction
between
the
dealer
and
the
customer,
was
the
controlling
factor
in
the
case.
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
in
taking
the
purchaser's
note
and
conditional
sale
contract,
the
dealer
acquired
an
asset
in
the
nature
of
an
account
receivable
with
respect
to
which
there
was
no
contingency
whatsoever.
as
between
the
dealer
and
the
purchaser,
the
entire
amount
of
the
contract
obligation
approved
to
the
dealer.
if
such
account
receivable
became
uncollectible
in
the
future
in
whole
or
in
part,
the
question
then
was
one
of
taking
a
deduction
under
an
applicable
statute.
but
the
income
accrued
to
the
dealer
before
the
transfer
was
made
to
the
finance
company,
and
the
subsequent
transfer
did
not
change
the
legal
effect
of
the
prior
completed
transaction.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
was
your
honor
thinking
in
terms
--
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
--
of
the
prepayments?
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
well,
we
think
not
for
this
reason,
that
the
dealer
would
either
get
the
amount
in
cash
or
it
would
get
it
in
discharge
of
its
obligations
to
the
finance
company
by
virtue
of
its
own
contractual
setup
with
the
--
with
the
finance
company.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
the
endorsement
of
the
paper
for
one
thing
but
--
and
--
and
more,
the
agreements
to
--
to
guarantee
the
payment
of
the
--
of
the
full
amount
of
--
of
the
note
or
the
contract
by
the
purchaser
and
to
say
the
--
the
finance
company
harmless
in
the
event
of
a
repossession.
and
in
--
in
the
baird
case,
in
the
baird
case,
went
into
further.
in
the
baird
case,
the
contract
called
for
the
credits
to
be
applied
against
any
indebtedness
of
any
kind
of
the
--
of
the
partnership
dealer
to
the
--
to
the
finance
company,
whether
or
not
it
arose
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
a
trailer
or
--
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
yes.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
we
--
we
assumed
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
deduction.
this
is
in
the
very
nature
of
the
accrual
system
of
accounting.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
a
fixed
right
to
the
income
and
we
say,
for
example,
when
the
--
when
the
dealer
--
when
the
customer
rather,
executed
his
note
to
the
purchaser
as
the
courts
in
the
baird
and
schaeffer
cases
have
said.
the
dealer
had
then
an
enforceable
right
to
the
full
amount
of
that
--
of
that
note.
now,
any
--
any
dealer
who
sells
commodities
on
--
on
credits
and
--
and
includes
in
the
--
in
the
amount
of
the
price
to
be
paid
by
--
by
the
customer,
a
--
a
finance
charge,
accrues
the
--
accrues
the
amount.
the
--
the
accrual
isn't
--
isn't
defeated,
isn't
negated,
isn't
--
isn't
undermined
in
any
way
if,
after
he
has
dealt
with
his
customer,
he
decides
to
go
to
a
bank
and
--
and
discount
the
paper,
discount
the
note.
it's
interesting
--
it's
interesting,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
connection
with
your
question
that
in
a
case
in
which
the
government's
position
was
not
sustained,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
on
the
hansen
case,
the
--
the
hansen
opinion
says,
at
least,
it
doesn't
seriously
question
the
correctness
of
the
conclusion
that
the
full
amount,
which
is
credited
to
the
reserve
but
which
was
reflected
at
a
prior
time
in
the
contract
or
obligation,
is
income
when
the
sale
is
made
and
when
the
credits
are
made
because
this
is
practically
simultaneously.
the
hansen
opinion
said
that
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
theory
of
the
tax
court's
position.
had
the
dealer
financed
the
sales
himself
or
elected
to
sell
the
contract
as
a
separate
transaction,
the
result
reached
below
would
be
correct.
now,
if
we
look
to
the
conclusion
of
the
dealer-purchaser
transaction
as
giving
rise
to
the
taxable
event,
which
is
what
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
have
said,
it
seems
fairly
clear
that
insofar
as
the
dealer
is
concerned,
there
are
no
uncertainties
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
payment
of
the
obligation
which
would
bar
accrual
because
the
only
uncertainty,
the
only
uncertainty
is
the
one
that
is
inherent
in
every
debtor-creditor
relationship,
namely,
that
it
may
turn
out
that
the
debtor
may
not
be
able
to
pay.
but
it's,
of
course,
fundamental,
fundamental
under
our
accrual
basis
of
accounting
that
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
who
receives
payment
in
the
form
of
a
promissory
note
or
any
other
shows
of
an
action,
which
appears
to
be
collectible,
cannot
refuse
to
accrue
the
amount
of
the
obligation
simply
because
it
might
not
prove
to
be
collectible
when
due.
if
such
a
concept
were
adopted,
it
would
indeed
undermine
the
entire
theory
of
accrual
accounting
in
regard
to
commercial
transactions.
now,
returning
for
a
moment
to
the
hypothesis
espoused
by
the
hansen
opinion,
in
effect,
what
the
hansen
opinion
does
is
to
telescope,
to
telescope
everything
that
transpired
and
to
say
“we
look
not
to
the
amount
of
the
note,
not
to
the
amount
of
the
contract
as
between
dealer
and
purchaser,
but
we
look
only
to
the
credits
that
were
entered
by
the
finance
company
after
sale
of
the
obligation
or
the
note.”
and
in
effect,
the
hansen
opinion
says,
although
not
in
these
words,
that
looking
to
the
transaction
in
this
way,
we
find
that
there
are
such
grave
uncertainties
that
the
dealers
will
receive
any
payment
at
all,
that
the
credits
are
really
contingent
credits
and
not
accrued
income.
now,
let
us
ask
ourselves,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
uncertainties
as
to
the
payments
out
of
the
reserves?
in
the
first
place,
whatever
they
were,
whatever
they
were,
they
certainly
were
no
greater
than
the
uncertainty
of
payment
would
have
been
if
the
dealer
had
retained
the
purchaser's
contract
or
had
retained
the
notes
himself.
the
real
uncertainty
in
both
situations,
and
i
stressed
this,
the
real
uncertainty
in
both
situations
was
that
the
purchaser
would
fail
to
make
payment
on
the
notes.
and
as
far
as
the
dealer
is
concerned,
he
has
added
nothing
to
his
risk
by
disposing
of
the
retail
paper
instead
of
holding
it
himself.
the
same
risk
is
there,
and
it's
no
more
than
the
normal
risk
of
any
commercial
seller
who
has
sold
on
credit
rather
than
for
cash.
in
the
second
place,
the
records
in
these
cases
show
no
basis
at
all
for
concern
on
the
part
of
the
dealers
that
the
credits
would
not,
in
due
course,
be
paid
over
to
them.
if
we
look
to
the
hansen
record,
we
find
that
mr.
hansen
testified
at
record
31
that
there
were
only
some
prepayments,
that
there
were
some
loses
from
abnormal
depreciation
before
repossession,
and
that
the
bad
debts
charged
on
his
books
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
credit
sales
of
automobiles.
in
the
glover
record,
which
is
sparse
indeed,
nothing
is
shown
as
to
purchaser's
defaults
or
prepayments.
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
shown
that
the
taxpayer
had
total
bad
debt
expenses
of
only
some
$13,000
out
of
more
than
$3
million
of
gross
retail
sales.
in
the
baird
case,
at
record
19,
is
the
conclusion
that
most
of
the
trailer
purchasers
were
paying
their
notes
when
due.
furthermore,
there's
nothing
in
these
cases,
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
records
in
any
of
these
cases
to
show
that
the
finance
companies
would
not
be
in
any
position
to
pay
over
the
credits
at
the
appropriate
times.
in
the
hansen
and
glover
cases,
there
isn't
a
slightest
indication
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
possibility
that
gmac
and
c.i.t.
could
not
perform
when
it
came
time
to
perform
and
in
the
baird
case,
indeed,
it
was
stipulated
that
during
the
years
here
involved,
the
finance
companies
were
in
such
good
financial
condition
that
they
were
able
to
pay
any
accounts
which
might
have
been
due
and
payable
to
the
partnership
out
of
the
dealer
reserve.
and
finally,
even
if
the
dealers
were
not
paid
in
cash
out
of
the
reserves,
we
submit
that
they
would
have
had
their
obligations
to
the
finance
companies
discharged
by
offsets
against
the
credits
and
so,
would
have
realized
income
in
that
fashion.
as
the
baird
opinion
says,
ultimately,
only
two
things
could
happen
to
the
funds
in
the
dealer's
reserve
accounts.
either
the
amounts
would
be
paid
in
cash
or
they
would
be
used
to
satisfy
the
dealer's
other
obligations
to
the
finance
companies.
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
in
the
schaeffer
case,
looking
to
the
hypothesis
upon
which
the
hansen
case
is
predicated,
there
was
nothing
contingent
about
the
dealer's
legal
right
to
the
amounts
credited
in
the
reserve
account.the
only
contingency
that
existed
was
how
much
of
the
--
the
amounts
would
be
paid
in
cash
and
how
much
would
not
be
paid
in
cash
but
would
be
applied
by
the
finance
company
to
the
payment
of
the
dealer's
legal
obligations
to
it
under
the
contracts
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
companies.
now,
we
think
that
when
properly
analyzed,
the
taxpayer's
real
grievance
in
these
cases
is
that
a
tax
must
be
paid
without
the
funds
upon
which
the
tax
is
levied
being
available
for
the
payment
of
the
tax.
but
as
the
hansen
opinion
itself
pointed
out
in
this
case,
this
may
often
be
the
result,
it
said,
of
the
accrual
accounting
just
as
it
may
be
the
result
of
the
operation
of
the
doctrine
of
realization
and
of
the
doctrine
of
constructive
receipt.
and
secondly,
taxpayer's
real
grievance
may
be
in
these
cases
that
they
are
entitled
to
some
relief
because,
as
stated
in
the
baird
case,
they
find
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
finance
companies.
we
think
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
has
given
the
correct
answer
to
this
plea.
congress
has
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
income
taxes.
if
the
application
of
the
income
tax
law
to
persons
situated,
as
taxpayers
say
they
were,
require
a
special
consideration,
then
it's
for
congress
to
say
so,
not
the
courts.
our
duty
is
to
ascertain
what
the
law
is
and
apply
it
to
this
case.
and
to
that
conclusion,
the
commissioner
says
“amen.”
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
may
it
please
this
court.
i
should
like
to
say,
at
the
outset,
that
i
am
grateful
to
counsel
for
calling
my
attention
to
an
apparent
misstatement
of
mine
yesterday.
the
government,
of
course,
does
not
contend
that
all
of
the
so-called
finance
charges
eventually
come
into
the
pocket
of
the
dealer.
it's
obvious
that
only
a
portion
of
the
finance
charge
does.
now,
first
i'd
like
to
say
that,
in
effect
--
in
effect,
and
not
without
some
reasonable
basis
from
their
point
of
view,
in
effect,
counsel
on
the
other
side
are
asking
us
to
accept,
for
tax
purposes,
a
view
of
these
situations
which
their
accountants
would
urge
upon
them.
now,
while
the
conclusions
drawn
by
my
brothers
may
be
reasonable
from
an
accounting
point
of
view,
they're
not
necessarily
conclusive
from
a
tax
point
of
view.
this
court,
of
course,
had
said
so
at
least
on
two
occasions.
in
weiss
versus
wiener,
this
court
said
that
income
tax
laws
do
not
profess
to
embody
perfect
economic
theory.
they
ignore
some
things
that
either
a
theorist
or
a
businessman
would
take
into
account
in
determining
the
pecuniary
condition
of
the
taxpayer.
and,
in
the
baisely
case,
this
court
says
that
the
form
of
the
transaction,
as
reflected
by
correct,
and
i
emphasize,
as
reflected
by
correct
corporate
accounting,
merely
opens
questions
as
to
the
proper
application
of
a
tax
statute,
it
doesn't
close
them.
now,
what,
in
substance,
is
involved
in
these
cases?
as
was
mentioned
yesterday,
long
prior
to
the
first
litigated
case
on
this
question,
the
shoemaker-nash
case
in
1940,
the
commissioner
had
a
simple,
clear,
understandable,
administrative
position
and
practice
with
respect
to
this
issue.
the
first,
gcm
was
in
1931.
along
came
a
ruling
in
1957
which
reaffirmed
it
but
which
was,
in
a
sense,
clearer
than
the
prior
gcm
because
it
set
forth,
from
the
industry
point
of
view,
from
a
nationwide
point
of
view,
from
a
trade
practice
point
of
view,
what
is
involved
in
these
cases?
and,
i'd
like
to
read
two
or
three
sentences
of
that
ruling
because
this
is
what
the
commissioner
determined
was
the
essence
of
the
transactions
in
the
business
situation
which
with
--
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
this
is
the
1957.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
this
is
the
1957.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
in
explaining
what
happens
in
these
transactions,
the
ruling
said,
“when
a
car
is
purchased
on
credit
from
a
dealer,
the
purchaser
makes
a
down
payment
either
in
the
form
of
cash
or
by
turning
in
another
car
in
an
agreed
value,
the
balance
being
satisfied
by
the
purchaser's
promissory
note
and
a
supporting
conditional
sales
contract.”
and,
now
comes
the
important
sentence,
and
i
think
this
must
be
true
with
respect
to
all
of
the
transactions
involved
here,
as
they
are
with
respect
to
the
transactions
involved
in
the
thousands
of
situations
of
this
kind
that
are
entered
into
annually
over
the
country.
“the
face
amount
of
the
note
reflects
two
elements,
not
one,
two
elements.
the
balance
of
what
would
be
the
purchase
price
of
the
car
and,
the
second,
a
finance
charge.”
now,
in
those
situations
in
which
the
dealer
signed
a
contract
with
the
purchaser
and
executed
a
note,
the
note
was
sold
to
the
finance
company.
in
the
situation,
as
in
the
hansen
case,
where
we're
not
dealing
with
notes
but
a
conditional
sale
contract,
we
have,
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed
out,
we
have
a
contract
and
the
contract
--
the
parties
in
the
contract
are
the
dealer
and
the
purchaser.
now,
it's,
of
course,
true
that
the
collateral
arrangement
between
the
parties
may
call
for
the
payment
of
the
amounts
over
the
cash
purchase
price.
the
deferred
amounts
may
call
for
payment
to
the
--
at
the
locale
and
to
the
finance
company.
but,
insofar
as
the
contract
between
the
parties
are
concerned,
there
are
only
two
parties
the
dealer
and
the
purchaser.
and,
the
contract
in
the
hansen
case
obligates
the
purchaser
to
pay
what
is
called
in
the
contract
“at
designation
eight,”
a
time-deferred
balance,
and
then
we
have
a
completely
separate
document.
true,
it's
on
the
same
sheet
of
paper,
but
it
involves
two
other,
that
is,
it
involves
two
parties,
and
they're
not
the
same
parties
as
were
involved
in
the
conditional
sales
contract,
involved
a
dealer
and
the
finance
company.
now,
why
has
this
practice
grown
up?
the
government
has
taken
care
to
set
forth,
rather
voluminously,
in
some
footnotes
to
its
brief
found
at
page
44,
articles
that
are
written,
three,
i
think
they
are,
that
were
written
in
the
indiana
law
journal
which
indicate
--
make
it
very
clear
that
the
arrangement
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company
was
this.
you
do
your
business
with
your
purchaser.
you
get
your
price
set
with
him.
you
had
a
finance
charge
and,
if
you
will
then
sell
us
your
purchaser's
obligation,
we'll
rake
you
in,
so
to
speak,
on
part
of
the
finance
charge
which,
under
other
conditions
and
except
for
our
understanding,
would
go
entirely
to
us.
so
that,
as
even
the
hansen
opinion
conceded,
the
finance
charge
was
worked
into,
and
this
is
the
language
of
the
hansen
opinion,
the
finance
charge
was
worked
into
the
sales
price.
and,
part
of
that
sales
price
was
the
amount
that
was
reflected
in
the
dealer's
reserve
account
set
up
in
favor
of
the
dealer.
now,
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
uncertainty,
if
there
was
any,
that
the
dealer
would
not
receive
the
full
amount
in
those
credits
could
arise
only
because
there
would
be
either
a
default
on
the
part
of
the
purchaser,
which
was
an
uncertainty
no
greater
than
the
uncertainty
in
any
commercial
transaction
of
any
kind,
where
it
is
always
possible
that
the
debtor
may
not
be
able
to
perform.
and,
the
second
uncertainty
was
that
in
those
very
fortunate
circumstances
in
which
the
purchaser
found
himself
able
to
prepay,
that
if
there
was
a
reduction
in
the
finance
charge,
which
would
then
be
owing
by
the
purchaser
to
the
finance
company,
there
would
be
a
corresponding
offset
in
the
credit.
now,
that
doesn't
affect
the
situation,
as
far
as
the
accrual
principle
of
accounting
is
concerned.
in
the
first
place,
one
would
have
to
examine
these
records
with
a
microscope
to
find
any
real
indication
that
the
incidence
of
prepayment
was
so
great
as
to
cause
any
major
degree
of
uncertainty.
in
the
second
place,
even
if
it
was
great,
under
the
accrual
system
of
accounting,
if
the
dealer
lost
anything
by
virtue
of
a
depletion
of
the
reserve,
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
a
loss
in
the
year
in
which
that
loss
occurred.
now,
i
think
i've
used
practically
all
my
time.
i
think
that
is
the
basic
situation
before
us.
the
emphasis
of
the
taxpayers
is
upon
what
they
call
the
“contingencies”
or
the
probabilities
that
the
purchaser
would
default
and
that
the
dealer
would
then
have
to
step
in
to
the
breach
and
make
the
finance
company
whole.
of
course
that's
true
but,
from
our
point
of
view,
we
say
it's
irrelevant
to
this
issue,
irrelevant
to
this
issue.
we
think
this
case
doesn't
involve
contingencies
in
the
sense
in
which
the
taxpayer
dealers
refer
to
them.
we
think
this
case
involves
only
the
question,
are
there
such
uncertainties
that
this
dealer
will
not
receive
the
amounts
credited
to
him
which
were
part
of
a
note
payable
to
him
in
a
prior
separate
transaction.
are
there
such
uncertainties
that
this
court
cannot
say
--
or
that
this
court
must
say,
rather,
such
uncertainties
that
--
that
there
can
be
no
question
of
accrual?
we
think
the
records
in
no
way
would
support
that
hypothesis.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
on
whether
or
not
the
commissioner's
position
in
these
cases
glorifies
form
over
substance
was
the
subject
was
the
subject
of
some
comment
in
article
in
43
cornell
law
quarterly.
there,
the
editorial
comment
looked
to
the
decision
of
the
texas
trailer-coach
case
which
involved
the
sale
of
trailers
as
it
does
in
the
baird
case.
the
note
editor
concludes
and
we
think
that
this
is
a
correct
conclusion
calling
attention
to
judge
wisdom's
estimation
in
the
texas
trailer
case
that
the
commissioner
was
fascinated
by
the
form
and
overlooked
the
substance
of
the
transaction
as
my
brother
says,
he
said
that
it
was
submitted
that
this
criticism
applies
equally
well
to
his
own
analysis
which
stretch
--
stress
so
heavily
the
unitary
nature
of
the
transaction.
and
that
this
stress
of
form
over
substance
by
the
taxpayer
in
emphasizing
the
unitary
nature
of
the
transaction
was
demonstrated
by
a
consideration
of
the
situation
in
which
a
dealer
disposes
of
some
notes
by
subsequent
independent
sales
while
retaining
others.
in
such
a
case,
the
editor
says,
it
would
seem
to
be
clearly
necessary
to
accrue
the
full
value
of
the
notes
which
are
discounted
as
well
as
those
which
are
retained.
what
it
want
to
admit
is
this,
as
it
seems
the
court
must,
is
it
not
a
surrender
to
form
to
say
that
different
tax
consequences
for
discounted
note
should
follow
merely
because
the
two
sales
have
been
simplified
and
integrated
into
a
single
transaction.

dealing
with
a
decision
in
the
texas
trailer-coach
case.
mr.
meyer
rothwacks
i
shall
not
burden
the
court
in
this
rebuttal
with
a
restatement
of
the
government's
position.
i'd
like
merely
to
point
out
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
inquiry
as
to
the
government's
administrative
position
in
these
cases
that
it
has
been
a
perfectly
consistent
administrative
policy
ever
since
1931,
some
nine
years
before
the
first
litigated
case
in
this
area.
i
--
i
merely
adverted
to
the
1957
ruling
because
the
1957
ruling
spells
out,
and
it
was
very
helpful
indeed,
spells
out
the
nature
of
the
transactions
in
these
cases.
the
--
the
gcm
merely
stated
the
policy
and
it
stated
it
in
this
unequivocal
fashion.
it
observed
that
in
the
event
the
purchaser
fails
to
meet
his
obligation,
that
is
a
man
who
buys
the
car
or
buys
the
trailer,
the
dealer
is
given
the
benefit
of
the
reserved
credit
through
a
corresponding
reduction
in
his
liability
to
the
finance
company.
the
ruling
said
that
in
as
much
as
the
taxpayer
has
adopted
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
he
must
be
consistent
in
the
treatment
of
all
of
his
items
of
income.
such
treatment
under
the
accrual
method
demands
that
each
item
of
income
shall
be
accrued
when
earned
rather
than
when
received.
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
theory
of
accrual
is
founded
and
the
possibility
of
an
item
of
earned
income
not
being
received
due
to
some
unforeseen
circumstances
is
immaterial.
it
is
true,
the
commissioner
said,
that
where
an
entry
on
the
books
of
account
is
based
on
a
remote
contingency
which
may
never
happen
such
item
could
not
reasonably
be
accrued
for
income
tax
purposes.
the
contingency
must,
however,
be
something
more,
something
more
than
the
mere
possibility
of
the
debtor
not
satisfying
his
indebtedness.
the
facts
show
--
the
commissioner
said,
the
facts
show
that
the
reserved
credit
is
not
a
contingent
credit
but
is
paid
to
the
dealer
either
at
the
time
the
note
is
liquidated
by
the
purchaser
or
in
case
the
purchaser
fails
to
meet
his
obligation,
the
dealer
is
given
the
benefit
of
the
reserved
credit
through
a
corresponding
reducion
in
his
liability
to
the
finance
company.
now,
in
that
connection,
it
is
far
clearer
in
the
baird
case
than
in
glover
and
hansen
because
of
the
contractual
obligations
running
from
the
dealer
to
the
finance
company
on
the
separate
contract
entered
into
between
those
two
entities,
that
the
reserve
could
be
charged
when
there
was
a
loss
on
repossession,
that
the
reserved
to
be
charged
when
there
was
a
prepayment,
that
the
reserved
could
be
charged
on
account
of
any
indebtedness
whether
or
not
related
to
defense,
action
and
question
between
any
indebtedness
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company.
now,
in
that
circumstance,
in
that
circumstance,
it
becomes
all
the
more
evident
in
baird
than
it
was
in
glover
and
hansen,
that
the
dealer
will
either
get
the
amount
in
that
dealer's
reserved
in
cash
or
he
will
get
it
by
something
that
from
a
tax
point
of
view
is
the
equivalent
of
cash
and
that
is
the
discharge
of
his
obligations.
thank
you.
