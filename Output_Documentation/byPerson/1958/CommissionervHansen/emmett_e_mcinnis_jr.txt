mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
general
statutory
problem
presented
in
the
hansen
case,
and
that
is
set
forth
in
section
41
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
which
applies
to
the
tax
years
in
issue,
1951,
1952
and
1953.
that
section
is
set
forth
in
its
entirety
at
page
11
of
the
brief
for
the
respondent,
and
it
sets
the
general
ground
rule
here.
the
net
income
shall
be
computed
upon
the
basis
of
the
taxpayer's
annual
accounting
period
and
further
language
in
accordance
with
the
method
of
accounting
regularly
employed
in
keeping
the
books
of
such
taxpayer.
that
is
the
rule
and
the
qualification
follows.
but,
if
the
method
employed
does
not
clearly
reflect
the
income,
the
computation
shall
be
made
in
accordance
with
such
method
as
in
the
opinion
of
the
commissioner,
does
not
clearly
reflect
the
income
--
does
clearly
reflect
the
income.
it
is
not
for
the
opinion
of
the
commissioner
to
determine,
in
the
first
place,
whether
the
method
employed
does
clearly
reflect
the
income,
but
for
him,
if
it
does
not,
to
determine
which
one
does.
and,
the
basic
argument
for
this
respondent
both
before
the
ninth
circuit
where
he
won
the
unanimous
decision
and
here
is
that
his
method
of
accounting
does
clearly
reflect
his
income.
he
fears
no
question.
there
is
no
mystery
in
this
case,
nothing
too
complex
to
be
analyzed
and
presented
by
affirmatively
or
in
response
to
question.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
they
do,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
as
a
memorandum
account,
not
a
--
an
account
taken
into
income
or
expense
but
only
as
a
memorandum,
just
as
the
accounting
of
the
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
is
a
memorandum
accounting.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
no
change
affecting
this
case
in
--
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
--
in
any
way,
according
to
my
understanding.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
the
facts
in
the
hansen
case
require
some
clarification,
hitting
only
the
high
points
which
are
the
core
of
the
case.
yesterday,
in
the
presentation
of
the
facts,
there
was
repeated
mention
of
the
facts
of
the
schaeffer
case
and
of
the
baird
case
and
of
a
third
case
just
recently
decided,
so
recently
that
the
opinion
has
not
been
printed
in
airmail
services.
that
was
the
wiley
case.
now,
we
submit
that
the
case
before
the
court,
there
are
two,
but
the
case
before
the
court
in
this
consolidated
action
is
the
hansen
case
and,
in
30
minutes,
mr.
miller
will
be
arguing
the
glover
case.
and,
i
must
point
to
the
facts
in
the
hansen
case
in
order
to
clarify
exactly
what
is
at
issue
now.
there
is
no
note
--
no
promissory
note
in
favor
of
the
dealer.
there
is
no
other
commercial
paper
payable
to
the
dealer
and
no
account
receivable
arising
out
of
this
transaction
from
the
retail
auto
purchaser
to
the
dealer.
the
only
contract
in
issue
is
one
so
easily
found
that
we
do
not
even
require
the
index
because
it's
the
only
gatefold
in
the
hansen
record,
and
it
is
the
joint
exhibit
5e,
the
conditional
sales
contract.
and,
that
one
sheet
of
paper
mirrors
this
entire
transaction
with
but
one
exception.
the
exception
is
that
there
is
a
pre-existing
general
contract
in
this
case
not
specific
and
in
writing,
but
by
course
of
dealing
and
by
a
dealer's
manual
not
in
the
record
because
not
useful
to
the
record.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
pre-existing
contract
between
the
dealer
and
the
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
which
applies
to
all
of
his
credit
sales
and
did,
in
fact,
apply
to
every
credit
sale
in
the
three
tax
years
at
issue.
but,
the
contract
before
the
court
is
this
single
contract
which,
we
contend,
is
a
single
three-party
transaction,
and
i
shall
develop
that
in
detail.
i
want
to
point
out,
while
referring
to
joint
exhibit
5e,
that
the
payments
which
the
retail
purchaser
is
required
to
make
over
the
life
of
the
contract,
usually
18
months,
sometimes
24,
sometimes
36,
in
the
years
in
question
are
to
--
are
payments
to
be
made
at
the
office
of
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
the
amount
of
each
payment
is
filled
in
and
the
place
where
it
is
to
be
paid
is
filled
in
and,
while
it
does
not
specifically
state
that
the
payment
is
to
general
motors
acceptance
corporation,
that
follows
from
the
entire
context
and
the
practice.
the
payments
are
not
to
the
dealer.
the
dealer
has
no
account
receivable
from
the
retail
purchaser.
all
he
gets,
he
gets
from
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
from
this
prior
general
background
contract
which,
in
this
case,
i
have
shown
in
the
testimony
of
record,
is
a
course
of
dealing.
so
that,
there
is
no
receipt
of
an
account
receivable,
no
promissory
note,
or
other
negotiable
instrument
payable
to
the
dealer
in
the
hansen
case.
accordingly,
there
is
no
sale
of
paper
by
the
dealer
to
the
finance
company.
it
is
true
that,
at
the
foot,
at
the
base
of
joint
exhibit
5e,
there
is
an
assignment
of
all
rights
in
the
contract
by
the
dealer
to
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
but,
in
view
of
the
requirement
that
the
payments
be
made
at
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
and,
in
fact
--
in
practical
fact,
to
gmac,
we
view
this
as
a
recital
inserted
by
the
dominant
party
to
the
contract
with
the
stronger
bargaining
position
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
retained
right
from
this
contract
in
the
dealer
accepting
any
right
that
may
arise
on
his
course
of
dealing
with
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
gmac
does
accept
the
contract,
yes.
the
--
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
well,
the
--
their
acceptance
is
in
accordance
with
their
contract
with
the
dealer
that
they
will
accept
all
of
his
contracts
--
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
yes,
their
basic
contract
which
is
contingent
upon
their
approval
of
the
credit
status,
and
they
investigate
it
before
this
sale
can
be
made.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
in
effect,
they
are,
i
submit,
formal
parties
to
the
paper
but
not
in
the
sense
of
signing
the
piece
of
paper.
they
are
named
and
patent
parties.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
your
honor,
only
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
these
payments
are
actually
made
to
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
which
receives
them
month
by
month,
takes
custody
and
control
of
the
entire
payment.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
that
is
the
--
the
practical
effect
of
the
entire
course
of
dealing.
it
is
not
expressed
as
it
is
in
several
of
the
other
cases
before
the
court
where
that
contract
between
dealer
and
finance
company
is
clearly
specified.
here,
there
is
a
dealer's
manual
which
is
issued
and
it
is
partly
a
sales
argument
to
the
dealer
to
finance
for
gmac,
and
counsel
for
the
internal
revenue
service
has
examined
that
before
the
tax
court
and
we
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
specific
enough
to
make
it
useful
to
the
record.
so,
we
rely
upon
the
testimony
of
the
accountant
for
the
dealer
and
the
dealer
himself,
appearing
in
the
record
in
the
pages
following
30,
as
to
the
nature
of
the
course
of
dealing
and
the
contract
itself.
the
accrual
principle
is
a
crucial
importance
here,
and
it
is
--
it
is
agreed
by
both
sides
to
the
suit
that
the
--
a
key
case
is
the
spring
city
foundry
case
on
accrual
of
income.
income
accrues
upon
fixation
of
right
to
receive.and,
that
has
been
developed
a
little
further
in
the
north
american
oil
consolidated
case,
also
cited
in
the
brief,
that
there
must
be
a
claim
of
right
or
an
enforceable
claim
to
money
in
order
for
it
to
be
income
--
to
accrue
as
income
to
the
recipient.
he
doesn't
have
to
receive
it,
but
he
has
to
have
a
right
or
an
enforceable
claim
to
receive
it.
and,
we
submit
that
this
dealer
has
no
fixation
of
right
to
receive
the
reserve
at
the
time
the
car
is
sold
and
he
cannot
acquire
that
right
by
anything
else
than
the
satisfaction
of
--
over
a
period
of
many
months
of
the
specific
contingencies
to
which
his
right
to
any
of
that
reserve
is
subject,
and
there
are
three
of
those
contingencies.
yesterday,
the
statement
was
made
that
there
is
only
the
chance
that
the
debtor,
the
retail
purchaser,
will
be
unable
to
pay.
there
is,
of
course,
the
chance
that
he
might
be
unable
to
pay.
there
is
also
the
chance
that
the
chattel
will
be
destroyed,
and
this
is
a
conditional
sales
contract
with,
title
to
the
chattel
retained
in
the
seller,
the
dealer.
so
that,
recourse
to
this
chattel,
under
the
conditional
sales
contract,
might
prevent
a
loss
otherwise
chargeable
to
the
reserve
under
the
contract
between
the
dealer
and
the
finance
company.
and,
that
destruction
of
chattel
in
the
language
of
the
dealers
is
referred
to
as
“accelerated
depreciation
or
premature
depreciation”
and
it
occurs
when
a
purchaser
on
credit
is
involved
in
an
accident
which
demolishes
the
car.
then,
very
abruptly,
this
chattel
has
depreciated
in
value
below
the
remaining
debt
upon
the
car
and
recourse
to
the
chattel
sold
by
the
conditional
sales
contract
becomes
impossible.
there
is
a
third
contingency,
and
that
is
the
contingency
of
pre-payment.
in
our
blessed
land,
many
of
the
credit
purchasers
of
cars
receive
christmas
bonuses
or,
in
other
ways,
are
able
to
pre-pay
their
conditional
sales
contracts
and,
when
that
is
done,
this
reserve,
this
memorandum
account
on
the
books
of
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
must
be
--
there
must
be
subtracted
from
this
reserve
the
amount
of
unearned
interest
which
is
lost
by
the
pre-payment.
for
by
pre-paying,
the
retail
purchaser
saves
the
unearned
interest
upon
his
contract,
and
this
results,
as
the
testimony
of
the
dealer
shows
in
the
record,
in
loss
to
the
reserve
through
prepayment.
it
is
not
merely
hardship
upon
the
potential
inability
to
pay,
but
it
is
ability
to
pay
and
to
prepay
that
diminishes
the
reserve.
so,
there
are
specific
concrete
contingencies
which
decrease
the
size
of
this
memorandum
account,
this
unearned
interest,
upon
the
books
of
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
the
nature
of
this
dealer's
reserve
is
part
of
the
finance
charge.
it
is
unearned
income,
a
memorandum
contingent
credit.
it
is
due
--
it
is
not
even
due
at
the
sale
of
the
car.
it
is
due
in
monthly
installment
payments
of
a
specified
amount
in
the
filled-in
blank
on
exhibit
5e.
it's
due
month
by
month
and
not
at
the
time
of
sale
and
it
is,
in
the
accounting
concept,
unearned
or
deferred
income.
like
next
year's
salary
or
a
salary
of
man,
like
the
patronage
refund
credit
in
long
poultry
--
in
the
long
poultry
farms
case
cited
in
my
brief,
like
the
unearned
insurance
premium
in
leedy-glover
realty
or
the
oil
drilling
payments
in
commissioner
versus
edwards
which
is
one
of
a
number
of
useful
cases
cited
in
the
brief
amicus
filed
herein
by
the
national
automobile
dealers
association.
there
is
a
line
of
cases
there,
starting
with
page
9
and
going
through
page
14,
which
is
useful
but
cumulative
upon
this
principle.
there
are
summarily
unearned
advertising
commissions
in
the
telephone
directory
advertising
case.
there,
too,
the
concept
of
unearned
income.
now,
there
is
no
constructive
receipt.
this
theory
has
been
given,
perhaps,
undue
importance
here,
in
the
light
of
the
language
of
the
court
below,
pointing
out
that
the
doctrine
of
constructive
receipt
pertains
to
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
and
not
to
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer,
that
the
accrual
basis
taxpayer
is
governess
to
accrual
by
fixation
of
the
right
to
receive
by
enforceable
claim
of
right.
but,
even
if
we
disregard
this
accounting
distinction,
there
has
been
no
constructive
receipt
here
anyway
under
the
terms
of
the
treasury's
own
regulation
118
which
points
out
that,
in
order
for
there
to
be
constructive
receipt,
the
income
must
be
available
to
the
recipient.
it
must
be
within
his
power
and
control
or
subject
to
be
drawn
upon
by
him
at
any
time.
and,
the
testimony
of
the
dealer
and
of
his
certified
public
accountant
in
the
record
in
the
hansen
case
makes
it
clear
that
he
could
not
draw
upon
that
money
and
had
no
access
to
it.
this
testimony
was
unrebutted,
was
not
compromised
upon
cross-examination.
glancing
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
37
of
the
hansen
record,
the
certified
public
accountant
had
this
to
say.
“no,
there
definitely
was
not,
in
my
opinion,
any
constructive
receipt
of
income
until
he
was
paid
the
money.
he
had
no
access
to
it
in
any
way
until
general
motors
decided
to
pay
it.
he
might
have
had
and
did
and
have
--
he
might
have
had
many
thousands
of
dollars
and
did
have
many
thousands
of
dollars
predated
to
this
reserve.
but,
as
far
as
his
ability
to
even
borrow
against
it
or
receive
it
in
any
form,
he
had
absolutely
no
privilege
or
recourse
to
it
at
all.”
“when
did
such
a
right
accrue
to
him?”
“when
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
set
him
--
sent
him
a
check
for
the
amount
that
they
decided
he
should
have
of
that
reserve.”
and,
in
passing,
let
me
point
out
that
any
amount
to
which
he
was
entitled
under
his
contract
with
gmac
was
excess
over
the
5%
cushion.
this
was
the
question
suggested
--
or
this
was
suggested
by
the
question
from
mr.
justice
douglas,
yesterday,
as
to
whether
he
was
certain
ever
to
get
the
5%.
the
answer
is
that
general
motors
acceptance
corporation,
in
its
day-to-day
accounting
experience,
cited
that
5%
was
about
what
those
losses
would
run.
5%
of
the
total
contracts
outstanding
for
this
dealer's
customers
and
that
they
required
that
to
be
kept
there
for
their
own
protection
and
safety.
it
was
a
genuine
reserve
against
loss
and
not
a
reserve
of
profit.
that
5%,
in
all
likelihood,
would
never
get
to
the
--
or
could
never
be
paid
to
the
dealer
unless
he
went
out
of
business
and
all
of
the
debts
were
closed
out
--
all
the
contracts
were
closed
and
then
there
was
something
left,
but
it's
the
excess
over.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor.
and,
i
might
mention
that
it
is
unilaterally
variable
by
the
dominant
party.
this
is
not
of
the
record,
so,
i
shall
not
express
it
further.
but,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record,
however,
at
the
very
outset
in
the
tax
court
as
to
the
nature
of
that
agreement.
“can
you
tell
us
in
some
detail
just
what”
--
on
page
30
of
the
hansen
record,
at
the
top,
testimony
of
john
r.
hansen.
“can
you
tell
us
in
some
detail
just
what
happened
when
a
customer
purchased
a
car
upon
credit
for
you
--
from
you
in
those
years?”
“well,
we
figured
the
cash
price
on
the
car,
deducted
his
down
payment,
and
then
computed
what
the
finance
cost
would
be
on
the
unpaid
balance
and
what
the
monthly
payments
would
be.
and,
in
any
event
that
the
contract
was
paid
up
in
advance,
he
would
get
a
rebate
on
the
finance
which
would
be
charged
both
to
my
dealer
reserve
and
to
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.”
and,
perhaps
more
effectively,
here
on
the
following
page
31,
“well,
we
have
more
reserve
for
the
more
outstanding
we
have
and,
as
the
outstanding
goes
down,
well,
they
give
us
anything
in
excess
of
5%.”
“was
it
5%
of
outstanding
conditional
sales
contracts
in
the
three
years
at
issue
1951,
1952
and
1953?”
“yes.”
that
is
the
limit
of
the
participation
by
the
dealer
and
is
set
forth,
actually,
in
the
oral
testimony
in
the
record
which
is
briefed.
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
i
believe
that
there
is
--
that
the
difference
lies
merely
in
the
clarity
and
strength
of
these
facts
and
that
it
is
a
--
that,
in
both
situations,
i
believe
that
the
dealer
is
entitled
--
is
entitled
to
treat
this
as
unearned
income
rather
than
as
earned
income.
and,
that
takes
us
squarely
into
the
point
of
constructive
receipt
which
was
argued,
“is
there
a
constructive
receipt
of
income
by
virtue
of
the
argument
that,
sooner
or
later,
this
reserve
must
either
be
paid
in
cash
to
the
dealer
or
must
satisfy
an
obligation
of
the
dealer
to
the
finance
company?”
that
is
a
persuasive
and
a
rather
formidable
argument,
at
first
conjecture,
and
here
is
how
it
is
to
be
met.
let
us
take
a
hypothetical
question.
if
a
warrants
that
b
will
pay
c,
whereupon
a
becomes
contingently
liable
for
the
payment
as
secondary
liability
in
case
the
party
primarily
liable
does
not
pay.
if
a
warrants
that
b
will
pay
c
and
b
does
pay
c,
then,
has
a
received
taxable
income?our
answer
is
of
course
not.
he
had
merely
avoided
a
potential
liability
which
never
became
a
liability.
he
is
in
the
same
position
as
counsel
descending
the
staircase
of
a
building
who
may
stumble.
if
he
falls,
he
may
incur
--
he
will
incur
a
potential
liability
for
hospital
expenses.
but,
if
he
catches
his
balance,
he
avoids
that
future
or
potential
liability.
has
he
received
--
has
he
accrued
taxable
income
merely
because
he
succeeded
in
not
falling?
he
has
avoided
a
future
loss
and
it
is
not
a
present
or
existing
liability
that
has
been
avoided,
but
a
possible
future
one
at
a
later
date.
does
that
satisfy
the
line
of
inquiry,
mr.
justice
whittaker?
mr.
emmett
e.
mcinnis,
jr.
we
distinguish
that,
your
honor,
as
a
distinct
case
for
the
reason
that
this
is,
as
held
below,
a
single
three-party
transaction,
as
i
would
like
to
develop
right
now.
there
have
to
--
there
are
and
there
have
to
be,
in
realistic
absolute
practical
substance,
three
parties
to
this
conditional
sales
contract.
the
reason
why
is
that
the
purchaser
on
credit
doesn't
have
the
money
to
pay
for
the
car.
the
dealer
cannot
buy
the
car
and
sell
it
on
credit
directly.
that
would
be
the
bank
situation
where
he
would
have
a
--
an
account
receivable.
he
can't
do
that
because
he
doesn't
have
the
money
and
the
facts
and
testimony
show
that
he
never
made
a
credit
sale
in
three
years
that
way.
so,
there
has
to
be
someone
to
supply
the
money,
and
that
is
the
finance
company,
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
the
retail
purchaser
buys
two
things.
he
buys
a
car
from
the
dealer
whose
job
is
to
secure
the
car
and
to
sell
it,
and
he
buys
credit
from
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
by
this
very
contract
and
the
underlying
contract.
and,
the
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
sells
credit
for
a
finance
charge
and
the
dealer
sells
the
car
for
the
price
of
the
car.
now,
he
gets
the
price
of
the
car
in
trade-in
from
the
purchaser
or
down
payment,
partly,
and
the
rest
of
the
price
he
gets
by
return
mail
from
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
the
reserve
is
a
contingent
added
consideration
to
the
dealer
for
doing
business
with
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
rather
than
with
some
other
source
of
credit.
so,
there
are
three
parties
to
the
one
contract,
and
it
is
a
single
contract
and
not
a
two
--
a
two-transaction
hypothesis
or
not
a
two
--
a
double-transaction
of
sale
of
a
car
and
then
sale
of
paper.
it
is
simultaneous.
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
appears
on
the
face
of
the
contract.
in
every
credit
sale
through
the
three
years
in
issue,
it
was
general
motors
acceptance
corporation,
and
the
retail
purchaser
knows
it
because
his
obligation
is
to
go
there
and
pay
his
money
each
month
for
18
or
36
months.
respondents
never
acquired
an
account
receivable
from
the
purchaser
because
this
was
a
single
three-party
transaction
and
that
is
a
point
just
made.
now,
the
point
as
for
the
rather
formidable
suggestion
has
been
made
that
this
case,
as
argued
and
as
established
in
four
circuits
already
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
would
destroy
the
accrual
concept
of
accounting
or
would
endanger
the
accrual
concept
with
danger
to
the
federal
treasury.
but,
this
is
not
so
because
this
is
consistent
with
the
accrual
concept.
it
does
not,
in
the
first
place,
affect
the
great
volume
of
sales
on
credit.
let
us
take
a
two-party
sales
on
credit
where
the
seller
is
also
the
creditor.
if
a
man
buys
on
open
account
from
a
department
store,
he
owes
the
department
store
and,
certainly,
the
department
store
must
accrue
what
he
owes.
but,
this
is
a
situation
with
a
third
party
supplying
the
credit
under
distinct
and
under
contracts
which
make
the
obligation
to
the
third
party.
income
will
still
accrue
in
the
normal
debtor-creditor
transaction
and
will
still
be
taxable
as
it
accrues,
but
not
before.
the
case
authority
supports
the
dealer
taxpayer
strongly,
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief
for
respondents.
the
blaine
johnson
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
with
two
cases
following
it,
decided
upon
stipulation
without
oral
argument
or
briefing,
the
texas
trailer-coach
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
with
four
cases
following
it,
again,
on
stipulation
without
oral
argument
or
briefing.
west
pontiac,
modern
olds,
kilborn,
and
hines-pontiac,
these,
i
suspect,
conform
on
our
side
to
the
wiley
case,
so
recently
decided
in
the
sixth
circuit
following
the
schaffer
case
on
the
other.
it's
only
conjecture,
however,
since
the
printed
opinion
is
not
available
to
counsel
as
yet.
the
glover
case
in
that
eighth
circuit
establishes
the
same
rule
for
the
eighth
circuit
as
the
hansen
case
before
the
court
now
in
the
ninth
circuit.
there
are
other
earlier
cases
which
are
closely
similar
in
principle,
and
are
set
forth
in
my
brief
at
page
18
and
19,
dealing
with
asbestos
retailers'
reserves
and,
again,
a
maintenance
percentage
on
paving
contracts.
the
only
reason
why
the
facts
of
these
are
not
drawn
before
the
court
is
that
there
is
a
limitation
of
time
and
attention
imposed
by
the
time.
i
want
to
make
a
point
of
the
inconsistent
tax
treatment
of
the
other
parties
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
it's
consist
--
it
is
correct
tax
treatment
but
it
is
inconsistent
with
that
which
has
been
imposed
upon
the
dealers.
what
about
the
retail
purchaser?
he
is
going
to
be
paying
interest
on
this
purchase
on
his
borrowing,
his
credit.
he's
going
to
be
paying
at
over
18
or
24
or
36
months
in
equal
installments.
what
does
the
commissioner
let
him
do?
he
has
a
choice.
he
either
declares
--
he
can
either
deduct
his
interest
expense
as
he
actually
incurred,
or
he
can
capitalize
all
of
his
interest
expense
as
part
of
the
value
of
the
car
and
then
amortize
it
over
the
life
of
the
car
under
ordinary
amortization
rules.
so,
he
can't
deduct
all
these
interests
at
the
date
of
the
sale
and
the
finance
company
is
not
required
to
declare
its
part
of
the
--
of
the
finance
charges
as
income
at
the
date
of
the
sale.
the
finance
company
is
allowed
to
treat
his
income
a
proportionate
share
of
the
interest
as
each
payment
is
made
by
the
purchaser
month
by
month,
perhaps,
for
36
months
on
a
30
--
on
a
three-year
contact
and
for
longer
in
a
trailer
coach
contract.
the
finance
company
has
as
--
accrues
his
income
by
the
permission
of
the
commissioner,
as
shown
in
the
motor
securities
case,
only
the
interest
as
the
interest
is
earned.
and,
the
purchaser
can
deduct
it
only
as
the
interest
is
incurred
and,
yet,
the
dealer
is
asked
to
pay
income
tax
on
interest
which
is
not
earned
and
which
he
may
never
receive
because
of
losses
chargeable
to
it
before
he
has
any
fixed
right
to
it.
there
is
a
--
an
inconsistency.
my
portion
of
the
time
is
up
and
i
shall
submit
to
the
court.
thank
you.
