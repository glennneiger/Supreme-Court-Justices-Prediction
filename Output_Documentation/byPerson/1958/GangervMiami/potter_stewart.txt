justice
potter
stewart
up
to
this
--
excuse
me,
mr.
anderson,
up
to
this
point,
should
--
you'd
--
you'd
won
in
--
in
both
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
accept
your
original
complaint
which
to
--
which
you've
already
called
our
attention.
you'd
had
no
occasion
to
complain
about
any
constitutional
deprivation
until
this
time.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
--
that
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
your
adversary's
petition
for
rehearing
--
justice
potter
stewart
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
potter
stewart
on
which
they
finally
prevailed,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
went
their
way
that
time.
justice
potter
stewart
then
--
and
then
what
you
just
read
us
here
on
page
65
of
the
record
is
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
subsequent
petition
for
rehearing.
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
court
has
gone
against
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
have
you
--
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
your
complaint
didn't
refer
to
the
second
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
how
about
your
florida
practice?
is
there
reamendment
or
implicit
amendment
to
confirm
and
approve,
amendment
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
before
the
trial
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
before
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
that
didn't
say
a
word
about
anybody
paying
for
them,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
but
all
i
have
in
mind
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
start
with
this.
that
we
notice
on
top
of
page
90
that
says
that
anybody
interested
is
hereby
notified
that
the
paving
job
is
completed.
and
if
he
wants
to
--
to
know
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
object
to
it
--
to
the
acceptance
of
that
job
by
the
city
manager
where
it
come
down,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
assessment.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
if
this
--
if
this
notice
at
all
an
issue
in
this
case
that's
my
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
may
i
ask,
what
is
this
notice
on
page
94?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
was
that
published?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
often
was
that
published?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
noticed
it's
captioned,
“preliminary
assessment
roll.”
is
there
any
notice
of
a
final
assessment
roll?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
then
is
this
the
last
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that's
published
twice
at
what
interval?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
reread
that
opinion
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
last
five
minutes
and
i
couldn't
find
such
holding.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
those
cases
stand
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
proposition?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
federal
question
placed
by
the
failure
of
a
state
to
give
an
abiding
property
owner
an
opportunity
to
continue.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
just
ask
one
basic
question.
what
was
the
prejudice
that
resulted
from
the
lack
of
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
no,
not
entirely
because
was
--
was
the
basic
objection
that
this
was
the
kind
of
an
improvement
that
could
not
be
levied
against
abiding
property
owners
or
was
the
basic
--
or
was
there
also
an
objection
that
even
if
an
assessment
against
the
abiding
owners
was
proper
that
the
equalization
procedure,
whatever
you
call
it
in
miami,
the
apportionment,
as
justice
black
has
called
it,
was
unfair?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
therefore
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
challenge
is
--
the
challenge
is
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
an
approvement
--
improvement
that
could
be
paid
for
at
all
by
assessing
the
abiding
property
owners,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
--
excuse
me.
let
me
ask
me
one
further
question,
following
my
first.
without
--
without
going
into
detail
as
to
which
justice
--
to
which
judges
of
the
florida
supreme
court
defected
to
the
enemy
and
which
came
back
over
your
side
and
so
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
--
what
was
the
basis
of
that
court's
ultimate
decision?
did
it
reach
the
merits
of
your
claim
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
--
may
i
ask
one
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
but
i
think
maybe
i
can
clarify,
at
least
in
my
own
mind.
is
your
basic
claim
that
you
were
denied
due
process
procedurally
because
you
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
make
this
contention
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
florida?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
--
that
was
the
purpose
of
my
first
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
to
where
the
prejudice
was.
