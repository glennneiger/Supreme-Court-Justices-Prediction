mr.
herbert
l.
nadeau
mr.
chief
justice,
to
please
the
court.
i
will,
but
briefly,
dwell
upon
one
phase
of
this
case
which
occurred
after
the
case
was
initially
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
quite
by
an
accident
from
an
article
appearing
in
the
miami
herald,
it
was
observed
that
the
city
had
decided
not
to
make
any
further
special
assessment
for
repaving.
that
was
in
connection
with
two
other
districts.
so,
we
petitioned
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county,
florida
for
a
leave
to
take
the
deposition
of
the
officers
of
the
defendant's
city.
that
motion
was
granted
and
we
proceeded
to
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
george
shaw,
financial
director
of
the
city
of
miami.
and
in
the
course
of
that
deposition,
it
was
conceded
our
--
this
--
this
motion
appears
at
page
58
of
the
record.
mr.
herbert
l.
nadeau
pardon
sir?
mr.
herbert
l.
nadeau
no,
sir.
this
occurred
after
we
had
won
the
case
in
the
circuit
court.
after
the
case
had
been
argued
in
the
supreme
court
and
when
this
matter
came
to
our
attention,
we
got
leave
of
the
circuit
court,
which
is
our
lower
court,
to
take
the
deposition.
and
then
we
sought
to
supplement
the
record
on
appeal
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
herbert
l.
nadeau
it
was
after
the
--
it
was
after
the
first
decision
in
our
favor,
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
l.
nadeau
of
the
supreme
court,
yes,
sir.
and
i
might
say,
i
believe,
it
was
after
they
had
announced
that
they
were
going
to
hear
--
had
granted
the
city's
petition
for
rehearing,
but
before
it
had
been
acted
upon.
now,
that
motion
sets
forth
the
fact
that
darlow
or
that
shaw
wrote
a
letter
to
darlow
with
respect
to
district
508.
informing
him
that
--
that
resurfacing
was
not
going
to
be
subject
to
a
special
assessment,
but
it
was
going
to
be
paid
out
the
proceeds
of
a
bond
issued
to
be
guaranteed
by
revenues
from
the
florida
power
&
light
company.
it
is
also
significant
in
that
letter
that
the
city
admits
that
their
procedures
there
were
void
because
they
said,
"consequently,
after
the
district
was
ordered
and
confirmed,
we
purposely
failed
to
adhere
to
the
charter
requirement
of
hearing
objections
on
the
completed
work.
thus,
in
effect,
made
the
district
invalid
as
far
as
the
assessments
were
concerned."
and
then
proceeded
in
the
next
paragraph
to
say
that
the
city
attorney's
office
had
advice
them
not
to
do
anything
about
the
liens
with
respect
to
this
new
district
508,
until
this
other
litigation
was
disposed
of
referring
to
hamilton
and
ganger
which
were
447
and
503.
now,
the
significance
of
this
matter
is
this,
in
the
hamilton
case
which
is
477
and
the
ganger
case
which
is
503,
we
are
dealing
with
downtown
streets
in
the
city
of
miami.
the
city
of
miami,
the
hub
of
it,
is
the
corner
of
flagler
street
and
north
miami
avenue.
and
the
avenues
go
north
and
the
avenues
go
south.
north
miami
--
north
and
south
miami
avenue
room
--
run
right
up
to
the
heart
of
town.
in
this
district
477,
they
levied
an
assessment
on
these
downtown
streets
against
these
abutting
property
owners.
but
when
they
come
to
district
508,
which
connects
with
north
miami
avenue,
a
very
street
which
was
inbound
in
477
and
in
fact,
took
up
where
district
477
left
off,
they
didn't
make
an
assessment.
they
paid
it
on
the
general
funds.
and
the
logic
of
that
is
in
the
reverse,
because
the
further
north
you
get
to
miami
avenue,
the
further
out
you
are
from
the
heart
of
town.
if
logic
were
to
prevail
in
this
situation,
it
was
the
downtown
property
that
should've
been
paid
out,
general
funds
and
not
the
further
outlying
districts.
i
say
to
this
court
that
i
have
never
seen
a
municipality
impose
liens
with
such
ranked
discrimination
as
has
been
shown
with
respect
to
these
two
districts.
thank
you.
