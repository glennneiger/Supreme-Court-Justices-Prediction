justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
it
raised
in
the
complaint?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong,
i
thought
that
the
complaint
dealt
only
with
the
first
notice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
first
notice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
the
subsequent
action
of
the
supreme
court
mean
granting
the
appellant's
motion
to
strike
that
brief
within
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
it
was
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
was
this
proceeding
had
ended?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
this
proceeding
had
ended
with
the
decision
in
your
favor
in
the
--
in
the
nisi
prius
court,
no
appeal
taken,
could
the
city
not
--
notwithstanding,
had
come
along
on
the
second
stage
of
its
assessment
proceeding
and
say
well,
all
right,
we're
going
to
assess
you,
so
as
to
put
you
in
a
position,
therefore,
where
you
had
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
subsequent
notice
as
distinguished
in
the
first
notice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
my
problem
--
my
question
is
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
problem
or
not.
up
to
that
time,
you
had
raised
in
your
complaint
only
the
first
notice.
and
as
i
understand,
your
--
prior,
the
supreme
court
said
either
in
his
first
or
second
opinion,
you
were
too
late
in
raising
the
validity
of
the
second
notices
--
the
second
notice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
haven't
found
anything
that
indicates
that
you
ever
attacked
the
second
notice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
if
you're
attacked
on
the
first
notice,
it
was
not
sufficient
to
put
you
out
from
under
the
assessment,
absent
and
attack
on
the
second
notice.
what
difference
does
it
make
that
whether
the
first
notice
was
good
or
bad?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
in
other
words,
when
you
say
the
first
notice
was
immaterial
that
means
--
does
that
mean
that
even
though
the
first
notice
was
bad
and
the
second
notice
was
good,
you
still
could
be
--
you
still
could
be
assessed,
under
your
law,
was
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
be
good?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you
have
--
you
have
to
get
rid
of
the
second
notice
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
order
to
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
you
prevail
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
would
be
your
local
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
just
--
just
a
detail,
would
you
mind
putting
your
finger
on
the
record,
the
pages
of
record
where
you
attack
the
second
notice?i
can't
find
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
anywhere
else?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
where
is
it?
your
attack
on
the
notice
is
--
is
brought
in
by
the
defendant's
answer
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
true
you
raised
it
on
your
petition
for
rehearing.
and
that's
true
that
you
got
leave
to
file
a
special
brief.
but
it
also
seems
to
be
true
that
after
you
filed
a
brief
on
the
constitutional
issue,
the
federal
constitution
issue
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
struck
it
and
that
leads
me
to
inquire
whether
they
might
have
struck
it
on
a
state
ground,
namely,
that
your
failure
to
attack
the
second
notice
had
been
untimely
or
could
could've
ever
been
made
it
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
--
as
the
copy
of
your
motion
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
papers
are
here
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
even
if
the
first
notice
was
bad
that
he
is
--
he
isn't
entitled
to
any
relief
and
as
you
can
show
the
second
notice
was
there.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
got
this
copy
of
this
motion
you're
reading
about.
what
does
the
first
paragraph
of
the
motion
refer
to?
you
say
there
that
the
court,
on
november
21st,
1957,
denied
the
appellee's
motion
for
leave
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
file
a
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
written
motion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
briefs
--
are
the
briefs
on
the
two
appeals
to
the
florida
supreme
court
here
in
our
files?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
never
mind
about
that
but
for
myself,
and
this
is
a
different
feeling
on
the
bench,
i'd
like
to
see
those
briefs.
