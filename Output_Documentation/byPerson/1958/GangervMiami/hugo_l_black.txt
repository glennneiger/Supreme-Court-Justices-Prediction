how
do
they
get
the
notice
from?
justice

the
tax
roll?
justice

but
there's
no
notice
given
to
them
by

at
the
time
when
they
would
look
at
their
technical
assessment.
is
it
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
special
on
this.
i
noticed
two
publications
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
set
to
be
up.
justice
hugo

black
is
it
for

justice
hugo

black
how
would
a
man
living
in
6500
north
7th
avenue,
if
you
have
one,
know
that
it's
--
it
was
his
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
they
file
their
challenge
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
had
the
city
began
to
collect
taxes
through
these
funds
on
the
second?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'll
just
ask
you
a
few
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
anything
else.
if
this
--
does
this
improvement
extend
on
the
north
side
of
miami
to
the
south
side,
going
on
down
to
brickell
avenue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
true
--
is
this
the
basis
of
the
controversy
of
the
truth?
justice
hugo

beside
the
north
side
and
with
the
south
side
and
going
down
there
to
the
key
west

to
the
brickell
avenue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
the
highways
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
definitely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
on
page
60
that
this
maybe
a
misprint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
another
district,
if
i
may
interrupt.
that's
the
other
district
which
was
formed
afterwards
which
i
complained
about
in
my
argument.
that
was
actually
the
two
districts.
so,
i
went
with
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
if
the
legislature
had
decided
to
make
one-half
the
property
owners
on
a
street
going
through
a
city,
just
pick
out
every
odd
one
and
let
them
pay
and
not
let
anybody
else
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you
would
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you
would
have
had
to
judge
it
by
the
face
of
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
is
applied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
determine
the
benefit
under
the
statute?
i'm
asking
because
i
don't
quite
understand
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
reach
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
haven't
determined
the
amount.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
that
they
have
determined
that
it's
a
benefit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
one
question
there
because
you
bring
up
another
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
have
a
right
to
go
into
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
after
a
certain
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
they
didn't
have
a
notice,
how
could
they
go?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
unable
to
follow
you
completely
on
that
statement.
as
justice
frankfurter
suggests,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
two
problems.
number
one,
did
they
raise
this
question?
of
course,
that
is
here.
number
two,
i
do
not
understand
you
to
argue
here
that
merely
because
the
legislature
passes
an
act
which
says
that
a
taxpayer
shall
pay
in
accordance
to
the
good
that's
done
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
that
dispenses
with
any
notice
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
on
the
individual
--
when
the
state
divides
it
up,
the
benefits
among
the
different
people,
that
the
property
holder
is
not
entitled
any
notice
before
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
benefit
is
passed
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
so,
but
maybe
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
jurisdiction
perspective?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
bound
by
florida?
do
i
understand
that
you
are
saying
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
affirmed
these
findings
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
that
court
decide
as
the
findings
of
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
did
the
majority
of
the
court
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying,
if
i
can
understand
it,
are
you
saying
that
in
the
first
opinion,
the
court
approved
the
findings
of
facts
and
in
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
it's
implicit
in
it,
are
you
saying
that
in
the
second
opinion,
they
didn't
discuss
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
facts
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
7?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
act
itself
provide
for
any
apportionment
of
the
burden
on
the
taxpayer's
prescribing
--
on
the
land
owners
prescribing
exactly
how
it
should
be
proportioned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
it
was
the
way
it
was
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
--
authorized
by
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
be
sure.
you
have
no
challenge
to
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
street
in
front
of
the
dupont
building
was
--
the
owner
of
it
was
charged
according
to
the
front-foot,
the
same
as
the
street
of
the
homeowner
three
miles
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
such
challenges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
gist
of
your
contention
there
then
that
the
state
or
city,
as
imposed
benefit,
has
said
that
each
one
who
was
benefited
must
be
--
must
pay
it?
and
your
contention
is
that
the
state
has
no
constitutional
authority
under
the
federal
constitution
to
impose
that
burden
on
you
according
to
benefit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
as
you
indicated
a
while
ago
that
if
the
legislature
reaches
a
conclusion
that
a
whole
street
should
be
paved
or
resurfaced
and
reaches
the
conclusion
that
that
will
benefit
the
property
owners,
that
it
doesn't
have
the
constitutional
power
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
the
basis
of
your
contention?
