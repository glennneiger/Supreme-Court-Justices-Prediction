mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
becomes
necessary
for
me,
due
to
the
statements
that
have
been
made
to
you,
to
tell
you
that
i'm
sure
counsel
probably
has
forgotten
what
transpired,
but
statements
had
been
made
to
you
here
that
are
not
in
accordance
with
the
record
in
this
cause.
justice
harlan
asked
the
question
here
as
to
why
the
appellant's
brief.
it
was
the
appellee
then
and
the
supreme
court
was
stricken.
it
was
stricken
on
the
motion
of
this
city
that
no
constitutional
question
was
decided
by
the
trial
court
and
that
this
matter
was
not
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
until
a
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
it
is
not
in
this
record.
we
didn't
make
any
interest
into
the
record
because
we
didn't
know
at
that
time
that
such
a
position
would
be
taken
in
this
brief,
but
we
are
certainly
willing
for
the
court
to
get
the
truth
of
this
for
one
to
be
filed.
we'll
let
counsel
file
his
copy
with
this
court.
because
all
we
want
you
to
get
is
the
facts
and
we
are
perfectly
willing
for
that
to
be
done.
now,
the
second
thing
here
is
this.
you
will
notice
in
his
brief,
or
in
their
brief,
where
they
set
forth
to
you
that
the
supreme
court
entertain
their
petition
for
rehearing
and
allowed
a
brief
to
be
filed.
now,
that
implies
to
you
and
leads
you
to
believe
that
they
considered
such
a
brief.
they
don't
then
tell
you
in
their
brief
that
it
was
stricken,
but
it
--
it
could
be
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
lead
you
to
believe
that
such
a
brief
was
considered.
when
in
all
truth
and
fact,
it
was
stricken.
now,
the
next
thing
to
give
you
the
history
of
this
and
i
say
this
as
to
this
record.
i
didn't
think
it
would
help
it
any
to
bring
all
of
the
other
case
up
here.
now
counsel
prepared
this
record
--
prepared
and
its
two
appeals,
one
of
them
is
refer
to
as
the
ganger
appeal
and
one
of
them
is
the
hamilton
appeal.
now,
you'll
notice
from
the
record
that
he
prepared
--
he
brings
up
the
complaint
to
you
in
the
hamilton
case.
yet,
the
ganger
case
is
the
one
that
the
supreme
court
applied
or
handed
down
the
lengthy
decision
on.
the
other
one,
the
hamilton
case
was
affirmed
on
authority
of
the
ganger
case.
now,
when
you
look
at
the
notices
in
the
back
as
to
the
exhibits
and
i
want
to
give
you
how
many
of
those
notices
there
were,
he's
got
--
he
lost
it
with
the
first
one,
the
hamilton
case,
he
picks
up
in
those
notices
there
to
the
ganger
case.
now,
here
is
the
way
this
works,
the
city
charter
is
an
act
to
the
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
i
don't
imply
that
it's
any
difference
between
the
complaints
other
than
the
dates
of
the
notice.
in
other
words,
when
you
see
the
notices
in
the
back
under
the
ganger
decision,
it
shows
you
a
longer
period.
and
that's
what
i'm
coming
at,
as
to
how
long
they
did
have
before
these
assessments
became
final.
now,
the
city
charter
is
an
act
of
the
legislature
that
was
enacted
here
in
1925,
because
the
city
is
a
creature
of
the
state.
now,
the
first
notice
of
--
of
a
resolution
being
passed
on
assessment
in
the
ganger
case,
it
was
on
the
hamilton's
--
let's
see,
this
is
the
hamilton
case.
it
was
published
on
march
the
4th,
1950,
that's
the
first
notice.
it
sets
forth
that
the
city
commission
will
meet
at
a
time
certain
in
the
future,
at
least,
i
believe,
10
days
away.
and
they
are
--
at
that
time,
the
matter
of
the
assessment
will
come
up.
that's
the
first
thing.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
sir,
the
resolution
announcing
the
assessment.
now,
that
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
this
is
for
street
improvement.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
no,
that
comes
later.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i'll
tell
you
how
--
how
this
works,
so
if
you
will
understand.
now,
that
--
that
came
in
march
the
4th,
1950.
this
amended
complaint
was
filed
december
the
2nd,
1953
in
the
hamilton
case.
now,
that's
the
first
thing.
he
has
assessed
what
had
to
be
done
in
one
of
those
cases.
nobody
appeared
there
to
object.
then,
the
advertisements
are
made
by
publication
on
bids.
anybody
can
come
and
object
to
that
because
those
people
who
have
paid,
they've
got
a
right
to
know
what
this
is
going
to
cost.
then
later
when
that
work
is
completed,
it
is
published
and
they
have
that
before
the
city
accepts
the
job
and
paid
the
contract.
because
if
that
work
hadn't
been
done
properly,
the
property
owners
there
have
a
right
to
object.
now,
after
all
that
is
done,
specifications
and
everything
and
these
notices
have
been
--
it's
been
stated
that
they
only
filed
with
the
city
clerk.
anybody
can
go
examine
it.
now,
the
last
thing
they
do
before
it
becomes
final
is
the
tax
role
on
notice
is
published
on
the
preliminary
tax
role.
and
everybody
is
given
a
chance
to
come
and
then
--
and
object
whether
or
not,
they
have
ever
objected
before.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
that
means
at
that
time,
they
get
up
the
tax
role.
this
property
may
have
changed
hands
reason
--
in
other
words,
it
would
be
very
cumbersome
to
the
city,
property
changes
hence,
oftenly.
if
you
have
to
go
down
and
check
the
owner
each
time,
it
would
be
a
costly
proposition
which
they
would
end
up
paying
for
property
owner.
but
this
last
publication
then
is
on
the
tax
role.
that's
--
that's
--
give
it
to
you
as
to
what
it's
going
to
cost
you.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
by
publication.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
the
tax
roll
are
two
--
there's
two
publications
on
this,
the
only
notice
that
the
other
side
of
tax
was
the
first
notice
of
the
assessment
which
is
published
once.
this
last
one
is
published
twice,
two
successive
weeks.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
you
see
they
haven't
paid
for
this
yet.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
because
nobody
has
paid
after
the
work
is
accepted.
the
city
goes
on
and
pays
for
all
this
way.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
and
then
they
just
get
their
money
back
from
the
taxpayer.
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
twice.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
it's
published
in
a
local
newspaper
and
the
statute
sets
out
what
kind
of
newspaper
ought
to
be.
in
--
in
the
matter
of
fact
here,
the
record
shows,
it
was
published
by
the
miami
herald
and
the
miami
news,
the
herald
being
the
largest
paper
in
florida
and
the
news
being
the
second
largest
in
that
part
of
its
state.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
it
--
it
gives
you
the
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
i
would
leave
this
to
you
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
sir?
this,
in
other
words
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
this
--
this
happens
to
be
--
i
just
picked
out
the
first
notice
i
have
which
is
page
90
of
the
transcript.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes
sir,
this
notice
to
property
owners.
"all
interested
will
take
notice
that
paving
work
on
south
miami
avenue
from
south
west
15th
road,
to
200
feet
or
more
or
less,
south
of
alatka
street,
designated
highway
improvement
district
case
503
has
been
completed."
and
that
a
meeting
of
the
city
commission
at
9:30
a.m.
on
june
the
3rd,
1953,
their
objections
will
be
heard
to
the
acceptance
thereof
of
the
--
by
the
commission.
now
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
you
want
me
to
read
them
all
to
you
here?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
this
--
the
statute
says
that.
we
don't
have
to
publish
state
statutes.
this
is
a
state
statute
creating
the
city
of
miami
and
this
statute
specifically
sets
out
the
only
way
assessments
can
be
done.
it's
not
delegated
to
the
city.
the
legislature
laid
it
upon
the
record
and
said
only
certain
things
you
can
assess
far
in
then
name
them
like
street
improvements,
storm
sewers
and
so
forth.
and
they
setout
in
a
manner
in
which
it
shall
be
done
and
it
was
followed
specifically
and
let
me
show
you
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
no,
sir.
but
don't
you
understand
that
notice
there,
sir,
is
after
the
work
has
been
completed
and
they're
going
to
accept
it
from
the
contractors.
suppose
it
was
in
front
of
your
house,
but
you
didn't
think
the
contractor
had
properly
done
that
way
and
you're
going
pay,
you
can
go
down
there
and
call
attention
to
committee.
don't
pay
that
man
yet
because
he
hadn't
properly
performed
his
duty.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
the
only
notice,
the
other
side
attacked
in
this
case
was
the
first
notice
that
was
given.
one
note
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
they
do.
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
page
94?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
the
preliminary
assessment
roll.
that
--
that
preliminary
assessment
roll
was
not
--
is
open
to
the
public
then
for
inspection.
in
other
words,
they
have
made
a
preliminary
assessment
roll
to
tell
you
just
what
it
costs.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
that
was
published.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that
was
published
twice,
two
successive
weeks.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
when
a
roll
becomes
final,
you
get
a
tax
notice
delivered
to
you.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
the
last
notice
published.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
at
least
a
week
apart.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
they
don't
do
that.
it's
the
one
you're
mentioning
on
page
90.
now,
on
page
90,
sir,
is
after
the
contractor
and
if
you
see
notices
have
been
given
prior
to
that,
notices
are
given
before
anybody,
but
getting
back
to
page
90,
that's
given
because
the
contractor
has
reported
to
the
city
that
he
has
completed
the
way.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
1954.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
during
that
period,
you
see
the
--
the
taxes
--
this
is
on
june
the
3rd,
1953.
the
next
--
next
thing
there
is
july
1954.
that
that
budget
is
prepared
for
the
city
there
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
page
90
is
one
notice
which
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
he
asked
me
about
another
one
and
you
gave
the
date.
i
didn't
check
it,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
except
that
part
that
they
paid,
yes
sir.
yes,
they
paid
some.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
how
do
you
know
what
it
is?
well,
when
they
come
at
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
all
of
that's
on
file
in
the
clerk's
office
and
you
were
told
in
the
notice
that
a
preliminary
tax
roll
has
been
prepared.
then
you
were
told
of
the
meeting,
you
were
told
twice
that
you
can
go
to
the
meeting.
nobody
went
on
any
of
these
meetings
and
put
up
any
objection
and
the
first
notice
was
filed
on
december
2nd,
1950
--
march
the
4th,
1950
and
this
--
the
assessment
became
final
unless
--
little
less
than
60
days
of
december
2nd,
1953.
so
that's
more
than
three
years
or
less.
and
as
we
alleged
in
the
answers,
these
people,
sat
on
their
front
porch
and
entered
the
driveways
of
their
home
and
saw
this
weight
done
and
completed.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
they
didn't
file
the
challenge
to
--
they
filed
their
amended
complaint
on
december
the
2nd.
i
believed
they
filed
their
first
complaint
somewhere
in
march,
which
made
it
about
--
march
of
1953,
which
made
it
three
years.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
some
of
them
they
hadn't
collected
at
all.
some
of
them
had
paid
this
and
some
of
them
hadn't.
now,
he'd
brought
what's
known
here
as
a
class
action.
of
course,
in
our
answer,
we
said,
he
had
no
authority
to
represent
except
those
two
to
three
in
each
case
who
would
employ.
but
he
brought
a
class
action
saying
that
he
represented
all
of
those
classes
that
had
paid,
they
wanted
their
money
back
and
those
who
hadn't
paid
and
the
judge
in
his
final
decree,
which
i
want
to
mention
to
you,
doesn't
mention
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
in
that
decree,
he
appointed
a
special
master
and
the
master
then,
it
hasn't
gotten
that
far
because
the
supreme
court
of
florida
reversed
it.
that
special
master
would
have
found
what
an
attorney's
fee
should
be
paid
to
counsel
who
represented
the
class
from
each
and
every
one
of
those
people,
of
those
who
had
paid,
if
they
get
their
money
back
and
of
those
who
hadn't
paid,
they
would
have
to
pay.
in
other
words,
one
of
this
class
action
is
a
bonanza,
if
you
bring
in
the
sums,
in
other
words,
if
you're
not
going
to
assess
them.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
that's
it.
that's
it
for
the
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
one
of
the
things
you
see.
yes,
sir.
then
you
see
the
--
the
--
in
all
different
stages,
you
see
one
time,
you
see
plans
and
specifications.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
that
--
after
that
tax
roll,
that
preliminary
tax
roll,
then
here's
the
next
step.
they
still
have
another
opportunity
as
prescribed
by
law.
they
then
have,
after
this
lien
is
imposed,
after
the
tax
roll
is
--
becomes
final
and
the
assessment
becomes
final,
they
have
10
days
in
which
to
file
a
petition
in
the
circuit
court.
and,
it's
not
a
formal
affair.
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
file
a
petition.
they
can
do
that
on
their
benefits
and
it
goes
on
and
says
are
on
any
question
whatsoever,
they
can
file.
now,
they
didn't
do
that.
they
say
that
after
the
whole
thing
became
final,
which
was
three
years
later
after
one
of
them
started,
when
it
became
final,
they
waited
until
53
days
in
one
case,
i
believe,
in
40,
something
and
another.
and
they
didn't
go
down
and
followed
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
statute.
they
filed
a
class
suit
in
equity
to
declare
that
the
statute
did
not
follow
--
the
publication
did
not
follow
the
state
statute.
and
the
lower
court,
in
its
opinion,
has
this
to
say,
“if
that
again,
in
the
statement
to
you,
one
given
to
you
in
full.
it
was
stated
to
you
that
the
lower
court
found
the
notice,
the
only
notice
they
attack
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law."
that
isn't
what
he
said.
here
is
what
the
court
said
exactly.
this
is
the
final
decree.
the
court
said,
“the
notice
of
the
hearing
of
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i'm
reading
from
page
23
of
the
record.
this
is
paragraph
5,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
and
this
is
the
only
place
for
everyone.
he
had
mentioned
the
constitution
of
united
states,
one
time
in
here.
a
notice
of
the
hearing
of
objections
to
the
imposition
of
the
assessment
here
and
above
referred
to
was
insufficient
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
then
he
says
how?
in
that,
it
specified
no
place
where
the
objections
would
be
heard
and
there
was
no
designation
in
the
notice
of
what
city
commission
was
to
hear
objections.
no
designation
of
the
city
in
which
the
streets
were
located
or
of
what
the
city,
the
person
filing,
the
notice
was
claimed.
the
notice
was
also
insufficient
because
it
was
inserted
in
the
classified
section
of
the
miami
herald
and
in
such
a
manner
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
any
reasonable
person
was
put
upon
notice
by
it
and
that
--
that
their
property
was
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
special
assessment.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
what
i
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
under
our
law,
as
we'd
set
up
in
our
answer,
but
we
differ
with
what
he
says
that
we
just
don't
follow
this
and
with
it.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
we
contend
even
if
the
first
notice
was
bad.
he's
had
ample
--
every
one
of
these
people
has
had
ample
notice.
but
here's
what
we
say
he's
attempting
to
do
now.
just
like
he
hadn't
gotten
a
right
to
be
up
here
on
an
appeal
under
your
statute,
on
the
federal
statute,
because
if
he
could
be
here,
it
would
have
to
be
by
certiorari
under
title
28-12-57-2
by
appeal,
whereas,
drawn
in
question
the
validity
of
a
state
statute
of
any
state
on
the
ground
of
it's
being
repugnant
to
the
constitution,
free
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
decision
is
in
favor
of
its
validity.
now,
he
got
up
and
told
you
that
he
won
the
case
in
the
supreme
court
on
its
first
opinion
on
nonfederal
grounds.
now,
if
it
had
ended
there,
it
would
in
any
statute
declare
it
unconstitutional,
but
he
told
you
something
else.
he
says
he
didn't
have
any
right
to
bring
up
the
federal
constitution
because
the
city
lost
below.
he
did
have
a
right
to
bring
it
up,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
has
constantly
held,
anytime
a
lower
court
reaches
the
right
conclusion,
but
for
the
wrong
reason,
you
can
bring
up
the
right
reason
as
to
why
they
ought
to
be
in
--
affirmed
on
the
result.
but
as
a
practical
matter
and
i
think
everybody
that
practices
law
in
miami
knows
it,
what
he
is
attempting
to
say
now,
is
this.
and
the
cases
that
he
has
read
to
you
deal
with
the
process
in
judicial
proceedings
not
in
taxation
through
assessment.
every
case
that
he
has
read
you
and
in
my
brief
there
that
i
wrote
he
replied
with
one
and
he
said
my
statement
was
untrue
that
he
didn't
cite
in
the
cases
dealing
with
assessments.
and
he
came
back
and
stated
that
he
did
and
at
the
case
he
cited
was
new
york
versus
new
york
--
new
hampshire
&
hartford
railroad
company
344
u.s.
97
lawyer's
edition.
i
didn't
think
i
was
wrong
but
i
just
ought
to
study
this
case
to
see,
i
stated
in
my
brief
this
fact.
this
case
involved
the
lack
of
notice
to
a
creditor
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
creditor
was
not
notified
by
mail
but
by
publication
on
a
newspaper.
the
court
held
that
the
failure
to
file
a
creditor's
claim
was
excused
for
lack
of
proper
notice.
now,
in
the
case,
your
exact
words
on
that
was
this,
"the
judge
allot
--
the
district
judge
allowed
a
notice
by
publication.
and
this
court
said
had
the
judge
complied
with
the
statutes'
mandate.
it
is
likely
that
notice
would
have
been
mailed
to
new
york
city.
there
was
no
assessment
involved
in
this
case.
on
assessment
had
long
since
been
entered
and
a
lien
had
been
imposed
upon
its
property
of
the
railroad.
the
railroad,
of
course,
was
in
bankruptcy.
nobody
was
contesting
the
lien
what
the
railroad
did
take
the
position
here
that
the
city
of
new
york
having
failed
to
file
its
claim.
since
the
notice
was
published
that
they
were
barred,
but
i'll
tell
you
the
law
that
knocks
him
down
entirely.
this
court
has
already
decided
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
as
i
mentioned
i
want
to
finish
that,
they
--
they
decided
the
case
on
non-federal
grounds.
and
here
is
what
the
--
the
man
who
wrote
the
dissent
on
a
petition
for
rehearing
his
dissent
became
the
majority.
and
here's
what
he
said
in
connection
with
this
notice,
there
was
no
difference
among
these
judges
all
seven
of
them
on
the
notice.”
here's
what
--
what
is
said
by
him.
“this
is
the
--
the
final
opinion
that
became
final,
justice
drew
wrote.
and
he
said
this,
“holding
then,
as
we
unanimously
do,
that
the
notice
discussed
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
thomas
--
justice
thomas
was
in
all
respects
regular
and
in
full
compliance
with
the
provision
of
the
city
charter
relating
to
special
assessments
for
benefits."
now,
he
doesn't
mention
anywhere
the
constitution
of
united
states
because
these
people
pinpointed
in
their
complaint,
everything
they
raised
was
something
that
didn't
comply
with
the
statute
itself.
the
city
charter
being
a
statute
because
they
go
on
and
tell
you
to
place
and
knows
it
--
if
they
didn't
raise
any
federal
grounds
on
that,
although
one
place
in
his
complaint,
he
just
shoots
a
shotgun
blast
at
the
florida
constitution
and
the
--
and
the
united
states
constitution.
but
there,
he's
--
tells
you
again,
upon
the
following
grounds,
then
he
sets
out
those
little
things.
he
doesn't
tell
you
anywhere
to
be
up
here
under
appeal,
he
would
--
here's
what
he's
attempting
to
tell
you
now.
that
constructive
notice
in
tax
assessment
matters
would
be
the
same
as
in
judicial
proceedings
and
no
constructive
notice
would
be
good.
that
you
would
have
to
have
personal
notice
as
process
in
a
--
in
a
proceeding
that's
judicial,
that
is
the
position
he's
taking
here
and
he
took
it
for
his
first
time
in
his
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
supreme
court
struck
his
brief
and
nowhere
do
they
mention
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
it's
close
to
brickell,
you
know
--
yes,
sir,
south
miami
--
you
know
where
south
miami
avenue
goes
across.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
it
does
go
through
intersections,
but
the
city
paid
for
it
at
the
intersections.
the
city
itself
paid
for
those
rights.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
you
see
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
brickell
avenue
at
that
point
go
run
north
and
south.
mr.
milton
m.

no,

mr.

ferrell
page
what,
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
i
think
what
--
what
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i
--
i
want
to
say
a
word
too
about
his
argument.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
objection.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
but
what
he's
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
here's
what
i
say
to
that.
now,
where
are
you
reading
from,
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
all
right,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
here's
what
i
say
to
that
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
if
--
if
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
here's
what
happened.
they
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
they
published
a
notice.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
they
--
i
tell
you,
none
of
those
cases
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
left
off
yesterday
on
the
question
of
local
improvements,
while
the
legislature
of
a
state,
as
in
this
case,
enacted
a
statute
and
set
forth
exactly
what
assessments
could
be
made
and
how
the
--
how
the
notice
would
be
given
and
set
forth
very
strict
limitations
as
to
these
assessments.
now,
this
court
has
passed
on
that
very
question
in
the
case
of
browning
versus
hooper,
269
u.s.
396.
that
court
--
the
court
held
in
that
case
where
a
local
improvement
territory
is
selected
and
the
burden
is
spread
by
the
legislature
or
by
a
municipality
to
which
the
state
has
granted
full
legislative
powers
over
the
subject,
the
owners
of
the
property
in
the
district
have
no
constitutional
right
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
benefits.
now,
in
the
case
that
i
cited
to
you,
the
supreme
court
did
hold
that
statute
unconstitutional
because
they
held
the
district
in
that
case
was
not
created
by
the
legislature.
the
taxing
district
there
had
been
not
been
created
by
the
legislature,
but
the
next
case
on
it
is
the
case
of
memphis
&
c.r.
company
versus
pace.
in
this
case,
the
state
statute
creating
road
districts
and
permitting
the
levy
of
taxes
against
property
therein
was
attacked
under
the
due
process
cause
of
the
federal
constitution.
and
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
proper
attack
was
made
and
it
was
made
on
that
point
which,
of
course,
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
but
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
it
would
have
to
be
uniform,
but
naturally,
in
a
city,
some
streets
might
need
repair
at
times
when
others
wouldn't.
but
in
due
time,
probably
all
of
them
will
be
done
but
this
case
holds
this.
you
have
--
the
legislature
of
florida
could
have
written
a
statute
where
no
notice
would
have
been
given
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
any
federal
question
involved
because
that's
what
this
court
holds.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
but
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right,
sir.
that's
what
this
court
held.
this
court
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
this
court
said
this
in
--
in
regard
to
that.
this
court
held
that
the
district
was
created
by
the
legislature,
that
this
was
a
question
in
law
--
of
law
and
that
the
decision
of
the
state
on
this
question
was
controlling.
this
court
held
therein
that
property
owners
in
districts
created
under
the
authority
of
the
legislature
and
being
legislatively
created
districts
were
not
entitled
to
notice
and
hearing
as
to
the
benefits
conferred.
they
held
and
went
on
and
said
that
it's
a
matter
that
rest
in
the
discretion
of
the
state
and
are
not
controlled
by
either
the
due
process
or
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
validity
of
that
statute
was
upheld
by
this
court.
and
i
say
to
you
in
this
court,
if
you
had
the
proper
attack
in
this
case,
which
you
don't,
and
i'll
mention
that
again
in
a
second.
if
he
had
properly
attacked,
he
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't,
under
the
rulings
of
this
court,
be
entitled
to
any
relief
because
our
statute
in
florida
goes
further
than
your
requirements
because
this
very
statute
could
have
provided
for
no
notice
whatsoever.
now,
counsel,
in
his
brief,
my
opponent,
he
tries
to
cite
some
state
cases.
he
cites
a
new
jersey
case.
he
doesn't
cite
any
federal
question
--
cases
on
this
question
but
he
attempts
to
tell
you
that
in
cases
where
the
legislature
delegates
the
authority.
we
don't
have
that
in
the
florida
act
because
the
florida
act
sets
forth
what
the
city
can
do.
they
don't
give
them
any
right
to
make
any
rules
and
regulations
as
to
publication,
as
to
what
can
be
done.
they
can
only
levy
these
assessments
on
the
storm
sewers,
improvements
to
streets.
they
don't
have
any
power
to
do
anything
except
what
that
legislative
act
is.
they
haven't
delegated
anything.
they
have
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
the
--
the
act,
in
no
case,
in
no
state
does
a
legislature
sit
as
a
legislature
and
determine
whether
there
are
any
benefits
under
these
things.
that
would
be
impractical
and
you
won't
find
any
case
where
it's
done.
they
have
just
said,
where
storm
sewers,
unless
three-day
improvements
are
made,
that
is
a
benefit.
they
have
legislative
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
they
can't
do
that.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
it's
a
benefit.
now,
they
have
their
rights
in
the
state
court
as
to
that.
you
have
seen
how
many
notice
is
here,
and
no
--
and
one
of
this
case
is
over
a
period
of
three
years.
then,
after
all
that
is
done,
they
have
a
limited
time
to
go
into
the
circuit
court
on
a
very
informal
petition.
and
in
this
case,
they
failed
to
avail
themselves
of
that
right.
that
in
itself,
this
statute
limits
the
time
in
which
action
can
be
brought
on
these
things.
it
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
they
have
had
a
notice
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
--
by
publication.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
if
they
don't
get
a
personal
notice,
well,
they
don't
have
--
they
haven't
been
personally
notified,
but
what
i'm
saying
now,
in
every
one
of
these
cases
cited
by
the
other
side
in
here,
they
have
no
application
to
a
proposition
like
this.
why,
you
have
written
an
opinion.
in
every
one
of
these
cases
he
cited
to
you,
you
will
find
in
each
one
of
them
is
a
question
in
a
judicial
proceeding
where
couldn't
have
said
this
by
publication.
the
first
case
he
cited
was
this
mullane
versus
central
bank
--
hanover
bank
&
trust
company,
339
u.s.
306.
that
case
involved
the
validity
of
a
new
york
statute
concerning
trust
companies
which
permitted
the
trustee
to
have
a
judicial
settlement
of
its
accounts
by
publication
in
a
newspaper.
you,
of
course,
held
that
unconstitutional.
the
second
case
he
cites
and
tells
you,
as
a
per
curiam
discussed
yesterday,
new
york
versus
new
york,
new
hampshire
&
hartford
railroad
company,
344
u.s.
293.
that
was
a
case
where
it
was
a
bankruptcy
question.
the
creditor
was
notified
by
mail
but
by
publication
in
the
newspaper.
the
creditor
was
the
city
of
new
york.
there
was
no
question
about
the
assessment.
the
lean
had
been
made
and
had
been
on
there
for
some
time.
they
had
never
questioned
the
assessment.
it
was
a
question
of
the
claim
being
barred
because
they
didn't
file
a
claim.
they
contended
that
was
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
i
read
you
yesterday
what
this
court
said
that
the
district
judge
didn't
follow
the
statute
--
the
bankruptcy
statute
on
that
in
requiring
the
proper
notice.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
assessments,
other
than
the
claim
that
was
barred
just
happen
to
be
one
for
an
assessment.
it
would
have
applied
had
it
been
anything.
now,
the
only
difference
in
the
court
on
that
case
was
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
question.
i
think
two
justices
said
the
fact
that
the
city
had
a
lean
on
a
railroad
--
specific
railroad
property,
as
in
this
case,
is
on
specific
property
where
the
improvements
were
made,
that
they
wouldn't
be
barred
under
the
bankruptcy
act
anyway
because
they
still
had
their
liens
on
that
specified
property.
the
next
case
he
cited
was
covey
versus
town
of
somers,
351
u.s.
141.
this
case
involved
a
foreclosure
against
an
incompetent
and
whether
or
not
he
was
properly
certed.
in
this
case,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
certified
that
due
process
was
raised
and
denied
by
it.
the
next
case
he
mentioned
yesterday
was
the
walker
versus
the
city
of
hutchinson,
352
u.s.
112.
that
case
involved
a
condemnation
proceeding
in
which
process
was
obtained
by
publication
in
a
newspaper.
he
cites
the
case
of
lambert
versus
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
--
the
people
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
that
was
a
judicial
proceeding,
sir,
and
i
say
this.
this
question
wasn't
raised
in
the
lower
court
and
the
appellant
court,
but
if
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
--
if
it
was
the
law
that
in
any
tax
assessment
benefit
here,
that
notice
by
publication
was
insufficient
and
it
took
personal
notice,
of
course,
we
didn't
have
anything
but
notice
by
publication,
and
naturally,
if
you
required
more
notice
than
notice
by
publication,
the
city
could
not
prevail.
of
course
that
question
wasn't
raised,
but
if
it
were
raised
in
a
case,
and
that's
the
way
this
is
done
all
over
the
united
states
in
most
cities
and
countries
is
--
counties
is
just
like
this,
by
publication.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i'll
go
behind
the
record.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i
have
--
i
have
talked
to
and
corresponded
with
a
number
of
city
attorneys
and
saw
one
yesterday
from
texas
who
was
right
here
who
came
up
to
me
and
told
me,
“your
statute
is
exactly
like
iowa's,”
and
he
was
the
city
of
--
attorney
of
laredo,
i
believe,
mr.
hill.
he
was
present
here
yesterday.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
not
a
detailed
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
i've
never
made
a
detailed
study
of
that.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
all
of
this
--
this
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
i
couldn't
give
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i
think
it
would
probably
--
all
of
these
things
would
be
more
than
500.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
these
assessments
are
not
levied
to
patch
up
streets.
it's
usually
for
an
improvement
that
extends
to
considerable
distance
and
it
would
cover
everybody
in
that
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
area.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
it
would
be
alike
on
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
that
and
it
wouldn't
be
in
accordance
with
your
property.
suppose
the
man
next
door
to
you
had
four
times
the
lot
you
did,
he'd
pay
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
if
you
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
if
you
--
if
you
meant
by
that,
sir,
that
the
notice
by
publication,
if
you
took
for
granted
that
nobody
saw
it,
that
the
people
who
lived
there
assumed
that
those
improvements
which
they
saw
going
in
and
they
had
the
benefit
of
and
this
time
element
shows
you
that
their
last
opportunity
to
be
heard
was
after
that
work
had
been
completed
and
the
city
had
paid
for
it
with
their
money
and
hadn't
gotten
any
back
from
this
property
owners,
then
if
notice
by
publication
in
that
--
the
vision
of
it
insufficient,
then
they
had
no
notice.
and
the
only
way
we
could
give
them
notice
then,
if
it
got
down
to
it,
is
have
the
sheriff
serve
each
and
every
one
of
them.
and
when
we
finish
checking
the
title
of
this
property
as
to
who
owned
it
all
the
way
through
that
period
of
time
as
it
would
change,
and
you
would
have
a
new
group
entitled
to
notice
each
time
if
it
changed,
then
it
would
cost
those
taxpayers
a
great
deal
of
more
money.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
they
would
have
to
pay
it.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
it
was
under
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
it
was
under
the
legal
notices
but
i
don't
believe
they
would
sell
us
that
unless
we
did
it
in
a
form
of
an
advertisement.
it
would
be
costly.
i
--
but
if
notice
by
publication
isn't
good,
it
wouldn't
be
good
on
the
front
page.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
i
believe,
so,
sir,
that
--
i
believe
this
act
we
told
you
was
enacted
in
--
this
amendment
was
in
25
to
this
charter,
but
if
that
alone,
if
it
had
been
no
notices,
the
act
provided
for
no
notice
whatsoever,
still,
under
these
cases
where
the
legislature
has
done
it,
it
wouldn't
be
a
federal
question.
but
we
don't
have
it
here.
i
don't
think
that
that
alone
would
be
sufficient
for
that
request.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
the
thing
that
i
was
citing
to
you
were
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
which
this
court
said
that
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
was
concerned,
the
property
owner
was
not
entitled
to
be
heard
on
benefits.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
what
you
held.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
you've
held
that
in
the
case
of
memphis
&
c.r.
company
versus
pace.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
the
next
case
on
it
is
browning
versus
hooper,
269
u.s.
396.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
these
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
what
i
say
is
this.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
this
is
not
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
they
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir,
but
they
may
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
and
they
have
had
said
this,
sir,
about
those
districts.
being
legislatively
created
districts,
they
said
they
were
not
entitled
to
notice
and
hearing
as
to
the
benefits
conferred.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
all
right.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
so,
let
me
answer
that,
sir.
he
told
you
yesterday
that
there
was
--
that
he
took
a
deposition
and
that
he
got
leave
of
the
lower
court
to
do
that.
he
didn't
tell
you
that
he
got
that
leave
of
the
lower
court
some
time
after
the
lower
court
opinion
was
handed
down
the
decree
in
february
of
1955.
now,
he
doesn't
give
you
the
date
on
his
motion
for
leave
to
supplement
the
record
that
he
read
to
you
yesterday
here,
but
he
goes
into
a
letter
that
he
got
on
the
deposition
which
is
june
1st,
1956.
now,
he
doesn't
show
you
the
dates
on
here
when
he
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
a
motion
for
leave
to
supplement
record
on
appeal
to
show
some
discriminatory
action.
he
filed
it,
and
again,
he
didn't
put
the
order
in
here
but
it
shows
in
his
petition
for
rehearing
that
supreme
court
of
florida
denied
that
motion
for
leave
to
supplement
record
on
appeal.
and
never
having
been
in
the
lower
court
as
a
record,
it
wouldn't
allow
it
in
the
supreme
court
but
it
was
physically
up
there
in
the
file
and
he
printed
it
in
this
record,
and
it's
not
in
the
records
of
this
court.
it's
not
considered
and
put
it
in
here
and
came
up
here
yesterday
and
argued
that
to
you.
that
wasn't
raised
and
i
want
to
mention
this
to
the
court
while
i'm
on
that
subject.
our
file
is
directed
by
the
court
this
morning,
as
you
directed
me
yesterday,
a
copy
of
the
city's
motion
which
resulted
in
the
striking
of
their
--
the
brief
of
the
appellants
here
on
their
rehearing
where
they
raised,
for
the
first
time,
the
constitutional
question.
and
counsel
answered
justice
harlan
yesterday
when
you
asked
him
that
question,
if
they
didn't
strike
it
because
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time.
here's
all
the
city
said
in
their
short
motion,
they
said
here
once,
number
two,
“the
suggestion
--
suggestions
of
appellees
in
their
petition
for
rehearing
and
application
to
file
brief
confined
solely
to
the
federal
constitutional
question
sought
to
be
raised
by
appellees
was
not
raised
by
the
appellees
in
the
trial
court
and
now
appears
before
this
court
for
the
first
time.”
we
then
have
said,
“appellants
respectfully
submit
that
to
permit
the
suggestion
of
a
constitutional
question
objection
not
raised
in
the
trial
court
nor
included
in
the
main
briefs
before
this
court
is
contrary
to
the
long
lines
of
decisions
enunciated
by
this
court.”
we
cited
on
a
case
there
and
i
want
to
make
one
more
comment
on
--
counsel
read
to
you
yesterday,
in
his
opening
argument,
a
little
conclusion
from
his
brief
where
he
said
in
his
main
brief
before
the
rehearing
question
came
up
that
he
did
mention
the
constitutional
question.
he
read
you
a
sentence.
in
this
very
motion
that
the
city
filed
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
which
was
granted,
we
--
it
says
here,
and
here's
what
the
court
said
citing
the
case
of
randall
versus
miami
coin
club
in
88
so.2d
293.
it
says,
“only
at
the
conclusion
of
the
briefs
is
it
suggested
that
the
statute
may
be
subject
to
a
constitutional
objection,”
but
this
suggestion
is
neither
properly
briefed
nor
argued.
consequently,
it
cannot
be
said
to
be
raised
--
be
raised
on
this
appeal.
but
i'm
willing,
if
counsel
says
his
brief
in
the
main
cause
touched
upon
these
questions,
i'm
willing
for
him
to
file
it
before
you
and
let
you
see
how
much
of
it
he
raised.
i
have
no
objection
to
him
putting
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
in
our
answer,
and
all
the
way
through,
sir,
we
showed
--
we
set
out
all
of
these
notices
and
he
didn't
attack
any
notice
all
the
way
through
this
case.
you
can
look
at
his
brief,
other
than
by
attempting
in
his
petition
for
rehearing,
what
he
got
down
to
there
was
to
try
to
properly
raise
this
question
by
holding
that
any
notices
by
publication
would
be
insufficient,
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
actual
notice
more
than
by
publication,
not
constructive
notice.
that's
the
question
he
attempts
to
raise
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
that's
in
the
record,
struck
his
brief
as
to
the
constitutional
questions.
now,
he
says
to
you,
well,
they
considered
his
petition
for
rehearing.
they
considered
it
because
he
had
other
grounds
in
it
other
than
those
constitutional
questions,
but
my
time
is
running
out.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
what
they
did,
sir
--
yes,
sir.
it
wasn't
on
this
same
street
but
what
they
did
in
another
district,
the
city,
each
time
they
--
they
--
the
place
is
a
district,
what
they
did,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
pulled
up
the
assessment
on
this.
and
i
might
say,
in
connection
with
that,
if
you'll
look,
there
has
been
a
flood
of
litigation
on
this
question.
there
are
many,
many
cases
that
have
been
pending
and
disposed
of
here
recently,
in
the
last
six
months,
on
this
very
assessment
problem.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
and
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
of
course,
i
met
counsel
here
in
each
one
of
them.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
we
haven't
abandoned.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
what
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
i
dint
think
it
was
that
they
failed,
but
they
did
stop
the
assessment
advertisement
on
some
of
them,
on
one
of
them
that
i
know
of,
definitely,
here
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
--
as
he
has
got
in
his
record.
sir?
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
they
had
started,
in
this
case,
i
believe
on
the
notices.
let's
see,
and
they
had
gotten
down
to
the
question
of
hearing
objections
to
the
completed
way
to
what
appears
here,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
so,
the
work
had,
evidently,
been
completed
and
the
notice
then
as
to
that
was
--
that
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
--
is
when
they
held
up.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
that's
right.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well,
here,
i
think,
in
this
case,
i
can
read
you
from
this
letter
that
is
in
here
will
probably
be
the
--
it
says,
mr.
anderson
writes
this
letter,
“my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
fact
that
the
city
commission,
at
about
the
time
this
district
was
ordered,”
and
this
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
disallowed
in
the
record,
whether
it
will
answer
your
question
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
not
this
case
that
he's
--
mr.
anderson
has
written
a
letter
here
that
--
to
the
engine
--
department
of
engineering
which
will
answer
your
question
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
--
but
which
the
supreme
court
did
not
allow
in
the
record.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i
think
here
is
the
difference.
it
says
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
it's
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
he
has
put
it
in
the
record
because
he
physically
sent
the
papers
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
tried
to
supplement
the
record,
and
they
wouldn't
--
they
denied
his
motion
and
wouldn't
let
it
come
in
because
he
tried
to
put
it
in
after
the
petition
for
rehearing
had
been
granted.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
he
had
not
raised
that
point
before.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir,
it's
not.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
he
has
put
it
in
this
record.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
he
has
put
it
before
you
in
here
and
he
has
not
put
in
the
order
in
this
record
showing
you
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
denied
that
that
i
see.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
in
other
words,
i
think
you
would
get
the
--
the
--
in
other
words,
what
he
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
have
you
consider
something
here
that
was
not
before
the
trial
court.
it
wasn't
even
in
existence
until,
that
letter
there,
until
after
the
decree,
and
then
he
brought
it
up
after
his
petition
for
--
the
petition
of
the
city
for
rehearing
was
granted
and
tried
to
come
in
with
that.
now,
they
wouldn't
let
him
do
it.
they
denied
his
motion
to
supplement
the
record
but
he
has
brought
it
here
to
you
now,
not
having
been
in
the
record
and
asked
you
to
consider
it.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir.
here
is
what
it
is,
you
see
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
well
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
the
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
the
endeavor
is
to
show
you
that
there
has
been
an
area
in
the
city
where
they
didn't
do
it
and
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i
will
tell
you
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
it
might
be.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir,
that
isn't,
just
like
if
you
investigated
the
city,
i
imagine
you
will
find
a
lot
of
things
down
there
that
not
--
is
not
equal
protection
under
the
law,
most
any
of
them.
but
i
can't
try
a
lawsuit
for
him
on
a
question
that
he
raises
and
get
up
here
and
have
him
dig
up
that's
never
been
in
the
record,
everything
they
are
doing
down
there
that's
unequal
or
unfair.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
here
is
what
happened
there,
sir.
you
see,
the
city
--
or
the
supreme
court
granted
a
rehearing
and
allowed
further
argument.
now,
at
that
argument,
counsel
for
the
appellants
here,
the
property
owners,
he
requested
the
supreme
court
at
that
time
to
allow
him
to
file
a
brief.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
and
they
didn't
do
it.
now,
he
came
back
again
--
i
don't
--
to
be
frank
with
you,
when
he
asked
him
to
let
him
file
a
brief
at
that
time,
i
don't
know
whether
he
said
on
the
--
limited
it
just
to
the
constitutional
right.
then,
he
got
back
and
he
filed
a
--
he
filed
a
motion
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
a
written
motion
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
--
asking
him
to
limit
it
to
that,
and
they
granted
it.
then,
when
he
file
his
--
we
filed
this
to
stop
him,
but
when
they
got
his
brief,
we
asked
to
vacate
the
order,
of
course
they
had
the
brief
in
their
possession.
they,
evidently,
looked
at
it
and
they
struck
it,
but
instead
of
vacating
the
order,
the
only
way
they
could
give
us
any
relief
after
it
go
there
was
to
strike
it.
but
in
that
brief,
you
will
see
the
difference
between
that
one
and
the
main
brief
he
filed
in
the
cause
because
even
the
opinion
that
he
depended
on,
the
dissenters'
which
is,
at
first,
was
the
majority,
he
sets
forth
very
well
that
proposition.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
no,
sir,
they
are
not.
but
i
--
as
i
told
you,
i
would
be
willing
for
counsel
there
to
--
to
file
here,
to
let
you
see
what
he
did
raise
and
i
said
it
yesterday.
anytime
in
a
lower
court,
if
a
court
decides
for
me
in
the
lower
court
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
all
right,
sir.
i
will
be
glad
to
--
to
get
them
to
you,
sir.
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
i
would
like
to
read
you
just
a
paragraph
here
as
to
what
the
dissenting
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
dissent
which
was
at
one
time,
the
majority
before
the
rehearing
was
granted
and
it
was
reversed,
what
he
says.
it
was
no
difference
in
all
seven
of
the
members
of
the
supreme
court
on
the
notice,
they
all
held
the
notice
was
sufficient
under
the
law.
but
the
only
thing
they
had
a
difference
on
was
whether
resurfacing
and
repaving
were
synonymous,
and
this
question
of
whether
they
were
estopped.
the
dissenters
held
that
under
the
state
statute,
not
--
not
any
--
under
the
state
statute,
repaving
wouldn't
be
allowed
under
that
statute.
now,
here
the
--
the
man
who
wrote
the
opinion
that
they
depended
on
said
this,
and
he
is
the
one
that
went
for
him
with
the
other
two.
the
appellees
seem
to
have
convinced
the
circuit
court
that
there
were
five
defects
rendering
the
notice
insufficient
and
he
names
them,
which
every
one
of
them
a
state
grant.
then,
he
says
this.
“it
seems
to
us
that
an
interpretation
that
a
property
owner
who
wished
to
object
to
the
proceeding
would
not
be
sufficiently
informed
to
be
able
to
locate
a
meeting
of
the
commission
of
the
city
of
miami
would
be
farfetched.”
then,
it
goes
on
as
to
the
others
and
said,
“our
reaction
to
the
next
two
so-called
imperfections,
lack
of
identity
of
the
city
in
the
sign
of
the
notice
is
the
same
for
the
same
reasons.”
then,
he
goes
on
and
said,
“as
far
as
the
position
in
the
papers
--
mr.
milton
m.
ferrell
thank
you,
sir.
