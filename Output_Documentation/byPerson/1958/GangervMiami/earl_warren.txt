mr.
anderson
--
chief
justice

warren
--
under
the
charter,
does
that
--
is
that
initial
resolution
required
to
show
the
time
and
place
at
which
they
must
object?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
want
to
go
to
that
first
part.
it
does
require
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
is
the
--
they
give
--
they
give
them
notice
of
the
time
and
place
at
which
it
must
be
heard.
all
right,
now,
you
can
tell
me
about
the
resolution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
that
the
first
resolution?
i
--
that
is
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
the
--
the
first
one
specified
a
particular
meeting,
did
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
asked
you,
if
(voice

--
chief
justice

warren
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
charter
requires
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
you
may
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understand
you
that
the
second
notice
has
the
same
infirmities
as
the
first?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nadeau.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ferrell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
--
we'll
go
to
that
tomorrow
morning,
mr.
ferrell.
but,
would
you
file
with
the
court
please
a
copy
of
the
city's
motion
to
strike
the
brief
of
--
of
the
taxpayer
because
of
the
failure
to
raise
a
federal
petition.

mr.
ferrell,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ferrell,
at
the
--
just
as
you
--
as
we
adjourned
yesterday
afternoon,
you
were
about
to
come
to
that
last
argument
that
was
made
by
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
that
that
bares
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
particular
thing
because,
as
i
understood
it,
you
said
you
had
some
similar
proceedings
as
to
some
property
farther
down
the
street
where
they
did
not
assess
it
against
the
--
against
the
owners
of
the
property
but
that
in
this
particular
instance,
they
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ferrell,
i'd
still
like
to
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
that
last
point
that
he
made
in
his
argument
yesterday.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
if
it
is
a
fact
that
on
other
proceedings
on
this
same
street,
as
i
believe
he
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
they
were
--
proceedings
were
started
the
same
as
they
are
here,
that
they
did
not
assess
the
property
owners
but
--
on
his
property
and
in
this
particular
neighborhood,
they
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
some
of
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
on
some
of
those,
the
city
has
abandoned
its
claim
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
have
you
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
a
fact
in
that
though,
that
you
did
not
assess
them
as
you
did
in
this
particular
area
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
the
proceedings
were
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
do
the
work?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
do
work
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
just
stopped
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proceeding
there
and
did
not
assess
those
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
assessed
these
people.
now,
why
was
that
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
referring
to
this
particular
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
that
says
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think,
mr.
ferrell,
we'll
have
to
read
that
ourselves.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
anderson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
opinion
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
your
time
is
up,
mr.
--
