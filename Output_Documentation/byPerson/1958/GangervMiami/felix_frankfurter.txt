justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
of
the
notice
is
published
twice.
they
make
a
different
--
present
a
different
legal
problem,
if
the
notice
was
published
only
once.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
refresh
my
recollection,
the
walker
case
where
there's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
two
publications?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
deny
you
--
are
you
laying
it
down
as
a
matter
of
laws,
that
because
the
notice
once
would
be
inadequate,
the
same
notice
quite,
would
also
be
inadequate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
maybe
so,
but
must
have
been
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
in
the
main
case
of
a
very
different
one,
if
it's
published
only
once,
it
was
so
much
easier
to
turn
out
to
the
people
whose
names
--
who
gave
their
names.
as
all
the
difference
to
work
immediately
as
in
--
do
not
be
surprised
to
hear
between
notice
of
assessment
for
city
taxes
or
levy
and
the
kind
of
papers
were
involved
in
the
mullane.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
may
or
may
have
a
different
situation
on
the
fact
with
something
that's
public.
a
group
assessment's
done
as
compared
with
public
incomes
and
only
one
leadingly
in
a
single
newspaper.
and
it
may
well
be
that
that
makes
a
principle
that's
predicated
(inaudible)
that
you
say
that
two
is
just
as
valid
as
one,
in
all
event,
the
courts
below
didn't
face
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
that
prove
that
you
raised
the
invalidity
of
the
second
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
includes
it
a
revision
on
the
basis
of
two
notices?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
you're
challenging
that
here,
although
you
didn't
challenge
this
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
change
his
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
second
notice
concerned
to
the
public
twice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it
published?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
it
published?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that,
does
it
cover
the
territories
or
the
decline
of
property
owners?
i
would
know
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
the
record,
what's
published?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
--
but
the
whole
chain
of
procedure
by
which
improvement
is
made,
where
it's
made,
when
it's
made,
how
it's
made,
what
opportunities
you
have
to
attack
the
cost
of
the
improvement
out
of
which
coming
from
--
may
come
your
eloquent
share
of
responsibility.
you
said
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
all
part
of
the
whole
process
of
how
the
city
does
these
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
may
i
ask
you
some
more?
like
i
want
to
back
to
the
notice
on
page
90,
that
meeting
on
june
3rd,
your
objections
will
be
heard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
begin
in
one
kind
of
objection
namely
that
--
that
the
front
of
my
house,
paving
was
badly
done
or
it
wasn't
finished,
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
hearing,
presumably,
a
fact
in
such
a
hearing,
it
emphasized
what
the
cost
of
the
improvement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
happens
between
the
hearing
on
june
30,
what
has
--
what
is
done
inside
of
the
city
government
between
june
30th,
1953
and
the
preliminary
assessment
rolls,
remember
that
day
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
that's
caused
the
hearing
on
february
3rd.
now,
what
is
before
--
going
to
be
and
would
it
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
june
--
february
1954.
are
you
ready
to
decide
how
much
the
city
has
to
pay
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
what
they
pay
if
they
got,
it
goes
to
move
from
the
property
owner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap),
now,
in
the
--
in
the
period
between
june
3rd
and
the
next
opportunity
for
these
to
be
heard,
the
property
owners,
on
february
3rd,
1954.
during
that
period,
do
the
city
officials
decide
my
share
of
the
assessment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
they
say
that
--
but
how
do
i
know
what
my
assessment
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
know
from
this
notice.
if
i
go
there
on
february
3rd
will
i
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
ask
you
first?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
as
i
understand
the
complaint,
would
you
--
infringed
upon
here,
the
complaint
is
as
to
the
resolution,
22-277
in
the
record
which
i
--
whereby
this
pertaining
on
the
--
on
these
streets
was
to
be
carried
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
complaint
is
that
that
resolution
was
--
they
started
the
initiation
of
that
resolution
but
noted
--
notice
or
document
for
improvement,
the
document
--
oh,
the
resolution
of
the
document
(inaudible)
277
on
march
3rd.
and
notice
was
given
that
anybody
granting
the
complaint
about
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
on
the
15th
of
march.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
complaint
is
on
page
7c
--
12c.
the
notice
--
this
notice
saying
there
will
be
an
improvement
which
is
the
starting
point
of
it
all.
if
this
movement
is
voted,
it
was
suggesting
that
the
property
owner
would
know
because
if
anything,
drive
in
and
he
knows
what
work
was
being
done.
the
complaint
is
he
didn't
know
that
the
authorization
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
proper
one
because
he
didn't
have
a
chance
to
make
his
case
because
--
and
it
wasn't
proper
--
because
it
wasn't
duly
--
he
wasn't
duly
notified.
and
after
that
he
says
that
in
violation
of
the
term,
"constitution".
now,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
reading
from
a
start
of
the
notice
of
improvement
on
page
3
and
4
and
then
its
complaint
page
--
paragraph
12
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
page
6.
justice
felix
frankfurter
special
assessment
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
illegal
and
void
and
(inaudible)
property
violates
the
constitution.
and
the
reason
that's
illegal
and
void
is
because
he
didn't
have
notice
that
there
would
be
such
a
resolution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
in
effect,
the
city
of
miami,
ordered
an
improvement
in
front
of
his
property
without
this
opportunity
--
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
say
that's
an
improper
improvement
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
says
that's
(inaudible)
he
says
walker
and
hudson
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
dispose
of
the
relevance
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
that
dispose
of
the
relevance
of
the
case,
because
of
the
condemnation
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
your
authority
for
saying
that?
how
--
how
could
you
--
where
could
i
find
in
print,
any
kind
of
print
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
association
of
the
city
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
haven't
made
a
study,
have
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
in
your
brief
the
study
of
this
mode
of
assessment
before
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
and
since
the
common
practice
throughout
the
country
in
the
kind
of
notice
that's
given
in
levying
special
assessments?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
taxpayers
were
involved
in
this?
how
many
--
against
somehow
--
against
how
many
tax
payers
was
this
levy
in
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
numbers.
in
numbers,
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
50
or
500?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
make
a
difference
because
this
court
has
held
it's
one
thing
to
levy
against
--
for
special
benefit
against
individuals
as
to
whom
each
--
as
to
whom
as
--
a
case
must
be
made
out
in
each
instance
and
levying,
for
instance,
against
the
whole
county,
however
unfairly
they
have
been
levied
by
the
state.
this
court
has
made
that
distinction,
that
if
there's
a
mass,
you
couldn't
expect
to
give
individual
notice.
if
it's
just
a
few,
you
have
a
right
to
demand
individual
notice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alike
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alike
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
be
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
john
smith
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
be
benefited
but
william
jones
wouldn't
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
you
had
opportunity
to
be
heard.
because
i
understand
that
the
whole
--
the
crux
of
the
issue
here
is,
putting
aside
the
question
whether
the
question
was
properly
raised,
is
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
be
heard.
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
core
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
petitioner's
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
put
it
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
it
on
the
front
page
with
stream
of
headline
instead
of
on
the
second
page.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
constitutional
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
that
--
this
letter
of
mr.
anderson
that
you
are
about
to
quote
or
about
what
you're
talking,
was
that
with
reference
to
property
on
the
same
streets
as
the
case
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly,
is
this
a
matter
that's
in
the
record
or
is
this
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
outside
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
is
this
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
before
us
properly?
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
physically
printed
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
this
volume?
is
it
before
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
sense
that
it
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
--
am
i
right
in
inferring
that
the
point
of
--
the
point
sought
to
be
made
by
bringing
in,
allegedly,
non-assessment
of
like
property
in
the
same
region,
or
on
the
same
street
even,
that
this
legal
point
is
the
discriminatory
treatment
of
the
property
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
now
under
question?
isn't
that
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
the
point
before
us,
but
isn't
that
the
endeavor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
behind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
raising
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
might
be
discrimination
and
might
be
on
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
properly
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
legislature
of
florida
decides
that
it's
necessary
to
make,
add,
or
to
have
a
new
facing
of
all
the
streets
in
miami.
could
the
legislature
do
that
without
giving
anybody
any
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
court
--
is
there
any
case
decided
by
this
court
in
which
it
was
held,
when
a
state
legislature
gives
a
whole
new
charter
to
a
city,
whether
its
cleveland
or
minneapolis
or
miami
or
new
york
gives
a
whole
new
charter
to
a
city,
gives
full
power
to
the
city
to
determine
what
kind
of
streets
it
should
have?
well,
that
if
legislature
could,
itself,
do,
it
couldn't
do
by
way
of
a
whole
new
charter.
do
i
understand
that
to
be
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
understanding
that
a
city
couldn't
be
authorized
to
have
unreviewable
power
by
the
state
legislature
to
do
what
they
could
do
at
all
for
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
can
say
is
if
that's
the
law,
then
i'm
greatly
surprised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
am
surprised
if
your
--
your
statement
of
the
law
is
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
legislature
can
tell
the
city
of
new
york
it
shouldn't
run
up
to
albany
to
find
out
whether
there
should
be
pacing
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
bet
you
think
that
albany
may
do
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
the
legislature
may
do
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
does
not
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
repaving
done
throughout
the
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
resurfacing,
was
that
done
throughout
the
city
of
miami?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
done
in
the
restricted
territory,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
done
in
the
restricted
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
does
that
mean,
what
you've
just
read
that
it
was
general
benefit,
not
special?
justice
felix
frankfurter
saying
that
everybody
in
the
united
states
and
most
of
those
read
benefits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
think
that
this
court
should
sit
in
judgment
as
to
whether
--
who
was
that
judge
who
went
over
the
other
side,
chief
justice
terrell
or
thomas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thornal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
we
say
he
was
right
the
first
time
but
wrong
the
second?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
couldn't
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
courts
can't
change
their
minds
on
questions
of
fact.
they
constantly
overrule
the
law
of
florida
on
determinations
of
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
should
we
go
on
and
should
we
consider
that
question
on
the
merits
or
be
bound
by
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
you
could
bring
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
bring
it
here.
you're
on
rehearing.
you
raise
the
question
and
your
supreme
court
refused
to
consider
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
anderson,
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious
in
the
slightest,
remotely,
in
asking
you
whether,
if
the
notice
had
been
on
the
front
page,
you
would
make
the
same
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there
is
no
difference
between
notice
to
a
fellow
whether
they've
got
some
money
in
the
bank
or
whether
he
doesn't
file
notice
or
a
stockholder
and
the
kind
of
publicity
that
is
necessarily
engendered
by
a
piece
of
public
work
done
in
an
--
in
the
line
of
wade
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
houses
were
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
have
raised
that
question
in
your
circuit
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
your
--
is
your
answer
to
that
answer
is
your
--
do
you
deal
with
that
by
the
contention
that
requiring
you
to
do
so
within
10
days
violates
due
process
because
it
doesn't
give
you
time
enough,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
one
of
your
questions.
it's
essential
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
you
--
i
didn't
remotely
said
you
did
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
if
a
state
statute
says
that
you
must
raise
these
questions
of
non-benefit
within
10
days
and
you
didn't
do
it,
you
could
object
to
what
has
happened
to
you
only
if
there
were
some
constitutional
vice
in
the
limitation
of
the
10
days.
is
that
what
you
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
could
have
raised
that
question,
you
said,
in
the
circuit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
the
notice
question
aside
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
a
moment.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
in
the
circuit
court,
you
could
review
and
raise
every
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
the
validity
of
the
administrative
assessment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
order
--
putting
the
notice
question
aside
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
must
attack
that
requirement
of
your
state
to
raise
it
that
way
on
the
ground
that
that
in
itself
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is,
10
days
is
too
short.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
assuming
accustomed
to
dilatoriness
in
the
merit
of
litigation
but
we
think
10
days
is
nothing.
