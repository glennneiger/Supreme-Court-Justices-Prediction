mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there,
on
two
consolidated
appeals
here,
which
seek
to
review
two
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
these
decisions
replaced
two
decrees
of
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county.
the
decrees
in
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county
were
entered
in
two
suits,
both
brought
against
the
city
of
miami.
one
suit
was
brought
by
ganger
as
a
class
action.
the
other
suit
was
brought
by
hamilton
as
a
class
action.
both
suits
challenged
the
legality
of
certain
special
assessments
which
the
city
of
miami
had
laid
upon
the
properties
of
persons
owning
property
along
certain
streets
in
the
town.
and
the
gravamen
of
the
complaints
in
both
cases
were
that
there
were
no
special
benefits
acclaimed
to
the
property
owners
as
a
result
of
the
--
of
the
proceedings
and
that
the
property
owners
had
no
notice
of
the
administrative
proceedings
which
resulted
in
the
imposition
of
the
assessment
liens.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
we
raised
it
throughout,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
throughout
the
entire
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
we
raised
it
in
the
complaint.
it
was
raised
in
the
assignments
of
errors
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
by
the
city
of
miami.
it
was
discussed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
its
first
and
second
opinions.
we
raised
it
in
our
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
--
on
the
last
and
first
opportunity
that
we
had
to
do
so
and
there
is
no
question
but
the
federal
question
is
implicit
in
the
entire
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it's
raised
in
the
complaint
in
paragraph
--
in
paragraph
12
on
page
6
of
the
record,
which
the
--
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
special
assessment
lien
sought
to
be
imposed
upon
the
abutting
property
owners
in
highway
improvement
district
h477,
are
illegal
and
void
and
constitute
taking
this
property
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
florida
upon
the
following
grounds,
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
on
page
7
of
the
record,
the
notice
was
published
in
an
inconspicuous
place
upon
the
classified
advertising
section
of
the
miami
herald,
the
position
in
which
it
was
least
likely
to
attract
the
attention
of
persons
such
as
the
plaintiffs
and
those
on
whom
this
--
on
whose
behalf
this
suit
was
brought.
and
the
court
below
found,
that
is
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county,
found
that
the
notice
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
and
set
aside
the
assessments
upon
that
ground.
now,
your
honors,
you
have,
of
course,
anticipated
me,
in
the
presentation
of
the
federal
question
involved,
which
is
whether
or
not,
a
municipality
in
the
imposition
of
the
special
assessment
lien
may
use
as
the
only
notice
which
it
gives
to
the
affected
property
owners
that
published
on
the
local
newspaper
where
the
owners
are
residents
of
the
area
in
which
the
proceedings
are
brought
and
their
names
and
addresses
are
in
the
possession
of
the
city.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
briefly
these.
the
city
of
miami
decided
to
resurface
certain
arterial
highways
which
had
become
worn
thin
and
to
make
the
same
more
suitable
for
the
passage
of
traffic.
the
streets
had
originally
been
put
in
at
the
cost
of
the
abutting
property
owners
who
had
paid
for
the
entire
amount,
except
for
the
intersection.
so
the
city
proceeded
onto
its
charter
to
do
the
work
and
that
determination
of
the
work
laid
in
assessment
upon
the
abutting
property
owners.
within
60
days
after
the
imposition
of
the
liens
and
the
receiving
of
the
notices
which
was
sent
to
them
by
mail,
although
the
only
notice
that
they
received
was
in
the
newspaper.
within
60
days
after
they
received
the
bills,
the
property
owners
organized
themselves
into
two
groups
and
proceeded
to
bring
these
separate
actions
challenging
the
legality
of
these
assessments.the
city
defended
the
suits
upon
the
ground
that
the
property
owner
were
estopped
to
allege
and
to
prove
that
these
assessments
did
not
result
in
benefits
to
their
properties.
of
course,
so
the
city
said
and
the
city
charter
provides
that
the
property
owners
would
have
notice
by
--
by
notices
published
in
the
local
newspapers
and
that
the
notices
were
so
published.
the
circuit
court
after
taking
a
substantial
amount
of
testimony,
found
contrary
to
the
city's
position
in
both
cases
and
enter
decrees
in
which
it
found
that
there
were
no
benefits
included
to
the
properties,
no
special
benefits
included
to
the
properties
as
a
result
of
the
resurfacing
that
it
had
been
done
to
facilitate
the
flow
of
traffic,
that
the
work
had
actually
been
paid
for
by
surfaces
accumulated
from
budgetary
estimates
in
prior
years,
that
the
notices
were
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
and
enjoined
the
collection
of
the
assessments.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
both
of
them.
there
were
two
notices
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
both
published
in
the
local
--
local
newspapers,
justice
clark.
the
city
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
from
that
decree
or
from
those
decrees.
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
affirmed
the
decrees
by
a
divided
court
that
is
4-to-3,
on
a
nonfederal
ground.
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
expressly
said,
"that
the
court
recognized
that
in
some
stage
in
the
proceedings
in
order
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
due
process,
notices
had
to
be
given."
but
he
said,
"the
notices
were
given
as
was
required
by
the
statute
and
therefore,
that
part
of
the
decree,
they
said,
was
wrong
and
they
disagreed
with
the
chancellor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
complaint
does
only
set
out
that
first
notice.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
in
the
trial
of
the
proceedings,
the
entire
administrative
proceedings
were
introduced
in
evidence.
and
the
--
and
the
proceedings
show
that
both
notices
were
published
in
the
local
newspapers
so
the
same
vice
attaches
to
the
second
notice
as
it
did
to
the
first.
and
i
think
the
court
below
treated
it
all
as
one
receipt
and
one
notice,
which
in
fact
it
was,
although,
there
were
two
separate
stages
of
the
game
at
which
the
notice
was
given.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
shall
briefly
at
this
point
explain
to
you
or
to
--
to
the
court
the
--
the
machinery
of
the
city
charter,
if
i
may,
it
may
interest
the
court
to
hear
it.
briefly,
the
proceedings
provided
for
all
these,
when
the
city
decides
to
--
to
initiate
a
public
improvement
such
as
the
resurfacing
or
the
painting
the
street,
it
adopts
what
is
known
as
an
initiating
resolution
and
it
gives
the
property
owner
notice
of
the
fact
that
that
resolution
has
been
adopted
and
requiring
him,
if
he
so
desires,
to
appear
and
contest
it.
now,
the
notice
does
not
--
is
not
required
to
specify
any
names
or
any
individuals
and
the
notice,
in
this
case,
was
published
directed
to
or
whom
it
may
concern
or
some
such
vague
reference
as
that.
all
persons
interested
may
take
notice.
then
when
the
initiating
resolution
has
been
confined
by
a
resolution,
the
city
then
proceeds
to
offer
or
to
invite
bids
for
the
doing
of
the
work.
and
when
they
are
received,
they
decide
then
either
to
let
to
work
out
on
contract,
its
own,
or
to
let
a
contract
for
the
doing
of
the
work
by
said
persons.
then
when
the
work
is
done
and
during
that
course
of
time,
a
special
assessment
role
is
made
up.
and
when
the
work
is
completed
and
the
cost
of
doing
the
work
has
been
exactly
determined,
a
special
assessment
rule,
a
preliminary
rule
is
corrected
to
show
the
actionable
facts,
and
then
the
city
gives
another
notice.
this
time,
twice
in
a
daily
newspaper
published
in
the
city.
and
at
that
time,
the
property
owners
are
required
to
come
and
register
their
objections
if
they
have
any,
to
the
imposition
of
these
assessment
liens.
and
if
their
objections
are
overruled,
they
may
then,
within
10
days
after
the
confirmation
of
the
rule,
bring
a
special
proceeding
in
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county
to
the
circuit
court,
in
which
they
may
challenge
the
legality
of
the
assessment.
and
in
that
proceeding,
the
circuit
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
entire
matter
and
to
set
aside
the
assessment
either
as
to
individual
lots
or
upon
the
entire
district.
that
procedure
was
followed
in
this
case
with
the
result
that
i
theretofore
state.
so
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
on
the
--
the
statutory
charter
of
the
city
of
miami
is,
in
our
opinion,
vague
on
that
point.
it
simply
says
that
a
notice
shall
be
given
to
all
whom
--
to
all
interested
that
at
certain
time
and
place,
the
--
their
objections
will
be
heard,
but
the
notice
in
this
case
simply
read
as
follows.
and
this
was
one
of
the
points
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
does
require.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
now
the
--
the
notice
stated
that
the
--
that
all
interested
will
take
notice
that
at
the
meeting
of
the
city
commissioner
at
9:30
--
o'clock
a.m.,
march
the
4th,
1953,
their
objection
will
be
heard
to
the
confirmation
of
the
preliminary
assessment
rule
for
the
cost
to
the
painting
of
the
improvements
on
the
following
avenues.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
the
similar
--
similar
notices
were
published
with
respect
to
both
of
them.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
as
your
honor
may
have
observed,
it
didn't
specify
any
place.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
if
a
notice
does
not
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
the
notice
did
not
do
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
my
recollection
of
it.
i'm
not
entirely
clear
about
the
precise
language
of
that
charter.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
we
have
it
here
in
the
appendix
to
the
--
to
the
brief.
and
with
your
honor's
indulgence,
i
will
--
i
will
read.
“a
notice
stating
at
a
regular
meeting
of
the
commission
held
on
a
certain
day
and
not
last
than
12
days
from
the
date
of
the
first
publication,
all
interested
persons
may
appear
and
file
written
objections
to
the
confirmation
of
the
rule.”
so,
as
your
honor
will
see,
there's
no
special
requirement
in
the
charter
that
the
time
and
place
of
the
meeting
be
specified
in
the
notice.
and
the
notice
does
comply
with
the
city
charter.
now,
i
have
proceeded
through
the
case
to
the
point
where
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
affirmed
the
decree,
but
i
did
not
tell
the
court
the
ground
on
which
that
is
reversed
or
funded.
but
i
did
not
tell
the
court
the
grounds
on
which
that
affirmation
rested.
the
majority
opinion
said
that
the
city
of
miami,
under
its
charter,
had
no
statutory
power
to
assess
for
resurfacing
as
distinguished
from
repeating.
and
so
the
decree
was
affirmed
upon
a
work
or
statutory
power
in
the
city.
one
of
the
justices
filed
a
especially
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
said
that
evidence
are
bounded
to
support
the
court's
finding
that
there
were
no
special
benefits
in
support
for
this
assessment.
and
on
that
ground,
he
was
willing
to
put
his
position.
and,
of
course,
the
law
had
plain
that
if
there
were
no
benefits,
there
was
no
constitutional
basis
for
the
--
the
assessment,
whether
the
party
had
noticed
or
not.
the
city
petitioned
for
rehearing.
and
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
it
is
asserted
that
the
judge
who
had
filed
this
concurring
opinion
and
whose
presence
on
there
side
was
essential
because
they
were
four
from
outside
and
three
at
fault,
that
that
judge
had
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
notice
has
been
given
as
required
by
the
charter.
and
so
on
the
strength
of
that
petition
for
rehearing,
a
--
a
rehearing
was
granted.
and
when
the
cause
came
on
to
be
heard
on
rehearing,
we
obtained
--
we
filed
with
the
court
a
brief,
a
printed
copy
which
i
have
here,
certified
to
by
the
clerk
of
the
court,
in
which
i
should
like
to
ask
your
honors'
leave
to
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court,
in
which
we
precisely
raised
the
question
decided
by
this
court
in
the
city
--
or
in
walker
against
the
city
of
hutchinson
and
called
this
--
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
assertion
had
been
entered
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
was
on
the
--
or
it
was
at
the
time
when
the
rehearing
had
been
granted,
but
at
that
time
with
argument
on
it.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
was
not
the
brief
they
struck,
justice
harlan.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
on
rehearing,
they
granted
--
on
rehearing
granted,
the
court
reversed
the
decree.
the
judge
who
had
filed
the
specially
concurring
opinion
reciting
the
award
of
benefits,
having
joined
the
minority
and
thereby
constituted
a
majority
of
the
court
which
reversed
the
case
and
held
that
the
property
owners
were
estopped
by
the
administrative
proceedings
to
show
the
award
of
benefits
and
all.
now,
at
that
point
then,
and
this
was
for
the
first
time
that
the
appellants
here
had
had
an
opportunity
to
bring
this
matter
squarely
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
attention.
at
that
point,
the
appellants
here,
petitioned
for
rehearing
on
their
own
account
and
expressly
alleged
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
which
is
in
the
record
on
page
65,
paragraph
4,
they
expressly
alleged
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
the
court
failed
that
in
holding
that
the
notice
of
the
confirmation
of
the
assessment
rules
sufficient
and
that
the
appellees
were
estopped
to
challenge
the
lack
of
benefits
because
they
had
failed
to
object
pursuant
to
the
notice,
the
court
overlooked
or
failed
to
consider
that
the
procedure
for
the
imposition
of
assessment
lien
is
quasi-judicial,
and
that
the
requirements
of
procedural
due
process
guaranteed
by
amendment
fourteen
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
must
be
complied
with.
in
the
case
of
resident's
constructive
notice,
as
attempted,
is
violative
of
the
rights
secured
by
such
amendment
citing
walker
against
city
of
hutchinson
and
mullane
against
central
hanover
bank
and
trust
company.
it
might
not
be
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
except
that
i
should
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
this
fact
that
in
the
--
in
the
conclusion
to
the
brief
which
we
had
previously
filed
at
the
time
the
case
was
reheard
on
the
same
petition
for
rehearing,
we
stated
in
the
conclusion
that
the
notice
was
insufficient
and
deceptively
published.
it
was
a
formal
process.
being
so,
it
was
subject
to
constitutional
requirements
of
due
process.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
on
page
52
of
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
a
certified
copy
of
which
i
have
here
upon
the
file
that
was
collected
in
this
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
and
that
is
mentioned
in
our
brief
on
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
our
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
correct.
so
it
brings
us
squarely
within
the
rules
of
saunders
against
shaw,
(inaudible)
trust
company
case
and
the
numerous
other
parts
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
certainly
may,
justice
harlan.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
pardon?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
justice
harlan,
i
evidently,
did
not
make
myself
clear
when
i
attempted
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
at
the
time
that
we
brought
the
lawsuit,
the
entire
administrative
proceeding
had
been
concluded,
the
work
had
been
done,
and
the
second
notice
and
the
confirmation
of
the
assessment
rule
had
been
completed.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
the
whole
thing
had
been
done.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
so
when
the
court
made
its
final
decree,
everything
was
over
and
it
was
a
final
determination
that
the
liens
were
no
good.
it
was
only
after
the
entry
of
that
second
notice
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
the
whole
proceeding
in
the
court
below
was
treated
as
though
the
final
notice
were
the
ones
that
were
actually
talked
about.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
agree
with
you
that
it
was
only
the
first
notice
which
was
specifically
required
to
in
the
complaint.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
actually,
the
case
it
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
both
notices
were
invalid.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
it
was
all
the
same
thing
because
it
was
virtually
all
the
same
notice.
they
were
just
published
at
different
stages
of
the
proceedings.
but
as
far
as
the
constitutional
question
was
concerned,
the
notice
was
insufficient
in
both
cases.
that
is
to
say
it
was
published
in
the
newspaper
and
it
did
not
contain
the
requirements
of
notice
that
we
think
the
--
that
the
lower
court
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
except
all
--
everybody
in
the
case
has
treated
the
matter
as
though
the
attack
was
upon
the
final
assessment
nor
--
or
liens
based
upon
both
notices.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
that
regard,
the
first
notice
is
immaterial.
i
think
and
that
perhaps
on
this
impression
that
the
first
notice
was
referred
to
as
it
was
in
the
complaint,
because
it's
the
second
notice
that
is
given
at
the
time
that
the
liens
were
enforced
and
that
is
the
one
substance
--
substantially
that
the
court
dealt
with
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
if
the
first
notice
was
bad
and
the
second
notice
was
good,
the
assessment
would
be
good.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
correct.
and
the
second
notice
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
same
vice.
it
was
all
treated
as
the
same
matter.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
we
held
a
number
of
rules
for
that,
but
the
court
treated
the
matter
as
though
it
was
just
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
there
never
has
been
any
differentiation
in
the
court
or
anywhere
about
this
first
and
second
notice
until
this
moment.
nobody
--
we've
all
regarded
as
simply
the
same
thing,
because
the
vices
are
here
in
both
notices.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
justice
whittaker.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
justice
whittaker,
if
i
may
be
pardoned
for
saying
so,
i
think
that
the
attention
which
the
court
maybe
given
to
this
first
notice
at
the
moment
is
somewhat
immaterial
for
this
reason.
it
is
a
fact
that
the
first
notice
is
the
only
that's
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
complaint
alleges
in
paragraph
12,
which
i
read
to
you
from
page
6
of
the
record,
that
the
special
assessment
liens
sought
to
be
imposed
were
unconstitutional
and
void
because
for
the
several
reasons
including
the
fact
that
the
notice
was
published
in
an
conspicuous
place
from
the
classified
advertising
section
of
the
herald.
now,
the
liens
could
not
have
come
into
existence
until
after
the
giving
of
the
second
notice.
and
so
what,
in
effect,
happened
was
that
in
framing
the
complaint,
the
first
notice
in
1950
was
picked
up
instead
of
the
one
in
1952.
but
it's
all
the
same
form
of
notice
and
then
--
and
both
notices
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
have
the
same
vices.
and
the
whole
matter
was
so
treated
by
all
the
courts
below.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
not
under
the
doctrine
of
the
walker
or
walker
against
the
city
of
hutchinson
and
the
wisconsin
electric
power
corporation
against
the
city
of
milwaukee,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
lack
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
in
the
walker
case,
there
was
a
publication
in
the
city
--
the
city
had
an
official
journal.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
the
court
case
did
not
turn
upon
the
number
of
publications,
for
example,
in
new
york
and
new
haven
railway
company
case,
there
was
a
publication
twice.
now
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
as
far
as
resident
property
owners
are
concerned,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
because
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
because
as
justice
jackson
observed
in
the
mullane
case,
chance,
although
one,
brings
to
the
attention
of
a
person
in
--
within
the
--
the
confines
of
a
--
a
jurisdiction
or
a
notice
on
the
newspaper
that
his
rights
are
being
affected.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
justice
frankfurter,
the
mullane
case
was
followed
in
the
new
hartford
railroad
company
case.
that
case
was
followed
by
walker
against
the
city
of
hutchinson
which
is
awfully
close
to
the
point.
and
all
of
the
cases
were
followed
as
far
as
i
know
in
some
memorandum
decisions
and
i
can't
answer
otherwise
in
--
in
wisconsin
electric
power
corporation
against
the
city
of
milwaukee,
which
is
a
case
directly
in
point.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
because
it
involved
a
special
assessment.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
defined
the
--
the
decisions
or
has
reversed
the
decision
upon
the
ground
that
the
constitution
requirements
of
due
process
have
been
complied
with
and
that
is
approximately,
we
have
before
this
court.
there
is
also
a
further
question
as
to
a
violation
of
our
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
my
partner
will
refer
to
in
a
few
moments.
but
let
me
go
one
step
further
and
explain
to
the
court,
if
i
may,
about
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
wisconsin
electric
power
company
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
justice
harlan,
there
is
no
reference
in
the
complaint
to
the
second
notice.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
nowhere
else,
but
the
entire
assessment
rule
and
all
of
the
notices
were
put
in
evidence
by
the
defendant.
the
defendant
alleged
that
we
were
bound
by
the
second
notice.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
in
the
defendant's
answer
at
page
10
of
the
record.
and
--
and
you
will
find
at
page
--
or
rather
page
13,
as
the
answer
starts
at
page
10.
“the
answer
alleges
that
the
defendant
further
alleges
that
claims
in
each
of
them
and
each
of
those
persons
who
plaintiffs
purport
to
represent
herein,
will
under
the
duty
by
reason
to
be
improperly
and
legally
notified
to
appealed
object,
to
file
their
written
objections
with
the
city
clerk
of
the
defendants
or
the
confirmation
of
the
assessment
rule
as
required
by
section
56
(1)
(m)
on
the
said
city
charter
and
special
act.
and
it
was
on
that
ground
if
the
case
was
tried.
and
the
court
held
that
--
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
by
his
estoppel
that
he
pleaded
that
we
were
bound
by
the
administrative
proceeding.
and
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
they
put
the
whole
record
in
evidence
including
that
notice
and
the
antecedent
notices.
and
it
was
those
notices
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
it
was
for
the
estoppel
rising
out
of
that
notice
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
that
we
were
bound
by
the
administrative
proceeding.
now
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
i
--
i
can
only
say
this,
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
city
attacked
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
notice.
and
the
lower
court
held
that
the
notice
was
invalid
and
i
can
only
assume
that
the
court
was
talking
about
the
second
one,
because
otherwise
the
liens
would
not
have
been
imposed.
and
the
lower
court
held
that
--
that
was
invalid.
the
city
assigned
that
holding
as
error
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
says
that
they
disagree
with
the
chancellor
on
that
point.
namely,
that
the
holding
--
that
the
notice
was
insufficient
under
the
due
process
clause.
but
they
said
the
city
had
no
power
solely
when
they
--
so
they
have
found
the
decree?
then
on
rehearing
in
which
the
city
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
--
to
the
requirements
of
the
charter
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
notice
under
the
due
process
clause,
said
the
room
--
the
courtroom
advised
itself.
then
on
now
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
correct,
your
honor.
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
was
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
complaint.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
we
brought
this
matter
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
attention,
earn
that
petition
for
rehearing
that
their
holding
was
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
the
cited
cases.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
do
not
think
so.
if
you
will
observe
from
the
record
the
--
the
brief
laying
in
the
supreme
court
for
a
quite
a
long
period
of
time
before
it
was
struck
and
a
curious
thing
happened
on
that
petition
of
rehearing,
one
of
the
justices
who
had
been
consistently
against
us
throughout
these
proceedings,
justice
hudson,
came
over
to
our
side.
and
actually,
we
would
have
won
the
case
at
that
point,
i
think,
on
the
constitutional
ground.
he
voted
to
grant
our
petition
for
rehearing.
but
by
--
and
one
of
those
strange
courts
that
--
or
has
never
befallen
me
before,
the
chief
justice,
who
had
been
on
our
side
throughout
the
proceedings
defected
to
the
other
side
and
so
we
still
only
have
three
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
he
changed
his
mind,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
intended
this
morning
to
put
this
case
in
what
i
thought
was
a
proper
focus
by
emphasizing
to
the
court
that
basically,
the
question
involved
here
was
whether
or
not
these
property
owners
received
a
special
benefit
to
their
property
different
from
that
enjoyed
by
the
rest
of
the
people
in
the
city
because,
without
that
foundation,
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
imposing
upon
those
people
any
different
burden
than
that
called
upon
the
other
people
in
the
municipality.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
the
city
of
miami
had
given
the
property
owners
a
notice
in
writing
every
day
that
they
were
going
to
levy
the
assessments
and
that
had
it
served
that
notice
upon
them
personally.
if
the
doing
of
the
work
had
not
conferred
any
benefit
upon
that
abutting
property,
the
city
of
miami,
and
no
other
city,
would
have
had
any
right
to
have
the
imposed
cost
upon
those
people.
and
there
isn't
any
serious
doubt
about
that
proposition
in
all
the
courts
of
this
country,
including
this,
which
have
considered
that
question.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
benefit
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so,
but
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir,
but
i
would
like
to
say
this
to
the
court,
if
i
may,
that
there
is
vast
difference
between
a
legislative
determination
of
benefit
which
is
made
by
the
assembled
people
or
legislators
in
a
state
and
that
made
by
a
body
to
which
that
power
has
been
delegated
and
the
statements
are
well
put
in
american
jurisprudence,
and
if
i
may
ask
your
honor's
indulgence,
i
should
read
it
to
you.
contrary
to
the
view
stated
in
the
preceding
paragraph
which
discusses
the
question
concerning
the
legislative
determination
of
benefits,
it
has
been
ruled
that
where
the
legislature
of
a
state
does
not,
itself,
act
in
determining
an
improvement
district
or
area
or
making
a
special
or
local
assessment
that
delegates
the
power
to
do
the
same
thing
to
some
subordinate
body.
due
process
of
law
requires
that
in
some
stage
of
the
proceedings
before
the
assessment
becomes
irrevocably
fixed,
the
property
owner
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
of
which,
he
must
have
notice,
either
personal
or
by
publication
or
by
a
law
fixing
the
time
and
place
of
hearing,
the
proceedings
in
such
instance
or
in
a
natured
judicial,
in
the
sense
that
such
right
to
notice
and
hearing
exists.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir.
as
far
my
understanding
is
concerned,
it
doesn't,
but
i
can't
answer
your
honor's
question.
i
certainly
am
not
that
familiar
with
this.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
legislature
may
confer
no
such
power
upon
the
--
upon
the
municipality.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think
it
would.
i
agree
with
your
honor
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
because
this
is
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
may
have
the
power,
your
honor,
to
that
but
it
doesn't
have
the
power
to
impose
the
burden
upon
the
people
without
notice
and
without
benefit.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir,
i
do
not
think
that
power
exists.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
the
legislature
may,
as
in
the
case
of
the
drainage
districts,
because
everybody
knows
what
is
going
on
in
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
they
are
theoretically
assumed
to
know
that,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
said,
i
was
trying
to
discuss
this
matter
of
the
actual
existence
of
these
benefits
and
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
fact,
that
the
circuit
judge
who
tried
this
case,
and
this
finding
comes
to
this
court
in
my
opinion
with
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
correctness.
the
circuit
judge
found
that
no
special
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
benefit
was
conferred
upon
the
abiding
property
by
the
resurfacing
of
said
streets
and
the
benefit
which
was
derived
there
from
was
general
and
not
special.
now,
when
the
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
sir?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
was
not
a
repaving,
your
honor.
it
was
a
resurfacing
of
the
street.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir.
it
was
done
in
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
sir?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
if
it
could
be
called
such,
it
was
done
on
a
few
streets
between
the
arterial
highways
in
downtown
miami.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
to
say
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir,
that
everybody
in
the
city
of
miami
who
were
bearing
the
cost
that
they
got
out
of
a
general
fund
should
be
paid
for
out
of
the
general
funds.
that's
what
that
means.
now,
when
the
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
one
of
the
justices
who
subsequently
changed
his
opinion
and
run
over
to
the
other
side
said
this
in
a
specially
concurring
opinion.
“here,
the
trial
judge
specifically
found
that
the
work
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
public
and
the
abiding
owners
received
no
special
benefit.
the
record
of
balance
in
evidence
more
than
adequate
to
sustain
this
conclusion.”
and
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
he
lived
on
a
street
near
the
intersection
of
a
highway
to
key
west,
which
justice
black
referred
to
on
yesterday,
and
that
the
passage
of
that
traffic
up
and
down
that
street
had
made
his
street
worse
and
that
he
would
pay
the
city
double
if
they
just
hadn't
done
the
work
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir,
this
was
justice
thornal.
now,
you
should
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
not
sit
in
judgment
on
him.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
he
may
have
had
a
legal
reason
for
changing
his
mind,
and
i
think
he
did,
but
he
certainly
couldn't
change
his
opinion
about
the
facts.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
he
stated
that
to
be
a
fact.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
because
the
question
of
benefits
was
not
seriously
challenged
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
was
no
serious
challenges
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
facts
to
support
the
judgment
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think
that
you
are
bound
by
what
the
trial
judge
found
and
there
isn't
any
contrary
finding
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
justice
black,
justice
thomas
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
for
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
the
city
lacked
the
power
to
resurface
as
opposed
to
repave.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
on
that
point
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
on
that
point,
the
--
justice
thomas
had
this
to
say.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
isn't
any
definite
finding
about
that,
but
i
would
like
for
the
--
for
the
--
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
the
court,
i
want
to
read
the
court,
for
a
brief
second,
a
statement
from
justice
thomas'
opinion.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
the
first
opinion.
now,
when
it
went
up
on
the
--
when
--
when
the
--
when
the
case
was
heard
on
rehearing,
the
case
went
entirely
off
on
the
matter
of
a
estoppels.
that
we
had
failed
to
file
these
objections
to
the
administrative
proceedings
and
you've
taken
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
within
10
days,
hence,
we
could
not
raise
the
question
of
benefits,
and
that
is
the
point
on
which
the
court
ultimately
rested
its
decision.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
do
not
find
that
as
a
fact,
justice
black.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
court's
opinion,
although
the
case
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
turned
upon
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
now,
i
would
like,
however,
because
this
matter
seems
to
have
engaged
the
attention
of
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
discuss
for
a
moment
the
question
as
to
the
matter
of
this
discrimination
which
was
injected
into
the
case
in
which
counsel
said
that
we
have
improperly
brought
to
this
court
for
its
consideration.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
in
the
jurisdictional
statement?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
is
raised
in
the
brief,
justice
brennan.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it
is
raised
--
it
is
raised
in
the
--
no,
i
think,
your
honor
is
correct.
i
do
not
think
that
that
question
is
directly
raised
by
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
perhaps
we
are
not,
but
we
put
that
into
our
brief
as
a
means
of
showing
the
situation
that
had
existed
with
respect
to
these
property
owners
and
for
the
information
of
the
court,
if
i
may
go
this
much
further
and
explain
our
position
to
the
court.
it
--
the
matter
is
not
as
counsel
represented
to
the
court,
some
hybrid
piece
of
paper
that
has
been
brought
to
this
court.
it
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
our
petition
for
rehearing.
on
page
67
of
the
record,
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
motion
to
supplement
this
record
had
been
filed
and
that
the
matter
presented
a
case
for
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
but
the
court,
at
the
time
that
it
entered
the
order
on
the
motion
to
--
for
the
brief,
struck
this
or
denied
our
motion
to
supplement
the
record,
and
that
order
is
in
this
record
contrary
to
statements
--
to
counsel's
statement.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honors,
will
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
you
could
then
--
you
could
then,
perhaps,
or
you
could
then,
if
you
will,
bring
here
the
impropriety
or
illegality
under
the
federal
constitution
of
the
failure
of
your
court
to
allow
you
to
raise
it
but
you
can't
bring
the
merits
of
the
point
here
in
any
event.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
i
was
just
trying
to
explain
to
your
honors
that
this
was
not
a
matter
that
we
had
dragged
physically
into
this
court,
that
it
had
been
presented
to
and
decide
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
and
the
order
denying
it,
contrary
to
what
counsel
said,
is
in
the
record
on
page
70.
now,
on
the
question
of
this
notice
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
70,
justice
black,
the
motion
of
appellees
to
amend
the
order
denying
petition
to
supplement
record
has
been
duly
considered
and
is
denied.
so
--
so,
the
matter
was
in
the
record
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
it
is
in
this
record
here.
now,
whether
the
court
thinks
it
should
be
considered
under
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
we
filed
is
quite
another
matter,
but
it
was
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
for
its
consideration.
now,
i'm
sure
that
my
time
must
be
running
out
and
i
have
only
very
few
minutes
left
and
i
shall
like
to
ask
your
honors'
indulgence
for
a
few
moments
to
consider
this
question
of
this
notice.
this
is
an
exhibit
which
was
attached
to
the
complaint
in
the
case
which
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
it
contains
a
little
paragraph
up
here
which
contains
the
notice
of
the
hearing
on
this
original
initiating
assessment.
that
is
not
quite
as
big
as
the
pages
o
the
miami
herald,
but
it
is
a
photostatic
copy
of
the
page
from
the
paper
in
which
this
notice
appeared
and
it's
here
among
the
original
records
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
think
that's
a
facetious
question
and
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
answer
your
honor
candidly.
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
made
a
particle
of
difference
as
long
as
we
are
concerned
with
the
situation
regarding
resident
property
owners.
but
of
course,
and
the
reason
we
mention
this
among
other
things
in
our
argument
is
that
in
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
i
think,
in
the
malaney
case,
i
think
it
was
that
justice
black
in
that
opinion
referred
to
a
matter
being
tucked
away
upon
an
obscure
page
in
the
newspaper,
a
notice
not
directed
to
anybody
in
particular
and
which
was
not
likely
to
come
to
the
attention
even
of
a
person's
friends.
and
he
says
that
the
purpose
of
notice
was
to
get
information
to
a
person,
and
of
course,
it
follows,
and
i
am
not
quoting
his
opinion
there,
of
course
it
follows
that
the
more
inconspicuous
the
place
is,
if
the
notice
is
published,
the
least
likely
it
is
that
it
shall
come
to
the
attention
of
him
who
is
to
be
affected
by
it.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i'm
glad
your
honor
mentioned
that
point
because
that
question
is
dealt
with
in
the
--
in
the
--
depositions
themselves.
now,
remember,
all
of
these
people
did
not
live
on
all
of
these
streets.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
dupont
building
is
on
one
corner,
the
miami
herald
building
is
on
the
other,
the
ingraham
building
is
on
another.
there's
a
large
department
store
on
another,
and
one
of
the
individuals
in
the
case
testified,
and
he
was
supported
by
the
city
engineer,
that
the
matter
of
maintenance
of
these
streets,
because
of
these
potholes
that
have
been
developing
all
the
time,
were
so
constant
that
they
had
to
put
him
to
do
the
work
on
sundays.
and
he
said
they
never
had
made
assessments
against
him
before
and
why
should
he
have
thought
that
they
were
going
to
make
assessments
for
street
repairing,
and
it's
a
perfectly
logical
thing.
but
to
show,
your
honor,
that
they
acted
as
promptly
as
they
could
and
to
correct
the
statement
which
was
made
by
counsel
yesterday,
this
case
was
not
filed
three
years
after
this
matter
was
instituted.
the
assessment
district
in
the
hamilton
case,
and
by
the
way
that
may
call
for
some
explanation
because
some
facetious
comment
was
made
by
counsel
regarding
the
fact
that
we
tried
the
brief
on
one
side
and
named
it
in
the
other,
the
case
that
we
actually
tried
and
we
were
solicited
to
participate
in
these
proceedings
by
a
group
of
property
owners
was
the
name
of
hamilton.
the
district
was
created
before
the
ganger
district
and
we
were
ready
and
had
taken
our
case
--
or
the
city
had
taken
our
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
before
the
ganger
case
was
ever
filed.
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
that
the
complaint
was
a
valid
--
or
was
attacked
upon
the
ordinance
and
it
had
this
notice
in
it.
so,
the
whole
matter
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
we
were
trying
the
hamilton
case
and
the
ganger
case,
involving
fewer
streets
in
a
much
smaller
district,
sort
of
just
came
along
with
it.
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
for
some
unaccountable
reason,
the
opinion
was
written
in
the
ganger
case,
but
all
the
main
briefs
are
dealing
with
these
questions
were
entitled
in
the
hamilton
case
and
that
is
why
we
have
stressed
the
fact
of
hamilton
although,
of
course,
the
names
make
no
difference.
but
now,
on
the
question
of
this
timing,
the
confirming
resolution
in
the
hamilton
district
was
added
on
march
18th,
1953.
then,
the
city
sent
bills
to
these
people.
counsel
has
said,
“well,
we
couldn't
possibly
have
given
them
personal
notice
of
the
assessment
because
it
would
have
been
too
expensive
and
the
ownerships
might
have
changed.”
but
when
they
sent
them
the
bills,
they
mailed
it
out
to
the
right
people
and
all
of
their
names
and
addresses
were
on
file
with
the
city
clerk,
and
they
are
in
the
records
of
this
court
as
represented
by
the
assessment
rule.
now,
within
48
days
after
that
resolution
was
confirmed,
we
filed
the
hamilton
suit.
it
was
filed
on
may
5th,
1953.
it
went
to
--
the
judge
ruled
in
our
favor
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
complaint
in
july
and
it
was
decided
in
our
favor
per
curiam
on
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
the
following
september.
so,
it
was
not
any
lapse
of
time,
such
as
two
or
three
years,
or
any
period
like
that.
it
failed
between
the
time
of
the
doing
--
the
happening
of
these
events
and
the
challenge
to
it.
and
indeed,
i
do
not
see
how
the
people
could
have
gotten
together
and
gotten
into
court
much
more
quickly
than
they
did
and
are
about
the
same
amount
of
time
lapsed
in
the
ganger
case.
that
suit
was
filed
or
the
confirming
resolution
there
was
done
in
the
year
later,
on
february
18th,
1954,
and
the
suit
was
filed
on
april
1st,
fall.
so
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
the
act
permits
the
city
manager
to
make
a
recommendation
to
the
city
commission
as
to
how
the
benefit
shall
be
assessed
and
it
specifies
that
it
may
be
on
the
front-foot
rule.
and
the
city
manager
made
such
a
recommendation
and
the
city
commission
adopted
it.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
was
the
way
it
was
handled.
now
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
was
the
--
there
was
no
deviation
from
the
procedure
prescribed
by
the
statute.
they
followed
the
statute
all
the
way
through.
now,
apparently,
i
just
got
a
few
moments
to
conclude.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
the
city
claims
that
by
reason
of
our
failure
to
object
in
the
administrative
proceedings
and
by
our
failure
to
take
the
10-day
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
we
were
thereafter
precluded
from
objecting
to
any
of
the
notices
or
any
of
the
resolutions
and
thereby,
we
have
become
estopped
to
set
up
the
fact
that
benefits
did
not
accrue
to
us.
but
the
question
was
actually
--
have
i
answered
your
honor's
question?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir,
we
do
not
challenge
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
we
did
challenge
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
the
apportionment
proceeding
was
invalid?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there's
no
such
charge
as
that
made
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no
such
charge.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
on
the
grounds
that
the
city
had
no
right
to
resurface
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
any
charge.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
also
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
if
we
had
proceeded
within
the
10-day
period
that
they
said
we
should
have
proceeded,
instead
of
48
days,
we
could
have
raised
any
question
we
wanted
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
so,
they
are
trying
to
bind
us
by
a
10-day
period
when,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
only
48
days
has
elapsed.
now
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
i
could
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
was
--
the
basis
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
final
determination
was
that
the
property
owners
were
estopped
to
set
up
a
ward
of
benefits
because
they
had
failed
to
take
the
administrative
proceedings
that
were
required
by
the
statute
and
to
bring
a
proceeding
in
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county
within
10
days
after
the
final
confirmation
of
the
assessment.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
question
the
state's
right
to
impose
the
burden
of
the
benefits
upon
us
or,
really,
to
impose
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
benefits.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
now,
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
the
legislative
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
sir.
no,
your
--
your
honor.
this
court
has
held
that
legislative
determination
of
benefits
come
to
this
court
with
the
presumption
of
correctness
about
them.
i
will
not
be
and
say
that
point.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
the
constitutional
question,
but
it
must
be
understood
with
the
light
of
this
statement,
that
actually,
the
question
of
benefits
was
tried
by
the
circuit
court
and
they
found
that
we
had
received
no
benefit.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
now,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
says,
in
effect,
that
the
circuit
court
never
had
any
right
to
try
this
question
of
benefits
because
we
had
not
objected
in
the
administrative
proceedings
and
taken
a
special
case
to
the
circuit
court
within
10
days.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
we
have
raised
that
as
one
of
our
questions,
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
it's
sort
of
mixed
in
there.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think
there's
two
separate
questions,
whether
we
have
the
notice
and
whether
the
10-day
limitation
is
also
a
due
process
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i'm
not
trying
to
dodge
your
question,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
say
that
and
i
also
say
that
if
the
--
if
the
department
which
imposed
the
burden
had
not
also
conferred
a
benefit
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
question
which
we
would
likewise
have
a
right
to.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
we
never
had
any
notice,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
so,
you
can't
raise
something
without
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
all
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
10
days
is
too
short.
