--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get

is
this,
before

of
your
supreme

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
the
supreme
court?
justice

j.
brennan,

difference
between

the
assessment
or
the
project,
which?
justice

wanted
--
i
want
to
get
this
clear.

the
--
you

mean.

--
that
they
--
that
there
will
be
a
street
improvement,
that's
all
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
charges
by
way
of
assessment
for
the
cost
of

the
--
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
june
3rd,
1953
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ferrell,
would
you
look
at
page
102.
you
told
mr.
justice
frankfurter
the
significance
of
the
notice
of
94.
as
i
understand
it,
you
get
down
at
the
clerk's
office
and
find
out
what
preliminary
assessment
is.
now,
what's
this
at
page
102?
the
improvement
lien
register,
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
what
you
see
if
you
get
down
and
look?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
--
if
the
cost
to
each
abutting
property
in
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
appears
here
by
name
and
address
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
so
forth,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
amount?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
last
step
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
there
was
no
discrimination.
therefore,
there
was
no
oppressive
arbitrary
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
he,
in
the
notice
of
motion
that
you're
reading
from,
referred
or
claimed
that
he
had
not
attacked
the
second
notice
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
the
issue
below,
you
failed
to
point
out
as
to
where
the
question
is
presented
in.
you
presented
that
in
parts
of
the
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
where
do
you
expect
me
to
read
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
you
entitled
to
benefits?
