(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
basic
point,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
this
alleged
conspiracy
was
not
a
conspiracy
to
the
total
exclusion
of
the
market
but
a
conspiracy
to
exclude
you
from
having
your
films
compete
on
equal
terms
with
those
of
other
companies,
other
distributors,
isn't
that
(voice

i
ask
you

big
jump.

case

supposing
section
5
of

one
reason
or
another,
is
not
available
to
you,
have
you
got
enough
evidence
in
this
case
to
hold
--
to
make
a
case
or
is
it
all
stand
--
stand
or
fall
on
the
section
5?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
your
statistical
approach
however,
undermined
seriously
by
the
district
court's
findings
as
to
the
quality
of
your
pictures?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
not?
justice
john
m.

is
there
evidence
to
that
effect?

and

decide
to
ask

was
the

m.
harlan
as
i
understand
neither
of
your
making
any
point
about
that
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
this
cover
the
whole
period
of
the
alleged
conspiracy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
government
file
an
amicus
brief
in
the

john
m.
harlan
could

before

down,
mr.
gillespie.
the
last
sentence
of

waterman's
opinion
--
sorry
to
hold
you
up.
justice
john
m.
harlan
705,
thank
you
very
much.
he
says,
‚Äùsince
the
conspiracy
was
not
proven,
we
do
not
examine
the
questions
plaintiff
raises
--
raised
relating
to
the
elements
of
the
alleged
damage
they
claim
they
have
suffered
with
respect
to
which
much
of
their
expert
testimony
is
directed.
i
take
it
that
you
interpret
that
as
referring
not
to
impact
but
to
monetary
damage,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
