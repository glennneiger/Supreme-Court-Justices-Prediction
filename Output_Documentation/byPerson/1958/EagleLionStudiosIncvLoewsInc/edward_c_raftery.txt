mr.
edward
c.
raftery
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i'm
going
to
try
to
comply
in
my
time
to
25
minutes
so
as
to
leave
the
bulk
to
mr.
gillespie.
and
i'll
try
to
talk
primarily
on
the
facts
leaving
the
lower
points,
if
there
are
any,
and
i
don't
know
of
any,
to
mr.
gillespie.
what
is
eagle
lion?
a
company
called
prc,
producers
releasing
corporation,
was
formed
in
1943.
by
1946,
the
record
shows
it
was
hopelessly
broke,
and
owed
a
lot
of
money
to
a
company
controlled
by
a
robert
young,
pathé
laboratories
for
unpaid
print
bills,
that's
the
negatives
and
the
prints.
the
company
made
very
cheap
pictures.
they
never
saw
the
light
of
day
in
any
first
class
house
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
--
concerned.
pathé
industries
took
over
prc
for
that.
prc
was
the
great
foundation
upon
which
eagle
lion
was
built.
eagle
lion
was,
as
you
can
tell
from
the
name,
was
a
british-american
idea.
mr.
rank
in
london
would
produce
for
lion
films.
the
eagles
would
fly
here
in
this
country.
now
a
contract
was
signed,
that's
in
evidence,
between
the
rank
company
and
this
new
eagle
lion
company
here
which
had
taken
over
prc.
the
witness
said
he
didn't
know
of
it
by
merger
or
how
--
where
eagle
lion
was
going
to
make
a
number
of
pictures.
that
is,
lion
would
make
them
in
england
and
eagle
would
make
them
over
here.
that
also
had
another
hedge
to
it.
the
hedge
was
--
was
that
the
good
pictures,
if
there
were
any
good
ones
made
in
england
would
go
to
universal
for
distribution.
and
the
codes,
ultimately
would
come
to
eagle
lion,
so
the
second
part
of
the
foundation
on
british
pictures
on
top
of
the
prc.
so
they
formed
another
company
called
eagle
lion
studios
and
they
purchased
an
old
studio
out
in
california.
they
put
a
man
named
foy
at
the
head
of
it.
now,
according
to
the
witness
examined
by
judge
dawson,
the
man
who
was
vice-president
in
charge
of
all
exploitation
at
eagle
lion,
mr.
foy
was
a
very
competent
producer
of
b-pictures
but
it
never
had
any
experience
in
producing
good
pictures.
he
referred
to
it
in
answer
to
the
court's
question
that
eagle
lion
was
more
or
less
an
amalgam
of
impossibles.
that
is
he
said,
“taken
the
company
from
the
drags
of
the
american
industry
adding
to
it
an
untried
british
product
and
putting
a
man
with
b-studio
experience
in
charge
of
production.”
now,
that
is
the
--
briefly
the
--
the
genesis
and
origin
of
eagle
lion.
when
that
started
functioning
in
1946
and
the
first
group
of
pictures
that
--
that
distribute
did
according
to
one
of
the
charts
prepared
and
offered
in
evidence,
i
think
it's
exhibit
11,
and
i
must
confess,
my
friends
didn't
print
it
in
the
record.
so
i'm
going
to
use
my
analysis
of
it
which
is
in
evidence
and
which
we
have
submitted
to
your
honors
in
protostat
form.
those
are
the
rko
exhibits,
i
think
there
are
five
or
six
of
it.
now,
the
first
year,
the
top
grossing
pictures
they
had
for
1946,
1947
are
reissues,
and
i
don't
know
--
know
whether
your
honors
are
familiar
with
the
way
and
some
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
on
the
reissues.
this
is
the
finding
of
fact,
i
think
that
judge
harlan
was
referring
to,
page
578
of
the
record.
although
practically
all
the
films
distributed
by
the
plaintiffs
were
inferior
in
quality
and
drawing
part
to
those
--
those
distributed
by
the
major
distributors,
the
difference
in
that
returns
only
became
markedly
apparent
in
those
films
which
gross
nationally
more
than
500,000.
this
is
evident
when
we
see
that
97
of
that
195
pictures
distributed
by
plaintiffs
had
national
rentals
of
less
than
a
$100,000.
indeed,
and
those
pictures
were
reissue
pictures
of
an
antiquity
which
makes
them
almost
part
of
the
folklore
of
the
cinema.
and
then
the
footnote,
such
as
the
following
pictures
which
in
the
four
years
involved
in
this
action
had
the
following
gross
national
revenue,
getting
gertie's
garter,
$17,400.
that
means
from
the
full
distribution
in
the
whole
country.
up
in
mabel's
room,
$17,000,
twin
beds,
15,000
plus,
tillies
romance,
$13,400.
included
in
the
list
were
also
such
pictures
as
capital
queen,
which
had
a
national
gross
in
this
period
of
$2800
and
weaker
sex
which
had
a
national
gross
of
$7300.
in
other
words,
the
findings
in
the
trial
court
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
--
now,
if
you're
remembering
the
dissenting
opinion
of
--
i
don't
want
to
confuse
the
two
judge
clarks
so
when
i
refer
to
judge
clark
here,
i'll
take
the
liberty
of
saying
judge
tom
clark
but
i'm
referring
to
judge
clark
in
the
circuit
court
in
new
york.
in
his
dissenting
opinion
when
you
read
it,
i
can
understand
the
--
one
of
the
questions
asked
of
my
adversary
yesterday,
"was
this
a
trial
on
the
merits
or
was
it
on
summary
judgment?"
because
the
way
you
read
judge
clark's
dissenting
opinion,
you'd
imagine
that
it
was
either
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
at
the
close
of
plaintiff's
case
that
the
--
the
trial
court
had
dismissed.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
no.
let
me
tell
you
about
in
very
few
words.
and
no
doubt
you
refer
to
the
punitive
sentence
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
out
of
judge
clark
--
frank
had
lived
that
he
would
have
gone
along,
decided
the
case
with
judge
clark.
we
argued
the
case
in
november.
judge
frank
died
in
december.
1st
of
february,
we
got
a
letter
from
judge
clark,
and
in
the
letter
he
said
--
well
--
well
the
effect
of
it
was
judge
hincks
and
i
are
not
agreeing
so
we've
appointed
judge
waterman
to
take
judge
frank's
position,
"there
will
be
no
need
for
any
further
argument."
now,
that's
the
story
on
the
--
on
the
--
that
case.
and
anyhow
--
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
neither,
neither
side.
they're
on
a
such
preemptory
shaft
in
the
letter
from
chief
judge
clark
that
i
don't
think
either
of
us
dared
to
ask
for
it
or
argued.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
no,
no,
no,
no.
the
--
the
last
sentence
i
quoted
verbatim
on
that
my
memory
is
clear,
"there
will
be
no
need
for
any
further
argument,
period."
now
--
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
no,
no,
no.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
yes.
well,
i
hope
i
answered
your
curiosity.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
well,
both
of
us
went
along
with
the
direction
of
the
chief
judge
and
then
waited
about,
i
don't
know,
eight
or
nine
months
before
we
got
a
decision.
now,
if
you
recall
in
his
opinion,
he
more
or
less
--
i
mean
you
could
read
it
but
there
was
a
summary
judgment
application
or
dismissal
at
the
close
of
plaintiff's
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
reason
i
say
there
are
no
issues
of
law
here.
judge
dawson
decided
this
case
on
the
facts.
and
if
you
read
his
opinion,
you'll
see
he
not
only
analyzed
the
proof
but
he
analyzed
the
failure
of
proof,
which
i
am
going
to
come
to
right
now
on
what
is
really
completely
wrong
with
plaintiff's
position
factually
in
this
situation.
eagle
lion
called
as
a
two
principal
witnesses,
a
man
named
macmillan.
macmillan
had
been
a
lawyer
in
troy,
new
york
until
he
went
into
the
world
war
ii.
when
he
got
out
of
world
war
ii,
he
went
to
work
for
robert
t.
young
as
editor
or
publisher
of
--
i
--
i
forget
the
name
of
the
publication
but
the
purpose
of
it
is
how
to
run
a
railroad.
and
this
young
man,
macmillan,
worked
on
that
railroad
magazine
until
the
middle
of
1948.
now,
mind
you,
here's
the
eagle-lion
coming
along
in
1946.
in
1948,
he
went
in
as
vice-president,
and
then
that
was
in
june.
he
testified,
"i
know
nothing
about
the
quality
of
pictures.
i
know
nothing
about
the
distribution
of
pictures.
i
have
never
sold
a
picture
or
tried
to
sell
a
picture.
what
i
did
was
in
1950,
after
the
paramount
decree
which
is
in
this
case,
i
went
over
to
the
vice-president
of
rko,
a
man
named
--
was
it
kingsberg
--
malcolm
kingsberg,
and
i
told
mr.
kingsberg
i
didn't
think
we
were
getting
a
fair
shake
on
the
rko
circuit,
and
if
you
don't
treat
us
better,
we're
going
to
sue
you."
that's
macmillan
number
1.
macmillan
number
2
said,
"i
did
the
same
thing
to
moskowitz,
the
vice-president
of
loew."
now,
this
was
1950
just
before
they
went
out
of
business,
merely
to
let
the
rko
circuit
and
the
other
circuit
know
that
they
were
going
to
be
sued.
now,
that's
macmillan.
the
other
principal
witness
--
now,
there
are
two
others
--
gross.
he
was
a
--
a
statistician
who
went
to
work
for
eagle
lion
late
in
1951
after
the
lawsuit
was
started,
and
his
job
was
to
construct
figures
upon
which
they
would
base
their
damage
claims
in
the
lawsuit.
now
here's
witness
number
2.
witness
number
3
was
a
lawyer
from
california
who
was
attorney
for
eagle
lion
out
there,
and
he
was
allowed
to
testify.
judge
dawson
gave
him
the
greatest
latitude
to
every
conversation
with
every
punitive
producer
of
a
motion
picture
on
his
efforts
to
get
production
to
release
through
eagle
lion.
we
objected
to
those,
hearsay,
we
couldn't
examine
any
of
these
alleged
producers.
and
that
is
set
out
in
mr.
mcgovern's
brief
as
great
length
as
their
efforts
to
get
production
for
release.
and
when
i
read
the
brief,
i
took
it
for
granted
that
mr.
mcgovern
was
quoting
from
witnesses
who
actually
testified.
not
one
of
them
testified.
now,
we
come
to
the
second
question
and
this
is
the
most
important
thing
in
the
lawsuit,
from
filure
of
proof.
when
eagle
lion
started,
a
lawyer
named
arthur
krim
was
the
president.
that
was
in
1946.
a
--
a
man
named
al
schwalberg
was
vice-president
in
charge
of
sales
and
distribution.
he
was
succeeded
by
william
heineman
in
1947
late
as
vice-president
in
charge
of
sales
and
distribution.
macmillan's
other
big
testimonies
that
these
two
men
were
in
charge
of
the
sales
and
distribution
but
he
never
mixed
into
it
and
they
were
in
full
charge
of
it.
now,
on
the
time
of
the
trial,
schwalberg,
heineman,
krim,
benjamin
--
benjamin
was
a
member
of
their
board,
chairman
of
the
board
at
one
time
i
believe
but
he's
a
member
of
the
board.
every
one
of
them
were
in
new
york
city,
has
offices
in
new
york
city,
and
judge
dawson
asked
them.
“why
have
--
or
who
was
in
charge
of
these
negotiations
trying
to
sell
pictures
to
leave
the
loew's
or
rko?”
answer,
“heineman
and
schwalberg.”
"well,
why
then
--
why
aren't
they
being
called?
why
aren't
they
witnesses
here?
why
don't
they
come
and
tell
the
court
what
efforts,
if
any,
were
ever
made
to
sell
a
picture
to
either
loew
circuit
or
the
rko
circuit?"
the
answer
given
by
mr.
mcgovern,
"oh,
we
can't
call
mr.
heineman."
this
is
the
questions
put
to
him
by
judge
dawson,
"well,
why
can't
you
call
them?"
"oh,
he
works
for
united
artist."
well
he's
available.
"do
you
mean
to
tell
the
court
that
if
he's
called
he
won't
tell
the
truth?"
mr.
mcgovern's,
"oh
no,
he'll
tell
the
truth."
yet
he
never
called
heineman.
he
never
called
schwalberg.
and
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
there
isn't
one
word
of
proof
that
eagle
lion
ever
tried
to
license
a
single
picture
to
either
rko
or
loew's
wherever
turned
down
on
a
license.
and
then
you
have
the
full
admission
by
macmillan,
the
president,
"we
do
not
claim,"
and
i'll
quote
the
answer.
question,
“and
you
so
testified
on
your
deposition,
you
are
making
no
complaint
against
rko
or
loew's
based
upon
discrimination
against
any
individual
picture
released
by
you?”
answer,
"that
is
correct."
in
--
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
oh,
that
--
that's
on
page
124
of
the
record.
and
judge
whitaker,
go
one
step
further,
you
go
to
the
next
page
of
the
record,
125
and
an
answer
to
mr.
gillespie's
questions
he
makes
the
same
identical
answer,
"we
are
not
claiming
any
discrimination
on
a
single
picture."
now,
your
honors
heard
mr.
mcgovern
yesterday
say
they
are
making
no
claim
against
the
treatment
they
received
on
their
pictures
first
run
in
new
york
city.
out
of
a
hundred
and
--
they
say
a
196
--
there
are
a
195
pictures
in
reality
but
red
shoes
which
i
say
is
the
only
really
great
picture
they
had
even
though
it
was
a
foreign-made
picture.
it
wasn't
treated
as
a
foreign-made
picture
in
this
country.
in
fact,
they
took
the
picture,
rented
the
visual
theater
in
new
york,
a
legitimate
theater
sold
what's
known
in
the
trade
is
five
tickets
in
reserve
seats,
showed
it
twice
a
day,
rented
two
years
and
never
let
one
of
us
get
a
look
at
it.
i
mean
for
--
for
our
theaters
until
that
full
two
years
have
expired
(inaudible).
then
we
were
shown
first
run
at
the
victoria
theater
on
broadway
just
around
the
corner
from
where
they
played
on
the
road
show,
played
there
a
short
engagement
then
we
took
it,
played
it
across
the
circuit,
rko.
everyone
of
our
theaters
gave
him
extended
playing
time,
paid
him
60
odd
thousand
dollars.
and
i
think
one
of
the
exhibit
shows
on
the
full
engagement
we
made
about
$5000
profit,
but
they
did
it
all
right.
that
picture
is
in
twice
sold
a
196
pictures.
now,
out
of
196
--
if
you
look
at
defendant
rko's
exhibit
a
and
all
these
are
taken
from
records,
fairness
does
by
the
statistician
gross.
and
gross
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
tell
your
honors,
he
testified
and
know
nothing
about
the
pictures
were
sold.
i
don't
know
the
quality
if
any
--
all
i
can
(inaudible)
to
see
the
figures.
that's
his
testimony.
now,
out
of
the
196,
24
pictures
received
a
first
run
in
new
york
city.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
it
--
well
all
handed
out
your
honor.
i
--
we
have
them
photostatted
and
a
sent
made
for
each
justice.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
a,
rko-a.
i
think
that
looks
like
--
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
yes.
now,
on
the
second
sheet
--
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
i
think
justice
whitaker
has
--
i
think
they're
in
an
envelope
for
that
character.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
well,
that's
loew.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
no,
rko-a.
i
think
they're
in
a
--
they're
in
there,
i
think
that's
the
folder.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
yes,
yes,
that's
it.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
second
page,
judge
brennan,
you'll
see
those
are
the
pictures
that
they're
able
to
get
a
first
run
and
represented
in
broadway
theaters
and
you
see
they
amount
to
24
pictures
and
they've
been
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
this
setup
by
running
pictures
that
played
in
the
globe
theater
and
paid
frankly
no
film
rental
as
well
as
the
ones
that
played
in
the
better,
that
group
of
theaters.
now,
on
frankly
everyone
of
those
pictures,
they
got
either
a
long
half
or
a
short
half
run
it
on
either
the
rko
or
loew
circuit.
and
the
figures
that
are
reflected
in
the
last
column
are
--
that's
an
arbitrary
figure
set
up
by
taking
all
the
theaters,
that
was
done
by
--
in
that
--
by
the
--
the
petitioners.
they
draw
a
line
down
the
middle
of
the
hudson
river
and
they
ex
--
extended
all
the
way
up
to
tarrytown,
then
in
tarrytown,
they
draw
a
line
across
the
westchester
county.
and
then
they
bring
it
down
through
westchester
and
include
the
five
bars
of
the
city
in
new
york
then
go
up
long
island
sound
as
far
as
where
hicks
really
is.
on
long
island,
they
chopped
it
off
there.
they
take
all
the
theaters
in
that
area
and
they
add
them
to
the
--
to
the
film
rental,
they
got
and
they
call
that
"new
york
metro
rental".
now,
that's
at
the
last
column.
the
first
run
rental
is
on
the
second
column.
the
new
yorkers
changed
rental
is
on
the
other
column
and
you
can
see
from
the
examination,
a
lien,
the
first
run
film
rental
was
in
new
york
city
all
of
it
which
played
on
percentage.
in
fact
you
have
a
picture
like
jackie
robinson
story
which
was
a
very
timely
pictures
when
robinson
was
playing
second
base
for
the
dodgers
and
the
dodgers
were
independent
that
year
and
the
picture
was
released
during
the
ball
season.
the
other
played
at
aster
theater,
no
film
rental,
none
--
during
--
none
on
the
percentage
deal,
yet
we
paid
a
very
substantial
film
rental
to
them
because
we
intelligently
booked
it
in
as
the
evidence
shows
over
the
labor
day
just
before
the
world
series.
and
we
did
a
fine
business
in
the
rko
houses
with
it.
and
i
think
the
witness
testified
and
in
addition,
we
are
blessed
with
rain
on
the
holiday
which
kept
the
people
in
going
to
the
theaters,
so
we
--
it
was
well
done.
now,
there
is
the
situation
and
there
is
the
first
witness
in
their
senate.
they
can't
get
their
pictures
played
first
run
in
the
good
houses.
mr.
downing,
the
head
of
the
music
hall,
was
called
as
a
witness
by
loew's.
he
said
they
--
eagle
lion
asked
him
to
screen
four
pictures.
during
the
whole
time,
he
screened
the
four
but
he
didn't
find
anyone
of
the
four
suitable
to
be
shown
in
the
music
hall,
but
their
product
was
not
music
hall
product.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
art
page
on
the
front,
i
--
i'm
not
disdainful
of
art
theaters.
in
fact,
i'd
personally
gone
on
more
art
theaters
than
i
do
the
regular
theaters.
there
are
single
bills
and
--
and
they're
generally
well-made
artistic
pictures,
and
on
any
of
the
played
pictures
were
any
good
at
all,
they
did
all
right.
they
quartet
the
second
one.
they
claimed
they
got
121,700
film
rental
on
the
first
run
for
sutton
theatre,
new
york.
it's
a
beautiful
film
rental.
then
they
say
in
the
new
york
metro
area
that's
that
imaginary
area
they've
set
up,
they
got
a
173,200.
and
it
goes
down
the
line.
they
had
a
market
for
the
art
pictures
in
the
art
theaters,
you
have
art
theaters
here
in
washington,
they
had
them
in
and
they
do
very
well.
in
new
york,
we
had
more
of
them
than
you
have
in
most
places.
however,
the
big
problem
is
that
the
picture
after
picture
release
by
them
never
saw
the
light
of
day
in
the
first
run
in
new
york
house.and
those
are
the
pictures
that
had
the
trouble
everywhere.
now,
youngstein
was
called
--
what
is
that,
you
mean
five
minutes
or
am
i
through?
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
oh,
i'm
sorry.
well,
i
got
a
lot
more
i'd
love
to
say
but
i
think
the
briefs
cover
it
all.
and
i'm
--
think
this
case
was
decided
on
the
facts
by
judge
dawson.
he's
written
a
beautiful
opinion,
an
analytic
opinion.
he
saw
the
witnesses.
he
saw
their
failure
to
prove
they
haven't
tried
to
reach
our
market,
and
he
has
so
referred
to
it
in
the
--
out
return
on
that
note.
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
well,
i'd
be
very
happy
to
take
off
and
talk
right
on
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
c.
raftery
