mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
antitrust
suit
for
damages
against
the
rko
and
loew
motion
pictures
theatre
circuits
in
new
york
city,
arising
out
of
the
monopolization
in
that
city
of
the
first
neighborhood
run
by
those
two
circuits.
the
petitioners
here
are
four
associated
companies
formally
engaged
in
the
independent
distribution
and
production
of
motion
pictures.
they
produced
those
pictures
during
most
of
the
period
of
time
involved
here
under
the
name
eagle
lion
and
i
shall
refer
them
hereafter
as
eagle
lion.
the
damage
period
involved
are
the
--
is
the
four
playing
seasons
46
to
47
through
49
to
50.
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioners
relied
primarily
upon
the
case
of
the
united
states
v.
paramount
pictures,
et
al.
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
conspiracy
on
behalf
of
the
rko
and
loew's
circuits
to
exclude
independent
distributors
like
ourselves
of
access
--
competitive
access
to
the
first
neighborhood
run
market
in
new
york.
we
were,
of
course,
relying
upon
section
5
of
the
clayton
act
which
makes
a
prior
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
admissible
as
prima
facie
evidence
in
behalf
of
a
private
claimant
as
to
those
matters
as
to
which
there
is
an
estoppel
between
the
government
and
the
defendants
in
the
prior
case.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no,
your
honor,
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
without
a
jury.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
both
side
with
an
evidence
as
the
full
record
here.
both
lower
courts
held
that
the
paramount
judgment
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
conspiracy
against
independent
distributors.
both
courts
below
held
that
if
the
paramount
case
was
evidence
of
any
conspiracy
at
all,
it
was
evidence
only
of
a
conspiracy
against
independent
exhibitors
as
distinct
from
independent
distributors
and
that
therefore
it
established
no
conspiracy
at
all
as
to
ourselves,
independent
distributors.
i
should
like
just
for
a
moment
before
coming
to
the
paramount
judgment
itself
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
market
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the
first
neighborhood
run
market
in
new
york
is
the
most
important
single
market
for
motion
pictures
in
the
world.
from
this
tremendous
concentration
of
population
located
on
manhattan
island
in
the
metropolitan
area
generally,
a
motion
picture
distributor
will
ordinarily
derive
from
9%
to
11%
of
its
total
national
domestic
gross
and
a
percentage
that
large
is
more
often
than
not
the
margin
between
successful
and
unsuccessful
distribution
of
a
motion
picture.
curiously
enough,
the
new
york
--
the
entire
new
york
market
is
a
market
of
very
strange
contrasts.
as
the
members
of
the
court
may
know,
there
are
concentrated
up
on
broadway
in
midtown
manhattan,
all
substantially
fall
of
the
so-called
first
run
new
york
houses.
the
showcases
on
broadway
while
the
--
the
major
defendants
in
the
paramount
case
had
some
affiliated
theatres
on
broadway.
by
and
large,
they
were
35
to
40
independently
operated
theatres
on
broadway.
and
the
plaintiffs
here
were
able
to
get
competitive
access
to
that
first
new
york
run
in
broadway
without
difficulty.
the
record
shows
that
insofar
as
we
have
comparable
classes
of
pictures
getting
access
to
first
run
in
new
york
that
our
pictures
outgrew
theirs
slightly.
we
took
--
as
i
recall,
we
took
.028
of
our
national
gross
out
of
that
first
new
york
run
on
broadway
as
against
.025
for
the
major
distributors
affiliated
with
the
defendants
in
the
paramount
case.
but
as
you
came
off,
first
new
york
run
on
broadway
and
began
to
approach
the
circuits
where
the
great
mass
of
the
consuming
public
in
new
york
in
this
industry
are
located,
you
ran
into
this
blockade
by
these
two
circuits,
the
rko
and
loew's
circuits.
these
two
circuits
together
comprise
approximately
100
theatres
and
these
were
not
only
the
theatres
that
enjoyed
the
first
and
second
neighborhood
run
clearance.
but
they
were
also
the
most
strategically
located
theatres
in
terms
of
the
population
that
they
served.
access
to
those
two
circuits
was
critically
important
to
a
distributor
in
the
new
york
area
for
another
reason,
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
control
of
the
first
and
second
neighborhood
runs,
all
of
the
subsequent
runs
in
new
york
played
off
the
two
preceding
circuit
runs,
second
and
first,
on
the
rko
and
loew
circuits.
and
the
result
of
that
was
that
all
of
the
subsequent
run
house
is
getting
on
down
to
the
third,
fourth
of
the
tag-ins
down
below.
all
had
developed
the
pattern,
the
industry
pattern
of
taking
their
bills
off
the
prior
weekly
bills
on
the
rko
and
loew
circuits.
the
result
of
that,
if
the
court
please,
was
that
in
new
york
where
you
have
in
the
entire
neighborhood
run
area,
everything
at
the
first
broadway,
you
have
about
600
theatre
availabilities
all
told
of
which
only
100
are
concentrated
in
the
two
circuits.
the
result
of
this
playoff
system
was
that
unless
you've
got
in
up
on
top
in
either
the
rko
or
the
loew
circuit,
you
are
blocked
out
not
only
from
the
100
theatres
comprising
the
two
circuits
but
you
were
indeed
blocked
out
from
all
of
the
subsequent
run
theatres
in
new
york.
in
short,
if
you
get
in
the
circuits,
you
were
to
sent
blocked
in
the
600
houses
right
down
the
line.
if
you
are
excluded
from
the
circuits,
you
were
out
of
about
600
houses.
the
result
was
--
is
--
is
apparent
in
the
record
that
the
two
circuits
constituted
a
very
serious
bottleneck
confronting
any
distributor
who
came
in
new
york,
instead
of
having
600
available
buyers
that
only
might
go
for
the
competitive
selection
of
these
pictures
on
a
give-and-take
basis
based
upon
quality
and
play
date
and
so
forth.
where
an
independent
like
ourself
came
to
new
york,
we
had
two
choices.
we
could
go
to
the
rko
booking
office
and
try
to
book
the
rko
circuit
in
which
case
would
made
rko
and
all
the
theatres
following
thereafter
or
we
could
go
to
the
loew
booking
office
and
try
to
book
the
loew
circuit.
and
if
we
got
in,
good,
and
if
we
didn't,
we
were
out.
in
short,
what
you
had
here
was
really
two
buyers
and
this
critically
important
neighborhood
run
market
in
new
york.
now,
it
wasn't
recognition
of
that
kind
of
circuit
buying
power
and
the
power
of
the
circuit
to
exclude
independents,
both
distributors
and
exhibitors
that
the
three-judge
court
in
the
paramount
case
found
that
the
conspiracy
that
was
castigated
there
operated
both
on
independent
distributors
and
independent
exhibitors.
those
findings
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
independent
distributors
as
well
as
the
exhibitors
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
9
and
10.
and
i
will
not
go
into
them
in
detail
here.
suffice
it
to
say
that
on
the
basis
of
those
findings,
the
three-judge
court
in
the
paramount
case
concluded
the
--
in
conclusion
number
nine
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
643,
concluded
as
follows
and
i
quote,
“the
exhibitor-defendant
loew's
inc.,
warner
brothers
pictures,
warner
brothers
circuit
management
corporation,
twentieth
century-fox
et
al,
all
of
the
majors,
have
unreasonably
restrained
trade
and
commerce
in
the
distribution
and
exhibition
of
motion
pictures.”
and
i
emphasize,
your
honor,
merely
because
of
the
nature
of
the
decisions
below,
“restrained
trading
commerce
in
the
distribution
and
exhibition
of
motion
pictures”.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
that
appears

--
justice
douglas
at
643.
that's
conclusion
number
9.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
the
findings
and
conclusions
in
the
paramount
case
were
never
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
right,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes.
the
three
--
you're
talking
about
paramount
court?
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes.
i
might
just
stop
a
moment
to
trace
the
history
there.
you
had
a
three-judge
expediting
court
convened
by
the
--
by
the
government
to
try
the
case
to
begin
with.
that
court
first
handed
out
its
decision
in
1946.
that
decision
was
reversed
in
part,
affirmed
in
part
by
this
court
reversed
particularly
with
those
aspects
looking
toward
the
(inaudible)
relief.
the
case
then
went
back.
there
were
hearings
on
remand
in
new
york
by
the
three-judge
court
in
1948
and
the
final
decision
came
out
in
october
of
1949
and
the
final
judgment
which
we
--
which
is
now
before
us,
we
printed
it
up
in
the
record.
the
final
judgment
appeared
in
february
of
1950.
now,
the
defendants
make
a
--
still
make
a
half-hearted
contention
in
this
court,
i
believe,
that
the
paramount
case
is
applicable
only
to
exhibitors
and
does
not
affect
distributors.
i
suggest
however
that
we
have
reached
this
point
here
thoroughly.
i
merely
wish
to
emphasize
before
i
leave
it
that
the
paramount
case
in
so
many
words,
we
needn't
argue
implicitly,
explicitly
on
the
face
of
the
judgment
repeatedly.
the
three-judge
court
in
paramount
found
a
discrimination
and
a
monopolization
against
independent
distributors
as
well
as
independent
exhibitors.
and
i
should
like
also,
your
honors,
to
emphasize
this
point,
that
when
the
court
in
paramount
is
referring
to
the
operation
of
the
conspiracy
there
upon
independent
distributors,
they
are
referring
to
the
petitioners
here
among
others
because
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
that
case,
they
were
only
three
independent
distributors
in
the
country,
eagle
lion,
monogram
and
republic.
and
we
appeared
in
both
the
original
case
and
on
the
hearings
on
remand
in
1948,
eagle
lion
appeared
as
a
witness
for
the
government
and
gave
testimony
in
behalf
of
the
government.
there
are
findings
of
fact
in
that
judgment
referring
to
the
revenues
received
by
eagle
lion
as
well
as
the
other
independent
distributors.
and
so
i
emphasize
that
not
only
do
you
have
in
the
paramount
case
findings
referring
to
independent
distributors
as
a
group
but
you
have
findings
that,
i
think,
at
all
experience,
must
be
construed
as
referring
to
these
petitioners
here
to
eagle
lion
because
we
were
one
of
the
parties
before
the
court
in
that
case.
so
much
for
the
national
conspiracy
and
the
findings
relating
to
it
found
in
the
paramount
case.
coming
down
to
this
very
market
here
this
new
york
subsequent
run
market,
the
court
in
paramount
in
its
final
judgment
in
1950
made
this
finding,
finding
154
(d)
which
i
think
is
critical
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
that
appears
on
the
record
at
pages
636
to
637.
finding
154
(d)
reads,
“in
new
york
city,
loew
and
rko
divided
the
neighborhood
prior
run
product
of
the
various
dependent
distributors
under
a
continuing
arrangement
so
that
there
was
no
competition
between
them
in
obtaining
pictures.
on
one
occasion
where
paramount
was
having
a
long
dispute
with
loew's
as
to
rental
terms
for
paramount
films
to
be
shown
in
loew's
new
york
neighborhood
circuit
of
theatres,
no
attempt
was
made
by
paramount
to
lease
its
films
to
rko
for
exhibition
in
the
latter
circuit
nor
was
any
effort
made
by
rko
to
procure
paramount
films
as
they
both
evidently
preferred
to
adhere
to
the
existing
arrangement
under
which
loew's
circuit
consistently
exhibited
the
films
of
itself,
paramount,
united
artist,
columbia
and
half
of
universal
while
rko
exhibited
the
films
of
itself,
fox,
warner
and
one
half
of
universal.
in
other
words,
they
carry
the
split
to
the
point
where
they
took
the
universal
product
and
cut
it
in
half
and
each
of
them
took
half
of
it.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
finding,
the
court
in
paramount
made
this
conclusion,
conclusion
16
which
appears
in
the
record
of
page
644.
“loew's
incorporated
has
violated
the
sherman
act
by
conspiring
with
rko
to
monopolize
and
monopolizing
the
first
neighborhood
run
in
new
york
city
and
by
the
dividing
of
that
market
between
itself
and
rko.
now,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
findings
which
have
particular
focus
on
the
very
market
we're
dealing
with
in
this
lawsuit,
the
first
neighborhood
run
in
new
york.
you
have
a
finding
that
the
defendants
have
so
organized
that
market
by
controlling
the
theatres
and
the
division
of
the
product
of
the
other
major
distributors,
that
there
is
no
competition
between
them
in
procuring
films.
we
have
a
conclusion
that
they
have
violated
the
sherman
act
by
monopolizing
that
market
and
by
dividing
the
market
between
them.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
again,
if
the
court
please,
that
those
two
findings
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
judgment
in
february
1950.
in
other
words,
they
were
based
partially
upon
the
hearings
on
remand
in
1948.
they
did
not
appear
in
the
original
judgment
in
1946.
the
judgment
entered
in
1950,
however,
pointed
out
that
it
was
made
as
of
1945
because
that
was
the
time
most
of
the
testimony
in
the
record
had
been
received.
however,
finding
158
in
the
1950
judgment
contains
this
finding.
evidence
submitted
since
the
remand
of
this
case
has
been
considered
by
this
court.
such
evidence
has
been
used
by
the
court
in
making
its
findings
as
to
the
situation
in
1945.
the
change
in
status
and
practices
since
1945
revealed
by
this
evidence
has
been
insufficient
to
warrant
a
change
in
the
findings
and
judgment
entered
herein.
in
addition
to
introducing
the
judgment
itself,
we
also
undertook
by
independent
evidence
before
the
judgment
to
bring
the
judgment
and
ascend
down
to
date
ourselves
and
this
we
did
by
proving
that
the
same
monopolization
of
theatres
in
terms
of
numbers
and
locations
of
theatres
and
runs
continued
right
down
from
1946
down
through
1950.
and
we
also
show
that
the
split
of
the
majors'
product
even
down
to
the
split
of
universal
right
in
half
also
continued
down
from
1945
right
through
1950.
i
think
therefore,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
is
one
of
the
few
cases
where
there's
no
argument
that
the
paramount
judgment
blankets
the
case.
if
it
is
inapplicable
to
this
case,
then
it
was
never
applicable
at
any
case.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
don't
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
don't
think
they
make
any
point
about
that.
i
just
--
i
don't
think
they
do.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
but
i
want
to
be
prepared,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
not
on
this
point
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
don't
think
either
the
lower
courts
took
the
position
of
the
paramount
judgement.
it
was
not
applicable
at
the
point
of
time.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
you
see,
point
of
time.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
here.
and
i
have
this
problem
that
the
1950
judgment
does
recite
the
fact,
that
is,
as
of
1945
although
the
rehearings
on
remand
in
1948
and
this
--
these
findings
i'm
relying
on
here,
finding
154
and
conclusion
16
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
1950
judgement.
they
were
not
in
the
earlier
judgment.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
should
limit
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
to
say,
there
was
no
argument,
i
think,
that
is
blank
but
at
least
temporarily
if
it's
applicable
at
all.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
right.
i
agree.
now,
let
us
come
back,
if
we
may,
just
briefly,
to
what
the
court
found
in
finding
154
(d).
the
court
there
found,
“in
new
york
city,
loew
and
rko
divided
the
neighborhood
run
product
of
the
various
defendant
distributors
under
a
continuing
arrangement
so
that
there
was
no
competition
between
them
in
obtaining
pictures.”
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
think
it
relates
to
their
status
as
to
the
exhibitor
quite
clearly,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
because
the
rko
and
loew
circuit
are
theatre
circuits.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
was
a
distributor.
that's
right.
i
came
into
new
york.
i
tried
to
distribute
my
pictures
in
open
competition
with
the
product
of
the
major
distributors.
i
found
these
two
circuits
set
right
at
fort.
the
whole
new
york
neighborhood
run
market
and
because
of
their
monopolization
of
that
market
and
the
division
of
the
major
distributors
product
between
them,
the
court
here
finds
that
there
was
no
competition
between
the
rko
and
loew's
circuit
in
obtaining
pictures
for
the
theatres.
and
i
said
there
can
be
nothing
except
that
there
was
no
competition
available
to
me
at
the
market
when
i
came
into
town
as
an
independent
trying
to
sell
pictures
in
those
very
theatres.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
various
entire
periods,
mr.
justice
clark.
we
started
distributing
in
1943,
the
period
involved
here
is
1946
to
1950.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
precisely,
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
the
one
or
two
moments
that
remain,
just
let
me
point
this
out.
both
lower
courts
point
out
that
the
pretrial
order
in
this
case
had
one
critical
issue
whether
or
not
eagle
lion
had
been
denied
competitive
access
to
the
rko
and
loew's
circuit
in
consequent
of
the
neighborhood
runs
in
new
york
whether
we
have
been
denied
competitive
access.
now,
keep
in
mind,
conclusion
number
16
of
the
court
said
that
loew's
incorporated
has
violated
the
sherman
act
by
conspiring
with
rko
to
monopolize
and
by
monopolizing
the
first
neighborhood
run
in
new
york
city.
in
our
judgment,
a
monopolization
of
the
market
we
are
seeking
to
enter
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
a
finding
that
we
were
not
denied
competitive
access
to
that
market.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
certainly
--
certainly
our
evidence
was
--
i
--
i
just
don't
really
know
the
answer.
i
never
have
tried
to
evaluate
the
record
in
that
way,
mr.
justice
harlan.
certainly,
all
of
our
evidence
was
key
to
the
assumption
of
the
paramount
judge
and
was
of
course
admissible
at
least
as
prima
facie
evidence.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
whether
or
not,
as
i
pointed
it
out
to
you,
our
own
independent
evidence
bringing
it
down
from
the
period
1945
through
1950,
withstanding
alone,
authorized
the
kind
of
complex
findings
that
were
made
in
the
1950
judgment.
i
just
don't
know.
if
you'll
recall,
the
government
carried
that
case
on
for
a
period
of
close
to
10
years
before
they
succeeded
in
proving
it.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
could
discharge
that
kind
of
a
burden
if
it
were
imposed
upon
us.
now,
the
district
court
escaped
or
sought
to
escape,
but,
i
think,
it's
the
clear
impact
of
finding
154
(d)
which
your
honors
will
recall
held
that
there
was
no
competition
between
them,
in
other
words,
between
rko
and
loew
in
obtaining
pictures.
the
district
court
escaped
the
impact
of
that
by
adding
two,
by
amending
that
finding
of
the
district
court
and
make
it
read,
“no
competition
between
them
in
obtaining
pictures
from
the
defendant
distributors.”
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
well,
i
say,
your
honor,
that
the
basic
--
i'd
like
to
leave
with
the
court
and
to
remind
over
and
i
--
is
simply
that
i
myself
do
not
see
how
you
can
consistently
with
a
finding
of
monopolization
of
a
market
hold
that
we
were
not
at
least
denied
competitive
access
to
that
market.
the
two
of
them
were
inconsistent.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
at
the
close
of
the
argument
on
monday,
we
had
observed
that
the
three-judge
court
in
the
paramount
case
had
found
that
rko
and
loew's
circuits
in
new
york
had
monopolized
the
first
neighborhood
run
in
that
city
and
had
divided
that
market
so
that
there
was
no
competition
between
them
in
obtaining
pictures
for
their
theaters.
we
had
also
noted
that
that
finding
as
to
new
york
was
not
made
in
installation
but
rather
in
the
context
of
the
findings
as
to
the
overall
nationwide
monopolization
found
in
the
paramount
case.
in
other
words,
the
court
in
the
paramount
case
found
an
interdependency
between
the
respective
defendants.
so
that
you
had
in
a
sense
a
back-scratching
situation
created.
in
other
words,
rko
and
loew
happen
to
have
the
theater
monopolization
in
new
york.
but
paramount
had
it
in
chicago
and
fox
had
it
on
the
west
coast.
and
quite
clearly,
if
rko
and
loew
wished
to
get
reciprocal
preferential
treatment
in
chicago
and
in
los
angeles,
they
had
an
obligation
in
new
york
where
they
control
the
circuit
theaters
to
take
care
of
their
co-conspirator
defendants.
we
had
concluded
on
monday
as
the
court
may
recall
by
noting
that
the
main
issue
or
one
of
the
main
issues
in
this
case
was
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
the
record
at
page
692,
one
of
the
issues
set
up
in
the
pretrial
order
was,
"did
the
defendants
combine
and
conspire
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states
to
exclude
the
plaintiffs
from
the
opportunity
of
licensing
on
a
competitive
basis
their
feature
motion
pictures
to
loew
and
rko
theaters
which
exhibit
feature
motion
pictures
in
the
new
york
metropolitan
area
on
runs
subsequent
to
first
broadway?"
in
other
words,
the
primary
and
first
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
or
not
the
two
defendants
here
had
conspired
to
deny
independent
distributors
like
eagle
lion
the
opportunity
of
licensing
on
a
competitive
basis
their
feature
motion
pictures.
and
we
ended
on
monday
by
noting
as
far
as
the
petitions
are
concerned
that
in
our
judgment,
there's
a
fundamental
inconsistency
between
a
finding
such
as
you
have
in
the
paramount
case
that
rko
and
loew
monopolized
the
first
neighborhood
run
in
new
york
and
a
finding
that
the
independent
such
as
ourselves
were
still
free
to
license
our
product
to
those
two
circuits
on
a
competitive
basis.
now,
we
suggest
further,
if
the
court
please,
that
any
possible
doubt
about
the
invidious
impact
of
that
kind
of
a
monopolization
upon
an
independent
like
ourselves
is
resolved
when
we
stop
to
consider
the
manner
in
which
the
two
monopolist
undertook
to
implement
their
monopoly
power.
in
other
words,
when
we
stop
to
consider
the
mechanics
whereby
they
operated
these
two
circuits.
the
fact
is
that
during
the
four
years
involved
here,
the
two
circuits
pursue
a
playing
policy
in
the
administration
of
their
monopoly
power
that
necessarily
had
the
effect
of
curtailing
that
market,
that
tremendously
important
first
neighborhood
market
in
new
york.
so
that
it
not
only
could
not
accommodate
pictures
by
independents
like
ourselves,
but
there
wasn't
even
enough
preferential
playing
time
to
accommodate
the
pictures
of
their
own
assigned
co-conspirators.
now,
that
situation
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
two
circuits
had
broken
the
week
down
into
an
arbitrary
long
half
composed
of
five
or
six
days
as
they
saw
fit
and
a
so-called
short
half
composed
of
one
or
two
days.
the
long
half,
as
the
court
will
appreciate,
was
really
the
line
share
of
the
long
half,
five
or
six
days.
they
played
a
double
bill
on
both
half,
the
long
half
and
the
short
half.
but
only
the
so-called
top
feature
picture
on
the
long
half
of
the
week
was
allowed
to
earn
a
percentage
of
gross
rental.
and
this
was
really
the
only
desirable
rental
position
on
the
entire
circuit
play.
that
top
feature
on
the
long
half
was
granted
a
percentage
of
gross
as
its
rental.
the
second
feature
on
the
long
half
and
these
two
features
over
on
the
short
half
were
all
paid
an
arbitrary
flat
rental
which
was
much
less
desirable
as
both
courts
below
found.
so
that,
you
had
a
situation,
if
the
court
please,
where
the
100
or
more
theaters
comprising
the
two
circuits
plus
the
600
theaters
in
the
subsequent
runs
have
played
off
these
two
circuits.
all
of
those
theaters
were
confined
to
utilizing
only
52
pictures
in
each
circuit
in
that
top
feature
position,
on
the
preferential
rental
term,
only
52
feature
pictures
per
year.
in
other
words,
the
two
circuits
taken
together
could
only
consume
a
104
pictures
per
year.
and
this
during
a
period
of
time
when
their
own
assigned
co-conspiring
distributors
were
producing
250
pictures
per
year.
even
if
you
took
both
of
these
positions
on
the
--
on
the
long
half,
the
top
feature
and
the
second
feature,
the
flat
rental
picture,
you
still
only
had
a
104
pictures
there,
a
104
pictures
on
the
other
circuit,
208
is
the
total.
and
again,
during
a
period
of
time
when
the
co-conspiring
distributors
were
themselves
producing
250
pictures
per
year.
now,
we
suggest
that
--
that
sort
of
a
playing
policy
tends
to
make
graphically
explicit,
what
we
think
is
perfectly
explicit
on
the
face
of
the
paramount
judgement
anyway
and
that
is
that
the
circuits
did
not
have
enough
time
to
accommodate
properly
their
own
codefendants
much
less
have
anytime
left
over
for
independence
like
ourselves.
at
best,
it
seems
to
us
perfectly
obvious
that
the
most
that
remain
for
an
independent
distributor
like
eagle
lion
was
the
marginable
playing
time
if
any
that
worked
out
in
the
course
of
the
year.
in
other
words,
we
got
the
crumbs
that
fell
from
the
board
if
any
there
were
and
we
didn't
get
many
crumbs.
indeed,
in
the
four
years
involved
here,
we
succeeded
in
placing
only
eight
of
our
--
196
pictures
in
either
one
of
those
top
feature
positions
on
either
the
loew
or
the
rko
circuit.
so,
we
contend
that
quite
apart
from
the
paramount
case
itself
that
the
playing
policy
pursued
by
these
two
circuits
to
implement
the
monopoly
power
that
is
implicit
on
the
face
of
the
paramount
decision
necessarily
resulted
in
such
as
a
narrowly,
a
severely
narrowed
market
for
independents
like
ourselves
that
you
have
not
only
liability
on
the
antitrust
laws
but
you
have
clearly
the
fact
of
injury
to
ourselves
because
we
have
compelled
to
sell
not
only
in
a
noncompetitive
market,
but
we
were
compelled
to
sell
in
a
market
that
was
deliberately
and
so
arbitrarily
narrowed
that
from
the
operation
of
the
conspiracy
itself.
it
was
clear
that
there
was
little
of
any
playing
time
for
the
independents.
now,
that
being
the
case,
if
the
court
please,
we
come
to
the
question
of
how
appropriately
to
measure
the
impact
on
us,
an
independent
distributor
of
that
conspiracy.
in
the
bigelow
case,
bigelow
versus
rko,
327
u.s.,
this
court
many
years
ago
restated
the
wrongdoer
rule.
that
is
the
principle
that
once
an
antitrust
violation
is
established,
the
risk
and
the
jeopardy
of
determining
with
certainty
or
uncertainty
as
the
case
maybe
the
impact
of
that
conspiracy
upon
the
victim
of
the
conspiracy,
the
risk
in
jeopardy
of
trying
to
evaluate
that
impact
is
cast
not
upon
the
victim,
but
upon
the
wrongdoer.
this
court
speaking
to
mr.
chief
justice
stone
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
there
said,
and
i
quote
from
page
265,
“the
wrongdoer
may
not
object
to
the
plaintiff's
reasonable
estimate
of
the
cause
of
injury
and
of
its
amount
because
it's
not
based
on
more
accurate
data
which
the
wrongdoer's
misconduct
has
rendered
unavailable”.
of
course,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
i
think
to
all
of
us
that
after
a
monopolization,
it
is
never
possible
to
go
back
and
attempt
to
recreate
what
competitive
conditions
might
have
produced
in
terms
of
the
victims
performance.
all
you
can
do
is,
i
think,
do
what
the
chief
--
the
former
chief
justice
of
this
court
indicated
in
the
bigelow
case
and
that
is,
undertake
in
the
area
of
the
violation
in
the
market
allegedly
monopolized,
undertake
to
compare
the
performance
of
your
product
with
the
performance
of
the
conspirator's
product
and
the
difference,
if
any
there
be,
is
the
measure
of
your
damage.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
it
is
applicable
because
i
think
that
we
find
ourselves
standing
before
the
court
today
precisely
the
same
posture
as
the
petitioner
in
the
bigelow
case.
the
bigelow
case,
it
is
true,
was
a
jury
verdict
in
the
district
court
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
we
have,
i
think,
the
right
under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act
to
claim
the
benefit
here
of
the
same
kind
of
a
finding.
we
have
a
finding
by
the
three-judge
court
in
paramount
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
this
market.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
know,
but
i'm
talking
about
bigelow
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
point
i
think
of
the
bigelow
case
was
this,
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed
there
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
sufficient
to
prove
its
certainty
the
unlawful
conspiracy
to
injure,
that
that
was
not
sufficient
that
you
could
not
go
directly
from
that
over
to
an
estimate
of
your
damage,
but
you
must
go
through
a
third
step
in
the
middle.
you
must
prove
the
impact
of
the
injury
on
you
with
certainty.
and
this
i
think,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
stone
answered
by
saying
that
when
you
prove
a
conspiracy
to
injure
you
or
people
of
your
class,
you
may
then
make
a
reasonable
estimate
of
the
impact
on
you
and
of
the
amount
of
the
impact.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes.
i'm
sure
you
--
i'm
sure
you
do.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i'm
sure
you
do,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
quite
agree
with
you
and
i
don't
believe
in
all
fairness
that
i
am
trying
to
make
a
case
go
beyond
what
it
does.
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
you
are
articulating
here
the
views
you
set
forth
in
the
dissent
in
that
case.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
no
controversy
as
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
well,
but
isn't
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
say
as
i
(voice
overlap)
--
i
am
--
i
think
we
do.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
--
i
say
that
under
the
yardstick
approved
by
the
majority
in
the
bigelow
case,
we
were
entitled
to
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
yes,
and
mr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
it's
binding
on
me
too,
the
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
as
a
counsel
of
this
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
--
this
bar.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
appreciate
your
position.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
we
suggest
that
the
yardstick
approved
by
the
majority
view
in
the
bigelow
case
undertakes
to
state
that
when
you
have
shown
a
conspiracy,
when
you
have
proven
the
violation
of
the
law,
you
may
then
proceed
to
compare
the
performance
of
your
product
in
the
monopolized
or
wronged
marketplace
with
the
performance
of
the
conspirator
or
monopolist's
product
and
that
the
result
is
the
best
available
estimate
of
what
the
damage
to
you
has
been.
it
might
well
be
that
taking
that
yardstick
from
bigelow
and
applying
it
to
our
circumstances
here,
we
could
have
taken
just
a
straight
absolute
comparison
of
our
own
performance
in
new
york
and
undertake
to
compare
it
with
their
performance
in
new
york.
this
is
the
yardstick
that
was
approved
for
mrs.
bigelow's
theater
in
the
bigelow
case.
however,
we
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
because
we
were
comparative
newcomers
to
this
industry,
we
haven't
started
to
distribute
until
1943
that
there
was
a
significant
difference
in
the
size
and
the
established
character
of
their
business
and
ours.
and
we
tried
to
make
a
fair
and
i
think
generous
allowance
for
that
fact.
in
the
measure
of
damage
that
we
put
forth
in
the
court's
below,
instead
of
undertaking
to
make
an
absolute
comparison
between
our
respective
gross
rentals
out
of
the
new
york
area,
we
undertook
to
strike
a
relative
comparison
between
our
performance
in
new
york
in
terms
of
our
own
national
gross
rentals
and
their
performance
in
new
york
in
terms
of
their
national
gross
rentals.
in
other
words,
we
produced
a
ratio
in
which
we
took
the
national
gross
rentals
of
ourselves
and
of
the
defendant
and
co-conspiring
defendants.
we
took
our
own
performance
in
new
york
and
related
it
to
our
own
national
gross.
we
took
their
performance
in
new
york
and
related
it
to
their
national
gross.
we
did
not
relate
our
performance
in
new
york
to
their
national
gross,
we
related
it
to
our
own.
and
i
suggest
that
that
kind
of
a
ratio
have
the
effect
of
discounting
at
the
outset
whatever
substantial
differences
there
might
have
been
in
our
business
--
our
overall
business
and
theirs
because
of
the
older
and
better-established
character
of
their
business.
the
result
of
that
kind
of
a
comparison
was
that
the
record
shows,
and
i
think
at
least
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
data,
there
is
not
much
argument.
the
record
shows
that
we
took
6.4%
of
our
national
gross
out
of
new
york
whereas
the
majors
took
8.9%
of
their
national
gross
out
of
new
york.
in
other
words,
from
that
comparison,
it
appeared
that
eagle
lion
have
received
approximately
40%
less
of
our
national
gross
in
the
new
york
market
then
had
the
defendants.
the
difference
when
applied
to
our
own
national
gross
produced
a
figure
in
terms
of
net
loss
rentals
to
ourselves
of
$417,000.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
well,
the
district
court,
we
think,
made
no
findings
at
all
as
to
the
quality
of
our
pictures
if
you
will
give
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
paramount
decision.
you
see,
the
district
court's
finding
at
the
end,
if
that's
what
your
honor
has
referenced
to,
starts
out
with
the
proposition
assuming
such
a
conspiracy.
now,
our
position
here
quite
simply
is
this,
that
if
you
assume
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
first
neighborhood
run
in
new
york,
then
by
definition,
you
are
assuming
a
conspiracy
to
deny
us
all
competitive
access
to
that
market.
and
i
say
from
that
assumption,
if
that
was
the
assumption
the
district
court
was
genuinely
making,
i
think
quite
clearly,
it
was
not.
but
from
that
assumption,
if
you
make
it,
necessarily
flows
injury
to
us.
i
see
no
way
of
avoiding
this.
and
i'm
saying
that
if
that
assumption
is
made,
in
other
words,
if
we
are
given
the
benefit
of
all
reasonable
inferences
in
the
paramount
judgment
under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act,
then
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
bigelow
rule
takes
up
precisely
where
the
paramount
judgment
leaves
off.
and
the
bigelow
rule
commands
us
to
compare
our
performance
in
that
monopolized
market
with
their
performance.
and
i
don't
think
the
result
of
the
defendants
or
indeed
the
district
court
or
the
circuit
court
to
say,
“well,
but
it's
true
there
was
a
monopoly,
we
assume
that,
but
we
do
not
know
whether
you
would
have
been
better
or
worse
off
if
you
had
a
competition.”
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
an
irrational
test
that
was
rejected
by
the
majority
of
this
court
in
the
bigelow
case
in
our
judgment.
so
i
say
that
from
the
comparative
performance
data
which
we
put
on
the
record,
it
appears
that
there
was
a
difference
in
our
net
rentals
taken
out
of
new
york,
a
relative
difference.
not
absolute,
a
relative
difference
in
our
net
rentals
of
$417,000.
we
finally
gave
up
the
struggle
in
1950
and
sold
eagle
lion
to
united
artists
which
is
the
--
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
paramount
case
and
is
one
of
the
co-conspirators
here.
i
think
again,
there
was
no
argument
that
on
that
sale
to
united
artists,
we
suffered
a
loss,
it's
a
sheer
out-of-pocket
liquidating
loss,
quite
apart
from
loss
of
profits,
just
an
out-of-pocket
liquidating
loss
and
cancellation
of
leases,
on
regional
officers
and
so
forth
of
$146,000.
now,
it
is
perfectly
true
as
it's
been
suggested
from
the
bench
that
the
district
court
engaged
in
some
speculation
as
to
whether
or
not
we
--
we're
not
trying
to
sell
buicks
or
cheap
purse
in
what
it
please
to
style
the
cadillac
in
mink
market
in
new
york.
we
think
that
to
indulge
in
that
kind
of
speculation
is
to
do
the
very
thing
that
i
understand
at
least
the
majority
of
this
court
in
bigelow
said
you
were
protected
from
by
the
wrongdoer
rule.
in
other
words,
the
jeopardy
and
the
risk
of
that
kind
of
a
speculation
is
cast
upon
the
wrongdoer,
not
upon
the
victim.
but
in
any
case,
if
the
court
please,
the
record
here
shows
pretty
conclusively
that
we
weren't
selling
buicks
in
the
cadillac
market
any
more
than
they
were
selling
buicks
in
the
cadillac
market.
the
truth
of
the
matter
of
course
is
that
we
both
had
cadillacs,
we
both
had
buicks.
and
furthermore,
and
this
is
an
important
point
that
i
wish
to
emphasize.
the
conspiracy
here
was
never
conceived
to
operate
and
didn't
really
operate
upon
the
cadillacs.
the
cadillacs,
the
mink
coats,
these
will
sell
themselves
in
any
market.
our
red
shoes,
for
example,
found
access
to
the
circuits
without
much
difficulty
just
like
the
best
years
of
our
lives
distributed
by
the
defendants
did.
it
was
when
we
came
to
the
mediocre
pictures,
the
run-of-the-mill
pictures,
the
typical
product
of
hollywood,
that
--
that
captive
market
of
the
defendants
really
paid
off
handsome
dividends
because
it's
on
these
run-of-the-mill
mediocre
pictures
that
they
undertook
to
give
their
own
product
and
that
is,
they're
assigning
co-conspirators
the
full
circuit
treatment
right
through
and
they
undertook
to
tell
us,
“go
away,
we
don't
wish
your
pictures.”
now,
we
think
that
nothing
in
the
record
here
demonstrates
what
happened
to
us
in
new
york
more
rapidly
than
a
chart
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
702
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
and
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
should
like
to
turn
just
briefly
to
that
chart.
at
page
702
of
the
record,
your
honors
will
note
that
the
court
has
broken
out
in
three
categories
the
way
the
pictures
play
on
the
two
circuits,
the
rko
and
loew's
circuits.
your
honors
will
note
that
on
that
long
half
of
the
week
that
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago,
where
in
the
top
feature
alone
you
could
hope
to
earn
yourself
a
desirable
percentage
of
gross
rent
--
gross
box
office
receipts
as
a
rental
that
our
pictures
were
paid
--
on
that
position,
were
paid
an
average
of
$55,200.
their
pictures
in
that
same
category
were
paid
$97,500.
and
please
bear
in
mind,
if
the
court
please,
that
these
categories
are
not
our
categories.
we
didn't
manufacture
them.
these
are
the
defendant's
own
categories.
and
the
fact
that
they
put
eight
of
our
pictures
in
there,
presumably
reflects
the
fact
that
in
their
arbitrary
judgment
for
whatever
it
was
worth,
our
pictures
merited
that
playing
position.
and
yet
you
will
note,
that
we
get
50%
less
as
a
rental
on
the
average
than
do
the
product
of
the
majors.
let
me
emphasize
also
that
only
eight
eagle
lion
pictures
out
of
196
ever
got
admitted
to
that
top
desirable
rental
position.
when
you
come
down
to
the
next
category,
and
that's
the
long
half
second
position,
paying
a
flat
rental,
they
got
an
average
of
$15,300,
we
got
an
average
of
$15,200.
and
on
the
face
of
it,
that
would
appear
to
indicate
that
we
did
incredibly
as
well
as
they
did
in
terms
of
the
rentals
we
got
from
the
circuits.
they
make
quite
a
point
of
that
by
pointing
out
that
on
the
whole
new
york
situation
in
that
second
--
in
that
long
half
second
category,
we
really
did
a
little
better
than
they
did.
the
truth
of
the
matter
though
is
that
the
reason
why
our
figures
appear
to
be
roughly
equal
in
that
long
half
second
category
is
the
fact
that
they
took
many
of
our
pictures
that
in
our
judgment
were
entitled
to
top
feature
position.
and
they
told
us
in
effect
that,
“look,
if
you
wish
that
picture
played
at
all,
you're
going
to
play
it
as
a
second
feature
in
the
long
half
of
the
week.”
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
there
is
evidence
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
there
is
one
beautiful
example
of
it
in
a
case
with
a
picture
called,
"the
noose
hangs
high,"
starring
abbott
and
costello.
abbott
and
costello
pictures
are
pretty
much
run-of-the-mill
pictures,
but
customarily
by
producing
in
new
york,
they
had
always
played
the
top
feature
position.
indeed,
the
year
before
we
came
by
with
one
same
feature,
same
star,
same
producer,
the
year
before
we
came
by,
universal
brought
them
through
new
york
and,
of
course,
we've
got
the
top
feature
long
half
performance
treatment.
it
was
paid
$78,000.
and
that,
despite
the
fact
it
did
have
no
broadway
first
run
at
all,
we
come
by
a
year
later
with
an
abbot
and
costello
after
having
had
a
satisfactory
first
run
on
broadway
and
earning
a
rental.
and
they
say
to
us,
“you
know,
the
public
is
sick
and
tired
of
abbott
and
costello,
so
you
go
second
feature.”
now,
where
normally
they
would
have
paid
us
--
paid
us
12
--
$7,000
to
$12,000
second
feature.
i
think
they
gave
us
in
this
case
what
i
would
call
"conscience
money".
they
said,
“look,
your
second
feature,
flat
rental,
but
we'll
give
you
$22,500.”
still
$56,000
less
than
they
paid
universal,
one
of
the
assigned
coconspi
--
co-conspiring
distributors
for
the
same
type
of
picture
just
a
few
months
earlier.
so
i'm
saying
that
the
reason
why
this
apparent
parity
exist
in
this
long
half
second
position
is
the
fact
that
we
have
many
pictures
in
there,
that
in
our
judgment,
in
a
competitive
market,
would
have
played
top
feature
and
that
entitled
to
earn
a
percentage
of
the
box
office
receipts,
whatever
they
were
justified
in
terms
of
the
competitor
drawing
power
to
new
york
audiences.
but
as
your
honors
will
note,
the
short
half
which
is
where
much
of
the
damage
to
us
was
really
done.
this
is
where
you'll
get
down
to
the
run-of-the-mill
pictures,
the
mediocre
pictures
and
we
had
them
and
they
had
them,
we
had
reissues
and
they
had
reissues,
we
had
westerns
and
they
had
westerns.
if
we
had
a
picture
called
“up
in
gertie's
room”
to
which
the
district
court
referred,
they
had
a
picture
called
boston
blackie
over
in
new
york.
we
were
typically
buried
in
that
respect.
and
yet
you
will
note
on
those
pictures
in
which
category
incidentally
played
53
of
the
eagle
lion
pictures.
in
other
words,
the
vast
majority
of
our
pictures
that
they
played
at
all,
they
played
down
here
on
the
short
half.
and
your
honors
will
note
from
this
chart
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
that
they
gave
us
on
the
average
$5,000
less
rental
per
picture.
now,
that
chart
accounts
only
for
85
of
our
196
pictures.
in
other
words,
111
pictures
that
we
distributed
were
totally
excluded
from
the
circuits
completely.
we
earned
no
revenue
whatsoever
from
the
circuits.
we
were
compelled
with
regard
to
those
pictures
to
go
to
the
marginal,
the
fringe,
the
scrap
of
the
theater
exhibition
market
in
new
york,
if
you
like,
to
go
to
what
mr.
raftery
refers
to
this
day,
really
arch
houses
and
see
what
we
could
do
there.
now,
to
the
rather
stark
discrimination
which
i
think
that
table
reflects,
in
terms
of
our
comparative
performance
data
and
the
comparative
rentals
paid
us
by
--
on
pictures
of
the
same
class
which
they
themselves
classed
the
same
because
they
put
them
in
those
playing
positions.
they
have
two
stocking
answer
that
they
like
to
make.
the
first
is
that
on
eagle
lion's
high-grade
pictures,
the
ones
where
we
got
approximately
half
as
much
as
they
did
on
rental
on
the
top
feature,
they
say,
“well,
those
pictures
just
didn't
have
any
appeal
for
new
york
audiences.”
on
the
pictures
down
the
short
half
where
quite
clearly
there
was
discrimination
practice
upon
us
and
neither
the
two
lower
courts
really
glanced
to
that
fact,
they
admitted
there
was
discrimination
there.
the
defendant's
answer
to
the
discrimination
down
that
short
half,
and
the
answer
that
was
incredibly
accepted
by
both
of
the
lower
courts
in
the
face
of
the
record
here,
was
that
even
though
they
had
discriminated
against
us
on
those
mediocre
pictures,
and
even
though
they
had
excluded
the
vast
majority
of
them
from
accessing
to
the
--
to
the
circuits
at
all,
that
we
didn't
suffer
any
injury
on
those
pictures
because,
said,
they've
taken
another
category
of
data
on
all
of
your
pictures
grossing
under
$500,000
nationally.
you
did
better
in
new
york
than
we
did.
you
took
relatively
more
out
of
new
york
in
terms
of
your
national
gross
than
we
did.
and
the
answer
to
that,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
we
did
take
more
out
of
new
york
on
those
low-grossing
pictures.
but
the
reason
why
we
did,
as
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
reason
why
we
did
is
because
in
those
low-grossing
pictures,
we
had
41
foreign-made
pictures,
pictures
made
abroad
and
sent
over
here
for
distribution
by
eagle
lion.
wonderful
pictures
in
my
judgment,
some
of
them
at
least,
winslow
boy,
quartet,
red
shoes
itself,
for
example,
was
a
foreign-made
picture.
but
the
circuits
aside
from
red
shoes
where
they
made
an
exception,
the
circuits
refused
absolutely
to
play
any
of
those
foreign-made
pictures.
and
playing
those
pictures
around
the
circuit
wherever
--
around
new
york,
wherever
we
could
find
a
house
to
which
we
could
get
in
and
it
was
not
easy.
we
nonetheless
managed
to
take
out
of
new
york
13.5%
of
our
national
gross
on
those
foreign-made
pictures.
this
was
a
larger
take
from
new
york
relatively
speaking
than
any
group
of
pictures
that
either
they
or
we
have.
now,
i
suggest
that
if
you're
going
to
use
this
under-$500,000
category
to
deny
us
any
damage
on
the
ground
we
weren't
hurt
even
in
the
face
of
outright
stark
discrimination
with
regard
to
the
pictures
that
got
in,
that
in
all
fairness
on
that
kind
of
a
calculation
you
exclude
the
foreign-made
pictures
because
they
didn't
get
in
at
all.
and
if
you
do
exclude
them,
then
the
record
shows
that
of
course
on
those
short
half
pictures
grossing
under
$500,000,
we
took
20%
less
out
of
new
york
than
they
did.
now,
we
think
under
the
yardstick
that
was
approved
by
the
bigelow
case
for
showing
their
damage
in
this
type
of
situation,
that
all
of
the
product
should
be
compared
by
whatever
comparative
performance
data
is
available.
and
quite
clearly,
we
have
tried
to
do
that.
we
have
taken
all
of
our
product.
we
have
taken
all
of
the
sample
pictures
they
made
available
to
us
for
comparison.
and
clearly,
if
you
take
that
kind
of
an
overall
picture,
you'll
get
i
think
the
clearest
and
the
most
honest
demonstration
of
what
happened
to
our
overall
business.
and
also,
equally,
obviously,
that
if
you
start
to
eliminate
categories
here,
they
are
the
top
someplace
else,
you
automatically
impair
the
validity
of
your
overall
comparison
by
taking
out
separate
categories
of
cases.
we
think
that
the
bigelow
case
justifies
the
view
that
should
take
an
overall
comparison
of
your
performance,
your
entire
performance
in
the
monopolized
market,
and
the
difference
between
that
on
your
own
behalf
and
that
of
the
defendants
is
your
measure
of
damage.
if
we
do
that
here
as
i
point
out
to
the
court,
we
show
that
on
our
overall
business
during
these
four
years
involved,
we
got
40%
less
of
our
own
national
grosses.
and
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
we
are
talking
about
our
own
national
gross,
we
are
not
trying
to
get
a
percentage
of
their
national
gross,
of
our
own,
40%
less
of
ours
out
of
new
york
than
they
got
of
their
national
gross
during
the
same
period
of
time.
we
suggest
that
the
record
will
reflect
that
the
only
real
offense
you
have
here
is
the
opinion
of
the
monopolist
when
all
was
said
and
done,
if
they
had
given
us
as
much
access
to
this
market
as
we
were
entitled
to.
indeed,
you
will
find
some
suggestions
in
the
record
that
maybe
they
were
very
benevolent
and
gave
us
more
than
we
might
have
gotten
if
competition
had
been
the
law
of
trade.
our
view
is
of
course
that
the
wrongdoer
rule
in
bigelow
was
fashioned
to
protect
a
victim
from
precisely
that
kind
of
a
defense.
that
under
the
wrongdoer
rule,
a
monopolist
who
has
denied
us
the
opportunity
for
a
competitive
test
to
the
quality
of
our
product
in
the
market
cannot
be
heard
to
come
forward
at
the
end
and
say,
“look,
i
gave
you
all
you
were
entitled
to.
indeed,
i
may
have
given
you
a
little
bit
more.”
we're
persuaded,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
we
--
are
to
have
the
benefit
under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act,
of
all
the
reasonable
inferences
to
which
we
think
we
are
entitled
from
the
paramount
judgment.
and
again
in
that
connection,
let
me
emphasize
that
we
appeared
as
witnesses
on
behalf
of
the
government
during
the
paramount
case,
we
may
whatever
small
contribution
we
could
to
the
effective
results
achieved
by
that
case.
but
we
say
that
if
we
are
to
have
the
benefit
of
all
reasonable
inferences
of
the
paramount
case
and
if
we
are
to
have
any
proper
application
of
the
wrongdoer
rule
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
bigelow
that
then
we
are
entitled
to
a
judgment
here.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
l.
mcgovern
if
the
court
please.
coming
to
this
last
point
that
mr.
gillespie
was
dealing
with
as
to
the
treatment
of
district
court,
the
court
of
the
paramount
case,
i
should
like
to
simply
point
the
court's
attention
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
said
at
the
conclusion
of
the
discussions
of
paramount
case.
the
paramount
case
did
not
involve
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
plaintiffs
were
prevented
from
licensing
their
pictures
on
an
equal
competitive
basis
to
the
defendants.
that
decision
was
not
put
in
that
case.
the
decree
in
that
case
does
not
constitute
prima
facie
evidence
of
any
such
ultimate
fact
because
i'll
repeat
in
the
next
paragraph.
“in
the
absence
of
actual
combination
or
conspiracy
deprived
the
plaintiffs
of
an
equal
competitive
opportunity.”
now,
i
pointed
out
in
my
argument
--
my
main
argument.
i
simply
reiterated
that
i
do
not
know
how
you
monopolize
a
market,
at
the
same
time
allow
independence,
they
have
competitive
access
to
that
market.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
are
mutually
exclusive.
and
if
the
paramount
judgment
is
given
the
benefit
for
which
we
claim,
and
if
accordingly,
it
is
found
that
rko
and
loew
monopolized
the
first
neighborhood
run
in
new
york,
then
manifestly,
we
were
denied
competitive
access
to
that
market.
of
course
we
weren't
entirely
excluded,
there's
no
argument
about
that,
but
i'm
saying
that
clearly
that
all
that
was
left
for
us
was
whatever
marginal
means
these
two
theater
circuits
might
have
after
they
took
care
of
their
assigned
co-conspirating
distribute
--
co-conspirator
distributors.
now,
both
lower
courts
refused
to
take
much
stock
in
the
notion
that
because
the
product
of
the
eight
measures
was
split
right
down
the
middle
as
i
explained
on
monday.
indeed,
because
they
split
the
universal
power
right
in
half,
both
lower
courts
refused
to
believe
that
that
meant
that
rko
and
loew
have
some
sort
of
an
obligation
to
take
care
of
their
assigned
co-conspirators.
this
is
the
reason
why
the
other
findings
in
the
paramount
case
are
important.
this
is
the
reason
why
the
government
agreed,
i
assume,
addresses
the
court's
attention
to
that
fact.
finding
147
for
example,
set
forth
in
the
record
at
629
reads
as
follows,
this
is
a
finding
by
the
three-judge
court
in
paramount.
“the
interdependency
of
defendants
to
obtain
pictures
for
their
theaters
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
will
obtained
theater
outlets
for
their
pictures.”
in
other
words,
both
ways.
to
get
pictures
for
the
theaters,
theaters
for
the
pictures
has
lessened
competition
among
defendants
and
between
them
in
independence."
down
in
finding
84,
the
court
found
both
independent
distributors
such
as
ourselves,
both
independent
distributors
and
exhibitors
when
attempting
to
bargain
with
the
defendants,
had
been
met
by
a
fixed
scale
of
clearance
runs
and
admission
prices
to
which
they
--
to
which
they
have
been
obliged
to
conform
if
they
wish
to
get
their
picture
shown
upon
satisfactory
terms.
and
in
finding
148
(f),
the
three-judge
court
again
held,
"this
power,
that
is
the
monopoly
power
they
have
just
described
resulting
from
this
circuit
tie-in,
“this
power
might
be
exercised
either
against
non-affiliated
exhibitors
or
distributors
for
the
ownership
of
what
was
generally
the
best
first
run
theaters
coupled
with
the
possession
by
the
defendants
of
the
best
pictures,
enable
them
substantially
to
control
the
market
in
first
run
pictures”.
now,
our
position
on
that
is
quite
simply
that
if
you
place
findings
154
(d)
and
conclusion
16
with
regard
to
the
local
market
in
new
york,
if
you
place
it
properly
in
the
context
of
the
overall
paramount
findings,
you
can't
escape
the
conclusion
that
in
new
york,
rko
and
loew
monopolized
the
theaters
and
split
the
product
of
their
assigned
co-distributors.
and
then
of
course,
in
order
to
be
taken
care
of
in
the
west
coast
by
fox
and
chicago
by
paramount
in
new
york
and
--
or
in
new
england
and
other
places
by
warner,
in
order
to
be
taken
care
of
their
--
reciprocally,
they
had
to
take
care
of
the
distributors
in
new
york,
in
the
market
which
they
controlled.
and
i'm
saying
that
that
being
the
case,
having
found
monopolization,
if
we
are
given
the
benefit
of
that
decision,
then
it's
impossible
to
find
that
we
were
granted
competitive
access
and
the
truth
of
course
is
we
were
not.
now,
mr.
raftery
speaks
of
failure
of
proof.
he
extols
two
men,
mr.
heineman
and
mr.
krim
here
today.
we
didn't
call
mr.
heineman
though
we
believe
that
he
was
a
first
rate
motion
picture
distributor.
he
was
vice-president
of
our
company
during
the
critical
period.
we
didn't
call
him
because
at
the
time
of
trial,
he
was
working
for
the
united
artist
company,
one
of
the
co-conspirators
here,
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
paramount
case.
we
didn't
call
mr.
krim.
he
was
also
working
for
united
artist
at
the
time
but
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
didn't
have
to
call
mr.
krim
at
the
time
of
trial
to
see
whether
he
had
any
ex
post
facto
rationalizations
for
what
happened
to
us
here
because
we
had
evidence
from
mr.
krim
in
the
record
as
to
what
was
happening
at
the
time.
and
i
address
the
court's
attention
to
a
letter
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
650,
“well,
mr.
krim
who
at
that
time
was
president
of
eagle
lion,
he
has
since
become
a
great
statesman
according
to
them
but
at
the
time,
he
was
distributing
and
producing
for
eagle
lion,
you
would
suppose
he
was
nothing.”
but
in
1948,
he
wrote
to
mr.
vogel
of
the
loew's
circuit
and
said,
“joe,
this
is
a
really
pathetic
situation.
before
i
took
on
my
present
responsibility,
i
naturally
knew
what
the
new
york
problem
through
my
activity
as
counsel
for
the
distributors.”
in
other
words,
mr.
krim
have
been
on
the
inside,
he
was
no
neophyte
here.
“but
i
never
realized
the
true
impact
until
it
was
this
opportunity
to
see
working
first
hand.
we
have
put
money,
time
and
energy
of
i
don't
know
how
many
people
in
the
task
of
building
our
company.
we
have
labored
night
and
day
for
the
past
two
years.
i
have
tried
to
demonstrate
the
vigor
and
the
initiative
to
take
on
obstacles
as
they
come
along
and
lick
them
but
nobody
has
come
up
with
any
answer
in
new
york.
there
is
no
doubt
the
solution
must
be
found,
no
company
operating
on
a
scale
such
as
power
has
confined
permanent
stability
about
having
a
fair
chance
of
getting
on
the
screen
in
new
york
city.”
he
then
raised
four
questions.
he
says,
“we've
been
doing
well
throughout
the
country
but
in
practically,
every
other
situation
that
we
have
broken
down
by
shear
force
yet
in
new
york,
we
are
still
limping
along.”
he
said,
“frankly,
i
find
it
impossible
to
explain
this
bottleneck
to
a
mr.
young
and
the
other
people
who
have
poured
so
much
money
into
our
operation.”
now,
he
says,
“apart
from
everything
else,
we
have
two
programs
that
without
any
doubt,
are
entitled
to
go
down
the
line.
one,
noose
hangs
high
and
raw
deal,
the
second,
canon
city
and
mickey.”
let's
just
take
those
four.
the
reply
back
from
mr.
vogel
is,
“dear
arthur,
i
love
you
very
much
and
we're
doing
the
best
we
can
to
get
you
in
but
frankly,
as
of
those
four
pictures
of
yours,"
and
on
page
652
of
the
record,
mr.
vogel
speaks,
“presently,
we
entertain
a
difference”
he
says,
“of
opinion
as
to
noose
hangs
high
and
raw
deal
as
a
double
feature
show.
we
think
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
book
those
two
films
together.
mr.
picker
notified
jack
schlaver
(ph),
one
of
our
employees,
that
we
would
be
willing
to
take
a
chance
and
play
canon
city
and
noose
hangs
high
together
on
one
bill.
we
disagree
also
on
mickey.
we
think
this
is
a
small
picture
and
could
only
be
used
on
the
short
half.
raw
deal
could
be
used
as
a
second
feature
on
the
long
half.”
now,
i'm
saying
that
those
are
the
words
of
the
monopolist
explaining
to
us
why
his
arbitrary
noncompetitive
judgment
is
what
it
is.
i
suggest
under
the
anti-trust
laws,
we
were
entitled
a
competitive
judgment
and
that's
what
we're
asking
for.
thank
you.
