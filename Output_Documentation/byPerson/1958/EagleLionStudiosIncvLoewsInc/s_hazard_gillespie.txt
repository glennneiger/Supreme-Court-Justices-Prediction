mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
speak
for
the
respondent,
loew's
incorporated.
during
the
period
involved
in
this
suit,
loew's
incorporated
was
engaged
not
only
in
the
production
and
exhibition
of
pictures
but
in
the
operation
of
theaters,
a
number
of
which
where
in
the
new
york
area.
mr.
raftery,
as
he
was
concluding
his
argument
was
about
to
make
reference
to
a
mr.
youngstein.
mr.
youngstein,
he
mentioned,
was
in
charge
of
exploitation
and
advertising
and
promotion
of
the
eagle
lion
pictures.
he
was
called
not
by
my
friends
but
i
called
him.
i
called
him
because
i
was
tremendously
interested
in
having
someone
testify
as
to
the
quality
of
these
pictures
who
would
know
about
the
quality
of
these
pictures
and
could
inform
the
court
of
what
mr.
raftery
has
been
saying
in
general
to
you
gentlemen
here.
mr.
youngstein
testified
that
he
was
with
eagle
lion
commencing
in
1946,
the
damage
period
involved
here
and
right
down
to
almost
the
end
of
the
period.
he
then
left
eagle
lion,
but
he
said
he
was
familiar
as
to
all
of
these
pictures.
and
if
your
honors
will
refer
to
his
testimony
which
is
not
very
long,
you
will
find
that
he
testified
that
the
pictures
that
he
had
by
and
large
were
just
the
drecks
of
the
motion
picture
industry.
that
so
far
as
their
suitability
for
the
new
york
market
were
concerned
that
they
were
far
inferior
to
the
product
of
the
eight
major
distributors,
that
he
was
had
the
task
of
trying
to
exploit
those
pictures
and
that
he
knew.
now
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
not
a
word,
your
honor.
not
a
word.
my
adversaries
didn't
call
a
single
person
to
contradict
that
testimony.
on
top
of
that,
i
called
mr.
downing,
mr.
russel
downing,
he
was
the
head
of
the
radio
city
music
hall
in
new
york,
absolutely
independent
house,
no
connection
with
any
of
us.
he
testified
to
the
same
thing.
he
said
that
he
had
shown
pictures
of
every
one
of
these
eight
distributors
over
this
period
of
time
and
a
number
of
many
of
them,
he
had
screened
as
they
say,
the
pictures
of
eagle
lion
but
he
could
not
find
one
that
was
satisfactory
for
the
--
for
his
theater.
and
he
furthermore
testified
that
that
comparative
suitability,
the
same
by
mr.
youngstein,
that
they
were
vastly
inferior
to
those
of
the
eight
mentions
for
the
new
york
market.
now,
we
did
not
stop
there.
you've
heard
mr.
mcgovern
say
here
today
and
this
was
--
was
pretty
key
in
this
situation.
he
said,
"all
we
ask
is
the
same
break
that
they
got
on
their
pictures."
let's
see.
“we
had
and
they
had”
he
said,
“westerns.”
he
kept
emphasizing
that
we
were
seeking
the
same
break.
now,
in
connection
with
that,
i
think
i
should
tell
your
honors
that
mr.
mcgovern
felt
and
argue
to
the
district
court
that
quality
of
pictures
is
something
that
you
cannot
testify
to
in
the
abstract.
that
he
felt
that
box
office
rentals,
once
you
got
in
the
form
of
rental
for
your
pictures
across
the
country
was
what
really
control
in
determining
whether
you
had
quality.
and
if
your
honors
will
permit
me,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
that
place
in
the
record
where
mr.
mcgovern
said
this
to
the
district
court.
excuse
me
just
for
a
moment.
on
page
265
of
the
record,
mr.
mcgovern
stated
to
the
district
court,
“i
say
that
the
only
alternative
that
we
have
is
to
compare
a
performance
of
our
pictures
in
this
area
with
the
performance
of
their
pictures
in
this
area.
and
i
know
of
no
way
it
can
be
done
except
relating
these
performances
with
our
nationwide
film
rentals
which
is
the
best
index
of
quality
you
have.
it
isn't
the
question
whether
it
play
broadway
first
class
or
second
class
house.
the
question
is
what
--
the
question
is
what
it
did
actually
take
into
the
box
office
in
terms
of
film
rental.”
now,
he
had
previously
taken
the
position
to
the
district
court
that
the
quality
of
these
pictures
was
to
be
shown
that
the
quality
of
these
pictures
that
all
he
was
asking
for
was
a
comparison
of
pictures
of
like
quality.
in
other
words,
our
pictures
are
of
a
certain
quality
with
his
pictures
of
a
certain
quality.
so
when
his
accountant
took
the
stand
and
put
in
this
testimony
that
your
honors
have
heard
about,
showing
that
they
got
6.4%
of
their
national
rentals
from
the
new
york
metropolitan
area
whereas
we
got
8.9%
of
our
--
or
the
major
distributors
got
8.9%
of
their
--
of
their
national
film
rentals
from
the
new
york
area,
we
asked
that
accountant
on
cross-examination
if
he
could
breakdown
those
figures
on
a
basis
of
comparative
film
rentals.
in
other
words,
all
pictures
grossing,
let's
say,
nationally
up
to
a
$100,000.
and
then
all
pictures
grossing
from
a
$100,000
to
$200,000
and
from
$200,000
to
$300,000
and
so
on
to
see
if
the
pictures
of
comparable
national
film
rentals
which
he
said
is
the
best
test
of
quality
actually
performed
better
or
worse
in
the
new
york
market.
and
the
results
of
that
--
of
that
question
--
of
that
questioning,
two
years
accounting
expert
are
set
forth
in
loew's
exhibit
b
which
is
here
in
the
record
and
i'd
like
to
take
your
honors
time
for
a
moment
to
look
at
that.
it's
at
page
668
of
volume
2
of
this
record.
it's
a
table
that
draws
out
--
mr.
justice
douglas,
it's
a
long
sheet
right
there.
now,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
this
table,
this
as
i
say
was
developed
completely
on
cross-examination
of
their
accountant.
it
is
his
figures
and
he
verified
them
for
me
afterward.
you'll
see
in
the
lower
left
hand
corner
the
familiar,
196
which
is
the
number
of
the
eagle
lion
pictures
on
which
their
claim
is
predicated.
you'll
see
over
in
the
right
hand
middle
of
the
page,
the
96
so-called
"median
pictures"
which
are
supposed
to
be
representative
of
the
eight
major
distributors.
and
then
you
will
see,
in
addition
to
that,
the
familiar
6.4
in
your
ratio,
right
opposite
your
196,
and
you'll
see
the
familiar
8.9
over
at
--
on
the
right
hand
side
as
the
ratio
of
the
eight
distributor
defendants.
now,
i
asked,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
accountant
for
eagle
--
for
eagle
lion
to
break
these
down
and
to
tell
me
what
the
percentage
would
be
on
pictures
under
100,000.
these
poor-class
pictures
which
she
said
he
wanted
to
have
the
same
treatment
as
our
poorer-class
pictures.
so
those
97
pictures,
we
see
the
ratio
with
6.9%.
in
other
words,
they
got
6.9
of
their
national
film
rental
out
of
the
new
york
market.
what
did
we
--
what
did
the
eight
distributors
get?
they
had
seven
pictures
under
a
100,000
and
they
got
5.2.
in
other
words,
substantially
less
out
of
the
new
york
market
than
did
eagle
lion.
we
then
got
past
to
the
next
category
of
100,000
to
200,000.
they
had
51
pictures,
they
had
5.4%.
the
eight
distributors
had
10
pictures
in
that
class.
they
got
only
4.9%.
so
on
in
each
$100,000
category,
right
straight
through
up
to
$500,000.
and
you'll
find
that
177
of
their
pictures
out
of
their
196
had
a
--
a
percentage
of
6.2%
whereas
the
eight
distributors
had
35
pictures
under
$500,000
and
had
5.9%.
in
other
words,
up
to
$500,000
in
every
single
category,
they
had
a
higher
percentage
than
the
eight
distributors.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor.
it
covers
the
entire
period
that
--
for
which
damage
is
claimed.
that
is
from
1946
to
1950.
now,
there
are
19
states
as
i
say
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
this
was
a
question
for
the
trial
of
the
case
and
it
was
before
judge
dawson.
and
of
course,
he
came
to
his
findings
that
show
up,
your
honors
may
not
be
familiar
with.
and
that
is
at
the
close
of
his
opinion,
he
said,
“plaintiffs
had
failed
to
prove
that
any
losses
which
they
may
have
sustained
were
approximately
caused
by
any
combination
or
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
to
deprive
the
plaintiffs
of
such
--
such
opportunity
to
license
their
pictures
on
a
competitive
basis.”
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
page
581
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes,
they
did,
your
honor
and
i
was
--
actually
that
was
two
minutes
of
the
opening
of
my
argument
but
i
did
want
to
follow
forward
with
what
the
chief
justice
had
in
mind.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
they
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
your
honor,
i
will
try
to
do
that.
i
would
--
i
would
do
my
best
to
do
that.
i'll
watch
the
clock
halfway.
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
answer
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
it
--
it
may,
it
may,
i
--
i'm
going
to
get
to
the
--
the
law
in
a
--
just
a
few
moments.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
answer
your
question
as
to
judge
waterman.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
692
of
the
record,
you'll
see
that
judge
waterman
set
out
the
two
questions
which
were
framed
by
the
pre-trial
order
there.
one
was,
"did
paramount
establish
this
conspiracy?"
and
two,
"if
so,
did
that
--
was
it
that
conspiracy
which
was
the
proximate
cause
for
the
losses
suffered
by
eagle
lion?"
and
then
judge
waterman
went
on
and
said,
"the
trial
court
answered
both
questions
in
the
negative
and
dismissing
the
complaint,
end
of
judgment
for
the
defendants."
on
appeal,
we
affirmed
that
judgment
since
we
discerned
no
error
of
law
in
the
proceedings
below
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
were
clearly
erroneous
citing
rule
52
(a).
and
they
considered
themselves
bound
by
the
finding
made
by
judge
dawson
to
the
effect
that
the
petitioner's
loses
were
not
proximately
caused
by
any
conspiracy
or
combination
on
the
part
of
the
respondents.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor,
i
do.
now,
if
i
might
just
go
back
for
a
moment
to
that
loew's
exhibit
b
where
we
saw
that
177
of
these
pictures,
that
is
90%
of
the
petitioner's
pictures
on
their
own
figures,
did
better
in
the
new
york
market
than
those
of
the
eight
distributors.
that
leaves
19
pictures
out
of
their
196
in
which
on
their
figures,
they
did
not
do
as
well.
so
what
did
we
do
about
that?
i
have
an
exhibit
made
up.
we
looked
into
every
one
of
those
--
those
pictures,
and
if
your
honor
just
turn
a
few
pages
beyond
loew's
exhibit
b
to
loew's
exhibit
f
which
is
printed
in
the
same
volume,
just
a
few
--
pages
672,
a
--
as
to
everyone
of
those
19
pictures
where
they
didn't
do
as
well
as
our
pictures
or
as
these
eight
distributors'
pictures,
as
to
every
single
one
of
those
pictures,
they
got
a
complete
showing
on
the
entire
loew's
or
rko
circuit
and
that
is
shown
on
this
exhibit.
you'll
see,
for
example,
(inaudible)
as
the
first
one
that's
listed
there.
it's
showed
in
60
loew's
theaters.
and
then
out
of
the
blue,
on
the
same
show,
also
showed
in
60
loew's
theaters.
we
--
not
only
were
those
pictures
got
a
complete
showing
on
the
loew's
and
the
rko
circuit
but
of
that
number,
17
of
these
pictures
had
what
is
called
the
preferred
playing
time,
that
is
the
long
half
of
the
week.
and
of
that
number
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
six
of
them,
your
honor
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
--
had
top
billing.
now,
on
additional
reason
that
i
call
mr.
youngstein
here
in
charge
of
promotion
and
exploitation
is
i
wanted
to
find
out
if
those
pictures
have
had
the
treatment
that
he
thought
they
were
entitled
to.
and
he
testified
unequivocally
that
viewing
the
product
that
was
available
at
that
time,
in
that
situation,
he
said,
“i
regarded
those
pictures,
every
one
of
them
had
the
playing
position
to
which
they
were
entitled.”
now,
that
testimony
stands
absolutely
uncontradicted,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
cuts
across
it
in
any
way
whatsoever.
so
here,
you
have
a
picture
that
on
177,
90%
of
their
pictures,
they
did
better
than
we
did.
on
the
remaining
pictures
where
they
didn't
do
quite
as
well,
their
own
man
in
charge
of
exploitation
and
promotion
said
that
they
got
the
playing
position
to
which
they
were
entitled.
now,
if
i
may
refer
back
once
more
to
mr.
mcgovern's
statements
at
the
opening.
and
i
say
the
opening
of
the
trial
of
this
case
because
that's
before
we
cross-examined
their
accountant
and
brought
out
these
categories
of
equal
quality
as
they
say.
in
his
opening,
mr.
mcgovern
stated
to
the
court
--
excuse
me
just
a
moment.
i'm
reading
your
honor
from
page
31
of
the
record.
this
was
mr.
mcgovern's
opening
referring
to
these
percentages
that
they
were
going
to
rely
on
this
case.
and
i'm
not
starting
at
the
beginning
of
this
sentence,
i
want
to
say
that
to
the
court
because
i
don't
think
the
opening
part
of
it
bears
on
what
i
have
to
say,
it's
a
long
sentence.
and
it's
the
following
paragraph
that
i
want
to
bring
particularly
to
your
honors'
attention.
it's
page
31,
i'm
reading
opposite
folio
25.
“we
will
undertake
to
show
that
during
this
period
of
time,
we
derived
from
this
new
york
metropolitan
first-run
area
about
6.--
6.4%
of
our
total
national
gross
absent
the
new
york
--
new
york
metropolitan
area
whereas
the
defendants
during
the
same
period
of
time
were
taking
out
of
new
york
on
the
average,
8.9%
of
that
total
national
gross.
now,
this
is
what
is
important.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
the
only
fair
and
valid
measure
we
can
use
as
a
yardstick
to
determine
what
the
impact
of
the
conspiracy
upon
us
was.”
in
other
words,
at
the
time
of
his
opening,
these
figures
were
offered
as
the
only
fair
proof
of
impact
upon
him.
well
now,
your
honors,
you
can
see
what
has
happened
when
those
statistics
are
really
taken
apart
as
they
were
by
his
own
accountant.
we
submit
that
there
was
just
no
proof
of
impact
as
far
as
this
is
concerned.
now,
if
i
may
now
turn
for
a
few
moments
from
the
facts
and
go
back
to
--
go
back
to
the
subject
of
the
law,
turning
to
the
two
questions
which
the
district
court
had
before
it
and
as
we
understand
it,
the
two
questions
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it
and
as
we
believe,
the
two
questions
before
your
honors
have
before
you.
that
is
whether
paramount,
the
first
20
years,
whether
paramount
established
a
conspiracy
in
combination
on
the
part
of
rko
and
loew's
to
deprive
the
petitioners
of
the
opportunity
of
licensing
their
pictures
competitively
to
the
loew's
and
rko
circuits.
second
--
and
of
course,
is
whether
assuming
such
a
combination
or
conspiracy,
there
was
proof
of
impact
of
that
combination
or
conspiracy
upon
the
petitioners
here.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
first
of
these
two
questions
now.
preliminary,
let
me
make
it
absolutely
clear,
the
district
court
admitted
not
only
the
decree
in
united
states
against
paramount,
but
admitted
the
findings
and
the
conclusions
and
he
spent
days
pouring
over
the
record
in
united
states
against
paramount,
which
as
your
honors
know
was
a
very
lengthy
one.
furthermore,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
confine
its
consideration
of
the
decree
and
the
findings
and
conclusions
solely
to
this
controversial
finding,
154
(d)
which
i'll
refer
to
and
talk
with
you
about
in
a
moment,
and
conclusion
of
law
16,
which
is
the
petitioners
and
i
believe
the
amicus
brief
would
have
you
understand.
at
the
time
that
the
decree
and
findings
and
record
were
offered
in
evidence
in
the
district
court,
judge
dawson
said
that
under
the
emich
decision
of
this
court,
and
i
quote
from
page
52
of
the
record.
“the
court
may
look
at
any
of
the
papers
or
record
or
any
other
papers,"
and
i
end
the
quote.
similarly,
judge
waterman,
after
he
had
finished
discussing
this
subject
and
particularly
discussing
154
(d)
and
conclusion
of
law
16,
went
on
and
said
and
i
quote
from
judge
waterman,
“in
addition
to
finding
number
154
(d)
and
conclusion
number
16,
the
appellants
call
our
attention
to
findings
84,
99,
100,
127,
147
(c),
156
(b)
and
158
and
conclusions
number
7
and
12
of
the
final
decree
in
the
paramount.
we
have
examined
these
findings
and
conclusions
as
well
as
the
many
other
findings
and
conclusions
embodied
in
that
decree.
we
conclude
that
their
relevance
of
the
issues
here
in
suit
is
even
less
than
that
of
finding
number
154
(d)
and
conclusion
16
which
are
discussed
in
detail
in
our
opinion.”
now,
i
have
emphasized
the
scope
of
the
consideration
given
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
here.
because
while
the
petitioners
may
differ
with
those
courts
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
paramount
findings
and
decree
can
be
interpreted
as
establishing
the
conspiracy
which
they
claimed
to
exist
here.
i
don't
think
that
they
can
claim
successfully
that
the
emich
decision
was
now
in
any
way
--
or
that
the
application
of
prior
decrees
under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act
has
been
limited.
i
think
they
can
disagree
and
undoubtedly
do
whether
--
or
entitled
in
this
world
to
disagree
with
the
proposition
of
the
interpretation
of
that
decree.
but
i
don't
think
judge
dawson
or
the
court
of
appeals
narrowed
the
rules
at
all.
they
looked
at
it
and
they
came
--
just
came
to
a
different
interpretation.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
just
one
moment
to
this
154
(d)
and
16
which
are
the
ones
where
i
think
they're
key
as
far
as
the
conclusion
which
was
reached
by
the
lower
court
--
that
the
lower
courts,
that
to
this
--
that
the
decree
in
the
paramount
case
did
not
establish
the
conspiracy
claim
to
exist
here.
now,
the
key
words
of
154
(d)
which
are
set
out
at
page
636
of
the
record
are
as
follows,
and
i
think
your
honors
will
be
familiar
with
them.
in
new
--
they
will
be
familiar
to
you.
in
new
york
city,
loew
and
rko
divided
the
neighborhood
prior
run
product
of
the
various
defendant
distributors.
i
emphasize
those
words,
"of
the
various
defendant
distributors,"
under
a
continuing
arrangement
so
that
there
was
no
competition
between
them
in
obtaining
pictures.
petitioners
urge
below
as
they
do
here
that
this
was
the
finding,
that
there
was
no
competition
between
loew's
and
rko
not
only
in
obtaining
the
pictures
of
the
defendant
distributors
referred
to
in
the
finding
but
any
pictures.
now,
we
strenuously
disagree
with
this.
we
recognize
that
154
(d)
is
a
finding
that
there
was
not
competition
between
loew's
and
rko
for
the
product
of
the
eight
distributor
defendants.
but
we
insist
that
it
does
not
follow
from
that,
that
there
was
not
competition
between
these
same
loew's
and
rko
for
the
product
of
other
distributors.
and
with
that,
the
district
court
agree
and
also
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
a
--
a
fagot?
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if
i
can
continue
the
figure
of
speech.
i
would
say
here
that
i'm
dealing
with
the
burning
end
of
the
fagot
at
this
point
because
this
is
the
thing
that
they
drive
home
on
us
all
of
the
time.
and
i
think
this
is
the
only
finding
and
conclusion
which
specifically
refer
to
this
new
york
area.
and
while
i
think
they
do
like
to
think
in
terms
of
trying
to
bring
in
as
much
of
the
other
findings,
they
honestly
--
i
can't
go
take
the
time
now
to
go
through
every
one
of
them
with
your
honor,
but
i
think
when
your
honor
does
look
at
them,
you
will
see
that
judge
waterman
is
correct.
there
is
less
relevance
to
this
than
these
specific
findings
and
conclusion
which
do
point
admittedly
right
at
the
new
york
area.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
quite
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
it
must
be
aimed
at
the
particular
local
area
if
you're
going
to
use
it
as
prima
facie
proof
of
a
situation
in
a
local
area
as
they
have
done
here.
now,
i
would
--
we
--
in
saying
that
this
finding,
number
154
(d),
does
not
mean
that
there
was
no
competition
between
us
for
other
pictures.
we
don't
just
rely
on
the
language
of
that
finding
at
all.
but
we
do
rely
upon
the
fundamental
theory
of
the
paramount
case.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
they
did
not,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
your
opinion
in
united
states
against
paramount,
it
was
said
that
the
chief
argument
at
the
bar
is
placed
in
terms
of
monopoly
of
exhibition.
and
then
further
on
in
the
same
opinion,
the
central
problem
presented
by
these
cases
is,
which
exhibitors
get
the
highly
profitable
first-run
business.
in
other
words,
you
have
a
picture
here
in
paramount
where
exhibitors,
theater
operators
was
scrambling
for
the
early
showing
in
their
area,
in
their
neighborhood
of
the
best
possible
pictures
and
at
the
earliest
possible
time.
now,
in
view
of
that
we
say,
if
loew's
and
rko
were
doing
the
same
thing
and
they're
accused
of
having
--
doing
the
same
thing
and
taking
up
too
much
as
between
themselves,
they
were
doing
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
pictures
which
were
not
part
of
this
conspiracy.
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
under
those
circumstances,
that
no
inference
can
be
drawn,
that
there
was
no
competition
between
loew's
and
rko
with
respect
to
other
pictures.
and
i
submit
the
evidence
bears
this
out
completely.
we
offered
proof
that
during
the
period
from
1946
to
1950,
the
loew's
theaters
showed
no
less
than
89
of
the
196
pictures
of
eagle
lion,
and
rko
showed
even
more
over
a
hundred.
and
on
top
of
that,
we
offered
proof
that
we
showed
the
product
of
38
other
independent
distributors
during
that
time.
and
i
say
in
light
of
that,
you
cannot
draft
on
to
section
--
to
finding
154
(d)
any
idea
that
there
wasn't
competition
between
us
for
the
product
of
other
distributors.
for
now,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct
not
only
in
their
conclusion
with
regard
to
united
states
against
paramount
but
we
think
perhaps
even
more
important
because
if
your
honors
concur
in
this
view,
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
on
to
the
question
of
the
application
of
u.s.
against
paramount,
that
assuming
any
combination
or
conspiracy
that
there
was
not
established
in
any
way
with
respect
to
this
second
question
that
there
was
any
impact
of
this
conspiracy
as
against
the
petitioner's
pictures.
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes,
certainly.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that's
all
right,
i
think
maybe
i
can
find
it
for
you,
705
of
the
record,
i
got
it.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
furthermore,
i
think
if
your
honor
will
turn
back
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
to
the
earlier
part,
that's
what
leads
us
to
believe
that
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
correct.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
we
think
he
was
talking
in
terms
of
amount
--
the
third
item,
amount
of
damages.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
gillespie
told
you
in
part
(inaudible)
bought
pictures
from
38
different
distributors
during
the
(inaudible).
we
have
to
go
into
31
different
(inaudible)
