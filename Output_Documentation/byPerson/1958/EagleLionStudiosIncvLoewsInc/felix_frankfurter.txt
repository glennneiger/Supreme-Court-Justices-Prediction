well,
the
bigelow
case
really
doesn't
touch
this
problem
whatever
the
word
"cause"
maybe.
that
was
merely
a
question
of
how
you
can
prove
the
resulting
damage
from
the
conceded
violation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
submitted
in
that
case,
though
such
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
touching
the
merits
of
this
question
by
my
remark,
but
the
bigelow
--
in
the
bigelow
case,
there
was
no
controversy
as
to
the
law.
the
question
was,
how
speculative
and
they
maybe
the
determination
of
the
damages.
and
that
case
merely
says
the
burden
formed
on
the
fellow,
on
the
wrongdoer
and
they
don't
have
to
be
very
particular
in
figuring
out
the
dollars
and
cents
of
it.
that's
all
the
bigelow
case
is
to
me.
i
know
all
the
cases
which
is
cited
there
so
far.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
speculate
of
the
starting
point.
you
can't
speculate
about
the
starting
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
you
can't
make
a
reasonable
estimate
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
a
wrong.i
know
the
record
of
that
but
i
didn't
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
mingle
with
that
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
its
limit.
and
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
made
to
go
beyond
the
scope
of
that
decision.
it
has
nothing
to
do
whether
you're
right
or
wrong
in
your
contention
that
i
always
(inaudible)
cases
go
beyond
where
they
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
disagree
on
the
main
question.
i
didn't
--
there's
no
controversy
between
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
wrong
in
that
case.
the
question
was,
why
do
you
ask
a
claim
of
damages?
is
that
the
only
different
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
binding
on
me.
don't
get
any
wrong
impression.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
binding
on
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
binding
on
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
don't
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
words
taken
out
of
a
decision
blown
up
beyond
the
scope
that
the
record
indicates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that's
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
way,
may
i
ask
you
whether
this
case
is
reargued
after
judge
frank
says
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
there
was
no
suggestion
asking
counsel
--
assuming
that
counsel
would
have
no
objection
to
that
stuff.
is
that
added
in
the
letter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
didn't
imply
any
of
this
point?
i'm
just
as
curious
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
court
was
constituted
as
to
one
member
to
whom
it
is
argued
died.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
oral
argument
is
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gillespie
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
view
of
justice
douglas'
question--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
hope
--
i'd
like
to
say,
i
hope
you
leave
yourself
time
to
deal
explicit
with
the
claims,
with
the
contention
of
the
amicus
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think,
they're
got
to
cross
under
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
particularly
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gillespie,
the
--
the
burden
of
the
government's
position
as
i
understand
it,
usually
a
figure
of
speech
which
i
suppose
is
that
the
decree
was
a
fagot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
fagot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
to
go
through
the
state.
in
other
words,
the
decree
began
to
take
a
particular,
154
and
so
on.
but
--
but
they're
interrelated
and
that
each
affects
the
other
(inaudible)
and
you
can't
take
it
apart.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
that,
and
--
and
your
--
and
the
conclusive
--
and
from
that,
there
emerged
condemnations
beyond
what
is
found
in
specific
viewers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
that
the
provision
that
paramount
decree
established,
found
and
decreed
of
the
venues
of
the
third.
what
you're
saying
is,
no
matter
how
(inaudible).
