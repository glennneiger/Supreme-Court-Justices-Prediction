justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
in
this
statute
or
(inaudible)
deny
access
to
confidential
information
and
serious
enough
to
deny
access
to
the
secrets.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
in
this
case,
i
gather
while
he
has
now
a
clearance
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
secret,
yes
the
government
(inaudible)
not
serious
enough
to
deny
him
access
to
secrets.
and
yet
serious
enough
to
deny
him
access
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
not
the
(inaudible).
there
were
findings
by
the
board
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
government
had
derogatory
information
sufficient
to
deny
him
any
clearance
of
any
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
again
i'm
a
little
like
justice
frankfurter,
i
thought
what
mr.
rauh
said
was
that
on
the
second
go
around,
the
final
conclusion
was
factually
that
the
derogatory
information
or
that
the
information
in
the
possession
of
the
government
was
of
a
sufficiently
derogatory
nature
as
to
deny
any
clearance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
denial
of
any
clearance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
it
might
be,
it
was
sufficiently
derogatory
i
gather
in
the
government's
view
to
continue
the
denial
of
any
clearance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
in
respect
of
that
conclusion
that
the
government
possessed
derogatory
information
was
the
effect
of
the
acting
secretary's
reversing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
that
the
information
was
not
in
fact
derogatory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
that
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
the
second
alternative
that
would
be
that
yes,
there
was
derogatory
information
but
it's
not
of
such
nature
as
to
refuse
an
access
to
secret.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
which
alternative
was
the
secretary
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that
wasn't
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
confrontation
issue,
on
the
issue
of
mootness.
are
we
to
assume
that
they
is
still
outstanding
then
in
effect,
the
findings
arrived
at
that's
been
that
described
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
expunged
means
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
mean,
yes
formally
what's
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
17?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
i
was
paying
closer
attention
to
the
first
amendment
and
that
was
already
answered,
but
when
there
is
under
the
regulation
a
clearance
given,
is
the
reading
that
the
clearance
or
access
to
classified
defense
information
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security
or
how
is
it
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
be
affirmative,
that
his
access
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
we
don't
have
the
negative
given
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
think
it
is
a
form
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
he
is
clearly
consistent
with
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
in
that
connection,
that
was
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
if
you're
sure
mr.
solicitor,
do
i
understand
that
this
letter
of
mr.
(inaudible)
completely
expunges
all
previous
findings
in
this
case
as
if
they
had
never
been
rendered
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
has
the
affect
of
completely
obliterating
from
any
record,
his
employer's
record,
the
government
record,
any
other
record,
anything
connected
with
this
proceeding
which
could
be
embarrassing
or
harmful
to
him
in
the
future.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
his
--
what
about
the
--
i
understood,
did
i
understand
mr.
rauh
to
say
he
had
been
earning
$5,000
and
in
this
period
when
he
was
under
this
suspension,
he
was
kept
down
to
something
like
a
$1,000
a
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
he
did,
if
he
did,
any
redress
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
suppose
in
any
event
if
he
was
entitled
to
redress,
would
be
any
place
short
of
a
legislative
bill
or
get
it
for
him
from
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
mind
representing
the
employer,
isn't
it?[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
say
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
basis
of
all
that
mr.
solicitor
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
undercover
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
–
what
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
these
board
hearings
are
not
public
hearings
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
not
risk
the
risk
of
a
jealous
neighbor,
the
envious
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
like
to
say
it
is
handled,
i
understood
the
board
members
here
never
even
saw
any
of
these
witnesses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
other
four
that
gets
down
to
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
not
seen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
know
whether
they
were
neighbors
or
fellow
employees
or
may
have
had
a
beef
against
this
fellow
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
suggestion
below
in
this
case
that
any
of
this
stuff
might
be
shown
to
the
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
would
be
true
in
the
greene
case
you
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you
said
--
what
was
the
first
of
those
reversing
the
earlier
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
result
of
expunging?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
suppose
reversing
the
finding
is
a
little
different
from
asking
affirmative
findings,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
is
that
none
of
the
action
reverses
anything
in
the
way
findings
merely
expunges
that
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
i
noticed
that
there's
monetary
substitution,
section
26,
currently
is
available
only
to
the
contract
of
employee
as
to
whom
a
final
determination
is
favorable.
does
taylor
fit
with
that
category?
