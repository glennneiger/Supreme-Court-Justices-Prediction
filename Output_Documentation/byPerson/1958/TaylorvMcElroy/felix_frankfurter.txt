justice
felix
frankfurter
where
can
i
find
the
names
of
all
the
members
of
the
board
in
addition
to
mr.
waldman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
not
a
under
contract
with
his
employer
was
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
be
fired
any
day
by
the
employer
for
no
reason,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
contracts
specifically
covering
this
kind
of
condemnation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
would
you
would
agree
that
it
--
your
sense
of
unfairness
will
be
--
a
fairness
will
be
just
as
much
(inaudible)
employee
who
is
not
under
this
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
be
fried
at
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
all
had
to
wait
till
they
get
out
of
office
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
formal
source
of
exertion
of
this
power,
what
piece
of
paper,
what
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
this
proceeding
has
been
going
on
how
long?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
mean
there
is
no
specific
basis
for
this
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
there
is
no
--
you
can't
point
to
a
provision
which
says
that
confidential
sources
shall
not
be
revealed
even
to
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
signature
–
whose
signature
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
clearance,
where
a
person
is
under
investigation,
is
the
clearing
at
large
generally
or
is
it
a
clearance
for
a
particular
job?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
man
is
employed
in
a
given
position
by
the
employer,
and
he
is
under
question,
as
to
that
job
he
is
under
question
isn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
he
maybe
shifted,
if
he
gets
a
clearance
on
a
particular
level,
his
clearance
is
for
any
position
he
may
fill
on
that
level.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
case
apply
that
to
taylor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
the
original
action,
where
the
original
action
left
taylor?
and
he
was
not
cleared.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
limitations
were
put
upon
his
employers
as
to
him
regarding
the
accessibility
of
information
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
sources
of
classified
information
were
denied
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
his
claim
has
done
under
the
new
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
didn't
they
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
earlier
memorandum?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no
in
the
earlier
one,
january
9.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
what
claim
was
made
in
that
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
(inaudible),
i
don't
understand,
what
is
the
meaning
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
construction
of
what
the
conflict
is
in
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
consequences
are
as
to
him
in
case
he
applied
for
a
job
with
his
former
employers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
the
department
says
we've
cleared
you,
there
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
he
have
access
to
the
materials
that
theretofore
he
would
not
have
had
access
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
do
you
say
nothing
was
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
record
wiped
clean
so
that
nothing,
there
was
nothing
outstanding
against
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
had
the
job
and
the
emoluments
that
had
there
before.
i
repeat
my
question,
why
do
you
say
nothing
was
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
you
couldn't
come
here
objecting
the
regulation
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
only
--
you
are
not,
i
understand
that,
you
could
only
come
in
because
somebody
has
been
hurt
by
the
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
to
what
extent
he
has
remained
hurt
after
the
suggestion
of
the
mootness,
except
that
they
may
do
the
same
thing
tomorrow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
(inaudible)
for
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
apparently
i
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
am
asking
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
first
time
you
tried
to
instruct
me
mr.
rauh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
have
been
true
if
he
has
been
cleared
initially,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
couldn't
have
brought
a
suit
therefore
and
say
my
man
is
cleared
today,
but
some
stupid
or
malevolent
secretary
may
unclear
him
tomorrow,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
leave
that
question
when
you
get
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
they
have
to
make
a
speech
when
they
undo
a
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
first
time
you've
said
something
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
clearance
that
everybody
else
gets?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
only
case
that
you
know
where
there
was
a
clearance
“in
the
national
interest?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
basis
for
saying
that
there
was
a
sinister
purpose
behind
that
clearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
deduction
that
one
can
draw,
not
draw,
if
one
chooses
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
more
enlightening
to
me
or
rather
more
illuminating,
if
this
were
the
only
case
before
the
court
involving
these
issues,
but
it
isn't,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
why
i'm
a
little
puzzled,
why
they
should
go
to
these
extremes,
and
if
you're
right,
quite
unpardonable
steps
to
take
away
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
when
the
main
questions
remain
within
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
claim
is,
your
claim
is
that
this
whole
scheme
is
tainted
and
violative
of
the
constitution
if
the
constitutional
questions
are
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
raised
in
other
cases
just
as
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
after
his
non-clearance
is
that
(inaudible)
was
it
--
the
suggestion
was
made
in
the
fifth
case,
was
under
review,
how
much
time
had
elapsed,
just
roughly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
was
so
long
a
lapse
of
time
between
original
condemnation
and
subsequent
reconsideration
is
so
long
a
lapse
of
time,
and
unusual
and
it's
not
a
unique
thing,
in
the
clearing
process.
in
other
words
was
this
case
singled
out
with
your
suggestion
that
that
he
might
be
reviewed,
this
case
might
be
reviewed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
infer
from
what
you've
said
that
this
was
one
of
the
classic
cases
that
was
being
reconsidered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
of
i
understand
it,
when
this
case
came
to
the
department,
as
a
result
of
a
ligation
against
the
government,
it
led
the
department
to
consider
the
problems
of
the
case
and
are
you
saying
that
raised
the
question,
which
opened
up
reconsideration
of
other
cases
in
the
same
class?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
mr.
solicitor,
if
i
understood
mr.
rauh
correctly
and
i
mean
it,
i
think
--
i
got
the
impression
that
he
said
that
if
he
had,
had
a
clearance,
apart
from
the
question
that
there
maybe
a
reoccurrence
in
the
testimony,
if
he
had
a
clearance
that
he
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
national
security,
which
is
the
standard
form
for
clearance,
we
have
one
question,
but
his
clearance
was
he
cleared
in
the
national
interest,
and
i
got
the
impression,
i'm
not
suggestion
you
meant
to
convey
it,
but
i
got
it,
that
there
was
a
deviation
from
the
normal
clearance
criterion
of
phrasing
the
certificate
to
which
from
national
security
to
national
interest,
now
that
if
so
of
course
would
make
one
(inaudible),
that
this
fellow
have
national
interest
when
everybody
else
is
national
security,
on
the
assumption
that
i'm
not
misconstruing
or
misinterpreting
what
i
heard,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
certificate
of
clearance
was
individually
unique,
then
there
would
be
an
innuendo
of
something,
wouldn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
is
not
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
whether
there
is
any
difference
in
effect,
that's
another
--
what
you
say
the
difference
in
language,
and
this
fellow
is
singled
out
with
a
particular
piece
of
paper,
different
from
all
others
in
like
situations,
then
we'll
naturally
ask
some
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
me
the
vital
question
is
whether
this
particular
thing,
whether
it's
better
or
worse,
you
restricted
to
him
as
an
individual,
and
you
say
that,
that
is
not
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
the
hearing
board,
any
other
order
by
the
secretary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
why
was
this
special
unique
phrasing
used
for
him
as
against
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
wouldn't
he
the
next
day
say,
as
a
matter
of
national
security?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
as
to
taylor,
but
as
to
jones.
will
he
in
that
state
make
the
same
action,
but
change
the
phrasing
from
national
interest
to
national
security?
speaking
for
myself
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
my
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
the
other
such
actions
by
acting
secretary
quarles?
have
we
any
other
actions
in
which
in
the
other
cases
it
is
just
security
instead
of
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
what
you're
answering
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
criterion
to
be
applied
is
not,
is
it
in
national
interest,
the
criterion
to
be
applied
is,
that
it's
not
clearly
consistent
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
as
a
matter
of
english,
just
as
a
mere
(inaudible)
nothing
but
the
english
words,
i
should
think
that
the
same
as
to
allow
a
man
access
to
information
in
the
national
interest,
particularly
more
favorably,
it's
less
of
an
innuendo
against
the
person,
than
to
say
it's
not
clearly
consistent
with,
is
a
big
job
to
prove
that
negative,
and
the
records
on
this
subject
have
of
course
objected
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
is
much
more
favorite
unless,
and
this
is
what
you
go
to
the
court
with,
unless
there
is
some
design
in
making
the
differentiation
in
this
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
suggesting
it,
i
say
that
if
it's
really
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
then
i
agree
with
you,
(inaudible)
to
get
access
because
it's
in
the
national
interest
is
a
more
favorable
treatment
(inaudible)
than
i
believe
that
it's
not
clearly
consistent,
i
might
say,
as
white
as
a
new
born
baby,
as
innocent
as
a
new
born
baby,
as
white
as
an
angel
or
(inaudible)
and
you
might
be
able
to
say
well
not
clearly
consistent
with
that,
i
should
have
it,
i
might
be
a
very
good
man
and
yes
you
couldn't
proved
that
it's
not
clearly
consistent,
except
unless
you
have
this
somehow
or
other
singling
out
this
man
taylor,
and
you
got
a
record
on
that
as
to
what
the
secretary
has
been
doing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
that
was
no
clearly
inconsistent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
rejection
is
that
it's
not
clearly
consistent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
the
rejection
is
on
a
negative
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
clearly
consistent,
and
not
the
affirmative
way
that
it
is
consistent,
that
he
should
be
cleared.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
do
that
if
the
government
resists
the
claim,
you
can
pay
the
money
and
moot
it
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
dishonorable
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
speaking
for
myself,
i
think
not
only
is
the
government
within
its
right,
i
think
it's
its
duty
to
put
them
in
court
in
a
case
that's
pending,
it's
recognition
that
a
wrong
principle
was
employed
in
reaching
the
result
that
is
objected
to
provided,
there
isn't
less,
the
least
residual
remain
of
harm
to
the
person
whose
case
you're
trying
to
moot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand
i
think
the
interesting
--
beside
the
recovery
for
him,
if
this
was
a
wrong
principle
applied
by
people
ought
to
know
the
right
principle
under
the
federal
tort
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
government
be
able
to
have
a
form
of
the
clearance
specifically
made
out,
so
as
to
say
that
it
is
clear
and
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security
that
he
be
given
clearance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
see
things
like
the
different
connection,
what
we
call
(inaudible)
memorandum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
themselves
do
not
see
any
--
that
was
(inaudible)
memorandum
of,
what
do
you
call
it,
recording
of
the
witnesses
on
the
basis
of
which
the
charge
is
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
within
their
power
too
or
is
it
what
is
given
to
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
going
to
deal
specifically
or
are
you
with
the
concluding
lawyer
like
suggestion
if
i
may
say
so
mr.
rauh
that
he
doesn't
have
to
resort
to
constitutional
issues,
he
doesn't
have
to
resort
to
statutory
issues,
because
long
before
you
get
to
the
constitution,
if
there
is
a
statute,
and
you
don't
get
to
the
statute,
you
agree
with
that
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
with
him
that
the
case
really
gets
down
to
the
validity
of
an
administratively
devised
procedure,
having
it
(inaudible)
neither
in
an
act
of
congress
or
a
presidential
command.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
may
not
unfairly
be
construed
if
they
are
(inaudible)
to
restrict
the
affirmative
release
of
so
called
confidential
information
and
not
to
bring
it
into
the
open
where
another
interest
comes
into
play,
namely
the
man
is
charged
with
a
serious
acquisition,
which
entails
a
confrontation.
do
you
have
you
comments
to
make?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
be
good
enough
to
read
me
that
letter
out
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
in
response
to
the
letter
you've
read
from
the
--
the
general
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
i'm
--
i'm
not
suggesting
about
--
about
what
i'm
about
to
put
to
you,
if
there
is
any
impropriety
or
out
of
the
witness
about
this
--
about
this
(inaudible)
enlightened
correspondents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
suggest
that
since
it's
before
the
court,
it
might
be
just
as
well
to
put
in
writing
the
reply
you've
orally
made
to
mr.
rauh's
(inaudible).
could
it
be
--
i
mean
the
doctrine,
it
didn't
say
they're
merely
resting
on
pleading
words.
what
you've
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
court
reversed
it.supposing
the
key
of
your
argument
on
the
lowest
level
of
your
argument
(inaudible)
lowest
level
of
quality
of
your
argument
that
the
law
speak
about
--
suppose
it
reversed
it,
what
judgment
would
you
get
that
would
do
other
than
saying
that
that
the
determinations
of
the
departments
are
vacated,
what
else
would
you
get?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
never
--
they
never
can
reconsider
his
clearance
or
not
clear
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
was
declaratory
judgment.so
there's
no
injunctive
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
would
be
the
injunction
against
him
that
he
should
never
be
getting
inquired
into?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
might
not
decide
if
there's
no
authorization
for
the
program
and
yet
reversed
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
program
is
a
big
term.
it
doesn't
mean
that
everything
is
null
and
void.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
could
use
the
materials
as
lead
to
other
things,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
would
even
if
we
reverse
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
far
as
--
unless
there
is
a
decency
of
respect
which
must
be
attributed
to
a
member
of
the
cabinet
that
he
is
going
to
do
in
effect
by
circumvention
what
the
court
said
he
shouldn't
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
when
there
is
a
clearance,
are
there
affirmative
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
they
say
that
isn't
--
must
there
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
have
read
but
i'm
asking
you
what
the
practice
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
they
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
here.
what
are
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
addressing
the
board,
isn't
he?
because
here,
he's
addressing
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
not
doing
what
the
board
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
point
as
the
question
that
(inaudible)
why
did
justice
douglas
has
put
to
you
becomes
relevant
if
it
is
not
the
practice
of
the
secretary
to
make
affirmative
findings
if
we
are
to
reject
to
what
the
board
does.
you
are
not
actually
here
to
do
what
is
normally
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
question
of
non
--
was
your
position
if
it
is
not
moot
get
down
to
this
that
after
the
most
solemn
and
responsible
representation
by
the
government
through
the
solicitor
general
speaking
for
the
secretary
of
defense
that
this
is
wiped
out
and
that
there
will
not
be
a
reuse
of
these
materials,
it's
not
to
be
accepted
by
the
court.
is
that
what
it
gets
down
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that
in
this
case,
we
have
the
representation
of
the
government
to
the
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
general
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
of
defense,
stating
the
general
rule
applied
to
this
case
and
isn't
the
fact
that
it
isn't
moot
only
if
he
must
reject
those
representations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
on
the
merit.
i
noticed
that
at
least
in
the
indices
of
both
your
brief
and
the
government's
brief.
there's
no
reference
to
the
nugent
case.
is
that
because
that
involves
fbi's?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
reference
in
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
because
--
because
in
that
case
it
involved
undisclosed
confidential
information
of
fbi's?
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
inviting
you
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
my
favorite
case
as
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
think
they
were
in
the
nugent
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
other
distinctions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
doesn't
that
apply
to
current
conscientious
objectives
or
are
we
still
in
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
that
case
is
a
decision
of
the
court.
i
happened
to
dissent.
but
that
isn't
enough
of
a
ground
for
me
to
reject,
it
doesn't
say
it
doesn't
exist.
that
decision
is
not
expunged
in
any
sense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
consequences
there
are
almost
as
serious
as
here
aren't
they?
a
man
goes
to
jail.
