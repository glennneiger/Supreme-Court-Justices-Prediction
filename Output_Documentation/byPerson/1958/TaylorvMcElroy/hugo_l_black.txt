where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
been
out
of
a
job
all
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that
once
consequence
had
come
from
the
government
concurring
with
people
working
with
private
companies
and
doesn't
occur
that
the
government
would
do
something
to
it's
own
employees,
the
government
is
not
responsible
for
back
pay
(inaudible)
if
he
does
--
if
it
has
wrongfully
caused
him
to
lose
his
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
i
was
just
wondering
what
happened
to
the
--
a
great
number
of
people
should
be
caused
to
be
discharged
by
the
government,
ordinarily
if
some
private
company
did
that,
that
would
be
back
pay
recovery.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
get
it
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
board
got
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
the
party?
