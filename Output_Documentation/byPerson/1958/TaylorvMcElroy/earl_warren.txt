et

mr.
rauh
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
between
those
two
times
was
he
out
of
employment
or
was
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
mr.
rauh.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
may
i
ask
you,
all
the
others
who
worked
in
this
same
capacity
now
have
exactly
the
kind
of
clearance
you
have
offered
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general
does
he
have
now
what
is
the
equivalent
of
a
directive
of
the
secretary
of
defense
saying
that
we
do
not
recount
from
our
original
holding
that
you
were
a
communist
in
1942
and
1943
and
may
have
these
other
deficiencies,
but
nevertheless,
we
give
you
clearance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
there
is
some
language
in
the
letter
that
went
from
the
office
of
industrial
personnel
security
review
on
december
31,
1958
that
would
seem
to
carry
some
implication
with
it
anyway,
it
reads
as
follows.
by
these
letters,
this
is
to
--
from
the
department
to
the
bell
aircraft
corporation,
by
these
letters
you
are
informed
first
that
any
existing
security
clearance
mr.
taylor
then
had
should
be
suspended
and
second
that
after
considering
all
the
available
information,
it
had
been
determined
that
the
granting
of
clearance
to
charles
allen
taylor
for
access
to
classified
defense
information
was
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security,
and
then
it
goes
on,
subsequent
to
june
1957
mr.
taylor's
case
was
subject
to
further
consideration
by
this
department.
after
considering
all
the
available
information,
it
has
been
determined
that
the
granting
of
clearance
to
mr.
taylor
for
access
to
secret
defense
information
is
in
the
national
interest.
they
don't
use
the
standard
that
the
government
itself
set,
namely
that
it
was
not
--
that
it
was
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security.
now
is
there
any
real
difference
between
saying
in
the
one
instance
that
the
man's
access
to
classified
defense
information
was
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security
and
on
the
other
hand
that
he
is
cleared
saying
his
access
to
secret
defense
information
is
in
the
national
interest?
it's
all
in
the
same
letter
and
i
just
wonder
if
the
two
statements
in
the
same
letter
would
be
an
implication
that
he
is
not
in
the
same
category
as
others
who
were
cleared.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
may
i
ask
you
one
question
on
the
same
subject
matter,
suppose
if
a
man
came
to
bell
corporation,
aircraft
corporation
today
and
sought
employment
of
the
same
type
as
the
petitioner
had
and
he
was
screened
and
they
found
that
he
was
not
qualified
for
classified
information,
what
standard
would
they
use?
now
not
in
the
past,
but
what
standard
would
they
use
today
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
he
would
just
go
to
work,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
what
they
asked,
he
is
to
get
employment
just
like
this
man
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
say
he
had
exactly
the
same
duties
as
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
now
what
test
would
they
apply
to
him
in
determining
whether
he
was
entitled
to
any
clearance?
what
test?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
now
what
standard
would
he
have
to
meet?
now
to
make
it
a
little
more
clear,
as
i
understand
it,
when
the
petitioner
was
denied
access
the
test
was
that
his
access
to
classified
defense
information
was
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security.
now
is
that
the
test
that
this
new
man
would
have
to
undergo
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
if
he
was
cleared,
he
would
be
clearly
--
his
access
would
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
but
i'm
just
wondering,
the
same
things
troubled
me
as
well
as
a
few
moments
ago,
i'm
just
wondering
if
he
had
to
meet
that
that
test
and
did
meet
it.
if
it
is
not
different
from
where
they
just
say,
well
he
can
now
have
clearance
for
access
to
secret
defense
information
because
it's
in
the
national
interest.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
general
could
you
say
if
there
was
another
clearance
investigation
of
him
that
the
evidence
that
the
government
presented
undercover
to
the
board
would
be
obliterated
too?
is
that
all
wiped
out
or
isn't
that
there
still
to
be
used
for
any
purpose
if
the
government
wants
if
this
man
should
come
under
scrutiny
again
it
could
be
used
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
thought
maybe
because
you
had
successive
increase
of
this
man's
past
by
the
board
after
they
decide
that
once
and
a
second
time
and
then
again
that,
that
evidence
would
still
be
there
for
such
use
if
they
wanted
to
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
nobody
would
know,
would
they,
whether
it
was
there
or
not
because
nobody
knows
what
evidence
was
rejected.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
504,
charles
allen
taylor,
petitioner,
versus
neil
mcelroy
et
al.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
you
said
that
it
would
not
be
used
if
there
was
a
further
screening
of
this
man,
do
you
mean
under
your
proceedings,
it
--
it
could
not
--
could
not
be
used
or
do
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
grace
in
the
department
and
as
a
matter
of
fairness
that
the
present
incumbents
of
the
office
would
not
use
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
think
that's
just
--
that
--
that's
a
problem
that
bothers
me.
i
imagine
you
did
--
justice
clark
when
he
asked
the
--
the
question.
is
the
mere
expunging
of
the
--
of
the
records
tantamount
to
--
to
a
finding
on
the
subject
one
way
or
the
other?
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
just
loose
there,
isn't
it
just
in
limbo
and
--
and
couldn't
the
--
couldn't
that
information
against
this
man
become
available
again
from
a
standpoint
of
--
of
your
procedures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
there
--
what
is
there
in
--
in
your
procedure
that
are
in
the
statute
or
in
any
manner
that
says
that
--
that
when
--
when
this
disposition
is
made
of
a
case
if
we
put
this
--
is
not
--
the
finding
hasn't
been
reversed,
everything
has
just
been
expunged
from
the
record
except
the
documents
on
which
he
was
originally
found
to
be
not
consistent
with
the
security
of
the
country.
what
is
there
to
prevent
that
from
being
used
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
in
this
case
is
that
--
that
one
of
the
hearings
before
the
board,
they
found
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
a
certain
--
certain
time
and
he
was
expelled
for
that
reason.
then
he
asked
for
a
hearing
before
the
board
and
--
no,
after
that
hearing
rather,
they
took
his
testimony
to
the
effect
that
he
was
not
a
member
at
that
particular
time
that
he
was
actually
anti-communist
in
his
approach
to
problems.
and
they
then
supplemented
the
record
and
using
the
same
records
that
they
have
found
he
was
a
communist.
they
found
that
he
wasn't
a
communist
because
he
had
been
expelled
before
that
time.
now
what
--
what
would
prevent
the
same
thing
from
happening
here
in
another
circumstance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
abandoned
in
all
defense
industry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
here,
you
have
not
only
that
kind
of
a
witness.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
one
of
them
--
one
of
the
witnesses
was
of
that
character,
but
you
also
have
five
casual
witnesses
who
were
neighbors
or
perhaps
business
associates
or
someone
--
or
someone
else.
they
might
have
been
people
with
--
with
a
motive.
they
might
have
been
people
that
malice
against
the
man.
and
as
to
those
--
as
to
those,
why
wouldn't
he
have
a
right
to
be
confronted
by
them
if
my
neighbor
accuses
me
of
anything
else,
anything
else
but
this
and
they're
going
to
put
me
in
jail
and
they're
going
to
take
away
my
livelihood.
i
have
the
right
to
be
confronted
by
the
witness.
now,
why
wouldn't
a
neighbor
in
those
circumstances
be
just
as
much
required
to
confront
the
person
whom
he
accuses
and
subject
himself
to
cross-examination?
i
think
it's
not
just
as
simple
as
that
one
undercover
man
that
you
speak
of.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rauh.
