these
documents
were
what

justice

mr.
rauh
as
to
your
point
four
i
think
it
was,
fact
four,
that
all
of
these
informants
were
casual
informants
as
contrasted
to
professional
ones,
this
appears
you
say
from
the
synopsis?
justice
potter
stewart
on
this
i
am
really
way
off
on
the
subject
of
where
you
are
now
in
your
argument,
i'm
curious
about
this,
when
these
people
were
hired,
is
there
any
indication
to
them
at
all
of
the
possibility
of
this
kind
of
a
--
their
losing
their
jobs
for
this
kind
of
a
program.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
board
didn't
either.
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
know
as
to
have
any
possible
relationship
or
in
law
--
justice

stewart
mr.
rauh,
aren't
you
using
a
little
bit
two
concepts
and
perhaps
misunderstanding
what
i
understood
the
solicitor
to
say.
he
said
these
findings
are
wiped
out.
he
wasn't
suggesting
that
this
evidence
had
been
taken
out
and
burned
and
thrown
in
a
waste
basket
or
the
garbage
can
but
that
the
findings
based
on
the
evidence
had
been
wiped
out.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
