mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioner
instituted
this
suit
in
this
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
release
against
the
action
of
the
defense
department
in
finding
him
a
security
risk
and
denying
him
access
to
classified
information
without
allowing
him
to
confront
the
secret
informants
on
whose
statements
the
defense
department's
action
against
him
was
predicated.
petitioner
is
here
on
certiorari
from
a
decision
of
the
district
court
dismissing
petitioner's
complaint.
turning
to
the
facts,
we
respectfully
submit
and
we
shall
seek
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
even
the
barest
outline
of
the
facts
will
make
clear
that
petitioner
presents
to
this
court
a
terrifying
480-page
record
of
injustice
and
far
and
away
the
most
perfect
example
of
the
inherent
and
inevitable
unfairness
of
non-confrontation
yet
presented
to
this
court
in
any
area.
petitioner
was
a
lathe
operator
at
bell
aircraft
from
1941
to
1956.
since
bell
makes
airplanes
the
industrial
security
program
applied
to
the
confidential
secret
and
top
secret
information
which
bell
received
in
order
to
manufacture
airplanes
for
the
government.
mr.
taylor,
the
petitioner,
had
a
confidential
clearance
to
carry
on
his
work
at
bell.
in
1956,
bell,
the
employer,
sought
a
secret
clearance
for
the
petitioner
from
the
defense
department.
in
september
1956,
bell,
the
employer,
received
a
notice
from
the
defense
department,
suspending
all
clearance
of
petitioner
and
immediately
he
was
discharged
by
bell.
very
shortly
thereafter
petitioner
received
charges
from
the
defense
department.
this
is
1956
and
petitioner
was
charged
with
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1942
and
1943
and
the
charges
went
on
you
may
still
be
a
member.
he
immediately
added
a
categorical
denial,
asked
for
a
hearing
and
asked
to
have
the
witnesses
who
charged
him
with
membership
in
1942
and
1943
and
may
still
be
a
member,
to
be
produced
for
cross
examination.
in
november
1956,
we
had
the
so
called
hearing.
the
government
produced
nothing.
no
witnesses,
no
evidence,
no
names
of
the
people
who
had
made
the
statement
about
mr.
taylor,
but
that
isn't
all
and
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
page
131
of
the
record
because
i
will
refer
to
this
again.
in
the
fifth
line
at
page
131,
the
chairman
of
the
board
assumes
that
mr.
taylor
is
guilty.
he
says
at
this
time
it
is
our
intention
and
the
statement
of
reasons
would
indicate
to
consider
that
these
documents,
namely
the
communist
party
card
and
the
communist
party
transfer
card
with
which
he
is
accused
of
having,
exist.
well
petitioner
had
no
choice
but
to
go
on.
here
he
was
before
a
board
that
wouldn't
tell
him
who
the
witnesses
were
against
him
assumed
his
guilt,
but
he
had
no
choice
but
to
try
to
prove
his
innocence.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
alleged
communist
party
membership
card
and
the
alleged
communist
party
transfer
card.
when
you
go
--
apparently
when
you
go
for
a
one
unit
to
another
there
is
a
transfer
card
and
this
was
alleged
against
him.
the
chairman
of
the
board
apparently
assumed
that
these
existed
even
though
they
have
been
categorically
denied
under
oath
by
petitioner.
well
petitioner
did
the
only
thing
a
human
being
could
do
under
those
circumstances
he
tried
to
prove
the
negative.
he
tried
to
prove
the
negative
of
what
had
happened
13
and
14
years
before.
he
testified
under
oath
that
he
had
never
been
a
member
of
the
party,
never
paid
dues,
never
been
to
meetings,
never
done
any
of
the
things
and
never
had
these
cards.
and
11
witnesses
from
bell
aircraft
came
to
support
him.
now
your
honors
will
recall
that
in
1942
and
1943
america
was
at
war
on
the
same
side
as
russia
and
the
workers,
the
communist
workers
had
a
particular
party
line
against
strikes,
because
they
would
hold
up
production
to
help
russia
and
for
incentive
pay
because
that
would
give
more
production.
and
seven
of
these
11
witnesses
testified
on
behalf
of
petitioner
that
he
opposed
the
no
strike
pledge
and
that
he
opposed
the
incentive
pay.
in
other
words,
if
your
honors
please
mr.
taylor
did
what
i
would
have
thought
was
impossible,
which
was
to
refute
overwhelmingly
the
secret
charges
against
him,
but
the
board
saw
it
differently.
seven
months
later
in
june
1957
the
board
issued
its
first
adverse
decision
to
mr.
taylor.
they
said
it
is
true
as
charged
that
you
were
a
communist
party
member
in
1942
and
1943
despite
all
this
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
without
producing
one
shred
of
evidence
themselves
and
you
may
still
be.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir,
on
page
52
if
your
honor
please
of
the
record,
there
is
an
order
saying
that
the
charges
were
true
as
stated,
it's
on
page
52.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
was
out
of
employment
practically
completely
from
september
1956
until
december
31,
1958
to
which
i
will
come
at
a
later
period.
his
loss
of
employment
and
livelihood
was
as
the
record
shows,
he
had
been
earning
about
$5,000
and
he
was
averaging
about
a
$1,000,
he
was
20%
employable
as
a
result
of
this.
now
after
this
adverse
decision
in
1952
and
1957,
petitioner
appealed
to
the
secretary,
it's
not
clear
that
he
had
to,
you
couldn't
tell
from
the
regulations
whether
this
was
necessary
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies,
but
in
an
abundance
of
caution
we
did
appeal
to
the
secretary.
nothing
happened.
we
waited
five
months
hoping
for
action
and
then
we
brought
suit
in
the
district
court.
in
april
1958
two
months
later,
the
government
said
to
us,
our
original
decision
was
reasonable
supported
but
we're
going
to
have
a
new
proceeding
anyway.
even
though
we
were
right
the
first
time,
we're
going
to
have
a
new
proceeding
now.
and
they
gave
us
new
charges,
the
so
called
amended
charges
and
look
at
what
happened.
the
new
charges
said
you
were
a
communist
party
member
in
1942
and
1943
but
you
were
expelled
in
1943.
they
took
our
defense,
which
was
that
he
had
opposed
the
communist
party
line
and
turned
it
around
and
said
why
you
were
expelled
for
opposing
the
communist
party
line.
what
they
had
found
as
true
in
1957
namely
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
in
1942
and
1943,
and
may
still
be,
they
now
found
he
was
a
member
of
--
they
charged,
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
in
1942
and
1943
and
was
expelled
in
1943.
and
it
wasn't
at
this
moment
and
it
wasn't
until
later
that
we
learned
that
the
secret
informants
who
first
said
he
may
still
be
a
member
of
the
party
down
to
date
had
tailored
their
stories
to
show
that
he
had
been
expelled
and
gave
us
the
reason,
his
own
defense
at
the
first
hearing.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
when
the
synopsis
of
the
confidential
informant's
reports
were
put
in
at
the
subsequent
hearing
to
which
i
will
come
right
now.
after
the
amended
reasons
were
given,
petitioner
made
a
second
categorical
denial,
a
second
request
for
confrontation
and
we
had
a,
again
so
called
hearing.
well
there
was
a
hearing
in
july
and
there
was
no
confrontation
and
there
was
a
hearing
in
august
and
there
was
no
confrontation.
but
in
august
of
1958
the
board
told
us
the
synopsis
of
what
the
confidential
informant
had
said.
and
if
you
will
look
on
page
102
of
the
record,
you
will
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
the
secret
informants
had
tailored
their
stories
to
rationalize
what
the
witnesses
had
said
at
the
first
hearing.
chairman
waldman
on
page
102
states
these
confidential
sources,
and
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
the
page,
he
refers
to
taylor
being
reproved
and
finally
expelled
for
making
public
statements
against
the
incentive
pay
and
in
favor
of
a
strike
policy,
that
the
matter
had
turned
full
circle.
the
informants
had
been
coached
to
utilize
the
very
material
which
petitioner
and
his
witnesses
had
gotten,
had
given
at
the
first
hearing.
and
if
your
honors
please,
there
is
not
line
in
the
government's
brief,
not
one
line
in
anyway
challenging
the
statement
of
facts
which
i
have
given
you,
even
though
every
one
of
them
appears
in
full
in
our
brief.
furthermore
this
same
synopsis
show
that
these
men,
the
secret
informants,
were
not
professional
undercover
agents
but
were
casual
informants
and
the
government
concedes
this
by
trial.
furthermore
this
shows
that
these
people
were
unseen
by
the
board,
in
other
words
this
is
not
a
case
of
where
board
knew
what
we
didn't
know,
and
the
government
concedes
this.
despite
this
on
october
13th
we
received
our
second
adverse
decision.
this
time
the
board
said,
having
previously
said
you
were
a
member
and
may
still
be,
now
they
said
you
were
a
member,
but
you
were
expelled.
but
that
wasn't
enough,
they
went
on
and
in
the
first
civil
administrative
finding
of
guilt
of
perjury
that
i
have
seen,
they
said
you
gave
false
and
misleading
information
deliberately
and
willfully
when
you
told
us
you
had
not
been
a
member
of
the
party.
on
october
14th,
the
next
day,
our
motion
for
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
came
on
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
dismissed
our
complaint
on
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
greene,
that
there
was
no
justiciable
controversy,
i
might
mention
at
this
point
that
the
government
now
concedes
the
error
of
that,
that
there
is
standing
to
sue
by
both
petitioner
greene
and
petitioner
taylor.
however
at
that
time
the
government
was
maintaining
there
was
no
standing
to
sue,
the
district
court
accepted
that
and
did
dismiss
our
compliant
because
the
greene
case
was
pending
here.
we
brought
certiorari.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
december
15th.
now,
if
i
may
just
state
a
summary
of
the
six
admitted
facts
are
controverted
by
the
government's
brief,
one
word
and
not
i
am
sure
to
be
controverted
by
the
solicitor
general
here
this
afternoon,
six
admitted
and
conceded
facts.
first
the
petitioner
was
twice
found
a
security
risk,
with
the
loss
of
job,
livelihood
and
reputation
on
the
basis
of
accusations
of
secret
informants
without
one
shred
of
evidence
ever
having
been
produced
anywhere
against
him.
two
that
the
first
charge
that
petitioner
had
been
a
communist
and
maybe
still
be
was
answered
overwhelmingly
by
12
witnesses,
11
plus
petitioner,
but
he
was
found
guilty.
three,
that
the
second
charge
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
first
charge,
the
petitioner
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
had
been
expelled,
was
based
on
tailored
stories,
and
yet
he
was
found
guilty
again.
fourth,
that
the
secret
informants
were
casual
informants
and
not
professional
agents.
fifth,
that
the
board
never
saw
these
secret
informants,
did
not
know
their
identities
or
anything
about
them.
six,
that
the
board
relied
as
a
synopsis
on
page
102
of
the
record
show,
they
relied
on
second,
third
and
fourth
degree
hearsay.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
submit
that
--
in
this
so
called
hearing
the
government
cross
examines
but
provides
nothing.
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
here
is
that
the
government
took
our
defense
and
in
some
way
the
informants
then
turned
around
and
used
our
defense
against
us.
we
were
always
available
for
cross
examination
and
there
is
a
long
cross
examination
in
the
record,
almost
50
pages
of
mr.
taylor
and
it
shows
only
the
honesty
of
his
answers.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
a
study
of
the
--
it
appears
in
three
ways
if
your
honor
please
from
the
study
of
synopsis,
from
our
request
to
the
board
that
they
tell
us
and
their
refusal
which
i
think
was
a
refusal
to
answer
was
practically
an
admission
because
it
wouldn't
have
shown
anything
of
great
security
to
have
told
us,
and
finally
from
the
government
we
make
this
assertion,
i
do
not
deny
it,
i
do
not
think
this
is
an
issue
nor
will
mr.
rankin,
question
that
i
could
be
wrong,
but
he
did
not
question
it
in
his
brief
after
we
had
asserted
it
twice
categorically.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
if
your
honor
please.
the
board
did
change
during
the
course
of
the
hearing,
but
if
the
opening
of
the
hearing
i
believe
transcript,
i
think
it
will
be
on
page
125.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
is
on
page
125
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now,
these
are
the
admitted
facts.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
this
argument
this
afternoon
is
like
shadowboxing.
we've
filed
a
brief
with
these
facts
in
it
and
we
argue
the
merits
on
these
facts
and
the
government
refused
to
respond
to
our
brief.
now
let
me
make
this
bluntly
clear.
here
is
a
petitioner
before
this
court,
asking
this
court's
relief
and
the
government
refuses
to
respond
on
the
merits.
in
a
sentence
the
government
said,
will
the
supreme
court
kindly
read
our
brief
in
another
case
on
different
facts,
which
maybe
totally
inapplicable,
and
therefore
i
suggest
that
it
is
in
a
sense
shadowboxing
to
have
to
argue
this
afternoon
without
the
benefit
of
a
meeting
brief.
now
i
say
to
your
honors
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
government
is
unwilling
to
defend
the
conduct
which
i
have
described,
which
it
has
conceded,
but
what
is
surprising,
and
to
me
a
little
sad,
is
that
the
government
is
unwilling
to
confess
the
error
action
which
it
is
also
unwilling
to
defend,
but
taking
our
argument
and
putting
it
up
against
the
government's
brief
in
greene,
i
come
now
to
the
issue
of
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
you
can
put
it
either
way
it
seems
to
me.
you
can
put
it
as
an
absolute
or
as
a
relative
standard
of
due
process
of
law.
we
do
it
both
ways
in
our
brief;
first
as
an
absolute
standard
and
second
as
a
relative
standard,
and
show
in
both
instances
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
petitioner's
liberty
and
property
without
due
process
of
law.
adverting
first
to
the
absolute
standard,
we
deal
with
this
at
pages
20
to
26
of
our
brief
and
i
believe
we
demonstrate
that
this
court
has
consistently
held
confrontation
to
be
a
minimum
requirement
of
the
due
process
imposed
on
governmental
action
affecting
substantial
interests.
now
it
is
hard
for
anyone
to
controvert
the
substantial
interest
here,
his
job,
his
livelihood
and
his
reputation,
the
interest
as
substantial
as
any
that
a
human
being
can
have.
as
we
read
wyman
and
slochower,
a
man
is
protected
even
in
government
employment,
against
arbitrary
dismissal
and
arbitrary
action.
private
employment,
where
the
government
cuts
across
that,
would
seem
to
be
an
obviously
a
fortiori
situation,
and
that
our
case
shows
a
denial
of
due
process
many
times
worse
and
many
times
clearer
than
wyman
and
slochower.
now
what
does
the
government
say
in
answer
to
this?
they
have
to
distinguish
these
cases
some
way
and
this
is
their
argument.
they
say
that
wyman
and
slochower
were
not
due
process
fair
procedure
cases,
but
were
discrimination
cases.
they
say
that
there
is
a
different
right
of
discrimination
against
discrimination
than
there
is
against
arbitrary
procedure.
the
government
suggests
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
protects
one's
life,
liberty
and
property
against
due
process
is
more
limited
in
its
due
process
provisions
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
its
equal
protection
provisions,
and
this
is
their
argument
why
slochower
and
wyman
don't
apply,
but
if
your
honors
please
the
court
held
otherwise.
mr.
justice
clark's
opinions
are
perfectly
clear
that
those
were
due
process
questions
that
mr.
justice
clark
was
dealing
within
in
the
slochower
and
wyman
cases.
there
was
nothing
discriminatory
about
what
happened
to
slochower.
the
court
held
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
and
furthermore,
even
if
one
were
to
accept
that
there
was
some
difference
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
i
cannot
see
and
which
the
solicitor
general
hasn't
pointed
out,
the
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
been
the
exact
reverse.
the
question
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
whether
discrimination
has
been
covered
at
all
by
the
due
process
clause,
whether
equal
protection
really
was
a
part
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
yet
the
government
says
that
the
only
thing
we
should
consider
in
the
fifth
amendment,
the
dominant
factor
is
the
due
process
clause,
it
is
the
discriminatory
aspect.
well
if
your
honors
please,
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
applying
a
relative
standard
here.
we
have
a
substantial
interest.
we
have
an
arbitrary
action.
we
have
non-confrontation.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
we
submit
that
our
case
is
proved.
but,
since
the
government
argues
the
relative
standard,
that
is
the
need
of
the
individual
for
confrontation
against
the
need
of
the
government
for
secrecy,
we
are
happy
to
argue
it
because
we
do
not
feel
that
the
situation
could
be
any
different,
under
a
relative
than
under
an
absolute
concept.
the
government
says,
let's
have
a
weighing
here.
let's
weight
the
need
of
the
individual
against
the
need
of
the
government,
all
right
let's
weigh
them.
we
submit
first,
that
in
the
first
half
of
this
equation,
the
denial
of
confrontation
in
security
matters
renders
them
inevitable,
unfair
and
arbitrary,
and
i
use
the
word
inevitable
advisably,
and
i
ask
your
honors
at
some
stage
to
examine
pages
29
to
38
of
our
brief,
where
we
show
the
inevitable
character
of
unfairness
in
non-confrontation
in
security
matters.
let
me
just
advert
briefly
to
five
points
that
make
it
inevitably
unfair;
first
the
lapse
of
time.
you
can't
get
witnesses
to
testify
to
42
and
43
to
answer
every
charge.
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
the
man
who
makes
the
charge
from
42
and
43
and
show
that
he
can't
remember.
confrontation
is
important
first
therefore
because
of
the
lapse
of
time.
secondly
the
nature
of
the
charges,
these
are
charges
of
covert
and
suspect
activities,
you
can't
get
people
and
we
don't
have
subpoena
power,
the
government
hasn't
provided
this
program
with
a
subpoena
power,
you
can't
get
people
to
come
in
and
admit
their
covert
and
suspect
activities.
you've
got
to
get
the
accuser
and
try
and
break
the
story
down
at
that
stage
and
thirdly
there
is
the
danger
of
false
accusations.
i
do
not
need
to
tell
this
court
about
false
accusers
in
this
area.
mr.
matusow,
mr.
crouch,
mr.
johnson
and
mr.
maezi,
all
clutter
up
the
books,
the
records
before
this
court.
they
would
men
liars
under
oath,
think
what
damage
was
done
these
men
as
secret
informers
against
people
who
never
saw
them,
and
this
very
case,
and
that's
the
reason
i
stress
this
so
much
at
the
beginning,
in
this
very
case
you
have
witnesses,
secret
informers
who
coached
to
change
their
stories,
then
bring
in
a
new
story
which
reconciles
petitioner's
defense
at
his
first
hearing.
fourth,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant,
how
can
you
meet
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
your
innocence
if
you
can't
get
at
the
people
who
charge
you,
and
fifth,
and
this
in
some
ways
is
the
worst.
this
is
the
reductio
ad
absurdum
of
this
program.
the
boards
never
see
these
people.
now
just,
what
does
the
board
have
in
(inaudible).
it
has
12
people
swearing
to
this
man's
innocence
and
it
has
a
sheet
of
paper
on
the
other
side.
it
has
to
weigh
a
sheet
of
paper
against
testimony.
you
cannot
weigh
a
sheet
of
paper
against
testimony
and
the
proof
is
you
cannot
weigh
it
is
why
i
asked
your
honors
to
look
at
page
131
of
the
record.
you
assume,
the
board
in
this
kind
of
a
weighing
process,
assumes
guilt,
either
the
paper
is
right
or
its
wrong,
there
is
no
way
to
compare
the
paper
against
the
oral
witnesses,
so
what
does
the
board
do?
right
at
the
outset
they
assume
that
the
paper
was
right.
the
paper
i'm
referring
to
was
his
statement
that
the
--
which
was
a
report
from
the
intelligence
agency
saying
there
was
a
communist
party
card
and
a
communist
party
transfer
card.
so
what
does
he
do?
he
assumes
that
that's
true,
you
can
no
more
weigh
12
honest
and
honorable
witnesses
against
the
sheet
of
paper
from
an
intelligence
agency
than
a
mathematician
can
count
up
apples
and
pears.
they
have
no
relationship.
it
makes
the
hearing
impossible.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
that
government
will
concede
that,
it
was
in
our
brief.
first
if
your
honor
please
we
ask
the
question,
did
you
see
any,
they
refused
to
answer
that
and
i
think
that
was
a
remission
against
interest.
second
the
synopsis
rather
indicates
they
are
so
limited
that
it
seems
unlikely
that
they
could
have
seen
them.
in
the
third
place
we
charge
this,
we
assert
this
as
a
fact
and
the
government
has
made
no
suggestion,
i
believe
mr.
rankin
will
assure
your
honors
that
they
did
not
see
the
secret
informants.
now
everything
we
learned
from
foreign
books
about
the
value
of
cross
examination.
these
are
100
times
more
applicable
in
the
security
area,
just
because
of
the
kind
of
factors
that
i
have
mentioned,
but
the
government
says
okay
so
it's
bad,
but
we
have
an
interest
too.
we
have
an
interest
in
the
secrecy
of
the
undercover
informants.
now
i
think
your
honors
would
all
agree
and
i
think
mr.
rankin
would
agree
that
their
burden
here
is
gigantic.
with
a
system
this
unfair
their
burden
would
be
tremendous
to
show
their
need,
but
i
say
to
your
honors
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
that
mr.
taylor
was
employed
at
bell
aircraft
before
the
program
if
your
honor
please
so
that
he
could
not
have
--
i
do
not
know
the
details
of
how
that
operates
for
people
in
the
future.
i
would
say
with
assurance
that
mr.
taylor
was
never
given
any
such
indications.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
he
had
the
usual
protections
that
you
would
have,
seniority
and
they
would
have
to
be
just
cause
and
all
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
not
under
our
union
contract,
but
he
would
have
to
have
just
cause
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you
would
have
to
have
just
cause,
if
he
had
just
cause,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
but
the
union
has
accepted
this
as
just
cause,
where
the
government
action,
we've
found
the
union
is
defending
mr.
taylor,
but
they
accepted
his
just
cause,
if
the
court
should
hold
that
it's
just
proceeding.
now
may
i
just
say
to
mr.
frankfurter
that
the
question
of
the
contract,
it's
quite
true
that
the
contract
is
at
will,
other
than
between
union
relationships,
but
the
contract
is
satisfactory
to
both
parties,
in
other
words
the
government
cuts
across
the
contract
which
is
satisfactory
to
both
parties
and
as
to
which
no
party
claims
that
there
is
any
reason
for
the
discharge
except
the
governmental
action.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
certainly.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
now
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
this
unfair
proceeding
is
necessary
we
say
to
your
honors
they
have
no
right
to
come
into
this
court
room
and
tell
you
this
program
is
necessary
because
they've
never
tried
the
alternative.
there
is
a
simple
alternative
and
the
simple
alternative
is
to
use
secret
informants
the
way
you
use
them
in
every
other
part
of
our
law.
we
are
not
against
the
use
of
secret
informants.
it's
a
proper
and
appropriate
way
to
get
leads
to
have
witnesses.
that's
what
we
do
everyday
in
every
criminal
court.
that's
what
you
do
everyday
in
every
administrative
procedure.
why
should
it
be
different
here?
the
government
says
it's
different
because
of
security
needs,
yet
they've
never
tried
it
and
this
is
a
point
if
i
make
nothing
else
clear
i
would
like
to
make
clear
this
afternoon,
that
the
government
is
asking
you
to
take
their
word
for
it,
they
are
asking
you
to
say
that
no
other
system
would
work
even
though
they
have
been
unwilling
to
attempt
to
any
other
system.
they
haven't
gone
out
and
asked
congress
for
a
subpoena
power
to
make
this
system
work.
they
haven't
ever
tried
this
system.
and
i
suggest
that
this
is
a
system
based
not
on
security
necessity
but
on
administrative
convenience.
it's
easier,
it's
easier
simply
to
use
the
secret
informants,
but
there
has
been
no
showing
that
the
other
system
won't
work,
because
it's
never
been
tried.
now
if
your
honors
please,
these
are
by
governmental
admission
and
our
deduction
from
the
record
but
primarily
i
think
it's
simpler
to
take
the
governmental
admission
casual
informants,
not
undercover
agents.
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
different
if
they
were
professional
fbi
agents.
but
as
i
--
when
i
was
arguing
the
(inaudible)
case
it
was
suggested
i
was
carrying
more
water
on
my
shoulders
than
necessary,
i'm
not
going
to
do
that
this
afternoon.
these
were
casual
informants.
every
observer
of
this
program
has
suggested
that
the
casual
informants
not
be
treated
as
secret
informants,
that
they
be
confronted,
that
they
be
used
as
witnesses,
and
i
ask
particularly
if
your
honors
will
examine
these
at
pages
42
to
46
of
our
brief,
the
government
--
the
commission
on
government
security,
mr.
wild
bill
--
the
late
wild
bill
donovan
and
an
expert
in
this
area,
the
johnson
committee,
the
commission
of
the
association
of
the
bar,
every
single
expert
who
has
looked
into
this
says
there
is
no
reason
for
protection
of
these
casual
informants.
and
there
is
another
man
i
want
to
refer
to
because
i
find
it
even
as
significant
as
those
and
that's
a
former
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states.
on
page
44
of
our
brief
we
quote
mr.
furman.
mr.
furman
stood
before
this
court
where
i
stand
eight
years
ago
and
persuaded
the
court
four
to
four
to
keep
the
confrontation
system,
the
non-confrontation
system
in
effect
through
the
bailey
case.
mr.
furman
had
subsequent
reason
to
feel
that
he
had
been
wrong
in
urging
this
court
to
take
that
action.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
the
other
side,
on
the
other
side,
here
you
have
a
unanimous
opinion
and
what
does
the
government
give
us
as
showing
of
need
on
the
other
side?
well
if
you'll
look
at
greene
brief,
the
government's
brief
in
greene
there
is
just
one
thing
they
tell
this
court,
just
one
thing,
the
fbi
said
so.
that
is
their
only
reason
to
this
court
and
let
me
--
i
don't
make
that
charge
lightly.
if
you
look
at
page
67
of
the
government's
brief
in
greene,
at
the
middle
of
the
page
it
refers
to
the
need
for
disclosure.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
67
if
your
honor
please,
they
refer
to
the
need
for
non-disclosure
and
they
quote
mr.
richardson
who
was
the
first
head
of
the
loyalty
review
board,
but
mr.
richardson
had
said,
he
himself
had
started
the
loyalty
review
board
with
non-confrontation
reluctantly
and
only
under
the
insistence
of
the
fbi
and
then
if
you'll
turn
over
to
page
68
of
the
greene
brief,
i
would
like
to
address
your
attention
to
the
authorities
on
which
the
government
relies,
see
also
hoover
in
syracuse
law
review,
hoover
in
the
yale
law
journal
and
then
hearings
before
the
sub-committee,
we
looked
this
up,
that
was
mr.
hoover,
hearings
before
a
subcommittee
that
was
mr.
hoover.
now
i
don't
know
just
how
to
--
exactly
to
say
this,
but
i
would
make
the
suggestion
in
all
deference
that
this
court
cannot
let
america's
chief
policeman
decide
that
the
bill
of
rights
won't
work.
we
have
been
very
careful
to
bring
in
here
in
our
brief
every
observer
of
this
program
and
they
have
been
unanimous,
that
we
must
get
away
from
this
non-confrontation
and
i
do
not
as
i
said
before
think
anybody
can
say
that.
now,
if
your
honors
please
i
respectfully
submit
that
whether
you
treat
the
due
process
standard
as
relative
or
absolute,
we
have
met
it
and
that
there
has
been
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
having
said
that
much
i
have
to
confess
that
i
do
not
think
the
point
will
be
reached
in
the
case.
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
has
shown
a
statutory
base
or
a
constitutional
base
for
what
has
occurred
here.
if
i
may
--
there
are
two
different
reasons
why
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
statutory
basis
for
this
program.
in
our
brief
at
pages
50
to
56
we
demonstrate
that
whatever
statutes
the
government
rely
on
for
this
program
are
equally
consistent
with
confrontation
as
with
non-confrontation,
and
therefore
obviously
this
court
is
going
to
take
the
confrontation
interpretation
when
so
serious
a
constitutional
issue
arises.
the
government
in
their
brief
makes
no
answer
to
this
at
all.
the
government
does
not
challenge
anywhere
in
their
brief
our
point
three
pages
50
to
56
that
the
statutes
if
there
are
any
setting
up
this
program
should
be
interpreted
as
providing
for
confrontation.
there
is
another
statutory
point
which
was
primarily
stressed
by
my
brother
berueffy
in
his
case,
the
greene
case.
we
primarily
stress
the
point
that
the
statutory
base,
whatever
it
was,
is
equally
consistent
with
confrontation
and
non
confrontation.
he
primarily
stressed
the
point
that
there
wasn't
any
statutory
base
at
all.
and
the
government
practically
concedes
that.
i
use
the
word
practically
because
it's
not
--
they
do
not
concede
it
in
so
many
words,
but
on
page
26
of
the
government's
brief
in
greene
they
appear
to
say,
well
it's
inherent
power
or
nothing.
so
the
choice
it
seems
to
me
this
court
has
is
whether
to
say
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
non-confrontation
or
to
say
there
is
no
statutory
authority
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
choice
of
ground,
possibly
the
fact
that
the
government
completely
concedes
our
point
and
only
partially
concedes
the
other
one
would
make
the
point
i
have
suggested
in
our
brief
the
more
likely
one.
the
government
relies
on
something
wholly
different.
the
government
relies
on
the
inherent
executive
power.
mr.
rankin
is
proposing
to
this
court
that
the
government
be
allowed
to
have
a
program
for
screening
three
million
americans
that
affects
the
lives,
jobs,
livelihood,
reputation
of
all
these
people,
not
through
congress
but
through
some
power
of
the
president
as
executive
and
as
commander-in-chief.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
youngstown
(inaudible)
and
kent
cases
went
way
beyond
that.
if
the
ad
hoc
emergency
seizure
of
the
steel
mills
was
not
within
the
inherent
power
as
commander-in-chief,
certainly
a
permanent
screening
process
of
three
million
american
is
not
within
it,
but
here
too
i
don't
think
the
court
will
ever
reach
this
point.
no
president
has
ever
asserted
this
power.
there
is
no
delegation
of
authority
from
the
president
to
the
defense
department
asserting
this
power.
this
court
is
being
asked
today
to
decide
an
inherent
executive
power
which
the
executive
has
never
said
he
asserts,
certainly
on
the
same
principle
of
one
does
not
decide
a
constitutional
issue
if
statutory
constructions
will
make
possible
its
avoidance,
so
one
does
not
decide
the
inherent
power
exists
if
the
president
himself
has
not
made
abundantly
clear
that,
that
power
is
there
and
that
he
asserts
it.
there
is
not
a
word
presented
to
this
court
evidencing
that
any
president
of
the
united
states
has
ever
suggested
that
he
has
this
inherent
executive
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
does
the
government
rely
on?
it's
very
high
to
say
your
honor,
the
paper
that's
before
your
honors
is
a
thing
called
supplemental
memorandum
for
the
respondents,
the
last
document
filed
on
march
24th
which
contains
the
regulations
under
which
this
proceeding
is
had,
there
is
not
word
about
inherent
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
three
years
your
honor.
as
far
as
i
know
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
well
this
is
--
includes
some
amendments
of
that
your
honor,
it
has
the
old
regulation.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
absolutely
not,
now
if
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
closest
thing
to
that
first
to
that
is
in
the
supplemental
memorandum
for
the
respondents
on
page
five,
section
4
called
release
of
information,
the
second
sentence
says
no
classified
information.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
page
five,
the
paragraph
four,
the
second
sentence,
no
classified
information
or
any
information
which
might
compromise
investigative
sources
or
methods
or
the
identity
of
confidential
informants
will
be
disclosed
to
any
contractor
or
employee.
that
is
their
base
for
this,
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
robert
stevens,
secretary
of
the
army,
cs
thomas
secretary
of
the
navy,
h.e.
talbott
secretary
of
the
air
force,
cu
wilson
secretary
of
defense.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
do
not
but
the
government
cites
at
page
27
of
the
greene
brief
in
executive
order
10501
which
as
the
authority,
which
i
state,
which
i
respectfully
submit
is
totally
irrelevant,
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
is
at
page
27
of
the
government's
brief
in
greene,
executive
order
10501,
which
refers
to
the
classification
and
protection
of
information
and
never
makes
the
slightest
reference
to
any
type
of
program
such
as
this.
now
if
your
honors
please,
the
government
has
conceded
our
standing
to
sue.
therefore,
there
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
any
serious
jurisdictional
issues
to
the
issuance
of
a
decree
in
our
favor.
however,
the
government
makes
another
point.
the
government
claims
that
this
case
is
moot
and
i
most
respectfully
submit
that
this
case
is
not
moot
unless
the
government
can
play
fast
and
lose
with
this
court's
process.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
december
15.
on
december
31st
the
government
gave
petitioner
what
they
euphemistically
referred
to
as
clearance.
they
didn't
say
he
was
not
a
security
risk.
they
didn't
make
their
usual
finding
that
he
was
being
cleared
in
the
national
security.
they
made
no
findings
that
the
charges
against
weren't
true.
the
simply
cleared
him
"in
the
national
interest."
this
was
december
31st
two
weeks
after
this
court
granted
certiorari.
on
january
9th
the
government
filed
a
suggestion
of
mootness
saying
well
we've
cleared
him
so
it's
all
over.
we
filed
our
answer
on
january
28th
and
we
pointed
out
there
was
grave
likelihood
of
recurrence.
we've
pointed
that
the
mere
cessation
doesn't
stop,
take
away
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
if
there
is
a
likelihood
that
it
can
happen
again
and
we
pointed
out
that
under
these
security
programs
there
is
a
continuous
screening,
that
people,
the
decision
change
on
people
all
the
time,
and
we've
pointed
all
this
out
in
our
opposition.
then
on
february
13th
the
government
filed
a
memorandum
in
reply
and
they
changed
their
story
completely.
they
practically
admitted
that
the
mere
clearance
under
this
strange
way
of
clearing
was
not
enough
to
render
this
case
moot,
but
they
said
we've
got
a
change
in
our
whole
method
of
operation
which
will
protect
this
man.
we
demurrer,
we
say
let's
assume
he
is
perjurious
ex-communist.
let's
assume
he
was
a
communist
in
1942
and
1943.
let's
assume
he
was
expelled,
let's
assume
he
lied
about
this
as
late
as
1957
and
is
lying
now.
nevertheless
we
will
clear
him
for
the
job
of
lathe
operator.
that's
exactly
what
the
government's
february
13th
memorandum
says,
he
may
have
access
to
secret
information,
but
as
a
lathe
operator
rather
than
a
supervisor
well
we'll
keep
him
in.
well
in
our
response,
we
threw
a
little
skepticism
about
whether
this
program
was
in
effect,
whether
they
really
were
going
to
take
everybody's
job.
well
we
also
said
if
it
isn't
effect
it's
worse
for
us
because
it
makes
the
likelihood
of
recurrence
much
greater
because
if
the
job
changes
one
inch,
if
there
is
most
secret
information
went
into
the
--
if
it's
a
new
type
of
aeroplane
or
if
he
got
a
different
job
it
would
only
make
the
recurrence
of
a
screening
program
even
more.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
clearance
for
a
particular
level
if
your
honor
please,
confidential
secret
or
top
secret,
that
has
always
been
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
if
your
honor
please
he
is
under
question
for
a
level
of
clearance,
confidential
secret
or
top
secret,
as
i
was
about
to
come
to,
that
is
exactly
what
the
program
is,
was
and
is.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
have
to
go
back
to
if
i
may.
they
first
said
he
was
cleared
just
generally,
and
we
point
out
that
wasn't
so.
then
they
came
back
and
said
we
got
a
new
system
and
we
are
going
to
clear
him
for
a
job,
lathe
operator
and
we
showed
how
that
would
make
it
worse.
then
on
march
24th
the
government
filed
its
new
regulation
and
that
is
the
regulations
that
i
referred
to
your
honor
before
and
to
which
i
now
like
to
advert.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
mountain
has
brought
forth
a
mouse,
that
his
regulation
does
not
change
the
situation
as
it
was
on
march
23rd
one
iota.
now
if
your
honors
will
look
page
four
of
this
regulation,
may
i
first
say
that
this
regulation
contains
in
italics
the
changes
that
were
made
on
march
24th
and
in
plain
type
the
regulations
as
it
existed
before.
on
page
four,
just
before
the
last
sentence,
in
the
first
paragraph
c
there
reads
as
follows.
in
the
case
of
a
contractor
employee
a
clearance
is
an
approval
for
the
employee
to
have
access
to
specified
classes,
categories
of
classified
information
necessary
to
the
performance
of
his
work
with
a
particular
contractor.
now
if
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
words
there,
access
to
specified
categories
of
classified
information
refer
to
secret;
to
confidential,
secret
and
top
secret
and
when
i
say
that
the
mountain
has
brought
forth
a
mouse,
i
say
that
they
have
done
nothing
in
this
change
except
what
is
in
that
sentence.
they
have
taken
the
words
specified
categories
of
classified
information,
there
on
page
four
and
put
them
in
italics,
added
them
on
page
five
and
one
or
two
other
places.
in
other
words
what
the
government
has
done,
is
taken
the
present
system
which
always
calls
for
clearance,
confidential,
secret
or
top
secret,
and
made
that
clear
in
this
regulation,
where
if
i
respectfully
submit
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
it
was
always
clear
before.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
the
way
it
works
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
december
1956,
all
clearance
was
lifted
and
the
company
therefore
could
not
use
him
on
any
job
where
he
could
see
confidential
or
secret
or
top
secret
information.
the
company
had
no
other
job
and
discharged
him,
so
he
has
also,
it
also,
because
every
new
employer,
says
that
may
i
just
see
your
discharge
papers
from
the
old
job
and
it's
what
this
court
referred
to
in
wyman
as
the
badge
of
infamy,
it
just
is
a
different
way
of
getting
your
badge,
but
it's
the
same
thing
as
getting
it
in
the
other
fashion.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
have
to
answer
that
with
a
demurer.
the
government
in
filing
this
document
does
not
say
what
is
done
under
it,
if
your
honor
will
look
on
page
one
of
this
document
submitted
by
mr.
rankin,
he
says
in
the
brief
for
the
respondents,
note
there
was
pending
an
amendment,
which
would
require
the
level
of
classification
which
access
is
sought
be
taken
into
account,
he
doesn't
say
how
this
affects
petitioner's
case,
and
implies
that
this
wasn't
true
before.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
i
just
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
they
said
the
same
thing
in
the
earlier
--
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
they
can't
talk
about
this
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
nothing,
except
that
he
had
been
cleared.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
was
a
special
letter
written
for
the
purpose
of
taking
the
process
away
from
this
court,
that's
exactly
what
it
means.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct
if
your
honor
pleases,
but
no
other
suggestion
has
been
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
follow
the
question.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
gave
him
his
old
job
back,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
was
no
basis
given
for
this.
now
i
like
to
make
this
perfectly
clear,
because
the
whole
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor,
except
that
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
said
that
the
--
nothing
has
been
done
to
the
regulations,
that
what
i
--
that
is
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
clear.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
i
go
back
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
nothing
except
that,
but
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
i
am
willing
to
concede,
for
example
i
am
willing
to
concede
this
your
honor,
if
the
government
removed
everybody
over
40
years
of
age
from
the
program
and
cleared
him
because
of
that
reason,
the
case
would
be
moot.
still
what
i'm
trying
to
make
clear
is
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
all
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
all
right.
if
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
the
government
really
removed
this
man
from
the
program,
there
might
be
some
ground
for
saying
the
case
is
moot,
but
the
government
doesn't
remove
this
man
from
the
program.
this
man
could
have
a
case
started
against
him
tomorrow,
and
he
would
have
nothing
to
protect
him.
the
government
said
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
of
course.
but
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
certainly
not.
the
difference
between
that
man
and
mr.
taylor
is
that
mr.
taylor
was
found
guilty
for
two-and-a-half
years,
and
was
cleared
not
on
the
merits
as
the
case
you
gave
me,
but
was
cleared
without
reference
to
the
merits.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you'll
have
to
ask
if
may
suggest
mr.
rankin,
because
i
am
not
privy
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
privy
to
the
secrets
of
the
government,
i
can
only
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
did
not
give
this
man
the
clearance
that
other
person
under
this
program
has.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
said
that
before,
but
you
missed
it
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
the
national
security,
they
get
cleared
that
is
access
to
confidential
or
secret
or
top
secret
information,
to
classified
information,
is
consistent
with
the
national
security.
mr.
taylor,
without
the
findings
that
always
go
with
that
clearance,
was
found
he
is
cleared
in
the
national
interest
and
it
was
perfectly
clear,
and
the
government
said
this
themselves
in
their
reply
brief,
we
demur,
we
say
that
even
if
it's
all
true,
that
is
perjurist
ex-communist,
we're
going
to
let
him
be
a
lathe
operator.
but
then
they
turn
around
and
they
don't
put
that
program
into
effect.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
assert
this
in
our
brief
and
has
never
been
controverted
by
the
government.
now
if
your
honors
please
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
but
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
in
addition,
i
would
say
if
there
was
no
sinister
purpose
it
wouldn't
effect
it
anyway,
it
wouldn't
be
moot.
i
say
two
things
if
your
honor
please.
the
government
cleared
this
man
only
to
get
this
case
away
from
the
court,
that
has
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
all
right.
i
would
say
that
you
draw
however
from
the
fact
that
on
december
31st
when
he
was
cleared,
the
government
suggested
a
change
of
policy,
they
suggested
a
different
change
of
policy
on
february
13th
and
they
suggested
still
different
change
of
policy
on
march
24th.
it's
three
months
after
december
31st
when
this
man
was
“cleared”,
they
cannot
tell
you
why
he
is
cleared
and
why
is
there,
i
think
there
is
some
basis
for
the
deductions
are
suggestive.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
of
course
not,
there
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
the
government
made
certain
contentions
in
the
other
case
that
they
do
not
make
here
your
honor.
they
suggest
for
example
that
mr.
greene
made
certain
concessions
on
which
the
decision
could
have
been.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
but
although
i
have
suggested
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
hope
that
they
are
satisfactorily
raised.
the
government
however
took
a
different
position
in
the
other
case.
now
just
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
go
back
and
indicate
why
i
do
not
think
this
case
is
in
anyway
and
possibly
moot.
the
government
has
a
continuous
screening
program,
and
therefore
unless
something
has
been
shown,
which
would
remove
this
man
completely
from
the
program,
he
runs
the
risk
of
further
action.
having
gotten
to
this
court,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
a
government
which
still
claims
the
right
to
do
exactly
this,
namely
non-confrontation,
the
government
is
here
asserting
the
right
of
non-confrontation,
they
have
not
stopped
the
practice
we
are
trying
to
get
relief
against,
they
are
asserting
their
constitutional
right
to
continue
that
practice.
here
is
a
man,
as
to
whom
there
will
be
a
continuous
screening,
of
whom
there
is
a
continuous
screening
process,
who
has
never
been
exonerated,
who
only
a
few
months
ago
was
held
a
prejurious
ex-communist,
as
to
whom
the
government
can't
even
explain
why
was
cleared,
and
now
they
ask
your
honors
not
to
give
him
the
relief
for
which
he
has
sought
unless
the
government
is
different
from
a
private
party,
which
your
honors
for
example
in
grant
would
not
allow
to
stop
a
proceeding
by
refusing
to
--
by
changing
his
conduct.
if
the
government
--
unless
the
government
is
different
from
a
private
party,
unless
it
has
a
right
to
discontinue
temporarily
in
the
court,
not
look
at
the
likelihood
of
recurrence,
unless
the
government
is
wholly
different
from
anybody
else,
then
this
case
is
not
moot,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
anything
to
answer
on
the
merit.
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded.
i
believe
in
open
court
that
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
this
program.
he
has
argued
inherent
power
but
he
has
failed
to
show
this
court
an
executive
order
asserting
inherent
power
and
i
cannot
believe
it
consistent
with
the
principle
of
avoiding
constitutional
issues
this
court
will
decide
inherent
power
until
a
president
of
the
united
sates
under
whom
the
program
is
set
up,
asserts
the
power.
furthermore,
there
has
been
no
defense
of
the
facts
of
this
case
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
on
the
question
of
mootness.
the
question
boils
down
to
this.
is
petitioner
to
be
turned
away
from
the
courts
without
protection
against
future
recurrence
of
the
substantially
conceded
unauthorized
in
arbitrary
conduct
of
the
government?
now,
i
think
i
may
have
not
been
as
clear
yesterday
as
i
would
have
liked
to
have
been
and
may
have
confused
the
difference
between
a
request
--
a
suit
for
money
damages
and
a
suit
for
equitable
and
declaratory
relief.
in
a
suit
for
money
damages
where
payment
of
the
damages
is
made
in
full,
where
the
person
has
been
fully
compensated
then
of
course
the
case
is
moot.
in
however,
suit
for
equitable
and
declaratory
relief,
future
protection
is
as
significant
as
the
immediate
problem,
and
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
again
that
where
there
is
a
likelihood
of
recurrence
then
the
case
is
not
moot.
take
walling
against
helvering
where
the
man
stopped
his
wage
in
our
law
valuation.
take
the
grant
case
where
the
man
resigned
as
the
director.
unless
you're
going
to
say
it's
a
double
standard
and
the
government
can
stop
and
there's
no
--
and
there's
still
a
danger
of
recurrence
and
it's
different
with
a
private
party
but
this
court
rejected
the
double
standard
in
the
southern
pacific
terminal
case.
and
so,
we
get
back
to
this
fact,
is
there
a
likelihood
of
recurrence
and
to
that,
i
would
like
to
devote
the
remaining
time
here.
now,
mr.
rankin
suggested
this
morning
that
the
practice
is
to
wipe
this
information
clean
when
in
fact
a
man
is
cleared.
why
that
an
amazing
statement
really
in
this
court,
because
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
three
cases
proving
the
exact
opposite.
the
first
case,
of
course
was
peters
against
hobby
where
mr.
peters,
on
the
same
evidence,
the
same
evidence
in
which
he
was
cleared
with
was
subsequently
used
to
find
him
guilty
and
it
came
to
this
court.
the
case
of
mr.
service
which
came
to
the
court,
the
identical
evidence
had
found
him
clean
four
times,
was
used
the
fifth
time
to
find
him
guilty.
and
finally,
and
this
it
seems
to
me
has
the
most
complete
answer,
is
the
greene
case.
in
the
very
greene
case
the
same
evidence
--
the
case
is
only
here
because
the
same
evidence
which
once
was
used
to
find
him
innocent
was
later
used
to
find
him
guilty.
these
are
not
wiped
out
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
as
--
indeed
one
of
the
criticisms
of
the
program
by
so
many
of
the
students
has
been
the
fact
that
there
is
no
res
judicata,
that
the
same
materials
used
over
and
over
again.
in
our
opposition
for
example,
we
quote
the
new
york
city
fire
association
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
then
stand
corrected.
i
understood
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice
to
be
that
the
“evidence”
itself,
evidence
in
quotes
because
it's
equally
important
that
this
material
could
not
be
used
against.
i
so
understood
his
answers,
chief
justice,
if
i
missed
understood
the
answer,
i
then
would
be
willing
--
and
then
that's
fine.
we
all
agree
then
that
the
“evidence”
can
be
used
over
and
over
again
and
that's
all
i'm
trying
to
prove.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you
would
get
an
injunctive
relief
against
re
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you
can
get
it
as
i
was
trying
to
say
injunctive
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
is
--
we
sought
both
of
the
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
if
you
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
--
no,
your
honor.
that
--
at
any
future
procedure
that
was
gone
into,
it
would
follow
the
requirements
of
due
process.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
a
simple
statement
because
in
this
case
i
believe
your
honors
are
going
to
decide
there's
no
authorization
for
the
program
so
that
the
injunctive
relief
would
be
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
reversal
would
be
very
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
may
not.
i
suggested
yesterday
that
the
narrowest
ground
would
be
the
congress
hadn't
authorized
none
confrontation.
it
would
simply
be
an
injunction
for
the
future
that
the
non
--
at
future
hearings
involving
this
petitioner,
the
procedures
of
nonconfrontation
could
not
be
adopted.
this
would
be
all
the
protection
he
needs.
it
is
all
the
protection
for
which
we
here
plead.
now,
may
i
just
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
am
only
using
the
material
point
to
show
that
this
man
stands
in
danger
of
recurrence,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
he
wouldn't
stand
in
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
if
your
honor,
if
i
may,
say
that
that
what
the
future
hearing
we're
complaining
about
is
not
that
they
use
this
material
or
not.
it's
nonconfrontation.
and
what
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
we
are
seeking
is
the
fact
that
there
cannot
be
tomorrow
the
same
two
and
a
half
years
of
finding
him
guilty
without
confrontation.
and
i
am
showing
that
this
evidence
is
not
wiped
out.
that
they
use
it
over
and
over
again
to
reach
different
results
and
then
if
there
isn't
a
decree
of
this
court,
they
may
very
well
use
it
over
again
to
reach
the
opposite
result
without
confrontation
and
we
will
be
forced
to
come
up
to
this
court
through
district
court,
court
of
appeals,
supreme
court
at
the
risk
of
two
and
a
half
more
years
of
the
same
thing.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
sorry
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would
leave
--
it
will
change.
our
case
is
not
moot
because
there's
a
likelihood
of
recurrence.
if
the
court's
order,
thereby
completely
ends
the
program,
i
don't
think
that
renders
our
case
moot.
i
think
it
would
simply
mean
that
our
case
would
be
decided
as
part
of
the
other
case.
i
don't
see
how
your
action
in
one
case
can
render
our
case
moot
other
than
the
fact
the
decision
in
our
case
also,
by
the
same
token,
renders
the
other
case
moot.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
obviously,
your
decision
is
going
to
be
dispositive
of
--
of
both
causes
of
action.
now,
not
only
is
there
a
likelihood
of
recurrence
because
of
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
program
over
and
over
and
over
again
with
the
same
evidence
but
this
is
a
peculiar
situation.
mr.
rankin
informed
the
court
this
morning
that
they
would
not
make
findings
in
our
favor.
now,
they
always
--
now
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention.
if
you'll
look
at
the
supplemental
memorandum
with
the
regulations
in
them,
at
page
27,
there's
a
provision
for
making
findings
at
page
27-d.
now,
it's
true
that
this
says
that
the
hearing
board
shall
make
the
findings.
but
we
stand
without
the
findings
which
are
the
normal
protection.
i
would
say
this
case
isn't
moot.
if
we
had
gotten
everything
in
our
clearance,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
same
evidence
has
been
used
over
and
over
again
but
we
didn't
get
everything.
mr.
rankin,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
made
perfectly
clear.
they
were
refusing
us
affirmative
findings
which
would
be
a
minimum
protection
for
the
future.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
at
page
27
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
it's
always
been
for
clearance
finding.
in
every
case,
i
have
been
in,
there
have
been
clearance
findings.
in
every
single
case
i
have
ever
been
and
i
think
the
regulation
speak
to
themselves
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
what
the
findings,
say,
here
are
take
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
they
--
they
would
say
the
reverse.
if
for
example
at
page
120
--
120
of
the
record,
it
says
that
these
findings
were
true
as
stated
in
the
following
--
in
the
following
respects.
they
would
otherwise
say
that
the
finding
that
we
find
that
you
were
not.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
in
the
ordinary
situation,
the
findings
will
come
from
the
board.
i'm
only
showing
again.
i
didn't
show
this
to
--
as
i
say,
they
were
violating
the
regulations
showing
the
peculiar
vulnerability
of
the
petitioner
to
repeated
process
because
of
the
fact
that
he
does
not
have
the
findings
that
the
ordinary
person
will
get.
i
am
not
saying
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
here
he
--
whatever
he
is
doing
you
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
am
asking
--
i'm
pointing
out
only
the
vulnerability
of
this
defendant
because
he
didn't
get
findings
in
his
favor
which
will
make
it
even
more
likely
when
people
who
have
to
have
findings
in
their
favor
have
had
it
over
and
over
again.
those
who
don't
have
findings
in
their
favor
are
peculiarly
vulnerable.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
was
--
no,
sir.
and
i
was
explaining,
if
your
honor
please,
that
they
do
reuse
the
material.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
the
contrary,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
representation
was
no
that
this
evidence
wouldn't
be
used
over
again.
i
can
only
say
that
there's
apparently
a
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
say
there's
apparently
a
dispute
that
i
cannot
solve
as
to
what
the
representation
is.
i'm
only
saying
if
the
representation
by
mr.
rankin
was
that
the
practice
is
not
to
use
this
material
over
and
over
again
that
has
been
many
times
answered
because
it
has.
and
if
i
may
just
in
conclusion
in
the
limited
time
available,
point
out,
not
only
is
he
vulnerable
under
the
regular
practice.
not
only
as
he
peculiarly
vulnerable
because
there's
no
findings
but
he
is
essentially
more
vulnerable
because
there's
been
no
basis
for
his
clearance.
now,
mr.
rankin
this
morning
said
they
had
given
up
the
basis
of
job
security,
the
particular
job
against
the
derogatory
information.
on
february
13th,
mr.
rankin
reported
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
a
representation
from
the
defense
department.
i
am
not
in
any
way
saying
that
mr.
rankin
didn't
have
this
representation.
i'm
saying
he
reported
to
the
court
that
the
defense
department
already
had
in
effect
this
program
of
weighing
the
job
against
the
derogatory
information.
this
morning
he
reported
to
the
court,
the
defense
department
had
informed
him
that
no
such
regulation
could
be
workable
and
put
in
to
effect.
that
leaves
the
case
in
a
posture
that
it
depends
upon
the
new
regulation
which
was
handed
to
the
court
on
september
--
march
24th
and
which
is
here.
now,
i
want
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
this
new
regulation
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
if
you
will
look
on
page
4
of
this
new
regulation,
in
the
last
sentence
before
the
word
policy
and
this
sentence
is
the
old
regulation.
it's
not
in
italics.
it
says
“in
a
case
of
a
contractor
employee,
a
clearance
is
an
approval
for
the
employee
to
have
access
to
specified
categories
of
classified
information”.
everything
that's
later
italicized,
there's
a
change
in
the
regulation
is
identical
with
what
was
in
the
regulation
before.
this
regulation
changes
nothing.
now,
mr.
rankin
isn't
seriously
telling
this
court
that
a
man
who
on
october
13th
was
found
guilty
of
perjury.
october
13,
1958
was
found
guilty
of
perjury,
was
found
a
communist
that
he
can
have
access
to
all
secret
information.
the
government
isn't
saying
that.
the
government
is
saying
that
we
have
no
explanation
of
this
to
your
honors.
we
have
no
regulation
that
does
this.
and
all
i
can
say,
if
the
unfairness
which
the
government
doesn't
here
seek
to
defend
can
only
be
compounded
now
by
a
failure
to
find
relief
which
would
protect
this
petitioner
against
a
recurrence
of
the
same
unfairness.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
is
a
reference
to
it,
if
your
honor
please
in
the
greene
brief.
you'll
see
the
government
didn't
respond.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there's
no
reference
in
our
brief.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
find
several
distinctions
to
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
nugent
case
on
the
merits,
if
your
honor
please.
that
was
an
exercise
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
[laughter]
--
it
was
by
a
decree
decision.
the
nugent
case
appears
to
hold
that
you
weigh
the
need
of
the
--
in
form
of
the
government
against
the
need
of
the
person
who
has
the
procedure.
now,
my
first
and
foremost
distinction
would
be
that
i
demonstrated
yesterday
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
synapses
aren't
worth
the
paper
they
are
written
on.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
[laughs]
--
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
argue
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
reliance
there
completely
upon
the
war
--
that
was
a
war
time
operation
which
the
--
which
the
court
has
found
relevant.
again,
i
--
i
don't
know
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
--
this
--
the
--
this
was
referred
to.
that
point
was
made
by
the
majority.
i
--
i
don't
feel
that
there
are
distinctions
and
i
don't
feel
to
call
upon
to
--
to
deal
with
the
--
there
are
clear
distinctions,
i
don't
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
--
now
your
suggesting
i
argue
what
was
wrong
with
that
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
have
not
suggested
that
it
is
expunged.
what
i
am
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
government's
contention
is
a
weighing
of
the
need
of
the
government
not
to
show
against
the
need
of
the
individual
to
see.
apparently,
a
majority
of
the
court
felt
that
that
need
of
the
individual
to
see
had
been
satisfied,
although
your
honor
did
not
see
so
--
did
not
agree.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
showed
yesterday
that
the
need
to
see
here
was
so
great
that
without
seeing,
it
was
impossible
and
the
synapses
was
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on.
now
maybe
here,
a
majority
felt
that
the
synapses
was
adequate.
i
cannot
just
go
--
go
beyond
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
those
were
serious
consequences
and
if
i
were
arguing
that
case,
i
believe
i
would
be
arguing
on
your
honor's
side.
this
case,
however,
is
clearly
different
and
the
government
here
has
made
such
a
half
part
of
defense
on
the
merits
that
i
hardly
feel
that
they
thought
it's
peculiarly
applicable.
and
thank
you.
