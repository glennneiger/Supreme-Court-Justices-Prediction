mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
question
of
mootness.
it's
a
constitutional
case.
every
argument
made
by
counsel
is
directed
to
ask
in
this
court
to
decide
for
the
abstract
proposition
that
he
would
like
to
have
determined
as
to
the
effect
of
these
questions
on
constitutional
rights.
and
this
court
does
not
address
itself
to
that
type
of
questions
unless
they
are
here
in
a
solid
form
factually
with
a
case
or
controversy.
now
a
number
of
aspersions
have
been
made
about
the
government
in
this
case,
and
i'd
like
to
take
them
point
by
point
to
clear
them
up.
in
the
first
part,
when
this
case
was
brought
to
the
court,
the
government
came
here
in
its
first
memorandum
and
did
not
oppose
the
granting
of
certiorari.
it
expressly
in
its
first
memorandum
did
not
oppose
it,
but
it
did
tell
this
court
in
all
candor
that
the
matter
was
under
consideration
by
the
government
in
such
a
way
that
it
might
be
mooted.
we
believe
the
court
should
be
informed,
and
this
is
page
five
of
our
first
memorandum,
that
this
case
is
now
the
subject
of
further
review
by
the
departments
of
defense
and
justice
and
within
the
near
future
administrative
action
thereon
maybe
taken
which
could
moot
the
case
or
materially
alter
the
legal
situation.
in
such
eventuality
the
court
will
of
course
be
advised
immediately.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
was
two,
at
least
two
years,
because
he
asked
--
the
determination
was
against
him
and
he
asked
for
further
proceedings
which
he
had
a
right
to
do
under
the
procedures
and
in
that
he
was
constantly
asking
for
further
hearings
or
revision
by
the
secretary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
reason
this
case
was
singled
out
or
was
because
there
was
a
standard,
we
thought
there
was
a
standard
applied
that
should
be
reexamined
as
to
whether
or
not
that
standard
should
be
changed
throughout
the
system.
not
the
problem
of
confrontation,
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
clearance
was
made
in
every
case
on
the
basis
of
whether
a
man
would
someday
be
granted
top
secret,
instead
of
secret
or
confidential,
and
we
did
not
when
it
came
to
the
department,
we
thought
that
should
be
reexamined
and
that
every
man
should
not
be
put
against
the
test
of
top
secret.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
had
that
effect,
the
effect
was
immediately
that
there
were
11
other
cases
that
were
reexamined
according
to
the
same
standards
and
the
regulation
was
changed
in
every
case
that
came
along
was
applied
exactly
the
same
standard.
so
it
was
a
reexamination
when
this
case
came
to
the
department
for
consideration
by
the
two
departments
to
determine
whether
a
principle
was
being
misapplied
in
the
clearance
standard.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
it
was
never
asked
for
a
clearance
beyond
secret.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
for
him
and
the
probabilities
in
the
system
are
that
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
his
work
as
a
lathe
operator
or
a
die
and
tool
maker,
that
he
would
never
have
occasion
for
top
secret.
but
the
request
is
made
by
the
employer
and
the
employer
is
under
contract
with
the
government
that
he
will
not
make
these
secrets
known
to
anyone
who
is
not
properly
cleared.
so
the
--
he
signs
an
application
to
cover
that
point,
what
is
called
the
personnel
security
questionnaire
in
which
he
knows
--
he
is
asked
all
these
questions,
he
is
advised
what
it's
for
and
that
he
is
subject
to
this
if
he
is
going
to
work
on
defense
contracts.
and
no
contractor
is
permitted
by
his
contract
to
work
on
government
defense
contracts
without
agreeing
that
he
will
withhold
government
secrets
from
anybody
that
isn't
cleared.
so
the
process
was
that
someone
like
taylor,
the
company
would
ask,
will
you
--
will
the
government,
because
for
beyond
confidential
and
in
case
of
derogatory
information
even
for
confidential,
the
government
as
distinguished
from
the
employer
had
to
make
the
clearance,
so
the
company
would
write
to
the
government
or
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
government
and
ask
them,
whether
they
would
clear
taylor
and
they
asked
for
a
secret.
up
to
that
time
he
had
confidential.
an
investigation
was
made
and
the
information
developed
the
derogatory
information.
and
then
the
practice
at
that
time
under
the
regulations
and
all
cases
was
that
if
that
question
came
up,
everybody
was
considered
as
though
he
was
to
receive
top
secret
information
even
though
the
request
was,
as
to
derogatory
information
for
confidential
or
merely
for
clearance
as
to
secret.
when
that
came
to
our
attention,
it
seemed
to
the
department
and
the
defense
department
felt
the
same
way
upon
examination
of
it,
that
it
was,
here
is
a
man
that
by
the
very
nature
of
his
occupation,
they
couldn't
describe
a
situation
where
they
thought
he
would
ever
be
exposed
to
top
secret
information,
where
company
would
ever
desire,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
his
work
to
ever
ask
for
it.
and
yet
he
was
asked
to
pass
test,
necessarily
different
and
higher
as
to
the
standard
that
he
would
have
to
comply
with
to
have
access
to
that
information.
so
we
suggested
and
the
departments
working
together
that
the
test
should
be
changed
in
regard
to
the
clearance.
and
that
it
should
be
as
to
each
request
and
no
higher
so
that
when
they
asked
for
taylor's
clearance
for
secret
the
standard
was
that
and
if
they
later
asked
for
something
top
secret,
then
you
applied
the
top
secret
and
didn't
make
taylor
or
john
smith
or
anybody
else
live
up
to
top
secret
standards
in
order
to
be
get
secret
or
confidential.
it
seemed
to
be
basically
unsound
way
to
administer
the
program.
so
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
have
exactly
the
same
clearance
as
he
does.
and
he
has
exactly
the
same
right
to
access.
now
there
is
one
distinction
that
i
want
to
make
clear
about
what
the
secretary
did.
the
regulations
provide
that
the
secretary
can
reverse
the
hearing
board
and
that's
what's
happened,
what
happened
in
his
case
and
on
december
31st
the
secretary,
acting
secretary
quarles
did
proceed
to
reverse
and
he
described
just
what
he
did
in
reversing.
now
the
general
standard
for
the
hearing
boards
was
that
it
be
consistent
with
the
national
security.
but
that
does
not
purport
to
be
a
standard
that
controls
the
secretary
who
is
given
the
right
by
the
regulations
just
to
reverse
and
there
are
no
standards
that
are
made
for
him
or
prescribed
for
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
his
power
is
described
no
page
11
of
our
memorandum
in
reply
to
petitioner's
opposition.
in
the
footnote
there
in
number
three,
on
page
11
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that
is
not
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
all
of
the
record
before,
he
was
advised,
was
expunged.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
difference
is
the
language
that
the
secretary
used
in
which
he
says,
“i
hereby
find
the
requested
clearance
of
charles
allen
taylor
is
in
the
national
interest
and
i
so
order
hereby
superseding
all
previous
orders
in
this
case.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
incorrect.
that
is
assuming
that
that's
what
you
heard,
the
statement
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
clearance
is
not
correct.
the
clearance,
the
communication
to
the
employer
that
he
is
cleared
for
access
to
secret
is
exactly
like
100,000
others
and
he
has
exactly
the
same
access
to
that
material,
he
has
the
same
right
to
work
in
that
plant
on
any
secret
material
that
john
jones
or
bill
smith
or
anybody
else.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
now
the
order
of
this
acting
secretary
was
different,
but
it
was
not
in
--
we
do
not
think
there
is
difference
at
all
as
far
as
its
effect
and
the
clearance
he
was
given
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
if
anything,
this
standard
is
just
more
in
his
favor.
it's
instead
of
saying
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security
it's
in
the
national
interest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
this
is
the
only
order
like
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
his
clearance,
let
me
make
it
clear,
the
statement
of
the
fact
that
he
is
cleared
for
secret
is
like
100,000
others,
but
the
order
of
the
acting
secretary
saying
it's
in
the
national
interest
to
give
it
to
him
is
exactly
like
--
it
not
like
the
hearing
boards
make
their
order.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
know
of
no
other.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
the
way
secretaries
do
at
times
and
that's
the
only
reason
[laughter].
they
have
that
power
and
did
it.
he
conceived
that
the
national
interest
was
what
he
was
dealing
with
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh
no.
there
is
no
question
this
case
is
disposed
of
at
the
very
highest
level
possible.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
secretary
would
apply
the
same
way
to
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
rare
that
the
secretary
has
reversed
but
i
would
have
to
check
that
in
order
to
answer
it
for
you,
i
will.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
far
as
the
government
in
concerned
it
considered
there
was
no
difference.
but
whether
others
would
construe
it
as
being
different,
it
was
not
--
i'm
certain
it
was
not
intended
to
be
any
different.
and
the
secretary
was
not
only
acting
with
the
taylor
case
at
the
time,
as
this
appendix
shows,
but
he
also
made
the
order
on
page
18
of
that
memorandum,
suggesting
mootness,
in
which
he
directed
that
the
program
be
examined
so
as
to
limit
with
the
idea
of
limiting
the
test
as
to
clearance
for
the
various
categories,
and
that
it
be
adopted
the
change
as
soon
as
possible.
now
the
difficulty
we
have
about
the
job
being
a
consideration
is
at
the
same
time
we
did
in
the
department
of
justice
and
working
with
the
defense
department,
think
that
the
element
of
the
job
as
well
as
the
level
of
clearance
were
factors
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
fairness
to
the
man
in
the
program,
because
various
jobs
might
have
access
only
for
ten
minutes
a
day,
and
another
job
might
be
six
or
eight
hours
and
the
whole
program
of
security
is
based
on
the
need
to
know
concept,
but
nobody,
even
though
he
is
cleared
at
the
very
top
scientists
and
under
acute
clearance
in
the
atomic
energy
program,
does
not
get
to
see
the
secrets
of
the
government
unless
he
needs
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
secret.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
secretary,
i
didn't
talk
to
the
secretary,
but
i
don't
think
he
ever
reached
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
finding
--
the
findings
later,
the
reasons
that
were
given
were
to
the
affect
that
he
was
not
sympathetic.
even
though
he
joined
the
party
he
was
not
sympathetic,
which
were
favorable
aspects
to
the
situation.
it
was
not
just
like
a
person
who
was
a
member
of
the
party
in
sympathy
with
it
and
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
there
was
affirmative
finding
that
he
was
not
sympathetic,
and
he
was
actually
put
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yeah,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
first
he
had
to
take
the
new
standard.
before
taylor
was
being
tested
against
whether
he
was
qualified
for
top
secret,
the
new
standard
was
that
he
be
qualified
for
secret
which
is
a
lesser
test
and
under
that,
the
secretary
had
to
either
satisfy
himself
that
there
was
not
a
basis
for
the
judgment
of
the
hearing
board
or
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
or
that
under
the
test
of
secret
and
the
fact
of
the
access
to
a
different
category
than
top
secret
he
would
be
qualified
for
access.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
that
he
didn't
have
to
ever
reach
the
alternative
you
see
it
like
a
demur
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
those
are
expunged
and
just
like
peters
against
hobby
or
cole
against
young,
the
direction
was
that
they
be
expunged
and
they
are
just
not
a
part
of
the
record
in
anyway,
but
the
secretary
could
properly
have
said
assuming
all
of
those
things
under
this
standard
of
clearance,
it
should
issue
and
never
reach
the
question
of
whether
if
that
question
comes
to
me
and
they
request
top
secret,
i
would
grant
part.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
just
as
well
it
never
happened.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
there
was
a
statement.
the
language
of
the
order
of
december
31st
and
this
is
on
page
17
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
of
the
same
memorandum
for
the
response
suggesting
that
the
cause
is
moot.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
it's
a
letter
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
department
of
defense
to
counsel
for
petitioner,
in
the
second
paragraph,
language
of
order
of
december
31,
1958
which
reads,
hereby
superseding
all
previous
orders
in
this
case,
completely
expunges
all
previous
findings
in
this
case
as
if
they
had
never
been
rendered.
now
that's
official
action
by
the
department
as
to
what
had
happened.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
would
use
the
standard
of,
if
they
asked
for
a
secret
they
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
well
in
that
case
it
depends
upon
the
character
of
his
work
and
what
secret
materials
or
classified
materials
in
the
job
he
is
in
he
would
be
exposed
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
then
he
would
--
the
company
would
ask
for
clearance
for
secret.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
he
would
get
exactly
the
same
thing
that
taylor
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
would
weigh
the
nature
of
his
access
to
the
materials
in
the
job
of
secret
against
any
derogatory
information.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
test
in
the
amended
regulations
that
have
this
provision
about
clearance.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
would
be
given
a
--
the
company
would
be
advised
that
he
was
cleared
for
secret
and
he
could
proceed
to
see
all
those
same
materials
just
like
taylor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
don't
think
so
and
it
certainly
was
never
contemplated
by
anybody
in
the
government,
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
is
a
much
more
favored
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
can
assure
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
had
no
such
intention
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
when
it's
done
by
the
hearing
board
it's
generally
--
i
think
in
all
cases
clearly
consistent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
has
to
be
the
test
he
is
up
against,
in
that
it
is
that
it's
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
form,
as
you've
described.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
rejection
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now
there
was
no
intention
i'm
sure
of
anybody
to
play
on
the
words
and
yet
i
don't
want
to
mislead
anybody,
they
are
there
for
your
comparison.
the
government
thought
there
was
no
impropriety
in
the
mooting
of
this
case
if
we
were
handling
a
wrong
principle
in
the
application
and
we're
correcting
it
as
in
regard
to
all
personnel
that
might
be
involved
and
we
thought
that
when
that
came
to
the
attention
of
the
departments
that
the
sooner
it
was
corrected
the
better
and
in
a
situation
like
this
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
or
the
solicitor
can
properly
just
take
a
case
away
from
the
court
by
mooting
just
because
it
is
a
disadvantageous
or
a
undesirable
case
for
the
government,
but
i
do
think
when
you
are
trying
to
do
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
unless
you're
deliberately
trying
to
avoid
a
decision
in
a
matter
that
is
involving
a
great
many
people
that
the
court
should
decide
for
that
purpose,
but
this
court
already
had
the
greene
case
before,
was
exactly
the
same
problems
are
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
i
think
that
evidence
is
adjudicated
and
cannot
be
gone
into
again.
the
only
way
that
i
think
anything
of
that
kind
could
as
his
to
prior
experience
could
ever
be
brought
up
would
be
if
there
was
something
entirely
new
that
would
revive
it
on
its
own,
not
because
of
anything
that
was
in
the
--
what
happened
before.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
a
practice
to
treat
that
as
a
closed
chapter
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
wouldn't
say
the
government
doesn't
know,
but
because
it's
there,
but
it
isn't
--
i
inquired
into
that,
and
it
couldn't
be
used
or
brought
up
again
and
used
against
him,
and
it's
just
as
well
it
didn't
happen
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
mr.
justice,
he
had
a
confidential
and
that
was
what
was
suspended
and
then
they
wanted
to
because
of
the
nature
of
his
duties
requiring
access
to
secret,
they
asked
for
his
clearance
as
to
secret
and
that's
what
brought
up
this
whole
program.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
only
say
what
they
represent,
and
i
assume
that
that's
correct.
i
don't
know
anything
of
my
own
knowledge
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
haven't
examined
that
question
of
whether
there
is
a
government
liability.
i
think
that
this
has
to
be
examined
in
the
context
though
of
the
basic
thing
that
you're
trying
to
protect
government
secrets
and
i
don't
mean
that
you
don't
have
to
recognize
the
effect
on
--
of
the
acts
of
the
private
contractor
because
of
that
effort.
i
think
under
decisions
of
this
court
you
have
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
working
together
of
the
government
action
and
the
private
employers
action
that
does
injure
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
hasn't
been
in
practice
such
a
type
of
program
that
has
been
described
in
counsel's
brief.
the
figures
we
received
were
that
there
were
some
1,000
people
that
were
denied
classification
over
the
period
of
the
whole
program
under
the
various
administrations
that
had
been
conducting
it
for
--
back
in
world
war
ii
period
up
to
date
and
we
don't
have
complete
figures
because
they
didn't
have
some
during
the
early
period,
but
i
think
about
from
1953
on
we
have
those
figures.
i
don't
say
that
the
country
shouldn't
be
disturbed
about
that
many
people,
because
they
should,
injured
by
the
program.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
understood
that
he
was
placed
back
to
work
and
then
that
because
of
their
reducing
their
forces
he
was
let
out
of
work
in
the
ordinary
course
like
he
would
be
if
there
wasn't
any
problem
of
clearance
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know
about
--
i
don't
know
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
got
the
impression
mr.
rauh
was
not
quite
revealing
the
whole
story,
because
the
union
has
in
its
contract
that
i
have
here
agreed
that
these
provisions
about
security
they
will
recognize
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
although
i
haven't
examined
it
like
i
should
have
if
i
was
representing
him,
but
he
has
allowed
the
union
to
bargain
away
his
problem
in
regard
to
his
compensation
during
that
period.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
he
might
have
recovery
otherwise
from
the
employer
if
it
wasn't
pardon
away.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
many
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
not
--
i
just
wouldn't
know
about
that,
in
view
of
the
union's
agreement
that
they
were
would
be
bound
by
this
security
program
and
the
discharges,
it
might
not
give
him
that
relief,
i
wouldn't
want
to
hold
out
the
court
that
it
would,
i
think
that's
a
technical
question
with
relation
to
their
contract
and
the
company's
employment
arrangement.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
reason
the
case
is
moot
is
because
he
has
gotten
exactly
what
he
asked
for,
in
that
he
has
asked
for
a
clearance
and
that's
what
the
whole
thing
is
involved
about.
he
wanted
to
have
clearance
and
he
asked
for
the
record
to
be
expunged
and
that's
done.
the
only
thing
that
he
doesn't
have,
that
he
asked
for
is
a
hearing,
a
due
process
hearing
which
the
only
purpose
of
that
hearing
would
be
give
him
the
clearance
and
if
he
gets
his
judgment
either
of
dismissal
of
a
prosecution
or
any
type
of
action
of
that
kind,
when
he
gets
the
ultimate
thing
which
is
the
relief
of
the
clearance
that
permits
him
to
go
ahead,
seems
to
me
that
there
can't
be
anything
left
except
the
question
of
whether
this
was
just
a
special
situation
that's
involved
in
some
of
the
cases.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
it
would.
now
there
is
no
purpose
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
a
distinction
that
way
and
play
on
the
language.
there
is
--
if
you
get
the
mootness
question,
the
basic
problem
of
the
retention
of
government
secrets,
and
whether
the
government
is
going
to
have
that
power,
seems
to
me
that
it
has
to
be
conceded
that
the
practice
of
170
years
of
the
executive
withholding
the
primary
military
secrets
of
the
country
has
to
be
recognized.
now
we
say
that
that's
based
upon
the
inherent
powers
of
the
executive
under
the
constitution
as
commander
in
chief.
it's
been
followed
for
all
of
these
years
and
the
whole
purpose
of
this
program
is
to
try
to
protect
that
very
vital
interest
that
involves
our
missiles
program,
our
space
program,
all
of
our
defense
program,
our
battle
plans
and
every
aspect
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
that
isn't
quite
the
fact
either,
let
me
correct
that
first.
there
was
a
t
or
a
--
what
is
usually
denominated
a
t
informant
undercover
agent
involved
in
this,
one
of
the
six.
as
to
that
i
think
there
is
a
very
serious
problem,
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
were
not
undercover
agents.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
difficulty
in
regard
to
that
is
whether
or
not
you
dry
up
your
sources
of
information
or
your
intelligence
agencies
and
they
serve
many
purposes,
i'm
sure
the
court
realizes
beyond
just
this
particular
function
and
if
the
information
is
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes
that's
correct.
they
are
people
who
will
tell
the
information
if
they
are
going
to
be
forced
to
testify,
even
though
they
are
acting
in
good
faith
and
know
the
information.
but
if
they
would
forced
to
appear,
they
just
won't
tell
it
all,
because
they
would
then
have
the
information
in
the
hands
of
the
intelligence
agencies
and
they
would
have
to
be
called
up
to
testify
or
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
they
would
be
--
all
the
people
that
were
involved
would
certainly
have
to
hear
it,
and
if
they
happen
to
have
an
affinity
or
a
sympathy
with
the
soviet
or
communist
activity
or
subversive
or
anything
of
that
kind,
they
would
learn
all
of
the
information
and
as
far
as
the
casual
--
as
far
as
the
undercover
informant,
as
far
as
the
casual
informer,
those
people
just
won't
want
to
get
involved,
so
that
we
won't
have
the
information
in
regard
to
all
of
the
various
things
that
they
furnish
the
information,
if
it's
on
a
confidential
basis.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
has
that
possibility,
and
i
think
that
can
only
--
is
handled
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
relationship
what
it
is
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
not
quite
correct
either,
although
mr.
rauh
is
not
at
fault
in
saying
that
because
we
did
not
present
it
in
our
briefs,
one
of
the
witnesses
was
seen
by
a
board
member.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
other
five
are
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
knew
who
they
were,
but
whether,
they
didn't
--
i
wouldn't
say
they
knew
all
that
could
be
developed
on
cross
examination.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
those
things
are
developed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
are
given
summaries
generally
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there
are
occasions
when
they
do,
they
see
the
raw
reports
or
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
it's
depending
upon
their
requests
at
times,
from
the
information
i
received,
but
if
they
requested
it
here,
it's
often
given
to
them
in
the
original
form.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
understood
that
they
did.
i
don't
want
to
hold
out
that
that's
the
same
as
cross
examination
though.
but
there
is
a
basis
for
appraisal
of
the
type
of
person
and
whether
there
is
any
relationship,
whether
there
might
be
some
special
interest
in
the
controversy
and
that
type
of
thing,
as
far
i
think
as
it
goes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
the
party.
the
party
here
was
given
the
substance
because
that
was
put
into
the
--
dictated
into
the
record.
they
asked
for
confrontations
at
the
subsequent
hearing
and
that
was
denied
to
them.
they
asked
a
number
of
questions
in
regard
to
the
parties
that
were
the
witnesses
and
so
forth,
so
they
could
evaluate
them,
and
that
was
denied
to
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
believe
it
came
up
in
that
kind
of
posture,
it
was
on
summary
judgment
and
in
light
of
the
greene
case
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
didn't
examine
that
aspect
of
that,
but
i
think
it
was
on
the
same
general
decision.
i
don't
the
merits
has
gone
into
in
that
phase.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
yes,
there
is
no
question,
i
hope
there
is
no
statute
that
tries
to
lay
down
just
how
this
program
will
be
conducted
and
that
it
shall
not
have
confrontation
and
the
statutes
that
mr.
rauh
refers
to
in
regard
to
the
subversive
activities
commission,
we
don't
think
apply
at
all
to
this
situation
wherever
contemplated
by
congress
to
apply
to
this
situation.
it
was
entirely
different
thing,
they
were
providing
for
after
the
communist
party
was
adjudicated
as
subversing
if
that
adjudication
did
occur,
and
it's
an
entirely
different
thought
if
the
congress
was
addressing
itself
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
go
up
to
the
presidential
command
with
him
and
say
that
there
is
no
express
language
of
congress.
there
is
i
think
language
from
which
you
can
properly
infer
that
congress
contemplated
this
in
the
creation
of
the
defense
department
and
giving
it
authority
to
provide
for
the
various
materials
and
the
information
it
had
and
also
the
various
contract
or
procurement,
defense
procurement
statutes
that
contemplate
all
of
this
kind
of
business
of
protecting
the
secrets
of
the
united
states
and
contracts
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
of
that
type,
yes.
but
now
there
is
presidential
action
that
we
think
is
clear
in
executive
order
10501,
which
is
a
revision
of
an
order
by
the
prior
administration
and
it's
signed
by
president
eisenhower
and
it's
too
long
to
go
into
at
length,
but
there
is
express
provision
in
that
the
various
persons
in
the
departments
who
have
classified
information
under
their
control
shall
take
such
action
as
is
proper
to
see
that,
that
information
is
protected
and
not
disclosed
to
persons
who
are
not
properly
entitled
to
it.
it's
very
clear
in
defining
that,
it
defines
confidential,
secret
and
top
secret
information
and
goes
into
this
whole
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
face
up
to
the
basic
problem
here
and
that
is
we
can't
assume
that
this
government
can
be
without
defense
contracts.
we
can't
assume
that
it
doesn't
have
to
go
out
and
get
in
the
missile
race
and
try
to
produce
missiles
and
develop
whatever
it
can
and
all
the
other
kinds
of
armaments
and
things
that
are
secret
and
necessary
to
its
very
preservation.
so
that
means
that
you
can't
keep
a
secret
that
of
prime
importance
to
the
life
of
our
company
in
the
pentagon
and
never
let
it
out.
you've
got
to
be
able
to
let
people
who
work
on
these
contracts
develop
research
and
ideas
and
development
of
the
machines,
as
well
as
battle
plans
that
have
to
be
disclosed
to
all
the
people
in
the
military
services
and
so
forth,
all
those
things
have
to
go
beyond
some
safe
in
the
defense
department
and
in
light
of
that,
there
has
to
be
a
recognition
that
there
has
to
be
a
selection.
then
you
get
down
to
the
problem
of
how
you're
going
to
hold
these
secrets
back
and
who
is
going
to
have
access.
can
you
go
down
and
select
every
third
person
and
say
they
shall
have
access,
would
that
be
a
power
of
would
that
be
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
under
wyman
or
slochower
or
should
the
government
be
condemned
for
trying
to
do
the
best
it
can
with
this
difficult
problem
and
trying
to
find
that
best
means
as
close
as
it
can
to
some
kind
of
a
fair
hearing
in
deciding
who
should
have
access.
now
if
mr.
taylor
can
be
trusted
with
secret
information
that
he
needs
for
the
job
he
ought
to
have
it
and
the
government
ought
to
be
able
to
get
the
fruits
of
his
labor
and
not
be
condemned
for
it
and
then
it's
the
question
what
is
--
as
far
as
we
can
go
in
trying
to
protect
the
information
and
still
make
it
possible
for
this
country
to
have
its
secrets
and
develop
its
defense.
and
certainly
we
can't
--
this
court
can't
just
close
it's
eyes
to
the
proposition
as
i
see
it,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
fact
we
are
in
a
race
with
people
who
would
like
to
destroy
us
and
in
that
race
are
things
that
we
don't
want
them
to
know,
the
moment
we
develop
them
or
think
of
them
or
get
them
into
creation.
we'd
like
to
have
them
have
as
much
as
lag
as
possible
behind
us
when
we
get
that
done
and
the
problem
is,
we
shouldn't
hurt
any
citizen
in
any
particular
if
it
can
be
avoided.
but
the
country
has
got
to
be
preserved
too
and
how
are
you
going
to
make
the
selection
of
who
has
access?
certainly
the
court
would
say
it
couldn't
be
just
plain
arbitrary,
by
the
color
of
their
hair,
or
the
color
of
your
skin,
but
after
that,
do
you
have
to
disclose
the
information
that's
going
to
destroy
your
intelligence
systems,
the
life
of
the
country
is
dependant
on
that
too.
so
it
isn't
a
simple
problem
of
whether
or
not
taylor
has
been
hurt
in
this
situation
and
that's
very
important,
but
you've
got
to
also
keep
in
mind
that
nobody
tried
or
intended,
that
this
program
was
never
devised
for
the
purpose
of
hurting
taylor
or
anybody
else.
it
was
devised
to
protect
this
country
and
the
state
it
was
established
on
that
kind
of
a
basis,
and
then
how
much
can
you
do
in
conducting
the
program
and
protect
both
the
interest,
the
very
life
of
this
country,
as
well
as
the
citizen's
interest.
now
his
interest
is
consequential,
what's
basically
involved
is
the
clearance
and
the
badge
of
infamy
is
a
consequence
and
this
court
can't
disregard
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
read
a
letter
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
defense
department
addressed
to
mr.
taylor.
during
--
this
is
dated
march
31st.
during
the
argument
before
the
united
states
supreme
court
today,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
in
your
case
there
was
a
difference
between
the
standards
of
national
interest
and
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security.
i'm
authorized
to
inform
you
that
the
acting
secretary
of
defense
in
determining
on
december
31st,
1958
that
you
were
eligible
for
clearance
for
access
to
defense
information
classified
secret
did
not
intend
by
its
reference
to
the
national
interest
to
differentiate
your
status
from
that
of
all
other
employees
eligible
for
such
clearance
including
employees
as
to
whom
a
board
has
made
determination
that
access
at
such
level
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security.
in
other
words,
your
clearance
has
been
determined
to
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security.
mr.
rauh
has
responded
to
that
as
of
april
1st
referring
to
that
fact
that
he
telegraphed
the
secretary
on
january
10th
asking
if
the
secretary's
action
as
of
the
prior
date
amounted
to
certain
findings
in
regard
to
mr.
taylor
and
the
findings
are
reversing
the
earlier
findings,
withdrawing
false
charges,
announcing
that
mr.
taylor
has
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
never
paid
communist
party
dues
and
never
attended
communist
party
meetings
and
so
forth
and
establishing
that
he
has
been
truthful
and
so
asserting.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
government
does
not
say
that
this
is
making
such
findings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
he
refers
to
the
january
10th
telegram.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
he
says,
in
quoting
that,
“does
this
amount
to
these
findings.
one,
reversing
the
earlier
findings,
two,
withdrawing
the
false
charges,
three,
announcing
that
mr.
taylor
has
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
never
paid
communist
party
dues,
never
attended
communist
party
meetings
and
so
forth.
and
four,
establishing
that
he
has
been
truthful
in
asserting
--
in
so
asserting.”
and
the
answer
of
the
government
is
that
this
does
not
amount
to
such
findings.
the
answer
is
further
as
i
told
you
yesterday
that
the
prior
proceedings
are
expunged
as
he
was
so
advised.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
reversing
the
earlier
findings,
the
findings
themselves.
and
the
action
of
the
secretary
was
to
grant
him
clearance.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
is
though
they
never
were
there.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
peters
case
in
accordance
with
the
direction
of
the
court
and
in
cole
against
young.
and
it's
the
usual
practice
in
all
these
cases
to
erase
them
as
though
they
never
happened.
but
he
asks
from
informative
new
findings
that
these
things
were
in
his
favor
separate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
further
part
is
asking
for
affirmative
findings
in
regard
to
this
congress
membership
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
as
though
it
never
happened.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
advised
that
it
wouldn't
be
used
in
that
regard.
i'm
also
advised
that
by
the
very
nature
of
his
work,
he
probably
never
would
be
asking
for
access
to
top
secret
but
it
would
--
that
could
be
true
of
other
employees
in
the
program.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i'll
be
pleased
to
do
that
in
the
courtroom.
one
further
thing
the
inquiry
was
made
by
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
would
understand
that
it
--
as
a
matter
of
procedures
that
they
are
regularly
followed
that
it
would
not
be
used.
that
it's
a
matter
that
has
been
determined
and
that
it
isn't
--
can't
be
gone
back
over.
that's
my
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
or
in
any
statute
that
would
prevent
it.
the
practice
is
the
only
thing.
the
expunging
does
not
amount
to
an
affirmative
finding
in
his
favor.
it
is
an
erasure
of
the
prior
findings
against
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
let
me
clarify
the
facts.
in
the
first
place
they
found
the
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1942
and
1943.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
is
--
they
never
found
otherwise
they
found
the
next
time
that
he
was
a
member
between
1942
and
1943
that
he
was
expelled
from
the
party
because
of
his
lack
of
sympathy
with
it
in
1943.
the
interim
between
the
two
hearings
was
taken
up
by
further
investigation.
none
of
these
witnesses
has
charged
by
counsel
change
their
testimony
at
all.
that
is
not
true.
the
fact
is
that
the
fbi
and
the
department
of
defense
made
further
investigation
of
the
matter
and
it
--
that
investigation
supported
the
fact
that
he
was
expelled
but
the
witnesses
who
had
testified
continued
to
adhere
to
the
stories
that
they
had
presented
--
that
it
presented
the
confidential
information.
so
there
was
the
additional
finding
by
the
additional
investigation
of
his
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
party
and
his
expulsion.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
he
was
not
except
his
own
testimony
and
his
own
witnesses
are
confidential.
now,
in
regard
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
douglas
about
compensation
from
the
time
he
had
been
out
of
work,
i'm
advised
that
he
will
be
fully
compensated
that
his
counsel
have
already
asked
for
the
forms
that
he
could
get
his
compensation,
the
difference
between
what
he
will
receive
and
what
he
should
have
received
if
he
had
been
employed
during
that
period
and
that
this
is
not
a
special
treatment
on
mr.
taylor,
but
the
regulations
in
section
26
or
i
guess
it's
paragraph
26
on
page
32
of
the
supplement,
expressly
provide
for
monetary
restitution
in
this
kind
of
a
case
and
he
is
to
be
paid
the
amount
of
that
difference.
now,
in
regard
to
the
job
position,
i
should
like
to
clarify
that.
that
was
an
idea
of
the
department
of
justice
as
trying
to
put
in
further
element
of
consideration
for
the
need
of
access
in
the
regulations.
and
when
it
was
presented
and
examined
on
a
working
level
in
the
department
that
have
the
administration
of
the
program,
it
was
found
that
it
was
not
workable
and
this
is
the
reason
that
it
was
not.
it
was
found
that
with
the
bell
aircraft
company
when
they
made
a
reduction
enforced
under
the
seniority
program
which
is
generally
called
bumping
that
with
a
reduction
of
4,500
members
of
the
union,
it
involved
26,000
shifts
of
position
of
the
employees
so
that
you
would
be
busy
in
the
government
examining
on
a
job
basis
continuously
because
every
time
that
someone
was
eliminated,
a
man
could
move
into
that
position
and
be
at
a
different
job
and
instead
of
being
like
it
is
now
where
you
would
have
a
clearance,
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
procedures
every
few
days
or
weeks
depending
upon
the
situation
and
it
also
would
involve
the
administrative
problem
and
it
did
not
seem
at
all
practical
and
also
would
put
a
burden
upon
the
employees
that
was
not
realistic
and
would
be
a
hindrance
to
the
proper
development
carrying
on
the
defense
program.
same
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
20%
turnover
in
this
company
of
employees,
we
were
advised.
and
in
view
of
that,
the
job
position
movement
in
which
every
time
there
was
turnover,
the
man,
if
it
was
a
problem
of
seniority
has
the
right
to
bid
for
the
better
position
would
be
constantly
subjected
to
that
kind
of
situation
and
that's
why
the
idea
of
a
job
position
element
of
consideration
was
abandoned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
it
seemed
--
it
just
seemed
impracticable
in
view
of
the
relationships
between
the
unions
and
the
companies
and
what
it
would
involve
for
the
employees.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
another
factor
and
that
is
this
problem
of
the
inherent
power
of
the
--
the
president,
the
executive
to
have
the
protection
of
the
military
secrets
of
the
country.
this
has
been
claimed
by
the
president
for
170
years
and
it
is
of
primary
consideration
and
that
any
interval
that
there
might
be
in
the
conduct
of
the
defense
program
between
any
kind
of
legislation
or
other
action
if
the
court
would
find
there
was
not
such
a
power
which
would
be
a
constitutional
question
in
itself
would
involve
the
fact
that
the
president
had
no
power
to
protect
the
secrets
of
the
country
during
such
a
period.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
problem
you
get
into
there
is
the
question
of
interest
and
it's
the
question
of
the
--
i
think
there
would
be
no
question
about
that
except
for
the
cases
such
as
wieman
against
updegraff
and
the
slockhower
case.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
i
think
they
are
different
in
this
regard.
there,
you're
dealing
with
a
standard
and
you
said
that
the
standard
cannot
be
one
that's
irrational.
you
didn't
say
that
he
had
any
interest
in
wieman
if
you'll
recall.
you
passed
that
question
on
whether
he
had
the
right
to
the
job
at
all.
but
you
did
say
that
you
can't
classify
and
use
the
example
of
--
on
the
basis
that
he
was
either
a
negro
or
a
republican
or
a
jew.
those
were
the
three
various
classifications
that
were
used
as
examples.
and
you
could
not
make
a
classification
of
that
type
which
was
irrational
as
your
standard.
but
this
is
--
the
basic
question
here,
is
whether
or
not
this
man
has
a
right
to
the
clearance
that
is
to
see
the
government's
secrets.
does
he
have
a
constitutional
right
to
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process?
and
the
question
that
must
be
considered
as
i
see
it
--
all
of
them
this
case
is
whether
or
not
if
the
administrator
has
a
hearing
and
he
has
information
of
a
confidential
character
from
someone
who
is
an
agent,
who
is
an
undercover
agent
as
the
most
extreme
case.
and
that
person
has
seen
the
particular
employee
in
a
communist
cell
actively
participating
in
that
activity
to
try
to
defeat
the
whole
program
of
this
country
having
that,
but
not
being
able
to
reveal
it
because
this
undercover
agent
cannot
be
presented
without
destroying
his
effectiveness.
he
may
have
been
planted
there
and
somehow
as
much
as
15
years
ago.
then,
does
this
court
--
is
this
court
going
to
tell
that
administrator
that
this
man
who
has
no
legal
right
to
access
as
such
to
the
military
secrets
of
the
united
states,
the
administrator
must
disregard
such
information
as
he
has
and
give
to
the
man
the
greatest
secrets
that
we
have,
which
give
us
an
edge
over
our
enemy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
want
to
say
to
this
court
and
i
don't
say
to
this
court
that
the
case
of
the
confidential
informant
who
is
not
an
undercover
agent
is
the
same
problem
that
those
who
are
more
casual
informants
are.
i
think
that
is
a
different
problem
and
there,
you
have
to
face
up
to
the
question
of
whether
drying
up
the
general
sources
of
information
of
that
character,
which
is
the
belief
of
the
intelligence
agencies
in
good
faith
that
will
have
the
effect
is
better
to
do
in
regard
to
this
where
there
is
no
right
to
access
to
military
secrets.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
that.
whether
the
court
wants
to
say
that
that
is
necessary
to
do
or
whether
that
testimony
which
is
not
a
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
but
whether
this
person
should
have
access
to
these
military
secrets,
whether
he
should
--
the
administrator
should
disregard
that
information
entirely.
now,
that's
what
it
faces
up
to
in
that
particular
category
of
informants.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
first
place,
i
say
that
there
is
no
right
to
due
process
because
there's
no
substantive
right
to
see
the
secrets
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
might
be
so
irrational
under
a
weiman
case
that
he
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
what?
yes,
i
think
it's
a
balancing
of
the
best
that
can
be
done
and
preserving,
doing
as
much
as
possible
for
his
interest
in
preserving
the
primary
interest
of
the
military
secrets
of
the
country
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
only
if
the
court
is
satisfied
that
that
which
is
claimed
to
be
a
threat
to
the
country
and
the
maintenances
of
its
intelligence
processes
is
a
real
threat
and
then
balancing
his
interest
against
the
interest
of
the
country.
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
impingement
upon
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
court
--
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
that
the
court
should
not
get
into
of
trying
to
have
a
trial
in
every
case
of
whether
or
not
this
particular
witness
should
have
been
produced
or
not
and
whether
the
governmental
processes
or
such.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
will
so
involve
the
courts
in
examining
the
material
and
matter
in
that
regard
and
without
having
the
basis
for
judgment
that
in
regard
to
it
--
that
maybe
the
only
alternative
would
be
for
the
courts
to
set
up
the
whole
program
which
i
don't
think
the
courts
would
want
to
or
in
our
separation
of
powers
would
do.
it's
so
difficult
without
getting
to
case
by
case
in
every
witness
judging.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
interest
involved
legally,
historically,
are
such
that
they're
entitled
to
that
kind
of
the
decision
by
the
court
in
every
instances
to
every
witness.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
he
does.
now,
i
want
you
to
understand,
however,

to
those
who
did
not
have
confrontation
and
because
of
that
claim
that
they
didn't
have
a
fair
hearing
when
therefore
still
denied
a
clearance
that
they
would
not
get
the
benefits
of
this
section.
but
taylor
is
clearly
entitled
to
it
and
will
proceed
