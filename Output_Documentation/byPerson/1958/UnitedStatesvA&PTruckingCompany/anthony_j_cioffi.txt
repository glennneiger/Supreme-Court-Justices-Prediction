mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
associate
justices.
in
order
to
properly
go
into
the
background
as
to
what
law
was
in
effect
when
congress
enacted
the
statutes
in
question,
it
was
--
it
is
first
necessary
for
me
to
give
a
very
brief
resume
of
what
happened
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
i
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
appellee
in
this
matter
and
i
appeared
before
judge
smith
of
the
united
state
district
court
and
the
partnership
were
indicted
as
entities
and
the
individual
partners
were
named
if
the
entity
affirmed
a
--
and
that
our
contention
was,
in
view
of
the
american
freightways
case
and
in
the
view
of
the
boyce
motor
lines
case
which
just
came
down
shortly
before
that
that
a
partnership
is
not
an
entity
separate
and
distinct
from
the
partners
for
the
purposes
of
criminal
liability.
and
i
substantiated
the
arguments
with
the
various
cases
which
had
interpreted
us
--
18
u.s.c.
835
and
the
other
statutes
thereto.
and
judge
smith
in
his
decision,
in
the
record
on
page
19,
the
official
record
next
to
the
--
at
the
semicolon
at
the
commerce
commission
stated,
“the
court
having
decided
that
defendant
partnership
as
an
entity
is
not
subject
to
a
criminal
liability
under
the
section
set
forth
and
therefore
the
informations
were
dismissed.
now,
in
order
to
properly
decide
whether
or
not
a
partnership
is
an
entity,
it
is
necessary
to
go
into
the
history
of
partnership
and
i
will
try
to
be
very
brief.
there
are
two
theories
of
partnership.
there
is
a
mercantile
theory
which
was
the
entity
theory
and
after
that
we
had
our
common
law
or
aggregate
theory
and
at
that
time
that
the
section
was
enacted
by
the
court,
the
original
section,
we
were
operating
on
the
common
law
theory.
in
1900,
the
dean
ames
at
the
request
of
the
commercial
institution
submitted
through
drafts,
which
drafts
were
based
on
the
entity
theory
of
partnership
similar
to
a
corporation
of
partnership
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
members
who
composed
a
partnership.
this
was
objected
too
because
of
the
various
state
constitutions
and
in
dean
ames'
definition,
he
stated
that
a
partnership
was
a
legal
person
composed
of
two
or
more
individuals
to
conduct
a
business
for
a
profit,
and
that
was
objected
to
by
the
persons
who
were
there
in
its
uniform
partnership
act.
on
dean
ames'
death,
the
drafting
of
the
uniform
partnership
act
evolved
to
(inaudible).
now,
this
same
question,
“is
a
partnership
an
entity?”
came
up
in
1911
at
the
time
that
these
drafts
were
being
submitted
and
they
were
fairly
discussed
as
to
whether
we
should
had
the
aggregate
theory
of
partnership,
the
theory
which
we
have
today
or
whether
or
not
we
should
have
the
entity
theory
of
partnership
and
dean
lewis
submitted
two
drafts
of
the
uniform
partnership
act
for
approval.
one
draft
was
a
legal
entity
theories
we
have
which
the
governors
intending
to
proceed
on
now
and
the
other
draft
which
he
submitted
was
the
aggregate
theory
draft.
there
was
considerable
discussion
of
attorneys,
businessmen,
teachers
attended
these
conferences
and
the
conferences
lasted
for
two
days
and
they
decided
that
in
view
of
the
long
history
of
common
law
as
to
the
fact
that
a
partnership
was
an
association
of
two
or
more
persons
who
carry
on
a
business
as
co-owners
to
the
profit
that
they
would
accept
the
aggregate
theory
and
the
partners
would
be
--
not
distinguished
from
the
partnership
themselves,
they
would
be
more
or
less
joint
principles
as
co-owners
of
property.
now,
there
are
various
reasons
why
it
would
be
very
detrimental
if
the
existing
law
as
to
the
aggregate
theory
of
partnership
were
to
be
disturbed.
many
persons
engaged
in
business
going
to
business
as
a
partner.
they
lent
to
each
other
their
skills
and
they
donate
their
moneys
into
this
partnership
effort
and
persons
who
deal
with
these
partners,
know
that
they
cannot
own
--
they
can
look
to
their
partnership
for
payment
of
their
obligations
and
they
also
can
look
to
the
individual
partners
for
payment
of
any
obligations
arising
out
of
the
conduct
of
the
business.
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
yes,
sir.
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
well
at
that
time
that
congress
enacted
that
in
1866
that
we
were
operating
under
the
common
law
theory
of
partnerships
which
–-
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
well
--
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
well
--
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
mr.
frankfurter
–-
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
to
the
word
partnership
which
was
adopted
at
that
time
it
was
adopted
as
to
what
it
meant
at
that
time
and
at
that
time
it
meant
that
the
partners
were
not
an
entity.
they
were
not
separate
and
distinct
from
the
partnership
in
itself
when
they
used
the
term
partnership.
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
yes,
sir.
i
do
read
that
way.
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
in
these
circumstances,
i
do.
i
--
i
feel
that
congress
never
intended
partnership
in
the
sense
of
being
an
entity
in
the
statutes
involved
that
when
they
said
partnership
they
didn't
mean
it
as
an
entity.
they
meant
it
as
the
individual
partners
--
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
the
congress
does
have
the
power
but
congress
has
not
done
it
clearly.
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
but
congress
does
have
the
power.
there
is
no
question
as
to
that.
mr.
anthony
j.
cioffi
it
meant
the
members
of
the
partnership
and
the
partnership
not
as
an
entity.
it
meant
that
a
partnership
actually
was
accepted
in
that
--
during
that
period
and
that
it
was
adopted
by
the
aggregate
theory
of
partnership
and
that
--
that
it
was
the
very
discussion
--
that
was
the
very
discussion
which
came
up
at
the
time
that
it
was
being
enacted
as
to
what
effect
would
it
have
on
this
whole
theory
of
common
law
of
the
relationship
of
partners
if
they
would
declare
a
partnership
as
an
entity.
and
--
and
then
it
was
decided
that
we
should
accept
the
aggregate
theory
and
not
the
entity
theory
and
that's
what
our
state
operates
under
and
i
believe
37
other
states
and
their
territories
under
the
aggregate
theory
of
partnership.
we
could
have
run
into
very
serious
problems.
there
were
two
cases
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me,
in
california,
one
case
was
in
california,
people
versus
malgene,
167
pacific
597
and
its
referred
to
in
my
brief
on
page
13
--
13
and
14.
in
that
case,
peter
malgene
was
indicted
for
embezzlement
and
he
was
a
partner
in
the
malgene
freight.
they
agreed
to
ship
grapes
for
delivery
and
peter
malegene
charged
and
went
off
with
the
proceeds.
he
embezzled
the
proceeds.
at
the
conviction
the
plaintiff
appealed
on
the
grounds
that
the
indictment
charge
he
was
an
agent
of
homsy
and
thereby
such
agency
the
money
came
through
his
hands
which
was
property
of
this
--
this
individual
and
he
embezzled
it
and
the
court
said,
“the
district
attorney
could
not
have
charged
a
partnership
as
an
entity
with
having
embezzled
these
funds.
the
party
charged
with
embezzlement
in
such
cases
must
be
the
individual
partner,
who
convert
the
funds”
and
there
aren't
any
cases
at
all
that
i
--
i
have
read
the
cases
in
the
government's
brief
and
in
my
brief,
i
tried
to
do
as
best
as
i
could,
where
a
partnership
has
been
convicted
as
an
entity.
that
our
law
is
such
that
guilt
is
personal,
we
haven't
accepted
to
respondi
act
court
theory
in
criminal
law
and
in
order
to
convict
the
man
you
cannot
impute
guilt
on
him
he
must
be
tried.
now,
a
--
a
partnership
is
no
more
than
an
extension
of
a
proprietorship.
you
have
a
proprietorship
which
is
one
individual.
he
has
employees
working
for
him.
still
it
is
necessary
to
indict
him
or
to
present
him
with
information
and
prove
--
prove
the
case
against
him
beyond
reasonable
doubt
or
with
the
criminal
law
that
we
have.
a
proprietorship
is
just
two
or
more
individuals
and
the
same
rule
applies
to
proprietorship
as
applies
to
an
individual.
now
congress
has
expressed
its
intent
in
the
statutes
involved
18
u.s.c.
835
and
in
222
(a)
of
the
motor
carrier
act
that
knowledge
and
willfulness
is
a
part
that
must
be
considered
in
finding
a
person
guilty.
and
the
18
u.s.c.
835
has
been
decided
and
most
of
all
our
cases
in
this
court
and
in
the
circuit
courts
hold
that
they
must
prove
--
the
court
must
prove
willfulness
and
it
is
respectfully
requested
that
the
motion
of
--
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed
as
to
the
dismissal.
