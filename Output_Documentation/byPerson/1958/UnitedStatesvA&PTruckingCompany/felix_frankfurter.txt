so
that,
from
a
(inaudible)
legally
speaking,
there
would
be
no
incongruity.
i'm
saying
legally.
not
exactly
for
policy
or
--
but
legally
speaking,
there
would
be
no
incongruity
in
saying
in
section
2
or
3,
congress
in
effect
said,
they
adopt
the
entity
theory
for
section
222,
but
congress
didn't
do
it,
but
18-835.
justice
felix
frankfurter
legally
speaking.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
argumentative
the
--
the
implication,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
congress
does
define
a
person
to
include
a
partnership,
that
is
mitigating
your
act
against
the
government's
perspective
(inaudible)
the
opposite
the
entity
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
leads
us
to
a
much
easier
problem
in
view
of
the
state
and
such
a
corporation
on
the
particular
state
law
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that's
right.
it
depends
on
--
the
state
law
may
--
may
have
really
assimilated
them
to
a
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
those
cases,
there
--
was
it
been
on
the
(inaudible)
that
some
theory
of
the
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
might
be
in
the
district
court.
there
might
be
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
initial
date
of
18
u.s.c.
835?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
one
way
of
dealing
with
that
problem,
is
not
dealing
with
these
words
that
give
rise
to
these
argument
of
purposeful
desire?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it
adds
social
policy
or
even
judicial
policy
to
exact
care
brought
us
upon
this
in
training
fee
to
legislation
and
the
lax
of
the
interpretation
by
court,
the
lax
the
responsibility
exercised
by
the
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
same
--
but
the
same
requirement
applies
to
an
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
--
the
stiffness
of
the
construction
has
to
be
judged
in
the
light
of
all
those
on
whom
the
construction
falls.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
didn't
cover
more
than
you
have
given
me
up
to
this
point.
if
you
think
that
the
--
the
content
of
liability
would
be
different
in
the
case
of
an
individual
from
that
of
a
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
it
be
by
--
and
you
would
make
a
distinction
between
the
imposition
of
a
money
that
was
here
and
the
term
imprison
which
is
under
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
same
statute
--
under
the
same
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
different
involvement
or
relationship
between
the
deed
and
the
consequence
than
would
be
the
case
of
an
agent
for
the
partnership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
like
applicable
to
this?
i
mean
the
--
the
requirement,
the
extent
of
the
requirement
of
the
nexus
between
the
agents
doing
and
the
responsibility
of
the
principal.
is
that
correct
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cioffi.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
before
us
isn't
this
abstract
question
whether
you
should
adopt
the
mercantile
theory
of
madison
or
the
old
common
law
theory
of
an
aggregate
because
long
before
that
the
discussion
was
ripe
for
the
--
through
this
whole
commission
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
what
is
now
1
u.s.
1
it
simply
goes
back
to
define
the
statute
to
define
person
to
include
the
partnership
not
as
an
abstract
juristic
problem,
but
as
a
legislative
definition
which
is
preceded
theories
to
the
constitutional
acceptance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
definition
of
partnership
that
which
is
now
1
u.s.
as
the
model.
that
the
theory
of
entity
must
begin
to
begin
with
your
--
someone
accepts
as
legislative
device
for
reading
statutes
congress
demanded
this
court
and
all
of
the
courts
when
appropriate
to
leave
persons
away
when
you
of
partnership.
so
the
question
is
to
get
such
questions
with
the
common
law
concept
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
the
first
place,
that
definitory
section
is
applicable
to
835
and
secondly,
whether
(inaudible)
to
the
fact
that
he
fixed
it
all
come
in
carriers
he
tried
the
carrier
was
it
all
commentary
to
the
matter
what
commercial
--
do
we
mean
you're
carrying
on
what
the
commercial
enterprise
is
or
partnership,
corporation
of
the
new
york
state
association
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
going
to
get
--
come
to
grips
with
that
specific
thing
rather
than
that
which
everybody
can
see
i
suppose
that
the
common
law
didn't
take
the
continental
commercial
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
when
the
word
--
when
the
word
partnership
is
good
and
i
think
that
argument
would
prevail,
but
when
they
said
--
when
we
say
the
word
person,
when
we
say
persons
do
we
mean
to
include
by
a
--
as
a
collective
conception
--
two
or
three
people
running
a
business
--
a
partnership
was
never
left
to
be
deemed
as
one.
the
way
i
read
1
u.s.c.
1,
don't
you?
