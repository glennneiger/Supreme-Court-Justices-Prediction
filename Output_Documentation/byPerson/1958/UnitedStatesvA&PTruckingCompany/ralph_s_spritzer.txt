mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
these
two
companion
cases
involve
two
motor
carriers,
both
doing
business
as
partnerships,
both
of
them
sued
as
partnerships.
both
were
charged
with
misdemeanors
in
that
they
had
violated
certain
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
informations
were
dismissed
in
both
cases
on
the
same
day
by
the
same
judge
on
the
ground,
and
this
is
a
quotation
from
their
respective
orders,
“on
the
ground
that
a
partnership
as
an
entity,
is
not
subject
to
liability
under
the
section
set
forth.”
since
that
holding
of
court
involved
a
determination
as
to
the
scope
or
coverage
of
the
statute
this
case
is
hereon
direct
appeal.
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties,
let
me
say
at
the
outset,
that
the
informations
here
run
only
against
partnership
entity.
no
partners
were
charged
as
individuals
with
that.
thus
the
ultimate
question,
a
question
of
course
on
which
the
court
below
ruled
against
the
government,
is
whether
the
partnership's
defendant
charged
as
such,
could
be
penalized
under
the
regulatory
statutes
involved.
the
statutes
under
which
they
were
charged
are
two
in
number.
and
the
first
of
these
is
section
222
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
set
forth
at
page
two
of
the
government's
brief
and
that
as,
your
honors
will
note,
is
the
comprehensive
misdemeanor
section
of
the
motor
carrier
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
provides
in
substance
that
any
person
knowingly
violating
any
provision
of
that
statute
or
any
rule
or
regulation
promulgated
under
the
motor
carrier
provisions,
or
any
condition
of
operating
authority,
is
subject
to
fine
as
prescribed,
the
fines
under
that
section
running
from
one
through
$500.
222
(a)
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
203
(a)
printed
immediately
below
it
in
our
brief,
which
is
the
definition
section
appearing
of
course
in
the
same
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
that
defines
person
to
mean
any
individual,
firm,
co-partnership,
corporation,
company,
association,
et
cetera.
the
other
statute
which
is
involved
in
these
informations
is
18
u.s.c.
835
in
provision
of
the
criminal
code,
which
relates
exclusively
to
the
subject
of
carriage
of
explosives
or
other
dangerous
articles
and
that
is
set
out
at
page
4
in
the
government's
brief.
it
provides,
as
your
honors
will
note,
that
the
commission
shall
promulgate
explosives
regulations,
which
shall
be
binding
upon
all
common
carriers.
it
then
provides
in
the
penalty
section
that
whoever
knowingly
violates
is
subject
to
fine
or
imprisonment.
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
no
death
or
bodily
injury
is
involved,
the
fine
maybe
as
much
as
a
thousand
dollars
or
imprisonment
for
as
long
as
one
year.
there
is
a
definition
section
to
be
examined
in
connection
with
that
statute.
there
is
the
general
definition
section
of
the
united
states
code
in
1
u.s.c.
1.
it
says
that
the
word,
“whoever”
includes
corporations,
companies,
associations,
firms,
partnerships,
and
so
forth,
unless
the
context
of
the
particular
act
indicates
otherwise.
this
statute
to
which
i've
last
referred,
18
u.s.c
835,
is
the
same
statute,
your
honors,
will
recall,
which
was
involved
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
american
freightways
which
was
here
in
the
1956
term.
in
that
case,
a
district
court
had
similarly
dismissed
an
information
in
that
instance
laid
exclusively
under
18
u.s.c.
835
on
the
ground
adopted
here
by
the
district
court
in
new
jersey,
that
the
partnership
was
not
liable.
the
dismissal
in
that
case
was
affirmed
by
this
court
by
an
equally
divided
court.
so,
the
issue
under
18
u.s.c.
835,
as
to
the
amenability
of
the
partnership
entity
is
one
as
to
which
this
court
has
not
definitively
spoken.
so
far
as
the
other
statute
which
is
here
today
is
concerned,
222,
that
issue
has
not
been
before
this
court
at
all.
i'd
like
to
attempt
to
deal
with
the
problem
raised
by
this
case,
if
i
may,
in
three
steps.
first,
as
we
see
it,
there
is
the
question
which
i
think
need
not
to
detain
one
long
whether
congress
has
the
power,
the
broad
power,
to
treat
a
partnership
as
a
distinct
entity
to
personify
them
for
purposes
of
a
particular
regulatory
statute.
the
second
question,
assuming
there
is
that
power
is
whether
congress
in
enacting
the
statues
here
involved,
had
the
requisite
purpose
and
has
adequately
expressed
it.
and
third,
there
is
the
question
which
is
stressed
by
appellees,
whether
the
fact
that
the
statutes
here
involved
call
for
proof
of
knowledge
or
of
willfulness
creates
an
obstacle
to
the
result
of
the
government
is
urging,
namely,
holding
the
partnership
entity
perhaps
on
the
basis
of
the
acts
of
its
agents.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you
on
this
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
said,
appellees
draw
comfort
in
arguing
that
a
partnership
is
not
amenable
to
this
statute
from
the
fact
--
to
these
statutes
from
the
facts
that
the
statute
used
--
statute
used
the
words,
“knowingly”
and
“willfully”.
now,
our
position
as
to
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
we
did
not
allege
that
the
individual
partners
personally
knew.
in
other
words,
our
theory
is,
that
when
we
charge
a
partnership
as
an
entity,
then
we
can
make
out
the
offense
in
the
same
way
that
we
could
when
a
corporation
is
charged
as
to
the
defendant
namely,
by
proving
the
knowing,
conscious
violation
of
anybody,
agent
or
employee
of
the
company
acting
in
the
course
of
the
company's
business.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
necessarily
limited
because
we
say
to
the
court,
a
partnership
organization,
a
partnership
entity
can't
be
put
in
jail
any
more
than
a
corporate
personnel.
in
other
words,
we
can
say
the
only
penalty
that
is
applicable
when
the
business
organization
as
such
is
the
defendant
is
defined.
now,
of
course,
section
222
only
provides
for
a
fine
and
the
imprisonment
aspect
is
limited
to
the
other
statute,
the
explosives
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
congress
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
so,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
incongruity.
our
argument
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
permits
us
to
proceed
in
the
same
way
with
what
ends
in
corporate
offense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct.
the
information
in
--
in
the
freightways
case
involved
only
835.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
as
one
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
unincorporated
associations,
yes,
sir,
the
same
rule
is
invloved.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
under
a
commercial
offense
of
this
kind,
yes,
your
honor
with
the
punishment
restricted
to
a
fine
of
the
entity
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well,
of
course,
associations
would
vary
i
suppose
in
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
in
some
instances
(inaudible)
so.
now,
as
to
the
first
of
these
three
(inaudible)
namely,
all
power
of
congress,
our
position
is
simply
that
a
state
may
adopt
if
it
chooses
the
civil
law
or
entity
theory
of
the
partnership
on
the
grounds
of
varying
degrees
or
varying
purposes
and
congress
similarly,
if
it
chooses
and
may
do
so
for
purposes
of
a
particular
regulation
or
statute
within
the
federal
power.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
–
no,
certainly
no
constitutional
issue
there.
our
opponent
does
seem
to
say
that
--
suggests
that
congress
has
never
gone
the
--
under
the
common
law
theory
because
we
point
these
numerous
regulatory
statutes
which
we
didn't
(inaudible)
under
which
quite
specifically,
congress
has
defined
persons
who
embrace
various
types
of
business
organizations.
and
i
--
i
won't
carry
any
longer
on
this
point
except
to
say
one
word
about
the
adams
express
case
because
that
is
opposed
to
the
situation
we
had
here.
it
involved
regulation
of
a
carrier
and
that
is
--
it's
a
railroad
carrier
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
part
i.
and
in
that
case,
adams
made
the
defense
when
it
was
charged
with
a
regulatory
violation
that
it
couldn't
be
fined
because
it
was
not
a
corporation.
it
was
an
unincorporated
association
and
justice
holmes
speaking
for
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
congress'
power,
these
are
his
words,
“to
charge
the
partnership
assets
with
the
liability,
and
to
personify
the
company
so
far
as
to
collect
a
fine
by
proceeding
against
it
by
the
company
name.“
well,
going
on
then
to
the
question
of
congress
of
the
purpose
in
these
acts,
i've
already
referred
to
the
passing
with
me
referring
to
the
brief.
section
222,
of
course,
covers
the
whole
gamut
of
regulatory
offenses
in
part
ii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
where
one
to
go
through
the
various
sections
which
imposed
the
multiple
requirements
to
which
motor
carriers
are
subject,
one
would
find
that
invariably,
these
sections
impose
the
obligation
upon
carriers.
that
is
true
similarly
of
the
implementing
regulations
promulgated
by
the
commission.
the
whole
function
of
this
statutory
scheme
is
to
require
all
carriers
to
live
up
to
the
prescribed
and
acceptable
standards
of
performance
and
we
think
it
would
be
anomalous
if
the
statutes
were
interpreted,
particularly
in
the
case
like
this
where
there
is
a
fine
for
a
business
offense,
we
think
it
would
be
anomalous
if
one
could
proceed
against
the
corporate
defendants,
but
not
against
the
carriers
as
such
doing
business
in
other
forms.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
very
unusual
in
the
case
of
rail
carriers
but
quite
common
among
motor
carriers.
we
have
listed
in
an
appendix
to
this
brief
beginning
at
page
38.
“prosecution
is
a
partnership
under
part
ii
for
a
two
plus
year
period.”
these
are
all
unrecorded
cases
in
which
there
were
successful
prosecutions
of
motor
carrier
partnerships.
there
are
very
few
reported
cases
which
raised
this
issue
because
nobody
raised
it
until
after
the
information
was
dismissed
in
the
american
freightways
case.
up
until
that
time,
there
has
been
countless
prosecutions
in
the
district
court
in
which
it
had
been
either
assumed
or
has
been
overlooked
the
point.
we've
also
listed
in
that
appendix
many
other
unreported
cases
under
other
regulatory
statutes
in
which
the
government
has
proceeded
against
partnership.
some
of
those
statutes
that
do
not
require
a
proof
of
willfulness
or
knowledge
if
you're
looked
into.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
understand
that
it
had.
there
is
no
opinion
(inaudible).
i
understand
there
had
been
cases
under
section
222
in
which
a
sole
proprietorship
was
stood
by
the
company
name.
i
believe
they
were
terminated
either
by
a
no-law
plea
or
by
guilty
plea
and
upon
so,
there
is
no
opinion
of
which
i'm
aware
discussing
that
issue.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
as
i
--
as
i
say,
the
only
cases
we
have
are
unreported
cases,
cases
which
did
not
result
in
an
appeal.
so,
there's
no
opinion
to
--
there
is
no
basis
for
an
answer.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
but
then
not
(inaudible)
opinion
on
that.
now,
i've
already
mentioned
so
far
as
835,
18
u.s.c
835
is
concerned,
that
we
place
heavy
emphasis
upon
the
declaration
in
the
statute
itself
that
these
regulations
shall
be
binding
upon
all
common
carriers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
its
predecessors
go
all
the
way
back
to
1866,
which
accounts
i
think
for
the
fact
that
it
is
a
provision
of
the
criminal
code
and
never
has
been
brought
into
the
commerce
act.
in
1866
after
some
disasters
involving
the
carriage
of
nitroglycerin,
congress
provided
regulation
of
itself
and
the
offenses
remained
incorporated
in
the
criminal
code
ever
since.
so,
some
time
after
the
enactment
of
the
commerce
act,
commerce
--
congress
delegated
to
the
commission
the
function
of
promulgating
regulations
and
it's
made
the
penalty
attached
to
those
commission
regulations
for
violation
of
them.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
do
not
know
of
any,
your
honor,
but
i
will.
i
have
not
made
any
exhaustive
check
of
that,
and
if
i
should
find
that
there
has
been
any
bill
introduced,
i
will
inform
--
introduce
--
i'll
inform
the
court.
i
would
be
very
much
surprised
if
there
has
been
any
hearing
or
committee
report
on
that
that
i
don't
know
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
the
court,
please.
in
elaboration
of
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
earlier
i'm
able
to
confirm
that
there
has
been
no
legislation
offered
on
the
subject
as
covered
by
this
court's
american
freightways
decision
since
that
day.
turning
to
the
implications
that
flow
from
the
fact
that
these
statutes
require
proof
of
scienter
or
knowledge,
the
suggestion
that
the
inclusion
of
the
word
“knowing”
should
lead
the
court
to
conclude
that
a
partnership
entity
is
not
liable.
it
seems
to
us,
to
begin
with,
proved
too
much
because
appellees
apparently
don't
questions
as
indeed
they
hardly
could
in
the
light
of
the
numerous
decisions,
including
decisions
of
this
court
that
a
corporation
may
be
held
criminally
liable
under
18
u.s.c.
835.
therefore,
it
must
be,
we
think,
that
this
is
a
statute
in
which
the
word
“knowing
or
willful”
requires
the
government
to
prove
that
the
violation
was
conscious,
but
not
a
case
in
which
the
government
is
required
to
prove
criminal
intent
or
evil
or
corrupt
purpose
in
the
sense
that
one
must
prove
mens
rea
in
a
common-law
crime.
we
think,
in
other
words,
that
“knowing”
and
“willful”
in
this
statute
means
simply
that
it
is
a
defense
that
the
violation
was
wholly
inadvertent.
we
don't
think
it's
a
defense
for
the
proprietors
of
the
business
to
say,
“we're
not
liable
because
we
didn't
bother
with
this.
we
delegated
all
responsibility
to
our
underlings.”
to
take
such
a
view
of
the
statute
would
indeed
hamper
enforcement
if
not
largely
cripple
it
and
i
say
that
for
these
reasons.
if
one
looks
at
the
explosives
regulations
that
are
involved
in
part
in
this
case,
one
finds
some
700
pages
of
detailed
regulation
dealing
with
all
types
of
chemical
compounds,
all
types
of
containers
which
should
be
used
and
the
like,
regulations
which
make
it
almost
the
job
of
industrial
engineering
to
comply.
now
we
think
it's
obvious
that
these
regulations
are
intended
to
impose
a
responsibility
upon
management.
management
can
employ
the
expertise
required
to
know
and
understand
and
implement
these
regulations.
it
alone
can
engage
in
the
supervision,
the
discipline,
the
training
which
is
necessary
if
this
type
of
enterprise
is
to
be
carried
on
with
a
high
degree
of
faith
and
we
think
it
would
defeat
the
congressional
purpose
in
adopting
commercial
regulation
of
this
type.
if
it
were
a
defense
for
the
business
entity
to
say
as
i've
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
we
don't
know
whether
these
explosive
regulations
were
complied
with.
we
leave
that
to
the
assistant
dispatcher
or
the
driver.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
we
--
we
do
argue
them
and
when
we
think
with
considerable
basis
that
these
words
are
adequate
and
clear
in
their
purport.
certainly
we
don't
see
how
congress
could
do
better
than
it
has
in
222
(a)
which
in
the
very,
i'm
sorry
in
section
203.
now
that
that
section,
which
is
in
the
very
same
part
of
the
statute
as
the
misdemeanor
section,
defines
“person”
to
include
every
type
of
business
organization
and
we
think
insofar
as
18
u.s.c.
835
is
concerned
that
the
emphasis
upon
the
regulations
being
binding
upon
all
common
carriers
is
highly
persuasive
of
the
thesis
that
liability
should
go
where
responsibility
is
placed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
true.
we
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
it
was
sufficiently
clear
your
honor
so
the
--
dozens
and
dozens
of
district
courts
have
enforced
this
statute
against
partnership
entities
and
until
1956,
the
question
had
never
even
been
raised.
of
course
if
one
goes
so
far
as
to
say
language
isn't
clear
because
there's
been
litigation
that
--
i
suppose
one
couldn't
argue
plain
language
in
any
case.
we
think
this
is
sufficiently
plain
to
leave
your
honors
to
conclude
that
this
is
what
congress
proposed
and
we
think
the
whole
purpose,
the
whole
thrust
of
the
regulations
that
are
embodied
in
these
statutes
eloquently
support
that
view.
these
after
all
are
--
are
classic-type
business
offenses.
what
congress
is
doing
here
is
attempting
to
see
to
it
that
the
people
who
run
the
business
live
up
to
prescribed
standards.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
i
think
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
we
certainly
recognize
that
where
one
is
dealing
with
imputed
liability
they're
–
there
is
a
problem
in
the
criminal
law
and
that
--
then
it
has
to
be
kept
within
bounds.
and
we
have
no
quarrel
certainly
with
decisions
which
indicate
that
a
man
may
not
suffer
any
deprivation
of
liberty,
any
imprisonment,
without
a
showing
of
direct
personal
fault
or
causation
on
his
part.
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
principal,
where
the
principal
is
an
individual,
sued
as
an
individual,
can
go
to
jail
where
there
has
been
neither
knowledge
nor
acquiescence
on
his
part
nor
a
showing
of
something
like
gross
recklessness
on
his
part.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
under
18
u.s.c.
835
where
we
pursue
an
individual,
where
we
pursue
an
individual
partner
in
this
case,
quo
individual,
that
we
would
then
have
to
establish
his
personal
fault.
and
i
think
certainly
the
court
would
not
readily
hold
that
an
individual
sued
as
such
even
for
an
offense
arising
in
the
course
of
--
of
the
operation
of
the
business
could
be
imprisoned
without
a
showing
of
personal
fault.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
i
would
say
under
18
u.s.c.
835
where
imprisonment
is
a
possible
penalty,
if
we
were
to
sue
an
individual
as
an
individual
we
would
have
to
prove
personal
fault
or,
and
personal
causation,
a
direct
involvement
or
participation
by
the
individual
so
sued.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no
sir.
and
that
all
that
we're
arguing
here
is
that
where
we
sue
a
business
entity
that
response
that
a
case
is
made
out
as
in
the
criminal
prosecution
of
a
corporation
by
showing
the
required
conscious
violation
on
the
part
of
an
agent
or
employee
who
committed
it
in
the
course
of
his
--
his
business
action.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
on
that
point
certainly.
