mr.
selim
b.
lemle
if
your
honors
please.
initially,
i
would
like
to
see
where
i
can
put
this
case
in
what
i
deem
to
be
the
proper
focus
that
is
as
i
see
it.
i've
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
towage.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
this
is
not
a
towage
case.
it's
an
affreightment
case.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
an
affreightment
case.
towage
is
the
transporting
of
an
object
from
one
place
to
another,
it
puts
getting
there.
affreightment
is
carrying
a
cargo
it
has
for
its
basic
intent,
the
carriage
of
cargo
aboard
the
vessel
and
your
honors
so
held
in
the
sacramento
navigation
company
versus
salz,
which
was
a
case
on
all
force
with
this
except
for
one
point,
in
that
case,
the
towboat
and
the
barge
were
commonly
owned.
and
your
honor
has
said
that
in
that
case
although
towage
was
performed
to
the
barge,
the
object
was
to
get
to
destination
the
cargo
that
was
lading
onboard
the
barge
and
it
was
an
affreightment
and
not
a
towage
case.

u.s.
326.
now,
the
river
terminals
corporation
is
a
certificated
common
carrier
of
freight
for
hire,
not
a
tower.
under
the
act,
part
iii
is
regulated
on
the
part
iii
of
the
commerce
act,
interstate
commerce
act
and
under
part
iii,
a
shipper
is
permitted
to
furnish
a
vessel
as
a
part
of
the
facility.
that
is
specifically
permitted
under
the
act.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
reason
to
tow
the
barge,
peter
b,
from
reserve
to
texas.
nobody
wanted
the
barge,
peter
b,
in
texas.
what
they
wanted
was
a
cargo
of
molasses
from
reserve,
louisiana
to
the
port
of
texas.
and
the
river
terminals
corporation
undertook
to
carry
that
barge
with
the
cargo
on
it
to
port
from
reserve
to
port
off
for
the
purpose
of
delivering
the
cargo,
then
after
the
barge
would
come
back
right
to
new
orleans
and
pick
another
cargo,
so
forth
and
so
on.
there
isn't
any
difference,
if
your
honor
please,
in
principle
in
this
case
between
the
transportation
of
a
cargo
in
a
shipper's
barge
and
the
transportation
by
railroad
subject
to
part
i
of
the
act
of
a
cargo
or
a
lading
in
a
shipper's
freight
car.
the
object
is
not
to
take
the
freight
car
from
point
a
to
point
b,
the
object
is
to
deliver
the
cargo
or
the
lading
in
the
freight
car
from
point
a
to
point
b.
to
talk
about
towage
in
the
case
like
this,
if
i
may
use
a
simile,
would
be
if
the
--
a
--
if
a
box
tow,
refrigerator
tow
or
bananas
or
a
tank
of
molasses
in
the
shipper's
car
had
to
be
transported
from
new
orleans
to
washington
to
ring
up
the
railroad
company
and
say,
“send
your
locomotive
around
to
tow
at
ford,
washington.”
they're
not
in
towage.
it's
purely
and
simply
an
affreightment.
the
fact
that
towage
is
involved
is
purely
incidental
and
was
not
the
purpose
of
this
movement.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
that
we
don't
have
to.
the
court
of
appeals
sidestepped
it.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
and
if
your
honor
will
permit
me,
i
think
it's
a
point
that
should've
been
decided
that
these
are
important
points.
it
goes
to
the
very
basis
of
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
this
was
a
towage
or
an
affreightment
because
so
far
as
the
tariff
is
concerned,
the
same
rules
apply
to
affreightment
as
applied
to
towage,
so
far
as
the
exculpatory
provision
to
the
tariff
is
concerned.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
correct.
i
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
--
do
not
agree
with
it
but
i
have
not
raised
it
except
incidentally,
it
becomes
--
it
becomes
necessary
to
the
decision
of
this
case.
it
will
have
to
be
decided
but
on
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
a
towage
or
affreightment
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
tariff
controls
whether
it'd
be
affreightment
or
whether
it'd
be
towage.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
if
your
honor
please,
another
point
where
it
become
most
important.
if
this
be
affreightment
and
this
be
a
common
carrier,
then
section
3
of
the
harter
act
applies
and
section
3
of
the
harter
act
doesn't
do
anything
with
this,
the
exculpatory
clause
doesn't
too.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
any
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
the
--
the
--
yes,
sir.
this
is
a
common
carrier
and
if
the
--
if
it's
--
if
it's
affreightment,
section
3
of
the
harter
act
applies
per
se.
but
we
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
this
tariff.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
no,
you
would
get
a
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
--
you
would
get
a
complete
exculpation
so
far
as
this
cargo
molasses
is
concerned
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
so
far
as
that
--
the
cargo
molasses
is
concerned,
you
get
complete
exculpation.
now,
that
leaves
one
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
barge,
which
is
the
vehicle
in
which
the
molasses
was
transported,
is
subject
to
section
3
of
the
harter
act.
and
i
must
admit
candidly
to
the
court
that
that
causes
me
some
pause
because
the
bill
of
lading
which
was
issued
in
this
case
was
issued
for
cargo
molasses
and
said
nothing
about
the
container,
the
barge,
which
was
furnished
by
the
shipper.
and
so
that
if
--
and
there
are
three
cases
decided,
they
are
cited
in
brief,
in
re
o'donnell,
by
the
second
circuit,
the
(inaudible)
and
other
cases
in
which
lower
federal
courts
have
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
cargo
and
the
vehicle.
and
i'm
saying
so
far
as
the
cargo
is
concerned,
a
common
carrier
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
section
3
of
the
harter
act,
but
as
to
the
vehicle
--
no,
they're
tower
as
the
vehicle,
so
three
of
the
lower
courts
have
split.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
well,
the
common
carrier
is
to
boat,
if
your
honor
please
--
your
honors
in
--
in
the
cornell
steamboat
case
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
--
said
that
your
common
carrier
whether
you're
a
tower
or
whether
you're
a
freight.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes,
sir.
that's
the
line
those
three
lower
courts
state.
just
those
three
cases
cited
in
the
brief.
so
that
i
have
to
argue
the
point
of
the
validity
of
this
clause
so
far
as
towage
is
concerned
because
if
there
was
a
distinction,
i
want
out,
if
i
may
use
that
expression,
both
as
to
barge
and
as
to
the
cargo.
now,
turning
for
one
minute
to
the
interstate
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
well
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
case
has
two
ways.
yes,
the
record
does
permit
it.
yes,
it
is
permissible
because
(inaudible)
case,
trial
de
novo
and
i
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
--
except
for
questions
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
--
except
the
questions
of
fact
in
--
in
mcallister,
you
held
that
there
are
questions
of
facts
before
close,
but
mcallister
goes
no
further
than
question
of
fact.
i
respectfully
submitted
that
that
was
all
that
mcallister
go.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes,
sir.
the
issue
is
--
the
issue
is
open
in
both
courts.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
the
district
court
did
not
consider
the
question
at
all
of
whether
it
was
affreightment
or
whether
it
was
a
towage.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
the
--
it
was
before
it
and
it
is
raised
squarely
in
the
district
court
and
by
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
mr.
justice
tuttle
who
--
judge
tuttle
who
decided
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
says
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
correct.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
it's
open.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
come
permit
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
thought
i
was
very
familiar
with
the
act,
maybe
i'm
not.
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
has
any
reference
to
tonnage.
there's
no
question
of
tow
in
part
iii,
there's
no
question
of
tonnages
at
all
under
part
iii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
i
know.
a
certificated
common
carrier,
certificated
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
can
use
vessels
of
any
tonnage
that
he
chooses
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest.
what
it
said
the
other
day,
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
the
power
over
rates,
no
power
over
practices.
i
submit
that
specifically
given
to
interstate
commerce
commission
by
section
(f)
--
subsection
(f)
of
section
307
of
part
iii,
were
it
said,
“in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
prescribe
just
and
reasonable
rates,
fares
and
charges
of
common
carriers
by
water
and
classifications,
regulations
and
practices
relating
thereto,
the
commission
shall
give
due
consideration
among
other
factors
to
the
effect
of
the
rates
upon
the
movement
of
traffic
by
the
carrier
or
carriers
for
which
the
rates
are
prescribed
to
the
need
in
the
public
interest
of
adequate
and
efficient
water
transportation
service
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
with
the
furnishing
of
said
service
and
the
need
of
revenues
sufficient
to
enable
water
carriers,
under
honest,
economical
and
efficient
management
to
provide
its
service.”
that
is
not
cited
in
my
brief
but
that
little
point
is
coming
up.
now,
turning
point
in
the
bisso
case.
the
bisso
case
was
a
case
of
an
unregulated
tower
whether
or
not
he
was
moving
the
said
cargo
and
had
a
right
to
be
an
unregulated
tower.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
before
this
court,
i'm
not
arguing
the
bisso
case.
i'll
simply
point
out
that
the
bisso
case
does
not
in
any
way
affect
the
control
of
this
case
in
my
conception
of
its
interpretation.
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
black
was
all
with
the
court,
visualized
the
possibility
of
monopolistic
practice
if
a
tower
were
allowed
--
all
the
towers
were
allowed
to
hold
a
shotgun
to
a
shipper's
head
and
say,
“we
won't
go
of
you
unless
you
release
my
liability.”
of
course,
that
goes
out,
the
monopolistic
feature
goes
out
automatically
by
this
and
the
control
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
simply
said
that
it
didn't
--
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
say
opinions
of
the
same
thing
in
a
little
different
language
that
we
simply
don't
know
enough
about
the
economics
of
the
towboat
business
to
formulate
a
different
rule,
an
old
rule
in
syracuse
for
which
i
say
that's
correct.
but
here,
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
proposed
us
to
do
is
to
refer
this
matter
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
conduct
a
hearing
and
to
determine
what
the
economics
of
this
situation
require.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
if
your
honor
please,
i
submit
that
it
is
inherent
in
this
situation
that
no
carrier,
i
reiterate,
no
carrier
can
transport
whether
the
transportation
consists
of
towage
or
whether
it
consists
of
a
freight,
no
court
can
--
no
carrier
can
tow
or
affreight
as
cheaply,
offer
as
cheap
a
rate
if
he's
going
to
take
the
liability
of
the
loss
and
damage
as
it
canopies
he's
going
to
not
take
--
if
he's
not
going
to
not
take
that
risk.
if
here
we
have
a
rate
prescribed
in
a
tariff
published
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
which
the
shipper
takes
the
risk
of
loss
and
injury,
there's
nothing
in
that
rate,
the
marine
insurance,
if
you
require
the
carrier
to
take
that
risk,
then
this
rate
becomes
confiscatory
because
erroneous
close
up
to
a
point
where
you
can't
afford
to
do
it.
this
court
recognized
that
situation
in
a
case
which,
unfortunately,
i
did
not
put
in
my
brief
because
i
didn't
foresee
the
turn
that
this
argument
was
going
to
take,
but
in
the
case
of
the
consumers
import
company
against
kaisha,
something
relevant,
to
me
unpronounceable
japanese
name,
in
the
320
u.s.
249,
page
249.
in
that
case,
there
was
under
attack
the
fire
statute
of
the
united
states
which
will
leave
a
shipowner
of
liability
for
damage
which
occurred
to
cargo
by
reason
of
fire
and
that's
the
default
and
privilege
of
the
owner.
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
jackson,
speaking
for
the
court,
said
there
was
the
obvious
intent
of
congress,
and
that
far
--
that's
--
by
the
way,
was
100
years
old
roughly,
said
there
was
an
intent
of
congress
to
divorce
the
insurance
risk
with
transportation
rate.
that
if
they
did
not
--
the
congress
had
that
intention
to
--
in
order
to
secure
for
the
public
the
cheapest
transportation
rate
which
was
possible
that
it
was
obvious
that
if
you
loaded
the
cost
of
the
marine
insurance
in
the
transportation
rate,
the
transportation
rate
would
thereby
be
higher
and
you
would
be
penalizing
the
--
those
who
use
capital
carriers
as
against
those
who
use
carriers.
and
that
it
was
entirely
permissible
and
proper
to
divorce
the
two
rates.
i
say
that
is
the
situation
here
that
this
is
a
matter
for
a
study
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
there
is
no
reason
in
public
policy
or
otherwise
why
the
interstate
commerce
commission
should
not
determine
the
rates
and
the
practices
and
prescribed
rates
commensurate
with
the
practices
and
commence
--
and
prescribe
rates
which
will
afford
a
reasonable
profit
to
a
carrier.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
the
issue
of
the
i.c.c
is
the
reasonableness
of
this
rate
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
risk
of
loss
and
damage
is
on
the
shipper.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes,
sir.
this
--
this
particular
rate
--
this
--
under
the
--
and
the
rate
making
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
--
you've
filed
a
tariff.
the
commission
can
either
let
the
tariff
go
into
effect
for
accounts
of
its
motion
examine
into
the
reasonableness
of
rates
and
practices.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
no,
sir.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
correct.
a
shipper
may
at
any
time
even
at
the
rate
initially
goes
into
effect,
a
shipper
may
complain
of
a
rating,
may
complain
of
a
practice
and
he
may
have
it
suspended
pending
termination
of
its
correctness.
but
here
is
a
rate
that
was
in
effect
for
years,
nobody
ever
complained,
the
carrier
had
moved
hundreds,
i'm
counting,
to
say
thousands
of
barges
under
the
tariff
that
--
which
its
rate
was
published,
no
one
complains
about
it
until
this
shipper
undertakes
the
complaint
because
his
--
because
he
let
his
barge
stand
at
the
wall
for
more
than
24
hours
after
it
was
delivered
knowing
that
the
barge
was
leaking
and
the
tugboat
had
left,
he
let
the
barge
sit
there
until
it
sank.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
answer
that
question,
but
years
before.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
well,
i'm
guessing
10
to
15
years
at
least.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes.
i'll
answer
--
yes.
this
case
took
place
--
this
--
this
happened
in
19
--
this
actually
happened
in
1944.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
i'm
unable
to
definitely
take
issue
with
that.
it
is
my
impression
that
this
rate
for
many
years
and
it
dated
for
many
years
the
bisso
decision.
i
cannot
make
that
as
a
firm
statement
of
fact
because
i
just
don't
know
when
it
was
put
into
effect.
i
do
not
have
a
definite
one.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
no.
the
--
the
pertinent
provisions
of
tariff
was
stipulated.
perhaps
unforced
leave
was
done
in
an
attempt
to
keep
down
printing
cost
for
records
and
the
tariff
has
not
been
filed
in
the
record.
i
do
not
have
a
copy
in
front
of
me.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
--
perhaps
the
i.c.c.
would
have
one
but
no
one
place
could
be
gotten
because
the
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
they
must
have
one
on
for
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
1944.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
this
tariff
have
been
in
the
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
i
would
estimate.
i
would
guess.
i
don't
--
i
don't
use
the
word
guess
advisedly
that
this
tariff
had
been
effective
10
years
before
this
action
happened.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
well,
20
years
before
bisso.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes,
20
years
before
bisso.
bisso
was
in
1954.
that
--
that
happened
in
1944.
that's
10
years.
and
my
impression
is
that
they
have
already
been
effective
10
years
exactly
that
will
be
20
years.
this
isn't
anything
new.
this
is
as
--
this
is
old.
this
is
old
as
the
hill.
these
tariffs
--
these
tariffs
were
put
into
effect
as
soon
as
possible
with
interstate
commerce
act
was
passed.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes,
yes.
and
they
can
do
more
than
that
but
then
under
the
following
section,
under
section
307
(g)
of
the
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
--
interstate
commerce
act
or
part
iii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
if
the
commission
finds
that
any
rate
or
any
practice
is
illegal
or
unreasonable,
the
court
can
prescribe
a
reasonable
rate
and
practice
and
force
it
on
the
tariff.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
that's
on
part
iii
of
the
act,
that's
under
section
307
(g).
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
correct.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
from
the
commission?
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
--
i
answer
that
--
i
question
this
why.
the
bisso
case
did
not
involve
a
certificated
carrier.the
basis
of
the
bisso
case,
as
i
interpret
it,
well,
as
mr.
justice
black
who
decided
the
bisso
case
said
that
if
you
permit
a
--
an
unregulated
tower
to
require
a
shipper
to
release
you
from
liability
of
the
condition
precedent
for
towing
his
barge
will
give
rise
to
monopolistic
practices
because
they
all
do
it.
the
bill
of
--
the
rationale
of
the
bisso
case,
as
i
understand
it,
was
principally
the
possibility
of
this
monopolistic
practice.
you
don't
have
it
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
unless
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
require
a
carrier
to
put
in
a
series
of
rates.
and
most
of
the
carrier
were
having
the
series
of
rates
able
to
put
on
a,
b
and
c
rates.
a,
b
rate
is
a
legal
liability
rate,
an
a
rate
is
a
rate
under
which
the
water
carrier
waives
the
harter
act,
acts
of
god
and
everything
else
to
get
on
--
and
makes
the
liability
the
same
or
even
stronger
than
the
real
carrier.
and
a
c
rate
--
and
a
c
rate
is
a
rate
applicable
only
to
a
shipper's
barge.
now,
those
c
rates
stand
in
the
special
category.
the
c
rate
was
put
in,
if
you
pardon
me,
through
necessity,
regarding
the
matter
for
the
ship
--
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
putting
those
matters
of
necessity
because
under
part
iii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
shipper
is
permitted
to
furnish
the
barge.
carriers
don't
want
them,
they
got
their
own
barges.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
this
thing
i'm
talking
about,
the
sea
rates
in
the
folsom
background.
i
said
sea
rate,
a
special
rated
commodity.
this
is
the
rate
put
in
where
a
shipper
insists
on
using
his
own
barges
and
is
a
particular
kind
of
carriage,
one
in
which
the
carriage
would
prefer
not
to
engage.
they
have
to
because
the
shipper
permitted
to
furnish
his
barges
and
there's
a
reason
for
that,
any
real
reason.
the
carriers
maintain
many
of
them,
fleets
and
barges,
400
to
600
barges
and
those
barges
are
sitting
there
empty
and
available
for
use,
they're
not
tank
barges
in
this
case
because
the
general
rule
with
shippers
--
carriers
in
a
--
furnish
special
purpose
barges.
and
a
shipper
gives
you
a
barge.
it
gives
you
a
barge
under
load.
you
have
to
take
it.
literally,
you're
getting
a
periodic
boat,
many
of
these
barges,
are
really
many
of
them
are
literally
fugitive
from
a
junk
pile.
barges
which
some
of
them
have
been
bought
from
carriers.
carriers
retiring
from
service
many
years
before
and
you
get
a
barge,
you
get
it
on
to
load,
you
can't
see
it.
the
standard
barge
is
11
feet
deep.
you
got
to
put
in
there,
a
free
board
with
9.5
feet
of
the
barge
under
water,
you
can't
look
at
it.
you
don't
know
whether
it's
loaded,
rusted,
scaly,
leaking,
rusted,
scaly
or
what
it
is.
you
can't
go
under
the
cargo
compartments
because
they're
for
cargo.
you
can't
go
to
direct
compartments
because
they're
not
gas
free.
and
you
have
to
take
that
barge
and
you
have
to
tour
it.so
the
carrier
does
the
best
thing
he
can.
he
said
two
things.
he
says,
one,
“yes,
i'll
take
your
barge,
but
it's
your
risk
because
i
don't
know
what
it
is
and
i
can't
see
what
it
is
when
you
give
it
to
me
under
load.”
and
number
two,
“you'll
warrant
me
to
me
that
this
barge
which
you
overloaded
is
properly
loaded
and
is
fit
and
proper
for
the
transportation
that
we're
about
to
undertake.”
he
puts
both
loads
of
barges
down.
that
second
clause
is
quite
material,
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
and
proper
load,
i
submit
that
it
is
not
at
all
forbidden
by
section
1
of
the
harter
act
or
section
--
or
section
2
of
one
of
the
harter
act
says
that
a
carrier
owns
the
vessel
(inaudible)
to
make
it
seaworthiness
carried
over
into
section
3.
the
carrier
is
in
this
instance
is
not
the
owner
of
the
barge,
the
shipper
is
the
owner
of
the
barge.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
yes.
the
sea
rate,
as
i
say,
is
a
special
low
rate.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
only.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
in
barges
only.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
not
in
this
case.
in
all
of
the
cases
of
ordinary
commodities
which
are
carried
in
standard
barges,
the
answer
is
yes.
this
was
a
tank
barge
and
the
carriers
do
not
supply
tank
barges.so
in
this
--
north
railroad,
supply
of
tank
car,
supplied
by
the
tank
corporation.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
alternative
rate
because
the
carrier
did
not
afford
any
of
the
service
in
transportation
in
the
shipper's
barge
in
this
particular
case,
where
it
might
be,
again,
use
assembly
that
this
case
is
a
very
short
tail
of
a
long
dog
and
should
not
be
permitted
to
wag
the
dog.
we're
talking
here
about
one
of
the
biggest
transportation
features
in
this
country
which
would
go
in
by
leaps
and
bounds.
there's
the
mississippi
valley
barge
line
company
in
19
--
which
i
happen
to
know,
18
billion
tons
of
revenue
traffic
in
one
year,
revenues
of
more
than
$20
million.
that's
only
one
of
the
four
big
river
carriers.
so,
that
this
is
the
principle
which
will
come
out
of
this
case
goes
far
beyond
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
far
beyond
the
case.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
that's
true.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
if
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
if
the
icc
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
if
the
icc
--
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i'm
frank
to
say
i
had
not
gone
that
far
in
my
--
even
in
my
old
mind.
i'm
going
real
quickly
and
i'm
making
--
making
a
bad
guess,
and
i'll
come
to
this
just
in
a
minute.
i
would
say
that
if
the
icc
said
that
this
rate
was
unreasonable
and
that
we
had
required
the
shipper
to
do
something
that
he
couldn't
be
required
to
do,
he
could
then
start
an
action
of
the
law
where
you
can't
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
your
honor,
it's
correct.
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
i
think
it
expunged
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
(inaudible)
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
that
is
--
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
if
they
hold
the
rates
unreasonable,
it
will
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
pass
on
other
features
of
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
one
point
in
this
case,
passed
on
one
assignment
area
out
of
four.
the
three
assignments
the
railroad
passed
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
never
touched.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
no.
mr.
selim
b.
lemle
correct.
because
i
envision
this
case,
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
