that's
correct.
that's
absolutely
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
and
--
while
i'm
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
while
i'm
talking
to
you,
i
made
a
bad
guess
a
while
ago.
you
asked
me
how
many
years
it's
been
in
effect
and
i
guess
it's
been
in
effect
for
10
years
before
this
action
--
the
fourth
year,
the
interstate
commerce
act
didn't
come
effect
until
1940.
but
this
does
necessarily
must
have
been
filed
sometime
between
1940
and
1944
but
it
was
still
in
effect
15
years
before
this.
now,
as
i
--
as
i
--
this
--
that
brings
you
back
to
the
question
as
we
go
to
the
icc,
i
assume
that
the
icc
will
have
to
conduct
a
cost
study.
they
conducted
a
cost
study
in
the
el
dorado
oil
company
cases,
quite
a
lengthy
one,
and
--
as
mr.
--
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
was
the
author
of
the
court,
in
the
--
in
united
states
against
the
western
pacific
railroad
companies
said,
"there,
the
tariff
was
not
an
obstruction
and
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
have
to
look
at
the
rates
and
would
have
to
determine
the
rate."
any
rate
that
they
would
determine,
i'd
say
would
have
to
include
the
insurance
if
they
decided
to
make
the
carrier
insure,
otherwise,
it
would
be
confiscatory.
if
your
honor
please,
my
time
has
elapsed.
i've
only
touched
on
one
point.
point
one,
i've
never
touched
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
