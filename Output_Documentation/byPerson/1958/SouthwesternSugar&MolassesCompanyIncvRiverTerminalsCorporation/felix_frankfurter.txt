was
the
private
--
was
the
tower
in
bisso
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
administration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
would
he
have
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
tower
couldn't
do
business
without
filling
tariff,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
bisso.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
well,
then
--
then
the
jurisdiction
over
a
carrier
like
this
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
(inaudible)
justice
stewart
suggest.
there
is
still
a
difference
in
the
law
between
a
private
and
a
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
--
the
answer
to
that
--
to
your
question
may
turn
on
what
the
scope
of
regulatory
authority
or
responsibility
of
the
commission
is.
but
if
you're
right,
then
this
common
carrier
can
charge
one
rate
to
one
shipper
to
one
tug
and
another
rate
to
another
tug
and
it
would
be
surprising
indeed
if
that
is
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
reaching
your
exculpatory
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
addressing
myself
with
that.
i'm
asking
in
the
corporate
of
our
questions
were
whether
this
tariff
had
to
be
filed
and
live
up
to
him
the
service
done
by
the
tower.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
the
tariff
has
to
be
filed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
the
rates
which
they
filed,
the
tariff
which
they
filed
differentiate
between
the
kind
of
responsibility
they
assume
for
collisions
or
for
injury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
what
the
respondent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
the
law,
may
they
file
different
rates
for
different
services?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
this
case,
do
they
file
one
rate
for
non-liability
and
another
rate
for
liability
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
right,
what
you
say
it's
all
right,
your
right
is
contingent.
in
the
case
of
the
smaller
tonnage
tows,
the
dealing
is
entirely
between
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
case
of
the
vessel,
the
tow
is
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
there
to
say
this
is
an
unfair
rate
if
you
let
your
sales
out
for
liability,
but
if
the
fellow
wants
to
have
your
service
and
take
the
risk,
which
mathematically,
is
a
limited
risk,
that
comes
to
happen.
you
know
what
to
get
the
cheaper
rate
of
the
towage,
why,
that's
all
right
because
if
you
don't
like
that,
you
can
get
a
higher
rate
to
take
care
of
the
insurance
against
those
--
against
collision
or
injury.
in
other
words,
the
commission
is
supposed
to
represent
a
public,
does
represent
legally
the
public
interest
of
saying
whether
the
rate
and
all
that
relates
to
rates
is
a
fare
or
reasonable
rate
whereas
a
non-commissioned
controlled
tow
has
no
such
oversight.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
it
is
not
at
his
mercy
because
you
can
get
a
--
you
can
be
free
from
that
mercy
or
to
--
not
to
be
subjected
to
that
mercy
by
paying
a
different
rate.
look
what
congress
has
done
in
limiting
the
liability
of
the
carrier
or
regular
carriers.
they
can
limit
their
liability
almost
to
nothing.
but
they
must
offer
a
higher,
they
must
offer
an
unlimited
liability
provided
they
get
a
higher
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
would
agree
that
the
question
before
us
is
whether
under
its
regulatory
power,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
be
prohibited
from
a
allowing
a
tariff,
would
be
prohibited
from
legalizing
of
tariff
which
contained
the
exculpatory
clause.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
still
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
taking
15
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
commission
--
they
refused
to
let
them
file
just
one
rate
with
an
exculpatory
clause.
they
would
say
--
the
commission
may
well
say
as
it
does
in
the
case
of
railroads.
you
must
give
a
shipper
an
opportunity
to
pay
a
higher
rate
for
greater
protection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
your
--
i'll
get
back
to
what
you
said
(inaudible)
whether
in
light
of
the
bisso
case,
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
to
authorize
that
the
tariffs
to
include
no
matter
how
low
the
rate
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
differential
--
how
great
the
differential
to
include
an
exculpatory
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
harter
act
itself
is
an
exculpatory
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
wouldn't
get
a
complete
exculpation
under
the
harter
act,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
they
said
that
the
tower
as
to
the
vehicle
but
a
--
but
a
carrier
as
to
the
effect
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
for
purposes
of
the
harter
act,
had
these
lower
courts
held
that
it's
carrying
freight
to
wit
the
molasses
here
but
it's
not
carrying
the
barge
and
therefore
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
line
you're
taking?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
before
you
turn,
may
i
ask
whether
on
the
record
on
the
basis
of
what
--
what
is
before
the
district
court
and
what
is
before
the
court
of
appeals,
is
it
open
to
us
on
the
basis
--
is
it
open
to
us
to
sustain
the
judgment
below
or
rather
to
--
to
direct
that
at
least
the
harter
act
applies
to
the
molasses?
i'm
not
now
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
right
or
wrong
but
i
mean,
does
the
record
permits
an
adjudication
of
that
issue
on
the
(inaudible)
of
the
harter
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
longer,
no
longer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
is
the
--
was
the
issue
opened
by
the
pleading
--q
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
they
were
in
the
district
court
and
were
they
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
passed
on
it,
doesn't
considered
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
we
are
not
barred
by
the
fact
that
he
said
it
makes
no
difference
if
one
concludes
that
it
may
make
a
difference
and
that
questions
may
have
to
be
answered
under
the
harter
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
--
they
don't
have
to
prove
a
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
rate
--
rate
is
determined
valid
if
nobody
objects
to
it
or
if
the
state
don't
object
to
it
in
an
open
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
no
copy
of
this
agreement,
mr.
lemle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
not
a
copy
of
the
tariff
in
any
of
the
records
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
have
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
get
reparations
for
the
tariffs
from
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
this
suit
is
still
pending,
as
i
read
this
final

reparations
merely
go

rep
