if
this
is
under
the
i.c.c.,
do
you
have
a
right
to
file
a
suit
to
the
court
--

the
i.c.c.
and
subject
to
reparation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course,
i
had
--
i
think,
your
honor,
i
had
a
right
to
file
a
suit
in
court
because
after
all,
this
particular
person
was
a
charterer
of
the
barge
and
after
all,
he
owned
the
cargo
and
he
came
in
and
alleged
negligence.
now,
as
a
defense,
they
raised
the
proposition
of
this
particular
clause
in
the
tariff.
now,
it
comes
down
to
the
proposition,
is
this
a
legal
clause
or
is
it
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
excuse
me.
do
you
think
if
they're
right
that
it's
referring
it
--
to
all
they
confess
on
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
regulation
or
the
tariff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
--
then
if
they
held
that
it
was
unreasonable,
leave
open
the
question
of
negligence,
you
take
it
back
to
try
it
in
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
involved
in
this
case,
just
a
matter
of
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
little
different
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
if
they're
right
that
this
clause
is
within
the
power
of
the
commission
to
determine
the
reasonableness,
assuming
they're
right,
there
are
plenty
of
cases,
aren't
there,
that
is
old?
they're
the
ones
that
are
passed
on
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
saying
before
that
on
page
77
of
your
--
the
--
the
reasonableness
and
legality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you're
taking
your
position
that
the
formal
opinion
that's
decided
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
case
of
this
kind
or
at
least
where
it
was
not
a
common
carrier,
the
case
of
this
kind
that
laws
couldn't
fix
and
the
commission
don't
have
a
right
to
change.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
assuming
they're
right
that
it
comes
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
to
determine
the
reasonableness,
they've
taken
the
proper
course,
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
held
the
rates
unreasonable,
what
effects
would
that
have
on
this
case,
in
this
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
it
--
would
the
finding
of
unreasonable
rates
settle
the
question
of
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
