mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
before
the
court
today
involves
a
suit
that
was
filed
by
southwestern
sugar-molasses
company
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
matter
against
the
river
terminals
corporation
who
is
the
respondent
in
this
matter
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
at
new
orleans.
essentially,
the
suit
alleged
that
southwestern
sugar
&
molasses
company
was
the
charterer
of
a
molasses
barge.
and
this
particular
molasses
barge
was
towed
with
a
cargo
of
molasses
to
texas
city,
texas
where
the
barge
sank
and
as
a
result,
damage
was
sustained
not
only
to
the
barge
but
the
cargo
was
just
about
a
complete
lost.
libellant
alleged
a
certain
acts
of
negligence
on
behalf
of
river
terminals
corporation
who
towed
this
particular
barge
on
the
decent
question.
in
one,
that
they
failed
to
pump
in
sound
--
sound
the
barge
while
it
was
en
route
that
the
barge
lost
tram
en
route
and
was
taking
on
water
and
that
they
left
the
barge
unattended,
it
appear
in
the
texas
city
knowing
it
to
be
in
a
dangerous
and
sinking
condition
without
notifying
libellant.
the
respondent
in
his
answer
alleged
that
it
was
not
negligent
that
the
barge
was
towed
properly
from
the
terminal
at
reserve,
louisiana
to
texas
city,
louisiana
that
the
barge
was
not
left
in
a
dangerous
condition.
and
in
addition
to
that,
respondent
further
in
his
answer
raised
a
defense
in
respect
to
its
tariff.
river
terminals
corporation
is
certified
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
a
water
carrier,
and
they
did
file
a
tariff
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
to
the
rates
and
so
forth.
but
in
addition
to
that,
that
they
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
also
filed
with
the
tariff
the
following,
“when
shipments
are
transported
in
barges
furnished
by
owners,
shippers,
consignees
or
parties
other
than
the
carrier
such
barges
and
or
cargos
will
be
handled
at
owner's
risk
only
whether
or
not
--
whether
the
loss
or
damage
is
caused
by
negligence
or
otherwise.”
the
present
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
this
part
of
the
tariff.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
part
of
the
tariff.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
but
what
i
said
in
addition
to
the
rates
set
forth,
the
tariff
also
contained
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
--
this
provision.
and
this
provision
is
an
exculpatory
clause
in
respect
to
negligence
on
their
part.
the
case
was
tried
on
the
question
of
liability
only
before
the
district
court.
and
the
district
judge,
after
hearing
the
case,
entered
an
--
entered
an
interlocutory
decree
on
behalf
of
the
libellant
holding
river
terminals
corporation
liable
for
the
loss
of
the
cargo
as
well
as
for
the
damage
occasion
to
the
barge.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
district
court
held
that
this
particular
clause
that
was
embodied
in
the
tariff
was
against
public
policy
and
null
and
void
in
view
of
the
bisso
decision.
from
this
interlocutory
decree,
the
respondent
appealed.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
go
into
the
merits
of
the
case
because
they
held
that
there
was
a
defense
that
was
urged
by
the
respondent.
and
if
this
was
a
valid
defense,
we
were
out
of
court.
in
other
words,
if
this
exculpatory
clause
was
good
whether
or
not
there
was
negligence
or
not,
they
would
be
--
have
to
be
--
it
could
not
be
held
for
damages.
about
or
a
very
short
time
before
this
particular
case
came
up
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
there
was
another
case
that
came
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
mississippi
valley
case.
and
in
that
particular
case,
the
identical
exculpatory
clause
was
in
the
tariff
in
that
particular
case.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
also
raised
--
raised
as
a
defense.
and
in
the
mississippi
valley
case,
the
same
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
this
exculpatory
clause
invalid
and
of
no
effect
and
cited
the
bisso
case
decided
by
this
honorable
court
as
its
authority
for
so
holding.
in
the
mississippi
valley
case,
writs
were
applied
for
--
to
this
court
and
writs
were
denied.
and
then
afterwards,
when
this
case
--
the
present
case
came
up,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
they
had
made
an
error
in
the
mississippi
valley
case
that
it
was
their
duty
to
rectify
it,
and
they
proceeded
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
lower
--
reverse
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
lower
court
and
afforded
your
petitioner
here
the
opportunity
to
go
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
so
that
they
could
pay
us
on
the
validity
of
this
clause.
and
that
was
the
effect
of
the
decision.
and
from
that,
we
applied
for
--
petitioner
applied
for
writs
which
were
granted
by
this
honorable
court.
the
difference
between
this
particular
case
and
the
bisso
case
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
river
terminals
corporation
has
filed
its
tariff,
and
it
is
certified
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
the
bisso
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court,
bisso
had
filed
no
certificate
or
no
tariff.
he
was
merely
a
private
tower
but
the
--
otherwise,
the
case
was
the
same.
in
other
words,
it
involved
a
barge
that
was
damaged
that
was
towed
by
bisso.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
imagine
he
--
your
honor,
he
could
have
filed
a
certificate
but
he
did
not.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that
was
not
raised
in
the
case.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
it's
not
necessarily
that
they
file
tariff.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
it's
not
necessary.
it's
not
mandatory
that
they
file
the
tariffs
and
become
certificated.
bisso
did
not.
and
the
bisso
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
--
case
was
same
tonnage.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
yes,
that's
my
understanding,
sir.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
i
might
be
wrong
on
that,
but
the
--
the
only
two
distinguishing
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
--
the
only
two
distinguishing
features
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
--
i
know
that
the
--
well,
personally,
i
know
that
the
--
both
of
these
cases
came
out
of
new
orleans.
the
bisso
case
came
out
of
new
orleans
too,
and
it
was
of
the
tonnage
that
would
--
that
could
be
--
you
know,
would
come
under
the
--
another
certificate.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
in
--
in
other
words,
in
the
bisso
case,
they
had
written
in
to
the
contract
itself
that
the
tower
would
not
be
responsible
and
contracted
away
the
tower,
his
negligence
in
the
case.
and
in
that
particular
case,
this
court
held
that
you
could
not
contract
away
your
negligence.
now,
after
that
decision
and
wherein
this
court
specifically
held
that
you
could
not
contract
away
your
negligence,
these
towers
who
are
certificated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
instead
of
putting
that
in
some
contract
which
is
invalid,
they
turned
around
and
put
it
in
the
tariff.
in
other
words,
to
me,
it's
just
a
means
of
circumventing
the
decision
in
the
bisso
case
because
if
you
can't
put
it
in
the
contract,
how
can
you
take
the
same
exculpatory
clause
and
put
it
in
a
tariff
and
make
it
legal?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
only
thing
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
anything
to
do
about
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
oh
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
the
tariff
had
to
be
filed
but
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
--
there's
--
there's
nothing
that
--
pardon?
there's
nothing
that
requires
any
[laughs]
exculpatory
clause
in
it.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
yes.
yes,
sir.
it
has
to
be
filed.
and
here's
exactly
what
he's
--
has
to
show.
the
tariff
has
to
be
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
showing
all
rates,
fares,
charges,
classifications,
rules,
regulations
and
practices
for
the
transportation
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
between
places
on
each
route.
in
another
words,
what
they
filed
--
what
is
required
by
law
for
them
to
file
is
in
that
tariff,
it
has
to
show
all
rates,
fares,
charges,
classifications,
rules,
regulations
and
practices.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
that's
the
position
taken
by
the
respondent
is
that
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
no.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
they
can
file
different
rates
between
--
between
the
various
points
and
for
the
various
services
but
--
that
--
that
are
performed.
but
under
the
act,
the
act
merely
said
that
they
have
to
file
their
rates,
fares,
charges
and
so
forth,
classifications
of
the
type
of
rate
and
so
forth.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that
i
do
not
know.
in
other
words,
the
--
in
--
it
was
not
offered
in
the
evidence.the
only
--
this
part
of
it
was
offered
in
evidence
by
the
respondent
on
this
particular
rate
between
these
particular
places,
in
other
words,
between
reserve
and
texas
city.
they
had
a
rate.
and
in
this
rate
was
this
clause.
but
our
position
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
require
anything
other
than
the
rates.
and
then,
of
course,
if
someone
complains
about
the
rates
and
they
think
the
rates
are
too
high,
of
course,
you
have
the
administrative
relief.
but
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
done
in
this
case,
here
is
a
question
that
is
strictly
a
legal
question
whether
or
not
this
clause
is
valid
or
invalid.
but
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
now
sent
petitioner
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
this
clause.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
pay
us
on
the
validity
of
any
matter,
they
pay
us
upon
the
reasonableness
of
rates
and
whether
or
not
a
rate
is
fare
rate
and
whether
or
not
it
is
sort
of
discrimination
and
so
forth.
they
do
not
sit
as
a
court
of
law.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
if
--
you
can
do
away
with
your
own
negligence,
whether
about
contract
or
otherwise.
if
that's
permissible,
then,
of
course,
that
would
have
a
bearing
on
rates.
in
other
words,
it
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
rate
if
i
could
enter
into
a
written
contract
like
in
the
bisso
case.
if
i
could
reenter
into
a
contract
with
the
bisso
--
like
in
the
bisso
case,
if
that
contract
was
valid
that,
of
course,
would've
had
a
bearing
on
the
rate
because
in
the
bisso
case,
bisso
said,
“well,
i
can
do
this
job.
if
i
don't
have
to
carry
any
insurance
at
all,
i
can
do
this
job
cheaper.
and
if
i'm
not
responsible
for
this
man's
barge,
then
all
of
that
goes
into
the
picture
and
he
could've
charge
a
cheaper
rate.”
but
this
court
held
that
irrespective
of
what
that
had
to
do
on
how
much
was
charged
and
how
much
wasn't
charged,
that
you
just
can't
contract
away
your
negligence.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
thing
is
i
can't
see
where
it
should
--
you
could
take
--
see,
a
number
of
these
vessels
cannot
become
common
carriers
because
of
the
tonnage.
they
can't
come
on
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
why
should
you
say,
“now,
here
is
one
group
of
vessels,
they
can't
contract
away
their
liability.
in
other
words,
they
are
responsible
for
their
negligence,
but
because
this
class
of
vessels
who
can
become
certificated,
well,
it's
all
right
for
you.
you
can
just
put
that
in
your
tariff
and
you
can
do
away
with
your
negligence”?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
if
you
--
the
--
they,
of
course,
have
the
right
to
fix
the
rates
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates
and
so
forth,
but
--
but
can
they,
that
administrative
body,
allow
a
tower
to
put
in
its
tariff
this
exculpatory
clause?
in
other
words,
if
you're
going
to
have
people
towing
barges,
if
they're
towing
my
barge
and
they
have
this
in
the
tariff
where
they're
not
responsible
for
the
negligence,
what
--
what
happens?
they
can
go
on
all
and
leave
your
barge
sinking
not
notifying
anyone
as
happened
in
this
case
and
let
your
barge
sink
and
you
come
to
them,
they
ask
about
it,
they
just
lay
barges
and
say,
“well,
we're
not
responsible
for
our
negligence.”
so
it
puts
--
it
puts
the
--
the
person
who
has
to
obtain
the
services
of
these
tugs
--
these
towers,
at
the
tower's
mercy.
in
other
words,
he
--
that
fellow
has
to
move
his
cargo
of
molasses.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
there's
no
showing
in
this
record
by
respondent
that
he
charges
one
rate
for
one
and
one
rate
for
the
other.
the
only
thing
in
this
record
is
that
he
--
for
the
movement
of
a
barge
from
that
particular
place
at
reserve,
louisiana
to
texas
city,
that
he
charged
a
certain
rate
and
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
any
negligence,
period.
that's
it.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
what
is
that?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
right.
in
other
words,
if
the
common
--
if
the
towboat
is
--
if
they
furnished
the
barge,
in
other
words,
it
is
all
part
of
the
same
part
and
parcel.
in
other
words,
i
want
to
ship
some
cargo
and
i
go
to
the
tower
and
the
tower
furnishes
the
--
not
only
the
tug
but
he
furnishes
the
barge,
too,
then
they
see
his
barge
and
his
tug
is
all
part
of
the
flotilla
and
this
does
not
apply
to
it.
in
other
words,
in
its
tariff,
it
only
--
it
limits
it
to
where
shipments
are
transported
in
barges
furnished
by
the
owners,
shippers,
or
consignees.
in
other
words,
if
i
have
my
barge
and
i
furnished
the
barge
and
i
want
to
move
this
cargo,
i'll
go
to
the
tower
and
ask
him
to
--
what's
his
price
to
tow
my
--
if
i
furnished
the
barge
to
move
my
cargo.
and
he
charges
me
two
rates,
one
rate
for
the
towage
service,
and
another
rate
for
the
cargo.
in
other
words,
in
respect
to
the
cargo,
the
issue
of
bill
of
lading
as
it
was
done
in
this
instance.
now,
in
this
instance,
the
bill
of
lading
that
cover
the
cargo
of
molasses,
there
is
no
provision
in
there
nor
exculpatory
clause.
the
bill
of
lading
was
issued
in
this
for
the
molasses.
then
the
tower
charges
you
two
different
fees,
he
charges
you
a
fee
for
moving
your
cargo
and
he
charges
you
a
fee
for
moving
your
barge.
in
other
words,
he
forms
--
he
charges
you
for
two
services,
one
for
moving
your
barge,
and
one
for
the
bill
of
lading.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
my
--
my
understanding.
a
bill
of
lading
was
issued
in
this
particular
case
and
the
bill
of
lading
is
part
of
the
--
is
in
the
transcript.
and
i
believe
it's
an
appendix
of
respondent's
brief.
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
bill
of
lading
was
sent
up
as
an
original
document
for
this
court.
in
other
words,
it
went
up
as
an
original
document
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
sent
up
as
an
original
document
before
this
court.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
yes.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that
--
that's
the
entire
question.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
and
that's
what
our
position
is,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
--
in
other
words,
with
the
bisso
case
and
where
it
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
that
if
i
turned
my
barge
over
to
someone,
they
just
can't
haphazardly
take
that
barge
and
let
it
sink
or
damage
it
or
say
damage
it
on
--
on
purpose,
they
wouldn't
be
responsible.
in
other
words,
they
are
under
a
degree
of
care
with
something
that
belongs
to
me.
and
is
the
court
now
going
to
allow
the
same
exact
situation
to
exist
merely
by
the
subterfuge
of
taking
the
same
provision
and
instead
of
making
the
person
you're
dealing
would
sign
a
contract
to
tow
your
barge,
to
turn
around
and
put
it
in
your
tariff
and
accomplish
the
same
thing
that
was
accomplished
prior
to
the
bisso
case.
now,
this
court
thought
enough
of
that
proposition
back
at
the
time
that
writs
were
granted
the
bisso
case.
of
course,
at
that
time,
different
circuits
held
different
ways.
and
in
the
bisso
case,
this
court
thought
of
--
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
public
interest
that
they
granted
writs
in
the
case
and
after
hearing
the
case,
held
that
that
was
against
public
policy.
it's
the
same
thing
as
if
i
go
to
a
garage,
and
up
on
the
garage
they
have
a
sign
of,
“pay
parking
25
cents.
we
are
not
responsible
for
any
negligence.”
you
leave
your
car
there
and
they
knock
all
the
fenders
off
of
it.
you
come
back,
get
your
automobile
and
they'll
say,
“well,
we
are
sorry
that
your
fenders
are
all
banged
up,
but
didn't
you
read
our
tariff
up
there,
didn't
you
see
our
rate?”
and
if
this
thing
starts
about
people
contracting
away
their
negligence
or
doing
away
with
that
negligence
by
tariffs,
everyone
is
going
to
be
irresponsible
of
other
people's
property.
in
other
words,
it
will
be
a
pretty
sad
state
of
affairs
if
people
that
owned
barges
and
want
their
barges
moved,
they
have
to
have
a
move
and
the
person
who
takes
the
barge,
he
doesn't
care
anything
about
looking
after
your
barge
or
seeing
if
it's
sinking
or
what's
happening
to
it
and
he
takes
it
off.
it
might
be
--
have
sprung
a
leak
and
he
leaves
it
tied
up
to
a
wall
and
--
and
doesn't
notify
anyone
that
--
so
it
could
be
pumped
out
or
saved
or
whatnot.
what
does
he
care?
he
has
it
in
his
tariff,
he's
not
responsible
for
his
negligence,
so
he
can
do
any
sort
of
flagrant
act
of
negligence
he
wants
and
get
away
with
it.
now,
it's
our
argument
that
we
have
the
same
proposition
here
as
we
had
in
the
bisso
case.
it's
just
a
different
rankle
to
it.
in
other
words,
it's
approaching
--
the
tower
is
approaching
it
from
a
different
position.
they
didn't
like
the
bisso
case
and
want
to
get
around
the
bisso
case.
so
when
the
bisso
case
went
against
them,
what
did
they
do?
they
turned
around
and
instead
of
having
the
same
carriers
who
were
operating
under
the
i.c.c.,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
used
to
rely
upon
that
contract
with
the
tower,
the
same
particular
people.
but
what
did
they
do
when
your
contract
was
held
invalid?
the
same
identical
people,
the
towers,
they
turned
around
after
this
court
held
it
invalid
to
put
it
in
the
contract.
and
they
did
away
with
the
contract
as
illegal,
and
they
turned
that
around
to
stick
it
in
their
tariff,
the
same
identical
people
who
are
towing
other
people's
barges
who
had
contracted
away
their
liability
accomplishing
exactly
the
same
thing
this
court
tried
to
stop
by
just
merely
turning
around
and
putting
that
particular
provision;
the
exculpatory
clause
in
the
tariff.
so
--
insofar
as
the
public
policy
is
concerned,
and
it
being
against
public
policy,
this
court
--
i
mean,
it's
--
it's
the
same
thing
right
now
before
the
court
as
it
was
in
the
other
instance
because
the
same
thing
--
as
--
as
a
practical
matter,
the
same
thing
is
happening,
it
was
happening
before.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
of
course
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
can
--
the
only
thing
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
i
just
have
to
start
all
over
again.
and
this
case
had
been
going
on
15
years
now
and
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
[laughs]
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
the
attorney
who
filed
the
suit
passed
away
and
then
there's
another
attorney
who
took
the
suit
over,
he
passed
away.
in
the
meantime,
several
of
the
survey
has
--
what's
that?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
in
the
meantime,
the
texas
city
disaster
occurred
and
destroyed
all
of
the
records.
and
finally,
i
got
in
the
case
[laughs]
your
honor,
but
it's
--
the
case
has
been
going
on
because
of
the
death
of
other
counsel
in
the
case.
but
in
respect
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
about
$44,000,
the
cargo
and
the
--
but
your
honors
held
in
the
cornell
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
--
starting
at
32,
it
gives
the
history
of
the
cornell
case.
and
in
the
cornell
case
--
well,
even
starting
off
in
the
--
on
district
court
level
on
page
35,
they
go
on
to
state
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
that
of
regulation
and
not
the
question
of
liability.
in
other
words,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
nothing
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
nothing
to
do
about
liability.
they
are
strictly
just
a
rate-fixing
body.
and
for
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
send
this
back
to
--
send
this
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
for
them
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
this
provision
is
sending
it
back
to
them
as
if
they
were
court
of
law
to
pass
on
the
legality
and
the
validity
of
such
a
clause.
they
didn't
send
it
back
to
them
about
rates
or
fixing
rates.
here's
the
exact
language,
“the
judgment
is
reversed
in
order
to
afford
the
appellee
reasonable
opportunity
to
seek
administrative
action
before
the
commission
to
test
the
validity
of
the
challenged
provision,
otherwise,
to
give
full
effect.”
in
other
words,
they
are
sending
us
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
let
them
pay
us
upon
the
validity
of
this
provision.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
now,
where,
under
the
act
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
we
have
no
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
we
have
no
quarrel
at
all
with
that.
in
fact,
respondent
decided
a
number
of
cases
in
his
brief
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
the
proper
party
if
you
have
some
complaint
about
the
reasonableness
of
rates
or
--
and
so
forth.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
this
is
not
to
do
with
reasonableness.
it's
sent
back
to
them
to
pass
upon
whether
or
not
this
provision
is
legal
or
not.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
are
not
empowered
to
pass
upon
the
legality
of
various
things,
they
are
strictly
passed
on
rates,
but
the
fifth
circuit
sent
it
back
in
their
exact
language
for
them
to
test
the
validity
of
the
challenged
provision.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
the
--
the
--
well,
what
i'm
--
my
--
my
point,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
whether
this
rate
--
i
mean,
whether
this
provision,
exculpatory
clause,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
that's
reasonable
or
not,
it's
a
question
of
whether
that's
legal
or
not.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
yes,
sir,
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
a
person
can
contract
away
their
negligence,
if
they
can
do
away
with
their
negligence,
if
that,
as
a
principle
of
law,
is
right,
then,
of
course,
interstate
commerce
commission
can
very
well
take
that
into
consideration
of
fixing
rates
with
this
clause
and
fixing
rates
without
this
clause
if
that's
--
as
a
legal
proposition
is
sound.
but
the
court
in
the
bisso
case
said
that
that
is
not
a
sound
legal
proposition,
that
is
against
public
policy
to
let
anyone
contract
away
their
negligence.
and
because
--
and
we'd
have
the
exact
same
situation.
in
other
words,
it'd
be
doing
exactly
what
they
were
doing
before
the
bisso
decision
if
this
is
allowed.
in
other
words,
the
only
thing
they
have
to
do
now
is
whether
it's
a
private
tower
or
whether
it's
one
that's
certified
or
whatnot,
what
type
of
tower,
they
used
to
make
you
sign
that
little
contract
that
they
weren't
responsible
for
your
barge.
now,
if
they
can
turn
rather
--
pardon?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
sir?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
they
might
do
that
but
it
would
still
allow
them
to
--
in
other
words,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can't
force
them
to
--
to
do
anything
other
than
file
their
tariffs.
now,
they're
not
going
to
file
any
tariff
where
they
assume
any
responsibility
or
any
liability.
all
of
the
tariffs
they're
going
to
file
are
going
to
be
the
ones
without
exculpatory
clause
in
it.
so
where
is
the
tower
--
i
mean,
the
person
who
has
the
barge
then?
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
well,
if
it's
not
against
public
policy
for
a
person
to
do
away
with
their
liability,
i'll
get
back
to
the
same
proposition
that
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
amos
l.
ponder,
jr.
that's
my
position
entirely,
sir.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
