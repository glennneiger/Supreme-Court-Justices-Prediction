justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
--
excuse
me.
you
said
that
they
filed
a
tariff
and
in
addition,
they
filed
with
the
tariff
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
statements
you
just
read,
but
that
is
part
of
the
tariff,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
contained
that.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
going
to
act
as
a
common
carrier
on
navigable
waters
the
interstate
commerce
doesn't
have
to
file
the
tariff
under
what
is
part
iii
of
the
act?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
information
too.
what
surprises
me
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it's
implicit
in
your
argument
that
you
don't
agree
with
that,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
by
emphasizing
as
you
have
to
us
that
this
was
affreightment,
you're
implying,
are
you
not,
pretty
clearly
that
you
made
the
--
this
way
as
in
that
in
order
to
uphold
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
it's
clear
that
--
that
a
shipper
at
any
time
under
part
iii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
can
go
to
the
commission
and
complain
of
the
reasonableness
of
any
rate
or
any
--
any
provision
of
a
filed
tariff?
the
--
the
least
so
far
it
says
as
the
future
is
concerned?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
under
part
iii
of
the
act.
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
commission
or
from
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
commission
directly.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lemle,
this
is
the
--
we
call
it
the
sea
rate
a,
b
and
c,
and
this
is
the
sea
rate.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
cover
--
covering
barges
owned
by
the
shipper.
justice
potter
stewart
only.
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
there
an
--
an
alternative
rate
available
for
the
towage
of
a
--
of
a
barge
owned
by
the
shipper
--
a
higher
rate
not
containing
these
clauses?
is
there
any
such
rate
as
that?
justice
potter
stewart
one
other
question,
mr.
lemle,
if
i
may.
if
the
--
if
the
shipper
should
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under,
whatever
it
is,
section
308,
i've
been
told,
and
asked
for
reparations,
of
course
the
reparations
wouldn't
at
all
be
measurable
by
the
--
by
the
loss
that
he
suffered
of
his
molasses
and
of
his
barge,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
that
be
measured?
what
--
what
would
the
reparations
be
if
--
if
--
if
this
clause
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
assuming
icc
decided
this
clause
was
--
was
unreasonable.
justice
potter
stewart
unreasonable
part
of
term.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
icc
would
just
--
would
just
expunge
that
provision
and
they
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
--
and
the
lawsuit
would
proceed
to
the
district
court.
