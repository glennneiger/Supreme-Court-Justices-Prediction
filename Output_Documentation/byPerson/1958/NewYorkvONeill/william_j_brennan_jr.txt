justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bowen,
do
you
think
the
federal
government
could
pass
a
--
a
federal
statute
to
accomplish
what
this
uniform
statute
accomplishes,
namely
providing
a
witness
in
one
state
for
another
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
feeling
is
unless
it
can
be
done
as
done
here,
it
can't
be
done
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
bowen,
supposing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
is
wouldn't
be
a
full-pledge
of
course,
obligation
upon
virginia
to
recognize
the
order
of
florida
by
which
the
custody
was
turned
over
to
new
york
officer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
do
you
it's
no
valid
process
assuming
your
other
points
have
no
merit?
the
order
under
which
he's
committed
to
the
new
york
officers
by
the
state
of
florida
is
a
valid
order
of
the
courts
of
florida?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
would
be
the
case
of
--
for
an
extradited
prisoner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
that,
can
i
ask
extradition
case.
there
happened
was
--
you
suggested
what
might
happen
in
georgia
in
case
something
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
--
what
relief
in
georgia
could
the
private
citizen
custodian
obtain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
--
and
that
case
was
--
involve
a
waiver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
process
would
we
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
would
he
have
relief
in
georgia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
that
the
prisoner
then
escapes
and
the
custodian
gets
no
relief
from
the
georgia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
his
status.
my
question
was,
did
he
have
any
relief
from
the
georgia
authority
in
that
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mclean
hold
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mclean
hold
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
why?
doesn't
(inaudible)
has
been
a
clause
in
terms
embraced
judicial
proceedings
of
another
state?
unless
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
in
this
instance
--
in
this
instance,
the
--
the
custody
is
under
a
florida
court
order,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
would
stand
on
appeal,
there
were
so
many
statutes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
put.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
they
then
be
part
of
judicial
proceedings
for
which
the
courts
of
georgia
would
be
required
by
the
full
faith
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
quite
whether
i'm
correct
or
not.
i'm
looking
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
we
were
discussing
this
on
premise
if
you
had
a
valid
order
of
the
court
of
florida.
in
other
words,
you
passed
the
other
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
is
a
valid
order
in
judicial
proceedings
in
the
state
of
florida.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
on
that
premise,
why
would
they
not
be
binding
upon
the
courts
of
georgia
in
the
situation
that
justice
black
put
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
there's
certainly
an
invasion
of
personal
interest,
personal
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
could
be
accomplished?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
could
be
accomplished?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
what
is
that
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
that
--
that
only
means
the
witness
arrived
at
in
new
york
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
was
dragged
from
that
apartment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
work
here
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
decided
that
in
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what's
the
constitutional
authority
that
would
support
a
federal
statute
at
the
time
they
were
dealing
with
it
here
in
florida?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
one
deals
only
with
fugitives,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
deals
only
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
--
that
is
what
the
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
have
trouble
with
that,
frankly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
still
(inaudible)
of
any
crime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
way
to
extradite
him
for
a
crime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
couldn't
be
indicted
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
the
statute
itself
has
been
used
in
other
cases
at
that
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
any
event,
mr.
bowen,
there's
never
been
an
actual
hearing
in
any
of
the
three
elements
that
justice
stewart
referred
to
in
the
statute,
has
there,
and
since
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
you
should
prevail
on
the
constitutional
question
that
there'd
have
to
be
a
hearing,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
might
be
that
--
it
might
be
that
the
fact
finding
now
would
be
that
one
or
more
of
those
requisites
could
not
be
satisfied.
