mr.
reeves
bowen
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
in
this
case
is
as
to
whether
section
942.02
florida
statutes
unconstitutionally
interferes
with
the
right
of
ingress
and
egress
of
a
witness
who
is
subjected
to
its
terms
in
violation
of
article
iv,
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv,
section
2
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
section
is
an
integral
part
of
a
uniform
act
which
is
called
uniform
act
to
secure
the
attendance
of
witnesses
within
or
without
a
state
in
criminal
proceedings.
the
section
which
i
was
--
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
to
be
unconstitutional
provides
that
when
a
criminal
case
is
pending
in
a
court
of
record
of
a
state
which
has
an
active
reciprocal
legislation
and
the
judge
of
that
state
makes
a
certificate
when
it
--
a
criminal
case
is
pending
or
a
grand
jury
investigation
is
either
underway
or
is
about
to
begin.
the
judge
makes
a
certificate
to
that
effect
and
says
in
that
certificate
how
many
days
the
witness
will
be
required.
they
send
that
certificate
down
to
the
state
where
the
witness
is,
which
also
has
the
same
law.
and
there,
a
judge
of
a
court
of
record
procures
the
attendance
of
the
witness
before
it
and
he
has
two
options
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
it's
a
fair
interpretation.
the
judge,
if
there
is
a
recommendation
in
the
certificate
that
the
witness
be
taken
into
custody
and
bodily
delivered
to
an
officer
of
the
demanding
state,
the
judge
of
the
court
there
may,
if
he
finds
that's
a
desirable
thing
to
do
order
such
custody
and
delivery.
but
even
though
the
judge
does
not
find
in
favor
of
that
he
may
also
--
he
may
issue
a
subpoena
--
i
mean
a
summons
directed
to
the
witness
commanding
him
to
go
to
the
requesting
state
and
there
shall
appear
as
a
witness
during
the
time
specified
in
the
certificate.
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir.
if
i
--
there
--
there's
a
debate
that
was
heard,
but
actually
this
is
what
happened.
mr.
o'neill
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
illinois.
his
presence
was
desired
in
--
before
a
new
york
grand
jury
which
was
investigating
the
disposition
of
funds
of
certain
union
to
one
of
which
was
the
distillery
rectifying
wine
and
allied
workers
international
union
of
america,
and
mr.
o'neill,
who
was
the
president
of
that
union,
he's
the
chairman
of
the
executive
board
and
he
is
also
the
chairman
of
the
welfare
fund.
and
his
testimony
--
and
the
--
and
the
investigation
was
--
was
aimed
at
ascertaining
whether
there
had
been
embezzlement
or
a
conspiracy
to
embezzle
the
funds.
his
testimony
was
deemed
to
be
material
and
necessary
and
altogether
at
the
question
of
misappropriation
of
funds.
mr.
francis
h.
clark,
assistant
district
attorney,
made
an
affidavit
in
which
he
outlined
all
of
these
facts.
he
set
up
in
that
affidavit
that
efforts
had
been
made
without
avail
to
procure
mr.
o'neill
to
come
before
that
grand
jury,
to
appear
to
testify.
it
said
that
he
had
consistently
refused
to
testify,
that
he
had
--
had
rejected
all
of
the
pleas
that
have
been
made
to
get
him
to
come
voluntarily
and
there
was
no
way
to
get
him
there
voluntarily.
it
was
--
it
was
specified
that
they
needed
him
for
15
days.
that
certificate
with
mr.
clark
--
i
mean
the
judge
in
new
york
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
sir?
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
don't
think
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
there's
any
detail
given
about
why
he
was
needed
for
15
rather
than
10
or
20,
or
any
other
number.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
reeves
bowen
that
is
right.
mr.
reeves
bowen
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
the
judge
in
new
york
made
a
certificate
in
line
with
the
affidavit
and
annexed
the
affidavit
to
it.
and
in
that
certificate
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
act
of
the
law
--
of
the
uniform
law,
he
--
had
option,
that
he
recommended
that
mr.
o'neill
be
taken
into
custody.
it
would
--
had
--
as
--
as
a
ground
work
though,
the
--
the
affidavit
showed
that
while
they
haven't
been
able
to
get
him
to
come
they
had
found
out
that
he
was
going
to
be
in
florida
on
a
certain
date
to
attend
a
meeting
of
his
union.
the
--
this
certificate
with
the
next
affidavit
was
presented
to
a
judge
in
dade
county
where
miami
is
located
and
he
had
mr.
o'neill
taken
into
custody.
then
he
released
him
on
bond,
to
appear
before
him
at
a
later
time.
as
time
went
on,
the
--
mr.
o'neill
assailed
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
--
of
the
law.
on
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
for
a
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
oh,
yes,
sir.
he
said
his
present
counsel
represented
him
all
the
way
through.
he
assailed
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
on
the
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
no,
sir.
there
wasn't
any
subpoena
served
because
there's
got
to
be
a
hearing
under
this
act
before
the
judge
can
determine
anything
about
whether
to
give
him
a
subpoena
or
--
or
have
him
delivered
to
an
office
of
the
--
of
the
requesting
state.
and
--
and
the
judge
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
therefore,
there
was
no
occasion
to
--
to
subpoena
him
to
go
to
new
york
or
to
turn
him
over
to
an
officer.
mr.
reeves
bowen
he
had
him
taken
into
custody
and
that
is
also
authorized
by
the
statute.
but
he
immediately,
or
--
or
very
promptly,
released
him
on
bond,
and
later
when
--
when
the
--
as
the
law
was
assailed
on
various
constitutional
grounds,
and
one
of
them
was
that
it
as
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
reeves
bowen
on
both
aspects
of
it.
the
subpoena
part
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
--
and
the
custody
and
delivery
part.
mr.
reeves
bowen
and
the
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
no
subpoena
actually
ever
was
issued.
and
the
--
the
court
certificate
which
is
made
in
order
to
clarify
just
what
it
did
decide
in
the
case
specifically
ties
it
to
those
two
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
it
ruled
the
statute
unconstitutional
in
both
aspects
as
it
being
in
violation
of
--
of
privileges
and
immunities
clause
because,
says
the
court,
it
interfered
with
the
freedom
of
ingress
and
egress
of
mr.
o'neill
or
of
anybody
else
that
might
be
subjected
to
it.
now,
there
--
there
are
many
other
things
that
occurred,
but
essentially,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
believe
that
it
will
portray
the
factual
situation.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
--
i
suppose
that's
what
our
supreme
court
meant.
and
i
don't
think
anything
you've
said
actually
confined
it
to
that.
you
know
the
ingress
and
egress
doctrine
includes
freedom
of
movement
across
state
lines
and
within
the
state.
so
that
i
think
the
doctrine
embraces
both
the
facts.
now,
that
law
provides
that
when
the
certificate
is
presented
to
the
florida
judge,
he
must
find
that
the
witness
is
a
material
and
necessary
witness.
not
merely
material
but
a
necessary
witness
to.
and
another
thing
he
must
find
is
that
to
subject
him
to
the
inconvenience
of
--
of
having
him
to
go
to
the
other
state
to
testify
will
not
cause
him
undue
hardship.
and,
of
course,
those
two
things
must
be
determined
by
the
judge
before
he
has
any
authority
to
proceed.
there
are
some
doubts
as
to
whether
article
--
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv,
section
2
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
this
court
said
in
paul
against
virginia
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
say
to
the
states
that
whatever
privileges
you
grant
your
own
or
establish
for
your
own
citizens,
those
you
should
allow
the
citizens
of
other
states
no
more,
no
less.
and
in
maxwell
against
bugbee,
this
court
said
the
purpose
of
that
provision
was
to
prevent
discrimination
were
allowed
--
there's
no
discrimination
manifestly
because
the
law
applies
to
residents
of
florida
as
well
as
to
citizens
of
other
states.
but,
i
desperately
say
that
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
proposition
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
protects
the
rights
of
national
citizenship,
it
protects
the
right
of
free
ingress
and
egress
and
i
believe
that
if
there
were
no
constitutional
provision
on
privileges
and
immunities
at
all,
that
it
would
be
inherent
in
national
citizenship
that
the
right
of
ingress
and
egress
would
be
inherent
in
that
citizenship.
so
we
--
we
start
off
with
a
proposition
that
--
that
a
citizen
does
have
the
right
of
ingress
and
egress,
but
that
is
not
an
absolute
right.
now,
this
court
said
in
tumor
against
witzel
that
--
that
the
--
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
was
not
like
many
other
constitutional
provisions.
it
was
not
an
absolute.
and
there
isn't
any
question
but
what
everyday
a
state's
constitution
that
literally
restricts
the
rights
of
free
ingress
and
egress
in
various
ways.
in
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
because
if
i
understand
you
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
cannot
attribute
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
the
thought
that
florida
express
that
the
courts
of
florida
are
powerless
to
subpoena
a
witness
within
florida
to
come
to
the
court
without
violating
the
federal
constitution.
is
that
--
is
that
what
you're
thinking
of?
mr.
reeves
bowen
they
have
a
right
to
arrest
him
under
circumstances
which
it
required.
for
example,
he
was
subpoenaed
because
he
doesn't
come.
the
judge
issued
a
bench
warrant,
send
the
sheriff
out,
and
gets
him
and
brings
him
in.our
court
never
has
meant
to
say
that.
i
don't
think
they
actually
said
it
and
--
and
they
wouldn't
say
it.
and
the
question
was
brought
before.
mr.
reeves
bowen
run
throughout
the
state.
mr.
reeves
bowen
run
throughout
the
state.
mr.
reeves
bowen
arrest
warrants
can
be
served
anywhere
in
the
state
and
so
can
a
witness
subpoena.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i'll
have
to
say
that
we
have
no
statute
on
that
serves
to
my
knowledge.
we
have
no
court
decision
at
all
in
an
appellate
court
to
my
knowledge,
but
i
have
known
as
it
being
done
and
it's
assumed
generally
that
it
is
--
that
it's
--
it's
proper
to
do
it.
but
i
--
i
can't
vouch
as
to
any
supreme
court
decision
or
in
a
statute
which
deals
with
the
matter.
mr.
reeves
bowen
we
have
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
we
have
that
in
florida.
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir.
we
have.
mr.
reeves
bowen
we
have
that
statute,
writ
of
ne
exeat.
mr.
reeves
bowen
let
me
--
let
me
say
that
according
to
my
recollection,
the
writ
of
ne
exeat,
i
think
our
statute
probably
restricts
it
to
cases
involving
divorce
and
custody
of
children
and
alimony
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
haven't
--
i
don't
believe
our
statute
covers
that
sort
of
situation
and
i
have
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
have
never
known
of
--
of
it
being
done.
the
only
time
that
a
man
isn't
bailable
in
florida
is
for
when
the
charge
of
a
crime
is
where
it's
a
capital
crime
and
the
proof
is
evident
or
the
presumption
great.
in
all
other
instances,
he
is
entitled
to
bail
when
charged
with
a
crime.
he
is
not
entitled
to
bail
when
he
sought
to
be
extradited
as
a
fugitive
from
justice
for
example.
there's
no
provision
to
bail
and
our
court
has
said
he's
not
entitled
to
bail.
there
is
no
appeal
from
one
of
habeas
corpus
adverse
decision.
mr.
reeves
bowen
oh,
yes,
indeed.
we
are
--
we
operate
under
the
--
under
the
federal
extradition
statute
and
we
also
operate
under
the
uniform
state
extradition
statute
which
goes
into
appeal
not
covered
by
the
federal
statute.
for
example,
section
6
of
our
uniform
extradition
law
provides
that,
for
the
extradition
of
a
man
who's
not
accused,
the
federal
law
covers
all
the
fugitives.
a
man
who
commits
an
act
in
another
state
and
the
one
he's
charged
in
which
intentionally
results
in
a
crime
in
the
state
where
he
is
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
he
can
--
he
can
fail
to
perform
his
duties
to
look
out
for
his
defense.
and
they
could
just
--
we
haven't
had
that
decision
in
florida
but
i
have
found
decisions
in
other
courts
interpreting
that
feature
which
says
that
if
that
law
is
applicable
to
the
man
who
flees
and
leaves
his
defendants
behind,
he
takes
care
of
him
until
he
gets
going
and
--
and
maybe
for
a
while
after.
so
he's
not
in
the
demanding
state
when
--
when
he
actually
quits
providing
for
them.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
didn't
know
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
--
i
didn't
know
that.
i
--
i
--
would
confidently
urge
if
i
were
dissenting
that
legislation
that
it
has
a
very
sound
basis.
i
--
i
want
to
discuss
extradition
a
little
bit
later
or
somewhere
along
that
line.
in
coppage
against
kansas,
this
is
court
recognized
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
preclude
an
incidental
restriction
of
personal
liberty
and
there
are
ingress
and
egresses
personal
liberty
where
it
is
incidental
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
paramount
objective
in
the
public
--
interest
of
the
public
welfare.
in
panhandle
eastern
pipe
lines
company
against
the
state
board
of
kansas,
this
court
said
that
the
police
power,
and
i
believe
that
it
--
the
reserved
sovereign
police
power
justifies
this
act.
that
the
police
power
springs
out
of
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
protect
the
life,
liberty
and
property
of
its
citizens
and
to
promote
good
order
among
other
things.
in
(inaudible),
this
court
recognized
that
the
police
power
was
reserved
in
the
states
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
interfere
with
the
state's
police
power
to
adopt
legislation
which
looks
after
the
welfare
of
its
people.
i
think
there
--
there
can
be
no
question
with
what
i
said
with
this
court
in
queenside
realty
company
against
saxl,
that
the
police
power
is
one
of
the
least
limitable
governmental
powers.
now,
where
--
where
does
all
of
that
tie
into
this
act?
i
think
it
ties
in
because
it
is
a
question
of
necessity
which
is
involved.
now,
the
state
of
florida
adopted
this
law,
not
for
the
primary
purpose
of
helping
new
york
or
anyone
of
the
other
forty-one
jurisdiction,
the
forty-three
in
all,
which
have
adopted
it.
that
wasn't
florida's
paramount
purpose.
that
purpose
was
to
help
florida
and
the
--
the
investigation
and
prosecution
of
criminal
conduct.
florida
had
to
give
the
other
state
the
same
consideration
when
it
or
the
witness
out
of
florida
that
florida
was
looking
for
familiars.
it
just
acts
reciprocally.
of
course,
no
state
would
give
florida
a
witness
and
it
was
imperative
that
if
we
were
going
to
get
any
witnesses
from
other
states,
we
would
have
to
give
them
like
consideration.
now,
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
it
is
of
no
help
to
florida
to
procure
the
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
himself
by
either
arresting
within
--
within
his
own
bound
or
by
extraditing
from
another
state
and
then
tell
florida
you
have
no
way
of
procuring
a
witness
without
which
you
can't
prosecute
this
felon,
where
the
--
the
defendant
himself,
his
presence
is
utterly
valueless
to
a
state
unless
it
can
get
a
necessary
witness
from
--
from
wherever
he
can
be
obtained
under
this
act.
and
i
--
i
believe
that
it
is
just
as
important
to
permit
the
state
to
furnish
witnesses
to
each
other
under
this
law
as
it
is
to
furnish
him
a
means
of
extraditing
defendants
whether
he's
a
fugitive
from
justice
or
is
non-fugitive.
the
--
the
matter
is
--
is
one
which
must
have
legislation,
if
it's
to
be
held.
there's
no
way
that
i
can
conceive
of
that
two
state
or
two
or
more
states
could
arrange
for
swapping
witnesses
in
the
absence
of
legislation
as
along
the
lines
of
the
florida
uniform
law.
mr.
reeves
bowen
oh,
yes
--
very
--
yes,
sir.
it
doesn't
operate
in
new
york's
favor
or
by
its
various
terms
unless
new
york
has
adopted
a
reciprocal
provision.
mr.
reeves
bowen
this
is
uniform
act,
sir.
mr.
reeves
bowen
the
41
--
42
states
and
puerto
rico
had.
mr.
reeves
bowen
they
recommended
primarily
the
taking
into
custody
but
--
but
the
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
--
their
application
according
to
our
supreme
court
was
bold
enough
to
request
a
--
a
subpoena
request
on
that
offense.
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir.
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir.
he
--
he
can
say
no
to
that.
but
if
the
prerequisites
of
that,
he
can
still
issue
the
subpoena.
mr.
reeves
bowen
with
--
without
taking
him
into
actual
custody.
the
--
it
--
it
is
so
off
in
the
case
that
a
witness
doesn't
want
to
go
and
testify.
in
fact,
he
will
dig
in
his
heels
to
keep
from
going
and
testify
in
another
state.
maybe
--
it's
not
unknown
to
the
annals
of
history
that
witnesses
have
been
bribed
to
refuse
to
come
when
they
were
asked
to
come
or
--
or
of
organized
crime
is
a
big
factor
in
this
country
and
it
wouldn't
have
states
to
go
at
the
end
of
the
lengths
to
protect
its
agents.
it
would
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
sir?
mr.
reeves
bowen
oh,
it
--
it
covers
--
covers
the
landscape.
it
just
depends
on
the
size
of
the
(inaudible)
either
as
to
how
many
states
it
takes
in.
it
wouldn't
hesitate
a
minute
to
--
to
shuttle
a
witness
across
state
lines
to
avoid
having
him
in
the
prosecuting
state.
mr.
reeves
bowen
oh,
that
--
if
it's
any
--
that
if
it's
important
enough
to
them,
they
--
they'll
do
anything.
i've
even
heard
they
killed
some
of
them,
to
get
him
out
of
the
way.
but
--
but
certainly,
they
--
they
have
no
conscience.
they
--
they
(inaudible)
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
keep
a
necessary
witness
from
being
available
for
the
purposes
of
a
prosecution.
and
all
they've
got
to
do
is
shuttle
him
across
the
state
line
or
if
you
suggest
to
mexico
and
some
they'll
notice
at
the
state
prosecution
where
is
--
is
going
on.
because
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
so
long
as
they
don't
let
him
get
back
across
the
line
that
--
that
they
have
the
state's
powers
to
conduct
a
prosecution.
i
--
i
believe
that
--
that
it's
no
less
important,
the
states
have
a
method
of
procuring
witnesses
from
each
other
than
it
is
that
they
have
a
--
a
way
of
procuring
fugitive
from
justice.
now,
this
court
has
dealt
with
extradition
on
a
number
of
occasions.
respondent's
brief
takes
to
position
that
there's
no
power
in
any
state
to
legislate
on
extradition
save
as
that
power
is
conferred
by
the
united
states
constitution
and
statutes.
well,
that
isn't
what
this
court
said
in
innes
against
tobin.
the
texas
case
where
the
--
where
the
woman
had
fled
from
georgia
to
oregon,
she
was
extradited
from
oregon
to
texas.
and
according
to
the
wording
of
the
--
of
the
federal
statute
which
i
might
point
out
is
more
limited
in
its
scope
than
the
constitutional
provision
would
have
authorized
congress
to
enact.
the
federal
statute
authorized
extradition
only
from
the
state
to
which
she
had
fled.
and
she
had
not
fled
to
texas.
therefore,
she
could
not
be
extradited
under
federal
statute.
but
in
that
case,
texas
had
a
state
statute
which
was
invoked
and
she
was
ordered
extradited
under
the
state
statutes
which
--
which
was
wholly
undetermined
and
not
authorized
by
the
federal
statute
or
constitution.
and
this
court
affirmed
that
upon
the
proposition
that
the
congress,
by
not
including
a
provision
for
extradition
of
that
sort,
had
left
the
field
open
to
the
same
place
or
they
left
the
--
the
authority
in
the
same
place
where
this
was
then
before
the
words
in
the
constitution,
that
is,
in
the
states
themselves.
and
that
--
that
decision
was
not
based
on
anything
at
all
except
--
i
mean
it
just
--
it
did
one
thing.
it
upheld
a
state
statute
which
was
an
independent
enactment
not
dependent
upon
the
federal
law
for
its
validity.
now,
in
kentucky
against
dennison
which
i
don't
claim
to
be
in
point,
but
which
i
think
has
a
good
analogy,
this
court
recognized
that
even
without
the
extradition
provision
in
article
iv,
section
2
that
the
states
would
have
had
the
right
in
their
own
self-interest
and
as
an
act
of
comity
to
furnish
each
other
of
--
of
persons
accused
of
crime.
in
other
words,
make
him
available
to
the
fugitive
from
justice
for
example
without
benefit
of
any
constitutional
provision.
the
court
said
that
rather
than
--
than
take
the
position
assumed
by
the
government
of
--
of
ohio,
on
a
certain
point,
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
left
that
clause
entirely
out
of
the
constitution
and
left
it
up
for
the
state
to
--
to
have
and
no
one
else.
well
now,
if
the
states
--
and
i
think
that
case
is
clearly
authority
for
that
--
would
have
had
the
--
the
power
to
enact
legislation
for
the
surrender
of
fugitive
one
to
the
other
without
any
federal
constitutional
provision.
if
they're
to
have
that
power,
why
then
do
they
not
have
the
correlative
power
to
legislate
so
as
to
pass
witnesses
back
and
forth
because
without
witnesses,
there
can
be
no
defense
against
crime.
you
cannot
curb
or
--
or
punish
crime
unless
you
got
the
witnesses
to
do
it
with.
now,
to
get
a
--
a
hold
to
these
venues
of
that
--
that
you
mentioned,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
about
the
uniform
state
of
extradition
law,
i
believe
that
comes
from
the
doctrine
of
innes
against
tobin.
that
where
the
federal
congress
when
in
the
first
place,
the
--
the
united
states
constitution
deals
only
with
fugitives.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
it
but
--
and
the
statute
likewise
to
this.
but
take
the
innes
case
and
the
--
and
the
kentucky
against
dennison
cases
together
and
they
seem
to
mean
that
since
it
is
not
covered
by
federal
law
in
any
way,
and
since
the
states
have
the
inherent
power
to
do
it
while
the
federal
law
has
not
preempted
the
field,
while
then
the
--
they
would
have
the
right
to
pass
that
uniform
state
of
extradition
law.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
have
some
question
in
my
mind
about
the
power
of
the
congress
to
do
it
because
it's
not
in
aid
of
any
federal
governmental
power.
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
a
statement.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
don't
know
of
any
way
to
suggest
that
it
can
be
done
except
in
this
fashion.
mr.
reeves
bowen
well,
it
might
be
that
a
compact
would
be
upheld
by
this
court.
it's
never
been
--
this
particular
type
of
situation
has
never
been
before
the
court.
the
--
the
--
some
of
the
state
courts
have
held
that
these
statutes
are
not
compacts
and
indeed
i
don't
think
they
meet
the
--
the
required
--
the
definition
of
compact
that
this
court
has
laid
down.
mr.
reeves
bowen
to
order
--
to
order
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
you
mean
an
officer
of
one
state
going
to
another
state
and
try
to
subpoena?
mr.
reeves
bowen
there
may
have
been,
your
honor.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
--
i
don't
know
of
one
of
that
kind
but
it
--
there
may
have
been.
mr.
reeves
bowen
it
--
it
would
be
quite
a
tremendous
job
and
i'll
tell
you
what
would
--
would
heighten
the
difficulties.
a
careful
reading
--
i
can't
say
i've
read
them
all
but
i've
looked
at
uniform
laws,
annotated.
i
would
suppose,
point
out
the
differences
between
the
several
states
even
adopting
this
statute,
be
a
little
modern
day
(inaudible)
one
state
will
--
will
add
a
little
thought
here
and
take
off
one
there,
that
the
other
states
leave
in.
and
if
you
can't
get
forty-three
jurisdictions
to
it
to
enact
the
identically
the
same
statute
in
words,
it
--
it
would
be
even
harder
to
get
them
to
sign
up
for
a
written
agreement
for
example,
on
the
same
thing.
mr.
reeves
bowen
no,
sir.
i
--
i
meant
to
say
just
now
that
there
were
minor
variations.
mr.
reeves
bowen
this
--
this
statute
here
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
that
could
be
so.
but
basic
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
--
but
basically,
the
fundamental
framework
of
it
i
think
is
the
same
with
all
the
states.
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question,
a
serious
question
be
raised
about
the
fact.
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir,
i
can
tell
you
one.
in
florida,
section
942.01
gives
some
definition.
it
--
the
--
the
uniform
law
as
it
was
first
recommended
by
the
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
legislation,
defined
--
i
believe
that
the
word
"prosecution"
--
anyway,
the
--
the
scope
of
that,
is
what
it
had
to
do
with
it.
and
it
--
it
said
that
--
that
you
in
effect
--
the
effect
while
that
you
could
get
witnesses
in
any
prosecution
or
grand
jury
investigation
and
the
florida
legislature
added
the
words,
“held
by
the
state
or
defendant”.
mr.
reeves
bowen
or
the
defendant.
i
say
that
they
added
the
words
"held
by
the
state
or
the
defendant".
what
they
apparently
meant
was
to
try
--
was
to
make
the
act
available
to
a
defendant
as
well
as
to
the
state.
now,
of
course,
that
part
of
it,
insofar
as
the
defendant's
rights
are
concerned,
would
depend
upon,
if
it
--
if
florida
wanted
a
--
a
witness
from
new
york
for
a
defense
in
florida,
and
if
new
york
didn't
--
had
not
added
such
a
provision
as
that,
why
of
course,
florida
couldn't
get
him
because
there's
no
reciprocal
operation
as
to
that
one
thing.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
don't
recall
having
noted
anything
of
that
sort.
frankly,
i
have
analyzed
the
whole
thing
and
--
and
uniform
laws
annotated
but
--
but
i
--
certainly,
nothing
of
that
sort
made
an
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
--
impression
on
me.
mr.
reeves
bowen
and
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
think
that
--
that
it
--
you
have
probably
be
found
that
the
act
is
exactly
the
same
words
everywhere,
are
on
the
--
the
question
of
arresting
and
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
--
taking
him
into
custody.
mr.
reeves
bowen
it
is
--
it
is
imperative
for
this
reason.
mr.
reeves
bowen
because
you
take
in
this
case
right
here,
mr.
o'neill.
the
chances
are
very
good.
there's
enough
showing
laid
out
in
the
certificate,
and
mr.
clark's
next
affidavit
to
cast
serious
doubt
upon
whether
mr.
o'neill
would
have
gone
to
new
york
if
you
just
issued
him
a
subpoena.
illinois
doesn't
have
this
reciprocal
act,
they
have
it
enacted.
all
he
had
to
have
done
to
get
a
subpoena
was
to
catch
a
plane
back
to
illinois
and
--
and
he
would
have
been
safe.
as
long
as
he
stayed
out
in
florida
and
new
york,
nobody
could
touch
him.
nobody
could
make
him
go
to
new
york
to
testify.
nobody
could
punish
him
for
not
obeying
that
subpoena.
so
--
and
--
and
there
are
many
instances
i
can
conceive
of.
for
example,
where
a
crime
syndicate
is
put
in
the
pressure
to
get
a
witness
out
of
the
state,
if
you
don't
grab
that
witness
and
hold
him
and
turn
him
over
to
an
officer,
he
isn't
going
to
stick
around
just
for
being
subpoenaed.
he'll
--
he
--
he'll
leave
the
state
and
then
you
can't
punish
him
for
anything
if
he
leaves
the
state
and
--
and
leave
you
helpless.
mr.
reeves
bowen
exactly.
if
he'd
stayed
in
--
in
illinois,
he
had
taken
the
plane
to
illinois
and
--
and
stayed
there
--
and
--and
unless
and
until
illinois
adopted
the
act,
that'd
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
reeves
bowen
well,
sir,
that
would
impose
a
problem.
certainly,
if
in
a
state
which
has
enacted
the
law,
it
seems
to
me
has
put
its
stamp
of
approval
upon
the
matter
but
i
believe
the
--
what,
the
equivalent
of
article
942.05,
i
think
that's
the
section
which
guarantees
him
that
the
--
the
right
of
arrest
while
on
--
on
social
process
while
going
through
that
state
and
--
and
all
the
states
have
adopted
it,
it
seems
to
me
like
or
even
without
any
expressed
provision.
let's
say
he
came
to
virginia,
and
virginia
has
this
law.
and
the
question
arises
in
virginia.
he
--
he
just
asked
again
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
virginia
court
and
he
raises
the
question
of
what
right
does
a
new
york
officer
has
got
to
detain
him
in
virginia?
well,
virginia
having
the
self
same
act,
i
believe
would
necessarily
reject
that
claim.
mr.
reeves
bowen
there
might
well
be,
sir.
that's
the
thought
that
i
haven't
had.
but
it
--
it
might
well
be
this
full
pledge
and
credit
would
require
recognition
of
--
of
that
order.
but
--
but
--
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
that
if
virginia
had
the
law
that
it
--
it
--
it
has
impliedly,
at
least,
said
to
the
officer
in
new
york,
"you
can
bring
this
man
from
florida
through
here
and
we
won't
interfere
with
it."
i
believe
that's
the
necessary
indication
of
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
well,
there
could
be
a
problem
arise
if
that
situation
should
come
up.
there
will
--
could
be
a
--a
real
problem
involved.
i'll
say
this
though.
of
course
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
and
it's
something
i
didn't
know
that
the
--
the
court
had
before
this
uniform
criminal
extradition
law
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
well,
let's
(inaudible)
that
resorted
to
for
that
purpose.
mr.
reeves
bowen
and
some
--
some
states
of
course
have
upheld
that
application
of
it.
but
under
that
act,
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
all
of
the
states
have
adopted
it.
i
put
it
in
my
brief
how
many
had.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
about
40
or
a
little
bit
more
but
less
than
all
i
believe.
and
there's
been
no
problem
which
has
arisen
concerning
the
question
of
whether
the
agent
of
the
demanding
state
had
the
right
to
the
custody
of
the
prisoner
or
not.
i've
never
run
across
that
in
any
court
decisions.
it's
--
his
right
to
the
custody
has
been
honored
apparently
in
every
state
through
which
he
has
gone.
mr.
reeves
bowen
sir,
as
i
said,
the
--
the
suggestion
taught
me
things
that
i
have
never
considered
that.
it
sounds
good
to
--
i
have
researched.
i
don't
know
where
i
could
find
any
law
and
if
i
did
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
they
sound
less
on
principle.
i
say
if
that
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
--
i
--
don't
think
the
other
question
is
--
is
necessary
to
be
considered
in
this
connection
of
this
case
that
because
no
such
question
is
before
the
court
as
i
see
it.
let
me
give
you
one
more
attack
on
this
question
of
necessity
for
--
for
--
getting
the
witness.
most
--
every
one
of
the
states
have
the
confrontation
which
requires
discretion
of
presence
of
the
witness
so
that
the
defendant
could
confront.
in
--
in
most
of
the
states
i
understand
that
that's
backed
up
by
a
constitutional
guarantee,
by
the
state's
constitution.
well,
if
--
and
you
can't
use
a
deposition
against
that
no
matter
if
you've
got
the
one
witness
that
saw
the
determinate
--
shoot
the
--
the
--
murdered
person
down.
and
the
only
one
that
you
can
tie
him
to
the
crime
at
all
maybe
--
and
that
witness
is
in
alabama
and
we
want
him
in
florida,
we
can't
use
the
deposition.
we
--
we
got
to
get
the
witness
into
florida.
and
that's
the
way
it
is
in
most,
all
of
the
states.
now,
you
might
say
of
course,
that
that
rule
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
a
grand
jury
investigation,
but
it's
my
information
that
many
of
the
states
don't
permit
--
the
law
doesn't
permit
the
use
of
deposition
for
venues.
we
never
heard
of
it
in
florida,
never
heard
of
a
deposition
for
a
grand
jury
against
the
defendants
at
all.
it
has
bee
been
in
our,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
aware.
now,
the
defendant
himself
can
take
deposition
to
be
used
at
his
trial
but
the
state
can't
do
this
just
to
put
the
witness
before
him
to
confront
him
and
so
he
can
be
cross-examined.
and
there
--
there
is
still
another
thought
on
that
matter.
if
you
could
use
deposition
in
all
similar
proceedings
against
a
defendant,
they
are
noted
for
not
being
of
anything
like
equal
value
to
the
life,
flesh
and
blood
of
the
witness
who
comes
up
before
that
jury,
they
can
see
him
and
hear
the
sound
of
his
voice.
they
can
evaluate
him
and
--
and
could
work
on
his
testimony,
yet
utterly
impossible
in
a
deposition.
so
--
so
you
take
two
educated
people,
one
inherent
liar
and
the
other
a
person,
a
truthful
man
and
you
let
them
make
a
deposition
and
one
of
them
lied
about
the
truth,
while
another
tells
the
truth,
this
usually
--
they'll
--
in
the
--
in
the
deposition
and
will
disclose
which
one
is
the
truthful
man
and
which
one
is
not.
mr.
reeves
bowen
and
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
and
i'll
go
to
that
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
florida
added
a
provision,
the
94101
the
definition
which
i
construe
to
extend
its
benefits
to
the
defendant,
but
that
is
not
the
original
proposed
uniform
law
and
that
is
not
the
provision
that
was
adopted
by
most
of
the
jurisdictions.
in
fact,
insofar
as
i'm
aware
it's
unique
to
florida.
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir.
that
(inaudible)
sense,
that's
my
interpretation.
mr.
reeves
bowen
the
supreme
court
of
florida
called
attention
to
that
in
its
opinion.
mr.
reeves
bowen
it
mentioned
that
and
--
and
i
made
the
argument
there
somewhat
like
a
--
may
get
on
the
same
general
lines
that
--
that
it
would
justify,
as
a
matter
of
necessity,
in
order
to
enable
a
state
to
protect
its
citizens
against
crime
and
to
preserve
safety
and
good
order
of
society.
and
in
endeavoring
to
cast
it
down
on
that,
mr.
justice
thomas
who
wrote
the
opinion
made
some
observations
which
tended
to
give
that
and
he
felt
there
was
nothing
to
my
argument
because
it
was
also
available
to
the
defendant
under
this
particular
added
clause
in
the
florida
statute.
but
whether
it's
available
to
the
defendant
or
not,
to
my
mind
in
the
least,
detract
from
the
power
of
the
state
to
protect
itself
--
its
citizens
against
crime
by
enacting
this
law,
regardless
of
its
application
to
the
defense.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
--
those
are
the
questions
i
think
is
before
the
court,
purely
a
question
of
ingress
and
egress
is
what
the
certificate
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
they
decided.
that's
the
only
thing
i
briefed.
it's
the
only
thing
i
came
here
to
argue
and
i
believe
that
includes
my
argument,
unless
i
should
have
an
opportunity
to
make
some
rebuttal,
and
desire
to
do
it.
with
that
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
think
the
case
is
moot.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
said
i
don't
think
this
case
is
moot
because
if
this
court
--
court
of
the
state
of
florida
has
swung
in
the
balance
the
question
of
whether
it
can
collect
that
bond
or
not.
if
the
decision
is
reversed,
then
--
and
mr.
o'neill
doesn't
show
up
whenever
--
when
he's
demanded,
then
the
bond
will
be
mistreated
and
if
he
doesn't
show
up,
it
can
be
collected.
but
if
the
court
should
dismiss
the
case
as
being
moot,
then
florida
is
automatically
cutoff
from
collecting
that
bond
because
it
would
leave
in
effect
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
and
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
saying
they
have
no
right
to
--
to
do
anything
to
him
at
all.
we'd
--
we'd
lose
the
right
to
collect
the
bond
we
are
entitled
have.
if
this
thing
is
reversed,
we're
entitled
to
have
him
or
the
bond
money.
and
--
and
a
dismissal
would
cut
us
off
from
the
possibility
of
getting
either
one.
it's
always
possible
that
a
man
will
get
to
feel
like
he
--
he's
small
enough
to
slip
in
and
out
of
state
and
try
--
and
--
and
have
another
dash
down,
then
they'd
catch
him
again.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
don't
remember,
sir.
mr.
reeves
bowen
$2500.
now,
let
me
say
this.
some
question
was
raised
about
what
could
be
heard
if
this
thing
is
reversed.
the
question
can
be
heard
under
the
law
as
to
whether
mr.
o'neill
is
a
material
and
necessary
witness
because
our
statute
requires
the
judge
to
determine
that
fact.
and
if
mr.
o'neill
is
able
to
show
our
judge
down
there
that
he
is
not
a
material
witness
in
spite
all
these
positions
that
he
holds
in
the
union,
the
head
of
all
or
most
everything
in
it,
and
in
spite
of
that,
he
knows
nothing
about
the
--
the
facts
that
the
grand
jury
is
trying
to
investigate
up
there.
then
if
the
judge
finds
that
to
be
true,
he
will
necessarily
find
that
he's
not
a
necessary
witness
and
he
won't
--
he
--
he
can't
under
the
law,
hold
him
to
set
up.
i
think
that
question
is
certainly
open
for
consideration
if
this
case
should
be
reversed.
now,
mr.
cushman
still
contends
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
do
not,
i'm
sorry.
i
have
him
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
it
was,
sir.
it
was.
mr.
reeves
bowen
well,
they
--
they
have
--
if
they
don't
have
that,
well,
i'm
sure
they've
got
a
successor
grand
jury.
mr.
reeves
bowen
he
hasn't
been
summoned
to
appear
before
any
grand
jury
so
far.
in
other
words,
no
action
has
been
taken
to
require
him
to
go
before
any
grand
jury.
mr.
reeves
bowen
yes,
sir,
but
--
now,
if
a
subpoena
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
if
a
subpoena
has
been
issued
to
him
back
then
in
1956
when
this
case
was
decided
in
the
circuit
court,
and
if
--
while
the
case
was
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
it
had
made
--
made
to
appear
that
the
body
before
whom
the
subpoena
was
returnable,
that
is
the
grand
jury,
had
ceased
to
exist.
then,
the
hauling
would
have
to
have
been
in
his
favor
as
to
that
particular
subpoena,
but
here
we've
had
no
subpoena
at
all.
and
i
don't
know
actually
whether
the
same
grand
jury
has
been
in
session
or
not.
i
--
some
of
these
grand
juries
last
a
long
time
but
i
don't
know
about
that
one.
but
even
so,
it
says
no
subpoena
has
been
issued
which
could
have
been
vitiated
by
the
--
by
the
expiration
of
that
grand
jury
term
and
says
new
york
still
wants
him
before
a
grand
jury
and
a
subpoena
could
be
issued
to
put
him
before
a
current
grand
jury.
mr.
reeves
bowen
no
--
no
subpoena
has
ever
been
issued.
mr.
reeves
bowen
they
have
not.
he
--
he'd
be
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
the
basis
of
course,
new
york
asked
that
he'd
be
sent
there
once
if
they'll
go
have
a
term
of
grand
jury
and
they
already
had
one,
i
believe,
in
session,
that
they
were
investigating
the
disposition
of
funds
in
the
union,
certain
unions
including
mr.
o'neill's
union.
and
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
they
asked
for
him
to
come.
they
wanted
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
reeves
bowen
that's
right.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
hadn't
considered
that
but
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
it
says
new
york
still
wants
him
before
a
grand
jury.
that
it's
utterly
immaterial
whether
they
put
him
before
that
grand
jury
that
was
in
session
in
1956
or
whether
they
put
him
before
a
new
--
new
grand
jury.
they
--
i
--
i
couldn't
state
a
fact
that
more
adequately
attest
to
the
fact
that
new
york
wants
him
than
to
point
out
all
the
expense
and
effort
it
has
made
to
get
this
case
heard
here
in
this
court
to
get
--
to
--
to
get
it
reversed
so
they
could
get.
mr.
reeves
bowen
there
has
been
--
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
the
facts
at
all.
mr.
reeves
bowen
it
would
--
it
would
--
the
--
the
person
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
it
is
possible
that
the
--
that
the
hearing
would
so
develop.
he
might
be
able
to
produce
proof
that
it
would
show
that
and
he
would
--
should
not
be
said
under
that
law.
but
that
has
not
been
determined.
it's
--
it's
solely
on
the
face
of
the
papers
that
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
was
rendered.
mr.
reeves
bowen
our
supreme
court
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
and
that's
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
but
--
but
the
bail
that
--
that
mr.
cushman
had
in
mind
as
i
understood
it
was
to
put
him
on
bail
to
go
to
new
york,
not
temporary
bail
pending
a
hearing
in
the
florida
court.
but
given
with
--
now,
pennsylvania
for
example
has
got
a
statute
which
says
that
a
man
that
sought
to
be
extradited
can
make
bail
to
appear
there
unless
it's
a
capital
case
i
believe.
i
think
that
i
ran
across
that
--
that
statement
in
--
in
a
case
cited
by
mr.
cushman
in
re
allen.
mr.
reeves
bowen
no,
sir,
you
can't
when
it
comes
to
extradition.
mr.
reeves
bowen
for
crime
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
our
constitution
provides
that
--
that
he
is
entitled
to
bail
unless
he's
charged
with
a
capital
offense
in
serious
circumstances.
he
--
he
is
entitled
to
bail
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
sir
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
that
--
that's
what
we're
dealing
with.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
conviction
for
crime
at
all.
in
fact,
there's
no
crime
charged
against
mr.
o'neill,
first
or
last.
mr.
reeves
bowen
you
mean
to
the
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
pending
hearing
in
florida?
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
--
i
impliedly
conceded
to
that
without
--
by
never
raising
it
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
--
i
just
--
i
just
accepted
that
it
was
fitting
and
proper
and
it
was
in
the
court's
power
to
do
it.
where
he
felt
like
the
fellow
wouldn't
run
off
but
would
respond
to
the
bond,
and
his
faithful
justified
in
this
instance
because
he
did
respond,
and
to
hear
it,
until
he
was
discharged
by
order
of
the
court.
in
this
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
no,
he
was
ordered
to
go
back.
mr.
reeves
bowen
circuit
judge?
mr.
reeves
bowen
that
has,
to
my
knowledge,
been
nothing
put
before
the
florida
court
except
that
original
certificate
of
judge
fischer,
the
new
york
judge.
mr.
reeves
bowen
that
is
what
he
acted
on
and
--
and
among
other
things,
he
held
that
the
papers
on
their
face
didn't
show
that
mr.
o'neill
was
a
material
and
necessary
witness
but
supreme
court
of
florida
turned
him
down
on
that
and
said
that
was
--
and
they
said
they
did
show
on
its
face.
mr.
reeves
bowen
no
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
i
--
i
don't
recall
a
single
reference
to
the
constitution
of
florida
in
the
decision.
i
don't
think
there
is
any.
mr.
reeves
bowen
well,
perhaps
you
did
but
i
don't
recall
it.
it
may
--
it
may
have
been
a
reference
to
due
process.
it
may
have
been
section
maybe
12,
the
declaration
of
rights
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
afford
due
process.
but
--
but
they
didn't
place
their
decision
on
that.
they
placed
their
decision
squarely
upon
the
two
sources
of
the
federal
constitution.
in
spite
of
this,
mr.
cushman
continues
to
argue
that
the
sole
power
of
extradition
--
mr.
reeves
bowen
thank
you.
