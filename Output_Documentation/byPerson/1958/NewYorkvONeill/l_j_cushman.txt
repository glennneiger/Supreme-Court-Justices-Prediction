mr.
l.
j.
cushman
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
this,
i
consider
a
very
important
case.
in
fact,
i
suspect
it
is
a
case
important
to
the
practicing
lawyer,
much
more
so,
than
many
of
the
cases
which
reached
this
court.
i
want
to
call
your
attention
at
the
outset
to
the
fact
that
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
act
which
is
under
consideration
here.
first,
is
that
aspect
which
provides
that
the
judge
in
the
demanding
state
may
in
his
certificate
recommend
that
the
desired
witness
be
taken
into
immediate
custody
and
be
delivered
to
officers
of
the
demanding
state
to
be
returned
to
the
demanding
state,
as
a
witness
before
a
court
or
grand
jury
in
that
state.
the
second
aspect
is,
that
which
provides
for
the
issuance
of
a
witness
subpoena
in
florida,
let
us
say,
directing
the
witness
to
appear
as
a
witness
and
testify
before
a
court
or
grand
jury
while
he's
halfway
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
these
two
aspects
of
the
act
were
both
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
in
some
respects,
the
questions
which
i
think
control
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
on
the
first
aspect
of
the
case,
likewise
of
necessity
would
control
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
the
second
aspect
of
the
question.
i
should
like
to
discuss
both
aspects
briefly.
in
the
first
place,
we
are
in
this
country,
a
union
of
states.
the
federal
government
has
certain
powers
and
a
field
in
which
it
operates.
i
want
to
talk
to
you
now
about
the
constitutional
power
and
authority
of
the
states
to
adopt
a
law
providing
that
a
person,
a
citizen,
who
is
not
charged
or
suspected
with
having
committed
any
crime
in
any
state,
may
be
seized
unceremoniously
and
hauled
off
as
a
prisoner
to
a
distant
state.
does
that
constitutional
power
exist?
i
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
it
does
not.
in
the
first
place,
in
the
brief
which
i
filed
on
behalf
of
the
respondent,
i
have
reviewed
at
great
length,
perhaps
greater
length
than
the
circumstances
might
justify,
the
decisions
on
this
subject
of
interstate
rendition
of
fugitives
from
justice.
and
i
am
of
the
opinion,
and
it
was
my
conclusion
that
this
authority
from
every
corner,
from
every
court
have
always
held
that
the
power
of
one
state
to
surrender
to
a
sister
state
even
a
fugitive
from
justice,
is
derived
from
and
rest
solely
upon
section
2,
article
iv
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal-enabling
statutes
which
were
passed
to
implement
that
constitutional
provision.
and
it
is
my
argument,
it
is
my
contention,
that
if
he
required
that
constitutional
provision
and
those
federal
implementing
statutes
to
authorize
one
state
to
surrender
to
a
sister
state
a
fugitive
from
justice,
then
surely
a
like
authority
must
be
required
and
must
be
necessary
to
authorize
the
seizure
and
arrest
of
a
citizen
not
charged
with
any
crime
in
any
state
and
his
transportation
against
his
will
in
chains
perhaps
but
certainly
as
a
prisoner
to
a
distant
state,
merely
as
a
witness.
now,
mr.
--
the
attorney
general,
my
esteemed
friends
on
the
other
side
has
argued
to
you
all
about
the
difficulties
of
securing
witness.
i'm
aware
of
those
difficulties.
but
i
say
his
argument
proves
that
you
must.
i
suggest
to
you
that
no
such
power
exists.
that
is
the
power
to
seize
and
surrender
a
citizen
charged
with
no
offense
to
a
sister
state.
and
if
that
could
bring
--
his
argument
were
correct,
i
think
there's
a
much
more
direct
way
to
go
at
it.
there's
a
much
more
direct
way
to
reach
the
same
result.
if
it
can
be
so,
if
my
friend's
argument
is
valid,
if
the
police
for
example,
authority,
then
i'd
say
the
very
power
that
he
invoked
should
be
sufficient
to
authorize
the
state
of
florida
to
dispatch
enacting
that
the
courts
of
this
state
shall
have
complete
authority
to
issue
a
witness
subpoena,
to
turn
him
in,
in
the
courts
of
any
state
in
this
country
which
has
enacted
their
law
in
such
cases
providing
for
the
issuance
of
witness
subpoena
returnable
in
the
courts
of
any
other
states.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
would
be
less
than
frank
if
i've
said
that
your
question
has
not
given
me
considerable
concern
before
i
came
here.
but
my
answer
is
this,
and
i
think
this
is
the
answer.
that
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
florida,
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
florida,
and
in
securing
the
attendance
of
witnesses
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
florida,
it
may
be
that
the
legislature
of
florida
would
have
authority
to
pass
for
authorizing
the
attachment
of
a
witness,
authorizing
a
requirement
that
he
give
bond
for
a
period
in
that
state.
but,
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
is
no
different
than
the
question
we
have
here.
and
while
i'm
on
the
subject,
today
it
was
required
of
me
that
i
refer
to
three
cases
which
are
in
the
brief:
one
is
mclean
against
mississippi
in
95
f.2d,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
in
its
very
clear
language
held,
that
when
the
limits
of
a
state
are
reached,
the
official
character
of
its
officers
drop
from
their
shoulders
like
a
cloak.
they're
no
longer
officers.
in
(inaudible)
another
federal
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
the
court
held
that
when
a
sheriff
in
the
state
of
arizona
passes
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
state,
his
process
turns
to
ashes
in
his
hands
unless
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that
is
correct,
sir.
you've
asked
--
noted
your
honor's
point
on
that
a
little
earlier.
that
is
correct.
in
other
words,
its
power
to
act
as
an
officer
in
validity
of
the
process
exaggerates
a
distinct
line.
now,
there
is
the
difference
as
i
speak
of
it.
so
that,
in
my
opinion,
is
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
now,
as
i
was
about
to
say,
all
of
these
cases
hold
that
the
right,
the
authority,
the
power
of
the
state
to
surrender
one
citizen
to
a
sister
state
has
got
to
be
derived,
and
doesn't
derive,
solely
to
this
constitutional
provision.
in
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
in
an
opinion
of
which
i
have
the
honor
of
the
court,
said
that
if
it
were
not
for
section
2
article
iv
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
the
interstate
rendition
of
fugitive
from
justice.
and
i
think
we
are
right,
the
court
dispose
that
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
if
your
honor
please,
my
reading
of
the
authorities
gives
me
this
answer.
that
this
is
a
--
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
does
posses,
which
it
does
exercise
solely
upon
principles
of
political
expediency
i
probably
should
say.
and
in
people
against
hyatt
in
new
york
which
was
cited
in
my
--
in
my
brief,
the
court
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
no
such
power
exists
in
the
state
of
this
figure
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor.
it
sounds
plausible
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
authorities
hold
that
the
states
themselves
possess
no
power
as
between
themselves
to
surrender
a
citizen
who
is
in
one
state
to
another
unless
it
is
under
--
and
that's
section
2
of
article
iv
of
the
constitution
and
the
federal
statutes,
and
that
this
is
the
only
bridge
between
states
on
this
subject
of
surrendering
one
--
a
citizen
by
one
state
to
another.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
think
that
your
honor
may
be
correct
in
that
respect
and
here's
my
only
reply
to
you
if
i
may
give
it
to
you,
sir.
my
only
reply
to
you
is
this,
that
when
the
original
articles
of
confederation
were
adopted,
before
the
states
became
a
state,
before
their
fate
became
a
federal
union,
this
same
provision
in
substance
and
almost
word
for
word
was
in
the
articles
of
confederation.
and,
according
to
the
historic
reasoning
and
the
decisions
that
i've
read
it
is
indicated
that
the
men
who
were
in
charge
of
the
governmental
affairs
of
the
confederation
realized
that
without
a
compact
of
that
sort
in
the
articles
of
confederation
that
there
would
be
disposition
on
the
part
of
some
part
that
was
not
to
surrender,
disposition
of
another's
to
surrender
and
that
this
was
necessary
in
order
to
make
sure
that
these
things
were
done
and
to
promote
the
administration
of
justice
and
grant
them
in
the
courts
between
the
several
counties.
and
this
was
carried
forth
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
section
2
of
article
iv
and
hence,
the
authorities
indicate
to
mean
that
this
is
the
historical
background
for
the
proposition
that
the
authority
is
derived
from
the
federal
constitution
and
the
laws
and
acts
to
be
implemented.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
you
are
--
i
certainly
agree
with
you
on
that.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
oh,
most
certainly,
we
agree
wholeheartedly.
and
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
a
more
perfect
union
(inaudible)
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
in
my
judgment
was,
to
remove
from
the
states
any
power
to
surrender
citizens
from
one
state
to
another,
except
in
the
instances
provided
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now
then,
i
diverted
there
just
a
moment
but
the
first
point
i
want
to
make
before
i
leave
was
this.
that
this
power
to
surrender
fugitives
from
justice
is
a
power
which
is,
i
believe,
created
and
exists
by
virtue
of
section
2
article
iv
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
without
it,
there'd
be
no
such
thing,
any
similar
authority
is
necessary
if
citizens
are
not
charged
with
any
crime
and
that
fugitives
from
justice
are
to
be
surrendered
by
one
state
to
another.
now,
the
next
proposition
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
is,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
this,
states
to
pass
any
law
which
abridges
the
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
several
states.
now,
all
general
statements
are
dangerous
of
course.
this
is
one
of
those
statements
which
is
likewise
a
dangerous
statement,
i
realized.
however,
one
of
the
rights
of
national
citizenship
is
the
right
to
pass
freely
from
state
to
state
to
pass
to
--
both
are
interstate,
to
stay
there
as
long
as
you
want
to,
go
to
another
place
in
the
same
state,
and
to
depart
there
from.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
discussion
of
this
particular
proposition
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
--
these
very
little
to
be
desired.
now,
i
think
that
mr.
bowen
perhaps
has
an
idea
a
little
different
than
i
do.
as
i
understand
that
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
isn't
simply
a
matter
of
discrimination,
although
discrimination
exists
certainly,
discrimination
between
citizens
of
different
states
is
permitted.
but,
i
--
as
i
understand
it
and
from
my
reading
of
this,
it
comes
down
to
this,
that
the
rights
of
citizens
cannot
be
abridged
by
the
law
of
any
state.
now,
i
started
the
proposition
in
my
contentions
that
the
states
have
no
power
to
pass
such
a
law.
i
was
interested
in
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
by
one
of
your
honors,
about
what
would
happen
if
they're
going
through
a
state
that
didn't
have
this
law?
now,
let
me
talk
about
that
for
just
a
minute
because
i
think
it
illustrates
the
proposition.
georgia
doesn't
have
this
law.
but
let
us
suppose
that
alabama
did
have
the
law.
i
don't
know,
maybe
it
does.
i
think
it
does.
and
suppose
we
started
back
with
the
prisoner
in
a
car
going
to
new
york
and
they
had
him
in
handcuffs
because
they
knew
very
well
that
if
they
ever
turn
him
loose
he
would
be
--
disappears
in
a
hurry.
so
they
get
on
to
georgia
and
the
man
decide
if
he's
going
to
walk
away
from
them.
they
let
him
--
they
take
off
his
handcuffs
and
maybe
he
says,
"goodbye,
gentlemen,
i'm
going."
now,
they
have
no
valid
process
with
the
state
of
florida
because
that
is
halfway
the
state
line.
there
isn't
any
process.
they're
not
officers
of
the
state
of
new
york
because
under
the
rule
in
mclean
against
mississippi,
(inaudible)
and
these
other
cases,
as
soon
as
they
step
out,
have
gone
to
the
state
of
new
york,
they
no
longer
are
officers
of
the
law.
they
no
longer
have
the
authority
of
the
state
of
new
york.
that
has
evaporated
when
they
left
the
state
of
new
york.
so
they
are
only
private
citizens.
so
we
have
a
situation
in
which
private
citizens
are
undertaking
to
restrain
a
person
having
liberty,
having
in
their
possession
no
valid
process
of
any
kind.
what
does
it
come
down
to?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
but
i
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor
that
under
the
rule
in
pennoyer
against
neff
and
under
the
rule
in
every
case
of
which
i'm
acquainted
and
--
and
maybe
to
some
that
i'm
not
acquainted
with,
the
power
and
the
process
of
the
state
cannot
run
beyond
its
border.
and
when
the
--
when
the
process
reaches
the
borders
of
the
state
of
florida
as
processed,
it
has
evaporated.
it
ceases
to
exist
that
process,
and
it's
no
longer
effective
as
a
process.
that's
exactly
the
point.
that's
exactly
the
process.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
because
florida
couldn't
enforce
it
--
couldn't
enforce
any
action
under
it
beyond
the
limits
of
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstand
what
your
honor
was
talking
about.
here
is
my
understanding.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
this.
“is
it
when
this
--
this
process
can't
run
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
florida
so
that
if
the
officers
of
the
state
of
new
york
were
in
florida,
they're
not
officers
of
new
york
in
florida
at
all.”
they
have
no
statuses
also
in
florida
at
all.
they're
merely
private
citizens
acting
under
an
order
of
the
state
of
florida
which
isn't
--
at
least
be
effective
after
the
state
line
is
passed.
so
that
is
the
--
i
submit
to
you
they
have
no
authority
whatsoever.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
there
(voice
overlap)
--
now
that
point
was
made
abundantly
clear
in
mclean
against
mississippi.
and
the
court
said
this,
in
--
in
renditions
under
the
--
in
renditions
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
statute,
if
a
sheriff
is
sent
to
get
a
prisoner,
he
goes
to
that
foreign
state
not
as
a
sheriff
but
as
an
officer
designated
to
receive
custody
of
a
prisoner
who
is
held
under
the
process
which
obtained
his
validity
from
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
laws
so
that
by
virtue
of
that,
it
does
have
force,
it
does
have
effect
but
his
authority
is
not
as
a
sheriff
but
as
an
officer
under
that
process.
here's
what
they
said.
they
said
that
extradition
statute
18
u.s.c.
section
662
and
663
gives
state
sheriffs
no
duty
or
function.
the
governor
of
the
two
--
governors
of
the
two
states
handle
the
matter
and
the
prisoners
to
be
delivered
to
and
returned
by
a
specially
appointed
agent
and
not
by
the
state
sheriff
or
a
united
states
marshal.
even
though
one
who
is
a
sheriff
should
be
appointed
such
as
he
acts
not
as
sheriff
under
his
bounds,
but
as
special
agent
to
extradite
at
least
until
he
has
the
prisoner
in
his
custody
in
his
own
county.
when
in
this
case
mclean,
extradition
hasn't
been
waived
went
to
louisiana
and
took
charge
of
roy,
he
did
it
not
because
--
he
did
not
because
he
could
not
exert
the
office
sheriff
in
bolivar
county
mississippi,
in
louisiana,
and
again
in
tennessee
he
did
not
because
he
could
not
at
either
(inaudible).
he
has
neither
office
nor
color
of
office
as
a
mississippi
sheriff
while
in
another
state
where
mississippi
laws
were
not
enforced.
in
such
other
states,
he
is
only
a
private
citizen.
now,
that's
what
i
meant
when
i
said
the
official
character
of
a
sheriff
or
a
police
officer,
whatever
you
call
it,
evaporates
at
the
state
line.
but
he
is
no
longer
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
under
the
--
if
he
were
acting
under
process
in
connection
with
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
in
this
case
there
was
a
waiver
of
extradition.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
no
process.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
no,
not
if
he
were
--
not
if
he
were
acting
without
process.
under
this
decision,
he
would
not.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
as
i
read
this
decision
where
the
prisoner
waives
extradition,
then
the
officer
is
not
acting
under
the
extradition
laws
of
the
united
states
and
under
the
constitution
provision,
and
he
doesn't
enjoy
any
status
as
an
officer
in
the
state
in
which
he
has
gone.
now
that,
i
submit
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
unless
the
georgia
statutes
provided
for
the
arrest
of
one
who's
charged
and
suspected
with
a
crime
in
another
state
and
authorized
he
will
be
held
until
an
officer-in-duty
at
present
did
arise,
i
would
say
no,
no.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
sir?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
did
for
this
reason.
this
was
a
suit
by
mclean
upon
the
sheriff's
bound
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
beaten
up
while
he
was
in
custody
and
he
waived
extradition.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
sheriff
was
acting
under
the
color
of
his
office,
acting
under
his
bonds,
so
that
his
bonds
(inaudible).
and
the
court
said,
"no,
he
wasn't
acting
as
a
sheriff.
he
couldn't
be
acting
as
a
sheriff."
he
has
no
authority
to
act
as
the
sheriff.
now
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir
and
i
expect
he'd
had
to
be
discharged.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
orders,
judgments
and
decrees
in
the
state
of
florida
had
any
force
and
validity
in
effect
as
processed
in
the
state
of
georgia,
then
you
would
be
absolutely
correct.
but
the
answer
is
that
they
do
not
have
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
if
the
--
my
answer
to
your
honor
is
that
if
the
--
the
prejudgment
or
order
gave
a
state
court
in
--
in
florida,
had
any
validity
whatsoever
as
processed,
as
an
order,
as
a
judgment
effective
in
georgia,
then
i
say
there
might
be
--
i
respect
to
suggest
to
you,
there
might
be
merits
with
the
idea.
but
why
would
it
be
entitled
full
pays
in
credits
in
florida.
that
means
it
would
be
entitled
to
the
same
credit,
it
would
be
entitled
as
you
see
it
in
florida.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
it's
valid.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
as
far
as
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
for
the
same
reason,
i
submit
to
you,
that
process
issued
by
a
court
in
florida
would
be
invalid
and
ineffectual
to
require
a
person
to
appear
in
another
state
--
in
the
court
of
another
state
for
exactly
the
same
reason.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
sir?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
correct,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
right.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
[laughs]
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
correct
and
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
what
was
asked
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i'll
tell
you
why.
i
don't
think
that
that
question
is
necessarily
involved.
let
me
give
an
illustration.
if
an
order
of
the
court
or
process
of
the
court
in
dade
county
which
is
down
in
miami,
ordered
the
witness
to
appear
in
jacksonville
which
is
almost
at
the
other
end
of
the
state,
i
can
see
clearly
that
that
would
be
valid
enforceable
process.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
because
it's
within
the
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
--
boundaries
of
the
state.
yes,
sir.
but
i
say
that
if
that
same
process
instead
of
being
returnable
would
let
us
say,
to
the
circuit
court
of
--
to
the
circuit
court
in
duval
county
which
is
jacksonville
that
said,
that
it's
returnable
if
you
plead
at
highpoint,
north
carolina.
i
say
that
the
invalidity
of
the
process
isn't
a
question
of
whether
it's
valid
as
far
as
the
state
line
is
concerned.
i
say
it
isn't
valid
at
all
because
the
courts
of
the
state
of
florida
as
i
understand
have
no
power
to
issue
process
running
extraterritorial
--
extraterritorially
beyond
the
limits
of
the
state
of
florida
and
no
one
is
bound
to
obey.
now,
that
is
my
contention
on
that
proposition.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
punish
who
get?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
if
one
sheriff,
you
say?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
doubt
it.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
doubt
it
for
this
reason.
unless
the
officer
for
the
state
of
florida
was
acting
under
process
with
extradition
authorized
by
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
of
the
united
states,
the
officer
of
the
state
of
florida
would
have
no
more
authority
as
an
officer
in
the
state
of
georgia,
north
carolina
or
tennessee
than
any
other
person
from
any
other
state
would
have.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
he
might
be
from
florida
would
not
give
the
courts
of
florida
any
authority
to
say
to
him,
"you
were
because
of
our
judicial
or
other
by
it
require
to
act
as
an
officer
in
the
other
states
because
the
law
of
this
country
as
i
understand
it
says
that
the
state
of
florida
cannot
pass
an
act
which
has
extraterritorial
effect."
and
so
whether
the
officials
of
the
state
of
florida,
whoever
they
might
be,
whether
they
might
like
it
or
not,
they
would
be
helpless
in
face
of
the
proposition
announcement,
pennoyer
against
neff
that
the
laws
and
judicial
process
in
the
state
of
florida
does
run
beyond
the
limits
of
the
state
of
florida.
it
turns
into
ashes
at
the
state
line.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
think
if
i
may
make
a
suggestion
to
your
honor
the
--
the
principle
that
you're
alluding
to,
in
my
judgement,
is
quite
different.
let
me
illustrate
it.
suppose
a
court
sitting
in
florida
had
a
case
before
it
in
which
the
disposition
of
property
in
california
is
involved.
the
court
in
florida
may
say
to
the
defendant,
“we
enjoin
and
restrain
you
for
making
any
conveyances
of
properties
in
california.”
and
the
defendant
may
say,
“if
your
honor
please,
i
deny
your
jurisdiction
to
make
such
an
order.
i
shall
convey
it,
nevertheless.”
and
therefore,
and
if
he
does
so,
and
the
court
says,
“my
friends,
we
had
you
before
the
court.
you
are
in
the
jurisdiction.
you
are
subject
to
our
orders
and
you
will
be
found
in
contempt."
now,
this
very
subject
that
your
honor
has
alluded
to,
i
suggest
to
you,
is
not
entirely
free
from
difficulties.
i
don't
believe
that
the
courts
are
unanimous
in
expressing
the
view
that
i
have
just
expressed
to
you.
i'm
merely
expressing
to
you
what
i
think
is
perhaps
the
proper
view.
but
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
the
respondent,
the
defendant
is
present
in
the
court
which
proposes
to
impose
the
sanction
and
it
has
the
authority
then
to
require
your
views
of
things
and
he
is
there
to
enforce
it.
the
same
thing
comes
up
frequently
in
florida
when
the
courts
down
there
say
to
a
man,
“we
enjoin
you
from
prosecuting
your
suit
for
divorce
against
your
wife
any
further
up
in
new
york,
for
example
or
in
some
other
states.”
but
this
proposition
that
i
suggest
to
your
honors
were
not
free
from
a
difference
of
opinion.
i
think
the
court
in
florida
has
the
authority
as
long
as
a
defendant
is
there
to
make
an
order
in
personam,
but
if
that
defendant
was
not
in
florida,
if
he
were
going
to
defend
this
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
--
as
well,
the
respond
to
anyone
who
would
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
sir?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
but
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
in
florida
has
any
authority
to
order
a
witness
in
--
to
go
to
some
other
states.
i
think
that
this
took
first
--
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
exercise
of
the
court's
power
to
enforce
by
enforcing
its
power
of
a
judgment
in
rem
or
a
proceeding
in
rem
like
an
injunction,
the
performance
of
an
act
in
another
state
because
they've
got
jurisdiction
and
possession
of
the
respondent.
and
to
make
him
do
it,
we'll
put
him
in
jail
if
he
doesn't
do
it.
now,
that's
the
only
--
and
i
think
that's
vast,
the
difference
from
ordering
him
to
go
to
another
state.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
if
the
witness
is
in
the
custody
of
an
officer?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
in
my
--
in
--
in
one
of
the
decisions,
not
after
borders
of
the
state
of
florida
had
tackled.
no,
sir.
and
i
rely
upon
the
decisions
that
i
have
referred
to
and
on
other
decisions
which
were
cited
in
the
brief,
one
of
which
is
(inaudible).
may
i
tell
you
about
that
case?
in
that
case
a
man
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
was
charged
with
an
offense
which
has
been
committed
in
the
district
of
columbia,
right
here
in
washington.
the
marshal,
or
whoever
he
is,
in
the
district
of
columbia
sent
the
sheriff
by
the
name
of
chase
(ph)
down
in
dade
county
a
warrant
and
said
pick
up
so
and
so,
pick
up
(inaudible).
we
got
a
warrant
for
him.
and
so
they
picked
up
(inaudible)
down
in
florida
and
passed
it
and
filed
a
habeas
corpus
and
contended
that
they
had
no
authority
to
seize
him
whatsoever.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
discharging
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
says
that
is
correct.
if
the
warrant
from
the
district
of
columbia
had
been
there,
it
wouldn't
have
been
effective
in
florida
because
it
has
no
extraterritorial
effect.
and
unless
it
is
under
the
extradition
statutes,
it
would
have
no
legal
validity
and
no
legal
standing.
now,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
view
of
the
case
dealing
with
this
subject,
will
reveal
that
that
is
the
situation
so
far
as
the
cases
are
concerned
throughout
this
country.
now,
it
may
be
that
there
--
it
maybe
that
it's
necessary
to
make
a
change
on
that.
i
don't
know.
i'm
almost
persuaded
from
my
learned
friend
on
the
other
side
that
it
is.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
can't
be
made
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution
by
such
a
law
as
we
have
here,
which
is
under
consideration
here.
now
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
sir?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
there
is
a
statute,
a
federal
statute,
right
now
that
aims
in
that
same
direction.
that's
section
1073,
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
which
makes
it
a
penal
offense
to
depart
from
the
jurisdiction
to
avoid
testifying
as
a
witness.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
section
1073,
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
true.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
true
but
it
has,
of
course,
its
effect
but
certainly
that
is
nothing.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
oh,
it
wouldn't
work
here.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
no,
it
wouldn't
work
here.
no.
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
and
in
my
judgment,
it
would
have
to
be
--
it
would
have
to
be
pursuant
to
some
constitutional
authority.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
unless
article
--
unless
section
2
article
iv
of
the
constitution
would
authorize
it,
then
that
there
is
none.
now,
let
me
explain.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
sir?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
only
with
fugitives.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
when
you
run
to
town
under
the
commerce
clause?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
as
it's
bearing
on
the
subject
that
runs
with
it.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
frankly
confess
that
i
am
not
enough
of
a
constitutional
lawyer
to
answer
that
question.
i
wish
i
could.
i
just
don't
know
it.
but
i
would
say
this,
taking
innes
against
tobin,
which
is
one
of
the
favorite
cases
of
my
esteemed
contemporary,
all
of
these
cases
that
he
has
cited
and
all
of
these
laws
that
he
has
referred
to
have
one
thing
in
common.
all
of
them
are
in
aid
of
interstate
rendition
of
fugitives
from
justice,
all
of
them.
even
the
uniform
act
dealing
with
deserters
who
desert
their
families
because
in
florida
and
many
states,
it
is
a
felony
to
desert
a
person,
wife
or
children,
and
so
even
that
is
in
aid
of
the
federal
power.
it
may
be
that
a
statute
which
would
authorize
the
interstate
institution
of
witnesses,
passed
by
congress,
would
be
likewise
held
to
be
in
aid
of
the
power
to
extradite
fugitives
from
justice.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
frankly,
i
do
too,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
if
it
doesn't
--
if
that
isn't
the
solution,
then
i
don't
think
there
is
any
constitutional
solution
short
of
the
amendment
to
the
section
2
of
article
iv
to
provide
for
the
interstate
extradition
witness.
i'm
frank
to
say
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
have
trouble
with
it
too.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
isn't
that
the
one
where
he
was
brought
from
another
country?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
do
not
consider
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
case
that
we
have
before
the
court
today.
well
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
because
that
i
think
that
the
power
of
the
states
is
quite
different
than
the
power
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
your
honor
certainly
makes
a
convincing
presentation
of
the
subject.
i
could
not
deny
that.
i
merely
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
states
of
the
union
don't
possess
that
power,
and
while
your
honor's
argument
--
i
don't
feel
that
i
should
surrender
the
point,
if
i
may.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
the
record
shows
that
mr.
o'neill
was
a
resident
and
citizen
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
and
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
that
because
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
it.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
the
record
doesn't
show
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
he
was
ever
in
new
york
or
whether
he
was
in
new
york
a
week
before
the
district
attorney
started
the
proceedings
in
new
york.
it
merely
says
that
they
had
tried
without
success
to
get
him
to
appear
as
a
witness.
now,
it
isn't
stated
that
they
ever
had
a
witness
subpoena
issued
for
him
in
new
york
and
tried
to
serve
him
but
couldn't
serve
him.
we
never
--
it
isn't
stated
that
they
had
a
witness
subpoena
served.
if
they
did
issued
and
if
it
did
serve
it
and
he
refused
to
respond
to
it
or
anything
of
the
sort.
it
doesn't
even
say
that
they
ever
personally
asked
him
to
come
and
that
he
directly
refused.
they
simply
say
they
haven't
been
able
to
get
him
there.
now,
that's
all
there
is
in
the
record
on
the
subject.
does
that
answer
your
honor's
question?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
material
in
this
respect
if
i
may.
i
think
it's
material
because
this
application
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
from
this
proceeding
was
originally
begun,
didn't
contain
any
kind
of
facts
which
would
support
any
sort
of
a
seizure
of
a
person.
now,
i
contend
--
it
is
my
contention
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
issuance
of
process
of
a
drastic
nature
such
as
the
seizure
of
a
person,
that
there
should
be
facts
stated
to
support
the
application.
just
like
if
you
go
to
apply
for
an
injunction,
you've
got
to
state
the
facts
upon
which
to
show
the
necessity
for
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
and
if
it's
necessary
to
state
facts
in
order
to
support
an
application
for
an
injunction,
certainly,
it
ought
to
be
necessary
to
state
facts
to
authorize
an
application
for
the
seizure
of
a
person
in
a
distant
state
and
transportation
back,
if
you
please,
as
a
prisoner.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
rightly
or
wrongly,
the
learned
circuit
judge
said
that
he
did
not
consider
that
any
testimony
was
--
could
be
offered
on
the
subject.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
and
it
had
to
be
decided
on
the
face
of
the
application.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
want
to
present
some
testimony
but
he
wouldn't
hear
anything,
and
the
district
attorney
from
new
york
wanted
to
make
some
statements
about
what
was
said
to
the
judge
at
the
time
the
application
was
made
in
new
york
state
and
the
circuit
judge
in
florida
refused
likewise
to
hear
that.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
under
the
decision
as
it
now
stands,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
thing
that
the
court
would
be
willing
to
hear
me
on
would
be
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
some
peculiar
reason
which
would
make
any
hardship
on
o'neill
to
go
to
new
york
state.
that's,
as
a
witness,
and
that's
about
the
only
thing
i
believe
the
court
would
entertain
any
kind
of
a
hearing
on.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
what
it
provides.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
but
to
be
frank
with,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
we
would
contend,
for
example,
whether
he
would
served
his
due
process
in
new
york
or
in
any
state
to
which
he
might
go,
does
appear
to
me
that
he
--
largely
a
question
of
law
than
it
is
a
question
of
facts.
and
the
only
other
question
that
it
would
appear
to
me,
it
would
be
open
for
a
consideration
and
discussion
could
be
where
it
would
constitute
a
hardship
for
him
to
go
to
new
york.
and
i
suggest
that
to
go
to
new
york
as
a
prisoner
in
custody
of
an
officer
and
my
examinations
in
new
york
decisions
indicate
that
in
this
lack
of
investigation,
the
practice
has
been
almost
uniform
for
a
bond
around
$200,000
or
the
--
the
witness
be
in
jail.
now,
in
my
brief
filed
with
the
supreme
of
court
of
florida,
i
had
adverted
to
that
subject.
and
of
course
i
can
very
well
see
how
he
might
get
to
new
york
when
we
say,
"well,
mr.
o'neill,
we'll
be
glad
to
issue
a
bond
higher
while
you're
here,
if
you
want
to
post
a
bond,
say
$200,000
that
mr.
o'neill
couldn't
post
a
bond
of
$200,000,
they'd
say
well
to
the
two
with
it,
and
when
we
get
ready
for
him
as
a
witness,
we'll
call
him
as
a
witness
if
you
know
right
where
he
is.
that's
the
situation
(inaudible).
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
to
be
frank
about
it,
i
can
only
say
this.
the
order
of
the
circuit
judge
which
was
to
discharge
him,
discharge
him
and
ensure
he's
on
a
bond.
now,
it
may
well
be,
it
may
well
be
that
if
this
court
should
reverse
its
decision
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
so
by
operation
of
law
reverse
the
decision
of
the
circuit
judges
that
he
would
be
held,
in
all
likelihood,
that
the
discharge
of
the
bonds
would
be
in
effect
with
and
the
bonds
wouldn't
be
required
to
produce,
mr.
o'neill
before
the
judge
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
i'm
in
agreement
with
you,
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
that's
something
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
mr.
justice
whittaker,
you
have
touched
the
point
which
i
considered
and
the
reason
i
did
not
argue
that
point
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
i
might
have
argued.
i
thought,
at
least
i
considered
arguing
whether
--
since
o'neill
is
back
in
illinois
and
the
bond
has
been
discharged
whether
it
would
be
a
moot
question
or
not.
but
i
didn't
argue
it
because
i
didn't
think
that
it
was
an
argument
that
i
should
make.
and
it's
not
too
much
of
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
o'neill
would
defy
the
law
or
the
lies
his
attorney
would
advise
him
to
and
i
didn't
make
the
argument.
and
i
can
only
give
you
the
same
answer
here.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
think
you're
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
frankly,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
if
the
bond
is
not
gone.
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
the
bonds
would
simply
lose
the
forfeiture
and
that's
that.
he
still
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
it
because
there
would
still
be
no
basis
for
forcing
him
to
return.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
correct.
and
of
course
if
the
bond
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
sir?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
that
is
correct.
that's
right.
and
so
if
the
bonds
couldn't
induce
him
to
return
to
florida,
it
might
be
that
the
bond
--
this
feature
of
the
bond
would
be
the
only
remedy
left.
now,
there's
no
use
to
dissemble
on
that
point.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
frankly,
i
doubt
it,
mr.
justice
black.
but
i
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
no,
sir.
he's
not.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
he
could
not
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
no,
you
couldn't
have
indicted
him.
no,
sir.
no
way
to
indict.
if
your
honors
please,
i
thank
you
for
your
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
my
understanding
is
that
it
is
not
in
session.
now,
whether
the
state
of
new
york
really
wants
o'neill
at
this
time,
i
cannot
tell
you.
i
did
write
to
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
and
asked
him
if
he
was
any
longer
interested
in
mr.
o'neill.
he
wrote
me
back
and
said
in
substance
or
effect
that
they
are
always
interested
in
mr.
o'neill.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
he
did
not
but
i
knew
that
it
had
been
discharged
because
it
was
in
november
grand
jury
and
it
had
continued
over
until
spring
of
the
following
year,
and
i
knew
that
it
was
discharged.
but
of
course
i
suppose
that
he
intended
to
inform
me
that
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
--
another
grand
jury
might
like
to
see
him
anyway.
so
that
is
that.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
only
decision
that
has
ever
reached
the
courts
and
certainly
this
is
the
only
decision
on
this
subject
which
has
ever
reached
the
court
of
last
resort
of
any
state.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
yes,
sir.
and
in
the
record,
you
will
find
as
an
appendix
to
the
opinion
of
the
nisi
prius
judge
and
listed
the
13
or
14
cases
in
which
this
act
has
been
construed
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
am
sure
there
have
been
but
i
don't
know
about
it.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
expect
that
it
is.
yes,
sir.
i
don't
doubt
it.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
(inaudible).
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well,
in
re
stamer,
i
believe,
was
one
of
those
cases.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
at
any
rate,
if
your
honors
please,
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
statute
which
has
had
considerable
use
and
perhaps
it
has
some
value.
but
i
say,
nevertheless,
that
there
are
not
many
who
might
be
called
as
witnesses,
who
would
have
the
means
to
make
the
defense
which
mr.
o'neill
has
made
in
this
case.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
may
be
many
who
have
suffered
the
rigors
of
this
statute
without
being
able
to
complain
effectively
about
it.
if
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
that's
all
right,
as
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
--
many
as
you
like.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
well
--
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
i
can
indeed.
when
mr.
o'neill
came
to
florida
to
preside
at
a
meeting
of
the
international
union,
he
was
seized
on
an
attachment,
a
body
attachment.
he
was
taken
immediately
before
the
circuit
judge.
the
circuit
judge
ordered
him
released
upon
giving
a
bond,
condition
that
he
would
appear
at
any
subsequent
hearing
in
the
proceedings
and
stand
to
and
abide
by
any
order
that
the
court
made
in
the
premise.
when
the
time
came,
he
being
at
liberty
on
the
bond,
i
filed
a
response
and
motion,
to
quash
the
attachment
and
the
rule
to
show
cause.
and
the
court,
in
an
opinion
and
ordered,
granted
my
motion
and
discharged
the
rule
to
show
cause
and
the
attachment
and
discharged
the
bond
and
discharged
o'neill
and
his
sureties
on
that
bond.
now,
then,
i
suspect,
and
i
will
state
that
it
is
my
opinion,
based
on
those
facts,
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
is
reversed,
it
would
necessarily
reverse
also
the
order
discharging
the
bond
so
that
the
bond
would
still
be
in
effect.
yes,
sir?
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
to
the
extent
that
the
bond
is
involved?
no,
sir.
as
far
as
actually
getting
o'neill
back
to
florida,
it
might
well
be
considered
moot.
mr.
l.
j.
cushman
the
bond
is
made
payable
to
--
as
i
can
recall
it
to
the
governor
of
the
state
of
florida
and
his
successors
in
office.
it's
an
ordinary
bail
bond.
and
a
suit
would
have
to
be
maintained
by
the
state
for
the
benefit
of
the
fine
and
forfeiture
fund
is
my
opinion.
it
isn't
anything
that
would
operate
to
the
financial
benefit
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
new
york,
however
much
that
might
be
desired.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
