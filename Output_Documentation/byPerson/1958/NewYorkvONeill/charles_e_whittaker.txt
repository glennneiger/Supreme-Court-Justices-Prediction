does
ingress

egress
mean
of
whom
leave
you
now
to
the
supreme

florida?
justice
charles

whittaker
and
made,
that
was
under
your
law
the
(inaudible)
may
be
incarcerated
as
a
material
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
act
is
reciprocal
as
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
the
uniform
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
many
states
are
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
not
localized.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
even
going
next
door.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
doesn't
mr.
justice
brennan's
suggestion
require
that
both
taken
in
credit.
surely,
you
couldn't
see
the
law
that
in
order
for
a
state
to
obtain
a
person
from
another
state
that
every
state
through
which
the
docket
might
pass
would
sustain
the
extradition
or
the
procurement
of
the
person?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that's
on
principles.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
see
any
invalidity
in
a
statute
in
florida
which
was
provided,
without
saying
or
might
incarcerate
a
witness,
proximately
about
construing
(inaudible)
and
it
was
material
to
an
action
pending
in
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
including
the
ancillary
of
a
reservation,
or
federal
ancillary.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
not
but
one
thing
to
recognize
the
principles
of
pennoyer
versus
neff.
and
frankly,
nothing
to
recognize
that
an
order
in
proceedings
in
personam
may
be
entered
by
a
court
requiring
action
beyond
its
borders
by
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you,
i
don't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
and
could
be
a
witness.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
could
be
a
witness
as
in
this
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
is
not
with
the
custody
of
such
a
witness
when
by
order
of
the
court,
it
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
an
agent,
sheriff
or
whatnot.
is
not
that
custody
from
beginning
to
the
end
term
court
custody?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
the
--
of
the
miami
court.
this
is
what
--
this
is
turned
over
to
this
custodian
who
is
directed
by
the
court's
order
to
take
him
to
new
york.
is
not
the
custody
throughout
the
district
court's
custody?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
sir.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
mr.
o'neill
still
under
bond
to
the
dade
county
court
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
have
the
effect
of
vacating
the
order
of
the
circuit
judge
dismissing
the
bond?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
didn't
intend
to
indicate.
i'm
just
asking.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
that's
true,
do
we
have
--
if
the
bond
has
been
discharged,
do
we
have
only
a
moot
case
here
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
assure
you,
this
is
my
last
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
but
there
is,
maybe,
some
misunderstanding
as
to
your
answer
to
my
question
that
followed.
the
bond,
under
which
mr.
o'neill
was
released
by
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county,
is
or
is
not
yet
effective?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
you
give
us
the
facts
and
your
conclusion
briefly?
