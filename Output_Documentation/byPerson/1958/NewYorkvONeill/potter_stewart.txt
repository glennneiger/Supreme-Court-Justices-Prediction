justice

mr.
bowen,
that
--
actually,
this
--
this
statute
applies
only
to
benefit
the
prosecution
in
a
criminal
case,
doesn't
it?
is
it
available
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
witnesses
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
defendant
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
i
gather
that
is
your
interpretation
of
the
florida
--
justice
potter
stewart
variation.
but
this
has
not
been
decided
by
the
courts.
i
--
i
remember
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
the
statute
as
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
your
brief
on
page
30,
942.02
section
2
provides
that
--
provides
for
a
hearing
in
florida,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
for
a
determination
after
a
hearing
that
the
witness
is
material
and
necessary
that
it
will
not
cause
undue
hardship
to
the
witness
to
be
compelled
to
attend
and
testify
and
also
that
he
will
be
immune
from
service
while
he's
there.
is
that
the
price?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
you
of
course
never
had
a
hearing
in
this
case
because
the
circuit
judge
decided
you
will
ride
on
your
constitutional
claim
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
if
--
if
perchance
this
court
should
disagree
with
that,
then
you
go
back
and
have
the
right
to
this
kind
of
a
hearing,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bowen,
i
have
another
question.
it's
been
covered,
i've
missed
it.
it
suggested
in
the
briefs
that
another
infirmity
of
this
legislation
may
be
that
it
does
not
provide
for
release
on
bail
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
know
in
this
case
the
man
was
released
and
that
may
be
the
answer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
that's
their
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
that
the
statute
does
provide
for
enlargement
on
bail?
justice
potter
stewart
pending
a
hearing,
say
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
that's
the
short
answer
that
it's
not
therefore
before
us.
