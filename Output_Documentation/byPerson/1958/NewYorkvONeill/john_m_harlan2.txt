justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
was
there
a
subpoena
served
on
mr.
o'neill
as
well.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
courts
passed
--
your
--
your
supreme
court
passed,
did
it
not,
on
both
aspects
of
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
yes.
although
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
there
was
no
subpoena
involved
in
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
--
does
this
mean
on
the
theory
that
your
court
decided
it
that
if
florida
itself
has
arrested
one
of
its
citizens
in
relation
to
being
a
witness
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
a
florida
proceeding,
would
that
that
kind
of
a
statute
be
unconstitutional?
because
that's
certainly
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
state,
and
the
period
demand
ingress
and
egress
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
arrest
them
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
this
--
in
this
instance
mr.
bowen,
the
state
of
new
york
came
in
and
asked
for
a
habeas
or
an
arrest.
justice
john
m.
harlan
taking
into
custody.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
--
what
i
was
going
to
--
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
of
this
is
the
--
the
state
that
wants
rendition
wants
the
witness
and
comes
in
and
says,
“i
--
we
want
just
to
arrest
him.”
does
your
local
judge,
under
your
local
court
under
the
act,
not
withstanding,
and
have
authority
to
say,
"no,
i
don't
permit
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
his
arrest
but
you
can
subpoena
him.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
be
--
supposing
on
his
trip
back
from
florida
to
new
york,
he
passes
through
an
immediate
state
particularly
one
that
has
no
--
hasn't
a
uniform
act
of
this
kind.
what
authority
does
the
officer
got
to
hold
him
in
custody
in
that
state?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
--
what
about
the
situation
where
he's
passing
through
a
state
which
there's
not
been
such
a
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
the
one
answer
to
my
own
question
might
be
that
whatever
the
situation
as
regards
the
intermediate
state,
that
ought
not
to
serve
judicially
of
the
act
of
florida
that
has
taken
him
into
custody
which
is
all
that's
involved
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
does
that
--
how
does
that
affect
the
validity
of
florida's
order
in
the
first
instance
which
is
always
up
before
us
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
haven't
got
that
situation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then
from
here,
florida
would
have
the
right
to
consent
a
--
a
prisoner
to
a
demanding
state
through
one
of
its
own
officers
and
then
if
he
let
the
man
go,
escape
in
an
intervening
state,
florida
could
certainly
punish
that
prisoner
when
the
sheriff
will
get
hold
of
him,
couldn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
their
own
sheriffs.
if
they
will
only
return
him
over.
justice
john
m.
harlan
certainly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
a
doubt
(voice
overlap)
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
don't
consider
this
case
moot?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
amount
of
the
bond?
justice
john
m.
harlan
$2500.
