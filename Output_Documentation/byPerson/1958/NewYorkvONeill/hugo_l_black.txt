justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
man
ensue
--
got
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
georgia,
this
particular
man,
when
he
got
up
there
they
had
a
law
which
prevent
him
from
bringing
the
man
through
the
state
to
serve
as
a
witness
sometime,
then
you'd
have
your
question
raised
for
the
accuser,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
--
what
you're
saying
is
i
presume
that
the
full
paid
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
get
back
to
your
original
question,
full
pays
and
credits,
though
it
only
requires
obedience
by
one
state
for
another's
valid
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
this
is
not
valid
insofar
that
directs
the
man
be
taken
beyond
the
state
of
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
georgia
cannot
be
bound
by
it
for
that
reason.
you're
arguing
it's
just
the
same
i
suppose
as
though
the
man
at
florida
had
ordered
him
sent
to
china.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
started
to
--
unite
to
georgia.
that's
--
might
send
him
to
georgia
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
through
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
you'd
say
that
that
was
not
a
valid
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
--
does
that
not
indicate
that
we
may
have
before
us,
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
questioned
you
about
--
the
problem
which
he
questioned
you
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
determine
now
whether
this
is
a
valid
order
all
the
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
not,
how
could
a
man
ever
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
â€“
you're
invoking
the
doctrine
of
pennoyer
and
neff
or
the
cases
that
say
that
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction
to
do
something
beyond
its
boundaries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
if
--
i
--
i
don't
mean
you're
right
but
if
there's
any
law
at
all
passed
that
it
have
to
by
the
federal
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
where
this
man
lived?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
anything
about
his
being
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
does
the
record
show
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
material
if
you
were
a
fugitive
from
justice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
record
show
about
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
it's
probably
not
material
to
the
narrow
contrast
of
the
points
you
are
raising.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
suppose,
i
--
i'm
just
asking,
because
i
don't
know.
suppose
you
lose
this
case
here
on
the
judgment
as
it
is,
do
you
mean
that
he
would
be
cut-off
from
going
into
the
courts
of
florida
to
show,
for
instance,
if
he
could,
that
he
has
never
been
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
--
would
there
be
anything
left
to
try
or
would
--
is
it
--
would
it
--
on
--
on
your
viewpoint,
would
it
mean
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
give
notice
from
one
state
once
a
man
is
a
witness
and
he
has
to
go,
just
on
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
an
offer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
an
offer
made
to
present
a
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
consider
this
--
that
would
be
foreclosed
if
the
--
if
the
court
should
decide
against
you
and
hold
that
the
law
is
balanced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
way
they
can
get
it
back
from
new
york
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
still
remains
that
he's
not
in
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
still
remains
that
he's
not
in
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
--
what
about
the
grand
jury,
the
new
york
grand
jury?
do
you
know
whether
it's
still
in
session?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
about
the
grand
jury
was
given
session
that
there's
something
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
as
a
former
state
trial
judge
is
in
my
state
if
there's
some
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
many
orders
under
this
--
this
kind
of
statute.
it
was
very
wrong
without
ever
having
anyone
suggest
that
you
successfully
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
came
after
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
the
grand
jury
(inaudible)
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
but
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
originally
have
a
case,
isn't
it?
that
question
came
up
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
means
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
no
subpoena
has
been
issued.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
florida
directly
involve
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
--
what
was
the
basis
on
which
it
asked
that
he'd
be
sent
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
can
see
it
on
the
basis
(inaudible)
the
witness
before
the
said
grand
jury
be
required
to
appear
15
days.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
judgment
would
be
just
to
go
ahead
on
this
same
case
or
some
other
grand
juries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
order
--
was
the
order
issued
to
him
to
go
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
based
solely
on
the
order
of
judge
--
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
the
judge
in
new
york
as
shown
by
the
order
that
he
was
just
here
before
november
grand
jury
of
that
year.
is
that
the
only
basis
on
which
the
order
rests
and
on
which
the
controversy
with
him
as
to
going
back
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
judge
holt
acted
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did
not
test
below
under
his
own
constitution,
did
it,
but
reserved
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
reserved
that
for
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
thought
i
read
one
a
moment
ago.
maybe,
i
didn't.
