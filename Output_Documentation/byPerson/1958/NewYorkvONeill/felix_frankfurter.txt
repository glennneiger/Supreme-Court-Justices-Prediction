would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
exactly
what
happened
in
the
case
before
us
from
the
beginning
of
the
process
or
procedures
to
the
culmination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
reason
given?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
reason
given
why
he
was
needed
for
15
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
specified
that
his
presence
in
new
york
was
required
for
15
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
--
that
he
was
to
be
made
available
for
a
period
of
15
days
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
investigation
which
you
spoke.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
a
--
at
a
proceeding
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
of
the
court
judges
with
--
with
--
and
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
the
basis
of
the
new
york
document,
your
judge
in
dade
county
issued
what
in
effect
was
a
warrant
of
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
subpoenas
belong
into
your
courts
in
the
northern
part
of
florida
run
to
the
extreme
south?
justice
felix
frankfurter
run
throughout
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anybody
can
be
hauled
up
from
the
tip
to
the
--
to
the
border.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
any
--
have
you
a
provision
in
your
laws
of
in
general
like
the
--
or
with
the
statute
in
the
federal
law
so
that
the
persons,
the
writ
of
ne
exeat
which
is
ancient
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
as
ancient
as
the
common
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
that
in
florida.
justice
felix
frankfurter
specifically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
can
prevent
a
fellow
from
taking
a
comfortable
trip
to
france
or
the
riviera
or
the
--
or
la
antigua
or
anywhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
a
fellow
is
indicted
for
a
serious
crime
in
europe
and
the
attorney
general's
office
or
whoever
prosecutes
in
florida
has
noticed
that
he
will
take
a
plane
tomorrow?
have
you
politicians
to
ask
for
a
writ
of
ne
exeat?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
on
the
constitutional
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
renditions,
state
--
interstate
rendition.
suppose
illinois
and
california
asked
your
governor
to
surrender
a
fugitive
from
justice
in
illinois
and
california.
have
you
a
machinery
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
cross
the
border,
choose
to
cross
the
border.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
--
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
question
however
is
being
--
that
kind
of
legislation
is
also
being
called
into
question
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
not
yet
adjudicated
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
--
what
do
you
say
of
the
compact,
mr.
bowen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that,
there
have
been,
had
there
not,
compacts
between
states
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
subpoenas
and
so
on.
the
border
states
for
instance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
--
yes
or
where
the
river
divides
two
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
are
such
compacts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
they
ought
to
get
forty
odd
states
to
agree
to
a
compact.
it's
a
--
quite
a
little
job,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
to
this
uniform
statute,
mr.
bowen,
had
that
been
adopted
in
precise
terms
in
its
identity
in
all
the
forty-two
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
this
very
statute.
i
know
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
of
course
if
you
have
minor
variations
in
the
statute,
you
begin
to
get
variations
in
court
decisions
and
all
the
consequences
of
such
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
know
about
this
statute.
i
don't
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
putting
--
putting
the
question
of
constitutionality
to
one
side
from
the
point
of
view
of
--
forgive
me
--
of
achieving
the
purpose
in
pertaining
the
objective
of
this
uniform
legislation,
the
power
of
arrest
is
almost
essential
for
the
mechanics
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
--
in
this
case
on
what
you've
just
told
me,
i
didn't
know.
if
he'd
remained
in
his
home
state,
that
would
be
a
permanent
asylum
for
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
defendant,
that
in
the
case
of
--
of
a
defendant
--
of
defendant's
liability
that
follows
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
source
of
the
power
of
the
federal
government
without
a
treaty
to
see
fit?
may
it
--
may
it
--
may
the
federal
government
surrender
a
fugitive
from
a
foreign
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
because
that
involve
a
relation
with
foreign
nation
and
that's
outside
of
the
scope
of
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
relation
of
state
to
state
is
within
the
framework
of
the
union
and
not
outside
and
not
an
aptitude
of
power
--
of
sovereignty
vis-à-vis
the
rest
of
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
put
it
to
you
but
that
question
could
not
have
been
decided
by
this
court
because
there
is
a
provision
in
the
federal
constitution
so
we
don't
know
what
the
part
of
a
statement
of
--
in
vis-à-vis
the
other
states
if
there
had
not
been
the
federal
--
of
constitutional
privileges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
to
(inaudible)
within
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
prior
to
the
constitution
the
states
really
were
self-contained
separate
properties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
confederation
is
--
is
a
very
different
thing
from
the
union
of
--
a
more
perfect
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
agree
on
that,
can't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cushman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
blackmer
against
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
an
american
citizen
living
in
paris
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
refused
to
heed
a
subpoena
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
one
of
the
courts
to
the
district
or
in
new
york.
now,
what
bearing
do
you
think
if
any,
does
in
that
case
has
upon
this
situation,
except
that
there
we
were
dealing
with
the
--
there,
the
legislation,
we're
dealing
with
an
american
citizen.
but
there
was
a
person
who
was
living
in
paris
insofar
as
a
mean
--
physical
means
of
hauling
him
out
of
paris,
they
were
beyond
the
power
of
this
country,
of
this
government
to
recall
just
as
a
sheriff
you
say,
his
power
will
evaporate
as
soon
he
reaches
the
border
of
florida,
so
the
power
of
any
american
official
evaporates
except
by
--
by
leave
of
the
foreign
country.
it
has
no
power
that
this
country
can
give
him
and
yet
this
court
sustained
a
statute
which
said,
"if
he
doesn't
turn
up,
he
shall
be
found
in
absentia,
guilty
of
contempt
subject
to
a
fine
of
$100,000
and
the
forfeiture
and
the
seizure
of
his
property
to
--
to
pay,
to
liquidate
that
$100,000.
now,
i've
--
i've
indicated
that's
with
a
citizen.
and
therefore,
if
we
have
the
case
of
a
floridian
citizen
or
if
this
man
that
illinois
had
this
statute
and
you
haven't
--
not
heeding
new
york
request,
default
and
with
relation
to
illinois
who
gives
that
this
is
lack
of
motive
to
the
united
states.
what
do
you
say
to
that
case?
has
that
any
bearing
at
all
on
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
as
far
as
due
process
is
concerned,
what
kind
of
safeguard
were
protected
there,
that
are
not
protected
here?
because
i
think
privileges,
immunity
or
unequal
protection
is
not
for
privileges,
immunities
and
for
myself
i
don't
mind
saying
i
think
there's
nothing
in
it
because
there
is
no
discrimination.
everybody
gets
the
same
deal,
a
floridian
citizen
has
indeed
seen
the
difference
with
the
others
but
i
mean
to
see
the
difference
in
many
other
citizens.
do
you
think
the
blackmer
case
has
no
bearing
after
the
egression
of
power
over
just
the
human
beings
who
are
freed
from
the
possible
physical
control
which
is
the
ultimate
power
of
sovereignty
and
yet
he
was
subjected
to
a
condemnation
of
contempt
and
the
seizure
of
property
worth
$100,000
and
all
the
stigmas
as
mentioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
it
is
but
as
to
the
people
that
are
within
it,
and
--
and
constitutionally
speaking,
if
a
fellow
wants
to
take
advantage
of
sunshine
and
all
the
other
favoring
circumstances
of
life
in
florida,
then
to
that
extent,
florida
has
some
control
over
him.
and
it
--
it
could
be
a
response
to
the
kind
of
things
that
is
not
without
justification
and
--
and
i
have
to
press
you
insofar
as
due
process
is
concerned
by
seizing
somebody
whom
you
had
no
control
except
within
your
limits
of
what
greater
--
what
greater
protection
was
there
in
blackmer
than
there
is
here
in
saying,
“you're
within
our
state,
you
enjoy
the
benefits
of
it.
we
have
an
agreement
with
the
state
of
new
york
to
our
advantage
in
a
cause
that
is
morally
a
right
and
indeed
had
to
be
essential
to
the
safety
of
a
society
in
which
you
respond
to
the
subpoena
in
court.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
only
inference
that
has
arisen
in
florida,
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
know
under
the
uniform
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
didn't
mean
that.
i
mean,
florida
they
have
another
application
than
this
one,
have
they
not?
has
it
--
for
--
to
take
witnesses
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
active
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
all
--
all
the
courts
unless
it
has
explicitly
prohibited
power
to
allow
people
on
bail
and
free
them
from
incarceration.

as
to
the
crime

for

of

(voice

witnesses,
not
a
--
a
potential
criminal
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
begin
with
exact
legislation
dealing
with
the
procuring
of
testimony
from
witnesses
and
not
the
process
of
conviction
for
crime.(voice
