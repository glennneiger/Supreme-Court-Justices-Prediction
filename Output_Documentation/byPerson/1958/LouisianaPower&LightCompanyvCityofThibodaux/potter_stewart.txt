(inaudible)
the
leiter
case
was
one
within
historical
jurisdiction
of
equity,
wasn't
an
injunction
being
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
is
true
isn't
it
at
least
in
opinion
this
court
indicates
that
a
federal
constitutional
question
was
involved
in
leiter
to
the
extent
that
one
construction
of
that
state
statute
would
have
raised
federal
constitutional
questions
that
another
construction
would
have
not
raised?
justice
potter
stewart
the
dissent.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
--
is
there
a
federal
constitutional
question
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
for
information
only
because
i
don't
remember
in
that,
in
meredith
against
winter
haven,
and
in
propper
against
clark,
those
are
primarily
the
decisions
relied
upon
by
your
opponent
i
think,
did
either
of
those
involve
the
construction
of
state
statute?
do
you
remember?
it
was
a
just
a
matter
of
a
state
common
law,
it's
a
decisional
law
that's
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
statutory.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
and
your
louisiana
jurisprudence
have
a
--
have
the
distinction
between
law
and
equity
and
suppose
you
don't,
do
you,
it
is
not
based
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
law?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
leiter
case
and
many
of
these
cases
where
this
whole
doctrine
has
generally
been
referred
to
accurately
or
inaccurately
as
one
of
equitable
abstention.
there
is
no
distinction
in
louisiana
between
law
and
equity.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
case
in
which,
that
you
know
of,
that
you
run
into
in
which
the
district
judge
on
his
own
motion
did
what
this
judge
did?
