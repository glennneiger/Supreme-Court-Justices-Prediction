is
a

trying
to
condemn.
you
claim
they
can't
(inaudible)
i
should
think
on
any
declaratory
judgment
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
it
seems
to
me
like
(inaudible)
and
we
got
to
pass
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
whether
this
should
be
done,
and
it
is
going
to
be
more
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.

does
that
go
far
enough
to
say
that
you
will
join
(inaudible)
declaratory
judgment.
justice
tom
c.

it's
not
a
question
on

is
merely
a
question
of

state
court
pass
such
construction,
but
unless
you
are
willing
to
tell
us
you
are
going
to

justice
tom
c.
clark
what
i
understand
by
that,
that
you
are
not
going
to
initiate
in
a
state
court

justice
tom
c.
clark

not
know
as
i
understand
it,

justice
tom
c.
clark
and
if
you
do
not
know
which
one
they
take
up
it
for
(inaudible)
and
if
it
is
to
be
sent
back
(inaudible)
i
should
think
(inaudible)
should
take
steps
immediately
(inaudible)
