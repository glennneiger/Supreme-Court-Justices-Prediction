mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
was
commenced
by
the
city
of
thibodaux
filing
a
suit
in
the
district
court
of
lafourche
parish
state
court,
relying
solely
on
the
authority
of
act
111
of
1900,
an
act
which
had
never
been
interpreted
by
any
state
decision
or
state
court
decision
and
as
far
as
we
know
had
never
been
invoked
before
as
a
basis
for
a
condemnation
proceeding.
the
defendant,
the
louisiana
power
&
light,
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court.
after
a
--
after
removal,
the
defendant
filed
answer
in
which
it
raised
about
eight
of
ten
questions
under
state
law
involving
the
interpretation
of
the
state
act,
the
application
of
the
state
act,
validity
of
the
state
act
and
its
--
and
several
other
questions
of
state
law.
at
the
pre-trial
conference,
the
district
judge
concluded
to
hear
the
issues
of
law
prior
to
going
into
the
matter
of
compensation.
argument
was
held
at
some
great
length
in
the
district
court
on
these
issues
of
law,
and
the
district
court
proceeded
to
exercise
the
questions
of
state
law
and
grant
a
stay
of
proceedings
until
these
questions
should
be
decided
by
a
supreme
court
of
louisiana
interpretation.
his
reasons
for
doing
this
is,
he
points
out,
that
although
the
power
of
eminent
domain
is
inhere
in
the
sovereign,
it
is
never
delegated
to
subdivisions
by
implication
and
that
it
is
a
power
that
is
brought
with
great
peril,
a
possibility
of
abuse.
he
then
finds
that
there
had
been
no
state
decisions
interpreting
this
law,
but
that
there
has
been
an
attorney
general's
opinion
in
1951
which
is
to
the
effect
that
municipalities
do
not
have
the
power
to
condemn
utilities.
he,
therefore,
granted
the
stay,
pending
that
proceeding.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that
was
--
i
was
going
to
come
to
the
specific
answers,
yes.
well
going
--
i'll
go
back
and
fill
in
the
facts.
louisiana
power
&
light
company
operates
in
about
44
parishes
in
the
louisiana
and
the
property
here
involved
in
this
condemnation
suit
was
a
property
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
of
thibodaux.
thibodaux
which
operates
a
municipal
plant
expanded
its
city
limits
and
then
sought
to
bring
this
condemnation
proceeding.
as
i
say
louisiana
power
&
light
operates
a
general
electric
utility,
it
generates
electricity
at
remote
points
from
thibodaux
and
monroe,
louisiana
and
in
new
orleans,
louisiana,
transmits
that
by
high
power
transmission
lines
and
then
distributes
it
in
thibodaux.
i
bring
this
point
out
because
part
of
the
property
involved
here
is
not
just
a
property
within
the
city,
new
city
limits
of
thibodaux,
but
it
is
that
portion
that
was
built,
that
capacity
that
was
built
in
all
the
way
back
to
the
power
plant
for
the
purpose
of
serving
this
area,
which
is
one
of
the
questions
as
to
the
applicability
of
this
act.
now
this
act
of
1900
speaks
of
--
says
that
municipality
can
condemn
a
plant
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
if
the
person
owning
the
plant
owns
two
or
more
utility
plants
such
as
water
plant,
gas
plant
at
the
city
condemning
this,
condemn
all
of
the
plants.
and
so
the
question
or
one
of
the
questions
state
law
arising
here
is
whether
the
city
would
be
required
in
this
case
to
condemn
the
entire
property
of
the
louisiana
power
&
light
which
would
raise
a
question
as
to
its
state
constitutionality,
if
it
was
so
interpreted.
that
is,
courtesy
of
--
in
one
parish
operate
a
general
utility
system
throughout
the
state
of
louisiana.
going
on
to
the
--
i
might
add
here
also
the
city
of,
the
city
is
seeking
here
also
to
condemn
the
right
of
the
louisiana
power
&
light
to
operate
in
this
section
of
the
city,
that
is
its
franchise.
now
louisiana
power
&
light
operates
in
that
section
by
virtue
of
three
franchises
granted
by
the
parish
of
lafourche
prior
to
the
taking
in
of
this
territory
by
the
city
and
the
reason
that
the
city
wants
to
expropriate
a
portion
of
those
franchise
rights
in
this
area
is
for
the
reason
that
the
rates
charged
by
the
city
to
its
inhabitants
for
residential
service
are
approximately
55%
higher
than
the
rates
charged
by
louisiana
power
&
light
company,
so
that
the
city
couldn't
--
would
not
long-haul
to
any
customers
if
they
took
the
property,
if
we
still
had
the
right
to
operate
in
that
territory.
so
--
and
we
--
we
say
that
a
careful
examination
of
the
statute
will
show
that
they
are
not
specifically
granted
a
right
to
acquire
a
franchise
or
a
portion
of
the
franchise.
well
as
i
say
we
raise
about
eight
or
nine
different
questions
of
state
law
in
this
proceeding
and
unless
the
court
wants
to
me,
i
won't
go
into
them
all,
it
took
about
an
hour's
argument
before
the
district
court.
when
the
order
of
--
the
sale
order
was
entered
by
the
district
court,
the
city
of
thibodaux
appealed
and
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
order
was
an
interlocutory
order
which
is
not
appealable
under
the
judicial
code,
section
1291.
the
court
of
appeal
consolidated
the
appeal
and
the
motion
to
dismiss,
both
argued
the
same
time.
in
argument
on
the
–
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
city
of
thibodaux
argued
that
this
was,
this
stay
order
was
in
effect
an
injunction
setting
the
doctrine
stemming
from
the
(inaudible)
case.
in
other
words,
that
in
granting
a
stay
the
district
court
was
acting
as
a
chancellor
in
equity,
staying
a
proceeding
or
enjoining
a
proceeding
on
the
law
side
of
the
case
--
we
--
which
if
it
was
a
in
junction,
would
be
one
of
the
exceptions
provided
in
judicial
code
section
1292
sub
1.
in
the
--
this
doctrine
has
been
(inaudible),
but
in
practically
all
the
cases
citing
this
doctrine
it
has
differentiated
the
action
of
a
court
in
granting
the
stay,
acting
as
a
chancellor
in
equity,
enjoining
a
different
proceeding
and
the
action
of
the
judge
in
the
orderly
process
of
trying
a
case.
in
all
the
cases,
i
admit
that
a
judge
trying
a
case
where
that
law
in
equity
has
the
inherent
power
and
has
discretion
in
handling
the
ordinary
progress
of
the
case
to
grant
a
stay.
we
claim
that
this
is
what
this
is.
this
is
a
exercise
of
the
judge
in
orderly
conduct
of
the
case,
granting
a
stay
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
number
of
cases
which
have
recognized
specifically
right
of
a
court
at
law
as
distinguished
from
equity,
court
at
law
to
grant
a
stay
as
a
matter
of
its
inherent
power.
now
if
--
now
in
this
particular
case
there
was
no
equitable
claim
made.
the
court
simply,
in
the
same
action
before
it,
after
the
hearing
the
evidence
on
the
argument
and
deciding
that
in
view
of
the
general
law
that
the
–
following
erie
v.
tompkins,
that
the
state
interpretation
of
state
statutes
should
be
followed
by
the
federal
court
and
finding
no
guide
of
any
sort
in
the
state
jurisprudence,
exercise
his
prerogative
as
a
court
at
law
in
the
control
of
proceedings
to
stay
that
particular
segment.
now
he
did
not
--
he
did
not
dismiss
the
suit
and
he
still
retained
jurisdiction
insofar
as
federal
question
is
concerned,
insofar
as
the
compensation
is
concerned.
so
we
say
if
this
is
what
it
is,
an
exercise
of
indiscretion
of
the
court,
by
then
this
suit
is
not
appealable,
because
it's
interlocutory
order
clearly.
now
we
come
to
the
second
question
which
we
raise,
which
is
the
question
of
abusive
discretion
and
that
is,
was
the
court
--
if
the
court
in
granting
the
stay
went
so
far
beyond
its
discretion
as
a
court
at
law
as
to
actually
constitute
this
an
injunction
which
makes
the
case
appealable
so
that
it
gets
here,
then
is
his
action
nevertheless
within
his
discretion
as
in
granting
such
a
injunction.
now
we
rely
principally
in
this
connection
on
the
case
of
leiter
minerals,
which
we
believe
is
the
last
pronouncement
in
this
subject
in
controlling,
and
that
was
the
case
on
which
the
district
court
relied,
that's
leiter
minerals
inc.,
versus
united
states,
352
u.s.
220.
in
that
case,
if
i
can
recall
fact
to
you,
the
leiter
filed
a
predatory
action
in
the
state
court
seeking
to
establish
title,
the
suit
was
against
the
mineral
lessee
of
the
united
states
government
and
he
sought
to
establish
title
under
an
interpretation
of
a
1940
louisiana
statute.
the
united
states
government
and
the
lessee
went
into
the
federal
court
and
brought
a
suit
to
quite
title,
and
also
asked
for
an
injunction
staying
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
the
court
below
granted
the
injunction
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
and
directed
the
district
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case.
this
court,
however,
affirmed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
affirmed
the
issuing
of
the
injunction
staying
state
proceedings,
but
then
directed
the
district
judge
to
stay
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
until
such
time
as
a
determination
could
be
made
of
the
state
law,
of
interpretation
of
state
statute,
by
the
state
courts
of
louisiana
and
we
say
that
this
is
precisely
the
same
situation
as
in
that
case.
now
we
also
cite
and
rely
on
the
spector
case,
spector
motor
company
case,
which
involved
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
tax
on
the
ground
that
it
pins
down
the
communist
power.
in
that
case
also,
this
court
held
that
a
stay
should
be
granted
until
such
time
as
the
case
could
be
determined
or
the
statute
interpreted
by
a
connecticut
court.
there
are
two
leading
cases
which
might
be
considered
in
conflict
with
this.
one
of
them
is
the
case
of
meredith
versus
winter
haven,
involving
a
suit
to
enjoin
--
a
suit
involving
a
question
of
florida
law.
in
that
case
the
federal
district
court
had
decided
the
case
under
florida
law
against
the
plaintiff.
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
affirmed
the
dismissal,
but
made
it
without
prejudice
to
the
plaintiff
proceeding
in
the
florida
court.
and
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
the
--
that
this
thing,
the
diversity
citizenship
case,
that
it
could
not
--
the
federal
court
could
not
just
relax
all
of
its
jurisdiction
and
dismiss
a
suit,
it
had
--
and
that
is
a
case
that
has
very
frequently
cited.
i
think
there
are
two
differences
or
distinctions
with
that
case.
in
the
first
place
here
the
court
has
retained
jurisdiction,
the
district
court
has,
and
as
to
the
compensation
question
and
as
to
the
questions,
federal
questions
and
had
just
temporarily
stayed
proceedings.
and
furthermore
in
the
florida
case,
the
meredith
versus
winter
haven,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
passed
on
this
very
point,
which
was
--
which
the
federal
court
was
asked
to
pass
on.
the
argument
was
simply
that
they
would
probably
overrule
this
previous
decision
because
a
certain
argument
had
not
been
made
to
them,
so
that
there
was
a
guide
by
which
the
federal
court
could
go
in
an
existing
final
interpretation
of
the
law
by
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that's
right,
in
other
words
its
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
there
is
--
it
begins
with
act
number
1011
of
1900.
that
is
the
sole
authority
for
this
action.
without
that
act
the
city
would
have
no
authority
per
se.
now
we
say
that,
that
act
is
deficient
from
several
respects
in
authorizing
the
city
to
bring
this
suit.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
it's
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
the
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yeah,
that's
the
question.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
the
act
is
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
city's
briefs,
the
bound
--
now
we
say
this
is
an
--
we
have
raised
quite
a
number
of
questions
under
this,
because
since
1900
there
have
been
a
number
of
accidents
which
apparently
conflict
with
this
--
this
act.
for
example
there
is
an
act
which
says
that
no
utility
and
utility
is
defined
as
any
person,
shall
serve
a
customer
of
another
utility
without
first
obtaining
permission
of
the
public
service
commission.
now
that
apparently
would
--
and
it's
admitted
here
that
they've
got
no
permission,
and
there
is
another
order
of
the
public
service
commission
outstanding
which
is
apparently
valid,
which
says
that
no
utility
shall
transfer
any
property
which
it
owns,
to
another
without
getting
its
permission,
so
whether
the
necessary
authority
exists
for
the
basis
of
this
suit.
now
we
also
raise
questions
here
considering
obligation
of
contract.
the
city
of
thibodaux
in
1948,
this
question
arose
with
the
city
of
thibodaux.
the
city
of
thibodaux
wanted
an
industrial
customer,
the
coca
cola
company
and
they
wanted
to
serve
a
college
was
newly
being
built
just
outside
their
city
limits
and
they
proceeded
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
louisiana
power
&
light
company
which
is
printed
in
i
think
page
36
in
the
record,
in
which
they
agreed
that
if
we
would
transfer
this
industrial
customer
and
this
college
to
them
for
service
that
they
would
recognize
our
rights
to
continue
indefinitely
to
serve
in
a
territory
which
was
then
served,
which
is
the
territory
here
in
question.
so
we
say
that
is
a
valid
contract
plus
the
city
contested
that
contract,
we
say
it's
a
valid
contract
and
reliance
thereon
we
built
(inaudible)
there
and
that
any
attempt
to
take
our
rights
to
serve
in
there
would
be
a
violation,
particularly
if
we
establish
that
it's
a
valid
contract.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
this
has
sort
of
the
gilbert
and
sullivan
looked
to
it.
i
must
admit
the
statute
which,
under
which
this
suit
was
brought
we
considered,
gave
a
very,
a
cause
of
remedy
which
we
considered
very
prejudicial
to
ourselves.
for
example,
it
provides
for
the
appointment
of
six
commissioners
by
the
court
and
these
six
commissioners
are
to
go
and
view
the
property,
appraise
it
and
make
a
report
within
15
days.
well,
suffice
it
to
say
i
don't
think
you
could
possibly
even
inventory
properly
of
this
description
of
utility
system
within
15
days
and
of
course
these
six
commissioners,
if
you,
the
record
will
show,
were
appointed
by
the
judge
the
same
day
that
the
suit
was
filed,
even
before
we
were
served.
the
act
makes
no
provision
for
giving
evidence
to
these
commissioners.
it
makes
no
provision
for
hearings
or
for
cross
examining
witnesses,
it
does
say
that
after
they
have
filed
their
report
in
the
court
that
any
party
can
object
and
the
case
will
be
tried
out
the
usual
manner.
but
when
you
got
–
go
into
court
and
you
have
six
so
called
impartial
experts
put
in
a
testimony
you
then
have
a
great
burden
if
you
are
going
to
contest
it.
and
so
--
in
addition
to
that
the
act
provides
for
a
summary
appeal
with
no,
we
call
it
suspended
deal
no
supercilious.
so
we
considered
that
this
procedure
and
this
act
would
be
very
prejudicial
to
us
and
so
we
removed
as
we
of
course
had
the
right
to
do.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
we
do
not
pray
for
that.
the
district
court
came
to
that
conclusion
itself.
now
why
are
we
satisfied
with
that,
we
--
that
isn't
the,
the
interpretation
of
the
state
law
isn't
the
reason
that
we
removed
it,
the
legal
crisis.
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
far
as
we
have
are
concerned
we
think
the
district
court
was
right
in
the
proper
of
working
out
of
the
two
systems
of
law,
harmonious
working
out,
i
think
its
correct
since
erie
versus
tompkins
is
the
law
and
we
are
going
to
have
to
follow
it
state
decision
anyway,
why
make
a
preliminary
guess
about
it.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yeah
entirely
following
the
leiter
case.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes
it's
changed
right,
yes
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yeah.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that's
right,
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
but
i
think
a
careful
analysis
will
show
that
this
is
right
within
the,
within
the
leiter
decision,
because
i
think
its
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
no,
not
exactly.
it
was
a
suit
to
quite
title
and
an
injunction
was
asked
to
stay
the
proceedings
in
the
court
and
that
was
granted.
now
and
that
was
the
way
the
case
came
to
this
court.
but
this
court
also
said
we
will
stay
the
proceedings
to
quite
title
in
the
federal
court
and
in
a
state
proceeding.
now
proceedings
of
quite
title
in
louisiana
--
louisiana
--
the
distinction
between
--
and
as
legal
action
is
unknown
and
so
it
is
a
statutory
proceeding
and
i
would
guess
it
was
a
legal
proceeding
and
they
still,
they
stayed
in
that
leiter
case,
in
my
opinion
a
legal
proceeding.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
majority
opinion
said
that
was
and
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
the
dissent
said
it
was
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
we
think
there
is
that,
here
so
we
think
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
question
here
of,
in
connection
with
the,
violation
obligation
of
contract,
we
have
alleged
that
we
have
a
contract
here
with
the
city,
also
alleged
our
franchise
with
the
parish
of
constituted
contract.
now
i
say
that
in
considering
whether
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question
you
got
to
concede
that
all
of
these
state
questions
that
we
have
raised
are
decided
in
our
favor
that
that
contract
is
valid.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
the,
i,
in
the
meredith
case
it
was
a
question
of
whether
the
city
could
refund
bonds
without
paying
the
deferred
interest
coupons.
however,
at
the
best
i'd
imagine
that
would
rest
on
its
own
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
propper
and
clark
i
think
the
other
way
it
was
a
question
of
the
law
of
new
york
as
to
whether
title
vested
when
a
moment
they
receiver
was
appointed.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
am
sorry
i
really
don't
know
where
it
is.
i
would
have
liked
to.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
i
do
know
what
happened
to
the
spector
case,
it
was
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
would
say
that
the
controlling
thing
in
this
matter,
i
would
like
to
quote
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
language,
in
the
dissent
in
propper
versus
clark
and
that,
because
i
think
there
is
a
issue
in
this
case.
so
here
there
are
no
constitutional
issue
is
present
with
regard
for
the
respective
orbits
of
state
and
federal
tribunal
is
the
best
of
reasons
as
a
matter
of
judicial
administration
for
requiring
a
definitive
adjudication
in
new
york
courts,
rather
than
a
proceeding
in
the
basis
of
own
counter
guess.
i
think
the
issue
here
in
these
various
cases,
various
reasons
have
been
assigned
particularly
for
acquittal
jurisdiction,
diversity
or
something
for
either
denying
or
granting.
but
i
think
the
overriding
consideration
here
is
the
whether
this
thing
should
be
decided
in
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court.
for
instance
in
propper
versus
clark
there
is
a
significant
statement
by
justice
reed.
he
says
the
congressional
purpose
to
control
of
foreign
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
president
through
the
custodian
so
there
might
be
a
uniform
national
policy
in
the
administration
of
the
act
edges
strongly
for
federal
determination
of
issues
of
rights
in
black
assets.
in
other
words
he
felt
that
way
that
a
consideration
was
the
federal
policy
interest
in
that
alien
--
that
--
trading
with
enemy
act.
i
will
save
a
minute
if
i
have
it.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yes.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
we
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
we
claim
number
one,
well
in
our
answer
set
out
all
of
our
claims,
but
one
of
the
things,
it
never
mentions
the
word
franchise
for
example,
in
authorizing
the
construction.
number
two
it
says
when
you
acquire
a
plant
you
should
acquire
the
whole
plant.
now
this
was
--
well
this
act
was
written
in
1900
when
electric
utility
systems
consisted
of
one
plant
in
one
city,
they
were
not
integrated
service
from
central
station.
the
answer
is
yes,
we
have
a
number
of
contentions
with
regard
to
the
act,
also
contentions
that
it's
been
superseded
by
other
acts
in
certain
respects.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
thank
you
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
first
about
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
this
court
held
in
the
leiter
case
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
was
an
adequate
remedy
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
it
will
show
that
it
is,
it's
a
model
to
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
the
city
cites
a
section
which
has
to
do
with
moot
cases
where
the
case
is
moot
and
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide,
well
that's
a
usual
rule,
but
i
think
a
consideration
of
it
will
show
that
it's
adequate.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
no,
we
have
not.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
the
city
has
not
asked
for
one,
we
are
satisfied
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well,
i
think
it's
rather
up
to
the
city,
because
they
are
bringing
this
condemnation
to
the
city.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
no,
said
court,
we
didn't
ask
for
that.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
we
are
finally
interested
in
having
the
act
construed
by
the
state
court.
we
are
in
that
position
now,
yeah.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
don't
know
whether
we
have
right
to
bring
it
or
not,
because
we
are
not
offering
to
sell
a
property.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well,
maybe
we
could
file
but
i
don't
see
any
necessity
for
us
filing
and
i
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well,
it
was
not
our
intention
to
make
any
delay
in
this
case
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
that's
right
it
will
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
we
will
state
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
will
make
that
firm
statement
to
this
entire
court,
yes.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
don't
see
that
the
burden
is
on
us
your
honor,
but
that
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well,
the
city
is
a
moving
party
in
this,
but
answering
another
question,
if
the
lower
court
should
decide
in
favor
of
the
city
we
would
appeal
or
the
city
would
always
have
its
remedy
of
going
back
to
judge
wright
and
say,
the
company
will
not
appeal.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
no
it
would
have
to
go
to
the
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
right.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
yeah
right.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
i
have
any
objection
to
starting
a
declaratory
judgment.
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
do
so,
because
after
all
i
have
been
in
position
of
defendants
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
-
that's
right.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well,
i
think
i
have
stated
my
position,
i
am
entirely
willing
to
proceed
in
the
state
court,
i
am
simply
not
going
to
delay
on
any
proceedings,
but
i
think
it's
in
--
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
well,
i
think
i
would
do
so
if
this
court
said
that
was
essential.
mr.
j.
raburn
monroe
i
wouldn't
think
so,
i
would
think
if
the
city
of
thibodaux
would
proceed
immediately
and
i
would
--
