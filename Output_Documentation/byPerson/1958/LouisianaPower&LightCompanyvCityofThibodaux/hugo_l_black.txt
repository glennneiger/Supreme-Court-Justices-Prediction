justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
provision
is
set
out
in
your
brief,
provision
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
controversy
is
that
whether
that
should
be
send
back
to
the
state
court
to
conclude?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
court
did
the
state
court
send
it
back,
rather
the
district
court
sent
it
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
claiming
in
this
(inaudible)
i
have
just
read
it
and
i
don't
see
any
ambiguity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
mean
to
be
construed
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you,
as
i
gather
from
what
you
said,
you
agree
that
there
are
circumstances,
exceptional
circumstances
on
which
the
court
should
stay
the
issues
and
hand
such
state
issues
back
for
determination
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
case
has
indicated
that
if
there
are
issues
to
be
decided,
there
is
a
(inaudible)
consideration
that
the
court
does
now
refer
those
issues
to
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
very
close
to
it
is
of
course
is
the
bankruptcy
case
if
you
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
i
mean
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
hope
you
will
discuss,
before
you
sit
down
(inaudible)
as
suit,
the
court
does
have
that
power,
why
should
they
not
do
it?
what
are
they
arguing?
what
is
the
injury
that
would
occur?
are
you
arguing
that
the
statutory
questions
are
so
simple
and
so
plain
that
they
should
be
sent
back
because
this
is
peculiarly
a
matter
of
state
law
i
should
think
as
to
the
powers
(inaudible)
what
i'd
like
you
to
do
is
discuss
it
on
practical
basis
rather
than
on
the
legal
basis
of
whether
one
case
is
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
those
words.
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
why
shouldn't
it
have
done
it
according
to
your
view?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
a
question
of
construction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
practical
injuries
that
will
occur
to
the
city
of
â€“
here
if
this
is
sent
back
to
state
to
interpret
its
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
suggested
to
the
opposing
counsel
at
any
time
since
they
moved
the
case
in
there
and
they
want
federal
judges
instead
of
the
state
court
to
pass
on
that
case
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason,
would
it
be
much
delay
if
they
were
demanded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
appealed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
tried
and
they
wouldn't
do
it,
then
you
could
go
back
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
if
you
took
it
back
there
and
the
other
side
objected,
go
to
the
state
court,
federal
court
wouldn't
hesitate
very
long,
and
go
ahead
and
try
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
question
about
the
ability
of
the
city
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
been
said
about
a
bond
or
an
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
(inaudible)
the
city
is
being
held
up
in
gravy
i
should
suppose
the
city
might
have
raised
some
question
about
applying
a
bond,
but
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
wouldn't
have
prevented
you
asking
the
judge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
the
question
really
should
be
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court.
i
would
think
that
would
be
most
likely
(inaudible)
so
i
doubt
if
people
decide
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
dissented
in
that
case,
but
i
assume
what
you
are
saying
is
i
am
bound
by
that
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
did
not
require
an
action
within
a
reasonable
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
require?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
asked
for
one
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
you
are
one
that
sent
back
to
the
same
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
are
the
one
(inaudible)
