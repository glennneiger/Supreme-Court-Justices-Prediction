justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
–
the
one
thing
i
am
–
would
like
you
to
enlighten
me,
--
what
questions
there
are
in
this
litigation,
that
have
any
substantiality
on
which
state
law
determinations
become
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
way
around,
if
you
dispel
claim
that
there
is
nothing
here
on
which
the
state
court
could
shed
light?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
at
the
heart
of
this
(inaudible)
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
comparable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
entirely
sua
sponte
by
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
same
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
you
must
told
by
us
(inaudible)
state
got
instruction
on
what
the
state
law
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
ought
to
get
state
court
instruction
and
the
court
of
appeals
no,
you
have
no
business
as
to
that,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
propper
the
other
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
mr.
monroe
will
you
yield
some
of
your
time
to
ask
what
happened
to
the
leiter
case
after
it
went
back
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
case
just
curiosity
–
and
when
disposed
of
cases
here
i
want
to
know
what
happens
to
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
case
came
back
to
us
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
thing
is
the
disposition
that
was
made
by
the
district
judge,
what
you
denominate
a
refusal
to
decide
or
does
he
just
stays
his
hand
and
wait
determination
by
the
state
court
of
these
supposedly
state
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
have
to
defer
to
state
court's
decisions
on
those
issues,
if
in
fact
they
had
been
in
existence
through
decisions
of
your
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
stand
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
on
the
assumption
that
this
came
as
a
surprise
to
both
sides
that
you
are
right
–
decide
to
have
a
state
court
interpretation
after
he
directed
--
suggested
or
directed
i
suppose
that
state
court
interpretation
be
sought,
did
your
parish
make
the
representations
you
now
make
here
or
the
suggestions
of
all
the
difficulties
in
carrying
out
his
--
desire
to
be
informed
rather
than
grope
in
the
dark?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
did
come
as
a
surprise
to
both
of
you?
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
came
as
an
exercise
of
judicial
discretion
by
a
judge
who
is
not
i
believe
notorious
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
mr.
monroe
(inaudible)
we
have
more
confidence
than
the
average
judge
in
the
parish
could
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it's
a
question
of
power,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
gamut
of
obligation
(inaudible)
depends
so
much
on
the
conception
of
allegedly
conflicting
state
laws
and
it's
the
state
law
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
strange,
from
my
point
of
view,
very
strange
construction
as
to
what
the
state
committed
itself
and
they
have
got
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
inferred
what
you
said
that
he
was
--
that
there
was
question
in
his
mind
in
the
construction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
might,
it
is
conceivable
that
even
your
supreme
court
might
find
might
describe
(inaudible)
that
is
conceivable
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
would
never
find
a
flaw
in
the
decisions
of
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
think
the
demand,
i
think
your
litigation
is
a
model
of
these
compared
to
that
ohio
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
forgotten
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
remember
that
that
really
was
a
snail
like
process,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
is
the
other
side,
neither
is
the
judge
wright,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
--
except
that
they
availed
themselves
of
removal
to
which
you
know
like
the
whole
of
(inaudible)
removal
i
take
it
properly
from
my
point
of
view
and
now
you
are
holding
to
it
and
they
remove,
and
now
they
want
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
state
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
bring
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
is
your
affirmative
position
that
you
will
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
will
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
will
delay
the
promotion
of
the
earlier
possible
compliance
that
judge
wright
desire
(inaudible)
what
is
controlling
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
here
under
the
(inaudible)
judgment
law,
you
couldn't
go
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
first
instance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
judge
wright
said
he
would
like
know
what
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
speaking
for
myself,
(inaudible)
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand
(inaudible)
in
getting
this
rule
which
you
did
not
solicit
(inaudible)
in
order
to
expose
the
state
of
the
litigation,
which
is
in
the
face
where
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
evidence
controvert
with
the
state,
the
judge
wright
was
within
administrative
judicial
discretion
so
(inaudible)
would
the
state
have
any
reason
for
not
--
for
blocking
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
