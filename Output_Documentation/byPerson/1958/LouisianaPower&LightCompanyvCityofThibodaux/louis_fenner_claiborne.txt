mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
question
raised
by
the
granting
of
the
writ
here,
was
the
one
of
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
issue
the
stay
order.
the
question
of
appealability
of
that
stay
order,
which
has
been
discussed
by
opposing
counsel,
was
expressly
eliminated
by
the
order
of
granting
the
writ,
the
order
of
this
court
granting
the
writ.
as
to
the
question
whether
the
district
court
had
a
right
as
a
matter
of
power
to
grant
the
stay
of
proceedings
before
it,
we
had
not
anticipated
that
question.
in
fact,
we
had
conceded
it
before
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeal
and
only
took
it
up
at
the
invitation
of
this
court.
however,
having
once
investigated
it,
we
found
that
it
was
very
doubtful,
though
not
at
all
definite,
whether
this
type
of
order,
in
this
type
of
case
was
authorized,
as
distinct
from
the
question
of
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
not.
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
and
that's
all
we've
dealt
with
on
this
question,
is
to
the
effect
that
a
court
in
an
equitable
proceeding,
a
court
appealed
to
on
the
equity
side,
may
grant
such
as
a
stay
order.
it
has
been
allowed
also
in
cases
involving
admiralty,
bankruptcy
and
even
in
a
couple
a
law
cases,
strictly
law
cases
as
distinguished
from
admiralty
or
bankruptcy.
however,
in
those
two
cases,
the
only
two
law
cases
involved,
the
stay
was
found
necessary
only
because
of
a
necessary
preliminary
administrative
ruling
or
because
the
statute
involved
directed
that
the
preliminary
determination
be
made
by
another
agency
before
the
question
came
before
a
court.
there
is
no
ordinary
civil
case
in
which
this
court
has
either
authorized
or
directed
a
stay
of
proceedings.
there
is,
however,
language
in
two
cases
to
the
affect
that
stay
orders
are
authorized
because
of
the
inherent
power
of
all
courts
to
conduct
their
proceedings
in
orderly
manner.
we
invite
this
court
to
a
distinction
here.
we
grant
the
fact
that
every
court
is
entitled
to
control
the
proceedings
before
it,
whether
it's
sitting
in
law
or
sitting
in
equity,
and
of
course
to
grant
continues
--
continuances
to
delay
its
decision
in
any
case,
for
a
reasonable
time,
for
a
proper
cause.
and
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it
delays
its
decision
because
it's
curious
to
know
what
another
tribunal
in
a
similar
case
is
going
to
do.
we
think
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
in
this
case,
for
the
district
court
to
say
there
is
another
case
pending
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
which
is
going
to
pass
on
this
question,
it
is
only
proper
that
we
await
that
determination,
which
will
not
control
ours,
but
which
may
guide
ours
and
which
may
under
the
erie
versus
tompkins
case,
insofar
as
it's
applicable
to
this
case,
even
control
this
case.
but
that
is
a
very
different
thing
from
telling
parties
properly
before
the
court,
we
refuse
to
decide
your
case,
go
back
to
the
state
court.
we'll
leave
it
up
to
the
state
court
to
decide
this
issue
at
least
in
your
controversy.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no
your
honor
that's
correct
and
he
presumably
would
eventually
pass
on
the
federal
issues
involved
if
there
are
any
and
he
would
eventually
pass
on
the
question
of
a
quantum,
the
amount
of
the
award
for
condemnation.
but
he
--
because
there
is
no
state
court
action
pending
and
no
prospect
of
any,
he
presumably
does
intend
to
defer
to
the
state
court
decision
on
the
interpretation
of
this
louisiana
act.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
under
erie
versus
tompkins
your
honor
i
think
he
would
have
to
follow
them
and
apply
them,
yes.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
that's
correct
you
honor,
provided
that
it
is
done
either
in
suit
in
equity,
that
is
a
refusal
to
enjoin
state
action,
that
i
think
a
court
of
equity
has
the
power
to
do.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no
it
go
further,
it
admits
these
exceptional
cases
in
bankruptcy,
admiralty
and
the
cases
where
the
preliminary
agency
determination,
whether
it's
a
state
agency
or
a
federal
agency
is
necessary
to
the
district
court's
decision.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
your
honor,
there
is
no
decision
by
this
court
in
which
this
type
of
case,
that
is
an
ordinary
law
case
has
--
and
in
which
there
is
no
statute
involved
which
requires
a
preliminary
determination,
there
is
no
decision
by
this
court
authorizing
such
as
stay
of
proceedings
in
this
certain
case.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
yes
which
is
essentially
equitable.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
your
honor,
pre-emitting
the
question
of
power
and
getting
simply
to
the
second
question
presented,
which
is
whether
the
court
in
this
particular
instance
abused,
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
or
not?
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
for
several
reasons.
first
this
suite
unlike
most
of
the
suites
in
which
this
has
--
this
procedure
has
been
authorized,
does
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
administration
of
its
own
laws
by
the
state.
this
is
not
a
proceeding
to
enjoin
a
state
official
from
doing
something.
it's
not
a
proceeding
to
stop
a
pending
state
action.
it's
not
a
proceeding
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
tax.
there
is
no
state
action
which
is
effected
by
this
--
by
a
decision
of
the
federal
district
court.
it's
simply
one
of
applying
a
local
law
to
local
circumstances,
which
is
that
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well,
as
to
whether
or
not
its
difficult
to
apply
this
law,
it's
alleged
that
this
is
an
old
law
since
1900
and
that
it
has
never
been
interpreted
in
the
last
59
years,
that
appears
to
be
true,
though
no
one
knows
whether
the
district
courts
of
louisiana
have
applied
this
law
many
times
or
few
times,
it
has
never
been
appealed,
that's
all
we
can
say.
however,
it
does
not
follow
that
because
a
law
has
not
been
interpreted,
it's
unclear.
we
see
nothing
and
clear
about
the
law.
furthermore
we
think
it's
easier
for
a
court
to
determine
the
state
law
when
there
are
no
decisions
then
when
there
is
a
conflict,
the
confusion
of
decisions.
here
we
have
a
law
which
as
your
honor
said
on
its
face
is
quite
clear.
it
reads
very
simply,
the
only
pertinent
thought
of
it
is
the
first
section
which
is
quoted
on
page
23
and
24
of
the
brief.
there
are
no
serious
questions
that
arise
under
it.
a
lot
has
been
manufactured
as
in
every
law
case
because
they
will
be
found
or
attempted
to
be
found
gaps,
loopholes
in
the
law.
all
of
those
attacks
on
this,
on
the
application
of
this
particular
law
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
were
answered
by
memorandum
filed
in
the
district
court.
if
this
court
is
interested
in
the
substance
of
those
arguments,
we'll
be
glad
to
furnish
the
court
with
copies.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
your
honor
the
--
now
i
have
to
go
somewhere
out
of
the
record,
well
this
much
is
in
the
record
here
the
city
files
its
suit
in
state
court
expecting
to
have
the
matter
determined
there.
the
suit
is
removed
to
federal
court,
already
one
delay.
this
is
a
condemnation
suit,
one
that
normally
is
handled
speedily,
concluded
quickly.
it
goes
to
the
federal
court,
the
judge
takes
a
long
time
to
decide
whether
he
is
going
to
decide
it
or
not
and
finally
decides
that
he
is
not
going
to
decide
which
--
and
tells
us
to
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
he
tells
us
that
we
must
obtain
an
interpretation
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
of
this
particular
statute
before
he
will
do
another
thing
in
the
case.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well,
it's
--
first
it's
time
consuming.
secondly,
it
might
be
impossible
because
of
this
situation.
if
we
can
obtained
a
declaratory
judgment,
which
is
what
the
district
judge
suggest
in
the
state
court,
suppose
the
declaration
is
in
our
favor,
we
can't
appeal
from
the
favorable
ruling
the
company's
attitudes
throughout
this
whole
proceeding,
and
i
don't
blame
them
for
it,
is
to
delay
this
expropriation
as
long
as
possible.
they
quite
legitimately
would
refuse
to
appeal
it.
this
louisiana
supreme
court
would
have
no
occasion
to
pass
on
it.
now
this
is
what
we
would
anticipate,
this
is
what
we
would
expect
to
happen
since
we
have
confidence
in
our
courts.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no,
but
we
would
have
to
then
go
back
to
judge
wright
and
ask
him
now
is
this
sufficient
for
the
judging
this
particular
parish.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no,
your
honor
we
have
not,
we
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
yes
your
honor
because
the
question
is
now
ripe
for
decision
in
the
district
court
assuming
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
were
(inaudible).
if
we
had
to
(inaudible)
remand
the
case
back
to
the
state
court,
we
have
to
go
through
the
procedure
of
the
appointment
of
viewers
and
then
finally
have
an
appeal
to
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no,
your
honor
we
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
it
did,
it
did
and
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no,
your
honor,
you
are
right.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
we
appealed,
the
city
appealed
your
honor,
i
believe
simply
on
the
question
of
whether
the
stay
order
was
proper
enough.
now
to
get
back
to
the
practical
considerations
your
honor
the
city
has
had
to
float
a
bond
issue
anticipating
this
expropriation.
it
had
to
make
commitments.
now
i
am
going
outside
of
the
record
in
this
respect,
but
it
is
understandable
that
this
would
be
involved
in
an
expropriation
by
a
municipality
necessarily
involved.
all
of
that
has
had
to
wait
for
over
two
years
since
this
action
was
filed
and
the
only
reason
for
that
delay
has
been
because
of
the
stay
order
entered
in
the
district
court
proceedings.
now
whether
we
could
go
back
to
state
court
itself
is
a
question,
quite
outside
of
getting
to
louisiana
supreme
court
to
pass
on
it,
there
is
a
question
whether
the
district
court
would
accept
the
case.
our
declaratory
judgment
act
which
is
quoted
in
appendix
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well,
i
suppose
we
have
no
alternative
what
to
ask
judge
wright
for
a
modification
of
his
ruling
or
a
withdrawal
of
it,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
modify
it
to
help
us.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
and
quite
understandably
the
company
was
delighted
with
the
delay
produced
by
the
ruling.
they
have
been
fighting
an
expropriation.
they
are
trying
to
say
that
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
it.
there's
no
argument
about
the
amount
of
money
involved
here.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
city
is
going
to
be
able
to
take
this
property
or
not.
now
i
want
to
stress
the
distinction
between
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no
your
honor
the
money
has
already
been
appropriated
through
a
bond
issue
and
is
set
aside
and
is
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
it's
completely
a
question
of
power.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
in
–
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well,
yes
the
judge
himself
is
responsible
for
the
stay
orders,
the
company
is
not.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well,
it's
not
so
much
a
matter
of
the
bond,
your
honor.
here
--
the
situation
is
this
in
thibodaux.
we
have
a
municipality
which
has
extended
its
boundaries.
in
this
new
--
it
furnishes
electricity
to
the
people
in
the
old
area.
it
naturally
wants
to
extend
its
municipal
system
to
the
new
area.
it
attempted
to
purchase
and
was
unsuccessful.
the
only
solution
is
to
expropriate.
in
the
meantime
it's
giving
all
the
benefits
of
the
city
to
these
new
residents
and
not
getting
it
back
from
them
the
high
electric
rates
which
go
to
pay
for
the
city
service,
so
the
city
(inaudible)
money.
on
the
other
hand
the
money
that
it
got
from
its
residents
through
the
bond
issue
has
been
accruing
interest,
but
they
built
a
substation
which
they
can't
use
until
such
time
this
matter
is
decided.
now
i
wish
to
emphasize
if
i
may
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
two
cases
which
have
preceeded
it
on
at
least
two
grounds.
first
here
there
is
no
as
distinguished
in
the
first
case,
no
constitutional
issue
involved.
any
constitutional
--
federal
constitutional
question,
the
only
one
that
has
been
raised
is
the
question
of
impairment
of
contract.
well
now
that
question
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1848
in
the
west
river
bridge
versus
dix
case.
it
was
very
clearly
decided
that
a
franchise
was
property
and
was
subject
to
expropriation.
a
few
years
later
in
the
water-supply
company
it
was
decided
that
a
contract
between
the
city
and
a
company
to
furnish
all
power
--
or
water
in
that
case
was
likewise
property
subject
to
expropriation.
there
is
no
bonafide
substantial
federal
constitutional
question
here.
so
that
there
is
no
excuse
to
saying
we
will
differ
passing
on
the
constitutional
question
because
it
maybe
eliminated
by
a
state
court
interpretation
of
its
own
law.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well,
your
honor
here
the
only
admitted
claim
of
the
company
is
a
franchise
which
is
a
perfectly
ordinary
limited
franchise
to
operate
over
the
roads
of
the
parish
and
put
up
their
telephone
poles
and
lines.
now
there
is
no
question
whatever
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
but
that
that
type
of
franchise
even
in
this
case,
a
limited
franchise
not
an
exclusive
one,
is
subject
to
expropriation.
it
was
granted
subject
to
the
inherent
right
of
the
state
and
its
municipality
that
delves
into
it
to
withdraw
it
and
to
inject
that
and
say
there's
a
constitutional
question
is
possible
in
any
case,
but
that
is
no
excuse
here
for
the
refusal
to
decide
the
case.
now
also
as
distinguished
for
most
of
the
cases
and
as
distinguished
from
the
two
cases
previously
argued,
there
is
here
no
conflict
between
state
action
and
federal
action.
this
is
not
a
suit
to
enjoin
state
officials
of
state
action.
it
is
not
a
proceeding
in
equity.
it's
a
proceeding
at
law.
it
is
not
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
based
on
diversity.
now,
i
know
that
federal
jurisdiction
should
be
a
strong
--
whether
it's
based
on
diversity
or
whether
it's
based
on
the
existence
of
a
federal
question,
but
in
a
federal
question
case
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
an
interpretation
of
the
state
law
involved
will
eliminate
the
federal
question
and
therefore
eliminate
the
federal
jurisdiction
while
in
a
diversity
case
that
possibility
is
impossible.
it
doesn't
exist
for
the
reason
that
diversity
jurisdiction
was
granted
to
federal
courts
after
all
to
decide
state
law
questions
not
federal
questions.
otherwise
it
would
be
unnecessary.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
i
think
your
honor
asked
the
question
in
connection
with
the
leiter
case.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
i
don't
know
that
the
distinction
would
have
to
be
recognized
by
louisiana
law.
this
court
in
applying
the
doctrine
of
abstention
in
the
leiter
case
certainly
recognized
that
the
suit
involved
equitable
relief
at
least
insofar
has
it
enjoined
the
state
court
proceeding
then
in
progress.
insofar
as
further
more
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
the
leiter
case
there
was
a
constitutional
question
which
could
be
avoided
under
one
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
therefore
it
was
appropriate
to
leave
it
to
state
courts
to
interpret
it
first.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
that
is
the
problem
your
honor
before
the
district
court.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
that's
right.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
i
think
i
tried
to
explain
that
there
is
no
real
difficult
problem
of
interpretation
here.
we
have
a
louisiana
statute.
the
petition
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
they
were
--
there
are
no
conflicts
with
later
statutes.
they
were
all
arguments
based
on
the
louisiana
constitution.
now
those
are
arguments
all
soft
edged.
they
can
be
answered
very
readily.
these
constitutional
provisions
are
not
before
this
court.
the
petitioner
did
not
bother
to
bring
them
here.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
judge
wright
did
not
seem
to
find
any
difficulty
with
any
question
except
this
one
which
is
that
in
1900
so
the
judge
(inaudible)
without
any
evidence,
the
municipality
--
the
electric
and
other
public
utilities
were
largely
located
within
the
boundaries
of
the
municipality
and
that
therefore
what
this
statute
contemplated
was
the
taking
of
that
property
within
the
city
limits
and
that
it
was
difficult
to
apply
that
old
statute
in
visiting
that
situation
to
the
modern
situation
where
you
have
an
electric
company
operating
throughout
the
state.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
unless
we
could
find
a
–
well,
i
think
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
the
city
would
have
no
claim
to
condemn
the
property
if
it
goes,
it
must
rely
on
statutory
authority
not
being
sovereign
itself.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
your
honor
it's
difficult
to
tell
from
the
--
some
of
the
decisions
whether
the
judge
did
it
on
his
own
motion
or
not
but
i
had
found
none
in
which
it
is
clear
that
the
judge
did
on
his
own
motion
and
i
am
persuaded
that
judge
wright
did
it
in
this
case
because
he
had
been
reversed
–
finally
reversed
in
the
leiter
case.
in
conclusion
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
i
think
the
judge
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
leiter
decision
and
quite
understandably
became
less
hesitant
to
decide
state
law
questions
thereafter.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
let
me
say
this
also,
the
judge's
doubt
was
based
partly
on
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
which
has
been
referred
to,
louisiana
attorney
general,
which
is
cited
in
appendix
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
now
the
judge,
and
that
was
our
fault
in
argument
for
the
district
court,
did
not
see
the
clear
flaw
in
that
opinion,
that
opinion
makes
no
reference
whatever
to
this
particular
act.
it
is
only
to
be
assumed
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
assistant
attorney
general
who
signed
the
opinion
did
not
find
the
statute
when
he
advised
another
municipality
in
a
similar
case
that
it
could
not
do
what
we
are
trying
to
do.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
it
is
always
conceivable,
your
honor
but
not
very
likely.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
i
wouldn't
say
that
your
honor,
but
in
the
opinion
goes
far
beyond
any
flaw
that
our
supreme
court
(inaudible)
if
i
may
conclude
with
this
quotation
from
public
utilities
commission
of
ohio
versus
united
fuel
gas
company
an
opinion
written
for
a
unanimous
--
for
the
majority
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointing
out
the
times
when
you
do,
when
the
times
when
you
don't
issue
these
stay
orders.
and
in
concluding
in
this
particular
case,
justice
frankfurter
says
the
situation
here
is
quite
different
from
railroad
commission
versus
pullman
company,
312
u.s.
496,
where
the
disposition
of
a
doubtful
question
of
local
law
might
terminate
the
entire
controversy
and
thus
make
it
unnecessary
to
decide
a
substantial
constitutional
question
considerations
of
equity
justify
a
rule
of
abstention,
but
when
as
here,
the
litigation
has
already
been
in
the
federal
court
an
inordinately
long
time
which
parenthetically
is
our
situation,
considerations
of
equity
require
that
the
litigation
be
brought
to
an
end
as
quickly
as
possible.
decree
in
this
case
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
(inaudible)
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
that
was
on
the
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
it
is
only
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
well
it
was
only
two
years,
your
honor
in
the
quotation
i
just
read,
it
says
more
than
two
years
but
in
our
case
it's
also
more
than
two
years,
that
was
all.
but
here
we
have
a
condemnation
proceeding
and
none
of
the
delay
is
our
fault.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
no.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
one
last
thought
is
that
in
considering
this
stay
order,
i
think
the
court
should
consider
the
reasonableness,
assuming
that
it
was
proper
at
all
in
any
sense
to
issue
a
stay
order
in
such
case.
it
was
clearly
improper
to
do
so
at
the
time
and
to
the
extent
allowed.
it
should
have
been
--
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
that
is
correct
your
honor,
it's
an
indefinite
order.
mr.
louis
fenner
claiborne
it
doesn't.
it
leaves
it
up
to
the
parties
to
wait
100
years.
thank
you.
