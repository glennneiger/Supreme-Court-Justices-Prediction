justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
voldness,
is
it
true
that
this
(inaudible)
by
state
upon
section
290-102?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
if
(inaudible)
doesn't
what
the
statute
says?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
you
(inaudible)
there
is
no
income?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
this
statute
apply
to
one
(inaudible)
doing
some
local
business?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
according
to
the
terms
of
supply
(inaudible)
would
be
barred
exclusively
in
interstate.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
locals.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
i
find
that
clear
in
my
mind
(inaudible)
pursuant
here
under
(inaudible)
which
is
imposed
only
upon
those
who
have
(inaudible)
exclusively
in
interstate
business.
now
it
seems
to
me
your
contention
was
(inaudible)
that
they
were
in
fact
doing
out
of
intrastate
business.
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
if
they
were,
it's
pretty
simple,
i
would
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
beg
pardon.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
are
not
involved
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
involved.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
involved.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assume
(inaudible),
the
statue
picks
up
and
therein
it
says
it
does
not
reach
it
unless
it
is
--
it
consists
exclusively
from
interstate
commerce.
now
that's
what
is
relevant,
because
the
argument
you
are
making
about
transactions
between
a
salesmen
and
a
dealer
and
a
contractor
(inaudible)
which
happens
to
be
close
(inaudible)
had
to
do
with
it,
unless
you
are
indicating
that
tax
meant
local
business?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
not
contend
that
there
was
any
local
business
being
done
by
this
petitioner.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
local
business
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
it
has
to
be
exclusive
(inaudible)
in
your
view
it
has
to
be
income
arising
more
(inaudible)
and
exclusively
from
interstate
business
before
this
statute
of
which
you
derive
reaches
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
would
you
deal
with
it
without
(inaudible)
that
if
this
company
were
doing
any
local
business
(inaudible)
then
it
has
subjected
itself
to
(inaudible).
now
i
am
trying
to
know
what
is
it
you
contend
there
was
any
local
business
done
by
petitioner
in
minnesota,
if
so
then
what
is
that?
if
not
then
your
law
(inaudible)
income
exclusively
from
interstate
business
and
the
fact
(inaudible)
you
have
power
to
do
what
you
did?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there
is
local
difference
in
each
of
these
cases.
that
is
my
point
(inaudible)
incidence
of
taxation
of
local
carriers.
here
it
seems
to
me
you
are
limited
to
a
whole
(inaudible)
tax
which
imposes
a
tax
only
upon
that
which
derives
exclusively
from
interstate
commerce?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
mean
this
tax
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that's
not
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
none
of
this
comes
out
actually
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
general,
is
the
word
is
used
always
(inaudible)
and
its
stock,
resident
then
in
georgia,
how
the
same
tax
with
respect
to
local
business
as
to
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
your
own
supreme
court
dealt
it
was
not
business
(inaudible),
did
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
section
9
(2)
(c)
113?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible),
would
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
–
the
statute
does
