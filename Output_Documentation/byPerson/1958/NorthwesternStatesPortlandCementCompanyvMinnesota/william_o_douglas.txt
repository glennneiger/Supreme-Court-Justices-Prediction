justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
incidence
of
taxes
in
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
spoken
specifically
on
that,
what
the
incidence
is?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
they
didn't
pay
it
would
they
lose
their
license?
are
they
authorized
to
do
business
in
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
they
be
required
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
they
didn't
pay,
could
they
be
out
of
the
state
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
their
sales
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
there
is
no
sanction
inside
the
--
that
minnesota
could
apply
to?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
conceded
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
only
force
that
this
judgment
has
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
before
you
go
there,
then
this
--
what
do
you
say
this
case
would
be
quite
different
than
from
the
spector
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
influence
of
the
tax
in
spector
case
was
only
a
franchise
of
the
corporations?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
relied
upon
by
this
court.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
the
spector
case
if
the
tax
hadn't
been
paid
they
could
have
been
barred
from
crossing
the
state,
their
interstate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
thought
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
it
can't
be
that
they
have
greater
power
by
a
state
to
tax
a
corporation
exclusively
on
interstate
commerce
when
it
doesn't
even
enjoy
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
the
state
then
--
it
doesn't
even
have
that
much
for
the
state.
i
don't
see
why
you
â€“
i
frankly
don't
follow
the
metaphysical
argument,
you
first
have
to
create
--
satisfy
a
due
process
before
you
go
over
to
commerce?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that's
the
holding
often
to
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
still
don't
see
how
this
reaches
the
interstate,
how
this
cripples
these,
interferes
with
the
performance
of
an
interstate
function
if
there
is
no
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
action
that
the
state
of
minnesota
can
take
against
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
able
to
distinguish
the
west
publishing
case
in
california.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
per
curiam
decision
it
seemed
would
be
fairly
simple
case
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that
would
go
to
you
due
process,
would
it
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
not
through
your
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean
on
the
commerce
point
there
is
no
(inaudible).
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
are
saying
the
contractors
made
a
mistake.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
know.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
haven't
made
that
contention.
justice
william
o.
douglas
minnesota
has
never
stopped
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
what
is
--
do
you
have
a
formula
for
apportioning?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
still
don't
see
how
(inaudible)
on
the
facts.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
statute
clearly
makes
that
irrelevant?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
still
don't
get
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
penalty
for
non
payment
of
this
tax?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
suggest
that
the
respondent
should
be
qualified.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
any
aspect
of
double
taxation
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
it
get
a
credit
to
--
what
its
home
state,
alabama?
