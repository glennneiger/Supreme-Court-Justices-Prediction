mr.
john
izard,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
differences
between
my
brother
from
georgia
and
myself
are
really
very
narrow.
i
think
he
has
stated
the
state's
position
candidly.
yesterday
he
stated
the
facts
in
a
great
deal
of
detail
and
generally
speaking
with
fairness.
i
will
only
take
a
minute
to
summarize
the
facts
as
we
say
and
i
point
out
the
significant
factors
in
the
case.
stockham
is
a
delaware
corporation
with
its
principle
place
of
business
in
alabama.
it
maintains
no
inventories
in
georgia.
it
has
no
bank
accounts
there.
all
orders
which
are
received
from
georgia
customers
are
sent
to
the
home
office
in
alabama
for
acceptance
or
rejection
at
that
point.
the
record
shows
that
orders
are
rejected
for
credit
or
for
other
reasons.
all
goods
which
are
shipped
to
georgia
customers
are
shipped
from
warehouses
or
factories
outside
the
state
and
our
shipped
fob
the
factory
or
warehouse,
so
that
under
georgia
law
title
clearly
passes
outside
the
state
of
georgia.
the
record
also
shows
that
most
orders
i
believe
is
what
appears
in
the
record
are
received
by
direct
mail
at
the
company's
home
office.
the
salesman
who
does
spend
--
have
his
office
in
atlanta
and
spend
one-third
of
his
time
in
the
state
of
georgia
carries
on
the
ordinary
and
usual
duties
of
a
salesman.
he
takes
orders
from
customers
that
are
already
on
the
company's
books,
he
seeks
out
new
customers,
he
does
everything
that
a
good
salesman
can
do
to
promote
the
company's
business
and
to
increase
the
interstate
sale
of
its
products.
under
the
georgia
law,
stockham
is
not
required
to
do
business
--
to
qualify
to
do
business
in
georgia.
we
had
it
well
established
by
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
that
a
company
is
not
required
to
qualify
when
all
of
its
activities
are
a
part
of
interstate
commerce.
that
then
is
the
simple
picture
of
stockham's
connection
with
georgia.
it
has
one
sales
representative
who
travels
five
states
in
that
area,
spending
one-third
of
his
time
in
georgia
and
for
his
convenience
there
is
a
sales
office
in
atlanta
with
one
secretary
employed
there.
this
is
nothing
but
the
old
drummer
case
once
again.
it's
exactly
drumming.
it's
nothing
but
drumming.
we've
got
a
man
in
the
modern
day
time
trying
to
sell
the
products
to
a
foreign
corporation
in
interstate
commerce.
the
positioned
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
there
is
no
forfeiture
or
--
of
course
he
is
not
qualified
in
the
first
place
so
they
couldn't
take
that
privilege,
the
states
would
be
--
have
usual
remedies
for
collecting
a
tax,
to
bring
a
suit
or
attachment,
garnishment
or
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
should
have
qualified
no
sir,
that's
i
think
well
settled
under
our
law
that
it
is
not
required
to
do
so.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
it
is
our
view
your
honor
that
if
this
type
of
tax
is
permitted,
it
is
relatively
new
development,
the
type
of
tax
which
georgia
is
seeking
to
impose
here
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
georgia
is
only
state
that
has
tried
to
impose
a
tax
on
stockham
based
on
this
type
of
activity.
so
under
those
circumstances
stockham
itself
is
--
does
not
take
the
position
that
it's
being
taxed
on
more
than
100%
of
its
inocme,
but
we
strenuously
urge
that
if
this
type
of
tax
is
permitted,
it
will
immediately
result
in
more
than
100%
of
the
company's
income
being
taxed.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
in
alabama,
i
think
under
the
--
it's
actually
a
delaware
corporation,
it
is
not
so
with
its
principle
plant,
the
manufacturing
company
in
alabama.
it's
our
position
that
the
domicile
of
the
corporation
alone
will
justify
a
state
in
taxing
all
of
its
net
income
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
then
you've
got
the
further
question
of
how
much
a
commercial
domicile
would
presumably
be
alabama
in
this
case,
what
percentage
they
get
taxed.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
seriously
contented
those
states
together
could
not
tax
at
least
a
100%
of
the
company's
income
if
not
200%
if
they
exhausted
their
power
under
the
constitution.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
does
either
state
--
alabama
does,
delaware
does
not.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir,
and
the
record
shows
that
they
pay
alabama
income
tax.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
that
was
the
manufacturing
company
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
in
georgia,
155
georgia,
in
which
a
foreign
company
had
a
sales
office
in
atlanta
very
similar
to
this
company,
the
facts
were
entirely
analogous
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
that
was
all
interstate
commerce,
and
the
state
had
no
power
either
to
permit
or
deny
the
company
from
doing
business.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes,
it
was
under
the
franchise
tax,
the
georgia
franchise
tax.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yeah
that's
what
qualifying
does
in
georgia,
you
have
to
register
for
the
franchise
tax
is
what
they
told
in
one
form
and
they
say
it
again.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir
–-
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
--
that's
correct.
the
history
of
the
georgia
income
tax
i
might
just
mention
briefly
in
response
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
whitaker
asked
yesterday,
“our
statute
until
1951
imposed
the
income
tax
on
domestic
and
foreign
corporations
doing
business
in
georgia,”
that's
all
that
statute
said.
and
under
that
statute
and
again
under
facts
quite
similar
to
ours
in
the
stockham
case,
in
redwine
versus
dan
river
mills,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
the
maintenance
of
a
sales
office
and
the
operation
of
salesmen
interstate
was
not
doing
business
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
and
almost
simultaneously
in
fact
a
few
days
before
that
decision
the
legislature
amended
our
statute
to
put
in
the
current
definition
of
doing
business,
which
i'd
like
to
read
once
more
so
the
court
can
see
the
grasp
and
what
georgia
is
trying
to
tax
under
these
circumstances.
it
defines
doing
business
as
follows.
it
says
“every
such
corporation,”
referring
to
domestic
and
foreign
corporations,
“shall
be
deemed
to
be
doing
business
within
the
state
if
it
engages
within
the
state
in
any
activities
or
transactions
for
the
purpose
of
financial
profit
or
gain
whether
or
not
such
corporation
qualifies
to
do
business
in
the
state,
and
whether
or
not
it
maintains
an
office
or
place
of
doing
business
within
the
state,
and
whether
or
not
any
such
activity
or
transaction
is
connected
with
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.”
in
short,
it
taxes
every
corporation
that
engages
in
any
activity
for
profit
whether
or
not
it's
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i
think
it's
entirely
so
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
also
look
the
due
process
requirement
too,
but
if
you
looked
at
both
i
quite
agree
with
that.
turning
back
now
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
ruled
unequivocally
that
all
of
the
activities
of
taxpayer
were
intricate
part
of
interstate
commerce,
the
facts
are
down
there,
stipulated
in
the
record
and
there
was
no
trail
in
this,
tried
on
brief
stipulation
of
facts.
this
then
i
think
puts
the
problem
squarely
and
i
think
georgia
has
put
the
problem
squarely.
this
is
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
interstate
commerce
can
be
forced
to
pay
a
net
income
tax
when
admittedly
all
activities
are
a
part
of
that
commerce.
it
is
so
important
in
this
type
of
case
because
this
again
as
i
say
is
the
drummer
situation
and
historically
and
basically
in
this
country
manufacturing
companies
must
send
their
salesmen
abroad
in
order
to
sell
their
goods.
that's
the
usual
pattern
of
business.
it
is
the
only
effective
means
of
distributing
goods
in
this
country.
customarily
and
not
by
any
effort
to
avoid
taxes
or
any
such
reasons
out
of
business
keeps
its
manufacturing
plants
and
its
warehouses
and
its
offices
that
authoritatively
carry
on
the
business
of
the
company
are
localized
in
one,
two
or
three
states.
that's
no
effort
to
avoid
taxes.
it's
just
a
way
businesses
ordinarily
have
carried
on.
we
have
a,
there
is
an
amicus
brief
filed
here
by
the,
the
national
manufacturers
association
showing
a
survey
that
that's
the
typical
pattern.
we
filed
a
supplemental
brief
that
has
some
economic
studies
in
it,
showing
that
the
ordinary
medium,
or
a
small
size
company
has
its
--
most
of
them
have
their
plants
located
in
one
state
and
don't
have
any
other
contact
with
another
state.
and
the
great,
great
majority
of
them
would
only
have
plants,
warehouses
and
offices
which
up
to
now
have
been
felt
to
bring
general
tax
obligations
on
a
company
in
one,
two
or
three
states.
now
those
same
companies
in
order
to
sell
their
products
in
all
likelihood
have
salesmen
in
almost
all
48
states.
so
nowadays
when
companies
stand
to
make
specialized
products,
they
are
very
soon
filled
the
demand
in
their
immediate
state
or
their
immediate
area.
in
order
to
get
compete
they
necessarily
travel
in
all
states
and
if
this
sort
of
activity
is
going
to
--
subjected
to
taxation
in
these
states,
it
means
a
very
marked
change
and
a
very
tremendous
effect
on
american
business.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir
we
would,
i
would
really
concede
that
it
was
subject
to
the
georgian
income
tax
if
we
maintained
the
warehouse
there.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
no
bank
account,
i
don't
think
to
see
--
contents
that
we
engage
in
any
local
activities
and
say
our
court
held
that
we
did
not.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct.
so
we
have
i
think
four
warehouses,
one
is
located
in
alabama,
of
course
they
have
the
product
factory
and
they
had
one
in
california
and
one
is
pennsylvania
i
believe.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
not
only
say
so,
but
have,
the
record
shows
that
we
have
paid
it.
for
example
in
the
state
of
california
we
have
paid
the
california
income
tax
because
we
have
a
warehouse
there
and
have
never
contested
it
and
i
think
we
have
no
ground
to
contest
it.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
now
we
do
have
a,
in
all
of
the
--
just
the
states
where
we
have
nothing
but
the
traveling
salesmen
for
example
the
man
that
travels
out
of
the
atlanta
office,
travels
regularly
in
florida,
north
carolina,
south
carolina,
part
of
kentucky
or
tennessee
i
believe.
so
in
that
state
the
companies
only
contact
would
be
through
the
salesmen
who
travels
regularly
there
as
part
of
his
territory.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir.
i'd
say
if
we
engaged
in
anything
that
could
be
construed
to
be
intrastate
activity
that
you
could
support
a
tax
at
this
time.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
well,
you
got
your
goods
and
products
and
that
sort
of
thing
there.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
with
regard
to
percentage,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
and
i
think
you
could
figure
it
out
from
the
record.
all
apportionment
figures
are
in
there
but
the
company
does
business
in
the
48
states
and
i
think
pretty
much
on
nationwide
basis.
it's
old
well
established
company
and
has
been
selling
these
valves
for
years.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir.
yes
it
ran
high
in
california.
the
three
years
in
question
we
paid
in
california
a
7000
in
one
year,
8000
and
8000,
the
amounts
that
we
paid.
we
also
paid
to
pennsylvania
where
we
had
a
warehouse
3000,
3000
and
4000.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
they
appear
in
the
record
at
page
11
your
honor,
page
11,
and
actually
page
12
i
was
reading
from.
mr.
johnson
pointed
the
question
of
squarely.
he
said
that
georgia
is
unequivocally
taken
the
position
that
they
can
collect
a
net
income
tax
from
a
company,
engaged
solely
in
interstate
commerce.
the
case
which
of
course
everybody
refers
to
is
most
nearly
bearing
on
the
thing
is
the
spector
motor
case
decided
a
number
of
years
ago
and
the
matter
was
raised
as
to
the
exact
significance
of
that
case.
there
are
of
course
striking
similarities
between
the
two
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view.
in
connecticut,
the
court
found
unequivocally
that
spector
was
engaged
in
no
local
activities
and
that
all
of
its
activities
were
interstate
commerce.
the
court
had
sent
the
statute
back
to
be
construed
by
the
court
of
connecticut
and
they
put
long
label
on
it
that
it
was
a
exercise
on
the
franchise
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
the
business
in
connecticut,
i
believe
was
the
language
they
use.
but
except
for
that
label
whatever
all
of
those
words
strung
together
mean
and
i
don't
know
without
an
attempt
to
find
that
many
of
them
in
one
clause,
except
for
that
the
facts
were
the
same.
it
was
measured
the
same.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
there
were
no
sanctions
to
impose
for
connecticut.
in
fact
it
was
collected
just
like
any
other
tax
and
except
for
that
name,
which
if
it
makes
the
difference
is
the
only
difference
that
can
be
between
the
cases.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
identical.
the
court
pointed
out,
i
thought
were
plainly
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
persuasively
it
says
the
incidence
of
the
tax
in
spector
can
be
on
no
local
business
because
there
was
no
local
business
and
we
are
in
exactly
the
same
situation
here.
we
say
that
stockham
does
no
local
business
in
georgia.
it's
being
required
to
pay
the
georgia
income
tax
solely
because
of
the
interstate
commerce,
which
it
does.
and
to
say
that
that
tax
is
not
on
the
commerce,
it
just
goes
into
an
exercising
--
dialectics
and
semantics
as
we
see
it.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
the
spector
case
the
court
went
to
some
lengths
to
disavow
the
latest
victim
along
the
line
that
the
georgia
people
have
relied
on
that,
many
statements
in
the
cases
to
the
effect
of
the
tax
on
interstate
--
net
income
tax
on
interstate
commerce
is
valid.
that's
been
repeated
over
and
over
with
no
particular
significance
to
the
cases
at
hand
ever
since
the
us
glue
company
case.
but
it
is
clearly
dicta
and
everyone
of
its
time
has
been
used
in
every
case
where
it
is
mentioned
the
court
has
already
found
local
activities
which
would
support
the
tax.
and
the
latest
statement
of
that
or
repetition
of
that
dictum
was
in
memphis
gas
company
against
beeler,
and
in
this
spector
case
in
a
footnote
the
court
pointed
out
carefully
that
was
a
dictum
and
it
was
unnecessary
to
the
decision
of
the
beeler
case.
incidentally
the
tax
in
the
memphis
gas
versus
beeler
was
an
excise
on
income
and
i
think
that's
nothing
but
an
income
tax.
excise,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
includes
all
of
these
taxes
which
are
not
property
taxes
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
spector
certainly
indicated
the
disapproval
of
the
court
for
this
type
of
thing.
except
for
that
case
we
don't
take
a
position
if
there
is
any
controlling
authority
here
on
this
point,
and
we
think
that
it
beyond
a
point
it
certainly
has
never
been
absolutely
settled.
we
would
concede
that.
there
is
nothing
that
demands
a
decision.
this
court
must
look
into
thing
practically.
justice
holmes
pointed
that
out,
the
decisions
on
these
questions
are
not
based
on
highly
theoretical
concepts
but
are
based
on
the
practical
application
of
thing.
and
in
order
to
--
we
can
say
very
easily
that
a
net
income
tax
is
indirect
or
up
in
there
but
these
taxes
all
are
direct.
they
got
to
be
paid
and
paying
them
is
really
the
least
of
the
problem.
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
the
domicile
and
the
commercial
domicile
of
the
corporation
can
surely
tax
up
to
a
100%
of
the
corporation's
income
within
constitutional
limitations.
these
taxes
then
are
going
to
be
collected
on
account
of
drumming
activities,
may
well
start
into
the
second
100%
of
the
corporation's
income.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
in
georgia
or
in
alabama,
i
don't
know
sir,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
constitutional
requirement
that
that
be
done.
for
example
we
have
amended
the
georgia
income
tax
so
that
you
can
no
longer
deduct
federal
income
tax,
the
recent
change
is
that.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i
am
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
that.
i
think
it
–
the
record
indicates
that
it
is
a
franchise
tax
measured
by
net
income.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
not
a
warehouse
there,
i
believe
the
record
indicates
that
there
is
a
sales
office
here.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
what
it
indicates
i
am
not
familiar
with
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
it
says
on
different
wording,
it
seems
to
me
that
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
going
to
say,
it
is
that
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i
was
going
to
say
it's
still
not
there
including
from
the
state.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
as
this
particular
company,
no
it
were
not,
but
of
course
i
don't
think
this
court
can
rely
on
the
legislative
brief
that
the
states
may
grant
commerce
under
these
circumstances.
i
certainly
don't
think
there
is
any
constitutional
requirement
that
such
a
deduction
to
be
permitted.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
in
alabama,
i
think
in
alabama
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i
think
alabama
has
an
apportionment
formula
along
the
lines
of
the
georgia
one.
that
really
leads
me
mr.
chief
justice
into
what
i
was
going
to
speak
about
next
is
a
notion
of
how
these
income
taxes
are
collected
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
when
we
say
income
tax
can
be
collected
on
account
of
the
activities
of
the
solicitor
who
may
pass
through
the
state
with
some
regularity.
in
a
unitary
business
there's
no
way
to
say
that
this
man
earned
so
many
dollars,
or
this
particular
portion
of
the
company's
profit
is
attributable
to
his
efforts
within
the
state.
the
only
way
that
it
has
been
found
so
far
to
deal
with
this
problem
is
so
through
these
concepts
of
apportionment
formula.
those
things
have
been
in
use
ever
since
the
income
tax
and
perhaps
before.
all
of
the
old
massachusetts
cases,
alpha
portland,
you
remember
the
case
(inaudible)
had
apportionment
formula.
massachusetts
was
one
of
the
first
to
get
into
this
and
growing
out
of
that
the
states
have
developed
these
various
and
different
factors.
take
the
georgia
one
for
example
and
how
the
tax
on
stockham
has
figured
in
this
case,
they
take
three
predictions.
they
first
of
all
take
the
value
of
the
average,
monthly
value
of
company's
inventory
in
georgia
divide
it
by
the
average
monthly
value
of
inventory
everywhere,
that
gives
them
one
price.
they
then
take
its
payrolls
in
georgia
for
the
year
and
divide
that
by
the
total
payroll
everywhere.
and
then
they
take
the
gross
receipts
from
georgia
customers
and
divide
that
by
the
company's
total
gross
receipts.
those
three
fractions
are
then
averaged,
in
this
particular
case
the
inventory
fraction
was
zero
because
they
maintain
no
inventories
at
all
in
georgia.
the
payroll
fraction
was
de
minimis.
it
was
almost
non
existent
since
all
we
had
was
a
one
third
of
the
salesmen
down
there
one
secretary
as
opposed
to
the
total
payrolls
of
the
clients
selling
everywhere.
and
then
finally
they
took
the
gross
receipts
fraction
which
over
the
years
hovered
in
the
neighborhood
of
2%
just
about
an
average
basis
out
of
the
48
states
about
2%
of
its
sales
went
in
georgia.
and
averaging
those
three
together
they
got
something
a
little
less
that
1%,
and
they
said
1%
of
your
income
was
earned
in
georgia
and
you
have
to
pay
it
there.
now
that's
the
system
that
georgia
uses.
the
other
states,
those
are
incidentally
are
three
more
common
formulas,
but
the
variations
and
differences
between
all
of
the
other
states
are
tremendous.
the
--
some
of
them
use
three
of
those,
some
of
them
used
two
of
them,
some
of
them
put
in
other
things,
manufacturing
costs
is
a
factor
that's
quite
often
used
as
a
apportionment
formula.
new
york
has
got
a
very
odd
one.
i
think
they
put
in
some
of
your
cash
receivables,
somehow
into
one
of
the
fractions.
we
have
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
blue
brief
there,
a
table
from
prentice
hall
showing
the
factors
that
are
in
use
by
the
various
states.
they
have
got
an
x
mark
under
the
three
common
columns
and
then
footnotes
i
think
22
footnotes
showing
the
other
factors
that
are
used.
and
curiously
this
table
in
itself
overly
simplifies
the
thing
because
it
shows
that
the
great
majority
of
states
do
use
the
gross
receipts
formula
which
is
quite
true,
but
there
are
six
recognized
ways
of
determining
where
a
gross
receipt
is
located,
and
the
states
vary
themselves
on
take
one
or
two
of
the
ways,
some
take
a
particular
one
and
those
ways
range
all
the
ways
from
the
manufacturing
states
which
generally
say
that
a
gross
receipt
will
be
allocated
to
the
place
from
which
the
goods
are
shipped
to
georgia
which
is
not
an
industrial
state
but
more
of
the
market
state
which
says
all
goods
shipped
to
georgia
customers
no
matter
where
they
were
manufactured,
no
matter
where
the
sale
was
negotiated,
no
matter
whether
the
sale
had
any
connection
with
the
state,
all
of
those
sales
go
into
the
numerator
by
the
georgia
formula.
and
in
between
those
extremes
you
have
states
that
apply
the
rule
that
the
place
where
the
sale
was
negotiated
allocates
to
its
numerator.
other
states
say
the
office
of
the
salesmen
or
office
out
of
which
the
salesmen
traveled,
will
allocate
it
to
that
location
i
guess
i
have
it
in
one
more.
so
common
ones
and
then
there
are
variations
on
those
that
fit,
so
one
particular
receipt
could
quite
possibly
go
into
six
numerators
in
the
receipt
formula.
the
same
basic
problems
appear
when
you
come
to
a
property
formula.
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago
that
georgia
used
inventory.
that
is
because
we
don't
have
great
manufacturing,
we
do
have
a
lot
of
branch
warehouses
in
georgia.
for
that
reason
we
just
often
distort
that
figure
upward.
much
more
common
is
the
tangible
property
ratio
which
includes
inventories
and
new
plants
and
everything
else
along
with
it.
likewise
when
you
come
to
the
payrolls
there
is
a
chart
set
out
i
believe
that
shows
at
some
stage
include
commissions,
some
include
salaries
of
officers
and
directors.
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
these
formulas
are
all
different,
they
all
vary,
they've
got
no
similarity
to
them.
the
only
trend
that
runs
through
them
is
that
each
state
selects
a
formula
that
tends
to
favor
its
–
bring
as
much
income
as
it
can
and
putting
as
much
burden
on
the
foreign
companies
as
possible,
that's
a
popular
form
of
taxation.
and
there
is
no
way
that
the
courts
can
police
that
sort
of
thing
as
long
as
the
formula
is
reasonable
on
its
face,
which
all
of
these
are,
there
is
nothing
inherently
objectionable
about
them
and
they've
been
before
this
court
and
other
courts
from
time
to
time,
and
the
rule
is
well
established
that
the
tax
payer
has
the
overwhelming
burden
of
showing
a
formula
brings
in
extra
territorial
values.
so
what
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
if
the
small
or
medium
sized
company,
that
up
to
now
has
been
paying
income
taxes
in
one
state,
has
no
great
accounting
department
for
the
record,
ibm
machines
to
figure
this
sort
of
thing
out.
if
it
just
because
its
salesmen
are
going
to
travel
through
the
48
states,
which
they've
always
done.
if
this
got
to
trial,
to
combine
with
48
income
taxes,
all
varied
and
all
different,
compile
the
necessary
information,
that
would
be
required
to
--
merely
to
fill
out
the
return
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
be
a
tremendous
burden
on
commerce
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
going
into
this
is
try
to
describe
the
burden
which
is
really
the
question
here.
i
think
georgia
misconceives
the
point
a
little
when
it
sticks
to
the
highly
technical
impact
of
the
tax
or
just
what
the
incidence
of
it
maybe.
the
question
here
is
whether
this
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
this
court
has
held
over
the
years
that
its
fundamental
problem
is
whether
or
not
burdens
on
interstate
commerce
are
less
or
greater
and
if
it's
a
very
slight
burden,
for
example
in
property
tax
they've
said
that
interest
to
the
state
and
collecting
the
tax
outweighs
the
burden.
but
here
we
think
the
burden
is
very
real,
that
it
is
a
heavy
burden,
and
that
it
far
--
a
small
poultry
manner
revenue
that
could
be
derived
for
the
states
from
this
sort
of
thing
is
far
outweighed
by
the
tremendous
burden
and
trouble
it
would
be
for
the
interstate
business
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
stockham,
well
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i'd
call
stockham
medium
size.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
oh
i
would
guess
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i'd
say
thousands,
yes
i'd
say
thousands,
perhaps
many
thousands.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
i'd
say
yes
--
or
less.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
that
matter
of
activity
or
less.
i
see
no
distinction
between
stockham's
activity
and
another
company
that
may
merely
have
a
salesman
that
travels
regularly
in
georgia.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
would
say
all
of
them
--
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yeah
quite.
i
would
say
that
that's
the
overwhelming
pattern
of
american
business.
i
wouldn't
say
just
seven
states
or
just
northern
states.
i'd
go
further
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
i
don't
--
i
would
go
further
and
based
on
these
studies
that
have
made,
i
call
the
court's
particular
attention
to
the
supplemental
brief
which
we
filed
in,
which
contains
a
study
which
was
made
by
a
leading
economist
(inaudible),
parties
who
interested
in
the
same
made
a
grant
available
and
he
has
made
an
exhaustive
study
and
he
shows
that,
that
has
been
the
pattern
of
american
business
and
that
it's
customary
that
those
companies
have
never
been
called
on
to
pay
taxes
in
more
that
one
or
two
or
three
states.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
they
we
made
by
some
industries
and
trade
associations
who
had
been
concerned
by
the
growing
trend
of
the
states
to
try
to
--
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
professor
paul
studenski
of
new
york
university.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
no
sir,
except
from
the
basic
proposition
that
i
make
under
due
process
that
none
of
it
was
derived
from
georgia
under
that
sense,
but
as
far
as
the
fairness
of
formula
we
do
not
attack
that.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
izard,
jr.
no,
for
example,
i
don't
raise
the
issue
that
inventories
are
an
unfair
way
to
allocate
income
to
georgia
which
is
(inaudible),
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
right
now,
the
time,
just
for
a
moment
to
the
due
process
side
of
this
case,
it's
been
mentioned
a
number
of
times
in
argument
before.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
two
propositions
under
due
process.
you've
got
first
of
all
the
question,
of
whether
or
not
a
company
is
amenable
to
suit
within
a
jurisdiction,
whether
or
not
you've
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
it,
and
this
court
in
the
recent
mcgee
case
has
certainly
gone
long
way
in
saying
that
any
reasonable
connection
with
the
state
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
service
of
process.
but
i
don't
understand
that
the
mcgee
case
purports
to
overrule
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
such
as
the
miller
brothers
case
dealing
with
the
maryland
use
tax.
in
that
case,
you
remember
is
that
there
was
a
department
store
in
wilmington,
selling
furniture
i
believe.
they
are
advertising
and
mail
circulars
were
delivered
to
maryland
customers,
and
customers
from
maryland
frequently
came
over
to
wilmington
and
brought
furniture
at
the
store.
some
of
the
furniture
that
was
purchased
was
shipped
to
the
customers
in
maryland,
but
even
more
than
that
the
store's
delivery
trucks
regularly
transported
this
furniture
to
the
state
of
maryland.
in
that
case,
maryland
tried
to
make
the
wilmington
department
store
an
agent
to
collect
its
use
tax
for,
and
this
court
stuck
the
tax
down
saying,
that,
that
was
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law,
and
that
the
activities
of
that
store
were
not
sufficient,
subjective
to
a
use
tax.
there
the
similarity
between
that
and
this
case,
is
there
you
had
delivery
trucks
going
into
the
state
and
here
we've
a
got
a
salesman
spending
some
time.
that's
probably
--
we've
got
more
slightly
more
activities
than
miller
brothers
case.
on
the
other
hand,
miller
bros.
only
involved
the
use
tax,
which
was
growing
out
of
the
very
transactions
which
brought
this
income
into
the
state.
the
very
thing,
the
use
of
the
goods
was
all
that
was
being
taxed.
in
this
case,
we've
got
a
general,
all
encompassing
income
tax
which
it
being
trying
to
put
on
very
much
the
same
footing.
there
is
an
interesting
decision
of
this
court,
construing
the
income
tax
of
the
philippine
islands,
which
i
think
points
up
the
due
process
issue
awfully
well.
the
philippines
a
number
of
years
ago
had
a
taxing
law
that
taxed
all
income
derived
from
sources
within
the
philippine
islands,
that
was
of
the
language
of
the
taxing
statute,
and
a
philippine
concern
that
their
business
very
much
like
stockham,
it
was
located
in
the
philippines,
it
has
its
factory
there,
it
manufactured
its
goods
there,
and
send
abroad
into
the
united
states,
salesmen
negotiated
orders
and
took
them
and
sent
them
back
for
acceptance,
the
goods
were
then
sent
to
the
united
states.
the
philippine
company
took
the
position
that
some
of
its
income
was
not
earned
from
sources
within
the
philippine
islands.
it
says
some
of
that
income
should
be
attributed
to
the
activities
of
these
salesmen
in
the
united
states
and
this
court
just
stuck
that
aside
immediately
and
said
of
course
nobody
could
seriously
contain
that
income
was
earned
in
the
united
states
under
those
circumstances
and
that's
exactly
what
from
a
due
process,
the
states
up
to
here
is
an
argument
that
they
are
earning
income,
because
one
man
spends
one-third
of
his
time
in
georgia,
and
they
have
just
a
sales
office
there
for
convenience,
to
say
that
they
really
are
earning
income
from
georgia,
within
the
due
process
concept.
i
think
that
border
concept
is
all
the
more
important,
when
you
consider
the
all
pervasive
nature
of
the
tax.
i
think
it
distinguishes
a
used
tax
which
has
been
upheld
under
similar
circumstances
or
the
tax
in
international
shoe
company
where
it
was
a
tax
on
the
various
salaries
which
the
employee
earned
in
the
state,
as
something
tangible
that
the
state
can
put
its
hands
on.
fundamentally
our
position
comes
back
to
the
question
of
weighing
the
interest
of
the
states
against
the
interest
of
interstate
business.
surely
the
old
adage
that
interstate
commerce
must
pay
its
way,
as
validity
there
is
no
question
(inaudible),
commerce
or
at
least
the
business
that
are
carrying
on
commerce,
we
got
to
pay
the
way
on
the
states
to
which
they
are
reasonably
subjected
to
paying
that
way.
and
the
thing
that
this
court
must
weigh
is
whether
or
not
the
burden
that
georgia
wants
to
put
on
these
salesmen,
based
on
this
slight
connection
with
the
state,
whether
that
burden
and
this
tended
revenue
to
georgia
is
more
important
to
it
than
--
or
i've
tried
to
outline
the
tremendous
burden
and
confusion
and
difficulty
would
be
created,
if
this
court
was
permit
a
tax
based
solely
on
interstate
commerce.
so
far
as
i
know,
the
court
has
never
held
that
exclusively
interstate
commerce
is
subject
to
any
form
of
taxation,
except
on
local
incidence,
which
can
be
carved
out
from
that
commerce.
and
that
is
the
thing
that
up
to
now
has
protected
business
which
sends
its
goods
into
a
great
many
states.
that
is
what
has
protected
it
from
or
terribly
complicated
and
an
overpowering
taxation
by
all
of
the
48
states.
certainly
there
hasn't
been
that
leniency
or
desirability
to
favor
the
foreign
company.
drummers
have
been
the
subject
of
discriminatory
taxation
ever
since
the
commerce
clause
was
first
developed
by
this
court.
it's
a
consistent,
attractive,
fundamentally
popular
thing
to
do,
to
put
the
tax
on
the
foreign
corporation
if
you
can
and
here
we've
got
it
again.
we
got
nothing
but
drumming
taking
place
in
georgia,
we've
got
the
drummer
there
again.
we've
got
a
highly
complicated
formula
whereby
they
calculate
the
tax,
but
i
don't
see
how
we
can
escape
the
proposition,
that
georgia
is
seeking
to
tax
this
man
or
this
company,
solely
because
it
does
interstate
commerce
in
the
state.
and
that
is
fundamentally
a
tax
on
commerce
and
that
is
the
sort
of
tax
that
we
respectfully
submit
is
barred
by
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
