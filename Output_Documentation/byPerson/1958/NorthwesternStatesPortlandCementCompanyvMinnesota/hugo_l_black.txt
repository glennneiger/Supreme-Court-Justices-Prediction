justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
has
materiality
in
connection
with
the
question
of
constitutional
question
you
raise
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
a
question
of
state
interpretation
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
to
see
if
i
can
get
this
clear,
i'm
not
sure,
you
have
an
income
tax
in
minnesota.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
written
up
in
a
such
way
that
one
part
it
says
it
shall
apply
to
this
one,
and
another
part
of
it
says
it
shall
apply
to
this
one,
and
another
part
of
it
says
it
should
apply
to
this
one,
that
third
part
is
the
interstate
commerce.
you
are
going
on
the
theory
the
constitution
does
not
forbid
taxation
of
companies
that
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
as
i
gather,
what
you
are
saying
is,
whether
right
or
wrong,
what
you're
arguing
i
want
to
see
if
it
is
right
that
this
interstate
--
these
companies
that
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
are
engaged
--
part
of
their
activities
are
in
your
state,
people
buy
it
there,
whether
it's
(inaudible),
it's
shipped
in
there,
some
of
it
goes
through
local
merchants
as
a
convenience,
and
you
are
attempting
to
tax
the
net
income
on
their
receipts.
now
what
receipts,
i
want
to
get
that,
what
receipts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
from
what
you
say
you
are
--
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong,
you
are
saying
that
while
this
phase
of
this
tax
law,
this
part
of
this
paragraph
refers
to
income
from
interstate
commerce,
that's
just
one
designation
of
a
part
of
the
various
types
of
income
that
you
consider
taxable
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
finally
have
to
get
back
to
the
question,
is
whether
that's
a
forbidden
tax
either
under
the
commerce
clause
or
the
due
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
his
argument
that
minnesota
could
have
equalized
the
burden
on
residents
and
non-residents
by
putting
this
as
a
use
tax
instead
of
an
income
tax?
i
understood
him
to
make
that
argument,
if
you
could
have
done
it
on
a
used
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
company
has
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
company
has
an
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
the
brief
you
are
going
to
give
us,
i
would
like
to
maybe
bear
particular
in
mind
the
statement
of
what
the
northwestern
was
doing
when
you
prepared
it
and
i
want
to
ask
you
now
if
it
was
doing
--
the
company
here
was
doing
these
same
things
in
minnesota,
where
corporation
that
promote
local
trade
and
product,
manufactured
in
another
state,
and
sold
in
interstate
commerce
to
wholesalers,
maintained
their
local
office
with
agents
who
solicited
orders
from
local
retailers
and
turned
them
over
to
local
wholesalers
who
billed
them
and
were
paid
by
the
retailer,
the
court
held
that
was
taxable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
think
is
identical
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
--
what
you
are
going
to
prepare
the
brief
on,
that
statement
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
would
be
a
crucial
difference
(inaudible)
that
paper
was
signed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
fair
appraisal
of
what
you
are
arguing,
i
was
just
wondering.
to
say
that
(inaudible)
that
a
state
has
a
right
to
levy
an
income
tax
on
receipts
by
a
person
out
of
corporation
even
though
those
money
receipts
came
exclusively
from
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
--
i
said
net,
if
i
didn't
say
net
i
meant
net.
justice
hugo
l.
black
net
income.
justice
hugo
l.
black
net
income
from
receipts
derived
exclusively
from
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i
should
amend
the
statement
i
made
by
stating
your
argument,
is
your
argument
that
the
net
income
due
to
receipts
received
exclusively
from
interstate
commerce
is
not
barred
by
the
constitution
merely
because
it
is
derived
exclusively
from
instate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
thought
that
georgia
is
only
the
state
to
impose
an
income
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alabama
does
on
the
stock.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
you
pay
your
taxes
in
the
district
of
columbia
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
that
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
there
is
any
challenge
here
to
what
georgia
has
done
on
the
ground
that
they
have
attempted
to
tax
more
of
the
net
income
stockham
that
was
derived
from
the
state
of
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
legally
speaking
you
say
you
are
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
challenging
that
assessment
that
they
have
only
taxed
such
proportion
of
the
net
income
which
was
derived
from
the
state.
