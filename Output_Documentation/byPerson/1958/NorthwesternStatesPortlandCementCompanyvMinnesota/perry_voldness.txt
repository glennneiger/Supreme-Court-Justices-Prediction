mr.
perry
voldness
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
issues
have
been
stated
by
counsel
for
a
appellant,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
few
items
of
fact
that
i
think
bear
some
stressing.
the
corporation
concern
here
is
in
the
state
of
minnesota
concededly
for
one
purpose,
to
make
money.
its
activity
is
selling
cement
manufactured
in
iowa
to
persons
who
buy
the
cement
in
minnesota.
although
these
activities
are
all
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce,
some
of
these
activities
are
something
more
than
that
are
outside
of
the
usual
idea
of
the
flow
of
commerce.
the
corporation
has
salesmen
who
in
addition
to
soliciting
orders
from
perspective
purchasers
from
the
corporation
contact
the
ultimate
users
of
the
product,
architects
those
people
who
will
be
buying
the
product
that
cannot
buy
from
the
corporation
and
they
quote
to
these
people,
pricing
in
the
same
manner
that
they
quote
to
the
dealers.
they're
driving
for
one
thing
of
course,
to
enlarge
the
volume
of
their
business
that
is
by
encouraging
sales
by
their
dealers
who
handle
the
products.
this
is
specifically
the
sort
of
activity
which
in
northwestern
milling
consolidated
corporation,
northwestern
consolidated
milling
corporation
versus
massachusetts
reported
in
cheney
brothers
company
versus
massachusetts
was
held
sufficient
to
sustain
a
tax
and
the
privilege
of
doing
a
local
business.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
tax
is
sort
to
be
rested
under
the
provisions
of
290.03.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
state
court
if
i
might
point
out,
construed
the
tax
as
a
purely
general
net
income
tax,
which
was
not
by
operative
effect,
legislative
intent
or
dictionary
definition,
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
some
of
this
confusion
--
mr.
perry
voldness
the
section
applies
also
to
residents,
non-residents,
the
estates
of
decedents
and
to
trusts.
the
court
--
mr.
perry
voldness
no.
mr.
perry
voldness
i
think
the
distinction
that
i
would
make
there
is
that
under
the
provisions
of
290.02
a
tax
is
imposed
upon
corporations
doing
a
local
business
for
the
privilege
of
doing
that
business.
290.03
imposes
a
tax
on
residents,
on
non-residents,
on
trusts,
states
of
decedents
and
on
those
corporations
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
who
are
not
taxable
under
290.02.
if
this
nomenclature
second
structure
is
to
be
applied,
i
think
the
second
structure
tax
is
the
tax
imposed
upon
the
local
business.
then
in
that
sense
we
impose
a
--
if
you
want
to
call
a
subject
to
the
tax
is
the
privilege
in
lieu
of
the
income
tax
imposed
under
290.03.
now
with
respect
to
--
mr.
perry
voldness
i
would
--
i
cite
the
cheney
brothers
case
for
this
proposition
if
--
mr.
perry
voldness
the
cheney
brothers
--
mr.
perry
voldness
in
the
cheney
brothers
case,
the
tax
on
seven
corporations,
there
was
--
tax
on
seven
different
corporations
was
under
consideration.
with
respect
to
northwestern
consolidated
milling
corporation,
the
minnesota
corporation
was
operating
in
massachusetts
under
substantially
the
same
set
of
facts
here,
except
--
mr.
perry
voldness
--
they
had
salesmen
in
the
state
who
solicited
orders.
mr.
perry
voldness
from
wholesalers
and
in
addition
they
solicited
orders
from
local
people
and
delivered
it
to
the
wholesalers
through
which
they
sold
their
products.
mr.
perry
voldness
in
this
case.
mr.
perry
voldness
in
this
case
the
salesmen
of
the
appellant,
contact
as
a
regular
course
of
business
those
persons
who
are
the
ultimate
users
of
the
cement,
but
whom
the
corporation
would
not
sell,
the
corporation
considers
eligible
dealers
or
eligible
purchasers
only
lumber
yards,
building
supply
dealers,
contractors
and
ready
mix
cement
companies.
mr.
perry
voldness
i
can
--
mr.
perry
voldness
there
is
and
i
will
give
you
an
exact
reference.
in
fact
if
you
would
examine
the
record
at
page
86
the
testimony
of
mr.
pray,
witness
of
--
mr.
perry
voldness
86.
we
have
a
reference
there,
the
contract
between
the
seller
as
the
dealer
who
handles
the
product,
who
purchases
from
northwestern
and
the
person
to
whom
he
sells
the
product,
a
reference
to
exhibit
20
which
is
recorded
at
page
--
record
336,
we
also
have
testimony
--
mr.
perry
voldness
336.
mr.
perry
voldness
of
the
fine
print
in
the
contract
is
of
course
is
merely
an
agreement
with
regard
to
the
quantity
used,
price
and
shipment
of
the
cement,
but
as
the
testimony
on
page
86
shows,
this
was
drawn
up
for
use
by
the
dealer
in
dealing
with
the
person,
the
ultimate
consumer
of
the
cement.
it
is
to
be
signed
by
according
to
the
exhibit
would
appear
by
two
persons,
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
pray
signed
by
all
three
partners.
mr.
perry
voldness
i
don't
know
where
that
contract
was
made.
mr.
perry
voldness
i
am
just
pointing
up
an
analogy,
is
what
i
have
been
attempting
to
do
here.
also
there
is
a
testimony
in
the
record
that
in
order
to
increase
the
business
of
the
corporation,
these
contacts
with,
shall
we
say
non,
the
non-direct
purchasers,
that
is
with
the
ultimate
consumers,
was
such
as
to
require
a
special
form
for
holding
prices
to
it.
and
that
is
again
on
page
--
record
79,
the
question
was,
“now
mr.
pray
showing
you
the
defendant's
exhibit
17,
i
will
ask
you
to
identify
it,
if
you
can
do
so
and
tell
the
court
what
it
is?”
“this
is
a
quotation
on
specific
work,
a
work
that
can
be
identified
like
a
bar
nor
a
bank
building
or
a
library
or
a
bridge.
it
is
initially
used
in
quoting
for
the
account
of
the
dealer.”
“what
do
you
mean
by
that?”
answer,
“i
mean
by
that
that
the
cement
is
going
to
go
through
the
dealer
and
the
dealer
informs
us
as
to
what
price
he
wants
to
sell
that
cement
for
and
that
is
the
price
we
quote
to
the
contractor
who
is
figuring
this
work.”
“who
is
this
sent
to?”
at
record
page
80,
“that
form
would
be
sent
to
a
contractor.”
now
i
point
out
the
cheney
case
and
the
decision
therein
with
regard
to
the
northwestern
consolidated
milling
company
to
point
out
that
a
situation
analogous
to
this
was
sufficient
to
sustain
a
tax
from
the
doing
of
a
local
business.
but
we
do
not
contend
that
the
tax
here,
we
reject
any
contention
that
the
tax
here
is
imposed
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
our
court
held
this
was
general
net
income
tax
and
that
it
was
a
not
a
franchise
tax,
it
was
not
a
privilege
tax.
it
is
imposed
clearly
and
simply
on
net
income
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
i
think
will
bear
me
out
when
i
say
the
tax
on
net
income
is
not
a
tax
on
the
source
of
net
income
as
was
pointed
out
in
peck
&
company
versus
lowe,
and
the
us
glue
versus
of
town
of
oak
creek.
here
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
--
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
the
net
income,
if
you
will.
true
this
may
arise
out
of
activities
conducted
within
the
state.
leaving
the
nature
of
the
tax
aside
--
mr.
perry
voldness
the
tax
is
imposed
on
all.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
tax
is
imposed
on
all
that
is
a
net
income
tax.
in
the
case
of
290.02
however
the
imposition
is
a
privilege
tax
or
(inaudible).
that
--
that
applies
only
to
corporations
that
are
doing
a
local
business
or
you
might
say
i'll
let
me
read
this
statute
that
would
be
best.
“290.02,
imposition
of
privilege
tax
on
corporations
measurement,
an
annual
exercise
tax
is
hereby
imposed
upon
every
domestic
corporation
except
those
included
within
section
290.03
for
the
privilege
of
existing
as
a
corporation
during
any
part
of
the
taxable
year
and
upon
every
foreign
corporation
except
those
included
within
290.03
for
the
draft
to
it
of
the
privilege
of
transacting
or
for
the
actual
transaction
by
it
of
any
local
business
within
the
state
doing
any
part
of
its
taxable
year
in
corporate
or
organized
form.
under
290.03
an
annual
tax
for
each
taxable
year,
computed
in
the
manner
and
at
the
rates
hereinafter
provided
is
hereby
imposed
upon
the
taxable
net
income
for
such
year
of
the
following
classes
of
taxpayers”
and
it
names
four
classes
of
tax
payers.
“domestic
corporations
not
taxable
under
290.02
--”
mr.
perry
voldness
that's
right,
resident
and
non-resident
individuals
--
mr.
perry
voldness
--
estates
of
decedents
--
mr.
perry
voldness
--
and
trusts.
now
when
we
look
to
the
statute
to
determine
the
subject
of
the
tax,
it
is
clear
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
net
income.
the
fact
that
a
related
tax
of
equal
weight,
of
equal
measure,
of
equal
burden
is
imposed
upon
the
domestic
corporation
should
be
sufficient
to
destroy
any
argument
that
the
tax
imposes
an
unfair
burden
or
discriminates
against
the
foreign
corporation.
mr.
perry
voldness
that's
right.
mr.
perry
voldness
my
argument
is
that
you
have
to
construe
the
statute
from
the
four
corners
to
determine
what
is
the
subject
of
the
tax?
the
subheadings
with
regard
to
corporations
with
regard
to
residents
and
non-residents
are
only
denoting
who
is
subject
to
the
tax.
mr.
perry
voldness
it's
immaterial
from
the
commerce
clause,
from
the
commerce
clause
portion
of
the
argument
which
is
hard
to
separate,
because
as
long
as
the
local
corporation
that
is
the
domestic
or
the
intrastate
corporation
is
being
subjected
to
the
same
burden
there
is
no
discrimination.
mr.
perry
voldness
they
have
made
classifications
i
think
for
this
purpose
for
classifying
or
to
pointing
out
in
this
case
we
are
taxing
the
income
from
interstate
commerce.
if
he
is
a
non-resident
or
the
resident
we
are
taxing
income
from
an
entirely
different
source.
source
is
of
material
insofar
as
the
subject
is
concerned.
mr.
perry
voldness
well
this
would
be
the
case
in
all
of
our
railroad
cases
where
we
impose
a
personal
property
tax
on
railroad
cars,
apportioned
to
the
allocated
sales,
the
amount
of
time
spent
within
interstate.
the
amount
paid
for
that
tax
comes
from
interstate.
mr.
perry
voldness
by
analogy,
the
income
tax
also
taxes
the
apportioned
net
income,
attributable
to
activities
within
the
state
which
benefit
from
the
governmental
services,
which
have
been
rendered.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
state
of
minnesota
--
the
state
supreme
court
has
construed
this
statute,
and
i
do
not
think
that
they
have
done
any
injustice
to
the
legislative
intent.
i
think
the
language
is
clear
on
its
face.
it
is
hereby
to
propose
a
tax
on
net
income.
mr.
perry
voldness
well
i'm
talking
about
--
in
that
case
i'm
talking
about
activities
in
the
due
process
sense.
mr.
perry
voldness
well
i
would
contend
that
the
activity
of
contacting
those
to
whom
he
would
not
sell,
that
is
in
largely
the
business
of
the
lumberyard
dealers
--
mr.
perry
voldness
--
is
the
local
activity.
mr.
perry
voldness
but
i
would
also
admit
that,
that
is
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce,
because
he
wouldn't
have
been
engaging
in
it
unless
it
paid
off.
mr.
perry
voldness
perhaps.
mr.
perry
voldness
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is
to
that.
mr.
perry
voldness
we
haven't
made
that
contention,
we
haven't
advanced
it.
mr.
perry
voldness
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
perry
voldness
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
does.
i
would
say
that
it's
merely
an
attempt
to
group
them.
a
resident
maybe
(inaudible)
no
interstate
business
and
he
is
taxed,
a
non
resident
is
taxed
--
mr.
perry
voldness
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
--
the
court
has
held
that
the
income
was
exclusively
from
interstate
business,
but
its
activities
were
all
an
integral
part
of
interstate
business.
now,
some
of
these
activities
maybe
outside
the
direct
flow
of
commerce
in
the
general
sense,
but
they
were
still
an
integral
part
of
the
interstate
business.
the
income
was
derived
solely
from
the
interstate
commerce.
the
question
in
that
remains
is
whether
net
income
is
a
subject
of
tax
which
will
sustain
this,
which
will
sustain
the
tax
against
an
argument
that
it
violates
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
net
income
--
mr.
perry
voldness
that
is
right.
when
we
speak
of
net
income
we
intend
to
only
tax
that
net
income
which
is
fairly
attributable
to
the
activities
that
arise
out
of
the
minnesota
activity
--
mr.
perry
voldness
--
or
conducted
within
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
perry
voldness
now
this
is
a
due
process.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
income.
the
income
--
mr.
perry
voldness
i
would
say
that
it
arise
exclusively
from
the
interstate
commerce,
the
activities
of
interstate
commerce
that
are
attributed
to
minnesota.
certain
activities
are
carried
out
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
you
cannot
say
that
they
weren't
carried
on
there.
they
were
carried
on
in
the
state.
the
question
is
whether
the
tax
in
operation
is
operated
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
mr.
perry
voldness
a
license
tax
on
drummers?
mr.
perry
voldness
under
the
spector,
the
answer
–
mr.
perry
voldness
under
the
theory
of
the
spector
case
the
answer
no
because
there
is
no
right
in
the
state
to
impose
an
privilege,
any
tax
on
--
directly
on
the
--
mr.
perry
voldness
i
think
that,
that
has
been
answered
by
this
court
in
pekin
company
versus
law.
mr.
perry
voldness
i
think
that,
that
is
by
this
court
in
pekin
company
versus
law,
where
it
was
held
that
a
tax
on
income
was
not
a
tax
on
the
source
of
the
income.
the
tax
of
the
appellant
--
mr.
perry
voldness
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
yes.
mr.
perry
voldness
that's
my
position.
mr.
perry
voldness
now
the
attempt
to
bring
the
interstate
commerce
question
over
into
due
process
has
i
think
been
rejected
by
this
court
before,
in
international
harvester
company
versus
kentucky,
the
court
indicated
and
rejected
an
argument
that
the
interstate
--
the
fact
that
the
activities
were
entirely
interstate
commerce
is
embodied
those
activities
such
that
it
should
eliminate
the
corporation
from
service
of
process.
and
i
know
the
argument
is
made
that
what
is
sufficient
for
service
of
process
is
not
perhaps
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
a
tax,
but
in
international
shoe
company
versus
washington,
the
rule
is
clearly
laid
out
that
if
the
activities
which
are
substantially
the
same
as
in
this
case,
were
sufficient
to
sustain
both
the
lawsuit
and
the
tax
under
the
due
process.
now
west
publishing
company
versus
mccolgan
follows
this
same
line
of
reasoning
and
it
is
my
position
that
west
publishing
company
versus
mccolgan
actually
controls
this
case.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
california
income
tax
like
minnesota
is
purely
a
general
net
income
tax.
mr.
perry
voldness
that's
correct.
mr.
perry
voldness
on
net
income
from
those
that
this
fairly
attributable
under
a
three
factor
apportionment
formula
to
the
activities
conducted
within
the
state
of
minnesota,
there
has
been
no
question
with
regard
to
the
fairness
of
the
formula.
mr.
perry
voldness
that
is
correct.
mr.
perry
voldness
that
is
the
question.
mr.
perry
voldness
after
the
hearing
is
adjourned?
mr.
perry
voldness
(inaudible)
mr.
perry
voldness
then
assuming
at
least
for
the
purpose
that
the
tax
satisfies
due
process,
we
know
that
there
are
several
constitutional
tests
that
must
be
met
with
regard
to
the
constitution.
is
there
discrimination?
there
has
been
none
in
fact
here,
none
has
been
shown,
none
has
been
alleged.
domestic
corporations
insofar
as
the
ultimate
tax
burden
is
concerned
are
no
better
off
than
this
corporation.
those
corporations
which
engage
in
intrastate
commerce
alone
are
no
better
off
than
this
corporation,
but
to
sustain
the
appellant's
contention
and
hold
them
tax
free,
would
mean
that
the
discrimination
would
be
placed
under
domestic
corporation
or
the
corporation
engaging
in
intrastate
business,
because
a
lot
of
our
corporations
may
not
go
outside
the
state,
but
they
would
have
to
pay
a
tax,
they
would
have
to
pay
the
cost
for
the
services
of
government
that
this
appellant
receives.
now
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
an
income
tax,
but
i
think
that
everyone
agrees
the
basically
it's
the
most
equitable,
the
fairest
form
of
taxation
there
is.
it's
the
only
tax
that
i
know
of
that
is
clearly
based
on
ability
to
pay.
perhaps
it
could
be
even
phrased
in
a
better
manner.
it
could
be
drawn
so
that
it
would
more
clearly
reflect
the
ability
of
payer.
when
we
look
at
the
taxes
we
are
familiar
with,
this
one
is
designed
to
do
one
thing,
to
tax
people
on
the
ability
to
pay
and
i
say
there
is
one
other
thing
that
it
does,
it
relates
the
benefits,
protections,
the
opportunities
and
further
afforded
by
government
to
something
that
we
already
recognize,
dollar
value.
now
what
better
criteria
for
the
value
of
the
services
received
by
this
corporation
than
police
protection,
fire
protection,
the
production
or
the
presentation
of
a
civilized
market
tender,
even
the
net
income
of
the
corporation.
counsel
for
appellant
has
argued
that
after
all
the
state
of
minnesota
must
furnish
this
civilized
community
and
this
market.minnesota
does
not
have
to
furnish
a
market.
minnesota
just
cannot
keep
the
corporation
from
coming
in
there,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
corporation
should
be
free
to
come
in
and
to
be
in
plain
words
a
freeloader.
mr.
perry
voldness
well
on
a
used
tax
of
course
--
i
don't
think
that
the
used
tax
will
conceivably
reach
the
same
fairness
of
result
in
the
first
place.
a
used
tax
isn't
related
to
ability
to
pay.
it
isn't
related
to
the
value
of
the
services
received.
it's
a
flat
levy
on
each
transaction.
mr.
perry
voldness
our
tax,
the
tax
that
we
have
here
falls
on
our
own
residents
in
practical
operation
and
effect.
mr.
perry
voldness
well
the
--
we
have
an
income
tax
in
minnesota
yes.
mr.
perry
voldness
this
specific
section,
no
but
under
290.02
we
also
impose
an
income
tax.
mr.
perry
voldness
i
might
point
out
that
the
incidents
--
mr.
perry
voldness
the
legal
subject
of
the
tax
in
290.02
has
never
been
precisely
pointed
out
by
our
court.
in
191
--
in
reid
versus
bjornson,
this
is
not
cited
in
my
brief,
in
reid
versus
bjornson,
191
minnesota,
i
think
at
page
254,
the
court
points
out
that
this
maybe
a
property
tax,
it
may
not,
they
never
went
on
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
it
was
an
exercise
tax
or
a
property
tax.
there
have
been
no
decisions
with
regards
to
our
tax
except
this
case
construing
290.03
to
be
not
a
privilege
tax.
now
with
respect
to
multiplicity
of
burden,
any
idea
that
perhaps
the
taxpayer
is
going
to
be
taxed
on
more
than
100%
of
his
income.
in
the
first
place
due
process
requires
in
order
to
avoid
reaching
extraterritorial
value
that
there
be
an
apportionment
with
respect
to
property,
that
the
apportionment
be
according
to
situs,
with
respect
to
net
income
that
the
same
thing
should
apply,
that
there
should
be
an
apportionment
according
to
the
source
of
the
income
and
this
is
a
question
of
fact
whether
the
formula
in
fairness
does
attribute
to
the
state
be
proper
law.
now
the
taxpayer
can
come
in
and
show
that
it
does
not
tax
in
that
manner.
he
is
entitled
to
separate
accounting
and
separate
accounting
will
correctly
equate,
reflect
and
this
formula
will
not.
now
with
respect
to
the
state
of
domicile,
the
court
has
imposed
a
rule
on
these
states
that
personal
property
must
be
apportioned
if
situs
is
shown
elsewhere.
this
same
principle
can
be
used
to
prevent
multiple
burdens
or
a
duplicity
of
taxation
with
regard
to
the
same
parts
of
the
income,
that
is,
of
income
then
would
not
be
taxed
in
both
iowa
and
minnesota
or
michigan
or
minnesota.
now
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
interstate
commerce
must
pay
it's
own
way,
as
i've
stated
this
tax
is
an
income
tax,
is
fair,
is
equitable,
the
kind
of
thing.
mr.
perry
voldness
it
must
pay
i
think
for
the
benefits,
the
opportunities
that
it
receives.
now
if
i
had
no
--
mr.
perry
voldness
it
may
receive
police
protection
--
mr.
perry
voldness
it
received
police
protection.
mr.
perry
voldness
for
their
drummers.
mr.
perry
voldness
well
i
would
distinguish
the
drummer
cases,
most
of
the
drummer
cases,
but
there
a
flat
license
fee
has
been
imposed
and
that
might
not
their
relationship.
mr.
perry
voldness
for
the
time
that
they
are
in
the
state.
mr.
perry
voldness
well
i
really
couldn't
make
--
mr.
perry
voldness
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
perry
voldness
with
respect
to
west
publishing
company
a
thorough
opinion
of
course
as
i
stated,
before
--
but
the
activities
in
this
case,
although
not
precisely
the
same,
are
as
great
in
scope
as
the
activities
in
west
publishing.
the
only
distinction
that
i
can
see
between
the
two
is
that
instead
of
renting
an
office
and
paying
for
it
in
cash,
they
let
someone
use
their
books.
mr.
perry
voldness
in
west
publishing
company
as
i
understand
the
salesmen
let
lawyers
use
the
books
that
were
being
sold
in
order
--
in
return
for
some
space
in
the
office.
well,
in
our
case
we
have
an
office
that
has
been
maintain
under
lease,
cash
is
paid
for
it
also
maintained
--
mr.
perry
voldness
in
minneapolis.
mr.
perry
voldness
pardon?
mr.
perry
voldness
the
company
has
an
office
that's
listed
in
the
classified
directory
of
the
st.
paul
telephone
book
and
in
the
classified
directory
of
the
minneapolis
book
in
the
alphabetical
section
of
both
books,
it
pays
an
extra
cost
for
the
listing
in
the
same
book,
although
the
minneapolis
listing
comes
with
the
--
mr.
perry
voldness
i
think
that's
--
mr.
perry
voldness
our
court
has
pointed
this
out,
in
fact
the
minnesota
court
points
to
the
change.
mr.
perry
voldness
the
statement
of
facts.
