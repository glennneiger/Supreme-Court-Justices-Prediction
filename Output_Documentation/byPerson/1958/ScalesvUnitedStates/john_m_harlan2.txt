justice
john
m.
harlan
were
those
cases
had
been
tried?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
give
me
the
portion
of
the
judge's
charge
on
that
result?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
all
the
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
incitement
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask,
mr.
taylor
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
these
records
represent
at
the
excerpts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
naked
membership
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
question
please.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
referred
to
government's
earlier
indictment.
has
there
been
any
cases
constituted
without
the
presence
of
the
element
and
intent
or
are
you
simply
referring
to
indictments
that
have
been
filed
and
not
to
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
help
me
out
in
a
mechanical
manner?
you
referred
to
a
government
supplemental
brief
on
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
argument.
all
i've
got
is
this
brief
--
brief
of
the
united
stated
on
reargument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
another
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
realize
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there's
no
other
document
other
than
this
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
have
some
recollection
that
there
was.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
the
trial
was
little
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
argue
it
in
both
bases
therein.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
meat
of
your
argument
that
this
isn't
any
indictment.
they
say
it
can
be
treated
as
an
ingredient
of
membership.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
answer
to
that
is
that
if
that's
the
case,
then
it
isn't
enough
activity
to
make
the
constitutional
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
elaborate
that?
i
don't
quite
understand
why
that's
so.
why
that's
necessarily
--
why
that's
necessary
an
answer
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
it's
possible
that
the
court
gave
an
over
abundant
charge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
--
wouldn't
you
have
to
prove
something
more
under
(a)
in
mere
membership?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
are
arguing
that
their
construction
is
accepted,
you
have
to
read
(a)
out
of
the
picture?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there
isn't
any
membership
provision
in
section
(a).
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
section
17
printed
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
did
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
find
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
it's
in
the
communist
party
case
but
i
didn't
want
to
go
to
that
pile
of
stuff.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
got
it
in
the
next
case
(voice
overlap)
[laughter].
justice
john
m.
harlan
you'd
have
to
say
--
to
say
that
they
are,
with
their
purpose,
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
arguing
the
merits
(inaudible)
but
so
far
as
obviating
a
claim
based
on
that
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
statute,
they
didn't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
they
didn't
do
a
very
good
job,
are
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
suppose
inadvertently,
if
you
will,
(inaudible)
attention
to
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
it
repealed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
all
in
the
context
of
the
conspiracy
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
saying,
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
you
are
saying,
i
take
it
is,
is
without
the
element
activity
of
some
kind,
membership
plus
purpose
adds
up
to
little
more
than
moral
support,
clearly
whether
moral
support
is
constitutionally
reachable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
more
peculiar
to
membership?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
your
--
is
your
definition
of
activity
that
it
has
to
be
something
that's
in
the
purview
of
illegal
purposes
of
the
organization?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
think
it
was
to
--
to
a
certain
degree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
don't
see
why
the
activity
that
justice
black
put
you
isn't
the
activity
that
meets
your
requirement.
