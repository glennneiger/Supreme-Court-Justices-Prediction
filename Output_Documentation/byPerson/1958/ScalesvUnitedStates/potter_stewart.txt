justice
potter
stewart
mr.
taylor,
was
it
alleged
that
--
that
the
petitioner
wrote
any
of
this
material
on
pages
a18
to
21
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
merely
that
he
distributed
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
act
of
1950?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
vantage
of
that
evidence?
how
far
up
do
you
go?
justice
potter
stewart
we
will
ask
you
a
general
question.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
witnesses
were
there
in
this
case
that
gave
what
you
consider
to
be
significant
testimony
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
who
were
not
called
in
the
yates
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
yates
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
remember
it,
there
wasn't
a
single
witness
called
by
the
government,
except
the
isolated
instances
that
the
government
put
what
you
call
the
so-called
theory.
justice
potter
stewart
our
recollection
is
that
lochner
did
not
testify
in
the
yates
case.
justice
potter
stewart
what
meaning
do
you
give
to
the
phrase
"per
se"
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
telling
us
that
it's
really
redundant
that
it's
simply
restating
the
existing
criminal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
trial
court's
instructions
in
this
specific
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
respect
to
activity?
justice
potter
stewart
particularly,
i
wondered
whether
you
misput
the
trial
court
as
adding
this
as
--
as
something
additional
to
membership
or
as
being
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
indicia
of
membership.
