justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
of
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
--
suppose
one
of
the
larger
parties,
during
the
days
of
prohibition
that
it
had
just
one
plank
in
his
platform,
open
violation
of
the
provisional.
could
membership
in
that
party
have
been
made
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
membership.
you
made
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
shown
that
a
person
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
official
in
a
county
or
state,
and
that
one
plank
in
the
platform
of
the
party
was
open
violation
of
the
federal
prohibition.
could,
even
if
convicted
of
a
crime
for
being
a
member
of
that
active
member
of
that
party
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
can
help
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
it
was
shown
that
he
was
an
official
of
the
party
and
that
he
knew
that
it
was
advocating
the
open
violation
of
the
prohibition.
it
was
a
political
party
and
that
was
simply
one
plank
in
its
platform.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it
would
become
the
question
of
how
you
would
show
that
he
intended
to
accomplish
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
an
additional
that
you
wouldn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
was
shown
that
he
not
only
was
a
member,
but
he
knew
about
it
and
he
thought
that
is
a
good
plank
in
the
platform,
but
it
--
yet,
it
had
many
other
planks
in
its
platform.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
showing
here
about
any
action
taken
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
basically,
it's
not
the
membership,
even
knowing
membership
in
a
party,
by
one
plank
of
it
is
illegal,
it's
a
violation
of
the
law,
but
you
construing
this
act
as
meaning
that
there
must
be
charge
and
must
be
proved
actual
knowledge
and
intent
and
purpose
to
do
that
and
actively
aiding
other
people
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
others
words,
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
charging
is
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
socialist
party,
along
with
all
the
other
planks
in
its
platform,
would
decide
to
adopt
the
plank
and
confiscate
property
without
paying
for
it.
that
would
be
illegal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
confiscate
it
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
unconstitutional,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
paying
for
it,
and
they
advocated
they
were
going
to
take
it
away
from
them.
could
membership
in
that
party
be
made
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
knowledge
and
intent,
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand,
that
one
plank
in
this
platform,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
one
purpose
is
eventually
to
overthrow
the
government
or
within
some
--
i
forgotten
the
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
as
soon
as
possible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
from
what
you
answered
to
justice
frankfurter,
your
position
is
that
if
you
show
that
a
man
is
a
member
of
a
party
which
has
an
illegal
aim,
and
he
knows
about
it
and
believes
in
it,
and
works
for
the
party,
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
his
membership
in
that
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say
an
active.
justice
hugo
l.
black
active
member
of
the
party
one
of
--
which
has
one
illegal
aim
and
he
likes
that
aim,
and
it
has
other
aims.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
also,
he
has
an
intent
to
carry
out
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
it's
violating
the
prohibition
law,
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
intends
to
see
that
that
law
is
violated.
justice
hugo

on
the
next
page,
he
said
he
got

1952.
it
deals

it's
not
in
d.c.--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
(inaudible)
who
did
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
one
o
--
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
deal
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
77?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
there
are
2400
pages
of
whatever
it
is
and
it
includes
all
the
exhibits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
the
exhibits
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
shown
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
time
to
read
those?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
activity?
you
had
added
some
quotes
from
the
communist
cases
and
it's
regarding
some
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
writes
and
says,
“i
am
writing,
because
i'm
a
member
of
the
party
and
i
want
to
put
a
program
into
the
same.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
writing
this
on
my
typewriter
and
i
want
to
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
usually
member
is
--
somebody
belong
to
the
democratic
or
republican
parties,
rather
than
to
say
i'm
a
good
democrat
or
good
republican,
i
want
you
go
get
ticket,
writing
a
letter
or
distribute
seculars,
and
the
action,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
at
least
if
he
had
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
solicit
votes
for
a
party,
how
can
you
say
that
you
can
make
it
a
crime
into
the
law
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
correct
in
saying
emphatically,
you
do
not
have
that
question
here
in
any
way.
if
it
is
a
crime
you
shall
be
(inaudible)
this
party,
they
solicit
votes
but
is
it
a
crime
to
belong
to
this
party?
you
have
to
a
certain
extent,
you
have
to
know,
it
outlaws
it.
that
outlaws
it
entirely.
that's
a
complete
outlaw
of
the
party
which
would
in
time,
i
would
presume,
i
don't
know.
i
would
presume
it
would
outlaw
the
solicitation
of
votes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
knowledge,
suppose
he
had
knowledge.
he
knew
that
intended
--
that
they
intended
to
solicit
votes
on
a
platform
which
calls
for
eventual
revolution.
the
first
time
they
got
enough
to
have
--
have
a
revolution
successfully.
they
announced
publicly
that
--
they
put
it
in
a
platform,
per
se.
and
then
he
solicited
votes
for
them,
would
he
not
have
committed
a
crime,
as
a
part
of
the
crime
because
(inaudible)?
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
could
be
it
a
clear
and
present
danger
for
a
man
to
solicit
votes
for
a
party
openly
if
he's
going
to
do
it?
or
even
though
if,
some
other
who
stands
on
the
platform
that
eventually
he
wants
to
present
--
to
do
something
that
would
concede
him
winning,
that's
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(inaudible)
whereby
naming
them
and
wholly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
--
suppose
they
were
--
wrote
a
platform
out
as
a
party
here,
that
it
was
wrong
for
the
people
not
to
hold
their
own
property
in
this
picture
and
that
they
were
soliciting
votes
on
the
basis
of
them
confiscating
everybody's
property,
that
would
be
illegal,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
it
could
--
would
it
be
illegal
to
confiscate
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
we
said,
we
don't
believe
in
that.
we're
gong
to
confiscate
everybody's
property.
just
as
soon
as
we
get
enough
votes,
could
the
party
be
outlawed
under
this
argument
that
--
as
we
gave
it
such
a
thought?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
it
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitutionally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
a
party
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
only
safety
of
a
party,
that's
the
only
safety
that
a
party
have
depend
on
the
particular
facts
that
could
be
proven
to
represent
what?
it
wants
to
do
some
kind
of
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
suppose
we
forget
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
come
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
come
in
on
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
can
i
ask
you
this
because
i'm
looking
over
the
history
of
it,
of
this
kind
of
a
law.
has
there
ever
before
in
this
country,
i
--
i
don't
know,
an
outlaw
writ
of
a
party
that's
presented
to
the
people
to
decide
and
elect
candidates
and
to
affect
public
question,
the
wisdom
to
it,
sought
membership
on
that
basis
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it's
a
crime
to
be
member
of
it
knowing
the
presence
of
it,
what's
the
difference
in
that
and
outlawing
your
party?
i'm
not
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
can't
be
constitutional,
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
something
else.
i
don't
remember
what's
the
connection
of
the
party,
as
i
could
--
as
i
would
recall,
certain
groups
were
--
take
charge
and
change
things
that's
supposed
inferior,
maybe
that's
what
was
intended
by
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
it
may
not
fit
here
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
say
it
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
provided
a
number
of
years
and
--
and
its
been
outlawed
by
a
different
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
membership
is
a
crime,(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
judge
always
by
the
intent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
submit
the
intent
of
it,
the
man
who
belongs
to
the
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
party
that's
not
trying
to
incite
people
that
comes
out
of
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
party
that's
not
trying
to
urge
people
or
incite
them
or
whatever
word
you
wish
to
use
that's
synonymous
to
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
urge
them
to
take
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
a
lot
about
moving
forward,
is
that
what
you
mean
that
he
--
or
it's
a
question
of
what
it
is
that
has
to
be
done?
and
you
finally
get
to
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
this
does
depend,
does
it
not,
whether
this
power
in
the
government
could
outlaw
any
party
and
it
can
show
that
it
has
ultimate
objectives
that
are
illegal
and
where
the
man
knows
they're
illegal,
(inaudible)
that
is
his
right.
that
--
where
he
knows
they're
illegal,
if
the
congress
believes
it
and
this
court
says
an
irrational
basis
or
proof
for
it,
and
that
the
--
there's
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
--
within
this
government
that
the
party
could
be
outlawed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
illegality,
the
kind
we
had
when
we
got
a
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
people
to
try
and
overthrow,
where
your
action
--
actually
actions
here
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice

you
are
saying
it
could
be
treated
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black

justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice

black
(inaudible)
can
outlaw
the
actions
or
can
outlaw
the
group
by
simply

that
association?
justice
hugo

black
there's
some
history
of
that
in
this
--
justice

(inaudible)
