mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
very
heart
of
the
petitioner's
case
is
that
congress
has
attempted
to
punish
guilt
by
association
and
that
this
is
unconstitutional.
we
agree
that
a
man
may
not
be
punished
for
the
sins
of
others
but
only
for
his
own
fault
that
can
be
brought
onto
him
personally.
any
other
course
would
be
dangerous
indeed
since
the
motives
which
lead
a
man
to
associate
himself
with
others
may
be
quite
different
from
the
main
motifs
of
the
persons
with
whom
he
becomes
associated.
a
man
might
join
the
communist
party
because
he
was
lonely.
he
might
join
it
for
romantic
reasons.
he
might
not
approve
of
the
purposes.
we
feel
that
you've
got
to
bring
the
guilt
onto
the
individual
in
order
that
he
may
be
punished.
but
the
petitioner's
argument
depends
upon
reading
the
statute
in
the
most
unfavorable
way
that
it
can
be
read.
it
requires
one
to
read
the
word
“membership”
as
being
the
equivalent
of
being
carried
on
the
party
rolls.
now,
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
entire
structure
of
the
smith
act
that
congress
had
something
quite
different
in
mind.
in
section
1,
they
forbid
people
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
in
section
3,
they
hold
that
it
--
they
make
it
illegal
to
organize
a
machine
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
and,
in
the
membership
clause
which
we
are
dealing
with,
they
make
it
illegal
for
a
person
to
make
that
machine
run.
in
other
words,
we
would
argue
here,
as
we
argued
in
our
supplemental
brief
before
the
court
last
term,
that
when
congress
uses
the
word
“membership,”
it
means
active
membership.
it
means
something
more
than
being
carried
on
the
rolls
of
the
party.
and,
it
was
because
of
this
interpretation
that,
when
the
case
went
back
for
retrial,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
in
order
to
find
the
defendant
guilty,
it
must
find
that
he
was
not
only
a
member
but
an
active
member
of
a
proscribed
organization.
now,
this
is
not
really
amending
the
--
amending
the
statute
by
judicial
construction.
it's
--
it's
construing
the
statute
to
determine
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
when
it
passed
it.
it
is
something
which
the
court
does
in
determining
the
constitutionalities
of
statutes
day
after
day.
on
membership
itself,
we
find
the
courts
have
--
have
frequently
read
the
term
“membership”
in
order
to
determine
what
would
be
a
reasonable
meaning
in
the
--
in
the
minds
of
congress.
i
think
a
very
important
case
in
this
is
--
is
colyer
against
skeffington.
it's
a
district
court
case
but
it's
a
case
which
--
which
passed
directly
on
it,
whether
the
district
court
said
that
the
immigration
law
provision
for
--
for
sending
aliens
home
could
not
be
applied
to
aliens
who
accidentally,
artificially,
or
unconsciously,
in
appearance
only
are
found
to
be
members
or
affiliated
with
a
--
with
a
subversive
organization.
and
we
find
this
court
using
the
same
thought
of
approach
in
bridges
against
wixon,
where
they
said
that,
in
that
case,
they
were
dealing
with
the
term
“affiliation”
as
well
as
“membership”
but
where
they
said
that
the
affiliation
had
to
be
an
active
thing.
it
had
to
be
a
giving
of
aid
rather
than
merely
an
agreement
with
the
--
with
the
organization.
and,
so,
i
say
that
the
only
--
the
only
way
that
this
--
that
the
petitioner
can
support
his
argument
is
by
taking
a
--
a
limited
meaning
of
--
of
the
word
“membership”
which
is
very
probably,
almost
inevitably,
quite
contrary
to
what
the
congress
had
intended.
and,
once
we
--
once
we
discard
this
limited
interpretation
which
is
urged
by
the
petitioner,
then
i
think
that
the
case
really
involves
no
constitutional
question
which
is
different
from
that
which
was
involved
in
--
in
the
dennis
case
and
in
the
yates
case
because
i
see
no
constitutional
difference
between
forbidding
persons
to
organize
a
--
a
party
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
forbidding
persons
to
make
that
party
operate
once
it
has
been
organized.
there
may
be
a
difference
in
degree.
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
no
difference
in
kind
and,
since
this
court
has
met
the
constitutional
problem
in
dennis
and
has
really
supported
it
in
yates,
i
think
that
it
really
decide
--
it's
decided
it
for
this
case,
nor
do
i
think
that
the
brandeis-holmes
concurrence
in
the
whitney
case,
to
which
general
taylor
referred,
is
against
this.
in
that
concurrence,
they
were
not
really
talking
about
membership
as
distinguished
from
the
activity.
they
were
actually
talking
about
both
organization
and
membership,
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
organization
and
membership,
together,
constituted
a
clear
and
present
danger
sufficient
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
the
opinion
in
the
very
paragraph
which
is
quoted
by
the
petitioner,
the
opinion
flunks
the
membership
and
the
organizing
features
into
one
legal
question.
and,
in
any
event,
i
may
say
that,
in
this
particular
case,
on
the
pec
--
basis
of
this
particular
record,
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
determine
the
constitutionality
or
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
applied
to
an
entirely
different
set
of
facts
where
this
is
no
active
membership.
as
judge
hand
pointed
out
in
the
dennis
case,
the
statute
--
the
smith
act
contains
a
separability
clause
providing
that
if
the
statute
shall
be
held
--
the
statute
or
any
part
of
the
statute
shall
be
held
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
any
particular
circumstance
or
situation,
it
shall
not
affect
its
remaining
in
effect
with
respect
to
a
different
circumstance,
a
different
situation.
and
so,
here,
i
say
that
in
a
situation
where
you
have
active
membership
found
by
the
jury,
sustained
by
the
court
below,
there
is
no
occasion
for
this
court
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
this
particular
statute
to
a
situation
where
there
is
no
active
membership.
now,
with
this
interpretation
in
mind
and
with
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
yates
case
in
mind
as
to
what
congress
intended
to
outlaw,
that
is,
that
it
intended
to
outlaw
advocacy
of
action,
incitement
to
action
rather
than
the
promotion
of
thoughts,
of
ideas,
i
think
that
the
next
real
question
is
whether
or
not,
on
this
record,
the
government
proved
its
case,
whether
it
proved
that
the
communist
party
as
such,
and
we
are
not
talking
now,
if
you
please,
about
the
defendant
--
about
the
petitioner,
scales,
we're
talking
about
the
communist
party
as
such
because,
under
the
terms
of
the
act,
the
important
thing
is
whether
the
party
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
question
is
does
this
record
establish
that
the
communist
party
does
engage
in
illegal
advocacy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
communist
party
is
--
as
a
whole
and
the
communist
party
to
which
the
defendant
the
--
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
f.
davis
could
membership
as
itself,
per
se?
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
that
membership
by
itself
can
be
made
a
crime
in
any
event,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
membership
in
the
sense
that
we
have
it
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
by
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
that
by
itself
alone,
your
honor,
because
that
is
--
and
that
is
not
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that
he
intended
to
accomplish
that,
as
with
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
question
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
whether
we
approved
that
knowledge
and
intent
in
this
case,
and
i
intend
to
come
to
that,
but
that
is
an
element
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
it
would
be
difficult.
in
--
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
dennis
case
--
in
the
dennis
case
you
said
that
you
needed
to
show
his
willfulness
and
intent
to
accomplish
the
unlawful
activity,
that
that
intent
was
necessarily
a
part
of
the
statute,
and
that's
so
here.
there
must
be
this
intent
to
carry
out
the
illegal
purpose.
now,
if
in
your
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
going
to
come
--
when
i
get
through
with
the
evidence
as
to
the
party,
i
am
going
to
come
then
to
the
knowledge
and
intent
of
this
particular
defendant
and
tying
it
into
the
party
purpose.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
far
as
intent
goes,
i
think
your
honors'
opinions
in
the
--
it's
nearly
said
opinion,
opinions
in
the
dennis
case
and
in
the
yates
case,
put
that
burden
on
us.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
we
have
to.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
no,
i
am
charging
we
have
to
prove
intent
by
action,
of
course,
yes,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
has
to
have
done
illegal
things.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
has
to
show
that
he
intended
that
the
party
should
carry
out,
and
i
should
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
evidence
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
force
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
--
again,
i
say
membership
per
se,
there
is
no
argument
--
the
government
makes
no
argument
that
by
associating
itself,
just
by
associating
with
the
group,
that
one
adopts
the
aims
of
the
group.
we
cannot
sustain
that.
we
have
here,
under
the
statue
and
under
the
dennis
case,
membership
with
knowledge
and
with
intent.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
membership
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
soon
a
possible.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and,
we
--
we
have
felt
that,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we're
not
writing
these.
the
court's
decisions
require
this
intent
that
statute
itself
spells
out
knowledge
and
the
s
--
and
the
court
itself,
in
the
dennis
and
the
yates
cases,
spelled
out
intent.
the
only
new
factor
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
the
active
membership,
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
spelled
that
out,
too,
in
bridges
against
wixon
and
the
roll
out
case
and
the
other
cases
dealing
with
membership
in
connection
with
deportations.
but,
the
question
is
--
the
first
question
on
the
evidence
is
whether
or
not
the
government
proved
that
this
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
communist
party
because
this
court's
decision
in
the
yates
case
says
that,
in
that
case,
the
government
didn't
prove
that
the
communist
party
was
a
party
which
--
one
of
the
objects
of
which
was
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
rowoldt
case
isn't
as
useful
as
the
bridges
and
wixon
and
the
colyer
against
skeffington
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
in
that
case,
it
said
--
it
said
in
that
case,
in
rowoldt
or
in
galvan
against
press,
it
said
that,
as
far
as
deportation
goes,
you
didn't
have
to
prove
that
the
man
knew
the
entire
aims
of
the
party.
in
that
case,
membership
knowing
that
it
was
a
--
active
membership
knowing
that
it
was
a
party
was
called
sufficient.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that's
specifically
colyer
against
skeffington,
and
i
think
it's
what
meant
in
rowoldt
when
the
question
was
did
he
know
that
he
was
as
a
mem
--
was
it
--
did
he
know
that
he
was
being
a
member
or
was
it
just
something
formal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
the
colyer
against
skeffington
i
think
is,
although
the
court
is
--
the
lower
court,
i
think,
that
the
decision
is
better
from
my
point
of
view
on
that
matter.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
when
the
government
had
to
prove,
in
this
case,
the
communist
party
was
a
party
which
was
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
obviously,
the
written
materials,
the
constitution,
the
foundations
of
leninism,
the
basic
text
of
the
communist
party
would
be
the
same.
we
don't
discover
new
basic
documents
in
the
communist
party.
the
basic
documents
which
were
introduced
in
this
case
were
the
same
as
the
basic
documents
that
were
introduced
in
yates.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
mean
to
evade
you.
i
don't
know
whether
you,
in
using
the
term
“a
member,”
whether
you
said
an
active
member.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
he
intends
to
carry
out
that
aim.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
you've
got
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
have
to
prove
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
then,
i
would
say
that
you
--
that
congress,
constitutionally,
is
not
punishing
him
for
association
but
it's
punishing
hm
for
using
another
instrument
to
carry
out
an
illegal
purpose.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
he
is
promoting
an
illegal
purpose
through
his
activity,
and
i
see
no
reason
why
the
government
cannot
punish
him
for
it.
the
texts
were
the
same.
the
basic
communist
text
for
it
was
the
same
but,
from
then
--
from
there
on,
the
government
tried
the
case
differently
and,
of
course,
it
tried
that
case
differently.
the
supreme
court
had,
in
the
yates
case,
had
told
the
government
what
it
was
necessary
to
prove
in
order
to
establish
its
case,
and
it
proceeded
to
prove
it.
it
proceeded
to
prove
that
these
texts
were
used
in
schools,
not
one
school
in
one
place
but
in
schools
run
by
the
communist
party
in
new
york,
and
in
saint
louis,
and
in
chicago,
and
in
san
francisco,
and
in
north
carolina,
and
in
other
places
that
these
texts
were
used
by
instructors,
not
one
instructor
but
half-a-dozen,
maybe
a
dozen
instructors
and
were
interpreted
by
them
to
the
students
of
the
school
as
requiring
an
overthrow
by
force
and
violence
in
order
to
achieve
the
aims
of
the
communist
party.
and,
this
wasn't
just
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
well,
the
most
recent
of
those
schools
was
in
1952
or
1953
and
that
was
the
one
that,
in
north
carolina,
at
walnut
cove
in
north
carolina.
the
other
schools,
well,
the
duran
testimony
was
in
1951
as
for
san
francisco
and,
i
think,
1952
in
colorado.
jones'
school
which
were
in
saint
louis
--
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
have
notes
here
that
he
was
a
member
from
1947
to
1954
and
i'm
not
sure
when
he
entered
the
school.
clontz's
school
in
new
york
was
in
1950.
the
lochner
and
hartel
testimonies
were
for
earlier
schools,
but
these
schools
run
from
about
1947.
the
jones
school
was
in
1947.
the
schools
run
from
the
middle-1940s
up
through
1952.
mr.
john
f.
davis
sure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
yates
case?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
well,
i
haven't
been
able
to
put
my
hand
on
the
transcript
in
the
yates
case.
i'm
sure
it's
available
to
me,
but
i
looked
at
the
printed
record
in
the
case,
the
--
i
think
that
the
only
common
witness
in
this
case
was
lochner,
and
i
may
be
wrong
on
that,
but
i
--
so
far
as
i
could
make
out,
there
was
very
little
correspondence
in
the
actual
witnesses
in
this
case
and
in
the
yates
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
may
be
so.
i
may
be
entirely
wrong.
in
this
case,
there
were
three
witnesses
who
were
north
carolina
--
who
dealt
particularly
with
the
north
carolina
picture,
and
then
there
were
five
witnesses
who
dealt
with
the
aims
of
the
communist
party
as
such,
and
i
was
under
the
misimpression
maybe
that
lochner
was
the
common
witness.
it
may
be
that
there
wasn't
a
common
witness.
well,
my
associate
hand
me
a
note
saying,
and
obviously
he
hasn't
check
the
--
the
transcript
since
your
honor
reminded,
that
he
says
lochner
did
testify
in
yates
and
was
the
only
common
witness.
the
teaching
which
these
lecturers
and
these
teachers
gave
in
these
schools
was
not
teaching
on
a
theoretical
or
economic
or
maxi
and
in
the
political
sense
terms.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
but
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
it's
very
important
because,
in
the
ta
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
case
of
yates,
this
court
specifically
held
we
hadn't
proved
enough
and
the
petitioner
asserts
that
we
haven't
proven
anymore
here,
and
i
want
to
assure
you
that
the
petitioner
has
overstated
his
position.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
i'm
not
going
to
spend
too
long
going
in
this
record
because
i
suspect
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
spent
some
time
in
the
record
itself
but,
just
to
sh
--
to
illustrate,
and
this
can
--
i
could
multiply
this,
i
assure
you
i
could
multiply
it,
just
to
illustrate
that
they
are
talking
about
concrete
advocacy
of
overthrow,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
advocacy
of
forcible
--
of
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
that
they
--
the
committee,
the
party
--
the
communist
party,
their
teachers,
their
lecturers
were
preaching
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
one
of
the
elements
that
runs
through
this
record
or
runs
in
many
places
of
it
is
the
effort
of
the
communist
party
to
develop
what
is
called
the
black-belt
of
the
black
nation,
that
is,
to
stir
up
the
negro
population.
and,
this
isn't
the
matter
of
merely
protecting
their
civil
rights.
this
is
a
matter
of
instigating
them
to
action.
and,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
record,
page
391,
and
we're
dealing
here
with
a
speaker
who
came
to
north
carolina
and
scales,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
asked
this
witness,
his
name
was
childs,
to
act
as
a
bodyguard
for
this
man
while
he
made
some
speeches
at
various
places
in
north
carolina.
and,
at
page
391,
we
find
mr.
childs
beginning
to
tell
what
this
communist
speaker
stated.
well,
his
speech
concerned
the
korean
war
and,
in
this
speech,
he
pointed
out
that
the
korean
war
was
being
used
by
the
capitalists
as
means
of
suppressing
the
negro
people.
he
said
that
--
he
said
that
the
capitalist
are
sending
the
negros
to
korea
to
fight
the
korean
people
who
are
trying
to
fight
for
their
rights,
the
same
as
the
negro
people
are
in
the
south.
then,
skipping
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
page,
he
says,
“here
is
one
paragraph
from
the
speech,”
and
he'd
made
notes
of
it.
so,
he
read
from
his
notes.
“do
you
want
me
to
use
his
exact
words?”
and
here
is
what
the
witness
said.
“in
korea,
they
are
still
called
nigers.
nigers
are
court-martialed
for
refusing
to
have
their
men
slottered.
lieutenant
gilbert
is
one
example.
they
say
that
the
niger
is
yellow.
yellow
give
the
nigers
in
north
carolina
or
in
georgia
riffles
and
tell
them
to
fight
for
their
rights.
yellow
man,
you
will
see
fighting
like
you
have
never
seen
before.”
there
is
other
material
in
this
record
on
this
same
--
on
the
same
line
in
connection
with
the
so-called
black
nation
and
the
black-belt,
and
it
is
only
one
of
the
examples
of
the
kind
of
--
it
shows
that
this
advocacy
in
this
case
is
not
advocacy
of
some
political
theory.
it's
actual
advocacy
of
action.
they're
talking
about
mimeograph
machines
in
order
to
--
that
can
be
hidden
in
the
houses,
radios
for
communications,
people
who
can
handle
money
when
large
amounts
of
money
are
necessary.
the
--
going
under
the
--
into
the
underground
and
the
methods
of
keeping
in
touch
with
each
other,
the
record
teams
with
incitements
to
action.
now,
the
petitioner
attacks
some
of
this
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it's
too
strong,
that
it's
unfair
to
him
to
have
this
kind
of
evidence
in
the
case
because
it's
not
tied
up
with
the
particular
--
with
his
particular
activities.
he
would
have
us
walk
a
narrow
road
indeed.
the
statute
requires
us
to
prove
that
the
communist
party
as
such
is
engaged
in
this
endeavor.
we
also
have
to
prove
his
connection
with
it
and
his
connection
with
the
party
and
his
intent
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
not
in
--
not
in
any
--
i
don't
know
that
he
was
there
even.
it
was
in
north
carolina.
that's
the
most
i
know.
this
is
introduced
to
show
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
was
patterson,
but
this
speech
that
i'm
reading
from
was
made
the
next
day
in
winston,
salem,
i
believe,
and
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
the
same
man.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
patterson.
by
the
way,
in
this
--
at
this
place
in
the
record,
all
it
shows
about
patterson,
since
i've
called
attention
to
it,
i
don't
want
to
have
the
court
misled.
all
it
--
it
doesn't
identify
him
as
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
but,
earlier
in
the
record,
earlier
in
his
own
--
in
this
same
record,
it's
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
exhibits,
i
don't
remember
the
number,
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
central
committee
of
the
communist
party
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
question
of
his
connection
with
the
party.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
thought
it
said
in
winston,
salem,
your
honor.
let
me
be
sure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
39
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
may
be
so.
my
geog
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
winston,
salem
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
thought
chapel
hill
was
a
separate
town
where
the
university
of
north
carolina
was
and
that
winston,
salem
is
where
you
have
the
cigarette
and
western
kinds
of
acts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
were
operating
in
duran
where
it
not
--
where
the
university
--
where
duke
is
and,
in
chapel
hill
where
the
university
of
north
carolina
is,
and
i
think
winston,
salem
is
a
separate
town.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
made
--
i
guess
it
was
at
chapel
hill
where
he
made
his
own
--
your
honor
is
quite
right.
it
says
that
it
was
thursday
and
wednesday
night
in
chapel
hill.
in
any
event,
it's
important,
of
course,
that
we
tie
in
this
petitioner
with
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
--
illegal
aims
and
purposes
of
communist
party.
and,
i
think
that
it
is
done
tremendously
through
the
testimony
of
both
childs
and
clontz,
who
went
to
the
petitioner
with
request
to
be
instructed
in
the
ways
of
the
communist
party.
and,
their
testimony
as
to
his
instructions
to
them
detailed
about
the
necessity
of
there
being
overthrow
through
violence.
i
mean,
he
told
--
he
gave
them
materials.
he
underlined
the
materials
by
telling
them
orally
that
violence
was
the
only
way
--
that
revolution
was
the
only
way
that
they
could
ever
attain
the
--
their
objectives.
and,
then,
this
witness
childs,
who
was
the
last
witness
in
the
case,
attended
a
school
which
--
of
which
the
director
was
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
himself
was
the
director
of
a
communist
school
held
at
walnut
cove
and
there's
detailed
description
of
what
went
on
in
that
school
and
the
--
what
was
taught
in
the
school.
and,
there,
they
tie
it
down
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
himself
sat
in
a
small
study
group
with
two
or
three
other
people
while
this
instruction
was
being
given
to
the
witness.
so,
that
whatever
--
if
we
have
proof
that
there
is
--
that
this
isn't
an
object,
then
we
have
proof
that
there
was
knowledge
and
that
there
was
intent
on
the
part
of
this
petitioner
to
participate
in
that
purpose.
mr.
john
f.
davis
childs
was
the
--
well,
in
this
record,
they've
got
comings
in
last
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
got
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yet,
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
you
--
there
is,
it's
just
out
of
place,
your
honor.
you
find
after
the
appendix,
you
find
the
less
--
beginning
--
just
before
page
1,
the
way
this
record
is
made
up,
presumably
for
saving
printing,
there's
a58
is
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
then,
you
find
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and,
you've
turned
it
just
to
page
1
to
find
the
contents.
no,
but
i
can't
--
but
that's
where
i
looked.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
looked
at
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
a1.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
just
before
the
page
1
without
an
a
before
it.
and,
there,
you'll
find
that
childs'
testimony
begins
at
380
and
runs
through
435.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
that
page
was
snipped
out
and
put
under
the
--
in
the
first
column,
under
the
column.
petitioner
has
argued
here,
as
he
argued
below,
that
in
inciting
to
action,
the
government
relied
upon
any
incitement
to
any
kind
of
action,
whether
it
was
lawful
action
or
unlawful
action.
and,
he
refers
to
some
testimony
with
respect
to
getting
people
to
write
to
congressmen
with
respect
to
the
korean
war
and
some
of
those
of
things,
and
there
is
a
remark
--
there
is
a
remark
by
government
counsel
in
connection
with
the
introduction
of
these
three
exhibits
which
can
be
read
to
mean
that
this
means
incitement
to
action.
and,
i
think
that
remark
is
erroneous.
but
the
charge
of
the
jury
--
the
charge
of
the
--
of
the
judge
to
the
jury
is
perfectly
clear
on
this.
there
was
--
general
--
general
taylor
said
that
the
charge
with
respect
to
incitement
to
action
began
at
page
40.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
better
to
start
with
page
a
--
a39.
i
am
sorry
but
it's
not
39,
it's
a39.
the
appendix
to
the
--
the
first
appendix.
and,
if
you
start
at
page
39,
the
second
paragraph
down,
and
run
them
through
the
material
which
general
taylor
referred
to,
i
think
you'll
have
the
entire
instruction
with
respect
to
incitement
and
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
follows
very
carefully,
indeed
it
would
be
strange
if
it
didn't,
that
it
follows
very
carefully
the
instructions
which
this
court,
in
effect,
gave
in
the
yates
case.
so
that
the
idea
that
this
jury
found
incitement
on
the
basis
of
incitement
to
legal
action,
in
--
in
light
of
this
charge,
seems
to
me
is
--
is
impossible.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
question
of
construction
which
arises
because
of
the
presence
of
section
--
subsection
(f)
in
section
4
of
the
internal
security
act.
as
general
taylor
has
said,
the
internal
security
act
of
the
section
which
was
involved
in
--
with
this
case
dealt
with
the
registration
of
communist
organizations.
and
at
--
after
--
while
it
was
on
--
on
the
floor
in
the
house,
a
letter
was
written
by
the
john
davis
and
by
the
attorney
general
in
a
second
letter,
and
both
of
these
letters
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
statute
might
be
attacked
on
constitutionality
on
the
ground
that
it
would
require
a
person
to
confess
a
crime
by
registering.
first,
they
amended
it
by
saying
that
the
registration
couldn't
be
introduced
in
evidence,
and
lawyers
in
the
congress
said
that's
not
enough.
the
fact
you
can't
introduce
the
registration
itself
in
evidence
won't
give
protection.
you've
got
to
go
further.
so,
then,
they
introduced
this
provision,
which
now
appears
in
the
smith
act,
which
reads
“neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
by
any
person
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
subsection
(a)
or
subsection
(c)
of
this
section
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute.”
so,
insofar
as
the
language
is
important
here
is,
membership
per
se
shall
not
be
considered
a
violation
of
any
other
criminal
statute,
and
it's
agreed
that
they
had
the
smith
act
in
mind
when
they
talked
about
“any
other
criminal
statute.”
and
then,
there
is
subs
--
then,
there
is
section
17
which
provides
the
foregoing
provisions
of
this
subject
shall
be
construed
as
being
in
addition
to,
and
not
in
modification
of,
existing
criminal
statute.
now,
what
congress
was
obviously
doing
here
was
saying
“when
we
get
somebody
up
for
not
registering,
we
don't
want
them
to
say
we
didn't
have
to
register
because
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
required
us
to
confess
a
crime.”
they
were
saying
it
isn't
a
crime
to
be
a
member
per
se,
and
they
say
it
shan't
be
a
member
--
it
shan't
be
a
crime
under
(a),
subsection
(a).
it
shan't
be
a
crime
under
subsection
(c)
or
any
other
statute,
including
the
smith
act.
so,
they
were
saying
that
no
one
could
escape
registration
on
the
ground
of
constitutionality
on
that
ground.
now,
this
may
be
an
aid
to
--
to
construction
of
--
of
the
smith
act.
indeed,
it
may
show
congressional
intent
long
after
the
event,
to
be
sure,
that
--
that
they
didn't
mean
just
membership
or
just
office-holding
to
be
criminal
by
itself,
but
it
cannot
--
i
think
it
cannot
be
said
to
show
any
intent
to
repeal
those
sections.
now,
this
court
could
say,
i
think,
although
none
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
difficulty
with
this
problem,
i
may
say
it's
been
up
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
that,
in
none
of
--
in
all
of
those
circuits,
it's
--
the
construction
which
the
government
is
urging
here
has
been
sustained.
it
--
the
court
could
hold
that
this
was
a
--
this
effected
a
repeal,
but
i
think
that
they'd
have
to
do
it
on
the
basis
that
congress
made
a
mistake.
congress,
in
using
these
words,
pulled
a
bona
that
they
repealed
it
against
their
will.
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
this
legislative
history
which
shows
that
congress
had
that
intent
to
do
it.
and,
i
really
can't
believe,
in
view
of
section
17,
that
this
court
could
reach
that
construction.
let
me
say
that
if
it
repeals
or
modifies
the
membership
clause
in
this
respect,
it
must
equally,
i
suppose,
modify
subsections
(a)
and
(c)
of
the
internal
--
of
section
4
of
the
internal
security
act
because
it's
used
in
perfect
parallel,
and
i
suppose
that
the
--
i
suppose
the
petitioner
must
argue
that
communist
party
is
--
members
of
communist
party
are
no
longer
subject
to
sections
(a)
and
(c)
of
the
internal
security
act.
he
hasn't
made
the
argument
in
its
brief.
it
doesn't
sound
very
convincing,
but
the
provisions
are
in
perfect
parallel.
and,
if
you're
going
to
argue
that
it
is
a
re
--
a
modification
or
appeal
of
one,
i
should
think
that
you'd
have
to
argue
that
it
was
a
modification
on
the
repeal
of
all
three.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
haven't
gone
so
far
to
say
how
effective
it
is
and
say
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that
the
purpose
of
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
may
be
able
to
argue
the
communist
case
when
it
comes
up
here,
but
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
--
well,
i
am
--
i
think
that
it
is
not
before
this
court
whether
this
is
effective
to
say
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
in
the
--
in
this
type
of
communist
--
of
smith
act
case,
it
comes
about
that
the
defense,
seems
almost
automatically,
raises
certain
issues
in
the
case.
if
--
they
almost
always
raise
a
question
as
to
the
constitution
of
the
grand
jury.
if
there's
a
good
question
as
to
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury,
they
raise
it.
if
there
isn't
a
good
question,
they
raise
whatever
question
they
can.
and
so,
in
this
case,
they
attack
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury,
and
they
attack
it
on
the
basis
that
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
require,
as
they
doing
in
fact
require,
that
the
names
of
the
grand
jurors
be
drawn
from
a
box
which
contains
the
names
of
300
qualified
jurors.
now,
the
--
this
attack
was
made
late
and
there
is
a
real
question
as
to
whether
it
was
made
in
time,
and
the
court
below
threw
it
out
on
the
basis
that
it
wasn't
made
in
time.
i'll
leave
that
to
the
opinion
below.
if
it
was
made
in
time,
there
is
no
substance
to
the
attack.
there
was
a
hearing.
the
findings
of
the
district
judge
are
included
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
here.
and,
you
will
find
that
what
happened
was
that
the
jury
commissioner
and
the
deputy
clerk
wrote
letters
to
a
large
number
of
organizations
in
an
attempt
to
find
the
names
of
people
who
would
be
appropriate
to
service
jurors
and,
when
they
wrote
in
these
names,
the
deputy
clerk
and
the
jury
commissioner
sat
down
together
and
they
looked
over
the
list.
and,
if
they
found
anybody
that
they
believed
was
disqualified
or
that
they
knew
was
disqualified,
they
throw
it
out,
if
it
was
a
doctor
of
the
--
someone
who
have
been
convicted.
the
rest,
they
put
in
the
box
without
sending
a
questionnaire
to
these
people
to
find
out
whether
or
not
they
were
qualified
first
and,
at
the
time
this
grand
jury
was
drawn,
there
were
about
500
names
in
the
box.
and,
the
deputy
--
and
the
deputy
clerk
and
the
jury
commissioner
testified
in
the
hearing
that
they,
reason
--
on
the
basis
of
their
knowledge
of
the
community,
they
thought
they
were
reasonably
certain,
they
believe,
that
there
were
sufficient
number
of
people
in
--
of
qualified
jurors
in
the
box.
really,
the
essence
of
the
attack
is
there
should
have
been
a
questionnaire
sent
out
to
these
prospective
jurors
before
their
names
were
put
in
the
box
rather
than
after
they
drawn
and
then
you
ask
them
whether
they
had
their
qua
--
their
qualifications.
there's
not
an
indication
that
a
single
name
in
this
box
was
of
an
unqualified
person.
as
i
say,
i
think
that
the
--
there's
no
substance
to
this
attack
on
the
grand
jury
at
all.
then,
we
come
to
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
the
petitioner
takes
two
rather
inconsistent
positions
on
this.
first,
they
argue
that
the
government
relies
on
communist
activities
wholly
unrelated
to
the
defendant
and
that
this
was
improper,
and
that
it
didn't
--
and,
in
any
event,
it
didn't
prove
incitement.
well,
under
--
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
it
was
essential
for
us
to
prove
not
that
the
communist
party
in
one
locality
was
the
kind
of
an
approach
--
organization
which
was
proscribe,
but
the
party
as
such
was
the
kind
of
an
organization
proscribed
and,
because
of
that
reason,
we
couldn't
limit
it
to
individual
persons
in
north
carolina.
we
had
to
take
the
communist
party
as
such
because
that's
the
party
that
was
involved
here,
and
we
proceeded
to
try
to
prove
this
but,
now,
the
second
objection
comes
that
we've
proved
it
too
much.
we
proved
--
we
present
prejudicial
evidence
about
the
nature
of
the
party's
aims
and
we
proved
incitements
to
violence
which
are
so
strong,
it
just
said,
that
the
counsel
can't
read
them
in
this
court.
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
court
below
decided
these
questions
with
a
good
deal
of
common
sense.
it
spent
very
little
time
with
them.
it's
--
it
fine
--
it
reads
the
act
and
said
you
have
to
prove
this.
and,
as
to
over-proving
it,
that's
a
question
of
judgment
for
the
court
and
the
court
--
the
courts
found
that
these
matters
were
material.
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
even
mentioned
the
jencks
act
point
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
propose
to
go
into
it
unless
there
is
something
about
its
application
to
this
case
that
this
court
is
interested
in.
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court,
though,
exactly
what
went
on
so
they
can
see
how
the
jencks
act
did
operate
in
this
particular
case.
the
case
was
tried
after
the
act
has
been
passed,
and
many
of
these
witnesses
had
been
reporting
repeatedly
to
the
fbi,
so
that
there
were
voluminous
reports
made
by
these
witnesses
on
the
subject
matter
which
--
as
to
which
they
testified.
this
material,
all
of
it,
including
grand
jury
material
which
the
court
said
they
didn't
believe
they
had
to
turn
over
under
the
jencks
act
but
the
court
said
“we'll
let
them
have
it
anyway
because,
on
my
discretion,
i'm
going
to
exercise
my
discretion
to
let
them
have
it
in
this
case.”
all
of
the
reports
and
also
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
taken
by
the
court
and
exertions
were
made,
well,
exertions
were
requested
by
the
government.
they
turned
it
over
--
they
turned
over
excised
copies
of
the
documents
and
they
turned
over
un-excised
copies,
and
the
court
compared
the
two
to
determine
what
had
been
excised
and
whether
it
was
relevant
in
any
way
to
the
subject
matter
which
was
under
discussion.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
had
a
double
--
they're
in
the
--
they're
in
the
files
of
this
court,
the
excised
and
the
un-excised
documents.
and,
the
court
went
over
them
and
turned
them
over
to
counsel
for
use
in
cross-examination,
and
how
the
counsel
--
how
defense
counsel
could
try
the
case
with
that
volume
of
material
to
go
over,
i
can't
dream
because
there
are
two
cartons
of
these
reports
down
there.
and,
i'm
sure
that
this
must
have
proved
the
arduous
task
for
defense
counsel
to
try
to
go
through
these
reports
and
getting
it
out
in
the
night,
they
must
have
had
no
sleep
during
the
trial
if
they
read
all
these
reports
in
preparation
for
cross-examination.
but,
the
materials
were
turned
over
and
the
only
objection
in
this
court
is,
really,
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
jencks
act.
was
it
proper
to
let
the
--
well,
there
is
an
argument
on
ex
post
fact
--
that
this
is
ex
post
facto
but
i
won't
even
--
i'll
leave
it
to
the
brief
to
take
care
of
that.
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
it
was
constitutional
to
let
the
court
look
at
these
and
determine
whether
they
were
materials
which
were
not
material
to
the
testimony
which
had
been
given
in
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
excised.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
all
of
them,
although,
almost
all
of
them
but
there
were
--
there
was
a
re
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
record
--
yes,
the
record
does
show
this
and
there
--
much
of
what
went
on
was
--
went
on
in
chambers
and
isn't
in
the
record
but
i
am
--
i
think
i'm
safe
in
saying
that
what
is
actually
stated
in
the
printed
record
in
the
trans
--
in
the
transcript
is
--
which
was
what
happened
in
the
court
is
sufficient,
so
that
you
can
get
that
from
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that's
the
point.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
shall
pitch
my
argument
on
the
assumption
that
the
opinion
of
this
--
that
the
decision
in
united
states
against
dennis
is
still
good
law.
the
petitioners
have
not
asked
that
it'd
be
overruled
and
in
fact,
this
court,
in
the
yates
case
much
more
recent
than
the
dennis
case,
has
really
affirmed
the
principles
established
in
dennis.
so
i
think
that
the
earlier
cases
dealing
with
this
type
of
statutes
are
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
dennis
case
itself
and
that
our
problem
is
an
application
of
those
rules
to
the
membership
clause
as
such.
since
it
seems
unlikely
i
get
any
time
for
this
conclusion
of
the
argument,
i'd
like
to
spend
just
a
minute
or
two
at
the
beginning
with
respect
to
what
the
government
contends
this
record
establishes.
the
yates
case
went
off
in
--
upon
an
appraisal
of
what
the
evidence
prove
and
i
think
that
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
--
in
focus,
it's
well
to
consider
what
the
record
in
the
case
is,
at
least
as
--
as
we
view
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
indictment,
of
course
--
the
indictment
charges
that
scales
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
which
was
an
organization
which
advocated
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
forcing
violence,
and
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
purpose
of
the
party
and
that
he
intended
to
carry
it
out,
intended
the
best
purpose
should
be
carried
out
as
promptly
as
possible.
to
one
--
to
one
count
of
indictment,
it
deals
with
membership
and
only
membership.
it
doesn't
allege
conspiracy.
and
it
doesn't
allege
that
he
--
that
he
himself
has
advocated
that.
it
charges
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
party
with
knowledge
and
with
intent.
now,
the
court,
in
its
instructions
to
the
jury,
because
we
have
to
take
the
evidence
in
the
light
of
the
instructions,
the
court,
in
its
instructions
to
the
jury,
had,
for
its
guidance,
this
court's
opinion
in
yates.
and
so
it
was
very
careful
to
instruct
the
jury
that
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
in
proving
advocacy,
not
only
persuasion
but
had
to
prove
that
the
communist
party
was
engaging
in
inciting
to
action
to
carry
out
this
aim.
and
it
was
in
the
light
of
these
instructions
that
the
jury
found
the
--
the
defendant
guilty.
now,
what
was
the
evidence
on
--
on
the
advocacy
of
the
communist
party?
well,
the
bulk
of
the
evidence,
with
respect
to
the
party,
not
scales'
participation
in
it,
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
came
from
eight
witnesses
who
had
--
who
were
eyewitness
--
eyewitnesses
of
the
official
communist
schools
who
had
attended
these
schools
and
sat
and
heard
what
was
advocated
to
them.
and
these
schools
took
place
not
in
one
part
of
the
country
but
all
over
the
country.
they
were
in
new
york
and
they
were
in
st.
louis,
in
chicago,
in
washington
and
in
california.
and
these
eight
witnesses
testified
as
to
what
was
taught
in
the
communist
school.
and
they
were
specifically
on
with
respect
to
the
--
the
--
whether
or
not
the
advocacy
dealt
with
overthrow
by
force
and
violence.
and
everyone
of
these
schools
--
in
everyone
of
these
schools,
this
was
the
--
was
the
message
which
was
taught.
the
jury
had
this
before
them
and
the
jury
decided
at
this
point
as
been
proved.
then
the
question
is
was
this
merely
discussion,
was
this
merely
persuasion
or
does
this
amount
to
incitement
to
action?
here
again,
the
evidence
in
all
of
the
school
and
in
private
conversations
too
is
explicit.
the
students
were
told
that
theory
without
action
is
nothing.
they
were
told
about
--
they
were
--
they
were
encouraged,
they
were
instructed
to
take
place,
take
pride
in
concentrated
activity
in
industries
which
were
important
to
the
nation.
they
would
--
in
one
school,
they
would
require
to
take
an
oath
at
the
conclusion
of
the
school
that
they
would
act
to
carry
out
the
--
the
aims
of
the
party.
they
were
instructed
to
take
--
undertake
details
in
connection
with
the
underground,
details
in
connection
with
communications,
shelter,
publication
and
the
--
the
details
of
carrying
on
the
--
the
party's
duties
underground.
in
one
of
the
schools,
they
were
instructed
with
respect
to
methods
of
violence,
how
to
use
a
--
a
pencil
as
dagger.
in
other,
it
wasn't
in
the
school
but
the
defendant
himself
in
--
in
instructing
one
of
the
witnesses
suggested
that
he
attempt
to
avoid
the
draft
by
--
by
pretending
that
he
couldn't
pass
the
intelligence
examination.
the
--
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
which
show
that
this
teaching
wasn't
a
study
group
of
the
communist
manifesto,
of
the
average
communist
classics.
these
students
in
these
schools
were
being
taught
specific
action
which
they
should
take
in
order
to
prepare
the
--
the
party
to
carry
out
its
--
its
avowed
aims.
now,
the
third
element
in
proof
is
to
tie
the
petitioner
himself
into
these
pictures.
did
he
know
about
the
communist
thing?
if
he
did
know
about
them,
did
he
intend
that
they
should
be
carried
out?
now,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
an
open
and
avowed
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
district
for
north
and
south
carolina
for
a
long
period
of
years.
and
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
dispute
actually
that
he,
for
--
for
years
performed
the
functions
of
the
--
the
leader
of
the
communist
party
in
those
two
--
in
those
two
states.
he
organized
schools,
he
attended
schools
whether
our
eyewitness
accounts
of
the
teachings
of
the
school
is
including
force
and
violence.
he
himself
told
one
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case
that
force
and
violence
was
the
method
to
carry
out
the
aims
of
the
--
of
the
party.
he
told
that
the
witness
listen
in
so
many
words.
there
can
be
--
the
--
the
knowledge
of
the
communist
aims
and
purposes
is
brought
home
to
this
particular
petitioner
in
explicit
testimony
which
the
jury,
under
instructions,
believed.
so
the
only
question
then
is
whether
there
was
intent.
but
all
of
the
indicia
of
what
goes
on
in
the
man's
mind
would
indicate
that
he
did
intend
to
carry
out
these
purposes
which
he
taught
and
which
he
instructed
clontz,
reavis,
childs,
the
other
witnesses
as
to
what
they
should
do.
unless
he
was
--
unless
he
was
carrying
on
a
--
a
double
deceit
by
--
he
must
have
--
must
have
intended
the
things
which
he
taught
over
this
long
period
of
years.
therefore,
i
think
as
far
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
goes.
we
don't
have
anything
like
the
problems
that
occurred
in
the
yates
case.
the
case
was
tried
with
the
yates
case
in
mind,
the
instructions
were
good,
and
the
evidence,
it
seems
to
me,
certainly
justified
the
court
the
--
the
jury
in
making
the
findings
which
it
did.
therefore,
we
must
turn
to
the
questions
of
construction
and
questions
of
constitutionality.
and
i
shall
go
first,
as
mr.
taylor's
did,
to
the
question
of
section
4
(f)
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
modification
--
modification
of
the
smith
act
through
the
internal
security
act
which,
in
effect,
wrote
membership
in
the
communist
party
out
of
the
smith
act.
the
language
is,
"neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
by
any
person
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
section
--
subsection
(a)
or
subsection
(c)
of
this
section
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute."
in
another
section,
in
the
internal
security
act,
section
17
provides,
"the
foregoing
provisions
of
this
subchapter
shall
be
construed
as
being
in
addition
to
and
not
in
modification
of
existing
criminal
statutes."
but
taking
4
(f)
itself,
question
is
what
affects
could
4
(f)
have
upon
the
smith
--
upon
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
and
i
call
that
this
statute
is
--
is
printed
on
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
main
brief
2a
and
3a.
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
first
says
that
membership
per
se
shall
not
be
considered
a
crime
under
subsection
(a)
of
this
same
act.
i
assume
that
(f)
has
the
same
effect
on
(a)
and
(c)
that
it
does
on
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
it
is
intended
that
(f)
should
be
read,
in
effect,
as
part
of
the
smith
act
just
as
it
was
to
be
read
in
part
of
--
part
of
(a)
and
(c).
now,
if
the
petitioner's
argument
is
sound,
i
would
think
he
would
have
to
argue
that
no
longer
can
a
communist
because
of
his
communist
activities
be
proceeded
against
under
section
(a)
of
this
section.
he
would
have
to
say
that
they
wrote
the
communist
membership
in
the
communist
party,
participation
in
the
communist
party
out
of
section
(a)
and
section
(c)
in
the
same
that
they
--
he
would
claim
they
wrote
it
out
of
the
--
the
membership
clause.
yet,
it
seems
perfectly
apparent
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
you
should
no
longer
prosecute
communists
under
section
(a).
all
it
meant
was
that
you
couldn't
prove
a
violation
of
section
(a)
by
proving
membership
in
the
communist
party.
and
then
meant
equally,
you
may
not
prove
violation
of
the
membership
clause
by
proving
and
stopping
that
just
proving
membership
per
se.
and
our
question
really
comes
down
then
whether
they
meant
what
"per
se"
means,
whether
"per
se"
means
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
you
would.
under
the
language
of
(a),
you
have
to
prove
more
than
membership.
and
they
want
--
that
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
no
one
could
attack
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
--
if
they're
going
to
read
the
communist
party
out
of
the
membership
clause
as
such,
i
would
think
they
would
have
to
read
it
out
of
section
(a),
something
else
has
to
be
proved
with
the
membership
clause.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
there
isn't
a
membership
--
there
is
--
and
we
assert
there
isn't
a
membership
per
se
provision
in
the
--
in
the
membership
clause.
either,
it's
membership
with
knowledge
and
intent.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
he
--
that
mr.
--
that
general
taylor
would
argue
that
there
is,
in
effect
a
provision
that
you
can
no
longer
prove
a
communist
guilty
of
--
guilty
under
the
membership
clause,
because
he
says
they
wanted
to
--
they
wanted
to
protect
the
internal
security
act.
i
say
that
on
the
clarity
of
reasons
--
reasoning,
he
would
have
to
say
that
you
could
no
longer
prove
a
communist
guilty
under
(a).
this
is
--
this
isn't
what
congress
intended.
congress
intended
that
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
establish
the
crime
in
(a)
or
(c)
or
as
far
as
that
goes,
you
shouldn't
establish
the
time
in
the
membership
clause
either
by
merely
proving
membership
and
stopping
there.
you
have
to
do
something
more.
but
they
didn't
mean
by
that
--
that
the
membership
clause
was
to
be,
in
effect,
repealed
as
to
communist
party
members.
they
merely
meant
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
prove
something
more
than
membership
per
se
in
order
to
prove
--
in
order
to
prove
guilt
just
as
they
did
with
(a)
and
--
(a)
and
(c).
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
they've
just
--
they
couldn't
--
i
think
they
couldn't
have
before
either.
but
i
mean
it's
conceivable
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
no
one
could
claim
in
connection
with
the
internal
security
act
that
it
was
unconstitutional
because
you
could
prove
a
violation
of
(a)
by
coming
in
and
proving
membership.
and
it's
conceivable
that
that
argument
would
have
been
made,
because
the
view
of
the
nature
of
the
party
and
everything,
membership
might,
itself,
have
been
argued
to
constitute
a
violation
of
(a).
the
congress
said
you
shall
not
be
able
to
prove
(a)
or
(c)
on
membership
merely
by
stopping,
by
showing
the
man's
name
is
on
the
list
and
stopping
there.
you've
got
to
go
ahead
and
prove
knowledge
and
whatever
other
elements
are
required
to
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
true.
that
is
--
that
is
right.
sometimes
it
is
an
agreement
as
in
the
ordinary
conspiracy
situation
whereas
they
talk
about
agreement
itself
and
sometimes,
it
can
be
broader
from
the
term
agreement.
it
can
be
membership,
we
believe,
as
--
and
as
judge
parker
believed.
the
fact
that
they
didn't
really
intend
to
write
communist
membership
out
of
smith
act
is
shown,
i
think,
by
the
second
sentence
which
proceeds
to
imply
that
in
any
further
prosecutions
under
the
smith
act,
you
shall
not
be
able
to
introduce
an
evidence
as
evidence
against
the
defendant,
the
fact
that
he
has
--
he's
been
registered
under
the
internal
security
act.
it
seems
that
it
did
--
it's
written
it
out
that
these
--
they
wouldn't
contemplated
the
use
of
the
evidence
thereafter
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
that
it
was
put
in
without
this
particular
section
in
mind.
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
--
i
know
of
no
legislative
history
with
respect
to
17.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
that
it's
printed
in
--
in
any
of
the
papers
before
you.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
printed
in
the
petition
in
the
--
it's
printed
in
the
petition
in
the
communist
party
case
but
not
printed
in
--
it's
not
printed
in
our
brief.
we
relied
on
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
its
supplemental
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
mr.
--
general
taylor
has
three
briefs
which
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
find
it
within
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it's
not
printed
in
--
in
anything
that
i
--
i
--
the
--
the
language
is
very
simple
and
short.
it
says,
"the
foregoing
provisions
of
this
subchapter
shall
be
construed
as
being
in
addition
to
and
not
in
modification
of
existing
criminal
statutes."
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
negative.
i
think
it's
an
indication
of
what
the
congressional
intent
was.
but
i
--
i
--
72
--
if
you'll
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
now,
we
find
it.
we
printed
it
but
not
on
the
statute.
it's
at
page
72
of
the
only
brief
which
we
have
here.
it's
quoted
at
--
as
i
say
on
page
70
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
know
of
--
i
think
they
had
the
smith
act
specifically
in
mind.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
they
had
the
provision
dealing
with
--
probably,
all
the
provisions
of
it
including
the
advocacy
provision,
the
conspiracy
provision,
which
was
then
in,
and
the
membership
clause.
they
were
saying
that
none
of
the
provisions,
in
effect,
none
of
the
provisions
of
the
smith
act
can
be
established
merely
by
approving
membership
per
se.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
smith
act
probably
never
--
never
said
that,
never
intended
that
anyway.
the
smith
act,
as
far
as
--
as
conspiracy
to
advocate,
had
other
elements
as
far
as
organizing
to
and
as
far
as
advocacy
itself.
it
had
other
elements
in
it.
but
--
so
that
i
do
not
believe
one
--
even
before
this
was
passed,
one
could've
established
guilt
under
the
smith
act
by
merely
introducing
evidence
of
--
of
membership.
mr.
john
f.
davis
4
(f).
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
right.
it's
--
it
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
the
same
as
it
applies
to
section
(a)
and
(c)
of
the
internal
--
of
4
itself.
it
means
that
in
construing
these
sections
and
--
and
no
one
shall
be
able
to
claim
that
you
can
prove
a
violation
by
membership
alone.
you
shall
have
to
go
further
in
proving
a
violation
of
subsection
(a)
or
(c)
or
the
advocacy
clause
of
the
smith
act
or
any
of
those.
you
have
to
go
further
in
proving
them
than
merely
introducing
evidence
as
in
membership.
and
the
reason
they
were
doing
that,
it
sounds
silly
if
you
--
if
you
do
it
just
in
the
blue,
but
the
reason
they
were
doing
that
was
in
order
that
no
one
could
attack
the
statute
which
they
were
passing
as
proving
--
as
establishing
a
crime.
they
didn't
want
anyone
to
be
able
to
say,
"you're
passing
an
act
which
itself
makes
them
confess
to
some
other
crimes."
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
the
--
the
--
there
was
--
the
letter
from
then
attorney
general
as
well
as
--
as
other
criticism
of
the
act
on
the
ground
that
--
by
--
by
john
w.
davis
specifically,
calling
to
their
attention
that
they
would
trending
on
dangerous
ground
in
requiring
registration,
because
they
were
--
they
might
be
--
it
might
be
argued
that
they
were
requiring
people
to
confess
with
the
crime.
and
in
order
to
meet
this,
these
--
these
sections
were
written
into
the
--
into
the
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
you
can
still
claim
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
the
situation
like
this
if
--
i
mean
if
they
haven't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
there
is
still
a
claim
that
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
still
a
claim
that
the
communist
control
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
requires
--
in
closure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
claims
that
would
be
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
it's
--
that's
--
that's
really
the
question.
i'm
sure
they
didn't
intend
to
repeal
the
smith
act,
and
the
question
is
did
they
inadvertently
do
it?
was
--
it
is
an
inevitable
result
of
this,
whether
they
wanted
to
do
it
or
not
is
the
inevitable
result
of
this
to
repeal
the
--
the
membership
clause.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
repealed
it
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
(inaudible)
that's
right.
these
are
the
criminal
statutes
and
--
and
we
must
--
we
must
read
them
as
they
are
written.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
can't
say
that
it's
--
it's
too
bad
they
made
a
mistake.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
this
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
i
--
if
i
recollect
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
they
--
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
intending
to
give
anyone
immunity
from
registration.
they
were
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
intending
that
no
one
could
avoid
registration.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
was
a
specific
intention
that
the
registration
should
not
itself
be
used
against
them,
that
they
--
this
could
not
be
used
in
a
criminal
trial.
and
there
was,
secondly,
the
suggestion
that
whether
or
not
you
use
the
registration
that
the
fact
of
registration
should
not
be
used
as
proof
but
--
of
the
--
of
the
substantive
crime.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
have
reviewed
that
upon
the
(inaudible)
the
reference
to
his
own
specific
position
on
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
that
mr.
celler
would
particularly
concern
with,
in
effect,
to
the
whole
idea
of
requiring
a
--
the
registration
with
respect
to
the
--
the
communist
party
and
the
members
thereof.
and
he
--
he
certainly
didn't
want
any
crime
to
be
proved,
to
be
established
through
the
facts
which
will
require
than
the
registration.
he
wanted
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
--
that
the
back
of
registration
shouldn't
be
enough
to
prove
a
crime
under
(a),
(c)
or
the
--
or
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
the
final
language
came
out
of
the
conference
committee,
as
i
remember
it,
where
they
put
in
both
the
fact
that
they
shouldn't
use
the
--
shouldn't
use
the
evidence
and
the
provision
saying
that
it
shouldn't
be
--
it
--
it
shouldn't
be
a
crime
by
itself.
as
i
recollect
it
that
came
out
of
the
conference
between
the
senate
and
the
house
itself.
but
i'll
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
check
on
that,
your
honor,
and
this
--
this
problem
would
be
up
in
the
next
case
and
i
will
give
you
a
more
specific
answer
to
it
on
mr.
celler's
statement
in
--
in
the
conference
committee,
when
it
comes
up
in
noto
which
is
the
case
immediately
followed
on
that.
we
come
then
to
the
questions
of
the
construction
of
the
membership
clause
itself
and
its
constitutionality.
in
these
--
with
respect
to
these,
we
are
referring
to
--
specifically
to
the
questions
asked
by
the
court
in
its
order
setting
the
case
down
for
reargument.
these
questions
are
reprinted
on
pages
1
and
2
of
the
government's
brief.
and
the
first
question
is
whether
the
statutes
can
be
sustained
even
if
construed
not
to
require
either
intent
or
activity.
now,
we
had
thought
in
view
of
the
court's
holding
in
the
dennis
case
that
this
question
was
not
open
to
us,
because
we
thought
that
it
was
pretty
well
decided
by
this
court
in
the
dennis
case
that
intent
should
be
read
into
these
provisions
of
the
smith
act.
and
in
fact,
i
--
i
still
believe
that
--
that
this
is
a
proper
construction
of
the
--
of
the
smith
act.
but
assuming
for
a
moment
that
it's
impossible
to
read
intent
or
activity,
you
know
it,
and
we
have
to
have
the
statutes
just
as
--
as
membership
in
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
of
its
illegal
aims.
is
that
--
is
it
constitutional,
is
it
constitutional
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
punish
such
action?
well,
there's
--
there's
certainly
authority
to
support
the
fact
that
it
is
constitutional.
this
court
in
bryant
against
zimmerman,
278
united
states
63
upheld
the
new
york
statutes,
which
punished
membership
in
the
ku
klux
klan
as
such,
felt
that
membership
in
an
organization,
an
illegal
organization
with
knowledge
of
that
organization's
aim
was,
itself,
punishable.
whitney
against
california,
274
united
states
357
involves
a
california
statute,
which
punished
organization
and
membership,
and
there
was
there
a
single
count
indictment
alleging
both.
so
that
in
effect,
in
upholding
that
statute,
the
supreme
court
was
upholding
a
statute
with
respect
to
ownership,
i
think,
with
respect
to
membership
alone.
i
think
that
judge
parker's
statement
in
frankfeld
against
the
united
states,
one
of
the
smith
act
cases,
states
my
position
about
as
well
as
it
can
be
stated.
he
says,
"membership
in
an
organization
renders
aid
and
encouragement
to
the
organization,
and
when
membership
is
accepted
or
retained
with
knowledge
that
the
organization
is
engaged
in
an
unlawful
purpose,
the
one
accepting
or
retaining
membership
with
such
knowledge
makes
himself
a
party
to
the
unlawful
enterprise
in
which
he
is
engaged."
in
other
words,
membership
is
an
indirect
way
of
carrying
on
the
advocacy
which
the
party
carries
on.
by
being
a
member,
by
supporting
the
organization,
by
lending
one's
--
one's
moral
support
or
whatever
other
supports
involved
in
membership
to
an
organization
with
these
purposes
is
making
a
contribution
to
the
purposes
of
the
organization.
remembering,
of
course,
that
it
must
be
done
with
knowledge
of
the
aims
of
the
organization,
then
it
should
be
unnecessary
to
prove
intent
because
the
--
the
intent
almost
follows
the
matter
of
--
of
course
that
whether
or
not
it
does,
there
is
this
aid
and
encouragement
to
the
advocacy
whether
intent
is
present
or
is
not
present.
now,
the
second
question
is
whether
or
not
the
statute
construed
to
require
intent,
but
presumably
not
activity,
whether
with
--
when
you
add
the
element
of
intent,
you
aid
in
--
in
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
well,
i
may
say
that
judge
hand
in
the
dennis
case,
and
in
this
court's
opinion
in
dennis
case,
apparently
felt
that
reading
intent
into
this
--
into
this
statute
does
aid
in
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
act,
because
in
both
of
this
--
in
both
of
this
opinions,
both
judge
hand
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
dennis
case,
it
was
felt
that
intent
was
a
very
important
element,
and
that
reading
the
--
and
that
it
--
that
it
aided
in
--
in
reaching
the
--
the
--
in
tying
up
the
--
the
individual
with
the
organization
making
the
nexus
clear
so
as
to
--
so
that
one
wouldn't
be
punishing
one
man
for
something
which
an
organization
did.
and
there
was
seemed
to
be
a
little
difficulty
reached
by
either
judge
hand
who
dealt
with
it
in
a
page
and
a
half
in
this
court
that
dealt
with
it
just
about
as
previous
as
a
span
in
finding
that
congress
intended
that
intent
was
an
element
of
this
crime.
mr.
john
f.
davis
conspiracy
case,
yes,
the
conspiracy
to
advocate
or
conspiracy
to
--
to
organize
a
--
that
--
that
is
true.
it's
all
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
in
the
--
in
the
conspiracy
field.
but
the
organization
--
i
think
that
they're
reading
intent
into
organization
as
well
as
into
conspiracy,
because
they
were
not
dealing
that
was
conspiracy
to
commit
this
crime
of
organizing,
and
i
think
intent
is
read
into
the
organizing
and
--
and
as
well
as
into
the
conspiracy
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
element
that
what
should
be
called
an
element
of
activity.
i
think
we've
reached
this
problem
of
activity
because
there
was
--
there
was
a
feeling
that
could
congress
have
possibly
meant
that
if
somebody's
name
appeared
on
a
list,
communist
list,
and
no
proof
of
anything
else,
could
congress
possibly
have
meant
that
this
person
should
be
guilty
of
a
crime?
as
the
court
in
its
instructions
said,
what
if
it's
merely
passive
membership,
what
if
it's
negative.
there's
no
--
there's
no
proof
that
he
did
anything.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
knowledge
of
purpose
may
well
been
reached
through
reading
the
classics
discussions,
it
can
be
reached
in
any
--
in
any
noun
or
maybe
an
individual
will
have
engaged
in
activities
which
have
the
same
aims
as
the
communist
party
and
so
he
is
aware
of
what
communist
party
is
engaged
in.
and
in
one
way
or
another,
he
has
this
knowledge
as
to
what
the
party
is.
but
--
but
the
question
which
bothered
us
and
why
the
activity
came
in
to
it
is,
what
if
he
never
--
never
did
anything
as
a
member?
maybe
he
never
even
made
a
formal
application
for
membership,
maybe
his
name
was
put
on
the
list.
he's
--
he's
a
member
in
name
only
but
he
does
have
the
knowledge,
can
this
be
--
can
this
be
what
congress
had
in
mind?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
quite
properly,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that
depends
on
--
on
the
definition
of
membership.
and
we
had
felt
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
using
the
word
"member"
to
mean
just
this
--
just
that
part.
we
felt
that
congress
meant
that
he
should
take
some
action
as
a
member.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
nobody
ever
comes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
comes
closer
to
it
but
i'd
be
--
never
if
he
had
actually
never
paid
dues,
never
attended
a
meeting,
his
name
is
merely
been
on
a
--
on
a
standby
list
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
here
is
--
there
was
some
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
this
is
a
very
definite
contribution
to
the
--
to
the
party's
aim.
i
mean
that
communist
party
needs
money
like
any
other
organization,
and
this
is
a
--
a
definite
act
contributing
to
its
--
to
its
aim.
and
this
--m
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
brings
this
closest
to
member
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
--
this
is
so
but
in
meeting
these
questions
of
membership
before
this
court
has
had
read
intent
into
them,
i
mean
when
we
--
when
we
read
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
activity
can
--
there
are
all
degrees
of
activity
and
you
can
have
some
very
difficult
questions
about
how
far
you'd
go
but
--
if
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
let
me
--
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
where
--
where
we
felt
it
would
be
unfortunate
membership
would
--
would
result
in
punishment.
take
thayer
against
spratt,
where
these
people
had
joined
an
organization
which
they
thought,
for
some
reason
or
another,
would
promote
their
aims.
aims
that
the
organization
have
changed
without
--
they
were
foreigners,
they
were
--
they
--
i
don't
know
how
many
have
spoke
the
language.
they
were
members,
they
were
carried
on
the
party
roles,
they
have
--
they've
purposely
become
members,
but
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
new
organization.
they
weren't
active
and
they
knew
nothing
about
what
was
going
on.
we
felt
that
pure
membership
in
this
case
maybe
one
would've
done
it
on
intent
on
that
case
too.
but
in
that,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
way
to
tie
them
in
and
if
you
do
have
people
who
are
performing
acts
for
the
thing,
then
--
then
you
--
you
don't
have
that
--
that
difficulty
of
the
connection
between
the
organization
and
the
individual.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
that
case,
they
talked
about
paying
dues
and
attending
meetings.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
--
in
the
rowoldt
case,
that's
right.
in
galvan
against
press
which
was
the
--
the
case
which
rowoldt
interpreted,
in
galvan
against
press,
then
the
question
was
whether
or
not
he
really
did
anything,
whether
he
attended
meeting,
paid
dues,
or
he
knew
wat
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
both
activity
and
intent
are
necessary.
if
you
--
if
we
have
merely
--
merely
intent,
we
--
we
get
into
more
difficult
questions
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
whether
or
not
we
are
punishing
this
man
for
something
that
somebody
else
does.
if
you
don't
have
any
activity
at
all,
the
question
is
whether
you're
not
trying
to
punish
a
member
not
for
what
he
has
done
but
for
what
someone
else
has
done.
and
the
old
--
the
old
cases
with
respect
to
constructive
treason,
a
--
a
pretty
strong
that
in
this
thought
of
field,
you
want
to
read
the
statutes
so
that
person,
you
can
bring
home
to
him
something
which
he
himself
has
done.
now,
membership
maybe
in
a
sense
an
act,
i
mean
certainly
if
a
man
files
an
application
and
it's
accepted
and
he
acknowledged
that
he's
a
member,
that's
an
act
and
we
don't
really
have
any
trouble
about
being
an
absent
of
an
act,
but
communist
party
doesn't
come
about
through
and
lots
of
these
organizations
don't
come
about
through
formal
filing
of
applications
and
sending
a
membership.
so
that
congress
very
reasonably
could
have
intended
that
when
it
used
the
word
"membership"
that
it's
meant
membership
in
an
active
sense.
and
i
think
that
the
court
won't
be
going
far
afield
in
--
in
reaching
such
an
interpretation
certainly
when
--
well,
when
it
came
to
this
--
to
the
--
the
anticommunist
oath
in
the
labor
field.
there,
the
question
was,
what
did
belief
mean.
congress
had
to
--
the
court
had
to
determine
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
the
word
"belief
in".
and
the
court
had
no
difficulty
in
construing
belief
in
as
being
adhering
to
and
approving
rather
than
just
an
abstract
idea
that
they
understood
and
--
and
gave
their
general
approval
to
it.
so
we
feel
that,
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
term
"membership",
this
court
may
well
find
that
congress
intended
the
word
to
mean
active
membership.
and
that
was
that
construction,
the
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
is
--
is
considerably
bolstered.
however,
even
if
--
even
if
we
do
not
mix
this
as
a
matter
of
construction,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
can
be
considered
that
in
its
application
to
this
case,
we
can
consider
that
here
we
are
applying
it
to
an
active
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
that
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
in
this
case
with
how
it
may
be
applied
in
some
other
case.
this
is
what
we
mean
by
saying
that
if
it
is
constitutional
in
its
application
to
men
like
scales,
then
we
don't
--
don't
need
to
consider
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
if
it
were
applied
to
men
like
the
aliens
who
were
involved
in
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
we
don't
have
that
case
before
us.
and
just
as
in
the
--
in
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine,
we
consider
whether
or
not
the
application
of
the
statute
is
to
a
situation
where
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger,
and
if
so,
uphold
it.
so
here,
when
it
is
applied
to
a
situation
where
you
have
an
active
member,
as
scales
was,
you
need
not
consider
what
the
situation
would
be
if
it
were
applied
in
some
other
context.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
it
--
it
would
--
it
would
be
done
as
--
as
we've
done
last
term
and
in
connection
with
the
civil
rights
statutes
where
the
application
in
that
case
was
to
voting
officials
in
the
state.
and
although
the
statute
itself
wasn't
specifically
limited
to
those
voting
officials,
the
court
said,
"we'll
consider
the
constitutionality
of
this
act
in
connection
with
its
application
as
it
is
here
rather
than
as
so
the
government
was
trying
to
enforce
it
with
respect
to
--
to
some
others."
and
this
is
--
this
is
all
that
we
are
suggesting
here
that
if
it
is
impossible,
and
i
do
not
know
if
it
should
be,
but
if
it
is
impossible
to
reach
this
matter
through
interpretation,
it
can
be
reached
through
a
matter
of
what
a
constitutional
application
of
the
statute
would
be,
and
this
court
can
announce
what
that
application
would
be.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
is
not
in
the
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this,
i
think,
is
merely
a
question
--
i
--
i
mean
it's
a
questions
of
definition.
what
is
active
in
other
words?
and
my
--
my
suggestion
is
that
any
affirmative,
and
i
use
the
word
"act",
i
don't'
know
what
else
to
use,
any
affirmative
act
which
is
made
which
he
performs
as
a
part
--
as
--
as
a
member,
acquire
member
rather
than
as
someone
else,
will
sufficient
to
make
him
an
active
member.
mr.
john
f.
davis
paying
of
dues
most
certainly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
paying
of
dues
that
--
that
would
be
an
--
being
an
active
member.
it's
a
very
--
it's
a
very
important
function
to
pay
dues.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
that
that
is
right.
i
would
think
that
would
tie
his
own
personal
activity
with
the
--
with
the
party
then.
mr.
john
f.
davis
would
also
be
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
is
true.
yes.
attendance
of
meeting
or
certainly
continued
attendance
of
meetings
would
--
would
be
certainly
activity,
but
the
de
jonge
case
is
--
is
a
very
different
case.
there,
the
statute
proscribed
assisting
and
--
and
conducting
meetings.
and
that
was
--
that
was
the
statute
which
the
man
was
indicted
onto.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
he
actually
did
that.
and
it
was
held
that
there
was
an
infringement
of
the
first
amendment
to
--
there
was
nothing
illegal
done
in
the
meeting.
it
was
--
the
meeting
was
sponsored
by
--
by
a
subversive
organization.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
meeting
itself
made
no
advocacy.
and
he
was
--
he
was
not
a
member.
he
wasn't
accused
of
being
a
member
at
any
rate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
wasn't
--
but
he
wasn't
indicted
for
being
a
member.
he
was
indicted
for
participating
in
a
meeting
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
which
was
an
innocent
public
meeting.
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
unless
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
unless
you
read
membership
as
requiring
activity.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
certainly
think
that
this
would
not
be
activity
within
this
--
within
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
this
is
not
limited
to
--
to
members.
this
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
--
with
membership.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
well,
even
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
but
this
is
not
acting
as
a
member
--
i
mean
anybody
--
this
is
not
an
act
which
is
peculiar
to
a
member
in
other
words.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
can
certainly
be
action
but
it's
not
action
which
is
characteristically
limited
to
the
members
of
the
party.
i
mean
if
any
--
it's
something
which
anybody
can
do
in
--
in
this
--
in
this
field
and
which
everybody
--
in
which
they
will
do
regularly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
in
the
sense
that
i
am
suggesting
because
i
am
suggesting
that
these
acts
are
acts
which
are
peculiar
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
membership
and
to
recommend
people
that
they
vote
for
a
communist
candidate.
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
--
this
is
common
to
--
i
mean
to
--
to
urge
people
to
vote
in
one
way
or
another,
isn't
limited
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
the
person
being
a
member
of
the
party.
i
mean
this
is
a
discussion
of
a
pubic
issue
on
--
if
they
felt
--
and
the
communist
--
it's
very
possible
that
many
people
urged
election
of
the
communist
candidates
even
though
they
were
not
members
of
the
party
because
they
were
members
of
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
farm
labor
groups
or
something.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no,
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
because
--
well,
let
me
--
let
me
suggest
this.
there
were
five
elections
in
which
communist
candidates
were
actually
nominated
and
voted
and
people
were
voted
--
voted
for
them.
now,
i
don't
have
--
i
did
have
but
i
don't
have
in
mind
the
number
of
votes
but
the
number
of
votes
for
these
communist
candidates
was
somewhat
larger
than
the
number
of
--
members
of
the
party
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
if
you
take
it
from
the
end
of
--
from
the
field
of
electioneering
to
the
field
of
voting,
you
find
that
people
supported
these
communist
candidates
because
they
believe
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice.
when
we
arose
for
lunch,
we
were
discussing
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
read
the
word
membership
as
including
an
element
of
activity.
and
i
was
having
a
little
difficulty
with
the
question
from
mr.
justice
black
about
whether
soliciting
votes
for
a
communist
candidate
could
be
considered
activity.
and
the
obvious
trouble
that
i
get
into
one,
this
question
is
that
soliciting
votes
or
voting
for
--
for
communist
candidates,
its
obviously
a
protected
right,
constitutionally
protected
right.
and
that
i'm
almost
automatically
in
trouble
if
i
argue
that
by
proving
that
a
man
did
something
which
is
constitutionally
protected
in
doing
that
he
can
subject
himself
to
punishment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
that
to
solicit
votes
for
a
regularly
nominated
candidate
of
a
political
party
in
the
election
campaign
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
i
think
that
there's
no
question
about
it.
if
--
it
is
--
i
think
that
it
--
under
any
definition,
it
is
activity
and
it
is
probably
party
activity.
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
would
ever
held
--
hold
that
it
is
the
kind
of
activity
which
would
subject
the
man
punishment.
that
case
isn't
before
us.
we
--
we've
--
i'm
--
i'm
glad
to
say.
and
it
would
lead
to
that
--
to
that
further
difficulty.
the
kind
of
activities
that
i
am
talking
about
however
are
not
of
particularly
of
that
nature.
they
are
acts,
not
illegal
acts.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
have
to
prove
illegal
acts
but
they
are
affirmative
acts
which
a
man
takes
in
order
to
--
as
part
of
his
membership.
and
when
you
tie
those
in
with
knowledge
as
to
the
aims
of
the
party
and
his
intent
that
these
aims
shall
be
brought
to
provision
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
try
the
man
in
with
a
--
with
an
--
with
an
offense
which
can
be
punished
under
the
constitution.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
as
a
--
as
a
national
political
party,
the
communist
party
that
they
themselves
in
there
and
they're
teaching
of
--
in
their
analysis,
distinguish
their
activities
into
their
legal
activities
and
their
illegal
activities,
if
you
please.
mr.
foster
writes
that
the
purpose
of
the
party
is
to
achieve
their
aims
through
democracy
and
for
five
years
they
nominated
candidates.
these
were
legal
activities
and
the
--
the
party
for
--
for
years
did
conduct
this
kind
of
--
of
legal
activity.
i
don't
think
that
insofar
as
an
individual
promoted,
if
it
were
possible,
promoted
only
these
legal
activities,
had
no
intention,
no
knowledge
about
the
illegal
activities,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
then
you've
come
down
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
clear
and
present
danger
in
that
kind
of
a
--
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger,
then
it
can
be
a
crime
but
i
think
under
--
under
the
state,
upon
the
facts
that
you
give
me.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
there
would
be
no
clear
and
present
danger
if
the
communist
party
behaved,
if
you
please,
the
way
karl
max
behaved
and
said
we
believe
in
--
in
--
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
we
believe
that
the
proletarian
has
to
take
over
and
(inaudible)
have
to
be
thrown
out
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
do
and
that's
our
platform
and
we
will
--
and
we
want
as
much
support
as
we
can.
i
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
in
the
--
in
the
field
of
free
speech
and
that
can
be
met
by
free
speech.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
conspiratorial
group
such
as
the
communist
party
is
to
say
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
withdraw
conspiratorial.
if
a
group
such
as
the
communist
party
as
today
that
teaches
its
members
in
school
after
school
various
violent
methods
of
overthrow
just
because
it
conducts
even
if
it
did
conduct
as
i've
supposed,
the
communist
party
does
too,
some
legal
activities
on
the
side.
even
though,
let
us
say,
one
of
those
legal
activities
were
and
it
isn't
at
the
present
time.
but
even
supposing
one
of
those
legal
activities
were
the
nomination
and
election
and
seeking
to
elect
the
president,
i
don't
think
that
they
can
quote
that
they
can
get
protection
for
their
illegal
activities
because
they
have
a
legal
side.
mr.
john
f.
davis
would
be
illegal?
mr.
john
f.
davis
without
--
without
payment
or
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
a
commendation?
mr.
john
f.
davis
would
it
be
outlawed?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
what
the
party
could
constitutionally
be
an
--
outlawed
if
that
was
the
extent
of
what
it
was
doing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
in
the
situations
which
you're
giving
me
sir,
we
do
not
have
the
--
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
that
you'd
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
where
it
comes
in.
that's
where
the
importance
of
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
doctrine
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
i
think
because
i
think
that
you
do
have
there
on
advocacy
of
violent
overthrow
of
violent
or
unconstitutional
means.
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
these
people
come
out
and
lay
--
and
lay
this
before
the
public.
if
this
is
a
political
issue,
then
it
can
be
met
through
political
means.
but
when
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
there
has
been
and
i
don't
think
that
is
this
law
either,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
well,
this
can
be
done
only
in
a
situation
where
--
where
there
is
--
is
on
this
phrase
that
when
the
--
the
phrase
that's
been
--
it's
been
reworked
so
that
--
i'm
not
sure
that
(inaudible)
would
rec
--
recognize
this
act
but
only
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
clear
and
present
danger.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
but
i
think
that
our
difficulty
in
applying
that
to
the
present
situation
is
that
we
do
not
have
what's
a
--
we
do
not
have
a
problem
where
they're
outlawed
electing
officers
or
elect
--
trying
to
elect
(voice

--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
they
can
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right
and
--
and
as
for
that
element
of
it,
as
to
whether
you
can
prevent
them
from
nominating
officials
and
so
forth
that's
a
matter
which
will
--
is
involved
although
it
--
in
the
communist
control
act
although
i
don't
think
it
will
be
involved
in
the
case
as
it
comes
up
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
membership
with
this
intent
and
--
and
probably
shouldn't
get
very
far
if
there's
a
clear
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
present
danger.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
its
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
get
first
the
question
of
the
incitement
whether
the
party
is
advocating,
that
is
inciting
to
action.
that's
the
first
question.
is
the
party
inciting
people
to
action,
we
believe
to
(voice

--
mr.
john
f.

pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
sure
they
all
do.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
(voice

--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
are
--
i
--
i
think
this
goes
more
--
it
goes
beyond
illegality.
this
is
the
ultimate
in
illegality
when
it
is
the
overthrow
of
the
government
itself
-
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
by
force
and
violence
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
mr.
--
that
--
i
mean
there
are
revolutions
and
--
and
that
--
but
this
is
--
the
question
is,
does
the
sovereign
--
does
a
sovereign
state,
can
make
it
a
crime
for
people
try
and
overthrow
it
and
i
certainly
think
that
it's
a
--
mr.
john

davis
--
appropriate
for
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
great
britain
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
here
we
have
advocacy,
here.
yes,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
mean,
this
is
one
step
back
but
the
--
when
you
say
that
party
that's
advocating
illegality,
i
say
this
its
not
only
a
question
of
an
illegal
action
but
this
is
the
ultimate
in
illegality
of
overthrowing
the
law
giver
that
--
that
(voice

--
mr.
john
f.

well,
it's
in
the
same
family
history.
mr.
john
f.

but
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
this
is
a
--
this
in
--
instead
of
being
individual
action
as
a
group
which
a
group
which
is
found
to
--
to
advocate.
mr.
john
f.

well,
political
party,
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
states.
mr.
john
f.
davis
state
--
mr.
john
f.

that
is
true.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
i
--
i
--
(voice

--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
some
proof
of
--
there
--
there
is
--
there
--
there
is
--
there
are
problems
under
the
communist
control
act
and
the
internal
security
act
of
outlawing,
so-called
outlawing
parties
which
we
don't
have
in
this
case.
we
have
in
this
case
of
course
only
the
provisions
of
the
smith
act
in
connection
with
advocating
and
membership.
now
your
honor
is
quite
right,
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
an
organization
can
continue
if
--
if
you
can
punish
all
members
and
indirectly
we
have
the
same
effect
but
the
impetuous,
the
--
that
the
point
of
impact
in
this
case
is
on
the
individual
rather
than
on
the
party,
rather
than
outlawing
the
party.

oh
yes,
the

of
the

mr.
john

certainly.
mr.
john

that
is
--
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
punish
for
acts?
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
believe
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
advocating
is
an
act,
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
its
--
if
it
is
advocating
as
it's
define
in
--
in
the
yates
and
dennis
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
--
my
time
has
expired.
i
--
i
hadn't
intended
to.
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
any
questions
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
you
have.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
attempt
to
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
--
this
was
introduced
because
i
believe
it
was
used
down
in
north
--
distributed
down
at
north
carolina
are
in
this
copy.
i
believe
the
copy
of
this
was
given
to
one
of
the
witnesses
that
was
suppose
to
indicate
the
lines
of
--
of
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
propaganda.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
right.
well
there's
no
indication
that
that's
illegal.
there's
no
claim
that
that's
illegal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
just
an
indication
of
activities
that
they
were
engaged
and
many
of
the
activities
are
not
illegal.
they're
--
they're
--
but
if
--
if
the
party
is
engaged
in
distributing
this
material
and
if
this
person
engages
in
that
activity,
he's
doing
one
of
the
things
the
party
is
doing,
and
so,
it's
not
illegal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
illegal
in
distributing
that
pamphlet.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
that
too
is
not
illegal.
the
--
the
test
of
--
the
test
of
activity
which
i
am
suggesting
is
not
that
he
should
do
anything
illegal.
it
is
that
he
should
perform
some
voluntary,
physical
act
which
ties
him
in
with
--
with
the
party.
i
mean
so
that
he
won't
be
--
so
that
no
one
can
claim
that
he
is
being
punished
for
a
passive
state
but
paying
dues
for
example
is
not
illegal
but
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
party
members
do.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that's
activity
too,
its
not
illegal
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
activity.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
if
--
well,
there's
--
if
it
isn't
in
the
realm
of
this
--
of
the
same
constitutional
protection
although
there
isn't.
they're
out
of
constitutional
protection
but
if
the
question
isn't
whether
or
not
that
what
this
man
does
is
something
he
could
be
punished
for.
the
question
is
whether
he
does
anything
in
furtherance
of
the
party
aims.
and
if
the
party
is
holding
the
meeting
and
the
man
participates
in
the
meeting
then
he
is
--
he
is
active.
he
is
--
he
is
advancing
the
party
purposes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
ultimate
purpose,
we
understand
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
now
the
de
jonge
case
is
different
because
there,
there
wasn't
a
--
a
matter
of
prosecuting
a
man
for
belonging
to
a
subversive
organization.
there,
the
entire
crime
was
participating
in
a
meeting
ran
by
the
--
the
--
and
there
was
nothing
illegal
about
the
meeting.
the
nature
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
the
crime
that's
committed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
this
is
belonging
to
an
organizations
with
these
aims,
with
this
intent,
in
taking
his
membership
being
as
i
suggest,
activeness.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
in
the
de
jonge
case,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
statute
punishes
participating
in
a
meeting
and
when
there's
nothing
illegal.
it's
not,
wasn't
the
matter
of
it
being
a
member
of
the
party
and
this
meeting
was
entirely
innocent
in
it's
--
perfect
in
that
advocacy.
so
it's
--
then
it
said,
the
mere
fact
that
the
sponsor
of
the
meeting
was
the
subversive
organization
didn't
make
this
man
that
you
couldn't
punish
him
for
a
peaceful
meeting.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
--
i
said
that
the
party
--
these
cases
as
a
whole
have
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
--
of
the
dennis
case
but
i
think
the
de
jonge
case
is
--
not
changed
at
all
by
the
dennis
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that's
right
and
so
far
as
i
know,
it
was
never
--
it
wasn't
an
issue,
wasn't
argued
that
it
should
be
applied
in
that
case.
