mr.

general
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that's
entirely
negative
that
there
is
in
4
(f)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
first
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
but
what
--
to
what
act
would
they
refer
when
they
said,
"or
any
other
criminal
act"?
is
there
any
other
criminal
statute
if
they
did
not
refer
to
the
smith
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ut
what
--
what
provision
of
the
smith
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
modify
the
smith
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
your
position
then
that
section
17
--
no,
we
would
say
section
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
4
(f)
applies
to
the
smith
act
to
this
entirety
but
that
in
--
it
in
no
sense
modifies
because
of
--
of
section
17.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
anything
said
by
the
congressmen
who
were
in-charge
to
this
legislation
to
bear
that
out
or
to
bear
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
any
contrary
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
quite
a
difference,
wasn't
there,
between
the
--
the
way
4
(f)
started
than
the
way
it
ended?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
wasn't
that
due
to
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
current
--
between
the
senate
and
the
house
through
its
judiciary
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
what
was
the
--
what
was
that
the
house
advocated
in
order
to
bring
about
this
--
the
present
language?
were
they
doing
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
doing
it
for
the
raising
the
issue
for
the
question
of
immunity
to
bring
about
immunity
if
there
was
a
registration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
in
the
event
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
event
they
did
--
in
the
event
they
did
register,
was
there
no
intention
or
to
grant
an
immunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
position
of
the
congressman
celler,
then
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee,
do
you
recall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
don't
care
of
the
reference.
i
--
i
read
it
but
i
--
that's
what
i
--
i
just
wondered
what
--
what
you
--
what
you
thought
and
what
do
you
have
to
say
and
what
his
purpose
was
and
what
effect
of
that
on
the
--
on
the
section
as
it
now
stands?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
became
a
purpose
of
congress
for
passing
4
(f)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
want
to
say
--
i
don't
say
this
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
activity
is
a
necessary
ingredient.
mr.
davis,
but
what
is
the
standard
of
activity
that
would
you
inquire?
certainly,
it
isn't
in
the
act,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
--
what
would
be
your
definition
of
this
--
the
standard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'll
get
back
to
justice
frankfurter's
question,
paying
of
dues?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
enough?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
would
be
all
that
was
necessary
to
be
proved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
attendance
or
the
meeting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
that's
regardless
of
whether
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
was
for
--
for
criminal
purposes
or
innocent
purposes
as
in
de
jonge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
he
actually
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
admitted
in
the
court?
it
was
in
the
court
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
man
--
this
man
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
this
man,
scales,
has
not
been
indicted
for
activity
either.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
--
we
have
to
read
that
into
the
statute
--
into
the
statutes
to
know
if
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
--
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
difference
between
distributing
that
and
distributing
a
literature
in
favor
of
a
senator?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
they
made
speeches
at
the
--
at
a
communist
party
meeting
about,
well,
let's
say
some
clear
labor
matters,
the
things
of
that
kind,
is
that
activity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
that
--
is
--
that's
no
more
illegal,
you
say
that
--
than
the
advocate
--
advocating
candidacies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
the
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
--
no,
i
mean,
regard
--
regardless
of
the
--
what
is
said
and
done
at
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
meeting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
say
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
this
isn't
prosecuting
him
for
just
belonging
to
an
organization
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
either?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
all
those
things
were
conceded
in
the
de
jonge
case,
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
quarrel
at
all
with
the
de
jonge
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
--
that
have
to
give
weight
to
the
dennis
case
earlier
in
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
--
what
did
the
judge
instruct
in
that
regard?
