mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
under
what
is
known
as
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
the
case
has
been
here
before.
it
came
here
in
the
1956
term,
after
the
petitioner
had
been
tried
at
his
first
trial
and
convicted.
and,
at
that
time,
the
constitutional
and
statutory
questions
were
argued.
the
--
the
court
set
the
case
for
re-argument
at
the
beginning
of
the
1957
term.
but
before
it
was
reached,
the
jencks
case,
having
come
down
in
the
mean
time,
the
solicitor
general
confessed
error
under
the
jencks
case
and
this
court
reversed
in
a
short
per
curiam
opinion
on
the
authority
of
jencks,
leaving
those
constitutional
and
statutory
issues
untouched
that
we
had
argued
before.
the
case
was,
of
course,
remanded.
the
petitioner
has
now
been
tried
a
second
time.
he
has
been
convicted
again.
the
court
of
appeals
has
again
affirmed
and
the
case
is
again
here
on
certiorari.
the
principal
issues
that
were
argued
when
the
case
was
here
before
are
here
again
in
substantially
the
same
form.
there
are
also
some
important
new
issues
which
arise
chiefly
out
of
the
evidence
and
the
evidentiary
rulings
at
the
second
trial
and
out
of
the
intervening
decisions
of
this
court,
especially
in
the
yates
case.
and
i
will
come
to
some
of
those
new
questions
presently.
but,
i
would
like,
first,
if
i
may,
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statute
which
is
most
closely
involved
here,
the
membership
clause,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
page
2a,
because
the
wording
of
that
clause
and
its
setting
in
the
smith
act
as
a
whole
is
rather
critical
importance
to
almost
all
the
issues
that
we
have
to
deal
with
this
morning.
court
will
recall,
within
the
smith
act,
paragraphs
(1)
and
(3)
deal
with
advocacy
and
organizing.
and,
most
of
the
smith
act
prosecutions,
so
far,
have
been
for
conspiracy
to
violate
those
two
paragraphs.
those
are
the
ones
that
were
involved
in
the
dennis
case,
and
the
yates
case,
and
the
mesarosh
case,
and
the
other
smith
act
cases
that
have
been
here
before.
then,
in
paragraph
(3),
there's
a
second
clause
which
describes
“whoever
becomes
or
is
a
member
of
or
affiliates
with
any
such
society
group
or
assembly
of
persons
knowing
the
purposes
thereof
and
that
such
society
refers
back
to
a
group
which
teaches
or
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.”
now,
this
case
and
a
few
others,
pending
in
the
lower
federal
courts,
have
been
brought
under
that
clause.
one
of
them,
for
example,
was
up
here
as
a
companion
case
two
years
ago,
the
lightfoot
case,
and
reversed
on
the
same
ground
under
the
jencks
rule,
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
chicago,
and
is
pending
there.
and
has
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
another
one
is
the
noto
case
from
the
second
circuit
which
is
pending
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
now.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
lightfoot
case
has
not
been
tried
again.
it
was
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
noto
case,
justice
harlan,
was
tried
before
this
case
came
up
originally
has
been
pending
in
the
second
circuit
a
long
time.
there
are
several
others
that
we
have
listed
in
our
brief.
if
i
may
now
state
without,
at
this
point,
developing
the
two
major
issues
that
were
here
before
and
that
are
here
again,
the
first
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
on
its
face
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
that
clause
was
not
involved
in
the
dennis
and
yates
cases
and,
therefore,
it
has
not
yet
been
passed
on
here.
and,
secondly,
the
effect
on
the
membership
clause,
if
any,
of
section
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
enacted
10
years
later.
that's
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
pages
3a
to
4a,
and
that
says
that
neither
holding
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
shall
per
se
constitute
a
violation
of
any
criminal
statute.
now,
that
clause,
we
contend,
was
intended
to
be
and
it
is
a
bar
to
prosecutions
of
communists
under
the
membership
clause
and,
therefore,
the
indictment
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
state
--
state
an
offense.
the
new
questions
i
will
come
to
presently,
but
let
me
say
now
that
since
this
court
has
for
two
days
been
hearing
argument
revolving
around
the
jencks
case
and
18
u.s.c.
3500.
this
case
--
the
second
trial
in
this
case
was
after
both
the
jencks
decision,
of
course,
and
the
statute.
and,
the
trial
judge
followed
the
procedures
set
forth
in,
i
think
it's
paragraph
(c)
of
the
jencks
statute.
that
is
to
say,
he
examined,
in
camara,
reports
made
to
the
fbi
by
witnesses
of
the
government
and
excised
portions
that
he
deemed
irrelevant,
so
that
the
constitutionality
of
that
feature
of
3500
is
raised
here.
most
of
the
other
questions
that
the
court
has
been
concerned
with
the
last
two
days
are
not.
now,
a
word
about
the
facts
and
the
course
of
proceedings
are
heretofore
in
this
case.
the
indictment
is
important.
the
indictment
is
to
be
found
on
page
a2
of
the
record,
first
page
of
the
record.
the
court
will
see,
it
was
very
short
and
simple.
the
charge
is
that
the
communist
party
is
a
group
that
advocates
violent
overthrow
and
has
done
so
since
january
1946.
the
charge
is
that
the
defendant,
scales,
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and,
i
may
say,
that
that
--
the
fact
that
he
was
then
a
member
at
the
time
of
his
indictment
is
not
denied.
it's
charged
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
that
the
party
was
a
group
which
advocated
force
and
violence.
and,
finally,
it
is
charged
that
the
defendant
personally
intended
to
bring
about
governmental
overthrow.
that
last
charge
lies
outside
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
because
the
clause
does
not,
in
so
many
words
at
least,
comprehend
intent,
as
well
as
knowledge,
as
an
element.
now,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
at
his
first
trial
and
sentenced
to
six
years
imprisonment.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
it
was
reversed
here,
as
i've
already
stated.
the
second
trial
was
in
february
of
1958,
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago,
found
guilty,
sentenced
again
to
six
years
and
i
may
say
that,
so
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
only
sentence
under
the
smith
act
which
exceeds
five
years.
there,
of
course,
has
been
a
five-year-ceiling
on
conspiracy
convictions
until
recently
and
i
know
of
no
other
case
that
is
--
that
has
governed
this
sentence.
the
evidence
--
the
evidence
in
the
government's
case
is
summarized
in
the
briefs
and,
at
some
length,
in
the
government's
brief.
i
think,
at
this
point,
it
is
enough
to
say
that
the
government's
evidence
fell
under
two
general
categories.
there
was,
to
begin
with,
evidence
about
the
doctrinal
teachings
of
the
communist
party
which
was
presented,
for
the
most
part,
through
witnesses
who
did
not
know
the
defendant
had
never
seen
him
and
gave
no
testimony
touching
the
defendant
personally,
but
who
told
about
what
had
been
said
at
communist
meetings
in
various
parts
of
the
country,
largely,
statements
made
by
teachers
at
so-called
communist
schools
largely
in
the
1930s
and
1940s.
then,
the
balance
of
the
government's
case
was
largely
the
evidence
of
persons
who
had
joined
the
communist
party
as
informants
for
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
in
north
carolina
and
who
had
known
the
defendant
there
and
testified
about
his
activities
and
his
statements.
there
were
some
overlap
but,
generally
speaking,
that
was
the
scope
and
nature
of
the
case.
this
evidence
about
the
communist
party
as
to
whether
it
engages
in
the
proscribed
advocacy,
that
is
one
of
the
things
which
raises
important
new
questions
or
at
least
were
not
here
in
this
form
on
the
previous
occasion.
for
example,
in
the
yates
case,
it
was
held
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
made
in
that
case
in
los
angeles,
there
was
not
enough
to
conclude
that
the
communist
party
advocates
force
and
violence
in
the
sense
of
the
called
action.
that
it
--
and
that
it
did
not
engage
in
action
in
citing
advocacy
on
the
basis
of
the
record
made
there.
well,
the
question
arises,
was
there
anything
in
this
trial
in
greensboro
to
justify
coming
to
a
different
conclusion
about
the
communist
party
on
the
record
made
in
greensboro,
as
compared
to
the
record
made
in
los
angeles.
then,
another
important
question
arising
out
of
that
evidence,
we
contend
and
i
will
in
a
moment
develop,
that
some
of
the
new
evidence
offered
by
the
government
in
an
effort
to
meet
the
criteria
laid
down
in
the
yates
case
resulted
in
an
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
so
that
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
the
statute
is
not
void
on
its
face
that
it
had
been
unconstitutionally
applied
here
because
of
evidence
offered
and
rulings
made
thereon.
there
are
other
questions
in
the
case
which
i
will
mention,
if
time
permits
at
end,
but
i
think
that
those
i
have
described
are
the
major
problems.
now,
it
will
be
apparent
to
the
court
from
what
i've
said
so
far
that
there
are
issues
here
which,
if
our
position
is
sound,
would
warrant
reversal
without
touching
the
constitutional
issue.
at
the
same
time,
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
conviction
cannot
be
affirmed
unless
the
validity
on
its
face
of
the
membership
clause
is
upheld,
so
that
the
constitutionality
of
that
clause
it's
--
is
at
the
core
of
the
government's
case
and
is
basic
to
the
case
as
a
whole.
and,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
clause,
then
pass
to
its
constitutionality
as
applied
here,
and
then
discuss
the
effect
of
section
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
is
at
the
core
of
the
case
if
i
am
wrong
about
the
others,
your
honor.
mr.
telford
taylor
of
course,
i
hope
that
i'm
not
wrong
about
the
others.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
government
will
have
to
be
discussing
it
before
long,
your
honor,
and
so
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
of
it
now.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
must
persist
on
this
issue
at
this
time
and
before
passing
to
the
others.
mr.
telford
taylor
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
clause,
we
have,
in
our
brief,
tried
to
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
whatever
historical
background
there
is
on
this
which
may
be
pertinent.
it
is
an
unusual
statute
in
the
sense
that
it
attaches
criminal
consequences
to
association
by
membership.
there
have
been
a
few
precedence
but,
as
the
court
will
see
from
our
brief,
they
are
not
many
and
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
what
this
statute
undertakes
to
imbue
with
criminal
character.there
is
no
charge
that
the
defendant
advocated
violent
overthrow
or
anything
or
that
he
incited
anything.
there's
no
charge
of
organizing.
there
is
no
charge
of
conspiracy.
there
is
no
act
charged
except
for
remaining
a
member
of
the
party.
there
is
no
concert
of
action
or
agreement
with
anyone
else
charged.
there
is
nothing
but
membership
and
the
state
of
mind.
and,
we
suggest
that
the
constitutional
infirmities
under
the
first
amendment
are
pretty
plain
on
the
face.
whether
we
regard
these
as
restrictions
on
free
speech
or
on
freedom
of
assembly
might
perhaps
be
debated.
in
whitney
against
california,
justice
brandeis,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
seem
to
think
that
both
of
them
were
involved
when
he
was
analyzing
a
statute
somewhat
like
this
one,
and
he
expressed
very
grave
doubts
on
behalf
of
himself
and
justice
holmes
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
kind
of
attributing
criminality
to
association.
it
is
true
that
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
leans
the
other
way,
but
this
court
has
said
in
the
dennis
case
that
the
later
decisions
of
this
court
have
followed
the
rationale
of
the
holmes-brandeis
opinion
rather
than
the
majority
and,
of
course,
that
is
true.
the
holmes-brandeis
opinion
develops,
for
example,
the
incitement
versus
advocacy
distinction
that
was
developed
by
this
court
later
in
the
yates
case.
then,
two,
i
think
it's
plain
that
the
membership
clause
lacks
the
elements
that
this
court
relied
on
in
dennis
in
sustaining
the
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act.
there,
we
were
dealing
with
defendants
who
were
charged
with
conspiracy.
they
were
the
people
who
were
supposed
to
attach
this
conspiracy
in
1945
in
new
york.
the
danger
of
such
a
conspiracy
was
very
much
stressed
in
all
of
the
majority
opinions.
that's
not
present
here,
but
i
think
equally
compelling
are
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
government.
the
court
below
has
dealt
with
this
problem
simply
by
saying
that
conspiracy
is
the
same
thing
as
membership.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
it
said
there
at
my
brief
page
28.
the
membership
clause
is,
of
course,
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
statute
denouncing
and
making
criminal
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
well,
with
all
respect
to
the
learned
judge
who
wrote
that,
it
seems
to
me
utterly
untenable.
to
begin
with,
the
smith
act
does
not
punish
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government.
that's
accomplished
by
statutes
that
have
been
on
the
books
a
long
time,
since
the
war
between
the
states.
this
is
a
statute
touching
advocacy
and
that
is
why
the
first
amendment
is
brought
into
play.
then,
this
interpretation
simply
renders
the
membership
clause
redundant
duplicate
of
the
other
portions
of
the
smith
act.
nothing
is
left
of
it.
it
is
quite
true
again
that,
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
whitney
case,
there
are
some
remarks
that
might
be
used
to
buttress
this
view
that
membership
is
the
same
as
conspiracy.
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
brandeis'
opinion
is
very
clear
on
his
point
and,
even
if
he
had
not
done
this
task
for
us,
i
think
the
differences
between
conspiracy
and
membership
are
plain
enough.
you
have
to
charge
if
there
are
coconspirators.
you
have
to
name
them
if
you
know
the
names.
there
are
no
conspirators
named
here,
no
coconspirators.
there
has
to
be
an
agreement
in
pursuit
of
some
unlawful
objective
or
method.
there
is
no
agreement
charged
here.
under
the
statute,
in
federal
courts,
you
have
an
overt
act,
that's
not
here.
so,
none
of
those
elements
that
constitute
conspiracy,
that
are
part
of
the
safeguards
around
that
defense
are
present
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
wholly
impossible
to
simply
say
this
is
a
conspiracy
statute
and
punish
it
on
that
basis.
now,
the
government's
defense
of
this
statute
is
a
little
different.
they
like
the
result
reached
by
the
court
below,
but
there
seems
to
be
some
distrust
of
the
logic
because
they
have
gone
about
it
a
little
differently.
they
seek
to
save
the
statute
by
extensive
judicial
amendment
by
reading
into
the
statute
words
which
are
not
there.
in
our
reply
brief,
on
page
2,
we
have
set
forth
the
membership
clause
as
it
would
be,
if
you
read
into
it,
the
various
words
which
the
government
seeks
to
import.
i
might
say
that
one
word
they
import
is
left
out
of
there
and
that
is
“intent.”
it
is
arguable
that
intent
could
be
implied
into
the
statute.
we
think
not
for
reasons
given
in
the
brief,
but
even
if
that
hurdle
be
jumped
then
the
government
wishes
to
read
in
all
the
italicized
words
on
page
2
there,
so
it
would
read
“or
becomes
or
is
an
active
court
pursued,
rigidly
disciplined,
high-level
member
of
or
affiliates
with
any
tightly
disciplined
quasi-military,
deeply
conspirational
such
society.”
come
right
back
to
conspiracy
again,
not
quite
all
the
way
back
perhaps,
as
the
lower
court
did,
but
certainly
very
close
to
it.
well,
now,
i
think
that
method
simply
will
not
do.
what
the
government
has
done,
of
course,
is
to
confuse
what
may
be
proved
in
a
particular
case
about
an
individual
or
an
organization
with
what
may
be
read
into
the
statute
and
the
indictment.
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
indefensible
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
chief
justice
taft
has
had
something
to
say
about
this
sort
of
problem
years
ago.
he
called
this
making
the
statute
a
nose
of
wax.
he
was
dealing
with
an
identical
situation,
a
philippine
statute,
at
which
the
constitutionality
was
dubious.
the
council
made
efforts
to
amend
it,
just
as
is
being
done
here
by
reading
in
the
many
words
that
went
there,
and
this
was
the
phrase
that
justice
taft
--
chief
justice
taft
used
in
saying
that
would
not
do.
he
also
observed
that
the
words
that
are
in
the
statute
“or
affiliates
with,”
this
covers
not
only
membership
but
affiliation.
it's
clearly
suggest
to
me
that
congress
envisaged
getting
at
a
loser
sort
of
association
here
than
the
government
is
now
trying
to
confine
it
to.
well,
i
will
not
labor
the
arguments
on
constitutionality
further.
i
think
i
have
made
a
fair
and
full
statement
of
our
contentions
on
it,
and
i
would
now
like
to
pass
onto
the
new
issues
that
have
arisen
here
involving
the
constitutionality
as
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
seems
to
me,
the
--
certainly
quantitatively
and
qualitatively,
both.
this
is
a
rather
more
marked
departure,
but
i
would
have
to
say,
your
honor,
that
if
the
screws
case
read
as
much
in,
it
is
wrongly
decided,
but
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
amendments
here
are
really
not
trying
to
arrive
at
a
new
interpretation
of
words
that
are
there.
it
is
the
interlarding
of
many
more
words
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
all.
constitutionality
is
applied
here.
one
of
the
problems
arises
out
of
one
of
these
words
that
is
attempted
to
be
read
in
here,
the
word
“active.”
when
the
case
was
here
before,
the
solicitor
general,
in
his
supplemental
memorandum,
suggested
that
the
statute
should
be
applied
so
as
to
cover
only
active
membership
in
the
party.
i
think
justice
harlan,
you
had
considerable
colloquy
with
the
government
on
that
point
at
the
time.
in
that
memorandum,
they
suggested
that
this
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
in
the
sense
that
it
has
to
be
put
to
the
jury
and
found
by
the
jury,
but
is
what
they
call
an
overwriting
constitutional
limitation
to
be
found
by
the
judge.
well,
we
don't
think
that
much
can
be
said
for
that
view
but
how
that
might
be.
when
this
case
is
on
trial,
the
government
requested
that
the
jury
be
instructed.
they
couldn't
find
him
guilty
unless
he
were
found
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
party.
the
judge
did
not
make
this
finding,
the
jury
made
it.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
the
charge
is
in
the
--
is
in
the
front
of
the
record
there,
pages
839
to
841.
yes,
it's
on
page
841,
chief
justice
harlan.
it
was
first
determined
whether
he
was
an
active
member,
not
enough
that
he
simply
be
a
member.
now,
in
this
court,
the
solicitor
general
has
reverted
to
his
original
position
here
and
says
that
that
is
not
a
question
for
the
jury,
but
is
a
question
for
the
court,
what
clear
and
present
danger.
of
course
we
don't
think
that
the
word
should
be
read
into
the
statute.
we
don't
think,
if
it
were
read
into,
would
help
very
much
on
constitutionality
because,
as
the
yates
case
certainly
held,
activity
by
itself
is
insufficient
for
any
criminal
implications
here.
the
indictment
says
nothing
about
activity
and
we
made
timely
objection
to
the
failure
to
make
that
--
to
allege
that
element
if
the
government
were
going
to
rely
on
it
as
an
element
of
crime.
but,
all
this
now
seems
rather
academic
because
the
court
didn't
find
activity.
it
sent
it
to
the
jury
and,
so,
on
the
government's
own
theory,
there
was
error
committed
by
sending
it
to
the
jury.
the
situation
can
be
better
understood
in
the
light
of
the
noto
case,
pending
here,
which
was
tried
before
the
solicitor
general
espoused
the
activity
limitation
and,
therefore,
there
was
no
instruction
there
about
activity.
it
didn't
go
to
jury.
so,
there
is
a
problem
there.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
one
of
the
pitfalls
of
reading
into
a
statute,
words
--
after
a
case
have
been
tried,
words
that
aren't
there
and
can't
reasonably
be
implied.
now,
another
and
i
think
even
more
serious
problem
as
the
statute
as
applied
here
arises
out
of
the
evidence
introduced
to
meet
the
criteria
laid
down
in
the
yates
case.
the
court
said
in
the
yates
case
that
there
must
be
proof
of
advocacy
which
amounts
to
concrete
action
for
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
prosecution,
in
this
case,
overlooked
those
last
words,
“for
forcible
overthrow,”
and
went
on
the
assumption
that
if
you
could
show
incitement
to
action
of
any
kind
that
that
was
going
to
meet
the
standard
of
the
yates
case
with
the
result
which
i
will
now
come
to.
the
evidence
in
question
here,
your
honors,
consists
of
government
exhibits
64,
65,
and
66
and
they
appear
in
the
record
between
pages
a18
and
a22.
they
don't
appear.
they
are
quite
complete,
but
the
bulk
of
the
three
exhibits
are
there.
these
are
three
documents
which
strongly
attack
american
policy
in
korea
and
conduct
of
the
war
in
korea.
they
are
publications
a
pamphlet,
an
article,
and
a
book.
and
especially
government
exhibit
66
which
is
this
book,
extracts
and
which
appear
on
page
a21.
the
court
will
see
that
this
is
a
very
repellant
document.
i
will
forebear
to
read
what
is
there,
but
it
is
indeed
a
repellant
document.
but,
for
all
the
unattractive
features
of
these
documents,
there's
nothing
in
there
that
has
anything
to
do,
so
far
as
we
can
see
within
inciting
the
violent
overthrow
of
government.
nevertheless,
these
were
three
documents
out
of
a
group
of
about
half-a-dozen
that
the
government
offered
at
the
trial
for
the
specific
purpose
avowed
in
colloquy
at
the
bench,
which
appears
in
the
record
here,
that
these
were
being
offered
to
prove
incitement
to
action
in
order
to
meet
the
standards
described
in
the
yates
case.
there
was
objection
from
the
defense.there
was
extensive
colloquy.
there
was
more
argument
about
the
--
the
judge
reserved
his
ruling.
there
is
more
argument
about
it
after
the
government's
case
closed
when
we
had
our
motion
to
--
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
when
the
judge
denied
the
motion
for
acquittal,
he,
at
the
same
time,
ruled
on
this
group
of
documents.
he
allowed
these
three
to
be
received
and
excluded
about
three
others.
he
did
not
say
why
he
excluded
the
ones
he
excluded,
why
he
received
the
ones
that
he
received.
after
they
had
been
thus
received,
these
three
documents
that
aren't
guarded,
the
prosecution
then
read
extensively
from
these
documents
to
the
jury.
they
then
made
a
special
request
that
these
documents
be
sent
to
the
jury.
the
defense
moved
for
mistrial
on
the
ground
that
the
documents
were
both
remote
and
exceedingly
prejudicial
and
inflammatory.
that
was
denied.
the
prosecution
then,
after
the
evidence
was
closed,
in
its
summation
to
the
jury,
specifically
called
the
jury's
attention
to
this
exhibit
66
here
and
asked
the
jury
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
language
in
that
exhibit
that
would
incite
you
to
action.
in
other
words,
this
document
was
relied
on
expressly
before
the
jury
to
prove
incitement.
we
asked
for
charge
to
--
so
the
jury
would
not
feel
free
to
find
incitement
on
the
basis
of
this
document
--
this
sort
of
document
alone.
it
was
denied.
the
government
objected
and
it
was
denied.
now,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
raises
a
most
profound
constitutional
problem
that
if,
on
the
theory
of
the
court
below
and
the
government,
documents
which
are
nothing
more
than
polemical
attacks
on
government
policy
which
consist
of
publications,
books,
articles,
and
so
forth
which
are
means
of
expression
expressly
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
if
those
can
be
relied
on
as
evidence
of
incitement
to
violent
overthrow
and
if,
indeed,
the
jury
can
be
left
free
to
find
incitement
on
the
basis
of
that
alone,
that
this
indeed
has
ran
afoul
of
the
first
amendment.
we
think
that
the
theory
of
the
court
below
that
because
this
is
a
thing
which
blackens
the
government's
reputation
and
so
its
dissention,
that
that
means
that
it
is
weakening
the
government
against
the
potential
revolution,
that
this
theory
would
carry
it
so
far
that
there
will
be
very
little
indeed
left
for
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
telford
taylor
oh,
by
no
means,
your
honor.
there
is
other
evidence
on
this
that
the
government
relies
on
incitement.
we
do
not
believe
the
other
evidence
is
compelling
or
sufficient,
but
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
this
is
the
only
evidence
the
government
relies
on.
but,
the
judge
did
leave
it
open
to
the
jury
to
find
incitement
on
only
this
evidence
because
we
expressly
requested
that
they'd
be
charged,
that
this
alone
would
not
be
enough,
and
the
judge
refused
and
there
is
no
other
language
in
the
charge
that
would
fill
the
bill
there.
mr.
telford
taylor
he
charged
nothing
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
telford
taylor
he
rejected
it
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
wish
to
advert
to
specific
kinds
of
evidence.
he
may
have
thought
it
was
taken
cared
of
elsewhere,
but
i
do
not
think
so,
and
i
have
read
the
charge
carefully,
needless
to
say,
to
try
to
see
if
there
is
anything
there
that
could
be
relied
on
to
fill
the
same
function
and
i
am
unable
to
find
anything.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
your
honor.
i
would
not
so
characterize
it.
i
suppose
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
he
didn't
go
into
any
specific
evidence
and
he
wouldn't.
he
did
charge,
in
very
general
terms,
about
the
evidence.
we
do
believe
--
mr.
telford
taylor
the
charge
in
the
respect
i
am
adverting
to
now
is
seriously
deficient
and
we
made
other
objections
and
he
denied
other
requests
we
made,
but
this,
we
regard,
is
the
most
serious
and
crucial
lack
in
his
charge.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
was
left
to
the
jury
on
generalities
on
reasonable
doubt,
on
incitement,
on
advocacy,
that
there
was
language
taken
from
this
court's
opinions
that
were
relied
on
in
presenting
the
problems
to
them
but
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
evidence,
i
think,
in
the
terms
you
are
asking
about
now,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
telford
taylor
oh,
no.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
the
connection
with
the
defendant
was
simply
that
he
had
given
these
three
documents
to
one
of
the
informant-witnesses
who
had
joined
the
party.
so,
it
was
connected
with
him,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
read
it
or
that
he
invited
any
part
of
it
to
be
read.
he
may
or
he
may
not
have.
we
do
not
know.
he
gave
it
to
somebody.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
would
be
one
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
this
case,
that
there
was
abundant
reason
to
pick
this
evidence
because
he
had
already
had
to
caution
the
jury
on
its
inflammatory
character.
the
matter
had
been
much
mooted
before
him.
and
it
was
plain
that
there
was
grave
argument
about
whether
this
was
relevant
evidence
on
incitement
or
not.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
he
ruled
on
that
and
then
he
then
cautioned
the
jury.
but
it
was
also
plain
from
his
caution
to
the
jury
that
this
thing
had
an
impact,
and
the
prosecution
had
specifically
cited
it
to
the
jury
as
sufficient
proof
of
incitement.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
--
his
summation
to
the
jury.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
of
course,
justice
--
mr.
telford
taylor
we
did
not
ask
that
the
judge
single
out
this
document
and
say
--
mr.
telford
taylor
we
asked
--
mr.
telford
taylor
may
i
--
mr.
telford
taylor
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
charge
which
we
did
asked
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
a33,
proposed
instruction
number
7.
mr.
telford
taylor
a33,
it's
near
the
beginning.
mr.
telford
taylor
a33,
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
and,
you
will
see
that
what
we
asked
was
an
instruction
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
7,
well,
i
think
it
speaks
for
itself.
i
need
not
read
it.
it
was
an
instruction
which
was
phrased
in
general
terms
but
adverted
to
the
type
of
evidence
that
these
documents
consisted
of.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes?
mr.
telford
taylor
at
a40
--
which
page,
justice
brennan?
mr.
telford
taylor
a40.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
he
goes
on
to
the
abstract
doctrine
and
went
through
on
the
next
paragraph,
and
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
correct.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
if
there
is
any
other
place
later,
but
i
believe
not.
i
think
that
is
the
principal
place
that
he
dealt
with
incitement.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
statutory
question
before
my
time
runs
out.
this
arises
under
the
internal
security
act,
as
i
mentioned
before.
this
provision
passed
in
1950
which
appears
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix,
page
3a,
“neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
by
any
person
shall
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
(a)
or
(c)
of
this
section
or
of
any
other
criminal
statute.”
what
is
the
effect
of
that
provision
on
prosecutions
under
the
membership
clause?
now,
may
i
cite
first
that
we
know
why
it
is
in
this
statute.
the
internal
security
act
provides
for
an
elaborate
system
of
registration
of
members
of
the
communist
party.
would
there
not
be
a
danger
that
registration
as
a
communist
would
incriminate
one
and
could
they
not,
therefore,
decline
to
registration
pleading
the
fifth
amendment?
well
--
mr.
telford
taylor
1950,
10
years
later,
justice
stewart,
yes.
and,
this
danger
which
might
arise
to
the
functioning
of
the
statute
from
the
plea
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
pointed
out
to
congress
by
the
late
john
w.
davis
in
a
letter
and
it
was
his
letter
which
led
to
this
language
now
in
the
statute.
originally,
that
language
only
applied
to
sections
4
(a)
and
4
(c)
of
the
internal
security
act
itself,
but
then
it
was
amended
on
the
floor
by
adding
the
phrase
“any
other
criminal
statute,”
and
the
legislative
history
shows
pretty
clearly
that
that
was
done
with
the
membership
clause
in
mind.
so,
with
this
language
in
front
of
us
and
knowing
the
purpose,
how
do
we
interpret
it?
the
government
says
that
the
words
“per
se”
show
that
this
is
only
to
apply
to
membership
without
more,
that
it
does
not
apply
to
membership
plus
knowledge
and,
therefore,
is
not
a
part
of
this
sort
of
prosecution.
the
government
uses
the
phrase
“mere
membership,”
that
this
is
a
bar
to
the
prosecution
for
mere
membership
but
not
for
membership
with
knowledge.
we
do
not
think
this
view
will
stand
analysis.
we
think
it
does
bar
prosecutions
of
communists
under
the
membership
clause.
it
bars
prosecutions
unless
there
is
other
evidence
of
criminally
significant
acts
or
conducts,
such
as
under
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
smith
act
or
elsewhere
in
federal
statutes.
now,
what
is
the
matter
with
the
government's
position
here?
to
begin
with,
so
that
we
go
to
the
face
of
the
statute
before
legislative
history,
on
its
face
here,
section
4
(f)
doesn't
apply
merely
to
membership
and
there
are
the
words
“or
the
holding
of
office,”
so
that
it
goes
outside
of
membership
right
on
its
face.
and,
the
significance
of
that
is
rather
greater
than
the
mere
presence
of
those
words,
“office
holding.”
in
the
government's
brief,
for
example,
when
they
come
to
the
matter
of
how
evidence
is
to
be
weighed,
we
find
that
the
government,
and
i'm
looking
at
the
government's
brief,
page
85,
scales
was
an
officer
of
the
communist
party.
he
had
been
chairman
of
the
district
of
north
carolina
and
we
find,
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
85,
acknowledging
his
role
as
a
party
functionary,
that
is
an
officer,
petitioner
contends
that
the
evidence
is
not
enough
to
show
his
knowledge
of
the
party's
character,
and
so
forth.
then,
it
goes
on.
of
course,
petitioner's
status
as
a
leader
of
such
a
rigidly
disciplined
and
indoctrinated
organization
is,
in
itself,
strong
evidence
against
the
suggestion
that
he
might
have
not
known
what
the
party
was
about
or
might
not
have
purposed
the
furtherance
of
its
ends.
now,
i
don't
know
much
latin
but
“in
itself”
i
think
means,
in
simple
english,
the
very
same
thing
as
those
latin
words
“per
se”
in
section
4
(f).
and,
if
we
are
confronted
with
a
situation
where
being
an
officer
is,
in
itself,
strong
evidence
of
knowledge
and
intent
and
if
being
an
officer
is
not
guilt
and
cannot
be
under
section
4
(f),
it
seems
to
me,
plain
enough,
that
section
4
(f)
does
comprehend
something
more
than
what
the
government
calls
mere
membership.
office
holding
does
carry
with
it,
according
to
the
government
itself,
evidentiary
implication
in
terms
of
knowledge
and
intent.
so,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
that
view,
we
think,
will
not
stand
up.
the
government's
position,
we
think,
is
also
squarely
in
the
face
of
basic
questions
and
basic
principles
of
statutory
construction.
a
base
--
such
a
basic
principle
is
to
give
effect
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
so
they're
not
nugatory
and
redundant.
section
4
(f)
applies
specifically
to
subsections
4
(a)
and
(c),
and
via
the
phrase
“any
other
criminal
statute”
to
the
membership
clause.
all
three
of
those
statutes,
section
(a),
section
(c),
and
the
membership
clause,
all
specifically
require
knowledge
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
so
that,
if
we
say
4
(f)
applies
only
where
there
is
knowledge,
there
is
absolutely
no
statute,
no
part
of
the
internal
security
act
which
can
apply,
no
other
statute
which
can
apply,
and
it
is
left
with
absolutely
nothing
to
apply
to.
finally,
though,
i
think
we
do
have
to
look
to
some
extent
of
the
congressional
purpose
here
and,
if
we
do,
it
becomes
even
plainer.
what
congress
wanted
to
do
is
to
create
an
effective
system
of
registration
of
communist
party
members.
to
do
that,
it
had
to,
so
far
as
possible,
remove
the
bar
of
the
fifth
amendment
so
that
people
could
decline
to
register
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination.
whether
it
was
successful
doing
that
is
not
at
issue
here
but,
certainly,
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
now,
the
effect
--
the
practical
effect
of
the
government's
construction
here
is
that
only
those
communists
who
do
not
know
the
teachings
of
the
party
could
be
required
to
register.
all
the
others
would
remain
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
membership
clause
for
membership
plus
knowledge,
could
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
and
defeat
registration
that
way.
so
that,
it
seems
to
us
that,
in
terms
of
congressional
purpose,
this
would
simply
reduce
the
act
to
a
futility.
the
government
says
again
and
again,
in
its
brief,
that
it
seems
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
exempted
communists
from
the
membership
clause
in
1950.
we
think
that
overlooks
that
there
are
a
variety
of
legislative
techniques
for
dealing
with
communism
and
its
relation
to
internal
security.
in
1950,
congress,
we
think,
made
a
judgment
that
it
was
more
important
for
this
registration
system
to
function
than
to
--
than
to
prosecute
members
under
the
membership
clause.
it's
a
very
easy
one
to
make.
there
had
been
substantially
no
prosecutions
under
the
membership
clause.
the
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act
remained
available
anyhow
and,
so,
it
would
have
been
entirely
compatible
with
congressional
intent
to
say
it's
much
more
important
that
we
make
this
machine
work
than
to
keep
on
the
books
a
clause
which
hadn't
been
put
to
any
practical
use
up
to
that
point.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
telford
taylor
by
not
availing
themselves
of
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i'm
afraid
i
have
not
followed.
they
have
availed
themselves
the
membership
clause
by
the
fact
to
prosecution.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
certainly
not.
mr.
telford
taylor
certainly
not.
the
--
there
are
other
points
in
the
case.
i'm
afraid
the
time
--
pressure
of
time
will
permit
me
to
touch
on
only
two
of
them
very
briefly.
there
is,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
a
problem
of
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
under
the
yates
case
here.
the
evidence
is
extensively
analyzed
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
record.
our
record
a25
to
32
is
a
replica
of
our
memorandum
comparing
the
evidence
here
with
the
--
with
the
evidence
in
the
yates
case.we
think
that
the
court
will
be
unable
to
find
any
evidence
of
a
different
kind
or
evidence
which
meets
the
deficiency
that
the
court
noted
in
the
yates
case.
the
government
says,
in
their
brief,
that
there
were
new
witnesses
this
time.
that
is
true.
there
were
witnesses
in
the
second
trial
here
that
were
not
in
the
first
trial
but,
surely,
that
is
irrelevant.
it's
not
whether
they
are
new
or
old.
it's
what
they
say.
and
the
witnesses
that
were
new
in
the
second
trial
here
were
all
old
witnesses
in
the
sense
of
having
testified
in
plenty
of
other
smith
act
cases
anyhow.
it
stands
to
reason,
i
think,
that
when
the
government
has
tried
17
or
18
smith
act
cases
over
the
course
of
five
or
six
years,
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove
different
things
about
the
communist
party
the
19th
time
when
you
prove
maybe
the
eighth
attempt.
in
the
nature
of
things,
the
--
the
evidence
about
the
party
could
not
be
very
much
altered
and,
indeed,
it
wasn't.
the
main
thing
the
government
has
relied
on
here
is
more
extensive
evidence
of
teachings
at
these
party
schools
and
statements
attributed
to
communist
instructors
and
lecturers.
it
may
be
there
is
a
little
more
such
evidence
here
than
in
the
yates
case
but
it's
the
same
kind
of
thing.
it
all
took
place
at
places
far
along
with
the
petitioner,
so
there's
a
problem
of
connection
with
the
--
with
the
defendant
here,
too,
that
i
really
don't
have
time
to
develop
fully
but
is
developed
in
the
brief.
there
is
a
very
difficult
problem
here
in
the
way
the
evidence
was
handled
and,
in
the
erroneous
admission,
both
in
terms
of
the
order
of
evidence
and
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
court
allowed
in.
there
was
what
i
can
only
describe
as
an
unchecked
avalanche
of
testimony
for
a
whole
week
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
trial
took
approximately
two-and-a
half
weeks,
and
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
the
defendant's
name
was
not
mentioned
for
about
the
first
six
days.
now,
we
may
assume
that
some
evidence
is
admissible
on
the
party
that
doesn't
touch
the
defendant.
nonetheless,
when
you
have
a
week
of
testimony,
and
some
of
this
is
admitted
subject
to
connection,
the
jury
cannot
possibly
keep
such
an
amount
and
such
a
variety
of
evidence
straight
as
to
whether
it
later
is
or
is
not
connected
up.
we
objected
at
the
outset
to
this
order
of
proof
and
this
volume
of
proof
unsuccessfully.
there
is
evidence
so
remote
as
to
be
totally
indefensible
here.
there's
some
evidence
going
back
to
communist
meetings
held
in
1930
in
seattle,
in
cleveland,
and
new
york
when
the
defendant
was
a
pre-high
school
child.
how
he
can
be
bound
by
testimony
of
that
sort?
i
do
not
know.
there
was
a
lot
of
testimony
about
controversial
subjects
like
the
stockholm
peace
appeal,
and
whether
the
rosenberg
should
have
clemency.
and,
one
thing
and
another,
the
government
seemed
to
think
had
something
to
do
with
incitement
of
force
and
violence
but
which,
for
the
life
of
me,
i
cannot
see
bears
on
this
at
all.
that
kind
of
evidence,
of
course,
may
be
effective
with
juries
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
but
all
this
built
up
into
a
mountain
of
--
of
prejudicial
irrelevancy
from
start
to
finish,
a
--
a
tangle
that
the
jury
could
not
possibly
unravel
after
three
weeks
of
this.unaided
by
the
instruction,
which
justice
frankfurter
thought,
in
a
way
of
charge,
might
have
been
helpful
here
especially.
mr.
telford
taylor
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
i'm
right
in
saying
about
2500
is
right
there.
i
would
check
and
tell
your
honor
after
recess.
mr.
telford
taylor
this
record
represents
the
agreed,
between
the
government
and
defense,
selections
from
that
which
have
been
printed.
this
--
the
first
part
of
it
was
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
second
part
is
substantially
the
government's
brief
in
the
court
--
record
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
appendix
to
their
brief
plus
a
little
addition.
and
that
--
that
is
the
transcript
on
the
table
there,
justice
harlan.
mr.
telford
taylor
we
will
be
glad
to
leave
this
one
here.
the
court
has
one.
mr.
telford
taylor
we
have
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
some
more
here.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
sir,
there's
one
in
the
clerk's
office.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
record
is
2225
pages
long.
we
find
we
are,
if
anything,
better
equipped
with
records
than
the
government,
so
were
going
to
leave
one
of
our
sets
with
the
clerk
so
there
will
be
an
extra.
mr.
telford
taylor
as
for
your
request.
my
very
able
adversary
started
out
by
saying
that
guilt
by
association
is
the
core
of
our
case
on
constitutionality.
i
do
not
recall
using
the
expression
on
argument,
and
i
do
not
regard
it
as
the
core
of
our
case
on
constitutionality.
there
are
people
who
do.
the
distinguished
lawyer
john
lord
o'brien
is
--
has
written
to
that
effect
but
this
matter
of
guilt
by
association
seems
to
me
to
go
more
to
the
--
to
a
sort
of
due
process
question
of
what
sort
of
evidence
can
connect
you
with
a
criminal
group
rather
than
to
the
first
amendment.
the
--
if
there
is
any
single
core
to
our
case
on
constitutionality,
i
would
suppose
it
is
more
to
be
found
in
justice
brandeis'
concurring
opinion
in
the
whitney
case
where
he
points
out
that
a
statute
such
as
this,
covering
membership,
establishes
guilt
because
the
accused
is
to
be
punished
not
for
contempt,
incitement,
or
conspiracy
but
for
a
step
in
preparation
which,
if
it
threatens
the
public
order
at
all,
does
so
only
remotely.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
i
would
say
so.
he's
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
that
is
the
idea.
he
goes
on
to
speak
of
the
novelty
of
the
statute
and
that
it
punishes
not
even
the
even
the
preaching
of
it
but
association
with
those
who
propose
to
preach
it.
so,
he
is
clearly
relating
it
to
what
i
would
regard
as
assembly
--
freedom
of
assembly
in
the
first
amendment.
now,
our
construction
of
the
membership
clause
here
does
not,
i
think,
rest
on
so
bare
a
construction
of
the
wording,
as
mr.
davis
suggests.
we
do
agree
that
there
is
room
for
the
interpretation
of
statutes,
even
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
make
them
constitutional,
but
we
think
that
the
government
has
gone
much
too
far
here
as
is
shown
by
that
comparative
point
in
our
reply
brief,
especially
when
they
try
to
bring
this
all
the
way
to
conspiracy
by
saying
this
covers
deeply
conspirational
groups.
when
you've
gone
that
far,
you
have
gone
much
too
far
beyond
the
permissible
bounds
and
you
have
twisted
the
“nose
of
wax,”
to
use
chief
justice
taft's
phrase.
and,
you
have
also,
really,
read
the
membership
clause
out
of
the
statute
because
you
made
it
the
same
as
the
preceding
conspiracy
portions,
and
mr.
davis
didn't
really
advert
to
that
feature.
he
does
speak
a
good
deal
about
this
problem
of
activity.
now,
we
really
don't
believe
that
even
if
you
would
read
“active”
into
the
statute
that
that
is
going
to
be
very
much
help
on
constitutionality.
in
the
yates
case,
there
was
a
very
careful
survey
of
the
evidence
pertaining
to
individual
defendants.
if
activity,
by
itself,
were
to
be
an
index
of
constitutionality
here,
i
would
have
assumed
that
all
those
defendants
in
the
yates
case
were
rightfully
convicted
and
that
the
court
would
have
been
wrong
in
reversing
as
to
five
of
them
because
those
five
who,
and
which
the
court
even
barred
a
new
trial,
included
people
who
are
very,
very
active,
people
who
were
journalists
in
charge
of
communist
press,
who
were
turning
out
some
material
that
they
certainly
hoped
would
sell
dissention
and
blacken
the
reputation
of
the
government.
but,
the
court
said
that
those
were
simply
lawful
activities.
the
mere
fact
that
a
person
is
active
without
more
doesn't
seem
to
get
us
anywhere,
it
seem
to
me
to
get
us
anywhere
in
terms
of
constitutionality.
now,
it
is
perfectly
true,
as
mr.
davis
says,
that
the
prosecution
submitted
the
issue
of
activity
to
the
jury
here
--
i
mean,
the
judge
did,
on
the
prosecution's
request,
but
i
look
at
mr.
davis'
brief
on
page
67
and
i
see
in
his
brief
that
he
says
that
it
shouldn't
have
gone
to
the
jury
at
all.
that
it
ought
to
have
been
decided
by
the
judge.
so,
i'm
still
a
little
at
a
lost
as
to
what
would
have
been
the
proper
procedure
here
under
his
theory.
in
connection
with
this
matter
of
construing
the
membership
clause,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
that
the
clause
contains
a
prohibition
against
being
an
affiliate
of
the
communist
party.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
government
has
never
sought
to
bring
a
case
under
that
clause.
perhaps
there
are
constitutional
worries
about
it
in
addition
to
those
in
the
rest
of
the
clause,
but
the
presence
of
that,
seems
to
me
quite
clearly,
indicate
that
congress
did
not
have
this
very
restricted
quasi-military
conspirational
theory
of
membership
that
the
government
here
is
contending
for
because,
certainly,
affiliation
means
some
kind
of
a
looser,
looser
and
lesser
connection
with
the
organization
than
membership.
and,
i
note,
finally,
on
this
portion
of
the
argument
that
the
government
itself
when
it
is
not
considering
constitutionality
but
is
dealing
with
what
evidence
is
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
here,
it
construes
this
clause
in
quite
a
different,
and,
it
seems
to
me,
a
much
more
satis
--
much
more
reasonable
way
because
when
they're
dealing
with
the
evidence,
they
say
at
page
77
of
their
brief,
that,
in
a
membership
case,
it
suffices
to
prove
that
the
party
as
such,
and
not
necessarily
including
the
defendant,
engaged
in
the
forbidden
advocacy
and
that
the
defendant
was
a
member
of
the
party
with
the
necessary
knowledge
and
intent.
mr.
telford
taylor
77,
footnote
33,
toward
the
end.
so
that,
when
their
--
when
the
government's
mind
is
not
on
constitutionality,
they
put
this
clause
in
the
very
bear
terms
that
we
think
the
statute
speaks.
now,
could
i
just
make
a
comment
about
the
question
justice
black
asked
about
that
prohibition
statute.
our
situation
here
is
i
think
a
harder
case
to
sustain
the
statute
than
to
sustain
the
application
of
the
statute
here
than
the
one
that
justice
black
gave.
we
don't
have
a
case
here
where
there
is
no
organization
which,
in
its
platform,
puts
in
what
you
might
call
an
illegal
plank.
there's
a
plank
advocating
illegality.
if
you
look
at
the
platform
of
the
communist
party,
you
will
find
not
only
that
they
eschew
force
and
violence,
but
provisions
in
there
for
the
expulsion
of
anybody
who
advocates
it.
now,
the
government's
theory
and
evidence
they
have
brought
in
support
of
their
theory
is,
of
course,
that
those
words
in
the
platform
are
spurious,
aesopian,
the
words
that's
been
used,
and
that
there
is
a
secret
agreement
among
the
leaders
of
the
party
to
preach
unlawful
incitement
to
advocate
unlawful
action.
so
that,
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
case
of
an
openly
proclaimed
illegal
aim,
but
a
secretly
advocated
illegal
aim,
if
anything.
and,
that
is
why
this
question
of
connection
with
the
defendant
is
so
important.
if
illegal
advocacy
were
in
the
platform
of
the
party,
you
could
quite
reasonably
hold
the
members
to
some
knowledge
of
it
because
this
would
be
a
publicly
proclaimed
aim
but,
as
soon
as
you
depart
from
that
and
are
talking
about
some
kind
of
a
private
and
secret
agreement
among
the
leaders
not
reflected
in
the
public
announcements
then,
certainly,
the
defendant
who
is
tried
for
membership
should
not
be
bound
by
this
--
the
secret
advocacies
unless
it
is
shown
that
he
had
knowledge
of
it.
and,
that
brings
us
to
some
of
the
remarks
that
my
adversary
made
about
schools
here.
justice
harlan
asked
the
date
of
this
new
evidence
that's
come
into
the
case
since
yates.
it
is
quite
true
that
there
is
evidence
about
this
school
in
north
carolina
in
1952,
which
the
defendant
attended,
but
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
that
the
evidence
about
unlawful
advocacy,
on
which
the
government
chiefly
relies,
was
at
other
schools.
and,
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
in
the
testimony
about
this
school
in
north
carolina
any
of
this
violent
advocacy
that
he
quoted
some
from
in
connection
with
these
other
schools.
on
the
matter
of
witnesses,
justice
harlan,
i
do
have
here
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
the
yates
case
and
it
is
a
fact
that
lochner
was
a
common
witness
in
yates
and
here.
i
believe
it
also
to
be
a
fact
that
there
were
no
other
common
witnesses
between
yates
and
scales,
but
the
other
witnesses
in
scales
were
common
witnesses
with
many
other
smith
act
cases
which
were
disposed
of
in
the
lower
courts,
following
this
court's
decision
in
yates.
they
were
not
new
witnesses
in
the
sense
of
being
their
testimony
about
the
party
being
new
and
different
from
what
have
been
testified
about
in
other
cases.
i
gather
that
the
government
chiefly
relies
on
the
circumstance
that
there
was
more
voluminous
testimony
about
what
was
said
of
these
schools
and
perhaps
more
violent
language.
now,
i
think
the
story
here
is
really
quite
clear.
it's
all
in
the
yates
case.
it
is
quite
clear
on
the
yates
record
that,
after
this
reconstitution
of
the
party
in
1945
when
there
was
this
return
to
the
doctrines
of
marxism
and
leninism,
there
was
a
great
campaign
through
these
communist
schools
to
what
they
called
reeducation
to
bring
the
party
members
back
to
the
doctrines
of
marxism
and
leninism.
and,
most
of
these
statements
were
made
in
the
course
of
that
so-called
reeducation
program.
now,
in
the
record
of
this
case,
and
i'm
sorry
about
these
as
and
other
things
that
are
confusing
about
the
record,
the
reason
for
it
is,
in
order
to
--
mr.
telford
taylor
thank
you.
you
will
find
in
the
a
part
of
it,
the
beginning
part
of
it,
that
we
made
an
analysis
of
the
evidence
here
as
compared
to
the
evidence
in
yates,
between
pages
a25
and
a32.
almost
everything
that
mr.
davis
spoke
about
and
almost
everything
that
his
brief
speaks
about,
you
will
find
referred
to
with
chapter
and
verse
to
the
yates
record
as
being
a
duplicate.
this
campaign
of
reeducation
of
communist
party
members
in
this
extensive
lecturing
in
schools
about
the
inevitability
of
force
and
violence
is
all
in
the
yates
case.
for
instance,
at
the
top
of
page
a29,
you
will
find
the
references
where
that
would
be
found
in
yates.
there
is,
i
assure
the
court,
nothing
new
in
quality
about
this
record
and
i
think,
in
the
nature
of
things,
there
couldn't
have
been.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
that
is
the
testimony
only,
justice
black.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
exhibit
i
was
talking
about
was
governments
exhibit
66,
and
i'll
recall
it
later
on.
i
think
there's
about
130
government
exhibits.
mr.
telford
taylor
some
of
them
are
very
long,
i'm
afraid.
some
of
them
are
books
by
lennon
and
trotsky,
and
even
older
ones
than
that.
mr.
telford
taylor
books.
others
--
mr.
telford
taylor
they
certainly
didn't
have
time.
they
had
opportunity.
they
were
taken
to
the
jury
room
along
with
these
documents
about
the
korean
war.
i
just
wanted
to
close
with
one
reference
to
those
documents
about
the
korean
war,
which
mr.
davis
said
i
thought
advoc
--
incited
so
strongly
that
i
didn't
want
to
read
them
to
the
court.
of
course,
my
point
was
they
don't
incite
to
violence
at
all.
that
isn't
what
they
do.
they
might
incite
to
violence
against
the
man
who
wrote
the
book.
this
is
conceivable.
the
--
there's
a
repellant
document
but,
in
the
terms
of
inciting
anybody
else
to
take
any
illegal
action
toward
the
government,
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
bears
on
that.
it
is
simply
a
repellant
attack
on
government
conduct
to
the
war
and,
it
seems
to
me,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
in
the
yates
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes?
mr.
telford
taylor
i
am.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
mean,
i
am
following
you.
i
am
not
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
am
following
you.
i
haven't
agreed.
mr.
telford
taylor
now
--
mr.
telford
taylor
may
i
call
the
court
--
mr.
telford
taylor
may
i
now
comment?
i
do
not
believe,
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
opinion
in
the
whitney
case
--
this
peculiar
opinion
involved
any
assumption
that
the
organization
there
was
advocating
the
revolution
far
in
the
future.
what
the
justice
--
mr.
telford
taylor
excuse
me.
mr.
telford
taylor
well
--
mr.
telford
taylor
necessarily.
mr.
telford
taylor
necessarily
far
in
the
future
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
all
he
is
saying
there
is
that
the
circumstances
at
the
time,
being
what
they
are,
the
likelihood
of
any
revolution
other
than
one
far
in
the
future
is
very
small,
but
he
is
--
mr.
telford
taylor
he
--
mr.
telford
taylor
he
--
excuse
me.
i
think
he
was
saying
that
the
revolution,
if
it
came
at
all,
would
be
far
in
the
future
but
he
wasn't
saying
that
the
party
only
advocated
it
far
in
the
future.
the
party
which
is
there,
two
different
organizations
actually,
iww
and
another,
didn't
say
“we
are
only
going
to
advocate
this
far
in
future.”
their
advocacy
was
just
as
present
as
here,
and
all
that
justice
brandeis
is
saying
is
that,
“really,
i
don't
believe
it's
likely
to
come
until
quite
a
long
time
from
now.”
mr.
telford
taylor
so,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
telford
taylor
the
dennis
case,
like
this
one,
involved
a
present
advocacy
under
circumstances
where
the
action
might
not
come
until
the
future,
but
i
think
the
justice's
--
justice
brandeis'
opinion
here
is
quite
clear
that
he
was
much
concerned
with
the
degree
of
association
with
the
organization.
the
part
you
read
is
a
part
of
the
opinion
eight
pages
after
the
part
that
i
have
been
reading
for.
and
i
think,
in
the
earlier
part,
he
makes
it
quite
clear
that
he
is
troubled
about
the
remoteness
of
an
--
a
membership
association
with
a
criminal
element
here.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
other
one.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
other
one.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
why
it
was
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
what
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i'm
sorry
to
trespass
so
far
on
the
red
light,
but
i
think
there
are
several
things
in
this
opinion
which
is
eight
or
nine
pages
long
and
his
concurrence
was
based
on
testimony
linking
her
with
a
quite
different
organization
than
the
one
he
was
talking
about
in
the
first
part
of
the
opinion.
and,
therefore,
the
earlier
part
of
the
opinion
dealing
with
this
other
organization,
what
he
is
talking
about
is
the
degree
of
association
with
it.
now,
since
the
statute
punishes
not
only
membership
but
organizing
and
since
there
were
still
other
evidence
of
present
crimes,
as
he
mentioned,
that
is
why
he
concurred.
and,
he
said
it
at
the
same
time
that
if
the
clear
and
present
danger
problem
had
been
raised
below,
why,
then,
we
would
have
been
confronted
with
all
these
constitutional
problems,
right
of
assembly,
which
she
is
talking
about
at
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
--
that
appeals
to
me,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
are
the
two
questions,
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
telford
taylor
this
case
coming
up
from
the
fourth
circuit
is
here
on
reargument
under
the
court's
order
of
june
29th,
1959.
in
that
order,
counsel
were
asked
to
address
themselves
to
a
series
of
questions
specified
therein,
and
then
both
parties
have
now
done
this
by
filing
supplemental
briefs.
i
should
add
that
in
both
cases,
both
the
government's
brief
and
the
petitioner's
brief
are
directed
and
pointed
specifically
to
those
questions
put
by
the
court
and
they
are,
therefore,
not
intended
to
replace
the
briefs
that
were
filed
prior
to
the
initial
argument
of
1958
term.
the
government,
however,
has
reprinted
its
original
brief
and
bound
it
with
the
supplemental,
petitioner,
being
less
affluent,
has
been
unable
to
do
that
and,
therefore,
the
courts
still
has
our
brief
and
reply
brief
from
the
1958
term
and
our
supplemental
brief
from
the
1959
term
and
reply
brief
filed
last
week.
now
your
honors,
the
questions
that
are
stated
in
that
order
of
june
29th
all
go
to
the
validity
of
the
indictment,
both
in
the
constitutional
and
statutory
sense.
the
court
will
recall
that
when
this
case
was
on
argument
in
the
1958
term
that
there
was
considerable
discussion
of
other
issues,
specifically,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
the
court's
order
of
june
29th,
as
we
read
it,
does
not
exclude
those
--
all
the
matters
from
the
further
discussion.
i
doubt
the
time
will
permit
me
this
morning
to
go
back
to
those
but
we
would
like
to
reiterate
our
belief
that
they
are
very
substantial.
we
have
dealt
with
one
or
two
of
them
in
the
supplemental
brief.
and
if
time
permits,
i
will
say
a
few
more
words
on
that
score.
however,
we
do
believe
that
the
validity
of
the
indictment
itself
should
now
be
passed
upon,
and
accordingly,
i
will
proceed
directly
to
the
questions
that
are
posed
in
the
court's
order
for
reargument.
that
order
incidentally,
if
the
court
has
occasion
to
refer
to
it,
is
set
out
in
appendix
a
of
our
supplemental
brief
on
reargument.
the
first
four
questions
relate
to
constitutionality
and
the
fifth
to
the
statutory
sufficiency
of
the
indictments.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
last
question
first.
i
do
that
because
it
is
quite
separate
because
it
can
be
dealt
with
more
briefly
and
because,
if
our
view
is
correct,
there
is
a
statutory
bar
to
this
prosecution
and
that
would
be
finally
dispositive
to
the
case
without
touching
the
constitutional
issues.
and
this
statutory
question
can
be
stated
very
simply,
and
that
is,
whether
the
statutory
bar
is
coextensive
with
the
statutory
crime
known
as
the
membership
clause.
might
i
also
interpolate
at
this
point
that
the
relevant
statutes
were
set
forth
in
our
brief
filed
in
the
1958
term.
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
we've
also
put
the
--
the
most
closely
involved
statutes,
the
smith
act
and
the
pertinent
sections
of
the
internal
security
act
in
the
back
of
our
brief
on
reargument.
the
court
will
recall
from
the
prior
arguments
that
the
crime
charged
here
under
the
membership
clause
is
becoming
a
member
or
an
affiliate
of
a
group
or
society
of
persons
that
advocate
force
to
overthrow
its
governments.
and
the
statutory
bar
that
raises
the
question
under
the
internal
security
act,
section
4
(f),
provides
that
neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
by
any
person
shall
constitute
a
violation
--
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
either
subsections
(a)
or
(c)
of
that
section
itself
of
the
internal
security
act,
or
of
any
other
criminal
statutes.
therefore,
by
its
terms,
it
applies
to
all
of
the
criminal
statutes
including
the
smith
act.
the
question
is
whether
that
bar
is
coextensive
with
the
membership
clause
that
i
have
read
to
before.
government
says
it
is
not.
government
says
it
is
not
and
that
section
4
(f),
with
that
bar
in
it,
should
be
read
as
if
it
said
neither
the
holding
of
office
nor
membership
in
any
communist
organization
without
knowledge
of
its
advocacy
of
violent
overthrow
shall
constitute
a
violation
of
this
or
any
other
criminal
statutes.
of
course,
4
(f)
doesn't
say
that
and
the
government's
construction
must
therefore
be
derived
by
inference
from
the
words
"per
se"
constitute
per
se
a
violation.
now,
the
court
often
and
properly
reminds
counsel
before
it
that
when
one
approaches
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
the
first
place
to
look
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
before
entering
into
the
realms
of
legislative
history.
and
if
we
do
that,
one
must
first
take
note
of
the
fact
that
the
government's
principle
argument
here
throughout
has
been
that
section
4
(f),
with
that
statutory
bar,
relates
only
to
what
has
been
variously
described
as
mere
membership,
naked
membership,
membership
without
more.
those
descriptive
phrases
occur
throughout
the
government's
briefs.
but
if
we
look
at
the
language
of
4
(f)
itself,
we
see
that
that
construction
is
impossible
under
the
--
on
the
face
of
the
statute
because
the
face
of
the
statute
extends
that
bar
not
only
to
membership
but
to
the
holding
of
office.
and
that
is
certainly
something
more
than
mere
or
naked
membership,
whatever
one
is
to
infer
from
those
expressions.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
suppose
even
that
must
be
more
than
--
more
than
naked
membership,
justice
harlan.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
are
two
different
concepts
and
obviously,
the
officership
connotes
things
that
membership
alone
does
not,
it
seems
to
me.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
with
the
word
--
the
hold
it
words,
the
holding
of
office
in
there,
one
must
conclude
that
the
bar
extends
to
membership
accompanied
by
the
normal
attributes
of
office
holding
whatever
those
maybe.
and
i
certainly
think
also
that
that
suggests
some
familiarity
with
the
purposes
of
the
organization
which
offices
held.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
usual
--
the
customary
attributes
of
office
holding.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
didn't
say
necessarily,
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
that
could
always
be
rebutted.
mr.
telford
taylor
membership
also
implies
from
attribute,
yes.
but
i
should
suppose
it
implies
less
attributes
than
office
holding
because
office
holding
implies
certain
things
about
activity,
familiarity
etcetera,
etcetera.
and
--
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
justice
clark,
no
doubt
at
all.
the
registration
is
to
be
made
in
the
first
instance
by
the
officers
of
the
organization
and
if
they
do
not
do
it
or
do
it
incompletely,
then
members
are
bound
to
come
in
and
give
their
own
names.
but
this
seems
to
me
to
detract
nothing
from
the
normal
implications
of
the
holding
of
office.
mr.
telford
taylor
they'd
have
to
do
it
through
the
officers
i
suppose.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
--
i
think,
justice
clark,
the
--
the
organization
has
to
do
it
and
it
would
do
it
through
its
officers.
there's
no
way
they
can't.
mr.
telford
taylor
and
if
they
don't
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
but
i
suppose
it
must
be
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
must
be
done
in
the
name
of
somebody.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
must
be
done
on
the
name
of
somebody
the
counsel
will
be
representing
someone.
mr.
telford
taylor
and
if
the
officers
failed
to
file,
then
members,
in
turn,
have
an
obligation
to
file
their
names
so
there
is
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
is
certainly
clear
the
congress
envisage
that
officers
would
likely
be
filing
and
they
wish
to
extend
this
bar
not
only
to
the
attributes
of
membership
but
the
attributes
of
office
holding.
the
purpose
of
the
section
is
something
that
i
plan
to
come
to
in
a
minute
when
we
come
to
legislative
history.
but
dealing
with
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
which
is
we've
been
repeatedly
obliged,
is
the
first
place
to
turn.
the
normal
implications
of
a
holding
of
office
seem
to
me
to
include
the
measure
of
activity
and
the
measure
of
knowledge
about
the
organization.
and
indeed,
the
government
has
consented
that
vigorously
in
this
very
case.
they
suggested
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
held
office
in
the
party
is
itself
a
strong
evidence
of
his
knowledge
of
the
party's
unlawful
aims.
and
within
the
statute
itself,
there
is
further
implication,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
the
rest
of
the
statute
is
set
out
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
in
number
12,
which
is
to
be
heard
later
this
week.
and
section
2
of
the
internal
security
act
contains
various
recitals
and
findings
by
congress
about
the
communist
party
indicating
clearly
enough
that
the
congress
believed
the
communist
party
to
be
an
organization
that
advocates
violent
overthrow.
it
says
so
in
so
many
words
in
paragraphs
8
and
13
of
section
2.
and
then
again,
and
it
says
in
that
same
section,
the
communist
party
members
are
rigidly
disciplined
and
carefully
indoctrinated.
it
seems
to
me
incredible
that
congress
after
writing
that
into
section
2
and
writing
communist
officers
under
section
4
would
have
intended
to
mean
only
communist
officers
who
do
not
know
what
they
have
been
presumably
indoctrinated
to
know.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
an
evidentiary
question
as
to
whether
office
holding
establishes
knowledge
or
anything
else.
we
are
dealing
with
the
indicia
of
congressional
intent.
and
if
congress
speaking
in
section
2
in
this
thing
about
the
party,
about
membership
they
are
in,
it
would
seem
to
be
a
--
an
almost
unavoidable
inference,
that
when
they
said
the
office
holding,
they
weren't
thinking
about
what
justice
harlan
described
as
naked
office
holding
but
office
holding
with
the
normal
things
one
would
associate
with
office
holding.
and
i
don't
think
one
normally
assumes
that
an
officeholder
is
--
is
ignorant,
inactive,
or
naked.
this
--
these
are
the
normal
attributes
of
office
holding
and
if
one
is
looking
for
congressional
intent,
this,
i
think,
is
what
one
would
see
in
that
phrase.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
meaning
that
we
give
to
phrase
"per
se",
justice
stewart,
is
that
this
means
that
under
the
internal
security
act
or
the
smith
act
or
any
other
act,
because
the
bar
is
general
in
the
other
criminal
statute,
the
defendant
must
be
charged
with
some
conduct
other
than
being
an
officer
or
member
of
the
communist
party.
under
the
smith
act,
he
would
have
to
be
charged
with
advocacy
or
distribution
or
organizing
or
conspiracy
to
do
those
things
under
the
internal
security
act
in
paragraphs
4
(a)
and
4
(c)
which
are
the
two
other
criminal
provisions
specifically
referred
to
in
a
statutory
bar.
under
(c),
he
would
have
had
to
receive
or
attempt
to
receive
some
document
from
some
--
some
classified
documents.
under
4
(a),
he
would
have
had
to
commit
some
act
other
than,
if
it
is
an
act,
being
a
member
or
an
officer
which
would
tend
to
the
establishment
of
a
totalitarian
dictatorship
under
foreign
control.
this
means
that
under
any
of
those
provisions
or
any
other
criminal
statutes,
there
must
be
some
conduct
other
than
being
an
officer
or
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
indeed,
all
those
other
provisions
do
describe
other
kinds
--
describe
activities
such
as
advocacy
or
getting
documents
which
congress
has
prescribed
as
criminal.
that
is
the
meaning
we
give
to
per
se.
you
could
not,
for
example,
indict
someone
under
4
(a)
and
say
that
he
had
committed
an
act
favoring
the
establishment
of
a
totalitarian
dictatorship
in
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
communist
party.
we
have
to
say
something
more.
we
have
to
charge
him
with
some
other
conduct
beyond
that.
"per
se"
means
that
the
proof
of
office
holding
a
membership
is
not
a
sufficient
proof
of
conduct,
something
else
must
have
been
done.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
not,
justice
stewart,
i
think
we're
telling
you
that
it's
--
that
it's
not
redundant.
under
the
--
under
the
government's
interpretation
here,
if
this
bar
is
only
a
membership
with
knowledge
--
with
--
without
knowledge,
it
is
completely
redundant
because
it
bars
nothing
at
all.
the
membership
clause
itself
specifically
requires
knowledge.
4
(a)
and
4
(c)
specifically
require
knowledge.
it's
a
different
kind
of
knowledge;
it's
a
different
kind
of
crime
that's
defined
therein.
but
all
those
provisions
require
knowledge.
and
therefore,
if
you
interpret
the
bar
to
apply
only
to
membership
without
knowledge,
it
is
no
bar
at
all.
it
would
bar
nothing
that
it
could
--
could
have
been
prosecuted
in
the
absence
of
4
(f).
this
indeed
seems
to
us
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
against
the
government's
construction.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
would
have
to
say,
justice
frankfurter,
super
hyper
abundance
of
caution.
if
you
have
statutes
that
carefully
say
membership
plus
knowledge
is
criminal,
if
you
have
other
statutes
that
say
knowing
receipt
of
documents,
knowing
commission
of
acts
that
would
favor
the
establishment
of
a
foreign
dictatorship.
it
seems
to
me
very
unlikely
that
congress
would
go
to
all
this
trouble
to
enact
this
specific
provision,
which
bars
nothing
because
knowledge
is
specifically
stated.
and
another
reason,
if
i
may
supplement
that,
if
we
now
duel
to
congressional
purpose,
we've
been
dealing
basically
with
the
face
of
statute
up
to
now
and
what
one
can
derive
from
the
--
the
statute
in
its
terms.
but
if
we
now
look
to
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
statutes
as
very
plainly
shown
in
the
legislative
history,
the
kind
of
superabundance
of
caution
that
you
suggest,
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
would
have
accomplished
nothing
in
furtherance
of
the
congressional
purpose.
mr.
telford
taylor
if
they
were
showing
a
solicitude
about
this
whole
area,
justice
frankfurter,
and
in
the
course
of
that
solicitude
or
in
exploitation
of
it
were
undertaking
to
provide
a
statutory
bar
that
would
somehow
bolster
the
provisions,
the
registration
provisions.
an
interpretation
of
this
was
only
out
of
an
abundance
of
precaution
to
protect
against
the
prosecution
membership
without
knowledge
is
directly
contrary
to
the
--
to
the
thrust
of
that
--
of
that
inference.
now,
here,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
smith
act
has
been
on
the
books
for
10
years.
the
membership
clause
had
been
barely
used,
though
the
original
defendants
in
dennis
had
been
indicted
under
the
membership
clause
but
the
indictments
had
been
left
sit
there
where
they
still
are
and
there
haven't
been
the
other
great
deal
of
use
of
the
smith
act
itself.
congress
was
enacting
a
whole
new
statutory
scheme
to
deal
with
the
--
the
problems
presented
by
the
communist
party
and
to
some
more
organizations.
and
the
techniques
and
devices
that
they
have
used
here
involved
primarily
the
idea
of
registration
and
publicity
rather
than
prosecution.
there
are
to
be
sure
some
new
criminal
provisions
in
it
but
the
basic
framework
of
the
new
statute
revolves
around
the
registration.
we
know
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
government
doesn't
--
doesn't
at
all
contest
it.
that
the
main
purpose
of
4
(f)
was
to
--
was
to
bolster
and
prevent
those
registration
provisions
from
being
obstructed.
we
know
and
the
government
again
doesn't
contest
it
that
they
had
the
smith
act
specifically
in
mind
in
enacting
4
(f),
judiciary
committee
spoke
specifically
to
membership
clause.
therefore,
it's
plain
enough
that
the
purpose
was
to
--
to
bolster
registration
by
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
--
the
two
sentences
in
4
(f)
both
relate
to
the
possible
use
of
the
registration,
circumstance
registration
for
criminal
purposes
later
on.
it's
clear
enough
i
think,
justice
frankfurter
that
--
that
whether
this
provision
accomplishes
its
purpose,
whether
this
sufficient
bar
is
complicated
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
and
difficult,
independent
and
different
question.
and
because
there
is
question
about
that,
the
government
is
suggesting
that
this
should
be
construed
very
narrowly
to
this
bar.
but
that
question
has
been
faced
here
before.
the
very
same
argument
was
made
in
adams
against
maryland
not
very
many
years
ago,
where
you
had
the
congressional
--
the
effort,
the
old
effort
by
congress
to
protect
witnesses
before
congressional
committees
against
the
use
of
their
testimony
in
subsequent
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
telford
taylor
they
may
not
haven
known
this.
mr.
telford
taylor
they
may
not
have
known
this.
mr.
telford
taylor
but
because
they
didn't
--
because
they
learned
more
about
it
in
the
course
of
it,
justice
frankfurter,
they
made
the
provisions
very
different,
when
it
emerged
than
when
it
started.
they
became
aware
of
counselman
against
hitchcock
and
the
fact
that
that
second
sentence
was
by
no
means
enough.
they
put
in
the
first
one
because,
counselman
against
hitchcock
and
all
the
rest
of
the
doctrine
that
goes
with
it
had
been
called
the
attention
of
the
court
--
of
the
--
of
congress
by
--
by
john
w.
davis.
and
then
there
were
various
changes
in
that
provisions
that
went
through.
now,
to
say
that
what
has
been
done
here
in
a
plain
effort
to
assist
the
constitutionality
of
the
registration
provisions,
and
i
supposed
to
prevent
their
obstruction
by
pleas
itself.
to
say
that
congress,
in
an
effort
to
do
that,
wrote
a
bar
that
is
no
bar,
granted
a
protection
against
something
from
which
there
was
no
risk
to
begin
with,
because
there
is
no
statute
and
was
no
statute
that
prescribes
membership
without
knowledge,
no
such
thing
on
the
books,
and
it
isn't
a
matter
of
implication.
it's
written
right
in
there.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
this
is
or
it's
not
a
bar,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
the
counsel
having
that
case.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
why
the
first
sentence
came
in.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
why
the
first
sentence
was
added
because
the
second
one
was
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
ostentatiously
insufficient,
if
you
will
--
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
it
was
so
insufficient
that
there
was
need
for
more
year
and
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
think
that
--
that
this
is
--
has
pretty
well
covering
what
i
wanted
to
say
on
that
question,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
discuss
again
that
i
think
one
really
needs
going
no
further
than
the
face
of
statutes.
you
see
that
the
government's
position
here
is
--
is
not
sound.
one
cannot
speak
of
--
of
mere
membership
or
a
naked
membership
in
dealing
with
statute
that
talks
about
office
holding.
and
if
one
then
deals
with
office
holding
not
in
terms
of
what
it
necessarily
proves,
because
i
would
concede
immediately
that
the
fact
that
you
hold
office
doesn't
prove
that
you
have
knowledge
or
prove
anything
else
in
particular,
but
the
implications
to
be
drawn
from
congress
putting
that
phrase
in
there
and
what
they
probably
intended
by
is
quite
another
matter.
that
must
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
incredible
that
they
would
have
--
have
met
the
holding
of
office
without
knowledge
of
the
organization's
purposes
when
they
wrote
that
in.
it
doesn't
fit
with
the
rest
of
statute
and
it
doesn't
fit
with
the
congressional
purpose,
because
they
were
trying
to
write
a
bar
that
would
assist
and
protect
the
registration
provisions
and
if
you
construe
this
as
the
government
construed
that
they
wrote
no
bar
at
all,
nothing
that
bars
any
prosecution
that
brought
without
it.
now,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
pass
to
the
other
questions
in
the
court's
order.
the
other
four
paragraphs
of
the
court's
order
for
reargument
posed
nine
different
questions
with
respect
to
constitutionality.
and
it's
undeniable
that
most
of
these
questions
are
posed
by
the
case
as
it
has
developed
here.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
that
several
of
these
questions
arise
from
the
government's
decorative
work
on
the
statutes,
the
addition
of
new
elements
to
be
engrafted.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
the
government
has
been
obliged
by
the
pressure
of
the
issue
to
argue
based
on
--
on
the
things
to
be
added
to
the
statutes
is
some
indication
of
the
purview
of
the
case
here.
these
nine
questions
that
the
court
has
posed,
the
parties
had
dealt
with
those
in
supplemental
briefs.
i
couldn't
possibly
cover
each
of
the
nine
in
the
time
available
anyhow,
and
i
don't
want
to
weary
the
court's
arbitration
of
what's
in
the
briefs.
i
do
want
to
address
myself
to
several
of
them.
but
before
doing
that,
i'd
like
to
make
a
more
general
observation
about
the
constitutional
problem
here
because,
i
think,
there's
some
danger
that
if
we
deal
with
these
nine
questions
into
limited
way,
one
will
lose
sight
of
what
seems
to
me
a
more
basic
and
non-technical
factor
here
that
underlines
them
all.
the
smith
act
is
in
the
nature
--
is
in
the
nature
of
a
sedition
statute.
it,
therefore,
deals
with
what
have
been
called
"political
crimes",
political
crimes
like
treason
and
sedition.
in
defining
these
crimes
and
in
applying
them
when
people
have
been
prosecuted
for
the
commission,
both
the
legislatures
and
the
courts,
i
think,
had
been
aware
that
this
is
a
very
tricky
evidentiary
field,
tricky
field
in
an
evidentiary
sense.
and
that,
generally
speaking,
guilt
for
political
crimes
such
as
sedition
and
treason
should
be
based
on
evidence
of
the
accused
actual
conduct
rather
than
on
or
primarily
on
the
state
of
mind.
of
course,
this
does
not
obviate
the
necessity
for
evidence
about
state
of
mind
because
acts
which
maybe
quite
innocent,
done
with
one
intent
maybe
quite
guilty
or
maybe
treasonable
if
done
with
another,
same
acts
maybe
guilty
or
innocent
depending
on
the
intent.
nonetheless,
that
is
evidence
about
intent
coupled
with
and
related
to
proof
of
specific
conducts.
the
--
the
wariness
that
courts
and
legislatures
have
felt
about
political
crimes
that
rest
too
much
in
the
mind
is
reflected
in
the
formidable
writ
acts
of
treason
that
has
been
discussed
in
this
court's
opinion,
the
cramer
case
and,
by
the
way,
justice
jackson
dealt
this
case.
the
smith
act
and
other
statutes
the
court
has
had
to
deal
within
recent
years
that
are
in
this
general
field,
have
vexed
and
divided
the
court
because
they
raised
these
acute
problems
under
the
first
amendment.
those
that
have
been
upheld
have
been
statutes,
which
do
proscribe
seditious
activities
and
utterances
in
one
sort
of
another,
not
merely
a
state
of
mind.
smith
act
relates
to
advocacy,
distribution
of
literature.
taft-hartley,
filing
the
false
affidavits,
espionage
acts
to
other
kinds
of
conducts.
but
now,
when
we
come
to
membership
clause,
even
if
contrary
to
what
we
think
is
the
teaching
of
the
legislative
history
here,
even
if
we
do
read
in
the
additional
element
of
intent,
we
are
still
left
with
a
crime,
which
involves
nothing
but
the
circumstances
of
association
plus
state
of
mind.
it
--
and
adding
an
attempt
simply
adds
another
subjective
factor
that
what
is
already
a
very
subjective
crime.
under
the
membership
clause,
the
accused
is
not
charged
with
committing
or
attempting
or
conspiring
to
commit
any
seditious
act
or
utterance
at
all.
it's
the
matter
of
association
or
state
of
mind.
and
i
think
it
is
awareness
of
this
weakness
that
has
led
the
government
when
this
case
was
already
three
years
old
after
first
conviction
to
propose
this
requisite
of
activity
which
is
referred
to
in
question
number
three.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
no,
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
what
i
said
was
that
the
crime,
as
defined,
it
comes
down
to
association
plus
subjective
factors
of
state
of
mind,
knowledge
and
if
you
add
intent
--
intent.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
association
is
not
subjective.
neither
is
it
--
it
neither
is
a
specific
charge
of
conduct.
it
is
merely
a
relation
to
something
else.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
is
not
advocacy
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it's
only
state
of
mind.
mr.
telford
taylor
it's
not
merely
subjective.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
other
factors
are
merely
subjective
and
association
still
is
not
a
charge
of
criminal
conduct.
it's
charged
with
association
with
someone
else's
criminal
conduct.
therefore,
the
crime
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
the
elements
of
the
crime
are
association
plus
state
of
mind.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
law
has
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
the
law
has
dealt
with
associations
in
other
terms
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
has
dealt
with
in
terms
of
conspiracies
and
complicities.
these
are
the
techniques
by
which
the
law
has
endeavored
to
isolate
one
is
guilty
relation
to
a
crime.
mr.
telford
taylor
but
here
we
have
a
relationship
which
is
far
more
remote
than
the
quest
of
the
ones
in
the
law
such
as
conspiracy
or
complicity,
and
the
only
thing
that
is
added
to
that
association
are
subjective
factors.
it
is,
i
think,
undeniable
that
the
other
cases,
the
other
crimes
that
have
come
up
in
other
cases
here,
have
involved
charges
of
specific
conduct
such
as
advocacy,
organizing,
distributing
literature,
filing
false
affidavits,
trying
to
obstruct
the
drafts,
somebody
is
doing
something
that
they
ought
not
to
do.
now,
here,
we
have
a
much
more
remote
thing
and
all
i
am
saying
this
point
for
the
moment
is
to
indicate
that
awareness
of
this
ephemeral
quality
in
the
crime
as
defining
the
membership
clause
is
what
has
pushed
the
government
toward
the
interjection
in
this
element
of
--
of
activity,
to
try
to
give
the
crime
some
more
substance
and
concrete
reality
than
it
has
in
the
--
on
the
congress
to
find
it
in.
now,
does
the
addition
of
this
factor
of
activity
help
unconstitutionality?
if
the
government
proposed,
reading
into
the
clause,
a
requirement
of
some
kind
of
activity
in
furtherance
of
the
advocacy
that
the
smith
act
condemns
or
in
assistance
of
the
advocacy
that
smith
act
condemns.
we
would
have
a
different
situation
here.
if
a
defendant
were
so
charged
with
activity
in
aid
of
the
advocacy
of
the
unlawful
advocacy,
then
he
might
be,
in
any
event,
guilty
of
complicity
as
a
principal
or
an
accomplice.
if
he
engaged
in
activity
pursuant
to
some
kind
of
an
agreement
with
others
that
is
charged
or
proved,
then
you
will
make
out
a
case
of
conspiracy.
but,
if
i
am
at
a
loss
to
see,
how
a
charge
of
activity
that
is
not
related
to
the
thing
the
statute
is
getting
at,
which
is
the
advocacy,
shows
any
culpable
connection.
now,
the
government
answers
that
in
their
supplemental
brief
on
reargument
by
saying
that
any
activity
indirectly
supports
and
assists
the
unlawful
advocacy,
that
even
though
the
communist
party
member
spends
all
of
his
time
going
around
distributing
copies
of
the
stockholm
peace
appeal
or
something
on
which
opinion
certainly
might
defer
but
is
not
guilty
advocacy
of
any
kinds.
that
conduct
of
that
kind
of
normal
party
activity
promotes
and
indirectly
supports
the
unlawful
advocacy
and
that
is
the
reason
they
say
that
to
add
this
requirement
of
activity
will
sufficiently
assist
the
constitutionality
of
the
courts.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
argument
proves
too
much,
that
its
acceptance
would
greatly
large
the
possible
bounds
of
criminal
liability
in
this
field,
and
would
make
very
deepen
roads
on
the
constitutional
guarantees.
quite
apart
from
those
general
observations
about
this
argument,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
--
it
applies
squarely
in
the
face
of
two
decisions
of
this
court,
one
quite
recent,
those
two
decisions
being
the
de
jonge
case
and
the
yates
case.
in
the
de
jonge
case,
after
all,
the
--
it
was
not
disputed
that
the
organization
involved
there
was
engaged
in
criminal
advocacy.
maybe
it
was,
maybe
it
wasn't
but
on
the
appeal
to
this
court,
that
was
assumed.
it
was
assumed
that
the
organization
was
engaged
in
an
unlawful
advocacy,
and
it
was
charged
against
de
jonge
that
he
assisted
in
the
conduct
of
a
communist
meeting,
spoke
at
it,
spoke
at
length.
what
he
said
is
set
forth
in
length
in
the
stipulation
and
it
was
charged
that
it
could
be
made
a
crime
to
assist
in
the
conduct
of
the
meeting
under
the
hospices
of
an
organization
engaging
in
an
unlawful
advocacy.
certainly,
it
could
have
suggested
well
there
that
what
de
jonge
did
indirectly
supported
the
unlawful
teachings
of
the
party.
indeed,
in
that
very
case,
it
was
charged
that
de
jonge
had
urged
everybody
to
come
to
a
meeting
the
next
night
in
order
to
show
defiance
to
the
police
and
support
the
revolutionary
activities
of
the
party.
he
was
not
charged
in
the
indictments.
therefore,
the
court
said,
as
charged
in
the
indictments,
this
is
insufficient.
it
seems
to
us
the
yates
case
is
--
is
equally
cutting
on
--
on
this
argument.
the
court
there
distinguished
very
carefully
between
those
defendants
against
whom
the
court
thought
the
evidence
was
so
insufficient
that
there
should
not
even
be
opportunity
for
another
trial
and
those
that
were
sent
back
for
another
trial,
which
the
government
never
chose
to
proceed
with.
and
in
distinguishing
between
those
two
subsequent
defendants,
certainly,
it
wasn't
on
the
ground
of
activity
in
general,
and
indeed
those
five
defendants
that
were
acquitted,
were
exceedingly
active
members
of
the
party.
and
the
--
the
point
goes
even
further
than
that,
because
in
the
case
of
the
defendant
richmond,
the
court
specifically
noted
that
there
was
evidence
connecting
richmond
with
the
other
conspirators
including
conspirators
who
might
have
been
engaged
in
the
unlawful
advocacy.
richmond
had
been
the
editor
of
the
party
newspaper
on
the
west
coast
for
a
period
of
many
years.
he
was
functionary
of
--
of
great
importance
in
that
sense.
the
court
said
his
activity
did
not
show
anything
but
lawful
and
therefore,
in
--
even
though
there
was
evidence
of
association
with
the
other
conspirators
including
those
that
might
be
guilty
of
unlawful
advocacy,
this
was
held
not
enough.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful,
in
analyzing
the
constitutional
problem
at
this
point,
to
spend
a
minute
on
how
the
court
below,
which
included
eminent
and
distinguished
judges
like
judge
parker
and
others,
how
did
they
so
easily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
clause
is
constitutional.
well,
it
--
its
scholarly
sense
is
rather
interesting.
in
judge
parker's
view
ever
since
--
before
the
scales
case,
he
had
taken
the
position
that
association
plus
knowledge
is
the
same
thing
as
conspiracy.
and
in
his
opinion
after
the
first
conviction
in
this
case,
he
said
in
substance
that
this
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government.
of
course,
that
view
reduces
the
membership
clause
to
redundancy,
because
if
it's
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
overthrow,
we
are
really
right
back
with
the
other
portions
of
the
smith
act.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
also
overlooked
the
distinction
between
the
conspiracy
to
overthrow
and
the
conspiracy
to
advocate.
but
more
important
than
all
of
that
is
that
judge
parker's
particular
view
of
this
matter
of
conspiracy
is
a
matter
that's
been
debated
in
the
law
institute
for
a
number
of
years.
his
position,
which
opened
up
the
concept
of
conspiracy
in
his
very
broad
way
is
one
that
is
not
wanted
favor
and
that
has
been
specifically
rejected
by
the
law
institute.
the
citations
are
in
our
reply
brief
filed
earlier
this
week.
and
i
think
that
the
government's
defense
of
the
membership
clause
leads
into
this
same
cul
de
sac.
the
government
is
now
here
in
the
position
of
defending
this
clause
primarily
on
the
basis
of
two
elements,
intent
and
activity,
neither
of
which
is
specified
in
the
statute,
and
one
of
which
isn't
even
charged
in
the
indictment.
the
development
of
their
defense
of
this
clause
is,
i
think,
insignificant.
the
first
membership
indictments
that
were
filed
in
1948
do
not
charge
specific
intent.
that
comes
in
in
1954
when
the
scales
and
noto
and
other
indictments
are
quashed.
then
after
the
scales
case
has
come
up
once,
three
years
later,
the
government
proposes
the
addition
of
the
factor
of
activity.
still,
there
seem
to
be
problems,
and
therefore,
we
find
in
the
government's
brief
these
other
efforts
to
--
to
invite
the
court
to
hold
the
statute
constitutional
as
applied
in
this
case
on
the
theory
that
this
petitioner
was
high
level,
rigidly
disciplined,
and
that
there
is
proof
to
the
party
is
a
deeply
conspirational
party.
well,
now,
when
we
come
to
that
point,
it's
clear
enough
--
the
government
is
right
--
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon
me.
mr.
telford
taylor
i'm
simply
referring
to
indictments
that
have
been
filed.
those
were
the
first
indictments
in
1948.
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
they
are
still
there
in
the
files
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
have
never
been
pressed.
nevertheless,
those
indictments,
to
my
understanding,
did
not
include
intent.
the
1954
indictments
added
that
and
then
comes
activity
in
1957
and
--
mr.
telford
taylor
oh,
no,
no.
no,
justice
clark.
when
--
when
--
mr.
telford
taylor
1954
was
an
indictment
in
this
case.
the
1948
indictment
i
was
talking
about
was
the
one
in
the
--
in
new
york.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
--
that's
correct,
just
one
in
this
case.
when
we
are
back
to
this
position
of
urging
affirmance
here
or
sustaining
the
statutes
on
the
ground
that
the
party
is
deeply
conspirational,
then
we
have
come
right
back
to
judge
parker's
position
that
the
court
has
been
asked
primarily
to
uphold
this
as
being
the
same
thing
as
a
charge
of
conspiracy.
well,
that
position
runs
into
the
same
conformities,
statutory
redundancy,
ignoring
the
tradition
on
its
conspiracy
etcetera.
the
government's
presentation
of
--
of
the
constitutionality
issue,
if
i'm
not
being
too
irreverent,
it
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
the
--
the
cook
who
is
standing
over
his
stew
on
the
stove
and
from
time
to
time,
he
sips
the
stew
to
see
if
it's
seasoned
enough,
but
it
never
seems
to
be
quite
strong
though.
so
after
each
sip,
the
government
cook
reaches
for
some
other
ingredient
to
throw
in
the
pot
to
see
if
it
will
make
it
strong
enough.
but
now
the
last
three
ingredients
have
come
in
in
the
government's
last
brief.
the
court
has
now
been
invited,
page
27
of
their
brief.
even
if
they
doubt
that
the
statute
might
be
constitutional
in
other
applications
to
uphold
it
as
applied
to
a
dedicated
fulltime
proselytizing
communist
and
hold
it
constitutional
in
that
application.
well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
petitioner
was
or
was
not
a
proselytizing
communist.
he
certainly
wasn't
charged
with
being
and
i
recall
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
received
into
the
party
those
gentlemen
at
the
fbi
sent
him
to
be
admitted
to
the
party,
but
there's
no
evidence
that
he
was
a
wide-scale
recruiter.
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
really
had
anything
to
do
with
the
case
at
all.
but
certainly,
there's
no
issue.
they
never
went
to
the
jury
about
whether
or
not
he's
a
proselytizing
communist
fulltime.
well,
there's
no
doubt.
in
the
record,
it
shows
that
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
on
party
activities,
but
i
don't
know
exactly
what
a
fulltime
communist
is
if
--
if
it
means
the
same
thing
at
elsewhere.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
was
a
fulltime
communist.
all
of
us
spend
our
time
a
lot
of
different
ways.
i
sometimes
will
put
to
a
doubt
as
to
whether
i'm
a
fulltime
lawyer.
but
how
will
that
may
be?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
now
to
invite
a
holding
of
--
of
constitutional
application
based
on
adjectives
and
limitations
of
this
sort
and
it
reduces
the
whole
presentation
to
an
absurdity.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
more
words
on
the
--
on
the
matter
of
activity,
the
third
question
stated
in
the
court's
order
for
reargument,
because
i
do
have
a
feeling
that
the
government
is
pending
its
main
hoax
of
upholding
the
statute
on
--
on
the
proposed
addition
of
this
factor.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
court's
order
for
reargument,
several
subsidiary
questions
are
raised.
it's
asked
whether
the
statute
--
whether
the
--
the
membership
clause
will
be
valid
without
activity
as
a
new
element
of
the
crime
but
as
a
constitutional
overlaid
standards,
something
like
"clear
and
present
danger".
this
was
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
in
1957.
i
confess
i
have
been
unable
to
fathom
this
idea
of
the
activity.
if
it's
to
be
brought
in
the
case
at
all,
it
should
be
brought
in
as
a
--
as
a
constitutional
standard
like
clear
and
present
danger
that
doesn't
go
to
the
jury.
of
course,
there
has
been
divided
opinion
about
whether
the
clear
and
present
danger
issue
should
or
should
not
be
kept
away
from
the
jury
but
the
reasons
for
doing
it
were
pretty
clearly
set
forth
in
the
various
opinions
in
the
dennis
case.
we
need
to
take
account
of
a
very
wide
area
of
factual
and
circumstantial
data,
the
need
for
uniformity
of
outcome,
and
so
forth,
but
the
issue
of
activity
is
nothing
like
that.
if
there
is
any
proper
issue
of
activity
in
this
case,
this
is
a
matter
that
concerns
the
individual
behavior
of
one
man,
the
defendant.
it's
a
kind
of
issue
that
juries
traditionally
deal
with.
and
if
that
issue
can
be
taken
from
the
jury,
i
should
suppose
that
the
question
of
whether
the
mails
were
used
in
fraud
or
any
other
factual
issue
could
equally
be
taken
away
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
jury
trial.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
justice
harlan.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
the
first
part
is
the
blue
sheet.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
the
supplemental
brief.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
that's
the
only
document.
mr.
telford
taylor
not
that
i
know
of.
i
--
i
hope
i
will
soon
find
it
if
there
is
but
the
only
that's
--
that
i
have
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
been
given
access
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
telford
taylor
finally,
on
this
matter
of
the
constitutional
standard,
if
the
activity
is
to
be
so
regarded,
my
bewilderment
is
--
is
completed
by
the
fact
that
--
that
the
trial
judge
here
may
know
such
finding
at
the
government's
request.
this
matter
of
activity
went
to
the
jury.
so
charged
by
the
judge
and
went
to
the
jury
and
jury
questioned.
and
so
if
this
is
a
thing
which
like
clear
and
present
danger
should
have
been
found
by
the
--
by
the
trial
court,
it
never
was.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
if
we're
going
to
look
to
activity
at
all,
the
--
the
side
of
this
which
must
be
taken
more
seriously
is
the
idea
of
activity
as
an
element
of
the
crime.
now,
even
there,
i
think
some
clarification
is
needed.
as
justice
frankfurter
indicated
earlier
in
the
argument,
proof
of
membership
itself
involves
some
kind
of
indicia
of
membership.
this
may
involve
some
proof
of
activity.
the
court
has
dealt
with
the
question
of
what
membership
is
as
used
in
these
statutes.
it
isn't
necessarily
always
the
same
thing.
the
nature
of
the
statute
may
affect
it.
but
in
galvan
against
press,
the
court
mentioned
such
things
as
occasional
attendance
of
meetings,
payment
dues,
and
so
forth.
therefore,
if
the
government
meant
only
that
proof
of
membership
may
entail
proof
of
some
activity,
i
suppose
nobody
could
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
but
if
they
meant
only
that,
then
it
would
not
import
any
new
element
to
the
statute.
it
would
not
do
what
they
appear
to
hope
would
be
accomplished,
that
is,
inject
a
new
element
in
the
strength
of
its
constitutionality.
and
therefore,
elsewhere
and
indeed,
in
the
--
in
the
court's
charge
with
the
jury,
it's
quite
clear
that
what
they
really
mean
is
a
requirement
of
a
greater
degree
of
activity
than
would
be
necessary
to
prove
membership.
this
is
an
additional
element
or
additional
proof.
and
their
last
brief,
although
as
i
say
in
some
spots,
speaks
about
an
interpretation
of
the
word
"membership";
in
other
places,
it's
quite
clear
that
they
mean
proof
of
something
more
than
is
necessary
to
show
membership.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
believe
that
is
true.
but
--
unless
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
that
is
why
they
--
mr.
telford
taylor
in
that
event,
it's
no
more
activity
than
any
member
would
--
would
engage
in.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
it
seems
to
me
there
had
been
two
or
three
questions
there,
justice
harlan.
i
believe
that
the
reason
they
put
for
the
idea
of
constitutional
standard
was
in
order
to
meet
our
argument
about
the
indictment.
all
right.
i've
dealt
with
the
constitutional
standard
part
of
it
already.
now,
we
come
to
the
thing
as
an
element
of
proof.
it
can
be
one
or
two
things.
it
can
be
how
much
activity
do
you
need
to
prove
to
establish
membership
or
are
we
construing
the
statutes
that
when
it
says
"membership",
it
means
especially
active
membership,
membership
more
active
than
is
necessary
merely
to
be
a
member.
i
think
they
mean
the
latter.
they
--
they
say
in
several
places,
the
new
element
of
proof,
i
think
the
court's
question
number
three
was
phrased
in
terms
of
an
additional
element
of
defense.
perhaps,
an
illustration
would
be
helpful
here.
suppose
you
have
a
statute
that
punishes
displaying
a
red
flag
in
public.
how
red
does
the
flag
have
to
be?
how
big
does
it
have
to
be?
how
public
must
a
display
be?
well,
it
obviously
must
be
read
enough
to
be
unmistakably
read
and
it's
got
to
be
big
enough
so
it's
plainly
a
flag
and
not
a
handkerchief.
and
it's
got
to
be
displayed
where
the
public
can
get
access
to
it.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
any
particular
shade
of
red
or
any
special
size.
but
the
government's
apportion
of
the
statute,
you
would,
as
if,
you
would
say
that
to
display
a
blood
red
flag
more
than
10
feet
square
by
brandishing
on
the
capital
steps
is
what
the
statute
really
means.
this
means
membership
accompanied
by
a
degree
of
activity
more
than
enough
to
prove
membership,
especially
active
membership.
mr.
telford
taylor
in
this
specific
case
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
justice
stewart,
those
were
to
be
found
in
the
record
at
i
think
page
841.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
the
way
it
appears
to
me.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
--
the
entire
paragraph
is
to
be
found
in
the
record
at
page
841.
and
if
the
court
says
the
defendant
admits
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
--
for
the
membership
to
be
criminal,
however,
it
is
not
sufficient
to
be
simply
a
member.
it
must
be
more
than
nominal,
passive,
inactive,
or
technical.
in
determining
whether
he
was
active
or
inactive,
consider
how
much
of
his
time
and
efforts
he
devoted
for
it.
to
be
active,
he
must
have
devoted
all
or
a
substantial
part
of
his
time
to
party
activities.
well,
it
seems
to
me
they're
pretty
clear
that
that
is
intended
to
mean
more
activity
than
would
be
necessary
to
merely
to
prove
membership.
i
get
the
same
attempts
from
the
government's
brief,
last
brief,
supplemental
brief,
justice
harlan,
at
pages
24
and
25.
if
all
that
were
involved
were
bare
membership
or
bare
membership
plus
some
attendance
of
party
meetings.
and
then
further
down
on
page
25,
they
answered
to
the
first
branch
of
the
court's
question.
it
is
that
adding
the
element
of
activity,
adding
the
element
of
activity
does
aid.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
possible.
that
is
possible
but
unless,
unless
activity
is
being
added
here
as
something
more
than
just
that
degree
of
proof
which
is
necessary
to
establish
membership
as
commonly
understood,
then
i
can't
see
that
anything
is
being
accomplished
in
the
way
of
the
government's
purpose
of
bolstering
the
statute
by
a
new
element.
then
we're
right
back
where
we
were
before,
proof
of
--
of
membership
with
the
attributes
that
would
normally
go
with
membership,
attendance
at
some
meetings,
payments
to
some
dues,
etcetera.
is
that
degree
of
activity
a
thing
which
brings
the
defendant
closer
to
the
forbidden
advocacy
in
the
smith
act?
i
hardly
see
how
it
can
be
under
the
decision
that
i've
indicated.
if
we,
however,
regarded
as
an
additional
element,
then
we
run
into
all
these
other
problems
that
i
have
indicated
before.
it's
not
charged
in
the
indictments.
we
run
at
the
problems
of
vagueness,
i
think.
what
standard
do
we
relate
to
when
we're
looking
for
this
question
of
activity?
and
anyhow,
it
seems
to
me
impossible
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
it
seems
to
me
impossible
enough
with
--
with
the
intent
problem
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history.
but
if
we're
going
to
--
to
build
one
thing
after
another
into
the
statutes,
this
is
entirely
contrary
to
the
approach
the
court
has
normally
taken
towards
the
statutes.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
said
at
the
outset
that
i
would
have
like
to
spend
some
time
on
the
other
issues
not
covered
in
the
order
of
reargument.
i
see
as
the
bulk
of
my
time
has
expired
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
for
4
(f)
and
then
about
activity
and
finally,
justice
douglas
from
my
vantage
point
though,
because
i'm
unable
to
see
that
doctrine
that
you
were
showing
mr.
davis,
which
one
is
it.
mr.
telford
taylor
right.
i
will
come
to
that
later
(inaudible).
on
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
on
section
4
(f)
and
the
statutory
bar.
mr.
davis
mentioned
section
17
of
the
internal
security
act
which
says
that
the
foregoing
provision
shall
be
construed
as
being
in
addition
to
and
not
a
modification
of
existing
criminal
statutes.
i
don't
believe
that
that
provision
cuts
one
way
or
the
other
on
our
point
of
disagreement
here.
that
is
a
general
provision
which
i
believe
was
on
the
statutory
draft
long
before
4
(f)
came
in
and
started
to
get
modified.
in
any
event
i
don't
see
how
that
general
thing
which
is
common
to
many
other
statutes
could
possibly
prevail
over
this
specific
provisions
in
4
(f),
we
talked
about
any
other
criminal
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
is
not
advanced
one
way
or
another
by
reference
to
that.
the
other
thing
on
4
(f)
that
mr.
davis
spoke
of
that
i
do
want
to
say
something
about,
is
his
argument
relating
to
4
(a)
and
4
(c)
of
the
internal
security
act?
if
i
understood
him
right,
he
is
suggesting
that
if
my
point
of
view
is
correct
that
a
communist
can't
be
prosecuted
as
such
under
the
membership
clause
that
the
same
thing
would
apply
under
4
(a)
and
4
(c).
i
do
not
believe
that
to
be
--
to
be
true.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
communists
and
so
communism
would
be
read
out
of
either
the
smith
act
or
the
internal
security
act.
what
we
have
in
4
(f)
is
two
things.
you
would
have
an
evidentiary
bar
in
the
2nd
section
which
is
the
second
sentence
which
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
is
under
the
counselman
rule,
plainly
insufficient.
and
because
of
that,
you
would
then
have
the
interpolation
of
the
first
sentence
which
is
not
an
evidentiary
bar
but
is
an
immunity
from
prosecution
provision
and
the
question
is
what
is
it
breadth?
that
--
that
is
the
question.
now,
under
4
(a)
of
the
internal
security
act,
the
crime
is
knowingly
to
combine,
conspire
or
agree
with
any
other
person
to
perform
an
act
which
would
substantially
contribute
the
establishment
of
a
total
--
totalitarian
dictatorship.
would
an
indictment
be
valid
which
charged
that
the
so
and
so
combined,
conspired
and
agreed
to
perform
an
act
in
that
he
became
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
no,
the
bar
would
apply.
i
think
it
would
also
apply
if
it
went
to
charge
that
if
he
became
a
member
of
the
communist
party
knowing
it's
purposes,
that
still
isn't
enough
to
constitute
a
crime
under
4
(a).
we
have
the
word
knowingly
in
there.
the
bar
in
other
words
is
a
bar
to
indicting
somebody
under
4
(a),
4
(c),
advocacy
clause
of
the
smith
act,
membership
clause
of
smith
act
on
the
basis
of
office
holding.
the
differences
that
in
4
(a)
and
4
(c)
you
have
to
accuse
a
person
of
some
kind
of
conduct
just
as
you
do
in
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
smith
act
whereas
the
bar
is
coextensive
with
the
membership
clause.
it
isn't
coextensive
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act.
it
isn't
coextensive
with
4
(a)
and
4
(c)
but
it
is
in
our
view
coextensive
with
the
membership
clause
and
it
also
operates
to
bar
prosecutions
under
4
(a)
or
4
(c)
unless
they
go
far
enough
to
charge
some
conduct
other
than
the
office
held
in
an
election.
on
activity,
i
must
confess
that
i
am
left
with
the
laws
now
on
what
kind
of
activity
is
enough.
mr.
davis
said,
if
i
understood
him
right
that
he
now
agrees
that
there
must
be
both
intent
and
activity
to
validate
the
statute.
is
attendance
at
party
meetings
enough?
i
understood
him
to
say
yes.
but
i
look
at
the
government's
brief
and
i
see
at
the
top
of
page
25
that
the
--
if
all
that
were
involved
were
bear
membership
plus
some
attendance
in
party
meetings,
there
would
be
more
foundation
to
the
argument
if
the
de
jonge
case
applies.
this
argument
disappears
when
the
requirement
of
activity
is
added
and
i
construed
that
previously
to
mean
that
attendance
at
party
meetings
wouldn't
be
enough.
he
said,
i
believe
that
paying
dues
is
enough
and
mention
is
made
of
the
rowoldt
case
but
i
have
here
the
swift
opinion
in
the
rowoldt
case
and
i
gathered
that
there,
although
the
petitioner
pay
dues,
attended
meetings
and
even
worked
in
a
communist
bookstore
--
bookstore
that
that
was
being
not
enough
for
purposes
of
that
statute
because
there
was
not
enough
of
a
--
of
a
mental
of
tie
with
the
party.
so
that
the
--
mr.
telford
taylor
they
are
two
different
things.
mr.
telford
taylor
they
are
two
different
things.
but
if
i
read
that
case
rightly,
attendance
at
the
meetings
and
payment
of
party
dues
is
not
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
establish
membership
in
the
party
in
the
sense
of
that
statute.
mr.
telford
taylor
but
i
think
when
mr.
davis
is
speaking
of
activity
he's
not
speaking
of
the
mind.
its
--
i
think
justice
frankfurter,
you
pointed
out,
activity
is
something
outside
of
the
mind.
mr.
telford
taylor
true.
but
if
we
then
say
he
must
also
the
acting
--
i
don't
read
the
rowoldt
case
is
saying
that
this
activity
is
indicative
that
much
--
no
way
of
a
connection.
may
i
make
one
another
point
about
it,
justice
frankfurter?
this
talk
about
activities
seems
to
me
to
utterly
overlook
the
facts
that
the
membership
clause
itself
covers
affiliates
as
well
as
members
or
becomes
or
is
a
member
of
or
affiliates
with
any
such
society.
now,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
it
was
held
that
affiliation
exist
without
activity.
if
congress
meant
to
cover
affiliation
which
certainly
is
a
lesser
and
looser
degree
connection
than
--
than
membership,
it
was
put
in
there
to
cover
a
lesser
and
looser
degree
of
connection.
it
seems
to
me
the
implication
of
that
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
need
a
particularly
high
standard
of
activity
as
a
requisite
of
membership.
because
if
they
have
they
would
not
have
extended
the
statute
also
to
cover
affiliates.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
could.
this
court
has
said
that
it
means
something
less
than
membership
and
more
of
the
sympathy.
also,
it
certainly
seems
to
me
the
implications
of
that
word
are
less
activity
than
--
than
membership
would
apply.
and
that
is
say
what
was
held
in
the
ninth
circuit.
my
time
has
expired.
if
the
court
desires,
i'll
be
glad
to
comment
on
--
on
what
happened
on
that
pamphlet.
here,
mr.
justice
douglas
made
mention
of.
when
i
do
not
have
nothing
else
to
say,
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
douglas
that
pamphlet
is
one
of
three
which
was
offered
during
the
trial
by
the
prosecution
to
prove
incitement
by
the
communist
party.
it
was
offered
specifically
by
--
for
that
purpose.
it
was
subjected
to
by
the
defense
on
the
ground
that
it
doesn't
build
an
incitement,
that
it
is
indeed
abusive,
intemperant
in
its
language,
and
all
those
things
but
as
was
observed
by
judge
learned
hand
of
the
masses
and
patten
case,
to
be
abusive
is
not
necessarily
to
incitement
to
violent
overthrown.
it
was
then
held
before
the
jury
as
--
and
the
jury
was
asked
to
find
incitement
on
the
basis
of
that
particular
pamphlet.
the
defense
then
asked
the
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
could
not
find
incitement,
unlawful
action
on
the
basis
only
of
the
--
of
documents
which
criticized
government
policy,
i
believe
that
was
very
severely.
so
that
document
played
a
very
nature
share.
indeed,
it
is
one
of
the
principal
thing
that
the
government
relied
on
to
differentiate
the
evidence
in
this
case
from
the
evidence
in
the
yates
case.
we
say
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
that
isn't
in
the
yates
case,
the
record
is
basically
no
different.
this
is
one
of
the
major
efforts
to
make
it
and
i
have
argued
in
our
supplemental
brief
the
importance
of
that.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
judge
did
not
grant
the
instruction
we
requested.
he
denied
it.
