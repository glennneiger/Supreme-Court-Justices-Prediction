frankfurter
surely,
if
you're
right
about
last,
we
don't
have
to
consider
the
former.
so,
it
isn't
at
the
core
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
i
am
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
lawyers
usually
start
with
the
farther
streets
instead
of
the
one
that
could
dispose
of
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
answer
to
all
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
expressing
my
disagreement
with
the
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
even
think
privately
that
you
know
better.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
we
actually
would
have
to
read
in
more
into
this
statute
than
the
court
read
into
the
screws
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
showing
of
that,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
--
did
he
charge
then
that
they
could
find
on
this
evidence
alone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
did
he
--
or
did
he
reject
your
charge
on
the
ground
that
that
was
otherwise
taken
cared
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
this
charge
--
this
case
was
given
to
the
jury
without
a
survey,
an
unbiased
fair
survey
of
the
evidence
of
both
sides?
this
is
just
an
abstract
--
one
of
those
awful
abstract
unguiding
charges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
the
reason
i
asked
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
said
he
didn't
--
he
thought
it
would
go
into
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
get
that
but,
just
for
my
own
information,
i
want
to
know
because
i
neatly
disapprove
of
this
abstract
charges
to
jury,
i
want
to
know
whether
this
complicated
case
was
left
to
the
jury
merely
on
generalities
about
reasonable
doubt
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
been
on
to
the
school
that
thinks
that
nothing
is
felt
about
the
worst
way.
that
could
be
one
of
the
worst
errors
in
the
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
need
some
more
clarification.
if
the
judge
didn't
leave
with
any
evidence
in
the
sense
that
i've
indicated,
then
i
--
then
i
can
--
he
can
--
then
the
ground
on
which
he
rejected
the
charge
is
a
valid
ground
unless
you
take
the
broader
ground
that
it's
his
duty
to
fairly
lay
out
the
evidence
for
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
why
should
he
pick
one
piece
of
evidence
rather
than
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that,
he
had
to
rule.
he
ruled
on
that
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
speech
by
the
--
by
the
u.s.
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
put
it
to
you,
if
--
if
you
ask
him
to
negate
it
that
they
may
not
find
him
guilty
on
this
specific
evidence,
you
have
a
right
and
ask
him
to
negate
it
that
they
couldn't
find
on
any
--
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
several
items
and,
contrary-wise,
the
government
may
ask
the
court
to
charge
that
they
couldn't
find
on
this
or
that
or
not
--
could
withhold
findings,
and
that's
one
of
the
difficulties,
in
my
point
of
view,
of
giving
more
of
this
to
me
or
pay
the
uninformative
charges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
did
ask
him
if
they
couldn't
find
on
this
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
you
make
the
same
request
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
many
of
the
items?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a30?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
6
or
7?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
they
could
accomplish
that
by
not
calling
--
by
not
bringing
in
the
clause
of
immunity
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
accomplish
that
result
by
not
availing
themselves
of
this
1950
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
they
did,
but
i
mean
they
--
they
would
not
--
what
you
are
saying
is
the
1950
act
automatically
goes
into
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
duty
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
immunity
is
part
of
the
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
isn't
a
case
where
the
district
attorney
has
to
say
“you
must
testify.
you
must
incriminate
yourself
because
you
get
immunity
in
exchange.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
the
trial,
mr.
taylor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
is
the
--
are
the
stenographic
minutes
of
the
trial
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
how
many
pages
are
there,
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
between
you
and
the
government,
is
there
available
--
are
there
available
more
than
several
stets
of
the
stenographic
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
one
already
in
the
clerk's
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
one
in
the
clerk's
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
the
government
would
be
generous
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
--
do
i
gather
that,
in
view
of
your
mention
of
it
a
minute
ago,
i
gather
that
the
criterion
for
determining
whether
a
person
charged
comes
within
this
feature
of
the
smith
act
is
one
that
you
take
over
from
the
rowoldt
case
or
what
was
said
in
colyer
against
skeffington?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
not
be
as
useful
but,
to
make
a
distinction,
it
recognizes
that
there
are
members
and
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around
is
the
important
thing
that
merely
--
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
other
way
around
that
merely
being
a
member
in
any
formal,
or
technical,
or
associative
sense
isn't
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
say
so,
those
cases
drew
on
colyer
and
skeffington
because,
there,
there
was
a
more
detailed
analysis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
cannot
raise
it
too
highly
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
aid
enough
to
buy
the
liquor
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you
are
--
all
you
are
dealing
with
now,
on
this
line
of
argument,
goes
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
trying
to
label
it.
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
even
saying
that.
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
he
wanted
to
overstate
it
to
put
the
first
position
in,
didn't
he?
he
didn't
want
to
subordinate
all
of
the
arguments
in
the
case
to
the
main
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
would
this
speech
from
which
you've
quoted
say
this
--
would
that
speech
tied
to
or
in
any
way
tied
to
the
petitioner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
get
it.
it
says
on
the
page
before,
“was
scales
with
you
at
anytime
--
at
the
time
you
always
had
it?”
“yes,

“when
was
that?”
“that
was
at
a
speech

gave
on
thursday,
wednesday
night
--
thursday
and

night
at
chapel
hill.”
who
gave
the
speech?
the
record
is
a
little
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
that
was
--
that
referred
--
he
was
tied
up
--
justice

the
same
man,
that's
what
i
--
justice

one
would
have
to
read.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
do.
that
would
have
to
read
the

this
speech
from
which
you
quoted
was
at
chapel
hill.
where
did
it
say
it
was
made
the
next
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
made
easy.
justice
felix

that's
what
i
regard
as
the
chapel
hill.
justice
felix

that's
why
--
justice

that's
why
i
think
it's
a
wonderful
rule
--
justice

well,
i
think
this
may
show
there's
some
disadvantages
in

and
i
was
reading

you
don't

in
which

of

justice

what
you
are
saying
is
that
all
the

has
prayed
may
give
good
grounds
for
saving
a
person
from
playing
the
different
punishments.
the
valid
basis
for
attacking
the
duty
to
register
under
the
act
because
the
immunity
isn't
coextensive,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
straight
counselman
versus
hitchcock
that
would
be
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
should
mean
that
senators
had
shown
them
their
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
a
little
behind
the
type
of
opinion
in
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
never
stop
lawyers
by
taking
one
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
then
we
say
you're
limited
to
question
of
the
(inaudible)
justice

frankfurter
were
the
excised
portions
were
before
the
court?
what's
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice

--
full

justice

were
all
to
--
did
the
government
submit
the
reports
of
physical
full
contents
and
of
physically
excised
contents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
the
court
grant
the
--
all
the
excisions
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
shows
that
the
court
eminently
went
over
and
excer
--
and
whether
--
but
the
court
did
examine
the
originals,
in
relation
to
the
testimony,
as
to
which
potentially
impeachment
would
result.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
and
the
claim
here
is
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
entire
document
without
explanation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning,
for
them
to
decide
what
is
and
what
is
not
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
that
--
does
that
phrase
“step
in
preparation”
with
affirmation
to
the
law”
attempt
--
that's
a
question
of
causalities,
remoteness,
in
other
words,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
qualify
to
buy
some
matches
in
order,
eventually,
to
use
those
matches
to
light
something
that
may
be
a
little
remote,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
finally
caught
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
the
question
of
doing
--
about
the
whitney
case
and
its
bearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you,
naturally
enough,
find
this
great
comfort
in
the
opinion
--
the
concurring
opinion.
as
i
recall
the
case,
and
i
now
read
the
opinion
and
i
now
reread
it,
a
comfort
of
this
kind,
it
concerns
--
it
tells
of
two
matters
or,
rather,
it
involved
two
matters
that
are
relevant
to
the
problem
in
this
case,
namely,
the
responsibility
of
mrs.--
of
ms.
whitney
in
that
case
that
gives
here,
through
membership,
what
responsibilities,
particularly
what
criminal
responsibilities,
may
be
derived
from
or
attributable
to
membership
and,
secondly,
membership
in
what,
namely,
the
organization
in
which
there
is
membership?
now,
to
my
reading,
to
my
understanding
of
justice
brandeis'
concurrence,
he
was
concerned,
and
gave
clear
expression
to
his
view,
that
an
organization
expanses
proletarian
uprising
or
revolution
far
in
the
future
is
not
an
organization
who
that
impinges
a
power.
that
kind
of
an
organization,
that
kind
of
an
enterprise
would
urge
that,
way
in
the
future,
there
should
be
a
mass
uprising.
but,
that's
too
remote,
as
i
gather
from
his
opinion.
that's
too
remote.
it
appends
the
clear
and
present
danger
of
his
prior
talk,
his
prior
use.
are
you
with
me
thus
far?
justice
felix
frankfurter
good.
therefore,
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
correct
me.
i
wish
you
would,
before
i
go
into
the
next
question.
that
isn't
all
there
is.
perhaps,
i
better
state
the
whole
thing
and
then
you
could
answer.
he
is
objecting
to
the
“far
in
the
future”
if
this
is
too
remote
to
shut
off
even
the
promotion
of
eventual
proletarian
mass
uprising.
now,
i
think
that's
a
good
statement
of
which
to
give
the
dennis
decision,
both
below
and
here,
because
the
dennis
decision
did
not
take
that
view.
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
in
the
future
didn't
prevent
eminence
of
danger.
this
isn't
the
time
to
discuss
the
rightness
or
wrongness.
i
am
talking
about
accepting
that
decision.
it
seems
to
me
to
collide
directly
in
what
brandeis
said
in
his
concurring
opinion.
but,
when
you
come
to
the
next
point,
he
didn't
discuss
how
much
of
an
activity
a
member
must
had
in
such
an
illegal
organization
because
he
goes
on
to
say
and,
hence,
his
concurrence,
hence,
his
agreement
in
the
judgment
in
that
case
that
because
that
organization
promoted
present
violence,
ms.
whitney's
membership
in
it
was
a
basis
for
finding
her
guilty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
i
can
understand
the
reexamination
being
requested
or
a
challenge
to
dennis
on
the
basis
of
what
brandeis'
concurrence
if
you
are
far
in
the
future.
but,
so
far
as
our
problem
as
to
membership
is
concerned,
apparently,
if
you
got
an
organization
which
promotes
violence
or
something
that's
outlawed,
then
mere
membership
brings
the
party
subject
to
guilt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
he
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
read
it
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
“i
am
unable
to
ascend
to
the
suggestion
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
assembling
with
a
political
party
formed
to
advocate
the
desirability
of
a
proletarian
revolution
for
a
mass
action
that's
someday,
necessarily
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
far
in
the
future
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
not
a
right
against
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
meant
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
admit
that
he
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
dennis
case
said
that
doesn't
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i'll
--
i'll
read
the
next
sentence.
“in
the
present
case,
however,
there
was
other
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
tended
to
establish
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
international
workers
of
the
world
to
commit
present
serious
crimes
and,
likewise,
to
show
that
such
a
conspiracy
would
be
furthered
by
the
activity
of
the
society,
not
of
ms.
whitney
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
the
activity
of
the
society
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
which
ms.
whitney
was
a
member.”
and,
i
am
saying
that
the
policy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
that
the
argument
of
the
government
which
has
to
be
met
here
that
this
defendant
who
was
a
member
of
an
organization,
the
activity
of
the
society,
the
activity
of
the
society
was
outlawed,
i'm
not
leaning
to
the
view
by
putting
the
question
necessarily.
i'm
saying
that
he
was
concerned
with
if
the
society,
as
i
read
english,
and
nothing
in
the
preceding
figures
qualifies
this,
if
the
society
was
a
society
that
furthers
illegal
present
crime
then
the
fact
that
she's
a
member,
and
all
the
members
of
such
a
society,
is
sufficient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
whole
--
my
whole
question
addressed
itself
to
this
point,
but
there's
one
question
as
to
the
purposes
and
the
activities
of
an
organization.
that
has
to
be
answered
in
the
first
place.
if
that
is
so
remote
from
his
point
of
view
then
it
isn't
a
mere
danger,
then,
the
mere
danger
doctrine
makes
it
too
remote.
and,
the
second
question
is
the
relation
of
a
person
in
association.
you
read
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
officership
has
turned
by
something,
what
was
your
phrase,
the
usual
components?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
a
membership
doesn't
imply
from
the
usual
sense
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
might
do
it
through
their
lawyers.

they

justice

it
would
be
(voice

--
justice

--
the
--
the
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
put
in
the
abundance
--
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
this,
the
course
of
my
suggestion
is
the
theory
which
congress
began
hopefully
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act,
i
think
in
this
act,
it
shall
be
construed
to
authorize,
require,
etcetera,
or
in
any
way
(inaudible).
i
get
from
that,
i
infer
from
that,
that
congress
showed
us
solicitude
about
this
whole
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
--
that
is
in
the
older
purpose
because
the
second
half
of
4
(f)
has
nothing
to
do
with
bolstering
if
you
are
relieving
from
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
to
me
it's
clear
that
whoever
does,
they
still
know
the
history
of
that
whole
part
of
legislation
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
do
you
mean
they
didn't
know
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
to
agree
that
the
second
sentence
give
the
bar
that
is
no
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
arguing
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
arguing
your
point.
i'm
arguing
--
i'm
suggesting
--
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
kind
of
awareness
or
knowledge
or
attention
to
congress
and
the
second
sentence
i
think
one
can
--
one
of
the
few
things
about
which
one
can
be
automatic
in
this
area
to
say
the
second
sentence
is
no
bar
for
what
was
intended
to
the
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
that's
why.
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
you
nor
i
are
attacking
great
credit
of
understanding
to
whatever
interpretation
was
given
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
synonymies
state
of
mind
and
association?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
association
also
subjective?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
merely
a
state
of
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
merely
a
state
of

justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
merely
subjective.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
old,
the
old,
the
funny
old
case
of
the
irony,
in
association
with
(inaudible)
going
to
an
association
of
conduct
that
either
state
of
mind
is
normally
subjective,
don't
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
depends
on
what
you
associate
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
make
law
a
principle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you
begin
with
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
on
one
construction
of
4
(f),
the
government
introduced
any
--
i'll
use
a
fraction
that
you
said,
any
active
membership
in
order
to
establish
association
amounting
to
conspiracy
in
4
(a).
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
most
of
the
time
established
for
association,
that's
why
you
establish
a
conspiracy.
all
to
action
which
is
more
dubious
from
which
we
incur
that
they
are
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
never
establish
conspiracy
without
establishing
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
legislative
annotations
to
section
17,
to
section
17?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
care
whether
this
was
a
reference
to
this
particular
case,
is
there
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
--
that's
a
saving
clause,
is
there
anything
said
about
saving?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

by
mr.
taylor.
justice
felix

it's
in
mr.
taylor's
brief
on
page

--
the
appendix

justice

well,
do
you
have
those

you
want?
justice

one
side
of
this

justice
felix

but
i
have
--
i
had
blissfully
hoped
that's
the
only
one
for
you.
[laughter]
it
brings
the
whole
act.
anyhow,
it
brings
section
17.
it's
at
a40.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a40.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
apologies
to
everybody.
it's
in
the
brief
of
counsel
for
petitioners
of
communist
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
throw
you
the
credit
of
blame,
general
taylor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
and
they
might
also
inadvertently
repeal
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
conscious
speaking
is
proved
rather
than
to
content?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
--
if
you
have
to
make
out
of
things
that
a
man
is
a
member,
is
that
a
burden
of
proving
membership
given
it's
the
understanding
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
you
say
that
you
have
an
--
spent
a
wonderful
life
out
here
on
social
literature
that
all
the
--
got
the
first
petition
of
the
communist
manifestos,
there
are
all
the
words
in
(inaudible)
student
of
that?
and
suppose
you
register
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
will
suppose
you
say
more.
suppose
you
have
a
--
a
heartfelt
letter
in
which
he
asked
to
become
an
enrolled
member,
because
he
deeply
believed
the
cause
and
wants
to
add
his
strength,
the
party's
member
strength
to
the
cause,
is
that
(inaudible)
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
says,
"all
i
need
was
--
whenever
you
need
my
help"
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
reserve
officer,
a
reserve
member,
is
that
activity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
paid
dues?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
just
a
state
of
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
that
that
activity
is
a
very
ambiguous
and
dubious
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you're
shifting
now
to
--
intent
is
one
thing,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
intent
conveys
one
thought
to
me,
activity
conveyed
some
other
thought
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
merely
rejecting
this
talismanic
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
you
case,
it
would
be
an
easier
case
for
you
to
discuss
about
the
decision
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
--
activity
means
something
outside
of
the
mind
from
doing
--
from
doing
something,
external
to
yourself.
that's
what
activity
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
we
found
that
it
wasn't
within
the
deportation
act,
because
there
wasn't
that
use
of
the
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
activity
so-called
might
be
ambiguous,
as
you
see.
that
brings
you
to
intent.
on
the
other
hand,
(inaudible)
outside
your
mind
by
doing
something,
not
just
a
union
with
your
own
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
do
something
more
mr.
david.
you
can't
say
that
in
this
case
to
prove,
to
approve
(inaudible)
one
of
the
governing
statutes
as
a
party
within
its
reach.
court
has
to
put
in
words,
some
standard
(inaudible),
which
must
be
applied
by
the
district
judges
in
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
say
we'll
wait
until
every
case
comes
up
here
and
(inaudible)
is
clearly
up
to
his
--
up
to
his
head,
the
party
work
or
any
comes
within
it,
and
so
we
wait
case
by
case
not
in
determining
some
formulated
criterion
to
the
fact
of
the
different
cases,
but
we
just
take
the
cases
at
us.
we
can't
do
that,
can
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
really
covered
it.
you
mean
to
say
a
--
a
member
in
good
standing
or
a
--
a
recognized
member
of
the
party
goes
out
and
(inaudible)
to
the
communist
picket
where
the
communist
picket
is
allowed,
isn't
he
acting
for
the
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
protest
votes.
it's
one
thing
for
a
man
to
cast
a
protest
vote,
it's
another
thing
for
a
man
who
is
a
functionary
of
the
party
to
get
him
to
cast
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
well,
may
i
ask
you
whether
--
could
be
a
party
(inaudible)
of
the
federal
government
or
to
state
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
we
--
when
we
vote,
we
vote
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
(inaudible)
--
we
vote
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
allowed
or
state
disallowed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
a
state
might
have
the
ku
klux
klan
allowing
to
--
at
a
political
party
in
the
federal
government,
and
therefore,
not
be
hopeless
in
making
federal
crimes
pursued
by
the
ku
klux
party,
although
you
could
vote
for
it
in
a
state
where
it
is
a
voting
party,
federal
government
may
outlaw
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
had
that
federal
legislation
dealing
with
acts
which
the
state
law
authorized
the
klan
to
do,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
klan
action,
for
me
the
whole
civil
rights
act
part
of
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
could
do
things
that
the
state
allows
you
to
focus
on.
you
can
speeches
for
it.
but
the
federal
government
might
say
this
is
an
inclusion
into
the
protected
area
of
federal
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
you
have
to
punish
them
(inaudible)
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
acts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
they
punish
them
for
advocating
to
support
a
party,
whatever
you
call
it,
simply
that
believes
in
the
first
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
advocating
is
an
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
the
de
jonge
case
illustrates
what
i
was
trying
to
get
from
you
namely,
that
initially
i
was
referring
to,
that
it
brings
out
what
my
problem,
namely,
what
is
the
criteria
to
be
applied
not
in
this
case
but
in
the
next
case?
now,
the
point
about
the
de
jonge
case
was
that
in
view
of
the
indictment,
in
view
of
the
speculation,
most
especially
in
view
of
the
decision
of
this
oregon
--
of
the
oregon
court,
anybody
who
participate,
anybody
who
participated
in
a
meeting
called
by
the
communist
party
would
be
within
the
trial
of
that
statute.
it
was
immaterial
that
de
jonge
himself
was
a
member.
because
the
way
the
oregon
courts
construed
that
statute,
you
and
i,
if
we
were
that
meeting,
could
be
within
the
statute
and
it
was
that
that
this
court
found
unconstitutional
because
they
would
have
had
to
affirm
or
reverse
the
decision
of
the
governing
ruling
of
the
oregon
court
(inaudible)
that
the
facts
of
de
jonge
was
a
communist
was
irrelevant.
he
wasn't
charged
with
that.
and
the
statute
didn't
make
that
a
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they're
two
different
things,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
quite
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
mind
doesn't
travel
with
the
act?
that's
very
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
thought
he
also
means
that
he
must
really,
given
that
theory,
through
the
way
in
which
you
and
i
have
submit
ourselves
to
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
affiliate,
maybe
--
maybe
not
less
or
more
but
different,
it
might
be
covered
so-called
front
organization?
