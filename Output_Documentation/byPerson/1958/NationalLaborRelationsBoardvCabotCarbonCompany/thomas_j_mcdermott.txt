mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
upon
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit.
this
case
involves
a
determination
by
the
labor
board
that
certain
employee
representation
committees
are
labor
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(5),
the
taft-hartley
act
and
that
the
respondents,
referred
to
herein
as
cabot,
dominated,
interfered
with,
assisted
and
supported
those
committees
in
violation
of
section
82
of
the
act.
the
court
below
while
accepting
the
board's
finding
that
cabot
in
fact
dominated,
interfered
with,
assisted
and
supported
the
committees
in
question,
disagreed
with
the
board
that
the
committees
are
labor
organizations
and
therefore,
the
court
found
that
no
violation
of
section
82
had
occurred.
hence,
the
basic
and
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
committees
are
labor
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
essential
facts
of
the
case
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows.
during
world
war
ii,
an
employee
representation
committee
was
established
at
each
of
cabot's
plants
or
installations
in
line
with
the
work
production
board's
encouragement
of
joint
labor
management
committees
to
promote
production
and
efficiency.
the
employee
representation
system
was
continued
after
the
war
and
a
committee
was
set
up
for
each
new
plant
acquired
by
cabot.
the
committees
have
no
formal
organization.
there
are
no
membership
requirements,
no
dues
and
no
officers.
organization
is
limited
to
the
election
once
a
year
by
the
employees,
committeemen
and
their
alternates.
the
committees'
bylaws
provide
that
the
purposes
of
the
committee
are
to
bring
about
a
better
understanding
between
management
and
the
employee
and
to
provide
a
definite
procedure
for
considering
employees
ideas
with
respect
to
problems
of
mutual
interest,
such
as
safety,
increased
efficiency
in
production
and
the
improvement
or
the
encouragement
of
ingenuity
and
initiative.
the
bylaws
further
provide
the
committees
shall
meet
at
regular
monthly
and
special
meetings
called
by
the
management,
make
recommendations
on
employee
suggestions,
submitted
under
cabot
suggestion
plant
and
handle
grievances
in
nonunion
plants
or
departments.
the
committees
in
addition
to
handling
grievances
in
discussing
with
management,
problems
concerning
plant
production
efficiency,
have
dealt
with
a
wide
variety
of
other
matters.
thus,
doing
a
period
covered
by
the
complaint,
the
employee
committees
have
complained
about,
discussed,
made
request
and
recommendations,
and
otherwise,
dealt
with
cabot
with
respect
to
seniority
in
the
transfer
of
employee,
job
classifications,
job
bidding,
improvement
of
working
facility,
overtime
records
and
time
cards,
the
merit
system,
layoff
and
makeup
time,
working
schedules,
vacation
and
sick
leave,
the
allocation
of
company
houses,
holidays,
and
other
matters
affecting
their
employment.
and
while
management
did
not
accede
to
our
request,
it
did
frequently
act
upon
request
or
complaints
made
by
this
committee.
first
among
other
things,
management
agreed
to
change
from
a
company
to
a
plant
seniority
system
in
certain
plants
to
put
up
vents
in
tops
of
warehouses,
to
furnish
workloads
at
cost,
to
permit
employees
to
report
early
and
leave
early
on
weekends,
and
to
establish
an
annual
basis
for
allocating
overtime.
although
there's
no
provision
in
the
bylaws
for
central
committee,
central
committee
exist
the
part
of
the
employee
representation
plant
is
composed
of
the
chairmen
of
each
plant
committee
and
meets
annually
with
top
management.
the
central
committee
at
its
1955
and
1956
annual
meetings
with
cabot's
director
of
industrial
relations,
mr.
reno
stinson,
made
proposals
and
had
discussions
with
respect
to
matters
similar
to
those
handled
by
the
plant
committee.
these
subjects
included
among
other
items,
a
three-week
vacation
for
employees
with
10
year's
service,
annual
sick
leave
and
sick
or
disability
benefits,
whether
shiftmen
should
be
permitted
to
make
up
days
lost
in
work,
a
request
for
the
creation
of
new
job
classifications,
a
proposal
for
greater
uniformity
among
the
different
plants
and
maintaining
job
classifications,
more
opportunities
for
employees
to
shift
from
plant
to
plant,
from
department
to
department,
and
finally,
proposals
for
a
general
wage
increase.
with
respect
to
each
of
the
proposals
or
requests
made
by
--
at
these
meetings,
director
stinson
set
forth
cabot's
position
or
policy,
discussed
whether
or
not
acceding
to
the
proposals
or
to
requests
would
be
economically
feasible
in
the
point
of
view
of
cabot
and
sought
to
reach
some
solution.
in
some
instances,
stinson
expressed
approval
of
the
request
or
he
promised
to
do
--
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
remedy
in
a
situation
complained
of.
in
other
instances,
stinson
told
the
committeemen
to
take
it
up
with
local
management.
in
still
other
instances,
stinson
expressed
disapproval
of
the
request
and
gave
his
reasons
for
doing
so.
on
the
basis
of
these
and
other
facts
in
the
record,
the
board
determined
that
the
committees
in
question
are
labor
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(5)
of
the
act.
that
section
reads
as
follows
and
i
quote.
“the
term
'labor
organization'
means
any
organization
of
any
kind,
or
any
agency
or
employee
representation
committee
or
plant,
in
which
employees
participate
and
which
exists
for
the
purpose,
in
whole
or
in
part,
of
dealing
with
employers
concerning
grievances,
labor
disputes,
wages,
rates
of
pay,
hours
of
employment,
or
conditions
of
work.”
when
the
activities
of
the
committees,
as
i
have
described
them,
are
put
down
beside,
playing
an
explicit
wording
of
section
2
(5),
the
conclusion
seems
quite
clear
that
the
committee
exactly
the
statutory
definition.
thus,
employees
participate
in
these
committees
through
their
elective
representatives
and
the
committee
that
exists
at
least
in
part
for
their
purpose
of
dealing
with
cabot
and
employer
concerning
grievances
and
working
conditions.
why
then
did
the
court
below
find
the
committees
not
to
be
labor
organizations?
the
answer
lies
in
the
court's
erroneous
belief
that
the
term
dealing
as
used
in
section
2
(5)
is
coextensive
with
bargaining
or
negotiating
as
those
terms
are
commonly
understood.
otherwise
stated,
the
court
held
that
a
group
of
employees
is
not
a
labor
organization
unless
it
exists
for
the
purpose
of
bargaining
or
negotiating
with
employer.
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
committees
in
this
case
exist
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
rather
than
bargaining
with
cabot.
and
therefore,
the
court
concluded
that
they
are
not
labor
organization.
in
some,
the
court
below
would
limit
the
term
“labor
organization”
as
defined
in
section
2
(5)
to
organizations
which
bargained
collectively.
but
such
was
not
the
intention
of
the
congress
which
originally
wrote
the
definition
of
labor
organization.
section
2
(5),
the
present
act,
was
carried
over
without
change
from
the
original
or
the
wagner
act.
the
legislative
history
of
the
wagner
act
is
more
fully
detailed
in
our
brief.
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
the
term
“labor
organization”
to
be
given
the
widest
connotation
and
to
reach
specifically
the
very
type
of
labor
organization
involved
in
this
case.
but
senator
wagner's
first
bill
introduced
in
1934
did
not
include
by
name,
employee
representation
committee,
and
his
definition
of
labor
organization.
during
the
hearings
on
the
bill,
edwin
e.
witte,
professor
of
economics
at
the
university
of
wisconsin,
questioned
whether
the
definition
as
been
written
“covers
a
situation
that
is
most
prevalent
in
this
whole
field
of
company
unionism.
that
loose
organization,
if
you
can
call
it
an
organization,
but
has
no
members,
no
dues,
that
is
merely
a
method
of
electing
representatives
known
as
the
employee
representation
committee,
which
is
the
most
prevalent
form
of
company
union.”
at
senator
wagner's
prompting,
professor
witte
proposed
that
the
definition
be
revised
to
include
by
name
the
employee
representation
committee.
this
was
done
in
the
final
version
of
the
1934
bill.
the
following
year,
senator
wagner
introduced
this
second
bill
which
had
amended
became
the
wagner
act.
it
defined
“labor
organization”
as
“any
organization
of
any
kind
or
any
agency
or
employee
representation
committee
or
plant
in
which
employees
participate
and
which
exists
for
the
purpose
in
whole
or
in
part
of
dealing
with
employers
concerning
grievances,
labor
disputes,
wages,
rates
of
pay,
or
hours
of
employment.”
ms.
frances
perkins,
the
then
secretary
of
labor,
proposed
that
the
latter
definition
be
amended
by
substituting
for
the
word
“dealing”
the
words
“bargaining
collectively”
and
by
adding
to
the
end
of
the
definition,
the
words
or
conditions
of
work.
but
congress,
although
it
added
the
words
or
conditions
of
work
to
the
end
of
the
definition,
refused
to
change
“dealing”
to
“bargaining
collectively.”
the
proposed
definition
as
amended
became
section
2
(5)
of
the
wagner
act,
that
congress
do
not
intend
to
limit
the
term
“labor
organization”
to
organizations
which
“bargaining
collectively”
as
distinguished
for
merely
“dealing.”
it's
further
demonstrated
by
the
memoranda
which
prepared
at
the
time
for
the
use
of
the
senate
labor
committee
in
which
are
detailed
in
our
brief.
in
one
of
these
memoranda,
the
senate
committee
was
advised
as
follows
and
i
quote.
“it
has
been
argued
that
an
employee
representation
plan
or
committee
arrangement
is
not
the
labor
organization
or
a
union
but
simply
a
method
of
contact
between
employers
and
employees.
but
the
act
is
entitled
to
prescribe
its
own
definitions
of
labor
organizations,
for
its
own
purposes.
and
it
is
clear
that
unless
these
plans
are
included
in
the
definition,
whether
they
merely
'deal'
or
'adjust,'
or
exist
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining,
most
of
the
activity
of
employers
in
connection
therewith
which
we
are
seeking
to
outlaw
would
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
act.
the
act
would
thus
be
entirely
nullified.”
it
is
evident
from
the
forgoing
i
submit
that
the
congress
which
originally
defined
the
term
“labor
organization”
would
not
agree
with
the
lower
court's
narrow
interpretation
of
it.
the
same
is
to
be
said
of
the
congress
which
in
1947
reenacted
without
change
the
broad
definition
of
labor
organization
contained
in
section
2
(5)
of
the
wagner
act.
in
doing
so,
congress
specifically
disclaimed
any
intention
to
change
the
definition
of
labor
organization.
nonetheless,
the
court
below
held
the
exact
opposite
on
the
basis
of
a
somewhat
unusual
approach
to
legislative
history
to
its
claim.
the
hartley
or
house
bill
contained
a
provision
which
would
have
permitted
an
employer
to
establish
or
maintain
a
committee
of
employee
and
discuss
what
matters
of
mutual
interest,
including
grievances
and
working
conditions,
provided
that
the
employees
could
not
have
a
bargaining
representative.
if
this
proposal
had
been
adopted
by
congress,
the
effect
would
have
been
to
exempt
such
committees
from
the
reach
of
the
statutory
prohibition
against
employer
domination
or
support
of
labor
organizations.
but
congress
rejected
the
proposal.
in
doing
so,
the
conference
committee
stated
and
i
quote.
“this
provision
is
omitted
from
the
conference
agreement
since
the
act
by
its
terms
permits
individual
employees
and
groups
of
employees
to
meet
with
the
employer
and
section
9
(a)
of
the
conference
agreement
permits
employers
to
answer
their
grievances.”
the
court
below
read
the
statement
coupled
with
section
9
(a)
of
the
act
as
amended
to
mean
that
congress
adopted
rather
than
rejected
as
it
did
to
propose
any
question.
this
reading
of
the
statute
and
legislative
history
is
untenable.
the
conference
committee
simply
state
--
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
need
for
such
a
proposal
because
the
statute
otherwise
adequately
safeguard
the
right
of
the
individual
employee
and
of
groups
of
employees
to
meet
with
their
employer
and
discuss
matters
of
mutual
interest.
section
9
(a)
is
the
majority
rule
provision
of
the
act.
its
basic
clause
provides
that
the
representatives
designated
by
a
majority
of
employee
in
a
corporate
unit
“shall
be
the
exclusive
representatives
in
respect
to
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment,
or
other
conditions
of
employment.”
this
clause
was
qualified
in
the
wagner
act
by
a
proviso
which
stated,
“provided
that
any
individual
employee
or
a
group
of
employee
shall
have
the
right
at
any
time
to
present
grievances
to
their
employer.”
the
taft-hartley
act
added
the
following
to
both
proviso.
“and
to
have
such
grievances
adjusted,
without
the
intervention
of
the
bargaining
representative,
as
long
as
the
adjustment
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
or
agreement
being
in
effect
then
in
effect
provided
further
that
the
bargain
representative
has
been
given
opportunity
to
be
present
at
such
adjustment.”
the
provisos
thus
deal
with
the
right
of
individual
employee
and
groups
of
employee
where
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
has
been
selected.
and
they
give
assurance
that
any
individual
employee
or
groups
of
employees
continues
to
have
the
right
to
present
grievances
to
their
employer
and
to
have
them
adjusted
independently
of
the
bargaining
representative,
subject
to
the
latter's
right
to
be
present
at
the
adjustment
in
order
to
protect
the
bargaining
contract
or
the
interest
of
the
entire
unit.
the
provisos
do
not
deal
with
the
question
whether
employee
representation
committees
are
labor
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
and
there
is
no
basis
certainly
for
inspiring
that
the
provisos
intended
to
permit
employers
to
dominate
or
to
support
employee
committees.
indeed
as
previously
noted,
congress
made
clear
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
remove
from
the
definition
of
labor
organization,
employee
representation
committees
to
the
type
involved
here.
and
thereby
to
sanction,
there's
domination
and
support
by
employers.
in
view
of
the
positive
disclaimer
of
any
legislative
intent
to
change
the
definition
of
labor
organization,
there
is
certainly
no
warrant
for
presuming
as
the
court
did
below
that
congress
effected
such
a
change
by
indirections.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
committees
such
as
this
could
exist
to
discuss
--
they
could
--
they
could
exist
to
discuss
grievances
in
working
conditions.
the
issue
here
is
that
they
cannot
be
dominated
or
supported
or
assisted
by
the
employer.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
that's
right,
absent
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
that's
right,
in
an
absence
--
the
presence
of
a
majority
representative.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
definitely.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
well,
no.
the
issue
--
the
court
below
said,
with
--
with
the
board
that
these
committees
were
dominated
and
supported,
etcetera.
but
they
had
said
there's
no
violation
of
section
82
because
these
committees
are
not
labor
organizations.
but
you
can't
determine
whether
they're
labor
organizations
unless
you
know
what
they
--
how
they
were
composed
and
what
they
did.
now,
they
doubt
with
cabot
as
an
employer
concerning
grievances
and
working
conditions.
for
example,
they
pointed
out,
they
doubt
with
cabot
concerning
--
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
provided
they
were
not
dominated.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
well,
the
--
if
i
may
point
out
first,
that
question
is
along
here
before
for
this
court
because
the
court
below
agreed
with
the
board
except
to
the
board's
findings
that
these
committees
were
dominated
and
the
respondents
do
not
contend
otherwise.
the
domination
exists
in
this
case.
first,
the
bylaws
were
set
up
with
the
approval
of
management.
they
could
not
be
changed
without
approval
of
management.
if
a
particular
plant
or
department
failed
to
select
a
committeeman,
the
superintendent
selected
the
committeeman.
the
committees
could
not
be
increased
in
number
without
the
permission
of
management.
the
meetings
were
called
by
management.
the
arrangement
of
the
entire
employee
representation
system
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
management's
guide
to
new
employees.
and
as
you
will
see
from
study
in
the
record,
the
relationship
that's
set
forth
between
in
employees'
representation
committees
and
management
would
indicate
that
there
was
domination.
but
to
repeat,
the
court
below
except
to
the
board's
findings
that
these
committees
were
dominated,
supported
and
assisted
and
the
respondents
do
not
challenge
those
findings
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
and
held
they
were
not
labor
organizations,
basically
because
the
court
said
the
word
to
“deal”
must
mean
to
“bargain”
or
“negotiate”
and
it
--
unless
these
organizations
bargain
collectively
and
i
might
say
the
court
had
in
mind
the
--
the
traditional
sense
to
negotiate
a
contract,
formal
or
informal,
to
sit
across
the
table
and
--
otherwise
the
union
would
do
--
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
these
committees
are
labor
organizations
under
the
act.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
well,
it's
narrowed
to
the
question
of
whether
the
word
“deal”
as
used
in
section
2
(5)
is
coextensive
with
“to
bargain”
or
“to
negotiate.”
it
is
our
position
that
the
word
“deal”
cannot
be
--
must
not
--
does
not
have
to
be
equated
necessarily
to
“bargain,
negotiate.”
in
other
words,
the
word
“deal”
has
a
broader
connotation
in
“to
bargain”
or
“to
negotiate.”
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
yes,
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
they
argued
that
they're
not
labor
organizations
because
they
never
negotiated
a
contract
or
attempted
to
--
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
--
nor
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
they
proved
it
not
to
be
a
labor
organization
by
the
result
of
the
domination.
respondents
contend
in
their
brief
to
this
court
that
to
vote
a
committee
to
this
type,
our
labor
organizations
would
bar
employers
and
employees
in
getting
together
and
discussing
matters
of
mutual
interest.
the
short
answer
to
this
contention
is
that
the
board's
finding
would
not
establish
such
a
bar.
the
board's
finding
and
ruling
merely
precludes
the
employer
from
dominating,
supporting,
assisting
or
interfering
with
the
committee.
in
conclusion,
i
wish
to
find
out.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
in
--
in
--
they're
a
total
of
some
18
plants.
in
seven
of
the
plants,
there
is
a
bargaining
agent.
in
certain
to
those
plants,
the
two
units
coexist
and
one
of
the
plants
of
the
six,
that's
no
longer
true.
and
in
that
regard,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
several
of
the
plants
where
you
have
both
a
certified
union
and
the
employer
representation
committee,
you
had
the
committee
handling
grievances
for
outside
the
bargaining
unit
and
also,
they
have
dealt
with
the
company
on
minor
matters
involving
working
conditions,
for
example,
water
cooling.
and
there
has
been
conflict.
conflict
has
resulted
in
certain
other
plants
where
the
two
committees
existed.
in
conclusion,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
since
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley,
the
courts
of
appeals
to
the
first,
the
second,
the
sixth,
and
the
seventh
had
held
that
employee
representation
committees,
the
type
involved
here,
are
labor
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(5)
of
the
act,
and
that
their
domination
and
support
by
employers
violates
section
8
(a)
(2).
in
conclusion,
i
wish
to
respectfully
urge
this
court
do
likewise.
mr.
thomas
j.
mcdermott
only
one
point,
your
honor,
you
asked
the
question
of
what
--
asked
the
question
whether
in
reenacting
section
2
(5)
of
the
wagner
act,
did
congress
change
the
definition
of
labor
organization?
the
answer
is
that
congress
did
not
change
the
definition
and
indeed,
the
house
conference
reports
stated
expressly
that
it
was
not
being
changed.
