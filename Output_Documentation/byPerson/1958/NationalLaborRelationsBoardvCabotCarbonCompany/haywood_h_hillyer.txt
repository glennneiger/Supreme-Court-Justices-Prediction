mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
disagree
with
counsel's
statement
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
the
court
below
made
no
boons
about
what
it
was
deciding.
if
your
honors
will
refer
to
page
107
of
volume
1
of
the
record,
you
will
find
the
statement
by
the
lower
court.
we
--
we
rest
our
holding
squarely
on
the
meaning
of
the
act
as
evidenced
in
its
legislative
history.
the
act
permits
and
congress
intended
that
it
should
permit
the
existence
of
employee
management
committees
which
provide
a
forum
for
discussion
of
matters
of
mutual
interest,
but
which
are
not
formal
organizations
do
not
follow
collective
bargaining
procedures,
formally
or
informally,
have
no
powers
to
bargain
collectively
and
take
no
action
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
an
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
the
court
please,
it
is
our
position
that
the
question
before,
your
honors,
is
simply
this,
whether
the
act
as
presently
written,
forbids
an
employer
to
set
up
a
committee
of
his
employees
to
discuss
with
him
problems
of
mutual
interest
when
that
committee
is
not
set
up
to
engage
in,
does
not
purport
to
engage
in,
and
in
fact,
does
not
engage
in
any
collective
bargaining
activity.
now,
the
statement
of
facts
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
there
was
no
negotiation
on
that,
your
honor,
and
the
record
so
reflects.
what
happened
in
that
instance
was
that
the
committee
brought
to
the
attention
of
local
plant
management
that
some
of
the
employees
were
dissatisfied
because
they
had
company
seniority
rather
than
plant
seniority.
the
record
will
reflect
that
plant
management
decided
that
if
there
was
any
dissatisfaction
that
they
would
like
to
find
that
out
themselves.
they
therefore
held
a
plebiscite
amongst
all
of
the
employees,
management
did
that.
all
of
the
employees
in
that
plebiscite
voted
to
change
from
company
seniority
to
plant
seniority.
management
granted
their
request.
there
was
no
negotiation
about
it
whatsoever,
no
bargaining,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
your
honor,
there
was
no
understanding
between
the
committee
and
management.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
they
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
they
have
worked
out.
matters
were
discussed,
problems
were
worked
on,
but
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
a
bargaining
agreement.
now,
i
call
to
your
honors'
attention
that
the
trial
examined,
the
labor
board,
the
court
below,
and
inferentially,
petitioner's
own
brief,
and
the
question
presented
discloses
if
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
or
attempted
collective
bargaining.
there
was
no
negotiation.
it
was
merely
a
question
of
employees
presenting
their
ideas
to
management
and
management,
whether
or
not
they
chose
to
accede
to
the
ideas,
to
adjust
any
grievances,
it
was
all
up
to
management.
anything
that
flowed
from
those
conferences
as
the
trial
examiner
found
was
a
result
either
of
the
company's
own
magnanimity
or
the
company
policy,
and
i
think
that
is
almost
an
exact
quotation
of
his
findings.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
subscribe
to
counsel's
argument
as
to
the
clarity
of
the
purpose
of
the
wagner
act.
i
may
say
that
the
--
we
have
not
urged
our
interpretation
of
the
wagner
act
because
we
felt
that
the
purpose
of
the
1947
amendments
was
so
clear.
but,
if
your
honor
will
refer
to
the
hearing
--
the
1934
hearings
on
senate
bill
29,
26,
which
is
contained
in
the
first
volume
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1935
act
at
pages
39
and
40,
you
will
find
that
senator
wagner,
the
proponent
of
the
act
stated,
"it
is
equally
important
to
note
that
the
bill
does
not
prevent
employers
from
setting
up
societies
or
organizations
to
deal
with
problems
of
group
welfare,
health,
charity,
recreation,
insurance
or
benefits.
all
of
these
functions
can
and
should
be
fulfilled
by
employer-employee
organizations."
and
this
is
the
important
quote,
your
honor."
but
employers
should
not
dominate
organizations
which
exist
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
in
regard
to
wages,
hours,
and
other
conditions
of
employment."
so,
senator
wagner
was
there
putting
the
same
emphasis
that
we
put
here.
these
organizations
do
not
exist
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
therefore,
they
are
not
prohibited
and
i
dare
say
they
were
not
intended
to
be
prohibited
under
the
wagner
act.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
not
within
that
language,
no
your
honor.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
but
the
important
part
is
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
the
relevancy
is
that
senator
wagner
is
placing
the
importance
on
the
fact
that
only
those
organizations
are
forbidden
which
exist
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
in
regard
to
wages,
hours
and
other
conditions
of
employment.
that
is
the
importance
there.
now,
when
--
in
the
1935
hearings,
two
legislative
history
of
the
1935
act,
page
23,
33.
senator
wagner
again
makes
virtually
the
--
the
same
statement.
it
concludes,
the
bill
intends
merely
that
those
agencies
designed
to
represent
the
workers
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
shall
be
free
from
the
domination
or
even
the
interference
of
the
other
party.
now,
if
the
court
please,
there's
no
question
that
the
jurisprudence
under
the
wagner
act
is
adverse
to
opposition.
in
fact,
i
know
of
no
case
here
that
were
decided
that
i
can
claim
to
be
in
our
favor
fully.
it
was
because
of
this
jurisprudence
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
--
under
the
wagner
act
that
congress
was
dissatisfied
and
that
they
undertook
in
the
1947
amendments
to
do
that
which
we
say
they
did
and
that
was
to
legalize
these
precise
committees.
now
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
well,
i
don't
think
i
need
to
cite,
your
honor,
authority
that
you
have
to
read
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
you
have
to
read
the
legislative
history
as
a
whole.
the
definition
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
section
--
section
2
(5)
was
repeated
ipsissima
verba.
there
wasn't
any
question
about
that.
but
there
also
is
no
question,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
prohibition
of
section
8
(a)
(2)
no
longer
extends
to
these
committees
under
the
clear
congressional
intent.
now,
i
may
say
that
perhaps
it
becomes
disjointed
in
the
argument
and
have
gotten
away
from
the
fact,
there
are
few
facts
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
your
honors.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
i
do
not
construe
the
legislative
history
saying
one
thing
or
the
other,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
there
is
nothing
at
that
section
alone
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
--
is
to
be
changed.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
but,
the
meaning
of
that
section
in
the
light
of
8
(a)
(2)
which
is
the
prohibition
section
has
been
clearly
changed,
if
the
court
please,
without
changing
the
words
of
section
2
(a).
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
here
firstly
that
this
is
an
unusual
factual
situation.
these
committees
here
were
not
established
at
a
suspicious
time.
they
were
not
even
established
at
the
employer's
own
motion.
they
were
established
at
the
request
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
not
only
did
the
government
of
the
united
states
suggest
that
they
establish
the
committees,
the
government
also
provided
them
with
forms
of
bylaws
and
after
the
committee's
adopted
and
edited
those
bylaws,
the
government
approved
them
on
official
agency
of
the
government,
the
war
production
board.
clearly,
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
government
to
set
up
something
that
would
deprive
the
employees
of
their
right
to
self-organization,
known
whether
it
was
respondent's
contention
--
intention.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
record
is
complete
with
proof
that
this
respondent
has
never
sought
to
prevent
its
employees
from
bargaining
collectively
from
relying
to
the
union
if
it
wished
to,
if
they
wished
to.
the
best
evidence
i
would
say
if
that
is
the
fact
that
we
have
had
employee
committees
and
these
unions
existing
side-by-side
in
the
same
plant
for
years.
and
despite
what
counsel
has
said,
there
is
not
one
set
of
order
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
case,
if
your
honor
please,
there
had
ever
been
any
conflict
between
the
committees
and
the
regular
established
bargaining
representatives
of
the
union
committees.
so
much
so
what
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
the
union
filed
this
charge,
your
honor,
at
--
at
the
canal
plant
in
louisiana,
a
comparatively
new
plant.
and
at
a
later
date,
that
union
became
a
certified
bargaining
agent
and
we
enjoy
good
relations
with
them
today.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
no,
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
i
beg
your
pardon?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
their
activities
have
contracted
somewhat.
during
the
war
times,
they
--
they
engaged
and
shared
the
ride
and
other
particular
war
time
matters.
another
--
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
that
at
this
point,
it
is
appropriate
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
act
and
in
that
connection,
i
think
that
the
court
must
remember
the
mood
of
congress
in
which
these
amendments
were
adopted.
the
court
will
remember
that
after
world
war
ii,
there
had
been
a
rush
of
strikes.
public
resentment
against
the
public
inconvenience
had
caused
a
great
deal
of
pressure
to
have
congress
change
the
wagner
act
so
as
to
make
it
as
has
been
stated
in
the
debate,
a
two-sided
act
and
not
a
one-sided
act.
i
do
not
argue
that
point
except
the
state
that
that
was
the
pressure,
and
that
was
what
congress
set
out
to
do.
now,
it
was
perfectly
obvious
and
your
honors
probably
know
that,
but
the
legislative
history
reflects
it
anyhow,
that
there
would
be
a
presidential
veto
if
any
act
such
has
been
proposed
would
be
passed.
in
the
house,
the
pressure
was
such
that
they
had
enough
of
a
majority
to
override
a
presidential
veto.
in
the
senate,
the
issue
was
in
doubt.
the
senate
therefore
was
in
favor
of,
let
us
say,
a
milder
bill.
the
house
was
in
favor
of
a
more
militant
bill.
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
what
the
intention
was
in
the
bill
which
was
originally
introduced
in
the
house
and
which
is
commonly
called
the
hartley
bill.
in
the
bill,
section
8
(d)
was
inserted
as
a
new
article
and
8
(d)
(3)
provided,
this
is
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
commencing
on
page
14,
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
section,
the
following
shall
not
constitute
of
the
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
act.
8
(a)
(1)
was
a
free
speech
amendment
which
was
later
included
in
another
provision.
8
(d)
(2)
was
the
permission
of
employees
to
confer
with
their
employers
without
loss
of
time
or
pay.
that
was
later
included
in
another
portion
of
the
act.
8
(d)
(3)
is
the
one
here
involved
and
it
reads,
“forming
or
maintaining
by
an
employer
of
a
committee
of
employees
and
discussing
with
it
matters
of
mutual
interest,
including
grievances,
wages,
hours
of
employment,
and
other
working
conditions,
if
the
board
has
not
certified
or
the
employer
has
not
recognized
a
representative
as
their
representative
under
section
9.”
that
was
explained
in
house
report
number
245,
which
is
also
found
on
page
15
of
our
brief
as
follows,
“during
world
war
ii,
many
employers
with
the
help
of
the
government
set
up
labor
management
committees
with
which
they
discussed
matters
of
mutual
interest.”
this
exception
to
section
8
(a)
(2)
permits
employers
whose
employees
have
not
designated
the
bargaining
representative
to
set
up
similar
committees
and
to
discuss
with
them
wages,
hours,
working
conditions,
and
other
subjects
of
collective
bargaining
as
well
as
other
matters
of
mutual
interest,
and
this
is
italicized.
but
an
employer
may
not
discuss
subjects
of
collective
--
may
discuss
subjects
of
collective
bargaining
only
if
the
employers
do
not
have
a
certified
representative
on
one
that
the
employer
currently
recognized
as
exclusive
representative
of
the
employees.
this
clause
does
not
permit
company
unions.
the
employer
and
the
committee
may
discuss
and
reach
decisions
but
neither
side
may
require
the
other
to
make
an
agreement
or
to
follow
a
procedure
of
collective
bargaining
set
forth
in
section
2
(11).
the
employees
generally
may
elect
members
of
the
committee
but
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(2)
forbid
the
employer
to
create
a
formal
organization
having
members
among
employees
generally
or
other
common
characteristics
of
a
labor
union.
now,
that
section
was
passed
by
the
house,
if
the
court
please.
the
senate
amended
the
bill
by
substituting
their
own
bill
which
they
had
worked
out
on
--
in
that
chamber.
the
house
refused
to
concur
in
the
senate
amendments.
the
bill
went
to
conference.
the
conference
report
was
accompanied
by
a
statement
on
the
part
of
the
managers
of
the
house,
which
if
the
court
please,
is
the
source
of
knowledge
of
legislative
intent
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
if
there
can
be
any
serious
quarrel
with
that
statement.
now,
in
the
conference
committee
report,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
when
one
reads
it
from
beginning
to
end
that
the
conferees
on
the
part
of
the
house
are
attempting
to
reassure
the
house,
that
even
though
they
may
have
given
in
to
the
senate
on
matters
of
language,
they
have
preserved
the
substantial
intent
of
the
house
bill.
not
in
all
instances
because
representative
hartley
made
it
quite
plain
that
they
had
yielded
on
three
or
four
important
matters,
no
one
of
which
is
that
which
we
are
dealing
with
here.
representative
hartley
also
made
it
quite
plain
in
the
debates
prior
to
the
final
passage
of
the
bill
as
reported
out
of
the
conference,
that
there
was
more
in
the
bill
than
met
the
eye.
it
was
necessary
to
read
the
bill,
in
other
words,
in
the
light
of
the
conference
report
and
the
statement
of
managers
on
the
part
of
the
house.
when
the
bill
is
read
in
that
fashion,
it
is
seen
that
what
the
conference
report
does
is
to
incorporate
the
benediction,
if
you
will,
of
the
former
8
(d)
(3)
in
the
hartley
bill
into
the
conference
bill
by
indirection,
it's
true,
but
nevertheless,
it
was
done
and
that
was
a
legislative
intent,
and
if
that
was
a
legislative
intent,
that
must
be
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
when
considered
in
the
light
of
8
(a)
(2)
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
because
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
i
think
if
they
can
be
well-read
into
the
word
“grievances,”
your
honor.
at
any
rate
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
at
any
rate
i
don't
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
the
general
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
ordinarily,
i
would
not
consider
a
grievance
to
cover,
let
us
say,
a
negotiation
on
a
general
wage
increase.
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
issue
of
connotation
of
the
word.
but
in
this
particular
context,
what
this
conference
report
is
telling
the
world
is
that
the
effect
of
allowing
the
employer
to
answer
these
grievances
and
to
adjust
them
has
the
same
effect
on
--
in
regard
to
employee
committees
such
as
we
have
here
as
though
section
8
(d)
(3)
had
been
enacted.
mr.

that
was
in
the
section
8
(d)
(3).
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
your
honor
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
i
may
say,
your
honor
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
that
these
committees
where
they
co-exist
with
a
bargaining
representative
discussed
any
of
the
matters
that
come
within
the
province
of
the
bargaining
representative.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
there
were
a
number
of
things
that
were
listed,
if
the
court
please,
with
regard
to
those
plants
at
which
there
were
no
union
representatives.
i
may
say
that
we
have
plants
involved
in
this
case
where
they
have
25
employers
out
in
the
wharves
of
our
second
largest
state
and
the
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
each
plant
is
a
separate
--
for
purposes
of
administration,
it's
a
separate
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
there
is
no
collective
bargaining,
your
honor,
except
in
the
union
plants.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
and
in
the
union
plants,
each
plant
is
a
separate
unit.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
and
--
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
it,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
been
the
way
that
the
courts
have
interpreted
it.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
as
part
of
the
entire
picture
of
the
legislative
intent.
mr.
haywood
h.
hillyer
and
what
i
primarily
rely
on,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
congress
has
told
the
court
that
that's
what
they're
doing.
it
would
be
difficult,
i
grant
you,
just
by
reading
those
sections
to
import
into
those
sections,
meaning
which
congress
attributed
to
them,
where
not
for
the
fact
that
you
have
a
very
clear
explanation
in
the
conference
report.
the
decision
below,
if
the
court
please,
does
not
go
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
have,
as
i
previously
stated,
a
rather
unusual
case,
there's
no
question
that
the
employer
has
used
these
committees,
had
tried
to
use
these
committees
or
that
they
ever
have
in
fact,
deterred
unionization.
the
evidence
is
all
to
the
contrary.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
--
the
argument
which
we
make
here
is
entirely
in
keeping
with
the
theory,
with
the
mood
of
the
1947
amendments.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
is
to
promote
industrial
peace.
the
best
way
of
promoting
industrial
peace
is
for
the
employer
and
the
employee
to
understand
one
another's
problems.
these
committees
serve
as
a
channel
of
communication
between
the
employer
and
the
employees
to
understand
one
another's
problems.
and
i
believe
that
frankly,
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
and
not
in
keeping
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act
to
restrict
a
channel
of
communication
that
is
not
otherwise
harmful
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
if
the
court
please,
that
these
committees
have
been
harmful
to
anything.
in
fact,
they
had
served
a
good
and
useful
purpose.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
