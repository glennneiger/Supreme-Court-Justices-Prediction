mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
.mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
contempt
of
court
convictions
made
by
a
new
york
state
supreme
court
justice,
conducting
a
judicial
inquiry
into
alleged
so
called
ambulance
chasing
in
kings
county,
brooklyn,
new
york.
the
appellants
were
sentenced
30
days
to
sit
in
prison
for
refusal
to
answer
questions.
each
appellant
served
two
days
and
they
are
both
enlarged
in
bail
pending
the
determination
of
the
appeal.
their
refusal
to
answer
these
questions
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
justice
denied
or
refused
to
allow
their
counsel
to
be
present
in
the
courtroom
while
they
were
being
questioned.
and
the
appellants
now
make
a
claim
on
this
appeal
that
the
denial
of
their
counsel's
presence
in
the
courtroom
while
they
were
being
questioned
and
the
appellants
now
make
the
claim
on
this
appeal
that
the
denial
of
their
counsel
presence
in
the
courtroom
where
they
were
being
question
was
a
denial
to
them
of
their
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
rights.
the
order
of
this
court
of
november
was
from
the
consideration
of
jurisdiction
until
the
argument
of
the
case
on
appeal.
our
position
on
that
jurisdictional
aspect
is
that
appeal
does
lie
here
as
a
matter
of
technical
right,
and
in
any
event
a
substantial
question
being
presented
that
the
court
can
make
the
decision
of
the
question
by
the
route
of
certiorari
if
for
technical
reasons,
appeal
fails.
now,
on
the
right
to
come
here
by
way
of
appeal,
the
appellants
take
the
position
that
section
90
subdivision
10
of
our
local
judiciary
law
in
the
state
of
new
york,
as
construed
and
applied
in
this
case,
denied
them
their
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
the
section
in
brief
provides
for
conduct
of
investigations
by
the
appellate
division
of
the
conduct
of
attorneys
at
law.
and
one
of
the
provisions
is
that
until
a
certain
stage
is
reached,
these
investigations
must
be
made
privately.
now
in
this
case,
the
review
of
the
commitments
on
the
local
law
has
to
be
taken
by
so
called
article
78
proceedings,
the
equivalent
of
a
common
law
certiorari
and
where
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
is
involved
as
a
party,
the
proceeding
must
be
initiated
in
the
intermediate
appellate
court
or
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
so
that
the
instant
case
started
by
original
petitions
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
for
a
review
of
these
commitments.
the
appellate
division
in
this
case,
dismissed
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
distinction
between
the
case
we
presented
and
a
prior
case
which
we
designate
as
a
companion
case,
which
had
then
recently
been
decided
by
the
appellate
division
and
needs
to
appeal
had
been
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
case,
the
essential
part
of
the
ruling
on
this
point
is
stated
on
page
10
of
our
brief
and
the
appellate
division
said
that
we
contented
that
our
case
was
different
from
anonymous
m
from
the
so
called
companion
case.
they
cite
the
anonymous
m
case
and
they
find
that
there
was
no
difference
and
therefore
our
petitions
were
dismissed.
now
the
anonymous
m
case,
the
opinion
on
that
or
the
essential
portion
on
jurisdiction
is
printed
on
page
15
of
our
brief
and
there
we
say
that
the
appellate
division
construed
the
right
of
the
justice
conducting
the
inquiry
to
exclude
counsel
to
come
out
of
this
section
90
subdivision
10.
the
excerpt
of
this
is
a
short
one,
it's
central,
and
i'll
read
it.
the
order
also
provided,
this
is
from
the
companion
case,
that
for
the
purposes
of
protecting
the
reputation
of
innocent
persons,
the
said
inquiry
and
investigation
shall
be
conducted
in
private
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
judiciary
law
section
90,
subdivision
10.
then
i
have
omitted
certain
portions
and
they
conclude,
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
additional
special
term
to
exclude
petitioner's
attorney
from
the
room
while
petitioner
was
being
questioned.
now
was
it
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights?
citing
a
local
case
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
matter
of
groban
then
recently
decided
in
this
court
in
judiciary
law
section
90,
so
that
we
say
that
our
petitions
were
dismissed
in
the
appellate
division
on
the
ground
that
this
local
statute
authorized
the
exclusion
of
counsel
in
order
to
maintain
the
statutory
privacy.
now
after
the
dismissal
of
our
petitions
in
the
intermediary
appellate
court,
we
took
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
a
right
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
higher
state
court
of
new
york
on
the
ground
that
a
constitutional
question
was
involved.
then
counsel
for
respondent
made
a
motion
in
that
court
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
no
substantial
constitutional
question
was
involved
and
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
no
substantial
constitutional
question
was
involved.
it
should
be
no
different
if
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
form
in
which
we
took
our
appeal.
it
was
the
substance
of
our
appeal
that
was
thus
adjudicated
and
we
say
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
adjudication
by
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
jurisdiction
is
an
affirmance
of
what
was
done
in
the
appellate
division.
now
with
that
as
the
premise,
this
is
the
way
we
start
out
our
right
to
appeal
as
a
technical
matter
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
will
not
review
a
construction
of
the
statute
of
the
state,
especially
in
its
constitutional
aspect
unless
the
court
--
the
higher
state
court
itself
either
had
an
opportunity
to
construe
it
in
relation
to
the
constitutional
challenge
or
in
fact
they
construe
it
in
relation
to
the
constitutional
challenge.
now
we
say
that
the
appellate
division
decision
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
did
affirm,
gave
a
full
and
complete
notice
that
what
was
done
here
was
done
under
this
local
statute,
that
it
was
challenged
on
the
ground
that
would
be
unconstitutionality
that
is
to
say
that
it
would
deny
due
process.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
ample
opportunity
to
say
what
it
wanted
to
say
in
point
of
construction
of
that
statute
so
that
we
say
as
a
technical
legal
manner
that
appeal
lies
here
because
we
have
satisfied
the
rule,
laid
down
on
the
cases
of
this
court
that
the
highest
state
court
either
did
construe
it
or
had
a
chance
to
construe
it.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
i
did
not,
not
in
the
appellate
division.
the
point
i
am
making
here
is
there
is
a
bifocal
approach.
either
the
necessity
for
the
challenge
in
the
state
court
as
i
see
it
your
honor
is
to
give
the
highest
state
court
an
opportunity
to
construe
the
statute,
but
if
even
without
anybody
raising
the
question,
the
record
as
a
whole
shows
that
the
decision
in
the
higher
state
court
was
an
affirmance
of
our
position
taken
on
the
basis
of
a
statute,
then
we
have
the
substantial
or
real
equivalent
of
a
decision
by
the
higher
state
court
that
this
statute
authorizes
exclusion
and
we
are
here
as
a
matter
of
right
by
route
of
appeal.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
only
--
not
in
respect
--
my
answer
should
be
no
sir.
only
in
respect
of
a
local
matter,
there
was
a
question
of
discretion
involved.
the
appellate
division
had
decided
two
things.
the
appellant
division
didn't
say
that
all
must,
all
counsel
must
be
excluded.
the
appellate
division
there
said
that
the
justice
at
the
inquiry
had
the
right
to
exclude
counsel
over
discretion
to
admit
him.
the
fuller
text
of
that
opinion
shows
that.
now
the
distinction
we
make
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
that
is
correct
in
respect
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
that's
right.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
we
have
--
perhaps
one
qualification
--
i
think
your
honor
is
right
on
that
as
to
our
position.
we
take
the
traditional
position
that
the
statute
as
construed
and
applied
to
our
particular
case.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
that
could
be.
on
the
other
hand
there
are
statutes
by
their
face
upon
a
mere
reading
so
far
impinge
upon
constitutional
limitation.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
no
because
that
statute
was
dragged
in
here
by
the
heels.
it
was
never
intended
to
cover
a
so
called
ambulance
chasing
investigation.
the
statute
has
a
long
history,
but
that
of
course
is
not
for
this
court.
those
were
some
of
the
collateral
matters
that
we
argued
in
the
local
court.
we
were
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
sir.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
only
in
one
way,
he
didn't
act
only
under
the
order.
he
was
authorized
by
the
order
to
act
under
the
law.
he
applied
the
law.
he
was
authorized
by
the
order
to
undo
the
statute
to
exclude
people
so
as
to
maintain
the
privacy.
the
statute
is
right
in
the
crux
of
this
problem.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
and
it
referred
to
this
section
of
the
statute.
the
statute
is
right
there.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
his
appointment
flowed
from
the
order,
but
he
applied
the
law,
he
applied
the
statute.
now
on
this
question
of
the
jurisdiction,
we,
he
didn't
detain
the
case
much
longer
because
in
any
event
i
think
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
presented
a
substantial
question
is,
subsumed
in
the
court's
decision
that
the
problem
be
postponed,
the
jurisdictional
problem
for
the
argument
of
the
case
on
the
merit.
so
even
if
for
technical
reasons
we
failed
on
this
question
of
right
of
appeal,
i
think
the
court
can
decide
the
question
by
way
of
certiorari
and
the
problem
is
really
here
without
any
serious
impediment
and
now
to
the
merits.
this
was
an
order
to
investigate
alleged
malpractice
by
attorneys
and
others
associated
with
them
in
kings
county.
the
appellants
here
are
not
attorneys.
they
are
licensed
investigators
and
they
are
just
that.
they
are
licensed
by
the
state
of
new
york.
they
have
a
defined
function
in
the
scheme
of
negligence,
litigation
and
settlement.
now
they
were
subpoenaed
to
come
before
this
investigation
of
the
judicial
inquiry.
they
came
with
counsel
and
they
repeatedly
pointed
out
to
the
judge
that
before
they
had
come
in
for
the
actual
questioning,
they
and
their
counsel
had
been
informed
by
a
member
of
inquiry
staff
that
enough
evidence
had
already
been
gathered
against
them
to
submit
to
the
district
attorney,
that
the
enquiry
doesn't
intend
to
pussyfoot
with
them
and
that
is
if
they
come
clean
so
to
speak,
that
will
be
taken
into
consideration.
the
testimony
that
was
given
by
this
member
of
the
staff
is
found
on
page
115
and
116
in
the
record.
the
way
he
came
to
give
the
testimony
was
that
these
parties
repeatedly
turned
to
the
judge
and
said,
we
are
not
here
as
witnesses,
we
are
here
as
prospective
defendants,
we
are
here
as
targets
of
this
investigation.
we
need
the
advice
of
counsel,
and
we
were
threatened
they
said.
and
so
the
judge
for
the
integrity
of
this
process
i
suppose
held
a
hearing
to
find
out
who
threatened
and
when
he
was
told
especially
that
a
member
of
the
inquiry
staff
did
it.
and
so
he
heard
testimony
about
one
or
two
other
witnesses
and
then
came
to
the
particular
member
of
the
staff
and
questioned
and
he
was
told
you
heard
what
was
said
and
what
you
say
about
it.
and
your
honor
see
here,
there
on
the
page,
that
he
tells
his
part
of
the
story
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
i
don't
know
my
exact
language,
but
i
indicated
that
we
did
not
intend
to
pussyfoot
with
them.
we
were
not
trying
to
trap
them
in
any
manner,
but
the
testimony
and
evidence
have
come
before
us
in
the
course
of
our
investigation
that
someone
and
the
employer
gotham
claims
service,
these
appellants
did
business
on
their
partnership
name
of
gotham
claims
service,
had
with
some
frequency
obtained
statements
from
defendants
holding
themselves
out
to
be
from
defendants
carriers
and
also
holding
themselves
out
to
be
from
other
agencies
and
in
one
instance
the
district
attorney's
office.
that
our
investigation
had
disclosed
that
these
statements
had
been
tampered
with
and
that
it
was
these
statements
--
and
that
it
was
relative
to
this
that
we
wish
to
speak
to
them
to
find
out
if
these
statements
were
actually
taken
by
gotham
claims
service
for
what
attorneys
these
statements
were
taken,
and
whether
the
tampering
was
done
by
them
or
their
employees,
or
a
direction
of
some
attorney.
and
then
he
says
something
else,
he
finally
says,
i
further
stated
that
in
my
opinion
there
was
prima
facie
evidence
in
the
event
that
the
clients
decided
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
district
attorney's
office.
all
this
had
happened
before
these
people
were
called
into
the
courtroom
to
be
questioned
and
in
light
of
this
they
repeatedly
made
their
protest
to
the
judge
that
they
want
the
help
of
counsel
while
they
were
being
questioned
and
he
nevertheless
denied.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
no
your
honor
they
weren't
yet.
their
further
investigation
is
being
held
up
pending
this
litigation.
now
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
now
they
faced
their
refusal
solely
on
the
ground
that
their
counsel
was
not
allowed
to
be
present?
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
they
did
not.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
no
sir.
there
is
no
other
questions
in
this
case
that
whether
or
not
the
denial
to
them
or
the
presence
of
their
own
counsel
during
the
questioning
in
the
courtroom
so
vitiated
the
process
as
to
render
this
commitment
void,
that's
the
sole
question
before
this
court.
now
what
actually
is
done
with
this
evidence
that
is
gathered
at
the
judicial
inquiry
is
disclosed
now
by
a
report
made,
an
interim
report
by
mr.
justice
arkwright
to
the
appellate
division.
in
quotations
from
that
report
in
our
brief,
he
says
how
many
doctors
the
evidence
that
the
doctors
sent
up
for
a
prosecution
before
the
medical
board,
how
many
are
sent
to
the
district
attorney's
office
and
it
shows
the
closest
liaison
between
this
office
and
the
district
attorney's
office,
it's
right
there
in
his
own
report,
it's
just
as
though
they
were
in
an
anteroom
of
the
district
attorney's
office
once
you
take
people
after
they
are
examined,
right
into
the
other
room
for
presentation
for
indictment,
i
said
you
take
people,
i
mean
you
take
their
evidence.
now,
the
reason
for
emphasizing
this
is
that
the
brief
for
appellee
and
the
position
of
mr.
justice
arkwright
in
his
answer,
made
very
light
of
the
whole
thing.
they
preceded
on
as
though
(inaudible)
as
though
this
was
something
else,
as
though
they
were
just
conducting
some
sort
of
preliminary
inquiry
and
thereafter
a
report
is
made
for
the
appellate
division
and
the
appellate
division
then
says
what
to
do
with
it.
now,
in
words
that
of
course
is
so
but
in
reality
and
there
is
own
report
shows,
that
isn't
anymore
so
than
if
the
people
here
involved
were
clerks
in
the
district
attorney's
office
gathering
the
information
so
as
to
bring
it
into
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
sir,
a
separate
judicial
proceeding
or
a
separate
administrative
proceeding
because
doctors
are
involved
as
well
as
lawyer,
the
firemen
or
prosecution
for
crime.
yes,
those
are
all
separate
technically
separate
steps.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
none
except
as
a
recommendation
from
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
is
called
what,
this
is
a
judicial
inquiry.
it
may
be
not
the
traditional
judgment
of
conviction.
it
may
not
be
the
traditional
order
of
disbarment,
and
what
is
the
recommendation
by
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
who
has
taken
testimony
and
considered
it
judicially
and
comes
to
a
conclusion.
technically
your
honor
when
mr.
justice
arkwright
gets
through,
he
does
nothing
more
then
send
his
report
to
the
appellate
division,
but
that's
only
technically.
it's
as
if
the
clerk
and
the
anteroom
in
the
district
attorney's
office,
when
he
gets
through
examining
somebody,
and
develops
a
case
against
him,
he
doesn't
himself
make
a
judgment
of
conviction
he
takes
it
in
for
the
further
steps.
substantially
what
happens
is
that
here
is
where
these
people
are
being
tried.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
at
least
for
that
end
(inaudible)
and
the
recommendation
that
certain
things
be
done.
we
have
in
the
record
here
an
excerpt
from
the
report
which
indicates
what
the
appellate
division
authorized
mr.
justice
arkwright
and
mr.
hurley
to
do
with
these
things.
it's
only
formal
approval
by
the
appellate
division.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well,
standard
in
the
sense
that
the
two
or
three
we've
had
before
have
--
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
that,
i
don't
what
they
did
in
the
others,
but
the
orders
seemed
to
be
the
same
thing.
there
is
nothing
standard
of
this
because
there
is
no
statute,
there
is
no
rule,
there
has
been
one
decision
by
our
court
of
appeals,
the
old
carlen
case.
this
is
breaking
new
ground
in
this
respect.
this
problem
of
representation
by
a
counsel
didn't
arise
in
the
earlier
investigations
we
had
in
new
york.
now
your
honors
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
procedure.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes.
now
in
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
and
yes
what
your
honor
said
is
true,
but
it
doesn't
reach
this
point.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
your
honor.
except
that,
that
decision
left
open
the
question
as,
for
whose
benefit
privacy
is
to
be
maintained.
this
order
and
the
proceedings
here,
the
record
here
showed
that
the
privacy
is
maintained
for
the
benefit
of
the
appellate.
they
were
the
ones
being
questioned
and
secondly
aside
from
that,
there
wasn't
any
question
in
any
one
of
the
prior
investigations
as
to
whether
or
not
privacy
reaches
to
the
point,
when
a
man
accused
in
every
realistic
sense
of
the
word
cannot
come
in
with
his
counsel.
counsel
under
common
law
traditions
have
been
entrusted
with
the
lives,
the
secrets
of
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
human
beings
for
centuries.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well
that
would
have
been
a
little
more
difficult
because
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
because
before
the
grand
jury
you
could
do
it,
the
statutes
and
the
decisions
were
not
so
clear
and
the
difficulty
is
manifested
by
the
fact
that
he
was
clamped
into
jail
here
when
he
said
i
don't
want
to
answer
without
my
attorney
being
present,
that
was
his
difficulty.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
he'd
have
difficulty
under
our
state
law
for
this
reason.
he
was
not
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
the
judge
didn't
look
at
it
that
way.
that
was
his
difficulty.
the
judge
kept
saying
all
through
the
hearing
i
advise
you
or
i
rule
that
you
are
only
a
witness.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
that's
right.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
he
never
did,
he
never
got
to
it,
in
the
first
place.
we
say
that
he
being
a
potential
defendant
had
all
his
constitutional
rights,
among
them
the
right
in
the
first
place
to
be
represented
by
counsel
and
that
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well
that
depends
upon
the
--
yes
there
are
situations,
but
in
this
case
he
had
the
right
as
a
potential
defendant
to
representation
in
a
criminal
case
by
--
a
potentially
(inaudible)
by
a
counsel.
in
our
state
we
allow
counsel
in
all
criminal
cases.
now,
getting
back
to
the
question
or
the
implications
as
i
get
them
from
your
honor's
question,
about
he
could
have
invoked
the
state
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
of
course
he
could
have,
but
does
the
existence
of
one
constitutional
right
constitute
a
basis
for
the
denial
of
another?
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
not
if
he
has
it,
now
of
course
we
claim
he
had,
now
the
second
thing
is,
these
were
laymen.
there
are
difficulties
about
invoking
constitutional
rights.
there
are
intricate
angles
of
waiver,
depends
upon
how
much
you
say,
and
what
attitude
you
take
and
whether
you
do
it
on
the
affirmative.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
he
could
go
out
in
the
hall
and
consult
his
counsel
and
that
only
emphasizes
the
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
in
this
case
the
judge
below
at
certain
junctures
told
them
that
they
may
consult
their
counsel
outside.
now
your
honor
will
surely
know,
the
counsel
outside
cannot
know
the
course
of
proceedings,
the
conjunction
at
which
a
man
is
asked
the
question.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
he
could
tell
him
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
it
all
depends
upon
whether
or
not
counsel
wants
to
act
clumsily
or
whether
he
wants
to
act
to
the
best
of
his
ability
with
full
knowledge.
now
counsel
outside
doesn't
know
exactly
what's
happening.
here
is
a
(inaudible)
layman
who
comes
out
and
tells
him,
the
judge
told
me
this
or
that.
that
has
happened.
i
have
been
outside
with
trials
there.
it's
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
get
it
from
them
whether
layman
or
lawyer
to
get
the
exact
conjunction
at
which
whatever
question
arouse.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yeah.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yeah.
he
didn't
have
to
resort
to
that.
every
man
doesn't
have
to
claim
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
he
could
not
--
if
he
could
have
protected
--
i
will
say
two
things.
in
the
first
place
he
could
not
have
protected
himself
and
plead
no
reason
adequately
if
he
didn't
have
his
lawyer
in
there.
and
then
in
second
place
even
if
he
could,
if
he
faced
is
a
criminal
trial,
he
is
entitled
to
be
presented
in
pretrial
proceedings
by
counsel
and
he
doesn't
have
to
have
counsel
on
an
as-if
basis,
counsel
standing
outside
to
get
information
from
him
in
a
frightened
condition
or
otherwise.
if
counsel
is
going
to
represent
somebody,
if
he
has
a
right
to
representation
by
counsel,
it
must
be
then
and
there.
there's
another
consideration
as
was
indicated
by
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
groban
case.
this
in
an
in-camera
proceeding.
while
it's
been
sanctioned
in
the
karlin
case
and
never
taken
up
higher,
this
is
still
an
in-camera
proceeding
with
all
the
invidious
and
unfortunate
consequences
that
in-camera
proceedings
have
to
this
day.
an
in-camera
proceeding
is
not
only
vicious
when
it
was
conducted
in
history,
it
is
infinitely
more
vicious
in
these
more
civilized
times.
now
in
such
a
situation
it
is
a
very
comfort
and
great
protection
for
a
man
when
he
is
being
grilled
by
a
judge,
a
large
staff
of
counsel
in
the
courtroom
to
have
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
and
he
is
entitled
to
it.
now
we
say
your
honors
that
that
the
decisions
below
were
rested
on
the
misapprehension
of
the
reach
of
the
decision
of
this
case
in
matter
of
groban.
and
while
dissecting
precedence
is
hardly
a
profitable
undertaking
in
most
times,
in
this
case
it
will
help
to
focus
the
problem
down,
the
considerations
in
relation
to
this
problem
were
fully
developed
by
the
three
opinions
in
matter
of
groban
and
we
say
that
in
substantial,
realistic
respect,
the
case
of
matter
of
groban
is
based
upon
considerations
that
do
not
apply
here
and
entirely
different
from
the
considerations
that
apply
here
and
that
in
this
case
the
man
was
entitled
to
his
counsel.
now
there
were
the
three
opinions,
one
by
mr.
justice
reed
and
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
there
was
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black.
first
i
think
it
is
profitable
to
see
that
the
considerations
that
moved
the
prevailing
opinion
of
mr.
justice
reed
are
entirely
absent
and
different
here
and
i
shall
show
that
even
the
concurring
opinion
was
based
on
considerations
that
has
applied
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case
would
warrant
a
holding
here,
require
a
holding
here,
the
counsel
should
have
been
allowed.
in
the
first
place,
we
had
in
the
groban
case,
a
fire
marshal
making
an
investigation
of
causes
of
a
fire.
perhaps
the
situation
as
you
view
it
as
a
whole
(inaudible),
but
practically
through
the
imagination
you
could
see
that
one
cannot
compare,
considerations
applying
to
the
investigation
of
a
fire
by
a
fire
marshal
to
hearing
in
the
courtroom,
the
old
appellate
division
courtroom
with
bench
as
long
as
this,
judge
in
a
courtroom
outside
as
lighted
up
as
this
courtroom
with
a
large
staff
of
counsel
on
one
side
having
a
man
in
there
and
he
is
not
to
be
represented.
the
situations
are
entirely
different
in
the,
and
the
difference
is
even
shown
in
the
very
open
book
of
our
language.
people
say
what's
your
hurry
where
is
the
fire.
the
fire
marshal
is
in
a
hurry.
he
has
to
do
things
quickly.
it
didn't
happen
to
be
in
that
case
that
it
was
done
in
such
a
hurry
but
the
ruling
had
to
be
made
on
a
basis
that
he
would
exercise
his
power
this
way
and
that
way
your
honors
kind
of
made
a
ruling
for
every
hour
of
these
function,
but
he
was
a
fire
marshal.
he
may
have
to
run
with
some
people
right
down
and
while
things
are
smoldering
and
find
out
what's
the
cause
of
the
fire
and
in
such
circumstances
to
require
representation
and
perhaps
some
reasonable
time
for
preparation.
it
violates
the
essential
function
involved.
we
have
no
such
problem
here
and
this
is
a
long
investigation,
judicial
investigation,
hearings
in
a
courtroom
presided
over
by
a
judge.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
hurry.
now
in
the
groban
case
it
was
prominently
stated
both
in
the
majority
opinion
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
that
all
that
you
had
there
was
that
the
man
who
came
here
to
this
court
and
complained,
said
that
he
suspected
or
that
there
was
a
suspicion
against
him.
and
both
mr.
justice
reed's
opinion
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
had
worded
to
the
fact
that
this
was
not
anything
aimed
at
a
man
who
have
been
accused.
there
was
a
suspicion
and
mr.
justice
reed
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
the
suspicion
that
was
--
they
had
argued
before
this
court,
was
without
even
any
(inaudible)
or
any
proof
or
any
affidavit
to
sustain
the
fact
that
the
fire
marshal
had
any
suspicion
against
the
man
involved
in
groban.
and
you
have
no
such
problem
here
because
before
the
questioning
commenced,
the
very
judge
was
informed
in
that
proceeding
that
his
assistant
had
already
told
the
man
that
they
had
gathered
against
him
evidence,
prima
facie
evidence
sufficient
to
make
out
a
crime
and
we
won't
pussyfoot
with
you.
if
you
don't
play
ball
we'll
send
it
to
the
district
attorney.
so
that
in
the
groban
case
you
had
a
suspicion,
and
here
you
have
a
man
who
in
every
real
sense
of
the
word
and
its
meaning
in
the
english
language
was
accused.
the
brief
for
appellee
and
that's
the
argument
we'll
talk
about
accusation
in
the
technical
sense.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well
as
i
remember
the
murchison
case
which
i
didn't
cite
here
i
don't
think
that
there'd
be
much
difference
but
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
say,
difficult
enough
to
focus
on
the
one
problem
and
perhaps
the
analogy
might
be
misleading
and
i
have
really
haven't
considered
it
from
that
point
of
view.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
investigation
and
will
involve
the
murchison
situation
because
this
judge
sits
in
a
dual
capacity
explicitly
under
the
(inaudible).
he
is
both
investigator
and
justice
of
the
supreme
court.
he
investigates
and
he
adjudicates,
but
that
problem
is
not
involved
in
this.
this
is
solely
the
question
of
right
of
representation
by
counsel.
now
in
another
point
that
was
made
in
the
prevailing
opinion
in
groban
was
that
in
any
event,
if
anything
was
done
unfairly
to
extract
evidence
from
the
person
who
ultimately
is
charged
with
crime
that
can
be
shown
upon
a
subsequent
prosecution
at
the
prosecution
level
as
a
basis
for
a
plea
to
exclude
like
in
the
general
considerations
of
the
forced
evidence
or
involuntary
evidence
of
whether
there
was
something
on
there.
now
that's
the
very
important
thing
to
remember
because
in
this
case
these
people
had
no
such
chance
whatever,
these
people
are
called
to
give
evidence
before
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
under
our
local
practice
act
and
under
the
common
law
everywhere,
when
you
give
evidence
in
court
(inaudible)
that's
it,
you
have
no
more
defenses.
you
can't
impeach
that
in
any
subsequent
trial
except
on
relevancy,
but
i
mean
as
to
it's
--
the
genuineness
of
the
evidence
that
was
given.
now
in
the
concurring
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
emphasis
was
laid
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
there
was
not
aimed
at
suspect
and
the
thought
was
developed
from
which
i
rely
here
to
some
extent,
that
if
there
are
differences,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
concurring
opinion
it
reserved
on
the
decision
made
and
the
concurring
opinion
as
i
read
it,
and
this
sounds
probably
i'm
sure
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
he
knows
what
he
wrote
and
i'm
just
reading
it
and
imagining
the
(inaudible).
that
was
no
general
warrant
in
the
groban
case
to
investigate
people
without
counsel,
no
matter
how
near
you
get
to
the
suspect
line
and
so
on.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
there
wrote
the
sentence
that
if
there
are
differences
in
degree
a
due
regard
for
due
process
requires
that
those
differences
be
given
their
significance.
now
here
we
don't
have
any
differences
of
degree.
we
have
a
substantially
different
situation.
we
have
a
court
process
and
not
a
fire
marshal's
investigation
or
anybody
else's
investigation.
this
is
called
an
investigation,
but
it's
made
by
a
court.
a
court
in
all
its
aspects
functions
judicially.
a
court
has
administrative
functions,
but
in
the
whole,
in
the
gross
and
scope
of
their
judicial
functions,
administrative
aspects
of
judicial
functions.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well
i'm
sorry
if
you
got
that
impression
it's
my
fault.
i
think
the
danger
maybe
as
great
perhaps
of
one
case
as
in
the
other.
i
point
out
that
in
fact
according
to
that
record
and
this
the
danger
here
was
infinitely
greater
than
it
was
there
and
then
i
point
out
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
judicial
process
that
the
court
has
to
take
account
of
the
way
things
are
done
in
life,
that
what
the
court
may
have
to
reluctantly
yield
to
a
fire
marshal
it
doesn't
at
all
have
to
either
reluctantly
or
yield
to
a
judge.
those
things
happen
all
the
time
in
the
judicial
process,
and
then
they
are
all
like
a
mathematical
formula.
you
first
take
account
of
realities,
and
i
think
that
pervading
the
whole
groban
opinion
and
this
language
shows
it
was,
that
the
majority
side,
was
that
this
was
a
fire
marshal.
we
are
dealing
with
fires.
fires
need
expedi
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
in
there,
i
said
before
in
that
case,
it
happened
that
the
fire
was
over,
but
it
is
hardly
to
be
expected
that
this
court
will
make
a
decision
for
a
fire
marshal
when
he
is
at
the
fire
and
then
what
happens
a
half
hour
later
or
a
half
hour
before
or
a
half
hour
or
a
day
later,
those
things
are
done
that
way.
maybe
if
a
fire
marshal
comes
back
here
or
a
fire
marshal's
case
where
the
thing
had
been
over
for
six
or
eight
weeks,
maybe
your
honors
might
think
that
the
considerations
of
fine
even
to
a
fire
marshal
should
not
apply
to
a
situation
six
or
eight
weeks
later.
i
do
not
say
that
our
man
was
in
less
danger,
if
he
were
before
one
or
another.
what
i
said
about
the
fire
marshal
was
try
to
read
the
considerations
that
the
judicial
process
has
to
wrestle
with
in
concrete
situations.
now
what
it
says
about
a
fire
marshal
is
one
thing,
what
it
says
about
a
judge,
holding
a
hearing
in
an
open
court
with
a
large
staff
of
counsel
on
another
side
is
another
thing.
but
further
my
distinctions
go
in
showing
that
in
point
of
fact
the
facts
disclosed
by
that
record
showed
an
infinitely
less
situation
of
danger
requiring
protection
than
ours.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
what
your
honor?
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
in
the
hearing
room,
the
presiding
justice
and
several
members
of
the
staff
of
counsel.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
for
the
judicial
--
for
him,
for
the
judge.
this
order
points
to
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
huh?
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
by
the
judge,
appointed
by
the
appellant
division
and
employed
by
the
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes,
there's
a
charge
on
the
city
budget.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
no,
they
are
just
called
under
the
judiciary
law
counsel
appointed
to
aid
in
the
investigation.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
the
private
lawyer
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
practicing
publicly,
but
the
got
their
appointment,
they
have
their
appointment,
they
are
public
officials
in
that
sense
of
the
word.
they
are
like
(inaudible).
they
are
investigating
attorneys,
they
(inaudible)
the
district
attorney's
office.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
no
your
honor
but
the
order
is
printed
and
that
refers
to
the
statute.
the
order
of
the
appellate
division
appointed
the
judge
to
hold
the
term.
it
also
appointed
him
to
be
the
investigator
and
then
it
also
appointed
mr.
hurley
as
counsel
to
aid
the
judge,
not
as
the
attorney,
to
aid
the
judge
in
the
investigation
and
then
it
gives
him
authority
to
appoint
a
staff
and
they
get
a
budget,
and
it's
like
a
temporary
special
prosecutor.
the
judge
himself
is
paid
his
own
judicial
salary,
he
gets
no
more.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
it
goes
back
to
the
appellate
division,
gets
its
approval
and
then
it
goes
to
the
district
attorney
for
prosecution
or
for
disbarment
or
if
a
doctor
is
involved
to
the
medical
board,
and
the
record
does
contain
the
statement
as
to
what
had
been
done
with
the
evidence
gathered
at
or
about
the
time
that
this
situation
arose.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
the
judge
himself
of
the
special
prosecution.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well,
now
for
whatever
we
see
in
the
record
that
maybe
so,
but
in
the
reality
and
in
accordance
with
newspaper
items
that
i've
also
included
in
the
record,
they
cooperate
with
the
district
attorney's
office
and
mr.
hurley
is
in-charge
of
that
staff
and
he
could
tell
us
more.
they
really
do
not
in
any
realistic
sense
of
the
word
end.
they
just
carry
on.
they
take
that
evidence,
we
know
in
brooklyn
and
we
read
it
in
the
papers
all
the
time.
they
cooperate
with
mr.
aaron
cooter
who
is
an
assistant
of
mr.
silva,
the
district
attorney
and
they
carry
through
the
prosecution
though
the
disbarment
or
whatever
it
is
that
happens
to
be
recommended.
it
is
not
a
confined
function
that
the
judge
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
the
judge
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
and
the
stenographer.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
and
some
of
his
investigators.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
and
the
witness.
now
from
time
to
time,
and
at
one
time
in
this
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
i
don't
know
whether
any
others
were
there,
but
--
and
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
permitted
to
be
there.
i
was
there
on
one
occasion
and
i
saw
about
12
people
sitting
around.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
i
was
inside.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
now
that
was
in
connection
with
a
special
motion
on
another
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
sir,
not
in
this
case
and
in
the
other
case
i
was
permitted
to
come
in
because
again
the
witness
refused
to
answer
questions
unless
his
counsel
was
present
and
the
judge
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
permitted
me
to
come
in
the
one
case,
but
that
was
another
case.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
the
appellate
division
memorandum
makes
that
perfectly
clear
that
the
whole
case
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
substantially
your
honor.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
no.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
not
the
judge.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
they
nominate
the
lawyer
because
i
think
it's
a
requirement
under
the
statute.
they
nominated
the
lawyer
and
they
nominated
a
distinguished
lawyer
mr.
hurley
of
(inaudible).
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
no
your
honor.
it's
the
same
statute.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
the
appellate
division
did
that
in
a
decision.
if
i
answer
your
honor
inadvertently
here
and
perhaps
mislead
you,
the
appellate
division
enjoined
privacy
in
the
older,
but
in
another
decision
which
we
have
included
in
our
brief,
they
indicated
that
since
in
that
case,
this
companion
case,
the
matter
of
m.
anonymous,
the
person
who
came
before
the
justice
was
not
a
mere
witness
as
to
act
of
somebody
else,
but
was
himself
a
target
of
the
investigation
that
the
judge
might
well
--
very
well
have
exercised
his
discretion
to
allow
counsel
with
him
in
courtroom
while
he
was
being
questioned.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
yes
sir.
in
the
order
it
just
enjoined
to
maintain
privacy
and
that
refers
to
the
statute.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
there
are
opinions
which
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief
that
show
that
counsel
had
been
uniformly
excluded,
except
for
the
one
instance
after
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
--
where
i
appeared
with
another
witness
who
again
refused,
that
time
he
was
(inaudible)
to
go
in
without
counsel
and
i
was
permitted
and
that
was
the
only
instance
and
the
judge
himself
told
me
that,
that
was
the
only
exception,
but
theretofore
he
had
maintained
a
rigid
adherence
to
exclusion.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
now
your
honors
there
are
two
cases
that
the
filed
brief
mentions,
at
the
end
of
term
this
court
had
two
cases
involving
the
denial
of
counsel
during
a
period
of
preliminary
police
investigation,
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
briefly
that
those
cases
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
kind
of
situation.
in
those
cases
it
was
pointed
out,
in
both
opinions
that
whatever
was
said
to
the
prosecuting
authorities
was
said
voluntarily,
whereas
here
the
people
were
brought
in
under
compulsion,
to
be
raised
by
their
heals
if
they
refused
to
answer,
and
secondly
you
have
the
feature
in
those
two
cases,
the
(inaudible)
case
that
if
there
were
some
abuse
involved
in
procuring
the
evidence
that
maybe
shown
for
the
purposes
of
later
exclusion,
which
i've
shown
before
does
not
exist
here.
once
they
give
their
evidence
they
are
gone.
now,
there
has
been
some
attempt
to
equate
this
with
a
grand
jury
procedure
and
i
need
only
refer
to
what
mr.
justice
black
said
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
groban
about
the
attempt
to
do
that.
this
of
course
is
not
anything
like
a
grand
jury
procedure,
certainly
not
in
our
state.
they
couldn't
get
him
to
come
in
and
testify
without
giving
him
immunity,
if
he
is
a
target
of
the
investigation.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well
he
would
have
to
claim
it,
but
he'd
get
immunity.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
and
they'd
change
in
the
statute.
formally
if
they
ask
him
questions
he
got
immunity.
now
--
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
there
are
for
minor
crimes.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
indeed.
my
client
didn't
testify,
but
others
who
do
indeed.
that's
one
of
the
functions
and
purposes
of
this.
if
a
crime
discloses
one
that
could
be
prosecuted
by
information,
you
pick
it
up
from
here,
you
bring
in
there,
you
prosecute,
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
and
then
one
other
point
i
want
to
mention
is
this
that
some
attempt
has
been
made
in
the
brief
heretofore
and
i
think
obliquely
or
briefly
in
this
brief,
to
say
that
this
right
of
representation
by
counsel
in
the
criminal
case
doesn't
apply
until
you
have
practically
called
the
man
up
for
trial.
and
verbally
that
was
arguable
before
the
end
of
term
of
this
court,
and
now
even
verbally
that
is
not
arguable.
if
a
man
has
a
right
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel,
he
has
the
right
to
have
him
when
it
is
most
important.
if
a
man
goes
in
before
this
judge
and
gives
his
evidence
and
has
no
counsel,
then
it
doesn't
matter
if
had
john
w.
davis
represent
him
at
the
prosecution.
he
is
a
goner,
because
all
his
rights
are
gone
and
there
is
no
way
to
reclaim,
and
one
of
those
preliminary
police
investigation
cases
your
honors
made
clear
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
clark,
that
the
right
for
counsel
commences
at
the
point
in
free
trial,
i
think
the
word
was
proceedings,
but
in
the
scope
of
the
setting,
i
take
it
to
mean
that
at
the
pre-trial
action
whatever
it
is,
where
the
man
comes
in
for
jeopardy.
in
this
case
if
the
man
didn't
have
his
counsel
while
he
was
before
the
judge,
he
will
have
been
prosecuted
later
on,
if
they
had
as
they
say
they
have
a
case
against
him
for
crime
without
ever
having
effective
representation
of
counsel.
this
case
your
honors
was
in
the
court.
i
am
aware
that
i
have
made
this
point
in
several
aspects.
this
was
in
the
courtroom
conducted
by
a
judge.
this
was
part
of
the
judicial
process,
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
the
court
is
the
one
place
in
this
world
where
the
denial
to
a
person
charged
to
refuse
of
counsel,
should
not
be
allowed.
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
reserved
5
minutes
in
my
(inaudible)
mr.
raphael
h.
weissman
well,
i
do
it
very
quickly
perhaps
(inaudible).
i
want
to
make
answers
to
unfinished
questions
from
bench,
first
to
say
that
every
witness
would
come
with
a
counsel
that's
partially
(inaudible).
it
isn't
to
claim
that
every
witness
would
come.
if
every
witness
came
with
the
counsel
this
investigation
would
never
be
finished.
that
doesn't
help
this
problem.
it's
only
such
a
witness
as
becomes
the
target
of
the
investigation
who
then
becomes
really
a
defendant
who
has
the
right
for
counsel.
and
that
brings
the
numbers
down
so
that
the
significance
of
all
the
figures
given,
disappear.
the
claim
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decided
that
a
witness
hasn't
got
right
to
counsel
is
true,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this,
if
this
man
weren't
in
a
position
of
a
witness
these
appellants,
to
what
somebody
else
did,
i
wouldn't
claim
their
right
to
counsel
and
they
wouldn't
have
it.
only
when
it
became
apparent
that
they
no
longer
witnesses,
but
defendants,
targets
of
the
investigation,
then
they
were
entitled
to
counsel.
and
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
the
question
that,
it
had
been
cleared
up
and
this
is
the
most
important
thing.
it
is
mr.
hurley
and
the
judge
now
who
without
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
appellate
division
referred
these
matters
to
the
district
attorney
for
prosecution.
now
i
was
handicapped.
i
suspected
that
myself.
mr.
justice
arkwright
filed
his
final
report
and
i
wrote
a
letter
for
appellate
division
en
banc
asking
for
a
copy
of
that
report
for
transmission
to
this
court
in
eight
of
the
pending
cases
and
the
court
met
in
en
banc
and
denied
my
request.
i
think
the
counsel
ought
to
produce
here
for
the
information
of
this
court
the
final
report
of
mr.
justice
arkwright,
and
that
will
tell
you
precisely
the
number
of
witnesses,
the
number
of
people
who
were
targets
of
the
investigation,
what
can
they
do
with
the
evidence
and
how
it
is
done.
and
it
will
clarify
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
as
to
whether
there
is
some
intervening
discretion
involved.
even
if
they
were,
the
case
is
not
much
weaker
than
it
was,
but
now
it
been
made
perfectly
clear,
and
i
think
the
report
ought
to
be
produced
so
the
court
should
have
it,
that
there
is
no
intervening
discretion.
as
mr.
hurley
and
the
judge
themselves
are
a
norm
of
the
prosecution.
thanks.
