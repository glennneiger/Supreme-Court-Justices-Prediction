i
don't
find
at
all
the
distinction
that
you
are
making.
as
i
understand
that
your
--
you
of
course
have
to
accept
the
groban
decision
because
there
it
is,
and
as
i
understand
the
distinction
you
have
been
making,
it
suggests
that
there
is
less
danger
of
unfairness
in
the
case
of
a
man
not
represented
by
counsel
if
the
hearing
officer
is
a
fire
marshal
than
there
is
for
a
man
unrepresented
by
counsel
if
the
hearing
officer
is
a
judge,
do
i
gather
that
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fire
was
over
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
understand
of
course
your
point
about
the
suspicion
in
that
case
as
contrasted
to
the
statement
of
the
investigator?
