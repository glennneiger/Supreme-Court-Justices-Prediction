mr.
denis
m.
hurley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
can
probably
clarify
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
has
been
asking
by
a
brief
reference
to
the
order
of
the
appellate
division
establishing
this
judicial
inquiry
and
investigation.
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
i
have
set
out
the
order
in
an
appendix,
appendix
a
at
page
27
of
my
brief.
and
there
briefly
this
order
was
made
on
the
21st
of
january
1957
by
the
court
and
signed
by
the
presiding
justice
of
the
appellate
division.
and
your
honors
will
note
that
it's
in
the
matter
of
the
petition
of
the
brooklyn
bar
association
that
this
investigation
was
launched
into
unprofessional
conduct
by
attorneys
and
others
acting
in
concert
with
them
in
kings
county.
now
there's
the
order
on
page
27.
then
on
page
28,
the
order
sets
forth
the
scope
of
the
inquiry,
and
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
as
set
forth
therein
under
the
various
paragraphs
one,
two,
three,
four
with
respect
to
alleged
improper
practices
and
abuses
by
attorneys
and
counselors
at
law,
with
respect
to
alleged,
corrupt
and
unethical
practices
including
the
practice
of
solicitation
in
obtaining
retainers,
and
in
the
subsequent
prosecution
and
disposition
of
claims
with
respect
to
any
other
practice
involving
professional
misconduct,
fraud,
deceit
corruption,
crime,
misdemeanor
and
so
on.
then
the
order
provides
that
judge
arkwright
be
appointed
to
conduct
this
additional
special
term
with
full
power
to
compel
the
attendance
of
witnesses,
their
testimony
under
oath,
the
production
of
books
and
papers.
that
it
was
to
begin
on
the
22nd
of
january
57,
and
then
–
i,
an
attorney
and
counselor
at
law,
who
has
been
duly
designated
by
the
brooklyn
bar
association
is
designated
to
aid
the
justice
in
the
conduct
of
the
inquiry
and
in
the
prosecution
of
the
investigation
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
judiciary
law
set
forth.
then
the
last
paragraph
concerning
privacy
as
you
will
notice
from
the
introductory
words
is
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
reputation
of
innocent
persons.
now
immediately
following
the
order
–
oh
and
the
one
other
very
important
factor,
the
last
directory
paragraph
states
that
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
inquiry
and
investigation,
the
justice
shall
make
and
file
with
this
court,
that
is
with
the
appellate
division,
his
report
setting
forth
his
proceedings,
his
findings
and
his
recommendations.
in
other
words,
going
back
to
very
first
case
in
new
york
that
i
know
of
where
such
an
inquiry
was
ordered
on
the
application
of
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
the
first
department
in
1928,
in
that
case
the
appellate
division
said
and
i
cited
the
case
in
my
brief,
matter
of
association
of
the
bar,
that
is
the
leading
case,
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
--
it
had
inherent
power
to
order
this
investigation,
but
it
also
had
statutory
power
to
order
such
an
inquiry,
a
preliminary
investigation
as
this.
and
the
court
said,
that
because
the
appellate
division
by
virtue
of
section
90
of
the
judiciary
law,
which
is
printed
in
my
brief
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
immediately
following
the
order
appendix
b
on
page
30,
in
this
statute
in
the
judiciary
law
section
90,
plenary
power
as
i
can
see
that
is
vested
in
the
appellate
division
although
the
conduct
of
attorneys
they
have
regulatory
control,
disciplinary
control
over
attorneys,
which
incidentally
as
i
understand
it
from
judge
cardozo's
opinion
goes
back
to
some
300
years
in
england,
with
the
inns
of
court
where
the
justices
delegated
their
power
to
the
members
of
the
inns
of
court,
all
of
which
is
very
elaborately
set
forth
in
chief
judge
cardozo's
opinion
in
the
karlin
case
that's
been
referred
to
here.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no
your
honor,
that
is
very
interesting
question
and
we
have
found
that
there
is
no
such
power
in
the
justice
to
grant
immunity.
in
new
york
it
must
be
granted
--
it
must
be
granted
by
special
statute
to
each
separate
court
or
commission
or
body
that
may
exercise
the
power.
recently
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh,
he
must
definitely
respect
the
claim.
in
other
words,
if
a
witness
said
i
claim
my
–
i
invoke
my
constitution
the
court
will
have
to
uphold
it.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
but
i
thought
your
honor
was
talking
about
whether
the
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
in
other
words
as
i
understand
the
question,
and
the
judge
here,
judge
arkwright,
had
not
right
to
grant
the
witness
immunity
from
prosecution
and
compel
him
into
court.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
the
benefit
of
such
an
inquiry
as
this,
and
because
we
had
had
up
to
the
date
of
this
particular
proceeding,
we
had
60
witnesses
invoke
their
privilege,
24
of
whom
were
attorneys
and
these
attorneys
over
the
last
three
years
or
so
had
some
9500
cases
and
with
their
plea
of
immunity
we
just
can't
find
out,
we
can't
get
the
facts
from
these
attorneys.
we
have
been
trying
to
get
the
state
legislature
to
pass
legislation
so
that
a
judge
presiding
with
such
an
inquiry
as
this
may
have
the
power
to
grant
the
witness
immunity
and
thereby
compel
him
to
talk.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
if
he
claimed
that
he
would
be
incriminated
by
--
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
we
could
go
no
further
and
the
judge
repeatedly
in
this
case
has
upheld
witnesses
who
invoked
their
constitutional
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
the
judge
wouldn't
have
the
power
to
grant
him
immunity
from
prosecution.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
we
haven't
got
that
right.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
we
proceed
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
we
would
proceed.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no,
he
had
to
claim
his
privilege.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh,
no
we
would
ask
a
series
of
questions.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
continue
to
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right
and
then
i
have
usually
ended
with
a
sort
of
anomalous
question
mr.
jones
--
as
i
take
it
from
your
answers,
you
are
going
to
make
the
same
claim
with
respect
to
every
question
i
ask
you.
no
matter
what
the
question
is,
you
are
going
to
claim
--
you
are
going
to
invoke
your
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh!
no,
no,
as
a
matter
of
act
--
oh
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well,
in
this
particular
case
without
the
claim
of
immunity,
but
claiming
that
he
shouldn't
be
compelled
to
testify
because
his
counsel
wasn't
in
the
courtroom.
i
think
in
one
case
the
judge
held
him
in
contempt
on
16
questions
and
in
the
other
case
on
24
questions.
it
was
probably
all
over
in
each
instance
in
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
as
to
that,
as
to
that
particular
matter
we
have
the
matter
of
waiving?
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
it
maybe
waived,
it
maybe
waived
by
answering
relevant
questions
as
possible.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no
we
haven't,
we
haven't
had
that.
it's
either
been
an
outright
invocation
of
the
privilege
or
the
witness
has
testified.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
don't
follow
you
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no,
the
judge
--
the
judge
arkwright
and
now
judge
baker
has
upheld
every
witness
the
way
they've
invoked
a
privilege.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that
without
regard
to
what
the
question
is.
he
is
--
both
judges
are
very
conscious
of
this
rule
about
the
link
in
the
chain.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well
it
was
a
matter
of
probably
another
10
minutes
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
maybe,
as
i
recall
it,
i
think
that
with
respect
to
these
witnesses,
there
might
have
been
different
counsel
questioning
them.
i
think
i,
one
of
my
assistants
started
with
one
and
then
i
added
some
other
questions,
he
was
sick,
he
wasn't
well
and
he
has
to
be
relieved
and
i
took
over.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
frankly
i
wasn't
satisfied
with
the
questions
my
assistant
had
asked
so
then
i
asked
these
others.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
only
in
this,
only
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
this
particular
instance
where
this
assistant
of
mine
happened
to
get
sick.
he
--
judge
couldn't
hear
me.
he
said
he
had
a
terrible
cold
and
he
asked
me
if
i
please
take
over
and
ask
the
questions.
now
referring
if
your
honors
please
to
the
statute
this
will
answer
some
more
questions,
i
think
i
was
up
to
the
point
of
saying
that
the
appellate
division
has
full
control
of
the
lawyers.
and
this
order
that
i
have
just
referred
to
is
a
statutory
order
in
this
sense
that
it
follows
almost
literally
and
in
some
cases
verbatim
section
90
of
our
judiciary
law.
and
beginning
on
page
30
i
set
forth
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
judiciary
law
pertaining
to
such
a
proceeding
as
this.
and
then
if
you
get
down
to
about
the
middle
of
page
31,
you'll
see
that
there
is
language
there
to
the
effect
that
the
presiding
justice
of
the
appellate
division
to
which
charges
of
professional
misconduct
against
an
attorney
and
counsel
at
law
had
been
presented
may
make
an
order
directing,
and
then
it
talks
about
expenses,
how
the
expenses
have
to
be
paid,
and
then
down
below
that
that
would
as
to
a
specific
disciplinary
proceeding
against
attorney
a.
then
down
below
that
the
presiding
judge
may
also
make
an
order
directing
the
expense
of
a
preliminary
investigation
in
such
charge,
to
such
charges
to
be
paid
by
the
county
treasurer
of
the
county
and
so
forth
within
the
judicial
department.
and
the
subdivision
7,
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
any
district
attorney
within
the
department
when
so
designated
by
the
presiding
judge
to
prosecute
all
proceedings
for
the
removal
or
suspension
of
attorneys,
and
down
below
that,
or
in
county's
of
a
certain
size
that
presiding
justice
may
appoint
an
attorney
and
counsel
at
law
designated
by
a
duly
incorporated
bar
association
approved
by
him
to
prosecute
any
such
proceedings
and
so
on.
then
we
come
to
subdivision
10
which
is
the
statute
which
my
friend
attacks
as
i
say
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
never,
never
raised
in
the
courts
below.
now
if
your
honors
would
glance
through
subdivision
10
of
section
90
set
forth
in
full
on
page
32
about
any
statute
or
rule
to
the
contrary
not
withstanding
all
papers,
records
and
documents
upon
the
application
or
examination
of
any
person
for
admission
to
the
bar
and
so
forth
or
in
any
compliant,
on
any
compliant,
inquiry,
investigation
all
these
papers
shall
be
sealed
and
deemed
private
and
confidential
and
then
it
goes
into
the
question
that
the
court
may
on
good
cause
show,
divulge
these
papers
and
so
forth.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no,
admission
of
above
and
then
it
gets
into
and
upon
any
complaint
inquiry,
investigation,
or
proceeding.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right,
findings.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
we
think
both
and
judges
have
so
acted.
in
other
words,
if
a
doctor,
we
find
a
doctor,
who
is
just
as
bad
as
a
lawyer
or
if
a
insurance
adjuster
we
find
for
example
an
insurance
adjuster
for
an
insurance
company,
suppose
he
is
taking
bribes
and
we
have
evidence
of
that
that
he
is
being
bribed
in
these
cases.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
that's
--
you
see
the
duty
of
the
judge
and
my
duty
i
think
this
answers
another
question
of
the
court,
our
job
ends
when
judge,
when
the
judge
reports
his
proceedings,
his
findings
and
his
recommendations.
now
in
answering
a
question
before
my
friend
said,
maybe
i
could
elaborate
on
that.
well
what
the
appellate
division,
what
the
judge
has
done
so
far
is
to
with
respect
to
lawyers?
well
that
breaks
down
into
two
categories,
if
there
is
an
adverse
report.
it
breaks
down,
was
there
some
evidence
of
criminality
here
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer
and
the
appellate
division
has
decided
under
the
judiciary
law
to
send
the
whole
package
as
it
were
to
the
district
attorney,
they
say
the
district
attorney
has
it
now
for
criminal
investigation,
he
may
as
well
have
it
for
disciplinary
proceedings
too
and
under
the
statute
i've
just
read
the
district
attorney
maybe
designated
to
conduct
a
disciplinary--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
don't
concede
--
i
don't
understand
it
that
way
your
honor,
because
what
we
do,
what
judge
arkwright
does
in
this
preliminary
investigation
--
he
listens
to
the
witnesses,
he
listens
to
the
proof
and
the
exhibits
we
give
and
when
we
are
all
through
he
sends
out,
he
sends
these
the
stenographer's
minutes,
the
exhibits,
he
sends
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle
to
the
appellate
division
with
recommendations.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well
then
--
the
appellate
division
has
been
very
careful
about
what
it
does
in
these
matters.
it
doesn't
appear
here
but
what
it
does
is
this.
it
looks
over
what
the
judge
submits,
conferences
in
the
court
with
the
seven
judges,
and
then
they
determine
whether
or
not
follow
the
recommendations
of
judge
arkwright.
they
always
--
in
some
cases
they
haven't
followed
them.
they
haven't
followed
them.
in
one
case
where
i
recall
he
recommended
criminal
proceedings
they
didn't
follow
that,
they
just
sent
it
for
disciplinary
proceedings.
now
then
if
the
criminality
involved
and
when
it
goes
to
the
district
attorney.
the
appellate
division
has
been
very
careful
not
in
saying
that
it
would
refer
the
material
to
the
district
attorney,
but
they
make
an
order
first
they
made
resolutions
and
now
they
make
orders
in
this
way.
and
they
say
that
mr.
justice
arkwright
and
then
necessarily
the
counsel
may
in
their
discretion
if
they
see
fit
turn
over
material
to
the
district
attorney.
in
other
words,
they
are
being,
as
i
understand,
they're
being
very
careful
there
because
since
kings
county
is
in
the
second
judicial
department
if
there
should
be
criminal
prosecutions
later,
the
matter
may
eventually
get
back
on
a
criminal
appeal
to
that
court
and
the
appellate
division
doesn't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
having
prejudged
the
matter.
so
that
they
just
do
it
by
this
resolution
and
grant
us
permission
to
tell
the
matter
is
over.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh,
it's
through
the
whole
state
your
honor,
under
the
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
usually
it
is.
this
is
--
i
don't
think
it's
--
as
far
as
i
know
it's
never
been
done
before.
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
appellate
division
has
done
it
this
way
and
i
asked
them
why
they
were
doing
it
way,
and
they
put
it
upon
the
basis
that
he
gets
the
criminal
--
if
it's
criminal
he
goes
ahead
with
criminal,
if
he
doesn't
find
enough
to
indict
or
to
obtain
information
in
one
of
the
lower
courts,
then
he
goes
ahead
with
disciplinary
proceedings.
it's
the
first
time
it
has
been
done
and
then
i
asked
him
why,
in
addition
to
that,
and
they
said
they
wanted
to
save
money.
in
other
words,
if
they
designate
a
lawyer
appointed
by
the
bar
--
recommended
by
the
bar
association,
he
does
the
work,
he
keeps
track
of
his
hours
and
he
eventually
submits
his
bill
with
a
big
long
affidavit
to
the
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh
yes
indeed,
yes
indeed.
we're
held
to
strict
accountability
for
that.
we
have
–
we
have
to
account
to
the
comptroller
and
the
city
of
new
york
for
every
penny
that's
spent
there.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh
yes,
we've
done
that.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh
yes.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
independent
--
that's
what
i
was
going
to
say
as
to
our
limitations.
we
find
the
facts,
judge
arkwright
and
now
judge
baker
finds
the
facts
and
reports
to
the
appellate
division.
the
appellate
division
has
to
study
it,
and
then
it's
the
appellate
division
that
takes
some
action
or
doesn't
take
any
action.
if
they
say
it
goes
to
the
district
attorney,
then
the
district
attorney
considers
the
whole
thing
de
novo.
he's
an
independent
elected
official.
he
decides
whether
there
is
a
crime
here
and
frankly
i'm
sure
my
opponent
will
go
along
with
me
as
a
practical
proposition,
there
haven't
been
many
criminal
prosecutions
and
those
if
there
have
been,
they
very
frankly
too
haven't
been
too
successful.
the
jury
seemed
to
be
very
sympathetic
to
lawyers
and
to
others
in
this
type
of
matter.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh
yes
indeed.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
was
going
to
come
to
that.
our
matters
go
to
the
appellate
division,
the
appellate
division
to
the
district
attorney,
if
there
is
any
criminal
aspect
from
the
district
attorney,
he's
got
to
decide
what
he
wants
to
do
with
it
and
then
he
in
turn
must
go
before
a
grand
jury
and
present
the
matter,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
grand
jury
whether
or
not
to
indict.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well,
he
could
do
it
on
information,
but
that's
as
to
misdemeanors
conducted
on
what
we
call
our
court
of
special
sessions.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
we've
tried
to
keep
it
that
way,
in
other
words
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
think
it
is
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
i've
heard
it
--
i've
ever
heard
anybody
indicted
for
it.
as
i
recall
that
story
up
litigation,
i've
never
heard
of
an
indictment
for
it.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well
of
course
that
question
mr.
chief
justice
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
it
goes
to
very
heart
of
the
case.
now
of
course,
i'm
in
such
thorough
disagreement
with
my
worthy
advisory
here,
that
i
wouldn't
know
where
to
begin
to
answer
him.
i
disagree
with
him
on
the
facts,
on
the
law,
on
jurisdiction,
on
the
precise
questions
to
be
determined
here
are
not
everything.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
have
a
real
package
in
order
to
answer
my
opponent
and
that
comes
down
to
answering
the
question
of
the
chief
justice.
but
justice
harlan
asked
my
opponent
a
little
while
ago
about
whether
this
was
the
substandard
procedure
and
my
friend
said
in
a
few
cases.
well
i
can
think
off
hand
of
about
nine
or
ten
such
proceedings,
that
before
i
got
into
this
one,
frankly
two
years
ago
i
had
nothing,
never
had
anything
to
do
with
a
disciplinary
proceeding
and
had
no
idea
what
this
was
all
about.
i
looked
at
the
precedents
and
i
found
them
in
kings
county
and
queens
county
and
westchester
county
and
nassau
county,
in
new
york
county,
presiding
justice
botine,
i
think
it
was
in
1940
as
an
assistant
district
attorney
had
conducted
just
such
a
proceeding
as
this.
there
were
proceedings
all
over
the
state,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
particular
matter
is
being
watched
with
great
interest,
because
there
is
one
about
to
be
launched
in
nassau
county
on
long
island
and
they
have
been
in
constant
touch
with
me
from
buffalo
from
the
fourth
department
that
they're
thinking
of
an
investigation
up
there.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well
the
appellate
division
put
that
in
the
matter
of
anonymous
case
as
a
matter
of
this
discretion.
personally
my
own
view
is
that
there
he
was
according
that
he
would
be
according
the
witness
of
privilege,
that
the
witness
would
have
no
right
to
it
strictly.
in
other
words
–
in
other
words,
i
take
the
position
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes.
now
as
to
the
other
question
i
was
coming
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
but
as
i
read
it,
and
it's
a
matter
of
practice,
it's
not
mandatory.
that
didn't
to
be
in
the
order.
it
doesn't
need
to
be
conducted
in
private
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
very
first
case
that
i
referred
to
before,
association
of
the
bar,
the
city
of
new
york
in
222
appellate
division
and
that's
the
case
the
investigation
where
this
matter
of
karlan
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
there,
there
was
no
privacy.
there
was
nothing
in
the
order
about
conducting
it
in
camera
or
in
secret.
so
what
judge
wasable
did
there,
and
i
think
very
wisely,
when
an
attorney
was
called
in
and
was
to
testify,
judge
wasable,
who
said
counselor,
your
conduct
is
going
to
be
looked
into
here,
we're
going
to
inquire
about
all
these
negligence
cases
you
have,
do
you
want
a
public
hearing
or
do
you
want
it
in
private?
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
he
gave
them
an
option,
and
if
they
took
the
option,
whichever
option
they
took
that
was
it.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
that's
in
the
karlan
matter.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no
here
the
appellate
division
directed
in
its
order
that
it
be
conducted
in
private.
now
to
come
to
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
am
your
honor
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well
i
don't
think
so
for
this
reason,
this
was
a
summary
contempt,
criminal
contempt
as
we
call
it
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
justice.
everything
had
happened
before
judge
arkwright
and
what
i
was
going
to
come
to,
except
that
it's
been
taking
so
much
time
to
get
across
the
statutory
provisions
in
the
order,
is
that
the
time
factor
here
was
--
is
i
think
of
vital
consideration.
the
interesting
thing
here
is
that
these
witnesses
were
first
called
in
as
witnesses
on
december
4,
1957
they
were
called
in.
and
on
the
plea
of
their
attorney,
there
was
different
counsel
at
the
special
time,
the
matter
was
adjourned,
that
testimony
was
adjourned,
pending
this
appeal
in
matter
of
anonymous,
which
was
then
pending
in
the
appellate
division.
now
the
--
that
was
an
unrelated
matter
to
this
particular
situation
except
on
the
sense
it
arose
out
of
this
inquiry
and
m.
anonymous
involved
an
attorney.
now
my
friend
says
it's
--
his
case
is
so
different
and
the
appellate
division
didn't
find
itself.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
so
much
criminality
in
the
m.
anonymous
case
that
he
was
later
indicated
by
the
grand
jury
in
king's
county
and
tried
in
the
county
court.
but
on
that
day
december
24
--
december
4th
there
was
the
attorney
for
the
appellants
who
in
the
presence
of
the
appellants
walked
up
to
my
assistant
counsel
as
soon
as
they
got
the
adjournment
and
came
out
of
the
courtroom,
and
these
were
his
words
according
to
the
record,
counsel
for
the
appellants
wanted
to
know
from
my
assistant
exactly
what
was
wanted
of
his
clients
in
this
matter.
and
then
it
was
that
my
assistant
without
any
previous
authorization
or
consultation
with
me
or
the
judge
or
anybody
else
off
the
record
and
as
a
favor
to
them,
for
which
he
was
thanked,
gave
his
views
as
to
what
evidence
we
had
available
that
are
concerning
them
and
there
was
his
language
that's
been
quoted
in
both
briefs
about
a
sufficient
evidence
to
present
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
your
honor,
if
your
honor
please
it
was
a
truth
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes,
well
it
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
it
was
his,
it
was
his
opinion,
it
was
his
opinion
of
what
the
evidence
that
we
had
available
at
that
moment
would
show.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh
no.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
the
only,
the
only
point
that
i
make
with
reference
to
it
is
that
when
my
assistant
said
and
this
was
his
view,
he
told
it
preliminarily--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
this
is
--
i
am
picking
up
my
adversary's
brief,
he's
got
it
quoted
at
page
89.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
record
115.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
the
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
in
that
connection
is
where
my
assistant
said
first
he
talked
about
the
fact
that
we
were
interested
primarily
in
attorneys,
we
were
looking
into
the
conduct
of
attorneys.
and
he
wanted
to
know
whether
these
young
men,
licensed
private
detectives,
whether
they
had
taken
these
statements,
for
what
attorney's
statements
were
taken,
and
whether
the
tampering
was
done
by
them
or
their
employees
or
at
the
direction
of
some
attorney.
so
that
he
was
indicating
that
we
were
primarily
interested
in
lawyers
and
what
lawyers
did.
then
he
goes
on
and
he
says
i
further
stated
that
in
my
opinion
there
was
prima
facie
evidence
in
the
event
that
the
clients
decided
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment
to
refer
this
matter
to
the
district
attorney.
now
my
friend
in
this
court
and
courts
below
and
the
other
attorney
for
these
appellants
in
the
courts
below
say
that
that
was
a
threat
of
prosecution
by
the
district
attorney.
well
i
think
if
you
study
that
language
carefully
and
honestly
this
is
what
i
believe
my
assistant
had
in
mind
since
we
were
concerned
with
the
conduct
of
these
attorneys.
i
further
stated
in
my
opinion
it
was
prima
facie
evidence
in
the
event
the
clients
decided
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment
invoked
their,
rather
than
it
should
have
been
the
new
yorker
constitution,
but
to
invoke
that
constitutional
privilege
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
district
attorney
for
prosecution,
i
don't
think
so.
we
wanted
these
men
to
talk
and
i
think
that
that
language
is
far
more
susceptible.
though
i
am
going
to
take,
i
am
going
to
take
for
granted
in
this
argument
what
my,
what
my
adversary
says
it
means
but
i
think
it's
far
more
susceptible
of
the
proposition
that
these
young
men
would
probably
say
to
the
district
attorney
in
order
to
obtain
immunity
from
prosecution
rather
than,
rather
than
they
were
going
to
be
sent
there
to
be
convicted
for
crime,
because
that
wouldn't
do
our
inquiry
any
good.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
your
honor
please,
the
point
where
i
say
that
favor
was
involved,
is
that
my
assistant
talked
at
all.
he
had
a
--
he
had
this
lawyer
zangara
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
he
had
zangara
their
lawyer
and
these
two
appellants,
these
two
licensed
private
detectives,
who
--
who
were
so
fearful
of
what
might
happen
that
that
--
that
the
reason
they
ultimately
said
that
they
wouldn't
testify
without
the
presence
of
counsel
after
the
court
and
i
had
repeatedly
told
them
the
matter
had
been
decided
by
the
appellate
division
and
leave
to
appeal
had
been
denied
in
the
court
of
appeals,
one
of
these
young
man
said,
this
to
the
court,
the
court
if
you
wish
to
go
out
i
will
suspend
for
a
few
minutes
and
let
you
go
out
and
here
is
the
answer
of
this
witness,
the
witness,
no
your
honor
because
i
understand
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
not
ruled
on
it
yet.
now
these
were
not
ignorant
layman
as
my
friend
would
have
you
believe.
he
is
a
licensed
private
detective
and
they
are
also
insurance
brokers.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i'd
like
to
come
to
that
your
honor
--
your
honor
please
i
really
think
that
that's
what
that's
what
they
are
concerned
about
that
if
they
pleaded,
they
maybe
in
trouble
with
the
state
of
new
york
on
their
licenses.
they
don't
want
to
plead
it
and
this
is
the
device
that
they
are
using
to
avoid
having
to
plead.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
beg
your
honors
pardon.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well
i
think
i
don't
--
i
haven't
got
the
specific
case
in
mind
if
your
honor
please
as
to
what
the
licensing
department
would
do
here,
but
i
am
sure
there
would
be
a
very
serious
question
if
a
young
man
comes
in
to
be
a
licensed
private
detective
that
he
certainly
got
to
answer
any
proper
questions
that
the
authorities
would
put
to
him.
i
don't
say
it's
strictly
analogous
with
this
court's
recent
decision
in
lerner
against
casey
and
in
the
matter
of
the
philadelphia
school
teacher,
but
i
would
say
if
they
are
asking
for
the
privilege
of
a
license
from
the
state
of
new
york,
they
certainly
got
to
answer
any
questions
that
the
authority
wants
to
put
to
them.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
and
still
wanting
to
remain
on
the
police
force,
i
think
it's
the
same
thing.
may
i
say
this
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well
of
course
it's
not
strictly
on
that
ground
your
honor.
it's
refusing
to
answer
the
questions
of
his
superior
and
to
answer
them
with
candor.
i
think
that's
going
to
be,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
probably
going
to
be
one
the
problems
that
we
have
in
this
case,
with
all
of
the
attorneys
claiming
their
privilege
here.
it's
going
to
be
the
same
sort
of
thing.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes.
may
i
just
in
answer
to
that
question
paraphrase
or
reword
the
question
as
i
see
it
that's
before
this
court
and
this
will
sum
up
everything
i
think.
in
other
words,
the
question
as
i
see
it
is
do
these
appellants,
as
mere
witnesses,
have
a
constitutional
right
to
the
presence
of
their
counsel
in
the
hearing
room
in
what
has
been
called
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
quasi
administrative
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the
appellate
division
could
have
conducted
this
investigation
itself
and
judge
arkwright
and
now
judge
baker
is
merely
the
nominee
of
the
appellate
division
and
i
am
assisting
the
judges.
it's
a
quasi
administrative
in
that
sense.
it's
non-adversary.
it's
non
accusatory,
it's
non-prosecutorial
and
it's
a
preliminary
fact
finding
inquiry
that
doesn't
end
in
any
judgment
or
decree
and
establishes
the
rights
of
no
persons
whatsoever.
now
i
would
like,
i
don't
know
whether
i
got
time.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
now
that's
the
question,
on
the
merits
as
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i'd
like
to
give
you
a
three
fold
answer
in
capsule
form,
one
we
rely
upon
the
decisional
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
to
the
right
of
a
witness
to
counsel
which
has
remained
unchallenged
for
73
years.
i
am
going
back
to
a
case
that
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
1885
and
the
right
of
a
witness
to
counsel
didn't
come
up
again,
until
came
up
in
this
proceeding
in
matter
of
anonymous.
that
is
73
years
unchallenged
in
the
state
of
new
york
till
it
was
challenged
in
matter
of
anonymous
and
now
here
again.
we
rely
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
matter
of
groban,
decided
two
years
ago.
and
thirdly
i
don't
want
to
sit
down
without
saying
this
your
honors
that
we
rely
upon
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
expressed
by
the
people
through
their
legislatures
that
witnesses
in
such
an
inquiry
as
this
have
no
right
to
counsel.
in
the
back
of
my
brief,
in
the
back
of
my
brief
your
honors,
the
very
last
pages,
you
will
find
on
page
41
appendix
e,
the
civil
rights
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
there
on
page
41,
73
five
different
agencies
are
given,
are
defined
as
agencies
where
a
witness
is
given
the
limited
or
restricted
right
to
be
accompanied
by
counsel
and
then
judicial
inquiries
were
not
included
there.
that
was
in
54.
so
in
1958,
a
bill
was
introduced
which
i
have
set
forth
in
the
last
two
pages
of
my
brief
page
43
and
44.
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
legislature
in
new
york
to
amend
the
civil
rights
law
in
relation
to
the
right
of
representation
by
counsel
of
persons
called
as
witnesses
in
certain
inquires
and
investigations.
that
bill
would
have
answered
this
case
and
would
have
answered
the
contention
of
my
opponent,
because
it
doesn't
allow,
even
the
bill
doesn't
allow
in
a
judicial
inquiry
or
another
investigation,
it
doesn't
allow
witnesses
in
blanket
form,
every
witness,
the
right
to
counsel
but
only
witnesses
whose
testimony,
and
i
am
reading
from
the
bill,
may
tend
to
involve
himself
or
other
persons
in
any
subsequent
criminal
or
quasi
criminal
prosecution.
i
submit
that
on
that
basis
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
that
bill
was
not
enacted
your
honor,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
say
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
having
enacted
the
civil
rights
law
and
having
granted
in
five
different
investigations
by
five
different
agencies,
the
right
to
counsel
to
witnesses
in
limited
form,
then
when
the,
the
assemblymen
came
along
and
introduced
the
measure
that
would
have
amended
that
and
allowed
counsel
in
a
judicial
inquiry
under
certain
circumstances
and
that
failed
a
passage
that
this
matter
is
very
much
of
a
great
concern
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
through
their
legislators.
and
i
submit
that
as
a
proposition
of
whether
with
that
consideration
going
on
in
the
state
of
new
york,
this
court
should
intervene
or
interfere
and
overrule
and
predetermine
for
the
people
what
has
been
decided
now
as
a
matter
of
policy.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
since
it
started
your
honor,
since
january
1957.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
your
honor
please
quickly
we
had
2500
witnesses
up
to
the
time
we
called
these
witnesses
in.
we
examined
2500
witnesses
in
private.
this
is
an
immense
proposition
and
i
have
set
forth
more
pertinent
parts
of
judge
arkwright's
report
on
page
33
of
my
brief.
just
think
your
honors
in
--
between
53
and
57,
122933
statements
have
retainer
filed
in
kings
county,
how
can
we
possibly
even
spot
check
that
number,
but
we
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
what
–
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
most
of
the
–
most
of
the
witnesses,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
say,
i
would
say
one
to
four,
or
one
to
five,
in
other
words
every
witness
--
if
we
call
five
witnesses,
it
would
be
one
lawyer
in
the
five.
in
other
words,
we
have
to
call
in
plaintiffs
and
claimants,
and
doctors,
and
police,
and
labor
delegates
and
so
forth.
i
suggest
this
to
your
honors
that
of
these
witnesses,
we
examined
726
in
court
up
to
june
11th,
by
the
time
that
this
matter
broke
and
if
witnesses
were
allowed
--
counsel
was
allowed
for
witnesses
in
these
100s
of
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
groban
case,
that
we
have
--
to
say
that
there
would
be
delay,
that
this
would
be
cumbersome,
that
this
would
be
unwieldy,
and
add
unduly
to
the
cost
of
this
well.
i
just
don't
see
any
possibility
of
our
ever
getting
through
and
i
might
suggest
to
your
honors
that
up
to
this
very
moment,
the
expenses
have
run
over
$200,000
a
year
where
--
the
city
of
new
york
has
paid
over
$400,000
to
date
and
if
witnesses
were
allowed
counsel,
it
would
just
make
it
that
much
more
cumbersome
and
make
just
that
much
more
delay
and
i
don't
know
when
we
have
to
get
through
with
the
investigation.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well,
that's
very
difficult
to
say.
i'd
say
before
we
get
through
we
have
got
--
if
we
only
examine
into
lawyers
who
filed
say
a
100
statements
of
retainer
a
year,
now
that's
about
a
two
a
week
allowing
two
weeks
of
vacation
and
we
file
a
prima
facie,
lawyers
just
do
not
get
two
cases
a
weekly
legitimately.
if
the
appellate
division
goes
along
with
the
thinking
that
is
prima
facie
course
for
investigation,
for
inquiry.
we
call
them
up
and
say
how
did
you
get
a
100
--
how
do
you
get
two
cases
a
week.
the
law
firms
in
the
city
go
along
and
they
don't
get
ten,
they
don't
get
12,
they
don't
half
a
dozen
in
negligence
cases
and
these
lawyers
are
not
experts.
some
of
them
had
never
tried
a
case
in
their
lives.
they
are
settlers
and
what
this
investigation
as
judge
arkwright's
report
will
show,
what
the
y
are
actually
doing
is
they
are
conspiring
with
doctors,
with
collision
shop
and
with
others
all
--
and
then
they
bribe
the
man
in
the
insurance
company
so
that
it
is
all
coming
around
to
get
to
these
golden
reserves
of
the
insurance
companies.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
can
readily
understand
that
your
honor.
now
my
friend
in
concluding
says
that
with
the
last
place
that
–
of
all
places
the
witness
was
--
should
have
the
right
to
counsel
in
before
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
before
a
court.
i
take
this
as
a
contrary
view.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
last
place
where
a
witness,
a
lay
witness
particularly
should
need
counsel
is
in
before
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
i
say
that
on
this
basis
that
i
conceive
it
to
be
the
duty
of
a
justice
of
the
court,
and
i
know
that
judges
always
exercise
it
persistently
in
every
case
that
i
ever
heard
of,
they
turn
around
and
protect
the
witnesses
the
minute
the
witness
is
beginning
to
get
into
danger.
i
regard
that
as
a
duty
of
the
judge
to
look,
to
see
to
it
that
the
witnesses
are
fully
protected.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
don't
see
any
difference
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no
your
honor.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
would
say
so.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
no,
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think,
i
certainly
wouldn't
make
any
presumptions
as
to
it
or
i
presume
that
any
such
thing.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well,
i
certainly
think
you
can
decide
it
in
this
case
judge
black
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
you
have
got
a
complete
record
here
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
every
word
taken
down
by
an
official
reporter
there
isn't
a
thing
that
happened
in
this
case
that
isn't
contained
in
this
record.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
every
word
of
it.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
well,
so
far
as
this
--
that's
true,
and
i
am
not
going
to
talk
too
much
because
i
haven't
got
time
now,
but
i
wouldn't
have
too
much
time
to
talk
about
jurisdiction.
i
think
your
honors
will
look
in
vain
through
subdivision
10,
the
statute
he
attacks
to
find
anything
about
depravation
of
right
of
counsel.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
statute.
so
he
takes
it
direct
appeal
on
the
theory
that
this
statute
--
he
is
claiming
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
he
is
claiming
it
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
there
is
no
word
and
he
is
so
conceded
here
there
isn't
word
in
this
record
at
the
additional
special
term,
the
appellate
division,
the
court
of
appeals
anywhere
that
he
ever
claimed
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
there
isn't
a
word
in
it
that
deprives
a
witness
of
the
right
to
counsel.
i
submit
your
honor
that
both
on
jurisdiction
and
on
the
merits
we
should
prevail.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
would
say
it
would
be
appellate
division
--
if
the
appellate
division
would
release
it
and
as
a
matter
of
act
i
have
put
in
my
brief
as
appendix
c
the
report
of
mr.
justice
arkwright
that
was
right
up-to-date
at
the
time
this
thing
happened.
this
came
about
in
april,
the
examinations
were
in
april
and
these
young
men
were
held
in
contempt
and
judge
arkwright
report
was
dated
june
the
11th,
published
june
23--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
now
he
is
talking
about
a
report
that
was
just
made
the
end
of
the
year
while
all
this
was
going
on,
it
would
certainly
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
all
reports
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
oh!
no
we
just
report
to
the
appellate
division.
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
and
the
appellate
division
that
--
mr.
denis
m.
hurley
i
shall
take
that
to
the
appellate
division.
