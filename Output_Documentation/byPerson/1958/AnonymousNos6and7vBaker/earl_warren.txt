chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weissman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
order
gave
the
judge
the
discretion
of
either
permitting
counsel
or
keeping
counsel
out,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
does
that
refer
back
to
any
language
in
any
statute?
is
there
any
statute
that
gives
the
right
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
it
is
not
in
the
order
itself,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
may
i
ask
this
as
a
matter
of
interest?
was
there
any
discretion
used
prior
to
your
case
that
you
know
in
excluding
or
admitting
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hurley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hurley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
under
this
order,
that
you
have
just
been
reading,
did
the
judge
have
the
authority
to
grant
immunity
to
any
witness
who
might
come
before
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
did
that
was
the
question
i
--
that
is
the
question
i
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
claiming
that
it
would
incriminate
him,
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
not
exactly
what
i
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
what
i
am
getting
at
is
this,
suppose
there
was
this
in
the
proceeding
and
nothing
else?
witness
was
asked
a
question
and
he
said,
judge
if
i
answer
any
questions
i
demand
immunity,
what
would
happen
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
suppose
it
ended
right
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right
suppose
it
ended
right
there,
what
would
happen
insofar
as
the
witness
was
concerned,
what
would
happen
then?
would
you
proceed
or
would
you
dismiss
the
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
proceed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
you
would
not
recognize
his
demand
that
if
he
testifies,
he
is
entitled
to
immunity,
you
would
compel
him
to
go
further
and
claim
his
privilege
against
incrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
that
too.
the
only
thing
i
understood
a
little
while
ago
from
the
question
that
if
he
had
just
walked
in
there
and
had
demanded
immunity
and
nothing
else,
he
could
have
been
excused
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
justice
frankfurter
you
and
i
are
not
in
disagreement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
can't
do
that
in
any
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
while
that
matter
is
true,
why
--
why
did
they
ask
16
questions
in
one
case
and
24
in
another
before
the
witness
is
excused
or
before
a
general
question
was
about
--
concerning
his
refusal
to
testify
was
given,
why
24
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
left
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
let
more
than
one
person
interrogate
the
witness
in
those
proceedings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
barratry
–
is
barratry
an
indictable
offense
in
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
appeal
to
me
mr.
hurley.
if
you
bring
--
if
in
these
investigations,
you
bring
a
witness
before
the
judge
with
the
idea
in
mind
of
making
findings
against
him,
accusing
him
either
of
criminal
offense
or
some
professional
offense,
and
if
that
record,
with
those
findings
is
to
be
given
to
the
lawyer
who
prosecutes
this
man
while
he
is
on
the
witness
stand,
why
in
reason
shouldn't
that
man
be
entitled
to
have
someone
present
in
court
to
represent
him,
while
this
proceeding
is
going
on?
if
you
are
to
make
a
finding
that
may
even
result
in
his
going
to
jail
or
in
destroying
his
professional
reputation,
isn't
it
consistent
with
due
process
and
legal
proceedings
of
all
kinds
to
give
that
man
an
opportunity
to
be
represented
by
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
if
you
can't
answer
that
question
that
i
asked
you,
would
you
mind
answering
this
one?
does
the
judge
have
the
power
to
determine
whether
counsel
can
be
permitted
to
enter
or
whether
he
shall
be
kept
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
the
discretion
then
to
either
admit
them
or
reject
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
all
i
ask.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
not
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
truthful,
the
statement
that
he
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
said
it
was
without
authorization
and
so
forth
and
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wanted
--
is
it
--
you
take
it
as
truth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
his
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
115,
yes
i
have
it
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
at
the
beginning
of
his
answers
is
a
little
more
cryptic
and
a
little
more
challenging
than
you
suggest
what
you
have
read.
his
answer
was,
my
recollection
of
the
facts
as
they
took
place
on
december
4th
was
that
following
mr.
zangara,
this
is
on
top
of
page
115,
was
that
following
mr.
zangara
being
before
the
court
and
asking
for
an
adjournment
that
he
and
his
clients
approached
me
in
the
outer
foyer
outside
the
courtroom
and
mr.
zangara
as
spokesman
for
the
group,
asked
me
exactly
what
was
wanted
of
his
clients
in
this
matter.
i,
at
that
time,
told
mr.
zangara
that
all,
i
don't
know
my
exact
language,
but
i
indicated
that
we
did
not
intend
to
pussyfoot
with
them.
now
that's
pretty
--
that's
rather
strong
language
it
seems
to
me
if
taken
together
with
the
rest
of
it.
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
just
i'll
do
you
a
favor
and
i'll
be
glad
to
tell
you
what
to,
what
we
have
got
here
and
so
forth
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
should
have
had
counsel
too
and
talk
with
these
people
outside
of
the
court
room.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
my
question
and
that's
going
to
be
your
question
and
i
don't
--
you
are
right
to
answer
it
your
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
that
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
bill
enacted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
its
relevance
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
suppose
if
there
are
four
lay
witness
who
run
for
the
lawyers
that
the
numbers,
the
numbers
that
you
gave
us
isn't
the
sort
of
materials
might
otherwise
be,
because
i
suppose
most
of
those
and
a
great
many
of
them
are
voluntary
witnesses
who
would
have
no
case
and
have
a
lawyer
who
were
not
under
investigation,
but
how
many
people
are
potential
defendants
among
those
that
you
examined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
sure
you
realize
mr.
hurley
that
no
one
on
this
court
would
be
out
of
sympathy
with
an
investigation
of
such
matters
because
they
have
been
involved
with
some
experience
with
that
situation,
and
what
we're
interested
in
only
is
whether
the
individual
who
is
called
before
a
secret
investigation
at
that
time
has
his
federal
rights
protected
under
the
constitution,
and
that's
what
these
questions
at
least
i
have
asked
are
directed
to
them
(inaudible)
sympathy
investigation
of
this
kind
to
determine
what
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
whatever
time
you
have
left
the
record
show
you
have
one
minute,
but
you
may
have
your
one
minute,
whatever
the
time
is,
you
want
to
take
it
right
now,
you
may
or
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hurley
is
that
report
–
would
that
report
will
be
available
to
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
are
available
it
might
be
helpful
otherwise
not
–
