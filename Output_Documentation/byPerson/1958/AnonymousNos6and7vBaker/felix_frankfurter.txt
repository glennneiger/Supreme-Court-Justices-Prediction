justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
hear
correctly
that
do
you
think
the
companion
case
anonymous
m
was
a
different
case
from
your
case
and
did
not
govern
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought,
read
it
actually
somewhere
that
you
indicated
the
circumstances
in
the
companion
case,
anonymous
m,
were
different
from
circumstances
in
this
case,
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
this
case,
your
claim
is
that
he
is
not
merely
a
witness
as
to
the
conduct
of
others
but
potentially
he
himself
was
or
the
defendant
or
may,
may
become
a
defendant
that
was
not
true
in
the
companion
case,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
you
say
the
misconception,
it
wasn't
misconception,
the
appellate
division
to
find
anonymous
m
controlling
from
which
i
draw
the
inference,
you
tell
me
if
it
were
just
as
i
believe
that
the
statute
as
such
does
not
--
does
not
violate
or
offend
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
application
made
of
it
to
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case
which
you
are
arguing,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
true
of
every
statute
which
is
as
it
were
arbitrarily
applied
to
a
particular
situation
makes
them
appeal
although
the
statute
continues
to
stand,
continues
to
be
enforceable
and
tomorrow
after
the
effects
of
decision
it
just
as
operated
as
it
was
the
day
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
becomes
then,
the
underlying
basis
of
the
action
of,
what
this
judge
authorized
was
this
order
to
investigate
ambulance
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
gave
him
his
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
is
the
real,
the
real
offence
here
is
whether
under
that
order
he
could
do
what
is
denied
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
the
order
accorded
at
a
special
term
--
set
forth
that
in
order
to
protect
the
innocent
people
he
may
exclusively
hold
the
hearings
in
camera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
because
if
flowed
from
that
order,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
appellant
claim
immunity
under
the
new
york
constitution?
did
they
refuse,
did
they
object
to
the
whole
inquiry
and
not
merely
decide
a
counsel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
invoke
the
state
constitution
of
immunity,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
contest
against
the
constitutionality
of
the
proceeding
in
its
entirely?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
which
validated
this
proceeding
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
proceeding
(inaudible)
the
appellate
division
into
a
generally
inquiry
(inaudible)
and
they
have
to
recognize
that,
unless
i'm
wrong
about
it,
that
such
procedure,
such
inquiry
maybe
had
either
in
camera
or
public,
and
in
camera
in
order
to
protect
its
people,
this
is
in
the
very
words
of
the
order,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
suggesting
it,
i'm
suggesting
that
this
inquiry
has
been
(inaudible)
in
chief
justice
cardozo's
opinion
(inaudible)
just
for
the
proceeding
by
the
appellate
division.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
have
stopped
this
whole
inquiry
couldn't
he
by
saying
i'm
a
potential
criminal
defendant
and
thereby
don't
propose
to
answer
these
questions,
could
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
that
be
difficult?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
was
the
judge
of
the
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
he
never
claimed
immunity
which
he
can
invoke
under
the
new
york
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
before
a
man
who
was
sitting
in
special
term
as
a
supreme
court
judge
in
brooklyn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
he,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
a
crime
and
not
be
entitled
to
the
defense
of
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
he
has
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
go
out
in
the
hall
and
consult
his
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
could
tell
him
don't
answer
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weissman
but
your
case
here
if
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
finds
great
support
from
the
fact
that
a
member
of
the
staff
told
him
we
are
not
going
to
pussyfoot
with
you,
you
could
have
reported
that.
that's
not
a
clumsy
problem.
even
the
layman
in
this
business
would
understand
that,
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
indeed
your
claim
is
that
that
would
make
your
case
different
from
anonymous
m?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
but
the
question
is
whether
it
violates
the
federal
constitution,
whether
–
that
he
wasn't
allowed
to
have
a
lawyer
in
although
he
could
have
protected
himself
(inaudible)
by
not
having
him
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
in
the
interest
of
accuracy,
i
suppose
your
brother
would
tell
us,
but
isn't
this
like
the
many
instances
to
which
chief
judge
cardozo
referred
where
the
whole
proceeding
is
initiated
by
a
bar
association,
it
makes
the
petitions
to
the
appellate
division
and
the
appellate
division
then
decides
whether
the
representations
are
of
sufficient
gravity
to
call
for
an
inquiry
and
when
it
finds
a
sufficient
gravity
as
it
did
in
the
karlin
case,
it
then
designates
a
special
justice
of
the
supreme
court
to
sit
in
as
the
hearing
master,
a
report
to
it,
and
the
hearing
master
(inaudible)
supreme
court
of
either
the
first
division
or
the
second
or
any
of
the
other
four
divisions
in
new
york,
is
then
assisted
by
a
lawyer
designated
by
the
petition
in
bar
association,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
would
have
to
claim
it,
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
immunity
if
it
justifies
or
must
he
--
maybe
--
must
he
respect
a
claim
of
immunity
against
self
incrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
probably
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
be
clear
of
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
witness
claimed
privilege
to
keep
quiet
at
an
end
of
the
inquiry
that
mr.
justice
arkwright
–
justice
confronted
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
he
is
not
given
because
the
grant
of
immunity
for
prosecution
is
something
else
which
in
new
york
and
other
state
is
carefully
guarded
as
to
who
can
be
given
and
who
can't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
witness
had
claimed
privilege
not
to
testify,
that
would
have
been
at
the
end
of
inquiry
as
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
hurley
nobody
can
claim
immunity
from
prosecution
merely
by
asking
for
it.
he
can
only
claim
that
in
answer
to
or
as
an
equivalent
to
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
witness
can
say
your
honor;
i
want
immunity
before
i
talk.
well,
the
judge
says
what
are
you
claiming
immunity
for,
immunity
from
prosecution?
you
can't
claim
immunity
for
prosecution
unless
you
claim
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can't
do
that
before
a
regular
court,
mr.
hurley,
can
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
as
a
matter,
can
we
ask
you
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
arkwright
or
any
other
judges
in
new
york
allow
you
to
go
on
and
put
substantially
the
same
question
which
to
his
mind
is
clearly
relevant
to
the
claim
of
the
privilege
forever
for
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
interested
me
as
an
old
new
yorker
in
saying
that
the
district
attorney
begins
--
conduct
disciplinary
proceedings
and
(inaudible)
new
york.--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
new
york
on
the
mechanism
of
the
bar
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
also
have
to
balance
a
budget,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
also
have
to
balance
a
budget.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
potential
offenses,
the
potential
that
may
arise
out
of
your
investigation
are
not
so
petty
and
casual
that
they
do
not
require
a
grand
jury
proceedings,
do
they?
the
order
must
require
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
district
attorney
must
make
submissions
to
grand
jury
to
get
an
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
meant
these
are
not
--
i'm
not
asking
of
that
order,
if
there
is
a
case,
it's
an
important
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
a
package
too
haven't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
cardozo
request
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
record
at
115?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
ever
heard
claiming
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
these
detectives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
analogous
to
the
case
of
a
policeman
claiming
a
privilege
and
still
wanting
to
be
a
policeman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hurley
your
time
is
–
running
on
the
new
york
time
and
i
hope
you
can
come
in
back
with
chief
justice's
question,
which
you
say
that
heart
of
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
hurley
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
have
you
been
stating
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
regard
to
be
the
practical
difference
if
every
witness
is
summoned
before
in
this
enquiry
to
bring
his
lawyer
along.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
practice
the
witness
says
your
honor
i
would
like
to
go
outside
and
talk
to
my
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
request
be
granted
in
the
matter
of
course?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
granted
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
his
enquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
difference
really
unless
he'd
say
not
only
would
he
have
a
--
unless
the
claim
is
and
i
haven't
heard
him
say
that
not
only
may
he
have
counsel
sitting
next
to
him,
but
counsel
may
not
merely
--
he
may
not
merely
be
entitled
to
have
the
advice
of
his
client
–
of
his
counsel
but
he
may
have
the
right
of
examination
through
his
client,
what
difference
is
there
between
going
out
when
he
wants
to
(inaudible)
than
having
him
sit
next
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weissman
claimed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weissman
claimed
that
he
can
come
here
on
appeal
on
the
basis
of
how
this
statute
was
construed
in
his
client's
case,
not
in
some
abstract
client
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
earlier
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
all
the
reports
made
for
the
appellate
division?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
are
not
made
directly
the
kings
–
mr.
silver,
the
kings
county
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
can
do
what
they
please
with
it.
