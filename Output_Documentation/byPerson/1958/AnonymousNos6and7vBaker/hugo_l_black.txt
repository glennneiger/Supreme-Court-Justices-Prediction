well,
i
mean
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
assistants
to
the
judge
--
the
special
prosecutor,
is
that
(inaudible)
in
when
the
judge
makes
the
report
to
the
district
attorney?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
you,
the
only
ones
present
for
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
special
prosecutor,
special

justice
hugo
l.
black
the

justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
witness
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
other
officials
there,
are

l.
black
you
were
inside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
you
permitted
to
stay
inside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
another
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
charge
here
is
based
solely
on
the
practices
that
he
declined
to
testify
without
telling
his
lawyer
there
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
occurred
here,
did
the
bar
association
name
the
(inaudible)
special
judge
or
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
lawyer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
have
to
claim
immunity
and
he
would
have
claim
privilege
on
each
question
that
was
asked
no
matter
how
many
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
be
in
there
without
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
do
you,
that
by
just
refusing
to
answer
the
first
question
on
the
ground
it
might
incriminate
him,
you
would
be
let
alone
until
you're
going
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
continue
to
ask
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
somewhat
like
it's
done
usually
when
a
witness
gets
on
the
stand
and
they
make
him
claim
his
privilege,
and
claim
his
privilege
and
keep
on
claiming
his
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
there
be
in
trouble
with
the
state
of
new
york
where
they
are
licensed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
they
be
in
trouble
with
the
state
of
new
york
with
their
licenses
if
they
claimed
the
constitutional
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
the
man
had,
he
is
not
allowed
to
have
a
lawyer
there,
apparently
he
can't
refuse
to
testify
on
that
ground
and
if
he
claimed
the
privilege,
he
would
be
denied
a
license,
to
continue
in
the
business,
if
he
claimed
the
constitutional
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
mr.
hurley
if
we
can
decide
this
case
as
to
the
principle
that's
before
us
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
you
with
your
idea
of
ethics
and
so
forth
will
let
a
lawyer
--
let
a
man
go
out
and
talk
to
your
lawyer,
does
the
law
require
that
he
be
granted
that
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
depend
entirely
on
the
judge
and
the
lawyers
who
are
conducting
the
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
all
judges
are
precisely
the
same
in
connection
with
their
treatment
of
witnesses
and
defendants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
convinced
that
you
wouldn't.
i
am
convinced
that
you
wouldn't,
but
we
can
go
on
the
basis
if
the
â€“
of
power
in
that
realm,
that
a
judge
and
the
prosecutor
can't
deny
the
right
even
to
go
to
see
their
counsel?
can
we
decide
the
case
on
the
basis,
within
the
instance
that
which
you
are
permitted,
you
have
permitted
that
to
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
