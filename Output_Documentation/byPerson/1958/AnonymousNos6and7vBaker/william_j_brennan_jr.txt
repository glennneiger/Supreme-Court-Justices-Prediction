justice
william
j.
brennan,

prosecution
on
information,
rather
that
on
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
might,
for
example
on
the
basis
of
testimony
taken
before
the
judge,
the
district
attorney
prosecute
by
information,

your
client
is

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
hurley
have
you
had
occasion
then
when
a
witness
has
answered
and
then
later
evoked
the
privilege
to
have
the
judge
rule
that
he
could
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
other
words
you
have
never
raised
with
the
judge
the
question
whether
in
fact
the
privilege
was
available
as
to
the
particular
question
to
the
witness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
your
name,
i
plead
the
â€“
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
have
you
ever
challenged
that
to
the
judge
at
that
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
regard
to
what
the
question
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
those
are
only
papers
related
to
admission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
there
mr.
hurley,
i
notice
that
the
order
makes
provision
for
findings
as
well
as
recommendations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
findings
include
the
for
example
some
finding
as
to
witness
or
does
findings
relate
only
to
findings
as
to
lawyers
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
does
this
mean
this
time
then
as
to
the
appellants
here,
there
might
be
finding
say
that
they
were
dropped
in
someway,
are
those
findings
under
section
10
might
be
released
at
the
discretion
of
the
appellate
division
even
though
they
may
never
have
been
prosecuted
for
the
crimes
suggested
by
the
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
said
for
a
criminal
investigation
did
i
correctly
understand
that
maybe
that
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
and
evidence
alone
there
could
be
a
prosecution
and
information
without
further
criminal
investigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
suppose
the
appellate
division
sends
as
you
say
the
package
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
hurley,
have
you
a
case
in
exercise
or
been
given
this
discretion
to
turned
over
to
the
district
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have
done
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
in
those
instances
where
you
have
done
it,
has
there
been
an
independent
criminal
investigation
or
have
there
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
so
if
it's
the
kind
of
offense
that
maybe
prosecuted
under
information
though?
