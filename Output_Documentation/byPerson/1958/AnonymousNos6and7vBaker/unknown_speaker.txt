unknown
speaker
i'm
putting
to
you
a
different
question,
i
cannot
conceive
it
is
possible
that
a
claim
of
a
immunity
may
before
a
judicial
proceeding,
such
as
this
was
is
not
subject
to
same
rights
of
a
claim
of
immunity
for
any
other
judicial,
and
he
could
have
stopped
this
whole
inquiry
by
saying,
i
am
a
potential
defendant,
or
i
may
turn
out
to
be
a
defendant
as
a
result
of
this
inquiry
and
therefore
i
don't
suppose
to
begin
answering
questions,
couldn't
he?
