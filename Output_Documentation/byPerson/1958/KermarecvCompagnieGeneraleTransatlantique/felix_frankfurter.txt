justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
was
that
--
please
inform
me.
it's
the
decision
of
this
court
that
--
that
common
law
doctrine
of
contributory
negligence
is
not
to
be
imported
on
to
the
laws
or
is
that
a
decision
in
which
the
course
of
action
was
for
negligence
or
was
it
where
the
course
of
action
was
for
unseaworthiness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
confusion,
you
mean
different
states
have
different
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
makes
a
difference
(inaudible)
whether
--
what
the
answer
to
justice
douglas'
question.
it's
less
confusing
to
find
the
--
whether
state
law
applies
or
doesn't.
if
state
law
applies,
new
york
law,
then
you
have
the
usual
problem
of
finding
out
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
call
confusion
is
no
more
of
confusion
than
the
--
than
different
shades
of
decisions
on
rightly
a
different
fact
from
this
court
and
offers
every
subject
to
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
a
very
different
problem
if
my
job,
as
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
to
be
able
to
state
with
my
conscience
and
my
mind
what
the
new
york
law
on
that
subject
is.
i
think
that
i
can
accomplish
that
feat.
if
i'm
asking
to
summarize
what
the
generalized
law
of
the
48
states,
that's
a
very
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
there's
a
different
problem
if
you
ask
us
and
in
a
way
you
should
or
should
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you'd
rather
not
that
we
should
decide
what
the
federal
law
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
made
out
of
false
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
put
in
an
appendix.
it
would
show
there's
another
way
of
doing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
put
in
that
appendix?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
another
way
of
doing
it,
if
may
say
so,
much
better
way,
i
believe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that's
not
--
it's
not
having
the
court
exorcise
all
the
past.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
new
york
law
governed,
there
would
be
liability
for
negligence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
your
statement
of
rewarding
a
person
with
negligent
that
means
--
cover
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
problem
really
is
whether
new
york
law
should
govern
or
whether
this
is
action
of
general
admiralty
law.
this
is
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
to
impose
all
restrictive
responsibility
on
the
shipowner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
was
addressing
myself
to
your
suggestion
that
not
to
allow
the
damage
of
recovery
would
be
doing
--
encourage
negligence.
that
isn't
the
question,
referring
to
by
the
new
york
law
(inaudible)
we
could
fashion
or
but
could
see
would
have
to
be
(inaudible)
fashioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
--
i
don't
know
what
the
facts
are
and
what
the
jury
found,
all
they
are
saying
is
that
you
can't
(inaudible)
negligence
to
them,
to
the
shipowner,
you
should
be
held
liable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
negligence
claim.
the
--
or
judge
hand's
case
in
the
galveston
illustrates
it
very
well,
doesn't
it?
the
father
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
it's
found
there
wasn't
any
(inaudible)
found
there
was
no
negligence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
a
guest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
because
the
vessel
was
moored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
it's
from
the
high
sea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i'm
not
talking
about
seaworthiness.
suppose
the
conditions
that
you
require
for
a
practice
for
--
for
the
coming
into
being
of
a
--
of
a
claim
for
negligence
on
the
high
seas,
would
it
be
a
common
law
negligence
or
would
it
be
his
option
by
admiralty
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
assuming
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
a
passenger
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
suit
--
a
trap
or
as
the
case
of
a
passenger
or
--
or
some
--
some
want
of
care
owing
to
the
passenger.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
it
occurred
at
the
--
on
a
high
sea.
was
that
--
following
justice
black's
question,
would
you
conceive
it?
would
that
be
the
enforcement
either
in
the
english
courts
or
ours
of
a
common
law
negligence
or
would
it
be
an
absorption
by
--
by
admiralty
--
of
admiralty
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
--
is
it
--
it
would
require
a
jury
trial
[laughs]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
would
require
a
jury
trial
if
it's
common
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
in
person
if
an
appropriate
agent
of
his,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
of
course.
i
mean
the
way
a
corporation
gets
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
you're
not
using
the
word
“trap”
in
any
technical
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
which
--
and
which
the
jury
may
find
constitute
what
the
alternative
called
negligence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
negligence
be
enough
if
--
if
acting
on
behalf
of
the
shipowner,
a
fellow
had
carelessly
in
--
in
putting
down
carelessly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
should
be
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
question
of
fact
which
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
general
principle.
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
on
whether
this
is
summoned
by
new
york
law
by
something
(inaudible)
