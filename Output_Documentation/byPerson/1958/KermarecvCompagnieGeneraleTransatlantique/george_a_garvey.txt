mr.
george
a.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
all
the
members
of
this
bench.
i
will
not
belabor
the
court
with
the
repetition
of
the
facts,
except
to
point
out
perhaps
two
or
three
things
that
were
not
referred
to.
it
was
--
i
don't
think
that
the
plaintiff
here,
the
petitioner
makes
any
contention
that
the
visit
to
this
vessel
was
solely
for
social
reason,
wholly
unrelated
to
the
business
of
the
defendant.
in
that,
the
injured
man,
a
native-born
frenchman
but
naturalized
and
united
states
citizen
wanted
to
bring
aboard
the
vessel
a
package
to
a
friend
who
was
a
steward
on
the
ship
and
who
in
turn
would
bring
that
package
to
france.
the
package
served
no
purpose
in
the
furtherance
of
the
--
of
the
ship's
business.
he
arrived
aboard
the
vessel
at
about
noon
on
the
--
over
the
gangway.
he
visited
in
the
--
in
his
friend's
room
until
between
4
and
5
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
there
was
some
drink
to
be
--
had
there
and
he
went
to
a
bar
too
for
purpose
of
having
a
drink.
at
about
5
o'clock,
he
admitted
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
leave
the
vessel.
and
he
took
a
stairway
of
whether
--
either
10
or
12
steps,
which
have
been
covered
by
what
is
known
as
ship's
canvas,
about
the
thickness
of
a
paper
match
cover,
or
perhaps
an
eight
of
an
inch
in
thickness.
and
customarily
that
--
that
cover,
or
one
like
it,
was
put
on
the
steps
while
the
ship
was
moored
in
new
york
harbor.
and
it
was
secured
by
tacks
which
ran
through
not
only
the
canvas,
but
also
the
rubber
covering
on
the
side,
on
the
thread
but
also
into
the
wood
beneath.
that
is
the
undisputed
testimony
.there
was
drawing
made
that
the
taking
of
the
deposition
i
have
the
exhibits
here,
if
the
court
decides
to
see
any
of
them,
i'd
be
very
glad
to
leave
them
here,
the
original
photographs,
the
drawing
and
--
and
so
forth.
now,
it
is
true
he
said
that
the
tacks
could
be
removed
by
lifting
the
--
the
canvas.
well,
i
--
i
think
we,
perhaps,
are
all
familiar
that
even
in
our
households
that
the
general
way
for
removing
a
carpet
from
any
stairway
is
not
by
screwdriver
or
--
or
a
hammer
but
generally,
you
can
lift
it
up
without
too
much
force.
that's
how
it
was
done
customarily.
this
--
cover
had
been
put
on
the
stairway
at
about
8
o'clock
that
morning.
some
nine
hours
had
gone
by
when
this
accident
happened.
the
man
who
laid
it
had
gone
up
and
down.
one
of
the
other
men,
a
man
by
the
name
of
dufy
had
used
it
at
least
eight
or
10
times
that
day.
when
the
accident
happened,
the
plaintiff
when
--
he
said
it
looked
all
right
to
him,
he
descended
to
four
steps
to
the
bottom
when
he
says
that
the
--
that
his
foot
slipped
or
the
canvas
slipped
under
his
foot.
it
so
happened
that
he
didn't
go
to
a
hospital
until
the
following
day.
and
then
in
the
history
on
the
hospital,
he
said
he
didn't
know
just
how
the
accident
did
happen.
but
he
said
that
the
only
step
even
now
--
even
while
he
looked
at
it
from
the
bottom
stairway
that
appeared
to
be
in
any
way
out
of
order
was
the
fourth
one,
all
the
other
steps
the
--
the
canvas
was
in
place.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
two
of
his
friends
or
one
of
his
friends
and
another
member
of
the
crew
went
down
that
same
stairway
immediately
after
the
accident
and
went
up
again
and
found
nothing
wrong
with
the
stairway.
now,
i
--
i
concede
that
there
has
been
no
clarification
at
the
level
of
this
court
as
to
the
status
of
a
person
such
as
--
since
a
man
was,
and
whether
or
not
he
is
entitled
to
the
rights
of
the
seaworthy
doctrine.
however,
i
do
feel
--
and
i'm
not
in
--
in
dispute
nor
do
i
in
any
way
voice
any
displeasure
with
the
laws
as
has
been
expressed
by
this
court
in
reference
to
longshoremen,
their
rights
of
the
--
of
the
seaworthy
doctrine
to
fully
recover
the
rights
that
a
member
of
the
crew
could,
nor
a
carpenter
who's
engaged
in
making
safe
the
ship,
or
anyone
else
who's
furthering
the
business
of
the
ship
because
they
are
all
exposed
to
the
hazards
that
the
--
that
the
seamen
themselves
who
had
been
in
--
in
other
days.
but
even
this
court
has
said
in
the
pope
&
talbot
case,
has
pointed
out
that
even
as
between
a
longshoreman
or
a
carpenter,
whatever
the
case
may
be,
that
he
does
not
have
all
the
rights
that
a
sea
--
that
--
that
a
member
of
the
crew
has.
it
was
pointed
out
by
this
court
that
he
is
limited
to
recovery
for
personal
injuries
and
for
a
pain
suffering,
for
loss
of
wages
but
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
right
of
maintenance
and
cure,
which
a
--
a
member
of
the
crew
has.
now,
there
is
a
distinction
and
this
court
recognized
it,
as
to
the
rights
and
the
limitation
of
the
rights
as
between
a
--
a
crew
member
and
someone
else
who
has
come
into
part
of
the
--
of
the
work
of
what
formerly
was
performed
by
a
member
of
the
crew.
now,
i
--
i
believe
that
this
is
not
a
maritime
tort.
i
think
it
comes
under
the
doctrine
of
common
law
rights
and
obligations.
and
if
that
is
so,
i
think
the
doctrine
as
applied
in
the
--
in
this
case
was
promptly
followed
by
the
court
in
its
decision.
i
think
that
the
relationship
here
was
that
of
a
--
a
social
visitor
who
has
no
right
of
recovery
except
where
there
is
a
hidden
trap
or
where
there's
wanton
or
willful
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
host,
with
whom
he
is
visiting
or
unless
this
is
an
affirmative
act
of
negligence
created
after
the
arrival
on
the
premises.
there
might
be
a
guest
on
your
--
in
your
stable
or
your
farm
or
whatever
it
might
be,
and
if
you
operate
a
normal
bill,
of
course,
that
will
be
one
form
of
affirmative
negligence.
well,
in
this
instance
here,
there
is
no
proof
that
there
was
anything
that
was
done
wrong
which
would
--
created
the
trap
for
the
honorary
person
such
as
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
hours
had
gone
by,
the
--
the
stairway
had
been
used
for
many
hours
by
several
people.
it
was
--
there
was
no
proof
that
there
was
anything
unusual
about
the
type
of
tack,
or
that
was
inadequate
or
that
it
had
not
served
this
purpose.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
proof
in
the
case
to
the
contrary,
that
was
the
kind
of
tack
that
was
customarily
used
in
--
of
tacking
down
the
--
the
canvas
on
the
ship
on
--
on
this
and
other
occasions.
now,
i
have
not
attempted,
your
honors,
as
it's
obvious
from
my
brief,
to
have
answered
all
of
the
citations
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
and
my
brief
would
have
been
much
longer
than
this
court
would
perhaps
have
the
patience
to
--
to
look
at.
essentially,
i
think
that
this
is
a
common
law
case
that
he
was
a
social
visitor
and
was
entitled
to
the
rights
as
defined
not
only
by
judge
lumbard
in
the
prevailing
majority
opinion
but
also
i'd
say
to
the
--
the
authorities
in
new
york,
because
i
believe
that
the
law
of
new
york
should
govern.
now,
that
--
those
reference
here
of
--
of
some
time
ago
by
one
of
the
justices
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
difference
between
one
person
and
another.
the
galveston
case
is
a
classic
example
of
it
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
and
which
a
--
a
writ
was
denied
by
this
court
and
the
--
on
the
rehearing,
it
was
also
denied.
and
it
was
pointed
out
there
that
the
father
who's
the
master
of
the
ship
could
recover
because
his
relationship
was
that
of
--
in
the
nature
of
crew
worker.
but
the
son
who
was
merely
a
social
visitor
was
not
entitled
to
recover.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
change
of
the
rights
as
defined
in
the
cases
that
have
come
and
--
before
the
courts
up
to
this
point,
if
there
is
to
be
a
change,
i
--
i
think
it
should
be
by
a
legislation
and
not
by
--
by
the
decision
of
this
court.
that
was
what
was
done
in
england.
apparently,
it
was
considered
over
there,
to
the
need
of
the
change
of
the
rights
owing
to
what
the
business
prestige
should
be
done
by
legislation.
very
briefly,
that's
my
position
and
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
pardon
me?
mr.
george
a.
garvey
i
said
if
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
if
there
was
a
hidden
danger
in
the
nature
of
a
trap.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
suppose
--
suppose
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
what?
pardon
me?
mr.
george
a.
garvey
it
--
it
would
be
a
tort.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
i
think
it'd
become
a
law
in
any
event
because
i
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
--
i
think
it
would
be
a
common
law.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
don't
see
why
it
would
be
anything
else
and
the
relationship
between
the
--
the
plaintiff
here
and
the
shipowner.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
--
that
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
--
well,
it
could
be
a
tort.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
yes.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
exactly
my
position.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
exactly
my
position.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
not
necessarily
because
it
was
moored.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
it
--
it
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
--
i
think
there
--
the
common
law
would
apply
and
i
don't
think
that
seaworthiness
has
been
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
--
i
would
have
to
conceive
that
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
there
because
--
i
mean
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
no,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
--i
appreciate
that.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
yes.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
don't
say
--
i
--
i
think
probably
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
that
it
could
not
be
limited
as
a
seaman
might
be
limited
to
an
admiralty
action.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
no,
your
honor,
unless
it
--
that
is
such
a
defect
that
it
amounts
to
a
trap
such
as
the
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
but
--
as
to
amount
to
a
trap.
but
for
a
structural
defect
in
itself,
there
is
no
responsibility
under
the
new
york
law
to
a
social
visitor
or
licensee.
and
i
have
collated
the
cases
at
pages
--
i've
cited
in
sum
of
--
on
pages
6,
7,
8
and
9.
all
of
which
uphold
that
proposition
which
i
have
just
stated,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
right.
all
--
on
--
on
a
trap
--
a
trap
situation.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
that
--
that's
--
amount
--
amounts
to
the
same
thing,
that's
one
lately.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
if
he
was
aware
of
--
of
all
those
things,
judge,
i
think
that
that
would
constituted
that.
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
to
it
that
would
support
that
situation.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
pardon
me?
mr.
george
a.
garvey
oh,
i
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
shipowner.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
or
absolute
because
--
i
mean
if
they
--
it
has
to
act
through
its
agent.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
it
may
get
it
actually
by
--
in
all
this
verbally
given
or
it
may
be
constructible
or
because
of
the
condition
that
has
prevailed
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
correct.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
if
--
if
there
was
any
proof
that
that
was
a
negligent
act.
there
was
no
proof
of
that
in
this
record
though.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
don't
--
and
i
don't
think
there's
--
that
will
be
a
proof
of
--
of
the
facts
that
there
was
a
trap,
however,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
thought
judge
black
added
some
things
that
he
realized
that
if
a
--
a
potential
danger
to
somebody
and
all
of
those
things,
i
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
--
i
thought
that
you
would
uphold
more
than
the
simple
statement
that
--
that
justice
just
asked
me.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
i
would
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
i
would
be
very
--
quite
closely
approach
it,
i
think.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
not
in
the
sense
of
a
bare
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
--
trap.
i
don't
mean
--
some
one
who's
lured
into
a
position
of
danger
which
is
unusual
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
--
and
not
discoverable.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
no,
it
goes
further
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
with
the
intention,
almost
the
intention
of
harm
in
order
to
have
the
trap.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
that
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i've
--
i've
cited
the
cases
and
many
of
much
i
think
i've
--
i've
cited
from.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
all
right,
that
very
much
requires
this
case,
i
think.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well
--
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
if
--
and
that
must
be
something
of
a
--
of
particularly
hazardous
condition
of
which
the
party
would
know
nothing.
this
would
be
an
ordinary
--
this
would,
i
would
consider,
an
--
an
ordinary
act
of
negligence
and
--
and
not
with
any
intention
of
harm
or
hurt
like
setting
a
bad
trap
or
something
of
that
kind.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
well,
i
don't
--
the
cases
--
i
don't
know
if
that
constitute
a
trap,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
george
a.
garvey
that's
right.
and
all
the
cases
that
counsel
refers
to
is
the
case
of
mason
against
higgins.
it
was
one
where
a
man
owned
an
automobile.
and
he
knew
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
but
did
not
anticipate
that
it
would
lead
to
an
accident.
he
invited
somebody
in
the
car
he
was
riding
and
that
--
that
defect
was
the
cause
of
the
accident.
