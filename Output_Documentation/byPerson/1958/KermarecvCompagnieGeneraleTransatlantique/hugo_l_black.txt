justice
hugo
l.

may
i
ask
you
one
question?
how
did
the
court
below
hold
that
the
defendant
could
have
known?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
imputed,
how
did
you
say
they
could
ever
get
knowledge?what
would
guilt
show
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
just
haven't
quite
understood
yet
with
your
argument,
what
the
court
held
with
reference
to
knowledge.
how
could
they
get
knowledge
except
through
their
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understood
they
meant
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
quite
different
from
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
other
contrary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
could
be
true,
couldn't
it?
you
would
have
something
that
was
--
of
search
in
neutral
nature
that
no
reasonable
man
can
draw
an
inference
(inaudible)
the
--
the
only
point
i
was
interested
in
was
how
you
could
give
them
knowledge
if
not
through
the
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
there's
been
--
if
there
had
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there's
been
some
kind
of
a
trap
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
there
had
been
some
kind
of
a
trap
there
(inaudible)
justice

in
spite
that
he
came,
there
would
liability.
justice
hugo
l.

so,
what
would
that
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
a
tort?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
a
tort?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
a
maritime
tort?

black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
your
--
i'm
just
trying
to
get
clear.
i
think
that
maybe
as
to
--
do
you
--
do
you
argue
that
unless
there's
some
kind
of
a
relationship
of
employee-employer,
employer
to
employee
and
something
of
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
it
would
not
be
a
maritime
tort
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
although
it
would
be
a
--
a
tort?
justice

depending
on
the

relation

depending
on
the
relation.

i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
the
transporting.
applying

applying
to
defects,
let's
see
if
i
can
understand.
suppose
--
assume
now
that
i
understand
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
was
not
permitted
that
(inaudible)
but
assume
that
this
tack
was
there,
the
employee
who
put
it
in
and
knew
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
hold
up
and
it
was
dangerous
to
walk
down
and
that
a
man
just
walking
up
and
down
wouldn't
see
that,
would
that
be
the
kind
of
thing
you
called
a
trap?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
exactly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
you're
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
(inaudible)
suppose
a
reasonable
man
could
infer
from
this
--
this
evidence.
this
tack
was
put
in
there
by
the
employee
and
he
knew
it
would
(inaudible)
employee
and
he
knew
that
the
man
walking
up
and
down
the
steps
couldn't
tell
it
was
danger
and
that
the
man
then
fell
down
on
account
of
that
fact,
would
that
be
a
trap?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
that
--
from
what
you
say
there
i
would
think
that'd
be
the
same
as
nearly
all
other
law.
in
other
words,
if
there's
enough
evidence
to
show
who
--
if
there's
danger
there
and
should
have
been
protected
against,
then
that's
(inaudible)
under
new
york
law
or
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
gather.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
didn't
intend
to
harm
but
they
just
--
they
knew
it
was
dangerous
at
the
time
they
put
it
there,
did
and
left
it
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
--
do
they
hold
in
new
york
that
a
man
couldn't

justice
hugo

and
that's
what
you
