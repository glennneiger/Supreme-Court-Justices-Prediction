may
it
please

mr.
edward
j.

this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirming
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
setting
aside
a
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
dismissing
his
complaint.
the
action
was
brought
by
the
plaintiff-petitioner
to
recover
damages
for
personal
injuries
sustained
by
him
in
1948
while
a
guest
of
a
crew
member
on
the
s.
s.
oregon,
a
passenger
vessel
owned
by
the
defendant-respondent
cooperation.
the
vessel
at
the
time
was
berthed
at
a
pier
in
the
north
river
in
the
port
of
new
york.
the
complaint
alleged
the
negligence
of
the
defendant,
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel
and
set
forth
the
diversity
of
the
parts.
the
accident
which
gives
rise
to
the
suit
occurred
out
of
the
following
circumstances.
a
crew
member
by
the
name
of
yves
of
the
s.
s.
oregon
obtained
a
pass
from
the
commanding
officer
of
the
vessel
so
that
kermarec
could
visit
him
aboard
the
vessel
when
the
vessel
arrived
in
new
york.
this
pass
was
issued
in
accordance
with
the
customary
practice
permitting
crew
members
to
entertain
guests
that
visit
their
family
aboard
the
vessel.
this
pass
was
obtained
by
the
crew
member
and
was
retained
by
him
throughout
this
incident.
it
was
never
shown
the
plaintiff.
it
was
never
explained
to
him.
he
never
saw
and
knew
its
contents.
and
in
due
course
pursuant
to
arrangement,
kermarec
boarded
the
vessel.
after
some
time
and
as
he
was
leaving,
the
visit
--
the
visit
having
terminated,
yves,
the
crew
member
directed
him
to
a
central
stairway,
a
stairway
used
in
common
by
passengers
as
well
as
by
crew
members.
the
stairway
at
the
time
was
covered
by
a
canvas
runner,
a
single
piece
of
linen
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick,
which
ran
the
entire
length
of
the
stairway.
photographs
of
the
stairway
including
the
affixed
canvas
runner
are
attached
to
the
transcript
at
pages
89
and
91.
as
kermarec
started
to
descend
the
stairway,
it
appeared
to
him
in
all
respects
normal
and
safe.
about
four
steps
from
the
bottom
however,
the
canvas
suddenly
slipped
from
under
his
feet.
he
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
fracturing
his
hip.
as
he
was
lying
on
the
deck
at
the
base
of
the
stairway,
he
noticed
that
the
canvas
was
hanging
loose
from
the
edge
of
the
fourth
step.
the
testimony
for
the
most
part
is
uncontested
and
is
obtained
chiefly
from
the
defendant's
own
witnesses
by
way
of
deposition.
that
it
was
the
routine
and
customary
practice
for
a
porter,
by
the
name
of
bourdon
to
wash,
cleans
the
stairway
and
to
cover
it
with
a
canvas
runner
as
soon
as
the
vessel
arrived
in
port,
to
keep
it
clean
until
the
new
batch
of
passengers
embark.
and
the
facts
disclosed
that
the
vessel
had
arrived
the
day
preceding
the
accident
at
which
time
bourdon
had
performed
the
routine
duty.
and
that
at
8
o'clock
the
following
morning,
the
day
of
the
accident,
he
had
to
remove
the
canvas
and
wash
the
stairs
a
second
time
because
of
what
appeared
to
be
the
heavy
traffic
of
the
crew
on
the
stairway
causing
the
need
within
less
than
24
hours
of
renewing
the
cleanliness
of
the
stairway.
this
witness
also
testified
that
he
had
been
instructed
to
keep
this
canvas
runner
tight
so
there
would
be
no
trouble.
the
testimony
further
is
clear
that
he
affixed
the
stairway,
the
canvas
runner
to
the
stairway
by
the
use
of
two
tacks
at
the
front
edge
of
each
step,
the
two
tacks
being
at
the
extreme
edge
--
edges
of
the
canvas
runner.
on
one
of
the
photographs,
i
think
on
page
90,
bourdon,
the
porter,
marked
two
crosses
indicating
the
place
where
he
affixed
the
two
tacks
on
each
step.
the
copy
in
the
transcript
is
not
too
clear.
if
the
court
has
any
difficulty
seeing
the
two
crosses,
we
have
photographs
which
make
that
a
little
bit
clearer.
now,
the
two
tacks
which
were
used
for
each
of
these
two
steps
about
12
or
14
in
all
were
the
normal
carpet
size
tacks.
and
bourdon,
the
porter,
in
court
made
a
diagram
of
what
those
tacks
looked
like
--
looked
like,
and
you
can
find
those,
your
honor,
on
page
89.
it
is
conceded
that
these
two
tacks
per
step
were
the
only
means
used
to
keep
the
canvas
against
the
stairway.
there
were
no
tacks
at
the
rear
of
the
step
holding
the
canvas
toward
the
rear
of
the
step.
there
were
no
tacks
used
or
other
means
to
keep
the
canvas
firm
and
straight
against
the
riser
to
the
step
above.
and
mr.
bourdon
also
testified,
without
contradiction,
that
it
was
quite
easy
to
remove
this
canvas
runner
and
the
tacks.
and
in
his
own
words,
it
was
simply,
“you
take
hold
of
the
canvas
and
the
tacks
come
out
by
themselves.”
this
case
was
tried
twice
to
a
jury.
on
the
first
trial,
there
was
a
disagreement.
on
the
second
trial,
before
the
second
trial
judge,
the
court
dismissed
the
course
of
action
on
the
basis
of
unseaworthiness
and
ruled
that
in
this
case,
a
maritime
tort
was
not
tendered
to
the
court
for
adjudication,
notwithstanding
the
undeniable
testimony
that
the
accident
had
occurred
on
an
oceangoing
vessel.
the
accident
had
occurred
on
the
vessel
while
the
vessel
was
berthed
in
navigable
waters,
that
the
accident
occurred
on
the
vessel
due
to
a
defectively
maintained
canvas
runner
on
a
ship
stairway,
that
the
accident
occurred
because
of
an
invitation
from
a
crew
member
in
a
foreign
port,
who
had
a
friend
visit
him
with
the
authorized
consent
and
knowledge
of
the
shipowner
notwithstanding
that
the
complaint
raised
the
general
maritime
law
questions
and
issues
of
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
because
the
court
was
convinced
that
this
was
not
a
maritime
tort
which
was
tendered
to
him,
he
felt
obliged
to
apply
the
law
of
new
york
and
accordingly
said
and
held
that
contributory
negligence
would
be
a
defense
and
not
comparative
negligence.
and
compelled
by
the
conclusion
that
this
was
not
a
maritime
tort,
he
ruled
out
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness.
he
further
held
that
the
plaintiff-petitioner
was
a
licensee,
the
words
“mere
licensee”,
“bare
licensee”,
“gratuitous
licensee”
were
used.
and
accordingly
under
what
he
thought
to
be
the
applicable
law
of
new
york,
the
jury
was
charged
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
be
covered
unless
the
jury
found
that
the
shipowner
had
actual
knowledge
that
the
stairway
created
a
dangerous
condition
which
the
shipowner
either
failed
to
repair
or
warn
the
petitioner
about.
because
of
the
restrictive
clause
as
to
liability
on
the
pass,
the
trial
judge
also
charged
the
jury
that
the
pass
would
not
be
binding
upon
the
plaintiff
unless
the
jury
found
that
the
contents
of
the
pass
had
been
brought
to
the
plaintiff's
attention.
the
jury
brought
in
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
now,
thereafter
upon
motion,
the
judge,
in
a
rather
brief
memorandum
opinion,
dismissed
the
complaint
instead
of
first
set
aside
the
verdict
than
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
complete
absence
of
proof
that
the
shipowner-defendant
knew
that
this
stairway
presented
a
dangerous
condition.
the
court
below
affirmed
by
divided
court,
judges
watermen
and
i
believe,
harlan
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
--
lumbard
affirming
and
chief
judge
clark
dissenting.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
it
is
not
quite
clear,
sir,
whether
they
did
or
not
from
the
opinion.
they
did
not
address
themselves
to
what
i
think
were
fairly
probable
errors
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
there
is
the
reference
to
new
york
law
and
federal
cases
so
that
there
isn't
--
except
for
the
--
the
discussion
of
the
court
as
to
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness,
there
is
no
clean
expression
of
what
the
applicable
law
was.
the
court
below
merely
affirmed
the
classical
definition
of
the
duty
owned
--
owed
to
a
licensee
and
then
held
that
both
under
the
test
of
a
licensee
as
well
as
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
hawn
versus
talbot
--
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn
under
neither
situation
for
the
plaintiff
recover.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
in
my
opinion,
sir,
i
think
there's
absolutely
no
question
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
this
was
a
maritime
tort
and
therefore,
the
general
or
federal
maritime
law
applies
exclusively.
and
in
view
of
the
supremacy
of
the
general
maritime
law,
this
court
is
free
to
decide
three
questions
which
are
before
it
for
the
first
time.
there
are
five
issues
though,
which
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
three
of
those
issues
are
really
novel.
and
in
the
order
of
which
i
have
developed
them
in
the
brief,
i
would
like
to
enumerate
these
questions.
first,
was
it
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
to
refuse
to
hold
that
this
was
a
maritime
tort,
that
the
general
maritime
law
was
applicable?
second,
assuming
that
the
federal
maritime
law
is
applicable,
is
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
as
one
of
the
applicable
doctrines
on
the
general
maritime
law?
mr.
edward
j.
malament
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
it
did
not.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
edward
j.
malament
there's
negligence.
there's
the
whole
question
as
i
would
develop
it,
sir,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
satisfy
the
--
in
short
the
verdict
as
found
by
the
jury
even
under
the
erroneous
charge
of
the
law
that
this
man
was
the
licensee.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
we
submit
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
no,
we
--
we
submit,
sir,
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
as
we
understand
them
and
as
i
recently
adverted
to
by
the
court
in
the
decision
of
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn
that
the
plaintiff,
in
a
situation
like
this,
lawfully
authorize
this
to
be
aboard
the
vessel
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
general
laws
of
negligence
as
well
as
unseaworthiness.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
well,
no.
not
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
--
necessarily,
sir.
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
that
in
the
application
of
doctrines
of
negligence,
some
of
the
common
law
requirements
need
not
be
followed
by
this
court
under
its
unique
capacity
to
declare
the
federal
maritime
law.
in
other
words
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
exactly,
sir.
as
you
did
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
precisely.
as
you
did,
sir,
when
you
decided
--
this
court
decided
that
the
doctrine
of
contributory
negligence
would
not
be
imported
into
the
general
maritime
law.
so
the
first
question
being
whether
it
was
a
maritime
tort,
the
second
question
being
whether
or
not
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
my
recollection
is,
sir,
and
i
authored
this
differently,
my
recollection
is
that
these
--
the
cases
in
which
the
doctrine
of
comparative
negligence
was
adopted,
max
morris
case,
then
later
on
annunciated,
and
the
pope
&
talbot
case
were
cases
involving
both
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
and
i
would
not,
at
this
point,
be
sure
of
which
cases
held
which.
in
any
event,
we
say
that
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
apart
assuming
that
it's
not
applicable
and
is
not
in
the
case.
this
court,
for
the
first
time,
is
presented
with
the
opportunity
of
declaring
definitively
whether
what
is
the
standard
of
care
owed
to
a
person
lawfully
aboard
a
vessel.
put
it
another
way.
for
the
first
time,
this
court
has
asked
to
declare
whether
it
adopts
the
common
law
categories
of
invitee
and
licensee
or
whether
since
it
is
the
--
before
the
court
for
the
first
time,
whether
it
may
not
or
should
not
adapt
to
a
single
standard
of
care
for
all
persons
who
are
lawfully
aboard
a
vessel.
question
number
four,
assuming
that
the
court
decides
that
it
is
found
to
perpetuate
these
common
law
distinctions,
then
the
next
question
is
whether
or
not
the
courts
below
erred
in
holding
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
licensee
and
not
an
invitee.
the
fifth
and
last
question
is,
assuming
that
the
courts
below
were
correct
in
classifying
the
plaintiff
as
a
licensee,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
verdict
in
his
favor
and
wasn't
the
setting
aside
of
the
verdict
an
improper
interference
with
the
judicial
jury
function
of
the
trial
court?”
i
will
not
spend
too
much
time
on
the
first
question.
i
think
that
the
cases
are
fairly
clear,
imbrovek
and
the
rest,
that
this
was
a
maritime
tort
and
that
the
general
maritime
law
is
applicable,
and
that
the
court
erred
in
refusing
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
comparative
negligence
and
the
courts
below
erred
in
refusing
to
hold
that
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i'm
just
about
to
address
myself
to
that.
in
view
of
the
plaintiff's
verdict,
the
refusal
of
the
charge
comparative
negligence
was
non-prejudicial.
the
refusal
however
to
charge
unseaworthiness
was
prejudicial
because
in
light
of
the
attitude
of
the
courts
below
that
there
was
no
proof
of
actual
notice
that
application
or
refusal
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
was
most
prejudicial
since
it
would
have
obviated
the
need
for
notice
had
the
doctrine
been
found
to
be
applicable
to
the
petitioner.
i
agree
with
you,
sir,
that
contributory
negligence
in
this
case
was
a
non-prejudicial
error.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
well,
except
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
--
that
--
i
would
say
so,
i
would
say
so.
no
question
about
that.but
the
court,
as
you
will
find
in
his
opinion,
the
memorandum
opinion
on
page
80
--
93,
followed
notwithstanding,
the
jury's
finding
and
the
court's
charge,
there
was
no
proof,
complete
failure
of
proof
that
the
shipowner
knew,
defendant-shipowner
knew
that
the
stairway
presented
a
dangerous
condition.
i
turn
then
now
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
troublesome
question
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
is
or
should
be
applicable
to
the
authorized
guest
of
a
seaman
aboard
the
vessel.
it
is
only
14
years,
i
believe,
since
the
mahnich
decision.
all
together
this
doctrine
has
had
a
development
under
the
auspices
of
this
court
of
less
than
55
years,
osceola,
1903.
in
the
past
decade,
this
court
has
developed
the
doctrine
to
the
point
where
it
is
not
only
applicable
to
seamen
but
to
longshoremen
and
to
non-longshoremen,
old
men
who
are
doing
the
equivalence
of
ship's
work.
it
has
gone
beyond
that.
it
has
said
that
the
logic
of
the
doctrine
and
for
the
reasons
that
gave
it
rise
the
doctrine
should
apply
whether
or
not
the
ship
or
its
appurtenance
becomes
unseaworthy
through
negligent
maintenance
as
the
mahnich
case.
it
has
held
that
the
doctrine
applies
whether
or
not
the
appurtenance
is
brought
on
to
the
vessel
by
the
stevedore
or
the
longshoreman
and
even
though
the
appurtenance
of
the
new
equipment
that's
brought
on
may
be
under
the
control
of
the
longshoreman.
it
has
said
that
when
a
member
of
a
crew,
that's
the
alaska-petterson
case,
this
court
has
held
that
when
a
member
of
the
crew
is
not
equal
in
temperament
to
the
ordinary
seaman
aboard
the
vessel
and
such
seaman
injures
another
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
that
unequal
seaman
also
creates
an
unseaworthy
condition
that
were
joined
up.
these
recent
decisions
by
the
court,
as
we
see
it,
are
grounded
on
two
premises.
the
first
that
the
nature
of
a
maritime
operation
onboard
a
commercial
vessel
was
still
a
hazardous
occupation.
but
in
view
of
the
highly-industrialized
nature
of
modern
merchant
marine,
many
new
classifications
of
workers
are
exposed
to
the
hazards
which,
at
one
time,
confronted
only
the
seamen
in
the
days
of
the
sailing
vessel.
the
danger
remains
the
same
in
1958
as
before.
the
second
rationale
for
these
recent
decisions
is
that
as
between
the
victim
of
an
unseaworthy
condition
and
his
dependants,
the
shipowner
still
remains
best
able
to
assume
and
spread
the
risk
in
the
industry.
that
without
the
protection
of
this
liberal
doctrine,
victims
of
unseaworthy
appurtenances
who
are
not
able
to
discover
it
or
remove
it
may
be
left
without
a
remedy
if
they
are
required
to
prove
their
case
under
the
usual
laws
of
negligence.
perhaps
as
was
to
be
anticipated,
these
recent
decisions
have
left
the
maritime
bar
and
bench
in
some
degree
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
ultimate
scope
of
the
doctrine.
i
think
in
one
of
our
footnotes,
we
have
collated
the
cases
which
arose
in
the
last
year.
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
circuit
that
had
--
had
one
or
more
of
these
cases
before
it.
i
know
that
this
court
in
the
brief
history
of
this
term
has
already
heard
argument
on
two
such
cases.
now,
one
says
ours
presents
an
extreme
situation.
we
cannot
come
within
any
immediate
translation
of
ship's
work.
and
yet
we
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
reasons
which
gave
rise
to
the
extension
of
the
doctrine
are
applicable
to
anyone
who
has
was
injured
aboard
a
vessel
in
furtherance
of
the
welfare
or
the
operation
of
the
vessel
whether
in
direct
or
indirect
degree
because
otherwise
an
anomalous
situation
develops.
the
longshoreman,
the
carpenter
can
be
protected
but
what
about
the
governmental
inspector,
the
immigration
official,
the
customs
guard
or
coast
guard
agent?
what
about
the
host
of
other
classifications
who
necessarily
must
visit
a
vessel
with
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
the
shipowner
in
order
to
conduct
a
modern
and
safe
merchant
marine?
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
wish
that
were
so
but
i
think
you
will
find
--
in
fact,
there
is
one
case
that's
now
pending
before
this
court,
the
mcdaniel's
case,
i
believe,
where
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
these
government
officials,
in
one
fashion
or
another,
may
be
invitees.
i
know
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
case
of
the
law.
i
have
a
--
fixed
a
rather
short
appendix
to
the
--
to
the
end
of
my
brief
showing
the
confusion
that
exists
in
the
state
law
cases
as
to
what
is
the
precise
duty
and
status
of
a
fireman
or
policeman,
a
government
--
semi-governmental
official
or
a
government
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
precisely.
and
all
my
--
and
what's
more,
sir,
as
i
will
develop
the
point
later,
within
the
same
jurisdiction,
you
can
find
contrary
opinions,
the
cases
are
just
completely
irreconcilable
because
the
doctrine
by
this
time
has
become
so
completely
confounded
that
there
is
no
longer
any
rationale
or
usefulness
for
the
entire
doctrine.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
correct.
and
two
juries
disagreed
--
two
juries
had
a
test
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
well,
any
--
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
and
just
a
right
ahead
of
myself
a
little
bit.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
agree,
your
honor,
if
--
in
new
york
state
law
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
if
i
may,
sir,
i
would
say
that
--
well,
that
is
basically
correct.
in
the
area
of
invitee,
the
semantics,
the
--
the
stretching
--
the
reaching
for
essential
of
justice
by
the
courts
who
are
confronted
with
this
morass
of
irreconcilable
decisions
is
in
quality
and
in
degree
worse
than
the
situation
that
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
well,
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
exactly
what
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
but
precisely,
you'll
find
out
in
my
--
in
my
third
point
and
which
i
say
the
time
has
come
to
exorcise
this
body
of
law
and
to
do,
by
judicial
declaration,
what
was
done
last
year
in
1957
in
england.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
there
--
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
did,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
--
i
thought
that
it
was
time
to
--
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
will
accept
the
suggestion.
anyway,
coming
back
--
so
that
i
could
pass
this
point
of
unseaworthiness,
the
courts
have
been
troubled
by
the
doctrine
and
they
have
taken
two
views,
which
i've
attempted
to
explain
and
describe
in
the
brief.
there
are
those
who
indicate
a
--
a
--
an
antipathy
toward
the
doctrine.
they
don't
like
it.
they
talk
pretty
colloquially.
and
they
are
restricting
it.
there
are
those,
on
the
other
hand,
who
believe
that
the
logic
of
the
doctrine
should
be
extended
to
its
ultimate
conclusion.
and
whether
the
court
decides
it
today
or
in
the
future,
without
any
way
attempting
to
--
to
urge
upon
the
court
a
waiver
or
a
modification
of
its
usual
reluctance
to
meet
an
issue
unless
it's
necessary,
i
pose
these
two
questions
to
the
court.
if
the
block
and
tackle
which
had
brought
aboard
the
vessel
by
a
longshoreman
or
stevedore
is
defective
and
as
a
result,
a
sling
load
falls
injuring
another
longshoreman,
that
longshoreman
may
recover
from
the
vessel
on
the
ground
of
unseaworthiness.
but
assume
that
the
same
block
and
tackle
broke,
the
same
sling
load
fell
and
instead
of
hitting
a
longshoreman
or
a
seaman,
it
hits
one
of
these
inspectors
who
are
on
the
vessel,
should
it
make
any
difference?
let
me
put
it
another
way.
the
same
man
who
runs
amuck
and
who
knives
a
crew
member
or
a
longshoreman
in
--
the
victim
can
recover
because
the
vessel
has
rendered
unseaworthy.
but
suppose
the
same
victim,
the
same
seaman
should
injure
the
--
the
union
official
that
comes
aboard
to
--
to
settle
some
grievances
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
the
marine
insurance
underwriting
investigator
who
comes
aboard
to
investigate
a
claim,
should
that
make
any
difference
what
the
status
of
the
victim
is
in
a
situation
where
the
vessel
itself
is
unseaworthy?
and
when
we
ask
this
court
to
transcribe
and
extend
the
doctrine
to
its
logical
conclusion,
all
we're
asking
the
court
to
--
to
enlarge
the
responsibility
in
reality
of
the
shipowner
who
must,
by
law,
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel
or
are
we
by
that
asking
and
guaranteeing
that
the
shipowner
will
buy
that
much
more,
execute
his
responsibility
and
make
sure
that
the
vessel
is
seaworthy.
this
is
the
scope
of
the
problem.
the
case
in
which
the
court
has
utterly
divided
do
not
compel
them
to
go
as
far
as
i
would
have
the
court
go
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
eventually
the
question
of
whether
a
man
who
was
lawfully
aboard
the
vessel
must
be
answered
as
to
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
extends
to
him.
it'll
be
better
if
the
court
should
hold
that
it
does
extend
to
an
invitee
as
distinguished
from
a
licensee.
but
the
minute
the
court
begins
to
affix
this
status,
that
it's
more
important
to
the
law,
the
general
admiralty
law,
the
confusion
which
i
will
now
address
myself
to,
which
should
not
be
permitted,
namely,
the
classification
should
not
be
used
at
least
so
far
as
the
federal
maritime
law
is
concerned.
now,
with
respect
to
my
third
point,
as
i've
said
before,
this
court
has
never
definitively
stated
the
duty
owed
to
a
lawfully
authorized
visitor.
and
we
have
indicated
the
confusion
which
now
exists,
we
only,
i
think,
for
our
purposes,
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
occupiers
--
the
--
the
1957
act
passed
in
england
in
--
which
abolished
the
distinction
between
licensee
and
invitee
and
imposed
a
single
standard
of
care
upon
all
persons
or
upon
all
occupiers
in
favor
of
persons
lawfully
upon
the
premises
whether
or
not
the
premises
were
movable
or
fixed
including
vessel.
copies
of
the
act
as
well
as
the
law
reform
commission's
report,
committee
report
have
been
made
available
to
the
court.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
the
british
act.
but
1957
is
when
the
act
went
into
effect,
the
occupiers
liability
act
and
the
law
reform
committee
report
was
released
in
1954.
and
in
our
brief,
i've
adverted
to
the
development
of
the
english
law
to
--
to
show
that
even
before
the
law
reform
committee
report
was
released,
there
had
been
widespread
protest
at
the
development.
and
the
absurdity
of
perpetuating
a
distinction
which
placed
a
premium
on
negligence
and
rewarded
the
careless,
the
occupier
who
did
not
bother
to
inspect
this
premise
--
premises
who
plead
that
there
was
no
subjective
knowledge
and
therefore
could
escape
his
responsibility
to
a
licensee.
but
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
there
certainly
would,
sir,
in
any
event.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
except
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
consulted
the
court
in
that
distinction
except
that
i
think
that
these
--
these
are
not
separate
issues.
i
think
that
as
the
cases
hold
in
new
york,
you
can
find
the
cases
which
would
--
which
would
make
the
shipowner
responsible
both
to
--
as
a
licensee,
to
him
also
as
an
invitee.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
as
--
for
reason
which
i've
already
developed,
we
would
ask
the
court
not
to
resort
to
the
new
york
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
except
for
one
observation,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
judge
murphy
below
and
if
you
read
the
majority
opinions
of
the
court
below,
you
will
find
in
effect
that
they
are
subscribing
to
the
doctrine
that
the
shipowner,
the
occupier
who
does
not
inspect
his
premises,
therefore
has
no
subject
of
knowledge
of
the
condition
and
therefore
escapes
liability.
these
two
courts
below
attempting,
i
believe,
to
apply
and
describe
the
new
york
law
have
done
so.
and
i
think
in
the
appendix,
if
i
recall
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
well,
i
suppose
that
is
perhaps
a
permissible
interpretation.
i
--
i
don't
follow
that.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
case
in
the
appendix
where
a
driver
of
a
car
was
held
--
was
not
held
responsible
to
passengers
who
are
injured
because,
as
the
court
put
it,
if
he
knew
there
was
something
that
was
wrong
but
he
did
not
think
that
it
was
anything
serious,
then
there's
no
liability.
but
if
he,
as
an
intelligent
man,
should
have
been
concerned
that
this
knocking
or
(inaudible)
that
he
heard
was
--
might
be
something
serious,
then
he
was
responsible.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
that
was
the
holding
of
the
case
except
that
there
were
overtones
in
that
case
if
the
court
recalls,
that
as
to
the
father,
there
was
no
danger,
no
real
--
that
the
vessel
in
a
sense
was
unseaworthy
because
of
the
arrangement
of
the
place
for
that
tack,
if
i
recall
the
holding
correctly.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
case
where
there
were
other
factors
which
were
not
addressed,
which
the
court
did
not
address
itself
to.
also,
i
believe,
as
i
recall
that
case,
the
argument
that
the
son
was
--
no
matter
what
he
had
done
before,
no
matter
how
usefully
he
may
--
he
might
have
been
to
his
father
had
outlived
his
usefulness
because
he
finished
putting
the
tank
into
place
and
therefore
he
didn't
get
off
the
vessel
immediately.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
he
was
a
guest.
and
i
think
that
in
our
modern
jurisdiction,
so
long
as
the
guest
is
lawfully
aboard
the
vessel,
the
single
stand
of
the
cash
should
be
given
to
him.
and
that
these
distinctions,
the
licensee
and
invitee
mere
bare
gratuitous
about
their
usefulness.
the
doctrine
itself,
i
think
it's
pretty
well
recognized,
is
rooted
in
a
futile
system
and
has
a
class
base,
a
narrow
class
base.
in
any
event,
if
this
is
court
should
feel
that
it
must
perpetuate
these
distinctions
between
invitee
and
licensee,
we
hold
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
an
invitee,
an
invitee
under
every
possible
test.
in
terms
of
invitation,
there's
no
question
that
a
test
was
issued
to
--
directly
to
this
man
in
his
name,
so
that
his
presence
was
known
and
authorized.
the
cases
hold
that
under
that
circumstance,
invitation
is
enough
to
ground
a
status
of
invitee.
there
was
economic
benefit
for
many
reasons.
judge
clark
said,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
improve
on
his
words,
the
potency
of
his
reasoning,
that
is
to
the
shipowners'
benefit
to
keep
his
crew
members
aboard
the
vessel
because
if
it's
for
a
foreign
port
or
any
port,
they
go
ashore
and
now
injured,
then
under
the
(inaudible),
and
the
warner
and
the
caroline
(ph)
case,
and
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
shipowner
is
responsible
for
at
least
maintenance
and
cure.
and
so
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
shipowner
to
keep
his
men
aboard
the
vessel
and
to
extend
to
him
those
courtesies
which
will
keep
them
on
the
vessel,
so
that
in
case
of
emergency
they
are
available,
so
they
will
not
be
late
in
rejoining
the
vessel,
requiring
pure
head
jumps
and
replace
these
on
short
notice.
it
takes
into
account
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
shipowner
to
keep
his
men
aboard
the
vessel
in
our
modern
day,
when
tankers
and
passenger
vessels
and
even
commercial
vessels
keep
tight
schedules
and
meet
the
tide
sometime
within
12
hours
so
that
the
realities
of
life
are
that
the
average
seaman
must
transact
his
personal
business
aboard
the
vessels,
see
his
friends,
see
his
family,
take
care
of
personal
needs.
he
may
not
be
able
to
take
four
hours
off
to
come
from
bay
on
to
new
york
when
the
tanker
will
leave
in
about
12
hours.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
should
like
to
answer
that
question
in
two
ways,
sir.
first,
if
it
is
not
in
the
shipowner's
interest
to
accept
this
liability,
then
all
it
need
to
do
is
to
refuse
to
grant
a
pass
to
those
people
who,
we
say,
if
given
a
pass,
become
invitees.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
--
it
is
a
discretionary
act
whether
kermarec
or
anyone
else
might
board
the
vessel
in
the
interest
of
a
crew
member.
to
that
extent,
there
is
control.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
a
pass.
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
precisely.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
precisely.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
correct.
i
think
it
would
be
anomalous
situation.
if
we
should
permit
a
guest
of
a
passenger
to
be
held
to
be
an
invitee,
as
the
cases
do,
but
the
guest
of
a
crew
member
should
be
denied
the
same
status
should
there
be
a
difference
between
the
passenger's
guest
and
the
crew
member's
guest.
judge
clark
said
there
was
never
anomalous
phase
of
this
case.
it
is
recognized
the
new
york
law
and
in
many
jurisdictions
that
the
guest
of
a
tenant,
the
guest
of
a
janitor
may
hold
the
landlord
responsible
in
the
case
of
a
multiple
dwelling
when
the
guest
is
injured
on
a
common
stairway
which
is
defectively
maintained.
and
there
should
be,
therefore,
no
difference
between
the
liability
and
responsibility
of
the
ship
in
the
maintenance
of
the
common
stairways
used
by
crew
members,
passengers
and
the
guest
of
crew
members
and
the
guest
of
passengers.
the
court
below
felt
there
was
an
interesting
analogy
but
it
was
not
free
to
adopt
it
because
of
the
pressing.
lastly,
we
turn
to
the
question,
assuming
that
the
courts
below
were
correct
and
that
our
client,
mr.
kermarec
was
not
an
invitee
but
he
was
a
licensee.
even
so,
this
condition
of
the
stairway,
the
tacking
on
of
the
canvas
runner
was
done
as
an
affirmative
act
by
an
employee
of
the
defendant
in
the
regular
course
of
his
business.
in
that
sense,
he
satisfies
the
test
of
an
affirmative
act.
and
the
shipowner
is
responsible
under
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior.
and
subjective
knowledge
on
the
part
shipowner
under
that
condition
is
not
necessary.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
where
it
is
--
the
act
of
negligence
is
an
affirmative
act
of
an
employee
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
duties.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
would
--
i'd
go
along
with
that,
of
course.
the
courts
below
didn't
see
that
way.
but
assuming
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
the
affirmative
act
of
negligence
which
would
make
the
shipowner
responsible,
we
have
a
second
proposition
which
is
recognized
by
the
authorities,
that
the
condition
of
the
stairway,
the
condition
of
the
stairway
was
known
to
the
employee
who
had
created
the
condition.
and
there
were
other
cases
which
hold
that
where
the
condition
is
known
by
the
employee
or
created
by
the
employee,
whether
or
not
that
condition
is
a
dangerous
condition,
is
a
matter
of
the
objective
test
of
reasonable
knowledge
of
notice.
and
applying
the
doctrine,
the
facts
of
the
case
through
the
last
situation,
the
licensee
situation,
i
should
like
to
read
from
this
one
paragraph
of
the
brief
in
which
i
say,
on
page
31,
as
to
the
first
question
as
to
whether
a
dangerous
condition
existed,
the
question
was
not
only
the
size
or
the
adequacy
of
the
facts
but
whether
considering
the
length
of
the
runner,
the
canvas
runner,
the
heavy
traffic
on
the
stairway,
two
carpet
tacks
removable
by
hand
alone
and
placed
only
at
the
front-end
--
at
--
at
the
front
of
each
tread
with
nothing
to
hold
the
canvas
in
place
at
the
rear
of
the
step
or
against
the
riser
to
the
step
above
were
sufficient
to
keep
the
canvas
from
coming
loose
and
slipping
both
the
step
under
the
cumulative
weight
and
the
repeating
jarring
of
those
using
the
stairway.
we
may
assume
that
had
a
sufficient
number
of
tacks
been
used,
the
canvas
could
have
been
held
in
place,
but
the
question
before
the
jury
was
simply
whether
two
tacks
alone
were
enough
under
the
circumstance.
to
say
therefore,
as
did
the
court
below
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
tacks
were
inadequate
for
their
purpose,
in
whatever
sense
the
term
adequate
was
used,
is
simply
to
ignore
the
evidence
and
defy
reality.
the
jury
unquestionably
could
find
and
then,
that
a
dangerous
condition
existed
on
the
stairway
as
kermarec
started
to
descend.
if
kermarec
was
a
licensee,
he
was
entitled
to
his
verdict.
and
as
we
pointed
out
before,
where
courts
have
been
divided
on
the
facts
in
the
law
and
where
two
juries
have
disagreed,
can
one
say
under
the
circumstances
that
a
reasonable
man
could
not
have
differed
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
justify
the
verdict.
two
additional
comments
and
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
yes,
the
court
said
that
under
certain
circumstances,
knowledge
could
be
imputed.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
think,
in
fairness
to
what
judge
murphy
was
trying
to
say
in
his
request
to
charge
where
a
colloquy
with
counsel,
it
was
that
a
corporation
can
only
be
held
responsible
through
the
acts
of
employees,
he
did
say
that.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
--
i
would
agree
but
on
--
the
court
said
that,
and
yet
found
that
it
--
they
did
not
have
knowledge.
i
--
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
a
rather
--
brief.
it
was
a
page
and
a
--
less
than
two
pages.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
giving
the
court
every
benefit
of
the
doubt,
i
think
what
it
was
driving
at
was
this.
there
was
no
knowledge
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
a
dangerous
condition
existed.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
and
therefore
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
there
was
therefore
no
basis
for
the
application
of
the
doctrine
that
the
employer,
the
defendant
would
be
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
condition,
the
dangerous
condition,
namely,
the
distinction
between
knowledge
of
the
condition
and
the
nature
of
the
condition
being
imputed.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
answered
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
--
to
understand
precisely
what
the
court
was
driving
at
myself
because
the
test
goes
off
on
the
inadequacy
of
the
tacks.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
tacks
were
inadequate.
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
i
never
did.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
i
agree.
everything
i
know
how
anytime
an
employer
or
a
corporate
employer
can
get
knowledge.
but
in
this
case
that
finally,
the
court
was
saying,
“either
that,
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
because
we
don't
find
a
dangerous
condition
existed.”
mr.
edward
j.
malament
no.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
no.
i
would
say
this.
with
respect
to
an
invitee
by
hypothesis
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
--
then
the
ordinary
rules
of
negligence
apply.
the
reasonable
man
would
think.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
the
licensee.
with
respect
to
a
licensee,
if
the
condition
is
created
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
--
and
there
is
knowledge,
there's
no
question
the
licensee
can
hold
the
--
the
occupier.
but
that
doesn't
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
the
duty
is
now
to
--
within
the
classical
language
of
the
--
of
the
majority.
the
occupier
is
under
a
duty
not
to
inflict
wanton
or
willful
injury,
nor
expose
the
guest
or
the
licensee
in
hidden
danger.
but
beyond
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
to
the
--
to
the
licensee,
that
is
the
old
spring
gun
practice.
beyond
that,
there
being
no
wanton
or
willful
affirmative
act,
the
affirmative
negligence,
there
being
no
hidden
danger,
then
the
licensee
may
not
recover
unless
it
proves,
according
to
the
courts
below,
the
owner
had
subjective
knowledge,
as
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
is,
still
the
--
the
imponderable
in
these
cases,
subjective
knowledge
of
the
condition
exists.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
well,
the
test
of
the
--
of
the
situation
is
this,
that
this
--
the
semantic
morass
into
which
my
client
found
himself
is
one
that
confronts
every
person
who
has
this
problem,
whether
he's
a
licensee
or
invitee.
and
you'll
find
the
exact
words
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
--
of
--
of
judge
murphy.
what
did
he
say?
“under
the
charge
as
it
applied
to
these
facts,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
defendant
should
have
known
of
the
dangerous
conditions
if
in
fact
it
was
dangerous,
but
whether
he'd
actually
did
know
of
it.”
now,
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
frankly,
in
any
event.
we
believe
that
under
all
these
circumstances,
there
was
sufficient
evidence
under
the
erroneous
charge
of
the
court.
it
would
satisfy
even
the
least
desirable
classification
my
client
made
of
the
licensee.
and
that
the
courts
below
should
not
have
tampered
with
the
verdict,
they
should
have
allowed
it
to
stand.
mr.
edward
j.
malament
under
--
mr.
edward
j.
malament
because
of
the
inherit
nature
of
the
facts
which
would
have
satisfied
any
test.
thank
you.
