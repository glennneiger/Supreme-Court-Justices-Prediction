pursuing
for
just
a

question.
let's
assume
that
this
court
answered,
yes,
to
your
first
question,
this
--
the
general
maritime
law
is
applicable,
but
assume
further
that
we
answered
no
to
your
second
question
that
this
man
was
not
covered
by
the
doctrine
of
--
of
unseaworthiness,
then,
what
--
then
what
would
be
the
law
be?
is
a
--
is
a
negligence
action
part
of
the
general
maritime
law?
justice

--
that's
a
common
law
action,

as
to
whether
contributory
negligence
is

now,
in
view
again
of
the
jury's
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
doesn't
it
follow
that
the
jury
necessarily
found
that
the

that
there
was
actual
notice
in

justice

stewart
well,
this
very
--
this
very
case
illustrates
that.
you
have
three
very
competent
and
qualified
judges
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
two
of
them
disagreed
completely

the
other
one
as

what

is
about.

high
seas.this
man
wouldn't
be
aboard,
would
he?
