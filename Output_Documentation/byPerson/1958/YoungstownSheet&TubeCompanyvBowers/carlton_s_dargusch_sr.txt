mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
the
court
please,
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company
versus
bowers,
is
number
9.
and
allied
stores
of
ohio
inc.
versus
bowers
is
number
10,
are
appeals
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
the
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
case
involved
the
question
of
the
ohio
state
taxation
of
imported
ores
and
storage
merchandise
held
by
a
resident
manufacturer.
the
allied
stores
case
involves
only
the
question
of
the
ohio
state
taxation
of
storage
merchandise
held
by
a
resident
retail
merchant.
since
the
facts
in
the
two
cases
differ
somewhat,
i'll
argue
first
the
youngstown
case
and
then
the
allied
case.
more
specifically,
the
questions
presented
in
the
youngstown
case
are,
may
an
ohio
state
statute
constitutionally
impose
an
ad
valorem
tax
upon
both
iron
ores,
which
have
been
imported
from
foreign
countries
and
which
were
stored
in
the
same
form
as
imported
and
not
commingled
with
other
property
of
the
taxpayer.
as
to
the
second
question
of
the
taxation
of
storage
merchandise,
does
an
ohio
state
statute
section
5701.08,
revised
code
of
ohio
deny
residents
to
the
state
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
the
constitution
of
united
states
by
imposing
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
upon
resident
storage
merchandise
held
for
storage
only,
while
at
the
same
time
accepting
the
storage
merchandise
of
non-residents
when
similarly
held
for
storage
only.
those
are
the
two
questions,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
youngstown
case.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
i
plan
to
do
so.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
the
constitutional
questions
involved,
first,
article
i,
10,
cl.2,
"no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress,
laid
any
impost
or
duties".
that
has
been
construed
to
include
taxes
on
imports
or
exports
except
that
which
may
be
necessary
--
absolutely
necessary
for
executing
its
inspection
laws.
the
second
constitutional
provision
involved
is
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
"no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
--
the
equal
--
the
equal
protection
of
the
law."
basically,
the
laws
of
ohio
and
i'm
referring
specifically
to
5709.01
revised
code,
lay
a
tax
on
personal
property
which
is
located
in
ohio
and
used
in
business
in
that
state.
at
this
point,
it
might
be
well,
if
i
explain
the
provisions
of
the
old
section
5701.08
revised
code,
which
are
in
issue
in
this
case.
that
section
was
amended
effective
september
30,
1955,
but
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
statute
as
it
read
before
that
date.
that
--
that
section
imposed
a
tax
upon
the
storage
of
property
or
upon
property
stored.
with
the
proviso,
but
agricultural
products
and
merchandise
belonging
to
a
non-resident
and
held
in
the
storage
warehouse
for
storage
only
in
the
state,
are
not
used
in
business.
so
the
property
of
the
non-resident
was
excluded
by
that
provision,
while
the
property
of
the
resident
was
taxed
by
the
general
provision
taxing
property
held
for
storage.
the
section
as
i
said
is
since
been
amended
with
distinction
between
resident
and
non-resident
withdrawn
by
the
general
assembly
and
a
further
limitation
provided
in
that
for
a
property
to
qualify
as
being
stored
in
ohio
and
excepted
from
taxation,
it
must've
been
shipped
from
without
the
state,
held
for
storage
in
the
state
and
destined
for
shipment
outside.
that
issue
was
not
in
the
--
the
case,
but
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court,
the
statute
has
been
amended.
the
history
of
this
case
is
the
tax
commissioner
for
the
year
1954,
assessed
the
imported
iron
ore
and
storage
merchandise
of
the
taxpayer.
on
appeal
to
the
state
board
of
tax
appeal,
the
ohio
state
board
of
tax
appeals,
the
imported
iron
ore
was
excluded
from
taxation
and
the
storage
merchandise
was
taxed.
on
this
appeal
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
both
the
imported
iron
ore
and
the
storage
merchandise
were
held
taxable.
at
every
stage
in
the
proceedings,
we
raised
the
constitutional
questions
which
we
present
to
the
court
today.
now,
the
--
the
facts
have
been
stipulated.
the
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company
imported
ore
from
five
foreign
countries,
brazil,
cuba,
mexico,
liberia
and
the
canada.
the
ores
from
the
first
four,
in
other
words,
brazil,
cuba,
mexico
and
liberia,
were
purchased
for
relevant
use
in
the
appellant's
open
hearth
furnaces,
while
the
seine
river
ore
or
canadian
ore
was
purchased
for
use
in
the
blast
furnaces
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
33,
justice
brennan,
and
printed
in
the
brief
as
well
at
page
3
in
part.
and
the
movement
of
the
ores
from
brazil,
cuba,
mexico
and
liberia,
the
ores
were
transported
by
ocean
vessel
to
either
baltimore
or
philadelphia.
they
were
unloaded
at
those
ports
and
then
transported
by
rail
to
youngstown,
ohio,
where
they
were
stored
in
the
storage
yards
of
the
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company.
so
far
as
the
seine
river
ore
or
canadian
ore
was
concerned,
that
ore
was
transported
down
the
great
lakes
to
cleveland,
ohio
and
then
over
the
state
of
ohio
by
rail
to
youngstown,
ohio
and
the
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
company.
as
these
ores
were
received
in
youngstown,
they
were
placed
in
piles
and
as
we
received
additional
shipments
of
brazilian
ore,
for
example
and
the
same
apply
to
all
the
ores,
that
particular
type
of
ore,
that
identical
ore
was
placed
upon
the
prior
shipment,
but
there
was
no
commingling
of
brazilian
with
liberian,
cuban,
canadian
or
mexican.
in
other
words,
the
ore
pile
at
all
times,
contained
only
brazilian
ore.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
because
their
characteristics,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
--
because
of
their
characteristics.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
normally
not.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
the
--
with
the
characteristics
of
the
other
ores
that
require
them
to
be
kept
separately.
they
--
they
differ
in
their
chemical
composition
as
i
noted
in
my
statement
of
facts,
for
example,
the
seine
river
ore
was
used
wholly
in
the
blast
furnaces
while
the
other
four
classes
of
ore
were
used
in
the
open
hearth.
but
for
metallurgical
reasons,
the
iron
ores
were
kept
separate
in
their
several
piles.
from
time
to
time,
and
as
needed
by
the
taxpayer,
the
ores
in
these
five
different
piles
were
moved
from
the
storage
yard,
a
substantial
distance
to
the
plant
of
the
taxpayer
or
the
manufacturing
facility,
if
you
please,
where
they're
either
placed
in
what
are
known
as
the
stock
houses
or
stock
bins
that
are
pertinent
to
the
blast
furnaces
and
open
hearth.
there
are
in
the
record,
maps
showing
the
area
over
which
these
ores
would
travel
from
their
storage
yard
to
the
stock
bins
or
stock
houses.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
the
stipulation
shows
that
the
storage
piles
represented
a
minimum
of
three
month's
supply.
and
that
as
needed,
ores
were
moved
to
the
stock
bins
and
the
stock
houses.
the
period
of
supply
there
will
be
relatively
short,
a
matter
of
days
at
the
outside.
that
--
that
is
--
you
will
see
that
in
the
stipulation
i
believe.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
in
bulk.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
in
bulk.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
there's
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
point.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
and
always
added
and
kept
a
minimum
of
three
month's
supply
in
the
pile.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
and
continue
to
use.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
not
less
than
three
months
supply
in
continuous
use.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
that's
possible.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right.
some
distance
away
to
the
stock
bin
or
the
stock
house.
and
to
answer
the
question
that
you
propounded
just
before
the
court
recess,
we
have
raised
no
question
as
to
the
taxability
of
the
ore
in
the
stock
bins
and
stock
houses,
only
as
to
the
ore
that
remains
in
the
major
storage
pile.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
in
a
general
sense,
yes,
sir.
although
the
distance
of
transportation
will
vary
anywhere
from
a
fourth
of
a
mile
up
to
three
miles.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
as
i
said
in
the
record,
you
will
see
the
maps
which
show
the
location
of
the
manufacturing
facilities
in
the
various
storage
yards.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
at
the
back
of
the
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
mr.
justice
black,
if
you'd
look
at
page
43,
the
appendix
1,
you
will
see
the
general
statutes
of
ohio,
the
revised
statutes
which
are
said
to
delay
this
tax
on
--
on
imports.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
oh,
it
doesn't
specify
imports
at
all.
it
just
says
all
personal
property
located
and
used
in
business
without
any
specification
of
imports
or
such
at
all.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
not
to
imports,
no,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
our
contention
as
to
domestic
ores
would
turn
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
held
for
storage
only
and
that
we
get
into,
in
this
case,
in
the
people
protection
phase
of
it.
we
have
not
contended
that
--
that
any
ores
at
youngstown,
however,
are
excluded,
but
only
those
ores
on
lake
erie
docks.
but
that's
the
other
branch
of
the
case.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
it
is
possible.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
it
is
possible.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
the
tax
is
laid
under
the
statute
would
apply
it
with
the
whole
pile.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
the
tax
does
in
fact,
if
you
understand,
under
our
type
of
system.
in
ohio,
you
report
your
inventory
on
a
monthly
basis.so
the
ore
that
might
have
been
in
the
storage
pile
on
january
1,
might
very
well
as
of
february
1st
have
entered
into
the
manufacturing
process
and
had
been
included
as
a
part
of
materials
and
inventory.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
possible.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
as
i've
answered
the
question
before,
i
think
i
answered
it
correctly,
it's
attributable
to
the
whole
pile.
the
most
recent
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
i
didn't
know
i
said
it
could
not
be
there
for
five
years.
i
said
it
was
possible.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
not
the
whole
corpus,
no.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
certainly.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
the
last
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
the
last
date
--
day
of
each
month.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
i
suppose
those
are
--
i
think
that's
right.
you
take
the
value
as
of
the
last
day
of
each
month,
add
the
12
together,
get
the
total
and
divide
it
by
12
--
by
12
to
get
an
average
inventory
for
the
entire
year.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
right.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
what
you
get
is
the
exact
quantity
in
the
sense
after
all
is
the
dollar
value
of
the
ore
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
--
would
reflect
in
turn
the
number
of
tons
that
were
in
the
pile.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
normally
in
ohio,
january
first
of
this
time.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
no.
you
would
have
no
tax.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that's
right.
if
you
were
not
a
taxpayer
on
january
first.
i
would
have
to
answer
your
question
that
way.
if
you
are
not
a
taxpayer
on
january
first,
then
there
would
be
no
averaging
of
the
inventory.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
under
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court,
you
divide
it
by
12
as
long
as
your
in
business
even
though
you
have
inventory
only
two
or
three
months.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
isn't
our
case.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no
differentiation.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
either
we
agree
or
not,
we
don't
make
any
differentiation.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
even
--
even
more
than
that
as
i
will
develop
--
develop
my
point
to
make
it
in
to
the
argument,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
think
we
should
come
now
to
the
matter
of
domestic
storage
that
was
stored
on
lake
erie
docks
at
cleveland
and
ashtabula,
iron
ore
which
had
been
produced
in
the
united
states
and
which
would
be
ultimately
transported
to
youngstown
but
had
not
been
so
moved
on
tax
listing
day.
the
question
we
raised
there
is
whether
we
are
denied
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
that
--
that
same
ore
belonging
to
a
nonresident
would
be
exempted
from
taxation
while
our
ore,
of
a
resident,
is
held
taxable
for
the
year
1954.
now,
coming
to
the
argument.
we
start
off
first
to
the
proposition,
which
i
don't
think
is
challenged
by
the
state
that
imported
goods
in
original
packages
are
not
taxable
in
ohio.
so
that
brings
our
problem
down
to
the
question
as
to
whether
punishable
bulk
ores
are
to
be
treated
differently
than
packaged
goods.
we
say
of
course
that
there
can
be
no
distinction
because
the
ores
held
in
the
storage
yard
which
came
from
the
five
foreign
companies
named
were
in
the
same
form
in
which
they
were
imported.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
we
think
not
and
we
don't
believe
our
case
was
any
different
from
the
case
decided
by
this
court
in
--
in
1945,
the
hooven-allison
case.
we
don't
think
withdrawal
of
a
small
quantity
of
ore
from
a
pile
rendered
the
remainder
of
a
taxable.
we
--
we
concede
in
effect
that
when
you
take
a
portion
away
and
take
it
to
the
stock
houses
or
stock
bin
that
as
to
that
portion,
there's
a
taxable
income.
perhaps,
we
just
don't
argue
the
question,
but
as
to
the
remainder
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
--
we
say
that
taxability
is
not
created
by
the
removal
of
a
part.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
had
one
single
large
package
which
contained
a
number
of
smaller
packages
and
all
the
court
held
in
that
case
was
that
the
opening
of
the
larger
package
rendered
the
remaining
packages
were
then
the
large
package
taxable.
no
question
as
to
any
other
packages
which
might
have
been
in
the
possession
of
the
--
of
the
owner
in
that
case.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
correct.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
so
we
contend
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
should
be
no
distinction
drawn
between
packaged
goods
and
between
so-called
bulk
tangibles
such
as
iron
ore.
the
state
contends
and
we
reject
of
course
that
contention
that
when
we
add
a
shipment
of
identical
ore,
brazilian
ore
to
brazilian
ore
that
we
have
comingled,
we
obviously
have
not,
because
the
character
of
that
ore
has
not
changed
in
any
respect.
the
state
further
contends
that
when
we
withdraw
a
quantity
that
we
in
effect
had
broken
the
package.
there
are
only
two
cases
that
we
know
of.
one
is
the
stanton
case
in
california
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
other
is
the
--
i
believe
south
port
on
their
main
on
their
main
case
in
which
the
vessel
itself
is
held
to
be
the
package.
that
theory
has
not
been
followed
consistently
by
the
courts
in
this
country.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
we
say
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
--
very
simply
that
until
the
ore
is
put
to
the
use
for
which
it
was
imported
that
it
retains
its
constitutional
immunity.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
when
it
is
put
to
the
use
for
which
it
was
imported,
which
is
to
put
the
--
put
in
to
manufacturing.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
now
with
that,
do
you
mean
from
a
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
--
storage
yard
to
the
stock
bin?
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
we
didn't
raise
that
question.
but
--
we
didn't
raise
that
question
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
in
order
to
simplify
this
case,
but
only
to
contend
that
the
ores
in
the
storage
piles
were
immune
from
taxation.
if
you
were
to
follow
literally
the
language
of
the
case
hooven-allison
case,
the
immunity
is
not
lost
until
you
act
upon
the
ore
by
putting
it
in
to
the
manufacturing
process.
i
would
certainly
agree
that
at
that
point
the
immunity
is
lost.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
oh,
certainly,
all
ore
stored
will
ultimately
be
used
and
that
is
the
only
purpose
for
which
you
require
ore,
of
course.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
if
i
just
stored
imported
oil
and
put
it
away.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
claim
any
less
exemption
under
those
circumstances
or
exclusion
than
we
do
it
here.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
the
only
purpose
--
the
only
purpose
it
have
obviously
in
buying
the
ores
to
use
it
sometime.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
and
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
still
the
ultimate
purpose
would
be
“use.”
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
one
of
the
issue.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
one
of
the
issues
most
certainly,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
but
you
see,
we
have
accepted
as
principles
of
law
three
things
as
test
of
when
this
event
happened,
this
incident.
one
was
when
the
package
is
broken.
two,
when
the
property
is
put
to
the
use
for
which
it
was
acquired.
or
third,
when
it
is
sold.
otherwise,
you
have
great
difficulty
in
applying
any
practical
rule,
any
reasonable
rule
to
this
determination
that
i
think
is
of
concern
to
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
we
have
thought
not.
and
of
course
in
hooven
and
allison,
i
quote
that
case
again.
i
think
its
page
664.
i
believe
the
chief
justice
touched
on
the
very
point
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
import
was
stored
at
the
dock
or
at
--
at
the
place
where
it
would
be
ultimately
used.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
it's
stored
in
the
warehouse
at
the
plant,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
that's
--
i'm
not
trying
to
answer
your
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
i
said
i
didn't
think
it
made
any
difference
and
i
quoted
the
chief
justice's
remark
in
hooven
and
allison
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
at
the
dock
or
at
the
plant.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
sir.
the
constitutional
provision
itself
withdrew
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state's
imports.
and
if
we
are
to
assume
that
imports
are
to
be
taxable
under
the
circumstances
in
which
we
find
them
here,
then
there
is
no
immunity,
because
the
--
the
dock
in
the
place
of
manufacturing
might
be
coexistent.
it's
very
possible,
but
there
will
be
no
amenity
if
the
place
or
the
storage
does
not
have
some
bearing
on
the
whole
situation.
we
come
next
to
the
question
of
equal
protection
and
contend
there
that
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
on
equal
protection?
the
ohio
court
on
equal
protection
held
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
the
exception
from
taxation
because
we
were
a
domestic
corporation
or
resident
that
it
accorded
before.
that
was
because
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
i
recounted
before
said
this,
5701.08
you'll
find
at
the
end
of
your
brief,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
appellant's
brief.
the
section
says
in
effect
that
all
property
located,
all
personal
property
located
in
ohio
and
used
in
business
is
taxable.
that
includes
storage
in
the
language
of
the
section.
there
is
a
proviso,
but
property
belonging
to
a
nonresident,
held
for
storage
only
in
a
storage
warehouse
is
not
used
in
business
within
the
meaning
of
our
statute.
when
the
court
first
came
to
grips,
the
ohio
supreme
court
with
that
problem
back
in
general
cigar
versus
peck,
159
ohio
state
and
152,
there
was
a
contention
made
that
the
exception
of
the
property
of
nonresidents
from
taxation
would
operate
adversely
to
the
resident
and
the
judge
of
our
court
wrote
the
opinion,
judge
taft
said
that
that
was
a
matter
for
the
general
assembly,
not
a
matter
for
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
that
statute
has
subsequently
been
construed
in
two
more
cases.
and
that
in
general,
the
same
--
same
result
reached
that
the
storage
of
a
nonresident
is
exempted
from
taxation,
but
that
the
storages
of
residents
are
to
be
included
for
tax
purposes,
specifically
so
held
in
youngstown
and
in
the
allied
case
which
followed
the
youngstown
case.
so,
we
do
had
this
statute,
which
was
in
effect
until
september
30,
1955
which
on
one
hand
except
the
property
of
a
nonresident
and
taxes
the
property
of
the
residents.
a
classification
based
solely
upon
residents
and
having
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
character
of
the
property
itself.
because
under
identical
circumstances,
the
property
of
the
nonresident
would
be
exempted
under
the
old
statute
and
the
property
of
the
resident
taxed
and
that's
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
oh,
we
think
of
course,
you
ought
to
strike
the
language
belonging
to
a
nonresident.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
yes,
as
to
--
as
to
a
nonresident.
so
it's
a
valid
classification.
but
in
applying
a
tax
under
other
language
of
the
same
section
to
the
resident,
they're
denying
the
resident
equal
protection.
there
is
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
there
--
there
is
no
nonresident
before
this
court.
that's
right.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
in
the
nonresident
cases,
the
point
was
brought
to
the
court
that
this
would
result
in
the
discrimination
against
the
resident.
the
court
said
that's
a
matter
for
the
general
assembly,
not
for
the
courts.
in
the
allied
and
youngstown
cases,
the
court
did
not
grant
us
relief
nor
did
it
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
so
far
as
it
affected
us,
so
as
to
produce
the
result
that
you
indicated.
our
contention
quite
frankly
is
this,
that
this
court
could
not
strike
down
the
exemptions
of
a
nonresident
because
that
would
produce
the
result
of
levying
a
tax.
and
nonresidents
in
ohio
have
been
exempted
by
the
language
of
the
statute
from
taxation
since
1932
and
to
and
including
september
13,
1955.
there
was
an
old
case
in
this
court,
115
u.s.
in
which
the
court
said
that
it
was
not
a
tax
levying
body,
that
it
would
not
levy
a
tax
and
that
particularly
the
federal
courts
would
found
upon
the
levy
of
a
tax
upon
the
states.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
the
court
has
not
held
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
oh,
we
--
we
have
not
contend
that
it
certainly
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
residents
and
nonresidents
stand
alike
in
ohio
with
respect
to
the
personal
property
tax
except
for
the
exception
which
excludes
the
agricultural
products
and
merchandise
held
for
storage
only.
and
that
was
so
only
to
september
30,
1955.
since
that
time,
there's
another
statute
on
the
books
which
treats
residents
and
nonresidents
alike
with
respect
to
storage.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
in
1954,
which
is
the
year
in
issue.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
and
we
were
denied
the
same
privilege
because
we
were
residents.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no.
no,
the
court
never
said
that.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
correct.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
some
other
people
are
not
included,
that
is
right.
an
identical
property
under
identical
circumstance.
i
think
that
will
be
brought
out
more
clearly
if
i
--
i
come
to
the
allied
case
where
we
have
only
the
question
of
equal
protection.
allied
--
allied
stores
operates
four
department
stores
in
ohio,
in
the
cities
of
cleveland,
akron,
columbus
and
cincinnati
and
each
of
those
cities
that
has
warehouses.
they
are
a
distance
away
from
the
stores
as
the
stipulation
will
show
in
the
record.
and
from
time
to
time,
goods
are
transported
from
the
warehouses
to
the
retail
stores
and
sold
from
that
place.
now,
if
allied
or
the
nonresidents
under
the
law
prior
to
september
30,
1955,
that
particular
type
of
warehousing
of
merchandise
would
be
exempted
from
taxation.
but
because
allied
is
a
domestic
and
ohio
corporation,
it
is
subjected
to
a
tax.
precisely
the
same
problem
as
in
youngstown,
except
for
the
difference
in
the
activities
of
the
two
taxpayers.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
not
at
that
time.
no,
sir.
all
foreigns
were
treated
the
same.
all
nonresidents
were
treated
the
same.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
that
is
right.
the
only
difference
the
statute
would
provide
would
be
the
difference
of
residents,
they'd
have
two
stores.
one
on
one
side
of
the
street
and
one
on
the
other
doing
the
same
kind
of
business
with
the
same
type
of
clientele.
one
would
be
taxable
because
it
was
a
resident
and
the
nonresident
would
have
the
exception
because
of
it's
a
nonresidents.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
i
don't
think
it's
a
valid
classification
when
you're
taxing
property
to
make
your
classification
rest
upon
the
mere
matter
of
residents.
here
are
people
identically
situated.
they
having
competing
stores,
one
across
the
street
from
the
other.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
well,
as
i've
said,
our
position
simply
is
that
it
isn't
a
valid
classification
to
treat,
when
you're
taxing
property
to
base
upon
the
treatment
of
nonresidents.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
you're
treating
everyone
on
that
--
in
the
class
the
same,
including
all
veterans.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
but
you're
taxing
property
and
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
the
court
please.
mr.
carlton
s.
dargusch,
sr.
if
the
taxpayer
youngstown
was
a
nonresident,
it
would
clearly
follow
that
the
ore
on
lake
eerie
docks,
at
cleveland
and
ashtabula
would've
have
been
exempted
from
taxation
on
view
of
the
statute.
we
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
wheeling
steel
case,
337
u.s.
562,
in
which
this
court
held
that
residents
is
not
a
valid
basis
for
classification.
that
was
a
property
tax
case
and
the
wheeling
steel
corporation
in
that
instance
was
a
nonresident
corporation
of
ohio
being
incorporated
in
another
state
that
qualified
to
do
business
in
ohio.
they
reiterate
in
connection
with
equal
protection
that
the
court
should
not
strike
the
exemption
in
5701.08,
the
court
of
nonresidents
for
the
reason
stated
before
that
the
court
does
not
have
the
authority
to
levy
a
tax.
and
the
effect
of
course
would
be
to
levy
a
tax.
the
attorney
general
recognizes
that.
we
might
have
some
dispute
as
to
the
period
that
would
be
covered
because
of
many
instances
these
cases
are
open
for
quite
a
few
years
back.

yes,
sir.
on
the
import
question,
we
have
not
been
talking
about
package.
they
merely
used
the
illustration
of
the
breaking
of
a
package
as
an
occasion
when
the
property
would
cease
to
be
an
import.
we
didn't
want
to
imply
that
our
iron
ore
was
in
any
sense
a
package.
we've
been
talking
about
form
in
that
instance.
and
so
long,
the
import
is
in
its
original
form,
in
storage
and
has
not
been
acted
upon,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
import
retains
its
immunity
under
the
constitution.
we
think
it's
most
important
that
this
matter
of
the
immunity
of
imports
continue
to
be
one
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
the
founding
father
certainly
had
some
purpose
when
they
wrote

as
strongly
as
they
did,
"no

except
as
maybe
needed
for
its
inspection
laws.
absolutely
necessary
for
that
purpose,
levy
any
tax
imposed
to
duty
on
an
import.
we
reiterate
again
that
the
mere
removal
of
a
portion
of
a
total
shipment
does
not
render
the
remainder
taxable.
