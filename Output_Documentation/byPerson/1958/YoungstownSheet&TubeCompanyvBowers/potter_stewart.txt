justice
potter
stewart
well,
tell
me
mr.
state
general,
what
would
--
if
that
was
done,
would
there
--
would
that
be
some
other
provision
which
would
subject
nonresidents'
property
to
taxation?
would
that
fall
under
01,
for
example?
if
--
if
this
--
if
you
drop
the
proviso?
justice
potter
stewart
unnecessary
because
it
can't
be
that
the
--
if
you
delete
this
provision
as
invalid,
no
other
provision
which
provides
for
the
assessment
of
nonresident
property
as
i
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
tobin,
i
--
i
don't
know
if
i
understood
you
correctly.
do
your
emphasis
on
the
comingling
of
these
shipments
indicative
that
you
feel
that
if
they
were
not
commingled,
that
is
that
a
separate
pile
were
made
of
each
shipment
as
it
arrived,
that
it
would
be
only
the
individual
piles
that
were
disturbed
in
the
sense
of
having
some
drawing
from
them
for
the
use
of
the
manufacturing
practice
that
ohio
would
be
able
to
tax
and
that
those
that
were
undisturbed
of
the
individual
piles
could
not
be
taxed?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
the
only
purpose
for
bringing
in
this
type
of
ore
to
use
them
in
connectin
with
the
manufacturing
process
and
even
though
within
the
three
month
period,
they
would
in
fact
be
used
in
the
manufacturing
process.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
because
you
felt
so
much
out
of
the
original
packaging
docked?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
to
the
veneers,
there
was
no
intention
and
certainly
no
finding
that
anything
happened
in
--
so
far
as
the
production
process
and
that
probably
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
larkin
--
justice
potter
stewart
lumber
could
be
air-dried
or
kiln-dried
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
a
fact
that
it
always
is
kiln-dried?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
all
lumber
at
least
to
this
type
are
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
kiln-dried.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
also,
mr.
larkin,
the
basis
on
which
the
dissenting
judges
--
partially
dissenting
judges,
it
wasn't
the
basis
of
which
they
concurred
in
taxing
lumber
