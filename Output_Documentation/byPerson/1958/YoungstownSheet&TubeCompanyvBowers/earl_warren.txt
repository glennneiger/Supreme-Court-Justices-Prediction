they

chief

i
--
i
didn't
quite
get
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
question.
will
you
say,
it
could
not
be
there
for
five
years.
what
did
you
understand
his
question
to
--
to
be
and
what
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
you'd
have
another
pile,
supposed
you
had
--
instead
of
having
one
pile
for
each
nation,
you
had
two
piles
and
in
one
pile,
you
--
you
put
--
you
--
in
one
pile,
you
left
there
for
five
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
other
pile,
you
--
you
kept
more
or
less
current
as
you
do
in
this
one
thereby
moving
it
out
through
the
mills.
would
you
claim
exemption
on
the
other
pile
was
there
for
five
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
difference
between
the
two
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
--
in
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
challenge
on
that
ground?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
a
--
if
you
had
a
thousands
tons
of
the
ore
in
this
pile
on
the
taxable
date,
but
you
had
used
a
hundred
thousand
tons
during
the
year
from
this
--
from
this
stockpile,
you
would
be
taxed
just
on
the
thousand
tons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
dargusch,
at
what
point
--
at
what
point
do
you
concede
that
it
loses
its
exemption
as
an
import?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
at
what
point
in
the
putting
it
to
be
manufactured?
do
you
concede
that
moving
it
from
the
one
pile
to
the
other
pile
destroys
the
exemption?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
--
chief
justice

to
the
stock
bin,
yes.
do
--
does
that
break
up
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
--
do
you
--
or
do
you
stand
on
that
--
that
position
that
that's
the
breaking
point?

mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief

earl
warren
was
it
equally
available
for
processing
the
moment
it
arrived
there
with
the
time
at
--
let's
say
after
it
had
been
there
a
couple
of
months
for
drying
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
therefore
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
therefore,
the
expense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
was
--
and
i
suppose,
they
were
kept
in
separate
packages
for
--
for
that
reason
among
others,
to
determine
how
long
they
--
they
would
be
there
until
used?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
get
a
distinction
between
the
veneer
and
the
lumber
as
to
its
taxability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
--
we
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
--
that
the
lumber
was
taxable
that
it
--
that
it
followed
that
we
would
have
to
hold
that
the
veneer
was
taxable
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
always
omit
the
distinction
from
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
misunderstood
you.
you
do
make
a
distinction
that
we
could
--
we
could
decide
one
way
as
for
the
lumber
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
other
way
as
to
the
veneer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
--
chief

earl
warren
we'll

mr.

had
you
completed
your
thought
of
the
argument?
chief

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice

warren
you
may.
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
i
understood
counsel
yesterday,
if
this
aerated
process
was
indulged
in,
it
was
cheaper
to
--
in
the
--
cheaper
at
the
end
to
dried
kiln
because
it
wouldn't
take
--
chief

warren
--
so
long,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice

warren
yes.
chief
justice
