mr.
william
saxbe
may
it
please
the
court.
in
as
much
as
there
are
two
divisions
here.
one,
regarding
the
imports
and
one
regarding
the
equal
protection,
i
request
permission
to
divide
the
time.
i
will
discuss
the
matter
of
the
equal
protection,
my
associate
mr.
tobin
will
discuss
the
matter
of
imports.
knowing
your
interest
in
the
fact
and
the
background
on
this,
i
feel
it
is
important
that
i
go
to
the
background
of
this
tax
that
we're
discussing,
the
statute
in
regard
to
residents
and
nonresidents.
up
until
1931,
ohio
was
part
--
was
known
as
a
general
tax
state.
at
that
time,
they
adopted
the
classified
tax
and
distinguished
between
personal
property
used
in
business
and
other
personal
property.
in
other
words,
we
have
no
tax
upon
household
goods,
jewelry,
clothing
as
i
know
you
understand
many
states
do.
we
only
tax
personal
property
that
is
used
in
business.
and
so
at
that
time,
they
proceeded
to
set
out
in
a
special
statute
which
you
have
already
observed,
what's
used
in
business
meant.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
and
--
no,
that
--
08
was
the
amendment,
that
was
later
amended
and
that's
what
i
will
refer
to.
but
in
1931,
they
passed
that
and
there
was
nothing
in
there
about
a
nonresident.
it
applied
generally
to
every
property
used
in
business,
all
personal
property.
ohio
was
an
important
terminal
state,
cincinnati
specially,
tremendous
warehouses,
green,
it's
the
terminal
of
the
southern
railroad,
the
terminal
of
many
western
railroads,
green
whiskey
manufactured
good
was
in
cincinnati.
toledo
is
another
terminal,
cleveland.
so
these
people
were
being
hurt
and
they
asked
that
the
provision
be
put
in.
i
think
it
was
authored
by
robert
a.
taft
who
was
a
member
of
the
senate
at
that
time.
it
was
put
in
to
encourage
business
to
come
to
ohio.
and
that
provision
as
provision
as
you
recall
says,
"that
merchandise
or
agricultural
products
belonging
to
a
nonresident
of
this
state
is
not
used
in
business
in
this
state.
it
held
a
storage
warehouse
for
storage
only."
and
that
was
for
the
purposes
of
attracting
business
and
of
course,
filling
the
warehouse
that
it
--
it
did.
now,
the
tax
commissioner
in
the
board
of
tax
appeals
for
many
years
interpreted
nonresident
as
meaning,
a
person
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
ohio.
we
have
tax
laws
in
ohio
in
regard
to
corporations
where
you
must
commend
to
qualify,
make
yourself
subject
to
service
to
the
secretary
of
state
or
statutory
agent.
this
was
interpreted
as
meaning
a
nonresident
as
one
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
ohio.
and
the
persons
who
did
business
in
ohio
of
course
have
to
be
licensed
with
our
secretary
of
state,
recognized
as
a
corporation
or
an
individual
doing
business.
this
proceeded
for
a
number
of
years
and
the
tax
commissioner
assessed
that.
a
nonresident
meant
just
that.
you've
heard
here
today
of
the
goodrich
case.
in
that
case
which
was
raised
in
1953,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
first
going
up
to
the
tax
commission.
but
the
supreme
court
in
ohio
was
asked
to
say
that
nonresident
in
this
statute
meant
a
person
who
--
well,
literally
just
a
nonresident,
one
who
was
not
incorporated
in
ohio.
and
they
held
that
and
they
held
that
good
year
stores
--
goodrich
stores
in
ohio
that
bought
merchandise
in
bulk
and
shipped
it
in
and
stored
it
before
moving
it
into
their
stores
could
do
that
without
paying
tax
because
they
were
nonresidents.
naturally,
this
caused
quite
a
bit
of
confusion
in
the
ohio
tax
picture,
and
this
case
today
results
from
that.
change
in
the
a
law
results
from
that
which
you
referred
to
the
fact
1955.
there
is
about
a
dozen
other
cases
which
are
pending
back
in
ohio.
in
other
words,
once
the
lid
was
off
in
this
goodrich
case,
then
everyone
scrambled
to
make
the
most
out
of
an
interpretation
of
a
law
which
have
been
lying
there
quietly
for
25
years,
not
molested
by
the
idea
that
the
state
address
was
a
particular
thing
that
made
them
a
nonresident.
well,
then
these
dozen
cases
came
in
and
the
allied
case
was
one
of
those.
and
they
said
they're
doing
business
as
department
stores.
we're
on
this
corner.
here
is
a
domestic
corporation
on
this
corner.
there
is
no
difference.
we
claim
that
we
are
denied
equal
protection
under
the
law.
now,
ohio
then
changed
the
law
so
that
--
that
it
was
stricken
out
and
we're
discussing
now
a
period
from
about
1951
until
the
law
was
changed
in
1955.
we
have
a
four-year
statute,
but
we
also
have
some
open
cases
by
a
waiver
that
go
longer
than
the
four-year
period.
in
this
period
of
confusion
has
been
the
discussion
in
the
center
of
this
number
of
cases
that
i'm
reading
here
today.
now,
the
assumption
being
that
equal
protection
is
denied,
they
can
move
directly
into
the
idea
that
the
only
way
to
correct
that
is
for
ohio
to
say
to
the
residents,
the
domestics,
"you
shall
receive
the
same
question
and
you
shall
receive
the
same
exemption
as
of
nonresident."
i
might
point
out
further
that
personal
property
tax
in
ohio
is
a
local
situs
tax.
in
other
words,
it
is
collected
by
the
county
and
distributed
by
the
county.
it
does
not
come
to
the
state.
and
so,
in
the
several
counties
of
the
state
where
these
cases
are
involved,
there
is
involved
a
several
millions
of
dollars
that
has
been
withheld,
determined
it
--
concerning
a
determination
of
this
case.
we
had
felt
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision
had
settled
it,
because
i
differ
in
the
opinion
of
my
good
friend
general
dargusch.
i
do
feel
that
our,
judge
taft,
who
wrote
this
opinion
did
say
exactly
what
you
suggested
that
if
there
was
a
discrimination
that
the
allied
stores
were
in
no
position
to
raise
it.
in
other
words,
they
could
not
benefit
by
raising
the
issue
of
discrimination
because
it
meant
that
they
would
throw
out
the
exemption
granted
the
nonresidents
by
application
of
our
statutory
rule
in
ohio
which
says
that
you
cannot
take
apart
a
certain
organic
part
of
a
--
of
a
statute.
and
in
that
attitude,
he
said
this,
"ordinarily
a
constitutional
question
will
not
be
considered
unless
it
is
necessary
to
consider
such
constitutional
question
in
deciding
the
case
before
the
court."
in
our
opinion,
it
is
not
necessary
to
consider
the
constitutional
question
raised
for
the
taxpayer
in
the
incident
case.
because
if
its
contention
with
regard
to
the
question
is
sound,
it
necessarily
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
entire
proviso
in
subdivision
a
of
section
5701.08
which
reads
so
on
and
so
on,
would
be
taxable
because
it
is
described
by
the
word
--
preceding
words
remaining
in
the
statute
and
ending,
“stored
as
merchandise.”
in
other
words,
judge
taft
said,
"if
i
strike
this
entire
section
which
was
put
in
by
amendment
two
years
after
the
original
statute,
i
would
in
effect
put
you
out
of
court
because
you
would
have
no
claim
to
benefit
by
them."
in
other
words,
the
allied
stores
could
only
bring
the
tax
upon
the
nonresident.
they
could
not
remove
it
from
themselves.
mr.
william
saxbe
well,
i
don't
believed
so
because
under
the
statutory
construction
in
ohio,
in
our
section
of
the
revised
code,
it
holds
that
a
--
where
a
part
of
a
statute
is
found
unconstitutional,
only
the
unconstitutional
part
can
be
removed
or
should
be
removed.
mr.
william
saxbe
that's
right.
and
this
--
mr.
william
saxbe
--
definitely
is
severable
because
it
was
put
in
two
years
after
the
original
statute
was
written.
now,
the
--
mr.
william
saxbe
that
was
the
--
mr.
william
saxbe
it
better
is.
it
is
possible
and
certainly
--
mr.
william
saxbe
that's
right.
mr.
william
saxbe
that
was
his
suggestion,
sir,
but
it
was
not
his
intention.
mr.
william
saxbe
he
raised
that
only
because
he
said
this
would
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
saxbe
no,
sir.
mr.
william
saxbe
no,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
this,
that
i
think
that
the
appellants
have
moved
too
fast
to
the
idea
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
discrimination.
i
feel
that
under
the
cases
of
this
court,
under
the
cases
quoted
in
our
brief,
state
board
of
tax
commissioners
of
indiana
versus
jackson
and
others
that
the
state
can
make
discrimination.
and
as
long
as
it
is
not
completely
arbitrary,
i
certainly
feel
that
in
1933,
when
the
legislature
amended
the
original
bill
which
established
the
classified
personal
property
tax
that
they
did
so
with
the
definite
intention
to
attract
business
to
ohio
warehouses
and
attract
business
to
ohio
generally.
mr.
william
saxbe
sir,
i
can
only
say
this
and
that
is
that
distinction
was
established
by
the
court
and
not
the
legislature.
and
once
it
was
established
by
the
court,
the
legislature
moved
quickly
to
reaffirm
their
original
intention.
the
original
intention
as
stated
by
the
legislature
at
that
time
and
the
one
that
stood
up
for
20
years
was
that
a
nonresident
referred
to
a
person
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
ohio.
in
other
words,
the
person
who
was
shipping
stuff
for
storage
only.
then
in
1930
or
1953,
when
the
goodrich
case
was
handed
down
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
and
for
the
first
time,
the
court
made
an
artificial
distinction
by
saying
that
a
nonresident
didn't
only
mean
a
person
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
ohio
as
the
tax
commissioner
have
previously
determined,
but
it
meant
everyone
who
is
a
nonresident.
then
the
legislature
moved
and
the
present
statute
reads
that
the
person
who
is
exempted
is
one
who
moves
material
into
ohio
for
the
purpose
of
storage
and
then
thereafter,
moves
it
out.
so
we
do
have
the
true
picture
today.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
saxbe
that
is
--
mr.
william
saxbe
i
agree
to
that.
and
i
say
this
that
during
that
period,
we
must
fall
back
on
the
original
powers
of
the
legislature
to
have
completely
discriminate
if
they
wanted
to.
in
other
words,
if
the
legislature
--
mr.
william
saxbe
yes.
it
is
under
our
concept
because
we
thereafter
changed
it.
but
--
mr.
william
saxbe
i
--
mr.
william
saxbe
i
had
first
--
mr.
william
saxbe
but,
sir,
i'd
like
to
say
that
that
was
between
1953
and
1955
during
which
period
of
time
there
was
no
meaning
of
our
legislature.
mr.
william
saxbe
that's
right,
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
william
saxbe
like
i
say,
the
law
was
changed
and
became
effective
september
30
of
1955.
our
law
goes
back
four
years
in
ohio.
however,
there
were
some
open
years
by
waiver
that
continued
further
back.
so
i
presume
that
it
would
go
back
as
far
as
1951.
now,
this
was
not
in
general
--
generally
raised
point.
most
of
the
residents
continued
to
pay
and
only
a
few
raised
it.
we
--
mr.
william
saxbe
no,
sir.
i
don't
feel
it's
quite
like
that.
here
is
what
has
happened.
when
the
goodrich
case
blew
the
lid
off,
so
to
speak,
everyone
was
scrambling
after
a
tax
advantage
because
of
this
distinction.
they
were
met
head
on
by
saying,
even
if
this
was
the
intent
back
in
1931,
they
could
have
done
it
because
there
is
a
reasonable
distinction.
in
other
words,
a
nonresident
is
a
nonresident
and
you
can
favor
him
if
you
want
his
business.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
saxbe
we've
got
to
meet
that.
but
then
we
proceed
on
further,
supposed
that
the
court
would
say
under
the
goodrich
case,
this
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
law
and
what
can
we
do
to
correct
that.
you
wind
up
right
exactly
back
with
judge
taft
in
the
ohio
case
when
he
says,
"we
cannot
correct
this
by
simply
taking
off
the
tax
that
the
ohio
residents
have
paid."
that
is
not
corrected.
neither
can
we
correct
it
by
saying
that
we
are
going
to
tax
the
nonresidents
who
have
enjoyed
the
exemption.
the
alternative
is
to
say
that
there
may
possibly
be
a
denial
under
the
goodrich
case.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
a
better
solution
and
that
is
to
properly
reconstruct
the
statute
as
it
existed
and
before
the
goodrich
case.
mr.
william
saxbe
i
might
say
that
in
regard
to
the
--
mr.
william
saxbe
--
to
the
murray
case.
mr.
william
saxbe
i
only
suggest
that
because
i
do
believe
that
this
court
can,
when
directly
interested
in
making
a
statute
workable,
can
bring
some
order
out
of
chaos.
and
i
think
that
in
regard
to
this,
we
have
a
situation
developed
by
dicta,
so
to
speak,
where
the
real
intent
is
obscured.
mr.
william
saxbe
i'm
glad
he
is
not
here.[laughter]
but
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
wiser
--
the
wiser
role
would
be
to
follow.
the
opinion
of
judge
taft
in
this
present
case
where
he
says,
“we
cannot
proceed
to
deny
the
tax
that
has
already
been
collected.”
and
certainly,
i'm
talking
about
domestics.
we
cannot
take
this
amendment
and
knock
out
only
this
much
of
it
to
a
nonresident
of
this
state
and
that's
what
they
suggested
(inaudible).
but
simply
says
that
if
we
knock
any
of
it
out,
we
must
knockout
the
position
put
in
to
this
--
the
--
mr.
william
saxbe
--
proviso
put
in
by
the
amendment
of
1933.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir,
it
would,
because
in
there
previously
--
mr.
william
saxbe
there
is
a
provision
and
a
statute
that
would
be
found
in
the
rear
of
our
brief.
i
believe
it's
in
the
rear
of
our
brief.
i've
put
that
one.
mr.
william
saxbe
it's
all
personal
property
located
and
used
in
business
in
this
state
and
all
domestic
animals
kept
in
the
state
whether
or
not
used
in
business
are
subject
to
taxation
regardless
of
the
owners
thereof.
mr.
william
saxbe
that's
01.
mr.
william
saxbe
well,
that
is
--
mr.
william
saxbe
--
why
"used",
i
believe,
the
--
you
cannot
strike
the
entire
statute
because
"used"
is
necessary
to
point
out
exactly
how
the
business
or
what
business
is
used
or
what
material
as
personal
property
is
used.
mr.
william
saxbe
it
is
used
and
we
have
a
further
distinction
on
that,
a
case,
one
of
a
dozen
that
i
mentioned
called
the
grinnell
case.
mr.
william
saxbe
the
grinnell
case
was
--
the
one
i'm
speaking
off
is
the
first
case.
mr.
william
saxbe
that
is
the
one
that
points
out
conditions
necessary
for
use
in
business.
that
is
one
of
interest
in
regard
to
the
or
on
the
dock
situation
and
has
modified
that
which
my
associate
will
bring
up.
the
grinnell
case
has
modified
the
considerations
of
the
use
in
business,
so
that
there
would
be
difficulty
of
application
in
regard
to
the
use
in
business
against
a
nonresident.
but
i
certainly
have
no
desire
to
suggest
that
those
people
who
have
been
attracted
into
ohio
under
the
exemption
as
put
in
08
originally.
now,
the
tax
to
bring
equality
or
so-called
equality
to
the
domestic.
mr.
william
saxbe
the
ohio
court
did
not.
they
did
not
apply
that
and
there
has
been
no
attempt
made
to
proceed
under
that
and
we
thought
that
it
was
a
solomon
like
decision
that
the
exemption
should
not
continue.
however,
it
was
corrected
by
statute.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes.
mr.
william
saxbe
i
--
i
feel
this
way,
mr.
justice
black,
and
that
is
this,
that
we
do
not
admit
that
the
ruling
even
under
the
goodrich
case
makes
this
an
arbitrary
distinction.
we
maintain
and
our
brief
points
out
that
ohio
has
the
power
to
make
a
distinction
in
taxation
even
though
it
must
live
up
to
the
rule
as
set
down
in
the
goodrich
case.
first,
you're
dealing
with
a
nonresident.
you're
in
a
better
position
to
collect
from
a
resident,
certainly.
you
are
desirous
of
attracting
a
nonresident
and
such
desire
has
been
recognized
and
there
are
other
reasons
that
a
nonresident
is
different.
mr.
william
saxbe
i
think
you
would
have
to
waive
that
on
the
benefits
that
you
received
by
attracting.
mr.
william
saxbe
no,
sir.
i
know
they
do.
we
--
we
do
not,
but
we
do
have
similar
circumstances
where
a
municipality
will
actually
build
a
factory
and
invite
a
man
in
tax
free
to
occupy
that
factory.
mr.
william
saxbe
on
your
railroad.
mr.
william
saxbe
and
that's
why
i
say
that
even
if
the
state
had
--
have
the
worst
to
consider
under
the
goodrich
decision,
it
still
has
the
arbitrary
--
not
arbitrary,
but
the
power
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
saxbe
sir?
mr.
william
saxbe
it
is
and
i
only
proceed
--
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.[laughter]
i
feel
that
that
is
the
basic
answer.
and
secondly,
i
want
to
say
that
--
mr.
william
saxbe
well
--
mr.
william
saxbe
i
feel
that
that
is
the
basis.
the
--
frankly,
when
this
came
out
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
we
felt
that
it
was
a
decision
that
would
properly
end
this
litigation.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
saxbe
not
in
the
record,
sir.
mr.
william
saxbe
i'm
quite
sure
that
there
is
because
of
our
big
warehousing
facilities
in
cincinnati
and
toledo,
and
cleveland.
and
at
the
same
time
when
this
new
statute
was
passed
in
1955,
those
same
people
ran
the
legislature
to
again
put
in
the
words
specifically
“warehousing.”
and
--
mr.
william
saxbe
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
it
--
i
wish
that
there
were
a
material
in
the
record.
i
will
say
directly
myself
that
it
has
worked.
i
would
like
to
say
this
before
i
turn
over
to
my
associate
and
that's
this
simply.
we
are
anxious
as
you
consider
this
on
the
grounds
that
ohio
has
the
power
to
make
a
distinction
in
our
most
important
parts
of
our
brief,
point
out
the
various
opinions
which
bear
out
the
power
of
a
state
to
do
that.
secondly,
the
very
fact
that
this
case
was
admitted
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
made
us
more
anxious
to
move
in
to
the
realm
open
if
you
should
find
that
there
was
an
arbitrary
discrimination.
and
frankly,
the
arguments
that
i
have
made
here
in
regard
to
this
have
been
raised
that
you
would
not
have
admitted
the
case
had
there
not
been
some
danger
of
moving
into
that
realm.
and
in
as
much
as
their
entire
case
defended
not
only
first
upon
finding
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
but
secondly,
they
must
also
find
that
the
approach
of
justice
taft
was
wrong.
and
third,
you
must
then
positively
find
that
the
only
way
that
you
can
bring
them
relief
is
to
legislate
a
tax
exemption
for
domestics
in
ohio.
now,
i
admit
that
we
have
gone
way
around
behind
the
bar
to
meet
the
argument,
but
we
do
so
simply
because
their
arguments
start
there.
and
we
must,
to
meet
them,
proceed
through
the
obvious,
to
the
difficult.
mr.
william
saxbe
the
amended
statute,
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
--
mr.
william
saxbe
the
amended
statute
today
says
that
of
course
the
same
general
statute
apply.
but,
nonresidents
who
move
goods
into
the
state
for
storage
or
--
or
warehousing
and
thereafter
move
them
out
of
the
state
are
exempt
in
taxation.
mr.
william
saxbe
it
is
limited
specifically
to
warehousing
so
that
it
will
not
thereafter
arise.
