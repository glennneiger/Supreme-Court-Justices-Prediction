justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
sir,
was
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
one
day
supply
or
more
than
one
day
supply
that
would
be
moved
from
the
piles
to
these
bins
within
the
--
the
mill
at
one
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there's
some
mark
of
it
(inaudible)
might
be
therefore
in
the
brief,
is
that
possible?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
it
clearly
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
this
storage
yard,
where
the
ores
are
kept
in
(inaudible)
pile
and
is
that
yard
continuous
to
the
mill?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
you
have
many
operations
in
the
mill,
was
it?
you
don't
get
this
back.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
your
statute
got
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
the
obstruction
couldn't
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
your
system
in
ohio,
inventories
are
reported
at
the
end
of
each
month
and
then
the
aggregates
was
divided
by
12
and
that's
the
amount?
that's
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
do
use
--
you
told
about
each
pile
in
your
normal
processes
every
day.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
when
you
made
daily
use
of
the
pile.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
otherwise
then
by
putting
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
within
that
form,
the
ultimate
disposition
by
the
importer
would
be
made.
isn't
that
--
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
is
this,
this
case
if
it
is
stored
for
the
purpose
of
being
used
in
the
normal
processes
as
a
(inaudible)
would
that
be
put?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
isn't
the
question,
when
did
it
become
a
part
of
the
general
mass
of
the
property?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
know
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
and
that
would
be
(inaudible)
altogether
apart
from
[laughs]
the
package,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
has
it
not
lost
its
character
as
an
import
when
it
is
put
in
the
yard
from
which
they
used
in
acquiring
the
old
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
a
very
different
case
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
at
the
plant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
find
some
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
this
was
(inaudible)
that
if
there
was
a
denial
of
these
exemptions
to
residents,
then
they
would
strike
down
the
exemption
as
to
nonresident
rather
than
to
hold
invalid
the
--
the
residential
plight
on
equal
protection
to
residents.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
my
question
wasn't
--
could
they
legally
do
what
they
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
was
no
claim
before
them
--
in
these
cases
by
any
nonresident
of
the
denial
of
equal
protection,
was
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
how
could
you
quite
say
in
denying
that
the
statute
denied
you
the
protection
on
the
basis
that
if
they
had
this
question
to
be
raised
by
nonresident,
they
would
go
--
that
would
--
the
statute
was
invalid
as
to
(inaudible)
i
don't
get
this
in
my
head.
i
do
not
see
a
difference.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
(inaudible)
constitution
not
--
the
legislative
power
was
not
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
anybody
could
strike
that
with
the
exemption
statute,
exempting
nonresidents.
would
it
be
--
the
--
the
legislature
at
least
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
know,
but
--
but
you
--
before
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
think
that
is
arbitrary
and
the
only
difference
is
the
residents
on
the
one
hand,
nonresidents
on
the
other?
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
about
the
murray
case?
[laughter]
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
01.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wouldn't
catch
this
because
of
the
word
"use"
in
the
state.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
condemn
the
property
in
storage
admittedly
in
a
public
warehouse
is
used?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
last
one
now,
the
167
--
you
got
two
grinnell
cases
out
there,
haven't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
first
one.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
isn't
that
what
the
court
--
the
ohio
court
view
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
i
think
it's
a
lot
better
one.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
in
the
one
of
attempting
to
defend
the
basis
on
which
the
ohio
court
put
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand,
what
they
really
said
was
this,
granted
there
is
the
unequal
protection
of
the
law,
yet
this
domestic
corporation
cannot
raise
it
or
if
we
have
the
question
raised
here
by
a
nonresident,
we
would
hold
the
exemption
invalidized
to
it.
and
that
to
me
is
not
a
good
basis,
but
the
one
you
have
mentioned
though
i
think
is
otherwise.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
they
contend,
mr.
tobin,
that
any
part
of
the
pile
should
have
different
treatment
on
the
whole
pile
until
some
part
had
been
removed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
except
that
there
is
maybe
one
of
the
elements
that
might
aid
(inaudible)
whether
or
not
the
property
is
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
--
when
does
the
package
arrive?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
the
goods
or
the
package
arrived.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
put
--
if
i
may
ask
you
this.
do
you
put
any
determinants
about
the
language
of
5701.08
as
defining
a
reasonable
termination
point
for
the
import
when
it
says
first
the
01
taxes
property
used.
08
says
that
property
used
means
when
employed
or
utilized
in
ordinary
operations
when
kept
and
maintained
as
a
part
of
a
plant
capable
of
operation
or
when
stored
or
kept
on-hand
as
material
parts,
products
or
merchandize.
now,
does
--
when
it's
kept
on-hand
as
a
material
at
the
plant,
do
--
for
use
at
the
plant,
do
you
think
ohio
thereby
has
reasonably
codified
that
point
at
which
it
became
a
part
of
the
local
mass
of
property
and
subjected
to
taxation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
does
that
mark
that
this
term,
the
(inaudible)
limit
at
which
time
the
property
will
also
be
carried
to
as
an
import?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
(inaudible)
unconstitutional
on
that
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
claim
that
there's
some
constitutionality
as
a
from
of
the
denial
of
equal
protection.that's
the
only
thing
about
constitutionality
to
waive,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
that's
when
the
claim
made
by
youngstown
of
unconstitutionality
of
08?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
08.

client
of
youngstown

right
to

e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
ohio
(voice

but
not
as

for
use
by
a
youngstown
plant
or
warehouse
over
that
fuel,
isn't
that
right?

is
that?

do
you
think
the

saying
that
perhaps
the

might
have
been
