mr.
edwin
larkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
remarks
of
mr.
minahan
yesterday
on
the
first
subject
that
he
took
up
which
has
to
do
with
the
lumber
imported
and
piled
in
the
yard
in
algoma.
and
algoma
is
about
150
miles
north
of
milwaukee.
and
there
is
where
u.s.
plywood
has
the
plant.
it
has
a
yard
in
which
this
lumber
from
canada
was
unloaded,
piled
in
the
yard.
now,
that
lumber
came
in
green,
full
of
water.
before
that
lumber
could
be
used
in
a
final
finished
product,
it
was
necessary
the
first
step
that
was
necessary
was
to
remove
the
moisture
from
the
lumber.
that
is
done
in
one
of
two
ways.
the
lumber
can
be
kiln
dried
or
--
in
a
shed
or
building
or
it
can
be
air
dried.
air-drying
is
much
less
expensive
than
kiln-drying.
air-drying
is
what
this
lumber
was
being
subjected
to
when
it
was
piled
out
in
the
yard.
yes,
it
was
piled
in
a
manner
so
as
to
prevent
decay.
but
it
was
piled,
and
this
is
a
finding
of
the
court
after
a
full
trial,
it
was
piled
in
that
yard
with
the
dominant
purpose,
the
dominant
purpose
of
air-drying
that
lumber.
the
trial
court
held
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
affirmed
that
at
the
time
that
lumber
was
being
air-dried,
it
was
being
subjected
to
manufacture
in
its
first
stage.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir,
as
a
second
step.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir,
as
i
understand
it.
that
is
respondent's
position
so
far
as
the
imported
lumber.
now
--
and
that
is
the
easier
one,
as
to
the
lumber
and
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
now
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
sir,
we
tax
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
your
honor,
it's
clear.
may
1st
is
our
taxation
date.
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
now
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
your
honor,
the
trial
court
did
not
handle
the
question
in
that
way.
the
trial
court
simply
said
that
most
of
the
lumber
came
in
green
and
that
the
assessor
could
have
assessed
all
of
that,
he
did
not
do
it.
there
is
only
half
of
that
lumber
actually
that
was
assessed.
and
it
was
not
assessed
primarily
on
the
theory
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
it
was
air-drying.
mr.
edwin
larkin
the
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
that
one
half
of
the
imported
lumber
and
veneer
was
necessary
to
current
operational
needs
and
was
therefore
taxable.
now,
the
trial
court
--
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
this,
that
i'm
talking
about,
that
mr.
minahan
brought
up
yesterday,
is
something
that
was
put
in
in
addition
to
the
trial
court
in
which
the
trial
court
said
the
assessor
could
have
assessed
the
entire
lumber,
the
entire
imported
lumber
be
assessed
on
the
hand.
he
could
have
assessed
all
of
it.
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
i
think
that
is
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
in
this
matter
but
the
--
the
question
is
not
--
did
not
go
before
to
wisconsin.
mr.
edwin
larkin
it
isn't,
your
honor.
i
mean
that's
just
my
statement.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
this
was
just
added
by
the
trial
courts.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
now,
i'd
like
to
move
to
the
matter
of
the
current
operational
needs
theory
on
which
the
imported
lumber
and
imported
veneer,
one
half
of
them
were
held
to
be
taxable.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
oh,
you
put
--
you
put
a
little
thin
piece
of
one
by
one
or
one
by
two
in
between
each
board,
each
piece
of
lumber,
yes.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir,
and
that
was
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
was
in
the
opinion,
yes,
sir.
now,
moving
to
the
matter
of
the
current
operational
needs
and
that
is
involved
with
the
original
package
theory
and
the
matter
of
imports
having
been
put
to
the
use
for
which
they
were
imported.
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
the
imported
goods
were
irrevocably,
and
i'm
now
talking
about
the
part
that
was
taxed
one
half,
the
imported
goods
were
irrevocably
committed
to
a
manufacturing
process
and
a
manufactured
product
at
algoma.
now,
the
facts
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
ultimate
use,
your
honor.
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
was
criticized
in
the
hooven
case
is
the
mere
fact
that
they're
there
does
not
mean
that
they
have
been
put
to
use.
now,
the
theory
of
the
respondent
is
that
they
have
been
irrevocably
committed
to
use
and
the
facts,
i
think,
bare
out
and
the
facts
are
these.
u.s.
plywood
has,
at
algoma,
a
plant
and
personal
property
worth
about
$5,000,000.
it
has
land,
it
has
buildings,
it
has
machinery
real,
it
has
machinery
personal,
it
has
furniture,
fixtures,
repairs
and
processing
material.
in
that
processing
material
is
the
imported
veneer
and
the
imported
lumber
about
which
we're
talking.
now,
that
is
an
industrial
unit.
u.s.
plywood
is
engaged
in
business
for
a
profit.
it's
a
competitive
business.
all
of
those
items
which
i
mentioned
are
part
of
an
industrial
unit.
if
anyone
of
those
items
is
absent,
the
industrial
unit
does
not
function.
if
there
is
no
machinery,
it
does
not
function.
in
other
words,
the
machinery
that's
there,
like
anything
else
that's
there,
is
committed
to
an
industrial
unit.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
--
i
thank
your
honor.
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
remark.
so
that
the
wood
is
as
irrevocably
committed
to
that
industrial
unit
at
algoma
as
is
the
machinery
or
the
buildings
or
anything
else
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
something
has
been
added
to
the
hooven
case
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
edwin
larkin
and
the
veneer.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
that
both
the
lumber
and
the
veneer
have
been
committed
to
that
industrial
unit
and
have
been
irrevocably
committed
to
a
final
manufactured
product.
mr.
edwin
larkin
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
this
industrial
unit
could
not
function
unless
everyone
of
these
parts
were
present.
and
for
that
reason,
that
the
imported
lumber
and
the
imported
veneer
have
been
irrevocably
committed
to
an
industrial
product
and
that
is
what
is
added
to
the
hooven
case.
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that,
sir,
is
right.
now,
there
was
--
i
don't
know
that
it's
too
important.
the
matter
of
intermingling
was
brought
up
here
yesterday.
on
page
16
of
the
record,
the
--
the
trial
court's
opinion
is
there.
the
trial
court
said
that
there
was
not
such
commingling
of
the
foreign
and
domestic
veneers
or
lumber,
their
foreign
with
the
domestic
as
to
cause
loss
of
identity.
but
the
court
did
brought
to
the
attention,
if
this
is
important,
that
a
portion
of
a
new
shipment,
a
few
more
veneer
would
be
placed
on
a
partially
depleted
pile
of
that
veneer
and
could
be
the
first
taken
for
use.
in
this
case,
i
--
i
don't
see
the
importance
of
it
but
i
am
calling
the
attention
of
the
court
to
it
because
the
question
was
raised
yesterday.
now,
as
to
this
matter
of
how
the
court
arrived
at
one
half
of
the
imported
lumber
and
veneer
as
being
necessary
for
current
operational
uses.
this
was
not
done
by
--
in
a
--
in
a
hit
or
miss
fashion.
this
case
was
--
there
was
a
full
trial.
we
tried
it
most
of
one
week
and
part
of
another
week.
the
assessor,
special
assessor
was
called
under
wisconsin
practice
for
adverse
examination
and
examined
by
mr.
minahan
for
a
day
and
a
half
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
i
called
him
as
my
witness,
the
assessor,
and
mr.
minahan
had
another
opportunity
to
cross-examine
him.
now,
the
assessor
determined
that
in
his
mind
that
it
was
necessary
one
half
of
the
imports
for
current
operational
needs.
the
trial
court
also
found,
and
this
is
not
a
--
that
a
reasonable
supply
be
kept
on
hand,
this
is
not
a
reasonable
supply,
there's
amount
necessary
for
current
operational
use.
page
13
of
the
record,
and
by
the
way
the
whole
--
the
whole
opinion
of
the
trial
court
is
in
one
sentence
on
page
13,
i'm
not
going
to
read
it.
but
in
that
sentence,
the
trial
court
speaks
of
the
imports
required
to
be
on
hand
to
meet
the
immediate
or
current
needs
of
a
manufacturer.
turn
to
page
15,
still
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
had
just
finished
within
illustrative
case
in
commenting
said
the
minimum
requirement
of
current
needs.
that's
what
the
trial
court
had
in
mind.
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
just
a
reasonable
supply.
going
down
a
little
farther
on
that
page,
the
trial
court
said
“the
immediate
needs,”
but
the
trial
court
was
--
had
in
mind
was
what
was
the
minimum
amount
necessary.
and
at
page
43,
the
opinion
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
i
say
page
43
of
the
record.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
uses,
in
the
middle
of
that
page,
a
certain
minimum
stockpile
of
raw
materials.
that's
what
our
wisconsin
supreme
court
understood
the
trial
court
was
fixing.so
if
there's
any
question
about
whether
a
minimum
amount
necessary
for
current
operational
needs
was
the
theory
of
the
trial
court
that
was
it.
now,
as
to
the
trial
court's
decision,
trial
court
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
on
which
i
have
given.
again,
back
on
page
13
of
the
record,
it's
all
in
two
--
in
two
lines.
speaking
of
this
--
these
current
operational
needs
and
the
raw
materials,
imported
raw
materials,
trial
court
said
“have
so
finally
come
to
rest
in
his
plan
there
to
a
practical
certainty
to
lose
out
their
identity
in
a
manufactured
product”.
that
is
the
trial
court's
holding.
go
to
page
15.
this
was
not
only
on
the
basis
of
what
the
assessor
said.
we
introduced,
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
--
of
testimony,
and
there
were
exhibits
on
an
entirely
different
theory,
the
manufacturing
cycle
which
the
trial
court
speaks
of
on
page
15,
that
was
--
how
long
it
would
take
a
product
to
go
through
that
operation.
and
on
the
basis
of
those
facts,
the
trial
court
said,
“the
manufacturing
cycle
test”,
and
that
was
the
respondents,
“amply
supports
the
conclusion
of
the
assessor
that
one
half
of
the
foreign
imports
on
hand
may
1st
were
required
to
be
on
hand
to
the
meet
plaintiff's
immediate
needs.”
mr.
edwin
larkin
we
think
that
--
that
something
has
been
added
to
this
case,
your
honor,
and
that
the
--
in
the
hooven
case,
there
was
no
finding
by
the
--
i
don't
know
about
the
trial
court,
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
minimum
inventory
necessary
for
current
operational
needs.
in
other
words,
this
court
did
not
consider
that
questionnaire.
mr.
edwin
larkin
you
mean
in
--
in
the
present
case,
your
honor?
mr.
edwin
larkin
i
recognized
that,
your
honor.
the
difference
in
this
case
and
the
hooven
case
are
that
in
this
case,
a
certain
minimum
stockpile
inventory
was
necessary
for
current
operational
needs.
it
was
determined
to
be
necessary.
it
was
found
by
the
court
to
be
necessary
after
a
trial
and
--
from
which
no
bill
of
exceptions
was
prepared.
and
as
i
understand,
if
this
court
should
find
that
the
current
operational
needs
theory
is
a
correct
one,
then
there
is
no
contest
about
whether
the
trial
court
found
the
right
amount
or
not,
one
half.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
would
have
been
a
different
result
but
the
--
the
matter
was
not
even
considered
according
to
the
opinion
in
the
hooven
case.
as
i
remember
the
words,
“hence
we
have
no
occasion
to
consider
it.”
so
it
wasn't
considered.
now,
it's
before
the
court.
and
we're
asking
that
the
court
consider
it.
maybe
that
be
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
i
think,
your
honor,
that
all,
except
what
is
necessary
for
immediate
use,
would
be
free.
in
other
words,
only
that
part
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
immediate
current
operational
needs
is
taxable
and
the
rest
over
and
above
that
i
should
consider
not
to
be
taxable.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
which
is
necessary
for
current
operational
use
until
more
it
can
be
obtained.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
is
entirely
possible,
your
honor.
that
is
a
discrimination.
and
as
i
remember
the
--
the
court
said
that
--
that
there
is
some
discrimination
inherent
in
this
situation.
mr.
edwin
larkin
but
there
is
some
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
if
you
put
it
on
that
basis,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
edwin
larkin
then
i
say
yes,
your
honor.
maybe
the
small
business
administration
now
will
take
care
of
that.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
larkin
on
this
basis,
your
honor,
the
--
the
basis
of
the
trial
court
set
it
was
that
take
the
length
of
time
it
would
be
necessary
to
get
new
material,
new
imported
material,
the
additional
imported
material
that
what
is
on
hand
necessary
for
manufacturing
needs
until
further
material
can
be
obtained
that
that
has
been
--
has
come
to
rest
has
been
dedicated
to
a
product,
a
manufactured
product
and
has
been
taking
out
of
the
stream
of
commerce.
mr.
edwin
larkin
oh,
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
--
what
is
--
no,
it's
not
quite,
your
honor,
that
what
is
committed
is
what
is
necessary
for
a
current
inventory
until
more
can
be
obtained
by
ordering.
mr.
edwin
larkin
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
larkin
but,
your
honor,
it's
taken
as
of
the
first
day
of
may.
and
we
take
that
once
a
year
in
wisconsin.
if
orders
fall
off,
you're
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
larkin
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
think
you
could
because
that
would
--
part
of
what
you're
talking
--
part
of
that
amount
you
were
talking
about
is
not
necessary
for
current
operational
needs.
it's
not
committed
to
a
present
product.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
under
the
--
under
the
hooven
case,
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
an
import.
and
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
stay
out
of
trouble
here
and
--
and
not
get
over
into
that.
i
mean
enough
now
[laughter].
and
i
--
i'd
like
to
stay
away
from
that.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
i
hope
you
don't
have
too,
your
honor.
that
--
it's
a
matter
--
it's
within
the
hooven
case.
it
could
come
in
the
case
--
the
ohio
case
that
was
here
yesterday
that
i
can
see
how
it
might
come
up.
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
keep
our
case
out
of
it.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
i
don't
see
that
it's
different,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
this
case
away
from
that
and
--
and
i'd
like
to
keep
it
away
from
that.[laughter]
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
larkin
it
was
not
in
ours.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
that
is
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
no.
i
should
like
to
work
in
to
this
matter.
i
think
there
has
--
that
there's
confusion
that
has
resulted
from
the
original
package
theory
in
this
matter
of
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
all
right,
your
honor.
i
was
just
going
to
comment
that
it
arose
in
brown
against
maryland,
and
--
and
i
--
i
find
hooven
&
allison
against
--
confusing.
i
find
five
statements
in
that
case
where
the
court
talks
about
the
property
stand
of
the
original
package
rule
and
then
or
until
put
to
the
use
for
which
it
was
imported.
oh,
now,
that
--
whether
those
are
mutually
exclusive
is
not
clear
and
yet,
on
--
on
page
666
of
that
--
of
hooven
&
allison
and
mr.
minahan
referred
to
that
this
morning.
chief
justice
taney's
remarks
in
the
license
cases
and
--
and
in
the
hooven
case,
this
court
says
“as
we
now
affirm,”
and
then
it
quotes
it,
“in
the
goods
imported
while
they
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
importer
in
the
form
and
shape
in
which
they
were
brought
into
the
country
can,
in
no
just
sense,
he
regarded
as
part
of
that
mass
of
property
in
the
state
usually
tax
for
the
support
of
state
government,”
which
apparently
throws
out
entirely
the
matter
of
use
and
says
--
or
it
meant
--
there's
the
conflict
and
says,
“if
they're
in
the
original
package,
that's
it,
they're
not
taxable.”
i
--
i
think
there's
some
confusion
there
that
could
well
be
--
be
straightened
out.
mr.
edwin
larkin
i
realized
that,
your
honor,
and
i
appreciate
it.
mr.
edwin
larkin
[laughs]
well,
i
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
sir,
but
i
--
i'm
unable
to
--
to
--
i
think
there's
a
difference
right
in
the
hooven
case
as
to
what
this
or
as
to
what
the
court
means.
mr.
edwin
larkin
well,
evidently,
i
can
--
i
can
give
you
an
offhand
but
i
can
say
that
in
view
of
the
reply
brief
served
upon
me
by
mr.
minahan.
and
on
the
first
page,
he
states
the
rule
of
brown
against
maryland
and
hooven
&
allison
against
evatt.
and
there's
the
matter
of
use.
it
apparently
confused
him
too
because
he
could
--
mr.
edwin
larkin
no,
he
hasn't,
your
honor.
maybe
his
matter
of
--
that
something
has
been
added
could
be
clarified
a
little
by
going
to
low
against
austin
which
involved
wine
imported
for
sale
essentially
similar
to
the
hooven
case
except
that
it
involved
a
product
for
sale,
except
rather
than
a
product
for
use.
the
wine
was
on
the
shelf
in
the
original
containers.
the
court
held
it
not
to
be
taxable
but
supposed
that
one
more
fact
were
added
there,
supposed
the
wine
merchant's
wife
came
in
and
said,
“now,
we
haven't
any
wine
at
home,
john,
and
we
need
some.”
that
is
the
red
light.
mr.
edwin
larkin
“we
need
some
and
will
you
bring
some
home?”
and
john
points
to
the
jogged
down
on
the
end
and
he
said,
“that's
just
like
we
have
and
that's
what
we
want.
i'll
bring
it
home.”
now,
i
say
that
in
that
respect,
that
jogged
down
on
the
end
adding
this
fact
to
the
low
--
to
low
against
austin,
that
jogged
down
on
the
end
have
been
committed.
it
satisfied
all
the
original
package
rule
but
it
had
been
committed.
something
had
been
added.
and
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
something
had
been
added.
