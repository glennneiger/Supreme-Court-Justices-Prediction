justice
hugo

black
what
--
where
is
the
state
statute
printed
in
your
brief
on
the
--
this
map
that
--
under
which
you
have
made
that
parameter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
which
--
what
number
is
the
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
in
particularly
then?
does
it
delay
tax
on
anything
but
import?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
ore
had
come
from
some
state
where
they
have
ores
say
like
alabama.would
it
--
would
the
state
tax
cover
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
any
question
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
challenge
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
these
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean,
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
your
challenge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
if
that
is
a
package,
how
could
you
break
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
stored
for
10
years,
you
didn't
have
this
date
(inaudible)
suppose,
stored
in
10
years
and
then
you
--
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
it
would
depend
on
the
place
where
they're
stored,
a
constitutional
question,
isn't
it?
well,
you
were
drawing
a
distinction
as
to
the
place
where
it's
stored.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
a
constitutional
basis,
do
you
think
it's
a
--
that
it
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
it's
at
this
particular
storage
place
or
no
under
those
views?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
be
any
less
valid
than
taxing
property
of
a
veteran
and
a
non-veteran
different?
the
same
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
i
understood
they
were
treating
all
here
the
same,
nonresidents
in
one
way
and
residents
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
about
the
veterans?
you're
taxing
property
and
you
would
--
do
you
say
that
every
veterans
have
not
--
no
veteran
in
this
state
should
be
taxed
for
his
home
--
on
his
home,
but
everybody
else
does.
and
you
--
how
--
how
can
that
become
(inaudible)
unless
you're
going
to
say
that
one
ground
the
state
uses
is
better
than
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
defending
this
case,
are
you
not,
on
this
one
ground
and
i
suppose
it
is
and
ohio
has
a
right
if
it
wants
to,
to
affect
nonresidents
of
the
state
by
providing
that
they
can
have
storage
free
from
taxation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
other
people
have
to
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
attracted
that
nonresident,
but
then
he
had
came
in,
who
is
not
really
exempted
for
storage
tax,
but
every
other
tax
for
10
years,
would
that
violate
the
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose.
does
ohio
have
any
law
like
that,
many
of
the
states
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
also
true
in
reference
to
taxing
merchants
not
doing
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
general
method
that
--
that
you
use
in
computing
tax
on
changing
stocks.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
this
method
of
taxation
may
in
fact
tax
all
that
came
in
the
day
before
the
tax
incidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
all
that
maybe
taken
out
the
day
after
the
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
no
attack
on
that
ground,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
any
contention
made
by
the
taxpayer
that
they
couldn't
tax
that
which
was
brought
in
the
day
before,
but
they
could
tax
that
which
was
brought
in
at
some
prior
period?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
defendant
talked
about
packages
in
its
motions
and
its
attack
on
the
law
business
in
every
paragraph
frankly
it
used.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
is
a
constitutional
question.
are
we
suppose
to
decide
in
it,
if
they
haven't
raised?
have
they
raised
any
question
here
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
tax
on
the
--
or
anyone,
that
you're
to
be
able
to
tax
that
which
came
in
a
day
before,
but
you
can't
tax
that
which
came
in
a
long
time
before,
have
they
ever
raised
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
raise
the
question
before
this
court
begins
to
try
to
find
a
state
law
in
constitution?
it
should
be
squarely
raised
and
it
shouldn't
have
to
hunt
for
it.
is
that
--
want
to
show
--
do
you
think
if
the
court,
to
try
to
find
new
grounds
that
the
defense
didn't
find
to
hold
a
state
law
unconstitutional?
