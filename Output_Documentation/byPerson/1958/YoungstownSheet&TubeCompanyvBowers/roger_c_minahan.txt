mr.
roger
c.
minahan
mr.
chief
justice,
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
which
affirmed
a
circuit
court
decision
denying
a
refund
of
a
tax
paid
by
the
petitioner.
the
tax
was
on
imported
goods.
the
petitioner
operates
a
plant
at
the
city
of
algoma,
wisconsin,
where
it
manufactures
plywood
products.
wisconsin's
personal
property
tax,
this
was
an
ad
valorem
general
personal
property
tax,
is
levied
on
may
1
of
each
year
on
the
goods
on
hand
on
that
date.
the
petitioner
in
its
manufacture
uses
lumber
imported
from
canada
and
veneers
imported
from
canada,
france
and
the
belgian
congo,
and
had
such
lumber
and
veneers
on
hand
on
that
date.
the
lumber
imported
from
canada
is
cut
in
canada,
rough,
unplaned
form
and
then
shipped
by
railroad
to
algoma,
wisconsin.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
algoma
is
on
the
western
shore
of
lake
michigan
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
oh,
no.
no,
over
on
lake
michigan.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
the
lumber
is
loaded
loose
on
cars.
it's
not
packaged
in
anyway
or
fastened
together.
when
the
lumber
reaches
algoma,
it's
unloaded
and
stacked
in
the
storage
yard
of
the
petitioner
adjacent
to
the
petitioner's
plant.
the
stacking
is
done
in
a
manner
to
prevent
rotting
of
the
lumber
and
it
air
dries
during
the
course
of
that
period
it
is
in
the
storage
yard.
the
stacking
is
done
by
separating
the
sticks
so
that
air
can
gain
access
to
the
individual
sticks.
and
it
is
stacked
in
piles
which
are
called
packages
and
which
are
not
to
be
confused
with
the
kind
of
packages
we
talked
about
under
brown
versus
maryland,
for
instance.
but
they
are
of
identical
size
for
the
purpose
of
moving
them
in
one
unit
into
the
dry
kiln.
each
of
the
--
or
all
of
the
lumber
must
be
kiln-dried
before
it
used
in
the
manufacture
of
plywood.
the
lumber's
imported
is
not
commingled
in
any
way
with
any
domestic
lumber.
shipments
are
not
commingled
but
occupy
separate
stacks
convenient
or
an
--
of
a
size
--
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
your
honor.
we
do.
that
however
--
i
don't
want
to
--
i
--
i
can't
say
it's
the
purpose
of
it.
it
is
the
action
of
getting
a
stack
of
a
size
which
will
fit
the
dry
kiln.
and
that's
the
way
it's
taken
out
of
the
yard
into
the
dry
kiln
when
it's
needed
for
manufacture.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
your
honor.
you
can.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
not
only
by
looking
at
it,
but
it
is
identified
with
a
tag
as
well.
the
trial
court
found
that
on
the
testimony
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
was
to
stack
this
lumber
for
the
purpose
of
air
drying
it,
to
take
advantage
of
the
air
drying.
though
--
the
trial
court
also
found
that
another
purpose
was
to
prevent
rotting
which
would
inevitably
follow
if
the
lumber
was
not
separated
by
sticks
and
air
could
be
in
access
to
lumber
in
the
stack.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
was
brought
into
the
plant
from
time
to
time
as
needed
without
regard
to
how
long
it
might've
been
in
the
yard.
though
it
was
admitted
that
if
the
lumber
is
permitted
to
air
dry,
it
reduces
to
some
extent
the
time
required
in
the
dry
kiln.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
however,
it
must
be
dry
kiln.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
therefore,
the
court
found
--
the
trial
court
found
reducing
expense
because
reducing
time
in
the
dry
kiln.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
there
was
no
testimony
on
that,
your
honor.
as
to
--
for
instance,
selection
of
that
stack
which
had
been
there
the
longest
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
that.
there
was
no
testimony
on
that
point.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
well,
that
was
a
conclusion
of
law
drawn
by
this
trial
court
on
the
finding
of
fact
that
the
dominant
purpose
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
air
drying
time.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
had
begun.
that
was
their
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
they're
stacked
in
a
crossed
manner
so
that
the
air
can
get
through
to
all
the
stacks.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
no.
not
all
on
top
of
each
other,
all
continous.
the
veneers
imported
both
from
canada
and
from
africa
and
europe
all
were
reshipped
to
the
united
states
in
packages.
either
in
crates
or
bound
together
with
metal
strips.
they're
shipped
via
water
those
from
the
--
from
europe
and
africa
to
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states.
and
they're
loaded
on
to
railcars
and
brought
by
rail
to
algoma.
the
canadian
veneers
are
shipped
from
canada
in
railroad
cars.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
--
they
were
received
in
algoma
in
railroad
cars.
the
import
seal
broken,
customs
--
clearing
customs
in
algoma.
they
were
removed
from
the
cars
and
stored
in
a
warehouse
which
is
a
building
adjacent
to
the
petitioner's
factory
in
algoma.
there
was
no
finding,
never
any
suggestion
anywhere,
that
any
change
of
any
character
had
taken
place
in
the
veneers,
so
stored
in
the
warehouse.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
it
was
trucked,
your
honor,
from
the
warehouse
to
the
manufacturing
plant.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes.
the
veneers
were
never
commingled.
they
were
placed
in
stacks
in
the
warehouse
always
identifiable
as
veneers
from
particular
locations,
africa,
belgian
--
belgian
congo,
france
and
canada.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
in
that
case,
there
was
no
identification.
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
that
except
that
each
package
had
a
shipping
mark,
so
that
it
was
possible
to
go
and
identify
as
to
when
it
arrived.
the
stacking
would
be
done
in
--
in
various
piles
of
packages
one
on
top
of
the
other.
and
you
would
add
to
this
(inaudible)
of
stacks
or
select
another
spot
in
the
warehouse
and
they
might
be
adjacent
to
that
pile,
a
stack
of
domestic
veneers
as
well.
however,
always
separated
into
a
different
stack
or
a
different
pile
so
it
did
not
mix
the
two.
the
city
of
algoma
in
may
1,
1955,
levied
a
tax
on
the
--
both
the
lumber
and
veneer
that
were
located
in
the
storage
yard
and
in
the
warehouse.
they,
of
course,
also
levied
a
tax
upon
that
part
of
the
imported
goods
both
in
and
out
of
their
packages
which
were
in
the
factory
itself.
though
those
--
that
assessment
as
to
the
property
that
was
in
the
factory
whether
in
or
out
of
the
package
is
not
involved
here.
it
was
not
contested.
we
deal
here
only
with
the
assessment
on
the
lumber
and
veneers
in
the
storage
yard
and
in
the
warehouse.
the
total
value
of
the
goods
found
on
that
date
worth
$288,593
and
they
were
as
such
that
$144,296.
the
ratio
of
assessment
to
true
value
in
the
city
of
algoma
in
1955
was
100%
and
the
reason
they
were
assessed
at
50%
of
their
true
market
value,
in
this
case,
was
on
the
ground
that
the
assessor
determined
that
one-half
of
the
veneers
on
hand
were
currently
operationally
required
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
for
its
manufacturing
process.
the
petitioner
objected
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
until
the
assessment
on
these
goods
on
the
ground
that
it
was
in
violation
of
clause
2
of
section
10
of
article
i
of
the
constitution.
the
case
ultimately,
after
a
hearing
before
a
board
of
review,
reached
the
circuit
court
for
kewaunee
county
which
is
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction
of
wisconsin.
and
there,
the
position
of
the
city
was
that
the
goods
were
currently
operationally,
necessary
to
the
extent
of
half
of
what
was
on
hand
and
hence,
came
within
an
exception
indicated
in
hooven
&
allison
versus
evatt,
to
the
original
package
rule,
or
the
rule
of
the
brown
case.
now,
the
assessor,
in
this
instance,
determined
what
was
taxable
according
to
the
findings
below
by
an
observation
of
what
the
methods
of
the
petitioner
were
with
respect
to
the
use
of
its
imported
goods.
the
testimony
was
that
he
knew
how
much
in
value,
the
petitioner
had
on
hand
in
its
warehouse.
he
observed
the
removal
of
goods
from
the
warehouse
to
the
factory.
the
arrival
of
goods
to
the
warehouse
from
the
foreign
shipment
and
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
one-half
of
the
goods
were
required
to
be
kept
on
hand,
to
meet
the
current
operational
needs
of
the
petitioner.
the
circuit
court
for
kewaunee
county
sustained
that
conclusion
by
the
assessor,
taking
the
position
that
the
amount
of
such
goods
which
could
be
included
within
the
assessment
were
not
unlimited
to
the
immediate
needs
of
the
petitioner
in
the
factory,
in
the
manufacturing
operation.
and
concluding
with
the
portion
so
included
were
--
was
taken
out
of
the
stream
of
commerce
and
had
come
to
rest
in
the
plant
of
the
petitioner.
there,
to
a
practical
certainty,
to
be
used
in
its
manufacturing
process
and
not
reshipped
in
the
original
form
or
packaging.
and
hence,
because
it
was
so
highly
improbable
that
it
would
again
be
sold
and
transported
in
commerce
that
it
will
become
a
part
of
the
commoness
of
property
in
the
state
and
could
be
taxed.
as
to
the
lumber,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
assessor
would
have
been
justified
in
taxing
it
all,
going
to
taxed
only
half
on
the
current
operational
needs
fairly,
because
it
had
been
subjected
to
manufacture
by
reason
of
it
having
been
stacked
in
the
storage
yard
to
take
advantage
of
air-drying
which
took
place
between
the
time
it
was
stored
there
and
ultimately
taken
into
the
factory
for
manufacture.
this
was
a
suit
for
a
refund,
so
it
did
not
affect
the
determination
at
all,
but
it
indicated
that
the
court
would've
gone
private
in
the
assumption
in
that
respect.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
in
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
the
dissenting
judges,
i
think,
took
the
position
that
they
would
have
been
trying
to
go
along
with
the
majority
on
that
issue
and
indicated
that
their
only
conclusion
was
asked
to
the
packaged
goods.
it's
correct.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
i
make
none,
your
honor.
i
think
the
position
that
--
that
the
lumber
and
the
veneer
both
were
all,
should
have
been
not
taxed.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
no,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
well
--
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
well,
i
think
that
for
instance
this
court
could
decide
such
as
the
wisconsin
court,
both
from
a
majority
and
minority
indicated
that
by
reason
of
its
stacking
for
in
the
yard
and
the
air
drying
which
took
place
that
it
might
have
been
--
comes
--
it
might
have
been
subjected
to
manufacture
or
have
entered
the
manufacturing
process
and
therefore,
the
lumber
might
be
subject
to
tax
100%.
on
the
other
hand,
the
veneers,
none
of
which
had
any
chemical
change
or
any
other
change
at
all
taking
place,
could
nevertheless
be
found
by
this
court
to
be
completely
free
from
tax.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
oh
,i'm
sorry.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
your
honor,
it
could.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
that's
right.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
a
divided
opinion,
held
or
--
or
cited
with
the
approval,
the
trial
court's
opinion
as
to
the
basis
for
holding
the
property,
one-half
of
the
property
taxable
under
current
operational
needs
theory,
it
went
further
and
said
that
for
two
reasons,
the
lumber
would
be
subject
to
tax.
first,
because
it
was
unpackaged
and
because
it
was
unpackaged,
it
was
--
it
didn't
come
within
any
of
the
rules
with
respect
to
exclusion
from
tax
for
imported
goods
and
secondly,
because
it
had
entered
the
manufacturing
process
as
it
was
stacked
for
the
purpose
of
taking
advantage
of
the
natural
process
of
air-drying.
the
veneers,
they
found
some
--
considerable
more
difficulty
with,
but
concluded
that
it
was
necessary
that
the
importer
and
manufacturer
in
this
case,
have
on
hand,
a
reasonable
supply
of
such
goods
and
that
therefore,
it
could
be
considered
as
having
been
put
to
use
in
effect
or
subjected
to
manufacture,
that
they
do
not
use
that
term
in
the
opinion,
because
it
was
assembled
there
and
available
for
the
purpose
of
putting
it
to
use
and
the
plant
could
not
operate
unless
it
was
there.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
no,
your
honor,
only
50%
of
it
was
included.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
on
the
veneer
as
well.
they
took
the
position
that
to
require
breaking
of
a
package
was
to
artificially
test
and
to
mechanically
test
and
that
it
was
equally
mechanical
and
disregardful
of
reality
to
say
that
some
change
had
to
take
place
in
the
article
itself.
in
this
respect,
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
--
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
that
--
that
part
was
necessary
in
the
current
operational
needs
of
the
manufacturer.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
the
basis
for
saying
this
as
to
the
lumber,
both
by
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
court
was
that
it
had
entered
the
manufacturing
process
because
of
the
air
drying
which
was
taking
place,
the
chemical
change.
they
talked
about
wood
being
a
combination
of
wood
and
diffused
water
and
some
of
the
diffused
water
was
evaporated
off
by
reason
of
the
storage
in
the
yard.
as
to
the
veneers,
there
was
admittedly
no
change
in
--
in
form
or
character
at
all.
that
was
stored
in
a
--
they
are
--
a
veneer,
your
honors,
is
a
thin
slice
of
wood
peeled
from
a
log
and
has
been
kiln-dried
before
it's
been
shipped.
so
that
it's
pretty
well
run
free
of
water
at
that
point.
and
it
was
admitted,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
no
change
taking
place
in
the
veneers
while
stored
in
the
warehouse.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
petitioner
that
this
conclusion
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
clearly
opposed
to
the
fundamental
and
thouroghly
agreed
rules
of
law,
which
have
been
clearly
enunciated
by
this
court.
beginning
with
brown
versus
maryland,
which
we
think
together
with
hooven
&
allison
versus
evatt,
just
disposed
of
this
case.
in
brown
versus
maryland,
the
court
said
that
a
point
of
some
practical
determination
must
be
made
when
an
import
ceases
to
have
a
--
the
character
of
an
import
and
becomes
something
other
than
an
import.
and
in
formulating
a
general
rule,
the
court
pointed
out
that
it
was
necessary
that
there'd
be
some
affirmative
action
on
the
part
of
the
importer
which
would
cause
the
property
to
become
mixed
up
with
the
massive
property
in
this
country.
then
the
court
says,
because
there
were
original
packages
there
involved,
that
at
least
we
--
that
case
had
the
clear
kind
of
a
situation
that
required
no
further
inquiry,
though
there
were
going
to
be
cases
they
anticipated
that
were.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
no,
i
--
i
have
not.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
parties
below
and
the
courts
below
agree
that
the
goods
here
acquired
the
status
of
imports
and
that
until
they
lose
their
character
as
such,
they
are
not
subject
to
the
state
tax
here
involved.
we
think
this
means
that
on
the
facts
which
i
recited
yesterday
that
brown
and
the
hooven
case
disposed
of
the
matter
and
that
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed.
the
rule
is
fundamentally
the
general
rule
indicated
in
brown
versus
maryland
that
imports
do
not
lose
their
character
as
such
until
they
are
acted
upon
by
the
importer
in
some
manner
to
mix
them
up
with
the
general
property
of
this
country.
that
is
the
general
rule
and
the
chief
justice
in
that
case
said
that
it
required
that
the
distinctions
be
marked
as
the
cases
arise.
but
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
there
was
a
clear
situation
that
plainly
meant
that
the
goods
were
not
subject
to
state
tax
and
it
was
the
kind
of
tax
situation
that
was
presented
in
that
case,
and
that
is
that
the
goods,
if
they
remain
the
property
of
the
importer
and
stored
in
his
warehouse
in
the
original
package
or
form
in
which
they
were
brought
in
to
this
country
are
clearly
exempt.
this
is
the
clear
or
the
plain
case
of
immunity
that
requires
no
further
examination
and
is
one
of
the
most
outstanding
examples
of
the
general
rule.
we
think
that
this
clearly
applies
in
this
particular
case.
the
goods
here
were
brought
into
the
--
into
this
country.
there
was
no
action
on
the
part
of
the
importer.
they
were
stored
in
his
storage
yard
and
in
his
warehouse.
they
were
not
in
anyway
mixed
up
with
the
general
mass
of
property
in
this
country.
this
general
rule
and
the
more
specific
one
applicable
to
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
was
reiterated
in
low
versus
austin
and
was
emphatically
confirmed
by
chief
justice
stone
in
the
hooven
case.
in
the
hooven
case,
this,
i
think,
was
made
quite
clear
by
chief
justice
stone
when
he
said
that
no
opinion
of
this
court
has
ever
said
or
intimated
that
imports
held
by
the
importer
in
the
original
package
and
before
they
were
subjected
to
the
manufacture
for
which
they
are
imported
are
reliable
to
state
taxation.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
yes,
your
honor
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
until
some
affirmative
action,
your
honor,
is
taken
by
the
importer
to
change
the
form
or
substance
of
what
he
has
imported.
and
in
the
hooven
case,
chief
justice
stone
called
attention
to
the
decision
in
low
versus
austin
which
i
think
further
illustrates
this
particular
point,
and
he
quoted
from
the
language
in
low
versus
austin
by
chief
justice
taney
in
which
it
was
said
that
goods
imported
while
they
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
importer
in
the
form
and
shape
in
which
they
were
brought
into
this
country
continued
to
be
immune
from
the
state
tax.
now,
in
the
hooven
case,
the
suggestion
was
made
by
--
or
was
more
than
a
suggestion
the
lower
court
in
ohio
held
the
goods
all
subject
to
tax
because
they
were
stored
in
the
warehouse
awaiting
use,
and
this
was
the
theory
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
and
this
theory
was
expressly
rejected
by
the
court
in
the
hooven
case.
when
the
state
of
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
confronted
with
the
fact
that
the
awaiting
use
theory
had
been
completely
rejected,
they
talked
about
having
subjected
the
goods
to
manufacturer
by
a
reason
of
their
having
been
assembled
and
stored
in
the
warehouse
available
for
use.
and
the
court
there
says
this
is
tantamount
to
subjecting
the
goods
to
manufacturer
and
if
that
they
were
put
to
use
as
much
as
if
they
had
been
dried,
heated,
reshaped,
chemically
changed
or
otherwise
changed
in
form
or
composition.
now,
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
the
exact
language
of
what
they
said
in
their
opinion.
but
this
particular
approach
was
completely
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
hooven
case
and
the
language,
i
think,
couldn't
have
been
more
clear
than
chief
justice
stone
put
it
when
he
said,
and
these
were
his
words,
and
incidentally
this
--
this
was
the
opening
paragraph
of
the
section
which
the
supreme
court
finds
dictum
there,
the
chief
justice
said,
“it
cannot
be
said
that
the
fibers
were
subjected
to
manufacture
when
they
were
placed
in
petitioner's
warehouse
in
their
original
packaging.”
then
they
go
on
and
they
adopt
the
theory
that
the
current
operational
needs
concept
was
approved
by
the
dictum
in
that
case.
this
is
a
dangerous
concept
in
my
judgment
because
i
think
it
would
emasculate
all
of
the
130
years
of
what
we
have
understood
that
provision
of
the
constitution
to
mean,
and
we
don't
have
to
speculate
on
that.
while
this,
of
course,
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
if
this
concept
were
adopted
with
the
courts,
it
would
mean
the
elimination
of
any
exemption
to
goods
stored
in
the
warehouse
even
though
no
change
had
taken
place
or
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
in
the
year
following
that
here
involved,
the
assessor
in
wisconsin
taxed
all
of
the
goods
of
this
particular
petition
in
a
subsequent
tax
year
on
the
current
operational
needs
theory
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
orders
of
this
petitioner
were
down
in
volume,
and
there
were
no
--
nowhere
near
the
future
orders
involved.
and
the
stock
of
imported
goods
had
very
materially
and
substantially
increased
so
that
it
had
a
lower
order
file
and
a
far
higher
supply
of
the
goods
in
the
warehouse.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roger
c.
minahan
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
