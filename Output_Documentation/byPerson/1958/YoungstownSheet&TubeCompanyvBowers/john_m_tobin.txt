mr.
john
m.
tobin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
propose
to
discuss
only
the
aspect
of
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
case
which
involves
the
import
clause.
i
adopt
that
this
time
the
unequal
protection
argument
which
mr.
saxbe
made
and
the
--
if
the
court
may
recall
only
one
equal
protection
argument
was
made
in
the
briefs
in
--
in
cross
reference
was
made.
the
issue
as
we
are
involved
with
the
import
clause
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
ohio
can
tax
this
imported
iron
ore.
the
--
the
facts
have
been
stipulated
as
mr.
dargusch
pointed
out
that
they
are
relatively
simple.
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
company
imports
iron
ore
from
five
different
foreign
countries,
brings
this
iron
ore
to
the
plant
location
in
youngstown
and
then
carefully
segregates
each
individual
shipment
as
to
the
source
or
as
to
the
point
from
which
the
ore
originated.
in
other
words,
they
will
handle
the
mexican
iron
in
this
manner.
they
will
have
existing
at
the
plant
the
residue
of
a
previous
shipment
of
mexican
ore,
and
on
top
of
that,
they
will
place
the
just
received
shipment
of
mexican
ore.
at
the
same
time
from
a
day
to
day
basis,
withdrawals
would
be
made
indiscriminately
from
this
created
pile.
in
other
words,
in
any
scoop
taken
from
the
pile,
we
may
have
some
of
the
last
received
shipment
and
some
of
an
earlier
received
shipment
or
earlier
received
shipment
as
far
as
that
is
concerned.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
attempt
made
nor
i
supposed
could
one
be
made
to
use
the
ore
on
hand
prior
to
using
the
just
imported
ore
in
consideration
of
the
manner
which
they
handle
this
ore.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
correct.
our
tax
is
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
it
--
in
effect,
it
does.
in
other
words,
our
tax
is
a
month
end
evaluation
tax
on
the
property.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
except
that
as
to
inventory
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
--
a
manufacturer
is
entitled
to
average
his
inventory
over
the
12-month
basis.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
a
particular
shipment
of
ore
brought
in
from
brazil,
for
example,
would
come
in
to
youngstown
on
the
2nd
or
3rd
of
the
month
and
be
used
up
entirely
before
the
30th
or
31st
of
the
month,
there
would
be
no
tax
from
that
property.
but
the
ohio
scheme
of
taxation
is
that
the
month
end
evaluations
of
inventory
will
be
average
throughout
the
year
in
the
tax
paid
after
the
1st
of
january.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
as
to
merchants?
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
correct.
the
ohio
tax
is
a
tax
on
all
personal
property
located
and
used
in
business
in
ohio.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
correct.
it
works
both
ways,
in
other
words.
now
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
correct,
too.
i
--
i
think
that
although
this
doesn't
have
any
particular
significance
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
i
assume
that
the
legislative
decision
was
that
this
was
the
most
equitable
way
to
tax
inventories
of
manufacturers
and
merchants.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
there
is
none.
the
--
the
case
originally
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
well
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
there
is
none.
this
case
was
originally
determined
by
the
ohio
board
of
tax
appeals.
that
is
the
first
appellate
procedure
in
ohio.
and
the
board
of
tax
appeals
carefully
reviewed
each
of
the
authorities
or
perhaps
in
the
holding,
but
several
of
the
leading
authorities
on
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
import
clause
and
where
the
tax
appeals
erroneously
concluded
that
because
this
was
an
import
and
because
of
an
analogy
which
the
board
of
tax
appeals
moved
to
the
original
package
doctrine
that
the
state
of
ohio
could
not
probably
--
properly
tax
this
ore.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
the
question
as
posed
to
the
board
of
tax
appeals
was
whether
or
not
the
state
of
ohio
could
levy
this
tax
at
all
because
of
the
protection
of
the
import
clause.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
they
would
not
concede
the
taxability
of
any
portion
of
the
created
pile
in
their
storage
yard.
they
did
concede,
however,
that
the
ore
which
was
withdrawn
and
taken
to
the
stock
houses
or
stock
bins
near
the
blast
furnace
or
the
open
hearth
furnace
was
taxable
ore.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
--
i
am
afraid
that
there
is
a
basic
policy
in
their
position.
nowhere
along
the
line
so
far
as
i
know
had
they
enlightened
the
state
of
ohio
as
to
what
they
will
identify
as
the
original
package
if
they
contend
that
it
does
apply.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir,
i
will.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
so-called
original
package
doctrine
in
order
to
arrive
proper
determination
here.
much
is
made
of
the
fact
that
bulk
import
can
be
discriminated
against
in
favor
of
packaged
the
imports.
but
i
can
see
no
problem
if
we
simply
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
import
clause
which
is
to
protect
other
state
in
effect
from
the
levy
of
a
tax
by
a
seaboard
state.
as
i
understand
it
in
the
early
history,
the
fear
was
that
some
seaboard
states
would
make
the
economic
development
of
inland
states
difficult
by
reason
of
laying
taxes
on
imports
that
had
already
been
taxed
by
the
federal
government.
we
have
no
such
problem
here.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
oh,
no,
sir.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
oh,
certainly
not.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
i
think
perhaps
all
of
the
cases
that
had
come
up
were
something
other
than
import
taxes
by
a
state.
i
--
i
can't
think
of
any
case.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
is
your
question
whether
or
not
they
could
escape
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
in
the
abstract,
that
property
could
be
taxed,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
mean
to
say
that
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
thought
perhaps
you
were
referring
to
the
peculiar
system
of
taxation
in
ohio
that
is
to
say
that
on
the
30th
of
the
month.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
you
mean,
if
we
had
a
situation
where
they
did
not
comingle
and
withdraw
from
one
pile
and
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
--
as
they
do
have.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
feel
this
way
about
the
implications
of
the
import
clause
that
the
key
to
the
determination
is
whether
or
not
identification
of
the
import
can
be
made.
now,
for
example,
if
these
railroad
cars
were
brought
in
from
baltimore
where
some
of
their
foreign
shipments
are
received
and
--
and
then
transport
it
across
the
country
to
youngstown
and
kept
in
this
railroad
car
so
that
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
company
could
have
--
on
tax
listing
date
point
to
the
car
and
say,
"that's
an
import."
i
think
perhaps
the
import
clause
would
protect
that
and
i
think
it
would
not
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
--
that's
true.
yes,
sir,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
for
this
reason,
because
--
let's
take
a
specific
example.
suppose
we
have
a
pile
of
cuban
iron
ore
consisting
of
a
1000
tons
of
ore
that
there
is
then
brought
in
an
additional
10,000
tons
of
cuban
ore
dumped
right
on
top
of
this
ore
pile
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
on
the
following
day,
500
tons
were
removed
for
use
in
manufacturing.
then
on
that
following
day,
it
is
my
position
that
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
company
cannot
say
that
the
10,000
tons
imported
yesterday
are
--
is
--
is
in
this
pile,
in
this
section
of
the
pile.
in
other
words,
they
can't
segregate
it.
they
can't
identify
it
so
that
we
can
keep
it
separate
from
the
general
managing
property.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
well,
i
was
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
oh,
i
--
i
think
there's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
my
--
my
point
is
that
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
don't
believe
they
have.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
no,
sir.
i
don't.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
they
have
contended
all
along
that
the
state
of
ohio
could
not
apply
the
general
nondiscriminatory
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
against
their
iron
ore
because
that's
generally
protected
by
the
import
clause.
and
it
occurs
to
me
in
reading
over
the
cases
that
the
courts
have
consistently
made
examination
into
whether
or
not
the
identity
of
the
import
or
the
integrity
of
the
import
had
been
maintained.
now,
beginning
with
brown
against
maryland,
there
was
introduced
the
concept
of
the
original
package
doctrine.
now,
as
i've
said
before,
i
don't
think
it
need
be
restricted
by
any
imaginary
package.
i
think
that
the
important
thing
is
whether
or
not
the
importer
can
identify
the
import.
now,
whether
he
changed
it
in
its
form,
shape,
condition
or
extent
makes
no
difference
in
my
opinion
because
the
--
if
--
if
the
importer
buys
from
the
federal
government
a
protection
from
state
taxation
by
the
payment
of
the
import
duty,
he
certainly
bought
a
qualified
right.
in
other
words,
he
can
maintain
an
original
package
in
his
--
in
his
warehouse
so
long
if
he
does
not
disturb
the
package
or
so
long
if
he
does
not
sell
it.
but
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
pardon?
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
correct.
now,
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
well,
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
i've
cited
the
california
case
which
relied
upon
a
constructive
package
and
a
constructive
breaking
of
the
same
which
i
think
is
very
closely
analogous
to
our
factual
situation.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
at
page
25
of
the
record
questions
the
application
of
the
import
clause
to
situations
presented
as
this
one
is.
now,
i
personally
have
no
question
with
the
application,
but
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
was
--
was
sound
and
that
they
said
if
the
protection
exist,
it
certainly
cannot
extend
beyond
the
point
where
the
import
has
so
acted
upon
the
import
that
it
has
lost
its
identity
as
such.
in
other
words,
by
the
act
of
comingling
previous
shipments
with
the
instant
shipment
and
by
the
act
of
withdrawing
from
this
created
trial.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
the
purpose
of
the
importation
was
to
have
on-hand
the
--
i
believe
a
three
month
supply
of
iron
ore.
now,
if
you
read
the
statute
and
try
to
apply
it
to
the
operation
of
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
company,
it
can
come
to
only
one
conclusion
and
that
is
their
--
their
operation
fits
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
so
that
there
is
a
use
from
that
point
of
view.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
it
occurs
to
me
that
it
does,
yes.
the
only
thing
that
could
save
the
property
from
taxation
at
that
point
would
be
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
the
ohio
statute
could
not
be
applied
not
because
it
was
unconstitutional
but
because
the
import
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
prevented
the
application
of
the
ohio
statute.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
don't
believe
there
is,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
the
other
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
think
that
is
the
most
difficult
question
that
can
be
considered
in
connection
with
this
problem.
certainly,
under
my
view,
if
there
are
five
piles
created
and
only
one
of
them
is
disturbed
and
there's
no
comingling
withdrawal
from
the
other
four,
the
one
disturbed
here
would
have
lost
its
identity
as
an
import.
i
think
in
consideration
of
all
of
the
cases
in
the
import
clause
that
i
would
have
to
concede
that
if
brought
to
a
place
of
storage
not
comingled
with
other
previous
shipments
of
a
particular
grade
of
ore
and
not
disturbed
by
withdrawal
for
use
that
the
immunity
could
extend
to
that
point
for
those
parts.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
the
reason
the
question
is
difficult
for
me
to
answer
is
because
i
--
i
see
in
this
case
three
points.
the
termination
of
the
foreign
journey
of
this
ore,
in
other
words,
it's
arrived
at
its
destination
is
the
first
point.
the
second
point
is
the
comingling
with
other
ores
of
the
same
nature
and
the
third
is
the
withdraw.
and
the
reason
it's
difficult
is
because
i
think
the
most
important
things
are
the
latitude
factors,
the
comingling
and
the
withdraw
rather
than
the
fact
that
it's
arrived
at
its
destination.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
well,
perhaps
that's
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that
might.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
i
recognize
that
and
i
think
that
it's
just
--
if
you
permit
me
to
say
so,
an
easy
way
to
make
examination
of
whether
they
can
still
make
identification
of
their
import.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
are
you
referring,
sir,
to
domestic
ores?
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
i
would
be
glad
to
do
that
right
now.
it
occurs
to
me
that
domestic
ores
brought
in
to
ohio
for
use
in
manufacturing
are
taxable,
whether
a
resident
purchases
those
for
use
or
nonresident,
except
in
the
situation
where
under
5701.08,
a
nonresident
holds
this
property
in
storage
only
in
a
storage
warehouse.
now,
if
that
property
is
brought
to
the
place
where
this
be
--
is
to
be
used
in
manufacturing,
it
cannot
under
the
recent
grinnell
decision
in
167
ohio
state
report
be
considered
held
for
storage
only.
the
same
is
true
of
products
manufactured
and
kept
at
place
where
manufactured.
as
to
the
ore
of
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
company,
if
i
may
be
permitted,
i
would
make
one
comment
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
ohio
has
a
complete
system
of
personal
property
taxation.
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
tax
against
nonresidents
if
we
struck
the
exemption
of
the
proviso
in
5701.08.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
i
think
that
the
first
--
that
the
beginning
portion
of
that
statute
defines
use
in
business
is
a
complete
definition.
it
says
all
property
located
and
used
in
business
in
ohio
--
it
says
property
which
is
kept
on-hand
or
stored
or
used
in
the
ordinary
special
operations
of
the
business
and
so
forth.
i
don't
have
it
--
i
don't
have
it
before
me
but
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
that's
08.
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
definition
of
use
in
business.
now,
from
that
definition
--
thank
you
--
from
that
definition,
the
legislature
in
1933
saw
fit
to
carve
an
exception
or
an
exemption,
and
that
--
the
exemption
referred
only
to
nonresidents.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
it
begins
with
merchandise
or
agricultural
product.
yes,
sir.
is
not
used
in
business
in
the
state
if
held
in
a
storage
warehouse
for
storage
only.
now,
i
believe
that
the
proviso
add
it
as
it
were
in
1933
is
a
severable
part
of
the
statute.
now,
ohio
has
undertaken
--
the
ohio
legislature
has
undertaken
to
provide
the
mechanism
for
governing
situations
where
a
court
might
be
constrained
to
find
a
portion
of
a
statute
unconstitutional.
we
have
a
revised
code
section
of
--
ohio
revised
code
section
1.13
says
that
if
any
statute
or
any
part
of
the
statute
is
found
to
be
unconstitutional,
that
finding
shall
not
disturb
the
constitutionality
or
the
effectiveness
to
be
given
to
the
other
portions
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
without
regards
to
the
question
of
residence?
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
see.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
there's
no
dispute
that
the
property
is
located
in
ohio.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
the
question
is
whether
or
not
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
well,
i
understand
your
question.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
5701.08
says
when
property
is
acquired
or
held
as
means
or
instruments
for
carrying
on
the
business,
it's
used
in
business
within
ohio.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
the
grinnell
case
involved
10
nonresident
corporations
who
were
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
well,
the
question
did
not
come
up
in
that
way
in
the
grinnell
case.
i
was
just
saying
that
if
we
had
been
involved
with
a
nonresident,
the
ore
stored
at
ashtabula
for
use
at
youngstown
would
not
be
considered
use
in
business
because
it's
not
at
the
place
where
it
is
to
be
used.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
if
we're
dealing
with
a
nonresident.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
it
is
used
in
business
--
mr.
john
m.
tobin
--
it
was
required
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
the
business.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
tobin
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
that
that
has
been
questioned
as
far
as
a
resident
is
concerned
except
in
this
case
and
on
the
basis
of
equal
protection.
