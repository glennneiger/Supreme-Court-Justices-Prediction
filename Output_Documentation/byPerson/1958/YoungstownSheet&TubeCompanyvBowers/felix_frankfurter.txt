mr.

you
will
tell
us,
in
particularity,
the
fact
before
you
get
off

justice

the

and
the

from

--
justice

and
the
pile
--
what
would
be
the
duration
of
this
continuing
pile?
from
incoming
--
from
the
incoming
shipment,
is
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
as
a
matter
of
fact,
using
that
pile
certainly
(voice

--
justice
felix

is
there
adding
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
infer
insert
the
time
the
brazilian
or
(inaudible)
wasn't
standing
there
for
an
unlimited
time,
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
consumed
and
a
replenished
file
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
not
more
than
three
months
--
not
less
than
three-judge
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
continuous
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
when
they
assumed
it
wasn't
there
for
two
years,
it
hadn't
--
it
hadn't
become
as
it
were
localized
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
when
one
more
thing
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
it's
exacted
or
taxed?
was
the
tax
on
--
on
piles
that
--
for
all
one
knows
may
have
been
there
for
years
because
i
take
it
this
is
the
last
in,
first
out
so
far
as
new
systems
(inaudible),
is
it
--
would
it
be
that
at
the
bottom
it
might
be
there
forever,
it
might
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
tax
can
on
any
reasonable
basis,
it
couldn't
get
to
stockpiles
there
over
the
years
rather
than
current
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
whole
pile?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it
would
have
to
apply
the
stuff
that
you
take
out
currently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
on
the
january
assessment
basis,
it
might
have
been
on
board
and
has
been
there
for
five
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
the
tax
that
was
actually
levied
in
controversy
in
this
case
attributable?
is
it
fairly
to
be
attributed
to
piles
--
the
stock
that
has
been
there
for
five
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
whole
pile
have
been
there
five
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
my
question,
your
tax
on
those
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know,
could
that
whole
corpus
on
which
the
fact
of
this
case
have
been
there
five
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
you
answered
my
question
that
the
tax
couldn't
have
been
on
an
order
has
been
there
for
five
years
within
--
in
the
entire
time
that
you
were
taxed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
it
complete
and
different,
how
long
that
pile
has
been
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
you
know
the
state
make
a
differentiation
as
to
the
length
of
a
--
of
a
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
of
you
agree
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
no
different
than
you
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
my
question
is,
the
record
to
the
fact
that
it
--
my
mind
might
make
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
that
shows
that
we
ought
to
go
unpack
it
into
the
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all,
the
package
isn't
--
if
this
happened
to
be
a
breakable
entity
and
chief
justice
marshall
began
to
talk
about
it.
but
package
isn't
a
legal
conception
or
is
it
in
the
constitution?
what's
all
this
about?
we
have
to
find,
we
have
to
analogize
all
sorts
of
package
in
order
to
sustain
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
it
about?
what
the
decision
that
we
have
been
arguing,
this
is
or
is
what
package
and
whether
it
is
or
isn't
breakable
except
taking
part
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
doesn't
understand
that,
but
when
--
you
talk
about
ore
being
a
package,
my
imagination
--
in
the
limited
lawyer's
imagination
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
the
youngstown
sheet
company
buy
a
lot
of
ore
in
a
cheap
commodity
market,
a
market
we've
had
recently,
and
put
it
away.
you
wouldn't
claim
exemption
from
it?
just
assume
facilities
are
available
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
that
metallurgically,
there
wouldn't
be
a
evaporation
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
it
away
because
the
market,
it's
been
low,
it's
been
--
to
buy
in
the
market,
so
they
stored
it
away.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
pay
any
less.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
put
it
--
buy
it
and
store
it
away
for
use
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
how
do
we
decide
these
things
unless
we
go
to
the
purpose
of
this
constitutional
provision?
this
wasn't
a
technical
clause
that
the
framers
put
in,
has
been
the
purpose
in
our
federal
scheme.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
the
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
grant
this
question
to
find
out
what
--
it
does
make
to
me
a
lot
of
reference
whether
youngstown
buys
a
lot
of
ore
and
puts
it
away
for
--
for
indefinite
future
because
the
--
it's
a
cheap
buy
and
it
has
facility,
but
still
that
to
me
is
a
very
different
thing,
from
restocking
and
currently
using
it
in
its
manufacturing
process.
it
was
a
very
different
thing
to
me
at
least.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
you've
got
value
as
against
that
the
facts
that
the
stock
is
still
within
the
state
and
the
state
would
need
money
to
run
it
ashore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
did
i
understood
to
say
that
apart
from
this
special
exemption,
nonresidents
stand
in
separate
class,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
your
grievance
here?
your
record
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed,
therefore,
you
come
within
the
taxing
power
to
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
an
exception
in
the
statute
to
nonresidents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
questioned
this
--
this
claim
of
denial
of
equal
protection
is
not
available
to
you
because
they
would
work
the
statute
beyond
way
and
hold
invalid
insofar
as
it's
(inaudible)
nonresident,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
say
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
if
the
court
should
say
that,
that
wouldn't
help
you
any,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
in
any
event,
that
really
would
strike
the
exception
down,
but
it
couldn't
impose
a
tax.
and
therefore,
it
goes
tax
free
of
taxation
under
the
ohio
legislature
act,
but
in
the
mean
time,
they'd
come
down
on
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you,
yourself
have
no
grievance
except
that
some
other
people
aren't
included
and
that
constitutes
the
unequal
protection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
the
--
the
state's
notion
of
inducing
nonresidents
who
come
into
ohio,
aren't
that
a
fair
classification,
every
state
tries
to
attract
more
capital.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
there
is
a
different
relation
to
the
state,
is
it
not?
but
where
is
the
sufficient
reason,
your
company
took
out
on
ohio
a
challenge
and
now
a
delaware
charge
then
from
some
other
states.
why
can't
the
ohio
state
--
this
is
an
inducement
to
get
foreign
capital
either
to
stay
here
to
expand
it's
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
upshot
of
what
you've
said
that
the
nonresident
would
also
be
taxable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
if
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
taft
had
turned
out
what
he
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
had
rephrased
that
and
if
he
hadn't
held
that
that
is
on
coming,
that
this
--
that
that
is
constitutional
and
therefore
must
be
stricken.
would
he
have
gone
on
and
said
the
objection
of
unequal
protection
is
gone
because
both
now,
having
stricken
this,
both
residents
and
nonresidents
are
equally
taxable.
is
that
what
i'm
to
incur?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
would
follow.
that's
your
position,
mr.
saxbe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
other
way
around.
not
the
other
way
around
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
though
that's
stricken
leaving
the
nonresident
free,
that's
immaterial
because
he's
not
a
nonresident.
that
is
not
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
the
periods
during
which
the
goodrich
case
covered
nonresidents
during
--
nonresidents
as
declined
by
your
supreme
court,
could
take
advantage
of
or
rather
insist
exactly
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
that
period,
if
there
is
any
validity
to
the
distinction
to
the
claim
of
unequal
protection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
that
period,
that
claim
would
be
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
denied
it
--
that
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
changed
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
those
were
the
period
--
during
the
period
of
the
supreme
court,
your
supreme
court
decision
held
this
way.
you
can't
rely
on
that
because
your
supreme
court
said
that's
what
the
statute
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
matter.
but
during
that
period,
a
resident
can
say,
"i'm
being
discriminated
again."
in
view
of
the
goodrich
holding
unless
you
justify
the
discrimination
as
being
fair
classification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
--
the
question
here
in
this
case
(inaudible)
is
the
question
we're
just
discussing,
namely
the
claim
of
unequal
treatment
within
the
scope
of
the
goodrich
case,
is
that
before
us,
in
the
instant
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
to
meet
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
court
we
construct
an
ohio
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
respect
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
he
called
creative
jurisprudence,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
haven't
a
great
part
of
this
country
was
built
up
on
that
sea
of
taxation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
immunity
from
taxation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
nine
members
of
the
court,
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
attorney
general,
is
there
any
light
at
all
on
whether
or
not
this
tax
exemption
statute
under
this
(inaudible)
33,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
talking
about
it.
in
fact,
attracting
nonresidents
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
there
any
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
the
record,
but
in
documents
or
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
justice
mckenna
about
that
time
used
the
phrase,
a
hearing
from
judgment
by
speculation
and
judgment
by
experience.
so
it's
in
fact,
it
has
worked
out
so
as
to
induce
outside
the
property
to
come
in.
that
may
justify,
but
otherwise
would
be
abstractive
justify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
tax
makes
no
discrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
covers
the
pile.
justice
felix
frankfurter
covers
the
pile.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there's
an
attack
on
that
ground
because
it's
included
in
the
whole
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
--
there's
no
differentiation
making
such
as
my
question
implies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
discuss
at
all
the
time
of
--
locate
the
period,
the
duration
of
the
pile?
do
they
make
any
distinction
whether
ohio
could
tax
ore
that
came
in
a
day
before
that
against
ore
that
might
be
--
have
been
lodged
there
for
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
import
clause
hasn't
been
restricted
to
that?
the
specific
form
of
grievance
which
led
to
the
import
clause,
has
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
decisions
of
this
court
hasn't
said,
"we
only
look
to
whether
it's
a
seaboard
state."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
--
suppose
this
--
this
--
the
youngstown
people
or
some
other
manufacturers
in
ohio
bringing
in
raw
materials
from
the
out
--
from
foreign
countries
to
--
to
gain
importation
and
manufacture
as
to
use,
as
to
have
the
stock
brought
in
at
short
periods,
say
within
a
week
of
the
consumption,
it's
deposited,
comes
in
by
train
and
deposit
it
on
a
pile,
and
is
used
within
a
week,
used
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
position?
is
your
position
ohio
could
tax
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
“by
the
abstract”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that,
taxation
is
a
least
of
that
structure,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i'm
singularly
ignorant
of
that.
i'm
just
assuming
that
all
or
other
raw
materials
are
brought
in
and
are
consumed
after
being
deposited
at
the
pile
within
a
week
of
being
deposited.
i
don't
believe
that
the
time
factor
is
significant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it?
suppose
it
remained
--
suppose
it
you'd
count
it
on
clause
and
shut
it
off
on
the
sighting
by
the
manufacturer
and
kept
in
the
car
which
brought
it
in
until
it's
--
until
it's
gone
into
the
process
of
manufacturing.
if
that
doesn't,
a
box
car
content?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
used
it
within
a
short
time,
the
stuff
that's
in
the
car
is
undecided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
--
will
you
do
some
--
for
me
a
branding
de
facto.
i
hadn't
realized
there
was
any
question
at
all
this
pile
was
unquestionably
cuban,
mexican,
liberian
or
--
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
isn't
there
identification
of
importation
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
imported
by
youngstown?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
at
all.
i
understood
that
all
of
it
is
cuban
ore.
it's
identified
by
the
nature
of
the
commodity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
somebody
is
taking
ore
doesn't
lose
the
identification
of
what
is
left.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
not
reimportation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unlike
justice
harlan,
i
get
to
--
the
package
seems
to
be
quite
and
irrelevant
and
confusing,
a
relevant
phrase
in
the
brown
case.
why
do
we
have
to
keep
on
talking
packages
when
there
are
no
packages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
there's
an
import
clause.
you
can't
confuse
the
scope
and
purpose
of
that
by
talking
about
packages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
notion
that
i'm
restricted
in
my
putting,
that
was
the
defendant
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
they
--
haven't
they
raised
though
that
this
is
all
importation
and
it's
still
part
of
the
process
of
importation
and
therefore,
none
of
it
is
taxable?

and
because
i
may
not
agree
with
them
that
none
of
it
is
taxable,
are
not
precluded
from
agreeing
with
them
that
some
of
it
is
not
taxable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
they
attacking
this
is
as
unconstitutional?
it's
unconstitutionally
dependent
on
arguments
or
on
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
source
of
all
these
original
packaging?
in
the
brown
case,
there
happens
to
be
packages.
the
statute
of
maryland
was
directed
against
importing
of
things
in
bales
or
packages,
and
the
particular
imported
there
or
in
packages
of
dry
goods.
but
the
case
as
it
turn
out,
anything
that
has
to
do
with
packages
as
such
has
to
do
with
the
scope
and
purpose
of
the
import
clause.
there
was
a
package
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
the
law.
that's
when
cases
take
a
word
off
in
the
opinion
and
i
think
that's
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
--
how
long
is
the
process
of
air-drying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
in
the
record
as
to
what
it
is
on
which
the
tax
fell?
how
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
do
you
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
six
months
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
there
--
how
do
we
know
whether
the
tax
falls
on
the
lumber
as
imported?
before
it
aerated
or
after?
is
that
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
lumber
that
came
in
--
you
don't
know
--
you
can't
tell
how
long
it
takes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
others
that's
found
(inaudible)
on
may
1st?
justice
felix
frankfurter
air-dried
or
not,
will
it
be
taxed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
the
record
--
is
the
record
clear
that
the
taxing
authorities
purposefully
abstained
from
taxing
green
lumber?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
criteria
in
which
the
tax
is
imposed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
the
record
indicate
why
it
didn't
assess
all
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
very
often,
the
tax
doesn't
fall
on
the
total
amount
of
property
taxes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
about
the
general
taxing
incident?
algoma
isn't
--
it
tax
only
half
of
every
--
every
kind
of
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)is
very
light
on
that
question
(inaudible)
green
or
not
a
green
lumber.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
one
more
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
air-drying
is
just
the
operation
you
mentioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
for
wood
importation
(inaudible)
to
be
committed
to
a
manufacturing
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
hence,
if
there's
no
work,
you
--
it
wouldn't
function
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
something
is
in
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
something
is
in
here
that
has
been
added.
and
that
doesn't
come
from
wisconsin,
that's
the
nature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
does
that
--
the
theory
apply
or
is
an
inevitable
(inaudible)
almost
an
inevitable
(inaudible)
manufacturer
import
the
raw
commodity
and
(inaudible)
the
importation,
the
few
--
the
quick
--
quick
immediate
assumptions
that
the
raw
materials
introduce
that
those
raw
materials
were
committed
for
the
immediate
use
would
not
be
subject
to
the
import
clause
(inaudible)
from
the
limitations
upon
state
of
import
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
which
is
--
that
which
is
used
immediately
would
be
taxable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
small
manufacturer
who
doesn't
have
a
large
reserve
of
raw
materials
is
at
a
disadvantage,
he'd
be
taxed,
whereas
the
big
manufacturer
who
can
have
a
reserve
would
not
be
taxed.
so
that's
not
committed
for
immediate
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
that
discrimination
is
a
complication
(inaudible)
of
life,
what
i
ask
to
you
is
whether
you're
asking
us
to
draw
a
line
that
inevitably
would
hit
the
small
seller
who
can't
have
a
good
reserve,
a
good
inventory
of
his
raw
materials
but
the
big
seller
who
can
pile
it
up,
he
would
be
taxed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
your
basis
of
immediate
operational
needs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
talks
about
the
import
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
was
committed
is
the
stuff
that's
imported
is
being
manufactured,
that's
committed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
orders
fall
off
and
it
didn't
go
the
manufacturers,
then
it
isn't
committed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
what
was
said
would
be
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
for
you
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
just
--
the
chief
justice
taney
was
in
(inaudible)
be
good
position
to
know
what
brown
against
maryland
meant.
(inaudible)
the
case
from
maryland
had
changed
his
mind.
that
became
really
to
think
about
it
otherwise
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
been
any
--
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
been
a
conflict
in
decision
in
this
court
in
allowing
state
to
tax
imported
goods
in
terms
other
than
the
one
you
just
quoted
from
the
license
tax
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
don't
judge
cases
by
picking
word
here
and
there.
it's
different
in
style
in
men's
writing,
some
people
are
valuable
and
some
people
are
like
--
with
a
guilty
conscience
to
say
that.
some
people
of
city
but
the
question
is
what
had
been
the
decision?
now,
will
you
point
to
any
conflict
in
decision
in
brown
against
maryland
that
contradicts
the
interpretation
of
the
chief
justice
taney's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
have
been
that
they
have
been
deciding
cases
at
least
not
in
this
court.
