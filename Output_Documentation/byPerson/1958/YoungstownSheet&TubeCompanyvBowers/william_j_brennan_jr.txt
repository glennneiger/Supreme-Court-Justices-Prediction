william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
purpose
of
keeping
them
in
those
different
piles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
--
did
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker
that
the
assessment
is
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
quantity
refers
to
some
date
of
each
month
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
last
day
of
each
month.
so
that
--
is
that
to
say
that
the
assessment
in
fact
is
not
the
assessment
against
a
particular
pile
as
of
a
given
date,
but
rather
a
--
an
assessment
measured
in
the
manner
you
stated
on
the
whole
years
intake
divided
by
12
as
of
the
quantities
of
different
dates
but
the
same
date
of
each
month,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
really
getting
at
is
this.
a
house
sits
there
all
the
time
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
assessment
on
the
house,
i
take
it,
is
an
assessment
against
that
particular
house.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
get
that
kind
of
assessment
period,
do
you,
against
the
exact
quantity
on
hand
on
a
given
tax
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
would
this
possible
--
what
is
your
tax
day?
is
there
a
tax
day,
an
assessment
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
i
might
understand
that
it
might
be
possible
that
you
would
have,
if
the
assessment
date
is
as
of
the
first
whatsoever
month.
you
might
have
11
months
with
something
on
hand,
but
nothing
on
hand
on
the
first
of
january
and
yet
have
an
assessment
computed
the
amount
of
the
year.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
other
words,
there
has
to
be
something
on
hand
as
of
the
first
month.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
so,
it's
not
like
the
house,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
you
think
the
chief
justice
in
this
supreme
court
(inaudible)[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
appendix
b
of
your
adversary's
brief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
really
your
answer
to
the
contention
of
your
adversary
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
really
your
answer
to
your
adversary's
contention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
why
you
throw
all
these
in
the
plaintiff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
just
ask
just
out
of
curiosity.
what
--
what's
the
amended
statute?
what
does
it
now
provide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
nonresident
corporations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
limit
of
the
--
that
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
--
i
--
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
about
this.
as
of
a
given
date,
is
that
the
pile
as
it
sits
in
place
the
tax
--
what
--
of
course,
i
--
the
--
do
you
have
a
specific
tax
date
as
of
which
january
1,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
the
pile
on
the
1st
of
january
is
very
big
or
very
small
in
relation
to
the
size
of
the
pile
on
the
1st
of
any
other
month
of
the
year,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
(inaudible)
you're
saying
the
supreme
court
had
(inaudible)
the
grinnell
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
question,
stored
and
(inaudible)
under
your
ohio
supreme
court
decision,
is
this
ore
used
in
the
business
of
youngstown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
nonresident?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
dealing
with
a
resident,
it
is
your
position
that
it
is
and
would
not
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
not
have
a
determination
to
that
effect
in
your
interpretation
of
your
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that
shipment
is
actually
compelled
which
shipment
arrives
in
one
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
(inaudible)
made
of
separate
pile
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
to
make
a
separate
pile,
say,
lumber
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
by
looking
at
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
was
there
a
finding
below
that
the
stack
in
the

(inaudible)
manufacturing

of
the

actually
had
begun

how
about
the

william
