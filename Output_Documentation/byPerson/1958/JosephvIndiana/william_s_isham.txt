isham.
mr.
william
s.
isham
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
--
members
of
the
court.
this
case
covers
on
here
as
a
result
of
a
partial
certiorari
being
granted
on
petition
resulting
from
a
conviction
for
murder
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
i
have
been
appointed
attorney
in
forma
pauperis
by
the
court.
i
think
in
fairness
to
all
of
us
and
particularly
in
light
of
my
peculiar
employment,
i
should
say
this.
before
i
start
in
on
some
particular
aspects
of
this
case,
that
i
am
in
a
truly
unique
position.
i
think
i
am
in
a
position
here
representing
these
men
and
i
--
i
apprehend
it's
my
duty
to
do
the
best
thing
for
them.
i
am
in
a
position
where
if
i
succeeded
in
having
this
court
today,
hold
with
me,
on
the
proposition
that
these
confessions
were
improperly
admitted
because
of
violating
the
due
process
clause,
that
i
would,
in
effect,
defeat
the
very
quickest
and
most
sure
way
from
my
clients
to
get
out
of
prison.
i
would
simply
prolong
their
long
trip
there
where
they've
already
been
for
25
years,
because
i
apprehend
the
court
would
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
remanded
for
trial
again.
trial
again
is
not
going
to
help
these
men.
they
have
been
through
the
trial
again,
time
and
again.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
briefly
give
the
court
a
little
outline
of
the
historical
facts
in
this
case,
which
i
feel
are
very
pertinent
in
discussing
the
question
of
the
confession
at
a
little
later
stage.
these
two
men
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
your
honor,
they
don't
want
a
new
trial.
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
want
a
new
trial.
they
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial,
as
i
shall
point
out
here,
in
indiana
because
it
was
the
only
procedural
method
to
have
an
exhaustion
of
their
state
remedies
in
order
to
get
under
the
federal
court
on
a
matter
of
habeas
corpus.
and
what
do
the
indiana
court
do
behold?
it
granted
a
new
trial.
a
judge
who
had
never
heard
the
case,
14
years
later,
granted
a
new
trial.
now,
the
only
reason
the
motion
was
filed,
as
i
shall
point
out,
is
because
that
is
the
only
way
in
indiana
that
one
may
have
an
appellate
review
of
most
of
his
conviction.
anything
relating
to
the
trial
itself
must
be
done
through
the
implementation
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
behold
the
court
granted
a
new
trial.
they
were
then
in
the
dilemma
of
having
to
go
through
a
new
trial,
go
through
a
new
trial
17
years
after
the
facts
occurred
in
this.
mr.
william
s.
isham
no,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
that.
permit
me
to
start
at
the
beginning
and
i
think
it
will
clarify
itself
with
it.
to
begin
with,
these
men
were
--
were
in
an
apartment
in
indianapolis
on
february
22nd,
a
significant
day
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
1935.
no,
no.
they
weren't
--
in
1935,
they're
--
in
december
7th,
1935
they're
in
an
apartment
in
indianapolis.
both
of
these
men
were
fugitives
from
justice.
they'd
escape
from
the
indiana
penitentiary.
they
were
young
men
at
the
time.
they
were
fugitives
from
justice.
too
plainclothes
policemen
came
there
without
warrant,
rap
on
the
door,
the
door
was
opened
and
in
a
semi-lit
room,
there
was
a
lot
of
shooting
occurred.
now,
one
of
the
men,
the
--
or
the
plainclothesman,
one
of
the
men
was
shot
in
the
belly
and
died
on
the
18th
of
december,
that's
11
days
afterward.
both
of
the
two
defendants
pierce
and
--
and
joseph
were
shot.
pierce
was
shot
through
the
chest
the
bullet
going
in
one
side
that
coming
out
the
other.
david
was
shot
under
his
left
arm
and
the
bullet
coming
out
in
his
back.
now
that
they
got
away
from
the
police
and
on
the
10th
of
december
at
2:30
a.m.,
the
state
police
apprehended
them.
they
were
in
their
underwear.
they
were
pulled
out
of
bed
and
were
taken
to
the
state
police
barracks
in
indianapolis
on
the
10th.
they
have
had
no
medical
attention
in
the
meantime.
they
had
attempted
to
put
some
mercurochrome
on
their
wounds
themselves.
naturally,
they
were
afraid
to
go
to
a
doctor
and
--
and
exhibit
bullet
wounds.
so,
then
on
the
10th
of
december
at
about
10
o'clock
in
the
morning,
after
being
there
all
night,
they
were
turned
over
to
the
city
police
of
indianapolis.
now,
the
city
police
--
the
city
policeman,
was
a
policeman
who
got
shot
and
who
ultimately
dies.
they
were
turned
over
to
his
cohorts,
his
pals
in
the
same
police
force
for
questioning.
now
--
now,
after
a
time
which
i
shall
go
into
a
more
detail
in
a
minute,
they
signed
two
writings
purporting
to
be
confessions,
detailing
some
factors
which
laded
on
them
for
--
for
first
degree
murder
instead
of
at
most,
a
manslaughter,
or
assault
and
battery
with
intent.
now
--
now
then,
this
case
was
ultimately
tried
in
--
on
february
22nd,
1936
and
they
were
convicted
that
day
of
first
degree
murder.
immediately
they
were
taken
to
the
indiana
penitentiary.
in
indiana,
we
have
a
--
a
right
to
appeal.
every
man
has
a
right
to
appeal
from
a
criminal
conviction
as
a
matter
of
right.
to
appeal,
he
has
to
file
first
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
within
30
days.
at
the
time
this
occurrence
in
1936,
the
courts
had
held
if
you
do
not
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
30
days,
you're
out
of
luck.
you
both
waived
it
and
the
supreme
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
about
it
to
correct
it.
now,
that's
in
1936.
these
men
were
taken
after
the
prison.
they
were
put
in
a
solitary
confinement
up
here,
the
day
after
they
were
convicted.
and
they
went
along
for
a
period
of
days
which
ate
up
the
30
days.
they
had
no
opportunity
to
communicate
with
anybody.
they
were
held
completely
incommunicado
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
they
had
counsel
at
the
trial,
your
honor.
he
was
a
pauperis
attorney
such
as
i
am
and
he
did
not
file
a
motion
for
new
trial,
which,
i
think,
answers
it
if
you
call
out
a
lawyer,
i
don't.
he
didn't
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
william
s.
isham
life
conviction
for
first
degree
murder.
now
then
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes,
we
do
have,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
now
then,
in
1948,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
never
heard
of
it
not
being
done,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
the
question
answers
itself,
does
it
not,
if
why,
of
course,
anybody
where
--
where
a
matter
of
a
man's
life
is
at
stake
would
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
so
and
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case
and
these
men,
the
defendants,
wanted
a
new
trial.
and
they
tried
to
get
a
new
trial.
they
tried
their
best
to
communicate.
they
even
--
and
the
evidence
in
another
case
which
is
in
--
went
through
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
william
s.
isham
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
isham
it's
automatic
in
any
case.
any
criminal
case
providing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
filed
timely
and
--
and
secondly
that
the
appeal
is
perfected
within
--
in
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
no.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
right.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes,
it's
true.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that
is
not
the
situation
in
indiana.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
right.
now,
your
honor,
though,
modifying
that
statement,
in
1948,
for
the
first
time,
now
that
was
--
that
was
12
years
after
they
--
it
was
13
years
after
they've
been
in
the
penitentiary.
the
case
of
--
of
walker
against
state
was
decided,
which
held
that
under
certain
circumstances,
one
might
petition
the
court
where
the
case
had
been
tried
at
a
later
date
and
have
a
belated
motion
for
a
new
trial
filed
which
could
then
be
processed
into
an
appeal.
now
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
right.
however,
that
case
didn't
prescribe
pretty
well
the
--
the
factors
necessary
to
get
that
done.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that
--
no,
your
honor.
it
had
not.
in
that
--
on
that
story
let
me
say.
that's
just
one
of
the
evolutionary
processes
we've
been
through
in
indiana
particularly
trying
to
get
the
court
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
basically
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes,
it's
case
law
and
basically,
the
ground
for
getting
a
belated
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
the
allegation
of
facts
under
oath
which
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
either
the
due
process
clause
or
the
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
william
s.
isham
1948.
within
three
months
after
that
case
was
decided,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
a
--
a
petition
was
filed
for
leave
to
file
a
belated
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
court
below.
the
state
of
indiana
demurred
to
the
petition
and
the
lower
court
overruled
the
demurrer.
then
the
state
of
indiana
brought
an
original
action
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
seeking
to
get
a
writ
of
prohibition,
prohibiting
that
court
from
passing
upon
the
validity
of
this
petition
for
filling
a
belated
motion.
that
was
denied.
prohibition
was
denied.
then
the
state
of
indiana
came
in
after
its
demurrer
to
the
--
the
petition
had
been
ruled
upon
and
asked
leave
to
amend
its
demurrer
which
was
granted.
they
amended
the
demurrer
and
the
lower
court
sustained
the
demurrer.
there
was
an
appeal
taken
by
joseph
in
that
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
and
the
court
there
held,
that
the
demurrer
--
that
they
--
he
reversed
the
case.
and
in
that
case,
he
cited
--
the
supreme
court
cited
the
case
of
cochran
against
kansas,
which
was
the
--
where
the
appeal
papers
of
a
prisoner
were
suppressed
by
the
state
and
also
cited
the
case
of
dowd,
warden
against
cook,
which
i
argued
in
this
court
some
seven
or
eight
years
ago,
involving
the
same
sort
of
question.
so
the
thing
was
sent
back
to
the
court
again.
and
that
time
the
court
granted
the
petition
for
leave
to
file
a
belated
motion
for
a
new
trial.
now,
that
occurred
--
that's
along
1953.
now,
they've
been
in
there
since
--
they've
been
there
18
years.
so,
the
petition
was
then
--
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
the
belated
motion
was
filed.
now,
it
was
a
formal
--
little
formal
motion
and
the
court
sustained
the
motion
granting
a
new
trial
on
june
29th,
1953.
now
that
was
--
you
see
three
and
15,
that's
18
years
after
this
shooting
occurred.
they
are
then
granted
the
right
to
have
a
trial
in
a
state
that
has
a
constitutional
and
statutory
requirement
that
every
man
has
a
right
to
speedy
justice,
18
years.
mr.
william
s.
isham
the
--
they
are
not
permitted
the
filing
of
the
motions
for
a
new
trial
and
they
couldn't
go
ahead
with
it,
you
see.
mr.
william
s.
isham
your
honor,
there
is
evidence,
although
not
in
this
case.
it's
in
another
case,
which
i'll
explain
about
a
second.
there
is
an
affidavit
of
the
deputy
warden
that
these
men
and
it
was
introduced
in
the
case
in
the
hancock
circuit
court
for
leave
to
file
a
belated
motion
that
these
men
had
tried,
they'd
even
prepared
a
crude
motion
for
a
new
trial
up
there
with
some
guardhouse
lawyers
and
they
would
let
him
send
it
out.
and
they've
tried
to
and
tried
to,
until
the
time
it
expired
and
then
it
was
a
pure
knowledge.
they
could
do
nothing
until
1948
when
this
new
rule
of
law
was
first
announced.
mr.
william
s.
isham
after
the
30
days
had
expired,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
isham
until
1948
and
they
did
that
within
--
within
60
days
on
the
day
that
the
supreme
court
decision
was
handed
down.
now,
of
course,
what
the
position
that
i
have
taken
in
respect
to
the
interest
of
these
men,
they've
been
there,
they're
bothered
to
celebrate
their
silver
jubilee
in
the
penitentiary.
and
most
of
his
time,
they've
been
there,
why?
because
of
a
violation
by
the
state
of
indiana
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
william
s.
isham
your
honor,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
and
that's
why
i
say
i'm
in
this
dilemma.
actually,
this
was
argued
in
the
indiana
supreme
court
in
this
very
decision.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
of
course,
this
is
simply
the
record
of
evidence
in
a
murder
trial.
it
wouldn't
have
been
admissible
in
that
case.
however,
we
sought
to
have
the
court
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
statements
in
its
own
opinions
and
then
they
have
two
other
opinions
which
do
setout
all
these
facts.
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
that's
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
both
--
both
that's
right.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
right.
now,
i
--
i
am
sorry
i've
taken
so
much
time
telling
you
this
story,
but
i
do
--
i
do
feel
that
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
oh,
yes.
there
was
a
new
trial
and
jury
disagree.
we
would
try
it
again
and
--
and
they
convicted
them
of
second
degree
murder.
mr.
william
s.
isham
they've
got
life
after
they've
been
there
18
years
or
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
oh
yes.
they're
up
there
unbailable
and
there
they
are
--
now,
what
i'm
saying
to
this
court
is
this.
mr.
william
s.
isham
the
--
[laughs]
the
provision
for
a
parole
is
that
any
man
who
is
in
prison
and
tries
to
get
out
on
a
charge
of
violating
the
state,
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
no
right
of
parole.
it
never
paroled
one
yet
and
they
never
will,
your
honor.
now,
that's
what
these
men
are
up
to.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
a
practice.
that's
right.
and
it
is
a
universal
practice.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that
is
right.
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
would
love
to
bring
him
here,
your
honor.
i
--
i
say
that
it
is
not
here.
nevertheless,
it
is
part
of
my
problem.
it
is
very
definitely
part
of
my
problem
because
if
the
court
here
follows
my
reasoning
on
the
question
of
the
inadmissibility
of
this
confession
it's
going
to
remand
it
back
for
a
new
trial
and
we
still
haven't
exhausted
our
state
remedy
so
we
can't
get
back.
we
can't
get
in
to
the
federal
court
until
that
has
been
done
which
would
probably
take
two
more
years.
now,
that's
the
position
i'm
in.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
mr.
william
s.
isham
they
did
in
the
opinion,
but
they
did
add
this.
and
it's
--
it's
correct,
the
only
basis
for
my
--
i
argued
this
case
before
the
supreme
court.
the
only
basis
for
arguing
that
before
the
supreme
court,
mind
you
this
was
an
appeal
from
a
murder
conviction,
the
third
trial,
was
that
the
supreme
court
had
written
two
opinions
before
which
they
could
and
should
take
judicial
knowledge
in
the
contents
of
which
and
that
in
doing
that,
they
would
then
have
all
the
facts
before
them
where
they
could
have
released
this
--
these
men.
but
they
--
they
didn't
do
that
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
well
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
not
with
the
preliminary
evidence
it
was
at
before.
but
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
why
they
couldn't
have
other
evidence
showing
that
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
my
dilemma
is
this.
mr.
william
s.
isham
if
you
--
no.
it's
just
going
to
delay,
your
honor.
it's
going
to
delay
my
getting
the
question
which
i
think
is
the
most
meritorious
question
they
have
into
the
lap
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
william
s.
isham
well
--
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
they
would
be
convicted.
and
it
would
certainly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
think
these
men
would
be
convicted
in
indiana
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
there
is
evidence,
yes.
there
is
evidence
upon
which
conviction
could
be
sustained
and
probably
would
be
sustained.
mr.
william
s.
isham
no,
your
honor.
now
--
now,
let's
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
now,
i
--
i
cannot
follow
that
reasoning
at
all.
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
where
you
have
a
--
where
you
have
constitutional
statutory
provisions
for
immediate
trial
and
you
give
them
an
18-year
delay
in
there,
due
to
the
fault
of
the
state,
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
fugitives.
they
were
in
--
they
were
in
custody
of
the
state
all
that
time.
now
then,
to
simply
say
why
you
got
that
same
old
trial
that
you
would
have
got
if
you'd
want
in
the
first
instance,
that's
not
the
answer,
that's
the
very
thing
the
indiana
supreme
court
said.
and
to
me
--
to
me
certainly
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
--
it
has
been
logical.
mr.
william
s.
isham
no.
my
dilemma
is
that
if
--
if
this
court
holds
that
--
that
this
is
to
be
retried
it
certainly
is
another
two
years
stay
before
we
can
get
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
william
s.
isham
we're
going
to
have
to
go
through
all
this
again.
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
don't
know.
they
might
or
they
might
not.
i
can't
--
i
can't
escape
this
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
isham
no,
no.
oh,
no.
mr.
william
s.
isham
oh,
if
they
are
acquitted.
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
--
i
didn't
understand
you.
well
certainly.
mr.
william
s.
isham
certainly.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
s.
isham
without
asking
you
what
to
do,
i
wish
you'd
affirm
this
judgment.
i
don't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
standing
here
and
saying,
"i
want
the
court
to
do
this."
i
don't
want
to
make
informal
admission
because
i
don't
want
to
have
to
eat
that
in
some
court
in
the
--
in
the
federal
system
[laughs]
saying
that
i
waived
any
rights
or
i
--
i
am
a
stop
to
assert
the
rights
that
i
think
should
be
presented
here.
they
aren't
presented
by
this
record;
they
really
aren't.
the
fact
that
these
men
--
the
fact
that
these
men
were
a
--
one
man
shot
a
policeman
is
--
is
a
fact
that
is
tremendous
in
--
in
my
picture
of
this
whole
thing.
if
ever
you're
going
to
shoot
anybody,
never
shoot
a
policeman.
and
here,
were
the
same
group
of
--
of
policemen,
indianapolis
city
police,
who
were
--
who
questioned
and
--
and
handled
these
men
getting
the
--
the
confession
out
of
them.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
your
honor,
we
had
to
do
it
to
exhaust
our
state
remedies
before
we
could
get
in
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus.
as
i
understand,
filing
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
having
it
denied
is
now
held
to
be
a
state
remedy
which
has
to
be
exhausted
before
you
can
proceed
in
the
federal
system.
now,
there
was
a
time
when
it
wasn't.
mr.
william
s.
isham
it
was
a
very
unpersuasive
[laughs]
petition,
your
honor.
very
unpersuasive,
it
was
great
they
liked
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
william
s.
isham
it
got
us
here.
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
am
--
no,
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
all
through.
i
shall
then
immediately
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana
federal
court.
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
i
hope,
the
state
goes
from
there
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
because
i
think
there's
a
very
clear
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
here.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes,
your
honor.
if
you
remember
in
the
--
in
the
dowd
against
cook
case,
judge
--
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
opinion.
it
was
admitted
that
there
had
been
a
constitutional
violation
of
--
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
kept
that
man
from
perfecting
an
appeal
that
every
other
citizen
of
indiana
had
a
right
to
for
17
years.
now,
then,
the
question
that
arose,
having
done
that,
what
is
the
proper
remedy?
and
this
court
held
that
if
he
could
get
a
full
and
complete
review
of
his
initial
conviction
and
if
the
supreme
court
then
affirmed
it,
why
he
couldn't
have
been
heard
and,
of
course,
he
couldn't
have
been.
he
was
there
for
life,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
about
a
17-year
delay
for
the
affirmance
of
a
conviction,
of
the
initial
conviction.
but
to
grant
him
a
new
trial
17
years
later,
he's
been
in
prison
for
17
years.
what
facility
does
he
for
collecting
evidence?
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
a
--
that's
a
pretty
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
--
concise
statement
of
what
i'm
saying
about
that,
your
honor.
now,
i've
--
i've
used
up
my
time
and
i
haven't
once
discussed
the
other
thing.
if
the
court
wishes,
i
can
spend
five
minutes
out
of
the
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
i've
used
up
my
time.
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
have
not
yet
discussed
the
other
question.
mr.
william
s.
isham
it's
our
contention
--
it's
our
contention
here
that
this
confession
was
the
type
of
confession
that
was
talked
about
in
the
watts
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
coat
of
many
colors,
the
issue
of
fact,
the
coat
of
many
colors.
we
even
have
--
we
even
have
one
of
the
parties
here,
his
name
is
joseph.
now,
in
this
case,
it
must
be
remembered
that
these
witnesses
were
testifying
as
to
events
which
occurred
18
years
before
they
testified.
there
was
no
record
made
of
the
first
trial
at
all.
that
was
not
available
to
them.
it
was
that
kind
of
evidence.
you
have
police
detectives
interrogating,
separately,
men
who
were
injured,
who
would
have
no
medical
attention
for
at
least
three
days,
who
certainly
had
infected
wounds,
there's
no
denial
of
that.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
or
a
shot
clear
through.
they
were
being
interrogated
by
the
associates
of
the
man
who
was
shot.
now,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that's
a
place
where
the
court
could
qualify
the
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
watts
case,
that
we
can't
deny,
as
judges,
things
we
know
as
men.
now,
i
don't
care
how
beautiful
the
language
was
about
the
little
pollyanna
talk
that
they
testified
they
had
with
these
prisoners,
but
here
are
associates
of
the
man
who
was
shot
along
with
each
of
these
men
separately,
both
of
them
wounded,
both
--
and
each
instance
they
--
they
had
no
attorney.
they
were
not
taken
before
the
magistrate
as
the
--
as
the
indiana
law
requires.
they
never
did
get
there.
they
didn't
see
a
lawyer
until
after
this
man
died
11
days.
they
were
held
locked
up.
they
were
taken
to
the
hospital
immediately
after
they
signed
a
confession,
immediately
after.
now,
the
evidence
shows
that
the
--
the
police
officers
said
in
interrogating
them
that
they
never
asked
for
a
lawyer.
that
they
never
complained
to
me
that
they
were
suffering
and
so
forth,
they
never
looked
at
a
wound.
that's
the
undisputed
evidence
here.
the
police
officers
never
examined
one
of
their
wounds.
they
know
they
were
shot.
they
knew
it.
they
knew
the
bullets
had
gone
clear
through
them.
they
said
they
couldn't
do
anything
about
it,
so
they
didn't
even
look
at
the
wounds.
they
stated
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
undisputed.
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
no,
i'm
talking
about
--
maybe
you
misunderstood
me.
i'm
talking
about
the
detectives
at
the
detective
bureau.
at
that
time,
while
they
had
him
they
did
--
they
don't
need
any
doctor
there,
until
he'd
signed
the
confession.
then
they
took
him
over
to
the
hospital
immediately
after.
now,
there
is
evidence,
your
honor,
that
at
the
state
police
headquarters,
a
doctor
had
looked
at
these
wounds.
that
doctor,
of
course,
didn't
testify
and
--
but
that's
--
that's
a
disputed
question,
we'll
throw
that
out.
but
the
--
the
--
the
man
in
charge
of
the
interrogation
did
not
look
at
the
wounds
to
see
how
severe
they
were.
they
said
they
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
anyway.
they
said
that
they
never
asked
for
an
attorney,
but
they
also
said
that
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
one,
if
he
had
asked
until
they
got
through
their
questioning.
meaning,
he'd
sign
his
confession.
they
said
his
parents
had
never
been
there
to
see
him
and
that
they
could
have
been
if
they'd
come
after
they
got
through
interrogating.
and
after
they
got
through
interrogating,
the
courts
as
when
they
signed
the
confession.
now,
all
that's
in
the
record
and
is
undisputed,
and
with
the
picture,
the
background
--
the
background
of
plainclothesman
interrogating
two
men
charged
for
shooting
one
of
their
fellow
plainclothesman
on
the
indianapolis
police
force.
and
with
these
men
in
the
physical
condition
they
were
admittedly
in,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
have
a
background
where
the
court
should
look
into
this
thing
and
weigh
some
of
this
evidence
as
it
has
done
in
other
cases
regardless
of
what
the
court
is
saying.
now,
one
of
the
things
here
in
this
case
which
--
and
--
and
one
of
the
things
which
points
to
the
danger
of
having
a
trial
18
years
afterwards,
as
this
was,
all
of
this
is
evidence
that
occurred
18
years
after
the
fact.
here
were
men,
75
years
old,
retired
from
the
police
force,
testifying
about
who
was
there
and
what
the
fellow
said
and
what
he
didn't
say
18
years
before.
now,
another
thing,
both
of
the
defendants
in
that
--
that
case
charged
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
confession
was
made
the
following
day
rather
than
the
day
that
the
police
said.
this
is
admitted
that
immediately
after
the
confession
was
signed,
they
were
taken
to
the
hospital,
the
city
hospital,
city
police
city
hospital,
they
were
taken
over
there.
but
when
this
case
came
for
trial,
the
record
of
that
hospital
showing
when
they
were
admitted
for
that
treatment,
it
would
seem
to
me
would
be
rather
conclusive
about
how
long
they'd
have
them
under
surveillance
and
how
long
they'd
have
them
under
questioning,
but
that
was
not
brought
out.
i
assume
it
was
because
the
long
lapse
of
time
had
meant
disappearance
and
destruction
of
the
hospital
record.
that's
just
one
of
the
things,
some
of
the
guns
were
missing,
no
ballistics
was
available
at
all
and
after
18
years,
i
don't
care
what
you
try
to
do,
you
can't
have
anything
that
bears
semblance
to
a
fair
trial.
it
isn't
a
trial
at
all,
it's
just
a
mockery.
and
that's
what
these
men
had.
mr.
william
s.
isham
frankly,
i
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
frankly,
i
don't
know.
i
did
not
prepare
the
petition.
i
had
a
thing
happened
in
my
family
i
--
i
didn't
prepare
it
myself
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
s.
isham
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
never
wrote
the
brief.
mr.
william
s.
isham
the
present
record
does
not
present
that
issue
as
--
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
although
i
did
feel
that
it
present
--
it
was
presented
in
the
indiana
supreme
court
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
--
by
virtue
of
their
other
two
opinions.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
--
well,
they
actually
--
actually
they
--
they
did
in
their
opinion
which
is
in
the
appendix
here.
they
--
they
decide
the
question
adversely
to
us
and
then
they
go
on
and
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
it,
before
them.
and
actually,
in
the
--
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
before
them,
was
just
a
murder
case,
tried
18
years
after
the
murder
was
committed
or
what
it
ever
it
was.
and
there
--
there
it
wouldn't
have
been
admissible
in
that
case,
of
course.
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
feel
that
that
is
the
most
important
thing.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that
is
right.
mr.
william
s.
isham
oh,
yes.
i'd
have
to
go
back
to
indiana.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that
--
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
isham
and
that
is
the
purpose
i
--
i
don't
want
to
correct
the
feel
that
--
that
i
have
any
positive
idea
that,
of
course,
that
these
men
were
tried
again
in
indiana
they'd
be
convicted.
i
don't
think
that
but
--
but
i
do
--
i
do
mean
that
when
you
attempt
to
evaluate
the
risk,
hear
--
hear,
a
man
--
hear
a
man
when
they
take
the
witness
stand.
they're
not
men
who
were
just
charged
with
crime,
they're
men
who
spent
18
years
in
the
federal
--
in
the
--
in
the
state
penitentiary,
which
is
enough
of
itself
to
put
a
blast
on
anything
they
might
say.
it's
anything
they
say
why
it's
--
it
would
have
no
credence
whatever.
and
your
records
lost
--
this
hospital
records.
now,
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
important
item
of
evidence
to
know
the
day
that
those
men
were
treated
in
the
hospital
because
that
was
the
day
the
confession
was
signed.
and
there
is,
or
was,
certainly
a
--
a
hospital
record
which
very
clearly
indicated
that,
but
it
wasn't
at
the
trial
and
it
probably
was
lost
along
with
things
that
get
lost
after
so
long
a
period
of
time.
it
just
stopped
and
think
back,
18
years
ago
today,
pearl
harbor,
1941.
what
the
--
what
does
--
what
does
one
remember
about
episodes
back
in
1941,
except
things
that
were
just
tremendously
outstanding?
and
--
and
that
is
the
--
that's
the
test
that
these
men
are
all
put
to
and
it
does
seem
to
me,
your
honors,
that
--
that
in
this
--
in
this
sort
of
settlement
where
the
evidence
is
coming
18
years
after
the
fact,
and
the
--
the
whole
picture
taking
into
consideration
that
we
know
how
policemen
treat
men
who
shoot
policemen.
well,
that's
the
crime
--
deal
of
crime.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
yes.
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
i
--
i
don't
believe
--
of
course,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
--
that
wasn't
in
the
record,
there
was
no
such
question
presented
in
the
record,
you
see.
mr.
william
s.
isham
and
i
don't
think
it's
incumbent
upon
a
person
who
has
been
the
victim
of
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
come
in
and
show
how
badly
he
got
hurt
and
the
presumption
is
he
didn't
get
hurt.
i
think
it
would
go
the
other
way.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
state
to
come
in
and
say,
"well,
even
if
we
were
(inaudible)
for
all
of
these
18
years,
still
he
didn't
get
hurt,
that's
virtually
what
was
done
of
the
cook
case.
and
in
the
cook
case,
if
the
--
if
they
had
been
able
to
give
him
a
--
an
appeal
18
years
afterward
of
his
original
conviction,
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed
it,
why
he
wasn't
hurt
because
they
would've
affirmed
it
one
year
after
his
conviction.
but
when
he
was
granted
a
new
trial
that
cast
a
whole
new
light
on
it
because
other
men
are
entitled
to
new
trials
within
less
than
18
years
after
the
crime
of
which
they're
charged.
and
that's
my
feeling
about
that.
mr.
william
s.
isham
that's
right.
mr.
william
s.
isham
confessions
were
invalid.
mr.
william
s.
isham
i
do,
your
honor.
and
that's
my
considered
opinion
about
it
and
i
--
i
realize
that
it's
a
--
i'm
sticking
my
neck
out
a
long
way.
but
i
--
i
believe
that
and
--
while
i
don't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
formerly
--
mr.
william
s.
isham
--
do
anything
that
might
embarrass
me
later,
i
think,
they
have
a
chance
to
get
out
and
they
won't
live
in
there
25
years.
mr.
william
s.
isham
well,
it
is
very
nice
to
have
the
court
say
that.
thank
you.
