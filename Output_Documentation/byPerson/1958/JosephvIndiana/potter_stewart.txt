justice
potter
stewart
mr.
isham,
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
this.
i
--
i
wasn't
here
when
this
petition
for
certiorari
is
considered
by
the
court.
did
you
in
the
petition
include
and
ask
the
court
to
consider
your
--
your
dowd
point,
the
point
that
these
men
were
prevented
from
taking
an
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
or
i
--
i
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
record,
this
--
this
present
record,
present
that
issue
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
indiana
supreme
court,
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
--
if
that
court
had
taken
judicial
notice
of
its
other
--
of
other
records
before.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
point
is
i
--
as
i
gathered,
i'm
dense
about
it,
but
that
--
that
is
--
is
the
most
important
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
if
you
were
right,
it
will
entitle
these
people
to
be
free
and
not
tried
again
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
order
to
present
that
issue,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
indiana
courts,
if
there
were
a
new
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
have
been
in
indiana
and
then
up
through
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
then
probably
a
writ
of
certiorari
here
before
you
could
begin
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
should
--
would
that
follow
or
i'd
say
it
been
denied
their
right
to
an
appeal
wouldn't
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
and
then
to
give
them
an
appeal
rather
than
a
new
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
so
there's
no
appeal,
then.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
so
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
happened
has
happened,
but
its
--
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
if
it
is
an
appeal
that
they
were
denied,
the
appropriate
thing
might've
been
for
indiana
to
review,
on
appeal,
the
propriety
of
--
of
their
first
trial
back
in
1934
or
1935.
justice
potter
stewart
however
it
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
really
refer
the
difference
between
killing
an
innocent,
isn't
it?
the
mere
fact
you
shoot
and
kill
somebody,
doesn't
mean
you're
guilty
of
any
crime
at
all
like
this.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
really
is
in
self-defense
that
--
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
--
did
the
other
man
testify,
joseph?
justice
potter
stewart
is
joseph
also
at
the
shooting?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
there.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
practice
(inaudible)
