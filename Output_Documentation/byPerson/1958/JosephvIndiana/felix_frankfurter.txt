what
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
counsel
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
capital
punishment
in
indiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
illegaly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
on
--
on
your
--
under
your
practice
in
a
criminal
case,
it's
stipulating
a
life
or
a
capital
case
to
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
filed
as
a
matter
of
course,
by
the
opinion
of
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
understand
that.
do
i
understand
that
the
review
by
the
supreme
court
is
automatic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
cases
where
there's
a
life
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
it
--
it
be
more
acted
in
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there's
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
indiana
and
it
is
denied,
then
the
right
of
appeal
is
mandatory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
criminal
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
misused
the
term,
"by
automatic,"
i
think
in
the
chief
justice's
state
from
the
capital
case.
there
is
an
automatic
review,
am
i
right
about
that
chief
justice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
in
indiana,
there
is
this
contingency
that
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
filed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
time
limit
--
without
time
limit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
1948,
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
and
the
question
that
isn't
here
what
you're
--
that
you're
that
you're
bringing
before
us
is
this,
that
if
a
state
improperly,
illegally
repeal
the
violation
of
the
constitution
unduly
alleges
doing
a
man
a
chance,
making
an
appeal,
but
it's
finally
granting
that
appeal
that
has
no
choice,
but
letting
them
go
clear
not
subjected
to
another
trial.
that's
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
that
is
not
here,
which
we're
trying
to
bring
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
raise
before
the
indiana
supreme
court
to
claim
that
you
should
go
--
that
your
client
should
go
free
and
not
to
have
a
new
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
deal
with
that
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
conscience
is
little
(inaudible)
by
this
non-raise
or
non-raisable
question.
in
that
the
argument
we
now
make
would
indicate
that
if
they
had
taken
their
--
if
they
--
if
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
had
been
granted
and
if
they
--
and
if
the
case
had
gone
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
had
a
new
trial,
they
would've
been
convicted
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
--
if
there
--
if
they
can
be
convicted
18
years
later,
they
can
certainly
can
be
convicted
one
year
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
has
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
now
saying
you're
dead
sure
he'd
be
convicted,
tomorrow
he
can.
that's
your
dilemma.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
he'd
be
convicted
if
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
because
you
reject
justice
brennan's
suggestion
that
your
clients
might
be
acquitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
on
the
merits,
that
the
supreme
court
put
on
the
record
and
make
the
determination,
but
you
can't
put
the
thing
from
the
usual
method
of
putting
in
fact
namely
a
jury,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

according
to
the
state's
version,
how
many
witnesses
--
i
take
that
they
were
all
in
the
state
police
or
indianapolis
state
--
state
police
or
indianapolis
police.
how
many,
in
number,
testified
that
these
so-called
confessions
were
of
voluntary
outpouring
(inaudible)
justice

they
--
they
all
testified
what

but
mr.
isham
called
thispollyanna
testimony.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
yes,
but
they
testified
they
were
cross-examined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
against
them
was
pierce's
testimony,
diametrically
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
before
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
is
the
practice
in
your
state
as
it
is
in
some
states,
but
then
the
matter
is
also
put
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
believe
it
or
not,
what
--
what
weight
you
give
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
any
--
the
court
instructed
them
that
the
testimony
--
that
the
confession
is
admissible
as
it
having
been
voluntarily
and
not
coerced,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
other
who
reached
these
witnesses
and
here
--
and
the
two
were

and
joseph
and
pierce,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix

any
--
joseph
against
the
police
officer.
justice
felix

and
the
judge
--
justice

--
who
believed

believed
the
police
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.o'mahoney,
may
i
raise
a
matter
that
is
not
an
issue
here
--
not
immediately
before
us
in
a
larger
aspect.
at
the
time
of
the
watts
case
which
--
of
which
you
know,
the
indiana
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
also
had
a
similar
situation
coming
up
from
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
haley
case,
as
you
know.
and
these
are
not
--
these
are
not
edifying
the
present
cases
if
one
would
deal
with
it.
take
the
watts
case
which
was
not
a
very
happy
record
to
face.
nevertheless,
one
had
to
face
this
one
dearly.
in
ohio,
as
a
result
of
the
haley
case,
i
don't
know
whether
generally,
that's
been,
in
ohio,
my
brother
stewart
would
know,
but
certainly
in
some
of
the
cities,
they
introduced
the
method
whereby
whenever
they
(inaudible)
confession
like
this,
a
so-called
confession,
i
say
so-called
(inaudible)
case,
you
always
have
some
disinterested
third
person
present
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
practice.
that's
been
introduced
in
the
haley
case.
now,
i
just
wonder
whether
--
whether
the
law
enforcing
agencies
of
indiana
thought
about
such
things.
it's
an
--
it's
--
it
seems
to
me
an
easy
thing,
it
takes
care
a
lot
of
this
authority
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
indiana?
it
is
practiced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
supervise
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
that
is
a
practice
is
some
of
your
counties,
isn't
it?
