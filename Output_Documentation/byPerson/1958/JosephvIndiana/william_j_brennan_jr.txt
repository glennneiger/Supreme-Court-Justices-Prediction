your
dilemma

your
dilemma

we
reversed,
is
that
it?
justice

wouldn't
they
be
convicted
without
these

j.
brennan,

(voice

justice

if
you're
surprised

they
are

if
they're
acquitted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

then

then
your

with
any
allegations

the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now,
one
last
question,
if
i
may.
then,
do
i
understand
after
the
new
trial
and
the
new
conviction
then
was
there
another
timely
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
was
denied

in
the
supreme

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
there
was
a
motion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
a
new
trial
under
your
practice
and
then
review
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
--
that
supreme
court
judgment
for
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
their
a
relationship
of
some
type
between
these
two
men
and
cook?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
not
involved
in
the
same
crime?
