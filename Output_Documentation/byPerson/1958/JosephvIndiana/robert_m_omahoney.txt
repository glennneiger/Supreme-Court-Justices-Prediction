mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
i
think
i
should
add
my
tribute
to
that
of
the
courts
to
mr.
isham's
appearance
here.
i
know
that
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding
he's
had
a
serious
personal
loss
in
his
family
and
yet
he
has
continued
his
perseverance
in
this
cause
and
i
think
that
the
sincerity
and
principles
are
beyond
question.
i
submit,
however,
that
the
essence
of
his
dilemma
in
his
action
really
is
that
the
question
before
this
court
has
already
been
resolved
against
him.
the
record
conclusively
resolves
it
against
him
and
the
fact
is
that
these
petitioners
were
not
denied
their
constitutional
rights
in
the
courts
of
the
--
of
the
state
of
indiana.
they
were
not
convicted
on
the
basis
of
coerced
confessions.
the
confessions
that
were
admitted
at
their
trial
in
hancock
county,
indiana
were
not
coerced.
now,
mr.
isham
made
most
of
his
argument
on
other
points
and
for
that
reason
i
shall,
as
soon
as
i
can,
devote
a
good
deal
of
time
to
those
points
since
i
think
the
court
is
interested
in
--
in
them,
but
i
think
first
of
all
that
we
should
discuss
the
question
which
the
court
has
before
it
which
is
the
admissibility
of
the
confessions
either
written
or
oral.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
now,
first
of
all,
there
are
three
points
or
four
points
rather
that
perhaps
we
didn't
bring
out
this
sufficient
clarity
in
our
brief
in
this
cause
and
i'd
like
to
point
those
out
and
the
first
one
is
important,
i
think,
particularly
because
the
emphasis
of
mr.
isham
put
on
the
situation
which
existed
in
1935
in
indiana
when
these
two
petitioners
where
apprehended
after
having
been
in
a
shooting
scrape
with
indianapolis
police
department
officers.
first
of
all,
the
officer
who
was
later
dead
was
not
dead
at
any
time
during
these
--
when
the
statements
were
taken.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
wasn't
possible
for
coercion
or
duress
have
been
used
on
them
because
the
police
officers
who
were
interrogating
them
were
fellow
officers
of
an
officer
who
had
been
wounded.
but
i
think
it's
important
because
there
was
not
a
reason
for
the
hysteria
that
a
death
of
a
fellow
officer
might
have
generated,
at
the
time.
well,
this
was
december
the
10th.
the
officer
was
very
much
alive.
and
in
fact
on
december
13th,
as
the
record
shows,
he
identified
these
petitioners
from
his
hospial
bed.
he
was
in
sufficiently
good
health
at
that
time.
now,
what
happened
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
he
died
8th
--
december
the
18th.
this
was
five
days
after
he
identified
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
the
petitioners
and
it
was
either
and
i
say
either,
it
was
either
six
days
or
it
was
eight
days
after
their
confessions.
now,
there
are
some
things
that
are
undisputed
in
this
record
and
there
are
other
things
that
are
disputed
and
i
take
issue
with
my
fellow
counsel
on
what
those
things
are.
so,
i'm
going
to
start
from
the
beginning.
these
two
individuals
escaped
from
michigan
city
penitentiary
together.
they
were
in
the
penitentiary
on
a
10-year
sentences
for
auto
banditry
and
they
are
approximately
had
served
half
of
their
sentences.
they
were
--
they
rented
an
apartment
in
indianapolis
and
on
december
the
7th,
two
indianapolis
police
officers
went
to
that
apartment,
knocked
on
the
door
and
gained
entrance.
now,
their
dispute
is
to
how
they
gained
entrance,
but
they
did
gain
entrance
and
there
was
a
gun
battle.
after
the
gun
battle,
in
which
all
four
participants
were
wounded,
these
petitioners
made
their
escape
by
running
out
of
a
backdoor,
down
a
stairway,
through
an
alley
and
intercepting
an
automobile
being
driven
by
a
doctor.
they
relieved
the
doctor
of
his
automobile
and
drove
with
his
car
which
included
his
medical
kit
to
a
town
near
rushville,
indiana,
approximately
50
miles
distant
from
the
city
of
indianapolis.
there,
they
remained
from
december
7th
until
early
on
the
morning
of
december
10th,
when
a
squad
of
state
police
officers
surrounded
the
house
and
succeeded
in
capturing
them
without
any
further
bloodshed
or
gun
battles.
they
were
taken
from
their
place
of
capture
to
the
rushville
state
police
post.
the
record
doesn't
say
how
long
they
remained
there.
they
went
from
there
to
the
state
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
this
is
december
10th,
early
in
the
morning,
1:30
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
two
days
and
about
a
half
as
they
were
there
the
afternoon
of
december
the
7th.
it
took
--
it
takes
about
an
hour,
i'd
say,
an
hour
and
a
half.
and
they
were
all
--
they're
all
of
the
8th
and
all
of
the
9th
until
the
morning
of
the
10th.
now,
they
were
taken
from
the
rushville
post
to
the
indianapolis
state
police
headquarters
which
at
that
time
were
located
in
the
basement
of
the
statehouse.
and
there,
according
to
the
state's
version
of
what
happened,
they
were
held
without
being
talked
to
by
any
police
officers
except
the
captain
who
was
in
charge
of
the
state
police
until
they
were
attended
by
the
state
police
physician,
dr.
byrd
(ph).
now,
their
version
is
they
weren't,
but
these
--
these
two
versions
are
directly
contradictory.
dr.
byrd
(ph)
treated
them
an
hour
according
to
state's
version
of
the
case
and
was
paid
by
them
out
of
money
they
had
on
their
person
when
they
were
captured.
about
8,
8:30
or
9
o'clock
that
morning,
they
were
turned
over
by
the
indiana
state
police
to
the
indianapolis
police
departmet
and
were
taken
then
to
indianapolis
police
headquarters.
now,
here
the
story
is
diverged
diametrically.
according
to
the
state's
version
of
the
events,
they
talked
freely
about
what
happened
at
all
times
when
they
came
from
the
rushville
post
to
the
state
police
headquarters.
there
are
statements
in
the
record.
there
is
testimony
that
they
admitted
the
crime
at
that
time.in
fact,
were
boastful
about
it,
proud
of
it.
there
are
statements
between
the
indianapolis
police
department
headquarters
and
the
indianapolis
state
police
headquarters.
according
to
the
state's
version
of
the
events,
within
a
matter
of
two
hours
or
less,
after
their
arrival
on
the
morning
of
december
10th
at
indianapolis
police
headquarters,
they
had
signed
their
confessions.
they
were
then
and
here
we
agree,
immediately
taken
to
the
city
hospital.
now,
mr.
isham
raises
a
question
and
i
think
it's
a
good
one
as
to
why
weren't
the
hospital
records
introduced
at
this
time
to
show
just
exactly
what
the
date
was.
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
wonder
very
long
about
that
reason.
the
reason
that
they
weren't
introduced
is
because
if
they
had
been
introduced,
they
would
not
have
confirmed
the
petitioner's
story.
more
than
that,
why
wasn't
the
testimony
of
say
the
attending
physician
at
the
city
hospital
introduced
by
the
petitioners
who
were
well
aware,
in
advance,
that
they
would
raise
this
issue
at
the
trial
and
who
did
raised
it
and
who
would
have
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
on
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
these
confessions
and
introduced
only
their
own
statements
at
that
hearing?
the
reason
that
they
didn't
introduce
it
appears
in
the
testimony
of
the
individual
concerned.
he
did
testify
as
a
witness
at
the
trial
and
he
did
testify
as
to
this
question.
now,
his
testimony
appears
at
page
192
or
193
of
the
printed
record.
and
i
think
it
pretty
well
shows
why
those
records
weren't
introduced.
and
apparently,
although
this
is
only
surmised,
they
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
this
is
the
testimony
of
dr.
(inaudible)
and
he
testified
that
he
was
the
superintendent
or
the
assistant
superintendent
of
the
city
hospital
when
these
men
were
brought
in
the
hospital.
he
further
testified
that
he
was
the
attending
physician
when
they
were
brought
in
the
hospital.
he
testified
that
they
were
brought
in
the
hospital
sometime
around
the
morning
of
december
10th
and
he
testified
further
and
i
think
this
is
extremely
important,
that
it
was
his
opinion
and
this
appears
at
the
middle
of
page
195.
that
the
physical
condition
of
these
two
men
--
now,
this
is
on
december
10th,
did
not
warrant
their
hospitalization.
they
were
examined
and
treated
as
outpatients
at
the
city
hospital.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that's
the
state's
version.
their
version
is
that
they
were
held
for
all
of
the
10th,
all
of
the
11th,
without
proper
medical
treatment
that
they
were
in
serious
condition,
that
they
were
held
in
cells
overnight
without
food
and
without
water.
that's
their
version.
there's
not
a
single
bit
of
evidence
in
the
whole
record
to
verify
any
statement
they
make
along
that
line.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
well,
the
hearing
on
the
confession
of
mr.
pierce,
which
was
the
first
one
held,
appears
at
page
56
of
the
printed
record
and
it
contained
as
well
as
the
testimony
of
pierce,
the
testimony
of
officers
mccarthy,
giles,
and
pope,
three
officers.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
they
all
testified
in
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
pollyanna,
if
you
will,
it
was
in
complete
opposition
to
what
the
petitioners
had
said.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
they
were.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
before
a
court
without
jury.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
and
after
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
while
the
court
ruled
that
the
confessions
were
admissible
and
admitted.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
no.
the
jury,
although
there
is
constitutional
provision
in
our
state
that
says
the
jury
determines
matters
of
fact
and
law,
the
practice
says
that
the
court
rules
on
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
now,
i
think
that
they
probably
might
have
been
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
the
point
of
this.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
whether
of
such
a
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
i
--
i
don't
know
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
they
instruct.
that's
not
in
the
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
on
the
first
hearing,
just
pierce,
now,
this
was
pierce's
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
and
later,
there
was
only
one
police
officer
who
testified
at
the
hearing
on
joseph's
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
in
that
particular
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
of
course
in
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
correct.
he
decides
it.
now,
there
is
something
else.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
the
new
trial
--
mr.
isham
correctly
stated
that
the
new
trial
was
granted
on
the
basis
that
these
men
had
been
denied
their
indiana
constitutional
right
to
an
appeal
and
they
were
given
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
no.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
well,
our
procedure
is
this.
that
if
you
want
to
prefect
--
perfect
an
appeal,
you
file
first
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
of
course,
if
you
get
the
new
trial,
you
gotten
all,
you've
gotten
by
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
and
here
we're
in
the
similar
position.
they
weren't
in
a
position
they
felt
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
we've
setout
the
petition
for
a
belated
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
against
--
for
from
which
an
adverse
ruling
on
which
you
may
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
and
this
is
the
procedure
that
has
developed.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
well,
i
think
they
were
faced
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
faced
with
several
difficulties,
among
them,
the
nonexistence
of
a
transcript.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
although
that
--
i
think
that
was
--
had
something
to
do
with
the
trial
court's
decision
that
would
be
necessary
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
to
grant
them
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
this
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
eliminating
the
need
for
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
now,
this
question
was
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
pardon?
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
now,
this
question
was
raised
in
their
petition
for
a
certiorari.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
yes,
except
this.
there
were
actually
two
new
trials.
in
the
second
subsequent
trial,
they
got
a
hung
jury.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
and
then
they
were
tried
--
a
third,
they
were
tried
in
november
of
1953
and
that
resulted
in
a
hung
jury
and
they
were
tried
again
in
february
1954
and
it
is
from
that,
that
we
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
arrived
here.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
this
petition
for
a
certiorari
has
been
granted.
now,
they
raised
this
issue
concerning
the
--
what
would
happen
to
them.
the
--
the
proposition
which,
i
think,
if
i
understand
mr.
isham
correctly,
is
what
he
would
like
to
contend
here
but
it's
for
--
gone
from
contending
because
of
the
ruling
of
the
court
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
they
raised
the
issue
of
this
denial
of
a
right
to
an
appeal.
because
mr.
isham
seems
to
feel
that
if
that
had
been
--
if
that
they
gone
up
through
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
they
might
somehow
rather
have
gotten
to
federal
court
and
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
having
then
exhausted
their
state
remedy.
and
mr.
isham,
i
submit,
is
entranced
with
that
system
because
it
worked
for
lawrence
cook,
who
was
a
good
friend
of
these
two
petitioners
and
has
helped
them
as
far
as
these
proceedings
are
concerned,
a
great
deal.
but,
i
submit
that
mr.
isham
misunderstands
what
this
court
did
in
the
cook
case
and
i
don't
think
--
he
doesn't
misunderstand
the
result,
but
he
understands
how
it
was
--
misunderstands
how
it
was
achieved.
this
was
raised
in
that
cook
case
and
i'll
--
i'll
read
just
a
--
a
moment
from
my
reply
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
originally
granted
or
made.
i
say
in
an
earlier
part
of
their
petition
under
the
heading
of
questions
presented
for
review,
petitioner
cites
dowd
versus
united
states
ex
rel.cook,
which
is
in
340
u.s.206.
and
i
say
that
petitioner
seemed
to
cite
the
cook
case
in
support
of
the
contention
that
unless
they
were
granted
an
appellate
review
of
their
original
conviction,
they
were
under
the
language
of
the
cook
case.
now
this
is
mr.
isham's
contention,
as
i
understand
it
here,
entitled
to
an
absolute
discharge.
this
is
not
the
holding
of
the
cook
case
and
i
submit
it
is
not.
the
last
paragraph
of
that
case
as
it's
decided
by
this
court
is
as
follows
and
i
quote
at
page
46
of
--
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
the
exact
page
of
that
citing.
but
anyway,
the
quotation
is
this,
“on
remand,
the
district
court
should
enter
such
orders
as
are
appropriate
to
allow
the
state,
a
reasonable
time,
in
which
to
afford
respondent
the
full
appellate
review
he
would
have
received,
but
for
the
suppression
of
his
papers,
failing
which
he
shall
be
discharged.”
what
happened
was
they
failed.
they
didn't
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
render
of
an
appellate
review.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
they
were
fellow
inmates
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
no,
not
in
the
same
crime.
but
that's
--
that
did
achieve
cook's
discharge
because
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
didn't
review
his
case
and
the
ultimate
result
of
it
in
compliance
with
the
court's
order
was
that
he
had
to
be
discharged,
but
had
they
reviewed
his
case,
the
only
thing
he
could
have
achieved
was
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
black,
why
they
didn't.
now,
i
want
to
say
something
else
in
regard
to
this
constitutional
issue
that
they've
raised
here
and
i
think
it's
very
important
and
it's
this.
paul
pierce
took
the
witness
stand
in
this
case.
now,
i
regret
we
haven't
got
that
in
the
printed
record,
but
we
--
through
our
own
inadvertence
didn't
do
it,
but
i
think
mr.
isham
will
conceive
this
is
true.
he
took
the
witness
stand
and
admitted
that
he
shot
orville
quinnette,
the
police
officer.
there
isn't
any
question,
whatever,
about
him
shooting
the
man.
and
we
do
have
in
his
printed
record
his
own
admission
in
the
statements
made
in
the
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
his
confession
that
he
did
shoot
orville
quinnette.
he
says
that
and
that
appears
in
here.
now,
the
difference
between
his
version
of
the
events
and
the
confession
to
which
these
people
object
and
which
they
say
was
coerced
is
the
slight
one
and
it's
only
this.
he
says
that
quinnette
came
in
the
door,
pulled
a
gun
and
started
shooting
and
that
he
shot
back.
it
would
seem
to
mean
self-defense.
now,
of
course,
admittedly
at
the
time
these
two
men
were
fugitives
from
justice
and
escaped
prisoners
from
indiana
state
prison
and
i
don't
think
his
version
of
the
story
was
believed.
but
he
admits
shooting
the
man.
there
isn't
any
question
about
him
shooting
the
man.
and
his
version
from
the
so-called
coerced
confession
is
a
slight
one,
a
very
slight
one.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
well,
when
taken
in
context
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
you
see
when
he
admitted
that
he
shot
quinnette
in
his
confession.
he
wasn't
admitting
he
killed
quinnette.
he
only
admitted
he
shot
him.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
a
defense
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
certainly,
a
complete
defense.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
that's
right.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
they
both
took
the
witness
stand.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
well,
joseph
didn't
actually
shoot
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
--
quinnette.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
there
is
some
dispute
about
whether
he
shot
anybody.
there
is
a
claim
that
he
shot
the
other
officer,
russell
chatham,
who
testified
in
that
at
all.
the
--
the
petitioners
believe
that
officer
chatham
shot
himself.
so
that's
--
it
hardly
matters.
i
want
to
say
just
one
other
thing
and
i
think
that
i'm
done
--
or
two
other
things.
there's
been
some
comment
here
that
leaves
inference
that
there
is
something
defective
in
the
post-conviction
remedies
in
the
state
of
indiana,
and
it
was
said
earlier
in
this
court
in
another
case,
the
earlier
case
which
was
here
last
week.
while
this
is
not
an
issue
here,
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
we
have
post-conviction
remedies
in
indiana
that
we
believe
are
adequate.
and
that
they're
available
to
these
petitioners
as
they
are
to
any
others
and
we
are
not
forced
to
adopt
the
due
process
clause.
we
have
a
due
process
clause
in
our
own
constitution,
which
we
enforce,
i
hope,
in
most
cases.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
the
--
the
haley
case?
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
it
is
to
my
knowledge
practiced
in
some
counties.
it
depends
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
in
--
in
some
counties,
it
depends
on
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
i
may
say
that
in
indiana,
prosecuting
attorneys
or
constitutional
officer
whereas
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
isn't
a
--
office
that
is
a
creature
of
statute.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
we
have
no
supervisory
power
over
our
prosecutors.
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
in
some
of
our
counties.
i
know
one
specific
instance
is
vigo
county.
i
don't
know
that
it's
practiced
in
marion
county
which
is
where
this
case
or
cause
originated
as
far
as
confessions
are
concerned.
now,
there's
one
other
thing.
the
comment
was
made
as
to
parole
and
what
possibilities
a
parole
are.
now,
i
can't
speak
for
the
parole
authority
of
the
state
of
indiana,
but
i
have
dealt
with
the
--
our
criminal
institutions
for
the
past
three
years.
and
it
is
true
that
it
is
a
policy
while
matters
are
pending
in
court,
that
they
do
not
parole
men.
now,
this
policy
is
a
sound
one.
i
think
if
you
contemplate
it.
and
it's
sound
for
this
reason,
if
a
man
files
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
of
the
northern
district
of
indiana
alleging
that
he's
being
held
unconstitutional
in
one
way,
the
end
of
the
proceeding
summarily
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
would
be
paroling.
then
whatever
the
question
was,
it
wouldn't
come
up.
we
don't
do
that.
if
he
wants
to
prosecute
a
writ
and
says
that
he's
being
held
unconstitutional,
let
him
prosecute
his
writ
and
settle
--
settle
the
issue
in
court.
after
the
matter
has
been
settled,
one
way
or
another,
then
the
parole
authorities
can
go
and
can
decide
whether
he's
a
good
parole
risk
under
the
circumstances.
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
i
--
mr.
robert
m.
o'mahoney
thank
you.
