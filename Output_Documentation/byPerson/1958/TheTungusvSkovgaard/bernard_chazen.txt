mr.
bernard
chazen
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
of
the
facts
in
the
case
and
then
proceed
to
the
legal
issues
which
i
think
the
court's
primarily
interested
in.
in
this
particular
case,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question,
but
that
the
petitioners'
officers
and
crew
were
on
board
all
during
this
period
and
that
they
participated
in
the
operations
which
were
involved
in
getting
the
pump
on
board.
they
conducted
inspections,
they
discovered
the
leak,
they
called
the
mr.
sexton
who
was
the
employee
of
el
dorado
on
board,
when
the
condition
existed
and
shortly
exercised
control
of
everything
that
went
on,
on
their
vessel.
so
that,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
issue
in
this
case
on
the
undisputed
fact,
but
that
the
--
they
remained
in
full
control
of
every
part
of
their
vessel
during
this
entire
time.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
this
was
not
a
dead
vessel
and
they
actually
maintained
housekeeping
functions.
they
actually
were
running
their
ship
at
that
time
and
one
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
she
was
tied
up
to
discharge
oil,
which
is
a
form
of
cargo.
yes.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
and
i
might
mention
it
here
so
that
i
won't
take
it
up
in
my
argument.
in
this
case,
skovgaard
was
as
analogous
to
hawn
as
any
individual
could
be
short
to
being
strained
on
the
facts.
because
if
you
recall
in
the
hawn
case,
hawn
was
--
ships
carpenter
or
a
carpenter
repairmen
who
was
called
on
board
to
adjust
some
grain
fittings
that
were
used
in
connection
with
unloading
or
loading
some
grain.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
here
is
oil
that's
being
unloaded
and
they
called
him
on
board
to
get
the
pump
started
again
so
that
they
can
discharge
the
oil
from
the
vessel.so
this
is
a
completely
analogous
situation
for
the
hawn
case.
now,
in
this
state
of
facts,
the
--
there's
no
question,
but
that
the
ship's
officers
knew
of
the
condition
of
the
deck
at
least
an
hour
before
this
accident
happened.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
--
it
was
their
factual
contention
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
tell
the
--
the
el
dorado
foreman,
skovgaard,
that
he
should
clean
up
the
mess.
that
that,
it
was
--
their
only
responsibility.
but
they
admit
it,
appears
in
the
log,
it
appears
in
the
testimony.
they
admit
that
they
knew
of
this
condition,
they
admit
that
it
was
a
dangerous
condition.
they
suggested
that
sawdust
and
sand
be
put
over
this
oil
in
order
to
prevent
the
hazard
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
the
accident
happened,
the
testimony
is
that
when
the
el
dorado
crew
returned,
there
was
sawdust
put
on
the
deck
and
the
inferences,
it
was
done
by
the
crew
and
that
the
crew
was
actually
putting
up
some
lines
around
the
open
tank.
the
deceased's
injury
in
this
case
did
not
stem
from
a
condition
he
was
called
upon
to
correct.
now,
we
mentioned
that
fact
because
that
was
the
point
at
which
the
trial
judge
stopped.
the
trial
judge
did
not
make
findings
of
facts
relative
to
negligence,
relative
to
unseaworthiness,
relative
to
comparative
or
contributory
negligence.
all
he
said
in
the
case
was
that
he
felt
it
was
not
the
duty,
and
that's
the
legal
duty,
of
the
vessel
to
clean
up
this
acknowledged
dangerous
condition
and
he
relied
upon
the
broecker
case
in
new
jersey
which
i
will
discuss
shortly.
judge
modarelli
said,
“here,
skovgaard
boarded
the
vessel
to
help
repair
the
defect
and
restore
to
operation
the
pump
which
caused
the
oil
spill,"
and
that's
the
only
that
could
be
considered
a
finding
of
fact.
he
does
not
say
that
he
was
called
on
board
to
clean
up
this
condition,
to
remove
the
oil
on
the
deck,
or
to
take
any
safety
measures
with
reference
to
this
oil.
he
was
called
from
his
home
after
two
other
men
had
tried
to
get
the
pump
to
operate
and
acouldn't
for
the
specific
purpose
of
getting
the
pump
back
in
operation.
i
also
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
testimony
that
the
two
men
who
had
been
working
on
the
pump
had
partially
squeegee
using
some
kind
of
a
device,
some
of
the
oil
from
the
deck.
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
unmistakably,
since
there's
some
mention
of
it
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
the
deceased
here
is
entitled
to
a
presumption
that
he
exercised
due
care
and
certainly,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
--
when
he
came
on
the
scene,
two
men
were
working
in
the
area,
it's
not
unreasonable
to
say
that
he,
as
a
matter
of
law,
assumed
the
risk
of
--
of
the
dangerous
condition
that
would
have
been
created
by
the
oil
spill
on
the
deck.
now
those,
i
think
are
the
important
facts.
the
other
important
fact
is,
of
course,
that
the
man
fell
into
the
tank
of
hot
oil
and
as
a
result
of
it,
died
leaving
a
widow
and
children.
now,
our
contentions
in
this
case
are,
first,
that
the
deceased,
if
he
had
lived,
would
have
been
entitled
under
the
general
maritime
law
to
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence,
to
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness,
and
that
the
rule
of
comparative
negligence
would
have
been
applied
to
him.
and
we
have
already
adverted
to
the
fact
that
he
was
analogous
to
hawn
so
i
won't
develop
that
point
any
further.
on
the
next
point,
our
contention
is,
that
the
general
maritime
law
both
as
to
unseaworthiness
and
negligence
and
as
to
the
defenses
to
be
applied
is
the
law
to
be
applied
in
this
case
and
we
arrived
at
this
result
on
two
--
through
two
routes.
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
one
route
first.
the
first
route
is
by
an
interpretation
of
the
new
jersey
act
itself.
now,
we
all
recognize
the
historical
situation
that
has
arisen
in
the
case
of
wrongful
death.
it's
caused
a
great
deal
of
trouble
both
in
common
law
jurisdictions
and
an
admiralty
jurisdictions.
for
some
reason,
the
common
law
was
unable
to
visualize
a
cause
of
action
in
terms
of
the
laws
of
next
of
kin.
in
other
words,
that
common
law,
the
common
law
was
unable
to
recognize
that
the
next
of
kin,
a
wife
and
children,
suffer
damage
from
a
negligent
tort
committed,
say
to
a
husband.and
so,
the
common
law
failed
to
provide
a
remedy.
this
was
the
reason
that
lord
campbell's
act
came
into
existence.
for
some
reason,
this
doctrine
had
sinked
over
into
maritime
law
and
we
have
the
statement
that
has
been
quoted
and
that
appears
that
maritime
law
as
such
does
not,
from
its
own
sources,
provide
a
remedy
for
wrongful
death.
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
thing
that
has
caused
the
--
the
court's
great
trouble
in
fashioning
a
common
law
rule
as
--
as
the
courts
or
--
or
a
maritime
law
rule
as
the
courts
have
done
in
--
with
respect
to
business
and
by
piece
and
other
types
of
liability
that
have
developed
through
the
years
has
been
that,
there
seems
to
be
no
model
for
determining
who
shall
take,
who
has
this
right
and
how
much
they
shouldn't
get
--
shall
get.
and
as
judge
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
the
various
states
have
enacted
these
wrongful
death
statutes
and
there
is
some
variation
as
to
who
may
recover
and
how
much
and
so
forth.
now,
the
new
jersey
statute
is
modeled
after
lord
campbell's
act
which
is
the
english
statute.
and
we
must
start
out
by
looking
at
the
new
jersey
statute
and
the
interpretation
of
the
new
jersey
statute
by
the
new
jersey
courts.that's
our
starting
point
on
our
first
leg.
and
this
is
the
case
--
on
--
on
this
approach,
i
can
distinguish
every
other
case
and
every
other
jurisdiction
because
i
can
say
to
your
honors,
i
don't
know
how
the
courts
have
interpreted
their
statutes
in
tennessee
or
in
florida
or
in
ohio,
each
state
would
have
to
be
--
each
statute
would
have
to
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
its
own
state
court
decisions.
i
can
only
discuss
the
interpretation
in
new
jersey.
now,
it's
clear
under
the
new
jersey
decisions
that
the
courts
in
new
jersey
regard
the
action
as
to
liability
as
derivative,
as
to
liability.
it's
a
new
cause
of
action
in
the
sense
that
it
creates
a
right
for
somebody
who
didn't
have
it
before.
but
--
and
--
and
one
case
i
think
it's
a
good
example
of
it.
there's
one
case
in
new
jersey
where
there,
the
court
applied
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
which
does
not
appear
in
the
wrongful
death
act.
the
wrongful
death
act
says,
"you
must
start
an
action
within
two
years,
if
you
don't,
you
automatic
--
two
years
from
the
date
of
death.
if
you
don't,
you
automatically
loose
your
right
to
a
cause
of
action."
in
addition,
there's
a
general
statute
which
requires
that
suits
be
instituted
for
personal
injury
within
two
years.
now,
on
this
particular
case,
the
deceased
had
been
injured
and
had
lived
for
more
than
two
years
and
had
not
instituted
the
action.
then
the
party
came
along,
the
next
of
kin
came
along
and
they
attempted
to
institute
suit
on
the
wrongful
death
act
and
the
state
personal
injury.
the
two-year
claim
was
pleaded
as
a
defense
on
the
ground
that
at
the
time
that
the
deceased
died,
he
no
longer
had
a
cause
of
action.
and
the
court
said,
"that's
right.
you
can
only
sue
if
the
deceased
had
a
cause
of
action
at
the
time
he
died."
he
lost
it.
because
at
the
time
he
died,
the
two-year
statute,
the
general
two-year
statute
had
applied.
now,
i
quoted
several
of
these
decisions
in
my
brief
and
i
won't
avert
to
all
of
them.
as
far
back
as
1896,
chief
justice
beasley
said,
first
--
the
first
question
is,
could
the
deceased,
if
he
had
survived,
have
maintained
the
action?
that's
the
first
question
under
the
new
jersey
act.
and
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
at
least,
since
the
case
of
hawn
versus
pope
&
talbot,
the
test
of
whether
the
deceased
could
have
maintained
his
action
is
the
general
maritime
law.
so
that
the
new
jersey
act,
by
this
reference
language,
refers
to
new
jersey
law.
and
this
is
reasonable,
this
is
sensible.
we
do
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
landlord
and
tenancy.
this
act
was
not
designed
to
specifically
lay
down
each
and
every
ground
of
liability.
this
was
simply
designed
to
cure
a
defect,
namely,
to
--
to
say,
"who
shall
receive
money,
who
shall
have
a
right
and
how
much
they
shall
receive?"
but
in
all
other
respects,
i
submit,
that
the
new
jersey
statute,
in
terms
of
liability
is
coextensive
with
the
liability
rights
of
the
deceased
if
he
had
lived.
in
addition
to
that,
the
new
jersey
courts
have
said
again
and
again,
the
new
jersey
statute
is
in
the
highest
sense
remedial.
it's
intended
to
correct
the
defect
in
the
law.it
should
be
liberally
and
broadly
construed.
it
shouldn't
be
narrowly
construed.
and
i
quoted
from
cases
on
that.
now,
as
judge
--
judge
hand
said
in
the
halecki
case,
it
would
be
incongruous
to
say
that
the
new
jersey
legislature
would
intend
to
give
the
widow
less
rights
and
liability
than
the
deceased
would
have
had.
in
other
words,
if
you
sue
on
the
survival
or
if
the
deceased
have
lived,
the
rule
of
comparative
negligence,
for
example,
would
apply
to
the
fullest.
but
if
he
dies,
we're
going
to
make
a
construction
of
this
statute
and
say,
“well,
we're
going
to
be
harder
on
you
than
the
general
maritime
law
even
though
you
weren't
at
fault.
we're
going
to
say
that
you're
going
to
have
to
apply
the
contributory
negligence
rule.
"i
say
that
the
only
fair
construction
of
the
new
jersey
statute
is
that
it's
a
referral
statute
and
that
it
incorporates
the
general
maritime
law.
and
for
this
reason,
if
this
action
was
--
were
started
in
the
state
court
on
this
analysis,
the
state
court
would
say,
“we
will
have
to
look
to
the
rights
of
the
deceased
if
he
had
lived
and
we
would
apply
the
general
maritime
law.”
now,
the
second
question
that
comes
up
under
the
interpretation
of
this
act
is
whether
the
words
"wrongful
act,
neglect
or
default"
includes
an
action
for
seaworthiness.
that's
already
been
passed
on.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it.
mr.
justice
brennan,
who
iss
sitting
in
this
court,
wrote
an
opinion
in
the
jensen
case
indicating
that
the
phrases
could
be
broadly
construed.
i
also
note
that
judge
lumbard
who
dissented
in
the
halecki
case
had
this
question
come
up
very
recently
in
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case
in
interpreting
the
new
jersey
statute
of
limitations.
the
new
jersey
statute
of
limitations
uses
the
phrase
“wrongful,
neglect
or
default”.
and
the
new
jersey
courts
have
generally
construed
that
any
personal
injury
case
where
the
rising
out
of
contract
or
tort
--
in
other
words,
including
breach
of
warranty
or
--
would
be
governed
or
would
--
be
governed
by
this
particular
phrase
“wrongful
act,
neglect,
or
default”.
and
as
a
result
of
that
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
it
was
construed
that
an
action
based
on
unseaworthiness
was
barred
by
analogy
under
the
new
jersey
statute
of
limitations
because
of
the
broad
scope
of
this
phrase.
and
of
course,
judge
lumbard
cited
and
referred
to
the
halecki
and
skovgaard
decisions
which
are
the
two
prior
cases
on
this
point.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
that
was
cited
in
my
brief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
day
i
was
reading
proof
in
the
halecki,
i
got
the
copy
from
the
printer.
and
it
came
out
just
at
the
same
time.
i
have
also
cited
judge
walsh's
opinion
which
was
affirmed
which
was
the
district
court
opinion
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
page
23,
your
honor.
now,
aside
from
the
interpretation
in
the
new
jersey
law,
i
have
cited
cases,
we
have
cited
cases
in
the
brief
showing
that
certainly,
new
york
state
in
the
greco
case
has
--
has
extended
this
language
of
wrongful
act,
neglect
and
default
to
include
an
action
for
breach
of
warranty.
and
some
of
the
language,
particularly
the
quotation
from
justice
cardozo,
i
think,
is
very
appropriate,
in
which
he
says
that
the
purpose
and
the
policy
of
the
courts
is
to
--
is
give
life
to
these
statutes,
not
to
kill
them
by
strict
construction.
and
that
these
statutes
themselves
are
source
of
new
law.
and
i
think
that
answers
part
of
the
argument
that
--
how
could
a
new
jersey
legislature
back
in
18
something
have
visualized
unseaworthiness
coming
under
this
particular
statute.
i
say
the
new
jersey
legislature
didn't
have
to
visualize
because
it
doesn't
enumerate
what
the
grounds
are
for
recovery.
it
--
it
deliberately
takes
a
referral
position.
it
--
it
goes
to
the
rights
under
such
as
if
the
deceased
had
lived.
and
because
of
that,
i
think
that
any
fair
construction
of
that
statute
comes
to
this
result.
now,
in
the
--
on
the
issue
of
contributory
negligence,
there
is
another
tact
which
i
would
like
to
raise
and
bring
for
the
court's
attention.
let
us
assume
that
the
new
jersey
statute
specifically
say,
"contributory
negligence
shall
be
barred
to
this
action."
now,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
it
does
not
so
state
and
i
--
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
only
reason
contributory
negligence
is
a
bar
in
new
jersey
is
because
it
is
a
bar
to
the
--
to
the
deceased
if
he
had
lived.
now,
let's
assume
we
come
to
new
jersey
or
perhaps
another
state
where
there
is
this
positive
rule
in
the
statute.
there's
no
question
about
it
that
the
intent
is
to
cover
everything
including
martime
cases.
in
that
situation,
i
think
we
come
back
to
fundamentals
which
were
adverted
before.
the
maritime
law
has
a
void
here
which
it's
supplying
by
adopting
the
state
wrongful
death
act.
the
maritime
law
as
i
understand
it,
grows
in
two
ways.
it's
--
it's
analogous
to
the
common
law.
one
is
by
assimilation
of
common
law
doctrines.
i
think
the
business
invitee
doctrine
is
coming
to
maritime
law
by
assimilation
from
common
for
example.
the
other
is
when
you
get
a
situation
like
this
where
the
maritime
law
hasn't
a
provision
where
it
has
a
kind
of
a
vacuum.
it
will
permit
the
state
law
to
come
in
and
for
the
specific
type
of
cases,
and
which
cases
which
occurred
in
new
jersey
will
adopt
that
statute
and
say,
“it
applies
here.”
now,
in
the
maritime
law,
there
is
a
strong
positive
rule
against
contributory
negligence,
or
to
put
in
another
way,
there's
a
strong
positive
rule
of
comparative
negligence.
this
is
an
affirmative
doctrine
of
maritime
law
and
one
that
i
think
maritime
law
is
justly
proud
of.
and
again,
in
the
hawn
case,
there
is
strong
language
indicating
that
fact.
and
i
think
they
refer
to
the
contributory
negligence
rule
as
being
a
discredited
rule
if
i
recall
correctly.
now,
when
the
new
jersey
act
comes
up
assuming
it
did
have
the
specific
provision,
i
think
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
maritime
law
can
say,
“we
have
a
strong
positive
rule
which
we
consider
superior
to
the
state
rule.”
and
since
this
is
being
adopted
into
the
fabric
of
maritime
law
where
we
have
a
strong
positive
rule,
we
will
not
adopt
the
state
rule,
we
will
insist
that
our
own
rule
be
followed
for
the
purpose
of
uniformity.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
feel
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
--
i
had
to
stick
pretty
close
to
--
to
the
book.
but
i
think
in
this
court,
this
court
is
concerned
with
the
overall
picture
and
the
whole
field
of
maritime
law
today
is
--
is
being
in
turmoil,
it's
--
it's
developing
very
quickly
and
i
think
that
the
court
wants
to
consider
or
should
consider
this
further
approach.
it
--
i
say
it's
not
necessary
to
--
to
affirm
my
case.
mr.
bernard
chazen
and
i
think
i
do
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
does,
it
will
help
to
--
to
make
a
little
more
uniform
this
problem.
and
unless
the
court
is
ready
to
fashion
its
own
rule
of
--
on
wrongful
death
cases,
this
is
at
least
the
step
in
that
direction.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
basically,
that's
the
bedrock
of
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
chazen
well,
i
--
i
say
that
we
now
have
two
courts
of
appeals
who
have
test
upon
this
question
and
have
specifically
held
that
the
general
standard
of
maritime
law
would
apply.
and
they
have
held
that
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
action.
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
didn't
come
out
flatly
and
say
that
comparative
negligence
would
apply
in
the
skovgaard
case.as
i
recall
the
opinion,
they
simply
said
the
case
should
be
sent
back
for
further
factual
determinations
as
to
what
defenses,
if
any,
are
available.
mr.
bernard
chazen
it
has
not
been
tried
on
the
merits
knowing
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
factually,
the
case
--
the
case
will
have
to
be
decided
factually,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes.
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
case
goes
back
for
retrial
and
we
haven't
come
here.
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
bound
by
the
halecki
decision
with
judge
learned
hand.
mr.
bernard
chazen
it
--
it
has
been
tried
on
the
merits.
please
forgive
me.
it
has
been
tried
on
the
merits.
there
was
a
determination
by
judge
modarelli
but
judge
modarelli
went
off
on
the
point
that
first
he
said,
is
--
he
--
he
recited
the
general
rule,
there's
no
recovery
for
wrongful
death
for
unseaworthiness
in
maritime
law
and
he
stopped
right
there.
mr.
bernard
chazen
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
chazen
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
hope
in
that
respect
that
this
court
would
answer
that
question.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
it
decides
the
halecki
case,
the
question
will
be
answered.
mr.
bernard
chazen
and
if
i
recall
correctly,
they
also
said
that
the
standard
of
the
maritime
law
even
if
the
negligence
would
apply.
i
--
i'm
not
sure
now
but
that
was
the
impression
i
got
from
reading
that
opinion.
now,
that
would
apply
as
a
matter
of
interpretation.
i
think
both
--
both
learned
--
judge
learned
hand
in
halecki
and
judge
sterling
in
skovgaard
took
the
approach
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
new
jersey
wrongful
death
act
--
mr.
bernard
chazen
--
feeling
that
on
that,
we
certainly
were
on
firm
ground.
now,
the
only
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
mention
before
i
close
and
i
think
perhaps
i
should
at
this
point
is
that
the
bruszewski
case
which
is
the
admiralty
case
following
the
broecker
case
which
is
the
new
jersey
case
relied
on
by
judge
modarelli
is
a
very
narrow
type
of
holding.
and
the
broecker
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
a
man
is
called
to
repair
a
hole
in
the
floor,
he
can't
complain
that
a
place
where
the
hole
in
the
floor
is
an
unsafe
place
to
work.
that
was
the
broecker
decision.
the
bruszewski
case
was
a
case
that
came
out
of
the
third
circuit.
and
in
that
case,
a
man
was
working,
fixing
a
broken
boom
and
among
other
things,
the
court
held
that
he
couldn't
complain
that
where
he
was
called
for
the
purpose
of
repairing
a
broken
boom
that
that
made
the
vessel
unseaworthiness
--
unseaworthy.
and
the
distinction
has
been
followed
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
think
judge
wright
wrote
a
--
a
very
clear
opinion
on
it.
in
that
case,
which
mr.
baker
has
adverted
to,
the
man
was
called
on
board
to
repair
a
broken
--
a
rusted
pipe.
and
in
order
to
do
so,
he
--
which
was
in
a
confined
place,
they
rigged
up
some
kind
of
very
clumsy
scaffolding.
and
while
he
was
doing
that,
the
rusty
pipe,
i
believe,
gave
way
and
he
fell
off
the
scaffolding
and
was
injured.
and
the
judge's
opinion
said,
the
rusty
pipe
does
not
--
is
not
an
unseaworthy
condition,
he
was
called
to
repair
this
thing.
but
the
scaffolding
was
an
unsafe
place
to
work
and
it
rendered
the
vessel
unseaworthy
and
gave
him
recovery
on
that
ground.
judge
goodrich
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
we've
cited
all
these
in
our
brief,
has
pointed
out
this
distinction
and
has
said
that
the
bruszewski
case
is
one
that
is
very
narrow
and
is
to
be
strictly
confined
to
that
type
of
case.
i
might
even
add
on
the
new
jersey
in
the
berquist
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
judge
goldman
indicated
that
the
broecker
case
also
is
a
case
that
is
to
be
interpreted
strictly
in
terms
of
the
precise
point
it's
raised.
now,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question,
not
in
the
judge's
opinion,
not
in
the
facts
that
are
in
the
record,
that
it
was
not
the
duty
of
mr.
skovgaard
to
clean
up
the
oil
on
the
deck.
he
was
called
from
home
for
the
specific
purpose
of
getting
the
pump
back
in
operating
order.
