mr.
j.
ward
o'neill
thank
you.
mr.
j.
ward
o'neill
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
just
to
outline
a
fact
for
this
case
of
death,
this
action
was
originally
started
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
but
they're
unable
to
get
--
we're
unable
to
join.
the
employer
of
this
man
is
a
third
party
in
new
york
so
we
had
the
case
removed
to
new
jersey
where
it
was
eventually
tried.
the
facts
giving
rise
to
the
action
are
these.
the
tungus
is
a
dry
cargo
vessel,
but
in
number
three
hatch,
she
has
two
deep
tanks
which
are
used
apparently
for
carrying
of
oil
or
for
dry
cargo.
to
that
in
the
philippine
islands
and
while
there,
a
cargo
of
coconut
oil
was
gotten.
and
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
trade,
it
was
carrying
under
what's
known
as
a
coconut
oil
contract.
now,
that
contract
among
other
things
contain
these
provisions.
the
shipper
of
the
oil
was
to
load
the
cargo,
supervised
the
cargo,
and
pay
for
the
loading
of
the
cargo.
by
the
same
token,
the
consignee
in
this
country
had
the
same
obligation,
namely,
to
supervise
the
unloading
of
the
cargo.
now,
when
the
vessel
came
to
new
york
--
i
might
say
too
that
that
contract
was
incorporated
in
the
bill
of
lading
so
that
became
part
of
the
contract
of
carriage.
when
the
vessel
arrived
in
new
york,
she
discharged
general
cargo
in
brooklyn.
and
while
there,
she
received
order
to
proceed
to
the
el
dorado
oil
plant
in
bayonne,
new
jersey.
she
arrived
there
about
5
o'clock.
right
after
her
arrival,
the
el
dorado
people
who
had
received
this
contract
from
the
owners
of
the
oil
not
only
to
discharge
it
but
to
store
it,
have
made
arrangements
for
mr.
skovgaard,
the
decedent,
to
examine
and
prepare
an
electric
pump
for
the
discharge
of
this
oil.
under
his
guidance,
one
of
the
repairman
placed
this
oil
on
a
pallet
or
skid
and
took
it
down
for
the
string
piece
on
the
dock.
after
the
vessel's
arrival,
a
mr.
sexton,
an
el
dorado
supervisor,
came
aboard
the
vessel,
examined
the
oil,
took
samples,
and
not
being
satisfied
that
the
oil
was
pure,
ordered
the
discharge
to
commence.
now,
after
the
vessel
tied
up
the
crew
as
customary
after
5
o'clock
were
on
the
shore
with
the
exception
of
two
men
and
an
officer,
were
always
on
guard
on
the
vessel
to
watch
the
lines
on
tidal
waters.
el
dorado
didn't
have
anybody
to
run
the
winches
so
the
two
crewman
ran
the
winches.
before
doing
that,
they
went
down,
that
is
the
el
dorado
people,
went
down
in
this
tank.
it's
about
nine
feet
long
and
about
three
feet
wide.
and
they
took
the
lid
off
that
tank
and
turned
it
at
a
90-degree
angle
leaving
about
one-third
of
the
tank
open.
they
then
brought
on
the
electric
pump
and
placed
it
on
the
tank
lid
with
the
suction
part
towards
this
hole.
now,
every
part
of
this
pump,
the
hoses,
the
air
injection
lines,
every
part
of
it
belong
to
el
dorado.
they
supplied
electricity
from
the
shore
to
run
the
pump,
and
they
had
a
man
there
sets
just
where
he
wanted
the
pump
placed.
the
pump
was
placed
in
that
position
and
an
answer
to
interrogatory,
it
was
admitted
that
this
pump
was
such
and
it
required
a
man
alongside
the
pump
at
all
times.
about
9
o'clock
that
night,
the
officer
on
watch
checking
his
lines
and
walking
around
the
deck
looked
down
and
saw
that
the
pump
was
smoking.
not
knowing
anything
about
the
pump,
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
run
ashore,
which
he
did,
brought
an
el
dorado
man
on
board
who
fixed
the
pump.
pumping
continued
then
that
was
relieved
for
about
11
o'clock,
a
man
by
the
name
of
russell
(ph)
pump
man
who
came
aboard.
about
12:15,
just
after
midnight,
the
third
officer
was
taken
over.
they
watched,
looked
down
and
saw
that
this
pump
was
leaking.
and
then
they
say
at
this
point,
it
was
leaking
to
what
they
call
a
nipple.
and
that
simply
means
sort
of
an
attachment
on
the
pump
where
they
attached
an
air
hose
to
get
suction.
and
this
nipple
was
an
ethical
part
of
the
pump.
it
was
created
by
el
dorado
people
from
their
own
shop.
now,
again,
the
crew
was
in
a
situation.
and
not
knowing
anything
about
this
pump
not
even
knowing
how
to
turn
it
off.
again,
we
had
a
rundown
to
get
somebody
from
the
dock.
and
by
the
time
he
came
back,
there
were
several
tons
of
oils
went
into
--
between
the
deck.
well,
the
officer
came
out,
they
went
down,
they
found
that
this
oil
had
leaked
down
on
other
cargo.
and
that
resulted
in
an
argument
to
dismiss
the
suction
because
we
asked
them
to
admit
and
it
is
his
responsibility
and
he
refused
to
sign
any
papers
stating
that
the
(inaudible)
and
he
couldn't
see.
on
the
mean
time,
el
dorado
had
sent
two
people
down
to
repair
this
pump.
they
came
to
shore
with
the
loose
nipple,
they
sit
down
and
they
tried
to
get
suction,
they
couldn't
get
suction.
they
then
called
up
the
decedent
who
was
at
his
home,
told
him
of
what
happened
and
he
came
aboard
while
there
was
an
argument
going
on
on
the
deck
between
the
chief
officer
and
mr.
sexton.
the
chief
officer
offered
mr.
sexton
who
had
made
an
entry
in
the
log
to
that
effect.
that
you
can
sawdust
or
sand
if
you
wanted
to
put
on
this
oil.
mr.
sexton
said
that
conversation
wasn't
solved
but
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
in
complete
charge
of
this
oil,
he
looked
down
after
the
tank
he
intended
to
salvage
the
oil.
and
he
looked
into
the
tank
and
for
what
he
could
see,
his
men
who
were
down
there
repairing
the
pump
by
cleaning
the
sufficient
area.
so
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
sufficiently
clean
as
he
saw
it.
and
of
course,
the
oil
could
not
be
salvaged
if
it
were
contaminated
in
any
way
by
the
sand
or
anything
else
that
might
have
been
put
on
it.
and
mr.
skovgaard
came
aboard,
stood
up
on
the
deck,
looked
down
into
the
hall,
and
gave
orders
to
these
two
men
who
were
working
on
the
hatch.
he
walked
around
up
above
and
eventually
he
went
down
into
the
hatch.
he
stood
up,
went
into
the
--
the
pump,
walked
around
through
this
oil
it
was
spread
all
over
and
up
and
tried
to
step
on
the
tank
cover
and
in
so
doing
slipped
and
fell
to
his
death.
i
may
say
at
this
point
that
this
particular
pump,
the
ship
knew
nothing
about
it.
we
had
no
part
of
it.
we
knew
nothing
about
it
and
the
only
man
who
seems
to
know
anything
about
that
pump
was
a
mr.
blaney.
mr.
blaney
was
chief
superintendent.
he
came
aboard
immediately
after
the
accident
and
then
all
he
had
to
do
is
lower
the
pump
and
the
pump
worked
and
discharge
continued
the
next
morning.
now,
fortunately,
the
law
in
this
case
we
had
the
situation
of
having
all
the
witnesses
live
and
testify.
and
judge
modarelli
had
to
take
the
advantage
of
their
testimony
as
well
as
watching
them
verbally
testify
in
court.
and
on
all
the
evidence
he
held,
that
there
was
no
duty
here
on
the
part
of
the
ship
to
this
man
and
dismissed
--
dismissed
the
libel.
in
part,
he
relied
on
a
decision
of
the
new
jersey
court
that
is
the
workmen's
compensation
bureau,
who
went
through
this
hearings.
and
they
decided
that
this
man
was
entitled
to
his
compensation
under
the
new
jersey
act
because
he
was
in
the
twilight
zone
and
was
really
not
working
for
the
ship,
rather
was
working
for
the
people
at
shore.
now,
in
that
connection
i
might
say,
sir
that
we
have
two
causes
of
action
on
this
case
under
the
new
jersey
death
act
one
for
negligence
and
one
for
unseaworthiness,
and
two
causes
of
action
under
the
survival
statute.
i
submit
sir
at
the
very
time
that
this
libel
was
filed.
the
--
the
appellant
had
in
mind
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
recovering
except
under
the
survival
statute.
but
on
the
trial
as
i
explained
the
death
of
this
man,
there
was
nothing
left
under
the
survival
statute.
he
was
practically
dead
when
he
fell
into
the
tank.
the
effect
cause
has
been
abandoned
and
then
we
went
to
the
jersey
death
act.
now,
in
their
brief,
they
tried
to
give
the
impression
as
not
only
a
death
statute
--
statute,
it's
survival
statute.
and
i
submit
it
is
not
the
--
congress
didn't
intend
it
to
be
such
because
when
congress
passed,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
they
specifically
said
--
i
refer
to
page
17
of
my
main
brief,
"after
giving
a
cause
of
action,
a
death
of
a
person
shall
be
caused
by
wrongful
act,
neglect
or
default
occurring
on
the
high
seas
beyond
a
marine
league
from
shore."
now,
the
second
provision
was,
the
provisons
of
any
state
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
for
remedy
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
statute.
now,
the
statute
of
new
jersey
that
is
a
similar
statute,
the
statutes
of
new
jersey
has
never
been
interpreted
for
the
maritime
law.
but
in
similar
statutes,
they've
always
held
that
rather
it
was
a
limitng
statute.
in
other
words,
you
come
up
to
the
point
if
the
man
had
a
cause
of
action
himself.
but
that's
the
jersey
legislature
didn't
intend
that
that
be
a
survival
statute
or
to
give
any
more
than
the
jersey
law
gave.
they
then
filled
in
the
gap
by
giving
a
right
of
action
to
a
--
to
a
survivor.
that
is
that
that
cause
of
action
which
he
haven't
solved
for
pain
and
suffering,
medical
expenses
and
other
expenses
in
that
line.
i'd
also
submit,
sir,
there's
two
that
if
we
look
at
this
statute,
suppose
that
there
were
two
men,
left
the
el
dorado
plant.
two
men
went
down
because
the
holes
would
leak
where
the
oil
went
in
to
the
tank
on
shore
and
the
other
man
sent
aboard
the
ship.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
the
new
jersey
legislature
intended
in
1846
that
there'd
be
two
separate
causes
of
action
for
its
citizen,
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
the
fact
the
man
would
fall
into
the
tank,
he
would
only
have
--
have
his
rights
that
this
man
had
them
under
the
state
act,
he
would
have
recovered
his
compensation.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
this
other
man,
he
goes
on
the
ship
and
he
derives
his
right
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
a
seaman.
he
is
a
seaman.
but
if
he
were
a
true
seaman,
he
would
have
no
cause
of
action
in
this
case
for
unseaworthiness.
his
--
his
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness
would
die
with
his
death.
and
yet,
this
man
stands
in
his
shoes
and
his
right
claiming
under
the
law.
now,
mr.
baker
and
i
assumed
it
will
be
followed
up.
makes
more
to
the
fact
about
the
case
being
brought
in
admiralty.
but
i
think
cases
in
this
court
are
uniform
in
holding
that
admiralty,
and
i
cite
them
at
page
20
of
my
brief,
western
fuel
versus
garcia
and
just
versus
chambers.
in
one,
western
fuel
case
we
say,
"admiralty
courts
move
in
to
obtain
a
libel
in
personam
for
damages
sustained."
and
the
others
they
say,
they
won't
force
a
wrongful
death
act.
and
admiralty
does
no
more
and
provide
the
forum,
it
doesn't
provide
any
rights
under
the
admiralty
law.
it's
just
the
forum
that
admiralty
law
provides.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
courts
below,
we
might
say
it
was
agreed,
all
eight
judges
agreed
that
new
jersey's
death
statute
was
the
only
statute
involved
in
this
case.
and
under
that
statute,
of
course,
judge
modarelli
held
no
duty
with
respect
toward
conditions
growing
out
of
the
nature
of
the
work
that
the
man
was
doing
at
the
time.
maybe
i
should
save
a
few
minutes
or
--
mr.
j.
ward
o'neill
--
unless
you
want
--
want
--
mr.
j.
ward
o'neill
on
this
route,
i
may
say
this,
our
position
here
is
that
the
district
court
dismissed
this
libel
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
duty
owed
to
this
man
because
under
the
new
jersey
law
where
somebody
knows
what
the
premises
are
like
and
goes
in
as
mr.
skovgaard
did
unquestioned.
then
there's
no
liability
on
the
part
of
that
owner
to
warn
him.
now,
we
have
the
additional
fact
in
this
case
to
that
forgetting
about
mr.
sexton
refusing
to
correct
that,
and
as
fellow
employees
trying
to
correct
it.
we
have
the
additional
fact
that
at
the
end
of
this
loading,
these
men
were
going
down
into
that
tank,
go
down
this
ladder
that
had
been
submerged
in
the
oil
all
the
way
from
the
philippines
to
scrape
it
off
the
sides
and
get
it
--
and
wallow
in
it
to
get
near
the
--
the
muzzle
of
the
hose
so
they
could
get
it
out.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
this
man
fell,
they
did
go
down
in
that
tank.
now,
here,
the
crew
on
the
ship,
here,
they
had
men
aboard
whom
they
knew
at
some
stage
of
the
proceeding
were
going
down
after
this
oil.
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
lower
court
held
and
under
new
jersey
law,
there
was
no
obligation
to
warn
a
man
of
the
condition
that
was
perfectly
obvious.
now,
contributory
negligence
wasn't
in
this
case
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
was
tried
before
the
district
court
on
a
theory
of
negligence.
i
don't
see
where
unseaworthiness
came
into
this
case
of
the
reply
brief
in
the
circuit
courts,
tried
it
on
a
--
on
a
question
of
negligence.
now,
we
say,
sir,
there's
no
--
no
need
to
send
this
back
because
if
this
court
agrees
or
the
judges
below
thought
the
libel
should
be
dismissed
that
this
court
agrees
with
those
four
judges
on
that
point,
there
would
be
no
need
to
send
it
back
for
new
trial.
thank
you.
