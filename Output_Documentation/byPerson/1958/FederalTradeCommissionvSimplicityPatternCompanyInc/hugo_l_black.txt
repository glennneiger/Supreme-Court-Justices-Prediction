i
haven't
been

i'm
not
quite
clear
just
how
you
construe,
unless
justifications
shall
be
affirmed
and
to
be
made.
i
understand
you
to
say
that's
procedural,
but
what
kind
of
justifications
can
be
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
under
(a).
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
that
(a)
is
wholly
separate
and
distinct
from
(e)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
the
inference
you
had
drawn
from
the
part
of
your
argument.
suppose
your
agency
here
puts
up
a
filling
station
and
also
has
some

business
in

would
it
violate
this
act
or
to
give
it
more
services
or
less
services
than
it
did
in
filling
stations
and
competition
with
it
who
sold
nothing
but
gasoline?
justice

l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
sell
gas
--
each
one
of
them
sells
gasoline.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
won't
say
competition,
each
one
of
them
sells
gasoline.

well

she

money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
want
is
to
sell
their
fabrics.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
evidently
your
company
is
not
doing
its
pattern,
didn't
get
enough
other
salesman
after
your
pattern.
justice

l.

is
it
--
could
that
--
it
is
a
success
i've
just
asked
you
for
curiosity
(inaudible)
publishing

justice

their
competitors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
was
that
said
in?
what
kind
of
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said
sometimes
by
price
discrimination
--
justice
hugo

--
and
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
legislative
history
shows
that
as
one
of
the
things
aimed
at
so
far
as
an
alleged
practice
a
large
operator,
chain
store
operators
and
others
--
their
sale
to
put
in
--
give
them
purported
services
in
connection
with
their
sales
which
would
add
to
the
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
grown
about
that
period,
as
i
recall
it,
the
considerable
idea
that
that
was
a
common
practice
upholding
companies
and
general
companies
of
that
kind
to
render
purported
services
and
there
was
considerable
hostility
to
it,
as
--
as
i
recall,
in
connection
with
this
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
drug
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
justified
by
the
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
were
contending
that
there
should
be
a
proof
here
that
somehow,
although
it
might
serve
--
serve
to
injure
the
trader,
nevertheless,
the
government
must
go
further
or
you
must
show
or
in
some
of
the
issue
came
in
there
as
to
whether
injured
competition
enjoin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
legal
issue
to
the
definition
of
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
a
person,
it
may
be
selling
goods
across
the
street
the
same
kind
of
goods
as
a
man
--
another
merchant
across
the
street,
but
that
somehow,
under
some
circumstances
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
one
is
having
these
are
that
they
are
still
non-competition
with
one
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
most
of
it
--
i'm
--
i'm
asking
because
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
hadn't
understood
that
could
be
the
--
had
been
my
concept
of
competition.
i
--
i
didn't
know
that
you
--
had
to
somehow
show
that
both
of
them
are
anxious
to
deal
in
those
particular
goods
if
they
were
actually
dealing
the
same
kind
of
goods.
i
don't
always
suppose
that
they
were
competitors
that
they
were
in
the
same
area.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
might
as
not
be
in
competition
with
woolworth
on
dental
floss
although
it
was
not
in
competition
with
them
on
diamonds.
if
--
if
tiffany's
sales
that
dental
floss,
woolworth
service
that
much
less,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
most
likely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
recall
it
now,
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
is
actually
doing
that
business
at
a
loss.
as
i
recall
it,
one
of
the
chief
complaints
that
bought
about,
the
passage
of
these
laws
was
that
some
of
the
companies
were
selling
goods
at
a
loss
and
injuring
the
smaller
ones.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
every
time
--
every
time
they
sell
a
pattern
at
the
loss,
it
probably
not
every
time,
at
least
sometimes
it
takes
away
from
the
people
who
make
a
profit
out
of
it
their
chance
to
make
a
sale
to
that
person.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
quite
a
different
proposition.
that's
clear
whether
you
read
into
the
3
(b)
--
the
2
(b)
--
the
2
(c).
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
as
meant
there
by
competitive
injury?
i
mean
what
is
your
interpretation
of
it
supporting
your
claim.
