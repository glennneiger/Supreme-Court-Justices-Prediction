mr.
weston,
would
you
mind
stating
at
the
outset
briefly
as
you
--
as
your
time
permits,
what
the
answer
as
to
the
suggestion
that
2
(a)
puts
the
burden
on
the
commission
to
prove
justification
but
2
(b)
without
qualifying
justification
except
in
the
way
in
which
you
impliedly
qualified
makes
a
big
difference
in
putting
the
justification
on
the
--
on
the
person
in
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
part
of
it,
the
2
(a)?
justice

frankfurter
that
isn't
everybody's
understanding.
i
was
just
reading
the
dissenting
opinion,
with
great
impartiality,
i
read
the
dissenting
opinion,
automatic
canteen
that
it
was
the
court's
opinion
and
i
get
a
different
impression
from
a
very
annoying
writer
in
that
phrase.
justice

and
not
dependent
on

--
as

read
2
(a),
that's
what
it
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
will
you
agree
that
2
(a)
and
2
(b)
state
the
matter
of
differences
that
in
2
(a),
it's
part
of
2
(a)
and
2
(b)
it
--
it
state
the
differences?
will
you
agree
to
that,
as
a
matter
of
language
of
phrasing?
i'm
not
suggesting
that
robinson-patman
is
an
elegant
bit
of
draftsmanship.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
true
of
2
(b),
but
2
(a)
isn't
stated
in
those
term,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
by
the
language
if
i
read
it
without
having
the
exegesis
of
decisions
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
that's
what
i
mean
i'm
reading
it.

2
(a)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
what
2
(a)
says
the
proviso?
where
is
the
proviso?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
read
it.

read
it,
pieces
of
the
proviso.
justice
felix

but
before
you
get
to
the
proviso,
read

substantive
part
of

all
right.
very
well.
very
well.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
get
your
answer.
i'm
not
--
justice
felix

i'm
so
confused
that's
why
i'm
asking,
otherwise
i
won't
be
asking.

is
that
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
2
(a)
and
2
(b),
that's
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
justice
felix

--
they
deal
with
different
subject
matters.

that's

with
yourself
by

given
by

you
get

what

where
do
we
derive
to

advisory?
where
do
i
go
to
find
out
what
are
the
elements
for
a
justification?
justice

the
whole
--
the

are
they
spelled
out

do

draw
them

justice

suppose
there
were
no
provisos
in
2
(b),
would
--
what
is
now
the
proviso
be
included
in
the
authorizations
who
make
justification?
in

words,
is
the
proviso
redundant
or
explicatory?
which
is
it?
what
is
it?
