mr.
william
simon
in
the
one
minute
that
remains,
may
i
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question
to
mr.
weston
by
saying
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
commission
here
that
the
first
clause
of
2
(b)
is
meaningless
and
that
it
should
be
read
out
of
the
statute
and
they
can
see
in
their
brief,
mr.
justice
black
at
page
23
of
their
second
brief.
they
say,
“it
is
true
that
the
only
affirmative
defense
authorized
to
a
charge
of
discrimination
in
services
or
facilities
is
the
meeting
competition
defense
of
section
2
(b)'s
proviso
and
that
is
the
lower
half
of
the
proviso.
and
then,
they
continue
in
--
and
in
that
sense,
it
is
true
that
the
first
clause
of
section
2
(b)
adds
nothing
to
the
proviso
in
its
application
to
a
2
(e)
proceeding.
and
so,
it
is
their
flat
position
here.
they
say
it
adds
nothing
to
the
case,
in
effect,
they
would
wipe
the
first
clause
of
2
(b)
out
as
to
a
2
(e)
proceeding
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
congress
expressly
said
that
it
should
be
applicable
to
a
case
involving
discrimination
in
price
or
services
or
facilities,
so
the
use
of
the
words
services
or
facilities
in
the
first
clause
of
2
(e)
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
it
to
be
applicable
to
a
2
(e)
case
and
yet
they
conceded
is
meaningless.
mr.
william
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
case
of
fabric
shops,
patterns
are
but
a
means
to
the
end
and
the
end
is
the
sale
of
fabrics
which
are
the
business
of
the
fabric
shops.
fabric
shops
generally
have
a
substantial
area
of
their
place
of
business
devoted
to
the
sale
of
patterns.
as
the
hearing
examiner
found,
they
invite
the
women
to
come
in
and
sit
and
browse
through
the
pattern
catalogues
in
the
hope
that
when
they
find
a
pattern
that
suits
their
taste,
it
will
generate
a
fabric
sale,
but
fabrics
to
the
things
they
want
to
sell.
the
red
fronts
or
10-cent
stores
on
the
other
hand
sell
pattens
wholly
on
their
own.
the
evidence
is
they
won't
carry
patterns
unless
they
can
sell
them
at
a
profit.
and
they
devote
just
a
small
little
space
on
the
counter
big
enough
for
one
catalogue.
a
woman
stands
there
and
stumps
through
the
catalogue
until
she
finds
the
pattern
she
wants,
and
then
the
clerk
reaches
under
the
counter
and
hands
her
--
her
pattern.
and
when
a
woman
has
purchased
a
pattern
in
a
red
front
store,
there
is
just
one
thing
she
can
do
it,
and
that's
go
to
some
fabric
shop
and
buy
some
fabric
with
which
to
make
a
dress.
these
are
the
findings
of
the
hearing
examiner
which
were
later
adopted
by
the
commission,
and
i
quote
from
page
222
and
223
of
the
record,
“it
is
quite
true
that
stores
of
the
two
groups
approach
the
sale
of
patterns
from
widely
different
view
points
and
that
their
methods
of
selling
the
patterns
also
differs
substantially.
with
the
10-cent
stores,
patterns
are
handled
as
any
other
item
of
merchandise.”

i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
simon
22,
excuse
me,
sir.
the
--
about
the
10th
line
from
the
bottom,
“it
is
quite
true
--
mr.
william
simon
--
that
the
two
--
that
stores
in
the
two
groups
approached
the
sale
of
patterns
from
widely
different
view
points
that
their
methods
of
selling
the
patterns
also
differ
substantially.
with
the
10-cent

are
handled
as
any
other

that
is
patterns
must
stand
on
their
own
feet
and
show
a
profit,
otherwise
the
store
will
not
handle
them.
the
patterns
are
usually
kept
in
a
cabinet
under
the
counter
and
the
only
thing
the
perspective
customer
sees
is
the
catalogue
which
is
a
lot
of
small
space
on
the
counter.
no
use
is
made
of
respondent's
monthly
fashion
previews
or
any
other
advertising
material.
the
situation
is
quite
different
with
the
yardgood
store.
usually,
it
does
not
make
any
profit
on
patterns
nor
does
it
expect
to
do
so.
it
handles
patterns
to
promote
the
sale
of
fabrics
and
because
its
customers
expect
this
service.
the
patterns,
catalogue,
fashion
previous
and
other
advertising
material
are
prominently
displayed
and
the
customers
are
invited
to
sit
and
browse
through
the
material
all
in
order
to
create
fabric
sales.
the
record
evidence
is
that
something
like
90%
of
the
cost
of
making
a
garment
is
in
the
fabric.
now,
the
other
costs
include
the
buttons
and
the
accessories
and
a
minor
cost
for
the
pattern,
but
90%
of
it
is
the
cost
of
the
fabric.
three
of
the
commission's
six
fabric
store
witnesses
testified
they'd
like
to
have
a
red
front
on
either
side
of
them
selling
fabrics
because
that
would
generate
selling
patterns
--
excuse
me,
so
long
as
they
didn't
sell
fabrics
because
that
would
generate
fabric
sales
and
two
more
of
the
commission's
witnesses
said,
“we
don't
regard
woolworth
as
our
competitors
because
they
don't
sell
fabrics.”
and
one
of
those
men
said,
“when
she
buys
a
pattern
in
a
woolworth
store,
she
might
come
to
me
to
buy
for
fabrics.”
in
addition
to
the
things
that
we
do
for
the
red
fronts
and
mr.
west
from
this
morning
named
four
things
that
we
do
for
the
red
fronts,
the
catalogues,
the
cabinets,
the
transportation,
the
initial
inventory
and
there
are
other
things
that
were
charged
in
the
complaint
that
we
also
do
for
the
red
fronts.
but
significantly,
most
of
the
alleged
differential
treatment
was
charged
by
the
commission
as
a
violation
of
count
one
were
they
conceded
they
had
the
proving
through
the
competition.
and
in
their
brief
in
this
court
on
page
4
of
the
first
brief
and
page
9
of
the
second
brief,
they
expressly
say
that
75%
of
the
total
differentials
were
charged
under
count
one.
this
morning,
mr.
west
told
you
that
woolworth
has
a
$1,800,000
worth
of
inventory.
that
was
charged
under
count
one,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
75%
of
the
differentials
were
charged
under
count
one
including
the
major
items
he
mentioned
this
morning.
that
count
was
dismissed
because
of
the
affirmative
finding
of
knowing
through
the
competition.
and
this
record
shows
that
we
do
even
more
for
the
fabric
shops
than
we
do
for
the
red
fronts
although
they
are
different
items.

of

they
have
a
core
of
women
who
tour
the
country
calling
on

and
promoting
home
sowing
and
these
women
coordinate
their
work
with
the
local

as
to
introduce

to
this
youth
market
were

acquiring
the
habit
of
home
sowing.
the

sends
free
to
40,000
home
economics
teachers
a
monthly
--
a
magazine
periodically
devoted
to
promoting
home
sowing.
they
have
a
nationwide
4-h
program
devoted
to
promoting
home
sowing.
the
company
spends
$200,000
a
year
in
sending
fashion
posters
and
fashion
design
material
to
these
fabric
stores
and
this
don't
portray
the
pattern,
they
portray
the
finished
dress
that
it's
hoped
the
women
will
see
in
the
store
of
the
window
and
come
in
and
buy
the
ingredients,
most
of
which
is
fabrics
to
make
that
dress.
and
finally,
from
six
to
10
times
a
year,
they
send
to
these
fabric
merchants
from
new
york
throughout
the
country
the
latest
style
information
on
women's
fashions
and
women's
designs
of
new
dresses.
and
these
are
used
by
the
fabric
merchants
to
promote
the
sale
of
fabrics
which
is
what
they're
really
interested
in.
in
these
matters,
the
company
spends
more
than
a
million
dollars
a
year,
none
of
it
is
charged
to
the
fabric
merchants.
if
permitted
to
do
so
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
because
we
had
not
been
permitted
to
do
so,
we
can
readily
prove
that
not
--
the
--
as
mr.
weston
said,
the
small
fabric
merchants
get
the
short-end
of
the
stick.
we
can
prove
they
get
the
long-end
of
the
stick
because
we
spend
more
on
what
we
do
for
them
than
what
we
do
for
the
red
fronts
and
if
the
commission
--
mr.
william
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
william
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
william
simon
not
--
certainly
not
of
equal
benefit,
mr.
justice
stewart.
our
women
who
go
to
the
schools
and
promote
home
sowing
in
the
economics
department
at
the
schools,
they
bring
the
local
fabric
merchant
over
by
the
hand
and
introduce
them
and
promote
them.
the
red
fronts
stores
don't
even
have
personnel
that
they
can
send
to
a
school
to
coordinate
these
promotional
activities.
we
give
them
these
large
fashion
posters
which
we
spend
$200,000
a
year
on
the
red
fronts
use,
and
they're
helpful.
the
10-cent
stores
have
no
place
for
it.
now,
granted
that
many
of
the
things
we
do
have
a
benefit
that
applies
to
anybody
who
carry
simplicity
patterns.
but
the
great
bulk
of
this
home
sowing
program,
particularly
the
fashion
material,
the
design
material,
promotes
the
sale
of
fabrics
in
the
fabric
stores
and
isn't
used
and
in
the
very
nature
of
their
operation
couldn't
be
used
by
the
10-cent
stores.
might
i,
at
this
point,
mr.
justice
stewart,
elaborate
on
the
answer
of
mr.
weston
gave
you
to
the
question
this
morning
as
to
whether
we
had
6000
customers
whom
we
sold
at
a
--
a
loss,
and
he
said
that
was
hard
to
believe.
the
record
evidence,
however,
is
that
the
commission
lawyer
asked
the
president
of
simplicity
this
question
which
appears
at
page
232
of
the
record.
question,
“you
testified
earlier
that
your
company
had
6000
accounts
selling
$400
a
year
or
less
and
they
were
unprofitable.
have
you
eliminated
any
of
them?”
answer,
“we
have
not
eliminated
any
of
them.
we
have
never
eliminated
a
customer
who
has
paid
his
bills
whether
he
has
been
profitable
or
unprofitable
in
the
years
i
have
been
president
of
this
company.”
and
then
at
page
284,
the
same
witness
in
response
to
another
question
by
commission
counsel
said,
“and
now,
we
have
always
thought
of
ourselves
as
the
common
denominator
in
the
pattern
business
and
that
is
that
we
sell
our
patterns
at
the
lowest
possible
price
for
the
best
possible
value
and
it
is
to
our
interest
to
have
simplicity
available
in
every
place
that
is
reasonable
for
it
to
be
sold.
if
we
can
get
as
popular
as
wrigley
chewing
gum
or
coca-cola,
so
much
the
better.”
and
finally
on
286,
commission
counsel
asked
him.
question,
“well,
anyway,
you
got
your
start
with
the
small
stores.”
answer,
“yes,
sir.”
question,
“and
now,
you
wouldn't
want
to
be
kind
of
like
a
man
that
gets
tired
of
its
wife
and
cast
her
off,
would
you?”
answer,
“i
certainly
would
not,
sir,
and
that
is
straight
unequivocal.
as
long
as
a
small
merchant
conforms
to
the
normal
business
practices
or
paying
his
bills
and
has
a
store
open,
he
is
going
to
get
service
from
simplicity
pattern
company
unless
it
is
made
impossible
for
me
to
do
so.”
there
is
an
advantage
to
this
company
in
having
the
widest
distribution
of
its
patterns
and
it
does
so
serving
6000
stores
at
a
loss.
mr.
william
simon
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
think
your
question,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
has
answered
it
because
you
have
said
that
they
were
in
competition.
mr.
william
simon
and
--
mr.
william
simon
our
--
mr.
william
simon
if
they
are
in
competition
with
each
other.
mr.
william
simon
if
one
of
them
is
selling
gasoline
purely
as
an
accommodation
to
his
customers
and
if
the
competitor
would
prefer
that
the
customers
buy
their
gasoline
from
this
other
man
because
that
would
somehow
make
money
for
him
and
i
couldn't
be
--
how
it
could
be
in
the
case
you
posed,
then
i
would
say
they
were
not
in
competition.
but
we're
in
the
unusual
situation,
mr.
justice
black,
where
these
fabric
stores
carry
patterns
solely
as
a
service
to
their
customers.
they
prefer
not
to
have
them.
they
want
--
mr.
william
simon
their
in
the
fabric
business,
sir.
mr.
william
simon
fabric
is
what
they
want
to
sell
and
these
35
cents
sales
of
a
pattern
take
a
lot
of
time.
they
have
to
have
a
lot
of
space
for
it
and
they
sell
the
pattern
only
because
it's
necessary
to
making
the
fabric
sale.
now,
when
a
woman
goes
to
the
10-cent
store
which
sells
patterns
but
does
not
sell
fabrics,
she
buys
the
pattern
at
the
10-cent
store,
she's
got
to
come
to
some
fabric
store
to
buy
her
fabrics.
mr.
william
simon
that's
--
mr.
william
simon
--
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
simon
that's
correct,
sir.
and
three
of
the
commission's
six
fabric
store
witnesses
said,
“i
wish
i
had
our
woolworth
and
or
kresby
on
either
side
of
me,
so
they
could
sell
the
women
the
patterns
and
then
i
could
sell
them
the
fabrics.”
mr.
william
simon
we
have
18,000
stores
selling
them,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
simon
their
--
no,
sir,
their
competitors.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
the
commission's
complaint
here
is
saying
that
what
we
do
for
the
red
fronts
is
service
discrimination.
it
might
equally
be
turned
around
and
say
that
what
we
do
for
the
fabric
stores
in
the
way
of
posters
and
styles
and
designs
if
that
too
is
discrimination.
what
each
group
gets
that
which
is
best
suited
to
their
own
needs
and
what
the
commission
is
charging
here
would
be
anomalous
to
charging
that
a
seller
discriminated
when
he
gave
suits
to
men
and
dresses
to
women
because
each
group
wasn't
given
the
same
that
the
other
group
was
given.
in
this
case,
the
complaint
for
procedural
purposes
was
divided
into
two
counts.
count
one
was
brought
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
charging
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
but
throughout
the
proceedings,
it
was
conceded
that
it
was
analogous
to
a
charge
of
price
discrimination
under
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
both
the
examiner
and
the
commission
applied
the
standards
of
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
some
75%
of
the
total
dollar
value
discriminations
were
charged
under
count
one
of
the
complaint.
we
did
not
dispute
that
certain
services,
certain
benefits
were
given
in
one
group
and
not
given
to
the
other.
the
issue
litigated
before
the
commission
as
whether
there
was
injury
to
competition.
and
at
the
close
of
the
administrative
hearing,
the
hearing
examiner
dismissed
count
one
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
showed
an
absence
of
probable
competitive
injury.
but
as
to
count
two,
he
said
that
it
was
a
per
se
statute
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
show
any
adverse
competitive
effect.
the
hearing
examiner
adopted
his
findings
and
his
conclusions.
and
i
think
it's
important
here
to
note
that
before
the
commission,
commission
counsel
argued
the
entire
group
of
discriminations
as
a
single
package
and
he
reached
this
25%
aggregate
discrimination
by
combining
discriminations
of
count
one
and
of
count
two,
and
saying
they
were
25%
and
that
proved
injury
to
competition.
the
commission
disagreed
and
dismissed
the
count
where
the
bulk
of
discriminations
occurred
on
the
ground
of
no
injury.
we
say
that
the
commission's
order
should
be
set
aside
for
three
reasons.
first,
that
there
is
no
competition
between
these
two
groups
of
customers
on
the
commission's
own
findings
of
fact
and
the
law
as
established
by
this
court.
and
secondly,
that
under
the
proviso
under
the
clause
in
the
first
half
of
subsection
2
(b),
we
are
permitted
the
affirmative
defense
of
showing
an
absence
of
competitive
injury
which
the
commission
here
found
and
under
the
same
subsection,
we
are
permitted
the
defense
of
cost
justification
which
the
commission
denied
as
the
opportunity
to
present.
in
the
automatic
canteen
case,
this
court
held
and
the
commission
has
never
disputed
that
this
statute
is
not
a
model
of
clarity.
it
contains
six
subsections.
subsection
(e)
relates
to
buyer
liability.
subsection
(b)
contains
the
affirmative
defenses
and
(a),
(c),
(d)
and
(e)
contained
prohibitions
against
seller
conduct.
subsection
(a)
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
seller
to
discriminate
in
price
in
the
course
of
interstate
commerce
where
the
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
and
where
the
discrimination
is
not
justified
by
differences
in
the
cost
of
sale,
manufacture
or
delivery.
subsection
(c)
has
nothing
to
do
with
discrimination
at
all.
it
is
the
only
one
of
these
statutes
that
is
violated
even
though
you
give
every
customer
the
same
treatment.
it
places
a
ban
on
the
payment
of
brokerage
to
the
buyer
or
the
buyer's
agent
and
presumably
was
intended
to
protect
the
broker,
and
it
is
violated
even
though
every
customer
gets
equal
brokerage.
subsection
(d)
prohibits
payment
of
allowances
for
promotional
or
advertising
activities
to
one
customer
which
are
not
made
available
on
proportionately
equal
terms
to
all
competing
customers.
and
subsection
(e),
the
one
here
at
issue
prohibits
discrimination
and
services
to
our
facilities
not
made
available
to
all
customers
on
proportionately
equal
terms.
now,
the
commission
argues
here
that
you
must
take
each
of
these
four
subsections
and
treat
them
an
isolation
and
that
you
will
not
consider
anyone
of
the
other
three
subsections
in
determining
the
scope
of
anyone
of
the
four.
but
at
the
outset,
they
are
met
by
the
facts
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
and
they
don't
disagree,
there
is
no
reference
in
subsection
2
(e)
to
interstate
commerce.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
we
will
read
in
from
2
(a)
the
interstate
commerce
provision
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
there
is
also
no
provision
in
2
(e)
that
the
customers
discriminated
against
must
be
in
competition
with
each
other.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
corn
products
case,
which
was
later
affirmed
by
this
court,
held
that
2
(e)
was
violated
only
where
the
discrimination
was
between
competing
customers.
and
the
commission
in
his
brief
here
concedes
that
you
will
read
in
2
--
2
(e)
the
competition
requirement
of
2
(d).
it
says
at
page
11
of
its
second
brief,
and
i
quote,
“subsection
2
(d)
is
expressly
limited
to
inequality
between
customers
competing
in
the
distribution
of
such
products
or
commodities.”
the
two
subsection
are
complementary
to
each
other
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
2
(e)
to
be
broader
in
scope
than
2
(d).
now,
conceding
that
the
statute
has
violated
only
if
these
two
groups
were
in
competition,
we
say
that
the
hearing
examiner's
findings
as
to
the
nature
of
the
business
of
each
of
these
two
groups
and
what
he
said
about
the
testimony
shows
that
they
were
not
in
competition
with
each
other.
at
page
24
of
the
record,
the
hearing
examiner
found
and
this
finding
was
later
adopted
by
the
commission,
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
“they,”
meaning
the
fabric
store
witnesses,
“emphasized
that
they
all
handled
patterns
only
to
sell
fabrics
and
because
their
customers
expect
the
service”.
none
of
the
witnesses
regards
the
competition
of
the
10-cent
store
in
the
sale
of
patterns
has
of
any
real
consequence.
in
fact,
two
of
the
witnesses
did
not
regard
themselves
as
being
in
competition
with
the
10-cent
store
at
all,
while
these
two
expressions
of
opinion
are,
of
course,
not
conclusive
on
the
fundamental
question
of
the
existence
of
competition.
they
served
to
emphasize
the
apparent
feeling
of
all
the
witnesses
that
they
are
sustaining
no
substantial
competitive
injury
as
the
result
of
a
more
favorable
treatment
accorded
the
10-cent
stores.
the
record
seems
clearly
to
be
without
any
substantial
evidence
warranting
a
finding
of
injury
to
competition.
and
in
another
part
of
his
findings
which
appears
at
page
294
of
the
record,
the
hearing
examiner
found,
and
i
quote
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“the
attitude
of
the
witnesses,
that
is
to
say
the
smaller
merchants
who
have
testified
in
this
case,
seemed
to
be
about
this,”
and
then
i'm
skipping
a
sentence,
“they
would
like
all
of
those
things
as
well
as
the
other
items
mentioned
in
the
complaint
but
none
of
the
witnesses
seemed
to
attach
any
real
significance
or
importance
to
any
of
those
things.”
no
witness
comes
in
complaining
about
any
of
these
matters.
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would
be
a
rather
strange
situation
for
the
federal
trade
commission
to
undertake
to
give
relief
to
a
group
of
merchants
who
apparently
do
not
need
any
relief,
that
is
to
say
they
are
indifferent
about
it.
mr.
william
simon
page
294,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
commission's
definition
of
competition
here
is
at
variants
with
any
definition
of
competition
in
an
antitrust
action.
conceding
that
there's
no
rivalry
between
these
people,
they
defined
competition
at
page
12
of
their
second
brief
vastly.
in
our
view,
however,
that
test
is
satisfied
by
the
facts
that
the
two
kinds
of
stores
sell
the
same
commodity
to
the
same
class
of
customers
in
the
same
area
and
no
other
proof
of
competitive
rivalry
is
required.
we
say
in
an
antitrust
case
that
there
must
be
competitive
rivalry
before
you
can
find
competition.
the
commission
says
this
is
a
per
se
statute,
if
you
give
them
ones
the
service
you
don't
give
it
to
the
other,
it's
per
se
illegal.
and
then
they
have
a
per
se
definition
of
competition,
if
you're
both
selling
the
same
thing
in
the
same
community,
you're
in
competition.
but
this
court
in
a
case
dealing
with
the
same
statute,
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
and
this
is
section
2
of
the
clayton
act,
in
the
international
shoe
case
held
that
competition
in
the
clayton
act
met
substantial
competition
and
that
it
did
not
apply.
at
least
section
7
did
not
apply
to
competition
which
was
not
substantial
or
of
consequence.
i'm
impressed
by
the
fact
that
we
relied
upon
that
case
in
our
opening
brief
and
it
has
not
been
mentioned
by
the
commission
in
their
reply
brief
although
my
good
friend
charles
weston
was
also
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
international
shoe
case.
in
addition
to
the
commission's
findings
of
no
rivalry,
which
we
say
is
a
matter
of
law,
under
the
shoe
case
means
no
competition.
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
morton
salt
case
compels
a
similar
conclusion.
and
the
commission
here
confesses
error
before
this
court
on
this
point,
although
we
are
not
in
agreement
as
to
what
is
the
error.
they
concede
that
under
morton
salt,
a
substantial
price
difference,
and
it
was
4%
in
that
case,
to
competing
customers
is
equated
to
competitive
injury
under
this
statute.
we
argue
a
fortiori
a
25%
discrimination
which
is
expressly
found
not
to
have
a
probable
adverse
competitive
effect,
must
necessarily
be
between
customers
who
are
not
in
competition.
the
commission
says
our
theory
is
right
and
if
there
was
any
error,
it
was
in
their
not
finding
an
injury
to
competition
under
count
one
and
that
they
should
have
found
that
the
25%
differential
did
result
in
an
injury
to
competition.
but
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
was
the
very
issue
litigated
below.
that
was
the
very
issue
to
which
all
the
testimony
was
directed.
and
in
their
argument
before
the
commission,
commission
counsel
said,
“this
25%
differential
is
so
big,
you
must
find
injury
to
competition.”
the
commission
rejected
that
argument.and
they
said
at
page
29
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
own
opinion
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“the
substance
of
the
argument
made
seems
to
be
that
the
total
value
of
the
preferences
granted
to
the
10-cent
stores
were
of
such
substantial
percentage
of
the
purchases
that
they
create
a
presumption
of
competitive
effect.
and
then
at
the
first
of
the
following
paragraph
they
say,
“as
appealing
as
this
argument
may
be,
it
is
clear
that
under
the
circumstances,
the
mere
showing
of
discrimination
among
customers
is
not
allowed.”
and
may
i
point
out
that
that
finding
isn't
before
this
court.
no
appeal
was
taken
and
in
fact
no
appeal
could
be
taken
by
the
commission
from
its
own
finding
of
adverse
competitive
effect.
and
if
it
is
conceded
that
the
finding
of
no
competitive
injury
cannot
stand
side
by
side
with
the
finding
of
competition
then
since
one
finding
has
not
been
brought
to
this
court,
it
must
that
the
latter
finding
must
fall.
but
apart
from
that
technical
point,
the
commission
itself
adjudicated
this
point.
it
was
litigated
and
they
found
no
competitive
injury.
with
respect
to
the
defenses
based
on
the
language
of
section
2
(b),
i
would
like
to
say
initially
that
we
do
not
urge
that
the
proviso
of
2
(a)
must
be
read
into
2
(e).
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
elizabeth
arden
case
held
that
that
was
not
required,
and
we
do
not
contend
otherwise.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
but
we
do
contend
that
the
language
of
section
2
(b)
contains
a
bridge
which
when
you
read
the
entire
statute
makes
clear
that
there
is
an
affirmative
defense
and
we
concede
the
burden
is
on
us
to
prove
the
absence
of
competitive
injury
or
cost
justification.
we
concede
the
commission
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
by
merely
showing
the
different
treatment
to
the
competing
customers,
but
2
(b)
in
clear
language
gives
us
this
affirmative
defense.
and
there
are
three
factors
that,
to
me,
illustrate
the
merit
of
our
position
and
the
weakness
of
the
commission's
position.
the
commission
said
if
there's
price
discrimination,
then
it's
a
defense
to
show
cost
justification,
it's
a
defense
to
show
no
injury
to
competition.
but
it
if
it's
price
--
if
it's
service
discrimination,
those
defenses
aren't
unavailable.
therefore,
had
simplicity
given
the
red
fronts
a
price
reduction
of
an
exactly
equal
amount
to
the
value
of
these
cabinets
and
catalogues,
the
commission
would
say,
“you're
free.”
in
fact,
they
would
then
have
been
under
count
one
which
was
dismissed.we
would
have
no
liability.
but
while
it
would
be
proper
for
us
to
give
them
a
price
reduction
of
the
same
value,
the
commission
says
it's
per
se
unlawful
to
give
them
the
same
value
if
you
put
a
label
of
services
and
facilities
on
it.
secondly,
the
2
(b)
section
contains
two
parts.
the
first
part
reads
in
terms
of
justification.
it
says,
“the
seller
may
justify.”
the
second
part
reads
in
terms
of
excuse.
the
second
part
says,
“if
you
have
violated
this
impact,
if
you
created
competitive
injury,
if
you
can't
cost
justify,
you
may
still
excuse
your
violation
by
showing
that
you
were
meeting
the
services
and
facilities
of
a
competitor.”
it
seems
to
us
unthinkable
that
congress
would
say,
“you
don't
have
the
right
to
justify
this
action
by
showing
that
nobody
was
injured,
that
there
was
cost
justification,
but
you
do
have
the
right
to
excuse
and
even
though
there
was
injury
and
was
no
cost
justification.”
and
thirdly,
we
can
conceive
of
no
reason
why
congress
should
treat
price
discrimination
so
very
differently
than
service
or
facilities
discrimination
without
there
being
some
reason
why
congress
thought
one
was
more
iniquitous
than
the
other.
mr.
william
simon
mr.
weston
gave
three
points
this
morning.
the
first
of
which
was
substantially
what
your
honor
has
said.
i
don't
see
how
it's
any
easier
to
hide
service
discrimination
than
it
is
to
send
customer's
rebate.
there
are
many
cases
in
the
books
where
a
big
buyer
is
charged
$10
a
dozen
for
the
commodity.
he
gets
a
$10
dozen
bill
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year,
they
give
him
back
the
rebate.
that's
a
common
thing
and
yet
that's
difficult
to
please.
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
facts
here.
mr.
weston
added
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
measure
the
value
of
service
discrimination,
price
discrimination
you
measure
it
easily.
he
said
it
was
more
difficult
to
measure
the
value
of
service
discrimination.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
this
is
an
affirmative
burden
imposed
on
us.
if
we
can't
measure
it,
we
don't
prevail.
mr.
weston
also
says
--
said
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
measure
injury
to
competition
resulting
from
service
discrimination.
but
again,
that's
a
burden
on
us.
if
we
can't
meet
that
burden,
we
lose.
and
finally,
he
said
it
would
make
it
more
difficult
to
try
the
cases.
and
of
course,
i
concur
in
that
when
you
make
anything
a
per
se
violation,
the
government
can
try
its
case
in
two
or
three
minutes.
but
in
an
antitrust
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cardinal
objective
of
the
statutes
and
of
the
court's
interpretation
should
be
to
protect
and
preserve
competition
and
where
something
is
done
which
is
competitively
healthy,
it
seems
inconsistent
to
me
to
deny
the
legality
of
it
merely
because
of
the
label
which
attaches
to
it.
in
fact,
in
the
motion
picture
advertising
case
which
was
another
federal
trade
commission
case
involving
a
sister
statute
in
an
opinion
of
this
court
by
mr.
justice
douglas
this
court
said
referring
to
the
anti-trust
cases,
“the
crucial
fact
is
the
impact
of
a
particular
practice
on
competition
not
the
label
it
carries.”
and
we
submit
here
the
commission
makes
the
crucial
fact
of
the
label.
if
you
call
it
service,
then
these
defenses
aren't
available.
if
you
call
it
price,
then
we
have
all
of
them
available.
mr.
william
simon
that
was
motion
picture
advertising
versus
federal
trade
commission
which
was
a
section
5,
federal
trade
commission
case
attacking
a
tying
arrangement
in
the
leasing
of
advertising
space
in
motion
picture
theatres
and
while
brought
under
section
5,
this
court
applied
the
rules
of
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
and
found
the
practice
illegal.
and
there,
they
were
contending
that
they
didn't
strictly
come
within
the
letter
of
the
statute.
and
this
court
said,
“it
isn't
the
label
that
carries,
it's
the
impact
of
the
practice
on
competition.”
the
commission
has
referred
here
to
the
legislative
history
as
supporting
their
view.
we
say
the
legislative
history
is
exactly
to
the
contrary.
as
mr.
weston
said
the
robinson
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate.
the
patman
bill
was
introduced
in
the
house.
the
senate
bill
was
reported
out
with
no
2
(b)
provision
in
it
at
all.
the
patman
bill
was
reported
out
in
the
house
with
a
2
(b)
provision
like
the
present
one
except
that
it
did
not
mention
services
or
facilities.
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
the
2
(b)
amendment,
as
it
now
appears,
was
offered
and
accepted
by
the
sponsor
and
the
house
then
added
services
and
facilities
to
its
bill
in
order
to
conform
to
what
the
senate
had
done
and
both
bills
were
then
alike.
to
me,
the
most
significant
fact
is
that
senator
robinson
certainly
didn't
think
he
was
changing
the
purposes
of
the
bill
by
expressly
saying,
“you
can
justify
discrimination
and
services
and
facilities,”
because
they
thought
that
could
be
done
under
the
bill
without
the
provision.
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
on
this
legislation
under
a
section
entitled
“analysis
of
the
bill”
contain
a
paragraph
which
is
verbatim
identical
except
for
the
first
two
or
three
words.
the
senate
bill
on
page
3
of
the
report
it
starts
out
by
saying,
“the
bill
proposes
to
amend
section
2.”
the
house
bill
starts
--
the
house
report,
which
is
on
page
7
of
the
report
starts
out,
“the
object
of
the
bill
briefly
stated
is
to
amend
section
2.”
from
thereon,
both
reports
are
identical.
and
this
is
what
they
say,
“the
bill
proposes
to
amend
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
so
as
to
suppress
more
effectively
discriminations
between
customers
of
the
same
seller,
not
supported
by
sound
economic
differences
in
their
business'
position
or
in
the
cost
of
serving
them.
such
discriminations
are
sometimes
affected
directly
in
prices
or
terms
of
sale
and
sometimes
by
separate
allowances
to
favored
customers
for
purported
services
or
other
considerations
which
are
unjustly
discriminatory
in
their
result
against
other
customers.”
the
bill
is
accordingly
drawn
in
four
subsections
of
which
the
first
three
contains
substantive
measures
directed
at
the
more
prevalent
terms
of
discrimination,
while
the
fourth
is
designed
to
facilitate
private
remedies
and
damages
to
persons
immediately
and
actually
injured.
significantly
there,
they
didn't
talk
about
price
discrimination
when
they
said,
“the
bill
didn't
prohibit
discriminations
which
were
justified
by
economic
differences.”
they
talked
about
discriminations
and
then
they
made
it
crystal
clear
that
it
wasn't
limited
to
price
discriminations
by
saying
that
these
discriminations
are
sometimes
in
price
and
sometimes
in
these
other
matters.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
simon
such
discriminations
are
sometimes
affected
directly
in
price
or
terms
of
sale
and
sometimes
by
separate
allowances
to
favored
customers
for
purported
services
or
other
considerations
which
are
unjustly
discriminatory.
but
the
important
thing,
mr.
justice
black,
is
even
though
it's
purported
discriminations,
they
say
are
not
intended
to
be
prohibited
by
this
bill
if
they
are
justified
by
sound
economic
differences
in
their
business
position
or
in
the
cost
of
serving
them.
and
here,
we
can
prove
that
these
differences
are
more
than
justified
by
differences
in
the
cost
of
serving
them
and
we
say
they
are
justified
by
economic
differences
in
the
finding
that
there
was
no
adverse
effect
upon
competition.
mr.
william
simon
i
don't
believe
so
that
it
does
show
which
is
not
far
from
what
you
say
that
the
large
grocery
chains
frequently
receive
brokerage
commissions
--
mr.
william
simon
--
for
brokerage
if
they
did
not
perform.
and
of
course,
in
section
2
(c),
congress
said
it's
illegal
to
pay
brokerage
even
though
you
pay
it
to
every
customer.
the
brokerage
provision
was
one
where
they
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
discrimination.
they
said,
“brokerage
is
illegal
no
matter
if
everybody
gets.”
but
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
history
of
covering
up
price
discriminations
by
giving
something
in
the
nature
of
services
although
there
was
that
on
brokerage.
mr.
william
simon
well,
of
course,
all
--
most
of
the
legislative
history
here
applied
to
the
grocery
trade.
mr.
william
simon
and
the
bill
was
--
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
anp
was
the
principle
objective
that
was
talked
about
in
the
legislative
hearings.
but
time
and
again,
the
congressman
said,
“now,
we're
not
trying
to
prevent
any
price
differences
or
any
differences
in
services
or
facilities
that
are
justified
by
the
cost
of
doing
business
between
the
two
groups.”
and
this
court
itself
--
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir,
and
--
and
that's
what
we
contend
for
here,
mr.
justice
black.
this
court
has
said
--
mr.
william
simon
we
claim
three
things,
mr.
justice
black.
first,
that
if
the
two
groups
of
customers
who
were
given
different
treatment
are
not
in
competition
with
each
other,
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
the
government
agrees
what's
on
the
law
that
a
competition
is
required
but
we
have
a
legal
issue
as
to
what
constitutes
competition
in
effect.
mr.
william
simon
of
competition.
yes.
mr.
william
simon
we
say
the
competition
requires
commercial
rivalry
and
if
there
is
no
commercial
rivalry,
they
aren't
in
competition.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
simon
mr.
justice
black,
women
generally
use
dental
floss
to
spring
pearls.
tiffany's
will
sell
you
a
spool
of
dental
floss
to
spring
pearls
and
the
woolworth
store
around
the
corner
on
fifth
avenue
wood.
but
i
would
hardly
say
that
tiffany's
was
in
competition
with
woolworth
although
they
both
have
dental
floss.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
your
--
mr.
william
simon
but
here
is
a
case,
mr.
justice
black.
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
a
man
named
merber
(ph)
who
had
a
fabric
store
on
seventh
street
here
in
washington.
he
said,
“i
can't
make
a
profit
on
any
sale
in
my
store
of
less
than
$2.50
because
when
i
have
to
have
a
salesclerk
wait
on
the
woman
and
give
her
a
time
that
the
sale
is
less
than
$2.50,
i've
lost
money
on
it.”
the
10-cent
store,
on
the
other
hand,
he
said
is
key
to
these
small
items
sales.
they
have
a
girl
stand
behind
the
counter
and
he
does
a
lot
and
he
actually
testified,
sir,
that
he
would
pay
part
of
the
rent
of
the
woolworth's
store
if
they'd
open
one
next
door.
mr.
william
simon
but,
mr.
justice
black,
the
record
evidence
is
here
that
the
pattern
--
that
the
fabric
stores
would
loose
money
on
patterns
even
if
they
got
the
same
terms
as
the
red
fronts
and
they
would
probably
loose
money
on
patterns
if
they
got
them
for
nothing
--
mr.
william
simon
--
because
--
mr.
william
simon
yes,
your
honor,
and
to
that
extent,
the
woolworth
stores
may
be
injured,
but
the
commission's
complaint
here
precedes
on
exactly
the
opposite
premise.
it
says
that
the
red
front
is
injured
by
what
we
give
the
woolworth
store,
whereas
the
fact
is
the
red
front
benefits
every
time
woolworth
sells
a
pattern
because
a
woman
who
buys
a
pattern
from
woolworth
can
do
nothing
with
it,
but
take
it
to
a
--
sir?
mr.
william
simon
well,
i've
treated
them
interchangeably,
mr.
justice
brennan.
red
fronts
as
we
call
them
include
woolworth,
kresby,
all
these
10-cent
stores
or
variety
stores
that
generally
have
the
front
of
their
store
painted
red.
if
i
may
get
back
to
your
earlier
request,
mr.
justice
black,
in
addition
to
the
argument,
we
contend
that
there's
no
competition.
we
secondly
contend
that
if
these
differences
can
be
cost
justified
as
congress,
i
think,
made
clear
they
didn't
intend
to
deny
if
the
differences
can
be
cost
justified
and
we
say
it's
our
affirmative
burden
of
proof
to
do
it.
we
should
prevail
the
--
mr.
william
simon
and
in
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
witness
and
remanded
to
the
commission
to
accept
evidence
which
they
had
rejected
on
the
cost
justification.
and
our
third
point
is
that
the
commission
has
affirmatively
found
an
absence
of
competitive
injury
here
and
we
--
we
rely
on
their
affirmative
findings
and
we
say
that
the
absence
of
competitive
injury
is
a
--
an
affirmative
defense
and
we
have
established
affirmative
defense
and
we're
entitled
to
prevail
on
that
score.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
while
disagreeing
with
us
on
the
law
on
that
point,
did
agree
with
us
on
the
fact
that
there
was
affirmative
finding
of
no
injury
to
competition.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
on
page
333
it
said,
“even
though
absence
of
competitive
injury
was
here
shown,
that
fact
is
immaterial
to
the
point
we
here
discuss
because
section
2
(e),”
and
so
on.
the
commission's
findings
affirming
the
hearing
examiner
were
of
the
same
effect.
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
on
page
23
of
the
record
at
paragraph
number
10,
“true,
there
is
no
showing
of
competitive
injury,”
but
this,
as
the
examiner
understand,
is
not
required
in
a
proceeding
under
section
2
(e).
mr.
william
simon
the
statutory
language,
mr.
justice
black,
is
where
the
effect
maybe
substantially
less
than
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
or
injure,
prevent
or
destroy
competition
with
the
beneficiary
of
the
discrimination.
that,
i
think
verbatim,
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
when
the
examiner
and
the
commission
used
competitive
injury,
i
think
it
was
a
shorthand
phrase
for
that
longer
statutory
phrase.
if
i
may
get
back
to
the
point
discussed
before
the
recess,
this
court
has
held
in
many
cases
that
wherever
possible,
every
phrase,
every
clause,
every
provision
of
a
statute
will
be
given
meaning.
the
commission's
position
here
frankly
requires
you
to
read
out
of
the
statute
the
first
clause
of
subsection
2
(b)
and
that
clause
clearly
was
not
limited
to
price
discrimination
because
the
congress
expressly
talked
about
discrimination
and
service
as
their
facilities.
it
appears
at
page
26
of
the
commission's
first
brief,
at
the
middle
of
the
page.
i
might
say
that
the
second
half
of
the
paragraph
beginning
with
the
“provided”
relates
to
the
meeting
competition
defense
which
was
before
this
court
in
standard
oil
versus
federal
trade
commission
but
which
is
not
here.
but
the
first
clause
says
“upon
proof
being
made
at
any
hearing
on
a
complaint
under
this
section
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
price
or
services
or
facilities
furnished,
the
burden
of
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case
does
made
by
showing
justification
shall
be
on
the
person
charged
with
a
violation
of
this
section
and
unless
justification
shall
be
affirmatively
shown,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
issue
an
order.”
congress
could
not
have
more
clearly
said
that
you
may
justify
a
discrimination
in
services
or
facilities,
yet
the
commission
says
you
can't
do
it.
the
commission
says
there
is
no
justification
for
a
discrimination
in
services
or
facility.
they
said
the
only
way
you
can
avoid
liability
is
by
showing,
meaning
competition,
which
is
expressly
provided
for
in
the
lower
half.
if
the
justification
is
to
be
given
some
meaning,
and
we
submit
that
it
must
be
given
meaning,
we
suggest
three
places
the
court
might
look
to
determine
the
criteria
of
such
meaning.
the
first
is
in
the
overall
statute
itself.
what
was
congress
trying
to
get
at
it
in
the
statute?
and
we
look
to
section
2
(a)
and
we
find
that
congress
said,
“we
don't
mean
to
prohibit
price
discriminations
where
they
are
cost
justified
or
where
there
is
no
probability
of
competitive
effect.
and
we
read
the
justification
clause
of
2
(b)
as
applying
to
the
things
congress
talked
about
in
2
(a).
the
difference
is
that
in
2
(a),
injury
to
competition
is
made
a
part
of
the
commission's
prima
facie
case.
they
must
prove
it
there,
but
in
2
(b),
congress
said,
“these
matters
of
justification
are
an
affirmative
defense
of
the
seller.”
secondly,
we
would
suggest
looking
to
the
legislative
history
to
see
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
the
committee
reports,
particularly
the
quotation
that
i
read
a
few
moments
ago,
make
clear
that
they
were
not
intending
to
prevent
discriminations
either
price
or
services
which
were
justified
by
economic
differences
between
the
parties
or
by
cross
differences.
in
fact,
this
court
has
said
in
the
automatic
canteen
case
referring
to
this
very
statute,
and
i
quote
from
the
court's
opinion,
“time
and
again,
there
was
recognition
in
congress
of
a
freedom
to
adapt
and
pass
on
to
buyers
the
benefits
of
more
economical
processes.”
and
that's
exactly
what
we
urged
here,
the
right
to
pass
on
these
benefits.
on
the
subject
of
cost
justification,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
evidence
is
that
two
people
in
the
company's
office
handled
all
of
the
correspondents
in
details
with
all
of
the
chain
stores.
80%
of
the
personnel
are
devoted
to
the
work
with
the
fabric
shops.
the
company
has
a
core
salesman
whose
salary
and
expense
accounts
amount
to
$20,000
a
year
who
calls
on
the
fabric
shops.
no
salesman
called
on
the
red
fronts.
that's
all
handled
with
the
home
office
of
each
red
front.
in
addition,
we
spend
in
excess
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
on
these
promotional
activities
which
include
the
posters
and
style,
design,
material
that
goes
to
the
store.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
including
particularly
the
cost
of
salesman
to
call
on
one
and
don't
on
the
other
which
is
always
been
accepted
by
the
commission
as
a
proper
criteria
for
cost
justification.
finally,
the
profitability
of
a
customer
to
a
pattern
company
depends
on
the
number
of
pattern
he
buys
and
paid
for
in
relation
to
the
number
of
patterns
he
throws
away.
the
pattern
company
that
mr.
weston
said,
“three
times
a
year
withdraw
all
the
old
items
from
the
line,
they're
thrown
away.”
and
obviously
we're
replacing
a
new
one,
but
if
we
replace
two
for
each
he
pays
for,
we
don't
make
very
much
money
of
it.
one
witness
testified
in
this
case
that
he
had
paid
for
$178
of
patterns
in
the
whole
year
that
he
had
reordered
in
which
he
paid
for,
but
he
had
thrown
away
for
a
credit
$328
worth
of
patterns,
and
we
asked
him,
“do
you
think
you're
a
profitable
customer
for
the
pattern
company?”
and
he
said,
“that's
the
pattern
company's
worry.
frankly,
as
long
as
they're
happy
with
the
situation,
so
am
i.”
and
his
testimony
that
was
the
witness
dodson
is
at
page
152
of
this
record.
the
commission
gives
us
three
choices
here.
they
say
that
we
can
take
these
very
unprofitable
customers
who
are
already
losing
money
on
but
we
want
to
serve
if
we
can
and
we
can
make
them
even
more
unprofitable
by
giving
them
free
cabinets
and
free
catalogues
even
though
the
business
doesn't
justify.
and
presumably,
if
their
decision
is
to
be
rationalized,
we
must
also
give
the
red
fronts
these
expensive
posters
if
they
have
no
place
to
put
and
don't
care
for.
or
secondly,
the
commission
says,
“you
can
give
up
the
red
fronts,”
because
the
evidence
here
is
that
if
the
red
fronts
had
to
pay
for
all
these
services,
they
couldn't
make
a
profit
and
they
wouldn't
carry
the
patterns.
and
if
we
did
that,
the
fabric
stores
would
be
injured
because
a
diminution
in
patterns
they
have
--
would
hurt
us
but
it
would
hurt
the
fabric
stores
a
lot
more
because
the
red
fronts
do
not
sell
yard
goods
and
when
the
woman
buys
the
pattern
in
a
red
front,
she's
got
to
go
to
some
fabric
store
to
get
her
fabrics.
or
thirdly,
the
commission
says,
“you
can
give
up
doing
business
with
these
unprofitable
fabrics
stores
and
don't
sell
them
at
all.”
and
we
submit
that
neither
of
those
alternatives
is
in
the
public
interest.
i
would
like
to
conclude,
if
i
may,
by,
again,
referring
to
the
motion
picture
advertising
case
where
the
court
said
that
in
an
antitrust
case,
“the
crucial
fact
was
the
impact
of
the
particular
practice
on
competition
and
not
the
label
it
carries.”
and
the
commission
concedes
that
their
whole
case
here
is
dependent
on
giving
this
the
label,
services
and
facilities.
thank
you,
sir.
