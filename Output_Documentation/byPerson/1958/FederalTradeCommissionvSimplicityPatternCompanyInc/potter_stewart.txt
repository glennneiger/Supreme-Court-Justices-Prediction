justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
that
simplicity
also
lost
money
in
dealing
with
those
small
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
they
gave
us
--
because
of
the
destruction
of
the
patterns
that
it
go
out
of
date,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
claim,
i
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
while
you're
still
on
the
facts,
mr.
weston,
for
my
own
clarification,
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
understand.
what
you
called
ten
cent
stores
are
what
i
call
the
red
front
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
red
front
stores.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
so-called
fabric
shops
include
small
specialty
shops?
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as,
large
department
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
three
classifications.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
fabric
store
group
would
be
then
a
specialty
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
they
typically
of
small
independent
units?
do
the
record
show
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
12,000
in
patterns?
justice
potter
stewart
or
fabrics?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
that
some
of
the
fabric
stores
actually
operated
their
pattern
--
pattern
part
of
their
business
at
a
loss?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
does
appear
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
to
that
extent,
as
an
alternative.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
fabric
stores
gave
these
patterns
away?
you
couldn't
have
competition
then,
would
you?
(voice
overlap)
gave
--
gave
the
customer's
opinion
about
fabrics.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
your
position,
mr.
weston,
that
the
only
justification
provided
in
the
statute
for
a
violation
of
(e)
is
that
which
appears
in
the
proviso
in
(b),
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
of
course
--
primarily,
mr.
simon,
those
expenditures
that
you've
mentioned
are
for
your
--
in
your
own
interest
obviously.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
simplicity's
interest
to
sell
these
patterns
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
where
they
can
be
sold.
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly,
some
of
those
expenditures
at
least
that
you
just
told
us
about
promoting
home
sowing
and
so
on
would
be,
would
they
not,
of
equal
primary
benefit
and
of
course,
the
purpose
is
to
benefit
simplicity?
but
wouldn't
they
also
be
of
equal
benefit
to
the
red
fronts
stores
as
to
the
fabric
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
it
found?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there
is
a
reason
suggested
--
i
don't
think
an
oral
argument
today
but
suggested
in
the
government
counsel's
brief
and
that
is
that
price
discrimination
as
the
very
evident
and
obvious
thing
usually
and
discrimination
and
pricing
services
can
be
hidden
an
obvious
of
invisible
kind
of
a
thing
and
that
one
therefore
as
much
easier
to
please
than
the
other.
i
think,
as
i
understood
the
argument,
their
brief
was
something
along
those
lines.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
suggesting
that
not
that
the
decision
is
before
us,
but
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
you
would
present
to
the
commission?
