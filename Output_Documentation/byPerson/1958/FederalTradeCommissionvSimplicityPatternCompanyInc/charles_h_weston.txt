mr.
charles
h.
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
involved
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
which
was
issued
under
subsection
(e)
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
section
2
(e)
makes
it
unlawful
to
discriminate
by
furnishing
services
or
facilities
to
a
purchaser
upon
terms
not
furnished
--
upon
terms
not
given
in
proportionally
equal
terms
to
all
purchasers.
the
complaint
which
the
commission
filed,
charged
simplicity
pattern
with
violating
section
2
(e)
and
also
with
violating
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
commission
dismissed
the
trade
commission
act
charge
and
it
is
not
in
issue.
simplicity
does
not
sell
its
patterns
direct
to
the
public.
it
sells
to
ten
cent
store
chains
such
as
woolworth
and
kresge
to
so-called
fabric
stores
and
to
department
stores.
the
discrimination
which
was
found
was
in
furnishing
catalogues
and
cabinets
which
i
will
describe
later
to
ten
cent
stores
on
terms
which
were
entirely
different
from
the
terms
in
which
it
furnished
them
to
fabric
stores.
there
were
also
discriminations
in
the
services
rendered
these
two
classes
of
stores.
simplicity
makes
no
charge
for
the
catalogues
which
it
furnishes
to
the
ten
cent
stores.
it
also
makes
no
charge
to
the
cabinets
furnished
to
them.
it
charges
the
fabric
stores
for
every
catalogue
and
every
cabinet
furnished
to
them.
it
makes
no
charge
to
the
ten
cent
store
chains,
the
cost
of
transportation
on
these
catalogues,
cabinets
and
patterns
also.
it
requires
the
fabric
stores
to
pay
this
cost
of
transportation.
it
requires
the
fabric
stores
to
pay
for
their
initial
stock
of
simplicity
patterns.
it
does
not
require
the
ten
cent
stores
to
pay
anything
for
their
initial
stock
of
patterns.
so
it
is
that
simplicity,
there's
the
cost
of
carrying
the
entire
inventory
of
the
ten
cent
stores
and
this
is
not
negligible
in
amount
for
these
ten
cent
store
customers
had
a
pattern
and
inventory
that
was
close
to
a
$1,800,000.00.
these
various
preferences
were
equivalent
to
a
price
discrimination
of
more
than
25%.
the
preference
was
also
of
the
large
barrier
over
the
small.
that
is
a
preference
which
congress
considered
to
be
an
evil
and
which
the
robinson-patman
act
was
designed
to
prevent.
the
pattern
which
simplicity
makes
consists
of
several
pieces
of
tissue
paper
which
give
designs
and
directions
for
making
dresses
and
garments.
simplicity
puts
out
about
40
new
patterns
each
month
and
it
discards
about
the
same
number.
it
maintains
approximately
600
patterns
in
its
current
list.
it
sells
to
all
retail
stores
at
60%
of
the
retail
price
and
that
price
is
stand
on
the
pattern.
now,
a
catalogue
which
lifts
the
current
offerings
is
essential
to
retail
sale
that
was
specifically
found.
the
prospective
purchaser
looks
through
the
catalogue
to
find
out
what
is
offered
and
what
will
suit
their
needs
and
then
buys
whatever
pattern
is
selected.
simplicity
issues
a
new
catalogue
each
month
and
it
furnishes
one
or
more
of
these
catalogues
to
every
store
which
handles
its
patterns.
it
also
furnishes,
to
these
stores,
cabinets,
steel
cabinets.
they're
made
by
a
steel
fabricator
according
to
simplicity's
specifications
and
designed
to
be
convenient
store
containers
for
simplicity
patterns.
the
original
stock
of
patterns
are
shipped
to
the
store
in
one
or
more
of
these
cabinets
and
the
store
later
adds
to
its
patent
--
to
the
pattern
stock,
which
it
carries
and
needs
more
cabinets
while
simplicity
will
furnish
them.
now,
the
cabinets
which
were
furnished
to
the
fabric
stores
were
somewhat
superior
quality
to
those
which
were
furnished
to
ten
cent
stores.
i
submit
that
on
the
question
of
discrimination,
this
is
absolutely
immaterial.
whatever
the
fabric
store
got,
it
paid
for.
and
what
the
ten
cent
store
got,
it
got
free
and
without
charge.
simplicity
has
seven
ten
cent
store
customers
and
about
24%
of
its
sales
are
to
these
--
these
ten
cent
store
chains.
of
course,
there
are
many
stores
in
the
chain
and
there
where
over
1800
in
the
worldwide
chain.
simplicity
makes
its
contract
with
the
chain,
but
each
store
in
a
chain
individually
orders
and
reorders
the
patterns
which
it
wants.
therefore,
as
far
as
servicing
was
concerned,
these
stores
were
serviced
individually
just
as
the
fabric
store
would
be.
and
at
least
in
some
areas,
the
average
purchases
of
the
ten
cent
stores
was
less
that
the
average
purchases
of
the
fabric
store
customers
of
simplicity.
now,
i've
used
the
designation,
fabric
store.
that
is
meant
to
cover
dry
good
stores
and
fabric
shops
which
carry
a
large
assortment
of
fabrics.
they
sell
patterns
primarily
to
promote
their
fabric
sales.
they
are,
in
a
sense,
captive
customers.
the
bargaining
power
is
very
weak,
because
each
individuals,
the
purchases
of
each
individual
store
infinitesimal
compared
to
the
purchases
of
one
of
these
ten
cent
store
chains,
the
--
the
chains
bought
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
patterns
each
year,
woolworth
bought
well,
over
1
million,
but
simplicity
had
6000
some
--
up
around
6000
fabric
store
customers,
but
less
than
$400
worth
of
simplicity's
pattern
each
year.
it's
not
surprising
that
these
stores
got
the
short-end
of
the
deal
and
that
they
generally
lost
money
on
their
pattern
business.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
claimed
that
it
did.
it
had
a
very
curious
way
of
arriving
at
--
at
that
--
at
the
result
that
it
--
it
did
lose
money.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
the
claim.
let's
look
at
that
a
little
bit
though.
the
store
pays
for
the
patterns
it
gets
originally.
simplicity
just
simulates
sales
when
it's
a
constant
flow
of
new
patterns.
it
can't
have
thousands
on
the
market
at
once.
it
discards
certain
ones
as
outdated
that
the
store
has
one
of
the
old
patterns.
it's
paid
for
it.
simplicity
doesn't
lose
money
and
that,
it
merely
sends
out
some
new
two
pieces
of
tissue
paper
representing
a
new
pattern.
it
gets
a
credit
against
what
it
paid
for
the
first
pattern
which
is
not
been
sold
against
the
new
pattern.
it
hardly
stands
to
reason
that
simplicity,
out
of
mere
goodness
of
heart,
would
continue
to
do
business
with
6000
customers
with
whom
it
was
asked
of
which
it
was
losing
money.
it
had
about
10,000
fabric
store
customers
in
all.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
i
used
a
phrase
--
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
no.
the
department
stores
are
separate.
there
were
those
three
classifications.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
the
commission
limited
its
evidence
and
all
the
findings
are
limited
solely
to
the
ten
cent
store
group
and
the
fabric
store
group,
not
department
stores.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
not
necessarily
a
specialty.
of
course,
they
carry
--
most
of
them
at
least,
carry
other
things
than
fabrics,
but
they
had
a
substantial
pattern
--
fabric
department.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
they
are.
they're
all
independent.
they
--
and
they
--
certainly,
most
of
them
are
very
small.
the
record
did
show
one
that
had
purchases
of
something
like
12,000
which
of
course
was
entirely
a
typical
one,
as
to
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
but
--
no,
patterns.
that
was
very
unusual,
if
not
at
all,
typical.
i
--
i
think
that
that
was
--
a
few
of
the
fabric
stores
would
carry
patterns
of
other
makers
than
simplicity
and
i
think
that
in
that
case,
they
carried
three
different
kinds
of
patterns.
now,
the
commission
--
the
case
went
through
the
usual
administrative
process
to
this
initial
decision
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
then
that
was
carried
to
the
commission
and
it
rendered
an
opinion.
in
that
opinion,
it
adopted
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
examiner
and
it
found,
which
really
wasn't
disputed
that
simplicity
did
discriminate
in
the
services
and
facilities
which
it
furnished.
it
found
that
the
ten
cent
stores
and
the
fabric
stores
compete
in
the
sale
of
simplicity
patterns.
it
ruled
that
these
facts
established
a
violation
of
section
2
(e)
and
that
is
not
necessary
to
show,
in
addition,
that
the
fabric
stores
were
injured
by
the
discriminations.
it
also
ruled
that
in
a
proceeding
under
section
2
(e),
the
seller
does
--
does
not
--
given
the
defense
of
so-called
cost
justification.
the
court
below
was
unanimous
in
affirming
the
finding
as
to
competition.
a
majority
held
that
the
clause
in
section
2
(a)
prohibiting
price
discrimination,
which
limits
the
prohibition
to
price
differentials
which
happened
in
jury's
effect
on
competition,
may
not
be
read
into
2
(e)
which
is
an
outright
prohibition.
a
differently
constituted
majority
held
that
section
2
(b),
which
i
will
come
to
later,
permits
justification
did
not
attack
to
state
just
what
the
--
how
broad
their
justification
was,
but
justification
over
and
above
any
defense
given
by
the
statute
itself,
apart
from
2
(b),
but
that
at
least
that
that
--
that
justification
included
so-called,
cost
justification.
now,
we
take
issue
with
the
court's
ruling
as
to
the
effect
of
section
2
(b).
simplicity
challenges
the
finding
as
to
competition.
it
also
urges
that
under
section
2
(b),
it
is
entitled
to
show,
by
rebuttal
evidence,
absence
of
competitive
injury.
a
question
of
competition
is
preliminary
to
the
other
questions
and
i
hope
to
discuss
it
first.
the
actual
wording
of
2
(e)
does
not
confine
the
prohibition
to
purchasers
who
compete
with
each
other
in
resale
of
the
seller's
product.
however,
this
has
been
the
--
at
least,
inferentially,
the
commission's
interpretation
of
that
section
and
we're
prepared
to
have
at
court,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
assume
that
section
2
(e)
applies
only
if
the
purchasers
resell
the
same
product
in
the
common
market.
the
facts
here
show,
we
think,
ordinary
common
garden-variety
type
of
competition
where
two
stores
--
two
types
of
stores
selling
the
same
thing
in
the
same
cities
and
shopping
areas,
sometimes
in
the
same
city
block.
now,
they
weren't
rendered
noncompetitive
because
of
different
motivations
for
selling
patterns.
the
ten
cent
stores
sold
patterns
to
make
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
patterns
and
they
would
not
sell
them,
if
they
were
not
independently
profitable.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
fabric
stores
sold
them
primarily
to
aid
in
there
fabric
sales.
but
they're
both
soliciting
trade
in
the
same
group
of
public.
they
both
have
the
purpose
of
capturing
as
many
pattern
customers
as
possible.
ten
cent
store
wanted
to
do
this
to
make
as
much
money
as
possible
in
its
pattern
sales.
the
fabric
store
wanted
to
do
this,
because
sale
of
a
pattern
in
its
own
store
was
likely
to
lead
to
the
purchaser
trading
to
its
adjoining
fabric
department
and
the
buying
unnecessary
material
there.
also,
the
larger
the
sales
of
patterns,
the
easier
it
was
to
absorb
the
cost
of
such
things
as
catalogues
and
cabinets.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
most
of
them
said
that
they
regarded
it
as
unprofitable.
now,
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
was
--
the
testimony
along
that
line
was
all
very
general
and
rather
vague
in
the
note.
cost
figures
were
put
in,
but
they
were
--
they
would
be
asked
a
question
in
cross-examination
whether
they
consider
this
a
profitable
business
and
most
of
them
said,
“no.”
they
hoped
it
might
become
to
such,
but
that
is
--
as
it
has
then
being
conducted,
it
wasn't.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
suppose
you
--
i
suppose
if
you
--
if
it
was
just
a
gift
of
business,
then
--
then
it
wouldn't
be.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
the
--
they
wanted
to
--
well,
perhaps
i
--
perhaps
i
was
a
little
too
hasty
to
say
if
that
--
that
--
if
they
gave
them
away,
they
would
not
be
in
competition.
they
would
--
of
course,
they
would
--
there
wouldn't
be
the
usual
question
of
comparison
of
cost
and
--
and
discriminatory
treatment,
if
--
if
the
person
was
just
giving
away
the
ultimate
product
rather
than
selling
it.
here,
there
was
no
question
that
they
were
selling
it.
they
were
selling
it
at
a
price.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
true.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
this
as
i
said,
the
price
was
stamped
on
the
pattern
and
the
testimony
was
that
there
has
been
no
price
cutting
in
the
field.
but
the
facts
that
price
was
the
same,
doesn't
mean
it
was
not
an
absence
of
competition.
if
that
were
the
case,
you
never
have
competition
wherein
the
state
having
fair
trade
law
and
articles
that
are
subject
to
fair
trade
contracts
so
that
the
same
price
by
requirement
of
the
law,
they
obviously
would
be
in
competition.
it
might
be
--
it
might
affect
the
same
--
of
all
the
same
elements
of
--
of
competition
that
you'd
have
otherwise.
they
would
be
seeking
to
get
as
many
customers
as
possible
in
either
case.
now,
simplicity
makes
a
rather
complicated
contention
which
is
based
on
a
ruling
that
the
commission
made
in
pursuing
on
the
trade
commission
act
charged
and
this
ruling
was
that
the
evidence
failed
to
show
affirmatively
that
the
discrimination
injured
the
fabric
stores.
now,
simplicity
argues
that
since
the
discriminations
here
were
conceded
to
be
equivalent
to
more
than
the
25%
price
differential
and
since
in
the
morton
salt
case
in
334
u.s.,
this
court
said
that,
"a
smaller
price
differential
did
not
obviously
--
adversely
affected
competition.
the
ruling
as
to
absence
of
proof,
as
to
competitive
injury
and
defining
the
competition,
could
not
be
squared
with
each
other.
our
brief
in
447
points
out
that
it's
highly
doubtful
whether
the
commission
applied
the
test
and
principles
which
--
which
in
the
morton
salt
case
were
held
to
be
determinative
of
the
question
of
competitive
injury
under
section
2
(a)'s
effect
on
competition
clause.
error
by
the
commission,
if
there
was
error
in
its
ruling
on
the
collateral
charge,
cannot
invalidate
the
finding
of
competition
which
is
made
in
connection
with
the
clayton
act
charge.
in
addition,
the
validity
of
that
finding
depends
on
the
evidence
which
supports
it,
whether
it's
adequate.
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence.
two
ten
cent
store
witnesses
testified
without
reservation
that
those
stores
and
the
fabric
stores
were
in
competition
in
the
sale
of
fabric
--
in
the
sale
of
patterns.
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
finding
was
unanimously
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
under
accepted
principles,
this
administrative
finding
should
not
be
reversed
unless
there
is
a
convincing
showing
of
clear
error.i
--
i
submit
that
simplicity's
challenge
does
not
even
adumbrate
error.
now,
the
other
questions
are
whether,
when
all
the
elements
of
the
2
(e)
violation
have
been
established,
section
2
(b)
permits
the
defense
of
cost
justification
or
the
defense
of
the
absence
competitive
injury.
these
questions
turned
on
the
meaning
and
effect
of
2
(b),
but
possibly
the
other
provisions
of
subsections
of
section
2,
maybe
relevant
to
some
extent
and
i
will
briefly
indicate
what
these
sections
are.
there
are
five
prohibitory
sections,
but
2
(f)
is
tied
to
2
(a)
and
i
think
we
can
regard
in
--
sections
as
limited
to
four
sections
of
this
type.
2
(c),
2
(d)
and
2
(e)
constitute
each
a
specific
prohibition
of
a
specific
practice,
each
is
without
a
proviso.
each
is
without
any
qualifying
clause.
they,
therefore,
stand
in
contrast
with
2
(a),
prohibiting
price
discrimination.
it
has
three
provisos.
one
of
them
is
--
one
proviso
is
subject
to
another
proviso.
it
has
the
clause
limiting
the
prohibition
to
differentials
which
adversely
affect
competition.
the
most
important
proviso
is
the
one
that
exempts
differentials
which
make
only
due
allowance
for
differences
in
the
seller's
cost,
due
to
resulting
from
different
methods
of
delivery
or
quantity
sold.
now,
i'll
just
state
what
2
(c),
2
(d)
and
2
(e)
do.
2
(c)
prohibits
payment
of
brokerage
to
the
other
party
to
a
sales
transaction.
2
(d)
makes
it
unlawful
to
pay
a
purchaser
for
furnished
--
for
services
or
facilities
which
he
has
furnished
in
connection
with
sale
of
the
seller's
product
without
making
a
proportionally
equal
payment
available
to
other
competing
purchasers.
it's
very
close
to
2
(e)
and
2
(e)
prohibits
furnishing
services
or
facilities
to
one
purchaser
not
accorded
and
proportionally
equal
terms
to
all.
now,
the
commission
and
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
the
effect
clause
of
2
(a)
may
not
be
read
into
2
(c),
2
(d)
or
2
(e),
which
as
i
said
are
outright
prohibitions.
the
courts
of
appeals
in
four
different
circuits
have
held
that
the
effect
clause
may
not
be
read
into
2
(c).
in
two
circuits,
it
has
been
held
that
this
clause
may
not
be
read
into
2
(e),
the
one
here
involved.
it's
also
been
held
that
the
cost-saving
proviso
of
2
(a)
may
not
be
read
into
2
(c).
and
none
of
these
cases
was
there
a
dissent
on
these
points.
actually,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
simplicity
states,
concedes,
or
disclaims
any
contention
that
either
the
cost
saving
proviso
or
the
effect
clause
of
2
(a)
is
to
be
read
into
2
(e),
it
rests
this
case
solely
on
2
(b).
now,
that
consists
of
what
i'll
call
a
procedural
provision
and
a
proviso.
the
proviso
as
the
court
knows
is
that
it
permits
its
seller
to
show
that
his
lower
cost
or
the
services
or
facilities
which
he
furnished
were
made
in
good
faith
to
meet
the
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor
at
the
services
or
facilities
furnished
by
the
factory.
simplicity
doesn't
act
--
claim
to
be
within
this
proviso,
but
rest
solely
on
the
initial
part
of
2
(b).
now,
i
would
like
to
read
that
initial
part.
it's
--
the
court
will
find
it
in
page
26
of
our
brief
in
406,
"upon
proof
being
made
at
any
hearing
on
a
complaint
under
this
section,
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
price
or
services
or
facilities
furnished,
the
burden
of
rebutting,
the
prima
facie
case
thus
may
shall
--
but
in
showing
justification,
shall
be
upon
the
person
charged
with
a
violation
of
this
section.
and
unless
justification
shall
be
affirmatively
shown,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
issue
an
order
terminating
the
discrimination."
on
this
--
on
their
face,
these
words
are
simply
declaratory
that
party
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
has
any
exception
from
the
general
prohibition
of
2
(a)
or
2
(e).
these
exceptions
are
granted
by
the
provisos
to
2
(a).
they
are
granted
by
the
proviso
of
2
(b),
which
applies
to
both
2
(a)
and
2
(e).
simplicity
reads
the
words
showing
justification
as
broader
and
is
authorizing
substantive
defenses
which
are
not
otherwise
authorized
for
section
2.
if
such
additional
defenses
are
granted,
they
are
obviously,
holy
undefined.sections
2
(c),
2
(d)
and
2
(e),
instead
of
being
outright
prohibitions,
there's
something
quite
different.
they
are
open
to
any
defense
which
a
reviewing
court
and
the
commission
may
consider
to
be
just
and
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case.
that's
practically
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
at
338.
and
2
(a)'s
provisos
do
not
set
the
limits
of
the
defences
given
to
price
discrimination.
there
are
these
unknown
and
unknowable
additional
defenses
available
under
2
(b).
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
i
--
it
said
that
if
you
could
do
not
just
adopt
2
(a)'s
criteria.
you'll
find
that
the
top
--
near
the
top
of
338,
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph
at
the
top
of
that
page,
"we
do
not
agree
with
petitioner
that
such
justification
reaches
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
to
import
2
(a)
criteria
as
matters
of
defense
in
section
2
(e)
charge."
and
then,
near
the
bottom
--
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
"congress,
we
think,
must've
intended
that
justification
to
be
shown
under
the
first
clause
of
2
(b)
asked
with
2
(e)
charge
of
discrimination
in
facilities
furnished
was
to
depend
upon
the
facts
in
a
particular
case."
as
broad
as
that,
as
i
read
it,
in
--
in
morton
salt,
this
court
construed
section
2
(b)
as
this
--
according
to
what's
court
said
pointed
out
that,
"the
general
rule
with
a
statutory
construction
was
that
when
a
statute
contains
an
exceptionary
exemption
from
the
general
prohibition,
the
party
who
claims
the
benefit
as
the
exception,
has
the
burden
of
proof."
it
said
that,
"2
(b)
specifically
imposes
that
burden
on
that
party
charged
with
violation."
his
construction
was
reaffirmed
in
the
automatic
canteen
case
in
346
u.s.
now
the
court
there
said
that
"2
(b),
apart
from
the
proviso,
attempts
to
lay
down
the
rules
of
evidence
under
the
act."
and
it
said,
"as
references
to
2
(b)
or
to
the
procedural
language
preceding
the
proviso,
legislative
history
confirms
and
requires
the
construction
that
2
(b),
apart
from
its
proviso,
does
not
--
is
procedural
and
not
substantive."
the
section,
as
it
now
reads,
was
in
the
builder's
reported
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
except
that
at
that
time,
it
applied
only
to
price
discrimination.
the
committee
filed
a
17-page
report
which
discussed
at
some
length
every
provisions
of
the
bill.
all
of
it
said
about
this
initial
part
of
2
(b)
was,
"that
it
merely
lays
down
directions
with
reference
to
procedure
including
a
statement
with
respect
to
burden
of
proof."
i
submit
that
this
statement
is
irreconcilable
with
simplicity's
construction
of
2
(b)
as
creating,
authorizing
substantive
defences.
the
committee
unequivocally
said
that
it
was
procedural
loan.
several
pages
of
the
report
were
devoted
to
an
analysis
of
the
provisos
of
2
(a)
and
i
may
say
that
the
report
was
issued
after
extensive
public
hearings.
if
in
addition
to
the
defences
given
by
this
provisos,
2
(b)
gives
other
defences
of
unknown
and
unknowable
scope,
the
committee's
detailed
discussion
of
the
provisos
was
an
exercise
in
futility.
also,
with
statement
that
the
--
this
part
of
a
section
was
procedural
only,
was
simplicity's
construction
is
right,
as
i
submit,
practically
attract
to
congress.
now,
the
circumstances
under
which
2
(b)
was
extended
to
discrimination
in
furnishing
services
or
facilities
are
also
irreconcilable
with
simplicity's
construction.
in
the
fourth
congress
for
the
house
was
committee
amendment
to
extend
both
parts
of
2
(b)
to
furnishing
services
or
facilities.
the
significant
thing
about
this
action
is
that
the
only
thing
that
was
mentioned,
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
was
that
the
proviso
was
being
extended
to
this
kind
of
discrimination.
the
extension
--
the
procedural
provisions
to
the
--
to
this
discrimination
was
so
unimportant,
it
was
not
even
mentioned.
it
was
naturally
appropriate
to
extend
the
procedural
provision
when
the
proviso
was
extended
because
with
the
change
in
the
proviso,
a
defense
was
created
to
2
(e).
that
senate
action
on
2
(b)
gives
no
clue
as
to
its
meaning.
originally,
senator
robinson
and
representative
patman
introduced
identical
bills.
neither
of
these
bills
contained
2
(b)
or
any
counterpart
of
it.
this
was
also
true
that
the
bill
was
reported
out
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
shortly
before
the
bill
was
passed
by
the
senate,
senator
moore,
of
new
jersey,
offered
an
amendment
adding
a
new
subsection
which
is
the
same
as
the
present
2
(d).
he
stated
that
he
was
offering
this
amendment
at
the
request
of
people
have
telephoned
me
today.
senator
robinson
then
said
that
he
had
not
previously
seen
the
amendment
that
he
was
in
doubt
about
one
aspect
of
it,
but
that
he
saw
no
objection
to
its
being
incorporated
in
the
bill
so
that
the
conferees
may
consider
it
along
with
two
other
amendments
which
had
been
adopted
earlier
that
day.
therefore,
section
2
(b)
came
into
the
senate
bill
without
any
prior
committee
consideration
or
consideration
by
senator
robinson,
without
any
explanation
as
to
its
meaning
or
effect
by
the
senator
who
offered
it
and
was
accepted
simply
on
the
basis
of
throwing
it
into
the
part
were
later
consideration
of
conflicts.
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
cited
by
simplicity
does
not
even
inferentially
support
the
construction
of
2
(b)
as
creating
substantive
defences.
it
cites
general
statements
as
to
the
objective
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
none
of
them
referred
as
section
2
(b),
even
indirectly
and
the
statements
are
in
themselves,
completely
inconclusive.
it
points
to
a
statement
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
the
act
was
not
intended
to
prevent
the
economy's
incident
to
mass
buying
or
the
passing
on
such
cost
saving
of
the
seller
--
at
the
seller's
customers.
simplicity
asked
why
cost
saving
should
not
be
a
defense
to
discrimination
in
furnishing
services
and
facilities
when
it
is
a
defense
to
price
discrimination.
i
think
the
answer,
in
part,
is
that
price
is
an
element
of
every
sale.
the
various
provisos
of
2
(a)
provide
necessary
flexibility
in
dealing
--
isn't
applying
the
section
to
the
merit
situations
which
involved
price
or
pricing
practices,
giving
a
purchaser
furnishing
to
in
services
their
facilities
is
relatively
rare.
specialized
circumstances
in
which
this
is
done,
there
is
sufficient
latitude
provided
by
the
limitation
to
limiting
the
prohibition
to
situations
where
the
furnishing
of
services
is
not
done
on
proportion
in
equal
terms
to
all
effected
purchasers.
simplicity
also
contends
that
the
economic
effect
of
a
price
discrimination
and
discrimination
in
furnishing
services
and
facilities
is
the
same
substance.
and
that
therefore
cost
saving
should
be
deemed
the
defense
in
both
cases.
but
if
furnishing
services
and
facilities
is
tantamount
to
a
price
differential,
the
seller,
if
he
has
real
occasion
to
furnish
services
and
facilities,
can
give
them
on
the
same
term
so
our
purchasers
and
give
those
to
--
for
whom
is
cost
through
a
lower
--
a
lower
price.
then
he
has
available
to
him
all
the
defenses
of
section
2
(a).
there
is
another
consideration
in
this
connection.
a
price
differential
which
is
usually
in
the
form
of
graduated
quantity
discounts
is
much
more
easily
measurable
against
this
saving
in
the
seller's
cost
than
is
inequality
in
furnishing
services
or
facilities.
a
difference
in
price
is
the
difference
in
the
specific
amount.
difference
in
services
and
facilities
has
--
involves
first
determining
what
is
the
dollar
value
or
amount
of
that
difference
and
a
query
whether
that
value
is
cost
to
the
seller
or
a
value
that
the
purchaser
made
and
quite
different
then,
when
you
got
that,
you
have
to
relate
it
in
some
way
to
unit
sales.
these
are
in
quagmires
of
uncertainty
and
they
avoided,
if
the
statute
is
read
according
to
its
terms.
that
is
his
granting
cost
saving
as
a
defense
only
in
the
case
of
price
discrimination.
it
is
also
much
simpler
to
determine
the
effect
on
competition
of
a
price
difference
of
a
specific
amount
than
where
it
involves
difference
in
service
and
facilities
to
some
purchasers
and
others.
congress
may
well
have
concluded
that
its
objectives
would
be
better
served
by
making
that
kind
of
discrimination
in
outright
prohibition.
this
would
be
merely
to
recognize
that
normally
and
almost
inevitably,
this
involves
adverse
competitive
effect.
that
it
certainly
tends
to
adversely
effect
competition
and
would
eliminate
from
the
proceeding
the
difficulty,
time
consuming
factor
of
proof
and
counter
proof
as
to
a
competitive
effect.
now,
i
agree,
there
maybe
reasonable
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
this
was
sound
policy
to
make
this
an
outright
prohibition.
but
that
as
to
the
wisdom
of
what
congress
has
done
does
not
justify
recasting
statutory
provisions
which
are
plain
and
unambiguous.
as
i
submit,
these
are
both
on
their
face
and
as
shown
by
legislative
history.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
justification
is
any
defense
which
the
statute
outside
that
provision
creates
or
authorizes.
for
example,
a
cost
justification
which
was
what
was
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
which
was
under
(a)
and
each
one
of
the
provisos
of
(a)
would
be
of
that
character.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
each
one
begins
--
each
one
of
these
things
--
it
shall
be
unlawful
and
as
i
said,
the
courts
had
been
absolutely
uniform.
there's
been
no
deviation
in
holding
that
those
provisos
and
the
effect
clause
of
2
(a)
may
not
be
read
into
those
prohibitory
later
sections.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
my
answer
is
that
the
statement
is
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
statement
that
you
just
quoted
from.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
first
part.
the
2
--
it
was
held
in
morton
salt
as
to
the
cost
justification
provides
over
2
(a)
that
was
governed
by
the
2
(b)
proviso
and
that
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent
in
that
case
and
not
on
the
commission.
that
was
specifically
held
there
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
in
any
event,
i
think
you'll
find
that's
specifically
held
in
morton
salt.
but
i
just
said
that
the
burden
was
on
the
party
who
set
up
cost
justification
and
not
with
--
with
not
a
part
of
the
condition's
case.
in
fact,
both
parties
conceded
that
that
was
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
law
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
was
a
general
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
general
proposition.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
you
read
that
in
the
light
of
2
(b)
in
--
and
but
congress
said
in
2
(b).
in
other
words,
the
provisos
were
exceptions
from
a
general
prohibition.
2
(b)
stated
what
is
the
general
rule
of
law
where
there
is
an
exception
from
the
general
clause.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
don't
see
any
real
problem.
there
are
certain
provisos
in
2
(a)
and
then
there's
a
general
provision
in
2
(b)
as
to
burden
of
proof
where
there
is
a
defense
given
by
virtue
of
a
proviso.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
don't
know
which
it
means
by
stated
in
those
terms.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
it's
--
it's
just
says
--
a
--
a
proviso,
it
says
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
provided
that
so
and
so
and
so
and
so.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
turn
--
if
you
turn
to
page
25
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
all
right.
here
is
the
first
one,
“provided
that
nothing
here
in
contain
shall
prevent
differentials
which
make
only
due
allowance
for
differences
in
the
cost
to
manufacture,
sale
or
delivery
resulting
from
the
differing
methods
or
quantities,
and
so
on.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
it
shall
be
unlawful.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
there
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
say
that
2
(b)
clarifies
what
would
be
ordinarily
the
rule
of
law
if
2
(b)
was
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
2
(b)
is
general.
and
--
and
that
is
if
it
applies
to
2
(a)
and
2
(e)
in
that
sense
as
general.
it
--
it
states
what
the
rule
of
law
is
as
to
burden
of
proof
where
there
is
a
defense
created
or
an
exception
created
to
one
of
the
prohibitions.
in
this
case,
we're
not
talking
about
2
(a).
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
not.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
cost
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
said
in
proviso
is
limited
to
2
(a)
and
where
it
says
that
the
burden
of
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case
does
made
by
showing
justification
means
any
justification
given
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
now,
that
justification
is
given
as
to
section
2
(a)
by
its
provisos.
it
is
given
by
the
2
(b)
proviso
as
to
2
(a)
and
as
to
2
(e).
and
that's
the
reason,
i
think,
it
is
very
significant.
the
--
let
me
repeat,
that
as
this
bill
came
out
of
the
house
as
was
reported
by
the
committee,
it
applied
only
to
price
discrimination
and
when
by
a
committee
amendment
is
extended
to
2
(e),
the
only
aspect
of
the
extension
that
was
even
mentioned
was
that
they
were
bringing
2
(e)
within
this
meeting
competition
proviso.
now,
when
that
defense
was
created
to
2
(e)
which
didn't
exist
before,
then
it
was
a
normal
and
natural
thing
to
likewise
extend
the
initial
procedural
part
to
2
(e).
it
was
--
that
part
of
it
that
was
largely
pro
forma.
i
think
2
(b)
would
have
had
the
same
effect
if
they
haven't
made
that
extension.
but
certainly,
the
pro
forma
extension
didn't
create
or
make
any
fundamental
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
section.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
certainly,
insofar
as
justification
is
given
by
section
2.
now,
it
is
given
by
section
2
by
the
2
(b)
proviso.
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
you
go
to
the
various
provisos
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
of
section
2,
yes,
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
they're
--
they're
written
in.
there
are
no
provisos
except
in
2
(a),
apart
from
this
proviso
that
is
incorporated
indeed
and
that
is
made
applicable
to
2
(a)
and
2
(e),
but
there
is
no
proviso,
for
example,
as
to
2
(c).
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it's
the
initial
part
that
is
redundant
as
far
as
services
and
facilities
furnished
is
concerned.
in
other
words
--
as
--
as
i've
said
before,
when
they
made
--
when
they
extended
2
(b)
to
2
(e),
the
only
thing
that
was
mentioned
in
congress
was
the
change
in
the
proviso.
the
other
thing
was
considered
nearly
pro
forma
now.
