justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
it
not
say
that
upon
proof
being
made
any
hearing
of
the
complaint
under
this
section
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
price
or
services
or
facilities
furnished
the
burden
of
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case
of
the
government
shall
be
upon
the
person
charged?
now,
then,
doesn't
that
say
that
this
defense
shall
be
used
against
available
under
a
charge
brought
under
subdivision
(e)
which
is
necessarily
one
that
relates
to

though,
as
i
read
it,
does
not
make
any
specific
mention
of
services
or

justice
charles

(b)
however
says
that
upon
proof
being
made
at
any
hearing
under
this
section,
and
of
course,
these
are
--
subsections
were
all
part
of
the
section,
that
there
has
been
a
discrimination
in
price
or
services
or
facilities
furnished
the
burden
of
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case
of
the
government
shall
be
on
the
person
charged.
now,
how
do
you
explain
that
language
if
otherwise
then
as
to
permit
the
defense
of
justification
on
the
part
of
the
person
charged
in
the
dewey
case?
