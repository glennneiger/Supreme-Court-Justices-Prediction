do
you

in
those

for
all
that
those
recitals
are
inconsistent
with
less
than
30-day
periods.

justice
charles

do
you
argue
that
use
for
residential
purposes
for
a
period
shorter
than
30
days
is
not
residential
use?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
conjunction
with
the
questions
or
series
of
questions
propounded
to
you
by
the
chief
justice,
would
you
give
us
your
view
of
the
meaning
of
subsection
(c)
set
forth
at
pages
48
and
49
in
your
brief,
saying
that
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
act."
this
is
1954
act
now,
"no
mortgage
with
respect
to
multifamily
housing
shall
be
insured
under
this
act,
(except
pursuant
to
a
commitment
to
ensure
issued
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
housing
act
of
1954)."
and
skipping
the
parenthesis
now,
"no
mortgage
with
respect
to
multifamily
housing
shall
be
issued
for
an
additional
term
unless
the
mortgagee
--
mortgagor
certifies
that
while
the
insurance
remains
effective,
he
will
not
rent
or
permit
the
rental
of
the
housing
or
any
part
thereof
for
a
transient
or
hotel
purpose,
is
that
not
inconsistent
with
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
the
difference,
mr.
rosenthal,
that
in
the
lease
of
real
property
for
returns,
does
not
the
landlord
give
to
the
lessee
the
right
to
make
any
use
of
the
property
except
as
restricted
by
the
governance
of
the
lease?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
but
--
but
darlington
did
own
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
long,
i
thought
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
the
judge
of
the
trial
court
found
in
your
argument
that
without
these
rentals
that
you
fixed
up
that
you
wouldn't
otherwise
get
too
many
while
you
could
make
payments
of
interest
and
amortization
on
the
mortgage.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
default
would
occur,
foreclosure
would
result.
your
$400,000
would
be
gone.
the
government
has
the
property
as
what
it
--
is
--
as
it
found
to
one
note
which
it
insured,
isn't
that
right?
