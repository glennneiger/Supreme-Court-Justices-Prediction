aren't
you
going
to
argue
the
construction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
not
going
to
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
construction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
exactly
bars
such
a
construction
before
you
ever
reach
the
constitutional
question
or
added
thereto
that
since
there
maybe
a
non-frivolous
and
serious
constitutional
question,
it
ought
to
be
construed
the
way
you
contend
it.
aren't
you
going
to
argue
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
was
just
wondering
because
you
started
off
a
simple
question
with
constitutionality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
you
follow
your
own
course
of
argument,
but
i
just
wanted
you
to
--
wanted
to
know
whether
you
give
up
the
construction
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
--
it
does
shed
some
light
on
an
earlier
act,
if
congress
in
the
later
act
thinks
it
has
to
do
something
which
would
be
needless
if
it
hadn't
been
accomplished
by
the
earlier
act.
it
shed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
nothing
do
with
technical
law,
but
it
has
to
do
with
good
commonsense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
long
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
you
say
for
two
nights,
he
might
rent
part
of
these
things
for
one
night,
yes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this.
does
the
phrase
operation
of
a
rental
housing
project
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
english,
let's
forget
our
specialized
thing
in
the
law,
operation
of
a
rental
housing.
is
that
a
phrase
that
one
would
use
for
overnight
guests?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
one
night,
i
thought
you
agreed
it
could
be
for
one
night
rather
than
two,
that's
what
i
mean
by
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
does
that
phrase
cover
that
kind
of
occupancy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
that
they
could
set
apart,
set
apart
not
for
the
kind
a
mother-in-law
visiting
a
young
couple,
but
set
apart
a
fraction,
a
reasonable
fraction
of
the
total
available
apartment
for
transient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
let
me
put
another
question,
mr.
long.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
if
this
were
the
letting
overnight
or
for
two
nights
of
a
transient
couple
or
a
transient
person,
one
apartment
or
two.
for
myself,
i
would
dismiss
that
as
de
minimis.
that's
really
not
to
be
taken
into
account.
but
this
was
a
practice,
wasn't
it?
this
was
a
systematic
letting
of
available
apartments
to
transients
of
the
part
of
the
carrying
on
of
the
business.so,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
--
i
will
wait
the
government's
reply
to
what
you've
just
said.
for
me
it
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
if
what
you
--
if
what
you've
just
said
presents
--
is
the
problem
in
this
case,
rather
than
a
practice,
a
business
practice
of
utilizing
part
of
the
available
apartments
for
transient
uses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i'll
do
what
he
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
have
to,
if
i
may
break
in
or
add
to
justice
black's
question.
i
think
you
answered
this
question,
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
restore
to
the
government
the
records
you
received
for
less
than
30
day
rentals,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
is
merely
a
question
of
whether
you
can
continue
to
do
this
in
the
future.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
black,
you
lose
--
what
is
it?$40,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it,
you
don't
need
to
lose
that
which
you
would
be
disabled
from
renting
less
than
for
30
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
future,
in
the
future,
you
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
again.
would
you
have
to
restore
any
cash
that
you
have
gotten
up
to
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
all
--
this
is
all
in
futural,
this
is
all
for
the
future.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
forecast
of
the
income
that
you
would
lose
if
you
couldn't
rent
for
less
than
30
days,
the
access
--
the
excess
apartment.
that's
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
ask
you
what
the
chief
justice
has
commissioned,
one
question.
when
an
apartment
was
rented
to
a
transient
as
my
brother
harlan
said,
these
ad
hoc
rentals,
whether
such
an
ad
hoc
rental
was
made.
was
the
furniture
brought
in
for
the
transient
guest
or
there
are
always
apartments
which
had
long
furniture
to
await
the
transient
customer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
well,
then
those
60
odd
apartments
that
were
furnished
by
long
furniture
always
set
aside
in
expectation
of
a
transient
flow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
suppose
a
--
suppose
a
veteran
came
in,
would
he
--
would
he
take
one
of
these
furnished
apartments
for
six
months
or
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
basis
was
60
apartments
out
of
the
total,
whatever
they
were,
furnished
as
against
the
others
that
were
not
furnished?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
would
--
that
furniture
would
be
available
to
the
yearly
tenants
as
well
as
to
the
20-day
tenant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
question,
it
wasn't
a
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
tell
us
--
that
doesn't
give
you
the
quantitative
light.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
has
the
practice
you
complain
of
been
going
on
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
think
it
is
still
going
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
nothing
in
the
record
which
fairs
on
the
determination
of
this
fact?
that
was
my
question
to
you
in
the
light
of
what
this
--
the
long
said,
namely
that
rentals
to
transients
was
not
a
device
to
make
extra
money,
although
they
could
have
rented
for
--
beyond
30
months,
but
that
was
a
necessity
as
a
matter
of
experience.
some
of
these
apartments
would
have
stood
empty
and
this
was
a
way
of
utilizing
the
excess
available
apartment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
mr.
long
said
if
i
understood
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
you
know
that
--
how
long
--
when
--
how
soon
after
apartments
were
available,
did
they
rent
it
to
the
--
the
transients?
justice
felix
frankfurter
july
to
february.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
the
other
side,
i
know
little
about
these
things,
but
very
often
before
an
apartment
house
is
under
way,
inquiries
are
made
about
future
rentals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
rosenthal.
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
if
this
was
an
isolated
case,
this
just
as
darlington
company
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
down
there
--
let
me
put
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
think
this
was
--
the
case
was
fit
to
be
here.
and
therefore,
the
only
problem
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
is
the
construction
of
a
statute
or
the
implied
powers
of
the
fha.
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
does
the
fha,
insofar
as
you
are
able
to
speak
for
it
and
you
ought
to
be
able
to
speak
for
it,
contend
that
if
as
a
matter
of
honest
business
judgment,
an
apartment
house
is
practically
not
rentable
and
that
there
is
some
excess
apartment
that
the
owners
or
the
mortgagor
may
rent
that
excess,
shown
by
past
business
experience
or
allowable
judgment,
to
transients.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
your
apartment
houses
mortgaged
prior
to
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
leave
those
vacant
and
not
to
make
(inaudible)
to
which
you
may
put
its
rent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
leave
them
vacant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
--
i'm
trying
to
enlarge
this
problem
away
from
the
darlington
to
a
general
proposition
if
that's
the
law
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
as
a
matter
of
explicit
congressional
language,
but
the
implication
from
the
general
policy
underlying
it,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
really
suggesting,
this
is
a
device
to
submerge
a
purpose
of
their
houses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
enquiries
that
justice
black
made
have
--
seems
to
me
very
important.
but
as
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
1946
act
impliedly
without
all
the
resorts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
that
this
doesn't
make
a
change,
in
--
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
if
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
housing
act,
why
should
the
housing
act
go
in
for
supporting
resort
--
resort
communities
instead
of
communities
by
which
--
which
reference
common
law's
housing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
or
didn't
it
make
a
change
as
to
resorts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
is,
why
should
an
inapplicable
situation
with
reference
to
the
purpose
of
the
housing
act
to
which
resorts,
the
taking
out
of
the
statute
or
had
been
in
the
statute
to
begin
with.congress
wasn't
concerned
with
fly-by-night
florida
visitors,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
it
took
them
out.
and
since
before
that,
and
you
said
that,
that
implied
that
it
was
always
in
there
as
to
every
other
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
would
--
it
would
get
nonsense
to
congress
if
you
can
help
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
an
easterner
say
that
southern
california
is
--
is
repeatable
in
those
areas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
put
in
--
did
the
fha
put
in
evidence?
did
the
fha
introduce
evidence
before
either
judge
hoffman
originally
or
when
it
came
back
to
the
three-judge
court
on
--
i
know
the
veteran
if
it's
so
because
they
just
acted
under
judge
hoffman
record.
that's
how
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
--
did
the
government
introduce
any
evidence
under
that?
