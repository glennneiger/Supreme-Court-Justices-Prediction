number
13,
federal
housing
administration,
appellant,
versus
the
darlington
incorporated.before
the
argument
in
this
case
i
make
the
announcement
that
the
orders
of
the
court
appear
upon
the
list
certified
by
the
chief
justice
and
filed
with
the
clerk
and
will
not
be
orally
announced.
now,
mr.
rosenthal,
you
may
proceed
in
number
13.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
before
you
get
to
that,
how
about
those
instances
where
the
fha
did
permit
them
to
do
that.
are
they
still
operating
in
that
manner,
or
were
they
enjoined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
specifically
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
could
--
how
could
that
logically
follow
if
congress
had
always
intended
that
it
should
be
--
should
not
be
used
for
transient
rooms.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
if
the
statute
--
if
the
statute
prohibited
the
fha
from
doing
it
in
the
first
instance,
how
could
a
later
statute
say
that
they
were
all
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
your
position
that
if
--
if
the
fha
had
given
permission
to
darlington
before
the
1954
statute,
you
could
not
enjoin
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
this
--
what
you've
been
telling
us
is
all
--
is
not
legislative
history
but
it's
--
it's
post
history
if
one
might
call
it
that.
what
is
there
in
the
act
that
shows
affirmatively
that
they
have
no
power
to
do
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
limitation
at
all
on
--
on
the
--
like
the
time
that
--
that
these
should
be
occupied,
these
apartments
of
veterans.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
it
to
indicate
that
what
the
minimum
might
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
is
this.
if
congress
intended
that
there
should
be
no
transient
tenancies,
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
on
the
contracts?
why
wouldn't
the
fha
have
put
that
in
some
of
these
contrast.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
rosenthal,
it
--
the
thing
that
seems
a
little
strange
to
me
is
this,
within
a
program
that
is
going
to
involve
$3
billion,
that
the
--
neither
the
reports
of
the
committees
nor
the
speeches
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill
on
the
floor
would
show
affirmatively
what
type
of
tenancy
this
--
this
is,
you
would
think
that
somebody,
some
place
along
the
line
would
say,
"we
are
not
competing
--
going
to
compete
with
hotels,
we're
--
we're
not
going
to
do
this
or
that.
we're
going
to
--
this
is
for
longer
term
tenancies."
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
yes.
i
can
understand
--
i
could
point
that,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
wasn't
a
prohibition
of
it,
wouldn't
there
be
a
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
practicum
in
this
case
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
we
have
a
suit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
this
suit
was
started
did
the
others
stop
or
continued
to
--
to
use
them
for
places
for
transient
rentals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
the
other
ones
that
you
say
were
not
enjoined.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
rather
important
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
apartment
houses
would
you
say
would
be
affected
by
this
decision?
is
it
a
great
number?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
be
interesting
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
is
--
we'd
like
to
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
may
have
three
minutes
afterward
to
sum
up
--
we've
taken
out
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
long.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
long
--
mr.
long,
if
we
--
if
we
decide
in
your
favor,
does
this
mean
that
every
apartment
house
that
was
built
under
this
program
prior
to
the
1954
act
can
now
lease
any
or
all
of
its
apartments
on
a
transient
basis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
long,
in
addition
to
what
you
have
said
darlington
did,
didn't
they
go
out
and
furnish
up
a
large
number
of
these
apartments
for
the
--
for
the
sole
purpose
of
--
of
renting
them
in
a
--
in
a
different
manner
than
the
--
than
the
vast
majority
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenthal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
include
all
of
those
who
were
--
who
were
permitted
prior
to
the
1954
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
were
in
--
had
a
contract
to
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
excluding
those,
are
all
of
the
others
treated
the
same
as
this
--
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
if
you
will
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no.
please,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
that
connect,
mr.
rosenthal,
what
--
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
the
--
the
point
mr.
long
raised
about
this
second
exception
in
the
1954
act
where
the
project
is
located
in
an
area
which
the
commissioner
determines
to
be
a
resort
area
plus
the
response
of
the
sponsor
of
the
--
the
bill
that
that
would
include
the
entire
state
of
florida
with
about
11,000
projects
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
my
point
is
this,
when
you
--
you
use
this,
1954
act
to
establish
legislative
intent
to
apply
this
original
act,
only
to
long-term
tenancies.
now,
how
does
this
establish
any
such
thing
if
they
eliminate
an
entire
state
that
has
1100
projects
in
it.
how
does
that
establish
the
fact
ten
years
before
they
intended
for
the
entire
nation
to
be
under
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
there
any
such
thing
in
the
prior
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
there
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
why
they
exempted
the
resort
areas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
in
the
entire
state
of
florida,
people
don't
establish
permanent
residencies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
fast
growing
states
in
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
mean
that
the
fha
deliberately
established
all
of
these
apartment
houses
in
--
in
florida
in
resort
areas
where
soldiers
wouldn't
come?
chief
justice
earl
warren
reaffirmation
was
in
there,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenthal,
are
there
any
other
states
that
come
under
the
umbrella
of
this
--
of
this
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
other
great
areas
that
are
denominated
as
--
as
resort
areas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
applies
only
to
the
state
of
florida.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
--
why
then
didn't
they
say
so
in
the
act
and
--
and
why
did
they
leave
it
to
this
--
to
this
conversation
between
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
and
the
senator
from
florida
as
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
whether
it
excluded
the
whole
--
whole
state
of
florida?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
the
interpretation
that
the
fha
puts
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
florida
--
state
of
florida
is
out
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
of
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
conversation
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
not
by
reason
of
any
words
that
are
in
the
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
that
your
understanding
also
that
it
was
--
that,
that
conversation
limited
it
specifically
to
--
to
the
state
of
florida
and
did
not
mean
other
--
other
resort
areas
where
they'd
use
this
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
will
you
let
us
know
please
if
it
is
applying
it
to
any
other
states
besides
florida
and
if
so,
to
what
states?
and
if
not,
to
entire
states,
to
what
resort
areas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
well,
i
was
again
in
terms
of
--[laughter]
--
was
again
in
terms
laughing.
