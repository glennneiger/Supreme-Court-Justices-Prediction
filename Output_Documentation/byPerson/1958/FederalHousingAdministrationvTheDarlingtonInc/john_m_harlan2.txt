how
general
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
anybody
turned
down
who
otherwise
would
have
been
eligible
or
have
it
or
--
or
if
you
had
a
little
preference
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
what
you
disagree
is
to
the
original
covering,
original
scope
of
the
act,
namely
that
is
here
today,
as
it
were
not
(inaudible).
do
you
claim
that
the
1954
act
could
be
applied
retroactively?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
--
supposing
the
statute
is
construed
as
the
lower
court,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
construed
it,
namely
that
it
did
not
prohibit,
did
not
prohibit
30-day
tenancy?
justice
john
m.

the
original
act
of
1946.
justice
john

during
the
--
during
the
three
years,
1951
to
1954
that
this
was
going
on,
after
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
federal
housing
administration,
did
they
try
to
enjoin
to
stop
the
30-day
rentals?
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
a
suit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
that
judge
hoffman
--
hoffman
--
his
opinion
was
adopted
by
the
three-judge
court
in
substance
found
that
if
you
were
not
permitted
to
avail
yourselves
of
these
ad
hoc
30-day
rentals,
not
at
the
expense
of
anybody
who
is
entitled
to
a
longer
rental,
but
rather
than
having
them
lying
vacant,
that
that
would
simply
put
a
hold
to
the
project
back
on
the
government's
hands
and
the
mortgage
would
be
foreclosed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
the
record
showed
that
the
darlington
people
had
gone
to
the
fha,
had
disclosed
they
were
renting
the
--
wanted
to
rent
these
things
on
a
--
on
a
basis,
and
asked
for
their
approval
of
a
rent
schedule.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
--
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
have
you
got
to
say
as
to
this
comment
of
judge
hoffman
in
his
opinion?
the
unusual
situation
created
by
reason
of
the
fha's
insistence
to
cease
the
practice
of
renting
apartments
for
periods
of
less
than
30
days
will
admittedly
necessitate,
will
admittedly
necessitate
the
financial
downfall
of
the
darlington
with
the
result
in
the
loss
of
an
initial
investment
together
with
the
monthly
payments
of
$6000
each
beginning
january
or
june
1.
it
certainly
would
not
justify
the
continued
existence
of
darlington,
and
bankruptcy
would
be
the
ultimate
answer,
the
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage
would
follow
with
the
commissioner
of
the
fha
requiring
title,
as
it
is
a
bear
assumption,
no
purchase
or
sale
or
there's
an
amount
equal
to
or
in
excess
of
the
unpaid
balance
due
on
the
mortgage.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
finding
was
adopted
by
the
three-judge
court
afterwards,
wasn't
it?
