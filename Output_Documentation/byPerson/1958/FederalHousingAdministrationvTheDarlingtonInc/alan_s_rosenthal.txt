mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
veterans'
emergency
housing
program,
which
was
established
in
1946.
in
that
year,
congress
was
apprised
that
a
national
emergency
existed
because
of
a
critical
housing
shortage.
in
this
connection,
it
was
called
specifically
to
the
congressional
attention,
almost
3
million
returning
world
war
ii
veterans
and
their
families
would
be
in
need
of
residential
housing
by
the
end
of
1946
and
that
the
majority
of
them
would
not
have
the
means
to
purchase
homes,
and
therefore,
would
require
so-called
"rental
housing".
in
an
endeavor
to
meet
this
acute
problem
in
the
statutory
words
to
accelerate
the
production
of
houses
with
preference
for
world
war
ii
veterans
and
at
sales
prices
or
rentals
within
their
means,
congress
amended
section
608
of
the
national
housing
act
to
authorize
the
federal
housing
administration
to
ensure
mortgages
covering
multifamily
housing
projects
in
which
a
preference
would
be
given
to
veterans.
the
particularly
attractive
feature
of
section
608
was
its
provision
that
the
principle
obligation
of
the
insured
mortgage
could
be
as
much
as
90%
of
the
reasonable
replacement
cost
of
the
project.
this
meant
that
if
the
project
sponsor
served
as
architect
and
builder
of
the
project,
they
could
construct
it
with
little,
if
any,
outlay
of
cash
and
thus,
with
little,
if
any,
risk
of
loss,
that
the
other
10%
would
be
represented
by
architect
fees
and
the
builder's
profit.
now,
judged
by
any
objective
standard,
this
program
established
under
section
608
was
an
immense
success.
well
over
7,000
apartment
houses
were
constructed
containing
over
450,000
rental
units.
these
projects
were
backed
by
government
insurance
in
an
amount
in
excess
of
$3
billion.
with
extremely
due
exceptions,
these
projects
were
successful
in
their
operation,
as
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
rate
of
default
has
run
only
between
1%
and
1.5%
of
the
total
mortgages
outstanding.
at
the
same
time
however,
in
some
instances,
project
owners
having
applied
for
and
obtained
the
advantage
of
government
mortgage
insurance
which
enabled
them
to
build
this
residential
housing
at
little
or
no
cost
to
themselves.
started
to
engage,
endeavored
to
increase
the
profitableness
of
their
operations
in
a
practice
outside
what
we
deem
at
any
rate
to
be
the
scope
of
the
legislative
aid,
namely
the
practice
of
renting
units
for
transient
occupancy.
one
of
these
instances
was
that
of
the
appellee
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
there
are
no
specific
statistics
on
it,
insofar
as
the
record
and
the
congressional
reports
indicate
that
it
could
hardly
be
described
as
a
widespread
practice,
but
there
were
instances
of
it
being
done.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
really
--
really
available
figures
on
the
--
the
precise
percentage
of
instances,
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
characterize
it
as
a
--
as
not
a
widespread
practice,
as
a
limited,
relatively
few
of
the
7000
plus
units
that
were
built.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
appellee's
right
to
engage
in
this
practice
of
transient
rentals.
now,
on
december
1949,
the
appellee
was
incorporated
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
section
608
insurance
of
a
mortgage
covering
a
12-storey
apartment
house
to
be
constructed
in
charleston.
consistent
with
this
purpose,
it's
charter
which
was
prepared
on
a
standard
fha
form,
specifically
prohibited
it
from
engaging
in
any
business
other
than
a
construction
and
operation
of
a
rental
housing
project
so
long
as
any
of
its
property
was
subject
to
fha
insurance
--
insured
mortgage.
the
appellee
submitted
an
application
to
the
fha
for
a
mortgage
commitment
on
a
--
this
proposed
project.
this
application
was
disapproved
by
the
local
fha
officials,
because
the
chief
underwriter
was
dissatisfied
with
the
location,
which
the
apartment
house
was
to
have.
at
the
insistence
of
the
appellee
however,
the
rejection
by
the
local
officials
was
reversed
by
the
fha
officials
in
washington
and
the
mortgage
commitment
was
authorized
not
withstanding
the
local
objection
to
the
location
at
which
the
project
was
to
be
built.
project
was
completed
in
july
1951
and
in
september
1951
as
it
was
required
to
do
under
its
charter
and
under
the
regulations,
the
appellee
submitted
and
the
federal
housing
administration
approved
a
proposed
schedule
of
maximum
monthly
rentals.
and
this
schedule
contained
no
indication
that
the
appellee
intended
to
furnish
any
of
the
partners.
one
month
later
however,
with
the
aid
of
a
parent
corporation
which
held
all
but
three
of
the
1999
shares
of
common
stock
in
a
dollar
form,
the
appellee
engaged
on
a
course
of
conduct
concealed
from
the
fha
which
in
the
words
of
the
court
below
was
a
subterfuge.
first,
without
seeking
fha
approval,
the
parent
corporation
furnished
a
number
of
appellees
apartments
and
the
tenants
of
those
apartments
were
charged
$15
to
$20
a
month
in
addition
to
the
scheduled
approved
rentals.
this
additional
rental
however
was
paid
to
the
parent
corporation
so
that
it
appeared
that
appellee
was
maintaining
its
schedule
of
rentals.
four
month
later
in
february
of
1952,
again,
without
applying
for
permission
or
even
advising
the
fha
that
it
intended
to
do
so,
the
appellee
started
to
rent
his
furnished
efficiency
apartment
on
a
transient
basis
at
the
rate
of
$6
per
day.
now,
the
schedule
rental
on
these
apartments
was
$77.50
per
month
which
broken
down
to
a
daily
basis
would
have
been
less
than
$2.60.
in
order
again
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
complying
with
its
schedule
of
rentals,
the
appellee
divided
the
$6
into
two
parts,
it
retained
the
$2.60
approximately
and
the
balance
was
paid
over
as
a
so-called
"furniture
rental"
to
the
parent
corporation.
additionally,
in
april
of
1952,
the
appellee
submitted
the
required
rental
housing
occupancy
report
to
the
federal
housing
administration.
in
that
report
it
failed
to
disclose
that
some
of
the
units
had
been
furnished
and
were
being
rented
on
a
daily
basis,
despite
the
fact
that
the
instruction
from
the
court
indicated
that
the
report
should
reflect
those
units
if
any
which
were
furnished.
in
short,
at
no
time
from
the
inception
of
the
project
did
the
appellee
make
an
extended
endeavor
to
obtain
a
larger
number
of
residential
tenants
at
the
schedule
of
rentals,
nor
if
i'm
able
to
obtain
residential
tenants
at
those
rentals,
did
it
make
an
endeavor
to
increase
the
occupancy
of
the
project
through
lower
rentals.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
insofar
as
the
record
shows,
no,
your
honor.
but
the
--
our
point
here
is
that
the
appellee
at
these
rentals,
the
appellee
apparently
felt
it
was
unable
to
build
its
buildings,
it
resorted
to
furnishing
apartments
rather
than
to
lowering
their
rentals
in
an
endeavor
to
acquire
tenants
that
way.
and
there's
no
showing
in
this
record
that
their
rents
could
not
have
been
lowered.
now,
what
it
did
here
was
almost
immediately
after
the
establishment
of
the
project,
it
went
into
the
--
first,
into
the
furnish
departments
of
rentals
in
excess
of
those
approved
in
the
schedule.
and
then
when
that
didn't
prove
a
financial
success,
it
embarked
on
the
practice
of
running
the
transients.
now,
it
is
to
be
noted
here
that
the
rental
only
was
a
part
but
gain
was
$77.50
a
month,
that
if
potentially,
these
transient
units
could
have
obtained
up
to
$180
a
month,
considerably
in
excess
of
that.
and
of
course,
it
has
to
be
taken
again
against
the
congressional
background
as
we'll
see
that
congress
was
endeavoring
to
provide
for
the
veterans,
moderate
and
low-cost
rental
housing.
now
in
1954,
the
attention
of
congress
was
directed
to
the
fact
that
some
section
608
projects,
which
it
received
as
government
aid
to
provide
residential
housing
for
veterans
were
being
used
as
the
appellee's
project
for
transit
purposes.
it
further
came
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
that
in
a
due
isolated
instances,
the
record
indicates
that
this
was
between
12
and
15.
where
the
fha
deemed
a
hardship
to
exist,
it
had
granted
permission
for
transient
rentals
and
it
had
done
so
in
the
belief
that
the
power
inferred
to
qualify
the
statue
to
regulate
the
methods
of
operation,
of
the
mortgagor,
gave
it
discretion
in
what
it
deemed
be
to
be
a
hardship
case
to
--
to
permit
this,
but
it
was
done
on
these
12
to
15
cases
only
on
a
special
--
special
request.
well,
this
came
to
the
attention
of
congress.
both
of
the
congressional
committees
concerned
agreed
that
this
practice
clearly
violated
the
legislative
purpose
underlying
section
608
and
that
the
integrity
of
the
multifamily
housing
project
program
required
that
the
fha
take
action
to
ensure
that
the
practice
stopped.
now,
the
house
committee
thought
that
no
further
legislation
was
needed
to
archive
this
end.
senate
committee
however
decided
that
in
order
to
ensure
the
enforcement
of
the
legislative
intent,
a
provision
emphasizing
that
intent
should
be
inserted
in
the
national
housing
act,
and
the
conference
committee
agreed
with
this
view
and
accordingly,
section
513
was
added
to
the
statute.
and
it,
one,
expressly
declares
the
consistent
congressional
purpose
that
housing
projects
subject
to
fha
insured
mortgages
are
not
to
be
used
for
hotel
or
transient
purposes
while
the
insurance
remains
outstanding.
secondly,
provides
subject
to
two
exceptions,
which
do
not
pertain
to
this
appellee,
that
no
new
existing
or
rehabilitated
multifamily
housing
subject
to
an
fha
insured
mortgage
maybe
operated
for
such
purposes.
and
three,
directs
the
federal
housing
commissioner
to
enforce
the
prohibition
with
all
appropriate
means
at
his
disposal
and
authorize
the
attorney
general
in
the
event
that
voluntary
compliance
not
obtained,
to
obtain
injunctive
relief.
now,
the
court
below
has
enjoined
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
the
--
if
your
court
pleases,
the
congress
recognized
and
the
congress
felt
that
the
fha
had
misconstrued
the
statute
a
provision
as
to
methods
of
operations,
but
the
--
but
the
congress
recognized
that
there
were
these
instances
of
expressed
approval.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
so
one
of
the
two
exceptions
to
the
operation
of
this
prohibition
is
that
where
the
fha
gave
approval,
a
mortgagor
can
continue
to
rent
the
number
of
units
that
it
had
been
previously
given
permission
to
rent
on
a
transient
basis.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
follows,
we
think,
for
this
reason,
the
congress
--
in
congress'
view,
the
fha
had
made
a
mistake
in
authorizing
these
12
to
15
projects,
approval.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
this
12
to
15
projects.
in
the
congress'
view
however,
that
out
of
a
sense
of
fairness,
believe
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
impose
this
restriction
now
in
--
on
--
in
those
cases
where
this
specific
approval
erroneously
had
been
given
by
the
fha.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
later
statute
--
well,
of
course,
it
would
be
within
the
--
the
congressional
power
of
course
to
--
to
authorize
this
practice.
but
in
the
congress'
view,
it
at
all
times
had
been
prohibited,
that
the
fha
had
misinterpreted
the
provision
giving
it
control
over
methods
of
operation.
and
what
the
congress
was
saying
is
that
this
practice
has
always
been
contrary
to
the
legislative
purpose,
we're
now
going
to
stop
it,
but
we
are
going
to
make
this
one
exception,
that
where,
and
this
of
course
isn't
the
appellee's
case
at
all.
but
where
the
fha
did
and
erroneously,
give
this
permission,
we
will
let
the
--
the
project
continue,
except
of
course
only
those
units
which
the
fha
had
given
permission
to
rent.
now
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
statute
would
make
an
expressed
exception
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
before
that
case
but
the
point
is
that
the
--
the
darlington
never
came
to
the
fha.
as
the
--
the
record
indicates
as
the
district
court
itself
have
suggested
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
that
this
was
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
the
act,
if
the
court
pleases
again,
as
we
said
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
the
1946
act
which
established
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
this
veteran's
housing
program.
all
the
way
through
it,
is
the
--
the
court
below
itself
recognizes
the
dominant
aim,
the
single
aim
indeed
of
providing
long-term
modest
cost
housing
for
the
veterans.
legislative
history
contains
no
indication
of
any
kind
of
congressional
concern
with
providing
financing
for
hotels
or
for
any
other
kind
of
transient
accommodations.
the
preamble
to
the
statute
to
which
i
eluded
before
talks
in
terms
of
this
statute,
this
program,
acceleration
of
houses
with
preference
for
the
veterans
and
their
families
at
rentals
and
sales
prices
within
their
means.
and
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
--
there
was
a
--
there
is
a
limitation,
a
maximum
limitation
of
three
years.
now,
we
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
however
that
that
does
not
carry
with
it
the
implication
that
anything
less
including
overnight
rentals.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
the
minimum
--
of
course
the
--
the
minimum,
we
--
the
transient
occupancy
is
defined
in
terms
of
30
days.
and
again,
that
of
course
is
a
relatively
arbitrary
figure,
but
the
notion
is
a
long-term
tenant
is
there
for
at
least
that
period
of
time.
and
again,
this
program,
the
reason
why
there
would
have
been
--
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
necessity
for
the
establishment
of
a
--
of
a
minimum
period,
because
congress
was
dealing
here,
expressly
with
this
problem
of
the
veteran
difficulty
in
finding
accommodations
for
his
families,
residential
units,
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
congress
was
addressing
itself
to.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
again
that
the
--
the
whole
program
being
setup
in
terms
of
a
long-term
residential
project,
the
terms
of
the
contract
or
the
terms
of
rather
the
charter,
there
actually
wasn't
a
contract
as
such,
but
the
terms
of
the
appellee's
charter,
the
regulations
of
the
fha,
were
all
geared
in
terms
all
of
this
long
range
operation.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
regulations,
they
talk,
for
example,
in
terms
of
dwelling
accommodations.
dwelling
accommodation
shall
be
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing.
now,
dwelling
accommodations
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
both
in
common
and
in
legal
parlance.
we
first
do
something
which
is
intended
as
a
resident
for
a
person
on
a
more
or
less
permanent
basis.
it
talks
about
leases
in
the
--
in
the
charter.
and
again,
a
lease
is
a
document
which
normally
connotes
a
occupancy
over
a
period
of
time,
and
it
talks
again
in
terms
of,
for
example,
the
deposit,
there
can't
be
--
the
mortgagor
can't
require
a
deposit
of
more
than
one
month's
rent.
and
in
other
places
there
is
again
as
reference
to
one
month's
rent.
we
think
if
the
court
pleases,
if
you
go
through
these
documents,
you
will
see
that
they
are
all
addressed
in
the
terms
of
really
what
congress
had
in
--
in
mind,
which
was
a
long-term
residential
occupancy.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
that
they
are
--
they
are
inconsistent
to
--
with
a
lot
of
conspiracies.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
implicitly
sold.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
absolutely,
and
we
think
also
that
the
rentals
to
transients
is
implicitly,
if
not
expressly
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
objective
as
stated
in
the
statute
of
providing
this
--
this
housing
at
lower
or
moderate
cost.
transient
housing
after
all
is
usually
as
this
case
itself
clearly
indicates,
not
on
a
low-rate
basis,
i
mean
here,
this
--
on
one
month
basis,
one
of
these
efficiency
apartments
would
have
come
to
$180
that
per
month.
and
the
congress
was
thinking
in
terms
again
of
the
--
of
the
moderate
cost,
and
we
think
that
the
charter
and
the
regulations
taken
together
give
a
little
question
that
the
contemplation
all
on
the
line,
the
obligation
which
was
assumed
by
this
appellee
was
that
of
renting
its
apartments
for
residential
use.
now,
the
appellee
has
harped
on
the
--
the
fact
that
the
regulations
referred
to
structures
principally
designed
for
residential
use.
and
if
that
says
that
word
"principally"
means
the
part
of
the
property
could
be
devoted
to
transient
use.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
isn't
residential
use
in
the
--
in
the
context
in
which
the
terms
employ,
that's
right.
now,
i
think
the
court
below
didn't
dispute
that.
the
court
below
said
--
it
just
says
principally
designed
for
residential
use
and
it
was
thinking
about
the
non-principle
part
of
it,
but
as
we
just
show
in
our
brief,
this
term
"principally
designed
for
residential
use",
well,
it
isn't
in
section
608,
it
wasn't
some
of
the
other
statutes
dealing
with
mortgage
programs
and
it
has
been
consistently
interpreted
as
meaning
simply
that
the
--
the
mortgagor
can
put
in
his
building
professional
offices
and
such
commercial
facilities
as
would
cater
to
the
needs
of
the
more
or
less
permanent
occupants.
and
it
has
never
been
construed
as
conferring
any
kind
of
authority
to
rent
to
--
to
transients.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
dealing
of
course
with
the
necessity
for
the
mortgagor's
certification
under
oath
and
the
--
the
--
and
of
course
the
other
provision,
subsection
2.
subsection
--
if
you
look
at
2
(b),
that's
the
--
says
flatly
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provisions
of
this
act,
this
is
on
page
48.
"no
new
existing
or
rehabilitated
multifamily
housing
with
respect
to
which
a
mortgage
is
insured
shall
be
operated
for
transient
or
hotel
purposes,
and
that
covers
the
--
the
gamut.
and
then
again
in
the
enforcement
section
which
is
subsection
(b),
the
--
49,
"the
commissioner
is
hereby
authorized
and
directed
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
this
section
by
all
appropriate
means
at
his
disposal
as
to
all
existing
multifamily
housing
with
respect
to
which
mortgage
was
insured
under
this
act
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
housing
act
of
1954."
the
only
thing
that
subsection
(c)
relates
to
is,
what
is
going
to
be
required
in
the
future
of
my
way
of
--
at
the
time
that
these
mortgages
were
insured.
now,
they
only
can
be
insured
if
the
--
the
mortgagor
certifies
under
oath
that
he
will
not
engage
in
transient
rentals,
so
this
was
merely
an
additional
weapon
that
was
being
placed
at
the
hands
of
the
fha
commissioner
to
ensure
compliance,
but
we
don't
think
that
that
is
at
all
inconsistent
with
our
position
that
--
that
this
statute
is
indeed
clarified
if
clarification
was
necessary,
the
legislative
intent
from
the
very
beginning
that
this
program
was
set
up
for
this
particular
purpose
and
that
the
individuals
who
obtained
the
benefits
of
this
program
were
restricted
to
using
the
property
for
the
purpose
which
congress
says
that
the
program
up
for.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
there's
no
--
there's
no
doubt,
your
honor,
that
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
all
concerned
if
there
had
been
an
expressed
provision
in
the
act,
but
all
i
can
say
is
this.
the
congress
there
again,
that
people
--
that
congress'
attention
was
directed
to
this
particular
problem.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
and
it
was
a
serious
problem
and
it
was
to
that,
that
the
congressional
attention
was
directed.
now,
it
might
have
been
better
had
the
congress
said
that
all
of
these
non-conforming
uses
are
not
permitted.
the
fact
is,
we
submit,
that
even
without
the
expressed
prohibition
that
this
is
implicit,
in
the
statute
and
we
submit
that
these
people
are
governed
by
that,
that
when
the
power
--
if
the
program,
anyway
that
you
would
look
at
it,
the
program
was
setup,
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
for
this
single
purpose.
and
we
think
that
having
gotten
the
benefits
of
the
program,
they
are
obliged
to
comply
with
the
--
to
use
their
property
only
for
those
purposes
which
are
specified.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes,
sir,
because
we
say
this
at
the
very
least.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
there
was
no
vested
right
conferred
upon
these
people
to
operate
as
a
transient
project.but
the
most
there
was
with
an
absence
of
an
expressed
prohibition.
they
can
find
nothing
in
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
in
their
charter
which
conferred
any
kind
of
affirmative
right
on
them
to
do
so.
so
that
there,
we
do
not
have
here
a
case
of
a
fairly
unequivocally
expressed
right
to
rent
a
transient,
which
would
be
entitled
to
congressional
protection
against
a
retrospective
statute.
i
mean
we
draw
in
that
connection
of
course
on
keefe
versus
clark
in
322
which
indicates
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
clearly
and
unequivocally
expressed
right
by
contract
or
otherwise.
that's
just
isn't
here.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
which
statute
did
not?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
again,
that
if
it
--
if
it
didn't,
it
is
only
because
there
was
not
an
expressed
prohibition.
there's
no
question
as
even
the
lower
court
recognized
that
this
was
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
congress.
the
primary
intent
of
the
congress
is
to
provide
this
veterans
housing.
so
that
at
most,
this
was
a
practice
which
was
of
questionable
standing
and
there
wasn't
any
again,
any
clear
and
unequivocally
expressed
right
upon
these
people,
either
by
the
statute
or
by
the
regulation.
it
had
been
a
case
of
the
statute
saying,
"you
may
rent
a
transient,"
so
the
regulation
is
saying
you
may
rent
a
transient.
and
subsequently,
the
congress
were
to
take
that
away,
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
question,
but
here,
there
--
it's
just
that
mere
absence,
there
isn't
anything
here
which
could
be
construed
as
affirmatively
giving
a
right
upon
these
people
to
do
something
which
the
statute
obviously
was
designed
not
to
accomplish.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
it
wasn't
in
any
way
the
clear
an
expressed
right,
it
was
nothing
which
affirmatively
created
this
right.
and
all
that
at
most
it
was,
was
a
congressional
oversight
not
setting
forth
not
only
what
they
wanted
done,
but
all
of
the
things
that
they
didn't
want
done.
but
again
it
was
violating
the
spirit
of
the
--
of
the
1946
act
throughout.
and
we
don't
think
any
rights
were
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
in
this
case,
this
wasn't
a
sale
of
property.
this
--
the
government
was
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
but
it
owned
it
subject
of
course
to
the
--
this
statute
was
subject
to
the
regulations.
and
again,
we
submit,
that
this
was
a
program
set
up
for
this
--
this
purpose,
and
it
was
just
as
if
that
the
congress
had
established
a
program
or
to
say
for
the
construction
of
stables,
that
no
one
i
would
think
would
argue
seriously
that
--
and
provided
this
type
of
benefit
that
the
--
the
mortgagor
could
turn
around
and
use
this
property
if
he
didn't
find
it
profitable
as
a
stable
for
a
--
for
a
garage
or
for
something
else.
the
program
--
the
program
was
set
up
for
one
purpose
and
that's
the
only
purpose
which
congress
had
in
mind
providing
these
people
with
these
--
these
very
decided
benefits
by
way
of
financing.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
record
indicates,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
as
to
this
case,
as
to
the
darlington,
apparently
this
was
not
discovered
until
quite
late
in
--
in
the
proceedings.
there
is
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
fha
had
discovered
other
instances
of
transient
rentals.
and
when
they
discovered
these
instances,
they
tried,
the
record
indicates,
to
put
a
--
to
get
these
people
to
stop.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
they
did
not
--
they
did
not
resort
to
suit.
what
they
did
was,
they
--
they
tried
to
do
it
through
this
period
of
time
by
voluntary
compliance,
there
is
no
indication
of
any
--
of
a
suit.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
of
course,
this
--
the
1954
act
if
your
honor
recalls,
and
--
and
it
provided
certain
specific
weapons,
namely
the
injunctive
process
and
directed
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
the
--
the
fha
couldn't
obtain
a
voluntary
compliance
to
turn
it
over
to
the
attorney
general
for
the
use
of
this
process.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
and
it
was
the
threat
of
turning
the
matter
over
to
the
attorney
general
which
brought
this
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
and
for
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
provision.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
other
properties?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
record
doesn't
--
doesn't
disclose
what
the
--
the
status
of
--
of
the
other
--
of
other
properties
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
we
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
all
of
these
--
these
properties
of
course
are
--
are
subject
to
the
--
the
provision
of
the
act.
now,
i
suppose
you
could
regard
this
in
--
in
part
as
being
a
test
case,
because
it
will
determine
whether
these
--
these
projects
in
the
darlington's
position
can
continue
to
the
rental
transient
or
not.
but
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
fha
was
engaging
in
discriminatory
enforcement
of
these
provisions
against
this
particular
appellee.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
how
many
apartment
houses
are
in
the
category
of
the
darlington.
i
could
of
course
call
upon
the
fha
for
such
information
as
they
may
have,
and
i'll
be
glad
to
furnish
it
if
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
--
i
don't
know
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
just
don't
know
whether
they
have
information
available
on
this
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
on
that
particular
aspect
of
the
problem.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
question
on
page
235
of
the
record,
there
is
a
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
235.
there
are
the
four
which
the
darlington
used
in
connection
with
their
transient
rentals
which
has
on
it,
"have
you
left
your
key,
and
rent,
security
deposits,
telephone,
furniture
rental."
and
i
suggest
that
this
at
least
is
one
indication
that
this
was
not
a
merely
ad
hoc
occasional
relationship.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
but
if
the
court
pleases,
these
people,
right
from
the
very
outset
started
to
rent
--
furnish
apartments
and
rent
furnished
apartments.
they
didn't
wait
to
--
and
to
see
whether
on
a
furnished
basis,
they
could
attract
veterans.
they
went
right
into
the
furnishing
business,
they
charged,
i
think
the
record
indicates,
$15
to
$20
per
month
more.
so
instead
of
this
being
$77.50
apartments,
they
were
$92
or
$97
apartments.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
practice
(inaudible).
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
this
building
was
built
in
--
finished
in
july
of
1951.
they
started
to
furnish
in
october
1951,
they
started
to
rent
to
transients
in
february
1
and
the
fha
didn't
know
it
because
when
they
filed
their
occupancy
report,
they
disclosed
the
fact
that
they
were
even
renting
to
--
even
renting
furnished
apartments.
now,
insofar
as
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
absolutely
not.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
the
record
in
--
the
record
does
not
indicate
that,
what
the
record
indicates
is
that
the
fha
sometime
around
to
december
of
1952
discovers
they
are
renting
furnished.
they
didn't
--
fha
didn't
know
transient,
but
they
knew
that
they
had
furniture
in
some
of
these
apartments.
so
the
fha
then
says
to
the
darlington,
"you
can't
do
this
unless,
one,
that
you
get
a
furniture
rental
schedule
approved,
and
second,
you
agree
not
to
rent
to
transients.
now,
the
record
doesn't
express
--
the
--
the
printed
record
at
any
rate
does
not
expressly
indicate
when
the
practice
of
renting
to
transients
was
discovered
by
the
fha,
but
it's
at
least
an
implication
from
this
later
correspondence,
it
wasn't
until
very
late
in
the
game,
but
they
never
came
and
asked
for
permission.
they
were
doing
this
and
they
were
concealing
the
fact
and
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
court
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
the
court
--
if
the
court
pleases,
we
--
we
don't
think
that
the
record
indicates
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
we
would
suggest
this
that
before
experience
could
tell
them
anything
in
this
instance,
right
--
beginning
with
february,
they
--
they
furnished
60
of
their
units.
secondly,
we
would
submit
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
they
rented
to
transients.
well,
it
was
the
period
from
the
very
end
of
july
to
the
following
february.
now,
on
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
that's
--
that
may
well
be
true.
but
of
course
in
the
interim
here,
they
had
taken
out
60
apartments
without
the
fha's
knowledge
from
the
--
from
the
range
of
unfurnished
apartments.
secondly,
and
this
is
we
think
is
the
very
important
point.
and
this
again,
and
you
view
it
in
terms
of
the
purpose
for
which
this
--
this
program
was
established.
these
people
hit
upon
the
device
of
furnished
apartments
and
then
transients
is
the
way
out
of
their
difficulty.
they
made
no
endeavor
here
to
try
to
and
reduce
their
rents.
the
record
indicates
they
were
in
a
poor
location.
this
isn't
the
fha's
fault,
it
was
their
fault,
they
insisted
upon
it.
before
it
--
but
first,
this
is
being
a
error
of
judgment
on
their
part,
instead
of
trying
to
encourage
veterans
to
come
in.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
program.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
they
go
out
immediately
and
follow
this
--
this
entirely
different
task.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
have
some
information
on
that.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
oh,
excuse
me.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
think
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
the
fha's
position
today
is
that
even
in
the
so-called
hardship
cases
to
which
your
honor
has
alluded,
the
congressional
prohibition
operates
that
they
may
not
do
it.
this
that
--
and
there
was
one
time
they
took
a
--
this
is
right
through
before
1954,
they
thought
that
in
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes.
of
course,
they
--
they
may
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
they
may
not
resort
to
the
transient
rental,
the
advise,
in
an
effort
to
--
to
fill
the
house.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
doesn't
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
oh,
no.
there
is
other
--
again,
we
come
down
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
this
record
on
which
to
base
an
assumption
that
the
darlington
was
faced
with
that
desperate
hobson's
choice.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
as
--
as
a
general
proposition,
we
would
say
that's
right,
and
we
would
say
again
this,
that
if
congress
sets
up
a
program
for
a
particular
purpose,
the
beneficiary
of
that
program
cannot,
because
he's
unable
to
make
a
success
of
the
program
--
to
working
at
the
program
as
it
was
constituted,
go
in
and
into
some
other
completely
different
field
of
endeavor.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
think
that's
correct.
now,
i
might
just
--
if
i
may
i
say
this,
in
answer
to
a
question
that
was
asked.i
had
been
advised
while
i
was
sitting
down
that
there
are
between
12
to
15
suits
now
--
no
10
to
15
suits
now
pending
with
respect
to
this
transient
rental
issue
which
are
of
course
waiting
for
this
decision
to
--
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
no,
the
people
that
were
permitted,
expressly
permitted
prior,
they
have
an
exception.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
it
had
asked
the
fha
for
permission.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
fha
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
under
the
methods
of
operation
clause
granted
it,
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
would
--
i
would
presume
--
presume
so.
i
will
check
--
ascertain
whether
in
addition
to
the
10
to
15
lawsuits
pending,
if
there
are
other
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
instances
of
this,
of
the
persons
in
the
darlington
position
which
would,
if
necessarily
to
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
as
to
the
past,
there
is
no
effect
at
all.
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear
on
that,
that
the
--
the
statute
does
not
impose
any
kind
of
liabilities
with
respect
to
the
past,
so
that
the
government
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
of
course
not.
we're
not
claiming
that
they
are
liable
for
the
--
they
--
their
past
transient
rental
collections
at
all.
our
--
the
effect
of
this
would
be
simply,
that
in
the
future,
they
would
be
prohibited
from
renting
these
units
to
transients.
they
could
furnish
them,
they
can
rent
them
on
a
furnished
basis,
but
not
for
periods
of
time
less
than
30
days.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
examples
of?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
think
that
i'll
make
an
endeavor
to
get
them,
your
honors.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
precisely
what
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
precisely
what
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
don't
--
my
recollection
is
that
the
government
certainly
made
no
admission.
it
--
i
think
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
what
is
--
that
was
true
on
this
record
or
at
least
appears
to
be
true,
is
that
if
the
darlington
continues
its
operation
in
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
continuing
it,
leaving
off
simply
the
practice
of
renting
the
transients
that
they
will
be
in
financial
difficulties.
again,
i
come
back
to
the
--
the
point
that
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
that
i
can
see,
that
on
a
lower
rental
basis
or
by
adopting
certain
other
practices
which
are
within
the
scope
of
the
--
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
the
darlington
could
not
make
a
goal.
but
again
we
would
emphasize
that
if
--
even
if
that
so,
we
say
that
--
that
that
isn't
a
critical
consideration
here,
because
these
people,
i
misspoke
myself
for
this
purpose,
and
we
think
that
whether
they
are
--
were
unable
to
make
a
financial
success
of
the
--
the
project
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
established.
we
think
that
that's
regrettable,
but
we
don't
think
it
is
warrant
for
going
into
some
other
completely
different
line
of
endeavor
and
competing
with
hotels
in
this
case
and
other
transient
accommodations
which
didn't
have
this
type
of
alien
construction,
and
which
congress
clearly,
by
the
1946
act,
was
not
intending
to
setup
competition
for.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
answer
is
here
that
--
to
that
is
this,
that
the
congress
as
determined
by
the
1954
act
that
it
wasn't
incumbent
upon
the
fha,
they
have
been
doing
before
to
determine
what
was
hardship
cases
and
what
weren't.
the
fha
was
given
no
discretion
in
that
regard.
what
the
congress
decided
was
that
they
were
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
the
state
of
florida,
where
as
a
overall
basis,
it's
very
difficult
during
seasons
of
those
years
for
--
to
--
to
rent,
except
on
a
--
on
a
transient
basis.
now,
that
determination,
we
submit,
is
hard,
works
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
the
appellee
and
we
don't
think
actually
the
appellee
is
affected
by
it
and
has
an
--
works
then
as
a
challenge.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
of
course
this
intent
continued
all
along,
as
is
seen
by
the
--
the
express
--
expressed
statement
of
intent
in
the
1954
act,
which
has
this
--
this
provision
for
resort
areas.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
no,
no.
there
could
be
--
the
prior
act
did
not
have
any
provision
for
resort
areas.
the
prior
act
wasn't
dealing
with
the
--
the
transient
rental
problem
directly
because
the
prior
act
again
was
in
terms
of
providing
residential
housing
for
veterans.
the
congress
then
when
it
was
called
to
their
attention
that
there
were
these
activities
beyond
the
scope
of
the
program
as
intended,
got
into
the
matter
of
transient
rentals,
and
513
of
course
has
these
particular
provisions.
but
513
itself,
well
it
has
the
--
the
resort
area
exception,
again
contained
the
expressed
declaration
of
the
congressional
intent
on
the
inception
of
the
housing
act
right
up
to
the
--
the
present
time.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
resort
areas
were
exempted,
your
honor,
because
it
was
--
they
were
deemed
by
congress
to
present
a
special
and
sui
generis
situation.
in
the
resort
areas,
people
in
those
areas
do
not
--
or
--
or
very
small
numbers
actually
established
long-term
residence.
in
that
case,
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
these
projects
were
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes.
but
these
projects
are
presumably
are
established
in
the
--
are
in
the
resort
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
where
the
projects
were
--
were
established
in
florida.
but
congress
in
its
wisdom
chose
to
--
to
setup
this
--
this
resort
area
exception,
but
that
--
at
the
same
time
that
they
again
came
down
with
the
reaffirmation
of
a
--
of
the
legislative
intent,
we
don't
think
of
course
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
if
they
--
as
they
viewed
it,
the
committee
reports
viewed
it,
this
was
merely
a
restatement
of
an
intent
which
they
thought
had
--
was
clear
enough
from
the
--
the
1946
act
itself
when
it's
preamble.
they
weren't
thinking
of
the
1954
act,
section
513
in
terms
of
a
change
in
the
existing
law.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
no,
no.
the
1946
act
didn't
contain
any
--
anything
to
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
initial
--
no
it
made
a
change
in
the
existing
law
to
that
extent,
but
they
didn't
view
the
prohibition,
the
general
prohibition
of
transient
rentals
as
constituting
a
departure
from
existing
law.
and
we
think
that
the
--
the
committee
reports
on
that
indicate
that
quite
clearly,
thus,
i
indicated
earlier,
the
house
committee
for
its
part,
it
didn't
think
that
there
was
any
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
made
a
change
as
to
resort.
and
what
congress
was
doing
in
effect
was
saying
that
we
are
going
to
take
over
the
job
which
the
fha
had
been
in
our
--
in
the
congress'
view
was
proper
in
exercising
before,
under
take
before.
that
of
determining
what
are
the
--
the
hardship
cases.
and
i
said
the
fha
does
not
have
discretion
under
the
methods
of
operation,
we're
going
to
carve
out
the
two
exceptions.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
congress
--
congress
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
i
don't
say
that
they
--
because
they
took
it
out
from
--
took
--
included
a
expressed
exception
for
florida;
as
that
--
in
those
that
--
it
was
in
as
to
everybody
else
before.
i
would
--
all
that
i
said
was
that
congress,
when
they
were
viewing
the
problem
in
1954,
they
deemed
section
513
as
making
no
change
in
its
broad
scope
of
an
existing
law.
they
then
decided
in
their
wisdom
and
this
is
we
submit
is
an
appropriate
subject
of
legislative
resolution
whether
we
might
agree
with
it
or
not,
then
decided
to
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
but
they
then
decided
to
carve
out
the
--
the
florida
exception
and
we
think
there's
no
question
from
the
enforcement
provisions
of
this
act
as
well
as
from
subsection
(b),
that
contrary
what
mr.
long
has
suggested,
the
act
in
terms
applies
to
existing
projects
as
well
as
projects
built
subsequent
to
1954.
of
course,
section
608
itself,
there
have
been
no
mortgages
insured
under
that
section
since
1950,
the
program
expired,
even
though
they
still
are
permanent
mortgage
programs.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
is
--
that
is
my
understanding
of
this
restriction
in
its
operation
to
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
but
i
could
guess.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
but
that's
--
that's
right.
and
that
again,
that
the
statute
declared
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
the
way
i
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
that's
how
i
understand
that.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
my
understanding,
if
i'm
wrong
in
this
regard,
i
will
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
correct
it
by
statement.
it
is
my
understanding.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
how
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
all,
but
i
wouldn't
go
to
that
extent.
that
all
that
i
--
that
i
would
state
at
this
point
is,
it's
--
it's
my
understanding
that
the
--
the
federal
housing
administration
is
--
is
applying
the
resort
area
exception
to
the
state
of
florida
and
i
know
of
no
other
things
in
other
states.
and
whether
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
will
do
that.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes
they
had
a
new
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
they
put
on
the
stand
two
witnesses
and
a
couple
of
affidavits.
it's
in
the
record.
