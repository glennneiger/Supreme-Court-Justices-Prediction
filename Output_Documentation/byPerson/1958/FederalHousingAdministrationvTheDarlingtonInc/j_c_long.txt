mr.
j.
c.
long
mr.
chief
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
it's
been
a
rather
rugged
history
to
this
little
case,
started
about
four
years
ago
and
the
issue
is
a
very
simply
one.
simply
can
congress
pass
a
law
that
will
retroactively
effect
the
vested
rights?
the
facts
in
this
case
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
i've
--
i
must
say
that
i'm
a
little
hard
to
hearing,
not
deaf
enough
to
one
of
those
ear
trumpets
and
i
do
have
a
little
complication,
so
i
want
to
ask
the
justice
to
repeat.
mr.
j.
c.
long
i
intend
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
c.
long
well,
your
honor,
it's
our
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
not
in
the
least,
i
have
been
fighting
that
for
four
years,
and
i'm
right
here
still
continuing
that
when
you
read
the
act
itself,
that
if
you
read
the
act
itself
you
will
find
that's
an
ingeniously
worded
piece
of
legislature.
on
its
face,
it
would
appear
as
if
it
did
as
the
wording
of
the
act,
to
retroactively
apply
to
the
prior
insured
project.
but
when
you
start
analyzing
the
act,
where
it
states
this
act
and
that
act,
you
will
find
that
congress
has
itself
stated
that
this
act
shall
not
apply
to
those
projects
that
was
insured
prior
to
a
state.
in
the
1954
act
that
even
goes
farther
than
that.
it
says
that
shall
not
apply
to
projects
upon
which
a
mere
commitment
had
been
issued
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
and
i
will
say,
if
the
court
pleases,
if
you
will
refer
to
the
decisions
in
the
two
lower
courts,
you
will
find
that
they
didn't
come
out
and
just
say
the
act
was
unconstitutional,
they
simply
state
that
we
simply
hold
that
the
terms
of
the
1954
act
cannot
retroactively
be
applied
to
the
darlington
apartments,
implying
that
the
act
--
the
terms
of
the
act
did
not
apply
to
those
projects
prior
thereto.
now,
i
have
at
some
length
in
the
briefs
here
taken
section
by
section
of
the
1954
act
and
shown
where
the
act
does
not
apply
to
projects
insured
prior
to
the
date
thereof.
you
will
find
that
in
my
brief,
it's
set
forth
starting
at
page
63.
we
take
section
by
section
and
show
that
the
wording
of
the
act
does
not
apply
to
projects
insured
prior
to
the
dates
thereof.
it
has
been
however
the
contention
of
the
government
throughout
that
the
1954
act
was
constitutional
and
it
could
be
retroactively
applied
to
the
prior
situation.
it
would
be
rather
hard
for
me
to
take
and
go
over
this
for
the
court
section
by
section,
but
i
call
your
attention
to
this.
the
enacting
clause
of
the
housing
act
states
that
this
act
will
be
merely
cited
as
the
housing
act
of
1954.
now,
they
distinguish
it
as
i
say,
as
separate
act.
the
second
paragraph
state,
"it
had
been
the
intent
of
congress
since
the
enactment
of
national
housing
act
that
housing
built
with
aid
to
mortgage
and
insured
under
that
act,
be
used
possibly
for
residential
use
and
that
such
intent
excludes
the
use
of
such
housing
for
transient
or
hotel
purposes."
there
was
little
interest
in
side
like
there
that
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
but
--
which
senator
capehart,
who
introduced
this
act,
that
said
it
always
would
be
the
intent
--
has
always
been
the
intent
of
congress
that
it
would
be
used
for
residential
purposes.
when
asked
about
this
act
before
the
committee
hearing,
they
--
he
said,
"i
can't
tell
you
senators
what
was
the
intention
back
there,
and
i
wasn't
him."
so
i
respectfully
submit
that
any
approach
of
one
congress
to
declare
what
was
the
intent
of
another
congress
literally
goes
into
the
use
of
(inaudible)
board
in
my
way
of
thinking,
i
don't
see
how
they
could
tell
what
was
the
intent
of
another
congress.
certainly,
the
gentleman
who
presented
this
act
admitted
that
he
couldn't
tell
what
was
the
intent
of
the
prior
struggle.
now,
and
the
third
paragraph
states
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
it
certainly
does,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
held
that
and
specially
in
the
sioux
indian
tribe
case,
in
an
opinion
of
this
court.
they
went
back
and
said
that
what
one
of
the
committees
i
think
on
--
forget
the
committee,
had
stated
that
it
had
never
been
intended
to
give
the
indians
a
grant
and
that
all
they
had
was
a
easement
to
use
the
land
and
this
court
views
what
that
committee
said
then
and
they
reached
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
grant
had
been
given
to
the
indians
or
not,
that's
under
sioux
indian
case
here
that's
cited
in
the
brief.
now,
the
third
paragraph
states
that
no
multifamily
housing
with
respect
to
which
a
mortgage
insure
under
this
act.
i
take
that
to
mean
the
1954
act,
on
page
68,
shall
be
operated
for
transient
or
hotel
purposes.
the
two
stated
exceptions
however
where
projects
operated
for
transient
or
hotel
purposes
maybe
insured
under
the
1954
act,
where
the
commission
had
agreed
to
such
operations
prior
to
may
28th,
that
was
the
date
of
the
committee
report
to
congress,
and
where
the
project
is
located
in
an
area
which
the
commission
determines
to
be
a
resort
area.
to
us,
that
is
an
unusual
part
of
this
act,
because
in
the
discussion
and
on
the
senate
floor,
senator
(inaudible)
who
was
taking
care
of
the
state
of
florida
said
to
senator
capehart,
said,
"does
that
exclude
the
whole
state
of
florida?"
there
was
no
misunderstanding
about
this.
senator
capehart
said,
"it
excludes
the
whole
state
of
florida
and
the
statistics
we
have
from
the
federal
housing
administration
is
that
there's
10,400
apartments
in
the
state
of
florida."
that
is
excluded
under
this
act,
had
they
been
renting
apartments
prior
to
the
effective
date
thereof.
now,
we
go
to
this,
we
submit
the
term
of
this
act
as
used
in
paragraph
b
specifically
refers
to
the
1954
act.
then
if
you
go
down
to
paragraph
c,
it
says
that
no
mortgage
with
respect
to
multifamily
housing
shall
be
insured
under
this
act.
the
housing
act
of
1954
are
insured
for
an
additional
term
unless
the
mortgagor
agree
he
will
not
rent
any
part
of
the
project
for
hotel
or
transient
purposes.
there
is
the
significant
thing.
they
said
that,
"we
won't
increase
it
unless
you
agree
that
you
won't
do
what
you've
been
doing,
but
if
you
are
willing
for
the
same
amount,
you
can
keep
on
doing
what
you've
been
doing."
you
read
this
throughout
that
it
would
take
all
of
my
argument
if
i
attempted
to
digress
the
--
i
mean
analyze
the
act,
you
will
find
that
the
wording
of
the
act
itself
does
not
apply
to
projects
insured
before
it.
the
first
three-judge
court,
this
case
got
before,
held
that.
the
situation
was
this,
we
appeared
before
judge
hoffman.
judge
hoffman
thought
there
was
a
constitutional
question
involved.
he
asked
for
a
three-judge
court,
our
late
and
beloved
judge
parker
called
the
court.
and
then
when
the
matter
--
he
called
for
brief
and
when
we
set
it
in
the
brief
by
a
per
curiam
decision
by
judge
parker,
judge
timmerman
and
judge
hoffman,
they
sent
it
back
to
the
judge
hoffman
and
said,
"we
don't
need
a
three-judge
court
here,
this
is
a
matter
of
simple
statutory
construction,
does
not
involve
the
constitutionality
of
the
act."
so
then
we
went
back
and
we
had
our
day
before
judge
hoffman
and
the
matter
was
referred
to
this
court,
and
this
court
thought
there
was
a
constitutional
question
and
sent
it
back
and
we
had
our
day
before
the
three-judge
court,
and
the
three-judge
court
adopted
the
decision
of
judge
hoffman
and
here
we
are
now.
and
before
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
i
would
not
think
so
for
two
reasons.
one,
i
would
not
think
so
because
i
feel
that
the
corporate
charter
in
this
case
is
in
a
grave
deal
like
a
lease
or
a
restrictive
covenants
on
the
land.
and
it
is
true
that
the
--
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
federal
housing
administration
which
was
not
incorporated
in
the
charter
itself,
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
becomes
a
part
of
the
charter.
it
said
that
it
shall
be
designed,
not
used,
principally
for
residential
use.
second,
it
said
that
our
corporation
shall
engage
in
the
operation
of
a
rental
housing
project,
it's
our
contention.
and
third,
that
preference
must
be
given
to
veterans
in
the
occupancy
of
the
building.
it's
our
position
that
the
courts
below
was
correct
when
it
simply
held
that
we
had
a
right
to
rent
a
reasonable
number
of
apartments
in
the
building
and
have
them
available
for
transient
use
if
there
was
no
demand
otherwise,
if
there
was
no
demand
otherwise.
to
me,
this
case
involves,
and
we
get
away
from
the
1954
act
not
applying
to
it,
it
involves
this.
congress
when
it
passed
section
608
of
the
act
and
has
set
forth
in
the
appellant's
brief,
and
it's
very
brief
law,
and
i
tell
you
why
it's
a
brief
law.
congress
was
faced
with
a
dilemma.
they
needed
housing,
and
the
--
the
boys
were
returning
home,
the
--
the
young
fellows
that
had
went
out
to
war,
come
back
as
young
men
and
they
needed
--
my
friend
here
stated
not
hundreds
or
thousands
of
houses,
but
millions
of
houses.
congress
unlike
in
any
other
provision
of
the
housing
act,
turned
over
to
the
commissioner,
said,
"you
go
out
and
get
these
houses
built,
you
use
your
emergency
power
and
get
these
houses
built."
we
placed
no
restriction
on
them
at
all,
congress
placed
no
restriction
on
them
at
all.
and
in
not
placing
any
restriction
on
--
on
them
at
all,
congress
had
to
eliminate
a
prior
provision
of
an
act
which
this
act
amended
that
had
required
them
to
be
designed
for
principles
laid
for
residential
use.
now,
having
eliminated
that,
they
said
to
the
commissioner,
"you
go
out
and
get
it."
and
here
is
what
the
act
said,
the
mortgage
on
property
shall
be
held
by
a
mortgagor,
approved
by
the
commission.
the
commissioner
may,
leaving
it
to
his
discretion,
and
his
discretion
requires
such
mortgagor
to
be
regulated
or
restricted
as
to
rents
or
sales.
charges,
capital
structure,
rate
of
return,
methods
of
operations,
rate
or
returns
or
methods
of
operations.
in
that
regard,
i
would
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
he
could
have
--
the
commissioner
could
have
restricted
the
use
of
these
apartments
in
any
way
he
seen
fit,
congress
give
him
that
right.
congress
further
said,
"if
you
are
going
to
use
that
right,
mr.
commissioner,
this
is
a
manner
in
which
you
must
use
that
right."
the
commissioner
may
make
such
contract
with
and
acquire
but
not
exceeding
$100
stock,
or
interest
of
any
such
mortgagor,
as
the
commissioner
may
deem
necessary
to
render
effective
such
restrictions
and
regulations.
now,
he
did
do
that.
he
said
to
--
to
the
darlington
and
my
friend
said
to
7000
others,
in
a
charter
that
they
prepared
as
my
friend
admits,
their
wordings,
their
charter
considered
perhaps
7000
times.
they
said,
"we
are
going
to
put
this
provisions
in
the
charter.
first
we
are
going
to
say
the
purpose
for
which
your
--
your
corporation
shall
organize,"
and
i'm
reading
from
the
charter
itself.
mr.
j.
c.
long
on
page
184
of
the
transcript
of
record.
here
is
the
purpose
as
is
stated.
the
purpose
for
which
the
corporation
is
formed
and
the
business
objects
to
be
carried
on
and
promoted
by
it
are
as
follows.
to
create
a
private
corporation
to
provide
housing
for
rent
or
sale
and
to
acquire
any
real
estate
or
interest
of
right
therein
or
pertinence
thereto,
in
any
and
all
personal
property
in
connection
therewith.
to
improve
and
operate,
to
sella
and
assign
mortgagors.
to
borrow
money,
and
issue
evidence
of
indebtedness
in
further
of
and
all
of
the
objects
of
his
business,
to
secure
the
same
for
mortgage,
deed
of
trust,
pledge
or
lien.
now,
this
is
the
two
provisions
i
call
your
particular
attention
to
is
d
and
e,
because
i
say
this
is
our
lease,
this
is
the
written
contract
that
controls
our
methods
of
operation.
to
apply
for
and
obtained
to
be
caused
to
be
obtained
from
the
federal
housing
administration
a
contract,
a
contract
to
mortgage
insurance.
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
national
housing
act
as
amended,
covering
bonds,
notes,
other
evidence
of
indebtedness
issued
by
this
corporation
and
any
indent
to
a
mortgage
or
deed
of
trust
securing
the
same.
so
long
as
any
property
of
this
corporation
is
encumbered
by
a
mortgage
or
deed
of
trust,
insured
by
the
federal
housing
commission,
it
shall
engage
in
no
business
other
than
the
construction
and
the
operation
of
rental
housing
projects
of
such.
now
e,
to
enter
into,
perform
and
carry
out
contracts
of
any
kind
necessary
to
or
in
connection
with
the
incidental
accomplishment
or
any
one
or
more
purposes
of
this
corporation.
then
if
you
go
further
into
this
charter,
you
will
find
that
the
commissioner
gave
consideration
to
the
term
of
rentals,
stated
first,
"you
shall
not
rent
any
apartment
for
more
than
three
years,
nor
can
you
rent
all
of
the
apartments
in
the
building."
but
the
commissioner
did
not
put
any
limitation
expressly
or
impliedly
anyway
whatsoever
on
renting
apartments
for
less
than
30
days
and
there
was
good
reasons
why,
because
senator
alben
barkley
when
he
introduced
this
legislation,
he
stated
in
the
senate.
he
says,
"an
emergency
is
upon
us,
the
emergency
begets
the
need.
this
act,
we
will
not
introduce
it
as
a
part
of
the
permit
of
housing
act,
but
deals
with
permit
or
housing,
we
need
temporary
housing
to
serve
the
temporary
needs
of
the
veterans,
many
of
them
in
schools,"
senator
barkley
said."
many
of
them
is
out
seeking
jobs,
many
of
them
don't
know
where
the
home
would
be,
they
need
temporary
housing
now
and
i
instruct
the
federal
housing
commissioner
to
go
out
and
use
its
emergency
power
to
produce
those
houses."
i
submit
that
a
project
owner
had
one
of
these
apartments,
had
a
vacant
apartment
and
a
veteran
who
gets
priority
under
the
act,
knocked
on
his
door
and
said,
"i
want
to
rent
this
apartment
for
two
nights,"
how
could
the
project
owner
under
the
law
say
to
the
veteran,
"i
won't
let
you
have
it
for
two
nights,
i
am
limiting
this
for
30-
day
rental."
mr.
j.
c.
long
right.
mr.
j.
c.
long
no,
sir.
it's
not
if
he
intended
that
the
operation
would
be
for
overnight
guests
only,
that's
not
what
he
would
do.
mr.
j.
c.
long
it
could
be
for
one
night
over
two,
it
could
for
one
week
or
three
weeks.
mr.
j.
c.
long
the
part
that
we
state
in
reference
to
that,
that
particular
phrase
does
not,
rental
housing
implies
something
more
than
renting
by
overnight
occupancy.
but
by
the
same
token,
if
the
court
pleases,
in
subdivision
(e),
it

i
think
it
would
be
practical
enough
when
an
apartment
building
the
size
of
the
darlington,
the
156
apartments.
from
time
to
time,
the
people
who
lived
in
that
apartment
may
have
a
relative
come
to
visit
them,
there
is
not
room
for
them.would
the
apartment
owner
be
prohibited
from
renting
that,
a
relative
of
the
regular
owner
for
two
or
three
days,
that's
an
incidental
use.
and
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
the
rental
--
the
transient
is
an
incidental
use.
it's
undisputed,
conceded,
they
sent
the
order
to
charleston
that
no
time
in
the
history
of
this
project
has
much
as
10%
of
the
apartments
been
rented
for
transient
purpose.
mr.
j.
c.
long
i
don't
--
we
don't
content
that
could
set
apart,
no
sir.
we
contend
that
those
apartments
available
then,
and
if
those
entitled
to
priority
comes
in
and
wants
one,
they
are
entitled
to
it,
but
we
contend
that
as
an
incidental
purpose
of
the
operation
of
this
corporation,
that
they
shall
have
a
right
from
time
to
time
when
there
is
no
demand
otherwise,
to
rent
available
vacant
units
for
less
than
30
days
when
they
don't
go
out
and
advertise
as
a
hotel.
they
don't
give
any
bellboy
service,
there
is
no
room
service
attendant
to
it
at
all.
the
only
way
the
record
shows
that
any
man
gets
a
room
in
this
building
for
less
than
30
days
is
to
come
there
and
ask
for
it.
mr.

yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
c.

i
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
would
not
show
that
but
i
think
it
is
in
so
many
words,
but
i
think
the
record
discloses
this,
that
here
sits
a
man
with
his
apartment
building.
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
record
shows
that
at
all
times
when
he
was
renting
for
less
than
30
days,
there
was
other
apartments
available
for
rent
for
more
than
30
days,
there
was
always
vacant
apartment,
the
record
shows
in
this.
the
situation
is,
that
a
man
has
entered
into
a
mortgage,
the
government
has
insured.
he's
got
to
pay
that
mortgage,
and
it
comes,
vacancies
in
his
building.
he
sits
there
and
someone
wants
to
rent
a
vacant
apartment
for
a
night,
a
week
for
which
there
is
no
demand,
he
does
the
intelligent
thing,
he
rents
the
apartment
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
apartment
maybe
rented
overnight
tonight.
tomorrow
it
maybe
rented
for
six
months
or
a
year,
there
is
no
given
apartment
set
aside

i'm
glad
your

called
that
point
to
my
attention
because
i
wanted
to
correct
something.
under
fha
regulations,
you
are
allowed
to
rent
apartments
but
you
cannot
charge
the
tenant
over
one
forty-eighth
of
the
cost
of
the
furniture
per
month.
in
other
words,
the
--
they
was
trying
to
protect
the
veterans.
and
now,
you
can
rent
this
furnished
apartment
but
you
can't
charge
them
over
one
forty-eighth
of
the
cost
to
the
apartment
per
month.
in
this
record,
it
shows
that
many
of
these
--
many
furnished
apartments,
maybe
ten
times
as
many
was
ever
used
for
transient
purpose
was
rented
on
a
monthly
basis
upon
which
the
tenant
only
paid
$14
a
month
for
the
rent,
for
the
furniture
that
went
in
that
apartment.
now,
there
were
some
mentions
made
about
a
corporation
other
than
the
darlington,
buying
that
furniture.
under
this
charter,
the
darlington
cannot
go
out
and
mortgage
any
property
and
it
was
a
question
of
those
that
was
interested
in
the
apartment
putting
the
furniture
in
there
which
the
fha
allowed,
and
so
much
until
now,
they
have
passed
in
such
a
case,
they
passed
a
regulation
that
you
can
put
furniture
in
the
apartment,
you
don't
have
to
--
and
it's
in
the
record
what
i
say.
and
you
don't
have
to
charge
one
forty-eighth,
you
can
charge
what
you
please
but
you
must
sign
that
you
won't
rent
it
for
less
than
30
days.
in
other
words,
if
you
don't
rent
it
for
less
than
30
days,
now
you
charge
what
you
please
for
as
many
apartments
as
you
want,
that's
in
this
record
in
this
case.
now,

the

this,

under

they
couldn't
go
out

buy
it

they
was
losing
money
the
first
nine

they
was
in
existence,
they
lost
70
odd
thousand
dollars.
and
i'd
like
right
at
this
time
to
make
an
observation.
we
talked
about
somebody
making
profits,
only
six
or
eight
cases.
well,
we've
heard
alot
about
windfalls
in
some
of
the
cases,
but
this
is
a
winless
case.[laughter]
my
client,
if
the
record
is
undisputed,
had
over
300,000
of
cashed
american
dollars
invested
in
this
building
when
it
was
completed
and
that's
what
he
is
fighting
to
try
to
save.
mr.
j.
c.
long
the
government
has
a
mortgage
for
$1,300,000
and
they've
been
paid
on
that
now
about
a
100
and
some
odd
thousands,
paid
by
my
clients
at
a
loss
to
them
each
month.
they
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
c.
long
as
a
matter
of
audited
record,
my
client
would
suffer
a
loss
of
more
than
$400,000.
mr.
j.
c.
long
because
the
government
said
the
building
would
cost
so
much
money,
and
i'd
say
the
government
said
the
building
costs
that
because
under
fha
regulation,
they
set
the
contract
price.
my
client
went
out
and
built
this
building
and
the
cost
to
the
building
ran
$300,000
more
than
what
the
cost
was
supposed
to
be.
the
fha
insured
only
90%
of
what
they
estimated
would
be
the
cost,
what
they
estimate
would
be
the
cost.
so
my
client
would
lose
that
$400,000
if
they
went
out
and
if
this
thing
was
foreclosed
because
of
--
mr.
j.
c.
long
well,
this
your
honor,
was
a
suit
where
my
client
brought
against
the
government
because
they
said
this.
this
case
started
when
they
wrote
down
to
my
client
and
said,
"you
can't
rent
for
less
than
30
days."
my
client
wrote
back
and
said,
"listen,
we'd
like
to
find
out
why
we
can't
rent
for
less
than
30
days,
we
don't
see
any
charter
provision
prohibiting
it,
we
want
to
cooperate
but
what
stops
us
from
renting
for
less
than
30
days?"
and
the
deputy
commissioner
of
the
federal
housing
administration,
he
wrote
back
and
said,
"have
you
heard
of
a
new
law,
the
1954
law?"
says,
"that
stops
you
from
renting
for
less
than
30
days."
we
at
charleston
not
too
big
a
place
and
it
is
a
nice
thing
to
have
someone
bring
a
suit
against
you
to
say
you're
violating
something.
so,
my
client
brought
this
declaratory
judgment
suit
just
to
ask
the
courts
to
declare
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
this

to

at

has
it

rented
more
than
10%
or
15%

sometimes
it's
four

at
no

has
it

affidavits
that
was

record
by

to
file
orders
that
were
not
contested.
the
facts
as
found
by
their
own
orders,
showed
that
prior
to
the
time
that
we
started
renting
on
a
transient
basis,
that
the
rental
to
this
project
had
to
be
supplemented
by
the
people
that
owned
it
but
better
than
a
$120,000.
and
the
record
showed
that
if
this
rental
was
not
coming
in,
they
would
still
have
to
supplement
it
to
the
tune
of
many
thousand
dollars
each
month.
mr.

all.

took
the

$6
first,
one-thirtieth

rent
for

they
deducted
