am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
there
was
a
coaxial
cable
of
which
there
were
2400
lines,
and
of
these
24,000
lines,
the
government
had
taken
over
20
of
them.
and
that
as
to
those
20
lines
in
the
channel,
the
government
operated
them
itself
and
the
company
had
nothing
to
do
with
those
lines
except
to
go
in
and
repair
them
on
the
request
of
the
government,
is
that
--
that's
about
--
