mr.
charles
a.
bellows
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
indicted
with
two
others
on
the
charge
of
conspiracy
to
destroy
government
communications.
all
four
of
them
were
convicted
and
all
four
of
them
were
sentenced
to
terms
in
the
penitentiary.
the
conviction
was
taken
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
two
of
the
defendants
--
their
case
was
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial
because
the
trial
court
had
failed
to
give
some
cautionary
instructions
relating
to
the
statements
made
by
the
two
petitioners.
this
happened
more
than
15
months
ago.
the
other
two
defendants
in
the
case
have
not
been
tried.
prior
to
the
indictment
in
the
federal
court
in
mississippi,
the
two
defendants
had
been
indicted,
with
one
of
the
men
who
was
indicted
in
the
federal
court
of
mississippi
on
the
charge
of
conspiracy
to
destroy
the
properties
of
the
southern
bell
telephone
company.
i
represented
the
two
petitioners
in
the
trial
in
cook
county
in
chicago,
and
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
they
were
both
sentenced
to
a
term
of
not
more
than
three
months.
the
sole
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
were
placed
in
jeopardy
under
the
fifth
amendment
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
been
convicted
twice
in
the
state
court
and
then
convicted
again
in
the
--
in
the
federal
court.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
of
extreme
importance.
the
law
has
been
very
carefully
analyzed.
i
know
of
mr.
fisher
personally
from
chicago.
as
your
honors
have
said,
he's
a
very
able
lawyer.
he
made
a
great
research
under
the
law
in
this
case.
and
much
of
the
law
that
i
have
in
my
brief
frankly
comes
from
conversation
with
him
and
from
reading
his
brief
and
of
course
some
personal
research
on
our
part.
but
the
facts
in
this
case
are
extremely
important
because
the
government
raises
questions
that
the
two
offenses
were
not
actually
dissented.
and
so,
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
indictments
arise
out
of
activities
of
some
men
in
connection
with
a
--
with
a
strike
of
the
southern
bell
telephone
company.
a
man
by
the
name
of
shelby,
who
was
an
international
representative
of
the
--
of
the
union,
came
to
chicago
and
communicated
with
a
man
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
apparently,
he
was
seeking
somebody
to
help
him
destroy
the
communications
on
the
properties
of
the
southern
bell
telephone
company
for
the
purpose
of
expediting
the
settlement
of
the
strike.
this
man,
(inaudible),
that
is
the
record,
communicated
with
abbate
and
told
him
that
he
would
receive
a
call
from
somebody
from
the
south.
mr.
shelby
the
representative
was
a
southerner
from
--
also
from
mississippi
and
lived
at
the
time
in
maryland
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
perry,
who
was
the
--
the
president
of
the
local
in
jackson,
mississippi
where
the
act
of
violence
had
taken
place.
and
so,
we
find
that
shelby
contacts
mr.
abbate
and
there
is
a
meeting
between
abbate,
falcone
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
mcleod
who
was
not
indicted
in
this
case
and
shelby.
shelby
has
with
him
the
plans
for
the
destruction
of
the
--
of
the
various
installations
marked.
shelby
had
worked
for
the
southern
bell
telephone
company.
he
knew
the
whereabouts
of
the
various
installations.
so,
on
the
plans,
they
were
located
at
various
spots
where
he
thought
they
ought
to
destroy.
he
gave
abbate
$500
as
a
down
payment
and
said
that
if
they
carried
out
their
job,
there
would
be
more
money
afforded.
there
is
an
effort
made
by
falcone
to
get
some
dynamite,
i
think
it
was
a
pretext.
i
don't
think
falcone,
for
the
record,
could
ever
get
an
indictment.
the
next
day
--
the
next
day,
the
petitioners,
abbate
and
falcone,
tell
mcleod.
mcleod
was
a
man
who
is
on
parole
from
oklahoma
for
having
committed
a
robbery.
they
told
mcleod
that
they
wanted
no
part
of
this
deal
and
that
they
could
make
more
money
by
conveying
this
information
to
the
telephone
company.
they
gave
him
part
of
the
$500
and
mcleod
insisted
on
going
down
to
jackson,
mississippi.
mcleod,
when
he
gets
to
jackson,
mississippi
meets
perry
who
was
the
president
of
the
local
down
there
and
he
also
meets
shelby.
one
of
the
men
connected
with
the
union
took
mcleod
around
and
showed
him
where
the
various
locations
where
they
were
located.
we
expect
to
show
from
the
record
that
both
perry
and
shelby
began
to
have
misgivings
about
mcleod.
and
so,
they
took
him
forcibly.
he
protested.
he
wanted
to
stay
there
and
blow
up
the
installation.
but
they
took
him
forcibly
to
a
railroad
station
and
sent
him
back
to
chicago.
in
the
meantime
--
in
the
meantime
abbate
and
mcleod
almost
the
next
day
the
record
shows
--
almost
the
next
day
after
meeting
shelby,
communicated
with
the
telephone
company
and
told
them
that
they
had
information
in
reference
to
plans
for
the
destruction
of
these
installations.
we
expect
to
show
at
the
most
perhaps
four
or
five
days
later
there
are
conversations
between
abbate
and
the
officials
for
the
telephone
company.
there
was
a
meeting
arranged
between
the
--
the
telephone
officials
who
is
an
investigator
and
a
policeman
acting
as
--
as
a
member
of
the
--
of
the
telephone
company.
they
meet
with
abbate
and
falcone
at
which
time
the
two
petitioners
are
arrested.
they
gave
him
the
plans
that
shelby
had
given
them,
gave
him
all
the
information
and
reference
to
this
plan
with
the
scheme
to
destroy
this
communication.
and
as
part
--
and
--
and
they
didn't
give
him
the
reward.
instead
of
giving
him
a
reward,
they
--
they
indicted,
and
charged
him
with
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
the
property
of
southern
bell
telephone
company.
now,
the
--
the
judge
who
heard
this
case
in
the
criminal
courts
of
cook
county,
i
suppose,
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
these
men
have
almost
immediately
abandoned
the
enterprise.
i
had
raised
the
question
on
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
abandonment
but
the
court
of
appeals
removed
otherwise.
and
in
--
and
in
illinois
there
is
no
need
of
an
(inaudible)
act
--
the
mere
--
the
mere
agreement
between
the
parties,
a
decision
to
constitute
a
conspiracy
whereas
in
the
federal
court,
there
must
be
some
covered
act.
but
the
judge
took
into
consideration
that
these
men
had
come
clean.
they
had
conveyed
all
the
information,
had
told
it
to
the
telephone
company,
had
informed
the
police
and
the
state's
attorney,
and
so
the
--
why
judge
gave
them
not
more
than
90
days
to
both
defendants.
after
the
defendants
had
served
their
time,
the
petitioners
had
served
their
time,
an
attorney
for
the
southern
bell
telephone
company
came
to
visit
mcleod
who
has
been
taken
back
to
oklahoma
prison.
and
this
is
important
because
it's
in
the
record
and
in
some
ways
those
--
and
refers
or
to
the
--
to
the
other
case
that
mr.
fisher
had,
the
bartkus
case.
the
attorney
for
the
telephone
company
came
to
mcleod
and
said,
"i
want
your
help.
the
telephone
company
wants
your
help.
now,
you
can
help
the
telephone
company
by
testifying
for
the
government."
and
so
--
and
so
the
deal
was
made.
mcleod
was
never
indicted.
and
i
think
in
my
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
court
of
appeals,
i
--
i
think
i
stated
that
there
was
a
news
item
that
appeared
in
the
--
in
the
southern
newspapers
that
mcleod
had
been
given
a
parole
at
the
instance
of
the
telephone
company
and
had
been
given
a
reward
of
$7500
for
his
aid
of
the
telephone
company.
but
mcleod
agrees
to
testify
for
the
--
the
government
and
there
is
this
trial
and
there
is
this
--
this
conviction
in
this
case.
now,
it's
important
to
know
just
what
properties
the
telephone
--
the
government
had
which
they
claim
was
the
subject
of
this
conspiracy.
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
directed
at
coaxial
--
at
a
coaxial
cable
and
the
evidence
showed
that
the
coaxial
cable
was
capable
of
transmitting
2400
conversations.
out
of
these,
the
government
had
leased,
owned,
or
operate
--
or
controlled
rather,
not
owned,
leased,
operated,
and
controlled
20
circuits
of
the
2400
circuits
of
the
coaxial
cable.
and
so
we
find
that
the
state
prosecution
was
directed
at
all
the
properties
of
the
southern
bell
telephone
company.
the
government
takes
only
20
circuits
out
of
the
2400
circuits
in
that
coaxial
cable
and
says,
"that
belongs
to
me.
we'll
indict
you
on
that,"
as
that's
--
that's
what
they
did.
well,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
perhaps
got
the
grip
of
what
these
two
petitioners
had
done
and
the
jury
recommended
leniency
as
to
one
but
there
wasn't
much
leniency
to
get
it.
and
one
who
has
recommended
leniency
got
one
year
and
the
others
all
--
all
got
three
years.
now,
it
is
our
position
and
we
concede
that
the
federal
government
within
the
framework
of
its
constitution
and
the
states
may
deal
with
the
same
subject
matter
and
thereby
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
there
--
there's
no
question
about
it.
we
also
concede
that
each
sovereignty
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution
has
the
right
to
determine
what
shall
be
a
defense
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
its
sovereignty.
however,
the
dual
doctrine
should
not
be
extended
to
areas
in
which
its
application
causes
a
violation
of
the
basic
concept
of
justice
which
occurred
in
this
case
where
the
--
where
two
men
are
convicted
and
given
a
sentence
and
then
taken
--
taken
broadly
from
chicago
and
taken
back
to
mississippi,
that
is
hundreds
of
miles
where
they're
forced
to
stand
trial
so
far
away
from
their
homes,
with
all
the
difficulties
that
go
with
a
--
with
a
second
trial.
and
there's
something
basically
unjust
about
convicting
a
man
twice.
mr.
fisher
in
his
--
in
his
brief
says,
an
--
an
acquittal
is
perhaps
worse.
i
--
i
disagree
with
my
learned
friend.
i
think
double
convictions
are
worse.
i
think
it's
worse
to
convict
a
man
once
and
then
convict
him
again.
we
say
this.
that
to
permit
the
--
the
doctrine
of
dual
sovereignty
to
extend
to
this
and
to
nullify
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
will
leave
open
a
large
area
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
which
accused
persons
may
not
avail
themselves
of
the
right
of
the
fifth
amendment
not
to
be
tried
twice.
i
predict,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
i
practiced
for
many
years
both
as
a
prosecutor
and
as
a
defense
lawyer,
i
predict
that
if
--
if
these
convictions
are
prevented
to
stand
that
it
will
open
up
a
great
distance
of
prosecution
by
the
government
on
the
one
hand
and
by
the
state.
we're
asking
no
more
than
the
court
to
apply
what
was
the
common
law
rule
at
one
time
before
the
--
the
so-called
(inaudible).
the
government
in
its
argument
says
this
isn't
the
same
effects.
but
it
is
the
same
effects
because
the
offense
in
--
in
cook
county,
illinois
was
conspiracy
which
means
an
agreement
to
do
an
illegal
thing
or
to
do
unlawful
thing
by
illegal
means.
the
charge
in
the
federal
court
was
also
a
conspiracy.
it
was
again
an
agreement
to
do
an
illegal
thing
and
the
--
the
gist
of
a
conspiracy
is
the
unlawful
combination
of
men
and
their
punishment
for
that.
and
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
the
substance
of
offense
in
this
case
is
only
punishable
by
three
years,
whereas
the
conspiracy
charged
here
is
punishable
up
to
five
years.
the
government
argues
in
its
brief
that
the
federal
offense
is
not
the
same
as
the
state
offense
because
there's
additional
element
here
which
had
to
be
proved,
though
that
this
operation
and
control.
and
it
is
our
position
that
is
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
just
the
same
as
in
a
--
in
a
civil
--
in
a
--
in
a
state
case.
the
--
the
prosecutor
must
prove
that
it
occurred
within
a
certain
county
in
the
state.
and
there
is
really
no
difference.
i
see
no
difference
but
a
verbal
difference
between
the
charge
contained
in
the
indictment
in
illinois
and
the
indictment
contained
in
the
--
in
the
federal
court.
it
is
argued
by
the
government
that
it
is
not
advisable
to
permit
a
state
prosecution
to
preclude
federal
enforcement
of
the
law.
we
don't
quarrel
about
that
the
federal
government
has
a
right
to
enforce
the
law
but
they
could
have
tried
--
they
could
have
tried
the
petitioners
before
the
state.
the
field
could
have
been
preempted
if
it
was
of
that
importance.
if
it
was
of
that
importance
to
the
government,
congress
could
have
preempted
the
field
and
still
has
no
excuse
for
convicting
a
man
twice.
and
this
is
the
first
time
this
honorable
court
has
had
a
chance
to
pass
on
this
exciting
question
and
we
submit
as
mr.
fisher
stated,
the
lanza
case
isn't
a
--
isn't
a
question
involved
in
this
case.
the
government
argues
that
--
that
it
would
mean,
and
raise
of
offenders
to
the
state
courts.
well,
we
didn't.
we
didn't
do
it.
i
think
the
state
courts
are
competent
to
handle
crimes.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
the
--
the
state
court,
the
indictment
was
returned
in
april
and
the
federal
indictment,
i
think,
was
returned
in
august.
is
that
correct?
there
was
enough
time
for
the
federal
government
to
step
in
and
have
tried
it.
and
certainly,
the
federal
government
has
told
the
state
authorities
of
--
let
us
take
in
first.
we
wanted
if
they
had
sent
out
a
case
with
--
with
a
margin
to
take
these
men
and
bring
them
down
to
jackson,
mississippi
for
trial,
they
would
have
tried
it
first
ahead
of
--
ahead
of
the
state
authorities.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
that
--
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
in
its
briefs
several
times
by
at
least
by
innuendo
admits
that
the
--
the
bartkus
case,
the
state
of
the
federal
was
almost
the
same
except
that
it
had
a
separate
sovereignty
involved
in
it.
we
see
no
difference
between
--
actually,
between
the
bartkus
case
and
our
state.
i
--
i
would
say
they
were
both
the
same,
and
although
the
bartkus
case
was
a
--
was
a
robbery,
call
it
what
you
like
and
in
this
case
it
was
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
--
to
destroy
property.
it
is
our
position
in
trying
and
convicting
a
man
twice
for
the
same
act
is
so
repugnant
to
the
american
concept
of
justice
and
fair
administration
of
justice
that
this
court
order
its
power
to
supervise
the
administration
of
justice
and
prevent
the
second
--
the
second
conviction
and
nullify
it.
in
conclusion,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
my
feeling
that
the
second
conviction
by
the
--
in
the
hard
concept
wasn't
commonly
--
embraces
as
a
fair
administration
of
justice
and
it's
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
--
it's
rare.
and
my
belief
in
is
that
in
this
case,
there
was
pressure
by
the
telephone
company
to
--
to
do
this
because
have
the
--
the
attorney
for
the
telephone
company
not
gone
down
to
prison
several
times
to
see
this
man
mcleod
and
finally
cause
him
to
turn
state's
evidence,
or
government's
evidence,
a
witness,
there
would
--
never
would
have
been
any
prosecution.
it's
a
rare
instance.
but
now
if
you
should
decide
that
it
can
be
done,
i
think
there's
been
hesitation
about
it.
but
if
this
court
should
decide
that
it
can
be
done
i
predict
it
--
it
would
open
up
a
complete
double
vest
of
prosecution.
that
--
and
there
are
so
many
ways
of
having
concurrent
jurisdiction
today.
and
it's
so
--
it's
so
easy
to
make
almost
any
crime
also
a
--
a
federal
offense
by
way
of
our
commerce
clause
that
you
would
find
--
you'd
find
in
state
crime,
and
then
if
there
was
a
non-successful
prosecution,
the
federal
government
is
coming
in
and
try
him
again
and
by
its
notice.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
framers
of
the
constitution
at
the
benefit
of
these
old
english
cases.
i
think
the
--
the
idea
that
a
man
can't
be
tried
twice
is
so
engraved
in
the
thoughts,
feelings
of
--
of
our
people
that
i'm
sure
that
the
framers
thought
that
no
man
could
be
tried
in
the
federal
courts
if
he
had
been
acquitted
or
convicted
in
the
state
courts.
and
mr.
justice
black's
observation
concerning
that
proposed
amendment
which
we
set
out
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
i
think
is
a
litigation
of
that.
i
--
i
think
it
was
so
fundamental
to
the
concept
of
early
framers
of
the
constitution,
that
--
that
no
man
could
be
tried
twice.
it's
just
there's
something
repugnant
about
the
argument.
the
ordinary
labor
when
you're
telling
that
a
man
is
being
tried
a
second
time
after
he
has
been
acquitted
once
or
convicted
once
just
can't
understand
how
it
can
be
done.
there's
been
a
question
asked
about
the
--
the
significance
of
the
24,
of
the
20
lines
out
of
the
2400.
now,
there
are
no
actual
lines
in
these
coaxial
cables.
they're
all
frequencies.
and
the
--
the
state
had
tried
these
petitioners
on
the
--
on
the
whole
coaxial
cable,
anything
else
that
the
southern
bell
telephone
company
got.
well,
it's
--
it's
just
an
impulse.
there
are
no
separate
lines.
it
isn't
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
it's
one
--
there,
it's
one
--
it's
a
cable.
and
within
it
are
two
other
cables
running
inside.
but
there
are
no
2400
cables
or
lines
or
wires
running
through
that
coaxial
cable.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
the
government
had
leased
it.
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
they
just
--
just
as
your
--
your
honor
would
do
when
you
have
a
number
given
to
you
in
--
in
the
city
for
your
use
it
was
many
more
than
what
the
government
has.
it
would
just
control
or
i
may
have
a
private
line.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
you
couldn't,
your
honor
couldn't
tell
it.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
two
solid
cables
with
another
cable.
you
couldn't
get
wrench
it
and
you
couldn't
take
it
apart,
we
couldn't
fix
it.
sure
at
the
end
where
the
government
had
it,
were
abundant
of
their
reservation
and
went
on
their
--
on
their
board,
it
was
actually
attached
to
these
automatic
typewriters,
sure
it
could
be
fixed.
but
there
was
nothing
really
to
fix
anyway.
it
was
nothing
really
to
fix
any
place.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
the
evidence
shows
that
before
they
would
go
in
to
fix
some
of
those
circuits,
they
would
just
notify
the
government
that
they
were
coming
in
and
they
were
going
to
repair
it.
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
it
certainly
wasn't
the
cable,
unless
something
broke
somewhere
down
the
line
on
the
--
on
the
coaxial
and
became
disconnected
or
a
thunderstorm
or
a
--
or
tornado
may
have
turned
that
hot,
but
there
really
isn't
anything
to
--
to
repair.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes,
i
suppose
the
government
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
but
we're
--
we're
not
raising
here
the
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
the
control
that's
been
over.
but
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
then,
it's
the
same
thing.
my
point
is,
the
government
says
--
now,
there
are
different
cases
because
the
government
had
20
of
them
and
that's
why
it's
a
different
case.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
there
was
an
effort
made
to
amend
this
act,
to
--
to
carry
the
word
"lease".
somebody
in
--
in
the
senate,
i
forget
--
get
his
name
right
now,
attempted
to
propose
an
amendment
to
this
act
to
include
the
word
"lease"
because
it
was
a
real
question
whether
or
not
the
operated
control
is
the
same
thing
as
--
as
leasing.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
oh
no,
your
--
your
honor.
i
do
say
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
yes,
it
protected
in
that
respect,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
if
there
anything
has
to
be
done,
the
telephone
company
will
just
call
up
the
government
official
and
say,
"we're
coming
in
and
we're
going
to
fix
it."
that's
--
that's
all
there
was
to
that.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
i
had
a
lease
wire
and
the
telephone
company
wanted
to
come
in
and
fix
them
--
the
line
and
i
--
just
says,
"no,
you
can't
do
it."
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
i
--
i
would
agree
that
the
government
could.
it
--
it
has
come
to
my
attention
since
i
began
to
talk
but
there
is
a
case
pending
now
in
philadelphia
where
a
person
was
charged
with
robbing
an
interstate
ship
and
was
acquitted.
and
that
the
pennsylvania
state
prosecutor
is
awaiting
the
outcome
of
what
happens
here.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
well,
it
just
wouldn't
try
him
again.
mr.
charles
a.
bellows
wouldn't
try
him
again.
i
--
i
don't
remember
in
all
the
years,
i
--
i've
never
heard
of
any
cases
except
the
bartkus
case
and
--
and
this
particular
case.
should
this
--
should
the
court
permit
this
to
be,
then
i
predict
that
there'll
be
a
great
plenty
this.
