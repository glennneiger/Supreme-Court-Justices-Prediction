mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
position
embraces
two
points.
the
first
which
is
a
--
a
non-constitutional
basis
for
the
determination
of
this
case
is
that
the
offense
for
which
the
federal
government
prosecuted
the
petitioners
is
a
different
offense
from
the
illinois
offense.
it's
a
different
offense
not
merely
verbally,
but
it's
different
because
it
embodies
different
gist,
different
purposes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
in
the
--
in
the
bartkus
case,
the
legislative
history
of
the
bank
robbery
statutes
shows
that
those
statutes
were
enacted
to
aide
what
was
basically
a
local
law
enforcement
problem
to
aide
the
states
in
protecting
banks
against
robbery.
it
was
first
--
the
--
the
state,
the
local
law
enforcement
problem,
there
were
subsequently
the
federal
statute
which
was
enacted
to
aide
the
states
in
enforcing
the
laws.
with
respect
to
this
statute
however,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
it
was
enacted
after
the
civil
war.
it
was
enacted
as
a
military
measure.
it
was
referred
to
the
house
military
affairs
committee.
during
the
civil
war,
the
--
the
federal
government
nationalized
the
telegraph
facilities.
and
any
act
destructive
of
those
facilities
was
--
was
an
enemy
act,
and
very
severely
punished.
subsequently,
legislation
was
enacted
authorizing
private
companies
to
operate
telegraph
facilities
and
to
use
the
public
domain,
giving
certain
priorities
to
the
federal
government
and
giving
the
federal
government
the
power
to
repurchase,
to
--
to
purchase
the
property,
to
nationalize
the
telegraph
facilities.
ultimately,
it
was
decided
as
--
as
the
case
today
that
that
private
industry
would
--
would
operate
the
telegraph
facilities,
but
--
but
this
statute
which
was
passed
in
1874,
and
as
--
as
i
say,
was
referred
to
and
recommended
by
the
house
military
affairs
committee.
it
was
designed
to
protect
the
interest,
the
direct
primary
interest
in
the
federal
government
in
maintaining
its
--
its
vital
communication
facilities
free
from
destruction.
there
is
no
history
here
of
the
federal
legislation
being
designed
to
aide
the
states.
and
--
and
the
--
the
interest
of
illinois
in
this
case
is
the
interest
of
a
state
in
its
police
power
in
protecting
private
property.
illinois
has
a
--
has
a
common
law
conspiracy
of
crime,
a
common
law
conspiracy.and
it
was
that
--
that
statute
which
was
violated
in
this
case.
illinois
protecting
private
property,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
an
essential
element
of
the
illinois
crime
that
the
particular
private
ownership
be
alleged,
and
--
and
had
there
been
a
trial,
had
there
been
a
plea
of
guilty,
it
would
have
been
essential
element
for
the
illinois
to
prove
the
private
ownership
of
that
property.
we
submit
that
however
adequate
illinois
may
have
regarded
the
three-month
sentence
imposed
upon
petitioners
for
having
conspired
to
destroy
property
located
not
in
illinois,
but
located
in
mississippi,
louisiana,
and
tennessee.
that
is
not
the
measure
of
a
federal
government
to
protect
its
communication
facilities.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
facilities
were
operated
and
controlled
by
the
--
by
the
federal
government
on
page
7
of
the
--
the
--
on
page
7
government's
brief,
in
--
in
footnote
3.
we
described
the
nature
of
the
government
operation
and
control
over
these
facilities.
some
of
these
circuits
were
used
by
the
strategic
air
command
which
had
its
communications
headquarters
nearby
and
they
were
part
of
the
national
emergency
warning
systems
of
--
the
strategic
air
command
could
get
aircraft
off
the
ground
in
an
emergency.
the
circuits
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
government
did
not
own
them.
no.
they
were
owned
by
the
bell
telephone
company.
the
government
leased
them
under
--
under
contractual
agreements
with
the
telephone
company.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
some
of
these
were
operated
by
the
government
exclusively.
the
--
the
telephone
company
could
come
in
and
--
and
make
repairs
or
--
or
deal
with
the
--
with
the
physical
facilities
only
with
the
approval
of
the
federal
government.
some
of
these
circuits
as
--
as
we
indicate
were
--
were
teletype
circuits
and
they
were
marked
as
government
circuits.
and
the
--
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
none
of
the
--
the
facilities
in
this
case
were
not
owned,
that
--
that
the
petitioner
has
conspired
to
destroy,
were
not
owned
by
the
federal
government.
they
were
operated
and
controlled
by
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
federal
government.
the
--
the
cable
itself
was
owned
by
the
--
by
the
telephone
company
until
the
point
that
it
entered
into
--
into
a
military
installation.
and
from
thereon,
the
--
the
physical
facilities
were
--
were
owned
by
the
federal
government.
but
the
facilities
which
were
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
correct.
those
--
those
are
the
facilities,
the
distribution
facilities
after
the
line
enters
--
enters
the
--
the
government
preservation
itself.
the
answer
to
mr.
stewart,
future
air
force
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
was
--
it
was
charged
that
they
conspired
to
destroy
facilities
that
were
operated
and
controlled
by
the
federal
government,
not
the
facilities
on
the
government
reservation
themselves,
no.
this
--
whether
in
fact,
these
facilities
were
operated
or
controlled
by
the
federal
government
was
a
--
disputed
at
the
trial,
it
was
a
--
one
of
the
questions
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
whether
these
facilities
were
in
fact
operated
or
controlled
by
the
federal
government.
this
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
as
to
that
question.
certiorari
was
limited
to
the
question
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
debate.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
contractual
arrangement
between
the
telephone
company
and
the
government
was
that
the
control
of
the
facilities
would
be
in
the
government
and
it
was
only
with
the
permission
of
the
government
that
the
telephone
company
could
come
in.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
it
was
like
a
leasing
arrangement.
during
the
duration
of
the
lease,
the
--
the
possessory
right
was
in
the
government
if
they
--
if
they
--
as
if
they
have
rented
anything
else.but
this
business
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
they
had
rented
its
use
and
the
telephone
company
could
do
nothing
whatsoever
with
respect
to
it
without
the
prior
permission
of
the
federal
government.
some
of
these
circuits
caried
--
caried
cryptographic
messages
and
--
and
the
--
before
any
private
individuals
could
--
could
do
anything
with
respect.
this
is
the
testimony
at
the
trial.
the
permission
of
the
federal
government
is
--
is
required.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
it
--
it
had
control
over
any
circuit,
over
anything
which
contained
a
circuit
which
had
been
leased
to
the
government
and
which
was
so
marked
some
of
these
circuits
that
the
government
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
required
the
telephone
company.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
suppose
the
entire
cable
might
--
might
have
--
might
have
been
destroyed
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
been
destroyed.
but
before
the
--
before
the
telephone
company
could
do
anything
with
respect
to
any
of
those
any
cable
which
contained
a
frequency,
leased
to
the
government.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
government
has
to
assent.
if
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
my
--
my
impression
is
that
the
government's
assent
was
required
only
with
respect
to
those
circuits
which
the
government
had
--
had
designated.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
the
government's
interest
here
in
preserving
those
20
circuits
particularly
in
the
case
with
those
circuits,
were
of
vital
military
importance
where
they
were
part
of
the
national
emergency
warning
system
of
the
strategic
air
command,
for
one
of
the
mailer
when
she
was
lost
and
--
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
entirely.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
i
--
i
would
contrast
here
the
--
the
interest
of
illinois
in
preserving
the
sanctity
of
private
property
reflected
in
the
general
conspiracy
statute
of
illinois
with
the
specific
interest
under
federal
government
in
preserving
communication
facilities
vital
to
the
--
to
the
national
welfare
invalid.
i
think
it
--
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
are
different.
they
have
different
purposes
and
this
wasn't
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
bartkus
if
--
if
one
assumes
that
in
the
bartkus
case,
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
federal
government
are
the
same.
i
think
that
is
the
ground.
i
think
we
have
different
statutes
here
with
different
legislative
history.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
--
i
think
and
--
and
that
--
that
brings
me
to
my
second
argument,
which
is
that,
even
if
the
statutes
were
identical
except
for
the
jurisdictional
difference.
that
it's
inherent
in
the
concept
of
federalism,
that
the
state
cannot
include
the
federal
government
from
enforcing
a
valid
--
a
valid
federal
policy.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
case,
other
issues
in
the
bartkus
case
is
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
(voice
overlap)
position.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
would
--
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
is
of
--
of
importance
that
in
this
case,
the
federal
prosecution
followed
a
state
conviction
and
not
the
converse,
because
they
think
the
interest
of
federal
supremacy
is
--
is
different.
in
here,
you
--
you
do
not
have
a
state
revising
what
the
federal
government
has
done.
you
have
the
federal
government
saying,
"we
will
protect
our
--
our
facilities
as
we
see
fit
regardless
of
--
of
what
the
state
has
done."
now
of
course,
congress
can,
if
it
wishes,
if
that's
in
accord
with
congressional
intent,
can
preclude
a
federal
trial
following
a
--
a
state
conviction
or
acquittal.
and
congress
has
done
that
on
--
on
many
occasions
and
we
cite
at
pages
36
and
37
of
our
brief,
statutes
passed
by
congress
in
which
it
has
specifically
stated
that
if
there
shall
be
a
--
if
there
is
a
prior
state
acquittal
or
conviction
arising
out
of
the
same
acts,
that
shall
preclude
federal
prosecution.
and
chief
justice
taft
in
the
lanza
case
in
which
he
upheld
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
--
to
try
a
man
after
a--
and
try
a
state
conviction,
said
that
this
is
something
which
congress
can
--
can
deal
with
if
it
sees
fit.
and
we
think
it's
inappropriate
that
the
matter
be
left
--
be
left
to
congress.
when
we
--
when
we
assume
that
there
--
the
identity
of
interest
dealing
now
with
this
--
the
alternative
argument
that
--
that
is
advancing,
of
--
of
course,
the
--
there's
always
the
problem
of
preemption.
of
--
of
course,
there's
no
such
problem
in
this
case
because
if
there
had
been
federal
preemption,
petitioner's
complaint
was
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
and
--
and
not
to
this
court.
the
government
regards
it
as
--
as
very
important
to
the
enforcement
of
major
federal
policies
that
the
power
to
--
to
prosecute
under
these
circumstances
be
upheld.
there
are
areas
where
conflicts
exist
between
the
policies
of
the
states
and
of
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
conduct
which
both
nominally
or
otherwise
designate
as
criminal.
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
prohibition
case
lands
itself,
illustrates
that
and
--
and
chief
justice
taft
is
concerned
about
the
fact
that
the
state
courts
might
be
used
as
--
as
an
avenue
to
obtain
immunity
from
the
federal
government
which
regarded
this
as
a
far
more
serious
matter
than
did
the
states
for
violation
of
the
particular
statutes
that
are
involved.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
there
is
none.
there
is
none.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
agents
of
the
--
of
the
--
there
--
of
course,
there
--
there
were
government
--
there
are
fbi
agents
and
--
and
military
officers
who
testified
as
to
the
nature
of
these
circuits
and
--
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
as
to
--
they
testified
as
to
the
operation
and
control.
yes,
there
was
extensive
testimony.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
know
of
no
federal
--
the
state
has
presented
in
the
plea
of
guilty
and
so
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
testimony
there.
we
cite
at
pages
44
and
45
of
--
of
our
brief,
an
opinion
by
a
district
judge
in
--
in
oregon
in
1884.
and
we
think
that
his
language
is
--
is
--
was
very
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
pages
44
and
45
of
the
government's
brief.
and,
that
had
reference
to
the
civil
rights
legislation
which
had
been
recently
been
enacted
and
to
the
possibilities
which
might
exist
of
state
action
being
used
to
frustrate
federal
enforcement
of
the
--
of
civil
rights
legislation.
as
--
as
the
government
said
to
this
court
in
its
brief
in
the
screws
case.
with
respect
to
civil
rights
legislation,
it
is
the
general
policy
to
defer
to
--
to
wait
to
see
what
the
states
would
do.
and
if
the
states
in
fact
initiated
a
bonafide
prosecution
where
--
where
the
acts
which
were
criminal
under
the
state
law
also
violated
federal
civil
rights
statute
to
wait
and
see
what
the
states
did.
and,
if
the
states
took
action
themselves
which
adequately
protected
the
federal
interest,
then
the
federal
government
would
not
act.
and
we
submit
that
that's
a
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
would
not
--
would
not
act,
i
think
that's
a
--
it's
a
crucial
difference.
we
think
that's
a
very
healthy
policy.
that
makes
for
a
more
harmonious
state
federal
relations,
but
the
alternative
which
is
suggested
is
that
there'll
be
a
race,
that
there'll
be
either
preemption
which
--
which
is
not
always
possible
unless
a
--
a
drastic
remedy
or
that
they'd
be
erased.
so
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
have
in
--
in
mind
the
fact
that
in
the
nelson
case,
the
court
pointed
out
this
was
not
--
not
a
general
police
power
of
--
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
i
think
--
i
think
there
--
there
maybe
areas
which
are
of
such
interest
to
the
state
that
--
that
perhaps
they
--
they
cannot
be
preempted.
but
--
but
those
are
the
alternatives,
preemption
or
the
race.
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
substituted
for
the
--
for
the
present
policy
of
--
of
deferring
in
--
in
areas
where
--
where
conflict
between
the
states
and
--
and
federal
policies
may
exist,
the
policy
of
deference
to
see
whether
the
states
themselves
take
adequate
correction
--
corrective
measures.
instead
of
that,
the
federal
government
would
--
would
be
faced
with
the
situation
of
--
of
knowing
that
if
it
waited
to
see
whether
the
states
themselves
acted
to
correct
the
situation,
it
would
forever
preclude
the
federal
government
from
acting.
and
in
this
--
the
barnhart
(ph)
case
which
--
which
the
government
cites
at
--
at
page
44
and
45
to
which
i
made
previous
reference,
the
judge
went
on
and
said,
"indeed,
if
the
trial
and
the
acquittal
of
punishment
in
the
state
court
under
such
circumstances
is
a
bar
to
a
prosecution
in
this
court
for
the
crime
of
which
these
defendants
stand
indicted
herein,
it
is
difficulty
to
see
why
a
pardon
by
the
governor
of
the
state
would
not
have
the
same
effect."
and
he
went
on
to
say,
"that
of
course,
that
was
inconceivable
in
our
federal
system
that
a
state
should
have
the
power
to
preclude
the
federal
government
with
enforcing
the
federal
policy."
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
my
--
my
--
the
purpose
of
my
reference
is
to
show
the
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
you
can't
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
--
and
all
i'm
saying
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
you
can't
be
sensible
and
cooperative.
and
the
federal
government
can't
say,
"we
will
wait
and
see
if
the
states
adequately
protect
this
matter
in
which
the
federal
government
also
has
a
vital
interest.
if
waiting
would
mean
that
the
federal
government
would
be
forever
precluded
from
acting
if
the
states
act.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
--
well,
in
--
in
the
most
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
the
argument
is
predicated
on
the
--
on
the
concept
which
--
which
one
finds
in
the
federalist.
that
--
that
in
our
federal
system,
there
is
a
--
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
--
and
that
each
sovereign
can
act.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
oh,
yes.
i
think
it
would.
i
would
think
it
would
support
the
argument
that
it
is
not
the
same
offense
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
in
the
--
in
the
first
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
no
person
should
twice
place
in
jeopardy
for
the
--
for
the
same
offense.
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
the
supremacy
clause
indicates
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
well,
i
think
that
it
in
the
light
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i'm
familiar
with
--
with
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
reference
is
so
brief.
it's
--
it's
so
cryptic.
one
does
not
know
whether
that
merely
meant
to
say
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
merely
meant
that
the
first
amendment
applies
only
to
the
federal
government.
it
might
have
meant
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
i
might
have
meant
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
found
--
i
found
nothing
which
would
go
counter
to
the
concept
that
in
a
federal
system
which
there
is
supremacy
in
the
federal
government,
that
action
taken
by
the
subordinate
state
governments
could
preclude
the
federal
government
if
need
be
from
trying
a
man
a
second
time
if
that
was
necessary
to
enforce
the
laws
enacted
by
the
--
by
the
supreme
government
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
find
nothing
which
dealt
specifically
with
this
problem.
i
know
that
as
--
that
the
interpretations
placed
by
this
court
from
the
--
from
the
earliest
days
have
been
to
support
the
notion
that
a
man
can
buy
a
single
act
such
as
an
assault
on
--
on
a
federal
marshal
violate
the
laws
of
both
the
state
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
and
the
sovereign
and
be
prosecuted
for
each.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
language
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
cited
by
--
by
chief
justice
taft
after--
after
he
enunciates
the
rule,
he
cites
perhaps
12
of
15
decisions
by
this
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
with
--
i
think
that
they
support.
i
--
i
think
they
support
the
proposition
that
it
has
been
the
understanding
in
this
country
since
the
--
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
that
a
man
may
be
tried
by
both
the
federal
and
the
state
--
and
the
state
government.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
the
--
the
understanding
of
--
of
the
authors
of
--
of
that,
the
language
in
those
opinions,
in
fact
did
follow.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
the
only
thing
that
i
have
found
is
the
--
the
proposed
amendment
to
which
your
honor
had
reference.
and
that
does
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
for
the
same
offense.
and
--
and
the
--
the
concept
i
think
of
federalism
is
that
it
is
not
the
same
offense.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
certainly
in
the
federalist.
certainly
in
the
federalist.
in
number
32
in
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
this.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
those
are
early
english
cases.
the
--
they
dealt
with
this
situation
and
they
dealt
with
the
case
of
england
saying
--
england
being
the
--
the
sovereign
of
citizenship,
saying
that
it
shall
be
a
crime
for
an
english
subject
to
meet
a
--
commit
a
crime
anywhere
in
the
world.
and
in
the
hutchinson
case
for
instance,
the
defendant
committed
a
crime
in
portugal.
and
he
was
tried
in
portugal
and
acquitted.
thereafter,
he
was
sought
to
try
it
in
--
in
england
and
it
was
said
that
--
that
that
could
not
be
done.
in
other
words,
that
the
sovereign
of
--
the
sovereign
of
the
citizenship,
the
national
sovereign
would
accept
the
acquittal
of
the
territorial
sovereign.
i
think
that
there
are
different
concepts
involved
when
you
are
dealing
with
coequal
sovereigns
and
--
and
matters
of
international
relations
and
comity
between
states.
i
think
that
that
poses
a
different
problem
than
problems
of
american
federalism
where
there
is
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction,
where
the
act
which
the
man
commits
directly
violates
the
interest
of
the
--
of
the
federal
government.
it
is
not
a
--
a
derivative
interest
derived
from
--
from
that
of
--
of
some
--
some
foreign
sovereign.
i
think
the
cases
which
--
which
professor
grant
analyzes
in
his
--
in
his
articles
which
--
which
raised
this
question
are
distinguishable
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
--
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
acquittal
cases.
and
this
is
a
conviction
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
acquittal
cases.
and
this
is
a
conviction
case.
and
on
the
grounds
also
that
they
are
not
cases
which
deal
with
the
peculiar
problems
of
american
federalist,
i
--
i
can
see
why
england
would
say,
"we
will
not
be
concerned
with
whether
a
man
has
a
--
with
the
accusation
that
a
man
has
committed
a
murder
in
portugal,
whether
our
citizens
have
behaved
themselves
abroad,
"if
the
territorial
sovereign,
if
portugal
says,
"no,
he
did
not
commit
the
murder."
i
think
the
english
interest
then
would
be
adequately
protected.
their
citizens
would
not
be
--
he
kept
violating
the
laws
of
--
of
foreign
countries
if
the
countries
said
they
haven't
violated
the
laws.
that's
--
that's
different,
i
think.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
english
opinions,
these
are
very
early
cases.
that
some
of
them
are
in
--
are
in
french.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
my
recollection
of
the
opinion
is
that
it
--
it
merely
stated
the
result.
this
is
--
this
is
in
the
most
part
of
my
analysis.
although
in
--
in
the
welch
case,
there
was
a
problem
of
interpreting
a
statute
which
made
it
a
crime
in
--
in
england
to
commit
an
offense
in
wales,
and
as
a
matter
of
--
of
determining
the
extent
of
the
extraterritorial
statute.
they
said,
"(inaudible)
in
wales
is
a
good
thing
in
england."
where
the
crime
is
committed
in
england,
in
wales
where
the
--
where
the
territorial
sovereign
had
acquitted,
and
where
the
--
the
basis
of
english
jurisdiction
was
an
extraterritorial
statute.
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
those
--
that's
a
different
problem.
that
is
not
the
problem
which
--
which
--
to
which
this
court
addressed
itself
in
--
in
lanza
and
--
nor
to
which
it
addressed
itself
from
the
language
which
it
use
in
--
in
those
--
the
cases
upon
which
lanza
relied.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
certainly
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
proposed
amendment
in
the
fifth
--
proposed
amendment
to
the
fifth
amendment,
i
think
certainly,
the
material
there
is
so
meager
that
--
that
we
dealt
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
we
don't
know
if
--
