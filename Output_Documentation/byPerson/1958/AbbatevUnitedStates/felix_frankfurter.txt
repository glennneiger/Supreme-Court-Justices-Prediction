justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
lines
not
--
if
other
than
government
lines
were
out
of
order
and
had
to
be
repaired,
would
the
repairing
have
to
be
done
of
physical
properties
that
were
under
the
control
of
the
government?
or
are
--
are
these
--
i
don't
understand
it
but
i'm
holding
that's
about
it.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
government
had
such
a
hold
on
the
--
the
cables
or
the
channels
that
it
controlled
repairs
to
be
made
on
the
lines
other
than
those
which
it
itself
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
the
circuits
which
it
used
and
which
got
out
of
the
repair,
influence
through
connections
or
otherwise,
circuits
which
it
had
not
used.
the
next
thing
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
had
to
assent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is,
the
government
assent
was
restricted
to
what
will
come
to
if
it
loses
control
or
whether
its
assent
would
also
require
as
to
and
possibly
operated
were
not
under
--
that
were
not
in
fact
used
by
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
my
inquiry
derived
from
this
differentiation
that
the
government
has
only
20
out
of
2400.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
took
20
out
of
2400
is
irrelevant
and
meaningless
with
reference
to
our
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
thank
you
for
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
view
in
this
case
is
not
in
bartkus,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
not
or
would
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
get
the
thought
or
rather
--
i
think
i
had
fairly
understood.
but
i
don't
quite
get
it.
i
appreciate
direction
of
the
argument
in
your
reference
of
what
the
government
may
have
in
the
screws
case,
the
argument
before
us.
i
rely
on
--
on
a
medial
recollection.
as
i
remember
long
time
ago,
as
i
remember,
the
point
of
that
argument
was,
one,
to
ameliorate
the
--
the
fear
of
a
construction
of
the
civil
right
statute
in
the
screws
case
of
excessive
taking
over
and
those
upon
they've
attributed.
and
the
government
made
that
argument.
i
think
there's
much
to
it
myself.
that
the
government
is
going
to
be
wise
and
benevolent
and
careful,
and
it
will
not
unduly
interfere
with
what
the
law
of
--
of
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
why
i'm
between
two
governments
in
the
same
spot
and
try
to
be
sensible
and
cooperative
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
worked
out
a
common
result.
that
quality
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
constitutional
question,
not
a
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
your
argument
is
on
the
basis
of
sensible
relationship.
it
can't
be
on
the
basis
of
constitutional
exclusiveness,
one
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
involves
not
fairly
some
sections,
it
is
also
necessarily
involved
that
the
show
has
to
go
on
from
sensible
cooperation.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
it
might
have
been
pertinent
to
make
two
or
more
observations.
in
the
first
place,
that
the
materials
that
we
have
regarding
the
proposal
and
the
debates
in
the
congress
and
the
adoption
of
the
resolution
that
the
submission
of
the
bill
of
rights
are
so
meager
and
so
inadequate
to
discourage
judgment
and
not
as
yet
be
based
on
it.
there
is
now
under
way
a
de
--
detailed
study
which
eventually
may
give
us
the
full
record
which
it
thus
far
had
not
been
public.
there
are
manuscripts
but
not
have
been
in
public.
and
what
we
have
to
be
entered
are
all
too
meager
basing
the
judgment
on
what
was
meant
to
what
was
said
and
taking
the
events
to
this
day
in
england,
october
22nd,
1958.
a
man
who
appealed
from
a
conviction
and
get
the
reversal,
can't
be
retried.
(inaudible)
double
jeopardy,
it's
very
different
from
ours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
make
an
argument.
i
make
a
statement.
[laughter]
that's
part
of
the
fact
that
should
be
taken
into
account.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
know
what
else
was
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
we
need
to
work
on
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
united
states
permission
on
the
publication
of
historical
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
supplement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
at
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
government
commission
that
has
its
work,
professor
(inaudible)
who's
at
work
on
these
materials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
find
it
because
the
materials
are
not
yet
available.
they're
in
manuscripts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
the
government
say
no,
if
they
wanted
to
come
in
and
repair
whatever
there
was
to
repair?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
that
mean
with
full
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
desire
to
get
your
permission
to
do
something,
don't
you
control
my
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
what
the
point
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
i
--
the
inference
i
get
from
your
argument
is
important.
it
is
valid
here
that
the
government
has
no
special
interest
to
protect
its
cryptographic
word,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
because
i
understand
that
it's
protected
by
--
not
even
relying
to
the
telephone
company
turned
in
and
accept
why
it
say
so.
isn't
that
right?
