william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
none
of
them
was
owned
by
the
federal
government,
you
say?
none
was
owned
at
least
one
of
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
the
cables?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
reference
in
the
footnote,
the
distribution
cable,
is
something
into
which
the
cables
within
these
facilities
tied
up,
is
that
it?
where
the
sentences
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
some
instances
where
the
military
owned
the
distribution
cable,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
--
does
that
distinguish
this
case
from
bartkus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
that
might
mean
that
this
is
the
result
that
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
then
to
say
that
the
result
should
be
the
same
for
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
of
them
happens
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly
in
the
record,
(inaudible)
stand
to
show
whether
federal
prosecution
was
prompted
in
many
ways
by
the
length
of
the
state
court's

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
of
southern
cables
and

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

21
(inaudible)
rather
than
--
the
government
has
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
they
need
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
are
you
telling
me
that
looking
at
these
transactions
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two
solid
cables?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
this
--
meaning
(inaudible)
the
government's
dissent
was
get
in
there
and
repair
them,
what
--
what's
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
they
repair?
that's
what
i
don't
follow.
what
repair
did
they
decide,
the
cables?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
uncle
sam
says,
"no,
you
can't
do
this,"
then
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
question
that
the
government
could
deny
the
telephone
company
access
to
whatever
it
has
