why
do

not

possible

has
jurisdiction
over

justice

do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
the
literal
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
itself
is
accepted
as
it's
written,
but
suppose
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution
anywhere
else
that
indicates
that
meant
that
the
federal
government
itself
subject
a
man
for
a
second
punishment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
supremacy
clause,
you
think
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
--
would
you
think
it's
relevant
at
all
that
when
the
amendment
was
up
in
the
congress,
a
suggestion
was
made
that
it'd
be
amended
so
as
to
limit
it,
the
fight
for
indefinite
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
that
take
you
back
to
this.
do
you
think
it
has
any
relevance
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
say
that
--
do
you
think
it's
relevant?
now,
do
you
think
if
what
came
before
it
with
the
expression,
vigorous
expression,
the
man
was
needed
to
be
tried
and
punished
twice
or
to
be
tried
the
second
time
after
he
was
convicted.
did
you
find
anything
in
that
which
indicates
that
the
government
was
free
to
prosecute
a
man
the
second
time
as
he's
been
tried
for
the
same
offense
somewhere
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
depend
somewhat
on
how
you
look
at
the
amendments
how
you
gave
emphasis,
would
it
not?
to
what
was
said
by
time
it
was
up.
and
maybe
that
was
wrong,
maybe
that
doesn't
--
on
to
which
it
should
be
construed.
but
was
the
one
single
word
said
by
anybody
in
connection
to
that
amendment
which
indicates
that
the
federal
government
to
prosecute
a
man
the
second
time.
that
was
all
the
language
expressing
a
hostility
based
on
tradition
and
history
of
putting
a
man
to
trial,
apply
the
punishment
for
the
same
offense
without
regard
to
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
you
--
you
mean
you
found
that
repeated
and
repeated
and
repeated
in
the
state.
that
he
can
be
punished
by
both
of
them.
but
that's
subjecting
him
for
double
jeopardy.
i
understood
mr.
fisher
to
argue
quite
the
contrary
to
that.
that's
in
his
study
of
the
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
support
when
you
cited
them
for
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
follow,
because
they
can
be
tried
by
it.
that,
maybe
it
should
be
followed
from
the
cases
but
does
it
follow?
because
a
man
can
be
tried
by
both
the
state
and
federal
government
for
one
offense,
one
crime,
one
state
effect,
one
misconduct.
that
the
federal
government
can
then
prosecute
him
the
second
time
after
he's
been
prosecuted
by
the
state.
is
that
possible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
found
anything
in
the
history
of
the
amendment
itself
outside
of
those
opinions.i
asked
because
i've
been
looking
to
see
if
i
can
find.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
state
--
what
about
the
states
and
before
that
as
referred
to
the
hostility
doing
in
trying
a
man
or
punish
him
twice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
for
the
same
offense,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
--
you're
talking
about
a
concept
now.
was
there
anything
about
that
concept
in
any
of
the
discussion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they're
referred
rather
emphatically
to
the
history
which
has
been
referred
to
here
in
england
and
in
this
country,
as
they
just
did
not
make
a
man
himself
applied
for
the
same
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
early
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
as
the
--
we
--
that's
a
reasoning
that
the
--
the
english
court
used
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
that
case,
you're
talking
about
portugal
case.
did
they
base
their
decision
on
the
reasoning
of
just
suggestion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
accept
that
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
short
--
in
short,
but
it
says
they
offered
the
amendment
that
was
denied,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
--
you
can
buy
in
anything
additional
and
anything
that's
permitted
that's
already
done,
would
you
submitted
to
us?
