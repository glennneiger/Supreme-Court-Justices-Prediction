justice
felix
frankfurter
what
were
the
provisions
of
the
new
york
law
which
--
which
is
implied
as
much
--
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
corporations
are
necessary
to
imply
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask,
right
before
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question.
there's
a
decree
--
the
decree
permits
these
very
persons
to
get
their
lawyer
to
drop
a
piece
of
paper
and
file
it
in
albany
and
then
do
business
under
the
same
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
he
answer
yes
to
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
understand
that.
i'm
asking
whether
the
decree
--
whether
if
you
did
that,
would
you
have
a
citation
for
contempt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
--
spell
it
out
some
more.
are
you
prepared
to
say
that
a
lawyer
advising
these
persons
who
are
the
affected
--
the
personalities
behind
the
corporations
would
not
be
sailing
close
to
the
law
if
he
said
you
could
draw
up
new
articles
of
incorporation
and
file
it
at
albany
and
call
yourself
the
international
--
whatever
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
royall
if
--
if
the
decree
is
supportable
otherwise
on
the
ground
that
this
corporation
was
an
agency
and
instrumentality
for
violating
the
sherman
law,
the
fact
that
there
was
some
innocent
stockholders
would
be
not
relevant
to
the
validity
of
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
option
is
not
open
under
the
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
ask
about
that.
i
don't
--
would
you
mind
completing
what
it
is
that
would
be
logical
in
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
it
could
be
boxing
or
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
this.
does
it
mean
that
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
on
december
15,
1960
to
be
left
to
a
--
for
a
boxing
championship
match
or
--
and
then
use
it
for
some
--
suppose
they're
exhibitions,
french
or
russian
ballet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
that's
very
different
from
happening.
justice
felix
frankfurter
9000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
40

justice
felix

according
--
you
gave
us
an
early

mr.

the
transcript
of
record
in
stenographic
minutes,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you're
dealing
at
large
before
you
come
to
details,
may
i
put
to
your
questions
at
large?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
deny
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
function
of
this
court
or
the
power
of
this
court
of
the
propriety
of
attitude
of
this
court,
though
you
will
between
the
weight
to
be
attached
to
finding
the
facts
based
on
evidence
and
the
proper
scope
of
this
court
in
reviewing
a
decree
fully
allowing
great
weights
to
the
discretionary
scope
in
allowing
light
scope
of
the
discretion,
but
is
there
any
other
difference
between
finding
the
weight
would
which
finding
affect
on
the
evidentiary
matters
leading
to
the
conclusion
of
illegality
and
the
attitude
of
this
court
to
take
towards
a
decree
particularly
to
the
decree
of
novel
proportion
to
the
scope?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
had
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
put
in
my
question
with
the
proper
scope
to
be
given
to
the
discretion,
to
the
wide
area
within
which
the
judge
could
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
nevertheless,
a
decree
is
an
odd
measurement
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
to
the
facts
and
that
does
not
lie
within
the
peculiar
knowledge
of
the
district
judge.
this
court
has
constituted
frequently
in
the
sherman
law
cases,
modified
decrees
as
to
which
one
couldn't
say
they
were
illegal
in
any
event
of
jurisdictional
power,
but
this
court
found
that
they
were
not
quite
appropriate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this,
and
i
--
it
carries
--
now
my
question
carries
(inaudible).
i
just
want
to
know
the
fact
whether
the
decree
that
they
had
before
us
was
formulated
by
the
government
and
permitted
to
get
a
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
that
central
purpose
be
satisfied
and
mitigated
by
making
conditions
as
to
the
non-monopolistic
use
of
the
garden
rather
than
also
requiring
them
to
get
out
of
the
garden?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
--
i
cannot
follow
your
argument
with,
i
think,
full
appreciation
that
you
didn't
want
to
close
up
the
garden
as
the
medium
for
exhibiton
or
what
are
they
called,
boxing
events,
but
i
don't
follow
you
in
saying
that
that
evidence
that
says
you
take
them
away
from
the
garden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
ryan
did
find,
but
i
think
one
can
take
over
judicial
notice
of.
that
at
the
time
the
combination
was
entered
into,
people
rightly
thought
it
was
not
a
combination
within
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
inception
of
the
combination,
i
should
think
it
was
rather
the
accepted
notion
that
boxing
was
not
within
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
this
court
decide
that
on
the
1954.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
had

decision
and
justice
holmes'
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
it
was
baseball,
but
i
think
it
required
refinement
to
differentiate
baseball
from
boxing
as
within
the
sherman
law.
that
required
a
good
deal
of
scrutiny
whatever
effect
of
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
very
different
story
as
i
tried
to
indicate
in
what
i
said
in
this
case
when
would
it
be
affirmed.
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
point
is
--
may
i
put
my
point
to
you,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
seems
to
me
important
in
determining
the
scope
and
the
validity,
the
propriety
of
a
drastic
decree.
to
me,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
what
kind
of
a
decree
is
entered
by
a
chancellor
if
people
broadly
speaking
with
i
hope
and
violate
the
law,
rather
than
a
violation
is
retrospectively
found
which,
i
respect,
is
a
violation
because
he
protects
all
chancellors,
but
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
what
kind
of
a
decree
you
impose
on
people
if
would
i
hope
you
to
violate
the
law
as
against
having
been
made
a
bad
mistake
and
guessing
it
as
to
what
this
court
will
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
prophylaxis
has
something
to
do
with
the
kind
of
--
with
the
state
of
health
on
the
person
against
whom
you
have
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
could
by
the
conditions
that
he
imposed
as
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
limitation
of
the
number
of
exhibitions
and
the
other
controls.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
himself
could
it
suicide,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
called
it
suicide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
there
a
difference
between
taking
the
grip
of
control
away
from
people
and
taking
them
out
altogether?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
the
divestiture
limited
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
dissolved
the
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
should
equity
do
a
useless
thing
if
let's
say
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
substitute
--
well,
then,
if
--
what
is
the
use?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
next
day,
they
can
have
other
paper
--
issue
a
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
you
can
substitute.
not
if
you
can
produce
an
identic
replica
the
next
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
the
decree
is
harsh
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
it
was
harsh?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
it
bares
on
the
fact
that
it
just
doesn't
rank
they
were
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
even

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
wants
to
stay,
even
when
it
came
to
his
stay,
he
took
into
account
that
these
were
unusual
and
unprecedented
provisions,
isn't
that
true?
justice

yes,
but
do
you

justice

i
didn't
say
he
said
