charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
royall,

i
ask
you
sir.

this
i.b.c.'s
have
any
physical
assets
or
are
they
just
show
instrumentalities
for
the
promotion
of
these
contests?
justice

whittaker
valuable
goodwill?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
stock
could've
been
sold
for
something?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
royall,
is
that
because
in
addition
to
divestiture
there
is
some
injunction
against
madison
square
garden?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
out
--
justice
charles

whittaker
and
the
result
would
be
that
without
their
resistance,
the
corporation
would
suffer
in
getting
this
so-called
legitimate
business?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there
would
be
no
legal
prohibition
against
madison
square
garden?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

is
the
theory
of
that

claim
that
if
you
get
it
on
to
certain
parts
and
hold
it
against
you
on
the

that
rather
than
the
report
to
divest
themselves
from
that
stock,
accept
that
court
resolution
and
ask
us
tremendous
decrees
only
to
enjoin
boxing
and
perhaps
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice

could
they
do
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

do
in

whittaker
(inaudible)
enjoin
them
from
using
the

from
using
the

go
for
it,
the
defendants
came
in
and
said,
“oh
well
we
want
you
to
and
here's
the
order
letter.”
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
