mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
before
responding
to
the
various
specific
contentions
that
had
been
advanced
by
general
royall,
i
should
like
to
make
a
general
observation
as
to
what
from
the
point
of
view
of
those
of
us
on
the
government
side
of
this
litigation.
it
appears
to
be
the
basic
misconception,
basic
error
that
underlies
and
permeates
the
appellant's
position
on
this
appeal.
that
error
as
we
see
it
consist
simply
in
this
that
the
case
is
being
presented
to
this
court
precisely
as
if
the
case
were
still
in
the
district
court.
this
court
did
not
sit
to
re-weigh
the
evidence,
to
retry
the
facts,
to
recast
the
decree.
that's
the
function
of
the
district
court.
when
the
case
was
here
at
the
1954
term,
it
was
remanded
by
this
court.
the
court
holding
that
the
complaint
had
--
had
stated
the
cause
of
action.
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
substantiate
the
allegation
to
the
complaint.
the
case
went
back
to
judge
ryan.
there
were
extensive
pretrial
proceedings,
interrogatories,
depositions,
case
retried
over
a
period
of
two
months,
not
only
extensive
oral
testimonies
in
the
record,
but
documentary
exhibits,
agreements,
memoranda,
contracts
with
stenographic
transcript
in
this
case
covers
about
4600
pages.
the
printed
record
alone
is
three
volumes.
that
was
all
before
the
district
court,
after
a
trial
of
two
months.
judge
ryan
took
the
case
under
advisement.his
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law,
on
the
merits
were
delivered
in
--
on
march
8,
1957
after
he
had
had
arguments
on
the
law
and
the
facts,
proposed
findings
and
conclusions
by
both
sides.
the
arguments
that
your
honors
have
heard
today
were
the
arguments
that
he
considered.
the
case
has
been
presented
as
if
he
had
not
rejected
those
arguments,
as
if
he
had
not
found
the
fact
contrary
to
the
interpretation
given
to
the
evidence
by
the
defendants,
the
appellants
here.
this
proceeding
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
district
court
or
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
appellants
have
failed
to
face
up
to
the
burden
which
rests
upon
an
appellant
in
a
case
ofthis
sort.
the
burden
arising
out
of
fundamental
principles
of
appellate
review,
the
principle
of
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
are
to
be
accepted
or
not
to
be
set
aside
here
unless
shown
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
the
rule
codified
in
rule
52
(a)
of
the
federal
of
the
civil
procedure.
the
rule
which
has
been
given
special
emphasis
and
application
in
respect
to
the
big
antitrust
case
involving
such
a
case
typically
does
and
as
this
case
does.
the
complex
of
economic
facts
clearly
erroneous
ruled
this
court
has
said
in
the
gibson
case
means
that
the
appellant
has
the
burden
of
satisfying
this
court
after
all
is
said
and
done.
leaving
it
with
a
clear
and
firm
conviction,
a
definite
firm
conviction
that
a
clear
mistake
has
been
made.
now,
the
appellants
have
not
contended
that
the
--
the
district
court
here
applied
any
erroneous
standard
of
law
as
to
the
factual
question,
that
contention
which
is
usually
made
the
basis
of
attack
on
finding
the
fact.
that
isn't
here.
instead,
the
approach
has
been
taken
and
it
has
been
to
take
out
a
--
bits
and
pieces
of
evidence,
the
testimonies
scattered
throughout
the
record,
and
argument
is
to
each
one
of
these
pieces.
in
itself,
it's
a
reasonable
transaction
actuated,
proper,
legitimate
motives,
no
conspiracy,
no
combination,
no
evil
in
that.
now,
that's
not
the
way
in
which
the
--
of
an
appellate
court,
this
court
deals
with
findings
of
conspiracy
particularly
--
in
antitrust
cases.
there's
a
patent
case
in
226
u.s.,
the
old
swift
case
in
196
u.s.
the
court
specifically
said
that
when
it
deals
with
findings
of
conspiracy,
it
won't
fragmentize
the
record.
it
won't
take
each
little
piece
and
look
at
it
in
itself
because
the
whole
maybe
vastly
different
and
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts,
looking
at
the
whole
conspiracy,
looking
at
all
constituent
elements.
you
may
discern
or
design
the
significance
which
is
not
apparent
from
each
particular
piece.
now,
not
with
standing
that,
the
approach
that's
been
taken
here
has
been
to
present
the
case
as
if
there
were
no
findings
of
facts.
mr.
philip
elman
i'm
making
--
i
think
that
that
applies
to
the
whole
case
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
philip
elman
as
to
the
relief,
i
think
there
too.
they
--
the
appellants
have
failed
in
our
opinion
to
give
adequate
respect
to
the
rule
--
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all.
i'm
very
--
very
--
i'd
like
to
take
up
each
of
the
particular
arguments
that's
been
made
here.
but
i
think
by
way
of
introduction
that
put
--
put
our
position
at
least
in
proper
perspective.
i
think
that
the
--
this
court
in
effect
is
being
asked
to
hear
and
decide
this
case
to
be
noble
as
if
judge
ryan
had
not
gone
through
the
process
of
weighing
the
facts,
deciding
what
the
evil
was,
what
the
main
gravamen
of
the
case
was
and
whether
he
had
not
himself
wrestled
as
he
did
with
the
question
of
what
to
about
it.
now,
there
has
been
--
there
have
been
references
to
judge
ryan's
characterization
of
some
of
the
provisions
and
the
decree
is
harsh
and
drastic.
well,
it's
true.
judge
ryan
did
at
one
time
consider
that
some
of
these
provisions
were
harsh
and
drastic.
that
was
his
initial
reaction.
he
had
--
he
had
responded
to
the
request
of
the
defendants
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
relief
that
it
is
a
better
proposed
judgment
has
had
the
government
and
the
defendants
should
ask
to
be
heard
as
to
the
provisions
that
should
be
included
in
the
decree.
and
those
hearings
also
extended
over
a
period
of
--
of
a
month.
there
are
about
9000
pages
of
transcript
just
under
relief.
mr.
philip
elman
it
wasn't
--
mr.
philip
elman
9000
pages
in
a
stenographic
transcript,
the
bulk
of
volume
two
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
total
--
the
total
is
about
1800
and
about
900
were
devoted
to
relief.
the
bulk
of
volume
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice,
the
index
to
the
record,
the
printed
record
at
the
beginning
of
each
volume,
the
last
number
of
the
original
is
4623.
if
you
look
at
the
last
number,
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
referring
to,
the
4600
pages
of
the
original
record
4623,
1595
pages
of
printed
record.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
the
abstract,
perhaps
the
answer
is
yes.
but
in
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
reason
why
the
judge
ended
the
relief
he
did
was
based
entirely
upon
his
appraisal
of
the
facts,
not
as
appraisal
of
what
the
conspiracy
and
the
evil
here
consisted
of.
mr.
philip
elman
now,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
but
the
burden
upon
him
who
was
searched
that
the
provision
of
a
decree
is
not
appropriate
is
indeed
a
very
heavy
point.
asking
this
court
and
with
its
limited
opportunities
for
studying
the
case
to
substitute
its
judgment,
if
the
matter
is
one
of
judgment
as
to
what
in
fact
will
dissipate
the
illegality,
what
will
prevent
a
recurrent
or
continuation
of
the
violations
of
the
law.
those
questions
of
judgment,
we
don't
--
we
believe
can't
be
answered
by
looking
at
the
provisions
of
the
sherman
act
to
the
constitution
or
an
equity
hornbook.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
record.
mr.
philip
elman
and
when
you've
--
when
you've
got
that
kind
of
a
judgment,
when
you've
got
the
approach
that
this
court
has
taken
in
the
paramount
case,
the
crescent
amusement
case,
the
international
salt
case
and
others
recognizing
that
that
the
--
that
this
function
inherently
is
one,
that
the
trial
judge
must
assume
the
principal
responsibility
and
burden.
of
course,
no
one
acts
as
a
rubber
stamp,
and
let
me
say
this
in
answering
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
that
i
can
say
here
that
judge
ryan
demonstrated
throughout
this
period
as
to
the
relief
questions
that
he
was
not
a
rubber
stamp
for
either
side,
that
he
was
not
so
intent
on
what
ought
to
be
done
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
at
the
very
beginning
and
he
wasn't
going
to
be
barging
on
it.
but
it's
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
judge
ryan
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
decree
that
you
have
before
you
is
peculiarly
the
creation
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
philip
elman
the
principal
--
the
principal
provision
here
that's
under
attack,
the
divestiture
provision
was
substantially
--
was
proposed
by
the
government
substantially
modified
by
judge
ryan.
the
provision
as
to
compulsory
leasing
of
the
stadium
was
proposed
by
neither
side.
it
was
suggested
to
the
parties
by
judge
ryan
after
he
had
heard
a
testimony
from
the
chairman
of
new
york
state
athletic
commission,
mr.
julius
helfand.
mr.
helfand
put
in
a
plea
for
the
independent
promoters,
the
small
men
who
are
on
the
fringes
of
this
business
and
who
--
he
--
he
said
--
he
suggested
to
the
judge
that
those
independent
small
promoters
who
are
now
in
the
nonchampionship
promotion
should
have
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
garden.
and
he
--
judge
--
the
judge
thought
that
there
ought
to
be
some
provision
in
the
decree
in
the
nature
of
compulsory
leasing
on
a
reasonable
rental.
and
the
extraordinary
thing
about
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
that
after
judge
ryan
has
made
this
proposal
in
the
court,
several
days
later,
the
defendants
embraced
that
proposal.
they
incorporated
in
their
own
proposed
judgment,
didn't
complained
to
him
about
it.
and
that
--
and
the
precise
terms
in
which
it
appears
in
the
final
judgment,
your
honors
will
find
duplicated
in
the
proposed
form
of
judgment
which
is
in
the
records
starting
at
page
621.
this
is
the
defendant's
adoption
of
a
proposal
initiating
from
the
judge
and
not
from
the
government.
the
government
had
proposed
that
the
garden
and
norris
and
wirtz
to
be
permanently
barred
from
the
business
of
promoting
championship
contest.
the
judge
said
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
unnecessarily
severe
and
he
accepted
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
the
defendant's
proposal.
that
provision
is
to
limiting
the
defendant's
to
two
championship
contest
a
year,
your
honors
will
find
in
the
proposed
form
of
judgment
submitted
to
the
defendant
--
by
the
defendants
to
the
court.
now,
i
can't
ask
your
honors
to
accept
what
i'm
saying
here
without
suggesting
even
--
even
a
casual
scrutiny
of
the
first
page,
the
eary
part
of
volume
two
to
this
record
in
which
judge
ryan
deals
with
these
questions
of
the
decree.
you
have
an
unusual
glimpse
of
the
judicial
mind
and
action
here.
he
followed
the
practice
of
engaging
in
colloquies
with
counsel
as
he
went
along
from
day
to
day
telling
him
--
telling
them
frankly
what
was
on
his
mind,
what
his
difficulties
were,
inviting
them
to
address
themselves
to
these
problems
that
he
had.
his
initial
reaction
to
the
divestiture
of
provision
was,
it's
too
harsh,
it's
too
drastic
but
as
the
evidence
was
presented,
it
was
mainly
the
defendant's
evidence.
the
longer
he
parted
it,
the
more
--
he
reluctantly,
he
said
over
and
over
again
to
the
--
didn't
want
to
come
out
this
way.
but
he
--
the
longer
i
ponder
over
this,
he
said,
the
more
convinced
i
am
that
the
basic
evil
here
is
the
combination
between
norris
and
wirtz,
these
mid-western
businessmen
and
in
that
madison
square
garden
corporation
in
new
york.
he
had
to
break
that
off
that
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
prevent
possible
recurrences
of
the
restraints,
the
monopolization
which
he
had
found
was
to
breakup
that
monopoly.
now
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
the
--
his
findings
of
fact
as
to
--
as
to
the
relationship
between
these
two
groups.
in
1949,
when
this
conspiracy
was
--
was
formed,
the
situation
in
the
boxing
industry
was
--
was
roughly
this.
madison
square
garden
is
a
formal
sports
arena
in
the
united
states,
if
not
the
world.
it
was
the
center
of
the
boxing
industry.
it
was
a
place
where
most
of
the
championship
contests
were
held.
at
that
time,
it
worked
with
mike
jacobs
in
the
20th
century
sporting
club.
he
had
an
exclusive
lease
on
the
garden
for
boxing.
and
they
split
with
him
on
a
50-50
basis.
the
only
other
significant
promotional
group
at
that
time
was
the
tournament
of
champions
which
was
partly
owned
by
the
columbia
broadcasting
system.
they
had
promoted
two
middleweight
championship
fights
earlier
that
year.
they
were
planning
to
promote
some
additional
ones.
they
have
an
exclusive
lease
on
the
polo
grounds.
now,
out
in
the
middle
west,
where
norris
and
wirtz,
two
businessmen
of
very
substantial
interests,
norris
was
in
the
crane
business.
he
was
a
stockbroker.
wirtz
was
a
real
estate
man.
as
far
--
at
that
time,
their
relationship
with
the
garden
was
--
was
a
rather
insubstantial
one.
it's
true
they
owned
some
shares
of
stock.
they
owned
between
50,000
out
of
a
total
of
over
500
some
odd
thousand,
less
than
10%.
the
defendants
themselves
recognized
that
in
1949
before
this
conspiracy,
norris
and
wirtz
were
not
officers
of
the
garden.
they
were
not
directors
of
the
garden.
they
exercise
no
control
over
the
garden.
they
didn't
even
actively
participate
in
the
management
of
the
garden.
they
were
out
and
lived
in
chicago.
they
owned
and
controlled
the
chicago
stadium,
the
detroit
olympia
and
the
st.louis
arena
which
were
the
largest
stadium
in
those
cities
available
for
boxing
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
boxing
activities
there
were
only
occasional,
not
very
profitable.
now,
the
conspiracy
here
had
its
inception
in
an
agreement
which
was
made
by
norris
and
wirtz
on
the
one
hand,
and
joe
louis,
who
was
then
heavyweight
champion,
in
january
of
1949.
louis
at
that
time
was
heavily
in
debt,
namely
to
the
government
for
unpaid
taxes
and
he
was
getting
on
in
years
and
his
lawyer,
a
man
named
truman
gibson
conceived
of
a
scheme
whereby
joe
louis
could
secure
some
income
for
himself
without
engaging
in
any
further
boxing.
and
then
went
to
norris
and
wirtz
and
as
a
result
of
that,
an
agreement
which
--
substantive
at
which
is
in
finding
107
on
page
567
of
the
record
was
made
between
louis
on
the
one
hand
and
norris
and
wirtz
on
the
other.
now,
under
that
agreement,
louis
agreed
that
he
would
secure
exclusive
agreements
with
the
--
then
for
a
leading
heavyweight
contenders,
ezzard
charles,
walcott,
lesnevich
and
savold.
these
four
who
were
the
potential
successors
to
the
crown
would
enter
into
agreements
with
louis,
giving
him
the
exclusive
right
to
promote
their
fights,
with
exclusive
radio,
television,
and
motion
picture
rights.
louis
would
then
resign
or
retire
his
heavyweight
champion
of
the
world.
he
would
then
assign
to
these
four
exclusive
contracts
which
he
had
with
these
contenders
to
norris
and
wirtz.
he
would
get
a
salary
of
$15,000
a
year,
some
stock
in
the
corporation
to
be
formed
by
norris
and
wirtz,
and
$150,000.
and
that
agreement
was
carried
out.
louis
got
those
contracts.
he
retired
as
champion.
he
had
signed
those
contracts
to
norris
and
wirtz.
now,
as
a
result
of
that
agreement
as
the
district
court
specifically
found
on
finding
116
on
page
579,
norris
and
wirtz
in
march
1949
were
in
the
position
to
promote
boxing
context
--
contest
which
the
heavyweight
championship
title
would
be
at
stake.
they
had
in
effect
cornered
the
market
on
hip
on
the
heavyweight
championship.
and
unlike
the
position
they
were
in
a
year
before
when
they
were
outside
this
industry,
they
were
--
they
had
acquired
a
dominant
commanding
preclusion
particularly
because
of
the
fact
that
mike
jacobs
was
then
in
florida.
and
as
mr.
general
royall
pointed
out
was
mortally
ill.
now,
norris
--
the
norris-wirtz
group,
after
getting
this
agreement
with
joe
louis,
then
proposed
to
the
madison
square
garden
corporation
and
to
its
president
general
kilpatrick
that
they
worked
together
and
not
create
a
--
create
a
top
competitive
situation
that
would
be
harmful
to
all.
they
are
particularly
worried
about
the
impending
competition
from
the
columbia
broadcasting
system,
the
tournament
of
champions
which
was
showing
--
which
had
fast
capital
resources
and
was
showing
an
interest
in
taking
over
the
promotion
of
boxing
in
order
to
put
it
on
television.
now,
norris
and
wirtz
and
kilpatrick,
and
the
directors
of
the
garden,
these
were
on
opposite
side,
norris
and
wirtz
were
not
on
a
garden
side
of
these
negotiations.
they
are
representing
themselves.
they
negotiated
and
according
to
finding
122
on
page
580
on
may
5th,
1949,
they
arrived
in
an
agreement
to
combine
and
join
forces.
as
a
result
of
the
agreement,
common
boards
of
directors
consisting
of
wirtz-norris,
louis
and
kilpatrick
and
ned
irish,
an
official
of
the
garden
were
designated
for
these
two
corporations
that
had
been
set
up
by
norris
and
wirtz,
the
i.b.c.s,
international
boxing
club
of
new
york,
international
boxing
club
of
illinois.
the
terms
of
the
agreement
set
out
in
finding
125
on
the
same
page,
wirtz
and
norris
would
get
80%
of
the
profits
of
i.b.c.
illinois,
the
garden
would
get
80%
of
the
profits
of
new
york.
joe
louis
would
get
20%.
championship
contest
would
be
allocated
between
the
i.b.c.,
two-thirds
to
i.b.c
in
new
york,
one-third
to
i.b.c
in
illinois.
finding
126
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
execution
of
this
agreement,
the
garden
had
to
buy
up
it's
--
the
exclusive
lease
that
had
with
mike
jacobs.
mike
jacobs
also
had
an
exclusive
arrangement
with
yankee
stadium.
he
also
had
an
exclusive
contract
with
the
then
welterweight
champion
ray
robin
--
sugar
ray
robinson,
one
of
boxing's
all-time
greats
and
an
exceptional
box
office
figure.
now,
that
was
--
that
the
garden
did
that.
mr.
jacobs
was
eliminated.
the
garden
took
over
--
took
over
his
rights
to
the
yankee
stadium
and
this
exclusive
contract
with
robinson
and
with
anyone
else
that
they
wanted
to
have.
then
so
far
as
the
tournament
of
champions
was
concerned,
the
district
court
found
that
pursuant
to
this
agreement,
the
group
bought
up
the
right
of
tournament
of
champions
to
lease
the
polo
grounds.
they
bought
up
all
their
assets
including
the
exclusive
contract
which
that
group
had
with
the
then
middleweight
champion,
marcel
cerdan.
now,
as
a
result
of
all
these
activities,
you
had
this
group
in
may
of
1949
in
control
of
the
key
stadia
and
arenas
throughout
the
east.
they
had
madison
square
garden
in
new
york
at
yankee
stadium.
they
had
the
polo
grounds.
they
had
the
st.
nicholas
arena
which
mike
jacobs
also
had.
they
have
the
chicago
stadium,
detroit
olympia
and
st.louis
arena.
they
had
all
the
key
stadia
as
the
district
court
characterized
them.
they
also
had
the
heavyweight
championship
under
control
be
--
by
reason
of
their
assignment
from
joe
louis.
they
had
the
welterweight
championship
exclusive
rights.
they
also
have
the
middleweight
championship
exclusive
rights.
the
testimony
of
judge
norris
which
judge
ryan
--
the
testimony
of
mr.
norris
which
judge
ryan
incorporated
in
his
findings
was
that
that
--
the
i.b.c.'s
had
a
regular
practice
of
entering
into
so-called
contingent
exclusive
contract
with
everyone
who
wanted
a
shot
at
the
championship
title.
any
contender
who
wanted
to
fight
with
the
title
had
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
them
giving
them
exclusive
rights
to
promote
any
contest
in
the
event
that
he
won.
now,
judge
ryan
said
that
this
was
--
this
finding
164,
the
defendant's
practice
of
so
obtaining
such
contracts
served
as
a
device
for
perpetuating
their
control
of
professional
world
championship
contest
as
the
title
pass
from
one
boxer
to
another.
general
royall
has
said
there's
no
evidence
along
those
lines.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
on
page
195
of
the
record
you
will
explicit
testimony
by
the
manager
of
french
boxer,
(inaudible),
that
he
couldn't
get
a
contract
with
the
champion
unless
he
gave
the
defendants
the
exclusive
promotional
rights
in
the
event
that
he
won
the
championship.
now,
that
was
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
but
i
think
the
relief
question
here
can't
be
considered
in
vacuo.
you
--
you
can't
decide
what
it
is
that
has
to
be
undone
until
you
know
what
was
done
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
spending
so
much
time
on
the
findings
of
fact
which
judge
ryan
had
made
and
on
the
basis
of
which
and
on
the
basis
of
--
on
the
additional
basis
of
the
evidence
which
he
received
from
the
defendants
on
a
supplementary
hearing
in
1957,
he
decided
that
this
decree
was
necessary.
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
while
i
should
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
time
to
the
decree,
i
feel
i
should
say
just
a
few
words
on
the
relevant
marketpoint
in
view
of
the
importance
which
appellants
attached
to
that.
there
again,
there
is
no
disagreement
as
to
the
legal
standard.
both
sides
accepted
the
standard
of
law
that
was
expressed
in
the
du
pont
cellophane
case.
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleged
that
the
heart
of
trade
or
commerce
which
was
involved
here
was
the
promotion
of
world's
championship
boxing
contests.
the
district
court
found
on
the
facts
that
there
was
a
special,
unique
and
distinct
market
as
to
championship
contest
that
ultimate
findings.
in
fact
is
supported
by
numerous
supporting
findings
as
to
the
greater
commercial
appeal
of
championship
fights
for
spectators.
there's
a
finding
that
championship
fights
generated
three
times
the
television,
motion
picture
and
radio
revenue
and
five
times
the
box
office
revenue.
during
the
four-year
period
of
the
conspiracy,
there
were
some
44,000
fights
throughout
the
country.
only
44
of
those,
one-tenth
of
1%
were
championship
fights
and
yet
that
small
fraction
produced
one-third
of
the
total
gross
revenue
of
all
boxing.
the
--
there
was
testimony
by
television
sponsors
and
their
advertising
agency
executives.
there's
testimony
by
the
former
chairman
of
the
national
boxing
association,
mr.
abe
greene,
that
a
championship
fight,
a
fight
is
--
is
entirely
different
from
the
ordinary
fight
where
two
men
are
fighting
each
other
and
when
a
champ
--
when
the
championship
for
the
world
is
involved,
when
the
winner
of
the
fight
is
officially
proclaimed
by
a
government
agency
that
he
is
the
champion
of
the
world
and
can
defeat
any
man
his
size
and
weight
in
the
whole
world,
somehow
that
invests
the
contest
with
a
quality
that
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of.
it's
--
the
same
phenomenon
occurs
every
year,
the
first
week
in
october
when
the
world
series
in
baseball
was
played.
people
who
aren't
interested
in
baseball
during
the
season,
for
some
reason
become
excited
about
the
world
series
because
a
championship
is
involved,
and
that
has
tremendous
commercial
implications.
the
television
sponsors,
well,
one
of
them
the
pabst
brewing
company
paid
$200,000
for
the
right
to
televise
the
joe
louis-ezzard
charles
fight.
it
paid
the
motion
--
for
the
motion
picture
rights
$100,000
for
championship
fight.
there
was
no
market
at
all
for
the
motion
picture
rights
for
the
non-championship
fights.
now,
you
have
all
these
findings
as
to
the
nature
of
the
business.
you
have
findings
as
to
the
vast
differences,
the
amount
of
money
that
was
produced.
and
perhaps,
more
significant
than
anything
else,
the
defendants
themselves
recognized
that
distinction
because
they
concentrated
their
activities
in
the
championship
field.
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
aspects
of
the
conspiracy,
of
course,
they're
engaged
in
the
promotion
of
non-championship
fights,
but
the
arrangements
between
themselves,
the
--
the
agreement
to
split
the
profits
between
the
illinois
and
the
new
york
group
was
at
--
were
only
at
the
championship
fights.
the
--
these
exclusive
contracts
which
they
entered
into
with
contenders
were
not
--
were
not
applicable
in
case
the
--
the
contender
lost.
they
--
they
were
concerned
only
about
his
winning.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
he
became
the
champion
then
they'd
have
the
exclusive
promotional
rights.
and
similarly,
the
territorial
allocation
as
to
where
the
fights
would
be
--
would
be
held,
that
applied
only
to
championship
fights.
now,
on
the
basis
of
all
that,
we
--
we
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
any
basis
on
which
the
finding
of
fact,
and
it's
a
factual
question,
can
be
set
aside
as
clearly
erroneous.
and
i
shall
therefore
pass
on
immediately
to
the
--
to
the
relief.
now,
the
district
court
had,
as
i
say,
in
march
of
1956,
entered
his
findings
of
fact
as
to
the
violations
of
law,
the
restraints
of
trade,
the
monopoly
and
the
monopolistic
power
that
exclude
competitors
which
the
defendants
enjoy.
proposed
--
proposed
forms
of
final
judgment
were
submitted
by
the
parties
in
april
of
1957.
the
government
and
the
defendants
submitted
their
--
their
proposals,
the
defendants
requested
a
hearing.
and
i
--
i
misspoke
myself
before
the
lunch
recess,
i
--
i
said
there
were
9000
pages,
that
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue,
it
was
900
pages.
the
hearings
covered
a
period
of
nine
trial
days
and
the
purpose
of
the
hearings,
which
the
court
expressly
stated
and
i
think
i
should
refer
to
--
to
that
in
view
of
general
royall's
observation
that
--
that
the
district
judge
disregarded
the
existing
conditions.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
pages
769
and
774
of
the
record,
you
will
find
judge
ryan
saying
why
he
was
having
these
hearings
on
the
relief
that
he
wanted
to
go
into
all
the
existing
conditions.
he
wanted
to
know
what
the
defendants
and
the
government
had
to
say
as
to
the
fairness
and
the
reasonableness
and
the
feasibility
of
the
proposals
for
--
for
the
relief.
now,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
practice
he
followed
was
not
of
reserving
judgment
until
the
last
day.
he
expressed
his
mind
openly
as
he
went
along
and
he
changed
his
mind
as
he
went
along
in
the
light
of
--
of
his
preoccupation
with
the
case
and
his
being
immersed
in
--
in
the
record.
and
what
finally
emerged,
as
i
also
said,
was
a
judgment
which
was
not
proposed
in
toto
by
either
side.
it
was
a
composite.
parts
came
from
the
government,
parts
came
from
the
defendant,
part
defendants
and
part
--
one
significant
part,
the
compulsory
leasing
part
initiated
with
the
judge
was
adopted
by
the
defense
and
that's
in
--
in
the
decree.
let
me
refer
to
the
opinion
which
he
delivered
from
the
bench
on
june
24th,
1957,
which
is
in
the
record,
starting
at
page
891
in
volume
2
in
which
he
explains
why
the
relief
that
he
grants
is
necessary
and
--
and
proper
in
view
of
the
findings
and
the
evidence
that
he
had
--
had
presented
to
him.
he
states,
at
the
bottom
of
page
891,
that
the
conspiracy
which
he
found
to
be
existing
was
made
effective
by
the
concert
of
action
of
the
defendants.
the
combination
was
the
source
of
the
monopolistic
power
which
they
had
acquired
and
exercised.
he
said,
at
page
891,
what
he
had
earlier
said
through
--
in
the
course
of
the
hearings
that
there
must
be
a
dissolution
of
that
combination
in
order
to
reestablish
the
competitive
conditions
which
existed
in
1949
before
the
combination
was
established
and
to
permit
the
entry
of
others
into
the
market.
that
was
the
core
of
the
case
as
it
appeared
to
judge
ryan.
it
was
the
fact
that
norris
and
wirtz
who
had
been
in
chicago
would,
as
a
practical
matter,
have
been
outside
of
the
--
of
the
garden
boxing
picture
in
1949,
who
had
held
only
10%
of
the
stock
in
the
garden
and
who
had
not
exercised
any
control
or
participating
in
its
management,
who
had
been
directors
or
officers
in
norris
and
wirtz
by
reason
of
this
combination
had
become
directors
of
the
garden.
norris
became
the
president
of
the
-
of
the
madison
square
garden
corporation.
they
increased
their
stockholdings
from
50,000
shares
prior
to
1949
to
well
over
200,000
shares
in
1955,
a
38%
stock
interest.
there
was
no
question
that
norris
and
wirtz,
during
the
period
of
this
conspiracy,
had
acquired
control
of
the
--
of
the
garden
corporation.
that
they
were
now
directors
of
the
corporation.
and
norris,
as
i
say,
was
--
had
become
the
leading
spirit
in
--
in
the
group.
and
what
had
seemed
to
judge
ryan
to
be
absolutely
essential
was
to
get
norris
and
wirtz
out
of
the
garden
picture
to
try
to
get
the
situation
if
it
could
possibly
be
done
back
to
where
it'd
been
in
1949.
he
also
wanted
--
he
wanted
the
decree
to
encourage
others
to
come
into
the
picture,
other
independents
to
undertake,
to
compete,
if
they
could
with
--
with
the
garden
and
with
norris
and
wirtz.
he
rejected
the
suggestion
which
came
almost
on
the
eve
of
the
decree
that
the
garden
give
up
championship,
give
up
boxing
entirely
because
from
the
judge's
point
of
view
that
would
have
eliminated
the
most
important
potential
independent
promoter
of
boxing.
there
was
the
garden,
the
big
--
the
big
factor
in
the
boxing
picture.
and
to
remove
it
from
--
from
boxing
would
leave
norris
and
wirtz
still
in
--
still
in
the
--
in
the
scene
and
the
garden
would
be
out.
and
--
and
from
judge
ryan's
point
of
view,
he
wanted
to
keep
the
garden
in
the
business,
not
exclude
it
from
the
business,
but
he
wanted
to
have
the
garden
remain
in
--
in
boxing
free
from
the
control
which
norris
and
wirtz
had
acquired
during
the
period
of
this
conspiracy.
and
that's
the
main
thing
in
this
case.
and
he
--
and
i
could
give
your
honors
record
references
to
the
places
throughout
the
hearings
on
the
relief
where
judge
ryan
says
again
and
again,
“what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
get
norris
and
wirtz
back
to
chicago,
get
the
situation
back
to
where
it
was
in
1949,
break
up
this
combination.”
and
all
the
provisions
of
the
decree
have
to
be
examined
as
against
that
central
purpose.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
if
--
so
long
as
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
reason
--
the
reason
why
they
are
taken
out
of
the
garden
is
that
their
entry
into
the
garden
was
the
combination,
it
was
the
combination
of
these
two
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
economic
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
economic
entities.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
elman
1949,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
elman
this
was
1949.
the
toolson
case
--
toolson
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
toolson
case
--
the
toolson
case
was
1953
for
one
thing.
for
another
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
for
another
--
mr.
philip
elman
which
was
a
baseball
decision.
mr.
philip
elman
i
hope
i
don't
have
to
reargue
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
boxing
case
that
was
[laughs]
before
your
honor's
(inaudible)
mr.
philip
elman
well,
there
may
--
there
may
very
well
have
been
some
people
who
thought
that
the
--
the
boxing
contest
itself
was
not
trade
or
commerce,
but
i
can
hardly
subscribe
to
the
view,
your
honor,
that
--
that
any
responsible
lawyer
actually
thought
that
a
scheme
for
the
exclusive
acquisition
of
television
motion
picture
rights
and
all
that
was
--
was
completely
immune
from
that
sherman
act.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
agree
it's
a
different
story.
and
the
story
--
the
story
that
i'm
trying
to
present
here
is
that
the
answer
to
your
question
as
to
the
dissolution
of
this
combination
really
rests
--
it
has
two
aspects,
one,
the
facts
and
two,
the
law.
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
there
is
really
no
problem.
this
court
has
said,
we
quote
on
page
45
of
our
brief
from
the
crescent
amusement
case,
“the
dissolution
of
a
combination
will
be
ordered
where
the
creation
of
the
combination
is
itself
a
violation.”
mr.
philip
elman
i
could
also
cite
the
--
the
paramount
case,
the
--
and
other
cases
that
are
--
that
are
familiar
to
the
--
the
court.
mr.
philip
elman
certainly.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
your
honor,
thereto,
i
--
i
must
express
a
caveat
from
our
point
of
view.
from
our
point
of
view,
the
function
of
an
antitrust
decree
is
not
punitive,
it's
not
to
punish
them.
if
it
were
punitive,
then
you'd
consider
the
question
of
willfulness
and
moral
culpability.
the
function
of
an
antitrust
decree
is
prophylactic,
it's
to
prevent
this
thing
from
happening
again.
mr.
philip
elman
and
then
it
make
--
from
that
point
of
view,
it
makes
no
difference
what
they
thought.
mr.
philip
elman
and
the
state
of
health
that
judge
--
judge
ryan
found
here
on
adequate
evidence
was
that
there
was
an
illegal
monopoly,
a
monopoly
which
was
created
by
the
merger
of
these
two
groups.
and
so
long
as
those
two
groups
continued
to
be
one,
you
could
have
no
competition
between
them.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
you
--
you
--
all
you
--
all
you
--
mr.
philip
elman
he
--
he
did
not
say
this
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
he
didn't.
he
was
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
talking
about
dissolution
of
i.b.c.
mr.
philip
elman
he
was
not
talking
about
the
divestiture
of
their
madison
square
garden
stock
by
norris
and
wirtz.
so
far
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
as
norris
and
wirtz
were
concerned,
what
judge
--
what
the
district
court
here
considered
to
be
controlling,
what
we
consider
to
be
controlling
is
that
so
long
as
norris
and
wirtz
control
the
garden,
you
won't
have
any
--
any
real
possibility
for
the
reentry
of
new
independent
competitors
and
you
won't
have
any
competition
as
between
norris
and
wirtz,
the
chicago
stadium
and
these
other
--
other
mid-western
groups
on
the
one
hand
and
the
garden
on
the
other.
mr.
philip
elman
and
no
restraints
as
to
what
the
garden
should
or
shouldn't
do
could
--
could
accomplish
the
purpose
of
getting
them
the
same
purpose
that
would
be
accomplished
by
getting
them
out
of
the
garden
completely.
mr.
philip
elman
of
course,
there's
a
difference.
but
--
but
the
only
way
you
could
get
them
out
of
control
was
to
require
them
to
divest
themselves
of
what
made
that
control
possible.
mr.
philip
elman
the
divestiture
--
the
divestiture
was
quite
simple.
if
--
if
the
judge
is
right
in
thinking
that
--
that
norris
and
wirtz
had
to
be
removed
from
the
garden
picture,
what
he
did
was
certainly
the
way
to
do
it.
mr.
philip
elman
he
required
them
to
resign
immediately
as
office
directors
and
officers.
he
--
he
had
them
turn
over
their
stock
to
trustees
for
the
purpose
of
holding.
he
gave
them
five
years
in
which
to
sell
it.
and
--
and
on
terms
that
they,
themselves,
could
--
could
require,
this
is
listed
on
the
open
market,
there
was
a
witness
in
the
case
here
who
said
he
--
he
was
ready,
able
and
willing
to
buy
the
--
the
madison
square
garden
stock
open
up
the
norris
and
wirtz
owned
at
the
market
price,
there's
no
problem
as
to
that.
but
he
--
the
judge
gave
them
five
years.
he
gave
them
an
--
an
additional
two
years
in
the
event
that
they
couldn't
sell
it.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
now,
let's
get
--
now,
let's
get
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
back
to
the
corporation.
no,
no.
now,
we're
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
talking
about
the
corporation,
we're
talking
about
two
different
things.
the
garden
is
not
being
dissolved.
the
garden
is
going
to
continue
to
be
there
and
judge
ryan
wants
to
straightened
and
make
it
an
--
an
independent
agent.
that's
the
garden.
now,
the
i.b.c.'s
are
something
entirely
different.
that
these
two
corporations,
international
boxing
club
of
new
york
and
the
international
boxing
club
of
--
of
illinois
part
--
were
recreated.
in
1949,
immediately
after
this
agreement
with
joe
louis.
now,
what
did
--
what
did
they
do
as
the
judge
found?
he
found
that
they
were
essentially
paperbookkeeping
organizations.
they
--
they
serve
no
useful
purpose
except
to
serve
as
the
device
for
funneling
profits
as
between
the
chicago
group
and
the
new
york
group.
he
found
that
they
have
nominal
assets,
no
assets.
now,
his
initial
reaction
to
the
proposal
for
dissolution
of
the
i.b.c.
was
--
he
was
requiring
to
commit
harry
caray,
that's
what
he
said.
that's
what
he
said
on
may
20th.
on
june
--
on
june
20th
--
on
may
29th,
record
page
821
after
he
had
heard
some
evidences
to
what
the
i.b.c.'s
were
doing
and
what
the
function
they
serve,
he
said,
“well,
he's
--
i'm
reluctantly
heading
in
the
direction
of
dissolution,”
that's
on
page
821.
on
june
28th,
he
engages
in
the
colluqoy
with
mr.
elkins,
one
of
the
trial
counsel
for
the
government.
mr.
elkins
says
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
the
dissolution
of
the
i.b.c.'s
is
not
a
substantial
part
of
the
--of
the
government's
remedy.
they
don't
particularly
care
about
it.
the
--
the
main
reason
for
asking
the
dissolution
of
these
i.b.c.s
was
to
service
as
a
convenient
way
of
--
of
eliminating
these
contingent
exclusive
contracts
that
i.b.c.
had
entered
into
with
the
--
with
the
competitors
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
those
are
--
they're
enjoined
and
they're
declared
invalid.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that's
--
that's
why
it's
very
difficult,
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
to
see
what
the
shooting
is
about
because
as
judge
ryan
said
and
mr.
general
royall
has
repeated
here,
there's
nothing
in
this
decree
that
prevents
the
parties
from
forming
new
corporations
tomorrow.
one
called
international
boxing
club
madison
square
garden,
international
boxing
club
of
chicago
stadium.
those
corporations
could
continue
to
perform
the
function
of
--
of
promoting
the
bouts,
making
the
contracts
to
the
boxers
and
so
on.
that
--
that
function
continues
--
will
certainly
be
continued
as
to
nonchampionship
fights
and
as
to
these
two
--
mr.
philip
elman
pardon?
mr.
philip
elman
oh,
yes,
yes.
to
the
extent
of
defendant's
control
these
new
corporations
are,
of
course,
be
found
by
them.but
consider
this
as
--
as
a
separate
independent
provision
of
the
decree,
the
dissolution
of
these
paper
organizations
is
really
just
a
paper
act.
mr.
philip
elman
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it's
not
useless.
mr.
philip
elman
the
use?
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
useful
purpose
--
the
--
in
the
first
place,
the
reason
why
they
were
dissolved,
ordered
dissolved
by
the
--
by
the
judge
is
a
reason
which
--
which
has
a
--
a
sound
legal
basis.
these
were
instrumentalities
created
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
the
conspiracy.
and
--
and
it's
certainly
abundant
law,
which
i
need
not
cite
to
your
honors,
as
to
the
adequacy
and
appropriateness
of
--
of
eliminating
the
devices
for
carrying
--
for
carrying
out
conspiracy.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that
--
that
goes
only
to
the
claim
that
this
is
harsh
and
drastic.
the
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
burden
of
--
of
showing
that
this
provision
of
the
decree
should
be
eliminated,
rest
upon
the
defendant
who
has
been
found
to
have
violated
the
law
and
who
says
this
decree
really
goes
much
further
than
necessary.
it
seems
to
what
it
all
adds
up
to
is
this
doesn't
amount
to
very
much,
it
doesn't
hurt
them
and
perhaps
it
doesn't
serve
very
much
of
a
purpose.
now,
we
think
it
serves
a
--
a
useful
purpose
in
that
it's
a
kind
of
a
shorthand
way
of
wiping
out
all
of
these
unexecuted
contract
arrangements
which
are
--
which
were
declared
illegal
in
the
--
in
the
other
portion
of
the
decree.
so
that
you
can
now
start
from
scratch.he
--
the
judge
is
wiping
the
slate
clean
and
saying,
“well,
let's
--
let's
eliminate
these
corporations.”
that
seems
to
be
perfectly
reasonable
proper
and
--
and
it's
hard
to
see
who's
hurt
by
it.
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't.
mr.
philip
elman
i
didn't
say
it
was
harsh.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that
was
his
--
that
was
his
first
reaction
when
he
read
it.
mr.
philip
elman
that
--
that's
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
when
it
came
to
the
--
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
states,
it's
true
that
judge
ryan
said
he
wanted
this
--
this
decree
to
be
presented
to
this
court
before
it
was
made
effective
which
is
certainly
justifiable.
mr.
philip
elman
but
it
--
it's
a
big
jump
to
go
from
that
to
say
that
he
conceded
that
this
--
he
didn't
--
he
certainly
didn't
say
at
the
time
he
entered
the
decree
that
there
was
anything
harsh
or
drastic
or
punitive
about
it.
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
he
was
referring
to
the
dissolution.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
--
i
don't
think
--
yes,
i
think
he
was
referring
to
his
own
--
his
own
proposal
for
compulsory
leasing
of
the
arenas.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
now,
i
think
that's
what
he
was
thinking.
if
that
was
the
one
that
he
brought
in
to
the
case
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
it
is
true
there
are
no
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it's
a
relevant
--
there
was
the
argument
of
irrelevant
market.
and
at
that
time,
it
was
--
the
--
the
law
was
somewhat
uncertain
in
view
of
the
division
in
the
court
and
so
on.
there
was
--
there
was
--
a
district
judge
in
that
situation
would
naturally
want
this
court
to
pass
on
his
decree
before
putting
in
to
effect.
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
that
that
--
that
supports
the
--
the
suggestion
that
after
he
had
gone
through
this
process
of
weighing
and
pondering
and
deliberating
of
it,
that
at
that
time,
he
thought
he
was
doing
something
that
went
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
situation
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
well,
there
are
five
--
there
are
five
phases
of
the
decree.
mr.
philip
elman
one
is
dissolution
of
the
i.b.c.
i
think
i've
said
all
i
can
say
on
that.
mr.
philip
elman
divestiture,
and
i
think
that's
been
covered.
there's
compulsory
leasing
of
the
stadium,
the
madison
square
garden
and
the
chicago
stadium.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that
--
that
provision
in
--
is
--
as
i
say,
is
drafted
by
the
defendants
and
it
says
--
it
says,
“where
--
where
an
independent
promoter
comes
to
the
garden
on
a
night
which
is
otherwise
available
and
asked
that
he
read
it,
if
there's
any
disagreement
as
to
what
the
reasonable
terms
of
the
rental,
the
court
will
resolve
that
disagreement.”
now,
that
was
there
proposal
and
it
seems
difficult
to
understand
why
we
should
now
object
to
it.
mr.
philip
elman
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
judge
--
the
judge
had
indicated
that
he
wouldn't
go
for
that.
the
government
had
proposed
that
--
that
the
defendants,
in
effect,
be
put
out
of
the
business
of
promoting
championship
boxing
permanently.
and
the
judge
said
that
that
was
too
--
that
was
too
extreme.
he
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
do
that.
and
he
--
he
thought
he
would
go
along
with
the
defendants'
proposal
that
they
remain
in
the
business
of
promoting
championship.
mr.
philip
elman
the
defendants
had
originally
proposed
that
they
be
limited
to
two
championship
fights
each
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
per
year.
mr.
philip
elman
the
judge
said
to
the
government,
“i'm
going
to
approve
that
proposal
of
the
defendants
and
i'm
not
going
to
approve
your
proposal
that
they
be
barred
from
--
from
the
championship
boxing.”
he
also
said
to
the
--
to
the
party
after
he
had
heard
this
testimony
from
mr.
(inaudible)
about
the
need
for
giving
the
independent
promoters
a
break
and
letting
them
have
an
opportunity
to
get
into
the
garden,
he
said,
“i
think,
i
--
he
said,
“i
--
i
--
it
seems
to
me,”
he
said,
“these
cases
on
the
licensing
of
patents
at
reasonable
royalties
give
us
--
are
analogous
here
and
i
think
i've
got
the
power
to
direct
them
to
enter
into
these
leasing
arrangements
with
independent
promoters”.
now
at
that
stage,
the
defendants,
far
from
objecting
to
his
idea
of
compulsory
leasing,
embrace
their
proposal.
they
submitted
to

submitted
that
proposal
as
to
compulsory
leasing
--
leasing
in
their
proposed
decree.
that's
on
page
61
of
the
record,
your
honor,
you
will
find
that
page.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
they
were
--
they
were
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
government
submitted
its
proposal
as
to
relief
april
8th,
1957.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
in
their
printed
record
volume
2,
page
602.
that
provided
through
divestiture
within
six
months,
permanent
injunction
against
championship
contest,
dissolution,
no
provision
is
compulsory
leasing
and
so
on.
the
defendants
submitted
theirs
two
weeks
later
on
april
22nd.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
r-608.
and
the
--
the
proposal
that
i'm
referring
to,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
they
submitted
--
this
was
their
proposed
judgment
as
modified
on
may
29th,
1957.
it's
in
the
record
at
618,
begins
at
618
and
number
616.
my
--
my
notes
say
618.
and
the
compulsory
leasing
provision
is
on
page
621.
now,
that's
divestiture
dissolution
compulsory
leasing.
the
limitation
--
the
fourth
of
the
five
aspects
of
the
relief
is
a
limitation
on
promotion
of
championship
bouts
to
two
a
year.
that's
--
then
its
proposal,
they
said
that
that's
adequate,
certainly
no
contests
for
that.now,
the
final
point
which
they
make
is
the
provision
which
bans
the
exclusive
contracts
with
boxers
and
the
provision
which
bans
the
exclusive
leasing
of
stadia
extends
not
only
the
championship
fights
but
also
applies
to
all
fights.
now,
why
did
judge
ryan
make
it
as
broad
as
that?
he
gives
us
his
reasons
on
page
896
of
the
record
in
his
opinion.
he
says,
“the
relief
here
must
be
broader
than
the
championship
field
because
the
evil
to
be
remedied
is
broader
by
terminating
all
exclusive
contracts
and
leases,
then
joining
them
in
the
future,
the
way
will
be
open
for
those
who
wish
and
have
the
financial
ability
and
otherwise
meet
local
and
state
requirements
to
enter
into
the
promotion
of
championship
boxing
contest.”
in
other
words
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
it
was
--
it
was
much
milder.
the
government
proposed
divestiture
in
six
months.
it
--
it
proposed
--
the
other
major
feature
of
the
government's
proposal
was
that
the
defendants
be
completely
removed
from
promotion
of
championship
boxing.
now,
the
--
the
judge
substantially
modified
the
divestiture
provision
as
--
in
terms
of
the
time.
he
cut
down
the
ban
on
their
promotion
to
two
a
year.
now,
the
--
the
finding
was
that
they're
only
between
9
to
13
championship
fights
a
year.
so
he
allowed
them
to
stay
in
--
as
to
four
within
a
year
which
still
gives
them
a
substantial
piece
of
the
business.
and
he
wanted
to
keep
them
in.
he
didn't
want
to
drive
them
out
of
this.
he
--
he
recognized
that
once
competition
was
--
was
restored,
their
--
their
capital,
their
know-how
and
so
on
could
be
put
to
good
use.
now,
that
--
that
--
it's
--
now,
summing
it
all
up,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
essentially
a
fact
case.
the
--
it's
--
it's
governed
by
familiar
principles
which
have
been
declared
as
to
the
respect
to
be
attached
to
the
findings
of
fact,
respect
to
be
attached
to
the
exercise
of
judgment
made
by
the
man
who
devoted
months
to
considering
the
problems
that
your
honors
have
had
presented
to
you
in
this
--
in
this
afternoon,
who
had
this
record.
he
had
more
than
the
printed
record.
he
had
--
he
had
ample
time
and
--
and
resources
to
go
over
the
case.
we
think
that
what
he
did
here
was
consistent
with
the
--
with
the
standard
that's
applied
in
to
trust
cases.
you
got
the
evils.
the
--
the
--
its
function
is
not
merely
to
remove
the
evils
but
to
restore
and
create
condition
which
will
prevent
recurrence
of
those
evils.
