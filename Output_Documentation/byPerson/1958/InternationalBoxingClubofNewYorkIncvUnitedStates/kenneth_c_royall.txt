mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
boxing.
it's
on
appeal
from
the
--
by
defendants
in
the
judgment
--
judgment
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
an
action
under
section
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
district
court
found
an
actual
monopoly,
not
an
intent
to
monopolize
and
a
relief
was
based
on
this
finding.

mr.
charles
sawyer's
firm
represents
the
chicago
stadium,
the
i.b.c.of

and
mrs.arthur
wirtz
and
james
norris.
i've
been
requested
to
present
the
case
for
all
the
defendants.
now,
the
three
of
the
usual
questions
proposed
in
this
case
to
the
championship
bouts
that
is
distinguished
from
all
the
professional
box
constitute
in
themselves
a
relevant
market.
and
second,
if
so,
is
there
a
violation
shown
of
the
antitrust
law.
finally,
if
both
market
and
violation
should
be
established,
is
--
are
there
relief
provisions
proper
or
are
they
punitive,
oppressive,
and
unnecessary?
the
period
covered
by
the
complaints
from
1949
to
1953.
prior
to
that
time,
boxing
on
a
national
scale
had
been
largely
dominated
for
some
years
by
a
tax
record
and
later,
from
1937
to
1948
or
1949
by
mike
jacobs
who
had
a
lease
on
the
madison
square
garden.
in
1948
or
1949,
jacobs
held
had
failed
and
the
he
was
completely
enacted.
a
smaller
boxing
organization,
the
tournament
of
champions
had
started
early
in
1948,
had
declined
almost
to
the
vanishing
point,
was
seeking
to
get
out
of
business
and
salvage
something.
joe
louis,
who
had
held
the
center
of
the
stage
for
a
long
time
was
quitting
his
heavyweight
crown
and
trying
to
arrange
a
series
of
fights
by
others
in
order
to
obtain
some
revenue.
he
was
unable
to
find
a
backup.
professional
world
boxing
was
it,
its
lowest
have
for
many
years
and
was
facing
a
further
decline.
now,
madison
square
garden
was
worried
about
it.
while
boxing
represented
only
6%
of
the
garden
business
and
involved
just
a
smaller
amount
of
its
personnel,
yet
it
did
provide
income
normally
necessary
for
the
garden
to
operate
with
profit.
the
garden
had
a
large
investment.
its
expenses
were
in
one
sense,
enormous
and
it
was
necessary
for
it
to
schedule
and
present
popular
events
covering
a
great
majority
of
the
time
it
had
opened.
they
want
it
and
badly
needed
the
boxing
events
to
continue.
now,
in
1949
and
since
1937,
mrs.wirtz
and
norris
held
a
substantial
block
of
madison
square
garden
stock.
in
fact,
norris'
father
has
been
a
stockholder
for
many,
many
years.
the
chicago
stadium
owned
by
mrs.wirtz
and
norris
had
a
problem
similar
to
the
garden's
problem.
it
had
been
operated
in
a
substantial
loss
and
was
desperately
trying
to
increase
its
revenues.
these
two
gentlemen
also
in
the
detroit
arena
and
in
an
(inaudible)
st.
louis
arena.
incidentally,
before
the
decree
in
the
case,
the
detroit
arena
had
been
sold
and
the
boxing
had
been
abandoned
in
the
st.louis
arena.
wirtz
and
norris
had
owned
the
chicago
stadium
since
1935.
wirtz's
original
activity
was
in
ice
shows
and
other
events.
both
he
and
norris
had
helped
sustain
the
stadium
by
such
events.
and
they
had
helped
to
build
the
garden
by
various
events.
for
them
boxing
was
an
afterthought
designed
to
--
at
that
particular
period
of
the
boxing
history
to
get
the
stadium
into
the
--
on
the
block
side
a
ledger
and
to
help
the
garden
from
losing
to
the
margin
that
it
had.
a
settlement
was
made,
an
agreement
was
made
with
joe
louis.
the
i.b.c.
is
to
organize
as
promoting
organizations.
the
surrender
of
mike
jacobs'
lease
was
purchased
and
the
tournament
of
champions
was
acquired.
the
two
i.b.c.'s
promoted
professional
fights,
championship
and
nonchampionship.
there
was
a
friday
night
series
and
then
a
wednesday
night
series
which
i
think
it's
--
everybody
has
pretty
common
knowledge.
as
a
result
of
this,
there
was
a
revival
in
the
professional
boxing
in
the
garden
and
in
the
united
states
as
a
whole
and
with
other
promoters.
but
the
stadium
continued
to
lose
money.
now,
these
aren't
to
show
under
the
facts
which
led
to
the
agreements
that
are
under
attack
in
this
case.
i
want
to
mention
that
those
agreements
were
made
with
layman,
lawyers,
and
judges,
were
almost
unanimously
to
the
opinion
that
sports
arrangements
of
this
kind
did
not
violate
the
law
under
the
(inaudible)
case.
the
contracts
made
with
other
arenas
by
the
defendants
were
historically
typical
and
nothing
unusual.
the
same
was
true
as
the
well-established
return
bout
agreements
and
three
year
exclusive
contracts
with
boxers.
our
position
on
this
matter
is
more
fully
covered
in
the
brief.
we
say
here
briefly
that
the
agreements
were
made
by
the
defendants
because
necessary
to
say
for
declining
industry
which
industry
in
turn
was
necessary
to
the
continued
operation
of
there
to
expansive
buildings.
no
conducts
of
the
defendants
caused
the
death
for
the
tournament
of
champions.
they
were
seeking
and
unable
to
find
anyone
to
salvage
their
operation.
the
same
is
true
of
the
st.louis
arrangement
and
the
jacob's
contract.
those
people,
louis
and
jacobs
with
the
movements
because
they
were
at
the
end
of
their
road.
there
was
no
previous
boxing
competition
between
the
madison
square
garden
on
the
one
hand,
stadium
on
the
other
or
between
any
of
the
various
defendants.
and
hence
there
was
no
competition
to
lesson
in
this
case
because
none
existed.
the
exclusive
contacts
with
the
boxers
were
for
a
reasonable
period
and
they
were
necessary
for
the
continuity
required
for
the
continuous
operation
of
a
stadium
or
an
arena.
these
agreements
in
turn
protected
the
boxers
themselves.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
not
one
single
word
to
show
that
the
defendants
excluded
from
boxing
any
boxer,
that
they
excluded
a
single
promoter,
or
that
any
--
or
excluded
any
other
stadium,
or
any
television
arrangement,
or
any
radio
or
moving
picture
company.
the
defendants
did
not
own
tv
or
other
tv
time.
at
the
date
of
the
decree,
they
were
negotiating,
that
is
they
did
not
own
over
a
period
of
time.
they
were
negotiating
for
a
contract
which
covered
a
reasonable
continuity
on
this.
there
was
no
monopoly
of
championship
boxing
unless
it
can
arise
solely
from
percentages.
they
did
have
a
large
percent
of
it.
before
the
decree,
the
garden
and
the
stadium
were
losing
their
position,
have
lost
all
their
heavyweight
bouts.
nor
was
there
any
monopoly
on
television.
indecently,
the
sponsors
and
the
advertisers
of
television
are
much
more
powerful
than
either
these
corporations
of
any
of
these
defendants
could
be.
as
to
the
stadium,
the
defendants
at
the
time
with
the
decree
control
only
one
of
the
several
suitable
stadium
in
new
york
and
only
two
out
of
hundreds
suitable
stadiums
in
the
united
states.
and
those
two
that
they
control
so
to
speak
belonged
to
them.
under
these
conditions,
there
is
not
and
could
not
be
any
possible
control
of
price.
now,
that
price
element
was
lamely
brought
into
this
case
in
the
brief
in
this
court
and
never
found
below.
the
prices
as
a
matter
of
fact,
boxing
must
be
reported
to
the
respective
boxing
commissioners
for
their
consideration.
defendants
have
not
restricted
or
restrained
the
boxing
industry.
on
the
contrary,
the
result
of
their
action,
they
have
expanded
the
number
of
good
boxing
contests
with
other
promoters,
have
decreased
the
admission
prices,
have
provided
television
for
millions
of
viewers,
and
it
helped
the
boxers
financially,
and
helped
the
viewing
public.
there
is
no
semblance
of
monopoly
in
--
of
professional
boxing
as
a
whole.
there
are
2000
professional
boxing
programs
in
the
united
states
each
year
involving
almost
20,000
boxers
because
they
have
several
bouts.
the
championship
--
the
non
--
the
--
all
the
--
all
the
boxing
contests
promoted
by
all
the
defendants
at
the
maximum
between
80
and
90
a
year.
in
the
championship
field,
it
is
six
to
eight
a
year.
now,
there
in
our
opinion,
there
is
no
violation
even
if
the
profitable
market
is
a
championship
boxing
market.
but
they
have
sought
the
--
the
government
has
sought
to
post
its
case
to
make
it
stronger
by
picking
out
what
we
say
as
an
artificial
market
that
is
confining
it
to
championship
boxing
and
not
to
all
boxing.
we
say
that
is
wrong.
the
district
court
itself
conceded
that
a
violation
was
dependent
on
that
market
and
that
there
would
be
no
violation
in
any
event
if
the
market
included
professional
boxing.
the
only
distinction
between
the
two,
we
urge
upon
you,
is
a
difference
of
quantity
and
not
of
kind.
within
any
market,
there
are
differences
in
cost,
differences
in
price,
and
quality,
and
acceptance,
and
demand.
if
these
factors
did
not
exist
then
there
would
be
no
competition
possible
in
that
market.
it
takes
those
differences
to
make
competition
conversely.
if
the
existence
of
these
differences
define
a
market
then
conceivably
each
product
in
the
market
could
be
--
each
product
in
the
business
could
be
a
market
because
if
every
factor
were
identical
on
the
theory
--
on
the
theory
proposed
then
there
would
be
a
monopoly
in
one
product.
we
say
that
the
court,
the
district
court
cannot
select
and
define
its
market
just
to
create
a
situation
where
they
can
argue
that
there's
a
violation
of
law.
this
would
rather
be
a
bootstrap
operation.
and
the
cases
they
have
said
starting
with
columbia
steel
that
it's
first
necessary
to
delimit
the
market.
it
is
true
and
the
facts
we
think
are
immaterial.
it
is
true
that
on
the
average,
championship
bouts
have
a
higher
prestige
in
publicity,
a
greater
public
demand
on
the
average,
a
larger
number
of
viewers,
they
bring
in
more
dollars
on
gate
receipts
or
television.
but
that's
just
the
average.
both
championship
and
nonchampionship
fights,
either
classification,
they're
maybe
poor,
they're
maybe
--
fail,
or
they're
maybe
good
and
there
are
differences
in
amount
depending
on
that.
and
there
are
some
better
championship
fights
that
are
larger
in
every
way
than
some
nonchampionship
fights
which
often
occurs
based
on
the
popularity
of
the
participants
in
which
outlays
the
rating,
technical
rating
of
championship.
now
that's
--
that
situation
is
applicable
to
similar
products
of
the
same
business
of
others
in
the
same
field.
there
is
nothing
for
a
--
in
our
case,
there's
nothing
to
show
even
one
that
there
is
a
substantial
audience
for
championship
fights
as
distinguished
from
audience
for
nonchampionship
fights.
there
maybe
more
a
number.
but
the
natural
presumption
is
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
which
states
it,
that
is
undenied.
that
all
who
view
championship
fights,
all
or
maybe
at
one
time
or
another
viewers
of
nonchampionship
fights,
some
nonchampionship
fights.
in
other
words,
the
audience
may
be
more
accumulated
when
it's
a
championship
fight
but
it's
the
same
people.
individual
boxers
start
as
novices.
they
go
up
the
scale.
some
of
them
become
champions.
some
of
the
champions
move
downward
and
some
of
those
that
move
downward
move
up
again.
and
this
testimony
was
given
by
witness
which
was
not
challenged
or
denied
at
all
or
contradicted.
he
said,
"this
is
a
sport
where
boys
are
fighting
for
the
championships."
that
starts
with
the
novice.
"we
are
showing
them
each
week
that
we
can
show
champions,
why
we
want
to
do
so."
and
that
shows
that
the
boxing
--
professional
boxing
is
all
one
market.
both
of
them
timed
with
a
weekly
series,
it
is
wednesday
and
friday
night
and
some
other
promoters
have
other
night
series.
when
there
was
a
championship
fight
in
the
series,
it's
the
main
attraction.
but
when
there
is
not
a
championship
fight
in
the
series
then
some
nonchampionship
fight
is
the
main
attraction.
in
either
case,
the
prestige
of
the
championship
fight
or
the
nonchampionship
fight
contributes
to
the
success
of
the
weekly
series
and
makes
its
continuation
possible.
the
sponsored
--
the
sponsors
who
really
should
know
(inaudible)
of
about
this
matter,
testified
unanimously
that
all
professional
boxing
as
far
as
they
was
concerned
was
one
market.
we
believe
that
the
championship
and
nonchampionship
fights
are
to
a
large
degree
inter
changing.
and
under
the
cellophane
case,
the
market
could
not
be
split
artificially
into
--
cellophane
as
you
gentlemen
will
remember
cost
two
or
three
times
more
than
the
other
products.
and
the
average
--
dollar
averages
go
higher.
but
those
facts
did
not
justify
a
dollar
division
of
the
market.
the
times-picayune
case
was
a
different
--
even
different
readers
read
the
morning
and
the
evening
papers,
yet
this
court
found
that
they
could
not
split
that
market
in
the
morning
and
afternoon
that
it
was
a
relevant
market.
i
suppose
the
general
motors
du
pont
case
which
confined
the
matter
to
paint
products
sold
the
motor
companies
was
one
of
the
most
restrictive
of
the
market
decisions.
but
there,
there
was
no
narrowing
on
the
market
on
the
basis
of
quantity
of
dollars
or
relative
figures.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
basis
in
--
by
inference
ignored
that
distinction
and
made
it
only
on
the
different
customers
which
does
not
arise
in
this
case
and
from
that
case.
this
case
is
clearly
a
distinction.
and
it
is
rather
amusing
in
a
way
that
the
plaintiff
itself
in
writing
his
brief
in
this
case
could
not
refrain
from
disclosing
the
fact
that
in
--
at
least
involuntarily.
they
thought
it
was
a
single
market.
in
page
five
of
their
brief,
the
language
is,
"professional
boxing
including
championship
boxing."
and
on
35,
they
said
the
championship
fights
are
included
within
the
classification
of
good
fights
which
of
course
includes
the
great
men
in
nonchampionship.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
professional
boxing
market
is
a
criterion
and
was
used.
if
so,
admittedly
by
the
court
and
by
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
their
briefs,
this
case
would
have
to
be
dismissed
because
they
did
not
make
--
they
could
not
make,
they
did
not
even
contend,
and
there
of
course
no
finding
that
there's
any
monopoly
of
any
kind
in
the
professional
boxing
industry.
now,
the
--
if
it
should
happen
and
we
of
course
being
passed
and
do
not
see,
it
could
happen.
that
the
questions
of
market
and
violation
were
both
decided
against
us.
then
we
contend
that
the
relief
ordered
by
the
court
is
a
large
part
unnecessary
and
it's
extremely
excessive
and
oppressive,
and
punitive.
we
say
that
the
district
court
despite
its
protestations
to
the
contrary
completely
ignored
the
existing
conditions,
and
i
think
of
reading
of
their
decree
would
almost
disclose
that.
if
those
conditions
included
the
fact
that
there
were
only
two
arenas
out
of
a
hundred
involved
and
a
hundreds
involved
in
this
case
and
that
they
had,
that
defendants
had
no
leases
on
any
others.
it
showed
that
at
time
the
market
was
completely
open
to
promoters
and
other
arenas
and
outside
of
those
of
our
clients.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
other
promoters
were
successfully,
so
successfully,
they
took
the
heavyweight
championship,
and
the
--
they
were
operating.
despite
of
all
this
--
these
existing
facts
and
others,
the
district
court
made
an
order
that
included
both
dissolution
and
divestiture.
dissolution
of
the
i.b.c.'s
which
were
they're
promoting
agencies,
subsidiaries
of
the
stadium.
and
the
judge
did
that
after
he
had
stated
this,
"i
do
not
know
of
any
decree
at
any
time
where
a
corporate
defendant
was
ordered
to
dissolve."
and
he
said
that
with
reference
to
these
same
corporations
which
he
later
ordered
dissolve.
there
is
no
contention
that
that
dissolution
of
those
companies
would
increase
competition.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
specifically
said,
“at
the
time
of
his
decree
that
such
corporations
when
necessary
to
comply
with
the
state
boxing
laws
and
were
necessary
in
the
operation
of
boxing
in
the
stadium.”
that
same
situation
arose
by
--
in
the
case
tried
by
judge
wyzanski,
mentioned
in
our
brief.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
he
said
that
they
were
an
agency
or
an
arm
of
the
monopoly.
but
he
said
at
the
same
time
we
could
organize
exactly
similar
corporations
and
name
them
i.b.c.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
they
--
they
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
they
required
a
domestic
corporation
and
they
preferred
to
have
the
promotion
activities
centered
in
a
single
person.
the
--
the
convenience
and
almost
necessity
of
doing
that
in
dealing
with
people
was
also
unquestioned.
so
much
so
as
i
say
the
judge
said
that
we
could
do
it.
well,
the
only
result
of
that
the
dissolution
would
be
to
cause
inconvenience,
confusion,
and
expense.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
the
judge
made
a
statement
explanatory
of
the
decree
or
at
the
time
he
announced
his
intention
in
which
he
said
that
simultaneously
in
effect.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no.
well,
it's
not
in
the
decree
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
i
--
i
think
you
would
have
to
take
into
account
the
--
the
definite
statement
of
the
judge
made
in
court
that
we
would
be
authorized
to
do
that
and
i
don't
believe
he
would
find
us
in
contempt
because
it
was
a
--
a
printed
record
and
i
don't
think
he
would.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i.b.c.
of
madison
square
garden
is
the
word
the
judge
had
used.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i
would
say,
i
would
advice
that
he
could.
i
would
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
appreciable
risk
because
of
the
statement.
it
don't
matter,
the
statement
the
judge
made.
and
volunteer
--
was
no
ordinary
--
any
--
and
asked
any
inquiry
about.
he
volunteered
that.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
i
don't
think,
show
instrumentalities
is
quite
accurate.
they
did
--
did
not
have
a
large
amount
of
assets.
they
had
personnel.
they
had
contracts,
contracts
of
employment.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
a
very
valuable
goodwill.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
sir.
now
the
--
they
--
now,
then
the
court
started
--
it
ordered
divestiture,
ordered
wirtz
and
norris
to
sell
their
stock
in
the
garden.
his
purpose
as
it
--
as
well
as
it
can
be
gathered
from
his
many
remarks
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
restore
the
parties
to
their
previous
competitive
positions.
the
record
shows
without
contradiction,
the
plaintiff
conceded
that
there
never
had
been
any
competition
between
wirtz
and
norris
in
the
stadium
and
the
--
he
stayed
in
the
madison
square
garden.
and
therefore,
that
reason
had
no
support.
the
--
but
he
also
said
that
the
divestiture
and
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
monopoly
in
the
future.
however,
he
had
already
provided
that
in
his
order
that
the
garden
couldn't
have
a
two
championship
bouts
a
year
and
that
the
stadium
couldn't
have
two
championship
bouts
a
year
which
not
by
inference
but
by
a
direct
and
necessary
order
prevented
the
monopoly.
and
therefore,
that
reason
would
not
stand
up.
now,
the
foresail
of
this
garden
would
greatly
damage
mrs.wirtz
and
norris.
it
is
common
sense
they
have
a
very
substantial
block
stock.
there
is
no
fair
value
that
could
possibly
be
gotten
from
the
stock
with
a
large
block
overhanging
in
their
mind
in
a
closely
held
corporation.
not
only
that,
whatever
stockholder
in
madison
square
garden
who
haven't
--
who
had
no
participation
even
in
the
things
they
alleged
would
find
the
injury
to
his
stock.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
it
is.
i'm
--
i'm
arguing
that
from
inference
that
the
corporation
of
this
kind,
as
i
said,
it
reads
as
common
sense.
i
think
that
must
necessarily
be
true.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
it
is
listed,
yes.
it
is
listed,
but
it's
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
it's
--
they
have
a
big
block.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
it
couldn't
--
it
would
not
sir.
it
would
not
do
so.
but
it
has
only
--
they
are
bound
by
the
--
actually
the
corporations,
no
doubt
about
that.
but
it
--
it
does
land
it
--
i
mean,
it
is
important
on
the
general
justice
of
this
decree.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
in
the
record,
it
shows
38%
of
the
garden
and
later
in
the
decree
they
had
other
--
they
were
asked
to
produce
anything
that
they
thought
they
might
have
any
direct
contact
within
its
realm.
i
think
a
little
over
50%.
now,
they
also
set
up
--
set
up
for
trusteeship
ship
for
the
stock.
the
expense
of
which
was
depending
to
sale
and
to
be
paid
from
dividends
of
wirtz
and
norris.
and
while
the
government
says
it's
a
trifling
financial
burden,
my
experience
with
the
little
things
that
is
to
the
contrary,
and
i
imagine
the
court
has
had
some
experience.
the
wirtz
and
norris
stock
was
acquired
long
before
the
alleged
conspiracy.
none
of
it
was
in
any
sense
of
fraudulent
conspiracy.
none
of
it
was
used
to
force
any
in
the
agreements
made
by
the
garden.
divestiture
also
deprives
them
of
future
profits,
not
only
from
boxing
which
is
only
6%
of
the
business,
whether
it
deprives
them
of
anything
they
could
make
out
on
94%
of
the
operation
in
other
events.
and
i
will
say
--
well,
i
think,
the
apology
that
if
--
decree
could
be
punitive,
that's
a
punitive
decree.
they
had
filled
up
the
garden
in
other
events
long
before
boxing
came.
they're
given
money
and
time
to
doing
it.
the
directors
felt
so
strong
about
it,
with
them
absent
and
no
evidence
that
they
control
the
directors
at
all.
they
state
it
that
in
desperation,
they
would
rather
give
up
championship
boxing
than
to
lose
the
services
of
wirtz
and
norris
in
the
conduct
of
their
other
operations
and
pass
it
by
a
formal
resolution.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no,
sir.
he
gave
us
no
options.
i'm
coming
to
those
in
a
moment.
there
again,
they
decree
would
purchase
all
of
the
--
punish
all
of
stockholder
on
all
these
other
events,
circuses,
flower
shows,
horse
shows,
religious
meetings,
even
political
gatherings.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no.
it
--
it
you
takes
wirtz
and
norris
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
--
out
of
them
and
they
don't
appeal.
the
law
with
the
course
in
years
is
holistic.
madison
square
garden
up
to
what
it
is
today,
the
hard
work
and
intelligence,
and
their
main
effort
has
been
in
matters
other
than
boxing.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
that's
what
that
the
record
said
by
unanimous
holding
excluded.
they
did
not
attend
the
meeting
and
no
evidence
of
any
control
in
that
except
the
spontaneous
statement
from
the
corporation
itself.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
oh,
no
sir.
no,
none
at
all.
they
could
do
it
with
other
the
people.
now,
the
--
then,
they
have
a
composure
leasing
provision
which
would
require
them
to
--
if
an
applicant
came
for
a
boxing
match,
the
court
would
decide
whether
they'd
give
it
even
if
he
took
it
away
from
another
boxing
match
or
if
he
took
it
away
from
a
horse
show
or
if
he
took
it
away
form
anything
else.
in
the
first
place,
that's
a
bad
way
to
run
a
--
to
run
the
district
courts
to
put
them
in
the
operation
of
a
--
of
a
sporting
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
if
there
was
an
applicant
for
a
boxing
match
and
there
were
other
applicants
for
that
time
whether
they
were
boxing
or
anything
else,
it
would
raise
an
issue
which
if
the
--
that
which
could
--
could
--
there
could
be
a
request
the
court
to
determine
to
whom
it
could
be
leased
and
on
what
terms.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
oh,
i
know
only
one
boxing
or
another
or
whether
--
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
was
a
contract
or
arrangement.
the
court
would
decide
that.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
sir?
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
the
patents
--
yes,
sir.
that
--
that's
the
only
analogy.
those
are
the
analogies
we
know.
but
i
think
it's
quite
different
that
this
is
--
this
is
a
matter
of
running
this
different
type
of
business,
a
complicated
type
of
business.
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
decisions,
the
garden
or
the
stadium
or
any
other
arenas
got
to
make.
but
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
that's
where
it
leads.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
so
and
i
think
even
between
two
boxing
matches
is
very
difficult.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
sir.
this
goes
on,
in
and
out
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
this
is
an
addition.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
the
theory
of
that
apparently
is
that
they
want
to
open
up
so
anybody
can
go
in
the
garden
and
if
the
--
if
someone
else
comes
in,
they
--
the
judge
will
have
to
decide
it.
and
--
and
that's
true
although
there
are
hundreds
of
other
arenas.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
i
can.
well,
give
me
--
i'll
continue
while
they
are
looking
that
up.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
now,
even
if
that
applied
only
to
boxing,
it
would
still
prevent
a
--
present
a
very
complicated
problem.
and
if
it
did,
we
say
that
it's
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
all
to
be
done.
now,
it's
on
page
912
of
the
record,
provision
18
of
the
decree.
now,
we
--
we
assort
some
--
the
defendants
requested
three
options,
none
of
which
were
granted.
one
option
directed
to
the
threatened
divestiture
was
to
give
wirtz
and
norris
a
choice
whether
they'd
sell
their
stock
in
the
garden
or
in
the
stadium.
that
was
not
--
that
was
turned
down.
another
request
was
if
they
were
going
to
dissolve
and
enjoined
as
they've
threatened
at
one
time
to
do.
the
i.b.c.'s
or
many
activities,
they
were
landed
on
that.
that
it
would
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder.
and
the
final
one,
and
the
desperation
one
after
the
judge
had
informally
announced
what
he
was
going
to
do
was
one
i
referred
to
that
rather
than
this
divestiture
or
they
would
rather
stop
championship
boxing
in
the
garden
although
that
would
be
a
serious
thing
to
them.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well
sir,
that's
what
we
offered
to
do.
without
having
to
say
that,
it
said
it
would
be
terribly
unjust
to
the
--
but
that,
we'd
rather
have
that
than
what
we
have,
they've
offered
us.
now,
there's
one
other
thing.
this
decree
also
adversely
affects
nonchampionship
boxing
material.
it
interferes
and
makes
the
impossible
practically
the
continuation
of
these
weekly
series.
it
prevents
a
normal
contracts
that
are
made
with
boxers
and
arenas.
it
deprives
the
normal
and
recognized
methods
throughout
the
boxing
industry.
if
the
district
court
and
if
this
court
sustains
it
and
says
the
market
is
limited,
is
valid
and
limited
to
championship
boxing,
then
certainly,
they
should
not
step
into
the
other
field
and
interfere
seriously
with
the
operation
in
the
nonchampionship
boxing
field.
we
want
to
say
this
in
conclusion
that
if
you
find
a
violation
and
if
you
find
the
market
which
we
hope
you
won't
do,
that
it
would
be
sufficient
for
all
purposes
to
prohibit
exclusive
contracts
of
boxers,
to
prohibit
exclusive
contracts
with
arenas,
to
establish
a
two-bout
limitation.
that
would
meet
every
possible
legitimate
purpose.
this
two-bout
is
a
bad
thing.
the
government
didn't
ask
for
a
three-bout
limitation.
the
judge
put
the
two-bout
on.
and
it
would
put
them
whether
to
decide
a
disadvantage
because
other
arenas
would
have
a
great
advantage
at
all
bidding
for
championship
boxers
because
they
could
bid
for
any
and
we'd
be
limited
to
two.
and
it
would
give
them
even
as
to
the
others
an
advantage,
would
remove
the
competition
of
us
when
they
bid
for
the
others.
but
if
that
has
to
be
born
by
us
then
we
have
to
take
it.
the
--
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
much
the
abuse
of
discretion.
i
think
the
hartford
--
the
gypsum
case,
there
is
sufficient
law
on
that
and
it
--
i
understand
still
the
law
of
this
court
found
in
--
about
five
years
ago,
perhaps
six
years
ago
have
said
we
have
never
treated
the
power
of
the
trial
court
as
one
of
discretion
subject
only
to
reversal
for
gross
abuse.
rather,
we
have
failed
an
obligation
to
intervene
in
this
most
significant
phase
of
the
case,
that
is
the
relief
when
we
concluded
that
we
entered
appropriate
provisions
in
the
decree.
i
want
to
call
attention
again
to
the
fact
that
the
time
of
this
conspiracy
or
alleged
conspiracy
that
we
deny
that
the
defendants
had
no
reason
in
the
world.
the
think
they
have
done
anything
violative
of
the
rule
of
law.
the
trial
court
itself
says
that
it
did
not
charge
the
defendants
with
malicious,
intentional
or
moral
wrongdoing.
that's
what
the
court
says
and
added
that
at
the
time
of
their
acts,
most
people
felt
that
the
plaintiff's
action
was
not
prohibited.
on
those
facts,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
no
basis
we
think
for
the
drastic
remedy
and
that's
the
word
the
judge
used.
and
simple
justice
and
morals,
the
decree
should
be
at
most
a
curative
decree
with
no
element
of
punishment
or
oppression.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
violation
of
the
law
or
if
they
should
be,
we
think
that
the
decree
should
be
radically
changed
and
reduced
to
the
principles
which
i
have
sought
and
present
to
you.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
allowed
to
talk
about
burden
of
proof
and
what
we've
got
to
show
--
and
truth
about
it
is
that
the
judge's
findings,
and
we
speak
of
them
generically,
you're
likely
to
forget
the
fact
that
the
great
majority
have
more
conclusions
from
basic
facts.and
the
judge
himself
said
the
basic
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
and
what
he
meant
by
that
necessarily
were
the
facts
that
i
stated
to
you
in
my
argument
which
they
have
not
yet
challenged,
the
basic
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
now,
it's
difficult
in
the
case
like
this
for
counsel
to
--
not
to
make
some
mistakes
in
statements
of
fact.
and
when
i
call
attention
to
a
few
that
had
been
made
by
mr.
elman,
and
there
is
no
sense,
the
design
is
any
reflection
on
it.
but
some
of
them
are
pretty
serious.
i'll
just
to
call
attention
to
one
or
two
of
them.
he
argued
considerably
about
the
fact
that
we
had
proposed
this
compulsory
leasing.
the
circumstances
are
that
--
and
i'll
read
from
our
proposal
and
made
in
late
in
the
hearing,
the
defendants
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
this
is
in
may.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
may
what?
22nd.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
it's
on
page
616.
this
is
a
rather
serious
error
because
he
based
to
get
this
argument
on.
“the
defendants
pursuant
to
the
suggestion
of
the
court
respectfully
submit
without
prejudice
to
their
rights
the
following
modification
of
the
form
of
judgment
suggested
by
them.”
that's
where
it
came
in,
this
compulsory
leasing.
that's
a
rather
far
cry
from
saying
that
it
came
at
the
suggestion
of
the
defendants.
now,
there
are
some
other
things
that
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i'm
not
sure
there's
any.
we
can
find
this.
i'm
sure.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
now
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
it's
in
the
minutes,
i
know
but
--
but
i'll
find
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
338.
now,
the
--
another
situation
is
--
in
some
of
the
beginning
matters,
you
said
the
tournament
of
champions
was
in
--
had
vast
resources,
the
record
shows
exactly
the
contrary.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
i
agree
that
it
happened
but
he
said
we
suggested.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
we
did
not
suggest
it.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
the
judge
had
suggested
it.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
we
were
merely
implementing
what
the
judge
asked
us
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
that
is
the
only
the
difference,
yes,
sir.
i'm
not
--
now,
he
spoke
of
--
of
exclusive
contract
about
a
french
transaction.
these
are
minor
illustrations.
that
was
on
the
ground
of
--
the
dispute
was
whether
to
be
--
the
fact
would
be
here
or
in
france,
nothing
to
do
with
any
other
exclusive
feature.
he
stated
inadvertently
that
the
word
“drastic”
was
stated
by
the
judge
early
in
the
session.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statement
by
the
judge
was
on
the
--
after
the
decree
when
we
were
discussing
the
judgment.
he
said,
“i
have
directed
some
very
drastic
steps,”
that's
on
page
904.
so
that
was
the
opinion
of
the
judge
even
after
the
decree
was
made.
and
i
will
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
judge
himself
said
he
wanted
this
matter
of
review
considered
by
this
court
because
he
thought
that
it
was
--
they
were
unusual
and
drastic
provisions.
the
--
we'll
find
that
--
he
--
he
said
the
--
the
dissolution,
and
i
know
he
was
--
thought
he
was
entirely
correct,
originated
later
in
the
hearing.
it
was
proposed
by
the
government
in
april
of
1947.
now,
your
honor,
the
--
i
don't
want
to
lightly
dismiss
this
matter
of
market.
i'm
just
going
to
say
a
word
about
it.
they
can
use
special
and
unique.
but
the
facts
are
not
denied,
the
facts
i
presented
this
morning,
the
facts
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
that
is
just
a
gradation
and
not
one
that
is
a
difference
in
kind.
there
was
no
denial
in
his
argument,
at
least
no
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
i'm
stating
the
--
the
facts
as
undisputed
as
to
basic
facts.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
on
which
question,
sir?
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
the
finding
of
the
court,
as
i
said
--
this
is
--
this
finding
was
that
it
was
special
and
unique.
and
i
said
that
as
a
conclusion
and
not
a
factual
--
not
a
basic
factual
finding.
i
stated
at
the
beginning
that
the
judge
made
a
number
of
findings
which
are
conclusions
from
basic
facts.
as
to
those,
they
are
to
be
considered
as
conclusions
as
the
court
has
said
time
and
again,
their
inferences.
now,
the
--
we
were
--
the
judge
has
said
also
that
--
in
--
at
the
time
he
rendered
his
decree
or
approximately
that
time,
that
in
his
opinion,
we
had
--
had
committed
no
more
wrong
and
that
a
majority
of
the
people
thought
that
what
we
did
was
entirely
all
right.
“it
was
not
prohibited”
was
his
words.
and
that
is
a
consideration
which
this
court,
i
know,
will
have
in
mind
in
--
in
granting
what
the
court
himself
says
as
a
drastic
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
we
cited
it
in
the
brief.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
it's
in
the
brief,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
we
cite
that.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i
think
that
the
divestiture
one
is
the
most
serious.
i
think
the
compulsory
leasing
will
so
encumber
and
complicated.
the
orderly
continuity
that
all
boxing
arrangements
must
held
that
it
also
is
very
limited.
now,
i
think
the
divorcement
is
a
totally
unnecessary
thing
which
a
judge
in
effect
not
in
the
fact
that
he
has
found
it
to
be
because
he
suggested
himself
that
we
reorganize
the
same
corporation,
the
i.b.c.
of
madison
square
garden.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
dissolution,
i
mean,
dissolution.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
i
misspoke
myself.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
owned
by
the
garden.
well,
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
owned
--
it
was
owned
by
the
--
eventually,
it
changed
two
or
three
times.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
at
the
time
of
the
decree,
it
was
owned
by
the
garden,
is
that
right?
owned
entirely
by
the
garden.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
what?
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
there
--
i.b.c.
of
new
york
was
owned
by
the
garden.
the
i.b.c.
of
illinois
was
owned
by
the
stadium.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
oh,
new
york
i.b.c.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
that's
right,
sir.
well,
sir
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no,
sir,
they
will
not
be
control.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
we
--
we
don't
know,
sir.
that
was
one
of
the
things
in
desperation.
we
suggested
to
the
court,
as
i
said
this
morning
so
--
at
--
at
public
auction.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
necessary
that
i
come
back
to
this
one
thing
and
conclude.
the
--
what
we
--
what
we
feel
is,
to
take
in
into
consideration,
the
admitted
good
faith
in
these
men
in
doing
what
they
said,
taking
into
account
that
the
judge
himself
says
and
most
people
thought
it
was
not
prohibited,
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
they
had
put
a
great
deal
of
money
into
this
garden
long
before,
and
his
this
--
this
figure
of
$50,000
is
not
correct
if
you
consider
the
--
the
connections
that
they
had
which
are
later
in
the
record.
if
you
consider
those
matters
and
if
you
do
three
things
that
their
exclusive
contracts
with
boxers
will
be
prohibited.
second,
the
exclusive
contracts
with
stadia
be
prohibited.
so
that
they
just
have
to
work
in
their
own
house
and
a
limitation
on
the
number
of
championship
fights.
you
will
hurt
them
but
you
will
permit
them
to
continue
and
permit
them
to
cover
the
country
with
the
boxing
shows
that
we
believe
are
good
and
certainly
they
are
immensely
popular
and
yet
leave
plenty
of
room
for
as
much
competition
as
can
possibly
come.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
what?
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
it's
in
--
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes
--
yes
it's
in
there,
down
on
the
page
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
if
--
if
it
would
be
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
738.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i
beg
your
pardon.
