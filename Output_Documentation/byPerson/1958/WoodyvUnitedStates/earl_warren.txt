now.
chief

you
may
proceed,
ms.

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
ms.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
rosenberg,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
can
--
can
you
conceive
of
any
set
of
circumstances
wherein
a
person
would
knowingly
transport
a
car
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
this
section,
and
at
the
same
time,
not
have
the
intention
to
conceal
that
theft
from
the
authorities
or
from
the
true
owner
or
from
whomever
you
might
choose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
may
i
ask
you
this,
and
if
that
is
true,
where
are
you
going
to
start
by
saying
that
at
a
certain
point,
concealment
becomes
a
crime
separate
from
that
of
stealing
the
car
and
transporting
it
across
state
lines?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
man
is
going
from
california
to
new
york,
he
steals
a
car
to
drive
to
new
york,
everytime
he
puts
it
in
a
garage
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
--
or
puts
it
in
the
side
road,
is
he
guilty
of
separate
concealment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
any
concealment
separate
from
--
from
the
transporting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
you
think
congress
made
that
distinction?
i'm
not
saying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
of
your
brief.
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
woolsey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
woolsey,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
appreciation
for
the
service
you've
rendered
to
this
impecunious
defendant.
and
we
know
that
the
fact
that
you
came
from
--
far
away
as
missouri
to
undertake
this
without
any
compensation
to
yourself
and
in
the
interest
of
seeing
justice
done,
it
is
great
satisfaction
to
us.
thank
you
very
much.

you,
ms.
rosenberg,
for
your
