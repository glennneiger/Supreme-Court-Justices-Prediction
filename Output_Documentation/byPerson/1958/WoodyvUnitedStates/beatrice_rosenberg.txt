ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
correct.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
first
question
in
this
case
is
what
is
before
the
court
because
as
the
peculiar
way
in
which
this
case
came
before
this
court.
this
was
a
second
motion
under
2255,
your
honor,
had
been
denied
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
and
there
had
been
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court,
which
the
court
had
denied
in
1955,
that's
number
227
miscellaneous
of
the
1955
term.
he
had
raised
other
issues
in
addition.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
there
had
been
a
previous
motion
under
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
2255,
which
raised
other
issues
but
did
raise
the
same
contention
as
well.
but,
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
it
did
not
particularly
based
it's
denial
of
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
on
the
ground
which
it
could
have
done,
that
it
was
the
second
motion.
it
went
on
to
say
that
this
was
a
matter
which
should
have
been
raised
on
appeal
and
the
trial
judge
is
very
familiar
with
the
facts
and
is
convinced
there
is
no
merit
in
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
the
original
conviction
had
not
been
appealed.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
trial
judge
said
this
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
can't
tell,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
know
whether
he
really
--
the
transcript
had
not
been
transcribed,
the
--
the
record
of
the
trial.
he
did
not
have
a
transcript
before
him.
and
when
he
said,
it's
on
page
30
of
the
record,
this
court
said
a
trial
judgment
in
the
case
at
the
time
it
was
tried
and
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
fact
and
is
convinced
there
was
no
merit
and
so
on.
i
just
can't
tell
whether
he
is
saying
that
on
these
facts,
there
was
adequate
proof
of
separate
acts
of
concealment
or
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
from
the
charges
of
the
plaintiff,
both
these
things
are
possible
because
there
is
no
question
that
at
the
time
he
was
deciding
this
motion,
he
had
--
had
six
cases
in
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
happened
to
have
ruled
on
this
question
more
than
the
others,
which
said
that
even
if
they
are
part
of
one
transaction
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
these
--
these
that
are
served
in
forma
pauperis,
it's
hard
to
say.
some
of
them
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
if
you'll
bear
with
me,
i
was
going
to
discuss
that.
but
i
just
wanted
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
to
get
this
history
first
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
because
--
we
will
get
to
it.
as
i
say,
this
is
what
the
trial
judge
said,
and
i
can't
tell
that,
as
i
think,
he
was
putting
it
on
two
grounds
of
the
indictment,
figure
out
he
was
saying,
"i
remember
the
facts
and
there
is
nothing
to
it,"
and
any
way
even
taking
petitioner's
allegation,
that
wouldn't
be
a
legal
ground.
and
he
had
ample
basis
for
that
in
the
decisions
that
his
and
other
circuits
at
the
time.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know
whether
he
did
or
not.
he
says
he
is
familiar
with
the
facts.
i
don't
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
we
have
no
indication
of
what
he
based
that
on.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
some
--
some
judgment
to
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
i
say,
i
--
i
--
we
just
don't
know.
there
is
no
indication.
all
he
said
he
was
familiar.
now,
it
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that's
on
page
49
of
the
record.
and
they
say
first
that
the
law
is
against
petitioner
in
this
and
every
other
circuit
that's
passed
on.
and
now,
i
take
it
is
even
assuming
that
it's
part
of
one
transaction
as
he
alleges,
this
would
still
be
two
different
offenses.
and
when
the
court
says,
as
it
does
at
page
50,
with
respect
to
the
motion
to
remand,
the
motion
to
remand
is
also
denied
for
the
reason
that
the
facts
relied
upon
are
not
in
dispute
and
were
fully
disclosed
by
the
motion.
in
the
light
of
the
cases
and
in
the
light
of
the
facts
that
the
record
was
not
before
the
court,
i
think
this
can
be
read
only
as
saying
even
if
we
take
the
fact
as
petitioner
alleges
them
to
be
that
this
was
part
of
one
transaction,
we
still
hold
that
there
would
be
two
offenses.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
number
of
the
cases
that
they
cite
say
so,
so
that
--
i
think
that's
the
bare
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
was
position
that
the
government
met
in
its
brief
in
our
position
to
certiorari.
it
says,
"even
on
this
assumption,
concealment
would
be
something
separate
from
transportation
and
therefore
possible."
then
this
court
granted
certiorari.
now,
it's
true
that
technically
what
was
before
the
court
of
--
what
was
before
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
the
denial
of
a
motion
of
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
but
with
the
authority,
the
power
it
takes
back
of
this,
the
court
took
it
in
that
posture
and
decided
the
merit.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
took
this
case
for
the
merits
too
since
the
court
of
appeals,
although
denying
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
has
passed
on
the
merit
on
the
basis
of
petitioner's
allegation,
in
effect,
sustained
the
demurrer
to
his
allegation.
they
said,
"even
saying
what
you
--
what
you
said
was
true,
you
haven't
made
out
a
case."
well,
now
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
correct.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
correct.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
our
view
of
it
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
our
view
it
is
a
little
different,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
clear.
that's
the
problem.
the
--
the
court
of
appeal
sustained
a
demurrer.
this
court
indicated
a
desire
to
hear
the
merits.
and
that
--
at
that
point,
petitioner
made
a
motion
on
his
own,
originally
before
counsel
was
appointed
to
him
that
he
wanted
the
record.
now,
as
i
am
going
to
explain
a
little
later
when
we
get
to
it,
the
government's
position
has
been
and
consistently
been
that
where
the
facts
are
undisputed,
the
question
of
multiplicity
of
punishment
for
one
of
them
is
one
which
is
available
on
collateral
attack.
we
never
denied
that.
and
therefore,
the
question
is,
was
this
a
case
where
the
fact
could
be
conceded
and
therefore,
the
merits
raised.
and
so
with
that
in
mind
we
said,
"well
can
we
--
let's
get
the
record
and
see
can
we
concede
the
petitioner's
allegations
are
correct."
and
as
it
turned
out
when
we
got
the
record,
the
record,
instead
of
aiding
petitioner,
was
clearly
not
in
his
--
not
helpful
to
him,
and
that
was
the
situation.
now,
in
the
gore
case,
it's
the
other
way
around.
the
same
situation
to
some
degree,
without
denials
of
leave,
happened
in
gore.
when
the
court
took
the
case
on
the
merit,
the
petitioner
said,
"we've
made
these
allegations.
we'd
like
to
be
able
to
prove
them."
the
record
was
furnished
to
him
because
obviously,
on
the
collateral
attack
on
the
judgement,
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
allegations
will
rest
on
petitioner.
and
so
our
position
is
that
if
the
record
can't
be
considered,
you've
got
to
take
the
case
in
the
--
in
--
pass
your
most
favorable
to
the
government
and
therefore,
you've
got
to
assume
that
an
indictment
which
could
cover
different
acts
does.
this
lot
of
cases
generally,
that
principle
goes
through
all
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
if
we
can't
get
to
the
record,
you've
got
to
take
the
record
in
as
like
most
favorable
to
the
government.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
that's
what
i'm
coming
to.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
this
--
that
is
just
what
i'm
coming
to,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
the
first
question
here.
now,
this,
as
we
understand
it,
is
the
situation
with
respect
to
record.
this
court
decided
way
back
in
ex
parte
lang,
in
ex
parte
schnell,
that
where
on
the
face
of
an
indictment,
it
was
--
it
could
be
shown
from
the
indictment
and
the
judgment
that
a
sentence
was
excessive
or
in
violation
of
double
jeopardy.
that
was
the
matter
that
could
be
reached
on
habeas
corpus.
this
was
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
appeal
in
criminal
cases.
and
whatever
correction
came,
came
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
in
an
appeal
in
that
kind
of
proceeding.
now,
following
that
precedent,
even
though
(inaudible)
double
jeopardy
terms,
following
that
precedent,
even
after
there
were
appeals
in
criminal
cases,
the
court
considered
question
of
whether
a
particular
sentence
was
on
two
counts,
that
is
consecutive
sentences,
whether
that
was
merely
for
one
offense,
that
was
considered
an
issue
cognizable
on
habeas
corpus.
and
even
as
suggested
by
halladay
against
johnson,
even
cognizable
by
a
motion
under
rule
35
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence,
and
that
is
concededly
a
very
limited
motion,
which
goes
only
to
the
face
of
the
indictment
and
to
the
judgment.
and
so
under
35,
it's
got
to
be
that
the
indictment
and
the
judgment
can't
consider
anything
else.but
on
habeas
corpus,
though
we've
had
a
somewhat
broader
scope,
and
so
morgan
against
devine,
in
237
united
states,
you
couldn't
absolutely
tell
from
the
face
of
the
indictment,
but
the
court
says
that
the
attack
is
not
in
dispute.
and
for
that
reason,
they
went
on
to
discuss
merits,
although
they
held
against
it.
now,
that
was
a
situation
in
bell
against
the
united
states.
at
the
time
of
the
brief
in
our
position
in
bell,
we
raised
the
question
of
whether
that
issue
was
properly
cognizable
because
from
the
face
of
the
indictment,
even
though
it
was
on
the
same
day,
you
couldn't
tell
whether
it
was
at
exactly
the
same
time
or
at
two
different
times
the
same
day.
we
didn't
press
that
in
the
brief
in
the
merits
because
the
authority
seem
to
support
the
view,
that
it
was
proper
to
--
if
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts,
to
let
the
--
the
issue
was
one
cognizable
on
habeas
corpus
and
therefore
undisputed
facts
could
be
shown.
now,
there
is
one
case
that
goes
one
step
beyond
that,
and
it's
one
of
the
older
ones,
it's
the
ex
parte
nielsen.
this
is
in
131
united
states,
and
it's
discussed
at
page
18
of
our
brief.
now,
in
nielsen,
the
indictment
charged
that
the
defendant
had
first
pleaded
guilty
that
charged
him
with
unlawful
cohabitation
until
--
for
a
certain
period
until
may
13th.
and
he
pleaded
guilty
that
--
to
that
indictment
in
september.
subsequently,
he
was
indicted
for
adultery
with
the
same
woman
on
may
14th,
the
day
after
the
termination
of
the
first
indictment.
and
he
made
it
--
he
filed
a
demurrer
to
that
and
said,
"even
though
the
first
indictment
only
went
to
may
13th
at
the
time
i
pleaded
guilty,
the
offense
extended
over
until
september
and
covered
the
second
indictment."
the
government
demurred
to
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
thereby
admitting
the
facts.
and
the
--
it
was
overruled,
he
was
sentenced.
he
then
brought
habeas
corpus.
now,
when
--
on
the
habeas
corpus
action,
the
government
said,
"oh,
no,
this
is
not
habeas
corpus
because
this
doesn't
appear
on
the
face
of
the
indictment."
and
this
court
said
that
"if
the
facts
of
double
conviction,"
and
i
am
quoting,
“appears
in
the
indictment
or
anywhere
else
in
the
record,
of
which
the
judgment
is
only
a
part,
it
is
sufficient,
anywhere
else
in
the
record.”
in
the
present
case,
it
appeared
on
the
record
in
the
plea
of
(inaudible)
which
was
admitted
to
be
true
by
the
demurrer
of
the
government,
we
think
this
was
sufficient.
now,
as
we
take
these
cases
together,
what
it
amounts
to
is
this,
that
as
long
as
from
a
record
the
fact
appear
without
dispute,
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
resolve
conflict
which
would
have
been
resolved
by
a
jury
or
to
go
into
matters
which
should
have
been
made
at
the
trial
but
hadn't.
so
long
as
--
what
is
significant
to
the
issue
of
multiple
offenses
appears
somehow
in
the
record
beyond
dispute.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
all
i
can
say
on
that,
your
honor,
is
that
we
would
then
be
having
--
this
court
would
then
be
called
upon
to
decide.
well,
i
suppose
in
a
sense,
a
demurer
--
we
could
--
you
--
what
would
happen,
if
--
if
one
doesn't
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
is,
that
the
court
could
say
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
even
if
this
is
one
transaction,
it's
one
of
this.
it
was
wrong
in
so
doing,
but
assuming
now
that
it
would
reach
that
result,
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
for
a
hearing
which
petitioner
would
have
to
prove
his
allegation
that
it
was
all
part
of
one
transaction.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
ladner.
now,
what
we
were
arguing
about
in
ladner
is
can
he
be
called
--
if
he
can't
prove
it
by
undisputed
fact,
if
he
does
not
have
the
kind
of
a
record
which
simply
does
not
present
the
issues
so
that
we
know
where
it
is,
can
a
subsequent
2255
court
undertake
to
try
to
decide
one,
whether
there
was
any
evidence
at
the
trial
on
this
issue,
if
there
was
a
conflict,
can
it
try
to
decide
the
conflict?
and
i
think
maybe
because
we
confined
our
discussion
to
that
particular
problem
in
ladner,
we
gave
both
impression
about
what
our
general
position
was,
as
i
say
at
the
time
of
bell,
we
didn't
dispute
the
right,
although
it
didn't
absolutely
appear
on
the
face
of
the
indictment,
the
problem
is
this
goes
right
through
habeas
corpus
law
generally,
that
is
--
for
instance
in
removal
proceeding,
the
rule
was
in
the
old
days
that
removal
proceedings'
validity
of
the
indictment
so
on
could
be
considered
a
removal
at
the
time
of
removal.
but
in
rodman
against
pothier
in
261
united
states,
the
court
says,
"but
if
the
issues
are
going
to
be
complicated,
if
they
are
complicated
the
issues
of
law
are
facts,
then
that's
got
to
go
over
to
the
trial
court."
and
the
same
way
in
the
bowen
case,
the
court
said,
"well,
this
is
a
special
kind
of
jurisdictional
issue,
and
it
doesn't
turn
undisputed
facts,
and
there
is
no
proof
that
the
trial
judge
went
it
or
not,
and
so
we
think
the
court
can
considerate
it."
but
suggestion
in
the
bowen
case
is
that
it's
going
to
involve
issues
of
facts
that
should
have
been
before
the
jury
then
you
can't.
so
that
it
maybe
unfortunate
that
relief
sometimes
depends
on
whether
it's
complicated
or
not,
but
it's
almost
necessary
realistically
because
when
you
got
the
facts
clear
and
spelled
out
and
no
dispute,
there's
no
reason
why
a
court
couldn't
--
shouldn't
consider
them.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
rest
on
it
but
we
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
not
quite
the
whole
picture
in
the
sense
that
presumably
also
petitioner
--
the
burden
of
proof
would
have
been
on
petitioner
to
prove
his
allegation.
now,
this
court
denied
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
you
can't,
therefore,
hold
him
to
the
same
sort
of
things.
so
it
seems
practical
and
reasonable
to
say,
"well,
maybe
we
can
agree
that
these
are
the
facts
and
that
we
can
go
on
from
there."
now,
it
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
government,
the
government
and
counsel.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
say
initially
when
the
record
was
ordered,
when
initially
when
the
record
was
ordered,
it
was
done
if
--
in
--
in
opposition
to
the
motion
of
petitioner
pro
se
for
the
projection
of
the
record.
the
government
said
it
maybe
unnecessary
to
order
the
record
because
it
is
possible
that
we
can
stipulate
with
counsel
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
well,
then,
it
turned
out
--
it
was
going
to
be
complicated.
we
got
the
record.
on
that
basis,
the
question
is,
what
do
we
do?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what
do
we
do?
do
we
say
that
this
court,
"decide
this
demurrer
although
now
we
know
that
the
facts
are
different"?
i
--
or
do
we
say,
"well,
this
--
we
now
know
this
is
the
case,
what
you
do
want
to
do
with
it?"
and
let
me
--
it's
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
only
the
demurrer
but
our
position
is,
if
counsel
is
not
willing
to
stipulate
as
to
the
fact
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
it's
his
position.
and
as
i
say,
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
i
take
it
that
technically,
what's
before
in
this
court
is
a
denial
of
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
although
it
has
--
but
the
court
said
empowered,
well,
the
court
of
appeals
although
it
denied
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
indicated
its
position
on
the
merit,
wouldn't
make
any
sense
for
us
to
send
it
back
for
them
to
decide
the
merits
and
then
take
it
up
again,
and
so
the
merits
are
here,
that's
this
case.
the
merits
are
here,
the
facts
are
not.
the
--
we
don't
think
that
the
government
would
be
in
a
position
to
ask
this
court
to
decide
a
legal
position
which
proves
to
be
not
the
fact,
not
a
real
character.
in
addition
to
which,
may
i
point
out,
that
the
importance
of
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i
see.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
that
the
district
court
when
it
said,
"i
am
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
facts."
now,
it
didn't
have
this
actual
record
before
it
but
it
had
--
it
had,
whether
through
notes
or
other
ways
of
recollection
of
what
this
record
tells
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
the
situation
is
this,
your
honor,
as
i
see
it.
the
district
court's
opinion
says
this
petitioner
is
wrong
on
the
fact
and
on
the
law.
now,
if
instead
of
getting
it
later,
this
record
had
happened
to
be
filed
because
there
had
been
an
appeal
in
this
case
from
the
conviction,
if
the
court
had
said,
"on
the
facts
and
on
the
law,
i
saw
and
you
are
wrong,"
there
would
have
been
an
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
said,
"we
find
you
wrong
on
the
law
and
therefore,
we
don't
get
to
the
fact,"
and
then
he
could
have
come
up
here
and
we
would
have
said,
"well,
it's
true,
we
could
have
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
court
was
wrong,
i
mean
that
the
district
court
had
found
he
was
wrong
on
the
fact
as
well
as
the
law.
and
i
don't
think
the
situation
is
different
just
because
the
district
court
had
the
memory
and
we
have
the
record
on
which
its
memory
was
bad.
i
think
that's
the
situation
now.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i'm
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
mr.
justice,
we
respond
--
we
have
a
right
to
defend
on
any
ground
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
that's
available
to
us.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
--
our
position
is
that
this
record,
if
we
rely
on
it,
and
as
i
say
in
the
first
place
is
simply
seeing
that
the
court
ought
to
know
that
in
the
face
of
recent
decisions
which
have
made
the
single
--
particularly
ladner,
which,
of
course,
came
down
since,
have
made
one
transactions
against
two,
much
more
of
a
factor
than
it's
ever
been
before
in
some
of
the
older
decisions
than
the
face
of
that
recent
decision
and
the
face
of
the
fact
that
in
attempting
to
stipulate
the
facts,
the
--
facts
turned
out
otherwise,
so
that
there
is
now
before
the
court
an
academic
issue,
feel
duty
bound
to
bring
it
before
the
court
and
then
to
present
those
points
of
view,
that
is
i
think
the
facts
are
property
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
--
as
i
say,
if
this
transcript,
instead
of
being
simply
in
the
judge's
memory,
had
been
on
file,
and
then
we
simply
--
and
we
had
exactly
the
same
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
merely
said
we
don't
have
to
go
to
the
facts
because
we
think
you
--
you
are
wrong
on
the
law
even
on
the
facts
as
you
alleged
them
to
be,
we,
as
respondents,
could
have
relied
on
the
fact
in
the
report
of
the
result
below
is
not
the
judgment.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
that's
my
position.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
brings
me
to
the
merit.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
as
i
say
one
of
the
problems,
of
course,
is
that
this
is
new
to
this
degree
that
there
were
--
this
seems
to
have
been
a
quite
settled
subject
to
the
district
court.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
at
the
time
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
have
to
go
further
than
this
court's
decision
in
(inaudible)
to
which
is
sort
of
the
bible
on
the
subject
even
though
it
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
habeas
corpus,
where
there
was
a
division
of
opinion
and
where
--
well,
there
isn't
an
absolutely
steady
line
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
that
court
to
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
yes,
usually,
they
are
served.
usually,
a
copy
is
served
and
the
matter
is
often
set
down
for
hearing.
that
is
a
--
a
kind
of
order
to
show
cause
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
in
your
procedure.
occasionally
and
particularly
with
someone
like
this
petitioner
who
has
filed
a
number
of
them,
he
has
some
other
types
of
things.
occasionally
one
the
prisoner
does
not
serve
the
united
states
attorney
and
sometimes
even
before
the
united
states
attorney
has
had
a
chance
to
reply
a
judge
may
act,
but
that's
not
the
normal
case.
the
normal
case
is
like
a
motion
or
like
habeas
corpus
used
to
be,
the
--
the
petition
is
served
on
the
government
and
then
the
government
files
some
sort
of
answer
deciding
whether
to
issue
it
or
not
in
theory
because,
as
i
say,
if
a
judge
reading
a
petition
just
(inaudible)
the
petitioner
says
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
convict
me,
which
is
clearly
not
a
grant
between
2255,
he
won't
ask
for
a
reply.
but
the
statute
has
--
i
don't
have
it
here
unfortunately,
specific
provision
for
a
notice,
and,
of
course,
if
there
is
an
issue
of
fact,
then
there
has
to
be
a
hearing.
so
that
i
think
--
i
think
the
confusion,
to
some
extent,has
not
been
in
that.
i
think
there
has
been
a
not
absolutely
consistent
position
on
--
to
what
extent
in
this
particular
field
of
multiple
offenses.
you
can
go
beyond
the
face
of
the
indictment
and
that's
because
of
the
use
of
rule
35.
now,
rule
35
is
--
is
recognized
as
being
available,
but
that
isn't
a
--
a
remedy
that
strictly
limits
to
the
face
of
the
indictment.
and
i
think
that
sometimes
that's
carried
out.
but
the
indications
seems
to
be
that
if
--
as
i
say,
if
you
can
agree
on
the
facts,
then
that's
a
matter
that's
cognizable.
now,
we've
also,
in
this
particular
field,
it
also
has
just
recently,
as
i
have
said,
become
of
importance
whether
it's
one
transaction
or
two
because
if
you
take
all
the
decisions
from
the
time
before
bell
and
after
nielsen,
it
--
in
the
end,
wouldn't
make
any
difference
by
and
large
the
whole
trend
of
decisions
was,
that
even
though
it
was
one
transaction,
if
there
were
different
elements,
it
would
still
be
offense.
this
--
the
court
has
never
found
it
necessary
to
go
into
the
facts
because
in
that
whole
group
of
decisions,
it
was
just
easy
enough
to
say,
"well,
let's
take
these
allegations
as
true
which
still
are
separate
offenses."
and
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no,
i'm
just
noticing
that
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
have
time
to
get
to
the
merits
before
recess.
and
--
so
that
--
that
becomes
the
problem
and
this
matter
of,
generally
in
2255,
getting
in
the
record
--
well,
there
are
a
tremendous
number
of
these
petitions
that
are
filed
and
a
transcript
in
many
of
them,
of
course,
it
does
not
seem
to
the
united
states
attorney.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
of
the
allegation
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
of
the
petitioner,
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
they
haven't
raised
it
in
this
field,
but
i
think
they
have
--
i
think
they
have
raised
it
as
to
other
allegations,
that
is,
i
think
--
for
example,
you
get
very
often
the
allegation
that
evidence
was
obtained
by
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
and
i
think
the
normal
reply
to
that
kind
of
an
allegation
is
this
is
not
necessarily
cognizable
under
2255.
so
that
--
i
think
that
it's
true
that
in
this
field
of
multiple
offenses,
it
hasn't
been
made
very
often
because
--
well,
it
is
a
recognized
ground
for
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
in
that
sense,
cognizable.
and
the
only
issue
that
was
involved
in
ladner
was,
is
it
cognizable
when
you
have
a
dispute
as
to
fact,
not
--
the
government
didn't
mean
to
imply,
and
certainly
--
consistently
throughout
the
years
of
taking
opposite
decisions
that
the
mere
fact
of
multiple
sentences
was
an
issue
properly
cognizable
on
2255.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
issue
beyond
procedure
which
was
in
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
the
question
is
whether
the
one
who
transports
a
stolen
vehicle
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
what
is
now
2312
can
ever
be
guilty
of
receiving
and
concealing,
specifically,
we
rest
on
concealing,
that
same
automobile
which
he
had
transported.
in
other
words,
a
violation
of
2313,
and
it
comes
down
to
the
question
of
whether
the
transporter
is
covered
by
the
word
"whoever"
in
2313.
and
on
that,
we
think
the
answer
must
be
yes
in
a
proper
case
where
acts
of
concealment
are
proved.
he
can,
the
transporter
can
properly
be
found
guilty
of
a
violation
of
2313
because
2313
punishes
not
only
receives,
conceals
and
stores
but
sells
and
disposes
of
an
automobile.
and
on
its
face
and
in
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
evident
that
whoever
sells
an
automobile
may
very
well
be
the
transporter.
and
by
the
same
token,
there
is
no
reason
we
--
whoever
concealed
as
not
covering
the
transporter.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
receives
--
if
"receive"
is
part
of
the
transportation,
then
it
was
being
to
me
that
that
would
be
so
much
a
part
of
that
transaction,
that
receipt
alone,
unless
it
were
a
discreet
act
in
some
fashion.
i
suppose
it
is
possible
to
imagine
a
situation
where
someone
transport
and
then
subsequently
in
some
other
transaction,
receive
that
same
automobile.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
a
different
transaction,
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
of
whoever?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
not.
i
think
what
happens
is
that
congress
has
covered
situations
here
which
are
posed,
that
is
what
is
punishing
or
various
act,
receipt,
concealment,
store.
now,
some
of
these
are
normally
the
actions
of
only
the
receiver
of
so-called
offense.
and
receipt
would
be
that
--
would
--
receipt
would
be
the
kind
of
an
act
that
would
apply
only
to
offense.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
other
hand,
sell
and
dispose
of
could
be
either
offense
or
somebody
else.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
--
for
example
--
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
--
for
example,
somebody
can
sell,
now,
could
he
may
simply
bought
it
and
not
sell?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
let
me
say
this.
we
--
the
question,
as
i
see,
we
start
at
the
premise,
you
are
saying
if
it's
one
transaction,
obviously
a
transporter
can
receive.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
in
some
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
now,
therefore,
a
transporter
can
receive
if
it's
separate.
therefore,
a
transporter
can
conceal,
certainly,
if
it's
separate.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
as
i
--
as
i
understand
my
opponent
or
at
least
the
only
issue
i
think
that's
really
here,
even
whether
we
look
at
the
indictment
or
not,
since
--
since
it's
--
if
it's
possible
for
a
transporter
to
conceal,
then
either
we
have
to
take
the
situation
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government
and
say,
"well,
it's
possible,
and
you
haven't
shown
that
that
isn't
the
fact.
it's
possible
to
separate
or
else,
we
go
to
the
record
and
say
in
this
case,
it
is
separate
from
the
transportation.
but
in
any
event,
the
only
issue
in
this
case
at
this
point
from
--
from
the
indictment
is,
can
a
transporter,
dealing
with
the
vehicle
he
has
transported,
conceal
it?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
i
understand
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
your
honor,
that
it's
not
--
it's
the
court
that
has
made
that
distinction.
the
rule
of
(inaudible),
it
seems
to
me,
has
made
it
significant
as
i
didn't
--
as
heretofore
it
has
not
seem
to
us
significant,
whether
there
was,
whether
the
transactions
were
committed
or
i
mean
whether
the
offenses
charged
with
the
result
of
one
transaction
or
two.
this
is
not
to
say
that
if
it's
one
transaction,
it's
necessarily
one
offense.
but
--
well,
let's
start
with
the
bell
case.
the
bell
case
said,
where
two
women
are
transported
in
one
car,
that's
one
offense.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
am
saying
that
not
that
particular
set,
the
act
of
taking
involves
taking
into
possession.
but
i
--
i
can
imagine
a
situation
where
while
it
was
still
in
interstate
commerce,
the
transporter
of
the
vehicle
gave
it
to
a
confederate
who
concealed
the
change
and
now,
they
painted
it
and
then
he
took
it
back.
now,
on
petitioner's
scenery
that
a
transporter
of
a
stolen
motor
vehicle
can
never
be
guilty
of
2313
even
on
that
set
of
facts,
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
receiving
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
if
you're
not
restricting
the
face
of
the
indictment
that
here,
the
record
shows
discreet
acts
of
concealment,
which
were
--
which
were
a
part
in
the
transportation
and
in
addition
of
the
transportation
and
the
jury
saw
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
most
unlikely
but
i
don't
think
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
when
the
acts
of
concealment
are
beyond
the
type
of
concealment
that's
involved
merely
in
the
taking
of
the
car.
and
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
--
i
think
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
not.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
becomes
a
question
to
be
in
effect.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
--
let
me
say
this,
that
if
the
act
of
concealment
is
simply
throwing
a
car
in
a
garage
that
is
part
of
the
transportation,
that
--
that
--
to
me,
that
isn't
a
question
of
multiple
sentence,
that's
a
question
of
what
is
meant
by
concealment
as
used
in
the
statute.
that
is
--
i
think,
and
i
think
there
is
a
support
in
some
of
the
older
common
law
cases
which
--
that
concealment
means
some
active
--
reducing
to
your
own
possession,
beyond
that.
and
so
i
think
that
if
you
just
--
just
throwing
in
a
public
garage
may
well
not
be
storage
either
under
this,
but
that
if
you
have
a
special
hiding
place
and
you
store
it
in
that
special
kind
of
a
hiding
place
and
certainly,
when
you
perform
the
kinds
of
act
of
concealment
which
normally
seem
to
be
the
basis
of
prosecution,
which
is
changing
the
motor
number
that's
on
the
motor
and
repainting
the
car
as
was
done
here
or
getting
fictitious
bills
of
sale,
that
type
of
concealment
is
involved
in
merely
changing
the
character,
but
that's
so
separate
and
apart
from
the
transportation.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
while
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
goes
to
what
--
i
think
that
opens
a
definition
of
what
is
concealment.
and
i
think
there
is
--
there
is
room
for
interpretation.
and
i
think
what's
interesting,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
one
can
draw
conclusions
from
this
or
not,
but
the
cases
on
page
36
of
our
brief
in
which
the
court
have
said,
even
if
it's
part
of
one
transaction,
all
except
two,
i
have
done
there,
all
except
new
york
but
that's
a
mistake,
i
am
sorry,
it's
also
madsen
up
above
in
165
f.
2d
507.
that's
also
a
case
on
direct
appeal.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
page
36
of
our
brief.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
madsen,
it's
not
an
incorrect
citation,
it
stands
for
the
proposition
but
it's
--
it's
a
case
that
came
up
on
direct
appeal
rather
than
on
collateral
attack.
and
what's
interesting,
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
how
much
of
a
conclusion
one
can
drew
up
on
it,
but
what's
interesting
is
that
whenever
you
get
the
facts
of
these
concealment
cases
as
you
do
in
madsen
and
as
you
do
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
on
page
--
on
footnote
9
as
to
the
crime
of
concealment,
footnote
9
on
page
30,
whenever
you
actually
have
the
facts,
you
find
that
the
charge
of
concealment
is
supported
by
acts
that
are
other
than
simply
transporting
it,
that
they
are
somewhat
similar
in
character
of
the
acts
here
of
trading
four,
five
--
it's
like
changing
motor
numbers
which
is
a
common
one.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
i
say,
i
think
that
there
is
room
for
interpretation
as
to
what
is
concealment.
and
i
think
it
may
well
be
when
the
issue
comes
up
that
one
has
to
define
concealment
as
meaning
something
than
the
concealment
that's
just
inherent
in
the
facts
of
transportation.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that's
--
that's
some
affirmative
act.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
all
that
the
statute
requires
is
that
you
conceal
a
car
which
is
moving
in
or
part
of
interstate
commerce.
the
statute
--
i
mean
the
concealment
and
the
storage
and
the
selling
and
so
forth
doesn't
--
presumably
one
could
steal
a
car,
sell
it
for
somebody
there
with
the
intention
of
having
to
sell
it,
driving
at
away.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
not
transport
at
all.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i
think,
as
i
understand
my
opponent,
he
is
not
arguing
that
congress
couldn't
do
it.
the
question
is
what
the
congress
should
do.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
insofar
as
we
have
any
in
the
case,
and
it's
set
forth
in
our
brief,
i
don't
think
i
can
to
get
it,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
to
reach
separately,
the
man
who
stole
a
car
and
sold
it
whether
he
was
a
transporter
himself
or
not.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
2313
covers,
whoever
receives,
conceals,
sells
and
so
on,
and
sells,
i
think
it's
clear
they
intended
to
cover
situations
which
might
be
either
that
is
there
were
--
some
of
the
things
they
prohibit
that
would
be
normally
be
done
by
the
offense.there
is
some
that
might
be
done
by
either.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
that's
my
argument,
your
honor.
and
as
i
say
the
thing
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
this
is
--
i
think
i
never
completed
what
i
started
to
say
about
the
case
on
page
36,
that
where
we
have
the
facts,
which
is
in
madsen,
the
only
one
way
where
the
facts
are
really
spelled
out
and
integrate,
it
is
clearly
a
situation
like
this
where
they
were
changing
motor
numbers
and
all
sorts
of
that.
now,
what
happens
in
the
other
cases
though
is
that
they
come
up
on
collateral
attack.
there
are
either
pleas
of
guilty
or
somebody
later
on
has
made
this
allegation.
and
the
court,
for
that
reason,
the
courts
have
said
in
line
with
the
principles
of
blockburger
and
so
on
as
they
understood
them,
well,
even
accepting
your
allegation
that
there
is
one
transaction,
it
would
still
be
two
separate
offenses
under
blockburger
and
so
on.
but
we
don't
have
the
facts
in
those
cases.i
can't
tell.
but
what's
interesting
to
me
is
that
going
through
it
insofar
--
in
preparing
this
argument
and
reading
as
many
cases
as
i
could,
the
cases
that
--
that
involved
concealment
where
even
some
that
--
where
there
were
concurrent
sentences
and
--
so
that
the
issue
wasn't
raised,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
general,
this
whole
line
of
cases
may
well
be
academic,
of
course,
insofar
as
you
can
tell
from
the
reported
cases.
charges
of
concealment
have
usually
been
supported
with
proofs
of
acts
of
--
separate
acts
of
concealment
like
this
case
here.
now,
i
don't
know
how
much
--
i
don't
know
what
--
when
one
can
get
to
that
because
there
is
no
question
that
a
tremendous
number
of
dyer
act
convictions
are
disposed
of
by
pleas
of
guilty
that
9%,
i
think,
figure
show.
but
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
it
is
interesting
that
in
the
report
--
in
the
reported
cases,
the
acts
of
concealment
are
almost
dual
way,
separate
acts,
and
that
the
--
one
did
announce
his
general
principle
have
come
up
on
collateral
attack.
