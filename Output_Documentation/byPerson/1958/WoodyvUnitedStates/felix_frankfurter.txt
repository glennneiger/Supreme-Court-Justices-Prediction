justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
woolsey
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
brother
brennan
raises,
to
me,
a
very
serious
question,
namely,
what
the
scope
of
review
--
what
--
what
the
scope
of
review
before
us
is
which
i
take
it
in
turn
depends
on
what
it
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
deciding.
now,
am
i
wrong
in
reading
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
passed
on
the
--
in
affirming
the
order
denying
plea
to
appeal,
it
went
--
it
made
an
independent
examination.
district
court
has
said
if
i'm
writing
if
he
is
not
taking
in
good
faith
and
an
independent
examination
fails
to
disclose
the
certification
was
unwarranted.
and
then
the
last
paragraph
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
motion
to
remand
is
also
denied
for
the
reason
the
facts
relied
upon
are
not
in
dispute
and
were
fully
disclosed
by
the
motion
in
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
in
the
district
court.
therefore,
that
which
is
before
us
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
the
whole
record,
is
what
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
it
went
on,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
on
the
base
--
what
is
in
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
in
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
mean
merely
the
clerk's
journal
entry,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
records,
files
and
records.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
the
government
respond
--
did
the
u.s.
attorney
respond
to
that
motion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
suppose
it'd
be
easy
enough
if
it
becomes
relevant
for
the
government
or
for
you
to
supply
as
what
there
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
up
to
page
--
up
to
page
52,
mr.
woolsey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.--
ms.rosenberg
would
know
about
that
too,
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
may
i
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
wanting
to
interrupt
you,
is
the
court
of
appeals
correct
in
saying
that
--
where
is
that
39
or
40,
that
every
court
of
appeals,
but
that's
not
only
it
--
in
a
series
of
opinions,
but
every
court
of
appeals
has
--
has
decided
the
way
it
has
decided,
is
that
the
state
of
the
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
49
or
50.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
put
this
to
you,
mr.
woolsey,
that
judge
(inaudible)
if
it
was
in
his
order
denying
leave
while
he
set
forth
in
the
recital
that
the
attack
is
made
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment,
he
denied
the
order,
in
denying
the
order
he
said
this
court
that
as
trial
judge
in
the
case,
at
the
time
it
was
tried,
and
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
facts
as
they
were
then
presented
all
of
its
parties
and
all
of
its
recorded
(inaudible).
would
that
have
any
bearing
on
the
first?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
woolsey,
may
i
put
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ask
you
this
question.
i
think
i
appreciate
--
i
think
i
understand
the
reasons
why
you
pressed
that
the
hearing,
the
trial
hearing
are
not
relevantly
before
us,
not
to
be
considered.
i
think
i
understand
the
reason
why
you
(inaudible)
assuming
we
agree
with
you.
assuming
further,
however,
that
it
appeared
that
the
trial
minutes,
what
took
place
at
the
trial
would
take
the
case
on
the
facts
out
of
the
general
rule
which
you
urge,
would
you
think
it
was
appropriate
or
inappropriate
not
to
reverse
the
case
on
your
general
proposition
but
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeal
for
consideration
of
the
case
on
the
whole
record
including
what
took
place
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
assume
that
the
court
concludes
that
the
facts
make
a
differentiation,
some
of
the
questions
that
some
of
my
brethren
had
put
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
--
that
they
were
not
--
they
were
not
changing
the
--
what
will
be
placed
and
whatnot,
assume
that
one
reaches
that
conclusion
and
doesn't
agree
with
your
--
the
applicability
of
your
general
proposition
to
the
record,
the
facts
disclosed
at
the
trial
and
a
determination
whether
that
would
be
so
or
not,
might
become
relevant
either
for
us
to
decide
or
for
some
court
to
decide,
2255
is
a
kind
of
a
habeas
corpus
in
a
way,
a
kind
of
a
broad
equitable
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
might
be
the
place
here
to
decide,
although
it
wasn't
before
the
court
of
appeals.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
--
if
it
does
make
a
difference,
and
if
it
wasn't
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
might
be
proper,
i
put
that
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
position,
that
you
say
even
on
the
fact
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
differentiation,
it
is
one
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
was
it
that
would
(inaudible)
i
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
2255.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
--
did
the
original
conviction
go
up
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
unless
he
--
well,
let
me
put
--
let
me
put
it
the
other
way.
it's
a
very
common
practice,
i
believe,
among
district
judges
sitting
in
--
federal
district
judges
sitting
in
criminal
cases
do
what
the
old
--
what
the
english
judges
in
to
this
day
follow
the
testimony
and
make
notes
in
their
books
--
i
mean
their
own
--
their
own
shorthand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
that's
a
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
true?
that's
a
very
common
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
practise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
library
of
congress,
i
don't
know
how
many
hundreds
of
volumes
of
the
minutes
written
down
in
longhand
by
judge
hand
when
he
was
a
district
judge
in
great
detail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
a
difference
--
may
i
ask
this.
what
you
last
said
--
said
in
effect,
assuming
everything
you
say
is
practically
a
demurrer,
the
old
fashion
demurrer.
but
there
is
a
difference
in
the
--
in
the
fact,
in
the
disclosure
of
what
actually
took
place
in
--
in
this
case
between
what
would
appear
if
you
had
no
more
than
up
to
page
52,
and
what
you
draw
upon
from
the
transcript
of
hearing,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
no
argument.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
that's
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
there
is
a
question
whether
if
you
draw
some
strength
from
a
transcript
of
hearing
which,
in
the
nature
of
things,
couldn't
have
been
before
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
correct,
too?
couldn't
have
been
before
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
therefore,
it
can
draw
strength
from
something
in
the
transcript
of
the
hearing.
it
wasn't
before
the
court
of
appeals
but
is
now
printed,
then
it
raises
the
question
that
mr.
woolsey
properly
raised
as
to
whether
you
are
entitled
to
raise
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
come
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
sure
that
you
couldn't
get
--
that
one
couldn't
get
the
facts
merely
from
the
moving
papers
under
2255.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
--
when
you
say,
"if
you
can
consider
the
record,"
and
that
raises
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
can
consider
a
record
for
which
you
rely
not
on
the
general
proposition,
which,
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
is
all
you
need
in
this
case,
but
you
say
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
general
position
or
no
matter
what
you
think
of
it,
this
doesn't
come
within
the
disputed
problem,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
you
better
take
that
defense
if
you
can
for
the
(inaudible)
whether
what
use
--
what
proper
use
we
could
make
to
show
is
this
record
before
us
for
judicatory
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thereby
admitted
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
there
a
great
difference
between
all
the
cases
in
which
you
referred
and
the
case
in
which
the
record,
as
you
call
it,
is
a
unilateral
presentation
and
the
petitioner
objects
to
that
level,
he
doesn't
assent
to
it,
he
opposes
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
practical
problem
created
by
doing
these
things
otherwise
than
it
was
on
here,
namely,
it's
merely
a
question
of
transcribing
the
trial
minutes
when
--
when
the
thing
is
challenged
and
the
government
doesn't
rest
on
the
merely
legal
proposition
that
assume
it's
one
transaction,
we
still
--
still
can
impose
sentences.
if
the
government
doesn't
want
to
--
if
you
want
to
--
if
you
were
here
questioning
on
that
proposition,
you
wouldn't
be
talking
about
all
this,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
do
rest
on
that
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
but
you
--
but
you
also
want
to
have
an
answer
to
(inaudible)
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
if
you
want
to
have
an
answer
to
(inaudible)
then
you
better
have
the
answer.
but
the
trouble
is
you
haven't
got
the
answer
because
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
who
is
"we"
maybe
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
counsel
--
if
counsel
agrees
that
the
--
then
we've
got
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
woolsey
--
mr.
woolsey
has
a
right,
if
i
may
so,
particularly
since
he
was
appointed
by
the
court
to
do
the
best
he
can
for
his
client.
his
position
is
that
he
stand
on
the
proposition
that
the
general
rule
of
law,
which
is
that
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
other
circuits
that
the
government
urges,
is
wrong,
and
he
asks
this
court
to
reverse
it.
he
has
the
right
to
stand
on
that
proposition
of
law
and
say,
"well,
whatever
maybe
the
fact
in
the
record,
that's
for
another
day."
and
so
long
as
the
man
gets
to
retreat,
there
is
hope.
he
has
the
right
to
take
that
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
say
you
have
anything
to
suggest
you
thought
he
didn't,
but
that's
his
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
--
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
i
would
be
glad
if
you
let
me
escape,
as
i
remember,
that
a
plan,
if
the
record
is
what
it
is,
and
if
a
plan
that
one
can
argue
at
the
hearing,
the
testimony,
then
if
the
testimony
takes
it
out
of
the
single
transaction
rule
so
that
--
to
leave
your
disposition,
it
seems
a
little
--
it
seems
a
little
what
is
called
technical
for
us
to
be
deciding
that
fact
or
legal
question.
but
how
do
you
get
me
out
of
the
dilemma
that
this
record,
so
long
as
mr.
woolsey
is
righty
or
justifiably
takes
the
position
his
takes
for
his
client,
that's
all
is
before?
and
therefore,
we
have
to
ask
besides
the
abstract
question
or
they
will
decide
an
abstract
question
and
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeal.
how
do
you
get
me
out
of
that
dilemma?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
open
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
case
--
if
the
case
had
came
here
directly
from
the
district
court,
as
it
did
in
the
old
days
by
1891,
i
would
not
have
had
a
problem
because
the
district
court
says,
"i'm
familiar
with
the
fact
and
therefore,
this
court
can
get
the
basis
on
which
he
says
made
that
statement,
to
wit
the
hearings.
but
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
go
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
not
a
discretionary
right
by
certiorari,
that's
a
mandatory
right.
and
therefore,
he
is
entitled
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
on
those
facts
because
they
couldn't
have
known
those
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
difference
because
intervening
is
the
court
of
appeals
which
made
a
judgment
and
it
rested
the
judgment
on
a
proposition
of
law,
and
you
are
ready
to
support
that
proposition
of
law.
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
if
you
go
beyond
that,
then
you
ask
us
to
sustain
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
materials
that
were
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
non
constat
that
they
would
have
found
for
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
any
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
any
legal
ground
but
not
a
lot
of
facts
that
aren't
properly
before
the
court.
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can't
introduce
a
witness
before
this
court,
and
say,
"we'll
prove
something
that
wasn't
proved."
that's
what
you
are
doing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
--
are
you
saying
this,
and
i'm
not
sure
you
are
wrong,
but
are
you
saying
this,
that
in
as
much
as
this
transcription
of
the
testimony
in
the
district
court,
there
is
an
official
judicial
document
on
the
contents
of
which,
and
not
the
terms
of
which,
on
the
contents
of
which
the
district
court,
at
least,
in
part
went,
it
may
be
brought
here
as
part
of
the
whole
judicial
history
of
this
case
and
this
court
may
be
in
a
position
to
say
that
although
we
can
sustain
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
or
we
don't
have
to,
the
general
--
the
abstract
--
the
wider
proposition
on
which
it
went,
we
can
sustain
that
judgment
on
what
is
an
officially
authenticated
cases
on
which
the
district
court,
this
is
a
matter
of
speaking
judicial
notice.
that
--
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
of
this
interests
me
very
much
as
it
may
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reason
i
--
the
reason
i
indulged
in
this
colloquy,
apart
from
habit,
is
that
i
think
the
government
better
--
if
i
may
suggest,
i
think
the
government
want
to
consider
how
it
should
handle
these
2255
cases,
particularly
in
in
forma
pauperis
cases
where
there
is
any
kind
of
a
prospect
of
an
appeal
so
that
the
extra
money
that's
involved
--
i
know
we're
going
to
balance
the
budget,
but
the
extra
money
that's
involved
in
printing
the
record
can't
amount
to
very
much
in
the
number
of
cases,
so
that
we
wont
have
this
--
this
kind
of
a
problem,
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
everything
before
it.
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
--
i
--
i
may
speak
out
of
turn
and
may
not
be
a
practical
suggestion,
but
i'm
thinking
of
other
cases

not
this
case.

justice

i'm
not
suggesting
the
statute
is
this,
but
i
suppose
congress
could
provide
--
have
a
dyer
act
--
what's
the
maximum?
five
years,
and
then
provide
if,
however,
the
judge
finds
that
upon
conviction
that
the
defendant
exercised
particular
care
to
elude
detection
he
may
give
up
to
10
years
that
that
would
be
an
unquestionable
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice

i
understand
that,
i
understand
that
but
i
am
--
i
know
i'm
in
the
realm
of
constitutional
law.
but
in
construing
what
congress
did
and
trying
to
find
whether
there
was
ambiguity,
we
just
plead
up
in
the
(inaudible)
etcetera,
what
it
is
that
congress
intended
by
this
concealment
and
you
are
arguing
concealment
doesn't
mean
something
that's
inherent
part
but
of
course,
he
doesn't
want
to
be
caught
but
if
he
takes
extra
steps
to
make
it
difficult
even
for
the
fbi
to
discover
him,
that
may
make
another
offense.

is
that

that

you

whether
it's
