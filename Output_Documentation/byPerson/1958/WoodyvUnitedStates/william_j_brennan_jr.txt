justice

j.
brennan,

thank
you.
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
i
notice
that
--
what
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
am
i
correct,
is
the
order
denying
leave
in
forma
pauperis
which
is
at
page
29.
is
that
what
(inaudible)
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
significance
or
not,
but
i
notice
that
the
trial
judge
here
is
denying
that
motion
and
says
that
this
particular
proceeding
was
an
attack
upon
the
indictment
and
then
goes
on
to
say
a
matter
which
should
have
been
raised
ever
before
the
time
of
the
trial.
now,
with
this
position
on
the
ground
that
2255
did
not
apply
because
it
was
an
attack
upon
the
indictment,
it
should
have
been
made
out
before
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
referring
to
the
--
now,
this
is
at
page
29
of
the
record,
the
order
denying
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
well
--
is
this
all
that
we
have
of
--
in
the
way
of
record
of
the
action
of
the
district
court
at
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
getting
--
the
reason
i
asked
this
question,
you're
--
you're
discussing
now
a
matter
in
the
record
as
a
way
of
evidence
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
is
the
issue
before
us
whether
on
the
indictment
that
there
might
have
been
double
function?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
on
the
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
you
concede
that
that's
the
only
issue
we
have
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
then
i
get
back
in.
do
you
mean
the
disposition
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
as
a
disposition
only
of
the
attack
upon
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
(inaudible)
does
that
mean
that
the
original
trial
record
was
before
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
we
know
what
was
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that,
as
i
get
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
been
transcribed
only
since
this
case
came
into
the
court,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
meant
by
saying
the
facts
relied
upon
are
not
in
dispute
were
the
facts
whether
they
were
transcribed
or
not,
summarized
so
that
they
were
before
the
court?

well,
that's

that's
ladner,
isn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ms.
rosenberg,
perhaps
i
also
speak
out
of
turn.
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
what
i
was
discussing
with
your
earlier.
i
would
suppose,
i
gather
this
from
the
number
of
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts
that
deal
with
the
availability
of
2255,
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
on
that
question,
am
i
right
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
--
it
may
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
i'm
wondering
why
--
perhaps
you
already
have
the
procedure.
that
was
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
--
ask
earlier.
does
the
united
states
attorney
have
an
opportunity
to
contest
the
availability
of
2255
in
particular
cases
because
he
has
a
copy
of
these
applications
before
the
trial
judge
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
need
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
very
often,
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
--
that
the
issue
of
the
availability
of
either
2255
or
rule
35
or
any
of
the
other
collateral
remedies
maybe
raised
and
determined
without
reference
to
the
record
depending
upon
the
basis
upon
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
petitioner
seems
to
leave?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
kind
of
question
that
doesn't
seem
from
--
i
maybe
quite
wrong
about
this,
i'm
asking
for
information.
the
united
states
attorneys
don't
seem
to
raise
very
often.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
might
be
a
different
transaction.

plates
and
he
replaced
the

plates
with
