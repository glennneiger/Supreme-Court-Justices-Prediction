mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
violation
of
the
national
motor
vehicle
theft
act,
the
dyer
act.
billy
woody,
the
petitioner,
was
convicted
in
the
u.s.district
court
for
the
western
district
of
tennessee.
the
question
that
is
presented
under
his
conviction
is
whether
or
not
he
can
be
given
a
five
year
sentence
for
transporting
a
stolen
automobile
and
an
additional
five
years
sentence
to
be
served
consequently
for
receiving
and
concealing
the
same
automobile.
now,
the
statutes
are
--
that
are
involved
are
18
u.s.c.section
2312,
which
is
section
3
of
the
act,
which
concerns
the
transporting
and
which
provides
for
a
maximum
sentence
of
five
years
or
a
fine
of
$5000
or
both.
section
2313,
which
is
section
4
of
the
act,
imposes
similar
penalties
for
whoever
receives,
conceals,
stores,
barters,
sells
or
disposes
of
a
stolen
vehicle
which
is
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
on
june
the
24th,
1954,
the
petitioner
was
tried
before
a
jury
and
the
indictment
charging
him
with
the
crime
contained
two
counts.
count
one
stated
that
on
or
about
the
16th
of
march,
1954,
billy
g.woody
transported
in
interstate
commerce
a
certain
buick
automobile
which
it
described
from
sheffield,
alabama
to
savannah,
tennessee
knowing
it
to
be
stolen.
the
second
count
of
the
indictment
stated
that
on
or
about
march
the
16th,
the
same
date
in
1954,
the
petitioner
received
and
concealed
the
same
automobile,
which
was
then
moving
in
interstate
commerce
between
sheffield,
alabama
and
savannah,
tennessee.
the
jury
found
him
guilty
on
both
counts.
he
was
sentenced
five
years
on
the
first
count
and
fined
$125.
he
was
sentenced
five
years
on
the
second
count
and
fined
$125
with
the
sentences
to
be
served
consecutively.
now,
on
january
the
12th,
1957,
over
three
years
later,
this
petitioner
applied
to
the
district
court
for
permission
to
proceed
as
a
pauper
on
a
motion
to
vacate
the
excess
sentence.
the
district
court
dismissed
that
motion.
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
where
the
motion
was
denied
because
the
petitioner's
contention
that
multiple
punishments
had
been
inflicted,
had
long
since
been
decided
otherwise.
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
assumed
and
conceded
that
this
was
one
transaction.
the
petitioner's
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
of
october
21st,
1957
was
granted
by
this
court
on
june
the
30th,
1958.
as
we
stated,
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
assumed
and
conceded
that
the
petitioner's
conduct
was
a
single
continuous
act.
we
contend
that
it
was.
we
contend
further
that
even
though
the
dyer
act
defines
several
punishments
that
when
one
continuous
force
of
conduct
by
one
person
results
in
a
violation
of
more
than
one
section
of
that
statute,
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
multiple
cumulative
punishment
should
be
inflicted.
that
since
there
is
only
one
course
of
conduct
involved,
congress
did
not
intend
for
punishment
to
be
pyramided
and
the
cumulative
punishment
inflicted
upon
the
petitioner
was
therefore
erroneous
under
the
cases
of
this
court
dealing
with
the
fragmentation
of
crimes
for
the
purpose
of
punishment.
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
dyer
act
are
now
substantially
the
same
as
they
were
when
they
were
first
enacted,
aircraft
had
been
added.
now,
this
act
was
specifically
designed
to
punish
the
person
who
transported
a
stolen
automobile
in
interstate
commerce.
the
statements
made
by
representative
igoe
and
representative
dyer
as
well
as
by
senator
cummins,
when
this
act
was
discussed
in
congress,
indicate
that
it
was
aimed
at
the
transportation
of
automobiles,
stolen
automobiles
in
interstate
commerce.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
short
title
to
the
act
since
1940
has
read,
“an
act
to
punish
for
the
transportation
of
stolen
motor
vehicles
or
aircraft
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce”.
the
statements
of
the
member
of
congress
in
the
discussion
of
this
legislation
are
mentioned
in
our
briefs
and
also
mentioned
in
the
government's
brief.
it's
our
contention
that
they
clearly
show
that
they
were
concerned
with
stopping
the
organized
theft
of
automobile.
they
were
concerned
with
the
transporting
of
an
automobile
from
one
state
across
a
state
line
to
another
state
and
there,
turning
it
over
to
a
fence
or
a
confederate
who
thereafter
concealed,
stored
or
disposed
of
the
vehicle.
the
heart
of
the
crime,
as
discussed
by
the
gentleman
in
congress,
was
the
transportation.
but
in
order
to
completely
get
the
ring,
which
they
were
concerned
with,
section
4
was
added
to
take
care
of
the
confederate
or
fence
in
the
other
state
who
disposed
of
the
case.
we
think
that
therefore
that
section
4
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
this
other
party
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
pyramiding
punishment
on
the
person
who
violated
both
sections
of
the
act
with
one
continuous
course
of
conduct.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
don't
think
i
could
say
that,
your
honor,
if
he
is
charged
with
transporting
himself.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
because
the
very
nature
of
the
act
of
transporting
includes,
as
an
integral
part
of
the
act,
the
receipt
of
the
car
and
the
concealment
of
the
car.
and
that's
what
this
man
is
charged
with.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
that
additional
matter
of
evidence
which
you
referred
to
makes
absolutely
no
difference
and,
to
me,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
because
by
the
act
of
transporting,
he,
of
necessity,
received
the
automobile.
by
the
act
of
transporting,
we
say
that
of
necessity,
he
concealed
the
automobile.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
and
the
fact
that
he
did
more
of
the
same
thing
should
not
change
the
picture
at
all.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
well,
to
me,
at
least
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
--
that's
different.
that
--
it
impresses
me
as
a
different
situation.
our
position
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
congress
when
it
passed
this
act
that
would
justify
multiple
punishments
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
now,
if
--
if
the
court
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir,
it
is.
you
will
find
it
at
pages
4
and
5.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
if
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
on
that
motion
or
in
--
his
application
to
proceed
as
a
pauper
for
the
purpose
of
that
motion
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
--
was
appealed.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
are
you
referring
to
the
sixth
circuit?
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
not
presented
in
good
faith.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir,
that's
all.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
am
not
intending
to
discuss
that
portion
of
the
record
which
has
the
evidence
in
this
case
in
it,
which
was
printed
at
the
request
of
the
government.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
that
is
my
conception
of
the
issue.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
no,
sir.
i
--
i
--
as
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned,
it
refused
to
even
consider
his
motion,
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
said,
and
seem
to
me
to
assume
and
concede
in
its
memorandum
opinion
that
it
was
one
continuous
transaction.
but
he
said
even
so
it's
long
since
been
decided
under
the
cases
that
this
is
not
multiple
punishment.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
think
that
is
what's
before
court,
your
honor.
the
record
--
whatever
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
to
consider
in
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
--
in
this
case,
i
believe,
is
now
before
this
court.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
we
only
think
that
i
know
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
this
petitioner's
motion
to
which
he
attached
certain
exhibits
including
the
indictment
and
his
suggestions
in
support
of
his
motion
to
the
effect
that
he
had
been
inflicted
with
multiple
punishment
for
one
continuous
transaction.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
the
--
that
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
think
it
was
involved
in
the
--
in
the
filings
that
were
there.
and
as
i
understand
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
all
right,
sir.
any
record,
but
there
was
no
record
of
the
evidence
there.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
it
had
not
been
transcribed.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
interpreted
that
to
mean,
your
honor,
the
facts
as
shown
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
and
the
facts
which
the
petitioner
states
in
this
motion,
which
the
court
didn't
even
consider.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
believe
it
was
a
short
response.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
it
was
a
very
short
paragraph.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
your
honor,
i
think
it's
all
in
this
record.
everything
--
i
--
i
believe
that
everything
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeal,
exclusive
of
the
printed
testimony,
was
before
the
sixth
circuit
at
the
time
it
gave
--
handed
down
its
memorandum
opinion.
now,
that's
--
that's
my
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
would
say
that
goes
over
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
now,
should
the
court
disagree
with
our
contention
that
the
intention
of
congress
is
so
plain
and
should
there
be
any
doubt
as
to
what
congress
intended
as
to
punishment
under
the
terms
of
the
dyer
act,
then,
i
think,
under
the
holding
in
the
bell
case
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
relief
he
requests
because
this
court
has
held
that
in
those
instances
where
congress
does
not
make
its
intention
plain
and
unambiguous
in
regard
to
punishment,
that
the
court
will
construe
it
with
leniency
for
the
petitioner.
now,
while
there
has
been
some
comment
in
the
cases
rather
the
futility
of
color-matching
of
cases
in
an
instance
of
this
kind,
i
feel
that
in
justice
to
the
petitioner,
i
should
briefly
refer
to
leading
cases,
most
of
which
have
discussed
yesterday
and
today
on
this
point.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
that's
my
understanding,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
would
like
to
review
these
cases
for
the
purpose
of
showing
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
--
that
under
any
test
laid
down
by
any
of
these
cases
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
--
the
petitioner
is
still
entitled
to
the
relief
which
he
request.
the
first
case
in
line,
albrecht
against
the
united
states
where
the
defendant
was
convicted
for
possession
and
sale
of
the
same
liquor.
the
distinction,
as
i
understand,
of
the
court
in
that
case
was
that
i
may
possess
liquor
and
not
sell
it.
i
may
sell
it
and
not
possess
it,
therefore,
congress
intended
to
provide
punishment
for
each
step.
now,
there's
a
direct
contrast
in
our
case.
it's
our
contention
that
by
the
very
nature
of
the
act,
it
is
highly
improbable,
if
not
impossible,
for
the
transporter
of
a
stolen
vehicle,
not
only
to
transport
but
to
receive
and
also
conceal,
the
very
nature
of
the
act
includes
all.
consequently,
it
is
one
transaction,
which
is
not
the
case
in
albrecht,
as
i
understand
the
opinion
of
the
court.
in
united
states
against
adams,
the
officer
of
a
federal
reserve
bank,
one
in
the
system,
had
made
two
entries
to
accomplish
the
fraudulent
receipt
of
$75,000,
both
entries
had
reference
to
the
same
transaction
were
of
correlated
means
of
accomplishing
a
single
fraud.
the
statute
punished
any
officer
of
a
bank
who
made
any
false
entry
with
the
intent
to
defraud.
the
court
held
that
the
mere
multiplication
of
the
entry,
all
at
the
same
point
and
with
a
single
intent
should
not
multiply
the
punishment.
they
had
one
statute,
one
amount
was
obtained
by
two
entries,
both
aimed
at
the
same
purpose.
in
our
case,
we
have
one
statute,
we
have
one
automobile
but
it
was
transported,
received
and
concealed
in
one
continuous
transaction
by
one
party,
billy
woody.
blockburger
against
the
united
states,
as
i
understand
it,
held
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
one
continuous
transaction
contained
separate
offenses
or
whether
or
not
it
should
be
broken
down,
that
the
test
was
whether
or
not
the
proof
required,
the
evidence
required
to
sustain
a
conviction
on
one
count
would
also,
without
additional
evidence,
sustain
a
conviction
on
the
second
count.
now,
the
two
of
the
charges
laid
against
this
petitioner,
sections
3
and
4,
in
our
opinion,
required
exactly
the
same
evidence,
no
additional
evidence
required
because
the
act
of
transportation
includes
receipt
and
concealment.
michener
against
the
united
states
concerned
the
(inaudible)
rights.
under
the
terms
of
the
dissent
in
that
case,
i
think
also
that
our
case,
this
petitioner's
request
should
be
granted
because
the
receipt
and
concealment
of
this
automobile,
which
he
transported,
were
but
an
incident
to
the
transportation
which
was
charged
in
the
first
count
and
the
concealment
was
an
integral
part
of
the
unlawful
transportation.
united
states
against
c.i.t.credit
corporation
concerned
an
indictment
in
32
counts.
the
act
provided
for
$10,000
for
violation
of
any
provision
and
the
question
presented
was
whether
or
not
a
fine
of
$320,000
should
be
imposed.
this
court
said
no.
the
offense
punishable
under
the
act
was
for
a
course
of
conduct,
that
the
violation
arose
from
a
singleness
of
thought
from
a
single
impulse
or
conception
and
that
therefore,
it
is
subject
to
one
file.
likewise
in
our
case,
the
petitioner's
transportation
receipt
and
concealment
of
the
stolen
automobile
is
one
course
of
conduct,
one
offense
from
a
single
thought,
purpose
or
action.
and
as
to
him,
the
aggregate
of
these
acts
is
a
single
course
of
conduct
and
we
contend
the
single
offense.
bell
against
the
united
states
i
have
discussed
in
connection
with
the
intention
of
congress,
it
involved
the
mann
act,
two
women
transported
by
one
man
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
car.
the
court
held
that
there
was
only
one
offense.
now,
neither
from
the
congressional
history
of
this
act
or
from
the
act,
itself,
can
you,
in
my
opinion,
come
to
any
conclusion
except
this
was
one
single
transaction,
the
heart
of
which
was
the
transportation
and
as
a
part
of
which,
which
merged
with
the
transportation,
the
receipt
and
concealment.
prince
against
the
united

involved
a
bank
robbery
section.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
it
does.
i
think
the
car
is
just
as
efficiently
concealed
when
he
drives
it
away
as
it
is
when
he
puts
it
in
the
garage,
repaints
it
or
does
anything
else
to
it.
it's
certainly
concealed
from
the
owner
of
the
automobile,
it's
gone.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
now,
that's
provided,
of
course,
your
honor,
that
--
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
go
in
to
that
portion
of
the
record
which
the
government
has
had
printed,
which
concerns
the
evidence.
now,
i
think
that
evidence
puts
my
man
in
a
bad
spot,
but
i
don't
think
it
changes
the
situation
one
bit.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
think
not,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
no,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
now,
there
were
some
mentioned
by
the
trial
judge
of
continuous
acts
on
the
part
of
this
petitioner
to
gain
some
relief
whether
or
not
this
was
the
first,
second
or
third
petition
filed
for
the
correction
of
the
sentence
and
a
motion
to
correct
the
sentence,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor,
nor
can
i
answer
your
question
as
to
how
many
there.
i
--
my
information
is
limited
to
exactly
yours
in
respect
to
the
court
--
district
court's
state.
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
the
prince
case,
in
two
counts,
involved
entering
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony
and
the
same
individual,
the
one
who
had
committed
the
robbery,
and
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
consecutively
sentences
on
each
count.
this
court
held
that
the
statute,
although
dealing
with
the
limited
purpose
and
with
an
inconclusive
legislative
history,
that
this
was
a
continuous
transaction
and
that
the
intent
to
commit
felony
merged
with
the
completed
crime
of
robbery.
now,
it's
our
contention
that
the
transportation,
the
receipt
and
the
concealment
provisions
of
the
dyer
act
were
designed
primarily
to
punish
the
transportation
of
stolen
automobile,
that
the
concealment,
as
well
as
the
receipt,
merged
with
the
act
of
transportation.
gore
against
the
united
states,
in
discussing
the
blockburger
case,
mentions
not
only
the
fact
concerning
additional
evidence
to
establish
the
crime
under
different
counts
but
also
mentions
the
fact
that
the
three
laws
which
are
involved
in
blockburger,
and
i
think
also
in
gore,
were
--
had
different
times
of
origination
and
were
for
different
purposes.
i
think
1909,
1914
and,
i
believe,
1925,
but
they
--
the
sections
were
passed
at
different
times
and
had
a
different
origin
in
time
and
purpose
which
is
not
the
case
here.
this
act
was
passed
with
the
two
sections
in
it.
it
has
been
amended
to
include
aircraft
but
it
has
not
been
substantially
changed
in
any
respect.
therefore,
we
say
that
congress
intended
to
punish
as
a
single
offense
when
both
violations
arose
through
a
continuous
single
transaction.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
it's
my
sincere
feeling,
your
honor,
that
this
case
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
with
an
order
to
correct
this
sentence
and
to
eliminate
the
second
five-year
term
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
--
which
was
to
be
served
in
sentence.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
now,
the
facts
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
as
i
understand
it,
yes.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
well,
the
--
the
thing
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
well,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
about
this
indictment,
if
you
are
going
to
consider
the
other
testimony
in
this
case,
which
is
in
the
record,
is
this,
and
it
may
be
of
no
importance,
but
it
--
it
bothers
me.
this
indictment
says
that
on
or
about
the
16th
of
march.
he
not
only
transported
but
he
received
and
conceived
on
the
same
dates,
both
counts.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
portion
of
the
brief
that
the
government
has
printed
or
the
portion
of
the
record
and
in
their
brief,
they
--
they
show
that
--
that
this
automobile
was
stolen
on
the
2nd
of
march
and
recovered
on
the
8th
of
april,
that
on
the
3rd
of
march,
this
petitioner
applied
for
a
license
in
sheffield,
alabama
for
that
automobile
and
used
a
motor
number
which
was
incorrect.
it
was
a
changed
motor
number.
it
also
shows
that
on
the
16th
of
march,
this
petitioner
and
another
man
went
back
to
sheffield,
alabama,
i
believe
it
was,
and
a
bill
of
sale
was
executed
to
this
petitioner.
this
testimony
will
also
show
that
on
the
1st
of
april,
this
petitioner
painted
this
buick,
which
was
a
two-tone
black
and
yellow
car,
all
black.
he
did
it
out
in
the
road
or
out
in
the
open
by
the
side
of
a
busy
highway
with
a
blanket
or
some
sort
of
a
cover
thrown
over
the
fence.
why
that
was
there?
i
don't
know.
but
one
explanation
is
to
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
dust
on
the
paint,
the
new
paint.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
pardon
me?
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
another
would
be
that
he
was
trying
to
hide
the
automobile
obviously,
but
if
you
--
if
you
accept
my
premise,
which
--
which,
i
believe
sincerely,
he
conceals
that
when
he
drives
it
off,
it's
just
as
lost,
just
as
concealed
from
the
man
that
owned
that
automobile,
as
if
he
dug
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
covered
it
up.
and
i
say
the
fact
that
he
does
more
concealment
add
nothing
to
him.
now,
on
or
about,
it
was
about
--
takes
you
as
far
back
as
the
3rd
of
march,
13
days,
seems
quite
a
way
to
go
to
me.
thank
you.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
no,
sir,
there
is
not.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
i
do
not
dispute.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
in
connection
with
the
persons
who
transports
and
sells.
i
believe
that
in
reply,
i
indicated
that
there
were
two
separate
punishable
offenses.
i
now
believe
i'm
inaccurate
in
that.
the
answer
is
this.
i
think
that
under
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
which
says
nothing
about
the
type
of
punishment
the
government
insists
upon
in
this
case,
that
the
prosecutor
is
given
a
choice
as
to
which
section
he
should
proceed
under
in
the
case
of
one
person,
transporting
and
selling
the
automobile,
the
same
with
one
person
transporting
and
storing.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
no,
sir,
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
think
they
have
two
avenues
to
proceed
upon.
if
one
man
transported
and
sold
this
automobile
--
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
--
then,
i
think,
from
the
legislative
history,
all
they
intended
to
give
this
prosecutor
was
the
choice,
let
him
take
his
choice
as
to
which
avenue
he
should
proceed
in
rather
than
bundle
him
together
or
put
him
in
two
counts
and
give
this
man
multiple
punishment
for
one
transaction.
as
far
as
this
transcript
is
concerned,
i
--
as
i
understand,
i
am
justified
in
the
position
that
it
should
be
limited
to
the
first
52
pages.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
in
the
first
52
pages.
if
i
am
sustained
in
that
position,
i
understand
this
court
can
decide
this
on
the
question
raised
by
the
petitioner.
if,
however,
the
balance
of
this
record,
which
was
supplied
by
the
government,
can
be
considered,
i
am
still
in
no
position
and
i
cannot
dispute
the
truth
of
the
facts
which
are
stated
therein.
consequently,
i
think
that
takes
us
away
from
the
ladner
case.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
dispute,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
court
can,
if
it
decides
to
consider
this
additional
record,
dispose
of
this
case
on
the
question
raised.
mr.
clarence
o.
woolsey
privilege
is
mine,
your
honor.
