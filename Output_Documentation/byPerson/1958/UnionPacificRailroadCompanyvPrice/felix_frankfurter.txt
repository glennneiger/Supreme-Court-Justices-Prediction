justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
says
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
statute
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
didn't
--
this
was
an
independent
proceeding
you
say
for
the
very
subject
matter
that
on
which
he
chose
to
go
to
the
board
to
have
an
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
go
to
the
court,
complaining
that
the
board
violated
some
requirements
of
the
statue,
and
thereby
exceeded
its
authority
or
that
the
board
acted
in
violation
of
the
due
process
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
therefore
not
a
--
what
might
be
called
the
collateral
review
of
what
the
board
did
or
didn't
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
but
the
proceeding
of
the
case
--
the
complaint
in
this
case,
if
the
complaint
like
the
(inaudible)
and
not
complaining
that
what
the
board
did,
violated
--
exceeded
its
fee
limit,
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
or
it
exercised
its
jurisdiction
in
an
unconstitutional
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
question
--
that
question
maybe
in
contrast
but
there
are
--
there
are
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
into
cases,
is
your
theory
that
in
the
second
sentence
of
this
case,
there
really
was
no
proceeding
for
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
second
--
that's
the
second,
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
start
out
by
saying
that
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
this
is
an
independent
(inaudible)
moore
proceeding,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
know
now
narrated
again
what
took
place
before
the
board,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
i
ask
you
whether
you
claim
that
in
fact
there
was
no
legally
significant
proceeding
before
the
board
and
therefore
you
emphasize
moore's
position.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'd
like
to
know
why
--
the
why
of
your
answer
to
justice
brennan.
is
it
--
does
that
mean
--
he
couldn't
get
the
relief
he
asked
and
he
can
then
go
to
court
and
get
the
relief
he
want,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
didn't
get
the
kind
of
a
hearing
you
should
have
done
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
not
the
terms
of
the
circumstances
in
this
particular
case.
we're
not
resting
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
what
happened
at
the
board
that
gives
him
at
least
a
common-law
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
on
your
first
point,
you
stick
to
that
for
a
moment
but
you
say
because
those
are
the
kind
of
things
that
happened
before
the
board.
that's
one
reason
why
the
statute
is
to
be
so
construed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
suppose
they
say
yes
he
can
stay
with
his
job,
give
him
a
money
award
that
he
deems
insufficient,
the
one
(inaudible)
and
he
rejects
that.
according
to
your
theory
you
could
start
a
common-law
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
deems
to
be
is
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
giving
prima
facie
way
to
defining
the
board,
it's
inconsistent
when
saying
there's
a
trial
de
novo.
as
i
understand,
trial
de
novo
means
begin
all
over
again.
you
don't
begin
all
over
again
if
you
begin
with
low
desire
--
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
all
i'm
saying
is
that
it
isn't
de
novo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
no
difference
in
your
mind
between
starting
a
proceeding
and
having
action
by
the
board
--
and
not
starting
a
proceeding
and
having
action
before
the
board
--
was
it
a
saying,
can
you
take
or
block
out
a
sentence
like
that
in
a
situation
in
which
you
didn't
have
in
which
there
was
a
vital
difference
and
if
there
is
between
your
case
in
that
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
where
--
where
a
common-law
right
was
invoked
and
not
where
the
machinery
of
the
board
was
taught
to
be
utilized
and
(inaudible).
the
whole
point
of
the
railway
labor
board
--
the
whole
--
the
essence
of
that
legislation
is
to
hold
cases
that
would
never
get
into
court.
that's
before
(inaudible)
putting
the
message
and
asking
congress
to
--
to
enact
of
that
which
the
two
powerful
organizations
can
agree
upon.
and
the
hope
was
through
the
--
in
turn
of
administration
in
the
first
place,
things
will
be
settled
within
this
system
and
second,
if
they're
not
settled
within
the
system,
it
will
be
settled
by
the
machinery
of
the
two
parties
to
give
them
administrative
machinery.
and
it
was
expected,
there
--
there
would
be
no
resort
to
court
because
the
experience
with
the
court
is
eventually
a
railroad
dispute
and
it
was
not
like
a
policeman
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
taken
away
from
(voice
overlap)
he
didn't
exercise
it
until
after
he
didn't
get
what
he
wanted
from
the
board.
it
wasn't
taken
away
from
him.
that
would
be
--
that's
the
decision
of
moore
that
it
couldn't
be
taken
away
from
him.
but
he
chose
not
to
exercise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doctrine
of
the
election
of
remedies
doesn't
require
that
a
statute
should
provide
for
it,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
congress
from
establishing
a
separate
system
of
dealing
with
controversies
between
railroads
and
their
employees
and
saying
that
the
machinery
doing
that
can
be
deemed
final
and
say,
fine,
there
is
no
merit
to
the
course
and
nothing
have
rest
there.
is
there
anything
of
the
constitution
of
united
states
prevents
that
and
saying
that
if
you
get
a
money
award
and
then
you
go
through
your
usual
business
of
enforcing
it
and
then
you
go
to
court.
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
prevents
the
scheme
from
being
formulated,
legalized
by
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
may
there
not
be
a
controversy
as
to
the
amount
after
an
award
is
given
by
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
what
happened.
i
understand
that
this
was
intended
to
be
federal
(inaudible)
in
the
way
in
which
i
(inaudible)
a
minute
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
if
there
are
--
there
may
be
controversy
as
to
how
much
back
pay,
is
--
is
there
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
there
is
such
one,
who
fixes
the
dollar
and
cents
value
of
the
award?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
and
then
--
and
when
they
fix
that,
you
go
on
that
dollar
and
cents
award
to
the
district
or
to
the
employees
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
that
dollar
and
cents
award.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
justice
brennan's
question
was
whether
the
court
could
go
beyond
the
amount
fixed
by
the
board.
