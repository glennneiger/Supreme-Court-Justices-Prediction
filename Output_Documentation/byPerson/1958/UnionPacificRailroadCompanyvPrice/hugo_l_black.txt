justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
consequence
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
provision
copied
from
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
united
states
against
illinois
commerce
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
bearing
do
you
think
that
has
on
that
subject?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here,
you
think
that
this
man
did
have
an
election,
is
that
what
you're
thinking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
face
that
in
--
quite
a
different
category
to
--
in
which
a
man
did
not
elected
to
go
before
the
board
and
you
said
then
he
could
go
to
the
court
but
if
you
elected
to
go
before
the
board,
he
can't
litigate
the
denial
of
this
award.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
there
had
been
a
money
award,
what
could
the
company
have
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
law
provides
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
case
--
if
the
case
goes
against
the
employee,
the
railroad
can
take
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
goes
far
in
any
--
goes
far
to
the
employee,
i
should
have
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
railroads
can
take
it
to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
railroad
doesn't
have
to
pay
it.
there's
no
way
to
make
the
railroad
pay
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
--
no
legal
way
to
make
them
pay
it
under
the
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
board
decides
against
the
employee,
there's
no
such
right
he's
going
to
get
it
in
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
a
case
last
week
and
he
was
retired
employee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
suppose
the
board
had
awarded
you
$118,517
and
you
had
filed
a
suit
in
the
court,
what
would
have
been
the
difference
in
your
complaint
then
and
your
complaint
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
alleged
in
this
complaint
that
the
discharge
was
based
on
--
i've
just
read
it,
what's
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
suppose
you
had
been
awarded
for
$118,000m
you've
got
--
will
you
have
alleged
precisely
that?
it's
true
that
you
can
--
when
you
put
in
your
evidence
and
offered
the
findings,
prima
facie
evidence,
but
what's
the
difference
in
the
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
that's
why
i
don't
quite
understand
your
--
the
distinction
you've
been
drawing
about
a
common-law
suit
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
it
be
for
the
suit
for
the
wrongful
discharge
with
the
right
to
trial
and
with
the
added
right
on
your
part
to
have
the
benefit
of
a
prima
facie
proof
like
a
man
would
have
if
he's
charged
--
he's
been
killed
and
he
said
it
was
an
accident
and
he
has
a
presumption
in
his
favor.
what's
the
difference
except
eventually
between
the
kind
of
law
suits
you've
filed
here
and
the
one
you've
filed,
you've
got
a
--
an
award?
what
would
you
have
to
allege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
you
have
to
allege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
have
to
allege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
will
do
that
to
get
the
benefit
of
your
presumption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
--
wouldn't
you
have
to
allege
if
you've
been
wrongfully
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
have
a
lawsuit
for
being
wrongfully
discharged
without
alleging
you're
wrongfully
discharged,
even
to
enforcing
that
it
has
given
you
an
award?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
could
you
get
a
verdict?
is
it
bound
--
are
you
bound
to
get
a
verdict
for
the
full
$118,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
bound
to
get
less?
are
--
are
you
--
are
you
prohibited
by
the
act
in
getting
any
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
act
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
gives
you
an
action
does
it
not
to
enforce
something
--
enforce
something
which
has
been
done
and
what
you
allege
is
a
wrongful
discharge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
makes
certain
--
prima
facie
certain
findings
--
what
else
does
it
do
besides
that
in
the
act
--
language
of
the
act
so
far
as
that
lawsuit
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
it
means
by
other
suits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
sue
him
--
you
sue
him
because
(inaudible)
because
of
that,
he
was
wrongfully
discharged
and
they
could
say
in
addition
to
see
it
exactly
as
other
suits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
that
you
can
also
certain
finding
as
prima
facie
evidence
as
anything
else
takes
away
from
there.
it
makes
it
any
different
to
any
other
lawsuit.
it's
the
reason
why
the
railroad
there
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
a
jury
if
it
wants
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
action
as
in
other
suit
for
the
same
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
want
to
decide
that
when
you
can
decide
it
on
some
other
issue.
i
thought
you
would
follow
the
course
(inaudible)
to
raise
a
constitutional
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
--
is
there
anything
in
this
act
that
requires
any
constitutional
interpretation
as
to
what
is
said
when
it
said
that
suits
can
be
filed
as
others.
does
that
--
is
there
anything
that
violates
the
constitution
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
is
the
difference
in
saying
that
an
employee
here,
like
a
shipper
under
the
i.c.c.
act
in
which
this
was
wrong,
but
this
act
should
be
interpreted
giving
him
the
right
to
file
a
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
he's
denied
an
award.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
were
they
tried
like
any
other
lawsuits?
you
mean
they're
limited
to
it?
can
--
can
a
railroad
get
out
for
less?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
would
imagine,
but
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
trial
of
that
lawsuit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
the
railroad
not
have
the
right
to
have
that
tried
like
any
other
lawsuit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
it's
tried
for
the
discharged
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
to
discharging
a
man
wrongfully?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
not
have
the
right
to
have
it
tried
besides
these
any
other
lawsuits
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
if
this
award
should
be
prima
facie
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
against
the
railroad
otherwise
it's
tried
like
any
other
lawsuits
for
a
wrongful
discharge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
know.
