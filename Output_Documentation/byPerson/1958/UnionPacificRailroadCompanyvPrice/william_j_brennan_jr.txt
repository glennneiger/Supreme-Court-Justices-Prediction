justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
you've
just
said
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
purpose
that
language
that
you
read
to
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
finding
on
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
how
much
--
what's
the
significance
of
the
later
interpretation
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
rely
upon
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
it
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
be
that
as
it
may,
mr.
wilcox.
am
i
right
in
taking
that
none
--
that
this
very
interesting
issue
is
not
before
is
in
this
case,
the
reviewability
of
a
negative
money
award.
it's
not
the
issue
here
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
was
independent
common-law
action
for
damages,
i'm
right
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
see.
does
that
mean
even
though
these
were
a
determination
on
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
loses
before
the
board,
he
may
nevertheless,
relitigate
the
issue
of
discharge
in
an
action
for
his
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
you
really
go
this
far
mr.
lionel,
i
thought
i
understood
this
from
your
answer
to
me
earlier.
you're
in
effect
saying
that
he
was
privileged
to
litigate
before
the
board
the
merits
of
this
discharge
based
upon
his
insistence
that
he
was
improperly
discharged
and
was
still
an
employee
and
he
could
have
the
fullest
hearing
on
the
facts
in
that
regard
and
if
decided
adversely
to
him,
he
then
was
free
to
maintain
the
action
that
is
now
brought
for
wages,
putting
again
an
issue
in
this
independent
floor
action,
the
legitimacy
of
this
discharge.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
usual
practice
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
there
are
no
formal
hearings
about
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
adjustment
board
proceedings
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
it
in
the
sense
of
the
fullest
kind
of
hearing
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
determination
going
against
him,
having
been
determined
on
the
merits
that
he
was
properly
discharged
then
he
may
litigate
over
again
in
an
independent
action
in
the
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lionel,
was
there
in
this
case
any
question
of
interpretation
of
this
clause
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
whether
the
submission
involved
a
question
of
interpretation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
a
question
of
interpretation
involved
in
this
common-law
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
that
--
didn't
that
involve
a
consideration
of
the
meaning
of
that
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
that.
you
mean,
an
enforcement
proceeding
if
you
would
have
an
award
from
the
board
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what's
the
practice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
they
limit
the
employees'
recovery
in
the
enforcement
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
--
do
the
findings
of
the
board
--
let's
--
in
this
case,
if
there
had
been
an
award
of
--
for
the
employee
of
$50,000
by
the
board
and
the
railroad
didn't
pay
and
they
brought
an
enforcement
proceeding
under
the
statute,
might
he
recover
in
that
enforcement
proceeding
$118,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
enforcement
proceeding,
what's
--
what's
the
ultimate
judgment
of
the
court
and
the
judgments
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
