justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
lionel,
you
say,
the
search
for
an
administrative
remedy
does
not
preclude
an
action
of
law.
what
if
--
what
if
he
had
been
awarded
reinstatement
and
back
pay
by
the
board,
could
he
then
have
brought
this
action
of
law
for
damages
for
a
wrongful
discharge?
justice
potter
stewart
--
damage
reputation
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
even
if
he
had
succeeded
in
this
administrative
remedy
and
the
admin
--
and
the
administrative
body,
the
board
had
given
him
all
that
it
could
give
and
all
that
he
asked.
he
could
still
bring
this
independent
and
independent
suit
of
law
growing
out
of
the
same
discharge.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
--
that
opinion
and
very
frankly,
i've
never
read
it.
it
certainly
hasn't
been
--
united
states
against
interstate
commerce
commission.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
that
opinion
involves
reviewability
of
a
negative
award?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
you
stated
at
the
very
outset,
that
is
not
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
question
of
reviewability
of
a
negative
money
award
by
the
adjustment
board
is
--
is
an
interesting
issue
but
one
certainly
is
not
--
not
present
in
this
case,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
enforcement
proceeding
have
been
quoted
to
the
district
court,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
have
to
do
more
than
allege
that
you'd
receive
an
award,
this
was
it,
and
the
railroad
had
not
abated?
