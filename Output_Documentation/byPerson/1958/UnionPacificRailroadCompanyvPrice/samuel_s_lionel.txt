mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
your
honors
indicated
before,
this
is
an
independent
common-law
action.
we
do
not
seek
review
of
the
action
by
the
court.
our
position
briefly
is
this
that
the
case
is
taken
to
the
board,
regardless
of
what
its
award
is,
a
discharged
railroad
employee
nevertheless
has
right
to
go
into
a
federal
district
court
or
a
state
court
and
invoke
his
common-law
remedy.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
your
honor,
that's
our
position.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
our
first
position.
our
second
position
is
assuming
that
finality
would
occur
or
the
election
of
remedies
does
in
fact
exist
that
certainly
in
the
case
where
the
board
has
not
determined
the
case
upon
the
merits
that
then
he
still
has
the
right
to
litigate
in
a
common-law
action.
i
would
like
briefly
to
just
allude
to
the
facts.
i
think
that
union
pacific
counsel
has
perhaps
not
made
it
clear
as
they
should
be
from
the
standpoint
of
time.
in
this
case,
mr.
price
was
sent
from
las
vegas
to
nipton
and
this
is
about
56
miles
and
i
believe
9:25
in
the
evening.
he
called
up
about
10
--
10:30
approximately
10:30
in
the
evening
from
nipton,
and
said
there
was
no
place
to
eat.
i
want
to
come
back
to
las
vegas
to
eat.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
that
he
would
give
his
interpretation
of
any
kind
of
a
collective
agreement
at
that
particular
time.
he
was
told
not
to
come
back
and
he
came
back
to
eat.
i
would
like
at
this
point
just
very
briefly,
to
read
--
to
quote
article
32
(b)
of
the
collective
agreement
which
provides
“swing
brakemen
will
not
be
tied
up
nor
released
at
points
where
sleeping
and
eating
accommodations
are
not
available.”
in
my
mind,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
there
that
is
so
difficult
to
be
construed.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
clear.
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any
question
as
to
what
that
means
either
there
are
or
there
are
not
eating
and
sleeping
facilities
available
at
a
place.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
true.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
they
are.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
precisely.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that,
we
will
dispute,
that
is
so.
but
i
just
--
the
point
i
wish
to
make
clear
was
that
when
he
came
back
to
las
vegas,
he
telephoned
and
said
i
have
now
eaten,
do
you
want
me
to
go
back
out
there,
an
a
certain
train
which
train
would
have
arrived
at
nipton
at
1:25
in
the
morning.
his
job
was
to
protect
the
train
at
4
o'clock
if
that
was
necessary.
he
was
supposed
to
call
in
at
3:20
in
the
morning.
but
the
chronology
with
respect
to
the
investigation
is
this.
this
occurred
on
the
morning
of
the
12.
at
the
time,
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
were
in
controversy,
because
the
railroad
had
just
started
to
drop
the
swing
brakeman
about
two
weeks
before,
out
here
at
nipton
in
the
desert.
as
a
result,
the
matter
has
been
taken
to
the
national
mediation
board.
and
on
the
15th
of
july,
an
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood
that
the
railroad
would
no
longer
put
swing
brakemen
out
here
in
nipton.
they
would
use
the
old
place
they
had,
chelsea
which
was
a
station
nearby.
now,
on
the
morning
of
the
16th,
the
day
following
this
agreement,
mr.
price
gets
a
notice
of
hearing
from
the
assistant
superintendent
here
in
las
vegas
saying
that's
going
to
be
you're
suspended.
there
will
be
an
investigation
and
hearing
tomorrow
on
your
insubordination.
he
showed
up
the
next
morning
and
he
said,
“i
don't
have
a
witness.
my
witness
is
here.
a
railroad
man
and
he
had
gone
out.”
and
the
notice
of
investigation
which
he
received
said,
“you
may
present
witnesses
at
your
own
expense.”
in
other
words,
you'd
have
to
pay
the
man.
he
was
granted
a
continuance
until
the
following
day
when
he
appeared
and
asked
for
another
extension
because
the
representative
that
he
wanted
to
have
is
brotherhood
chairman
was
--
had
been
sent
out
by
the
railroad
the
night
before.
the
same
assistant
superintendent
said,
“you'll
be
here
this
afternoon
at
2
o'clock
and
you
get
another
representative
at
2
o'clock.”
mr.
price
wasn't
there.
a
hearing
was
held
by
the
assistant
representative,
no
transcript
of
any
kind.
all
we
have
is
a
series
of
questions
and
answers
guided
by
the
assistant
clerk
and
the
assistant
superintendent
--
to
the
clerk
the
assistant
superintendent
does
all
records
that
went
up
later
on
to
the
adjustment
board.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
this
little
transcript
indicates
that
after
these
witnesses
at
least
apparently
were
heard
and
apparently
subsequently
reduced
in
writing
some
form
of
these
questions
and
answers,
the
same
assistant
superintendent
said
being
there
know
what
--
this
is
here
for
mr.
price,
no
evidence
and
the
investigation
is
closed.
that
is
the
sum
total
of
the
hearing
which
ultimately
here
appears
to
have
so
far
deprived
mr.
price
valuable
contract
rights
which
he
has
under
the
collective
agreement.
now,
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
our
first
contention
namely
that
here,
a
person,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
case
has
gone
to
the
board
or
even
if
the
board
has
held
adversely
to
him
on
the
merits,
he
has
the
right
to
go
into
a
suit
--
a
court
and
litigate
on
the
basis
of
a
common-law
action.
the
key
case
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
there
was
a
proceeding
but
no
determination
upon
the
merits.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
there
was
a
complete
misconstruction
of
his
submission.
they
did
not
answer
the
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
second
--
second
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
exactly.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no.
well,
i
say
our
position
is
not
as
good
as
moore
because
of
the
fact
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
our
first
point.
moore
did
not
go
to
the
board.
in
my
first
point,
we
assume
that
our
men
went
to
the
board
and
they
held
and
they
term
it
against
it.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
except
for
one
thing,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
that
is
there
could
not
have
been
any
possible
opportunity
for
a
full
litigation
of
the
facts
in
that
priority
case
because
under
the
procedure
before
the
board,
they
apparently
just
had
the
transcript
up
there
and
this
particular
case
--
there
was
no
oral
argument
of
any
kind.
it
was
just
a
submission
made
by
the
brotherhood
in
his
behalf
which
is
contained
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
the
usual
practice.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no
form
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
available
within
the
purview
of
the
railway
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--
labor
act.
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
my
first
position.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
points
which
was
raised
in
the
elgin-burley
case
here
and
the
court
reserved
decision
finding
unnecessary
to
answer
it
because
they
remand
it
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
brotherhood
was
properly
authorized
by
the
individuals
involved.
now,
in
the
moore
case
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
in
substance,
i
am
saying
that
the
relief
--
the
administrative
remedy
granted
by
the
act
does
not
preclude
a
subsequent
court
action.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
--
i
--
it's
my
view
that
he
should
not
be
deprived
of
this
common-law
remedy
because
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
not
on
my
first
point.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
precisely.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
would
say
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
say
yes.
i
say
yes
based
upon
my
interpretation
to
moore
case
and
certain
other
cases.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
let
me
say
that
if
it
granted
him
reinstatement
and
back
pay
that
he
accepted
that
then
we
certainly
would
have
another
question
presented
that
if
--
if
he
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--
if
he
remained
an
employee,
he
certainly
would
not
be
in
the
moore
situation.
he
would
not
be
(inaudible)
i
think
then.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
think
it's
not
at
present
but
i
think
that
may
be
not
necessarily
concomitant
of
my
theory.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
think
that
would
possibly
follow.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
possibly
follow.
but
of
course
we
must
not
overlook
this
fact
but
--
that
if
he
won
before
the
board
and
they
had
ordered
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
where
would
he
be
if
the
railroad
said,
“we
still
don't
want
to
give
it
to
you.”
he
would
have
to
bring
in
an
enforcement
suit
and
in
that
enforcement
suit,
the
findings
of
the
board
would
be
merely
prima
facie
evidence
and
there
would
be
a
trial
de
novo.
now,
i
can't
believe
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
enacting
1934
amendments
to
place
an
employee
in
that
particular
position.
and
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
words
final
and
binding
were
not
intended
to
preclude
this.
i
think
they
intended
to
cover
a
situation
more
like
that
in
the
chicago-trainmen
case.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it's
the
old
question
of
what
is
--
how
much
--
how
loaded
is
your
presumption
or
findings.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
we
have
a
case
here,
the
dober
case
in
the
third
circuit
which
i
quote
in
my
brief
here
where
employees
sought
seniority
rights
under
their
collective
agreement.
they
went
before
the
board
and
the
board
held
they
were
entitled
to
this
collective
--
to
these
seniority
rights
under
this
collective
agreement.
the
board
refused
to
go
along
with
it.
they
brought
an
enforcement
suit
and
the
--
a
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
board
was
wrong
in
saying
they
were
entitled
to
these
seniority
rights.
there
--
there
the
employee
said
final
and
binding.
this
time
they
want
to
use
it
and
the
courts
didn't
know.
this
is
not
final
and
binding
and
dismissed
the
complaint
in
the
enforcement
suit
even
with
the
--
no
matter
how
loaded
they
may
have
been
by
raising
those
prima
facie
findings.
but
the
board
there
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case
of
the
third
circuit
said,
this
--
it
was
not
final
and
binding
on
the
same
provision
of
law.
now,
in
the
moore
case
and
that
was
actually
a
case
which
was
an
exhausted
case.
in
that
case,
there,
the
railroad
claim
that
the
employee
having
failed
to
go
before
the
board,
he
could
not
come
in
under
the
common-law
action.
the
board
said,
“no,
we
did
not.
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedy
going
to
the
board
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
filing
a
common-law
action,"
but
this
court
used
this
language.
we
find
nothing
in
that
act
which
purports
to
take
away
from
the
courts
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
controversy
over
a
wrongful
discharge
or
to
make
that
administrative
finding
a
prerequisite
to
filing
a
suit
in
court.
so
this
court
is
saying,
“we
see
nothing."
nothing
at
all
in
the
railway
labor
act
to
take
away
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
to
determine
a
wrongful
discharge
case,
and
that
i
think
is
in
effect
what
the
union
pacific
railroad
is
contending
here.
they
are
saying
that
this
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
because
this
particular
finality
provision
in
the
railway
labor
act
says
it's
final
and
binding.
this
court
apparently
did
not
think
so
in
the
moore
case.
i
can
see
the
question
was
not
presented
but
i
think
the
language
is
clear
and
in
the
slocum
case
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
but
i
--
i
think
in
this
moore
case,
there
was
a
--
a
very
close
examination
made
of
the
legislative
intent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
was
asked
to
file
a
brief
amicus
--
an
amicus
brief
which
it
did.
and
on
page
40
of
that
brief,
it
concluded
that
we
think
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
machinery
established
in
the
railway
labor
act
to
deprive
any
individual
or
group
of
all
means
of
protecting
the
rights
granted
on
the
collective
labor
agreements.
now,
i
think
here
was
a
right
which
he
had.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
that
i
have
--
i
--
i
incur
mr.
justice
frankfurter
with
that,
but
i
think
here
is
a
case
we
are
talking
only
about
an
individual.
the
prime
purpose
of
these
amendments
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
warren
in
chicago-trainmen
case
was
to
have
this
compulsory
arbitration
so
that
there
would
be
no
strikes.
but
i
think
with
respect
to
an
individual
here
that
there
was
no
intent
in
the
railway
labor
act
to
take
away
his
common-law
rights
and
that
i
feel
is
what
this
court
said
in
the
moore
case
in
which
it
annunciated
once
again
in
the
slocum
case
in
1950.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
moore
said
there
was
not
--
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
even
attempting
to
take
it
away
from
the
courts
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--
the
power
from
the
courts.
and
now
the
contention
is
that
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction
because
of
what
the
railway
labor
act
says.
now,
it's
also
contended
here
that
there
is
an
election
that
went
up
before
the
board,
that
he
elected
to
go
that
route.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
would
say
so.
and
here
they
cite
cases
which
come
under
section
9
of
the
interstate
commerce
course
--
act
which
specifically
provides
that
you
have
an
election
to
either
go
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
go
into
courts
for
a
violation
under
the
act
and
it's
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
apparently
congress
felt
it
necessary
in
that
case
and
that
was
enacted
long
before
the
1934
amendments
came
into
being
but
--
and
i
certainly,
in
mr.
justice
black's
language
in
that
united
states
versus
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
i
think
it
--
this
court
there
indicated
that
the
administrative
finality
of
a
decision
by
the
board
was
out
of
harmony
with
the
general
legislative
pattern.
i
--
i
don't
see
anything
in
here
really
indicating
any
intent
to
take
away
the
right
from
this
man
particularly
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
--
that
is
correct.
the
case
is
talking
about
reviewability
but
the
contention
was
raised
there
that
they
couldn't
even
review
that
this
particular
holding
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
final
and
that
there
could
be
no
court
review.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
right.
i
might
say
that
there
have
been
several
occasions
where
reference
has
made
with
--
as
to
what
the
legislative
intent
was.
and
with
respect
to
the
1934
amendments
of
the
railway
labor
act,
in
the
slocum
case
here
in
1950,
mr.
justice
reed,
in
that
case
there,
this
court
said
that
the
moore
holding,
namely,
that
you
can
go
into
a
--
litigate
in
a
court
the
wrongful
discharge
case
that
that
did
not
apply
if
it
was
a
matter
within
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
a
matter
involving
interpretation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
to
i
believe
who
was
entitled
to
a
particular
work.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
think
not.
i
think
it's
a
case
that
--
which
should
not
necessarily
be
answered
by
the
board.
i
don't
think
their
expertise
in
railroad
affairs
is
something
that
--
that
only
they
could
answer
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
argued
factually
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
eating
and
sleeping
accommodations
available
at
this
given
place.
and
i
think
that
in
effect
is
a
hard
question.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
actually,
no.
well,
the
way
i
see
the
common-law
action
is
and
as
expressed
by
the
court
below
whether
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
railroad
has
the
right
to
discharge
price
for
returning
from
nipton
to
las
vegas
to
eat
in
the
light
of
the
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
i
--
i
can't.
there
may
be
some
questions
as
to
what
eating
and
sleeping
facilities
could
be
but
aside
from
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
basically
a
simple
question
not
requiring
railroad
labor
people
or
people
with
experience
to
determine
it.
i
think
any
late
jury
should
be
able
to
determine
whether
or
not
eating
and
sleeping
facilities
were
available
there
at
that
time.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
so.
but
we
say
that
they
never
answer
that
question.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes.
and
i
--
and
i
would
say
they
went
no
further
and
said,
“claim
denied.”
i
might
not
be
in
a
position
now
to
urge
that
the
merits
were
not
considered
by
that
board
and
determined.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
--
the
law
says
that
they
shall
make
an
award
shall
have
finding
--
and
may
make
findings.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
in
that
case,
before
the
board,
the
claim
could
only
be,
i
believe,
for
lost
wages
and
also
reinstatement.
now
--
now
the
claim
could
only
be
for
damages,
for
breach
of
contract
which
might
encompass
numerous
things
like
lost
wages,
one
of
those
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
in
the
complaint?
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
charge
that
it
was
in
affecting
violation
of
the
agreement
i
believe.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
probably
no
difference
in
that
point
assuming
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
in
evidentiary
standpoint,
i
would
say
nothing.i
would
say
the
same
evidence
would
probably
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--
admit
except
that
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
in
the
case
where
i'm
trying
to
enforce
the
award?
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
in
that
case,
i
of
course
would
allege
the
prior
procedure
before
the
board,
its
findings
and
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it
would
have
to
be
alleged,
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
all
--
all
i
know
is
that
the
section
3
of
these
three
first
says
that
you
shall
bring
an
action
and
that
the
finding
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
and
that
there
shall
be
a
suit
de
novo.
at
least
that's
what
the
washington
terminal
case
said
which
was
affirmed
here.it
said
that
it
shall
be
a
suit
de
novo.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
--
this
is
the
first
railroad
discharge
case
that
i've
ever
had.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
would
assume
if
it's
an
enforcement
suit
that
you're
probably
limited
by
what
the
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
don't
believe
so,
but
as
i
pointed
out
a
few
moment
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it
said
the
suit
shall
proceed
in
all
respects
as
other
suits
except
that
on
a
trial
of
such
suit,
the
findings
in
order.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
that
--
that
would
be
say
a
common-law
action
for
wrongful
discharge.
i
think
the
only
difference
here
is
you
have
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
none
that
i
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
--
none
that
i
see.
none
that
i
see.
in
other
words,
as
far
as
the
railroad
is
concerned,
it
in
effect
has
two
cracks
if
its
contention
is
correct,
if
price
would
lose
--
if
an
employee
would
lose
before
the
board,
they
would
have
the
right
to
not
do
anything
and
just
sit
back
and
wait
for
enforcement
suit,
at
that
time,
they
will
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
not
that
i'm
aware
of
it.
the
procedure
of
course
would
have
to
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
i
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well
the
i.c.c.
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
i.c.c.
specifically
says
he
cannot
commit
and
file
a
suit.
there
is
nothing
in
here
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
intent
which
would
fairly
indicate
that
it
was
intended
to
preclude
them
and
i
think
in
the
moore
case,
we
say
there
is
--
this
court
said
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
to
preclude
them.
