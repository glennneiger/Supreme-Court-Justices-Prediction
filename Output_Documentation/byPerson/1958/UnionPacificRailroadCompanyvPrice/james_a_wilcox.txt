mr.
james
a.
wilcox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
is
whether
in
the
absence
of
any
due
process
or
other
constitutional
question,
a
district
court
has
the
jurisdiction
to
review
and
pass
upon
the
grounds
relied
upon
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
in
denying
respondent's
claim
of
wrongful
discharge,
looked
at
from
another
view
is
the
denial
award
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
final
and
binding
as
congress
said
it
would
be
in
the
railway
labor
act.
also
involved
here
is
the
question
of
whether
respondent's
election
to
proceed
administrate
--
under
the
administrative
remedy
of
the
act,
bars
his
subsequent
action
for
damages
in
the
course.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
they
are
these:
respondent
price
was
employed
by
the
petitioner
union
pacific
as
a
brakeman
at
las
vegas,
nevada.
back
in
1949,
in
july,
he
was
called
to
work
in
about
nine
in
the
evening
and
he
was
told
to
“dead-head”
to
a
small
point
in
california,
nipton,
56
miles
away.
upon
arriving
at
nipton,
he
called
his
superior
officer,
the
train
dispatcher,
and
he
was
instructed
to
stay
at
nipton
for
a
few
hours
and
then
to
work
as
a
swing
brakeman
on
a
train
coming
back
in
to
las
vegas.
mr.
price,
the
respondent
objected
to
those
instructions.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
a
swing
brakeman,
sir,
is
a
brakeman
that
is
required
we
say
in
the
railroad
industry
unnecessarily
but
it's
required
under
the
state
law,
the
--
the
extra
brakeman.
it
is
required
under
nevada
law.
mr.
price
objected
this
instruction
of
staying
there,
this
three
to
four
hours
and
he
asserted
that
it
was
in
violation
of
a
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
union
pacific
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
who
represented
for
purposes
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
man
employed
as
brakeman
on
our
property.
he
was
again
told
to
stay
at
that
point
but
price
took
the
matters
into
his
own
hands
and
proceeded
back
to
las
vegas.
as
a
consequence,
he
was
charged
with
being
insubordinate
and
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
agreement,
a
hiring
or
investigation
was
scheduled
to
be
held.
price
was
directed
to
appear
at
this
hearing.
now,
this
hearing
was
twice
postponed
and
when
it
was
finally
held,
mr.
price
did
not
show
up.
the
hearing
was,
however,
held
in
his
absence,
evidence
taken
and
put
in
and
taken
down
in
short
hand
and
a
transcript
prepared
of
that
insubordinate
action.
following
that,
price
was
discharged.
this
was
in
july
of
1949.
subsequently,
price
has
requested
the
brotherhood
to
handle
his
grievance
over
his
alleged
wrongful
discharge
with
the
carrier
and
sought
there
in
his
reinstatement
would
pay
for
all
time
loss.
that
dispute
was
not
settled
on
the
property
but
was
ultimately
referred
at
mr.
price's
election
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
3
first
(i)
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
claim
at
the
board
was
a
claim
for
reinstatement
with
back
pay,
premised
upon
an
alleged
wrongful
discharge.
the
claim
was
handled
in
a
usual
manner
at
the
board.
at
that
--
before
that
tribunal,
only
mr.
price
urged
two
basic
contentions.
first,
he
said
that
his
disobedience,
his
failure
to
follow
instructions
was
not
insubordination.
it
was
justified
because
we
had
no
right
to
make
--
to
command
him
to
stay
there.
the
other
point
that
he
had
was
that
we
violated
the
labor
contract
in
holding
the
hearing
in
his
absence.
the
board
deadlocked
on
that
case.
ultimately,
under
the
provisions
of
3
first
(l),
a
referee
was
called
in,
a
neutral
person
whom
congress
has
said,
shall
sit
with
the
division
and
make
an
award.
on
june
25,
1952,
the
board
issued
its
award
or
decision,
as
it's
known.
and
that
award
was
simply
'claim
denied.'
the
board
also
made
some
findings.
and
in
those
findings,
the
board
did
discuss
the
question
of
mr.
price's
failure
to
follow
his
instructions.
and
the
board
stated
and
i'm
quoting,
“price,
was
found
to
have
wilfully
disobeyed
his
orders.”
and
the
board
then
said,
“this
was
insubordination
and
merited
discipline.”
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
finding,
sir,
is
on
page
57
of
the
record.
it
is
the
first
paragraph
there.
there
is
a
preceding
sentence
where
the
board
said,
“if
the
carrier
is
to
have
efficient
operations
on
its
railroad,
its
employees
must
be
relied
upon
to
obey
instructions.”
the
board
then
proceeded
in
the
balance
of
its
findings
to
hold
that
the
carrier
did
not
violate
the
agreement
in
holding
the
hearing
in
mr.
price's
absence.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir,
they
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
they
do.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
sir,
as
far
the
questions
presented
by
union
pacific,
the
petitioner
here,
not
at
all.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
we
don't
rely
to
it.
as
a
matter
of
full
disclosure,
we
put
it
in
our
brief.
it
is
not
record
matter.
the
request
or
the
petition
for
an
interpretation
was
made
prior
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
being
filed
here.
it
was
rendered
a
week
after
you
granted
certiorari
but
we
do
not
rely
upon
it.
we
think
the
language
itself
is
clear
and
we
did
in
the
court
below.
now,
there
are
other
points
raised
by
mr.
price
at
the
board.
and
the
board
made
no
pretends
of
ruling
upon
those
points
at
all.
he
made
a
number
of
arguments.
but
those
were
the
two
main
points.
following
the
issuance
of
that
award,
mr.
price,
the
petitioner,
took
no
--
made
no
effort
to
challenge
that
board
award
on
any
constitutional
or
procedural
or
statutory
basis.
instead,
three
years
later,
and
i
regret
to
announce
that
there
is
an
error
at
page
6
of
our
brief
where
we
said,
'one
year
later'
when
in
fact
it
is
'three
years
later.'
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
at
page
6,
sir.
we
said
---
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
page
there.
almost
a
year
later
and
that
should
be
almost
three
years
later
right
in
the
middle
of
page
6.
he
filed
this
action
which
was
a
diversity
action
in
the
district
court
in
nevada.
he
sought
damages
for
wrongful
discharge.
the
carrier,
the
petitioner
filed
an
answer
setting
forth
the
award
of
the
board
and
asserting
that
it
was
final
and
binding
under
section
3
first
(m)
of
the
act
which
provides
that
awards
shall
be
final
and
binding
on
both
parties
except
insofar
as
they
shall
contain
a
money
award.
i
might
state
that
there's
no
question
here
that
this
was
not
a
money
award.
it
is
pretty
well
settled
that
a
denial
of
a
claim
for
money
is
not
a
money
award.
and
we
also
assert
--
alleged
that
the
claim
was
barred
under
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedy.
our
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
was
granted
and
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
--
that
court
reversed
in
a
two
to
one
decision,
judge
healy
dissenting.
however,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
think
judge
healy
was
also
wrong
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
which
i'll
explain
a
little
later.
the
court's
opinion
is
a
little
difficult
to
rationalize.
the
bo
--
that
court
recognize
that
the
board
had
made
an
award
in
this
matter.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
itself
said,
“the
adjustment
board
denied
price's
claim
in
its
entirety."
now,
the
claim
was
for
reinstatement
and
back
pay
and
it
was
based
upon
wrongful
discharge.
it
was
that
claim
that
the
court
below
said,
“was
denied
in
its
entirety.”
it
also
recognized
that
this
was
simply
a
collateral
attack
on
the
board
award.
it
also
recognized
the
finality
language
which
i've
just
read
to
you.
but
it
avoided
the
effect
of
that
finality
language
by
adopting
a
very
unusual
argument
advanced
by
respondent
that
the
board
had
failed
to
pass
upon
the
merits
of
price's
dispute
with
the
railroad.
in
order
to
adopt
that
argument,
the
court
below,
first
of
all,
had
to
amend
the
railway
labor
act
and
they
did
it
in
this
fashion.
they
said
that
an
award
of
the
board
is
final
and
binding
if
it
represents
an
adjudication
on
the
merit.
then
having
open
the
door
or
carved
out
an
area
that
they
could
review
the
board's
award,
they
walked
through
it
and
said,
“let's
decide
what
were
the
merits.”
they
not
only
reviewed
the
board's
findings,
they
went
to
the
submissions
that
were
filed
to
the
board.
they
found
that
two
questions
were
presented
as
i've
outlined.
was
price's
disobedience
justified
and
was
the
holding
of
the
hearing
in
his
absence
a
violation
of
the
agreement?
they
concluded
that
the
question
as
to
price's
disobedience
being
justified
was
the
merit
of
the
case.
and
they
said
that
the
board
has
misunderstood
the
case.
the
board
has
misconstrued
price's
submission.
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
try
to
find
out
what
the
board
believed.
and
that
word,
“believe”
is
in
their
opinion.
they
held
that
since
the
board
did
not
pass
upon
what
they
determine
to
be
the
merit,
that
the
award
was
not
final
and
binding.
now,
it
is
significant
to
know
that
the
court
below
is
very,
very
candid.
they
said
that
this
question
was
simply
a
dispute
over
the
grounds
relied
upon
by
the
board
in
reaching
its
denial
award
which
all
parties
could
see
to
have
been
unambiguous.
now,
i
just
submit
that
in
its
quest
for
the
merit,
its
unnecessarily
search
for
the
merit,
the
court
below
confused
arguments
advanced
by
the
respondent,
price,
in
support
of
his
claim
with
the
ultimate
question
which
he
presented
to
the
board.
and
the
ultimate
question
was,
“could
price
be
reinstated
with
pay?”
and
the
board
said,
“no.”
now,
anyone
of
the
arguments
that
were
advanced
by
price,
have
they
been
accepted
by
the
board?
an
award
sustaining
his
claim
for
back
pay
and
reinstatement
would
have
been
an
issue.
justice
brennan
has
brought
up
this
question
of
the
interpretation
subsequent
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
the
petitioner
did
file
a
petition
with
the
adjustment
board
pursuant
to
3
first
(m)
which
provide
that
in
case
a
dispute
arises
involving
an
interpretation
of
the
award,
the
division
of
the
board
upon
request
of
either
party,
shall
interpret
the
award
in
the
light
of
the
dispute.
now,
we
asserted
in
the
court
below
that
if
respondent,
price
was
serious
in
his
contention
that
the
board
had
failed
to
consider
the
merits
of
his
discharge,
then
all
he
had
to
do
was
refer
the
matter
back
to
the
board.
the
court
below
rejected
that
contention.
in
the
interpretation
which
the
board
issued
following
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari,
and
that
interpretation
incidentally
was
rendered
by
the
board
in
this
--
as
composed
exactly
at
the
time
the
award
was
made
namely,
the
referee,
a.
langley
(inaudible),
was
a
member
of
that
board
and
sat
as
11-man
board
in
interpreting
its
award.
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
board
stated
that
its
award
--
that
the
sentence
in
its
award,
“this
was
insubordination
and
merited
discipline,”
demonstrated
that
the
board
had
considered
and
rejected
the
argument
that
price's
refusal
to
follow
orders
was
justified.
the
board
went
ahead
and
said
that
that
award
constituted
a
final
disposition
of
that
dispute.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir,
i
have
to
back
up
a
little
bit
and
get
on
and
off
the
record
but
i
will
explain
it.
the
court
below
relied
upon
a
case
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
where
there
was
an
award
that
was
not
clear
and
it
was
a
district
court.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said,
“i'm
not
sure
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
award.
it's
incumbent
upon
the
parties
to
get
an
interpretation.”
now
that
case
was
cited
as
one
of
the
authorities
by
the
court
below
and
by
respondent
--
by
the
respondent.
but
that
court
said,
“we
should
get
an
interpretation.”
then
the
other
reason
that
actually
militated
for
this,
is
at
the
time
mr.
price
refused
to
follow
the
instructions,
we
were
in
rather
serious
labor
difficulties
with
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
over
the
question
of
our
--
keeping
this
men
at
nipton.
and
they
are
asserting
that
it
was
in
violation
of
the
local
contract.
in
fact,
the
national
mediation
board
had
taken
a
hold
of
the
matter
and
they
come
into
the
case
only
when
it
represents
a
rather
serious
problem
that
being
a
major
dispute
as
distinguished
from
a
minor.
it
was
in
that
atmosphere
that
mr.
price
decided
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hand.
and
i
will
say
that
things
were
just
a
little
warm
for
a
little
while
over
this
entire
matter.
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
board
and
our
management
was
crazy
after
receiving
the
court
of
appeals
decision
with
an
order
of
the
court
which
set
that
award
aside.
now,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
get
the
board's
own
interpretation
of
its
award
to
exhaust
everything
that
we
should
do
and
we
did
just
that.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir,
it
is
not
printed
in
the
record.
i
have
it
here
--
it
was
printed
in
the
carrier
submission
to
the
board
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
i
can
furnish
it
to
you
if
you'd
like.
it's
rather
long.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
wait
a
minute.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
--
it
is
in
the
record.
i
thought
you're
referring
to
another
--
it
is
in
the
record
at
page
7
and
8
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
it's
rule
33.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
we
believe
the
decision
below
is
so
plainly
wrong,
that
only
a
brief
comment
is
necessary
to
demonstrate.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
sir
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
there
are
two
authorities.
the
case
of
hargis
versus
the
wabash,
we've
cited
in
a
footnote
at
page
12
of
our
brief,
hargis
versus
the
wabash
and
then
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
burley
on
a
point
which
the
court
took
no
exception
to.
and
i
may
say
that
--
i've
never
heard
of
any
other
attempts
to
make
a
denial
of
a
claim
for
money
--
of
money
award
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
those
are
the
only
two
authorities
on
the
point.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
if
it
is
not
a
money
award,
mr.
justice
black
then,
under
the
language
of
congress,
the
award
is
final
and
binding
on
the
parties.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
partially,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
interstate
commerce?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir,
i
am.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
none,
whatsoever
sir.
you
found
--
and
i
was
impressed
with
your
distinction,
you
found
that
--
in
that
case,
the
united
states
as
the
shipper
did
not
have
an
election
to
go
to
the
commission
because
as
i
recall
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates
were
involved.
and
so,
the
rule
of
section
9
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
possibly
(inaudible)
was
probably
inapplicable.
i
think
you
made
some
other
distinctions
thereto,
because
that's
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
right
away.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
unquestionably
he
had
an
election
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
it
does
not.
it
just
says
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
he
may
refer
the
matters
to
the
board.
yes,
sir
in
that
sense.
and
following
the
moore
decision
in
what
this
court
said
in
(inaudible),
everybody
has
thought
they
had
an
election.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
that
is
right.
we
--
we
consider
--
we
base
this
on
two
grounds,
the
doctrine
of
election
and
the
finality
language
of
the
act.
and
having
elected
to
go
to
the
board,
we
think
the
finality
language
is
even
more
binding.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
no
such
question
in
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
below
did
--
collateral
review
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no
such
contention
was
made,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
has
there
been
a
money
award,
sir,
the
law
provides
that
we
should,
upon
refusal
to
pay
such
a
money
award,
the
matter
could
be
enforced
in
a
federal
district
court,
as
a
practical
matter
it's
seldom
that
the
--
that
the
awards
are
enforced
in
that
fashion.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no.
no,
sir.
in
case
the
award
goes
against
the
railroad
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
the
railroad
cannot
take
it
to
court,
until
the
employee
elects
to
file
an
enforcement
action
against
the
railroad
for
refusing
to
comply.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
--
(voice
overlap)
very
effective
ways,
mr.
justice
black
without
going
to
the
court.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no
--
that's
true.
the
law
does
and
the
congress
contemplated
that
if
there
is
a
money
award
that
the
matter
could
be
on
the
carrier's
refusal
to
further
litigate
it
in
the
courts
but
only
if
the
employee
is
sued.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
and
that's
the
reason,
i
was
interested
in
your
distinguishing
the
brady
case,
because
in
brady
case
the
--
this
court
held
that
the
right
of
an
election,
given
to
a
claimant,
may
well
have
been
deemed
by
congress
an
adequate
ground
for
making
the
commission's
award
final
as
to
him.
that's
the
reason
i
got
in
to
your
united
states
versus
i.c.c.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
heard
the
argument
on
that
sir.
i'd
like
to
very,
very
briefly
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
except
that
it's
been
raised
in
briefs
that
has
been
filed
by
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that
is
right.
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
run
through
the
three
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
oh,
yes
sir.
i
forgot
to
mention
that.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
i
might
--
i
should
back
up
on
that
too,
that
it's
interesting
to
know
and
the
records
support
this,
if
you
will
review
the
handling
on
the
property
by
brotherhood
on
mr.
price's
behalf,
not
one's
in
a
number
of
letters
did
they
ever
even
take
any
exception
to
the
man
having
been
insubordinate.
their
only
complaint
was
that
we
went
ahead
and
held
that
hearing
without
his
being
present
after
having
twice
postponed
it.
and
then
when
they
got
to
the
board,
they
did
raise
that
other
issue
that
he
was
justified
in
being
disobedient.
but
mr.
langley
(inaudible),
the
referee,
his
paragraph
was
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
at
the
top
of
page
57.
he
started
out
with
the
purpose
if
the
carrier
is
going
to
have
efficient
operations,
they've
got
to
rely
upon
employees
to
obey
instructions.
and
then
he
says,
claimant
was
found
to
a
willfully
disobeyed
order
and
this
was
insubordination
and
narrative
discipline
and
then
he
proceed
to
discuss
the
other
point.
only
recently,
this
court,
two
years
ago
in
the
chicago
river
case
adverted
to
the
final
and
binding
clause
as
being
unequivocal
and
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
stated
that
it
should
be
literally
applied
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
showing
of
a
contrary
or
qualified
intention
of
congress.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
rejected
the
attempt
of
the
brotherhood
to
follow
an
alternative
which
they
thought
was
more
desirable.
this
court
said
that
such
an
interpretation
of
the
act
would
render
the
finality
language
meaningless.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
require
nor
even
permit
explicitly
that
findings
shall
be
made
in
any
award.
findings
are
not
even
mentioned.
the
intention
of
congress
is
that
these
disputes
shall
be
referred
to
a
board
and
they
shall
be
decided
by
the
board
by
the
making
of
an
award.
now,
in
an
enforcement
action,
if
such
an
action
is
brought
and
if
there
are
finding,
they
will
then
be
prima
facie
as
well
as
the
award
of
what
the
expense.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
i
have
to
answer
your
question
this
way,
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
way
--
the
--
the
board
does
not
award
specific
money
damages
if
they
claim
for
reinstatement
with
back
pay.
if
it
is
sustained,
we
go
back
and
check
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
mr.
price's
case,
we
would
probably
take
the
next
junior
man
take
his
earnings
and
those
will
be
the
earnings
that
mr.
price
would
be
given.
the
award
of
the
board
is
nearly
on
sustaining
or
a
denial
award
and
these
discharge
cases
are
always
framed
on
the
basis
of
claim
for
reinstatement
with
that
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
the
judgment
is
within
an
enforcement
proceeding,
the
--
the
ultimate
amount
of
money
would
be
the
amount
that
is
shown
from
the
records
of
the
carrier,
i
assume
that
would
be
lost.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
we
very
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
--
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
those
are
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
under
an
interpretation
pursuant
to
3
first
(m).
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
oh,
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
would
think
not.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir,
an
award
of
full
pay
for
time
loss
would
be,
i
would
imagine,
anything
that
any
court
would
give
him.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
in
an
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
and
the
damage
is
obtainable.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
sir?
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes,
except
that
--
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
yes.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
and
any
other
lawsuit,
sir,
as
i
understand
it,
the
damages
for
a
wrongful
discharge
are
damages
up
to
the
date
of
trial
less
what
it
shows
in
litigation
or
should
show
in
litigation.
it's
possible
that
the
award
from
the
adjustment
board
would
be
even
greater.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
i
did
have
one
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
mention
having
listened
to
the
day
case
the
other
day.
i
wanted
to
mention
that
in
an
accelerated
discharge
--
in
a
discharge
case,
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
accelerates
the
discharge
cases
so
the
time
like
here
was
only
one
year
rather
than
three
which
you
normally
find.
mr.
james
a.
wilcox
well,
mr.
(inaudible)
was
closer.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
--
it's
less
than
three
years,
sir.
sometimes
it's
less
than
almost
two
years
or
a
year.
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
the
hearing
before
the
national
adjustment
board
was
waived
by
the
organization.
thank
you,
sir.
