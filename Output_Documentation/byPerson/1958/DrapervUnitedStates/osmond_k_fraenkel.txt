mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
narcotics
conviction
here
on
the
question
with
respect
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
seized
at
the
time
of
an
arrest
without
warrant.
the
case
depends
therefore
upon
the
issue
whether
or
not
the
arresting
agent
had
probably
case
to
make
the
arrest.
the
arrest
was
made
in
the
railroad
station
in
denver.
a
few
days
after
the
arresting
agent
had
received
information
from
an
informer,
whose
identity
was
disclosed
at
the
trial,
the
informer
in
the
mean
time
having
conveniently
died
so
that
his
identity
was
easily
disclosed.
the
informer
had
done
this.
he
had
telephoned
the
agent
saying
draper
is
a
peddler.
nothing
happened
after
that.
no
attempt
was
made
to
shuttle
draper.
few
days
later
the
informer
calls
up
again
and
he
says,
"draper
has
gone
to
chicago
and
will
come
back
in
a
day
or
two
with
narcotics."
a
description
of
draper
was
given
to
the
agent.
nothing
was
done
then
in
any
attempt
to
check
on
draper's
movements
in
chicago.
but
the
agents,
a
whole
group
of
them
went
to
the
railroad
station
on
each
of
the
succeeding
days
and
watched
trains
as
they
came
in
from
chicago.
and
on
the
second
of
the
two
days,
they
saw
a
man
who
answered
the
description
which
had
been
given.
they
approached
him
--
or
one
of
the
agents
approached
him,
asking
his
name,
the
agent
testified
that
he
gave
a
certain
name
which
later
turned
out
not
to
be
his,
they
then
placed
him
under
arrest,
searched
him
and
found
the
heroin.
a
motion
was
timely
made
to
suppress.
the
evidence
so
seized
was
denied.
the
conviction
affirmed,
with
a
strong
dissent
this
court
granted
certiorari.
now
we
contended
that
this
was
an
improper
arrest.
that
the
agent
acted
on
hearsay
that
the
hearsay
was
conclusory
and
more
over
that
there
was
not
even
information
given
to
the
agent
that
a
crime
had
in
fact
been
committed
but
merely
information
that
it
was
expected
that
a
crime
was
going
to
be
committed.
the
court
below
recognized
that
the
information
given
by
the
informer
would
not
have
justified
the
arrest,
the
agent
at
the
trial
on
the
appearance
to
suppress
did
not
testify
whether
he
had
enquired
of
the
informer,
what
basis
the
informer
had
for
the
statements
made.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
he
was
not
asked
by
anyone.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
by
either
side.
the
government
makes
some
suggestion
in
its
brief
here
that
the
defendant
should
have
asked
the
question
but
we
submit
that
that
is
wholly
an
--
out
of
the
question.
the
government
was
in
possession
of
the
facts.
if
any
inquiry
had
been
made
by
the
agent
of
the
informer
it
was
the
government's
duty
to
bring
out
the
facts.
i
don't
think
the
defendant
was
under
any
obligation
whatever
to
cross-examine
on
the
subject.
the
government's
case
was
simply
inadequate
in
its
own
presentation
of
its
evidence.
there
was
no
reason
why
the
defendant
should
anyway
seek
--
supplement
the
government's
case.
now,
the
suggestion
is
made
however
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
government
that
the
information
obtained
was
corroborated.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
say
no.
it
may
well
be
that
if
they
had
done
that
at
the
time
and
the
informer
had
also
gone
before
the
magistrate,
the
informer
might
have
been
able
to
supplement
the
conclusory
information
which
he
had
given
and
therefore
a
warrant
might
have
issued.
but
i
submit
that
on
the
mere
statement
which
the
agent
could
have
made,
there
would
be
no
probably
cause.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
because
it
was
--
not
merely
because
it
was
hearsay.
i
am
reluctant
to
insist
that
under
no
circumstances
could
hearsay
justify
an
arrest
because
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances.
and
this
court
has
permitted
in
the
case
of
moving
automobiles.
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
as
in
hot
pursuit
for
instance
where
a
bystander
--
commission
of
a
crime
follows
the
escaping
perpetrator
of
the
crime
and
then
tells
an
officer,
"this
man
shot
somebody.
arrest
him."
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
it
would
not
be
all
right
in
my
opinion
in
this
particular
case
because
the
charge
--
the
arrest
here
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
returning
from
chicago
with
narcotics
in
his
possession
at
that
time.
now
--
and
a
warrant
might
have
been
obtained
on
the
basis
of
the
informer's
knowledge
that
an
offense
had
been
committed
in
the
past
which
might
justify
prosecution,
yes.
but
here,
that
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
arrest.
and
the
inference
which
the
government
asks
this
court
to
draw
was
that
from
the
mere
circumstance
that
the
informer
had
given
a
description
which
fitted
a
particular
individual
and
that
individual
came
from
a
train
which
had
started
in
chicago.
and
i
think
i
have
been
somewhat
swept
away
by
some
of
the
government's
arguments
because
i
noticed
in
rereading
my
reply
brief
that
i
sort
of
assumed
that
this
defendant
had
been
in
chicago.but
of
course
there
is
nothing
to
justify
that
inference.
the
mere
fact
that
a
train
comes
from
a
place
doesn't
indicate
the
person
on
the
train
came
from
the
point
of
origin
of
the
train.
but
their
argument
is
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
on
a
train
from
chicago
and
answered
the
description
justified
the
inference
that
while
in
chicago
he
had
violated
the
law.and
i
say
that
cannot
be
done.
now,
many
cases
have
been
cited
by
both
sides
in
lower
courts,
which
are
all
over
the
place.
they
can't
be
reconciled
basically.
some
of
them
can
be
distinguished
on
the
basis
of
particular
facts
in
the
case.
but
i
think
it
will
be
found
that
the
better
reason
of
all
the
cases
go
on
the
basis
that
the
second
circuit
merely
in
the
case
last
cited
in
the
government
--
by
the
government,
at
the
end
of
its
own
brief,
namely
from
where
there
is
information
obtained,
the
agents
have
a
duty
to
do
something
and
in
that
particular
case
after
receiving
information
of
pretty
much
the
same
kind
this
was
received
here,
the
agents
didn't
jump
in
and
make
an
immediate
arrest.
they
followed
the
man.
they
shadowed
him
to
such
a
point
that
the
man
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
being
shadowed.
and
on
a
particular
occasion
when
the
shadowing
continued,
made
that
awareness
evident,
in
other
words
showed
a
consciousness
of
guilt
as
in
for
instance
in
the
husty
case
decided
by
this
court
also
cited
by
the
government.
the
element
of
consciousness
of
guilt
was
involved
because
there,
when
the
agents
approached
a
car,
the
people
in
it
started
to
run
away.
now,
in
such
situations
where
the
arresting
agents
do
something
to
justify
an
inference
that
a
crime
is
being
committed
the
arrest
maybe
a
valid
one.
but
i
say
that
here,
where
the
agents
did
nothing,
you
cannot
draw
any
comfort
from
the
circumstances
that
the
individual
answered
the
description,
because
obviously
you
never
would
have
an
arrest
of
a
person
unknown
to
agents
unless
somebody
was
able
to
give
a
description,
and
say
at
what
place
he
was
likely
to
be.
and
if
from
that
mere
mechanical
fact
which
has
no
relation
to
the
commission
of
crime,
whatever,
it
is
proper
to
draw
an
inference
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
merely
because
somebody
tells
an
agent
that
a
crime
is
going
to
be
committed,
then
i
suggest
our
liberties
are
pretty
far
gone.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case,
without
going
into
the
basic
question
of
hearsay,
can
rest
on
the
proposition,
that
where
information
is
obtained,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
officer
to
whom
the
information
is
given
in
the
first
place
to
ascertain
the
basis
on
which
the
informant
gives
that
information,
has
that
information,
and
to
testify
either
before
a
magistrate
when
seeking
a
warrant
or
before
a
court
when
the
validity
of
the
arrest
is
in
question,
to
testify
with
regard
to
those
circumstances.
so,
that
the
magistrate
or
the
court
can
determine
whether
that
testimony
is
sufficient,
those
details
are
sufficient,
to
justify
an
inference
in
a
commission
of
crime.
and
in
that
respect
it
seems
to
me
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
giordenello
case
decided
by
this
court
in
the
last
term,
where
information
was
held
insufficient,
because
conclusory
only.
so
i
say
here
the
probable
cause
is
insufficient,
because
based
only
on
conclusions,
and
this
case
i
submit
is
even
stronger
than
the
other
one,
because
in
at
least
in
giordenello,
the
statement
of
the
complaint
was
positive
that
a
crime
had
been
committed.
whereas
here
this
record
can
be
searched
in
vain
for
any
information
given
to
the
arresting
officer,
that
a
crime
had
been
committed,
all
that
is
claimed
is
that
the
informer
said
he
is
going
to
chicago
to
buy
heroin,
and
that
was
several
days
before
he
returned.
the
agents
might
have
made
up
to
check,
they
made
no
efforts.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
evidence
was
--
the
arrest
was
illegal,
that
the
arrest
is
illegal,
the
evidence
was
improperly
received.
obviously
without
that
evidence,
the
procession
of
the
heroin,
the
conviction
could
not
stand.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right,
but
i
would
say
this.
it
maybe
one
thing
to
permit
an
arrest
warrant
on
hearsay.
it's
quite
a
different
matter
to
justify
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
on
hearsay.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
realistically
yes.
and
i
think
that
what
was
said
by
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
johnson
case
which
i
quote,
which
dealt
with
search
warrants
rather
than
arrest
warrants,
bears
on
the
issue,
because
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
require
officers
of
the
law
who
mr.
justice
jackson
quite
appropriately
described
as
often
being
engaged
in
the
competitive
business
of
ferreting
out
crime.
to
have
regard
for
the
rights
of
citizen,
and
therefore
not
to
act
on
their
own
judgment,
but
to
submit
facts
to
the
magistrate
for
his
determination.
now,
we
--
i
recognize
as
i
said
before,
that
this
court
has
carved
out
exceptions
as
in
the
case
of
moving
vehicles,
and
i
should
suppose
that
they
might
carve
out
a
similar
exception
in
the
case
of
hot
pursuit,
to
justify
an
arrest
on
hearsay,
simply
because
under
such
circumstances,
no
opportunity
exists
to
do
anything
else.
while
the
government
tries
that
analogize
this,
because
of
the
ease
with
which
narcotics
can
been
disposed
of,
i
think
that's
an
oversimplification.
obviously
a
person
who
is
--
as
is
suggested
here
by
the
informer,
engaged
in
the
business
of
peddling
doesn't
do
it
just
once.
and
good
police
work
might
have
enabled
the
government
by
watching
him
to
have
caught
him
as
was
done
in
many
of
the
other
cases.
after
all,
the
(inaudible)
conviction
was
reversed
because
good
police
work
didn't
operate.
the
fbi
jumped
in
too
fast
and
arrested
too
soon,
and
here
too,
they
jumped
in
too
fast,
although
it
wasn't
the
fbi.
yes
sir.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
would
say
that
would
be
insufficient
because
a
man
can
go
to
chicago
even
with
an
evil
intent.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
--
i
would
prefer
that
to
be
the
rule,
it's
not
necessary
in
this
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
think
that
should
be
the
rule
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
i
recognized
that
that
may
be
putting
an
unnecessary
hobble.
i
therefore
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
need
not
go
into
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
can
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
said
that's
--
that
is
in
itself
is
a
wholly
innocent
picture.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
many
men
go
to
chicago
and
come
back,
more
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
if
they
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
enough
to
justify
the
arrest
of
a
person
merely
because
he
was
seen
going
even
into
a
place
known
to
be
a
purveyor
of
narcotics
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
for
the
first
time.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
now
i
will
--
i
will
say,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
it
maybe
that
it
is
enough,
although
i
hope
this
court
does
not
so
decide,
that
they
have
information.
for
instance,
let
me
--
this
much
i
would
concede.
if
a
government
agent,
a
narcotics
agent
in
chicago,
had
been
present
at
the
time
a
purchase
was
made,
and
had
informed
the
government
agent
in
denver,
that
might
be
considered
sufficient
on
the
theory
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
which
is
a
theory
that
the
--
curiously
enough
mr.
hoover
operates
on
in
justifying
wiretapping
by
agents
of
the
fbi,
with
the
approval
i
believe
of
several
members
of
this
court
who
have
been
one
time
or
another
attorneys
general,
on
the
theory
that
the
fbi
is
in
that
respect
a
unit.
therefore,
divulgence
between
members
of
that
unit
doesn't
come
within
the
law.
they
could
be
argued
that
members
of
the
narcotics
bureau,
the
agents
are
in
that
respect
a
unit,
so
the
information
given
acknowledge
the
facts,
from
one
to
another
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
based
on
actual
observation
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
they
could
have
--
he
could
have
arrested
him
in
chicago.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
expect
of
course
the
crime
here
was
also
transportation.
perhaps
they
wanted
ordered
to
get
him
on
that,
i
don't
know.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
any
case,
i
suggest
that
here,
you
have
an
extreme
case
where
there
was
nothing
to
support
the
inference
that
a
crime
had
been
in
fact
committed,
and
that
being
so,
the
arrest
was
improper.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
haven't
--
i
can
make
three
brief
observation,
in
the
first
place
insofar
as
–-
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
i
am
sorry.
insofar
as
the
government
may
suggest
that
the
draper's
giving
of
a
fictitious
name
has
any
bearing
on
the
validity
of
the
arrest,
i
want
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officer
at
page
9
of
the
record
which
clearly
indicates
the
arrest
occurred
before
the
questioning.
so
the
fact
is
out
of
the
case.
insofar
as
it
is
suggested
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant
of
arrest,
i
submit
that
if
the
informant
who
presumably
had
some
information
which
was
reliable
and
if
he
didn't,
certainly
this
arrest
was
unjustified.
if
the
informant
on
the
basis
of
that
information
that
draper
had
committed
a
crime
in
the
past,
had
gone
before
a
magistrate,
a
warrant
could
have
issued
and
they
could
had
that
warrant
the
time
when
draper
arrived
to
chicago,
not
based
on
the
purchase
in
chicago
but
based
on
the
alleged
offenses
previously
committed.
and
finally
the
suggestion
is
that
a
warrant
couldn't
be
obtained
here
because
the
heroin
might
have
disappeared.
on
the
analogy
of
the
search
warrant
can
be
obtained
on
information
that
during
lives
in
a
home
although
by
the
time
they
get
there
it
may
be
gone.
i
don't
see
the
relevance
of
that
analogy.
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
would
be
tested
on
the
basis
of
the
information
disclosed
to
the
magistrate
who
issued
search
warrant
and
the
fact
that
circumstances
might
change
that
were
irrelevant.
so
here,
this
arrest
must
be
based
on
the
--
must
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
the
arresting
officer
disclosed
to
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
not
on
the
basis
of
what
might
have
been
disclosed
to
a
magistrate
at
sometime
by
other
people
or
even
on
the
basis
of
what
the
agent
might
have
had
in
the
back
of
his
head
which
he
didn't
disclose.
and
it
is
suggested
--
well,
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
informer
to
invent
a
story
if
this
was
malicious.
i
say
it's
an
agent's
duty
to
press
an
informant
for
detail
because
details
sometimes
disclose
their
own
weakness
or
the
malice
of
the
informant.
and
if
an
agent
is
under
a
duty
to
require
a
disclosure
by
the
informant
he
is
under
a
like
duty
to
disclose
what
he
knows
to
the
court.
in
no
other
way
can
the
question
of
probable
cause
really
be
tried
out,
because
what
the
government
is
asking
here
is
that
it's
enough
for
agent
to
get
up
in
court
and
say,
an
informant
on
whom
i
relied
told
me
that
this
man
was
–
had
done
--
violated
the
criminal
law
at
some
unspecified
time
in
the
past
and
was
going
to
violate
it
again
in
some
--
in
the
future
so
i
arrest
him.
i
say
that
is
not
proper.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
moved
it
to
press
and
we
put
our
defendant
on
--
we
did
--
(inaudible)
conclude
the
case
that
time.
the
defendant
was
put
on
the
stand,
testified
that
the
arrest
was
out
--
without
warrant.
then
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
shifts
to
the
government
to
justify
that
arrest
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
and
if
the
government
having
knowledge
of
facts
doesn't
disclose
those
facts,
it
certainly
not
the
defendant's
obligation
to
attempt
to
bring
them
out.
we
submit,
we
suspect
that
the
government
didn't
have
the
facts
disclosed,
that
the
agent
in
this
case
didn't
ask
the
informer
the
basis
of
his
knowledge
if
he
had
any,
or
his
information
had
came
from
someone
else.
but
we
can't
--
we
don't
know.
in
any
case
we
do
say
that
no
arrest
should
be
sustained
unless
the
agent
requires
the
informant
to
give
the
basis
of
his
information
and
discloses
to
the
court
what
he
has
learned.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
that
can
be
read
into
the
record,
but
it's
not
necessary
conclusion.
after
all
he
may
have
felt
--
he
may
have
wanted
to
put
--
make
it
clear
from
the
cross-examination
that
hearsay
was
alone
was
involved.
but
the
rest
was
made
clear
by
the
government
testimony.
i
don't
think
he
needed
to
go
(inaudible).
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
no,
he
had
died.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
right.
