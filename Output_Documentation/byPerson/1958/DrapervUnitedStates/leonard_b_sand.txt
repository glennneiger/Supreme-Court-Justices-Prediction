mr.
leonard
b.
sand
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
facts
of
this
case
in
somewhat
more
detail.
and
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
relationship
between
the
arresting
agent
and
the
informer.
to
indicate
that
this
was
not
a
casual
relationship,
this
was
not
the
case
of
an
anonymous
telephone
call
or
--
although
record
indicates
a
telephone
call
of
any
sort.
the
informant
in
this
case
had
for
a
period
of
six
months
furnished
information
to
agent
marsh,
which
agent
marsh,
the
arresting
officer,
had
personally
corroborated
and
in
each
instance
had
found
that
the
information
was
reliable.
and
so
here
the
source
of
the
information
is
a
source
of
proven
reliability.
on
september
3rd,
1956,
the
informer
told
agent
marsh
that
the
petitioner
was
living
at
a
certain
address
in
denver
and
was
peddling
heroine,
was
then
and
there
engaged
in
the
illicit
narcotic
traffic,
was
presently
engaged
in
narcotic
dealings.
thereafter
on
september
7th
and
i
--
i
have
reference
to
the
--
page
eight
of
the
record,
on
september
7th,
the
informant
told
the
agent,
that
on
the
day
before,
the
day
before
petitioner
had
gone
to
chicago
and
would
return
either
the
following
day,
the
8th
of
september
or
the
9th
of
september.
and
so,
while
it
maybe
very
well
to
speculate
that
the
petitioner
should
have
been
followed
to
chicago,
the
first
information
that
the
government
had
was
after
he
had
already
gone
to
chicago,
it
was
not
possible
under
this
information
to
--
to
reach
him
in
chicago.
the
informant
indicated
that
he
gone
to
chicago
by
train,
as
he
was
going
to
bring
back
approximately
three
ounces
of
heroine,
that
he
would
return
to
denver
either
on
the
morning
of
the
8th
of
september
or
the
morning
of
the
9th
of
september
also
by
train,
that
he
was
wearing
a
light
colored
raincoat
and
then
continues
with
a
very
precise
description
of
--
of
petitioner.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
information
that
was
received,
it
was
conclusory,
government
respectfully
submits
that
the
information
received
was
in
very
great
detail.
thereafter
the
law
enforcement
agents
placed
the
railroad
station
under
surveillance
and
on
the
morning
of
the
9th
of
september,
which
was
one
of
the
dates
when
the
informant
said
the
petitioner
would
return,
he
did
in
fact
return.
he
met
the
exact
physical
description
down
to
the
last
bit
of
wearing
apparel,
which
had
been
supplied
by
the
informer,
he
was
in
fact
carrying
a
tanned
zipper
bag,
as
the
informer
said
he
would,
and
he
was
arrested.
he
gave
a
name
which
was
immediately
proven
to
be
false.
he
was
clutching
in
his
pocket,
he
was
clutching
his
hands
in
his
raincoat,
his
hand
was
removed,
there
were
glossy
envelopes
in
his
hand.
this
was
an
arrest
which
took
place
in
daylight
in
a
public.
there
is
no
--
no
question
here
of
entering
into
a
private
dwelling.
there
is
no
question
here
of
the
scope
of
a
--
of
a
search.
the
reasonableness
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
have
referenced
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
nine
of
the
record
and
the
testimony
is
that
agent
marsh
told
him
that
he
was
under
arrest.
and
the
first
thing
i
asked
him,
"what's
your
name?"
and
he
said,
"karl
francis."
i
said,
"do
you
have
any
identification
on
you?"
either
he
produced
his
(inaudible)
or
i
removed
it
from
his
pocket
and
then
the
(inaudible)
i
found,
i
had
james
draper.
petitioner
says
that
it
is
relevant
here
that
the
information
that
was
received
from
the
informer
was
hearsay.
we
submit
that
whether
information
is
hearsay
or
not,
whether
it
would
be
technically
admissible
at
a
trial,
is
not
the
key
consideration.
the
rule
of
hearsay
grew
up
in
the
context
of
an
advisory
proceeding.
it
was
design
to
afford
an
ample
opportunity
for
cross-examination,
usually
before
a
jury,
so
passing
upon
on
the
ultimate
question
of
innocence
or
guilt.
it
has
no
application
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
and
a
determination
of
probable
cause,
whether
made
by
a
magistrate
or
made
by
an
arresting
officer,
is
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
there
--
the
rule
shouldn't
--
the
rule
of
hearsay
should
not
be
applied
in
the
context
of
probable
cause,
because
the
reason
for
the
rule
to
provide
cross-examination
does
not
exist.
the
question
should
be
not
is
this
hearsay,
but
is
this
reasonably
trustworthy
information.
this
court
in
the
brinegar
case,
attempted
a
definition
of
probable
cause
and
on
page
11
of
the
government's
brief
we
quote
that
definition."
probable
cause
exist,
this
court
said,
where
the
facts
and
circumstances
within
there
the
officers'
knowledge
and
of
which
they
have
reasonably
trustworthy
information,
are
sufficient
in
themselves
to
warrant
a
man
of
reasonable
caution,
in
the
belief
that
an
offence
has
been
or
is
being
committed."
personal
knowledge
or
of
which
they
have
reasonably
trustworthy
information.
and
we
suggest
that,
that
is
the
test,
not
whether
it's
hearsay
or
not,
whether
it's
reasonably
trustworthy
and
reasonable
prudent
men
in
their
everyday
lives,
on
many,
many
occasions
rely
on
what
they
believe
is
reasonably
trustworthy
hearsay.
and
of
course
this
court
held
in
the
costello
case
that
a
grand
jury
can
return
an
indictment
with
the
serious
consequences
that
that
has,
based
solely
on
hearsay.
judge
hastie
said
in
the
--
in
united
states
against
bianco,
case
which
is
similar
to
this
and
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
that
what
is
reasonable
is
a
total
judgment
and
i
think
that
that
puts
the
matter
very
well,
a
total
judgment,
all
the
circumstances
must
be
considered.
was
this
an
anonymous
tip
on
the
telephone
or
was
this
information
which
came
from
somebody
whose
reliability
you
have
reason
to
believe
in
because
you
have
checked
with
in
the
past.
was
the
information
inherently
creditable?
did
it
--
did
it
have
the
earmarks
of
being
derived
from
personal
information?
was
it
detailed?
was
it
specific?
could
it
be,
and
was
it
corroborated?
petitioners
--
the
petitioner
states
that
a
defect
here
is
of
the
source
of
the
informant's
information
was
not
disclosed
and
that
that
is
a
crucial
factor.
if
the
agent
asks
the
informant
how
do
you
know
this
and
receives
a
reply,
the
quality
of
that
is
still
no
greater,
rises
to
no
higher
dignity
than
the
credibility
of
the
informant,
if
for
some
mischievous
motive,
this
was
all
a
fabrication,
the
informant
could
as
easily
fabricate
a
--
a
source
of
the
information.
the
other
means
by
which
the
reliability
of
the
information
can
be
checked
is
externally
by
an
attempt
to
corroborate
and
that
is
what
occurred
in
this
case.
now,
of
course
the
danger
where
the
source
is
not
disclosed
is
perhaps
this
is
mere
--
mere
rumor
or
gossip.
i
think
there
are
three
things
in
this
case
which
indicate
that
the
information
supplied
by
the
informer
was
not
of
such
a
nature.
they
are
the
fact
that
in
the
past
this
information
had
always
proved
reliable.
the
very
nature
of
the
information
itself
as
set
forth
at
page
eight
and
nine
of
the
record,
that
the
precise
detail
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
time
and
the
mode
of
dress,
and
the
fact
that
that
prior
to
the
time,
the
agents
made
the
arrest,
they
corroborated
the
fact
that
draper
got
off
the
train
which
came
from
chicago
on
the
morning
of
the
9th
of
september,
attired
precisely
as
--
as
the
informant
said
he
would
be
attired
and
carrying
the
tanned
zipper
bag.
now,
it
is
true
as
petitioner
urges
and
as
the
dissenting
judge
below
pointed
out,
that
everything
which
the
agents
observed,
which
served
as
corroboration,
was
in
and
of
itself
innocent,
that
every
aspect
were
isolated
and
considered
in
and
of
itself,
it
would
be
consistent
with
innocence.
but
we
submit
that,
that
is
not
the
approach,
which
should
be
taken
and
a
question
of
probable
cause,
but
when
we
should
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
with
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
a
period
of
six
months,
that's
on
page
10
of
the
record.
he
had
been
a
special
employee
i
believe
about
six
months.
had
he
refurnished
information
to
you
before?
yes.
did
you
corroborate
that
information?
i
found
that
this
information
was
always
reliable.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
second
second
rising
case
said
that
that
alone
would
be
enough
where
the
information
came
from
an
informant
how
had
in
the
past
have
proven
reliable.
we
don't
think
it's
significant
that
the
agents
could
not
observe
by
looking
at
draper
the
fact
that
he
was
carrying
heroin,
of
course
they
could.
had
he
been
a
bootlegger
or
somebody
carrying
burglary
tools
or
something
of
that
sort
where
the
nature
of
the
crime
is
such
that
bulky
objects
are
used,
why
--
why
then
perhaps
there
would
have
been
that
corroboration
also.
the
nature
of
the
crime
--
the
fact
that
it's
narcotics
we
think
is
a
fact
which
enters
into
the
--
into
the
total
picture.and
that
where
every
other
detail
supplied
by
the
informant
proves
accurate
reasonably
prudent
man
might
suppose
that
the
ultimate
fact,
the
fact
not
observable
from
a
distance
that
he
was
carrying
heroin
would
also
prove
--
prove
accurate.
we
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that
that
the
rule
should
be
in
every
case,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
circum
--
so
that
it
might
be
that
with
respect
to
certain
circumstances
you
might
require
--
the
courts
might
require
that
there
be
some
other
indication.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
and
the
--
and
the
second
circuit
have
said
just
that.
judge
learned
hand
said
that.
i'm
--
i
am
not
certain
whether
it's
learned
hand,
it's
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
it's
the
kancso
case
we
cited
on
page
36.
standards
which
might
be
reasonable
for
the
apprehension
of
bank
robbers
might
not
be
reasonable
for
the
arrest
of
narcotics.
i
would
like
to
deal
also
with
the
fact
that
the
information
received
by
the
informer
was,
as
petitioner
describes
it,
with
respect
to
a
future
crime.
i
note
that
the
first
information
received
was
that
draper
was
peddling
heroin
in
denver,
but
this
then
was
to
be
a
step
in
furtherance
of
his
peddling
narcotics
in
denver
in
which
he
was
already
engaged.
this
was
not
a
prediction
that
somebody
was
going
to
enter
the
narcotic
traffic.
this
was
a
statement
that
he
was
going
to
take
some
step
pursuant
to
this
illegal
activity.
we
don't
think
the
fact
that
this
related
to
a
future
event,
rendered
it
so
inherently
improbable
that
it
could
not
be
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
we
think
it
demonstrates
that
there
was
not
a
prior
opportunity
to
get
a
search
warrant,
to
get
an
arrest
warrant.
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
officers
knew
that
--
and
had
corroborated
the
fact
that
draper
was
committing
or
had
been
committing
a
crime
was
when
they
observed
him
in
the
railroad
station,
so
there
was
no
question
here
of
whether
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
have
obtained
a
warrant
because
there
was
no
such
opportunity.
when
information
is
received
by
law
enforcement
officer
that
x
has
narcotics
in
his
house
on
12th
street,
the
possibility
then
and
there
present
information,
the
possibility
always
existed
by
the
time
officers
will
get
to
12th
street,
the
narcotics
may
have
been
disposed
off.
so
here,
it
is
possible
that
draper
may
not
have
in
fact
gone
all
the
way
to
chicago
or
may
have
been
unsuccessful
in
his
attempt
to
get
the
narcotics.
these
things
we
think
show
that
there
was
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
with
mathematical
certainty
but
that's
not
--
not
the
requirement
of
probable
cause.
again
if
i
may
in
brinegar,
this
court
said
in
language
which
appears
at
page
15
of
the
government's
brief,
"in
dealing
with
probable
cause,
however,
as
the
very
name
implies,
we
deal
with
probabilities.
these
are
not
technical.
they
are
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
of
everyday
life
on
which
reasonable
and
prudent
men,
not
legal
technicians,
act."
and
we
submit
that
reasonably,
reasonable
and
prudent
men
would
have
believed
that
when
all
the
other
information
supplied
by
this
informant
whose
information
from
the
past
had
always
proved
reliable
was
corroborated
that
the
final
and
ultimate
fact
that
he
was
carrying
heroin
that
enough
--
there
was
enough
reason
to
believe
that
that
too
would
be
corroborated
and
to
make
the
arrest.
finally,
we
emphasized
that
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
which
must
be
considered
in
judging
the
reasonableness
of
the
conduct,
again
the
fact
that
this
was
an
arrest
in
daylight
in
a
public
place.
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
--
that
the
quantum
of
evidence
which
police
officers
must
have
before
they
may
enter
a
private
dwelling,
the
extent
of
the
invasion
of
the
privacy
must
be
considered
in
balance
and
in
regard
to
the
quantum
of
information
they
have.
and
here
this
was
a
day
light
arrest
in
a
public
place,
the
search
was
only
of
the
person,
of
the
defendant
and
of
the
bag
which
was
in
his
immediate
physical
control.
both
courts
below
have
found
on
these
facts
that
probable
cause
existed
and
those
concurrent
findings
we
submit
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
