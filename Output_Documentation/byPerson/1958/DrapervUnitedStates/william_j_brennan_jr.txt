justice

j.
brennan,

suppose
the
government
agents
had
in
fact
accompanied
him,
unknown
to
him
on
the
train,
if
he
went
to
chicago,
assume
that
he
did,
and
then
lost
track
of
him
in
chicago,
happened
to
pick
him
up
again
on
the
train
coming
back
and
then
everything
else
had
happen
here
in
fact
happened.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
you
have
--
you're
suggesting
i
gather
is
that
before
there
may
be
an
arrest
of
probable
cause
there
must
be
some
conduct
on
his
part
observed
by
the
agents
from
which
reasonably
it
may
be
inferred
that
he's
committed
a
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
far
short
--
how
far
--
i
know
that.
i'm
trying
to
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
it
is
you
think
the
rule
should
be,
how
far
short
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
want
to
stay
out
of
this
case
for
a
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
more
than
the
circumstances
i
have
put
to
you
of
following
him
on
the
train
to
chicago,
now
what
more
beyond
that,
i
suggested
earlier
they
lost
him
in
chicago
and
picked
him
up
again
coming
back
on
the
train,
faced
into
his
destination
and
everything
else
happened
that
happened
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
then
how
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
much
more
than
--
what
should
have
happened
in
chicago,
they
should
not
have
lost
him
let's
say,
they
saw
him
stop
at
some
place,
and
he
came
out
and
they
followed
him
back
to
the
train,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
come
back
to
this
then,
somehow
you
want
--
you
want
him
to
do
something
from
which
reasonably
that
an
inference
may
be
drawn,
that
he
has
done
something
criminal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

based
on
actual
observation.
