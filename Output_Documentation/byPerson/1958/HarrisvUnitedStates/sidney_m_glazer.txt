mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
also
a
multiple
punishment
narcotic
case.
unlike
blockburger,
gore
and
greene,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
sale.
also
unlike
blockburger,
gore
and
greene,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
order
form
statute.
the
only
statutes
involved
in
this
case
are
the
stamp
act
requirement
statute
and
the
illegal
import
statute.
the
question,
primary
question
for
consideration
is
whether
under
a
charge
of
purchasing
narcotic
drugs
from
an
unstamped
package,
and
receiving
and
concealing
the
same
drugs,
known
that
the
drugs
have
been
illegally
imported,
a
defendant
may
be
given
consecutive
sentences
under
proof
of
mere
possession
and
under
instructions
which
do
not
try
to
distinguish
the
elements
of
one
statute
from
the
elements
in
the
other
statute.
now,
section
4704
of
title
26
not
only
makes
sale
an
offense,
it
makes
purchase,
sale,
dispensing
and
distributing
drugs,
except
in
original
stamped
packages,
a
crime
and
that
statute
has
a
presumption
which
provides
that
the
absence
of
stamps
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation
by
the
person
in
whose
possession
the
narcotic
drug
may
be
found.
the
other
statute
involved
is
the
import
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
either
import
or
receive,
conceal,
buy,
sell,
or
in
any
manner
facilitate
the
transportation,
concealment
or
sale
of
narcotic
drugs
after
import
knowing
that
the
drugs
have
been
illegally
imported.
again,
there
is
a
presumption
which
provides
that
possession
of
the
narcotic
drugs
shall
be
sufficient
evidence
to
constitute
a
--
a
conviction
of
a
violation
of
this
statute.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
defendant
received
the
maximum
sentence
in
each
--
on
each
of
the
two
counts,
or
at
that
--
at
that
time,
the
maximum
sentence
was
five
years
and
so
he
received
a
consecutive
sentence
of
10
years.
now,
the
government's
case,
the
evidence
in
the
government's
case
show
that
there
were
two
police
officers
standing
on
cans
peered
into
windows
of
an
apartment
and
they
saw
three
individuals.
one
police
officer
testified
that
he
saw
the
two
codefendants,
not
the
--
not
the
petitioner
handling
some
powder.
the
other
officer
testified
that
the
--
he
saw
the
defendant
with
something
in
his
hand,
but
he
did
know
what
it
was.
the
officers
announced
who
they
were
and
all
three
occupants
of
the
room
fled
and
the
officers
found
filled
and
unfilled
capsules
of
narcotic
drugs.
they
found
some
capsules
in
a
woman's
coat.
they
found
narcotic
power
on
the
mirror
and
--and
they
also
found
a
needle
and
syringe.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
defense
in
this
case,
this
petitioner
was
in
alibi
that
he
wasn't
there
at
the
time
and
place
the
crime
was
committed.
somebody
else
testified
that
he,
not
petitioner
was
in
the
room
and
this
alibi
naturally
was
rejected
by
the
jury.
now,
the
instructions
are
very
important
in
this
case
and
they
are
set
out
on
--
the
pertinent
instructions
are
set
out
on
page
7,
8
and
9
of
our
brief.
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
by
first
reading
the
statutes
involved.
they
next
instructed
the
jury
by
reading
the
presumptions.
he
then
read
each
count
of
the
indictment.
then
the
court
immediately
after
reading
each
count
of
the
indictment
said,
“so,
the
question
under
each
count
of
this
indictment
resolves
down
to
whether
or
not
the
defendants
or
either
of
them
did
possess
this
narcotic
drug
on
the
8th
day
of
february,
of
this
year,
out
there
in
the
room
at
4567
mcmillan.”
then
the
court
stated
that
under
count
1
that
possession
was
prima
facie
evidence
and
significantly,
the
court
said,
this
is
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
“so
if
you
find
and
believe
from
all
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendants
or
either
of
them
possessed
the
narcotics
mentioned
in
count
1
and
that
the
said
narcotics
did
not
bear
the
required
internal
revenue
tax
stamps,
then
you
will
find
the
defendants
or
either
of
them
guilty
as
charged
in
count
1.”
then
the
court
gave
a
similar
instruction
under
--
for
count
2,
the
difference
being
instead
of
saying
that
you
will
find
the
defendants
guilty,
the
court
said
that
possession
would
authorize
--
would
authorize
the
conviction
of
the
defendants
under
count
2.
then
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
unless
you
find
that
the
defendants
had
possession,
that
you
must
acquit
the
defendants.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
a
theory
that
the
single
act
of
possession
justified
cumulative
sentence
--
sentences
and
that
the
court
instructed
the
--
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
as
to
the
necessary
elements
required
for
a
--
for
a
conviction.
now,
the
first
problem
involved
is,
what
did
the
blockburger
and
gore
cases
hold?
in
blockburger,
there
was
a
sale
involving
--
and
blockburger
was
charged
under
the
order
form
statute
and
the
stamp
package
statute.
the
order
forms
statute
doesn't
have
any
presumption,
so
blockburger
did
not
have
that
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
you
could
get
cumulative
punishments
from
this
substantially
similar
presumption.
the
gore
case,
one
count
involved
the
order
form,
that's
not
--
that
statute
isn't
involved
in
this
case.
the
other
two
counts
in
gore,
gore
was
charged
with
the
purchase,
sale
and
distribution
of
narcotic
drugs
from
unstamped
package
in
one
of
the
other
counts,
and
in
the
last
count
he
was
charged
with
transport
--
transporting
and
concealing
illegally
imported
drugs.
the
evidence
in
the
gore
case
show
that
gore
delivered
narcotic
drugs
to
a
government
agent
in
an
unstamped
package
without
any
of
the
use
of
any
order
form.
so,
the
gore
case
really
didn't
involve
the
question
whether
or
not
there
was
a
conviction
on
both
presumptions.
now,
these
presumptions
have
been
said
to
place
on
the
defendant,
the
duty
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
and
their
vice
consist
in
the
fact
that
different
offenses
may
be
presumed
in
an
essence
from
the
same
fact.
in
other
words
should
you
find
--
if
the
jury
finds
that
the
defendant
had
possession
of
the
drugs,
then
the
burden
of
furnishing
an
explanation
shifts
to
the
defendant
and
if
he
doesn't
furnish
a
satisfactory
explanation,
he
can
receive,
according
to
the
court
below,
cumulative
sentences.
now,
the
blockburger
test
which
was
referred
to
in
the
preceding
argument,
we
don't
believe,
would
require
the
imposition
of
cumulative
sentences.
and
under
that
test,
the
test
is
whether
each
provision
requires
proofs
--
proof
of
--
of
an
additional
fact
which
the
other
does
not.
well,
here,
congress
itself
has
said,
by
these
presumption
statutes
that
different
proof
isn't
required.
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
congress
hasn't
spoken
as
to
what
the
proof
is,
but
here
congress
in
the
very
statute,
in
the
very
statutes
in
which
it
creates
the
crime,
sets
out
what
proof.
in
effect,
congress
has
made
possession
the
crime.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i
don't
think
--
on
--
if
all
they
put
in
proof,
whether
there
was
an
unstamped
package,
i
don't
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
if
--
if
all
the
--
if
the
extra
proof
was
an
unstamped
package,
i
don't
think
there
should
be
a
multiple
sentence
for
this
reason.
in
--
the
original
narcotics
statute
was
the
import
statute.
that
was
in
1909
and
that
has
a
--
had
a
presumption.
the
next
statute
was
the
harrison
act
and
originally,
the
harrison
--
harrison
act,
that
imposed
the
order
form
statute
and
there
--
there
was
also
a
registration
requirement.
now,
there
was
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
which
held
that
the
1914
harrison
act
registration
requirement
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor,
i'm
--
i
don't
mean
to
go
back
over
gore.
i
--
i
just
want
to
refer
to
the
reason
for
enacting
the
presumption
in
the
stamp
act.
the
reason
for
enacting
that
presumption
in
the
stamp
act
was
to
be
sure
the
possessor
should
be
punished.
also
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
impossible
for
anybody
in
one
sense,
the
tax
is
imposed
upon
all
narcotics
drugs,
and
tax
has
to
be
evidenced
by
the
stamp.
and
it's
impossible
to
import
any
--
any
narcotic
drugs
for
the
purpose
of
making
heroin
out
of
it,
so
from
one
point
of
view
all
narcotic
drugs,
all
heroin,
at
least,
would
be
unstamped.
now,
i
think
you
have
a
different
situation
if
--
if
there
was
a
purchase
involved
in
--
in
the
two
counts,
if
one
count
had
a
--
if
--
if
there
was
an
--
if
evidence
--
there
was
actual
evidence
of
a
purchase,
then
it
may
be
that
you
could
impose
consecutive
sentences,
because
the
--
there
would
be
a
little
difference
between
the
two
charges.
in
other
words,
the
evidence
would
be
a
little
different,
but
in
the
absence
of
--
of
some
evidence
of
a
--
of
a
purchase,
i
don't
think
this
--
this
whole
business
of
presumptions
set
forth
in
time,
all
are
--
are
based
on
the
question
whether
or
not
something
logically
followed.
these
presumptions
and
the
whole
theory
of
shifting
the
burden,
the
prayer
or
the
reason
for
that
rule
is
to
convict
a
defendant
where
it's
very
difficult
or
impossible
for
the
government
to
obtain
the
necessary
evidence.
now,
i
think
it
may
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
person
in
possession
has
violated
one
--
one
narcotic
statute.
but
just
because
a
man
has
possession
doesn't
necessarily
mean
he
was
a
purchaser.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
three
people
in
the
room.
now,
it
all
--
it
may
be
that
one
person
purchased
the
narcotic
drugs
and
the
other
two
didn't
come
into
the
picture
until
after
the
purchase.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
aid
and
abet
the
purchase,
but
their
--
but
their
function
may
have
been
to
assist
in
the
disposition
of
the
narcotic
drug.
so,
actually,
the
presumption,
as
applied
in
that
case,
in
effect,
is
they
are
convicting
--
convicting
a
man
of
--
of
an
extra
crime.
a
crime
which
doesn't
--
which
i
don't
think
logically
follows
and
--
and
which,
i
don't
see
the
reason
when
you're
basing
this
thing
on
a
presumption
to
have
two
sort
of
substantially
similar
presumptions,
when
the
whole
purpose
of
the
presumption
is
to
apply
to
a
situation
where
you
do
not
know
what
the
wrong
is
and
you
say,
“well,
the
man
has
done
some
wrong
in
connection
with
the
narcotic
law.
if
he
can't
come
forward
with
--
with
an
explanation
he
should
be
punished.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
in
gore,
as
i
read
the
majority
opinion,
the
--
the
--
there
was
no
issue
concerning
how
the
conviction
was
brought
about.
in
other
words,
the
only
issue
was
whether
under
a
specific
indictment
the
man
could
receive
these
consecutive
sentences.
also
in
gore,
the
evidence
actually
did
show,
and
it's
pointed
out
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
4
in
the
gore
case,
that
the
man
did
sell
narcotic
drugs,
brought,
sell
and
deliver
narcotic
drugs
to
a
federal
agent
in
an
unstamped
package.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
of
the
sale,
there
was
an
actual
delivery
of
narcotic
drug
in
an
unstamped
package.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
gore
was
a
section
2255.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
this
was
a
direct
appeal
from
the
conviction.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
your
honor,
we
were
not
trial
counsel
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
there
--
there
were
none
except
that
one
of
the
trial
--
one
of
the
lawyers
said,
he
accepted
every
charge
not
given
by
instruction
not
requested
by
the
defendant.
but
the
record
doesn't
show
what
that
consisted
of.
there
were
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
that's
our
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
did
that,
your
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
it
--
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
significantly,
three
places,
number
one,
he
said
that
the
question
resolves
down
whether
or
not
defendant
had
possession.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
--
and
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
--
i
could
judge.
and
i
think
judge
harper
tries
to
be
fair,
but
the
end
result
of
this
thing,
here
you
have
two
--
two
presumptions.
they
are
substantially
similar
if
there
is
some
difference
between
them.
if
you
do
not
--
if
you
do
not
clearly
and
distinctly
tell
the
jury
that
it's
not
enough
to
just
find
possession,
then
you
really
do
is
you
just
lump,
merge
the
two
crimes,
you
lump
them
together
and
there
becomes
no
difference
at
all.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
then
on
page
111
your
honor,
he
repeats,
he
says,
“so
if
you
find
and
believe
from
all
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
defendants
or
either
of
them
possessed
the
narcotics
mentioned
in
count
1,
and
he
--
and
that
the
said
narcotics
did
not
bear
the
required
internal
revenue
tax
stamps,
then
you
will
find
the
defendants
or
either
of
them
guilty
as
charged
in
count
1.”
and
now,
then
further
down
on
page
111
he
says,
“the
court
instructs
the
jury
that
unless
you
find
that
the
defendants
or
either
of
them
had
possession
of
the
narcotics
mentioned,
and
unless
you
find
that
such
narcotics
were
under
the
dominion
and
control,
then
you
must
acquit
the
defendants
or
either
of
them
who
did
not
have
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
in
--
in
any
event,
the
--
the
evidence
only
did
show
possession
and
there
is
really
--
there
is
no
real
distinction
if
you
look
at
this
blockburger
rule
which
says
whether
or
not
this
--
the
test
--
whether
one
transaction
shall
be
the
basis
of
--
of
double
punishment
or
not
is
whether
or
not
they
--
the
--
each
offense
requires
an
element
which
the
other
one
doesn't,
an
additional
fact,
here
in
effect
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
before
sitting
down,
i
want
to
answer
an
argument
of
mr.
murphy
which
he
made
in
the
greene
case.
mr.
murphy
stated
that
one
reason
why
cumulative
punishment
might
be
imposed
is
because
these
two
presumptions
are
different.
now,
this
is
an
argument
which
he
didn't
make
in
his
brief,
and
his
argument,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
the
import
presumption
applies
whether
or
not
the
drug
is
stamped,
whereas
the
stamp
act
presumption
only
applies
when
the
drug
is
stamped.
it
is
our
position
in
this
regard
that
--
that
in
dealing
with
the
import
presumption,
there
is
only
one
valid
presumption
which
can
be
drawn.
in
other
words,
if
the
narcotic
drugs
are
stamped,
even
under
the
import
presumption,
you
cannot
presume
that
the
person
in
whose
possession
the
drugs
are
found
knows
that
the
drugs
were
imported
contrary
to
law.
in
other
words,
anybody
who
has
a
package
of
stamped
drugs
and
if
that's
the
only
evidence,
you
couldn't
sustain
a
conviction
even
--
even
though
this
--
the
--
the
presumption
statute
is
--
is
broad
enough
to
--
on
its
face
to
either
apply
to
stamped
or
unstamped
narcotics.
but
anytime,
anybody
would
have
stamped
narcotics
in
their
possession,
you
couldn't
sustain
a
conviction
based
on
the
presumption
because
they
--
you
--
the
evidence
would
not
show
that
they
knew
the
--
the
drugs
were
imported
contrary
to
law.
the
presumption
wouldn't
--
such
a
presumption
wouldn't
be
rational,
there
wouldn't
be
a
--
a
rational
connection
between
the
presumption
and
the
fact
proved.
and
in
that
regard,
i
refer
to
the
tot
case
where
this
court
said,
it
is
not
permissible
to
shift
the
burden
by
arbitrarily
making
one
fact
which
has
no
relevance
of
guilt
to
the
offense,
the
occasion
of
casting
on
the
defendant
the
obligation
of
exculpation.in
other
words,
the
--
both
presumptions
are
only
applicable
if
the
package
is
unstamped.
now,
under
these
circumstances,
since
the
presumptions
are
alike,
since
the
evidence
is
the
same
to
permit
double
punishment,
is
to
permit
punishing
the
same
thing
by
placing
different
labels
on
the
same
act.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
morissette
case
also
refers
to
that
case
in
dealing
with
the
whole
issue
of
intent
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
--
and
says
there
is
no
intent
required
in
these
narcotic
drug
cases.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
in
the
morissette
case,
the
--
the
court
held
that
even
though
the
--
a
--
a
statute
dealing
with
conversion
of
government
property
said
--
mentioned
nothing
about
intent,
intent
applied
and
in
dicta
referred
to
the
other
case
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
think
so.
referring
to
the
gore
case
on
page
4
of
the
government's
brief,
the
government
themselves
pointed
out
that
the
evidence
showed
that
gore
--
gore,
after
selling
to
a
narcotics
agent,
delivered
the
--
the
narcotics
to
an
agent
in
an
unstamped
package
without
use
of
any
order
form,
so
there
is
a
big
factual
distinction
between
gore
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
your
honor.
now,
in
reference
to
the
section
174,
although
it
says
possession
of
drugs,
stamped
or
unstamped,
it
makes
no
difference.
if,
for
example,
by
mistake,
the
government
stamped
a
package
of
heroin
instead
of
some
other
drugs
and
somebody
buy
--
in
--
i
don't
know
about
--
how
but
theoretically,
obtained
possession
of
them,
they
couldn't
be
convicted
of
--
of
violating
174
even
though
that
presumption
applies
to
possession
of
both
stamped
and
unstamped
drugs
because
if
there
were
valid
stamps
on
the
drugs,
a
man
could
not
knowingly
know
if
the
drugs
were
illegally
imported.
in
other
words,
the
presumption
would
be
contrary
to
the
evidence
and
therefore
that
part
of
the
preemption
is
meaningless.
the
only
part
of
that
174
presumption
to
have
any
meaning
is
the
--
that
has
to
mean
unstamped
drugs.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
maybe
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
was
--
maybe
i
did
answer
the
question
too
fast.
that
was
another
issue
in
the
case.
in
other
words,
initially,
in
1909,
congress
imposed
this
import
tax
and
then
there
came
a
decision.
then
the
harrison
act
which
dealt
with
the
order
form
and
--
and
registration
of
narcotics
drugs
was
enacted
in
1914.
then,
subsequently,
the
harrison
act,
an
individual
was
found
in
possession
of
drugs
and
the
court
held
that
because
he
was
a
person
who
could
not
register
under
any
circumstances,
he
could
not
be
found
guilty
of
having
possession
of
the
drugs.
as
a
result,
congress
enacted
the
stamp
act.
so,
there
is
a
--
a
--
some
question
of
congressional
intent
whether
congress
meant
for
a
conviction
for
--
for
double
punishment
to
be
applicable
if
the
conviction
rests
on
both
presumptions.
i
think
both
--
both
things
are
in
the
case.
there's
a
question
of
--
of
due
process,
whether
or
not
it's
--
it's
fair
for
this
presumption
to
apply
to
both
situations,
i
think
it
like
it
may
be
reasonable
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
defendant
for
one
situation,
whereas,
it
may
not
be
reasonable
to
do
it
for
both.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
certain
--
i
think
there
is
a
certain
inconsistency
perhaps,
in
many
of
these
situations
where
a
--
they
shift
the
burden
on
both
counts.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
defendant
should
have
to
explain
his
possession.it's
another
thing
to
--
to
punish
him
twice
for
situations
which
may
be
inconsistent.
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
may
be
that
while
congress
meant
the
shift
of
burden
to
him
once,
they
really
didn't
mean
to
shift
the
burden
to
him
twice.
in
other
words,
they
sort
of
meant
that
if
he
can't
explain,
he
should
face
punishment,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
intended
that
he
should
be
punished
twice.
it's
a
situation
where
i
think
the
rule
of
lenity
should
apply.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no
--
no,
your
honor.
