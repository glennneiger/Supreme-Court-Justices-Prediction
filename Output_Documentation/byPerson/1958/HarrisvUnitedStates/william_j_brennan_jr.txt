justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
glazer,
i
--
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
you
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
out
of
the
evidence
filed
though
to
anything
except
the
issue
of
dispossession
of
it
as
i
recall
he
pleaded
an
alibi,
did
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
was
there
--
except
for
the
testimony
that
this
substance
was
on
the
mirror,
was
there
any
other
testimony
that
related
specifically
to
the
heroin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
presumption
so
that
except
for
proof
then
of
possession
these
convictions
stand,
both
of
them,
upon
the
presumption
that's
drawn
from
his
failure
take
the
stand
and
explain
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
murphy,
am
i
--
am
i
correct
that
in
gore
there
was
an
affirmative
evidence
of
a
sale,
was
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
conviction
then
on
this
is,
are
we
dealing
now
with
174,
4704
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
both
of
them.
so,
that
there
was
at
least
affirmative
evidence
of
a
sale
by
gore.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
this
case,
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this.
here
we
have
absolutely
nothing
except
evidence
from
which
possession
was
proved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
let
--
let
me
see
if
i
follow
that.
you
mean
that
was
a
case
i
gather,
i
know
we've
had
it
there,
but
i
forgot
the
details,
was
that
like
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
gore?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
like
--
was
that
like
gore
in
the
sense
that
there
was
affirmative
evidence
of
a
sale,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
that,
on
the
authority
of
that
affirmative
evidence
he
didn't
rely
on
the
presumption
and
you
suggest
the
conviction
may
be
sustained
for
the
sale
under
the
statute
in
that
way,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
same
time
you
take
the
same
evidence
of
a
sale
and
you
say
that
that
justifies
use
of
the
presumption
to
establish
a
purchase?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
let
me
use
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
your
affirmative
testimony
was
that
he
sold
it,
not
that
he
bought
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
so?
and
on
the
strength
of
that
affirmative
testimony
you
support
the
conviction
for
sale.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you
turn
around
and
say
nevertheless
that
because
the
sale
involved
possession
that
also
entitles
you
to
a
conviction
for
purchase,
although
your
affirmative
testimony
is
not
that
he
purchased
but
that
he
sold,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
one
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
suppose,
somehow
rather
you
had
a
package
of
heroin
with
--
with
a
stamp
on
it,
secured
it
somehow
or
the
other,
would
that
obligate
a
conviction
under
this
statute
for
unstamped
when
the
stamp
is
not
lawfully
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
might
be
of
a
spurious
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
stamp
with
it
--
but
you
could
not
lawfully
have
as
i
understand
it,
a
stamped
package
of
heroin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
even
if
it
had
the
stamp
on
it,
you
could
have
a
conviction
for
possession
of
unstamped
narcotics.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what's
the
significance
of
the
so-called
ingredient
of
a
stamp
in
the
case
of
heroin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
doesn't
go
or
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
an
ingredient
then
to
proof
of
the
crime
at
all,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
there's
a
--
if
i
understand
you
now,
if
he
has
a
package
of
heroin
and
it
does
bear
a
stamp,
he
may,
nevertheless,
be
convicted
under
this
4704
was
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
--
in
relation
to
tax
paid
stamps,
you
could
still
be
convicted
under
that
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
you
have,
what
the
government
finds
on
it,
on
his
person
is
a
package
of
heroin
and
the
package
happens
to
bear
a
stamp.
and
that's
what
you
offer
in
evidence.
now,
as
i
understood
what
you've
just
answered
me,
he
could
be
convicted
for
possessing
heroin
in
an
unstamped
package
because
lawfully
he
could
not
have
a
stamped
package
of
heroin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
any
evidence
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
that
be
just
a
matter
of
law
once
you've
established
it's
heroin,
wouldn't
the
judge
have
to
say
the
presence
of
the
stamp
on
the
package's
meaning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
a
--
that's
not
a
matter
of
evidence
now,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
heroin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
however,
you
didn't
have
to
rely
on
the
presumption,
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
affirmative
evidence
of
a
sale.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
you
have
affirmative
evidence
which
is
nothing
but
confession
and
you
rely
on
the
presumption
of
the
same
conviction,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
here
you're
talking
about
ultimate
facts.
i
gather
you
mean
something
like
purchase,
sale
or
something
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
the
ultimate
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
looking
at
this
--
or
of
this
indictment
at
page
1
of
the
record,
i
gather
the
first
count
“did
unlawfully
purchase”,
you
might
equally
have
chosen
from
the
statute,
“did
unlawfully
sell,
did
unlawfully
dispense
or
did
unlawfully
distribute.”
you
didn't
have
to
pick
on
“did
unlawfully
purchase”
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
whether
you
do
or
not,
as
i
understood
your
colloquy
earlier,
you
might
as
well
have
picked
any
of
these
ultimate
facts,
so-called
from
the
statute,
sell,
dispense
or
distribute
rather
than
purchase
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
in
--
in
actual
fact
the
only
evidence
you
had,
was
evidence
of
possession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
--
and
then
you
say
from
possession
flows
either
purchase,
sale,
dispense
or
distribute,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
all
you
have
to
prove
to
establish
as
to
heroin
--
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
this,
a
case
under
4704
(a)
is
what
you
proved
here,
namely,
possession
of
powder
which
was
heroin
on
a
mirror.
that's
all
you
had
to
prove
and
you
could
have
a
conviction
on
that
proof
under
both
4704
(a)
and
174.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
couldn't
take
the
stand
and
no
matter
what
he
said
he
couldn't
act
or
play
themselves
under
4704
(a)
if
possession
was
of
heroin,
could
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
matter
--
no
matter
how
innocent
his
possession
of
it
really
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
couldn't
escape
--
and
he
might
escape
the
conviction
under
174,
but
he
couldn't.
in
other
words,
via
explanation
he
might,
under
that
section
that
he
could
not
escape
under
4704
(a).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
under
4704
(a)
is
there
any
--
any
ingredient
of
knowing
possession,
in
other
words
he
may
--
suppose
he
got
to
stand,
“well,
i
thought
this
was
talcum
powder.”
and
he
honestly
thought
it
was
talcum
powder.
the
jury
chose
not
to
acquit
him
on
that
ground.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
the
jury
find
the
possession
be
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
actual
heroin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
he
could
be
convicted
even
though
he
believed
that
it
was
--
honestly
believed
it
was
talcum
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
language
in
the
statute
which
makes
it
necessary
that
he
know
he
has
heroin
in
his
possession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
--
in
other
words,
the
affirmative
evidence
of
all
those
elements
of
the
case.
