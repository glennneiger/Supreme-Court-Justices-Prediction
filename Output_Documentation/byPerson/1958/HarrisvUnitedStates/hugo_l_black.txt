you

what

the
objections

this

this
charge?
justice

l.
black
were
there
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
in
the
discharge
as
guilty
and
a
charge
with
contempt
that
told
the
jury
if
you
believe
this
man
is
guilty
of
possessing
this
drug,
you
convict
him
of
possessing
an
unstamped
drug.
and
in
fact,
there's
a
general
charge
if
you
believe
he
is
guilty
of
possessing
this
drug,
he
is
guilty
of
possessing
an
unstamped
drug.
and
if
you
believe
he
is
guilty
of
possessing
the
drug,
you
--
he
is
guilty
of
the
other
charge.
is
any
--
and
it
seems
to
me
like
if
his
charge
as
given,
i
don't
know
where
that
objection
was
made.
in
fact,
the
amount
is
the
equivalent
of
the
charge
that
he
must
be
convicted
if
they
found
he
possessed
the
drug.

doing
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
quite
get
from
you,
what
was
he
charged
with
under
the
first
count,
sale
or
purchase?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
purchase.
justice
hugo
l.

purchase
knowing
it
to
have
been
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
or
from
the
original.
justice
hugo
l.
black
possession
is
enough
to
convict
the
purchase,
sale
and
what
else?
does
is
mention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
they
might
have
picked
out
sale
instead
of
purchase,
or
they
picked
up
concealment
instead
of
purchase
and
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
your
case
be
any
different
if
you
had,
had
counts
for
--
had
convicted
him
for
purchasing
on
the
presumption,
selling
on
the
presumption,
dispensing
on
the
presumption
and
distributing
on
the
presumption
under
section
4704?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
why
would
it
exhaust
itself
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
but
they
have
--
the
statute
makes
sale,
purchase,
dispense
or
there's
distribution
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
four
--
four
separate
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
in
that
regard
mr.
murphy,
did
i
--
counsel
argued
yesterday
did
someone
suggest
to
us
that
there
are
certain
narcotics
which
could
never
lawfully
have
to
be
stamped.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
it's
not
permissible
for
anyone
to
possess
heroin
in
this
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
prohibits
importation,
manufacturing,
processing,
use,
possession
or
anything
else
in
connection
with
heroin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
couldn't
explain
anything
about
the
stamp.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
there
was
a
legal
difference,
there
is
a
legal
conceptual
difference,
and
if
--
but
no
practical
difference.
insofar
as
the
case
is
concerned
if
he
possesses
heroin,
he
is
in,
under
this
statute
or
any
other,
he
is
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
practically
speaking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
conceptually,
there's
a
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
draw
that
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
wondered
if
you
didn't
answer
one
question
in
the
little
paragraph.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
to
understand
from
you
that
you
think
the
only
question
here
is
whether
under
due
process,
this
presumption
can
exist?
i
thought
you
had
the
question
that
as
to
whether
congress,
number
(1)
had
or
number
(2)
could
prosecute
one
man
twice
for
having
possession
of
a
drug?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
now
--
that
--
but
you
are
not
--
i
agree
that
(inaudible)
due
process
question
that
lead
to
the
presumption
you
share,
but
you
are
not
saying
that's
the
only
question
(voice
overlap)
