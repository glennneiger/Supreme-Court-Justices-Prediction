mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
two
offenses
under
the
narcotics
laws.
the
offenses
grew
out
of
a
single
transaction
which
occurred
on
the
morning
of
february
8th,
1956.
on
that
morning,
the
petitioner
and
two
other
people,
another
man
and
a
woman,
were
in
a
room
in
st.
louis,
missouri
and
two
officers
of
the
st.
louis
police
department
observed
them
through
the
window
doing
what
is
known
in
the
trade
as
capping
narcotics.
the
petitioner
was
clearly
observed
by
at
least
one
of
these
officers.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
capping
narcotics.
they
had
the
bulk
narcotics
spread
out
on
a
mirror
upon
a
bed
in
the
room
and
they
were
engaged
in
placing
these
bulk
narcotics
into
capsules
for
distribution,
sale.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
was
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
your
honor,
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
gist
of
the
transaction
is
possession
of
--
of
the
drug.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
was
upon
a
mirror.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
was
--
they
were
using
the
mirror
simply
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
as
a
glass.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
officers
not
immediately
being
able
to
gain
entrance
to
the
room
after
announcing
their
identity
broke
into
the
room,
but
by
that
time
the
occupants
had
departed
via
the
window.
subsequently,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
or
at
least
he
--
fighting
out
that
he
--
he
was
identified
and
--
and
could
be
easily
apprehended,
he
gave
himself
up.
now,
he
was
charged
in
an
indictment
containing
two
counts.
the
first
count
was
laid
under
section
4704
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
of
course,
and
that
section
provides
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
purchase,
sell,
dispense
or
distribute,
narcotic
drugs
except
in
the
original
stamp
package
or
from
the
original
stamp
package
and
the
absence
of
appropriate
tax
paid
stamps
from
narcotic
drugs
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation
of
this
section
by
the
person
in
whose
possession
the
same
may
be
found.
the
second
count
was
laid
upon
a
violation
of
section
174
of
title
21,
which
is
a
part
of
the
narcotic
drugs
export
import
act
and
that
prohibits
or
provides
that
whoever
fraudulently
or
knowingly
imports
or
brings
any
narcotic
drug
into
the
united
states,
or
any
territory
under
its
control
or
jurisdiction
contrary
to
law
or
receives,
conceals,
buys,
sells,
or
in
any
manner
facilitates
the
transportation,
concealment
or
sale
of
any
such
narcotic
drug
after
being
imported
or
brought
in
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
imported
contrary
to
law,
or
conspires
to
commit
any
such
acts
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
shall
be
fined
and
so
forth.
for
a
second
offense,
which
is
not
relevant
here,
section
174
contains
a
presumption
which
is
set
forth
on
page
4
of
our
brief
whenever
on
trial
for
a
violation
of
this
subsection,
the
defendant
is
shown
to
have
or
to
have
had
possession
of
the
narcotic
drug,
such
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
the
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
now
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
sentenced
under
the
first
count
to
a
term
of
five
years
imprisonment.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
purchase.
sir,
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
think
i
mentioned
that.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
purchase
of
224
grains
of
heroin.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
not
in
or
from
the
original
stamped
package.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
and
in
the
second
count
he
was
charged
with
receiving
and
concealing
and
facilitating
the
receipt
and
concealment
of
the
same
drug,
the
same
quantity,
224
grains.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
his
defense
was
alibi,
yes.
he
claimed
that
he
was
not
present
in
the
room
on
that
occasion.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
was
not
--
the
government's
case
was
founded
upon
the
presumption.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
the
sole
evidence
related
to
the
observation
of
the
offices
of
the
defendant
in
this
room
with
the
narcotics.
there
was
no
other
evidence.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
under
section
4704
yes.
and
--
and
also
under
section
174,
which
prohibits
buying,
the
presumption
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
the
--
the
presumption
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
under
section
174,
the
presumption
provides
that
whenever
on
trial
for
a
violation
of
this
subsection,
the
defendant
is
shown,
to
have
had
possession,
such
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
his
possession.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
conviction
of
all
of
the
elements.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
just
says,
“authorize
conviction.”
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
statute
prohibits
buying,
selling,
receiving,
concealing
or
in
any
manner
facilitating
the
transportation,
concealment,
or
sale
of
any
such
narcotic
drugs.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
in
this
case
they
picked
out
receive
and
conceal
and
facilitate
the
receipt
and
concealment.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
there
was.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
are
dealing
with
both
of
them
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
only
fact
which
differentiates
this
case
from
gore.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
exactly
the
government's
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
position.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
and
--
and,
of
course,
in
the
casey
case
this
following
language
was
stated.
“in
dealing
with
a
poison
not
commonly
used
except
upon
a
doctor's
prescription
easily
proved,
or
for
a
debauch
only
possible
by
a
breach
of
law,
it
seems
reasonable
to
call
on
a
person
possessing
it
in
a
form
that
warrants
suspicion
to
show
that
he
obtained
it
in
a
mode
permitted
by
the
law.”
so
the
--
the
burden
is
upon
the
defendant
once
the
government
proves
that
he
had
possession
of
the
drug
under
section
174
and
under
4704
that
he
had
possession
of
the
drug
and
that
they
did
not
contain
appropriate
tax
paid
stamps.
the
government
may
call
upon
the
defendant
to
explain
his
possession.
this
is
a
--
a
presumption
which
has
been
declared
to
be
reasonably
related
to
the
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
it
would
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
would
not,
we
would
not
there
contend
solely
upon
proof
arising
out
of
the
presumption
that
he
had
committed
several
different
offenses.
the
--
we
could
in
an
appropriate
case
charge
a
person
with
purchasing
and
with
selling
and
with
distributing,
if
we
had
separate
evidence
to
prove
each
of
those
offenses,
because
we
say
that
congress
defined
several
different
offenses
in
each
of
these
statutes.
but
when
it
comes
to
relying
upon
the
presumption
if
we
must
do
that
then
it's
only
reasonable
to
say
that
the
presumption
can
only
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation
of
the
statute,
not
of
each
element
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
i
think
it's
due
to
the
language
used
in
these
presumptions,
“shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction.”
they
must
mean
conviction
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there'd
certainly
room
for
interpretation
there,
mr.
justice
black
but
insofar
as
we
have
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
base
it
on
the
logic
that
the
presumption
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
violation
of
these
statutes,
not
of
each
element.
and
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
court
would
in
such
a
case
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
to
construe
that
presumption
is
authorizing
only
one
conviction
in
that
circumstance.
now
in
the
--
the
yancey
case
we
have
the
situation
where
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
two
crimes
under
the
single
statute.
but
there
we
relied
upon
the
presumption
for
proof
of
the
purchase
and
we
relied
upon
explicit
testimony
for
proof
of
the
sale.
so
we
had
two
distinct
violations
proved
by
distinct
evidence.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
was
on
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
petition
now
which
has
not
been
acted
on.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
proof
of
the
possession
of
the
drug.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
possession
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
may
be
incidental
to
the
sale.
(voice

--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
we
rely
for
one
offense
upon
the
presumption
and
the
direct
explicit
testimony
for
the
other.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
you
want
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
true.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
is
that
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it's
the
beyond
the
power
(voice

--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
nothing,
sir,
nothing.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct
and
heroin
is
one
of
them.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
that
is
completely
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
off
the
hook.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
the
stamp
would
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
obviously
be
spurious
in
that
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
in
the
case
of
heroin
there
is
no
real
significance,
no
practical
significance.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
that's
the
--
the
fact
that
heroin
can't
be
stamped
is
merely
incidental.
the
--
the
petitioner
has
placed
himself
in
the
position
of
possessing
heroin
rather
than
some
other
drug
which
is
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
would
assume
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
now,
this
--
this
is
an
impossible
situation,
of
course,
but
--
but
assuming
that
the
defendant
attempted
to
show
that
his
possession
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
would
you
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
it
wouldn't
be
because
he
had
it
in
an
unstamped
package
precisely.
it
--
it
would
be
because
we
would
show
that
the
stamp
was
not
lawfully
put
on
there.
that
the
--
the
stamp
is
merely
evidence
of
the
payment
of
the
tax
if
he
has
not
paid
the
tax
on
that
drug
then
he
couldn't
lawfully
have
paid
any
tax
on
heroin,
then
couldn't
have
a
lawful
tax
stamp
on
there.
and
we
could
show
that
as
part
of
our
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
would
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
i
would
presume
that,
that
would
be
a
fair
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
at
the
time
of
this
case,
it
was
not.
under
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956,
the
provision
is
now
codified,
i
think
at
18
u.s.c.
1402,
heroin
is
outlawed
and
possession
of
it
cannot
be
lawful,
but
there
is
no
penalty
for
it.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
they
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
upon
the
commerce
power.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
only
--
that's
the
only
way
you
can
obtain
heroin.
there
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
is
no
legal
way
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
in
which
heroin
can
be
manufactured
in
this
country.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
not
under
that
section,
no
sir,
but
the
section
4704
is
predicated
under
the
revenue
power.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
of
course,
congress
could
also
tax
that
which
it
also
prohibits.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it's
still
on
heroin.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
i
--
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
--
that
it's
a
violation
under
the
stamp
tax
provision
to
purchase
heroin,
not
even
from
the
original
stamped
package,
even
though
heroin
maybe
completely
illegal.
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
what
congress
--
to
--
to
tax
that
which
it
also
prohibits.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
your
honor
it
is
not.
now
this
case
with
this
rather
fine
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
he
could
not
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
prescribe
heroin.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
he
could
not
prescribe
it.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there
is
no
legal
heroin
available.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
some
of
the
doctors
don't
like
that.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
congress
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
congress
places
a
tax
on
the
manufacture
or
importation
of
all
narcotic
drug.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
including
heroin,
any
narcotic
drug,
any
derivative
of
opium,
and
heroin
is
certainly
that.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
also
prohibits
the
importation
of
opium
for
the
purpose
of
manufacturing
heroin.
in
effect,
it
prohibits
the
importation
of
heroin.
no
heroin
can
be
obtained
into
this
country.
it
hasn't
been
able
--
there
has
been
no
heroin
imported
for
some
30
years.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
now,
this
case,
we
think,
is
indistinguishable
from
gore.
in
gore,
the
issue
was
whether
one
transaction,
there
a
sale,
could
support
three
consecutive
sentences.
here
the
transaction
involved
is
possession.
but
there
is
no
difference
in
principle
between
those
two
transactions.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
in
--
in
gore,
i
--
i
hesitate
to
get
back
into
the
refinements
of
that
case.
but
we
did
charge
under
the
stamp
tax
act
and
i
do
believe
that
we
relied
in
part
upon
the
presumption
in
that
case.
but
there
was
a
distinct
evidence
of
sale.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that.
now,
petitioner's
contention
is
that
he
can't
be
convicted
under
these
two
statutes
because
he
is,
in
effect,
being
convicted
under
the
same
evidence.
and,
of
course,
this
was
an
issue
which
was
raised
in
the
gore
case.
and
i
would
like,
first
of
all,
to
set
at
rest
a
question
which
came
up
yesterday
as
to
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
gore
case
and
this
one,
because
the
gore
case
came
up
on
a
2255
motion.
gore
did
come
up
in
that
way
but
it
is
a
fact
that
gore
was
decided
on
the
merits
and
the
record
was
before
this
court.
in
the
gore
brief,
i
think
it's
at
page
5.
there
is
a
footnote
which
says,
“the
testimony
appears
in
the
certified
record
of
the
official
court
reporter
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.”
and
certainly
it's
incontrovertible
that
the
gore
opinion
was
bottomed
on
the
fact
that
a
single
transaction
was
involved.
and
it
tells,
of
course,
that
congress
could
make
a
single
transaction
violative
of
three
different
offenses.
now,
petitioner
misconstrues
the
same
evidence
rule,
which
is
used
to
determine
the
identity
or
differentiation
between
offenses,
read
quickly
the
same
evidence
rule,
would
we
want
to
conclude
that
if
you
use
the
same
evidence
you
can
convict
of
different
offenses.
but
that,
in
fact,
is
not
really
what
the
rule
means.
the
rule
in
--
it
is
our
contention,
has
to
do
with
the
elements
of
the
effects.
the
confusion
results,
of
course,
because
the
elements
of
the
--
of
an
--
of
any
offense
are
defined
usually
in
terms
of
facts.
and
the
cases
speak
about
whether
there
is
this
proof
of
the
same
fact
required
or
different
facts.
and
the
primary
evidence
to
prove
those
ultimate
facts
are
usually
very
closely
related,
if
need
--
indeed
identical
with
the
facts
necessitating
a
conviction
under
the
--
the
statute.
here,
of
course,
we
are
somewhat
removed
from
the
close
relationship
between
the
primary
evidentiary
facts
and
the
ultimate
fact
which
you
usually
find
in
a
case,
because
of
the
application
of
the
presumption.
but
never
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
don't
normally
charge
a
sale
when
we
are
going
to
rely
upon
the
presumption.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
theoretically
yes,
but
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
congress
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
have
the
--
the
possession
under
one
statute
alone
and
possession
without
the
stamps
under
the
other
statute.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i'll
have
to
answer
that
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
not
under
any
drug.
there
is
a
peculiar
circumstance
in
the
case
of
heroin
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
can't
purchase
legally.
so
that
you
could
never
have
tax
stamps
on
heroin,
but
that
is
the
circumstance.
legally,
the
offenses
are
different
and
you
can
have
possession
of
a
drug,
for
instance,
a
--
a
commercially
manufactured
drug,
and
it
can
--
that
possession
can
be
violative
of
section
174,
while
not
violative
of
section
4704
as
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
of
174.
and
if
there
are
no
tax
stamps
on
the
drugs
as
there
cannot
be
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
then
it
also
raises
a
presumption
of
violation
of
4704,
yes,
but
that
is
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
because
there
is
a
legal
inference
that
there
were
no
stamps
on
the
drug.
now
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
it
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
you
just
raised
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
a
--
a
very
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
important
distinction.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
was
the
holding
in
the
casey
case,
that's
right.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
practically
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
oh
yes,
conceptually
there
is
a
vast
difference.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
he
could
not.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
he
is
the
one
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
he
is
the
one
who
has
---
has
put
himself
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
--and
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
he
can
show
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
would
be
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
under
section
174,
the
statute
says
that
he
must
know
that
the
drug
has
been
unlawfully
imported.
of
course,
the
presumption
sets
up
and
supplies
that
element
of
proof.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
if
the
jury
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
jury
is
under
no
obligation
to
believe
the
defendant
at
all.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact.
if
the
jury
doesn't
believe
him
he
had
--
he
didn't
--
he
wasn't
ignorant.
but
if
the
jury
believes
then
they
acquit
him.
so,
he
can't
contend
that
he
was
ignorant
and
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
there
is
not.
not
under
174
to
my
knowledge
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
that
it
has
been
held
that
is
strictly
a
malum
prohibitum
and
--
and
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
