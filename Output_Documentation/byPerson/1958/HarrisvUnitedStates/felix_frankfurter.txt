justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
doesn't
that
leave
out
of
account
that
while
he
did
say
that
in
the
beginning,
didn't
judge
harper,
in
this
rather
lengthy
charge,
afterward
particularize?
he
not
only
quoted
the
statute,
but
he
quoted
what
the
different
needs
of
the
two
provisions
were
in
great
detail
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
did
what
federal
judges
do
not
always
do,
but
i
wish
they
would,
give
the
contentions
of
both
the
plaintiff
--
of
the
government
and
of
the
defendants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
true?
isn't
that
all
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
was
his
opening
--
general
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
what
in
a
human
way
got
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
he
didn't
have
the
possession,
he
couldn't
have
been
guilty
either
of
clandestinely
importing
it
or
of
selling
without
a
license
--
without
a
stamp.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
just
the
colloquial
way
of
talking
to
the
jury,
so
that
they
could
understand
it,
instead
of
talking
legal
jargon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
be
you
with
if
he'd
stopped
--
if
he
--
if
he
said,
“no
more
or
well
done”,
what
he
said
on
page
107.
i
would
be
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
then
he
stated,
it
seems
to
me
that
was
articulating,
he
was
talking
to
these
laymen
about
what
was
the
real
knob
of
that
issue.
if
this
fellow
didn't
possess
the
narcotics,
then
he
could
not
be
guilty
of
either
one
of
the
two
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
he
said
that,
he
also
said
the
things
on
page
110
and
particularized
the
difference
between
count
1
and
count
2,
the
contentions
of
the
prosecution
and
then
with
great
particularity,
he
gave
the
contentions
of
the
defendant.
and
i
agree
with
you
that
possibly
close
--
closely
attuned
counsel
would
have
said,
“will
your
honor
make
it
clear
that
merely
possession
isn't
enough
in
the
case
at
all?
but
to
me,
you
have
read
in
my
life
and
have
read
a
great
many
charges,
this
seems
to
be
uncommonly
colloquial
in
illuminating
the
charge.
both
charges
seemed
to
me
not
very
guiding,
as
i
read
them.
whereas
this
uses
more
words
than
i
should
use,
i
hope,
but
it
--
it
does
more
than
just
give
the
generality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
was
the
mirror
--
is
--
is
that
before
a
mirror?
is
that
--
is
that
relevant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
transaction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
all
right.
no,
no,
but
i
just
wondered
because
you
said
in
front
of
a
mirror.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
government's
position
--
this
--
i'm
not
now
saying
it
should
be
sustained,
but
is
this
the
government's
position
that
the
statute
practically
draws,
once
possession
is
proved,
the
burden
of
--
of
explaining
away
any
of
the
alternative
condemnations
of
the
statute
upon
the
defendant?
the
statute
does
so
and
this
court
in
several
cases
has
sustained
that
presumption.
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
show
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
all
there's
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
indeed,
the
(inaudible)
of
that
penalization
by
congress
because
they
use
that
method,
they
thought
that
was
a
way
of
--
of
discouraging
these
people.
they
use
the
physical
power
as
a
means
of
--
of
penalizing
conduct
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
where
they
have
to
sustain
in
the
cases,
justice
felix
frankfurter
otherwise,
it's
a
state
offense.
otherwise
it
might
be
just,
otherwise
(voice
overlap)
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
commerce,
has
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there's
no
stamp,
if
it
wasn't
for
the
physical
aspect
under
which
this
court
sustained
that
legislation,
it
would
be
a
local
offense
and
not
a
federal
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
the
stamp
business
is
of
the
essence
of
the
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
possession
of
heroin
in
and
of
itself
a
federal
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says
john
jones
in
new
york
or
city
of
binghamton
in
new
york
was
arrested
for
possessing
heroin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
how
can
--
what
--
what
is
the
basis,
what
is
the
constitutional
justification
for
a
law
by
congress
that
the
possession
of
a
drug
for
which
no
physical
responsibility,
which
involve
no
physical
responsibility
of
a
crime?
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
it
be
a
--
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
if
it's
imported,
if
there's
a
presumption
that
if
you've
got
a
drug
which
only
could
be
imported,
i
can
understand
that,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
therefore
--
therefore,
there's
a
presumption
that
if
you're
possessing
it,
it
--
it
was
imported.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
it
was
imported,
it
comes
under
the
foreign
commerce
provision
of
the
constitution.
and
all
the
stamp
in
regard
to
heroin
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
that
doesn't
apply,
if
there's
no
revenue
power
exerted
against
heroin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
and
if
congress
acts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
gets
a
lot
of
money
or
gets
some
money
out
of
--
from
illegal
sources.
i
suppose
the
secretary
of
treasury
has
no
conscience
qualms
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
--
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
there
isn't
--
isn't
a
fastidiously
accurate
way
of
saying
that
if
nothing
more
is
in
the
case,
the
jury
can
convict,
that
it
throws
the
burden
of
disproof
if
--
upon
the
defendant
and
therefore
it
may
raise
a
large
question
which
presumably
the
cases
that
we've
decided
at
face,
namely,
that
this
is
either
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
or
the
implication
of
other
aspects
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
regard
to
presumption
of
innocence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
that
it?
that's
a
big
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
that's
the
real
thing,
that
the
body
of
legislation,
the
decision
thus
far
has
held
that
if
you
have
possession,
the
nature
of
this
animal
is
such
that
it
is
not
violative
of
due
process
or
a
bad
trial,
or
of
rational
connection
to
have
the
defendant
explain
it.
that's
essence
of
the
business,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could.
he
might
just
be
somebody
--
of
--
the
case
would
arise,
if
he
said,
some
of
--
somebody
must
have
put
this
into
my
pocket,
this
is
a
plan,
this
is
a
perilous
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
not
a
knowledgeable
act,
but
it's
a
perilous
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
between
a
non
knowledgeable
act
and
perilous
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
held
the
contrary
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
might
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
dotterweich
case.
that's
balint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
mean
he
put
--
it
--
it
treats
these
cases
practically,
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
this?
it
treats
these
cases.
it
puts
them
to
one
side
as
an
exception.
there's
a
rule
laid
down
in
the
morissette
case
which
would
be
the
common
law
and
--
and
i
hope
they
accept
the
due
process
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
the
whole
argument
in
balint,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
whole
argument
in
devine
is
otherwise,
even
though
it
didn't
say
it,
the
usual
presumption
of
mens
rea
applied,
and
all
those
cases
go
the
other
way,
so
that
the
real
issue
is
this
big
issue
which
i
try
to
say,
isn't
that
true?
