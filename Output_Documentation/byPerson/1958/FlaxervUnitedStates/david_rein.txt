mr.
david
rein
may
it
please
of
court.
this
case
is
here
to
review
a
conviction
for
contempt
for
refusing
to
produce
certain
records
before
the
subcommittee
on
internal
security
of
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary.
the
time
of
the
incidence
which
led
to
the
indictment
on
this
case,
the
petitioner,
abram
flaxer,
who
was
national
president
of
the
national
labor
union,
the
united
public
workers
of
america,
this
union
organized
members
and
various
continental
agencies,
federal,
state,
county,
and
municipal
governments.
in
1951,
about
which
is
the
time
at
which
the
subpoena
was
served
upon
him
which
led
to
this
case.
this
union
had
approximately
35,000
members.
on
this
number,
only
about
5%
were
employed
in
the
federal
government
mostly
in
the
bureau
of
engraving
and
the
post
office
department
and
of
the
records
administration.
the
remaining
members
of
the
union
were
employed
in
state
governments,
county
governments,
and
municipal
governments
throughout
the
country.
on
september
19th,
1951,
petitioner
was
served
with
subpoena
duces
tecum
from
the
subcommittee
on
internal
security
of
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary.
this
subpoena
called
to
the
production
of
the
union's
records
including
certain
financial
data
of
the
union.
and
of
the
issue
which
is
raised
by
the
indictment
in
this
case,
also
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
of
the
union
members
employed
by
the
federal
government
and
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
union
members
employed
by
state,
county,
or
municipal
governments.
the
subpoena
bought
a
signature
of
senator
mccarran,
he
was
at
that
time
chairman
of
the
subcommittee.
the
subpoena
contained
no
information
as
to
the
subject
under
inquiry
or
the
reason
why
the
subcommittee
was
interested
the
information.it
appears
from
the
record
that
the
subpoena
had
been
prepared
by
members
of
the
staff
and
the
subcommittee
and
apparently
without
any
formal
advance
approval
or
authorization
by
the
subcommittee
itself.
petitioner
appeared
in
response
to
this
subpoena
before
the
subcommittee
on
october
5th,
1951.
only
one
member
of
the
subcommittee
was
present
at
the
time,
senator
watkins.
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing,
petitioner
preceded
--
objected
the
proceeding
in
the
absence
of
a
quorum,
stating
that
he
did
not
believe
that
a
single
senator
constituted
a
quorum.
senator
watkins
overruled
this
objection
saying
that
under
the
rules
of
the
senate
and
of
the
subcommittee,
he
did
constitute
a
quorum
for
all
purposes.
at
this
hearing,
petitioner
produced
as
demanded
by
the
subpoena,
the
union
records
would
show
the
amount,
the
source,
and
placement
deposit
of
the
union's
funds,
and
also
organizations
to
which
the
union
has
contributed
during
the
past
12
months.
he
was
asked
and
he
answered
various
questions
concerning
the
method
of
operation
of
the
union
and
the
number
of
distribution
of
its
members
among
various
governmental
agencies.
he
brought
however,
producing
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
union's
members.
he
argued,
and
i
like
to
turn
now
to
page
7
of
our
brief
in
which
we
quote
from
the
record
in
which
he
stated
his
position
as
to
why
he
did
not
wish
to
produce
all
the
list
--
the
membership
list
of
the
union.
he
said
that
this
demand
invaded
the
right
of
the
union
to
the
privacy
of
its
membership
records.
and
the
experience
of
this
country
had
taught
that
invasions
of
this
privacy
were
served
to
--
to
compile
blacklists
for
the
sole
purpose
of
destroying
unions.
and
he
said,
and
i'm
quoting
now,
"every
individual
who
joins
the
union,
joins
it
with
the
confidence
and
trust
supported
by
tradition
and
law
that
the
act
of
joining
and
maintaining
membership
is
a
personal
right
and
freedom
that
isn't
violative."
a
request
such
as
the
present
constitutes
a
wholesale
invasion
of
such
privacy,
and
the
right
to
be
let
alone
which
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
every
trade
union
member
imposes
a
special
trust
in
these
union
offices
to
protect
and
preserve
that
right.
therefore,
to
submit
to
the
request
in
this
subpoena
would
be
a
violation
of
the
trust
imposed
in
me
by
my
membership
and
the
betrayal
of
the
entire
trade
union
movement
in
this
country.
i
have
no
doubt
that
not
a
single
union
president
which
find
it
possible
to
comply
with
such
a
request.
he
said,
"i'm
confident
that
the
members
of
this
committee,
after
considering
my
views
and
after
studying
the
full
implications
of
their
request
made
in
this
subpoena
realized
its
conflict
with
the
basic
union
traditions
of
this
country
now
incorporated
to
federal
law
and
withdraw
the
demand
for
membership
lists."
he
added
at
the
time
that
he
did
not
have
--
he
had
not
compiled
in
advance
this
list
of
union
members
because
he
considered
the
demand
to
be
an
improper
one.
senator
watkins
directed
him
to
produce
the
membership
list.
nevertheless,
at
this
point,
petitioner
asked
for
reconsideration
of
this
request,
arguing
that
the
demand
for
the
list
was
in
violation
of
a
national
policy
against
an
employer
asking
the
names
of
the
union
members.
senator
watkins
replied
that
there
was
no
law
holding
that
the
united
states
itself
could
not
find
out
the
names
of
members
in
its
employees
who
belonged
to
a
union.
counsel
for
the
committee,
mr.
arens
then
asked
petitioner,
"how
long
it
would
take
him
to
compile
this
information?"
petitioner
replied
that
he
probably
could
compile
it
in
about
a
week.
although
he
did
not
have
a
membership
list
of
the
kind
called
for
in
the
subpoena,
the
information
was
available
to
him
for
that
purpose.
senator
watkins
thereupon
ordered
the
petitioner
to
produce
the
information
within
10
days
from
the
date
of
the
hearing.
that
is
october
5th.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
october
5th
which
was
the
first
time
he
got
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
committee
which
was
the
date
in
which
he
was
asked
to
appear.
mr.
david
rein
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
that's
one
of
the
points
we
argue
in
our
--
in
our
brief
later.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
it
is,
yes,
very
definitely.
petitioner
again
objected
--
mr.
david
rein
i
--
mr.
david
rein
the
informative
in
this
case?
mr.
david
rein
well,
there
is
no
infirmity
in
that.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
there
is
no
infirmity
in
that.
the
only
issue
--
mr.
david
rein
the
only
issue
was
that
the
petitioner
is
not
guilty
of
contempt
on
that
day.
that's
the
only
point
we
make
about
it.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
david
rein
well
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
david
rein
he
didn't
say
he
was
not
going
to
produce
it.
mr.
david
rein
well,
the
mere
fact
that
there's
an
extension
raises
other
issues
--
mr.
david
rein
--
but
it
makes
us
clear
--
it
makes
it
clear
that
he's
not
guilty
of
contempt
on
that
particular
date.
mr.
david
rein
well
that's
true,
but
i
would
get
to
that.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i'll
get
to
that
point
in
my
argument.
mr.
david
rein
it's
just
one
of
--
mr.
david
rein
i
may
say
--
mr.
david
rein
i
may
say
it's
one
of
my
many
points
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
a
good
point
but
it's
certainly
not
our
principal
point.
petitioner
again
objected
and
he
asked
the
committee
to
reconsider
this
request.
he
said
at
that
time,
"that
i
don't
think
that
these
lists
can
be
looked
upon
in
any
other
like
than
as
blacklists."
the
senator
replied
to
the
petitioner
at
that
time
that
this
was
an
executive
session
of
the
subcommittee
and
that
the
records
were
not
necessarily
be
made
public,
to
which
the
petitioner
replied,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
9
of
the
brief.
"so,
on
that
i
don't
see
any
good
purpose
that
these
records
would
serve
even
if
i
were
to
produce
them.
i
think
that
they
are
wholly
irrelevant
if
you
say
they
are
not
to
be
made
public."
senator
watkins
said
that
he
was
not
promising
that
they
would
not
be
made
public
because
he
did
not
think
that
the
government
had
to
make
such
a
promise
to
get
the
information.
mr.
flaxer
then
said,
"i
think
with
all
due
respect
to
the
committee
you
are
infringing
here
on
an
area
which
just
crosses
the
boundaries
of
individual
rights
as
well
as
trade
union
rights
far
beyond
the
contemplation
of
any."
he
was
cut
off
in
the
middle
of
that
objection
by
senator
watkins'
statements
that
whatever
your
argument
is
that
is
the
order
now.
a
colloquy
ended
with
senator
watkins
stating
to
the
petitioner
that
he
was
ordered
to
produce
the
records
within
10
days.
the
petitioner
stating
that
he
would
take
that
request
under
advisement.
at
no
time
during
this
hearing
did
the
subcommittee
state
what
was
the
subject
of
the
inquiry,
the
purpose
for
which
the
subpoenaed
membership
list
was
desired,
for
what
use
whether
it
could
be
made
of
the
list
by
the
subcommittee.
what
i
have
read
to
you
here
is
the
complete
transaction
which
is
relevant
to
the
demand
of
the
subcommittee.
at
the
trial,
the
government
introduced
in
evidence
only
two
things.
one,
or
--
well,
i
should
say,
they
introduced
the
subpoena,
they
introduced
the
transcript
of
what
occurred
at
the
subcommittee
hearing,
which
was
succinctly
as
i
have
put
it
to
you,
and
also
they
put
on
the
stand
just
one
witness.
that
was
mr.
richard
arens,
counsel
for
the
subcommittee,
who
was
put
on
the
stand
to
testify
as
to
what
the
pertinence
of
--
of
this
particular
demand
was.
mr.
arens
testified
that
the
subcommittee
had
information
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
union
secretary
treasurer,
a
former
negotiation's
director
and
"certain
members
of
its
executive
board"
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
in
that
connection
i'd
like
to
indicate
what
the
government's
position
seemed
to
be
in
that
respect.
we
objected
to
that
type
of
testimony
on
the
ground
that
it
was
hearsay.
the
government
said,
and
i'd
like
to
quote
here
for
mr.
hitz's
statement.
we
are
not
trying
to
prove
he
was
a
communist
--
mr.
david
rein
page
52
of
the
record,
in
the
transcript
to
the
record.
we
are
not
trying
to
prove
he
was
a
communist.
we
are
trying
to
prove
that
the
committee
thought
he
was
and
that
is
enough
to
get
him
before
the
committee
and
his
records.
i
assume
that
referring
to
his
records
in
this
connection,
mr.
hitz's
man,
not
the
petitioner's
records,
but
the
records
of
the
union.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
at
the
very
top
of
the
page
52
--
mr.
david
rein
--
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
that
statement
of
mr.
hitz.
mr.
arens
was
the
only
witness.
neither
he
nor
any
other
witness
gave
any
testimony
as
to
what
was
the
subject
and
their
inquiry,
or
the
pertinency
of
the
union's
membership
list
to
any
subject.
nor
there
is
any
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
why
the
subcommittee
wished
the
names
and
addresses
of
these
35,000
union
members
or
what
use
it
intended
to
make
of
that
information.
the
trial
court
ruled
--
denied
our
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
it
ruled
over
our
objection
that
the
records
were
pertinent
to
some
subject
under
inquiry
though
it
never
bothered
to
state
what
that
subject
was.
it
also
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
quorum
had
been
present.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
both
counts
of
the
indictment.
i
should
indicate
that
although
there
was
only
one
subpoena
here,
the
indictments
set
the
refusal
to
produce
in
two
separate
counts.
one
count
covering
the
refusal
to
produce
the
names
and
address
of
the
members
of
the
union
employed
by
the
federal
government,
the
second
count,
alleging
a
failure
to
produce
the
names
and
addresses
of
members
of
the
union
employed
by
state,
county
and,
municipal
governments
throughout
the
united
states.
this
appeal
was
first
heard
before
a
three-judge
panel
below
or
before
the
decision
was
rendered,
it
was
heard
en
banc.
i
think
it's
important
to
turn
to
that
first
decision
of
the
court
to
indicate
its
theory
as
to
why
these
records
were
pertinent.
it's
the
only
place
where
any
theory
was
expounded
anywhere
here,
and
as
i
gather
from
the
government's
brief,
and
apparently
it's
the
nature
of
--
of
the
government's
theory.
and
i
turn
now
to
page
104
of
the
record
where
the
majority
opinion
on
the
first
opinion
was
written
by
judge
wilbur
miller.
and
he
said
it
was
because
of
--
now,
i'm
reading
now
from
the
top
of
the
page
104.
it
was
because
of
congressional
alarm
reflected
on
that
act,
i'm
referring
to
the
subversive
activities
control
act
of
1950,
and
other
recent
legislation
that
the
subcommittee
was
authorized
to
study
and
investigate
the
extent,
nature,
and
effects
of
subversive
activities,
including
the
infiltration
of
labor
organizations
by
persons
who
are
or
may
be
under
communist
domination.
against
such
a
background,
the
pertinency
of
the
membership
list
demanded
by
the
subpoena
is
at
once
apparent.
he
then
said,
"the
names
could
be
used
to
check
against
a
list
of
subversives
to
determine
the
extent
of
infiltration
into
the
union,
a
matter
clearly
pertinent
under
the
resolution
particularly
since
this
is
a
government
employees'
union
even
though
the
names
of
state
and
local
members
are
included,
regardless
of
where
they
were
employed,
the
names
of
members
were
pertinent
because
an
investigation
of
the
union
was
pertinent.
we
brought
this
case
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari.
this
court
without
hearing
argument
vacated
the
judgment
below
and
sent
the
case
back
to
the
court
below
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
watkins
against
united
states.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
again
hearing
the
case
en
banc
affirmed,
again
affirmed
the
conviction.
in
its
opinion,
it
did
not
indicate
whether
it
endorsed
the
views
originally
expressed
by
the
court
in
its
original
opinion.
it
was
entirely
silent
on
that
subject.
although
one
of
the
principles
we
believe
in
watkins
was
the
important
principle
as
indicated
here
in
the
arguments
yesterday
of
balancing
invasions
against
the
bill
of
rights
against
what
might
appear
to
be
a
justification
of
the
government
for
the
information.
the
court
gave
no
consideration
to
that
problem
at
all.
he
considered
only
one
question,
and
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
had
been
informed
of
the
pertinency
of
the
demand.
it
came
to
the
conclusion
to
which
i
will
later
address
myself
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
inform
him
because
the
petitioner
already
knew
what
the
--
what
the
pertinency
was.
we
contend
here
that
there
are
at
least
six
separate
grounds
upon
which
a
judgment
of
acquittal
should
have
been
entered
in
this
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
i
will
have
time
to
cover
all
of
those
grounds
in
my
argument.
i
would
like
just
briefly
to
state
what
our
position
is
with
regard
to
all
of
those
grounds.
we
state
first
that
the
judgement
below
is
erroneous
because
there
is
no
proof
anywhere
in
this
record
as
to
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was,
as
to
what
the
pertinency
of
the
particular
demand
was
to
any
subject
under
inquiry,
and
there
is
no
showing
of
any
legitimate
or
legislative
purpose.
we
contend
also
that
under
the
doctrine
of
watkins,
one
is
to
balance,
so
gross
an
invasion
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
it's
present
here
against
an
asserted
government
purpose
there
is
nothing
to
balance.
we
have
only
here
a
gross
invasion.we
have
nothing
on
the
other
side.
we
contend
thirdly
that
petitioner
was
not
informed
as
required
under
watkins
of
the
pertinency
of
the
demand.
we
contend
also
that
the
resolution
strictly
as
applied
here
was
too
vague
to
furnish
us
an
authorization
for
compulsory
process.
we
contend
also
that
the
single
senator
present
was
not
under
the
rules
of
the
senate
and
under
the
rules
of
the
subcommittee
itself,
a
quorum
of
authority
to
rule
upon
petitioner's
objections.
and
we
contend
finally
that
in
any
event,
there
was
clearly
no
contempt
on
october
5th
which
was
the
date
set
forth
in
the
indictment.
mr.
david
rein
they
must
find
a
contempt
on
october
5th
that
it
should
not
consider.
both
sides
agreed
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
any
contempt
at
any
other
time
was
not
in
the
case.
that
only
issue
before
the
jury,
the
only
issue
raised
by
the
indictment,
the
only
thing
tried
in
this
case
is
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
contempt
on
october
5th.
i
think
there's
no
--
no
issue
was
ever
raised
about
that.
we
asked
for
instructions.
to
that
effect,
the
government
agreed
to
it
and
other
courts
on
charge.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
perfectly
correct
if
there
were
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
that
that's
--
i
think
that
i
have
a
number
of
arguments
here.
some
of
them
are
not
very
far-reaching
but
i
think
it's
important
for
me
to
present
to
this
court
at
this
time
all
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
--
mr.
david
rein
--
of
the
petitioner's
regard
in
this
case.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i'm
confident
of
all
of
these
points
and
of
that
as
well
as
there'd
be
others.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
rein
no,
i'm
going
to
start
with
a
small
point,
[laughs]
a
relatively
small
point.
i'm
going
to
stop
with
the
point
that
the
prosecution
here,
that
the
conviction
here
must
be
reversed
because
of
the
failure
of
proof
of
the
subject
of
inquiry,
the
failure
of
proof
of
pertinency
and
the
failure
of
the
government
to
prove
any
legitimate
legislative
purposes.
mr.
david
rein
well,
not
necessarily.
mr.
david
rein
no,
not
necessarily
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
but
we
do
not
even
need
to
reach
a
constitutional
question
because
the
statute
involved
here,
2
u.s.c.
192,
says
that
a
witness
is
not
guilty
of
contempt
unless
he
refuses
to
answer
a
question
which
is
pertinent
to
a
subject
under
inquiry.
this
court
has
held
in
sinclair
and
in
other
--
in
other
cases
purely
as
a
statutory
matter
although
you
can
also
do
it
for
constitutional
reasons
but
purely
as
a
statutory
matter
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
and
all
of
these
cases
to
prove
pertinence,
to
get
it
within
the
meaning
of
2
u.s.c.
192.
so
although
it
has
constitutional
overtones,
it
can
be
decided
purely
on
that
statutory
ground,
and
there's
a
statutory
requirement
approved
for
pertinency.
mr.
david
rein
i
will
--
sir,
i
would
say
on
that,
your
honor,
if
i
may
perhaps
--
well,
i'll
take
no
art
of
order
and
address
myself
briefly
to
that.
i
think
that
that
point
is
covered
absolutely
adequately
for
my
purposes
while
the
dissenting
opinion
written
by
judge
edgerton
in
the
original
opinion
in
this
case
in
which
he
pointed
out
quite
clearly
the
fact
that
the
way
this
colloquy
ended,
there
was
no
obligation
upon
the
petitioner
to
produce
anything
on
october
5th.
that
he
was
ordered
to
produce
it
10
days
later.
now,
the
majority
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry.
the
majority
of
the
court
disagreed
and
this
was
its
reasoning
and
i
can
state
it
very
briefly,
that
it
did
not
matter
what
happened
toward
the
end
of
the
discussion,
that
what
was
important
was
the
fact
that
somewhere
during
the
colloquy
and
it
is
true,
he
was
ordered
to
produce
in
accordance
with
the
language
of
the
subpoena.
that
therefore,
he
was
guilty
of
contempt
in
all
of
the
other
discussion,
the
argument
that
went
back
and
forth
did
not
matter.
i'd
like
to
indicate,
your
honor,
purely
as
a
technical
matter
that
the
petitioner
really
was
under
no
obligation
to
produce
this
membership
list
within
the
terms
of
the
subpoena
because
as
i
understand
it,
he
is
only
required
to
produce
things
which
are
in
his
possession.
he
had
no
such
membership
list
in
his
possession.
he
would've
had
to
compile
such
a
membership
list
in
the
first
place.
and
it
was
only
reasonable,
it
seems
to
me,
for
him
to
come
to
the
committee
at
the
first
time
he
had
an
opportunity
to
come
to
the
committee
to
make
his
arguments
before
going
to
what
would
have
been
considerably
expensive
trouble
of
compiling
the
list
which
was
not
in
his
possession.
mr.
david
rein
no.
he
didn't
resist
the
subpoena
on
that
ground
but
he
did
not
actually
go
to
the
trouble
of
compiling
the
list
until
he
had
an
opportunity
to
present
his
argument.
mr.
david
rein
i
assume
there
was.
yes.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
there
was.
he
was
served
on
september
19th.
he
appeared
october
5th.
he
said
he
could've
put
--
mr.
david
rein
he
said
--
he
said
he
could
have
prepared
it
within
a
week.
there
would've
been
time
to
him
to
prepare
it
and
he
makes
no
issue
that
he
did
not
have
it
then,
necessary
time.
i
make
only
the
point
that
this
was
the
first
opportunity
he
had
to
protest
or
to
the
propriety
of
the
demand.
and
i
may
say
that
there
is
no
indication
here
that
there
was
anything
of
time
was
in
anyway
of
essence
to
the
committee
that
it
had
to
be
produce
on
--
there
was
anything
magic
about
october
5th.
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
failure
of
proof
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
i
think
the
record
bears
this
out
that
the
prosecution
did
not
prove
either
the
subject
under
inquiry,
the
pertinency
of
the
membership
list,
or
any
legislative
purpose.
there
is
nothing
in
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
here
which
would
give
any
indication
of
any
of
these
elements.
and
certainly
one
cannot
find
it
in
the
vague
language
of
the
resolution
itself.
at
the
trial
all
we
have
in
addition
to
the
transcript
was
the
testimony
of
counsel
for
the
subcommittee,
that
the
committee
had
certain
information
that
certain
officers
of
the
union,
including
the
petitioner,
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
and
that's
all
there
is.
by
itself,
this
does
not
demonstrate
either
a
subject
under
inquiry
or
that
the
inquiry
has
a
legislative
purpose.
and
more
important,
it
certainly
shows
no
rational
basis,
certainly
no
legitimate
basis
for
the
demand
for
a
list
of
35,000
members
of
the
union.
the
court
below
and
the
government
here
contend
that
the
subject
under
inquiry,
their
language,
was
whether
or
not
there
was
communist
party
infiltration
into
the
union.
we
say
that
there
was
a
number
of
difficulties
with
this
contention.
first,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it.
the
government
concedes
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
no
one
ever
said
that.
if
there
is
however,
that
one
can
gather
that
that
was
the
subject
under
inquiry
from
the
entire
tenor
of
the
proceeding,
we
would
say
first,
that
certainly
one
cannot
gather
a
subject
under
inquiry
or
pertinency
with
the
undisputable
clarity
that
is
required
in
contempt
cases
as
indicated
by
this
court
in
zacher
against
the
united
states
from
the
entire
tenor
of
a
proceeding
particularly
since
the
government,
although
it
refers
to
entire
tenor,
it
can
appoint
to
no
statement
made
either
by
senator
watkins
or
by
counsel
for
the
subcommittee.
in
addition,
we
say,
even
if
you
examine
this
tenor
from
beginning
to
end
and
all
the
way
through,
you
cannot
find
that
subject
under
inquiry.
what
is
the
tenor
of
the
proceeding?
the
tenor
of
the
proceeding
is
that
the
petitioner
was
asked
certain
neutral
questions
about
the
method
of
operation
of
the
union,
the
number
of
its
members,
the
distribution
of
these
members.
all
of
which
questions
he
answered.
the
only
thing
that
you
can
gather
from
the
tenor
of
this
proceeding
was
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
repeatedly
and
consistently
complained
and
objected
that
the
sole
purpose
of
this
demand
was
to
employ
the
list
for
blacklisting
purposes.
that
charge,
it
has,
was
never
reputed
or
denied
by
senator
watkins.
the
only
other
thing
that
we
have
here
is
a
statement
by
senator
watkins
during
the
course
of
the
colloquy.
that
there
was
no
reason
why
the
government
was
not
entitled
to
know
which
of
its
employees
belong
to
a
union.
now
we
have
here
a
situation
where
senator
watkins
with
the
subcommittee
of
one,
of
a
subcommittee
of
a
full
--
of
a
subcommittee
of
seven,
of
a
committee
of
the
senate
of
one
house
of
our
national
legislature.
now,
i
think
for
the
senate
there
to
equate
himself
with
the
government
of
the
united
states,
and
to
say
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
a
right
to
know
which
of
its
employees
belong
to
a
union
hardly
indicates
that
the
subcommittee
necessarily
had
that
right
or
that
the
subcommittee
had
a
legitimate
subject
under
inquiry
even
assuming
that
the
government
had
such
a
right.
mr.
david
rein
well,
no.
not
unless
it
served
a
legislative
purpose.
this
subcommittee
--
mr.
david
rein
this
subcommittee
has
not
the
right
to
demand
a
list
of
union
members
on
the
abstract
proposition
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
this
right.
this
subcommittee
can
demand
it
only
if
it
within
the
jurisdiction
conferred
upon
it
by
a
valid
clear
senate
of
resolution
--
mr.
david
rein
--
that
fall
within
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
rein
well,
presumably
they
could
pass
an
act,
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress
and
signed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
if
they
were
interested
in
it.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
know
what
information.
the
information
have
to
relate
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
my
point
is,
senator
watkins'
statement
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
know
does
not
advance
the
government's
case
that
there
was
a
legitimate
subject
of
inquiry
before
this
committee.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
he
did
because
he
was
asserting
that
the
government
had
a
right,
that
of
meeting
an
issue,
which
is
that
this
particular
subcommittee
had
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
within
the
jurisdiction
confined
to
in
the
subcommittee.
i
think
he
did
err
in
equating
himself
with
the
government
because
he
did
not
have
all
of
the
jurisdiction
possessed
by
the
government
in
all
its
parties.
even
if
one
assumes
that
this
was
a
subject
of
inquiry,
this
does
not,
it
seems
to
me,
advance
the
government's
problem.
because
the
question
still
remains,
the
important
question
in
this
case
is,
what
is
the
pertinency
of
the
list
of
35,000
members
of
the
union
to
even
that
subject
under
inquiry?
now,
to
plug
this
gap,
the
court
below
in
its
original
opinion
and
the
government
here
employed
another
improvisation.
and
that
is
that
the
names
of
the
union
members
could
be
check
against
a
list
of
subversives.
now
again,
we
run
into
a
number
of
difficulties.
first,
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
this
subcommittee
had
a
list
of
subversives.
and,
i
would
submit
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
proper
function
for
any
legislative
subcommittee
to
compile
and
maintain
such
a
list.
i
would
also
say
and
i
think
this
court
can
clearly
take
notice
that
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
1951
at
the
time
when
the
loyalty
program
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
been
in
full
force
in
effect
for
a
number
of
years
that
there
were
going
to
be
any
government
employees
on
any
list
of
subversives.
they
obviously
would
no
longer
be
in
the
government.
we
contended
that
it's
improper
even
to
make
this
assumption
by
the
court
below
for
a
legislative
subcommittee
to
be
in
the
business
of
compiling
the
lists
of
subversives.
and,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
i
cannot
see
that
it
would
be
a
proper
function
of
any
government
agency
to
compile
such
a
list.
the
government
in
this
brief
replies,
i
like
to
turn
to
brief
53
as
to
how
they
made
that
contention,
and
this
is
the
government's
brief.
it
says
and
i'm
reading
now
from
the
middle
of
the
page.
nor
was
it
necessary
for
the
committee
to
have
had
a
master
list
of
subversives
for
the
union
membership
list
to
have
been
useful
to
the
committee
in
its
inquiry.
the
court
below
said
nothing
about
any
such
master
list,
so
termed
as
petitioners.
but
the
committee
certainly
had
in
its
files
as
a
result
of
its
prior
investigations,
names
of
persons
who
there
were
at
least
grounds
for
believing
war
members
of
the
communist
party.
i
submit
that
this
does
not
show
that
the
purpose
is
anymore
legitimate.
it
merely
shows
that
a
list
is
not
a
comprehensive
or
good
list
or
a
master
list.
it
merely
shows
that
it
would
not
have
been
very
useful
even
for
this
illegitimate
purpose.
finally,
we
come
to
the
problem
of
legislative
purpose.
hereto,
the
record
is
completely
bare.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
that
is
in
both
opinions
didn't
really
consider
the
question.
indeed,
if
you
read
those
opinions,
it
would
seem
to
have
adopted
a
view
which
was
directly
repudiated
by
this
court
in
watkins
that
the
inquiry
was
an
end
in
itself,
but
merely
that
fact
that
--
and
perhaps,
i
think
they
adopted
a
view
which
we
--
will
be
put
by
the
quotation
i
read
from
mr.
hitz.
that
once
they
had
information
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
they
had
a
right
to
demand
the
records
of
the
union
and
one
may
not
go
beyond
that.
in
other
words,
the
inquiry
serves
its
all
purpose.
it
need
not
have
a
legislative
purpose.
the
government
here
on
appeal,
and
i
think
for
the
first
time
in
the
supreme
court
--
well
i
think
it
did
raise
it
earlier
in
--
it's
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
comes
forth
with
a
number
of
hypothetical
suggestions
as
to
what
conceivably
might
have
been
of
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
committee.
we
have
treated
that
in
our
reply
brief.
i
do
not
think
i
have
the
time
to
go
into
them
in
full
detail
here
except
to
say
this.
one,
they
are
afterthoughts.
two,
they
are
hypothetical
suppositions
as
to
what
the
committee
might
have
had
in
mind.
they
are
clearly
farfetched
and
fanciful.
and
most
importantly,
in
no
case
does
the
government
establish
a
nexus
between
a
list
of
35,000
union
members
in
any
of
these
purported
legislative
purposes.
i
want
to
comment
just
briefly
on
one
suggested
legislative
purpose.
it
appears
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
42.
and
that
is
that
the
subcommittee
here
might
have
been
interested
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
union
was
a
communist
front
organization
as
defined
by
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
we
would
contend
that
if
that
had
been
the
purpose
of
the
committee,
it
would
have
form
squarely
upward
of
the
language
of
this
court
both
in
quinn
and
in
watkins
that
legislative
committees
are
not
law
enforcement
agencies,
nor
trial
agencies.
the
function
of
determining
whether
any
organization
is
a
communist
front
organization
is
committed
by
the
internal
security
act
to
the
subversive
activities
controller
--
subversive
activities
control
board
subject
to
judicial
review.
it
cannot
be
determined
by
the
kind
of
ex
parte
investigation
that
was
conducted
by
the
subcommittee
here.
mr.
david
rein
sure.
mr.
david
rein
well,
it
didn't
--
it
was
not
to
its
breadth
in
terms
of
work.
it
was
--
into
its
breadth
in
terms
of
being
a
sweeping
wholesale
invasion
of
privacy
without
any
justification.
mr.
david
rein
well,
except
that
it
gets
aggravated
in
terms
of
what
legitimate
purpose
can
a
committee
have
as
the
group
gets
larger
and
larger.
mr.
david
rein
well,
they
argued
that
it
was
abusive
in
asking
for
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
members
of
this
union,
yes.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
see
a
distinction
between
the
two.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
question
to
the
abstract.
i
agree
with
you
--
mr.
david
rein
surely.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
couldn't.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
and
i
think
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
not
presenting
that
--
that
view
at
all.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry
i
don't
recall
using
any
such
phrase.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
would
say
whether
the
watkins
case
bars
congress
from
doing
it
as
i
read
it,
the
problem
presented
by
this
court
by
the
type
of
resolution
that
you
had
for
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
then
i
don't
think
we
necessarily
have
a
problem
then
we
would
have
to
discuss
each
particular
case
to
see
whether
or
not
the
request
is
pertinent
to
a
--
mr.
david
rein
--
a
definite
subject
under
inquiry.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
it
would
be
an
explicit
purpose.
you
still
have
the
question
as
to
whether
what
questions
they
were
asking
particular
people
had
any
bearing
on
that
side.
mr.
david
rein
surely.
mr.
david
rein
i
would
think
yes.
mr.
david
rein
well,
you
don't
have
to
have
35,000
names
--
mr.
david
rein
--
of
the
people
who
aren't
reputed
even
to
be
subversives.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
find
it
hard
--
mr.
david
rein
i
find
it
--
mr.
david
rein
i
find
it
hard
to
discuss
this
question
in
the
abstract.
mr.
david
rein
it
might
have
--
no,
i'm
not.
i
have,
not
here.
mr.
david
rein
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
david
rein
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
david
rein
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
david
rein
let
me
put
it
this
way
and
i
will
say
this,
that
assuming
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
which
i
do
not
take
it's
the
function
of
this
court
to
assume
and
to
supply
to
a
subcommittee
which
hasn't
presented
any
evidence
as
to
what
it
was
doing,
but
committees
having
a
legislative
purpose
can
only
look
into
subjects
generally.
and
i
don't
see
--
and
i
would
go
this
far,
i
can
never
see
any
purpose
under
which
having
the
names
and
addresses
of
35,000
members
of
a
union
can
possibly
further
any
legitimate
legislative
purpose
the
fact
of
getting
names
and
addresses
in
itself
is
an
indication
that
you're
not
thinking
in
legislative
terms.
and
i
would
make
that
as
my
proposition.
mr.
david
rein
let
me
say
that
if
your
imagination
was
equal
to
it,
it's
not
your
function
here
to
extend
it.
it's
the
function
of
the
government
in
the
trial
or
the
subcommittee
to
make
some
showing
of
how
this
would
have
assisted
it.
mr.
david
rein
it's
hard
to
make.
my
imagination,
i
would
say,
does
not
extend
as
far
as
your
honors.
i
do
not
prescribe
it.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
can
think
of
no
circumstances
--
mr.
david
rein
--
now
where
it
might
be.
well,
that's
about
to
--
mr.
david
rein
--
where
i'll
have
to
label.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
do
that.
i
want
to
go
briefly
to
the
doctrine
advanced
by
this
court
in
watkins
and
more
recently
in
naacp
against
alabama.
there,
the
doctrine
was
set
down
that
wherever
there
is
a
gross
invasion
or
any
invasion
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
and
here
you
have
a
gross
invasion,
there
must
be
a
balance
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
governmental
purpose
justifies
of
that
invasion.
i
would
say
in
this
case,
we
have
nothing
to
balance
on
the
other
side,
and
secondly,
there
is
no
more
reason
to
permit
the
demand
of
these
names
than
there
was
in
the
naacp
case.
there
is
no
more
relationship
between
the
demands
of
35,000
union
members
and
any
alleged
purpose
of
the
committee
shown
here
in
this
record
than
there
was
in
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
because
we
still
don't
know
why
they
wanted
it
and
it
still
appears
here.
and
i
like
to
address
myself
however,
to
that
question
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
difference,
and
that
really
was
my
next
point.
at
the
invalidity
of
the
subpoena
was
aggravated
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
the
bulk
of
the
names
it
asked
for
were
those
of
state,
county,
and
municipal
employees.
i
like
to
first
bring
to
the
court's
attention
its
own
doctrine
as
set
forth
in
the
bowman
dairy
case.
that
whenever
a
subpoena,
a
single
subpoena
covers
matters
which
are
good
and
bad,
one
is
not
in
contempt
that
one
refuses
to
violate
that
subpoena
because
the
language
used
is
that
the
one
who
had
subpoenaed
the
witness
is
not
required
to
call
the
good
from
the
bad.
therefore,
if
this
court
holds
that
it
was
invalid
and
improper
to
demand
the
names
of
the
employees,
not
employed
by
the
federal
government,
and
the
entire
subpoena
must
fall
in
both
counts
of
the
indictment
must
fall.
mr.
david
rein
that's
a
specific
objection.
mr.
david
rein
he
does
not
have
--
he
can
contend
as
they
did
in
the
bowman
dairy
case
that
all
of
the
subpoenas
is
bad
--
mr.
david
rein
--
as
he
did
here.
what?
mr.
david
rein
well,
you
have
to
object
if
the
whole
subpoena
was
bad.
you
don't
have
to
say,
"i
think
part
of
it
is
good
and
part
of
it
is
bad."
mr.
david
rein
well,
he
did
say
why.
mr.
david
rein
you
don't
have
to
be
right.
my
point
is
this.
you
don't
have
to
be
right
in
all
respects.
mr.
david
rein
well,
certainly.
i
don't
think
there's
no
question
about
that.
we
argued
in
our
brief
and
it
set
out
that
certainly,
in
the
field
of
relations
between
state
and
its
own
employees
is
at
least
presumptively
a
matter
beyond
federal
jurisdiction.
that
for
the
government,
the
federal
government
to
invade
that
field,
it
must
make
at
least
a
positive
showing
as
to
why
it
is
justified
in
invading
that
field.
we
say
here
that
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
at
all.
there
was
none
in
the
court
below.
there
was
none
at
the
trial.
the
only
thing
that
is
presented
here
is
the
argument
of
the
government
which
i
can
only
characterize
as
fanciful.
that
the
subcommittee
might
have
been
interested
in
doing
something
about
that
section
of
the
constitution
which
guarantees
to
the
state,
every
state
in
the
union
a
republican
form
of
government.
the
government
however,
does
not
carry
that
contention
to
the
point
of
trying
to
establish
a
nexus
between
these
lists
of
names
in
that
purpose.
i
want
to
turn
out
briefly
to
our
contention
that
in
any
event,
a
judgment
of
acquittal
should
be
--
be
enacted
because
of
the
failure
to
inform
the
petitioner
of
the
pertinency
of
these
records
as
required
by
watkins.
the
government
concedes
here
that
nothing
was
said
at
the
hearing
which
would
satisfy
this
requirement,
nothing
at
all.
it
contends
however
as
did
the
court
below
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
satisfy
this
requirement
for
three
separate
reasons.
one,
that
the
subject
was
indisputably
clear
from
the
tenor
of
the
proceedings
in
any
event.
two,
it
argues
that
petitioner
did
not
adequately
raise
the
issue
with
pertinency.
and
three,
in
any
event,
the
petitioner
was
well
aware
of
both
the
subject
of
inquiry
and
the
pertinency
of
the
list.
i
think
so
far
as
the
first
subject
is
concerned,
that
everything
was
so
clear,
but
nothing
need
be
said.
i've
already
addressed
myself
sufficiently
on
that
point
and
need
not
go
into
it.
on
the
second
point,
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
did
not
adequately
raise
the
objection
of
pertinency,
i'd
like
to
look
at
the
record
on
that
and
indicate
what
was
it
that
the
petitioner
did
say.
now,
he
said,
first,
that
he
thought
that
the
list
was
being
asked
for
--
for
blacklisted
purposes.
well
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
going
back
to
what
i
referred
to
early
in
the
brief
and
going
over
that.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
he
said
that
the
subpoena
was
a
wholesale
invasion
of
privacy
and
violated
the
fourth
amendment
rights.
in
that
connection,
the
government
makes
a
curious
contention.
it
says
that
the
petitioner's
reliance
on
the
fourth
amendment
was
that
in
fact
a
--
made
omission
of
pertinency.
i
must
say
it's
always
been
my
contention
that
my
understanding
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
constitutional
provision
of
protecting
individual
against
the
demand
for
irrelevant
documents.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
was
required
to
use
autistic
terms,
he
certainly
did
it
when
he
placed
his
objection
on
the
fourth
amendment.
he
said
also
that
he
thought
the
list
was
being
used
for
blacklisting
purposes.
he
was
cut
off
in
the
middle
of
an
objection
in
which
he
said
that
he
thought
the
demand
infringed
here
on
an
area
which
just
crosses
the
boundaries
of
individual
rights
as
well
as
trade
union
rights.
at
that
point,
it
was
senator
watkins
who
said,
"i
don't
care
what
your
argument
is."
he
had
also
said,
when
he
said
he
thought
it
would
be
a
blacklisting
purpose,
senator
watkins
said
that,
"well,
this
is
an
executive
session.
we
can
keep
this
private."
he
said
at
that
time.
"why
don't
you
keep
it
private?
i
don't
see
how
it
would
be
relevant
to
any
purpose
even
to
the
illegitimate
purpose
of
blacklisting."
now,
i
contend,
i
don't
see
how
a
witness
could
more
clearly
state
his
objection
to
lack
of
pertinency
than
the
witness
has
done
here.
we
must
remember
that
the
witness
is
after
all
are
not
lawyers.
there
were
some
discussions
here
about
the
fact
that
witnesses
do
have
counsel
in
these
proceedings
and
the
witness
did
have
counsel
in
this
proceeding.
i'd
like
to
just
talk
about
that
for
one
minute.
in
these
proceedings
the
role
of
counsel
is
limited
to
advising
the
witness
by
a
sort
of
whispering
and
the
witness
is
here
as
things
come
up
as
to
what
the
witness
might
say.
counsel
does
not
have
the
privilege
and
counsel
is
not
permitted
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
make
objections
on
behalf
of
the
witness.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
to
expect
that
what
the
witness
is
going
to
say
is
going
to
come
out
in
the
most
precise
legal
terms
or
that
they
are
required
to
come
out
in
the
most
precise
legal
terms
is
more
than
hypothetical.
and
i
say
under
any
stand
and
even
if
hypothetical
standard,
the
petitioner
here
clearly
objected
to
the
pertinency.
and
therefore
--
he
was
under
watkins
entitled
to
be
informed
as
to
what
the
pertinency
was.finally
the
government
adapting
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
inform
petitioner
of
the
pertinent
subject
under
of
inquiry
of
pertinency
because
he
knew
it
any
way.
on
that,
i
do
not
want
to
risk,
to
paraphrase
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
i
don't
think
i
can.i
think
i
would
like
to
read
it
to
indicate
what
judge
prettyman
said
on
that
score
in
the
second
opinion.
i'm
reading
now
from
page
34
of
my
brief
quoting
from
the
record
at
117.
judge
prettyman
said,
"even
if
the
resolution
is
vague,
flaxer's
responses
to
questions
demonstrated
that
he
knew
what
the
subject
of
the
inquiry
was.
in
response
to
the
subpoena,
he
produced
the
financial
and
various
other
records
of
his
union
and
without
objecting,
presented
them
to
the
committee
on
the
record.
he
thus
indicated
that
he
recognized
the
nature
of
the
question
under
inquiry."
now,
i
would
submit
that
this
passage
just
doesn't
have
any
semblance
of
logic
whatsoever.
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
no
objection
to
presenting
the
financial
records
of
the
unions
certainly
doesn't
indicate
knowledge
of
any
kind.
and
even
if
they
did
have
knowledge
as
to
the
financial
records
of
the
union
being
pertinent
to
something,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
follow
from
that
or
draw
from
that
the
inference
that
he
knew
the
pertinency
of
the
membership
list.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
--
i
will.
mr.
david
rein
as
a
matter
--
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
the
matter
is
covered
rather
fully,
if
i
may
say
so,
in
our
brief
in
page
43
on
to
page
52.briefly
our
contention
rest
as
follows.
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
christoffel
against
the
united
states
which
held
that
a
witness
there
was
not
guilty
of
perjury
unless
his
testimony
was
given
before
a
full
quorum
of
the
committee.
the
senate
rules
was
changed
by
senate
resolution,
i
think
1
(a)
to
provide,
and
here
is
the
language
of
the
change.
that
--
well,
the
actual
language
of
the
rule
appears
earlier
in
the
brief
at
page
3
or
page
4
rather
(b).
each
standing
committee
and
each
subcommittee
of
any
such
committee
is
authorized
to
fix
a
lesser
number
than
one-third
of
its
entire
membership
who
shall
constitute
a
quorum
thereof
for
the
purpose
of
taking
sworn
testimonies.
the
legislative
history
showed
that
the
purpose
of
this
change
in
the
resolution
was
solely
to
meet
the
problem
of
perjury
in
the
christoffel
case.
senator
hayden
who
introduced
the
resolution
said
it
makes
no
other
changes
in
the
requirements
of
a
quorum.
it
is
our
contention
that
for
an
important
issue
of
this
kind
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
senate
wished
so
extravagantly
to
demand
--
demand
over
objections
of
the
petitioner.
you
have
to
have
more
than
a
single
senator
to
decide
that
question.
i'd
like
to
indicate
that
this
question
had
never
been
decided
in
advance
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena.
as
it
appears
from
the
record
there
had
been
no
meeting
of
the
committee
which
decided
to
issue
the
subpoena.
and
we
say
and
i
don't
think
i
have
more
time
to
say
that
it
is
fully
developed
in
our
brief
--
mr.
david
rein
yes,
it
appears
on
page

mr.

and

mr.
david

no.
we
are
not
--
we
limit
ourselves
here
in
this
case
to
say
that
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
rule
on
objections
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
we
do
not
examine
the
question
of
his
power
to
rule
on
objection
to
questions
alone.
we
say
when
it
comes
to
documents
that
sworn
testimony,
the
phrase
"takes
sworn
testimony"
does
not
include
the
power
to
require
the
production
of
documents.
we
say
that
that
is
a
sensible
rule.
mr.
david
rein
we
are
limiting
our
argumentation
here
to
say
he
cannot
pass
upon
the
validity
of
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
produce
documents.
we
are
not
arguing
the
question
of
what
power
he
might
have
for
particular
questions.
we
say
document
is
in
a
different
category
and
sworn
testimony
does
not
cover
documents.
mr.
david
rein
plus
our
argument.
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
our
argument.
mr.
david
rein
he
was
under
oath.
mr.
david
rein
well,
now
the
here
--
the
issue
here
is
a
narrow
one.
he
presented,
in
my
view,
this
is
the
only
opportunity
he
had
to
come
before
a
quorum
to
present
objections
in
a
court
let
us
say,
if
a
subpoena
is
issued,
that
is,
it
would
be
by
an
attorney.
you
go
before
a
court
and
you
say,
"i
don't
think
the
subpoena
should
be
obeyed."
you
make
your
argument.
you
get
your
ruling
from
a
competent
tribunal.
this
was
as
it
were,
mr.
flaxer's
day
in
court.
this
was
his
opportunity
to
say
and
he
wanted
to
say
to
a
quorum
of
the
committee,
i
don't
think
you
should
enforce
the
subpoena
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
i
think
it's
invalid.
secondly,
and
this
should
not
be
overlooked
even
if
they
had
the
power,
their
important
policy
considerations
in
terms
of
a
general
attitude
toward
unions
nationally.
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
those
considerations
passed
upon
by
a
full
quorum
of
the
subcommittee
and
not
by
a
single
senator
who
could
not
act
as
a
quorum
--
mr.
david
rein
honestly,
i
don't
have
--
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
here.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
it
had
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
it
may
or
may
not.
i
was
saying
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
we
limit
ourselves
to
that.
we
don't
necessarily
assume
the
other.
we
don't
think
it's
present
in
the
case.
that's
all
i
would
say
about
that.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
a
quorum
of
the
committee's
rule
on
that
motion
and
he
did
know
it.
mr.
david
rein
well,
--
mr.
david
rein
it
was
signed
by
the
committee
chairman.
the
testimony
shows
it
was
prepared
by
the
staff
of
the
subcommittee
and
we
tried
to
find
out
whether
there
had
been
any
kind
of
a
meeting,
and
apparently,
there
hadn't
been
any
formal
meeting
of
the
subcommittee
to
decide
the
issue
of
the
subpoena.
the
testimony
is
that
it
was
prepared
by
mr.
arens
and
another
member
of
his
staff
that
were
sent
over
to
senator
mccarran
for
his
signature.
mr.
david
rein
according
to
the
rules,
it's
issued
--
they
are
issued
by
the
chairman.
mr.
david
rein
at
least
to
that,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
you
would
have
the
situation
here
with
senator
watkins,
i
don't
think
he
would
have
the
authority
to
invalidate
the
subpoena
standing
by
himself
after
it
had
been
issued
by
the
chairman.
so,
therefore
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
right.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
my
time
is
up.
mr.
david
rein
well,
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
david
rein
i'll
make
just
two
brief
comments.
first,
to
address
myself
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
whittaker
during
the
argument
about
whether
or
not
this
statement
of
--
of
mr.
flaxer
be
--
could
be
considered
as
a
nature
of
a
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
i
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
page
42
of
the
record,
the
last
paragraph
of
mr.
flaxer's
statement
which
he
used
this
language,
and
i
think
it
throws
light
on
that
question,
“i
am
confident
that
the
members
of
this
committee,
after
considering
my
views
and
after
the
study
of
the
full
implications
of
the
request
made
in
the
subpoena,
will
realize
its
conflict
with
the
basic
union
tradition
of
this
country
now
incorporated
to
federal
law
and
withdraw
the
demand
for
membership
list.”
so,
i
think
in
effect
what
he
was
doing
was
asking
the
committee
to
withdraw
his
opinion.
one
other
point
i
want
to
address
myself
to
very
briefly
and
that
was
the
point
raised
from
the
brief
of
the
government.
i
don't
think
mr.
hitz
got
to
accept
by
reference
to
the
brian
case,
and
that
is
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
petitioner
here
cannot
avail
himself
of
any
of
the
events
--
of
any
of
the
events
that
occurred
at
the
hearing
because
says
the
government
“even
if
he
had
them
properly
directed
by
a
quorum
to
answer
and
as
appropriately
had
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
explained
by
a
quorum,
he
would,
nevertheless,
have
refused
to
answer.”
we
understand
the
doctrine
of
watkins.
this
court
does
not
speculate
as
to
what
a
witness
would
have
done
if
the
requirements
which
were
imposed
upon
the
committee
by
the
watkins
case
are
not
met.
and
that
as
long
as
those
things
are
not
met,
it's
unnecessarily
to
consider
as
to
what
the
witness
would
have
done.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
did
not
do
that
in
watkins,
and
it
did
not
do
that.
and
i
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
in
watkins,
the
witness
even
more
strongly
than
here
indicated
that
he
was
going
to
refuse
to
answer.
i
do
not
--
i'm
reading
now
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
watkins
on
185.
there,
watkins
said,
“i
do
not
believe
that
such
questions
are
relevant
to
the
work
of
this
committee
nor
do
i
believe
that
this
committee
has
the
right
to
undertake
the
public
exposure
of
persons
because
of
their
past
activities.
i
may
be
wrong
that
the
committee
may
have
this
power,
but
until
and
unless
a
court
of
law
so
holds
and
directs
me
to
answer,
i
most
firmly
refuse
to
discuss
the
political
activities
of
my
past
associates.”
i
think
that
this
is
clearly
in
conflict
with
the
argument
of
the
government
here
that
the
true
basis,
the
government
puts
in
its
brief,
the
true
basis
of
petitioner's
refusal
to
answer
was
his
objections
that
it
was
--
the
subpoena
was
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
was
not
on
the
ground
of
the
events
that
occurred
at
the
hearing
as
i
say
that
that
is
no
reason
or
whether
that
can
be
raised
with
the
defense.
thank
you.
