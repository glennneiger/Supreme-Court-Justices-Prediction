chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
52,
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
your
time
is
up
but
we've
taken
so
much
of
your
time
for
questions,
you
may
have
five
minutes
in
rebuttal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
mr.
hitz,
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
if
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
wish
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hitz,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
we
know
from
this
record
whether
he
had
the
possession
of
the
membership
list
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
as
an
abstract
question,
can
a
person
who
does
not
have
possession
of
records
be
convicted
of
contempt
for
failure
to
produce
them
or
to
do
the
necessary
work
which
would
enable
him
to
get
them
and
make
up
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
due
to
his
own
fault.
due
to
the
fact
that
he
--
i
said
that
he
didn't
have
them
in
his
possession.
would
that
--
could
he
--
could
he
still
be
in
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
was
in
whether
he
had
possession
of
them
in
washington.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
whether
he
had
possession
of
them
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
the
officer
who
had
possession
of
those
or
in
order
to
comply
with
the
subpoena,
would
it
have
been
necessary
for
him
to
get
them
from
the
possession
of
someone
else
and
make
up
the
list
as
required
by
the
subpoenas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question
then.
assuming
that
you
are
correct
in
your
position
that
this
is
a
contempt
as
of
the
return
day
on
the
subpoena
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
time
these
proceedings
were
--
were
held.
and
senator
watkins
said
just
what
he
said
in
this
record.
but
suppose
he
did
not
wait
the
10
days.
suppose
he
took
it
to
the
district
attorney
the
following
day
and
he
was
indicted
the
following
day
for
contempt,
could
we
have
sustained
--
could
we
sustain
a
conviction
for
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
--
and
what
--
what
senator
watkins
said
about
giving
him
10
days
in
which
to
comply
would
be
of
no
effect
whatsoever
so
far
as
--
on
bearing
on
the
question
of
contempt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hitz,
may
i
ask
you
a
very
simple
--
about
a
very
simple
contempt
case?
suppose
a
man
was
served
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
on
the
return
day,
he
came
into
court
and
the
judge
says,
"have
you
the
documents?"
and
he
said,
"no.
your
honor,
i
haven't
been
--
i've
just
been
too
busy
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
around
to
it."
and
the
judge
is
very
much
provoked,
and
he
says
to
the
man,
"now,
you
have
not
acted
fairly
with
this
court.
you
should
have
given
that
time
to
--
you
should
have
brought
those
things
here."
well,
he
said,
"i
just
haven't
done
it."
and
the
court
says
to
him,
"well
now,
in
spite
of
the
--
your
unfairness
to
the
court,
i'm
going
to
order
you
to
bring
those
in
10
days
from
today
and
if
you
don't,
you
have
to
take
the
legal
consequences."
has
he
committed
a
contempt
on
that
first
day?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
we
don't
have
to
assume
he's
correct
in
it.
we
assume
he's
--
he
was
wrong
and
that
the
judge
felt
that
he
was
wrong.
the
judge
says,
"you've
dealt
unfairly
with
the
court.
and
--
and
you
did
have
a
time
and
you
should
have
had
them
here.
but
i'm
going
to
give
you
10
days
more
to
do
it
and
if
you
don't
bring
them
within
that
time,
i
--
you
have
to
take
the
legal
consequences."
what
--
what
about
that?
where
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
even
though
the
judge
said,
"i'm
going
to
give
you
10
days
more
in
which
to
produce
the
documents.
and
if
you
don't
do
it
by
that
time,
you
have
to
take
the
legal
consequences,"
that
--
that
they
could
find
him
guilty
of
contempt
right
then
and
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
make
the
distinction
between
“that
will
be
the
order”
and
“that
is
the
order”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
you
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
take
the
--
the
last
question
and
answer
toward
the
bottom
of
page
50
where
mr.
arens
says
to
mr.
flaxer,
“will
you
produce
it
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
chairman
of
this
session
within
10
days
from
today?”
mr.
flaxer,
“i
will
have
to
take
that
under
consideration.”
senator
watkins,
“that
is
the
order
and
of
course
we
will
have
to
take
whatever
steps
unnecessary
if,
at
the
end
of
that
time,
you
have
not
produced
them.”
now,
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
it
--
it
--
that
is
tantamount
to
senator
watkins
saying
“i
find
you
in
--
in
contempt
of
the
--
of
the
committee
but
i
still
order
you
to
bring
these
--
bring
these
documents
before
the
committee
within
10
days”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
there
is
no
distinction
between
that
language
and
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
the
same
effect,
let
me
say,
if
that
was
--
if
that
was
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
bearing
on
the
question
as
to
whether
a
contempt
is
committed
on
this
day,
the
return
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
day
of
the
subpoena.
if
instead
of
--
of
this
question
and
answer
which
i
have
read
to
you
in
senator
watkins'
statement
“that
is
the
order
and
of
course,
we
will
have
to
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
if
at
the
end
of
the
time,
you
have
not
produced
that.”
is
that
any
difference?
does
that
convey
any
different
effect
than
if
he
had
said,
“mr.
flaxer,
i
find
you
in
contempt
for
what
you
have
done
in
not
producing
these
records
today
and
i
now
direct
you
to
bring
them
here
10
days
from
now”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
--
that's
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
purpose
would
it
serve
then
for
--
for
a
man
to
make
any
kind
of
objections
before
senator
watkins
if
he
had
no
power
other
than
to
direct
him
to
answer
in
accordance
with
the
subpoena
and
that
if
he
didn't
answer
it,
he'll
be
guilty
of
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
it
go
to
the
extent
of
giving
senator
watkins
the
power
to
--
to
say
“i
agree
with
your
objection”?
the
subpoena
is
not
valid
so
far
as
you
are
concern.
you
may
be
excused.
does
it
have
that
--
does
he
have
that
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
now,
suppose
--
do
you
--
you
say
but
he
committed
the
contempt
in
not
--
in
not
bringing
these
documents
at
that
particular
time.
suppose
after
senator
watkins
took
that
position,
the
whole
committee
decided
to
commit
him
for
contempt,
would
it
be
in
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
senator
watkins
says
“i
agree
with
your
--
with
your
objection.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
not
pertinent
--
pertinent
or
to
draw
or
some
--
something
of
that
kind
and
you
may
be
excused
in
answer
--
before
he
answer
the
question.
now,
you
throw
doubt
on
whether
he
has
that
power
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
--
let's
put
it
this
way
then.
let's
say
that
--
that
there
--
the
--
the
subpoena
directed
him
to
bring
not
only
the
list
of
the
members
in
the
federal
government
but
the
list
of
members
in
the
state
and
county
governments.
suppose
senator
watkins
said,
“i
think
that
the
subpoena
is
too
broad
and
i
will
direct
you
only
to
--
to
bring
those
that
are
in
the
federal
government
and
the
rest
--
as
to
the
rest
of
the
subpoena,
it's
--
it's
quashed.”
now,
did
he
have
power
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
power
doesn't
he
have
then?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
didn't
have
any
--
any
power
to
bury
the
terms
of
that
subpoena.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
very
--
very
greatly
if
he
says
“all
you
have
to
do
under
this
subpoena
is
to
bring
in
the
names
of
those
that
are
working
for
the
federal
government
but
you
are
not
require
to
bring
in
those
that
are
working
for
the
state
government
or
the
county
government.
isn't
that
modifying
it
just
as
much
as
giving
a
man
more
time
to
comply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rein.
