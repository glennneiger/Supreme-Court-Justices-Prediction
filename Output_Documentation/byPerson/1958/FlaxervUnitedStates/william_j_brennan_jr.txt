as
only
been
a
formal
demand
was
the
production
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
follows
mr.
hitz,
is
again,
they
start
the
colloquy
all
over
again,
and
he
was
asked
if
he
was
fencing
with
the
committee.
are
they
not
in
his
record,
particularly
what
follows
indicates
that
he's
quite
assuming
--
believed
that
he
ought
not
to
require
to
turn
them
over
and
never
actually
refused
to.
senator
watkins
kept
trying
to
persuade
him
that
the
grounds
he
was
taking
was
erroneous
and
were
wrong
and
reluctant
finally
ended
up
that's
the
end
of
it
but
we'll
give
you
10
more
days.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
failed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
produce
and
so
there's
no
question
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
refused
to,
in
a
sense
--
which
in
a
sense,
in
that
day,
i
--
just
strikes
me
as
though
what
--
the
way
the
senator
ended
up,
be
it
the
fact
to
say,
a
very
patient
man.
he
always
was.
and
he
says,
â€˜well,
now
look,
we
just
don't
have
any
merits
on
the
grounds
so
i
think
you
better
go
back
here
in
10
days."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
involve
here
though
that
any
criminal
charge
open
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
ground,
isn't
it,
which
is
evident
of
the
presiding
jury
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
denied,
a
jury
can
then
--
a
verdict
of
guilt
(inaudible)
never
gone
to
the
jury,
now
isn't
that
the
problem
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that's
the
fact
that
the
jury
came
up
with
the
verdict,
it
doesn't
really
stated
any,
does
it?
