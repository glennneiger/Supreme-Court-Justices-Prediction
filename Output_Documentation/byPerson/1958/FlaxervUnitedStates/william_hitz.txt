mr.
william
hitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
hitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
before
addressing
myself
to
the
history
of
this
particular
hearing
and
the
history
of
the
subcommittee
and
its
relationships
in
perspective
with
the
un-american
activities
committee
of
the
house
which
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
court
before
i
conclude
my
argument.
i
would
like
first
to
correct
certain
--
perhaps
misimpressions
that
have
been
advanced
here.
inadvertently
i
know
by
mr.
rein
with
reference
to
the
proceeding
that
mr.
flaxer
testified
before.
now,
mr.
rein
made
a
very
fair
statement
i
believe
of
the
background
of
this
case
and
perhaps
because
there
was
a
question
asked
him,
he
did
not
fully
state
what
i
think
is
an
important
part
of
the
factual
background.
namely,
that
mr.
flaxer
who
have
been
served
at
--
in
beekman
street
in
new
york
city
where
his
office
was
located,
some
19
days
prior
to
the
return
date
of
the
subpoena,
apparently
from
his
own
testimony,
made
no
effort
whatever
to
obtain
the
list
of
members
of
his
union
to
comply
with
those
several
parts
of
this
--
of
those
two
parts
of
the
subpoena
which
called
for
his
government
employees
in
federal
government
and
his
governmental
employees
in
state
government.
and
instead
of
gathering
that
information
and
bringing
it
with
him
in
his
own
custody
of
that
of
his
lawyer
and
keeping
it
in
his
briefcase
to
object
to
when
it
was
called
for.
he
made
no
effort
in
new
york
to
comply.
he
came
to
washington.
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
hearing
which
took
place
here
of
course
or
we
would
not
be
here.
the
united
states
attorney's
office
for
washington
would
not
be
here.
he
produced
all
available
material,
the
financial
reports
which
might
have
had
some
burden,
some
impact
upon
him,
i
do
not
know,
he
doesn't
say
so.
but
he
produced
everything
except
the
membership
lists.
and
he
--
mr.
william
hitz
i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
hitz
we
know
inferentially
your
honor
that
--
that
he
did
not
because
after
he
had
failed
and
refused
to
produce
the
membership
list
here
in
washington
in
answer
to
the
subpoena
duces
tecum.
he
stated
that
he
did
not
have
the
material
available
--
that
he
did
not
have
the
material
and
would
not
produce
it.
that's
the
way
he
put
it.
and
i
will
come
to
that
and
quote
it
from
the
record.
and
he
said
that
he
would
not
produce
it
because
he
said,
"i
feel
incapable
of
doing
so."
and
apparently
in
context
what
he
had
referenced
to
was
as
an
official
of
the
union
he
felt
that
legally
he
was
incapable
of
disclosing
the
membership
list.
but
that
was
in
respect
--
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
yes.
if
the
failure
to
have
them
at
the
time
of
demand
was
at
his
own
--
was
due
to
his
own
fault.
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
i
think
so.
i
don't
think
possession
in
washington
is
the
determining
factor
here
at
all
with
reference
to
his
contempt.
i
think
he
committed
the
background
of
the
contempt
when
he
failed
to
equip
himself
to
comply
in
washington
when
the
demand
was
made.
and
i
think
the
possession
that
he
did
not
have
perhaps
the
possession
in
washington
is
immaterial
if
he
deliberately
and
intentionally
made
himself
incapable
of
complying
by
reason
of
leaving
the
material
in
new
york
city.
mr.
william
hitz
oh.
mr.
william
hitz
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
--
mr.
william
hitz
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
the
record
is
clear
that
he
had
the
material
available
to
him
in
new
york
city
and
after
a
demand
had
been
made
and
this
was
one
point
that
mr.
rein
did
not,
i
think,
sufficiently
opened
up
to
the
--
to
the
court's
consideration.
after
he
had
been
told
by
the
chairman
that
we
demand
the
production
of
the
membership
lists
in
answer
to
the
subpoena,
and
he
said,
"i
don't
have
them
and
i
don't
think
i'm
capable
of
producing
them,"
then,
and
in
order
to
accomplish
the
legislative
purpose
that
was
here
involved
and
it's
an
important
one,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
--
of
the
subcommittee,
senator
watkins,
then
probed
him
as
to
the
possibility
of
obtaining
future
compliance
upon
as
then
issued
oral
order
for
him
to
comply
within
10
days.
and
in
the
course
of
that,
mr.
flaxer
stated
that,
"i
can
obtain
the
material.
it
would
take
me
about
a
week
to
do
so."
and
--
then
the
interrogator,
mr.
arens
suggested
to
the
chairman
that
there
then
and
now,
be
given
an
oral
order
to
produce
within
10
days.
and
that
was
done.
and
mr.
flaxer
was
told
to
produce
within
10
days.
the
contempt
we
say
having
already
been
completed
with
respect
to
the
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
subpoena
returnable
on
the
hearing
day
on
the
5th
of
october.
mr.
william
hitz
i
do
not.
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
strain
and
torturous
interpretation
of
the
record
and
that
it
would
be
strictly
an
afterthought.
mr.
william
hitz
are
we
still
on
the
fifth
--
mr.
william
hitz
well,
first,
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question
by
giving
my
conclusion
which
is,
that
this
was
not
a
modification
of
the
subpoena
direction.
and
that
it
was
an
effort
after
the
futility
of
any
further
demands
had
been
clearly
--
had
been
exhibited
because
he
didn't
have
the
material.
this
was
a
further
effort
by
senator
watkins
to
obtain
the
material
nevertheless
at
what
future
time
it
might
be
able
to
be
provided.
and
i
would
like
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
having
stated
my
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
go
back
now
and
attempt
to
support
it
to
you
from
the
record.
and
i
think
it
would
be
well
since
we
are
on
this
subject
of
the
demand
in
answer
to
quinn
and
also
on
the
subject
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
postponement
of
the
subpoena's
requirement
that
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
initial
demand
that
--
to
comply.
now,
if
the
--
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
on
page
40
of
the
record
--
on
page
39
of
the
record,
and
i
may
say
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
mr.
flaxer
stated
that
his
office
was
in
new
york.
the
record
at
some
other
point
indicates
that
he
was
served
on
beekman
street
in
new
york
city
with
the
subpoena
on
september
19
to
appear
on
the
fifth
which
is
this
day.
then,
mr.
flaxer
takes
over
and
he
notes
that
a
subpoena
had
been
served
on
him
and
he
says,
"i
produced
all
the
items,"
this
is
near
the
bottom.
mr.
flaxer:
"i
have
some.
i
produced
all
the
items
called
for
in
the
subpoena
except
one
item."
he
then
goes
through
the
items
that
he
did
produce
on
the
next
page
40,
his
bank
accounts
and
so
forth,
of
the
union.
and
then
through
the
page
40
and
the
first
part
of
41,
he
is
addressing
himself
to
that
subject
and
then
all
prepared
for
his
failure
and
we
say
refusal
to
produce
the
membership
list.
he
says
on
page
41,
"i
think
that
sums
up
the
records
which
are
required
with
respect
to
the
financial
status
of
our
organization.
the
item
which
i
have
not
produced
is
the
item
on
membership
list
of
our
union.
the
demand
for
the
production
of
this
item
raises
a
number
of
profoundly
serious
issues
and
so
forth."
he
was
interrupted
by
mr.
arens,
the
interrogator
who
asked,
"are
you
reading
from
a
prepared
statement?"
and
mr.
flaxer
said,
"yes."
"and
who
prepared
it?"
"i
did."
and
then,
as
it's
noted
on
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
the
--
the
next
page,
half
of
it,
he
makes
a
legal
argument,
more
or
less
of
a
legal
argument
that
he
is
not
permitted
by
--
i
think
by
the
law
as
he
said
to
produce
the
membership
list
to
an
employer
having
note
that
it
is
a
government
union,
government
employees'
union
that
he
is
head
of
and
he
said
that
the
taft-hartley
act
forbids
the
production
of
such
--
alleged
to
such
a
person,
that
is
the
employer.
i
would
like
to
interpolate,
i
think
he
is
not
correct
in
that
even
it
would
be
unlawful
or
prohibited
or
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
him
to
have
been
required
to
produce
to
an
industrial
employer
in
a
private
industry,
the
membership
lists
because
it
has
been
held
that
it
is
not
an
unfair
practice
per
se
for
an
employer
to
inquire
of
the
membership
of
a
union.
or
to
inquire
of
an
individual
member
whether
he
is
a
--
of
an
individual
employee,
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
union,
that
there
have
to
be
certain
aggravating
circumstances
to
the
mere
interrogation
in
order
to
encompass
an
unfair
labor
practice.
so
that
his
--
his
premise
i
think
is
not
a
correct
one
here
but
we're
not
concerned
too
much
with
that,
not
at
all
indeed.
and
he
attempts
nevertheless
to
carry
that
over
into
the
field
of
government
employment.
that
is
his
objection.
his
objection
is
not
to
the
make-up
of
the
committee.
he
made
the
blanket
objection
that
he
was
not
before
a
quorum
but
his
real
objection
is
with
respect
to
a
privilege
that
he
said
he
had
with
respect
to
delivering
over
the
list
of
employees.
mr.
william
hitz
i
do
not
sir.
mr.
william
hitz
every
individual?
mr.
william
hitz
oh.
mr.
william
hitz
well
i
think
he
is
--
i
think
there,
he
is
objecting
to
the
production
of
this
particular
item
under
this
subpoena.
and
having
that
in
mind,
i
--
i
would
like
to
revise
and
correct
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
think
to
that
extent
pro
tanto,
he
is
objecting
on
the
grounds
of
the
--
perhaps
the
scope
of
the
subpoena.
mr.
william
hitz
i'd
--
mr.
william
hitz
yes.
mr.
william
hitz
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
he
should
come
insofar
as
he's
physically
able
--
he's
able
to
do
so.
i
think
he
should
come
prepared
to
add
--
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
mr.
william
hitz
and
if
he
doesn't,
then
he
is
in
contempt
because
he
can't
assume
in
advance
either
one
of
the
two
possibilities
in
his
favor.
number
one,
he
can't
assume
that
the
decision
of
the
tribunal
is
going
to
be
in
his
favor
on
his
"motion
to
quash".
number
--
mr.
william
hitz
he
--
mr.
william
hitz
he
certainly
cannot.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
then
he's
had
--
he's
had
a
--
he's
had
a
ray
of
sunshine
i
think
brought
into
his
appearance
before
the
tribunal
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
and
could
not
expect
to
see.
mr.
william
hitz
no,
i
think
--
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
that
--
i
think
--
mr.
william
hitz
i'm
sorry.
i
think
his
--
his
contempt
is
complete
and
i
think
that
he
would
then
have
certain
equities
on
his
side
with
respect
to
an
endeavor
to
have
the
tribunal
accept
a
later
compliance
as
a
purge.
mr.
william
hitz
correct.
he
certainly
did
your
honor.
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
it
has
but
i
don't
know
--
i
do
not
think
that
the
record
would
disclose
a
prosecutable
contempt.
i
think
because
there
--
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
i
--
i
think
there
is
because
i
don't
think
that
in
the
--
in
the
--
under
the
facts
that
you
put
to
me,
that
there
would
be
a
compliance
with
the
quinn
requirement.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
when
he
made
known
his
objection
and
when
the
tribunal
inferentially
agreed
with
it
to
the
point
of
having
excused
him
for
preparing
for
the
production
of
the
documents
and
making
himself
ready
and
able
to
produce
them
in
washington.
that
then
when
the
committee
doesn't
pursue
it
to
the
point
of,
we
demand
the
production
of
the
documents
here
today
but
instead
says,
"all
right,
we've
heard
your
objection,
it
was
no
doubt
well
meant.
you
don't
have
the
documents.
we
realized
that.
we
still
want
them.
we
will
now
permit
you
instead
of
complying
today,
as
you
can't
do,
and
instead
of
holding
you
in
contempt
today
as
we
can
do
but
won't,
we're
going
to
give
you
10
more
days."
they
could
do
that
and
we
would
not
be
able
to
try
that
case
under
the
quinn
doctrine.
mr.
william
hitz
well
it's
not
the
record
for
the
reason
that
the
court
rejected
the
legal
affirmative
defense
that
was
sought
to
be
interposed
here
to
the
production
of
the
documents.
with
the
--
the
tribunal
rejected
that
and
after
rejection,
made
a
formal
demand
which
completed
the
contempt
in
this
case.
mr.
william
hitz
sorry?
mr.
william
hitz
well,
the
formal
demand
--
only
if
i
could
proceed
on
because
i'm
about
to
get
right
to
that
point
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
hitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
hitz
all
right,
sir.
mr.
william
hitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
hitz
what
page
are
you
on
--
mr.
william
hitz
--
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
hitz
i
--
i
don't
dispute
it.
i
don't
know,
i'm
sure
of
it.
mr.
william
hitz
yes.
mr.
william
hitz
i
would
like
to
make
two
answers
to
that.
first,
the
part
that
you
have
referred
to
just
now
of
the
record
is
the
final
statement
on
that
subject.
that
is
on
the
subject
of
attempting
to
get
this
material
that
was
made
by
senator
watkins.
and
the
actual
demand
for
him
to
produce,
for
mr.
flaxer
to
produce
in
answer
to
the
subpoena
and
upon
the
rejection
of
his
objection
to
doing
so
occurs
much
--
much
colloquy
before
this
and
on
page
47
so
that
my
first
answer
to
you
is
that
the
demand
has
already
been
made.
the
content
has
been
complete.
it
is
then
a
prosecutable
contempt
under
the
requirements
of
the
quinn
case
and
from
then
on
there
is
--
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
i
think
he
probably
can.
i
don't
think
the
part
that
you've
just
read
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicates
in
its
full
context
that
the
chairman
has
changed
his
mind.
i
think
he
is
pursuing
now
an
oral
argument,
i
mean,
an
oral
demand
as
distinguished
from
the
subpoena
demand
which
has
already
been
rejected
by
the
witness
and
there
has
been
no
compliance
under
it
and
in
fact
he
was
incapable
of
complying
no
matter
what
had
been
said
at
the
--
at
the
hearing.
mr.
william
hitz
no.
incapable
at
the
time
that
he
appeared
in
answer
to
this
--
mr.
william
hitz
well,
--
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
yes.
but
when
that's
done,
the
witness
is
on
the
stand
suffering
the
possibility
of
being
held
in
contempt
if
he
does
not
answer
and
he
is
there
capable
of
complying.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
this
court
in
its
good
wisdom
decided
the
quinn
case
and
the
watkins
case
the
basis
for
both
of
those
cases
was
fundamental
fairness
which
found
expression
in
those
words
in
the
watkins
case
to
a
witness
who
was
subjected
to
the
penalties
of
contempt
because
to
judge
the
matter
adversely
to
the
rulings
of
the
committee
would
lead
him
to
contempt.
in
other
words,
a
witness
who
is
capable
of
producing
by
way
of
an
answer,
this
witness
here,
mr.
flaxer
had
rendered
himself
incapable
of
producing
in
new
york
city
before
he
came
to
washington.
mr.
william
hitz
and
that
--
mr.
william
hitz
we
will
give
you
10
days
now.
mr.
william
hitz
if
--
if
your
honor
will
--
i'm
speaking
from
the
record.
if
your
honor
will
--
will
bear
with
me
for
background
material
for
what
senator
watkins
has
just
been
quoted
by
you
to
say,
and
indeed
he
did
say
it
of
course.
let
me
get
to
the
background
of
what
he
said
or
what
he
meant,
and
what
had
transpired.
i
wonder
if
we
could
take
this
and
the
related
matters,
closely
related
matters
in
one
long
step
and
proceed
back
to
page
47
which
is
the
demand
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
and
just
above
the
--
now,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
page
46.
he
has
been
asked
to
locate
in
government
agencies
his
federal
government
employees
and
he
has
named
the
veterans
administration,
the
bureau
of
engraving
and
printing,
the
treasury
department
and
so
on.
and
then
he
was
asked
to
give
more
details.
mr.
arens:
"what
other
government
agencies
and
by
government,
i
mean,
the
united
states
government,
do
you
have
membership
in
irrespective
of
the
volume
of
the
membership?"
again,
i
say
i
really
couldn't
tell
you.
i
am
on
the
record
here
and
i
would
not
want
to
give
you
a
statement
that
may
not
be
entirely
correct.
you
can
give
your
best
judgment.
i
don't
know.
you
don't
have
any
judgment
on
that.
well,
i
don't
have
the
facts
on
the
basis
of
which
i
can
make
a
judgment
because
i
guess
that's
the
answer.
mr.
arens:
and
mind
you,
this
is
long
after
he
has
stated
that
he
did
not
bring
the
material
with
him
or
he
didn't
have
it
with
him.
mr.
arens:
"mr.
chairman,
i
respectfully
ask
of
the
chairman
that
the
witness
be
ordered
to
produce
for
this
record
in
compliance
with
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
served
upon
him
the
record
of
the
united
public
workers
showing
the
names
and
addresses
and
so
forth."
senator
watkins:
"do
you
understand
the
request
made
of
you?"
mr.
flaxer:
"yes,
i
do."
senator
watkins:
"do
you
stand
on
your
statement
that
you
refuse
to
produce
those?"
mr.
flaxer:
"i
didn't
say
i
refused.
i
indicated
the
situation
as
such
that
i
find
myself
incapable
of
producing
them."
and
i'm
interrupting
--
i'm
sure
he
means
that
he
didn't
feel
he
was
legally
capable
of
doing
it
but
he
was
physically
unable
to,
too.
i
think
if
i
complied
with
the
request
of
that
kind
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
i
have
the
right
either
in
terms
of
our
membership
or
in
terms
of
the
labor
movement
generally.
and
mr.
arens:
"but
you
do
have
the
information?"
mr.
flaxer:
"in
a
general
sense,
i
think
i
have
the
information."
mr.
arens:
"and
you
have
not
complied
with
the
command
of
the
subpoena
to
produce
that
information?"
mr.
flaxer:
"i
think
that
--
i
think
it
is
an
improper
command,
sir."
senator
watkins:
"that
is
the
reason
you
have
refused
to
bring
them
here
today."
and
i'm
interpolating
from
new
york.
i
think
the
context
is
clear
--
"because
you
think
it
is
improper?"
mr.
flaxer:
"that
is
the
reason
i
haven't
got
them."
senator
watkins:
"that
is
the
main
reason.
you
are
directed
by
the
committee
to
produce
those
records
according
to
the
terms
of
the
subpoena
and
there
is
the
demand
and
the
completion
we
say
of
the
--
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
he
said
i
do
not
refuse.
and
he
said,
i
mean
--
mr.
william
hitz
yes.
he
was
--
mr.
william
hitz
and
each
time
he
would
say
that
he's
incapable
they
would
tell
him
that
--
mr.
william
hitz
they
would
tell
him
that
he
had
to
produce
and
he
was
--
he
was
fencing
with
the
committee.
i
don't
think
the
committee
would
have
to
take
the
--
the
advance
of
this
--
the
advancement
of
this
objection
and
the
reargument
and
the
reassertion
of
it
time
after
time
so
that
there's
no
finality
to
the
proceeding.
i
think
that
senator
watkins
was
quite
patient
in
hearing
the
entire
objection
in
the
quibbling.
i
--
i
say
when
mr.
flaxer
said
i'm
not
refusing,
i'm
just
not
doing
it
and
finally
we
have
the
unequivocal
demand
by
senator
watkins.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that
when
someone
in
this
situation
does
not
produce
when
he
says
inferentially
that
he
cannot
produce
on
the
day
because
he
hasn't
prepared
the
documents
that
even
from
that
day
on
it
will
take
him
another
5
days
to
do
so
that
he
has
failed
to
produce.
mr.
william
hitz
and
--
mr.
william
hitz
indeed
he
did
do
that
and
--
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
think
that
my
contextual
argument
here
or
rather
it's
a
contextual
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
haven't
quite
complete
it
because
i
think
between
the
point
where
you
have
asked
me
this
question
and
the
point
where
mr.
justice
frankfurter
took
up
the
final
remark
of
senator
watkins
there
is
some
intervening
colloquy
which
will
indicate
clearly
the
position
which
we
take
namely
that
after
there
had
been
the
unequivocal
refusal,
the
failure
first
which
was
a
refusal
which
was
deliberate
and
intentional
therefore
a
violation
of
the
statute
had
been
completed
by
an
objection
being
advanced
in
senator
watkins
making
a
demand
that
there
was
then
an
oral
effort.
and
i'm
going
to
substantiate
what
i
contend
here
by
pointing
out
in
the
statements
of
senator
watkins
that
he
used
the
expression
"my
demand,
the
present
demand".
i
am
now
going
to
ask
you.
and
we
say
that
that
is
an
oral
demand
over
and
apart
from
and
in
addition
to
the
contempt
that
had
already
been
committed
under
the
demand
of
the
subpoena.
and
--
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
that
they
maybe
occurring
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
or
other
members
of
the
court
that
particularly
in
view
of
senator
watkins'
last
statement
that
if
he
had
indeed
produced
the
material
at
the
end
of
10
days,
would
we
have
had
the
contempt
case
based
upon
the
refusal
under
the
subpoena
on
the
fifth.
my
answer
to
that
is
very
likely
we
would
not,
because
there
would
have
been
some
bit
of
futility
in
doing
so
and
the
committee
would
have
had
the
material.
but
that
would
have
been
for
this
reason
only.
it
wouldn't
have
been
because
there
wasn't
a
contempt
on
the
fifth
in
answer
to
the
subpoena.
it
would
have
been
because
there
had
been
accepted
by
the
tribunal
a
purge
of
that
contempt
and
there
is
the
important
part
of
this
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
william
hitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
yes.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
william
hitz
not
under
these
facts.
and
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
two-fold.
first,
the
witness
cannot
enforce
upon
the
tribunal
a
purge.
a
purge
that
is
a
later
a
compliance
after
a
refusal
which
amounts
to
a
contempt
has
to
be
accepted
by
the
tribunal
in
order
to
be
a
purge
and
that
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
norris
case.
that's
a
partial
answer.
in
addition
to
that
however,
the
--
i
think
your
honor
or
i
think
perhaps
i
should
stress
again
that
there
has
been
no
misconception
given
to
the
witness
when
he's
on
the
stand
by
the
demeanor
of
the
committee
or
anything
that
was
said
by
its
chairman
which
led
to
the
complacency
of
the
witness
which
might
have
resulted
in
his
failure
to
comply.
in
other
words,
the
situation
is
not
one
where
there
is
a
refusal
to
answer
and
the
capability
of
answering.
in
other
words,
there
has
been
no
lulling
into
complacency
that
the
objection
has
been
sustained
or
that
for
some
reason
the
tribunal
has
changed
its
mind
and
that
witness,
this
witness
mr.
flaxer,
was
not
capable
of
complying
with
this
subpoena
at
the
--
on
the
fifth
of
october
when
he
was
before
the
committee.
and
he
had
rendered
himself
incapable
of
it.
so
that
the
very
equities
which
caused
this
court
to
decide
quinn
and
watkins
are
not
present
nor
is
the
danger
to
mr.
flaxer
at
present
which
this
court
remarked
upon.
this
court
remarked
upon
the
danger
to
the
witness
watkins
in
deciding
without
enough
information
something
which
where
it
cause
him
to
go
to
jail
for
contempt,
and
that
he
was
entitled
under
the
doctrine
of
fundamental
fairness
to
be
informed.
we
don't
have
a
watkins
witness
here.
we
have
a
witness
who
was
not
able
to
change
the
course
of
his
intent,
his
refusal
at
the
time
that
this
prior
colloquy
or
anything
else
was
said
or
could
have
been
said
to
him
in
washington.
mr.
william
hitz
it
so
turned
out.
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
yes,
he
did.
mr.
william
hitz
it
is.
mr.
william
hitz
it
is.
mr.
william
hitz
if
it
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
hitz
that
it
was
resolved
by
what?
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
think
that's
the
--
i
think
that
could
well
be
considered
the
final
answer
to
this
question.
i'm
giving
many
preliminary
ones
as
i
have
been
asked.
i
was
coming
to
that
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
possible
answer
to
the
point
that
the
jury
under
complete
and
adequate
inspections
on
this
particular
point
came
in
with
a
verdict
that
he
did
indeed
intend
to,
under
the
criminal
intent
that's
involved
here,
the
very
simple
one
of
an
intentional
act
did
intend
to
refuse
to
produce
the
documents
on
this
day.
however,
i
would
like
and
i'm
glad
to
mention
that
mr.
justice
clark
because
i
may
have
forgotten
it
although
it's
adequately
in
our
brief.
and
of
course,
we
do
not
need
to
discuss
the
importance
and
the
weight
which
might
even
be
a
finality
on
that
point
where
we
have
a
jury
question
decided
upon
proper
instruction.
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
if
this
record
is
considered
by
the
court,
of
course
to
be
so
insufficient
on
the
matter
of
--
mr.
william
hitz
--
of
willfulness,
of
course
the
matter
should
not
have
gone
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
does
on
these
--
on
these
facts.
i
would
like
to
make
this
suggestion.
i
feel
that
i
have
not
sufficiently
made
this
clear.
the
equities
that
have
been
advanced
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
others,
namely,
that
it's
possible
that
he
might
have
complied
in
answer
to
a
10-day
extension
of
time
within
which
to
comply
with
an
oral
order.
and
if
he
had
done
so,
we
would
have
factual
equities
which
would
have
affected
his
completed
contempt
on
the
bill.
and
there
is
where
i
think
we
are
confusing
this
record.
i
am
too.
i
didn't
mean
to,
and
i
hope
i
haven't
caused
the
confusion.
but
i
think
there
is
confusion
here
with
respect
to
a
contempt
that
was
complete
because
it
could
not
have
been
corrected
no
matter
what
the
committee
said,
did,
or
met
with.
and
the
desire
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
what
would
be
senator
watkins
purpose
in
giving
the
10-day
extension,
i'm
glad
to
have
that
opportunity
to
answer.
the
purpose
he
had
was
the
legislative
purpose
which
he
had
in
the
beginning
namely
to
obtain
this
information,
and
he
wanted
it.
he
wanted
it
more
than
a
prosecution
for
contempt.
and
when
he
didn't
get
either
one,
then
it
was
time
to
look
back
and
find
out
was
there
a
contempt
indeed
by
this
person
who
was
a
"contemptuous"
witness
because
he
didn't
give
an
answer
to
the
oral
demand.
he
said,
"i
will
think
it
over."
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
--
your
--
i
--
i
agree
with
the
facts.
i
disagree
with
the
conclusion.
you
suggest
perhaps
that
this
was
a
proper
procedure.
that
i
agree
with.
because
senator
watkins
wanted
to
obtain
the
information,
however,
i
disagree
with
the
premise
of
mr.
justice
black
in
your
question,
which
is
that
there
was
an
extension
of
the
original
demand.
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
not
in
the
truckload
situation
that
you
mentioned
but
we
don't
have
that
fact
here.
mr.
william
hitz
and
neither
did
mr.
flaxer
because
he
didn't
advance
that.
mr.
william
hitz
he
didn't
advance
it
because
it
was
obstructive
to
his
operations
of
the
union
or
obstructive
to
his
presence
to
that
the
committee
that
he
could
not
do
it
physically.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
william
hitz
well,
our
--
our
position
on
that
your
honor
is
that
he
was
capable
of
equipping
himself
in
new
york
where
the
papers
were,
the
tools
were.
he
was
capable
of
equipping
himself
to
comply
in
washington
on
the
fifth.
and
he
didn't
have
the
so-called
truckload
which
has
appeared
in
--
in
many
legal
arguments,
a
truckload
of
information
which
made
it
too
burdensome
for
him
to
bring
it.
he
was
capable
of
doing
so.
and
when
he
made
up
his
mind
during
the
19
days
interim
between
the
service
of
the
subpoena
and
his
appearance
here,
he
then
decided
upon
the
course
he
was
going
to
take
that
he
was
going
to
rely
upon
this
legal
argument
that
the
government
employer
was
not
entitled
to
the
employee's
names
and
he
came
to
washington
and
he
took
that
chance.
and
when
he
advanced
it
--
mr.
william
hitz
it
borders
on
the
frivolous.
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
--
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
he
probably
made
the
objection
or
--
let's
say,
i
will
not
contest
his
good
faith
in
making
the
objection.
i
hasten
to
say
if
the
court
well
--
is
aware
by
good
faith,
even
good
faith
instilled
by
advice
of
competent
counsel
is
not
a
defense
to
the
contempt
under
this
statute.
but
he
may
have
thought
that
he
had
a
point.
but
he
took
the
chance
if
he
was
capable
of
producing,
he
took
the
chance
that
one
of
two
things
would
happen,
either
that
he
would
have
his
objection
rejected
and
a
demand
made
with
finality.
or,
second,
that
he
would
be
given
additional
time
having
been
informed
that
he
had
his
objection
rejected.
that
he'd
be
given
additional
time,
not
an
extension,
but
additional
time
to
comply.
and
he
took
that
chance
and
his
objection
was
overruled.
he
was
given
time
within
which
to
reply
an
answer
nevertheless
and
he
didn't
do
that.
i
think
that
--
but
i
have
not
been
able
--
mr.
william
hitz
he
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
hitz
there
is
a
failure
of
the
intent
to
refuse
or
the
intent
to
disobey
which
is
a
refusal.
there
is
a
failure
of
the
criminal
intent
in
that
case
because
under
your
facts,
he
said
that
he
did
not
have
a
time
to
do
it.
and
we'll
assume
that
he
was
correct
in
that.
so,
he
can't
--
mr.
william
hitz
i
don't
think
there
is
any.
i
think
that
if
you
put
into
your
question
that
it's
not
necessarily
a
physical
incapacity
under
which
he
was
laboring,
that
is
if
he
could
do
it,
he
could
have
done
it
but
he
came
in
and
he
said,
"i
didn't
have
time."
mr.
william
hitz
that
then
becomes
a
jury
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
intended
to
refuse
to
produce
the
documents
under
the
willful
intent
of
this
statute
and
that
is
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
hitz
i
would
--
i
would
even
go
that
far
although
we
don't
need
to
in
this
case.
i
think
that
where
he
has
incapacitated
himself
from
producing
that
the
--
what
transpires
at
the
hearing
does
not
affect
the
intent
that
he
had
when
he
was
unable
to
comply.
he's
entirely
differently
situated
than
the
witness
who
can
answer
a
question.
because
when
the
witness
can
answer
a
question,
we
have
the
quinn
case
and
we
have
the
watkins
case
if
he
qualifies
for
the
watkins
ruling.
and
we
have
the
acts
of
the
committee
chairman
affecting
the
disposition
of
that
witness
with
respect
to
compliance
as
he
stands
on
the
witness
--
sits
in
the
witness
chair.
and
if
the
ambiguous
statement
or
if
they
offered
to
purge
in
the
next
period
of
time
has
given
him,
then
he
does
not
have
a
conscious
choice
on
the
witness
stand
to
refuse
to
answer
or
to
answer
it.
he
has
been
misled.
he
has
been
given
--
he's
been
lulled
into
complacency
as
the
case
has
hold.
and
it's
unfair
to
him.
he
has
not
achieved
the
criminal
contempt
necessary
for
violation
and
he
would
not
be
guilty.
if
however,
he
is
not
on
the
stand
capable
of
producing
and
complying
such
as
the
case
we
have
here,
in
that
case
the
statements
made
by
the
chairman
to
him
would
not
affect
his
criminal
intent,
would
not
affect
his
ability
to
comply,
it
would
affect
the
possibility
of
a
later
purge
which
is
not
of
his
doing.
mr.
william
hitz
i
like
however
to
attempt
to
(inaudible)
of
actual
picture
before
i
leave
this
point
and
to
illustrate
by
the
record,
the
conclusion
that
we
draw,
namely,
that
the
final
remarks
of
the
--
of
the
chairman,
senator
watkins
that
there
would
be
10
days
within
which
we
say
there
can
be
further
or
another
attempt
to
comply,
another
opportunity
to
comply
but
that
was
indeed
a
second
order
after
a
completed
contempt.
i
would
like,
leave
of
court,
to
please
invite
its
attention
to
page
48
of
the
record.
now,
after
the
demand
that
we
say
was
a
final
demand
and
completed
this
picture,
on
page
47,
mr.
flaxer
again
endeavors
to
reopen
the
matter
advancing
again
his
taft
--
supposed
taft-hartley
argument
of
incapability
of
performing
the
compliance
with
the
subpoena.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
48,
mr.
flaxer
concludes
this
effort
by
saying,
“sir,
i
don't
think
the
issue
has
ever
come
up
before.”
mr.
--
senator
watkins
then
indicating
again
the
finality
of
the
position
that
he
takes
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
comply
in
answer
to
the
subpoena
states,
“maybe
it
has
not
but
i
do
not
think
any
court
would
ever
resolve
itself
against
the
united
states
finding
out
what
organization
its
members
belong
to.”
there,
he
finally
puts
to
rest
this
affirmative
defense
that
mr.
flaxer
has
brought
into
the
hearing
room.
and
from
then
on,
there
is
the
second
effort
to
obtain
the
documents
in
answer
to
the
deep-rooted
legislative
purpose
here
and
mr.
arens
then
gets
down
to
the
immediate
subject.
“what
can
we
do
next
to
seek
compliance?
how
long
would
it
take
you,
mr.
flaxer?”
and
so
forth.
“could
it
be
done
in
a
week?”
it
could
be
--
imagine
it
could
be
done
in
a
week
and
he
is
given
10
days
or
at
least,
the
interrogator,
mr.
arens
says
--
suggests
10
days
and
senator
watkins
then
said,
“since
you
have
made
the
reply
that
it
could
be
done
in
a
week,
that
will
be
the
order
--
that
will
be
the
order
of
the
committee.”
now,
he
doesn't
say,
“we
are
releasing
you
from
the
subpoena.
that
will
be
the
order
of
the
committee,
that
you
submit
that
information
as
requested
by
counsel
not
as
extended
from
the
subpoena
for
the
committee
within
10
days
from
this
date.
the
record
will
show
that
you,
of
course,
have
been
given
that
notice
not
an
extension,
not
notice
and
that
requirement
has
been
made
and
the
order
has
been
made.
not
an
extension
of
the
subpoena,
it's
a
new
order.”
mr.
william
hitz
no,
i
make
the
distinction
between
order
and
subpoena
between
“this
is
the
order”
or
“that
will
be
the
order”
either
one
but
he
doesn't
say
we
will
extend
the
time
for
compliance
under
the
subpoena.
we
think
that's
extremely
important.
mr.
william
hitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
hitz
i
certainly
do.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
last
--
the
last
question.
i
agree
with
what
--
mr.
william
hitz
that
is
new
oral
order
was
one
that
would
have
to
be
complied
with
or
there
might
be
a
second
contempt.
mr.
william
hitz
yes.
mr.
william
hitz
i
don't
think
if
effects
the
instant
contempt
completed
on
this
day
of
hearing
--
mr.
william
hitz
--
under
the
subpoena.
mr.
william
hitz
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
and
this
was
going
to
be
the
last
contextual
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
here,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
exactly
what
your
honor
has
read
which
is
mr.
arens'
last
statement,
“will
you
produce
it
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
chairman
of
this
session
within
10
days
from
today”
is
not
extension
of
time.
we
say
from
that
and
other
contextual
items
in
here.
mr.
william
hitz
yes,
yes,
he
did.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
not
only
that
but
it
indicates
that
he
would
certainly
not
necessarily
comply
within
10
days
and
might
well
not
comply.
and
indeed,
he
didn't
comply
and
he
wrote
a
letter
and
he
said,
it
is
in
the
record
here
some
place
i
think
in
the
government
brief,
that
“i'm
not
going
to
comply
and
for
the
same
reasons
that
i
didn't
bring
the
records
to
your
hearing”.
now,
if
the
order
to
produce
within
10
days,
issued
orally
by
senator
watkins,
was
an
extension
of
time
and
if
it
obliterated
the
effect
of
the
failure
and
refusal
to
produce
under
the
subpoena
on
the
day
of
hearing,
that
oral
order
to
produce
in
the
next
10
days,
then
would
have
been
and
must
necessarily
be
considered
a
change
and
a
modification
of
the
subpoena
and
it
must
be
then
with
the
power
of
the
senator
watkins
to
do
so.
we
don't
think.
we
think
that
he
had
the
power
to
issue
the
oral
order.
we
do
not
think
he
had
the
power
to
change
the
subpoena
duces
tecum's
terms.
and
again,
i
repeat
that
the
doctrine
of
fundamental
fairness
which
gave
birth
to
the
quinn
and
the
watkins
cases
does
not
pertain
to
the
facts
in
this
case
and
does
not
in
any
way
influenced
mr.
flaxer
as
he
was
on
that
stand
incapable
of
producing
and
complying.
mr.
william
hitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
hitz
i
said
that
the
subpoena
returnable
under
its
terms
and
on
the
day
was
one
that
he
was
bound
to
comply
with
and
that
the
order
of
the
--
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
that's
probably
true.
i
would
like
--
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
end
result
that
you
anticipate
and
which
i
anticipate
can
be
arrive
at
in
this
fashion
that
he
would
have
the
power
and
probably,
the
right
to
consider
that
they
would
not
pursue
the
contempt
but
i
think
that
where
the
rule
require,
the
senate
rule
requires
that
subpoena
shall
issue
over
the
chairman's
signature,
and
that
does
happen.
i
don't
know
whether
one
individual
member
of
a
--
of
that
subcommittee
sitting
as
a
short
quorum
can
say
“we're
going
to
completely
disregard
the
terms
of
this
subpoena
and
you
don't
have
to
comply.”
i
think
that
he
may
well
--
could
have
been
overruled
if
he
attempted
to
do
that.
he
didn't
do
it
but
if
he
had
attempt
to
do
it
by
way
of
illustration,
i
think
that
the
committee
could
overrule
him
and
say
that
“we
want
the
chairman's
subpoena
which
was
served
on
the
19th
in
new
york
city
honored.
and
you,
senator
watkins
had
no
power
at
all
to
tell
him
at
the
hearing
when
he
was
incapable
of
complying
that
his
contempt
could
not
be
treated
as
a
contempt.”
mr.
william
hitz
oh,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
william
hitz
well,
i
think
that's
quite
true
with
respect
to,
not
only
ruling
on
objections,
but
also
to
receiving
documents
and
also
to
passing
on
the
documents.
but
whether
he
bury
the
terms
of
an
outstanding
subpoena,
i
think
is
a
different
question.
mr.
william
hitz
well,
justice
frankfurter
put
to
me
after
a
mark
that
i
made
does
the
--
does
the
one
man
short
quorum
who
is
a
person
other
than
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
does
he
have
the
right
to
bury
the
terms
of
a
subpoena
issued
under
his
--
under
the
name
of
the
chairman?
my
answer
to
that
is
he
probably
does
not.
however,
your
-
your
question
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
does
the
short
quorum
--
senator
watkins
have
the
power
to
rule
upon
an
objection?
i
think
that's
implicit
in
the
fact
that
he
was
given
that
power
to
sit
and
conduct
a
hearing.
i
don't
think
the
two
are
--
are
related.
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
he
does
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
mr.
william
hitz
that
is
that
senator
watkins
took
the
contrary
position?
mr.
william
hitz
yes.
mr.
william
hitz
no
--
mr.
william
hitz
--
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not.
i
throw
doubt
on
whether
or
not
he
could
change
the
terms
of
the
subpoena.
that
is
the
--
the
date
of
compliance.
i
think
--
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
so.
mr.
william
hitz
i
think
he
has
power
implicit
--
mr.
william
hitz
it
is
modifying
it
but
i
think
that
where
new
material
is
brought
before
the
person
who
is
the
presiding
officer
at
the
time
that
had
never
been
submitted
to
the
committee
before
and
if
he
considers
it
to
be
a
reasonable
departure
such
as
you
need
to
bring
in
the
--
the
municipal
matter,
i
think
that
he
can
excuse
that
witness
on
the
stand
from
complying
with
that
part
of
that
subpoena.
i
do
not
feel
that
he
could
say,
“now,
this
entire
subpoena
that
has
been
issued
by
our
chairman
as
required
by
the
rules,
and
i
did
not
issue
it,
you
may
disregard
this
completely,
and
you
may
turn
this
material
over
to
us
in
10
days.”
i
do
not
feel
that
he
has
that
--
that
power.
i
don't
think
that
bears
from
the
question.
it
may
be
illustrative
of
ceratin
of
the
aspects
of
the
discussion
here
but
it
certainly
doesn't
control
our
case.
i
--
i
would
like,
before
leaving
this
point,
and
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
recall
the
case
of
brian
which
has
much
in
it,
not
only
factually
but
much
that
were
said
in
it
like
the
case
that
we
have
here.
i
will
not
--
i
will
not
read
from
it.
i
would
just
like,
if
the
court
please,
as
requested
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
to
note
the
similarities
factually
and
legally
in
that
case.
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
indulgence.
