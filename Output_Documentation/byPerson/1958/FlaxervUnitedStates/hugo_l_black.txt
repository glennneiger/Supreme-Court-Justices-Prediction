what
do
you
say
about
the
statement
on
page
42,
with
the
first
full
paragraph?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
request
such
as
the
prevalent
in
the
subpoena
constitutes
the
wholesale
invasion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
so
forth
that
it's
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
didn't
refuse
that
or
he
never
did
actually
refuse
to
doing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
careful
not
to
refuse
as
i
read
the
records.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
and
he
argued
--
he
was
arguing
with
them
that
they
shouldn't
make
him
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
the
record,
he
did
not
refuse
at
anytime
each
time
they
would
--
put
those
words
in
his
mouth,
he
was
disdained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
said
so
clear
maybe
that
they
have
been
contempt.
but
how
you
said
so
clear,
what
you
have
in
a
situation
when
a
man
objects,
he
did
on
35,000
names
which
we
don't
know
whether
they
had
to
cuff
him
or
whether
they
had
to
bring
him
up
in
his
automobile,
or
how
they
bring
about.
he
objects
on
the
ground
that
that's
a
non
--
which
conveyed
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
may
or
may
not
be
applicable.
the
chairman,
as
one
would
(inaudible)
have
to
do,
treated
the
matter
seriously
and
discussed
it
with
them.
they
continued
to
discussed
it
and
the
chairman
took
the
view
of
it
and
finally
said
that,
"well,
you
can
have
10
more
days."
it's
surprising
that
was
not
--
not
proper
proceedings
for
any
court
or
committee,
in
connection
with
an
objection
generally
raised
on
what
is
not
claimed
and
out
of
frivolous
terms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
it
was
not
--
it
was
frivolous
on
this.
i've
known
for
a
certain
subpoenas,
it
required
a
tough
law
to
bring
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
papers.
a
man
would
sometimes
raise
objection
to
say,
"that's
too
much.
it
cost
me
too
much.
it's
withdrawn
and
so
forth
and
so
forth."
and
objection
could
be
made
on
a
genuine
and
sincere
basis.
now,
i
suppose
if
--
if
the
thing
of
this
kind
had
occurred,
the
man
has
been
asked
to
bring
up
that
notice,
he
came
up
and
said
that
as
he
did,
"i
--
i
want
to
discuss
the
issue
is
invading,
like,
he's
going
further,
and
you
have
a
right
to
do."
he
wouldn't
be
in
contempt
because
he
didn't
bring
them
up
before
he
had
a
right
to
discuss
that
order
now,
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
how
much
this
was.
i
don't
know
how
long
it
would
have
taken,
how
much
it
would've
cost,
a
copy
of
35,000
names.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
--
but
he
--
he
advanced
the
objection
--
the
fourth
amendment
objection
which
is
a
pretty
broad
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
treated
by
the
chairman
as
a
--
as
a
genuine
objection
as
one
would
expect
that
chairman
to
do.
and
they
had
a
discussion
about
it.
and
why
--
why
can
you
say
and
maybe
it's
true
but
why
can
you
say
that
under
those
circumstances
there
is
clear
contempt
already
committed.
but
what
he
has
done
is
to
raise
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
failure
to
say
and
declining
to
refuse
to
bargain
but
continued
to
argue
with
the
committee
that
they
shouldn't
bring
them
on
--
should
require
under
law
when
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
took
the
chance
of
making
an
objection
which
was
perfectly
a
legitimate
objection.
it's
not
frivolous,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
--
well,
of
course
if
its
true
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
not
a
game
in
objection.
that
that
--
i
can
understand
the
basis
of
your
argument
that
you're
making
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
it
unless
