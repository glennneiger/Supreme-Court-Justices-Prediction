justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
mean
that
if
a
subpoena
is
returnable
on
a
given
date,
the
--
assuming
as
i
do
for
the
purpose
of
discretion,
authorizing
--
issuing
tribunal
whether
a
court
or
an
administrative
agency,
a
current
committee
can
say
what
we've
asked,
have
it
--
it
takes
more
time
to
be
assembled
and
therefore,
we'll
be
able
to
bring
this
up
10
days
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
nature
of
the
infirmity
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
nature
of
the
infirmity,
what
is
formed
in
the
extension?
suppose
it
is
an
extension,
what
is
the
infirmity
in
that
--
assuming
the
tribunal
has
jurisdictions,
has
power
to
ask
for
what
was
asked
in
the
subpoena
and
a
return
was
made
on
the
return
date,
what
is
the
infirmity
of
the
tribunal
saying,
"i
now
see
it
takes
more
time
than
i
thought
or
we
thought."
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
--
but
you
said
that's
one
of
the
points
you've
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
infirmity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
the
--
is
the
indictment
made
as
a
contempt
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap).
if
he
says,
"i'm
not
going
to
produce
any
of
it,"
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
return
date
evaporates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
--
that's
the
question.
but
the
mere
fact
that
there's
an
extension,
i
got
the
impression
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
makes
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
what
he
does
that
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
merely
because
there's
an
extension
for
the
fulfillment
of
the
order
doesn't
aide
as
we
know
infirmity
and
that
will
be,
doesn't
preclude
this
--
his
having
been
guilty
but
subsequently
there
on
that
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
your
quick
answer
because
that's
one
of
your
points.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you've
heard
about
that
mr.
rein,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we
don't
have
to
go
in
to
these
far-reaching
sessions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
going
to
draw
the
deduction
that
i
would
draw
from
your
answer
namely
that's
the
piece
to
dispose
off
first?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
you
should
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you're
right
about
that,
you're
confident
that
you're
right,
that's
--
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
mean
you
shouldn't
argue
with
the
other
points.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
going
to
start
with
the
biggest
point,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
constitutional
point,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
first
one
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
failure
to
disclose
--
the
failure
to
disclose
the
subject
matter,
therefore
he
has
the
right
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
because
the
first
amendment,
from
your
point
of
view
protected
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rein,
may
i
ask
you,
putting
to
one
side
explicitness,
appropriate
explicitness
of
congressional
purpose
and
putting
to
one
side
the
question
of
authorization
of
the
questioning
committee
quorum,
all
of
it
there.
assume
they're
all
satisfied.
what
do
you
concede
to
be
the
limits
of
power
of
congress
in
appropriate
committee
inquire
into
them
the
security
act
that
congress
has
passed
in
order
to
ask
the
names
whether,
(a)
it
should
repeal
it
or
whether
(b),
should
extend
it
or
modify
it.
what
kind
of
scope
does
a
committee
of
congress
if
it
had
rested
at
those
--
to
those
that
i
concede
to
be
clearly
legislative
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
need
to
find
out
--
we
need
to
find
out
so
that
may
be
specific.
did
find
out
whether
the
whole
security
act
as
a
utility
in
the
sense
that
it's
addressing
itself
to
non-existing
evil
or
can
it
find
out
whether
the
security
act
isn't
tight
enough
or
extensive
enough
or
intensive
enough
because
the
evil
is
greater
than
congress
had
inspected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
go
to
those
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
that
--
can
it
go
and
explore
to
what
extent,
there
is
whatever
subversion
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
phrase
where
it
say,
congress
can't
consider
the
problem
with
subversion
to
take
us
very
far.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you're
speaking
the
power
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
indicated
a
while
ago
that
--
shut
off,
you
used
some
phrase
under
the
watkins
opinion
that
is
not
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
go
into
these
problems.
is
it
beyond
the
power
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
the
united
states,
the
watkins'
case
barred
congress
in
doing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
assuming
--
assume
the
resolution
is
sufficiently
different
so
there
is
no
(inaudible)
on
that
fall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
supposing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
take
my
--
take
my
hypothesis.
if
congress
bears
an
explicit
language,
"we
have
now
in
the
books
of
the
statute
at
large,
the
statute
dealing
with
national
security
to
disregard
to
various
aspects
of
what
most
colloquially
i
call
disloyalty,
subversion.
we
want
to
find
out
whether
this
is
a
needless
statute
or
whether
it's
an
inadequate
statute.
that
would
be
an
explicit
purpose
over
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
be
explicit
enough?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
the
area
of
subject
matter
not
the
specific
question.
could
they
--
could
they
try
to
find
out
whether
there's
any
achievement
for
any
such
statutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
in
order
to
find
out
how
they
would
have
to
find
out
whether
there
are
such
things
as
subversives,
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
subversive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
doesn't
that
open
up
an
area
of
examination
pretty
broad
to
find
out?
how
can
you
find
out
subjectively
unless
you
can
find
out
that
there
are
subversives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rein,
i'm
not
suggesting
myself
to
the
specific
questions.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
in
the
argument
what
your
arguing
is,
the
scope
of
congressional
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
me,
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
are
discussing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
mere
question
is
--
if
the
mere
question
is
whether
35,000
was
too
large
in
effect,
if
they'd
been
asked
to
produce
the
list
of
the
500
(inaudible)
of
the
50
members.
if
you're
going
to
the
question
of
35,000,
then
you
reach
the
problem
that
justice
whittaker
posed
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
--
do
not
take
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
making
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
excessiveness
of
the
subpoena
which
is
the
mere
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
imagination
is
equal
to
excluding
the
possible
relevance
even
to
such
an
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
entirely
on
that.
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
claim
mine
did
extend.
i
said
my
imagination
isn't
equal
to
fencing
off
congress
absolutely
and
saying
it's
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
subversiveness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it's
our
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
business
here
to
indulge
in
abstract
fencing
of
a
subject
to
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rein,
i
think
you
have
only
a
very
little
time
left.
may
i
ask
you
to
reserve
enough
of
it
to
document
a
statement
you
made
earlier
that
it
is
both
against
the
senate
rules
and
the
rules
of
this
subcommittee
violated
both
the
senate
rules
and
the
rules
of
this
subcommittee
presented
to
watkins
as
a
one-man
subcommittee
who
have
been
empowered
through
(inaudible)
i
hope
you
speak
to
that
before
you
sit
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
not,
just
the
reference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
give
us
the
references
to
those
rules
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
both
the
senate
and
the
subcommittee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
--
i
maybe
wrong.
i
quickly
glanced
over
the
pages
and
at
the
brief
but
i
don't
find
reference
of
the
discussion
which
you
have
said,
who
was
it,
senator
hayden
or
somebody,
senator
hayden?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
in
other
words
-–
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
saying
that
you
think
that
that
(b)
merely
makes
a
single
member
practically
a
master
without
power
to
rule
on
the
testimony
it
makes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
be
sure
what
happened
to
be
there,
much
of
his
problem
and
i
was
of
the
courts
in
christoffel.
does
this
mean
that
a
single
senator
can't
pass
on
relevance
of
questions
asked,
but
--
but
that
he
can't
act
--
can't
pass
on
objections
to
the
entire
subpoena
or
the
scope
of
subpoena?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
if
i
look
at
this
debate
on
48-49,
i'll
find
that
verified
or
indicated
by
what
it
said
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
on,
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
hold
you
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
minute
that
you
will
go
--
you
said
that
the
defendant
petitioned
in
this
case
may
have
certain
equity
impression.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
this
to
you
mr.
hitz.
what
you
call
(inaudible)
maybe
such
an
ambiguous
statement,
such
an
ambiguous
expression
of
the
command
that
the
witness
may
well
reasonably
will,
i
suppose
that
he's
given
those
10
days
and
that
the
act
hasn't
fallen
at
the
minute
when
senator
watkins
had
issued
the
--
issued
the
order,
let
me
say,
that
is
the
order
now
because
that
to
which
justice
brennan
has
asked,
that
is
the
order
now
but
he
didn't
stand,
tap
it
by
means
of
altruisms
on
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
9
of
your
brief.
the
colloquy
between
senator
watkinson
and
the
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
excuse
me,
i
beg
your
pardon,
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
9
and
10.
now,
he
doesn't
stop,
that
thing
didn't
stopped
there,
there
some
more
colloquy
and
then
senator
watkins
says,
"that
is
the
order
and
of
course
you
will
have
to
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
if
at
the
end
of
the
term
you
have
not
produced
them."
now,
i
assume
that's
the
correct
transcription
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'd
say,
and
i
put
this
to
you
in
order
to
elicit
an
answer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hypothetically.
i'm
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
think
to
exact
fastidious
accuracy
of
language
from
members
of
the
senate
or
members
of
the
house
when
engaged
in
this
kind
of
thing.
but
if
senator
watkins
says
was
then,
"that
is
the
order.
you've
had
ample
time
to
produce
these
arguments.
you
come
here
rejecting
our
authority
or
saving
our
authority.
i
grant
--
take
that
into
a
refusal
to
obey
this
(inaudible)
and
therefore,
we
shall
be
compelled
and
refer
the
case
of
the
united
states
attorney,"
or
some
such
language.
there's
some
such
in
the
case.
instead
of
asking
since
that
is
the
order,
you
could
produce
this,
give
him
10
days
more,
and
he
said
--
and
if
--
that
at
the
end
of
term
you
have
not
produce
them,
we'll
then
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary.
now,
i
put
it
and
since
the
statute
itself
must
call
for
a
wilful
disobedience,
a
willful
disobedience,
is
this
--
isn't
this
an
ambiguous
incident.
isn't
the
incident
ambiguous
on
the
minds
of
the
witness
that
he
may
well
absorb
the
situation
where
if
that's
the
judgment
to
mr.
rein
earlier
that
this
was
an
extension
of
the
period
within
which
to
comply.
and
if
it
is
ambiguous,
and
i
take
it
the
case
before
is
not
being
a
willful
disobedience.
i'd
like
your
comment
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
chairman,
he
might
--
the
chairman
may
change
his
mind
to
qualify
it
or
modify
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
incapable
at
the
end
of
10
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
but
--
but
a
witness
even
in
contempt
proceedings
and
hearings
and
you
know
much
more
about
that
than
i
do,
you
really
give
him
a
notice
for
(inaudible)
you
give
him
a
chance
to
change
his
mind
and
different
chairman
and
having
senator
watkins
some
part
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
comply
to
persuade
witnesses
not
to
adhere
to
their
accountable
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
may
have
had
maneuvering
grounds.
first,
if
he
had
said,
if
that's
in
his
last
--
the
last
amount
that
senator
watkins
that
the
order
is,
if
that
is
the
order
and
of
course
we
will
have
to
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
if
at
the
end
of
the
time
you
have
not
produced
them.
if
the
witness
had
conveyed
in
whatever
language
however,
susceptible
or
vague
or
abstraction,
that
is
(inaudible)
if
he
had
said,
"senator,
it's
no
use
of
giving
your
--
giving
me
this
order.
i
stand
on
the
objective
nature
of
the
subpoena
and
i
will
appear
to
them
10
days
hence.
now
that
for
me
would
be
a
contemporaneous
rejection
of
what
senator
watkins
commanded
for
the
future.
but
he
then,
drawing
this
note,
we
give
you
10
days
and
we'll
then
decide
what
to
do
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
and
as
to
this
view,
in
the
suggestion
of
10
days
is
a
--
was
a
--
quite
a
futile
thing
for
senator
watkins
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
there's
no
question
that
it
still
turned
out.
it
still
turned
out
but
even
they
had
some
purpose,
they're
not
saying
--
they're
not
stopping
where
you
said
the
contempt
was
complete.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
he
didn't
stop
there
because
he
said
even
at
that
--
if
it's
stopped
there,
if
he
stopped
there
then
there
would
be
no
problem
here
on
this
aspect
of
the
case.
he
didn't
stop
then
for
some
reason
of
his
own.
he
then
gave
him
10
days
more
presumably.
i
don't
think
one
could
give
too
much
for
senator
watkins
presumably
because
he
thought
the
witness
might
change
his
mind
and
would
obey
within
10
days.
and
all
i'm
putting
to
you
is
the
weight
of
the
consideration,
the
question
for
all
the
contempt
was
completed
in
the
--
in
the
complete
statement
of
the
record.
it
was
a
kind
of
an
ambulatory
performance.
he
didn't
stop
there.
he
went
on,
and
he
went
on
and
he
finally
said
well,
"well,
we'll
give
you
10
days
and
if
then
you
don't
have
it,
ifd
then
you
don't
produce,
we'll
consider
what
steps
we'll
take.
therefore,
i
think
--
to
me,
this
is
a
case
where
the
chairman
did
qualify
at
least
left
enough
with
an
impression
on
the
witness
to
infer
that
he
did
qualify
and
gave
him
the
10
days.
and
so
the
question
is
since
the
prosecution
did
--
does
turn
on
the
contempt
on
the
fifth,
that's
correct,
isn't
it,
mr.
hitz?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
view
of
the
charge
and
all
the
rest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
the
question
here
is
one
of
criminal
procedure
really
and
making
out
of
case
in
view
of
this
kind
of
a
record
that
there
was
a
willful
disobedience
concluded
on
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hitz.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
he
did
not
have
power
to
change
the
subpoena,
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
flaxer
but
as
to
the
senator
--
i
thought
--
evidently
i
misheard.
i
misunderstood.
i
though
you
said
senator
watkins
had
no
power
to
change
the
terms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
be
true,
i
want
to
ask
you
but
surely
he
would
have
power
to
extend
the
time
for
compliance,
wouldn't
he,
if
he
--
if
he's
given
this
one
man
power
under
the
new
--
under
the
changed
resolution
of
chairman
(inaudible)
i
can't
imagine
that
he
was
denying
the
implied
power
of
--
when
a
witness
appears
before
him
and
say
“very
well,
you
couldn't
or
one
reason
or
other
comeback
next
monday.”
wouldn't
he
have
that
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
he
could
have
been
overruled
also
on
his
ruling
that
the
claims
(inaudible)
than
he
could.
he
could
have
been
--
he
could
be
overruled
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
the
whole
point
of
delegating
power
into
a
single
member
to
change
the
revision
of
the
rules
was
to
make
him
for
all
practical
working
purposes
of
the
state,
the
boss
of
the
inquiry.
