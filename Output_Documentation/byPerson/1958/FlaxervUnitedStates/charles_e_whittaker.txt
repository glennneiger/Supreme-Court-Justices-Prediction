justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
he
resist
the
subpoena
on
that
ground,
mr.
rein?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
there
--
was
there
a
time
intervening
between
the
date
of
service
and
the
return
date
in
which
to
have
prepared
the
list?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
know
offhand
the
date
of
service?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
were
the
government
being
an
abstraction,
it
have
to
get
it
through
its
legislative
agency?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wasn't
referring
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
the
matter
of
whether
they
might
lawfully
do
it.
i
was
referring
to
the
means,
the
mechanics,
how
could
the
government
in
the
abstraction
obtain
information
except
through
agents?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
thereby
obtain
information?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
provided
for
by
the
subpoena?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
i
misunderstood
you
on
it
because
you
said,
he
erred
in
equating
himself
with
the
government.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
would
imply
even
to
a
small
group,
the
theory
as
i
get
from
the
objection
here,
it
was
not
on
account
of
the
--
being
the
first
department
is,
but
it
was
objection
to
--
a
violation
of
the
right
to
privacy
if
any
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
in
subpoena,
if
--
but
to
have
a
list
from
that,
you
must
--
you
object
on
that
ground,
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
wasn't
it
because
it
did
that
or
is
it
because
it
has
violated
the
right
to
privacy?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
have
been
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
does
he
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
he
do
that
without
inspection
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
didn't
say
why?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
position
is
that
here,
and
to
the
fact
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
and
the
word
is
not
just
to
your
argument,
that
what
was
said
about
mr.
flaxer
at
that
time
can't
be
treated
as
a
motion
to
quash?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it's
just
for
the
motion
to
quash
it,
and
that
would
mean,
what
was
being
inquired.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
do
you
suggest
mr.
hitz
as
to
the
question,
exactly
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
prompt
you
to
proceed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
on
the
return
date,
he
appeared
this
client
and
has
filed
(inaudible)
the
court
does
give
it.
after
doing
so,
he
denies
the
motion.
the
court
says,
"you
don't
have
to
comply
with
that.
have
to
give
you
10
days
more
within
which
you
comply."
now,
has
the
contempt
of
the
subpoena
been
committed
on
that
determination?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
he
doesn't?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
he
assume
that
the
court
will
give
him
additional
time
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
if
he
overruled
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
having
gotten
that
reaffirmed
side
does
not
immunize
an
otherwise
possible
contempt.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
he
either
come
in
with
objections
in
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
the
courts
passed
one
at
that
time,
your
motion
is
denied
but
i'm
--
instead
of
holding
you
in
contempt
now,
i
give
you
10
days
more.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
has
it
commenced
a
contempt
to
be
submitted
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
