mr.
caplan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
language
in
the
statute
that
you
--
you
lean
on
to
come
to
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
make
the
distinction
between
what
it
must
withhold
if
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
this
statute.
the
statute
you've
been
reading.
how
do
you
conclude
--
is
there
language
saying
that
in
one
instance,
he
--
he
must
withhold
and
in
the
other
he
--
he
need
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
ask
and
as
you
--
at
the
outset
of
your
argument,
you
made
a
distinction
in
that
--
these
delinquent
taxes
for
--
for
on
income
from
activities
disassociated
from
the
state.
may
i
ask
if
you
make
any
--
do
make
any
distinction
between
the
right
of
--
of
the
auditor
to
pay
them
their
salaries,
not
withstanding
a
lien.
if
the
lien
was
on
failure
to
pay
income
on
their
taxes
on
their
--
on
their
salaries.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
earned
in
state
employment
and
--
as
distinguished
from
these
catering
services
that
you
were
speaking
of.
you
--
you
mentioned
that
factor
in
your
argument
that
these
were
not
--
was
not
on
salaries
earned
from
a
state.
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
the
--
the
state
auditor
could
withhold
or
--
or
could
refuse
to
withhold
for
the
government
the
wages
that
were
paid
even
though
they
were
delinquent
to
the
government
on
their
salaries.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
yes,
well,
let's
talk
just
about
the
federal
statutes.
do
you
make
no
distinction
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
said
at
the
outset
that
this
--
this
man
with
others
was
in
the
catering
business
and
that
the
taxes
due
or
due
on
his
income
from
that
catering
business
and
that
it
was
not
--
the
taxes
were
not
due
on
any
moneys
earned
from
the
state.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
do
you
make
a
distinction
in
the
power
of
the
--
of
the
state
auditor
to
ignore
the
--
the
lien
in
these
two
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
graney.
chief
justice
earl
warren

well.
we'll
recess
now.
