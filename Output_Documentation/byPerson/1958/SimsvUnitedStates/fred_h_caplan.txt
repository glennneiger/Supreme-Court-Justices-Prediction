mr.
fred
h.
caplan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
edgar
b.
sims,
who
was
the
auditor
of
the
state
of
west
virginia,
has
been
subjected
to
personal
liability
under
the
penal
provisions
of
section
6332
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
to
better
clarify
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
sections
6331
and
6332
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
may
be
found
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
appendix
on
pages
1a
or
a1
and
a2.
section
6331
of
the
code
authorizes
the
secretary
the
--
that
is
the
secretary
of
the
treasurer
to
collect
delinquent
taxes
by
levy
upon
all
the
property
of
the
taxpayer.
section
6332
provides
for
the
surrender
of
that
property,
and
there
is
a
penalty
provision
in
that
section.
because
this
entire
case
is
based
upon
this
particular
section,
i
ask
the
court's
indulgence
while
i
quote
briefly
from
section
6332.
it
is
stated
therein
in
subsection
(a)
under
requirement,
“any
person
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to
property
or
rights
to
property
subject
to
levy
upon
which
a
levy
has
been
made
shall,
upon
demand
of
the
secretary
or
his
delegate,
surrender
such
property
or
rights
or
discharge
such
obligation
to
the
secretary
or
his
delegate.”
in
(b)
of
that
section
entitled
“penalty
for
violation,”
it
stated,
“any
person
who
fails
or
refuses
as
required
by
subsection
(a)
any
property
or
rights
to
property,
subject
to
levy,
upon
demand
by
the
secretary
or
his
delegate,
shall
be
liable
in
his
own
person
and
estate
to
the
united
states
in
a
sum
equal
to
the
value
of
the
property
or
rights
not
so
surrendered.”
now,
the
issue,
the
principle
issue
here
at
this
time
is
whether
this
petitioner
should
be
held
personally
liable
for
the
consequences
of
his
acts
performed
in
the
line
of
his
official
duties
as
auditor
of
the
state
of
west
virginia.
there
are,
of
course,
many
sub
questions
which
must
be
discussed
and
answered.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
here
this
morning
that
the
state
is
not
a
person,
nor
is
this
petitioner
a
person
within
the
contemplation
of
section
6332
and
that
he
could
not
therefore
be
held
personally
and
individually
liable
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
that
section.
it
is
further
contended
here
by
the
petitioner
that
the
broad
general
rule
of
law
that
a
public
officer
should
not
be
held
personally
liable
for
the
consequences
of
his
acts
when
performed
in
the
official
line
of
duties
--
of
his
duties
as
such
public
officer.
now,
the
lower
courts
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
your
honor,
it
is
my
thought
that
the
primary
question
here
is
of
statutory
construction.
yes,
sir.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
held
in
effect
that
this
petitioner
and
the
state
were
included
in
the
term
person
and
therefore,
entered
a
judgment
against
him.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
this
judgment.
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
thereafter.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
complicated.
there
was
no
hearing,
they
are
stipulated
and
are
found
in
the
record.
but
the
fact
show
that
certain
state
employees
on
the
state
of
west
virginia
were
engaged
in
endeavors
entirely
separate
on
the
part
from
their
state
employment.
that
apparently
was
during
the
after-hours
from
such
employment
in
--
well,
it
isn't
shown
in
the
record
to
clarify.
it
appeared
that
certain
state
employees
had
engaged
in
catering
services
and
that
sort
of
thing
after
hours
during
the
evening
time.
that
they
gain
--
earned
incomes
due
to
such
outside
employment
and
that
they
did
not,
apparently
pay
any
federal
income
tax
on
this
income
so
earned.
this
is
mentioned
expressly
for
the
purpose
to
show
that
no
taxes
on
any
income
earned
in
their
state
employment
is
involved
here.
that
of
course
was
withheld
in
accordance
with
law
and
was
submitted
to
the
internal
revenue.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
that
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
that
is
withheld
by
the
auditor
under
a
statute
of
the
state.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
that
--
that
the
auditor
of
the
state
would
be
subjected.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
think
that
is
in
the
pertinent
consideration,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
in
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
do
you
refer,
your
honor,
to
the
state
statute
or
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
know
of
no
such
language
which
would
distinguish
this
except
that
this
is
--
and
i
haven't
considered
that
particularly
for
the
reason
that
this
is
a
statute
having
to
do
with
delinquent
taxes
for
the
non-payment
of
delinquent
taxes
and
a
levy
served
pursuant
to
the
failure
to
pay.
the
question
of
withholding
tax
has
never
been
raised,
that
i
know
of.
it
has
been
withheld
as
a
matter
of
course.
and
i
do
not,
your
honor
know
of
any
language
which
would
make
that
distinction
here.
now,
i
stated
these
employees
having
failed
to
pay
their
income
--
such
income
tax
after
demands
were
made
and
after
their
contingent
failure
to
pay.
a
levy
as
provided
in
section
6331
was
served
upon
the
state
of
west
virginia
demanding
that
any
wages
due
the
taxpayer
be
turned
over
to
the
director
of
the
district
--
district
director
of
internal
revenue.
now,
these
levies
were
addressed
to
the
state
of
west
virginia
as
the
person
in
possession
of
the
property
and
so
forth.
and
in
every
instance
were
served
upon
edgar
b.
sims,
auditor
of
the
state
of
west
virginia.
now,
mr.
sims,
after
receiving
or
being
served
with
such
levies
consulted
with
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
and
we
do
not,
your
honors,
as
may
have
been
indicated,
we
do
not
rely
upon
that
as
justifying
the
action
of
the
auditor.
we
do
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
--
because
he
consulted
with
the
attorney
general
that
he
is
justified.
but
we
do
believe
that
it
shows
his
sincerity
and
his
honest
desire
to
determine
this
question.
and
after
so
consulting
and
exercising
the
discretion,
he
believed
with
--
he
was
entitled
to
exercise,
he
refused
to
honor
the
levies
and
did
pay
the
money
over
to
the
--
the
wages
due
this
--
the
tax
payers,
two
such
tax
payers.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
no,
your
honor
there
was
not.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
you
mean
the
salaries
earned
in
state
employment?
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes
sir,
i
see
in
this
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
that
--
that
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
are
owned
by
reason
of
the
fact
of
a
state
statute
which
are
specifically
authorized.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
now,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
i
--
but
i
quite
follow
you.
i
want
to
be
sure.
now,
you
make
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
the
--
i
--
i
see
no
distinction
there,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
law
merely,
there
in
the
section
involved
merely
pertains
to
delinquent
taxes.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
after
the
auditor,
mr.
sims,
had
refused
to
honor
these
levies.
the
united
states
government
instituted
a
suit
against
the
auditor
of
the
state
and
against
mr.
sims
individually.
wherein,
it
sought
to
impose
the
penalty
contained
in
section
6332
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
upon
the
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
suit
instituted
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
to
west
virginia,
the
auditor
was
dismissed
as
a
party
by
the
court,
but
the
action
was
maintained
against
mr.
sims
in
his
individual
capacity.
i
will
state
it
here,
we
believe
at
this
point
that
the
principle
issue
is
whether
mr.
sims
is
--
should
be
held
individually
and
personally
liable
under
the
penal
provisions
of
section
6332
(b)
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
first
point
which
we
desired
to
make
before
this
court
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
term
person
as
used
in
the
statutes
here
involved.
as
stated,
we
contend
that
the
term
person
as
used
in
section
6332
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
does
not
include
a
state.
we
believe
that
it
is
most
pertinent
to
the
consideration
of
this
entire
question
that
in
the
language
of
this
section
whether
it'd
be
6332
(a),
(b),
or
(c).
nowhere
therein
is
the
term
state
mentioned
nor
an
officer
or
employee
thereof,
while
other
persons
and
entities
are
mentioned.
it
is
necessary
of
course
to
consider
then
what
the
term
person
means
and
includes
as
used
in
this
section.
we
turn
to
subsection
(c)
of
6332
and
we
find
the
definition
of
'person'.
person
there,
and
we
acknowledge
that
the
term
is
--
includes.
it
is
stated
that
the
term
“person”
includes
an
officer
or
employee
of
a
corporation.
a
--
and
a
member
or
employee
of
a
partnership
who
has
such
officer
or
employee
has
possession
of
the
property
and
so
forth.
now,
in
26
or
in
the
internal
revenue
code
at
section
7701,
definitions
are
contained
there
of
terms
for
the
terms
used
anywhere
throughout
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
term
“person”
is
there
again
and
generally
defined.
now,
that
section
states
that
the
term
“person”
shall
be
construed
to
mean
and
include
an
individual,
a
trust
and
estate,
that's
e-s-t-a-t-e,
a
partnership,
association,
company
or
corporation.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
but
it
is
cited
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
may
--
i
currently
--
i
have
it
cited
on
--
on
several
places
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
don't
know
but
i
have
it
quoted.
i
have
it
quoted
on
page
6,
the
part
that
i
have
read.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
page
6
of
our
brief.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
as
stated
it's
noted
therein,
in
considering
both
of
these
definitions
that
nowhere
is
the
state,
nor
an
officer
or
employee
thereof
included.
and
this
latter
section
7701
pertains
to
the
term
“person”
wherever
used
throughout
the
entire
internal
revenue
code
unless
otherwise
specifically
indicated.
now,
we
contend
your
honors
that
the
language
here
stating
person,
stating
individual,
stating
trust,
estate,
partnership,
association,
company,
and
officers
or
employees
thereof
is
clear
and
that
the
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous
and
therefore,
is
not
in
need
of
interpretation
or
addition.
there
is
no
necessity
of
construction
of
this
because
there
is
a
covered
list
and
the
state
is
not
included
in
that
covered
list.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
no,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
the
--
in
7701,
individual
is
mentioned,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
we
believe
that
the
language
of
such
statute
should
be
read
as
it
is
and
should
not
be
construed
to
mean
what
an
administrator
or
even
a
court
thinks
that
congress
intended
for
it
to
mean.
now,
both
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
readily
acknowledged
that
neither
the
state
nor
an
officer
employee
thereof
was
mentioned
in
these
sections.
and
in
fact,
they
expressed
some
concern
about
it.
i
quote
from
the
memorandum
of
opinion
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
which
may
be
found
in
the
transcript
of
record
on
page
26,
and
i
will
quote
briefly.
and
the
court
said
in
relation
to
the
--
to
the
fact
that
the
term
--
that
word
“state”
is
not
included
in
the
term
“person”.
he
said,
“well,
i
am
somewhat
disturbed
by
the
provisions
of
section
6332
(c),
defining
a
person
and
that
it
does
not
mention
officers
or
employees
of
a
state.
i
think
that
there
might
be
a
valid
argument
that
in
not
mentioning
them,
they
were
intended
to
be
excluded.
but
that
would
lead,
as
i
view
it,
to
a
very
illogical
and
unreasonable
result.”
those
are
the
words
of
the
united
states
district
court
and
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
view.
now,
this
court,
this
honorable
court
has
very
forcefully
commented
on
that
sort
of
reasoning.
in
crooks
versus
harrelson
in
page
--
in
282
united
states
which
is
mentioned
in
our
brief
at
page
--
pages
7
and
8,
the
court
in
very
forceful
language
stated
that
great
caution
must
be
exercised
in
rejecting
the
literal
meaning
of
a
statute
in
favor
of
a
construction
in
harmony
with
a
supposed
spirit
and
purpose
thereof.
and,
in
so
many
words,
the
court
had
this
to
say,
i
will
not
--
of
course
burden
the
court
with
a
quote
of
the
entire
section
in
my
brief.
that
the
court
said
that,
“laws
enacted
with
good
intention
when
put
to
the
test
frequently
and
to
the
surprise
of
the
lawmaker
himself,
turn
out
to
be
mischievous,
absurd
or
otherwise
objectionable.
but
in
such
case,
the
remedy
lies
with
the
lawmaking
authority
and
not
with
the
courts.”
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
in
the
instant
case,
should
the
court
have
read
words
into
the
statute
merely
because
of
a
supposed
absurdity.
if
the
statute
is
absurd,
is
it
not
up
to
congress
to
correct
the
statute.
now,
we
believe
as
we
stated,
that
the
state
is
not
included
in
this
term
“person”.
but
we
further
know
that
there
are
several
factors
which
must
be
considered
in
determining
that.
one
of
course,
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
section
involve,
that
is
again
section
6332.
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
an
examination
of
the
legislative
history
fails
to
reveal
that
congress
intended
for
its
provisions
to
relate
to
a
state.
the
internal
revenue
code
has
been
revised
many
times
over
a
period
of
many
years.
i
think
of
three
in
particular,
back
as
far
as
1926,
1939,
and
the
last
great
overhaul
as
you
may
call
it,
in
1954.
although
it
was
amended
and
revised
many
times,
the
--
basically,
the
same
language
has
been
retained
in
relation
to
the
statutes
here
involved.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
by
constitutional
amendment
in
the
1930's,
they
suggest
the
execution
was
permitted.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
no,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
no,
your
honor.
and
we
would
be
very
happy
for
the
government
to
exercise
its
authority
under
those
statutes
and
proceed
by
--
suggest
the
execution.
it
certainly
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
he
would
have
to
bring
a
suit
and
obtain
a
judgment
and
of
course,
comply
with
the
constitutional
provision
and
the
state
statutes
which
--
which
do
permit
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
treasury
regulation?
yes,
sir
--
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
am
not
certain.
i
believe
it
--
i
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
i
think
it
is
1955,
some
--
somewhere
along
there.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
prior
to
that,
i
believe,
your
honor,
there
was
a
ruling
that
state
salaries
were
not
subjected,
although
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
a
treasury
regulation.
i
think
it
was
a
--
an
internal
revenue
regulation
or
some
--
some
other
such
regulation
other
than
treasury.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
the
employees
are
still
there.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
oh,
i
really
don't
know,
your
honor.
sorry.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
under
--
under
our
statutes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
served
on
the
auditor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
know
of
no
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
you're
speaking,
your
honor,
under
the
federal
statute,
under
the
language.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
he
is,
your
honor,
by
virtue
of
the
state
statute
which
specifically
authorizes
and
--
and
designates
him
as
the
person
to
be
served
with
and
he
suggest
the
execution.
and
i
believe
that
he
would
be
subject
to
a
personal
suit
under
the
law
then,
if
there
were
a
judgment
and
if
there
were
the
necessary
suggesti
execution
proceedings.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
he
would,
your
honor,
under
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
statute
would
be
involved
in
the
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
by
virtue
of
the
state
statute,
he
is
obligated
with
respect
to
when
there
is
a
suggestive
execution
proceeding.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
pardon
me?
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
suggest
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
for
granting
error.
suggesti
execution.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
that
is
comparable
to
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
garnishment.
i
should
have
used
perhaps
the
word
garnishment,
although
our
statute
does
specifically
refer
to
suggesti
execution.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
he
would
under
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
he
would,
your
honor,
under
the
--
under
the
state
law.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
your
honor,
that
--
i
can
only
say
to
that,
that
we
do
not
agree
that
the
state
has
been
--
is
--
is
included
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
in
the
term
“person”.
and
not
being
included
would
not
be
touched
at
all
by
the
proceeding.
that
the
auditor
in
the
case
of
a
suggesti
execution,
for
example,
or
in
the
case
of
a
state
matter,
we
cannot
deny
and
we
do
not
deny
that
the
auditor
is
the
one
upon
whom
an
attachment
or
garnishment
shall
be
served.
and
that
it
is
--
is
his
obligation
to
pay
out
on
a
warrant
for
state
moneys
on
a
requisition.
in
that
respect,
there
have
been
numerous,
which
we
will
relate
to
later,
mandamus
actions
against
the
auditor.
in
every
instance,
however,
of
which
i
am
cognizant,
the
suit
has
been
against
the
auditor
for
the
--
to
force
him
to
honor
a
requisition
for
the
payment
of
state
moneys.
there
has
never
been,
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
determine,
any
attempt
to
sue
him
personally.
it
has
always
been
a
question
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
expenditure
of
state
moneys.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
and
we
--
we
believe
that
it
is
different.
and,
of
course,
in
this
instance,
we
are
now
concerned
with
mr.
sims
as
an
individual.
and,
of
course,
as
an
individual,
we
say
and
we
say
this
in
all
sincerity
that
mr.
sims,
as
an
individual,
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to
the
taxpayers'
wages.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
he
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
that
he
is
personally
liable
under
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
section
involved
here
that
he
would
be
an
officer
or
employee
of
a
corporation.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
the
--
the
case
--
your
case
of
the
officer
of
a
corporation,
i
would
say,
is
definitely
liable
under
the
language
of
the
statute
because
he
is
definitely
covered
in
the
definition
and
would
be
brought
within
the
language.
we
believe
that
the
--
the
auditor
of
the
state
is
not
within
the
language
of
the
statute
and
would
not
therefore
be
covered
by
the
statute.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
distinction
of
course
is,
and
we
make
a
distinction
between
an
officer
of
a
state
and
an
officer
of
a
corporation.
and
we
believe
that
there
--
that
it
is
a
valid
distinction.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
because,
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
of
--
excuse
me.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
because,
your
honor,
of
the
language
of
the
statute
wherein
an
officer
of
a
corporation
is
specifically
provided
as
a
person,
is
specifically
defined
--
defined
as
a
person.
in
other
words,
section
6332
(c)
defines
a
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
excuse
me.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
--
i
understood
before
you
to
say
that
he
was
the
treasurer
and
i
assumed
that
he
was
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
he
is
the
person
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to,
i
say
that
the
statute
specifically
covers
him.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
that
in
--
in
view
of
the
language
used,
that
it
may
have
a
--
a
literal
meaning.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
the
word
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
at
best
in
constructive
possession,
i
would
say
no
in
view
of
the
further
language
here
where
it
is
stated
in
or
obligated
with
respect
to.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
would
think
so.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
don't
believe
we
do,
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
full
language
of
that
where
it
says
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
he
has
it
whether
it's
constructive
or
actual.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
and
he
is
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
that's
actual.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
in
further
discussion
of
the
legislative
history,
i
call
the
attention
to
the
--
of
the
court
to
the
1954
amendment
of
the
internal
revenue
law
wherein
the
law
was
passed
basically
in
the
same
language
that
had
formally
been
contained,
except
that
in
section
6331
thereof,
it
provided
specifically,
that
how
this
levy
may
be
served
on
the
officers,
elected
officers
and
employees
of
the
federal
government
and
the
district
of
columbia.
whatever
the
reason
for
that
necessity
to
include
the
federal
government
expressly,
we
say
that
as
for
the
same
reason,
the
state
should
have
been
included
and
the
employees
thereof
so
included
so
that
there
could
have
been
no
question.
we
see
of
no
reason
why
the
congress
could
not
at
that
time
have
included
state
or
state
employees
if
it
had
so
desired.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
--
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
--
i
believe
the
--
if
the
auditor
refused
to
pay,
there
has
been,
of
course,
a
mandamus
available
to
force
payment
of
that.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
it
is
my
thought
that
that
would
go
to
--
to
the
entire
question
of
whether
or
not
a
public
official
is
liable.
and
i
--
i
believe
that
the
state
would
be
liable
under
that.
although,
the
state
cannot
be
sued
in
the
ordinary
circumstances
in
west
virginia,
but
the
state
would
be
liable,
i
believe.
and
if,
of
course,
the
auditor
had
done
something
fraudulently
or
illegally,
then
of
course,
he
would
be
personally
liable,
i
would
think.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
what
would
be
the
result
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
if
--
if
the
state
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
the
auditor
refused
to
pay
over
withholding
taxes?
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
no.
i
know
of
no
remedy
we'd
have
other
than
to
file
a
suit.
unless,
we
would
say
that
under
the
specific
west
virginia
statute,
the
auditor
is
expressly
included
and
expressly
designated
as
the
--
the
person
to
handle
this
withholding
taxes
and
would
definitely
be
the
custodian
of
those
taxes.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
the
--
the
federal
government
certainly
has
a
remedy
through
the
ordinary
course
of
law
bringing
suit
and
obtaining
a
judgment.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
oh,
your
speaking,
your
honor,
of
a
--
of
a
remedy
against
the
state?
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
know
of
no
suit
against
the
state
itself.
i
haven't
considered
that.
the
only
thing
i'd
consider,
of
course,
is
a
--
as
in
the
suit
against
the
delinquent
taxpayer.
i
don't
know
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
that
i
considered
there
in
--
involving
the
state
would
go
into
this
question
of
whether
or
not
a
state
is
a
person
under
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
statute.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
that
is
our
position,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
so,
to
bring
the
suit
against
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
say
that
it
doesn't
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
say
that
it
doesn't
apply.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
inapplicable
to
the
state.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
if
--
yes,
if
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
oh,
that
is
my
thought
that
it
would
be
more
--
more
of
a
general
suit,
not
under
that
statute.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
that
--
there
would
just
be
a
question
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
a
general
suit
for
a
wrong
committed
by
the
state
against
the
federal
government
and
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
we
were
speaking
of
delinquent
taxes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
we
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
we
may
find
ourselves
in
a
curious
situation,
your
honor,
and
that
we
have
not
claimed
that
a
lien
for
taxes
does
not
attach.
we
may
find
some
difficulty
in
a
method
of
--
of
enforcing
that
lien,
but
i
believe
that
we
do
not
claim
that
the
lien
does
not
--
does
not
attach
on
--
on
moneys
earned
by
state
employees
wherever
earned,
that
lien
would
attach.
but
under
the
penalty
provisions
here
involved,
we
--
we
just
take
the
position
that
the
state
is
not
included
in
the
term
“person”
and
that
the
liability
does
not
attach.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
a
lien
under
section
6321,
perhaps,
the
--
the
general
lien
statute
for
--
for
delinquent
taxes
which
is
on
page
81
of
our
brief.
now,
a
further
consideration
here
is
the
congressional
intent
of
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
and
we
believe
that
such
congressional
intent
should
be
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
enactment
and
not
by
the
influence
by
later
development.
and
if
a
later
development
necessitates
a
change,
then
it
should
be
brought
about
by
a
congressional
action
and
not
by
interpretation.
this
of
course,
being
one
of
the
very
principle
reasons
for
a
--
for
the
frequent
meetings
of
congress.
now,
this
--
this
language
which
is
--
is
contained
in
the
present
section,
was
in
this
section
in
1926.
and
at
that
time,
the
federal
government
did
not
even
look
to
state
employees
for
income
taxes.
but
the
same
language
was
there
and
the
definitions
were
the
same.
so
we
believe
that
that
is
indicative
of
the
congressional
intent
failing
to
show
that
states
or
employees
thereof
were
included.
now,
in
relation
to
this
question,
let
us
look
briefly
to
the
notice
of
levy
which
was
served
in
this
case.
and
we
note
that
the
notice
of
levy
was
served
upon
the
state
as
the
person
in
possession
of
the
property
and
so
forth
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
upon
the
state.
it
was
addressed
to
the
state
of
west
virginia
as
the
person.
it
must
be
remembered
again
that
the
state,
the
word
“state”
is
not
included
in
the
statute.
the
state
has
been
said
to
be
sui
generis
or
as
discussed
or
defined
in
black's
law
dictionary
as
one
of
its
own
kind,
or
the
only
one
of
its
kind,
or
peculiar.
it
is
a
separate
and
distinct
entity.
the
state
is
different
from
any
other
entity
and
of
necessity
must
be
afforded
separate
and
different
treatment.
now,
certainly
in
common
usage,
the
term
“person”
does
not
include
the
sovereign
state.
now,
we
realize
fully
well
that
there
are
exceptions
to
this
and
that
the
courts
have
on
occasion
and
in
many
occasions,
declared
the
state
to
be
a
person.
now,
the
government
has
cited
several
cases
in
its
brief
such
as
south
carolina
versus
united
states,
and
georgia
versus
--
georgia
versus
evans,
ohio
versus
helvering.
and
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
these
cases
are
distinguishable
from
the
case
at
bar,
and
that
in
those
cases
and
in
practically
all
of
the
cases
cited,
the
state
has
been
performing
a
proprietary
function
rather
than
a
governmental
function.
in
ohio
versus
helvering,
for
example,
it
was
a
case
of
the
federal
government
imposing
a
tax.
and
i
believe
this
was
an
injunction
suit
by
the
state
to
prevent
the
federal
government
from
imposing
us
to
pay
tax
on
the
state's
activity
of
selling
spirituous
liquors.
now,
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
state
was
a
person
because
it
was
engaged
in
business
in
competition
with
the
general
public.
and
when
it
sheds
its
cloak
of
--
its
governmental
cloak
for
that
of
a
proprietor,
it
sheds
any
immunity
which
it
may
have
had
of
this
nature.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
--
term
“ministerial
officer”.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
there
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
the
effect
--
well,
it
is
to
honor
a
requisition
for
the
expenditure
of
state
moneys.
that
has
been
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
then
it
would
be
a
ministerial
duty.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
now,
the
--
we
have
cited
in
our
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
well,
i
don't
know
if
he
goes
that
far.
they
--
they
have
in
our
state
as
a
requisition
which
is
presented
to
the
auditor
and
when
he
refuses
to
honor
that
requisition
a
mandamus
suit
is
--
has
often
been
instituted.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
if
he
had
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
he
would
--
could
be
subjected
--
subjected
to
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
thereby,
exercising
his
discretion
under
the
west
virginia
code
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
pay
that
money.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
say
under
the
--
i
--
i
--
that
is
what
we
say
the
way
the
statute
was
written,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
believe
that
he
could
be
compelled
to
if
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
yes
the
state
cannot
be
sued.
i
have
--
i
have
not
said
that,
your
honor.
i
believe.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
don't
say
that
the
state
cannot
be
sued.
i
think
it
has
been
very
well
proved
that
can.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
as
the
states
concerned?
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
the
federal
government
can
sue
it.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
in
a
--
i
believe
a
in
a
district
court
or
this
court
has
--
certainly
has
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
see
my
time
is
about
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
no,
your
honor.
i
merely
would
like
to
make
a
statement
in
relation
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i'm
not
familiar
with
it,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
since
1932.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
he
has
been
in
court
many
times.
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
and
i
might
say
in
passing,
your
honor,
if
i
may
that
mr.
sims,
while
having
been
in
court
many
times
on
mandamus
proceedings,
has
prevailed
--
and
also
prevailed
in
many
cases
as
well
as
having
many
writs
issued
against
him.
and
i
say
from
that
that
it
shows
that
there
is
a
discretionary
duty
on
his
part
in
expending
state
moneys.
that
it
is
not
generally
a
--
a
ministerial
duty
and
that
that
has
a
great
bearing
on
this
case
as
you
will
see
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
i
assume
i
--
mr.
fred
h.
caplan
thank
you.
