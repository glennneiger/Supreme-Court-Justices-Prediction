isn't
it?

yes,
i
found

but
i
couldn't

all
right,

justice

yes,
thank
you.
justice

suggesti.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
the
officer
by
this
corporation
to
be
individually
allowed
or
one
that
--
that
is
--
the
corporation
which
he
worked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
claiming
that
neither
the
state
nor
the
official
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
that
the
state
can
be
sued
for
this
particular
thing
if
he's
paid
it
out
wrongfully?
the
auditors
paid
it
out
wrongfully?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
paid
it
out
before
they
could
get
one,
would
the
state
be
liable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
is
the
--
what
would
be
the
result
of
your
arguments,
should
he
accept,
so
far
as
the
government
claims
against
state,
their
concern
for
taxes
where
the
government
seeks
to
hold
the
state
liable
for
its
wages
due
the
employee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
result
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
your
argument
should
be
accepted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
argument
would
be
accepted
that
these
federal
--
these
two
statutes,
for
this
statute,
does
not
apply
to
the
state
or
to
any
of
its
officials.
does
the
government
have
any
remedy
to
run
a
garnishment
except,
as
you
say,
first
to
file
a
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
getting
at,
are
you
claiming
the
federal
government
has
no
remedy
at
all
here
or
it
has
just
pursued
the
wrong
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
--
whether
they
want
to
collect
it
by
something
like
a
garnishment?
whether
you
call
it
that
or
something
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
if
it's
your
position
and
may
be
it's
right.
if
your
position
is
accepted
that
the
government
cannot
run
a
garnish,
but
to
get
a
lien
until
it
first
files
a
suit
and
then
gets
the
lien
on
the
controlling
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
some
kind
of
(voice
overlap)
--
what
--
what
are
the
consequences
of
that,
if
you're
right?
you
--
you
claim
that
the
federal
government
has
no
right
to
get
a
lien
by
notifying
him
under
this
because
the
state
is
not
a
person.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
assume
you're
relying
on
statements
that
have
been
made
a
number
of
times
that
unless
the
state
specifically
included?
it
shouldn't
be
read
into
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
result
would
be
then
that
the
government
has
no
--
can
get
no
lien
insofar
as
something
like
a
garnishment
is
concerned,
in
order
to
protect
itself
from
a
payment
by
the
state,
wages
to
a
delinquent
taxpayer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
that
could
be
done,
if
the
tax
law,
the
federal
tax
law
is
invalid
in
providing
a
lien
for
wages.
it's
just
not
applicable
to
a
state,
i
wonder
--
maybe
it's
--
i
have
thought
about
that
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
don't
undercut
that
kind
of
right
to
the
government
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
invalid
so
far
as
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
inapplicable,
maybe,
it's
a
better
word.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there'd
be
no
lien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
lien
so
there
could
be
no
liability
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
accruing
against
the
state,
i
assume,
until
it
file
a
suit
and
get
a
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
you
mean,
after
the
check
was
gone
and
he
got
that
check
in
his
position,
it's
properly
signed.
at
that
moment,
he
--
it
became
a
ministerial
duty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
has
paid
these
people
and
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
assume
your
answer
is
that
the
superior
authority
couldn't
claim
it
had
superior
authority
because
the
government
had
no
lien
on
it,
it
didn't
apply
to
your
--
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
you're
going
on
another
amendment
that
they
can't
--
state
can't
be
sued
in
part,
sounds
like
it.(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
attempt
of
yours
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
finally,
you
say
it
can
be
sued.
do
you
think
as
you
have
to
consent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
can
be
sued
without
a
consent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
whether
your
--
you
know
whether
your
case
has
yet
been
written
up
in
--
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
suit
is
not
based
on
the
idea
that
the
state
is
a
person
and
it's
not
against
a
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
statute
is
not
a
private
state
without
applying
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
only
--
what
you
have
sustained
here
is
the
idea
that
applies
to
the
auditor
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
that
it
applies
to
the
state,
applies
to
the
auditor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
creates
a
little
more
problem
to
me
for
you
to
hold
individually
about
it.
that's
the
whole
state
(inaudible)
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
not
preceded
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
covered,
(inaudible)
a
person,
do
you
think
he's
in
possession
of
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
he's
the
person
who's
in
possession
of
the
property
--
of
properties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
sure
you
can
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

not
obligated.
does
that
mean
a
person
who
owes
money
or
you
think
--
who
owes
him
the
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
of
virginia.
if
that's
to
be
read
as
applying
only
to
the
person
who
owes
the
money,
how
could
you
say
that
you
could
bring
this
action
against
the
officials?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
if
that
means
with
reference
(inaudible)
that
suppose
an
agent
is
the
person
who
owes
the
debt,
he's
liable
in
his
pretty
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
--
i
don't
think
--
it
seems
to
me
like
the
statute
(inaudible)
is
on
that
property,
isn't
he?
with
the
actual
property
that
the
person
has
in
possession,
not
a
debt
that
he
owes
the
state
of
the
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
he
doesn't
have
any
money
particularly
in
his
possession.
this
is
a
debt
owing
by
(inaudible)
and
it's
owing
by
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
the
paper
wouldn't
--
the
paper
wouldn't
be
enough.
i
have
to
admit,
sometimes
i
think
money
damages,
pretty
nearly
properties.(voice
