justice
felix
frankfurter
does
in
possession
have
a
technical
meaning
or
a
colloquial
meaning?
the
fellow
actually
has
money
to
be
--
which
he's
to
pay
over
to
somebody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
the
word
“possession”
in
full
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
all
sorts
of
meaning.
for
instance,
in
the
law
in
criminal
law,
whether
--
whether
it's
lost
and
you're
embezzled
with
terms
and
all
sorts
of
refined
distinctions.
now,
does
the
term
“in
possession”
here
involve
those
nice
distinctions
that
we
know
of
in
the
law
of
larceny
for
instance.
or
does
it
mean
--
what
ordinary
--
the
natural
meaning
that
jumps
into
your
mind
when
you
read
“in
possession”?
if
i
have
money
to
be
paid
or
to
be
distributed,
i
don't
know,
i
suppose
our
marshal
distributes
checks
to
the
various
people
who
work
under
this
roof.
is
he
in
possession
of
all
those
moneys,
would
you
say?
i'm
not
now
considering
whether
he
would
be
a
person
in
--
in
your
standards,
but
would
he
be
in
possession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
he
obligated
if
--
if
the
marshal
has
the
checks
for
all
the
employees
of
this
building,
isn't
he
obligated
in
respect
to,
to
pay
it
over
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you
can
get
mandamus
for
him
on
--
to
pay
it
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
in
possession
in
a
colloquial
sense
or
does
“in
possession”
here
have
some
very
fine
and
refined
--
i
suggest
the
law
of
larceny
is
full
of
nice
distinctions.
now,
do
we
have
to
worry
about
that
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
he's
got
the
things
which
belonged
to
somebody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
he
has
the
checks,
that's
really
actual,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
got
the
piece
of
a
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
a
remedy
against
the
taxpayers,
against
the
--
those
who
owed
the
taxes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
--
your
answer
is
no,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
government
of
the
united
states
can
bring
an
original
action
in
this
court
if
west
virginia
pays
over
to
a
delinquent
taxpayer
moneys
or
in
from
the
delinquent
tax
paid
to
united
states
in
aknowledge
of
that
tax,
pays
over
to
him
moneys
which
if
it
haven't
paid
over,
it
have
would
have
gone
to
the
treasury
because
then
there's
a
question
of
whether
this
court
would
entertain
that
suit
or
would
say,
bring
that
suit
in
the
state
courts,
we
did
in
the
--
the
jury's
actions.
that
remedy
goes
to
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
in
the
original
action
and
then
we
decide
whether
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
retain
or
shall
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
meant,
why
don't
you
bring
this
suit
for
a
little
few
dollars,
or
many
few
dollars
in
state
court
of
west
virginia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
say
the
statute
is
invalid,
you're
say
it
doesn't
apply
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
in
fact
legislated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
suit
wouldn't
be
under
this
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
would
be
a
general
--
a
general
original
action
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
against
the
state
for
money
owing
to
it
on
quasi
contractually
and
that
it
prevented
by
taking
over
money
which
belonged
to
united
states
with
delinquent
taxes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
think
in
all
the
conscience
to
hold
that
south
carolina
was
the
first,
and
under
the
taxing
law,
required
--
what
shall
i
say,
more
courageous
interpretation
than
to
hold
--
because
that
was
an
adverse
ruling
against
south
carolina,
wasn't
it?
it
imposed
a
tax,
it
imposed
--
it
levied
something
to
the
disadvantage
of
south
carolina
against
south
carolina.
here,
the
question
is
whether
a
ministerial
officer
should
pay
whole
what
--
in
good
conscience
belongs
to
the
united
states.
that's
all
there
is
to
this,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
minimizing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
could
--
could
be
all
state
officials
mandamus
your
auditor
to
pay
them
salaries
due
to
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
my
definition
of
a
ministerial
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i'm
assuming
the
state
--
i'm
assuming
his
salary
is
fixed.
i'm
assuming
there's
no
controversy
that
he
is
--
be
jury
officer.
i'm
assuming
that
the
salary
is
due.
and
i'm
making
all
other
assumptions
that
leave
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
hand
over
the
check
from
the
auditor
to
the
state
official.
it
--
doesn't
it
then
become
merely
a
ministerial
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
answer
to
that
would
be,
“i'm
very
sorry
but
a
superior
authority
has
told
me
to
pay
it
over
to
the
creditor
of
the
claimants.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
question
of
whether
that
doesn't
deal
with
the
question
whether
this
is
a
mandamus
of
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
order.
of
course
it
is
not
under
--
if
--
if
the
statute
--
the
united
states
statute
doesn't
require
him
to
honor
the
demand
of
the
secretary
of
treasury,
then
he
doesn't
have
to
honor.
but
as
to
what
the
relation
between
the
auditor
and
the
state
employee
is
--
is
unaffected
by
whether
or
not
uncle
sam
can
get
a
lien
against
him.
i
should
think
not
only
the
checks
are
made
out
but
he
could
be
compelled
to
make
all
the
checks.
unless
that's
regarded
as
violation
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
in
involuntary
servitude.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
disavowed
that
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
from
--
in
the
out
set.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
caplan,
may
i
interrupt?
i
looked
at
your
brief
for
the
government.
but
we
had
a
case
a
few
years
ago
involving
a
--
was
it
west
virginia
too?
the
compact,
the
ohio
compact.
remember
that
case?
(inaudible)
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
think
it
was
(inaudible)
wasn't
it?
yes,
where
he
--
wherein
the
claim
was
made,
the
claim
was
made
that
the
piece
of
paper
that
was
found
purporting
to
be
a
compact
exceeded
the
power
of
the
officials
under
the
constitution
of
west
virginia
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement.
and
the
case
came
here
and
we
found
no
difficulty
in
enjoining
the
--
was
it
the
same
gentleman.
how
long
has
he
been
in
office,
mr.
caplan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
could
always
be
mandamus.
in
that
case,
i
don't
know
why,
i
haven't
thought
of
it
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wrote
the
opinion
as
a
matter
of
fact.
in
that
case
we
--
we
held
that
--
that
he
didn't
have
an
excuse
even
though
the
constitution
of
delaware
with
west
virginia
which
we
purported
to
construe
at
the
time,
i
think
as
against
his
construction,
divide
into
to
pay
over
what
it
was
obligated
under
the
arraignment
proceedings,
i
forgot
what
the
first
date
was,
ohio
and
west
virginia
and
some
other
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
--
i
want
to
know,
there's
an
early
case
ms.
graney,
cary
and
curtis
way
back
which
allows
administrative
restraint
for
money
going
through
that,
is
that
still
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
number
of
instances,
ms.
graney,
which
this
court
have
held
that
a
state
is
a
person,
the
safety
appliance
act
and
so
on.
the
governing
consideration
is
incorrectly,
that's
why
i'm
putting
here
the
question.
governing
consideration
has
been
that
it
applies
unless
if
the
--
if
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
be
equally
applicable
to
the
state
as
an
agent,
as
a
--
as
a
legal
personality
as
it
would
be
to
a
private
corporation
and
individuals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
--
has
not
been
the
approach
in
the
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
so
that
--
so
that
the
burden
really
rests
on
west
virginia
or
any
other
state
that
the
bar
of
this
court
will
say,
there
are
reasons
that
would
negative
the
purpose
of
that
statute
for
the
inclusion
of
the
state
as
a
person
is
that
their
way
of
putting
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
general
definition
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
revenue
code.
it's
a
matter
of
the
revenue
code.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
revenue
code
includes
the
definition
of
person?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
giving
it
to
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
graney,
could
you
please
tell
me
why
--
i
think
you
do
not
make
your
problem
more
complicated
than
it
needs
to
be,
and
--
and
it
could
be
specific.
whether
or
not
the
auditor
is
personally
liable,
isn't
the
question
with
which
we
start,
that's
the
question
with
which
we
end.
the
question
is
whether
an
auditor
comes
within
the
terms
of
6332
(a).
and
that
means
--
is
he
a
person?
he
would
certainly
be
a
person.
is
he
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to
property?
and
i
just
think
on
--
on
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general,
i
don't
mean
to
say
--
say
imply
the
attorney
general
made
any
concession.
that
simply
cannot
be
recognized,
that
the
auditor
of
west
virginia
being
the
conduit
to
which
officials
and
employees
of
the
state
get
their
money,
even
in
possession
of
the
piece
of
the
paper,
checks
if
they
pay
full,
checks
assumed
are
due
or
is
obligated
with
respect
thereto
because
it
could
be
mandamus.
and
therefore,
if
--
if
the
auditor
comes
within
(a),
they
seems
to
unless
there's
some
reason
why
a
person
should
be
given
the
restrictive
meaning.
these
powers
have
a
consequence.
unless
you
say
a
state
auditor
being
between
two
fires,
that
of
a
state
that
of
the
united
states,
may
pay
the
money
to
the
--
to
the
secretary.
but
i
should
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is,
it
was
always
--
put
the
money
versary
of
the
court,
and
say
here.
uncle
sam
and
--
and
the
delinquent
taxpayers
fighting
over
this
thing,
i
put
this
in
the
versary
of
the
court
and
i'm
through
with
it.
so,
i
don't
see
why
he's
bothered
by
it,
whether
he's
personally
liable.
he
isn't
if
he
doesn't
come
within
(a),
i
mean
necessarily,
is
if
he
does
come
within
(a).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
see
why
you
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
perfectly
in
getting
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
i
have
great
respect
to
your
brief
but
i
don't
think
i
can
raise
res
judicata.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that's
my
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
put
it
to
you,
obligated
with
respect
to,
obligated
with
respect
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
not
an
actual
phraseology
to
express
if
a
man
owes
a
debt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
go
off
to
--
to
ascertain,
he
should
lie
for
the
next
two
years,
and
(inaudible)
of
a
big
bank,
(inaudible)
a
big
concern
and
leaves
money
with
the
bank
as
a
dispersing
agent
to
pay
my
employees
in
my
absence.
they
would
be
obligated
with
respect
to
but
it
isn't
a
phrase,
it
wouldn't
mean
that
they
are
the
primary
credit
--
creditors.
