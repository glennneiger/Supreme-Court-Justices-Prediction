ms.
melva
m.
graney
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
maybe
said
in
general
that
the
petitioners'
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
government
cannot
garnish
either
way
of
a
state
employee
except
through
the
state
garnishment
procedure.
and
of
course,
the
lien
and
levy
procedures
set
forth
in
section
6321
and
section
6331,
is
a
summary
garnishment
procedure.
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
the
lien,
the
government
which
attaches
by
the
delinquent
taxpayer
refuses
or
fails
to
pay,
is
the
equivalent
of
a
court
judgment.
and
the
notice
of
the
levy
is
the
equivalent
of
process
--
court
process.
the
summary
procedure
which
date
way
back
to
the
18th
century,
i
believe,
in
the
internal
revenue
laws.
the
particular
section
that
we're
concerned
with
here
was
first
passed
in
1926.
until
that
time,
the
levy
could
not
be
enforced
against
the
property
of
delinquent
taxpayers
if
it
were
in
the
hands
of
third
persons.
that's
what
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
i
don't
know
about
that
case
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
--
but
i
do
know
that
in
1926,
a
provision
was
specifically
inserted
in
the
revenue
laws
to
permit
the
enforcement
of
levies
when
the
property
was
held
by
third
persons,
and
that
is
the
statute.
it's
substantially
the
same
as
the
1926
statute.
now,
the
only
reason
all
the
requirements
of
the
garnishment
are
present
here
as
i
think
mr.
caplan
has
conceded.
the
only
argument
that's
really
being
made
is
that
the
government
can't
use
the
summary
procedure,
the
summary
garnishment
procedure
provided
by
federal
statute
because
he
argues
that
the
state
and
the
state
officer
are
not
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
so,
we
get
down
to
a
pure
question
of
statutory
construction.
and
the
petitioner's
position
on
that
is
directly
contrary
to
the
rule
that's
already
established
by
decisions
of
this
court.
the
argument
is
that
the
state
is
not
included
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
“person”
unless
it
is
expressly
included.
the
rule
established
by
several
decisions
of
this
court
and
principlely,
cases
relating
to
revenue
measures,
is
that
a
state
is
included
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
person,
unless
a
contrary
intent
is
indicated.
now,
no
argument
is
made
by
the
petitioner
as
to
any
contrary
intent
in
this
case,
at
least
i
--
it's
difficult
to
discern
any
other
than
the
fact
that
a
state
is
involved
and
a
state
is
a
sovereign.
actually,
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
is
in
no
way
affected
by
this
notice
of
levy
served
upon
the
state
auditor.
the
state's
only
interest
is
to
pay
the
accrued
salary
either
to
the
employee
or
to
the
employee's
account
in
such
a
way
as
to
discharge
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
pay
compensation.
and
of
course
that
obligation
would
be
discharged
if
mr.
sims
had
honored
the
levis.
that
is,
the
money
would
be
paid
over
on
the
delinquent
taxpayers'
obligation
to
the
government.
so,
there's
no
sovereign
interest
of
the
state
involved
here.
the
state
is
in
no
different
position
from
any
other
employer,
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
state
west
virginia
like
the
majority
of
other
states,
permits
even
private
creditors
to
garnish
either
salaries
of
state
employees
through
the
court
process,
the
normal
garnishment
procedure.
now,
on
the
question
of
construction
of
course,
we
think
first
of
all
that
the
word
person
as
defined
right
in
the
code
itself
is
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
no,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
constitutional
question
is
completely
out
of
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
has
already
held
that
the
government
can
require
a
state
agency
itself
just
like
under
the
withholding
tax
for
--
to
collect
a
federal
tax.
the
wilmette
park
district
case
decided
in
338
us
is
a
case
where
a
public
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
illinois
to
conduct
a
municipal
bathing
beach,
refused
to
collect
the
admissions
tax,
the
federal
admissions
tax.
the
commissioner
imposed
penalties
under
a
statute
similar
to
this,
every
person.
and
the
penalties
were
paid,
a
suit
for
refund
followed.
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
state
agency
was
required
to
collect
a
federal
admissions
tax,
that
after
all,
they're
just
a
collecting
agency.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
court
held
that
the
state
agency,
the
park
district
was
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
penalty
provision.
so,
i
don't
think
there's
really
any
constitutional
question
involved
here.
the
government
can
impose
the
duty
to
collect
tax
on
private
persons,
that's
settled
by
several
decisions
of
the
court.
and
can
impose
the
tax
directly
upon
the
state
for
a
non-governmental
function.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
i
think
so.
i
would
also
add
that
they
have
not
sustained
that
burden.
actually,
there's
no
reason
why
the
state
should
not
be
included
in
the
word
person
here.
well,
in
the
first
place,
let
me
say
that
the
--
the
word
person
itself
is
defined
in
statute
in
the
code,
sufficiently
broad
enough
to
cover
a
state.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
revenue
code.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
section
7701,
defines
a
person.
it's
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
page
23
in
the
footnote.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
no,
it's
not
against
a
state
but
we
have
assumed
that
an
agent
of
the
state
could
not
be
held
personally
liable
unless
the
principle
were
also
subject
to
the
statute.
so,
we
have
both
questions.
their
argument
primarily
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
we
think
the
statute
applies
to
both.
and
it
could
apply
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
well,
perhaps
we
have
to
show
that
it
also
applies
to
the
principle,
because
mr.
sims
possession
and
obligation
was
as
an
agent
of
the
state.
but
that
creates
no
problem
because
we
think
the
statute
applies
both
to
the
principle
--
the
state
as
the
principle
and
to
mr.
sims
and
the
agent.
now
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
no,
we
have
not
preceded
against
the
state.
but
i
think
this
is
something
mr.
caplan
was
attempting
to
explain
before
with
reference
to
our
position
and
so
on.
the
word
person
--
now,
for
general
purposes
of
the
code,
it's
defined
as
a
corporation,
individuals
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
the
words
includes
and
including
are
also
stated
--
that
--
well,
the
same
section
of
the
code
states
that
when
those
words
are
used
in
a
definition,
they
shall
not
be
deemed
to
exclude
other
things
otherwise
within
the
term
--
meaning
of
the
term
defined.
so,
the
word
person
is
comprehensive.
it
can
include
a
state
and
a
state
it
is
sometimes
considered
to
be
a
person.
the
question
is,
should
it
be
excluded
here.
now,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
sims
should
be
held
personally
liable
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
state,
the
very
section
that
we're
involved
with
here,
section
6332
provide
in
subsection
(c)
the
term
person
as
used
in
subsection
(a).
that
refers
to
possession
and
obligation.
includes
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
that's
right.
the
term
person
includes
an
officer
or
employee
of
a
corporation
or
a
member
or
employee
of
a
partnership,
who
as
such
officer
employee
or
member
is
under
a
duty
to
surrender
the
property
or
rights
to
property
or
to
discharge
the
obligation.
in
other
words,
the
word
is
defined
to
cover
people
acting
in
a
representative
capacity.
here,
the
agents
of
the
state.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
no,
specifically
no.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
but
here
again,
the
word
includes,
your
honor,
should
not
be
taken
to
mean
to
exclude
other
things
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
and
of
course
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
not
--
pardon?
ms.
melva
m.
graney
oh,
no,
no.
no,
it's
just
the
statute
is
broad
if
there's
any
person
and
person
itself
is
defined
in
such
a
way
that
that
is
as
broad
as
it
can
be.
so,
that
a
state
necessarily
comes
within
the
meaning
of
the
language.
that
is
just
broad
enough
to
include
it.
now,
consistently,
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we
would
say
that
it
should
still
be
excluded
provided
there
is
some
reason
to
exclude
it
but
there
is
no
reason.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
the
pertinent
treasury
regulation,
and
that
became
effective
january
1,
1955
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
--
prior
to
the
levies
here.
merely
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
no,
except
that
the
treasury
likes
to
be
specific.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes,
but
i
would
also
say
that
it
did
not
become
applicable
to
state
employees
until
1938
when
this
court
held
that
state
employees
were
subject
to
the
federal
income
tax.
now,
speaking
of
the
administrative
practice,
the
treasury
regulation
of
course
has
been
in
effect
now,
almost
four
years
or
over
three
at
least.
normally,
the
court
would
give
some
weight
to
that
fact.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
administrative
practice
of
levying
upon
state
employees'
salaries
for
delinquent
federal
taxes,
dates
way
back
at
least
the
1943
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
in
its
opinion.
in
--
on
june
20,
1943
issue
of
the
wall
street
journal,
there
was
an
article
stating
that
the
united
states
is
cracking
down
on
new
york
workers
who
are
evading
their
taxes.
that
the
government
has
filed
notices
of
levy
with
the
state
controller
and
that
the
state
controller,
unadvised
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
was
honoring
those
levis.
that's
over
15
years
ago.
the
practice
has
been
consistent.
and
i
might
say
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
advised
that
some
information
it
has,
it's
believed
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
state
has
complied
or
made
other
arrangements
for
the
payment
of
the
tax.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
that's
right.
i
think
two
points
in
that
connection.
the
argument
with
respect
to
(a),
he
says
on
the
one
hand
that
he
is
not
in
position
of
the
property
because
he
was
not
in
possession
of
it
as
an
individual.
well,
that's
true.
but
the
statute
makes
him
liable
for
his
possession
and
obligation
as
an
agent
of
the
state.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
but
that
applies
to
(a).
ms.
melva
m.
graney
in
the
final
analysis
because
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
well
now,
i
may
say
this.
we
have
assumed
that
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
particular
problem
with
respect
to
it
because
it
is
covered.
but
now,
the
south
carolina
case
stating
the
facts
at
199
u.s.,
the
dispensers
or
state
liquor
stores
were
held
to
be
liable
for
the
federal
license
tax
on
retail
liquor
dealers.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
expressly
recognized
that
they
were
acting
only
as
agents
of
the
state
but
it
said,
if
the
principle
is
not
exempt,
they
are
not
either.
so,
maybe
we
shouldn't
worry
about
it.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
on
the
assumption
that
the
possession
of
sims
as
auditor
was
that
of
the
state.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
if
--
as
the
state
as
a
principle
and
of
sims
as
an
agent.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
but
the
whole
point
is
whether
we're
arguing
more
than
we
have
to.
both
the
state
and
the
state
officer
are
covered
within
the
statutes.[laughs]
ms.
melva
m.
graney
he
is
--
the
person
who
is
obligated
with
respect
to
the
accrued
salaries
of
the
delinquent
taxpayers.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
well,
you
can
put
it
that
way.
but
he
doesn't
have
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
the
statute
also
says
“or
obligated
with
respect
to”.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
principle.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
well,
i
think
the
language
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to
is
about
as
broad
as
it
could
be
made
in
the
circumstance
of
a
statute
of
this
nature.
now,
petitioner
does
not
make
any
argument
about
this
other
than
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
obligated
as
an
individual,
that's
his
only
argument.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
well,
i
think
that
interpretation
is
required
by
the
definition
of
a
person
contained
in
subsection
(c)
and
it's
defined
for
the
purposes
of
subsection
(a)
as
including
a
person
acting
in
a
representative
capacity,
who
as
such
officer,
employee
or
member
is
under
a
duty
to
surrender
the
property.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
oh.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
any
person
in
possession
of
or
obligated
with
respect
to
property
or
rights
to
property.
the
warrants
which
are
issued
by
the
state
auditor
are
the
things
that
he
uses
to
get
his
paycheck,
rights
to
property.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
the
state
auditor
doesn't
issue
the
warrants,
the
employee
doesn't
get
paid.
the
state
auditor
is
the
person
who
has
control
of
the
situation.
i
think
petitioner
concede
that.
there's
just
one
point
i'd
like
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
property
or
properties.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
that's
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
that's
right.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
yes,
he
is
the
proper
officer.
there's
no
question
about
that.
ms.
melva
m.
graney
no,
not
as
an
individual,
he's
(voice
overlap)
ms.
melva
m.
graney
we
think
so.
this
--
ms.
melva
m.
graney
there's
just
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make.
actually,
the
--
the
levy
could
have
been
released
with
mr.
sims
with
simply
made
arrangements
with
the
district
director
and
the
delinquent
taxpayers.
another
way
in
which
he
could
have
evaded
the
personal
liability
was
by
simply
holding
the
warrant
and
said,
“i
have
them,
i
haven't
paid
them
out.”
it
would
have
required
a
suit
by
the
government
but
his
personal
liability
would
have
only
been
technical
because
he
still
have
the
money
be
available
for
the
payment
of
the
tax
liabilities.
