mr.
leon
silverman
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
adversary
has
touched
on
three
points
that
he
wishes
to
urge
and
i
will
deal
with
him
if
i
may
in
the
same
order
that
he
dealt
with
them.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
here
a
waiver
of
indictment,
the
filing
of
an
information.
the
information
charged
the
violation
of
the
kidnapping
statute
and
the
question
is
then
presented,
was
the
offense
involved
in
this
entire
transaction,
one
that
was
punishable
by
death?
and
our
answer
to
that
question
is
that
it
was
not.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
leon
silverman
if
your
honor
please.
justice
--
that
judge
hand
in
the
parrino
case,
in
a
case
which
was
not
like
the
one
we
are
dealing
with,
said
that
the
allegation
as
to
whether
the
man
was
released
harmed
or
unharmed
is
not
--
is
not
a
part
of
the
offense.
and
if
one
may
look
to
the
entire
circumstances
of
the
case
and
one
may
then
decide
whether
or
not
the
man
was
harmed
or
unharmed,
and
then
that
will
determine
whether
this
was
a
capital
offense.
mr.
leon
silverman
i'm
saying,
sir,
that
if
--
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
that
if
judge
hand's
dictum
in
that
case
is
right,
then
the
government
is
ahead
on
that
point
because
in
the
entire
case,
it
is
undisputed
and
that
was
found
both
by
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
victim
here
was
released
unharmed
and
there
has
never
been
the
slightest
question
as
to
that.
but
if
judge
hand
may
not
--
is
not
right
and
i
needn't
argue
whether
he
is
or
he's
not
at
the
moment,
then
the
question
as
to
what
it
is
that
must
be
alleged,
we
submit,
is
not
that
the
victim
was
released
unharmed
in
order
to
proceed
by
information.
the
necessary
allegation
is,
if
it
is
necessary
that
the
man
was
released
harmed
in
order
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
consequently,
our
position
is
that
if
judge
hand
is
right,
then
the
information
was
proper.
and
if
judge
hand
was
wrong,
then
we
proceeded
in
a
manner
here
which
lends
itself
to
the
filing
of
an
information
because
this
was
not
a
capital
crime.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
that
if
the
crime
of
murder
is
based
on
premeditation,
one
would
have
to
allege
--
mr.
leon
silverman
in
that
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
that
in
order
to
proceed
for
the
--
mr.
leon
silverman
(voice
overlap)
for
the
more
--
for
the
more
serious
penalty
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
one
should
allege
the
aggravating
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime.
mr.
leon
silverman
if
i
may
rephrase
my
understanding
of
what
you
have
said
before
i
concede
too
much.
if
the
supposition
is
that
a
--a
pleading
was
acceptable
of
two
kinds
of
proof,
one
which
would
subject
the
accused
to
a
greater
penalty
and
one
to
a
lesser,
and
if
the
government
never
had
any
intention
and
indeed
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
greater
offense
had
been
committed.
under
those
circumstances
i
would
say
that
by
not
alleging
greater
circumstances
or
surrounding
or
aggravating
circumstances,
the
government
would
not
seek
the
capital
punishment.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
have
not
read
the
cases
but
my
offhand
reaction
would
be
that
you
could
proceed
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
in
that
fashion
and
that
was
in
my
reaction
to
your
question.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say,
yes
sir
except
the
fact
allegation
could
not
be
in
an
information
because
if
you
allege
the
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
capital
nature
of
the
crime,
it
could
only
be
by
indictment.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
think
so,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
that
is
the
second
string
to
my
bow
if
it
please,
the
court.
the
first
string
is
the
argument
of
mr
--
or
of
judge
hand
in
the
parrino
case.
none
of
these
is
necessarily
alleged
but
that
you
may
determine
the
capital
nature
of
the
offense
from
everything
that
you
know
about
the
case,
and
that
found
it's
echo
in
the
parker
case,
a
very
similar
--
to
the
parrino
case
involving
a
--
the
--
this
kidnapping
statute
in
which
the
issue
was
whether
the
accused
should
have
been
given
a
list
of
(inaudible)
man
and
list
of
witnesses.
if
this
were
a
capital
crime
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
that.
he
was
not
furnished
that.
and
the
court
then
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
said,
“this
is
no
grounds
for
throwing
this
case
out.”
in
that
case,
no
death
penalty
had
been
recommended
by
the
--
by
the
jury.
if
--
and
there's
no
question
if
the
man
was
not
released
harmed
and
that
means
that
this
is
not
a
capital
case.
and
indeed
judge
hand's
decision
is
--
is
a
very
similar
one.
it
was
a
statute
of
limitations
problem.
the
question
was
whether
the
statute
was
told
if
this
were
a
capital
offense.
in
that
case,
that
the
jury
returned
a
recommendation
of
no
death
penalty.
that
didn't
satisfy
judge
hand.
what
he
said
was
that
you
really
can't
make
this
a
capital
case
by
the
mere
allegation.
in
order
to
make
this
a
capital
case,
you
must
in
fact
determine
whether
the
man
was
released
harmed
or
unharmed
and
the
jury's
recommendation
that
there
should
not
be
a
death
penalty
here,
was
not
conclusive
because
they
may
have
decided
not
to
recommend
the
death
penalty
for
all
kinds
of
reasons,
none
of
which
may
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
harmed
or
unharmed
condition
of
the
victim.
and
so
he
sends
it
back,
remands
it
for
a
trial
and
presumably
for
a
finding
on
the
specific
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
man
was
harmed
or
unharmed
because
it
is
--
it
is
that
which
make
it
a
capital
offense.
mr.
leon
silverman
my
first
position
is
that
that
is
not
a
necessary
allegation.
my
second
position
is
that
if
it
is,
it
is
necessary
to
charge
that
he
was
harmed.
that
you
--
it
--
that
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
the
government
must
give
notice
of
the
lesser
crime
and
this
is
really,
i
--
i
submit,
a
notice
problem.
we
are
interested
in
having
the
accused
i
--
i
should
think,
aware
of
what
it
is
that
he
is
facing.
and
it
--
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
but
after
that
--
mr.
leon
silverman
oh
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
the
argument
was
concluded.
mr.
leon
silverman
that
my
feeling
is
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
that
--
my
feeling
is
that
sense
to
a
defendant
would
seem
to
indicate
that
one
should
inform
him
of
the
capital
nature
of
the
crime
without
the
necessity
for
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
speculation.
mr.
leon
silverman
would
or
would
not,
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
certainly
agree
here
that
notice
is
not
the
only
consideration,
and
that
indeed
a
grand
jury
certainly
if
the
federal
rules
have
not
been
adopted
one
would
have
serious
questions
to
whether
there
could
ever
be
a
waiver
not
on
a
constitutional
level
because
the
gill
case
get
away
with
that
but
on
the
authority
of
the
government
to
proceed
in
a
manner
other
than
by
indictment.
but
the
federal
rules
have
made
it
quite
clear
that
this
may
be
waived
except
in
a
capital
crime.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
sir
that
i
--
i
should
like
to
comment
at
least
on
one
aspect
of
the
formulation
that
you
made.
and
that
is
the
second
offender
situation.
that
has
been
distinguished
from
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
am
talking
about.
and
that
is
the
aggravating
circumstances
of
crime.
it's
been
distinguished
in
the
case
of
myers
against
the
united
states
in
the
fifth
circuit.
and
in
the
subsequent
case
of
jordan
against
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
circuit
court
in
the
district.
and
in
the
jordan
case,
the
court
distinguished
the
second
offender
situation
in
these
words.
it
said,
“in
the
second
offender
situation,
however,
the
criminal
act
which
is
proscribed
is
the
same
regardless
of
the
background
of
the
criminal.
the
previous
offense
is
merely
out
of
historical
fact.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
penalty
may
appropriately
be
made
more
severe
because
of
the
demonstrated
contributings
of
the
defendant.
on
the
other
hand,
where
the
aggravation
arises
from
the
manner
in
which
the
crime
was
committed,
in
substance,
a
different
aspect
of
the
offense
is
sought
to
be
punished.
accordingly,
we
think
is
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
myers
case,
that
the
facts
and
aggravation
must
be
charged
in
the
indictment
and
found
to
be
true
by
the
jury.
and
i
submit,
sir,
that
was
--
mr.
leon
silverman
well
sir,
i
--
i
must
repeat
again
the
two
of
possible
three-string
argument
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
unnecessarily
persistent
about
this.
and,
that
is,
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
say
that
judge
hand
was
right
or
wrong
about
the
necessity
for
alleging.
but
if
he
is
right,
then
he
and
indeed
the
judge
in
the
parker
case
said
that
one
could
determine
whether
the
victim
was
released
unharmed
from
circumstances
outside
the
specific
pleading.
and
that's
what
--
mr.
leon
silverman
if
that
is
right
sir,
then
i
submit
that
in
this
case
there
is
unquestioned
and
undoubted
evidence
or
undisputed
evidence.
the
fact
was
the
fact.
if
i
need
go
further
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
driven
to
--
to
go
further,
but
i
present
this
because
i
think
that
a
full
discussion
of
what
is
perhaps
a
matter
of
first
instance,
in
this
court,
ought
to
be
developed.
if
i
need
go
further
then
i
would
take
the
position
that
i
have
outlined
as
the
second
string
to
my
bow
and
would
cite
in
support
of
that.
this
court's
decision
in
the
cordell
case
where
in
a
footnote,
the
court
says
that
in
effect,
you
may
proceed
for
the
lesser
of
the
two
aspects
of
the
offense
by
information.
unless
i
convey
the
impression
that
that
was
not
a
thought
--
a
well
thought-out
part
of
the
cordell
case,
i
hasten
to
add
that
it
was
thoroughly
briefed
by
both
sides
that
was
appealed
from
that
case.
mr.
leon
silverman
sir?
mr.
leon
silverman
that's
perfectly
true,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
well
if
you
all
please
--
if
as
i
believe
your
--
your
remarks
suggest,
the
court
may
become
interested
in
the
broader
problem
here
presented.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
material
at
the
end
of
our
brief
which
i
think
rather,
persuasively,
talks
about
the
policy
considerations
with
respect
to
the
waiver
of
the
indictment.
and
i
need
not
belabor
you
the
point
except
to
say
that
it
would
be
a
most
serious
decision
from
the
point
of
view
of
those
prisoners
who
may
have
to
languish
in
jail
for
months
awaiting
the
action
of
a
grand
jury
which
does
not
meet
as
frequently
as
it
does
in
our
larger
metropolitan
areas.
waiting
only
for
the
formality
of
an
indictment
when
he
knows,
and
i
must
assume
for
these
purposes,
that
he
is
guilty
of
the
crime,
and
wants
to
plead
to
the
crime
having
released
the
man
unharmed
he
--
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
the
--
the
hardship
here,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
a
man
gets
no
credit
for
time
in
the
federal
system,
prior
to
his
sentence.
and
so
every
moment
that
he
spends
in
jail
prior
to
the
judge
giving
him
a
term
of
his
is,
is
granted
and
sir,
i
may
suggest
and
if
i
may
be
permitted
at
least
from
my
personal
experience
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office,
i
--
i
--
it
has
happened
so
very
often
that
a
man
apprehended
in
the
course
of
a
crime,
comes
in
and
says,
“now,
look,
let's
--
let's
get
this
show
on
the
road.
i'm
--
i'm
--
you
--
you
got
me."
now,
how
can
i
most
quickly
get
this
--
start
to
do
the
time
that
i'm
going
to
get?
and
there's
no
nonsense
about
the
fact
that
the
man
knows
that
he's
going
to
get
time.
if
in
--
if
in
new
york,
that
happened,
i
--
i
suggest
there's
a
grand
jury
in
session,
at
least
everyday,
and
indeed
many
grand
juries
who
are
in
session
concurrently.
but
if
you
go
to
the
more
rural
areas
of
our
country,
it
maybe
months
and
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
the
notes
of
the
--
mr.
leon
silverman
exactly
sir
and
that
was
pointed
out
as
the
reason
for
rule
set
that.
mr.
leon
silverman
--
is
permitting
the
waiver.
mr.
leon
silverman
mr.
justice,
having
formulated
the
proposition
in
those
terms,
i
can't
but
agree
but
i
believe
that
you
would
perhaps
assume
the
--
the
conclusion
in
the
formulation.
the
question
here
is
if
it's
a
capital
offense
and
i
am
positing
my
argument
on
the
assumption
that
the
victim
was
released
unharmed.
mr.
leon
silverman
sir?
mr.
leon
silverman
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
that
the
necessity
for
letting
--
for
--
for
alleging
the
lesser
of
the
two
possible
aspects
of
the
crime
is
at
least
to
my
untutored
ear
not
a
--
the
--
the
best
way
to
approach
the
problem
of
the
giving
of
--
telling
a
man
what
it
is
he
is
charged
with.
i
think
it's
much
more
direct
to
do
it
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
in
terms
of,
you
are
charged
with
the
greater
crime.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
--
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
suggest
that
if
--
i
--
i
can
only
go
back
again
to
the
parrino
case
with
judge
hand
speaking
for
the
second
circuit.
mr.
leon
silverman
it
is
indeed,
sir.
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
note
that
although
judge
hand
uses
very
broad
language
about
the
necessity
for
making
an
allegation
of
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
offense
and
he
finds
that
this
is
not
an
aspect
of
the
offense,
but
he
is
using
this
language
in
a
case
which
is
very
peculiar
because
it
is
a
statute
of
limitations
case
and
as
i
read
it,
and
perhaps
i
am
reading
it
with
more
intuition
than
understanding
but
as
i
read
it,
i
have
the
feeling
that
what
judge
hand
was
there
saying
that
it
isn't
good
enough
for
the
prosecutor
to
charge
that
the
man
was
released
harmed
to
convert
it
into
a
capital
case
because
that
gives
the
prosecutor
free
play.
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
--
mr.
leon
silverman
logically,
what
i
would
say
that
if
he
--
if
it
were
alleged
that
the
victim
was
released
unharmed
under
those
circumstances,
i
am
not
convinced
that
it
would
be
simple
variance
for
example,
to
put
in
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
man
was
released
harmed
--
mr.
leon
silverman
i
do
think
that
you
would
be
bound
by
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
--
i
think
you
--
i
think
the
government
probably
would,
which
is
to
--
to
make
the
allegation,
that
is
i
think
we
are
bound
to
a
point
where
in
the
--
the
real
question
seems
to
be
what
is
the
best
procedure
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--for
--
mr.
leon
silverman
well
--
mr.
leon
silverman
no,
sir.
i
think
that
probably
he
would
be
bound
by
it
and
i
must,
of
course,
say
that
if
i
were
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
the
united
states
attorney
drawing
up
an
information
or
an
indictment
as
the
case
may
be,
it
would
not
be
terribly
difficult
to
put
these
words
into
--
mr.
leon
silverman
then
i
would
go
--
i
--
i
would
have
to
take
your
argument,
sir,
and
take
it
one
step
forward.
and
that
is,
the
poor
fellow
who
may
be
caught
and
says,
i
want
out.
i
want
to
start
to
do
my
time.
and
the
united
states
attorney
under
those
circumstances,
well,
i
suppose
there
he
could
charge
him
with
an
information.
i'm
sorry
if
i
missed
--
i
--
i
misdirected
my
remarks
to
you.
mr.
leon
silverman
he
could,
sir.
but
i
really
think
that
the
problem
is
one,
of
where
a
man
has
been
released
harmed.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
allegation
that
perhaps
ought
to
be
made
to
put
the
man
who
is
now
being
charged,
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
the
capital
offense.
the
harming
of
a
man
during
a
kidnapping,
that
is
the
thing
that
leads
to
the
capital
offense.
and
i
say
i
find
support
for
this
position
in
the
cases
that
i
have
read
and
i
--
i
have
found
no
support
for
the
alternative
position.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say,
yes.
that
that
the
--
mr.
leon
silverman
that's
right.
it's
just
as
practical
one
way
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
or
the
other.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
--
i
--
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
sir,
the
--
the
[laughs]
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
my
second
argument
is
that
the
government
should
and
i
should
say
that
i
have
asked
that
the
records
of
the
department
be
searched
because
i
thought
this
would
be
of
some
interest
to
the
court.
and
i
find
that,
at
least
from
the
research,
that
we
have
done,
we
have
never
proceeded
against
a
kidnapper
who
has
released
his
victim
harmed
except
by
making
the
allegation
that
he
wants
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
to
be
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
harmed.
mr.
leon
silverman
now,
i
--
i
am
facing
to
qualify,
justice
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
black,
but
my
research
which
i
personally
didn't
adapt
to
but
which
i
asked
to
be
done
and
i
asked
that
it
be
done
several
days
ago
during
the
preparation
of
this
argument.
mr.
leon
silverman
--
that
the
answer
came
back
that
in
all
of
the
cases
and
those
people
who'd
been
in
the
department
for
donkey's
years
in
this
section
of
the
department
that
we
seek
the
capital
offense
only
after
an
allegation
that
the
victim
has
been
released
harmed.
mr.
leon
silverman
which
is
the
--
mr.
leon
silverman
in
which
case,
sir,
i
--
i
would
suggest
that
if
one
may
wait
to
the
end
of
the
--
of
the
proceedings
before
one
makes
a
determination,
then
in
this
case,
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
victim
was
released
unharmed
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
and
that
therefore
this
is
not
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
a
capital
offense.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
--
if
you
say
in
a
felony,
in
--
in
a
normal
felony
case.
mr.
leon
silverman
and
the
indictment
here
in
that
--
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
it
would
be
open
to
in
that.
mr.
leon
silverman
would
this
then
be
--
mr.
leon
silverman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
that
was,
if
i
may
go
back
to
my
former
--
my
--
my
prior
formulation,
that
was
the
second
string.
mr.
leon
silverman
my
--
my
--
you're
absolutely
right,
sir
that
my
opponent
and
i
point
to
the
same
case
and
--
and
indeed
almost
the
language
and
draw
different
conclusions
from
it.
mr.
leon
silverman
if
i
go
through
that,
however
--
mr.
leon
silverman
if
it
is
not
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense
to
allege
whether
a
victim
has
been
released
harmed
or
unharmed,
and
i
must
then
seek
refuge
in
the
--
in
--
in
the
other
thing
that
judge
hand
says.
and
if
you
may
look
to
the
entire
proceedings
to
make
that
determination,
then
i
say,
in
this
case
if
it
was
not
necessary
to
make
the
allegation
and
if
we
do
look
to
the
other
--
to
the
remaining
part
of
this
proceeding,
we
come
to
the
undeniable
conclusion
that
the
victim
was
released
unharmed.
therefore
i
say
that
if
judge
hand
was
right,
then
this
is
not
a
capital
offense.
now,
i
--
i
--
so
this
is
obviously
an
inability
on
my
part
to
communicate
the
thought
that
i'm
trying
to
express
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
can
differ
with
that.
mr.
leon
silverman
if
the
remaining
evidence
showed
that
in
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
fact
he
was
released
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
harmed.
mr.
leon
silverman
and
i
will
go
further
and
ask
your
honor
to
again
to
--
to
read
the
parker
case
which
is
hand
in
hand
with
parrino.
mr.
leon
silverman
right.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes
sir,
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
leon
silverman
i'm
certain
that
you
will
find
in
the
parrino
case.
mr.
leon
silverman
all
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes.
mr.
leon
silverman
no.
mr.
leon
silverman
well
--
mr.
leon
silverman
the
other
two
are,
if
there
is
an
allegation
that
is
necessary,
it
must
come
in
terms
of
the
aggravated
circumstances
of
the
crime
that
absent
the
aggravated
circumstances
charged.
one
may
go
only
--
that
one
must
assume
that,
on
capital
nature
of
it.
if
you
want
to
make
it
a
capital
crime,
you
must
charge
in
undeniable
language
that
the
man
was
released
harmed.
that
would
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
be
the
second
string
to
the
bow.
and
the
third
string
is
the
one
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
and
that
is
having
proceeded
by
information.
this
was
certainly
--
this
was
certainly
a
notice
to
the
--
the
defendant
that
the
government
here
did
not
consider
it
and
it
could
not
be
a
capital
offense.
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
when
you
say
“harm”
sir
--
mr.
leon
silverman
from
here
on
in,
i
should
say
it
would
do
no
more
injury
than
requiring
the
government
to
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
allege
the
greater
in
an
indictment.
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
i
cannot
speak
of
my
own
knowledge.
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
do
further
injury.
i
--
i
do
not
know.
i
cannot
at
this
moment
stand
in
the
point.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
that
what
would
be
affected
is
a
long
and
--
so
far
as
i
know,
unquestioned
line
of
authority
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
have
held
and
that
is
where
it
is
the
greater
aspect
of
the
offense,
you
do
charge
the
greater
crime.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
--
i
--
mr.
leon
silverman
i
cannot
now
tell
you
sir
because
my
--
because
i
am
not
--
i
do
not
work
intimately
in
this
field
what
the
other
practical
effects
of
this
would
be.
i
would
have
to
rely
on
the
three
strings
in
my
bow.
mr.
leon
silverman
one
could
--
when
you
say
that
the
information
must
be
right
because
it
couldn't
be
wrong
is
perhaps
to
state
it
as
its
simplest
then
that
makes
it
the
third
string
to
our
bow.
i
--
i
suggest
that
the
other
two
are
far
more
compelling.
mr.
leon
silverman
the
filing
of
the
information
alone?
mr.
leon
silverman
i
will
find
it
for
just
--
in
just
a
second,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
well
i
--
the
one
that's
been
--
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
--
mr.
leon
silverman
the
petitioner
could
not
have
been
given
the
death
penalty
on
his
plea
on
this
case.
rule
7
is
explicit
on
the
point.
no
person
charged
by
information
could
suffer
the
death
penalty.
the
information
would
not
support
a
sentence
more
severe
than
life
imprisonment
so
that
the
third
is
mentioned,
sir,
on
36
of
our
brief
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
line
of
cases
starting
--
which
i've
started
with
cordel
and
which
deal
with
--
with
the
national
prohibition
act
for
example,
the
--
the
two
aspects
of
an
offense
or
the
bank
robbery
or
mail
theft
do
not
appear
in
our
brief
because
these
were
developed
as
i
was
preparing
this
case
for
argument
and
i'm
as
--
i
--
i
have
developed
these
points
more
fully
than
i
normally
would
only
because
they
do
not
--
mr.
leon
silverman
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
that
one
would
but
they
are
sufficiently
similar.
mr.
leon
silverman
there's
no
case
just
like
this
that
we
have
found.
now,
if
i
may
direct
myself
for
just
--
for
my
remaining
time
to
the
due
process
argument
that
has
been
made
by
my
adversary.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
like
to
direct
my
time
to
the
due
process
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leon
silverman
that
my
adversary
referred
to.
i
really
think
that
this
--
mr.
leon
silverman
on
the
other
hand
sir,
although
one
may
find
the
impropriety
and
certainly,
the
government
does
not
state
that
the
conduct
of
the
judge
in
entertaining
mr.
lill
in
his
chambers
prior
to
accepting
the
plea
is
one
that
can
be
commended.i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
the
simple
impropriety
unless
it
had
some
effect
on
the
rights
of
the
accused.
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
sir,
i
suggest
that
the
--
the
per
quod
of
the
federal
rules
have
never
gone
to
the
point
where
a
judge
who
has
tried
a
man
and
has
had
--
and
has
imposed
sentence,
and
for
one
reason
or
another,
has
had
that
sentence
in
trial
reversed
by
an
appellant
court,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
that
judge
is
ever
precluded
from
retrying
the
same
man
yet
that
is
--
isn't
that
in
the
same
spirit?
here
is
a
judge
who
has
gotten
information
about
the
man's
criminal
background
one
thing
and
another
but
we
had
so
far
as
i
know,
never
ruled
a
judge
out
of
a
second
--
mr.
leon
silverman
that
--
mr.
leon
silverman
well
sir,
whether
it'd
be
due
process
or
whether
it'd
be
the
power
of
this
court
to
supervise
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
that
is
no
longer
in
this
case.
whatever
the
grounds
were,
the
court
of
appeals
saw
to
it
that
this
man
was
brought
up
for
sentence
by
a
judge
who
had
not
engaged
in
that
practice,
judge
kennamer
--
mr.
leon
silverman
having
died
--
mr.
leon
silverman
may
be
sir
that
you're
operating
on
an
erroneous
impression,
i
--
i
believe
you
are
all
right?
mr.
leon
silverman
what
happened
in
the
first
--
mr.
leon
silverman
no,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
if
that
is
my
opponent's
argument.
mr.
leon
silverman
but
let
me
just
explain
what
did
happen
here.
the
court
of
appeals
did
use
the
language
in
the
first
time
that
it
considered
the
merits
after
the
2255
hearing
before
judge
--
before
judge
johnson.
they
did
use
the
language
that
my
adversary
cited
to
the
court.
and
they
concluded
their
opinion
and
indeed
their
mandate
originally
prepared
contained
the
language.
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
cause
is
remanded
with
directions
to
grant
the
motion
to
satisfy
the
conviction
and
sentence,
and
to
proceed
further
and
not
inconsistently
herewith.
however,
the
united
states
--
mr.
leon
silverman
it
is
in
the
reported
case
which
is
not
in
our
transcript.
mr.
leon
silverman
the
remand
is
on
--
mr.
leon
silverman
forgive
me.
justice
brennan
called
my
attention
to
page
268
of
the
record.
mr.
leon
silverman
however
it
said,
immediately
the
united
states
turned
to
move
for
reargument
before
rehearing.
and
the
court,
while
it's
opinion
was
fresh
in
its
mind
and
when
it
had
a
chance
to
see
what
the
implications
of
this
language
were,
then
changed
its
mandate.
and
its
mandate
then
with,
that
is
it
added
to
what
appears,
the
language,
instead
of
putting
a
period
after
herewith,
they
put
a
comma
there
and
they
then
went
on
“including
if
the
district
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
ends
of
justice
require
it,
permitting
the
defendant
to
withdraw
his
waiver
of
counsel
and
his
plea
of
guilty
and
to
stand
trial.”
mr.
leon
silverman
now
i
say
--
mr.
leon
silverman
that
is
what
he
said
but
judge
rives'
position
in
this
case
is
a
very
interesting
one.
in
the
first
place,
he
said
when
this
first
came
up,
when
there
was
no
2255
here
--
mr.
leon
silverman
what
he
said
was
that
--
mr.
leon
silverman
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
the
court
--
what
the
court
meant
by
using
the
language
that
it
did,
of
course.
and
i
would
say
to
you
that
the
court
has
interpreted
what
it
meant
on
two
separate
occasions.
one
on
the
rehearing,
when
it
amended
its
mandate,
and
the
second
time
on
the
appeal
from
the
new
sentence
when
it
found
specifically
that
the
district
george
--
judge
had
meticulously
carried
out
the
mandate.
and
that
appears
in
the
--
in
the
record
on
page
267
of
the
record
by
suitable
language
in
the
opinion
itself
and
by
similar
precise
terms
in
the
mandate,
we
sought
on
rehearing
to
make
it
plain
that
the
sentence
of
conviction
of
30
years
imprisonment
was
alone
mandatorily
to
be
set
aside.
and
that
is
to
the
plea
of
guilty
in
waivers
the
district
court
was
free
to
allow
such
of
these
as
the
interest
of
justice
might
require.
the
district
court
finding
expressly
that
the
interest
of
justice
did
not
so
require,
paid
scrupulous
heed
to
and
carried
out
the
precise
terms
of
our
mandate.
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
who
knew
best
what
it
meant,
said
that
it
did
not
mean
that
this
denial
of
due
process
or
justice
frankfurter's
lesser
formulation
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
problem,
it
--
it
did
not
say
that
this
vitiated
the
proceedings
at
all.
it
vitiated
the
sentence
and
the
sentence
was
then
re-imposed.
the
--
the
trial
judge
made
very,
very
specific
findings
with
respect
to
what
have
taken
place
before
judge
kennamer
and
found
that
the
pleas
and
the
waivers
were
all
quite
voluntarily
made.
mr.
leon
silverman
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
the
conversation
between
agent
lill
and
judge
kennamer
prior
to
the
court
appearance.
mr.
leon
silverman
and
nothing
more.
i
will
say
in
--
in
all
fairness
because
the
court
does
use
the
language,
the
incontinent
speed
and
inordinate
haste
of
the
proceedings,
i
would
only
add
--
i
--
i
would
say
that
at
first
the
court
said
that
but
if
we
are
to
find
out
what
it
meant,
we
must
look
to
its
mandate
and
its
subsequent
opinion.
and
secondly,
this
court
may
inspect
the
transcript
of
what
took
place
before
judge
kennamer.
and
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
this
court
will
find
that
the
defendant
here
involved,
who
when
he
came
before
judge
kennamer
was
no
stranger
to
the
criminal
law
to
use
the
phrase
that
the
cases
used.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
leon
silverman
well
i
can
--
i
can
tell
you
his
familiarity
with
the
criminal
law
because
that
is
a
part
of
this
record.
and
judge
johnson
elicited
the
information
from
this
man.
he
had
been
convicted
of
two
prior
direct
offenses.
he
escaped
from
chillicothe
institute.
he
stole
a
car.
he
then
had
it
on
robbery.
he
was
sentenced
for
that.
i
can
go
on
and
on,
sir
and
--
and
indicate
to
you
that
this
man
knew
very
well
what
it
is
that
he
was
charged
with
and
what
it
is
that
he
was
doing
and
that
the
record
is
replete.
and
if
i
--
if
i
may
i
can
--
i
can
deal
with
any
one
of
these
things
and
point
out
where
in
the
record.
this
man
was
informed
of
his
rights
to
counsel.
this
happened
time
and
time
again
from
the
moment
he
came
before
the
commissioner
on
arraignment
until
the
--
the
time
that
he
was
sentenced
by
the
court.
he
was
told
by
the
commissioner,
he
was
told
by
the
fbi
agent,
he
was
told
by
the
united
states
attorney
and
his
codefendant
even
protested
that,
“don't
bother
us
now,
we
--
we'd
had
enough
of
this.
we
don't
want
counsel.”
and
he
was
told
by
the
judge
--
he
was
told
by
the
judge
on
several
occasions
in
--
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
so
that
the
-
the
talk
about
his
--
his
waiver
of
counsel
i
suggest
is
not
substantiated
by
the
record
but
in
fact
the
record
points
out
that
this
man
knew,
had
adequate
advice
with
respect
to
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
sir
there
was.
and
the
--
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
sir.
the
judge
found
--
judge
johnson
found
that
whatever
mr.
lill
told
judge
kennamer
was
not
full
and
that
finding
was
approved
by
both
three
circuit
court
judges.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
vitiated
the
sentence.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
do
not
now
try
to
--
mr.
leon
silverman
at
most,
though
we're
in
that
posture
before
this
court,
i
think
that
i
would
be
arguing
that
this
was
at
most
a
technical
violation
of
the
--
of
the
rule
that
is
that
the
judge
heard
it
before
rather
than
after
sentence.
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
i
submit
sir
that
what
happened
here
and
what
offended
perhaps
the
--
the
circuit
court
was
the
--
not
the
untruth
of
whatever
mr.
lill
may
have
told
the
--the
trial
--
the
trial
judge
because
that
was
all
true.
and
judge
johnson
developed
it
on
his
own
before
the
resentence
that
admissions
from
the
defendant.
but
that
there
was
something
wrong
about
a
man
imposing
sentence
having
gained
information
in
--
in
a
way
that
the
rule
did
not
contemplate.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
if
there
was
any
injury
to
this
defendant,
the
injury
was
occasioned
only
in
the
sentence.
and
in
the
next
sets
of
caution
perhaps
it
said,
“we
will
do
away
with
the
injury
that
may
have
been
caused
here.
and
we
will
have
this
man
go
back
and
be
resentenced.”
and
indeed
that
is
what
happened
that
is
--
it
was
pointed
out.
12
years
was
taken
from
the
sentence.
mr.
leon
silverman
but
justice
--
justice
harlan
i
would
say
--
mr.
leon
silverman
well
i
would
say
that
although
the
court
used
that
language,
what
they
meant
was
clear
from
what
they
did.
and
they
could
not
have
meant
the
literal
word
that
they
used.
but
whether
they
had
or
no,
i
think
that
this
court
may
inspect
the
transcript
and
find
that
--
and
i
believe
will
find
that
what
happened
before
judge
kennamer
at
the
time
of
the
sentence
was
not
wholly
appropriate
and
proper
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
beg
your
pardon,
at
the
time
of
the
taking
of
the
plea
and
sentence
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
on
a
monday
morning.
mr.
leon
silverman
the
waiver
of
indictment,
the
waiver
of
counsel,
the
plea
and
the
sentence.
i'm
sure
this
--
when
i
say
i'm
sure
i'm
over
speaking.
i
--
i
submit
to
this
court
that
an
inspection
of
that
record
will
convince
this
court
on
its
own
whatever
that
the
circuit
court
may
have
done.
but
this
was
all
together
fair.
and
what
--
mr.
leon
silverman
sir?
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
suppose
that
this
court
would
then
send
it
back.
the
man
would
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty
and
stand
trial.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes
sir,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
else
--
mr.
leon
silverman
--
this
court
would
do.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
leon
silverman
that
is
what
i
submit
to
the
court
would
happen.
i
--
i
can't
predict
what
form
of
the
order
would
take
but
i
think
that
that
would
proper
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
silverman
we
then
raise
the
problem
which
i
have
not
found
an
answer
to,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
if
this
information
is
dismissed
for
a
defect
for
example.
clearly,
whether
or
not
one
can
re-indict
because
the
rule
states
or
that
the
statute
states
that
an
indictment
dismissed
for
a
--
an
irregularity
would
sustain
a
--
a
subsequent
indictment
within
the
next
successive
term
of
--
of
the
grand
jury.
the
rule
is
of
the
silence
as
to
what
would
happen
to
an
information
that
was
dismissed
on
that
ground,
i
have
found
no
enlightenment
--.
mr.
leon
silverman
i'm
sorry
but
i
can't
answer
the
question.
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
have
not
looked
that
up.
i
would
then
sum
up
my
argument
in
--
in
this
way.
but
first,
due
process
was
accorded
to
this
defendant.
it
was
accorded
to
him
that
when
the
district
judge,
judge
johnson
resentenced
him
taking
care
of
whatever
may
have
been
the
ill
effects
of
the
conversation
between
agent
lill
and
judge
kennamer,
every
other
part
of
the
proceeding,
we
submit,
was
absolutely
proper
and
fully
accorded
to
the
defendant
his
rights
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
government
could
proceed
by
information,
i
think
i
would
be
laboring
the
obvious
if
i
repeated
the
three
arguments
that
i
made
before.
i
would
submit
that
the
government
has
proceeded
in
this
case
with
perfect
propriety
that
the
defendant
has
nothing
to
complain
of
in
terms
of
what
rights
were
given
him
or
denied
him
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
