justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
gather
from
the
fact
here,
an
information
that
was
not
an
indictment,
that's
the
point
upon
which
you
rest
your
challenge
to
jurisdiction
that
this
should
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
been
an
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
should
have
been
indicted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
a
capital
offense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
--
the
only
evidence
as
to
injury
is
that
there
was
an
absence
of
any
signs
of
physical
injury,
is
that
it?
but
the
way
you
suggest
of
then
other
kinds
of
injury
at
least
the
jury
could
have
so
found
that
it's
gone
to
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
you
prevail
in
that
issue
that's
the
end
of
your
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
moore
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
hasn't
been
that
accurate.
your
real
complaint,
is
it
not,
is
with
what
was
appended
to
the
judgment
on
motion
for
rehearing.
in
effect
aren't
you
saying
that
in
light
of
the
finding
of
a
sentence
obtained
for
lack
of
due
process,
it
was
utterly
void,
of
no
effect
and
therefore
that
we
had
to
start
of
--
the
government
had
to
start
all
over
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
appended
this
discretion
to
the
district
judge
the
ends
of
--
now,
that
justice
may
require,
whatever
that
language
was,
to
permit
or
not
to
permit
the
defendant
to
withdraw
his
waiver
of
counsel.
they
added
something
which
on
the
premise
of
their
judgment
they
had
no
jurisdiction
assigned
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
might
--
why
do
you
emphasize
then
this
discussion
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
fbi
agent
in
what
significance
there
is.
if
you're
right
that
this
in
effect
was
the
--
the
finding
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
it's
sole
purpose
in
effect
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
plea
of
guilty
at
all
is
still
outstanding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore
that
was
added
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
why
do
you
emphasize
the
--
why
do
you
emphasize
the
interview?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
this
is
the
information
that
have
been
in
the
form
of
an
indictment
and
is
not
on
the
trial
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
aren't
you
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
were
under
such
an
indictment
shows
no
harm
or
(inaudible)
and
it
might
be
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
before
you
go
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
that
mr.
silverman,
don't
you
have
to
meet
this
argument
though
that
mr.
moore
made?
that
when
you
read
what
it
was
that
was
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
before
the
judgment
was
amended,
in
effect
what
was
said
was,
the
conviction
had
a
constitutional
infirmity
in
it
for
the
many
reasons
stated
which
had
the
consequence
of
making
it
utterly
void.
and
that
the
fact
was
the
fact,
this
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
resentance
on
a
--
in
respect
to
a
void
conviction,
it's
just
something
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
allowed
the
district
court
to
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
maybe
i
am.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
said,
that's
the
argument
that
was
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
page
268
of
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
268
of
the
record.
is
that
it
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
in
the
footnote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
under
those
circum
--
under
those
circumstances,
i
presume,
is
the
information
amendable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
