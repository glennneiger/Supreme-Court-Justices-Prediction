mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
which
has
been
in
the
federal
courts
throughout
its
entire
life.
in
november
1949,
johnny
ray
smith
was
apprehended
under
the
osceola
hotel
in
geneva,
alabama
by
the
fbi.
he
and
two
others,
who
later
became
his
codefendants,
were
carried
to
dothan
where
they
were
arraigned
and
incarcerated.
they
--
this
was
on
a
friday.
they
were
questioned
that
night
in
saturday
and
sunday,
and
right
in
the
early
monday
morning,
the
21st
day
of
november,
1949,
they
were
carried
to
montgomery.
there,
they
had
a
conference
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
and
during
that
time
or
some
time
during
the
morning
while
they
were
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office,
fbi
agent
john
lill
went
to
the
chambers
of
judge
charles
kennamer,
presiding
judge,
and
had
a
conference
with
him
about
this
matter.
shortly
thereafter,
judge
kennamer
went
on
the
bench,
johnny
ray
smith
and
his
two
defendants
--
codefendants,
who
were
two
17-year-old
boys,
johnny
ray
was
26,
went
into
the
courtroom.
and
in
the
words
of
the
fifth
circuit
after
a
few
didactic
questions,
all
three
defendants
pled
guilty.
whereupon,
the
judge
says,
“i
have
discussed
this
matter
with
mr.
lill,”
meaning
the
fbi
agent
and
immediately
proceeded
to
pronounce
sentences,
30
years
to
johnny
ray
and
15
years
to
each
of
the
two
17-year-old
boys.
now,
smith
was
incarcerated
in
the
federal
prison
system
and
finally
was
sent
to
california
to
alcatraz.
he
there
initiated
a
petition,
a
--
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
and
it
got
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
there.
they
told
him
he
had
the
wrong
remedy,
that
he
should
be
proceeding
under
2255.
thereupon,
he
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
alabama
after
making
due
motions
to
judge
kennamer.
the
fifth
circuit
of
alabama
of
the
fifth
--
not
of
alabama
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
circuit,
granted
him
this
relief
under
2255
and
ordered
a
hearing.
at
that
stage,
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
appointed
by
the
court
to
come
in
to
defend
the
man's
rights.
we
had
a
full
hearing
with
the
petitioner
being
brought
from
alcatraz
and
then
the
presiding
district
judge
decided
we
were
entitled
to
no
relief
so
we
went
to
the
--
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
in
238
f.
2d
925,
they
issued
another
opinion.
we
thought
we
had
won
our
lawsuit
at
that
point.
they
decided
that
when
it
comes
to
the
controlling
question
whether
or
not
the
waivers
and
the
plea
was
taken
in
violation
of
due
process,
that
it
was.
and
in
the
opinion
they
set
out
a
number
of
reasons
why
they
thought
it
was.
then
the
judgment
is
reversed,
the
cause
is
remanded
with
directions
to
grant
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
conviction
and
sentence
and
to
proceed
further
and
not
inconsistently,
herewith.
the
united
states
attorney
saw
fit
to
file
for
rehearing.
the
rehearing
was
refused
but
the
court
added
a
further
sentence
in
addition
to
what
i
just
read,
including
if
the
district
judge
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
ends
of
justice
required
it,
permitting
the
defendant
to
withdraw
his
waiver
of
counsel
and
his
plea
of
guilty,
and
to
stand
trial.
we
went
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
again
--
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
again,
and
pointed
out
that
we
thought
it
was
quite
inconsistent
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
to
say,
the
due
--
due
process
has
not
been
granted
because
of
the
waivers
and
these
other
matters
which
i'm
going
to
bring
up
that
we
thought
we
were
entitled
to
more
relief
but
we
didn't
get
it.
hence,
we
are
here.
now,
what
our
district
did
--
judge
did,
when
the
case
was
sent
back
to
him
with
these
instructions,
was
the
following.
when
the
case
was
called
we
appeared
and
he
did
remove
--
he
followed
the
court
in
removing
the
conviction
and
the
sentence.
as
the
man
stood
before
the
court,
with
the
conviction
and
sentence
removed,
we
asked
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
which
was
refused.
we
then
asked
to
withdraw
our
plea
of
guilty,
which
was
refused.
then
we
asked
to
withdraw
the
waivers
of
indictment
of
counsel
and
venue
which
was
refused.
then
as
he
stood
before
the
court,
based
on
this
plea
he
had
made
in
1949,
the
court
sentenced
him
to
10
additional
years.
the
man
had
been
in
jail
eight
years
at
that
time.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
judge
frank
johnson
was
appointed
and
this
is
his
first
case
that
he
had
heard
since
he
went
on
the
bench.
and
he
had
heard
the
entire
2255.
when
it
came
back
to
him,
he
reduced
the
sentence
on
the
fact
we
had
a
30-year
sentence
to
start
with.
the
man
had
served
eight
years.
the
judge
took
cognizance
of
eight
years
and
resentenced
the
man
to
an
additional
10
years
from
that
date,
which
he
is
serving
at
this
time.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
he
did.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
judge
kennamer
passed
on
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
and
judge
frank
johnson
was
appointed.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
get
into
that
right
now.
there's
--
that
there's
a
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well
i
claim
some
other
things
other
than
that
if
it
please
the
court
and
which
i
want
to
get
to
right
now
if
i
may.
and
i
--
i
want
quite
fully.
in
the
first
place,
i
say
that
this
court,
under
the
proceeding
that
they
had,
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
the
reasons
to
these.
this
case
is
a
kidnapping
case
and
it's
--
it's
a
federal
law.
it's
the
lindbergh
law,
section
1201.
and
under
that
case
the
man
is
accused
of
a
capital
crime.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well,
he
is
accused,
if
it
please
the
court,
whether
or
not
it
proved
or
not,
it's
unless.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
do
not.
under
the
parrino
case
if
it
does
not
specify
whether
the
man
did
or
did
not
release
the
victim
unharmed,
he
can
be
found
guilty
of
a
capital
crime.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
a
jury
question
of
a
fact
where
he
was
or
was
not
released
unharmed.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
that's
what
the
parrino
case
holds
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
exactly.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that
is
exactly
our
contention,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
and
i'm
--
and
i'm
going
to
tell
you
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
why,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes.
it
--
it
was
an
affirmation
in
this
case
and
i
say
that
the
united
states
attorney
has
no
authority
by
which
he
can
bring
in
information.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
because
it's
a
capital
offense
and
the
only
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right,
i
know.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
the
rule
--
rule
7
(b)
of
the
federal
criminal
rules,
only
allows
an
information
where
the
offense
is
not
capital.
i
hadn't
answered
your
question
yet,
and
i
realized
it.
but
as
the
first
step
in
this,
in
--
in
our
contention,
it
--
if
this
is
in
fact
a
capital
case,
then
there
is
no
way
by
which
the
united
states
attorney
can
start
this
by
an
information.
and
i
--
i've
got
to
convince
you
of
that
first,
at
least
i
mean
i've
got
to
make
that
point.
that
this
is
a
capital
case
or
can
be
a
capital
case,
because
by
the
very
nature
of
things
the
man
can
be
found
guilty
--
is
this
what
he's
charged
with,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that's
what
he
did,
even
though
it
was
by
an
information.
then
the
judge
can
ask
for
a
jury,
and
the
jury
can
find
that
the
victim
was
not
released
unharmed.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
that's
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
i
doubt,
of
course,
if
it
please
the
court.
he
might
have
even
been
home
in
bed
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
and
not
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
and
--
and
then
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
complete
the
answer.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
any
information
is
just
like
the
indictment.
it's
got
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
contest
that
violently
in
that
that
this
man
has
never
been
tried.
under
the
parker
case
you
could
take
evidence
to
see
what
sort
of
punishment
he's
going
to
get
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
but
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
it
never
--
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
could
ever
come
before
the
court
to
be
determined
properly.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
there
were
no
physical
marks
on
the
man.
whether
he
received
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
a
mental
trauma,
i
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
don't
know.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
unless
the
jury
had
disagreed
with
the
findings
in
this
case
and
thought
that
his
--
by
being
frightened
he
was
harmed
and
had
seen
fit
to
recommend
the
death
penalty,
which
is
entirely
within
the
realm
of
possibility
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
yes,
sir.
on
this
2255,
i
raised
a
point
on
page
66
of
the
transcript
that
we
should
not
have
gone
into
the
evidence
of
the
kidnapping
in
this
2255
it
--
it
was
not
proper
at
that
time.
we
have
taken
evidence,
so
to
speak,
which
should
have
been
presented
in
the
trial,
and
if
we'd
had
a
trial
we'd
try
the
case
a
different
way.
so
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
what
is
he
charged
for?
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
we
have
to.
that's
right,
if
you
start
relying
on
what
the
attorney
is
going
to
charge
your
client
with
the
opposing
attorney
well
you–
certainly
weaken
your
position.
that's
one
issue
in
--
this
--
that's
the
first
issue
in
this
case.
the
second
issue
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
and
the
judge
rives,
in
the
lower
court
in
the
minority
opinion
adopted
that
position
all
the
way
through.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
try
your
lawsuit
to
--
to
see
what
your
choice
is
with
and
that's
what
it
makes
us
do.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
he
was
the
original
sentencing
judge,
judge
kennemar.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
that's
what
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
the
position
and
that's
point
number
one.
point
number
two,
if
i
may
go
into
it,
sir
is
the
fact
that
an
fbi
agent
acting
in
line
and
scope
of
his
duty
as
an
fbi
agent
and
in
no
other
capacity,
and
of
the
chambers
of
the
judge
who
was
later
the
sentencing
judge,
and
the
record
will
reveal
that
he
had
a
good
bit
to
say
about
--
about
this
man,
about
his
alleged
confession,
about
this
crime,
about
other
crimes,
information
he
got
from
another
fbi
agent,
and
a
rather
full
report.
now,
the
record
would
also
show
that
mr.
lill
went
to
california
when
the
habeas
corpus
was
held
and
had
a
good
bit
to
say
at
that
time
about
this
and
gave
testimony
our
there.
at
that
time
there
was
some
talk
about
a
presentence
report
and
the
government
has
made
quite
a
point
out
of
the
fact
that
what
difference
does
it
make
if
this
information
was
given
before
instead
of
after.
our
answer
to
that
is
this.
mr.
lill
was
never
giving
information
in
the
form
of
a
presentence
report.
mr.
lill
admitted,
off
on
my
examination
in
montgomery
that
we
had
a
probation
service
there.
he
knew
the
probation
officers
by
name.
we
didn't
have
to
--
the
court
didn't
have
to
go
to
an
fbi
agent
to
--
to
get
a
presentence
report.
mr.
lill
never
left
his
job
as
an
fbi
agent
as
this
court
held
in
von
moltke
case.
it's
laudable
for
a
--
a
government
agent
to
be
a
government
agent
but
at
the
same
time,
he
can't
work
for
both
sides
of
the
street.
williams
case
was
brought
out
this
morning
and
there
a
probation
officer
and
the
probation
report
is
certainly
supposed
to
be
giving
the
full
truth,
picture
and
possibly
be
the
man's
protector
if,
possible.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
it
was
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
it
wasn't
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
was
a
--
a
big
victory
to
say
the
least
and
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
what
it
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes.
that's
--
it
--
that
--
yes,
sir,
that
--
frankly.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
a
conviction
and
the
plea
as
judge
rives
has
pointed
out
in
--
in
some
of
his
opinions
--
in
one
of
these
other
opinions
he
gave,
are
--
are
all
tied
together.
and
i
think
if
i
go
in
to
my
third
point
in
some
detail,
it
will
answer
your
question.
my
point
--
my
third
point
is
that,
as
of
right
now,
it's
a
law
of
the
land
as
given
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
this
man
was
deprived
of
due
process
in
the
taking
of
all
these
waivers
and
the
plea
and
this
sentence.
and
it's
all
tied
up
in
one
package.
and
you
can't
just
set
aside
a
conviction
and
turn
around
and
give
him
a
new
sentence.
it's
all
part
of
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well,
of
course
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
we
don't
even
know
what
information
was
given.
for
example,
that
this
fbi
agent
didn't
remember
bringing
the
man
from
dothan
to
montgomery
in
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
i
think
it's
right.
yes.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
there
--
there
are
some
indication
that
the
conferences
that
they
had
had,
with
these
two
younger
boys
thought
they
were
going
on
the
juvenile
act
and
get
10
years
and
they
were
advised
later
that
they
weren't,
but
they
still
are
going
to
the
court
of
--
the
lower
court
could
have
been
holding
to
talks
and
promises
based
on
that
which
was
unsaid
or
rather
as
to
which
was
said.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well
the
court
of
appeals,
if
it
please
your
honor,
in
230
f.
2d
925,
the
first
opinion
that
they
ruled
after
we
raised
these
various
questions
in
there,
didn't
divide
them
at
all,
didn't
divide
them
apart
at
all
and
--and
i
read
there
briefly
from
what
they
said.
“when
it
comes
to
the
controlling
question
however,
which
the
motion
presents
whether
under
the
undisputed
facts,
the
defendant
was
denied
due
process
in
the
taking
of
his
waivers
in
plea,
the
matter
stands
quite
differently.
and
because
it
is
clear
that
it
was
not
accorded
to
him,
the
judgment
must
be
reversed.
this
is
so
because
considering
the
inordinate
haste,
the
inordinate
speed,
they
encountered
haste
with
which
the
defendants
were
brought
up
for
hearing,
the
trial
moved
to
face
the
fact
that
the
government
prosecuting
agent
and
the
district
judge
before
the
defendant
had
made
any
waiver
or
pleaded,
indicate
in
the
course,
conferred
privately
in
chambers
with
the
prosecuting
agent
with
regard
to
defendant's
guilt
and
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
therefore
in
connection
with
both
what
was
said
and
done
and
what
was
left
unsaid
and
undone
by
the
judge
in
taking
the
waivers
and
the
plea
and
the
sentencing
the
defendant.
we
are
left
in
no
doubt
that
the
move
was
not
accorded
but
was
denied
due
process
and
the
judgment
and
sentence
may
not
stand.so
it's
all
tied
in
together.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
i
recognize
what
you're
saying
and
--and
i
can't
answer
it
separately
without
taking
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
and
say
that
all
came
out
together
based
on
this
thing.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes
it
makes
an
awful
lot
of
difference.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
and
as
judge
rives
took
issue
with
that
and
he
said
the
position
is
incompatible
and
--
and
it's
beyond
comprehension,
how
you
can
say
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
these
things
violate
due
process.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
if
i'm
right
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
if
i
am
right
on
that
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
it's
time
to
quit
then
but
i've
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well,
of
course
that's
a
--
well
the
presentence
report
is
what
you're
--
you're
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
talking
about.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
but
that
the
fbi
man
is
certainly
not
a
part
of
the
probation
service.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
quite
the
probation.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
please
this
honorable
court.
(inaudible)
brief
rebuttal
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
i'm
very
--
very
much
appreciate,
sir.
i
don't
intend
to
go
beyond
4:30.
i
think
just
a
brief
summation
of
my
points
and
then
i'll
answer
that.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
in
answer
to
the
government
position
or
notice,
he
said
that
it
would
--
we
would
--
that's
give
us
notice.
the
first
thing
before
we
got
that
notice,
we'd
have
to
have
a
waiver
of
indictment.
and
when
the
indictment
was
waived,
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
know
what
the
united
states
attorney
is
going
through.
i
think
judge
rives
does
it
very
nicely
here
with
rule
7.
while
rule
7
vests
a
wide
discretion
in
the
united
states
attorney
and
frees
him
from
the
necessity
of
obtaining
leave
of
the
court
in
case
it's
properly
prosecuted
by
information,
its
language
leaves
no
doubt
that
such
uncontrolled
discretion
does
not
include
the
right
to
preclude
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
any
case
which
might
possibly
be
so
punished.
a
discretion
which
could
therefore
be
finally
exercised
by
no
one
man
alone,
in
other
words,
the
whole
proposition
there
is
jurisdiction
above
all
other
matters.
most
exist
from
the
beginning
and
should
affirmatively
appear
of
record.
and
i
might
further
add
that
if
that
jurisdiction
did
not
exist,
then
the
case
falls
on
its
face
and
an
answer
to
what
you
justice
black
the
point
your
raise
as
to
what
could
be
the
possible
consequences
of
this
matter.
i
think
we
would
first
ask
this
honorable
court
to
determine
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
about
which
this
information
could
be
brought
or
no
--
no
way
why
that
--
by
which
this
information
could
be
brought.
therefore
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
i
will
not
go
back
into
the
parrino
case
in
any
detail
because
i'm
sure
the
court
will
make
a
determination
and
that
case
would
either
stand
or
fall
on
one
of
our
interpretations.
we
think
the
statute
of
limitations
that
--
that
the
honorable
chief
justice,
the
question
he
raised
there
they
have
to
discuss
by
judge
hand
in
that
particular
case.
therefore
we
would
ask
this
honorable
court
that
it'd
be
determined
that
the
united
states
attorney
have
no
way
and
since
this
is
a
capital
case,
since
a
man
could
be
punished
by
death,
to
commence
his
action.
if
he
had
no
way
to
commence
the
action,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
within
the
court.
secondly,
we
would
--
in
the
event
that
we
did
not
prevail
in
that
position,
we
would
like
to
urge
that
the
lower
court
was
quite
right
in
determining
that
this
man
had
not
properly
waived
his
right
to
counsel,
venue
and
jurisdiction.
and
that
therefore
these
other
two
things
which
followed
in
consequence
his
plea,
i
think
you
--
we
can
put
them
all
in
one
package
and
follow
1,
2,
3,
4,
5
--
10
pins
practically.
then
that
plea
as
well
as
the
conviction
must
be
set
aside.
and
that
that
is
defining
and
is
the
law
as
announced
by
the
fifth
circuit
at
this
time.
therefore
if
we
do
not
prevail
(inaudible)
to
jurisdiction,
we
would
think
that
the
lower
court
could
not
--
it
had
a
situation
that
was
impossible
to
follow.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“these
things
were
taken
in
violation
of
due
process.”
then
they
said
--
set
aside
the
sentence
and
proceed
not
inconsistent
therewith.
well,
it
is
certainly
inconsistent
to
find
that
a
man
has
been
deprived
of
due
process
by
certain
things
he's
done,
namely,
these
waivers
and
not
to
follow
through
and
say
that
all
the
waivers
and
the
plea
and
the
convictions
should
all
be
set
aside.
that
would
be
our
second
request.
if
the
court
got
that
far
that
all
the
pleas
and
the
waivers
be
set
aside
for
a
violation
of
due
process
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
made
many
other
which
is
on
due
process
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
sir,
we
have
discussed
that
many
times
and
--
and
i
don't
know
and
the
united
states
attorney
doesn't
know
himself.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well,
there
is
--
there
is
a
statute
of
limitation
on
a
non-capital
case,
that's
correct.
it's
just
like
in
a
non-capital
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
the
five
years
has
expired
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
since
that
time.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
so
that
it's
(inaudible)
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well,
if
the
plea
--
and
if
--
well,
by
this
i
will
--
i
would
say
that
his
waiver
of
--
of
indictment
has
to
fall
within
the
same
basket
because
his
waiver
of
indictment,
his
waiver
of
venue,
his
waiver
of
counsel
and
the
plea
all
go
together.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
i
have.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
i
have
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
seen
him
maybe
from
--
from
california
to
florida.
he's
got
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
45-year
sentence
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
before
going
down
there.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
but
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
no
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right.
he
could
--
he
could
still
be
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
he
could
be
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
--
indicted
for
a
capital
offense
and
be
tried
for
a
capital
offense.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
well,
i
conceive
that
he
could
also
--
he
could
get
a
death
sentence.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
--
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
that's
right,
because
all
those
waivers
and
the
plea
go
together
in
that
particular
ground
to
the
--
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
yes,
that's
my
whole
position.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
i
have
stated
everything
i
have
to
say.
if
there
are
further
questions
i'll
try
to
answer
them,
otherwise
i
thank
you
for
your
indulgence.
mr.
william
b.
moore,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
