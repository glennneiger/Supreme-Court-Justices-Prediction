justice
potter
stewart
mr.
moore,
haven't
you
already
run
--
won
in
that
aspect
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
they
--
they
agreed
with
you.
they
said
that
this
procedure
impacted
the
validity
of
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
deceased
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
sentence
has
been
set
aside
and
this
man
has
now
been
resentenced,
too,
with
a
shorter
sentence
by
a
judge
who
was
not
subjected
to
that
kind
of
misleading
and
perhaps
improper
information.
justice
potter
stewart
so
is
that
--
is
that
before
us
now?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
tell
us
why?
justice
potter
stewart
what
appears
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
are
12
years
in
prison
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
counting
the
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
since
you
divided
it
in
--
into
three
points,
let
me
continue
for
a
moment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
least
--
to
do
the
same
thing.
and
on
the
second
point
which
involves
the
information
or
perhaps
misinformation
given
to
the
sentencing
judge
by
the
fbi
agent.
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
that
have
affected
or
infected
anything
else
but
the
--
but
the
sentence
imposed?
justice
potter
stewart
that
had
nothing
else
to
do
with
this
waiver
of
an
indictment
or
of
his
plea
of
guilty
or
of
his
waiver
of
counsel,
didn't
it
or
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
that
time
is,
this
was
misinformation
now,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
along
that
the
lines
of
your
--
what
you're
just
arguing
have
you
a
third
string
to
your
bow?
to
the
effect
that
the
very
fact
that
the
government
proceeded
by
information
rather
than
by
indictment
gave
notice
to
this
defendant
that
this
was
not
an
offense
punishable
by
death?
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
is
the
hardship
there
really?it's
just
a
difference
of
whether
he's
languishing
in
jail
or
languishing
in
prison
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
districts
where
the
grand
jury
meets
maybe
twice
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right
now.
justice
potter
stewart
that
now
as
the
rule
7
also
expressed
that
considered
public
policy
that
in
cases
where
the
punishment
might
be
execution,
that
this
inconvenience
and
this
hardship
of
being
in
jail
as
long
as
five
or
six
months
is
countered
--
more
than
counter-balanced
by
the
importance
and
necessity
of
having
a
man
charged
with
an
offense
as
serious
as
that
only
by
action
of
the
--
of
the
grand
jury
and
--
almost
weighing
the
--
the
gravity
of
the
eventual
punishment
against
the
--
a
few
months
in
jail
as
a
--
as
a
de
minimis
situation
in
that
kind
of
an
offense.

potter
