number

johnny
ray
smith,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
moore,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose,
mr.
moore,
it
would
be
analogous
--
somewhat
analogous
would
it
not
to
situation
where
a
man
is
--
is
charged
with
murder
but
was
by
an
information
under
which,
of
course,
he
could
be
executed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
--
he
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
your
position
would
be
of
course
that
--
that
the
information
would
be
invalid
because
he
might
have
been
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
instead
of
second
degree
murder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
you
could
also
say
that
unless
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you
could
also
say
that
in
--
in
the
posture
of
this
case
you're
not
even
chargeable
with
notice
of
what
the
prosecution
might
have
--
might
have
attempted
to
prove
against
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
silverman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
suppose
mr.
silverman,
he
was
charged
with
murder
and
the
government
had
no
intention
of
proving
anything
except
a
second
degree
murder
because
you
couldn't
prove
actual
intent
and
the
--
and
the
fact
showed
that,
could
you
convict
the
man
on
an
information
rather
than
an
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
--
you
just
charge
him
with
murder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now
let's
put
it
this
way.
you
charge
him
with
--
you
charge
with
murder
in
a
manner
under
which
he
could
be
convicted
of
either
first
degree
murder
or
second
degree
murder.
and
the
government
made
no
attempt
to
prove
a
first
degree
murder
but
proved
a
second
degree
murder.
and
it
had
been
done
by
the
--
by
information
rather
than
an
indictment,
would
that
have
been
good?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let
me
put
it
this
way.
this
might
be
a
little
more
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
thinking.
the
government
charges
a
--a
person
with
the
crime
of
murder
in
terms
that
would
justify
his
conviction
of
either
first
degree
murder
or
second
degree
murder,
and
then
the
--
the
government
goes
into
court
and
says
to
the
--
to
the
court,
“your
honor,
we
have
no
intention
of
trying
to
establish
a
capital
offense
here.
we
are
--
we
are
satisfied
that
the
defendant
only
committed
a
second
degree
murder.”
and
the
defendant
then
says,
“in
those
circumstances,
i
will
plead
guilty
to
the
--
to
second
degree
murder
under
the
information.”
would
that
be
right
going
and
--and
could
he
then
waive
in
that
manner
the
right
to
be
charged
by
an
indictment
rather
than
an
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
could
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
--
and
then
get
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
silverman
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
silverman,
suppose
this
information
had
been
filed
after
the
time
limit
for
the
filing
of
--
of
an
information
of
indictment
in
a
normal
felony
case,
not
a
capital
case,
would
the
statute
of
limitations
be
open
to
the
defendant
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
probably
a
felony
case.
yes,
that
was
--
well,
just
an
ordinary
felony
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
this
information
had
been
filed
beyond
that
time
limit?
would
the
statute
limitations
be
--
the
defense
be
open
to
the
man
in
this
case
with
this
kind
of
an
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'd
say
it
would
be
open,
right.
why?
because
under
no
circumstances
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
be,
because
under
no
circumstances,
could
he
be
convicted
of
a
capital
offense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
didn't
understand
to
say
before
that
--
that
you
thought
under
no
circumstances
could
he
have
been
convicted
of
a
capital
offense
under
this
kind
of
an
information.
chief
justice
earl
warren
see
my
trouble
--
my
trouble
is
that
it
seems
to
me
you
both
--
you
both
embrace
at
the
same
time
reject
the
language
of
--
of
judge
hand
when
he
said
this
court
within
petitioner's
brief,
we
agree
that
the
indictment
stated
all
the
essentials
of
the
crime
as
charged,
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
allege
that
the
victim
was
not
released
unharmed
in
order
that
the
jury
might
recommend
the
death
penalty.
we,
too,
think
that
the
indictment
need
not
allege
whether
the
victim
had
been
released
unharmed.
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
--
i
wish
you
would
if
could
in
a
--
in
few
words,
tell
me
how
you
construe
this
language
to
--
to
support
this
information.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
was
--
if
the
least
language
is,
that
the
information
did
not
say
that
he
was
unharmed.
and
judge
hand
said
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
did
not
say
that
he
was
unharmed,
the
jury
had
the
right
to
find
him
guilty
of
a
capital
offense.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
is
within
this
language.
now
if
he
--
because
he
goes
on
to
say,
“we
too
think
that
the
indictment
need
not
allege
whether
the
victim
had
been
released
unharmed,”
now
it
may
be
there
are
other
language
in
there
and
if
you
say
that
there's
language
that
qualifies
this,
i
won't
trouble
you
to
read
it
because
i'll
read
it
myself.
but
i
would
talk
to
you
about
this
language
that
was
quoted
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i
was
trying
to
--
i
was
trying
to
confine
it
to
parrino
for
the
moment.
maybe
we
get
to
this
point.
but
if
you
say
there's
other
language
in
there
that
qualifies
that
out,
i'll
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'll
get
it
for
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
don't
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
in
your
--
where
in
your
brief
do
you
argue
that
third
--
that
third
string?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
that
manner
would
--
would
prevent
a
--
a
capital
verdict.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
saw
only
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
saw
only
two
issues
here.
one
of
them
is
that
permission
to
withdraw
petitioner's
waivers
of
his
procedural
rights,
his
plea
of
guilty
voluntarily
and
intelligently
made
was
properly
refused.
and
the
second
part
is
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
proceed
by
information
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
i'd
--
i'd
just
like
to
know
where
your
third
string
is
that,
namely,
that
if
they
did
proceed
this
way,
that
under
no
circumstances
could
be
--
he
be
convicted
of
a
capital
offense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
due
process,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moore,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moore,
our
adjournment
time
is
4:30
but
we
realize
that
you
are
--
you
are
here
without
any
compensation
that
you're
representing
this
indigent
defendant
and
if
it
would
accommodate
you
to
--
to
conclude
tonight
even
though
it
takes
us
somewhat
after
4:30,
we'd
be
glad
to
accommodate
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
moore,
i
have
no
questions.
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
court
appreciates
very
much
the
service
that
you've
rendered
to
this
indigent
defendant.
you
had
a
long,
hard
struggle
and
those
have
been
a
great
sacrifice
to
you.
and
we
always
feel
comforted
by
the
fact
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
do
that.
i
may
say
to
you
that
we're
comforted
by
the
fact
that
for
the
last
10
days
that
we've
been
hearing
arguments
and
had
possibly
a
dozen
criminal
cases,
and
you
attend
to
them,
lawyers
from
all
parts
of
the
country
are
coming
to
represent
defendants
as
you
have
because
they
were
poor
and
that's
a
great
contribute,
it
seems
to
us,
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
country.
so,
without
regard
to
the
outcome
of
your
case,
we
appreciate
your
services.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
silverman,
we
of
course
appreciate
the
very
earnest
representation
that
you
have
made
on
behalf
of
(inaudible)
of
the
united
states.
we'll
adjourn.
