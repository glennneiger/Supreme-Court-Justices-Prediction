justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
--
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
if
you
haven't
--
whatever
the
validity
of
your
position
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
under
no
circumstances
no
matter
what
this
indictment
is
charged
could
this
man
have
been
sentenced
to
death,
thus
the
victim
was
unharmed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there's
no
dispute
here
that
this
man
--
this
victim
of
the
kidnapping
was
released
unharmed,
is
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
dispute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
just
asking
you
what
the
fact
is.
is
there
any
dispute
on
that
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
fact
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
actual
facts
are
that
no
matter
what
this
indictment
has
alleged
or
the
information
it
alleged,
this
man
could
not
have
been
given
a
capital
sentence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that's
the
--
that's
the
--
the
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
in
this
case
the
sentencing
judge,
judge
kennemar
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
judge
johnson.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
question
in
the
record
that
he
was
(voice
overlap)
that
a
capital
sentence
could
not
be
imposed
here.
he
said
the
maximum
sentence
and
you
realize
(voice
overlap)
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
really
the
nub
of
the
situation
between
you
and
the
government
is,
whether
this
requirement
of
rule
7
is
to
be
judged
in
terms
of
the
actual
facts
in
a
particular
case
as
to
whether
a
death
sentence
could
have
been
given,
or
in
terms,
as
you
claim,
as
to
what
the
or
what
the
information
charges.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
position
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
would
have
to
be,
i
take
it,
that
in
any
situation
where
there
was
no
dispute,
no
dispute
whatever,
that
a
death
sentence
could
not
be
imposed
still,
the
district
attorney
if
he
wants
to
proceed
by
information
in
order
to
get
a
waiver
of
the
indictment
has
got
to
allege
in
the
indictment
--
in
the
information
as
the
man
was
unharmed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
effect
of
the
sentence
(inaudible)
because
under
the
rule
itself
with
that
type
of
information
would
have
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
showing
one
way
or
the
other
that
what
lill
said
to
judge
kennamer
was
true
or
untrue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
said
that
the
--
lill
conversation
(inaudible)
sentence
when
under
the
rule,
if
complied
with,
judge
kennamer
could
have
--
if
this
conversation
had
taken
place
ex
parte,
after
the
plea
but
before
a
sentence,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
rule.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
make
any
sense,
i
mean
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
the
rule
that
was
violated
and
the
rule
that's
entitled
to
have
a
sanction
irrespective
of
prejudice
and
non
prejudice,
it
seems
to
me
the
consequence
is
that
this
whole
thing
has
to
be
swept
out
and
--
and
start
all
over
again,
that
--
that
it
doesn't
provide
any
sanction
if
the
rule
is
to
say
we'll
wipe
out
the
sentence
and
leave
the
plea
on
the
--
standing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
impression
that
you
get
from
reading
the
earlier
court
of
appeals
is
taking
at
least
the
one
that
i
got.
was
it
what
outraged
him
so
much
was
the
fact
that
they
thought
that
judge
kennamer
had
rushed
this
fellow
into
a
plea.
and
if
you
stop
with
that
one
opinion
of
the
court,
why
--
that's
i
would
have
supposes
that
they
would
set
aside
the
whole
thing.
it's
only
when
you
get
this
surprise
move
--
the
surprise
clarification
in
the
rehearing,
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing
that
the
--
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
basis
that
this
--
the
basis,
the
final
basis
this
is
left
was,
seems
to
me
to
disappear
and
to
(inaudible)
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
statue
of
limitations
from
his
--
supposedly,
we
went
you
on
this
indictment
business
and
you
--
and
--
could
the
government
indict
him
again
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
non-capital
offense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
know
whether
there's
any
statute
of
limitations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
have
run
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
have
run
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
against
new
indictment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
expired.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there's
a
big
difference
between
your
two
positions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
consequences.
the
consequence
to
your
first
position
is
if
you're
right
on
the
waiver
business
of
the
indictment,
then
the
facts
being,
assuming
to
be
--
admittedly
being
that
this
was
none
--
the
--
the
victim
was
unharmed,
you
--
you
got
sprung
your
man,
hadn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
whereas
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
the
other
case,
you
got
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
new
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
i
understood.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
