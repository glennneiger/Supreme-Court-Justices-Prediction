justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
may
i
ask,
following
up
the
question
of
my
brother
black.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
didn't
the
--
the
matter
go
to
the
sentence
--
original
sentencing
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
that's
a
good
answer.
i
didn't
realize
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying,
mr.
moore
that
if
the
indictment
itself
alleges
that
in
fact
the
victim
was
unharmed,
there
could
by
no
possibility
be
a
capital
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
doesn't
say
so,
there
may
be
a
capital
sentence
although
the
victim
in
fact
was
unharmed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
mean
if
--
if
in
fact
the
indictment,
there
may
be
a
prosecution
for
and
a
conviction
of
the
lindbergh
offense
and
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence,
although
the
indictment
says
nothing
about
what
happened
to
the
victim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
but
if
the
indictment
itself
qualifies
it
by
saying
that
the
victim
was
unharmed,
then
there
couldn't
be
a
capital
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
prove
it
--
but
you
prove
it
because
of
what
you
and
i
went
through
of
what
happens
if
an
indictment
is
brought.
if
an
indictment
is
brought
which
merely
says
there
was
a
kidnapping,
period.
he
may
be
sentenced
to
death
on
a
showing
that
in
fact
the
victim
was
hurt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
--
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
you
can't
prove
that
the
information
that
you
can't
establish
that
the
charge
may
be
made
by
information,
by
--
or
the
fact
that
an
information
was
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
you
can't
--
that's
the
rule
7
says,
"an
offense
which
may
be
punished
by
death
shall
be
prosecuted
by
indictment."
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
question
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
offense
that's
charged,
not
until
you
prove
it's
an
allowable
information
prosecution
because
you
brought
and
information?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
begging
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
short
answer
to
justice
--
is
it
your
--
doesn't
your
position
require
you
to
say,
or
make
it
appropriate
for
you
to
say,
in
answer
to
the
question
of
brother
harlan
that
what
the
facts
are,
are
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
what
kind
of
an
offense
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
protection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
charged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
of
justice
harlan
by
which
he
replied
that
that's
the
issue?
whether
you
determine
or
whether
the
question
of
filing
a
charge
by
information
rather
than
requiring
an
indictment
to
say
that
that
is
the
requirement
of
the
rule
is
the
very
issue.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
that
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that
you're
limited
to
the
potential
charge
and
not
what
the
fact
in
a
particular
record
as
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
whether
his
plea
of
guilty
may
be
set
aside
and
he
needs
to
plead
not
guilty
in
going
to
the
trial,
rather
than
merely
have
his
sentence
readjusted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
do
you
--
if
i
may
ask,
why
do
you
rest
on
due
process?
why
do
you
have
to
go
that
far?
what
about
rule
32
(c)
(1)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
this
conference
has
had,
was
this
submission
to
the
court
in
chamber.
there's
a
judge
in
chambers,
was
outside
of
the
limitation
of
that
rule,
presents
his
investigation
when
made,
the
report
shall
not
be
submitted
to
the
court
where
its
contents
disclosed
31
unless
the
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty
or
has
been
found
guilty
and
all
that
took
place
here
(inaudible)
fbi
man
assuming
he's
part
of
the
probation
service
preceded
all
of
that,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he's
certainly
not
in
a
better
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
--
why
do
you
say
--
or
do
you
would
think
that
the
argument
is
concluded
by
saying,
this
is
notice
problem.
there
may
be
other
considerations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no
but
that
--
is
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
other
considerations
particular
in
the
federal
--
in
the
federal
penal
system
namely,
the
role
that
is
expected
to
be
played
by
--
by
the
process
or
the
procedure
with
indictment.
but
if
the
thing
has
contingency
that
seriously,
was
such
a
nature,
that
they
may
result
either
in
the
capital
sentence
or
beyond
infamous
crime
meaning
a
year
or
on
a
day,
whatever
it
is,
that
then
you
need
the
intervention
of
a
grand
jury
as
the
charging
body.
and
i
shouldn't
think
--
i
shouldn't
think
to
take
the
constitutional
provision
requiring
indictment
for
capital
or
other
infamous
offenses
--
crimes,
whatever
it
is
--
infamous
crime
that
if
congress
passed
a
statute
saying,
outlawing,
had
given
congress
to
say,
“if
it's
the
first
offense,
it
should
be
punished
by
six
months.
if
it's
the
second
offense,
then
it
should
be
punished
by
not
less
than
two
years.”
i
should
think
the
indictment
clearly
wouldn't
have
to
set
forth
what
it
is
to
impose
one
or
the
other
sentence.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
not.
the
second
thing,
the
consequences
of
the
offense
is
not
part
of
the
offense
charge,
it's
relevant
to
the
punishment.
and
therefore
if
the
potentiality
is
more
than
a
year
becomes
an
infamous
crime
and
i
don't
think
the
government
could
argue.
you
don't
have
to
indict
putting
labor
to
one
side
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
conceded
in
the
case
that
he
was
only
a
first
offender.
and
i
don't
see
why
the
same
argument
assuming
i'm
right
about
the
constitutional
construction,
doesn't
apply
to
the
federal
rule
namely,
it's
not
merely
a
concern
of
notice
to
the
defendant
but
also
the
kind
of
safeguard,
the
kind
of
conservative
safeguard,
in
all
whole
process
of
prosecution
that
are
deemed
relevant
to
a
crime
that
may
be,
on
the
fact,
not
going
in
through
in
advance
but
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution.
that
maybe,
that
may
end
in
death.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
we
have
a
problem
of
construction
in
the
light
of
the
whole
tradition
of
history
of
prosecutions
in
the
federal
system?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
raises
the
whole
--
of
course
if
you're
right,
that
an
indictment
charging
what
this
information
did
could
not
eventually
lead
in
death
that
it's
the
necessary
part
of
the
charge.
if
--
if
that
is
so,
if
that
were
established,
but
if
we
could
agree
on
that
or
conclude
that
--
that's
one
thing.
but
if
you
don't,
it's
a
very
different
thing
and
the
nice
distinction
that
you've
just
quoted,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
very
convincing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
statute
is
--
just
reading
your
statute,
i'm
inclined
to
find
the
convicting
proof
leading
to
that
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
very
low
to
go
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
case
usually
but
it
strikes
me
as
it'd
be
highly
undesirable
to
have
this
case
go
off
just
on
the
facts
in
this
case
and
leave
up
in
the
air
whether
informations
may
be
filed
in
these
cases.
so,
there's
a
general
question
presented
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(a)
--
(a)
is
it
necessary
to
be
charged
and
if
it's
included
in
his
deed
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
charged,
then
is
the
offense,
that
which
kidnapping
with
all
the
possible
consequences
and
therefore
not
is
a
measure
of
punishment
and
not
part
of
the
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
you
would
not
be
bound
by
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
would
be
bound
by
--
and
what
--
what
is
the
countervailing
consideration
of
putting
it
into
information
as
justice
black
suggests,
what
--
what
burden
or
inconvenience
does
that
cast
if
i'm
the
pleader?
and
if
it
is,
if
he
be
harmed
--
bound
by
it,
then
we
--
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
already
began.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
put
yourself
in
the
situation
of
a
u.s.
attorney,
who
doesn't
seem
like
you
do.
what
kind
of
feelings
would
prompt
the
u.s.
attorney
to
fix
about
it,
not
putting
it
in?
what
embarrassment
to
make
that
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
a
decision
that
if
you
don't
put
it
in,
then
there's
the
potentiality
of
a
capital
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
one
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
a
practical
or
does
one
have
--
does
one
go
on
with
his
imagination?
i
know
nothing
about
the
records
in
this
cases
but
it
seems
to
be
not
too
imaginative
to
assume
that
there
are
kidnapping
cases
in
which
an
indictment
for
one
reason
or
another
but
partly
for
the
reason
that
you
give
is
sought
to
be
secured
very
promptly.
and
the
state
of
the
victim
is
not
yet
determined
at
the
time
that
the
indictment
is
brought.
he
may
have
been
slightly
bruised.
it
may
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
mysterious
things,
that
later,
results
in
death
or
so
that
--
and
that
is
left
open
and
i
take
it
to
statute.
and
i
take
it.
i
can
argue.
i
can
read
the
statute
as
dealing
with
that
probability
that
you
wait
until
the
end
to
find
out
what
kind
of
punishment
should
be
imposed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
the
fate
of
the
victim
may
not
be
unambiguous
at
the
time
of
the
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
the
purpose
of
my
--
my
remark
is
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
third
string
amounts
to
--
the
third
string
amounts
to
saying
that
the
information
must
be
right
because
it
couldn't
be
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
go
to
different
statutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
would
have
to
read
the
statute
to
see
whether
the
punishment
provision
as
it
were
an
ingredient
of
the
offense
or
in
the
next
post
statute
determination
for
the
court
in
sentencing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
should
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
again
but
before
you
get
through
with
that
aspect
what
--
what
you
call
the
due
process.
i
hope
you
will
find
time
to
comment
on
my
view
one
doesn't
have
to
go
to
due
process
to
deal
with
the
problem.
if
one
found
in
propriety
they
use
that
including
term
in
the
fbi
man
seeing
the
judge
in
the
chambers,
ex-party
before
the
judge
knew
what
kind
of
plea
the
defendant
would
make.
that's
--
that's
part
of
our
supervisory
function
in
dealing
with
the
conduct
of
lower
courts
in
connection
with
the
rule
as
the
probation
officer,
one
doesn't
have
to
go
as
far
as
due
process
to
find
impropriety
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know?
how
do
we
know
and
the
whole
purport
of
the
federal
rule
is
that
he
shouldn't
be
influenced
by
knowledge
about
the
kind
of
a
federal
appeared
before
him
in
deciding
whether
to
accept
this
plea
of
guilty
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
because
we
have
assumed
that
judges
who
are
reversed
by
courts
of
appeals
are
sufficiently
disciplined
to
at
least
beyond
the
alert
in
regard
to
their
conduct
where
the
case
is
retried.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
part
which
is
a
very
important
element
from
my
point
of
view
in
considering
the
conduct
of
the
kind
of
man
who
ought
to
be
and
presumably
normally
are
under
federal
courts,
our
own
profession
and
particular
judge's
profession
train
them
in
that
kind
of
discipline.
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
a
judge
having
listened
to
a
report
that
evil
conduct
and
mischievousness
but
a
fellow
who
then
has
appearing
before
him
in
an
independent
role
in
deciding
what
to
do
with
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
so.
is
--
is
that
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
if
--
if
the
court
goes
with
you
that
the
information
--
some
information
couldn't
have
been
filed
here,
that
was
all
without
jurisdiction
under
the
rule
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
an
indictment
is
broad
and
you
follow
at
least
what
is
called
the
dictum
of
judge
hand
that
the
offense
was
charged
by
simply
saying
he
--
he
kidnapped
which
potentially
allowed
the
death
penalty,
the
government
wouldn't
be
as
estopped
from
now
proving
that
there
was
harm
or
--
so
that
i
don't
think
that
in
his
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
be
prosecuted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
may
not
be
able
to
get
a
death
sentence
but
non
consent
that
the
crime
has
evaporated
because
it
was
five
years
(inaudible)
