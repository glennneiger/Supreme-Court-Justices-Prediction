justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
same
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
win,
what
do
you
get?
what
happens?
what
--
what
is
the
contention
between
you,
you
just
get
a
new
trial,
is
that
all
you're
asking
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
you're
entitled
to
be
turned
--
he's
entitled
to
be
turned
loose
or
he's
entitled
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilt
and
have
a
new
trial?
which
do
you
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
position
here.
i
think
understand.
but
i'm
not
sure
i
can.
that
an
indictment
or
an
information
to
charge
with
capital
offense
but
show
not
merely
of
kidnapping
but
a
harming
of
the
kidnapped
person.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
if
you
mean
the
information
would
be
bad
as
it
alleged
there
because
it
would
show
that
it
was
a
capital
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
understand
you,
your
argument
is
that
or
your
position
is
that
if
it
does
not
judge
a
capital
offense,
unless
it
shows
all
the
ingredients
one
of
which
is
that
the
person
is
released,
no
person
was
harmed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
first
position
then
is
that
a
man
can
be
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
on
an
indictment
although
he's
not
charged
if
the
person
was
harmed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
please?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
the
policy
is
concerned,
do
you
think
anything
in
your
argument
that
would
make
it
wrong
for
the
government
to
have
the
information
of
this
(inaudible)
to
say
that
the
--
the
victim
was
released
unharmed
and
with
the
government
be
bound
by
that
if
it
said
it
that's
how
he'd
be
guilty
and
guilty
too
if
that's
what
was
said.
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
better
way
of
preserving
the
rights
of
the
party
that
you're
talking
on
the
present
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
my
untutored
mind,
i
can
think
of
nothing
better
than
charging
a
man
in
information
with
that
but
he's
charged
with
namely
kidnapping
somebody
and
turned
him
loose
without
harming
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unless
the
law
some
--
unless
there's
something
in
the
law
to
make
such
surpluses
to
such
an
extent
that
the
government
wouldn't
be
bound
by
the
limitations
of
its
charge
in
the
information.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
just
read
it.
it's
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it
be
enough
on
the
other
way
(inaudible)
to
allege
that
he
was
released
unharmed
to
--
to
his
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
would
be
another
fact
to
the
method
of
needing
here,
i
guess
i
should
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
didn't
allege
--
have
the
allegation
he's
harmed.
no,
but
it
wasn't
capital
and
if
it
did
say
he
were
harmed
say
it
was
a
capital.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
you
can
get
it
the
other
way.
and
when
you
value
information
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
it's
not
charged,
it's
not
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
if
i'll
be
taking
to
your
time
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this
question
to
get
my
--
your
view
on
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
that
your
first
position
is
that
this
should
be
left
open
for
it
to
be
determined
by
one
might
say
extrinsic
evidence
extrinsic.
it
doesn't
have
to
appear
in
the
indictment
or
information.
justice
hugo
l.
black
must
--
it
--
it's
left
up
in
the
air.
then
you
have
two
other
elements
as
i
see
it.
one
of
them
is
that
the
indictment
should
always
charge
it
on
the
information
so
you'd
know.
the
other
one
is
that
an
information
should
charge
that
the
--
it's
in
an
information
that
should
charge
if
it's
not
--
if
he
was
not
harmed,
when
he
was
released.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
the
practical
standpoint
of
the
government,
if
we
are
going
to
have
to
adopt
one
of
those
rules,
and
one
didn't
want
to
take
your
first
rule,
your
first
proposal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
are
the
other
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
if
that
is
to
be
it,
why
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
well,
if
there's
a
--
we
got
a
rule
generally,
just
to
say
that
when
it
doesn't,
information
should
say,
should
show
on
its
face
that
it's
not
capital
because
would
that
harm
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
that
the
information
on
its
face
should
show
that
the
man
was
released
unharmed.
what
injury
would
that
do
to
the
government
in
the
practical
affair
that's
enforcing
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
back
behind
except
this
man's
case
so
far
as
you
know
of,
it
would
do
the
government
any
injury
and
the
cases
that
have
been
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
how
many
cases
would
be
affected
by
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
line
of
authority.
i'm
talking
about
the
practical
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
some
kind
of
rule
that
if
we
have
the
document,
if
we
have
to
construe
it
then
in
connection
with
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

you're
wrong,
you're
not
--
i
don't
want
to
stop
you
here
you
can
go
right
on
but
i
would
like
to
(inaudible)
before
you
sit
down,
in
what
--
in
your
judgment
would
be
the
consequence
(voice

it
should
be
held
that
it
was
an
error
not
permit
him
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
the
first
question
i
asked
the
counsel
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
or
not
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
took
any
other.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
can
gather
from
him
that
he
was
asking
that
very
strongly
but
he
was
asking
what
would
happen
and
(voice

--
justice
hugo

what
provided
with
reference
to
amendments
to
information
