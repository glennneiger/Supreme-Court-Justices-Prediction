i
suppose,
mr.
davis,
bargaining
on
something
like
this
would
be
mandatory
under
the
obligation
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
national
labor
relations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
there
be
any
relevance
in
our
consideration
on
how
they
answer
this
question
that
sometimes,
perhaps
even
in
this
case,
provisions
of
this
kind
compromise
wage
demands.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
i
had
in
mind
was
and
i
write
sometimes
to
be
the
demand
of
x
cents
per
hour
increase
which
is
resolved
by
an
agreemen
to
this
kind
in
lieu
of
a
cents
per
hour
increase?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
though,
mr.
davis,
if
this
debt
isn't
paid
through
the
funds,
i
take
it
that
it
will
have
some
effect
perhaps
more,
but
some
effect,
will
it
not,
on
the
benefits
payable
or
to
the
affected
employee
and
are
eligible
to
see
those.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
now,
is
there
any
concept
of
payments
of
this
kind?
is
there
really
in
the
sense
of
preferred
wages?
justice

(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
kind
--
what
--
what
is
the
assignment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
do
you
suppose
if
this
came
within
--
in
this
instance,
wages
that
to
those
plans
that
some
employers
have
usually
not
for
workers
who
are
members
of
labor
organizations
but
for
executive
and
other
personnel
under
which
the
employer
voluntarily
supports
programs
of
this
kind
,
would
they
also
have
to
come
within
the
sweep
of
wages
for
the
--
in
the
event
the
employer
then
would
think
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
--
there,
and
those
instances
of
course
is
--
is
not
--
nothing
that
in
that
type
of
employer
ordinarily
that
involves
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
--
in
the
other
statues
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me,
mr.
markowitz.
i
think
i
am
correct,
am
i
not?
that
sometimes,
negotiations
of
this
kind
will
result
in
agreements
by
the
employer
to
provide
at
his
expense
only
group
insurance.
and
suppose
in
the
event
of
bankruptcy,
there's
--
owing
premiums
on
that
group
insurance
to
the
insurance
company.doesn't
your
reasoning
suggest
that
the
premiums
unpaid
then
constitute
wages
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
this
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
employers
who
provide
recreational
facilities
in
camps,
in
that
sort
of
thing
for
their
employees
that
the
employees
use
without
cost
to
themselves
but
the
expense
of
the
employer.
suppose
in
such
circumstances,
an
employer
goes
bankrupt
and
owes
the
butchers,
the
bakers,
the
coalman
and
all
the
others
who
have
serviced
that
facility.
do
the
claims
of
those
people
come
within
the
category
of
wages
for
the
purposes
of
fairness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
thinking

that

i'm
suggesting

do.
justice
william

brennan,

i'm
suggesting

that
the
employer
provides
them
in
lieu
of
higher
wages
than
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
this
is
the
part

paid
