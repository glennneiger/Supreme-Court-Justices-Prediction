mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
first
and
essential
consideration
and
problem
which
we
must
face
in
this
case
is
a
definition
of
the
term
“wages”
as
it
appears
to
the
bankruptcy
act.
congress
has
never
defined
this
term
in
this
bankruptcy
act
but
has
left
it
to
the
definition
of
courts
for
many
years.
and
courts
have
consistently,
beginning
back
in
1903,
defined
the
term
as
meaning
compensation
for
services
rendered,
reward
for
labor
performed.
and
this
is
the
meaning
which
is
attached
and
described
to
the
term
wages.
and
i
think
it's
critically
important
that
it
be
considered
in
this
fashion
in
the
context
of
this
case.
because,
the
term
wages,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
has
been
an
ambulatory
one.
it's
expanded
tremendously
as
are
industrial
economy
has
expanded.
then
there's
various
and
new
types
of
compensation
have
been
developed
in
the
field
of
collective
bargaining.
vacation
pay
,
severance
pays,
sick
leave
pay,
holiday
pay
and
numerous
kinds
of
fringe
benefits
all
exist
and
are
all
today
considered
by
our
court's
to
be
wages
for
the
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
it's
well
settled.
for
example,
as
vacation
pay
is
wages.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
it's
deferred
wages.
the
courts
have
said,
the
third
circuit
said
in
the
early
public
ledger
case.
and
i
think
that
concept
of
compensation
of
reward
for
labor
performed
is
one
which
is
inherit
in
the
definition
of
the
term
wages
as
it
appears
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
now,
how
does
that
relate
to
this
case?
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
no,
sir.
congress
has
accepted
benefits
such
as
hospitalization
benefits,
sickness
and
accident
benefits
which
are
received
from
disability
from
income
tax.
and
it's
gone
even
further
insofar
as
the
contributions
themselves
are
concerned
as
i'll
point
out
if
i
may
in
a
few
moments.
but
i
think
we
must
consider
how
this
contribution,
as
welfare
contribution
arises
here.
it
arises
from
the
product
of
collective
bargaining.
it's
due
to
the
welfare
fund
as
a
result
of
the
compensation
and
as
part
of
the
compensation
due
to
employees.
in
normal
situation,
an
employer
and
a
union
sit
down
to
negotiate
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
union
makes
numerous
demands.
the
employees
want
20
cents
an
hour
increase
and
they
want
a
welfare
fund
contribution
and
they
want
more
vacation
pay
and
they
want
additional
holidays.
and
as
the
parties
gradually
meet
and
counter
proposals
are
made
and
they
merge
toward
a
middle
ground
where
there's
going
to
be
a
meeting
in
their
minds.
the
employer
says
to
himself,
“i
have
so
much
money
to
spend
for
a
two-year
agreement.
i
can
afford
to
pay
20
cents
an
hour
for
labor
fees
for
two
years.”
and
he
in
effect,
says
to
the
union,
“you
do
what
--
what
you
want
with
this
amount.”
you
can
take
8
cents
in
wages
this
year
and
5
cents
next
year
and
somewhat
2
cents
which
will
cover
increase
vacation
cost
and
5
cents
to
a
welfare
fund
or
have
it
anyway
you
please
within
certain
limitations.
if
you
want
to
take
10
cents
this
year
and
5
cents
to
welfare
fund,
that's
up
to
you.”
but
the
union
and
the
employees
of
course
and
the
union
acting
as
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees
decide
that
they
want
so
much
money
in
welfare
fund
contribution.
if
they
want
5
cents
an
hour
or
in
this
case
$2
a
week
or
$8
a
month
to
go
to
the
welfare
fund,
and
this
is
a
part
of
their
compensation.
this
is
the
part
of
the
reward
for
the
labor
that
they
performed.
just
as
if
they
put
this
5
cents
an
hour
in
their
pocket
as
part
of
their
wages,
is
added
to
their
hourly
rate
of
pay.
so
they
take
5
cents
and
had
--
and
asked
the
employer
to
give
it
directly
to
the
welfare
fund
as
part
of
the
compensation
for
the
labor
that
they
performed.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
statute
uses
the
term
wages,
sir.
and
wages
is
defined
as
compensation
due
to
employees
for
labor
performed.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes,
sir.
it
does.
and
i
--
i
would
go
further
and
point
out
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
fact
that
the
government's
position
does
not
withstand
logical
analysis.
because
suppose
we
take
this
5
cents
per
hour
that
the
employer
and
the
union
have
negotiated
to
be
contributed
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
the
government
says,
“when
you
take
this
5
cents
per
hour,
you
pay
it
directly
to
the
welfare
fund.
it's
not
wages,
it's
not
entitled
the
priority.”
but
suppose
that
the
5
cents
per
hour
were
paid
directly
to
the
employee
who
then
signed
an
authorization
and
said,
“please
pay
5
cents
per
hour
to
the
welfare
fund
or
to
the
insurance
company
or
whatever
the
direction
in
order
to
obtain
the
same
benefits.”
now,
the
government
says
in
the
--
the
ross
case
in
california
and
the
second
circuit
case
which
the
government
supports
all
say
that
this
is
entitled
a
priority,
this
is
wages.
and
the
analogy
goes
even
further
because
in
this
case,
we
have
a
--
a
direct
proof,
the
record
shows,
that
this
welfare
fund
contribution
is
a
direct
substitute
for
sick
leave
which
is
direct
payment
to
employees.
the
employees
at
these
establishments
enjoy
seven
days
sick
leave
per
year
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
page
--
on
page
29
points
out
that
the
article
as
to
welfare
plan
shall
be
operative
only
in
the
event
that
--
or
because
of
the
fact
that
the
sick
leave
provisions
have
been
given
up.
so
the
employ
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
the
employees
have
given
up
their
right
to
receive
sick
leave
directly
in
return
for
the
employer
contribution
to
the
welfare
fund.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes,
sir,
directly.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
and
it's
done
consistently
by
employers
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes,
sir.
and
--
and
that's
their
right
to
--
to
desire
that
amount
in
terms
of
a
fringe
benefit.
now,
suppose
the
employer
went
bankrupt
and
did
not
pay
the
holiday
pay.
i
think
that
clearly,
there'd
be
no
question
for
--
to
that
holiday
pay.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well
they
have
a
right
to
ask
that
just
as
they
ask
for
more
vacation.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
the
employer
does
pay,
sir
because
it's
a
paid
holiday.
when
you
talk
about
holidays
under
a
collective
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
--
the
employer
pays.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
--
i
don't
know
of
any
such
holidays
--
[laughs]
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
--
that
are
not
paid,
sir
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
while
you
--
that
that
maybe
where
the
sick
leave.
i
dont
know
that
--
that
example
exist
in
--
in
collective
bargaining
relationships,
sir.
when
--
you
have
holidays,
they
are
paid
for
by
the
employer
and
represent
a
cost
to
the
employer.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes,
sir.
where
--
which
would
increase
the
hourly
rate
that
which
they'd
take
home.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
oh,
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
decreased
working
hours
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
--
can't
be
compensated
except
in
the
increase
in
the
hourly
rate
to
the
employer
for
the
time
which
is
worth,
assuming
the
same
take
home
pay
is
involved.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
there's
no
compensation
i
suppose
that
can
be
given
for
a
holiday
which
is
not
paid
for.
but
then
actually,
it's
--
it's
not
paid
for
so
there's
no
pay
involved
in
it.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
benefit
sir
if
there's
no
pay.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
but
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
it
seems
to
me,
they
are
normal
business
claims
and
as
a
general
--
their
--
their
debtor-creditor
relationships.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
they're
not
--
they're
not
--
they
don't
arise
out
of
the
employer-employee
relationships.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
there's
no
relation
to
compensation
for
services
rendered.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
yes.
but
--
but
they
aren't
--
it
--
it
is
true
that
they
maybe
or
i
--
i
think
i
misunderstood
your
question
for
which
--
i
am
sorry.
it
is
true
certainly
that
the
employer
provides
them
that
their
part
in
a
sense
of
compensation,
although
that
--
although
they
don't
--
there's
no
direct
benefit
to
the
employee
derived
from
this
form
of
compensation
so
to
speak.
they're
--
they're
more
or
less
of
an
attribute,
more
than
--
more
perhaps
in
the
form
of
compensation,
i
think.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
that's
a
form
of
compensation,
certainly.
and
--
and
it's
computed
actually
for
income
tax
purposes,
particulary
in
the
restaurant
industry,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
the
--
if
the
employee,
he
also
cater
--
i
suspect
not,
because
that's
not
--
that's
not
part
of
the
compensation
of
the
employee.
if
the
employee
has
already
eaten
a
lunch,
he's
gotten
a
compensation.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
now
(inaudible)
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
i
just
--
there's
no
question
but
that
compensation
may
achieve
many
forms
and
can
perhaps
be
expanded.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
where
the
bankruptcy
act
talks
about
wages
due
to
workmen
and
that
with
the
term
wages,
while
certainly
it
means
compensation.
i
think
it
means
in
terms
of
employer
cost
for
labor
performed.
now,
the
internal
revenue
code
which
mr.
davis
mentioned
and
a
number
of
other
taxing
statutes
all
specifically
accept
wages
from
the
definition
of
income.
and
we
contend
that
this
doesn't
show
that
these
contributions
are
not
--
weigh
also
specifically
accept
--
excuse
me
--
welfare
fund
contributions
from
the
definition
of
income.
so
that
an
employee
is
not
taxed
for
the
benefit
that
he
receives
by
virtue
of
the
employer
contribution
to
the
welfare
fund.
now,
this
shows
it
seems
to
us,
number
one,
a
recognition
by
congress
that
where
the
exception
not
made,
this
welfare
fund
contributions
would
be
income,
would
be
wages
to
the
employee.
but
the
need
for
a
specific
exception
from
the
definition
of
income
shows
that
--
shows
the
congressional
recognition
of
the
fact
that
otherwise,
they
would
be
interpreted
to
be
wages.
and
in
fact,
the
--
the
congressional
purpose
of
benefiting
welfare
funds
by
encouraging
contributions
is
to
be
found
in
this
exception
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
social
security
act
nor
the
other
taxing
statutes.
and
if
we
take
this
5
cents
which
i
mentioned
before
and
pay
it
directly
to
the
employee
and
have
him
assign
it
to
the
welfare
fund
or
have
it
--
have
him
assign
it
to
the
insurance
company
or
to
the
welfare
fund
where
the
government
says,
“this
is
entitled
a
priority,”
he
there
has
to
pay
taxes
on
that
money
because
it's
paid
to
him.
but
if
it's
paid
directly
by
the
employer
to
the
welfare
fund
there
is
no
tax
on
it.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well,
by
analogy
perhaps
except
in
the
recent
welfare
fund
and
pension
fund
disclosure
act
which
was
passed
and
approved
last
august,
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
shows
without
a
doubt
that
congress
recognized
that
welfare
fund
contributions
are
part
of
the
compensation
to
employees
that
they
are
part
of
the
wages
which
employees
earned.
and
they're
earned
by
employees
by
virtue
of
their
labor.
now,
i
cited
the
--
the
senate
committee
reports
in
our
brief
and
there's
no
sense
repeating
them
here.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
carter
case
which
we
think
is
most
important
and
in
which
we
think
the
analysis
and
the
rationale
of
the
court
clearly
points
the
way
to
defining
these
welfare
fund
contributions
as
wages.
in
the
carter
case,
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
obligating
the
employer
to
make
a
welfare
fund
contribution.
and
the
miller
act
under
which
that
case
arose
provided
that
a
contractor
who
engages
in
construction
work
for
the
government
must
file
a
bond
guaranteeing
to
labor
and
material
men,
all
sums
justly
due
to
them.
now,
the
employer
did
not
make
his
welfare
fund
contributions
and
the
trustees
of
the
welfare
fund
brought
suit
against
the
bonding
company,
against
the
surety,
saying
that
you're
responsible
for
this
welfare
fund
contributions.
and
the
bonding
company
defended
on
the
ground
that
these
aren't
sums
justly
to
the
employees
who
performed
the
work.
and
the
both
--
this
court
reversed
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
said
that
the
trustees
in
the
welfare
fund
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
employees
who
performed
labor
to
receive
these
contributions.
and
the
trustees
to
the
welfare
fund
have
the
right
to
collect
these
benefits
because
they
are
in
a
sense,
although
perhaps
not
the
formal
or
technical
assignees
to
the
employees,
they
are
--
they
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
--
the
exact
phrased
used.
and
they
--
the
-
-the
trustees,
the
welfare
fund
have
as
much
right
to
receive
these
benefits
as
the
employees
did
to
receive
their
wages
in
cash.
now,
i
believe
that
contrary
to
the
government's
position,
the
original
purpose
of
the
wage
priority
is
fulfilled
by
granting
a
priority
to
these
welfare
fund
contriubutions
because
the
very
purpose
of
these
contributions
is
to
give
protection
to
the
employee
against
illness,
accident,
hospitalization,
not
only
of
himself
but
also
of
his
family
in
a
time
when
he
most
needs
it.
because
certainly,
when
illness
strikes
at
times
--
at
time
of
unemployment,
that
certainly
is
when
the
benefit
is
most
needed
and
there
is
a
direct
benefit
to
the
employee,
because
of
the
contribution.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
record
gives
any
indication,
sir,
of
that
fact.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
this
covers
just
the
restaurants
in
philadelphia.
it
does
not
cover
the
bellevue
stratford
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
pardon?
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
yes,
sir,
there
are.
mr.
richard
h.
markowitz
well
there's
no
question
about
it
because
the
eligibility
rules
of
the
welfare
fund
may
--
may
make
the
determination
in
the
receipt
of
benefits
dependent
upon
the
receipt
of
contributions
for
so
many
hours
of
employment.
and
if
those
contributions
aren't
received,
an
employee
may
not
be
eligible
to
receive
benefits
unless
if
they
aren't
granted
a
priority,
he
may
not
be
entitled
to
the
funds
which
the
welfare
fund
would
pay
him
in
case
of
accident,
illness,
hospitalization
and
so
on.
and
--
and
this
court
recognized
that
fact
in
the
carter
case
where
in
a
footnote
it's
pointed
out,
that
eligibility
may
depend
upon
receipt
of
contributions
for
certain
number
of
hours
work.
so
that
essentially
and
basically,
the
position
of
the
welfare
funds
here
is
that
the
contributions
are
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
package.
they're
part
of
the
wage
picture.
they
can't
be
divorced
from
the
labor
rendered
in
the
services
performed
by
employees,
and
they
are
just
as
much
wages
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act
as
vacation
pay
or
as
the
money
actually
received
in
the
pocket
of
the
employee
pursuant
to
his
daily
rate.
thank
you.
