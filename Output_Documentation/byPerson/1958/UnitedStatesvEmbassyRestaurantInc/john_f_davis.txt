mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
sum
of
money
owed
by
a
bankrupt
restaurant
to
the
trustees
of
a
union
welfare
fund,
whether
these
sums
of
money
are
wages
due
to
workmen
within
the
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
act
so
that
they
will
be
entitled
to
a
priority
of
payment.
if
these
sums
due
to
the
welfare
fund
are
to
be
considered
as
wages
due
to
workmen,
then
they
are
entitled
to
a
priority
to
be
paid
immediately
after
the
expenses
of
administering
the
estate.
if
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
wages,
then
they
will
share
with
the
other
secured
creditors.
now,
the
embassy
restaurant
in
philadelphia
had
contracted
to
pay
to
the
trustees
of
the
welfare
plans
for
the
local
unions,
which
represented
their
chefs,
theirs
cooks
and
the
local
union
representing
the
waiters
and
waitresses,
the
sum
of
$8
a
month
for
each
union
employee.
this
obligation
arose
from
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
had
been
entered
into
between
the
greater
philadelphia
restaurant
operators,
inc.,
representing
the
restaurants
generally,
and
the
local
joint
executive
board
of
philadelphia
which
was
made
up
of
the
unions
of
the
workers
who
worked
in
the
restaurants
and
the
hotels.
and
the
purpose
of
these
--
the
purpose
of
these
payments
and
it's
set
forth,
page
30
of
the
record,
and
this
is
quoted
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
under
(b)
and
this
is
all
what
is
stated
about
the
purpose.
“these
funds
shall
be
maintained
and
utilized
to
promote
life
insurance,
weekly
sick
benefits,
hospital
and
surgical
benefits
and
other
benefits
for
the
employees
who
are
members
of
locals,”
and
it
names
them,
“in
the
employee
of
the
employer
as
in
that
practice.”
now,
the
funds
were
to
be
operated
--
were
to
be
used
in
accordance
with
a
trust
agreement
which
is
also
set
forth
in
the
record
at
pages
9
to
--
9
to
24.
the
restaurants
are
not
a
direct
party
to
these
trust
agreements.
the
trust
agreement
entered
into
by
the
local
union,
in
this
case,
the
chefs
and
cooks
union,
and
the
board
of
trustees
for
the
welfare
fund.
and
this
is
the
document
under
which
the
recipients
of
these
payments
from
the
--
from
the
restaurant
were
to
be
governed
in
--
in
the
administration
of
their
trust.
this,
too,
is
stated
in
the
most
general
terms.
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
provision
on
page
11,
which
names
the
purpose
of
the
trust
and
to
article
ii,
section
2.
it
says,
“the
purposes
of
the
chefs,
cooks,
pastry
cooks
and
assistants'
local
union
--
local
111
welfare
plan
shall
be
provide
welfare
benefits
for
employee
who
use
--
who
meet
the
eligibility
requirements
for
coverage
as
such
eligible
--
eligibility
requirements
presently
exist
or
are
amended.
almost
a
cut
blank
but
they
don't
define
welfare
benefits
other
than
just
welfare
benefits
as
such.and
then,
in
the
duties
of
the
trustees,
the
trustees
are
given
authority
to
determine
how
these
funds
shall
be
used.”
and
article
iv
on
page
13
states
--
gives
these
trustees
the
--
the
authority
to
make
the
determination
as
to
what
welfare
purposes
they
shall
be
used
for.
it's
one
of
the
item
in
the
--
in
the
trust
agreement
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
rights,
the
beneficial
rights
of
the
union
members.
on
page
22,
this
was
specifically
stated,
“the
money
is
to
be
paid
in
the
said
local
111
welfare
plan
shall
not
constitute
or
be
deemed
moneys
due
to
the
individual
employees.
mr.
john
f.
davis
page
22
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
black.
now
these,
i
think,
are
--
are
all
the
facts
which
we
have
before
us
in
--
in
this
case.
and
the
question
which
we
have
to
answer
is
whether
this
$8
per
employee,
which
was
not
paid,
is
to
be
considered
wages
within
the
provisions
of
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
language
of
that
section
is
not
helpful.
it
merely
says
that
there
shall
be
a
priority
for
wages
due
to
workmen.
legislative
history
of
that
section
is
also,
as
far
as
any
reference
to
congressional
debates
or
reports,
is
also
not
helpful.
the
words
have
been
in
the
statute
in
these
words
since
about
1841,
although
there
have
been
some
changes
in
the
details.
but
as
far
as
interpretation
goes,
it's
always
just
referred
to
wages
to
employees.
so
far
as
judicial
interpretations
of
this
section
are
concerned,
there
is
a
split
between
the
second
circuit
which
in
a
case
named
local
140
against
hack
in
242
f.2d,
decided
that
these
funds
were
not
wages
on
facts
which
are
very
close
to
this
case.
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
--
in
this
very
case
which
recognize
the
conflict
and
came
to
the
office
with
result.
there
are
several
district
court
opinions
in
new
york,
in
new
jersey
and
in
southern
california.
new
york
and
new
jersey
going
one
way,
california
the
other,
and
these
opinions
are
divided
on
it.
i
find
them
unusually
--
unusually
helpful
in
--
in
analyzing
the
question,
they're
good
opinions
and
they
raised
the
issues
very
close
--
very,
very
carefully.
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
the
closest
that
this
court
has
come
to
this
question,
i
think,
is
in
united
states
against
carter
in
353
u.s.
210.
you
did
not
have
before
you
at
that
time
priorities
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
you
had
a
question
as
to
whether
a
bond
given
to
secure
a
payment
in
connection
with
construction
of
federal
buildings,
a
bond
which
secured
amounts
justly
to
the
persons
for
labor,
would
include
an
obligation
to
pay
funds
to
a
welfare
plan.
and
the
court
in
deciding
that
the
bond
did
cover
those
payments,
was
specific
in
saying
that
it
covered
more
than
wages.
and
that
even
though
these
particular
payments
were
designated
as
not
being
wages,
they
were
still
covered
by
the
bond.
so
that
the
case,
insofar
as
it
has
any
application,
is
not
--
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
position
which
we
take
here.
i
think
that
it
is
note
--
noteworthy
that
in
other
statutes,
however,
payments
to
welfare
funds
are
generally
not
treated
as
wages.
thus,
they
are
not
taxable
to
the
employee
under
the
income
tax
law.
they're
not
taxable
to
the
employee
under
the
social
security
taxes.
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
payments
made
to
welfare
funds
are
not
considered
to
be
part
of
the
regular
wages
which
would
be
doubled
for
over
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
these
--
these
are
statutory
provisions,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'd
say
under
the
statute,
under
--
for
example,
the
income
tax
law
under
the
20
--
under
the
revenue
code,
26
u.s.c.
106.
it
specifically
provided
that
these
shall
not
be
taxable
to
the
employee.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
doesn't
contain
the
provision,
but
it
has
been
interpreted
that
these
are
not
the
standard
wages,
the
--
the
administrator
has
--
has
so
interpreted
it.
there's
--
as
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
judicial
decision
on
that
but
it's
--
that's
the
way
it's
been
administered
throughout.
i
mean
similarly,
under
the
walsh-healey
act,
it's
been
administered
by
the
department
of
labor
where
there
is
a
provision
for
the
payment
of
prevailing
minimum
wages.
that
too
has
been
always
interpreted
as
not
including
welfare
benefits
within
the
term
prevailing
wages.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
that
is
so,
but
on
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
right.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
its
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
is
clear
that
it
would
be
mandatory.
there
are
several
cases
holding
that
this
does
fall
within
the
fair
labor
--
the
nlrb
as
a
--
as
a
subject
which
they
must
bargain
on.
but
i
may
call
your
attention
there
that
it's
not
that
--
it's
not
necessarily
because
they
are
wages,
because
the
cases
themselves
speak
not
only
of
wages
but
other
conditions
of
employment,
so
that
--
and
the
case
has
--
in
discussing
whether
this
is
a
subject
which
must
be
bargained
upon,
say
most
of
them
say
this
is
wages
or
it
is
other
conditions
of
--
of
employment,
so
it
must
be
--
they
must
bargain
on
it.
there
is
a
first
circuit
--
first
circuit
case,
however,
which
just
says
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
nlrb,
it
is
wages.
it
leaves
out
the
second
--
the
second
circuit.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes.
i
think
it
has
some
pertinency,
but
i
think
that
you
should
have
this
in
mind
that
many
things
are
bargained
for.
this
--
this
particular
welfare
plan
was
a
subject
as
i
--
as
i
pointed
out
of
a
collective
bargain
--
bargaining
agreement.
many
things
are
bargained
for
and
are
required
to
be
bargained
for
which
are
not
wages.
and
even
if
it
may
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
amount
of
wages.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
in
many
times,
the
fringe
benefits
are
taken
into
consideration
in
how
much
--
how
much
they
will
be
given
in
--
in
the
direct
wages.
now,
that
--
i'm
not
sure
if
that
that
helps
us
in
the
statute.
it
shows
that
they
are
aligned,
they
have
some
relation
to
wages,
but
whether
they
are
part
of
wages
or
instead
of
wages,
i
don't
know.
it's
almost
a
question
of
semantics
whether
you
say
that
they
are
part
of
the
wages
or
instead
of
wages.
you
don't
have
to
give
as
much
wages
because
you
give
other
benefits.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it's
been
interpreted,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
by
regulation,
i
think
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
it's
been
the
consistent
interpretation
of
both
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
would
make
larger
--
higher
wages.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
more
over
time
or
higher
percentage
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
now,
i
think
that
the
basic
purpose
of
this
provision
for
priority
is
--
is
quite
clear.
it
was
clearly
intended
to
recompense
in
cash,
employees
who
were
thrown
out
of
work
by
reason
of
the
bankruptcy
of
their
employers
and
who
had
money
due
from
the
employers.
and
the
idea
was
that
these
people
were
entitled
to
something
more
than
--
than
other
creditors.
they
were
not
in
as
good
a
bargaining
position
perhaps
and
any
way,
they
should
get
taxed.
now,
to
give
this
kind
of
priority
for
a
welfare
fund,
and
to
give
this
kind
of
a
debt
for
a
welfare
fund,
that
priority
probably
fulfills
that
--
that
purpose.
the
workers
cannot
buy
bread
with
a
priority
given
them
for
a
welfare
fund.
i
think
that
if
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
--
i
think
we
must
assume
that
it
will
be
a
detriment
to
these
--
to
these
employees
if
they
will
have
less
protection
from
the
welfare
fund.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
are
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
with
pensions.
there
are
with
pensions,
but
not
with
respect
to
this
--
not
with
--
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
welfare
payment
of
such
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
actually
--
welfare
plans
and
this
is
pretty
much
the
standard
--
in
some
respects,
the
standard
plan,
is
for
group
life
insurance,
sick
benefits,
hospitalization,
surgery
benefits,
and
sometimes
insurance
to
pay
them
while
they're
out
of
work,
while
they're
sick.
i
mean,
that
--
that
sickness
insurance,
that
kind
of
disability
insurance.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
generally
covered
by
these
welfare
plans
and
which
seems
to
be
contemplated
in
this
contract.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
true.
it
included
the
--
well,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
overstate
that.
it
included
the
members
in
the
philadelphia
area
of
these
locals.
it
wasn't
a
national
welfare
plan
in
the
sense
of
the
--
of
the
--
john
l.
lewis
has
called
welfare
plan.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
--
it
was
--
there
were
--
the
--
the
employees
of
the
bellevue
stratford
and
--
and
book
binders,
had
just
as
much
interest
in
these
payments
by
the
embassy
restaurant,
as
the
pastry
cook
and
the
onion
peeler
in
--
in
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
in
the
embassy
restaurant
itself.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
this
would
give
the
same
benefit
to
the
other
members
of
the
union
who
would
have
an
interest
in
the
plan
that
it
would
to
the
particular
employees
who
are
threw
--
thrown
out
of
work--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
union,
too,
are
included
in
this.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
employees
of
the
union,
but
that
is
another
feature
of
this
plan
that
it
includes
not
only
employees
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
are
included,
yes.
the
employees
of
the
other
restaurants
and
the
employees
of
the
union.
the
terms
of
the
trust
in
defining
employees
on
page
10
of
the
record,
show
that
the
employee
shall
include
employees
employed
by
the
union
who
don't
work
for
any
restaurant.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
two
ways
that
we
have
to
approach
the
--
this
interpretation.
one
is
by
the
rather
painstaking
way
of
looking
at
the
attributes
of
these
payments
and
the
attributes
of
wages.
these
are
paid
not
measured
by
the
labor
of
the
individual
but
paid
by
the
person.
they're
not
paid
to
these
individuals,
they're
paid
to
somebody
else,
someone
else.
we
look
at
these
attributes
and
put
them
against
wages
and
say,
“do
we
think
these
look
like
wages?”
now,
that's
what
i
say
is
a
narrow
thought
of
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
on
the
other
hand,
you
say
that
they
are
bargained.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
say
that
they're
bargained
for
and
they
take
the
place
of
wages
and
that
way
is
on
the
other
side.
now,
there
is
the
broader
way
of
looking
at
this
thing
and
that
is.
i
think
whether
--
and
this
i
think
is
--
is
the
--
the
type
of
interpretation
this
court
often
looks
at
and
that
is
what
is
the
--
what
is
congress
really
getting
at
in
this
kind
of
thing
is
it
--
does
congress
want
to
favor
these
welfare
plans?
does
congress
want
to
--
want
this
court
to
give
its
broader
construction
to
wages
as
possible
because
congress
is
in
favor
of
welfare
plans.
and
it's
argued
in
some
of
the
cases
below
and
--
and
the
respondent
argues
that
there
is
a
congressional
policy
that
favors
these
so
that
we
should
--
in
order
to
achieve
that
policy
in
this
setting,
we
should
give
wages
a
broad
interpretation.
well,
i
think
that's
a
--
that's
the
appropriate
thing
to
inquire
into,
but
i
believe
that
if
you
have
--
one
look
at
what
the
congressional
position
is
on
welfare
plans
that
you
will
not
find
that
there
is
a
general
policy
to
favor
the
union
welfare
plans
as
such.
good
welfare
plans,
yes,
bad
welfare
plans,
no.
and
congress,
in
--
in
legislating
in
this
field
has
been
selective.
it
has
encouraged
some
and
it
has
discouraged
others.
the
taft-hartley
act
,
for
example,
in
providing
for
employer
contributions
makes
it
illegal
to
contribute
--
for
an
employer
to
contribute
to
an
employee
welfare
plan,
unless
there's
joint
control
of
that
plan
by
the
employer
and
the
employee.
unless
the
funds
are
used
exclusively
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
and
unless
there
is
an
audit,
i
think
it's
an
annual
audit
of
the
plan
which
is
made
available
to
the
employees.
if
--
unless
a
plan
meets
those
conditions
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
plan.
this
is
what
i
mean
by
saying
that
congress
picks
and
chooses
among
the
plans
to
decide
which
plans
it
believes
are
beneficent
and
which
are
bad.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
right.
it
--
it
puts
that
regulation
on
it.
it
--
may
i
say
this
plan
would
not
fit
--
would
not
fill
that
fill
at
all.
this
--
on
this
plan,
if
this
--
if
this
company
were
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
taft-hartley
act,
this
--
this
would
be
an
unfair
practice
for
the
employer
to
make
a
contribution
in
this
case.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
congress
hasn't
put
a
blessing
on
welfare
plans
as
such.
it
has
put
a
blessing
on
welfare
plans
which
work
for
the
welfare
of
--
of
the
employees.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
think
this
court
should
probably
--
what
i'm
suggesting
really
is
that
you
should
leave
to
the
court,
leave
to
the
--
leave
to
congress
a
determination
as
to
whether
it
wants
to
include
this
as
one
of
the
benefits
to
be
given
to
welfare
plans
or
whether
--
if
it
does
want
to
give
it
to
them,
it
wants
to
be
selective.
there
was
a
bill
introduced
at
last
--
the
last
session
of
--
of
congress.
it
didn't
pass,
but
congressman
cellar
introduced
it.
and
i
--
i
understand
it
was
introduced
with
the
--
with
the
approval
of
the
ci
--
of
the
afl-cio.
and
this
bill
would
have
granted
a
priority
to
employee
welfare
plans.
but
it
also
provided
that
it
would
it
would
grant
the
priority
only
to
welfare
plans
where
the
contributions
were
made
proportionate
to
the
hours
of
labor
of
wages
paid
for
the
employee.
and
where
the
welfare
plan
would
be
a
--
recognized
as
a
proper
one
for
a
deduction
by
the
employer
in
the
income
tax
plot.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that's
right.
now,
i
do
not
think
that
is
an
inappropriate
judicial
process
to
--
there's
a
possible
one
to
look
at
each
one
of
these
plans
and
say,
“there's
enough
of
the
benefit
that
these
go
to
the
employees
so
that
we
should
call
this
wages.”
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
a
difficult
one.
and
therefore
i
suggest
that
what
should
happen
is
that
it
should
be
left
to
congress.
now,
there's
just
one
--
one
other
feature
on
this
question
of
the
policy
of
--
of
aiding
a
labor
in
this
case.
to
give
a
priority
in
this
case,
undoubtedly
in
one
sense
is
a
--
is
a
help
to
labor.
and
another
sense
however,
it
tucks
into
a
right
which
is
already
given.
under
the
present
priority
statutes,
employees
are
limited
to
$600
a
piece
in
the
priority
which
they
would
receive.
if
this
is
to
be
considered
as
part
of
their
wages,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
result
in
cutting
that
much
into
the
direct
benefits
and
--
and
siphoning
it
into
the
--
into
the
welfare
payments.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
they
would
be
even
closer
--
even
more
closely
wages
than
this,
your
honor,
because
they
would
be
cases
where
at
least
the
benefits
would
be
going
specifically
to
employees
of
this
--
of
this
employer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
--
if
the
court
please.
i
made
a
mistatement
in
my
reply
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
with
respect
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
provides
that
this
type
of
payment
shall
not
be
considered
in
the
regular
wage.
it
makes
a
specific
statutory
provision
to
that
effect
rather
than
it
being
a
matter
of
interpretation
and
regulation.
and
the
citation
of
that
is
41
u.s.c.
section
35.
i
made
a
--
a
list
of
the
kind
of
benefits
which
employers
give
sometimes
which
are
growing
up
today
in
which
have
more
or
less
comparable
to
what
we
have
here.
and
it
--
i
think
it's
the
--
it
shows
what
kind
of
things
we're
getting
into
if
we
consider
all
this
kind
of
thing
wages.
in
this
particular
case,
they
bargained
for
one
free
meal
a
day.
when
they
--
when
they
were
an
employee
in
the
restaurant
with
a
specific
provision
that
this
would
not
be
taxable
to
the
employee
as
income.
they
bargained
for
locker
space
in
this
particular
thing
and
frequently,
they
are
these
provisions
with
respect
to
--
to
working
conditions.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
of
course.
the
--
but
when
you
come
to
considering
whether
or
not
these
things
are
wages
not
in
this
sense
but
in
the
general
sense
of
wages
for
the
fair
labors
standards
act,
for
the
other
purposes.
they're
not
generally
treated
as
wages,
they
are
fringed
benefits.
they
go
beyond
what
is
ordinarily
wages.
we
don't
--
i
don't
think
we
really
have
any
question
of
the
priority
under
the
bankruptcy
act
with
respect
to
these
things.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
think
it
has
received
that
gloss.
i
think
that
he
uses
compensation,
really
to
mean
the
benefits
by
which
an
employee
--
employees
bargain.
and
in
a
sense,
that
is
a
compensation
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
necessarily
the
same
as
wages,
that's
really
the
question
which
is
before
us.
now,
just
one
other
thing,
if
the
court
is
interested
in
what
the
nature
of
this
type
of
plan
is.
what
the
benefits
are,
the
united
states
department
of
labor
bureau
of
labor
statistics
has
put
out
a
bulletin,
bulletin
number
1221
which
i
don't
think
is
cited
in
any
of
our
--
in
our
briefs
which
gives
a
description
of
the
type
of
insurance
plans
which
are
covered
in
these
collective
bargaining
agreements.
i
can
leave
this
copy
of
it
with
the
--
with
the
clerk
or
the
marshall
if
it
would
be
helpful.
mr.
john
f.
davis
1221
--
1221,
bulletin
number
1221.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
thank
you.
