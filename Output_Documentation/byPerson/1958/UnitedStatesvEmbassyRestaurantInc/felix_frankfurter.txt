would
you
say
that
abolishing
the
act,
has
been
interpreted
or
specifically
deals
with
these
problems?
justice
felix
frankfurter
interpreted.
and
you
also
said
the
federal
--
the
fair
labor
standards
act
has
been
interpreted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
both
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
was
by
regulation.
and
for
some
--
for
some
duration,
both
interpretation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
both
interpretations
are
as
it
weren't
--
both
interpretations
implicitly
are
not
taking
what
might
be
called
the
literal
or
latitude
(inaudible)
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
well,
i
mean
if
--
or
just
as
a
fact.
if
--
if
these
were
included
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
make
higher
wages.
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
so
far
as
any
general
talk
about
things
should
be
construed
infavorably.
those
two
practical
illustrations
go
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you,
perhaps
two
general
questions?
i
was
wondering
how
is
the
court
to
decide
this
case,
this
kind
of
a
case.
on
the
one
hand,
you
can't
say
as
--
you
can't
say
this
is
an
old
statute.
the
term
wages
comes
down
from
100
years
and
nobody
thought
about
wages
to
include
these
fringe
benefits
in
1841
or
whatever
it
was.
that's
no
good
because
the
term
in
the
statute
is
ambulatory
and
--
and
creates
to
itself
whatever
new
menu
may
properly
be
applied
with.
that's
--
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
one
can
say,
“well,
this
ought
to
be
what
is
called
liberally
construed,”
and
you
bring
forth
other
cognate
statutes,
which
in
practice
could
have
been
construed
to
include
this
(inaudible),
but
that's
on
the
other
side.
then
also,
that
is
the
preference
for
me,
very
strong
consideration,
an
element
that
this
priority
statute
has
been
construed
certainly
by
this
court
to
make
1%
out
of
shylock.
on
the
whole,
that
statute
has
been
very
strictly
and
closely
construed
to
--
to
give
uncle
sam,
if
i
may
use
the
colloquialism,
every
break.
i
am
in
that
--
in
that
odd
mixture
of
consideration,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
resolve
those
conflicting
considerations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
tell
me
that,
i
know
how
to
answer
your
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand,
other
consideration
of
justice
brennan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
wages,
that's
the
form
of
wages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
even
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
we
might
make
a
distinction?
do
you
think
that
would
or
would
not
be
unfair
labor
practices?
do
this
court
grantins
priorities
that
promote
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
are
the
considerations,
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
illumin
that
--
that
judge
hallanan
set
forth
in
his
opinion
in
the
district
court.
and
you've
quoted
on
page
24
and
25
of
your
brief.
says,
if
this
is
to
be
done,
then
it
can't
be
the
one
way
or
the
other,
there
might
be
all
sorts
of
qualifying
to
that
duration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
impossible
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
may
i
ask
you
this
point?
would
any
that
i'm
concerned.
then
it
was
out
of
business
plans,
be
included
in
the
income
tax
of
the
employee's
annual
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
(inaudible)
would
be
logical,
can
be
logical
in
the
sense
that
abrstractly
logical.
take
--
take
the
reason
settlement
and
deliver
a
man
in
new
york,
they
wanted
to
have
some
extra
holiday
instead
of
extra
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can
you
translate
the
value
of
those
extra
holidays
in
dollars
and
cents
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
just
want
to
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
mean,
but
--
if
it
is
done
if
they
figure
it
out,
but
they
say,
“we
just
want
columbus
day
and
kosciusko
day
and
so
on.”
and
that's
translated
into
dollars
and
cents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
if
he
--
if
he
assured
it
is
to
be
paid.
if
you
--
if
he
goes
bankcrupt
and
then
he
owes
them
for
--
that's
not
--
that's
true.
but
suppose
it's
just
a
holiday
of
his
own,
they
want
more
holidays.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
would
it
then
translate
the
value
of
that
holiday
for
which
the
employer
doesn't
pay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
knew
some
holidays
that
are
not
paid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
want
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
want
--
they
want
to
be
free
on
certain
days.
you
can
take
some
holidays
from
the
government
and
not
be
paid
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
benefit
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
men
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest,
it
merely
showed
the
congress
in
the
great
enactments
have
addressed
itself
directly
to
that
question,
and
you're
trying
to
prove
it
here
argumentatively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
--
the
sole
argument
is
that
wages
must
be
read
to
equal
compensation
in
the
priority
statute.
and
substitue
strike
out
wages,
according
to
the
first
compensation
because
wages
has
now
had
--
has
received
a
judicial
gloss.
that's
what
wages
mean.
