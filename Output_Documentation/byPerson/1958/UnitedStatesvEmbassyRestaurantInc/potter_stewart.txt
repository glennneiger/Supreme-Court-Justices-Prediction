and
of
course,
the

the
beneficiaries
of

included
not
only
the

the
employees
of

many,
many
other
people,
isn't
that
true?

so
to
that
extent,
too,
you
--
could
you
not
distinguish
this
from
the
policy
behind
giving
a
priority
to
wage
payments.
that's
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
employees

we
can
agree
that
it's
a
part
of
their
compensation.
so
with
the
various
other
fringed
benefits
be
part
of
compensation.
but
the
statute
doesn't
use
the
word
compensation,
doesn't
it?
justice

stewart
no,
what
i'm
talking
about
--
taking
an
equivalent
example
would
be
shorter
working
hours,
wouldn't
it
be?
justice

which
you
might
make
through
the
necessity
of
more
employees,
doesn't
it?

for

i
don't

anything
about

read

but
the

want
a
maximum
of
75
hours
a
month
instead
of
85,
which
would
mean
that
perhaps
hiring
more
pilots.
but
that
wouldn't
increase
the

it
would
be
monetarily
measurable
from
the
point
of
view
of

that's
mr.

there's

there,
in

as
to
how

they
were
of

and
how
many

of
