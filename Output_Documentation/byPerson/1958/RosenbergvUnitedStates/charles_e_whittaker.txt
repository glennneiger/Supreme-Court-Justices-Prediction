let's
see
if
i
understand
you.
a
longhand
signed
copy
was
--
or
original
was,
whatever
it
is,
was
given
to
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and,
the
court
had
it
before
it,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
record
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
well
as
the
one
that
was
submitted
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
the
envelope
and
examined
in
camera.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
do
you
argue
that
the
court
couldn't
be
trusted
to
determine
that
they
were
alike?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

you
had
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
in
any
event,
it
was
the
statement
which
was
in
possession
and
was
demanded
and
was
delivered.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
handwritten
copy
was.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and,
my
difficulty
is
in
seeing
that
if
those
were
alike,
whether
you
get
one
copy
or
a
carbon
copy
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
you
say
corroborate,
do
you
mean
not
to
tell
what
were
the
durations
that
she
had
to
find?
