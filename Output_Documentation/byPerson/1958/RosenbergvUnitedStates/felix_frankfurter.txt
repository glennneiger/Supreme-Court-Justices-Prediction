justice

you
saw
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
original
and
the
transcript
invoked
by
the
same
--
attributable
to
the
same
author,
the
same
person?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
nothing
to
indicate
whether
the
typewritten
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
whether
it's
preceded
or
followed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
by
the
same
--
was
the
same
person
responsible
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
contents
of
both?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
judge
passed
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
question
on
that
point
is
not
interpretation
of
meaning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
merely
identity
of
the
symbols.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
--
why
do
you
say
the
origination
is
important?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
one
is
an
identical
copy
of
the
other,
but
you're
concerned
with,
was
there
a
--
was
this
in
contest
that
there
wasn't
somebody
who
wrote
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
invoked
--
they
both
say
the
same
thing.
you
can't
get
any
change
from
if
they're
both
identical,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
change?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but,
i
mean,
if
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
this
of
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
this.
is
it
in
controversy
that
he
signed
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
upon
signing
something,
he
made
that
something
here,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
made
that
something
here,
that
that
something
which
he
made
was
a
copy
of
something
that
had
been
typewritten
or
longhanded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
he
had
copied
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
say
that
he
was
hurshed
in
signing
it,
was
that
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
he
was
going
to
repudiate
that
when
he
signed
to
that
extent,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
couldn't
have
the
same
right
of
discovery
as
the
stuff
when
the
defendants
comes
with
possession,
he
could
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
--
a
very
able
court
of
appeals
says
the
co
--we
reverse
the
conviction
in
which
the
government
has
merely
served
notice
on
the
defendant
to
produce
the
original
as
the
basis
of
introducing
secondary
evidence,
and
that
was
held,
i'm
not
sure
properly,
thought
broadly,
an
invasion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
it
is
in
the
federal
courts,
but
i
have
to
point
--
the
point
of
that
case
was
that
it
was
made
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
thereafter,
all
careful
district
judges
of
the
united
states
or
careful
us
attorneys
asked
the
court
to
excuse
the
jury
so
they
could
do
it
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
i'm
suggesting
the
extent
to
which,
from
my
point
of
view,
very
properly,
protection
is
made
and
this
is
not
--
you
can't
search,
you
can't
--
your
large
statement
about
going
after
the
truth
is
a
large,
big
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
truth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
isn't
what
trials
are
about
usually,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
trials
--
that
isn't
the
nature
of
an
adversary
proceeding,
the
whole
truth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
ought
to
be,
but
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
standing
in
the
defendant
side,
i
should
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
much
--
at
least
as
much
as
i'm
afraid
it's
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
hearsay
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it's
not
admissible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
evidence
--
prosecutor
must
give
evidence
or
materials
in
his
possession
which,
here,
the
conscientious
prosecutor
wouldn't
dare
to
offer
in
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
whole
question
of
the
range
of
impeachment
is
a
question
of
admissibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we're
talking
here
about
impeachment.
all
these
things
are
impeachment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
all
impeachment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
any
different
considerations
apply
when
it
isn't
what
judge
swan
called
the
negative
aspect
of
this
evidence
to
which
--
toward
impeachment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
different
thing
if
you
want
to
have
affirmative
evidence
to
disprove
perjury,
for
instance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
seems
to
be
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
that
if
the
court
knows
in
advance
that
there
are
limits
to
the
purposes
to
which
evidence
may
be
important,
that
it
may
be
a
good
reason
for
not
calling
to
it.
