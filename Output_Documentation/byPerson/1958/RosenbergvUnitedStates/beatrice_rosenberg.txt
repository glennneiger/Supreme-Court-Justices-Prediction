ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
very
much
narrower
than
would
appear
because
of
what
actually
happened
on
this
trial.
now,
let
me
say
just
a
--
one
word
about
the
fact
because
it,
again,
said
the
background
of
what
happened
here
must
be
done.
this
is
a
case
which
the
government's
main
witness,
meierdiercks,
went
to
ms.
vossler.
he
testified,
at
the
direction
of
petitioner
and
offered
to
buy
her
leases,
certain
oil
leases
that
she
had.
in
the
meantime,
according
to
meierdierck,
at
the
direction
of
petitioner,
some
other
persons
who
was
never
identified
also
came
and
fitted
up.
so
that,
eventually,
they
agreed
to
about
$35
an
acre
and,
presumably,
she
was
going
to
sell
all
her
leases
for
$57,000.
well,
the
subject
came
around
discussion
of
her
taxes,
capital
gains
on
that,
and
meierdiercks
said,
“well,
if
you
give
us
10%
down
now,
cash,
this
can
be
handled
as
if
it
was
profits
of
an
oil
company
which
has
a
deduction
and,
so,
that
will
cut
down
your
tax.
but,
you
must
give
us
this
10%
first
before
the
sale.”
as
a
result
of
that,
ms.
meierdiercks
--
meierdiercks
and
ms.
vossler
went
to
philadelphia
where
she
backed.
she
drew
out
a
certified
check
for
$5700
and
gave
it
to
meierdiercks.
now,
he
testified
that
he,
in
turn,
gave
it
to
petitioner.
the
petitioner
went
to
washington
and
bought
some
leases
for
--
he
wasn't
present.
he
testified
that
was
the
arrangement.
the
petitioner
bought
the
leases
and
--
for
ms.
vossler
for
$500
or
$1000
and
then
got
the
balance
of
the
certified
check
in
cash,
and
then,
part
of
that
money
was
given
to
meierdiercks.
now,
ms.
vossler
testified
as
to
her
dealings
with
meierdiercks,
but
she
never
saw
petitioner.she
never
identified
him.
all
that
she
could
do
was
corroborate
meierdiercks
as
to
her
testimony
--
as
to
his
dealings
with
her.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
but
they
were
corroborative
of
his
version
of
what
he
did.
that's
all
i
meant
by
that.
now,
that
was
basically
the
picture
and,
at
the
first
trial,
the
court
had
examined
meierdiercks'
grand
jury
testimony
and
statement
to
the
fbi
and
had
said
there
was
one
item
that
it
thought
significant
to
the
defense.
it
didn't
find
anything
else
contradictory.
that
was
before
jencks.
it
went
up
on
appeal.
by
that
time,
the
jencks
decision
had
come
down
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
then,
this
case
came
on
for
retrial
at
the
time,
as
the
statute
had
been
passed,
but
there
was
this
reversal
of
this
case.
when
it
came
up,
there
was,
the
petitioner
said,
a
pretrial
demand
which
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
jencks
didn't
require
in
the
statute
for
a
bad
pretrial
production.
the
judge
said
that
it
was
clear
that
meierdiercks
would
be
called.
that
the
government,
as
he
recalled,
the
case
--
couldn't
possibly
have
a
case
without
it
and,
therefore,
he
would
arrange
to
have
both
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
sworn
statement
of
meierdiercks
turned
over
to
the
defense.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
day
of
trial,
which
was
not
literally
within
the
statute
because
meierdiercks
had
not
completed
his
direct
testimony,
but
it
was
felt
that,
since
he
was
such
an
important
witness
and
known
to
be
such,
that
would
do
it.
and,
this
was
done,
and
then,
what
happened
appears
in
the
record
at
page
47,
a
little
bit
later.
the
defense
attorney
said
“as
i
remember
the
first
trial,
meierdiercks
testified
that
he
was
interviewed
several
times
by
the
fbi,
but
all
the
government
turned
over
to
me
is
one
signed
statement.”
and,
the
united
states
attorney
said
“now,
this
is
a
situation.
we
do
have
reports
of
--
or
summary
of
interviews
in
addition
to
the
signed
statement.
and,
as
we
read
the
statute,
the
defense
is
not
entitled
to
that.”
that
was
the
united
states
attorney's
position,
but
what
the
court
said
was
“you
had
better
turn
them
over
to
me
and
i
will
look
at
them,
and
i
will
decide
whether
i
think
the
defense
is
entitled
to
them.”
at
this
point,
you
see,
the
united
states
attorney
had
taken
position
that
all
he
had
to
turn
over
was
a
signed
statement.
the
court
had
said
“i
want
to
see
the
summary.”
at
this
point,
the
united
states
attorney
turned
over
its
file
and
the
court
went
through
it,
and
then,
after
doing
that,
the
court
turned
over
to
the
defendant
in
this
case
the
summa
--
the
fbi
summary
of
its
very
first
interview
with
meierdiercks,
that's
c4.
and
then,
it
turned
over
--
it
said
--
the
court's
letter,
it
said
r70-71,
and
it's
printed
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
the
court
also
turned
over
a
note
that
had
been
added
to
the
copy
of
the
signed
statement.
the
court
said,
when
it
turned
it
over,
“i
have
had
the
fbi
report
dated
july
12,
that's
the
date
of
the
signed
statement,
marked
c4.
this
report
contains
a
copy
of
the
statement
of
may
12
--
i'm
sorry,
may
12,
which
i
understand
has
been
delivered
to
you,
and
then,
it
has
the
following
materials”
and
it
turned
over
the
note
that
had
been
put
on
the
copy,
which
was
an
additional
fact
recalled
by
meierdiercks.
and,
it
did
not
turn
over
certain
other
documents
in
the
file.
those
--
it's
sealed.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
did
turn
over
the
summary
of
interviews
with
meierdiercks.
what
was
not
turned
over
is
described
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
we
printed
that
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
that
one
of
the
documents
contained
no
reference
to,
much
less
the
texts
of
any
summation,
text
or
any
summation
of
anything
said
by
either
witness.
two
were
office
memoranda
concerning
the
progress
of
a
then-pending
prosecution
against
meierdiercks.
another
is
a
physical
description
of
meierdiercks.
another
is
an
unsuccessful
search
of
certain
names
on
hotel
registries.
now,
the
court
also
noted
that
there
was
an
office
notation
of
the
fact
that
meierdiercks,
when
arrested,
had
denied
all
implications
in
the
crime.
but,
the
inter
--
the
summary
of
the
interview
where
that
was
done
had
been
turned
over.
so
that,
in
other
words,
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
that,
after
meierdiercks,
everything
had
been
turned
over
except
material
that
was
in
no
sense
attributable
to
meierdiercks,
in
no
sense
whatsoever,
except
insofar
as
there
was
a
copy
attached
to
that
report
of
the
statement
--
of
the
longhand
statement
which
we
have
sought.
now,
as
to
ms.
vossler,
she,
as
i
say,
never
identified
petitioner.
she
was
merely
the
victim
of
this
and
she
dealt
only
with
meierdiercks
and
with
a
man
named
mr.
rice
who
was
never
identified.
she
never
saw
petitioner.
she
didn't
name
him.
as
to
her,
the
court
delivered
--
the
government
delivered
to
the
court
immediately
and
turned
over
a
report
which
she
had
signed,
which
gave
a
detailed
statement
of
what
had
occurred
in
january.
it
also
turned
over
certain
other
summary
which
were
detailed
that
ms.
vossler
has
applied,
including
then,
like
her
speculation
as
to
how
the
defendant
might
possibly
have
gotten
her
name,
in
which
she
named
an
individual
who
never
was
shown
to
have
any
significance
of
the
crime
and
in
which
she
--
and
which
happened
also
to
contain
facts
that
she
hadn't
identified
certain
other
individuals.
the
court
turned
all
that
over
nevertheless,
and
then,
he
said
“the
united
states
attorney
has
also
turned
over
to
me,”
because
the
united
states
attorney
had
turned
over
his
file
in
view
of
this
dispute
as
to
what
should
be
done,
“certain
letters
and
i
will
look
at
those
letters,
and
i'll
see
if
they
had
anything
to
do
with
the
case.”
and,
so,
he
went
through
that
group
of
letters
and
turned
over
two
which
are
c13
and
c14,
which
the
defense
has
seen,
which
have
some
mention
of
the
case.
they
were
letters
written
after
ms.
vossler
had
testified
at
the
first
trial.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
court
didn't
turnover,
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
thought
should
have
been
turned
over,
were
the
letters
which
was
described
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
follows.
and
that's
at
page
16
of
our
brief,
96
of
the
record.
a
letter
to
the
prosecutor
by
ms.
vossler
just
before
the
second
trial
of
the
case
in
which
she
expressed
concern
that
the
lack
of
time
had
made
her
recollection
of
details
hazy,
so
that,
she
would
have
to
rely
upon
her
previously
detailed
statement
to
refresh
her
memory.
now,
this
was
written
by
ms.
vossler
and,
in
the
very
broadest,
it
may
have
related
to
her
testimony.
but,
it
had
absolutely
no
--
this
is
the
only
statement
that
had
anything
possibly
to
do
with
the
case.
and,
it
is,
i
think,
seriously
questionable
whether
this
can
be
said
to
relate
to
the
subject
matter
of
her
testimony,
but
this
is
the
sole
iss
--
the
sole
document
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
among
the
sealed
exhibits
which
could
possibly
have
been
said
to
be
relevant
insofar
as
they
were
not
duplicated.
and,
as
to
that,
this
is
what
the
defense
said
about
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
the
report
that
they
got,
and
this
is
at
page
64
of
the
record.
the
question
was
--
the
defense
had
asked
for
more
time
to
study
the
reports
of
ms.
vossler,
and
the
question
was,
well,
the
court
said
“do
you
de
--
intend
to
deny
that
these
things
happened?”
and,
trial
counsel
said
“may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
not
denying
the
allegation
that
ms.
vossler
is
making
from
the
stand,
not
in
the
least,
but
there
are
certain
things
that
she
has
not
testified
to
that
are
contained
in
these
other
reports.
there
are
certain
items
which
we
must
assume
are
as
truthful
as
the
statement
she
is
making
here,
and
we
want
to
get
all
this
in
the
record,”
and
that's
what
the
court
--
that's
what
defense
counsel
did.
the
transcript
which
hasn't
been
printed
shows
that
he
had
her
read
her
signed
statement
and
had
her
read
pages
of
these
--
all
reports
to
refresh
her
recollection
so
she
could
give
details.
so
that,
the
failure
to
produce
even
if,
since
time
is
going
short,
it
could
possibly
be
deemed
the
statement,
the
failure
to
produce
this
one
letter
saying
that
her
recollection
was
hazy
can't
be
considered
prejudicial
error
in
view
of
the
fact
that
whole
statement
of
the
defense
was
“we
want
to
use
these
statements
because”
--
at
one
point,
he
had
said,
“we
want
to
use
these
statements
to
get
in
this
material
which
she
hasn't
testified
to,”
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
harmless
error
in
relation
to
these
problems.
this
court,
in
the
kotteakos
case,
went
through
the
whole
history
of
the
harmless
error
statute
which,
as
to
criminal
cases,
is
embodied
in
rule
52.
and,
we
--
there
is
one
sentence
of
it
that
i
think
summarizes
what
that
whole
history
said,
and
that
is
that
the
object
of
the
statute
was
simple
to
substitute
judgment
for
automatic
application
of
rules,
to
preserve
review
as
a
check
upon
arbitrary
action
and
essential
unfairness
in
trial
but,
at
the
same
time,
to
make
the
process
perform
that
function
without
giving
men,
fairly
convicted,
the
multiplicity
of
loopholes
which
any
highly
rigid
and
minutely
detailed
scheme
of
errors,
especially
in
relation
to
procedure,
will
engender
and
reflect
in
a
printed
record.
now,
this,
as
the
court
went
on
to
the
say
in
kotteakos,
is
easier
to
say
than
to
apply.
but
it
seems
to
me,
the
important
thing
is
that
it
does
involve
judgment
and,
so,
it
can't
be
said
that
just
because
we
don't
know
what
the
defense
might
have
done
with
something
if,
in
the
judgment
of
the
whole
case,
whatever
the
defense
would
have
done
with
it,
it
really
has
no
significant
relation
to
the
case,
there
must
be
judgment.
and,
in
this
case,
as
it
happens,
we
don't
even
have
to
speculate
about
what
the
defense
would
have
done.
we
know.
the
defense
said
“what
we
want
to
do,
we
know
ms.
vossler
is
telling
the
truth.”
they
repeated
that
in
argument
to
the
jury.
they
said
“we're
not
denying
ms.
vossler
is
telling
the
truth,
but
she
didn't
implicate
petitioner.”
they
said
“what
we
want
to
do
with
these
statements
is
to
put
in
the
fact
that
she
forgotten.”
then,
on
that
basis,
it
can't
be
said
that
the
fact
that
they
didn't
have
a
letter
which
takes
it
--
isn't
really
a
statement
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
but
which
merely
reflects
the
fact
that,
in
time,
her
memory
had
gotten
somewhat
hazy,
something
the
defense
absolutely
knew
and
relied
upon
to
get
in
material
which
is
only
very
remotely
relevant.
in
view
of
that
fact,
it
is
clear
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
that
judgment
--
there's
hardly
judgment
involved.
but,
even
in
a
somewhat
other
type
of
case,
it
does
become
necessary
to
look
at
possible
errors,
if
there
could
be,
in
relation
to
the
whole
case
and
that
there
cannot
be
any
kind
of
an
automatic
rule
saying,
merely
because
we
do
not
what
a
defense
might
have
done
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
even
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
or
a
statutory
right
that
it's
less
open
in
kotteakos
but,
nevertheless,
for
example,
let's
take
a
motion
to
suppress
which
should
have
been
granted
as
to,
let's
say,
two
grains
of
narcotics,
a
theoretical
case.
when
one
can't
cover
those
two
grains
and
42
other
grains,
which
are
completely
proofed,
that
is,
as
i
read
the
kotteakos
decision
and
the
history
which
it
embodied,
let
me
say
that
the
kotteakos
decision
does
leave
open
the
question
of,
possibly,
a
constitutional
or
statutory
right.
but,
if
you
read
the
history
they
had
set
forth
and
what
congress
is
trying
to
do
and
what,
in
a
sense,
the
appellate
function
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
even
so,
even
if
it's
a
constitutional
right,
ther
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
an
appellate
court
is
still
not
automatically,
just
finding
that,
required
to
reverse.
no
matter
how
insignificant
the
error,
no
matter
how
unimportant
the
witness
or,
as
in
this
case,
in
a
situation
where
we
know
that
what
the
defense
was
trying
to
do
was
to
improve
her
recollection
rather
than
show
that
it
was
hazy.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that,
therefore,
there
has
to
be
judgment.
now,
there
are
certain
things,
of
course,
that
change
the
judgment.
if
--
if
you're
dealing
with
something
like
a
confession,
and
that's
the
example
the
kotteakos
case
gives,
there
is
something
the
--
there
can
always
be
a
doubt
if
you
don't
have
the
defending
admitting
--
the
defendant
admitting
it
himself.
therefore,
the
courts
have
said
a
confession,
by
and
large,
is
so
inherently
difficult,
that
no
matter
how
great
the
proof,
we
will
reverse
if
we
find
the
confession
was
not
properly
given.
but,
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
this
witness
or,
in
some
of
the
other
cases,
where
you
have
a
situation
where,
if
that
material
was
used
to
the
ultimate
reach
that
any
possible
person
could
reach
it,
even
so,
it
simply
really
didn't
go
to
the
issues
in
the
case.
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
where
you
have
room
for
doubt,
room
for
difficulty,
it's
one
thing.
but,
here,
you
have
a
case
of
a
judge
who
did
as
he
said,
“lean
over
backwards.”
there
isn't
any
question
in
the
world
that
if
he
thought
this
letter
would
have
been
the
slightest
bit
useful
to
the
defendant,
he
would
have
handed
it
over.
but
that,
in
view
of
all
that
they
had
and
in
view
of
the
little
that
was
not
given
to
them
which,
as
i
say
in
this
case,
we
know
that
they
didn't
intend
to
use
then,
it
seems
to
me,
an
appellate
court
would
not
be
doing
justice
if
it
reversed
on
such
ground.
there's
one
other
topic
that
i
think
i
should
cover
because
it
wasn't
reached
and
it
was
raised
to
enact
this
matter
of
pretrial
discovery.
jencks
didn't
involve
pretrial
discovery.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
wasn't
raised
in
petition
for
certiorari.
it's
here
only
in
the
sense
that
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
includes
a
question
where
the
jencks
is
a
rule
of
mere
procedure
or
involved
a
defendant's
constitutional
right.
and,
apparently,
the
petitioner
has
said
that
constitutional
rights
include
the
right
to
pretrial
discovery.
i
was
about
to
say
that
in
the
government's
view,
this
question
is
not
properly
here
because
it
was
not
raised.
and,
in
turn,
it
was
not
argued
in
petition
for
certiorari.
i
can
also
say
that,
it
seems
to
me,
the
language
could
not
be
clearer.
and
the
legislative
history
just
confirmed
the
absolute
clearness
of
the
congressional
decision
that
these,
according
to
statements
that
are
involved
in
this
legislation,
shall
not
be
produced
until
after
the
witness
has
testified.
now,
of
course,
it
is
true
that
rule
16
and
rule
17,
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
bowman
dairy
case,
reached
documents
of
another
kind
that
don't
involve
statements
by
the
witnesses
but,
as
the
statements
of
government
witnesses.
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
is
decisive
that
congress
made
the
decision
that
those
should
not
be
produced
until
trial,
that
they
should
not
be
produced
pretrial.
and,
it
seems
to
me,
clearly
a
subject
matter
on
which
congress
had
the
right
to
legislate
because
the
right
to
get
this
material
pretrial
was
not
known
before.
and
it
was
the
subject
of
controversy
at
the
district
court
level
just
in
a
sense,
it
was
a
--
something
just
beginning
to
be
talked
about
before
the
statute
was
passed,
and
then,
congress
made
a
definite
decision
between
two
conflicting
points
of
view
on
that
issue
and
decided
that
these
should
be
produced
at
the
trial.
