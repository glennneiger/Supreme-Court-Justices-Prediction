mr.
edward
m.
dangel
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
--
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
was
tried
upon
an
indictment
that
contained
two
counts,
first
count,
for
having
transported
in
interstate
commerce
a
check
that
was
procured
by
fraud.
the
second
count,
for
a
conspiracy
between
himself,
one
meierdiercks,
and
an
unknown
person
called
mr.
rice
in
the
indictment.
he
was
found
guilty
after
two
trials.
the
first
trial
was
reversed
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
first
trial
was
before
the
jencks
decision
and
before
the
so-called
jencks
act.
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
not
given
fbi
material
or
statements
reports,
and
was
not
provided
with
the
grand
jury
minutes
concerning
two
principal
witnesses,
one
meierdiercks
and
one
ms.
vossler,
ms.
vossler
being
the
victim
of
the
fraud.
the
jencks
act
had
not
been
passed.
then,
he
was
tried
again
before
the
same
judge
after
the
jencks
act
was
passed.
and
during
the
trial,
he
was
deprived
of
the
material
of
which
we
now
complain,
fbi
reports
and
some
statements.
and
the
court
of
--
and
the
judge,
i'll
go
into
this
much
more
fully
later,
claimed
he
was
acting
both
under
the
jencks
act
and
under
the
jencks
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
confirmed
the
conviction
and
they
acted
under
the
jencks
act
and
the
jencks
decision,
although
they
don't
say
so.
the
district
attorney
or
united
states
attorney
adheres
strictly
in
his
contentions
to
the
jencks
act.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
grounds,
first,
whether
the
rule
on
the
jencks
case
was
a
rule
of
mere
procedure
or
did
it
involve
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
then,
again,
whether
or
not
a
clear
violation
of
the
rule
was
harmless
error,
whether
the
conceded
error
of
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
--
there
was
error,
error
in
withholding
from
counsel
prior
statements
of
a
principal
government
witness
could
be
excused
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
found
that
the
defense
was
not
hampered
in
cross-examination
of
those
witnesses
concerning
material
that's
in
a
sealed
envelope
that's
never
been
seen
by
the
petitioner.
and,
another
part
of
the
certiorari
is
that
it
is
proper
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
determine
what
use
defense
counsel
might
have
made
of
the
statements
erroneously
withheld.
the
--
the
case,
when
it
came
up
for
trial
again
and
prior
thereto,
the
defendant
made
two
motions.
the
third
one,
which
is
not
too
important
for
a
continuance,
the
two
motions
were
that
he
be
allowed
to
inspect
before
trial
the
statements
of
meierdiercks,
who
was
the
principal
witness
and
vossler,
who
was
also
a
principal
witness
and
who
the
judge
knew,
all
the
judges
knew,
had
to
be
material
witnesses
or
the
government
had
no
case.
it
was
first
presented
to
the
assignment
judge
whose
ruling
was
that,
because
of
the
jencks
act,
he
could
not
allow
the
motions
at
that
time.
the
preposition
being
stated
to
him
that
it
would
delay
the
trial
and
interrupt
the
trial,
and
so
forth,
and
a
--
the
judge
said
no.
he
was
bound
to
wait
until
the
witness
testified,
although
he
knew
and
everybody
else
knew
that
those
witnesses
were
bound
to
testify.
however,
he
put
a
loophole
in
his
ruling
to
this
extent.
he
said
“you
may
renew
this
request
again
to
the
trial
judge.”
and,
the
request
was
renewed
to
the
trial
judge
who,
as
i
say,
was
the
same
judge
who
tried
the
case
first,
and
his
remarks
in
the
record
show
that
he
knows
just
what
the
government
needs
because
he
said
the
government
cannot
prove
this
case,
unless
mr.
meierdiercks
testifies.
they
might
leave
out
ms.
vossler
but
i
don't
see
how
they
could
do
it.
however,
he
denied
the
motion
again
not
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
as
i
read
the
record,
but
as
a
matter
that
he
was
bound
to
wait
until
the
witness
testified.
now,
at
the
trial,
mr.
meierdiercks
was
not
only
the
main
witness,
but
the
only
witness
who
implicates
the
defendant.
and,
mr.
meierdiercks,
who
himself
was
a
confessed
criminal
in
not
only
this
particular
activity
but
running
many,
many
years
with
a
long
criminal
career,
had
made
statements
to
the
fbi.
the
first
statement
that
he
made
was
that
he
was
in
no
way
implicated
in
any
wrong
doing.
he
then
made
another
statement
in
which
he
again
denied
that
he
had
done
anything
wrong
or
that
he
knew
the
petitioner
rosenberg.
now,
there
were
two
interviews
with
mr.
meierdiercks
before
he
made
a
written
statement.
those
two
appear
at
the
bottom
of
page
46
and
they
were
not
given
to
the
defendant.
i
might
say,
at
this
point,
that
never
did
the
government
asked
the
judge
to
edit
any
reports
or
material
in
its
possession,
although
i
believe
that
the
government's
brief
says
that
the
judge
could
edit
what
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
defendant.
i
don't
believe
that
mr.
bechtle's
objections
were
based
upon
anything
except
the
fact
that
3500
did
not
permit
these
papers
to
be
given
to
the
because
they
were
not
signed
by
mr.
meierdiercks,
they
were
not
approved
by
him,
they
were
not
adopted
by
him,
nor
were
they
verbatim.
he
rested
on
3500.
now,
these
two
reports
to
the
fbi
agents
are
interviews
with
mr.
meierdiercks
but
they
were
not
given
to
the
defendant.
i
believe
they
are
in
the
sealed
envelope.
this
--
most
of
the
material
that
i
can
tell
you
about
appears
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
page
94.
judge
hasty
has,
there,
revealed
the
contents
of
these
papers.
now,
what
the
judge
did,
he
examined
them
himself.
he
took
charge
and
he
examined
them
in
camera.
he
never
allowed
the
defendant
to
know
any
of
the
contents
and,
in
connection
with
exhibits
5
and
6,
he
gave
part
of
those
exhibits,
pages
2
and
4,
i
believe,
of
exhibit
6
and
certain
parts
of
exhibit
5.
that's
c5
and
c6,
his
own
exhibit,
the
court's
exhibit,
but
he
wouldn't
show
the
rest
and
the
rest,
i
believe,
is
also
contained
in
the
sealed
envelope.
there
are
also
two
office
memoranda
of
the
fbi
concerning
the
progress
and
procedure
of
a
then-pending
prosecution
against
meierdiercks.
that's
also
page
95
of
the
record.
there's
another
paper
which
contains
the
detailed
physical
description
and
summary
and
personal
history
of
meierdiercks.
still,
another
is
a
record
of
an
unsuccessful
search
for
certain
names
on
hotel
registers
on
or
about
the
time
of
the
crime.
the
--
then,
he
says
“these
and
other
miscellaneous
items
from
the
prosecution's
files
were
obviously
not
germane
to
the
request
of
the
defendant.”
why
the
prosecution
produced
them
is
not
clear.
their
surrender
could
not
have
been
responsive
to
the
defense's
request
or
to
any
proper
request
for
whatever
records
the
government
had,
in
verbatim
text
or
otherwise,
of
prior
statements
of
certain
witnesses.
these
were
given
to
the
judge.
and
then,
he
says
there
--
in
addition,
there
was
a
minute
or
office
notation,
stating
of
fact
that,
on
the
first
questioning,
meierdiercks
had
denied
any
involvement
and
any
alleged
wrong
doing.
then,
there
was
a
typewritten
copy
of
a
detailed
statement
of
meierdiercks
about
the
crime.
the
court
of
appeals
says
there
that
the
handwritten
copy
was
the
original.
how
do
we
know
that
it
was
the
original?
it
is
a
--
it
is
exhibit
2.
it's
court's
exhibit
no.
2
or
maybe
government's
exhibit
no.
2.
it's
a
10
or
a
12-page
handwritten
statement
which
meierdiercks
testified
--
it's
c2,
court
exhibit
2.
meierdiercks
testified
that,
upon
questioning
by
the
fbi
agent,
the
fbi
agent
wrote
a
lot
of
things
and
he
was
hesitant
about
it.
he
wasn't
cooperative,
and
then,
he
became
cooperative,
and
the
statement
was
finally
presented
to
him
and
he
signed
it.
and,
i
saw
it
this
morning
in
the
clerk's
office
and
is
witnessed
by
two
special
agents
of
the
fbi.
but,
the
typewritten
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
saw
--
i
saw
that
one
because
that
was
an
exhibit,
your
honor.
that
was
not
withheld.
the
thing
that
was
withheld
was
the
typewritten
copy,
and
i've
dared
say
that
a
skillful
cross-examiner
might
have
been
able
to
show
that
the
typewritten
copy
was
the
original
and
that
the
fbi
agent's
copy,
the
typewritten
copy,
and,
from
that,
mr.
meierdiercks
attached
his
signature.
all
i
say
is
that,
if
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
this
material,
he
was
entitled
to
make
such
use
of
it
as
might
have
been
available
to
him.
that
is
to
say,
the
record
at
page
96
says,
as
the
court
of
appeals
finds,
that
the
handwritten
one
was
the
original.
now,
i
don't
know
how
the
court
of
appeals
reaches
that
conclusion.
certainly,
they
really
--
the
court
of
appeals
reaches
that
conclusion
without
any
statement
from
the
defendant
or
without
any
evidence
except
as
they
look
at
the
papers.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
yes,
sir?
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
yes,
it
was
given
to
the
defendant.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
it
had
it.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
in
camera.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i'm
not
--
i
don't
say
the
language
isn't
alike.
all
i
say
is,
which
is
the
original?
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
i
should
imagine
that,
in
cross-examination,
it
might
be
immaterial
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
meierdiercks
originated
this
statement
which
was
written
down,
exhibit
c2,
or
whether
somebody
else
originated
that
statement.
this
is
cross-examination.
how
frequently
do
you
compare
a
typewritten
copy
with
a
handwritten
copy
in
cross-examination?
and
then,
again,
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
whether
there
was
some
deviation
in
that
copy.
the
defendant
has
never
seen
it.
is
it
fair
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
that
determination
without
the
defendant
seeing
it
or
having
an
opportunity?
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
in
the
writing
of
an
f
--
of
fbi
agents
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
either
one
or
two.
and,
the
only
fact
on
this
10
or
12-page
document
is
that
it
concerns
the
witness'
signature
at
the
end
and
witnessed
by
two
special
agents
of
the
fbi.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
we
can't
tell
you
really.
we
can't
tell,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
one
is
typewritten.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
and
the
other
is
handwritten.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
preceded
the
handwriting?
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
have
never
seen
it,
nor
has
the
petitioner
ever
seen
it.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
it,
first,
the
judge,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
no
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
yes.
origination
is
the
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
the
origination
of
the
paper
is
important.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
this
is
a
contest
as
to
whether
somebody
said
something.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
it's
a
contest
whether
meierdiercks
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
you
can
get
some
change
in
it.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
you
get
the
change
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
presented
to
him
for
his
signature,
or
whether
or
not
it
was
written
at
the
time
he
said
it
was
written
because
of
questioning
of
the
fbi
agents.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
it
was
not
delivered.
that's
a
--
the
typewritten
copy
was
not
delivered.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
the
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
yes,
that's
right,
the
handwritten
copy.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
it
is
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
that
isn't
the
my
--
i
guess
i
have
not
made
my
point
clear.
i
was
trying
to
make
the
point
that
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
one
is
the
original
rather
than
the
other
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
without
any
--
without
the
defendant
being
able
to
combat
that
or
in
anyway
explain
it
or
to
know
about
it
seems
to
me
to
be
depriving
of
him
of
something
that's
of
value
to
him.
for
example,
on
cross-examination,
if
the
defendant
could
show
that
this
statement
which
meierdiercks
signed
was
merely
a
copy
of
what
had
been
previously
prepared
by
somebody,
and
this
thing
was
just
put
in
front
of
his
nose
and
“here,
you
sign
this,”
it
would
be
of
great
value
as
to
whether
he
was
telling
the
truth
that
he
had
in
--
he
had
this
third
or
fourth
interview
with
an
fbi
agent
and
gave
the
material
which
the
fbi
agent
wrote
down
as
he
went
along,
or
whether
it
wasn't
a
--
something
already
cooked
up.
i
submit
that
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
it's
true
to
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
it's
not
in
--
it's
not
in
con
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
it
would
make
some
difference
in
cross-examination
and
in
value
to
his
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
originated
the
thought
that
were
in
that
paper.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
i
s
--
well,
your
honor
says
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
no,
it
was
this
in
--
this
was
in
the
case,
that
he
intended
a
benefit
from
signing.
that
is
to
say,
he
in
--
he,
very
frankly,
admitted
that
he
was
incarcerated
at
the
time
and
that
he
expected
that,
by
cooperating
with
the
fbi,
that
he
would
be
shown
leniency
and
consideration.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
that
might
be
so.
i
mean,
he
--
that's
not
the
direct
evidence.
to
go
along
a
little
further,
ms.
vossler
was
an
important
witness.
and
ms.
vossler
had
written
a
series
of
letters
to
the
united
states
attorney.
those
letters
were
not
shown
to
the
defendant.
the
judge
examined
them
in
camera.
and,
while
he
allowed
one
letter
to
be
introduced
or
two
letters
to
be
introduced,
the
great
bulk
of
the
series
of
letters
were
not.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
has
examined
those
letters
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
they
were
of
no
material
value
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
could
not
use
those
letters
for
any
impeachment
purposes
and,
consequently,
although
there
was
error
in
not
allowing
the
defendant
to
have
those
letters
yet
that
error
was
harmless.
now,
i
submit
this
all
adds
--
all
adds
up
to
one
thing.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
trial
judge,
in
--
in
denying
new
trial
and
making
his
rulings
during
the
trial,
he
has
cited
his
authority,
his
--
the
jencks
act
and
the
jencks
decision.
and,
in
his
statements,
he
has
said
to
the
petitioner,
“i'm
going
to
give
you
more
than
you're
entitled,”
but
he
didn't.
he
--
it's
true
that
he
--
he
allowed
him
to
look
at
the
grand
jury
minutes
of
mr.
meierdiercks
before
meierdiercks'
direct
examination
was
completed.
he
allowed
him
to
look
at
some
of
the
statements
of
meierdiercks,
those
that
were
introduced
in
evidence,
overnight.
and,
the
next
day,
in
a
40-minute
recess,
he
allowed
him
to
look
at
some
of
the
material
of
meierdiercks
and
some
of
the
material
of
ms.
vossler.
it's
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
3500
is
unconstitutional.
it
--
at
first
blush,
they
were
to
look
as
if
congress
was
attempting
to
usurp
the
function
of
this
court.
it
will
look,
at
first
blush,
as
if
congress
were
trying
to
dictate
what
constitutes
due
process
and
that
congress
was
attempting
to
dictate
what
should
be
considered
a
fair
trial
when
it
came
to
material
in
its
possession
which
concerned
government
witnesses.
in
the
jencks
decision,
this
court
has
empathically
said
that
in-camera
examination
is
condemned.
and,
doesn't
justice
require
that
an
in-camera
examination
in
a
criminal
case
should
not
exist?
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
no.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
no,
i
don't
believe
that
this
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
language
spells
out
exactly
constitutional
except
underlying
it.
it
seems
to
me,
fairness
of
trial,
decency
to
a
defendant,
it
seems
to
me,
that's
a
constitutional
ground,
but
there
is
no
language
in
there
that
says
this
is
on
a
constitutional
ground.i
don't
read
it
that
way.
but,
when
you
get
to
a
criminal
trial,
the
investigation
stage
ought
to
be
over
or
pretty
near
or
they've
now
--
the
government,
then,
has
pointed
the
finger
at
the
man
and
said
“here,
you're
the
man.
you
are
guilty
of
this
crime.”
should
a
government,
then,
conceal
from
a
man,
withhold
from
a
man
what
material
there
is?
i
mean,
this
is
not
a
question
of
national
security
and
this
is
not
a
question
of
state
secrets.
this
is
a
question
of
the
government
accusing
a
man
of
a
crime.
it
doesn't
involve
either
one
of
those
things.
haven't
we
got
to
the
stage
now
where
a
discovery
is
important
in
a
criminal
case,
pretrial,
and
otherwise,
just
as
it
is
in
a
civil
case?
haven't
we
changed
from
what
used
to
be
a
game
of
tricks
in
the
trial,
as
judge
bazelon
calls
it,
a
combat
by
surprise?
haven't
we
got
to
the
point
now
where
a
trial
is
not
only
to
determine
the
truth
but
where
all
truths,
not
half
truths,
are
told
to
a
defendant,
but
he
is
given
the
availability?
almost
all
i
have
available
to
him,
just
as
to
the
government,
whatever
material
the
government
has
concerning
those
witnesses
which
the
government
puts
on
the
stand
and
said
“here,
place
credence
in
this
man
to
accuse
the
other
man,
and
find
the
other
man
guilty
of
a
crime.”
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
some
things,
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
yes.
if
i
were
tried
for
arson
and
i
had
in
my
possession
in
the
courtroom
a
fire
insurance
policy.
the
government
could
compel
me
to
produce
that
policy.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
i'm
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i'm
reminded
of
the
massachusetts
case
which
is
--
such
an
evidence
is
admissible
upon
secondary
evidence
admissible
upon
the
defendant's
refusing
to
produce
the
policy
which
was
in
its
possession.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
oh
i
see.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
know.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
know.
it
is.
the
whole
truth
is
what
i
--
is
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
is
what
it
comes
down
to.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
yes,
and
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
i
--
it
ought
to
be.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
it
ought
to
be.
i
just
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
i
--
in
a
criminal
case,
however,
i
should
think
that
anything
that's
available
to
the
defendant,
if
it's
in
the
possession
of
the
government,
and
that
bears
upon
the
credence
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
including
hearsay
evidence
in
the
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i'm
sorry,
but
it's
of
an
--
it's
of
advantage
to
the
defendant
in
this
way,
that
if
the
hearsay
evidence
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
this
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
this
is
a
matter
of
production.
it's
not
a
matter
of
admissibility
and,
if
the
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
but
i
--
do
you
intend
the
jencks
decision
to
be
confined
to
impeachment
or
don't
--
do
you
intend
the
jencks
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
i
agree
that,
up
to
this
point,
i've
heard
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
but,
i
--
i,
however
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
however
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
well,
first,
production,
and
then,
admissibility.
i
submit
that
if
there
is
corroborative
evidence
in
some
of
those
statements,
the
defendant
ought
to
be
entitled
to
have
it,
regardless
of
impeachment.
i'll
just
finish
on
the
question
of
unconstitutionality.
the
time,
this
--
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
excuse
me.
mr.
edward
m.
dangel
but
this
is
production.
i
tried
to
draw
the
distinction
between
production
and
admissibility.
i,
first,
think
the
defendant
sees
it,
then,
the
judge
passes
on
it.
that's
a
different
proposition.
second,
i'd
like
to
point
out,
on
unconstitutionality,
this
statute
gives
a
time
when
the
defendant
is
going
to
get
these
papers.
as
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
have
pointed
out,
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
you're
asked
to
examine
a
witness
of
state.
you're
going
to
keep
the
jury
and
going
to
keep
the
judge
waiting,
and
you're
going
to
hurry
off
to
give
the
officer
in
any
room
to
look
over
this
stuff
and,
for
the
first
time,
determine.
you
are
being
deprived.
the
defendant
is
being
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
preparing
his
case
properly
if
you
have
to
wait
until
that
period.
the
third
thing
is
the
limitation
of
the
papers.
that
the
witness
--
it
must
be
a
paper
that's
signed
by
him,
that's
adopted
by
him,
that
is
in
a
verbatim
transcription.
if
that's
the
situation,
then
i
--
i
submit
that
congress
has
attempted
to
state
what
is
due
process
and
what
is
a
fair
trial,
and
i
believe
that
congress
has
gone
too
far.
thank
you.
