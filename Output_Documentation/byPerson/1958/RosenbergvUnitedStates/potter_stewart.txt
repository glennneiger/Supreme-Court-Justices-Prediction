justice
potter
stewart
ms.
rosenberg,
assuming
that
this
letter
was
a
statement,
as
defined
in
subparagraph
(e)
of
the
statue,
in
passing
that
question,
assuming
it
was
such
a
statement,
aren't
we
dealing
here
with
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
which
imposes
an
absolute
duty
upon
a
district
judge?
it
speaks
in
terms
that
the
court
shall,
on
motion,
of
the
defendant
or
the
united
states
to
produce
and
the
court
dis
--
the
court
shall
order
it
to
be
delivered
directly
to
the
defendant.
in
other
words,
you
are
making
a
--
it
may
be
a
very
valid
argument,
but
shouldn't
it
have
been
addressed
to
congress
before
it
enacted
to
this
statute
which
imposes
an
absolute
duty
and
allows
the
court
no
discretion
at
all,
if
it
is
a
statement
within
subparagraph
(e)?
