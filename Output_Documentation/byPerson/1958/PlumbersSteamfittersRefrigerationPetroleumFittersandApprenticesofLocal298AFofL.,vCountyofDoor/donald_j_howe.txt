mr.
donald
j.
howe
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
door
county
et
al.
that
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
determination
of
the
applicability
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
the
factual
situation
and
i
would
like
to
go
in
a
little
more
in
detail
to
the
factual
situation.
door
county
had
in
the
course
of
--
of
its
functioning
as
a
municipal
government
let
contracts
for
the
construction
of
this
courthouse
addition.
the
contracts
were
left
as
mr.
previant
has
said
to
one
nonunion
contractor
and
nine
or
ten
union
contractors
as
soon
as
the
nonunion
contractor
went
on
the
job,
a
picket
was
placed
on.
at
that
time,
the
courthouse
was
partially
in
the
state
of
construction.
the
record
shows
that
there
was
interference
with
the
business
and
conduct
of
the
operation
of
the
governmental
offices
in
the
courthouse.
the
problem
then
was
what
to
do.
we
had
let
the
bids
as
the
wisconsin
statute
states
to
the
lowest
responsible
bidder
as
a
requirement
of
the
law.
the
law
required
that
there
be
separate
plumbing,
heating
and
ventilating,
electrical
and
construction
contracts
so
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
join
the
plumbing
contract
with
the
general
contract.
the
--
i
believe
that
the
cases
under
wisconsin
law
states
that
we
couldn't
use
tax
money
to
buy
us
contract
or
to
pay
them
the
profit
on
this
contractor
and
say
we're
going
to
give
them
another
contract
because
i
believe
that
that
would
be
an
illegal
use
of
funds.
the
--
although
i
didn't
know
it
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
in
the
no
man's
land.
so
the
process
of
construction
in
the
courthouse
was
at
a
standstill.
the
only
recourse
that
we
had
was
to
apply
to
the
circuit
court
for
an
injunction.
and
the
injunction
was
granted
within
ten
days,
which
of
course
did
not
impede
for
commerce,
rather,
accelerated
them.
it's
those
facts
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes
sir,
it
was
finished
in
like
october,
yes
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
that
factual
situation
to
which
we
have
to
relate
the
interpretation
of
a
person,
an
employer-employee
under
its
federal
act.
the
20
--
local
25,
the
piggy-back
case
of
course
referred
to
railroads
and
because
the
railway
management
act
excludes
employer-employee
relationships.
that
was
carried
through
into
the
313,
the
electrical
workers
313
case,
which
is
the
stumbling
block
in
this
case.
if
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
right
and
their
decision
didn't
go
into
basis
with
the
decision.
it
merely
said
the
national
labor
relations
board
took
jurisdiction
and
we
will
go
with
that.
the
board
had
--
in
a
case
involving
a
municipality,
similar
to
this.
the
board
had
previously
said
a
municipality
is
not
a
person
under
the
act.
the
local
25
case
changed
the
determination
of
the
board
and
under
the
313
case,
the
third
circuit
court
says,
no,
you
may
in
a
situation
like
this
bring
your
action
before
the
board
where
it
involves
a
municipality
because
a
municipality
is
defined
as
a
person
under
the
act.
the
peculiar
situation
it
seems
to
me
involved
here
is
that
under
the
definition
of
the
act,
the
state
has
control
of
its
employer-employee
relationships,
but
when
a
stranger
picket
comes
on
the
job
affecting
the
aberration
of
the
municipality,
there
is
no
control,
and
it
would
seem
that
in
the
aberration
of
the
municipality,
it
would
be
more
important,
or
at
least
as
important
to
have
control
of
stranger
picketing
as
--
such
as
took
place
in
this
particular
case.
the
board
--
the
--
this
court
has
many
times
stated
that
the
areas
of
control
by
the
state
are
left
open.
there
is
no
determination
made
which
rules
this
case
other
than
the
third
circuit
court
case.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
there
is
no
present
controversy,
your
honor,
except
in
--
that
there
is
a
permanent
injunction
of
fact
at
the
moment,
but
the
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
no,
that
isn't
the
controversy,
your
honor,
the
courthouse
is
completed
the
--
everything
is
done.
it's
just
that
the
injunction
is
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
the
only
thing
pending
is
the
fact
that
the
permanent
injunction
is
still
on
effect,
but
it
has
no
actual
effect
because
the
courthouse
is
complete.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
if
there
were
another
contract
or
--
or
additional
construction,
the
injunction
would
still
be
effective.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
that's
right,
your
honor,
it
would
only
be
if
it
were
the
same
factual
situation
where
you
have
the
union
another
contract.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
i
didn't
understand
you,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
i
would
say
that
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
it
would
be
an
additional
work
upon
that
particular
courthouse.
it
would
be
only
be
effective
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
injunction
is
specific,
i
believe,
and
that
it
states
that
no
picketing
at
this
courthouse
construction
site.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
i
don't
believe
it
operates
on
anything,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
that
courthouse
addition
is
now
completed.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
the
courthouse
is
functioning,
everything
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
the
county
state
of
door
county
is
sturgeon
bay,
wisconsin,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor,
we
had
to
provide
bond.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
i
believe
the
bond
is
probably
ceased
to
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
--
construction.
no
--
yes
--
the
injunction
bond
would,
i
assume,
still
be
outstanding.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
to
secure
damages
as
i
recall
it,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
i
misinterpreted
your
question.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
it
--
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it
was
a
principle
in
the
bond.
i'm
quite
sure
it
was.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
call
upon
them.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
i
assume
that
that's
a
provision
of
the
bond,
your
honor.
i
--
i'm
not
certain
whether
attorney's
fees
would
be
part
of
it
or
not.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
cost,
i
would
assume,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
i
believe
that
there
may
be
provision
in
the
statute
for
enlarging
the
bond
if
necessary
in
order
to
keep
the
injunction.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
that
would
be
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
bond
to
cover
such
costs,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
that's
right,
your
honor,
the
bond
is
about
anything
like
that.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
i
don't
know
what
the
amount
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
but
i
--
if
i
my
proceed
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
it
--
it's
really
a
suit
for
a
great
deal
more
than
that,
your
honor.
it
involves
the
area
of
no
man's
land,
which
was
instituted
by
the
guss
case,
which
is
of
course
a
source
of
a
great
deal
of
problems.
in
the
petitioners'
argument,
they
cite
the
fact
that
their
great
deal
of
instruction
will
be
affected
by
this
decision.
the
fact
situation
which
can't
be
overlooked
is
that
there
are
many,
many
areas
of
illegal
activity,
which
have
no
recourse
under
the
present
law.
the
operation
of
the
guss
case
in
taking
away
from
the
state
courts
any
jurisdiction
even
though
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
said
it
cannot
exercise
jurisdiction
because
of
a
limited
ability,
has
multiplied
the
problems
of
everyone
who
has
to
deal
with
labor
relations
problems
because
you
have
illegal
activity,
which
is
uncontrolled
and
uncontrollable
and
the
--
apparently,
there
is
no
legislation,
which
is
in
the
process
now
to
control
that
situation
and
i
would
suggest
that
i
would
take
the
position
that
this
area
should
be
limited
rather
than
extended
because
if
this
case
is
decided
for
the
petitioner,
it
will
extend
this
area
of
no
man's
land
all
through
any
contracts
dealing
with
counties
and
extend
it
beyond
the
position
of
the
board
before
the
local
25
case
because
under
the
25
case
of
course,
the
county
will
then
--
if
the
amount
of
construction
was
too
small
being
a
no
man's
land
area.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
it
was
stipulated
--
mr.
donald
j.
howe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
howe
a
municipal
construction
of
the
cities,
i
would
suggest
that
that
may
be
very
well
be
true.
and
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
there
may
very
well
be
other
statutes
and
other
jurisdictions
that
affect
the
letting
of
contracts
in
the
same
manner
that
the
letting
of
the
contract
was
affected
by
the
wisconsin
statutes,
so
that
it
has
to
be
left
in
a
certain
manner
to
the
lowest
responsible
bidder.
the
petitioner
suggests
that
there's
an
alternative
under
wisconsin
law
that
the
county
can
directly
employ
labor,
which
of
course
removes
the
safeguard
that
the
statute
was
designed
to
impose
to
protect
the
taxpayer's
money
and
not
to
have
a
contract
that's
open
so
that
people
can
enter
into
it
without
the
competitive
bidding
and
without
the
controls
that
the
statute
imposes
on
the
bid
of
contracts.
i
believe
that's
about
all
the
argument
i
have.
