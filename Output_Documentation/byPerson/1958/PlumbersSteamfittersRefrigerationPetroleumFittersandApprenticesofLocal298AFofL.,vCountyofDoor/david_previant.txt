mr.
david
previant
if
the
court
please.
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
it
presents
the
question
whether
the
state
court
had
the
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
peaceful
picketing
at
the
site
of
a
county
building
project
during
the
course
of
a
dispute
between
the
union
and
the
private
contractors
who
were
under
contract
with
the
county
to
build
this
project.
it
involves
the
familiar
question
to
this
court
of
preemption,
question
of
federal
v.
state
powers.
the
facts
are
simple
and
substantially
undisputed.
the
petitioners
are
a
local
labor
union
and
the
building
trades
council
which
is
comprised
of
delegates
from
affiliated
local
unions.
the
respondents
are
the
county
of
door,
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
the
municipal
corporation,
arnold
zahn,
a
plumbing
contractor
and
theodore
oudenhoven,
a
general
contractor.
early
in
1957,
the
county
determined
to
build
an
addition
to
its
existing
courthouse
facility,
and
in
accordance
with
wisconsin's
statute,
let
the
job
out
for
bid.
number
of
individual
craft
bids
were
sought
as
well
as
a
general
contractor
bid.
the
respondent,
oudenhoven
who
was
the
general
contractor
on
the
job
was
an
organized
contractor.
he
was
working
under
contract
with
the
various
labor
unions,
whose
members
were
in
his
employ.
the
respondent,
zahn,
the
successful
bidder
for
the
plumbing
contract
was
an
unorganized
contractor,
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
employees
worked
under
contract
with
the
plumbers'
union
or
were
they
members
of
that
union.
the
petitioners,
that
is
the
plumbers'
union
here,
sought
a
contract
with
zahn
upon
learning
that
he
was
bidding
for
or
had
received
the
bid,
but
they
were
unsuccessful.
when
the
job
started,
a
single
picket
patrolled
the
premises
of
which
the
addition
was
being
constructed.
they
could
carry
the
simple
sign
saying
that
the
employees
were
not
union
and
there
was
--
and
there
is
no
charge
here
that
the
picketing
was
other
than
peaceful
and
in
complete
compliance
with
all
relevant
laws.
as
a
result
of
the
picket
and
as
was
anticipated,
other
union
working
men
employed
by
other
union
contractors
refuse
to
enter
on
the
job
site
to
perform
the
services,
as
a
result
of
which
the
job
came
to
a
stop.
the
--
the
distinguishing
feature
here
from
the
cases
which
have
previously
come
to
this
court
was
here,
the
county,
joined
with
the
two
private
contractors
and
filed
a
joint
complaint
against
the
local
labor
union
and
its
affiliate,
building
trades
council.
claiming
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute
as
that
term
was
defined
under
wisconsin
law,
and
alleging
a
violation
of
wisconsin
statutes,
the
union
defended
both
on
the
merits
on
what
is
relevant
here
on
the
theory
of
preemption.
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
in
this
case,
but
that
there
were
some
$225,000
or
almost
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
of
products
used
on
this
job
which
originated
at
points
outside
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
picketing
was
unlawful,
found
that
it
didn't
comport
with
the
wisconsin
definition
of
a
labor
dispute.
it
also
found
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
the
nonunion
contractor
to
in
turn
force
his
employees
to
join
the
union
against
their
will.
this
is
a
violation
of
a
statute
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
according,
and
also,
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
contract
for
the
union,
trial
court
accordingly
entered
both
temporary
and
finally,
permanent
injunction
against
all
picketing.
the
case
was
then
taken
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
wisconsin
supreme
court
on
the
merits
found
that
there
was
unlawful
picketing
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
the
court
in
--
for
the
basis
of
its
opinion
without
discussing
commerce,
assume
that
there
was
commerce
present,
but
found
that
there
was
no
preemption.
and
it
reason
that
sense
under
the
definition
of
“employer”,
the
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
were
expressly
excluded,
and
since
under
the
definition
of
“person”,
there
was
no
expressed
inclusion
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
therefore,
the
taft-hartley
act
in
any
of
its
aspect
could
not
be
applied
to
the
particular
dispute
and
therefore,
there
was
no
basis
for
it
to
invoke
the
theory
or
to
apply
the
theory
urged
by
the
plaintiff
--
by
the
unions
that
there
was
preemption.
and
coming
to
this
conclusion,
it
stated
its
expressed
disagreement
with
a
prior
holding
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
is
subsequently
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit.
this
was
the
local
313
case
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
in
which
the
board
and
its
brief
amicus
analyzes
very
thoroughly.
there
was
one
concurring
opinion,
which
accepted
the
decision
and
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
presented
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
electrical
workers
case
as
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit.
but
felt
that
there
was
no
preemption
here
because
what
was
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
preemption
here
would
result
in
an
intrusion
on
the
essential
functions
of
local
government.
the
court
reasoned
that
the
construction
of
an
addition
to
a
courthouse
was
such
an
essential
function
of
local
government
that
it
was
not
reasonable,
not
likely
that
congress
could
have
intended
or
that
the
congress
has
in
fact
could
have
prevented
the
state
from
protecting
that
kind
of
a
construction
even
if
a
labor
dispute
arose
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
come
within
the
contents
of
the
board.
there
was
one
dissenting
opinion
who
applied
the
usual
rules
that
have
been
expressed
by
this
court
and
who
have
pointed
out
the
danger
of
conflict
of
remedies
in
this
large
area
of
public
construction
in
the
event
the
majority
has
prevailed.
the
operating
language
of
the
statute
--
i
would
profess
it
by
saying
this.
the
particular
facts
which
the
court
found
resulted
in
the
violation
of
wisconsin
law
would
if
also
found
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
resulted
in
a
violation
of
federal
law.
without
arguing
the
--
whether
or
not
the
record
would
sustain
such
finding
or
whether
the
board
would
make
such
finding,
although
we
believe
that
is
implicit
in
the
whole
problem.
if
these
facts
are
also
in
violation
of
the
federal
act,
then
there
would
be
no
question
of
a
conflict
of
remedies
and
that
the
superior
authority
of
the
congress
would
prevail.
the
operating
statute
in
the
federal
act
was
so
called
secondary
boycotts
statute
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
the
operating
words
are
that
it
is
an
unlawful
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
induce
the
employees
of
an
employer
to
cease
their
employment.
it
--
and
the
purpose
is
to
force
or
require
an
employer
or
other
person
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
other
person,
of
course
they're
operating
in
a
difficult
word
is
the
word
“person”,
because
we
must
conceive
that
by
definition,
neither
the
state
nor
its
political
subdivisions
are
employers
and
they
come
within
the
reach
then
of
the
secondary
boycott
provision
of
the
act
only
if
they
may
be
called
persons.
mr.
david
previant
i
believe
so.
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
implicit
in
--
in
justice
currie's
decision.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
i
--
i
did
see
that.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
believe
that
is
the
basic
inconsistency
in
mr.
justice
currie's
concurring
opinion.
he
--
he
actually
doesn't
meet
the
point.
he
does
say
directly
and
i
--
i
don't
believe
my
practical
issue
is
the
same
as
yours,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
david
previant
oh,
i
was
looking
at
the
--
mr.
david
previant
--
at
the
record
before
the
court
which
justice
currie's
opinion
starts
at
page
34.
mr.
david
previant
but
he
does
say
expressly
at
page
35
after
acknowledging
that
the
county
could
be
a
person
that
under
our
federal
system
of
government,
it
is
implied
in
the
united
states
constitution
--
mr.
david
previant
--
that
the
national
government
in
the
exercise
of
the
powers
may
not
prevent
the
state
or
any
agency
thereof
from
discharging
some
ordinary
functions
of
government.
i
think
that
both
the
presenting
opinion
and
the
concurring
opinion
demonstrate
the
fallacy
right
within
the
opinion
when
they
suggest
that
perhaps
if
this
were
a
lawful
strike,
if
these
were
lawful
activities,
there
would
be
no
problem
and
they
could
not
restrain
that
conduct
even
though
it
was
an
interference
with
an
essential
government,
but
then
they
turn
to
the
fact
that
this
is
an
unlawful
activity
under
the
state
law.
mr.
david
previant
that
so.
and
we
are
perfectly
willing
for
the
purposes
of
our
argument
to
conceive
that
national
labor
relations
board
would
similarly
hold
as
with
the
wisconsin
board,
that
this
is
in
violation
of
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
act,
now
that
the
matter
had
been
submitted
to
the
board
to
the
first
instance.
if
i
have
received
temporary
relief
in
the
federal
courts
and
also
issue
of
desist
order.
it
seems
that
the
very
obvious
and
short
answer
to
justice
currie's
position
is
that
the
entire
theory
of
preemption
is
an
interference
with
the
essential
activities
of
state
government.
that
is
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
has
delegated
to
the
congress
the
right
to
act
in
a
certain
field
and
if
it
has,
it
cannot
unlawfully
intrude
upon
the
function
of
state
government.
it
is
only
when
it
is
acting
outside
of
the
authority
which
has
conferred
upon
it
by
the
federal
constitution
that
it
had
unlawfully
intrude
upon
the
reserved
powers
of
the
state,
and
here
of
course
we
have
the
expressed
delegated
power
of
regulating
the
commerce
between
the
states.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
it
does
and
--
mr.
david
previant
there
is
no
distinction,
at
least
--
certainly
in
wisconsin
law,
there's
no
distinction.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
distinction
in
the
law
generally
on
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
only
--
well,
justice,
reiterated
some
of
those
principles
in
discussing
the
west
virginia
case,
wherein,
in
enforcing
a
tax
fee,
yes,
they
--
an
employee
of
the
state
--
the
court
held
number
one
that
of
course
the
taxing
of
an
employee
of
the
state
carries
with
it
no
unconstitutional
overtones
but
number
two,
that
even
though
in
that
part
of
the
statute,
which
permits
a
levy
against
a
person
who
is
indebted
to
the
taxpayer
who
owes
money.
the
fact
that
the
word
person
does
not
include
the
state,
did
not
preclude
the
collector
of
internal
revenue
from
attaching
wages
doing
only
from
the
auditor
of
the
state
in
that
case
to
the
--
to
the
employee.
that
was
--
that
was
the
problem
that
concerned
the
wisconsin
--
the
prevailing
opinion,
not
justice
currie,
whether
or
not
where
you
have
an
expressed
exclusion
with
respect
to
the
ordinary
employer-employee
relationship
and
no
expressed
inclusion
in
the
term
“person,”
they
could
--
they
could
reasonably
hold
as
did
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
the
third
circuit
that
the
city
or
the
county
or
the
state
was
nevertheless
a
person
within
the
reach
of
this
secondary
boycott
provision
and
hence,
a
person
who
could
seek
relief
and
a
person
who
would
--
whose
presence
in
a
dispute
of
this
kind
would
give
rise
to
jurisdiction
in
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
it's
--
it's
--
the
very
--
the
very
expression
of
what
did
the
congress
intend.
mr.
david
previant
we
--
we
believe
it
is
entirely
beside
the
point.
that's
right.
that
this
is
a
question
of
construction
and
this
court
in
construing
the
word
person
and
the
so-called
piggy-back
case,
the
railway
case,
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
that
the
railroad
company
was
a
person
within
the
reach
of
the
secondary
boycott
provision
although
excluded
from
the
definition
of
employer
in
a
definitional
section
of
a
statute.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
think
that
you're
right.
it
doesn't
follow
automatically,
but
it
seems
the
very
--
the
very
reasons
however,
which
led
this
court
to
believe
that
the
word
person
must
embrace
the
excluded
employer
on
that
case
should
also
lead
this
court
to
believe
that
that
same
term
should
embrace
the
excluded
employer
in
this
case.
now,
the
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
for
the
--
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
secondary
boycott
provision
of
the
statute,
which
talks
about
interrupting
a
contractual
relationship
or
doing
business
with
a
person,
a
county
is
a
person.
mr.
david
previant
it
--
it
neither
--
it
neither
includes
nor
it
doesn't
exclude.
mr.
david
previant
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
it
is
a
municipal
corporation.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
assume
that
it
was
a
universal
form
of
government
for
county
operation.
mr.
david
previant
but
all
the
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
are
referred
to
as
municipal
corporations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
very
pleading,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
caption,
county
of
door,
municipal
corporations,
the
county
itself,
which
has
described
itself
as
a
municipal
corporation.
in
its
bill
of
complaint,
it
describes
itself
as
a
county
of
door,
a
municipal
corporation.
mr.
david
previant
the
--
the
court
by
its
questions
has
drawn
out
virtually
the
heart
of
our
argument,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
which
it
has
discussed
the
meaning
of
the
word
“person”
as
applied
to
municipal
corporation
and
in
support
of
the
case
which
it
had
earlier
decided
and
which
the
wisconsin
board
--
court
thought
was
bad
law.
there
is
--
i
know
usually
one
goes
to
the
legislative
sources
in
all
problems
of
construction
and
the
board
referred
during
the
course
of
its
brief
to
an
effort
that
was
made
by
senator
wagner
back
in
1938
to
amend
the
definition
of
“person”
to
include
a
municipal
employer.
the
board
considered
that
is
of
legislative
history.
earlier,
when
it
said
that
the
term
was
not
embraced,
that
is
the
term
person
did
not
embrace
the
municipal
corporation
and
later,
when
it
reversed
itself
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
piggy-back
case.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
--
the
board
of
course
says
it
has
no
--
no
significance,
so
i
agree
with
the
board.
we
--
we
just
check
the
congressional
record
again
and
we
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
time
that
senator
wagner
proposed
his
amendment
that
this
was
an
act
which
defined
only
unfair
labor
practices
on
the
part
of
employers.
it
was
some
nine
years
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
made
it
a
--
by
a
par
type
act
so
to
speak,
and
at
that
time,
referring
to
the
congressional
record.
senator
wagner
was
concerned
solely
with
the
fact
that
there
are
many
municipal
corporations
or
political
subdivisions
of
a
state,
which
had
been
receiving
very
lucrative
contracts
from
the
federal
government,
but
that
they
had
been
engaging
in
unfair
labor
practices
or
what
would
have
been
unfair
labor
practices
had
they
come
within
the
definition
of
employer,
and
he
thought
that
any
person
doing
business
with
the
united
states
government
should
be
required
to
comply
with
the
laws
of
the
government
as
they
apply
to
the
private
person
doing
business,
the
individual
citizen
doing
business
with
the
government.
that
was
why
in
1938,
he
had
proposed
that
the
--
that
the
definition
of
the
word
person
be
enlarged.
well,
that
proposal
apparently
never
was
acted
upon
but
it
was
presented
in
an
entirely
different
context
and
an
entirely
different
legislative
environment
so
to
speak
than
what
we
have
today
in
determining
this
question.
i
think
one
thing
that
i
might
emphasize
at
this
point
since
the
part
of
the
legal
question
is
already
before
the
court
is
that
when
we
talk
about
public
construction,
we
are
talking
about
a
tremendous
industry
in
this
country,
and
that
when
we
talk
about
public
construction
for
a
political
subdivision,
we
are
talking
also
about
the
substantial
part
of
that
industry
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
source
authority
for
the
year
1957
that
there
is
some
$48
billion,
$48
billion
of
public
construction.
this
was
in
the
year
1957.
of
that
48
billion
--
mr.
david
previant
billion,
yes.
of
that
$48
billion
of
public
construction
in
1957,
some
14
billion
was
for
the
state
or
the
federal
government
or
its
political
subdivisions.
this
is
almost
30%
of
the
total
public
construction
in
this
country.
to
sustain
the
argument
of
the
wisconsin
court
would
mean
to
exclude
from
the
reach
of
the
act
insofar
as
interruptions
of
interstate
commerce
are
concerned.
this
substantial
portion,
this
30%
of
all
public
construction
in
--
in
this
country,
and
--
and
that,
we
believe
is
a
--
is
a
compelling
reason.
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
have
to
amend
my
statement.
i
said
$48
billion
of
public
construction.
it's
$48
billion
of
construction
of
which
$14
million
is
public.
in
other
words,
of
the
total
construction
in
this
country
of
$48
billion,
30%
falls
within
the
category
of
the
kind
of
construction
that
door
county
was
doing
and
that
--
unless
the
--
we
are
going
to
give
the
effect
to
the
legislative
purpose
and
scheme
here
as
including
the
municipal
corporation
within
the
definition
of
the
term
person
as
it
is
used
in
secondary
boycott,
we
are
going
to
take
out
of
the
protection
of
the
federal
act,
public
employers,
private
contractors
who
are
doing
business
for
public
employers,
the
employees
of
private
contractors,
because
if
wisconsin
is
right,
then
even
the
section
7
rights
of
these
employees
have
not
been
preempted
by
the
federal
act.
mr.
david
previant
no.
no,
because
in
that
instance,
united
states
government
access
an
employer.
now,
we're
not
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
yes,
and
--
and
there
had
been
cases
before
this
court.
this
question
has
never
been
raised
but
there
have
been
cases
before
this
court
involving
public
construction,
the
u.s.
army,
atomic
energy
commission's
housing
projects.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
it
does.
mr.
david
previant
no.
no,
it
includes
a
total
of
public
construction.
that's
right.
but
as
i
say,
the
public
construction
projects
upon
which
these
disputes
have
arisen
have
been
before
this
court,
but
the
question
in
this
context
has
never
been
raised.
(inaudible)
mr.
david
previant
--
was
one
of
them,
incidentally.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
would
be
the
situation,
yes.
that
--
that
usually
is
performed
by
private
contractors.
again,
the
--
the
urgency
of
the
--
of
the
matter
is
that
where
the
theory
advanced
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
control
this
kind
of
case,
we
will
have
eliminated
this
vast
amount
of
work
and
these
vast
numbers
of
employees
and
employers
engaged
in
this
type
of
work
for
the
simple
reason
that
on
a
particular
day
at
a
particular
time,
the
very
same
works
they
ordinarily
and
customarily
do
is
being
down
for
a
municipal
corporation
rather
than
for
a
private
entrepreneur.
mr.
david
previant
i
just
address
myself
to
the
whole
question
i
believe
i
have
a
minute
or
so.
mr.
david
previant
it
appear
--
appears
to
me
that
while
the
--
the
courthouse
may
have
been
completed,
the
dispute
has
not
ended.
there
is
still
a
dispute
which
we
have
been
prevented
from
pursuing
and
we
could
still
pursue
that
suit
at
the
courthouse
today,
still
protesting
the
fact
that
nonunion
work
and
nonunion
material
went
into
that
courthouse
or
if
this
gentleman
should
ever
return
to
the
courthouse
to
complete
whatever
he
may
not
have
completed
or
to
repair
whatever
he
may
have
done
poorly.
in
addition
to
the
other
points
suggested
here
is
the
bond.
there's
also
the
great
public
question
involved
in
this
kind
of
a
matter
and
i
--
i
can
recall
that
when
we
argued
the
wisconsin
public
utility
cases
here.
there
was
one
involving
the
arbitration
and
one
involving
the
strike.
this
court
held
that
the
wisconsin
law
has
been
preempted
insofar
as
the
strike
was
concerned,
even
though
that
strike
had
been
over
for
some
two
years,
it
held
that
there
was
mootness
on
the
arbitration
award
because
the
contract
term
during
which
the
arbitration
award
would
have
been
effective
had
been
expired
and
a
new
contract
had
been
negotiated.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
--
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
bond
itself
was
not
required
by
wisconsin
statute
to
remain
in
effect
pending
the
final
appeal
and
determination
of
the
matter,
but
further
that
under
wisconsin
statute,
even
though
through
carelessness
on
either
side,
the
bond
has
been
permitted
to
expire,
we
were
nevertheless
if
we
prevail
here,
be
permitted
to
--
to
tax
our
cost
and
damages
from
the
circuit
court
on
through
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
so,
that
--
that's
the
point
i'm
sure
would
never
be
moved,
and
it
also
appears
to
me
that
if
the
court
is
acting
wholly
without
jurisdiction,
as
we
believe
this
court
did,
that
there
must
be
a
way
to
get
a
pronouncement
of
this
court
that
such
holding
without
jurisdiction
action
shall
not
be
repeated
in
the
future.
otherwise,
we
would
never
get
determinations
in
this
court
on
very
vital
public
questions.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
called
a
corporation.
i
think
the
--
the
term
corporation
is
used
very
loosely
as
it
is
applied
to
any
governmental
function.
i
--
i
would
suggest
this
mr.
justice
stewart
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
municipal
corporation
that
again,
taking
the
broad
intention,
which
this
court
must
spell
out
from
the
act
of
congress,
that
the
term
"person"
would
include
a
--
an
entity
whether
it
is
a
live
or
an
artificial
entity,
whether
it
is
a
corporate
body
or
an
unincorporated
body.
it
might
be
an
association,
maybe
--
maybe
an
unincorporated
state
is
an
association
of
citizens,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
touchstone
is
not
whether
we
come
within
the
literal
language
because
obviously,
they
don't
even
refer
to
municipal
corporations
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
david
previant
--
language.
it
becomes
a
problem
of
construction
and
this
court
has
never
hesitated
to
put
municipal
corporations,
states,
federal
agencies
within
the
meaning
of
a
term
“person”
as
used
in
many
other
laws.
mr.
david
previant
and
certainly
every
reason
would
suggest
that
it
should
not
hesitate
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
and
--
and
on
reconsidering
the
policy
questions
which
had
led
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
david
previant
well,
the
--
the
board
did
exactly
what
--
mr.
david
previant
--
this
court
did.
the
--
the
board
said,
“although
a
railroad
is
--
is,”
--
the
court
said,
“although
the
railroad
is
not
within
the
definition
of
an
employer,
obviously,
congress
didn't
want
the
secondary
boycotts
running
rampant
throughout
our
economy.”
and
--
and
the
board
said
that
reasoning
makes
a
lot
more
sense
than
our
original
reasoning
when
we
said
if
we
can't
control
the
unfair
labor
practice
which
the
municipality
might
commit
against
its
employees,
then
we
shouldn't
control
the
secondary
boycott
when
somebody
commit
against
the
municipality.
the
board
originally
thought
it
was
balancing
the
convenience
and
the
equities.
after
this
court's
decision,
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
sound
reason
to
balance
those
equities
in
the
railway
labor
case,
it
decided
there
was
no
sound
reason
to
do
so
in
the
municipal
case
and
i
think
correctly.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
we
--
i
think
we
would
have
to
check
that.
i
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
i'm
sure
that
we
can
make
that
available
to
the
court.
mr.
david
previant
we
surely
will.
mr.
david
previant
might
be
with
the
chief
justice
permission
make
further
comment
on
other
aspects
of
the
question
of
mootness
--
mr.
david
previant
--
only.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
--
i
think
possibly
at
that
point,
that's
true,
but
--
mr.
david
previant
in
the
event,
it
was
improvidently
granted,
that's
right,
but
i
--
i
would
hesitate
to
make
an
affirmative
or
answer
or
denial
until
i've
had
a
chance
to
check
it.
i
would
say
in
either
event,
if
we
are
talking
now
about
what
the
bond
is
supposed
to
do,
the
--
the
county
of
door
is
a
very
responsible
litigant
in
this
case,
and
if
we
are
entitled
to
collect
damages
for
what
the
county
of
door
has
put
us
through
from
the
circuit
court
on
through
this
court,
then
certainly,
this
case
should
not
be
mooted.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
--
i
think
the
bond
is
merely
a
device
of
securing
the
liability.
i
think
whether
the
bond
is
posting
--
whether
it's
posting
sufficient
quantity,
it
makes
no
difference.
if
--
if
they
were
not
entitled
to
prevail
in
the
cost,
we
are
entitled
to
collect
our
cost
in
damages.
mr.
david
previant
thank
you.
mr.
david
previant
thank
you.
