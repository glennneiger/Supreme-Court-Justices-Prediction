justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
previant,
may
i
ask
whether
one
is
to
infer
from
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
currie
that
if
the
county
were
out
of
the
case,
if
this
--
or
merely
private
employer
and
the
union
that
--
that
the
court,
your
court,
would
have
found
preemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
so
true
but
at
the
core
of
your
statement
a
little
while
ago,
the
opinion
indicate
that
constitutionally
they
couldn't
preempt
in
the
case
of
a
county,
i
did
--
can
you
correct
the
statement,
is
there
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
what
the
sentence
on
page
24
mean,
the
proposing
of
the
open
paragraph,
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
problem
if
congress
have
legislated
that
all
peaceful
picket
--
picketing
of
an
employer
would
engage
in
a
business
affecting
interstate
commerce
is
a
valid
activity,
not
subject
to
being
enjoined
by
any
thought
if
the
--
if
the
activity
is
of
a
nature
to
call
for
preemption
of
state
law
then
one
has
that
situation
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
reading
from
your
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
reading
from
the
print
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
he
does
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
don't
know
whether
it's
one
or
the
other
until
the
national
labor
board
decides
subject
to
court
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
whether
--
can
you
tell
me
whether
sovereign
immunity
so-called
applies
to
municipality?
i
suppose
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
currie
said
state
or
agency.
i
don't
think
sovereign
immunity
governs
--
preclude
suits
against
cities,
what
about
against
county?
can
the
case
make
a
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong?
your
chief
justice's
opinion
doesn't
indicate
that
this
raises
a
constitutional
question,
justice
currie
give
some
information
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
the
sole
question
is,
is
it
not
when
the
construction
of
the
word
"person"
and
its
adaptability
or
allocation
to
include
a
county
of
--
a
county
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
to
it.
i
don't
mean
that's
all
there
is,
but
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
this
is
a
violation
of
your
state
law
or
the
federal
law
is
beside
the
point,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
necessarily
control
a
construction
and
application
of
the
word
person,
not
to
exclude
the
railroad
that
that
word
also
does
not
include
a
state
or
any
branches
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
billion
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right,
all
construction
work
by
the
united
states
government
directly
of
it,
is
it?a
person
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
as
an
employer,
if
public
construction
done
by
outside
contractors
for
uncle
sam
would
be
covered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
previant,
most
public
construction
is
at
least
in
part
and
in
good
part
performed
by
--
is
--
is
accomplished
throughout
the
employers
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
men
lost
their
job?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
closed
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
courthouse
is
functioning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
contractor
may
be,
god
knows
on
what
other
job?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
what?
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
--
for
what
--
what's
the
bond?secure
cost
on
appeal
or
what,
or
damages
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
damages
to
the
improper
issue
of
the
bond?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
cover
the
--
the
course
of
litigation
through
whatever
courts
it
may
go
including
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
specifically
to
pursue
justice
black's
question.should
the
county
lose
in
this
court
assuming
the
litigation
that
relied
that
could
go
on
or
rather
if
we
cut
that
out
because
if
it's
allowed,
it
will
not
depend
on
my
question,
would
you
say
the
counsel
for
the
county
that
is
the
petitioner
should
succeed
in
this
court
and
therefore,
the
judgment
of
your
supreme
court
would
set
aside
that
it
could
on
the
basis
--
it
could
invoke
the
bond
to
get
the
course
of
having
gone
to
the
supreme
--
having
had
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
and
then
having
been
allowed
to
come
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
--
therefore,
the
money
value
of
what
is
involved
is
still
alive
although
everything
else
is
closed
up
at
the
courthouse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
this
is
really
a
suit
of
taking
$123,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
if
there
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
previant,
before
you
sit
down.
i
should
like
to
revert
to
the
moot
problem.
seeing
for
myself
(inaudible)
to
whom
i
can
speak,
you
have
to
satisfy
me
on
the
bond
and
on
no
other
grounds
to
satisfy
me
that
this
case
is
not
moot
and
i
refer
you
to
barker
painting
company
against
local
number
734,
281
u.s.462.
and
if
i
want
to
pursue
a
little
bit
more,
the
bond
question.
will
this
bond
go
to
the
temporary
and
the
permanent
injunction?
i
suppose
the
best
way
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
best
--
one
of
the
best
ways
in
my
difficulty
is
to
really
get
the
bond
or
bond
or
bond.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you'll
be
good
enough
to
look
at
281
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
with
chief
justice's
permission
make
such
comments
as
you
wish
to
as
to
controlling
relevance
of
that
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
yes.
