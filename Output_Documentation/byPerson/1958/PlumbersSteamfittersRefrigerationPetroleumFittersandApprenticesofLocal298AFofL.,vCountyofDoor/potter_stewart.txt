this
--
this
case
was
in
the
so-called
no
man's
land
because
of
the
amount
of
money
involved
did
not
meet
the
minimum

justice

stewart
--
jurisdictional
requirements
self-imposed
by
the
board,
is
that
it?
justice

stewart
and
your
suggestion
is
that
a
great
deal
of
this
30%
of
$48
billion,
whatever
that
is,
$15
billion
would
actually
be
in

below
the

in
answer
to
your
question
addressed

not

not
an
exclusive
definition.

section
2
(1)
(2)
of
the
act
quoted
on
page
23
of
your
appendix.
you
--
you
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
in
wisconsin
at
least,
a
county
is
a
municipal
corporation,
but
i
suppose
a
state
is
not
a
corporation,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
true
though,
isn't
it,
that
the
--
up
until
this
court's
decision
in
local
25,
the
national
labor
board
had
view
opposite
to
the
position
that

opinion.
justice

now,
there
of
course,
verbally,
there
was
no
difficulty
at
all
in

in
holding
that
a
railroad,
which
is
quite
obviously
a
corporation,
was
in
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
definition
of
person.
was
that
relied
on
in
the
opinion?
i
don't
know.
i
