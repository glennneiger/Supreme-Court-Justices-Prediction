mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
petitioner
is
a
motor
carrier
holding
operating
authority
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
conducts
operations
of
principally
between
defined
areas
in
the
states
of
virginia
and
west
virginia.
the
state
corporation
commission
instituted
proceedings
against
petitioner
which
led
to
fines
totalling
of
$5000
for
transporting
shipments
between
two
points
in
virginia
through
bluefield,
west
virginia
in
accordance
with
its
interstate
certificate
as
construed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
there
were
a
total
of
17
counts
specified
in
the
rule
to
show
cause
before
the
state
corporation
commission.
and
at
the
hearing,
in
the
submission
of
briefs
there,
they
convicted
on
a
total
of
the
seven
counts
omitting
three
that
the
government
later
confessed
thereon.
so
to
summarize
on
that
points
--
on
that
point,
your
honors,
there
were
10
counts
involving
shipments
moving
from
one
point
in
virginia
to
a
second
point
in
virginia
where
the
state
authority
has
conceded
that
the
operations
were
interstate
in
character.
now,
i
believe
that
if
i
can
make
reference
to
a
map
that
i
have
here
behind
me.
i
may
more
quickly
inform
the
court
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
growth
or
development
of
these
interstate
certificates
and
i
earnestly
state
that
an
understanding
of
these
facts,
i
believe,
will
make
it
easy
for
the
court
to
decide
the
question
of
law
that's
involved.
here
is
southwestern
virginia.above
the
black
line
is
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
over
here
to
the
west
or
left
is
a
portion
of
kentucky.
soon
after
the
enactment
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
a
petitioner
qualified
as
a
grandfather
operator
and
was
issued
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
which
generally
describe
and
as
is
depicted
here,
permits
operations
between
bluefield,
west
virginia
and
points
within
five
miles
thereof,
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
points
in
southwestern
virginia
and
described
by
this
blue
line
and
points
in
west
virginia.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
by
maintenance
is
5000
--
about
40
miles.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
your
honor,
from
old
bluefield
to
roanoke
is
about
54
miles.
this
--
this
would
be
about
54
miles,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
this
first
certificate
of
petitioner,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
consistently
held
that
a
--
the
radial
authority
of
this
truck
authorizes
the
whole
of
thereof
to
conduct
operations
between
the
radial
base
which
would
be
the
bluefield
area
here
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
any
or
all
points
described
in
the
outlying
territory.
that
is,
that
it
could
pick
up
a
shipment
at
roanoke
and
deliver
it
in
bluefield
or
pick
up
a
shipment
in
bluefield
west
virginia
and
deliver
it
in
bristol
or
whitfield
or
charleston,
west
virginia.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
it
could
not,
sir.
later,
i
believe
in
1943
service
storage
through
a
section
5
application
asking
interstate
commerce
commission
to
be
permitted
to
acquire
the
authority
previously
issued
to
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
and
he
was
the
holder
of
authority
described
here
in
yellow
that
is
between
bluefield,
west
virginia
enforced
within
five
miles
thereof
and
on
--
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
points
in
within
75
miles
of
this
base
area
in
virginia
and
west
virginia.
now,
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
216
(a)
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
prior
to
the
time
that
these
two
individual
carriers
were
merged
in
one
carrier,
they
were
permitted
to
interchange
or
interline
the
track
just
as
railroads
and
for
the
regulated
carriers
are
permitted.
for
example,
a
shipment
could
be
picked
up
at
roanoke
on
the
yellow
certificate
brought
to
the
radial
base
which
is
the
point
in
common
to
both
certificates
and
then
delimit,
so
to
speak,
on
the
blue
certificate
or
pick
up
at
roanoke
brought
to
bluefield,
west
virginia
and
deliver
it
at
charleston,
west
virginia.
now,
getting
to
the
actual
operations
that
were
involved
in
this
controversy,
i
have
drawn
in
an
attempt
at
simplification
of
the
whole
problem,
some
of
the
halving
of
operations
that
have
been
conducted
historically
since
the
certificates
were
merged
but
certainly
as
the
record
discloses
for
a
period
of
more
than
four
years.
they
had
the
--
a
collection
of
ltl
shipments
as
they
say
in
the
trade,
less-truckloads,
small
shipments
averaging,
in
my
case
i
believe,
approximately
400
pounds.
they
would
be
consolidated
at
a
terminal
location
at
roanoke,
virginia
and
move
in
line
haul
service
or
over
the
road
service
to
the
base
territory
bluefield,
west
virginia
where
the
carrier
has
its
principal
terminal
and
some
74
odd
units
of
equipment.
they
also
had
operations
coming
down
from
charleston,
west
virginia
into
this
area.
coming
up
from
bristol,
virginia
into
this
area
moving
through
the
same
terminal
so
the
result
of
it
would
be,
you'd
probably
have
20
shipments
on
a
vehicle,
moving
from
roanoke
to
bluefield,
17
of
them
going
on
to
destinations
in
west
virginia,
and
the
remaining
three
going
on
to
various
points
down
on
southwestern
virginia.
it
was
stipulated
on
the
record,
there's
no
dispute
about
this
fact.
and
that
is
that
all
operations.
all
questioned
shipments
physically
moved
from
a
point
in
virginia
out-of-state
through
the
bluefield,
west
virginia
terminal.
so,
we
have
no
problem
of
them
--
in
some
cases
where
a
carrier
short
--
shortcut
its
radial
base
or
its
so-called
gateway
point.
now,
the
state
of
virginia's
evidence
in
this
case
consist
almost
exclusively
apart
from
the
conceded
facts
that
we
were
doing
this,
of
a
map,
an
official
map
of
virginia.
and
they
take
the
position
that
operations
conducted
between
roanoke
and
whitfield,
since
they
have
a
percentage
of
security
greater
than
the
most
direct
highway
through
were
illogical,
none
direct
and
the
abnormal
routes
of
movement.
unfortunately,
by
using
a
map
and
picturing
oneself
as
driving
a
car
instead
of
working
at
--
worked
through
the
transportation
experts
(inaudible)
it
is
--
we
are
easily
mislead
by
the
security
problem
raised
by
the
state
of
virginia.
they
contend
that
since
there
is
certain
securities
in
certain
of
these
operations
that
the
operations
are
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
state
regulatory
process.
we
introduce
evidence
in
this
proceeding
demonstrating
that
the
operations
conducted
again,
i
take
my
example
as
roanoke
because
it's
the
only
large
city
in
the
area
and
it
generates
the
most
traffic.
from
roanoke
to
white
sulphur,
from
roanoke
to
bacliff,
from
roanoke
to
charleston
all
of
these
operations,
your
honors,
are
securities.
so
also
is
the
one
that
--
one
of
those
seven
to
whitfield.
it
is
securities
for
mileage
and
some
cases
is
but
twice
as
great
as
great
as
the
direct
route.
the
reason
why
there
was
twice
as
great
as
the
direct
route
in
transportation
handling
is
that
in
order
to
effectively
transport
a
lot
of
traffic
and
conducting
operations
profitably,
you
must
have
a
flow
of
freight
as
the
only
qualified
express
transportation
witness
stated
in
this
proceeding.
he
stated
that
because
the
flow
of
freight
--
freight
was
moving
towards
bluefield
he
could
handle
shipments
down
in
whitfield
economically
by
moving
them
first
into
bluefield
and
then
later
consolidating
with
shipments
coming
in
from
the
north
out-of-state
points
such
as
charleston,
west
virginia.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
nothing,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
that
is
the
only
evidence,
your
honor,
that
they
did
--
response
of
two
witnesses
who
had
made
the
investigations
which
we
admitted
that
we
did
handle
traffic
for
example
from
roanoke
to
whitfield.
it
was
established,
it
was
conceded
almost
stipulated
that
these
operations
were
performed.
we
admitted
it.
in
fact
we
granted
several
more.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
whitfield,
sir.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
that's
right.
may
i
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
in
some
cases
yes,
your
honor,
in
another
cases
no.
now,
for
example
on
whitfield,
whitfield
is
either
on
u.s.
highway
11
or
very
close
to
it.
if
u.s.
highway
11
extends
down
at
shenandoah
valley
through
roanoke
towards
bristol
and
it
either
passes
directly
through
whitfield
or
close
to
it.
so
if
the
most
direct
highway
route
would
be
u.s.
highway
11,
but
if
you
only
have
400
pounds
shipment
sent
you
don't
have
to
go
that
way
i'm
not
talking
of
this.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
they
did
not.
we
were
the
ones
that
that
produced
the
evidence
with
respect
to
operations
for
example
between
roanoke
and
white
sulphur.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
only
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
that
are
clearly
interstate
movements
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
--
were
handled
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
the
movements
moving
between
virginia
points.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
not
under
the
--
the
decisions
of
this
court.
no.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
well,
it
maybe
implied,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
only
question
is
whether
--
the
first
question
is
whether
or
not
the
interstate
commerce
commission
with
respect
to
this
particular
certificate
and
this
particular
operator
had
occupied
the
field
by
having
issued
him
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
their
evidence
consisted
of
the
presentation
of
two
witnesses
stating
that
they
had
intercepted
that
these
vehicles
on
virginia
highways
moving
traffic
from
such
points
as
roanoke
to
whitfield
or
bristol,
chicago
and
in
addition
to
that
they
presented
the
state
--
the
official
state
highway
map
and
that
is
all.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
oh,
that's
true.
we
conceded
that,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
your
honor,
the
whole
proceeding
was
concluded
in
a
day.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
if
i
sponsor
the
general
manager
of
the
company
put
an
evidence
to
show
that
traffic
moving
between
virginia
points
through
bluefield
consisted
or
three
percent
of
the
total
of
the
traffic
handled
by
the
company
that
it
was
a
distribution
carrier
serving
rural
areas
certainly
that
the
operations
performed
in
virginia
were
precisely
of
the
same
character
as
those
performed
between
virginia
and
west
virginia.
i
also
sponsored
a
two-shipper
witnesses
stating
in
effect
that
they
knew
when
the
shipment
was
picked
up
at
a
virginia
origin
that
it
was
going
to
be
routed
through
bluefield
and
finally
delivered
in
virginia.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no.
your
honor.
in
this
case,
for
example,
counsel
for
the
government
down
there
stipulated
that
in
those
cases
the
rates
were
--
were
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
--
the
same.
there
was
no
--
no
question
on
the
rate.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
that's
right.
well,
one
the
--
one
of
the
shipper
witnesses
did
imply
that
he
was
willing
to
pay
a
higher
rate,
so
apparently
on
some
of
his
traffic
there
was
a
higher
rate
charge
because
of
--
it
moved
through
a
route
in
west
virginia.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
oh,
yes
sir.
i
put
in
the
certificate
in
a
series
of
exhibits
that
are
all
in
the
record.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
this
was
held
before
the
state
corporation
commission
of
virginia
which
i
understand
is
--
or
has
the
position
of
a
court
of
record
down
there.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
it
was
a
criminal
proceeding,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
they
have
--
three
main
commissions
sat
on
this
particular
case
and
they
have
powers
quite
similar
to
what
judges
would
have
in
--
in
other
states
that
they
have
almost
the
unique
status
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no
jury.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
well,
i
tried
to
persuade
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
that
they
had
to
run,
at
least
have
evidence
and
they
didn't
accept
it.
i
took
this
whole
matter
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
and
they
just
confirmed
it.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
i
suppose
that
could
have
made
it.
i
don't
know
the
--
i'm
not
a
virginia
practitioner.
i
was
there
by
leave
by
--
and
i
have
to
confess
i
don't
know,
but
i
assume
that
could
be.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
i
did
not.
i
was
afraid
to.
in
any
event
at
the
close
of
the
state
corporation
commission
proceeding,
i
have
to
try
to
inform
them
concerning
what
i
believe
to
be
lower
--
it
was
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
a
number
of
cases
and
including
atlantic
freight
lines
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
also
informal
memorandum
from
the
staff
officials
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
i
was
persuaded
that
the
commission
was
not
going
to
accept
those
statements
from
the
interstate
commission,
i
filed
a
petition
for
declaratory
order
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
asking
it
to
construe
our
certificate.
a
copy
of
that
petition
was
filed
appropriately
on
the
state
officials.
and
thereafter,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
issued
an
order
stating
that
their
interpretation
of
the
certificate
is
just
as
i
have
outlined.
that
we
could
handle
traffic
between
points
in
virginia
so
long
as
we
observe
the
gateway
point.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
sir.
now,
the
state
relies
on
eichholz
versus
missouri,
a
position
in
306
u.s.
268.
that
case
involved
that
on
operated
transporting
traffic
by
motor
carrier
act
from
st.
louis,
missouri
to
kansas
city,
missouri
through
kansas
city,
kansas.
he
was
not
at
the
time
that
apprehended
by
the
state
officials
of
missouri,
he
was
not
the
holder
of
an
interstate
commerce
commission
certificate.
and
all
the
--
although
the
court
recognized
that
the
commission
under
the
federal
motor
carrier
act
which
had
just
here
before
them
passed,
might
authorize
such
a
movement
in
this
particular
case
that
it
had
not
yet
been
authorized
and
no
jurisdiction
had
yet
vested
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
control
the
operations.
and
accordingly
this
court
held
or
sustained
the
holding
of
the
missouri
authorities
to
the
effect
that
this
was
a
subterfuge
to
avoid
or
evade
state
regulation.
now,
the
--
the
difference
in
eichholz
are
on
the
facts
wholly
beyond
the
--
the
question
of
eichholz
not
being
(inaudible)
holder
are
this.
eichholz
was
handling
the
traffic
at
two-thirds
of
the
rate
that
was
prevailing
generally
within
the
state
of
missouri
at
that
time.
he
converted
the
traffic
to
interstate
traffic
only
for
the
purpose
of
making
available
two
shippers
a
low
--
a
rate
of
66
cents
a
hundred
with
a
prevailing
rate
was
something
like
98
cents
a
hundred.
he
consistently
handled
what
we
call
volume
traffic
or
truckload
traffic,
contrary
to
the
type
of
traffic
that
we're
handling
here
lgl
distribution
traffic
to
a
--
rural
area.
he
heavily
solicit
this
traffic
whereas
here
there
was
no
showing
of
any
vigorous
solicitation
for
this
traffic
only
that
it
was
in
interstate
commerce
pursuant
to
interstate
rates,
pursuant
to
interstate
insurance
and
all
the
tariffs
were
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
we
distributed
those
generally
through
the
terminals
in
the
area
and
it
makes
the
case
different
on
the
facts
as
well
as
on
the
law
from
eichholz.
we
rely
wholly
on
atlantic
freight
lines
petition
for
declaratory
order
and
our
own
declaratory
order.
the
best
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
in
other
words,
there
is
some
vague
record
references
to
it,
your
honor,
but
so
vague
that
it's
undependable.
i
believe
that
the
rates
were
about
the
same.
at
least
counsel
for
virginia
stated
that
and
i
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
about
the
same.yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
your
honor,
the
--
the
record
is
wholly
bound
on
--
on
the
existence
of
interstate
carriers.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
your
honor,
i
know
of
one
carrier
that
can't
serve
some
of
the
points.
i
know
this
out
of
my
own
knowledge
of
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
--
the
--
of
the
game,
but
there
was
no
record
evidence
on
it
but
the
holding
of
was,
i
don't
know,
what
the
service
facts
is
what
i
don't
know
either.
now,
in
the
precedent
which
we
rely
on
presently,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
case
involving
atlantic
freight
lines
51
m.c.c.
175,
atlantic
freight
lines
was
a
carrier
and
authorized
to
conduct
operations
between
pittsburgh
all
over
maryland,
philadelphia
and
points
in
the
upper
east
including
new
york
city.
it
conducted
operations
in
the
transportation
of
sugar
from
philadelphia
to
mckeesport
which
is
a
point
adjoining
pittsburgh.
the
pennsylvania
authorities
prosecuted
or
proceeded
otherwise
simply
i
believe
against
them.
and
ultimately
prohibited
them
from
further
transporting
traffic
between
two
pennsylvania
points
when
they
were
going
out-of-state
over
this
--
over
to
secure
this
route
through
baltimore
and
maryland.
after
the
--
the
approval
of
puc's
order
in
pennsylvania
that
case
came
up
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
denied.
the
carrier
then
went
to
interstate
commerce
commission
under
section
5
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
asked
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
construe
its
certificate.
the
puc
or
--
or
public
utilities
commission
of
pennsylvania
intervened.
they
became
a
party
to
that
proceeding
and
ultimately
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said,
“we
have
issued
a
certificate
here,
both
points
were
on
the
routes
involved
even
though
it
goes
through
baltimore.
we
have
authorized
it,
is
bona
fide,
that
certificate
is
a
final
order
and
cannot
be
attacked
collaterally
in
a
state
court.”
and,
subsequent
thereto,
the
public
utilities
commission
and
the
atlantic
freight
lines
in
and
then
there
were
a
consent
decree
which
i
have
made
an
appendix
to
by
in
my
reply
brief.
the
situation
of
pennsylvania
at
least
with
regard
to
that
carrier
has
been
clarified.
and
i
think
that
it's
very
strong
precedent
that
the
--
the
order
and
the
report
sustaining
the
order
by
the
commission
is
persuasive
on
every
point
and
it
does
consider
this
court's
opinion
and
decision
in
my
calls
a
case
that
became
a
--
came
on
10
years
before.
now,
in
addition
to
the
criticism
that
we
may
have
of
the
decisions
of
the
virginia
authorities,
we'd
like
to
raise
the
point
developed
in
castle
versus
hayes
freight
lines.
the
interstate
commerce
act
has,
as
you
know,
section
204
(c)
which
permits
state
or
any
interested
party
to
complain
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
if
the
state
feels
that
an
interstate
operator
is
conducting
operations
in
violation
of
its
interstate
certificate.
i
think
the
strong
suggestion
if
not
actual
statement
in
the
hayes
case
is
to
this
effect.
now,
whether
is
a
genuine
problem,
a
dispute
between
carrier
and
state
and
it
appears
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
finally
jurisdiction,
instead
of
taking
up
the
matter
in
their
own
forums,
the
state
should
first
resort
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
on
the
state's
reply
brief
they
have
suggested
that
there
are
so
--
certain
local
aspects
in
this
case
and
that
accordingly
that
the
order
be
given
jurisdiction
because
of
the
local
aspects.
the
local
aspects
--
your
honors,
in
this
case
are
no
more
local
and
operations
between
philadelphia
and
points
of
new
jersey,
new
york
and
new
haven
they're
90
miles
apart.
some
of
these
points
in
--
in
virginia
are
as
many
as
150
miles
apart.
but
on
the
law
i
believe
the
--
the
cases
that
i've
cited
on
my
reply
trial
brief,
capital
transit
cases
where
you
held
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
great
jurisdiction
over
the
--
over
capital
transit
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
leave
or
that
carrier
didn't
leave
the
district
of
columbia,
fully
disposed
of
the
local
aspects,
contention
of
the
state
in
amicus
curiae.
they
cite
in
support
to
their
contention
the
panhandle
case
and
the
connecticut
light
and
power
case.
both
of
these
same
cases
were
cited
by
the
same
parties
to
this
court
in
the
capital
transit
cases
and
no
--
no
reference
is
made
to
those
authorities
cited
by
the
state
of
virginia
in
your
decision
or
in
your
disposition
of
the
capital
transit
cases.
moreover,
and
finally
on
the
issue
of
local
aspects,
protection
of
local
carriers.
let's
assume
that
there
are
so.
i
know
of
one
that
served
at
some
point.
but
let's
assume
that
there
are
some
carriers.these
carriers
are
assumedly,
would
have
the
most
direct
routes.
they
would
be
able
to
operate
more
quickly,
assumedly,
or
at
least
that's
what
the
state
asks
this
court
to
accept.
assumedly,
they
can
operate
on
--
under
lower
rates
because
their
--
their
cost
would
be
lower.
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
could
capture
all
of
these
traffic
which
amounts
to
about
$500
per
week
without
difficulty.
having
the
direct
routes,
i
see
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
capture
it.
but
congress
must
have
recognized
in
defining
interstate
commerce
as
it
did
in
section
203
for
intent
of
the
act
that
there
would
be
some
effect
on
state
operators.
and
accordingly,
i
believe
that
they
enacted
206
or
the
second
proviso
of
206
(a).
that
proviso
permits
any
virginia
intrastate
operator
holding
a
certificate
issued
by
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission,
to
mail
that
certificate
to
washington
with
an
appropriate
application
form,
identify
itself,
to
publish
tariffs
and
it
automatically
is
entitled
to
an
interstate
authority,
coextensive
with
its
intrastate
authority.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
it's
in
this
--
i
believe
it's
on
the
very
last
page
of
my
reply
brief.
it's
the
second
proviso
of
section
206
(a)
of
the
act.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
the
text
is
not
in
there,
your
--
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
your
honor.
i've
--
i
--
that's
my
position.
this
interstate
commerce
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
and
its
in
interstate
commerce
is
a
matter
of
law.
that's
my
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
it
could
have
if
congress
had
withheld
its
hand.
we
might
have
got
back
to
a
--
a
situation
something
like
buck
versus
--
buck
versus
kuykendall
where
with
the
proper
arrangements,
the
--
the
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
eichholz.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
well,
i've
cited
that
on
my
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
to
me
your
honor
if
i'm
not
interrupting.
the
--
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
hadn't
been
had
in
eichholz.
it
has
been
had
here.
there's
a
final
order,
there's
a
judgment
in
this
case.
our
certificate
is
a
judgment.
this
court
had
said
so
in
the
seatrain
case.
it
has
the
same
effect
of
--
as
a
judgment.
it's
the
final
order
of
proceedings
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it's
can't
be
attacked.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
your
honor.
it
--
it
only
deals
in
a
--
in
a
general
sense
and
by
construction
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they're
--
they're
the
office
of
the
order
and
they
say
that
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
not
--
not
by
reading
the
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
--
certificate
alone,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
only
with
the
guides
and
standards
that
have
been
established
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
last
20
years
so,
since
1935
construing
their
own
certificates
and
they
have
been
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
because
i
think
it's
a
collateral
attack
on
a
valid
and
subsisting
order
defined
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
well,
there
were
--
your
honor
--
your
honor
taken
together
that
the
declaratory
report
of
the
commission
plus
the
certificate.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
they
did
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
in
the
--
in
the
declaratory
report
issued
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
the
state
corporation
commission
act
and
i
believe
around
the
1st
of
february
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
acted
about
a
month
later.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
well
it
was
by
the
precedent
established
in
atlantic
freight
lines
plus
the
order
that
we
had
issuing
us
the
certificate.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
there
is
ever
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
this
certificate
was
issued
in
1943.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
no,
your
honor.
but
may
i
explain
my
--
my
feeling
on
my
thought
on
that.
the
certificate
was
an
order.
it
didn't
have
all
the
detail
in
it.
however,
the
one
who
was
best
qualified
to
determine
what
the
order
meant
was
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that
was
held
in
atlantic
transit
lines
which
is
cited
in
atlantic
freight
lines.
that
the
--
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
said
and
i
think
this
court
has
approved
the
atlantic
freight
lines
case
cited
in
the
51
m.c.c.
to
the
effect
that
when
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders,
issues
a
certificate
it
is
the
best
interpreter
of
that
certificate
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
well,
that
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
may
i
please
use
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
yes,
your
honor.
i
may
--
i
may
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
--
i
made
for
rebuttal
for
that
argument
--
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
--
argument
tomorrow.
mr.
francis
w.
mcinerny
i
will
(inaudible)
them
tomorrow
if
i'm
going
away.
