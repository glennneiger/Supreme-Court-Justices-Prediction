justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
--
do
you
say
it
was
not
used
as
a
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
basic
(inaudible)
merely
to
the
fact
that
he
does
not
have
another
certificate
before
it's
in
--
to
use
the
circuitous
routes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
know
but
isn't
--
isn't
the
evidence
that
he
did
not
--
that
he
used
the
securities
route
because
he
didn't
have
another
certificate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
say
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
did
it
,
it
just
shows
how
the
certificate
was
granted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
is
true,
i
--
i
don't
quite
get
(inaudible),
you
say
they
do
that,
so
that's
the
only
way
they
can
legally
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
can
legally
go
that
way,
why
can
they
legally
go
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
if
--
if
the
government
certificate
made
it
impossible
for
them
legally
go
there,
what
right
does
anybody
will
do
something
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
if
the
--
if
the
commission
wants
to
give
them
the
certificates
to
go
that
circuitous
route,
then
it's
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
really
couldn't
anything
to
go
on
because
it
is
circuitous.
