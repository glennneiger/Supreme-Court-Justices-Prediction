may
i
ask

were
the

the
direct
roads
equally
favorable
to
truck
traffic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
the
proceeding
started
by
the
virginia
authorities
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
criminal
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
what
the
cause
of
the
litigation
was,(a)
what
did
the
state
prove
before
it
rested?
they
had
the
burden,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
did
--
what
was
their
case
before
you
were
called
upon
to
decide
whether
to
stand
pat
or
put
in
evidence
of
your
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
they
said
you
had
no
certificate
from
their
local
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
--
that's
all.
that
--
that
took
a
day
or
less
than
a

justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
did
you
do?
what
was
your
case
after
the
state
commonwealth
wealth
rested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
--
would
the
rate
for
the
shippers
be
different
if
you
had
routed
directly?
justice

the
same.

the

is
it
not?
justice

where
is
that
provision,
if
you
have
to
read
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
text
--
we
haven't
read
the
text.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
deny
that
this
is
interstate
commerce,
do
you?
i'm
not
talking
about,
is
it
within
the
act.
you
do
not
deny
this
is
interstate
commerce
in
this
case.
that
is,
it
isn't
governed
by
federal
legislation.
congress
is
asking,
we
just
bring
it
within
the
federal
issues.
do
you
deny
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
do
you
say
that
--
that
is
--
so,
into
interstate
commerce
that
it
couldn't
be
left
to
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
eichholz.
it
is
conceded
in
eichholz
or
in
hanley
or
eichholz.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
never
recite
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
did
it
for
the
interstate
commerce
and
yet,
would
be
left
to
the
state
because
it
was
that
case,
it's
legally
acceptable
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
interstate
--
does
the
--
does
the
certificate
which
you
have
explicitly
deal
with
this
very
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
certificate
from
the
commission,
preclude
your
doing
the
kind
of
thing
that
in
eichholz
allows
the
state
officer
there.
if
i
read
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
would
i
get
an
answer
to
an
eichholz
property
from
your
certificates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well
usually
use
whatever.
what
if.
when
you
say
it's
a
judgment
usually
i
can
find
out
what
the
court
has
decided
by
reading
the
judgment
but
i
can't
the
answer
to
this
question
by
reading
the
certificate,
can
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
state
--
if
the
state
could
prove,
could
prove
the
substance
if
they
can,
but
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
or
not.
would
there
be
anything
in
that
--
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission
either
promulgated
or
said
that
it's
foreclosed
that
determination
on
the
same
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
told
me
that
the
order
would
give
me
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
discussed
the
questions
whether
routing
by
way
subterfuge
under
the
route
which
is
authorized
would
be
covered
by
a
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
was
that?
what's
the
date
of
that
in
relation
to
what
you
say
is
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
it
couldn't
have
been
thought
then
--
then
the
--
what
the
commission
did
wasn't
foreclosed
by
what
--
what
virginia
did
wasn't'
foreclosed
by
what
--
what
the
commission
prior
thereto
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
depends
on
what
the
facts
were
that
we're
advocating
by
the
state
tribunal
and
what
the
commission
did
is
declaratory
order,
declaratory
pronouncement
was
labeled
so
one
can
judge
utilizing
that
those
are
judgments
by
virginia
it
was
finding
on
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
certificate
did
not
preclude
the
determination
by
the
virginia
authority
that
in
fact
we
use
the
certificate
as
a
substitute
for
state
practice
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
an
interpreter
of
facts
de
jure
and
i
do
not
see
that
that
certificate
will
preclude
the
state
from
fully
to
preclude
that
under
a
guise
of
an
interstate
commerce
certificate,
you
are
in
fact
engaged
in
intrastate
business
in
utilizing
the
certificate
to
escape
the
responsibility
that
they've
assigned.
that
certificate
wouldn't
do,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
case
in
this
--
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong
on
very
hand
but
the
certificate
doesn't
establish
a
substitute
in
use
of
the
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
on
the
theory
that
merely
because
traffic
originated
in
virginia
and
came
back
to
virginia
makes
it
local
in
commerce?
is
that
the
position
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
which
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
sir.
the
--
the
i.c.c.
certificate
authorizes
transportation
between
points
and
certain
points
on
routes
but
not
route,
if
i
may
explain
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
your
honor
i
can.
it
is
set
out
in
the
record
if
you
have
the
transcript
of
the
record
there.
you
will
find
it
set
out
on
page
90
at
the
top
of
the
page.
this
is
quoted
from
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
kennon
whittle,
it
is
there
and
it
is
also
at
various
places
in
the
record
and
in
the
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
it
is
a
little
bit
more
specific
mr.
mcilwaine,
because
it
says
that
part
of
the
virginia
west
of
the
u.s.
highway
29
and
south
of
highway
60.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
that
is
still
a
geographic
designation
and
not
a
route
designation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
normal
and
logical.
does
that
mean
that
you
consider
merely
geographic
distance
and
not
transportation
facts
which
may
make
the
routing
through
the
gateway
points
a
normal
and
logical
transportation
transaction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
said
80
is
--
is
smaller
than
160,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
--
that's
all
they
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
now,
did
--
did
the
petitioners
here
introduce
evidence
justifying
that
security
on
transportation
economics?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
examiners
have
--
did
you
challenge
that
he
had
a
bona
fide
business
purpose,
bona
fide
transportation
reason.
the
question
of
dollars
and
cents
in
the
profitable
conduct
of
his
business
of
not
doing
the
u.s.
route
11
but
he
went
through
--
through
the
west
virginia
town
for
the
reason
that
an
honest
businessman
would.
did
you
challenge
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
i
ssuppose
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
in
that
certificate
explicitly
taking
over
the
fact
of
the
kind
of
business
they're
engaged
in,
they
said,
that
this
certificate
allowed
the
certificate
holder
to
go
from
bluefield
to
west
virginia
although
he
knew
this
route.
would
the
state
commission
then
have
--
could
then
have
as
--
as
in
the
case
you
now
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
question
is
whether
a
certificate
which
designates,
gives
the
authority,
that
supreme
point
one
outside
the
state
and
one
inside
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nevertheless,
the
exercise
for
that
certificate
is
a
bona
fide
transportation
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
bar
him
from
exercising
that
certificate
in
that
way
simply
because
geographically
that
he
might
have
gone
go
between
those
two
points
on
the
basis
of
the
triangle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position
or
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
certificate
was
outstanding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
are
your
reading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
any
--
must
not
--
this
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
eichholz
decision
and
doesn't
that
the
decision
rest
on
the
fact
--
fact
in
those
cases
namely,
that
there
was
no
such
justification
going
from
kansas
city,
missouri
from
kansas
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
not
such
justification
in
transportation
economics
as
the
--
as
the
petitioner
made
in
this
case.
but
in
that
case
the
(inaudible)
that
there
was
that
security
for
the
very
purpose
of
avoiding
the
direct
intra
point
of
transportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wanted
to
know
of
your
--
i'm
just
standing
right
behind
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
did
i
understand
you
to
agree
that
the
petitioners,
the
defendants
in
your
proceedings
did
establish
that
the
honest
and
--
and
profitable
way
of
doing
business
is
the
way
they
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
couldn't
have
picked
up
traffic
as
(inaudible)
they
could
go
on
directly,
could
they?
they
didn't
have
to
prove
that.
that's
self
evident,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
they
take
the
circuitous
route?what
did
they
establish,
would
it
be
against
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
i
understand
that.
that's
a
legal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
economic
fact
did
they
prove
when
it
came
to
them,
what
is
their
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
they've
done
what
you
wanted
them
to
do.
they
couldn't
have
done
any
of
those
things,
could
they?
their
traffic
would
have
been
less
and
handling
of
it
would
be
more
costly.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
have
(inaudible)
with
the
other
--
with
the
non-bulk
with
the
bulk
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
on
that
point
is
that
the
certificate
didn't
grant
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
the
i.c.c.
--
i'm
asking
because
i
don't
know.
could
the
i.c.c.
in
this
proceeding
and
if
this
so-called
declaratory
proceeding
has
said,
but
this
has
then
created
a
controversy
about
this
thing
we
now
amend
this
certificate.
could
they
have
done
in
actual
proceedings
and
leave
no
doubt
about
it.
could
they
have
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
if
they
could
have
if
presenting
is
all
they
have
or
didn't
they
have.
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
they
could
if
they
chose
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
definitely
certain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
require
an
independent
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
with
notice
to
everybody,
is
that
it?
