justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
you
mean
the
whole
--
all
of
that
is
40
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
only
the
map
withheld
to
routes,
leads
over
to
bristol
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
many
roots
and
that's
the
direct
line
to
south
virginia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
was
usual
points
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whitfield?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
point
to
this
to
the
boundary
in
some
area
of
bluefield,
that
is
from
(inaudible)
to
that
from
the
west
virginia
town
which
you
deliver
to
whitfield,
an
economical
and
to
yourselves
an
economical
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
coming
to
the
direct
routes
from
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
direct
route
to
the
--
taking
all
with
that
factor,
thus,
would
be
not
favorable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
couldn't
define
the
relevance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
there's
a
question
of
state
power
in
relation
to
a
modification
or
other
effects
upon
the
--
basically,
the
district.
is
that
a
question
for
deciding
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
meant
and
there
is
that
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
put
in
your
certificate
or
you
did
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
court
rules
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
criminal
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
a
commission
of
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
--
what's
--
what's
the
burden
without
the
reason
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
became
like
a
motion
to
direct
a
verdict,
the
federal
courts
have
as
opposed
to
these
--
you
didn't
make
a
case,
before
that's
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
make
that
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
171.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
m.c.c.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
that
precise
route
that
the
commission
authorizes
the
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
--
what
about
the
petitioner
himself,
at
least
may
get
to
--
page
101
going
back
to
the
record.
are
these
one
of
the
things
you're
talking
about
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
fining
those
and
i
think
that
that
was
on
page
101
(inaudible)
and
that's
the
significant
part
of
the
certificate
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
where
if
it's
before
us,
the
evidence
for
that
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
evidence
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
am
also
correct
that
while
this
determination
(inaudible)
brought
to
your
attention
and
this
would
be
the
opinion
of
the
court
with
no
reference
that
whatever
is
made
here
to
the
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
--
i
understand
you
to
say
(inaudible)
including
what
the
i.c.c.
has
told
them
legally
he
may
do
what
it
needs,
legally
the
only
way
through
that.
