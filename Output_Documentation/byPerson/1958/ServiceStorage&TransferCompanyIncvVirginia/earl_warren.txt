company,
petitioner
versus
commonwealth
of
virginia.
mr.
mcinerny,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
scale
of
that
map,
please
do
--
just
--
just
so
we
would
know
approximately.
chief
justice
earl
warren
period
is
40
miles.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
inch
to
five
miles
that's
the
--
one
is
to
five
miles.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
attempt
to
buy
the
other
side
to
--
to
show
that
you
had
acted
differently
so
far
as
that
central
terminal
is
concerned
in
--
in
intrastate
shipments
from
interstate
shipments.
now,
i
noticed
that
from
roanoke
there
up
to
that
other
--
other
map,
other
city
you
probably
make
the
greatest
detour
of
all
and
that's
in
the
--
that's
in
another
state,
that's
interstate.
you
wouldn't
have
the
same
problem
that
you
have
in
this
state
in
this
case
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
did
they
--
did
they
claim
that
that
was
deliberate,
they
secure
too
and
for
the
same
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i
was
saying.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
shown
that
--
do
they
attempt
to
show
in
any
way
that
your
rates
were
out
of
line
with
the
other
operations
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they're
about
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
others
--
are
there
others
that
make
the
same
points
or
approximately
the
same
points?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
your
--
what
is
your
point
that
you
do
have
by
virtue
of
your
certificate
itself,
if
you
had
a
binding
of
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
annotated
the
action
of
course
with
the
--
with
the
virginia
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
mr.
mcilwaine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
significant
that
after
finding
that
this
constituted
bona
fide
transportation
in
interstate
commerce,
the
commission
said,
“this
conclusion
finds
support
in
the
fact
that
the
routes
employed
between
virginia
points
are
not
only
--
are
not
unduly
circuitous
or
impracticable
but,
on
the
contrary,
are
such
as
might
normally
be
used
by
any
carrier
authorized
to
operate
between
the
virginia
points
involved
in
the
bluefield,
west
virginia,
this
petitioner's
headquarters
and
the
base
and
whether
substantial
operators
to
and
from
points
in
virginia
from
which
the
operation
challenge
are
only
a
part.”
and
then
they
go
on
to
find
that
the
operation
with
--
within
the
authority
granted
by
them
in
the
certificates.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
did
have
those
routes
before
them
in
someway
or
another.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
record
--
was
your
record
before
the
railroad
commission
or
your
public
utilities
commission
before
the
i.c.c.?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
mcilwaine,
have
you
finished
your
argument
or
were
you
just
stopping
now
because
--
because
of
adjournment
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thanks
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
i
--
because
if
you
have,
i'd
just
like
to
ask
mr.
mcinerny
and
if
he
has
anything
(inaudible),
if
he
do,
well,
he
might
as
well
finish
it.
we
only
have
a
few
moments.
no,
you
have
--
no
you
have
thirty
seven
minutes
that
you
got.
so
if
you
have
more,
we'll
hear
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
monday
afternoon.
it's
when
we'll
meet
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
all
right.
