mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
in
this
case
that
it
has
the
right
to
enter
the
order
of
which
he
did
finding
the
appellants
in
this
case
on
the
occasion's
name
upon
the
ground,
two
grounds
one,
asserted
chiefly
by
our
state
corporation
commission
which
is
in
effect
our
public
utilities
commission.
that
the
use
of
an
indirect
and
abnormal
right
through
another
state
is
not
interstate
commerce
protected
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
secondly,
upon
the
ground
that
if
it
is
interstate
commerce
within
the
protection
of
the
federal
motor
carrier
act,
then
in
any
situation
in
which
the
virginia
public
utilities
commission
makes
a
determination
of
fact,
prior
to
the
time
in
which
the
matter
has
been
ultimately
and
dispositively
settled
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
then
virginia
has
the
right
to
regulate,
at
least,
until
the
time
the
i.c.c.
has
entered
an
order
which
is
contrary.
now
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
position
plus
the
fact
that
a
circuitous
route
was
used
between
those
2
points,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
this
is
--
yes
--
this
is
the
combined
certificate
on
page
101.
they're
set
out
in
two
separate
places
on
page
90
and
combined
on
page
101.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
--
it
is,
your
honor,
but
it's
--
it
is
not
as
--
it
does
not
require
the
use
of
a
specific
right.
it
permits
as
shown
here
the
--
in
the
first
opinion
it
permits
the
transportation
of
from
(inaudible)
located
in
this
area
to
bluefield,
west
virginia
and
without
specific
reference
to
route.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
a
geographic
destination,
west
of
highway
29
which
is
here
and
south
of
highway
60
which
is
here.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
virginia
public
utilities
commission
which
is
our
state
corporation
commission
that
if
the
goods
originate
in
virginia
and
they
are
destined
for
another
place
in
virginia
and
if
in
transit,
they
--
a
circuitous
route
is
used
to
take
them
through
another
state
or
as
in
this
case
not
actually
through
another
state
but
merely
into
a
city
which
is
in
another
state.
and
then
out
again,
when
the
normal
and
logical
right
as
in
this
case
of
roanoke
to
whitfield
is
80
miles
across
the
base
of
the
triangle
down
u.s.
11
on
flat
land
exactly
the
case
here.
when
you
look
at
the
usual
logical
normal
route
between
those
two
points
and
see
that
it
is
in
virginia.
and
when
you
are
faced
with
the
proposition
in
which
an
interstate
carrier
is
holding
the
same
goods
as
shown
by
the
record
twice
the
distance,
160
miles
from
roanoke
to
bluefield
and
back
to
whitfield.
instead
of
moving
in
a
generally
southwesterly
direction
for
80
miles,
moving
in
a
westerly
direction
beyond
the
point
of
destination
and
then
coming
back
that
the
fact
that
the
origin
and
the
destination
points
are
in
virginia
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
route
being
used
by
the
particular
carrier
is
not
the
normal
and
logical
route
is
sufficient
to
constitute
this
transportation
intrastate
transportation.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
was
the
view
of
the
state
corporation
commission
in
this
case,
your
honor.
whether
it
had
specific
knowledge
of
other
intrastate
carriers
moving
down
u.s.
29,
this
distance
of
80
miles
or
knew
from
its
own
knowledge
that
this
distance
of
80
miles
was
the
simpler
with
method
insofar
as
economy
of
handling
or
are
both
the
breaking
points
such
as
bluefield,
west
virginia.
that
is
not
shown
in
the
record.
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
the
state
corporation
commission
took
the
point
of
origin
and
the
point
of
destination.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
if
it's
over
you
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir
pointing
out
that
it
is
u.s
that
it
is
a
good
route
between
at
the
base.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
they
introduced
evidence
to
show
that
for
them
that
circuitous
route
could
be
used
economically
for
them.
but
if
your
honors,
please
that
is
one
of
the
two
points
i
want
to
make.
i
understand
that
--
that
it
wasn't
asked
of
appellant's
counsel
here,
why
was
this
done
and
was
it
done
for
purposes
of
economics?
that
is
assumed
that
it
was
done
for
purposes
of
economics.
the
primary
reason
it
was
not
carried
from
roanoke
to
whitfield
is
because
he's
not
authorized
by
the
virginia
public
utilities
commission
to
run
from
roanoke
to
whitfield
down
u.s.
11.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
for
the
conclusion
that
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
said
he
has
no
certificate,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well
i
--
i
would
say
the
reason
for
the
use
of
the
circuitous
route
is
that
he
could
not
use
u.s.
11
from
roanoke
to
whitfield
wholly
within
the
state
of
virginia
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
evidence
is
that
he
used
it
--
for
that
he
could
use
it
economically.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
did
not
challenge
that
before
in
this
--
in
the
corporation
commission,
your
honor
upon
--
upon
the
ground
that
without
a
certificate,
there
would
not
be
any
reason
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
this
intrastate
route
could
be
used.
there
would
be
no
basis
of
comparison.
even
if
he
could
do
it
profitably
by
--
as
he
established
by
his
evidence
that
he
could
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
would
not
have
the
case
we
now
have,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
our
position
is,
your
honor
that
--
that
is
substantially
our
position
with
one
further
fact
that
we
would
like
to
make
clear
on
the
record
namely
that
this
particular
case
was
decided
by
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission.
it
was
heard
on
november
the
29th
of
1956.
it
was
decided
the
following
february.
there
were
no
proceedings
pending
before
the
i.c.c.
at
the
time
the
virginia
public
utilities
commission
or
our
state
corporation
commission
issued
its
order
or
had
its
hearing.
the
i.c.c.
application
was
filed
on
january
the
14th.
on
february
the
26th,
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission
entered
its
order
fining
the
appellant
in
this
case.
it
came
--
its
opinion
was
rendered
on
march
21st.
the
state's
opinion
was
rendered
on
march
21st
implementing
its
order
of
preceding
february
the
26th
and
it
was
not
until
march
the
29th
after,
all
of
these
had
transpired,
that
the
i.c.c.
interpreted
its
certificate.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
certificate
was
definitely
outstanding.
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
interpreted
it.
they
say
as
meaning
that
this
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
there
is
to
my
mind,
your
honor
especially
in
connection
with
their
reliance
upon
the
atlantic
case
because
the
interpretation
of
the
certificate
by
the
i.c.c.
is
by
no
means
definite
and
clear.
and
to
my
mind
it
raises
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
i.c.c.
might
not
have
decided
this
matter
another
way
upon
other
evidence.
now
the
particular
decision
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
believe
i
can
best
explain
it,
your
honor
by
referring
to
the
actual
language
of
the
certificate
which
is
of
the
declaratory
order
of
the
i.c.c.
which
is
set
out
on
page
27
(a),
appendix
3
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
it
is
not
in
--
the
language
is
not
contained
in
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
brief.
it's
on
page
27
(a).
now,
that
is
--
that
was
decided
as
your
honors
will
note
on
march
29th
1957.
that
is
the
last
action
that
was
taken
in
this
case
before
the
matter
was
brought
to
the
supreme
court
appeals
of
virginia
and
ultimately
here.
this
is
the
last
administrative
action
taken
in
this
place.
when
this
decision
was
rendered,
the
virginia
rule
to
show
cause
had
already
been
issued.
the
cause
had
been
heard,
virginia
public
utility
commission
had
decided
it
which
of
state
corporation
commission
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
be
--
yes,
your
honor
it
was.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
if
i
may
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
language
on
page
29
(a)
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
it
says
petitioner,
that
is
the
appellant
here
asserts
that
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission
during
the
past
several
months
has
instituted
proceedings
against
it
for
the
purpose
of
penalizing
it
for
conducting
operations
from
one
point
in
virginia
to
another
point
in
that
state,
notwithstanding
the
fact,
that
the
shipments
moved
through
bluefield
west
virginia.
additionally,
staff
members
of
the
state
corporations
commission's
office
are
said
to
have
advised
shippers
and
consignee's
that
transportation
performed
by
petitioner
in
a
--
the
single
line
or
joint-line
service
from
one
virginia
point
to
another
virginia
point
through
bluefield,
west
virginia
does
not
constitute
interstate
commerce
and
that
they
should
cease
tendering
to
petitioner
traffic
moving
between
virginia
points.
that
also
is
currently
defendant
before
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission,
a
proceeding
in
which
state
enforcement
officials
contended
that
certain
shipments
handled
from
virginia
origins
to
virginia
destinations
through
bluefield
west
virginia
are
not
interstate
and
accordingly
cannot
lawfully
be
handled
by
the
petitioner.
that
if
you
will
turn
over
to
page
30,
you
have
the
--
what
we
consider
the
heart
of
the
order
here.
the
court,
the
i.c.c.
said
this.
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
that
petitioner's
use
of
its
authorized
route
is
a
subterfuge
to
avoid
state
regulation
or
other
than
the
logical
and
normal
operation
to
the
carrier's
headquarters
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
petitioner's
operations
in
the
manner
of
described
constitute
bona
fide
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
you
will
note
that
that
language
says
that
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
that
petitioner's
use
of
its
authorized
route
is
a
subject
used
to
avoid
state
regulation.
we
hold
that
it
is
bona
fide
interstate
commerce
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
declaratory
order
which
shows
what
operations
the
i.c.c.
had
under
consideration
when
it
made
that
determination
or
what
operations
the
i.c.c.
is
referring
to.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
sir.
it
did
not.
it
had
even
then
in
the
best
of
the
public
utilities
commission
the
very
question
which
the
appellant
sought
to
make
the
virginia
public
utilities
commission
a
defendant
or
a
party
in.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
no
reference
is
made
to
it
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
--
no
consideration.
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeal's
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir.
and
then
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
as
i
read
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
understand
that
the
eichholz
case
is
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
my
understanding
of
that
case,
your
honor
is
that
it
was
not
for
economic
reasons
but
simply
to
avoid
regulation
by
the
state
commission
that
in
eichholz
the
petitioner
went
across
the
river
and
came
back
in
effect
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
simply
to
escape
the
regulation
not
because
of
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
they
established
that
they
could
do
it
profitably
this
way.
there
is
nothing
to
compare
it
with,
with
respect
to
the
--
how
much
more
profitable
it
might
be
or
would
be.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
--
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
it
is
to
virginia
--
of
course,
we
say
they
took
the
circuitous
route
because
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
it
is
the
only
route
they
could
legally
take.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
they
approved
what
mr.
mcinerny
had
show
here.
that
this
is
a
--
a
breakdown
point
for
them
that
they
take
the
smaller
shipment
here,
move
them
to
bluefield
in
truckload
lots.
they
have
the
--
it
is
broken
up
and
other
shipments
which
are
purely
interstate
since
they
originate
in
west
virginia
and
come
to
virginia,
are
also
brought
here
broken
down,
particular
shipments
rearranged
and
then
carried
to
whitfield
and
bristol
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
understand
that
that
is
established
on
the
records,
your
honor.
i
don't
understand
there's
anything
with
respect
to
cause
if
they
had
done
it
as
the
virginia
state
commission
says
they
should
have
done
it.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
they
couldn't
have
done
that.
that's
true
because
they
would
not
have
been
in
their
headquarters
breakdown
point
in
bluefield
west
virginia.
that
is
unquestionable
truth.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
if
i
may
make
two
observations
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
in
connection
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
first
is
the
fact
that
the
routes
employed
between
virginia
points
are
not
unduly
circuitous
or
impracticable.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
now,
we
have
in
this
case
17
charges
of
violation
in
which
the
virginia
public
utility
commission
or
state
corporation
--
state
corporation
commission
found
a
violation
in
only
seven.
so
--
and
as
they
pointed
out
in
their
opinion,
they
agree
that
transportation
from
some
virginia
points
to
other
virginia
points
may
well
be
interstate
commerce,
subject
only
to
the
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
if
the
normal
and
logical
route
lies
that
way.
but
on
seven
of
them,
virginia
found
that
those
routes
were
not
the
normal
and
logical
routes.
now,
there's
nothing
in
this
declaratory
order
which
is
all
we
have
with
respect
to
what
transpired
before
the
i.c.c.
there
is
nothing
in
this
to
show
exactly
which
of
the
routes
or
if
there
is
in
fact
a
conflict
between
what
the
i.c.c.
has
said
here
and
what
the
virginia
public
utilities
commission
found
with
respect
with
--
to
this
particular
example,
for
instance.
they
also
said
it
is
not
unduly
circuitous
for
one
who
must
go
through
this
point.
now,
we
--
we
will
agree
for
one
who
must,
under
his
i.c.c.
certificate,
go
through
this
point.
this
route
is
not
unduly
circuitous.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
the
virginia
state

--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
doubt,
your
honor.
you
must
go
through
bluefield
as
gateway.
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
distinction
between
what
the
virginia
state
corporate
commission
said
and
what
the
i.c.c.
said.
the
i.c.c.
said
this
route
is
not
unduly
circuitous
for
one
who
must
go
from
this
point.
but
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission
said,
160
miles
over
a
mountain
range
rather
than
80
miles
down
the
valley
is
unduly
circuitous
for
a
businessman
who
would
not
be
regulated.
they
stressed
the
word
“unregulated”
no
“unregulated”
businessman
would
do
that.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
mean
that
is
the
only
way
they
could
--
it
would
be
possible
for
them
to
legally
go.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
question
in
this
--
and
that
is
the
question
in
this
case
your
honor.
whether
this
certificate
which
authorizes
this
transportation
by
the
attacking
of
two
particular
grounds,
does
authorize
this
transportation
between
two
virginia
termini
over
an
---
a
circuitous
and
illogical
route.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
would.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
that
may
someday
become
a
question,
your
honor.
i
will
stipulate
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
particular
case
because
i
don't
think
the
conflict
exists.
we
take
the
point,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
what
the
i.c.c
has
said
in
this
case
or
no
demonstrable
conflict
on
the
record
between
what
the
virginia
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
say
that
virginia
may
penalize
this
traffic.
we
--
as
i
said
we
have
two
alternative
values.
we
say
that
virginia
may
penalize
this
traffic
in
the
first
instance
when
there
has
been
no
final
determination
by
the
i.c.c.
that
this
particular
traffic
is
authorized
by
their
certificate.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
then
it
could
not
be
shown
by
looking
at
the
certificate
that
it
did
grant
that
authority
and
it
is
not
certain
at
this
point
whether
or
not
even
under
the
--
the
declaratory
judgment
which
was
answered
that
the
i.c.c.
was
actually
passing
on
the
particular
case
which
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission
had
before
it.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
believe
in
that
particular
proceeding
simply
as
a
procedural
matter,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
think
they
could
have
amended
this
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
believe
it
would.
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
would
have
--
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
i
--
i
have
no
expertise
before
the
i.c.c.
on
that
point
of
amending
a
certificate
but
i
would
believe
so.
but
i
would
point
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
have
no
way
of
knowing,
your
honor
nor
on
the
record
does
any
member
of
this
court.
this
court
knows
what
went
on
before
the
i.c.c.
because
of
the
declaratory
judgment
in
this
case.
that
is
all
the
record
shows
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
what
was
before
the
i.c.c.
and
i
most
respectfully
submit
that
no
member
of
this
court
can
from
the
record
determine
what
was
before
the
i.c.c.
and
i
use
that
point
in
specific
reference
to
the
atlantic
case
upon
which
they
rely,
the
opinion
in
the
atlantic
case
for
i.c.c.
shows
definitely
and
firmly
that
they
were
taking
up
exactly
the
same
case
which
the
state
had
taken
up,
that
they
were
deciding
exactly
the
same
point.
that
they
were
considering
exactly
the
same
route
which
the
state
had
held
the
carrier
could
not
go
over
and
they
were
directly
holding
that
under
their
certificate
he
could
go
over
that
route
so
that
you
had
a
direct
conflict
between
the
two.
under
the
record
in
this
case,
no
such
conflict
exist
between
the
decision
of
the
declaratory
judgement
although
the
i.c.c.
with
respect
to
the
prior
determination
by
the
virginia
commission
that
this
traffic
was
in
fact
intrastate
and
could
be
regulated
by
the
virginia
state
corporation
commission.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
am
--
i
have
substantially
completed
my
argument

mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii

your
honor
