at
all.
those
--
those
are
the
facts.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
canvassing
the
entire
record,
held
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
of
any
prejudice
to
petitioner
and
therefore
held
that
he
had
not
been
denied
due
process.
we
asked
the
court
to
affirm
that
holding.
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question,
mr.
hamer,
so
far
as
i
know,

never
been
prosecuted.
statute
of
limitations
is
run
on
a

whether
it
is
run
on
a
disciplinary
proceeding.

is
a
highly
debatable
question
under
the
illinois
law
at
the
present
time.
