justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
follow
on
you
there,
mr.
leighton.
i
read
that
same
statement
in
your
brief,
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
follow
what
you
mean
by
saying
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
when
the
--
when
the
witness
--
when
hamer
first
testified,
he
said
nobody
promised
him
anything.
i
don't
have
it.
i'm
not
reading
it,
but
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
paraphrasing
it
from
my
memory.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
and
then
on
cross-examination,
he
said,
“well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
somebody
from
the
public
defender's
office
did
say
he'd
use
his
best
efforts
on
my
behalf.”
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
on
redirect
examination,
he
told
the
--
mr.
myers,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
that
mr.
myers
hadn't
promised
him
anything
at
all
and
that
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
--
that's
about
the
way
the
record
shows.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
the
fact
is
that
in
--
that
in
answer
to
the
last
question
on
redirect
examination,
that
was
perjury
and
the
--
and
the
perjury
was
not
revealed
to
the
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
on
those
--
among
the
allegations
in
that
earlier
writ
however,
wasn't
there
a
claim
of
the
use
--
unconstitutional
use
of
a
coerced
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
and
doesn't
it
appear
now
in
the
record
of
this
case
as
a
record
on
page
45
and
57
and
maybe
elsewhere
that
no
--
no
confession
was
used
in
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
the
record
at
page
45,
the
petitioner
himself
says,
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“they
did
not
use
any
confession
in
my
trial.”
justice
potter
stewart
now,
while
we're
on
the
facts,
mr.
leighton,
you've
confront
yourself,
as
i
gather,
the
--
perhaps
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
to
the
version
of
the
facts
contained
in
the
application
for
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
on
behalf
of
hamer
which
was
filed
by
myers.
justice
potter
stewart
myers
also
testified
in
this
very
case,
didn't
he,
and
his
testimony
appearing
on
pages
50
to
60
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
that
his
testimony
particularly
that
on
page
58
and
59
very
substantially
from
what's
contained
in
his
application
for
the
writ
of
error
coram
nobis?
justice
potter
stewart
on
behalf
of
the
state
actually.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
actually
an
affidavit
or
was
it
an
unsworn
pleading?
justice
potter
stewart
4.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
and
insofar
as
there
is
a
factual
conflict,
i
--
it's
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
--
the
majority
of
the
court,
the
court
itself
found
the
facts
as
they
appear,
substantially
as
they
appear
in
the
affidavit.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
way
therefore
foreclosed
by
that
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally
and
before
you
leave
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
probably
is
entirely
irrelevant.
i'm
just
curious.
what
was
the
upshot
of
the
application
on
behalf
of
hamer?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
a
--
isn't
that
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
it
was
known
that
some
perjury
was
committed
but
the
jury
was
never
told
how
much
perjury
was
committed.
isn't
that
really
the
fact
of
the
matter?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
