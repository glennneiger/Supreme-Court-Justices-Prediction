are
you
sitting
down?
i
--
i
just
wonder.
what
do
you
think
the
hysler
case
has
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
passing
upon
the
adequacy
of
the
affidavits
submitted
to
the
florida
supreme
court
under
its
procedure
that
the
florida
supreme
court
to
decide
whether
there's
enough
to
raise
the
question
of
fact
before
the
trial
court.
i
forget
the
name
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
here's
an
--
here,
the
point
is,
there's
no
question
about
conceded
use
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
conceded
use
of
perjury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
concededly
used
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
the
knowledge
of
the
district
attorney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
what
is
the
--
how
can
you
say
--
what's
the
bearing
of
the
hysler
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
a
question.
whether
--
you
can
call
it
a
question
of
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
it's
an
ultimate
determination
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
that's
what
this
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
wasn't
hysler
at
all.
hysler
--
the
hysler
case
raised
the
--
raised
the
question
whether
the
local
florida
procedure
by
which
you
could
go
into
the
trial
court
if
convicted
and
there
established
the
fact
that
in
fact,
the
district
attorney
used
perjurious
testimony
whether
it
is
outside
of
the
due
process
clause
to
have
a
shifting
process.
thereby,
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
on
affidavit,
is
asked
to
determine
whether
there's
enough
of
an
issue
on
that
underlying
question
of
fact,
namely,
can
you
made
out
a
case
to
bring
him
to
question
to
impeach
the
untaintedness
of
a
verdict?
here,
the
question
is,
there
was
use
of
perjurious
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
the
state
said,
â€œwell,
we
look
at
the
record
and
we
say
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
if
this
fellow
had
never
put
on
the
stand
or
had
never
lied?
that's
right,
isn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
add
a
touch
of
precision
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
knowingly
used?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
jury
knew
that
--
but
the
jury
didn't
know
that
it
was
the
district
attorney
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
stating
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
make
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
difference
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
the
jury
may
recoil
from
bringing
in
a
--
a
death
sentence
when
it
knew
that
the
district
attorney
was
up
to
getting
the
witness
to
perjure
himself.
jury
--
a
jury
might
be
called
even
in
chicago.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
am
i
drawing
on
fantasy?
is
it
just
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
is
that
the
world
of
reality?
i
should
think
the
pressure
exerted
by
the
state
is
one
thing,
the
pressure
exerted
by
the
assistant
public
defender
is
another.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
are
very
different
things.
