mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
the
court.
your
honors,
mr.
leighton
has
made
a
fair
statement
of
the
case
as
he
invariably
does.
however,
it
may
assist
the
court
in
his
consideration
of
this
case
by
stating
the
facts
a
little
more
elaborately
than
he
did
and
i
refer
not
only
to
the
facts
that
he
omitted
that
helped
the
state
but
facts
that
he
omitted
which,
i
think,
may
help
the
petitioner.
the
perspective
of
the
facts
is
this.
on
the
day
in
1938
in
question,
four
men
entered
a
cocktail
lounge
near
the
wee
hours
of
the
morning
armed
and
undertook
to
execute
a
holdup.
an
off-duty
police
officer,
police
officer
off-duty
by
the
name
of
o'malley
drew
his
gun
and
started
shooting.
officer
o'malley
was
fatally
wounded
in
the
mallei,
the
affray
and
died
some
nine
days
later.
also
slain
in
the
affray
was
one
of
the
robbers
named
townsend.
one
of
the
participants
in
the
robber
was
--
in
the
robbery
was
this
witness
hamer.
two
other
men,
one
of
whom
hamer
identifies
as
petitioner
napue
took
hamer
out.
still
a
fifth
man
was
at
the
wheel
of
a
car.
one
man,
your
honors
will
recall,
one
of
the
robbers
had
been
slain
and
was
in
the
cocktail
lounge.
the
policeman
was
mortally
wounded.
these
two
men
who
were
not
hurt
took
hamer
who
was
badly
wounded
in
the
chest
and
the
third
man
drove
hamer
with
them
to
a
doctor's
office.
hamer
was
left
at
the
doctor's
office.
the
doctor
administered
first
aid,
perhaps
saved
his
life,
and
called
the
police.
hamer
confessed
--
well,
that
isn't
quite
a
fair
statement.
hamer
admitted
participating
in
the
robbery
but
said
at
first
that
he
was
an
involuntary
participant,
that
the
other
men
told
him
that
they
were
going
for
an
automobile
ride
that
they
stopped
into
the
cocktail
lounge,
that
he
didn't
know
that
any
robbery
was
meditated
and
that
somebody
handed
him
a
shotgun
and
said,
“this
is
a
stickup,”
and
that
he
wasn't
an
involuntary
participant
in
the
robbery.
he
identified
poe,
webb
and
petitioner,
napue,
as
three
of
the
other
four
participants
in
the
robbery,
the
fourth
being,
of
course,
townsend
who
had
been
slain
in
the
robbery.
poe
was
apprehended,
tried,
convicted,
sentenced
to
death
and
has
been
executed.
petitioner
was
apprehended
some
two
years
after
the
original
occurrence.
it
appears
that
he
made
a
confession.
it
does
not
appear
that
the
confession
was
used
in
his
trial.
it
appears
that
he
reenacted
the
crime.
it
doesn't
appear
whether
that
reenactment
was
testified
too
at
his
trial.
he
was
tried
and
on
the
trial,
hamer
was
brought
from
the
penitentiary
and
testified
against
him.
i
think
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
so
to
be
absolutely
accurate,
i
would
like
to
read
some
of
the
language
in
which
perjury
admittedly
consists.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
question
the
fact.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
see
anyway
to
avoid
it
and
then
meted,
your
honor,
after
--
after
studying
this
record.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
found
that
there
was.
and
while
you
--
your
honors
can
review
a
--
a
state
supreme
court's
finding
of
fact,
i
think
one
is
favorable
to
the
petitioner
just
as
you
can
once
the
adverse
of
the
petitioner.
i
am
convinced
there
was
perjury
in
this
record
myself.
now,
was
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
--
i
--
at
several
places
in
the
record,
i
will
read
from
the
dissenting
opinion
which
begins
at
page
73
in
the
brown-covered
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
myers,
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
interrogating
hamer
and
he
asks,
“did
anybody
give
you
a
reward
or
promise
you
a
reward
for
testifying?”
answer,
“there
ain't
nobody
promised
me
anything,”
after
some
material
that
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
state
deem
as
important
to
print,
hamer
is
asked
by
myers,
“directing
your
attention
to
that
time
and
place
in
statesville,
did
you
tell
mr.
steinberg,"
one
of
napue's
attorneys,
"that
you
were
drunk
that
day?"
"no,
i
didn't."
i
don't
want
to
read
all
of
this.
hamer
had
pleaded
guilty
and
been
sentenced.
he
testified
that
a
man
whom
he
thought
to
be
an
assistant
public
defender
had
promised
to
recommend
leniency
to
the
proper
authorities
if
he
would
testify
against
his
co-defendants.
he
said
he
thought
the
man
was
a
public
defender.
on
redirect
examination,
he
testified
that
the
trial
judge
had
promised
him
nothing.
and
the
last
question
he
was
asked,
“have
i,”
that's
mr.
myers,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
“promised
that
i
would
recommend
any
reduction
of
sentence
to
anybody?”
the
answer
is,
“you
did
not.”
now,
myers
deposed
in
his
affidavit
that
in
fact
although
him
--
he,
himself,
elicited
this
testimony,
"you
have
not
made
me
any
promise."
he
had
promised
the
petitioner
that
if
the
other
witnesses,
the
other
participants
corroborated
hamer's
claim
that
he
was
an
involuntary
participant
in
the
robbery,
he
would
recommend
a
reduction
in
the
sentence.
but
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
that
petitioner
could
hardly
have
understood
hamer's
promise
to
be
other
--
anything
other
than
a
categorical
promise
to
recommend
leniency
if
he
would
cooperate
in
testifying
against
his
co-defendants.
now,
the
question
that
emerges
from
this
record
is
this,
your
honors,
and
its
foreknown
which
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
divided
by
two.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
know.
maybe
mr.
leighton
knows.
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
i
--
i
don't
know
on
the
record
or
off
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
wines
hamer's
sentence
was
199
years,
as
i
recall.
now,
the
question
as
phrased
in
our
brief
is,
i
think,
carefully
and
accurately
phrased.
we
thus
phrase
it.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
murder
upon
inter
alia
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice
who
first
denied
then
admitted
that
he
had
been
promised
the
recommendation
of
leniency
for
his
testimony.
however,
the
witness
testified
falsely
as
to
the
author
of
the
promise
of
leniency,
ascribing
the
promise
to
a
man
who
may
believe
to
be
an
assistant
public
defender
when,
in
fact,
the
testimony
--
the
promise
was
that
of
the
prosecuting
attorney.
the
prosecuting
attorney
vowed
safe
to
the
court
no
revelation
of
the
falsity
of
the
testimony
and
conviction
ensued.
the
question
is
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
the
jury
was
surprised
by
hamer
that
he
had
lied.
they
were
not
apprised,
however,
as
to
the
author
of
the
false
testimony.
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
concluded
that
in
no
reasonable
likelihood
could
the
identity
of
the
author
of
the
admitted
promise
of
leniency
have
resulted
in
an
acquittal
or
any
lesser
sentence
in
that
meted
to
petitioner
and
held
that
there
had
been
not
any
denial
of
that
fairness
which
is
of
the
essence
of
due
process
avowal.
they
affirmed
the
trial
court's
dismissal
of
petitioner's
post-conviction
proceeding,
two
justices
dissent.
those
are
the
facts
and
that
is
the
question.
and
i
have
very
little
to
say
other
than
to
argue
with
--
in
this
fashion.
the
supreme
court
says
in
its
opinion
that
it
doesn't
appear
whether
petitioner's
confession
was
used
against
him
or
not,
and
it
doesn't.
it
does
appear
that
no
--
no
writing
signed
by
petitioner
or
allegedly
signed
by
him
was
introduced.
it
does
appear,
however,
that
upon
being
apprehended,
he
readily
admitted
his
guilt
and
reenacted,
voluntarily
reenacted
the
slaying.
it
doesn't
appear
that
he
testified
in
his
own
behalf.
of
course,
he
didn't
have
to.
the
witness
hamer
first
said,
“nobody
has
promised
me
nothing.”
he
later
retracted
that
perjurious
statement
and
said
that
in
fact
a
promise
of
recommended
lenity
had
been
made
but
he
lied
about
who
made
the
promise,
attributing
it
to
an
assistant
public
defender
rather
than
to
the
prosecuting
attorney.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
respected
the
rule
of
mooney
against
holohan
and
sequent
cases.
and
it
--
there's
still
the
essence
of
its
holding
in
this
case
in
language
that
i
should
like
to
cite
briefly,
if
i
may
have
the
chief
justice's
permission.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said,
“where
a
conviction
is
obtained
by
the
--
a
presentation
of
testimony
known
by
the
prosecuting
authorities
to
be
perjured,
the
constitutional
requirement
of
due
process
is
not
satisfied,"
citing
authority.
"to
show
a
denial
of
due
process
within
the
meaning
of
this
rule
does
not
necessary
that
the
false
testimony
be
concerned
directly
with
a
question
of
guilt.
even
though
it
bears
only
upon
the
credibility
of
the
witness,
it
may
have
the
effect
of
depriving
the
accused
of
a
fair
trial."
then
the
supreme
court
adds
immediately
this
sentence,
“whether
such
effect
is
present,
depends,
of
course,
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case."
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
the
jury
knew
that
hamer
had
been
promised
something
that
he
was
testifying
with
an
expectation
of
reward
and
that
it
couldn't,
in
any
reasonable
likelihood,
have
made
any
difference
to
the
jury
whether
the
author
of
the
promise
was
a
member
of
the
staff
of
the
public
defender
or
of
the
staff
of
the
prosecuting
attorney.
two
justices
thought
there
was
a
vital
difference
between
the
two
functionaries,
the
public
defender
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
senate.
that's
the
position
of
illinois,
your
honors,
that
not
that
it
was
a
burden
that
--
that
--
once
a
man
is
shown
as
--
as
petitioner
did
show
that
perjury
has
been
knowingly
suborned
by
prosecuting
officials,
it
must
fairly
appear,
affirmatively
appear
that
the
perjury
couldn't,
in
any
reasonable
likelihood,
have
affected
the
result
once
it's
known
that
perjury
is
committed
even
though
there
isn't
a
disclosure
that
the
witness
has
correctly
identified
the
man
who
made
the
promise.
we
say
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
the
fact
of
the
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
want
to
disassemble
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
only
this,
your
honor,
that
in
the
hysler
case,
coram
nobis
was
brought
and
there,
the
court
--
a
majority
of
this
court
read
the
record
as
finding
that
no
perjury
had
in
fact
been
committed
or
if
committed,
it
was
not
known
to
public
officials.
the
majority
of
this
court
read
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion
as
passing
upon
the
question
of
fact.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
hysler
case
has
this
bearing
and
this
bearing
only
and
no
other.
it
holds
that
where
the
state
supreme
court
has
found
that
there
is
no
substantial
question
of
fact
as
to
the
denial
of
what
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
called
the
essential
fairness
of
the
trial,
that
finding
will
be
respected.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
finding
that
there
was
perjury
but
that
the
perjury
was
not
of
a
kind
that
could,
in
any
conceivable,
readily
conceivable
likelihood,
have
contributed
to
the
conviction
and
only
asked
that
that
be
treated
as
a
question
of
fact
and
although
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
not
--
not
precisely
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there's
a
--
there's
a
little
more
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
there's
a
little
more
than
that,
your
honor.
there
was
perjured
testimony.
mr.
william
c.
wines
knowingly
used.
the
jury
knew
that
the
man
was
a
perjurer.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
was
revealed
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
right.
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
the
nub
of
the
matter.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
that
is
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
a
jury
might.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
where
they
knew
that
the
man
was
testifying
with
a
hope
of
reward,
it
made
no
difference
once
the
whole
comment.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
they
are
--
they
are
different
things.
there's
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
the
--
the
--
i
have
stated
the
question
and
i
think
i
have
fairly
stated
the
facts
out
of
the
considerations
that
move
us
to
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
conviction.
mr.
william
c.
wines
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
thank
you.
