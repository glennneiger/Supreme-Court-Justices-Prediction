mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
which
post-conviction
relief
was
denied
to
the
petitioner.
the
federal
question
is
whether
petitioner
was
denied
due
process
of
law
in
the
illinois
criminal
court
because
perjury
was
knowingly
used
in
obtaining
petitioner's
conviction
for
the
alleged
crime
of
murder.
petitioner
is
now
serving
a
sentence
of
199
years
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary
pursuant
to
the
state
court
conviction.
in
its
judgment
to
the
opinion,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
there
was
perjury
knowingly
used
in
petitioner's
prosecution.
the
facts
arose
in
this
fashion,
if
your
honors
please.
in
an
indictment
in
the
state
court,
the
petitioner
was
prosecuted
for
a
crime
that
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
in
1938.
the
trial
took
place
in
1940.
the
principal
witness
against
the
petitioner
was
a
man
who
previously
had
plead
guilty
under
a
separate
indictment
in
which
he
was
charged
with
the
same
murder.
he
was
the
only
witness
that
the
prosecution
could
rely
upon
because
the
other
alleged
eyewitnesses
had
moved
away
from
illinois.
it
is
conceded
by
the
prosecution
in
this
particular
case
that
without
this
man's
testimony,
the
petitioner's
conviction
could
not
have
been
obtained.
the
man's
name
was
hamer.
he
was
bought
back
from
the
penitentiary
on
habeas
corpus.
on
cross-examination,
counsel
for
petitioner
here,
the
defendant
in
the
original
prosecution,
asked
this
witness
whether
or
not
he
was
testifying
freely
and
voluntarily,
and
he
said,
"yes,"
that
he
was.
on
redirect
examination,
the
prosecutor
asked
this
witness
directly,
“has
the
judge,”
naming
the
judge,
“promised
you
any
consideration
for
your
sentence,”
and
there
was
a
negative
answer.
and
then
he
asked
him,
“have
i,”
meaning
himself,
the
prosecutor,
“promised
you
any
consideration?”
and
there
was
a
negative
answer.
the
witness
was
dismissed.
some
six
years
later,
this
prosecutor
resigned
from
the
office
of
the
state's
attorney
of
cook
county.
and
on
his
own,
filed
what
in
illinois
is
called
a
coram
nobis
petition.
at
that
time,
the
post-conviction
law
of
illinois
had
not
been
adopted.
it
was
supported
by
this
prosecutor's
affidavit
in
which
he
described
in
detail
the
agreement
that
had
existed
between
him
and
this
witness
by
which
this
witness
promised
that
he
would
testify
against
the
petitioner
and
furnish
evidence
which
the
prosecutor
thought
was
indispensable
to
obtain
his
conviction
in
return
for
an
expressed
promise
that
he,
the
prosecutor,
would
recommend
to
the
appropriate
authorities
the
reduction
of
this
witness'
then
199-year
sentence.
in
fact,
the
prosecutor
was
so
strong
in
his
language
that
he
characterized
this
agreement
as
a
compact
between
this
witness
and
the
lawfully
instituted
authorities
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
return
for
his
testimony
against
the
petitioner,
flatly
contradicting
the
testimony
of
this
principal
witness
at
the
trial.
the
petitioner
then
obtained
a
copy
of
this
coram
nobis
petition
and
this
affidavit
of
this
prosecutor
and
made
it
a
part
of
his
application
for
post-conviction
review
in
the
illinois
court.
there
was
a
hearing
held
and
relief
was
denied.
there
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed,
holding
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
was
perjury
and
that
it
was
knowingly
used
according
to
the
dissenting
opinion
construing
the
majority
opinion,
five
judges
voting
for
affirmance
and
two
judges
dissenting
including
the
chief
justice
of
the
state
of
illinois.
but
the
majority
opinion
went
on
the
ground
that
this
perjury,
though
it
was
used,
somehow,
the
supreme
court
said,
was
explained
to
the
jury
by
what
they
characterized
as
subsequent
testimony.
a
reading
of
the
record,
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
shows
that
when
hamer
testified
in
direct
answer
to
the
questions
put
to
him
on
redirect
examination,
there
was
no
further
testimony
by
hamer,
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
other
kind
going
to
the
jury.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
seemed
to
adopt
the
doctrine
which
i'm
not
familiar
but
there
is
something
ameliorating
about
revelation
of
perjury
and
we
say,
in
our
brief,
we
know
of
no
--
no
such
doctrine
that
if
perjury
is
explained
to
a
jury,
it
doesn't
amount
to
the
infraction
of
the
guaranties
of
due
process
which
your
honors
have
said.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
if
i
understand
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
correctly,
your
honor,
in
the
opinion,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
perjury
was
revealed
to
the
jury.
and
because
it
was
revealed
to
the
jury,
therefore,
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
but
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
which
appears
on
page
72
of
the
record,
which,
i
think,
is
an
erroneous
construct
of
the
record,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
those
on
the
theory
that
the
perjury
which
had
been
committed
was
revealed
to
the
jury.
now,
just
where
it
was
revealed,
it
doesn't
appear
as
far
as
we
can
tell.
and
our
position
is
that
the
supreme
court
erred
in
this
construction
of
the
record
that
the
perjury
committed
by
him
was
never
revealed
because
hamer
was
discharged
as
soon
as
he
made
this
answer.
i
might
say
this
in
order
to
emphasize
the
point.
the
gravamen
of
the
injury
here
occurred
on
redirect
examination.
mr.
myers'
affidavit
clearly
shows
that
he
was
very
familiar
with
hamer.
he
had
questioned
hamer
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
he
had
prosecuted
hamer.
he
then
prosecuted
webb.
he
had
prosecuted
poe
who
was
executed.
and
i'd
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
a
fact,
which
is
significant
to
me.
it
is
common
practice
in
illinois
criminal
law
which
i
am
familiar
in
these
--
years
at
the
bar,
that
where
there
are
multiple
defendant,
the
practice
is
to
join
them
all
in
one
indictment
and
charge
them
all
as
principles
under
our
principal
and
accessory
statute.
it
is
significant,
it
seems
to
me,
that
in
this
case,
they
indicted
each
of
these
alleged
defendants
separately,
indicating
to
me
and
this
record
is
assessable
to
this
understanding
that
when
hamer
was
first
arrested,
he
never
mentioned
napue's
name
because
if
he
had,
they
would
have
returned
one
indictment
against
webb,
napue,
hamer
and
poe.
and
under
our
illinois
practice,
they
could
--
they
could
prosecute
them
each
seriatim
as
they
were
apprehended.
it
is
significant,
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
record
that
each
of
them
was
indicted
separately
and
prosecuted
separately
and
in
the
record
is
shown
the
numbers
of
their
respective
indictment,
indicating
that
when
hamer
first
spoke
to
--
to
myer,
he
did
not
tell
myer,
who
was
the
principal
prosecutor,
about
the
existence
of
napue.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
you
see,
your
honor,
the
--
the
publication
--
the
publication
of
this
--
of
this
affidavit
attracted
attention
and
it
was
a
--
a
kind
of
attention
that
seemed
through
some
people
to
have
been
laudatory.
he
was
the
spectacle
of
the
prosecutor
who
had
sent
the
man
to
199
years
in
penitentiary,
now
asking
the
court
to
give
him
relief.
it
painted
a
very
beautiful
picture
the
way
the
newspapers
took
it.
it
didn't
paint
such
a
good
picture
to
napue
who
was
in
the
prison
because
napue
read
the
newspaper
story
and
wrote
to
the
clerk
and
got
a
copy
of
mr.
myers'
affidavit.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
would
appear
so.
if
your
honor
should
read
mr.
myers'
affidavit
carefully,
it
even
contradicts
napue's
--
hamer's
testimony
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
because
mr.
myers'
testimony
creates
the
impression
that
when
hamer
was
arrested,
hamer
said
that
he
didn't
know
anything
about
this
robbery
that
allegedly
occurred
in
1938.
hamer's
testimony
which
is
incorporated
here
in
this
record
was
to
the
effect
that
when
he
left
on
this
trip
with
these
other
alleged
co-defendants,
he
knew
they
were
going
to
rob
this
place.
hamer's
testimony
is
explicit
on
that
point.
mr.
myers'
affidavit
tries
to
paint
the
picture
that
hamer
was
an
unwilling
participant
in
this
robbery.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
it
was.
it
will
be
three
years.
and
this
was
in
1946
in
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
may
i
--
may
i
answer
your
honor's
question
this
way?
if
perjury
was
committed
by
the
district
attorney,
the
assistant
state
attorney,
it
would
have
occurred
by
him.
it
would
have
been
committed
by
him
at
the
time
he
filed
his
--
his
affidavit
and
--
and
any
law
enforcement
authority
would
have
three
years
under
illinois
law
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh,
certainly.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh,
certainly.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
will
be
three
years
after
that
date.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
after
that
date.
yes,
your
honor,
on
illinois
practice.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
on
illinois
practice.
now,
i'd
like
to
devote
just
a
moment
to
the
contentions
of
the
respondent
with
regard
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner.
the
respondent
relies
in
hysler
versus
state
of
florida
which,
we
submit,
is
clearly
distinguishable.
in
the
hysler
case,
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
and
which
your
honors
upheld
was
that
the
coram
nobis
practice
under
florida
law
complied
with
the
requirements
of
due
process,
the
provisions
which
your
honors
have
said
should
be
maintained
in
some
state,
in
some
form,
by
which
post-convicting
relief
can
be
granted
one
who
claims
that
his
conviction
denied
him
due
process.
but
supreme
court
of
florida
held
plainly
that
on
hysler's
application
for
coram
nobis,
he
did
not
make
out
a
case
by
which
he
could
have
obtained
relief
even
if
he
proved
the
allegations
of
the
petition
and
the
case
was
peculiar
on
its
facts
because
as
your
honors
pointed
out,
hysler
had
remained
in
jail
for
four
years.
then
on
the
eve
of
the
execution
of
one
of
his
co-defendants,
the
co-defendant
issued
an
affidavit
exculpating
hysler.
now,
that
case
on
its
facts
was
difficult
to
handle
like
in
(c).
but
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
and
two
other
justices
of
this
court
dissented
holding
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
testing
the
credibility
of
the
affidavit
at
that
state
of
proceeding
but
rather,
if
the
allegations
were
such
as
to
show
a
denial
of
due
process,
hysler
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
which
the
denial
of
the
application
did
not
grant
him.
but
in
this
case,
in
our
case,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
found
as
a
matter
of
its
judgment
that
there
was
perjury
here.
and
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
fact
that
in
an
earlier
phase
of
the
post-conviction
proceeding,
the
petitioner
here,
napue,
had
been
denied
a
hearing
and
the
record
shows
that
he
took
a
--
an
application
for
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
remanded
the
denial
of
a
hearing,
and
this
appears
on
page
34
and
35
of
this
record,
and
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
his
allegations
in
the
post-conviction
petition
entitled
him
to
a
hearing.
and
this
judgment
of
affirmance,
denial
of
relief,
came
after
the
reversal
in
which
the
supreme
court
ruled
on
his
earlier
writ
of
error
proceeding.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there's
no
--
no
confession
was
used.
i
might
say
your
honor,
i
represented
the
petitioner
on
this
hearing
and
i
have
to
conclude
from
a
careful
reading
of
the
record
that
what
had
occurred
was
this.
there
were
some
oral
testimony
by
one
or
two
of
the
police
officers
about
a
confession
but
there
was
no
confession
actually
used.
in
fact,
mr.
myer
concedes
in
the
--
in
the
hearing
and
we
finally
got
him
to
concede,
it
appears
on
page
57
of
the
record,
that
no
written
statement
was
taken
from
petitioner.
this
was
a
--
a
construction
of
the
--
of
the
record
by
the
--
by
the
petitioner,
which,
i
think,
was
not
supported
by
the
record.
i
think
what
occurred
was
that
he
was
asked
some
questions
and
some
of
the
officers
who
testified
made
some
statement
of
one
kind
or
other
in
--
in
implying
that
he
had
made
a
confession,
oral
in
term.
but
we
could
not
find
any
specific
reference
in
the
record
of
the
trial
that
i
examined
to
sustain
this
contention
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
he
did
--
he
did
say
that.
they
didn't
use
it.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
it
varies
great
deal.
in
fact,
at
this
hearing,
mr.
myer
had
testified
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
on
behalf
of
the
state
in
defense
of
the
petition
of
habeas
corpus.
his
testimony
in
this
case
contradicts
his
--
his
affidavit
that
he
filed
in
behalf
of
hamer.
his
testimony
here
was
that
he
promised
hamer
that
he
would
intercede
with
the
law
enforcing
authorities
if
he
were
satisfied,
eventually,
that
he
was
telling
the
truth.
well,
i
have
a
little
difficulty
following
all
that
except
to
agree
with
your
honor
that
his
testimony
here
contradicts
his
affidavit.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor,
it
was
an
affidavit.
it
--
the
--
the
sworn
part
of
the
affidavit
appears
on
page
20
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
24,
his
affidavit,
you
see,
in
support
of
the
--
of
his
petition
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
--
appears
on
page
24
of
the
record
and
sworn
to
him
--
by
him.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
my
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
thank
you.
i
wish
to
reserve
10-minute,
if
your
honor
please,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
answer
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
fate
of
hamer.
when
we
appeared
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
state
was
that
hamer
was
still
in
prison
under
his
199
years
sentence.
i
didn't
want
to
sound
facetious
but
i
thought
it's
proper
to
observe
that
all
that
proved
was
they
were
unfair
both
to
hamer
and
to
napue
that
hamer,
they
told
me,
he's
still
in
the
penitentiary.
now,
mr.
wines
make
some
point
about
the
concessions
and
admissions
by
napue
in
this
case.
i
don't
sole
read
the
record.
hamer
pled
guilty
to
the
crime
in
which
he
was
charged.
this
petitioner
pled
not
guilty,
submitted
his
case
to
a
jury
and
the
record
here
shows
through
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
police
officers
who
testified
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
(inaudible)
that
when
he
was
present
in
court,
napue
took
the
stand
and
testified
and
he
heard
napue,
the
petitioner
here,
testifying
in
his
own
defense.
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
here,
napue
gave
detailed
testimony
explaining
how
he
happened
to
know
hamer
and
explained
it
quite
diametrically
opposed
to
the
version
which
hamer
gave
in
his
prosecution.
he
explained
that
he
was
at
home
with
his
wife
when
hamer
came
there
in
an
automobile
and
someone
told
him
that
is
rumor,
hamer
had
been
wounded
and
he
assisted
this
other
person
in
helping
hamer
because
hamer
was
sent
to
him
to
have
been
wounded.
and
that's
how
he
happened
to
know
of
the
incident
of
hamer
being
wounded.
so
that
his
testimony,
we
must
presume
that
his
testimony
in
the
post-conviction
was
the
same
testimony
gave
in
his
own
defense
at
his
trial.
he
--
he
denied
that
he
was
a
participant
in
this
crime.
he
pled
not
guilty.
he
submitted
his
case
to
the
jury.
and
in
his
post-conviction
case,
he
gave
detailed
denials
of
his
participation
in
this
crime.
and
he
claims
in
his
testimony
and
in
his
affidavit
that
not
only
was
hamer
aligned
with
regard
to
this
promise,
and
his
point
is
this.
that
had
hamer
testified
truthfully,
then
his
lawyer
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
revealed
to
the
jury
that
this
man
is
giving
this
testimony
not
because
he's
telling
the
truth
but
because
he's
hoping
that
his
199
years
would
be
reduced,
and
it's
a
very
important
principle
of
law.
in
people
versus
savvides,
i
think
the
best
proof
that
i
have
or
the
best
case
that
we
can
find
in
this
country,
and
i
concede
that
it
was
not
a
case
construing
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
was
the
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
ruled
that
the
duty
of
the
prosecutor
whose
witnesses
lie
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
is
to
speak
up
immediately
and
tell
the
court
and
jury,
"my
witness
is
lying."
that's
the
duty
of
the
prosecutor.
that's
the
tenor
of
a
fair
trial
before
one
of
our
state
courts
or
jury.
otherwise,
due
process
doesn't
mean
what
we
think
it
means.
and
this
petitioner
said
that
when
hamer
lied
about
a
public
defender
and
he
knew
maury
myer
from
a
public
defender.
why?
because
he
had
seen
maury
myer
in
the
penitentiary.
he
knew
that
maury
myer
was
not
a
public
defendant.
and
hamer
was
trued
enough
to
know
that
by
same
public
defendant,
he
was
creating
an
impression,
which
was
not
only
misleading
but
basically
untrue.
he
gave
the
impression
to
that
jury
that
a
public
defender
who
couldn't
help
him
was
--
made
a
promise
of
recommending
leniency
which
he
couldn't
make.
and
the
man
who
recommended
--
who
--
who
told
him
that
was
the
man
who
was
standing
before
the
jury,
eliciting
from
him
a
false
bit
of
testimony
which,
if
revealed,
would
have
lead
the
--
the
way
to
the
truth
to
being
shown
to
that
jury.
and
inherent
in
this
due
process
question
is
the
duty
of
the
prosecutor,
an
indispensable
part
of
a
trial
and
living
up
to
the
finest
tradition
of
the
bar
when
a
witness
of
his
tells
a
lie,
to
speak
up
promptly
and
reveal
that
fact
to
court
and
jury
and
accord
to
the
man
before
the
bench
and
bar
a
fair
trial.
thank
you.
