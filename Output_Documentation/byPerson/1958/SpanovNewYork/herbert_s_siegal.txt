mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
vincent
joseph
spano,
was
convicted
of
a
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
the
county
court,
bronx
county,
new
york,
was
sentenced
to
death.
the
sentence
has
been
stayed.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
honorable
court
on
the
15th
day
of
december,
1958.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction
by
a
vote
of
4-to-3.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
briefly
the
facts
are
these.
on
january
22nd,
1957,
the
petitioner,
vincent
joseph
spano,
was
in
a
bar
and
grill
and
had
a
$10-bill
on
the
counter
when
the
deceased,
one
frank
palermo
walked
in
and
took
the
bill
off
the
counter
and
walked
out
of
the
bar.
vincent
joseph
spano
walked
out
after
him,
an
argument
started
and
frank
palermo,
a
former
professional
fighter
gave
the
petitioner
spano
a
most
vicious
beating,
punching
him
down
to
the
ground
and
kicking
him
in
the
head,
leaving
him
in
a
dazed
and
bloody
condition.
he
became
violently
sick
immediately,
vomited
right
in
front
of
him,
was
taken
into
the
bar.
someone
there
washed
his
bruises.
he
went
home,
walked
home,
came
back
and
went
to
the
candy
store
that
he
was
directed
to
go
to
by
palermo.
when
palermo
gave
spano
this
beating
he
said,
“this
isn't
all.
bring
the
rest
of
the
money
to
this
candy
store,”
designating
a
certain
candy
store.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
he
had
made
a
demand
for
certain
money
and
all
he
had
gotten,
sir,
was
$10
off
the
bar.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
not
that
he
owed
it.
we
contend,
sir,
that
it
was
a
matter
of
tribute,
was
a
matter
of
extortion.
palermo
directed
spano
to
go
to
this
designated
candy
store.
that
to
anyone
in
that
neighborhood,
amongst
those
people,
was
known
as
the
headquarters
of
palermo
and
when
spano
got
in
there,
as
the
evidence
shows,
three
gangsters
were
in
the
place
besides
palermo.
spano
had
gone
home
in
his
dazed
condition,
had
gotten
a
gun,
had
walked
to
the
candy
store
and
at
first
fired
a
volley
of
two
shots
up
near
the
top
of
the
ceiling,
no
where's
near
or
in
the
direction
of
palermo.
the
evidence
shows
that
at
that
time,
as
the
petitioner
stated
the
door
behind
him
closed
or
opened
and
he
felt
someone
running
towards
him
from
behind,
the
three
in
the
store
closing
in
on
him
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
he
fired
a
volley
of
three
shots
and
killed
palermo.
he
then,
as
the
evidence
showed,
left
the
scene
and
was
missing
for
a
period
of
about
i
believe
it
was
10
days
or
two
weeks,
something
of
that
order.
it
then
developed
that
spano
got
in
touch
with
an
attorney
named
tobias
russo,
a
well-known
lawyer
in
bronx
and
arranged
for
mr.
russo
to
surrender
to
the
authorities.
in
the
meantime
before
the
surrender,
the
district
attorney
of
bronx
county
had
presented
the
evidence
that
they
had
before
the
grand
jury
of
bronx
county
and
obtained
an
indictment
charging
this
defendant
with
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
there
was
one
other.
there
was
one
eyewitness,
sir,
a
young
boy
i
think
14
or
15
years
of
age.
the
attorney,
mr.
russo
made
arrangements
with
the
district
attorney,
met
the
district
attorney
in
the
street
in
front
of
the
county
court
house
at
or
about
7:30
p.m.
and
there
turned
over,
the
petitioner
spano
to
the
district
attorney,
personal
assistant
district
attorney,
goldsmith
and
the
county
detective
and
then
left.
the
testimony
shows
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
the
police
talked
the
petitioner
to
a
district
attorney's
office.
this
was
about
7:30
or
quarter
to
8
p.m.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
sir?
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
it
was
a
bench
warrant
notwithstanding,
when
the
indictment
was
filed
by
the
grand
jury
and
accepted
by
the
court
a
bench
warrant
was
issued.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
i
would
--
i
would
say.
he
was
surrendered
pursuant
to
the
bench
warrant
and
indictment.
the
assistant
district
attorney
interrogate
or
attempted
to
interrogate
spano
from
7:30
until
12,
or
12
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
during
all
that
time,
spano
said,
“i
want
my
attorney.”
the
district
attorney
knew
he
had
an
attorney
because
only
a
few
moments
ago
he
had
been
surrendered
by
his
attorney
upon
arrangement.
the
district
attorney,
nevertheless,
knowing
that
he
had
an
attorney
and
being
told
by
spano,
“i
have
been
advised
not
to
make
any
statement
except
to
give
you
my
name.
i
want
to
consult
with
my
attorney.”
nevertheless,
they
continued
to
interrogate
and
interrogate.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
no,
sir,
not
a
word,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
not
to
the
district
attorney.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
only
to
his
client.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
sir?
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
the
bench
warrant,
reads
as
follows,
sir.
“you
are
therefore
commanded
forthwith
to
arrest
the
above
name
and
bring
him
before
that
court
to
answer
the
indictment
or
if
the
courts
have
adjourned
for
the
term
that
you
deliver
him
into
the
custody
of
a
sheriff
of
the
county
of
or
in
the
city
of
new
york
to
the
warden
of
the
city
prison
of
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
they
didn't
take
him
and
put
him
into
the
city
prison.
they
took
him
into
the
district
attorney's
office,
sir,
and
questioned
him
until
12:30
and
when
they
saw
at
12:30
in
the
morning
that
he's
still
persistent,
that
he
--
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
the
court
was
open,
sir,
but
may
i
say
this,
sir.
the
district
attorney
is
present
as
a
custom
in
the
bronx
that
when
a
man
is
arrested
on
a
warrant
after
indictment,
no
matter
what
time,
he
is
brought
before
a
county
judge
even
if
it's
at
his
home
because
they
all
live
right
there
in
the
neighborhood.
there
wasn't
any
--
any
trouble
at
all
about
getting
a
judge
if
they
wanted
him
at
that
hour.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
that
is
right,
the
time
was
not
called.
they
were
actually
sitting.
they
were
going
to
sit
the
next
morning
at
10
o'clock.
now,
sir,
after,
12:30,
they
saw
they
couldn't
get
anywhere,
they
took
the
petitioner
up
to
the
squad
room
of
a
police
station
and
there
continued
to
interrogate
him
and
he
there
again,
asked
for
his
attorney,
time
and
time
again.
at
time,
one
of
the
police
officers
testified
that
he
couldn't
find
the
--
a
lawyer
with
the
said
name
or
telephone
number
in
the
telephone
book.
at
any
rate,
he
never
got
an
attorney.
at
any
rate,
during
that
time,
the
district
attorney
and
the
police
sent
a
police
officer
named
bruno,
who
was
a
friend
of
spano
and
to
spano
a
number
of
times,
to
tell
him
that
he,
bruno,
was
in
trouble
if
he
didn't
make
--
if
spano
didn't
make
a
statement
in
this
case,
that
his
wife
was
going
to
have
another
child.
he
might
lose
his
job.
and
he
insisted
that
he
make
a
statement.
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
while
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
was
out
before
he
arranged
for
the
surrender,
he
called
his
friend
bruno
and
told
him
what
had
happened
and
said
that
palermo
had
been
on
his
back
and
had
given
him
a
bad
beating
and
that
he
was
dazed
and
so
forth
that
he
killed
him
and
he
wanted
advice,
that
he
was
going
to
get
a
lawyer.
so
now,
they
use
this
same
friend,
bruno,
to
coerce
spano
into
making
a
statement.
they
used
him
for
the
purpose
of
having
him
disregard,
if
they
could,
the
advice
and
instructions
of
his
attorney.
the
district
attorney
all
of
the
time
knew
that
this
man
was
represented
by
an
attorney,
knew
that
there
had
been
an
indictment,
knew
that
there
was
a
judicial
proceeding
pending,
yet
nevertheless,
continued
to
interrogate
and
interrogate
until
sometime
around
3:30
a.m.,
after
bruno
had
left
spano
for
a
few
minutes,
spano
said,
“all
right,
let
me
make
a
statement.”
they
called
in
a
stenographer
and
they
got
a
statement.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
what
we
--
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
my
best
opinion,
sir,
that
the
undisputed
testimony
is
that
it
occurred
between
7:30
and
12:30,
then
--
that
might
have
taken
a
half
hour
to
get
to
the
squad
room
and
then
from
about
1
to
3:30
the
next
morning.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
that's
in
the
district
attorney's
office.
then
they
took
him
up
to
the
squad
room
and
they
went
to
--
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
they
say
they
gave
him
a
cup
of
coffee
or
they
gave
him
a
sandwich
or
something
during
that
--
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
--
time.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
testimony
was
that
they
went
in
and
out
three
ways.
those
three
police
officers.
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
there
all
the
time.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
mr.
goldsmith,
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
the
police
officers.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
the
stenographer
was
only
present,
sir,
at
about
3:30
when
they
asked
him
to
come
in.
there
was
evidence
of
a
case
of
a
beating
but
i
am
not
arguing
that
point
now
because
that
was
denied
and
it's
not
--
it's
a
disputed
of
fact.
it's
not
an
undisputed
fact.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
i
would
say
in
all
about
--
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
--
half
hour.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
3
o'clock,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
the
exact
time,
sir,
is
3:20
a.m.
to
3:30
a.m.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
prior,
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
judicial
proceeding
pending
at
the
time,
when
the
bench
warrant
was
issued.
he
was
surrendered
pursuant
to
the
indictment
of
the
bench
warrant.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
that's
right,
sir.
he
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
meditation
and
deliberation.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
he
has
been
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
there
was,
sir,
throughout
the
record
but
it
is
not
an
undisputed
fact.
they
--
the
police
officers
denied
it
and
for
that
reason
i
refrain
from
arguing
it
here.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
over
objection,
the
admissibility
went
to
the
jury
but
not
on
the
question
of
the
absence
of
counsel
or
the
demand
for
counsel.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
absence
--
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
absence
of
counsel,
sir,
plus
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
indictment,
plus
the
fact
that
there
was
a
bench
warrant
issue,
plus
the
fact
that
there
was
a
judicial
proceeding
in
being
plus
all
of
the
other
circumstances.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
in
--
in
that
light,
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
it's
a
coerced
confession.
may
i
say
this.
it's
a
coerced
confession
in
the
--
in
the
sense
or
in
the
language
of
judge
desmond
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
and
may
i
answer
this
way,
sir?
well,
judge
desmond
said
this,
“usually,
of
course,
the
test
for
admissibility
of
a
confession
is
voluntariness
and
usually
voluntariness
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.”
but
one
of
the
senses
in
which
the
courts
used
voluntary,
a
confession
or
incriminating
testimony
taken
from
a
defendant
without
warranting
of
his
rights,
during
the
progress
of
a
criminal
cause
against
them
is
not
voluntary
since
in
such
a
case
the
fact
is
undisputed.
the
question
is
not
one
for
the
jury
but
a
constitutional
question
of
due
process,
an
undisputed
fact.
some
violations
of
rights,
are
too
fundamental
to
be
excused
by
a
jury
or
layman,
directly
and
frankly
violated
here
with
two
such
rights,
the
right
to
have
the
advice
of
lawyer
at
every
stage
of
a
court
proceeding
and
the
right
not
to
be
forced
to
testify
against
oneself
during
such
a
proceeding.
now,
may
it
please
this
court,
i'd
like
to
read
just
a
bit
further
from
judge
desmond's
opinion.
now,
we
accept
as
evidence
a
confession
extracted
during
the
very
course
of
a
judicial
proceeding
after
indictment
and
surrender
on
a
bench
warrant.
when
the
time
for
investigation
has
passed
and
when
the
prisoner
no
longer
is
a
suspect,
but
now
a
defendant
held
on
the
court
process
awaiting
trial
has
retained
counsel
who
has
warned
him
not
to
give
evidence
to
the
public
authorities.
a
citizen
learning
that
he
has
been
indicted
and
that
a
bench
warrant
is
outstanding
against
him
consults
an
attorney.
the
attorney
confirming
strictly
to
his
professional
duty
instructs
his
client
forthwith
to
surrender,
arranges
for
surrender
to
the
representatives
of
the
district
attorney's
office.
the
lawyer
accompanies
his
client
to
the
place
of
surrender,
warns
him
not
to
make
any
statement
then
leaves
his
client
in
the
custody
of
the
officers
justifiably
confident
that
the
client's
rights
are
safely
under
the
protection
of
the
court
and
all
of
its
mandate.
the
prosecutor
in
his
brief
on
this
appeal
reminds
us
that
spano's
attorney
could
have
waited
until
10
o'clock
the
next
morning
and
surrendered
his
client
to
the
county
court.
of
course,
he
could
but
as
we
shall
show
defendant's
rights
and
immunity
would
be
no
different
since
whether
at
7
p.m.
or
10
a.m.
the
surrender
was
to
the
court
in
obedience
to
the
process.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
i
don't
--
if
he
had
no
lawyer?
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
i
think
the
situation
would
have
been
the
same
if
he
demanded
a
lawyer,
if
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
so
long
as
there
was
a
judicial
proceeding
in
there.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
the
confession
was
involuntary
because
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
counsel
during
a
judicial
proceeding.
we
submit
most
respectfully
that
there
was
a
judicial
proceeding.
this
was
a
--
at
a
pretrial
stage.
he
was
entitled
to
a
counsel
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
not
in
that
sense
if
we're
talking
about
physical
coercion.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
but
this
court
--
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
not
of
those
elements
separately
but
this
court
has
held
i
believe
in
the
crooker
case
that
although
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
due
process
to
deprive
a
defendant
of
counsel
but
that
was
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
a
--
that
was
at
the
time
of
arrest
before
there
was
an
indictment.
and
this
court
held
i
believe
that
to
say
that
the
deprivation
of
counsel
in
such
a
stage
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
would
hamstring
the
authorities.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
question
and
we
draw
that
distinction
if
we
may.
we
say
they
have
investigated
the
petitioners'
no
more
a
suspect,
he
is
now
a
defendant.
there
is
a
formal
accusation
against
him.
it's
pending
in
the
court.
he
surrenders
pursuant
to
that
bench
warrant.
therefore,
at
that
time,
at
the
moment
of
the
filing
of
the
indictment,
two
things
happen.
number
one,
he
has
an
obligation
to
defend
and
number
two
he
has
the
right
to
attack
and
at
that
moment,
he
certainly
could
come
into
court.
he
is
in
court.
there
is
a
judicial
proceeding
and
he
could
make
any
kind
of
a
motion
that
he
wanted
at
that
moment.
he
is
certainly
--
is
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
no
superseding
indictment.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
it
wouldn't
change.
it
would
be
a
violation
i
would
say
of
due
process.
i
don't
think
if
either
the
judge
or
the
district
attorney
or
anybody
else
has
the
right
to
question
the
defendant
after
the
indictment.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well
(voice
overlap)
it
might
raise
some
other
questions
before
indictment.
it
might
raise
some
other
questions.
but
if
it
was
a
formal
charge
laid
against
the
defendant,
i
still
believe
that
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
on
his
demand
for
a
counsel.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
i
would
say,
sir,
definitely.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
i
would
say,
sir.
i
would
say
that
in
this
case
if
the
attorney
or
the
petitioner
had
been
sitting
in
the
courtroom
with
the
petitioner
at
five
minutes
to
ten
waiting
for
the
petitioner
to
be
arraigned
and
before
the
clerk
of
the
court
had
an
opportunity
to
call
the
petitioner
for
arraignment,
the
district
attorney
or
the
police
had
snatched
the
petitioner
out
of
the
courtroom,
and
taken
him
into
a
side
room
outside
of
the
hearing
and
presence
of
the
defendant
and
question
him,
that
certainly
would
have
been
a
violation
of
due
process
and
the
district
attorney's
contention
that
he
had
a
right
to
question
because
it
was
before
arraignment,
we
respectfully
submit
has
no
merit
because
they
certainly
cannot
delay
arraignments
and
say
that
because
the
physical
act
of
arraignment
didn't
take
place,
they
have
a
right
to
question.
we
submit
most
respectfully
to
this
court
that
from
the
moment
of
that
indictment
that
defendant
was
in
court
when
he
surrendered
pursuant
to
the
bench
warrant
he
was
in
court.
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
that
his
persistent
demands
throughout
the
seven
or
eight
hours
of
interrogation
that
he
wanted
a
counsel
was
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
now,
we
most
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
conviction
and
sentence
of
death.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
merely
under
our
law
of
voluntariness
in
the
sense
of
physical
coercion,
not
on
the
question
of
the
absence
of
counsel
and
not
on
--
after
indictment
and
not
on
the
question
of
a
failure
to
advise
the
petitioner
of
his
rights
not
to
answer
after
indictment,
merely
on
the
question
of
whether
it
was
coercion
due
to
physical
beatings.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
well,
they've
gone
as
far
as
psychological
beating.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
but
the
element
of
the
absence
of
counsel
was
not
included.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
s.
siegal
yes,
thank
you.
