chief
justice
earl
warren
and
bruno
was
told
--
and
bruno
was
told
to
play
on
his
sympathy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you're
going
to
say
that
anything
--
any
other
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
something
you
--
you
used
those
words
to
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
lawyer
listed
in
the
telephone
booklet?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
for
how
many
hours
after
--
after
the
district
attorney
and
the
police
know
that
a
man
has
--
has
a
lawyer
and
know
who
he
is
and
--
and
the
defendant
has
protested
that
his
lawyer
has
told
him
not
to
talk
and
he
doesn't
want
to
talk.
for
how
many
hours
can
they
question
him
in
order
to
overcome
his
will
in
that
regard
and
get
the
statement
that
they
desire?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
they
have
continued
to
--
to
interrogate
him
all
night
long
and
then
brought
him
in
at
10
o'clock
with
the
same
result?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
i
mean
if
they
had
done
--
if
they
had
done
it,
the
situation
would
be
the
same
as
far
as
you
can
see
as
long
as
they
arraigned
him
on
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
he
was
protesting
from
--
from
that
time
on
until
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
that
he
didn't
want
to
talk,
that
his
--
his
counsel
had
advised
him,
not
to
him,
that
he
wanted
to
see
his
lawyer
and
so
forth.
chief
justice

yes.

how
many
should
he
have
to
do
when
people
are
coming
in
and
going
out
of
the
room?
should
he
have
to
look
at
every
man
and
tell
him
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
specifically
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
not
sufficient
for
him
to
--
to
say
to
whoever
is
in
charge
of
questioning
him
that
his
lawyer
has
advised
him
not
to
talk.
that
he
doesn't
propose
to
talk
and
--
and
the
client
should
do
it.
and
then
for
four
or
five
hours,
he
--
he
declines
to
make
a
statement
for
that
reason.
does
he
have
to
be
meticulous
about
seeing
that
he
made
the
same
statement
to
every
single
one
chief

warren
--
of
the
people?
chief
justice
earl
