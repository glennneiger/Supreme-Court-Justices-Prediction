justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
were
the
lengths
of
time
of
continuous
questioning
undisputedly
not
--
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
had
given
answer
to
which
the
district
--
which
the
--
which
the
district
attorney
will
have
--
the
district
attorney
will
have
to
agree.
that's
what
i
mean
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
7:30
to
12:30?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
during
those
--
those
four
hours
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
questioning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
continuous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
people
were
in
the
room
at
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
did
the
questioning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
stenographer
present
or
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
the
interruption
after
(inaudible)
which
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
lasted
until
3
o'clock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
3
o'clock.
and
then
was
the
stenographer
called
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
you
can
think
the
case
would
have
been
different
that
the
same
questioning,
for
the
same
duration
under
or
the
statement
you
raised
on
certain
circumstances
at
the
same
time
by
the
same
personnel
had
been
carried
on
and
a
confession
then
secured
that
spano
have
had
no
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
advised
that
the
didn't
have
a
lawyer
or
that
he
was
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
which
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
questioning
itself
do
you
think
was
not
--
did
not
deprive
the
confession
from
being
voluntary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
hasn't
restricted
coercion,
or
physical
coercion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
hasn't
held
that
you
require
a
beating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
couldn't
be
the
law
of
new
york
any
longer
(inaudible)
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
has
not
so
restricted
the
requirement
of
the
due
process
clause.
i
do
not
believe
that
your
court
would
say
no
matter
what
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
had
said,
“we
restrict
voluntariness
to
physical
beatings.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
from
varying
opinions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
i
don't
quite
understand
what
that
word
means.
in
fact
they
are
not
now
seriously
challenged
(inaudible)
opinion
because
judge
desmond
says
that
the
same
defendant,
the
same
criminal
case
held
under
(inaudible)
same
court
can
be
subjected
to
secret
midnight
questioning
out
of
the
reach
of
any
lawyer
until
he
confesses.
now,
to
be
--
believe
the
(inaudible)
is
held
for
questioning
until
he
confesses.
why
shouldn't
in
the
ordinary
mode
of
speaking
called
that
a
voluntary
confession
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
held
subsequent
questioning
until
he
confesses
that
means
that
not
his
will
but
somebody
else's
will
was
operating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
the
vision
of
opinion
was
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
one
cannot
say
it's
completed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you
were
quite
within
the
--
the
accurate
quotation
what
judge
fuld
said.
my
(inaudible)
is
not
with
you
--
over
you,
but
over
judge
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
anolik.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
people
who
aren't
content
to
rest
on
that
confession
to
his
childhood
friend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
thought
it
was
necessary
to
introduce
this
other
confession
(voice
overlap).
that
confession
in
the
context
of
the
circumstances
that
gave
rise
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
he
was
(inaudible)
already
a
defendant
in
any
--
the
technical
sense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
haven't
read
the
(inaudible)
case
but
what
judge
desmond
says
about
it,
there
was
a
distinction
of
it
(inaudible)
by
the
court
of
appeals
between
a
person
who
became
a
material
witness
who
at
the
time
he
was
questioned
was
not
yet
an
accused
or
a
defendant,
was
merely
a
witness.
and
in
this
case,
where
the
choice
was
made,
that
this
wasn't
an
inquiry
by
the
police
to
ascertain
the
guilt
of
the
party,
the
district
attorney
had
already
committed
himself
in
making
the
accusation
--
i
mean
made
the
accusations
against
this
person.
although
you're
quite
right
in
saying
this
wasn't
the
traditional
inquiry.
there's
another
way
of
saying
the
district
attorney
is
in
the
court
but
he
was
already
in
the
status
of
that
of
a
defendant
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
depends
what
you
mean
by
talking
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
then
what
do
you
mean
by
interrogating?
what's
the
circumstances
were
under
which
there
was
initiated
a
confession
reserved
to
convict
the
man?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
the
outset,
you
take
concern
on
the
circumstances
under
which
as
in
this
case,
one
already
under
indictment,
it
detained
by
the
prosecutor.
you
have
series
of
questions
extending
over
a
given
time
with
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
is
that
so
clearly
within
or
without
the
decision
of
this
court
if
a
state
can
be,
admissions,
confessions
by
the
defendant
not
voluntarily
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
indicted
to
the
--
that
is
--
none
of
things
are
(inaudible)
question,
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
process
by
which
this
confession
was
obtained?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
judge
desmond
is
right,
that
judge
desmond
is
right
that
the
--
that
the
record
sustained
his
conclusion
that
he
was
detained
and
questioned
until
he
confess
and
i'd
like
you
to
repeat
that
it
was
not
gismo
but
another
person
will
determine
to
(inaudible)
of
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
not
--
we're
not
here
called
upon
to
consider
whether
what
he
told
his
childhood
friend
was
a
voluntary
explosion
of
expression
(inaudible)
i
don't
see
how
that's
material
even
though
they
were
(inaudible)
is
the
formal,
repeated
taking
down
stenographically
authenticated
testimony
or
statements
that
he
made
if
that
repetition
if
you
will,
for
purposes
of
(inaudible)
more
assured
conviction
of
him.
if
that
second
statement
was
under
conditions
that
debar
the
conclusion
as
a
matter
of
law
this
is
voluntary,
it
doesn't
help
me
to
have
a
prior
statement
that
was
voluntary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
frequent
to
countless
arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
is
controlling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
is
if
you're
not
controlled
by
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
it
appear
from
the
record?
mr.
siegal
said
that
the
--
the
interrogation
whatever
you
should
make
it
lasted
between
(inaudible)
to
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
challenge
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
give
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
if
we
want
to
reach
the
record
for
(inaudible)
of
the
--
what
took
place
that
justified
with
the
trial
that
an
interrogation
in
the
district
attorney's
office
one
at
a
time
that
it
isn't
from
07:30
to
12:30
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
the
time
that
it
wasn't
persistent.
one
would
find
that
on
the
whole
if
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
it
was
casual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
preoccupation
was
in
a
total
to
you
to
getting
him
to
just
make
a
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
just
--
what
--
what
would
it
be?
did
they
discuss
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
they
talk
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
your
reading
of
the
record,
how
many
hours
is
that
transaction
in
the
district
attorney's
office
to
take
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
can't
be
four
hours,
three
and
a
half
hours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
testimony
at
the
trial
in
regard
to
what
took
place
during
those
hours
between
7:30
until
3
whatever
the
intermission
(inaudible)
that
the
preoccupation
of
the
questioning
related
to
the
transaction
between
other
than
this
unfortunate
murder.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
saying
if
we
had
nothing
but
that
that
this
would
not
fall
in
within
--
that
this
would
not
satisfy,
or
this
would
not
be
condemnable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
light
of
our
case
here,
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
reversed
on
what
the
record
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
say
so
that
then
from
your
point
of
view,
there
are
really
two
questions
in
this
case.
one,
judged
by
the
criteria
of
our
decisions,
for
this
--
on
this
side
or
on
the
other
side
for
inadmissible
confession
under
the
due
process
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
number
two,
if
this
was
a
capital
case
then
he
is
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer.
that
means
at
some
stage
and
for
some
purpose
number
two,
order
the
trial
with
that
protection
of
the
due
process
clause
the
protection
of
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
desmond's
opinion
indicates
one
consideration
on
restraints
namely
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case
in
your
court
in
the
court
of
appeals,
namely,
where
a
man
is
detained
as
a
witness,
he
does
not
know
and
has
no
reason
to
know
or
believe
that
his
state
is
that
of
an
accused
with
all
the
difference
that
that
make
in
the
witness
of
an
accused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
that
may
be
a
fact
which
in
the
totality
of
the
situation
makes
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
asked
that
question
merely
because
if
a
man
goes
in
and
talks
to
him
about,
he
happened
to
be
a
very
literate
or
literate
person,
we
discuss
(inaudible)
problem
and
that's
the
reason
of
indictment,
wouldn't
not
make
or
that
make
--
that
make
an
involuntary
confession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
a
witness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
a
witness,
clearly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
not
an
accused,
he
did
not
--
he
did
not
stand
in
the
position
of
a
man
over
whom
the
(inaudible)
sought
of
a
conviction
for
murder
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
upon
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
that,
when
--
when
i
ask
you,
when
a
lawyer
surrenders
a
client,
charged
with
murder
i
suppose
that
that
means
nothing
more
than
murder
is
not
a
bailable
offense
i
assume
in
new
york.
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
he
surrendered
him
because
his
--
his
client
was
not
--
he
can't
get
bail
and
there
he
simply
says
he
has
surrendered
his
body
completely
should
be
put
in
jail.
but
what
consequences
follow
the
surrender?
what
indications
are
there
beyond
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
he
not
bailable
and
he
doesn't
want
to
escape,
he
doesn't
want
to
be
a
fugitive
and
he
assessed
it
that
way,
surrendered
him.
that's
all
it
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assumedly.
may
i
involve
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
mean
go
ahead
and
pressure
him
all
you
please
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
meant
for
a
clause
by
that
kind
of
analogy
for
our
petitioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
anolik,
in
your
brief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
just
scanned
isn't
it
that
the
uncontradicted
evidence
clearly
revealed
that
petitioner's
confession
was
completely
voluntary.
that
is
your
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
here.
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
--
as
it
was
authenticate
that.
you
simply
almost
take
it
for
granted
and
you
rely
talking
on
what
justice
brennan
said.
but
clearly
it
seems
to
me
that,
that's
a
vital
part
of
the
case
--
that's
on
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
this
--
if
this
confession,
lawyer
or
no
lawyer,
murder
or
no
murder
was
voluntary,
even
legal,
constitutional
the
fourteenth
amendment
said,
is
that
qualified?
that
that
is
the
only
other
problem
is
the
denial
of
access
to
his
lawyer
(inaudible)
but
you
sort
of
take
that
for
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
binding
on
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
that
document
points
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
had
case
after
case
in
which
the
court
and
jury
left
and
if
the
court
left
an
issue
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
resolved
it
against
people,
state
in
favor
the
defendant
and
this
court
has
said
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
an
issue
that
determinable
by
a
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
right
on
the
record
but
it
turns
on
what
the
testimony
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
and
--
and
as
you
say
he
didn't
the
stand.
cross-examination
also
matters
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
court
has
brought
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
ones
really
would
to
have
read,
i
don't
know
how
many
pages
of
testimony
to
say
whether
it's
a
matter
of
law.
this
was
a
punishable
issue
and
the
jury
could
so
find,
if
it
could
so
find
and
it
did
so
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
the
jury
so
find
--
found
as
needed
it
could
have
sought
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
that
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1833
to
2022?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
who
were
the
people
who
were
summoned
under
voir
dire?
the
policemen
or
the
district
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
assistant
district
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
people
to
--
to
ascertain
the
circumstances
under
which
this
questioning
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
nub
--
at
least
for
me,
the
nub
of
the
problem
is
that
one
(inaudible)
to
judge
desmond
being
independent
in
the
case
--
criminal
case
held
under
the
process
of
the
same
court
can
--
it
is
now
decided
being
subjected
to
secret
midnight
questioning
out
of
reach
of
any
lawyer
until
he
confessed
it.
now,
if
that
is
the
--
if
the
record
sustained
that
characterization
by
judge
desmond
it
is
one
thing
because
this
judgment
is
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
rely
on
that
--
i'm
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
exclusively.
it
doesn't
matter
exclusively
if
--
if
--
and
this
had
been
--
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
a
district
attorney
try
to
over
proved
his
case.
that's
not
unfamiliar
to
anybody
who's
been
in
district
attorney's
office
or
outside
of
it.
if
in
fact,
although
you
have
all
the
evidence
that
was
necessary
for
conviction,
who
seal
of
all
enterprise
are
one
it
was
sort
to
get
them
all
formal
and
more
detailed
confession
under
circumstances
characterized
by
what
i
have
read
from
judge
desmond
then
that
confession
is
not
admissible
under
our
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
terms
on
to
exact
facts
of
circumstances
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
statement
who
is
this
childhood
friend?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
district
attorney
didn't
need
tell
further
evidence
to
fill
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
have
(inaudible)
the
district
attorney
must
have
thought
it
was
relevant
to
get
those
items
cleared
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
partly,
i
suppose
it
might
have
been
a
self-defense
--
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
have
been
that?
so,
if
there
were
items
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
it's
cumulatively
or
independently
necessary
that
the
district
attorney
thought
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
but
--
lawyers
have
to
make
judgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
what
is
necessary
or
desirable
for
the
success
of
the
particular
side
that
needs
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
--
if
there
haven't
been
the
district
attorney
but
merely
police
officers
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
agree
that
he
was
in
the
control
of
the
police
and
the
prosecutor,
uninterrupted.
i'm
not
now
saying
what
took
place
but
he
was
in
the
control
of
the
police
and
the
prosecutors
from
7:30
to
3:00
when
his
confession
was
taken
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
up
to
that
time
the
district
attorney's
inquiry
had
elicited
the
information
to
fill
in
what
you
called
a
hiatus,
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
anolik,
i
now
have
these
three
verse
of
arguments,
could
you
without
wasting
your
time
give
me
a
reference
to
the
page
where
bruno's
testimony
is
to
be
found,
could
you
do
that
for
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
2250.
thank
you
very
much.
when
was
this
crime
committed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
was
the
trial?
how
(inaudible)
when
was
the
trial
--
it's
been
known
to
you.
this
must
have
been
a
quick
trial.
he
was
a
--
have
been
in
the
member
(inaudible)
over
five
months.
he
was
a
very
--
very
much
of
a
rookie,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
dealt
with
the
problem
which
for
you
seems
to
be
crucial
in
this
case
namely,
assuming
you're
right
about
everything
concerning
the
confession.
what
about
the
fact
that
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
didn't
get
one?did
he
ask
to
see
his
lawyer
or
did
he
--
didn't
have
access
to
his
lawyer.
what
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
very
important.
this
is
a
murder
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
a
(inaudible)
all
the
more
reason
for
seeing
that
he
has
the
protection
of
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
only
should
be
incarcerated
but
he
couldn't
be
allowed
out
on
bail.
was
there
any
other
purpose
for
turning
him
over?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
he
have
--
turning
him
over
so
that
he
shouldn't
when
he
asked
to
see
the
lawyer
he
shouldn't
be
--
should
be
disallowed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
from
your
--
your
reading
of
the
record,
what
--
does
the
record
show
as
to
a
demand
by
him
to
see
his
lawyer
to
have
him
present
to
consult
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
denial
of
such
a
request?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
lawyer
a
known
member
of
your
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
might
not
have
known
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
there
be
a
responsibility
in
--
in
having
him
take
steps
so
that
he
would
find
out
where
that
lawyer
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
you
think
that
a
policeman
would
ask
him
--
to
whom
a
--
an
indicted
person
gives
the
name
of
his
lawyer,
who
can't
find
it
in
a
telephone
maybe
because
he
didn't
get
the
spelling
right,
is
absurd
when
taking
no
further
step
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
could
--
if
it's
a
question
of
getting
protection
from
legal
advice,
legal
advice
that
the
--
the
suffering
or
rather
the
hurt,
the
denial
that's
involved
in
his
right
to
get
a
lawyer
reduces
a
state.
every
--
every
police
have
the
--
every
prosecutor
is
part
of
the
state
for
that
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
crooker
case,
this
isn't
the
crooker
case.
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
different
situation.
seeing
the
nature
--
the
individual
had
experienced
--
it
was
almost
that
he
was
a
lawyer
himself
etcetera
--
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
of
having
a
counsel
whether
was
if
it
was
taken.
the
counsel
that
was
--
wasn't
asking
for
a
lawyer.
not
denying
access
to
lawyer,
what
you
have
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
question
there
on
whether
it
was
or
wasn't
a
voluntary
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
one
more
thing.
if
the
lawyer
had
been
present,
the
lawyer
would
have
interposed
his
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
imposed
his
will
on
his
client
as
against
the
attempted
assertion
of
will
by
the
district
attorney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
before
you
sit
down.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
now
that
i
have
cast
my
eye
over
the
pages
of
bruno's
testimony
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
haven't
--
in
my
skimpy
reading
of
it
misread.
in
the
first
place,
there's
testimony
by
him
that
mr.
(inaudible)
came
at
4:00
a.m.
not
3:00
a.m.
as
both
of
you
have
said,
but
much
important
than
that,
he
made
several
efforts
to
get
--
what's
his
name--
spano
as
he
thought,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
spano
stood
his
ground
and
wouldn't
talk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
gannon
sent
him
back
again
and
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
there
was
a
refusal
to
talk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
there
was
an
insistence
by
(inaudible)
friend
bruno
to
get
him
to
talk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
lieutenant
gannon
his
superior,
this
fellow
(inaudible)
he
was
brought
down
from
the
academy,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
he
wasn't
part
of
the
police
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
somewhere
they
found
out
that
he's
a
great
credibility,
they
got
hold
of
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
he
stood
his
ground
at
the
insistence
of
his
boyhood
friend,
he
wouldn't
talk,
several
times
that
he
says
--
and
at
that
time
he
told
lieutenant
gannon
that
they
could
get
no
statement
out
of
this
man,
is
that
right?
i
did
and
you
went
back
into
the
room?
yes.
at
whose
direction?
the
lieutenant
and
come
--
what
it
was
that
he
was
said
(inaudible)
don't
worry
etcetera.
(inaudible)
a
long
course
of
--
or
an
effort
or
rather
serious
continuing
effort
to
have
spano
speak
freely,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
he
did,
he
was
not
forthcoming
until
to
these
--
these
hours
in
which
took
place
what
you've
said
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
finally
at
4:00
in
the
morning
if
i
have
to
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
wouldn't
(inaudible)
about
an
hour
and
a
half.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
course
of
events
by
which
eventually
this
statement
came
to
pass.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
have
just
stated?
