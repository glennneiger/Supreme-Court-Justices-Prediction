mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
at
the
outset,
the
people
respectfully
call
this
court's
attention
to
page
2
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
furnished
by
this
court
where
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
very
clearly,
the
second
full
paragraph.
it
is
clear
in
the
record
and
the
fact
that
not
now
seriously
challenge
that
this
confession
was
neither
physically
nor
psychologically
coerced.
i
think
that
that
is
the
premise
that
must
be
accepted
here
and
i
do
not
believe
that
petitioner
seriously
contradicts
that
fact.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
i
--
i
understand
that
justice
harlan.
i
merely
pointed
that
out
because
of
the
last
remark
just
to
--
there
would
be
no
confusion
on
the
record
on
that
point.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that
in
view
of
their
citation
of
a
number
of
decisions
by
this
court
that
they
had
in
mind
situations
such
as
might
have
been
presented
in
detention
of
a
defend
on
duly
such
as
mallory
against
united
states,
things
that
mcnabb
against
the
united
states
and
situations
where
although
no
physical
beatings
were
promulgated
against
the
person
of
defendant
that
psychologically
such
pressures
that
the
totality
of
conduct
might
have
been
such
that
it
would
have
been
coerced
despite
the
fact
that
no
physical
violence
were
--
were
exerted
against
him.
i
think
that's
probably
what
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the
opinion
of
course
they
--
they
cite
mallory
against
united
states.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
the
--
the
cases
that
they
relied
upon
were
lisenba
against
california,
stroble
against
california,
stein
against
new
york,
and
cases
of
that
sort.
i
submit
that
a
perusal
of
the
record,
justice
black,
will
indicate
that
there
was
no
psychological
coercion
even
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
used
that
term.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i'm
thinking
of
situations
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
don't
recall
that
this
court
has
used
the
term
psychological.
i
was
merely
trying
to
answer
your
question,
justice
black,
as
best
as
i
could
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
in
view
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
may
i
continue?
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
frankfurter,
i
respectfully
submit
that.
that
is
not,
that
justice
--
judge
desmond's
words
do
not
reflect
accurately
what
actually
occurred.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
i
recognize
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
was
merely
quoting
the
language
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
justice
(inaudible)
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
sir.
well,
justice
frankfurter,
justices
of
the
court,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
at
the
--
at
the
--
at
a
period
before
petitioner
had
surrendered,
that
is
about
two
or
three
days
after
the
murder
had
been
perpetrated.
he
telephoned
one,
anthony
napolitano
who
was
one
of
the
owners
of
the
roosevelt
bar
and
tavern
outside
of
which
this
fight
between
the
deceased
and
him
had
occurred
and
he
indicated
to
him
that
i'm
going
to
give
himself
up.
this
was
on
the
telephone
call.
i'm
going
to
get
a
lawyer.
then
on
february
3rd
after
the
indictment
which
took
place
february
1st
incidentally,
but
on
february
3rd
which
was
a
day
before
he
surrendered,
he
telephoned
a
childhood
friend,
a
rookie
patrolman
named,
patrolman
bruno
to
which
my
adversary
has
a
verdict
and
said
to
him
on
the
telephone,
in
effect,
that
i
shot
at
the
deceased.
he
admitted
the
shooting
of
perlemo
and
he
did
not
give
as
much
detail
but
there
was
no
question
from
the
conversation
that
there
was
a
completed
mission
that
he
had
shot
perlemo
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
at
page
60
of
the
brief
there,
the
--
the
defendant
in
that
court,
petitioner
here
admits
that
there's
no
question
that
he
shot
perlemo
and
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
justice?
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
true.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
recognize
that,
justice
frankfurter.
and
if
i
may,
when
he
was
surrendered
at
about
07:15
or
7:30
p.m.
on
the
4th,
there
was
no
judicial
proceeding
as
such
upon
the
indictment
at
that
point.
this
questioning
was
not
a
judicial
proceeding,
it
was
the
questioning
that
might
take
place
when
any
accused,
because
we
must
recognize
that
an
indictment
is
nothing
more
than
an
accusation.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
bench
warrant
--
mr.
irving
anolik
a
perusal
of
that
warrant,
justice
brennan,
indicates
that
it
said
that
if
the
court
had
adjourned
for
the
term,
it
was
to
be
--
the
petitioner
was
to
be
delivered
to
the
warden
of
city
prison.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
it
had
merely
recessed
for
the
day.
that
court
was
still
in
session.
it
had
not
adjourned
for
the
term
and
consequently
it
was
well
defended.
the
provisions
of
that
bench
warrant
not
to
deliver
him
to
a
warden
of
the
city
prison.
now,
this
defendant
was
not
questioned
insistently
as
a
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
it
didn't
necessarily
authorize
or
forbid
this
sort
of
interrogation.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
a
synopsis
of
the
bench
warrant
appears
on
page
2
of
the
respondent's
brief,
new
york
code
of
crim.
proc.
section
301.
you
are
therefore
commanded
forthwith
to
arrest
the
above
name
and
bring
him
before
that
court
to
answer
the
indictment
or
if
the
court
have
adjourned
for
the
term
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
it
did
not
--
mr.
irving
anolik
it
had
not
adjourned
for
the
term.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
wouldn't
say
so,
justice
brennan.
this
is
a
situation
where
this
man
is
an
accused
in
the
criminal
action,
this
defendant
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no
justice
brennan,
i
think
it
means
to
bring
him
at
the
earliest
feasible
opportunity
which
was
done
here.
there
was
no
delay
in
arraignment
in
this
case,
justice
brennan.
he
was
arraigned
at
the
earliest
opportunity.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
--
that's
not
unusual
though,
justice
brennan,
for
a
--
a
confession
to
be
obtained
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
the
confession
itself
was
voluntary.
mr.
irving
anolik
in
a
technical
sense
he
wasn't
accused,
he
had
been
formally
indicted,
that
is
true,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
justice
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct,
justice
frankfurter,
for
example
if
this
man
had
not
been
surrendered
or
had
been
apprehended,
let's
say
in
other
state
even
if
he
was
under
indictment,
will
this
court
mean
that
that
fact
would
preclude
the
police
officer
--
officers
would
be
dispatch
to
bring
him
back
safe
in
california.
they
could
not
talk
to
him
even
if
they
--
mr.
irving
anolik
interrogate
him.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
agree
--
i
would
agree
with
you
justice
frankfurter
that
if
the
confession
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
this
is
before
the
arraignment
upon
the
indictment
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
but
i
don't
--
mr.
irving
anolik
but
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
record
will
support
that.
the
record
here
indicates
that
he
was
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
well,
the
record
here
indicates
he
was
brought
up
to
the
district
attorney's
office.
there
was
a
casual
questioning
at
about
11
o'clock
sandwich
was
--
were
brought
in,
he
was
well-fed,
in
fact
he
ate
more
than
anyone
else.
there
was
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
he
was
then
--
after
a
hiatus
of
some
45
minutes
or
--
or
an
hour
brought
to
the
46th
precinct
in
the
bronx
and
there
this
childhood
friend
of
him,
of
his
to
whom
he
had
already
given
an
admission
as
to
the
shooting
was
brought
in
and
spoke
to
him.
and
the
statement
given
to
the
district
attorney
following
that
conversation
was
substantially
consistent
with
the
statement
he
had
given
to
patrolman
bruno.
spano
did
not
confess
anything
to
the
police
by
virtue
of
their
questioning,
he
adhered
to
the
advice
of
his
attorney.
the
record
i
believe
substantiates
the
fact
of
spano
did
not
take
the
stance
so
there's
no
contest
in
this
record
but
that
it
was
voluntary
in
that
sense.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
agree
what
you
there,
justice
frankfurter.
if
--
if
i
understand
you
correctly
that
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
are
taken
--
is
taken
--
is
controlling
then
i
would
concede
that
that
would
be
a
proper
criteria
but
that
is
not
what
the
petitioner
urges
here,
the
petitioner
here
urges
--
mr.
irving
anolik
oh
i
understand
that
i'm
merely
trying
to
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand
that
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand
that
but
his
position
here
is
--
and
the
people
feel
that
it
is
an
untenable
position
in
view
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
this
cicenia
against
lagay
and
crooker
against
california
cases.
the
petitioner
urges
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
--
that
is
correct
justice
harlan
but
the
very
fact
of
the
indictment
with
nothing
more
is
what
petitioner
here
relies
upon
as
being
completely
controlling.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
bench
warrant
is
--
he
relies
upon
both.
now,
the
record
indicates
that
he
did
not
know
an
indictment
was
even
outstanding.
he
was
well-aware
that
he
was
sought
by
the
police
before
the
indictment
was
even
handed
down
against
them.
under
new
york
law
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
disclose
the
fact
of
indictment.
so
it
is
quite
probable
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
indictment
of
such,
he
merely
knew
he
was
wanted
and
that's
the
reason
he
surrendered.
i
think
a
perusal
of
record
will
indicate
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
don't
think
it
would
make
too
much
difference
at
all
justice
black.
i
merely
pointed
it
out
and
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question.
mr.
irving
anolik
he
was
a
defendant.
mr.
irving
anolik
he
was
due
to
be
put
in
jail
after
being
arraigned.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
he
was
surrendered
in
front
of
the
distinct
attorney's
office.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
submit
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no
it
didn't
but
by
the
same
token
it
didn't
forbid
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
for
example,
justice
black
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
black,
in
avery
against
alabama,
the
defendant
there
was
apprehended
in
pittsburgh.
he
had
been
indicted
in
1934,
he
was
apprehended
in
1938.
there
had
been
eyewitnesses
to
the
shooting.
the
record
at
folio
18
of
avery
against
alabama
indicates
a
statement
or
admissions
were
taken
from
him.
he
was
under
indictment
and
this
court
held
provided,
he
had
counsel
from
arraignment
until
final
judgment
is
right
for
the
counsel
were
utterly
absurd.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
the
question
--
mr.
irving
anolik
the
question
was
not
specifically
raised,
but
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct,
but
i
--
i
merely
point
that
out
that
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
a
man
who
is
under
indictment,
he's
merely
an
accused
in
a
criminal
proceeding
to
say
that
the
time
for
investigation
ceases
with
an
indictment
i
think
is
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
justice
black,
it
is
not
too
customary
to
surrender
a
man
in
front
of
the
district
attorney's
office
either
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
which
is
what
happened
here.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that
where
a
man
is
suspected
of
being
a
fugitive
as
spano
was,
was
he
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
--
well,
he's
a
suspect.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct
justice
black.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
--
i
--
i
couldn't
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
black
i
couldn't
answer
that
category
because
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
what
is
accordant
to
other
cases.
i
do
know
that
in
situations
where
indictments
have
been
found,
people
have
been
questioned
before
arraignment.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
they
usually
would
be
questioned
in
the
squad
room.
this
was
merely
for
the
sake
of
convenience
he
was
surrendered
in
front
of
the
district
attorney's
office
which
happens
to
be
in
the
bronx
country
building
and
was
taken
up
there.
he
was
rented
two
new
york
city
police
officers,
the
district
attorney
was
present.
this
was
a
prearranged
surrender.
it
was
at
07:10
p.m.
he
was
taken
up
there.
he
was
questioned
casually.
he
was
federal,
well
fed,
then
about
a
quarter
to
12,
12
o'clock
he
was
taken
to
the
46th
squad
room
which
had
the
46th
squad
having
jurisdiction
of
the
area
wherein
the
crime
was
committed
and
he
was
questioned
there
again
--
mr.
irving
anolik
detectives
that
questioned
him
there.
the
district
attorney
was
also
present.
there's
no
indication
of
an
incessant
questioning.
then
patrolman
bruno
was
called
in.patrolman
bruno
spoke
to
spano.
spano
then
gave
what
the
record
will
reveal
to
be
a
clearly
voluntary
confession,
substantially
consistent
to
that
to
which
he
had
already
given
prior
to
the
surrender
to
patrolman
bruno.
now
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
black
if
i
may,
the
record
indicates
that
to
only
two
people
according
to
the
record
that
he'd
say,
“i
want
my
lawyer,”
to
detective
ciccone
in
the
46th
squad
and
to
patrolman
bruno,
to
everyone
else
according
to
their
own
testimony,
this
is
uncontradicted
in
the
record.
he
said,
“see
my
lawyer.”
he
did
not
say
“i
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
he
was
not
justice
black.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
lawyer
surrendered
him
to
the
district
attorney.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
no
--
the
district
attorney
did
not
appear
in
the
record
that
he
said
to
the
district
attorney
“i
want
my
lawyer”.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
only
detective
ciccone
and
patrolman
bruno
indicates
that
he
said
to
them
he
wanted
his
lawyer.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
i
think
my
recollection
is
accurate.
that
he
said
to
the
district
attorney,
“i
want
my
lawyer.”
there's
no
evidence
of
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
there
was
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
there
was
a
hiatus
there
of
about
45
minutes
to
an
hour
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
fed
and
sandwiches
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no
that
was
about
11
o'clock
p.m.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
definitely,
there
are
testimonies
for
that
and
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
think
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
not
say
that.
i
would
--
the
last
statement
i
could
not
agree
with.
i
think
that
they
were
certainly
interested
in
getting
a
statement.
what
--
mr.
irving
anolik
oh
no,
no.
mr.
irving
anolik
for
example
they
asked
him
about
a
red
mark
on
his
head.
he
indicated
to
them
that
because
of
his
baldness
he
suffered
from
a
--
a
disease.
later
at
the
trial
it
indicated
from
his
own
doctor
that
he
just
--
that
he
suffered
from
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
from
about
7:30
to
11
and
perhaps
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
and
then
--
then
there
was
a
meal
and
thereafter
--
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
requesting
or
whether
he
was
just
transported
to
the
46th
squad.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that
certainly
it
would
be
improper
of
me
to
say
that
they
were
not
anxious
to
get
a
confession
in
the
sense
that
they
wanted
to
verify
the
statement
that
they
had
already
received
from
patrolman
bruno.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct,
justice
frankfurter,
that's
my
position.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
--
that
is
absolutely
--
mr.
irving
anolik
absolutely
correct,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
now,
i
would
say
that
if
i
can
just
hope
this
one
particular
point
that
i
think
this
case
raises
that
was
not
raised
in
the
crooker
or
the
cicenia
case
--
cases
that
here
we
have
an
indictment.
does
the
fact
of
an
indictment
ipso
facto
alter
the
situation
so
that
federal
rights
are
violated
by
questioning?
now,
we
have
seen
cases,
lisenba
against
california
where
a
man
is
taken
out
of
jail
and
questioned
by
an
invalid
court
order
and
yet
the
--
the
conviction
there
was
upheld.
we
have
seen
cases
about
that.
now,
does
the
fact
of
an
indictment,
in
fact,
i
can't
answer
this
question.
thus
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it's
one
of
first
impression
on
this
court.
does
an
indictment
ipso
facto
endow
a
man
with
rights
superior
to
those
to
which
any
other
accused
would
be
entitled?
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
mr.
irving
anolik
the
perez
(ph)
case,
justice
frankfurter,
the
--
the
material
witness
there
was
in
the
custody
of
the
warden
of
the
city
prison
or
with
the
civil
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
prison
rather.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
is
correct
now
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
now,
of
course,
in
the
perez
(ph)
case,
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
the
man
was
legally
and
properly
in
the
custody
of
the
police
authorities.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
it's
not.
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
of
course
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no
it
doesn't
necessarily.
now,
he
had
to
be
booked.
he
had
to
be
finger
printed
and
photographed.
that
is
true
whether
the
man
is
under
indictment
or
not.
he
must
be
arrested
on
the
indictment
on
the
new
york
law.
now,
what
if
this
had
occurred
during
that
course?
he
was
detained
here
for
the
purpose
of
booking
primarily.
now
it's
true
in
the
district
attorney's
office
since
he
was
surrendered
that
was
convenient
to
take
him
there.
i
might
add
this,
justice
frankfurter,
that
there
is
a
detective
squad
of
the
new
york
city
police
department
that
has
headquarters
in
the
district
attorney's
office.
it's
true
the
questioning
here
happened
to
take
place
in
the
office
of
assistant
district
attorney,
goldsmith.
but
two
new
york
city
detectives
to
whom
he
was
surrendered
were
present.
they
were
then
brought
to
the
46th
squad.
now
the
--
a
petitioner
here
urges
that
if
there
had
been
no
indictment
and
i
believe
i
translated
his
intentions
and
his
sentiments
correctly.
he
would
have
no
quarrel
or
whatsoever
with
this
situation.
in
other
words,
if
50
people
saw
spano
shoot
palermo
he
obviously
would
be
the
prime
suspect.
yet,
if
he
had
not
been
indicted
petitioner
would
say
that
perfectly
all
right
to
question
them
all
you
want,
but
if
you
indict
him
then
you
can't
do
anything.
would
it
be
morally
correct
for
the
district
attorney
here
justice
frankfurter
to
have
withheld
an
indictment
merely
to
get
a
statement
and
then
get
the
indictment
when
he
had
all
the
evidence
he
needed
for
it?
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
i'm
merely
urging
it,
justice
frankfurter.
i
hope
that
you
don't
say
--
mr.
irving
anolik
oh
of
course
we
do.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
in
--
in
printed
form.
the
people
supplied
me
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
with
some
copies
and
the
petitioner.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
i
believe
there
are
10
copies.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
think
10
copies
were
filed
with
the
court,
if
the
court
needs
any
additional
we
have
--
mr.
irving
anolik
but
i
believe
10
copies
were
filed.
mr.
irving
anolik
no
question
about
it.
mr.
irving
anolik
no
doubt
about
that,
too.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
there
was
--
there'd
be
some
question
as
to
whether
he
knew
there
was
a
bench
warrant
outstanding.
he
may
have
known,
he
may
not
have
known.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
he
did
not.
there's
no
evidence
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
of
that
whatsoever.
in
fact
in
new
york
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
disclose
the
fact
of
indictment
prior
to
a
man's
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
spano
himself
contact
this
--
now
that
this
--
i
--
i
must
go
--
the
record
to
answer
that
if
--
if
--
mr.
irving
anolik
the
record
does
not
specifically
show
whether
he
was
surrendered
pursuant
to
a
bench
warrant
or
not.
there
is
no
testimony
on
behalf
of
the
--
the
defendant
at
all
on
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
point.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct,
that
thought
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
conceded.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
--
mr.
irving
anolik
completely
conceded.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
thought
you
meant
that
the
defendant
--
mr.
irving
anolik
oh
no
question
about
that,
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
you
the
--
i
didn't
mean
to
mislead
you
at
all.
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
oh
no
--
no
doubt
about
that
at
all,
justice
brennan.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
day
before
his
surrender
of
february
3rd
at
about
9:20
p.m.
he
telephoned
bruno
whom
he
had
known
for
a
number
of
years.
told
him
what
he
had
done.
mr.
irving
anolik
bruno
is
a
rookie
patrolman,
a
childhood
friend
of
spano's.
at
that
time
he
was
a
rookie
patrolman
in
new
york
city
police
force.
bruno
testified
that
he
admitted
the
killing
“what
should
i
do?”
he
asked
him.
bruno
suggested
that
he
give
himself
up.
he
then
indicated
to
bruno
that
he
was
going
to
get
himself
a
lawyer
and
he
was
going
to
surrender.
bruno,
pursuant
to
police
regulations
i
would
assume
testified.
he
immediately
called
his
superiors
in
the
46th
squad
and
advised
them
of
the
fact
of
this
call
and
apparently
they
gave
him
some
further
instructions.
that
does
not
appear
exactly
what
the
further
instructions
were.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
i'm
--
i'm
familiar
with
that,
sir.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
even
seriously
contradicts
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
was
fully
submitted
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
irving
anolik
not
the
instructions
but
he
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
frank
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand
it
justice.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
now
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
now
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
i
recognize
that,
your
honor,
i
know
that
this
court
certainly
have
the
duty
and
the
right
to
make
an
independent
review
of
the
record.
may
i
point
out
justice
frankfurter
that
from
folios
1833
to
2022
of
the
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
1833
to
2022.
mr.
irving
anolik
of
the
record,
the
folios.
there's
an
elaborate
voir
dire
conducted
by
mr.
siegal
here
on
behalf
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner
that's
to
whether
or
not
the
confession
should
go
into
evidence
and
it
was
not
until
that
or
the
confession
even
went
into
evidence
and
then
there
was
instructions
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
think
it
was
detective
farrell
who
was
summoned
in
the
voir
dire.
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
he
was
not
called
for
the
stand.
he
was
available
there
obviously
but
he
was
not
called
for
the
stand.
mr.
irving
anolik
he
--
in
fact
he
tried
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
he
was
not
called
by
the
people.
in
the
final
analysis,
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court,
i
think
that
the
focal
point
of
this
issue
is
whether
an
indictment
making
a
man
a
defendant
it
is
true
but
being
no
more
than
an
accusation
of
guilt
means
(1)
that
investigation
--
further
investigation
is
precluded
and
the
people
contend,
it
does
not
mean
that
because
under
new
york
statutory
law,
less
proof
is
necessary
for
an
indictment
then
is
necessary
for
a
conviction.
(2)
does
the
fact
of
an
indictment,
ipso
facto
preclude
questioning
of
an
accused?
if
the
answer
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
black
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
didn't
come
to
number
three
yet,
justice
black.
number
three
would
be
that
if
the
record
itself
discloses
that
not
withstanding
an
indictment
and
not
withstanding
the
other
matters
that
the
confession
itself
was
taken
under
circumstances,
the
totality
of
circumstances
that
would
have
rendered
it
involuntary
not
withstanding
the
finding
of
new
york
court,
then,
of
course
this
court
would
--
would
have
a
duty
to
reverse,
too.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i'll
point
out,
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
defendant
here
was
arraigned
promptly.
justice
desmond
relies
upon
or
judge
desmond
relies
upon
cases
such
as
people
against
mcmann
and
people
against
01:00:33
which
you
will
see
in
this
opinion.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
of
course,
i
can't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
anolik
by
the
same
token
justice
brennan,
they
had
--
they
had
a
statement
from
him
before
he
even
surrendered.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
we
did
not
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
that's
correct
justice
frankfurter.
but
we
didn't
rely
on
that
exclusively.
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
mr.
irving
anolik
or
you
can
say,
justice
frankfurter
that
i
think
a
perusal
of
the
record
will
indicate
that
justice
desmond's
--
judge
desmond's
statement
is
not
wise.
i
would
add
this
fact
that
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
is
fairly
clear,
i
would
say
clear
beyond
doubt
that
the
questioning
of
spano
was
to
cover
a
hiatus.
there
were
eyewitnesses
to
a
--
beating,
how
severe
that
beating
was,
is
a
matter
of
dispute.
but
there
are
eyewitnesses
to
that
beating.
then
there
was
an
eyewitness
to
the
actual
shooting.
that
hiatus
between
the
beating
and
the
shooting
was
unaccounted
for
and
that
is
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
justice
frankfurter.
not
--
i'm
saying
not.
i'm
merely
saying
that
they
were
probing
and
attempting
to
verify
certain
practice
that'd
already
been
brought
to
their
attention.
mr.
irving
anolik
they
could
have
found
the
reverse.
now,
i
--
i
submit
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
could
have
been.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
but
there
were
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
except
that
they
were
not
sine
qua
non.
mr.
irving
anolik
sure.
mr.
irving
anolik
of
course,
a
district
attorney,
justice
frankfurter,
is
not
a
magistrate
and
as
such,
i
--
i
think,
the
court
will
concede
had
not
duty.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
see.
i
saw
your
position.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
yes.
his
execution
was
stayed
until
the
final
determination
by
this
court.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
don't
think
it's
warranted
--
mr.
irving
anolik
what
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
think
that
they
were
seeking
to
get
a
confession
but
he
is
assuming
that
they
would
have
kept
him
there
indefinitely,
which
i
don't
think
is
a
fair
inference
from
the
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
think
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i've
been
trying
to
transmit
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
on
the
evidence,
justice
black,
we
have
no
contradictory
evidence
whatsoever
by
the
defendant
because
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
incidentally
--
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
the
state,
that
is
the
respondent
here,
questioned
this
defendant
from
7:30
to
about
11:00.
there
were
sandwiches
brought
up.
mr.
irving
anolik
someone
went
out
for
sandwiches.
mr.
irving
anolik
he
--
he
stayed
there,
but
the
record
is
not
at
all
clear
that
he
was
questioned
incessantly.
in
other
words,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
incessant
--
insistent
--
mr.
irving
anolik
except
that
the
--
the
testimony
of
detective
lehrer
and
some
other
detectives
would
indicate
that
the
discussions
did
not
only
center
about
that
crime.
there
would
--
there
were
all
--
other
matters
discussed.
mr.
irving
anolik
they
--
they
discussed
his
physical
appearance
and
that
they
talked
--
i
--
i
can't
remember
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
off
hand,
i
couldn't
think
of
any,
justice
black.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
--
that
would
be
correct
--
that
would
be
definitely
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
a
--
a
strong
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
a
conversation
with
bruno.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
bruno
indicated
that
he
was
told
to
give
him
whatever
story
that
might
try
to
convince
him
to
--
to
make
a
statement.
in
other
words,
if
you
can
play
upon
his
sympathy
do
that
but
he
said
his
job
was
never
threatened.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
he
had
said
nothing,
he
adhered
to
his
attorney's
advice.
mr.
irving
anolik
the
record
then
indicates
that
after
a
conversation
with
bruno.
he
then
--
mr.
irving
anolik
the
purpose
of
the
conversation
was
the
fact
that
he
had
embarrassed
bruno
by
calling
him
the
day
before
that
bruno
might
get
into
difficulty
because
of
the
fact
that
spano,
an
accused
murderer
had
called
him
the
day
before
and
that
he
would
--
would
appreciate
it
as
a
matter
of
friendship
to
a
confess,
to
give
some
statement.
and
the
statement
he
gave
was
substantially
consistent
with
the
statement
that
he
read,
what
he'd
given
to
bruno.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say,
that
bruno
was
--
as
i
say
--
shall
we
--
putting
it
on
i
would
say.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
not
telling
the
truth
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i'm
sorry.
he's
not
telling
the
truth.
mr.
irving
anolik
bruno
was
told,
i
believe
that
the
record
would
--
would
indicate
that
he
was
told
to
play
on
his
sympathy
or
to
use
any
other
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
what,
use
his
lifelong
friendship
to
--
to
see
if
he
could
elicit
a
--
a
confession
from
him.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
if
i
did
then,
chief
justice,
i
--
i
didn't
intend
to.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
record
indicates
that
bruno
was
not
told
to
get
a
confession
or
else.he
was
told
to
go
in
there
and
talk
to
him.
see
if
you
can
get
him
to
--to
say
something.
it
wasn't
the
situation
where,
“well,
do
what
you
can,
you
better
get
it
or
--
or
otherwise
you're
going
to
be
fired
or
anything
of
that
sort.”
that
was
not
done.
mr.
irving
anolik
about
3:00
p.m.
or
3:00
a.m.
in
the
morning
i
would
say
that
bruno
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
right.
although
that
the
record
will
indicate
justice
harlan
that
bruno
was
in
the
district
attorney's
general
offices,
although
not
in
the
same
room
with
spano
earlier
in
evening.
he
was
not
called
in
at
that
point.
now,
(inaudible),
he's
a
member
of
police
force
but
it
was
not
until
around
3:00
a.m.
i
think
in
the
morning
that
he
was
told
to
speak
to
spano
and
out
following
that
conversation.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
probably
can.
mr.
irving
anolik
on
january
22nd,
1957.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
he
was
quite
a
rookie.
are
there
any
questions?
the
people
would
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
this
but
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
quite
true
that
this
is
a
murder
case.
this
man
was
not
just
plucked
out
of
the
street,
justice
frankfurter
as
a
possible
suspect.
he
was
--
an
eyewitness
had
already
identified
him.
he'd
already
given
a
statement
to
patrolman
bruno.
and
he
was
questioned.
the
court
--
this
court
has
often
recognized
that
and
has
condemned
plucking
a
man
as
a
possible
suspect
and
hammering
away
and
until
they
get
a
confession.
in
this
case
they
had
a
man
who
they
certainly
have
probable
cause
to
believe
had
committed
this
crime.
mr.
irving
anolik
he
had
had
the
advice
of
an
attorney
who's
--
who
turned
him
over
to
two
police
officers
in
the
district
attorney
on
the
street.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that
--
that
would
be
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate,
justice
frankfurter
that
there
was
any
agreement
that
he
would
not
be
questioned.
on
the
contrary,
since
he
was
admonished
not
to
say
anything,
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
recognizes,
apparently
interrogation
was
anticipated
otherwise
why
admonish
him
to
say
nothing.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
say
this
--
mr.
irving
anolik
detective
ciccone
testified
that
spano
asked
to
see
his
lawyer.
he
said
he
then
attempted
to
locate
his
lawyer's
name
in
the
telephone
book
and
was
unsuccessful.
the
attorney
--
mr.
irving
anolik
he
was
known
but
this
was
the
46th
one.
he
was
then
--
he
then
asked
patrolman
--
mr.
irving
anolik
pardon
me?
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
in
other
words,
detective
ciccone
wouldn't
necessarily
have
known
this
particular
lawyer.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct,
but
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
frankfurter,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
record
indicates
that
detective
ciccone
alleges
that
he
attempted
to
find
the
name
in
the
telephone
book
and
could
not.
so,
there's
nothing
further
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
brennan.
mr.
irving
anolik
but
that
is
assuming,
justice
brennan
that
a
direct
request
was
made
to
the
--
the
assistant.
but
there's
no
evidence
of
that
at
all.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
i
think,
the
police
officer
should
be
reprimanded
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
agree.
if
the
court,
this
court
has
passed
upon
similar
problems,
justice
frankfurter,
not
while
on
indictment
was
extant,
that's
true
but
certainly
this
court
has
passed
on
in
the
cicenia
and
the
crooker
cases.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
know
it's
not.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
in
the
lisenba
case,
there
was
a
request
for
counsel
and
counsel
was
not
furnished.
i
believe
in
stroble
there
was
a
question
or
there
was
a
request
for
counsel
and
counsel
was
not
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
of
course,
in
--
i
believe
in
--
in
lisenba
he
had
a
lawyer
and
the
--
it
was
--
they
took
him
out
on
--
on
may
2nd
or
something
and
questioned
him
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct
and
i
think
the
same
issue
would
have
to
be
faced
here,
justice
frankfurter
or
that
was
not
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
question
about
it,
he
was.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
could
have
been
due
to
a
misunderstanding
of
the
pronunciation
of
the
name.
i
don't
know
but
i
--
i'm
not
trying
to
justify
detective
ciccone,
chief
justice
warren.
make
no
mistake
about
that.
i
merely
say
that
his
testimony
stands
that
he
couldn't
locate
him.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
think
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
about
all
he
could
have
done.
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
another
--
another
way
of
putting
it,
justice
black.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
quite
correct.
now,
of
course,
in
state
v.
bump
which
is
a
new
jersey
decision
cited
on
my
brief,
the
court
there
indicates
where
a
--
a
somewhat
similar
but
not
identical
situation
obtained
that
while
an
attorney
should
be
present
to
defend
the
client
an
attorney
is
not
necessary
to
protect
the
client
from
his
own
voluntary
statements.
and
if
this
was
a
voluntary
statement,
then
the
people
submit
no
federal
right
was
produced.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
would
say
that
--
of
course,
it's
a
difficult
question
to
answer.
i
would
say
that
that's
where
the
significance
of
a
prompt
arraignment
might
come
into
issue.
if
this
man
had
been
detained,
shall
we
say
until
the
6th
of
february,
another
full
day
and
then
the
--
the
confession
obtained.
then
we
might
say
that
here
they
went
too
far.
but
in
this
case,
this
--
this
specific
case
they
arraigned
him
promptly
as
soon
as
the
courts
reopened
that
morning.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
suppose,
it
would
be
conceivable
but
unlikely
in
view
of
the
fact
they
have
to
have
him
fingerprinted,
booked
and
photographed
before
he
was
brought
into
that
court
and
that
was
done.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that,
there
again,
assuming
that
the
record
indicates
the
confession
of
itself
was
voluntary,
yes.
i'd
have
to
say
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
say
that
to
be
consistent.
i
have
to
say
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
but
may
i
say
this,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
that
only
two
witnesses,
patrolman
bruno
and
detective
ciccone
ever
testified
that
he
asked
for
his
lawyer
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
the
other
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
mr.
irving
anolik
of
course,
not.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
i
merely
emphasize
that
from
this
point
of
view
only,
justice
warren,
that
there
is
no
direct
evidence
in
this
record
that
that
request
was
made
to
the
district
attorney
or
to
the
two
detectives
to
whom
he
surrendered.
to
them
it's
true.
they
testified,
he
said,
“you'd
better
see
my
lawyer
about
that.”
now,
that
--
that
is
what
the
record
says,
justice
warren.
i'm
not
attempting
to
characterize
it
one
way
or
the
other.
we're
bound
by
the
record.
there's
no
question
about
that.
now,
if
--
if
this
meant
that
the
questioning
here,
if
it
was
voluntary,
the
people
submit
that
there's
no
reason
to
invoke
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
an
indictment
was
extant.
if
it
was
not
voluntary,
of
course,
there
is
obviously,
a
fourteenth
amendment
problem.
mr.
irving
anolik
instructions
are
not
the
question
at
all
after
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
typically,
that
is
what
institutes
the
judicial
proceeding.
section
144
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
of
new
york
speaks
of
judicial
proceedings
commencing
with
the
filing
of
an
indictment
but
that
section
has
reference
to
statutes
of
limitations.
and
in
only
in
that
sense
that
a
judicial
proceeding
start
and
certainly,
i
think
that
this
court
will
recognize
that
this
interrogation
was
not
a
judicial
proceeding
upon
that
indictment
as
the
dissent
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
stewart,
if
an
indictment,
as
i
say,
precludes
any
questioning
whatsoever,
then,
of
course,
my
cause
is
--
is
lost.
i
concede
that.
if
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
the
fact
of
an
indictment
in
a
state
court
precludes
any
further
investigation,
any
further
question
then
i
--
i
concede
that
my
cause
is
lost.
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
is
not
--
is
not
required
to
make
such
a
determination
in
view
of
its
decisions
and
in
view
of
this
record.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
he
did.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
--
that's
correct.
he
sent
them
back
several
times.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
a
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
he
happened
to
live
in
the
neighborhood.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
no.
he
telephoned
him
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
a
day
before
this.
so
they
knew
about
this
conversation,
the
day
before
you
see.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
the
--
although
the
statement
of
the
stenographer
indicate
an
earlier
time
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
there's
some
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
anolik
no.
i
--
i
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
that's
correct.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
indulgence.
