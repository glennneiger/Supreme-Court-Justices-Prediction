justice
william

brennan,
jr.
did
the
district
attorney
have
an
arrest
warrant
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
district
attorney
have
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
arrest
made
under
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
the
bench
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
--
what
was
done
certainly
was
not
an
obedience
to
the
--
a
command
to
that
word
as
i
understood
your
adversary
reading
that
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
had
that
adjourned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
there
in
the
bench
warrant?
i
don't
have
it
before
me.
what
is
there
in
the
bench
warrant
that
you
are
suggesting
that
that
authorizes
this
kind
of
interrogation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
was
the
--
what
was
its
command
that
the
court
--
the
in
term?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
fail,
well,
it
hasn't
adjourned
for
the
terms
--
so
far.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
to
that
court
to
answer
the
indictment?
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
what
--
does
that
rather
imply
or
does
it
--
certainly
no
authority
to
question
in
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
this
could
be
read
and
bring
in
before
the
court
to
answer
the
indictment
unless
you
want
to
question
and
take
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
you
got
the
confession
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
or
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
defendant,
not
an
accused.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
defendant
is
an
accused,
an
indictment
is
an
accusation
on
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
as
such
he
wasn't
accused,
he
was
a
defendant,
that's
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
the
record
--
trial
record
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
stenographic
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
in
the
attorney's
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
enough
for
all
of
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
there
is
no
dispute
between
you
that
at
the
time
this
man
was
surrendered,
the
district
attorney's
office
knew
that
he
had
a
lawyer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
question
about
it
that
and
there
is
no
question
that
they
knew
he's
been
indicted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
he
was
being
surrendered
pursuant
to
a
bench
warrant
issued
on
the
indictment.
there's
no
dispute
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
knew
he
was
being
surrendered
by
his
lawyer
pursuant
to
an
indictment
the
first
time
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
the
district
attorney
think
he
was
being
surrendered
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
the
record
show
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
certainly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
district
attorney
knew
that
there
was
an
outstanding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that's
conceded
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
there
was
an
outstanding
indictment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
bench
warrant
was
issued
on
that
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
asking
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
was
asking
whether
district
attorney
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
may
have
just
spoken
to
myself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
im
not
--
every
time
you
--
you
said
that
before
by
which
you
mean
only
that
he
was
arraigned
at
10
o'clock
the
following
morning.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
to
say
had
not
obtained
the
confession
at
3:30
that
morning
he
would
have
been
arraigned
at
10
o'clock?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
you
could
prove
it
either
one
--
what
--
what's
the
significance
in
this
case
that
he
wasn't
in
fact
arraigned
at
10:00
since
they
already
had
the
confession
at
the
time
of
arraignment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
bruno
--
bruno
i
gather
in
representing
that
he
--
bruno
might
be
in
trouble
and
that
this
might
have
consequences
for
bruno's
wife
and
child
and
so
forth.
he
was
not
telling
the
truth
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
not
telling
the
truth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
sense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
use
the
lifelong
friendship.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
insisting
could
certainly
do
him
because
he
had
received
spano
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
attorney
didn't
he?
