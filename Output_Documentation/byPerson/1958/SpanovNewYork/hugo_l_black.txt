what
did
he
mean
by
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
(inaudible)
man
claiming
that
he
owed
it
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
--
the
judge
had
been
--
and
instead
of
reporting
to
the
district
attorney
--
the
district
attorney
has
brought
in
the
judge
and
it's
closed
the
door,
made
the
same
inquiry
to
the
district
attorney
in
the
office,
would
that
change
the
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
judge
has
done
before
indictment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he'd
already
been
indicted.
but
suppose
the
judge
after
this
case
had
been
set
on
to
trial,
and
he
just
shuts
the
door,
let
the
district
attorney
ask
the
big
question
will
that
violate
the
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
they
meant
by
psychologically
coerced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
they
cite
any
of
--
of
the
cases
on
which
they've
relied
that
those
witnesses
of
persons
had
subjected
to
long,
continuous,
consistent
questioning
although
there
was
no
coercion
of
any
--
no
physical
action
of
any
kind.
are
those
the
cases
they've
allowed
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
not
one
of
those
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
related
to
this
unlawful
detention
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
only.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
they
used
the
word
psychological
in
connection
with
the
cases
by
--
and
were
subjected
to
long,
continued
questioning
over
a
long
period
of
hours
out
of
which
emerged
the
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
one
way
it
could
be
stated
but
it's
not
a
little
difficulty
(inaudible)
psychological?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
that
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
whatever
he
knew
or
thought.
he
was
a
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
was
due
to
be
put
in
jail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

to
the
district
attorney's
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
their
--
was
--
was
he
surrendered
for
questioning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
bench
warrant,
it
didn't
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
ordinarily
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
taken
to
jail
not
to
the
district
attorney
to
get
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
question
raise
or
brought
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

the
other
questions
raised
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
even
come
under
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
i
--
i
don't
know
but
i've
never
been
(inaudible)
where
i
came
from.
is
it
customary
that
people
on
the
indictment
to
take
them
first
to
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
to
let
him
question
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
if
he
surrendered
in
front
of
the
district
attorney's
office.
i'm
just
wandering,
is
that
the
custom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he's
--
he's
not
a
suspect,
he's
indicted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he's
indicted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
surrendered
himself
to
be
arrested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
not
--
is
it
customary
in
new
york
to
take
the
people
who
are
indicted
that
way
and
to
take
them
to
jail,
take
them
to
the
district
attorney's
office
for
questioning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
it
been
taken
--
is
it
the
custom
to
take
them
to
the
district
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
--
who
questioned
him
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
don't
see
you
leap
by
the
hurdle
do
you
not
when
you
say
that
the
man
has
been
under
question
for
all
these
hours,
at
the
district
attorney's
office,
begging
for
a
lawyer.
so
you
leap
by
the
hurdle
do
you
not
and
say
that
has
to
be
voluntary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
made
that
request
to
a
lawyer
(inaudible)
the
lawyer
was
there
when
he
said
“i
need
my
lawyer,”
wasn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lawyer
was
never
there,
he
didn't
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
district
attorney's
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
he
say
it
while
the
district
attorney
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
--
i
thought
your
emissary
told
us
that
the
district
attorney
or
assistant
that
(inaudible)
throughout
the
interrogation
while
others
came
in
and
out
of
the
room.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
confession
and
this
confession
to
prove?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
who
is
bruno?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
---
i
don't
see
how
even
if
your
adversary
has
(inaudible)
i
didn't
so
understand.
certainly,
justice
frankfurter
said
he
couldn't
buy
or
does
change
his
analysis.
why
do
you
say
that
--
settles
it
all,
just
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
if
he's
indicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
if
there
was
none
but
can
--
might
--
might
possibly
(inaudible)
if
there
isn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
said
several
times
that
justice
desmond's
statement
was
not
correct
because
to
the
effect
that
they
kept
them
there
to
get
a
--
until
they
get
a
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
possible
purpose
could
they
have
had
in
keeping
him
there
and
questioning
him
as
they
did
except
to
get
a
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
we
have
no
--
no
basis
on
which
to
prophesy
exactly
how
long
they
would
have
kept
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
--
your
problem
is
i
think
not
to
decide
that
show
that
justice
desmond
was
not
right
in
that
but
try
to
show
that
by
the
second
(inaudible)
the
way
they
did,
it
doesn't
conflict
with
our
previous
opinion
as
to
due
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
evidence
but
i
--
i
do
not
yet
see
where
you
have
established
that
justice
desmond's
statement
is
incorrect
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
he
did
it,
it's
a
question
of
uncontradicted
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
they
go
out
to
get
the
sandwiches
or
they
just
stayed
there
while
they
were
questioning
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
get
out
or
did
he
stay
there
for
questioning
during
at
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
may
not
be
but
what
other
earthly
object
that
anybody
would
think
about
that
having
in
therefore
during
that
time
except
to
question
him
and
keep
on
questioning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
other
matter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
other
subjects
did
they
discuss
that
didn't
have
something
to
do
with
--
some
kind
of
possible
relevance
under
this
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
more
advice
did
the
lawyer
have
given
if
they
called
him
and
brought
him
up
to
than
that
which
he
had
already
given
them
and
that
which
the
man
kept
saying,
”my
lawyer
has
told
me
not
to
talk.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
all
he
could
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
maybe
when
you
say
that
the
lawyer
had
admonished
him
because
he
anticipated
questioning
maybe
it'd
be
a
little
clearer,
if
you'd
say
because
he
feared
he
would
be
questioned.
