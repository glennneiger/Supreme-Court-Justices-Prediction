did
the
admissibility
of
his
confession
go
to
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i
was
wondering
was
whether
your
position
here
turns
solely
on
the
absence
of
the
counsel
or
whether
you
make
a
broader
contention
that
absence
of
counsel
taken
in
to
consideration
that
the
whole
--
the
whole
setting
should
have
excluded
his
confession
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
a
matter
of
due
process?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
this
is
a
coerced
confession?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
in
that
light.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
we
wouldn't
be
concluded
by
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
indictment
neither
those
--
justice
john
m.

m.
harlan

this
man's
execution
stayed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
the
matter
(inaudible)
how
long
have
been
--
how
long
the
district
attorney
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
forced
the
answer
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
the
--
now,
what
is
the
practice
in
new
york
after

where
a
man

incarcerated
waiting

the
police
have
as
to
whether
it's
admissible

mandatory
or
not?

that
everything
up
until
