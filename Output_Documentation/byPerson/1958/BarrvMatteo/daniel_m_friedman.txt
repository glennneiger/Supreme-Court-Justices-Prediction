mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
presented
by
this
case
and
by
the
case
which
immediately
follows
it
is
whether
government
executive
officials
below
the
rank
of
cabinet
officer
have
an
absolute
immunity
for
alleged
defamatory
statements
made
in
the
course
of
their
official
duties
relating
to
matters
over
which
they
have
supervision
and
control.
in
this
case,
the
alleged
libel
consisted
of
a
press
release
issued
by
the
head
of
an
independent
agency.
in
the
case
which
follows
it,
it
involved
the
transmission
by
a
high
naval
official,
two
members
of
congress,
of
copies
of
a
report
which
he
had
made
to
his
superiors
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties.
in
each
case,
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
divided
court,
held
that
the
defamatory
statement
was
not
absolutely
privileged
but
only
subjected
to
a
qualified
privilege.
that
is
a
privilege,
which
could
be
--
could
be
lost
by
showing
that
the
statement
was
malicious
or
that
it
went
beyond
what
was
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
now,
prior
to
discussing
the
facts
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
indicate
briefly
to
the
court
the
policy
considerations
which
underlie
the
rule
of
absolute
immunity.
i
believe
that
is
important
because
when
you
deal
with
a
case
of
this
type,
one
might
tend
to
instinctively
react
and
say,
“well,
if
a
government
official
maliciously
defamed
someone,
why
shouldn't
he
be
held
responsible
in
damages?”
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
was
put
most
eloquently
by
judge
learned
hand
in
the
celebrated
case
of
gregoire
against
biddle
in
which
he
held
there
was
an
absolute
privilege
governing
the
performance
of
official
duties
by
the
judicial
officers
of
the
government
in
a
proceeding
involving
an
alleged
improper
retention
in
custody
of
an
enemy
alien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
but
we
believe
that
the
principles
that
are
involved
are
equally
applicable.
now,
i'd
like
us
to
read
briefly
two
or
three
sentences
to
the
court
in
judge
hand's
opinion.
he
starts
by
saying,
“it
does
indeed
go
without
saying
that
an
official,
who
is
in
fact
guilty
of
using
his
powers
to
vent
his
spleen
upon
others,
or
for
any
other
personal
motive
not
connected
with
the
public
good,
should
not
escape
liability
for
the
injuries
he
may
so
cause.
and,
if
it
were
possible
in
practice
to
confine
such
complaints
to
the
guilty,
it
would
be
monstrous
to
deny
recovery.
the
justification
for
doing
so
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
the
claim
is
well
founded
until
the
case
has
been
tried,
and
that
to
submit
all
officials,
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty,
to
the
burden
of
a
trial
and
to
the
inevitable
danger
of
its
outcome,
would
dampen
the
ardor
of
all
but
the
most
resolute,
or
the
most
irresponsible,
in
the
unflinching
discharge
of
their
duties.
again
and
again
the
public
interest
calls
for
action
which
may
turn
out
to
be
founded
on
a
mistake,
in
the
face
of
which
an
official
may
later
find
himself
hard
put
to
it
to
satisfy
a
jury
of
his
good
faith.”
and
then
judge
hand
concludes
this,
says,
“as
is
so
often
the
case,
the
answer
must
be
found
in
a
balance
between
the
evils
inevitable
in
either
alternative.
in
this
instance
it
has
been
thought
in
the
end
better
to
leave
unredressed
the
wrongs
done
by
dishonest
officers
than
to
subject
those
who
try
to
do
their
duty
to
the
constant
dread
of
retaliation."
in
other
words,
this
policy
that
is
sort
to
be
protected
by
the
doctrine
of
absolute
privilege
is
a
recognition
that
public
officials
may
be
hesitant
to
do
their
duty
freely
and
resolutely
if
they
know
that
at
some
future
date,
they
may
be
required
to
come
before
a
jury
and
satisfy
the
jury
of
their
good
faith.
that
they
acted
properly.
that
they
did
not
exceed
what
was
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
it's
very
easy
in
one
of
these
cases
and
it's
true
in
most
of
these
defamation
cases
for
the
plaintiff
to
allege
that
the
defendant
did
this
maliciously.
that
he
did
it
with
the
intention
to
injure
the
plaintiff.
this
puts
the
government
official
in
the
position
of
having
to
be
certain
that
at
some
future
date,
he
will
be
able
to
satisfy
the
jury
of
his
good
faith.
now,
if
that
is
the
rule
and
that
is
the
rule
in
effect
of
qualified
privilege,
what
this
means
as
judge
hand
pointed
out
is
that
if
you've
got
a
case
where
even
though
the
public
interest
would
call
for
government
action,
an
official
will
be
reluctant
to
act.
he
will
be
reluctant
to
act
because
at
some
future
date,
he
may
find
it
necessary
to
litigate,
two
years
hence,
one
year
hence,
the
bona
fides
of
which
he
acted.
now,
we
think
this
consideration
is
particularly
important
in
the
area
involved
in
these
cases
which
is
the
furnishing
of
information
to
the
public.
today,
the
issuance
of
press
releases
is
a
vital
and
necessary
part
of
the
language
our
government
operates.
that's
frequently
the
only
way
in
which
adequate
information
may
be
given
to
the
public.
we've
heard
recently
a
great
deal
of
concern
with
the
fact
that
government
officials
have
been
withholding
information
which
the
public
is
entitled
to,
the
emphasis
on
the
public
right
to
know.
well,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public's
right
to
know,
we
think
that
damage
could
equally
be
done.
if
government
officials
hesitate
to
make
information
public,
which
they
think
the
performance
of
their
duties
requires
them
to
make
public
because
of
the
threat
of
this
possible
litigation.
and
the
doctrine
of
absolute
privilege
is
designed
to
protect
this
interest
by
blocking
off
at
the
inception
these
litigation
suits
to
make
it
clear
that
if
he
doesn't
--
the
official
does
not
have
to
go
in
and
litigate
these
particular
issues
at
great
time,
at
great
expense
and
the
fear
that
he
may
ultimately
be
held
liable
for
something
which
is
within,
he
believed,
necessary
in
the
case
to
protect
the
public
interest.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
is
one
of
those
situations
where
the
particular
act
involved,
the
particular
statement
issued
must
be
weighed
on
the
other
hand
against
the
broader,
public
interest.
now,
with
this,
by
way
of
background,
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
particular
defamation
involved
in
this
litigation.
this
law
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
in
this
area,
the
giving
out
press
releases
and
the
making
of
this
information
available
to
the
public
is
an
essential
part
of
a
government
official's
duty
that
one
of
the
important
things
and
such
a
program
is
rent
stabilization
is
getting
before
the
public.
what
the
agency
is
doing,
developing
public
confidence
in
the
agency.
now,
i
think
if
he
redefined
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
stop
at
two
things
-
one,
it
has
to
be
an
executive
policy
making
official
and
secondly,
the
statements
have
to
be
related
to
the
course
of
his
official
duties.
if
a
government
official
just
maliciously
goes
out
and
slanders
someone
and
they're
having
no
relation
to
the
course
of
his
official
duties,
in
that
situation,
he
is
not
entitled.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
long
as
it
--
again
--
he's
of
the
--
he's
performing
the
kind
of
function
in
which
the
distribution
of
information
to
the
public
is
a
necessary
part
and
usual
part
of
his
job
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
qualification
that
it
has
to
relate
to
matters
committed
to
his
duties.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think,
again,
it
would
have
to
be
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
i
think
when
you
get
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
man
who
is
the
acting
head
of
an
independent
agency,
i
think
that
--
in
which
i
might
i
add
the
issuance
of
press
releases
was
a
normal
matter,
i
think
this
is
the
kind
of
an
official
who
has
the
responsibility
of
seeing
to
it
that
the
public
is
adequately
informed.
i
think
the
case
which
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
is
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
involved
the
marshall
who
issued
a
press
release.
well,
we
think
a
marshall
is
a
different
kind
of
official.
he's
not
a
policy-making
official.
the
--
i
might
say
the
line
is
not
an
easy
one
to
draw.
it
turns
on
the
fact
of
the
particular
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
only
can
draw
it,
i
think,
in
these
vague
terms
of
the
policy-making
official
whose
function
includes
the
making
of
adequate
publicity
in
a
particular
post
that
he
occupied.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
key
to
this
case
is
that
this
man
was
the
acting
head
of
an
agency.
he
was
in-charge
of
this
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
and
we
shall
argue
in
that
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that
there,
he
was
under
an
affirmative
duty
as
distinguished
from
being
within
the
area
of
his
discretion.
again,
i
think
it
--
it
turns
on
the
organization,
in
particular,
branch
of
the
government
that
you're
dealing
with.
now,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
mr.
barr,
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
libel
was
the
acting
director
of
the
office
of
rent
stabilization.
the
office
of
rent
stabilization
was
an
agency
that
had
been
created
by
the
parent
organization,
the
office
of
economic
stabilization
pursuant
to
a
specific
presidential
delegation
of
a
party
which
in
turn
derived
from
the
basic
act.
congress
directed
the
president
to
delegate
to
this
economic
stabilization
agency
the
authority
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
was,
at
the
time,
the
acting
director
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
director
was
out
of
town
and
under
agency
regulations
when
the
director
was
out
of
town,
the
acting
director
--
the
deputy
director
was
the
acting
director.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
long
as
under
the
organization
of
the
agency,
whoever
was
in
charge
of
the
agency,
whoever
occupied
all
the
powers
and
responsibilities
of
this
agency
was
the
man
to
whom
this
privilege
would
be
accorded.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
alleged
defamatory
press
release
in
this
case,
related
to
a
terminal
leave
plan
which
the
respondents
had
prepared
and
responsible
for
at
a
predecessor
agency,
the
office
of
the
housing
expediter.
that
had
happened
in
1950,
a
terminal-leave
plan
for
using
up
certain
terminal-leave
had
taken
place.
at
the
time,
this
terminal-leave
took
place,
the
petitioner
was
the
deputy
director
of
that
agency
and
he
opposed
the
plans
strongly
and
it
was
recognized
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
that
he
had
opposed
it.
but
this
opposition
did
not
prevail
and
the
plan
was
effectuated
for
49
of
the
employees
of
that
agency.
almost
three
years
later,
the
office
of
rent
stabilization
received
a
request
from
senator
williams
for
some
information
with
respect
to
this
terminal-leave
plan.
and
the
respondent,
mr.
madigan,
who
is
the
director
of
administration
of
the
agency
prepared
a
letter
for
petitioner's
signature
setting
forth
the
facts
with
respect
to
this
plan
and
in
petitioner's
view,
this
letter
supported
the
plan.
the
letter
was
not
seen
by
petitioner
before
it
was
sent,
however.
petitioner
was
otherwise
engaged
in
a
conference
and
the
letter
was
signed
in
his
name
by
his
secretary
and
sent
out
to
senator
williams.
the
following
day,
senator
williams
made
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
which
he
bitterly
attacked
this
terminal-leave
plan.
three
other
senators
joined
with
him
in
this
attack
and
it
was
suggested
that
the
matter
which
should
be
investigated
by
the
senate.
these
payments
were
described
as
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government
and
as
a
raid
on
the
treasury.
and
this
statements
made
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
received
a
great
deal
of
newspaper
publicity.
that
speech
took
place
on
wednesday.
the
press
release
was
issued
the
next
day
on
thursday
and
at
that
time,
petitioner
called
in
these
two
people
involved
and
tells
them
that
as
a
result
of
the
adverse
criticism
of
the
agency,
he
was
going
to
suspend
them
as
a
disciplinary
measure
and
at
the
same
time
he
issued
a
press
release.
that
the
issuance
of
the
press
release
is
as
i've
stated
was
a
normal
practice
in
the
agency
at
that
time.
the
press
release
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
four
to
five
of
the
record
stated
that
--
announced
that
he
was
suspending
these
two
individuals.
he
mentioned
them
by
name
and
he
stated
in
june
1950,
“my
position
in
the
agency
was
not
one
of
authority
which
would
have
permitted
me
to
stop
the
action.
anyone
who
ought
to
say
while
i
was
advised
that
the
action
was
legal,
i
took
the
position
that
it
violated
the
spirit
of
the
thomas
amendment
and
i
violently
oppose
that
the
thomas
amendment
in
passing
was
an
amendment
to
the
general
appropriations
act
which
required
leave
to
be
used
within
a
certain
period
and
prohibiting
carrying
over
annual
leave
into
the
next
year.”
and
he
issued
this
press
release.
shortly,
there
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it's
the
theory
of
the
--
suited
as
by
innuendo
that
since
these
people
have
--
that
this
scheme
had
been
referred
to
on
the
floor
of
congress
as
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government
and
it's
a
raid
on
the
treasury
when
he
indicated
that
he
was
suspending
the
two
people
who
had
been
responsible
for
it
by
innuendo,
the
suggestions,
he
was
accusing
them
of
being
parties
to
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government
and
raiding
the
treasury.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
it
did
not,
mr.
justice.
what
it
stated
was
that
what
he
was
doing
and
he
was
explaining
the
reasons
why
it
was
--
why
he
believed
it
was
necessary
to
suspend
these
people.
and
in
considering
the
press
release,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
remember
that
this
followed
by
one
day
these
speeches
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
which
had
gotten
wide
publicity
and
which
necessarily
would
hold
the
agency
up
to
public
criticism
and
scorn.
people
would
think
that
this
is
one
of
those
government
agencies
where
people
were
engaging
in
a
regular
practice
as
an
--
we
believe
that
he
was
fully
justified
in
issuing
this
press
release
in
the
circumstances
in
order
to
regain
public
confidence
in
the
agency
and
for
him
to
make
it
clear
that
he
did
not
condone
this
plan
which
had
been
criticized
and
that
he
was
taking
disciplinary
action
against
the
persons
responsible
for
it.
the
libel
action
was
filed
shortly
after
the
issuance
of
the
press
release.
the
district
court
rejected
the
contention
of
mr.
barr
that
it
was
absolutely
privileged,
held
that
it
was
not
even
covered
by
a
qualified
privilege
and
sent
the
case
to
the
jury
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
one,
the
publication
was
defamatory
and
two,
if
it
was,
whether
the
--
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
punitive
damages.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
for
$6500
and
$2000
respectively.
the
government
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
rather
mr.
barr
appealed,
the
government
was
representing
him
as
counsel
in
the
case
and
raised
at
--
in
that
stage
of
the
case
only
the
question
of
absolute
privilege.
the
district
court
by
a
divided
court
sustained
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
absolute
privilege.
the
court
reasoned
as
follows
-
it
said
that
the
defendant's
decision
to
suspend
the
plaintiffs
and
his
execution
of
any
documents
appropriate
to
that
end
were
probably
within
his
general
line
of
duty.
and
if
so,
if
he
had
written
a
letter
to
his
superior
explaining
what
he
was
doing,
that
would
have
been
within
his
line
of
duty.
however,
the
court
went
on,
in
explaining
his
decision
to
the
general
public,
the
defendant
went
entirely
outside
his
line
of
duty.
and
then
the
court
suggested
that
if
in
this
case,
the
defendant
had
been
a
cabinet
officer,
the
public
explanation
might
have
been
absolutely
privileged.
however,
it
went
on
and
said
they
didn't
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
the
public
explanation
of
the
head
of
an
independent
agency
such
as
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
the
director
of
the
parent
agency,
the
economic
stabilization
agency
would
be
entitled
to
a
qualified
privilege.
they
said
they
didn't
have
to
reach
that
situation.
they
said
that
this
man,
the
acting
head
of
the
--
of
the
office
of
rent
stabilization
was
not
in
that
character
--
category.
and
they
analogized
his
position
to
that
of
the
united
states
marshall,
which
in
a
previous
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
was
not
covered
by
an
absolute
privilege.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
rely
on
the
general
authority
given
to
him
to
conduct
the
operation
of
this
agency
the
delegation
to
him
by
the
director
of
the
economic
stabilization
agency
gave
him
--
made
him
responsible
for
the
effective
development
and
administration
of
an
appropriate
program
of
rent
stabilization.
and
we
think
this
broad
authority
given
to
him
as
head
of
this
agency
necessarily
carried
with
it
the
authority
to
issue
press
releases
to
make
known
to
the
public
what
his
agency
was
doing.
i
--
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
believe
that
in
any
if
the
government
agencies
authorizing
legislation
there
is
any
specific
authority
to
issue
press
releases.
this
is
just
the
normal
inherit
function
of
government
to
publicize
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
generally,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
in
specific
terms,
but
it's
understood.
i
mean,
certainly,
i
have
no
authority
to
issue
press
releases
for
the
department
of
justice.
i
don't
know
whether
there's
a
specific
authority.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
man
was
the
head
of
the
agency.
this
was
not
a
subordinate
official.
this
was
the
man
who,
at
the
moment,
was
in
full
charge
of
this
agency
and
had
full
responsibility
for
carrying
out
the
rent
control
program.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
an
independent
agency
but
the
head
of
the
agency
is
not
--
was
not
appointed
by
the
president.
he
was
appointed
by
the
prior
agency,
the
agency
above
this,
the
director
of
economic
stabilization.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
more
than
just
a
division
because
this
man
was
not
--
was
not
reporting
back
to
the
head
of
the
economic
stabilization
other
than
consulting
on
the
broadest
policy
grounds.
he
was
the
one
who
had
the
full
responsibility
for
promulgating
the
rent
regulations,
for
hiring
and
firing,
for
taking
whatever
steps
were
necessary
to
carry
out
an
effective
program
of
rent
control.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
in
the
sense
in
which
you're
using
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
didn't
have
an
immediate
superior
except
in
the
sense
that
he
reported
to
the
head
of
the
of
--
the
director
of
the
economic
stabilization
authority,
in
much
the
same
sense,
i
suppose,
that
a
cabinet
officer
reports
to
the
president.
in
that
sense,
this
was
his
superior.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
could
have.
it
could
have,
but
i
think
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
delegation
to
him
by
the
economic
stabilization
authority
was
in
the
broadest
of
terms,
they
have
given
unto
him
the
power
to
decide
whether
to
issue
these
press
releases
or
not.
now,
in
the
case
of
cabinet
officers,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
spalding
against
vilas
it's
been
considered
settled
from
60
years
that
a
cabinet
officer
has
absolute
immunity
for
defamation
even
though
he
is
not
under
a
duty
to
issue
the
statement
in
a
sense
that
he's
affirmatively
required
as
long
as
this
court
said
that
the
statement
relates
to
matters
having
more
or
less
connection
with
the
general
matters
committed
by
law
to
his
control
or
supervision.
in
other
words,
as
long
as
you're
within
the
broad
area
within
which
the
official
is
authorized
to
act,
he
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
something
done
in
the
exercise
of
that
authority
merely
because
it's
alleged
that
he's
behaved
maliciously,
that
he
did
it
with
the
intention
to
injure
the
plaintiff.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
that
was
a
statement
by
the
postmaster
general
in
which
in
connection
with
payment
of
certain
claims,
he
put
some
statements
in
the
letters
to
the
claimants
which
were
viewed
as
--
but
the
plaintiffs
alleged
were
--
was
--
were
defaming
a
man
who's
been
a
lawyer
for
the
claimants.
but
that
principle,
the
principle
of
spalding
against
vilas
has
been
extended
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
two
cases
to
cover
press
releases
by
cabinet
officers
in
both
glass
against
ickes
and
mellon
against
brewer.
and
those
cases
recognized
that
the
cabinet
officer,
at
least,
was
absolutely
privileged
in
issuing
a
press
release
relating
to
matters
generally
committed
to
his
supervision
and
control
even
though
he
was
not
specifically
authorized
or
requested
to
do
this.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
basic
theory
whether
the
government
official
is
specifically
directed
to
do
something
or
whether
he
does
it
within
the
broad
framework
of
his
power
as
long
as
he
remains
within
that
broad
framework.
now,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
when
it
said
that
the
petitioner
went
outside
his
line
of
duty
in
issuing
the
press
release
has
drawn
an
unduly
narrow
standard
because
what
constitutes
the
line
of
duty
necessarily
has
to
vary
with
the
particular
individual
involved.
in
the
case
of
a
man
of
this
position,
who
was
the
head
of
an
agency,
we
think
that
his
line
of
duty,
as
that
phrase
is
used
by
the
court,
necessarily
includes
the
taking
of
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
obtain
adequate
publicity
for
the
work
of
his
agency.
and
here,
this
agency
had
been
subjected
to
very
serious
criticism
and
we
think
he
was
fully
warranted
in
the
circumstances
in
issuing
a
press
release
explaining
that
he
did
not
condone
this
plan
and
that
he
was
taking
disciplinary
proceedings
against
the
author
of
that
plan.
and
i
don't
put
it
a
little
differently
that
when
you
redeal
with
an
official
of
this
rank
but
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
cabinet
officer,
his
line
of
duty
is
not
limited
to
things
which
he
is
specifically
charged
with
doing
in
the
sense
that
there's
a
regulation
directing
him
to
do
it
but
broadly
covers
all
acts
having
more
of
a
less
connection
with
the
general
matters
committed
by
law
to
his
supervision
of
--
and
control.
and
i
want
to
again
emphasize
that
a
rule
which
would
require
a
high
government
official
to
litigate
his
good
faith
in
the
issuance
of
a
press
release
would
inevitably
result
and
that
people
of
this
level
would
hesitate
if
they
had
any
doubt
as
to
whether
this
might
subsequently
be
misconstrued
as
to
whether
it
could
be
argued
if
they
were
malicious,
they'd
be
conservative.
they
would
hesitate
to
put
out
information
to
the
public
even
though
they
believe
that
the
public
should
have
this
information
and
even
though,
equally
important
from
the
other
side
of
the
fence,
the
public
should
have
the
right
to
this
information.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think,
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
that
in
dealing
with
this,
we
have
to
start
with
the
assumption
that
a
government
official
holding
an
important
post
is
perhaps
the
best
one
qualified
to
know
what
carrying
out
his
duties
requires
in
the
way
of
giving
adequate
publicity.
now,
if
a
government
official
is
abusing
his
trust,
if
he
is
wantonly
issuing
press
releases
defaming
people,
there
are
other
remedies
in
terms
of
carrying
on
the
overall
government
functions.
he
can
be
removed
from
the
office.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
of
those
statistics.
i
know
there
are
a
fair
number
of
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
i
think
to
some
extent
the
amount
of
this
litigation
may
have
been
restricted
by
what
had
previously
been
regarded
as
a
well
set
of
rule
that
action
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
by
a
government
official
was
absolutely
privileged.
i
think
these
--
these
--
this
case
and
the
next
case
are
the
only
two
cases
of
any
appellate
courts,
federal
appellate
courts
that
i
know
with
the
exception
of
the
marshall
case
which
upheld
a
government
official
responsible
for
defamation
in
the
course
his
official
duty
and
there
are
host
cases
the
other
way.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
mr.
justice,
because
we
think
this
is
an
inherent
function,
an
inherent
power
of
the
agency
and
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
it
comes
from
--
inherent
in
the
basic
statute
creating
the
agency,
includes
the
right
to
--
it
take
all
steps
necessary
effectively
to
function,
including
the
right
to
issue
any
publicity
that
is
necessary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
courts
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
in
every
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
oh,
yes.
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
depending
on
basically
the
function
that
he
was
performing,
we
extend
his
responsibilities,
to
what
extent
he
had
discretion
and
freedom
to
act,
to
what
extent
he
had
to
do
things
only
upon
the
approval
of
the
subordinates
in
a
sense
that
he
might
is
a
command
type
of
responsibility
be
in
his
own
capacity
had
the
responsibility
for
carrying
out
an
important
program.
i
would
say
that
in
that
situation,
he
would
be
entitled
who
should
have
this
immunity.
in
other
words,
if
it's
a
kind
of
a
function
where
you
could
fairly
say
that
it's
necessary
for
him
to
have
this
immunity
in
order
to
encourage
him
to
carry
out
his
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
again,
i
think
that
the
high
official
who
tends
--
who
is
more
stouthearted,
even
he
might
be
restrained
by
the
fear
of
this
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
agree
and
i
suggest
that
perhaps
the
reason
for
this
distinction
is
that
the
first
case,
which
involved
this
problem,
which
came
before
this
court
did
involve
a
cabinet
officer
and
i
think
that
set
the
pattern
and
then
the
case
filled
it
down.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
today,
many
very
important
government
functions
are
performed
by
people
below
cabinet
rank
and
that
if
you
attempted
to
limit
it
to
cabinet
rank
as
has
apparently
has
been
suggested,
simply
there
will
be
whole
areas
where
people
have
individual
responsibilities
i
suppose,
for
example,
the
secretaries
of
the
services
are
no
longer
considered,
i
suppose,
as
cabinet
rank
technically.
and
similarly,
in
the
independent
agency
field,
independent
agencies
today
have
vast
power
and
in
many
of
these
areas,
publicity
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
effective
functioning
of
the
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
and
i
would
think
that
it's
just
as
important
to
the
public
interest
that
they
be
given
the
same
measure
of
exemption
from
liability
to
encourage
them
to
carry
out
their
duties
as
the
cabinet
officers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
like
to
suggest
one
analogy
which
is
the
development
of
the
privilege
with
respect
to
judicial
proceedings.
originally,
this
proceeding,
the
privilege
covered
only
the
actions
of
the
judge.
but
since
it
was
recognized,
the
protection
of
the
institution
of
the
judiciary
required
not
only
that
the
judge
be
given
the
privilege
but
all
the
people
who
are
necessary
parties
to
the
judicial
proceeding
be
covered.
it's
been
extended
and
it
now
covers
counsel,
witnesses
and
juries
and
so
forth
and
this
to
us
indicates
the
importance
of
this
privilege
in
protecting
the
basic
institution
that
is
necessary
for
the
privilege
to
exist
in
order
that
the
institution
may
continue
to
function
effectively
to
perform
the
important
public
tasks
for
which
it
was
created
and
to
make
sure
that
in
the
effect
of
functioning
of
this
institution,
the
people
responsible
for
it
feel
free
to
say
whatever
they
think
is
necessary
to
carry
out
that
task.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
probably
not
as
a
general
proposition.
but
i
would
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
judge's
functions
in
this
context
is
somewhat
different
than
those
of
the
members
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
the
--
just
as
his
function
is
completed
after
he
has
decided
the
case
and
rendered
his
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think,
again,
it
might
turn
on
the
particular
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
--
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
can't
answer
it
in
general
terms
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
probably
not
because
i
don't
think
that
would
be
part
of
his
official
functions
as
the
clerk
of
this
court
to
be
issuing
press
releases.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
however,
if
you
directed
him
to
issue
such
a
press
release,
then
he
would
have
immunity
if
that
function
had
been
specifically
delegated
or
if
by
custom
it
was
the
function
of
the
clerk
of
this
court
to
issue
press
releases
explaining
pending
cases,
then
i
think
he
would
have.
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
you
put
the
case
in
terms
of
malice,
that's
a
particular
difficult
case,
i
think.
but
i
suggest
that,
if
the
clerk
of
this
court
issues
malicious
press
releases,
that
his
authority
can
be
taken
away.
but
if
the
problem
as
i
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
if
the
clerk
of
this
court
were
directed
as
part
of
his
duties
to
issue
press
releases
whenever
he
thought
it
was
necessary
and
appropriate,
the
problem
as
we
see
it
is
whether
he
should
be
penalized,
in
effect,
put
on
the
--
in
a
situation
where
every
time
he
issues
a
press
release,
even
though
he
thinks
it's
necessary
and
believes
it's
important
to
the
functioning
of
this
court,
that
he
should
have
to
say,
“well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
let
me
see.
maybe
i
better
not
issue
it.”
and
the
result,
we
think,
in
that
situation
not
only
in
this
court
but
in
the
case
of
all
the
people
counting
on
policy
making
functions
would
be
that
he
would
hesitate
to
issue
an
information
which
is
necessary
to
the
person.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
draw
the
distinction,
the
basic
distinction
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
--
i'd
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
that
normally,
responsible
government
officials
will
exercise
caution
into
the
extent
that
they
will
not
ordinarily
throw
out
these
wild
charges
without
any
ground.
but
i
think
that
as
to
where
our
government
has
developed
that
there
is
this
great
need
for
information
to
be
distributed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
or
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
was
given
by
learned
hand
when
he
said
that
if
you
could
be
sure
that
litigation
of
this
type
could
be
restricted
to
the
cases
where
there
was
really
a
malice,
which
is
really
malicious,
“of
course,
it
would
be
monstrous,”
he
said,
to
deny
recovery.
but
there
are
many
areas
where
it
can
easily
be
alleged
it
was
malicious
and
then
the
official
finds
himself
forced
to
try
to
justify
some
subsequent
data
bona
fide
and
i
think
it's
basically
a
balancing
of
the
public
interest
that
this
court
stated
when
it
remanded
this
case
previously
to
the
court
of
appeals,
passed
on
the
question
of
qualified
privilege,
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
person
who
have
been
injured
on
the
one
hand
and
the
protection
of
the
public
interest
in
the
right
to
know.
and
we
just
think
that
when
this
is
balanced,
that
the
balance
favors
protecting
the
public's
right
to
know
and
encouraging
free
expression
and
action
by
officials
and
therefore,
that
absolute
privilege
would
protect
the
official
from
having
to
justify
himself
at
some
later
date
as
to
the
place
where
it's
public
knowledge.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
qualified
privilege
does
the
very
thing
that
we
think
is
necessary
to
prevent
by
the
absolute
truth,
that
is,
if
you
have
only
a
qualified
privilege
in
every
case,
the
official
knows
that
if
he
does
act
and
he
thinks
it's
reasonable,
he
nonetheless
at
some
future
time
may
be
called
out
to
defend
his
actions
before
a
jury
dealing
with
such
intangibles
with
malice,
whether
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
the
truth
of
what
he
said,
whether
it's
publication
went
beyond
what
was
necessary.
all
of
these
intangible
factors
which
we
think
will
seriously
inhibit
him
in
the
performance
of
his
official
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
retrial
on
certain
issues
with
respect
to
qualified
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
drew
a
distinction
between
duty
in
the
sense
of
an
affirmative
obligation.
that
this
is
something
he
has
to
do
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
duty
in
the
broad
discretionary
sense.
we
think
it
will
develop
in
the
next
case
that
if
there's
an
affirmative
duty,
he
is
entitled
to
the
immunity.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
he's
carrying
out
an
official
order,
if
he's
doing
what
he's
directed
to
do.
but
this
case
involves
a
man
who
has
got
the
area
of
discretion
in
the
performance
of
his
--
he's
not
specifically
charged
as
we
shall
show
in
the
next
case
where
he
was
specifically
charged.
his
duty
was
sending
something.
that's,
we
think,
a
different
case.
the
man
was
required
to
make
a
report
to
his
superiors.
there,
we
think
clearly
in
the
case
that
it
consistently
held
that
there
is
an
absence
of
immunity
in
that
situation.
we're
dealing
here,
we
think,
with
the
case
of
a
broader
area,
a
discretionary
officer
who
has
a
broad
discretion
for
carrying
out
his
duties
of
which
we
think
includes
the
right
to
carry
out
and
issue
whatever
press
releases
are
necessary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
no,
mr.
justice,
the
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
but
then
when
this
court
vacated
and
remanded
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
remanded
proceedings,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
qualified
privilege.
that's
set
forth
at
page
50
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
held
that
there
was
a
qualified
privilege
and
then
they
said
that
he
had
not
--
the
petitioner
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice,
if
this
court
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
we're
not
raising
here
any
question
with
respect
to
qualified
privilege
because
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
stated
that
the
matter
would
have
to
go
to
the
jury
to
pass
on
certain
questions
of
qualified
privilege.
if
this
court
agrees
with
us
that
there
is
an
absolute
privilege
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us,
then
it
goes
back
and
it
goes
back
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
consider
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
rejected
the
defense
of
absolute
privilege.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
if
that
defense
were
accepted,
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
the
--
you've
got
the
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
is
no
absolute
privilege
in
this
situation.
i
suggest
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
might,
but
that
it
seems
to
us
would
require
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
do
the
very
thing
which
we
think
the
doctrine
of
absolute
privilege
was
designed
to
put
a
void,
that
is
litigating
the
question
of
his
good
faith,
litigating
the
question
whether
he
had
reasonable
grounds
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
because
that's
an
important
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
considering
the
policy
issue
here,
my
opponent
has
suggested
that
no
public
official
has
any
need
maliciously
to
defame
citizens.
well,
of
course,
nobody
is
suggesting
that
it's
necessary
to
give
the
public
official
the
right
to
defame
citizens
in
order
that
he
may
do
his
duties
fearlessly.
but
we
are
contending
if
that
in
order
to
his
duty
fearlessly,
it
is
necessary
that
he
have
the
right
to
take
such
steps
as
he
deems
proper
without
fear
that
in
some
particular
case
he
may
be
challenged.
i
think
the
policy
--
the
basic
theory
of
the
policy
is
that
you
don't
look
to
the
particular
case.
it's
a
broad
policy.
you
try
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
people
as
a
whole
and
having
their
government
officials
carry
on
their
functions
as
they
deem
necessary
for
their
important
offices
to
make
the
fullest
amount
of
information
available
to
the
people
and
because
in
a
particular
case,
it
is
alleged
that
a
particular
official
in
carrying
out
his
acts,
acted
maliciously,
acted
out
of
base
motives.
that
is
no
reason
to
destroy
the
privilege
and
to
say
that
the
court
in
this
particular
case,
the
action
is
improper,
therefore,
we're
going
to
say
that
all
government
officials
in
this
situation
must
stand
up
at
some
future
date
before
a
jury
and
attempt
to
prove
their
good
faith.
now,
three
things
that
i'd
like
to
answer,
specifically,
that
mr.
scott
suggested
with
respect
to
the
power
of
mr.
barr
as
the
head
of
this
agency,
the
fact
he
conceded
that
mr.
barr
had
the
power
to
suspend
and
fire
his
employees.
in
fact,
that
the
employees
had
the
right
of
appeal
to
a
higher
agency,
it
seems
to
me,
does
not
mean
that
he
cannot
be
deemed
to
have
the
control
over
these
agencies
which
establishes
him
as
the
head
of
an
important
agency.
we
also
like
to
answer
the
question
which
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked.
we
disagree,
most
emphatically,
with
mr.
scott
that
the
test
is
rank.
we
think
that's
an
artificial
test.
we
think
it
has
to
be
the
function
which
the
official
performs
because
depending
on
a
particular
area
of
government
involved,
in
one
case,
a
cabinet
officer
maybe
performing
certain
functions,
in
another
situation,
a
man
of
a
lower
rank
may
be
performing
just
as
important
functions.
and
the
way
the
executive
departments
of
the
government
are
operating
today,
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
cabinet
officer
himself
cannot
hope
to
perform
all
of
the
important
policy
functions
in
government.
we
think
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
draw
the
line
of
the
level
of
the
cabinet
officer
and
say,
“that's
as
far
as
it
goes,
that
in
effect
we'll
be
saying
that
only
cabinet
officers
are
performing
so
important
functions
as
to
require
that
they
be
given
this
immunity.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
take
basically
the
--
the
kind
of
function
this
man
is
performing.
is
he
in
a
position
of
official
responsibility
that
he
has
responsibility
for
carrying
out
a
particular
program
and
therefore
that
the
public
interest
requires
that
he
be
given
this
kind
of
privilege?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
has
discretion.
he
--
he
does
not
have
to
look
at
every
turn
to
his
superiors
to
decide
what
to
do.
he
--
he
is
the
man
who
is
actually
making
the
decisions,
the
important
policy
decision.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
--
i
think
there's
a
difference,
mr.
justice.
i
think
where
the
man
has
an
affirmative
obligation,
then
i
think
he'd
entitled
to
the
privilege
no
matter
what
his
rank.
in
other
words,
if
he
has
choice
but
to
do
this,
then
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
the
privilege.
when
he's
at
the
policy-making
level
and
it's
a
matter
of
discretion,
then
i
think
as
long
as
he
is
at
that
certain
function,
he's
entitled
to
--
which
i
shall
argue
in
the
next
case
in
a
moment.
in
that
situation,
the
petitioner
in
our
next
case
is
we
don't
think
had
the
same
kind
of
discretion.
he
was
under
an
affirmative
obligation
to
carry
out,
to
do
what
he
did.
thank
you,
your
honor.
