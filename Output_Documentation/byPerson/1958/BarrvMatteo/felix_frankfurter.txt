who
determines,
mr.
friedman,
what
positions
are,
i'm
referring
to
the
order
modifying
the
court's
opinion,
who
determines,
who
--
what
--
who
officers
whose
positions
are
comparable
to
those
of
the
cabinet
officer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
for
the
20
years,
persons
that
held
the
cabinet
meetings,
all
sorts
of
officials
and
i
don't
mean
just
called
in
occasionally,
where
an
english
prime
minister
calls
to
the
minister
was
not
a
member
of
the
cabinet
but
a
regular
attendant.
cabinet
meetings
have
become
town
meetings
in
the
white
house
only.
how
--
or
if
the
courts
says,
how
do
you
determine
whether
that
is
comparable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
my
young
days
in
washington,
the
commission
of
indian
affairs
was
one
of
--
one
of
the
most
important
of
officials.
he
had
a
--
he
had
a
function
and
a
public
significance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
some
sleeping
cabinet
member.
i
don't
mean
a
particular
one
in
the
office
was
very
much
in
the
political
limelight,
if
he
should
be,
would
he
then
have
been
incomparable
to
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
think
he
might
argue
the
other
way?
the
higher
the
officer,
the
more
--
the
more
you
might
expect
from
him
not
to
indulge
in
defamation,
not
to
be
restricted
by
these
inhibiting
fears
that
if
he
talks,
he'd
get
into
trouble.
people
in
high
position
(inaudible)
to
expect
--
you
expect
them
to
be
stouthearted
and
courageous,
et
cetera,
whereas
the
fellow
down
the
line,
he
ought
not
to
make
it
when
any
such
demand
upon
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
he
might.
all
i'm
saying
is
except
on
the
principle
to
him
that
perhaps
shall
be
given
by
the
cabinet
officer,
should
he
allowed
to
roam
at
large
whereas
somebody
in
charge
of
very
important
functions
of
government,
but
not
as
cabinet
officer
should
run
the
hazard
of
lawsuits
to
raise
the
questions
in
my
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that's
something
that's
relatively
recent
in
government,
the
number
of
officials
that
are
attached
directly
to
the
executive
office,
directly
attached
to
the
president,
any
kind
of
a
chart
they'd
run
down
from
the
president
and
under
the
cabinet
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
under
his
personal
responsibility
and
they
are
liable
to
nobody
except
the
president.
i
should
think
they
are
a
beast
of
evil
as
a
cabinet
officer
from
whether
it
fills
any
rule
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
commit
myself
to
that.
i
simply
meant
that
if
the
course
composes
scrutiny
and
you'll
retain
your
--
the
position,
the
activity
of
(a)
the
cabinet
and
(b)
the
functionalities
that
aren't
members
of
the
cabinet
at
all.
the
whole
--
the
whole
operations
of
the
government
which
have
now
impact
in
the
significance,
that
the
same
cabinet
and
non-cabinet
doesn't
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
--
does
your
brief
have
an
appendix
in
which
you
set
forth
the
systematic
watchfulness
of
the
press
in
the
frequency
or
infrequency
with
which
public
officials
give
press
conferences
in
this
time?
you
couldn't
have
such
an
appendix.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
(inaudible)
regularly.
there
are
regular
statistics
on
the
frequency
or
infrequency
in
which
cabinet
officers
and
other
high
officials
hold
press
conferences
and
their
editorial
powers
are
suspended
for
holding
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
i
didn't
quite
--
no,
i
didn't
at
all
understand
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
as
to
what
the
posture
--
where
we
are
in
this
case.
i
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
merely
decided
there
is
no
absolute
privilege.
isn't
that
all
they've
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
they
wouldn't
go
into
qualified
privilege
because
there's
a
waiver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
--
if
the
court
want
to
agree
with
you,
that
--
that
would
be
an
end
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
cannot
escape
in
deciding
this
case
staying
soundly
to
the
problem
of
qualified
privilege.
or
don't
you
have
to
give
any
heed
to
that
on
the
theory
that
that
goes
back
anyhow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
--
are
you
prepared
to
say
on
the
quest
of
jurisdiction
that
we
are
to
consider
the
question
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
--
but
are
we
--
is
the
question
of
absolute
privilege
open
to
us
on
any
--
with
due
regard
to
our
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
sort
of
a
contingent
appeal
then,
isn't
it,
for
qualified
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
you
go
back
to
trial,
it's
the
same
with
qualified
privilege.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
answer
to
my
--
should
we
say
to
my
difficulty,
is
not
merely
that
he
did
it
but
he
had
a
right
to
do
it
because
the
review
of
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
require
finality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
ask
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
any
rule
of
law
that
isn't
expressed
in
absolute
terms,
you
get
back
that
you
draw
a
line
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
--
that
you
can
completely
draw
a
line?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
true
of
a
case
500
odd
people
in
this
land.
they
can
say
anything
they
please
across
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hill
as
i
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
judges
are
there
in
this
land?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
in
any
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
think
that's
the
technical
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
i
know
politics
to
protect
themselves
and
protect
themselves
out
of
general
responsibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
got
some
reason,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
policy
as
to
whether
the
relevant
policy
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
necessity,
you
mean
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
necessity,
you
mean
courts
couldn't
function
if
they
didn't
have
that
immunity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
been
held
that
they
haven't
got
the
immunity
but
it
couldn't
be
held
they
couldn't
function
without
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
go
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
public
administrators
are
more
--
ought
to
be
held
to
a
higher
degree
of
fearlessness
than
justice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
really
looking
them
in
the
--
little
justice
of
the
peace.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
to
fire
a
(voice
overlap)
people
are
constantly
fired
from
the
public
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure,
more,
lower
officials
have
been
fired
than
members
of
the
cabinet
have
been
fired
the
members
of
the
cabinet
have
been
fired
in
our
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
fellow,
this
officer
a
civil
service
man,
who
worried
about
civil
service
rule?
is
this
covered
in
his
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
scott,
you're
--
the
ickes
case
shed
some
light
on
our
problem
because
mr.
ickes
was
a
true
guy.
he
was
not
only
a
cabinet
member,
but
he
was
an
administrator
of
this
and
a
chairman
of
that,
not
by
virtue
of
his
cabinet
position
but
because
he
was
so
appointed
to
those
states.
so
you
might
--
if
you
restricted
the
cabinet
members
--
you
might
have
mr.
ickes
immunized
when
he
spoke
as
secretary
of
the
interior
but
not
when
spoke
as
oil
administrator,
is
that
right?
that
might
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
already
spoke
vividly
in
what
ever
he
spoke,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
have
press
release
in
those
days.
vilas
goes
back
to
cleveland
status,
they
didn't
have
press
releases.
that
was
an
innocent
society.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
vilas.
