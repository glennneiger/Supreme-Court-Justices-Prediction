justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
then
i
ask
you
one
thing
--
one
further
step.
supposing
the
director
of
economic
stabilization
had
gone
on
to
do
precisely
what
petitioner
did
which
would
you
then
be
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
may
you,
sir.
is
it
a
--
is
this
a
matter
of
absolute
or
qualified
privilege
one
of
rank
or
one
--
or
a
matter
of
duty?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
why?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
disbarred,
that
he
was
simply
barred
by
reasonable
of
the
fact
that
he's
an
employee
of
the
department
within
two
years.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
debarred,
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
as
i
understand
the
distinctions
you
made
there
has
to
do
only
with
the
extent
of
the
publication,
but
do
you
contend
that
in
the
ickes's
case,
the
secretary
was
exonerated
simply
because
he
was
secretary
that
is
on
rank
or
because
he
was
performing
a
duty
incident
results?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
--
is
why
is
that?
is
that
because
of
rank
or
because
it
is
a
duty
of
this
official
to
report
up.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
somebody
had
to
make
an
explanation,
however,
to
senator
williams
and
the
others
who
complained
about
this
conduct
in
the
senate.
who
would
be
--
have
been
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
hesitate
to
interrupt
you
again,
but
suppose
that
this
petitioner
had
written
only
to
some
(inaudible)
the
very
matter
contained
in
the
complaint
of
press
release
is
libelous.
the
only
distinction
between
my
assumption
and
what
was
done
would
be
the
extent
of
the
publication,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
would
the
letter
have
been
absolutely
privileged
in
your
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
it
had
been
written
by
his
superior,
the
director
of
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
economic
stabilization
administration,
do
you
say
that
it
would
still
not
have
been?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
the
latter
was
appointed
by
the
president
of
united
states.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
if
it
had
been
done
by
the
president
of
united
states,
would
he
have
immunity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
why?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
noticed
that
judge
danaher
addressed
in
his
dissent
in
the
first
case,
the
department
is,
that
the
--
the
executive
power
had
been
delegated
down
to
the
secretary
of
economic
stabilization
to
this
petitioner.
do
you
think
there's
anything
in
that?
