mr.
byron
n.
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
associate
justices
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
true
significance
and
the
total
impact
of
this
particular
case
is
elucidated
by
the
question
that
was
asked
in
the
close
of
mr.
solicitor
general's
argument
by
mr.
justice
black
why
shouldn't
everybody
in
government
be
immune?
mr.
byron
n.
scott
exactly,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
that
is
what
the
government
has
contended
for,
not
the
drawing
of
a
line
but
if
it
can
be
made
out
the
duty
of
an
official
or
if
it
is
something
that
he
does
that
has
some
relationship
to
his
official
duty,
then
they
say
he
should
have
immunity
from
suit
for
defamation
of
character.
and
it
is
government
officialdom
against
people
and
i
think
that
i
have
here
the
right
to
speak
for
people
and
that
for
years
from
the
beginning,
the
law
says
that
if
somebody
speaks
falsely
of
me
and
it
holds
me
up
to
ridicule
or
to
tempt
or
obliquely
before
people
that
i
am
entitled
to
come
in
to
the
court
and
have
my
remedy
against
him
for
destroying
my
good
name
and
my
reputation.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
mr.
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
--
i
--
my
next
comment
was
to
be
that
there
are
exemptions
to
that
rule.
one
of
them
is
created
by
the
constitution.
one
of
them
says
that
no
member
of
congress,
be
it
a
senator
or
a
congressman
can
be
held
liable
for
words
spoken
in
the
chambers
in
debate.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
the
second
exemption
that
has
been
made
to
the
general
rule
is
in
the
case
of
courts.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
it's
not
in
the
course
--
in
the
constitution.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
it
is
court
made.
it
was
held
and
this
was
determined
that
a
judge
acting
within
his
jurisdiction,
if
he
had
jurisdiction
to
act,
could
not
be
held
liable
for
anything
that
transpired
within
the
court
proceeding.
then
that
has
been
extended
to
phase
out
judicial
proceedings.
and
it
has
been
necessary
to
pleading
and
it
has
been
extended
to
testimony,
unless
the
testimony
or
the
pleadings
were
very
much
irrelevant.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
i
think
it's
a
rule.
it
has
been
made
for
the
courts
and
i
think
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
it
has
reason,
but
high
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
it
has
policy
behind
it
and
that's
what
the
--
what
the
solicitor
general
said,
that
this
is
a
question
of
public
policy,
to
what
extent
must
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
his
quite
good
name
and
his
reputation
all
the
way
in
face
of
the
necessity
for
immunity
on
the
part
of
some
officials
to
speak
their
minds
and
to
make
their
act
without
fear
of
being
hauled
in
the
courtroom.
and
that
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
byron
n.
scott
it
has
been
so
held
that
it
is
necessary
for
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
--
them
to
hold,
have
that
immunity.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
no,
it's
never
been
said
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
--
the
court
could
not
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
--
function
without
it,
but
it
was
held
by
the
courts
that
judges
should
have
this
immunity.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
for
the
very
reason
that
--
it
was
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
they
could
not
speak
out
fearlessly
in
the
cases
saying
if
they
thought
they
would
be
held
in
the
court.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
no,
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
judges
and
deputy
directors
are
in
control
officers.
and
may
i
speak
just
a
moment
again
to
the
acceptance.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
justice
of
the
peace
is
appointed
by
us
county
council,
he
may
be
removed
by
the
county
council.
if
he
is
elected
by
the
people,
he
may
not
be
elected
the
next
time
if
he
abuses
the
privileges
of
his
office.
but
take
the
administrative
man
in
the
lower
echelons
of
government.
take
the
deputy
director
of
the
office
of
price
stabilization.
there
is
no
deterrent
to
his
abuse
of
a
privilege
if
granted
it
this
way.
how
do
you
relook
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
and
people
are
constantly
put
back
into
their
jobs
because
several
lawyers
come
along
and
prove
that
the
regulations
have
been
violated
or
the
civil
service
act
has
been
violated
or
this
was
done
because
of
somebody
is
in
discretion
or
it
was
abuse
of
his
discretion.
it
is
difficult,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
fire
a
civil
servant.
it
is
difficult.
it
has
been
done,
but
when
you
compare
the
ease,
look
again
to
the
congressman
and
the
senators,
by
the
immunity,
there
is
a
powerful
detriment
to
the
abuse
of
a
privilege
by
a
congressman
or
a
senator.
he
may
be
censured
by
his
own
by
body,
he
may
be
expelled
by
his
own
body,
he
may
be
defeated
by
the
electorate.
there
is
a
reason
for
distinction
between
members
of
the
president's
cabinet
and
executives
lower
in
the
echelons
of
government.
a
member
of
the
president's
cabinet
may
be
impeached.
judges
may
be
impeached.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
no
doubt
and
i
think
there
are
cases
in
answer
to
a
question
that
was
raised
earlier.
that
there
are
three
cases
in
which
a
press
release
has
libeled
somebody.
there
is
the
case
us
before
here.
there
is
the
case
to
succeed
this
one.
there
is
the
case
of
glass
versus
ickes.
there
hadn't
been
cases
of
this
kind,
your
honors,
because
government
officials
do
know
that
they
or
they
may
have
the
right
to
inform
and
the
duty
to
inform,
they
inform
truthfully.
they
don't
give
vent
to
press
releases
such
as
the
one
before
this
court
where
it
is
called
to
the
attention
of
all
of
the
people
of
the
country
through
the
newspapers
that
this
man,
the
director
--
the
deputy
director
intends
come
next
monday
to
suspend
these
people
because
they
were
responsible
for
the
adoption
of
this
plan
and
the
accusation
to
the
court
and
the
jury
carried
the
implication
that
there
had
been
something
reprehensible.
but
that
wasn't
the
case.
the
press
release
said
these
people
were
responsible.
the
facts
were
that
this
agency
was
about
to
expire.
everybody
in
the
agency
was
looking
for
some
way
to
keep
the
agency
together
until
they
found
out
whether
congress
was
going
to
create
it
again
and
give
it
money
to
operate.
and
the
director
of
personnel
and
management
where
the
responsibility
rested
said
to
his
director,
“we
might
do
it
this
way.”
his
director
and
this
is
in
the
record,
his
director
said,
“that's
difficult
to
understand.
we
won't
do
it
over
the
entire
agency.”
and
later,
they
came
back
to
the
director
and
said,
“some
people
want
to
do
it,
they
will
do
it
if
we
ask
them
to.”
and
the
director
of
the
agency,
not
this
man
who
is
here
as
petitioner,
but
the
director
of
the
agency
said,
“all
right,
if
they
want
to
do
it,
it
is
all
right
with
me.”
there
was
responsibility,
yet
the
press
release
said
that
these
people
were
responsible.
it
was
all
done
in
the
openness
way,
in
the
determination
of
whether
this
plan
would
or
would
not
be
used.
it
was
discussed
there
was
nothing
surreptitious.
and
then
it
came
--
the
issuance
of
the
press
release
by
and
i
make
the
distinction
and
i
think
it's
important
--
the
deputy
director
who
said,
“when
i
become
the
acting
director,
i
am
going
to
suspend.”
he
said
in
his
press
release,
“i
don't
have
the
authority
to
do
it
now.
monday,
when
i
become
acting
director,
will
be
the
first
time
that
i've
been
able
or
have
the
power
to
take
any
action.”
and
on
monday,
the
following
monday,
he
issued
this
suspension
order.
now,
the
question
was
raised
in
different
ways
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man,
the
petitioner,
was
the
head
of
an
independent
executive
agency,
whether
that
he
was
the
head
of
an
executive
agency,
whether
he
was
the
head
of
an
independent
agency
and
if
this
power,
if
this
immunity
for
government
officials
who
may
issue
press
releases
to
have
immunity
from
defamation
no
matter
what
they
say
or
what
may
be
their
minds,
i
can
see,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
no
reason
other
than
the
deterrent
principle
of
restricting
it
to
the
top
man
of
the
cabinet,
the
president
he
hasn't.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
which
says
that
the
president
may
issue
a
press
release
upon
an
individual
citizen
and
detain
him
would
you
give
him
an
immunity.
i
don't
know
why
this
man
as
the
head
of
this
agency
should
have
that
power.
was
he
the
head
of
the
independent
agency?
what
happened
is
(inaudible).
he
issued
the
--
issued
the
suspension
notice
and
appeal
was
taken
by
two
employees
to
the
head
of
the
esa,
the
economic
stabilization
agency
of
which
the
office
of
rent
stabilization
was
a
branch.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
not
a
presidential
appointee
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
--
and
he
was
in
the
classified
service
of
--
rather
than
being
on
accepted
status,
he
was
a
civil
service
employee
with
status.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
he
was
appointed
by
the
director
of
the
economic
stabilization
administration
who
at
that
time
was
acting,
mr.
(inaudible)
who
later
replaced
by
dr.
fleming
who
is
now
secretary
of
atw.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
mr.
justice
clark,
i'm
embarrassed
because
i
don't
know
whether
the
petitioner
was
or
was
not
a
veteran.
if
he
was
a
veteran,
yes,
he
would
have
had
an
appeal
to
the
commission,
the
--
the
director
--
we're
talking
now
the
deputy
director.
he
would
have
had
an
appeal
if
he
were
a
preference
eligible,
a
veteran.
he
would
have
had
appealed
to
the
civil
service
commission.
his
appointment
did
not
require
confirmation
by
the
senate.
he
occupied
no
political
position
as
such.he
had
been
deputy
director
under
the
truman
administration.
he
became
acting
director
under
the
eisenhower
administration.
he
was
not
a
political
appointee.
but
after
he
issued
his
notice
of
suspension
that
was
appealed,
an
appeal
if
you
please
to
his
direct
superior,
the
head
of
the
economic
stabilization
administration.
a
hearing
was
held.
it
was
recommended
that
the
suspension
be
cancelled.
but
the
head
of
the
parent
agency,
esa
said,
“no,
i'm
going
to
let
the
suspension
stand.”
and
then
the
petitioner
here
as
head
of
rent
stabilization,
fired
the
two
people,
ordered
them
separated
from
the
government.
they
took
an
appeal
again
to
the
head
of
the
economic
stabilization
administration
and
he
reversed
and
the
people
were
put
back
to
work.
now,
if
this
man
were
the
head
of
an
independent
agency,
he
would
have
the
firing
power,
not
his
superior,
he
was
answerable
to.
now,
as
we
have
discuss
the
question
of
this
man's
duty,
of
the
petitioner's
duty
as
the
head
of
this
agency.
what
was
it?
to
determine
whether
these
people
should
or
should
not
in
the
first
instance
be
suspended,
but
that
was
appealable
to
the
head
of
the
economic
stabilization
agency.
then
it
was
his
duty
to
determine
whether
they
should
be
fired,
but
that
was
appealable?
mr.
byron
n.
scott
neither
of
the
two
employees
who
are
here
as
respondents
have
gotten
preference
or
it
would
not
have
gone
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
could
have
gone
there
only
on
the
question
of
a
violation
of
regulations
or
whether
it
was
an
abusive
discretion
to
fire.
they
took
and
necessarily
so,
because
it's
necessary
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies,
they
took
the
route
of
appeal
to
the
esa
director
on
the
firing
and
won
and
were
reinstated.
therefore,
it
would
not
go
to
the
civil
service
commission.
but
what
did
he
--
what
was
his
duty?
mr.
byron
n.
scott
they
were
reinstated.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
entitled
to
a
hearing
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
they
had
a
hearing
on
the
suspension
before
a
board
appointed
by
the
director
of
the
esa
at
the
--
when
they
were
fired
and
they
appealed,
the
director
of
the
esa
did
not
ask
for
a
hearing.
he
just
reversed.
but
they
had
to
have
their
hearing
in
the
suspension
case.
this
man's
duty,
what
was
it?
to
suspend,
certainly.
i
wouldn't
deny
it
for
a
moment
the
right
of
the
head,
of
the
--
and
acting
head
of
the
officer
of
rent
control
to
order
a
suspension
of
an
employee,
or
to
fire
subject
to
appeal.
but
that's
all
he
needed
to
do.
if
he
thought
it
would
be
necessary
because
of
some
speeches
that
has
been
made
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
to
issue
a
press
release,
he
could
have
said,
“i
have
today
had
it
been
true
suspended
two
people,”
the
respondents.
it
wasn't
necessary
for
him
to
go
into
a
discussion,
created
in
his
moment
of
panic,
because
somebody
had
criticized
him
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
it
wasn't
necessary
to
describe
his
reasoning
and
his
thinking.
it
might
have
been
for
him
to
tell
his
superior
why.
and
there
is
where
we
run
in
to
these
cases
of
absolute
immunity
of
a
government
official
doing
his
duty
and
being
protected
in
it.
it's
part
of
the
howard
case.
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
if
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
sent
a
report
to
the
director
of
the
economic
stabilization
administration
saying,
“i
am
going
to
suspend
these
people
for
these
reasons.”
mr.
byron
n.
scott
yes,
but
the
parties
would
be
different.
it
would
be
the
economic
stabilization
administrator
here,
i
think,
as
petitioner
rather
than
the
deputy
director
of
office
rental.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
i
think
that
under
the
decided
cases
and
the
way
the
law
exists
before
this
court
acts,
it's
a
matter
of
rank.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
say
that
because
of
the
glass
versus
ickes
case
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia,
certiorari
denied.
in
that
case,
any
individual
was
representing
himself
to
various
people
in
connection
with
the
connally
hot
oil
bill.
what
he
was
doing
and
the
fact
they're
a
little
too
involved,
i
think,
for
me
to
try
to
elucidate
here,
but
he
was
more
or
less
seeking
clients
before
the
department
of
interior
and
he
had
been
disbarred
from
practice
before
the
interior
department
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
debarred.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
and
that
action
had
been
taken
by
the
secretary,
debarred
him.
and
the
secretary
told
everybody
through
a
press
release,
“you
had
better
not
have
business
with
this
man
because
he
cannot
represent
you
here.”
simply
stated.
that
was
a
press
release.
that
was
notifying
all
of
the
public.
it
was
not
to
an
interested
party.
it
was
not
a
defamatory
piece
of
information
to
somebody
who
had
an
interest
in
receiving
it,
even
though
the
people
--
among
the
people
who
received
it
were
those
who
had
an
interest.
in
the
case
of
spalding
versus
vilas,
a
distinction
between
glass
versus
ickes,
there,
it
was
sent
only
to
people
interested.
here,
it
was
broadly
cited
to
the
entire
public
by
a
press
release
to
inform
because
the
secretary
didn't
know
how
many
people
or
who
they
were
that
this
man
was
trying
to
represent.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
as
i
read
the
decision
of
that
court
i
think
it
was
on
rank
and
that
he
had
a
duty
as
the
political
appointee,
as
the
head
of
the
agency.
it
was
his
duty
to
explain
why.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
barr
case
made
the
distinction
and
said,
“it
wasn't
this
man's
duty
to
explain
the
whys.
it
might
have
been,
although
they
say
we
do
reach
the
question
--
it
might
have
been
the
duty
of
the
economic
stabilization
administrator
to
explain
the
why
of
this
case.”
mr.
byron
n.
scott
it
might
possibly
although
i
don't
know
--
i
have
no
time
when
he
focused
on
administrator.
he
spoke
this
time
as
secretary
of
the
interior
and
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
--
mr.
justice
vinson
in
writing
the
opinion
said
that
it
was
as
a
cabinet
officer.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
i
so
recall.
i
want
to
get
back
a
moment
to
the
other
exceptions
that
have
been
carved
out
of
this
room
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
protection
of
his
good
reputation.
the
principal
one
and
it
seems
to
me,
the
one
that
the
government
has
relied
upon
most
carefully
is
the
one
where
you
make
the
report
to
somebody
who
can
do
something
about
it.
now,
there
are
cases
where
the
subordinate
officer
tells
his
superior
he
has
to.
the
law
requires
it
and
his
superior
acts.
he
has
absolute
immunity,
but
that
some
--
telling
it
to
somebody
who
can
do
something
about
it.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
when
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
it's
the
duty
of
the
official
to
report
up.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
now,
how
high
do
you
have
to
go
before
glass
versus
ickes
would
apply
on
the
decided
cases?
spalding
versus
vilas
does
not
require
a
granting
of
absolutely
immunity
to
anybody
for
issuing
a
defamatory
press
release.
that
wasn't
a
press
release
and
the
court
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
i
don't
go
back
to
cleveland's
time
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
--
and
i
don't
know
anybody
ever
issued
a
press
release
at
that
time
or
not.
but
it
was
not
a
public
statement.
yet,
the
brief
for
the
government
contends
that
it
is
the
basis.
it
is
the
authority
for
immunity
for
public
statements.
the
other
able-to-do
report
to
somebody
who
can
do
something
about
it,
that's
the
case
cooper
versus
o'connor
where
in
the
enforcement
of
law
going
to
grand
juries,
testimony
before
grand
juries
and
the
immunity
there,
they're
reporting
to
officials
who
can
take
action.
why
was
it
necessary
for
this
head
of
this
agency
to
broadcast
this
story
to
the
people
of
why
he
was
firing
these
two
employees?
the
people
that
read
it
couldn't
do
anything
about
it.
it
has
been
done.
and
second,
distinguish
again
from
glass
versus
ickes.
there
wasn't
anybody
out
in
the
country
that
was
doing
any
business
with
these
two
people.
they
were
subordinate
officials
in
the
housing
administration.
they
were
suspended.
they
were
out.
there
wasn't
any
chance
that
somebody
would
walk
in
to
the
office
and
talk
to
them
so
that
the
head
of
the
agency
should
warn
all
people
against
it.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
i
wouldn't
have
had
the
head
of
the
agency
do
it,
either
the
head
of
the
agency
or
in
his
absence
the
petitioner
here
or
a
letter
was
prepared
for
him
and
it
was
signed
by
his
secretary
and
sent
it
to
senator
williams.
there
is
where
it
ends.
it
should
have
been
there
whatever
senator
williams
did
with
it
would
have
been
no
part
of
this
case.
but
where
you
have
been
asked
for
information,
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
his
duty
to
supply
it.
it
was
quickly
all
right
for
this
man,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
holding
the
whole
press
releases.
but
now
you
don't,
in
entering
senator
williams
for
the
questions
he
has
asked
or
the
remarks
he's
made,
go
to
the
public
and
defame
two
of
your
former
employees.
there
was
no
responsibility,
no
duty
on
him
to
do
that.
now,
one
more
and
the
next
exception
to
this
general
rule
that
if
somebody
defames
me,
i
may
have
regrets,
is
asked
for
by
the
government
here.
and
it
is
asked
for,
it
seems
to
me
on
this
basis.
the
public
has
a
right
to
know.public
has
the
right
to
know
the
truth.
and
they
want
us
--
they
want
this
court
to
carve
out
another
field,
another
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
say
that
when
any
government
official
is
performing
and
informers
act
--
no,
that's
not
their
word.
when
they
are
performing
an
informing
function,
when
they
are
telling
people
falsely
about
what
they
think
is
going
on
in
the
government,
make
that
exception
to
the
rule.
if
and
it's
a
case
where
no
law
requires
it,
no
constitutional
provision
requires
it,
no
decided
cases
to
date
requires
it.
they're
asking
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
so
that
the
public
may
know,
to
give
to
employees
at
least
like
this
petitioner
absolute
immunity.
they
refer
to
congress
saying
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
know,
in
the
newspapers
saying
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
know
--
mr.
byron
n.
scott
--
certainly.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
i
think
not,
sir.
i
think
not.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
economic
stabilization
administration.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
under
the
--
the
decided
cases,
it
would
not
have
been.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
esa
director
--
was.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
yes.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
because
he's
the
chief
executive.
as
far
as
i
know
and
as
i
have
said
a
moment
ago,
a
terminal
case
that
would
establish
that
other
than
dicta
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
not
be
as
the
--
the
head
of
the
executive
department,
the
division
(inaudible)
the
system
of
checks
and
balances,
i
think
they
put
it
on
would
not
be
amendable
to
that
court
action.
mr.
byron
n.
scott
the
director
of
the
economic
stabilization
administrator
did
not
receive
all
of
these
powers
and
transfer
all
of
these
powers
without
reserving
any
to
his
director
of
the
office
rent
stabilization.
the
outline
of
his
powers
was
stated
in
appellant's
brief
at
the
first
hearing
of
the
case
where
they
said
he
was
able
--
the
petitioner
--
he
was
able
within
the
limits
of
statutes,
directives
from
his
superior
and
outstanding
governmental
policies
to
determine
fully
the
policy
of
ors
as
to
rent
control
matters.
all
of
his
--
all
of
the
authority
given
to
the
economic
stabilization
administrator
by
the
president
was
not
transferred
by
that
administrator
to
the
head
of
this
office
of
rent
stabilization.
for
example,
he
didn't
even
have
the
authority
that
the
office
--
that
the
administrator
of
the
economic
stabilization
administrator
had
to
fire
his
employees.
he
couldn't
fire
him
and
make
him
stick
--
make
it
stick.
he
had
--
they
had
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
administrator.
and
within
directives
issued
by
esa
down
or
by
policies
adopted
by
the
president,
esa
administrator,
he
followed
those
policies.
no,
your
honor,
i
think
judge
danaher
was
wrong
in
argument
before
on
this
question
of
how
do
you
compare,
how
do
you
determine
whether
they
are
on
cabinet
level
or
not,
we
have
engaged
in
a
--
a
discussion
of
numbers.
there
are
more
employees
in
this
agency
than
there
are,
for
example,
in
labor
department.
therefore,
this
man
should
have
it,
if
this
man
has
that
immunity
which
is
an
unrealistic
attempt
to
determine
whether
to
give
to
the
man,
who
is
the
servant
of
the
people,
the
right
to
defend
those
people,
so
that
he
can
act
fearlessly.
this
man
could
have
acted
fearlessly,
faithfully
without
any
trouble
at
all
by
just
announcing
that
he
had
suspended
these
two
men
or
this
man
and
this
woman.
or
he
could
have
acted
faithfully
and
fearlessly
if
he
had
told
his
superior,
“i
have
suspended
them
for
these
reasons.”
that's
all
he
had
to
do.
and
anything
further,
no
public
interest
necessitates
the
granting
of
immunity
to
a
person
to
do
that
from
a
malicious
motive.
