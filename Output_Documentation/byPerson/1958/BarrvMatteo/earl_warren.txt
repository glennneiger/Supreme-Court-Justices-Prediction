chief
justice
earl
warren
50,
william
g.
barr,
petitioner,
versus
linda
(inaudible)
john
j.
madigan.
mr.
friedman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
is
there
no
alternative
between
those
two
extremes
that
you
speak
off?
is
it
necessary
to
restrain
the
officer
from
saying
the
things
in
his
official
conduct
and
doing
the
things
that
he
is
required
to
do
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
calling
the
press
in
and
--
and
giving
a
press
release
that
might
be
defamatory
on
the
--
and
be
actuated
by
malice?
could
he
not
give
the
information
through
his
official
acts
and
--
and
leave
the
press
conferences
to
--
to
other
considerations
that
were
in
no
sense
defamatory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
to
the
extent
of
saying
anything
--
anything
that
they
want
about
anybody
without
regard
to
the
truth
or
without
regard
to
the
good
motives
or
anything?
do
you
think
that
all
public
officials
should
be
accorded
the
right
to
say
anything
they
want
to
say
about
american
citizens
whether
they're
employees
or
whether
they
are
private
citizens
and
do
that
with
impunity
and
with
immunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
stop,
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
let's
say
that
it
does
have
something
to
do
with
his
official
--
his
official
duty.
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
he
can
say
anything
he
wants
about
anybody
with
impunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
how
would
you
distinguish
between
those
--
those
public
officials
who
were
entitled
and
who
are
presumed
as
matter
of
right
to
give
--
to
inform
the
public
and
those
who
are
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
don't
draw
any
line
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
this
man's
assistant
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
next
one
though,
you
have
the
--
the
head
of
--
for
the
navy
yard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sorry
to
interrupt
just
once
more
and
then
--
and
then
i
won't
bother
your
argument.
but
you
said
he
was
the
acting
director.
chief
justice
earl
warren
once
he's
the
acting
director
at
the
time
he
made
this
press
release,
i
understood
that
he
was
the
deputy
director
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
was
to
be
the
acting
director
some
four
days
later.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
then
if
--
if
the
deputy
director,
he
was
out
of
town
and
you
have
some
regulation
to
subject,
the
next
man,
would
have
an
absolute
privilege
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all
the
--
all
the
way
down
as
far
as
you
want
to
--
want
to
go
in
leaving
town?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
entitlement
depend
on
the
agency
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
the
--
isn't
that
the
independent
agency
and
this
is
just
a
division
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
who
was
his
immediate
superior,
if
anyone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
the
--
the
economic
stabilization
administration
have
--
have
directed
him
as
to
--
to
his
responsibility
for
--
for
making
and
not
making
press
releases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
i
was
about
to
ask
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
a
judge
issue
a
press
conference
after
--
decided
the
case
and
say
anything
he
wants
to
about
any
--
any
citizen
or
any
employee
of
the
government
and
have
immunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
suppose
the
clerk
of
this
court
thought
it
was
carrying
out
the
policy
of
the
--
of
the
court
to
explain
these
relations
to
the
public
and
--
and
issue
the
press
release
which
was
defamatory
of
some
--
some
citizen
and
that
it
was
conceded
that
he
did
it
with
malice,
do
you
think
he
would
have
immunity
from
libel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
the
facts
i
gave
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
do
it
specifically
then.
i
gave
you
the
fact
that
it's
the
clerk
of
this
court
will
say
and
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
necessary
to
explain
the
relations
of
this
court
to
the
--
to
the
public
and
he
took
occasion
to
issue
a
press
release
which
was
both
admittedly
defamatory
and
admittedly
malicious
concerning
someone
who
had
been
in
the
litigation,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
--
would
he
have
immunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
think
that
although
there's
no
statutory
authority
for
it
and
nothing
in
the
constitution
says
we
can.
that
it's
a
question
of
--
of
judgment
on
our
part
whether
we
give
anybody
that
responsibility.
but
if
we
do,
why,
we
give
him
blanket
immunity
to
say
anything
he
wants
to
say
about
anybody
with
malice
concerning
anything
that's
gone
through
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'd
like
this
to
just
carry
on
what
judge
--
justice
harlan
asked
you.
don't
you
think
that
would
be
a
good
thing
for
government
rather
than
to
--
rather
than
to
be
detriment
and
an
injury
to
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
had
--
if
he
had
some
caution
in
doing
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i'm
sure
you
don't
take
from
what
i
say
that
i
object
to
press
conferences.
it's
only
where
they
claim
immunity
from
--
from
libel
for
defaming
somebody
even
with
malice
that
i
--
that
i
question
the
--
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
procedure
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
certainly
press
conferences
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
desirable.
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly
the
public
must
know,
but
does
that
carry
with
it
the
--
the
immunity
to
--
to
one
who
maliciously
defames
the
character
of
another?
there's
a
great
difference
between
the
responsibility
of
--
of
informing
the
public
through
--
through
press
conferences
and
in
--
in
all
other
means
on
the
one
hand,
from
using
those
things
with
malice
to
defame
a
citizen
on
the
other
hand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
couldn't
they
qualify
the
privilege
itself
to
either
balance
what
you
seek?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
we've
taken
so
much
in
your
time
in
questions
and
i
--
i
more
than
anyone
else
that
you
may
have
five
minutes
--
five
minutes
in
rebuttal
if
you
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
scott.
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
these
people
were
reinstated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
