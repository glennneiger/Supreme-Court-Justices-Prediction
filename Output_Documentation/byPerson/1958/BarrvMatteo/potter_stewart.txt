mr.
friedman,
if
the
test
is
not
ranked
that
--
what
is
the
test,
job
content
or
job
responsibility
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
responsibility
is
certainly
not
in
terms
of
the
number
of
people
subordinate
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
mean
that.
you
mean
responsibility
in
that
he
is
a
policy
making
official?
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
has
discretion?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
on
that
basis
that
you
would
contend
that
he
should
have
it
--
this
petitioner
should
have
absolute
immunity.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
succeeding
case
as
i
understand
it,
it's
going
to
be
the
position
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
for
the
exact
opposite
reason
that
he
has
no
discretion,
he
should
have
absolute
immunity,
is
that
correct?
for
getting
pressed,
for
being
premature.
but
i
--
i
just
wonder.
you're
not
just
going
to
cover
the
waterfront
in
these
two
cases.
