which
part
of
that
press
release
is
relied
on
that
did
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
it
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
now
where
did
you
say,
shown
his
authority
to
issue
press
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
do
you
rely
on
that
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
a
press
release?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
your
case
is
as
strong
as
it
would
be
if
congress
had
specifically
authorized
the
giving
of
press
releases
by
this
agency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
why
--
if
it
has
not
come
--
it
didn't
come
from
the
statute,
this
comes
from
the
practice
of
custom
or
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
give
you
just
one
other
question.
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument
in
this
respect.
as
i
gather,
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
officer
like
the
cabinet
officer
has
a
governmental
responsibility.
this
is
not
statutory,
but
you
--
you
assume
now
that
he
has
a
governmental
responsibility
to
give
out
press
statements.
do
you
say
that
any
official,
who
certainly
have
certain
high
rank
in
the
government
has
the
responsibility,
he
should
not
be
held
liable
at
all
even
though
it's
malicious.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
if
that
is
the
case,
should
that
not
apply
to
any
government
agent,
whatever
his
position
who
is
charged
by
the
responsibility
of
law
to
give
press
releases.
what
excuse
could
there
be
for
saying
that
certain
ones
in
high
places
could
get
release
but
the
people
who
are
in
low
places,
who
are
little
less
eager
to
disobey
orders,
sometimes
even
in
those
of
high
places?
why
would
your
argument
would
not
care
all
the
way
to
me?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
their
duty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
it's
their
duty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
regard
to
his
status?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
people
that
were
