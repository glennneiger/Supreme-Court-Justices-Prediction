mr.
marion
e.
sibley
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it's
unfortunate
that
we
found
ourselves
faced
with
the
issue
of
fact
before
a
court
where,
i
should
think,
the
only
problem
to
be
decided
with
one
--
be
one
of
law.
i
tried
18
or
19
of
the
24
or
25
cases
in
which
this
union,
moving
into
miami,
determined
to
organize
with
money
but
without
members.
i
do
not
recognize
the
cases
i
tried
in
the
lower
court
from
the
presentation
of
it
here.
a
statement
of
the
questions
that
we
asked
indicate
a
great
convergence
between
our
views
only
on
the
facts.
our
questions
are
whether
a
state
court
may
enjoin
picketing,
(a)
where
the
objective
sought
to
be
achieved
by
the
pickets
and
the
labor
union
they
--
they
represent
is
unlawful
and
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
the
state,
(b)
the
picket
signs
are
untruthful,
(c)
the
picketing
is
accompanied
by
acts
of
violence
or
near
violence
condemned
by
the
state
labor
statute
and
is
set
in
the
background
of
coercion
and
tension.
two,
when
to
intensify
the
economic
pressure
generated
by
the
unlawful
picket
line,
the
union
engaged
in
false
advertising
may
a
state
court
lawfully
enjoin
all
of
the
concerted
unlawful
and
fraudulent
acts
which
form
a
part
of
the
union's
scheme
to
impose
economic
sanction
upon
the
employer.
and
three,
and
really
the
only
legal
question
involved
in
this
case,
is
whether
or
not
the
national
labor
relations
act
protect
the
union
from
court
action
in
its
unlawful,
fraudulent
and
violent
picketing.
now,
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
in
reciting
and
making
a
short
reciting
of
facts
to
turn
to
each
page
of
the
record
that
had
been
to
this
court.
i
shall
begin,
if
your
honors
please,
at
the
beginning.
in
january
1955
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
--
certainly,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
do
not
take
the
court
is
--
is
asking
too
much.
it
has
been
admitted
here
that
the
false
advertising
consisted
in
the
advertisement
in
all
newspapers
by
the
union
that
strikes
were
in
progress
at
these
hotels.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
their
answer,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
if
the
court
will
turn,
and
i
anticipated
that
question,
by
the
record,
if
the
court
will
turn
in
the
answer
file,
and
this
was
the
answer
file
in
all
of
the
cases,
they
had
a
stock
answer
that
they
filed,
i
think
it
would
be
found
on
page
23,
paragraph
(7)
of
that
answer,
denies
that
there
was
a
strike
in
progress
at
the
hotels.
they,
themselves,
took
that
position
that
no
strike
--
strike
was
in
progress
at
the
hotels.
we
had
taken
the
position
that
they
had
attempted
to
--
this
was
our
original
position,
they
had
attempted
to
strike
without
taking
a
secret
vote
as
required
by
the
florida
statute.
and
they
responded
in
their
answer
and
we
found
it
to
be
true
afterwards
that
in
truth,
there
was
no
strike
whatever
at
the
hotels.
in
fact,
it
was
established
that
in
some
hotels
and
some
in
these
records,
they
didn't
even
represent
more
employee
in
the
hotel
at
the
time
to
put
the
picket
line
up.
so
obviously,
there
couldn't
be
a
strike.
obviously,
they
pressure
the
picket
line
and
drove
those
away
who
didn't
throw
up
away.
and
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
florida
answers
that
and
unless,
unless
this
court
overrules
a
finding
of
fact
in
which
this
--
they
failed
to
bring
up
the
record
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
pin
its
opinion.
why,
its
--
that
could
be
concluded
that
they
did
not
represent
these
people
and
they
were
not
members
of
the
union.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
mean
this,
your
honor,
on
page
15,
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
it,
of
our
brief.
and
on
16,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
finds
in
the
boca
raton
case
that
they
represented
an
insignificant
number
of
the
employees
as
shown
by
the
designation
cards
put
in
by
the
union
itself
to
establish
that
it
represented
the
employees.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
boca
raton
case,
your
honor,
which
governed
six
--
governed
two
other
cases
that
are
here
now.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
was
used
to
the
authoritative
to
affirm
two
of
the
cases
here
or
--
or
revised
two
of
the
cases
here
when
the
court
dissolve
the
injunctive
order.
now,
let
me
explain.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
all
right,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
boca
--
yes,
sir.
the
frontenac
case
and
the
sans
souci
case
are
here.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
they're
here,
but
this
is
the
opinion
in
the
boca
raton
case
that
were
taken
up
as
one
appeal
or
as
a
consolidated
appeal.
their
opinion
was
only
written
in
the
boca
raton
case
and
merely
a
per
curiam
in
the
other
two
cases
that
this
is
the
authority
for
our
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that
is
correct.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
of
course,
that
is
one
of
our
positions
that
if
they
wish
to
demonstrate
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
made
an
error
of
fact,
they
should
have
brought
the
records
up
here
to
demonstrate
it.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
may
i
--
it's
difficult
to
be
--
give
you
yes
and
no
answer.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
--
may
i
explain
it?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
may
i
explain
it?
the
--
the
union
commenced
to
throw
up
picket
lines
on
april
13th
and
they
came
up
one
right
after
the
other
every
few
days.
nine
picket
lines
were
up
by
april
28th
and
nine
bills
of
complaint
by
nine
separate
hotels
had
been
fired.
on
april
28th,
we
commenced
a
consolidated
hearing
for
the
granting
of
the
temporary
injunction.nine
hotels
involved,
four
trial
courts
involved.
judges
carroll,
floyd,
cannon
and
crawford,
each
one
had
either
one
or
two
of
those
cases.
they
sat
en
banc.
they
listened
to
all
the
testimony
in
all
nine
cases.
the
plaintiffs'
testimony
which
took
three
days
that
was
through
on
april
30th.
there
was
evidence
of
violence
in
some,
evidence
of
small
violence
and
others.
two
of
those
cases,
the
casablanca
and
the
sea
isle
were
heard
by
judge
kennedy.
he
withdrew
from
the
group
and
continued
his
hearings
by
himself
and
granted
injunctions
upon
the
ground
of
violence.
and
i'll
get
that
in
a
moment.
the
other
seven
continued
with
the
three
judges.
at
the
conclusion
of
our
testimony,
they
moved
that
the
injunctions
be
denied
and
they
denied
the
injunctions
upon
the
ground
that
they
did
not
think
sufficient
violence
had
been
shown
and
they
reserved
the
right
without
prejudice
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
picketing
was
illegal
and
unlawful
or
for
an
illegal
and
unlawful
practice.
to
that,
we
took
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
with
one
record
from
seven
cases.
and
in
part
of
the
record
in
two
cases
that
it
had
started
off.
am
i
--
am
i
making
myself
clear?
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said,
“we're
at
basis
because
there's
no
countervailing
evidence
shown
and
it's
obvious
to
us
that
the
picketing
has
been
thrown
up
without
any
opportunity
ever
having
been
afforded
these
people
to
even
negotiate
or
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
union
represented
any
of
their
employees.”
they
came
back
down
on
that
problem.
now,
it's
a
little
crazy,
i
thought.
when
it
came
down,
judge
carroll
immediately
entered
the
injunctive
order
in
compliance
with
the
supreme
court's
opinions,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
opinion.
judges
floyd
and
judges
gordon
had
returned
and
one
of
the
cases
had
been
assigned
to
judge
floyd
in
his
absence.
judge
gordon
and
judge
crawford
did
not
entered
the
injunctive
order
but
set
it
down
ahead
of
defendants'
testimony
even
though
the
supreme
court
had
determined
that
injunctive
order
should
be
granted,
temporary
injunctive
order
should
be
granted.
the
union
wired
to
the
supreme
court,
that's
the
wire
they're
talking
about,
asking
that
it
hold
up
its
order
until
such
time
as
they
could
put
their
evidence
in.
and
in
response
to
that,
the
supreme
court
wired
back,
we've
ordered
an
injunction,
enter
the
injunction.
now,
those
three
judges
who
had
denied
the
injunction
initially
immediately
commenced
hearings
on
june
4th.
now,
there
are
only
six
cases
involved,
two
of
which
are
here
now.
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
questions,
if
your
honor
please.
they
--
all
the
testimony
and
all
of
them
are
taken
at
one
time
before
these
judges.
these
three
judges
immediately
dissolve
the
injunctions
again
which
they
had
entered
in
the
--
in
response
to
the
supreme
court's
mandate
or
the
supreme
court's
order
after
they
heard
the
testimony.
now,
the
testimony
on
the
second
hearing
is
that
when
whether
union
comes
in
to
prove
it
represents
the
employees.
mind
you,
last
april,
many
of
the
employees
have
been
run
off.
and
the
hotels
to
protect
themselves
have
had
somebody
to
operate
their
hotels.
now,
we're
coming
to
june
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
weil,
it
was
--
i
--
it's
--
i
can
--
i
can
tell
you
in
a
moment,
your
honor.
that
testimony
commences
about
page
161,
i
believe,
that
hearing
opens.
now,
it's
earlier
than
that.
that
--
transcript
of
that
hearing
commences
on
saturday,
january
the
--
june
the
4th
at
page
109
of
the
record.
that's
the
second
consolidated
hearing
for
the
court.
now,
there,
the
union
attempts
to
establish
--
it
represented
employees
at
the
time
the
picket
lines
were
thrown
up.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
--
i
don't
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
put
it
exactly
that
way.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
--
i
say
that
the
opinion
was
reached.
judge
carroll,
the
next
day,
entered
his
injunctive
order.
judges
floyd,
gordon
and
crawford
didn't
act
into
those.
they
immediately
said
it
--
for
taking
of
testimony.
and
we
were
insisting
upon
them
complying
with
the
supreme
court's
order.
and
then,
why
it
was
sent
by
the
union?
we
are
about
to
take
our
testimony,
will
you
withhold
the
effect
of
your
order
until
we
can
do
so?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no,
the
supreme
court
--
no,
the
supreme
court
said,
“enter
the
injunctive
orders,”
and
they
were
entered.
then,
they
continued
the
taking
of
testimony
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
would
dissolve
the
injunction.
and
they
dissolve
them
after
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
still
a
temporary
injunction,
yes.
now,
it
attack
that
hearing
that
the
union
attempts
to
establish
its
representation
of
the
employees
at
the
time
it
put
up
picket
line.
it
brings
in
and
they
have
said
that
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
establish
that.
they
brought
in
a
form
of
a
written
card
they
had
been
using
for
years,
which
their
--
the
employees
signs
and
in
which
he
designates
the
union
as
a
bargaining
agent.
but
those
cards
that
brought
in
and
that
were
put
in
evidence
established
in
many
of
the
cases
that
only
represented
one
or
two
or
three
of
the
employees
at
the
time
that
they
threw
up
the
picket
line
when
those
hotels
would
have
200
and
300
employees.
now,
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
referring
to
when
it
says
from
the
designation
cards
which
were
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
but
which
are
not
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
it
is
clear
that
they
did
not
represent
the
employees.
that's
put
upon
me.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
[laughs]
your
honor,
if
they
had
represented
the
employees
at
that
time,
i
doubt
if
i
would
have
been
here
because
i
think
picket
lines
will
still
be
up.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
all
the
unions
of
the
hotel
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
oh,
they
would
have
signed.
now,
if
your
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
right.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
oh,
i
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no,
no.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i'm
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i'm
sorry.
i
did
not
understand,
chief
justice,
your
question.
there
is
--
record
will
disclose
on
what's
--
it
does
not
disclose
one
conference
at
which
court
reporters
were
present,
but
it's
referred
to
at
page
1166,
i
think,
of
the
record,
in
which
the
sea
isle
hotel
wish
to
negotiate.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
sea
isle.
it
--
that's
the
one
where
the
injunction
was
on
the
grounds
of
--
of
violence.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that's
not
here,
but
it's
--
a
part
of
the
record
is
here
because
it
will
--
one
of
the
consolidated
hearings
and
goes
all
the
record
came
up
in
the
consolidated
hearings
because
there
was
no
division
between
one
hotel
and
the
other
as
the
testimony
came
on.
and
in
the
versailles
case,
and
what
pages
i
am
trying
to
see
for
the
court
to
follow
me,
conferences
were
held
in
which
the
union
representative
and
one
of
the
attorneys
present
here
was
present,
i
was
present,
in
which
the
hotel
indicated
it
wouldn't
negotiate
if
they
represented
a
majority.
and
we
agreed.
i
thought
on
a
formula
for
the
union
to
demonstrate
it
--
who
it
represented.
and
the
conference
wound
up
whether
that
--
what
i
thought
was
an
agreement
that
the
gentleman
who
represent
the
union
who
is
present
here
today
and
my
law
partner
would
go
into
some
room
and
they
would
permit
the
employees
to
come
in
secretly
and
tell
them,
whether
they
want
the
union
to
represent
them
or
not.
now,
that
conference
broke
up
with
an
understanding
that
the
following
monday,
it
would
be
implemented
or
continued
for
the
final
waking
up
of
details.
and
that's
on
page
354
of
the
record.
that's
the
entire
conference.
but
there's
another
one
exactly
like
it.
these
hotels
had
never
refused
to
negotiate,
and
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
placed
and
came
out
with.
and
this
transcript
of
what
transpired
showed
that
i
took
the
position,
“if
you
--
the
counsel
under
the
person
representing
the
hotel
took
the
position
that
“if
you
represent
a
majority,
we
will
negotiate.”
and
the
union
says,
“suppose
we
don't
represent
a
majority,
will
you
negotiate?”
and
i
said,
“if
you
don't
represent
a
majority
and
i
don't
negotiate,
will
you
just
take
down
the
picket
line?”
and
no
agreement
from
them
on
that
could
be
reached
and
i
beg
that
that
conference
be
read
and
i
wish
that
other
one
would
have
to.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
i
will
do
my
best.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
sir?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
confused
you.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
if
your
honor
pleases.
if
i
may
say
so,
the
labor
law
in
florida
developed
and
was
elucidated
through
litigation.
this
had
not
--
this
court
had
not
faced
this
type
of
assault
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
supreme
court
of
florida.
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
--
that's
what
i'm
talking.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
what
i'm
talking
about.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
not
faced
a
mass
of
labor
litigation
under
its
labor
statute
until
this
hearing.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
the
statute,
i
shall
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
statute,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
found
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
the
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
full
statute.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
statute
gives
to
the
employee
the
right
to
self-organization
and
to
bargain
through
a
bargaining
agent
of
its
own
or
their
own
choice.
that's
what
the
statute
affords
them
without
--
and
makes
it
unlawful
for
anyone
to
intimidate
or
coerce
employee
to
deny
him
that
right.
that's
what
law
of
florida
was
at
the
time.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
without
particularization,
without
details.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that
question
has
not,
your
honor,
been
specifically
answered
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
we
have
taken
the
position,
and
i
think
correctly
so
that
collective
bargaining
means
a
bargaining
agent
for
a
unit
and
it
requires
a
majority.
but
it
is
not
in
the
statute
and
i
cannot
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
they
could
only
bargain
for
themselves,
your
honor,
because
they
have
the
right
to
a
statute
and
that
--
and
that
i
think
keeps
the
avenue
of
employment
open
both
to
union
and
non-union.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
so
understood
the
fontainebleau
case
to
mean,
and
that
is
my
interpretation
of
it,
to
me
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no.
it
did
not,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
on
the
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
on
--
on
the
basis
--
the
original
position,
your
honor,
was
on
the
basis
that
the
union
did
not
represent
the
employees
that
had
not
demonstrated
to
the
employees
that
represented
the
employees
that
had
suddenly
without
any
fair
place
for
picket
lines.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
not
laid
down
a
rule
in
reference
to
other
--
in
order
to
require
the
majority
at
the
time
that
picketing
commenced.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
laid
down
a
rule
that
this
--
this
union
had
moved
in
representing
no
one.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that's
right.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that
was
--
that
was
the
proof
at
the
moment
that
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
your
honor
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
your
--
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
if
your
honor
pleases,
at
the
fontainebleau
case,
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
laid
its
opinion
for
the
injunction
on
two
things.
one,
there
is
violence
and
two,
that
the
union
did
not
represent
the
--
a
majority
of
the
employees
or
a
substantial
number.
that's
what
i
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
think
i
can
do
that,
if
your
honor
pleases,
if
i
will
have
the
time.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i'm
here,
if
your
honor
pleases.
i'm
in
the
situation
where
this
--
the
states,
this
state
has
determined
that
this
union
moved
in
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
employees
to
designate
it
as
their
bargaining
agent
where
the
policy
of
the
state
says
they
have
no
power
to
do
that
by
picketing.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
[laughs]
that's
difficult
to
know
what
that
term
--
what
legal
meaning
that
term
has.
but
as
i
understand
it,
where
you're
driven
off
and
where
you're
afraid
to
--
to
cross
a
picket
line
and
where
your
employees
have
to
live
upstairs
in
your
luxury
hotel
in
order
to
wait
on
the
customers,
that
has
some
evidence
of
coercion.
now,
my
time
is
--
i
want
to
have
a
moment
or
two
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
all
i
can
say,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
that
the
record
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida
saw
or
established
the
fact
by
the
designation
cards
put
in
evidence
by
the
union
itself
which
have
not
been
brought
here
and
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
points
to
as
the
basis
for
its
conclusion.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no,
sir.
it
did
not
make
such
a
finding.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
base
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
base
it
on
this.
we
are
talking
about
different
injunctions
at
different
times.
did
--
i
never
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
at
the
time
that
the
supreme
court
ordered
the
injunctive
orders
originally,
the
sworn
complaint
and
the
evidence
taken
upon
which
an
injunctive
order
maybe
granted
established
that
the
union
represented
no
one.
they
put
in
no
evidence
in
at
that
time
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
and
put
no
answer
in
it
at
that
time.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
all
the
chancellors
--
the
chancellor
found
that
they
represented
less
than
a
majority
and
the
supreme
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
court
found
they
represented
insignificant
number.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
--
i'm
afraid
your
honor's
statement
is
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
absolutely
correct.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
can
only
call
your
honors'
attention
in
view
of
the
fact
the
evidence
is
not
here.
and
it
was
not
our
job
to
--
to
demonstrate
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
findings
of
fact
are
not
supported.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
think
we
demonstrate
that
in
our
brief.
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
page
17
when
we
quote
from
our
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
we
point
out
a
number
of
places
this
union
claimed
to
represented
or
had
designation
cards
on
at
the
time
the
picket
line
grew
up.
and
that
was
based
on
the
record
that
has
not
been
brought
here.
but
that's
a
statement
they
put
in
the
record
here
and
i
referred
to.
that's
all
i
can
refer
to.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
all
right.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
those
cards
indicated
the
algiers
hotel,
who
has
not
here,
one
employee
had
designated
the
union
as
its
bargaining
agent
prior
to
the
picket
line.
in
the
sans
souci
hotel
case,
two
employees
that
this
case
that
had
300
employees,
two
employees
that
visited
the
union
prior
to
the
picket
line.
the
monte
carlo
case,
not
here,
none
of
the
employees
had
designated
the
union
prior
to
the
picket
line.
and
the
sorrento
hotel
case,
not
here,
three
of
the
employees
had
designated
the
union
prior
to
the
picket
line
and
the
sherry
frontenac
hotel,
which
is
here,
one
employee
had
designated
the
union
prior
to
the
picket
line.
and
the
roney
plaza
hotel
case,
no
employee
had
designated
the
union
prior
to
the
picket
line.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
only
the
finding
that
i
referred
to
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
it
--
an
insignificant
number.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that's
after
the
injunction
was
vacated.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that's
right.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
has
so
said.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that's
so
said.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
has
so
said
in
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
all
right,
sir.
i
didn't
think,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
it
was
our
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
all
right,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
your
honor
has
given
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
five
minutes
additional,
may
i
take
it
at
this
time?
i
have
my
lights
up
and
my
time
is
up,
and
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
have
an
associate
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
all
right,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
all
right,
sir.
i
--
i
would
like
to
touch
the
legal
phase
of
the
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
--
problem,
if
i
may.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
now,
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
(inaudible)
case
has
determined
the
first
problem
here
involved
of
whether
or
not
a
court
may
enjoin
picketing
when
it's
for
an
unlawful
purpose
even
though
the
picketing
is
assumed
to
be
peaceful.
i'm
not
going
to
spend
any
time
on
that.
counsel
recognized,
i
think
it
does
govern
the
case.
but
they
expressed
the
hope
in
prayer
that
in
some
case
in
which
there's
been
a
certiorari
granted,
there
will
be
a
--
a
retreat
from
that
position
or
a
change
of
that
position.
i
must
take
a
moment
to
get
to
the
guss
and
the
fairlawn
and
the
san
diego
cases
in
which
it
is
contended
now
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempted
the
trial
court
from
rendering
an
--
an
injunction
and
preempted
the
field
or
took
from
the
trial
court
its
jurisdiction
to
act.
those
cases,
i
think,
are
involved
here.
and
those
cases
present,
really,
the
only
substantial
question
as
i
understand
it
in
the
--
as
i
see
it
in
the
record.
now,
this
presents
an
unusual
problem
because
the
trial
court
that
heard
this
case,
the
circuit
court,
is
a
court
of
general
chancery
jurisdiction.
and
it
has
the
ancient
jurisdiction,
the
traditional
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
anyone,
union
or
otherwise
that
interfere
unlawfully
with
another's
business
and
--
and
causes
irreparable
injury.
the
problem
here
presented
is
when
and
how
that
traditional
and
historic
chancery
jurisdiction
of
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
is
preempted
and
ousted.
in
the
guss
case,
there
was
an
admission
that
the
--
the
employer
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think,
in
that
case,
the
utah
board
was
actually
enforcing
rights
under
the
labor
act,
national
labor
act.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
they're
not
inference.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
they
are
not,
your
honor.
now,
that
presents
the
first
problem.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
page
53,
your
honor?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
final
decree
on
(inaudible)
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
i
--
i
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
the
problem
i
was
moving
to
when
the
(inaudible)
now,
the
problem
here
is
when
and
how
is
the
traditional
chancery
jurisdiction
of
this
trial
court
ousted?
when
must
the
question
be
raised?
how
must
it
be
raised?
may
it
be
waived?
now,
that's
a
field
in
which
there
has
been
nothing
said
as
far
as
i
can
find
as
to
the
method
and
manner
of
raising
the
problem.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
if
it's
a
matter
of
state
procedure,
then,
your
honor,
made
in
court.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
if
your
honor
will
permit
me,
i
will
get
to
that.
just
give
me
(inaudible)
please.
i
don't
mean
to
be
(inaudible)
but
my
time
is
(inaudible)
now,
the
union
in
each
case
filed
an
answer
not
raising
this
question
but
seeking
affirmative
relief
under
the
right
to
wake
statute
of
our
state
and
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
that
answer
was
filed
on
may
9th
in
most
of
these
cases.
the
complaints
were
filed
in
april.
they
were
winning.
and
this
union
has
a
record,
and
we
pointed
to
it,
of
resisting
it
all
the
time
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
ever
had
jurisdiction
of
the
hotel
industry.
they
have
taken
that
position
before
the
board.
and
we
cite
the
case
where
this
particular
union
took
that
position.
then,
they
did
not
take
the
position
in
the
state
court.
as
long
as
they
were
winning,
as
long
as
the
injunctions
were
being
denied,
and
they
were
winning
and
continuing
to
win,
remember,
if
your
honors
please,
we
took
all
the
appeals
but
the
lesser.
we
took
the
place
6,
8,
10.
they
were
happy
with
the
jurisdiction.
they
saw
nothing
in
it
to
justify
any
contention
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
anything
to
do
with
this,
nothing
in
the
pleadings
for
the
first
60
days
of
this
litigation
ever
suggested
that
we
were
in
commerce
or
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
any
jurisdiction.
in
the
cases
before
judge
floyd,
judge
crawford,
judge
gordon,
they
never
even
filed
this
answer,
this
supplemental
answer
which
was
filed
out
of
turn
raising
this
question
until
after
the
cases
were
on
appeal
at
the
final
hearing.
we
stipulated
that
they
had
misfiled
them.
and
they
could
assume
that
they
were
filed
as
of
june
28th.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no,
sir,
it
would
not.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no,
it
would
not
make
them
timely.
they
have
no
right
to
file
without
leave
of
court
for
20
days
after
the
case
becomes
an
issue.
i
say
true,
this
was
much
after
that
and
was
filed
without
leave
of
court.
now,
in
the
fairlawn
case,
the
--
the
chief
justice
has
clearly
pointed
out,
has
clearly
pointed
out
that
throughout
that
litigation
in
the
state
court,
there
was
always
the
question
raised
and
urged
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
national
--
preempted
the
court.
justice
pointed
out.
and
it
was
not
pointed
out,
i
assume.
and
i
--
it
was
pointed
out
because
this
court
in
its
inception
had
jurisdiction
of
this
litigation
at
this
class
of
cases,
but
something
must
be
done
and
must
be
done
timely.
and
in
other
cases,
this
court
had
said
there
had
been
no
suggestion
when
this
question
was
raised
that
is
frivolous
or
that
is
dilatory.
now,
i
ask,
i
ask,
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
who
perceives
in
a
case
--
in
a
class
of
cases
that
has
jurisdiction
made
the
union
come
in
and
