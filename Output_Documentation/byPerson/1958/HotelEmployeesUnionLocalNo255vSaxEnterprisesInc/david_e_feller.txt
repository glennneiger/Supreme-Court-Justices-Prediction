mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
four
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
rebuttal
and
succinctly,
if
i
may.
one,
dealing
with
the
fact
that
the
commerce
question
was
properly
raised
on
the
record
here
and
is
properly
before
the
court,
the
question
of
preemption,
the
second
point,
i'll
go
back
to
each
of
these,
is
that
the
records
are
complete.
the
records
are
complete
here.
and
dealing
with
that,
i
would
like
to
state
to
the
court
what
i
understand
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
on
a
fair
reading
of
its
opinions,
established
as
the
rule
governing
picketing
in
florida.
mr.
david
e.
feller
they
are
--
the
only
thing
that
is
absent
are
physical
exhibits,
individual
signed
application
cards,
designation
cards,
designating
the
union,
all
the
evidence
at
that
time
they
came
in
is
here,
the
complete
transcripts
of
testimony
in
everyone
of
the
cases
is
here.
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
or
the
next
to
the
last
point
is
this
question
as
to
whether
the
advertising
involves
because
there
was
no
strike,
because
the
question
which
mr.
sibley
raised,
the
last
question
is
the
question
of
violence
which
your
honors
have
been
discussing.
now
coming
back
to
the
first,
on
the
commerce
question,
on
the
question
of
preemption,
this
issue
was
raised
by
supplemental
answer
before
final
hearing
in
every
case.
there
may
--
no
misunderstanding
about
that.
now,
in
four
cases,
in
fact,
it
did
not
--
was
not
found
in
the
record
when
they
made
it
up
for
appeal
after
the
final
decree
and
the
counsel
entered
into
stipulation
that
it
had
been
misfiled.
the
courts
in
every
one
of
the
case,
including
the
san
marino
in
its
ultimate
resolution,
found
that
the
material
which
the
party
stipulated
could
be
considered
as
a
proper
testimony,
was
immaterial
and
irrelevant.
and
finally,
at
no
point
until
their
brief
was
filed
here,
was
it
ever
suggested
that
this
question
was
not
been
properly
raised.
the
question
was
(inaudible)
on
the
merits
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
and
i
refer
to
you
to
the
record
in
which
we
--
because
we
anticipated
that
some
sort
of
question
might
be
raised,
we
asked
to
have
to
put
in
the
record,
the
briefs,
which
were
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
because
the
supreme
court
of
florida
didn't
pass
it.
and
your
honors
will
look
at
our
record
that's
page
77
to
78,
which
is
the
brief
covering
17
of
the
cases,
at
pages
1040
to
1043,
the
respondents
here
argued
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
of
course,
this
argument
was
made
before
the
guss
case.
now,
the
guss
case
has
been
decided.
they
decide
that
they're
not
very
good
on
the
merits,
so
they
better
go
back
and
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
supplemental
answer
wasn't
filed
within
20
days
in
the
trial
court,
even
though
they
stipulated
that
a
witness
would
testify
in
support
of
the
defense
alleged
in
the
supplemental
answer
and
without
objection.
for
the
reasons
which
we
indicated
in
our
reply
brief,
it's
clear
they
can't
raise
that
kind
of
procedural
irregularity
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
now,
in
the
--
let's
say
that
the
counsel
said
that
this
question
wasn't
ever
before
the
court.
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
at
page
381,
you
will
find
they
reside
in
the
fact
that
this
question
had
been
raised
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
would
think
it
would
depend
upon
--
i
would
have
to
read
florida
law
to
find
out
whether
this
was
a
bona
fide
decision
under
your
--
your
honors
decision
in
the
n.a.a.c.p.
case
from
the
state
of
alabama
last
year
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
if
it
had
in
fact,
was
the
law,
that
if
you
filed
an
answer
or
supplemented
a
pleading
on
the
21st
or
22nd
day
and
did
not
get
as
the
rule
which
is
identical
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
provides,
written
consent
of
counsel
or
leave
of
court,
that
then,
nothing
that
was
done
thereafter,
could
be
possibly
raised
as
error
even
though
the
parties
met
the
issue
at
the
trial,
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
was
the
law
and
it
was
in
fact
the
law
of
florida,
i
suppose
that
would
be
an
adequate
state
ground.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that
florida,
if
it
had
such
a
rule
and
consistently
applied
it,
it
could
apply
such
rule.
i
see
no
evidence
in
any
of
the
opinions
here
that
this
--
that
such
and
such
a
--
a
proposition
was
ever
relied
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
or
by
counsel
on
the
other
side
who
argued
the
question
on
the
merit.
mr.
david
e.
feller
all
right.
the
next
point
--
and
let
me
get
this
because
there's
been
some
complaint
that
the
record
is
not
complete
here
and
this
whole
question
of
substantial
number.
and
i
--
i
want
to
try
to
express
to
the
court
what
i
understand
the
supreme
court
of
florida
who
had
held
in
these
cases
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
is
that
it
did
hold.
in
the
first
case,
in
the
saxony
case,
it
said,
"you
cannot
picket
unless
you
give
the
employer
an
opportunity
to
negotiate."
that
was
a
new
rule.
and
you
have
to
represent
some
of
the
employees.
then,
they
went
on
to
a
hearing
after,
and
the
union
moved
to
vacate
the
injunctions
which
had
been
granted
on
some
such
theory
and
proved
that
in
fact
they
did
represent
a
substantial
number
of
these
people
and
they
had
given
the
employer
opportunity
to
negotiate.
in
what
is
called
the
second
boca
raton
case
and
the
testimony
is
here.
now,
i
have
simply
referred
because
of
time.
in
the
saxony
--
in
the
sherry
frontenac,
and
he
says
we
had
only
two
people,
40
people
came
in
the
court
and
said,
"we
want
the
union
to
represent
us.
we
walked
off
our
jobs
as
part
of
a
strike
called
by
the
union.
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
no
violence,
no
coercion."
he
says
only
two
people.
why?
because
every
time
a
man
so
testified,
counsel
of
the
other
side
said,
"did
he
sign
a
card?"
he
said,
"yes."
but
the
card
is
the
best
evidence.
the
trial
court
sustained
this
best
evidence
rule.
they
put
the
card
to
it.
now,
the
cards
were
sometimes
signed
to
take
the
man
walked
up.
they
say,
"therefore,
he
had
not
designated
the
union
prior
to
the
time
of
the
picketing
began
because
the
card
has
that
date
on
it."
even
though
the
man
was
there,
his
testimony
was
not
controverted,
some
of
them
had
been
members
of
the
union
for
years
but
hasn't
signed
the
card
designated
to
the
union
as
its
representative
at
that
particular
hotel.
so
that's
the
whole
business
about
the
card.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
never
really
reached
that
issue,
because
in
the
second
case,
the
second
boca
raton
case,
they
said,
"you
can't
picket
even
if
you
show,"
--
and
the
exact
words
of
them,
“that
you
represent
an
insignificant
number
or
a
majority,
if
you
don't
tender
your
evidence
that
you
represent
them
before
you
begin
picketing.”
and
of
course,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
where
they
tendered
the
certified
statements
from
the
public
accountant
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
reversed
the
denial
of
an
injunction
on
the
basis
of
boca
raton.
what
that
means
is
that
you
have
to
give
them
the
names,
the
signed
cards.and
if
you
don't
do
that,
you
can't
picket
in
florida.
and
that's
the
essence
of
what
florida
held.
for
that
reason,
the
question
of
who
was
what
never
occurred
to
anybody,
and
we
didn't
bring
the
signed
--
the
exhibits,
the
cards,
that's
the
only
thing
that's
missing
here
into
the
court.
now,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
just
one
more
thing.
on
the
question
of
violence,
in
only
--
since
this
question
has
been
asked,
in
only
the
first
cases
before
the
first
saxony
opinion,
did
anybody
tried
to
prove
violence?
and
those
are
the
cases
in
which
all
of
which
that
are
here,
the
courts
found
no
violence.
after
that,
they
alleged
it,
in
some
cases,
they
didn't
put
on
a
witness
for
that
purpose.
and
of
course,
there
was
nothing
to
answer.
any
reading
of
the
fontainebleau
opinion
in
which
the
trial
court
incidentally
also
found
no
violence,
but
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
which
they
mentioned
everything
in
the
book
that
the
whole
all
of
these
injunctions,
12
were
sustained
on
the
ground
of
violence
advising
to
face
first
to
the
fontainebleau
opinion
and
their
own
briefs.
because
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
these
cases,
they
did
not
argue
even
in
the
casablanca
case,
which
there
had
been
violence,
they
didn't
even
argue
that
the
injunction
could
be
sustained
upon
any
violence
theory.
but
once
the
supreme
court
of
florida
came
out
with
this
(inaudible)
you
have
to
tender
the
cards
before
you
can
picket,
that's
all
i
have
to
show
and
that's
all
they
are
now.
thank
you.
