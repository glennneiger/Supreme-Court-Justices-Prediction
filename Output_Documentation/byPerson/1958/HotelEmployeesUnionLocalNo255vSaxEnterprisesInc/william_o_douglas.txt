justice
william
o.
douglas
did
the
--
did
the
labor
board,
the
national
board
refuse
to
act
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
this
--
in
this
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
are
you
reading
now?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
planning
to
save
any
time
for
the
question
of
the
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
the
read
the
record
--
would
you
mind
turning
to
record
page
53?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
that
first
paragraph,
an
affidavit
by
a
man
with
the
name
of
smith
has
been
tendered
on
these
issues

o.
douglas
53
of
the

justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
final
decree.
the
recital
in
that
is
that
that
affidavit
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
was
--
was
objected
to
on
the
ground
that
it
was
immaterial
and
irrelevant.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
court
sustained
the
objection
upon
that
ground.
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
why
is
it
immaterial
and
doesn't
that
present
a
question
of
law
for
us
under
the
guss
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
a
matter
of
state
procedure,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
would
be
a
matter
of
state
procedure.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
--
the
--
in
the
--
in
final
injunction,
the
court
passes
on
that
very
issue
here.
