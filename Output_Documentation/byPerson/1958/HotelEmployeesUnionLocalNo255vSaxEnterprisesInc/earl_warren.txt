go
ahead,
justice
harlan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
--
is
the
question
of
the
preemption
adequately
raised
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
in
no
hurry
about
but
i
was
going
to
say
this.
if
we
decided
--
if
it
is
adequately
raised
and
if
we
decided
with
you
on
that
issue,
would
it
be
necessary
for
us
to
go
into
these
other
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldberg,
some
of
the
justices
have
been
looking
for
--
for
that
language
and
they
don't
find
it
on
18
and
20.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
just
ask
if
these
two
cases,
the
saxony
and
the
sans
souci
were
tried
by
the
same
chancellor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldberg,
we've
taken
a
lot
of
your
time.
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
more
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
you
--
if
you
wish
it.and
of
course,
counsel,
we'll
give
you
an
hour
and
five
minutes
for
--
for
your
side.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sibley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
one
of
them
that's
on
appeal
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
like
to
have
you
explain
that
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they're
not
--those
cases
are
not
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
those
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
--
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
they
did
represent
them
at
that
time,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
mean
that
the
hotels
would
not
have
recognized
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
even
though
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
even
though
--
no,
may
i
ask,
if
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that,
if
they
had,
you
just
made
the
point
that
they
did
not
have
a
majority
of
the
employees.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
ask
you
if
they
had
had
a
majority
of
the
employees
at
the
time
they
put
up
the
picket
line,
would
the
company
have
recognized
them,
your
answer
to
me
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
the
pickets
would
still
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
be
there.
now,
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
mean
by
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
they
would
not
recognize
them
or
if
you
didn't,
would
the
company
have
recognized
the
majority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
not
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
before
you
get
to
the
decision,
may
i
just
ask
you
if
those
--
anything
in
the
law
which
required
the
employees
to
have
a
majority
of
this
--
of
them
and
if
they
did
--
didn't
have
a
majority,
would
they
still
organize
and
represent
those
who
did
belong
to
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
i
--
i
assume
that
they
did
have
a
majority,
could
they
bargain,
under
this
florida
law,
for
all
of
the
employees
of
the
hotel
or
could
they
only
bargain
for
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
--
now
i
interrupted
your
answer
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
justice
frankfurter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
just
like
to
ask
one
more
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that
is
whether
there
is
any
finding
by
any
court
in
any
of
these
cases
that
are
before
us
that
the
union
put
a
picket
line
without
any
--
representing
any
employees
in
that
institution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
they
--
did
the
supreme
court,
in
words,
find
that
at
the
time
these
people
put
up
a
picket
line
on
any
of
these
institutions
that
it
did
not
have
any
members?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
then
what
are
we
arguing
about
here
when
you
--
when
you
say
that
these
people
put
up
a
picket
line
without
any
--
representing
any
employees?
where
do
we
base
it
upon
if
we
don't
base
it
upon
--
where
do
you
base
this
on
upon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
this
isn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
finding
of
any
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
asked
you
about
anyone
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
give
me
anyone.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
you
had
a
hearing
after
that
and
the
chancellor
filed
that
those
things
were
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
less
than
a
majority
is
more
than
nothing,
isn't
it?
and
you
have
been
talking
about
nothing.
you
have
been
--
i
feel
--
feel
that
[laughs]
--
that
the
way
as
i
read
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
base
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
mean
--
i
mean
you've
been
saying
if
they
had
no
--
they
had
no
--
no
employees
at
all
that
they
represented.
now,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
where
--
what
you
rely
on
to
represent
to
us
that
at
the
time
they
put
up
these
picket
lines,
they
represented
no
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
you
say
there
that
they
represented
no
one
at
the
time
these
pickets
were
put
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
read
it
to
us
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that
is
your
statement.
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
was
there
any
finding
to
that
effect
by
any
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no.
you
have
--
you
have
much
time
left
to
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
well,
your
division
of
time.
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
make
as
you
wish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
these
hotels
in
commerce?
so
do
you
contend
these
are
not
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
53.
that's
the
final
decree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
final
decree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
and
that
would
be
timely,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
no,
your
stipulation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
--
it
would
not
make
them
timely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
counsel
said
there
was
a
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
there
was
no
violence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
was
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
isn't
very
consistent
with
what
you
just
--
you
just
answered,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
in
the
saxony
case.
you
were
talking
about
the
saxony
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
why
i
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
in
the
record
about
violence
in
the
saxony
case?
where
do
we
find
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
kind
of
violence
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
speaking
of
the
saxony
case
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
i
ask
you
about
the
saxony
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you've
been
talking
about
the
saxony
case
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
know
where
i
can
find
what
evidence
there
is
in
the
record
about
the
saxony
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
is
the
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
was
some
violence
in
the
fontainebleau
case.
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
there
was
none
in
all
the
rest
of
the
case.
is
it
your
position
that
the
violence
was
occurred
in
the
fontainebleau
case
places
the
position
of
the
union
in
each
of
every
one
of
those
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
--
was
it
the
finding
against
you
as
judge
brennan
brings
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
the
contrary,
didn't
they
find
that
there
was
none?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
great
difference,
between
the
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
--
what
difference
is
running
here
in
my
mind,
i
understand
that
it
was
not
alleged
in
all
of
these
cases
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
there'd
be
no
finding
in
those
cases
where
it
was
direct.
now,
may
i
ask
you,
in
how
many
of
the
cases
where
violence
was
alleged?
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
violence
and
then
how
many
did
it
failed
to
find
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
doesn't
answer
my
question
again.
let
me
ask
you.
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
in
--
in
every
case
where
violence
was
alleged,
did
the
trial
court
find
that
there
was
no
negligence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
what
case
--
what
cases
did
it
not
so
find?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alleged
--
you
say
not
found?
you
mean
they
found
that
there
was
no
violence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
furnish
to
the
court
either
you
or
counsel
by
what
you
have
written
sentence
of
the
briefs,
in
the
part
of
the
supreme
court
in
that
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
assume
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
--
your
time
is
up,
but
i'd
like
to
ask
you
just
one
question
on
that,
mr.
anderson.
if
--
if
the
statute
did
not
comply
with
any
machinery
for
holding
an
election,
and
if
the
employer
would
not
deal
with
these
people
unless
he
demonstrate
â€“
the
union
demonstrated
that
it
did
happen,
majority
or
a
substantial
number
of
--
of
employees,
what
kind
of
a
showing
could
the
union
make
to
the
employer
that
would
satisfy
either
to
the
statute
or
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
--
no,
just
--
just
an
abstract
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
hotel
people
would
have
fired
every
one
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
have
any
law
that
would
prevent
the
employer
from
firing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
could've
done
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
were
running
that
hazard,
at
least,
if
they
the
names
to
--
to
the
employer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
trying
to
find
more
alternative
when
they
won't
--
when
they
won't
consent
to
a
--
to
an
election,
under
the
--
under
the
court
decree
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
feller.
