mr.
goldberg,
i
don't
want
to
interfere
with
your
argument
but
are
you
going
to
leave
yourself
time
to
argue
the
preemption
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
assuming
that
your
improper
proof,
which
was
rejected
now
in
this
preemption
issue
by
the
state
courts,
is
accepted
as
prima
facie
sufficient,
would
that
mean
that
we
could
decide
the
present
--
preemption
issue
up
here
or
it
have
to
go
back
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
the
state
--
why
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
mean
the
--
the
facts
tendered
in
the
proper
were
not
--
were
not
contested
or
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
controverted?
