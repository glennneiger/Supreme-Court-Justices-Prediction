mr.
goldberg,
before
you
get
to
the
hearing,
do
you
concede,
setting
aside
the
question
of
preemption,
do
you
concede
that
this
complaint
alleged
a
cause
of
action
on
the
florida
law?

justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
anderson,
i'm
looking
at
page
17
of
the
record.
i
understand
that
is
the
part
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion
in
the
saxony
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
page
17,
the
supreme
court
says
to
justice
hobson,
“we
have
examined
the
record
carefully
and
we
find
insufficient
showing
to
reverse
the
chancellor
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
picketing
the
saxony
hotel
was
accompanied
by
violence.”
now,
that
i
understand
you
to
say
that
notwithstanding
this
affirmance
of
the
trial
judge
that
there
was
no
violence
in
the
saxony
case.
nevertheless,
something
that
was
said
in
the
fontainebleau
opinion
in
effect,
what?
overrules,
versus
or
somehow
reaches
the
contrary
conclusion
as
to
the
saxony
hotel?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
means
then,
of
course,
as
to
the
saxony
hotel.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
that
in
fontainebleau
opinion?
do
we
have
that?
justice
potter
stewart
will
you
point
that
out?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
is
it
that
in
relation
to
the
fontainebleau?
