justice

what
if
they're
moot?
they
can
be
vacated
without
being
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
the
question
is
whether
the
board
should
have
taken
jurisdiction
or
could
have
taken
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
think
it's
relevant
but
does
dispose
in
the
sentence
our
prior
decisions
if
the
board
could
have
and
the
state
has
preempted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
making
the
point,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
guss
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
suggest
that
this
court
holds
that
the
court
below
had
no
jurisdiction.
they
don't
have
to
decide
what
was
right
in
the
manner
in
which
it
should
exercise
it
on
the
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
if
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
you
don't
examine
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
in
--
where
it
exercise
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

it
has
no
jurisdiction,
you
don't
go
into
the
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know,
but
i
--
did
i
misunderstand
you
in
--
did
i
misunderstand
in
having
you
say
that
you
don't
want
to
argue
that
because,
mr.
braham
will
argue
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
essential,
at
least
to
my
point
of
view.
it's
a
threshold
question
in
your
case,
and
you
will
argue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
question
of
preemption
turned
on
whether
or
not
these
hotels
were
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
might
be
an
order
to
give
this
board
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
whether
--
whether
that
question,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
record,
though
i
read
your
brief.
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
is
the
question
of
whether
these
are
amenable
from
your
point
of
view
to
the
board
potentially
amenable
at
all
events
whether
that
question
was
contested?
and
is
--
is
that
question
to
be
determined
by
us
on
the
basis
of
materials
appearing
in
the
record
either
by
way
of
proof
or
concession
or
determination
by
the
board
itself?
what
is
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
real
--
that
the
legal
issue
on
that
point
is
whether
your
offer
of
proof,
prima
facie
at
least,
went
to
the
establishment
of
these
hotels
in
interstate
commerce
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
amenable
to
the
board's
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
exercised
or
not,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
you
are
arguing
then
that
if
your
offer
of
proof
is
adequate
to
maintain
the
proposition
towards
which
the
proof
was
directed,
that,
if
found
to
be
so,
undermines
the
starting
point
of
the
court
below.
justice
felix

all
right.

justice

what
--

what's

that's
all
but
in
19
to

you
said
(inaudible)
justice
felix

well,
this
is
the
allegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
before
you
move
on,
did
i
--
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you've
said
that
that
paragraph,
the
first
of
the
paragraph
on
18,
is,
so
to
speak,
you
made
law
by
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
the
supreme
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
part
of
its
common
law
determination,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
because
of
changes
but
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
what
they
substantively
laid
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
forgive
me
for
going
back
to
the
criteria
or
whatever
they
call
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
paragraph,
“the
court
professes
the

cases,”
which
--
which
i
know
nothing,

but
the

seems
to
be
a

where
they
--
you
say
that
they
were
unjustified
in
citing

do
you
spell
that?

it

what
does
it

don't

may
be

justice

the

couldn't
do
more
than
enjoined

--
justice

--
nothing
to
do
with
it.

what
is
the
number
of
employees

justice

i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
can't
take
that
out
of
the
context.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

take
it
and
read
it,
but
you
can't
then,
after
having
read
it,
say
that
the
law
of
florida
is
if
you
picket
in
a
“damned

i
don't

spirit,
that's
illegal
and
that's
part
of
collocation
of
--
justice

--
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
your
argument
is
that
the
law
was
laid
down
in
occasions
within
cruel
and
violence.
the
specific
cases
before
this
court
are
devoid
of
violence
or
even
have
an
affirmative
denial
of
violence.
and
you
argue
that
the
law
laid
down
in
that
case
is
not
measure
of
what
was
to
be
the
law
in
these
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goldberg,
may
i
ask?
how
many
injunctions
against
which
you
complain
are
before
us?
and
would
you
mind
stating
where
they
are,
the
exact
terms
of
the
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
the
really
specific
problem
before
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
they
return
to
that
injunction
can
stand
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
light
of
this
record,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
changed
when
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
would
you
forgive
me
if
i
interrupt
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
used
three
words,
two
words
in
a
phrase,
untruthful
and
violent
when
you
--
you
spoke
of
false
advertising.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right?
now,
the
inference
you
left
on
my
mind,
and
i
take
it
was
left
to
be
then
was
that
this
injunction,
the
constitutional
validity
of
which
is
challenged
or
will
base
on
determination
either
to
conclusions
from
evidence,
human
or
by
affidavit
or
through
findings
of
stipulations
that
there
were
untruthful
utterances,
violence
and
false
advertising.
if
that
be
so,
it
ought
not
to
be
too
difficult
to
turn
to
the
records
and
point
out
where
there
was
such
finding
where
there
was
such
evidence.
am
i
asking
too
much?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
was
admitted
that
there
was
advertising
not
that
it
was
false.that's
how
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
i
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
sibley.
my
point
is
that
if
the
thing
turns
on
falsity
and
violence,
it's
one
thing
and
easy
of
demonstration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean,
they
didn't
bring
up
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
facts
--
were
the
facts
in
the
cases
that
are
here
which
were
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
an
--
a
case
that
isn't
here.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
that
the
facts
of
the
cases
that
are
here
were
the
cases
of
the
--
that
was
--
that
would
be
brought
to
the
supreme
court
on
which
it
--
it
wrote
the
opinion
which
guided
the
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
the
cases
which
are
before
this
court
--
are
the
--
are
the
records,
the
records,
and
the
basis
of
which
the
injunctions
were
issued
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
eventually,
are
the
records
in
those
cases
here,
those
that
we
independently
can
decide
on
the
basis
of
those
records
what
legal
conclusions
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
i'll
appreciate
that
some
questions
can't
be
answered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
you,
the
supreme
court
directed
that
injunctions
be
entered
by
the
lower
court
and
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
three
of
the
judges
decline
or
refused
to
act
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
supreme
court
said
no
and
yet,
the
judges
went
ahead.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
still
a
temporary
injunction,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sibley
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
need
your
help.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
need
your
help
in
trying
--
and
i'm
trying
to
understand
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
there
are
certain
injunctions
before
us
which
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
being
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
of
florida
to
--
to
have
issued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
those
injunctions
are
sustained
by
your
supreme
court,
which
is
the
court
of
(inaudible)
to
decide
them
in
order
to
--
maybe
you'll
be
--
in
order
--
to
be
able
to
petition
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
injunctions
are
sustained
by
a
summary
per
curiam
opinion,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
we
must
look
somewhere
else
for
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court's
action
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
that
it
referred,
and
that's
the
fontainebleau
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
fontainebleau
case
is
the
--
is
the
justification
that
your
supreme
court
gives.
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
that
opinion
was
filed
as
i
know
february
1st,
1957.
will
you
be
good
enough
to
state
what
the
law
of
florida
either
statutory
or
common
law
decision?
what's
the
law
of
florida
was
as
to
the
legality
--
the
conditions
under
which
picketing
is
legal?
more
particularly,
in
relation
between
the
employees
giving
notice
or
representing
etcetera,
etcetera.
what
was
the
law
of
florida
which
determined
whether
picketing
was
legal
under
florida
law
either
by
your
statute
or
by
prior
decisions
which
governed
chief
justice
terrell's
opinion
in
the
fontainebleau
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
--
this
rehearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
those.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
florida
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
the
statute?
would
you
state
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
these
things
that
bounded
by
statute
so
far
as
florida
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state
the
requirement
of
that
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
far
as
relevant
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
particularization,
without
details.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
was
the
decision
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
the
statute
is
silent
on
the
question
of
a
majority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
your
supreme
court
silent
on
that
subject.
from
my
point
of
view,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
been
entitled
to
lay
down
rules
if
it
is
a
legislature
of
florida.
what
i
want
to
know
is
did
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
before
this
litigation
arose,
lay
down
any
rule
on
that
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
laid
down
a
rule
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
got
from
your
elucidation
up
to
now
was,
that's
quite
erroneously,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
indicated
and
laid
down
guides
for
the
lower
courts
of
florida
for
the
chancellors
that
there
must
be
a
majority
in
order
to
put
the
picketing,
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
it
that
it
told
--
why
didn't
it
tell
the
lower
courts
to
issue
injunctions?
on
what
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
violence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
represent
five
out
of
500
or
a
majority
out
of
500?
i'm
just
asking
for
something
that
ought
to
be
answerable
from
what
was
written
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court.
i'm
assuming
oral
argument
is
intended
to
enlighten
the
court
and
does
not
require
me
to
read
your
brief
in
order
to
understand
what
your
argument
is.
i
don't
mean
to
say
i
don't
need
them
read
eventually
but
i
do
not
want
to
read
briefs,
most
of
the
time,
before
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
entitled
to
have
the
case
made
clear
by
oral
arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
did
it
lay
down?
what
kind
of
a
rule
did
it
lay
down
to
guide
the
chancellors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
does
the
record
--
did
the
--
are
the
records
in
the
cases
that
are
before
us
bare
out
a
justification
of
the
injunction
on
that
basis
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
that
this
union
represented
no
employee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
the
public
policy.
i
don't
mean
i
don't
understand
it.
i
both
understand
it.
now,
i
think
it's
constitutionally
invalid
for
florida
to
have
such
a
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
i
can
tell
whether
it's
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
found
those
two
facts
with
reference
to
fontainebleau
doesn't
give
any
basis
for
me
to
find
that
those
facts
existed
with
reference
to
two
other
cases
and
it
so
happens
to
other
cases
that
are
along
before
this
court.
so
you
have
to
do
this,
if
i
may
say
so.
you
have
to
establish
that
this
record
comes
within
the
determinations
of
fontainebleau
even
on
violence
or
on
a
representation
to
(inaudible)
can
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
don't
do
that,
where
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
don't
do
that,
where
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
your
record
sustain
your
claim
that
there
was
coercion
in
any
sense
that
that
term
has
legal
meaning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
evidence
isn't
here,
i
must
interrupt
you,
if
the
evidence
isn't
here,
speaking
for
myself,
this
court
is
incompetent
to
set
aside
the
judgment
below,
but
is
it
true
that
the
evidence
isn't
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
after
the
proceedings
to
vacate
the
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
after
the
injunction
was
vacated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
and
i
can
assure
you
that
i
haven't
the
slightest
notion
what
i
think
about
this
case
at
this
point
because
my
mind
isn't
(inaudible)
based
on
goldberg
painted
one
nice
picture
and
you
painted
another
nice
picture.
but
it
ought
to
be
susceptible
of
some
specific
actions
to
what
seems
to
be
relevant
questions,
namely,
has
your
supreme
court
laid
down,
since
the
statute
hasn't,
that
picketing
presupposes,
the
right
of
picketing
presupposes
representation
by
the
union
of
a
majority
of
the
employees.
and
you
said
no
to
that,
isn't
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
next
question
is
has
your
supreme
court
said,
as
a
matter
of
law,
picketing
can
be
valid,
must
represent
--
must
be
represented
by
a
union
that
has
a
substantial,
whatever
that
may
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
and
therefore,
the
question
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
a
state
can
lay
down
the
requirements
of
substantiality
on
the
part
of
the
strike
and
picketing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
so
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that's
the
governing
florida
principle
and
the
question
is
whether
that's
valid
or
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
that
right?
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
next,
out
in
the
--
these
two
fat
volumes,
i
should
think
these
--
these
volumes
are
so
fat,
would
have
all
the
relevant
facts
in
them,
do
these
--
do
these
records
contain
the
basis
for
determining
whether,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
supreme
court
was
justified
in
saying
it
was
not
a
substantial
representation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
there
were
--
there
were
--
there
was
evidence,
there
were
affidavits,
there
were
legal
materials
in
these
proceedings
which
have
not
been
brought
up
before
us,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
these
two
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
your
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
foreclosed
by
the
court's
findings
that
there
wasn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
that
statement
is
irreversible
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
finding
of
trial
court?
is
that
what
you're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
they
all
argued
before
your
supreme
court
to
save
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
argued
one
after
another
(inaudible)
save
conflicts.
all
the
records
must
before
them
in
addition
to
collective
opinion
being
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
there
anything
--
were
there
any
irregularity
or
further
evidence
of
any
kind,
hearing
the
word,
evidence
broadly
in
the
saxony
case
after
the
statements
to
which
mr.
justice
brennan
called
your
attention.
that
opinion
was
may
27,
1955.
the
case
can
go
back
for
further
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
understand
how
a
pattern
may
--
may
reveal
itself
in
the
last
item
of
the
theory,
i
don't
quite
follow
as
the
pattern
would
jump
back
to
categorize
the
person's
confusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
the
opinion
in
fontainebleau
under
that
--
in
1957,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying,
in
effect,
is
that
we
should
read
the
fontainebleau
opinion
in
1957
as
though
the
supreme
court
says
here,
in
view
of
the
protested
cases
that
come
before
us,
we
have
now
reconsidered
what
we
said
in
the
--
in
such
enterprises
and
now
find
with
the
enumeration
that
we've
had,
that
what
displays
there,
was
in
fact
in
an
environment
of
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
injunctions
were
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
out
of
these
12
and
how
many
did
the
trial
court
find
affirmatively,
the
negative
facts
that
there
was
no
violence
and
how
many
did
he
find
there
was
violence
and
how
many
were
there
no
finding,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
many
was
there
--
a
finding
--
but
no
finding
in
one
way
or
the
other,
or
were
the
findings
of
no
violence
are
the
(inaudible)
violence
throughout
in
all
the
12
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
ask
you
this?
does
your
brief
enumerate
the
--
the
particularity
which
you
had
done
--
which
you
particularize
the
last
few
minutes,
the
record
reference
of
violence
in
each
particular
case,
and
if
not,
the
chief
justice
agree,
i
take
it,
would
help
at
all?
you
filed
a
memorandum
of
no
particular
violence,
namely,
that
in
each
case,
you
will
now
(inaudible)
record
page
180.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
kind
of
specifications,
past
and
present,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
you
to
say
it's
in
the
brief,
i
could
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
surely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
understood
you're
right,
have
i
not,
that
you
say
that
all
cases
are
governed
by
the
fontainebleau
case
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
brief
filed
by
you
and
by
the
union
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
the
fontainebleau
--
on
the
fontainebleau
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
these
(inaudible)
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
brief
of
both
sides
before
your
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
briefs
that
lead
to
or
rather
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
fontainebleau
decision
and
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
question
before
you
sit
down,
you
said
that
--
that
some
of
the
12
injunctions
in
order
that
these
12
instance,
there
was
no
claim
filed.
therefore,
the
injunction
couldn't
rest
on
one,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
on
what
basis
--
when
do
justify
the
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
rates
of
its
entire
--
they
maybe
complete
from
your
point
of
view,
are
they
entire?s
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
feller,
suppose
the
florida
supreme
court
has
had
in
turn
which
should
has
not
voted
as
to
the
in
turn
for
such
an
objection
of
preemption
must
be
raised
out
of
the
litigation.
could
that
be
an
alarmed
position
for
the
state
court
to
take?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not.
but
that
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
was
the
rule.
as
i
frequently
was
informed,
to
my
surprise,
that
there
are
a
number
of
states
which
are
pretty
extensive
things,
you
conduct
your
litigation
on
one
case
you
--
you
can,
if
i
may
use
the
ancient
figure
of
speech,
what
was
in
the
meaning
of
the
litigation.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did.
i
do
say
their
figures
would
indicate
that,
by
saying
(inaudible)
cases
and
saying
in
every
case
that
initially
thought
to
be
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
that's
why
i
know
whether
you
agree
that
florida
could
it
be
trouble
to
say
it
was
raised
such
an
objection
ab
initio
and
not
asking
its
face
that
15
on
the
ground
that
you've
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
each
of
you
takes
the
position
that
it's
to
your
advantage
to
take
up
the
time.
why
don't
you
go
on
to
the
next
point?
