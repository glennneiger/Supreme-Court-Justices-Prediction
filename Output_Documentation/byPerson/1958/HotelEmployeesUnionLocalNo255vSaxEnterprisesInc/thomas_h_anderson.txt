violence
and
locations
of
hotels
(inaudible)
i
conclude
with
the
court
the
statement
that
mr.
sibley
was
engaged
in
making
at
the
close
or
just
for
the
lunch
and
recess.
the
record
in
the
case
will
show
and
when
i
say
the
record
in
the
case,
i
mean
the
record
--
the
records
in
these
cases
as
well
as
the
records
of
other
cases
which
were
not
brought
up
here
will
show
that
there
was
violence,
intimidation
or
coercion
in
some
form
or
another,
committed
at
the
following
hotels,
a
list
of
which
fills
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
there
was
violence
at
the
saxony
hotel
which
is
before
the
court.
there's
a
record
of
violence
at
page
1233
and
pages
following.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
by
the
circuit
court,
by
the
trial
court?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
was
a
finding
that
mr.
sibley
referred
to
in
his
argument
this
morning
when
his
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
not
per
se.
there
is
a
finding
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
the
striking
and
the
picketing
were
done
against
the
background
of
violence
and
we
cite
to
the
court
these
instances
of
violence
which
we
say,
support
and
demand
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
is
a
finding
in
the
trial
court
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
of
violence
which
was
defined
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
which
statement
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
one
of
the
interlocutory
appeals.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
yes,
sir.
in
the
fontainebleau
case,
which
is
the
last
of
the
cases
that
we've
decided
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i'm
talking
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes.
i
was
simply
saying
this,
your
honor.
that
in
the
saxony
case,
there
is
evidence
of
violence
and
i
was
asked
whether
there
was
a
finding
by
the
court
that
there
was
evidence
of
violence
in
the
saxony
case,
if
i
misstated
the
question
and
the
answer
is,
no,
that
there's
any
direct
finding.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
no,
sir.
because
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
the
fontainebleau
case
which
on
the
authority
of
which
all
of
the
cases,
presently
here,
were
decided,
said
that
the
background
of
the
picketing
was
enmeshed
in
a
pattern
of
violence.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think
it's
the
equivalent
to
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
--
you'll
find
it
on
page
1233
of
the
record
and
pages
following
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
and
33.
there
are
several
pages
then
which
various
testimonies
of
the
various
witnesses
were
given
concerning
single
acts
of
violence
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
force
or
intimidation.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
in
some
instances,
there
was
--
there
were
names
called
such
as
was
the
case
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
there
were
threats,
there
was
coercion
and
there
was
actual
physical
combat.
there
was
one
man
who
was
badly
beaten.
there
was
a
girl
who
was
beaten.
there
were
any
number
of
instances
of
actual
physical
combat.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
i
can't
pinpoint
into
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
i
have
to
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
have
it
right
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
have
it
right
here.
the
witness
rogers
walters
who
was
the
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
it's
at
page
1233
to
1236.
said
that
if
they
--
el
morocco
was
immediately
across
the
street
that
the
morning
of
the
strike,
the
witnesses
attempt
to
cross
the
street
to
the
el
morocco
and
was
accosted
by
a
few
men,
who
threatened
the
witness'
home,
his
parents
and
his
car.
the
witness'
car
was
damaged
by
glass
being
broken
in
the
windshield,
inside,
while
the
same
is
parked
at
the
saxony
parking
lot.
the
witness,
val
turner,
whose
testimony
will
be
found
at
1242
of
the
record,
was
the
business
manager
of
the
bardot
hotel
and
he
testified,
in
substance,
that
after
the
picket
line
was
established,
witness
has
went
to
his
car
on
april
the
13th,
1955
and
found
all
the
tire
sliced
and
gasoline
tank
ripped
out.
the
car
was
parked
at
34th
street
near
the
robert
richter
hotel.
the
witness,
frank
short,
testified
at
page
1246
of
the
record
that
he
was
employed
as
a
lobby
porter
at
the
saxony.
after
the
picket
line
was
established,
he
boarded
a
bus
and
got
off
at
lincoln
road
and
lenox
avenue.
he
was
accosted
by
three
men
who
threatened
to
take
care
of
him,
the
night,
calling
him
a
scab.
witness
gave
each
of
the
individuals
who
accosted
him
and
filed
also
that
he
might
have
fought.
he
was
told
you'd
got
enough
report
back
to
work.
the
witness,
patricia
fitzgerald,
who
was
employed
at
the
saxony
hotel,
testified,
in
substance,
that
on
the
night
of
april
the
13th
after
the
picket
line
was
established,
she
attempted
to
drive
home
with
two
others.
one,
willy,
was
on
strike
and
wearing
a
sign
as
the
witness
entered
the
car,
willy
grabs
her,
but
was
protected
by
an
--
she
was
protected
by
an
employee
whose
company
she
was
in,
and
testified
that
she
received
telephone
calls
at
her
home
and
when
she
would
answer
the
party
who
obviously
--
the
phone
would
hang
up.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
now,
it
sounds
familiar
with
the
statement
you
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no,
as
to
all
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
all
of
the
hotels
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
--
that
are
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
the
last
part
of
the
section
3.
the
--
the
opinion
in
the
fontainebleau
case
is
included
as
an
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
through
the
chief
justice
says
this
--
that
is
page
52,
appendix
a.
“the
record
as
a
whole,
indicates
that
the
picketing
was
precipitated
by
the
union
for
the
purpose
of
requiring
both
petitioner
and
some
employees,
who
recognize
it
is
or
representing
people
of
said
employees.”
it
was
accompanied
by
acts
of
violence
or
near
violence
condemned
by
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
your
honor,
all
of
the
cases
here
on
--
on
certiorari
were
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
the
fontainebleau
case.
and
we
say
that
the
statements
made
in
that
opinion
most
necessarily
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
what
their
position,
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
was
no
full
evidence
of
violence
in
that
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
answer
that
question,
yes,
except
for
the
--
the
situation
regarding
the
chronology
of
the
cases.
the
fontainebleau
hotel
was
the
last
one
which
was
attacked
by
this
--
by
the
picketers.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
they
--
their
picketing
however
and
the
acts
which
we
say
constituted
violence
in
those
cases,
occurred
up
and
down
the
street
where
these
hotels
are
--
are
built.
and
started
in
april
of
1955
whereas,
the
fontainebleau
hotel
case
did
not
come
in
until
december
of
1955.
and
the
basis
of
the
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
acts
of
violence,
force
and
in
coercion
and
intimidation,
were
that
they
presented
a
pattern
of
behavior.
and
as
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power,
had
the
right
to
stop
the
picketing
where
it
started
rather
than
wait
for
the
infection
to
spread
all
up
and
down
the
street.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
because,
your
honor,
we
say
that
there
was
violence
in
some
of
those
other
cases.
and
if
you
will
bear
with
me
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
location
of
the
hotels,
if
your
honor
would
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
was
a
finding
in
that
case
against
this,
but
there
are
also
cases,
your
honors,
in
which
violence
unquestionably
occurred
in
the
same
pattern
which
were
not
brought
up
to
this
court
for
review.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
1957.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
and
your
honors
will
--
will
listen
to
the
enumeration
of
these
hotels
and
where
they
are
located
and
so
forth.
i
think
you
will
see
very
clearly
they
were
in
violence,
broke
out
in
front
of
one
or
two
of
the
hotels,
that
necessarily
is
--
or
spilled
over
into
the
others.
for
example,
the
saxony
hotel
is
located
at
3020
--
3201
collins
avenue.
the
monte
carlo
at
6551,
the
casablanca
at
6345,
there
was
no
question
about
the
existence
of
violence
at
the
casablanca
and
it
has
not
been
appealed
here.
there
was
violence
at
the
sherry
frontenac
at
6565
collins
avenue
and
the
violence
there
can
be
found
in
page
1147
of
this
record.
there
was
violence
at
the
san
souci
hotel
which
is
at
3101
collins
avenue
which
is,
of
course,
quite
near
to
the
saxony
hotel
and
the
violence
there
will
be
testified
too,
at
page
1226
of
the
record.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
there
was
no
finding
in
the
lower
court
that
there
was
any
violence
committed
on
the
picket
line.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
are
12
cases
out
of
the
original
22.
they're
on
appeal
to
this
court.
they're
on
certiorari
to
this
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
in
none
of
the
cases
before
this
court
today
is
there
an
affirmative
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
there
was
violence
committed
by
the
picketers.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
is
a
general
finding
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
the
fontainebleau
case,
the
actual
committed
against
the
background
of
violence.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think
in
the
san
marino
case,
there
was
no
finding
of
violence,
but
there
was
none
alleged
there.
now,
if
i
may
proceed
with
this,
you
will
notice
how
closely
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
we
have
--
we
have
references
in
our
brief
that
i
think
would
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
court.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
now
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think
your
honor
could
find
it
in
the
brief.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
your
honor,
there
was
no
finding
of
violence
by
the
trial
court
in
any
of
the
cases,
except
the
cases
that
are
not
here
on
appeal.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
there
--
there
was
a
finding
that
the
court's
familiar
with
through
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
to
me
that
there
was
no
finding
of
violence
in
the
saxony
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
and
there
was
--
there
was
a
finding,
if
i
may
proceed
to
answer
the
question
this
way,
there
was
a
finding
against
the
union
of
violence
in
the
casablanca
case
which
was
not
brought
up.
there
was
violence
alleged,
but
not
found
in
the
sherry
frontenac
case.
there
was
violence
alleged,
but
not
found
in
the
san
souci.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
that
is
included
in
the
general
opinion
in
the
--
in
the
saxony
case.
now,
there
was
a
finding
of
violence
against
the
union
and
the
(inaudible)
hotel
which
has
not
been
brought
up
here.
and
there
was
a
finding
of
violence
in
the
empress
hotel
which
has
not
been
brought
up
here.
and
there
was
a
finding
of
violence,
i
thought,
in
one
other,
but,
i
think,
i'm
mistaken.
there
was
--
there
was
a
finding
in
general
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
fontainebleau
case,
but
that
case
too,
was
not
brought
up
here.
and
that
brings
me,
if
i
may
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes.
yes,
you're
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i'm
sure
that
they
are
citing
a
brief
--
filed
a
brief
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think,
based
on
the
record
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
think
it's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
they
have
got
the
briefs
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
but
not
all
of
them
were
there,
some
of
the
briefs
that
they
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
by
who?
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
now,
i
think
that
our
demonstrators
to
the
courts
officially
in
our
petition
with
respect
to
the
proximity
of
these
hotels
to
each
of.
and
that
sometimes,
they
were
in
the
same
block,
sometimes
in
the
next
block.
but
if
when
the
court
found
or
when
we
contended
that
violence
are
breaking
out
as
one,
we
invoke
that
ancient
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
protect
the
--
the
people
against
force
and
violence
in
the
union
and
all
the
others.
now,
i
should
like
to
proceed
from
there
to
answer
the
question
concerning
the
existence
of
the
preemption
theory.
at
the
close
of
the
original
or
the
morning
argument,
mr.
sibley
was
engaged
in
telling
the
court
the
matter
concerning
the
filings
of
these
supplemental
answers.
and
he
had
proceeded
down
to
the
point
where
he
stated
that
an
answer
was
filed
perhaps
timely
in
the
san
marino
case,
but
where
it
had
not
been
passed
upon
by
the
court.
now,
in
that
case,
if
the
court
will
turn
to
page
434
of
the
record,
you
will
find
the
interlocutory
order
which
is
presented
by
that
court
in
which
in
the
first
--
the
first
statement
of
findings
in
the
record.
in
the
order
and
he
said
that
the
allegations
of
the
supplemental
answer
alleging
interstate
commerce
and
averring
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
or
not
supported
by
evidence.
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
and
the
subject
matter.
it
was
in
that
same
hotel
case
that
the
court
then
proceeded
to
call
an
election
by
a
commissioner
appointed
by
him
to
determine
whether
or
not,
the
members
of
the
defendant
union
were
also
employees
of
the
hotel.
and
of
course,
there
was
no
machinery
provided
by
the
florida
laws
for
that,
nor
was
the
question
material.
the
question
concerned
the
representation,
at
time
that
the
complaints
were
filed
or
the
time
that
the
picketing
commenced,
which
was
shortly
probably
thereto.
so,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
what
the
choice
of
the
employees
was
later
on,
if,
in
fact,
the
union
had
no
right
to
picket
the
plaintiff's
property
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed,
it
made
no
difference
what
state
of
facts
may
have
existed
subsequently,
which
gave
the
employees
the
right
to
determine
as
to
the
union
being
its
collective
bargaining
agent.
i
think
that's
a
self-evident
proposition.
the
criticism
which
counsel
directed
to
the
action
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
reversing
that
part
of
the
decree,
i
thought,
was
not
well
founded.
that
was
the
part
of
the
order,
namely,
the
right
of
the
commissioner
to
hold
the
election,
which
was
the
only
part
it
was
addressed
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
the
appeal.
it
was
all
that
the
court
had
before
it.
so,
when
it
reversed
the
case
for
all
of
any
authority
and
the
chancellor
conducts
such
an
election,
that
was
all
that
the
court
could
do,
and
that's
all
that
it
presumed
to
do.
but
in
that
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
that
appeal,
it
held
that
the
evidence
had
not
been
shown
by
the
--
by
the
union
to
establish
its
contention
that
it
was
the
bargaining
agent
of
these
employees.
now
then,
when
the
cases
came
back
--
and
a
rather
significant
point
is
made
that
that's
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
when
the
cases
came
back,
it
was,
in
effect,
concluded
by
all
the
parties
that
it
had
been
thoroughly
tried
and
there
was
no
more
falling
use
in
taking
testimony.
sometimes,
several
days
had
been
consumed
by
the
taking
of
testimony
in
matters
which
were
then
fresh
in
everyone's
mind.
they
--
there
was
nothing
else
for
the
court
to
do
then,
but
to
have
the
cases
submitted
on
final
hearing
and
that
was
done
by
a
stipulation.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
your
honor,
in
the
san
marino
case,
now
i'll
take
that
out
just
to
–
as
an
illustration.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
oh,
i
see.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
in
my
opinion,
if
the
union
under
the
fontainebleau
and
the
previous
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
bona
fide
represented
a
substantial
number
of
the
employees
or
of
the
hotels,
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
indicate
that
they
had
represented
those
employees
and
which
employees
they
represent.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
i
do
not
think
the
conclusion
is
warranted,
because
in
the
san
marino
case,
the
complaint
made
out
the
case
of
where
the
--
the
union
--
where
the
hotel
employer
faced
with
this
threat
by
the
union,
himself,
conducted
an
election
and
found
that
only
two
of
his
employees
won.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
we
do
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
they
could've
done
so.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
well,
i
do
not
think
the
court
lost
it
before
that
the
--
that
the
employees
of
the
hotel,
would've
engaged
in
that
sort
of
conduct.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
if
your
honor
will
read
the
--
the
minutes
of
the
conference
between
mr.
sibley
and
the
union
leaders
that
he
referred
to
in
his
arguments,
you
will
find
that
this
matter
was
thoroughly
gone
into
and
he
was
--
and
he
requested
that
that
--
some
arrangements
like
be
worked
out
and
that
it
was
never
concluded.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
there
was
no
claim
for
--
for
violence
in
the
san
marino
case,
there
was
no
violence,
and
that
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
in
the
san
marino
case,
for
example?
we
say
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
florida
as
enunciated
in
its
recent
opinion
that
a
--
that
a
labor
organization
has
no
right
to
put
up
a
picket
line
in
front
of
a
places
--
place
of
business
claiming
that
it
is
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
when
it
does
not
represent
a
substantial
number
of
its
employees
and
the
picketing
second
line
was
not
put
up
in
good
faith.
mr.
thomas
h.
anderson
thank
you.
