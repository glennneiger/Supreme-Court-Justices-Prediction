that

i
believe

of

convenience

were
all

of

even
though
it's
different
somewhat
as
i
shall
later
explain.
the
--
it
is
difficult
with
--
throughout
the
separate
records
and
12
separate
proceedings
to
trace
the
course
of
this
litigation
which
has
an
important
bearing
upon
the
case
in
this
court.
and
in
order
to
--
in
some
convenient
way
since
a
stipulation
to
consolidate
it
was
not
available
because
of
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
thought
were
good
and
sufficient
reason,
i'm
sure
they
were.
i
thought
it
might
be
convenient
for
the
court
to
set
out
a
litigation
chronology.
and
you
may
find
it
convenient
as
i
make
my
argument
to
refer
to
that
chronology.
it
is
contained
in
appendix
b
through
our
brief,
the
green
brief
and
sets
out
in
quite
graphic
form
the
history
of
this
litigation.
i
shall
have
occasion
to
make
reference
to
the
history
as
we
go
along.
and
i
think
your
honors
may
find
it,
as
i
say,
convenient
to
--
to
examine
this
chronology.
first,
let
me
address
myself
to
the
background
of
facts
before
turning
to
the
course
of
the
litigation.
in
february
1955,
the
petitioner
union,
which
organizes
hotel
and
restaurant
workers
throughout
the
country,
began
a
campaign
to
organize
the
employees
in
the
service
trades
in
the
miami
beach,
miami
area
in
florida.
the
record
in
the
case
shows
that
while
these,
as
the
respondents
probably
goes
in
their
answers
and
pleadings,
are
luxury
hotels
and
as
perhaps,
we
can
recognize
from
the
names
of
the
hotels
which
are
set
forth
from
the
chronology,
there
was
a
considerable
background
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
wages,
hours
and
the
poor
working
conditions
of
these
hotels.
and
consequently,
the
campaign
for
organization
met
with
considerable
success.
now,
normally,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
the
workers
having
been
organized
and
the
hotels
themselves
have
engaged
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce,
the
recourse
would
have
been
made
by
the
union
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
election
and
certification.
however,
it
was
not
available
to
the
union
because
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
exercise
of
its
alleged
discretion,
and
this
matter
will
come
before
this
court
immediately
following
in
case
no.
21,
where
this
is
challenged
by
the
union
by
way
of
a
--
injunction
proceeding
to
compel
the
labor
board
to
take
jurisdiction
in
this
very
--
this
very
dispute.
however,
in
--
at
the
setting
as
it
stood
in
the
organizational
stage
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
because
the
injunctions
are
outstanding.
and
unless
they
are
reversed
by
this
court,
it
will
still
be
enjoined
by
final
orders
of
the
--
of
the
courts
in
florida.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
could
be
vacated.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
should
have.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
argument
that
will
be
made
to
you,
this
is
not
my
case
to
argue
and
i
don't
want
to
anticipate
my
brother's
argument.
mr.
braham,
the
general
counsel
of
the
union
will
argue
that.
but
it
will
be
his
argument
that
the
board
was
compelled
to
take
jurisdiction
of
representation
cases
under
the
statute
as
agreed.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
it
is
relevant.
and
i
will
argue
that
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
i
will
argue
that
as
one
of
the
points
that
issue
here.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
am
making
the
point
here.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
in
the
penalty
of
whether
the
board
as
guss
points
out.
in
the
penalty
of
the
board
was
justified
or
not
justified
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
in
denying
jurisdiction,
it
is
our
argument
here
that
their
preemption
existed
and
i
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
it
was.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
national
board
refused
to
act
both
in
representation
cases
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
and
in
--
in
this
very
controversy
in
involving
this
very
--
this
specific
hotel.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
believe
it
is
and
i
will
turn
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
don't
--
i
can't
answer
that
because
both
issues
that
i
raised
are
constitutional.
the
preemption
issue
is,
of
course,
based
on
the
supremacy
clause.
and
on
the
commerce
clause,
the
issue
of
free
speech
is
raised
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
cannot
say
which
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
constitutional
argument
this
court
may
choose
to
rest
its
decision
on
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
if
it
agrees
with
me.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
except
--
except
in
both
cases,
it
arises
out
of
the
constitution.
and
i
know
of
no
rule
which
gives
priority
one
over
the
other.
but
on
both
grounds,
it
is
my
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
that
determines
--
that
is
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
based
upon
a
constitutional
argument.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
merits,
of
course,
come
up
as
a
constitutional
assailment
on
the
injunction.both
points,
however,
are
raised
and
left
with
the
court
to
determine.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
they
were.
and
i
shall
point
that
although
there
are
some
argument
about
it,
mr.
justice
brennan.
they
were
raised
as
the
chronology
will
point
out
when
i
go
into
the
chronology
of
various
statements.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
doesn't
agree
with
me
but
i
will
be
prepared
to
discuss
that,
if
i
may,
at
a
subsequent
point.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
no.
i
do
not
want
to
argue
the
question
of
whether
the
labor
board
can
be
mandated
into
a
certain
jurisdiction
whether
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
will
argue
that
by
all
means.
it
is
a
strong
argument
of
ours
that
whether
or
not
the
board
had
discretions
or
refused
to
exercise
jurisdiction,
this
is
a
commerce
case
covered
by
the
national
act
and
therefore,
the
florida
courts
had
no
right
to
issue
the
injunction.
by
way
of
background
to
that
point
in
both
cases,
since
it
applies
to
both
cases,
it
is
clear
that
this
industry
and
these
hotels
are
engaged
in
commerce.
southern
florida
has
two
and
a
half
million
visitors
a
year
from
other
states.
the
great
majority
are
accommodated
by
the
given
hotels
and
the
other
hotels,
150
in
total
number,
who
are
members
of
the
association
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
to
which
these
hotels
belong.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
do
not
believe
it
is
an
issue.
the
government
concedes
it
in
no.
21.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
were
--
there
were
stipulations
that
witnesses
would
testify
that
these
hotels
were
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
these
--
the
stipulation
was
--
the
affidavits
were
then
denied
on
the
ground
that
it
was
immaterial
and
irrelevant
in
our
cases.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
objection.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
just
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
i
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
the
--
the
board
itself,
as
you
will
see
in
21,
concedes
that
these
are
engaged
in
commerce.
it
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
position
that
in
these
particular
cases,
proof
was
offered
on
these
particular
points.
the
objection
to
that
proof
sustained
in
the
lower
court
in
its
decree
was
that
these
were
immaterial.
we
say
they
were
material.
that
was
the
only
objection.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
this
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
correct.
and
we
think
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
think
it
plainly
does.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
--
our
question
also,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
was
assigned
as
their
preemption
issue.
it
was
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
supreme
court
of
florida
just
ignored
it
in
its
final
decision.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
--
the
general
information
which
i'm
giving
about
the
state
of
the
general
industry
is
the
information
which
you
can
take
notice
of
as
presented
in
21.
i
thought
i
would
give
it
as
a
little
background
of
the
commerce
aspects.
for
example,
a
$100,000,000
of
food
and
lodging
is
furnished
to
visitors.
and
this
industry
is
the
controlling
industry
of
southern
florida.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
1954,
over
1,200,000
tourists
came
to
the
great
miami
area.
our
affidavit
show
most
of
them
came
by
interstate
carriers,
railroads
and
--
and
airplanes.
now,
i
have
mentioned
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
of
organization
that
it
did
not
appear
that
recourse
to
the
labor
board
was
available
to
the
union.
although
it
shall
appear
from
21
that
not
withstanding
under
the
announced
policies
of
the
board,
it
was
not
available.
the
parties
tried
to
go
to
the
board
and
were
turned
down
to
the
board.
now,
after
organizing
the
employees,
the
--
the
union
went
to
the
hotel
association
and
to
various
of
these
employers
and
said
to
them,
“we
have
organized
your
employees.
and
since
access
to
the
board
does
not
appear
to
be
available,
we
would
like
to
have
a
secret
election
so
as
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
we
represent
the
employees
and
so
that
we
can
engage
in
collective
bargaining
with
you
for
these
employees.”
the
record
shows
that
this
offer
of
the
union
was
affirmed
by
these
hotels.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
was
not,
justice
stewart.
there
was
no
machinery.
i'm
going
to
refer
to
the
state
law
in
just
a
minute
to
show
what
the
state
was
and
the
law
was
in
florida.
the
state
law
is
set
forth
on
page
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
you
will
see
that
while
the
state
law
declares
it
to
be
the
policy
of
the
state
to
encourage
the
right
to
self-organization
and
to
engage
in
concerted
activities,
the
state
of
florida
prescribe
neither
a
method
for
resolving
representation
cases
for
elections
nor
did
it
prescribe
any
procedure
for
handling
unfair
labor
practices.
this
is
a
declaration
of
general
policy.
and
it's
very
interesting
to
note,
although
i
don't
think
it's
involved
in
this
case
because
the
florida
courts
avoided
this
issue
except
one
lower
court
withheld
it
that
this
provision
unconstitutional.
section
9,
which
appears
on
page
3,
it
says,
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
--
person
to
participate
in
a
strike
or
a
walkout
without
the
same
being
authorized
by
majority
vote
of
the
employees
to
be
governed
thereby
provided
that
this
shall
not
prohibit
any
person
from
terminating
employment
of
his
own
volition.”
there
is
no
procedure
in
the
state
law
for
determining
any
majority
vote
on
the
strike
issues.
this
suggests
an
expression
unaccompanied
by
any
implementation
machinery.
now,
in
this
state,
i
--
i
should
point
out
that
the
union
in
addition
to
making
a
request
for
secret
election
published
advertisements
to
this
effect
saying
that
they
wanted
secret
election.
and
they
sent
copies
of
these
letters
to
these
respective
employers.
now,
they
got
nowhere.
and
finally,
now,
i
turn
to
my
chart,
if
i
may,
finally
you
will
see
what
began
to
happen.and
we
will
start
with
same
--
the
strike
at
saxony.
and
by
the
way,
i
would
like
to
correct
a
typographical
error
where
it
says
april
3rd
in
appendix
b
on
saxony
that
should
be
april
13th,
the
first
in
the
designation.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
april
13th.
now,
you
see
that
in
saxony,
the
union,
asking
for
recognition,
getting
nowhere,
finally,
called
a
strike
and
began
picketing
the
premises
at
saxony.
immediately
following
on
april
14th,
a
complaint
was
filed
which
complaint
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
the
record.
the
complaint
alleged
in
its
complaint
which
is
not
unusual
in
cases
involving
labor
unions
and
employers.
and
by
the
way,
this
complaint
bears
out
the
admonition
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
many
years
ago
in
his
book
on
labor
injunctions.
it's
one
thing
to
(inaudible)
allegations.
it's
another
thing
when
you
get
proof.
this
complaint
alleged
that
a
couple
of
carpetbaggers
from
the
north
came
in
to
organize
the
union,
that
the
employees
did
not
want
the
organization
and
that
the
picket
line
was
formed,
that
violence
had
been
committed
on
the
picket
line.
and
that
also
the
object
of
the
picketing
was
to
coerce
the
employer
to
coerce
the
employees
to
join
the
union.
this
is
in
essence
with
the
complaint
set.
and
later,
i
shall
point
out
that
some
of
the
other
complaints
were
quite
identical.
it
is
interesting
but
irrelevant
really
to
point
out
that
that
was
a
proof
came
in,
the
three
named
defendants
who
were
the
business
agents
and
officers
of
the
union,
who
were
residents
of
florida
for
32
years,
for
17
years,
for
18
years,
respectively.
it
also
appears
from
the
record
that
the
plaintiffs,
in
many
instances,
who
owned
these
hotels,
were
residents
of
northern
and
western
cities.
in
any
event,
complaint
filed,
and
you
will
notice
that
immediately
following
on
april
17th,
the
strike
and
picketing
commends
at
the
sans
souci
hotel
and
immediately
following
strike
and
picketing
commenced
at
the
sherry
frontenac
hotel.
now,
it
is
important
for
your
honors
to
know
what
it
was
that
in
the
picketing
that
was
complained
about
and
the
--
the
picket
sign
which
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
the
record,
and
i
wish
to
quote
it,

and
factually
set
forth
what
had
happened
at
that
time.
now,
chancellor
held
a
hearing,
and
i
refer
to
sax
--
to
saxony
at
the
moment.
there
were
other
hearings
held,
as
i
explained
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
consolidated,
but
it
was
understood
that
each
judge
would
handle
his
own
case
or
cases.
this
was
a
convenient
mechanism.
they
were
not
consolidated
for
all
purposes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
under
florida
law,
at
that
time,
it
alleged
the
cause
of
action
on
the
coercion
aspect
and
on
violence.
under
florida
law
at
that
state,
as
florida
law
was
then,
it
alleged
a
cause
of
action.
on
the
other
hand,
of
course,
the
chancellor
was
perfectly
within
his
equity
powers
and
asking
for
a
hearing
before
he
issued
an
injunction.
the
hearing
was
held
on
may
15th
and
witnesses
were
heard,
and
affidavits
were
offered
and
on
--
on
may
5th.
and
the
--
well,
excuse
me,
the
hearings
were
held
the
april
28th
and
30th,
i
skipped
one.
on
may
5th,
after
the
hearings,
the
chancellor
issued
an
order
denying
the
injunction.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
he
did.
and
the
findings
are
set
forth
on
page
10
of
the
record
to
which
we
might
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
found
no
violence.
in
fact,
he
said
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
said
that
there
was
--
there
was
no
--
not
a
sufficient
showing
made
to
him
to
--
and
you
will
find
it
on
page
11.
the
course
of
the
opinion
finds
the
plaintiff
has
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
projectorily
on
the
basis
of
manner
of
the
picketing
and
the
method
when
which
it
is
being
conducted.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
on
the
coercion,
he
said
this
presented
a
very
serious
issue.
and
he
wanted
further
hearings
on
an
after
answer
file,
and
he
left
it
in
that
setting.
in
other
words,
he
denied
the
injunction
on
the
basis
of
violence.
on
coercion,
he
said
this
did
present
under
the
law
of
florida
a
substantive
issue.
he
wanted
answer
to
come
in.
he
was
going
to
hold
a
hearing.
in
the
meantime,
he
denied
the
injunction.
the
plaintiffs
promptly
proceeded
to
ask
for
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
and
they
--
they
took
the
case
up.
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
--
i
want
to
skip
the
secret
election.
i
think
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
that.
but
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
in
a
--
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time,
may
the
27th,
handed
down
a
decision
in
the
saxony
case.
that's
the
first
of
seven
decisions
of
the
florida
court
which
are
involved
in
this
controversy.
now,
before
i
review
the
saxony
decision,
in
addition
to
the
law
of
florida
at
that
time
being
that
the
coercion
of
the
employer
to
coerce
the
employees
was
invalid.
the
law
of
florida,
as
stated
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
cothron
case,
which
is
50
so.2d
366,
1952,
a
recent
--
very
recent
decision
is
this.
and
this
is
very
important
on
subsequent
development.
here's
the
law
of
florida
as
stated
by
the
supreme
court,
“there
is
no
rule,”
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
369,
“regulation
or
law
of
this
state
which
requires
a
notice
to
the
employer
of
the
reasons
for
an
impending
strike
or
as
a
prerequisite
to
picketing,
and
the
courts
are
without
power
to
supply
such
rule,
regulation
or
law.”
in
other
words,
the
florida
supreme
court
at
that
time
said
that
there
was
no
rule
which
required
any
notice
as
a
prerequisite
to
picketing
and
went
on
to
say,
and
it
had
been
gratuitous
in
light
of
what
happened
later,
the
courts
are
without
power
to
supply
such
rule,
regulation
or
law.
now,
the
--
the
case
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
on
supersedeas.
and
then
the
supreme
court,
on
may
the
27th,
handed
down
its
first
opinion
in
this
--
this
controversy,
which
we
might,
for
convenience,
call
the
saxony
opinion
in
which
it
was
printed
on
record
pages
16
to
20.
it
appears
in
the
chart
which
i
have
asked
--
which
i
have
called
to
your
attention.
now,
on
saxony,
the
court
said
this
as
--
by
way
of
decision.
and
then,
they
have
something
to
say
by
way
of
dicta.
by
way
of
decision
it
said,
“it
affirmed
the
violence,
no
violence
is
pointed.”
and
this
is
very
important
in
light
of
an
allegation
that
counsel
makes
in
his
brief
that
there's
some
elements
of
violence.
here,
we
have
a
chancellor
finding
no
violence,
express
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
in
these
cases,
not
in
these
laws.
not
in
these
cases.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
in
the
cases
before
it.
and
by
the
way,
i
should
point
out
to
you
that
while
counsel
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
by
the
courts,
except
later,
we'll
come
to
fontainebleau,
another
case
where
the
violence
matter
entered.
it's
not
this
case.
i
want
to
point
out
also
in
light
of
counsel's
argument
later
about
certain
background
of
violence
or
whatever
he
calls
it.
these
are
separate
cases,
mind
you,
heard
for
convenience.
mr.
sibley,
my
learned
friend
here,
at
page
12
and
13
of
the
record,
when
he
started
to
present
these
series
of
cases,
said
to
the
chancellor,
“the
only
distinction,
your
honor,
that
i
can
point
out
between
the
cases
may
be
some
specific
acts
of
violence
which
will
be
applicable
to
the
particular
cases
and
not
necessarily
to
all
cases.”
now,
the
saxony
order
no.
1
affirmed,
as
you
will
see
from
the
opinion
of
the
violence,
affirmed
the
chancellor.
on
the
coercion
aspect
of
the
case,
the
court
said
that
that
was
a
--
that
was
an
offense
under
the
law
of
florida.
and
then
they
enunciated,
as
a
matter
of
equity
doctrine,
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
that
base
of
equity
doctrine,
at
least
in
my
jurisdiction
in
illinois,
this
had
not
been
equity
doctrine,
that
it
was
necessary
to
accept
the
sworn
allegation
as
--
for
the
--
the
chancellor
to
accept
the
sworn
statement
as
true
on
this
point,
absent
an
answer
and
absent
proof
to
the
contrary.
and
on
that
basis,
substantively,
the
court
reversed
and
said
the
injunction
should
have
been
issued,
no
answer
hasn't
been
filed
at
that
time
the
matter
was
heard.
then
the
court
went
on
to
something
new.
and
here
is
--
here
is
an
important
aspect
of
the
subsequent
chronology
of
these
cases.
despite
cothron
and
without
reference
to
cothron
which
said
that
there
was
no
rule
and
the
courts
couldn't
give
a
rule
as
to
prerequisites
for
picketing,
and
without
distinguishing
the
cothron
decision,
having
disposed
of
the
case
on
the
coercion
point,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
went
on
and
said,
and
i
quote,
“in
order
for
picketing
to
be
lawful,
the
union
must
establish
that
the
employees
had
chosen
it
as
their
representative.
it
must
also
inform
the
employer
the
object
to
be
accomplished
by
the
picketing.
it
must
afford
to
the
employer
a
fair
opportunity
to
engage
in
negotiations.
and
finally,
the
picketing
must
convey
information
concerning
the
facts
of
the
dispute."
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
is
on
record
page
20.
now,
this
language
is
set
forth.
this
--
record
18
and
20
it
starts,
mr.
justice
black,
on
page
18
in
the
opinion
and
then
goes
on
through
20
where
the
various
prerequisites
are
now
set
forth.
are
you
--
mind
you,
it
is
important
to
know
that
when
the
strike
was
called,
none
of
these
requisites
were
in
the
law
of
florida.
in
fact,
they
were
expressly
vitiated
by
the
law
of
florida
as
against
to
it
in
the
cothron
decision.
now,
the
next
day,
in
obedience
to
the
mandate
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
starts
page
18.
it
said,
“without
doubt,
a
--
it's
first
paragraph
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
“without
doubt,
a
labor
organization
has
the
right
to
engage
in
peaceful
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
picketing
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
in
order
for
such
picketing.”
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
this
is
on
the
truth
concerning
the
facts.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
is
the
last
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
this
is
the
last
one.
it
is
at
the
bottom
--
the
last
paragraph
in
the
page.
it
cannot
be
said
that
they
conveyed
information
concerning
the
facts
of
the
labor
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
dispute.
i
--
i
jumped
at
the
various
parts
to
piece
out
the
--
the
--
now,
the
next
day,
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
i
read
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
part.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
statutory
law.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
have
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
have
a
right
to
change
the
rule.
later,
i
suggest
the
combination
of
changes
of
rules,
which
went
on
in
the
seven
opinions,
was
such
that
it
may
well
be
that
in
the
combination
of
changes
which
culminated
in
no
picketing,
due
process
was
violated.
but
at
this
moment
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
not
--
the
court
may
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
they
substantively
do.
the
--
now,
we
turn
--
and
you
will
see
the
chancellor,
obedient
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
issued
then
a
preliminary
injunction.
and
i
want
to
point
out
the
character
of
the
injunction
because
we
--
this
is
the
injunction
which
later
became
permanent
and
we
attacked
the
injunction
on
various
grounds
in
this
court
as
i
shall
later
point
out.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
light
of
their
statement
in
cothron,
their
latest
expression
in
1952,
i
felt
that
that
was
controlling.
and
in
cothron,
they
had
used
very
straightforward
language
as
you
will
later
see
from
their
other
opinion
where
they
say
we
must
forthrightly
face
up
to
the
fact
that
cothron
is
inconsistent.
and
then
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
it
is.
c-o-t-h-r-o-n,
cothron.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
citation
was
there.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
is
in
the
main
brief.
i
gave
you
the
reference.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
59
so.2d
366
at
page
369.
we've
cited
that
in
the
brief
at
various
points.
now,
so
the
next
day
a
preliminary
injunction
was
entered.
the
preliminary
injunction
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
31
and
32.
and
since
part
of
our
attack
on
the
injunctions
of
the
--
first,
the
whole
injunctional
order
and
then
various
components
of
it,
i
wish
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
that
injunctional
order.
and
you
will
see
that
this
is
a
broad
injunctional
order.
page
31,
starting
at
page
31,
“the
union
is
enjoined
from
picketing
in
the
hotel
and
then,
they
are
also
enjoined
by
a
separate
restraint
from
publishing
or
causing
to
be
published
any
statements
to
the
effect
of
a
strike,
walkout
or
cessation
of
work
is
in
effect
at
the
saxony
hotel
or
that
the
plaintiff
refuses
to
negotiate
or
recognize
the
defendant
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent.”
then,
they're
further
enjoined
from
carrying
any
placards.
they're
further
enjoined
from
molesting,
interference
or
violence
in
effect.
i
mentioned
that
because
the
restraint
against
broad
publication
is
an
issue
in
this
case
as
well
as
picketing.
and
this
is
not
a
--
an
academic
or
theoretical
issue
to
be
derived
from
the
injunction
from
picketing,
as
you
have
seen
in
some
other
cases
and
commented
on.
this
is
the
case
where
the
union
had
published
advertisements
in
all
the
newspapers
saying
they
had
a
strike
against
this
hotel
and
handed
out
handbills
into
penalty
of
picketing.
and
this
restraint
was
designed
to
prevent
a
publication
in
newspapers
of
their
dispute
with
the
employer.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
outside
the
state.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
published
in
new
york,
in
cleveland,
cincinnati,
several
states,
chicago,
i've
forgotten
the
exact
places.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
--
i
find
nothing
--
i
find
nothing.
i
think
counsel
argues
that
they
had
no
right
to
negotiate
but
the
statements
made
is
incomparable
to
the
statement
made
in
the
picket
sign.
this
hotel
refuses
to
negotiate
with
the
union.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon?
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
most
exuberant.
later,
i
shall
point
out
a
change
in
the
picket
signs
and
statements
or
attempted
statements,
even
more
limited
in
character
as
we
go
through
the
history
of
this
case
in
some
of
the
later
hotels.
the
statement
was
changed
to
read
as
follows.
this
hotel
refuses
to
aid
in
determining
its
employees'
bargaining
agent.that
was
the
extent
of
the
statement
made
later.
now,
if
you
will
go
to
this
next
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
they
were
enjoined.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
--
in
north
east
texas.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
individual.
well
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
--
the
union
was
involved
and
the
--
and
officers
of
the
union
were
involved.
now,
if
you
will
turn
to
the
next.
now,
at
that
point
sans
souci
remains
dormant
until
the
--
saxony
remains
dormant
until
the
final
decree.
we
now
turn
to
sans
souci
and
sherry
frontenac.
they
are
the
next
two
hotels.
and
if
you
will
look
there,
you
will
see
what
happened.
thereto,
they
denied
a
temporary
injunction
on
the
same
ground,
no
violence
and
the
--
the
holding
the
--
the
other
issue
for
hearing.
but
--
and
--
and
when
the
saxony
case
came
down
on
may
27th,
counsel
on
the
coercion
issue
for
the
hotel
union
immediately
tried
to
meet
the
decision
of
the
court
by
proof
that
there
was
no
coercion
of
the
employers
to
force
people
to
join
the
union.
so
he
noticed
the
case
for
hearing
on
june
4th.
now,
the
supreme
court
was
notified
of
these
because
these
other
cases,
sans
souci
and
sherry
frontenac
were
--
were
on
certiorari
in
this
court.
and
its
response
was
an
immediate
one.
on
june
1,
without
argument
on
that
issue,
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
by
telegram,
and
it's
interesting
to
read
what
happened
in
record
111
or
the
statement
by
counsel,
mr.
--
counsel
for
the
hotels.
and
this
is
the
statement,
“as
your
honors
know
the
response
to
this
telegram
was
a
hurried
meeting
by
the
court
in
which
they
direct
to
the
clerk
to
wire
your
honors
to
enter
these
injunctions,
and
i
believe
such
a
wire
was
received
by
the
members
of
the
court
i
am
so
informed.”
so
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
chancellor
got
a
wire
from
the
supreme
court.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
i'll
--
i'll
try
to
infer
you
the
facts
if
i
can.
the
--
immediately,
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
decision
of
the
court
then
on
the
basis
of
the
other
cases,
the
base
of
saxony
reversing
these
injunctions.
and
then
there
were
--
there
was
then
a
motion
to
vacate,
and
there
were
hearings
in
these
cases
as
you
will
see
from
sans
souci
and
sherry
frotenac.
there
were
hearings
then
after
being
filed.
now,
on
the
hearing
of
these
cases,
the
chancellor
heard
evidence.
and
he
heard
evidence
trying
to
meet
the
dicta
in
the
saxony
case,
that
they
must
represent
somebody
that
the
employer
must
know
about
it,
that
--
that
they
must
give
the
objects
of
what
they
were
attempting
to
do
and
the
signs
were
--
were
peaceful,
signs
were
truthful.
and
upon
the
hearing
of
the
evidence
by
the
chancellor,
the
chancellor
entered
orders
in
which
he
found
again
that
the
union
had
met
the
standards,
which
appeared
by
a
way
of
dicta
in
the
case.
in
some
of
the
cases,
the
union
brought
in
their
people
into
court,
and
they
testified
that
they
were
members
of
the
union.
in
other
cases
where
this
was
objected
to
on
the
ground
that
it
wasn't
the
best
evidence,
the
evidence
of
the
people
themselves
they
brought
in
their
--
their
cards
to
show
that
they
represented
the
people.
now,
you'll
notice
that
on
may
25th,
there
was
a
secret
election
held
in
all
of
these
--
these
hotels.
single
election
was
--
they
tried
to
get
the
companies
to
agree
to
a
secret
election,
they
refused.
they
tried
to
get
them
to
agree
that
a
citizens
committee
would
hold
a
secret
election,
they
refused.
and
they
got
a
--
outstanding
radio
commentator
in
miami
to
hold
a
secret
election
carefully
supervised.
and
at
this
election,
a
majority
--
an
overwhelming
majority
of
workers
in
all
of
these
hotels
voted
to
support
the
union
and
support
the
strike.
it
ran
2000
and
something
to
80.
and
the
brief
contains
a
record
reference
to
each
election.
now,
having
offered
this
evidence,
the
chancellor
having
decided
now
that
they
had
met
the
--
the
limitations
of
the
saxony
case,
the
--
the
chancellor
refused
to
grant
relief.
then,
in
order
to
speed
this
chronology
alone,
then
the
cases
went
up
again
to
the
supreme
court.
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
second
boca
raton
case,
which
you'll
find
on
page
277
of
the
record,
face
this
problem
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
talked
about.
they
said
that
their
holding
in
sax
was
directly
contrary
to
cothron.
they
had
to
face
that
frankly.
and
they
overruled
cothron.
and
then,
after
the
second
problem,
they
said
that
you
had
a
duty
in
showing
that
you
represented
the
employees
to
show
it
to
the
employer
and
demonstrate
to
him
by
substantial
evidence
that
you
represented
the
employees.
now,
mind
you,
in
florida,
there
is
no
law
protecting
any
employee
against
a
discharge,
yet
his
name
is
given
to
the
employers.
now,
it
was
not
quite
clear
that
they
went
that
far.
they
said
you
must
show
that
they
represent
the
employees,
not
if
you
will
shift,
and
i
will
eliminate
some
of
the
other
developments
but
if
you
will
shift
down
to
the
versailles
case,
the
other
case
that
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
saxony
is
not.
i
do
not
believe
--
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
were
not.
but
the
different
chancellors
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
came
to
the
same
result
in
the
three
cases.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
if
you
go
to
versailles
to
complete
the
picture,
and
then,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
will
--
i
will
talk
about
some
of
the
illegal
issues.
if
you
go
to
versailles,
you
will
see
the
extent
to
which
this
union
then
went.
the
union
went
to
this
extent.
they
were
confronted
with
this
other
decision
which
said
you
must
demonstrate
to
the
employer
what
you
represent.
they
didn't
quite
know
what
it
meant.
but
they
went
to
the
employer
and
they
did
follow.
before
they
conducted
any
picketing,
they
went
to
the
employer
and
they
said
number
one,
we
would
like
a
secret
election.
number
two,
here
is
a
list
of
our
demands.
there
have
been
some
questions
of
whether
they
had
notice
of
the
demand.
they
gave
him
a
written
list
of
demand.
three,
these
are
all
set
forth,
the
--
the
notice
are
set
forth
in
310
of
the
record,
the
bargaining
demands
in
312.
they
then
said
to
the
employer,
“here
is
an
affidavit
from
a
certified
public
account,
which
certifies
that
he
has
examined
our
records
and
checking
them
against
the
list
of
hotel
employees.
we
represent
a
majority
of
accountants
certified
who
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
at
the
hotel.”
the
hotel
countered
by
saying
this,
“as
we
read
the
decision,
you
have
to
prove
this
to
our
satisfaction.”
they
said,
“here
is
the
cpa
affidavit.”
they
said,
“that
does
not
prove
our
satisfaction.
what
we
want
is
the
right
to
interrogate
these
employees.
in
your
presence
of
course,
but
interrogate.”
now,
mind
you,
in
the
first
four
case,
three
cases,
where
the
employees
had
gone
out
on
strike.
they're
all
had
been
replaced.
the
union
said
--
was
even
willing
to
go
this
far.
they
said,
“if
you
interrogate
the
employees,
would
you
recognize
the
union
for
those
employees
have
say
that
the
union
represents
them?”
under
the
law
of
florida,
there
is
no
majority
exclusive
representation
rule.
you
may
represent
the
union
for
your
members.
and
in
fact,
the
settlements
that
have
been
made
in
many
of
these
cases
that
are
not
here
were
for
members
only.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
versailles?
the
number
of
employees
was
59
out
of
75
employees,
59
designated
the
union
under
this
affidavit.
that
appears
on
record
297
and
record
323.
no,
record
313
and
record
323.
now,
the
employer
turned
down
that
offer
and
said
that
“we
will
only
deal
with
you
in
effect
that
you
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees.”
and
the
union
said,
“well,
we'll
make
you
another
offer,
even
though,
under
the
law
of
florida,
you
don't
have
to
recognize
what
we
can
deal
for
our
members.
we
will
go
to
a
secret
election
and
if
we
don't
have
the
majority,
we
won't
ask
for
representation.”
that
offer
was
denied.
there,
the
chancellor
affirmatively
found
and
denied
the
injunction
and
affirmatively
found
in
record
379
that
they
represented
the
majority
and
they
had
met
all
of
the
--
what
he
thought
was
a
supreme
court
standard
and
he
denied
the
injunction.
that
was
later
reversed
on
the
basis
of
short
opinion
without
discussion
on
the
basis
of
the
second
boca
raton
decision.
finally,
there's
one
other
case
which
i
want
to
mention
very
briefly
and
then
i
will
move
into
the
discussion.
san
marino,
the
chancellor
confronted
with
this
argument
to
who
represented
whom,
thought
in
the
exercise
of
his
equity
power
since
there
were
no
machinery
provided
in
the
florida
statute
for
elections.
he
denied
the
injunction
pending
a
secret
--
he
grabbed
the
injunction
pending
a
secret
election
by
a
commissioner
appointed
by
him.
the
hotels
promptly
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
and
another
one
of
its
opinion,
the
supreme
court
reversed
step
section
of
the
order
appointing
a
commissioner.
but
peculiarly
enough
that
--
in
effect
that
section
of
the
order
granting
an
injunction
until
an
election
was
conducted.
so
they
have
the
anomaly
of
an
injunctional
order
that
said
you
are
enjoined
from
picketing
until
an
election
is
conducted,
but
the
supreme
court
tore
down
that
part
of
the
order
which
said
there's
an
election
ought
to
be
conducted.
now,
finally,
in
the
final
chapter
in
this
unfortunate
saga,
there's
the
final
decision.
these
were
all
temporary
orders,
so
they
had
to
go
back.
stipulations
were
made
for
final
orders
and
there
were
all
injunctions
then.
some
of
the
injunctions
were
not
as
broad
as
the
injunction
i
read
to
you,
some
only
restrained
picketing.
a
number
of
them
restrained
picketing
and
publication.
finally,
it
went
back.
and
all
the
cases
were
pending
in
the
supreme
court,
but
the
supreme
court
did
not
decide
those
cases
directly,
but
they
decided
the
fontainebleau
which
is
a
separate
case.
and
in
that
case
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
fontainebleau,
they
found
some
violence.
and
by
the
way
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
were
some
cases
were
there
was
evidence
of
violence
and
the
trial
court
found
violence
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
we
--
we
did
not
seek
to
review
this
finding
of
the
trial
court.
casablanca
was
one,
sea
isle
or
empress.
those
cases,
we
did
not
take
up.
we
eliminate
it
because
we
did
not
want
to
get
in
an
argument
about
a
finding.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they're
not
before
you.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
fontainebleau
was
not
before
you.
but
fontainebleau
is
before
you
as
a
statement
of
loss
in
three
cases
were
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
fontainebleau.
and
i
want
to
read
you
one
paragraph
in
the
fontainebleau
decision.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
am
reading
from
page
50
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
sets
out
fontainebleau.
now
--
and
then
it's
in
the
first
paragraph.
and
they
talked
about
picketing,
and
i'll
read
--
no,
they
talked
about
the
right
to
strike
and
then
they
go
on
and
say,
“those
sets
requirement,
this
is
as
to
a
majority
vote
about
the
strike
provision,”
which
i
refer
to
later,
which
clearly
couldn't
apply
to
an
industry
in
commerce
under
the
o'brien
decision
of
this
court.
but
passing
that,
because
that
is
not
involved
here.
here
is
the
reference
to
picketing,
“it
cannot
be
initiated
however
for
spite
or
for
reasons
other
than
to
accomplish
a
lawful
purpose
and
then
the
law
order
and
decently
required
that
it
will
be
done
in
an
atmosphere
conducive
to
reaching
a
result
that
is
fair
to
the
employer,
the
employees
and
the
public.
if
attempted
in
an
atmosphere
of
violence,
insinuation,
bad
fate,
deception,
force
or
"damned
if
i
don't
show
you”
spirit,
they
would
not
be
recognized
as
a
means
of
adjusting
labor
disputes.”
now,
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
since
these
cases
were
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
fontainebleau
and
since
violence
is
not
present
in
any
of
these
cases,
and
on
the
fact
in
four
of
them,
there
is
an
expressed
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
itself
of
florida
that
no
violence
is
present.
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
i
read
anything
under
the
law
of
florida,
florida
is
now
saying
that
picketing
conducted
in
a
“damned
if
i
don't
show
you”
spirit
is
--
can
enjoined
and
has
no
constitutional
protection.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
know
what
it
means
either.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
not
taking
it
out
of
context.
i've
read
the
paragraph
as
it
stands.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
is
part
of
a
collocation.
but
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
some
sign
must
eliminate
the
violence,
the
other
part
applies,
i
think
it
reflects
a
decision
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
that
applies.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
is
not
and
it
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
should
not
be
than
that.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
i
will
now
turn
to
the
--
to
a
brief
(inaudible).
i
like
to
reserve
a
little
time
in
rebuttal
for
my
colleague,
mr.
feller.
we
now
turn
to
the
questions
presented.
on
this
record,
the
questions
presented,
it
seems
to
me,
are
whether
the
state,
in
this
case
florida,
consistently
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
may
prohibit
picketing
by
union
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
achieve
union
recognition
and
collective
bargaining.
and
in
an
industry
this
case,
the
hotel
industry,
where
the
objective
sought
to
be
achieved
by
the
picket
is
not
unlawful
or
contrary
to
any
policy
in
the
state.
the
picket
signs
are
truthful
and
the
picketing
is
peaceful.
and
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
decision
of
the
court
do
not,
in
their
various
treatments
of
the
subject,
even
suggest
that
picketing
has
communication
that
maybe
more
than
communication.
but
the
picketing
i
described
was
communications
picketing
that
they
were
seeking
to
an
election
or
seeking
collective
bargaining
can
be
constitutionally
restrained.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
exact
--
i
can
give
you
that.
i
marked
it
on
my
chart.
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
all
right.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
injunction
in
saxony
is
at
record
3132.
it
was
made
permanent
by
record
53.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
it
was
not.
the
injunction
in
--
and
that's
what
i
call
a
broad
injunction,
the
--
which
i
read,
against
publication
to
the
record.
and
sans
souci
is
on
page
98
and
was
made
final
at
291.
the
record
in
sherry
frontenac
was
--
that
was
also
a
broad
injunction.
the
record
in
sherry
frontenac
was
543
and
was
made
permanent
in
570.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
570,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
record
in
lombardy
was
646
and
was
made
permanent
in
654.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
these
are
all
--
the
saxony,
sans
souci
and
sherry
frontenac
are
broad
injunctions.
the
record
--
the
injunction
in
lombardy
was
just
narrow
injunction.
it's
just
against
picketing
not
against
publication.
the
miami
colonial,
666
was
a
temporary
restraining
order.
it
was
made
permanent
797.
and
that's
a
narrow
injunction.
the
record
in
the
(inaudible)
815
made
permanent
821.
and
that
is
a
narrow
injunction.
the
--
the
del
monico
was
844
and
is
873.
and
that
was
a
narrow
injunction.
the
record
in
881
--
president
madison
is
881
and
was
made
final
in
903.
the
record
in
the
injunction
in
robert
richter
was
994.
and
that
became
a
broad
one
again,
although
subsequent
in
time.
and
it
was
made
final
in
1001.
the
(inaudible)
the
preliminary
injunction
was
1080
and
became
final
in
1085.
and
that
was
a
broad
injunction.
the
record
in
versailles,
the
--
the
injunction
was
391.
and
i
call
that
a
limited
broad
injunction
because
that
is
the
same
as
the
broad
injunction
and
enjoined
from
publishing
refusal
to
negotiate
but
not
from
stating
that
a
strike
was
going
on.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
was
no
strike
going
on
in
versailles.
they
didn't
call
their
people
out.
they
just
put
picket
sign
because
at
that
point,
they
--
they
--
when
they
call
people
out
on
strike
they
were
replaced.
and
by
the
way,
and
--
when
that
took
place
they
told
their
people
to
go
in.
we
don't
have
any
aspects
of
suppliers,
other
people.
they
told
their
people
to
go
in
and
protect
their
jobs.
and
they
were
appealing
to
the
public.
and
this
is
the
key
to
this
whole
dispute.
the
appeals
that
were
made
were
made
to
the
public.
there
were
communications.
it
was
not
in
a
flag
or
a
signal.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
i
will.
in
the
last
quarters
are
--
as
indicated
in
the
chart.
i
will
take
just
few
more
minutes.
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
this
violates
the
constitutional
protection
of
free
speech.
as
i
also
read
the
decisions
of
the
court,
this
violates
the
--
the
doctrine
which
is
established
in
guss
that
commerce
here
being
present
that
the
--
the
case
was
preempted.
and
my
opinion
was
adequately
erased
by
the
--
by
the
parties.
it
is
clearly
a
guss
case
even
more
a
guss
case
than
guss
itself.

we
don't
have
to
go
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
don't
have
to
go
back
because
it
was
rejected
not
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
improper
offer
of
proof
but
--
but
reject
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
immaterial.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
objection
was
made
that
it
was
immaterial
and
irrelevant
to
the
issues
of
the
case.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
