mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
the
government
will
start
out
this
argument
today
by
addressing
itself
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
whittaker.
needless
to
say,
we
have
had
some
difficulty
with
clarifying
the
sentence
imposed
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case
ourselves.
as
this
has
been
indicated,
the
sentence
was
imposed
upon
three
counts
to
run
consecutively.
and
upon
the
12
remaining
counts,
the
sentence
was
imposed
to
run
concurrently
and
concurrently
with
the
sentences
imposed
upon
--
the
sentence
under
counts
2,
4
and
7,
the
consecutive
counts.
now,
the
difficulty
i
think
arises
because
there
is
a
conflict
between
what
the
judge
said
at
the
time
that
he
imposed
sentence
orally
and
with
what
is
contained
in
the
formal
judgment
and
commitment
that
he
signed.
we
set
--
the
formal
judgment
and
commitment
is
set
forth
at
page
124
of
the
record.
and
it
indicates
that
the
judge
imposed
consecutive
times
of
five
years
insofar
as
we
are
concerned
with
them,
the
maximum
on
counts
2,
4
and
7
and
upon
counts
--
well,
the
remaining
counts
five
year
terms
to
run
concurrently
and
he
said
by
the
counts,
top
of
page
125,
and
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentences
imposed
on
counts
2,
4
and
7.
now,
coming
down
to
the
bottom
of
page
125,
we
have
the
judge's
oral
sentence
and
he
says,
“william
greene,
it
is
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
on
counts
2,
4,
7,
you'd
be
imprisoned
in
an
institution
to
be
designated
by
the
attorney
general
for
a
term
of
not
less
than
20
months
and
not
more
than
five
years,
and
that
you'd
be
fined
$500,
the
sentences
to
run
consecutively.
that
on
each
of
the
other
counts
in
the
indictment,
you'd
be
imprisoned
for
a
term
of
20
months
to
five
years
and
to
be
fined
$500,
the
sentences
on
the
other
counts
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentences
on
counts
2,
4
and
7.”
but
he
didn't
stop
there,
he
went
on
and
he
said,
“in
other
words,
the
aggregate
sentence
is
not
less
than
five
years
and
not
more
than
15
years.”
we
believe
that
that
evinces
a
clear
intent
of
the
sentencingjudge
to
impose
an
aggregate,
a
gross
or
general
sentence
of
15
years
upon
the
concurrent
counts.
and
if
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
what
he
said
at
the
time
he
actually
imposed
sentence
and
what
was
said
in
the
judgment
and
commitment
that
was
signed,
we
think
it
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
what
he
said
orally
because
that
would
seem
to
express
his
true
intention.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
unless
this
court
can
agree
that
the
sentences
imposed
on
the
12
counts
to
run
concurrently
with
the
consecutive
counts,
is
a
gross
sentence.
we
feel
that
the
sentence
will
have
to
go
--
the
case
will
have
to
go
back
at
least
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
court
to
consider
the
validity
of
counts
2,
4
and
7
which
it
did
not
do
when
the
--
when
the
case
first
came
to
it.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
of
course
his
language
in
other
words,
the
aggregate
sentence
is
not
less
than
5,
no
more
than
15
years
is
significant
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
of
course,
the
--
the
sentence
was
actually
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
implicitly
when
it
applied
the
clawson
rule
to
support
the
sentence.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
other
cases
since
clawson,
there
have
been
instances
where
particular
counts
were
picked
out
of
the
sentence
and
made
to
run
concurrently
with
other
particular
counts.
as
recently
as
the
lawn
case
cited
in
our
brief,
that
was
done.
i
think
the
opinions
by
yourself
mr.
justice
is
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
believe
that
to
be
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
not
precisely
what
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
clawson
case
holds
but
we
think
that
that
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
think
that
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
clawson
rule.
the
clawson
case
did
not
quite
go
that
far.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
frankly
am
not
sufficient
with
it
--
familiar
with
what
the
custody
authorities
are
required
to
do.
i
would
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
would
think
so.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
think
that
--
we
think
that
the
formal
judgment
and
commitment
can
be
corrected
to
conform
with
the
sentence
actually
imposed
and
indeed
that
has
been
done
in
several
cases.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
judgment,
i
think
it
can
be
clarified
by
resort
to
the
--
to
the
oral
sentence
or
to
the
record.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
construed
this
sentence
as
a
gross
sentence.
otherwise
we
don't
think
that
it
could
have
applied
the
clawson
rule
and
thus,
avoided
the
case
on
its
merits
really.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
--
we
have
difficulty
with
this
sentence,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
now,
upon
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
difficulty,
your
honor,
not
doubt.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
were
able
to
resolve
our
own
difficulties
in
the
light
of
the
judge's
oral
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
statement
that
the
aggregate
sentence
is
15
years
and
also
in
deference
to
the
construction
of
the
sentence
as
placed
upon
it
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
might
say
at
this
that
this
sentence
was
imposed
under
a
district
of
columbia
statute,
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
is
the
highest
court
in
the
district
and
its
--
its
construction
of
the
statute
is
entitled
i
think
to
a
considerable
weight.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
this
is
--
this
sentence
was
imposed
upon
--
under
the
district
of
columbia
indeterminate
sentence
law.
there
--
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
minimums
and
maximums
imposed
in
any
other
district.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
is
the
violation
of
the
federal
law.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
have
--
questions
arise
in
many
cases
which
come
up
to
the
appellate
courts
and
the
appellate
court's
opinions
in
those
cases
we
think
are
entitled
to
be
considered
and
they
are
authoritative.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
by
application
of
the
clawson
rule,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
even
if
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
it
was
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
record.
even
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
bazelon
seem
to
agree
that
this
was
a
general
sentence
and
his
only
difficulty
with
the
case
was
on
the
merits
of
the
gore
principle.
now,
assuming
that
the
court
can
accept
the
proposition
that
the
clawson
rule
was
properly
applied
here,
that
will
raise
the
question
of
whether
a
court
can
sentence
for
a
single
narcotics
transaction
a
defendant
to
multiple
punishment.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
he
did.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
therefore,
on
the
basis
that
the
clawson
rule
was
properly
applied
here
and
by
a
process
of
mathematical
elimination
of
the
counts
which
the
dissenting
judge
regarded
as
invalid
and
of
course
we
don't
concede
that
they
were
invalid
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
can
assume
that
even
the
dissenting
judge
was
correct
in
his
assumption.
we
can
say
that
the
sentence
can
be
supported.
and
of
course
this
squarely
raises
the
question
of
whether
gore
was
correctly
decided.
the
gore
question
comes
into
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
for
a
single
sale,
namely
on
january
21,
1955,
the
defendant
was
charged
in
counts
4,
5,
and
6
with
violations
of
three
separate
statutes.
and
three
punishments
were
in
fact
imposed
upon
those
three
counts.
now,
again,
count
4
out
of
that
group
was
the
only
one
upon
which
consecutive
terms
were
imposed.
but
going
over
to
the
clawson
situation,
we
would
have
to
pick
out
five
counts
or
at
least
three
to
support
a
15
years
--
a
sentence
of
15
years
from
the
group
to
groups
4,
5
and
6
and
10,
11
and
12.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
was
done
as
i
say
in
the
formal
commitment
and
there
is
obviously
some
discrepancy
between
what
was
said
in
the
formal
of
commitment
and
what
was
said
in
the
oral
sentence.
and
when
he
sentenced
the
defendant
orally,
he
did
not
say
that
the
sentences
on
the
concurrent
counts
would
--
counts
which
will
run
concurrently
with
each
other.
he
said
only
concurrently
with
2,
4
and
7.
now,
i
take
it
that
his
intention
at
that
time
was
to
permit
anyone
or
all
of
the
counts
on
the
12
--
the
any
one
of
the
sentences
imposed
on
any
one
of
the
12
concurrent
counts
to
run
concurrently
with
anyone
or
all
of
the
consecutive
targets.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
five
years.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
that's
all.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
that
is
the
construction
of
the
sentence,
then
certainly,
this
case
will
have
to
go
back
to
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
from
the
oral
sentence.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
--
i
get
it
from
the
oral
sentence
because
of
what
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
when
he
sentenced
orally,
he
did
not
say
that
the
counts
were
to
run
concurrently
with
each
other.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
with
two,
four
and
seven.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
if
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
some
of
the
counts
are
to
run
concurrently
with
2,
4
and
7,
it
would
seem
that
you
could
select
any
three
good
counts
and
make
them
run
concurrently
with
2,
4
and
7
respectively.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
they
weren't
considered,
they're
good
counts,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
set
this
explanation
now
to
footnote
8
of
--
of
page
21
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
did.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
page
21,
footnote
8.
we
say
if
the
sentence
could
not
be
considered
as
a
gross
sentence,
at
least
as
to
the
12
counts
which
were
to
be
concurrent
with
2,
4
and
7,
we
believe
that
the
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
counts
2,
4
and
7.
if
it
found
any
one
of
them
invalid,
that
court
would
then
have
to
remand
to
the
district
court
for
resentencing,
since
assuming
that
the
other
counts
cannot
be
considered
in
gross,
in
other
words
as
a
general
sentence,
it
is
not
clear
which
of
them,
taken
individually,
what
to
be
concurrent
with
two,
which
with
four
and
which
with
seven.
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
the
court
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
abandonment
of
the
clawson
rule
because
the
concurrent
terms
are
to
run
concurrently
with
the
consecutive
terms.
if
any
of
the
consecutive
terms
are
bad,
i
think
the
concurrent
terms
would
have
to
step
up
in
line.
in
other
words
if
we
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
found
count
7
in
the
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
found
count
7
invalid
upon
a
remand.
and
personally,
i
have
difficulty
with
that
count.
if
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
that
count
7
was
invalid,
then
i
think
we
would
have
left
only
a
ten
year
sentence
because
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
concurrent
counts
can
only
concurrently
with
valid
counts.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
but
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
on
the
assumption
that
the
clawson
rule
should
be
disregarded
in
this
case
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
if
it
is
determined
that
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
bad
counts
supporting
sentence,
even
though
there
are
sufficiently
large
number
of
counts
to
support
the
aggregate
sentence,
then
i
would
say
yes,
the
purpose
in
remanding
to
the
district
judge
would
be
to
permit
him
to
reconsider
his
sentence.
but
our
purpose
in
suggesting
that
this
court
might
wish
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
were
unable
to
conclude
from
the
manner
in
which
the
judge
sentenced
the
defendant
that
he
intended
a
gross
sentence
on
the
12
concurrent
counts
is
to
permit
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
validity
of
the
consecutive
counts
which
it
must
do
and
it
hasn't
done
if
you
are
unable
to
find
three
other
good
counts
which
constitute
a
gross
sentence
of
15
years.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
would
depend
on
which
three
they
found
bad.
if
they
found
the
three
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
they
found
them
bad?
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
everything
else
good?
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
then,
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
construed
the
concurrent
counts
as
adding
up
to
a
total
of
only
five
years
as
does
mr.
justice
whittaker,
it
would
have
to
go
back
--
well,
it
need
not
go
back.
in
that
situation,
the
court
of
appeals
could
reduce
the
sentence
to
five
years
i
presume
or
it
could
remand
to
the
sentencing
judge
to
enter
a
judgment
in
conformity
with
that
opinion
which
--
under
which
he
would
be
entitled
to
impose
only
a
five-year
sentence.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
murphy,
are
--
are
your
difficulties
as
expressed
in
this
footnote
8,
such
as
to
cause
you
to
suggest
this
kind
of
the
disposition
of
this
cas?
mr.
john
l.
murphy
not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
defer
to
the
court
of
appeals'
construction
of
this
sentence
as
imposing
a
general
sentence
of
15
years
upon
the
12
concurrent
counts.
and
if
that's
true
then
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
to
this
problem
was
correct.
and
of
course,
this
raises
then
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
was
properly
sentenced
to
consecutive
terms
--
i'm
sorry,
to
multiple
punishment
on
several
counts
involving
violations
of
several
different
statutes
penalizing
and
prohibiting
traffic
in
narcotics.
now,
the
--
to
get
back
to
the
facts,
the
--
there
was
a
sale
of
narcotics
made
by
the
petitioner's
accomplice
on
january
21.
counts
4,
5
and
6
were
charged
for
that
violation.
they
involved
violations
of
section
174,
of
title
21,
the
export
import
drug
act,
section
4704,
of
title
26,
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
the
stamp
provision,
person
cannot
deal
in
narcotic
drugs
expect
in
or
from
the
stamped
package.
and
the
count
--
the
third
count
of
that
group
charge
the
violation
of
the
order
from
the
provision
of
section
4705.
now,
petitioner
contends
that
gore,
though
it
decided
this
identical
question,
should
be
reconsidered.
and
as
i
understand
the
basis
for
his
contention,
it
is
that
multiple
punishment,
cannot
be
imposed
upon
violations
of
three
different
statutes
where
the
violation
arose
out
of
a
single
transaction,
or
stated
another
way
that
the
rule
upon
which
we
distinguish
between
different
crimes
is
one
which
has
to
do
with
whether
the
evidence
is
the
same
to
support
each
of
the
charges.
we
contend
that
the
rule
is
not
as
petitioner
would
have
it.
in
fact,
if
it
were,
it
would
seem
to
lead
to
rather
incongruous
results.
the
rule
as
i
think
it
is
--
as
it
exists
and
as
it
should
be
correctly
stated
is
that
two
offenses
are
different.
if
the
statutes
against
which
they
offend
contain
different
elements,
one
statute
defines
a
crime
different
from
another
if
it
has
within
its
definition
a
legal
element
different
from
the
elements
contained
in
the
other
statute.
in
other
words,
if
statute
a
says
in
order
to
have
a
conviction
under
this
statute,
you
must
prove
a
and
b
and
the
other
statute
says
you
must
prove
a,
b
and
c.
we
say
that
those
are
different
statutes,
they
are
different
offenses.
and
whether
you
proceed
on
the
basis
of
statutory
construction
or
upon
the
constitutional
question
which
petitioner
admits
that
he
does
not
press
in
this
case,
we
think
that
the
rule
should
be
the
same.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
the
statutes
against
which
the
same
evidence
--
offense
contain
different
elements,
as
they
do
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
in
this
case,
that
is
not
so,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
in
a
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
in
a
particular
case,
the
--
the
same
evidence
to
a
certain
degree
will
be
used
to
support
the
different
charges.
let
me
explain.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
in
this
particular
setting
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
that
is
our
position.
that
is
the
definitions
of
the
crimes
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
even
though
the
evidence
may
be
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
identical.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
don't
reach
that
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe
because
under
the
provisions
of
the
various
narcotics
statutes,
different
evidence
is
in
fact
required
even
though
we
may
rely
upon
the
presumptions.
this
question
as
mr.
heller
indicated
is
--
is
more
explicitly
presented
in
the
case
to
follow.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
has
raised
it
here,
we
should
touch
upon
it.
under
section
174,
petitioner
maybe
convicted
solely
upon
proof
that
he
possessed
a
narcotic
drug
if
he
does
not
explain
his
possession.
under
section
4704
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
he
may
be
convicted
if
he
is
found
in
possession
of
a
drug
and
the
government
proves
that
in
addition
to
possession
that
there
were
no
tax
stamps
on
that
drug.
so
there,
we
have
two
different
facts
to
support
two
different
crimes.
of
course,
the
third
statute
is
entirely
distinct,
no
presumption
can
be
relied
upon
there,
actual
proof
of
the
sale
and
the
absence
of
the
order
form
must
be
proved.
if
the
rule
were
as
petitioner
contends
that
offenses
are
identical,
if
the
same
evidence
could
be
used
to
support
each
of
them,
i
think
that
the
rule
would
lead
to
incongruous
results
as
is
demonstrated
by
petitioner's
rather
startling
contention
with
respect
to
the
aider
and
abettor
rule
here.
he
contends
that
since
the
petitioner
did
not
himself
sell
the
drug,
but
used
an
accomplice
since
he
did
not
on
some
occasions,
transport
the
drug,
but
used
an
accomplice
since
he
didn't
do
any
of
those
things,
but
merely
in
some
way
as
deny
in
the
instant
case,
says,
associated
himself
with
her
activities
and
demonstrated
his
wish
to
see
them
succeed,
this
constitutes
a
single
piece
of
evidence
and
he
couldn't
be
convicted
of
more
than
one
offense.
he
doesn't
indicate
which
offense
he
would
be
guilty
of,
but
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
more
than
one
offense
even
though
she
could
be
convicted
of
several.
of
course,
this
is
a
rather
startling
observation,
however,
it
is
not
unusual
among
the
people
in
the
narcotics
trade
who
more
and
more
these
days
put
as
we
said
in
the
vernacular
of
the
trade
or
in
the
record
in
this
case,
put
other
people
out
front
so
that
they
cannot
be
detected.
they
cannot
be
shown
to
had
had
possession.
they
feel
secure
in
the
fact
that
they
are
not
handling
the
drugs
themselves.
they
are
aware
of
these
presumptions
stemming
from
possession.
so
they
tried
to
put
other
people
out
front
to
do
the
actual
transactions.
now,
this
same
issue
of
whether
a
single
fact
could
support
multiple
charges
was
raised
in
the
gore
case,
and
all
the
arguments
that
were
raised
there
was
set
at
rest
seemingly
and
this
curt
went
back
to
blockburger
in
which
the
identical
question
was
raised,
back
in
1932
i
believe
it
was.
and
blockburger
has
decided
that
these
offenses
were
distinct
even
though
the
transaction
which
was
involved
in
the
offense
consisted
of
a
single
one,
and
we
see
no
occasion
for
this
court
to
reconsider
the
merits
of
the
question
involved
in
the
gore
decision.
indeed,
petitioner
here,
since
the
acts
of
his
accomplice
were
his
acts,
did
in
fact
commit
many
different
acts
and
we
did
not.
the
government
did
not
rely
in
any
manner
or
means
upon
the
presumption
arising
out
of
possession
of
the
drug.
the
government
proved
that
he
committed
acts
by
associating
himself
with
an
accomplice
who
did
the
acts,
so
that
her
acts
were
his.
now,
some
question
has
been
raised
with
regard
to
the
bell,
prince,
(inaudible)
cases,
we
feel
that
those
cases
are
distinguishable
from
the
present
one,
the
legislative
histories
in
those
cases,
in
this
--
the
legislative
histories
of
the
statutes
in
those
cases
as
well
as
the
statutes
themselves
were
held
to
clearly
evince
an
attitude
upon
the
part
of
congress
to
impose
only
a
single
punishment
or
if
there
was
ambiguity
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
would
be
applied
to
impose
the
less
severe
punishment.
that
is
the
statutory
rule,
government
does
not
disagree
with
it,
we
say
however
that
it
cannot
be
applied
in
this
case
in
view
of
the
clear
indication
on
the
part
of
congress
down
through
the
years
to
impose
more
and
more
severe
sentences
upon
narcotics
violators.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
adverted
to
a
recent
statute
enacted
by
congress
which
was
specifically
accepted
from
application
in
narcotics
crimes.
that
statute
i
believe,
permits
the
judge
in
sentencing
a
violator
for
a
single
crime
to
divide
the
sentence
up
into
partly
imprisonment
and
partly
probation.
and
unless
congress
--
congress
left
the
--
the
approach
might
be
made
that
this
statute
would
apply
to
permit
probation
for
a
narcotics
violator
who
had
violated
one
of
the
statutes
which
today
precludes
probation
or
even
parole,
congress
was
alert
to
the
possibility
that
that
might
be
done.
very
explicitly
said
that
this
statute
shall
not
apply
to
any
narcotics
violator
under
a
statute
which
precludes
probation.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
counts
three
and
five
of
--
of
the
blockburger
case
involved
a
single
sale
of
narcotics.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
that
the
charges
in
the
blockburger
case
were
under
4704
which
has
a
presumptive
provision
in
it
and
4705,
each
of
title
26
which
does
not
have
a
presumptive
provision
in
it.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
in
the
tort
case,
it
was
merely
decided
that
the
presumption
arising
from
the
fact
proved
was
not
logically
related
to
the
fact
presumed.
now,
that
contention
has
been
set
at
rest
in
the
narcotics
statutes
time
and
time
again
in
yee
ham
and
casey,
doremus,
many
times
that
question
has
been
raised
and
that
this
court
has
decided
that
the
presumptions
here,
the
fact
proved
this
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
presumption
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
the
presumption
can
take
the
place
of
proof
of
one
of
the
elements.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
there
we
get
into
the
problem,
mr.
justice
black,
unless
there
are
included
offenses
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
which
--
which
under
which
congress
can
--
can
proscribe
a
particular
activity
and
it
can
penalize
any
of
the
subordinate
actions
necessary
to
commit
that
activity.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
it
can
and
--
and
in
fact,
the
albrecht
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
i
--
i
believe
that
could
constitutional
be
done.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
in
--
in
the
albrecht
case
which
is
reported
at
273
u.s.
page
1,
the
question
was
whether
a
man
could
be
convicted
for
selling
liquor
and
possessing
the
same
liquor.
and
this
court
said
that
it
could
be
done
and
it
--
it
allowed
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
it
was
proved
that
he
sold
it.
but
if
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
that
was
the
reasoning
applied
by
the
court,
but
of
course,
the
same
question
is
involved
here
where
you
have
possession
of
heroin.
heroin
can't
be
stamped.
and
if
you
posses
it,
you
possess
a
narcotic
drug
and
you
also
posses
a
drug
that
which
doesn't
have
stamps
on
it.
we
say
that
that
is
different
fact.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
the
only
question
that
arise
is
how
can
you
prove
the
elements
of
the
offense.
and
congress
had
said
that
you
can
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
congress
had
said
that
you
can
prove
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
these
cases
by
proof
of
possession.
and
the
presumption
takes
over
and
supplies
the
missing
proof.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes
it
would
be
an
insurmountable
burden.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
think
the
same
rules
apply
in
--
in
the
narcotics
field
to
those
involved
even
in
non-statutory
presumptions.
proceeding
then
to
the
question
of
whether
the
clawson
rule
should
be
reconsidered
on
its
merits.
we
feel
that
the
clawson
rule
serves
a
very
salutary
purpose.
it
conserves
the
energies
of
the
appellate
courts,
it
--
it
prevents
a
--
an
appellant
from
raising
issues
which
cannot
afford
him
any
relief
or
at
least
it
--
it
enables
the
appellate
courts
to
decide
cases
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
affirm
a
sentence
imposed
upon
a
defendant
without
taking
the
time
and
effort
to
review
the
evidence
to
support
counts
which
might
be
bad
but
which
might
not
be,
but
which
in
any
event
could
not
afford
the
petitioner
any
relief
on
the
assumption
that
the
sentencing
judge
would
not
impose
a
different
sentence
if
they
were
sufficient,
a
sufficient
number
of
counts
to
support
the
sentence
he
had
already
imposed.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
is
rather
artificial,
mr.
justice
black,
but
it
is
a
rule
that
has
been
consistently
applied
both
in
this
court
and
the
lower
courts.
it's,
as
we
indicate
our
brief,
necessitated
by
a
rule
of
judicial
parsimony.
and
on
that
basis,
i
think
it
--
it
serves
a
salutary
purpose.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
not
that
there
were
15
counts
against
him,
mr.
chief
justice
but
the
quantities
of
narcotics
in
which
he
dealt
were
substantial.
and
there
were
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
believe
it's
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
this
is
a
narcotics
offense
of
an
exceedingly
aggravated
character
because
apparently,
this
defendant
has
been
dealing
in
narcotics
in
large
quantities
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
some
of
the
counts
involve
quantities
as
large
as
40
capsules.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there
are
15
counts
in
this
indictment.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
there
again,
it's
not
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
would
have
to
conceive
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
but
even
more
did
he
consider
the
character
of
the
man
i
think,
what
he
was
engaged
in
over
a
long
period
of
time,
how
he
used
this
innocent
girl.
incidentally,
she
was
a
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
when
a
judge
sentences
the
defendant
i
would
assume
that
he
doesn't
do
so
solely
upon
the
legality
of
the
several
counts,
he
considers
the
--
the
defendant's
whole
character.
he
considers
how
he
got
into
the
business,
and
all
of
these
different
elements.
in
--
in
other
words,
as
we
say,
he
considers
the
offense
but
even
more
the
offender.
and
i
can't
say
that
a
judge
in
any
particular
case
would
give
very
great
weight
to
the
number
of
counts
in
the
indictment
because
he
is
aware
that
the
united
states
attorney
can
charge
a
defendant
in
one
case
in
a
number
of
counts
for
the
same
offense
which
he
charges
another
defendant
with
only
a
few.
so
that,
the
number
of
counts
in
an
indictment
in
my
opinion
is
not
really
significant.
i
do
take
notice
of
the
fact
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out
that
--
that
the
judge
in
this
case
did
make
special
mention
that
there
were
15
counts,
but
i
think
he
was
talking
about
that
in
reference
to
the
duration
of
the
crime
as
possibly
evidencing
the
fact
that
this
was
a
crime
committed
over
a
period
of
time
and
that
there
were
numerous
transactions
involved,
which
concededly
there
were.
so
that,
even
if
the
--
the
counts
--
the
counts
laid
on
the
single
transaction
of
the
multiple
counts,
if
we
only
--
if
we
assume
that
there
were
--
that
he
should
have
been
sentenced
to
only
under
one
statute
for
each
transaction,
he
still
engaged
in
six
transactions
plus
a
conspiracy.
i
think
that
the
sentencing
--
sentencing
judge
had
that
in
mind
as
well
as
the
number
of
counts
in
this
indictment.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
in
any
event,
the
rule
is
not
in
(inaudible),
it
can
be
disregarded
by
an
appellate
court
if
it
feels
in
a
particular
case,
that
the
case
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
is
discretionary.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
an
appellate
court
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
look
at
the
sentence.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
there
was
a
special
circumstance.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it's
an
analogous
situation.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
your
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
assumes
that
the
12
concurrent
counts
were
actually
made
to
run
concurrently
with
each
other.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
that
--
if
that
assumption
is
correct,
then
i
can
get
no
more
than
five
years
out
of
those
concurrent
counts
and
the
consecutive
counts
would
have
to
be
valid
to
support
a
15-year
sentence,
all
of
them.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
they
haven't.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
let
me
say
they
wouldn't
even
have
to
consider
the
clawson
rule
if
they
found
all
of
the
consecutive
counts
good.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
if
they
found
one
of
them
bad,
then
they
would
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
sentencing
judge
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
for
clarification
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
if
you
will
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
as
to
which
of
the
concurrent
counts
he
wished
to
run
concurrently
with
which
of
the
consecutive
counts.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
sufficient
ambiguity,
i
--
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
the
correct
determination
to
make.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
think
it
should
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
first
to
determine.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
they
have
--
they
have
impliedly
said
that
counts
4,
5
and
6
and
10,
11,
12
are
good.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
--
but
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
five
other
than
the
consecutive
counts.
but
you
see
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
--
yes.
there
are
at
least
five.
actually
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
actually,
the
--
the
dissenting
judge
impliedly
conceded
that
there
were
six
good
counts,
4,
5
and
6,
10,
11
and
12,
but
the
way
the
--
the
majority
expressed
it
was
that
they
said
in
order
to
apply
the
clawson
rule,
that
there
are
at
least
five
other
counts
in
addition
or
exclusive
of
the
consecutive
counts.
and
there
was
--
those
--
at
least
five
of
them
are
good
and
they
will
support
at
least
a
15-year
sentence,
so
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
consider
the
validity
of
the
consecutive
counts
themselves.
i
think
that
sufficiently
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
demonstrates
the
government's
pleas.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
you
see,
they
didn't
use
the
language
of
the
formal
judgment
and
commitment
there.
they
went
back
to
the
oral
sentence
as
the
proper
sentence
to
be
construed
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
think
that's
the
only
way
that
you
can
arrive
at
the
five
counts,
you
see
the
--
it's
--
it's
rather
an
involved
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
the
five
are
--
5
and
6,
and
10,
11
and
12.
none
of
which
are
among
the
consecutive
counts.
