justice
felix
frankfurter
the
sales
was
separate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
cite
it?
was
the
case
cited?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
want
us
to
assume
the
contrary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
so
different
--
they're
very
different
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
then
i
have
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
with
your
general
attitudes
towards
the
prosecution
or
multiplication
nobody
could
add
more
sympathy
my
sympathy
(inaudible)
speaking
that
it's
the
business
of
the
court
to
see
to
it
the
district
attorneys
exercise
gentlemanly
restraint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
doing
in
that
case
is
what
mr.
justice
holmes
called,
trying
to
break
the
faggot
up
into
sticks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
--
namely
you
had
one
statute,
the
congressional
power
was
the
question
of
transportation
and
then
the
doctrine
of
lenity
can
be
properly
and
nobody
believes
it
as
more
than
i
do.
but
when
you
have
three
statutes,
that
the
history
and
the
constant
increase
in
punishment
to
assume
that
congress
is
going
to
be
increasingly
tender,
what
is
the
phrase
that
you
saw
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
hasn't
been
yet
been
suggested
that
the
mann
act
should
be
followed
by
capital
punishment
and
we
have
had
bills
and
for
all
i
know
they're
under
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
know
better
than
i
do,
how
far
has
congress
gone
in
the
last
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
call
your
attention,
mr.
heller,
to
the
argument,
was
it
on
a
statute
that
was
passed
with
the
last
congress,
the
youth
probation
act
or
something
in
which
they
took
great
care
to
accept,
a
lot
of
speeches
by
congressman,
great
care,
was
afforded
the
youth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
great
care
was
taken
by
various
members
in
both
houses
to
see
it
shouldn't
apply
to
narcotics
case.
the
whole
history
of
narcotic
legislation
must
be
taken
into
account
and
not
consider
this
problem
as
an
abstract
problem
the
way
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you've
reached
by
your
argument
persuades
from
an
argument
to
this
court
to
join
others
and
become
a
majority
in
overruling
bell,
you
might
accomplish
that
by
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
--
may
i
suggest
the
difference
in
contempt
cases,
where
the
court
has
control
over
sentences
as
against
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
that
doesn't
answer
your
argument
against
the
rule.
i
merely
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
--
or
have
i
overlooked,
judge
bazelon
doesn't
so
much
as
refer
to
the
passing
case
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
just
--
doesn't
exist
for
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
footnote
relates
to
some
other
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
(inaudible)
i
mean
i
don't
know
what
--
(inaudible)
lawyers
and
judges
whenever
we
want
to
throw
in
something,
we
say
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
had
a
--
we
had
a
later
days
where
clawson
was
the
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
there
is
a
pinkerton
case
which
i
dissented
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
press
too
heavily
on
lord
denman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they're
all
--
the
big
lawyers
of
the
day
were
all
against
him,
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
they
were
called
in
and
asked
to
give
their
opinion,
the
judges
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
estimable
man
but
not
one
the
greatest
of
english
lawyers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
as
i
understand
the
clawson
rule,
it
is
that
if
the
appellate
court
find
that
the
total,
the
aggregate
of
the
sentence
can
be
attributed
to
valid
counts
and
valid
proof
under
those
counts
no
matter
what
other
counts
maybe
invalid,
the
sentence
will
not
be
questioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
is
not
restricted
to
one
count,
it
is
not
restricted
--
those
often
applied
to
an
indictment
which
--
which
puts
the
single
transaction
in
different
forms
in
different
counts.
it
also
applies
to
multiplicity
of
charges
for
all
of
which
does
the
sentence,
but
the
appellate
court
may
find
some
of
the
counts
invalid
as
a
matter
of
pleading
or
as
a
matter
of
proof.
but
if
the
aggregate
sentence
can
be
attributed
validly,
it
counts
for
the
valid
and
validly
sustains
and
it
will
not
touch
the
sentence.
that's
the
clawson
rule,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
not
--
don't
mean
that.
but
before
since
--
any
number
of
instances,
it's
been
applied
to
multiple
to
distributive
counts
of
an
indictment,
part
of
which
is
challenged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
murphy,
isn't
there
a
great
difference
between
getting
enlightenment
for
what
the
judge
says
which
coexist
--
which
--
which
if
it
takes
an
obscurity
in
the
formal
judgment
and
as
to
a
judgment
as
de
novo
to
what
justice
brennan
said,
and
an
inconsistency
between
what
he
said
and
what
the
formal
mandate
is.
you
can
if
the
formal
mandate
is
clear,
one
word.
can
it
be
modified
by
something
that
he
said
if
there's
an
inconsistency
--
there's
an
inconsistency
remain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
so
too
but
this
isn't
a
question
of
ambiguity,
this
is
a
question
of
--
if
there
is
inconsistency,
that's
a
different
thing.
i
should
think
in,
i
don't
know,
like
you
i
don't
know
but
i
should
think
does
to
the
judgment
of
this
court
can
be
examined
in
the
light
of
its
opinion
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
judgment
means.
but
you
can't
find
a
contradiction
between
the
two,
and
therefore,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
which
judge
holtzoff
orally
clarified
and
another
thing
to
say
that
all
he
needs
is
one
thing
and
the
mandate
wrote
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
question
is
whether
--
whether
they
were
right
in
doing
so.
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
if
the
clawson
rule
is
right,
but
whether
they
--
but
they
didn't
take
too
much
liberty
with
the
record
in
so
construing
the
judgment,
a
formal
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
i
think
if
i
may
say
so,
there's
a
very
great
difference
between
an
appellate
court
undoing
a
sentence
that
is
clear
to
which
there
are
valid
counts
and
an
appellate
court
being
confronted
with
dubiety,
with
doubt
and
confusion
and
ambiguity
in
the
sentence
that
follows
into,
to
see
that
that
ambiguity
doesn't
result
to
the
prejudice
of
the
--
of
the
accused.
it's
a
very
different
thing
from
taking
liberty
with
a
valid
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
the
government,
why
--
if
you
have
--
that
this
is
not
a
proper
question
and
appropriate
question.
but
if
the
government
itself
has
doubts
as
if
what
was
your
placement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
difficulty.
if
the
government
has
--
were
[laughter]
i
like
your
distinction.
if
the
government
has
difficulty
in
knowing
what
really
that
sentence,
what
the
command
of
that
sentence
is,
why
isn't
the
natural
thing
to
have
it
clarified
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
--
you
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
my
brother
know
but
i
certainly
don't
know
your
reference
to
this
sentence
as
imposed
under
a
district
of
columbia
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
source
of
the
sentence
is
the
federal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
--
if
the
government
has
difficulty
with
--
knowing
what
it
meant
so
its
--
or
having
a
difficulty,
a
problem,
in
solving
a
problem
but
you
might
be
wrong,
might
you
not,
and
you
might
be
wrong
adversely
to
the
petitioner,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
but
--
but
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
i
have
to
say
or
is
it
a
fact
that
they
dealt
with
this
problem
on
the
implicit
and
explicit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
there's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
face
you
--
your
difficulties,
if
i
may
say
so,
might
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
go
back
a
minute.
i
think
judge
bazelon
is
more
--
is
more
ground
for
your
position
than
the
court
of
--
than
the
court
because
he
doesn't
merely
hypothetically,
explicitly
quite
i
agree
--
why
did
i
agree
with
my
brethren
that
the
record
supports
more
than
enough
convictions,
sustain
the
total
sentence
imposed.
he
evidently
brings
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
conclusion
on
the
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
2,
4
and
7
are
out,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
other
words,
2,
4
and
7
are
the
page
on
which
judge
holtzoff
(inaudible)
something.
but
the
path
is
gone
and
we
don't
know
what
he
hung
up
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page,
mr.
murphy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
concurrence
--
let
me
put
it
arithmetically.
if
concurrent
counts
attacked
on
to
three
preceding,
consecutive
sentences,
and
they
add
up
to
nine
years
and
the
judge
says
--
even
though
he
finds
them
guilty,
the
judge
says,
"i
sentence
you
on
these
other
counts,
15
years
which
is
the
sentence
that
i'll
give
you
on
the
concurrent
--
on
the
consecutive
count
to
run
concurrently,"
that
would
suggest
a
bad
mistake
of
arithmetic,
wouldn't
it,
because
now
it
doesn't
equal
to
15.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
counts
which
are
--
to
which
you're
attacked
on
concurrent
counts
are
knocked
out
as
illegal,
then
you
don't
modify
in
the
interest
of
mercy,
but
you
modify
because
you
haven't
got
anything
on
which
the
current
counts
compete.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
generalize
--
you
can't
generalize
--
this
court
had
a
doctor,
an
innocent
doctor,
i
think
he
was
in
jail,
although
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing
or
didn't
--
no
consciousness
at
all
that
it
was
narcotics
that
he
was
involved
in
because
of
the
--
of
the
great
--
though
in
this
court
we
have
a
great
danger,
the
generality
of
his
--
if
you
open
the
door
to
prove
that
a
fellow
didn't
know,
you
--
almost
everybody
at
least
didn't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
suggesting
you
can't
generalize
the
narcotics
cases
of
presumptions
as
though
appeal
the
presumptions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
because
of
possibility
or
--
or
judicial
laziness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
and
if
the
government
says,
but
that
isn't
a
basis
as
a
rule.
after
all
you
must
consider
the
--
the
whole
fitness
of
appellate
review
of
criminal
sentences,
is
irrelevantly
a
modern
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
question
is
what
it
is
that
was
given
to
the
courts
to
review
in
the
light
of
what
the
whole
history
of
criminal
field
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
nothing
--
it's
a
common
place
of
law
that
if
a
record
sustains
a
judgment,
you
don't
bother
about
the
ground
on
which
the
judgment
was
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
a
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
has
no
clawson
problem
at
all,
and
a
sentencing
judge
gives
a
lot
of
--
has
too
many
judges
from
my
case,
talk
too
much
when
they
sentence
anyone.
suppose
they
give
a
lot
of
reasons,
a
lot
of
obsolete
and
illogical
considerations
and
other
things.
this
court
was
--
was
confronted
with
even
sections
of
secret
reports,
said
--
i
know
that
was
improper.
a
reviewing
court
under
our
system
until
we
get
a
different
kind
of
system
like
the
english
system,
where
the
review
sentences
are
on
the
merits,
goes
up
and
down
until
we
get
that
system.
i'm
not
suggesting
i'm
for
it
because
that
has
big
problems,
and
lord
denman
was
chief
justice
(inaudible)
now
the
court
thought
as
the
chief
justice
and
sent
it
(inaudible)
so
until
we
have
had
(inaudible)
you
can't
just
tear
out
a
piece
out
a
whole
long
history,
complicated
history,
which
legislature
particularly
our
congress,
most
of
whom
were
lawyers,
were
not
ignoramus,
that's
some
knowledge
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
way
back
in
--
in
marshall's
time.
he
invoked
that
in
the
case
of
(inaudible),
one
count,
it's
plenty,
we
don't
bother
about
the
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
fine.
it
wasn't
merely
a
forfeiture,
it
was
fine
from
where
it
begins
from
(inaudible)
all
along,
this
is
an
old
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
fines
too,
if
there
are.
