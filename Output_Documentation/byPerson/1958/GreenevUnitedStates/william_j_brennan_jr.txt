justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
murphy,
may
i
ask
getting
back
to
the
commitment
and
what
judge
holtzoff
said
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
is
my
impression
is
correct
that
the
authorities
who
have
to
execute
the
commitment
are
required
to
execute
the
commitment
as
it
is
framed
in
the
judgment
of
the
commitment
and
may
not
resort
to
something
the
judge
may
have
said
in
determining
what
they
are
required
to
do
under
the
judgment
and
commitment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
official
authority
upon
which
i
would
indeed
not
only
defines
but
delimits
their
responsibilities,
the
judgment
and
commitment
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then
how
--
how
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
anyone
go
into
what
judge
holtzoff
said
if
what
he
said
is
in
anywise
inconsistent,
frankly
for
me
to
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
appellate
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
sure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
discretionary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
government's
position,
i
rather
gather
that
from
your
brief.
you
feel
then
that
in
any
one
of
these
cases
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
an
appellate
court
might
appropriately
exercise
discretion
to
say,
"well,
we
think
the
trial
court
might
want
to
take
another
look
at
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
is
much
what
we
did
do
in
yates,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
