may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
each
of
those
--
in
each
those
sales,
mr.
heller,
was
the
money
paid
at
one
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
something
involved
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
there
something
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
trial
judge
thought
one
of
the
reasons
this
man
was
guilty
of
a
very
serious
offense
was
because
there
were
15
counts
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
i
thought
the
judge
also
mentioned
15
counts
in
the
indictment
some
place,
maybe
i
am
wrong,
you
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
was
referring
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
--
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
he
gave
some
consideration
to
the
number
of
counts
as
well
as
the
amounts
that
were
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
well
--
well
then
the
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
that
is
true
but
if
--
if
it
affects
him
substantially
at
all
that
a
number
of
counts
were
charged
against
him
that
that
could
not
properly
be
charged
against
him.
you
think
that's
fair
to
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heller.
mr.
heller,
would
you
mind
addressing
yourself
to
the
--
for
a
moment
to
his
footnote
8
on
page
21
of
the
government's
brief
and
if
you
have
an
observation
that
may
concern
in
that
suggestion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heller,
before
you
--
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
just
like
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
court
that
we
appreciate
the
--
the
help
that
you've
given
to
the
court
in
this
case.
you
were
assigned
this
case
by
the
court
of
appeals,
handled
it
there,
and
have
handled
it
here
because
of
the
impecunious
condition
of
the
defendant
and
we
always
feel
comforted
when
lawyers
are
willing
to
assume
such
obligations.
and
it
maybe
of
interest
to
--
to
know
that
in
addition
to
this
case,
three
of
the
four
cases
that
will
be
heard
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
are
cases
in
which
counsel
have
been
assigned
to
represent
the
impecunious
defendants
and
are
here
at
great
sacrifice
to
them
--
to
themselves
and
we
appreciate
it
very
much
indeed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
appreciate
mr.
murphy
of
course,
your
representations
of
the
government.
