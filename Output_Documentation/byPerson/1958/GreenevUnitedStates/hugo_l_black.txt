if
the
clawson
rule
is
right,
what
would
be
the
advantage
of
that
level
with
the
court
or
as
the
dissenters.
assuming
that
you
can
unless
you're
going
to
say
here
that
all
these
counts,
if
some
of
them
were
bad
(inaudible)
the
court
might
give
the
smallest
(inaudible)
what
advantage
would
be
derived
from
that.
and
what
--
if
you
reach
that
conclusion,
would
not
--
would
that
not
be
an
abandonment
of
the
clawson
rule
or
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
step
that
up
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
assuming
we
were
going
to
send
it
back
on
the
basis
of
the
ambiguity
and
that
they'd
be
gone,
whatever
it
is.what
is
the
reason
for
that
unless
it
be
that
the
--
go
on
the
assumption,
that
the
court
could
give
a
small
assumption.
i'm
talking
about
frankly
speaking,
would
give
a
small
assumption,
a
reason
for
that
and
there
was
conviction
on
fewer
good
counts.
that
if
that
is
the
reasoning,
why
does
that
not
challenge
that
fact
in
the
clawson
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
but
--
but
you
understand
the
clawson
rule
as
to
be
into
this.
the
three
good
counts
can
be
found
out
at
15
clear
assumptions,
no
ambiguities.
the
three
good
counts
in
this
court
in
15
years,
and
under
the
clawson
rule,
the
case
is
not
reversed,
should
not
be
reversed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
and
the
basis
of
the
challenge
to
the
clawson
rule
as
i
understand
it
basically
is
that
maybe
the
judge
wouldn't
give
so
much,
if
there
were
fewer
counts
of
(inaudible)
conviction.
why
would
not
that
same
reasoning
apply
demanding
it
on
the
basis
of
the
ambiguity
in
those
three?
if
there
were
three
good
counts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
went
back
and
they
found
these
three
--
these
three
counts
bad
and
they
found
three
other
good,
should
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
four
and
seven
--
two,
four
and
seven.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
everything
else
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
the
evidence,
if
--
if
they'd
gone,
both
is
identical?
would
be
enough
to
support
you.
and
that
it
can
filed
in
two
separate
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
if
the
statute
is
written
anyway,
that's
precisely
the
same
proof
of
conviction
of
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
didn't
mean
on
this
case.
i
--
i
was
trying
to
--
sought
that
as
what
you
said
to
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
meant
was,
suppose
you
take
one
set
of
facts,
just
put
them
down,
you
find
if
there
are
no
facts
at
all
except
those
facts,
you
can
convict
to
two
--
for
two
separate
crimes.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
i'm
not
talking
about
this
particular
case.
is
it
your
argument
that
is
the
stamp
that
determines
whether
or
not
there
are
two
separate
crimes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
the
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
i
--
i
don't
understand
this
argument
you're
marking
ever
since
to
the
blockburger
case.
do
you
think
it
was
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court,
you
said
at
the
end
applying
the
test,
we
must
conclude
that
here
on
the
--
both
sections
were
violated
by
one
sale,
two
offences
were
committed
because
there
were
some
elements
in
one
that
were
not
in
the
other,
required
proof
of
some
elements
that
were
not
required
in
the
other,
is
that
right?
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
presumption,
you
get
into
the
tight
field,
do
you
not?
whether
you
can
have
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
thus
to
prove
beyond
reasonable
doubt
by
legislative,
the
prescribed
presumption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
construe
blockburger
there
and
the
meaning
it
set
as
fact,
test
here
whether
its
provision
files
the
proof
of
effect
but
the
other
does
not.
and
although
there
are
identical
facts,
can
be
set
out
into
your
presumption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
blockburger
is
limited
to
that
extent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
murder
and
assault
and
battery
but
you
convicted
both
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
analyze
both
the
assault
and
battery
maybe
it
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
convict
a
man
for
assault
and
battery
and
then
you
would
use
the
same
proof
except
that
he
died,
convict
him
of
murder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
(voice
overlap).
that
might
be
because
they
have
introduced
an
additional
element,
the
person
died.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
that,
you
mean
he
sold
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
proved
therefore
--
they
proved
that
he
sold
them,
proved
that
he
has
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
think
again
defense
for
the
blockburger
case
because
--
but
i
thought
that
since
his
--
our
position
has
been
overruled
on
that,
that
it
at
least
meant
that
there
had
to
be
a
--
they
had
to
meet
it
pretty
squarely
and
that
there
must
be
different
elements
proven.
justice
hugo
l.
black
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
a
valid
assumption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
is
no
way
i
guess
in
the
world
that
you
prove
one
way
on
that
and
the
other
side
to
prove
the
other.
the
rule
as
you
said
has
been
established
and
it
depend
on
so
many
different
things
might
at
some
point
depend
on
the
particular
judge
who
is
doing
the
sentencing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
were
there
serious
questions
involved
in
trying
to
decide
whether
those
counts
are
good
or
bad
and
they
raised
them
for
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
may
have
been
an
ambiguity
of
the
(inaudible)
there
wasn't
much
thing
to
do
and
just
read
the
sentence
back
to
the
(inaudible)
without
having
to
go
through
all
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
were
talking
about
parsimony
of
the
court's
time.
i
assume
you
mean
to
say
this
court's
time,
not
deciding
cases
it
didn't
have
to.
that
might
be
if
it
is
ambiguous,
that
might
be
the
best
thing
to
do,
was
it
not?
on
the
assumption
that
the
judge
would
take
a
new
look,
like
they
revised
it
or
maybe
revised
it
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
enough
for
good
to
justify
him
as
for
to
the
same
sentence
if
he
wants
to.

hugo
l.
black
