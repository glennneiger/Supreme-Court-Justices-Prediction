cover
the

have

on
particular
counts
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
--
do
you
--
as
i
understand
the
clawson
rule,
that
only
applied
provided,
the
--
there
was
sentence
that
cover
the
whole
term.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
is
the
situation
in
the
clawson
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)

(inaudible)

and
assume
that
they

and
that
they
are
(inaudible)
the
court
then
having
made
them
to
run
concurrently
with
each
other,
how
much
of
the
sentence
after?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
five
years,
that's
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
here,
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
have
the
question
as
that
it
now
has
on
counts
2,
4
and
7.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that
judge
holtzoff
made
in
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
the
other
offenses,
it's
much
to
be
argued,
run
concurrently
with
each
other
and
the
counts
to
the
sentence
is
on
count
2,
4
and
7.
that's
what
the
business
of
1,
6
and
7.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't
find
anything
wrong?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
did
say
they
run
concurrently.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
our
purposes
thereof
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
again
to
get
clear
in
my
mind
your
position
on
this
sentence.
you
have
stated
that
under
your
understanding
of
the
clawson
rule,
that
if
there
were
enough
individual
counts
upon
which
findings
of
guilty
had
been
made
and
sentences
imposed
to
support
the
aggregate,
then
under
clawson
rule,
it's
--
it's
good.
but
do
you
say
that
if
the
trial
court
made
those
counts
to
run
concurrently
not
consecutively.
repeating
my
position
more
briefly,
it
is
this.
does
an
appellate
court
have
the
right
to
make
consecutive
that
which
the
district
court
in
the
imposition
of
sentence
made
concurrent?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
that's
right.
let's
assume
that
they
were.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
and
they
haven't
been
so
determined.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
then
in
that
view,
we'd
have
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
the
validity
of
counts
2,
4
and
7.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
they
held
those
all
good,
then
they
defer
them
on
the
clawson
rule.
if
they
held
anyone
of
them
bad,
they'd
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
resentencing.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
all
i
say
--
but
if
it
found
one
of
them
bad.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)

charles

may
i
ask

(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles

whittaker
then
how
could
they
be
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
particularly
if
the
court
said
they
are
