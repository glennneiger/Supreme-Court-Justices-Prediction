mr.
james
h.
heller
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
of
four
cases
this
week
involving
multiple
punishment
questions.
it's
one
of
two
narcotics
cases.
it
also
involves
a
second
question
which
was
injected
as
we
contend
by
the
court
of
appeal's
own
opinion
that
kind
of
question
commonly
arises
in
cases
such
as
this
where
there
arose
some
multiple
kind
of
punishment
issues,
but
it's
conceptually
the
same
question.
the
facts
are
these.
this
case
began
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
on
a
15-count
indictment.
and
i
think
probably
the
principal
problem
in
stating
the
facts
in
this
case
is
just
to
sort
out
the
various
counts
in
the
indictment
and
get
them
arranged
in
my
mind
and
in
the
court's
mind.
for
that
purpose
both
the
government
and
myself
have
in
their
briefs
put
charts
about
this
indictment,
ours
is
at
page
8
of
our
brief
and
the
government's
is
at
page
5.
the
government's
chart
is
a
little
more
inclusive
because
it
includes
counts
1
through
3,
which
are
not
directly
at
issue
before
this
court.
but
i
prefer
my
chart
because
i
think
it
indicates
in
a
rather
graphic
way
what
happened
with
the
last
12
counts
in
this
indictment.
the
first
count
was
a
conspiracy
count,
and
the
second
and
third
counts
charged
violations
of
one
of
the
three
narcotics
laws
involved
in
this
case.
the
second
and
third
counts
refer
each
to
a
single
date.
i
should
say
by
the
way
that
all
the
events
in
this
case
except
one
last
event
occurred
in
january
of
1955
about
4
years
ago.
now
the
statutes
which
are
involved
in
the
case
are
precisely
the
statutes
which
we
were
before
the
court
in
gore
versus
united
states
last
year
and
they
are
also
the
statutes
in
the
pattern
of
prosecution
i
should
say
is
the
same
in
the
last
12
counts
as
it
is
in
gore
except
that
here
we
have
a
new
wrinkle,
a
wrinkle
in
which
a
single
sale
because
it
occurred
in
two
installments
is
broken
down
into
two
basic
transactions,
three
counts
apiece.
and
therefore
when
we
have
two
sales
thus
broken
down
into
two
deliveries
apiece
and
each
multiplied
by
three
times
we
get
the
last
12
counts
in
the
case,
which
are
shown
in
the
chart
on
page
8
of
my
brief.
mr.
james
h.
heller
the
sales
are
--
are
clearly,
if
i
may
set
aside
the
first
two
counts
your
honor
they're
only
background
material.
the
sales
involved
in
the
last
two
counts
are
two
sales,
one
on
the
21st
of
january
extending
through
the
23rd
and
one
on
the
29th
of
january
extending
over
midnight
and
to
the
30th.
now,
in
each
case
if
--
if
the
chart
on
page
8
is
looked
at
there
was
money
given
at
the
initial
meeting
or
before
the
initial
meeting
to
deliver
some
of
the
capsules
but
at
that
time
barbara
floyd
who
was
indicated
along
with
the
petitioner
but
turned
out
to
be
a
major
government
witness
she
was
doing
the
actual
delivering.
at
each
time
she
came
to
the
disguised
government
agent
and
she
said,
“i
don't
them
all
will
you
meet
me
here
or
there
later
on
and
i'll
deliver
the
rest
of
them
to
you.”
and
that
is
the
pattern
by
the
way,
the
pattern
in
these
sales
and
in
the
two
earlier
ones
which
aren't
directly
at
issue
is
that
a
government
agent
named
fialkewicz
approached
barbara
floyd
the
first
two
times
he
did
it,
so
far
as
is
known
completely
remotely
from
petitioner.
there
isn't
any
indication
that
petitioner
was
directly
involved
in
the
sense
of
scienter
and
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
between
floyd
and
the
government
agent.
he
asked
her,
he
said,
he
was
an
addict
and
he
needed
to
get
narcotics
and
he
asked
her
if
she
could
obtain
them
for
him.
and
she
said
on
the
14th
of
january
which
is
the
first
date
she
said
meet
me
later
tonight
at
a
certain
spot.
she
took
his
money,
she
went
away,
she
came
back
and
she
met
him
and
she
had
the
narcotics
capsules.
she
says
that
in
the
mean
time
she
went
to
petitioner's
house
and
got
the
--
gave
him
the
money
and
got
the
capsules
and
returned.
and
the
second
event
is
not
even
like
that.
it
--
it
involved
solely
barbara
floyd
and
fialkewicz
which
they
went
directly
from
their
meeting
to
her
house,
where
she
went
inside
and
got
the
capsules
in
exchange
for
the
money
in
her
own
bed
room.
and
she
said
these
were
capsules
from
willam
greene
that
i
had
had.her
testimony
on
that
score
appears
on,
appears
on
page
24
of
the
record.
now,
then
coming
to
the
last
two
transactions
i
would
ask
the
court
to
concentrate
on
counts
four
to
six,
that
is,
the
first
three
counts
in
the
first
sale
and
counts
10
to
12,
that
is,
the
second
three
counts
in
the
second
sale.
i
ask
you
to
do
that
because
those
are
the
six
counts
which
we
tentatively
agree,
at
least,
the
parties
are
the
only
ones
before
the
court.
i
can
explain
why
that's
tentative
a
little
later
on.
but
it
involves
the
ambiguity
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
in
those
cases
there
isn't
any
question
but
that
the
petitioner
knew
that
barbara
floyd
was
delivering
narcotics
to
a
third
person.
he
may
not
have
known
whether
it
was
fialkewicz
or
what
the
man
was
or
there
is
no
direct
testimony
as
to
what
barbara
floyd
told
him
but
it
is
clear
why
barbara
floyd
was
doing
this.
she
said
she
thought
he
was
an
addict
and
she
felt
sorry
for
them
having
personally
taken
narcotics
herself
and
she
decided
to
get
the
drugs
for
him.
but
she
said
she
knew
nowhere
to
get
drugs,
so
she
turned
to
petitioner.
now,
she
was
a
friend
of
petitioner's
and
this
is
how
petitioner
becomes
involved
in
this
case
so
far
as
motivation
is
concerned.
but
there
isn't
any
doubt
from
the
evidence
that
he
was
physically
involved
in
the
case
because
barbara
floyd
went
to
him,
got
the
narcotics
having
given
him
the
money,
then
came
back
and
met
fialkewicz
on
each
of
these
dates.
first
time
always
said,
“i
don't
have
any.
i
don't
have
any
more
right
now.
will
you
meet
me
later?”
in
one
case
it
took
two
days
to
get
a
hold
of
the
remaining
narcotics,
and
the
other
time
it
was
slightly
after
midnight.
now
there
is
one
rather
inculpating
remark
in
the
evidence
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
yes
in
each
--
at
the
--
at
the
first
meeting
--
at
the
first
delivery
meeting
i
should
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--
say
there
were
phone
calls
and
early
arrangements
but
at
the
first
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--
delivery
meeting
all
the
money
is
turned
over
to
barbara
floyd
if
it
hadn't
been
already.
now
on
the
21st
there
is
a
slight
variation,
the
money
was
given
to
her
in
the
morning
and
the
delivery,
first
delivery
occurred
at
night.
but
the
money
was
always
in
her
hands
by
the
time
she
had
delivered
the
initial
part
of
the
narcotics
and
then
she
said
i
have
to
get
more.
now,
there
is
one
inculpating
statement
in
the
record
and
i
don't,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
candid
to
duck
it.
later
on,
february
2nd,
fialkewicz
called
the
house
where
he
had
always
contacted
barbara
floyd
and
he
got
instead
the
petitioner,
it
was
the
petitioner's
house.
and
he
said,
“is
barbara
floyd
there?”
and
he,
and
petitioner
said
no.
of
course
this
is
all
testimony
of
fialkewicz.
he
said,
“no,
she's
not
there,
but
what
is
it?”
now,
maybe
i
think
instead
of
trusting
to
my
memory
if
i
can
find
you
the
exact
spot
in
the
record
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
good
deal
safer.
these
events
i
think
are
testified
to
at
90
and
91.
no,
i'm
sorry,
they
are
not.
excuse
me,
they're
at
88
in
the
record.
i
think
the
testimony
actually
starts
on
87
and
he
says,
“this
is
jimmy
lee,”
this
was
pseudonym
that
he
was
using
as
incognito
and
they
chatted
for
a
while.
and
he
says,
“i
want
to
pick
up
30,”
around
page
88,
“30
capsules
or
30
dollars?”
says
petitioner,
“30
capsules.”
“well
i
take
care
of
you.”
i
said,
“is
barbara
there?”
and
he
said,
“no,
she
delivered
for
me.”
now,
i
--
i've
gone
out
of
my
way
to
emphasize
that
because
it
is
probably
the
most
disastrous
direct
statement
of
--
of
petitioner's
in
the
record
and
yet
i
think
even
that
is
open
to
ambiguity,
when
you
consider
that
everything
the
petitioner
did
in
this
case,
so
far
as
the
government's
own
major
case
is
concerned,
is
shown
to
derive
from
barbara
floyd.
this
i
think
sets
the
background
for
the
question
which
we
have
here
in
the
substantive
aspect
of
this
case
which
is
in
part
the
gore
question
again
and
which
is
in
part
very
like
the
harris
question
which
is
in
the
case
to
be
argued
following
mine.
that
is,
in
part
we
have
the
question
of
whether
three
narcotics
laws
should
be
applied
to
a
single
sale
simultaneously
to
cumulate
judgments
and
punishment.
and
in
part
we
also
have
the
question
of
if
blockburger
is
still
adhered
to
at
the
end
of
this
case,
how
does
it
work?
what
does
the
rule
mean
and
how
does
it
apply?
particularly
how
is
it
applied
in
terms
of
evidence?
before
i
come
to
that
i
think
it's
relevant
to
know
in
this
case
what
the
sentence
was
imposed
by
the
trial
judge,
what
he
said
at
the
sentencing
and
also
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
the
sentencing
judge
was
judge
holtzoff
who
was
also
the
trial
judge
and
his
sentencing
remarks
appear
at
page
125
and
126
of
this
record.
and
he
says,
“this
is
a
narcotic
offense
of
an
‘exceedingly
aggravated
character,'
because
apparently
this
defendant
has
been
dealing
in
narcotics
in
large
quantities
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
some
of
the
counts
involved
quantities
as
large
as
40
capsules.
there
are
15
counts
in
this
indictment.”
and
then
he
proceeds
to
sentence
him
picking
out
three
counts,
counts
two,
four
and
seven
for
consecutive
sentences
and
the
other
12
to
run
concurrently
with
each
other
and
with
those
three
in
a
manner
which
i'm
not
entirely
--
will
be
able
to
solve
myself.
but
that
in
substance
was
the
sentence
and
the
case
was
brought
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
a
cryptic
opinion
which
appears
on
pages
131
and
132
in
which
it
said,
“the
record
supports
at
least
five
of
the
sentences
that
were
to
run
concurrently
with
the
three
consecutive
sentences.
it,
therefore,
supports
the
aggregate
sentence.
we
need
not
decide
whether
it
supports
the
consecutive
sentences
themselves.”
that
is
the
counts
two,
four
and
seven
on
which
judge
holtzoff
imposed
consecutive
sentences.
now
the
majority's
opinion
is
illuminated
somewhat
by
the
minority.
it
--
it's
again
a
merely
a
tentative
agreement
between
us
but
i
think
the
parties
do
have
the
common
assumption
that
the
majority
assumed
judge
bazelon
in
his
dissent
might
be
right
about
the
fact
that
some
nine
of
these
counts
could
not
be
sustained
on
appeal.
we
don't
know
that.
if
you
just
do
numerology
between
these
two
opinions,
you'll
come
out
with
a
one
count
disparity.
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
they
seem
to
have
avoided
the
consecutive
sentence
counts,
two
of
which
judge
bazelon
very
clearly
knocked
out
and
they
held
themselves
to
five
concurrent
sentence
counts,
which
is
all
that
he
left
standing
when
he
was
done
with
the
trial
court's
judgment.
he
first
said,
relying
on
blockburger
that
these
second
deliveries
in
the
case
of
each
of
the
two
later
sales
were
simply
following
the
same
impulse
as
the
first
deliveries
and
that
only
one
sale
was
involved
here
and
since
sale
was
the
crime,
unquestionably,
that
was
only
three
counts
per
--
per
sale.
now,
it's
only
a
fortuity
that
this
involved
the
blockburger
case.
still,
blockburger
was
an
opinion
in
two
parts
and
the
first
part
of
this
opinion
turned
out
to
be
lenient
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
and
the
second
part
of
the
opinion
turned
out
to
be
stringent
to
him.
the
first
part
of
blockburger
says
that
if
you
have
two
immediately
consecutive
transactions,
but
generated
by
a
single
impulse
then
that
is
only
one
crime
and
this
is
relied
on
wharton's
criminal
law.
this
is
at
284
in
the
area
of
302
and
300
of
the
blockburger
opinion
and
then
at
303
to
305
we
come
to
the
nub
of
the
question
that
was
before
the
court
in
gore
and
that's
the
question
i'd
like
to
discuss
first.
in
blockburger
and
i
think
it's
an
interesting
thing
that
the
gore
opinion
never
--
never
[laughs]
really
cited,
never
really
quoted
the
blockburger
rule,
but
the
court
--
the
court
in
blockburger
said
the
applicable
rule
is
that
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
the
case
was
cited,
but
the
rule
was
not
quoted
in
the
opinion,
your
honor.
that's
all.
the
applicable
rule
is
that
where
the
same
act
of
transaction
violates
two
distinct
statutory
provisions,
the
test
could
be
applied
to
determine
whether
there
are
two
offences
or
only
one,
is
whether
each
provision
requires
proof
of
an
additional
fact,
which
the
other
does
not.
now,
it
is
a
little
odd
i
admit,
to
be
here
the
following
term
having
also
argued
a
bit
in
the
gore
case
to
urge
this
court
to
reconsider
gore,
gore
having
been
an
urging
to
reconsider
blockburger.
i
definitely
think
that
the
reasoning
in
gore
is
not
sound.
i
think
there
are
reasons
why
this
case
may
present
another
opportunity
to
look
at
it.
in
the
first
place
this
case
involves
the
record
and
the
evidence
and
if
the
blockburger
rule
applies
this
case
really
exemplifies
the
technicalities,
the
almost
minutiae
which
become
the
vital
--
terminate
--
determinators
of
crime
and
punishment
and
lots
of
punishment
maybe
in
certain
cases,
under
the
blockburger
rule.
in
the
second
case
while
it's
more
of
an
emotional
factor
i
think
the
indictment
in
this
case
indicates
the
abuses
to
which
the
blockburger
mentality
can
be
carried
and
i
might
say
that
had
the
government
not
said
at
the
--
the
beginning
of
the
trial
in
this
case
that
they
were
relying
on
the
concept
of
sale
as
opposed
to
delivery
or
distribution
or
giving
away,
which
these
narcotics
laws
allow
to,
to
be
punished,
we
might
have
12
counts
in
this
case.
we
might
have
12
counts
because
they
might
have
chosen
a
different
unit
of
prosecution
and
it's
one
that
the
statute
provides
for.
and
as
i
read
gore,
one
of
the
basic
things
that
it
says
and
perhaps
the
basic
thing
is
that
where
congress
has
written
these
three
statutes,
has
imposed
three
different
requirements
for
the
sale
of
narcotics,
has
said
these
are
different
times
in
history
and
has
made
no
effort
to
refer
to
the
way
in
which
they
should
used
together.
this
court
will
presume
that
each
does
state
a
separate
crime
even
though
for
suit
in
one
transaction.
if
i
--
if
i
read
gore
correctly
in
saying
that
i
must
say
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
instances,
some
of
them
which
may
be
imagined
and
some
of
them
which
are
actual,
which
certainly
limit
that
rule.
i
might
say
at
the
beginning
then
i
--
i
can't
say
personally.
i
say
can't
personally
how
the
failure
of
congress
to
consider
the
interrelationship
of
narcotics
statutes
which
it
was
never
informed
were
being
applied
simultaneously
can
be
taken
to
mean
that
it
assumed
that
they
could
be
applied
cumulatively.
the
court
did
concede
in
gore
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
--
i
don't
exactly
do
that,
your
honor.
i
think
what
we
come
to
is
an
open
area
in
which
there's
a
choice
for
this
court,
as
i
think
there
was
a
choice
in
the
other
prosecution
cases
and
i
don't
say
these
cases
are
like
those
cases,
exactly.
mr.
james
h.
heller
they're
different
in
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
contend
that,
your
honor.
i
think
we're
in
an
area
where
the
judiciary
has
certainly
the
power
to
limit
the
prosecution.
if
i
could
take
the
bell
case
for
instance
which
i
think
is
the
most
eloquent
of
the
rule
of
lenity
cases.
the
bell
case
is
a
case
in
which
the
mann
act
says
it's
unlawful
to
induce,
entice
or
compel
any
woman
or
girl
to
transport
her
across
the
stateline
with
the
intent
or
purpose
to
induce,
entice
or
compel
any
woman
or
girl
into
debauchery
or
for
immoral
purposes.
now
listening
to
that,
reading
that
statute,
seeing
that
it
says
any
women
or
girl
twice,
one
would
have
thought
that
if
the
principle
of
leaving
things
where
congress
left
them,
which
is
what
the
government
has
argued
both
very
hotly,
first
in
gore
and
again
in
this
case,
is
to
be
the
principle,
then
certainly
that
act
makes
any
woman
or
girl,
not
a
group
of
them
who
happened
to
be
riding
in
one
car,
the
important
unit,
certainly
to
congress
intended
to
be
severe
with
white
slavers.
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
i
mean
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
but,
your
honor
the
point
that
i
--
that
i've
have
been
trying
to
make
both
in
the
brief
and
here
is
that
there
isn't
question
about
severity
here.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
in
the
mann
act,
either.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
severity
was
amply
served.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
may
be
served
by
death
of
the
person.
mr.
james
h.
heller
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
in
the
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
--
in
the
narcotics
act
of
1956,
it
went
so
far
that
we
argued
in
gore
and
i
think
plausibly,
although
i
don't
intent
to
reargue
this
part
of
gore
very
much.
i
think
we
argued
very
plausibly
that
when
anything
gets
this
severe
on
a
single
punishment
there
no
longer
is
any
basis
for
this
court
to
presume
correlated
multiple
punishments
in
a
case
and
the
courts
have,
since
the
earliest
english
history
has
been
telling
prosecutors
that
you
may
not
do
on
top
of
this.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
but,
your
honor,
i'm
not
trying
to
consider
it
abstract.
i
think
nothing
could
be
more
real,
and
i
concede
that
nothing
in
a
sense
could
be
less
legal,
than
the
question
of
how
long
a
man
is
to
serve
in
--
his
time
in
prison,
but
let
me
suppose
for
your
honor,
that
in
the
mann
act,
let
me
suppose
for
your
honor
that
in
the
mann
act
there
are
three
women
in
the
automobile
and
the
evidence
shows
that
one
of
them
he
has
induced
because
of
affection
for
him.
one
of
them
he's
enticed
with
money,
and
one
of
them
he
has
compelled
by
brute
force.
still
it
begins
to
look
once
again
and
let
me
suppose
further
that
the
mann
act
spells
out
these
three
different
crimes
inducing,
enticing
and
compelling
in
three
different
statutes.
i
don't
think
that
bell
case
would
have
come
out
differently.
i
think
the
prince
case
is
the
evidence
of
it
and
i'm
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
don't
think
anybody
is
likely
to
overrule
bell.
although,
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
rest
of
the
court,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
bell
stated
that
there
were
points
at
which
we
simply
arrived
at
an
open
area
and
ambiguity.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
--
i
might
add
too,
that
--
that
this
is
case
is
not
--
is
not
dissimilar
from
either
the
mann
act
or
the
prince
case,
although
it
is
from
universal
cit
in
that
all
of
these
in
federal
laws
are
only
supplementary
to
state
laws.
they
were
passed
for
that
reason
and
there
is
a
history
to
the
laws
which
i
think
is
quite
relevant
here,
and
the
history
is
that
these
laws
like
the
law
in
prince
which
has
after
all
two
sections
of
a
single
statute
as
opposed
to
two
different
statutes,
but
passes
at
widely
different
points
in
time,
is
that
they
were
gap-patching,
though.
that
in
one
instance
congress
had
passed
an
import
law,
but
it
didn't
believe
that,
that
got
a
domestic
traffic
of
drugs
that
are
already
slipped
in
then
it
passed
the
harrison
act
and
really
in
passing
the
harrison
act
it
was
most
concerned
with
doctors,
because
the
one
section
of
the
harrison
act
that
went
at
general
people
was
the
one
that
the
case
of
jin
fuey
moy
knocked
out
and
then
in
1919
in
response
to
that
decision
the
court
passed
the
third
law
and
probably
the
third
law
does
in
its
wake
aim
most
directly
at
the
ordinary
trafficker.
and
that
the
import
law
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
very
comparable
to
one
which
enforces
the
customs
laws.
it's
intended
to
aid,
to
get
offenses
and
receivers
of
imported
goods.
it's
not
intended
for
instance
that
if
you
or
i
are
carrying
around
an
ostrich
skin
wallet,
which
was
illegally
imported
that
we
are
to
be
put
on
trial
and
have
to
explain
to
our
--
as
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
why
we
had
that,
since
it
was
illegally
imported.
and
this
is
a
much,
much
older
statute
from
which
the
import/export
law
is
taken.
now,
these
registration
requirements
are
--
are
circuitous.
there
is
no
question
about
it,
to
put
a
stamp
on
the
drug,
which
nobody
believes
has
really
got
a
revenue
purpose.
the
only
real
revenue
from
these
laws
is
from
confiscations
and
from
the
registration
of
people
who
normally
are
authorized
to
deal
in
them,
doctors,
wholesalers,
hospitals,
veterinarians.
these
registration
laws
are
circuitous,
but
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
from
the
history
that
that
was
due
to
the
doubts
about
how
to
go
about
this
at
the
time,
and
i
think
two,
i
could
illustrate
this,
by
supposing
an
analogy
in
the
bank
robbery
law.
let's
suppose
that
congress
instead
of
wishing
to
penalize
the
actual
robbery
of
the
bank,
passes
a
law
or
five
laws,
four
laws
which,
one
of
which
says
it's
illegal
to
drive
to
a
bank
with
an
intent
to
rob
it.
it's
illegal
to
enter
the
bank
that
was
section
involved
in
prince
with
intent
to
rob
it.
having
robbed
a
bank
it's
illegal
to
leave
the
bank.
having
left
the
bank
having
robbed
it,
it's
illegal
to
not
report
it
within
30
days.
mr.
james
h.
heller
--
giving
the
example
of
a
supposed
instance
where
congress
had
got
--
gone
at
bank
robbery,
robbery
of
national
banks
as
indirectly
as
it
went
at
narcotics
in
this
case
and
i
think
i
have
previously
said
that
it
went
at
narcotics
indirectly
because
of
--
perhaps
to
a
degree,
an
attempt
to
make
it
easy
to
indentify
the
narcotics,
but
most
particularly
because
it
had
some
doubts,
doubts
which
the
government
in
its
own
brief
in
the
blockburger
case
which
was
quite
late
in
this
part
of
the
history
of
the
narcotics
laws
conceded
were
substantial,
some
doubts
whether
it
could
simply
say
narcotics
sales
within
this
country
are
illegal.
i
don't
know
whether
those
doubts
are
still
valid
or
not,
i
think
there
are
later
cases
which
indicate
that
they
would
not
be
any
obstacle
right
now
to
a
direct
passage
of
a
law
saying
you
can't
sell
the
following
narcotics,
unless
you
were
a
doctor
or
one
of
an
accepted
group.
the
bank
robbery
case,
i
--
i
suppose
was
one
in
which
they
carefully
left
out
however
the
offence
of
robbing
the
bank
just
as
congress
carefully
avoided
saying
anything
about
simply
selling
narcotic
a,
b
and
c.
the
closest
it
came
to
that
it
was
in
the
import
act.
i
think
there
is
a
case
that
something
like
this,
it's
a
case
which
i
didn't
cite
in
this
brief,
but
it
was
cited
in
the
gore
briefs
and
i
relied
on
them
heavily
because
of
the
massive
legislative
history
that's
contained
in
both
briefs.
ex
parte
neilsen
at
131
united
sates
reports,
was
not
two
different
statutes
but
it
was
two
different
sections
of
a
law
which
congress
had
passed
for
the
territory
of
utah.
and
one
of
them
was
a
law
involving
bigamy,
and
one
of
them
was
a
law
involving
adultery,
and
it's
very,
very
significant
or
at
least
it's
a
good
coincidence
in
a
sense
that
this
is
very
close
to
the
case
of
morey
versus
commonwealth
in
108
massachusetts
reports
from
which
blockburger
draws
its
quoted
strength
at
least.
that
is
--
that's
the
original
statement
of
the
different
evidence
rule,
the
blockburger
rule
in
this
country.
but
in
ex
parte
neilsen,
this
court
declined
to
allow
double
punishment
under
those
circumstances.
so
i
don't
think,
i
am
not
arguing
about
whether
the
theories
of
these
cases
proceed
directly
in
the
manner
that
we
suggested
in
gore
and
that
we
suggest
here,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
obstacle
to
this
court
simply
because
congress
without
an
intent
or
concern
to
correlate
laws
as
the
gore
opinion
suggested
they
might
be
in
a
single
provision
of
law
with
provisos,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
congress
neglected
to
do
that,
having
--
being
concerned
with
the
narcotics
matter
in
this
country
for
something
now
50
years,
is
conclusive
upon
this
court's
power
or
its
--
its
right
in
its
own
discretion
to
say
that
as
a
rule
of
prosecution
leading
to
punishment,
you
may
not
treble
these
counts.
if
they
are
closely
related
as
these
are,
if
the
statutes
aim
at
the
same
offense,
but
simply
impose
different
requirements
as
the
history
indicates
to
ensure
detection
and
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
kind
of
person
engaging
in
this
activity
who
can
go
scot
free
because
of
the
loophole
in
the
law.
and
that
i
think
is
the
substance
of
the
narcotics
laws
history.
i
--
i
intend
not
to
--
to
stay
on
that
question.
there
are
other
--
other
reasons
and
they
were
largely
summarized
i
think
in
the
chief
justice's
dissent
in
the
gore
case.
there
is
the
later
history
of
the
law,
the
severity
of
the
punishment,
the
attempt
to
achieve
uniform
punishment,
the
fact
that
under
this
pattern
of
prosecution,
the
first
offender
can
get
much
more
than
the
second
or
third
offender
was
intended
to
get
under
any
of
those
laws.
and
second
and
third
offenders
are
to
a
degree
treated
as
--
as
people
who
are
consolidated
offenders
under
these
laws
it
seems.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
their
punishment
is
consolidated
but
the
laws
then
refer
to
each
other
as
--
as
--
regards
previous
offences.
those
points
have
all
been
made
before
and
--
and
surely
this
is
in
a
way
a
debate
and
surely
as
we
argue,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
choices
for
the
court,
choices
in
--
in
what
i
think
is
a
decent
criminal
jurisprudence
and
a
choice
which
is
open
to
it
in
its
supervision
of
the
federal
courts.
but
the
second
question
is
the
question
of,
if
blockburger
applies
or
the
different
evidence
rule
as
it's
being
called,
how
does
it
work
and
was
it
violated
in
this
case?
now,
this
--
this
branch
of
the
case
was
--
was
pretty
clearly
indicated
in
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
the
gore
case
and
it
also
is
to
be
argued
i
think
almost
exclusively
in
the
harris
case
that
follows
and
i
won't
dwell
on
it
very
long.
but
to
go
back
to
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
evidence
against
the
petitioner
was
in
two
basic
parts,
i
won't
say
it's
merely
two
facts
but
it's
two
factual
aggregates.
first,
the
narcotics
agents
never
saw
him
with
the
narcotics
on
him,
nor
did
they
see
him
with
the
marked
money
which
they
used
to
purchase
it.
they
did
see
barbara
floyd
with
both
of
these
on
her.
they
arrested
him
rather
shortly
after
the
last
sale,
it
was
about
ten
days,
but
they've
searched
his
house
and
him
and
they
found
none
of
the
money.
the
indication
seems
to
be
that
he
was
simply
taking
the
money
from
barbara
floyd
and
going
out
to
somebody
else
and
getting
the
narcotics
and
passing
them
back
to
her.
but
of
course
that
activity,
barbara
floyd
testified
to
directly
and
it
was
corroborated
heavily
by
the
federal
agents
and
there
can't
be
any
doubt
that
he
was
aiding
and
abetting
her,
and
that
is
the
first
basic
fact.
secondly,
barbara
floyd
herself
testified
that
of
course,
he
had
the
narcotics
in
his
possession
when
he
either
got
the
money
from
her
after
he
had
gotten
the
money
he'd
gone
out
and
come
back
and
gave
her
the
narcotics.
and
possession
is
a
rather
important
element
in
this
case.
i
have
assumed
that
the
court
knew
the
laws
that
were
involved
in
this
case
because
they
were
all
there
in
gore,
but
i
think
it's
important
now
to
read
them
in
connection
with
the
way
the
--
this
question
of
how
blockburger
is
applied
here.
in
the
narcotics
drug
import
and
export
act,
the
statutes
are
printed
at
pages
2
to
4
of
my
brief,
reads
in
pertinent
part,
"whoever
fraudulently
or
knowingly
imports
or
brings
any
narcotic
drug
into
the
united
states
or
any
territory
under
its
control
or
jurisdiction
contrary
to
law,
or
receives,
conceals,
sells,
or
any
in
manner
facilitates
the
transportation,
concealment
or
sale
of
any
such
narcotic
commits
--
is
--
is
subject
to
punishment
and
imprisonment
--
fine
and
imprisonment."
now,
the
keywords
in
this
indictment
are
concealment
and
sell
under
--
and
sale.
under
count
6
and
12,
petitioner
was
accused
of
facilitating
the
concealment
and
sale
of
unlawfully
imported
narcotics.
the
second
statute
is
the
stamp
tax
act.
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
purchase,
sell,
dispense
or
distribute
narcotic
drugs
except
in
the
original
stamped
package
or
from
the
original
stamped
package."
and
that
was
the
statute
which
formed
the
basis
of
counts
5
and
11.
and
finally
the
last
one,
the
so-called
written
order
statute
dating
from
the
1914
harrison
act,
says,
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
sell,
barter,
exchange
or
give
away
narcotics
drugs
except
in
pursuance
of
a
written
order
of
the
person
to
whom
such
article
is
sold,
bartered,
exchange
or
given
on
a
prescribed
form.
two
other
features
of
these
statutes
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
oh,
i'm
sorry.
that
was
the
basis
for
counts
4
and
10.it's
hardly
--
the
statutes
numerically
are
inverse
to
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
these
companion
counts.
that
is,
the
last
statute
was
the
first
count
in
each
of
these
transactions
4
and
10.
the
second
one
is
the
second
count
5
and
11
and
the
first
one
is
the
third
count,
6
and
12.
now,
two
of
these
statutes
have
presumptions
and
of
course
justice
brennan
set
them
forth
in
his
dissent.
they
are
not
quite
the
same
presumptions,
the
import
export
law
says,
"whenever
on
trial
for
a
violation
of
this
subdivision,
the
defendant
is
shown
to
have
or
to
have
had
possession
of
the
narcotic
drug,
such
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
the
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury."
that's
mere
possession
of
a
narcotic
drug.
the
stamp
tax
section
says,
"however,
the
absence
of
appropriate
tax
paid
stamps
from
narcotic
drug
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation
of
this
section
by
a
person
in
whose
possession
the
same
maybe
found."
now,
that
makes
it
a
possession
of
unstamped
narcotic,
but
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
and
this
seemed
perfectly
clear,
a
possession
of
an
unstamped
narcotic
drug
will
prove
both
of
these
instances,
just
as
i
suppose
a
murder
would
also
prove
manslaughter.
it's
not
that
these
are
includable
offences
necessarily,
but
that
the
same
evidence
which
will
convict
under
the
stamp
tax
act
at
least
will
convict
under
the
import
export
act.
now,
of
course
these
presumptions
have
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
in
certain
context
and
i
don't
intend
to
go
into
their
intrinsic
reasonableness,
although
i
think
that
might
be
the
subject
matter
of
another
appeal
in
certain
cases.
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
same
fact
was
shown,
barbara
floyd
testified
that
he
had
these
in
his
possession
and
there
is
the
second
factual
aggregate
or
the
second
fact
from
which
his
guilt
could
be
shown.
now,
recurring
to
the
blockburger
test,
the
crucial
portion
of
it
is
whether
each
statute
requires
proof
of
an
additional
fact
which
the
other
does
not.
and
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
they
don't
require
different
proof
here.
whether
one
combines
these
statutes
with
the
aiding
and
abetting
act
which
is
18
u.s.c
section
2,
and
is
printed
in
our
brief,
or
whether
one
relies
on
the
presumption
arising
from
possession
in
the
case
of
the
two
statutes
which,
which
bear
those
presumptions.
the
same
evidence
was
used
here
and
the
statutes
required
nothing
more.
the
government
counters
that
argument
by
saying
that
the
statutes
require
what
they
say
they
require.
that
is
the
full
statutory
offense
as
it
is
spelled
out.
they
require
that
you
show
that
a
man
has
--
has
facilitated
the
concealment
of
sale
of
narcotics
which
he
knew
to
be
unlawfully
imported
and
which
were
in
fact
unlawfully
imported.
well,
they
don't
require
that
proof,
that
proof
is
almost
never
been
given
in
any
case,
i
think
it's
--
it's
pretty
clear
that
that
would
impose
an
insuperable
burden
on
the
government
in
most
cases
to
prove
that
a
man
knew
that
the
narcotics
were
unlawfully
imported.
courts
have
speculated,
this
court
did
in
--
in
the
yee
ham
case
that
because
the
narcotics
are
unlawful,
you
might
say
that
they
were
absolutely
prima
facie
or
at
least
they
could
presume
that
they
were
unlawfully
imported.
but
then
in
jin
fuey
moy,
they
said
the
(inaudible).
so,
however
the
thing
is
read
and
i
think
blockburger
requires
careful
reading
because
it's
a
rule
of
evidence,
it
requires
proof
of
an
additional
fact
under
one
provision
which
the
other
does
not
and
that
wasn't
met
here.
now,
the
government's
version
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
comes
down
to
saying
whether
east
--
each
statute
does
not
require
proof
of
the
same
fact
as
the
other.
that
is
they
would
put
the
burden
on
the
petitioner
and
you
show
that
in
every
instance
you
have
to
prove
the
same
facts
here.
we
don't
think
that
is
the
burden,
we
think
the
burden
of
blockburger
is
that
it's
a
rule
of
evidence
which
the
government
must
satisfy
before
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
way
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
here,
the
jury
was
invited
to
rely
on
these
presumptions,
the
charge
is
quoted
at
pages
12
and
15
of
our
brief
and
the
court
emphasized
them
in
these
two
cases.
so
as
to
aiding
and
abetting,
the
same
evidence
was
shown.
it
might
be
inferred
that
because
he
aided
and
abetted
barbara
floyd,
he
--
and
he
knew
that
she
was
dealing
with
a
third
person,
he
knew
that
she
would
sell
the
narcotics
absents
tax
stamps,
absence
the
receipt
of
a
written
order,
absent
lawfully
importation
of
them.
but
if
that
inference
is
to
be
used,
well,
it's
not
a
statutory
inference,
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
unitary
inference.
and
while
it
may
be
a
valid
theory
of
criminal
responsibility,
and
certainty
is
under
the
aider
and
abettor
act,
it
doesn't
provide
different
evidence
for
each
crime.
there
isn't
any
evidence
that
petitioner
actually
knew
because
he
was
there
that
barbara
floyd
was
doing
these
things.
and
i
think
what
justice
--
what
judge
learned
hand
said
in
the
peoni
case,
the
basic
case
before
this
court
decided
nye
&
nissen
about
aiding
and
abetting
is
very
important.
it
--
it
does
seem
to
be
supposed
in
many
cases
particularly
by
the
government
that
once
you
show
that
a
man
has
aided
and
abetted
some
part
of
a
criminal
transaction,
he
is
held
accountable
for
everything
that
follows
after
that.
but
if
he
maybe
held
accountable
for
probable
things
which
he
could
have
reasonably
foreseen,
contemplated,
shared
and
--
and
wanting
to
happen,
it
doesn't
follow
that
he
was
responsible
for
three
different
specific
things
so
that
they
have
been
separately
proven
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he
merely
aided
and
abetted.
now,
that
substance
is
the
first
part
of
this
case.
and
the
second
part
of
this
case
is
the
part
of
the
case
which
was
injected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
petitioner
argued
to
the
court
a
number
of
points
which
aren't
before
this
court
now.
he
attacked
virtually
every
count
in
this
indictment,
he
attacked
the
charge,
he
attacked
the
evidence,
he
attached
the
indictment
and
he
attacked
the
judgment
as
summing
up
these
other
areas.
but
he
didn't
contend
himself
with
that,
recognizing
what
the
class
and
rule
was,
as
it's
been
called
in
our
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief,
recognizing
that
the
class
and
rule
might
intervene
in
this
case.
he
also
asked
the
court
specifically,
"if
you
are
going
to
find
less
than
enough
error
here
to
warrant
a
new
trial
or
an
outright
reversal,
please
rule
on
these
counts
so
i
can
go
back
and
secure
resentencing,
if
only
i
can
do
it
a
discretionarily
under
rule
35
if
you
don't
choose
to
remand
it
for
resentencing."
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
precisely
the
thing
he
asked
it
not
to.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"the
records
support
some
five
concurrent
sentence
counts,
we
needn't
decide
whether
it
supports
the
consecutive
sentences
themselves
and
it
cited
the
hirabayashi
case
which
stems
from
the
case
of
united
states
versus
--
clawson
versus
united
states.
the
rule
in
clawson
versus
united
states,
it's
a
rule
which
is
set
forth
on
a
--
in
our
brief
on
page
--
pages
37
and
38.
it's
a
rule
which
evidently
stems
as
far
as
i
can
gather
from
some
dicta
of
lord
mansfield
in
three
cases
in
the
king's
bench
court
in
the
late
18th
century.
it
may
also
stem
from
certain
other
criminal
cases
in
that
court,
but
if
so,
the
house
of
lords
when
it
first
came
to
consider
the
rule
didn't
believe
that
they
were
binding
precedents
in
the
respect.
the
clawson
rule
sets
that
if
any
one
of
the
counts
is
good
in
a
multiple
count
judgment
and
once
the
judgment,
the
presumption
of
law
is
that
the
court
awarded
sentence
on
the
good
count
only
and
it
may
need
not
consider
the
other
counts.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
that
here.
they
said
some
five
concurrent
sentence
counts
are
good.
in
other
words,
they
were
willing
to
indulge
the
assumption
that
the
three
counts
which
judge
holtzoff
had
selected
for
consecutive
sentences
were
no
good
at
all.
and
then
they
said,
we
are
firm
on
that
basis.
now,
previously
i
said
we
have
tentatively
agreed
that
perhaps
the
majority,
not
by
any
stipulation
but
simply
by
--
by
common
reasoning,
that
the
majority,
and
the
court
of
appeals
very
likely
was
willing
to
concede
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
decision
hypothetically,
judge
bazelon's
dissent.
the
respects
in
which
he
showed
nine
counts
to
be
bad.
but
i
don't
think
it
can
be
assumed
at
this
point
that
those
are
the
specific
counts
which
the
court
of
--
court
of
appeals
majority
found
good,
the
remaining
six.
there
isn't
anyway
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
which
petitioner
can
know
really
what
did
happen.
but
the
presumption
of
the
clawson
case
is
that
the
trial
court
awarded
sentence
on
the
good
count
only.
and
if
the
trial
court
did
anything
here,
it
avoided
that,
it
awarded
sentence
on
counts
2,
4
and
7.
and
counts
4
and
7
are
particularly
glaring
case
because
they
were
two
deliveries
indicted
under
the
same
statute
arising
out
of
the
same
sale
and
the
blockburger
single
impulse
test
pretty
clearly
did
say
that
they
were
to
be
treated
as
one
crime
only.
so
counts
2,
4
and
7
being
the
specific
ones
on
which
the
judge
awarded
the
effective
sentence,
the
consecutive
sentence
are
the
ones
which
the
clawson
rule
would
have
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
presume
he
did
not
do
because
some
of
them
are
invalid.
i
(inaudible)
was
exactly
to
know
how
to
attack
this
--
this
rule
in
clawson.
the
government
says
that
its
persistence
in
the
federal
courts
can't
be
attributed
merely
to
sheer
accident.
i
think
probably
some
pragmatic
explanations
of
its
persistence
could
be
given.
one
of
them
might
be
that
normally,
people
don't
plead
as
petitioner
did
in
the
court
below
for
a
partial
reversal
and
a
remand
for
resentencing
because
i
suppose
most
lawyers
with
a
criminal
appeal
have
a
certain
go-for-broke
mentality.
they
--
they
don't
like
to
demean
or
seem
to
detract
from
their
arguments
that
the
case
should
be
reversed
outright
and
a
new
trial
granted
or
the
indictment
quashed
or
somehow
mitigated
or
shared,
it
was
cast
on
them
at
least
by
saying
in
the
next
breath
but
anyway
at
least
send
it
back
for
resentencing.
so
i
suppose
that
to
some
extent
that
minimizes
the
number
of
times
in
which
this
rule
has
ever
come
up
in
a
square
presentation
to
court
of
appeals.
it
recently
did
come
up
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
haynes
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that's
at
250
f.2d.
but
by
and
large,
it
has
been
a
remarkably
persistent
rule
but
by
no
means
a
consistent
rule.
the
court
has
--
has
applied
it
somewhat
discretionarily.
certainly,
it
didn't
apply
it
in
the
yates
contempt
case
and
there
isn't
--
there
isn't
to
my
mind
any
basic
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
think
that
difference
might
exist,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
control
the
sentences
would
seem
to
me
to
reinforce
the
rule
that
i'm
contending
for,
namely
that
the
trial
judge
should
be
given
another
look
at
this
record,
correct
it
and
relieve
to
theirs.
it
seems
to
me
inescapable
that
if
he
is
not
given
that,
the
court
of
appeals
is
exercising
in
non-contempt
cases
a
power
which
it
clearly
doesn't
have,
namely
resentencing.
if
the
majority
is
assumed
to
agree,
that
as
many
as
ten
of
these
counts
were
invalid
because
they
only
said
five
of
them
were
good,
then
they
are
saying
that
on
five
counts
we
would
give
the
same
sentence,
or
we're
sure
the
trial
judge
would
give
the
same
sentence
as
he
gave
on
15
counts.
mr.
james
h.
heller
he
doesn't
refer
to
the
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
he
refers,
your
honor,
to
a
case
called
fulton
versus
united
states
which
doesn't
by
any
means
either
discuss
clawson.
he
--
that's
on
page
139
of
the
record
and
he
does
refer
to
the
clawson
rule
and
the
case
is
cited
in
footnote
8
on
page
138.
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
he
--
he
says
--
he
refers
--
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
hirabayashi
is
simply
what
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
--
i
never
know
exactly
what
it
means
either,
your
honor.
but
i
am
certain
of
this
that
the
cases
cited
in
that
footnote
are
cases
applying
the
clawson
rule.
hirabayashi
is
one
those
cases,
the
case
where
there
were
two
counts
against
the
japanese,
one
of
which
was
that
he
had
violated
a
curfew
law
during
the
relocation
in
the
marshal
law
days
and
the
court
never
even
really
considered
the
first
count
because
after
a
lengthy
decision
by
justice
stone,
chief
justice
stone
had
found
the
second
count
was
good
and
it
applied
the
clawson
rule
and
it
didn't
cite
clawson
either.
mr.
james
h.
heller
yes,
the
government
has
cited
some
cases
that
come
right
up
to
this
term,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
yes.
pinkerton
applied
clawson
too
and
that's
the
case
in
which
it
said
it
is
settled
law
and
to
which
i
can
only
reply
that
as
lord
denman
said
in
the
o'connell
case,
it's
more
or
less
law
taken
for
granted
i'm
afraid,
because
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
very
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
wouldn't
press
too
heavily
on
this
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
i
would
[laughs]
--
no
i
would
--
i
didn't
know
that,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
yes.
that's
true.
there
were
two
judges
on
his
side,
but
there
were
three
lawyers
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
well
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
does
the
clawson
rule
stand
in
the
way
of
--
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
go
back
to
district
court
for
resentencing
in
this
stage.
i
think
judge
holtzoff
would
consider
the
petitioner
mad
if
he
came
in
there
and
all
he
had
to
say
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
were
at
least
five
good
counts.
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
that's
right.
they
specific
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
that,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
it's
almost
--
it's
almost
more
than
i
can
do
to
decipher
this.
it's
very
clear
what
judge
holtzoff
said
was
the
aggregate
consecutive
sentence
at
the
outset.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
don't
know
what
that
concurrence
with
each
other
mean.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
think
he
was
aggregating
what
he
had
previously
announced.
mr.
james
h.
heller
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
heller
that's
what
i
would
think,
your
honor,
but
then
they
run
concurrently
with
three
separate
counts
which
are
consecutive,
that's
what
--
what
bothers
me
most.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
think
there's
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
think
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
think
--
i
think
that
very
likely
is
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
i
would
--
i
would
certainly
argue
so,
your
honor.
in
the
brief,
we
have
almost
contended
ourselves
with
saying
that
if
they're
--
if
they're
not
good,
at
least
if
the
trial
judge
should
have
the
chance
to
reconsider
this
sentence,
i
think
it's
a
somewhat
ambiguous
sentence,
although
i
think
your
honor
has
directly
deciphered
its
legal
operation.
i'm
very
confused
by
making
accounts
run
concurrently
with
each
other
and
then
with
three
consecutives
ones.
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
it
may
be
my
own
experience
in
the
criminal
law
field,
your
honor.
this
--
this
is
not
a
field
in
which
i
am
used
to
it,
but
--
but
if
they
run
concurrently
with
each
other,
they
seem
to
collapse
into
one
count.
but
supposing
--
supposing
if
--
if
you're
right,
supposing
two
counts
are
knocked
out,
so
they
replace
one
or
both
of
those
two
that
are
knocked
out.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
--
but
--
but
i'd
like
to
think
you're
right,
i'd
like
to
think
that
if
these
counts
are
bad,
then
the
case
has
to
be
sent
back
if
i
understood.
mr.
james
h.
heller
it's
a
matter
--
it's
a
matter
which
puzzles
me
too
when
i
first
looked
at
the
trial
court
records,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
can
compute
it
as
a
$1500
fine
because
that's
what
judge
holtzoff
said.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
--
i
don't
know
what
a
concurrent
fine
is
either,
your
honor,
but
he
says
there
was
a
concurrent
fine
and
he
says
--
in
other
words,
at
page
r126,
the
aggregate
fine
is
$1500,
that
is
$500
on
each
consecutive
sentence
count
and
then
the
rest
of
it
is
all
$500,
but
nobody
can
see.
mr.
james
h.
heller
that's
right.
mr.
james
h.
heller
yes.
mr.
james
h.
heller
that's
right.
mr.
james
h.
heller
yes.
mr.
james
h.
heller
yes,
it
would
[laughs].
i
--
i
--
well,
i
think
it's
a
very
ambiguous
sentence
and
i
--
i
agree
with
that
but
what
i'm
really
--
what
really
bothers
me
is
that
it
could
be
the
clearest
sentence
in
the
world
and
the
clawson
rule
in
my
mind
deprives
a
man
of
a
very
substantial
right,
his
right
to
return
with
an
informative
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals
saying
this
is
the
function
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
me
saying.
this
count
is
good,
this
count
is
bad,
either
you
can
go
back
in
discussion
under
rule
35
or
we
will
remand
if
we
have
that
feeling
about
it.
that's
where
i
think
the
government's
view
point
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
estimate
of
the
probabilities
may
become
relevant,
but
we
at
least
give
you
an
informed
opportunity
to
go
back
and
say,
"please
resentence
me,
this
was
not
nearly
so
bad
as
you
think."
i
--
that's
pretty
well
covered
in
our
brief
i
think
and
i
--
i
would
prefer
to
suspend
now
and
save
the
rest
on
my
time.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
would
think
that
--
that
depends
in
part,
your
honor.
i
would
think
it
ought
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
instance
unless
--
unless
you're
on
the
points
which
have
not
really
been
briefed
here,
but
which
i
did
preserve,
but
the
petitioner
also
points
in
which
you
accept
judge
bazelon's
view.
if
that's
true,
i
would
think
it
could
be
remanded
in
the
court
of
appeal
for
remand
directly
to
the
district
court.
mr.
james
h.
heller
but
if
--
if
their
hypothetical
opinion
remains
on
the
nine
counts
which
aren't
directly
involved
in
the
first
question
in
this
case,
then
i
think
it
has
to
go
back
to
them.
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
believe
that
--
that
this
exposes
the
very
problem
that
i
--
i
saw
generally
with
the
rule.
now,
i
take
it
this
court
has
moved
to
a
more
specific
question
that
there
may,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
be
an
actually
illegal
sentence
if
we
can
find
out
what
part
of
this
is
valid.
i
think
this
--
i
think
that
the
construction
that
justice
whittaker
is
inclined
to
and
the
construction
which
footnote
8
suggest
is
the
proper
construction.
i
don't
see
how
this
can
be
considered
a
gross
sentence,
and
i
don't
see
how
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
said
to
have
considered
a
gross
sentence
when
they
use
the
word
aggregate.
now,
words
may
maybe
fuzzy
in
points
but
aggregate
seems
to
me
to
mean
the
sum
of
things,
whereas
gross
sentences
traditionally,
a
term
implied
--
used
when
you
impose
a
single
sentence
for
all
of
the
counts
put
together.
this
was
the
clawson
case.
there
was
one
sentence
implied
on
--
imposed
on
five
counts.
now,
i
don't
think
that's
--
it's
a
permissible
construction
of
this.
now,
if
that's
not
true,
then
of
course
this
must
go
back
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
must
pass
--
unless
this
court
can't
and
i
don't
think
the
case
is
in
their
posture
either,
must
pass
upon
the
validity
of
these
consecutive
sentences.
now,
i'm
at
sea,
i'm
not
as
familiar
as
justice
whittaker
and
as
other
people
in
the
(inaudible)
field
with
what
these
concurrent
sentences
do.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
they
were
free
to
plug
one
in
at
count
2
and
one
in
at
count
4
and
one
in
at
count
7,
but
evidently
i
think
grammatically,
justice
whittaker
is
right,
that
they
are
not
free
to
do
that.
mr.
james
h.
heller
no,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor
and
i'm
anxious
to
adopt
to
the
construction
which
is
most
favorable
to
my
client,
and
that
i
think
is.
and
that
gives
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubts
that
are
inherent
here.
i
was
quite
surprised
at
footnote
8
too.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
the
government
can
come
to
this
court
and
say
there
is
this
possibility
or
this
is
a
criminal
case,
it's
a
very
distinct
possibility,
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
really
settle
it
for
us,
but
we'll
simply
argue
to
you
that
the
possibility,
if
it
does
exist
should
be
ignored
or
disfavored.
but
if
the
possibility
does
exist,
the
government
says,
then
of
course,
the
case
has
got
to
go
back.but
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
function
of
appellate
review
and
that's
what
i
have
to
bicker
with
the
clawson
case
even
if
it
doesn't
rule
it
--
even
if
it
doesn't
govern
this
case.
appellate
silences
the
real
vice
of
that
rule.
you
don't
know
what
you've
got
when
you're
done
the
court
of
appeals
and
yet
that's
the
precise
reason
you
went
there,
or
at
least
that's
the
price
--
precise
reason
the
court
was
instituted
as
a
reviewing
court.
you
come
away
from
there
and
out
of
judicial
parsimony
or
conservation
of
energy,
which
is
a
little
more
appropriate
for
this
court,
whether
it's
discretionary
review,
the
court
of
appeal
has
told
you
nothing.
they
have
assumed
that
they
knew
what
the
trail
judge
did
and
what
he
would
do
again.
now,
more
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
the
government
says
it
is
tough,
the
government
says.
mr.
james
h.
heller
but
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
my
position
--
my
point
here
is
that
the
basic
thing
that
the
court
should
be
reviewing
which
the
clawson
rule
doesn't
permit
it
to
do
is
not
the
sentences
of
course
but
the
judgments,
then
make
it
possible
for
him
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court
and
say,
"you
have
control
of
the
sentence,
but
now
you
see
what
the
judgment
is.
you
did
it
once
before
on
a
false
premise."
now,
the
court
of
appeals
says
its
only
two-fifth
as
large,
one-third
as
large.
mr.
james
h.
heller
but
that
isn't
the
judgment.
this
is
a
sentence
in
which
the
--
mr.
james
h.
heller
but
the
trial
judge
has
said
there
are
unexpressed
consideration
or
he
hasn't
expressed
all
of
his
considerations
and
one
of
them
in
this
case,
it
turns
out,
is
the
number
of
counts.
that
must
be
true
in
lots
of
cases
where
he
doesn't
say
that
though.
this
seems
to
me
an
obviously
relevant
and
important
matter,
this
isn't
anything
in
which
i
think
a
conservation
of
an
energy
or
the
fact
that
you
can
say,
the
appellate
court
can
say
we
don't
believe
he'd
do
differently
on
remand,
should
prevail
over
the
rights
of
these
cases.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
think
this
rule
really
only
dates
from
1891,
your
honor
and
certainly,
it's
been
questioned.
mr.
james
h.
heller
but
--
but
you
forfeit
a
specific
article,
your
honor,
i
forfeit
this.
you
can't
split
that
up.
mr.
james
h.
heller
i
believe
those
are
forfeiture
of
specific
property,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
heller
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
the
rule,
because
of
it's
discretionary
application
is
entitled
to
all
this
concern.
either
it's
simply
because
of
its
age,
i
think
it
--
it
really
forfeits
up
on
its
face.
if
i
may
just
say
one
thing
about
the
blockburger
case,
your
honor,
i
want
to
tell
the
court
as
i
think
we
did
in
our
brief
that
there
wasn't
any
use
of
the
presumption
in
the
blockburger
case.
the
trial
court
didn't
even
charge
the
jury
on
that.
mr.
james
h.
heller
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
