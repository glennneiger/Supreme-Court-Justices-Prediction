did
you
make
that

all

justice
potter
stewart
you
--
you
said
you
took
the
position
all
the
way
through,
was
it?
that
these
fcc
proceedings
in
no
way
affected
your
right
to
institute
antitrust
proceedings
in
a
court
of
law
and
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
took
it
to
whom
you
told
them
about
it?
who,
if
anybody
did
you
tell
about
this
position
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
did
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
segal,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
could
it,
mr.
segal,
have
asked
the
fcc
to
defer
its
decision
pending
of
further
investigation
demanded
by
the
department
of
justice?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
one
other
thing,
mr.
segal.
as
i
--
and
i
--
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
state
as
to
say
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
in
--
on
many,
many
occasions,
the
department
of
justice
has
intervened
in
cases
of
this
nature
before
the
federal
communications
commission.
