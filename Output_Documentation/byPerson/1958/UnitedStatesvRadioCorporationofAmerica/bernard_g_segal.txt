mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
apprehend
the
argument
of
my
friend,
the
solicitor
general.
it
is
--
that
although
the
federal
communications
commission
was
the
proper
agency
to
pass
upon
this
transfer.
although
he
concedes
that
the
commission
when
it
passed
upon
the
transfer
had
before
it
all
the
facts
which
the
department
of
justice
now
has.
although
he
concedes
that
the
department
--
that
the
federal
communications
commission
had
a
duty
to
make
the
determination
which
it
did
make.
although
he
concedes
that
the
federal
communications
commission
did
make
a
determination
on
these
facts,
and
that
in
the
course
of
doing
so
it
necessarily
found
that
the
proposed
transfer
was
in
the
public
interest.
although
he
concedes
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
under
the
statute
to
make
the
determination
which
the
commission
did
make.
although
he
concedes
that
the
statute
under
which
the
commission
acts
makes
that
determination
final
unless
an
appeal
was
taken
under
the
statute.
although
he
concedes
that
the
department
of
justice
had
an
opportunity
too
but
did
not
participate
in
this
proceeding
as
it
has
by
the
way
of
many
proceedings
before
this
court,
did
not
seek
the
hearing
which
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
i
may
say
it
clearly
have
the
right
to
get.
although,
it
did
not
take
the
appeal
which
the
statute
expressly
provided
in
the
exclusive
way
provided
by
the
statute.
although
he
concedes
that
the
department
of
justice
has
no
new
facts
which
have
developed
from
the
day
the
application
was
acted
upon
by
the
commission
until
the
day
the
complaint
was
filed
and
presumably
certainly
until
today.
nevertheless,
he
urges
upon
this
court
that
when
the
department
of
justice
later
concluded
on
the
identical
facts
that
the
transfer
was
not
as
the
commission
found
in
the
public
interest.
the
department
should
be
permitted
to
maintain
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
or
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
for
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
as
null
and
void,
not
a
conspiracy,
but
the
very
transaction,
the
very
transaction
which
the
federal
communications
commission
approved.
now,
i
say
to
your
honors
that
in
an
effort
to
justify
that
really
remarkable
position,
and
one
completely
without
precedent,
we
have
studied
every
page
we
could
find.
and
i
am
comforted
in
our
conclusion
that
there
was
no
precedent
because
the
solicitor
general
who
is
of
course
always
very
efficient
has
cited
none.
in
an
effort
to
do
that,
what
does
he
do?
well,
he
broadens
the
issues
into
questions
of
conspiracy,
into
questions
of
sherman
act,
into
broad
general
policies,
which
i
shall
endeavor
to
narrow
to
present
to
your
honors
just
what
the
issue
was.
and
he
avoids
what
is
really
a
very
simple
statement
of
facts.
so
simple
that
when
we
before
the
trial
court
said,
“no,
we
prefer
to
go
ahead.”
and
try
the
space
against
the
framework
of
a
full
presentation
of
all
the
facts,
it
was
the
government
as
this
record
shows,
who
said,
“no.”
it
was
the
government
who
appeared
before
judge
kirkpatrick
and
argued
vigorously,
and
had
several
people
there
to
say
what's
the
use
of
trying
to
this
case
since
all
the
facts
can
be
conceived
now?
and
if
the
defendants
are
correct,
the
government
doesn't
want
to
proceed
with
the
case.
and
so
we
entered
into
a
stipulation
of
facts
and
there
are
--
while
the
stipulation
has
13
averments,
i
may
say
to
your
honor
that
just
--
your
honors
that
just
a
very
few,
actually
three
or
four
numbers
are
significant.
the
stipulation
does
explain
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
rather
simple.
nbc
had
--
no,
cleveland
stations,
westinghouse,
and
philadelphia
stations.
nbc,
pursuant
to
the
commission
authority,
as
commissioner
doerfer
say
in
the
opinion
to
which
the
solicitor
general
has
referred,
had
a
affiliation
with
westinghouse
which
it
had
the
right
to
renew
or
not
to
renew
as
it
saw
fit
within
two
years.
this
is
something
which
the
federal
communications
commission
in
the
full
wisdom
of
its
regulatory
authority
has
decided
it's
good
for
the
industry.
and
i
take
it
that
this
is
something
that
is
not
before
the
court
matter.
and
in
the
exercise
of
that
part
it
sat
down
with
westinghouse
and
it
said,
“we
think
we
need
the
philadelphia
station.
we're
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
--
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
a
much
greater
extent;
you're
in
the
western
part,
we
have
the
cleveland
stations.”
and
in
any
event
they
worked
out
a
deal.
and
the
deal
simply
was
that
westinghouse
would
get
the
philadelphia
--
the
cleveland
stations
and
that
--
that
nbc
would
get
the
philadelphia
stations.
and
because
the
difference
in
earning
power
when
capitalized
came
to
$3
million.
westinghouse
would
get
an
additional
$3
million.
now,
that's
the
whole
deal.
that's
the
entire
transaction.
and
i
may
say
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
as
to
whether
the
commission
passed
upon
these
facts
that
i
need
only
to
read
to
you
a
statement
from
the
opinion
by
commissioner
doerfer
which
appears
at
page
163
of
the
transcript.
he
writes
it
for
himself
and
one
other
commissioner
in
answer
to
commissioner
bartley.
i'll
read
the
last
full
sentence
on
that
page.
“it
is
impossible
to
read
from
this
record
that
the
board
of
directors
of
westinghouse
were
intimidated
by
force
or
fear.”
and
he
goes
on
to
the
next
page
at
164,
the
same
observation
can
be
made
with
respect
to
the
question
concerning,
“the
apparent
withholding
of
the
nbc
affiliation
for
westinghouse's
pittsburgh
station.”
and
finally
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
in
the
last
two
paragraphs,
commissioner
doerfer
now,
the
chairman
says,
“in
the
instant
case
there
is
no
scintilla
of
evidence
that
nbc
conspired
with
anyone
to
monopolize
production
of
network
or
local
programs.
no
price
fixing
for
advertises
were
remotely
upturned.
nbc
exercise
the
superior
bargaining
position
to
exchange
a
smaller
market
station
in
cleveland
for
a
larger
one
in
philadelphia.
no
suggestion
is
made
that
nbc
is
attempting
to
keep
other
networks
out
of
the
philadelphia
market
or
any
other
market
nor
that
it's
conspired
with
anyone.
even
westinghouse
is
free
to
reenter
the
philadelphia
market
with
another
network
company
or
as
an
independent
if
it
be
so
advised.
no
restraint
of
trade
or
attempt
to
monopolize
and
so
on.”
that
is
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
whether
the
commission
actually
did
pass
on
this
question.
now,
your
honors
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
antitrust
suit
was
started
in
1955,
in
december
1956,
pardon,
in
december
1956.
it
was
16
months
after
the
department
was
notified
that
these
applications
were
pending
and
that
there
were
antitrust
issues
involved.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
waiting
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it's
in
suspense
by
virtue
of
the
government's
argument
that
the
facts
were
so
simple
quite
contrary
to
the
issues
today
that
they
could
be
stipulated.
and
i
direct
your
honors'
attention
then
to
the
critical
provisions
of
the
stipulation.
they
are
printed
at
appendix
b
to
our
brief
and
they
appear
--
it
appears
at
139
of
the
record.
and
i
refer
first
to
paragraph
7,
the
last
sentence.
oh,
let
me
just
say
to
your
honors
in
passing.
this
question
of
whether
there
was
a
hearing
i'd
like
to
get
out
of
the
way
because
it's
covered
by
the
stipulation
and
because
commissioner
doerfer
covers
it
very
fully
in
this
hearing
and
he
covers
it
almost
in
the
language
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
in
explaining
the
procedures
of
administrative
commission.
under
the
procedure,
the
federal
communications
commission
with
all
the
facility
that
comes
to
an
administrative
body
rather
than
a
court.
and
i
take
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
original
establishment
of
administrative
bodies.
it
points
out
that
the
only
time
for
a
hearing
is
when
something
is
to
be
accomplished
by
a
hearing.
what
happened
here?
the
fcc
instituted
as
extensive
an
investigation
as
i
ever
--
as
i
have
ever
known
and
incidentally
those
words
are
used
in
the
stipulation,
"extensive
investigation."
they
sent
investigators
out
to
every
single
person
who
had
anything
to
do
with
this,
not
just
at
nbc
and
not
just
at
westinghouse,
but
any
other
allegation,
not
without
knowledge
of
the
department
of
justice.
they
had
everything
the
department
of
justice
had
because
the
transcript
says
that
not
--
i
mean
the
stipulation
--
that
not
only
did
the
department
of
justice
--
was
the
department
of
justice
kept
fully
informed
by
the
fcc
but
that
they
exchanged
information.
and
so
they
went
to
the
individuals
in
philadelphia
who
allegedly
were
contacted
by
nbc
to
see
whether
nbc
could
acquire
another
station.
they
did
a
thorough
complete
workman-like
job,
the
broadcast
bureau
of
the
commission.
and
when
they
were
all
through,
they
decided
that
under
section
309
(b)
of
the
act,
they
could
not
proceed
without
a
hearing.
that
they
required
other
information
on
certain
issues,
and
they
define
the
issues.
and
i
may
say
to
your
honor
that
among
the
issues
defined
were
largely
antitrust
issues,
largely
the
things
that
the
solicitor
general
talks
about
today.
and
both
parties,
both
parties
submitted
very
full
and
complete
answers.
and
again
the
broadcast
bureau
filed
its
decision.
and
then
the
broadcast
bureau
said,
“well
now,
in
view
of
what
we
have
now,
there's
nothing
to
be
accomplished
by
you.
there's
no
protesting.
the
department
of
justice
has
had
plenty
of
notice.
it
hasn't
come
in.
it
hasn't
done
a
thing.
it
hasn't
shown
an
interest
in
this
thing.
it
hasn't
indicated
the
things
such
a
violation.
why
have
a
hearing?"
commissioner
doerfer
even
said
that
he
thought
that
what
the
commission
now
had
was
more
than
it
could
get
out
of
a
proceeding
where
witnesses
came
on
the
stand
and
the
restraints
of
being
on
a
witness
stand
and
subject
to
all
of
the
rigors
of
a
trial.
and
so
with
no
complaint
from
anybody,
and
i
may
say
with
the
concurrence
even
of
the
broadcast
bureau
which
had
thought
there
should
be
a
hearing
and
acted
as
an
adversary
board,
the
commission
went
ahead,
and
said
that
we
don't
need
a
hearing.
now,
if
that
isn't
the
purpose
of
administrative
proceeding,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
no
one
has
ever
argued.
that
because
of
the
false
judgment
doesn't
involve
a
hearing,
it's
not
res
judicata.
and
here
we
don't
even
have
to
argue
res
judicata
as
i'll
show
in
a
moment.
but
let
me
get
back
to
the
stipulations.
paragraph
7
says
behalf
in
the
last
sentence
the
fcc
had
before
it
all
of
the
evidence
relating
to
what?
relating
to
all
of
the
antitrust
issues
presented
by
the
complaint
in
this
action.
now,
there
we
have
it.
no
issue,
antitrust
in
which
they
didn't
have
all
the
evidence.
no
issue
presented
in
the
complaint
as
to
which
they
didn't
have
all
the
evidence
which
the
department
of
justice
now
has,
paragraph
7
--
8.
in
considering
the
proposed
exchange,
the
fcc
had
a
duty
to
and
it
did
consider
whether
the
evidence
before
it
showed
any
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
i
want
to
talk
more
about
that
in
a
moment.
but
it's
shocking
to
me
to
have
the
government
say
that
in
deciding
the
public
interest,
the
commission
didn't
have
the
plenary
duty
to
decide
whether
this
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
i
may
say
just
because
mr.
justice
harlan
has
shown
interest
in
the
case
that
i
think
hasn't
much
relation,
the
mackay
case
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
because
that
was
a
--
a
case
of
a
common
carrier
regulated
in
a
much
different
way
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
your
honor.
i
was
just
in
the
midst,
when
the
recess
came,
of
addressing
myself
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
inquiries
concerning
the
mackay
case.
i
had
pointed
out
that
that
was
quite
a
different
type
of
regulated
party
than
in
this
case.
in
that
case,
it
involved
a
regulated
common
carrier.
well,
of
course
it's
different
in
many
ways
from
the
one
involved
here.
and
all
the
court
held
there
was
that
the
federal
communications
commission
could
not
grant
the
application
of
mackay
solely
in
order
to
increase
competition.
that
couldn't
be
the
sole
standard
it
used
regardless
of
other
factors
where
a
telegraph
common
carrier
was
involved.
but
i
might
point
out
there
quite
different
from
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
here
today
and
i
quote
from
the
government's
brief
in
this
communications
commission
case,
“it
has
settled
laws,”
said
the
government
there,
“that
the
public
interest
embraces
national
policies
reflected
in
general
legislation
and
judicial
decision.
thus,
the
national
policy
in
favor
of
competition
which
is
reflected
in
the
antitrust
laws
becomes
a
part
of
--
becomes
a
part
of
any
statute
which
sets
forth
a
public
interest
standard.”
now,
your
honors,
i
was
going
through
the
stipulation
and
i'm
almost
through
with
it,
i've
gotten
through
the
point
that
they
had
all
the
evidence
on
all
of
the
antitrust
issues.
they
had
a
duty
to
consider
the
antitrust
issues
and
i
come
to
paragraph
9,
which
says
not
only
did
they
have
a
duty
to
consider
but
the
fcc
decided
all
issues
relating
to
the
exchange
which
it
could
lawfully
decide.
it
left
nothing
--
left
nothing
undecided.
and
then
the
question
is,
well,
might
could
have
been
invalid,
might
have
not
be
pursuant
for
the
act
when
we
come
to
paragraph
10.
the
fcc
granted
the
exchange
applications.
it
was
argued,
the
date
is
given.
its
action
was
a
valid
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction
and
was
taken
pursuant
to
and
in
accordance
with
the
act.
so,
there's
no
question
about
the
validity
of
what
is
here
in
issue
as
i
shall
show.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
say
to
your
honors
that
the
stipulation
was
batted
out
by
the
government
and
by
us.
what
happened
was,
we
were
in
a
long,
long
hearing
before
the
judge
and
the
government
was
present.
and
saying
that
all
the
facts
are
simple
and
i
was
saying,
“well,
would
you
concede
this
fact?”
and
the
government
said,
“yes,
we
would
concede
it,
we
think
it's
present.”
“would
you
concede
this
fact?”
and
in
that
way,
the
transcript
was
gotten
up
and
finally,
it
happened
that
i
left
for
the
meeting
of
the
american
bar
association
in
london
and
i
couldn't
participate
in
my
associates
and
the
--
the
members
of
department
of
justice
got
up
a
stipulation
which
judge
kirkpatrick
read
and
approved
as
being
in
accord
with
the
transcript.
and
by
the
way,
for
some
reason,
i
don't
understand
that
too
has
been
put
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
--
of
testimony
in
this
case
by
the
government.
they
have
certified
it
up
as
part
of
the
transcript
of
record.
all
that
argument
and
all
our
argument
below
is
somehow
rather
has
crept
up
into
this
transcript.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think,
your
honor
that
quite
clearly
it's
not
binding.
i
think
it's
correct,
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
it
shows
that
here
are
two
litigants
whose
horns
are
locked
in
battle,
who
have
divergent
interest,
agree
that
this
is
the
law,
is
at
least
persuasive.
that
if
the
department
of
justice
and
counsel
for
rca
and
nbc
think
it's
the
holding,
at
least
to
enlighten
me
of
what
it
is
your
honor
that
it
is,
i
agree
it's
not
binding.
i
may
say
to
you
that
i
think
all
of
the
stipulations
except
perhaps
that
part
of
it,
relate
the
to
the
fact
that
are
not
involved.
the
--
paragraph
11
i
referred
to
and
it
just
shows
that
we
did
exchange
in
for
--
that
the
fcc
and
the
department
did
exchange
information,
but
more
than
that,
that
the
department
kept
--
the
depart
--
federal
communications
commission
kept
the
department
fully
informed.
paragraph
12,
i
shall
not
belabor,
that
simply
is
a
statement
of
all
of
the
four
or
five
procedures
that
the
department
of
justice
couldn't
take
it.
it
didn't
have
to
come
in
the
beginning
of
the
proceeding
when
maybe
it
didn't
know
what
was
on.
it
could
have
come
in
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding.
it
could
have
asked
for
a
hearing,
it
could
have
filed
a
protest
in
the
30
days
after
the
decision.
it
could
have
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
then
could
have
taken
an
appeal
for
the
court.
and
finally
on
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
assume
it
could
but
i
want
to
emphasize
here,
your
honor
that
i
can
see
a
very
good
reason
for
it.
actually,
my
friend,
the
solicitor
general
has
talked
about
the
statutory
practices
in
good
--
this
is
a
governed
capsule
transaction.
and
the
reason
in
answer
to
who
wrote
the
stipulation
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked,
the
reason
of
stipulation
was
not
difficult
to
get
to
at,
is
it
--
with
such
a
simple
statement
of
fact.
here,
two
companies
had
a
transaction
and
here
they
agreed
on
it.
and
here,
the
fcc
had
said
that
the
affiliation
was
a
two-year
proposition
and
rca
had
--
nbc
had
the
right
either
to
renew
it
or
not
to
renew
it.
now,
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
very
directly,
the
fact
was
that
the
parties
had
come
to
an
agreement
and
there
were
no
other
facts
that
the
department
of
justice
had
to
look
into,
but
had
the
department
needed
more
time,
the
record
is
clear
it
didn't
because
they
discovered
no
facts
but
the
fcc
didn't
know.
i
haven't
the
remotest
doubt
that
the
communications
commission
would
have
grant
time.
and
they
say,
your
honors,
it
took
seven
months
if
it
was,
to
decide
this
case
from
the
date
of
application
to
the
time
we
could
make
our
exchange.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
this
court
has
had
just
quite
recently
the,
(inaudible)
case
where
the
department
of
justice,
even
where
they
had
the
power
to
grant
exemption,
where
the
department
of
justice
went
in
and
carried
the
proceeding
before
the
federal
maritime
board.
the
mclean
trucking
case
where
the
associated
trucking
tried
to
absorb
six
or
seven
companies.
the
department
of
justice
antitrust
commission
went
in
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
tried
the
case
to
argue
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
for
them
to
perform
for
the
icc
to
authorize
this.
it
would
--
it
--
it's
not
at
all
unusual
in
our
jurisprudence
more
than
to
come
into
these
cases.
now,
i
don't
think
they
come
in
to
this
case
but
neither,
your
honor,
have
they
filed
this
kind
of
proceeding
anywhere.
i
take
it
that
it's
simply
because
they
haven't
taken
the
position
that
the
very
grant
of
a
permit
or
a
license
which
is
what
they're
taking
here
is
the
grant
of
the
license
that
they
say
as
i
shall
show,
violates
the
law.
and
not
all
this
extraneous
business
that's
been
talked
about
and
i
want
to
get
to
the
complaint
in
a
minute.
it's
the
back
that
the
department
now
takes
the
position
that
in
granting
the
application,
ipso
facto,
a
violation
to
antitrust
law
was
authorized
in
perpetrators.
i
would
take
it
if
there's
a
conspiracy
here
that
as
much
a
conspirator
would
be
--
well
i
--
i
believe
that
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
department
didn't
act.
the
fcc
did
act.
we
acted
pursuant
to
it
and
if
there's
any
conspirator,
i
take
it
we're
not
one.now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think
it
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think,
your
honor
that
when
i
get
to
the
complaint
and
show
you
what
they're
asking
for
here.
i
can
persuade
your
honors
that
the
--
when
the
fcc
approved
this
transaction
and
when
the
parties
--
and
that's
paragraph
13,
i
was
getting
through
in
the
stipulation
which
says
that,
“we
acted
in
reliance
on
the
determination
and
affecting
the
exchange.”
when
we
did
act
in
reliance
on
that
determination
and
that's
paragraph
13
of
the
stipulation.
when
we
acted
in
reliance
when
the
time
to
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
had
expired,
when
the
department
of
justice
and
everyone
else
with
full
knowledge
of
all
of
the
facts
refrained
from
doing
anything
and
when
we
went
ahead
and
effected
these
large
business
transactions
involving
the
uprooting
of
people
from
philadelphia
to
cleveland
and
cleveland
to
philadelphia
and
all
the
rest
of
what's
in
judge
kirkpatrick's
opinion,
then
the
department
lost
its
right
to
say
that
the
very
transaction
approved
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
it
could
ask
the
district
court
to
disapprove.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
in
this
field
and
i
don't
think
it
is.
but
if
this
field
is
a
field
in
which
any
government
agency
needs
more
than
the
time
that
congress
has
prescribed,
then
it's
for
congress
to
enlarge
the
time.
here,
seven
months
elapsed
during
which
the
commission
investigated
and
re-investigated.during
which
they
asked
for
information
and
more
information.
during
which
they
notified
and
re-notified
the
department
of
justice.
if
that
seven-month
period
and
if
the
time
allowed
for
appeal
is
inadequate
for
the
department
of
justice
not
to
attack
any
general
conspiracy,
i'm
going
to
get
to
that.
but
to
attack
this
very
transaction,
then
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
is
for
congress
to
say
that
the
time
shall
be
enlarged.
i
may
say
to
you
that
i
think
the
department
of
justice
had
more
than
adequate
time
and
subsequent
events
have
so
demonstrated.
and
while
i'm
on
that
question,
i
may
ask
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
which
was
followed
up
by
another
question
from
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
whether
the
position
of
the
department
was
made
known
to
the
apellees
and
mr.
justice
stewart
followed
that
up
by
asking
whom
did
the
government
tell?
well,
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas
is
“no”
and
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
is
“nobody.”
actually,
when
11
months
after
the
department
has
been
notified
that
they
were
antitrust
issues,
it
instituted
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
nobody
could
have
been
more
surprised
than
we
were.
we
had
no
prior
knowledge
of
any
kind
that
that
proceeding
would
be
called
or
that
that
proceeding
would
be
forthcoming.
we
were
going
likely
on
our
way
in
the
belief
that
in
investing
millions
of
additional
dollars
to
put
in
colored
television
and
all
else
that
was
done
in
philadelphia,
we
were
doing
so
with
the
greatest
security
that
a
party
could
have,
a
licensee
could
have
a
license
from
the
agencies
setup
by
congress.
the
license,
the
very
transaction
which
the
federal
communications
commission
did
license
and
i'll
just
get
to
one
other
matter
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
sure.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
--
it
does
not,
except
it
does
show
that
we
did
take
over
the
philadelphia
stations
in
reliance
that
they
did
take
over
to
cleveland
and
somewhere
in
the
interrogatories
that
were
printed
which
i
hesitate
to
ask
--
as
to
refer
to
because
i
don't
think
they
were
properly
printed.
it
does
refer
to
the
fact
that
a
great
many
people
were
uprooted
from
one
city
and
transferred
to
another.
but
except
as
its
common
knowledge
of
what
was
done
in
philadelphia,
the
colored
television
and
all
else,
it's
not
in
this
record.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
here
--
here,
and
i'll
come
to
it
a
little
more
fully,
but
here,
we're
acting
on
a
federal
communications
commission
determination
and
the
stipulation
of
states.
we
just
completely
overturned
the
situation.
we're
operating
--
cleveland
station
ceased
to
operate
them,
terminated
all
our
contracts,
gave
up
all
our
connections,
took
whatever
employees
were
involved
and
went
to
philadelphia.
westinghouse
did
--
did
just
the
reverse
and
all
of
these
was
permitted
to
go
on
for
close
to
a
year
before
the
department
of
justice
first
brought
it
suit.
and
even
if
we
--
it
might
as
well,
you
might
say
three
or
four
years
because,
obviously
we
couldn't
then
undo
it
merely
because
a
suit
was
brought.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
we
started
making
the
transfer
as
the
stipulation
states,
your
honor,
when
the
appeal
period
had
elapsed.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
i
may
say
further
that
under
the
order,
we
had
to
do
it
within
15
days
thereafter,
because
the
order
gives
you
45
days
within
which
to
do
it.
and
i
presume
the
reason
is
that
30
days
is
the
appeal
period
and
they
allow
you
15
more
days
to
act
after
the
appeal
period
has
gone
by.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
we
really
considered
it,
your
honor,
not
of
much
significance.
all
that
commissioner
doerfer
said
was
that
this
wouldn't
bar
an
overall
look.
in
other
words,
that
the
fact
did
approve,
this
transfer
wouldn't
bar
the
commission
or
the
department
of
justice
from
looking
into
the
question
of
whether
generally,
the
--
the
nbc
was
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
you
see,
he
started
by
saying
it's
difficult
to
see
how
approvals
and
preclude
others
from
examining
into
the
transaction.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
he
says
that.
and
then
he
says
that
such
an
overall
look
is
still
available
for
the
fcc
or
any
other
governmental
agency.
now,
if
what
he
meant
was
that
after
the
commission,
as
i
hope
you
shall
decide
that
this
is
in
the
public
interest.
this
very
transaction
and
therefore
i
think
inevitably
decide
that
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
anyone
can
come
along
and
say
this,
“i
think
he
was
wrong.”
to
the
extent
that
he
means
that
this
gives
us
no
immunity,
gives
us
no
exemption
so
that
conduct
by
us
in
operating
under
the
license
or
conduct
that
wasn't
an
issue
here
can
permit
an
overall
look
and
he
says,
“i
think
it
was
loose
language,
can
permit
an
overall
look.”
i
think
he's
right
and
i
shall
so
argue.
so,
that
this
gave
us
no
concern.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
may
say
your
honor
that
we
saw
nothing
to
take
up
and
i
still
think
that
is
true.
what
he
said
was
not
shocking
and
except
for
a
little
loose
language,
was
--
was
probably
very
good
law
as
i
shall
show.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
the
dissenter
took
the
position
he
feared
that
the
government
could
not
bring
it.
he
feared
the
--
the
--
commissioner
bartley
said
that
his
fear
was
that
this
would
forestall
the
government.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
was
the
only
dissent.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
not
--
not
that
there
might
be
a
violation,
the
only
question
was,
“would
this
bar
the
government?”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
have
to
read
his
mind.
but
certainly,
commissioner
doerfer
couldn't
have
been
more
categorical
within
the
portion
i
read
to
your
honors
in
saying
that
there
wasn't
as
he
said,
a
scintilla
of
evidence
of
any
such
and
he
had
everything
the
department
of
justice
had.
now,
this
present
suit,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
your
honors.
your
honors
will
remember
that
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
issue
in
a
sherman
act
case
is
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
whether
the
defendants
acted
in
pursuance
of
the
conspiracy.
and
in
answer
to
a
question,
i
think
for
mr.
justice
black,
he
said
that
if
there
wasn't,
then
he
thought
this
case
fell
out.
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
ask
your
honors
whether
you
would
turn
to
the
complaint,
because
after
all,
that
does
define
the
issues.
and
i
ask
your
honors
to
look
first
at
paragraph
21
at
page
7.
and
there
we
find
what
i
think
is
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
it
complains
that
on
a
certain
day,
may
16th,
1955,
a
month
by
the
way
before
the
applications
were
filed,
defendant
nbc
entered
into
a
contract
with
wbc
in
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
and
commerce
in
violation
of
section
1
and
he
tells
what
the
contract
provided
for.
so,
the
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
alleged
in
what
is
the
gravamen
in
the
complaint
is
the
very
contract
that's
authorized
here.
now,
i'll
come
in
a
minute
to
a
vague
allegation
of
general
conspiracy,
but
first
i'd
like
to
fix
your
honors'
attention
if
i
may
on
that.
might
i
ask
you
then
to
go
to
23
where
he
gives
the
effects
of
all
of
the
offenses?
the
effects,
which
i
take
it
is
the
critical
question
of
what
was
the
result
of
this
conspiracy,
what
did
it
do?
and
without
burdening
your
honors,
i
say
that
every
single
effect
related
solely
and
exclusively
to
this
exchange
transaction,
(a)
“reduce
the
ability
of
who?”
wbc,
(b)
“to
preclude
competition
where?”
in
the
philadelphia
market,
(c)
“to
preclude
competition
where?”
in
the
philadelphia
market,
(d)
“to
reduce
the
ability
of
who?”
westinghouse
electric.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
what
--
couldn't
mean
anywhere.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
i
may
say
there
your
honor,
it
couldn't
mean
anything,
except
in
the
philadelphia
market
because
it
was
in
the
sale
of
equipment.
and
obviously,
the
only
effect
was
that
in
philadelphia,
as
they
--
as
the
government
contends,
maybe
nbc
would
advertise
rca
products
more
than
it
would
westinghouse's
products.
and
it
couldn't
possibly
affect
san
francisco
for
instance,
where
we
have
an
affiliate.there's
no
such
allegation
of
any
kind.
the
allegation
is
directly
that
maybe
this
exchange
transaction,
the
fact
that
we,
instead
of
westinghouse
owned
a
station
in
philadelphia,
would
have
these
effects.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'm
going
to
come
to
those
if
i
may
your
honor,
if
i
may
just
for
a
moment
--
as
i
said,
i
want
to
get
to
this
general
conspiracy,
but
we
take
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
--
well,
that's
18
and
19.
they
do.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
what
did
you
say?
yes,
i'm
going
to
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
i
just
--
if
i
may
just
say
about
this
one,
that
the
relief
requested
under
--
and
i'm
going
to
come
if
i
may
in
just
a
half
a
minute
your
honor.
in
21
and
23,
the
relief
requested
by
the
government
is
that
the
district
court
ordered
the
revocation
of
the
philadelphia
licenses
and
that
the
district
court
ordered
the
divestiture
of
the
philadelphia
station.
so
that
its
relief
on
21
and
23,
different
from
the
relief
that
i'm
going
to
come
to,
mr.
justice
black,
on
the
two
averments
that
you
referred
to.
its
--
its
question
there
is
--
its
relief
there
is
order
them
to
get
rid
of
the
license
the
fcc
granted.order
them
to
give
up
the
stations
which
they
acquired
in
the
exchange
agreement
that
the
fcc
approved.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
why,
what
isn't?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
because
we
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
your
honor
in
the
first
place,
to
the
extent
--
to
the
extent
that
they
allege
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
acquire
this
station,
that
was
all
gone
into
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
all
the
federal
communications
commission
went
in,
in
the
quotation
i
read
from
your
honors.
“was
there
coercion?
did
they
use
these
methods?
did
they
illegally
use
power?”
and
the
commission
getting
extensive
evidence
on
that
question
concluded
as
commissioner
doerfer
says
that
there
wasn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence,
that
there
was
illegal
coercion
or
that
rca
or
nbc
exercised
coercion
on
westinghouse
incidentally,
a
much
greater
and
more
powerful,
both
in
size
and
wealth
corporation.
and
commissioner
doerfer
says
it's
just
is
no
evidence.
now,
they
passed
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
even
unrelated
to
this
one.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
they
didn't
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
this
--
we
have
a
stip
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
we
have
a
stipulation
here
that
every
fact
pertaining
to
every
antitrust
issue
which
the
department
of
justice
now
has,
the
federal
communications
commission
had
at
the
time
it
decided,
this
case
is
nothing
new.
there's
no
general
conspiracy
of
a
nature
that
doesn't
relate
to
this
particular
transaction.
it
all
relates
to
this
transaction,
this
is
the
conspiracy
they
allege.
this
is
the
conspiracy
to
get
this
philadelphia
station.
now,
the
fcc
passed
on
that
necessarily.
this
was
what
it
had
presented
to
it
in
the
form
of
testimony.
and
having
had
it
presented
to
it
in
the
form
of
testimony,
the
federal
communications
commission
said
“no,
we
conclude
that
there
isn't
anything
conspiratorial
here.
we
see
nothing
improper.
we
find
no
coercion
such
as
might
possibly
be
charged,
then
we
therefore
find
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
and
therefore
necessarily
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
for
them
to
own
this
particular
station
and
operate
it
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.”
now,
the
--
the
fundamental
proposition
of
what
we
say
here
your
honor
is,
that
when
the
fcc
determines
that
a
transaction
is
in
the
public
interest,
meets
the
standard
of
public
interest
which
is
the
primary
function
which
the
congress
gave
to
the
federal
communications
commission.
what
is
its
primary
function
here?
to
license
people
and
to
license
them,
how?
to
license
them
if
they
meet
the
public
standard.
now,
that
is
the
keystone,
that's
the
keystone
of
the
system
and
having
created
the
federal
communications
commission
to
make
that
finding,
we
then
come
to
the
question
of
what
does
the
finding
entail?
we
think
that
basically,
the
public
interest
must
encompass
the
basic
economic
policy
of
the
united
states,
namely
the
antitrust
laws.
and
that's
what
judge
kirkpatrick
found.
he
said
there's
no
doubt
whatever
that
in
finding
this
was
in
the
public
interest,
his
language
was,
if
the
fcc
necessarily
decided
that
the
exchange
did
not
involve
a
violation
of
the
law
which
declares
and
implement
a
basic
economic
policy
of
the
united
states
but
we
go
further
than
that,
that
would
be
true
if
not
for
section
313.
but
here,
in
the
very
communications
act
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
we
find
section
313
which
appears
at
page
5
of
the
brief
of
the
government
which
says
that,
“all
laws
of
the
united
states
relating
to
one
lawful
restraints,
monopolies,
combinations
and
so
on
are
hereby
declared
to
be
applicable
to
the
manufacturer,
to
the
interstate
or
foreign
radio
communications.
so
we
have
not
only
the
general
law
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
be
imported
into
the
determination
of
public
interest,
but
we
have
a
mandate
in
the
communications
act
from
congress
to
the
federal
communications
commission
that
when
it
decides
the
things
in
the
public
interest,
it
cannot
decide
so,
if
that
particular
transaction
which
it
is
approving
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
i
take
it
that
in
inevitable
corollary
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions
of
your
honors
is
that
the
federal
communications
commission
cannot
license
an
act
or
a
transaction
which
itself
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
if
it
did,
then
whether
with
the
department
of
justice
or
a
party
in
interest
who
isn't
protested,
that
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
court
would
strike
it
down
as
being
outside
the
power
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
my
position
would
be
that
it
would
be
an
invalid
suit,
one
that
could
not
be
brought
because
its
endeavored
to
strike
down
after
the
--
you
say
the
day
after
the
order?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh
i
have
no
doubt.
we
would
have
been
put
to
a
hearing
and
we
couldn't
have
objected
to
it.
no
doubt
whatever.
if
it
did
after
the
order,
your
honor,
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
commission
could
then
have
granted
a
hearing
and
we
would
have
been
put
to
a
full
dress
proceeding
there
as
to
whether
this
should
or
shouldn't
be
granted,
subject
to
appellate
review
to
the
district
court,
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
certiorari
to
this
court.
no
doubt
in
my
mind
whatever.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
if
they
had
brought
it
in
the
district
court,
your
honor
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
we
would
have
come
here
and
we
would
have
said
that
your
honors
decisions
in
the
far
east
and
in
cunard
and
in
the
whole
line
of
cases
starting
with
abilene
and
chief
justice
white
50
years
ago,
would
require
that
that
suit
be
set
aside
and
that
it'd
be
tried
before
the
federal
communications
commission
if
this
had
happened
before.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
meant
before
the
fcc,
then
my
answer
would
be
that
i
gave
the
chief
justice
that
under
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrines,
this
case
would
have
had
to
go
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
court
would
have
said
as
this
court
has
many
times
said
before
with
respect
to
many
regulatory
bodies,
you
go
to
the
commission
and
try
your
case
there.
and
the
department
of
justice
couldn't
have
said,
“it
isn't
our
practice
to
try
such
cases
because
at
that
very
time,
they
would
have
been
engaged
in
(inaudible)
case
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
arguing
that
the
dual
rate
setup
was
invalid
because
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
if
it
was
the
day
after
the
order,
it
would
be
the
same.
but
if
it
was
the
day
after
the
last
day
for
appeal,
then
my
answer
would
be
what
it
is
today.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
it
would
be
exactly
the
same.
exactly
the
same.
because
your
honor
--
because
mr.
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
what
the
stipulation
demonstrates,
your
honor,
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
say
the
district
court
couldn't
entertain
a
suit
because
the
stipulation
makes
clear
that
the
department
of
justice
would
then
have
a
--
had
a
complete
remedy
even
at
that
time
before
the
federal
communications
commission.
it
clarifies
the
right
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
or
it
--
or
confirms.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
no.
i
think
if
--
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
by
any
chance
the
department
of
justice
and
we
were
wrong
and
they
didn't
have
the
rights
that
the
stipulation
says
they
had,
the
stipulation
couldn't
give
it
to
them.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
that
isn't
our
case
of
course
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
and
it's
a
more
difficult
case
but
my
answer
would
be
the
same.
my
answer
would
be
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
that
it
was
for
congress
to
prescribe
whether
--
once
the
federal
communications
commission
acted
and
approved
the
pleadings,
the
condition
is
under
which
anyone
else
could
act
to
set
aside
that
very
transaction
with
no
new
facts.
now,
of
course
if
they
discovered
new
facts,
they
would
have
had
a
right
to
go
to
the
federal
communications
commission
on
the
usual
principles
of
that,
the
discovered
evidence.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
because
they
had
a
right
of
revocation.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
assuming,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
facts
here
that
there
were
no
new
facts
and
no
new
issues
and
they
discovered
nothing
that
the
fcc
didn't
have,
i
think
that's
true.
and
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that
it
doesn't
shock
me
at
all.
this
is
what
congress
said
the
federal
communications
commission
up
to
do.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
is
true
that
some
agencies
of
government
don't
have
all
the
knowledge
that
some
other
agencies
had
in
a
particular
transaction.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
suggest
to
your
honor
it
wasn't
adversary
because
there
was
nothing
improper
about
it.
if
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
i
think
the
question
involved
here
is
whether
that
hasn't
been
decided,
whether
we
aren't
passed
the
time
to
decide
whether
there
was
anything
improper.
the
commission
has
decided
there's
nothing
improper
and
i
submit
to
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
commission
having
decided
it,
no
one
else
can
again
say
that.
that's
precisely
what
i
mean
in
saying
that
it's
not
now
to
be
decided
whether
there
was
anything
improper,
the
--
the
time
to
have
decided
that
was
one
that
was
before
the
commission.
and
if
that's
wrong,
it's
for
congress
to
change
it.
and
i
may
say
i
doubt
whether
congress
would
ever
hold
that
a
finding
by
the
commission
after
thorough
investigation
just
because
nobody
protested.
what
it
would
mean,
your
honor,
would
be
that
if
the
matter
were
one
in
which
nobody
protested
and
there
are
plenty
of
potential
or
possible
protest.
every
other
station
in
philadelphia
could
have
protested
if
this
were
monopolization
or
if
this
were
improper
or
if
nbc
were
predatory.
there's
not
a
scintilla
predatory
practices
charged
in
this
case.
now,
if
that
had
happened,
then
the
fcc
would
have
decided
if
they
couldn't
grant
the
permit,
the
license,
your
honor,
they
couldn't
grant
the
license
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
it
was
raised
here,
mr.
--
commissioner
doerfer
went
into
at
length
in
his
opinion.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
and
your
honor
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
we
have
a
stipulation.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
i
don't
think
that
it's
very
important.
the
adverse
party
there
was
the
broadcast
bureau,
the
investigating
arm
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
this
is
how
congress
wanted
it.
and
--
and
we
have
a
stipulation
here
that
every
antitrust
issue
in
the
complaint
was
considered
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
this
isn't
a
case
where
a
new
issue
has
risen
or
a
new
fact.
this
is
to
me
an
ipso
facto
case.
we
can
imagine
more
difficult
ones
but
they're
not
present
in
this
situation,
mr.
chief
justice.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
sure,
that's
your
honors
decision.
that's
your
honors
decision
in
far
east
and
in
cunard,
starting
way
back
in
abilene.
they've
got
to
wait
to
see
what
the
administrative
agency
does.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
general
antitrust
case?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
sure.
that
i
wanted
to
come
to
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
i
think
they
could
include
allegations
about
it.
let
me
--
let
me
just
say
to
your
honor
what
313
means
because
it's
been
referred
to,
and
that
is
the
provision
which
gives
the
department
of
justice
the
right
to
go
to
a
court
to
ask
for
an
injunction
or
to
ask
for
an
order
that
the
license
be
revoked.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
said
in
view
of
--
in
view
of
that
section
313
and
i
refer
to
the
provision
that
mr.
justice
harlan
went
into
with
the
solicitor
general,
whenever
in
any
antitrust
suit
a
licensee
is
involved,
the
court
has
the
right
to
--
as
one
of
the
penalties,
an
additional
--
additional
penalty
to
ask
for
revocation.
for
that,
it
seems
to
me
not
at
all
out
of
line
with
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
suppose
for
example,
the
nbc
had
entered
into
an
agreement
with
general
motors,
that
if
general
motors
would
use
no
other
media
for
advertising,
nbc
would
not
permit
ford
and
chrysler
to
use
the
nbc
philadelphia
station.
and
suppose
the
government
brought
an
antitrust
suit
not
a
doubt
in
the
world,
it
can
revoke
this
license
under
section
313.
but
in
ordering
the
revocation
of
the
license,
it's
not
doing
it.
it's
not
ordering
it
on
the
basis
that
a
transaction
which
the
fcc
approved
on
no
new
facts
was
invalid.
there's
nothing
here
which
gives
nbc
an
immunity
or
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
all
we
have
is
and
all
our
narrow
issue
is
that
once
the
commission
has
approved
a
specific
transaction,
the
government
can't
come
along
and
ask
that
that
transaction
be
declared
null
and
void
and
particularly
whereas
here,
it's
on
the
same
questions.
but
if
nbc
misuses
its
license,
then
the
government
can
certainly
come
along
and
ask
for
its
revocation.
now,
i
want
to
get
into
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
mr.
justice
black's
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
go
as
far
as
saying
--
well
i
--
i
--
it's
a
little
difficult,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
would
say
if
the
facts
were
the
same,
yes,
the
conclusion
would
be
the
same.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
now,
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
if
their
purpose
was
to
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
undo
this
transaction?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i'd
say
no
other
government
agency
can
undo
what
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
would
depend
what
the
purpose
was,
the
fcc
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
wouldn't
bar
the
government
from
bringing
any
lawsuit
involving
nbc
in
any
antitrust
violation
if
the
purpose
of
the
lawsuit
were
not
to
have
declared
null
and
void
what
the
federal
communications
commission
had
advertently
authorized.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
i
--
i
had
said,
mr.
justice
black
that
in
the
case
of
a
suit
to
prevent
the
granting
of
this
license
or
to
prevent
the
acquisition
of
this
station
by
nbc
that
primary
jurisdiction
rules
would
have
required
that
that
be
sent
to
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
rules
of
this
court
i
take
it
are
very
clear
on
that.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
is
correct,
where
the
remedy
is
not
the
remedy
sought
in
the
communications.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
the
remedies
are
different
then
the
suit
would
not
be
barred.
now
i'd
like
to
address
myself,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
the
paragraph
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
would
be
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
depends
on
what
they
are
saying
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
well
the
same
kind
of
conduct
is
too
broad,
your
honor.
if
the
purpose
of
the
suit
was
as
it
is
here,
to
force
them
to
divest
themselves
of
this
station,
the
validity
of
the
acquisition
of
which
was
before
the
federal
communications
commission.
then
the
federal
communications
commission
had
primary
jurisdiction
over
the
court
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it's
just
the
same
as
the
dual
rate
case,
your
honor.
they
ask
that
the
dual
rate
be
declared
illegal.
and
they
said,
“oh
no,
you've
got
to
first
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decide
whether
the
dual
rate
is
or
isn't
illegal.”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
there
are
no
other
remedies
asked
here
except
one
that
i'd
like
to
get
to
before
my
time
is
up
because
it
adverts
to
a
very
important
question
your
honor
asked
me.
you
asked
about
paragraph
18
or
19
--
and
19.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
now,
i'd
like
to
talk
more
about
that
but
i
must
be
brief
because
i
have
just
a
few
minutes.
paragraph
18
and
19
in
effect
say
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
by
nbc
now
having
as
--
as
from
the
broadcasting
system
has.
the
--
i
said
i'm
going
to
answer
very
briefly,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
i
thank
your
honors,
that's
very
gracious.
that
will
enable
me
to
cover
the
point
a
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--
little
more
thoroughly.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
mr.
justice
black
asked
in
paragraphs
18
and
19
where
it
is
charged
that
there
was
a
combination
or
conspiracy
as
a
continuing
agreement
and
concert
of
action.
to
do
what?
the
continuing
conspiracy
is
to
obtain
vhf
television
station
ownership
in
five
of
the
eight
primary
markets.
now,
we
now
have
them
in
four.
and
therefore,
what
the
commission
says
is
that
there's
a
continuing
conspiracy
for
us
to
better
the
washington
station
to
see
if
we
can't
get
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
or
seventh
or
eighth
market
instead
of
washington.
well,
i
leave
the
question
of
whether
to
washingtonians
that
would
seem
to
be
a
desirable
change
as
commissioner
doerfer
says
mere
sales
volume
isn't
the
only
consideration.but
assuming
it
were,
what
could
happen?
what
could
happen
if
the
nbc
decided
that
it
wanted
to
acquire
another
station,
it
would
have
to
go
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
file
an
application.
and
when
it
filed
its
application,
if
the
department
of
justice
thought
there
was
anything
predatory
about
its
acquisition,
it
could
do
there
what
it
could
have
done
here.
there
isn't
anything
and
what
relief
by
the
way
does
the
department
of
justice
asked
for
this
so-called
conspiracy
to
get
another
better
station
than
washington?
they
can't
have
more
than
five
under
the
federal
communications
regulations.
so
if
they
give
up
--
if
they
acquire
one,
they
got
to
give
up
washington.
now,
suppose
that
happens,
what
does
the
department
say?
the
department
wants
the
united
states
district
court
in
spite
of
this
extensive
system
that
has
been
setup
by
the
congress
for
the
regulation
and
licensing
of
its
industry
to
issue
a
decree
that
before
nbc
could
acquire
a
station
in
this
other
city,
it
must
get
the
authority
of
the
fcc
now.
it
must
get
the
authority
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
if
it
wants
to
get
a
station
in
san
francisco,
if
it
wants
to
get
one
in
boston
or
detroit,
which
are
the
cities
involved.does
it
go
to
the
fcc?
oh
no.
that
authority
as
you
said
if
the
government
has
its
way,
it
goes
to
the
united
states
district
court.
and
it
says
to
the
united
states
district
court,
“won't
you
please
approve
my
acquisition
in
san
francisco?”
well,
i
state
to
your
honors
with
full
deference
that
the
statement
of
the
remedy
which
is
sought
in
the
complaint
is
as
much
of
an
indictment
as
a
statement
of
the
complaint
itself.
this
is
all
part
and
parcel
of
what
was
before
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
federal
communications
commission
investigation
related
to
whether
there
was
such
an
attempt
by
nbc
to
better
its
position
in
two
markets.
whether
the
philadelphia
acquisition
was
part
of
that
program
and
they
said,
“no,
there
is
no
such
predatory
motive.
there
is
no
such
predatory
practice
and
we
therefore
approve
the
acquisition
of
the
philadelphia
station.”
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
if
your
honors
please,
that
not
only
is
the
first
purpose
of
the
department
of
justice
which
is
to
have
the
united
states
district
court
strike
down
as
invalid
what
the
fcc
has
advertently
approved
with
no
new
evidence,
no
new
facts,
no
new
issues,
no
new
anti-trust
issues.
but
it's
second
objective
which
is
to
have
this
court
see
it
as
a
kind
of
super
economic
tribunal
in
place
of
the
fcc
could
decide
whether
they
shall
acquire
is
even
more
shocking
than
the
first
objective.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
prayer
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
your
honor,
if
you
will
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
if
you
will
just
look
at
page
10
of
the
brief
of
the
government
your
honor.
they
have
in
their
depositions
in
their
interrogatories
enlarged
what
they
mean
by
other
relief.
and
it's
here
on
page
10
at
the
top,
the
government's
brief,
the
bottom
of
page
9
says,
“the
relief
requested
was
--”
and
then
they
have
--
that
you
--
you
have
it
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
“require
nbc
to
divest,
revoke
the
license
met
justifully
and
require
judicial
approval
of
any
further
--”
it
says,
“acquisitions”
but
it
can't
mean
that
because
there
can
only
be
one
acquisition.
because
both
columbia
broadcasting
and
nbc
have
stations
in
the
first,
second
and
third
and
fourth
markets.
so
this
involves
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
i
think
it's
over
enthusiastic
drawing
with
the
complaint
if
i
may
suggest
it
your
honor.
now,
i
want
to
say
to
your
honors
on
the
one
point,
incidentally,
all
313
does
is
that
here's
an
additional
penalty
in
an
ordinary
antitrust
suit
that
creates
no
new
right,
it
creates
no
new
cause
of
action.
it
says
that
if
a
broadcasting
company
is
involved,
then
the
government
can
impose
an
additional
penalty.
i
haven't
had
much
time
your
honors
to
talk
about
the
equitable
considerations.
it
seems
to
me
apparent
that
the
strong
arm
of
the
government
should
not
be
permitted
to
be
raised
with
a
view
to
striking
down
what
another
branch
of
the
government
has
expressly
approved
than
all
the
more
in
this
case
where
it
has
conceded
that
they
had
full
notice,
full
opportunity
and
that
there
are
no
new
facts,
no
new
issues,
no
new
consideration
of
any
kind.
the
answer
to
the
question
one
of
the
justices
asked
as
to
whether
there
are
cases
where
the
government
has
been
held
to
be
accountable
to
follow
the
equitable
considerations
of
other
litigants
is
in
the
affirmative
and
by
the
dozens.
when
the
government
invokes
the
aide
of
an
equity
court,
as
justice
holmes
or
wells
said,
“it
so
forth
takes
the
position
of
a
private
suitor,
is
to
be
bound
by
the
same
rules
of
equity
and
equitable
consideration
as
the
private
suitor.”
i
--
i
say
with
full
deference
to
the
department
of
justice
your
honors,
that
one
of
the
great
functions
of
our
courts
is
to
protect
the
citizens
against
excesses
of
government
and
the
overzealousness
of
its
officials.
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
held
and
will
hold
that
this
is
true
not
only
when
the
issue
is
the
sacred
civil
rights
of
individuals,
but
i
think
it's
true
too
where
the
simplest
fundamentals
of
fair
play
to
corporate
enterprise
is
involved.
i
thank
your
honors
for
the
additional
time.
