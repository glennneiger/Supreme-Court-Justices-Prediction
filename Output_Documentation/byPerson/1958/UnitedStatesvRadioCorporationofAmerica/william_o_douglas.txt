justice
william
o.
douglas
would
you
mind
telling
what
happened
before
the
commission?
justice
william
o.
douglas
did
the
department
of
justice
appear
that
the
administrative
proceedings
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
[laughs]
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
would
contend
that
it
was
not
binding
upon
the
department
of
justice
insofar
as
an
action
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
is
concerned,
because
they
are
not
required
under
the
law.
and
they
aren't
expected
under
the
law
to
determine
that
question
except
for
a
limited
purpose
of
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
now,
they
held
no
hearing
in
this
matter.
and
rca,
the
other
conspirator
was
not
a
party.
is
it
conceived
for
a
moment
that
if
the
commission
had
held
against
them
on
the
antitrust
and
made
such
a
finding
that
it
could
bind
rca,
who
was
not
a
party
in
the
action,
and
the
government
was
not
a
party,
in
such
a
later
proceeding,
wouldn't
the
rca
say,
"we
had
no
trial.
we
had
no
hearing
on
this
section
1.
we'll
be
involved
at
all
kinds
of
trouble
damage
actions
in
relation
to
this
matter
by
such
a
holding.
we're
entitled
to
a
trial
under
section
1
in
the
courts
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
we
did
or
did
not
violate
these
antitrust
laws.
and
the
incidental
feature
of
the
effect
of
the
antitrust
relationship
on
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
certainly
cannot
bind
us,
and
preclude
us
from
a
proper
hearing
in
the
court
of
law
on
the
other
issue.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
if
the
commission
had
made
explicit
findings
here
at
least
we
can
find
that
this
did
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
we'd
be
here
--
not
here
then?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
--
but
it
was
--
its
purpose
for
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
kind
--
what
kind
of
violation
were
they
talking
about?
we're
talking
here
about
the
violation
as
to
--
is
inherent
in
the
things
that
the
commission
grants
the
licensee,
the
monopoly,
are
we
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
they
went
up
on
--
on
a
402
case
in
the
court
--
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
opposition
could
get
a
reversal
on
it
definitely.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
say
not
this
one
but
the
second
case,
where
there's
an
adversary.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
if
the
department
of
justice
had
intervened,
it
would
make
yourself
a
party,
do
you
think?
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
suppose
there
had
been,
then
that
could
have
been
the
judgment
--
the
decision
could
be
reversed
on
--
on
that
ground,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
your
argument
mean
that
private
treble
damages
suits
could
also
be
brought?
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
of
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
conspiracy,
yes.
