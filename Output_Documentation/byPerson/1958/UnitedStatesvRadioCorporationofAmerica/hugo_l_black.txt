justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
found,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
and
the
other
company
had
been
there,
could
the
person
who
claimed
to
have
self-examined
on
account
of
this
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
take
advantage
of
the
statute
authorizes
them
where
the
court
finds
guilt
to
use
that
as
prima
facie?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
have
been
a
finding
of
innocence
by
the
--
by
the
commission,
finding
there
was
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
law,
and
a
suit
had
been
filed
by
some
person
who
claims
under
civil
suits
or
some
--
claims
of
an
injured,
could
that
finding
be
set-up
either
as
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
or
anything
else?
or
as
to
civil
damage
suit
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
the
other
parties
take
that
position?
i'm
not
talking
about
your
position
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
discussed
what
would
happen
in
a
case
of
a
civil
action
for
damages
by
someone
who
claims
had
been
injured,
should
there
be
a
plea
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it's
a
legal
adjudication,
i
suppose
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question,
practical
--
of
the
practical
effect.
you're
prepared
to
answer
it.
suppose
it
is
true
that
this
adjudication,
it's
finding
either
of
guilt
or
innocence,
and
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
therefore
in
order
to
determine
it,
you'd
have
to
have
a
full-fledged
trial
of
all
the
evidence
relating
to
reasonableness
and
so
forth,
so
far
as
antitrust
charge
is
concerned.
would
that
have
any
appreciable
effect
on
the
length
of
time
required
to
pass
on
this
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
--
does
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
have
any
connection
with
the
proceedings,
if
it
has
that
effect?
is
a
defendant
charged
with
violating
antitrust
laws
other
than
federal
courts,
a
trial
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
mr.
solicitor
general
that
if
it
be
correct
that
this
is
a
--
an
adjudication,
a
final
adjudication
or
you're
barred
on
the
same
basic
principle
by
estoppel,
what
do
you
call
the
estoppel
in
pais
or
collateral
or
whatever
it
is?
i
suppose
what
you're
barred
and
once
you
--
the
scope
of
the
judgement
would
be
if
there
is
one
that's
binding,
that
there's
no
conspiracy
between
these
two
companies
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
suppose
you
try
to
indict
both
of
them
or
one
of
them,
why
couldn't
both
of
them
plead
this
as
a
defense?
it
would
be
a
final
adjudication
if
it
is
one
of
the
fact
that
neither
one
is
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
not
merely
that
company
but
the
other
one
too,
i
would
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
merely
--
if
only
one
of
them
however,
had
been
indicted
here
before,
let's
take
the
court
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
only
one
of
them
had
been
indicted.
and
on
the
ground
that
he
can
file
that
a
had
conspired
with
b.
but
b
wasn't
indicted.
and
they
--
the
court
and
jury
found
a
innocent.
could
b
be
prosecuted
after
that?
b
wasn't
party
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
think
of
--
can
you
give
a
reason
in
your
own
mind
or
situation
in
which
they
could
have
found
that
this
violated
the
antitrust
act
on
--
based
on
substantial
evidence
in
which
it
could
be
said
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
let
them
violate
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
making
--
are
you
making
a
mistake
in
talking
about
the
competitive
factor,
and
making
it
wholly
and
completely
synonymous
proven
violation
of
the
law
both
criminal
and
civil.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
this
entails
to
take
that
position
that
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
law
clearly
shown,
violation
of
antitrust
law,
which
is
not
unanimous,
that
they
could
be
granted
a
license.
have
you
any
other
argument
besides
the
one
based
on
the
premise
of
the
violation
of
the
law
and
need
not
bother?
is
there
--
do
argue
--
you
make
any
argument
in
connection
with
the
nature
of
the
case,
this
being
an
answer
for
everything?
it
may
be
the
proof
but
different
to
what
it
would
be,
if
criminal
or
civil
case,
but
to
keep
issue
as
the
antitrust
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
not
talking
about
that
proof.
i'm
talking
about
the
case
before
the
commission.
is
it
--
suppose
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
which
is
that
--
the
commission
just
said
we're
not
going
to
take
three
months
to
try
this
--
all
this
case,
this
was
not
the
end
of
it.
lead
us
close
enough
to
believe
that
this
is
on
the
line
of
violating
the
antitrust
law.
that
we're
just
going
to
consider
it
for
the
purposes
here
that
we'll
go
no
further.
that
we
will
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
up
to
this
time
without
drawing
into
it
fully
we
believe
the
antitrust
law
has
been
violated.could
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
that
is
to
see
--
what's
your
position.
suppose
the
evidence
showed
that
finding
made
that
during
this
11
months
had
been
many
new
things
done,
new
actions
taken
in
a
great
extent
so
that
it
could
be
established
a
substantial
evidence
that
big
thing,
whatever
it
is.
the
irreparable
damages
is
has
been
suffered
--
would
be
suffered
if
--
because
of
what
is
done
within
this
11
months,
you
try
to
unscramble
this
thing.
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
your
basic
contention
is
--
i'm
having
--
only
see
if
i'm
rather
wrong.
not
that
you
could
not
be
estopped
as
he
said
or
barred
by
a
reason
of
sitting
by
and
letting
people
take
steps
upon
them
into
great
distress
and
trouble
and
so
forth.
but
that
there
is
nothing
here
that
shows
that
any
such
situation
existed.
there
are
no
findings
to
show
us
and
no
justification
into
all
these
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
tried
any
cases
that
hold
or
how
they
held
if
the
government
cannot
be
estopped
by
it's
vagueness
for
that
being
in
a
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
you
ask
the
commission
to
hold
up
by
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
the
stipulation
as
to
the
duty
of
the
commission
under
the
statute
is
binding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
cannot
then
rely
on
special
circumstances
to
show
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you're
entitled
to
have
to
say
that
there
was
some
kind
of
estoppel
or
laches
or
something.
it
has
to
be
on
the
basis
of
what
was
actually
done
and
deprive
to
all
other
cases
in
both
special
circumstances
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
they
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
18,
19
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
general
conspiracy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
began
in
54
and
continued.
justice
hugo
l.
black
began
in
54
and
continued.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
could
they
not
do
that?
i've
got
all
the
references
but
i
don't
quite
get
why
they
do
not
find
it
reviewable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
not
alright
for
them
to
order
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
if
it
was
true
that
a
year
or
two
before,
they
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
that
violates
the
law,
then
this
could
be
means
--
views
of
the
means
to
carry
out
it
through.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
was
--
suppose
--
suppose
there
was
no
question
here
about
how
they
got
registration.
would
be
alright,
they
get
it,
everybody
knew
this.
but
the
government
came
in
and
said
that
two
years
before
they
come
to
that
decision.
can
a
conspiracy
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
because
they
found
there
had
been
one?
why
--
why
would
they
not
have
some
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
required
to
give
it
up
if
it
was
to
be
used
as
a
means
for
carrying
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
conspiracy
which
they
found
has
begun
long
before
this
thing
is
served.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
what
they
allege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
should
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
the
government
had
filed
a
suit
for
violating
the
antitrust
act,
while
this
was
pending,
they
could
not
have
tried
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
they
wanted
to
try
just
this
antitrust
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
connection
with
that
question,
you
wouldn't
say
would
you
that
if
an
action
is
pending
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
court
--
the
government
would
be
barred
from
going
into
federal
court
to
prosecute,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
undoing,
i'm
talking
about
filling
at
the
same
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
the
fcc
--
the
federal
trade
commission
was
--
they
charge
them
with
violating
the
antitrust
action,
in
fact
in
a
certain
way
and
they
file
a
lawsuit
which
charge
them
in
violating
in
the
same
way
with
the
fact
that
the
proceeding
started
and
the
federal
trade
commission
barred
the
government
from
that
prosecution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
after
they've
acted?
you
--
i
had
understood
you
to
say
that
the
argument
troubled
the
situation
where
this
suit
was
merely
pending
before
the
agency.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i'm
--
i
wasn't
thinking
--
i
had
understood
you
to
go
on
the
basis
that
because
it
was
being
tried,
that
issue
was
being
tried
before
the
agency,
the
government
couldn't
file
a
suit
of
its
own
to
violate
the
antitrust
act.
now,
i
thought
we'd
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
gone
differently
with
reference
to
the
federal
trade
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
remedies
here
are
different,
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
would
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
just
be
a
partial
defense
wouldn't
it,
that
the
remedy
wouldn't
be
a
reason
for
dismissing
the
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it?
i
--
i've
missed
to
ask
you
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
here
that
this
can't
be
as
barred
because
the
remedy
is
the
same
but
there's
just
one
remedy,
there
could
be
other
remedies,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
prayer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
prayer
you're
talking
about,
effective
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
looking
at
the
prayer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
