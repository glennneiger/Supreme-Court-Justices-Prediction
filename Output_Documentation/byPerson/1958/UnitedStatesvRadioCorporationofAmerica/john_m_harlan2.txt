justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
government,
a
response
to
its
notification
by
the
commission
had
gone
and
said
this
is
--
this
is
--
this
is
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
antitrust
law.
we
want
to
put
--
put
in
some
evidence
as
to
my
case.
the
commissioner
said
we're
not
concerned,
we'll
--
we'll
--
we'll
take
it
all.
we're
really
--
we're
really
not
concerned
whether
this
have
been
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
here
if,
unless
we
find
that
the
thing
--
that
this
exchange
is
not
otherwise
in
the
public
interest,
and
that
we
find
it
is
why
the
antitrust
law
violation
is
something
that
we're
not
considering
but
with
that
--
we'll
do
that
--
that
would
have
been
a
good
sustainable
order
of
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
understand
your
point
of
view
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
that
phrase
in
there
whenever
in
any
suit,
action,
or
proceedings,
civil
or
criminal,
brought
under
the
provisions
that
(inaudible)
or
in
any
proceeding
brought
to
enforce
or
review
findings
of
the
--
an
order
to
the
federal
trade
commission,
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see,
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
if
the
government
had
wanted
to
embrace
this
great
opportunity
in
going
to
trail
in
an
antitrust
case
before
the
commission,
the
commission
would've
had
a
right
to
say
no
as
it
did
to
the
effect
as
i
understand
it,
this
should
bring
(inaudible)
that
not
--
we're
not
going
to
hold
any
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
government
couldn't
insist
without
a
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
citation,
solicitor
general
with
the
mackay
case
(inaudible),
if
we
don't
hold
it
up?
justice
john
m.
harlan
346.
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
language
was
in
(inaudible)
at
the
time
of
this
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
it
--
commission
obligated
to
give
the
attorney
general
notice,
the
united
states
notice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
did
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but,
in
contrast,
the
word
telephone
company
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
in
the
illustration
on
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
per
se
violation
where
the
government
that
is
so
minded
could
go
after,
prosecute,
get
a
conviction,
get
an
injunction,
and
where
the
same
transaction
came
up
before
the
fcc
they
could
say,
“well,
this
is
per
se
alright
but
it's
dimmed
an
excessive
amount
too
much
and
we
think
we're
overriding
public
interest,
it
means
that
we
should
throw
this
into
the
balance
but
ignore
it.”
that's
the
kind
of
a
situation
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
i
mean
throw
it
into
the
hopper
and
then
discard
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
last
point
in
judge
kirkpatrick's
opinion,
forget
all
about
what
we've
been
talking
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(inaudible)
which
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
discretionary
finding
of
fact
made
by
a
good
judge,
a
competent
man,
does
that
doctrine
apply
in
your
view
in
the
case
of
this
kind?
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
you're
going
to
come
to
that
phase
of
the
case.
i
don't
want
you
to
anticipate
it
but
it
struck
me
to
something
that
you
ought
to
argue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
suppose
you
wouldn't
concede
that
you
were
negligent
you
just
needed
a
good
judgment,
that's
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
segal,
what
--
when
was
this
antitrust
suit
started?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
happened
to
it
in
the
end
of
the
--
was
it
awaiting
the
decision
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
suspense.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
--
excuse
me,
sir.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
--
does
the
record
show
what
has
been
expanded
by
your
client?
justice
john
m.
harlan
other
than
the
$3
million
for
the
purchase?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
i
hate
to
take
your
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
notice
in
the
record
this
exchange
of
memorandum
between
two
of
the
commissioners,
they're
not
involved
which
seems
to
be
that
after
the
dissenting
commissioner
who
thought
there
should
be
a
hearing
and
have
hearsay
one
of
the
majority
came
forward
and
said
among
other
things
which
i
take
it's
the
fair
inference
you're
speaking
for
the
proclamation
for
all
majority
that
they
--
the
commission
did
not
consider
that
it
was
binding
the
government
in
any
way
with
respect
to
bringing
a
future
antitrust
suit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
question
that
prompts
me
to
ask
is
this.
that
in
this
field
of
law,
whatever
that
aspect
of
the
case
may
turn
out
to
be,
being
unnoticed
that
at
least
the
agency
didn't
consider
that
it
was
tying
the
hands
of
the
government.
did
you
people
take
any
steps
to
ascertain
from
the
antitrust
division
whether
or
not
they
intended
to
go
forward
or
whether
they
were
calling
acquits
or
whatnot?
justice
john
m.
harlan
into
this
or
any
other
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
government
did
file
its
complaint
the
day
after
the
fcc
issued
its
order,
what
will
be
your
position
in
that
sort
of
circumstances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i'll
make
it
even
more
than
that
from
my
point.
supposing
that
they
brought
suit
before
the
commission,
after
the
hearings
had
concluded
but
before
the
commission
had
issued
its
opinion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that
my
question
was
--
perhaps
i
misspoke
myself
was
what
the
chief
justice
has
now
amended
and
clarified,
i'm
talking
about
an
antitrust
action
brought
to
the
court
by
the
government.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
couldn't
--
they
couldn't
include
any
allegation
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you're
stating
as
broadly
enough
so
that
what
you're
saying
here
would
apply
to
any
administrative
commission
assuming
comparable
facts
where
an
antitrust
law
or
an
antitrust
consideration
with
the
fact
here
on
the
administrative
determination.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you'll
go
as
far
as
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
--
i
have
put
that
in
my
question
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
an
argument
that
might
be
made
a
little
later
on
if
you
have
the
antitrust
suit
that
the
pre-court
can
go
against
you.
this
is
just
a
case
of
a
little
over
enthusiastic
drawing
to
prepare
for
a
release.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
had
brought
a
complaint
that
it
simply
said
that
the
action
of
the
commission
in
authorizing
this
exchange
constituted
a
monopoly
in
violation
with
this
sherman
act,
period.
no
antecedent
conspiracy
whatnot.
could
you
maintain
that
action?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
--
you
really
rely
on
your
allegations
that
there
was
an
antecedent
conspiracy
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
read
--
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
to
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
will
read
the
--
these
two
questions.
if
you
will
read
ground
three
of
the
district
court's
holding
as
being
a
alternative
ground
independently
of
the
two
others,
that
is
what
we
call
laches
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
were
--
if
you
were
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
second,
my
--
my
second
branch
of
the
question
is,
i
don't
read
this
as
being
laches,
in
the
conventional
sense.
i
read
this
as
being
considerations
that
move
the
court
to
deny
equitable
relief,
if
you
read
that
line?
