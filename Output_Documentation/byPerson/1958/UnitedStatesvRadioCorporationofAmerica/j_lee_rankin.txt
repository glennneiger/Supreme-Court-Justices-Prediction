mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
involves
the
question
of
a
conspiracy
charged
by
the
government
involving
the
exchange
of
radio
and
television
stations
in
cleveland,
ohio
for
radio
and
television
stations
in
philadelphia,
pennsylvania.
the
questions
before
this
court
are
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
federal
communications
commission
in
allowing
the
exchange
precludes
the
government
from
bringing
an
antitrust
proceeding
because
of
the
conspiracy
between
nbc,
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
rca,
to
obtain
this
exchange.
and
against
the
contract
which
was
made
as
covering
the
exchange
as
a
part
of
the
conspiracy.
and
further,
whether
there
are
equitable
considerations
in
the
nature
of
collateral
estoppel
or
akin
to
res
judicata,
or
by
reason
of
the
--
the
delay
of
the
government
in
bringing
the
action
which
would
preclude
the
proceeding.
the
matter
came
before
the
district
court,
the
eastern
division.
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
and
there
the
government's
case
was
dismissed.
it
came
up
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
before
the
commission,
the
commission
allowed
the
exchange
and
there
was
a
stipulation
as
a
part
of
the
district
court
proceedings
between
the
government
and
the
parties
that
the
commission
had
the
duty
to
consider
and
did
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
antitrust
violations
in
passing
upon
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
allow
this
exchange
of
the
cleveland
station.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
did
not
but
it
was
given
notice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
commission
notified
it
that
there
were
possible
antitrust
considerations
involved,
and
the
department
of
justice
did
not
appear.
there
was
no
hearing.
there
was
no
adversary
proceeding.
there
was
no
opinion.
the
order
was
just
made
allowing
the
transfers
to
be
made
under
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
does
not
think
so.
the
government
believes
that
the
problem
with
the
commission
had
was
to
--
was
defined
by
the
statute,
which
was
to
determine
a
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
regarding
this
exchange.
now,
this
was
not
a
comparative
proceeding.
there
was
no
other
applicant
before
the
commission
for
this
--
these
particular
stations.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
--
we
believe
that
stipulation
involves
this.
that
the
commission
could
properly
have
considered
and
did
have
a
duty
to
consider,
whether
or
not
there
was
such
a
violation.
and
it
could
have
determined
within
the
stipulation
that
there
was
or
that
there
was
not
such
a
violation.
and
even
if
it
did,
the
consideration
that
it
was
determined
--
it
was
to
pass
on
was
not
whether
that
was
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
but
what
it
was
determining
was
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
under
the
statute.
now,
to
depart
a
moment
on
that,
if
you
recall
this
court
in
the
case
of
federal
communications
commission
against
rca
communications,
in
the
case
involving
whether
or
not
the
mackay
telegraph
company
would
be
allowed
to
extend
its
lines,
the
radio
communication
in
foreign
areas
to
the
netherlands
and
to
portugal.
the
federal
communications
commission
determined
that
that
application
should
be
allowed
to
those
two
points
on
the
basis
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
provide
more
competition,
and
it
made
the
decision
only
on
that
ground.
and
the
court
reversed
because
it
held
that
competition
was
not
enough.
but
the
commission
was
considering
the
element
of
statute
313
regarding
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
thought
that
competition
itself
was
the
element
that
was
enough
to
be
controlling.
and
this
court
reversed
that
decision
and
sent
the
case
back
to
the
commission
to
determine
according
to
the
proper
standard
not
merely
whether
or
not
if
the
competition
was
involved
or
whether
competition
would
be
benefited
under
section
313.
but
whether
or
not
under
its
basic
statutory
duty,
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
would
determine
that
these
extensions
should
be
made
so
that
taking
into
account
that
case,
and
the
duty
of
the
commission
by
the
statute
the
commission
could
have
found
either
that
there
was
a
violation
or
there
was
not,
but
that
was
not
enough.
it
had
to
move
on
from
that
point
and
determine
what
effect
that
violation
would
have
upon
this
applicant's
right
to
have
his
application
--
his
application
granted
to
have
these
particular
stations
exchanged.
and
in
that
determination
there
could
be
many
factors
that
--
it
must
necessarily
considered
including
the
question
of
--
of
its
programming
ability,
its
financial
ability
and
all
the
other
elements
that
go
into
the
consideration
of
the
commission.
now,
the
fact
is
that
the
commission
says
that
it
did
not
consider
that
if
--
it
had
the
responsibility
for
determining.
and
it
has
a
memorandum
here
before
the
court
and
what
it
says,
that
it
didn't
have
the
responsibility
of
determining
the
antitrust
features
of
this
manner
as
such,
but
it
doesn't
withdraw
at
all
from
the
proposition
that
it
has
a
duty
to
consider
them
as
they
bear
upon
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
so
keeping
that
in
mind,
the
difference
between
the
standard
that
they
must
apply
and
the
elements
that
are
involved
in
antitrust
enforcement,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
becomes
clearer
as
to
the
proper
disposition.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
think
it
would,
mr.
justice,
providing
they
first
reach
the
point
of
whether
or
not
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
was
served
if
they
concluded
it
would
not
be.
i
don't
think
they
had
to
reach
the
antitrust
issue
at
all.
but
if
they
would
consider
that
otherwise
all
the
other
elements
would
justify
and
they
would
entirely
disregard
the
antitrust
feature.
i
think
the
nbc
case
by
this
court
in
regard
to
the
network
regulations
requires
them
to
consider
the
antitrust
feature
as
a
part
of
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
measure.
so,
to
answer
your
question
if
it's
not
--
if
i
haven't
made
it
clear,
if
they
don't
reach
the
question
because
they
already
find
that
the
application
cannot
be
approved
because
it
is
not
in
the
public
interest,
for
reasons
involved
in
that,
other
than
the
antitrust.
it
seems
to
me
they
don't
have
to
go
as
far
as
to
consider
the
antitrust
issues
at
all.
but
if
they
find
everything
else
and
they
completely
disregard
antitrust
issues,
then
i
think
its
error
under
the
nbc
case.
does
that
answer
the
question?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
statute
provides
to
the
regard
to
a
particular
federal
statute
and
it's
the
determination
by
a
court
that
they
can
rely
upon
as
a
prima
facie
evidence.
now
this
--
this
system
of
regulatory
statute
for
the
federal
communication
commission
does
have
provision
for
exemption
with
regard
to
telegraph
and
telephone
companies.
but
it's
very
careful
in
those
sections
to
provide
for
the
notice
to
different
institute
parties,
commissions,
attorney
general,
and
other
people
in
the
states,
and
for
hearing
the
proceedings,
so
as
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
consolidation
or
the
other
elements
are
proper
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
contends
that
it
cannot.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
issue
before
the
commission
is
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity,
and
that
the
antitrust
feature
is
a
consideration
to
be
taken
into
account
but
is
not
a
determination
of
that
issue
for
the
purposes
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
they
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
think
that
their
position
would
be,
from
their
briefs,
that
at
least
if
they
got
a
favorable
decision
that
they
could
have
the
benefit.
now,
if
it
was
adverse
to
them
before
the
commission
whether
they'd
be
bound
by
it
is
something
i
don't
gain
from
their
briefs.
i
think
you
can
learn
from
counsel
more
accurately
than
i
can
describe
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
should
be
binding
both
ways.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
would
still
contend
that
that
was
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
it
should
determine
the
antitrust
aspects
insofar
as
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
section
1.
but
its
duty
was
merely
to
determine
the
effect
of
that
question
as
it
related
to
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
now,
i
think
that
is
borne
out
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
which
is
very
clear
in
313
on
page
5
of
the
government's
brief,
where
it's
made
very
plain
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
to
apply
in
great
detail
to
this
entire
area
of
radio
broadcasting.
and
then
it
goes
on,
not
to
saying,
how
the
commission
shall
handle
to
the
matter?
but
the
proceedings
before
a
court,
and
how
the
court,
if
it
imposes
certain
requirements
in
regard
to
licenses
and
so
forth,
those
shall
be
carried
out
by
the
commission
so
it
recognizes
in
the
pattern
here.
and
when
the
--
in
the
legislative
history
when
it
came
up,
senator
dill
was
very
clear
that
the
court
should
continue
to
carry
out
and
apply
the
antitrust
laws.
and
the
only
purpose
of
the
commission
consideration
was
to
make
certain
that
that
would
be
an
element,
the
competitive
factor,
in
the
determination
of
what
was
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
that's
one
of
complaints
that
the
commission
makes
in
its
showing
we
have
before
the
court.
it
says
it
would
be
an
impossible
burden
that
it
isn't
equipped
to
have
such
proceedings
under
its
set
up.
it
doesn't
have
the
money,
but
beyond
that
if
it
had
to
do
it
in
all
the
cases
where
they
were
charges
of
antitrust
violations
that
it
would
never
get
its
work
done,
which
it
conceives
to
be
the
principal
job
of
determining
what
is
in
the
public
interest
regarding
whether
a
license
should
be
granted
or
denied.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
impossible
for
it
to
carry
out
this
primary
duty
that
the
congress
has
imposed
on
it
if
it
had
to
file
all
these
issues
like
a
court,
and
even
then
it
says
it
doesn't
equipped
to
do
so.
now
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
often
obtain
it
by
asking,
maybe
waive
it
by
not
asking,
and
they
certainly
would
--
i
would
think
would
raise
it.
and
here
they
had
no
--
no
proceeding
of
any
kind,
there
was
an
investigation
by
the
commission.
but
there
was
no
adversary
proceeding
of
any
kind.
so
that
certainly
if
the
issue
was
found
against
them,
they
would
say
they
had
no
trial
whatsoever
and
that
would
be
true.
it
would
be
merely,
the
agency
itself
going
out
investigating
and
deciding
they
were
guilty
or
innocent.
now,
that
would
be
something
that
the
commission
it
seems
to
the
government
would
have
the
power
to
do,
insofar
was
it
--
it
would
bear
not
preclude
them
on
the
public
interest
and
convenience,
and
necessity,
but
they
have
a
bearing
on
it,
in
one
of
the
factors.
but
to
decide
the
issue
of
whether
they're
guilty
of
a
violation
or
a
conspiracy
without
a
trial
of
any
kind.
it
seems
to
me
they
would
be
the
first
ones
to
say
if
that
happened
to
them
and
that
adverse
--
holding
was
adverse
that
it
couldn't
be
done
under
the
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
couldn't
have
insist
that
on
a
trial
but
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
we
didn't
ask
for
it.
i
want
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
took
the
position
that
it
should
not
be
precluded
and
that
this
--
it
had
a
right
to
proceed
under
the
sherman
act
regardless
of
what
the
commission
did
because
the
commission
was
not
trying
to
decide
this
very
issue.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
that's
our
contention.
we
say
that
the
whole
theory
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
could.
now,
this
--
because
of
this,
this
was
not
a
comparative
hearing
where
you
had
other
applicants
for
the
same
facility.
you
have
this
one
exchange
between
these
two
parties.
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
was
--
is
just
one
factor
in
regard
to
the
public
interest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
the
government
that
they
could
in
this
regard
in
the
nbc
case
about
regulations
where
the
competitive
factor
it
seem
to
be
over
winning
to
the
commission
and
decisive.
they
decided
the
case
just
on
that
basis
in
allowing
these
extensions
that
i
just
described
in
regard
to
the
netherlands
and
portugal.
and
this
court
said
you
can't
do
that.
you
must
go
back
and
decide
all
these
various
elements
if
they
fit
into
the
pattern
of
the
public
interest.
no
one
of
them
controlling,
so
that
the
competitive
factor,
it
seems
to
the
government
can't
be
the
one
that
can
say
this
cannot
be
granted
at
all.
now,
take
into
consider
this
--
consideration
in
this
very
case,
here
is
nbc,
one
of
the
alleged
conspirators,
that
involves
a
great
network
in
this
country.
it
has
five
owned
and
operated
stations
which
is
all
that
is
permitted
to
have
under
the
fcc
regulations.
now,
they
are
operating
those
over
the
country
and
it's
recognized
that
they
are
performing
a
public
service.
they
certainly
have
programming
ability.
they
have
the
financial
capacity.
they
have
demonstrated
their
ability
to
operate
stations
in
the
public
interest
in
other
places.
now,
if
you
find
the
conspiracy
here
without
a
trial
or
anything
else
but
there
is
enough
to
convince
the
commission
that
there
is
a
violation
of
section
1.
should
that
in
itself
be
conclusive,
that's
the
--
that's
the
issue.
and
the
government
says
it
should
not.
it's
one
of
the
factors
that
has
to
be
considered.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
if
it
found
that
that
was
an
element
that
in
itself.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
mackay
case
makes
it
clear
that
competition
alone
can't
decide
that
you
have
to
take
in
to
consideration
these
other
factors
because
otherwise
the
court
wouldn't
have
reversed
the
case
and
sent
it
back
and
said
it
was
error
to
consider
merely
competition
and
think
the
competition
alone
was
sufficient
for
the
commission
to
act
on.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
their
principal
reliance
at
this
time
is
upon
primary
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
that
the
court
treated
it
also
as
akin
to
res
judicata
and
i
think
estoppel
in
pais
would
be
a
description
of
it.
but
then
you
have
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
trial,
an
adversary
proceeding,
in
which
people
can
be
bound
and
there
is
none
of
that
element
here.
there
was
no
finding
as
such.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
was
the
position
of
the
lower
court.
and
we
think
it
would
because
the
federal
communications
commission
does
not
have
the
responsibility
of
deciding
the
same
issue
that
the
court
did.
and
it
was
conceived
by
congress
and
intended
that
this
issue
of
the
violation
antitrust
laws
should
be
decided
by
the
courts
and
not
by
the
commission
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
it's
very
clear
in
section
311
they
direct
that
if
the
courts
decide
that
a
station
license
shall
be
revoked,
the
commission
is
required
to
follow
that
out.
and,
they
are
also
required
not
to
issue
a
license
where
the
courts
have
directed
the
revocation.
they're
not
subsequently
to
issue
a
license
where
such
a
revocation
has
been
directed.
now,
it's
very
clear
in
1952,
the
congress
amended
the
act,
and
we
deal
with
that
on
the
bottom
of
page
29
and
at
the
top
of
page
30
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
effect
i
think
that's
what
they
did
in
the
district
court.
they
said
that
by
reason
of
this
proceeding
before
the
federal
communications
commission.
you
--
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
that
is
the
lower
court,
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
violated
the
section
1
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
sherman
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
both
of
them.
now,
it
doesn't
have
any
of
the
elements
of
the
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata
where
you
have
to
have
an
adversary
proceeding
in
a
trial
between
the
same
parties.
and
even
if
you
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
federal
communications
commission
is
the
same
as
the
united
states
because
it's
a
governmental
agency,
you
still
don't
have
rca,
the
other
conspirator,
a
party
here,
and
they
had
no
hearing
of
any
kind.
and
they
certainly
would
never
come
into
this
court
and
say
that
they
were
bound
by
an
adverse
decision
of
that
kind
where
it
was
made
merely
by
investigation,
no
hearing
and
no
opinion
either.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
have
joint
conspirators,
if
you
have
the
conspirators
and
one
of
them
was
found
not
guilty
that
the
conspiracy
would
fall,
that's
correct.
but
certainly
neither
conspirator
here
would
say
to
this
court
that
if
it
was
bound
by
a
decision
by
the
federal
communications
commission
as
to
violation
of
section
1,
if
it
didn't
even
have
a
hearing
on
it,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
there
was
no
adversary
proceeding
of
any
kind.
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
try
out,
cross-examine
witnesses,
the
adverse
witnesses
or
anything,
and
they
certainly
would
not
agree
that
they
were
bound
--
to
be
bound
by
any
such
proceeding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
346.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
346
u.s.
86,
it's
cited
in
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
in
1952,
when
the
congress
did
examine
this
question.
the
court
--
the
complaint
was
made
that
the
commission
had
the
power
and
apparently
was
exercising
it
to
re-examine
the
question
after
a
person
was
tried
in
a
court
for
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
--
the
application
here
doesn't
show
any
violation
of
any
--
the
--
the
violation
is
in
connection
with
the
exchange
but
the
conspiracy
was
much
broader
than
the
exchange.
the
conspiracy
was
to
try
to
get
two
owned
and
operated
stations
for
nbc
in
one
or
two
of
the
eight
principal
markets
of
the
united
states
instead
of
in
--
the
tenth,
which
was
cleveland,
and
the
eleventh,
which
was
washington,
that
they
then
had,
so
the
conspiracy
extended
beyond
this
particular
transaction
to
extending
--
exchanging
the
stations
in
cleveland
and
philadelphia.
it
was
to
also
get
them
one
station
in
one
of
the
eight
--
eight
principal
markets
for
the
station
they
owned
in
washington.
that's
the
conspiracy
charged.
now,
there
is
no
question
about
an
allegation
of
very
predatory
action
here.
they
started
out
with
the
idea
of
using
the
affiliation
that
nbc
could
make
available
and
did
have
with
westinghouse
in
philadelphia
and
denying
that
affiliation
in
philadelphia,
and
also
threatening
it
to
deny
it
in
boston
where
westinghouse
hadn't.
and
not
give
it
to
--
in
pittsburgh
where
it
was
requiring
a
new
station
unless
it
gave
in
to
this
exchange.
and
the
exchange
was
a
very
valuable
and
attractive
proposition
for
nbc
and
rca
and
that
the
property
they
paid
$3
million
additional
for
the
exchange
over
the
--
exchange
in
the
cleveland
station
but
the
property
was
worth
over
$1
million
a
year
according
to
the
claims
of
the
government.
and
we
--
and
that's
the
allegations
of
the
government
in
that
regard.
so
this
is
an
act
where
powerful
financial
groups,
nbc
and
rca,
decided
that
they
wanted
some
property
that
belonged
to
somebody
else,
and
that
was
westinghouse,
which
is
a
pretty
powerful
group
in
itself.
and
by
saying
we
won't
allow
you
affiliation
with
our
network
any
longer.
they
were
able
to
force
this
transaction
across,
and
that's
our
allegation
and
we
expect
to
prove
them.
it's
about
as
predatory
as
anything
that
you
could
experience
in
this
field.
and
the
fact
that
they
were
able
to
accomplish
with
this
large
and
aggregation
of
capital,
as
westinghouse
demonstrates,
what
the
effect
would
be
on
the
lesser
financial
groups
and
lesser
business
enterprises
engaged
in
this
industry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
investigated.
and
it
went
into
it
by
making
various
inquiries
of
the
parties
in
the
westinghouse
and
so
forth.
and
when
this
matter
came
up
in
regard
to
the
amendment
of
this
section,
certain
language
was
deleted
and
that
is
set
forth
on
page
30.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
of
the
government's
brief,
in
italics.
to
meet
the
complaint
that
the
commission,
after
a
court
had
decided
not
to
revoke
a
license
of
a
radio
station.
the
commission
could
go
in
and
decide
to
revoke
the
license
or
not
grant
it.
and
the
congress
in
its
report
said
that
this
was
an
unusual
situation
where
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
review
the
court
after
it
has
decided
in
favor
of
the
appellant.
and
it
was
congressional
action
was
to
remove
that
particular
power
from
the
commission
but
not
to
take
away
in
any
respect
the
power
of
the
court
to
act
in
regard
to
revoking
and
acting
upon
licenses.
now,
the
last
sentence
deals
with
the
stopping
of
the
united
states
and
the
congress
acted
on
that
in
the
legislative
history,
the
conference
report
we
set
out
at
length
on
page
31.
but
it
made
the
explicit
that
it
consider
that
language
mere
surplusage,
the
last
sentence.
and
that
it
was
not
taken
any
powers
away
from
the
government
at
all
but
it
was
merely
taking
that
language
out
because
it's
considered
as
surplusage.
and
it's
so
set
out
in
detail
in
the
conference
report.
the
conference
report
is
set
out
on
page
33.
the
main
report
of
the
committee
is
set
out
on
pages
30
and
31
in
the
footnote
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
conference
report
said
the
deletion
was
not
of
any
legal
significance.
it
is
the
view
of
the
members
of
the
conference
committee
that
the
last
sentence
in
the
present
section
311
is
surplusage.
and
that
by
omitting
it
from
the
present
law,
the
power
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
private
person
to
proceed
under
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
be
curtailed
or
affected
in
any
way
so
that
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
on
the
intent
of
the
congress.
now,
the
principal
position
of
the
appellees,
it
seemed
to
us
at
first
that
the
--
the
responsibility
of
the
commission
was
to
determine
this
very
question
or
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
such.
the
government's
position
was
that
is
not
the
function
of
the
commission,
that
it
only
determines
it
as
it
relates
to
the
public
interest,
to
the
convenience,
and
necessity.
and
that
it
is
akin
to
the
georgia
case
in
regard
to
the
question
of
rates
where
the
court
allowed
the
action
brought
by
the
state
of
georgia
even
though
the
icc
had
approved
the
rates.
but
it
said,
the
court
said,
the
approval
did
not
go
to
the
conspiracy
under
which
the
rates
remained.
and
that
is
the
position
of
the
government
here.
the
conspiracy
for
this
exchange
was
not
approved
in
any
way
by
the
commission
and
it
was
not
its
function.
it
merely
approved
the
simple
application
for
the
exchange
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
and
it
is
the
government's
position
that
it
could
have
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
that
as
between
these
two
parties,
it
was
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
to
allow
this
exchange
of
these
and
allow
this
license
and
leave
the
question
of
the
resolution
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
antitrust
violation
that
they
would
be
liable
for
under
this
conspiracy
that
was
broader
than
the
exchange
to
the
court
to
determine.
and
if
the
courts
determined
it,
adversely,
their
license
could
always
be
determined
--
terminated
and
revoked
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
is
not.
it
was
--
that
was
merely
a
matter
of
courtesy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
didn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can't
say
whether
they
do
it
always
or
not.
they
do
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
as
to
the
telephone
and
telegraph
company
though
they
are
--
the
commission
has
given
the
power
to
exempt
them
from
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
here
they
can't.
and
so
it's
--
as
we
regard
it
in
the
government
is
merely
a
matter
of
grace
as
to
whether
they
give
notice
or
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
government
believes
that
it
could
because
that
is
only
one
factor
regarding
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
might,
depending
upon
the
situation,
and
in
this
particular
situation
you'd
have
the
way
against
it.
the
fact
that
nbc
is
engaged
in
all
of
this
large
operation
that
it
has
other
stations
that
have
been
found
to
be
operating
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
and
is
in
fact
involving
a
great
network
or
operating
in
a
great
network.
all
of
those
things
would
have
to
be
weighed.
and
if
we
would
have
appealed
as
we
recognize
the
only
way
the
question
of
whether
that
he
--
there
is
error
in
the
granting
of
the
--
approving
the
grant
of
the
license
is
concerned
would
be
an
appeal
under
402.
if
we
would
have
appealed,
the
government
would
have
a
test
of
whether
it
was
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
and
the
--
the
competitive
factor
would
be
only
one
of
the
considerations
and
we
would
be
up
against
the
proposition
that
in
that
kind
of
a
hearing
there
would
only
be
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
exchange
from
westinghouse,
who
was
asking
for
it
too
at
that
time.
and
nbc
should
be
granted.
there
would
not
be
a
question
of
someone
else
making
the
application
which
would
be
present
in
a
comparative
hearing.
and
we
couldn't
establish,
or
we
didn't
believe
we
could
establish,
that
the
competitive
factor
in
the
light
of
the
mackay
case
could
control
every
other
consideration
in
this
kind
of
an
exchange
proceeding
because
the
test
would
be
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
now,
that
isn't
the
test
under
the
sherman
act.
the
sherman
act,
the
question
is
solely,
did
they
conspire
and
did
they
act
in
accordance
with
the
conspiracy
to
try
to
carry
it
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i'm
arguing
that
under
the
sherman
act
there
is
a
trial
of
the
very
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
filed
under
the
communications
act.
there
is
that
element
to
consider
whether
or
not
there
is
a
violation,
but
it
also
has
to
be
considered
with
all
the
other
elements
of
public
interest
to
determine
how
they
all
fit
together
and
whether
or
not
in
light
of
the
whole
package
is
still
is
in
the
public
interest
to
grant
this
particular
application.
now,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
assuming
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
here.
i
think
that
they
could
still
be
satisfied
that
the
--
with
that
the
government
could
prove
the
complaint
as
charged
and
weigh
that
against
this
particular
application
for
the
exchange
and
find
that
all
of
the
other
elements
were
in
favor
sufficiently
so
that
the
competitive
factors
could
not
be
the
controlling
factor
and
therefore
they
had
to
grant
the
license.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
recognize
there
is
a
difference
between
a
proven
violation
of
the
law
and
the
competitive
factor.
but
i
do
think
the
competitive
factor
is
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
reach
in
the
sherman
act
to
preserve
free
enterprise
in
competition.
and
so
it's
--
it
may
be
weighted
more
of
course,
it
is
weighted
more
where
there's
the
conviction
because
they
have
actually
interfered
with
that
competitive
enterprise.
but
you
still
have
the
question
of
competition
involved
in
whether
or
not
there
is
an
antitrust
violation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
all
except
the,
"ignore
it."
i
think
they
have
to
put
it
on
the
scales
for
something.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
they
could
say
now
that
isn't
enough.
we
put
it
down
the
scales.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
we
won't
--
it
doesn't
weigh
enough
so
that
we
can
deny
this
license.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
who's
going
to
go
up
on
this
proceeding?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
had
a
comparative
hearing
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
then
you'd
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
it's
stipulated
that
we
could
have
appealed
and
we
could
have
asked
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
for
reconsideration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
it
could
be
the
only
on
the
question
of
this
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
because
i
think
that
has
to
be
weighed
along
with
all
the
others,
now,
in
determining
the
public
interest.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
lower
--
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
finally
would
say
lay
down
a
rule
and
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
per
se
precludes
anybody
from
ever
having
a
license.
but
i
don't
think
that
you
could
say
that
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
what
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
means
in
this
law.
that
carries
in
--
in
its
connotation
to
many
other
elements
that
have
to
be
waived,
and
that's
the
problem
that
the
government
was
up
against.
if
we
should
ask
--
come
in
to
that
proceeding,
and
ask
for
an
appeal
because
we
were
dealing
with
a
different
measure
then
we
would
have
in
the
trial
of
the
antitrust
law.
we
wanted
a
trial
of
the
question
of
whether
they
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
and
overt
acts
pursuant
to
it.
and
now,
there's
also
this
element
that
the
--
i
think
the
commission
could
properly
take
into
consideration
in
regard
to
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
and
that
is
this
very
statute
provides
that
if
the
court
should
determine
that
there
was
such
a
violation,
the
courts
could
direct
that
the
license
be
revoked,
and
that
would
take
care
of
the
whole
question,
so
that
is
something.
it
seems
to
me
the
commission
could
properly
take
into
account
in
weighing
this
whole
problem
of
all
the
different
elements
that
are
involved
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
so
that
i
don't
--
that
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
if
they'd
found
that
there
was
a
violation
they
could
take
that
alone
and
say,
“that
is
controlled.”
they
have
to
weigh
it
against
these
other
factors
to
determine
the
public
interest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
--
i
don't
base
it
upon
the
question
of
proof.
the
government
satisfied
that
it
can
prove
what
it
alleges
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
they
could.
i
think
they
could
waive
that
along
with
the
other
factors
in
the
public
interest
and
the
--
and
deny
the
license.
i
think
they
could
also
weigh
it
in
accordance
with
their
function
and
determine
the
public
interest,
and
feel
that
it
balancing
out
it
was
not
enough
to
deny
the
license
in
this
type
of
a
proceeding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
delay?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
it
should
at
all
to
the
government
in
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
that's
within
the
statutory
period
of
the
actions
brought,
it
was
brought
within
11
months
of
the
time
of
the
decision.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
bowles
case
that
cited
by
judge
kirkpatrick,
we
think
it's
not
applicable
at
all
because
in
the
bowles
case,
which
was
an
opa
case,
the
various
acts
that
were
involved
were
not
predatory.
they
were
not
deliberate
and
planned
like
this.
they
were
negligent
acts
and
they
had
already
proceeded
to
rectify
them
and
correct
them
so
there
were
all
the
elements
to
appeal
to
the
equity
as
distinguished
from
this
kind
of
a
situation
which
is
what
the
congress
conceived
that
the
government
would
try
to
protect
against.
if
there's
anything
to
be
protected
against
in
the
sherman
act,
basically,
certainly
you
would
start
with
the
predatory
action
where
there
is
a
deliberate
determination
to
take
somebody
else's
of
business
away
from
by
force
of
the
position
of
the
party.
so
the
government,
it's
not
in
the
record
but
the
government
had
to
take
some
time
to
analyze
the
action,
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
whether
the
validity
of
it.
and
then
there
was
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
proceed
criminally
or
civilly.
and
those
things
just
did
take
time
and
was
impossible
to
act
in
any
shorter
time
than
--
than
it
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
if
that
was
the
case
that
it
would
be
entirely
a
different
case.
i
think
that
they
did
make
an
exchange
of
facilities
and
personnel
and
so
forth
that
was
involved
large
properties
and
important
action.
but
they
had
noticed
before
they
did
that
that
the
commissioners,
doerfer
and
bartley,
they
did
not
consider
that
the
commission,
to
a
federal
communications
commission
decided
this
particular
question
or
that
it
was
their
function.
they
can
see
it
could
be
their
function
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
license
transfer
should
be
approved,
and
if
there
could
still
be
--
one
that
bartley
said
that
it
might
preclude
action
by
the
government
and
two,
the
commissioner
doerfer
made
a
public
statement
that
it
would
not
preclude.
so
they
had
notice
of
that
before
they
ever
made
defenses.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
misleading
of
anybody
that
the
government
wasn't
busily
working
on
this
case
and
planning
to
bring
some
action.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'd
say
to
the
latter
first
that
is
there
is
no
justification
for
the
holding
by
the
record
here.
but
secondly,
i'd
say
that
when
that
question
of
whether
you're
going
to
stop
the
united
states
when
bringing
in
an
action
of
this
type
that's
so
fundamental
to
a
--
the
preservation
of
free
enterprise
as
competition,
and
you
have
predatory
action
involved,
then
i'd
say
that
you
should
never
apply
estoppel
unless
it's
so
clear
that
the
public
interest
should
suffer
because
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
a
case,
arizona
against
california
in
which
that
question
was
examined
by
the
court
and
the
court
commented
about
it.
it
said
that
the
public
interest
was
too
important
for
the
negligence
of
its
servants
and
employees
to
preclude
the
public
from
having
its
interest
protected.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
takes
sometime
to
try
to
do
these
things
right
and
it
took
us
some
time
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
we
didn't.
we
took
the
position,
very
frankly,
all
the
way
through
that
the
commission's
action
did
not
affect
the
government's
rights.
so
we're
involved
in
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
petitioner
made
it
known
or
not.
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
about
six
months,
between
five
and
six
months
after
the
decision
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
and
the
way
those
things
go
--
excuse
me
--
they
--
there
--
i
assume
there
must
be
--
have
been
exchanged,
the
counsel
for
the
appellees
might
be
able
to
bring
light
in
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
gather
from
the
record
that's
all
i
can
give
you.
that
it
was
made
plain
because
the
--
it
was
stipulated
between
the
parties
that
the
department
was
notified
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
did
nothing
and
the
investigation
went
on.
they
stipulated
that
they
could
have
asked
for
reconsideration
or
appeal
in
all
of
these
things
so
that
all
this
time
the
action
was
going
on
and
the
other
agency
--
the
agency
was
working
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
not
to
have
known
it
was
not
a
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
call
attention
first
to
the
remarks
of
senator
dill
on
page
29
of
the
government's
brief.
senator
dill
had
charged
of
this
federal
communications
act
when
it
was
passed
and
he
was
asked
because
of
the
great
interest
of
the
congress
in
what
effect
this
might
have
on
the
antitrust
laws,
what
kind
of
a
function
the
federal
communications
commission
would
have
in
regard
to
it.
he
was
in
charge
of
the
bill
which
is
the
best
kind
of
legislative
history
and
this
is
what
he
said,
"there
is
anything
in
the
bill
providing
in
the
case
the
applicant
for
a
permit
is
found
to
be
acting
in
violation
of
the
sherman
antitrust
law
or
controls
a
monopoly
that
the
commission
may
pass
upon
the
question.”
senator
dill
replied.
that
although
the
bill
provided
for
denial
of
a
license
to
anybody
proved,
“has
been
convicted
under
the
sherman
antitrust
law
or
any
other
law
relating
to
monopoly."
and
that
relates
to
conviction.
it
“does
not
attempt
to
make
the
commission
the
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
certain
conditions
constitute
a
monopoly.
it
rather
leaves
that
to
the
court.”
now,
this
is
a
blow
to
the
whole
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
this
country
if
this
proceeding
is
upheld.
and
it's
found
that
the
district
court
was
right
because
the
whole
concept
of
congress
here
is
that
the
courts
should
enforce
this
laws
and
senator
dill
told
the
congress
when
he
was
asked
that
very
question
about
this
bill
that
it
wasn't
for
them
to
decide
this
very
question
that
they're
trying
to
tell
you
was
decided
in
this
case
against
the
government.
now,
let
us
turn
again
in
52
to
see
what
the
legislative
history
was
on
page
31
in
the
footnote.
and
it's
a
rather
long
footnote
and
i
commend
it
all
to
you,
but
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
portion
beginning
more
over
about
the
second
full
--
the
second
sentence
of
the
third
sentence
or
the
second
full
--
the
first
full
paragraph.
“moreover,
such
an
argument
is
particularly
pertinent
in
connection
with
alleged
violation
to
the
antitrust
statutes
which
are
the
particular
problems
of
the
department
of
justice
and
do
not,
by
any
other
law,
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
independent
quasi-judicial
agency
of
government.
so
that
the
emphasis
throughout
is
placed
upon
the
fact
that
313
preserves
the
antitrust
enforcement
through
the
courts.
now,
this
conspiracy,
we
don't
say
the
conspiracy
occurred
when
the
commission
ruled
on
this
license
or
this
application
for
transfer.
the
conspiracy
occurred
when
they
made
their
agreement
to
use
the
power
of
their
network
to
try
to
make
westinghouse
give
the
station
up,
that's
when
it
occurred.
and
we
say
that
it
was
broader
than
this
one
transaction,
they
decided
to
get
two
stations
away
from
somebody
else
and
they
certainly
have
the
right
to
use
their
network
affiliation
to
contract
with
the
station,
we
don't
question
that.
but
they
had
no
right
to
abuse
it
and
use
it
to
force
somebody
else
to
give
up
the
station
that
they
have
by
reason
of
the
power.
and
when
they
could
take
and
threaten
westinghouse
with
laws
of
not
only
philadelphia,
but
boston
and
--
and
not
getting
one
at
pittsburgh.
you
can
see
what
it
would
mean
to
any
little
operator
that
only
had
one
station
and
his
very
economic
existence
will
depend
upon.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
wouldn't
claim
that
we
could.
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
action
of
the
commission
is
a
action
under
the
statute
which
is
based
upon
the
public
interest
and
the
statutory
concept.
and
if
there
was
any
action
where
there
was
a
conspiracy
or
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade
that
would
be
the
basis
and
not
the
licensing.
and
i
--
i
take
the
position
that
the
government
had
the
right,
properly
to
ask
for
divestiture
here
and
also
ask
a
court
to
restrain
these
people
from
carrying
out
the
rest
of
their
conspiracy,
not
that
they
couldn't
go
and
get
a
license.
if
the
court
said
under
antitrust
principles,
that
they
could
go
ahead,
but
the
conspiracy
was
not
being
continued
and
that
this
was
part
of
the
fruits
of
it.
but
certainly,
in
all
the
antitrust
cases
in
this
country,
the
court
would
have
the
right
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
--
these
offenders
were
entitled
to
get
the
fruits
of
this
unlawful
act
and
could
say
after
this,
just
like
in
the
paramount
case,
you
come
into
this
court
and
show
us
that
you're
not
trying
to
use
the
power
of
your
network
to
get
this
next
station
that
you
acquired.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
we
want.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
certainly
do.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
we
say
it's
continuing
and
was
continuing
all
the
time
and
is
today.
that
was
the
whole
philosophy
that
they
were
going
to
acquire
not
only
one,
but
two
and
they
were
going
to
use
the
power
of
their
network
to
do
it.
that's
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
it
plain
here,
that
what
they're
seeking
is
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
there's
no
place
in
this
country
that
anything
so
important,
to
the
free
enterprise
of
this
country
and
competition
should
ever
be
lost
except
by
the
act
of
congress
when
they
should
declare
that
whether
or
not
there
should
be
immunity
and
congress
has
them.
in
the
maritime
case,
this
court
has
given
great
thought
and
consideration
to
it
and
there,
there's
an
expressed
provision
that
if
the
act
isn't
unlawful
as
judge
branson
said,
the
maritime
commission
can
give
that
immunity
but
they
can't
go
out
and
give
it
if
the
congress
didn't
say
so.
and
the
congress
didn't
say
so
in
this
case.
and
the
same
is
true
in
the
icc
cases
where
the
consolidation,
the
mclean
case.
it
specifically
provided
and
that's
why
the
government
came
into
those
cases
that
justice
stewart
was
asking
about.
the
maritime
cases
and
the
icc
case
about
consolidation,
the
government
came
in
because
they
lose
their
right
for
the
people
if
they
don't
win
and
protect.
but
in
this
situation,
we
don't
believe
they
lose
those
rights
because
the
congress
has
said,
“these
rights
with
the
public
interest
must
be
protected
in
the
courts
of
this
country.”
and
we
have
the
right
to
continue
to
try
to
protect
it.
and
there
is
nothing
to
this
primary
jurisdiction
principle
in
this
area
because
always
the
primary
jurisdiction
concept
deals
with
the
thought
that
the
body,
the
administrative
body
has
peculiar
expertise.
and
if
you
look
back
at
the
icc
cases,
in
the
abilene
case,
you
will
recall
that
the
reason
for
that
was
the
uniformity
that
had
to
be
in
the
rates
and
if
that
uniformity
was
taken
away
by
letting
independent
suits,
it
would
destroy
the
whole
system.
and
the
same
thing
is
examined
in
great
deal
by
this
court
in
the
maritime
cases,
in
the
far
east,
in
branson
and
in
cunard
in
which
the
--
this
court
went
in
to
the
fact
that
the
whole
concept
was
a
limitation
upon
competition
that
congress
had
provided
for.
but
here,
they're
trying
to
impose
and
get
an
immunity
that
congress
expressly
provided
against
time
after
time
in
this
legislative
history
and
it's
the
destruction
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
protection,
one
of
the
finest
and
the
most
imperative
things
to
preserve
in
free
enterprise
in
this
country.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
examined
this
question
in
mansfield
--
mansfield
case.
and
they
found
that
where
there
were
antitrust
considerations
and
they
found
the
antitrust
considerations
were
enough
to
borrow
the
license.
that
there
was
not
--
that
the
commissions'
function
was
not
to
decide
the
antitrust
matter
as
a
matter
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
they
said
so
in
so
many
words,
because
its
function
was
to
decide
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
and
the
antitrust
feature
was
for
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
you
heard
of
it
as
been
on
dependent
ground.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
seems
to
strike
him
that
there
was
--
even
if
he
had
jurisdiction
as
i
recall
the
name,
that
he
could
--
he
would
--
it's
not
that
relief
because
of
the
equitable
consideration
of
laches.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
of
the
decision
of
the
federal
communications
commission?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
conspiracy?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
yes,
i
think
that
--
assume
that
they
never
asked
for
a
license
at
any
time.
the
conspiratorial
act
was
when
they
made
the
agreement
and
when
they
entered
into
the
contract.
we
allege
both
of
them
as
violations
of
the
act
and
those
were
actionable
by
independent
persons,
private
persons
that
deal
with
the
government.
