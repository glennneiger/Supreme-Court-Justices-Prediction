we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
segal,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
segal,
at
--
at
what
precise
point
in
this
procedure
did
the
government
lose
its
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
an
action
of
such
as
it's
here,
prosecuted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
of
the
thing
--
things
that's
crossing
my
mind
is
this.
the
--
the
facts
within
the
knowledge
of
the
government
now
might
be
the
same
as
they
were
at
the
time
that
they
were
asked
to
come
into
the
case
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
but
if
the
case
was
under
investigation
by
the
department
of
justice,
needed
necessarily
know
at
that
time
that
--
that
it
knew
all
of
the
facts
and
that
they
wouldn't
change
and
that
there
wouldn't
be
more
upon
which
it
could
base
a
successful
charge
of
conspiracy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
did
you
start
making
this
transfer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
that
your
answer
to
justice
harlan
in
--
is
that
you
did
not
take
it
up
with
the
antitrust
division.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
too
the
dissenters
on
the
commission
indicate
that
there
might
be
antitrust?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
--
and
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
can't
we
have
--
will
declare
that
--
that
there
might
be
a
violation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
he
say
to
them
that
the
government
would
be
debarred
from
--
by
this
--
by
this
order?
that
he
didn't
think
possibly,
there
was
a
violation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
“where”
to
every
other,
all
the
other
specification,
how
about
that
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
--
would
the
government
be
entitled
to
maintain
an
action
in
the
district
court
at
that
particular
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
it
was
the
day
after
the
--
the
order
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
will
your
answer
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
a
day
after
the
order
was
made
as
--
as
it
would
be
if
it
was
--
the
action
was
filed
a
day
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
in
those
circumstances,
does
the
stipulation
in
any
way
weaken
the
government's
case,
does
that
--
does
that
take
away
any
further
rights
that
the
government
had,
that
stipulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
important
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
give
away
any
rights
of
any
kind,
the
stipulation
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question
along
that
line.
suppose
the
commission
had
not
notified
the
department
of
justice
and
had
just
gone
along
and
--
and
made
this
order
in
this
case,
would
your
answer
to
the
question
of
justice
harlan
and
--
and
me
be
exactly
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
you
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
other
words,
the
federal
communications
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
--
on
a
proceeding
of
this
kind,
the
federal
communications
commission
could
act
in
the
backroom
so
far
as
the
department
of
justice
was
concerned
and
the
justice
department
would
be
debarred
from
maintaining
a
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws
after
it
had
decided.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding
and
that
all
three
of
the
parties
involved
in
the
transfer
agreed
to
the
action
of
the
commission.
you
--
you
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
to
be
that's
--
that's
involved,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
don't
think
there
is
any
distinction
between
the
case
of
this
kind
and
--
and
a
comparative
proceeding
where
the
issue,
antitrust
issue
is
raised
before
the
commission
and
decided
by
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
was
not
in
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
a
party,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
raised
by
a
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
would
it
first
be
barred
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
because
i
understood
you
the
other
way,
i
--
i
understood
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
this
action
--
if
this
proceeding
was
pending
before
the
commission,
that
the
government
could
not
bring
an
antitrust
action
against
the
company
for
--
for
the
same
kind
of
conduct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
segal,
we
--
we've
taken
a
lot
of
your
time.
you
may
take
five
minutes
more.(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
--
solicitor
general,
we
took
a
bit
of
your
time
too,
you
may
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
