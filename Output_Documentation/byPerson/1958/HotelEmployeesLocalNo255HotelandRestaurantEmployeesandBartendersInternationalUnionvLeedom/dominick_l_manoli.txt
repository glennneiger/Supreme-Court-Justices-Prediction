mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset
i
should
make
clear,
perhaps
it
hasn't
been
made
clear,
and
as
for
the
chief
justice's
question
that
the
board
throughout
its
23-year
history
has
not
asserted
its
statutory
power
over
hotels
in
the
several
states.
now,
i
think
it
is
not
entirely
without
significance.
as
mr.
brown
has
already
indicated,
that
four
years
before
the
board
decided
the
case,
which
is
now
before
this
court,
the
international
union,
which
is
the
petitioner
here,
appeared
before
the
board
and
at
that
time,
the
international
defended
the
policy
which
it
so
vigorously
attacks
today.
indeed,
i
might
say
that
i
for
one
is
tempted
to
read
--
to
answer
the
arguments
that's
been
made
here
today
by
simply
reading
excerpts
from
the
argument
that
was
made
by
petitioner's
counsel
before
the
board
at
that
time.
now,
at
that
time,
petitioner
argued
before
the
board
that
this
was
a
long-standing
policy
which
had
received
the
approval,
the
endorsement,
not
only
of
the
union,
the
largestunion
in
this
field,
but
as
of
management
as
well
and
of
congress.
secondly,
it
urged
the
board
not
to
depart
from
this
policy.
and
finally,
it
warned
the
board
they
would
be
making
a
serious
mistake
if
it
departed
from
this
policy.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
wisdom
of
the
board's
policy
may
be
open
to
argument,
but
i
suggest,
your
honors,
that
the
pendulum
has
not
swung
so
far
that
this
policy
which
the
union
so
strongly
endorsed
has
now
become
arbitrary,
capricious
and
--
and
beyond
the
board's
policy
to
adopt.
now,
let
me
explore
--
let
me
explore
the
basis
of
this
change
--
change
of
attitude.
initially,
it
is
argued
that
the
board
does
not
have
the
power
to
decline,
would
assert
jurisdiction
on
representation
cases
such
as
this
one.
of
course,
this
argument
goes
beyond
a
hotel.
it
covers
everybody.
and
if
this
argument
is
valid,
then,
of
course,
all
of
the
board's
jurisdictional
window
through
all
the
board's
jurisdictional
standards,
its
administrative
criteria
for
exercising
this
legal
jurisdiction
are
knocked
out,
insofar
as
representation
cases
are
involved.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
only
one
that
went
out,
your
honor,
was
the
--
was
the
standard
relating
to
unions
when
they
were
acting
as
"employers."
now,
if
i
may
by
way
of
anticipation
of
my
argument,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
board
may
never
exclude
a
group
of
employers
as
a
class.
what
i
think
that
decision
stands
for
is
that
in
that
particular
case,
the
reason
which
the
board
had
given
for
excluding
labor
organizations
as
--
when
acting
as
employers
for
excluding
them
as
a
class,
that
those
reasons
were
without
rational
basis
and
both
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinion
agreed
on
that.
but
--
and
then
the
second
part
was
that
the
express
inclusion
of
unions
within
the
--
within
the
definition
of
the
term
employer
in
the
statute
plus
the
legislative
history,
be
it
--
be
behind
that
--
behind
that
precluded
the
board
from
adopting
a
standard
with
respect
--
with
respect
to
the
labor
organizations
when
acting
as
employers,
which
would
exclude
all
of
them.i
suggest,
your
honors,
that
the
teaching
of
that
decision,
the
significance
of
that
decision
is
that
the
critical
factor
is
not
whether
the
board
has
excluded
a
group
of
employers
as
a
class,
but
rather
the
critical
factor
is
whether
the
considerations,
which
underlies
such
a
policy
are
rational
and
within
the
board's
competence
to
make.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
because
where
you
parted
company
there,
it
seemed
to
me,
where
the
minority
or
the
concurring
members
of
the
court
parted
company
from
the
majority
was
on
the
question
whether
the
history
--
whether
the
history
of
the
inclusion
of
labor
organizations
when
--
within
the
definition
of
the
term
“employer”
whether
that
precluded
the
board
from
--
from
--
declined
to
a
certain
jurisdiction
over
them
as
a
class.
the
concurring
members
of
this
court
thought
that
it
did
not.
the
majority
thought
that
it
did.
that
was
the
difference
between
--
that
was
the
crucial
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
so.
i
think
i
may
concede
that
much.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
sometimes
it
may
be
important
in
tasting
food.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
certainly,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
administrative
criteria?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
excludes
all
of
them.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
don't
have
one
that
applies
to
hotels.
now,
conceivably,
the
board
might
--
might
--
if
it
wanted
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
hotels.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
possibly
we
could
use
the
one
say
dealing
with
--
with
office
buildings
where
the
standard
is
200,000.
now,
if
we
took
its
tenure
like
200,000
and
i
haven't
had
figures
about
300,000.
so
if
you
don't
mind
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
i'll
give
you
those.
the
statistics
are
that
there
are
approximately
about
25,000
hotels
in
the
country.
and
of
that
number,
only
6%
--
only
6%
do
a
business
of
300,000
or
more
annually.
so
assuming
that
the
board
did
adopt
such
a
standard
as
300,000,
we
would
cover
approximately
6%
of
the
25,000
hotels.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
may
not
--
it
may
not
be,
your
honor.
it
may
not
be
very
burdensome
duty
for
the
board
to
take,
but
i
think
that
there
are
considerations
--
there
are
considerations
which
point
the
other
way.
and
namely,
if
i
may
briefly
summarize
it,
the
board
has
thought
of
the
fact
that
which
has
made
for
the
exclusion
of
the
industry,
have
made
for
exclusion
of
the
industry
as
a
whole.
and
secondly,
if
the
board
were
to
adopt
such
a
standard,
that
i
just
suggested,
300,000,
we
would
be
taking
control
or
regulating
a
--
a
disproportionately
small
fraction
of
the
industry.
and
that
it
may
well
appear
to
the
board
that
on
that
it
is
better
to
leave
them
on
an
equal
footing
rather
than
take,
let's
say
a
very
disproportionate
small
percentage
of
the
industry
as
a
whole.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i'm
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
--
in
the
union
case
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
the
burden
would
be
what?
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
misunderstood
the
connection.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
oh,
that's
quite
true.
that's
quite
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
though
at
times
consuming,
too,
your
honor,
just
like
they
perhaps
they
--
they
don't
present
a
series
of
problems
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
this
case
is
due,
but
these
cases
do
present
more
than
simply
the
problem
of
holding
an
election
and
counting
of
votes.
they
very
frequently
involve
some
very
serious
legal
questions,
size
of
units,
contract
bar
questions
and
other
questions.
and
many
of
these
cases
go
to
the
board
itself.
go
to
the
board
itself,
the
five-member
board
for
final
decision.
and
i
might
say
that
the
case
load
--
the
case
load
is
very,
very
great
with
respect
representation
cases.
that
it
is
also
with
respect
to
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
as
--
during
--
currently
--
currently,
our
case
load
is
running
approximately
1000
per
month
and
roughly
60%
of
that
figure
are
representation
cases
and
i
don't
have
the
percentage
of
those
of
which
ultimately
reach
the
board
for
decision,
but
the
percentage
is
substantial.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no.
and
there
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
a
--
that's
a
fact,
your
honor.
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is,
your
honor,
without
having
a
full
record,
but
these
are
those
potential
problems
involved.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
others?
i
don't
have
that
--
those
figures,
your
honor.
i
know
what
the
tests
are,
but
i
don't
have
the
percentage.
i
don't
have
the
percentage.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we
have.
we
have,
after
the
congress
voted
us
in
several
substantial
increase
in
our
appropriations,
we've
expanded
and
partly,
in
response
to
this
court's
suggestion
in
guss.
in
guss
that
we
tried
to
eliminate
as
much
of
this
no-man's-land
that
has
existed
--
that
existed
in
this
--
in
this
field.
now,
to
continue
with
the
argument
that
the
board
is
required,
the
board
is
required
to
--
to
entertain,
process
representation
petitions.
we
think
that
that
argument
is
insubstantial.
and
if
i
may
very
briefly
summarize
our
position
on
that,
then
i
will
go
on
and
speak
about
hotels.
in
essence
--
in
that,
the
board
--
the
board
from
its
--
from
the
very
beginning
of
its
history
as
the
--
asserted
the
problem
not
to
exercise
its
statutory
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt.
prior
to
1950,
it
did
this
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
since
1950,
that's
done
so
on
the
basis
of
former
administrative
standard
which
had
adopted.
now,
essentially
--
essentially,
the
board's
practicing
this
with
respect
the
rest,
i
think,
upon
necessity.
the
--
from
the
very
beginning,
from
the
very
beginning,
and
this
has
been
a
continuing
practice,
the
board
has
been
compelled
as
chairman
herzog
once
testified
before
a
congressional
committee,
the
board
has
been
compelled
to
avoid
a
diffusion
of
its
resources
and
facilities
and
to
allocate
its
time
and
energy
in
such
a
manner
as
we're
permitted
to
do
it
to
carry
out
its
function
in
the
most
effective
manner,
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
permitted
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
the
magnitude
of
the
test
before
the
board,
i
think,
is
indicated
as
i
said
by
a
moment
ago,
by
this
current
case
in
load
that
exceeds
1000
per
month
and
our
backlog
at
the
end
of
fiscal
1958
was
over
6000
cases,
and
quite
recently,
the
present
chairman
of
the
board
testified
before
the
congress
that
if
the
board
has
to
do
is
work
in
an
effective
manner,
its
case
load
should
not
--
it's
backlog
--
its
backlog
of
cases
should
not
exceed
3000
per
year.
now,
the
point
that
i'm
making,
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
about
1000
a
month
they're
running
now,
the
intake
of
cases
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
chairman
said
we
shouldn't
have
a
backlog
of
more
than
3000
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
our
backlog
is,
at
the
end
of
fiscal
1958
was
around
6000
cases,
your
honor.
now,
the
point
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand,
but
we've
gone
back
to
the
congress
today
in
this
last
year.
we
went
back
there
and
we
said
that
in
effect
that
if
congress
wanted
us
to
take
on
more
of
a
load,
it
should
give
us
more
money
so
we
can
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
a
million
and
a
half,
your
honor.
a
million
and
a
half
and
i
might
say
that
we
are
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
the
--
perhaps
that
was
the
--
there
were
other
factors
that
i
won't
mention
here
--
[laughter]
the
--
what
i'm
suggesting,
your
honors,
is
that
in
the
court's
power
to
decline
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
they
have,
if
there
were
nothing
else,
sure,
would
have
to
be
implied
from
sheer
necessity.
but
then
we
need
not
rest
upon
that.
the
underlying
theory
of
the
statute,
i
think,
makes
evidences
a
congressional
purpose
not
to
require
the
board
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt.
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
because
i
haven't
got
the
time.
we've
set
it
forth
in
our
--
we've
set
it
forth
in
our
--
our
brief.
congress
has
repeatedly
looked
into
the
board's
policies
with
respect
to
decline
to
assert
its
statutory
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt.
between
1948
and
1950,
at
least
three
different
congressional
committees
looked
into
this
problem
and
they
did
nothing
about
it.
now,
the
argument
is
made
that
--
that
section
9,
section
9
of
the
statute,
unlike
section
10
which
deals
with
--
which
deals
with
unfair
labor
practices
and
section
9
which
deals
with
representation
cases
is
phrased
in
mandatory
language.
now,
you
--
and
that
because
it's
phrased
in
mandatory
language,
the
board
cannot
decline
to
process
representation
and
petitions
unless
they
are
of
a
de
minimis
character.
now,
there
are
several
answers
to
this
contention.
in
the
first
place,
one
would
have
supposed
that
in
the
face
of
the
board's
23-year
history
of
declining
to
assert
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt.
its
legal
power
to
the
hilt
whether
over
representation
cases
or
unfair
labor
practices,
one
would
have
supposed
that
in
the
face
of
that
history,
there
would
be
some
mention
of
this
problem
in
connection
with
section
9
that
congress
intended
to
change
that
policy
and
yet,
there
is
not
a
word
about
it
in
either
the
legislative
debates
or
the
legislative
history.
secondly,
it
would
be
something
of
an
anomaly
to
force
the
board
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt
in
representation
cases,
and
yet
permit
the
board,
and
petitioner
acknowledges
the
board
has
this
power
and
yet
permit
the
board
to
decline
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt
and
the
unfair
labor
practices
which
looks
to
the
enforcement
of
the
certification.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
it
did,
your
honor.
it
--
it
changed
the
wording,
but
i
venture
to
say
that
we
cannot
look
merely
to
the
word
--
use
of
the
word
“shall”
and
stop
right
there.
looking
to
the
statute
as
a
whole,
if
particularly
--
if
particularly
in
the
--
in
the
light
of
the
absence
of
any
talk,
of
any
talk
by
congress,
that
it
meant
to
change
this
20
--
as
i
say
this
policy
of
the
board
extending
back
for
22
years
of
not
asserting
its
jurisdiction
to
the
full.
looking
at
it
in
that
light,
i
think
that
there
is
an
explanation
of
why
congress
changed
it
from
“may”
in
the
wagner
act
to
“shall”.
and
the
explanation,
i
believe,
lies
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
inland
empire
case.
in
that
case,
which
was
decided
in
1945,
the
problem
came
up
whether
the
board
could
hold
a
representation
hearing,
which,
of
course,
is
part
of
the
investigation
after
the
election.
the
board
did
that
for
reasons
i
won't
go
into
at
the
moment.
it
held
an
election
and
then
subsequently
held
a
--
the
hearing
with
respect
to
the
contentions
of
the
parties
as
to
units
and
what
have
you.
this
court
--
this
court
said
that
the
statute
did
not
require
the
board
to
hold
the
representation
hearing
prior
to
the
election.
indeed,
the
statute
didn't
require
the
board
to
hold
an
election
at
all,
that
the
board
could
determine
whether
a
union
was
a
representative
of
a
particular
group
of
employees
on
the
basis
of
something
other
than
an
election.
now,
i
think,
although
i
cannot
point
to
any
legislative
history
that
supports
this,
my
--
my
own
--
my
own
notion
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
was
designed
to
meet
that
problem.
in
other
words,
it
was
designed
to
make
the
board
hold
a
representation
hearing
prior
to
the
election
and
it
was
also
designed
to
preclude
the
board
from
certifying
a
union
except
on
the
basis
of
--
of
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
--
sir,
this
section,
your
honor,
was
simply
not
--
they
were
not
concerned
with
this
problem.
it
would
be
unreal.
it
would
be
unreal
to
say
that
congress
in
here
--
in
this
particular
section
of
the
statute
intended
to
change
to
what
i've
--
to
what
i've
characterized
as
a
22-year-old
policy
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
declining
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt
in
representation
cases
without
saying
a
word
about
it
in
the
legislative
debates
and
the
legislative
history.
such
a
change
would
have
been
so
significant
that
it
could
not
have
escaped
comment
and
there
is
no
comment
in
the
legislative
history
on
this
problem.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we
do.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we
do.
and
the
reason
we
do
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
we
take
him
in
the
--
we
take
him
in
the
district,
your
honor,
because
as
we
read
our
statute,
we
have
plenary
power.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we've
--
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
do.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
none
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
we
were
like
a
state
board
within
the
district.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i'm
getting
to
them
right
now.
and
before
i
get
to
the
reasons,
i
would
like
to
say
this
as
a
preliminary
matter
that
i
think
the
problem
before
this
court
in
this
case
is
not
whether
this
--
this
court
or
any
other
reviewing
court
would
make
the
same
kind
of
a
policy
judgment
with
respect
to
a
hotel
that
the
board
has
made.
indeed,
i
think
that
our
problem
here
is
not
whether
even
the
board's
decision,
policy
is
a
wise
one,
but
rather,
the
question
here,
whether
this
is
a
permissible
judgment
within
the
board's
competence
to
make.
and
in
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
our
present
standard,
the
hotel
industry
is
the
only
one.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
under
our
present
standards.
we
have
had
other
--
other
industries
over
which
we
have
declined
to
assert
our
jurisdiction
generally
among
them
under
in
the
wagner
act
based,
for
example,
with
the
construction
industry,
local
transit,
taxi
cabs,
hotels,
and
so
forth,
but
under
--
our
standards
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
only
the
hotel
is
the
only
one
on
the
board's
present
standard.
that's
right.
now,
let's
examine
the
reasons
which
underlie
the
board's
policy
with
respect
to
hotels.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear,
by
now,
that
we
do
not
deny
--
we
do
not
deny
that
--
that
the
hotel
industry,
generally,
is
beyond
our
legal
power
and
it
may
well
be
that
many
hotels
come
within
our
statutory
jurisdiction.
but
saying
that
--
saying
that,
nevertheless,
the
hotel
industry
as
a
whole
does
have
what
might
be
phrased
as
a
--
“an
essentially
local
flavor”.
the
industry
here
is
--
the
business
of
the
industry
--
the
business
of
the
industry
is
furnishing
of
lodgings,
furnishing
of
lodgings
to
more
or
less
transient
customers.
and
the
business
as
a
whole
is
composed
of
relatively
small
units.
as
i've
indicated
earlier
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
of
the
25,000
hotels
in
this
country,
85%
of
these
hotels
do
a
business
of
less
than
100,000
per
year.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
gross,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
dollars.
that's
dollars
[laughs]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
there
in
a
decision
they
issued
about
there
on
the
virgin
island
case
issued
in
1955
or
there
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i've
examined
that
decision
of
the
board
in
virgin
islands,
and
i'm
afraid
i
cannot
give
you
an
explanation
or
a
rational
distinction
between
the
two,
and
i
will
not
attempt
it.
the
--
now,
to
continue
then
with
the
reasons
which
underlie
the
board's
policy
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
mean
that.
i
cannot
venture
on
my
own
a
rational
explanation
why
we
don't
take
jurisdiction
over
hotels
in
the
virgin
islands.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
yes,
it
did.
but
we
(voice
overlap)
continue
our
--
well,
we
still
continue
to
assert
plenary
jurisdiction
over
hotels
within
the
district.
and
i
have
to
say,
“i
cannot
advance
any
rational
explanation
for
the
difference
between
taking
jurisdiction
over
hotels
in
the
district
and
not
taking
them
in
the
territories.”
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
perhaps
someday
i
would
(inaudible).
the
--
now,
a
still
further
factor
that
i
think
that
has
played
a
part
in
the
(inaudible)
and
here
as
to
this
policy,
has
been
the
fact
that
the
industry
as
a
whole
has
enjoyed
and
i'm
quite
aware
of
the
difficulties
that
had
been
going
into
and
the
case
was
argued
before
this
one.
but
the
industry
looked
at
as
a
whole
and
over
the
years
has
enjoyed,
a
relatively
stable,
labor
relations
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
had
me
a
study
made
of
that,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
could
give
it
to
you
accurately.
but
in
my
recollection
here,
that
these
larger
hotels
are
in
the
cities
--
in
miami
area,
also
in
the
new
york
area
and
the
chicago
area
and
that
and
beyond
the
west
coast,
most
likely.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
state
of
florida?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
would
not
suggest
that
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
a
further
factor
that
i
think
has
played
a
part
in
the
board's
--
in
the
board's
appearance
to
as
far
is
has
been
the
fact
that
as
i've
mentioned
before
that
this
has
received
a
whole-hearted
--
its
approval,
or
at
least
support,
at
least
until
this
case
are
both
labor
and
management.
indeed
--
indeed,
representatives
of
both
labor
and
management
in
1948
appeared
before
congress
when
the
board's
then
general
counsel
indicated
that
he
was
going
to
assert
the
statutory
jurisdiction
of
the
board
to
the
hilt
and
issue
complaints
involving
hotels.
representatives
of
both
this
union
and
of
management
went
before
congress
and
strangely
opposed.
then
it
changed
in
the
board's
policy.
and
indeed,
in
1951,
they
came
before
the
board
itself
and
are
advanced
in
support
of
the
board's
policy.
all
the
arguments
which
i
am
making
today
in
support
of
that
policy.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
1951.
now,
finally
--
finally,
i
think
there
is
cogent
evidence.
there
is
cogent
evidence
of
the
legislative
proof
of
the
board's
policy
and
let
me
mention
those
very
briefly.
in
1947,
when
congress
was
considering
to
amend
--
to
taft-hartley,
the
suggestion
was
made
that
the
board's
policy
had
left
it
in
doubt
as
to
whether
hotels
came
within
the
board
jurisdiction
or
not.
and
the
suggestion
was
made
that
an
amendment
be
passed,
which
in
effect
would
require
the
board
to
depart
from
its
policy
and
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
hotels.
nothing
came
of
that
proposal.
second
--
secondly,
in
1940
--
in
1948
--
in
1948,
when
the
board's
then
general
counsel,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
indicated
a
purpose
to
assert
the
board's
jurisdiction
to
the
hilt
in
the
issuance
of
complaints,
both
representatives
of
management
and
of
the
union
went
before
a
congressional
committee
and
opposed
to
any
of
the
parts
from
the
board's
policy
and
the
upshot
of
that
was
at
that
committee
approved
to
the
board's
policy.
again,
in
1949,
senator
taft,
it's
true
that
this
comes
after
--
after
the
act
was
passed
and
i
think
we
cannot
minimize
--
we
cannot
minimize
the
views
of
a
man
like
senator
taft
on
this
piece
of
legislation.
in
1949,
senator
taft,
in
answer
to
a
specific
question
put
to
him
on
the
floor,
the
senate
not
only
implicitly
approved
the
board's
policy,
but
went
even
so
far
as
to
say,
and
while
we
ourself
don't
take
the
position,
but
it's
indicative
of
this,
approved
of
board's
policy,
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
didn't
think
that
the
hotels
were
intended
to
be
covered
by
this
statute.
now,
more
recently
--
more
recently
in
1955,
as
a
result
of
the
difficulty
that
the
union
has
been
experiencing
in
florida
which
have
been
brought
to
this
court,
in
the
case
that
was
argued
before
this
one,
senator
lehman
introduced
a
bill
which
would
in
effect
have
required
the
board
to
assert
it's
jurisdiction
over
hotels.
nothing
came
of
that
either.
now,
taking
all
of
these
factors
into
account,
we
believe
that
the
judgement
which
the
board
has
made
here
is
a
permissible
one
which
lies
within
its
competence
to
make.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
1955,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
it's
in
our
brief.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
that
wouldn't
satisfy
me,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
now,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
a
fact
that
the
no
man's
land
about
which
there
has
been
so
much
expectation
is
a
creation
of
the
board.
and
part
of
that
no
man's
land
is
occupied
by
hotels.
and
i
--
we
are
asking
this
court
to
at
least
remove
the
hotels
from
the
no
man's
land
that
has
been
the
board's
own
creation.
we
say
that
the
9
(c)
language
is
mandatory
and
i
think
i
have
a
better
theory
as
to
why
it
was
made
mandatory,
even
if
the
explanation
is
not
given
in
the
congressional
record.
at
the
time
the
taft-hartley
act
was
instituted,
was
passed,
certain
procedures
were
added.one
was
of
this
certification
procedure.
another
was
an
--
a
--
an
election
procedure
on
the
request
of
management.
it
is
my
opinion
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
make
sure
that
these
procedures
would
--
these
new
procedures
would
be
available
and
it
therefore,
changed
the
language
from
“may”
to
“shall”
in
order
to
make
sure
that
these
procedures
would
definitely
be
available,
would
not
be
discretionary
with
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
american
hotel
association
took
the
same
position
that
we
did
in
the
--
in
the
st.
louis
case.
i
think
it
furnished
counsel,
mr.
brownell
to
--
brownell
to
argue
that
case.
and
even,
there
mr.
brownell
admitted
as
you
will
see
in
our
brief
or
in
the
record
that
the
board
did
have
jurisdiction
over
hotel.
