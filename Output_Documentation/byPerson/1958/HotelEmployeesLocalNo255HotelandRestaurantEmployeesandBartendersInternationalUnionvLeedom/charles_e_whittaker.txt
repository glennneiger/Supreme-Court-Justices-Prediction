justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
i
ask
in
that
connection,
sir.
is
that
your
position
both
with
respect
to
9
(b)
proceedings
as
well
as
10
(c)
of
unfair
labor
practice
procedure,
please?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
based
wholly
or
only
partially
upon
the
fact
that
9
(b)
has
mandatory
words,
10
(a)
only
empowers
words?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let
me
see
--
see
if
i
understand
that,
do
you
say
then
the
board
shall
not
have
discretion
as
to
whether
it
will
institute
unfair
labor
practice
complaints
as
to
a
complete
industry?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
you
file
complaints
--
somebody
in
the
courts
have
some
control
over
when
the
commission
shall
affirmatively
--
the
board
shall
file
a
complaint,
you
argue
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
argue
that
the
courts
have
control
over
the
situations
in
which
the
board
must
file
complaints?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
let's
do
not
use
the
words
take
jurisdiction
unless
we
must
for
what
i'm
concerned
about
now,
that
has
relationship
to
me
to
9
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(c)
proceedings,
but
the
matter
of
instituting
a
complaint,
who
can
compel
the
board
to
do
so?
is
there
anyone?
can
the
courts
do
it?
justice

wouldn't
part

take
the
position
