mr.
j.
w.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
right
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
exclude
the
entire
hotel
industry
from
the
operation
of
the
act.
you
have
heard
in
the
earlier
cases
some
detail
of
how
the
case
originally
arose.
frustrated
and
somewhat,
bewildered
in
miami,
the
union
ultimately
turned
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
obtain
the
election,
which
it
was
singularly
unsuccessful
in
getting
in
miami.
although
one
must
say,
we
certainly
tried.
the
board
--
the
regional
director
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
dismissed
our
petition
for
certification
without
hearing
and
without
investigation.
he
did
so
on
the
ground,
as
he
stated,
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
a
long
standing
policy
not
to
take
jurisdiction
in
the
hotel
industry
as
such.
you
have
heard
some
of
the
details
of
the
miami
case
that
gave
rise
to
our
subsequently
filing
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
against
the
hotels
that
were
involved
and
it
might
illuminate
a
question
asked
earlier
to
say
that
we
did
allege
dismissals
of
strikers
and
employees
for
union
activity
and
we
did
allege
in
these
charges
blacklisting.
these
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
we
--
we
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
it
was
shortly
after
the
case
has
started.
they
were
still
somewhat
in
the
temporary
injunction
stage.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
in
--
in
our
case,
no.
the
--
the
board
has
so
ruled
in
the
st.
louis
hotel
association
case
to
the
same
effect.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
that
was
1952.
we
filed
these
petitions
in
1955.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
it
is
true
that
this
union
has
on
occasion.
it
has
been
on
both
sides
of
the
fence.
its
consistency
has
been
in
its
inconsistency.
at
times,
the
--
the
union
has
complained
that
the
ad
hoc
treatment
given
it
by
the
board
was
not
satisfactory.it
took
some
cases
and
did
not
take
some
cases.
and
then
in
1952,
in
the
st.
louis
hotel
association
case,
this
union
asked
the
board
not
to
--
and
to
exercise
a
discretionary
authority
and
not
take
jurisdiction.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
argued
that
case
myself
and
i
am
arguing
today
in
exactly
a
contrary
thing
from
bitter
experience,
the
most
bitter
appeal
of
which
was
miami,
florida
where
we
were
so
completely
frustrated
that
only
the
board's
relief
was
the
--
the
only
thing
we
could
think
of
other
than
a
long
history
in
court,
what
you
can
see
we've
had.
so
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
that's
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
that's
correct.
after
1952,
the
board
has
never
taken
jurisdiction
in
a
hotel
case.
now
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
since
1952
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
yes,
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
think
--
yes,
in
the
district
of
columbia,
too.
it
hasn't
taken
any
either.
well,
no,
i'm
not
so
certain
about
it.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
but
i
think
there
have
been
some
cases
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
--
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
but
they
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
in
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
that
is
correct.
the
board's
position
has
not
been
consistent
either
even
with
regard
to
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
when
--
and
our
charge
that
was
filed
with
the
board
was
dismissed
subsequently
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
on
the
basis
of
the
board's
dismissal
of
our
certification
proceedings.
the
same
policy,
he
said,
extended
to
his
division.
we
filed
a
--
a
suit,
the
complaint
with
the
district
court
here,
asking
that
a
declaratory
judgment
be
granted
finding
that
the
board
may
not
withhold
this
processes
from
an
entire
group
of
employers
on
the
sole
ground
that
those
employers
are
hotels.
we
also
asked
that
the
board
be
directed
to
extend
its
processes
to
us.
the
district
court
found
that
it
had
jurisdiction
of
the
case,
but
it
granted
a
summary
judgment
against
us.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
the
judgment
with
judge
fay
dissenting.
i'm
not
going
to
burden
you
with
the
record
of
interstate
commerce
in
miami,
florida,
but
just
briefly
supplementing
what
has
been
said.
that
record
indicates
a
substantial
effect
of
the
hotels
which
we
sought
to
represent
upon
commerce.
we
were
-–
we
filed
464
hotels.
we
said
that
the
unit
concerned
was
6000
employees
and
there
were
many,
many
more
outside
the
unit
that
we
claim.
the
hotel
industry
is
the
largest
in
all
of
south
florida.
it
has
a
sales
volume
annually
of
$2.5
million
--
two
--
$101
million
and
has
2.5
million
visitors
annually
from
outside
the
state.
the
package
tour
method
is
used
in
selling
the
business
of
the
trip
to
miami.
the
eastern
airlines
sold
55,000
of
these
package
tours
in
1954
alone
and
these
tours
include
hotel,
meals,
transportation
back
and
forth
to
miami.
now,
no
one
can
argue
very
soundly
that
the
hotel
industry
is
either
local
in
nature
in
miami
or
that
the
hotel
industry
of
miami
does
not
have
a
substantial
impact
upon
commerce.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
it
is
our
position
that
the
hotels
do
not
--
that
the
board
does
not
have
the
jurisdiction
or
the
discretion
to
decline
to
take
jurisdiction
over
hotels
because
they
are
hotels.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
in
any
degree
other
than
of
course
the
de
minimis
rule
which
is
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no.
it
is
not
our
position
with
regard
to
both.
we
say
that
the
--
the
--
in
its
language,
of
9
(c)
is
mandatory
and
that
the
board
does
not
have
discretion
to
turn
down
a
certification
case.
we
also
say
that
10
(a),
the
unfair
labor
practice
section
is
discretionary
with
the
board
and
that
the
board
does
not
have
to
handle
every
unfair
labor
practice
case
which
presents
itself
anymore
than
a
prosecutor
must
press
a
prosecution
of
every
complaint
that
comes
to
him.
he
uses
his
discretion
in
those
instances
and
determines
whether
it's
willful
intent
and
so
on.
some
of
them
are
very
minor,
of
course.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
yes.
that
--
our
position
is,
first,
that
there
is
not
--
that
hotels
are
employers
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
there
is
no
exemption
of
hotels
in
this
act
that
is
before
you,
section
22
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
defining
employers.
when
congress
intended
to
exempt
a
particular
employer,
it
named
that
industry
in
the
act.hotels
are
not
so
named
in
the
act.
so
we
say
that
they
come
within
that
definition.
then
we
go
on
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
9
(c)
section,
we
say
that
that
section
is
mandatory.
once
it
is
established,
you
are
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
which
we
say
hotels
are,
then
the
board
shall
take
jurisdiction.
it's
the
way
the
statute
now
reads.
it
formally
read
under
the
wagner
act
period,
“may
take
--
may
investigate,
may
conduct
an
election.”
but
that
language
was
changed
in
1947
to
read,
“the
board
shall
investigate,
shall
hold
the
hearing,
shall
conduct
an
election
and
shall
certify
the
results
of
that
election.”
on
that
basis,
we
say
that
the
board
does
not
have
any
discretionary
authority,
barring
of
course,
that
de
minimis
rule
to
withhold
its
jurisdiction
from
anyone
covered
by
the
act
and
hotels
are
in
that
in
that
category.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
yes.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
that
is
my
position.
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
intention
of
the
law.
the
board
couldn't
--
by
a
--
an
obvious
indiscretion
of
that
sort,
an
arbitrary
decision
say
we're
not
going
to
handle
unfair
labor
practices
of
the
hotels.
it
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no.but
it
could
do
this.
if
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
arose
out
of
a
hotel
case
and
it
might
be
one
individual
claiming
he
was
blacklisted.
such
was
our
complaint
in
miami.
the
board
could
listen
to
the
story
of
the
complainant
and
it
could
determine
whether
that
particular
complaint
and
that
particular
case
had
such
an
impact
on
commerce
or
whether
it
was
of
such
importance
that
it
warranted
further
proceedings.
but
it
could
not
say
to
anyone
complaining,
“you,
your
case
arises
out
of
the
hotel
and
therefore,
we
will
not
take
jurisdiction
in
your
case.”
mr.
j.
w.
brown
yes,
i
would
say
that
the
board
does
not
have
that
authority.
now
as
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no,
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not.
the
language
of
the
act
is
very
broad
and
discretionary
with
regard
to
its
--
the
board's
right
to
process
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
in
the
first
instance,
that
is
given
to
the
general
counsel.
i
only
say
to
you
that
if
the
general
counsel
made
a
ruling
saying,
“i
will
not,
under
any
circumstances,
take
jurisdiction
in
a
case
arising
out
of
a
hotel.”
i
would
say
that
that
determination
would
be
as
arbitrary
as
the
one
of
which
i'm
complaining
and
that
the
courts
should
set
it
asides.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
9
(c),
actually,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no,
i
don't
think
the
courts
can,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
i
--
i
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
i
agree.
if
i'd
given
that
impression
that
i
think
the
courts
can
compel
that
complaint
i
don't
think
that's
so.
i
don't
anymore
than
a
prosecutor
can
be
compelled
to
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
--
present
a
case
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
now,
our
position
in
this
case
is
based,
first,
on
office
employes
decided
by
this
court.
we
say
that
office
employees
controls
ours
squarely.
we
say
that
in
that
case,
you
held
that
the
union
was
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
and
then
you
went
on
to
say
that
the
board
may
not
exclude
an
entire
class
of
employers,
even
the
partial
dissent
in
office
employes
said
that
while
an
entire
class
of
the
employees
conceivably
could
be
excluded
from
the
operation
of
the
act,
such
exclusion
would
have
to
be
for
a
valid
reason.
in
office
employes,
no
such
valid
reason
was
found
and
the
result
of
the
case
was
a
unanimous
concurrence
in
the
result.
now,
before,
i
have
indicated
to
you
that
the
industry
in
miami
is
a
--
consider
--
has
a
considerable
impact
on
commerce
and
i
--
before
applying
office
employes
to
our
case,
i
want
to
correct
one
misapprehension
which
may
have
gotten
around
inadvertently.
and
that
is
that
the
board
has
ever
found
that
the
board
has
never
found.
it
is
our
contention
the
board
has
never
found
that
the
hotel
industry
is
local
in
character.
there
is
no
such
finding
anywhere.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
the
--
senator
taft's
statement
took
place
in
1949.
the
--
he
was
announcing
to
the
world
his
opinion
of
what
the
taft-hartley
act
meant.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
which
had
been
enacted
two
years
earlier.
and
i
might
say,
it
was
with
full
knowledge
that
the
greenbrier
case
was
pending.
but
then
that's
--
i
really
shouldn't
make
the
statement
because
it's
not
in
the
record.
but
having
been
a
little
bit
involved
in
some
of
the
earlier
history
of
this
conflicting
position
of
our
own
union,
i'm
aware
of
what
went
on.
for
instance,
is
senator
taft's
colloquy
with
senator
pepper
anymore
impressive
as
to
what
the
act
meant
at
the
time
of
enactment
in
1947,
than
the
colloquy
of
the
five
senators
which
took
place
in
1955,
which
colloquy
was
quite
the
contrary
of
the
taft-pepper
discussion
on
the
florida
senate.
senators
lyman,
i
believe,
morse,
humphrey
and
a
few
others.
and
i
am
free
to
admit
that
they
were
fully
aware
of
our
miami
beach
case.
and
i
suggest
that
if
you
read
the
colloquy
between
senator
pepper
and
senator
taft,
you
can
--
you
get
sense
that
it
was
a
sort
of
inspired
colloquy.
now,
is
it
determinative
of
what
the
law
meant
in
1947?
i
suggest,
no.
and
we
say
that
there
is
no,
not
a
single
word
in
the
record
preceding
he
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
law
indicating
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
hotels
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
not
a
single
word
recognizing
what
the
board
claims
was
its
long-standing
policy
since
1935,
that
it
did
not
take
jurisdiction
over
hotels.
no
evidence
exists
of
this
long-standing
policy.
prior
to
1949,
the
first
time
it
was
ever
publicly
announced.
and
when
i
say
no
evidence,
i
mean,
not
in
the
annual
report
of
the
board,
not
in
any
of
its
press
releases
and
not
in
any
of
the
recorded
cases.
so
how
could
congress
have
--
or
anyone
else
have
known
of
a
policy
of
the
board
not
to
take
jurisdiction?
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
taking
jurisdiction
in
the
greenbrier
case
was
for
the
purpose
of
announcing
that
policy
for
the
first
time,
and
that
--
that
it
wasn't
done
too
successfully
in
the
greenbrier
case
and
so
they
had
to
take
jurisdiction
again
in
the
st.
louis
hotel
association
case
to
clarify
it
and
make
it
clear
that
they
were
not
going
to
take
jurisdiction
over
hotels
as
such.
in
greenbrier,
they
made
a
mistake
of
also
talking
about
effectuating
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
you're
right,
your
honor,
i
did,
and
i
regret
it
to
this
day.
but
i
represented
the
client
that
looked
--
and
you
might
understand
this.
in
those
days,
in
1947
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
passed,
unions
were
somewhat
horrified
and
frightened
by
many
--
had
problems
that
perhaps
didn't
come
to
pass
ultimately.
and
they
--
what
they
didn't
know
frightened
them.
and
so
the
position
of
unions
was
one
of
expediency
and
our
union
was
in
that
category.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no,
sir.
your
honor,
we
are
on
law.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
we
--
we
took
the
position
of
expediency
then,
we
found
out
that
we
were
wrong,
we
found
out
that
we
could,
perhaps,
live
with
some
of
the
taft-hartley
features
and
that
it
had
certain
advantages
too.
and
when
--
now,
we
--
in
1955,
we
sought
the
use
of
the
board's
authority.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
because
we
felt
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
that
might
have
been
our
opinion,
your
honor.
we
felt
in
those
days
that
there
were
a
lot
of
penalties
in
this
new
law
and
we
felt
that
we
would
make
a
sacrifice
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
yes,
exactly.
we
thought
we
would
still
clear
the
penalties
and
give
up
the
advantages.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
well,
may
i
say
that
not
all
of
them
have
appeared,
your
honor.
at
least,
we
have
found
--
effected
a
new
balance
of
the
merits
and
the
demerits
in
this
matter.
now,
your
honor,
the
--
the
st.
louis
case
was
turned
on
this
point.
i
--
i
might
say
that
our
case,
the
board
declined
jurisdiction
based
on
the
st.
louis
case.
in
the
st.
louis
case,
which
affects
us,
the
board
held
that
the
reason
it
would
not
take
jurisdiction
was
because
congress
had
intended
to
exempt
the
hotel
industry.
it
reasoned
in
this
fashion.
you
can't
find
the
exemption
in
the
law,
but
it
reasoned
this
way.
our
policy
has
been
of
long-standing.
it
was
known
to
congress
in
1947.
when
congress
reenacted
the
basic
national
labor
relations
act
in
1947
it,
therefore,
reestablished
our
policies
and
wrote
them
into
the
law
in
effect.
now,
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
pardon?
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no,
i
did
not
make
that
argument
to
the
board.
when
i
argued
in
1952,
you
mean?
mr.
j.
w.
brown
in
1952,
i
did
not
argue
that
at
all.
i
simply
said
that
the
--
i
was
suggesting
that
the
board
use
its
discretionary
authority
to
--
not
to
take
jurisdiction
in
our
case.
and
i've
made
it
very
plain
that
we
--
we
felt
that
the
board
did
have
jurisdiction,
but
i
urged
only
the
discretionary
position.
now,
the
policy
of
the
board's
--
though
incidentally,
the
position
that
the
board
took
in
st.
louis
hotel
association
case
and
in
our
case
in
1955,
is
its
position
today.
two
months
ago,
the
board
announced
its
rules
--
of
the
jurisdictional
rules,
terminations
that
it
uses
to
determine
whether
it
will
take
a
case,
and
it
indicated
that
it
would
not
take
jurisdiction
over
hotels
and
in
making
that
indication
it
said,
and
i
quote
from
page
15
of
our
brief,
"the
board's
long-standing
refusal
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
hotel
industry
itself
has
rested
on
the
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
the
hotel
industry."
now,
i've
indicated
the
false
assumptions
that
the
board
made
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
the
hotel
industry.
first,
there
never
was
any
long-standing
policy.
it's
never
been
recorded
anywhere.
and
secondly,
the
only
recorded
cases
are
once
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
board
did
take
jurisdiction.
and
since
the
board
was
talking
about
hotels,
as
such,
as
an
industry,
it's
inconsistent
that
they
took
jurisdiction
over
any
hotels,
whether
they
were
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
not.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
that
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
well
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
yes,
but,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
again,
they
are
post
--
post
enactment
situations.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
are
you
referring
to
the
--
what
year?
mr.
j.
w.
brown
current
--
oh,
currently.
well
if,
your
honor,
please,
the
board
has
always
assumed
that
it
has
the
--
a
discretionary
authority.
now,
congress
in
applying
9
(c),
even
though
the
language
of
9
(c)
is
mandatory.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
now,
it
has
persuaded
--
it
has
gone
to
congress
and
said,
“either
we
do
have
jurisdiction
or
we
just
--
but
we
can't
--
we
simply
can't
handle
it
with
the
funds
we
have
and,
therefore,
there's
a
limitation
on
our
exercising
or
doing
our
duty
under
the
law
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
oh,
what
i
don't
recognize
as
the
board
made
any
--
had
any
discussion
on
industry
classification.
the
classification
was
on
a
--
the
basis
of
size.
it
was
a
question
of
how
far
down
the
ladder
they
went.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
but
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
classification
of
industry
because
i
don't
know
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
i
--
i
don't
know
them
--
of
them
representing
that
to
congress,
your
honor.
i
have
one
more
point
that
i
want
to
make
before
saving
about
two
or
three
minutes
for
rebuttal.
and
that
is
that
section
9
(c)
of
the
act
is
mandatory.
i've
indicated
how
the
language
was
changed
in
1947.
the
"mays"
in
9
(c)
were
changed
to
“shall”,
and
i've
indicated
that
if
the
board
has
found
a
commerce
impact
in
the
case,
it
has
no
discretion.
the
board
will
argue
that
--
that
the
history
of
the
act
doesn't
support
the
language,
but
that's
quite
a
novel
theory
that
the
history
must
support
the
language.
if
the
language
is
clear,
i
think
it
stands
on
its
own
feet.
the
board
will
--
will
also
argue
that
certification
is
only
preliminary
to
--
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
procedure
and
that
if
they
have
discretion
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
section
of
--
under
10
(a)
that,
therefore,
they
should
have
discretion
under
9
(c).
we
say
that
that
is
entirely
fallacious
that
the
certification
procedure
is
equally
important
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
procedure,
that
it
is
not
merely
preliminary,
it's
a
separate
division,
a
separate
function
of
the
board
and
that
it
is
perfectly
proper
for
the
board
to
--
the
congress
to
grant
discretion
in
one
case
and
make
the
other
--
that
is
the
unfair
labor
practice
end
of
it
--
and
to
make
the
handling
of
certifications
a
mandatory
function
of
the
board.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
no,
they
were
debates.
they
were
debates,
but
no
hearings
that
are
--
no
hearings.
first,
i
rise
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
statutory
considerations
are
not
at
all
behind
the
board's
policy
of
excluding
hotels.
the
board
has
plainly
stated
its
policy
and
i
think
i
read
it
to
you.
you
may
have
missed
it.
it's
on
page
15
of
our
brief.
the
board
--
the
--
the
board
has
--
the
statement
of
the
board
that
it
has
been
its
administrative
policy,
and
hereto
since
1953,
the
--
the
board's
long-standing
refusal
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
hotel
industry
has
rested
on
a
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
the
industry.
now,
that
statement
is
two
months
old
and
that
is
the
basis.
but
there
are
no
budgetary
considerations.
mr.
j.
w.
brown
we've
referred
to
company
at
least
as
far
this
court
is
concerned.
we
rubbed
shoulders
in
many
other
regards.
[laughter]
now,
coming
to
the
hotel
industry
as
a
whole,
the
hotel
industry
is
not
a
small
local-in-nature
industry.
it's
does
$2.5
billion
business
per
year.
it
employs
more
than
500,000
persons.
our
record
indicates
it
is
the
seventh
largest
industry
in
the
united
states
and
over
--
and
half
the
hotels
doing
more
than
$500,000
business
per
year
account
for
half
of
that
$2.5
billion
in
sales.
there
are
some
giants
like
the
sheraton
chain,
the
hilton
chain.
the
sheraton
does
$150
million
per
year.
the
hilton
chain
does
$200
million
per
year.
this
is
a
local-in-nature
industry
that
counsel
would
have
you
to
say
is
not
the
concern
of
the
board.
the
--
mr.
j.
w.
brown
at
least
we
are
not
alone
in
our
inconsistency
with
regard
to
the
--
this
entire
matter.
the
board
has
joined
us
at
least
in
--
in
the
virgin
islands
and
in
other
places.
