justice
felix
frankfurter
now
you're
on
principles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
posit
effect,
it's
like
this
form
that
you
push
your
position
because
you
didn't
want
to
get
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
board
--
did
the
board
pass
a
fortiori?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
heard
of
at
the
time.
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
our
problems
have
--
out
of
the
case
that
you're
now
finding
more
reason
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
brown,
may
i
ask
you
this?
that
before,
the
board
reasoned
enunciate
this
or
understand
this
assumption
of
the
cases.
am
i
wrong
in
recalling,
that
that
power
representation
before
the
appropriate
--
appropriations
committee
by
the
board
that
they
will
take
more
cases
and
they
will
relax
some
of
their
restrictions
if
congress
gives
them
more
money?
and
congress
did
appropriate
more
money.
thereupon,
the
board
says,
“we
now
have
more
money,
therefore,
we
can
have
more
conclusions,
therefore
we
have
more
facilities
and
therefore
it
will
be
wiser,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what's
the
variable
of
that
on
the
intention
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
for
these
matters
--
these
--
that
i
am
dreadful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
20
of
the
chairmen
or
whoever
spoke
to
the
board.
but
i
gather
from
what
i
have
read
that
that
was
put
before
the
committee
in
the
congress
as
a
reason
for
their
restricted
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
then
responded
to
them.
even
the
matter
must
have
been
or
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
there
were
before
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
this
is
not
post-enactment.
this
is
an
appropriation
which
as
much
a
legislative
action
as
a
bill
is
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
referring
to
1958.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
our
duty,
we're
talking
about
(inaudible)
of
classifying
the
cases
that
we
obtain,
not
picking
them
one
by
one,
but
classifying
and
saying
we
have
limited
resources
of
men
and
materials,
we
can't
do
all
of
it.
therefore,
impliedly,
there's
authority
in
us
to
effectuate
the
statutes
by
--
by
taking
--
taking
those
discrimination
that
will
best
enforce
the
law
and
(inaudible)
more
amenable
than
some
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
one
--
that's
one
of
its
distinctions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
in
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
--
you're
making
me
feel
that
the
concurring
dissented
opinion
under
that
with
four
of
us
is
quite
redundant,
and
all
of
a
sudden,
they're
confederates
of
majority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
i
think
we
restricted,
if
i
understood
you,
the
court's
decision
to
the
specific
situation
before
the
court,
namely
(inaudible)
and
they
would
also
--
unions
present
the
employers
but
this
flavor
of
majority,
this
have
to
very
different
(inaudible)
of
this
redundancy,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
as
having
flavor
in
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
as
the
burden
on
the
board
is
concerned,
the
burden
would
be
more
or
less,
if
the
officers
has
gone
the
other
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
burden
on
the
--
on
the
board's
facility
in
time,
et
cetera,
appropriation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
guessing
that
the
burden
probably
would
be
less
if
the
officers
are
subject
with
--
if
the
burden
would
be
less,
but
the
officers
will
be
put
on
to
your
jurisdiction
in
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
the
officer's
case.
the
office
building
--
the
office
building
or
the
union
--
the
union
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
number
of
cases
in
the
(inaudible)
the
volume
of
business
that
we're
asking
will
come
to
you
now
on
the
assumption
that
unions
are
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'd
like
to
(inaudible)
am
i
wrong
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
there
some
questions
also
that
the
procedure
of
the
elections
of
different
situations?
there
isn't
a
uniform
procedure
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
your
case
but
these
are
not
now,
needing
to
be
tried
in
this
date
on
or
the
other
but
that
is
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
expanded
them
now,
haven't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
(inaudible)
what
would
it
be
in
years
or
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
four
times
as
much
as
the
chairman
said
you
can
(inaudible)
these
cases?yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
that
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
merely
a
million
dollars,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
congress
say
a
million
and
a
half?
justice
felix
frankfurter
over
the
district,
you
say
it
more
or
less.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that
was
different.
that
would
take
care
of
your
differentiations.
that
would
take
care
of
your
points,
that
you
--
you
don't
want
to
take
on
your
practice
at
the
end
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
have
to
concern
it
but
--
therefore
taking
care
of
the
point
that
if
--
if
this
jurisdiction
is
requested
by
the
petitioner,
you'd
be
taking
only
a
small
fraction
if
it
isn't
--
where
the
district
can't
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
(inaudible)
as
well
as
the
united
states,
and
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you
would
say
apparent
difference
as
to
state
it
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
be
the
more
rational
than
the
virgin
islands.[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
--
wouldn't
it
satisfy
you
that
(inaudible)
the
facts
of
the
board
to
give
a
more
rational
