mr.
brown,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
relation
to
these
cases
that
we
have
just
heard,
that
the
board
hold
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction?
was
it
before
or
after
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
after
they
started?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
first
--
is
that
the
first
time
the
--
they
had
ever
ruled
on
--
on
that
definitively?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
counsel
in
the
other
case
to
say
that
this
union
had
consistently
refused
to
admit
the
--
that
the
board
had
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli?
chief
justice
earl
warren
officers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
that
time
--
at
that
time,
didn't
the
board
represent
in
congress
that
--
that
it
didn't
need
any
more
money
to
carry
out
its
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
we
found
that
in
the
guss
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
they
carry
the
same
thing
through
to
--
to
section
10
that
use
the
word
“shall”
there
as
well
as
“may”
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
they
use
--
didn't
that
two
words
set
off
against
each
other
have
some
meaning
in
9
and
10?
i
think
not,
your
honor.
and,
again,
i
come
back
to
my
explanation
that
congress
left
section
9
--
section
10
rather,
as
it
was
in
the
original
act,
said
"empower".
but
when
they
came
to
section
9,
they
were
concerned
with
different
kind
of
a
problem.
they
were
not
thinking
of
section
9
if
that
was
a
test
in
permissive
terms
and
it
is
my
own
--
my
own
view
--
my
own
view
that
what
congress
was
concerned
here
was
to
make
clear
what
section
9
had
not
made
--
had
either
not
made
clear
or
simply
was
the
other
way.
and
namely,
that
they
want
to
make
sure
that
the
board
would
hold
an
election
prior
to
or
--
or
to
conduct
the
investigation
including
the
representation
hearing
prior
to
the
--
to
the
election.
and
secondly,
that
the
board
could
not
issue
a
formal
certificate
as
it
had
been
doing
under
the
wagner
act
on
the
basis
of
--
of
cards
that
it
would
have
to
issue
a
certification
solely
on
the
basis
of
a
board
election.
and
i
think
if
that
section
was
designed
to
--
to
reach
only
that
problem
and
no
more.
now,
let
me
go
on
now
to
the
board's
hotel
policy.
as
i
said
earlier,
this
policy
has
been
the
board's
policy
throughout
its
history.
the
board
has
not
asserted
jurisdiction
over
hotels
in
the
several
states.
it
has,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
we
have
asserted
jurisdiction
over
hotels
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
until
recently,
in
the
--
in
the
territories.
now,
this
policy
of
the
board
is
part
of
its
overall
program
of
utilizing
its
time
and
its
energies
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
take
care
of
all
the
hotels
in
the
district
regardless
of
size
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
do
you
have
any
de
minimis
rules?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
have
you
done
the
same
thing
in
the
other
--
in
territories
to
--
which
have
a
state
government?
let's
take
the
virgin
islands.
i
--
i
understood
that
over
there,
the
board
had
refused
to
take
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
you
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
distinction
there
between
--
between
the
district
of
columbia,
let
us
say
and
--
and
there,
you
--
you
justified
or
keep
the
distinction
between
the
district
of
columbia,
the
other
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
least,
this
state
does
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
their
hearings
were
supportive
of
that
bill?
