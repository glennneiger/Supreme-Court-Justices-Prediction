--
it's
true
that

justice

that
they
exercised
their
discretion
for
a
while,
at

not
to
take

elsewhere

mr.
brown,
even
under
10
(a),
which
of
course
is
not
corrected
here,
i
suspect.
but
it's
your
position,
is
it
not
that
even
though
there
may
be
discretion
in
the
board
under
10
(a)
as
to
unfair
labor
practices,
the
board
would
not
be
warranted
in
so
exercising
its
discretion
as
to
exclude
a
whole
industry
just
because
it
happens
to
be
a
particular
industry.
is
that

your
position?
justice

any
more
than
they
could
--
would
say
we're
not
going
to
handle
unfairly
labor
practices
of

which
had
been
enacted

so
we
can
also
assume
that
this
could
not
be
a
stupendous
burden
for
the
board
in
its
financial
or
personal
--
or
personal
resources?
justice

in
that
connection,
mr.
manoli,
may
i
ask
you
this?
is
there
any
other
entire
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce
over
which
the
board
has
refrained
from
exercising
any
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
only
one.
justice

it
remains
today
only
the
hotel
industry.
justice

that's
dollars,
not

justice

it
has

of

no
