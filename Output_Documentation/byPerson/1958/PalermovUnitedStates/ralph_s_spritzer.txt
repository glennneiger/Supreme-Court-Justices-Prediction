mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
your
honors.
i
do
not
like
to
take
an
undue
amount
of
time
in
discussing
the
facts
of
the
case
in
as
much
as
the
court
does
have
statutory
and
constitutional
questions
before
it.
however,
in
as
much
as
the
government's
position
on
the
statute
has
already
been
elaborated
in
the
proceeding
case,
particularly,
in
relation
to
its
application
to
memoranda
or
summaries.
i
think
perhaps
that
it
may
be
helpful
to
attempt
to
place
the
issue
as
to
production,
as
it
arose
in
this
case,
more
clearly
in
its
setting.
and,
i
do
wish
to
review
very
briefly
the
nature
of
the
proof
and
to
indicate
the
theories
of
the
prosecution
and
defense
and
precisely
how
this
issue
arose
and
how
it
was
handled
by
the
court.
in
view
of
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
figures,
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
chart
which
has
several
tables
in
it.
now,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention,
if
i
may,
at
the
outset,
that
this
case
involves
tax
evasion
not
merely
for
the
year
1951,
but
for
three
years,
1950
to
1952
inclusive.
and,
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
on
all
three
counts
and
that
concurrent
sentences
were
handed
down.
now,
actually,
the
proof
went
back
beyond
1950
and
showed
that
the
pattern
of
under
reporting
went
back
at
least
as
far
as
1948.
the
first
table
on
this
form
which
i've
submitted
to
the
court
is
simply
drawn
from
the
tax
returns,
and
it
shows
a
comparison
of
the
income
reported
by
dr.
palermo
on
his
original
return
with
the
income
which
he
ultimately
reported
on
his
amended
return
for
the
same
year.
he
filed
amended
returns
for
these
five
years
in
1956,
some-four
years
after
the
tax
investigation
by
the
internal
revenue
agents
began.
the
court
will
observe
the
discrepancy
as
between
the
amounts
reported
on
the
original
and
the
amended
returns.
perhaps,
the
biggest
variation
is
in
1951,
$9000
reported
originally,
$31,000
ultimately
reported.
now,
the
second
table
shows
dividend
income
returns,
and
we
have
that
table
here
because
the
under
reporting
was
concentrated
in
the
area
of
under
reporting
of
dividends.
the
other
area
was
under
reporting
of
capital
gains
on
the
sale
of
securities.
now,
the
court
will
see
from
table
2
that,
in
1950,
for
example,
14,000
in
dividends
was
reported.
the
actual
figure
should
have
been
33,000
in
dividends.
in
1951,
the
variation
is
13
against
30.
the
least
discrepancy
is
in
1952,
and
the
1952
return
was
filed
after
the
treasury
agents
had
begun
an
investigation
into
taxpayer's
1951
returns.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
his
amended
return.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
these
are
conceded
figures
now
filed
by
the
taxpayer.
in
every
year,
except
1952,
far
less
than
half
of
dr.palermo's
dividends
were
reported
and,
of
course,
as
the
first
table
indicates,
far
less
than
half
of
his
net
income
was
reported.
but,
actually,
that
doesn't
begin
to
give
the
full
picture.
one
can
narrow
this
evasion
to
a
smaller
area.
dr.
palermo
bought
stock
in
two
ways.
he
bought
it
on
margin
through
margin
accounts
and
he
bought
it
outright.
stock
bought
on
margin,
of
course,
does
not
become
the
registered
stock
of
the
buyer.
it
remains,
in
the
term
of
the
trade,
in
street
name
and
the
dividends
on
such
margin
stock
go
to
the
broker
and
not
directly
to
the
ultimate
purchaser.
as
a
result,
all
of
the
dividends
on
the
margin
account
purchaser
--
purchases
went
through
the
brokers
and
the
brokers
kept
regular
formalized
records,
and
they
submitted
monthly
statements
to
the
--
to
dr.
palermo.
now,
of
course,
those
regularized
monthly
statements
would
be
readily
acceptable
to
any
tax
investigator.
there
was
not
evasion
in
respect
of
the
dividends
received
on
securities
bought
on
margin.
the
evasion
was
concentrated
in
the
area
of
the
securities
which
were
bought
outright,
the
securities
that
the
doctor
had
in
his
vault,
which
he
might
have
been
holding
for
six
months
or
a
year
or
five
years.
the
figures
in
table
3
show
the
under
reporting
of
dividends
on
stock
which
was
owned
outright
by
dr.
palermo.
here
is
a
man
who
received,
in
1950,
over
$18,000
in
dividends
on
his
outright
owned
securities.
the
figure
he
gave
the
accountant
as
representing
his
dividends
for
that
year
was
4000
on
such
securities.
in
1951,
the
discrepancy
is
over
20,000
received
and
3800
reported
as
representing
dividends
on
this
class
of
securities.
table
4
on
our
chart,
over
which
i
shall
not
linger,
indicates
the
amount
of
capital
gain
on
the
sales
of
securities
which
were
not
reported.
one
further
word
about
the
under
reporting
of
dividends,
the
outright
owned
securities
were
held
some
in
the
name
dr.
palermo
and
others
in
the
names
of
nominees
-
dr.
palermo's
mother,
a
niece,
a
former
lady
employee.
it
was
conceded
that
all
of
the
dividend
checks
which
were
made
payable
to
these
nominees
were
endorsed
and
cashed
by
dr.palermo.
it
appears
that
at
no
time
were
any
of
the
dividends
received
by
these
nominees
reported
by
the
doctor.
now,
i
come
to
the
question
of
how
the
doctor's
tax
returns
were
prepared
and,
to
the
--
briefly,
to
the
evidence
on
that
point.
as
the
court
has
heard,
the
doctor's
brother-in-law,
sanfilippo,
was
an
accountant.
sanfilippo's
partner,
amoruso,
was
a
friend
of
the
doctor
also,
some-30
years
standing.
they
both
testified.
dr.palermo
did
not
testify,
so
we
have
nothing
from
him
as
to
his
relationship
with
his
accountants.
both
the
accountants
testified
and
they
both
said
that
they
never,
at
any
time,
made
any
investigation,
any
audit
or
any
form
of
accounting
inquiry
into
the
figures
which
represented
the
doctor's
dividends
on
the
securities
which
he
owned
outright.
as
to
the
margin
account
stocks,
they
got
--
he
furnished
them
his
broker's
monthly
statement.
as
to
his
other
stocks,
held
in
his
name
or
by
his
nominee,
they
got
the
information
from
him
and
they
took
the
figures,
they
testified,
as
submitted.
they
said
they
weren't
paid
to
make
an
audit.
that
they
relied
on
the
figures
which
he
gave
them.
normally,
they
said
those
figures
were
provided
to
them
over
the
telephone.
now,
i'd
point
out
parenthetically
that
even
if
contrary
to
the
testimony
of
the
accountants,
they
had
information
accessible
to
them
so
that
they
should
have
known
that
he
was
grossly
understating
his
income,
assuming
that
they
were
winking
at
the
evasion,
that
would
hardly
serve
to
exonerate
the
doctor
who
gave
them
these
grossly
inadequate
figures,
who
stood
to
profit
by
it,
and
who
must
have
known,
i
submit,
that
he
was
hardly
paying
the
taxes
that
were
due.
in
one
year,
for
example,
dr.palermo
had
over
$30,000
in
dividends,
as
well
as
income
from
his
medical
practice,
income
from
rents
on
properties
that
he
owned,
more
than
$30,000
of
dividends,
i
emphasize,
and
he
paid
a
total
tax
of
less
than
$2000.
was
he
unaware
of
what
was
going
on?
i
must
defer
on
the
suggestion
that
he
filed,
“gave
blank
checks
to
his
accountants
and
signed
all
of
his
returns
in
blank,”
because
the
evidence
only
supports,
in
our
view,
including
the
references
cited
by
petitioner
in
his
brief,
that
one
--
the
return
in
one
year
was
signed
in
blank.
but,
all
of
this
apart,
let
us
consider
the
government
exhibit
6,
the
document
by
which
the
defense
seeks
to
suggest
fault
or
complicity
on
the
part
of
the
accountants.
your
honors
have
seen
the
report
--
the
form,
i
should
say.
it's
a
blank
form
of
the
kind
that
a
brokerage
firm
gives
out
to
customers
so
they
can
note,
in
daily
journal
form,
the
dividends
that
they
receive.
now,
there's
no
question
that,
at
some
point,
the
accounting
firm
received
this
report
--
this
form,
and
the
question
is
just
when
it
was
received,
it
being
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
there
was
error.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
our
primary
argument
in
all
of
these
cases
is,
of
course,
that
summaries,
as
distinguished
from
substantially
verbatim
transcripts
or
signed
statements,
are
not
producible.
and,
i've
been
giving
this
because
it
bears
both
on
any
question
of
harmless
error,
if
there
was
error,
and
--
but
there
was
not
error
is
our
first
argument.
i've
been
giving
it
with
that
partly
in
mind,
but
also,
since
there
has
been
some
discussion
of
the
fact
to
the
try
to
give
the
benefit
of
--
the
court
the
benefit
of
understanding
the
precise
issue
or
production
as
each
developed.
and,
i
am
gradually
trying
to
focus
in
on
that.
as
i
say,
the
question
as
to
this
steiner-ralls
form,
so-called,
it's
the
sort
of
stature
your
honors
have,
is
when
the
accountants
got
it.
the
defense
suggests
that
if
the
accountants
got
it
before
march
15,
1952
that,
then,
they
were
negligent,
at
the
least,
in
showing
$3800
in
dividend
on
outright
owned
securities
because
this
form,
if
you
add
up,
shows
some
$16,000
in
dividends
on
outright
owned
stock
for
1951.
now,
i
think
there
are
various
circumstances
which
support
sanfilippo's
testimonies
that
this
was
not
available
to
the
firm
in
1951.
in
the
first
place,
as
the
court
has
noted,
this
is
a
continuing
daily
journal
kind
of
entry
and,
if
the
doctor
submitted
he
has
paid
this
paper
to
the
accounting
firm
which
normally
took
some
weeks
at
least
to
makeup
his
return,
presumably,
he'd
start
a
fresh
piece
of
paper
to
show
his
1952
dividend,
but
this
continues
uninterrupted.
in
the
second
place,
there
was
the
testimony
of
amoruso
who
supervised
the
preparation
of
the
return
for
1951.
and,
he
testified
that
the
doctor
gave
him
the
$3800
figure
which
was
in
the
worksheets
and
found
its
way
into
the
return,
that
the
doctor
gave
him
the
$3800
figure
over
the
phone,
and
that
he
never
saw
this
paper
when
he
prepared
the
1951
return.
in
the
third
place,
we
find
that
dr.palermo,
himself,
has
never
claimed
that
he
gave
this
form
to
the
accountants
before
the
tax
return
of
1951
was
filed.
agent
harper,
the
same
agent
who
subsequently
spoke
to
the
witness
sanfilippo,
interviewed
dr.
palermo.
dr.
palermo
told
harper
that
he
could
not
recall
when
this
form
was
given
to
the
accountants.
the
only
suggestion
that
the
accountant
had
it
in
1951
or
in
early
1952,
when
the
1951
return
was
prepared,
is
by
a
lady
who
worked
in
the
firm,
mrs.lacombe,
whose
testimony,
far
from
being
unequivocal,
showed
a
great
deal
of
confusion.
she
testified
that
she
had
seen
this
form,
she
thought,
when
the
1951
return
was
made
out.
she
also
testified
that
that
was
when
a
mr.
degeorge,
another
employee
of
the
firm,
worked
there.
when
it
was
pointed
out
to
her
that
mr.
degeorge
did
not
work
there
until
a
considerably
later
date,
she
finally
testified
at
record
292,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
top
half
of
the
page,
that
it
could
have
been
in
1952
or
it
could
have
been
in
1953.
now,
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
1951
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
part
of
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
because
this
dividend
list
is
on
outright
owned
security.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and,
the
amended
return
has
the
figures
from
the
broker.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
list,
however,
is
--
is
incomplete
as
to
outright
owned
securities
itself
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1952,
the
accountants
used
this
part
of
the
form
to
get
the
taxpayer's
dividends
and
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
tax
evasion
in
1952
because
he
didn't
write
all
his
dividends
down
here
and
at
no
point
were
the
dividends
paid
to
nominees'
reporting.
moreover,
in
1952,
he
had
a
$10,000-capital
gain
that
wasn't
reported.
but,
i
emphasize
this
because,
in
the
next
year,
this
form
was
used
as
a
basis
for
preparing
the
return
and
the
jury
found
him
guilty
in
that
year
as
well.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
very
paper
was
used
by
the
accountants
the
next
year.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
this
was
not
the
only
--
no,
i
think
it
goes
on
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
goes
on
later
thereafter,
it
is
which
--
or
later
in
the
year.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
final
column.
it's
a
rather
difficult
paper
to
read.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
testified
that
she
knew
she
worked
with
the
paper
at
some
point.
now,
after
the
tax
investigation
of
petitioner's
affairs
began
in
december
1952,
the
accounting
firm
did
work
to
determine
whether
the
1951
return
was
accurate.
they
wanted
to
find
out
what
additional
was
owing
and
there
would
have
been
just
as
much
reason
for
her
to
go
over
the
dividends
then
as
at
any
prior
time.
and,
that
brings
me
to
sanfilippo's
testimony
and
the
effort
to
impeach
sanfilippo,
of
course,
is
the
effort
which
leads
to
the
issue
as
to
production
in
this
case.
now,
sanfilippo
testified
on
more
than
one
occasion,
and
i
would
like
to
take
his
statements
chronologically.
on
july
16,
1956,
sanfilippo
was
interviewed
by
agent
harper
for
some-three
hours.
a
transcript
to
that
interview
was
made.
it
became
available
to
the
defense.
the
court
has
copies
of
it,
marked
y
(7).
at
pages
32
and
33
of
that
transcript,
sanfilippo
said
to
agent
harper
that
he
didn't
recall
when
he
got
this
steiner-ralls
form
or
when
he
first
saw
it.
the
next
month,
in
august
of
1956,
sanfilippo
returned
to
the
agents'
offices
and
was
with
them
for
some-three-and-a
half
hours.
at
this
interview,
sanfilippo
examined
the
transcript
of
the
prior
july
interview.
he
made
certain
corrections
which
appear
of
the
face
of
that
transcript
and
any
initial
of
those
changes.
at
that
second
meeting
with
agent
harper,
he
executed
a
supplementary
affidavit
that
was
made
available
to
the
defense,
and
the
court
has
that
as
exhibit
z7.
sanfilippo
said
that
he
--
well,
outspoken
in
part,
he
said
in
that
supplementary
affidavit
“i
recall
that
mr.
mishler,”
mishler
was
the
first
revenue
agent
who
looked
into
the
taxpayer's
affairs,
his
investigation
having
began
in
december
1952.
“i
recall
that
mr.
mishler
requested
additional
information
concerning
the
doctor's
dividend
income
and
i
believe
that
dr.palermo
supplied
me
with
this
form
with
a
notation
of
dividends
at
that
time.”
now,
the
record
shows
mishler
was
a
witness,
that
mishler
commenced
his
investigatin
in
december
1952,
that
he
called
upon
dr.palermo
at
that
time
to
come
in
and
reply,
if
he
would
talk
about
his
tax
affairs,
and
that
mishler
questioned
dr.palermo
in
december
1952
as
to
apparent
discrepancies
in
dividend
income.
now,
the
next
time,
the
third
time
that
sanfilippo
spoke
about
the
date
of
receipt
of
the
steiner-ralls
memorandum
was
before
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
minutes,
over
the
government's
objection,
were
made
available
to
the
defense
in
this
case.
they're
marked
w
(7).
and,
at
page
28,
sanfilippo,
quite
consistently
with
his
supplementary
affidavit,
told
the
grand
jury
that
the
firm
received
the
steiner-ralls
dividend
form
after
the
commencement
of
the
tax
investigation
by
mr.
mishler.
and,
at
page
29,
he
says
he
did
not
see
it
prior
to
preparation
of
the
1951
return.
but,
finally,
we
come
to
the
trial.
again,
sanfilippo
testified
that
he
did
not
have
this
dividend
form
when
preparing
the
1951
return
and
that
it
was
his
recollection
that
palermo
--
dr.palermo's
submission
of
this
form
was
precipitated
by
the
action
of
agent
mishler
in
december
1952,
calling
palermo
in
and
questioning
him
about
his
dividends.
sanfilippo
also
explained
how
his
recollection
came
to
be
refreshed.
he
said
that,
after
the
july
meeting
with
agent
harper,
he
went
back
and
talked
with
his
partner,
amoruso.
it
then
came
back
to
him,
he
said,
that
the
occasion
of
their
receiving
this
form,
and
usually
they'd
receive
figures
from
the
doctor
over
the
phone,
sometimes
lump
sum
figures.
it
came
back
to
him,
he
said,
that
the
occasion
of
receiving
this
form
was
that
concern
had
been
engendered
by
mishler's
interrogation
of
dr.
palermo.
mishler
emphasized,
when
he
called
dr.palermo
in,
that
there
were
apparent
discrepancies
of
dividend
income.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
talking
about
his
trial
testimony
now.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
149
and
150
has
a
portion
of
that,
your
honor.
now,
at
this
point,
the
defense
had
received,
had
seen
the
question-and-answer
transcript
of
the
first
interview
with
harper,
the
supplementary
affidavit
prepared
at
the
second
interview
with
harper,
and
the
grand
jury
minutes
with
sanfilippo's
testimony.
the
defense
then
sought
any
memorandum
of
the
august
1956
meeting
which
agent
harper
might
have
made.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
advised
the
court
that
the
government
had
no
statement
--
no
approved
statement
and
no
transcript
of
matter
that
sanfilippo
had
said
at
the
meeting
in
august
with
agent
harper.
the
assistant
advised
the
court
that
he
had
a
memorandum
which
agent
harper
had
prepared
after
that
meeting.
he
said
it
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
transcript.
the
court
asked
defense
counsel
on
what
basis
he
thought
he
was
entitled
to
production
of
the
memorandum,
indicating
that
the
court
did
not
believe
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
it
if
it
were
a
memorandum.
now,
defense
counsel
did
not
seek
to
challenge
the
representation
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
that
this
was
merely
a
memorandum.
he
accepted
that
representation.
i
think
i
can
say
that
with
confidence,
when
the
record
shows,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
record
153,
counsel
stating
in
a
colloquy
with
the
court,
the
court,
“mr.
newcomb,
how
do
you
hope
to
bring
yourself
within
3500
(e)?”
and
mr.
newcomb
says
“i
do
not
hope
to
bring
myself
within
it.
i
do
not
think
i
belong
within
it.”
and,
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
defense's
reliance
was
on
the
proposition
that
the
statute
doesn't
control
that
there
may
be
some
provision
for
getting
it
outside
the
statute,
or
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
say
that,
in
this
case,
there
can
be
no
question
of
procedure
to
determine
whether
the
memorandum
is
in
fact
a
summary
or
is,
perhaps,
a
substantially
verbatim
transcript,
though
it
appears
to
be
a
summary,
because
there
was
no
challenge
made
to
the
representation
that
it
was
a
summary.
now,
it
does
not
clearly
appear
that
judge
--
from
the
transcript,
at
the
time
of
the
colloquy,
that
judge
dimock
read
it
at
that
time.
there's
no
statement
in
the
record
that
it
was
handed
off,
so
i
can't
say
that
he
read
it
at
that
time,
though
the
record
shows
that
the
assistant
told
the
court
it
was
there
for
him
to
see.
i
assume
that
judge
dimock
did,
at
some
point,
examine
it
because
he
took
care
to
send
it
forward
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
court
exhibit
so
that
that
court
could
examine
it.
the
court
of
appeals
did
examine
it
and
it
found
that
the
internal
evidence
made
clear
that
it
was
a
summary
or
memorandum
and
not
a
substantially
verbatim
transcript.
this
court,
of
course,
has
the
--
has
that
court's
exhibit
2,
the
field
exhibit,
before
it.
and,
this
court
can
consider
that
internal
evidence
as
well.
this
court
could
also
consider
whether,
if
on
any
theory
the
memorandum
should
have
been
produced,
it
would
serve
any
purpose
to
grant
a
new
trial.
if
it
appears
on
the
face
of
the
document
that
the
only
information
there
doesn't
add
or
subtract
one
whit
from
what
was
stated
in
the
supplementary
affidavit,
which
was
executed
that
day
and
which
was
made
available
to
the
defense,
that
it
couldn't
conceivably
be
of
any
use.
in
that
circumstance,
i
would
certainly
suppose
that
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
ordering
a
new
trial.
now,
i've
gone
into
the
facts
that
i
should
attempt
to
make
clear
in
concluding
that
by
emphasizing
the
facts,
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
in
any
way
that
we
do
not
rely
basically
and
as
our
first
contention
on
the
proposition
that
this
was
a
memorandum
or
summary
and
that
the
statute
prohibited
turning
that
over.
and,
i
haven't
deem
it
necessary
to
attempt
to
argue
further
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
its
plain
application,
it
seems
to
me,
here
only
because
the
government's
position
on
that
score
has
been
fully
elaborated
in
the
preceding
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
we
did.
i
think
that
the
point
is
at
least
conclusive,
however,
on
the
proposition
that
he
--
that
he
could
not
now
be
heard
to
say,
and
i
don't
understand
him
to
say,
he
could
not
now
be
heard
to
say
that
--
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
it
was,
in
fact,
what
it
was
represented
to
be,
namely,
a
summary
or
contemplation.
