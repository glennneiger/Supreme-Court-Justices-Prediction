justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
amended
return,
that
is
his
amended
return
and
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
the
government
complains?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
spritzer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
i
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
the
argument
of
the
previous
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
certainly
don't
want
to
ask
you
to
repeat
it,
but
just
so
i
can
understand,
the
thrust
of
your
present
argument
is
to
show
that
the
exclusion
of
the
--
or
the
failure
to
give
this
to
the
defendant's
counsel
was
not
prejudicial,
is
that
right?
that
if
--
the
error,
it
was
not
prejudicial
error?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
i
understand
you
to
say
this
exhibit
adds
up
to
$1600.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
1951.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
does
that
mean
that,
as
compared
with
the
amended
return,
there's
still
a
discrepancy
of
$1400?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
very
paper
or
similar
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
because
this
only
appears
to
go
through
six
months
of
the
year,
through
june
30th.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
the
grand
jury
testimony?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals,
i
take
it,
notwithstanding
these

justice
john
m.
