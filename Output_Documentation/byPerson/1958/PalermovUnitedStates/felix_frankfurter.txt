could
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say,
because
i
understand
you
to
say,
a
minute
ago,
that
you
agreed
with
judge
dimock
and
this
was
not
within
the
term
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
should
ask
--
what
did
you
say?
did
the
record
show
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
say,
may
i
turn
to
the
documents,
introduce
into
evidence,
and
probably
the
documents
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
relied
on
jencks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
relied
on
jencks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
see
this
as
the
same
way
that
he
did,
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
blaming
you
for
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
what
the
preceding
argument
was,
that
jencks
survived
the
statute
and
that
you
made
the
outside
of
the
statute,
yet,
within
the
jencks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position
now,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
surrender
anything
if
you
intellectually
thought
that.
