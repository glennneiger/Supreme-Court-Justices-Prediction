mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
tax
evasion
case.
the
issue
to
be
determined
here
is
whether
the
trial
court
committed
reversible
error
when
it
denied
a
defense
motion
to
inspect
what
has
been
marked
court's
exhibit
2.
the
case,
in
bare
broad
outline,
was
roughly
this.
the
petitioner's
tax
returns
contain
substantial
understatements
of
income
from
dividends
and
capital
gains.
on
the
trial,
it
developed
that
on
legitimate
business,
the
petitioner
was
away
from
home
each
year
during
tax
time.
he
happened
to
be
the
team
physician
for
a
major
league
baseball
team
and
was
down
south
on
spring
training.
his
returns,
the
tax
return
forms
were
signed
by
him
in
blank.
he
left
in
new
york
checks
signed
in
blank
to
cover
the
payment
of
his
taxes.
his
returns
were
prepared
and
the
blank
checks
were
filled
out
by
a
firm
of
certified
public
accountants
in
which
his
brother-in-law,
arthur
r.sanfilippo,
was
the
senior
partner.
his
returns
were
certified
by
sanfilippo
or
his
partner
and
filed
in
new
york,
together
with
the
checks.
the
returns
were
never
seen
by
the
petitioner
after
they
were
filled
out
nor
copies
--
nor
were
copies
of
them
given
to
or
seen
by
him.
the
defense
in
the
case,
thus,
was
reliant
on
the
accountants.
the
government's
theory
was
that
the
petitioner
had
given
false
information
to
his
accountants
and
he
withheld
true
information
from
them,
and
that
he
had
done
all
this
with
intent
to
evade.
an
important
element
in
the
government's
proof
was
government's
exhibit
6,
and
the
evidence
offered
by
the
government
as
to
when
and
under
what
circumstances
exhibit
6
was
first
received
by
the
accounting
firm.
the
defense
contention
was
that
exhibit
6
was,
first,
delivered
to
the
accounting
firm
early
in
1952
for
use
in
preparing
the
petitioner's
1951
return.
there
was
substantial
evidence
supporting
the
defense
position.
the
government's
theory
was
that
exhibit
6
was,
in
effect,
petitioner's
secret,
a
little
black
book.
that
it
was
withheld
and
concealed
from
the
accountants.
that
it
was
not
produced
by
him
or
given
to
his
accountants
until
after
--
long
after
the
criminal
tax
investigation
of
his
affairs
had
been
begun.
it
is
now
appropriate
to
have
a
look
at
exhibit
6.i've
requested
the
clerk
to
afford
the
justices
a
copy,
and
i've
given
one
to
the
solicitor
general.
it
is
a
list
of
dividends
in
the
doctor's
own
handwriting,
the
petitioner's
own
handwriting.
the
hieroglyphics
or
hand
tracks
are
stock
market
symbols.
the
total
dividends
of
the
pertinent
class
shown
on
exhibit
6
for
1951
is
$16,900
plus.
in
his
tax
return
for
1951,
the
dividends
in
this
class
that
were
reported
were
only
$3800.
needless
to
say,
the
prosecutor
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner
fought
over
that
piece
of
paper,
from
the
beginning
of
the
trial
to
the
end,
like
two
terriers
over
a
bone.
whichever
could
make
off
with
it
would,
in
all
probability,
make
off
with
the
case
as
well.
to
prove
its
position,
the
government
relied
on
the
testimony
of
mr.
sanfilippo,
the
senior
partner
of
the
accounting
firm,
and
elicited
from
him,
on
direct
examination,
the
following
testimony
on
page
27
of
the
record.
the
question
i
show
you,
government's
exhibit,
for
identification,
“can
i
ask
you
to
tell
the
court
and
jury
if
you
have
seen
that
before?”
answer,
“yes.”
question
-
“when
did
you
first
see
it?”
answer,
“during
the
course
of
the
tax
examination
of
mr.
mishler
in
1953.”
question,
“who
gave
it
to
you?”
“the
defendant.”
on
cross-examination,
there
being
doubt
as
to
just
what
sanfilippo
meant
by
“during
the
course
of
a
tax
investigation,”
the
counsel
for
petitioner
pinned
the
witness
down
and,
on
page
81
of
the
record,
it
appears
that
the
witness
testified
that
he
received
it
after
the
agent
asked
for
additional
information
and
after
he,
sanfilippo,
had
asked
the
taxpayer
for
additional
information.
this
testimony
was
absolutely
false
and
demonstratively
so.
and,
without
laboring
the
details
of
the
evidence,
i
refer
the
court
not
only
to
our
main
brief,
but
matters
analyzed
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
which
the
court
may
examine
at
its
leisure.
the
defense,
then,
brought
out
that
the
testimony
of
the
witness
on
this
point
had
vastly
changed.
it
had
begun,
months
before,
with
a
flat
sworn
statement,
“i
do
not
know
when
i
got
this.
i
can't
remember
it.
i
cannot
account
for
it.
i
have
no
recollection.”
one
year-and-a
half
after
that
testimony
was
given,
this
witness
testified
upon
trial
to
a
direct,
clear,
positive,
and
damning
recollection
that
he
got
it
at
a
definite
time
for
a
definite
purpose.
the
process
--
the
story
had
gone
through
a
process
of
evolution.
on
july
16,
1956,
when
he
was
examined
by
the
special
agents
under
oath,
and
this
was
the
first
time
they
ever
asked
him
about
this
exhibit,
he
said
“i
don't
know.
i
don't
remember
it.
i
can't
account
for
it.”
six
weeks
later,
the
special
agents
had
him
in
again,
on
august
23,
1956.
they
showed
him
copies
of
the
doctor's
returns
and
exhibit
6,
and
they
made
him
compare
them.
the
message
was
plain.
whether
or
not
it
was
spelled
out
to
him
is
not
important
now.
if
his
firm
had
exhibit
6
when
the
defendant
claimed
they
had
it,
then
the
firm
had
either
been
guilty
of
negligence
of
the
most
aggravated
character
or
sanfilippo
was
a
co-conspirator,
a
codefendant
in
a
conspiracy
case.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
would
look
at
the
exhibit,
you
will
observe
that
there
are
two
columns
on
the
left-hand
side
and
you
will
observe
that
there
is
written
in,
it's
somewhat
indecipherable,
as
to
each
item
in
1951,
and
only
as
to
each
item
in
1951,
certain
interpretations
of
the
stock
market
symbols.
those
interpretations
were
placed
there
by
mrs.
irene
lacombe,
who
had
been
a
clerk
in
the
sanfilippo's
office.
she
testified
unequivocally
that
she
put
them
there
in
december
1952
while
working
in
preparation
of
the
defendant's
1951
return.
she
was
a
government
witness.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
sir?
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
march
15.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
mr.
justice.
he
said,
and
she
said
it,
she
was
a
government
witness,
and
she
said
it
clearly,
the
government
attorney
immediately
turned
around
and
tried
to
attack
her
--
attack
her
testimony,
and
the
record
is
right
there
for
the
court
to
examine,
and
she
was
clear
and
she
stuck
to
it.
moreover,
i
haven't
the
time
to
analyze
circumstantial
evidence,
but
there
was
other
circumstantial
evidence
indicating
that
this
was
there.
now,
the
government
will
quarrel
with
it.
this
is
a
defense
contention
but
there
was
evidence,
and
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
the
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
march
15
--
or
march
1,
1952.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir,
i
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
i
can
anticipate
your
question.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
the
doctor
and
his
brother-in-law,
as
a
family,
passed
the
documents
back
and
forth
constantly
between
the
doctor
and
his
office
and
the
accountants
and
their
office.
so,
the
--
they
had
this
document
for
1951
early
in
1952,
and
then,
returned
it
to
the
doctor
who
continued
it,
returned
it
again
to
them
in
1952.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
when
this
girl
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
your
honor.
no,
it
does
not,
but
that
is
the
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
significance
of
the
fact
that
mrs.lacombe's
entries
are
only
there
for
1951.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
pardon
me?
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
substantially
so.
there
are
a
few
omissions.
they
consist
of
yearend
dividends
that
were
put
in
1952
or
a
few
minor
omissions.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
evidence
was
that,
and
this
was
conceded
by
the
partners
in
the
accounting
firm,
the
clerks,
and
others,
that
the
doctor's
records
would
go
down
to
the
accounting
firm's
office
where
they
would
be
worked
on
and
then
returned
to
the
doctor
where
they
would
be
continued.
and
then,
when
the
next
year
came
around,
the
documents
go
to
--
go
down
and
come
back.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir,
and
we
had
substantial,
definite,
and
direct
evidence
to
that
effect.
now,
what's
the
time
that
mr.
sanfilippo
finally
--
i
think
you
said
there
were
several
versions
of
his
testimony,
but
when
is
it
he
said
he
finally
got
this
thing?
what's
the
date
he
gave?
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
he
finally
said
he
did
not
get
it
until
after,
approximately,
april
1953,
which
was
after
the
criminal
tax
evasion
investigation
had
been
gone.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
she
left
the
firm
--
i
think
she
was.
there
was
another
girl
who
had
left,
as
early
as
she
did.
if
i
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
now,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
evolution
of
sanfilippo's
testimony,
the
first
date
was
july
16,
1956,
when
he
said
i
don't
know.
the
next
time
was
august
23,
1956,
when
he
signed
an
affidavit
and
he
had
a
conference
with
the
agents.
when
we
reached
that
point
on
the
trial,
we
moved
for
the
production
of
any
memorandum
made
by
the
agent,
showing
what
sanfilippo
had
said
to
him
in
this
conference
with
respect
to
this
subject
matter
and
the
others
on
the
charge.
it
appeared
that
the
conference
lasted
three-and-a
half
hours.
there
was
a
memorandum.
it
consisted
of
four
typewritten
pages.
it
was
dated
the
same
day.
it
was
made
within
several
hours
after
the
conference
by
special
agent
harper.
it
was
later
signed
also
by
special
agent
mcgowan.
it
was
made
under
circumstances
establishing
awareness
on
the
part
of
the
agent
that
the
case
literally
hang
on
what
sanfilippo
was
saying.
unless
the
agent
was
lacking
in
intelligence,
and
he
was
a
very
good
and
fine
and
honest
agent,
he
knew
that
he
was
questioning
a
man
who
would
be
either
a
codefendant
or
the
principle
witness
for
the
government.
according
to
what
we
have
learned
from
the
government's
statements,
it
consisted
--
it
constituted
the
agent's
summary
of
what
he
said.
he
--
and,
under
our
view,
there
is
no
question
that,
unless
defense
counsel
saw
what
was
in
that
memorandum,
unless
counsel
saw
how
this
testimony
had
been
evolved
from
total
lack
of
recollection
to
total
recall
incriminating
the
defendant,
then
he
simply
could
not
get
a
fair
trial.
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
a
trial
lawyer.
the
man
has
told
four
stories.
this
was
when
one
of
them
was
developed.
as
a
trial
lawyer,
i
say
with
deep
sincerity,
and
if
i
am
not
given
access
to
what
that
man
said
to
the
agents
on
this
occasion
in
whatever
form,
it
may
be
recorded,
i
have
been
deprived
of
a
fair
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
witness.
until
i
came
here,
yesterday,
i
felt
strongly
that
the
statute
was
not
exclusive.
i
still
think
that
a
“substantially
verbatim
recital”
can
embrace
a
single
sentence
which
says,
in
substance,
he
said
to
me
so
and
so.
that
could
be
an
intelligent,
reasonable,
constitutional
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
the
government
says
that
that
is
not
so.
i
made
that
point,
but
i
say
to
the
court
that
if,
under
the
circumstances
here
presented,
the
statute
says
that
a
court
cannot,
and
this
court
did
not
even
examine
the
document,
there
is
an
error
in
the
government's
brief,
the
court
did
not
examine
the
document.
it
says
to
me,
“you
cannot
see
it
or
any
part
of
it,”
then,
i
say
that
justice
has
not
been
done.
the
motion
should
have
been
granted,
just
as
required,
no
less.
and,
i
think
that
what
i
am
talking
about
is
due
process
of
law
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
no,
sir.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
he
said
jencks
was
only
impeachment
and
that
this
was
a
document
that
you
couldn't
impeach
with.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
at
the
opening
of
the
argument,
judge
dimock
said
to
me,
“you
are
not
within
in
100
miles
of
the
statute,
are
you?”
and,
so,
i
would
open
and
i
said
“no,
but
i
--
maybe
not,
but
i'm
under
jencks
clearly.”
so,
i
argued
constitutionality.
they
argued
“are
you
jencks?”
i
just
couldn't
make
him
see
it.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
may
it
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
developed,
and
the
government
said,
there
was
such
a
memoranda.
i
think,
as
a
trial
lawyer,
i
was
not
far
off
when
i
took
the
position
that
there
was
anything
that
sanfilippo
said.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
i
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
well,
i
could
certainly
qualify
that
we're
in
agreement,
your
honor.
he
certainly
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
he
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
i
said
i
do
not
think
i
am
with
it
or
i
do
not
hope
to
bring
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
but
i
relied
on
jencks.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
but
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
did
not
say
that,
until
after
judge
dimock
had
said
to
me,
“mr.
newcomb,
you
are
not
within
100
miles
of
the
statute.”
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
no,
sir,
but
we
had
had
the
jencks
case
up
before
in
the
statute,
and
i
sincerely
believe
that
i
made
no
concession
which
was
anything
more
than
a
graceful
act
of
deference
to
a
clearly
indicated
opinion
on
the
trial
court
--
on
the
basis
of
the
trial
court.
however
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
i
understand,
sir.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir,
and
if
the
statute
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
yes,
sir.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
i
--
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
i
think
you're
right,
though,
your
honor.
it
follows
that
the
conviction
below
must
be
reversed
and
there
should
be
another
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
wyllys
s.
newcomb
mr.
justice
and
learned
justices.
i
suggest
that
whether
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
below
examined
the
document
is
something
that
should
not
be
in
issue
here.
in
our
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we've
categorically
stated
that
the
court
did
not
examine
the
documents.
the
appeal
was
argued
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
tried
the
case,
and
the
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
all
upon
the
basis
that
the
court
did
not
examine
the
document.
and,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
simple
check
by
the
solicitor
general
would
suffice.
let
us,
if
the
court
please,
go
back
to
the
fundamentals.
why
are
we
here?
in
examining
sanfilippo,
i
put
to
him
this
question
which
is
the
key
to
why
we
are
here
and,
i
respectfully
say,
it
is
why
this
learned
court
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
said
to
him,
we're
referring
to
exhibit
6,
“mr.
sanfilippo,
i
ask
you
whether
your
memory
of
it
was
better
then,”
namely,
on
july
16th
when
he
said,
“i
don't
know,”
“than
your
memory
of
it
when
you
testified
here
upon
the
trial,
some
16
or
18
months
later,
and
approximately
four-and-a
half
or
five
years
after
you
say
you
received
this
paper.”
he
answered,
“i
feel
my
recollection
of
the
circumstances
is
better
today
because
we
reviewed
that
several
times.”
and
petitioner
does
not
challenge
the
right
or
even
the
duty
of
skilled
investigators
and
prosecutors
to
refresh
recollection
of
witnesses
even
by
using
repeated
and
suggestive
interrogation,
if
honestly
done.
the
prosecution
must
be
vigorous,
determined
and
persistent.
truth
is
not
obtained
from
witnesses
always
in
the
first
instance.
therefore,
the
interest
and
right
of
the
government
is
that
there
should
be
vigorous
investigation
and
prosecution.
but,
as
one
who
has
been
a
prosecutor
local,
state
and
federal
for
many
years,
i
have
long
been
conscious
as
i
am
sure
this
court
is
conscious
of
the
fearsome
power
which
the
skilled
investigator
and
the
skilled
prosecutor
possesses
if,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
a
record
of
a
change
and
evolution
of
testimony
on
a
vital
point.
and
it
appears,
as
a
matter
of
timing,
that
it
occurred
coincidental
with
repeated
interrogation
and
preparation.
this
is
not
an
indictment
of
the
government,
the
prosecutor
or
the
investigator.
but,
i
say
to
the
court,
with
real
sincerity,
that
if
that
is
to
be
done,
as
it
must
be
done,
then
the
defense,
when
it
occurs,
must
be
given
every
reasonable,
fair,
intelligent
opportunity
to
inquire
as
to
whether
it
was
done
and,
if
so,
how
and
when?
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
that
right
in
this
case
was
clearly
denied
to
us.
