what
was
the
occasion
of
this
address?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
objective
of
his
address?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
he
been
talking
about
statutes
or
laws
that
have
been
passed
or
that
he
wanted
to
pass?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
the
parliament
passed
it
or
had
someone
raised
a
question
in
the
parliament
that
they
ought
to
have
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
what
the
speech
was
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
statute
--
is
it
a
statute
in
this
country
which
authorized
it?
if
so,
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know,
i
am
asking
you
the
question
because
you
read
this.
do
they
have
one
in
canada?
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
supplement
what
the
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
to
say
that
to
me
that
probably
another
question
something
like
steel
seizure
case.
do
you
--
do
you
rest
entirely
here
on
the
executive
power
to
promulgate
broad
rules
which
have
the
effective
law,
determining
who
can
and
who
cannot
work
for
private
employee
without
--
without
any
act
of
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
objection,
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
thought
you
will
discuss
it.
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
i'm
interested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
taking
that
--
you're
not
agreeing
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
--
i
don't
remember.
was
that
a
case
of
a
government
employee
or
an
employee
of
a
private
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
--
we're
not
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
any
difference
between
the
power
of
your
board
over
the
employee
of
the
government
and
a
non-employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
asking
you
about
that
distinction,
i
recognize
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
if
you
draw
any
distinction
between
the
power
of
the
government
in
connection
with
employees
of
private
companies
to
cause
a
government
contractor,
employees
of
the
government,
just
what
you
call
an
inherent
power
that
comes
from
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

government
secrets
but
from
government
--
from
employment
with
a
private
company,
it
seems
to
me,
there
ought
to
be
some
difference.
the
government
doesn't
have
to
contract
with
the
client
for
a
certain
private
company
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
president
--
could
the
president
had
promulgated
the
walsh-healey
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
done
it
on
the
ground
that
needed
to
be
done,
interest
in
national
defense
and
security?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wouldn't
think
that
as
in
application
here,
maybe
it
does,
that
was
said
with
reference
to
business
people
who
wanted
to
claim
they
had
a
legally
recognizable
right
to
make
contact
with
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
question
is
whether
the
government
can
invade
this
man's
undoubted
right
to
hold
his
job
unless
there's
some
for
some
legal
reason
the
government
can
have
him
removed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
didn't
have
anything
there
about
the
conditions
of
employment
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
affect
anybody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
make
it
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
your
argument
is
something
like
this.
and
may
lead
to
something
else
in
connection
with
it,
or
may
not.
you
are
saying
it
for
the
good
of
the
public,
public
welfare
demand,
something
be
done
to
this
man
whereby
he
surrenders
for
the
public
good
his
job
with
all
the
losses
that
may
entail
to
him.
now,
if
he'd
owned
the
laundry
as
an
individual
and
done
that
could
you
--
could
you
take
it
with
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
let's
suppose
he
does
on
the
growing
concern,
there's
no
inability
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
take
it
--
take
it
away
from
him
without
paying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
for
that
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
--
that
--
that
wouldn't
be
--
that
wouldn't
a
defense
if
--
if
the
compensation
so
as
it
applied,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
say?
maybe
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
but
would
--
would
it
not
have
something
to
do
with
the
consideration
of
the
whole
subject?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
he
employed
at
will?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
government
had
done
that,
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem
there,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
government
had
employed
him
at
will,
but
what
is
it
that
causes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
to
say
that
he's
entitled
to
due
process.
i
--
i'm
asking
you
that
because
to
me
if
he's
entitled
to
due
process,
it's
one
thing.
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
shrink
it
to
the
dimension
as
it
had
been
suggested
in
one
type
of
case
and
expanded
in
another.
if
he's
entitled
to
due
process
at
all,
how
can
we
say
that
it's
just
the
slight
amount
that
is
suggested
here
by
weighing
each
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
say
he's
not
entitled
to
due
process
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what,
you
mean
no
he
is
--
the
different
ideas
of
due
process
as
you
know
and
all
of
us
know,
do
you
--
are
you
saying
the
government
has
a
right,
i
can
understand
that
argument,
but
for
many
years
the
government
had
fired
whosoever
it
chose
whenever
it
saw
fit,
and
nobody
raised
much
questions
about
it.
are
you
standing
now
on
the
base
that
he
--
he
is
entitled
to
some
of
the
elements
duly
recognized
as
the
part
of
due
process
and
not
entitled
to
others
or
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
merely
non
discriminatory
but
if
you
set
up
procedures
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
if
the
secretary
had
said
in
opinion
in
which
he
said,
“since
i
have
not
had
access
to
the
fbi
files
i
put
those
out
of
my
mind.”
and
i
make
my
determination
solely
upon
the
impression
that
mr.
greene
made
on
me,
assuming
that
he
himself
had
attended
this
hearing,
so
that
the
--
on
the
impression
that
mr.
greene
made
on
me
from
answering
the
questions
that
were
put
to
him,
what
would
have
been
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
asking
that
question
on
the
premise
that
you
had
written,
started
around,
namely,
that
you
can
recognized
that
you
are
not
entitled
or
you
don't
claim
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
full
due
process
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
arbitrary
if
he
--

hugo
