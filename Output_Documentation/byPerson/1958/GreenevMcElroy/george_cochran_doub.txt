i
don't

i
think
it's
just
a
routine
matters,
wearing
witnesses
probably

mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
there
is
certainly
no
statutory
authority,
and
i
know
of
no
other.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
members
of
the
court.
to
our
great
traditions
of
individual
liberty
of
the
value
of
the
human
person,
human
spirits
requiring
fundamental
fairness
in
our
normal
procedures,
to
those
principles
require
a
trial
type
due
process
hearing
when
the
government
is
determining
whether
it
will
deny
access
to
government
secrets
in
that
limited
restricted
area,
is
there
any
exception
to
their
basic
principles
and
their
application
of
due
process?
now,
a
--
a
more
precise
constitutional
test
would
be
has
the
government
limited
the
constitutional
liberties
of
the
citizen
in
this
case
to
any
greater
extent
than
is
reasonably
necessary
and
proper
under
all
the
circumstances.
now,
if
we
have,
this
procedure
is
invalid.
but
in
answer,
it
does
require,
may
i
submit,
the
most
careful
and
full
and
comprehensive
evaluation
of
the
problem
upon
a
realistic
basis
and
all
the
factors
that
are
involved
in
the
equation
not
just
one
and
you've
only
heard
one
so
far.
you
remember
you
have
said
due
process
takes
into
account
the
nature
of
the
problem
and
it
is
not
a
mechanical
instrument
or
yardstick.
now,
the
first
factor
in
the
equation
is
our
great
traditions
of
liberty
and
freedom.
now,
the
second
is
this,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
anti-fascist
committee
case,
“we
recognize
its
summary
administrative
procedure
may
be
sanctioned
by
history
or
obvious
necessity.”
now,
the
united
states
is
the
only
government
in
the
world
that
accords
any
hearing
at
all
in
connection
with
access
to
government
secrets.
now,
this
program
did
not
evolve
during
some
temporary
period
of
hysteria.
it
has
perhaps
existed
three
or
four
years
ago.
it
originated
in
the
beginning
of
1942
during
the
war.
and
it
was
operated
then
upon
a
completely
informal
basis,
as
is
being
done
in
great
britain
and
each
of
the
nato
countries,
the
defense
department
informs
me.
the
united
states
would
--
would
decide
that
it
lacked
confidence
in
someone
working
in
a
defense
plant,
and
it
would
notify
the
company
that
it
didn't
trust
such,
such,
such
and
such
a
man.
the
company
would
move
him
to
a
non-sensitive
position,
if
it
had
one,
if
it
could,
or
it
would
dismiss
him.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
report
of
the
commission
on
government's
security
states
that
2000
industrial
employees
were
dismissed
during
the
war
as
a
result
of
that
informal
procedure.
now,
then,
efforts
were
made
to
formalize
and
this
formalized
proceeding
which
was
designed
not
to
operate
on
such
an
informal
basis
but
to
accord
hearing
privileges
or
rights,
these
hearings,
limited
hearings,
they
are
limited
hearings,
of
course,
i
think,
started
in
1949.
but
in
any
event,
this
program
in
one
form
or
another
has
been
in
effect
for
17
years.
now,
there
is
a
confusion
about
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
issue
in
these
hearings.
and
i
might
say,
as
i
said
before,
that
canada,
australia,
great
britain,
france,
countries
that
had
--
know
something
about
traditions
of
freedom,
have
continued
to
operate
on
the
informal
basis.
now,
i
would
like
to
put
the
problem
in
the
terms
that
the
prime
minister
of
canada
recently
put
in.
he
said
--
he
said
to
the
parliament
this.
first,
he
said
employer
should
always
try
to
avoid
dismissals
if
it
all
possible.
they
have
a
duty
not
to
increase
the
difficulties
or
disabilities
of
persons
whose
only
misfortune
is
that
their
liability
is
open
to
question.
and
i
might
say
here
that
there
was
no
directive
to
this
employer
to
dismiss
mr.
greene.
and
i
emphasize
that
because
no
one
in
the
defense
establishment
had
any
authority
to
tell
an
employer
to
dismiss
anyone.
and
it
would
have
been
exceeding
authority
to
have
done
s.and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
regulations
and
policy
of
the
department,
defense
department
made
clear
that
it's
their
hope
that
employers
will
transfer
someone
who
isn't
cleared
for
access
to
secret
information,
a
classified
information
to
a
non-sensitive
position.on
the
other
hand,
i
must
conceive
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
we
caused
his
dismissal
in
this
way.
this
was
a
small
comparatively
small
research
corporation.
it
had
several
thousand
employees.
but
all
of
its
work,
apparently,
was
classified
navy
and
air
force
work.
if
it
had
been
general
electric,
it
perhaps
could
have
moved
him
over
to
something
else
or
general
motors.
but
here,
the
denial
of
access
to
--
to
top
secret
information,
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
was
top
secret,
he's
--
the
head
of
this
company
testified
that
he
wanted
and
needed
a
top
secret
clearance
for
this
man,
the
highest
priority
known,
the
government
secrets.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
did
not.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
because
the
statement
made
by
counsel
is
not
strictly
accurate.
what
he
said
was
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
am
reading
on
page
4
of
our
brief.what
he
said
was,
"you
are
requested
to
exclude
william
lewis
greene
from
any
part
of
your
plants,
factories
or
sites
at
which
classified
navy
projects
are
being
carried
out
and
to
bar
him
access
to
all
navy
classified
security
information."
mr.
george
cochran
doub
oh,
i
--
i
misunderstood.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
it
had
that
effect
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
your
honor,
because
it
says
from
any
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
part
of
the
plant
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
where
work
is
being
done
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
and
i
think
that
the
work
was
--
that's
--
that's
all
the
work
they
had.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
the
--
i
do
think
that
you
may
not
ignore
the
important
distinction
because
if
we
are
dealing
with
employment
outside
of
this
restricted
field
and
access
to
information,
i
think,
entirely
different
constitutional
principles
might
logically
apply.
and
--
but
i'd
like
to
continue
with
what
the
prime
minister
said,
"the
assessment
of
the
reliability
of
a
person
does
not
necessarily
or
even
usually
involve
anything
that
could
be
regarded
as
charges
against
him.
decisions
on
reliability
are
taken
everyday
in
the
public
service
and
indeed,
in
business
and
in
almost
every
sort
of
organization."
the
question
at
issue
is
not
guilt
or
innocence
of
some
particular
charge,
the
sole
question
is
whether
a
certain
person
can
or
cannot
be
entrusted
with
secret
defense
material.
it
would
give
a
completely
false
atmosphere.
and
that
false
atmosphere
has
already
been
created
here.
it
would
give
a
completely
false
atmosphere
to
the
matter
if
it
were
assumed
that
reliability
can
somehow
be
put
beyond
doubt
by
meeting
formal
charges
or
indeed
that
reliability
cannot
be
brought
into
doubt
except
on
the
basis
of
formal
charges,
assessment
of
character
maybe
the
only
consideration
in
some
instances.
that
is
not
a
matter
of
charges
or
a
trial
or
a
proof,
it
is
a
matter
of
judgment.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
he
was
address
--
the
prime
minister
st.
laurent
was
addressing
the
canadian
parliament
indicating
the
nature
of
the
issues
in
personnel
security
cases
in
canada.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
he
was
explaining
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
he
was
--
he
was
defending
their
personnel
security
program.
mr.
george

and
he
was
explaining
why
they
didn't
accord
hearing.
mr.

don't

mr.
george
cochran

i
do

what
is
valid.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
there's
not.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
there
is
not
an
expressed
statute
for
this
program.
there
--
there
are
three
or
four
statutes
from
which,
i
believe,
you
can
well
deduce.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
they
have
one
in
--
in
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
we
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
this
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
a
few
years
ago,
many
of
the
critics
of
the
government
security
programs
made
invidious
comparisons
between
our
and
the
english
and
canadian
system
pointing
out
that
their
systems
were
limited
to
sensitive
positions
in
the
government
and
sensitive
positions
in
industry.
but
you
remember
prior
to
cole
against
young,
the
government
was
applying
its
security
system
in
non-sensitive
positions.
now,
that
--
i
think
that
fact,
it's
only
about
5%
or
6%
of
the
employees
of
--
of
the
government.
and
also,
they
pointed
out
that
in
england,
transfers
are
made
wherever
possible
but
not
always
as
the
prime
minister
even
said
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
will
turn
to
that.
i
had
hope
to
go
on,
on
the
constitutional
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
could
i
--
could
i
differ
a
little
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
will.
i
--
i
will
discuss
this.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
will
discuss
this.
you'd
be
interested
in
the
--
at
the
--
in
the
appendix
of
the
report
of
the
new
york
bar
committee,
and
a
report
that's
not
always
laudatory,
in
fact,
it's
critical
of
the
security
programs
of
the
government.
[laughs]
mr.
george
cochran
doub
you'll
find
in
the
appendix
some
quotations
that
i
wish
i
had
time
to
read
confirming
the
position
the
--
the
defense
department
has
taken
and
the
government
has
taken
as
to
why
it
can't
provide
confrontation.
those
are
statements
by
the
prime
minister
of
canada
and
statements
by
the
prime
minister
of
great
britain.
now,
i
like
to
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
was
referring
to
quotations
from
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
--
it
--
as
i
recall
the
--
the
new
york
bar
committee
report,
it
recommended
a
limited
form
of
confrontation.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
i
know
the
right
commission
report
recommended
it
as
to
casual
informants,
none
suggested
it
was
a
constitutional
principle
though.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
the
question
of
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
they
thought
it
could
be
improved.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
[laughs]
well,
i
don't
say
that
it
can't
be
improved.
all
we
say
is
that's
the
matter
--
we
--
there'd
been
constant
improvements
so
far,
and
we
hope
there'll
be
more.
but
it
always
says
that's
a
matter
of
administrative
or
executive
or
legislative
power.
now,
i'm
going
to
leave
our
foreign
prime
ministers
and
go
back
to
our
own
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
authorities.
judge
wyzanski
said,
in
effect,
the
same
thing.
you
will
find
in
an
opinion
i
have
quoted,
and
justice
douglas
likewise
did
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
anti-fascist
committee
case.
and
i'd
like
to
read
you
what
he
said
because
he
recognized
so
clearly
the
distinction
that
we
are
making
here.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
didn't
involve
any
employee,
mr.
justice
black,
it
involved
the
attorney
general's
list
and
the
listing
of
the
--
of
the
anti-fascist
committee.
it
was
in
effect
whether
he
could
make
a
designation
without
any
hearing
at
all
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
which
would
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
justice
douglas
said
this.
the
problem
of
security
is
real
and
the
government
need
not
be
paralyzed
in
handling
it.
the
security
problem,
however,
relates
only
to
those
sensitive
areas
where
secrets
are
or
maybe
available.
the
department
heads
must
have
leeway
in
handling
their
personnel
problems
in
these
sensitive
areas.
the
question
is
one
of
the
fitness
or
qualifications
of
an
individual
or
a
particular
position,
one
can
be
transferred
from
those
areas,
even
when
there
is
no
more
than
a
suspicion
as
to
his
loyalty.
now,
here,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
suspicion
as
to
loyalty.
the
suggestion
of
my
friend
on
the
other
side,
what's
involved
here
is
potential
treason
is
totally
unsound
or
a
--
a
clearance
should
be
denied
to
a
blabber
mouth,
to
one
who
has
committed
no
offense.
and
this
man
was
not
charged
with
any
offense
known
to
our
law.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
--
the
--
i
have
read
this
entire
record
with
care,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
found
that
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
any
facts
at
all.
the
dispute
was
as
to
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
undisputed
facts.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
now
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
chief
justice,
this
man
had
the
most
extraordinary
number
of
associations,
not
only
with
persons
in
the
russian
embassy,
from
military
attaché,
and
not
only
with
persons
the
government
has
believed
pro-communist,
but
even
with
persons
whom
the
government
believes
had
been
actively
engaged
in
espionage.
now,
we
don't
--
we
have
never
said
that
mr.
greene
by
virtue
of
those
extensive
associations
was
not
a
good
loyal
american,
he
may
well
be
and
he
probably
is.
and
certainly,
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
he
is
not.
the
problem
--
the
problem
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
board
--
board
was,
if
you
have
a
man
over
a
long
period
of
years
with
close
associations,
with
silvermaster
who
was
publically
identified
and
testimony
before
a
committee
as
head
of
an
espionage
ring
and
documents
were
photographed
by
his
associate
ullman,
who
lived
in
his
house
in
his
basement,
mr.
greene,
strangely
enough,
had
access
to
that
basement.
he
used
to
go
down
there
and
he
saw
all
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
this
is
all
what
he
admits.
i
wouldn't
say
anything
except
what
he
admits.
and
now,
you
finding
then
in
partnership,
he
organized
a
partnership
which
does
work
for
a
short
period
of
time
for
a
company
out
in
ohio,
that
the
government
considers
controlled
and
dominated,
operated
entirely
by
communist,
he
takes
in
as
his
partner
a
man
whom
the
government
--
was
a
communist,
he
--
he
make
trips
to
nags
head
with
persons
identified
as
communist.
he
stores
his
furniture
with
someone
identified
as
a
communist.
in
other
words,
now
--
he
denies
that
he
saw
them
do
anything
improper,
he
said
he
never
saw
silvermaster
do
any
spying,
and
he
said
that
while
they
were
--
they
were
pro-russian,
pro-soviet,
he
didn't
know
that
they
were
subversives.
now,
the
problem
is,
if
the
court
please,
what
in
the
world
is
a
security
board
going
to
do
with
a
case
like
that?
now,
all
there
is
against
him
is
his
associations.
and
they
weren't
just
remote
associations,
as
counsel
on
the
other
side
suggested.
now,
obviously,
you
are
not
going
to
convict
him
of
any
crime
at
all.
but
the
--
if
the
question
is
not
one
of
doubt,
in
other
words,
is
the
defense
department
going
to
disclose
to
someone
in
that
position
the
top
secret
information
of
the
united
states?
now,
if
it
did,
and
is
the
court
to
compel
it
to
do
so
or
to
say,
"you
must
do
so
unless
you
confront
him
with
his
accuses."
well,
actually,
he
never
requested
to
confront
anybody
in
this
record,
as
long
as
the
hearings
were
going
on.
he
--
i
think
he
did
have
perhaps
after
his
clearance
was
revoked.
but
i
do
ask
you
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
the
problem.
would
it
explicable
to
the
american
people
to
say
the
defense
department
has
to
trust
those
whom
it
doesn't
trust?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
cannot
see
any
difference,
mr.
justice
black,
between
the
employees
of
the
--
of
a
contractor
and
employees
of
the
government
doing
insensitive
positions.
now,
i
think
there
is
a
different
between
employees
in
non-sensitive
positions.
i
think
if
they
are
in
non-sensitive
positions,
i'm
not
sure
the
government
is
entitled
to
the
--
to
claim
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
in
other
words,
isn't
this
fundamental
distinction
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
logically,
there's
--
there's
no
difference
for
this
reason.certainly,
the
government
is
as
much
entitled
to
exclude
private
persons
whom
it
does
not
employ
from
government
secrets
as
it
makes
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
true,
we
could
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
we
think
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
this
program
as
i
see
it,
is
this
that
in
the
case
of
sensitive
positions,
whether
in
the
government
or
outside,
the
government
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
but
in
the
case
of
non-sensitive
positions
the
ordinary
employment
by
the
state
or
by
others
then
the
employee
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
therefore
ordinary
due
process
requirements
must
be
met.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
distinction
is
a
reasonable
and
logical
one.
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
the
only
power
asserted
by
the
government
in
this
case
is
the
refusal
to
disclose
to
a
private
person
secret,
top
secret
in
this
case
military
information
and
it's
--
for
which
it's
responsible.and
that
information
is
made
available
to
private
persons
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
please,
you'll
find
the
statement
of
the
derogatory
information
was
furnished.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
it
--
it
would
your
honor.
it
would.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
in
other
words,
it
would
presuppose
that
there
may
be
in
an
individual
case
an
injustice
and
an
inequity.
but
when
you
balance
that
against
the
right
itself,
preservation
of
the
government,
the
greatest
responsibility
we
have
or
we
say
the
interests
--
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
this
restricted
area
even
though
--
even
though
in
denying
a
man
access,
it
may
have
the
consequential
effect
as
it
did
here
of
loss
of
employment.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
as
i
understood
the
solicitor
general,
we're
both
in
accord
that
no
discriminatory
policy
can
be
adopted
such
as
no
democrats
may
have
access
to
secret
information
or
republicans.
and
--
but
i
don't
believe
he
intended
to
go
further
than
that,
but
in
any
event
if
you
feel
there
must
be
the
constitution
requires
a
form
of
hearing
then
i
will
address
myself
to
the
point
that
this
limited,
restricted
hearing
under
these
circumstances
and
you
must
consider
all
the
circumstances
may
be
adequate.
but
may
i
point
that
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
he
--
he
requested
a
hearing
and
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
would
like
to
give
your
honors
these
page
references
in
the
transcript
where
he
was
--
where
the
board
told
him
that
a
witness
says
this,
what
comment
do
you
have
to
make
on
it?
and
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
i
don't
think
it
was
--
i
think
it
meant,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
did
not
give
him
a
separate
summary
of
the
information
that
they
had
in
the
file.
but
they
did
in
when
he
was
testifying,
they
did
quote
to
him
things
that
witnesses
said
and
i
would
like
to
give
you
paper
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
he
certainly
was
not
given
the
sources.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
he
--
he
was
given
the
content
of
a
great
deal
of
material
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
the
page
references
where
they
appear.
what
i
want
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
accept
it
as
--
as
it
stands,
but
the
record
does
show
that
if
any
one
is
interested
that
in
20
or
22
instances,
statements
of
--
from
what
they
had
in
their
file
were
read
to
him
or
summarized
to
him
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
power
of
--
of
acting
on
a
doubt
or
on
whether
someone
is
trustworthy
is
one
that's
freely
used
by
every
private
employer
in
the
world,
so
the
effort
here
is
not
to
subject
the
government,
that
duty
is
comparable
to
that
of
a
private
person
but
to
greater
duties
because
it
is
the
government.
now,
may
i
point
out
this.
we
would
--
i
think
we'd
have
to
agree
that
no
one
has
any
constitutional
right
to
access
to
government
secret,
no
one
has
any
legal
right.
so
then
--
then
to
find
a
constitutional
basis
we're
saying
that
mr.
green
is
entitled
to
a
constitutional
trial
type
due
process
hearing.
we
have
to
find
some
interest
that
he
has.
certainly
it's
not
the
right
of
access.
so,
you
say,
well
it's
--
it's
financial
determinant.
here,
he
consequentially
lost
his
job.
now
is
that
--
is
that
a
sufficient
interest?
certainly
it's
not
enough
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
lukens
steel
after
stating
that
no
legal
rights
were
invaded
when
the
government
refused
to
contract
with
a
private
corporation,
he
said
this,
“it
is
by
now
clear
that
neither
damage
nor
loss
of
income
in
consequence
of
the
action
of
the
government,
which
is
not
an
invasion
of
recognized
legal
rights
is
in
itself
a
source
of
legal
rights
in
the
absence
of
constitutional
legislation
recognizing
it
as
such.”
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
and
--
and
you
--
you
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
government
had
the
unrestricted
power
to
determine
with
whom
it
will
be
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
now
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
but
your
--
but
if
the
language
does
to
him
--
to
united
states,
applicable
here,
and
suppose
greene
had
been
transferred
from
a
--
this
sensitive
job
to
a
non-sensitive
job,
would
he
have
had
legal
standing
to
say
his
constitutional
rights
were
invaded?
he
would
have
had
no
financial
loss
but
if
he
wouldn't,
then
you
set
up
one
constitutional
standard
for
those
who
consequentially
lose
their
position,
not
because
although
the
government
did
the
same
thing
in
each
case,
it
denied
clearance
and
because
his
employer
doesn't
have
non-sensitive
work
for
him,
i
--
i
say
that
would
be
a
completely
illogical
conclusion.
so,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
predicated
upon
a
financial
loss.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
of
course
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
it's
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
if
the
court
please,
no
characterization
has
been
made
of
him
by
the
government
beyond
denying
him
access
to
government
secrets,
as
in
the
case
of
a
government
employee
who's
denied
access.
that's,
in
other
words,
we
go
no
further
than
we
had
to
go
in
denying
him
access.
now,
it's
true
that
these
unfortunate
consequences
have
--
have
fallen.
actually
this
administration
destroyed,
obviated
the
old
president
truman
loyalty
standard
which
did
involve
stigma
and
we
set
up
a
standard
that
we
tried
to
make
as
innocuous
as
possible
and
that
was
clearly
consistent
with
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
as
innocuous
as
possible
from
the
standpoint
of
the
individual
[laughs]
and
that
was
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security.
now
--
now
the
new
york
bar
committee
has
suggested
pretty
good
standard.
they
say
that
is
continued
employment
is
undesirable.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
certainly
not.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
of
course,
we
didn't
direct
his
employer
to
dismiss
him.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
we
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
may
i
say
this
on
stigma,
is
there
a
more
stigma
here
than
if
we
had
denied
him
a
clearance
without
a
criminal
conviction
for
accepting
a
bribe
or
for
theft
or
for
rape,
and
in
each
of
those
cases
the
courts
have
refused
to
find
the
constitutional
right
entitling
an
employee
to
be
protected
by
procedural
due
process
when
his
employer,
private
or
the
government,
dismisses
him
for
those
reasons.
actually,
this
case
seems
stronger
from
the
government's
point
of
view
because
here
you
are
dealing
with
secrets
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
there
could
be
a
difference.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
(voice
overlap)
but
in
the
case
that
i
cited
your
honor
to
you
there
was
no
conviction.
the
employee
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
his
employer
believed
he
had
committed
a
theft
or
a
rape
or
somehow
they're
dishonest.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes
at
will,
now
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
was
trying
to
consider
all
the
factors
involved
in
this
very
determination,
is
he
entitled
to
a
due
process
trial
hearing?
i
pointed
out
financial
determinant,
is
not
enough.
i
was
pointing
out
stigma,
is
not
enough.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
not
entitled
to
a
due
process
trial
type
hearing
because
if
he
is
entitled
to
it,
why,
of
course,
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
be
here.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
a
very
strong
argument
can
be
made,
that
in
these
sensitive
areas
that
we
are
talking
about
no
constitutional
rights
were
involved
at
all.
in
other
words,
as
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held,
he
has
no
constitutional
right
to
confrontation.
that
this
is
a
matter
--
this
question
of
the
government
just
determining
to
whom
it
will
admit
to
access
to
its
secrets
is
a
matter
for
the
executive
determination.
and
unless
that's
one
approach
to
it,
even
though
there
are
these
distasteful
qualities
to
the
legal
mind,
where
you
have
no
trial
type
due
process
hearing
and
they
are
distasteful.
there's
no
--
no
question
about
that.
but
in
this
restricted
area
there
should
be
no
such
requirement.
now
another
approach
is,
well
assuming,
that
--
that
that's
not
correct,
that
there
are
rights
to
work
that
are
effective
here,
why
then
we
would
--
there
would
be
the
position
while
this
restricted
type
of
proceeding
meets
the
test
of
due
process
even
though
it's
not
the
one
that
we
ordinarily
associate
--
we
like.
in
other
words,
it
is
limited,
it
is
restricted.
actually,
in
spite
of
all
our
horrors
of
baseless
informers,
i
think
the
statistics
are
--
are
very
interesting
on
the
extent
to
which
this
limited
restricted
hearing
has
worked
in
favor
of
employees
of
3400
cases,
in
a
five-year
period
before
hearing
boards,
clearance
was
restored
as
a
result
of
these
limited
hearings
in
2453
cases.
that's,
in
other
words,
over
60%.
now,
of
course,
the
answer
could
be,
well,
if
there
was
confrontation,
it
would
be
lower.
but
i
think
we
do
have
to
balance
mr.
justice
black,
this
--
these
rights
of
the
individual
against
the
other
interests
that
are
involved
here,
and
they
are
tremendous,
they
are
tremendous,
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
he
was
denied
access
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
april
1953.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
there'd
been
a
hearing
before
that
and
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
cleared
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
wrote
this
letter
saying
he'd
reviewed
those
proceedings
and
he
was
revoking
his
clearance.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
he
did.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
was
reversal,
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
then,
then
he
referred
it
to
this
another
hearing
board
when
the
employee
requested
it.
well
just
before
leaving
the
constitutional
issue
i
just
conclude
with
this.
there's
one
other
facet
here
and
that
is
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
a
holding
where
the
trial
type
hearing
with
confrontation
as
a
constitutional
prerequisite
to
a
denial
of
access
to
secret
information.
now,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
the
consequences
of
such
a
hearing
may
be
far
worse
than
the
possibilities
of
inequity
or
injustice
in
a
particular
case
under
these
regulations.
first,
it
--
it
would
mean
that
the
government,
unless
it's
prepared
to
produce
its
sources
of
information
in
a
hearing,
information
that
is
classified,
unless
it's
prepared
to
do
that,
it
then
cannot
revoke
the
clearance
or
deny
clearance
to
any
industrial
worker.
it
must
trust
those
whom
it
doesn't
trust.
it
must
accept
as
reliable
those
who
it
doesn't
consider
reliable.
the
decree
would
amount
to
a
mandamus
of
the
executive
to
disclose
publically
to
the
petitioner
one
of
two
kinds
of
information,
the
secrecy
of
which
the
executive
has
determined
to
be
required.
now,
further
more,
when
you
define
a
constitutional
principle
of
that
kind,
it
means
it's
applicable
in
time
of
war
as
well
as
in
peace.
now,
can
it
be
in
time
of
war
even,
we
must
admit
to
access
to
government
secrets,
persons
whom
we
don't
trust?
i
think
that
would
seem
inexplicable
to
the,
not
merely
the
political
branches
of
the
government,
but
to
the
people
of
the
united
states.
and
wouldn't
it
mean
that
a
constitutional
principle
had
been
defined
on
such
a
metaphysical
basis
as
even
to
endanger
the
security
of
the
united
states?
of
course,
it
would
deny
to
the
government
the
privilege
of
every
private
employer,
to
deny
the
--
to
the
executive
in
the
case
of
military
secrets
the
privilege
to
exercise
by
the
judiciary
in
determining
whom
it
will
admit
to
its
judicial
secrets.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
this
issue
can
be
resolved
merely
in
terms
of
--
no
exact
words
so
i
say,
on
personal
freedom.
there
are
too
many
other
factors
here.
now
i
like
to
return,
in
the
few
minutes
left
to
me
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
about
statutory
authority.
our
brief
argues
extensively
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
and
i
read
this
record
carefully,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i
could
not
tell
from
the
record
whether
they
were
causal,
whether
they
were
intelligence
agents
or
what
they
were.
in
other
words,
there
were
a
number
of
quotations
or
--
or
the
--
the
board
would
say
to
--
to
greene,
we
have
information
as
to
this
list.
and
in
every
case
except
one
mr.
greene
said,
yes
that's
right.
but
--
and
he
would
explain
why
he
saw
this
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
before
me
a
statement
of
attorney
general
brownell.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
think
that
it's
perhaps
debatable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
been
criticism
and
there
have
been
suggestions
made
that
an
improved
policy
would
be
to
require
casual
informants
to
be
produced.
but
my
position
is
if
there's
no
constitutional
principle
distinguishing
between
the
two,
in
other
words,
i
can
----
(voice
overlap)
how
the
--
it
may
be
the
executive
should
change
this
or
the
legislative
power.
but
i
can't
comprehend
the
definition,
or
--
or
i
just
can't
formulate
a
constitutional
principle
that
would
apply
to
one,
but
not
apply
to
the
other.
that's
my
difficulty.
now
the
--
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
it
was
stated,
i
think,
by
mr.
(inaudible)
that
only
the
chief
of
intelligence,
mr.
hoover,
had
made
the
statements
about
the
casual
informers.
attorney
general
brownell
did
make
a
comparable
statement
that
they
could
not
be
produced.
now,
on
statutory
authority,
one
statute
defines
the
congressional
policy
that
it's
illegal
for
any
person
having
defense
or
classified
information
to
disclose
the
same
to
unauthorized
persons.
now,
this
program
we
think
represents
an
attempt
to
faithfully
execute
that
law
to
define
who
are
authorized
and
who
are
unauthorized.
and
another
statute
authorizes
the
head
of
these
department
to
prescribe
regulations
for
the
custody,
use,
and
preservation
of
records,
papers
and
property
and
we
think
that
would
extend
to
the
protection
of
property
the
title
of
which
is
not
yet
under
the
united
states
such
as
guns,
aircraft
parts,
electronic
parts
being
produced
in
united
states
because
they
are
appertaining
to
the
department.
and
the
statute
use
the
word
‘appertaining.'
further,
there've
been
numerous
appropriations
by
the
congress
for
the
defense
department
upon
representations
by
the
defense
department
explaining
that
the
money
was
to
be
used
for
this
program
says
that
further,
there's
a
statute
appointing
the
right
commission
and
to
study
this
and
the
other
security
programs
and
providing
for
the
appointment
of
members
of
the
senate
and
members
of
the
house,
all
showing
a
--
a
close
acknowledgement
by
the
congress
of
the
existence
of
the
program
and
knowledge
of
the
program,
and
--
and
indeed
you'll
find
that
the
commission
itself
found
statutory
authority
which
included
members
of
the
senate
and
the
house.
and
you'll
find
a
--
a
very
good
analysis
in
its
report
of
--
of
the
statutes
involved.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
might
say
that
none
of
the
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
critics
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
our
--
our
position
as
we
outlined
it
in
our
brief
is
first,
that
this
is
an
inherent
power
of
the
executive,
but
if
the
executive
has
secrets,
inherently
it
must
protect
them
and
has
the
power
to
protect
them
and
determine
and
select
who
shall
have
access
to
them
and
as
the
solicitor
general
says
the
government's
operated
on
that
basis
for
170
years,
and,
of
course,
every
government
must
be
on
the
same
position
and
we've
developed
that.
now,
the
right
commission
takes
a
different
position.
they
feel
that
--
that
it's
a
matter
of
statutory
authority,
but
they
conclude
there
is
statutory
authority
and
they
have
a
more
extensive
discussion
of
the
statutes
than
i
think
we
have
in
our
brief.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
i
understand
there
is
a
statute
with
respect
to
oaths
and
if
--
if
we
find
there
is,
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
give
you
a
reference
to
it
later.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
that's
right
and
if
--
but
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
think
what
an
intolerable
choice
that
is
for
the
government
in
this
sensitive
area
relating
to
its
sequence.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
[laughter].
well,
we
respectfully
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
judgement
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
i
think
there
have
to
--
there
has
to
be
administrative
regularity,
i
should
think
--
i
think
even
though
there
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
still
interpret
your
decision
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right
--
that's
right.
and
i
might
say
that
i
think
there's
an
arguable
point
on
administrative
regularity
in
connection
with
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
to
act
after
this
man
had
been
cleared,
but
that
question
was
not
raised
by
counsel
on
the
other
side.
