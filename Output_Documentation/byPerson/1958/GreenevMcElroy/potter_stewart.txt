stewart
how
is
the
occasion
for
initiating
that
1951
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
had
been
cleared
in
1949.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what
was
it
that
--
that
led
to
the
revocation
of
clearance
in
1949
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
government's
own
notion?
justice
potter
stewart
there
had
been
no
request
by
his
employer
for
access
to
information
that
are
more
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
classified.
justice
potter
stewart
that
theory
and
that
position
which
you
pointed
out
is
the
government's
position
is
the
basic
ground
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
executive
power.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
was,
for
instance,
i
think
in
the
former
case,
there
was
a
one
government
witness,
wasn't
there
actually?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
taylor's
residence
in
1942
or
1943
in
buffalo,
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
when
all
is
said
and
done
now,
mr.
doub,
is
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
you
don't
rely
fundamentally
on
--
on
any
statutory
authority
if
that
is
--
that's
your
position
that
in
the
absence
of
any
such
statutes,
what
is
here
present
is
an
inherited
--
inherent
power
--.
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
executive
which
is
fundamentally
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
non
reviewable
by
the
judiciary.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
see
the
--
the
constitution
has
at
least
this
much
effect,
that
if
the
department
head,
if
the
secretary
sets
up
regulations
for
everybody,
he
has
to
abide
by
his
own
regulations
for
everybody.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
fires
--
if
he
denies
or
asks
the
employer
to
deny
confidential
--
classified
information
to
john
smith,
only
after
a
hearing
and
to
tom
jones
and
bill
green,
then
with
respect
to
richard
brown
he
has
to
have
a
hearing,
he
has
to
--
the
procedures
whatever
they
are,
i
gather
it's
your
position
that
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
need
not
be
any,
but
if
there
are
any
they
have
to
be
non-discriminatory.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
constitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
interested
in
what
you
just
said,
you
said
you
are
not
contending
here
that
the
--
all
the
procedures
that
due
process
requires
surround
a
judicial
proceeding
are
applicable
here.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
are
you
saying,
what
are
the
minimal
requirements
which
are
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
translate
that
into
what
you
think,
would
have
satisfied
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
berueffy,
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
is
it
your
contention
that
mr.
greene
was
treated
in
a
discriminatory
way,
that
is
treated
unlike
other
people
have
been
or
are
treated
under
this
program?
justice
potter
stewart
well?
justice
potter
stewart
by
--
by
a
reversal
of
the
--
of
the
(inaudible)
was
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
well,
i'm
sure
i
have
the
answer
to
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
it
is
your
point.
it
is
your
claim
here
that
--
that
there
was
discriminatory
treatment
of
this
man
as
--as
contrasted
to
other
men
under
this
program.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
further
point
then,
is
it
that
--
that
the
department
did
not
follow
its
own
regulations?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
(inaudible)if
i
should
say
is
true
and
i'm
not
familiar
yet
from
the
record,
of
course.
if
what
you
say
is
true,
wouldn't
you
then
prevail
without
going
any
further
on
the
basis
of
what
the
government's
already
conceded?
justice
potter
stewart
without
making
any
--
