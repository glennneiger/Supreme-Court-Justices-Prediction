mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
berueffy.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
this
case,
of
course,
involves
the
same
issues
in
the
main
--
on
the
merits
that
are
involved
in
taylor
against
mcelroy.
i
think
the
best
way
to
examine
what
is
at
issue
here
is
to
examine
first
what
happened.
and
if
i
may
put
this
case
in
chronological
order,
i
would
summarize
it
as
follows.
in
1936,
this
petitioner,
william
l.
greene
graduated
from
new
york
university
as
an
aeronautical
engineer,
a
profession
which
has
come
to
be
of
great
importance
in
this
country.
he
went
to
work
for
engineering
and
research
company,
a
private
corporation
and
the
history
of
his
rise
in
that
corporation
which,
although
not
a
large
one,
is
a
very
substantial
one,
is
almost
spectacular.
best
summarized
by
saying
that
at
35
years
of
age,
he
became
the
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
that
company.
and
this
could
indicate
nothing
other
than
his
devotion
to
the
duties
of
his
work
and
to
his
employer
and
to
the
government
and
to
the
military
services
because
that
company
came
to
be
engaged
almost
entirely
in
military
production.
now,
in
1942,
he
made
a
marriage
with
a
girl
to
whom
i
shall
have
occasion
to
refer,
i
think,
in
the
future,
jean
hinton
without
going
into
all
of
the
details,
could
be
said
this
was
an
unfortunate
marriage
for
many
reasons,
and
it
terminated
in
1947.
all
of
the
charges
with
no
exception
relate
in
the
government's
statement
through
the
period
beginning
in
1942
and
ending
in
1947
or
a
very
trivial
contact
continuing
over
into
1948.
now,
while
this
marriage
was
in
existence,
mr.
greene
was
one
of
the
people
selected
by
the
air
force
and
by
industry
to
go
to
germany
to
see
what
could
be
discovered
by
way
of
german
war
secrets
and
war
preparation.
he
came
back
in
1947
or
thereabouts,
about
the
time
of
the
termination
of
the
marriage
through
the
divorce.
the
navy
and
the
air
force
was
in
great
need
of
a
device
called
the
electronic
flight
simulator,
a
device
which
simulates
for
flight
conditions
for
the
purpose
of
training
pilots
in
the
handling
of
the
planes.
the
record
shows
that
at
least
two
companies
had
failed
to
produce
this
very
necessary
device.
and
so,
the
navy
came
to
erco
and
admiral
solberg,
the
chief
of
naval
research
at
the
time,
testified
that
one
of
the
things
that
brought
him
to
erco
was
the
high
caliber
of
the
engineering
staff
which
had
been
assembled
by
mr.
greene
in
that
company.
in
14
months,
mr.
greene
made
this
device.
and
this
is
the
classified
information
about
which
we
will
be
talking
exclusively
in
this
case,
that
is
the
material
that
went
into
the
making
of
the
electric
flight
simulator.
now,
in
1949,
two
years
after
the
determination
of
these
things
that
the
government
says
no,
justify
throwing
him
out
of
work,
the
government
gave
him
a
clearance
for
access
to
top
secret
information.and
two
years
later,
in
1951,
there
was
a
proceeding
to
revoke
his
clearance
for
access
to
that
information.
and
this
went
and
a
procedure
such
as
--
has
been
--
has
been
described
to
your
honors
here
occurred
before
an
organization
then
known
as
the
industrial
employment
review
board.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
there
was
so-called
derogatory
information,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
that
was
summarized
by
saying
that
he
had
known
some
communists
without
naming
them
that
he
had
seen
some
russian
diplomats
that
--
without
naming
them
and
that
he
had
gone
to
a
dinner
of
the
southern
conference
for
human
welfare.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
that's
right.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
that,
i
couldn't
say
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
--
there
was
simply
a
notice
to
erco
that
derogatory
information
had
been
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
no,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
although
greene
never
asked
for
other
than
top
secret,
the
government
had
--
other
than
secret,
the
government
had
pretty
consistently
giving
him
--
given
him
access
to
top
secret
information.
well,
this
went
to
the
board.
now,
the
government
admits
in
its
brief
that
everything
that
had
subsequently
considered
was
talked
about
in
this
hearing
before
the
industrial
employment
review
board.
i
don't
think
that's
quite
accurate
because
i
think
there
was
one
matter
which
cannot
fairly
be
said
to
appear
in
that
--
in
that
earlier
hearing
and
that
is
the
matter
of
greene's
having
worked
as
a
consultant
for
mr.
laughlin
currie,
a
one
time
presidential
assistant.
at
any
event,
this
board
examined
all
of
this
material
and
restored
greene's
clearance,
then
he
went
back
to
work
for
erco
and
the
navy
insist
--
continued
to
insist
that
erco
do
this
work
as
fast
as
possible,
and
this
was
the
situation
until
the
following
year.
and
in
april
of
1953,
and
this
was
six
years
after
anything
that
the
government
had
alleged
or
had
considered
or
that
we
ever
learned
about
as
being
direct
derogatory
information,
the
secretary
of
the
navy
wrote
a
letter
to
erco.
and
this
was
a
very
short
letter
and
what
it
says
is,
"i
have
reviewed
the
case
history
of
william
lewis
greene
and
pursuant
to
this
contract,
i
direct
you
or
i
request
you
to
exclude
him
from
your
plans
and
to
deny
him
access
to
classified
information.
and
i
think
the
phraseology
is
important
because
they
are
not,
at
this
point,
talking
about
denying
access
to
classified
information.
they
are
telling
a
private
employer
that
he
may
not
admit
his
own
employee
to
his
own
plant.
now,
this
letter
was
sent
to
erco
and
the
government
stipulates
that
they
never
sent
any
letter
to
greene
about
it.
and
the
--
the
letter
recited
no
reasons
for
a
change,
although
at
the
time
there
was
a
directive
from
mr.
wilson,
the
secretary
of
defense,
saying
that
the
secretaries
were
to
continue
to
apply
the
--
the
criteria
applied
by
the
industrial
employment
review
board.
now,
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
mr.
wells,
the
president
of
erco,
wrote
to
the
secretary
of
--
of
the
navy
and
said,
"this
man
is
very
valuable
to
us.
not
having
him
is
a
great
blow
to
the
company.
may
we
come
in
and
talk
this
over
with
you?"
and
the
answer
of
mr.
anderson
was,
"there
isn't
any
purpose
and
any
further
discussion
of
his
case."
so
greene
was
out.
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
described
what
erco
did
as
a
willing
compliance
with
the
request
of
the
government.
but
what
erco
actually
did
was
to,
as
the
record
shows,
hold
this
job
open
for
greene
for
over
a
year,
hoping
that
he
could
get
clearance.
this
is
still
in
1953.
they
wrote
greene
saying,
"please,
get
it
cleared
up.
if
there
is
anything
erco
can
do
to
help
you
by
way
of
evidence,
let
us
know."
and
mr.
berliner,
colonel
berliner,
the
chairman
of
the
board,
the
principle
stockholder
of
erco,
made
an
affidavit
that
he
would
--
there
was
no
reason
for
greene's
discharge
except
their
letter
that
they
received
from
the
secretary
of
the
navy.
he
also,
at
--
in
the
testimony
before
the
hearing
which
subsequently
occurred,
he
testified
that
he
would
stake
his
entire
company
on
mr.
greene's
judgment
as
to
the
--
his
ability
to
build
this
flight
simulator.
i
think
there
are
few
employees
who
have
received
a
more
convincing
demonstration
of
their
employer's
confidence.
after
a
great
deal
of
effort,
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
in
response
to
a
request
--
to
a
demand,
requested
the
eastern
industrial
personnel
security
board,
which
had,
by
this
time,
been
set
up
to
review
his
case.
and
at
--
this
was
in
september,
but
there
was
no
hearing
until
the
following
late
april
or
early
may.
this
is
in
1954.
during
that
intervening
time,
we
made
an
effort
to
find
out
what
this
case
was
about
and
finally,
the
board
sent
a
series
of
13
charges
which
are
in
the
record
and
which,
for
the
most
part,
relate
to
matters
concerning
jean
hinton
greene,
the
girl
to
whom
he
had
previously
been
married
and
probably
at
this
time,
he
had
been
divorced
for
seven
years.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
the
--
the
statement
of
charges
appears
in
the
printed
record
beginning
on
page
9
and
going
to
page
11
over
the
signature
of
robert
c.
sullivan.
we
were
faced
with
charges,
and
i
read
only
one
--
paragraph
(4)
on
page
10,
"many
apparently
reliable
witnesses
have
testified
that
during
the
period
of
subject's,"
that
means
mr.
greene,
"subject's
first
marriage,
his
personal
political
sympathies
were
in
general
accord
with
those
of
his
wife,"
that's
jean
hinton,
"in
that
he
was
sympathetic
towards
russia,"
and
may
i
just
comment
parenterically
that
at
the
time
to
which
this
reference
is
made,
the
russians
were
fighting
on
our
side
as
hard
as
they
could
for
their
lives
the
same
as
we
were
fighting
for
our
lives,
"followed
the
communist
party,
followed
the
communist
party
line
presented
fellow
traveler
arguments
was
apparently
influenced
by
jean's
wild
theories
egc."
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
sir.
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
exactly
what
egc
covers
in
that
paragraph.
now
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
think
jean
may
possibly
have
had
some
"wild
theories",
but
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
rationale
relation
between
a
wild
theory
and
a
finding
that
this
distinguished
engineer
is
in
the
future
going
to
be
guilty
of
treason
to
this
country.
and
that's
what
these
gentlemen
have
found.
we
do
have
an
example
of
--
of
what
jean's
wild
theories
were.
this
is
on
page
379
of
the
printed
record,
question
addressed
by
the
security
officer
of
the
board
to
dr.
marjorie
greenberg,
a
physician
who
was
mr.
greene's
--
who
is
mr.
greene's
sister.
i
would
like
to
read
this,
if
i
may.
question,
"were
there
any
beds
in
their
house
which
had
no
mattresses
on
them?"
answer,
"not
that
i
observed.
jean
slept
on
a
board
because
of
her
back."
question,
"did
you
ever
hear
her
said
that
jean
slept
on
a
board
in
order
to
keep
the
common
touch?"
answer,
"that's
a
new
one
on
me
but
everybody
i've
ever
known
who
had
any
disturbance
with
their
spinal
column
had
to
sleep
on
a
board."
now,
this
is
a
wild
idea,
no
doubt
and
if
i
were
a
mattress
[laughter]
--
if
i
were
a
mattress
manufacturer,
i
--
i
might
be
regard
this
is
subversive.
[laughter]
but
the
point
is,
is
this
material
to
defend
--
to
deprive
the
government
and
the
military
of
the
services
of
a
man
who
have
--
who
has
served
it
well,
extremely
well,
testified
to
not
by
greene
and
his
friends,
but
throughout
this
record
to
--
by
military
officials
concerned
with
the
problem
of
getting
this
material.
now,
coming
to
the
issues,
as
i
see
them
in
this
case,
we
are
first
met
with
the
problem
of
what
is
it
the
government
did?
the
government
says,
"we
merely
denied
this
man
access,
and
any
damage
was
consequential."
but
in
their
brief,
they
admit
in
the
face
of
what
they
cannot
practically
deny
that
to
a
man
in
the
profession
of
aeronautical
engineering,
the
denial
of
clearance
is
--
is
the
equivalent
practically
of
denying
him
a
right
to
work
at
his
profession
because
there
is
no
significant
aircraft
manufacturer
who
can
employ
an
aeronautical
engineer
who
does
not
have
clearance.
it's
simply
can't
be
done.
the
government
admits
this.
but
they
say,
"we
have
control
of
the
classified
information
of
the
government
--
that
belongs
to
the
government."
but
the
government
does
not
limit
its
claim
of
employment
to
the
control
of
classified
information
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
you
cannot
be
an
officer
of
a
corporation
without
clearance.
and
as
the
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
erco,
greene
was,
of
course,
a
corporation
officer.
and
there
are,
i
suggest,
many
officers
of
a
corporation
who
do
not
need
access
to
classified
information.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
said
yesterday,
this
isn't
--
in
any
case,
this
is
not
free
access
to
all
the
secrets
of
the
government.
this
is
access
to
that
information
which
you
need
to
perform
your
duties
on
the
contracts
that
your
employer
is
doing
for
the
government.
that's
all
it
is.
you
could
have
access
to
top
secret
or
super
top
secret
or
any
other
classification,
but
if
you
didn't
require
that
information
in
your
job,
you
couldn't
get
it.
so,
the
government
is
controlling
or
attempting
to
control
the
officers
of
corporations.
furthermore,
and
this
case
demonstrates,
the
government
is
not
limiting
its
control
to
ownership
--
to
--
to
material
of
which
it
really
has
ownership
because
the
executive
order
which
is
put
--
which
is
stated
in
--
in
its
text
in
--
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
says
that
whether
or
not
you
produce
this
--
this
information,
if
the
government
classified
it,
you
may
not
have
access
without
clearance,
that
is
it's
subject
to
control
under
that
executive
order.
so,
here,
you
get
some
information
that
the
government
had,
but
it
isn't
valuable.
it
is
invaluable
until
a
man,
like
greene,
makes
the
engineering
flow
that
turns
it
into
something
that's
useful,
and
it
isn't
valuable
i
suggest
until
a
man,
like
taylor
turns
it
out
on
the
lays
in
a
--
in
the
form
of
a
useful
thing
and
this
is
what
the
government
is
controlling.
now,
this
is
what
the
government
says.
they
--
they
have
a
right
to
control
and
let
me
suggest,
if
i
may,
that
the
way
the
secretary
of
the
navy
handled
this
case
indicates
exactly
what
the
government
does
claim
and
what
the
government
repeats
in
its
brief,
i
suggest,
in
this
court
which
is
that
this
is
an
absolute
power,
that
it
is
unrestrained,
that
nobody
can
question
and
because
those
are
relatively
strong
statements,
i
--
i
think
i
should
read
from
page
43
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
greene
case.
down
towards
the
bottom,
"that
the
executive
may
ultimately
act
in
this
area
on
mere
doubts
or
simply
a
lack
of
complete
confidence."
and
on
page
44,
"action
which
may,
if
necessary,
be
based
on
no
more
than
doubt
and
which
is,
in
itself,
not
judicially
reviewable."
and
then
finally
quoting
with
a
probo
from
von
knorr
against
miles,
"the
government
would
remain
free
to
disregard
the
testimony
and
rely
on
its
uncorroborated
suspicions
and
its
uncorroborated
suspicions,"
as
the
government
says
elsewhere
in
its
brief,
"may
be
fully
consistent
with
the
likelihood
that
this
man
is
in
fact
both
loyal
and
discreet."
now,
this,
i'm
--
i
would
like
to
say
as
a
slanting
reply
to
what
mr.
--
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
this
is
a
claim
of
absolute
authority,
of
unlimited
authority.
and
it
is
in
square
conflict,
i
submit,
with
the
statement
of
this
court
in
--
in
wieman
against
updegraff
that
you
cannot
exclude
even
from
the
exercise
of
what
used
to
be
denominated
a
privilege
on
the
basis
--
on
a
basis
which
is
patently
arbitrary
or
discriminatory.
and
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
government
officials
may
not
act
in
an
arbitrary
fashion,
may
not
draw
irrational
or
dogmatic
inferences
from
facts.
now,
i
think,
unless
you
are
going
to
be
--
to
accept
what
is
a
clear
transparency,
the
government
is
claiming
to
exercise
an
unlimited
control
over
the
employment
and
the
livelihood
and
the
very
lives
of
what
is
today
approximately
3
million
employees
in
private
industry.
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
impossible
to
determine
this
kind
of
a
case
without
facing
the
realities.
and
the
reality
is
that
this
is
an
exercise
of
control
on
an
unrestrained
and
unlimited
basis.
now,
first
question
that
comes
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
think
so,
yes.
i
--
i
have
had
some
difficulty
knowing
exactly
what
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
said,
but
they
did,
in
effect,
say,
"well,
this
is
a
matter
of
politics
of
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
executive
power.
they
did
make
a
reference
to
inherent
power
of
the
executive.
that
is
the
theory
that
was
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
brings
us,
i
think,
to
the
question
of
--
of
where
does
this
power
come
from?
in
a
government
where
we've
got
a
due
process
clause,
the
very
essence
of
which
is
protection
against
arbitrary
governmental
action
as
this
court
said
in
slochower.
what
is
this
kind
of
a
power
that's
unlimited
control?
where
does
it
come
from?
government
says
it
comes
from
an
inherent
executive
power,
an
inherent
executive
power
which
the
--
the
--
which
the
executive
had
always
had.
now,
i
think
there
might
be
an
--
i
think
there
might
be
an
inherent
power
to
do
some
things,
but
i
think
you
have
to
go
a
long
way
to
spell
out
an
executive
--
an
inherent
executive
power
thus
to
interfere
what
the
private
employment
and
private
livelihood
of
a
citizen
of
the
government.
and
i
don't
think
we
need
to
be
concerned
about,
although
i
--
i'm
sure
that
greene's
right
to
private
employment
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
which
i
cannot
believe
to
be
less
important
than
the
right
to
travel
or
--
or
any
of
the
things
that
this
court
has
given
protection
for.
but
even
if
the
--
what
the
government
was
--
says
is
true,
that
this
is
only
an
exercise
of
the
privilege,
the
--
the
government
can
give
or
take
as
it
chooses.
i
think
what
wieman,
what
--
what
slochower
and
what
--
and
what
these
other
cases
have
said
is
that
even
so
the
government
can't
do
this
on
an
arbitrary
basis.
now,
yesterday,
the
--
the
solicitor
general
conceded,
i
thought,
that
you
couldn't
do
it
on
the
arbitrary
basis
of
--
of
taking
one
out
of
every
three.
now,
since
--
since
we
are
in
the
process
of
defining
future
conduct,
and
that
is
what
we
are
doing
realistically,
greene
never
did
anything
and
there
isn't
anything
in
these
charges.
greene
never
did
anything
illegal,
immoral
or
indiscreet,
and
i
should
say
making
a
bad
marriage
is
indiscreet.
and
the
record
shows
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
is
it
an
indiscretion
that
--
that
warrants
an
inference
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
it's
--
it's
ill
luck,
it's
indiscreet,
it's
a
thing
that's
happened
to
a
great
many
people.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
we
would
--
we
would
say
that
they
constitute
the
bulk.
and
may
i
call
your
attention,
justice
whitaker,
to
the
--
to
the
appendix
b
to
our
brief
in
which
i
have
tried
to
set
up
the
categories
in
which
i
think
these
charges
fall.
one,
there
were
contacts
with
the
soviet
embassy.
these
were
business
contacts.erco
had
sold
a
great
deal
of
material
to
the
russians
prior
to
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
you
mean
the
russian
diplomat?
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
sir,
no
doubt
about
that.
then
four
of
them
were
people
that
greene
had
met
in
the
course
of
this
business
of
attempting
to
sell
the
worked
propeller.
one
of
them,
the
fact
is
he
never
met
and
the
record
pretty
well
bears
out
the
fact
that
--
that
this
(inaudible)
was
gone
out
of
the
country
before
greene
ever
tried
to
sell
the
propeller.
now,
this
--
of
course,
i'm
not
asking
the
--
the
court
to
--
to
review
this
record
and
make
fact
findings,
but
i
am
saying
that
the
solicitor
general
has
said
--
conceded,
i
think,
that
we
must
have
some
kind
of
a
rational
basis.
i
think
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
he
indicated
that
he
didn't
think
this
could
be
completely
arbitrary,
although
that's
the
way
the
--
the
secretary
maybe
acted,
as
i
pointed
out.
now,
as
i
say,
you
are
trying
to
define
or
to
divine
some
things
which
were
not
illegal,
which
were
not
immoral,
which
in
the
case
of
trying
to
sell
goods
to
the
russians
in
the
early
1940s
was
not
even
unusual.
you're
trying
to
--
to
divine
a
future
conduct
which
can't
be
equated
to
anything
expect
the
possibility
that
this
man
will
commit
treason
against
the
government.
this
is
the
real
need,
and
i
--
i
think
this
is
the
way
it's
got
to
be
faced.
now,
solicitor
general
said
you
couldn't
do
it
by
picking
every
third
man.
this,
he
thinks,
would
be
arbitrary.
i
suggest
that
there
are
other
procedures
of
divination
which
people
in
the
past
have
used
that
--
for
instance,
lot
casting
or
say
putting
all
the
names
in
the
hat
and
pulling
out
10
or
1000.
others
have
--
have
tried
to
divine
the
future
by
looking
at
the
entrails
of
a
freshly
slain
animal.
but
even
in
the
days
of
the
romans,
they
didn't
try
to
define
future
on
the
basis
of
information
from
anonymous
hidden
formats.
and
this
is
what
this
government
is
trying
to
do.
now,
if
there
has
to
be
some
process,
i
submit,
it
has
to
be
due
process.
it
has
to
comport
with
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause.
in
taylor,
mr.
rauh
talked
about
the
problem
of
confrontation.
the
problem
of
due
process
in
greene
is
much
broader
than
confrontation
because,
as
i
understand
it,
any
kind
of
a
process
would
require
some
kind
of
notice,
some
kind
of
hearing,
some
kind
of
effective
opportunity
to
defendants
or
one's
self.
in
this
case,
the
government
stipulated
that
we
didn't
have
notice.
they
stipulate
that
--
that
we
were
not
informed.
and
i
would
like
to
read
that
particular
paragraph
to
you.
that
stipulation
of
facts
begins
on
page
27
of
the
printed
record,
and
the
particular
paragraph
is
on
page
30,
paragraph
(23).
in
making
its
decision,
the
eastern
industrial
personnel
security
board
took
into
consideration
the
whole
file
of
the
case
which
includes
information,
neither
the
content
nor
source
of
which
has
been
revealed
to
the
plaintiff.
so,
admittedly
don't
get
notice,
we
admittedly
do
get
what
this
court
says
in
de
jonge
against
oregon
that
we
couldn't
get
by
way
of
treatment,
namely,
we
may
very
well
have
been
convicted
on
a
charge,
that
we
never
know
anything
about.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
sir.
may
i
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
that's
paragraph
(14)
on
page
29.
prior
to
the
letter
of
april
17th,
1953
referred
to
in
paragraph
(13),
no
communication
of
any
kind
relating
to
the
action
of
robert
b.
anderson
was
sent
to
the
plaintiff
and
his
employer
and
except
as
herein
set
forth,
there
was
no
direct
communication
between
the
department
of
defense
and
the
plaintiff.
and
then,
i
might
say
that
we
set
forth
as
part
of
the
stipulation,
every
piece
of
correspondence
between
the
--
the
department
and
greene
or
myself,
including
my
brother,
who
saw
the
final
letter
to
the
board.
so
that
it
was
stipulated
that
we
got
no
--
no
notice
before
anderson's
action.
and,
of
course,
we
did
get
the
statement
of
charges.
and
this
is
all
that
we
ever
got.
now,
i
understood,
with
some
surprise
that
mr.
rauh
in
the
taylor
case
was
supplied
with
synopsis
of
what
the
informant
said.
but
we
got
no
such
treatment
as
that.
and
when
i
asked
if
it
wouldn't
be
well
in
--
in
view
of
the
complexities,
if
i
went
to
new
york
and
headed
something
in
the
nature
of
a
pre-trial
about
what
the
fact
issues
work,
there
was
no
response.
we
got
to
the
letter
but
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
a
pre-trial
conference,
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
it
is.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
sir,
that
appears
on
page
2
and
3
in
the
record
as
part
--
as
part
of
paragraph
(5)
of
the
original
complaint.
this
is
the
undated
letter
which,
if
you'll
indulge
me
just
a
moment
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
there
is
a
letter
in
which
i've
said
recited
the
earlier
charges
and
said
these
aren't
--
these
aren't
sufficient,
may
i
come
to
new
york
and
let's
have
a
pre-trial
conference
this
evening,
what's
really
in
issue
here,
no
answer.
all
we
got,
all
we
ever
had
to
--
to
go
on
was
this
summary
of
13
alleged
charges.
some
of
which
were
not
true,
some
of
which
were
obviously
couldn't
be
true,
none
of
which
was
ever
admitted
by
greene
despite
the
government's
contention
to
the
contrary
in
its
brief.
now,
it
is
true
that
we
didn't
deny
such
facts
as
that
--
that
greene
had
married
jean
hinton
greene.
we
did
--
we
did
deny
that
she
was
a
communist.
and
we
did
bring
two
witnesses.
the
best
we
could
do
is
say
that,
"i
didn't
know
that
--
that
she
was
a
communist.
we
couldn't,
of
course,
get
jean
herself
because
we
have
no
subpoena
power.
never
mind."
so
we
tried.
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
no,
sir.
nobody
has
subpoena
power.
you
get
witnesses,
sir,
only
if
they
are
willing
voluntarily
to
--
to
come
and
at
your
own
expense.
and
the
hearing,
of
course,
is
held
in
new
york
and
if
you
have
many
witnesses,
it
gets
to
be
a
problem
too.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
no
provision
for
hung
witnesses,
none.
the
government
--
the
board
does
permit
you
to
submit
affidavits
which
are
--
if
you
can't
get
a
witness
but,
of
course,
it's
a
practical
matter.
you've
got
to
defend
these
things.
you
--
you
want
your
witnesses
there.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
the
witnesses
for
the
respondents
are
sworn
and
cross-examined
by
the
security
officer.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
suppose
that's
on
general
statute.
and
--
and
actually,
the
reference,
of
course,
is
not
to
the
perjury
statute
but
to
the
false
statement
statute
to
the
government.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
you
--
you
never
see
any
witnesses
for
the
government,
mr.
justice
brennan.
you
don't
know
whether
there
are
any
or
not.
in
our
case
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
no,
in
neither
case
was
there
a
government
witness.
the
--
in
both
cases,
the
--
the
government's
case
consisted
of
reading
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
oh,
in
--
in
taylor
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
in
taylor
did
offer
to
produce
a
witness,
yes
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
--
as
to
residence
but
they
didn't
produce
any
witnesses
in
our
case.
so
that
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
unfairness.
as
you
know,
every
witness
is
difficult
and
--
and
worries
on
cross-examination.
but
if
the
government's
witnesses
aren't
subjected
to
this,
of
course,
their
frailties
never
show
up,
whereas
the
employee's
witnesses
are
--
suffer
the
frailties
that
in
a
normal
judicial
trial
would
--
would
not
be
important
because
one
offsets
the
other.
but
you've
a
got
a
perfect
--
you've
a
got
a
perfect
presentation
for
the
government
which
nobody
can
attack
and
you
have
to
deal
with
the
frailties
of
your
own
witnesses.
now,
mr.
rauh,
i
think,
has
covered
confrontation.
i
would
like
to
say
only
this,
that
as
i
understand
cross-examination,
its
purpose
need
not
be
limited
to
showing
that
the
witness
is
a
perjurer.
i,
personally,
would
have
liked
to
cross-examine
the
informant
on
paragraph
simply
because
it
is
a
matter
of
academic
curiosity.
i
would
have
liked
to
known
whether
he
and
i
had
the
same
idea
of
what
a
wild
idea
is.
i
--
i
think
this
is
important.
if
you
are
going
to
--
to
try
to
base
a
decision
on
this
kind
of
material,
then
the
process
isn't
fair.
it
doesn't
even
approach
fairness,
unless
you
--
you
have
some
ability
to
--
to
be
sure
you
are
talking
about
the
same
things.
and
you
can't
do
this
without
cross-examination,
not
when
they
use
terms
like
this,
not
when
it's
--
in
the
little
citation
in
our
brief,
a
hearing
officer
says
to
you,
"well,
now,
if
you
are
talking
about
liberals,
that's
a
play
on
word.
isn't
that
the
same
thing
as
communism
and
liking
russia?"
that
citation
has
--
that
quote
is
in
our
brief.
it
may
not
be,
i
submit.
there
could
be
a
liberal
but
wasn't
a
communist.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
i
think
[laughter]
that
is
arguable.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
first
you
asked
me
a
question
and
i
couldn't
find
the
--
the
precise
citation.
my
letter
to
the
board,
in
which
i
asked
for
a
pretrial
conference
and
which
i
asked
for
great
deal
of
information
begins
on
page
178
of
the
printed
record
and
extends
to
page
181
of
the
printed
record.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
devote
my
time
to
two
basic
propositions.
first,
mr.
doub,
is
i
think
not
observing
a
very
basic
difference.
it
seems
to
me
that
colonel
berliner
as
the
head
of
erco
could
have
fired
greene
on
any
ground
that
he
wished
to
fire
greene
on,
good,
bad
or
indifferent.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
to
a
government
employee
subject
to
limitations
that
we
all
know,
that
same
power
would
exist.
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
however,
is
a
perfectly
satisfactory
relation
between
an
employer
and
his
employee
and
a
third
person,
albeit,
the
government,
coming
in
and
interfering
with
that
employment
and
this
is
what
i
think,
truax
against
raich,
said
was
protected
against
constitutional
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
the
government
purported
to
make
that
contract
with
the
company.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
i
think
in
general,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
might
be
considered
and
that
--
that
brings
us
to
our
problem
of
--
of
what
the
solicitor
general
said
yesterday
as
i
see
it,
which
is
as
a
practical
matter,
the
government
has
to
deal
with
--
with
private
businesses
now,
if
it
wants
to
get
these
things
done.
now,
where
does
the
authority
for
this
kind
of
a
contractual
provision,
which
in
reality
and
which
in
effect
gives
the
government
control
over
the
employees
of
--
the
people
who
are
employed
by
private
business?
where
does
that
come
from?
well,
the
thing
that
seems
to
me
most
important
is,
that
one
might
concede
that
the
government
could
exercise
such
an
authority
to
him
and
could
by
some
fair
procedure
exclude
those
persons
as
to
whom
it
is
has
a
doubt.
i
concede
this
for
the
purpose
of
argument
only,
but
still
i
don't
think
that
it
is
possible,
inherently,
in
the
american
system
of
constitutional
government,
to
have
any
government
official
with
an
absolutely
arbitrary
power
to
do
this
kind
of
thing.
i
think
we
are
now
talking
in
--
in
very
real
terms
of
too
much
power
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
first
proposition
is
this.
let's
assume
that
on
the
basis
of
these
things,
if
in
context,
these
things
that
are
said
about
greene,
if
in
context
one
might
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
wise
to
permit
access
or
not,
still
it
would
have
to
be
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
it
can't
be
a
reasonable
doubt
unless
there's
been
something
approximating
a
fair
procedure.
now,
i
am
not
necessarily
talking
about
a
judicial
trial
or
anything
like
that,
but
there
has
to
be
a
fair
procedure
for
determining
what
the
facts
are
and
how
they
fit
into
the
context.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
think
this
is
absolutely
correct.
i
think
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
think
--
it
think
the
minimum
requirement
if
i
may
say
so,
is
some
kind
of
a
procedure
which
looked
at
overall
results
in
some
confidence
that
this
is
a
fair
result
and
that
it
has
been
fairly
arrived
at.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
all
right.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
of
course
our
position
is
that
we
didn't
get
anything
and
therefore
anything
we
asked
for,
that
we're
entitled
to
gives
us
a
right
to
the
judgment
here.
i
think
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
a
fair
notice,
which
tells
you
what
the
real
facts
are,
what
the
real
facts
upon
which
the
government
proposes
to
act
by
depriving
you
of
your
employment.
this
you
must
have.
this
is
--
this
is
an
absolute
requirement
of
--
of
anything
to
be
described
as
a
pair
process.
this
by
stipulation,
i
might
say,
signed
by
the
assistant
attorney
general,
we
did
not
get.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
we
didn't
get
it
even
then,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
stipulation
that
--
that
they
have
never
told
us,
either
the
source
or
the
(inaudible)
of
all
these
things
that
they
brought
against
him.
now,
i
think
if
the
secretary
of
--
of
the
navy
is
a
reasonable
person,
i
think
he
did
not
deny
mr.
greene
clearance
because
mrs.
greene,
the
former
mrs.
greene
thought
that
sleeping
on
bed
boards
kept
the
common
touch.
so,
we
don't
know
what
it
is
that
this
decision
was
based
on.
all
we
know
is
by
stipulation
there
was
something
we
didn't
know
about.
now,
the
second
thing
is
i
don't
think
you
have
to
have
a
jury
trial
and
i
don't
think
you
have
to
use
the
formal
rules
of
evidence,
but
you
do
have
to
arrive
at
facts
on
some
kind
of
a
rational,
factual
basis.
and
it
isn't
fair
and
it
isn't
correct
to
say,
that
because
greene
said
that
he
knew
silvermaster
who
incidentally
was
mrs.
the
former
mrs.
greene's
superior
in
the
department
of
agriculture
and
that
i
am
comprehensible
that
he
wouldn't
have
had
some
contact
with
his
--
with
his
wife's
superior.
that
isn't
the
equivalent
of
saying
that
greene
knew
that
silvermaster
back
in
these
years,
15
years
ago,
that
silvermaster
was
a
spy,
if
he
was
a
spy.
and
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
on
this
point
to
what
i
consider,
possibly,
the
most
salient
thing
in
this
entire
record,
at
the
bottom
of
page
425.
greene
was
going
to
--
was
being
asked
about
his
knowledge
of
these
people
and
he
said,
“i
had
no
indication
that
they
were
communists,
and
when
i
was
interviewed
by
the
fbi,
i
said
that”,
and
the
fbi
man,
one
of
the
fbi
men
said,
“that's
right,
they
didn't
go
around
carrying
signs
that
they
were
communists
because
they
were
all
working
for
the
government.”
now,
i
think
if
you're
going
to
say
that
the
government
has
a
doubt
about
silvermaster,
and
therefore,
we're
going
to
have
a
doubt
about
greene,
that
we
need
in
some
kind
of
a
factual
situation
to
determine
the
--
the
things
that
give
significance
and
lend
content
and
then
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
--
it
was
an
unfair
or
unreasonable
request
to
say
that
we
ought
to
know
what
the
government
did
decide.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well
if
i
may
refer
to
an
earlier
illustration,
if
this
is
not
an
arbitrary
decision.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
but
i
am
entitled,
or
greene
is
entitled
it
seems
to
me,
basically
and
fundamentally
to
a
restriction
that
the
secretary
must
not
make
an
arbitrary
decision.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
it
certainly
was
decided
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
--
merely
on
my
impression,
i
would
like
to
make
this
illustration
if
i
might,
going
to
back
to
my
earlier
one.
if
you
were
going
to
predict
future
disloyalty
or
whatever
it
is
that
you
are
predicting
here,
it
might
be
better
if
you
do
it
by
--
by
looking
at
the
intros
or
by
sticking
the
--
the
nine-tenths
of
the
--
to
the
volume
of
purging,
because
at
least
you
could
say
we're
relying
on
divine
providence
and
not
upon
a
fallible
man.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
if
i
--
i
just
can't
see
that
that's
not
taking
and
making
a
prediction
because
you're
not
going
to
take
a
chance
that
involves
taking
or
making
a
prediction.
the
past
has
been
greene.
the
past
as
the
record
shows
is
that
he
was
reliable,
that
he
did
do
--
did
make
--
pay
attention
to
security
rules.
that
he
did
have
the
confidence
and
respect
of
the
people
that
knew
him.
now,
you
are
saying
an
--
a
stranger,
a
total
stranger
can
--
can
say,
well
i
just
have
an
impression
that
i
don't
want
to
take
this
man
and
i
think,
and
i
should
point
out
here,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
result
might
ultimately
turn
out
the
same,
in
a
due
process
hearing
doesn't
excuse
the
absence
of
procedural
due
process
as
this
court
held
in
coe
against
armour
fertilizer.
i
--
i
think
at
this
point
that
--
that
this
i
couldn't
say
was
a
fair
procedure.
i
--
i
think
any
government
decision
has
to
be
made
on
facts
and
when
you
are
making
an
individual
adjudicatory
finding
of
fact,
it
has
to
be
on
something
more
than
just
an
impression
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
that
is
correct,
but
never
has
this
court
insofar
as
i
know,
given
the
president
a
power
to
make
a
completely
arbitrary
decision.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
certainly,
there
are
certain
legislative
and
general
things
that
the
president
does
on
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
--
i
have
no
intention.
i
--
i
think
that
any
decision
in
this
case
that
isn't
--
isn't
based
on
putting
these
facts
in
context,
with
some
kind
of
a
record
we
can
look
at
is
--
is
necessarily
in
and
on
its
face,
arbitrary.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
that
is
true.
but
i
don't
think
that
anybody's
ever
been
thrown
out
of
a
job
without
some
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
certainly
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
certainly,
but
those
are
subordinate
to
the
president.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
those
are
subordinate
to
the
president,
not
somebody
else
as
employed.
just
one
thing
that
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
and
that
is,
it's
beyond
this
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
basic
to
my
position
is
the
fact
that
if
--
if
you're
going
to
discharge
a
man
there
has
to
be
some
reasonable
relations
between
something
that's
a
legitimate
ends
of
government
and
what
it
is
that
he
--
he
is
supposed
to
have
done.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
legitimate
end
of
government,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
to
take
a
man
of
doubtful
loyalty,
but
i
think
that
off
of
the
job,
but
i
think
that
before,
i
want
the
secretary
of
navy
or
anyone
else,
designating
any
citizen
of
this
country,
as
a
doubtful
--
person
a
doubtful
loyalty,
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
between
what
it
is
that
he's
supposed
to
have
done
and
the
problem
of
doubtful
loyalty.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
certainly.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
don't
think
we
need
a
judicial
hearing.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
--
i
think
on
confrontation,
that
clearly
you
cannot
put
allegations
in
congress
without
knowing
the
identity
of
the
witness
and
his
opportunities
for
observation,
his
motivation,
as
well
as
just
the
--
the
essence
of
what
he
has
said.
now,
i
would
say
that
we're
getting
into
--
in
(inaudible)
case,
we
got
into
this
problem
of
confidential
and
casual
importance.
i
think
the
answer
to
this
is,
that
the
judgment
ought
to
be
drawn
on
a
record,
uncomplicated
by
facts
that
are
known
only
through
the
trier
of
facts
and
i
think
the
government's
plea
of
necessity
here
is
a
specious
one.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
in
an
administrative
hearing,
you
don't
apply
to
technical
rules
of
evidence,
you
can
admit
hearsay.
but
you
can't
make
a
decision
resting
wholly
on
hearsay.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well,
that
he
was
so
treated,
i
think
that's
not
subject
to
doubt.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
because
he
didn't
get
any
kind
of
a
hearing.
the
hearing
he
got
resulted
in
a
clearance.
then
he
was
arbitrarily
thrown
out
of
work,
for
--
for
a
year.
actually,
before
he
ever
got
a
hearing
--
hearing
was
the
following
the
act.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
this
wasn't
a
reversal
of
the
hearing
board,
mr.
justice
potter,
and
all
i
can
say
at
this
point
is
--
is
please
just
read
the
letter
on
page
two
of
the
record
to
see
whether
it
was
or
it
wasn't.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
well
then
if
i
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
that's
right,
he
didn't
get
any
promise
--
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
or
in
--
clearly
--
it's
clear
they
didn't
follow
their
own
regulations,
because
the
secretary
of
the
navy
was
instructed
to
apply
the
standards
for
interim
clearances,
which
had
been
applied
by
the
board.
but
he
wasn't
instructed
to
review
and
he
did
not
review.
he
didn't
say
i
reviewed
these
findings.
he
said
i
reviewed
the
--
the
case
history
file
and
concluded
that
his
access
is
inconsistent.
i
mean,
he
just
completely
ignored
the
previous
favorable
finding
of
the
board.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
think
so.
mr.
carl
w.
berueffy
i
mean
i
--
i
--
i've
argued
the
constitutional
questions,
but
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
need
not
reach
them.
