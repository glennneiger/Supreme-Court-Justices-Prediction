isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
make
that
part
of
occasion.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
ill
luck,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
government
subpoena
power
in
--
in
these
cases?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
witness
has
sworn
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
policy
of
administrative
note,
a
special
authorization
or
just
a
general
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you're
a
(inaudible)
have
you
filed,
mr.
doub
--
mr.
doub?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
the
canadian
system
like
in
england?
and
isn't
this
the
internal
executive
scheme
both
in
england
and
in
canada,
more
particularly
in
england,
who
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
not
to
be
trusted
or
--
or
not
--
about
whom
questions
are
raised
to
a
government
employee
and
they
have
a
government,
i
think,
they're
familiar
with
england,
they
have
a
government,
takes
very
careful
measures
within
its
full
rights
of
discharging
anybody
not
to
do
any
damage.
the
difficulty
is
that
--
that
--
in
the
first
place,
this
isn't
the
question
of
dismissing
some
government
employee
for
a
good
reason
or
bad
reason
or
no
reason
in
the
absence
of
limitation
upon
such
dismissal
by
a
civil
service
act.
in
the
second
place,
he
must
do
--
the
situation
of
the
civil
service
act
may
not
or
does
not
imply,
the
government
may
limit
its
powers,
its
constitutional
powers
by
wrecking
a
system
of
administrative
procedure
and
then
the
question
is,
as
it
is
here,
whether
the
system
of
administrative
procedure
grants
certain
safeguards
though
pursued
constitutional
may
not
require
such
safeguards
to
re-grant
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
a
very
different
system
from
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
under
which
both
england
and
--
and
canada
and,
i
believe,
australia
are
operating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there,
it's
entirely
within
the
government
without
any
statute
setting
up
this
system
wholly
apart
from
the
fact
that
in
none
of
those
three
nations
that
i
have
named
that
they
got
a
due
process
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
doub,
i
assume
this
is
--
is
also
an
either
or
--
or
--
either
or
proposition,
namely,
the
government
has
confidential
information.
it
therefore,
may
withhold
it
and
therefore
it
may
generate
a
process
by
which
a
man
loses
his
job,
is
that
right?
i
suggest
the
third
alternative,
if
they
have
confidential
information
and
if
they
hold
on
to
it,
and
forgo
therefore
the
right
to
have
this
individual
(inaudible)
if
it
doesn't
want
to
disclose
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
do
that
in
connection
with
criminal
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
what
being
in
high
office
we
learn
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
be
as
skewed
as
that
in
your
statement?
in
the
first
place
when
you
say
adjudicatory
you
are
already
bringing
a
lot
of
preference.
in
the
second
place
the
president
of
united
states
very
often
makes
that
this
court
had
failed,
very
important
determinations
presumably
on
facts
which
we
couldn't
possibly
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
make
it
in
--
in
raising
or
lowering
the
tariff
and
he
may
make
it
in
denying
a
--
an
international
flying
certificate
or
whatever
it's
called.
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely
suggesting
it's
not
necessary
to
be
extreme
in
order
to
be
--
to
present
the
problem
in
this
case,
the
issues
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
president
had
fired
members
of
the
cabinet
and
law
officials
all
the
time
arbitrarily
because
they
didn't
like
him
or
they
didn't
go
along
with
him
or
they
didn't
--
what
not
or
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
always
because
that
all
is
a
(inaudible)
or
--
or
also
a
lady
was
involved
in
the
center
of
a
controversy
regarding
what
the
political
decisions
by
by
a
person.
