william
l.
greene,
petitioner,
versus
neil
mcelroy
et
al.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
berueffy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
berueffy,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it
was
stipulated
that
they
--
that
the
petitioner
obtained
no
kind
of
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doub.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doub,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
the
letter
directed
the
--
the
employer
to
let
him
from
having
access
to
the
plant
where
he
worked
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
he
was
--
where
he
was
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
executive
officer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i'm
--
i
was
just
directing
my
question
to
your
statement
that
you
did
not
ask
the
company
to
discharge
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
merely
told
him
that
he
shouldn't
have
access.
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
understood
counsel,
the
--
the
letter
of
the
secretary
directed
them
not
to
permit
him
in
the
plant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
--
if
a
man
can't
get
in
the
plant
that
he
is
the
executive
officer
of,
how
can
you
say
that
he
didn't
--
that
the
secretary
didn't
direct
him
to
discharge
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
way
i
understood
counsel
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
the
way
i
thought
they
had
said
it
to
you.
and
you
said
that
--
that
the
--
the
whole
thing
was
researched
and
therefore,
he
couldn't
be
in
the
plant
at
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
under
the
government
order.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
understood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
text
of
the
--
text
of
the
report
confirmed
that
as
the
opinion
of
the
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
you
were
but
--
but
how
about
the
report
of
the
committee
itself?
did
it
--
did
it
follow
those
citations
and
suggest
that
confrontation
was
not
necessary
or
did
it
arrive
at
the
contrary
conclusion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
it
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suggest
that
this
procedure
was
bad,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
good.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i
understood
he
was
--
but
in
the
taylor
case,
he
was,
he
was
charged
of
being
a
communist,
but
in
this
case,
i
understood
that
he
was
--
he
was
charged
with
having
communist
beliefs,
that
he
was
charged
with
associating
with
his
wife
who
was
a
communist,
he
is
charged
with
associating
with
soviet
agents,
he
is
charged
with
associating
with
soviet
diplomats
and
other
things
from
which
no
person
in
this
day
and
age
could
gather
any
other
impression
than
that.
he
was
a
dangerous
individual
because
he
would
--
he
would
divulge
secrets
to
those
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
other
--
what
other
import
could
there
be
to
these
charges,
if
not
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
but
if
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
charge
him
with
having
--
having
contact
with
--
with
soviet
agents
and
he
says
that
the
reason
for
it
was
that
the
government
and
his
employer
was
trying
to
negotiate
some
contracts
with
him,
there
is
a
great
difference
of
opinion
between
the
purpose
for
--
for
which
he
says
he
saw
those
people
and
the
one
for
which
the
government
seeks
to
deny
him
access
to
--
to
secrets,
is
that
not
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
answer
that
after
lunch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
doub,
does
that
carry
into
the
conclusion
that
--
that
you
can
--
the
government
can
cause
the
result
that
happened
to
this
man
without
any
procedure
of
any
kind
and
without
giving
him
any
notice
of
any
kind
of
the
charges
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
i
didn't
ask
--
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
know
there
was
happening
here
eventually
but
--
but
does
it
carry
you,
does
your
argument
that
you
just
made,
carry
you
to
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that
isn't
exactly
the
--
if
i
may
finish
this.
that
isn't
exactly
the
way
i
understood
the
solicitor
general.
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
this
morning
to
--
to
say
that
some
procedure
must
be
given
to
this
man
and
that
if
it
was
arbitrary,
completely
arbitrary,
that
it
--
it
would
violate
his
rights.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
are
not
pointing
it
to
that.
may
i
ask,
if
it
wasn't
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
discharged
by
--
caused
to
be
discharged
by
the
letter
of
the
secretary
without
affording
him
any
procedure
of
any
kind
and
without
giving
him
any
information
of
any
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
he
was
already
(voice
overlap).
he
was
already
discharged,
wasn't
he?
and
he
didn't
get
it
for
some
seven
months
after
that.
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
referring
to
these
two
--
two
items
that
were
called
to
--
to
our
--
our
attention.
the
one
that
--
on
page
--
on
page
29
of
the
record
where
on
or
about
april
17th,
1953,
robert
b.anderson
sent
--
the
letter
set
forth
in
paragraph
5
of
the
complaint,
and
then
prior
to
the
letter
of
april
17th
referred
to
no
communication
of
any
kind
relating
to
the
action
of
robert
b.anderson
was
sent
to
the
plaintiff
and
his
employer.
and
except
his
hearing
set
forth,
there
was
no
direct
communication
between
the
department
of
defense
and
the
plaintiff.
so,
that's
what
caused
his
discharge.
now,
later
it's
true
he
did
have
a
hearing
some
seven
months
later
or
eight
months
later
before
the
eastern
industrial
personnel
security
board
but
at
that
time
it
stipulated
that
in
making
its
decision
the
board
took
into
consideration
the
whole
file
to
the
case
which
includes
information
neither
the
content
nor
source
of
which
has
been
--
has
been
revealed
to
plaintiff.
now,
that's
a
stipulation
of
the
parties
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
do
you
do
with
this
stipulation
that
i
just
read?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
this
stipulation
says
that
he
got
neither
the
content
nor
source
of
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
this
says
the
content,
your
stipulation,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
--
i
won't
bother
you
to
do
that
because
i
won't
read
them
right
now,
but
i
just
wondered
how,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
stipulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
you
certain
that
--
that
the
government
could
by
a
procedure
of
this
kind
or
lack
of
procedure
of
this
kind
so
circumscribe
the
activities
of
a
--
of
a
man
whether
within
or
without
the
plant
he
is
working
in
so
that
he
cannot
--
he
cannot
hold
the
kind
of
position
that
his
--
his
training
and
ability
entitle
him
to?
would
you
say
that
is
clear
that
they
could
do
that,
move
him
around
in
that
way
and
eventually
move
him
down
where
all
he
could
do
is
clean
up
the
building?
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
assume
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
that's
perfectly
all
right
to
take
and
do,
that
they
can
do
that,
but
i
don't
know
that
they
can
do
that.
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
been
established,
has
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
branding
him
--
by
branding
him
as
a
man
who
is
not
fit
to
--
to
have
--
have
these
secrets
because
of
his
associations
with
subversives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
if
they
want
to
say
if
a
man
had
been
convicted
of
--
of
rape
and
another
thing
if
they
were
just
some
anonymous
or
baseless
charge
against
him
that
he
--
he
had
done
such
a
thing
when
he
wanted
to
be
confronted
by
the
witness
against
him
and
was
denied
the
opportunity?
how
would
it
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
think
that
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doub,
when
was
this
man
denied
access
to
these
secrets?
what
date,
then
by
what
documents
or
by
what
act
was
he
denied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
letter
--
the
letter
that
--
that
secretary
anderson
wrote
to
him
and
just
tell
--
telling
him
that
he
was
denied
access.
now
there
were
no
procedure
of
any
kind
before
that,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
none
according
to
the
proceeding
that
the
--
the
regular
procedure
--yes,
there'd
been
a
--
he's
had
a
--
he'd
had
a
hearing
before
a
board
that
it
cleared
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
cleared
him,
yes
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
that
--
did
he
say
that
it
was
on
a
review
of
those
proceedings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
the
letter
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
you
and
your
argument
whether
they
were
--
were
employees
of
the
government,
undercover
agents
or
whether
they
were
just
casual
informers,
neighbors,
or
--
or
strangers,
or
whoever
it
might
be?
that
--
that's
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no.
i
was
--
i
don't
care
about
brownell's,
mr.
brownell's
statement,
i
just
like
to
get
your
opinion
in
--
in
how
far
you
go
on
your
argument.
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
in
this
case,
whether
it
were
known
as
a
fact,
how
many
of
these
were
witnesses
that
you
used
to
deprive
the
man
of
his
rights,
were
employees
of
the
government
and
--
and
therefore
in
a
confidential
relationship
or
how
many
of
them
might
have
been
people
who
just
wrote
in
and
said
we
--
this
man
is
a
communist.
we
know
he
does
so
and
so.
what
is
the
fact?
will
it
make
any
difference
to
you
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
berueffy.
