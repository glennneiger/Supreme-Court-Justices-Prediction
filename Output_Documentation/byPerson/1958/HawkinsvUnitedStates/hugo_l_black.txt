you
think
that
had
to
do
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
the
citation
is
to
that
case,
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
your
brief
here?

justice

black
page
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
he
did
represent
the
accused,
but
he
didn't
represent
her.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
the
way
he
could
object.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
have
to
do
that
to
protect
her
right,
if
it's
her
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
some
other
outside
person
have
to
tell
the
judge
to
advise
her
about
her
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it
he
wasn't
that
favorable
to
that
privilege,
was
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
which
was
she,
his
wife
or
ex-wife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
ex-wife
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rule,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
she
had
been
divorced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
you
think
there
is
any
relevance
to
the
fact
that
somebody
said
she
was
his
ex-wife
or
if
we
have
to
test
--
to
try
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
position
(inaudible).
do
you
read
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
as
making
that
evidence
inadmissible
of
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
have
you
any
–
has
the
court
ever
held
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
early
case
that
was
cited
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
want
to
get
at
was
is
this
your
argument,
that
although
that
has
been
the
rule,
the
common
law
rule,
that's
never
been
abandoned
by
this
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
should
now
abandon
the
rule
as
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
is
that,
i
don't
quite
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
party,
i
thought
you
said
there
should
be
one
rule
so
far
as
the
wife
is
concerned
and
one
for
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
want
to
do
away
with
the
rule
entirely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
looking
up
the
results
you
found
several
cases
where
it
looked
like
maybe
where
men
could
have
been
convicted
if
the
wives
could
have
testified
or
she
would
know
about
that
obviously
which
in
the
first
place
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
you
know,
that
he
is
turned
lose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
probably
you
might
find
a
better
number
of
articles
and
discussion
along
the
basis
that
there
is
no
vindictive
witness
in
the
world
than
a
wife
or
a
husband
against
their
spouse
and
they
don't
like
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
writing
--
can
you
get
an
experience
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
your
rule
is
--
your
rule
seems
to
me
to
be
that
should
the
wife
–
she'd
never
be
allowed
to
testify
against
her
husband
and
that
she
is
already
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
leave
it
up
to
her
--
if
you
leave
up
to
her
on
a
voluntary
basis
i
understood
you
to
say
that
when
she
did
come
on
a
voluntary
basis
(inaudible)
assigned,
they
already
split
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
possibility?
have
you
any
statistics
that
indicate
that
any
husband
whose
wife
has
testified
against
him
in
court
to
convict
him
of
a
crime
has
been
received
at
home
with
open
arms
after
that
testimony
was
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
serious
problem
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
feel
what,
i
didn't
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
gathered
from
your
argument
the
position
you
are
taking
is
that
the
public
policy
would
not
be
furthered
our
changing
the
rule
or
anybody
else
is
changing
the
rule
in
the
context,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
want
to
ask
you,
to
discuss
if
you
would,
the
reason
to
find
in
your
judgment
the
interest
of
the
courts
in
getting
evidence
is
not
enough
to
over
balance
the
interest
of
the
society
and
having
domestic
tranquility
and
peace.
that's
really
as
i
gather
it
that's
what
been
argued
here
this
morning,
a
lot
of
reference
to
cases
and
inconsistent
to
reference
but
the
argument
is
that
this
policy
which
has
been
effect
a
long
time
on
the
basis
of
preserving
domestic
tranquility
and
peace
should
now
be
changed
by
us
because
it
no
longer
is
true
that
that's
the
case,
that
the
(inaudible)
society
is
more
or
less
getting
in,
what
you
say
about
it,
what
are
your
reason
why
that's
not
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(inaudible)
points
outs
that
these
relative
cases
where
men
have
been
turned
loose
or
when
--
maybe
they
wouldn't
have
been
turned
loose
if
they
--
a
husband
or
wife
could
have
testified
against
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
that's
such
an
evil
that
we
ought
to
change
the
rule
and
see
that
it
comes
in,
well
is
that
right
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assume
that
quiet
a
number
are
turned
loose,
who
would
not
be
convicted,
who
would
be
convicted,
if
the
husband
or
the
wife
could
testify
against
it.
do
you
say
that
still
the
rule
should
be
continued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
are
to
judge
it
by
experience,
how
are
we
going
to
get
the
experience
here
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
congress
get
the
experience
better
than
we
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
limited
here
to
the
facts
in
the
record
and
that
which
we
judicially
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
deeply
rooted
rule,
over
a
long
period
of
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
rule
one
in
your
judgment,
is
the
best
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
reason
and
trust
experience.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
experience.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
how
it's
working.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
understand
that,
of
course
they
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
them
that
most
of
those
changes
had
been
made
by
legislation
or
have
they
been
made
by
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
exception,
do
you
remember?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
