mr.
byron
tunnell
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
bar.
first
i
would
like
to
say
in
answer
to
the
position
that
the
government
had
taken
in
the
statement
of
mr.
patterson
that
they
assume
that
since
the
record
in
this
case,
the
designated
record
in
this
case
was
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
the
wife
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
appeared
voluntarily
that
they
took
the
position
and
so
expressly
asserted
in
his
brief
that
she
did
appear
voluntarily.
but
let's
put
both
sides
of
this
doing
too
much
assuming
because
in
doing
what
the
actual
facts
were
we
would
have
contest
that
we
had
assumed
that
no
issue
would
be
raised
by
the
government
that
she
did
voluntarily
appear
and
so
the
record
you
don't
have
to
remain
silent
on
that
point.
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
if
i
understand
his
statement
he
would
willing
to
agree
that
mr.
king's
statement
that
she
was
not
only
subpoena,
but
the
incarcerated
and
required
to
make
bond
i
believe
he
did
expect
mr.
king's
statement
as
being
in
fact
same,
but
i
would
like
to
state
that
(inaudible)
mr.
king
states
the
facts
correctly
(inaudible)
mr.
byron
tunnell
we
feel
that
your
honor
record
here
does
not
show
anything
in
the
case
that
is
not
(inaudible)
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir,
the
record
was
not
fully
designated
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir
and
i'm
sure
we
could
obtain
affidavits
to
that
affect
too.
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir
it's
my
understanding
that
she
stayed
some
while
in
jail
before
she
was
able
to
bond
out,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
mr.
hawkins
in
at
the
time
that
he
had
to
get
out
before
he
could
get
her
out.
mr.
byron
tunnell
sir.
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir.
however,
the
position
that
the
government
has
taken
this
and
i
am
asking
his
argument
in
this
regard
he
takes
a
position
that
a
wife
should
be
required
that
the
government
should
be
able
to
subpoena
the
wife
into
court
and
then
place
that
witness
on
the
stand
and
then
if
she
desired
to
exercise
her
privilege
not
to
testify
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
which
you
would
then
have
to
do
that,
we
take
the
position
that
by
the
very
fact
of
subpoenaing
her
before
that
jury
and
placing
her
on
the
stand
and
requiring
her
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
either
testify
or
to
refuse
to
testify
is
in
effect
compelling
her
to
testify
or
else
is
penalizing
the
defendants.
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir,
it
would
be
easy,
i
was
just
answering
his
argument
that
he
would
take
the
position
that
she
should
have
denied
on
this
stand
after
they
called
her
in
that
she
did
not
want
to
testify.
mr.
byron
tunnell
well,
the
only
relevancy
i
see
is
that
i
am
attempting
to
answer
his
argument
and
not
i
had
copy
that
--
sir.
mr.
byron
tunnell
no
sir,
i
don't
feel
so.
well,
i
would
like
to
confine
my
argument
to
what
i
figure
is
really
the
relevant
matters
in
this
case
and
that
is
we
take
no
position
that
this
court
is
not
got
the
authority
to
change
this
rule
as
the
government
has
asked.
we
say
this
though,
that
if
the
rule
is
to
be
changed
or
altered
in
any
manner
i
think
you
will
in
accordance
to
rule
26
changes
based
upon
reason
and
experience
which
is
the
very
thing
that
prompted
this
court
to
do
in
the
funk
case.
now
you
will
note
from
the
record
that
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
is
very
short
in
that
they
simply
say
we
follow
the
yoder
case
and
we
don't
even
want
to
elucidate
any
further.
so
we
must
then
go
to
the
yoder
case
determine
why
this
particular
tenth
circuit
court
and
incidentally
as
the
only
circuit
court
to
this
very
date
to
advocate
this
change,
we
have
to
go
to
the
yoder
case
to
find
out
what
their
reason
was.
whereas
here
that
i
think
the
whole
point
was
missed
because
it
is
agreed
by
everybody
that
this
rule
which
prompted
the
court
to
change
the
funk
case
was
based
on
an
exclusion
of
the
witness
because
of
interest.
it
is
agreed
by
all
parties
i
think
that
the
rule
which
we
have
under
question
is
not
based
upon
on
excluding
their
testimony
because
of
interest,
if
because
of
public
policy
had
an
endeavor
to
maintain
and
support
we
can
domestic
tranquility.
so
they
are
based
on
two
different
reasons
yet
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion
of
the
yoder
case
which
appears
on
page
19
of
our
approval
--
our
brief,
which
indicates
clearly
what
the
--
one
of
the
court
arrived
at
their
decision
in
advocating
the
change
of
this
rule
that
we
are
moving
steadily
in
the
direction
of
allowing
the
trier
of
the
facts
to
hear
all
the
witnesses,
all
of
the
evidence,
the
interest
or
the
relationship
of
the
witnesses
to
the
party
being
given
due
consideration
in
weighing
its
value.
well
now
that
was
the
point
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
funk
case.
now
but
this
yoder
case
then
we
think
you
are
left
to
while
testify
but
we
are
moving
in
the
direction
of
allowing
the
trier
of
the
facts
to
hear
all
of
the
evidence
and
determine
their
--
the
testimony
on
its
weight.
well
that's
not
the
point
at
all
insofar
as
trying
to
maintain
domestic
tranquility
it's
not
a
matter
of
whether
the
testimony
would
have
great
weight
or
less
weight
it's
a
matter
whether
it
would
be
against
public
policy
to
permit
it
and
in
the
same
opinion
they
readily
acknowledge
the
wisdom
of
this
exclusion
of
the
communications
between
attorneys
and
clerks,
and
husbands
and
wife's
and
so
forth.
mr.
byron
tunnell
the
present
law
in
england?
mr.
byron
tunnell
sir
i
don't
believe
i
know.
they
recognized
the
wisdom
of
not
allowing
a
wife
to
testify
the
communications
between
husband
and
wife.
well
now
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
an
inconsistent
stand
to
say
we
should
allow
a
wife
to
testify
what
she
has
seen
her
husband
do,
but
we
should
not
for
fear
that
we
will
violate
the
domestic
tranquility,
we
will
not
let
her
testify
to
something
he
is
told
her
that
he
has
done.
now
actually
i
think
a
check
of
the
history
of
these
two
rules
will
find
that
the
real
basic
reason
for
allowing
as
privileged
communication
between
husband
and
wife
are
basically
based
upon
the
same
reason
as
not
allowing
a
wife
to
testify
against
her
husband
and
that
the
decision
decided
in
the
funk
case
was
altogether
in
different
form.
mr.
byron
tunnell
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
show
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
i
disagree
with
that
180
degrees
because
i
don't
feel
that
the
marriage
ceremony
or
the
vow
or
the
obligation
between
man
and
wife
has
changed
to
any
extent,
i
suspect
and
i
am
not
old
enough
to
know,
but
i
suspect
that
the
same
marriage
ceremony,
the
same
vows
were
repeated
in
blackstone
days
that
are
now
being
repeated
today.
i
don't
think
because
we
are
having
perhaps
more
divorces
and
so
forth
today
that,
that
indicates
that
marriage
is
not
just
as
sacred
to
most
people,
and
should
not
so
remain.
mr.
byron
tunnell
of
course
i
think
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
well
i
think
that's
only
an
assumption
on
his
part
that
there
would
have
been
a
conviction,
we
can't
say
i
don't
think
at
this
point
what
evidence
it
would
have
taken
to
have
gotten
a
conviction
or
whether
if
the
particular
party
had
been
allowed
to
testify
whether
or
not
that
testimony
would
have
convicted
and
otherwise
you
can
turn
loose,
i
think
have
only
have
to
assume
that.
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
byron
tunnell
well
i
think
that
public
policy
in
regard
to
all
americans
in
the
future
are
far
more
important
than
one
or
two
isolated
cases
that
we
can
think
of
which
would
result
in
harsh
results.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
law
that
can
be
passed,
that
you
can't
find
on
one
end
or
the
other
some
harsh
results,
but
can
you
say
that
it's
a
bad
law
because
in
a
few
isolated
instances
you
do
have
a
harsh
result?
mr.
byron
tunnell
i'll
tell
you
how
the
court
did
in
the
funk
case.
mr.
byron
tunnell
well
i'm
sure
they
supposedly
are
speaking
to
the
mandates
of
the
various
people
throughout
the
country,
they
are
the
personal
representatives
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir.
mr.
byron
tunnell
well
the
rule
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
you
mean
do
i
think
this
court
or
congress
is
best
qualified
to
determine
whether
this
rule
should
be
changed
or
not?
mr.
byron
tunnell
well
i
think
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
i
think
that
your
honors
are
nine
men
of
varied
experiences,
but
i
think
congress
is
450
who
constantly
come
into
contact
with
their
people
back
home
and
so
forth
and
are
probably
in
a
better
position
to
have
more
varied
experiences
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
rule
should
be
changed
and
is
this
(inaudible),
but
i'd
say
that
without
taking
the
position
that
this
court
can't
change
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
but
i
know
what
the
funk
case
did,
the
court
looked
at
what
had
happened
in
all
of
the
other
jurisdictions
and
we
have
made
a
check
of
those
jurisdictions
and
we
find
that
51
of
the
of
the
52
jurisdictions
which
includes
the
district
of
columbia,
the
alaska,
hawaii
and
philippine
islands,
51
of
those
52
are
in
complete
harmony
with
the
decision
around
that
in
the
funk
case,
and
that
it
was
in
the
funk
case
that
the
court
decided,
because
of
this
overwhelming
weight
of
authority,
what
the
other
states
adopted,
that
they
felt
that
the
rule,
the
reason
upon
which
that
rule
no
longer
existed.
now
we've
also
made
a
check
on
this
particular
rule,
now
incidentally
georgia
was
the
only
state
excepting,
georgia
still
didn't
permit
a
wife
to
testify
for
her
case,
her
husband
as
the
old
common
law
rule
was
back
for
the
graves
--
during
the
graves
case
decision.
we
have
made
a
check
now
and
we
find
that
--
and
i'd
like
to
adopt
the
government's
brief
on
this,
because
it's
more
in
our
favor,
they
find
eight
states,
but
we
find
that
17
of
the
52
jurisdictions,
17
of
the
49
jurisdictions
is
what
it
is
are
competent
and
compelling
--
and
are
compellable,
competent
and
are
compellable.
well
that
would
show
that
32
of
our
49
jurisdictions
that
were
checked
there,
still
hold
what
the
common
law
rule
and
the
rule
of
long
standing
that
a
wife
should
not
be
permitted
to
testify
against
her
husband.
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir,
i
reveal
sure
that
all
had
been
made
by
legislature
with
one
possible
exception,
that
all
of
the
changes
which
had
been
made
were
by
legislation.
mr.
byron
tunnell
illinois.
mr.
byron
tunnell
now
actually
illinois
has
a
statute
on
it,
but
a
case
has
come
along
and
construed
that
and
made
it
more
clearly
and
i
say
with
that
possible
exception
illinois
you
may
have
to
go
to
cases
already
determined,
but
otherwise
the
decisions
have
been
made
legislatively.
so
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
thing
that
confronted
the
court
in
the
funk
case
was
that
they
found
by
checking
what
the
other
states
had
done
and
what
the
other
commentaries
were
saying
about
it,
that
the
reason
simply
no
longer
existed,
that
that
the
public
requirement
for
that
change,
but
they
don't
--
you
don't
find
that,
that
same
thing
doesn't
confront
this
court
now
because
you
find
only
a
few
of
the
states
who
advocate
this
change.
so
what
we
have
is
we
actually
have
this
17,
plus
one
circuit
court
because
one
(inaudible)
circuit
federal
court,
not
(inaudible),
that
the
graves
case
was
decided,
then
they,
the
funk
case
was
decided
which
knocked
away
one,
then
came
another
circuit
court
of
appeal
which
was
the
paul
case
and
it
was
decided
after
the
funk
case,
but
it
still
went
with
the
decision
in
the
graves
case
insofar
as
our
rule
was
concerned.
then
came
the
yoder
case
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeal
and
though
it
was
--
the
proposition
was
not
before
the
court
because
the
wife
was
in
fact
divorced,
they
still
by
the
way
of
dicta
advocated
the
abolition
of
this
rule.
then
came
the
brunner
case,
after
the
yoder
case
and
they
choose
to
go
as
exactly
as
did
the
paul
case
and
then
came
the
walker
case
as
late
as
1949
and
they
sat
on
them.
the
brunner,
the
yoder,
the
paul,
the
funk,
right
on
back
to
the
graves
and
they
still
go
with
the
common
law
rule
as
it
now
exists.
the
tenth
circuit
of
appeals
by
way
of
dicta
in
the
yoder
case
and
for
the
first
time
directly
in
this
hawkins
case,
is
the
only
federal
court
yet
which
has
advocated
this
change
directly
and
the
17
states
and
that
showed.
now
the
walker
case
in
its
opinion
said,
we
don't
know
whether
the
rule
is
going
to
be
changed
or
not,
we
are
not
going
to
change.
we
will
await
action
of
congress
or
the
overwhelming
adoption
by
the
states
as
(inaudible)
to
action
in
the
funk
case
before
we
will
change
our
opinion
and
so
they
are
still
waiting
for
the
overwhelming
adoption
by
the
states
which
obviously
doesn't
appear
here,
or
the
action
of
congress
or
this
court,
and
i'll
say
this
that
the
rule
to
be
laid
down
in
this
case,
all
(inaudible)
the
importance
of
this
particular
cases
before
the
court
is
going
to
be
controlling
many,
many
situations
and
not
these
particular
isolated
cases.
it
is
in
my
opinion
the
only
thing
really
material
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
situation
does
not
confront
this
court,
it
confronted
it
in
the
funk
case
because
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
states
advocated
the
change
in
the
funk
case,
they
do
not
in
this
case
and
that's
what
we
call
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience,
it
shows
that
the
reason
and
experience
has
not
raised
it's
ugly
head
yet
and
clamored
for
a
change
of
the
rule,
but
on
contrary
have
been
content
to
stay
with
a
common
law
rule
of
what
we
consider
to
be
an
intelligent
ruling
and
one
certainly
of
long
stand.
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir.
mr.
byron
tunnell
well
i
was
going
to
answer
this
argument
sir,
because
he
did
get
on
his
arguments,
but
in
answer
to
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
--
to
another
one
i
moved
on.
i
say
this
that
for
the
government
to
come
in
here
and
say
well
this
was
just
a
little
bit
of
testimony.
mr.
byron
tunnell
sir?
mr.
byron
tunnell
oh
yes
sir,
the
court
said
it,
but
of
course
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
well
i
say
that
they
are
not
right
up.
i
say
that
the
testimony
was
harmful.
i
think
the
testimony
was
harmful
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir
i
will
give
you
reasons.
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
ordinary
thing
that
you
may
be
dealing
with
on
harmless
error
rule.
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
now
that
will
convict
a
man,
not
on
direct
testimony,
but
on
--
because
you
can
use
circumstances
and
inferences
in
determining
a
man's
purpose,
and
that's
what
this
was,
was
an
intent
violation,
that
is
he
must
have
transported
this
girl
for
immoral
purposes.
now
you
have
to
determine
those
immoral
purposes
from
a
set
of
circumstances.
now
if
it
takes
50
pounds
of
circumstances
to
prove
that,
then
how
many
pounds
of
circumstances
was
this
wife's
testimony?
was
this
wife's
testimony
the
last
four
pounds
that
put
it
over
the
50
pound
and
convinced
the
jury
that
his
purpose
was
immoral?
since
we're
dealing
with
circumstances,
how
can
we
say
that
it
was
not
the
wife's
testimony,
her
very
presence
of
being
in
the
courtroom,
admitting
to
be
being
a
prostitute,
admitting
that
she
had
been
a
prostitute
prior
to
marrying
the
defendant
and
that
she
was
acting
as
a
prostitute
during
the
time
that
this
case
was
committed.
how
can
we
say
that,
that
was
not
the
testimony
that
actually
with
all
the
other
circumstances
would
ride
on
over
and
convince
that
jury
that
it
was
for
immoral
purposes
that
he
delivered
this
girl.
so
i
say
it
is
wrong,
i
say
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir,
the
government
doesn't
always
say
will
this
is
--
this
testimony
was
not
harmful,
but
let
me
point
out
this,
since
it's
now
stipulated
that
the
government
went
to
considerable
expense
of
subpoenaing
her,
of
incarcerating
her,
of
requiring
her
to
make
bond,
of
calling
her
to
the
witness
stand,
of
swearing
her
in
and
asking
her
direct
questions.
she
answered
every
question
that
they
asked
and
now
they
come
along
and
say
but
it
was
not
material.
well,
if
it
was
not
material
why
did
they
go
to
all
that
trouble
to
subpoena?
it
seems
to
me
that
they
could
have
asked
other
questions
if
they
wanted
to.
they
asked
whatever
questions
they
wanted
to
ask,
they
must
have
considered
it
material
to
the
prosecution
of
their
case,
or
they
would
not
go
to
all
that
trouble
to
put
her
on,
but
now
that
they
have,
and
they
fear
what
might
be
the
result,
they
say
well
it
was
harmless,
i
don't
think
that
harmless
error
rule
was
intended
to
apply
to
a
thing
this
deliberate,
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
matters
of
technicality,
that
may
inadvertently
or
otherwise
come
into
court,
but
not
one
that
was
premeditated
like
this
in
matters
of
substances
--
mr.
byron
tunnell
yes
sir,
that's
the
substance
of
it,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
(inaudible)
yes
well
the
substance
of
it.
mr.
byron
tunnell
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
as
to
whether
it
was
offered,
but
i
didn't
intend
to
get
into
it,
it's
just
an
answer
to
his
question.
thank
you.
