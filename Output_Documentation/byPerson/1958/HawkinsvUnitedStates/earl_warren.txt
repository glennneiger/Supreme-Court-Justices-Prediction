number
20,
james
clifton
hawkins,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
king.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
doesn't
the
testimony
begin
on
the
page
40?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
take
a
look
at
40?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
patterson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
she
under
subpoena
here
and
was
she
under
bond
to
testify?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
she
was
under
bond
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
quite
say
that
when
she
is
not
only
under
subpoena,
but
she
is
under
bond
to
testify?
that
she
is
compelled
--
she
is
prevented
from
leaving
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
or
going
away
to
prevent
testifying.
how
can
you
say
that,
that
doesn't
bear
on
the
question
of
compulsion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
she
also
testify
that
what
her
assumed
name
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
that
in
the
evidence
otherwise?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
what
i
ask
you,
i
ask
you
if
there
was
any
other
testimony
in
the
record
that
is
to
show
that
she
was
jane
wilson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
put
her
on
for
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
does
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
enter
into
this
question
that
we
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
we
testing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
(inaudible)
he
is
convicted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
patterson,
before
you
get
to
that,
if
we
are
to
use
our
rule
making
power,
what
you
say
congress
has
confided
to
us,
we
are
going
to
change
the
long
standing
rule
of
this
kind
why
shouldn't
we
do
it
in
the
manner
that
congress
contemplated,
namely
by
promulgating
a
rule
and
submitting
it
to
congress
so
that
congress
would
have
the
right
to
approve
it
or
disprove
it
as
it
sees
fit.
that's
the
rule
making
power
not
--
aren't
we
confusing
two
things
when
you
talk
about
confiding
the
rule
making
power
to
us
and
then
ask
us
in
a
decision
to
change
the
whole
course
of
history,
so
far
as
marital
relationship
is
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
both
of
which
must
be
submitted
to
congress
for
its
approval.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
congress
have
that
right
here,
we
would
be
going
around
the
rule
making
power
when
deciding
it
this
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
don't
say
we
haven't,
but
you
were
relying
on
this
specific
power
to
make
rules
that
congress
had
given
to
the
court?
it
does
contemplate
referring
those
rules
to
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
are
in
your
brief
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
tunnell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
also
mr.
tunnell,
wasn't
this
the
testimony
that
the
government
relied
on
to
prove
that
the
jane
wilson
who
was
implicated
in
this
manner
and
who
handled
the
17-year
old
girl
was
the
jane
wilson
who
was
the
wife
of
this
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
correct
in
this
that
(inaudible)
did
ask
her
on
direct
examination
where
the
three
crucial
things,
did
you
go
under
assumed
name
of
jane
wane?
were
you
a
prostitute
at
that
time?
where
you
the
wife
of
this
defendant?
isn't
that
right,
isn't
that
the
substance
of
her
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
patterson
in
view
of
your
argument
that
this
appearance
of
the
woman
was
voluntary,
there
are
some
members
of
the
court
who
would
like
to
have
you
supplement
the
record
by
showing
whether
she
was
incarcerated
and
if
so
under
what
circumstance
and
for
how
long,
whether
she
was
required
to
get
bond
and
if
she
did
get
bond
and
also
as
to
whether
she
was
under
subpoena.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
we
will
recess
now.
