mr.
kenneth
r.
king
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
arisen
out
of
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
james
clifton
hawkins
in
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma
for
the
offense
of
knowingly
transporting
one
lola
fay
moudy
in
interstate
commerce
for
immoral
purpose.
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
were
filed
and
granted
in
this
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
one
lola
fay
moudy
and
the
petitioner
had
a
conservation
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
the
witness,
later
became
the
witness
lola
fay
moudy,
told
the
petitioner
that
she
would
like
to
make
more
money
while
she
was
working
there
in
the
tavern.
and
the
petitioner
asked
her
if
she
would
like
to
go
over
to
tulsa
and
work
with
jane.
the
witness
lola
moudy
understood
that
working
with
jane
meant
working
as
prostitute.
thereafter
the
petitioner
and
lola
fay
moudy
journeyed
from
a
point
in
--
from
a
town
in
oklahoma
to
a
point
in
a
town
in
arkansas
and
then
back
across
the
line
to
tulsa,
oklahoma.
they
arrived
in
tulsa,
oklahoma
at
approximately
3:30
or
4
o'
clock
in
the
morning,
when
the
petitioner
got
out
his
automobile
which
was
identified
as
the
car
that
the
two
people
were
traveling
in
by
other
witnesses,
he
got
out
of
the
car
and
made
a
telephone
call
and
shortly
thereafter
a
person
named
jane
and
another
person
named
tommy
came
out
to
the
car
and
jane,
tommy
and
lola
fay
who
was
then
being
called
tommy
mcguire
went
to
a
hotel
where
tommy
mcguire
did
not
register
but
stayed
in
the
room
with
jane
and
tommy
and
there
they
instructed
her
on
various
items
of
that
business.
and
then
later
that
day
the
petitioner
by
the
way
did
not
go
to
the
hotel,
but
left,
but
later
that
day
the
--
johnny
mcguire
or
lola
fay
moudy
her
real
name,
the
main
witness
went
to
another
hotel
and
there
engaged
in
prostitution
where
she
was
arrested
and
then
tommy
went
down
and
paid
a
fine
and
got
her
out.
later
she
decided
to
quit
and
jane,
tommy
and
johnny,
the
three
girls
went
back
across
to
the
state
of
arkansas
where
the
petitioner
met
them
and
then
the
prosecuting
witness
lola
fay
moudy
known
as
johnny
went
back
to
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
thereafter
did
not
engage
in
any
prostitution.
now,
this
case
was
brought
up
on
the
main
point
that
in
this
--
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
petitioner's
wife
was
allowed
to
testify
as
a
government
witness.
she
testified
to
only
one
or
two
facts
which
were
not
otherwise
in
evidence
and
those
two
facts
were
that
she
was
the
wife
of
petitioner
and
the
person
known
as
jane
wilson.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
this
was
a
jury
trial
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
there
the
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
yes,
your
honor
there
is
the
point
of
where
the
evidence
offered
by
the
wife
was
prejudicial
to
the
petitioner.
there
are
two
points;
one
the
harmless
error.
now
as
far
as
the
harmless
is
concerned
or
the
prejudicial
testimony
of
the
wife
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
wife
in
the
record,
she
is
known
as
(inaudible)
hawkins,
it
is
at
page
48,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
page
54.
when
she
was
called
to
the
stand,
the
petitioner's
counsel
objected
to
her
testimony
because
they
were
still
married
at
that
time
and
the
court
overruled
the
objection
and
she
testified
to
--
about
her.
she
testified
that
she
was
a
prostitute
and
had
been
during
november
of
1955
that
she
was
known
as
jane
wilson
and
had
been
a
prostitute
before
she
married
the
petitioner.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
54
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
yes,
40
and
41
and
42.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
i
understand
that
your
honor,
however
the
respondent
raised
the
question
of
harmless
error
in
his
reply.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
i
will
limit
my
argument
then
only
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
all
right.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
the
petitioner
says
that
the
trial
court
committed
error
in
allowing
the
--
permitting
the
wife
of
the
petitioner
to
testify
as
a
government
witness.
the
rule
that
a
wife
could
not
testify
for
or
against
her
spouse
is
of
course
a
long
standing
was
by
the
early
treatise
writer
recognized
and
in
the
maine
case,
the
case
often
cited,
the
stein
versus
bowman
case,
cited
in
the
18th
century
was
repeated
and
in
the
case
of
us
versus
graves,
by
this
court,
was
reiterated
or
repeated
wherein
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
commented
on
the
failure
of
the
wife
to
testify
in
his
argument
to
a
jury,
and
in
that
case
the
court
says
that
the
comment
that
the
wife
was
an
incompetent
witness
and
that
the
comment
by
the
prosecution
on
her
failure
to
testify
was
therefore
improper.
later
in
1933,
this
court
decided
the
(inaudible)
case
which
removed
the
restriction
of
the
rule
and
permitted,
a
part
of
the
rule,
permitted
the
wife
to
testify
for
a
husband,
but
left
open
the
question
as
to
whether
the
wife
could
testify
against
her
husband,
and
that
was
in
1933.
in
1935
the
tenth
circuit
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
yoder,
yoder
versus
united
states,
had
the
same
question
presented
to
it
as
this
court
now
has
with
the
exception
that
in
that
case
at
the
time
the
wife
was
testifying
against
her
husband
she
was
divorced
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
and
by
way
of
dicta
they
indicated
that
the
rule
that
the
wife
could
not
testify
against
her
husband
had
no
further
use.
then
the
--
within
a
few
years
the
two
other
circuit
courts,
three
other
circuit
courts
held
that
it
was
error
for
the
wife
to
be
permitted
to
testify
against
her
husband.
now,
this
is
the
present
case
is
the
first
case
where
the
point
is
raised
directly,
that
is
the
first
case
where
the
wife
was
permitted
to
testify
against
her
husband.
now
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
the
record
is
silent
on
that
part
your
honor.
i
have
personal
knowledge
of
it
that
she
was
subpoenaed,
and
held
for
bond
as
a
government
witness.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
but
it's
not
in
the
record
your
honor.
now
the
early
reasons
given
for
the
rule
that
the
wife
could
not
testify
against
her
husband
were
mainly
three
reasons.
one
was,
that
it
was
to
preserve
marital
peace,
in
other
words
the
peace
of
the
marriage
was
felt
to
be
more
important
than
this
privilege.
and
there
that
reason
was
given
by
blackstone
and
whitmore
repeated
in
stein
versus
bowman
and
again
in
yoder
versus
united
states.
now
that
marital
peace
reason
still
exists.
the
doctrine
that
the
wife
cannot
testify
as
to
competential
communications
between
husband
and
wife
has
the
same
reason
and
the
government
--
no
one
else
has
ever
urged
that
the
rule
which
will
not
allow
the
wife
to
testify
as
to
privilege
communication
should
be
abolished.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
i
am
sorry
that
i
do
not
either,
your
honor.
that
the
second
reason
for
the
rule
is
that
it
would
be
naturally
repugnant
for
the
wife
to
be
permitted
to
testify
against
her
husband.
now
the
respondent
has
raised
in
his
brief
that
it
is
repugnant
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime.
he
has
the
repugnancy
running
to
the
accused.
however,
a
closer
reading
will
show
that
the
natural
repugnancy
reason
is
--
runs
to
the
public
that
it
is
a
matter
of
public
policy,
that
it
is
naturally
repugnant
to
the
public
to
allow
wives
to
testify
against
their
husbands.
now
the
third
reason
for
the
rule
often
given
is
that
to
forbid
the
wife
to
testify
against
her
husband
would
hold
invalid
the
marriage
relationship.
it
can
be
said
now
that
the
marriage
relationship
is
any
less
sacred
than
it
was
when
these
reasons
were
given
back
as
early
as
the
17th
century
and
repeated
throughout
the
time
until
this
date.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
sorry
mr.
justice
i
am
not
versed
on
psychology
either.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
they
were
separated
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
the
cases
here
therefore
have
not
considered
the
separation.
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
walker
the
parties
were
separated
and
at
that
time
i
think
a
divorce
petition
was
filed
though
they
were
still
made
at
the
time
of
the
testimony
and
the
noted
passage
of
justice
learned
hand
was
that
the
situation
would
probably
not
arise
unless
they
were
separated,
that
the
wife
would
give
testimony
against
her
husband.
but
he
said
that
the
possibility
of
reconciliation
would
be
removed
and
for
that
reason
that
they
was
not
pertinent
whether
they
were
separated
or
not
separated.
now
the
question
that
we
have
here,
just
as
the
question
in
the
funk
case
was,
should
the
rule
survive
the
reasons
for
the
rule.
now
we
say
that
the
reasons
for
the
rule
existed
then
when
these
cases,
prior
cases
were
decided
and
when
these
commentaries
were
written
and
we
say
that
those
rules
and
the
reasons
for
them
exist
to
date.
the
rule
that
competential
communications
are
privileged
is
founded
upon
the
same
reasons.
the
government
contents
that
the
wife,
that
the
privilege
should
lie
with
the
wife
and
not
the
accused
to
exclude
the
testimony
that
--
that
is
distinction
is
that
the
witness
is
competent
but
not
compellable
to
testify.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
no,
your
honor
i
liken
the
reasons
for
the
rule
of
competential
communications
with
the
reasons
for
the
rule
that
the
wife
is
incompetent
to
testify
against
her
husband.
they
have
the
same
reasons.
mr.
kenneth
r.
king
that's
right
your
honor.
she
is
not
competent
or
compellable
to
testify
against
her
husband
and
i
cite
the
reason
for
the
rule
of
competential
communications
to
liken
it
to
this
--
the
reasons
for
this
rule.
now
in
the
light
of
reason
which
the
rule
26
says
that
this
court
can
interpret
the
common
law
rules
of
evidence
in
the
light
of
reason,
there
is
no
reason
for
this
rule
to
be
changed.
by
experience
there
is
no
reason
for
this
rule
to
be
changed
in
that
the
states,
the
49
states,
48
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
examined
the
petitioner
show,
that
in
those
states
that
there
were
13
states
in
which
the
wife
was
held
competent
to
testify
against
her
husband
out
of
the
40,
49
jurisdictions
and
in
17
states
held
that
she
was
competent
but
not
compellable
to
testify
against
the
other.
that
is
the
reasoning
used
in
the
funk
case
for
the
ablation
of
the
rule
that
would
permit
the
wife
to
testify
for
her
husband.
they
use
that
as
a
guide
in
showing
that
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience,
the
rule
should
be
changed.
now
in
the
funk
case
the
reason
and
experience
had
changed.
the
reason
that
the
wife
did
not
testify
for
her
husband
was
on
the
grounds
of
interest,
that
if
she
had
an
interest
in
the
case
and
that
her
testimony
would
therefore
be
incompetent.
and
after
the
different
courts
and
legislators
removed
the
interest
disqualification
and
allowed
the
defendant
himself
to
testify,
then
there
the
funk
case
rightly
removed
the
prohibition
of
the
wife
to
testifying
for
her
husband.
now
the
first
rule,
the
rule
that
we
are
concerned
with
which
is
the
wife
cannot
testify
against
her
husband,
the
states
nor
the
jurisdictions
have
not
overruled
or
have
not
stated
in
their
opinions
that
these
reasons
for
the
rule
do
not
exist,
that
is
the
preservation
of
the
marital
peace
and
the
repugnancy
of
reason
are
to
hold
invalid
the
marriage
relationship,
those
still
exist.
and
therefore
the
petitioner
submits
that
the
rule
should
not
be
changed
but
the
reasons
for
the
rule
which
would
make
the
wife
incompetent
and
the
reasons
for
the
rule
which
would
make
her
non-compellable,
and
the
reasons
for
the
rule
which
would
permit
--
which
would
prevent
confidential
communications
from
being
received
into
testimony
are
all
the
same
and
that
they
all
still
exist
and
that
there
is
no
reason
now
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience
why
this
common
law
prohibition
for
the
wife
to
testifying
against
her
husband
should
be
abolished.
