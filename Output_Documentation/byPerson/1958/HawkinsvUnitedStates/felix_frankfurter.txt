justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
the
main
point,
is
there
any
other
point
except
the
competence
of
this
particular
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
us,
is
there
any
other
point
except
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
king
i
asked
my
question
because
on
your
petition
for
certiorari
you
presented
only
one
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
is
not
accustomed
to
considering
questions
not
raised
in
application
for
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
the
respondent
does.
the
petitioner
determines
the
scope
of
our
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
just
suggesting
my
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all
the
questions
presented
have
some
purpose,
so
that's
the
basis
on
which
we
grant
or
do
not
grant
or
grant
in
a
limited
fashion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
she
subpoenaed
or
did
she
volunteer
as
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
may
know
as
justice
harlan
suggests
more
about
psychology.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
surprised
you
don't
refer
to
chief
justice
marshall's
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
subpoena
could
be
issued
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
it
doesn't
follow,
that
he
can
be
compelled
to
come.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
object
to
the
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
that
an
attorney
objects
to
testimony,
objected
in
any
particular
way,
he
said
that
inquiry
is
not
proper.
it
should
be
ruled
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
asserted
an
objected
to
protect
his
client
against
damaging
evidence
that
he
didn't
want
to
be
introduced,
didn't
want
to
have
introduced.
is
it
any
more
or
less
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
testimony
was
incompetent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that's
the
reason
they
gave.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
harlan
and
i
used
to
practice
before
a
judge
who
wanted
to
you
to
be
as
brief
as
possible.
the
ground
he
gave
was
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
he
knew
all
there
was
to
know
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
particular?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
all
the
distinction
in
the
world
whether
a
woman
bears
a
relation
(inaudible),
man
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
then
why
talk
about
it
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
question,
i
think
if
i
may
say
so,
it
would
be
pertinent
for
you
to
argue
the
suggestion
along
the
lines
of
mr.
justice
whitaker,
namely
that
the
spouses
are
not
living
together,
but
it
simply
makes
for
confusion
to
talk
about
ex-wife
as
against
wife,
if
ex-wife
means
she
is
no
longer
his
wife,
then
there
is
no
problem.
(inaudible)
what
might
have
taken
place,
while
they
were
husband
and
wife?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
if
they
are
not
separated
is
a
relevant
argument
on
the
fundamental
question,
the
public
policy
which
will
go
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
gather
from
what
you've
said
mr.
patterson
that
you
think
the
considerations
now
nullify
as
i
understand
it,
right,
i
suppose
every
state
certainly
this
court
(inaudible)
that
a
party,
any
party
cannot
testify
in
his
favor
because
of
the
danger
of
virtually
to
self
interest,
you
say
since
that
ground
for
incompetence
is
gone
the
same
should
apply
to
the
husband
and
wife
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
the
other
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
saying
funk
represents
a
general
and
not
a
--
dichotomous
principle,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
equation
which
you
offered
a
minute
ago
was
self
evident
proposition
would
be
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
results
of
how
do
you,
how
do
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
livingston's
distinction
though
he
rejected
the
incompetent
--
what
do
say
the
distinction
he
had
made,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
an
innocent
man
owing
to
his
debt
because
his
wife
can't
exculpate
it,
and
that
which
(inaudible)
but
on
the
whole
he
thought
the
public
good
was
more
important
namely
to
testify
against
the
man
who
is
guilty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
maybe
exactly
right
or
wrong
but
he
recognized
that
it's
not
in
the
equation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
in
innocence
scope
that
in
--
innocence
incapable
of
being
established
is
one
thing
and
having
a
wife
or
a
mother
and
a
husband
or
a
father
(inaudible)
is
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
make
an
equation
out
there,
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
of
course
you
think
shakespeare
weighs
heavily
against
the
equation,
his
judgment
about
a
scorned
woman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your,
is
your
ground,
what
is
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
could
you
please
state
your
reason
in
policy
why
that
spouse
witness
should
be
allowed
to
a
certain
privilege.
since
we
spoke
to
general
dependency
right
(inaudible)
my
thought
of
allowing
everything
that's
relevant
in,
why
do
you
walk
at
getting
her,
why
do
you
restrict
that
so
that
she
can
decide
wilfully
or
whimsically
or
for
any
reason
whether
she
will
(inaudible)
that's
the
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
time
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that,
even
today
with
all
the,
what
are
called
advances
husband
and
wife
relation
isn't
just
an
ordinary
partnership,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
fictitious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
a
strong
civic
sense
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
statistically
demonstrable
inclusion
of
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
statistical
(inaudible)
they
have
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
to
you
this
mr.
patterson
of
how
much
this
lies
in
the
realm
of
judgment
in
which
(inaudible)
what
the
basis
of
the
judgment
is
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
take
livingston
who
was
for
abolishing
this,
why
don't
you
make
absolutely
attorney's
privilege?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
that
he
would
be
more
stricter
with
regard
to
the
attorney's
privilege
than
the
common
law.
for
myself
i
have
no
greater
respect
to
any
fellow
whoever
wrote
on
evidence
for
livingstone
and
the
totality
(inaudible)
i
think
his
code
is
the
best
thing
we've
done
in
english
language
for
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
yet
you've
got
in
sticking
in
the
(inaudible)
and
that
privilege
is
an
absolute
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
you
–
i'm
saying
you
wouldn't,
you
wouldn't
met
the
client
release
an
attorney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
because
he
thought
that
was
a
public
interest
which
is
not
to
be
judged
by
the
particular
case
and
because
he
got
there
were
pressures
on
the
clients
(inaudible)
and
so
here
i
don't
think
you
can
get
very
far,
you
just
consider
this
case,
in
this
case,
the
matter
of
unity
was
destroyed
hopelessly
through
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
this
for
you
mr.
patterson
--
the
question
isn't
merely
how
to
weigh
things
that
are
imponderable
but
who
should
weigh?
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
question
whether
the
court
is
a
good
determinant
of
these
psychological
considerations
for
the
expression
the
more
what
shall
i
say,
presumably
the
more
responsible
expression,
the
common
feeling
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
i
am
usually
not
a
great
friend
of
having
legislature
(inaudible)
but
if
this
kind
of
a
thing
of
weighing
all
these
things,
are
you
going
to
consider
whether
we
as
a
(inaudible)
unsettle
something
that's
been
settled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
there
is
a
whole
code
of
evidence
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
way
of
carrying
the
confidence
which
has
congress
has
imposed
in
this
is
to
say
we
don't
know
enough
to
change
what
has
been
the
law
until
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
tell
right
now
what
statutory
changes
on
this
have
taken
place
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
18
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
my
figures
correct
from
what
you
say
that
figures
have
statutorily
adhered
to
the
common
law
neither
competent
certainly
not
compellability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
patterson,
can
i
ask
you
whether,
in
the
first
place
to
keep
in
would
you
canvas
(inaudible)
whether
it
appears
that
in
no
sense
to
the
children
or
the
offspring
of
the
particularly
unhappy
family,
secondly
whether
the
commentators
to
whom
you
refer
(inaudible)
whether
they
consider
the
effect
on
offspring
or
children
of
having
their
parents
in
this
not
(inaudible)
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
tunnell
would
the
--
if
this
court
wanted
to
amplify
the
record
in
order
to
confirm
what
appeared
as
of
record
in
the
trial
court
would
it
shows
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
the
record
before
us
but
if
we
had
the
stenographic
minutes
of
the
journal
entries
or
whatever
they
are
called,
the
fact
to
confirm
mr.
king's
statement
that
she
was
a
subpoenaed
and
she
was
bonded
to
testify
as
the
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
stated
also
incarcerated,
did
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
was
still
on
that
kind
of
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
still
on
that
kind
of
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
mr.
tunnell
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
having
indicated
to
mr.
king
that
you
should
have
raised
the
question
of
harmless
error,
i
now
will
ask
you
what
you
have
to
say
on
that
subject,
not
about
(inaudible),
but
on
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
we
don't
reach
that
question
here,
because
this
is
harmless
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
the
court
said
it
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
said
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
are
right,
if
they
are
right
and
if
it
is
ultimately
before
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
give
me
reasons
for
that?
