mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
point
out
at
outset
of
this
argument,
that
the
government
is
not
contending
that
a
wife
should
be
a
compelled
witness.
we
are
contending,
however,
that
a
wife
or
a
spouse,
it
can
be
reversed
of
course,
in
ordinary
cases
it
is
a
wife,
a
wife
should
not
be
summoned
by
the
will
of
the
accused
for
her
husband.
in
other
words
we
are
asking
the
court
to
establish
a
rule
which
will
permit
voluntary
testimony,
but
which
will
not
make
it
compellable.
now
actually
we
are
going
somewhat
farther
in
during
that,
than
we
would
be
required
to
do
so.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
you
may.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
record
does
not
say.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
fact
i
assume
is
as
stated
by
mr.
king,
that
just
as
he
states.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
what
he
states,
and
i'm
sure
that
what
he
states
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
however,
and
the
question
of
compelability
is
not
determined
particularly
by
whether
or
not
the
witness
is
brought
into
court
under
subpoena
or
whether
he
or
she
is
sworn.
this
record
is
entirely
silent
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
say
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
i
say
it
on
the
basis
two
cases
i
would
like
to
cite
to
your
honors,
and
also
on
the
basis
of
mr.
wigmore's
treatise,
one
of
them
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
because
as
i
start
to
say,
we
rather
assume
that
since
the
record
showed
nothing
indicated
the
opposite
of
voluntariness,
in
other
words
compulsion,
therefore
she
was
a
voluntary
witness
and
should
be
assumed
by
the
court
to
be
a
voluntary
witness.
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
because
mr.
chief
justice,
in
order
to
assert
a
privilege,
the
witness
has
to
be
called
into
court
and
she
may
consent
to
testify
and
she
may
refuse
to
testify,
and
it
is
only
when
she
refuses
to
testify
that
any
element
of
compulsion
may
come
into
the
case,
and
it
is
my
basis
for
that
statement.
now
i
cite
this
case
of
united
states
against
kimbell
in
117
fd
at
156
and
particularly
at
163,
where
the
defendants
were
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury.
they
made
no
claim
of
constitutional
privilege
or
that
they
were
being
compelled
to
testify
against
themselves.
later
on
they
attempted
to
quash
the
indictment
because
of
that.
the
court
reasons
in
upholding
the
convention
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
117
fd
at
156
and
163.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
sir
it's
not
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
117
fd,
yes
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
156
and
particularly
at
163.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
united
states
against
kimbell.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i'm
not
acquainted
to
that.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
quite
correct,
that's
quite
correct.
as
i
was
saying
in
this
case,
it
was
held
that
the
person
cannot
claim
his
privilege
until
he
is
sworn.
compulsion
does
not
arise
from
summoning
and
swearing
the
witness.
it
was
said
further
that
let
the
witness
exhibit
his
unwillingness
in
some
manner,
he
cannot
--
his
unwillingess
cannot
be
presumed
to
exist.
exemptions
are
allowed
only
to
those
who
ask.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
she
did
not.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
court
did
not
nor
apparently
did
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
here
make
the
request
to
the
court
to
advice
her.
in
my
opinion,
if
you
wish
to
raise
the
point
and
didn't
wish
to
communicate
with
her
in
advance,
and
tell
her
what
her
rights
were,
he
should
have
asked
the
court.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
he
objected
to
it
in
this
language
and
i
was
coming
to
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
he
said
i
object
first.
then
he
said
i
object,
because
she
was
his
wife.
in
other
words,
he
made
his
objection
as
attorney
for
the
petitioner.
he
did
not
attempt
to
serve
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
his
entire
tenure
i
would
say
was
objection
was
to
--
the
old
common
law
privilege
which
was
asserted
on
behalf
of
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
as
i
see
it,
he
is
asserting
it
only
as
a
privilege
of
the
accused.
now
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
correct,
he
made
the
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
the
one
way
he
could
object.
but
he
could
have
requested
the
court
to
inform
her
of
her
rights
to
remain
silent
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
i
think
in
order
to
raise
the
point
for
appeal,
something
must
be
said
in
the
lower
court
to
specifically
raise
that
point
and
that
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
i'm
coming
to
that.
the
question
of
incompetency
i
think
has
been
pretty
well
ruled
on
by
the
courts,
and
it
is
now
held
to
be
a
question
of
privilege.
originally
now,
the
rule
was
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
he
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
objection
here
was
as
i
am
speaking.
now
i'd
like
to
point
also
that
mr.
wigmore,
volume
eight
(inaudible)
2268
approved
the
reason,
which
i
have
just
mentioned
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
kimbell.
now
he
speaking
there
of
the
privilege
yet
self
incrimination
and
i
will
endeavor
to
show
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
you're
quite
right,
mr.
wigmore,
like
most
of
the
writers,
isn't
favor
of
complete
abolition
of
the
privilege,
and
of
course
the
government
has
no
objection
to
that
position
being
taken
by
the
court.
it
would
decide
the
case
favorably,
as
we
think
it
should
be
decided
and
yet
we
think
its
farther
the
court
has
to
go,
to
decide
this
case.
we
think
that
it
is
farther
actually
than
right
and
justice
and
reason
and
experience
required.
now
i
would
like
to
make
this
point
before
going
more
into
detail
as
to
the
question
of
reason
and
experience,
which
is
the
test
in
these
cases,
as
the
court
has
a
very
broad
latitude
in
this
matters,
historically
it
maybe
of
some
interest
as
to
how
that
pans
out.
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
by
section
34
thereof,
seemed
to
make
a
provision
there
that
would
dispose
of
all
questions
of
that
character,
because
it
says
that
questions
as
to
law,
whether
substantive
or
procedural
should
be
decided
by
the
federal
courts
according
to
the
state
law,
or
the
state
in
which
that
court
was
sitting.
however,
they
expressive
language
of
that
statute
was
never
given
much
effect.
the
court
from
the
first,
found
some
excuses
for
going
around
that
statute.
in
a
celebrated
case
of
united
states
against
reid
about
100
years
ago,
the
question
was
presented
whether
a
virginia
statute
affecting
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
now
on
the
federal
court
sitting
in
that
street
chief
justice
taney
reasoned
that
it
did
not.
he
said
that
would
(inaudible)
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
state
subject
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
making
its
own
separate
ruling
on
those
matters.
and
therefore
it
was
the
reasoning
of
the
court
that
the
provision
of
section
34
did
not
apply
to
criminal
matters
and
it
worked
out
according
to
its
own
circuitous
manner
a
rule
whereby
each
state
or
the
federal
court
in
each
state
should
apply
the
criminal
procedural
law
of
that
state
as
it
existed
when
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
was
passed
and
in
the
succeeding
case
of
logan
which
involved
a
state
coming
into
the
union
after
1789,
it
was
held
that
it
should
be
the
procedural
law
of
that
state
or
territory,
at
the
time
of
its
submission
to
the
union.
as
you
will
see
this
bound
the
courts
in
something
of
a
straightjacket
as
to
the
original
13
states
they
were
bound
by
the
law
of
1789,
by
those
coming
in
later
by
the
law
of
the
date
of
their
admission
to
the
union.
so,
sometime
there
had
to
be
a
break,
something
had
to
give,
and
in
a
succession
of
cases
the
court
pointed
toward
a
more
reasonable
rule
and
in
the
case
of
funk
versus
united
states
mentioned
by
mr.
king,
290
us,
that
rule
was
broken
away
from.
the
particular
question
there
presented
was
as
to
whether
a
husband
or
wife
could
give
testimony
in
favor
of
the
other
party.
in
disposing
of
that
and
deciding
contrary
to
common
law,
that
the
spouse
could
give
testimony
of
that
charactery,
the
court
said
that
reason
and
experience
should
be
the
criteria
of
such
determinations
by
the
court
and
that
the
court
was
not
bound
by
the
common
law
as
of
any
particular
date.
that
was
restored
in
the
wolfle
case
and
soon
after
was
annunciated
as
rule,
what
is
it
26
of
this
court,
in
substantially
the
language
of
the
wolfle
case.
so
it
is
now
the
law
under
rule
26
that
the
court
shall
return
matters
competency
admissibility
of
evidence,
the
privilege
all
according
to
the
principles
of
the
common
law
as
the
federal
court
shall
interpret
them
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience.
and
we
are
going
to
attempt
to
show
that
reason
and
experience
show
that
we
should
not
have
any
such
blanket
exclusion,
as
is
contented
for
in
this
case.
before
doing
so
i
would
like
to
make
some
reference
to
the
case
here
and
that
other
point
which
i
believe
perhaps
is
still
in
the
case.
i
do
not
need
to
repeat
the
facts
because
they
were
quite
accurately
stated
by
mr.
king,
one
or
two
very
minor
exceptions,
but
you
will
recall
of
course
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
transporting
a
young
woman,
17
years
old
for
immoral
purposes
across
state
lines,
and
it
began
with
her
asking
him
if
he
could
give
her
a
better
job
or
she
knew
--
if
he
knew
where
she
could
get
a
better
job,
and
he
suggested
that
she
go
work
for
jane,
and
jane
happened
was
his
wife
who
had
been
in
tulsa.
he
himself
took
her
up
to
tulsa
and
although
the
original
place
was,
they
started
out
from
somewhere
in
oklahoma,
they
crossed
over
in
to
arkansas
and
came
into
--
back
into
oklahoma,
and
she
thereafter
engaged
in
prostitution
in
the
(inaudible).
now
the
government
called
jane,
the
wife
of
the
petitioner,
and
she
testified
to
the
only
two
things
as
i
see
it,
that
is
of
any
great
importance
in
the
determination
of
this
case.
first
she
said
that
she
was
a
prostitute
at
the
time
of
these
occurrences,
(inaudible)
she
was
at
that
particular
time
and
she
also
said
that
the
petitioner
did
not
know
her.
now
the
fact
that
she
was
a
prostitute
was
amply
shown
by
other
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
she
testified
as
to
that.
as
i
see
it
that
particular
point
is
not
necessary
to
determining
the
admissibility
or
pardon
me
the
competency
and
relevancy
of
her
testimony,
it
is
always
based
on
the
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
there
was
not,
that
fact
was
assumed
by
her
own
attorney
in
his
cross
examining
of
the
17-year-old
girl.
it
was
assumed
and
made
the
bases
of
their
objection
to
jane's
testimony
that
she
was
the
wife
of
the
petitioner.
so
as
we
see
it,
this
is
a
fact
which
was
established
by
the
record
that
she
was
his
wife,
entirely
aside
from
her
own
testimony
in
the
case.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
because
all
that
was
necessary
to
be
proved
was
that
this
young
lady
was
being
sent
over
there
or
being
taken
over
for
the
purposes
of
engaging
in
prostitution.
jane,
all
other
witnesses
testified,
was
engaged
in
prostitution.
it
was
not
necessary
to
prove
the
relationship
at
all
between
jane
and
the
petitioner.
that
is
simply
relevant
as
a
basis
of
the
petitioner's
objection
in
this
case.
and
mr.
chief
justice
i
want
to
call
you
attention
to
another
thing
in
that
particular
connection,
and
that
is
this,
that
the
petitioner
himself
took
the
stand
and
he
said
that
the
reason
why
he
took
this
17-year
old
girl
up
there
was
to
see
whether
his
wife,
as
he
referred
to
her
and
i
think
that
is
perhaps
another
place
that
brings
it
into
this
case
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
his
ex-wife,
yeah
that's
right,
he
inadvertently
referred
to
her
as
his
ex-wife,
but
then
later
he
corrected
himself,
after
being
prompted
by
his
attorney.
he
said
his
purpose
in
taking
this
young
lady
up
there
was
to
find
out
whether
is
ex-wife
was
engaged
in
prostitution.
they
were
thinking
about
getting,
making
(inaudible)
to
use
his
expression,
and
he
wanted
to
know
whether
she
was
still
engaged.
obviously,
insofar
as
that
gives
any
explanation
for
his
conduct,
he
was
taking
this
young
lady
across
state
lines
up
there
to
engage
in
prostitution
and
immoral
purpose
in
order
to
find
out
something
for
his
own
particular
information.
that
we
contend
establishes
the
immoral
purpose
of
this
charge,
entirely
aside
from
the
question
whether
or
not
jane
was
or
was
not
a
prostitute.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
(inaudible)
the
only
thing
that
that
strode
up
was
whether
it
mentioned
this
a
little
bit
of
testimony
on
the
part
of
his
wife
or
as
he
refers
to
his
ex-wife,
was
sufficient
to
bring
about
a
reversal
of
a
judgment,
which
on
the
entire
record
is
amply
justified
and
amply
supported.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
she
was
in
fact
his
wife,
but
they
had
been
living
apart.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
as
i
see
it
(inaudible)
had
been
ex-wife,
of
course
that
would
create
a
different
situation.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
they
had
not
been
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
government
does
not
place
any
particular
weight
on
that
particular
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it
could
have
been
perhaps
urged
as
a
ground
for
distinction,
but
we're
trying
to
get
the
thing
on
its
broader
ground.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
my
point,
perhaps
i
didn't
make
it
clear
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
are
entirely
correct
about
that.
we
are
not
attempting
to
make
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
i
haven't
finished
my
sentence.
we're
not
attempting
to
base
any
contention
on
the
fact
they
were
leaving
apart.
mr.
justice
whittaker
i
thought
perhaps
made
the
suggestion
in
the
course
of
this
questioning
of
the
previous
attorney
that
might
(inaudible)
that
could
enter
into
the
case
in
some
respect.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
actually
on
their
holding
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
think
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
established
that
proposition.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
but
we
have
no
united
states
decisions
at
all,
as
we
contend
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
was
going
to
refer
that,
now
that
stein
against
bowman
case
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
quite
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we,
exactly
are
asking
that
the
court
abandon,
we
believe
that
the
court
has
been
working
in
that
direction
over
the
course
of
the
years
as
i
will
come
to
that
matter
later
on
in
my
discussion.
it
never
had
been
so
termed,
yes
sir.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
ex-wife
is
misnomer.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it
was
bought
in
by
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
now
i
answer
this
question,
which
is
the
question
which
i
believe
the
court
is
particularly
interested
as
to
the
perpetuation
or
abolition
of
this
discrepancy
in
these
cases.
the
original
rule
was
as
i
have
indicated
one
of
the
(inaudible)
exclusion
of
all
testimony
of
the
spouse
whether
it
was
for
or
whether
it
was
against,
a
spouse
was
on
the
trail
and
blackstone
whose
name
has
been
mentioned,
states
the
reasons
for
the
rule
to
be
this,
that
a
husband
and
wife
were
admitted
to
testify
for
each
other,
that
would
be
against
the
maxim
that
nobody
should
be
a
witness
in
his
own
(inaudible).
on
the
other
hand
if
they
should
be
admitted
to
testify
against
each
other
that
would
be
against
the
maxim
that
nobody
is
required
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
now
blackstone
is
sometimes
thought
of
as
being
(inaudible)
which
you
know
no
doubt
is
but
this
particular
quotation
that
i
have
reference
to,
i
think
is
a
considerable
value
in
showing
the
reason
for
the
old
rule
and
also
showing
to
what
extent
the
rule
should
be
perpetuated.
as
to
the
first
part
of
his
statement,
that
no
person
should
--
that
no
spouse
should
be
admitted
to
testify
for
the
--
i
think
because
the
rule
is
that
no
one
can
testify
in
his
own
cause
that
is
going
by
the
book.
now
persons
are
not
disqualified
by
reason
of
interest
to
testify
as
defendant,
they
testify
and
therefore
and
the
defendant's
wife
may
testify
for
him,
and
that
is
still
held
in
the
funk
case
and
it
is
s4econd
maxim
that
nobody
should
be
required
to
accuse
himself.
that
of
course
is
very
much
the
rule
of
the
day,
and
should
be
the
rule.
as
we
see
it,
the
wife
has
an
interest
when
her
spouse
is
on
trial.
of
course
she
has
a
property
right
in
consortium.
she
has
a
right
of
support.
she
has
other
personal
right
which
makes
her
interest
coincide
with
that
of
the
accused,
her
husband.
it
is
analogous
to
the
rule
that
one
should
not
be
required
to
accuse
himself
that
a
wife
should
not
be
required
to
testify
against
her
husband.
looking
to
the
matter
of
reason
and
experience,
we
will
take
first
the
question
of
experience,
and
that
is
best
shown
by
a
few
decided
cases
as
to
how
this
rule
actually
works
out
in
practice.
it
works
out
with
rather
harsh
results,
which
have
resulted
in
the
vehement
criticism
of
the
rule
over
a
period
of
100
years
or
so.
here
is
one
case
which
the
rule
also
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
the
same
state
as
we
are
here
concerned
with,
where
a
man,
a
farmer,
took
his
little
seven-year
old
stepdaughter
out
to
work
(inaudible).
actually
nothing
else
entirely
different
occurred
and
he
was
tried
for
federal
assault
and
convicted,
largely
on
the
testimony
of
his
wife,
the
mother
of
this
child.
on
appeal,
that
conviction
was
reversed
because
there
is
the
old
common
law
rule
that
a
wife
is
incompetent
to
testify
for
or
against
her
husband.
it
is
stating
good
law
there
they
he
said
it
was
not
fair
play
to
make
the
law.
fortunately
with
this
court
it
is
the
place
of
the
court
to
make
the
law
in
this
particular
case,
because
rule
26
gives
the
right
to
decide
the
law
as
reason
and
experience
shall
dicta.
and
i
might
add
in
that
connection,
that,
that
rule
was
passed
under
express
legislative
authorization,
so
there
is
no
question
of
the
court
invading
the
legislative
sphere
when
it
lays
down,
if
it
sees
fit
to
do
so
on
this
case.
a
new
rule
regulating
the
matter
of
spousal
privilege.
let
me
give
you
another
case
that
shows
how
experience
works
out,
a
case
arising
down
in
georgia,
her
husband
went
to
the
bedroom
with
his
wife
storming
and
threatening
her
with
a
gun,
she
stood
up
and
clasped
her
child
to
her
breast,
and
at
that
moment
he
shot
killed
the
child
clutched
in
her
arms.
she
was
allowed
to
testify
by
the
lower
court,
and
that
conviction
was
reversed
because
he
had
a
privilege
to
get
the
testimony
of
his
wife
under
the
common
law
and
the
same
stated
facts
occurred
in
west
virginia,
this
time
with
the
bullet
piercing
the
child's
head
and
wounding
the
mother,
but
it
was
still
held
on
appeal
that
the
testimony
was
incompetent
under
the
old
law.
i
might
say
right
now
is
this
question
of
incompetency,
that's
particularly
falling
with
my
offline,
but
whereas
the
original
holding
of
the
courts
was
that
all
testimony
was
incompetent,
it
was
seen
first
that
there
was
this
position
which
i
had
mentioned,
where
the
testimony
was
for
the
spouse
and
therefore
they
let
that
in
because
of
spouse
himself
can
testify,
then
it
was
seen
with
this
other
testimony,
which
was
against
the
spouse
was
something
in
which
nobody
had
any
interest
except
for
the
two
partners,
that
is
husband
and
the
wife,
as
it
has
sometimes
been
said,
that,
that
privilege
exists
on
the
part
of
both
her
husband
who
is
the
accused
and
the
wife
who
is
the
witness,
and
it
is
our
position
here
while
there
is
good
reason
for
saying
with
the
privilege
on
the
part
of
the
wife,
there
is
no
good
reason
for
sticking
with
the
privilege
on
the
part
of
a
husband.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
whereas
the
privilege
accrues,
has
been
said
to
accrue
to
both
the
witness
spouse
and
the
party
spouse.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
reason
and
experience
to
justify
retention
of
the
privilege
on
the
part
of
the
party
spouse.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
sir,
no
sir,
that's
not,
obviously
that's
what
i
intended
to
do.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
for
the
sake
of
convenience
i'm
trying
to
use
the
wife
always
as
the
witness
and
defendant
as
her
husband.
now
let
us
look
a
little
bit
more
as
to
experience
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
sir
i'm
trying
to
divide
the
old
rule
into
two
halves,
the
part
of
the
old
rule
which
ruled
out
all
spousal
testimony
was
divided
into
those
--
that
testimony
which
was
for
the
spouse
and
that
which
was
against
the
spouse.
that
which
was
for
the
spouse
was
an
incompetency,
but
has
been
abolished
by
funk
and
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
other
is
the
privilege
–
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
and
that
is
what
we
were
talking
about
today
and
we
are
talking
specifically
about
whether
that
privilege
should
belong
to
the
witness
spouse,
the
party
spouse
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
correct
–
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
--
yes,
yes.
now
going
on
to
how
experience
has
shown
the
rule
of
the
work,
where
a
party
spouse
is
allowed
to
rule,
allowed
to
exclude
the
testimony
of
his
wife.
no
need
to
modify
those,
it's
risen
largely
in
incest
cases
where
a
father
is
alleged
had
made
an
attack
upon
the
child
in
the
(inaudible)
case
where
they
again
were
reversing
a
conviction
but
the
sitting
judge
was
a
former
circuit
judge
who
has
served
in
some
17
counties
there
and
he
--
in
the
course
of
his
dissent
said
that
he
had
found
as
a
matter
of
his
own
personal
experience
that
those
cases,
it
was
almost
always
the
testimony
of
the
mother
who
was
the
only
one
who
could
establish
the
guilt
of
the
accused.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
i
don't
think
it's
self
evident.
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
matter
largely
from
the
results
which
have
been
accomplished
under
the
old
rule
and
then
a
consideration
which
i
intend
to
give
her
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
results
are
shown
by
the
cited
cases,
these
are
cases
where
a
husband
who
has
been
guilty
of
most
atrocious
crimes
has
gone
free
because
of
our
federal
common
law
rule
which
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
he
is
exactly
right.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
agree
with
livingston
and
he
certainly
quotes
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
we
don't
want
to
make
equation
out
of
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
--
we
still
think
that
those,
that
pointed
out
is
absolutely
necessary
for
our
disposition
of
this
case,
we
still
think
that
the
spouse
that
were
the
wives
who
had
ordinarily
should
be
entitled
to
refuse
to
testify
if
she
wishes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
all
i
felt.
we
don't
think
that
the
defendant
accused
should
have
any
right
to
her
(inaudible)
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
know
pretty
well
by
the
results.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
we
know
yes,
that's
(inaudible)
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
and
that
--
that's
right,
that
has
been
mentioned
but
our
state
has
a
great
way
of
the
writing
as
against
that
position.
there
are
some
ways
to
it.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
that's
an
appropriate
quotation;
there
is
a
no
question
about
it,
but
the
question
of
perjury,
the
question
of
interest
those
things
which
originally
our
forefathers
thought
should
exclude
testimony
that
the
tendency
has
been
very
strongly
against
that.
at
the
present
time,
the
tendency
has
to
let
anybody
who
is
willing
to
testify,
come
here
and
testify
to
matters
which
are
relevant
to
the
issue
before
the
court
and
left
the
questions
of
weight
to
be
determined
by
the
jury.
if
the
jury
says
this
woman
is
just
testifying
against
her
husband,
because
she
wants
to
get
rid
of
him
perhaps
they
are
the
best
ones
to
decide
that,
whether
to
say
that
all
women
shall
be
foreclosed
from
testimony.
that
is
our
position,
yes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
yes
i
would.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it's
true
(inaudible)
but
it
seems
to
me,
i
might
say
that
this
is
not
a
point
which
as
i
see
it,
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
disposition
of
this
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
find
out
whether
she
is
or
is
not
willing
witness
you
have
to
bring
her
into
court
just
as
these
cases
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
it,
beginning
in
the
article,
you
have
to
find
out
whether
or
not
she
is
willing
to
testify.
now
i
think
it
could
be,
if
she
says
--
possibly
that
an
attorney
could
take
the
matter
up
in
chamber
before
the
case
ever
came
up
and
if
her
assertion
was
made
at
that
time,
you
know,
reason
why
it
would
not
be
respected,
but
nothing
like
that
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
she
could
i
think
--
i
think
she
could,
and
that
way
she
could
avoid
any
adverse
inferences
then
drawn
from
the
failure
to
testify
in
the
case.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
let
me
answer
that
question
rather
extensively
if
you
please
mr.
justice
frankfurter
by
discussing
the
reasons
which
have
been
taken
to
justify
the
existing
rule
and
then
i
will
show
where
my
reasoning
fits
in
with
that
reasoning.
the
rule
first
given
was
the
reason
of
marital
unity
which
had
great
validity
in
the
time
of
(inaudible)
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
blackstone,
even
blackstone
mentions
that
in
this
connection.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
it
was
in
his
time,
it
was
in
time
of
(inaudible)
it
was
a
valid
consideration
at
the
time
of
blackstone,
marital
unity.
now
i
have
mentioned
that
except
for
marital
peace,
but
i
am
speaking
here
of
marital
unity,
that
husband
and
wife
are
one
and
the
common
law
of
that
one
with
her
husband.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yeah
that's
quite
true,
at
the
present
time
she
has
complete
civil
and
political
equality
and
she
can
sue
for
divorce,
she
can
bring
actions
in
her
own
name,
everything
of
that
character.
that
rule
i
think
is
no
longer
a
present
day
validity.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
that
comes
as
i
would
analyze
it
in
the
separate
reason
which
is
sometimes
given
a
preserving
marital
peace
and
i
am
going
to
discuss
that,
marital
peace
is
the
reason
that
is
ordinarily
given
to
justify
the
continuation
of
the
rule.
now
that
has
a
reason
is
frequently
rather
fictitious
because
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
it
is
frequently
very
fictitious,
perhaps
that's
not
the
exact
word
but
it's
the
general
word
which
i
use
to
make
my
point
simply
this
that
the
wife
wouldn't
be
there
testifying
if
she
hadn't
already
split
up
with
her
husband
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
no
that's
not
it,
but
i
am
pointing
out
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
it
is
frequently
assignments
they
have
i
mean
i
would
give
her
the
privilege
in
every
case.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
she
may
have
a
strong
civic
sense
that's
quite
true,
if
she
says
another
woman
who
has
been
(inaudible)
of
her
money
as
one
of
these
cases
which
they
rely
on,
she
may
feel
this
is
her
duty
to
testify
even
though
she
has
to
definitely
split
up
with
her
husband.
we
don't
say
the
facts
that
she
is
in
--
should
be
allowed
to
testify
only
when
she
split
up,
we
say
that
it
is
a
matter
of
practical
experience
and
several
commentators
have
noted
this,
the
wife
does
not
testify
unless
they
have
already
split
up
that
was
the
case,
that
was
case
here,
they
were
leaving
far
(inaudible)
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
wouldn't
say
that
anything
that
approached
statistically
exactness
has
been
reached
in
these
cases,
now
it
has
been
noted
by
several
commentators.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
others
have
made
the
assertion
and
i
reassert
here.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
the
–
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes.
well
i
think
if
the
government
privilege
is
not,
as
i
recall
livingston's
position
does
not
materialize
from
this
position.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it
was
a
possibly
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
my
understanding
of
livingstone's
privilege
--
livingston's
position
on
this
privilege
is
that
livingstone
would
have
abolished
the
privilege
on
the
part
of
the
accused.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
right.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
that
was
noted
by
mr.
--
by
judge
learned
hand
in
his
majority
opinion
in
the
walker
case
where
there
had
been
a
split
up
and
the
wife
was
suing
for
divorce
and
he
thought
that
it
was
interest
and
matter
of
public
policy
to
encourage
husband
and
wife
to
get
back
together.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
i
wouldn't
go
along
with
justice
hand
on
that.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
it
would
not
do
that,
that's
quite
correct.
there
is
that
countervailing
consideration
and
i
give
to
it
a
certain
amount
of
validity,
however
i
say
that
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
about
so
much
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
it
is
a
consideration
and
you
are
weighing
considerations,
one
consideration
on
one
side
and
one
consideration
on
the
other
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
i
would
give
it
some
weight
in
the
considerations,
but
i
think
the
weight
of
the
society
on
the
other
hand
has
the
--
the
society
has
an
interest
in
testimony
being
brought
in
by
a
spouse
and
that
should
be
given
great
weight
and
if
a
wife
is
willing
to
testify
and
doesn't
feel
that
she
is
testifying
against
herself,
then
she
should
be
allowed
to.
i
think
that
is
as
much
as
greater
weight
than
the
possibility
that
mr.
and
mrs.
walker
may
or
may
not
have
patched
up
their
divorce
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
sir
mr.
justice
black
there
are
no
statistics.
i
would
be
quite
sure
that
it
was
something
of
a
test
to
the
marital
bond
if
there
was
any
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
serious
--
that's
quite
true,
but
still
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggests
a
wife
even
though
is
living
with
her
husband
may
have
a
strong
sense
of
social
responsibility.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
the
congress
had
very
well
--
have
decided
this
case.
they
could
have
enacted
a
code
of
evidence
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no,
they
could
have
enacted
a
particular
rule
relating
simply
to
this
matter.
however
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
confided
that
power
in
this
court
because
it
has
confided
the
power
to
make
rules
governing
competency,
admissibility
and
questions
of
that
character
or
questions
of
procedure
in
criminal
matters
is
confided
in
this
court
and
rule
26,
it
says
that
those
matter
should
be
determined
according
to
the
principles
of
law
as
a
interpreted
in
the
line
of
reason
and
experience.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it
has
been
the
law
but
it
has
been
very
much
on
the
wane
as
i
am
going
to
show
your
honors
as
i
proceed
with
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well,
my
figures
work
out
somewhat
different
from
mr.
king's.
we
found
approximately
eight
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
which
have
decided
in
favor
of
compellability
--
have
decided
in
favor
of
competency
without
compellability.
there
are
perhaps
ten
additional
states
which
have
felt
that
the
client
is
not
only
competent
but
compellable.
now
i
make
that
statement
with
some
trepidation.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that's
18,
that
leaves
the
majority
adhering
to
the
old
rule,
so
it's
no
overwhelming
matters
such
as
we
had
in
the
funk
case
where
almost
all
the
states
had
moved
in
the
direction
which
the
court
took.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
it's
gone
by
statutes.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes,
there
is
some
questions
and
i
start
to
say
as
to
my
ten
states
there
is
some
questions
when
i
mentioned
though
as
to
what
the
judicial
interpretation
of
statutes
had
been
and
therefore
i
make
that
figure
with
a
large
question
mark
behind
it,
but
you
are
entirely
correct
in
assuming
that
the
majority
of
cases
--
states
i
believe
statutorily
have
adhered
to
the
common
law
rule.
it's
stated
in
one
of
these
law
review
articles
38
boston
law
review
at
page
156
i
believe
it
is,
final
paragraph
that
it's
stated
the
dependency
in
the
new
england
state
of
the
courts
there
has
been
towards
competency
without
compellability.
i
haven't
followed
up
actually
the
(inaudible)
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
i
think
that
would
be
a
draw
of
numbers,
correct.
the
majority
is
(inaudible)
figures
is
in
favor
of
adhering
to
the
old
rule.
however
bear
in
mind
of
course
the
great
discretion
which
has
been
conferred
upon
this
court
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
bear
in
mind
the
rule
which
had
been
enacted
and
the
various
authorities
which
have
written
on
this
subject
before
i
discuss
let
me
say
one
or
two
words
further
about
marital
unity.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
act
of
congress
would
have
permitted
such
a
rule
to
be
made
especially
taking
care
of
this.
it
would
have
permitted
an
entire
new
code
of
evidence,
procedure,
it
also
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
is
correct,
true,
yes.
however
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
no
sir,
i
think
well,
considerable
weight
was
given
to
those
suggestions,
about
making
a
code
of
evidence
at
that
time,
was
finally
determined
simply
to
it.
(inaudible)
that
the
courts
would
make
the
rule
as
the
cases
arose
and
was
making
in
the
course
of
tradition
at
the
same
time
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience
as
we
have
seen
in
the
light
of
reason
experience,
the
courts
have
seen
fit
from
time
to
time
to
change
the
laws
of
evidence
and
we
feel
the
court
has
the
full
power
in
this
case.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
well
i
think,
rule
26,
however,
of
course
was
approved
along
with
other
rules
and
the
rule
26
is
the
one
which
leaves
it
wide
open
to
the
court
to
make
the
decision
which
it
deals
as
wide
in
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
that's
--
that's
our
line
of
reasoning
in
this
case
your
honor.
now
the
marital
unity,
not
pardon
me
not
marital
unity
but
marital
peace,
argument
or
as
a
basis
for
the
sustaining
of
the
old
common
law
rule
breaks
down
in
various
respects.
for
instance,
if
a
spouse
is
dead,
surviving
spouse
may
--
there
is
no
marital
unit,
there
is
no
marital
peace,
to
be
preserved
and
yet,
there
is
the
same
question,
should
the
surviving
spouse
be
required
to
justify,
we
don't
think
she
should
because
she
has
the
privilege
for
her
own,
but
the
marital
peace
is
no
longer
the
underlying
reason
for
sustaining
the
common
law
rule.
another
situation
it
comes
up
is
where
the
testimony
of
the
wife
witness
would
incriminate
her
husband
but
he
has
not
yet
defendant
in
the
case.
now
there
marital
peace
is
involved
just
as
much
as
if
he
were
a
defendant
and
yet
the
courts
have
held
that
she
is
required
to
testify
marital
peace
there
is
not
a
good
ground
for
sustaining
the
rule.
and
another
situation
shows
the
extreme
results
that
may
occur,
is
where
there
is
a
charge
of
bigamy
the
question
to
be
determined
by
the
court
is
which
–
is
the
wife
of
the
accused.
usually
the
first
wife
is
presumably
the
legal
wife
is
foreclosed
from
testimony
and
the
second
wife
is
allowed
to
testify.
well
she
has
been
held
in
another
case
that
the
second
wife
if
her
husband
is
claiming
her
as
being
his
wife
then
he
claim
a
privilege
against
her
testimony
and
she
may
not
testify.
as
wigmore
says
that
leads
to
many
identifying
purpose.
another
claim
that
might
be
drawn
in
at
this
particular
point
is
the
effect
of
this
privilege
on
marriage.
sometime
marriages
take
place
in
order
to
silence
the
lips
of
a
witness.
we
have
cited
a
number
of
those
cases
including
one
where
the
man
married
the
11
year
old
complaining
witness
in
order
to
silence
her
testimony
and
he
did
succeed
in
doing
so.
now
as
i
see
it,
marital
unity
as
it
was
formally
seen,
union
actually
in
law
of
husband
and
wife
is
not
more
than
conception
that
is
out.
marital
peace
is
a
reason
which
this
court
can
well
consider
is
the
reason
which
is
of
not
controlling
importance,
we
do
not
believe
and
we
do
not
believe
it
should
be
controlling
in
the
face
of
the
overriding
necessity
for
testimony
of
all
relevant
testimony
by
witnesses
who
are
willing
to
testify.
now,
another
reason
which
is
to
justify
the
rule
and
that
is,
it
is
said
that
there
is
a
national
repugnance
in
matters
of
these
kinds
against
spousal
testimony.
first
let
us
consider
that
from
the
standpoint
of
husband
where
he
is
trying
to
exclude
the
testimony.
we
think
that
is
a
very
little
weight
there
because
her
husband
has
got
himself
in
this
position,
by
his
own
wrongful
act.
and
if
he
say
that
it's
humiliating,
some
of
the
authorities
has
suggested,
it
is
humiliating
to
be
condemned
by
the
testimony
of
one
life
partner,
we
say
it's
humiliating
to
be
condemned
in
any
case
and
that
is
not
a
weighty
consideration
certainly
as
against
the
interest
of
society
on
other
hand.
there
is,
when
you
consider
natural
repugnance
against
this
testimony,
a
question
whether
you
should
require
a
wife
to
testify
when
she
doesn't
want
to
do
it.
and,
as
i
previously
indicated
although
is
not
necessary
for
our
position
in
this
case,
i
mean
its
not
necessary
for
sustaining
the
judgment
below,
that
we
take
this
position,
we
think
that
actually,
all
things
considered
there
is
great
weight
to
the
natural
repugnance
which
is
felt
against
compelling
a
wife
to
come
in
and
testify
against
her
husband
and
that
is
on
reason
that
came
to
the
--
reasons
against
self
incrimination.
the
reason
against
self
incrimination
is
that
nobody
should
be
forced
to
position
a
perjury
or
(inaudible)
or
testifying
in
matter
which
intimately
affects
their
own
lives.
it's
just
as
it
was
in
the
trial
of
milton
many
years
ago
when
the
right
of
an
accused
was
(inaudible)
makes
is
against
the
law
of
nature
because
nature
is
a
preserver
of
life
and
this
(inaudible).
the
accused
then
is
compelled
to
testify
against
–
this
makes
him
testify
against
his
own
wife
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
required
and
the
same
reasoning
applies
we
believe
to
compelling
the
wife
to
testify
against
her
husband
or
if
the
partition
be
reversed
to
her
husband
testify
against
the
wife.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
that
particular
question
does
not
seem
to
have
been
consider
too
much,
i
cannot
recall
(inaudible)–
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
if
that
is
the
consideration
that's
one
of
these
things
which
has
to
be
bought
in
this
(inaudible)
that
this
court
to
the
so
often
told
that
she
has
not
conveyed
the
legislative
sphere,
here
it
we
see
it
passed
virtually
a
legislative
function
to
exercise
because
of
the
very
broad
grant
of
power
and
very
broad
rule
which
has
been
enacted
pursuant
thereto.
did
you
have
a
question
mr.
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
oh
it
is,
i
am
very
sorry.
i
didn't
get
to
view
these
various
authorities
--
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
they
are
and
they
go
for
in
the
government
position
actually
as
the
case.
mr.
kirby
w.
patterson
yes
sir.
