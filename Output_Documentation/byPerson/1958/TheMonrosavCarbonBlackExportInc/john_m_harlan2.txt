and
at
what
time?
is

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
view
of
the
second
circuit
cases?
these
contracts
are
good
unless
they're
shown
to
be
unreasonable
or
that
they
must
be
showing
to
be
reasonable
before
they're
in
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
in
this
case,
i
take
it,
just
specifically
as
a
forum
non
conveniens
case
almost,
authority
for
the
court
to
treat
it
on
that
as
if
it
worse
of
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
bearing
if
any
do
you
think
the
circumstance
has
that
italy
would
not
recognize
such
a
clause
asserted
in
the
bill
of
lading
with
american
ship
owners?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
you
don't
have
to
make
that
assumption
and
answer
to
the
--
to
the
second
case.
the
--
the
point
that
for
thousand
dollars,
it
just
wouldn't
be
worth
it
to
go
to
genoa
--
genoa,
italy.
that
--
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
distrusting
the
courts
of
italy.
it's
simply
an
economic
matter.
is
that
right?
