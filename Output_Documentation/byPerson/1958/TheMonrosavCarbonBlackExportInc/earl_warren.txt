is
there
any
reason
--
is
there
any
reason
why
our
people
wouldn't
use
that
kind
of
a
contract
or
that
kind
of
a
clause
in
order
to
have
the
cases
heard
in
our

as
the

as
other

do
or
theirs?

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
assume
that
you
--
i'm
assuming
in
the
argument
that
that
it's
against
public
policy,
against
the
policy
and
associated
by
the
constitution
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
remember
where
that
was
under
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
to
meet
that
here.
yes
--
does
congress
authorize
this
to
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
agreed
to
take
--
ask
the
court
of
the
jurisdiction
which
in
fact
is
otherwise
given?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
to
face
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
raising
that
question
here
are
you?
you
are
stating
some
constitution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
to
meet
that
because
there's
a
no
statute
to
talk
about
this,
i
understand.
you're
saying
is,
if
congress
has
given
the
court
jurisdiction,
they
can't
oust
themselves
and
the
more
than
they
could
make
an
agreement
that
corporation
is
going
to
a
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
have
to
assume
that
there's
anything
wrong
whenever
they
make
the
statement
as
you
do
not
know
what
they
will
hold
public
policy
be
it
connected
in
any
particular
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
e.
d.
vickery.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
say
with
the
argument
there's
no
mutuality
between
italian
law
and
recognition
of
this
as
a
valid
clause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
when
they
were
so
meticulous
as
they
were
in
this
bill
of
lading,
why
wouldn't
they
in
--
include
the
ship
to
think
that
they
--
they
really
intended
it
to
be
included?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
say
the
owner,
master,
agents,
and
if
they
want
to
include
the
in
rem
proceedings,
why
wouldn't
they
say
or
the
ship
that
they're
rather
meticulous
in
--
in
their
language,
i
would
think?
