justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
the
other
maritime
nations,
what
does
the
english
law
permits
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
brussels
convention
deal
with
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
that
was
left
free
at
that
time.
by
the
way,
had
we
ratified
the
brussels
convention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
convention,
it
came
out
of
the
brussels
convention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
they
do
allow
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said
they
do
allow
them
in
contact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
authorized
specifically
nor
specifically
prohibited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
has
not
come
up
that
you
indicate
in
the
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
the
english
--
do
the
english
line
was
supposed
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
scandinavian
countries?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
--
although
i
think
you
said
our
lines,
the
american
lines
do
not
have
such
a
restrictive
agreement.
do
you
happen
to
know
when
a
suit
--
is
when
--
if
a
suit
in
foreign
countries
with
the
american
lines
raised
the
question
of
forum
non
conveniens?
that's
an
old
admiralty
law
on
that
long
before
the
common
law
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
should
have
the
difference
between
the
duty
to
determine
with
an
agreement
between
two
parties
is
reasonable
and
if
it
is
reasonable
to
withstand
and
having
the
court
decide
as
a
matter
of
discretion
taking
all
factors
into
consideration
that's
on
the
whole
better
of
the
case
be
tried
in
the
forum
in
which
it
was
brought
rather
than
be
sent
somewhere
else.
they
are
two
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
agree
you
say
that,
i
think
what
you
said
earlier
is
true
certainly
both
--
both
namely
whether
an
agreement
between
the
parties
to
have
the
litigation
determined
in
a
designated
tribunal
and
a
determination
by
the
forum
that
instead
of
be
tried
elsewhere
have
any
common
factor
that
on
the
whole
administration
justice
would
be
furthered
if
the
litigation
is
held
somewhere
else
than
in
the
forum
that
it
is
brought
to
be
sure.
but
it
makes
a
difference
whether
what
weight
you
attach
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties
and
again,
the
determination
of
the
court
and
its
discretion
that
on
the
whole
it's
more
desirable
to
have
the
litigation
disposed
of
elsewhere.
what
you
said
earlier
is
true,
but
if
the
party
themselves
agreed,
you
have
a
--
you
have
elements
behind
that
consideration.
if
you
haven't
got
it,
the
court
does
it
of
its
own
volition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
answer
assumed
that
the
parties
aren't
beating
its
arm's
length
and
that
the
situation
doesn't
contain
with
itself
an
ingredient
that
negatives
in
the
--
in
most
instances
as
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
that's
the
problem
in
this
case
really,
but
to
this
court
can
say
on
the
whole
the
parties
are
not
free
to
do
what
they
plea,
but
the
public
element
enters
into
it
which
you
decide
to
answer
in
this
case.
there
are
other
ships,
other
lines
in
which
you
could
have
shipped
these
goods.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
not
proof
of
coercion
as
to
the
particular
contrast
that
in
the
generality
of
instances,
there's
a
presence
of
element
that
is
so
likely
to
operate
with
a
certain
amount
of
unfairness
on
one
side,
but
the
law
says
this
type
of
an
agreement
is
not
to
be
tolerated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
theory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
which
there
is
hostility
to
this
kind
or
reason,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
in
the
passenger's
ticket?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct
if
it's
--
i
don't
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
contract
is
valid
and
you're
bond
by
the
contract
not
to
sue,
you
had
given
jurisdiction.
you
can
be
enjoined
from
suing
there
if
the
contract
is
valid,
not
because
it's
out
of
grace
that
the
court
doesn't
want
you
to
sue
there
but
because
you
bound
yourself
not
to
sue
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
like
all
the
question
agreements.
we
always
use
this
language
of
“ouster
of
court”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
an
arbitration
agreement
is
valid
and
you
contracted
the
way
your
right
to
exercise
the
right
to
go
to
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
determines
whether
it's
a
valid
contract.
if
it's
a
valid
contract
you
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
all
bills
of
lading
regulated
by
any
kind
of
governmental
oversight?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
made
a
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
there
are
terms
in
it
which
are
judicially
declared
to
be
against
public
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
and
then
takes
care
of
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
recognize
the
fact
if
a
shipper
has
a
choice
of
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
we
must
start
this
case
with
the
assumption
that
every
bill
of
lading
which
a
shipper
signed
is
over
reaching
by
the
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
than
that
then
there's
no
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
he
signed
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
signed
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
goodness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
goods
are
delivered
to
the
steam
ship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
whom
is
this
contract
of
adhesion
as
you
call
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
come
here
and
tell
us
the
freight
charges
to
being
unreasonable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
why
are
you
bound
by
the
bill
of
lading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
there
was
no
agreement
between
parties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
there
was
no
mutuality
of
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
argument.
what
i
don't
understand
the
basis
of
the
being
that
there's
been
no
contract
between
the
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
there
were
parties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
because
it's
a
bill
of
lading,
but
because
it's
contents
of
is
substitute
of
affected
from
doctrine
of
law
to
a
statutory
or
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
understand
that.
but
that's
all
there
is
to
it,
isn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
in
fact
the
deciding
point
is
this
a
clause
that
ought
to
be
stricken
down
against
public
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
no
matter
how
much
at
arm's
length
they
are
and
how
(inaudible)
and
how
prominent
and
how
well
known
and
how
fair
the
rates,
the
parties
there
make
such
an
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
in
arbitration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
of
course
you
can
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
thing
it
takes
to
the
extreme
the
arbitration
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
call
(inaudible)
on
the
arbitrator,
he
can
be
guilty
of
murder.
but
the
question
is
whether
they've
agreed
to
take
a
controversy
out
of
the
court
by
arbitration
is
not
constitutional
as
this
court
has
held
it
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
when
there's
an
arbitration
agreement
and
you
bring
this
to
court
and
the
defense
is
made
that
there's
an
arbitration
clause,
that
litigation
and
that
court
ceases.
and
subsequently
the
arbitrators
commit
fraud
or
decide
that
there
is
not
enough
pride,
then
you
can
say
this
arbitration
has
no
findings.
but
that
doesn't
uphold
this
largely
fact
that
the
shipper
and
a
carrier
may
constitutionally
decide
not
to
go
to
court.
that's
what
this
court
is
held,
as
you
well
know
in
264
u.s.
and
the
government
is
subject
that
that
oust
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
because,
they
can
make
an
agreement
not
to
go
court,
that's
all
right
with
regard
to
the
(inaudible)
clause
of
constitution
is
concerned,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i'm
surprised
you
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thing
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
there
was
whether
the
new
york
statute
requiring
an
arbitration
agreement
to
be
enforced
and
taking
the
case
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
violated
article
3
and
the
holding
was,
that
it
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
starting
that
the
proposition
has
no
agreement
by
which
parties
can
voluntarily
agree
not
to
go
to
court
is
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
start
with
that
of
course
you'll
end
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
void
because
they're
against
public
policy.
let's
not
mix
up
things
in
a
very
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
something
unconstitutional,
nothing
can
remedy
it.
if
it's
constitutional,
then
the
question
is
whether
it
can
be
done
either
by
legislation
or
by
agreement.
they're
very
different
things.
but
if
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
people
can't
agree
not
to
go
to
court
because
that
deprives
the
court
of
jurisdiction
under
article
3,
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
congress
didn't
authorize
that
the
new
york
state
legislator
to
pass
the
statute
saying,
you
don't
have
to
go.
indeed,
if
he'll
agree
not
to
go
you
can't
go
to
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
no
limit,
whether
this
court
held
and
that's
only
the
question.
whether
they
have
anything
in
the
constitution
that
precludes
not
going
into
court
in
admiralty
cases.
the
answer
was,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
italy
had
adopted
the
russian
convention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
difference
to
your
answer?
of
course
we
can
assume
any
nation
is
not
going
to
be
as
judicial
minded
as
this
country.
all
it
did
was
to
make
that
assumption
i
suppose,
that
foreign
countries
are
barbarians.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
it
had
no
guarantee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
not
a
guaranty.
how
many
courts
in
this
country
will
decide
on
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
do
you
expect
guarantee
from
italy
except
that
it's
a
party
from
international
convention.
and
it
has
constitution,
it
has
a
court,
like
this
court
is
sanctioned
on
the
congress
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
difficulty
of
having
international
trade.
we
can
--
we
can
have
times
of
war
which
we
put
ourselves
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
to
protect
the
courts
or
to
protect
business,
i
mean
who
does
it
protect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
carrier
decides
for
himself
what
is
good
for
him,
but
not
also
as
civil
liberty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
prefers
to
have
a
speedier
and
a
more
economical
and
from
this
point
of
view
a
more
desirable
way
of
settling
controversy
than
the
proctology
of
the
court
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
case
well
maybe
in
new
york
between
a
ship
and
the
carrier
is
on
agreement
that
the
international
court
has
to
go
to
arbitration,
does
it
say
the
same
thing?
what
decide
one
day
--
one
decides
whether
only
congress
can
make
admiralty
law,
i
suppose
we
make
most
of
the
admiralty
law
and
put
that
to
one
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
it's
between
new
york
where
they
have
arbitration
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
bill
of
lading
says
that
you
be
go
to
arbitration
and
not
go
to
the
court
of
new
york.
that
would
be
ousting
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
entirely
it
means
if
the
arbitration
is
brought
even
if
we
proceeded
again,
you
can
have
a
separate
clause
of
action
for
fraud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
some
federal
proceedings
there
are
always
fraudulent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
where
do
i
find
this
sanction
doctrine
that
you
can't
make
an
arrangement
not
to
go
to
court?
just
where
do
i
find
it?
what
books
can
i
find
it
and
accept
the
court
originating
from
the
day
when
the
courts
were
making
their
salary
would
arrive
from
the
fee
that
litigants
pay.
that's
the
argument
of
this
doctrine.
that
noble
doctrine
that
court
is
paid
by
litigants,
that's
the
source
of
this
doctrine.
where
do
i
find
it
elsewhere
in
that
historical
fact?
that
you
can
oust
for
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
they've
used
it
but
where
do
i
find
it
when
the
phrase
is
challenged
by
the
agreement
of
the
party?
i
find
it
contrary,
all
that
would
be
lawyers
have
written
on
this
subject.
i
think
it's
a
mumbo
jumbo
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
great
story
said
that.
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
that's
a
repetition
of
a
historic
phrase
deriving
from
the
days
when
courts
would
be
paid
by
the
litigants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
you
get
to
the
public
policy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
start?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
you
get
it
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
the
agency
used
that
in
264
the
opposite
was
essentially
held
with
a
footnote
that
indicates
with
justice
brandeis
thought
of
that
doctrine.
or
he
just
talks
(inaudible)
opinion
in
the
record
of
starline
case.
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
that
doctrine
like
other
doctrines
which
i
have
a
history
must
be
examined
to
see
whether
the
history
still
has
validity
in
our
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
tipped
that
in
(inaudible)
rail
road
for
nearly
90
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
am
just
asking
you
when
you
say
public
policy,
that
isn't
just
a
phrase
that's
thrown
in
all
court
in
analysis.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
--
it
is
necessary
to
state
what
considerations
that
should
now
prevail
bars
two
people
who
agree
at
arm's
length
where
there
are
no
considerations
of
prohibition
or
overreaching
from
making
an
agreement.
isn't
that
a
fair
question?
you
just
say,
“well
they've
been
saying
this.”
and
i
say
to
that,
they've
been
saying
it
because
they've
been
repeating
a
bit
of
history
which
is
very
offensive
to
me
at
least,
namely,
a
history
that
derives
from
the
fact
that
judges
were
being
seen
by
litigants.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
not
arguing
that
this
case
are
you,
you're
not
arguing
if
you
have
an
uncertain
that
in
this
case
you'll
rest
on
the
proposition
that
in
fact
the
shipper
was
not
dealing
at
arm's
length.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
should
hold
it
from
the
record
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
shipper
under
these
circumstances
was
not
dealing
at
arm's
length.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
freight
charges,
do
they
derive
--
did
they
derive
from
tariffs
or
they
may
have
a
reference
of
particular
shipments?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
items
in
that
conference,
did
they
cover
all
kinds
of
bulk
or
less
than
bulk
cargos
that
are
presented?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
particular.
justice
felix
frankfurter
icc
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no
as
a
like
in
particularity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
things
did
they
prohibit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
as
to
--
as
to
the
particular
problem
but
what
kind
of
--
the
argument
you
make
is
that
this
question
was
before
congress.
they
chose
not
to
outlaw
it;
therefore,
it's
not
outlawed,
that
ensures
with
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
what
kind
of
things
did
they
outlaw
to
indicate
that
when
congress
wants
