justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
--
has
there
been
any
exclusion
in
any
acts
of
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
one
thing
and
in
other
laws
whether
there
has
been
any
proposals
to
amend
the
act
which
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
courts,
via
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
take
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
for
a
shipper
to
use
the
--
passed
out
in
the
district
court
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable
for
him
to
sue
in
this
country
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
to
have
that
tried
out
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
up
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
had
it
been
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
three
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
that,
if
he
loses
here,
he
can
go
in
italy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
law
would
govern
if
it's
tried
in
italy?
what
statute
of
limitation
would
govern?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
instead
of
cargo,
this
has
been
a
passenger
getting
on
in
houston,
would
the
same
rule
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
in
the
passenger
ticket,
the
same
rule
applies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
would
be
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
that
gets
down
to
is
a
question
whether
when
a
court
has
a
jurisdiction
and
can
decline
it
on
the
ground
that
they
think
it's
unreasonable
to
exercise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
can
contract
to
it
whether
congress
intended
for
you
to
contract
the
way
your
right
to
exercise
your
power
in
court
to
sue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
if
you
read
the
--
the
statute
is
correct,
you
have
to
mean
that,
yes,
but
you
have
to
get
--
read
the
statute.
you
got
to
read
the
statute
which
--
gives
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
those
carry
the
goods
--
carry
the
goods
by
sea
allow
the
carrier
to
put
anything
he
pleases
into
a
bill
of
lading?
you
said
the
restrictions
in
carriage
of
goods
act
itself
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
presumably
if
anything
else
put
in
the
bill
of
lading
not
in
conflict
with
the
carriage
of
goods
act
is
deemed
to
be
a
voluntary
act
of
the
contractor
or
the
party
unless
a
matter
of
public
policy
if
the
court
tracks
it
down
as
against
public
policy,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
mr.
mcgowan
as
you
have
mentioned
that
as
you
started
this
discussion
that
this
was
in
fine
print.
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
an
issue
before
us
whether
is
a
matter
of
public
policy?
the
covenant
should
not
be
given
--
affect
the
course
it's
been
signed
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
does
this
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
it
were
in
a
larger
print,
if
it
were
capitalized,
would
that
argument
fail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
an
act
of
congress
that
use
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
provides
the
court
shall
be
paid
by
the
litigants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
it
somewhat
depend
on
where
you
start
to
where
you
get.
it's
whether
your
start
on
the
basis
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
that
congress
has
the
right
to
give
you
jurisdiction
if
it
wants
to
but
it
can't
taken
away
from
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
think
the
general
idea
that
the
courts
states
have
acted
on
for
a
long
time.
public
utilities
and
carriers
have
great
power
with
those
who
deal
with
them
and
therefore
must
be
regulated.
it
springs
from
any
idea
of
judges
getting
fees.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
mcgowan
do
you
happen
to
know
what
the
practice
is
if
there
is
a
practice
in
this
country
among
shippers
so
far
as
a
--
not
shippers
but
the
carriers
so
far
as
a
clause
like
this
is
concerned
in
their
bills
of
lading?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
case
are
you
referring
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
state
this
--
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand.
you
stated
this
was
the
fourth
congress
and
they
rejected
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
it
indicated
they
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
congress
had
the
right
to
assume
that
such
a
clause
would
be
upheld
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
muller
case,
itself
decided
in
1955
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
rule
has
long
been
otherwise
in
this
country
and
that
such
a
provision
were
not
good.
i've
just
had
it
before
me
in
which
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
declined
to
follow
it
because
of
the
restatement
feud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
then
in
congress,
that
it
was
on
congress
who
try
to
appeal
over--
or
to
try
to
--
somehow
you
can
find
that
congress
wanted
this
clause
to
be
valid
enough
so
that
they
did
not
act
on
it.
why
should
they
have
acted
on
it
if
the
law
was
as
stated
in
the
muller
case
up
to
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
the
few
seems
to
me
to
be
on
the
other
foot.
if
the
law
is
existing
as
the
muller
case
said
was
up
to
that
time
before
the
new
look
had
been
taking
at
it
to
see
that
they
had
origin
from
which
it
came,
if
the
law
was
otherwise
so
that
up
to
then
these
clauses
were
invalid.
why
was
the
duty
on
congress
to
prohibit
it
that
which
it
always
had
been
held
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
why
should
it
reaffirm
the
law
which
according
to
the
muller
case
had
been
the
settled
law
in
this
country
for
a
long
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
anybody
ask
congress
to
cover
it,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
the
muller
new
rule
that
these
conflicts
are
invalid
if
they
are
unreasonable
and
if
so,
what's
the
test
of
unreasonableness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
do
you
think
that
this
match
to
declaration
of
--
of
a
new
convenient
--
convenient
forum
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
is
a
language
have
cost
of
27
and
if
so
which
words
in
that
clause
embrace
specifically
in
rem
--?
